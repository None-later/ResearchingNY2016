Chairmen Reveal

Talent Show Plans

This year's Ail-University
Talent Show, with the theme of
“Kaleidascope,” will take on the
air of a variety show, rather than
the conventional procession of
acts usually associated with a
talent show.

Kathleen O’Neil and Gary
Restifo are co-directing the show
this year. They are resolved to
work as many talented people
into the production as possible.

They are looking for people
talented in production, scenic
design, costumes, make-up,

lighting, and publicity, as well as
talented performers.

A further concept which they
are following aims at the
introduction of new people into
the theatrical community of the
University.

This, they hope, will help
develop new interest in University
productions and give people a
chance to learn about theatre by
participating in all its aspects.

The technical end of the
production is being run by Eileen
Damming, Michael Walsh, Gail
Pantley, and Dennis Iluck.

Kaline Drives In Two

Runs For Tiger Win

DETROIT (UPI)—Classy Al
Kaline, after 16 years waiting to
play in his first World Series,
kept the Detroit Tigers alive
Monday when he slapped a two—
run, bases-loaded single in the
seventh inning to beat the St.
Lois Cardinals 5-3 and send the
Series back to St. Louis.

it was an almost storybook
setting when Kaline stepped to
the plate with one out and the
Tigers trailing 3-2 with the
crowd of 58,634 at Tiger
Stadium exploding in noise after
reliever Joe Hoerner walked
Mickey Stanley on a 3-2 pitch to
load the bases.

Kaline didn’t disappoint the
Tiger fans who've waited 23
years for a World Series as he
poked Hoerncr's second pitch to
center field for a two-run single
that started a three-run rally
and narrowed the Cards’ lead to
3-2 in this Series.

Day Off

The teams will now have
Tuesday off and the Series will
return to St. Louis for the sixth

game Wednesday in Busch
Stadium with Ray Washburn
pitching against either Earl
Wilson or Joe Sparmu of the
Tigers. The seventh game, if
necessary, will be played
Thursday.

Kaline’s hit gave the triumph
to Mickey Lolich, who blanked
the Cards over the final eight
innings for his second Series
victory after being bombed for
three runs in the first inning.

The Tigers, who looked
stumbling and inept when they

before their home fans Saturday
and Sunday, finally made the
big plays in this game and then
came up with a patented late-
inning rally that was their
trademark in the American
League this season. The Tigers
won 40 games this year after
being tied or behind in the
seventh.

The key thing the Tigers did
was keep Lou Brock from
running them crazy after the
ﬁrst inning. Brock did get three
hits but Bill Freehan threw him
out attempting to steal second
in the third and Willie Horton
threw him out at the plate when
he tried to score from second in
the fifth on Julian Javier‘s
single to left.

Brock probably could have
scored if he’d tried to slide but
he came in standing up and
failed to touch the plate when
he bounced off Freehan, who
took Horton’s one-bounce throw
from left

llrock provided a dramatic
finale to this game when he
came up with twu out and twu
on in the ninth al'tcr pinch-hitter
Roger Maris struck out.

Brofk ticked Lolich‘s l-l pitch
back to the mound and Lolich
snared it, ran towards first and
flipped an underhand toss to
Norm Cash at the base.

It was the first time in this
Series that the tying runs have
been on base when the final out
was made and it provided a
frustrating finish for Brock,
who's been the Series star with
u .524 average on 11 for 21. llis
lifetime Series average of .400
on 32 for 80 is also the highest
in Series history,

ngtge Adelphi To Tie

Saturday, the Albany Booiers played their fourth game of the season to a 3-3 tie with Antipiu Uillvclalty a.
the latter‘s Garden City ﬁeld. Adelphi, carrying ﬁve very strong foreign players proved to be quite a match
for the Dane eleven. There was a strong prevailing wind at the ﬁeld and this proved to be a major factor in
the game. Albany won the toss and got the ball and the wind in the ﬁrst and third periods. With the wind at
their backs the Albany players kept the attack in the Adelphi half the majority of the quarter. The visitors

ﬁnally broke the ice at 13:25 of
that period on a tally from Jim
Shear, taking a 1-0 lead. But as
has happened so many times
before, Adelphi marched right
back and scored on a goal by
Caranieolas at 19:10 of the same
period. The period ended with the
score [-1. With the wind now at
their backs Adelphi pounded the
Albany nets with shots but were
unable to score and the score was
still 1-1 at the half. Albany goalie
Terry Jordan, in his first starting
assignment, played a fantastic first
half and made some beautiful
saves in
prevent Adelphi from scoring
when they had the wind
advantage. The seconds half saw

Albany start with the wind and no 

sooner had the play begun to get
heavy than Adelphi socred their
second goal. Czaplicki, their star
right-outside scored on a beautiful
shot and put Adelphi ahead 2-1.
The goal had been scored against
the wind and this discouraged
Albnay. But they fought back
hard and at 19:10 of the period
John Compeau, playing halfback
for only the second time of his
life, took a corner kick from Ed
Campbell and made the socre 2-2.
The fourth quarter was an exact
replay of the third as Adelphi
scored at 1:08 on a goal by
Czaplicki and John Compeau
scored his second goal of the game
at 20:35. This goal, coming with
less than two minuntes showed
the determination of the team in
the face of sure deferat.
