Oneonta State, looking for its
second victory without defeat,
booted Albany frosh last
Saturday, 6-0, under grey and
intermittently drizzling skies.

The state team, made up of
many first-time soccer players,
was hard put against the bigger,
faster, and more experienced
Oneonta eleven, many of whose
members had been on high school
varsity teams.

Three goals in the first quarter
put Oneonta in a comfortable
lead. Albany came close to scoring
in the second period during a
scramble in front of the
opponent‘s net, but could not put
the ball past their tough goalie.
Oneonta made the score 4-0 a few
minutes later in the same kind of
tussle.

in the third quarter. Oneonta
put together two well-organized
and strong attacks to drive two
more goals past the Albany
defense. But Coach Handzel's
“W” formation held any further
scoring in the last period.

After the game, Handzel
remarked that Oneonta, along
with R.P.[., are usually the
toughest competitors. In
preparation for next Saturday's

Match, 6-0

game, against Mohawk 0.0., the
coach plans daily scrimmages and
drills, hoping to bring the team
closer in organization and to mold
an agressive attack. Handzel also
said that the team was hurt by the
loss of Chris Werner and Larry
Bauman to illness.

Outstanding for Albany's futile
attempt were Terry Wilbert, who
played forward, and in the fourth
quarter, goalkeeper, and Larry
Thompson, who was hit hard on
the ear in the second period, yet
went back into the game, blocking
several Oneonta infield drives.

GEORGE WALLACE STOOD in from of the State Capitol and
delivered an address in his home style lingo. Excerpts of his speech was

carried by national television.

Socialist Candidate
Speaks to Students

“The university should be a
plaza for revolutionary activity."
said Peter Buch, Socialist Workers'
Party candidate for Congree from
New York’s 19th district,
speaking here Monday.

Mr. Buch feels that the
American two-party system offers
no real alternative to those who
are dissatisfied. “The blow of a
police club" in Chicago, he said.
was “an echo of the vote you or
your parents cast in 1964 due to
the ‘lesser cvil‘ policy."

According to Mr. Buch, U.S.
involvement in the war in
Vietnam represents not the will of
the people, but part of a
bipartisan program to protect
capitalist investment.

The cold war is not the fault of
Russia or China, Mr. Buch said,
when U.S. bases encircle these
nations.

"Racist institutions resist
change." Mr. Buch said. He cited
the resistance to the Ocean
Hill-Brownsville school board's

demand for more local control oi
schools.

Mr. Buch sees the struggle for
black liberation as a focal point
for America. He feels “The Black
Panthers, far from being nihilists,
bring real thoughtfulness to bear"

on the question of America's
direction.
Hope is also seen is Latin

America, but he cautions radicals
against believing they can make
change alone.

The anti-war movement which
once held Gls in contempt now
finds support among them, he
reminded his audience. He taid.
“Young people and black people
must look to other segments of
the population for support."
Working people are not satisfied
with wage gains which lead only
to tax increases, according to Mr.
Buch.

He believes that working people
will join students, as they did in
France, where a rebellion led to
“the largest general strike in

Wallace Speaks On Capitol Steps,
O’Dwyer Replies At Counter Rally

by Daryl Wager

A sizeable group was
assembling across the street from
the Capitol well in advance of the
scheduled appearance of former
Alabama Governor George C.
Walluco at three o'clock
Wednesday afternoon.

A good deal of iici.iVil.y was
generated by the Brothers. ii black
organization which planned to
show Wallaco that they (lid not
appreciate his personal appearance
on the steps of the Capitol
building by displaying posters and
singing freedom songs.

Spokesman for the group. who
wore black berets and medallions,
announced that their program
would include readings of the
Declaration of independence, Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.‘s "1 Have a
Dream" speech, and John F.
Kennedy ‘5 message to Congress on
civil rights.

The Brothers were joined by
individuals who described
themselves as "independents."
Both groups pledged that heckling

history."
Radicals must abUVe all be wary
of absorption, of selling out, of

compromising in order to win
moderate concessions, said Mr.
Buch.

He believes “the next stage for
humanity" is “the revolutionary
transformation from capitalism to
socialism."

would have no place in their
efforts to inform the Wallace
group of their oppositon to the
third party candidate.

Meanwhile, a crowd began
forming in front of the Capitol
itself. Sepctators waiting behind
police lines were barragcd with
posters declaring. “Equality Not.
Bigotry," “Wzilliice' A Most
Discriminatng Candidate," “Like
Hitler" You'll Love Wallace!" and
"Support Wallace and Get
Whitewashed."

Descending the (Jiipitol st 5
and smiling broadly the governor
was met by wildly waving banners
and posters and the chanting of
“Down with Wallace!" He
managed to make light of the
opposition evident in the
audience, opening his remarks
with the introduction of several
state and local Alabaman officials.

As Wallace began his speech
and became aware of the
appreciable number in attendance
who were adamant in their refusal
to accept his ideas, the former
Alabama governor‘s voice grew in
urgency and in volume, stopping
periodically when the poor
acoustics proved inadequate for
combatting the chanting of the
throng.

Wallaco attacked the young
people in the audience, who were
almost all college students, for
“giving aid and comfort" to the

Communists by organizing food
and clothing drives for Vietnam.

The presidential candidate
stressed his contempt for the
presidential preference polls,
explaining that the current
predicted drop in his popularity is
due a conspiracy of “eastern
establishment moneyed interests“
whcih seek to control election
results through false poll figures.

Wallace would place existing
polling outfits under federal
investigation.

Prcfucing his discussion of the
Vietnam situation. Wallace used
the phrase. MMWhen I become
the President..." which

precipitated a new round of
opposition chants.
Addressing his adversaries,

Wallace promised to send “thirty-
thousand troops, each with a
bayonet“ to protect Washington
from the anarchists. He accused
the Con grass of passing a bill that
would permit Communists to
work in our defense plants.

Wallace explained that the
reason for our presentsltuation in
Vietnam was our failure to look
to our Western European allies for
munitions and manpower.
Wallace's Vietnam policy would
be a military solution to the war if
the Paris talks fail to produce a
political solution by January.

He cited education as the main
cause for the rise in federal taxes
and added that should he be
elected in November, he would
see that the New York schools
and the Alabama schools were run
independent of one another and
not by the federal government,

Closing his remarks, Wallace
declared, “There are more of us
than there are of you and on
November fifth we’re going to
find that out." Waving and

throwing kisses to his listeners,
