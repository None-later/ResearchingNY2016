Catholic pacifists, who were
accused of destroying draft
records, guilty on all three

counts late Thursday after only
one hour and 25 minutes of

spectators shouted, “Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury, you have
just found Jesus Christ guilty."

men, Including two priests,
could each be sentenced to a

Peace and Freedom Party
Candidate Speaks Here

Jude Mage, the Peace and
Freedom Party candidate for
Vice-President appeared here last
week. She previewed the
appearance of Eldridge Cleaver
their Presidential candidate, who
was at the RPI gym this Thursday.

Mage was accompanied by
Lieutenant Jorge Aponte of the
New York chapter of the Black
Panther Party (BPP), and four
brothers of the Albany BPP
headed by Bill Gibson.

Mage referred us to the Peace
and Freedom Party (PFP)
Platform that said, “The Peace
and Freedom Party was formed to
unify the movements which are
seeking radical change in America,
and to create for these movements
a focus and political expression.“

The Peace and Freedom Part is
a coalition between the Black
Panther Party and the PFP. The
coalition was established officially

Tigers Maul Cards,
Lolich Pitches Win

By VITO STELLINO
UPI Sports Writer

ST. LOUIS (UPD—Mickey
Lolich outpitched World Series
master Bob Gibson anti the
Detroit Tigers broke through for
three runs in the seventh inning
Thursday to beat the St. Louis
Cardinals «H and win their first
world baseball championship in
23 years.

Lolich, the rugged individua-
list who drives a motorcycle to
the Tigers' home games,
matched shutout pitching with
Gibson, winner of seven World
Series games including two in
this classic, until the seventh
when the Tigers got one of the
big breaks of the Series.

The break came with two out
and Norm Cash and Willie
Horton on base as a result of
singles. Jim Northrup walloped
a long drive to center field
which appeared catchable. But
Curt Flood, one of the best
centerfielders in the majors,
stumbled as be turned to rtin
for the ball and it sailed over
his head for a two-run triple.

Bill Freehan followed with a
double to left field scoring
Northrup and giving Lolich and
the Tigers a (H) lead over
Gibson, who had pitched one hit

Lowenstein Supporters
Canvass Republicans

A meeting of Students for
Lowenstein was held Monday
night.

Plans were made to canvass the
Fifth Congressional District to
convince a largely Republican
neighborhood to cross party lines
and vote for Allard K.

The meeting was led by (iary

quotes from the Village Voice
describing both liowciistcin atid
his opponent Mason Hampton.

Hampton is a conservative who
advocates blocking integration
and considers marijuana as a
major threat to society and would
like to see pushers punished by
death.

The students met to discuss
plans to go from door to door on
the weekends preceding Election

In speaking of the candidate,

ball through the first six
innings.

That's all Lolich, working
with just two days rest, needed
to enable the Tigers to become
the third team in Series history
to win a seven-game series
after trailing 13-]. He is the
eighth pitcher to win three
games in one series.

The Tigers, a come-from-
behind team all season as they
won 40 games after being tied
or behind in the seventh inning,
were held to one hit by Gibson
over the first six innings.

But the Tigers erupted for
seven hits in the final three
innings ro snap Gibson‘s seven-
game winning streak in Series
competition.

It was enough to beat Gibson
although Freehan then doubled
in Northrup with an insurance
run and singles by Horton,
Northrup and Don Wert pro-
duced another run in the eighth.

A traditional late-s e a so n
standout who likes to pitch iti
cool weather, Lolich was
brilliant as he held the Cards to
just five hits on the mild
afternoon in the mid-60s while
the crowd of 54,692 at Busch
Memorial Stadium pleaded in
vain for the Cardinals to solve
his deliveries. But the only
player to do so was Mike
Shannon, who hit a solo homer
with two out in the ninth, after
the Tigers already had won the
game.

Lolich also stopped the Cards"
running game. In the sixth
inning he gave up singles to
speedsters Lou Brock, who tied
a Series record with ill hits, and
Curt Flood, But then he
proceeded to pick both of them
off base.

Julian Bond

Cancels Speech

In Protest

K N 0 X V I L L E ,
(CPS)--Georgia legislator Julian
Bond, scheduled to address
University of Tennessee students
October 2, refused to appear in
Knoxville because students there
had been forbidden to invite Dick
Gregory to the campus a week
earlier.

“If the chancellor of the
university thinks the students are
too simplevminded to hear
Gregory, they are obviously too
simple-minded to hear me,” Bond
said when he discovered he had
been invited in Grogory’s place, “I
certainly don’t want to poison
student minds."

Chancellor Charles H. Weaver
had denied a student speakers'
program permission to invite
Gregory, saying he had “nothing
to say to the University
community" and that his
appearance would be “an outrage
and an insult to many citizens of
this state."

About Bond's cancellation,
Weaver only said, “I am sorry that
he is not coming.”

“It's not a matter of Gregory
himself," Bond said. “It's a matter
of students' being allowed to
make their own decisions. I
wouldn't care if it were Harry
Truman or George Wallace being
denied permission. The issue
would be the same--freedom of
choice,"

Master Plan Announced

By Gould For 1968

Chancellor Gould last week
announced the 1968 Revision of
the Master Plan, built upon a
series of 46 recommendations to
guid State University‘s further
growth during the next seven
years.

The Chancellor noted the
Revision coincided with the
University‘s 20th anniversary and

described the document as a
“combined effort of faculty,
students and staff, designed to
maintain and expand upon the
great strides in physical growth
and academic achievement which
'have come about during the first
1two decades of our existence."
Chancellor Gould noted that
the first emphasis in the revision is

Button Confronts Herzog

Before 125 Area Clergy

Congressman Danial E. Button
urged Wednesday that we “stop
the bombing of North Vietnam
and rebuild urban America", in
the first of a monthly series of
breakfast forums for area clergy in
the Patroon Room of the Campus
Center.

Guest speakers were
lte]ublican Congressman Button
and his Democratic opponent,
Jacob Herzog, a prominent
Albany Attorney.

Vietnam was clearly the most
important issue discussed, with an
overwhelming majority of the area
clergy against the Vietnam war.

Button charged that it is
unnecessary to “slaughter the
youty". and hopes that the
tragedy of the Johnson
adiiiinistratitni In Vietnam will be
ended with the election of a new
President.

His opponent, Dem, Jacob
llci'zog is closer to Nixon than
littlltin on the war llcrzog
supports President Johnson on thc
war anti doesn't belich wc should
stop the binibing of the North, He
indicated a complete lack of faith
in Ho Chi Minh to neogiate, and
wouldn't risk the Iifc of “one
single fighting man" by stopping
the bombing.

llcrzog feels dissent on the war
is healthy . . ."everyone is entitled
to their own thoughts and
beliefs." lie supports the
conviction of Dr. Spock because
he violated the law aiitl “those
who vtoliite thc law should be
prosecuted,"

He doesn't
conscious objector status because
“it is unputriotic".

The candidates after their
speeches to the clergy were asked
their views on the darfl and
lowering of the voting age. Both
candidates feel the present draft
situation is unfair, ‘

Button said that he would like
to see Congress explore other
ways to do it, possibly a volunter
army, llerzog told me he favors a
lottery and the option of servttii:
in nonmilitary areas.

On the question of lowerin,
voting age to 18, Button stront
advocated ii, and V/lfllll oti to say

believe in the

that “we should let the younger
generation know that the older
generation is willing to transfer
their responsibilities."“l will give
it careful consideration," Herzog
said, adding that hc favored
lowering it, but not to [8.

According to A.D.A.'s rating,
Button is the second most liberal
Congressman in the House.

Button noted briefly that
Wallace was to speak later that
afternoon in Albany and urged
the clergy to hear him speak, cVen
if they disagreed with his views.

unity, identity and excellence set
forth in the Master Plan of 1964.
The prioritiesof growth specify
the nature, quality and scope of
work remaining to he completed
on missions already formulated,

The second emphasis of the
revision is placed upon the
priorities of change that have
taken form from swiftly changing
human values and behavior as well
as alterations in man‘s physical
enviornment.

Some priorities of change, such
as the rising aspirations of our
disadvantaged population or the
impacts of science and technology
upon society, are already clear,
according to the Chancellor.

Chancellor Gould pointed out
that priorities of change guarantee
continuous renewal of the
University. They assure new
relationships between the
institution anti the society it
serves, they encourage
adaptiveness in teaching and
research; they combine
scholarship with social concern to
the end that students may easily
see their i'urturc role of leadership
and responsibility.

“If a student loses his meal
card, the Housing Office
recommends that he should first
check the dining hall and make a
thorough search of all his
clothing. To date, fifteen meal
cards reported lost have been
found. If he does not. ﬁnd the
meal card, the student may
purchase a new one at weekly
rates.

If the card is subsequently
found, the Housing Office will
refund the money for the
remaining meals.

“Because the meal card is
necessary for the student's
freedom of eating in anyone of
the contract dining halls," said
Seyfarth, "meal cards must be
treated as money.

Upon presentation of an
approved schedule card, the
Housing Office will issue a meal
pass to the Campus Center or
Brubacher Snack Bar.

A procedure has been set up for
students who cannot go back to
the contract lunch rooms for
lunch.

The meal pass is worth 80 cents
for lunch and $1.25 for dinner.
When the student presents a meal
pass he must also present his meal
card.

Commuting students may make
arrangements for either of the
meal plans available to resident
students through the Housing
Office.

Please direct all questions to
