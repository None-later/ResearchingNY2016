Fear Wallace

LONDON (UPl)—The assas-
sination of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy dulled much of Eu-
rope’s interest in the U.S.
presidential campaign, but as
election day approaches some
interest is being revived,
largely out of apprehension.

Most Europeans find little
difference between Democratic
candidate Hubert H. Humphrey
and GOP standard-bearer Rich-
ard M. Nixon, but have deﬁnite
opinions on the candidacy of
former Gov. George Wallace of
Alabama and his American
Independent Party.

From Rome to Stockholm and
Moscow to London, newspapers
and private citizens alike
express mostly fear at Walla-
ce's campaign.

When Wallace announced that
Gen. Curtis LeMay would be his
vice presidential running mate,
European newspapers voiced
dismay.

SDS Forms
Draft Council

A student draft counseling
service is one major project of the
recently formed Anti-draft
Committee of the Students for a
Democratic Society, according to
Richard Evans, a junior at the
University and chairman of the
committee, at a meeting on
October 7.

Evans stated that "The purpose
of the committee is to acquaint
the students with their rights
present Sclec live
Service Act, and to inform them
how to use the law to remain out
of the draft,” Another aim of the
group is to gain increased
community support against the
draft.

The committee plans to train

University students as draft
counselors who will work in
conjunction with the existing

faculty draft counseling service
which is headed by John Riley of
the English Dept.

The on-campus counseling
service will be expanded to
include open forums with guest
speakers who will present farious
aspects of the draft. Ramifications
of the latter will assume the form
of individual dorm lectures similar
to the one already presented by
Dr. Riley at Colonial Quad.

A movie, concerned with tl
Boston Draft Resistance Group
was viewed by the committee at
the meeting, Information
pertaining to the draft, such as
material on Canadian immigration
ltt‘WlI, and draft dcfermcnls, was
being made available by the
committee

Apollo Astronauts

Orbit for Eleven Days

By CHARLES E. TAYLOR

CAPE KENNEDY (UPI)—
The countdown for Apollo 7, the
three-man, 11-day test of
America's moonship, entered its
critical last hours "like a
charm" Thursday with weather
remaining the only question
mark for Friday's launch.

Dr. Wehrncr Von Vraun, head
of Saturn rocket development,
said astronauts Walter Schirra,
Donn Eisele and Walter Cun-
ningham were "in a highly
conﬁdent frame of mind, eager
to go."

The astronauts took a last
opportunity to hone their skills
Thursday by spending about an
hour in a simulated spacecraft
and then rested the remainder
of the day. They were expected
to go to bed about 10 pm.

They were to be awakened at
6 a.m. Friday to prepare for the
flight.

"I have never attended a
preparation for a space vehicle
that has gone as smoothly as
has this Apollo 7," said Von
Braun.

The nation’s first manned
venture into space in nearly two
years was scheduled to roar
aloft atop a 22-story Saturn IB
rocket at ll a.m. EDT.

snug for the start of the 4-
million mile earth orbital test
for later ﬂights to the moon.

“The weather is a little bit of
a qiestopm mark," said Von
Braun. Heavy rain was falling
on the Spaceport as he spoke to
newsmen.

"The predictions are good at
the moment but there will be

some shower activity in the
morning. Should the shower
situation indicate that winds

prior to launch may increase
beyond the magic 18 knots (21
miles per hour) ﬁgure, it may
be necessary for the crew to
leave the spacecraft.”

Officials said unmanning the
cehicle after the astronauts
were settled into it for flight
would mean a delay of at least
48 hours in the shot.

It will be the last spaceflight
for Schirra, the «15-year-old
veteran of Mercury and Gemini
shots, and the ﬁrst for Eisele,
38, and Cunningham, 36.

Must Prove Safety

The object of the ambitious
Apollo inaugural is to prove that
the iii-ton moonship — the
world‘s heaviest manned space-
craft—is safe for a 500,000 mile
round trip to the moon.

The launch of Apollo 7 will
come almost 20 menths after
the ill-fated Apollo I ship was to
have started manned flight
testing.

goals of graduate students will be
by participating in the decision

LBJ Gives Up Fight

Warren Continues In SC

WASHINGTON (UPl)—~Prcs—
ident Johnson gave up the fight
Thursday to name a new chief
justice to succeed Earl Warren
before he leaves the White
llousc.

Eight. days after hr- withdrew
his appointment of Justice Ahc
Fortas for the job in the fact- of
a Itvpulilicairlcd filibuster, the

President, issued a statement
saying he would not submit
another nomination to the
Senate.

llc said it would be best if the
77-year<old Warren defer his
retirement plans and remain on
the high court “until emotiima~
lism subsides, reason and
fairness prevail,"

This was an obvious referenco
to the Senate's refusal to
confirm li‘ortiis, his old friend
and confidant, to be Warren's
successor. 'l‘hc President. with-
drew the nomination at Fortas'
request, as well as that of
unotht-r friend, Federal Judge
llonicr 'l‘liornherry of Texas, to
become an associaLc justice in
l“ortu.-;' plncr.

In asking to retire, Warren
noted he would stay on as chief
justice until his succussor was
confirmed. The Senate rr-bul‘f to

O’DWyer To Lure ~ill-J'nionm‘en;

    

Fears Wallace’s Strength

NEW YORK (UPl)- Demo-
cratic senatorial candidate Paul
O'Dwycr announced Thursday
he will make a major effort to
lure blue collar workers away
from third party presidential
candidate George Wallace al-
though the two are not compet-
ing against each other.

The first event will be a mass
rally of union members to be
held in the garment district of
Manhattan at noon, Oct. 24, the
day Wallace has scheduled a
rally in Madison Square
Garden.

ln announcing his campaign
among unionmen against Wal-
lace, O‘Dwycr criticized his
Senate rival, Rciublican incum-
bent Jacob K. Javits, although

he stopped short of calling him
“soft on Wallace" in answering
a reporter‘s question.

The candidate said Javits had
come out in opposition to the
former Alabama governor but
not in any place where it would
have any effect on Wallace’s
strength among blue collar
workers. He cited Javits‘ failure
to say anything about Wallace
Wednesday when he spoke to
the iron workers.

O'Dwycr said Javits‘ support
among labor cam. from union
leaders who were “not wrest-
ling with this problem" of Wal-
lace, while O'Dwyer's support
came from the “rank and file."

An aide of O'Dwyer said a

meeting with union leaders rep-
resenting 60 locals resulted in
the decision to hold the garment
center rally.

lie said another rally of labor
men would be held next
Wednesday at Manhattan Cen-
ter at which further plans for
developing support among blue
collar workers will be made
and plans for the garment cen-
ter rally made ﬁnal.

O'Dwyer said he was making
the effort to win labor votes
away from Wallace because if
the campaign polls are correct
and the election were held to-
day, Wallace would get 2 mil-
lion votes in New York State,
or 25 per cent of the total.
