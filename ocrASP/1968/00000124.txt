Barriers

Whether the white barriers should be taken

down or not is not the basic issue behind the
controversy concerning the gates about the
perimeter road. The principle under examination is
whether the human element on this campus is
actually being recognized by the physical plan of
the University.

Theoretically the campus was to be reserved for
people and no vehicles were to be allowed to
interfcr with the pedestrian. Unfortunately. this
view is still held by sonic on this campus. These
people sincerely think that tltis system is designed
for the human element. but it is not. Too many of
the present plan‘s adherents have not

acknowledged tltat tltc age of the automobile arid
of general affluence ltas affected the University as
well as the American society.

The atttomobile ltas become ait integral part of
life to the human element on this campus. as it has
to the general public. To deny its existence is to
deny the person what he feels is natural. The
pltysical plan, then. is demanding that the people
on tltis campus do the unnatural.

By prohibiting students from bringing their cars
near their living areas. the physical plan. that is
presently being adhered to. is artiﬁcially restricting
the student. We do itot feel there is any theoretical
support for the barriers that were erected about
the campus.

However, there is a valid argument that if cars
were allowed. the chances of a person being lturt
by an automobile would be probable. Most all
accidents would be the result of speeding on the
fire lattes. Yet. this danger could be easily reduced
to negligible proportions if the roads that form
straight connections between two points of the
Perimeter Road could be blocked off at both ends
so through traffic could not pass. The rigltt angle
tiiins oil the fire lattes would aid this technique of

blocking straight thoroughfares to slow down the

 

autos.

If this method is not fully successful, then, the
road could be paved with built in bumps so the
vehicles would have no choice but to drive slowly.

Last year when the attempts to keep cars out of

the residence areas failed, it was threatened that
cars would have to be towed away since they were
blocking the fire lanes. The cars blocked the fire
lanes because the obvious place to park (on the
stories) was blocked off. Automobiles should be
allowed to park on the pebbles as they are soutlt
of the Joseph l'lcnry (Physics) and Chemistry
Buildings Because there is tooth to park smite 100
atitoittobilcs around each quad. and because of the
nature of student parking, there would be little
chance of dotible parking. The fire lanes would be
clear attd emergency vehicles could get to the
buildittgs.

If the parking areas about the quads were
cleared every night by ticketing the parked (not
standiitg) cars iii the early hours of the morning.
tlicit the students would use the parking lots.

The students who Would be using the parking
area about tltc quads tltcii would either be using
his car again that day or picking tip or leaving off
soincone or something. At no time do we see over
a ltuttdrcd velticlcs parked about the quads (except
during the period of moving ill to the dorms).

A substitute would be needed for the pebbles.
since the cars would sink iitto the intid dtiriitg the
spring. Also. there itiigltt be a need for more
security at night, bttt these problents are minimal
and itot serious obstacles to overcome.

We see no reason for the gates to have been
erected except for the fact that a philosoplty alien
to human nature has been the policy concerning
the physical plan of the campus. Because of this
policy. the student is faced with art unnecessary
inconvenience. lt is fesible aitd practical tltat the

barriers cotne down.

Langley Urges Student Support

Walter P. Langley, Republican
Candidate for State Senator from
the fortieth Senatorial District.
speaking at a University
conference Monday sponsored by
the Forum of Politics, stated his
belief in the necessity of student
support in the local issues.

In his forty-five minute speech,
Langley criticized his opponent.
Julian B. Erway, on his practices
and his disregard for civil duty.

One of Langley‘s major goals is
to “overcome fear in the
backwoods, " by teaching the
voters to vote.

A “tremendous amount of
voter registration" has to be done.
said Langley. “but first the fear
must be eliminated."

Fear. Langley charged. arising
from the forty-seven-year reign of
the Democrats in Albany pervades
the educational system, police and
fire departments, social groups
and even the local Bar
Association.

Langley, the candidate from
Albany and Schoharie Counties.
believes the voter is afraid to vote
Republican, thus the lack of local
GOP support.

His central issue now is “not
what kind of representation the
voters want. but do they want
representation?" Langley
pronounced the local Democratic
officials as not. working for the
people.

He proposed to reduce real
property taxes by ending
unfairness in distribution of state
aid and also by making the state
pity real property taxes.

Campaigning activer for
several months. the GOP hopeful
endorses the lowering of the
twenty-one‘ycar-old voting age.

He is presently counsel for the
Republican Minority. Albany
County Legislature and is a tax
attorney in the Albany law firm.
Langley and Kinum.

Formerly. Langley has been
instrumental in improving Albany
housing and in enforcing Multiple
Residence Laws, in working for
the outlawing of the “five-dollar
vote" or the buying of votes.

Speaking of Albany politics in
general. Langley viewed that the
city machine has somewhat
improved but there is still "much
to be eleitned up."

When the NAACP wished for
the use of voting machines in an
attempt to instruct the people in
voting procedure, the city
obstructed the request.

Langley, running for the
second-highest local office, noted
that he needs l8,()05 votes to win
against Erlay. the present State
Senator.

He supports Nixon as the GOP
Presidential candidate, but feels
that Governor Rockerl‘eller would
"make the best president."

Referring to himself .~ :i

~ “3.. Mo... 

 

“moderate. progressive. modern
Republican,"Langley believes the
State Senate is where he can best
help the people. by not being
caught up in the local machine,
nor by getting too far from the
voters.

Expressing need for student
volunteers. Langley urged further
student support for local
candidates, just as youth
supported Eugen McCarthy's bid
for the Presidential candidacy.

FCC Admonishes NBC
For Quiz Show Fraud

WASHINGTON (UPI) — The
Federal Communications Com-
mission accused the National
Broadcasting Co. Thursday of
misleading the public by provid-
ing guest celebrities on two
television quiz shows the
questionsﬂand in some cases
the answers—prior to the
Drograms.

This was the second time in a
month that the commission had
raped the knuckles of NBC for
alleged failure to maintain its
responsibilities to the public.
This time. the admonition had
teeth in it.

The commission told NBC its
"lax procedures" in the conduct
of the network quiz show.
“Hollywood Squares" and the
"PDQ" program shown only on
five NBC-owned stations. would
be considered during its applica-
tion for renewal of the license
l'or KNBC-TV, Los Angel”,

nit-[ital] Sept, 13. the FCC
chustized NBC for not informing
its viewers that network news-
caster Chet Huntley had an
interest in the meat industry.
The admonition came after
Huntley broadcast radio editor-
ials against the so-callcd clean

.meuy bill in Congress.

Communications V

In that decision, Commission-
er Nicholas Johnson dissented
and suggested the commission
go much farther and consider
the breah of public responsibili-
ty in connection with the
pending application for KNBC's
license renewal.

"PDQ" is produced under the
supervision of KNBC. It is also
carried on NBC’s four other
wholly-owned stations in Wash-
ington. D.C., Chicago, Cleveland
and New York City.

Gun Act Passed

By ANN WOOD

WASHINGTON (UPI)—Near-
ly five years after President
John F. Kennedy was assassin-
ated with a mail-order rifle.
Congress Thursday approved a
virtually total ban on interstate
shipment of guns and ammuni-
tion.

The compromise bill, expand-
ing an earlier restriction on
pistols to cover riﬂes, shotguns
and ammunition. was given
final passage by the House and
sent. to President Johnson for
his signature.

 

Lock Doors

To the Editor.

After a two year absence. 1
again feel it necessary to write
your distinguished newspaper. I
feel that I must take exceptioti to
your editorial of last Friday (Oct.
~l) concerning “Locked Doors."

There is one excellent reason
why the women‘s dorms should
be locked at night and it is a
four-letter-word: rape. Certainly.
Mr. Cromie. non-residents wander
about the men's dorms after hours
with no complaints. I will be the
first to agree with thatb. But then,
when is the last time you
remember someone being raped in
a men’s dorm?’.’

if the women‘s dorms were
open all night, it would be an
open invitation to all rapists. it is
certainly im possible to have
security guards at all the entrances
to all the women’s dorms. despite
the wonderful security force we
have here at SUNYA.

You say “The women can lock
their suite t'ctttiiiit
secure." 'l‘rue. lint let‘s not
inconvenience these poor girls atiy
more than possible. What about
the girl who prefers lllt' quiet ol'a
lounge to study iit late at night?
Or the girl who has a considerable
amount of typing to do and seeks
a place outside her suite where
sxlie will not disturb her sleeping
stiitcmiites? Would any girl feel
“secure” ouLsitle her suite if she
knew there might be men
wandering about. her dorm?

I thus ask you to reconsider
your position concerning the
“locked doors."

Revolution

To the Editor of the ASP:

The United States of America
was founded on
revolution-violent revolution. The
success fo the American
Revolution has had a profound
effect on the history of human
society. holding out hope to the
oppressed of the world that they
can effectively resist their
oppressora, even against what
appear to be overwhelming odds:
The most widespread
manifestation of this phenomenon

was the mass refusal. after World
War [1, of Asian and African

nations to continue to submit to
the humiliation and exploitation
of European colonialism. The
Vietnam War of today has its
origins iii this revolutionary
movement to tiVerthrow Western
domination of the Third World.

It is a paradox of human nature
that there is no reactionary like
yesterday's revolutionary. 'l'be
increasingly countcrrcvolutionary
nature of the Dulles-Rusk foreign
policy we have adopted is a
reflection of this paradox. ()ne of
our greatest miscalculations is the
belief that the forces that have the
most of lose by re-distribution ol'
resources can somehow be urged
to “guide” revolutionary
development. Such a "guided
revolution" is no revolution at all.
but. at best. a grudging. minimal
response to conditions which call
for radical change. Proof of this is
our pathetically unsuccessful
attempt to get the Saigon
government to implement land
reform while we figltt their battle
against the truly revolutionary
forces of South Vietnam. It is
signifirant that the government of
South Vietnam has become rvvn
mort- rcpri-ssivc and less
responsive to the needs of its
pt‘nplt‘ as it has been shored up
and strengthened by the foreigti
military intervrntion of the
United Status.

Our government has repeatedly
defended its military action iii
Vietnam as necessary to guarantee
security from communism to the
developing itiitiotis ft) the world.
We seem unable to understand
that the paramount need of the
people of these developing
countries may not be security
from communism.

What they l)t!l!(l"illl(l what we
are unable or unwilling to help
them achieve-dis security from the
oppressive conditions of groas
maldistributiou of wealth which
invite internal revolution and
communist infiltration.

Secretary of State Rusk tells us
that by fulfilling our
“commitment” in Vietnam, we
have instilled confidence in the
governments of all the
non-communist nations of Asia.
Africa and Latin America. that we
will support them against titty
eoinmunist‘inspired l‘war of

national liberation".
Unfortunately, that is exactly
what we have done and, in the
process. we have destroyed any
incentive they might otherwise
have to enact badly needed social
and economic reforms.

We have. in effect, told every
tyrannical oligarchy in the world
lhat, faced with a popular uprising

by its desperate and
undernourished masses. it need
only scream “COMMIE!” and
