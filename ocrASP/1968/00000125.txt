The Right Way

by Robert lumen

 

It's hard to believe that only a
little more than eight years ago
our eyes were on Senators John
Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey
as they fought for the Democratic
Presidential nomination in the
West Virginia primary campaign.
Kennedy had won an indecisive
Wisconsin victory and it was West
Virginia that would make or break
his candidacy. Most of us were for
Humphrey then; the crowd that
took its cues from the “New York
Post,” and Mrs. Franklin D.
Roosevelt. We wanted Humphrey
and our “impossible dream" was
of Adlai Stevenson. John
Kennedy was for a later year, if
ever.

The Kennedy campaign was a
blitz. Kennedy money poured
into hungry West Virginia to
produce an effort with all the
glamour, excitement and style
that was the hallmark of that
family before the two murders.
The Kennedys jetted all over the
state while Hubert Humphrey
tried unsuccessfully to keep up in
his battered campaign bus.

Humphrey was trying to prove
that a poor man could be elected
President--wilhout a plane,
without an organization and
without big money support. It
was no contest.

On Primary Night Hubert
Humphrey walked into his
headquarters to announce that he
was withdrawing from the race.
His people wept as Humphrey

spoke.

1 think that Hubert Humphrey
learned something from that
experience, He learned how to
play the ball game and it is hardly
his fault if all of a sudden in 1968
somebody changed the rules. For
a while the system worked for
him. He became Vice-President
and for his term’s duration he
supported his President. After all,
was that not the way
Vice-Presidents became
Presidential nominees? For once
in his life he listened to the
cynical men who run American
politics and he won. 'l'oday
Hubert Humphrey is his party‘s
nominee for President.

He runs against a man who
always knew the score. Richard
Nixon has no conflict between his
youthful idealism and his
pragmaticism of today. Nixon
started without illusions. He
began his career with red-baiting;
he won a Senate seat by calling a
great woman a Communist
symphathizer. lle grabbed
headlines by nailing Alger lliss.
He, when exposed in “152 as
something less than the
personification of integrity, wept
before the ’I‘.V. cameras and
begged our forgivenes:

He ran for President and lost;
learning nothing in the process.

learning only that the press was to
blame. He spent six years backing
every reactionary Republican in
the country until he could, in
August, accept his party’s
nomination with inspiring talk
about a poor Quaker boy who
lisnned to faraway trains
That’s Dick Nixon.

Hubert Humphrey’s record is a
good one and we all know it He is
responsible for the 1963 nuclear
test ban treaty, for most of the
civil rights legislation of the past
twenty years, and for the pence
program. He is a great progresswe;
The Peace Corps was his idea. He
is most vulnerable on the issue of
Viet Nam but he has promised to
end the bombing if he is elected.
That’s a start.

The relative merits of the Vice
Presidential candidates need not
be discussed. Agnew is a buffoon;
a bullnecked old line politician
who is not qualified to be
governor of Maryland. Nixonzs
choice of Agnew, to please Strom
Thurmond, when he could have
had Lindsay, Hatfield or Percy

shows that their is no l‘new
Nixon." Four years of the
Nixon-Thurmond Administration
should be enough to make nuclear
holocaust appeal to some as an

attractive way out. Senator
Muskie is the one candidate who
can talk to thestudents the way
Kennedy and McCarthy did. He
shares our reservations on the war.
We can use him on the high
councils of our government.

So therefore I say, without
apology, that I will support
Hubert Humphrey. We all should.
Humphrey should not be the
scapegoat of those in our society
who oppose the present course. I
too am sorry that he did not
speak out against the war, and
against the President.

But one should not blame
Hubert Humphrey. One should
blame a system that makes it
impossible for a man to be true to
his ideals and stay in office. One
should blame a system that allows
only men with millions of dollars
to speak out without fear of the
financial consequences. One
should blame America.

I shall vote for Humphrey
because he is Humphrey; forgive
me, I don't think that he is a
Fascist or a killer or any of the
other things that the “New Left"
so glibly calls him. And as for
you; when you shout about how
you will never vote for
Humphrey, do this one thing:
Consider the Alternative.

by JI M SMALL

One of the few contemporary
issues on which members of the
left and right can find agreement
is their common dislike of the
draft. It is not necessary to list
the faults of the system.

The inherent economic and
racial discrimination found in the
draft is widely known. I think the
prevalent attitude among
Americans today is, the
peace-time draft is unsatisfactory,
but we haven’t been offered a
workable alternative.

However, in this election year a
candidate has provided us with an
option, an all volunteer army.

Two major questions are
immediately raised when such a
plan is proposed. Will it endanger
our national security? How will
we get enough men to volunteer?

In responding to the first
query, we must examine the
nature of future conflicts. It is
highly likely that we have seen
the end of conventional world
wars. Another war on a
world-wide scale would almost
certainly be a nuclear conflict

Future engagements such as
the war in Vietnam, however, are
real possibilities. For this type of
limited war a well-trained.
specialized soldier is needed, not

 

 

With elections only one month
away, the country is in an uproar.
The Albany area is being plagued
by the crime that all three of the
candidates are pledged to stop;
the “war” in Viet Nam is still
grinding on; the people don‘t like
it.

Quite a number of us are
qualified to vote in this election,
for many it is our first
opportunity to help select a
president for this country. Aside
from the fact that we aren't
represented by the candidate of
our own choosing, we can be a
significant force in the coming
balloting.

making an effort to appeal to thr
college students, or the
“over-educated." That is good,
because he has nothing to sell to
most of us. What is a race like
this, if not a massive attempt to
sell an individual to the people At
any rate, he has a very small
following among the college
people of today, and I encourage
all of you to make it even smaller
by stopping even your most
unconscious prejudicial tiClltltLS
Richard Nixon, who I once
heard touted as the man who can
snatch defeat from the jilWS of

Wallace 1in ‘t even

victory, is the man I most fcaﬁn
the office of President. He has
blazed a trail of propaganda across
this country, and the way he
works spells disaster to the
present liberal movement. He
plays exquisitely on the emotions
of his audiences; rather like an
accomplished organist. He always
gets the desired result.

The first time I heard what
sounded like a policy statement
from the man, was on a record.
Perhpas some of you remember
Simon and Garfunkel‘s “Seven
O'Clock News." It is on the
Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and
'I'hymc album.

Now we come to the man with
everything to lose and very little
to gain; Hubert H. Humphrey. He
has the worst problem, because of
his subservient position to
Johnson and Johnson‘s policy
makers. l'le's damned regardless of
his action.

This is the man that l am asking
you to vote for; not as the best
man for the office (McCarthy was
better in my opinion) but as the
lesser of several evils.

If either Wallace or Nixon are
elected, l am afraid of the
unnecessary violence that they
will cause by trying to slop the
liberal movement.

It was announced by the
administration today that a water-
t'illed ditch will be constructed to
compliment the foxholes now
surrounding Colonial Quad. No
announcement was made
concerning the function of these
preparations.

Food Service surprised
everyone today by serving corn
without peppers, peas,
mushrooms, tomatoes, etc.
thrownin.

Students have also been
surprised to find that served meat
is now tiisLiog better, what there is
ill It, and that servings of potatoes

have increased, with a
corresponding worsening in taste.
Food Service, also, has had to
suspend its policy of basting its
food with laxitive as part of uncw
program to eliminate waste.

Zenger llall still holds the
University toilet flushing record
set last year. At that time a
second floor toilet flushed
continually for seventy-two
recorded hours.

Food Service is still serving
seconds this year. After you finish
eating it, you may return to the
serving counter and be served with
seconds of seconds.

The conflict of the year seems
to be stemming from whether or
not Central Council will find Don
uenetles newspaper, The Sheet of
the Piece.

Central Council has denounced
North Korea; YAF has denounced
Central Council, SDS has
denounced YAF‘s denouncement;
and the crew of the Pueblo don't
know it.

Question: What ever happened
to LAAC's resolution supporting
closed doors at open houses? Who
ever said that door's weren’t
closed anyhow?

HHH has in the past and
present shown his willingness to
let the fringe groups on either side
of center work with a minimum
of interference. In other words. he
doesn't discriminate and he has
solid liberal background.

merely troops in large numbers.

The situation in Vietnam, for
example, demands a relatively
small number of highly skilled
soldiers. Thus our future need is
for a small, efficient, professional
army; precisely what a volunteer
system would produce.

The second question concerns
attracting enough men to military
life. Unfortunately, the call of
patriotism will not be sufficient;
we have to make military careers
financially enticing. This can be
accomplished without further
burden to the taxpayer.

Since our army design will
be much smaller than it presently
is the money now being used to
house, clothe, train, feed, and
even draftcould be applied to
increased salaries and benefits.

Before you get the impression
that the title of my column is a
misnomer, let me make on thing
crystal clear. Today, regardless of
its shortcomings, the Selective
Service System is the law. I
realize that I too am a pawn on
General Hershey’s chessboard',
but I refuse to sympathize with
those who flee to Canada, burn
draft cards, and lie down in front
of troop trains.

In fact, I hardily applaud when
these people are dealt with to the
full extent of the law.

Any change in the system must
be made by democratic process.
True, minority groups and the
poor have long suffered under the
draft. We have sought a national
leader who would alter or abolish
the selective service method of
recruitment.

Finally we have found a man
who has pledged to establish a
volunteer army. And who is the
one who will make this change?
NIXON‘S THE ONE!!

Unite

To Destroy Machine

Under the leadership of
Dartmouth Senior. Donald
“Chip” Elitzer, an organization
has been created in the Albany
area which cites as its main
objective "the smashing of the
Albany Democratic machine."

Elitzer has taken a term leaVe
from his studies at Dartmouth to
“view Albany politics firsthand
and to have a part in its reform."
He hopes to use the techniques
that seemed to have been so
successful for Sen, lEugene
McCarthy in his primary
campaign.

He was an active member of the
McCarthy campaign in California
and has voiced the hope that
through student work he can help
“Bust up the machine for good.“

Students throughout the area
have been working with Elitzcr as
he concentrates mainly on door to
door canvassing.

Students from Russell Sage,
lt,l’.l., Union and some from
Albany State have been

instrumental in his drive.

The group is non-partisan, and
members of all political
persuasions have been urged to
Joln.

According to Elitzer, the bulk
of the students working with him
are former McCarthy, McGovern,
Kennedy, and Rockefeller
supporters.

However, in its drive, the group
has endorsed only Republicans,
the most notable of those being
Arnold Proskin, candidate for
Albany County District Attorney,
and Dan Button, incumbent
Republican Congressman from the
29th Congressional District.

Elitzer was very much
impressed with the need for
reform in the area. He citecl'the
corruption in the area and called

the political situation in Albany
“a miniature fascist state."

The group does mainly all of its
work on weekends, specifically
Saturday mornings.

Every Saturday morning there
is a short general briefing meeting
at which the students are given an
idea of what they are to do in the
next few hours.

These meeting take place in
Lecture Room ii at 9:30 AM. on
the University Campus

On the University campus,
Elitzer has been working with the
Young Republicans, who also are
working for the election of
l’roskin and Hutton.

He has reiterated that there is a
great need for anyone who is
interested in helping “smash the
machine" to begin working now,
since less than four weeks are left
until Election Day.

All those interested are to
contact Chip Elitzer at »l77vtil7 l,
or Cathy Bertini, president of [he
Young Republicans, al vl57~787-l.
