FILMS '

by Dave Bord well

 

In one steamy southern town in
summer, mix together two deaf
mutes (one of low intelligence), a
slow-to-ripen tomboy who loves
Mozart, her crippled father, a
proud Negro doctor who hates
white, his daughter who hates
him, her husband (also a cripple),
an alcoholic drifter, a knife fight.
various race tensions, a
deflowering, a slow death from
cancer, a sudden one from a
kidney ailment, a yet more
sudden one by SulCldC‘dnd
you've got "The Heart ls a Lonely
Hunter," which despite the
isolated excellenCe of Alan
Arkin's performance seems to me
one of the most ill-conceived and
sloppily realized films of recent
months.

I haven't read the Carson
McCullers novel (and now have no
desire to) but I assume there the
theme is depicted with a certain
economy, Not so in the film. It‘s
much too long; nearly every scene
could make its point in about half
the time, For instance, does the
prologue establishing the mute
Singer’s reason for coming to
Jefferson need to be garnished
with so much extraneous detail?

What about the subplot of the
drunken drifter, who exercises no
influence on the major action and
vanishes tworthirds of the way
through: Why need the Negro
subplot be given so much
development, to so little effect'.’

And who's supposed to be the
center of consciousness? (A plot
as complicated as this needs some
indication of point of view; I
don‘t ask for one single viewpoint,
only some consistency and point
to the shifts.) In the art of the
film, less is more; here the
feebly-realized sequences thrash
slowly past and begin to
accumulate a deadly rhythm that

pervades the whole movie; more
and more becomes less and less.

To the fault of wastefulness can
be added that of implausibilityi
Singer happens to move into a
jeweler’s house (Singer does
jewelry work); the drunken drifter
happens to play chess (Singer
plays chess); and the same
drunken drifter happens to be
around when the knife fight
breaks out.

Small difficulties like these can
ruin a film: the feeling of
contrivance is hard to dispel. And
contrivance it is. As the movie
grinds to a close and the
calamities pile up thick and fast.

One by one the escape hatches
shut with creaking finality, until
at the end all those characters
who haven‘t been maimed,
contracted cancer, or died a
horrible death wind up with
permanently crippling trauma.

Nothing wrong with a nihilistic
view of life, but “The Ileart is a
Lonely Hunter“ is faked nihilism,
an overt manipulation for bathetic
effect. In fact, one could call this
something of an exploitation film,
in that perhaps the assorted
deformities of tiie characters are
supposed to wheedle us into
accepting their implausible
sufferings.

To such as this Alan Arkin's
performanCe is a saving grace. Just
to watch his eyes throughout a
scene is to see a genuine gift at
work. And there are moments in
other performances, and now and
then a good detail in the staging.

But at its center the film seems
empty, When Singer commits
suicide (where did that gun come
from, anyway?) and the girl Mick
visits his grave, where there should
be pathos is nothing. As with so
much in this movie one is left
finally in uneasy disappointment.

Theatre Season Tomorrow

A national touring company
will perform “America Hurrah” at
8:30, October 12 in Page Hall. In
sponsoring this production,
Dramatics Council of the State
University of New York at Albany
will raise the curtain of the
1968-1969 season at the State
University Theatre.

“America Hurrah", Jean-Claude
van Itallie's satire is one of two
guest artist performances to be
offered this year by Dramatics
Council. A second artist or group,
not yet announced, is planned for
the spring semester.

Playing off-Broadway for
eighteen months, “America
Hurrah”, blazed the trail for much
of the current exciting theatre on
Broadway today. Van Itallie
portrays various factes of
contemporary American society.
The three one act plays which
make up “America Hurrah”
present a timely reflection of
current trends toward
anonyminity and violence.

New TV Network
May Hit Waves

NEW YORK (UPI) ‘ Me-
tromedia Inc, and the Trans-
america Corp, announced joint-
ly today agreement in principle
to merge, giving rise to
speculation of establishment of
a fourth television network.

John W, Kluge, chairman of
the board and president of
Metromedia, said at a news
conference “the joint resources
of both organizations could
provide Mctromedia the capabi-
lity for an alternative program

service for television stations
lacking network affiliations."
Kluge, as well as John R.

Beckett, president and chief
executive officer of ’I‘ransameri-
ca, who also was present at the
news conference, declined to
elaborate on the statement.
Both men, however, would not
deny the possibility that a
fourth network could be creat-
oil.

Kluge told the nch confer
once, held at Metromedia
offices, the Federal Communi-
cations Uonnnission would llﬂVl‘
to approve the merger before it
would also have to give their
approval, he said.

Features

Superb New Exhibits

by Paula Carmadella

The exhibit now showing at the
Art Gallery is really superb.
Featured are the works of Rafael
Villamil, a Pucrto Rican painter,
Donald Ogier.

Both Villamil and Ogier
interpret the world
pessimistically, and they both deal
with social injustices, individual
failures, and war and sex as
destructive forces. But their
manners of presentation are
completely different, which
makes the entire exhibit
refreshing and exquisite,

Donald Ogicr, working with
“three dimensional painting,"
enhances the communicative
possibilities of his works because
he involves the onlooker by
making him participate physically
in appreciating the creation.

He uses a combination of found
objects, canvas and wood tt
convey his message, and he also
eliminates the “look but don‘t
touch" attitude about observing
paintings, Instead, he makes the

sense of touch a compulsory
element in the observation
process

Sliding wood panels, and

hinged doors make for perfect
communion of thought between
the artisl and onlooker. “Romeo
and Juliet“ is thr- niost ingenious
of his 1:! paintings, whereby he
uses the frame of an automobile
Wlllt‘ll has doors to open to rchal
the meaning of the creation.
Villamil, on the other hand,

uses harsher art forms to

with

Theodore ilkoll

communicate a harsher message
about his world. Instead of using
rich canvas, acrylics and wood
textures, he jabs the onlooker
with aluminum, plastic, morror
chips, distorted pictures, and
flashing lights.

“is creations usually deal with
the gruesome irony of the horrors
of war against a peace loving
nation and the hypocritic religious
sentiment of “love thy neighbor."
I'le introduces such an idea in
“The Last of the Great Lovers."
and “Yes, it Was Not Sad, But , .

Villamil uses mirror chips to
reflect the onlooker, so that he,

too, is distorch and grotesquely
out of propo .iun. lle juxtaposes
bloody scenes with silver
decorative elements to add a
cynical, sadistic enjoyment of the
scene of horror.

There is no solace or hope
whatsoever offered by the
paintings of Villamil as llt‘
audacioust reveals the glaring
facts of social hypocricy, abuses
of sex, and horrors of war.

()git-r manages to incorporate a
less cynical titilliiok about the
same situations by the use of a
t‘hrist figure in many of his
paintings, which adds a dimension
of compassion for human
shortcomings.

IIolh artists make lheir points
on different emotional IeVi-Is.

This particularly fine exhibit
will run until October l.'l.

GRAND PRIX PROVIDES RACY EXCITEMENT

By Paul Marin

Human nature is plagued by a
somewhat large number of
frailties. At this time of year,
certain of these behavioral
weaknesses become more rtahn
readily apparent amongst the
people who are members of the
Grand Prix racing elite.

October brings the penultimate
events of the racing season and
when the Grand Prix circus aliglits
upon Watkins Glen, a sleepy
hollow in upstate New York, for
the US. GP, very few racing
people are in an amiable mood.
There are several reasons for this:
1) Since Everyone cannot be first
all the time, there are many losers
at a season's fini. 11) Beginning in
May, or earlier, the world’s
greates’ racing competitors Iiave
had tlir r nerves chewed and
ravaged by hordes of autograph
seekers, by rounds of testimonial
dinners, by inane public relations
appearances, by cocktail party
gush, by living out ofa suit-rise in
Europe‘s seedy hotels, by stupid
quesitons put by dialy newspaper
journalist and by a general lack of
privacy-because of this bother
and uproard a couple of drivers
have lost their wives this season,
among other things. 3) The first
two reasons for crumby behavior
amongst racing people are
exacerbated by the fact that the
Glen race is prevaded by an
atmosphere of clandestine
intrigue, Machiavellian political
chicanery, and a general scent of
subterfuge. This atmosphere issues
from a great deal of intra~and
inter-team bickering about who is
going to get what contract for
which car next year. Meanwhile,
drivers, team owners, managers,
and wives are all busy casting
aspersions upon one another for
past mistakes and grievances-the
cold chill of error has everyone on
edge. Four letter word expletivcs
are used in abudance to describe
another man's personality or car
or both. Amid all this
bumbolt and yellow stink of
treachery there was a race on.
Twenty-three of the world ’s most.

racecraft, each effulgcnt with a
kind of tawny pride, each

incredibly erotoic, vulpine, full of
harnessed anger, turned up to do

Friday practice was held from
one to five pee M, and Saturday's
from 12-4. The weather both days
was frightful. Smoky colored
lachrymose skies hovered over the
lion‘s autumnal purlieus. Bouts
of rain on Friday afternoon
fouled up fuel mixtures and what
not and croos-winds played havoc
with the newly instituted wings
that all Formula I cars sprouted
this season.

Scuderia Ferrari ficldetl three
cars, one each for Chris Anion
(New anland and Derek Bell
(England). The third was a
muletta car for the boys in play
with at their whim, Anion
moiiki-yi-(l arouan \vitli fuel
blends and the new Y~l2
Firestone rain tires. Bell’s car was
kind of an old nail, If: months of
age, and hence not Very
competitive. This was the
Englishman‘s second Grand Prix
(his first w ltaly) and it is
obvious he hasn’t been around (ll’
racing long. Being naive, he's hot
to have any titwit journalist ask
him sum sudsy question or give an
autograph. He'll get over tlial
right quick, if he‘s around racing
at all long. Amon got to work and
turned a 1:04.25 lap. 'l‘he Kiwi
has turned up the wick this season
and is long overdue for A Grand
Pix victory. (Treasc (as team
manager Forghieri calls him in his
gumbo English) is a terribly
wistful chap and really too nice a
guy to be a racing driver.

Vic Elford and Lucien Bianchi

cars were not competitive. The
engines (\’-12s) have l.wo«valvc

four, and Elford could only
account for this engineering

“l’olitics, my mon, politics", Vic
reckoned he‘d quit racing and go
to the World Series if the weather
didn’t clear up,

slave and Indy 500 winner Bobby
