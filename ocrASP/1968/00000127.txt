ALPHA LAMBDA CHI has proven to be the team to beat thus far in

League II competition.

ALC Heads

League II

EEP Commands Three

by Tom Libbos

As it seems in AMIA, defense is
the key influence, and leagues 2
and 3 illustrate this fact very well.

The leader in league 2,
surprisingly enough, has only
scored twice in two games, while
the highest score in the same
league has been under twenty.

League 3, which is hampered
this year by a lack of team
membership is struggling with
only four teams, but still has shoe
wed a great deal of spirit and
individual effort.

At this point,AI..C is off to a
fine start and their record is 2-0
which leads league 2. This year,
ALC has combined all their talent
into what seems a trophy winning
team. Depending mostly on their
very strong defense, ALC has been
tough thus far - they have shut
out both the Raiders and TXO by
a score of 7-0.

On offense, ALC is cpatained
by quarterback Jerry Calvario,
who intercepted a pass and sped
for a touchdown against the
Raisers and passed to Steve Shear
for a score agains TXO.

State Quad and Waterbury A
opened their season with State
winning 12-2. It has been their

only games but a substantial
amount of abillity was revealed on
both sides State’s

quarterback,.lim Cavanaugli,
proved very effective, and
Waterbury‘s captain Paul
Smalheiser also did a fine job.

The Raiders led by the
Cudmore Brothers Dave and
Rog, showed good scoring ability

Middlebury

agaisnt APA where they
overpowered the good guys by a
score of 19-0. Their record is 1-1.

TXO, captained by Gary
Simser, is even on the year at 1-1.
They could very well be a threat
as they improve with each game.

In league8, Potter Club has
again illustrated a seemingly
overpowering team. With such
impressive individual efforts of
Kevin Sheehaii and Charlie Stamp.
the Club has compiled a 2-0
record by defeating STB and State
by scores of 12-0 and 13-6
respectively.

In other league 3 action,the
Huns scored a forfeit over State.

  
 

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

STB Mauls Waterbury 34-0;

Tappan

y Jeffrey Saperstem .
Two teams emerged this week victorious in League I intramural action. and both must be conSidcrcd

champion contenders.

Defeats Potter 7-0

On Monday, Tappan upset the Potters 7-0. State Quad is now Z-l and this game proved that they have

jellcd into a competent and cohesive football team.

Both teams were unable to mount steady drives in the scoreless first half.

Tappan broke the ice in the
second half, when quarterback
Cass Galka threw a pretty pass
into the flat to George Margan.
Margan did a little ballet so as not
to step out of bounds and ﬁnished
it off with a dive into the end
zone. He then kicked the extra
point. for Tappan‘s 7-0 victory

Both Jim Somnicrvillc and
Royce Van Evcra played fun:
games for the Tappanitcs.

The ﬁrst routing of the season
took place Tuesday afternoon,
and it was another shutout. STB,
with probany the finest set of
receivers in the league. also got
great performances from
quarterback Larry Myers and both
lines. They dominated action over
Waterbury through the entire
game.

The first time STB got the ball,
(after a partially blocked kick)
Myers rolled right and threw a
touchdown pass to Tom Sears.
Myers used this roll out pattern
quite effectively, often choosing
to run power sweeps to balance
his passing game. One of these
sweeps was good for STB’s second
touchdown.

An interference call set up
STB’s third touchdown. Myeri
threw a long pass to Tom Nixon
and the first half ended, 19-0.

The great pursuit by STB’s
defense, especiallly Al Herzlich,
caused Waterbury quarterback
Monte, to fumble in the end zone.
for a safety. A long pass to Tom
Sears led to Mike Pavy's first t.d.
He also caught one to finish the
scoring at 34-0.

Jim Healv plaved a great game,
making a beautiful onehanded
grab. Pavy and sears were stars,
along with defensive halfback
Mike Golub.

The team placed fourth among
the ten teams competing. Last

race as Larry Frederieks
established a meet record of14.30
for the 2.8 mile course.

The fresh barriers placed two
men in the top ten of the ﬁfty
runners competing. They could
not, however, manage enough
points to challenge the ultimate
winners, Buffalo State.

In addition to losing to Buffalo,
Albany also was outpointed by
Cortland State iind Alfred
University.

Top runner for Albany was
I’uul Holmes who finished fourth
with a time of 15:47. Dennis
l'lnckett was only two seconds
behind Paul, yet finished in sixth.
The next finisher for Albany was
Lou Wittig who placed
twenty-second.

The other three runners who
finished for Albany were I‘aul

Coach Munsey commented that
the runners were hampered in
their performance by a heavy
downpour which made the course
very slow and muddy.

Mr. Munsey also went to say
that be particularly impressed by
the performances turned in by
Holmes and Hackett.

The ﬁnal standings in the race
read as follows: Buffalo State, 36;

StudentsForHumphrey
Discuss Political Issues

,, ,by Barbara Duncan
For our own safety we should

support Hubert Humphrey. We
have to have a longer memory
than the past four years." With
these words M.J. Rosenberg
addressed the rally last Thursday
evening held in support of the
election of Hubert Humphrey.
Commenting on the small
turnout of students, Rosenberg
remarked, “The leftist students
are maintaining ii neutrality at a
time when there is a great moral
issue. It takes more courage to
stand up for Humphrey thanit did

Science and mathematics
majors with a DEFINITE interest
in this profession may also be
nominated. If United States
citizens, they must apply
simultaneously for a National
Science Foundation Fellowship.

Anyone who feels he qualifies
for the nomination and wishes
further information should see his

discussed the reasons for
supporting the Democratic
nominee. They cited Humphrey’s
strong civil rights stand, feeling
that he knows the problems and
understands the black pride.

Humphrey was likened to FDR
in that he is a progressive. He has
supported such liberal legislation
as Medicare, Food for Peace and
the Peace Corps.

On the question of civil
disobedience, Rosenberg
remarked, “Nixon supports law
and order, but Humphrey favors

   
 

for Bobby Kennedy or Gene law and order plus iustice.
McCarthy." When asked how he proposed
Those present at the “my to get the young people interested
‘ ' v . ~ . in the campaign, Rosenberg
V stated, “We must trust in the

college students and realize they
will make the right decision."

“Nixon’s appeal is to the old
line conservative; the people who
are afraid of the I)lthlta "

“But I have faith iii the
American people, they're not a
bunch of bigois. They have no
desire to turn the clock back."

On the question of Senator
Muskie’s qualifications, Rosenberg
remarked. “Thirty three percent
of our Presidents buva died in
office. The voter is forced to
seriously consider the Vice
Presidential candidate. Muskie is
articulate and the students can
relate to him. He also has the
McCarthy image."

However, they realize the
obstacles which confront them.
According to Rosenberg, “We
must talk to people; we cannot
sell out America."
