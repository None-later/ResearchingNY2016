A SCENE FROM “America Hurrah." The play shocked and absorbed
Fromm Foundation Award in its audience.

‘The Happenings9 And Bike]:
A Worthwhile Experience

by Alan Laslrar

Wine improves with time... and
so do concerts. In contrast to the
previous University concert, The
Homecoming Concert, sponsored
by The Council for Contemporary
Music, featured Theodore Bikel
and “The Happenings,“ combined
vitality and originality with
humor to result in a performance
that proved well worth witnessing.

Bikel commenced his
performance by assuring the
audience that he would sing a
beautiful song. “What do you
think l'm going to sing to you, an
ugly song?"

Bplaining to the audience that
folksinging is work, he requested
that the audience participate in
his following selection. The mild
response that he received at ﬁrst
was immediately overcome by a
sudden explosion of audience
participation. Why? “The little
kids at Newport do better than
that." Believe me. improvement
shined forth from that moment
on,

Bikel's selections included “A
Spanish Love Song“-- a soft sweet

meledy that the audience
accepted quite warmly, "Speak to
me With Flowers”-- a mood
producing chant, and "Hard
Times"--the core of today's
society.

Bikel entertained the audiencr.I
in a political light. “We shall not
be moved" transformed into “Mr,
Daly shall be removed". Also.
Bikel summized Reagan and
Goldwater.

Bikel concluded his uttributaoie
performance by two antivwar
songs: “Two Brothers" and “A
Hundred .\lcn." Before retiring
from the platform, Bikel delivered
a stimulating parable' “The
Parable of the Burning House".
The important thing to do is not
to ask questions only, but to act ,
before it's too late. By now. the
Wine was superb. but the flavor

was soon to sour before final
improvement.
An unorganized intermission

prcceeded the 'lIiippenings." No
one was designated to the
overhead Iights--lience the
proceedings were held in almost
complete darkness, aside from the
spotlight. The soccer and cross
country teams were introduced to
the audience, The value and
necessity pertaining to these
introductions are questionable.
Besides being time consuming, it
was clearly evident no one much
cared. as a constant buzzing of

voices clamored through the
affair.
The announcement of the

Homecoming Queen was ii farce.
llcsidcs only requiring two
minutes. the hurriedness of the
affair ruined any importance or
significancc ll could have had
upon thi- audience

Finally tlic lights came on...

and remained on. The
“Happenings” would not be
introduced until the lights were
lowered which required five
minutes. Disgusted and impatient

describe the audience at this
point. However, these feelings
were soon to change.

“The Happenings" selections

ranged from soul to rock and song
to ballad. “Get Ready," their
opening number, preceded an
early hit, “Go Away Little Girl.“

To spice the ﬂavor of their
performance even more,
impersonations of fellow actors
and singers followed; Johnny
Mathis, Dean Martin, Bob Dylan.
Ed Sullivan, The Beach Boys, The
Four Season, and the Rolling
Stones.

“See you in September.“ “You
Lost that Loving Feeling,"
“Dancing in the Streets,“ and
"Yesterday" were just a few of
their special numbers. Their
concluding song was “I‘ve Got
Rhythm," and believe me, that‘s
exactly what they have,

Their encore selectiOn ended
with “Mammy” and "Exodus."
The clamor of applause was a
good indication that the audience
was thoroughly satisfied with the
“Happenings” and the concert as
awhole.

Leaving the gymnasium, I heard
such general comments regarding
the performance as “great,” and
“The best since the Tops," and
“The best one yet!"

‘AmericaHurrah’:

Absorbing Play

by Gary Gelt
Jean-Claude Van ltallic‘s
Amt’ri'cn Hurrah, which played to
a packed Page Hall on Saturday,
October 12, is a brilliantly
conceived work of art. The play

consists of three short onc-iicl
plays laden With symbolism.
nevertheless they provulc an

entertaining evening becausi- oric
cant help but be absolutlcy
fascinated by what Van ltiillii- is
saying and his actors are doing .

The first play, “Interview,” is
quite similar to ll nightmarish
Rowan and Martin Laugh-In party
with each actor mechanically
reciting his lines followed by the
entire cast dancing to some wild
music, in this case “Turkey in The
Straw." Van Itallie is subtley, but
not too subtley because he
doesn't want to lose his audience
yet, pointing out the mechanistic
and dehumanized aspects of life.

The author has his characters
speak while no one pays the
slightest attention to them. Each
character, possessing no name to
further indicate the mechanism of
life, often speaks to himself rather
than another person who is not
listening. Van Itallie achieves his
“Sounds of Silence" theme with
little “pieces” performed by all
the characters. The standout
segment is that of a smiling
governor, perched on a soap box.
The governor merely smiles at the
people saying as little as possible,
The rest of the cast huddlcs
together making crowd noises,
sounding like 200 people rather
than seven.

The acting is uniformly
excellent, partly because these
people believe in what they are
saying and therefore trying to
convey the message to the

audience as well as they can.

POP-eyed World

by John DeMarcc

 

“The Times They Are
A'Changin'." (B. Dylan) Dylan‘s
words of yesteryear still hold: the
times are changing-the problem is
that people don't seem to change
with the times, Such has been case
in the realm of pop-music (here
defined as rock, blues, folk, and
any combination or variation of
the three). It is truly amazing to
find a university community,
which searches for meaning and
value in academic affairs, so
unconcerned in its consideration
of the pop-music phenomenon.
The seemingly awar , alert. and
curious university student has
been brainwashed. for the most
part, by commcrical jackasses who
know as much about what is going
on in muSic as they know about
Wrigley's gum, or some other
product they advertise.

The purpose of this column Will
not be to offend anyone, but i
think it should be made clear. in
this, the first column, that
concern for Top In sclilock-rock
will be rid], Granted, occasionally
the radiomations break through
with something of value. but so
does George Wulllace. My concern
is for the establishment of a new
outlook on the pop scene. It has
changed greatly, and continues to
change constantly. Pop-music is
no longer just a garbage collection
of worn'out pictures and
propaganda of overnight
sensations. In its deepest and most
serious aspects, pop has come a
long way. To discowr how far it
has come, "you must take away
the rug from you eyes," (Dylan)
and look a little further than top
40 and teen scene. Anything
Worthwhile to our growth as a
person is usually not easily found.

The inner-circle of pop-music

cries for recognition, but like so
many things of possible value in
our society, is passed by. From
the dim-lit COffOE'J()LlSO to the
giant concert hall; from the quaint
sound of a banjo to the
electrifying experience of an
amplified guitar; from the simple
lyrics of the blues to the complex
voices of musical poets-these
contrasts can all be made in
pop-music, making it. again, in its
serious aspects, ii fascinating
world. Through this column I
hope to bring as much of it into
the open as possible, Join in the
search for something new and
different. til might even be ten
yrs. old but maybe you've just
never discovered Ill. Open your
minds. your cars. and your arms,
and grab onto "your own bag."
