To the Editor:

This letter is written in the
hope that the Chairman of the
Student Tax Committee, Terry
Mathias, will loosen at least one of
the clamps that has been imposed
upon ticket sellers.

Let me preface my remarks by
stating that i am a firm believer in
Student Tax and feel that,
manditory or not. each student
should feel obligated to support
campus organizations by paying
Student Tax. Money saved on'
events throughout the year is
another reason why Student Tax
is worthwhile. And i am glad to
ser that the savings this year are
rel tarkably greater titan any other
ye. r. Let those who have not felt
it to be their duty to pay the tax

maintain the tnost basic of its
services. The percentage if
students stipportitlg the services
and functions of the government
would be smaller than it is now.

The student who is unwilling to
pay it fee to support the
government tries to ignore the
that

fact that government

represents him on faculty

committees alld consultations

But, Mr. Mathias. if i atn taking

paid her tax assessment, why must
i not only borrow her tax card.
but her student 10 also? i can see
the reason why her tax card is

When the number on the tax

why the need of the [D also? Who

Men have always. and will
always, devise and revise new
language forms in order to convey
ideas in intelligible and
meaningful terms.

The scholar, it is said. is a man
also; and his peculiar position as
the Knower of Many Things
causes him to search for new ways
of expression.

As a result, when the student is
confronted by the Knower, he
finds himself in a wonderland of
new words which. allegedly. mean
a great deal.

Frequently

cotter-pl urtlism.
and l‘trtlctiotlalism.

With this new plethora of
“isms.” the Knower and student
carry on dialogues in which
neither side understands the
other, but in which neither knows
that he doesn't know and if he (lid
he wouldn’t know why.

Thus lsmatic language. to coin
a new word, is a way of lumping a
lot of unknowns into one
supposedly known ism-word.

Such being the case. “Ism's”
shall hereafter be the title of this
column. because no one here
kiloWs what he‘s talking about
either.

lsmatism, however. earl be a lot
of fun besides a lot of nothing.
What follows is an example. as the
politics of 1968 are explained in
terms of negativism, an ism word
itself,

Negativism is displayed in
Nixonism. a typical type of
Republicanism irl which
conservatism is molded tnto
moderationism. Nixon is negative
about llumphreylsm, Wallactstll.
extremism. itlternrtttonal
communism, and collectivistll.

Of course. he has his
l'avoritisms too. favoritism being
one of them, itldustriitlism
another. and Nixonisnl another.
All in all though, his is the politics
of cynicism. for he is cynical
about Johtlsonism. socialism.
realism, and debating.

Senate candidate l’ztul ()‘Dwyct
said Monday the next president
should fire Selective Service Di-

”l would eliminate the whole

cratic candidate told all audi-
ence of about i,ti()() students at
Cornell University's Bailey llall.

He also said "People have it
right to express a moral or ittl

a particular war.”

O'Dwyer called for a Depart
ment of Peace because “the
department of war has only got
us in trouble."

O'Dwyor concentrated his cam-
paign during the day in central

Wallace is peculiar in that his
negativism extends to just about

pays for most activities which
make up our extra-curricular life.

Some students have questioned
the validity of these activities. The
discerning student, however, will
see that these activities provide a
much needed intellectual and
social environment—that the

Why the “with honor" bit
when people discuss the
possibilities of withdrawal of our
military commitment in Vietnam?
Is it merely a strive for blind
American pride? Quite possibly,
however not necessarily.

Whether or not the United
States was justified in
participating in it Southeast Asian
war is now immaterial. The point
is that we are there. Tile question
is how do we get out,

Assuming that there is ample
subject matter for innumerable
movies, 1 shall [ﬁrstulate that the

American public. in general. wants
to get out of Vietnam

A conventional military
solution seems impossible at
present, and atomic weapons

unreasonable. So, let there be
peace. But ltow‘!

Apparantly we can have peace
with or without honor, and
not with both or neither. leaving
us the first two choices. The
initial question we must ask
ourselves s wilth ramifications
peace without honor (Le.
immediate withdrawal of troops)
would bestow upon us.

Wilt-ll that fort-e grows strong,

thereby in advance to stifle the
entire process of education.

The question of when to stop
dissent is left to the police, and as
long as they are ready to serve
their purpose-"at the gate, down
the street, or ill the country-the
university, the student, and
education itself is not free.

The immediate effect would be
communiarttion and perhaps
slaughter of the South

But we must look beyond the
immediate effects.

Unfortunate as it may appear.
there is a remarkable correlation
betWeen the words peace and fear.
Peace is not inspired by love and
understanding as many of our
idealistic friends would have us
believe.

it would be gratifying if that
were the case, but ill world affairs
we must be fact-seeking,

So, ill essence. the choice is

students.

If the entire student body took
this attitude, no activities would
occur; for our tax makes them
possible. Without guaranteed
funds. Student Association cannot
forecast and appraise forthcoming
budgets.

Resulting extimates are usually
conservative. creating fewer
activities and often lower quality
in those held.

The anti-tax student benefits
from the ASP, WSUA, and other
functions funded by taxes. This is
not only l'reelortding. but creates
an inequity for those who pay
their tax.

We must not forget that
\l'ulnt‘lll of students who clainl
tilt-y l‘l't't‘lYt' iioilltttg from student
tax.

Unfortunately all we can
surmise from such remarks is that
the role of these students
(excluding those who must work
or who live at an inconvenient
distance) is comparable to the role
of the parasite.

They usurp the minimum
through non-participation (and
nonpayment) and contribute
nothing to a higher intellectual
atmosphere.

The right to be apathetic, to be
self‘centered and selfvrighteous

while withdrawing from the
University community cannot be
denied: every student has the

right to be a nurd as long as his
actions do not injure the rest of
the community.

in this case. non-payment and
non-participation are detrimental
to a potentially vibrant
community. The parasite drains.

Our present policy allowing
67% of the student body to
support the other 33% is unfair.
For those who pay. there are
fewer activities resulting from the
other students' eallousness.

Student Association cannot
function efficiently with severe
annual budgetary fluctuations.
The imposition of it mandatory
tax based on the same premise as
the State tax—since all benefit, all
pay is needed at tilis time,

The viable cornmuntty compels
its members to be responsible for
its welfare.
