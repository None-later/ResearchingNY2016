Krosby said that he would look at

before considering an increase in

The new chairman stated that D
professors should teach as much
as possible, but only the material
they are interested in. Krosby
contended that the “structure of
present course offerings was
created for an earlier period of
time." Continuing, he said that a
need for a change throughout the
country has been brought about
by the change of time as well as a
change in students. “Students
now want courses that are
relevant to today."

When asked about the
student-teacher ratio in history
classes be firmly answered that
the ratio is very poor.

Expanding on this, Krosby
stated that more money is
necessary before the University B
may obtain more teachers to cut U
down this ratio.

The overall impression that
Krosby has of Ihl‘ history

department having an Excellent

on contempt charges for ignor-

for 15 days a year ago when the
union struck in a contract

Teachers are forbidden to
strike by the state‘s Taylor Law

Troy Slum Aide Held

by Barbara Epstein

Faith Evans, a civil rights
worker in Troy, was convicted
September 24 and sentenced two
days later to six months in
Rensselaer County Jail on charges
of obstructing government
administration.

According to Evans, “I was not
convicted on the evidence. It was
purely a matter of police uniforms
versus a black man."

The charge was filed by
Detective Michael Pastorc, who
said Evans got in his way while he
tried to book three youths in the
Troy police headquarters on June
27

Evans saw Detective Pasture
and another policeman dispersing
a group of teenagers on Sixth
Street that evening.

When he saw some of the boys
being placed in a patrol car, he is
alleged to have asked Pasture what
was happening, and a scuffle
occured between the two of them.

Evans then walked to the
station to lodge a complaint
against Pcatore. Pastore has also
been the subject of various
complaints by white residents of
the city.

The detective stated that Evans
pushed him aside slightly and
started to go toward the boys.

According to the “New York
Times," October 1, Evans claimed
that the detective clubbed him,
tore his shirt in the station, and
was throwing him bodily out
when a sergeant suggested that he
should be locked up.

lnitially Evans was refused bail
on grounds that his record had to
be looked up. On June Ill), three
days after the arrest, more than
IOU persons led by the Troy
NAACP marched to the policth

without bail on a minor charge is
a threat to civil liberties."

Finally Judge Timothy Fogarty
placed the bail at $1,000.
Presently, the case is being
appealed.

Raised in Brooklyn‘s
Bedford-Stuyvesant section, Evans
came to Troy on parole from
prison. He had served almost five
years on a sentence of a robbery
charge of which he was later
cleared.

Evans pleaded guilty because he
said he had been promised a
suspended sentence and he was “a
young kid who didn‘t know what
was going on" (he Was Iii at the
time).

After a probation violation, his
sentence was reinstated. When the
case was reviewed, the judge said
there was strong indication that
Evans was innocent.

Delivers

by Jane D'Amico

Dr. J. Lawrence Katz. Liberal
Party candidate for the 29th
Congressional District appeared
on campus Thursday. October IO.
Dr. Katz. in a lecture sponsored
by the Forum on Politics.
expressed his views on “pressing
issues" on the local. national, and
international levels.

lititz. Professor of Physics, at
chssclaer Polytechnic Institute.
has been active in politics for the
past five years as “a concerned
citizen."

Katz, who has received support
from the black conimunilv. called
for an “immediate attempt to
bring the poverty-stricken portion
of our country into the national
economy." by supporting the
development of industries in order
to provide jobs, increased
purchasing power and added tax
revenues for needed civic
improvement.

He stated the need for
elimination of segregation in
education. housing and
employment, and other inequities
in keeping with such reasonable
programs as the NAACP 67
points.

Locally, Katz advocates the
establishment of “public forums
in which citizens can directly
participate in the decision-making

Policy

processes of government," and the
establishment of the office of
public ombudsman.

In an attempt to intensify
urban renewal be emphasized low
cost public transportation in order
to revitalize our cities

On the national scene. Katz
supported the lowering of the
Ivoting age to 18.

He would eliminate the present
draft system. advocating the
operation of a professional army
during peacetime and the
establishment of a limited lottery
system during time of war.

The candidate would like to
"return the choosing of national
candidates to the citizenry by an
open national primary."

Speech

The replacement of the
"present obsolete welfare systen‘

by a guaranteed annual income
and guaranteed employment” was

also suggested. Other programs he
mentioned were the Initiation of
effective gun registration
legislation and consumer
protection legislation.

Katz sees ii need for the
revitalization of our foreign policy
“with regard to the needs and
aspirations of the emerging
nationalistic spirit within the
society of nations," and therefore
advocates the recognition and
admission of mainland China into
the UN.
