The sporting events for this year's Homecoming Weekend provided
both excitement and frustration. Whereas the soccer team displayed
one of their worst showings of the year, the cross-country squad turned
in their most impressive victory of the season.

In past years, much criticism has been raised over the quality of
teams scheduled for the soccer game for Homecoming. This year,
however, Coach Schicffelin made sure that no objections could be
raised as to the capabilities of his team's opponent. Middlebury,
although not overpowering. at least has the claim of having toured
Europe for a twenty game schedule.

While the soccer team has not been successful in winning games so
far this year, they have displayed a potential for scoring and a fairly
solid defense. Both. however, seemed to be missing on Saturday.
Middlebury's first goal resulted from some sloppy defense and their
second might have been averted if the Albany fullbacks had been more
effective in clearing the ball from in front of the goal.

In the first half, Albany's offense looked especially ineffective as
they were unable to build up any kind of threat against the Middlebury
defense.

Coach Schicffelin made an attempt to instill some kind of spark into
his squad in the second half as he juggled his lineup in search for
someone to lead an attack. “is efforts were in vain, hrIWever, as tiie
booters just could not come up with an effective attack.

The cross-country team, on the other hand, displayed one of their
most impressive victories ever in their close win over Boston State. in
this closely run race, the overall team effort was superb as each of the
first five finishers was required to make a strong finish in order to
record the victory.

Don Beevers turned in an exceptionally fine performance as he
passed a Boston State runner in front of him as if the Boston man were
standing still. Pat Gepfert also came on in the final portion of the race
to pass a Boston runner. If these two had not passed the men in front

of them, the outcome of the race would have been reversed.

 

So far this year, League 1 in AMiA football has provided some
exciting games as every team but APA has either lost or tied at least one
game. lt‘is beginning to look as though the APA men are definitely the
team to beat as they have rolled up ﬁfty-seven points in only two games

and have not yet been scored upon.

Meet To Cobleskill

hv TONY Cantove

The freshman cross country
team record now stands even at
two victories against two defeats.
They have triumphs over
Adirondack Community College
and Siena whilc bowing to RH
and Cohleskiii Community
College.

Their latest meet was at
Cobicskill on October ll, where
they were defeated by an
outstanding team which was much
superior in depth. As evidenced
by the fact that Cohlcskiil placed
four out of the first five runners.

(in October it. they
participated in a triangular mot-t
with host Siena. 'i‘licy easily
defeated Sicna but a lack of depth
was also a handicap to them
against ltl’l as it has been
throughout the season. Despite
the fact tlicy placed three of the
first six they could not nail down
a victory.

The Albany State team has
been anchored all year by the
outstanding performance of
Dennis I‘Iﬂckctt. lie placed first
both at Sicna and Cobieskill. At
Sicnu, although relinquishing the
lead several times but regaining it
permanently with a burst of speed
in the final int) yeards, he covered
the (Lil niiic course in the
excellent time of iii minutes and

58 seconds in finishing first.

At Cobleskiil he exceeded his
previous outstanding
performances by establishing a
track record for the 3.2 mile
course of 16 minutes and 16
seconds erasing the old mark by
one second.

Albany State has also received
good performances from Paul
Holmes who placed fifth at Siena
and sixth at Cobleskiil and Lou
Wittig who placed sixth at Sienu
and eighth at Cohieskill,

The next start for the Keith
Munsey coached freshman team is
al home on (ll'l.()l)cr iii, against
New l‘alt‘L.

The frosh hooters were
completely overpowered as they
were overwhelmed from the
outset by the Mohawk offense.

Two Mohawk players combined
for six of the eight goals as Paul
Rims and Rick Small each tallied
three goals.

The lone goal for Alany was
scored by Larry Baumann.

The Jim Handzel—coached team
has yet to score a victory this
season as their inexperienced team
has failed to generate a real
scoring threat against any of their
opponents thus far.

Albany's record now stands at
no wins and three losses for the
season. Their next watch is
scheduled for Thursday when
they play host to a tough team
from neighboring itPi.

The game starts at 4:00 and
Coach l’lundzcl is looking for
some support for his dcvuloping
team.

Council Discusses Mandatory Tax
Students To Vote In Referendum

by Kathy Harem-n

"i challenge the student body
to become informed on the
subject of student tax so that they
can make a sound judgment. The
benefits are many-10 are the
responsibilities," said Vice
President of Central Council and
Chairman of the Student Tax
Committee, Terry Mathias.

The referendum on Student
Fees is as follows:

“With the increased outcry by
the student body for bigger,
better, and more activities, of
recreational, social, and
educational nature there is
increased financial need.

“in order that the Student
Association may come closer to
meeting its ﬁnances. it hereby
refers the question of a
mandatory student fee to you, the
Student Body.

“Are you in favor of a
mandatory student fee'.’
Yes-“No.” On October 23, 24,
and 2f), the members of the
student body of the University
will have the opportunity to vote
on this proposed referendum,

Mathias said, “The question
should go to the entire student
body even though the government
is representative."

if the student votc supports a
mandatory fee, the new policy
will go into effect Spring
semester. There will be provisions
for exemptions for those with
extreme financial need.

All exemptions concerning
ﬁnancial matters will be handled

by the Financial Aids office.
Uther exemptions will be decided
by Student Association.

Student Tax Committee is also
trying to derive a policy for the
members of the student body who
have little use for the services
provided by the payment of the
fee.

A disadvantage of the
compulsory fee is that there are
people, not in need, who receive
little benefit from the privileges
granted them. According to
Mathias, this problem does not
affect a large segment of the
student body.

If the fee becomes mandatory,
and a student who is not
exempted does not pay, under a
resolution of the

 

Board of

Tru s tees, his grades and
transcripts can be withheld by the
Registrar.

A slight decrease in the student that the

The GI Rally is scheduled for
