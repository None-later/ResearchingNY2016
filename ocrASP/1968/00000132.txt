Jackie Kennedy Announces

Plans To

By FREDERICK M. WINSHIP

NEW YORK (UPI)—Mrs.
John F. Kennedy has found
romance after nearly five years
of widowhood and will marry
62-year-old Greek shipping bil-
lionaire Aristotle Socrates Onas-
sis, probably within a week, it
was announced Thursday.

The announcement made by
Mrs. Kennedy’s mother, Mrs.
Hugh D. Auchincloss of Wash-
ington and Newport came as a
surprise to all but a few of the
39-year-old former First Lady’s
intimates. For nearly a decade
Onassis, a divorcee, had been
linked to tempestuous opera
star Maria Callas, but their
idyll ended last summer.

Nancy Tuckerman, Mrs. Ken-
nedy’s secretary, said she was
uncertain about the date or the
place of the marriage but that

No ‘Eye’ Tonight,
Frankonis’ Play
For Next Week

The staff of the “Golden Eye”
coffeehouse announced the
cancellation of its program this
week due to the number of
important on-campus activities
going on simultaneously this
Friday night; the program
originally planned for tonight, a
talk on Ghana by a member of an
African study group, has been
postponed until next term,

The "Golden Eye," located at
820 Madison Avenue, has in the
past three weeks offered a folk
show, a series of underground
ﬁlms, and a Black Panthei
presentation; performances are
from 8:30 to 1 every Friday
night, and are usually free. The
“Eye” will return next week with
a play written and read by William
Frankonis of the faculty.

she thought it would occur
within the week rather than in
two or three weeks.

On An Island?

Another informed source said
the ceremony would be “on an
island somewhere.” Onassis
owns the Aegean island of
Skorpios.

The engagementlcame after
months of speculation over Mrs.
Kennedy's friendship with the
Earl of Harlech, British ambas-
sador to Washington during the
Kennedy Administration. WHile
Harlech was denying they were
anything but “devoted friends”,
Mrs. Kennedy‘s longtime friend-
ship with Onassis was deepen-
ing into love.

A source close to the family
said Mrs. Kennedy had pre-
pared her children, Caroline, 10,
and John Jr., 7, for the news.
Onassis, known to the family as
“Ari,” had spent two weekends
recently with his financee-to~be
and her children at Hyannis
Port, Mass.,to get to know the
children better. He has two
grown children by his first
marriage.

Mrs. Kennedy was first
entertained aboard Onassis' 325-
foot yacht, Christina, on a
Mediterranean cruise while she
was still First Lady. Onassis
was the first person outside the
family to visit her at the White
House after her return from
Dallas with her assassinated
husband's body in 1963.

Sources in Athens said Mme.
Callas decided to walk out of
Onassis' life after he invited
Mrs. Kennedy and Sen. Edward

Peace Talks
Bring About
New Hope

By United Press International
Reports swept the world
Thursday that Hanoi and
Washington were on the verage
of a compromise toward a
beginning of the end of the
Vietnam War. Diplomatic sour-
ces said South Vietnamese
objections were holding things
up.

Pham Dang Lam, Saigon's
head observer at the Paris
talks, emerged from more than
an hour with U.S. ambassador
at large W. Averell Harriman in
Paris Thursday. He looked
nervous and brushed aside
newsmen's questions.

Diplomatic sources and Paris
newspapers both said Saigon
refused to go along with a U.S.
plan to include South Vietnam
and the National Liberation
Front (NLF), the Viet Cong‘s
political branch, in the talks.

Diplomatic sources said the
United States offered to bring in
the NLF and the South
Vietnamese government and
order a total halt in the
bombing of North Vietnam.
Hanoi has steadfastly insisted
no progress could be made at
the talks until the bombing and
other acts of war stopped
without any strings attached.
The United States has always
said such a halt wuld have to be
accompanied by reciprocal
North Vietnamese moves tow-
ard peace.

Further developments:

--In Paris, the newspaper
F r a n c e-Soir said President
Johnson would already have
ordered the bombing stopped if
it had not been for Saigon's
renewal to aree to the idea. The
newspaper also said Saigon
objected to letting the NFL
enter the talks.

Pete Smits, President of
Interfraternity Council announced
last Thursday that the modified
Constitution, ratified in 1967 is
now ready to expand the role of
IFC. Upgrading the fraternity
movement ‘at the University is one
of the basic ideas of the Council.

“I think through the new
constitution," Smits commented,
“the fraternitites now have the
means with which they can take
positive steps forward. However,
this can only be done if
fraternities work together both as
individual groups and as a whole."

Speaking further, be said,
“R valry is good but the line has
to be drawn somewhere, and I
think the line should be drawn
during rush, In all other areas we
should all work together."

McCarthy Off NY Ballot,
Gives Boost To Humphrey

ALBANY, NY. (UPI) — Hu-
bert Humphrey’s presidential
bid received a major b o 0 at
Thursday when the New York
Court of Appeals ordered Sen.
Eugene McCarthy's name strick-
en from the state's November
ballot.

In a 7-0 decision, the high
court ruled that McCarthy could
not be run as the presidential
candidate of the splinter Coalir
tioii party against his wishes.

The Democratic party, fearing
that Humphrey would lose the
state's 43 electoral votes if Mc-
Carthy's name was on the balv
lot, initiated the action. McCar-
thy belatedly joined in the suit,

 

ballot," the court said in its
opinion.

"If the Democrats wanted to
ruin Nixon, all they would have
to do is put a separate slate
on the ballot pledged to General
Eisenhower or Governor Rocke-
feller," Goldberg said, “On the
other hand, if the Republicans
wanted Humphrey to lose they
could nominate a slate pledged
to Senator Kennedy and divide
the Democratic vote.”

Areas through which the IFC
hopes to complete its aims are the
individual, the individual
fraternity, and the fraternal
system as a whole. These concepts
are still being tested.

One of the ways to upgrade the
individual is through the award of
“Fraternity Man of the Month,"
as it is temporarily named. Each
fraternity nominates‘ one man per
month, the member whom his
fraternity feels has done the most
for himself, the group, the
University, and the community.

Each nominee is interviewed by
three faculty members iind four
rotating IFC members. Judged on
evaluations and interviepr the
winner receives a plaque and an
article about him will appear in
the ASP. At the end of the year a
“Fraternity Man of the Year" is
selected by the same procedure.

avoiding them. He gave: a

of experience of his opponent.

He drew a concerned response
from those present by backing up
charges that the Maﬁa is gaining
influence in the area of Albany.
Because of this threat, he strongly
urged a Grand Jury Investigation
of organized crime in theAlbany
area.

Proskin challenged his
opponent's lack of platform and
said that Mr. Scully would have to
come up with something better
than running on the experience
that he in all reality doesn't have.

Finally, he urged a Citizen
Advisory Board with
representatives from all sections
of the county to keep the District
Attorney informed of crime in
every part of Albany County. His
candidacy, in general, is trying to
present a serious threat to the
machine politics of the Albany
