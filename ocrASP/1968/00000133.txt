This November 5, the voting
citizens of this country will be
choosing one of 3 people to be
the next President of the United

States: Hubert Humphrey,
Richard Nixon, or George
Wallace.

It is true that one can support a
minor candidate, but it seems
such a candidate could only be
backed by those who sympathize
with the extremist.The platforms
of these minor contenders are so
narrow in their ideological views
that any set of these principles
could not be accepted by the
general American public.

Because of this non-acceptance.
the platforms of these candidates
are, in all practicality, worthless.

We are now faced with a
decision between Humphrey,
Nixon. or Wallace. We might wish
that there was another name on
the Democratic ticket, but there is
not. In reality, there is a vacuum
in this Presidential race, and no
candidate can fill it.

The former supporters of
Eugene McCarthy

their hope to gain any of the
principles they once fought for.
But, to remain within the system,
they must support Humphrey or
Nixon.

The greatest
McCarthyitc ideals
course, be the election of Wallace.
The election of Nixon would not
be as bad, but the chance of
McCarthy's philosophies surviving
the next four years would be nil.

The only hope that we have is
the hope in Humphrey.

The election of Wallace is all
but impossible. Yet, his
provincial, racist policies, such as
law and order with an emphasis
on order or the idea that local

the voters of the United States do
not want to hear their political

nominees say anything.

But, perhaps it is better that
Nixon does not give himself the
opportunity to blunder in side
comments since Ted Agnew has
illustrated his knack of insulting
the wrong people at the wrong
time.

Both men have records of being
political opportunists (Nixon
during the Red Hunting Days and
Agnew when he jumped on the
civil rights bandwaggon during his
gubernatorial campaign). With a
team like this in the White House,
what political principles of Gene
McCarthy could survive?

Even though McCarthy has not
yet endorsed Humphrey, the Vice
President poses the least threat to
the philosophies that were
espoused in New Hampshire.
Edmund Musky has much in
with the liberal
principles of the new Democratic
image, but he is the “lesser” half
of the ticket.

Humphrey, as a liberal in I948,
was the firebrand of the Senate.

During his years in Congress, he
was in part responsible for the
progressive legislation passed
there. such as the civil rights bills,
and the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
of 1963, and he was totally
responsible for the Peace Corps.

Many of his other projects, like
Medicare, have been passed under
the last administration.

It is under this administration,
though, where Humphrey has
been trapped. liven today, as a
Presidential candidate, he is
unable to divorce himself from
the policies of the Johnson
administration.

Yet, there is a historical proof
that Humphrey need not follow in
Johnson’s footsteps. That is, every
vice president, who took office
after his superior, placed his own
image on the new administration
and delegated his predecessor‘s
administration to history.

Out of 1968, there will arise a
new administration. We hope that
that administration will have a
new image, the image of the
- liberated Hubert Humphrey.

Reforms; .

To the Editor:

This letter is written in the
hope that the student body will
loosen its apathy and begin paying
attention to matters of
importance.

Let me preface my remarks by
stating that I, too, am a firm
believer in Student Tax and that I
too feel that each student should
feel obligated to support campus
organizations. I speak here as a
member of the student body,:iot
as Chairman of the Student Tax
Committee!

But, Mr. Fox and student body,
there is sound reasoning for
requiring the ID card, too. The ID
card represents the student’s
registration here at SUNYA. It
also is a means of cross-checking
student numbers, signatures. etc.,
so that it may be ascertained that
this student tax card has not been
tampered with. It is, to some
extent. an indication of the
second person's willingness to buy
a ticket-ie. that the card has not
been stolen. Note that I said "to
some extent." You raised a
question in your letter, Mr. Fox,
which ties directly to this. You
say, “who knows what else she'll
need her ID for? It is the kind of
card that must be on one‘s person
at all times." It is precisely this
reason that in the past, and now
during the present has prompted
Student Tax Committee to
require that the second person be

present also. This requirement
should have been effect for
whatever incident you have in

mind. If it wasn't, that was a
violation of the Student Tax
Policy and can lead to the freezing
of a budget!

I don’t believe that it is too
much to ask that both people be
present to buy tiekets--if you
think it is, I will be very happy to
discuss the situation.

To the Editor:

I have recently learned some
shocking facts about California
grape pickers. Some are: they are
not protected by health or
pension plans, they have no
unemployment insurance or
workmen's compensation, and
their school-age children are
forced to remain in the fields to
help support the family because
$1800 a year isn’t enough to live
on. These conditions have led the
grape pickers to strike to try to
obtain union recognition, which
would allow them to bargain with
the growers.

Their strike is being supportd
by a boycott of grapes, which has
been so successful in many large
cities that the growers are now
shipping their grapes to secondary
markets, such as Albany, NY. If
the boycott can be successful in
the secondary markets too,
perhaps the growers will give in
and allow the strikers such things
as a working day shorter titan
10—12 hours.

People who believe these
strikers should be supported have
planned a rally for Friday, Oct.
18, at 3:30 p.m. They have
invited anyone interested in
participating to come to the
Brothers‘ headquarters, 172 North
Pearl (1 block from the Palace
Theater). From there they will
walk to the Grand Union in the
new shopping center off South
Pearl. The hope is that, if the
crowd is large, there will be
enough news coverage to reach all

the grape consumers in the
Albanyarea.

I hope that faculty and
students from SUNYA will

consider the grape picker’s cause
worthy of their support.

There have been precious few
examples of national morality in
the twentieth or, for that matter,
any century. Certainly the years
1933-45 were marked by one
national crime after another.
Germany, as usual, set the pattern
and her neighbors followed suit.
Some acquiesced reluctantly like
Holland while many more like

Poland, joined the victorious
master eagerly.
The Soviets invaded Finland.

Great Britain abetted the Germans
by pursuing her standard selfish
imperialistic interests. The United
States waited for war to come to
her; when it (lid she slapped
thousands of her people into
concentration camps.

As Europe fell to the Germans,
so did its Jews. Each nation was
prompt in releasing its Jewish
citizens to the Nazis. 'l‘orlay
apologists for these countries ask
if they had any choice; who, they
ask, risked their own security to
help their fellow nationals.

Denmark '5 Courage

The people of Denmark fought
the Germans, and as long as there
is one free man on the planet, the
valor of the Danes should be
remembered. This week marks the
twenty-fifth anniversary of the
Danish rescue of all her Jewish
citizens.

It began with the German
occupation of Denmark in
August, 1943. One of l'litlers first
acts was to order the Jews to wear
the yellow armbands with the Star
of David. When the order was
issued, King Christian issued one
of his own. He said that he would
wear the armband and that he
expected every Dane to do the
same, Jew and Christian.

On the following day every
man and woman in Copenhagen

was seen wearing the Starred
armband. The I Germans were
temporarily foiled. They

appealed to their fellow "Aryans"
to cast out their Jews. The Danish
King answered that his subjects
were all Danes and that one was as
goood as the other.

The Germans then prepared
plans to sweep through Denmark

and round up the Jews for
“settlement in the East." The
Danes warned the potential

victims and then went to work.
They hid the Jews in their homes,
in hospitals and in schools. They,
in i1 few weeks, accomplished Ihe
resettlement ol' llll' Jewish
population in thr- coastal towns

Invisible Man On campus

 

 

 

 

One week ago LI 5 Wednesday
past we had a beautiful example
of publicity in action; the tic-urge
C. Wallace campaign speech.

Several thousands of area
students turned out to hear the
erudite Mr. Wallace assail anything

liberal. Of the demonstrators
there, most maintained their
composure and their tongues,

Perhaps as miiny as a thousand
were vocal in their dislike of the
gentleman.

The publicity that the vocal
segment of the crowd received
placed an unfortunate image on
the remainder, and vast majority,
of the protestors, they were
assumed to be Wallace supporters
by the representatives of mass
media.

Such a stain has been placed on
silent dissent by the incidents of
the past decade, that it is assumed
to have ceased to exist. if Gandhi
could hear that, he would be very
upset.

on the Straits of Zeeland.

Evacuation

When the Germans started to
move, so did the Danes. They,
with the aid of the Swedes, ferried
the Jews to the safety of Sweden.
Fishermen of both nations bid the
Jews in their boats and, under the
very nose of the Germans,
transported them to freedom.
When the German dragnet began,
there were no Jews to be found.

The Danes had accomplished
the evacuation of seven thousand
people. The Jews of Denmark

returned home in Illilﬁ to Find
that their homes had been tended
by their neighbors anti their
businesses protected, Today in
honor of the people of Denmark,
the people of Israel have
dedicated a “Denmark Square" in
Jerusalem. The largest plaza in
Copenhagen is today called “Israel
Square."

The Danes say that any such
recognition is appreciated but
unnecessary and that they only
(lid what any Christian would have
(lone. This of course bets the
question as to if there were any
other “Christians” in Europe. The
evirlence says that there were, but
rlamn few. And only in the case of
Denmark did they operate on a
national b is. Only thr- Danes had
the guts to protect their own
people.

Today Americans are similarly
challenged. A major candidate for
the Presidency is attracting
support on one issue, He wants to
repress twenty million Americans.
Where this repression would end,
no one knows. The late George
Lincoln Rockwell said that
George Wallace woulrl get his vote
in I968; he added that Wallace
was not a Nazi but was close
enough to suit him.

 

Wallace Fascism

What Paul O‘Dwyer calls the
“Wallace-Lemay BOMBS AWAY"
ticket stinks of Fascism and every
form of racism. We all know
where Wallace stands. He, Lemziy,
Strom Thurmond and Spiro
Agnew (who says that he would
not even tolerate boycotts as ii
means of protest) are leading this
country clown a dangerous road.
One fears that after January 1969
a knock on the rloor in the middle
of the night will have an entirely
new meaning for Americans.
We‘re gettting there.

Anti all you bear in response to
all this Is Sllt'llt't', People, "ven
good people. tloii'l seem outraged

by JIM SMALL

that this could be happening in
America. They are either amused
or resigned. As our basic liberties
are challenged, the media treats
Wallace as if he was just another
candidate.

In Albany, the television and
news media blatantly lied about
the Wallace rally. We who were
there knew that the crowd was
overwhelmingly against the
Confederacy’s candidate. And yet
the news reports gave the
impression that Wallace took
Albany by storm. The press lied
and distorted and I really don't
understand why. One even
expects a little honesty from the
llears‘l’, sisters in town. So that's
where we are: Germany 1933.

Honor the Danes
And that is why we should
honor the courage of the Duties.
As we proceedalong the path once
tread by the Germans and the
Poles, it would do us well to look
back at a people that fought back.

The. Right Way-

by Robert lumen

 

 

One of the tragedies of
contemporary America is the way
in which words that once
connoted admirable qualities have
been perverted in meaning. This is
especially true concerning college
students and the way they are
viewed by the average American.

For example, consider the word
“love.” As late as the 1950's you,
as a student, could say you were
for love, and everyone would
know exactly how you wished to
live. A person who lived a life of
love was thought to be living a life
of high moral conduct. The world
was connected by everyone with
the way things ought to be; a
perfection in attitude sought by
all, but attained by no one except
Christ.

Today, if you‘re a student who
says he believes in love people
start wondering about him. You
are no longer thought to be
righteous or moral. The average
American too often pictures it
college students conception of

I am still seeking to represent
the mirldle-ofvthe-road position, as
I did when I started this column.
()ur problem is our lack of
involvement (commonly known as
apathy). It can't continue.

‘vVi' are seeing, in this election
year, the result of years of no
concern. the candidacy of George
Wallace for lltt' Presidency of the
United States. The existence of
this candidate, anti his campaign,
indicate a large minority which
favors him. We can't ignore what
this means on a national level.

 

Way of Life

We, as ii nation, have let
prejudice and bigotry become a
way of life; whether it is between
age groups or races. Almost
without exception, we are all
victims of this ethic, to a greater

or lesser extent.

I suppose that it is a wasted

of college students; most of whom
couldn‘t give a damn. Instead 1’“

But Look
Usually it is hard for me to

argue this point, but all you need
do is look at the well«meinit
publicity of last Wednesday to see
what is happening. Wake up while
we still have a chance; scared and
distraught people are always ready

The way it looks to me, the
only way the white gates are going

You say, What's happened to
the meaning of the word? Just ask
some of your fellow students who
defame the flag, shout down
speakers, and reatse funds for the
Viet Cong, ALL in the name of
LOVE.

Well how do you feel about
war? There was once a time when
everyone was proud to say he was
for peace, because peace included
honor and security. Peace at home
and abroad was kept through
strength and courage, not
appeasement and cowardice.
Today tell the average American
that you're a college student and
you’re for peace. Guess who they
equate you with? That’s right,
with those who call for
Communist victory and wave the
Viet Cong flag. it is certainly a sad
commentary on the American
scene when you are at all hesitant
to say you are for peace for fear
of being associated with a
treasonous few. . , .

As for patriotism, let's all
consider what we have in
comparison with others in the
world. We don't have to build
fences to keep people from
leaving. In fact we're the only
country that has a waiting list of
'people who would risk their lives
to come here. We have social and
economic opportunity and
individual freedoms that men have
died for throughout our history.

We have been given these things
not because we deserve them, but
because we were fortunate
enought to be born Americans.
Don‘t we owe our country a little
respect in return'.’

Before the 1960's, believe it or
not, patriotism was an accepted
word on campus. Patriots were
thought to be those whose love of
country instilled in them the
desire to come to their nations
defense when she was in trouble.

Patriotism connoted courage,
(lL'VUllUll, and honor. Today's
student often regurth patriotism
as square, just not the "in" thing.
Why a patriot might do something
as olrlsfashionetl as supporting his
