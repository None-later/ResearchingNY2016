Smothers

TWO STUDENTS v M Mllth

Brothers’

 

    

Show

New, Different 1969 Model

by John Zeh

"The war's still on, the
country's still divided, and we’re
still here." went the song, and
sure enough, the Smothers
Brothers were back for their third
season.

Same time, same channel, but
not the same Smothers Brothers,
and not quite their same Comedy
Hour. Tom and Dick now sport
mustaches and sideburns, and
their show seems a bit more free
of CBS censors‘ bluepenciling.

“Oftentimes we have trouble
giving out thoughts because
sometimes it makes people
think." Tommy quipped. He
looks less innocent with his
mustache, and is no less serious
about network meddling with his
material. The firm stands he and
his brother have taken, along with
the growing candor in all the mass
media, have been responsible for
CBS's new liberality.

A classic example is Pete
Seeger‘s return to television after
being blacklisted as a Communist
sympathizer. First time around
the CBS people cut his “Waist
Deep in the Big Muddy" because
of its obvious slam at “Old fool"
LBJ and his war.

They let him sing it on his next
Smothers Brothers appearance.

Network officials used to get
weak knees whenever the boys
touched on touchy subjects. The
bosses banned some, required
changes in wording on others so
that fewer people would be
offended, whatever that means.

While there was at least one
phrase edited out, the season's
opener Sunday was laced with
innuendos and direct references to
such subjects once verbotcn on
prime time TV as interracial
marriage, homosexuality, race,
lingerie, and seduction.

Pat Paulsen was there, getting
in some low punches at his fellow
candidates for the Presidency. He

said he now has "so many
supporters that Major (sic) Daley
couldn't beat them all off with a
stick."

Jokes about touchy subjects
pervaded the hour, and were all
tied together in a skit spooﬁng
NBC's “Bonanza”—the Brother's
competition in the Sunday, 9 pm.
EDT time slot.

Mama Cass Elliott played
“Hass” of the “Cartwrong”
family, inspiring the line, “You're
real smart, Hass." And giant
rare, even on the Tonight Show.

"The Smut Brothers," played
by guess-who, showed up in
bad-guy black with bandunnas
saying "censored" across the
mouths. They had kidnapped the
Nielsen family. The Cartwrongs

footballer Rosy Greer appeared as
the long-lost Mrs. Cartwrong. Her
son Little Jerk (Harry Belafonte),
seeing her for the first time, said,
“You‘re a big mother."

Suggestive spice like that is
were upset about losing their
neighbors the
"Nielsens'k audiche ratings, that
is.

With the black Greer “married”
to white Ben (Paulscn), the
Cartwrong brothers lamented,
“Now we'll never get the Nielsens
back."

That line was an excellent slam
at the American viewing public. If
the Smothers Brothers lost the
rating game because of their
subject matter, it will be the
viewers‘ fault, not the program's.

FILMS

by Dave Bordwell

 

 

Since tonight IFG is screening
Jean Luc-Godard's “Band of
Outsiders" and next week I’ll be
talking about his “Weekend,” it
might be good to discuss some
aspects of Godard ‘s cinema.

It’s a personal one, unlike the
work of any other director today.
Certain stylistic quirks—the jump
cut, the fractured, elliptical
narrative, the offscreen
narrator—and certain performers—
Jean-Paul Belmondo, Anna
Karina—have been associated with
him, but his development is so
unpredictable that it escapes
simple classification.

Godard is Godard, and it's
because of this idiosyncratic
flavor that to many he is the most
interesting director in the world
today.

Godard arose from that
movement in the late fifties
known as the French New
Wave—young men, mostly film
critics, who decided that good
films could be made outside the
normal mass production
machinery.

They were unified by a
common admiration for certain
Hollywood directors (Hitchcock,
Hawks, Ford, etc.) and genres
fthrillers, Westerns), a peculiarly
0btruse bent to their writing, and
a voracious passion for movies.

This created an exciting, fresh
cinema that soon attracted
international recognition, and of
the many good film-makers
unearthed, the two most brilliant
were Francois Truffaut and
Jean-Luc Godard.

What was hard to see at the
time, but what has become
obvious now, is that the two are
very different.

Despite some fundamentally
insignificant sleights of style,
Truffaut, in his gentle lyricism, his
balanced sense of pathos and joy,
is at bottom a traditional
film-maker, the true heir to the

grand master of French cinema,
Jean Renoir.

Godard, on the other hand, is
anything but a traditional
film-maker.

“I am not interested in telling
stories,” he has said. His films do
tell stories, sort of, but to say
that, for instance, “Masculine
Feminine” is a movie about a boy

and a girl is like saying, in E.M.

“Moby
about a

Forster‘s phrase, that
Dick" is a book
whale. Godard films are
investigations, tentative
explorations of moods, places,
situations, lifestyles. They abound
in shifts of tone, open-ended
scenes, sudden juxtapositions.

Very often the ending comes
without warning; the crucial
actions may occur offscreen, with
only the emotional reverberations
showing.

Sometimes the finale is flatly
improbable (as in “Band of
Outsiders") as if to parody
traditional demands for a happy
ending. To Godard, everything in
life is filmable—a long
conversation, in political harangue,
or an inexplicable turn of mood.

They may not look it at first
sight, but his films are seriously
about people and the pressures of
civilization: the style is usually an
outgrowth of his attitude.

He, better than any other
director, has shown what it feels
like to live in modern society.

Godard is unique too in that he
is the only major film-maker to
use his films as personal
propaganda. As long as the US.
remains in Viet Nam, he has said,
his films contain
uncomplimentary references.

“La Chinoise" brings out into
the open that which was implicit
in “Masculine Feminine," but
Godard's Maoism is mainly a
by product of his concern for
people—especially the youngs-in a
world of authoritarianism and
prostitution.

Godard's visual rhythms are
unpredictable: a shot or scene
may last a fraction of a second, or
a quarter of the film’s length. But
unlike that of Warhol, Godard 's
apparent lunacy has a
justification.

He puts into his films things
that interest him at the moment,
new thoughts and ideas and slants,
so that each movie is as
self-exploratory as an essay.

Witty, passionate, detached.
ironical, uncompromising—ibis is
the picture that emerges. “One
can put everythingina film," he
has said. “One must put
everything in a film."

Broadway Play

Varied Entertainme nt

by Fred Onufryk

"Lovers" is a new play by Brian
Friel, author of "Philadelphia
Here I Come" of several season's
back. The play consists of two
one-act plays with Art Carney as
the narrator of both and the
major character of the second.

The first play is entitled
"Winners." It is the story of Mag
and Joe, who are both university
students and are to graduate in
several days. They are to be
married in three weeks'I Mag is
two months pregnant.

During parts of the play,
Carney reads their obituary, for
they later drown in an overturned
row bout. Throughout the play,
the couple talk about the past and

the future: they have their
quarrels and they make up.
Although they were

experiencing thingswhich college
students our age might
experience, I didn't feel that they
were quite real or sincere; yet,

while being characters of a
comedy, they weren‘t really
slapstick.

better acting and deeper

characterizations might have made
the couple more realistic.

The second play is "Losers."
Art Carney plays Andy Tracy who
is courting Hanna, played by
Anna Manahan. Both are in their
forties. The only problem of their
romance is Hanna's mother, a
semi-invalid and religous fanatic
who incessantly prays to St.
Philliemina.

Whenever the two are
downstairs alone, and there is a
silence of more than ten seconds,
the old woman rings a bell
summoning Hanna. This leads to
one of the funniest situations seen
on stage in a long time. In order
for the couple to enjoy each
other's tender company, they
must create a distraction of some
sort.

For this distraction, they come
upon the idea of reciting poetry,
and doing it very loudly. Miss
Manahan's acting is excellent. The
highlight of her performance
occurs when she goes into a rage
over the sound of the bell.

Carney‘s big scene occurs after
their marriage. He enters the
house drunk, and announces to
his mother-in-lnw that St.
Philhemina has lost her suinthood.

Although he uses old slapstick
routines, his sccne comes through

Provides

as being fresh and original. The
play ends on a sad note. Hanna is
no longer angry at, but now sides
with, her doting mother. Andy is
now the placid husband who sits
in the back yard and watches the
birds.

In this second play, as in the
first, the characters are not
believable, but at least they come
through as being definite and
unforgettable.

The performances of Manahan'
and Carney are well suited to the
mood of the play. While not being
too far out, they don’t take
themselves too seriously.

The characters of both plays
must be seen in contrast with each
other. While the ﬁrst couple did
die, they were still winners, as the
title suggests, and the second
couple were losers. They lived life
for its own sake and had a good
time while doing so.

Most of all, they came out and_

spoke to each other frankly. The
romance of Andy and Hanna was
a losing one. They didn’t live a
romance for its own sake; they
lived it in spite of a common
enemy.

There is no indication that they
actually sat down and seriously,
or even casually, talked things
over frankly. It wasn't until after
the marriage that they realized
that they had no common
grounds, except the battle ground.

Their realization came too late,
and therefore, it was a losing
combination.While neither are
comedies nor tragedies in the
classical sense, they give a
portrayal of common dilemmas of
common people in a light vein.

The Irish playwrite has once
again come up with a comedy of
better than average quality. It is
worth seeing, and well worth
seeing before Carney ends his
engagement on November 2.
