“The only way to hurt the
growers is through the
pocketbook,"stated Bill Berg, who
has worked with the grape pickers
for two years.

This is what the nationwide
boycott of grapes is trying to
achieve.

On Friday, October 19, a rally
was held at the Brothers
headquarters on North Pearl Street
supporting the grape pickers.
Information on the plight of these
workers was presented by one of
the Brothers.

While working in the fields,
there are no sanitary facilities
available for use. The temperature

In addition to these physical
hardships, their average pay is
$1800 per year for a 10-12 hour
working day.

An appeal to the students ofthe
University was made to refuse to
eat any grapes which are served in
the dininghalls.

It was also suggested that the
students become vocal and take
action to support the grape pickers.
If necessary, they suggested, refuse
to eat the meal and fast in order to
urge the food service to support the
grape boycott.

A student present informed the
speaker that Central Council has
already passed a bill which requests
food service to refrain from serving
grapes or grape products.

The main purpose of this rally
was to picket the A&P stores in the
Albany area since the district
manager has refused to stop buying
grapes and said that he does not
have the authority to do so.

In New York and Philadelphia
A&P stores have supported the
boycott and the President of the
company has said that the decision
is up to the local district manager.

Picketers were then dispatched
to the district headquarters on
Fuller Road and a number of local
stores.

Approximately 30 people were
present at Fuller Road where they
picketed without obstructing or
inconveniencing customers, Flyers
were distributed describing the
conditions which have provoked

has been in effect for 3 years.

The strike itself has been a
peaceful one with no violence
initiated by the strikers.

Most of the shoppers received
the material graciously and seemed
to indicate that they sympathized
with the grape pickers.

As the flyers were read, some of
the customers assured the pickcters
that they would support the
boycott and not buy grapes.

VATICAN CITY (UPI)—-Jac-
queline Kennedy Onassis know-
ingly violated Roman Catholic
Church law in marrying a
divorced man and is now cut off
from sacraments of the church,
an official Vatican spokesman
said Monday night. He declined
to use the term “excommuni-
cated."

“It is clear that when I
Catholic marries a divorced
man, she knowingly violated the
law of the church," Msgr.
Fausto Vallainc, chief of the
Vatican press office, said.

"It is not a question of
excommunication. It is what is
termed in canon law an
irregular situation."

An irregular situation means
that a Catholic can still go to
church and pray but cannot
receive communion or partici-
pate in other sacraments. This
is less serious than excommuni-
cation, which cuts a Catholic off
totally from the life of the
church.

Vallainc‘s statement was the
first official comment from the
Vatican on the marriage of the
39Ayear-old widow of John F.
Kennedy to Aristotle Onassis,
62vyear-old Greek multimillionv
aire.

Chairman

peaks On Revolt

byBllI McAth

The New York State chairman
of the Young Socialist Alliance,
Daniel Rosenshine, talked to a
group of interested students at a
lecture Thursday, October 16, on
the topic “From Student Revolt
to Socialist Revolution."

Rosenshine stated that he
believes there exists today, a
world wide student revolution.
And speciﬁcally in the U.S., this
student revolt began on the
college campuses in protests and
demonstrations against the war.

According to Rosenshine, the
student revolt is becoming a world
wide socialist revolution, and
people in other countries admire

Campaigns In New York

By JOHN HALL

NEW YORK (UPliAHubcrt
H. Humphrey began his stretch
drive for the presidency Tues-
day with a listless outdoor rally
and an appeal for help from
New York’s divided Democratic
party.

The vice president, bidding

new administration must begin by
rc-nrranging the priorities of the
country in terms of the federal
budget.

Private enterprise, he stated,
must cooperate with the
government in reestablishing
economic growth in the cities.

According to the Senator, the
economic situation is one of
“galloping inflation." He said this
situation could be controlled by
repressing interest rates, and
through credit control by the
Federal Reserve Board.

In response to a question,
Senator Javits gave reasons for his
endorsement of the Nixon ticket
which he said, “constitutionally
includes Governor Agnew." There
are four things which he believes
Nixon can do better than
llumphrcy:

First, Vietnam. Nixon has a
better Chich for making progress
because he is nol locked to the
commitments of the past
administration.

Scr'ondlv , he called the “Now

Dual" concepts, which have

li‘ourthly, Nixon has the

States.

Even though he supports the
Nixon ticket, Javits several times
stressed the fact that be was his
“own man."

strongly for New York‘s crucial
43 electoral votes, made his
third appearance here in two
weeks and told about 200 local
Democratic leaders New York
“could be the one which tips the
scales.“

For himself, Humphrey said
sometimes it is all he can do to
get out of bed in the morning
and face the “heartaches” of a
divided party and the obstacles
of a latc-stari‘ ~rz campaign.

“But I'll tell you one thing,”
he said. “I will carry on this
ﬁght to the last minute, the last
hour and the last day even if I
end up with just my wife and
myself even if she quits. I'm
not about to let Richard
Millbous Nixon become pres-
idcnt."

Later, Humphrey stood hat-
less and without an ovcrcorrst at
a chilly noontime rally in
Herald Square and told a crowd
of about 10,000 “You hever had
it any better than you had
under a Democratic administra-
tion and you know it."

There was no applause.

demands and set aside the regular
class subject in deference to these
discussions."

A policy resolution on
California Grape Workers was also
approved by Council. “Whereas
every individual has certain basic
rights among which are the right
to make a decent living, equality
under the law, freedom from
unjust persecution as a minority
group, and the right to have a
voice in his destiny, and Whereas
the grape harvesters in California
have been consistantly denied
these rights, earn only a
subsistance wage, and live in
virtual slavery within the U.S.,
and Whereas it is the duty of
every individual and organization
to use whatever influence it may
have to secure these rights for
everyone."

This resolution was followed by
a Council act asking Food Service
to "boycott grapes and grape
products by refusing to buy or
serve grapes or grape products in
any form until Food Service is

informed by Central Council that
as id boycott is terminated.

Council also "implores the
student body to boycott grapes or
grape products by refusing to buy
or consume grapes or grape
products in any form on or off
campus."

Council dropped the
requirement of membership in the
Student Association for future
Who' Who candidates. A list of 51
candidates for this year’s Who‘s
Who election was accepted at that
time.

Other action in the meeting was
concerned with the recent actions
of the Faculty Senate. One
general resolution was passed in
which the Council called upon the
Faculty Senate to provide its
rationale for the small number of
student representatives on its
committees.

Only one student position is
open on many Faculty Councils,
and no more than four students
on any one council.

the U.S. for the courage to
demonstrate against the war iii
Vietnam.

In speaking about the Vietnam
situation, he says that what ll
really being challenged in Vietnam
is the right of the U.S. to
intervene in countries throughout
the world.

In short, Rosemhine aid that
the people of Vietnam have been
ﬁghting a war to rid their country
of foreign control.

Rosenshine spoke brieﬂy on
the recent Czechoslavkian revolt
against Russian dominance, saying
that what the people really
wanted was a more socialistic
(anti-capitalistic) society, not a
more westernized society.

The Youngl Revolutionary
Communists, said Rosenshine, is
the French counter part to the
Young Socialist Alliance in
America. And, in France after the
strikes and riots of this past May
were over, the Communist Party
of France proposed a “liberal
capitalist government" for the
country.

In an interview with
Rosenshine, he made it clear that
in no way do the socialists
advocate violent revolution as a
means to accomplish their
objectives.

On the contrary, Rosenshine
said, “we want to win a majority
of the society over for change."

He believes socialism has to
take over in the U.S. for the good
of the people because what
America has now is a capitalist
society with certain democratic
rights, but does not believe
democracy and capitalism can
exist together in one society.

When asked why the two are
incompatible, Rosenshine
answered, “the capitalists do not
respect human rights.”

Rosenshine predicts the
eventual take over of the U.S.
