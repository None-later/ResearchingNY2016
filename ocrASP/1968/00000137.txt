False Alarm

To the Editor:

Tuesday night we girls of
Whitman Hall experienced a false
alarm. Happening a little over an
hour and a half after a “planned”
fire drill, it was an unpleasant
surprise. But the reason for this
letter is not to condemn whoever
set off the alarm. Instead, I would
like to make public two
conditions.

Most of us had returned to
sleep between 12:15 and 1:40
AM, when the fire alarm sounded
again. Sound asleep in our beds,
we were unable to hear the alarm
bell. It has been said that this has
always been true. The sound
cannot penetrate two ﬁre doors
into our bedrooms.

Luckily, a few girls were still
awake. They shook others out of
bed and force them into the cool,
moist air outside. Luckily, too,
Mike Friedman, the director of
Anthony and Cooper Halls, made
it up the two flights to awaken
others, before the alarm had even
stopped ringing. But what if there
HAD been a real fire? Would
many of the 96 girls have
beentrapped? Louder bells,
perhaps an alarm in each study, if
not in each room, must be
installed.

The second topic of importance
is one which has long been
discussed: the gates. Now it is not
merely that the pizza man must
walk a few hundred feet to deliver
luke-warm pizzas. The six fire
trucks were unable to enter State
Quad through the locked gates.
They had to detour by way of the
podium. Perhaps in case of
emergency they would not have
arrived in time.

For the safety of all of us,
better alarms must be installed.
The gates must be kept open.
Next time may not be a false
alarm!

On Rosenberg

To the Editor:

l have read M, J. Rosenberg's
column of October 18 and I am
incensed by Mr. Rosenberg’s
charge that during World War II,
Poland "joined the victorious
master eagerly."

Anyone with even a meager
knowledge of the Second World
War, would know of the heroic
resistance of the Polish people
during Nazi occupation. Even
before the fall of Warsaw,
underground activity was
organized. Activity was continued
by several organizations'ﬁimong
them the "Home Army" under
Gen. Tadeusz Komorowski (the
famous “General Bor" of the
Warsaw Rebellion of 1944) and
the Communist organized
“People‘s Army."

Several Polish armies-in-cxile
were formed and served in France,
Russia, Africa. and ltnly. Polish
forces served with valor at 'i‘obruk
and Monte Cassino. Polish airmen
flow for the RAF in the Battle of
Britain.

l hope I have set the record
straight on this matter for Mr.
Rosenberg and anyone else who
was mislead. Thank you.

Tax Point

To the Editor:

The A.S.l‘. run a beautifully
moving editorial on student tax
inst ’l‘uesday. The only trouble is

that after about seven paragraphs
of space filler, the editor really hit
the point in question and than
dismissed it with a ridiculous
analogy. The central point of the
argument is this: “Why should a
student pay for a service he
doesn't use? Let those who use
the service pay for it themselves."

Now I sincerely question the
competence of the editor who
drew the analogy betwaen those
who refuse to pay student tax and
those who refuse to pay tax to
support Welfare program. Since
when is SA in the business of
making welfare transfers? As I
understand the welfare program,
it is designed to provide a
subsistence of living for needy
persons. Since when are SA social
activities necessary to a student?
The analogy is obviously false,
and therefore the central point of

 
 

w‘

lSun:

“III-ale  FiclL So in. ’the

 

the argument remains untouched.

I maintain that no student
should be forced to pay for a
service he does not use. The lack
of participation in student tax
benefits should be saying
something to SA. If the tax card
really gave that many benefits to
so many studctns, i feel that there
would be a greater demand for tax

cards. When SA provides $28.75
worth of activities per semester
that I feel I would like to
participate in, then SA deserves
my $28.75. Right now I read the
SA-funded ASO, but for $28.75
per semester I think Icould forgo
it. If 9,999 students go to the

polls in favor of mandatory
student tax, you have here one
dissenting vote, and therefore

$28.75 per semester that SA will
never see.

Mandatory Tax

To the Editor:

The mandatory student fcc
comes up for your approval very
quickly.

Wednesday through Friday, a
referendum will be held in
conjunction with the Central
Council and LAAC Elections in
the Main Lounge on the first floor
of the Campus Center.

With a mandatory student fee,
it will be much easier for Student
Association Budget Committee
and Central Council to establish a
sound basis for the financing of
future events, publications, and
organizations.

At present, Budget Committee
tries to guess at the percentage of
the Student Body which will pay
the assessment fee for the coming
year. On this guessed-factor basis,
they then establish the guidelines
for budgeting.

This is often precarious and
disastrous business. if the guessed
factor is incorrect, Student
Association and you go into debt.
It then necessitates cutting back
budgets for every event,
publication, or organization.

With the decreased budgets, it
becomes increasingly harder to

present better concerts,
publications, mixers, speakers,
and programs for all

organizations. With the
mandatory fee, the budgets for all
groups can be established at in
level to allow all this better
programming.

in addition, all of this may be
offered at a lower fee than is
presently being paid! With the
increased amount of money. a
wider scope of programming will
be entirely possible. This
assuredly benefits all of the
student body.

Many students feel that they
receive no beneﬁts from the
student fee. This is not accurate.

It appears that the biggest
casualty of 1968, has been and is
going to be liberalism. This is
evidenced by the facts that
liberalism, as understood by the
Democrats in Chicago, was done
away with in the form of
McCarthy; that the Republicans in
Miami shelved liberalism in the
form of Rockefeller; and that
liberalism as the public sees it
now, will be done away with in
the form of Humphrey.

While it is not suggested that
every person, persons, or idea
flying the l beral banner will be
dumped in similar fashion, it is
suggested that the chances of this
occuring are increasing.

in a word, the meaning of
liberalism has diffused and its
connotations are likely to be
undesirable. The question: Why"

Several causes for the liberal
casualty can be discerned, most of
which are coming from the
spheres of contemporary politics
and the general public.

Some blows, for example, an-
being self-inflicted by Sfi-UilllL‘Il
liberal politicrans who apply their
own brand of liberalism to social
and foreign policy, thus being
anything but consistent; and by
the growing number of liberal
politicians, scholars, and social
figures who have lent active and
passive support to extremists and
extreme causes.

Sueh actions are generalized by
the American public to all liberals
and to liberalism in particular.

A third reason for Llll‘
decreasing power of liberalism has
been, on the one hand, the
attainment of a suitable place in
society by former liberal
supportch (cg, labor), at . on
the other, by the desire of such
old‘timc supporters to keep the
Negro from threatening their
position' which they are seen as
doing with the backing of the
liberal community.

And lastly, there has been a
combination of factors which
middle class America has
interpcrted to be liberal sponsored
or liberal associated, and which
they do not particularly like: fear
of an upset in the status quo and
the rise of the Negro; fear of
domestic violence and of moral
decline; concern over the incrcsing
number of labor strikes and
university radicals; fear of a
sellout in Vietnam, etc,

All such factors end up as being
associated with a vague kind of
liberalism, sometimes correctly,
sometimes incorrectly, so.

in the short run this means a
swing to the right by the
American voters Ibis ycar.

HumphreyShouts Down

In the long run, the results
could be either good or bad.
Perhaps a Republican Rest is
needed; perhaps it will prepare the
way for a Kennedy-type
Presidency in 1972.

Perhaps, however, the liberal
cause will be seriously slowed and
the shift right continued. If so,
stormy days may lie ahead.

“Haley’s Comment"

On The

Other Hand
by Tom Ceroone and Doug Goldschmldt

  

 

 

llie most commdﬁ' complaint
on campus is the constant
criticism of Food Service.
Students, however, have no
understanding or appreciation of
the situation. Upon investigating
the problem one soon surmiscs
that the criticisms are founded on
fantasy, not fact.

Last week in an interview with
Peter Haley of Food Service, we
learned the following:

Qualify Is a mam-r of individual
preference \Yliilv Food Service
offers a ‘Nl(li‘ vuriI-ly of main
courses and n I'lcxtlrlu selection of
garnisltmonts [such as salads, rolls,
soups. etc), ll is impossible to
please cvcryone at each meal.

Personal anxieties and
frustrations and a general dislike
of dormitory life combine to
prejudice the student against
Food Service.

One must understand that
living in il dormitory is not like
living at home, that dormitory
food does not cater to each
individual's taste as does
homc‘cooked food.

Institutional cooking cannot by
its very nature, be superlative. The
student should not allow his
academic anxieties to be released
in a vindictive against Food
Service. Selective preference (loos
not indicate low quality.

When the quality of the food
seems lower titan average this may
be due to any number of
problems beyond the control of
Food Service: people coming in
late en masse after an activity are
greeted by food that has been on
hot plates for some time; suppliers
are often low on supplies and
truck shipments are often delayed
by traffic jams facilitating an
unexpected change in menu; and
at times the kitchen is
understaffed due to illness.

Futhermorc, considering the
extremely low student cost per
meal, on cannot expect steak
every night.

“The waste is staggering." Due
to unlawful use of meal cards at
the beginning of this semester,
Food Service was serving between
four and five hundred unpaid for
meals each day.

Wallace !

To the Editor,

Last week in Albany, New
York, George Wallace did not
receive the warm reception and
enthusiastic crowds of
pro-Wallace supporters that many
of the local radio and television
ncwscustcrs believed he did.
Anyone who had a panoramic
view of the freak show at the
Capitol could easily relay the
truth about Wallace's speech. The
citizens of Albany deserve much
greater candidncss from
newscaster. One does not have to
feel hatred towards the candidate
to relate the truth; even Wallace's
fellow rucrsts here in Albany
know their candidate received
nothing at all resembling a warm
reception, nor did he "sweep
Albany" us one local television
station claimed he did.

 

 

Saying that the crowd was
“peppered with protestors and
anti-Wallace demonstrators" is
completely distorting the truth.
The truth was just the opposit:
The crowd was ‘peppered with
bigots and nco-nazi'; these were
the only people who appeared
sympathetic to the speaker. Why
should the mass media hide the
truth '.’ Maybe the newscastcrs
would enjoy seeing their own
freedom of speech curtailed by
President Wallace. Maybe they
feel that this nation and this city
are in desparutc need of
increased “law and order";
possibly similar to the law and
order that fails to convict the Ku
Klux Klan murderers.

When the average man in
Albany hears that Wallace was
constantly interrupted by long
haired and filthy anarchist, this
only helps the cause of this
Nuzi-likc racist. Perhaps if the
newscasters made it known that
the majority of Wallace's
oppostion is clean shavcn college
educated, and dedicated to better
government, we would not have
to fear the possibility of the rise
of the ‘lth Reich. All we demand
is the real truth!

Queen Mary?

To the Editor:

It is indeed unfortunate that a
girl as basically qualified for
Homecoming Queen as Mary
Mencer had to be involved in a
conflict of interests to attain a
goal prized by many girls in the
school. Mary Mencer more than
fulfills the requirements nl
poise, personality llllll

beauty,

intelligence on which the judges
make their decision. However, for
a fair choice to have been made,
either Miss Mench should have
resigned as Co-chairman of
Homecoming or withdrawn her
name from competition.

it does not seem humanly
possible for any normal person,
including the judges, to be
completely objective when one of
the people in the contest helped
afford them their prestigious
positions. Further exploration of
the subject would lead a truly
"untrusting" individual to wonder
exactly who did pick the judges in
the first place and why their
names were not released to the
student body.

The presence of Mary Mencer
in the contest, no less her victory,
was totally unfair to the other
girls in the competition and the
trganizations sponsoring them
