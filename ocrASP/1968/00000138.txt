THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH,
under the direction of Martin Marin
is in rehearsal for performances on
November 6-9, 1968 at Page Hall.
This first production of the
1968-69 season by the State
University Theatre is Thornton
Wilder‘s Pulitzer Prize winning play
which opened on Broadway in
1942.

All humanity is the hero,
personified in the figure of George
Antrobus. He is Adam, Noah, in
fact every great hero of humanity.
He invents the wheel and the
alphabet, lives through the Fall, the
Flood and various wars, the Ice Age
and countless other catastrophes,
and yet his life struggles on. His
wife Eva bears him two boys and a
girl, but Cain or Henry, the elder
murders his brother. A maid,
Sabina, serves as a sort ofLiloth or
personification of female sensuality.
The Antrobus family is living both
in prehistoric times and in a New
Jersey commuters' suburb today.
The events of homely daily life are
depicted against the vast
dimensions of time and space and
impending disaster.

In Atlantic City at the
convention of the Ancient and
Honorable Order of Mammals,
Subdivision Humans, George
Antrobus is to address the
gathering, the theme of his talk
being “Enjoy Yourselves."

The Flood begins but the family
survives by the skin of their teeth.
Returning to the suburban home, a
war has just ended. Henry or Cain
was the enemy, and Sabina the
camp-follower. George Antrobus,
the father, is now the creative and
inventive spirit in humanity.
George ever optimistic prepares for
a better world with his Weapons.
books; ideas and human creativity
Man will survive, says Wilder. by
the proverbial skin of his teeth, but
why does he always operate with so
narrow a margin?

Statue Of Livingston

The statue of Robert
Livingston, created by Erastus
Dow Palmer, was presented to the
University on a long-term basis by
the Albany Institue of History
and Art. The presentation took
place on Friday, October 18th at
Livingston Tower.

The sculpture itself is the
orginal plaster ﬁgure made by
Palmer in 1874. Two bronze
castings were made from this

original and were place in
Washington Dc. at the Court of
Appeals.

Norman Rice, President of the
Institute, presented the statue at 2
pm. Macie Shemaire and Linda
Bacon, co-chairmen of the Tower
government, accepted the
sculpture.

Livingston was born in New
York City in 1746. He helped
draw up the Declaration of
Indpendence, and was United
States Minister to France. He was
the founder and first president of
the American Academy of Fine
Arts, and had a wide range of

“Music from Marlboro" was the
title of the program presented by
Music Council last Saturday night
in Page Hall.

The performance of the various
artists was, on the whole,
thoroughly enjoyable, although
there were some distractions.

The program opened with a
Quartet by Mozart (in D Major for
flute and strings, K. 285--for those
of you who can’t live withoutsuch
information). This was good. It was
performed in such a way that if you
had been listening to it on a record
album, you’d want to pick up the
needle and play it over again. A
special word must be said for Paula
Sylvester, who played the Flute.
This work is essentially a flute solo;
i.e. the flute plays such a major part
in it that there had darn well better
be a good flutist or it's pointless to
go on with the piece. Miss Sylvester
was more than adequate.

Next was a String Trio (in A
minor, Op. 77b) by Reger which
was all right, but i think that the
audience could have done just as
well without the heavy breathing
of the violinist.

The second half of the concert
featured Heidi Lehwalder, harpist.
Debussy’s Sonata for Flute, Viola,
and Harp was the first work played

Leader

On And Off Field

Not many times do you find a
person who is not only a good
athlete, but a scholar too. Here at
Ablany, there is such a person in
the name of Craig Springer.

The 5'11", 165 pound senior
from Levittown Memorial High
School in Levittown, New York
not only won a varsity letter in
soccer, wrestling and track in high
school, but was also named an
athlete-scholar in 1965 by the
Long Island Press.

At Albany, Craig, who is a
resident assistant, is a member of
both the wrestling and soccer
teams.

Although he is a fine athlete,
Craig, who is a math major, seems
to outdo his athletic achievements
in thr- classroom. llis academic
honors include making Dean’s List.
from 1965-67 and receiving thi-
James Warden Scholarship.

Craig, who is a member of S'I'B
also belongs to the elite society of
Myskania and serves on the

Pan-llellnnic Council.

On the soccer team, Craig has
played both outside wing and
fullback, his present position. He
has. in his play, proven himself to

be a steady performer for the
squad.

“is wrestling prOWess has also
been established by his consistent
performance on the mats. In his
freshman year, Craig was awarded
the Tiger-Tail Award which is given
to the freshman wrestler with the
most take-downs during the year.

Craig is truly a special kind of
person and will undoubtedly
succeed in anything he Ventures
into after his graduation from
college.

 

  Soccer Team I Drops Fifth;

Plattsburgh 6 - 0 Victor

Saturday, the Great Danes traveled to Plattsburgh to meet the ninth rank team in the state and did not
fare too well. The final score was 6-0, but Albany showed good strong play at many times throughout the
game. Plattsburgh was led by two strong footed foreign boys who scored all of their goals.

Albany just proved too weak an opponent for the home team. Although the outcome was dismal, there
were many players who showed a great deal of potential for next season.

Joel Volinski started and played a fine game a

the offense at different times.
Joel, a sophomore. has been
improving game by game and now
seems certain to earn himself a
starting position next season.

Al Rosenberg, who has been
steadily improving, was ill with a
stomach virus and could not make
the trip. This also weakened the
team’s depth. The season‘s record
now stands at 1-5-1 with Utica
coming up today at 4:00 at the
latter’s field.

Cheerleaders
Wanted For

State Teams

All undergraduate students who
are iiiterestedin cheerleading for the
basketball season are eligible to try
out for the two cheerleading
squads. All places on the squads are
open to freshmen and
upperclassmen alike, and to men
and women. This method of
organization is new to Albany and
should result in a high quality of
crowd leadership and vocal support
for the teams.

An organizational meeting is
scheduled for Thursday, October
24, in the second floor gymnasium
of the physical education center. A
series of practices will be held
before the try-out session. Those
who attend should wear shorts and
sneakers,

Frosh Cross Country
Drops Heartbreakcr

by Tony Cantor!)

'l‘l‘ic freshman cross country
team suffered a heartbreaking
defeat, last Saturday at the hands of
a fine Colgate frosh team.The ﬁnal
score saw the Albany State barriers
defeated by the narrow margin of
one point, Colgate 27 and Albany
28.

 

 

Although the frosh lost, they
continued their steady progress
throughout the year by showing
improvement at Colgate. All year
they have been hampered by a lack
of depth beyond their three best
runners (l-iackett, Holmes and
Wittig). However it appeared that
while the first three runners have
continued to improve, the other
members of the team have also
been developing. Most notably is
the example of Paul Novakowski
who has produced strong
performances in the last two meets.

Dennis liukuckett produced
another excellent performance.
Meet after meet throughout the
year he has recorded outstanding
efforts. With his win at Colgate,
Dennis remained undefeated in
dual competition while covering
the 2.88 mile course in IS minutes
and one sccnd.

He took the lead iit the start and
was never threatened. The only
meet that he has failed to finish
ﬁrst was at the Le Moync
Invitational where he finished
sixth,

Lou Wittig, l’aiil Holmes and
Paul Novakowski also registered
good efforts for State. Lou Wittig
and Paul llolmes continued their
consistent performances by
finishing fourth and fifth
respectfully at Colgate. Probably
the most encouraging effort
recorded at Colgate for Albany was
registered by Dave Novakowski
who finished eighth. This effort, it
is hoped will add depth for the
frosh’s next start at the Albany
Invitational Cross Country Meet on
October 26.

Albany’s defensive half-backs and
full-backs. Albany defeated Green
Mountain College for the second
season in a row on October 15,
taking tiicm by the score of 3-].
Carol Wiley and Pam Kelley were
responsible for Albany's goals,
