Nix On Sports

Throughout the school year, a question which is often raised is why the
State University system does not offer athletic scholarships of any kind.
This question becomes particularly prevalent when one ofAlbany’s teams
is suffering an especially disastrous season.

At ﬁrst glance, it seems unreasonable that there is no system of athletic
scholarships for students attending state schools. 0n the surface, there
appears to be no sufﬁcient basis for refusing to grant scholarships merely
on athletic, not scholastic ability. Yet, when the philosophy behind the
present system is explored, there seems to be ample evidence to
substantiate the State's stand.

The reason offered for the refusal to grant athletic scholarships,
somewhat simpliﬁed, is that the state school is set up as an academic
system ﬁrst, and a center ofathletics second. The philosophy is that the
typical recipient of an athletic scholarship is either unable to meet the
preliminary admissions requirements or will not be able to maintain a high
enough academic record to remain once admitted.

Granted, it must be admitted that many individuals who receive
athletic scholarhsips to other colleges would not be able to maintain the
grades necessary to remain at Albany. But how about the individual who
" is both an athlete and a scholar? Shouldn't it be possible for him to gain
some kind of assistance in meeting financial responsibilities on the
strength of athletic prowess? Why shouldn’t there be a system of
u“ acknowledging not only academic ability, but athletic ability as well" It"
i an individual has prove himself capable of meeting the necessary
‘ scholastic requirements. why shouldn't he be given a scholarhsip for his
athletic abilities‘.’

Probably every Coach on Albany‘s staff could tell of athletes who
would have attended Albany ifonly they could have received some form

of scholarship to help them meet ﬁnancial obligation. ('ertainly the

record of Albany's athletic squads would be improved if some form of

athletic scholarships were introdticed. And how could the powers that be

object if the athletes involved maintained the necessary scholastic

achievement?

Even Mr. Munsey, who has one of the most impressive records in

Albany history can tell of athletes he has lost because of the lack of

scholarhsips at Albany. Certainly teams such as this years could only be

helped by the presence ofscholarship athletes.

I see no reason why it is not possible for athletic scholarships to be

giver. without lowering the academic standards so highly prized.

The freshman soccer team lost
two more games this past week,
and have yet to break their winlcss
streak, with only four games left.

On Thursday afternoon, we met
R.P.I.'s frosh squad. R.P.l. has
many foreign boys on their team
and have already defeated their
own varsity. They had no problems
getting an early lead, racking up
seven goals in the first period. They
scored twico more in the third. The
second and fourth periods were
socreloss, with the final score 9-0.
It was simply a matter of R.P.l.‘s
great passwork and accurate
shooting.

Albany put only nine shots on
goal. R.I’.I.‘s goals were divided
among three players. Trappcnburg
scored six, Ilousel 2, and Kamuge
1. Chris Weaver played a solid game
as fullback for State.

Fulton scored one again in the

The Veterans, three of whom
claimed to have signed armed

them to arrest if they let out

suggested the possibilities of strict
press censorship and brainwashing

of both the public and the
servicemen.

The first speaker, Irving
Rosenberg, is a World War II

veteran who accused President
Johnson of being part of the
"military industrial complex." He
also asserted that a statement
made by Woodrow Wilson in 1919
saying that W I was fought not
to save democracy, but to make
industry proﬁt, is now applicable
to the Vietnam War.

The next speaker, Dick
Simmons, is disillusioned with
military authority which was

demonstrated when he said, “I
spent three years in the army, and
I don't trust them."

Action on student membership to the Faculty

David McReynolds, the Peace
and Freedom Party‘s candidate
for Congress from the 19th
Congressional District, discussed
“Revolution in the United States"
in a lecture which was a part of
the University's Anti-War Week.

McReynolds believes liberalism
is not enough to change today's
society. He advocates moving
beyond liberalism to radicalism.

Revolution in the U.S.,
McReynolds says, is being
initiated by the two oppressed
groups in today’s society: the
Blacks, and the middle class
community.

These two groups function in
the present on the basis of the
future. According to McReynolds,
this simply means that the middle
class and black people of the U.S.
look ahead to the future and can
see what conditions will be like if
present policy continues.

With this in mind, they realize
that they must act now, in the
present, if the future is going to
be any better.

McReynolds believes that the
complete change of the United
States’ society cannot be
accomplished by studying the past
revolutions of people such as
Lenin in the U.S.S.R. or Gandhi
in India.

The revolution in the U.S. will
be new and different front any
other situation that has, in the
past, brought on revolution.

However, McReynolds feels
that something can be learned by

have been conducted in the U.S.
by such people as Martin Luther
King and Eugene Debs.

McReynolds wants the
revolution to change present
conditions so that corporations
will be responsive to public
demands, the war in Vietnam will
be over and more money will be
available to initiate programs that
will help solve the problems that
the nation faces today, and
numerous other changes.

In speaking about the war in
Vietnam, McReynolds states that
the war is only an example of the

entire problems that the U.S.
faces today.
McReynoIds mentioned, that

this is not the first tlme the U.S.
has been involved in a situation
such as Vietnam, but it is the first
time that the U.S. has been
beaten, and the government
doesn't quite know how to cope
with the situation.

The revolution McReynoIds
advocates will be nonviolent. He
believes violence exists only when
people become confused.

By staying in the U.S. and
resisting the draft by publicly
burning your draft card, by voting
for candidates for government
officers from the Peace and
Freedom Part. and by uniting
together in a unifies resistance to
the present government,
McReynolds believes radical
changes can be, and must be made
in the United States.
