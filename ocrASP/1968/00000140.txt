subtitled, “The Day the Subway
Ran Over a Guy," was written and

Curly, a hack writer; a pregnant
girl; a minister; the subway
conductor; and the hero, Noman.

Father Smith Speaks
About Birth Control

vaebbie Hummd

“The split between the official
teachings and conscience is not a
happy affair for the traditional
Catholic,” commented Father
James Smith on the implications
of the Pope's recent enciclical on
birth control.

Father Smith’s talk on
"Implications of Birth Control"
was part of a program sponsored
by Newman Club, Friday
afternoon Oct 13. The unique
feature of this meeting, attended
by twenty members, was the
degree of student involvement in
discussing the issues.

“The question of authority and
how and where it comes from is
an issue of great importance."
continued Father Smith. “In
establishing II teaching, is it
arrived at by the people it will
affect or just those at the top? Is
it a true teaching with Christ’s
authority behind it.”

Questioning a statement that
the “truth will be discovered in
time," one student said,“We're
living now. We want an answer to
these problems. Why can’t the
two camps tolerate each other
instead of trying to force
everyone to conform?“

Discussing human sexuality,
Father Smith stated that “the two
attitudes towards it, that of sex
for reproduction and for
fulfillment and expression, must
be present in a successful
relationship, Either aspect by
itself can be disastrous."

Commenting on future moral
problems. F‘Iithcr Smith spoke of

Javits Refuses To Pledge
Senate Support To Agnew

SYRACUSE, N. Y. (UPI) -
Sen. Jacob Javits Thursday re-
fused to pledge his vote for
Spiro T. Agnew if the selection
)f a president and vice presi-
dent is thrown into Congress.

If no candidate receives a
majority in the electoral college,
the House of Representatives
will vote on a new president and
the Senate will select the vice
president.

“I hope I will be able to sup-
port the Republican party can-
didate, but at this time I can-
not pledge myself to any can-
didate,” Javits told a news
conference.

Javits and Agnew have had
their differences during the
present campaign.

Last week Agnew criticized
Hubert Humphrey for accepting
Lhe Liberal party endorsement
n New York State and cm-
)racing what he termed, the
party‘s “far out views," The
statement was embarussing to
Javits who has also accepted
Liberal party bucking.

changes in curriculum.” Members
of the committee would also have
some say in departmental
problems, such as the hiring and
firing of faculty members.

Mr. Frederik Rusch, a doctoral
candidate, was then elected
temporary chairman of a steering
committee which undertook the
responsibility of arranging for
nominations and the election of
interested English majors to the
advisory committtee.

Those in attendance were then
faced with the task of determining
the size and composition of the
committee. They agreed upon a
committee composed of two
representatives from each class
and two representatives from the
graduated students for a total
membership of ten. The

committee itself would elect a
chairman from among its
membership.

Self-nominations of English
majors seeking membership on the
committee were to be submitted
to the English Department office

Curriculum

no later than Wednesday, Oct 23.
A list of nominees will be posted
this week on the English
Department bulletin board on the
third floor of the Humanities
Building.

Voting will take place by ballot
on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday, Oct 28-30. The
procedure for balloting is yet to
be announced. At the designated
time and place, English majors
will have the opportunity to vote
for two representatives. from
within their own class year.

Although there is already a
similar faculty committee in
existence to advise English
Department Chairman Prof.
Townsend Rich, students had not
been included in departmental
decisions prior to this year. The

good attendance at the
organizational meeting and the
evident interest of those in

attendance indicate English
majors’ eagerness to have an
effective means of conveying their
opinions to the faculty.
