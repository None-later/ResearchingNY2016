QUEEN MARY!
better to the Editor:

In answer to a letter to the
editor of the ASP (10/22/68),
“Queen Mary?", I have the
following remarks to make:

As a member of Special Events
Board, I have an obligation to
help out on events other than the
one for which I am responsible.
At the ﬁrst meeting of Special
Events Board this year, I was
appointed to be the chairman of
the Homecoming Queen Contest
by the chairmen of Homecoming
Weekend—Mike Gerber and Mary
Mencer.

It was understood at the time
of my appointment that I would
have complete control over every
aspect of the contest, and that I
would receive no intervention
from the co-chairmen. With this
thought in mind, I planned the
contest.

It is not necessary to spell out
how I planned the contest, but it
is essential to say that I developed
every policy which would govern
the contest. No one else helped
me in policy formation.

I decided how the contest was
to be managed,

I decided when the Queen
would be crowned.

I decided how many girls each
organization could nominate. The
co-chairmen of Homecoming
Weekend had NOTHING to do
with any of the decisions made
for the Queen contest.

I decided who the Judges were
to be. The following people were
judges: Mrs. Lois Cress. Mr. Dell
Thompson, Mr. Malcolm Corbiey,

Mrs.’ Richard ‘Pierce, Mrs.

Election Forum for People
Concerned About Peace, Friday. Oct.
25, at it RM. in Assembly Hall, C.C.

     

Josephine Harris, Mr. Joseph
Silvey, Mr. Richard Wesley, Miss
Sharon Rock, Mr. Anthony

Casale, Miss Leila Moore, Mr.
Peter Pavone, and Mr. Howard
Woodruff.

It is not necessary to enumerate
the reasons for choosing these 12
people.

I instructed the judges as to
how to rate the girls in the two
competitions. At no time during
the contest was it ever announced
what organizations the girls
represented. The judges were
rating the girls on what they saw,
and not on the organizations
which they represented.

Mary Mencer did NOT have to
withdraw her name from
competition or resign as
Co-chairman of Homecoming.
Mary Mencer had absolutely
NOTHING to do with the
planning and execution of the
Queen Contest. Mary Mencer
deserved the title of Homecoming
Queen 1968 because she fulfilled
every single requirement that the
judges were rating upon. Mary
Mencer scored a great deal higher
on both evenings of competition
than any other girl in the contest.

Any girl or judge of the Queen
Contest will tell you that the
entire contest was managed with
the utmost taste, dignity. and
style. 1 pride myself when I say
that no other event on this
campus has ever had as much
“class” as this contest had.

If there are any more questions
which arise concerning the Queen
Contest or any other Special
Events Board function, please feel
free to come to any Special
Events Board meeting.

Modern

 

Acadennc

 

FuncUon

 

A modern function of the university is the
training of people to meet immediate social
problems. One of the most pressing problems today
is the plight of the lower socio-economic classes in

our nation's cities and rural areas.

Although in the State University system there are

schools, like Old Westbury, that

courses on the social problems of our society, there
is no reason why the other branches, especially the
University Centers, cannot institute a lower level
course that will survey the problems of the lower

socioeconomic classes.

The university is usually the place where students
ﬁrst question the values and practices if their
society. it is that place of learning that should

provide answers to those questions.

TAKE OVER?

To the Editor:

1 am dismayed by the recent
alliance of several student radical
groups for the avowed purpose of
getting control of the student
government (Albany Student
Press, October 18).

It seems, from events this
summer concerning the tenure
committee, that leftist elements
wish to use student institutions
as a base from which to force
wide change in the academic
structure of the university itself.

But even now the faculty is
admitting students voluntarily to
various councils of Faculty
Senate, and I hope Central
Council will appoint intelligent,
thoughtful persons to thescoosts.

We ought to have a voice in the
academic direction of the
University, but I believe we
should leave control to those who
have the professional training,
levelhcadedness, and long
connection with the University
which can he the only adequate
preparation for this responsibility.

The combination of our rather
progressive faculty and mostly
quiescent and conservative
student enrollment is not fertile
ground for another Columbia. But
if the radicals do manage to get a
majority on Central Council, the
present Council and that just out
of office will be much to blame.

it has tightened up the
mech ‘ cs of the election
procedure (only after corruption

however); but it has done nothing

The Right Way

by Robert lee-en

 

ACK on!

 

By lU‘lCll MCGUBR

 

The following story was told by
ABC news commentator, Paul
Ha‘r‘yig" was too small to be a
ﬁghter, but he was a ﬁghter.

The boy weighed a scant 96
pounds. The Y.M.C.A. sponsors of
the Golden Gloves Tournament
said there were no other entrants
in the paperweight or ﬁyweight
divisions.

If he insisted on ﬁghting, he‘d
have to ﬁght boys 30 pounds
heavier than he. He insisted. Frail
as he appeared, the lad had a
wallop in either hand and a
natural boxing skill.

He fought larger contestants
in his hometown and was crowned
its champion. He fought his way,
three and four ﬁghts a night,
through the preliminaries,
semi-finals, into the state finals.

The slight youth, his name was
George, was "edgy" before the
main event. His coach, J.P. Hanks
invited the led to go for a walk to
"discuss strategy.”

Fist Fight

They’d walked about a block
from the "Y" dormitories when
they encountered a street fight.
Two young hoodlums were
pestering a small Negro boy.

This was a “tough” district in
those days. Besides, most boxers
will run from a street fight. Coach
Hanks grabbed young George by
the arm and tried to turn him
away from the row. But George
jerked his arm free and stepped
into the altercation. He ordered
the two hoodlums to leave the
Negro boy alone.

OnHiinaclt

Both hooligans were much
larger than George and the larger
of the two threw a punch without

warning. In an instant, George was
ﬂat on his back and on the
sidewalk. In another instant he
was on his feet dazed but fighting
triad. He waded toward the two
toughs. The ﬁrst curled over from
a pile-driver punch to the stomach
and an uppercut to the jaw. The
second was staggered by a volley
of blows to the middle then
ﬁnished with a broken nose.

Coach Hanks remembers there
was no need for him to help.
Diminuative George had knocked
two light-heavyweight toughs
unconcious within less than one
minute!!

Split Knuckles

“Your hands," couch Hanks
screamed. But it was too late. The
boys knuckles were split and
bleeding, his wrists were swelling.
And the next day was the
championship ﬁght for which he
had planned and dreamed and
trained since his earliest
recollection. He refused to see a
doctor, knew he would be

disqualiﬁed. By ﬁght night.
George’s hands were twice their
normal size. So painful there was
blood on his lips when the coach
had ﬁnished lacing his gloves. He
insisted on ﬁghting, Coach Hanks
remembers. “He could barely
defend himself, nothing more. He
lost that night, but I keep
remembering how and why he'd
won---the night before.

Brotherly Love

As I conﬁrmed these details
with Coach Hanks and with
newspaper accounts of the
incident, I kept wondering how
many persons, now giving
lip-service to brotherly love...I
kept wondering how many of
them, then or now, without
fanfare or photographers, would
pay such a personal price to
rescue a Negro boy he never
knew... as did that boy in
Montgomery in 1935. That boy,
George Wallace, grew up to
be Governor of Alabama.

Food Service, who the hell do you
think you are? Several people
have had their food cards,
conﬁscated because they gave
away some of their daily
allotment of food. This is unjust.
Food Service, you rule that we
may not transfer our cards to
others, that is unfair, but it is
YOUR business. But what we do
after we get the food is OUR
business! Remember that!
on

Soon it will probably be
proposed that no part of the meal
will be transferable. If this
happens, our best course of action
would be to make a clean break
with Food Service, and embrace
the cheaper, more efficient, better
testing services of SOGA.

us

So far this year, not many
students have been stricken by
food poisoning; come on Food
Service, get with it.

Why is everyone afraid to care?
Why need there be such a word as
apathy?

College students are touted by
the mass media as being the most
involved group of people in our
country. This generalization
ﬂutters most college students.

The case against personal
involvmcnt today is very strong;
apathy has a very good raison

pledged to do. A good place to
start would be to increase popular
representation on the Council
And the point. should be clear to
candidates for Central Council
seats—they must tell us out here
what they think, so we can have a
real choice; and they must not
stop thinking once they are
elected.

BEER HOURS

To the Editor:

i am writing this latter to
question the inane poIiCics
concerning the so called

Rathskeller in the Campus Center.
To me there is nothing more
frustrating than coming back from
a date and finding our “beautiful”
new ltnthskeller closed at 11:30.
Why 11:30 of all times; Perhaps
it’s because people go to bed early
on Friday. However, I doubt that
this is the case. In fact, the
"Rathskcller" does a land office
business on Friday nights. Why

12 :30 or so?

Another problem is the waiting
line to get beer. The entire
procedure for getting beer is time
consuming and leaves much to be
desired. To get one beer, a student
must 1) wait in line; .9.) present
ID. card; '3) fork over .25; i) get
receipt from cash register; 5) get
bcer mug; 6) present receipt and
mug to the “beer man"; 7) get
one louscy glass of beer.
Meanwhile, the people are
"floating" in and out returning
their mugs and demanding their
l.D.'s back. The result is
confusion and long waiting lines.
All this is totally unnecessary,

The cog in thc machinary is the
necessity to present your 1.1). card
for collateral for a mug. i ask you,
who the hell would want to steal
om.I of those gross, ugly things
anyway? Wouldn‘t it be much
simpler just to pay a quarter and
get some beer?

Phil Huggerty ‘71

Quite often, to be involved
means to be hurt. When an
individual is hurt, he receives
negative reinforcement for the
formation of apathetic behavior
patterns. Hence, most people
eventually decide to do only that
which benefits them directly.

By the laws of Nature, this
represents a means of
self-preservation; a very laudable
idea. This isn‘t the only method
though.

Has everyone tried to exist by
himself? Can it be done?

The people of Latin heritage
have (or did have) an eminently
more successful way of surviving;
they share the good and the bad.

People try to explain their lack
of involvmcnt by their past hurts.
This explanation fails when you
consider what total involvment
means. Shared happiness becomes
happier, and shared sadness
becomes less and.

When you try, and fail at your
ﬁrst attempt. you can only
withdraw with a twisted and bent
viewpoint of the world. This
results in the
prejudices and the closing of the

If you stick with it you receive

happiness. It is not only yours,
but it is a greater joy; a shared
joy. Science tells us that Man is a
social animal; when we admit this
and share our experiences, life
becomes more livable.

Living offers us (repeatedly) a
chance to prove our humanity. All
we need do is care for each other.
We get an inﬁnite number of
chances; the more we take, the
more human we become.

Since we are the product of our
experiences, we should continue
to experience everything. If we
withdraw after badness, we help
perpetuate baldness. By continuing
our involvment, we improve the
strain of our humanity.
