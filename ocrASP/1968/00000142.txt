not only displays a Bunuelian
anarchism; he is, in “Weekend,”
moving recklessly close to a

deliberate shock effects, its theme
of life's absurdity, its dreamlike
ﬂow, the mysterious, grotesque
imagery, the contortion and
eventual obliteration of time,
"Weekend’s " method is that ofa

“To overcome the horror of the
bougeoiaie, you need still more
horror." In the words of a
character in “Weekend” Jean
Luc-Godard posits the approach
and justification of his newest and
most startling film. From the first
frame to the last. greed, lust,
tapaciousness, perversion, and
violent death flash across the
screen with almost cynical
casualness. ln colors, voluptuous

heir nasty situations by means of
all sorts of manipulation of
audience values. For them, the
ultimate cynicism is to outrage
the spectator while you’re
entertaining him.

And really, there’s nothing in
"Weekend" that isn't implicit in
“Masculine Feminine,”
“Alphaville,” and "Deux ou ’I‘rois
Choses,..”; but paradoxically,
these themes of violence,
automation, sex, et al, take on a
range of overtones by being
placed in the narrower context of
a developing human situation.
"Weekend" has no situation; it's a
series of visions, some harrowing,
some uninteresting, connected by
thematic but not interpersonal
tissue.

But, see "Weekend." Where
Godard can go after this "film
found on a scrap heap...gone
astray in the cosmos,” I wouldn’t
dare say. But how appropriate,
that one of the moat nihilistic
ﬁlms ever made closes with the
words, "End of Story...End of
Cinema."

   

, Baum ann’s ‘Habitat’

Stands In Library

"Habitat", a moving

’ mechanized sculpture composed

of acrylic plastic, by Carl
Baumann was purchased by the
University in February of 1968.
Baumann was inspired by the
Habitat at Canada's Expo '67.
Baumann says of this work, "I
was thinking of some futuristic
community in space. I formed the
piece in a spiral for two reasons:
the genetic form of DNA, the
basis of life, is in a spiral, and the
spiral is aesthetically pleasing."
Baumann was born in 1926 and
has been interested in art since he
was a child, though he didn't call
it his true profession until 1963.
Having graduated from the
School of Architecture at
Syracuse University, and having

Penny Lang

To Perform
11 Campus

Next week the Coffee Hon.
Circuit will present the second in
its series of performers. Penny
Lang, accompanied by Don
Audits and Frank Hioblich, has
played the circuit for five years at
notable places like the Bitter End,
Gude's Folk City and two
consecutive years at the
Philadelphia Folk Festival.

Her material consists of folk
and blues with a major emphasis
upon unknown contemporary
writers. Among the artists she
cites as influential in her style are
Bob Gibson. Buffy St. Marie '

Penny Lang will be appearing
on the coffee house circuit from
Monday October 28 until
Saturday Nov. 2. There will be
two shows nightly at B and 9:30
Monday through ’I‘hrusday and
three shows at 8, 9:30 and 11 on
Friday and Saturday.

done graduate work there from
1960-1962, Baumann is very
interested in art and its various
applications.

“I am fascinated by the areas in

between; between art and
architecture, between art and
science, between art and

philosophy and religion. I am
fascinated by the edge which both
separates and holds together the
two sides of the coin—the light
between day and night—the
twilight zone."

The model for the sculpture,
"Box Fugue," stands in his studio.
The actual size of the work is 20
feet by 4 feet and can be seen in
the new Civil Service Employee’s
Association Building on Elk Street
in Albany.

Baumann feels that “abstract
visual art should be looked at the
way music, which is also an
abstraction, is listened to. It
should be judged by what it is,
rather than by what it is supposed
to be. "

He is presently working on a
sculpture called “Growth
