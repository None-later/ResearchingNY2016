DESPITE SCORING FOUR impressive goals,

"Whitetail
the Albany State

 

Lacrosse Club was unable to overcome Union’s tough varsity squad.

Lacrosse Club Drops

Match With

Under the direction of coaches
Joseph Silvey and John Morgan,
the Albany State Lacrosse Club
has been active this fall in
teaching new man the techniques
of the game.

For the past three weeks,
interested men, both upperclass
and freshman, have been working
out, learning the approaches to
this new game. The Albnay
mentors have used the philosophy
of "learning by doing" in the
teaching of the game.

Fundamentals such as catching,
throwing, scooping, and shooting
have been stressed, using last
year’s veterans as examples.
Strong physical workouts have
not been stressed because there is
no fall schedule for lacrosse.
Other aspects of the game have
been highlighted by controlled
scrimmages.

Last Saturday, about thirty
players journeyed to Union where
the Albany club was pitted against
Union's combined freshmen and
varsity teams. The controlled

Union 8-4

scrimmage game was proposed as
a learning experience, but this
idea was hampered due to wet
weather, a muddy ﬁeld, and no
spiked shoes for the Albany men.

Albany was the first to score
with Bruce Sand putting the ball
in the net with only about a
minute gone in the first period.
Sand received an assit from
Jakaway, but this was Albany's
only high performance play as
Union stormed back and the
churned field became increasingly
muddy.

Aill members of the team played
often as coach Silveyaguve many
players their first opwtunity to
tast lacrosse action. The final
score was Union 8, Albany 4, with
Jakaway Barlotta and Turow also
scoring Albany goals.

This spring, the Lacrosse Club
has its work cut out for it, as
schedulpq oppositon includes
Army, Harwich, and Castleton, all
varsity organizations. Practice will
continue until November. with a
tentative rematch with Union
slated for this Saturday morning.

Waterbury Defeats UF S

Waterbury Hail and UFS met
Tuesday in a game which,
although it did not drastically
alter the league standings,
hpparently meant quite "bit to
both teams.

UFS received, but on their
second play from scrimmage,
quarterback Denny Richardson’s
pass was alcrtly intercepted by
Barry Friedman of Waterbury.
The men from downtown, getting
the hall deep in UFS territory
could not score, UFS taking over
on downs. They did not hold onto
the ball long, however. as a bad

Waterbury received the free
kick and promptly registered a
touchdown on a long pass from
quarterback Pete Monte to split

end Dave Kutel. Waterbury now
led 10-0. UFS did not give up,
bouncing right back with a bomb
of thtir own from quarterback
Richardson to Bob Yusko, thus
putting UFS back in the game,
10-6 at half time.

The second half showed both
teams unable to sustain a drive,
the only scoring being a safety
against UF‘S leaving the filial score
Waterbury 12, UFS 6.

 

snap from center flew over
Richardson’s head and out of the
end zone for a safety. Thus,
Waterbury led 2-0 at the end of
the first quarter,

The ball changed hands three
times before Waterbury drove
deep into UFS territory. UFS held
on their own three yard line and
not being able to mount a drive,
attempted a punt from their own
and zone. The kick was blocked
and was fallen on by a big
Waterbury lineman for a safety,
upping their lead to 4-0.

try Ru‘n. will be held Saturday afternoon

on the State University at Albany campus. Approximately 260 runners representing some 30 teams are
expected to compete in three divisions. The junior college race will start at 12:30, the‘freshman at 1:10 and
the varsity at 1:50. The ﬁrst two races will be on the 3.5 mile course with the varisty on the ﬁve mile

COUI’SB.

Defending varsity champion Springﬁeld College, which swept the ﬁrst six places last year, will be favored
to repeat, but not as easily. Four of those six men, including three of the ﬁve who tied for ﬁrst, are

returning.

Roland Cormier, Ken Klatks,
and Bill Tramposch set the course
record of 26:51 a year ago when
they and two now-graduated
teammates ﬁnished hand in hand.
Steve Smoth, another teammate,
followed them across.

Lou Ruggiero of Boston State
was seventh and Al Pastore of
Oneonta eighth in the 1967 race,
and both will be back Saturday.
Another Oneonta standout, Jim
Dever, missed last fall's event with
illness, but should figure
prominently this time. He has
won 40 of 44 collegiate meets,
including. 10 straight, and has a
4 :20 mile to his credit.

The man to beat, however, may
well be Ron Stonitsch, a
sophomore from CW, Post. Ron
won the freshinan event last year
in the course record time of 17’42
and never has been beaten in
freshman or varsity collegiate
competition.

Host Albany’s top four men,
Lorry Frederick, Pat Gepfert, Paul
Raoy, and Don Beevers, have the
potential to push the leaders.
Great Dane coach Bob Munsey
who is coordinating the meet,
feels certain that, given good
weather, the course record will be
broken Saturday.

Looking briefly at the varsity
teams, Springfield has lost to Holy
Cross and the University of
Connecticut this fall, but has the

 

depth to rate the favorites role.
Four teams figure to battle the
Indians for the top slot, CW. Post
(8-0), Oneonta (7-1), Boston State
(7-3), and Albany (6-2). Oti er
entries include Siena, Trenton
State, Plattsburgh, Potsdam,
Stony Brook, and possibly
Rochester . Tech and Bentley

(Mass) College.

Albany’s Dennis Hackett,
unbeaten in six duals meets this
year, has a shot at individual
honors in the freshman meet. The
Dane pups are 3—3. Most of the
freshman teams will come from
the same colleges as the varsity
entrants.

STUDENT TAX NOW MANDATORY

by Doris Steinhsrdt

The mandatory payment of Student Tax was passed in

last week's elections by a vote of 826 to 609. Terry
Mathias, Vice-President of Student Association, naturally
expressed pleasure at the outcome and also at the number
of students who turned out to vote.

In the elections of May 1, 2, and 3, 1968, 434 students
went to the polls, as compared with 1444 who voted this

fall.

Mathias stated that the next step is to finalize the
procedures for collection of the tax. Planning that has
been going on for the past three weeks is now nearing

completion.

There will also be a small reduction in the price of the
Student 'I‘ax Card, but Mathias hopes that the reduction

can be made larger.

In the case of a student in extreme ﬁnancial need, the
student fee will either be waived or reduced. The ﬁnal
decision is now in the hands of the Financial Aids Ofﬁce.

 
 

Two additional measures will increase income to the
Student Association. Members of the faculty can purchase
tax cards (on a voluntary basis, of course), and the card
will be transferrabie for the purchaser's entire family.

There will also be a married students' tax card. If both
spouses are students at the University, they will be
entitled to a reduction in Student Tax. If one spouse is a
student here and purchases a tax card, the other spouse
may also purchase a card, but at an increased rate.

Mathias also said, “l’d like to thank all the people who
worked on the election, all the election assistant: who
worked at the polls, and all the students who came out to
vote.“ He also stated that the number voting “shows that
the students are beginning to care about their elections
and indicates a change in the feeling of the student body.”

Also last week, the following students were elected to
seats on Central Council: from State Quad, Edward Weim

and Lynn.Wllson; from Dutch Quad, Douglas

 

Goldschmidt and Nancy Masher; from Alumni Quad,
Gregory Spear and Kenneth Stokem; and from
commuters, David Cummings and Suzi Goldmacher.

Elected to LAAC were: Susan Bryan, Claudette
Ouiment, Lynn Wilson, and Frann Wolfe from State
Quad; Robert Buntein, Mare Rosenberg, and Kenneth
Stokem from ‘Alumni Quad; and Michael Cohen, Carl
Shapiro, and Andrew Zambelli of the commuters.

Voting for presidential preference: was as follow:
Humphrey—298; Nixon-433; Wallace-d4. "No" vote.
totalled 256. Among senatorial preferences, the voting
was: O'Dwyer-<307; Javita--293; Buckley—52. The number
of "no" votes was 33.

On the Pueblo issue, 422 students voted "yes," while
232 voted "no." This was not considered passed, however,
since the necessary 10% of the student body did not
express an opinion on the issue.

in a question period that

comrades cared only about getting
out of the war alive, 25% were
firme opposed to the war and the
reminder were military men in

He added that 86% of the Gl's

concluded that such poor military

The slides showed the meaning
of existence in Vietnam-- platoon
movements, fire support bases in

“Slides can’t convey the sound

veteran. “Movies have no

The major aim of the program
is to provide each student with
the opportunity to earn a college
degree. Students applying for
admission were recruited from all
parts of the state with the help of

school and civic groups and
University staff members.
in September, Dr. Harry

Hamilton, assistant professor of
atmospheric science, assumed the
post of director of the program,
with Robert Shostak named as
associate director.

Admission requirements were
modified by the University to
take into account the background
of the students, since many
possessed some educational or
cultural deficiencies. Also,

been on a different social level

students, such as a willingness to

personality assets as well as

The same academic regulations
that apply to all University
students also apply to those in the
program. They are considered
full-time students of the Class of

load, but only during their ﬁrst
semester.

Throughout the year, some
students will require support

Record”

President,

Nixon feels that the country
cannot afford four more years r‘f
Democratic rule. with Vice
President Humphrey mmunan
on with Johnson Administration
poiicres,

in mentioning the Pueblo
incident, Nixon made it clear that
it is time for a change. He charged
that present government cannot
cope with a “fourth rate nation,"

as North Korea, and returh
American soldiers to their
country.

He proposed a new foreign
policy that would end the war in
Vietnam and prevent future wars
of that kind.

Nixon stated that the US
cannot and should not carry the
heavy responsibilities in the world
that it now carries. He feels that
the other countries of the world
should share the responsibilities,
and this would bring the US new
respect.

If elected President, Nixon
believes he can bring law and
order to the country by forming a
new academy that will teach
police officers better methods of
law enforcement and by waging
an all out war against crime in the
US.

Nixon talked briefly about
social security benefits, telling the
people that in his administration,
as prices go up, so will social
security.

However, he believes that he
can stop the inflation that is now
taking place and also stop the rise
in prices of material goods so that
a dollar earned today will buy the
same amount of goods five years
from now.

In dealing with the issue of
education, Nixon mentioned that
he would create a new program
that would improve the quality
and increase the quantity of
education, and also raise the
teacher’s salaries.

Under a Nixon administration,
students who disobey university
authority would not be allowed to
attend the university.

He belieVes young Americans
want a change and can get a
change because it is not the
society that has failed but it is the
Administration that has failed.
