Four men spoke, before an
audience of forty-five on the
subject of Executive Control of
US Foreign Policy. The first
meeting of Vanity Debate
Council was called to order by
Mia Jeanine Rind director of

Forensic Activities.
The speakers for the
sf ﬁrmstive were Bill Rohde,

president of the group, and Doug
Goldschmidt. Defending the
negative point of view was
Stratton Rawson and Torn
Cervone, secretary-treasurer of the
club.

Rohde opened the debate by
deﬁning the terms of the issue and
by establishing the framework of

his approach to curtailing
executive control of foreign
policy.

Cervone, first speaker for the
negative, opened his speech in e
lighter vein, and was immediately
met with the applause of all
present. Shortly before closing, he
assumed the role of a magician
and made the affirmative’s
arguement disappear, again to the
applause and laughter of the
audience.

Gesturing enthusiastically,
Goldschmidt continued the
defense of the affirmative point of
view. To supplement his speech,
he drew a chart on the blackboard
to show the discrepancy between
executive and legislative control
of foreign oolicv. “9 enfomed
Rohde's outline for limiting
executive control by listing a
series of pertinent examples.

Rawson, speaking for the
negative team, continued in the
humorous mood established by
his partner Cervone. Speculating
on the foreign policy which might
be used in World War 111, he

erased Goldschmidt‘s chart,
arousing laughter from the
audience.

’ After a five minute

intermission, both sides presented
their rebuttals, the negative side
amused the audience with a series
of humorous poems relevant to
the debate.'The poems carried out
the fairy tale metaphor, and
appeared to be spontaneous. The
affirmative side approached the
rebuttal more seriously

The next Varsity Council
Debate will be held on
Wednesday, November 6, at 8:00
p.m. in the Campus Center

Ballroom.
The question for the evening

will be “Is the state responsible
for the economic and social
welfare of the citizens?"

Quebec
Closes

Over 40,000 CEGEP students
were out of classes Tuesday Oct
15 as the Quebec student
revolution entered its second
week.

Ten schools are in student
hands, eight more closed for strike
votes and study sessions to
recommend further action. Only
five of the junior colleges are
operating normally.

The University of Montreal's
8,000 students are boycotting
classes and occupying major
buildings. The Laval University
institute of Technology is shut
down by 2,000 students. Private
colleges around the
French-speaking province are
closed in sympathy: Loyola
College, Sir George Williams
University and McGill University
are holding study sessions or
sympathy marches Tuesday or
Wednesday.

The rumblings from French
Canadian students, which began a
week ago in Ste. Therese, a small
village 15 miles north of Montreal,

have become an avalanche, as
students have decided that taking
over their schools is the only way
to make their grievances heard.

LBJ To Conduct Seminar

Series At Rice University

By PRESTON KIRK

HOUSTON (UPI) - Rice
University, a private liberal-
arts college with a curriculum
accented on science, announced
Monday President Johnson
would conduct a series of
political science seminars after
he leaves office next year.

Dr. Joseph Cooper, chairman
of the political science depart-
ment, said dates for the
seminars would be announced
later, but that Johnson had
accepted the university's invita-
tion in a communication which
said:

“At this time is is difficult to
arrange a schedule and to
decide on the format of my
visits with you. Rest assured,
howevsr, that l gladly accept
your invitation."

Cooper said the seminars
would be in the spring.

Johnson has indicated before
he will return to the teaching
career he pursued before he

entered politics after he leaves
the presidency.

He gaught in Houston for two
years, in 1930 and 1931, at Sam
Houston High School before
leaving to become secretary to
Texas Congressman Richard M.
Kieberg.

Johnson became successively
a congressman, senator, Senate
majority leader, vice president
and President in the days since
he taught speech at Sam
Houston and coached its state
championship debate team.

Rice is in south liouston
across from the Texas Medical
Center, where Dr. Danton A.
Cooley and his famed surgeons’
team have done many of the

United States’
plants.

Professionel, and is the Quebec
school system's equivalent of a
junior college or trade school, a
step between high school and the
university or trade school. The
CEGEP system is the first phase
of a massive overhaul planned for
the Quebec educational system.
The CEGEP’s are in severe
trouble now, as student grievances
which have been smoldering for
more than a year come to the
surface. The students' major
demand is for a second
French-langUage university; more
than 60 per cent of CEGEP
graduates cannot now attend a
university for lack of space.

Quebec's Education Minister,
Jean—Guy Cardinal, promised
Saturday that a second French
language university will open in
Montreal in September 1969.

But the student's grievances go
beyond the university issue. They
are also fighting to reorganize the
chaotic administration of
CEGEPs. At Lionel Groulx in Ste.
Therese, student union leaders
told of the disorganization of class
schedules and courses. Arbitrary
cancellation of classes was so
commonplace, they said, that one
student was told that ten of his 17
courses no longer extended.

The students also want an
increase in scholarships and loans,
aboliton of a recently enacted 2
per cent interest hike on student
loans, and planned employment
for CEGEP graduates.

To the charge of disorganized
administration, Cardinal was not
so sympathetic; he expressed
disapproval of "confrontation'.
tactics and said he would support
any action, short of calling in the
police, initiated by CEGEP
administrators to regain control of
their school.

Earlier in the strike the school
administrators had expressed
emotions ranging
indifference to disgust.

Perlmutter Returns

From Bill Signing

0. William Perlmutter, dean of
the College of Arts and Sciences,
has returned to the campus from
Washington where he attended by
invitation the signing of the
Higher Education Bill and the
Vocational Education Act by
President Johnson in the East
Room of the White House.

Witnesses included the
Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare, Wilbur Cohen, and
an estimated 200 other leaders in
education from throughout the
country.

The Vocational Education Act
is a program of grants and
contracts to United States public
and private agencies and
institutions to further research
and training in vocational
education and to conduct
experimental and demonstration
programs to meet special
vocational needs of new careers
and occupations.

Student Revolution
Universities

L‘Union Generale des Etudiants

de Quebec, which has lent
whole-hearted support to the
strike, will hold

coordinating committee meeting
Thursday evening to plan future
action. The meeting was called
last week to allow each school’s
executive to sound out students.
(The revolt is probably the most
democratically-run in the history
of student activism. UGEQ has
refused to take action until every
student in the system has made
his voice heard. Each CEGEP has
taken a strike vote before taking
action. Last week five of the
junior colleges voted speciﬁcally
not to strike, and this week
remain the only schools in
session.)

Indications now are that UGEC
will call a general student strike
throughout the provice if the
government takes no action
before Thursday.

Earlier in the month Dean
Perlmutter participated in the
Ford Foundation Teacher Corps
Think Conference held in
Washington at the Sterling
Institute. Tentative plans were
made for the preparation of a new
group of teachers to go into inner
city schools and for the
recruitment of the most dedicated
people for the task.

Starting in November there will
be a series of meetings throughout

the country during the next six
months. Working cooperatively
will be universities, school
systems, communities, schools of
education, and other facilities.

Attending the conference were
academic researchers involved in
creating new concepts, senior
school system administrators with
responsibility for administration
of the programs at the operating
level, academic deans with
responsibility for administering
university teacher training
programs, and Teacher Corps field
directors responsible for
developing and testing Teacher
Corps programs over the past two
years.

Dean Perlmutter has been
active in plans for the Peace
Corps, the Job Corps, and the

a central TEacher Corps.

The statement which was in last
week’s ASP which said that “The
statement on the back of the meal
card which says that the meal card
is non-transferrable is to mean
that the meals or any part of them
are non‘transferrable, whether in
the contracting studenls' absence
or presence." has not taken effect
yet.

This statement was referred to
committee to look into the
possible legal ramifications. It was
thought that this interpretation
might be a violation of the

H H H Predicts Nixon Defeat

By United Press international
Richard M. Nixon pleaded
Monday with the natio 's voters
for “more than a plurality of
popular support.“ His former
boss, Dwight D. Eisenhower,
agreed that “the size of the

victory will be of great
importance to the future of our
country."

Meantime, there were predic-
tions from Gov. Harold E.
Hughes of Iowa and a

Democratic leader in California
that Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy
would soon endorse Humphrey.
McCarthy, who was placed in
nomination at the Democratic
National Convention by Hughes,
has refused so far to back the
vice president.

ixon, campaigning in New
York and Pennsylvania, told an
Albany audience he would need
“more than a plurality of
popular support" to heal dccp
national ruptures.

American generation known so

The students were divided into
several groups upon admission to
the program, each group receiving
the necessary counseling and
developmental work needed to
begin acutal college life.

The first group, composed
mostly of students from the
Albany-Troy Schenectady area,
lived on campus from June 28
through August 9. The students
received special courses in
developmental English, math and
reading.

The second group of lity-cight
students included about forty
studean recruited from Job Corps
Centers around the nation. They
resided on campus from August 4
to September 9, and took courses
similar to the first gr- 'up.

Thirty-five students,
constituting a third group, were
admitted through EOl‘, but
presented credentials very similar
to those in the freshman class.
Therefore, although they attended
one of the Summer Planning
Conferences, they took no
developmental courses,

’l'hirty students, composing tin-
fourth group, are residing at the

University and are presently
taking one or two developmental
courses. They will lwgiu actual
classes next semester. The

program, l'irsl begun as the (filling:-

through the actions of the Faculty

Alliance, the program was

time," Nixon said. “Violence
and fear are becoming the
hallmarks of our national life,"
in a letter to Nixon,
Eisenhower expressed his rc—
grct that his health had
prevented him from campaign-
mg for Nixon. He said he hoped
for a big Republican victory.

“A strong, clear mandate—
hopefully including a Republican
Congress“ would enable Nixon
to "deal with dissension and
lawlessnew at home" at well as
with Vietnam and other prob-
lems, the former president said.

Third party candidate George
C. Wallace attacked the news
media and public opinion polls
during a speech to 3,000 persons
in Hannibal, Mo.

Predicting he would win the
election, Wallace said, “One
reason we are going to win it is
that the people of this country
are tired of a few anarchists
running it.”

Curtis E. LeMay—Wallace ‘5
running mate said in Des
.Moincs that the nation has

drifted so close to socialism and
communism that If a conserva-

tive administration is not
elected Nov. 5 “we may not
ever get another chance."

LeMay charged, too, that the
Johnson administration has
"forbidden" US. military forces
to win the war in Vietnam.
Edmund S. Muskie— llum-
phrey's running mate shared his
leader‘s optimism. He said the

picked up so much momentum
it was like “the difference

Wadlow Hoax
Scores Defrauded

Did anyone see Robert Wadlow
at 12:00 pm. on Oct. 23'? Well, if
you didn‘t, you aren’t alone. The
appearance of Robert Wadlow,
the eight foot, nine-and-a-haif
inch giant, was a hoax.

it began as a trivia joke of
perpetrators. Just for curiosity,
they conducted a small and
somewhat organized campaign to
500 how many people would come
out to view the giant.

The campaign consisted of
100450 small signs announcing
his appearance on chncsduy at
12 noon. Also, there were three
large banners and three
announcements on \VSUA.

500 people in all came to see
him. There were usually about
200 at a time waiting for him.
Most waited on the outside stairs
of the Campus Center going down
In the Snack Bar. He was to

appear in the Campus Center
gardens.
The real story of Robert

Wadiow is ho was an eight foot,
nine and-u-haif inch man who had
a disfunctioning gland causing
giuntism. He died in July 1940 at
the age of 22 due to
complications of a foot infection.
