To the Editor:

I think that it is unfortunate
that what Mr. Rosenberg writes in
his articles can be easily
misconstrued and ‘ ‘----d
by the general reader.

The October 18 article is an
excellent example. It is my
interpretation that Mr.
Rosenberg’s statement that during
World War II Poland “joined the
victorious master eagerly” should
be taken in the entire context of
the article. Thus the above
statement does not mean that the
Poles welcomed a Nazi invasion
and domination of their
homeland, but that once the Nazis
were there to stay the Polish
people eagerly joinedthe master in
the extermination of Poland’s
three million Jews.

Poland had previously had a
long history of virulent and
vitriolic anti-Semitism. In the
early years of the Polish republic
(in the 1920's) there were horrible
massacres of Jews throughout the
country followed by a mass
attempt at exclusion of Jews from
business and commerce without
any new resulting employment
such as in agriculture. All of this
caused an incredible poverty—in a
number of cases even starvation.
These actions were condoned by
the government under such
anti-Semitic leaders as General
Pilsudski and Marshal Smigly, and
sanctioned by the Church as well.

It is reasonable to say that a

main factor in the Nazi
establishment of the main
concentration camps such as

Aushwitz and Treblinka for the
total liquidation of the Jews in
Poland, was the attitude of the
Polish people in general to the
Jews. Even the underground did
nothing to help the people such as
in the Warsaw ghetto. General
Bor- Komorowski’s army was
made up largely of the reactionary
and totally anti-Semitic National
Democrats, a major political party
of the period.

A classic example of the lack of
Polish help for the Jewish victims
is the Warsaw ghetto uprising. In
this Case, the Jewish partisans
received no material support from
the Polish government-in—exile, no
help from Komorowski and only a
bare amount from the Communist
underground. The Soviet Union
sent bags of grain by air which
broke when they hit the ground.
Their effort was nothing more
than a propaganda gesture.

There was another army in
Poland not even mentioned by
Mr. Pietrusza, Narodowe Sily
Zbrojne of the National Radicals
which has been strongly accused
of deliberately working with the
Nazis in the extermination of
Jews.

All this about Poland is not to,
say that other countries such as of
Eastern Europe did not aid in the

,whoiusale butchering of their
own. llumunia worked hard to
mend its million Jews to the gas

chambers. Today Rumania has a
thriving Jewish community with
18 synagogues in Bucharest alone.
Premier Ceausescu has given the
chief "L' ‘ virtual ‘

and allowed a practice of ritual.

In Poland, Premier Gomulka
and General Moczar, the Interior
minister are busy purging Jews
from various state controlled
professions. Recently, Ida
Kaminska the first lady of the
Yiddish theater announced that
her troupe, the State Yiddish
Theater of Poland was forcibly
disbanded signalling the end of
Yiddish theater in Eastern
Europe.

All this shows how Poland has
continued her vicious
anti-Semitism against a tiny,
helpless band of 80,000
remaining-l should say surviving
Jews while another communist
country has been able to shake it
off.

Even in Italy under Mussolini‘s
fascist rule, the Jewish
community under the leadership
of the late chief rabbis Angelo
Sacerdoti and lgnazio Zolli was
able at first to help escaping
German Jewish refugees and use
its working relationship with
Mussolini to get a lessening of
Nazi persecution in Germany in
the first few years of Hitler's reign
of terror. Later, during World War
11, facing deportation and possible
liquidation, Italian Jews were
hidden by their fellow
Italians—even by the Pope in the
Vatican. 1 know this because I
have relatives who were saved in
this way in Genoa by generous
and courageous neighbors.

Student government elections have, in the past,
followed a more or less standard procedure.
Candidates submit their names, put up their

Association

A dilemma arises when a Freshman or a transfer
student decides to run for ofﬁce. He has no
established backing, and knows too few people he
can pressure into voting as a bloc for him. In the
past, a candidate in a position like this would win
either because he had produced the most attractive
posters, or because his name was at the top of the

ballot.

If there has been one major failing of the
Student Government elections, it is the failure to
evoke discussion of the issues (which do exist).

students to whom they speak, Ihat they will work

ever mentions how or in what way he will do this.

residence halls, and all seemed at peace with the
University.
But at the same time, a minor revolt of sorts

was arisin . At State Quad, an area totally devoid
bree mlluencc, thirty six students had

indicated their willingness to serve in the capacity
of representative to either LAAC or Central
Council. In the interest of meaningful elections, it
was decided that the candidates should actually
confront their constituents. ‘

“And so it came to pass" that on the Tuesday
prior to elections the candidates were required to
state, in no uncertain terms, what they stood for.
To an audience of varying size (generally, 404d)
students) at various times, each candidate
espoused his beliefs. There was no great
controversy; all were in favor of abolishing
inequalities and creating new, exciting ideas.

But this is not the point. It is, rather, Ihal for
perhaps the ﬁrst time in years, candidates were
required to present their views to thc
electorate-they were subject to the questions of
their peers-and they had to make an effort to
clearly delineate their positions.

 

to the few

It is our belief that gatherings of this type are
fundamental to the creation of a meaningful
student government at this University. Let the
candidates state their views, and let the voters
choose. Only in this way can a student government
he a truly representative body. We urge all Quads
to follow the shining example of Stale Quad and
make their elections more meaningful.

This week is Election Week for
hundreds of State students. The
absentee ballots are in and the
votes will soon be tabulated.
Despite some evidence to the
:ontrary, this is a very crucial
election for New Yorkers.

There are candidates running
on every level who merit our
support. Some can be
unequivocally supported; others
can be endorsed with reservations.

The Presidential race offers no
real choice. Hubert Humphrey is
so clearly the superior candidate
that no further discussion is
necessary. The Senatorial contest
here is an exceptional one in that
both candidates are worthy of our
support. Paul O'Dwyer is the
more deserving of the two; he is
so pure a candidate that his
integrity is unchallenged even by
his opponents.

In Albany there can be little
debate. Congressman Dan Button,
Arnold Proskin, and the rest of
the Republican-AIM ticket are far
and away the better candidates.
Herzog, Scully, and the other
Democrats are remnants of a day
that has thankfully passed. They
should be beaten badly.

The most important
Congressional race in the nation is
the one in the Fifth District of
Long island (Oceanside-Long
Beach-Five Towns). Here Allard
Lowenstein is in a stiff race with
the Conservative party's Mason
Hampton.

Lowenstein’s election is
imperative. At thirty-nine. he is
already a national figure. He was
the prime mover in the "Dump
Johnson“ movement.

After a trip to Vietnam, Al
Lowenstein organized the
“Committee of Concerned
Democrats" which blossomed into
the Coalition for a Democratic
Alternative and ultimately into
the McCarthy-Kennedy
movement. James Wechsler says in
the “New York Post" that

1 THE no me

The ASP editorialized that if
the antiwar week were not a
success it would be because the
organizers had decided simply to
talk to themselves. The ASP based
its comment upon a fallacious
assumption: either the week
would be successful or the
organizers preferred to talk to
themselves. What actually
happened lies outside this fallcay.

We found that the majority of
the students, if they care about
anything, don't care about this
war at this time, Then we found a
tiny minority who care very much
about the war~in all the cliched
terms. it's a war to “stop 'om
somewhere," “for freedom," “to
defend the free world," "to
bolster our economy,“ “to keep
the rate of unemployment down."
We don’t worry about these
people; those who see war as a
periodic boost to the economy or
who don’t think beyond catch
phrases aren't worth the energy it
takes to argue with them.

We reached, therefore, a
relatively small layer of new
people whose minds were open,
who Were willing to consider new
information. In a Wily, getting to
these people is much like refining
U-ZIII’). A ton makes less than an

ounce, but with that ounce.... .
Those new people we brought to
listen to us found rewarding,
mind-expanding experiences.

On Monday they heard a
poetry reading; on 'l‘uesduy, David
Mclteynoids, on Wednesday, six
veterans; on Thursday,
discussions, films, including a slide
shown by a Vietnam vet;
Thursday eveneing, a talent show

Lowenstein did more than any
other individual to “set in motion
the sequence of events climaxed
by Mr. Johnson‘s formal
withdrawal."

Lowenstein is a remarkable
man. He has been president of the
NSA (in its pre-CIA days),
National chairman of “Students
for Stevenson," and foreign policy
assistant to Sen. Hubert
Humphrey.

Lowenstein has been Dean of
Stanford University. He spent
1963 in Mississippi defending civil
rights workers. He is
Vice-Chairman of the ADA and
on the board of SCLC. He spent
1967-68 dethroning the President
of the United States. Today he
runs for Congress.

He will probably lose. The
party leaders refuse to support
Lowenstein because he is not
campaigning for Humphrey. He
has said he will vote for the
Vice-President, but will do no
more.

So the party and the labor
unions are sitting on their
hands—and on their pocketbooks.
Lowenstein's other great problem
is that in his district Republicans

outnumber Democrats five to
four.
There is no Republican

candidate in the Fifth; however,
the Conservative Party‘s nominee
won GOP endorsement through
some back room deal. This Mason
Hampton is a founder of the
extremist pressure group that
callsfor a drastic cut in funds for
education, resumption of nuclear
testing, and the death of all gun
control bills: the Conservative
Party of New York.

He is a political mastodon; and
he is also the front-runner in the
contest.

However, Lowenstein can still
win. If students lescend on
Oceanside the way they once did
on Concord, Al Lowenstein can
still pull off a victory. A
Lowenstein defeat would mean

The following letter was
written to the students of various
colleges by the Special Committee
for the Making of an Intelligent
Choice, 1968.

The purpose of the Committee
was to facilitate understanding by
college voters about the choice
they should make next week:
Nixon or Humphrey. The letter
begins "Dear Students," and

 

 

On The Other Hand

by Tom Ceruone and Doug Goidschmidt

 

"Make the personal demand of
him?" The preceding command
was presented by the S.D.S., the
Y.S.A., and the Committee to
End the War. “If your professor
refuses,“ they say, “boycott the
class. . ." These ideas expressed in
a letter to the student body
requesting everyone‘s
participation in an end the war
week are a direct affrontory to
our intelligence and slur the
intellectual community.

As much as we remain opposed
to war, such antics are indicative
of hypocrisy and a clear lack of
reg ard for the rights of others

and for the integrity of the
University.

We do not oppose
demonstrations or antivwnr

activities, indeed, we support civil
disobedience and passive
resistance. We also support the
idea behind “End the War Week"
as activities like this are
desperately needed on campus.
But a demand can never be
justified.

For such brash demands could
easily come from a kindergarten
student demanding his rattle anti
threatening to throw a tantrum if
he doesn't receive it, or from a
little league team protesting a
decision and threatening to walk
off the field if things don't go
their way, but sound ludicrous in
a H ‘_,.

It is the professor's prerogative
to decide when and if he will
discuss the war. Student usurption

of power is a blatant display of
arrogance and self-righteousness.

A class may request that the
war be discussed, but it is
transgressing upon other students'
and the professor's rights to usurp
or demand.

This is but one example of the
general affrontory many of our
groups on campus have shown in
the past at demonstrations such as
the Dow and C.I.A., we assert that
students have no more right to
hinder these activities than the

University has to prohibit
speakers of dubious political
tendencies from appearing on
campus.

Our government‘s injustice

regarding minority groups and
foreign ethnic groups and the
alleged lack of justice in the war's
conduct are no more unjust than
student suppression of their
fellows, government agencies, and
professors.

The C.l.A.'s unjust actions are
no excuse for students acting
unjustly. Suppression by any
other name still smells the same.

Campus protest should embody
the basic ideology of the
University which is reason, justice,
and truth; and it should never
embody the basic ideology of
irresponsibility, irrationality, and
a disregard for a student’s
freedom to meet with any
recruiter, or to pursue his
academic life as he sees fit.

OBSERVATIONS

The United States in general,
and New York State specifically,
are headed in the direction of
developing a multiparty system.

In New York lbere are now
eslablishud Liberal and
(Tonservativv parties, and
candidates for various local offices
will run in different areas on slates
proposed by other parties.
Albany, for example, typifies this
with the problem of trying to fit
the names of all the candidates of
all the parties into the spam-s
provided on the voting machines.

In addition in this, the name of
(leorgc Wallace will appear on the
ballots of all 50 states. Ilnd
Eugene McCarthy not asked his
name withdrawn from the ballots
of several states, he also would
have represented another possible
choice for those going to the polls
on November 5. Senator
McCarthy's name will, none the
less, still be on the ballot in
Arizona and perhaps his home
state of Minnesota.

The trend away from the
choices offered by the two major
parties is further enhanced in
somn states by the possibility of
the write-in vote. This could be
significant this year in light of the
fact that in the states of Florida,

Texas, and California write-in
campaigns have been organized in
behalf of Senator McCarthy.

For those who bulivvv firmly in
tilt' two party system anti view
these events with dismay, it might
be well to look into possible
causes of this trend.

In his liiiirl campaign for the
Presidency, Barry Goldwater
claimed he would offer the
American people "a choice, not
an echo." Now many people feel
that the Republican and
Democratic parties are offering
nothing more than an echo,

liightly or wrongly, many do
think that it will make little or no
difference whether Richard Nixon
or llubert llumphrey occupies the
White House for the next four
years. They are seen as holding
similar vicws and probably
conducting like policies.

For whntevor reason, ‘Illtl
certainly there are many, the rise
of minor parties must be
considered a sign of dissatisfaction
with the major parties and their
alternatives or lack ofalturnutives.

’l‘hese parties presently
represent no more than small
minorities, but by the same token
these minorities apparently do
represent enough people in order

“It is our wish to remind you
that the”oft’tce of the Presidency
must be filled‘by a man who has
both raw ability and leadership
quality.

“By raw ability we mean a
President who can both conceive
of policy and produce it in the
form of concrete law or program.
By the quality of leadership, we
mean no concrete policy, but
rather a policy of mind, an art of
embracing greatness and idealism,
and an inspiration to national
unity. Both factors must be
inherent in the man who sits in
the White House.

“On this basis we conducted
two surveys ranking voter
opinions on a leadership quality
scale and an ability expectancy
scale. One survey was nationwide,
the other polled college voters.

“The college voters ranked
Humphrey high on the ability
scale but low on the leadership
scale. Nixon prOVed to be
mediocre on both indices.

“This was interesting because
the nationwide study showed
virtually the opposite: Nixon
ranked high on leadership quality
and roughly middle on the ability
scale; while Humphrey was
mediocre on both factors.

“This clearly meant that when
the nation says it wants “change,”
it means a change in the quality of
leadership, not so much in ability.
The college study showed that
those voters agreed with the
public on Humphrey's lack of
leadership, but disagreed on
whether Nixon could fill the
vacuum.

“With this crystallized we can
now suggest a way for students to
vote. They can vote for
Humphrey because his ability
expectancy is high; or they can
reconsider both candidates in
terms of leadership quality.

Then, when they balance the
Nixon leadership-plus with the
Humphrey ability-plus, they will
probably decide, along with this
Committee, that the best thing
they can do is write-in McCarthy,
or else stay home and watch the
whole mess on television."

that they manage to get on
various ballots.

As relatively small groups, they
also are usually nimble to elect
their candidates to public office.
What these parties have managed
to do, liowuver, has been to draw
enough support away from a given
major party candidate, so that in
the event of a close race they can
prevent the election of that

person.
The issue of multi-party
America raises interesting

questions and possible problems
for furture elections. Will plurality
rule replace majority rule‘.’ Or, if
majority rule is to be maintained
and minor parties continue to
grow, either in number or
strength, will the United States go
the way of the French Fifth
Republic, and go to a system of
run-off elections in the event no
candidate receives a majority?

The future is, at best,
uncertain. Perhaps minor parties
will continue to come and go, as
they have in the past. Perhaps, for
whatever reasons, these parties
will grow in strength. In either
event, they should be taken
seriously in the future of
American party politics.
