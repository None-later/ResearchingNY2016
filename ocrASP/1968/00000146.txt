‘Fifth Dimension’
Challenging Ideas

by Alan Luker

A challenge faces contemporary
music groups—to produce music
that not only stimulates but
activates its audience. “The Fifth
Dimension" accomplishes this
task and continually lives up to its
reputation of being a
distinguished musical group.

Last February, “The Fifth
Dimension" climbed the hierarchy
of the musical performing ladder
and attained a position as a top
vocal group. Their rendition of
"Up, Up and Away" won four
Grammy Awards from the
Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences for the Best Record of
the Year, Best Performance of a
Vocal Group. Best Contemporary
Single and Best Contemporary
Group Performance.

"The Fifth Dimension", before
combining their talents into one,
showed diversified interests

Marilyn McCoo‘s singing career,
“which began before she could
walk," was highlighted by her
appearance on Art Linkletter's
Talent Scouts when she was
ﬁfteen. The other female member,
Florence Larue, taught school
before joining the group. Both

females were beauty contest
winners. Ron Townson worked
his way through Lincoln

University by conducting school
and church choirs. Bill Davis Jr.
has sung with rock as well as
gospel groups. LaMonte
McLemore, one time professional
photographer, appeared in USO
shows.

Of all the "Fifth Dimension's"
selections, i feel few possess more
vitality than "Sweet Blindness."
The amazing resourcefulness of
the “Fifth Dimension“ is
demonstrated in this melody as
they develop a “bland.’ song into

Programming Commission
Offers Experimental Film

A 90-minute program of
experimental films will be
presented by Community
Programming Commission on
Nov. 3 at 8 pin Campus Center
Assembly Hall. Admission is
$1.50 without student tax and
$.50 with student tax.

The program, titled “Protest
and Politics," is one of an eight
part “Art and Document’. series
being offered to colleges and
universities by Bell & Howell
Company. According to a Bell 8:.
Howell spokesman, these films
which may not all be brilliant or
enduring, are provocative and
challenging to young Americans,
for whom film has become the
20th Century form of expression.

“Protest and Politics” offers a
variety of comment on the faults
of contemporary society, inviting
new interpretations of war,
prejudice, materialism and puritan

attitudes. Among the six ﬁlms
included in the program are
several which have won

internationalacclaim and awards in
such competitions as the Tokyo
International Film Festival, Expo
'67 and the Ann Arbor Film

Festival.

“Hey Stop That," by Robert
Feldman, uses a juxtaposition of
images to create an original and
compelling satire on bomb
shelters and _the armed forces.

“Not As Yet Decided," a 54
second masterpiece produced by
Jeff Dell, uses two small children
to make his compelling comment
on race hatred.

quintet combines versatility with
individuality to create a new
dimension in sound.

A live concert featuring “The
Fifth Dimension" would be
difficult to accomplish, but would
prove quite rewarding. The cost,
as would be expected, is high for a
group of this calibre. The only
means in which the University
could host such a group if they
lacked large enough indoor
facilities, is obviously to provide
for an outdoor concert in which
the capacity is unlimited.

R.S. Young

entitled, “To Kingdom ome.
The country air seeps through on
this song, which sort of brings you
back to life. "In A Station,"
next, is a masterful production of
a deep, very reflective,
introspective ballad, written and
sung by Richard Manuel. The final
twu songs on this side, are both
Robertson’s. “Caledonia Mission,"
demonstrates better than any
other song on the album the use
of an undercutting chorus, a
familiar building tool to the old
country artist. The ﬁnal number
on side one, is “The Weight,”
which was released as a single by a
Stax artist. it is one of the
grittiest songs I've ever heard. As
you listen, you can feel the days
of hardships, and the miles of
lonely roads that the Band must
have lived.

Side two of the album is not
just more of side one; it is another
experience each time one listens
to it. “We Can Talk," by Manuel,
is a song of the American way, a
modern ballad. “Long Black
Veil,“ is given a unique treatment,
as the Band seems to reminisce
the old days of sitting around and
singing because it was fun. The
next song, “Chest Fever,” written
by Robertson, demonstrates the
musical genius of the group. A
swelling organ overtakes your
senses, while in the meantime the
variety, and originality of the
band takes you to everything that
is new in music. "Lonesome
Suzie," written and sung by
Manuel, is touching, as a ballad of
a lost love. The final two
compositions christen the album
with greatness. The first, “This
Wheei‘s On Fire,” (Julie Driscoll
released it. as a single) is Dylan all
over, as is the final song, also
written by Dylan, “I Shall Be
Released."

And so you shall after listening
to “Music from the Big Pink."

Mike Barlotta of APA releases a pass against the 

 

Potter defense. The APAmen were victorious l9-6.

APA Defeats Potter,

Continues In First

by Dave Fink

Two games were played last
week which had an important
bearing on the League 1 standings.
Potter Club, usually a division
power, fell to APA 19-6, and
Tappan, making a strong bid for
the championship, defeated KB
9-0.

APA and Potter took the ﬁeld
on Thursday in what promised to
be a tough game due to the rivalry
that exists between the two clubs.
Such was not the case. Potter was
unable to move the ball
effectively. Their receivers could
not hang onto the ball the few
times quarterback Jim Waibel was
able to get it to them.

APA, on the other hand, put on
probably their ﬁnest offensive
show of the year. After being held
on their first drive, they moved
downfield seemingly at will. After
three completions from
quarterback Gary Torino to Bob
Wood and some fine running,
Torino arched a long touchdown
pass to tight end Danny Elkin for
the touchdown. APA led 7-0.

In the second quarter, Torino
again was on target. I-Iis fine
running and passing to flanker
Lance Brofsky and Wood resulted
in a touchdown when he found
Brofsky free in the end zone
making the score 13-0. An
interception by Jack Fairbank of
APA gave them the ball again and
Torino wasted no time to Wood,
who had again penetrated the
porous Potter secondary, for the
score.

A ﬁnal touchdown by Potter's
Danny Wykoff, making the final
score 19-6, iiverted the shutout
and was the first score allowed by
APA all year.

Tappan and KB met Saturday
with each team needing a win to
keep their title hopes alive.

The first Iialf was characterized
by both teams, while being able to

move the ball, not being able to
score. Tappan's ﬁne defense again
was led by Jim Alba, Craig
Kennedy, Jim Summerville, and
Lou Giordano. Sal Villa and Al
Zaremba were the standouts for
KB.

In the third quarter, after KB
received, Paul Remmick of
Tappan intercepted. The men
from State Quad scored in two
plays, a completion from
quarterback Cass Galka to George
Morgan followed by a fine off
takle run by Tony Tibaldi for the
score. On this play, a massive hole
was opened by Summerville and

Kennedy. A seventeen yard ﬁeld
goal late in the game made the
final score 9-0.

Booters Win Over Utica;
Drop Contest To R.I.T.

The Albany State soccer team registered both a victory and a defeat this past week as they defeated
Utica College 6-2 on Teusday and lost to Rochester institute of Technology on Saturday by a score of 3-0.
Albany's record now stands at two wins, five losses and one tie.

The soccer team‘s ﬁnal game is this Saturday as they travel to Stony Brook in search of their third win of

the season.

in registering a win over Utica, Alban was led b I0 homore Ron Spntt who

of scoring four times during the
game.
Ron was given the game ball for
his outstanding performance.
Albany completely dominated
the game as Utica never really
threatened until the outcome of

the game had already been
determined.

Spratt, who played at the
outside wing position, scored

three of his four goals in the
second half against the porous
Utica defense.

In Saturday ’8 game, Albany was
unable to generate a offense
which enabled them to soundly
defeat Utica. RIT refused to give
the Albany shooters an
opportunity to kick the ball into
the nets.

The defensive line of Albany,
however, was incapable of
preventing the Rochester forward
line from registering three scores.

Throughout the year, Albany
has been plagues with a somewhat
porous defense which has been
unable to prevent the opponents
from scoring. At the same time,
Albany’s offense has been unable
to generate a consistent scoring
ability.

While the offense has not been
able to score enough goals to
compensate for the lack of
defense, they have scored more
than last year’s squad.

The future of Albany’s team
might appear bright as Ron
Spratt, who scored four times in
one game will be returning as will
Ed Campbell, the starting center
forward. However, the freshman
squad will not be able to offer
much support as they have been
plagued by a general lack of
participation The Great Danes
travel to Stony Brook this
Saturday in hopes of gaining their
third win of the season.

participated in ii Regatta at Marist
College, Saturday, October 26.
Five schools were there, including

to be finished on Saturday. There
were no capsizes or major

protests. Albany’s biggest
contender was Msaarist,though we
led throughout the whole Regatta.
Alli ny ended the round robin
with five firsts and three seconds.
