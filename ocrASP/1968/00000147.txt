This year's cross-country team deserves a special note of praise for

the outstanding performances which it has turned in thus far.

Before the season began, it looked as if the harriers might be lacking

in depth as both Mike Attwell, last year's top varsity runner, and Don

Meyers, one of the leading freshmen, were no longer at Albany. Attwell

is spending the year in France, and Meyers transferred to Cortland.

In the ﬁrst meet of the season, the team did not look particularly

impressive as they lost to Coast Guard. However, with their victory over

Plattsburgli, the team developed a cohesiveness which has served to

mold them into a well-disciplined team.

 

Under the direction of Coach Munsey, the ltarriers have proven

themselves capable

of meeting a formidable opponent head-on with

no loss of prestige. In their Homecoming meet, the determination of

the runners was graphically illustrated. Both Don Beevcrs and Pat

Gepfcrt passed opponents in the ﬁnal 200 yards to barely squeeze out

the victory.

u

The second annual Albany Invitational further exempliﬁed the

runners‘ ﬁerce competitiveness. Although they were outpointcd by

Boston State whom they beat in a dual meet, the barriers were able to

overcome CW. Post who not only had the ﬁrst place winner, but also

had another runner in the ﬁrst ten ﬁnishers.

Coach Munsey and ctr-captains lion Beevcrs and George Rolling

deserve a commendation for their work in developing a well-dn‘crplined,

hard-working squad.

The ability of Coach

Munsey

to co-orditiate an effective

cross-country team is proven by his outstanding record since taking

over at Albany. This year, however, his accornplisltmerits are

particularly noteworthy.

Both Rolling and Bcevers have proven themselves very capable as

co-captains of the squad. While neither of them are the fastest runners

on the squad, they have the ability to demand and get the best

performances out of the runners on the team.

Certainly the cross-country squad and its coach, R. K. Munsey,

deserve a congratulation for their accomplishments thus far this year.

League I volleyball intramurals
opened play last Tuesday with six
out of eight teams showing up.
Irving defeated Livingston I two
out of two games and Alden I
beat Psi Gamma also two out of
two. Alden II and Livingston II
had been scheduled to play, but
were stood up by two Eastman
teams.

F-Troop, a combination of last
year‘s trophy-winning Brubacher
team, began their Intramural
season by beating Sigma Phi
Sigma Thursday at the lniation of
League II competition. The

Bleecker Bunnies, donning their
Easter bonneta, hopped their way
through volleyball poles and nets
to two straight defeats.

But not one can deny that they
have the spirit and character to
keep trying. The victors were a
patched up Eastman team.

In the same night, Schuyler
took two games in a row from an
enthusiastic Zenger team, and
Whitman downed Alden III in the
same way. The Whitman-Alden
game was a result of the absence
of two more Eastman teams. We
wonder what’s become of State
Quad Spirit.

There will be a meeting of
WA General Council Wednesday,

Third Place Finish For
Albany In Invitational

A powerful Springﬁeld team came back this Saturday to repeat as winners of the second annual Albany
Invitational Cross-Country Meet. In winning last year, Springﬁeld managed to capture the ﬁrst six places,
but this year the competition was somewhat stronger. Early in the race, Ron Stonitsch of CW. Post took
the lead and pulled far out in front of the trailing ﬁeld of high class runners.

Continuing his blistering pace, Stonitsch, who will be back next Saturday when Post runs Albany in a
dual meet, crossed the ﬁnish line in a course record time of 25:39, breaking the old record by a full 72

seconds. Trailing by nearly a
minute in second place was
Roland Cromier of Springﬁeld
who was joined by three of his
teammates in the top ten.

But Boston State, a team
Albany beat in a close meet two
weeks ago, provided stiff
competition as it too placed four
men in the top ten. Albany, in
what can be considered its finest
team effort of the year, ﬁnished
-third in the field of nine, with the
ﬁrst seven men all in the top 35
positions. The final score was
Springfield 29, Boston 49, Albany
88, and Post fourth at 110.

Larry Frederick, WIK‘ has been
continually imorovtng. was the
ﬁrst finisher for Albany and
eleventh in the meet. Ilis time of
27:20 was the best ever by an
Albany runner and he was lauded
by Coach R.K. Munsey for having
run “A Very Fine Race."

Following Frederick, to.
Albany, were Pat Gepfert 17th in
27:52, Don Beevers 18th in
27:53, George Rolling 20th in
28:03, and Paul Breslin 22nd in
28:10. These four provided a
good closo grouping and showed
vastly improved times from earlier
races. Munsey offered special
tribute to Paul Itoy who became
sick in the race and still managed
to come boot: and finish a Strong
27th,

This year's l-Iarricr team, which
many consider by far the finest
yet, has had the difficult task of
continually facing first rate
competition. Nearly every meet
has been difficult and the runners
have performed remarkably well
under the continual pressure.
Benefitting from the competition,
they have shown rapid
improvement, and now reaching
the peak of their performance
they provide formidable
opposition to the strongest of
opponents.

Rockland, Cobleskill
Win Over F rash Squad

bv Mike Twomay
State's freshman soccer team
suffered two defeats last week at
the hands of two community
colleges. Cobleskill C.C. took the.
Albany eleven last Wednesday by
a score of 5—1, and Rockland C.C.
handed them their worst loss this
year, 10-1.

Hackett Wins Meet,
Albany Places F ifth

In the freshman racc, Albany's
Harriers could manage only a
fifth, but they Were led with an
impressive victory by co-captain
Dennis Hackett. Pressed for one
of the few times this season,
Hackett maintained a strong
position throughout the race.
With a mile to go in the 3.6 mile
course he took the lead of the
seven team ﬁeld and continued
out front to the finish.

His winning time of 18:19.6
was the best ever by an Albany
runner over the course and placed
him third in the allvtime best
listing which is headed by the

win ner of the varsity race,
Stonitsch.
After I-lackett, however, the

Danes showed little depth and a
huge gap developed between the
ﬁrst man and the rest of the team.
Running second for Albany, in his
strongest race to date, was Lou
Wittig who ﬁnished 23rd. He was
followed by Paul Holmes 28th,
Rick Liese 33rd, and Paul
Novakowaki 36th.

The “Baby Danes" ended with
116 points and trailed Trenton
State (48), C.W. Post (63),
Springﬁeld (82), and Boston State
(84).

Like the varsity, the freshmen
end their season at home, facing
Post Saturday and LeMoyne the
following Tuesday.

In the third portion of the
Invitational, Suffolk Community
won the Junior College division
with ﬁve men in the top ten.
Individual honors went to Bob
Schweinsberg of Auburn who beat
his nearest competitor by half a
minute in the time of18134.6.

Cobleskill did most of its
scoring in the first period and
managed to hold State to only
one goal, although unable to score
further. Coach I'Iandzel
experimented with a 4-lineman,
2-halfback, d-fullback offense, but
this proved to be disastrous when
Cobleskill broke through the
unseasoncd lines repeatedly.

Ile reverted to a 4-3-3 defense
in the second quarter. One factor
attributed to the team's loss; that.
was the size of the Cobleskill
ﬁeld. Albany is used to a larger
ﬁeld and more time to move

The fresh had the same trouble
last Saturday at Rockland. The
small ﬁeld, plus Cobleskill‘s more
experienced team that features
several foreign players, helped to
down the State squad.

The lone Albany goal was
scored in the third quarter by
Gavin Lauder, who with Chris
Werner represented Albany ably
with fine play throughout the
game.

SDS Plans

Pro-Election

Demonstration

by Valerie Ives

There will be a march in the
city of Albany on Monday, Nov 4
to hand out flyers about the
election to Working people.

The march will start at Draper
at 3:00 and procedc to strategic
places in downtown Albany.
Those participating in the march
will wear black and pass out
leaflets probably stating that there
is no choice among the major
Presidential candidates but to vote
for the minor candidates. On next
Monday and Election Day
National SDS calls for a
nationwide strike. SDS, here,
decided to have the march on
Monday in order to reach people
as they are coming out of work.

Also discussed at the meeting
were plans to go to Dippikill on
the weekend of November 15.
The purpose of this would be to
formulate a plan of action on
campus and decide what the role
of SDS is on campus. They also
want to resolve whether they
want to get more involved in
campus or in community affairs.
If they want to get more involvad
with the education in this school
they expect to have some force,
because they have members on
Central Council.

A major part of the meeting
consisted of an enthusiastic
debate among the approximately
thirty people who came to the
meeting. The discussion was over
a statement issued by the National
SDS that there is no difference
between the three major
candidates for President. Because
there was so much disagreement
over this, one of the main
purposes of the conference at
Dippikill will be to decide what
their opinion will be on this and
other issues.

J ohnson Announces

Halt To Bombing.

By FRANK SWOBODA
WASHINGTON (DVD-Prea-
ident Johnson Thursday night
ordered a total halt to the
bombing of North Vietnam and
llld the Saigon government and
the National Liberation Front
would be brought into broad-
ened and “intensive” peace
talks in Paris on Wednesday.

The President said in a
nationwide television address
that he had reason to expect
that North Vietnam would begin
“prompt, productive, serious
and intensive negotiations in an
atmosphere that is conducive to
progress" when the broadened
talks start.

But American
nounced while Johnson was
speaking that North Vietnam
understands that the bombing
halt would be broken if prompt
and useful talks were not
initiated in Paris.

The officials said that no
ceasefire in South Vietnam had
been agreed upon. They said the

officials an-

war would continue in the
South.

The President underscored
this.

“The new phase of negotia-
tions which opens on Nov. 6

does not—repeat does not~1locs
not mean that a stable peace
has yet come to southeast
Asia," the President said in the
prepared text of his television
speech, which was taped in
advance.

Conﬂict

0n Mafia’s Role In Area

by Jill Punik

“In order to get acquainted
with the elements in the campaign
for District Attorney, “ the
Greater Colonic Chamber of
Commerce held a debate at the
Golden Fox between Joseph
Scully, Democratic candidate for
the DA's office and Arnold
Proskin, the Republican
candidate.

The two men clashed on the
issue of the presence of organized
crime, the Maﬁa, in Albany

Countv
Scully asserted, “the county

has been free of organized crime
thorughout 40 years of
Democratic rule."

ban
Party y

Upon Muskie's arrival, Mayor
Erastus Coming of Albany,
greeted him. A brass band was
also at the airport to welcome the
Senator. When questioned by a
reporter concerning his thoughts
on the recent talks of peace in
Vietnam, Muskie responded by
saying,‘t am in no positon to
speak on the matter.‘

The crowd that waited to greet
Muskie numbered approximately
300. The majority of the members
were college students form
neighboring schools. The attitude
of the crowd was one of jubiliince,
cxpccially when Muskie mingled
in the crowd to shake hands.
Muskie sccmcd quite pleased by
the turnout.

According to Mayor Corning,
Vicc I’rosidcnl llulicrt
Humphrey's chariot-s of gaining
the Presidential Nomination are
increasing everyday. He further
added that "the
IIllnllet‘L‘y‘MuSkIt' ticket will take
the city, the county, the state,
and the nation.‘

The Senator was unable to
grant a news conference for the
reporters because of the shortage
of time. Muskie's next stops were
Pouglikeapsio and New York.

Proskin, opposed to this
assertion, stated that the “Mafia‘s
foothold in Albany" must be
routed out. By this statement he
directly implied the Maﬁa’s
presence in Albany.

He referred to the recent Grand
Jury investigations which revealed
the existence of organized crime
and a rise in the use of drugs. (18
youths were recently arrested
allegedly because they were
smoking marijuana.)

Proskin said there is no reason
for not investigating such issues.
He also suggested that “major
crime cannot endure without the
aid of local police."

The Republican nominee called
for an investigation of the Mafia‘s
link with Arizona Biochemical
Company, a garbage collection
ﬁrm holding contracts with a
number of community agencies.

Scully, rather than pursue the
collection of evidence, said he
would wait for an investigation till
more facts were forthcoming.

Proskin stated that he has, in
the past, offered sound, basic
programs to deal with the
increased narcotics traffic and the
growth of crime.
. l

  

 

Scully, discussing the arrest of
the 18 Bethlehem youths on
charges of drug usage, said that a
marijuana cigaret found in an ash
tray (as was the case) is no reason
to assume the Euilt of all 18.

Proskin, however, chose to deal
with the issue by offering ‘steps
to prevent the use of drugs before
it starts." He also linked the rise

of drug use with organized crime
indicating that the former is a
symptom of the latter.

DART, District Attorney's
Readiness Team, will be
established by Proskin, if elected,
in order to facilitate
communication with youths.

Radio and newspaper
representatives from local media
questioning the candidates,
requested each to give their
deﬁnition of law and order.

Scully suggested that law and
order means the right of society
to exist with minority groups and
their rights. ‘ Minority groups
cannot, however, impose their will
on the majority."

Proskin said that law and order
is ‘ the maintenance of tranquility
had the peaceful coexistence of all
people within a society "

 

  

 

"There may well be very
hard fighting ahead," Johnson
motioned.

Johnson said the bombing halt.
would be instituted as of 8 am.
EST Friday.

“I have reached this decision
on the basis of developments in
the Paris talks," the Chief
Executive announced.

“And I have reached it 'in the
belief that this action can lead
to progress toward a peaceful

settlement of the Vietnamese
War. "
The President said the

decision very closely conformed
to statements he had made in
the past concerning a bombing
halt.

Stressing that peace could
still be far off, the President
said 'that arrangements of this
kind are never foolproof."

But he said that in light of
carefully considered and unani»
mous advice from military and
diplomatic leaders, “I have
ﬁnally decided to take this step
now and to really determine the
good faith of those who have
assured us that progress will
result when bombing ceases and

try to ascertain if any early
peace is possible."

Johnson made his television
speech exactly seven months

after announcing, on March 31
that he had ordered a geogra-
phical limit on the bombing of
North Vietnam. That resulted in
the preliminary talks in Paris
between U.S. and North Vietna-
mese representatives.

But the talks became bogged
down when the North Vietna-
mese negotiators insisted that a
full and complete bombing halt
would have to precede any
negotiations on a settlement of
the war.

Before going on the air,
Johnson met with the National
Security Council and other top
diplomatic and military leaders,
including members of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff for 15 minutes in
the White House.

The session broke up with the
President and Secretary of
State Dean Rusk, both wearing
broad smiles, posing for pic-
tures. Gen. William C. West-
moreland, for four years the
American commander in Viet-
nam, sat with them at the
cabinet table.

The President said that he
had informed the three major
candidates for the Presidency—
Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey, Richard M. Nixon
and George C. Wallace—of the
decision. In addition, Johnson
told congressional leaders from
both parties.

In his speech Johnson empha-
sized that the U.S. govern-
ment's agreement to represen-
tation by the National Libera-
tion Front in Paris did not
amount to U.S. recognition.
