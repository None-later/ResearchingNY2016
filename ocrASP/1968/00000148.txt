The NLF is the political arm
of the Viet Cong, the Commu-

nist forces native to South
Vietnam.
"A regular session of the

Paris talks will take place on
Wednesday, Nov. 6, at which
the representatives of the
government of South Vietnam
are free to participate," John-
son said. “We are informed by
the representative of the Hanoi
government that the representa-
tives of the National Liberation
Front will also be present. I
emphasize that their attendance
in no way involves recognition
of the National Liberation Front
in any form.’

Johnson said, however, that
the presence of the NLF at the
Paris talks conformed to the
long standing contention by the
United States “that the NLF
would have no difficulty making
its views known."

Johnson said the "overriding
consideration that governs us at
this hour is the chance and the
opportunity that we might have
to save human lives, save
human lives on both sides of the
conflict. Therefore, I have
concluded that we should see if
they (Hanoi) are acting in good
faith.

‘ We could be mislead—and
we are prepared for such a
contingency. We pray to God it
does not occur."

Rocky Breaks Ground For
New SUNYBuffalo Campus

BUFFALO, N.Y. (UPI)—Gov-
ernor Rockefeller promised a
bright educational and economic
future for the area Monday dur-
ing ground-breaking ceremonies
for the new 1,200-acre campus
of State University at Buffalo.
The governor, predicting a
community growth of 70,000 per-
sons connected in some way
with the campus in suburban
Amherst, described the $600 mil-
lion facility . a key unit in
the state university system.
"Here at Buffalo, we have the
best of both worlds—the rich
tradition of excellence and the
diversity brought to the state
university system by a vener-
able private institution, the Uni-

versity of Buffalo, and the dy-
namics, drive and financial
strength of the world’s fastest
growing state university,’ Rock-
efeller said.

About 1,000 persons, including
leaders of industry, government
and education, watched as the
governor turned the first patch
of earth with a silver spade
used 25 years ago to break
ground for the present Buffalo

Boycott To Converge
On Stuyvesant Plaza

by Marcia Stalker

Stuyvesant Plaza will be the
scene of picketing today in
cooperation with the boycott on
California grapes. The
Student-Faculty Committee for
Equal Opportunity will meet
interested students at 3 pm. in
the Dutch Quad dining room;
from there, they will proceed to
the Plaza.

Students will direct their
picketing to the Grand Union and
Central Markets, since these local
markets sell California grapes.

Local newspapers will be
contacted to make the public
aware that the students' objective

is to influence consumers to
support the boycott, not to
obstruct the normal flow of

shopping traffic. The students say
they will be merely exercising
their lawful right to advertise
against a product.

The Student Faculty
Committee sent a letter to the
Grand Union last week requesting
a halt in purchase of California
pes.

According to the letter, the

‘E
a

boycott should be supported
because, among other reasons, the
grape pickers of California earn
very meager wages, work under
unsanitary conditions, and have
no health or pension plans.

The Grand Union refuses to
take a stand on the boycott issue.
I‘hey claim their job is to provide
food for the area, not to settle a
California labor dispute.

They believe consumers should
have the right to decide whether
or not they will support the grape
boycott.

Problems Facing

U.N.

Ex Elored ByTickner

Y Loren Ostrander

Dr. Fred J. Tickner, Dean of
Graduate School of Public Affairs,
stated that. "universal pence can
be achieved only if nations want it
and work together for il,‘ at the
Eleventh Annual Faculty Lecture.

This was one of the main points
that ’l‘ickncr brought out when he
spoke last Wednesday evening.
About forty-five people attended
this lecture in the CC ballroom.

Stating the popular
misconception that the United
Nations is a super-power for
pencs, Tickner talked about some
of the problems that the UN has
encountered. He continued by
saying that today, when two wars
are currently waging, many people
believe that the UN has failed.

To dismiss this belief, Tickncr
briefly discussed problems
including the Suez Crisis and the
Congo Crisis. He explained what
the UN did in these situation.

Many times, Tickner went on,
major powers leave out the UN
when a conflict arises hoping that
they may gain world prestige
solving the problem themselves,
But, at the same time, those
countries see the need for the
United Nations. This is true, he
stated, bccuusc governments do
present questions In the UN, they
do not withdraw from the UN,
and they feel obligated to static
their policies to the world.

Tickncr also discussed the
charter of the United Nations and
the various organizations under
the UN. These organizations are
the World Health Organization,
International Labor Organization,
Food and Agriculture
Organization, and UNESCO.

’I‘ickner their stated some ()1 Lin:
problems that these organizations
have helped to solve. One example
was in 1946 when the World
Health Organization eliminated
malaria from India.

Before coming to the University,

Focusing on student
demonstrations in Latin America,
the Young Socialist Alliance
presented three speakers last night
who were directly involved in
such incidents. ‘It can happen
anywhere', stated student Judy
Brink, describing the student riots
which broke out in Mexico City
during the summer. Judy, who

..as studying at the National
University of Mexico during the
summer outbreak was studying at
the National University of Mexico
during the summer outbreak,
reported that the students did not
initiate the fighting but were ﬁred
upon by the ‘riot police’ for
ascertaining their right of
expression and petition.

Discussed

by Holly Seitr

‘ We need your help." was the
most frequently used phrase at
the Newman Club meeting
entitled “An Evening of Social
Involvement."

With the idea of channeling
college students into social and
recreational programs in the
Albany “inner city," a forum of
ﬁve speakers explaining various
agencies was presented.

Over sixty interested students
heard speakers from Trinity
Institute, Arbor Hill Community
Center, Providence House, St.
Joseph's Parish and the Big
Brother-Big Sister Program.

Describing the Big Brother-Big
Sister program as the ‘nnswcr to
most of our ills,‘ Daniel Lutz
outlined the need for students
willing to become a Big Brother or
Sister to u youngster of Albany.
He stated that Albany was one of
the first to use college students,

Attack on the University
contradicts the students' freedom
of thought, a basic ideal in Latin
American education.

‘The fight for student freedom
became representative of the fight
for freedom against the
oppression of the government',
commented Judy.

‘La Noche 'l‘ristc', October 12 in
Mexico City, was the topic of
speaker Robert DiScipio, also a
student at the University. He feels
that such revolts are bringing
international focus on the causes
underlying protests.

‘The Mexican students wanted
to cure the ills of a sick society:
Yankee imperialism, class
distinctions, domination by one
government, police brutality, an
antiquated university system.
Student revolt is calling an end to
the old order‘, stated DeCcipio.

Turning the attention to Puerto
Rico, Florencio Merccz, member
of a student radical group,
described student revolt as ‘a side
by side struggle with the
oppressed people, rooted in
political, as well as economic
problems.
