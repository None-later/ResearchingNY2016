Mr. Gall failed to see the value of
‘Motel's’ ‘shock effect.‘ Unlike
his treatment of the first two

believe he found little or nothing
in it.

The mechanical and violent
ripping-off of the clothes, the
rending of the bed‘a sheets and

B ehavior

To the Editor:

1 recently attended the rally in
the gymnasium for Paul O’Dwyer
and found the evening to be quite
entertaining. l was however
somewhat disappointed with the
behavior of the audience at the
beginning of the rally when Dr.
Wilkie and his wife were
performing. A majority of the
people were talking loud enough
so that those wishing to hear the
Wilkies had a difficult or
impossible time doing so. i felt
the rudeness which did persist
throughout their performance was
very discourteous. ’l‘he Wilkics,
who are well-known and respected
for their talents in many parts of
the state, should have received the
attention anti silence any
performer receives whether he is
appreciated or not. Of course,
when ’l‘um Paxton appeared, the
noise finally died down and
people suddenly started listening.
Well it was about time! A little
late maybe?!

To the Editor:

Recently l was picked up and
taken in by the Security Guard.
The ineptitude shown by the
officers who took me in is
intolerable. They were assigned to
stake out Dutch Quad in search of
a girl who “matches” my
description. She was reported to
have been soliciting magazines for
the Continental Sales
Corporation, a fraudulent
organization which is infamous
for prcying upon University
students. There were two officers
ittvolved, one in the lobby of
Stuyvesant Tower and one in it car
outside the Quad. The point is,
while both of these officers were
busily escorting me bodily,
(though i was not resisting), to
the Security Building, who was
keeping an eye on the ntnkeout
point? Surely one officer would
have been sufficient to show an

[The Greek Echo

When we first sat down togetbr
to organize our ideas, we asked
each other; Where do we start?
How do we open up the ﬁrst
column about Greeks for
everyone in the University? Well,
we decided that it seemed only
proper that we state our purpose
for writing the articles--that will
follow-~ and after much
consideration, we realized that the
column should be a stimulus for
others to get involved with the
Greeks.

With each new year, the
percentage of Greeks on campus
steadily dwindles; to single out.
one cause for the decline would
be impossible. However, Greeks
are being forgotten or overlooked
on the campus, and a prime
example of the situation is last
year’s yearbook, Torch ‘68.

Only twenty-five pages were
allotted to the Greek
organizations on campus in last
year’s Torch; why was such a
small amount of space give to a
group which strongly supports all
campus activities? Without our
cooperation, the Homecoming
Parade, Holiday Sing, State Fair,
and AMII‘ athletics would be in
poor shape. Besides these four
activities, Greeks help to plan and
coordinate most of the major
activities on campus.

Yearbooks in the past have
contained at least the composite
pictures of all the fraternities and
sororities-~suddenly they were
absent from Torch '68. We were
limited to one page apiece and a
few candid shots; why was our
space deleted? What was the
reason behind their decision?

The Greeks, though, were not
the only ones who were unfairly
overlooked; during the past year,
our basketball team amassed an
18-11 overall record, almost
received an NCAA tournament
bid, and had a player named to
the All-ECAC team. Our team,
which worked really hard over the
long season, received one and a
half pages of coverage; on the
other hand, Aunt Fanny’s Garage,
which played an exceedingly
integral part in University life, was
allotted two pages.

Last year, each sorority and
frat had to pay $25 for their page.
The coverage in past yearbooks
had been free and more extensive.
Don't misunderstand us; we don't
mind paying for our space, as long
as we get something to show for
it. For ouch Greek group the
following should be included;
composite pictures with names, a

list of the officers, and the
emblem. We feel too that [SC __

and
Diane Battaglino

IFC, and Pan Hel Council should
also be involved, since they help
to coordinate the activities of the
Greeks. These pictures were part
of most yearbooks in the
pastuwhy can't we have the same
set-up if we are willing to pay for
it:

Our yearbook is a mirror of our
campus life, and Greeks are a
major part of the campus. Any
freshmen looking at the Torch can
get a distorted view of our
activities, based on the type of
photos put ther.

What do you think?????

Invisible

One of the major topics of
conversation today is the
revolution on the college
campuses. The public is getting
the impression that proverbially
impatient youth is out-doing itself
this generation.

An outsider, depending on his
or her background, might go as far
as to see current developments as
unGodly and sinful. Said outsider
is sadly mistaken.

Today's student has a heritage
which includes the greatest
teachings of Mankind; those
which counsel us is love our
neighbors and forgive our
enemies. He also has the stigma of
nuclear destruction hanging over
his now-and -future world. This is
good incentive to practice what
our elders have been preaching.

It is only logical that the
revolution should begin on the
college campus; we are the
inheritors of the best that our
society has to give. We have the
background, the drive, and the
previous education that mark us
for membership in the coming
elite. We are the leaders of the
future.

Many students favor the seizure
of control now, in violent revolt
against their middle-class
background. Unfortunately they
don’t see the conflict inherent in a
seizure of power from the hands
of the middle-class by students;
we are the best of the
middle-class. Our presence in
college is indicative of either our
middle-class background or
aspiration.

By attacking middle-class values
from these citadels of middle-class
life, they are letting their
hypocrisy show.

On the other hand, we have
students searching for a different
type of revolution. 'l‘hcy

“Football will never exist at
Albany State, nor should it ever

opinion of the self-appointed

that if football existed, the

school, displacing the long hairs.

Right Way

 

 

Undoubtedly, one of the most
emotional and controversial issues
in the 1968 campaign has been
“law and order." These words
have been interpreted in several
ways. To some people a call for
law and order is just that, xi call
for law and order.To others, the
phrase has a racist connotiation.
Some have altered the words to
make them softer and more
“humane.' They often change the
phrase to read “order and justice’
or ‘ law and justice."

On the surface no one disagrees
with order and justice. Certainly
justice for all must be a goal
towards which we are constantly
striving. It is the implication of
the words as they relate to law
and order that 1 object to. "Order
and justice" seems to imply an
acceptance of civil disobedience,
that we have a right to decide
which laws we will obey. It seems
to say that people can decide on
the streets what is just. Of course,
as long as We have a responsive
judicial system it will be up to the
courts to determine which laws
are just or unjust.

Order and justice has been a
favorite cry of llllll, and we can
only wonder in horror about the
implications this has coming from
him. During his campaign for the
nomination, lohnson's Charley
McCarthy said that Earl Warren
was one of the best things that
ever happened to America. We
mustn‘t forget either, that Hubert
once said that if he lived in a
ghetto he'd lead a pretty good riot
himself” With this in mind,
Humphrey's call for order and
justice sounds to me like anarchy
in the streets and a field day for
the criminal.

On the other band, billy-club

law and order and stationing
30,000 troops in Washington DC
as promised by Wallace is not the
answer either. People have to
want to obey the laW.

In the case of civil turmoil,

Nixon proposes an end to the
plantation benevolence and
degrading welfare expounded by
Humphrey. Nixon wants to give
all people a stake in society, it
piece of the action. His call for
“Black Capitalism," giving black
citizens loans so that they can
become owners and managers of
their own businesses would go a
long way towards restoring
respect for law in the ghetto.
These people would have a stake
in preserving the peace.
The simple facts in this election
concerning law and order are:
Wallace would hopelessly divide
our nation with ruthless force.
Humphrey's leniency and reckless
statements about
lead a riot if he lived in a ghetto
make him unthinkable. We need
llicliard Nixon.
