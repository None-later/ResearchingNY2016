WILDEK’S THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH on NOVEMBER 6-9 at 8:30 in
PAGE HALL. left to right: Judith Weisen; M

Pinelli. Bottom: Gary Restifo.

 

You’ve probably never heard
of, much less seen, Jean Renoir‘s
“The Rules of the Game." Yet for
me and many others it’s one of
the most touching and vital films
ever made, a masterpiece of
comedy, pathos, and-~rare for any
film-- wisdom. In the aristocratic
world of mirrors, bright crystal,
objets d'art, and richly parqueted
floors, is enacted a dazzling
comedy of manners that ends in
violent death.

"This film is intended as
entertainment-mot as social
criticism” sets the ironic tone at
the very start. After Andre Jurieu
flies the Atlantic for his love
Christine, he is invited to a
weekend party by her husband,
the Marquis. The contrast
between Jurieu's naive
romanticism and the aristocrats'
morally bankrupt cynicism is
balancedby a typically Renoirian
iron: Jurieu may be better, but
how boring is his stubborn honor
compared to the Marquis' style
and panache! Catherine says,

Last year, in a column in the
ASP dealing with the State
University Theatre production of
Elmer Rice's “The Adding
Machine,’ I reserved most of the
article for a discussion of my
observation that the play‘s
director, Martin Mann, had chosen
for his third production here at
State, as with his first two, a
drama that centered primarily on
the internal mental conflicts of
the leading character.

It is with interest that I note

“Andre is too sincere. Sincere
men are dull."

No more purely comic film
than “The Rules of the Game"
has ever been made. Its surface,
light and warm yet resilient at
every point, reminds one of "The
Marriage of Figaro," while at any
moment a burst of commedia
dell‘arte or Molierian clowning
may flash out at us. The pace can
instantly shift to a burst of comic
speed for a chase or bit of
business, so that a sense of a
breathless impromptu races
through the film. “Stop this
farce!" shouts the Marquis at the
height of the merry confusion,
and the reply “Which one?"
reverberutes ironically up to the
very last frame.

Renoir’s visual style can be
capsulizcd in one word: invisible.
The camera races and dodges
around the characters with a
fluidity equaled only by Fellini’s
"8%"; it surrounds, envelops them
like a me 'lic line weaving around
a figure; yet the style is all

Coffee House Circuit
Features Penny Long

by F ran Drcher

The Coffee House Circuit is
featuring Penny Lang, a
folkvainger in the Campus Center
cafeteria each evening this week.
Penny strums the guitar, and is
accompanied by a bass and a
harmonica.

Penny, a tall blonde, has a deep
nasal voice which fluctuates
according to the content of the
song. When her song is sad, her
face is contorted and her voir'e is
low; when she wants to stress a
thought, her voice booms out at
the audience, startling, and her
face beams. ,When she begins a
song, Penny takes on the littlllldt'
of the song, and the audience can
sec that it is part of her.

She sings a variety of songs
including fold songs, country
western, and blues. ller songs dual
primarily with love and war, and
for the most part are unfamiliar to
the audience, although she sings
“Love Minus Zero" and
“Dblphin.”

One song about Vietnam is not
at all subtle, and brim with
sarcasm. She reaches uri in that
song, but most of the others,
although well executed, are not
stimulating or inspiring to the
audience.

Penny sings one song which was
composed by little children at a
summer camp, on the occasion of
visiting day. Sung to the tune of
Ifrcrc Jacques, the words are:

“l'lfarijuuna, Marijuana

LSI). LS!)

College kids are niahin ' it,

High school kids are lahiri' il

Why can '1 we H?

Why can't we?"

With such a beautiful, powerful
voice, perhaps Penny could arouse
the audience more by singing a
few more well-known songs,
varying the tempo, and inviting us
to jriiii iii and sing with her,

beautifully unobtrusive. Every
time I see the film I resolve to
watch for technique and every
time I’m so arrested by the pace,
the mise-en-scene, the acting, and
the repartee that I conclude that
Renoir's technique may be the
best one—-the technique that
conceals itself.

The central episode is a rabbit
hunt, that for richness of
implication matches no other such
scene ever filmed. (Yes, I like the
hunt in “Tom Jones" too, but
after you see “Rules” you'll
realize how much Richardson
owes to Renoir.) On an overcast
morning, the aristocrats and their
guests settle in blinds to wait for
heaters to drive game out of the
woods. There are no pheasants
left, only rabbits. The shooting
begins. Jurieu is inept, the
Marquis is a crack shot. Rabbits
die in squirming agony. The
beaters exchange coarse
pleasiintries. More rabbits die. The
game is over before we know it,

and the hunting party struggles
back to the chateau. At the close
of the film Jurieu, about to clopc
with Christine, is accidentally shot
by the Marquis’ gamekecpcr (a
German) who mistakes him for
the man who stole his own wife.
Jurieu, a witness reports, ‘ rolled
over like a rabbit.” 'I‘he aristocrats
confront the occurrence
characteristically: the Marquis
calls it “a regrettable accident”,
another admonishcs Christine,
“People are looking at you!"
Then we remember that this is
France on the eve of World War
II, and We realize how soon the
game will pass into oblivion.

But although the simultaneous

attraction and rcpt-lliincc of this
elegant world is ltr'nriir's uvr-rt
subject. it isn'l the basis for his
iinplii-it valiir-s.Wliiit counlsln lilo,

and Joy.

that the kick-off production for
the 1968-69 theatre season is
Thornton Wilder’s "The Skin of
Our Teeth," being directed by
Mann and bearing absolutely no
relevance to the theory discussed
above.

In “The Skin of Our Teeth,"
none of the leading roles can be
said to be of more thematic
importance than another. The
burden of delivering the message
of the drama is placed upon the
shoulders of Mr. and Mrs.

Provincial Players
Auditions

Plans currently under way
include “Pageant Wednesday" and
“Comedy Improvisation.”
“Pageant Wednesday” would
occur on the Wednesday of State
Fair Week. The play would be
presented with a traveling wagon
as a stage.

The players will hold auditions
in the CC Assembly Hall from
7:30—10 p.m. on the nights of Nov
5 and 6, Tuesday and Wednesday,
for all students interested in
performing in “Comedy
Improvisations."

Those attending the auditions
should bring with them any
original comedy act they have

Further, each person trying out
for the auditions will be given one
or two “situations” and asked to
work independently or with
another person

“Comedy Improvisations” will
be auditioned for the Telethon on
Saturday, Nov 9 at 1:00 p.m. in
the CC Main Lobby.

Androbus, the two obvious
prototypes for the eternal human
couple.

Intended as foils to their
parents are the Androbus' two
children, Gladys and Henry.
Equally divided between these
thematic functions is Sabina, the
symbol of eternal femal
sensuality. Sabina will act both as
a foil in the lives of Mr. and Mrs.
Antrobus and as a primary
speaker in the over-all statement
of Wilder‘s total theme.

It would be misleading,
however, for me to suggest that
Mann is now attempting to direct
an entirely different style of play.
There is a deﬁnite similarity
among the four productions
including this present one that
Mann has chosen to present here:
all these plays have utilized
fantastic elements and none has
been a so-called realistic drama.

Considering that the
performances in Mann's plays
have been of the highest quality. I
have no doubts that he will be
able to bring out with expert
touches all the brilliant comedy
and the marvel of what should be
a very absorbing and entertaining
production.

Thornton Wilder's ‘ The Skin of
Our Teeth" will play next
Wednesday through Saturday,
Nov 6-9 in Page Hall. Tickets are
available (free for those who paid
Student Tax) at the Campus
Center Information Desk.

I’m sure of it. Last week's column
by Tom Cervone and Doug
Goldschmidt was a welcome relief
from the senseless complaints
heard continually all over the
campus.

The food served here is
probably the best of any college
campus in the area; I've eaten
meals (illegally, of course) at
private schools such as Holy
Crow, Marist, and Siena, and
friends there have been amazed
that I enjoy such things as edible
breakfasts, meat slices more than
1/8 inch thick, a different menu
every week, a wide choice of food
at each meal, and an occasional
hot serving. Food service at the
other University centers is also no
better than it is here.

I have my complaints about
such things as the seconds policy
and the meal hours, but the food
here is enjoyable, even apart from
comparisons, and at least a few
people I've talked to agree with
me (such as the suitemates who’ve
signed below).

Bad food is a popular topic of I.

conversation, but for those who
really think
terrible meals I recommend
reading the column mentioned
above (ASP, Oct. 22), and/or
trying the food elsewhere.

Tax Questions

To the Editor:

The passage of a Mandatory
Student Tax raises some questions
in my mind. First, will this tax
enable Albany State University to
get decent groups for our
concerts? At the State University
at Stony Brook, performers such
as Joni Mitchell, Tim Hardin, Ten
Years After, and Blood, Sweat
and Tears have already been there.
On November 16, the same school
is having Big Brother & the

Holding Company, and Richie .

Havens. And in early December,

they are going to have Simon & '

Garfunkelll Why is it that Stony
Brook can have such top name
groups, and we have the pleasure
of having the American Breed? I
should also mention that these
concerts are free. Once a Stony
Brook student pays his tax, these
activities are without cost. Will
concerts. and the like still require
additional charges with the
mandatory tax?

I also wonder how the student
who does not like to socialize
feels with this mandatory student

tax. I am sure that a number of
