Poultney Vermont and swept
every match, winning 4-0. Shelia
Jacobs, no. 1 singles, and Belinda

to Vassar. Belinda Stanton was
the sole winner for Albany as she
recorded a 6-4, 6-2 win over her
opponent.

The last match scheduled at
home against New Paltz was again
rained out and since the weather

compete in, the rest of the season
was cancelled.

APA, STB- Record Wins In
Prelude To Sat. Contest

The stage was set this past week for one of the most important games in League 1 football as both APA
and STB recorded Victories. APA, in scoring a 12-0 victory over the Nads, preserved their undefeated record

with only two games remaining.

STB kept themselves in the race with a 10-0 win over Upsilon Phi Sigma.

 

The league leaders c a
determined pass rush and tight
secondary to throw two
touchdown passes, one to Denny
Elkin and one to Jack Sinnott.

The Nads, who have yet to win
this year, looked as if they might
pull the upset of the year in the
ﬁrst half as they refused to give
up any substantial gains to APA'S
strong passing attack.

in the second quarter, however,
Gary Torino found Denny Elkin
open and hurled a pass which
resulted in a six point lead for
APA. The point-after attempt
failed, and the APA men took a
6-0 lead into the second half.

Led by quarterback Torn
Mullins, the Nads drove down the
ﬁeld only to have their drive
halted when a long pass was
dropped in the end zone.

APA, helped by two successive
pass interference calls, brought
the ball to the Nads five yard line
where they scoredon a pass from
Gary Torino to Jack Sinnott.

In the game played Tuesday.
STB, who are tied for second with
Tappan Hall, registered two
safeties and a touchdown in their
victory over UFS.

The STB defense scored the
ﬁrst safety when a snap from
center went over the quarterbacks
head and into the end zone. The
second safety came when the UFS
quarterback was caught in the end
zone by a strong pass rush.

STB's lone touchdown came on
a pass from quarterback Bruce
Send to tight and Mike Pavy.

This Saturday, APA and STD
meet in a must game for both
teams. 11' STB is to remain in
contention for the title, they must
register a win over the APA men.
Although a loss will not
eliminated AIBA it will make their
ﬁrst place position much less
secure. if the game results in a tie,
STB will be eliminated from the
race whereas APA will then only
be a game ahead of Tappan whom
they play a week from tomorrow.

The game this Saturday will pit
the league's two strongest offenses
against the two strongest defenses.

APA has scored an amzing 107
points for an average of over
twenty points a game. Their
defense, on the other hand has
given up only one touchdown all
year.

STB has scored fifty points in
ﬁve games and their defense has

A GRAPE PICKET was organized at Stuyvesant Plaza in an effort to
to discourage customers from buying grapes.

Concerned Students Hear
0n Biafra Crisis

Speakers

by Valerie Ives
“By December, if the situation
doesn't change, 25,000 people a
day will die of starvation in
Biafra." This statement was made
by Walter Ofonagnro, one of the
speakers at an informal meeting

Tuesday night of students
concerned about the shocking
situation in Biafra. The other

speaker was Mary Umolu.

Ofonagoro began by reviewing
the history of Biafra and the
political difficulties that led to the
present crisis there. He went into
how Nigeria is trying “to wipe
Biafrans from the face of the

Umolu noted that deliberate
starvation is not the only method
by which Nigeria is trying to wipe
out the Biafrans. They are also
killing boys over the age of eight
years, abusing the women, and
depriving children of protein,
which will make them mentally
deﬁcient.

People asked why the Riafrans

Plans by the Student-Faculty
Committee for Equal Opportunity
to boycott the purchase of
California grapes by picketing
local supermarkets at Stuyvesant
Plaza on Friday met with legal
obstacles.

The Committee had originally
planned to picket Grand Union
and Central Markets at the Plaza
since the stores had refused to
cooperate with their request to
halt the purchase and sale of
California grapes. Plans were
revised when it was learned that
Stuyvesant Plaza is private
property and large-scale picketing
and distributing of printed
material would be illegal.

It was decided that two people
carrying posters would be
stationed in front of each store in
continuing shifts. The stores were
boycotted on Friday and
Saturday during store hours. The
Committee plans to resume this
schedule next weekend.

won’t take some food offered to
them. The answer given was that
they have good reason for their
fear of being poisoned.

The two speakers also urged
that political pressure he applied
to the United States government
in order to get a cease ﬁre. Umolu
charged the United States with
not wanting to change the face of
Nigeria, yet the United States has
greatly changed its face.

She went on to say that
Senator Brooke had reported to
the U.S. government that
genocide did not exist in Biafra.
She was told that “He travelled
with three women, and the three
women were afraid to go to
Biafra.” She said, therefore, that
the Senator could not say that
genocide didn‘t exist because he
had not even been there.

One of the most effective
agencies to work through is the
Biafra Relief Service Foundation.

front of Central Market on Friday
afternoon, called the local
boycott “a drop in a big bucket."

MYSKAN-IA Recommends
End Of Chaperone Policy

MYSKANIA '68 has announced
its position on the chaperone
policy and sent its
recommendation to LAAC. The
proposals are expected to be
discussed at the Central Council
meeting next Thursday. 0n the
basis of the following rationale,
MYSKANIA proposes: 1. That
the present chaperone
policy be abolished, 2. that no
chaperone be required at any
student event.

“This University's chaperone
policy has long been under
consideration for revision. Despite

Another organization which sends
aid is the World Council of
Churches.

The Community Planning
Committee has refused to
recognize the concerned students
as a temporary group because of a
Constitutional technicality. A new
request will be made this Week.

the fact that no fewer than three
ad hoc committms of Central
Council have studied the present
policy, no revision has yet been
effected. As a result, for reasons
of practicality, the chaperone
policy has not been, and is not
now, rigidly enforced. It is not a
viable system. It is ambiguoust
worded and its L ' seem
arbitrarily conceived. Most
importantly, .however, the
underlying assumptions of the
chaperone policy imply a concept
of student responsibility that we
cannot accept. "

“The present policy implies
that students are able to organize

events independently and
responsibly, finance them
independently and responsibiy,

but are unable to carry them out
without supervision. We cannot
accept this line of reasoning which
is inconsistent with present trends
in the University. In the Alcohol
and Women’s Hours proposals,
and in general, this University has
shown that it will not assume the
position of “inloco parentis" as it

applies to individual student
responsibility.
"What, in fact, does I

chaperone do? Under present

policy, the chaperone is asked to
attend a particular event. He need
not appear at that event at any
speciﬁc time and need not remain
for any specific amount of time.
In fact, he need not even appear,
for if he does not the event will go
an as planned regardless of his
attendence. What then is the

L r ’s legal r " ility?
Under present policy he has none.
He is no more and no less a guest
of the student group."

“Why then, must it be
mandated that a chaperone be
present? Considering the above, it
becomes increasingly
obvious that a chaperone is
needed for no other reason than
to lend an air of supposed
respectability to the event.

The conclusion we are forced
to is that the present chaperone
policy serves no other purpose
than to accommodate standards
of middle-class morality which
can only hinder progress toward
the total recognition of individual
responsibility of students."

“We feel that a modiﬁcation
which would more clearly define
the role of the chaperone and
decrease the impractical

dissertation analysed the role of
oil in Middle Eastern politics. He
received a law degree at Yale and

One student who identiﬁed
himself as a member of the
Socialist Workers Party told of his
party’s support of the Arab

and asked if Jews served in the
“Al Fatah" movement. Hammad
appeared doubtful as the student
insisted that this was a fact.

Credit Hours
Revision

The Academic Affairs
Commission yesterday
overwhelmingly approved the idea
of doing away with the present
system of credit hours.

Dick Collier, head of the
Commission, is now looking into
the possibilities of raising the
maximum number of credits from
17 to 20.

Collier said that some limit
must be imposed because many
students would tend to take on
far too many courses, and then be
able to drop some without
penalty.

The Commission will consider,
and in all likelihood, pass a
specific plan some time next
week.
