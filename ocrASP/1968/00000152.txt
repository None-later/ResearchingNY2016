Student Tax
Referendum
Protected

Students protesting the
conditions under which the
Student Tax Referendum was
passed are now circulating
petitions demanding the
invalidation of the referendum.

The following assertions were
made concerning the election
procedures:

1. Many students were unable
to vote due to a delay in the
distribution of required activity
cards.

2. The athletic fee of $17.50 a
year was not publicized, but
rather appeared as a ‘rider' in the
bill.

3. It was not clear to many
students that the referendum was
other than an opinion poll.

4. At least a 2/3 vote should be
required to pass the mandatory
student tax since this involves the
restriction of basic student
liberties.

Petitions are being circulated at
each quad dinner line. For
commuters, petitions will be
available at the Campus Center
Dining Hall during the day.

The leaders of the movement,
Paul Schlecht and Steve Kichen,
have asked that they be notiﬁed
of any difficulties any student
may have had in voting at
457-7966.

HumphreyMovesAhea
In Latest Harris Poll

NEW YORK (UPl)—Vicc
President Hubert H. Humphrey

has moved th roe percentage
points ahead of Richard M.
Nixon in the final prc-election
poll by Louis Harris &
Associates, it was reported
Monday.

The poll, conducted Sunday,
gave Humphrey 43 per cent of
the vote, Nixon 40 per cent and
third party candidate George C.
Wallace 13 per cent with the
remaining 4 per cent still
undecided.

It was the first time in the
campaign that Humphrey led
the Harris poll, which reported
Nixon leading by 3 per cent last
Friday. The Friday figures,
however, were based on polling
before President Johnson an-
nounced the Vietnam bombing
halt Thursday night.

The Harris poll, based on
interviews with 1,206 voters,
was printed in late afternoon
editions of the New York Post.

Another nationwide poll, the
Sindlinger daily survey, report-
ed Sunday that among voters
interviewed Friday and Satur-
day, Humphrey held a 0.6 lead
over Nixon. Sindlinger gave
Humphrey 34.4 per cent, Nixon

33.8 per cent and Wallace 14.1
per cent with 18.7 still in doubt.
The Sindlinger continued its
survey through Monday.

The final Gallup poll, also
released Sunday, gave Nixon a 2
per cent lead.

Colonial Quad
Vending Machine
Meets Demise

The glass casing of the newly
installed sandwich machine in
Clinton Hall, Colonial Quad was
partially smashed early Saturday
morning and the contents of the
machine were stolen. On Saturday
night the entire glass casing was
smashed and more food was
stolen.

As a result of the vandalism the
director of Clinton Hall has
requested the removal of the
machine. Therefore there will be
only one sandwich machine
available to the residents of
Colonial Quad.

Male students will not be able
to use this machine after 11 p.m.
during the week and 1 p.m. on
weekends because it is located in
Livingston Tower.

Future
Clarified

K
President Evan R. Collins
discussed future building plans of
the University and clarified several
library operations at the
President's Conference with
Students yesterday.

Collins noted that money for
building is alloted in two ways.
First, financial provisions are
made in the budget for planning
new additions. Then after the
planning is completed, money is
then budgeted for construction.
"It is very rare when monies are
budgeted for planning and
construction of a building in the
same year,’ Collins commented.

At. present, a field house is in
the planning stages, Collins
disclosed. The structure will
contain an Olympic pool, an
indoor rink, and a 200x300 foot
arena.

Planning monies are also
currently being used to design an
extension to the west end of the

Sophomore Government

podium. A proposed fifteen
segment section will be added on
to the podium adjacent to the
Social Science building.

The use of the recently aquired
land across Fuller Road was also
discussed. Plans now call for
married student housing and a
Conference Center to be
constructed on the 100 acre plot.

Collins also tied up a few of the
loose ends from lastweek’s
conference. He disclosed that
Lecture Room 1 would remain
open all night starting this week.
The purpose is to give students a
quiet place to study.

Collins further disclosed that
construction will begin in 1969
for an underground parking
facility where the temporary
Colonial Quad parking lot now
exists.

Ur. Clifton C. ’I‘horne, Vice
President for Student Affairs, was
also present at the conference.

Provides New Outlets

The Class of '71 sponsored a
clean-up project at the Trinity
Institute Youth Center in
Albany's South End district last
week. This project marks the
beginning of a new direction in
the class government.

Economy
Balancing

SAN ANTONIO, Tex. (UPI)—
President Johnson’s chief ccon-
omist. said in a rosy election-
eve-report Monday that the
battle against inflation is being
won and “we have turned the
corner toward price stability."

Press Secretary George Chris-
tian, risked if there was any
connection between the report
by Arthur M. Okun, chairman
of the Council of Economic
Advisers, and Tuesday‘s ballot
ing, said "of course not."

“The most recent economic
news provides growing evidence
that the economy is moving into
better balance and that we have

Lurllt‘il the corner toward price

stability," ()Iruii said.

"It nllliultl be emphasized that
our over-all price performance
lh' still far from satisfactory,"

bi- inirled. “Rut improvement is
a fact and no longer just a

forecast. "

Johnson spent a "normal
work day' at the LBJ ltancli
Monday, Christian said, while
llll' presidential candidates were
in the illli hour of their

campaigns.

The Chief Executive and his
wife Iniin liirrl planned to drive
15 miles from the ranch to
Johnson City ’I‘uvsduy to vote
for llubcrt ll. lluniphruy.

The class officers feel that their
purpose as a governmental body
should be to provide as many
outlets as possible for student
participation. They expect to
continue to plan social events, but
these standard events shrill be
coupled with projects which will
provide the opportunity to work
in their new direction.

Thirty-onc- people responded to
the class’ “Get Dirty" campaign.
fly meeting people who had
experienced such problems, the
students were able to recognize
what the problems in Albany’s
South End l'L‘ilIly were.

The class ofl'iccrs, Dick Wesley,
President; Ralph DiMarino, Vice
President; Ilonnic Weiithcrup,
Secretary; and Jeri Yoswcin,
'I‘rcasurcr hope to bring the real
world into the “sterile
atmosphere" of tho University
Campus through projects like the
Trinity Institute. It is their hope
that tbcir classmates will trike
their knowledge "beyond the
realm of high ideas and idle
phrases."

President

Collins concluded by
announcing that he would not be
presiding at the President's
Conference with Students for the
next three weeks. In his absence,
Dr. Thorne will chair the
Conference.

It might be noted that Collins
will be in Europe in the coming

Following last week passage
of Mandatory Student Tax,
Central Council initiated two hills
which futher define the new tax
policy. The first bill delegated
power to Financial Aids to
determine exemptions on the
basis of economic need. The final
appeal for exemption will be the
Student Tax Committee.

The next bill defined the
penalty for non-payment of
Student Tax. Central Council, in
the name of the Student
Association, gave the Registrar
power to withhold grades or
transfer credit unless waiver of
payment was granted by Central
Council or Financial Aids.

in response to President
Collins's criticism, Council passed
another bill for implementation of
the University Athletic Council
(UAC) Report. In a spirit of
co-operation and with the hope of
swift action by the President,
Council retracted its statement of
non-support of the UAC Report.
Previously, Council had stated
that it would not support UAC
unless its recommendation, which
was, in effect, majority student
membership on the proposed
Athletic Council, was accepted by
the President.

WaterburyExperiment:

Two WeekOpen House

Waterbury Hall will hold an
experimental open house in an
attempt to liberalize the present
policy of the University, which
states that all doors must be kept
open at any Open-House, and that
there must. be supervisors on duty
at all times during the time it. is in
progress.

The Waterbury experiment will
consist of a constant open house
from November 8 to November

22 in which Ilicrc will be no
supervisors and no sign-in. On
Week days it will «ml at 10:45

p.m. and on weekends it will end
at 12:45 am.

The reason behind the
experiment is that. the students
want to be given more trust and
responsibility and feel that it is
about time that they receive
it.

They cited as examples the
Iibcrulity of the Union and R.P.I.
colleges' policies on the subject.
Most students believe that the
University should completely
abolish the Open House and that
they should be allowed to have
visitors of the opposite sex in
their rooms at any time, as is the

The experiment is interpreting

meaning that the doors must be
unlocked in order to be open and
not visibly open as was previously
the implied policy of the

The Pueblo Referendum vote
was invalid because the necessary
10% of the student body failed to
vote. However, in view of the
majority voice in favor of the
Referendum statement, (723
voted, 422 yes, 232 no,) the exact
wording of the Referendum
statement was adopted as a
Central Council Prlicy Statement
by a vote of 14-9-2.

In final action, a Budget was
approved for the Student
Education Association after a
vigorously contested $50
reduction, and the Council For
Contemporary Music Budget was
adjusted by a $6000 additional
appropriation so that ticket prices
for future concerts could be
lowered.
