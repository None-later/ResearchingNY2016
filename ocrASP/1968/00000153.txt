Great Exceptions

To the Editor:

Now that the mandatory fee
has been passed by the students, I
believe that it is necessary that the
proper views be given to the
situation. I, therefore, take great
exception to the article that
appeared above the banner-head
of the ASP last Tuesday.

It was accurate to some extent,
but in other ways it was both
inaccurate and mistaken.

First, the phrase “naturally
expressed pleasure" was
editorializing on the part of the
reporter. If someone from the
ASP would like to make
comments about what they think
I naturally take pleasure in, these
thoughts ought to be confined to
the editorial page.

Secondly, the reporting was
grossly inaccurate. With regards to
the married students tax card, it is
not true that the nonatudent
spouse of a State student can buy
a tax card at an INCREASED
rate; rather, this non-student can
buy a card for himself at a
decreased rate from the rate he
would pay as a student. It is quite
true that married students have a
lot fewer coins than the single
student, on the whole.

This sounds like the Student
Association is getting the raw and
of a deal'I however, In actuality,
Student Association ls gaining
increased monetary benefits frcm
people who are not students here.
This is not the main purpose of
the measure though. The idea was
so that the married students and
ihuir spouses would take a more
sctivo part in the University and
‘ i-ttei receive some of the benefits
which they rightfully deserve.

This brings me to the next
important point. Student
Association did not add the two
measures—the faculty payment of
the fee or the married students
tax card—just because it would
increase income. It was felt that
we had something to offer to
everyone here at the University,
and we felt that the faculty and
staff were as much a part of the
University as any one student or
student group.

We, therefore, want to

encourage as many persons as we
can to partake of the benefits
offered to them. We feel that a
better feeling of unity can be
fostered if faculty and staff join
the students in their recreation
and enjoyment. It surely cannot
be wrong to encourage unity and
good feeling with fellow members
of our University Community.

I think that the mandatory fee
will cause some difficulties and
will arouse some feelings in the
student body. Any measure of
this nature could not and does not
please all the persons involved.

And then again, maybe it is
time that the student body begin
to be aroused about something
Instead of calmly going around in
its own world. It's about time that
the student body begin to think
for itself and to make its voice
heard. Everyone was given the
opportunity to vote in the
mandatory fee referendum.

Even though the voting turnout
was higher than ever before. it was
still only about 14%. There is
hope, than. At least 14% of the
students have something to say
for themselves. That means that
only 86% of the students are
apathetic and lazy. There is still
hope.

Surreptitious Security

The image of the security police on this campus
is one of an offensively authoritarian force. We do
not mean to say that the security ofﬁcers are
attempting to turn the University into a police
state, nor do we expect this generalization to

apply to each member of th:

However, the uncouth manner in which many of
the individuals on the security staff act has

created this image.

There have been numerous incidents when a
security guard has unnecessarily ordered students
around. It seems that some of these men have a
totalitarian mind that can conceive of nothing
wrong with ordering a student not to sit on a

table, embarassing him in

acquaintances, or doing some other ridiculous

thing.

Open Letter

To the Editor:

An open letter to State Senator
Erway and the N.Y.S. Legislature:

Upon the occasion of my high
school graduation, I received a
form letter of congratualtions
from a candidate for the N.Y.S.
assembly, Dr. M. L. Fox of
Auburn, N.Y. In that letter he
claimed that by now Ishould have
attained a “mature understanding
of the concepts of ‘freedom,
tolerance, and individual liberty’,"
which is my “heritage as an
American.”

I understand, sir, that an

 

 

What is more frustrating about some oi the
security police is their unwillingness to
accomodate the individual. Too many women have
come back to their dorm a minute or two after the
“let-in", only to ﬁnd the security guard walking
out of the quad and refusing to reopen the dorm.

At a scene of a recent accident where a student
was hit by a car, the authoritarian mentality of a
security ofﬁcer almost had grave consequences.
According to witnesses the guard would not let-
anyone near the victim, who; was going
into shock, until one person was able to force his
way past the ofﬁcer to put a blanket ovcr'the
victim.

Fortunately, not all security ofﬁcers have these
little authoritarian minds. Students should be able
to respect the security ofﬁcer, but who can respec

November 5, i968

 

Presidential elections have
always been a signiﬁcant episode
in the nation's story. They have,
because the outcome of such
elections In a strange animal called
a President, a thing which stalks
the nation and earth, and shapes
signiﬁcantly the fortunes of men.

Every put American President
has, to some extent and for better
or worse, altered the social fabric,
the political system, and the
historical events of his country.
So it is today that the
public—most lof it anyway—goes
to the polls and puts into office
another Mover of Events.

It is interesting to speculate
about what each of those
unnamed millions think he is
going to get. What do those fei
Fifth Avenue faces mean to the
electorate? Is Nixon really a
Savior? Humphrey the Only
Alternative? Wallace a Common

9
Ml,Ihe answer to each of these
questions is probably a resounding
“No.” But one of them is going to
be elected anyway.

What makes for a bad night‘s
sleep tonight, is that the President
of tomorrow has to be so many
things. He has to be a
philosopher-king; he has to be
able to deal with an infinite
variety of people, groups, and
nations; and he has to master
every imaginable type of subject

matter. _
Can a Nixon, a Humphrey, or a

Wallace fill the impressive bill of
this magical animal? Is it not
rather like asking a cow to lay
eggs, or a hen to give milk? Is
there really any person alive who
can become this thing called a
President?

Such questions, however, are at
best superfulous. For whether or
not such a wonderous
transformation from man to
President can occur, tomorrow
everyone will believe that it did,
IN FACT, occur. Thai. is, the
Mover of Events becomes

   
 

  

Red banners unfurled as
thousands of students surged
forward in unison, chanting,
singing, and dancing. Protest signs
exploded with words of

dissatisfaction with the
established order. The scene:
Paris, 1968? Columbia, 1968'.)

Rome, 1968? No! The scene is the
Plaza de Tres Culturas in Mexico
City.

It seems the official press of the
United States government has
paid little-very little—attention
to this great moment‘ for the
Third World.

These were not revolutionary
Europeans or Americans blatantly
expressing defiance to the
establishment in power. No! This
took place in what we Americans
would view as an underdeveloped
nation. Therefore, if 150
Mexicans were horribly and
brutally massacred by the
granaderos or military police, it
was not worthwhile to gain much
coverage in our news media.

For a long time, it was taken
for granted that the King
Kong--Uncle Sam-could suck the
blood of the economies of Latin
nations. Well, the time is drawing
to a close. Americans hiive long
been blind to the coming
revolution in Latin America. Only
with the arrival of the Cuban
Revolution, did America even
become aware that these people
might not be very content under
the yoke of our government's

economic and military
imperiaisim.
Now Cuba has gained its

independence and we accept it, or
better said, try to overlook it. No,

reality, because everyone wishes it
to be so.

Then the Mover begins to move
his people, which he does
correctly, incorrectly, or (more
likely) obliquely. But historically,
politically, and socially, the
President SHALL move America.
He will move it, and most of those
voting today will not know, or
car i, how he does it.

So is it really worth losing sleep
tonight? Most American voters
will not think so. Tonight, they
will rest their heads on their
pillows—and close their eyes.
Tomorrow they will wake, wink
at the victor—and close their eyes
again. . . . Therein lies the rub . . .

On The Other Hand

A Doyleic Tragedy in Three
rte:

Chorus: Hear ye the tale of
virtuous Paul, an R.A. whose
goodneu led to his fall. Listen full
well to this tale of Paul Doyle,
whose love of duty dashed him to
the soil.

Part the first—The Elevator:
And one morning after days of
sleepless nights and sacriﬁce of all
eartth pleasures spent in fear of
receiving a mark not becoming
such a Gracious Greek as he. Paul
sallied forth to the elevator and
pressed the button, and he saw
that it was good, and he saw that
it did not come, and that was
normal.

 

LTIhe Way It [Is

by Ray,
Bertrand

 

 

After a week of attempted
political humor, I am compelled
to review once again political
reality. This is a task for which I
confess I am not qualified.
However, this technicality will not
thwart me, because I've examined
the qualifications of certain other
people for an endeavor much
more tedious the! mine.

Since Election Day 1968 is
today, I‘ve chosen to analyze our
candidates (better make that
“their positions." Our candidates
are way beyond the point of
possible analysis).

Let’s briefly eliminate George
Corley Wallace, who is running
primarily on a Law and Order
Platform. It would be absured to
vote for Wallace, even if you
believe in “rugged individualism”
or “survival of the whitest".

Assuming for a moment that
Wallace is elected, he will have
virtually no support in Congress.
He will be able to suggest all the
bills he wants, but let’s face it, as
far as bills are concerned, the
president’s powers are almost

exclusivelv negative ones.
If we elect George Wallace we

'll be even further dis laced

 
 
       

 

  

Don’t shut your
eyes. These people no longer want
Coca-Cola imperialism, or United

No, America!

Fruit Company imperialism.
These people, and they are
people, want independence to rule
their own destinies.

We cannot pretend Mexico City
1968 did not occur; just as we
cannot pretend Paris 1968 did not
occur. It did occur, and we as
fellow international students have
the obligation of fighting in our
own country against this same
capitalistic and imperialistic
system that suppresses our
Mexican brothers. Our brothers to
the South gave their blood for the
freedom that we Americans
cherish. Can we do less than give
them our support?

The spirit of Che Gucvcra lives
in them as it does in us. It Is not
just romanticism. It is the spirit in
all of us to be free and proud—to
have dignity and honor. But this
dream can only be accomplished
by a mass student movement in
America in conjunction with our
Latin comrades to the South.

What has happened to our
Vietnamese brothers we must not
let occur in Latin America. We
needn‘t be paranoic of the specter
of Soviet Communism; these
people are simply proclaiming to
us, to all the world~WE ARE
PEOPLE!

And we as people cannot
passively stand by and watch the
US colonial order and its puppet
governments create two or three
Vietnams in Latin America. We
must fight as we have long fought
against the imperialist war in
Vietnam.

from the goal of unifying

American theory with American
practice.

Next, we come to Hubert
Humphrey, who is running

primarily on a Law and Order
Platform.

Humphrey has been saddled by
the Johnson image in a multitude
of ways.

First let me say that Humphrey
is more liberal, dovish if Vietnam
is your bag, than the Johnson
Administration’s record indicates.
What can Mr. Humphrey do in the
White House? The painful answer
is about as much as Wallace.

Hubert Humphrey is a good
man, usually very honest for a
politician. With a favorable
congress, he could be a good,
perhaps a great president. With
the congress he will have, he will
be a pathetic sight as president.

Although I’m trying to be
objective in this column, I'll insert
a value judgment by stating that I
don't consider Mr. Humphrey to
be of presidential timber. He is an
energetic, exhuberant man who
gets a boyish thrill when things go
his way, and a dismal sulk when
they don't.

Finally, we come to Richard M.
Nixon, who is running primarily
on a Law and Order Platform.

Without any favoritism, I call
Richard Nixon the next President
of the United States, and with
favoritism, 1 add, gladly so.

Richard Nixon will be a
forceful president with a favorable
coalition congress. He has
alienated few Republicans, and
has a goodly number of
Democrats on his team.

His alledged conservatism is
actually “preservatism,” wanting
only to deepen the democratic
traditions of the United States. It
is possible that Richard Nixon will
be the best president our country
will know, but I don't think he
will be (there go, those value
judgments again).

The conservatives of the United
States have no choice. They must
either sell out to bigotry, which is
definitely not an American theory
(and we do want to be American,
don’t we, boys'!), or vote for
Richard Nixon.

The liberals of the United
States also have no choice. They
can vote for Richard Nixon and
take the chance of him keeping
his promises and securing private
enterprise for the ghettoes, or
they can waste their votes on a
man who is politically doomed.

After giving serious thought to

jumping on the Paulsen
bandwagon, I have decided to
an pport Richard Nixon for

President of the United States.

Campus Center Ballroom

 

 

 

 

And half an hour later the
elevator came, and it was good,
and he had missed half his test,
and that was not good-in fact
that was lousy. And Paul bore his
fate manfuily like the Gracious
Greek that he was, and he entered
the elevator, and it was full of
people, and the mighty elevator
slammed shut its massive doors,
and the elevator went, and the
elevator stopped, between the
thirteenth and fourteenth floors.

And the Otis man came and
removed the nails from out the
mighty motor, and opened the
doors, and saw Paul, and Paul
palled with persperation, and
lashed out in a fitful vengeance,
and consumed the Otis man. And
he then consumed TXO, and this
was good, and he received an
award for fire prevention.

Part the second: The Fire-drill:
And Paul. contemplating hf
actions of the morning showered
in his bath, and the fire-bell rang,
and this was bad. Leaping from
beneath the cascading waters, he
landed on his faithful sidekick
Straight as a Ruler Casale, who
was magically transformed into
Thin as a Tunic Tony. Searching
in vain for his apparel (for in this
land all rooms are dark) Paul
dashed to the aid of his charges,
who were fast asleep because they
hadn‘t heard the ball. And he
burst the door of 1104 to awaken
the residents therein, but found to
his chagrin, a girl therein. And he
cursed all the dwellers in this

III-lighted land, for they had been
bad, and that was not good.
Scooping up the maiden (and this
was good), lacking control, and
caning the dwellers for a not
heeding the rules, he swooped
down the stairs Into the darkness,
for there were no elevators, for it
was so ordained by the Housing
Ofﬁce, and this was stupid.

Part the third: The Suicide: But
even the greatest of the Gracious
Greeks could not long endure the
cold incurred during flameless
ﬁres, nor the narrow beds, nor the
sterile white rooms, and upon
contemplation Paul saw that all
this was bad, and rushed to the
waiting elevator (for the Gods
were merciful), and ascended to
the Penthouse.

But Paul’s frame was massive,
and the windows were small, so he
burst through the wall, but those
seeing him fall said, “Fear not, for
the insects dwelling below the
fourth floor will cushion his fall‘
(for it had been ordained by the
Stygian Stone that insects cannot
fly higher than four floors). And
on floor two a screen had failed
off, and the insects had flown in
to take the elevator to the upper
floors, and this was bad, for Paul
splattered on the earth and the
fatal radius of his ﬂying parts
slew all from here to Berkely.

Chorus: Now have you heard
the tale of that Gracious Greek, of
one who after truth did seek, and
it was good.

Chaperone Statement

Continued from 51.1

mechanics of the present policy
does not reach the core of the
situation. To lessen the number of
cases in which chaperones can be
said to be necessary raises an
important problem. We might
propose, for example, to

discontinue chaperone
requirements at picnics."

"Such a modification, which
would probably be acceptable,
implies that the University is
willing to extend responsibility in
all cases which are not critical but
that when this modiﬁcation
process reaches the cutting edge
of morality, that point at which
responsibility is most important,
the University will withhold that
responsibility and require a
chaperone.

“The core of the issue is

morality. The University should
not be allowed to limit individual
responsibility of students on any
basis, including morality."
