With Musical Illustrations

by Fran Draher

William Thomas McKinley, a
doctoral candidate at Yale who is
teaching musical composition this
semester, was to give a lecture
with musical illustrations about
early jazz on Friday, Nobember 1.
McKinley opened by saying that
jazz should be listened to instead
of spoken a out, and procededed
to give a tw hour jazz concert.

McKir. ey played thr
pianoforte; Rodger Ryan played
the percussion instrument; Roger
Cooke played the bass, and John
Lissauer played a tenor saxophone
and a ﬂute.

It was without question an
excellent concert, even for those
who knew nothing about jazz.
They began with “Chim Chim
Chiree," and went on to pieces
composed by McKinley and one
by Roger Ryan, the drummer.

Towards the end McKinley said
“We’ll just play." What followed
was total improvisation; it was
successful. Their music ranged
from loud, fast, dissonant jazz to
slow, soft music with complete
emphasis on the tempo.

The audience applauded
frequently following exceptional
persformances by individual
musicians. An informal, relaxed
atmosphere prevailed; the
Vibrations could be felt in the room
and people were nodding, tapping,
and moving in time to the music.

A question and ansWer period
followed the concert, in which
McKinley explained that there are
certain guidelines within which
the jazz player is always building;
there is a pattern of growth. The
jazz player of today is no longer
just a jazz player; he is part of an

improvisational trend in our
culture.

In a discussion of why jazz isn’t
popular today, and why people
don’t listen to it at breakfast
instead of rock n' roll, McKinley
said, ‘ No, this music doesn’t
belong over eggs and bacon." In
order to appreciate jazz, one has
to concentrate on it.

“The Skin of Our Teeth” by
'lhornton Wilder, will open in
Page Hall, tommorrow,
Wednesday, November 6th at
8:30 pm. Produced by the State
University Theatre and directed
by Martin Mann, the play will be
performed each evening through
Saturday, November 9.

All humanity is the hero,
personified in the ﬁgure of George
Antrobus. He is Adam, Noah in
fact every great hero of humanity.
He invents the wheel and the
alphabet, lives through the Fall,
the Flood and various wars, the
Ice Age and countless other
catastrophes, and yet his life
struggles on. His wife Eva bears
him two boys and a gin, but Cain
or Henry, the elder murders his
brother. A maid, Sabina, serves as
a sort of Liloth or personification
of female sensuality. The Antrobus
family is living both in prehistoric
times and in a New Jersey
commuters: suburb today. The
events of homely daily life are
depicted against the vast
dimension of time and space and
impending disaster.

In Atlantic City at the
convention of the Ancient and
Honorable Order of Mammals,
Subdivision Humans, George
Antrobus is to address thegathering
the theme of his talk being
“Enjoy Yourselves.‘

The Flood begins but the family
survives by the skin of their teeth.

Of Skin

Pag

a war has just ended. Henry or
Cain was the enemy, and Sabina
the camp-follower. George
Antrobus, the father, is now the
creative and inventive spirit in
humanity. George ever optimistic
prepares for a better world with
his weaspons: books; ideas and
human creativity. Man will
survive, says Wilder, by the
proverbial skin of his teeth, b'
why does he always operate with
so narrow a margin?

Included in the cast are: Allan
Cohen, Carol Ditosh, Margaret
Evans, Edward Kramer, Michael
Murphy,Carla Pinelli, Gary
Restifo and Judith Wiesen. Also in
the cast are: Michael Archer,
George Brust, Richard Carman,
Mary Carney, Ken Fisher, Dan

Maserek, Scot Regan, Gila Slavin,
Patrick Stum, Richard Topper,
Barbara Untract, and Susan

production is Jay Hershokowitz.
Assistant Stage Manager is Barbara
Simon.

Director Martin Mann feels the
play is pertinent for todays‘s
unstable world perhaps with a
different emphasis than was the
case in 1942. The timeless nature
of the play allows each generation
to view through the eyes of their
own times a portrait of mankind
which has managed to survive
various crises even if only by the
skin of his teeth.

APA CAPTURED the League I football title this Saturday as they
squeaked out a 13-12 victory over STB. photo by Potskowrki

APA Captures Title
Defeats STB 13-12

by Dave F ink

What amounted to be the
climatic game of the League I
season was played this Saturday.
APA, with an unblemished record
of 11-0, needed a win over STB,
with zi3 -]»1 record, to capture the
title.

In the opening minutes, It
seemed that both offenses would
dominate play. APA received the
kickoff and began to move
immediately on completions from
Gary Torino to flanker Lance
Brofsky and then to tight end
Denny Elkin.

But this drive was stifled on an
alert interception by Larry Meyers

01' STB. Meyers, now at
quarterback, wasted no time.
While getting good pass

protection, he was unable to find
a receiver and thus ran with the
ball for two first downs. A
completion to Mike Puvy gave
3TB the ball at the APA 25 yard
line.

Now, STB was stopped on an
interception by Jack Sinnott.
APA evidently was not to be
denied again as they drove
downfield on some line running
by Torino and two fine catches by
Brofsky. Torino scored on an end
sweep giving APA a ’I-0 load.

If anyone calmed down after
this touchdown, they were soon
screaming as STB’H Larry Smith

returned the ensuring kickoff for
a touchdown, cutting APA’s lead
to 7-5.

APA got the ball, but
immediately lost it when Mike
Golub of STB intercepted and ran
it back 60 yards for a touchdown
putting STB in the lead 12—7. APA
received the kickoff and moved
down to the STB one yard line
before they were held on a
fantastic goal line stand.

STB took over but a Meyers'
pass was intercepted on the 50
yard line. APA scored after a fine
run by Torino, on a pass to Ellrin
to make the score 13-12 at the
half.

The score remained the same
until late in the fourth quarter
when Meyers intercepted a Torino
pass and ran it buck to the APA
30 yard line. lie promptly hit Jay

.Iirn Shear, a junior, put in the first Albany goal at 4:05 in the first quarter. Ron Spratl followed in the
' , . . 7. middle of the second quarter.

The Great Danes then held
Stony Brook, almost shutting
them out, until a screen drew

:3} Albany goalie Terry Jordan from

the net and an opposition goal
was scored late in the last quarter.

Coach Schifflein cited center
fullback Craig Springer for his
“best defensive game ever" and
also praised Joel Volinski, Alan
Rosenberg, and Ed Campbell for
their performances.

The Albany defense turned one
of its best showings all season,
allowing only four goal attempts.

The team finished with a 3-6-1
record, but coach Schifflein
expects a better season next year
because his ‘green" sophomores
and juniors will have had the
experience of competing against
rough teams the calibre of RPI
and New Paltz.

Jim Shear led the Albany squad
in season scoring with eight goals.
Ron Spratt scored six times and
John Compeau had three.
