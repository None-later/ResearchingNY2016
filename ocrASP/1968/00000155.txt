Senate has decided to recommend that the University not institute a

0mm
One of the members of the Senate objected to the implementation of

a football team on the grounds that the money which would be

expended for such an endeavor might be put to better use in other

areas. The contender was that it is more important to spend money

either for more professors or for higher salaries for those already

employed.

A second rationale offered by the Senate was that they did not want

to see Albany become a “football school.” Many of the faculty

members felt that the ‘nception of football would reduce Albany to a

school known only for its football prowess. The idea is that Albany will

have its hard fought for academic rating overshadowed by the football

team.

I ﬁnd both of these rationales rather difficult to digest. Neither

argument, upon inspection holds water.

For years, the Athletic Advisory Board has been building up a fund

for the express purpose of ﬁnancing a football team. This money has

come from the students themselves through an athletic tax, part of the

student tax which all students must now pay. Consequently, the
fomiation of a football team will not take away from the professors.

The addition of more professors of the increasing of salaries for

professors will not be hindered by the fomiation of a football team.

The second argument offered by the Senate seems completely

absurd. The idea that Albany will become an athletic school devoid of

academic excellence is_nonsensical for several reason. Number one,
without scholarships, a football team would never be able to reach a

reputation large enough to overshadow the academic achievements of

the school. Number two, there is certainly evidence that a school can

sport a football team and still maintain a high academic reputa tion

(any Ivy League school, for instance)

The formation of a football team would undoubtedly serve to

increase school spirit, an emotion which is somewhat nonexistent at

Albany. A football team would undoubtedly draw a larger crowd than

our soccer team presently attracts. Last year, a poll revealed that the

students were overwhelmingly in favor of the inception of a football

The arguments against a football team seem somewhat weak, the

students are overwhelmingly in favor of it, it could not hurt the school,

so 1 say, Why not a football team? President Collins has the last say of

whether or not a provision in the plans for next year for the

organization of a team, so l appeal to him and say, Why not do the

student body a favor and allow them what they want. a football teamv

Ron Stonitsch won the Albany invitational a week ago, their ﬁrst

Stonitsch, who set the course record in the Invitational, also won the race Saturday completing the ﬁve

miles in 26:49. Angelo Rivituso, who ﬁnished third in the invitational, followed Stonitch across the ﬁnish

line for Post.

The Great Danes proved to
have too much depth for Post,
however, as the next seven
runners were Albany runners.

Larry Frederick followed the
two Post ninners across the line to
finish third in the race. Following
Frederick were Paul .Roy, Pat
Gepfcrt, Paul Breslin, George
Rolling, Don Beavers, and Jim
Mastromarchi.

Once again, the harrierl

enabled them to win many of
their meets this year. Even with

Nixon’s Victory :
An Analytic View

by Dan Sabin
ASP New Analyst

“Winning is slot more fun.” So
said Richard M. Nixon, 37th
President of the United States, as
he reminiscenced about the long
struggle from his close loss of
1960, to his even closer win of
1968.

For Nixon, his election
represented years of hard work.
effort, and diligence. He was
therefore dissappointed by the
outcome of this election.
probably the closest one in
American history with 94 per
cent of the vote in, the media
reported Nixon ahead by an
amazing 375 Ihousandlhs of] per
cent.

Even in the electoral college
Nixon did poorly by winning only
a small majority. In several states
he won by pluralities only, as he
did in the country at large. Such a
poor score means trouble.

And Nixon will have trouble. in
national trends he lost the cities,
labor, and the black and
low-income vote, he barely won
California, losl. New York, and
even lost. his V.P.‘s state of
Maryland.

More significantly, Nixon was
unable to spread his coattails. In
the Senate races, the Republicans
remained in the minority by 16
seats; in the House the Democrats

held a 51 vote majority.
Obviously, the Republican
President is not going to find

Republican enthusiasm in his
Congress.

A recalcitrant Congress and a
split and very volatible public are
thus not only the two most
significant results of this election,
but mean also two terrible
headaches for the new President.
if anything has emerged as
outstanding in this remarkable
year, it is that the election solved
none of the problems facing this
troublednation, and indeed, may
have only exacerbated them.

What is more, no one knows
what Nixon plans to do. He has
campaigned in the old style of
promising everything to
everybody, and pledged such

A meeting has been scheduled
for November 15, l p.m. in the
Humanities Faculty Lounge (HU
354), to discuss and distribute
information concerning the
program at Nice. The program is
under the direction of Associate
Dean Charles Colman, former
Head of the Department of
Romance Languages,
Nicolopoulos, Coordinator of
international Studies.

Freshmen, as well as all other
interested studentes, are urged to
attend so that they may plan their

new schedules with specific
requirements in mind.
The program in France,

sponsored by the State University
of New York, selects 10 studean
from each of the four university
centers to spend a year at the
University of Nice. it offers those
majoring in French and others
who are qualified, an excellent
opportunity to improve their
knowledge of the French
language, culture, and way of life.

France is indeed the pivotal

students to have closed doors
during open houses.

This bill is supported by a seven
page rationale. The four-part
rationale is composed of
statements and policies from
various sources.

The rationale is based heavily
on students’ rights and
responsibilities. It is felt that,
“Our University is committed to
recognizing maturity.’ it is
assumed that students will
“formulate their own ideals and
standards.”

“Obedience to a meaningless
rule conditions nothing more than
obedience to a rule. The present
residence regulations are not a
challenge; they do not stimulate
individual growth, thought and
action. Education is a life-time
process which is a vital part of all
human development. ‘ How can a
University educate when the
students place restrictions upon
education?”

“Students should be allowed L0
determine their own limitations.
They should become thoroughly
acquainted with the ideals of
individual and group
responsibility and freedom.”

MYSKANIA has taken the
position that “the curfew system
imposed on freshmen women has
no rational basis and ought to be
abolished." They feel that the
present system is "self-defeating
in its avowed objective," which is
to acclimate freshmen women to
the University.

The above proposals were
discussed by LAAC Wednesday,
but because of the lack of
information before the living area
ruling body, the four statements
were sent back to committee after
a two and a half hour debate. It is
expected that LAAC will act on
this bill next Wednesday in HU
132 at 7 p.m.

panelists. Moderating was Bill
Rohde.

Evans was the first to speak. He
felt that a definition of welfare
was necessary and proceeded to
define it as not only the fulfilling
of material need but also as
freedom from control of the state
over the individual‘s life.

He stated that it was the latter
type of welfare that is diminishing
in our country today. He used
welfare workers as an example,
saying that they ‘ nose around in
the affairs of people whom they
are supposed to be helping."

Next lsemun spoke, stressing
the fact that many people believe
that welfare is in human right
rather than u privilege. llc
interpreted the right to property
to mean the right to pursue
property. When one works and
cums property, then he owns it.

lscmun objected to welfare on
the grounds that the government
forces the majority of people to
work it ccrtuln amount of time to
support those on welfare.

Following lscmun was l’olluck
who said that the stulc thinks it
has the right to make decisions for
people hecuusc it grunts them
economic and social welfare.

He also brought up the point

that society assumes responsibility
because it sets certain standards,
such as auto safety standards and
laws having to do with the
controlling of air pollution.
Pollack feels that the rules of
our society ensure that some
people will have decent housing,
food, and clothing, while others
will not. "The things people want
should be theirs without
qualification, without control or
decisions not made by them."
The fourth to speak wus
Rawson, who posed the question,
‘ Why are there poor?" it is not
because there are rich, because

there are insufﬁcient welfare
funds, because there aren't
enough jobs or schools, nor

because of the terrorizution of the
poor by the police.

He said that the state line
usurped the right of the people to
make decisions and that the poor
must reverse this.

Summing up, the YAF and EDS
found that they agreed that
through grunting welfare, the
govornment has gone too far in
making decisions for the
individual. The poor cannot rely
more on the government to fulfill
their needs but must guin their
rights, forcibly, if necessary,
through the structure of the law.
