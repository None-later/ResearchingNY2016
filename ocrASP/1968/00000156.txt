Nixon May Appoint

Rocky

CHICAGO (UPI)—President-
elect Richard M. Nixon “may
appoint” Los Angeles Dist.

Atty. Evelle J. Younger as his
attorney general, the Chicago
Daily News said Thursday.

In a story by William
McGaffin of the newspaper’s
Washington bureau datelined

Key Biscayne, Fla.-where Nix-
on is resting—the Daily News
said Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of
New York, Gov. George Rom-
ney of Michigan and Gov. John
Volpe of Massachusetts might
be in a Nixon cabinet.

The newspaper said Younger,
50, “has been high on the list of
possible attorney generals in a
Nixon administration" since the
campaign started.

(In Los Angeles, Younger said
he would “probably find it
impossible to say no" if offered
the post. He said, however, he
had not talked with anyone
replesenting Nixon since the
election.)

The Daily News said “some

To Cabinet

sources had suggested" Rocke-
feller might be Nixon’s defense
secretary. “However, it '
believed that Rockefeller will
not join the cabinet because it
is feared there would be too
much friction between him and
Nixon," the newspaper said.

The newspaper also said it
had been speculated that
Romney might be named
secretary of commerce and
Volpe might be offered eithter
the secretaryship of health,
education and welfare or
secretary of the Transportation
Department office.

C. Douglas Dillon, former
secretary of state and secretary
of the Treasury, and William
Scranton, former Pennsylvania
governor, are “under considera—
tion for secretary of state," the
Daily News said.

(In Scranton, Pa., Scranton
said he has told advisers to
Nixon he is “not available for
any position in the federal
government."

composed of active students
interested in promoting
traditional and innovations]
campus activities.

They try to organize events
which will present a variety of
entertainment on campus, and
give all students an opportunity to
use their talents and abilities.

The Board itself came into
existence with the New Campus.
It inherited the built-up traditions
of over one hundred years of
school activities.

After discarding the theory that
the Board had to operate under
the old traditions, the menmberl
proceeded to formulate new
events to suit our University.

Like any group operating under
the shadow of well established
tradition, the Board has several
problems.

According to one member, the
greatest of these is the uncaring
attitude of today’s students. They
can't be expected to have the
same feeling as the students of the

past, because we are now a
University.
With the change from the

traditional view, the Board has
attempted to give the general
student body a greater chance to

several large events; the Spring
Semi-formal, Jazz Festival,
Parents' Weekend, and Campus
Carnival-State Fair.

All of these events are geared to
meet the needs of the University
student, and give him a return on
his student tax.

Special Events Board is
composed of less than forty
people, who must coordinate the
above events and more.

In an effort to acquaint the
student body with the purposes
and workings of the Board, it has
been sponsoring a number of open
meetings.

These informal gatherings allow
interested students to meet the
Board members and find out what
they want to do on campus.

The next of these meetings will
be at 4:30 this Sunday, November
10, in the Campus Center
Ballroom. There will be free soda
and a cash bar; those wishing to
bring up food from the Snack Bar
are encouraged to do so.

Debaters from the University
won 16 out of 20 debates at the
Fifth Annual Dutchman F’orensic
Classic Tournament at

Pennsylvania during last weekend.

According to Jeanine Rice,
director of Forensics, “Posting an
eighty percent win‘iose record for
our first tournament of the year
in light of the strong competition
is an outstanding performance by
our squad."

‘ Two of the University's teams
were undefeated in the

Many of these appear likely to
alienate the liberals and
Democrats in Congress, and more
importantly, may force Nixon to
work with Strom ’l‘h‘urmond
Republicans and southern
Democrats.

As for Humphrey, a man who
forged a phenomenal photo finish,
it appears to be the end of a
distinguished career. ll. seems
ironic that the men who were
most instrumental ill winning his
nomination, Mayor Daley and
LBJ, may also have been most
responsible for his defeat in the
election.

As for Mr. Wallace, it is clear he
failed. By his poor showing, he
has proved once again, that third
parties can do little more than
scare, rather than alter, the status
quo, Yet it is llignificant that
Wallace appeared on the ballots ()f
every state lllld, as a result,
opened paths for new political
influences.

Looking back, none can deny
that this has been a most exciting,
interesting, and even tragic year.
For many people, politics has
