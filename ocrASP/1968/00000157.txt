The signiﬁcance of the Republican success in
the contest for the presidency and that of the
Republican triumph in Albany County is not the
same. We were in a position, this year, to see a
classic example of the diversity allowed beneath

one party label.

The national Republican party chose to
reinstate an old order in Miami, which was older
than that of Johnson-Humphrey, and barely won
the presidency. In Albany, however, the old order,
which is the 48 year old Democrat machine, fell
victim to a new order, the Albany County

Republican Party.

The election of Richard Nixon, as tenuous as it
was, seems to signal a change back to the days
before Kennedy. His election is not tantamount to
national disaster, but because of his seemingly
inability to visualize meaningful change Richard
Nixon is capable of leading this country into
deeper domestic and foreign trouble, than it is in
now. Nixon’s election is a victory of, l)ut not a
mandate for, the conservative forces in the United

States today.

 

Tax Defended

To the Editor:

This letter is written in
response to the various protests
that have sprung up as a result of
the outcome of the recent student
tax referendum.

In response to the petition that
is presently being circulated, it
should be pointed out that the
first statement of that document
is fallacious. The election
commissioner and assistant
election commissioner report that
no one who appeared at the polls
was denied his right to vote.
Approximately twelve students
who had not received their
validation cards did appear at the
polls. All were told to wait until
the last day of voting, on the
chance that their cards might
arrive. When the cards did not
arrive these people were allowed
to vote anyway, with a corner
being shipped of their I.D. cards.

Admittedly there were more
than twelve university students
who still had not received their
validation cards, however, if these

people had wanted to vote, the
logical thing for them to do would
have been to approach the
election ofﬁcials and find out
what could be done about the
situation. About twelve people
did this and all were allowed to
vote.

Secondly, the athletic portion
of the activities fee has always
been there, and has In Albany's
history always been a part of the

student assessment, and as such
deserves no more special attention
than did the fact that Community
Programming Commission is
getting $86,633 of student
money, while Communications
Commission is getting $61,166.
On the question of the clarity
of the referendum's objectives, I
feel that it was made sufficiently
clear, to all those who bothered to
read the ASP, that the referendum
was indeed, a binding vote of the
student body, and not an opinion

0 .
The fourth point made on the
petition is one which I feel needs
clarification. The petitioners claim
that a 2/3 majority should have
been required since a mandatory
assessment is a restriction of basic
student liberties. My question is
what student liberties are being
restricted? The entire student
body voted to impose upon itself
a mandatory fee, which is entirely
in keeping with democratic
principles. Nowhere that 1 know
of is there a rcquirement of a 2/3
majority for a group of people to
impose a charge, upon themselves,
whether that charge be a fee, a
tax, or merely membership dues.

Bru Bugs

To the Editor:

1 am a graduate student who
lives on the first floor of
Brubacher Hail. Like most of the

 
 

 
  
   

other residents on my wing, 1 have
had to tolerate cockroaches,
spiders, and other insects since the
day I moved into this building.

The exterminators came in
early October to spray this
building. However, apparently

they did not do a very thorough
iob because the roaches and the
other creatures have still been
running around here.

I mentioned the problem to
Mrs. Edith Gramm, Director of
Brubacher Hall, the other night.
She said she would get the
exterminators to spray again. 1
hope they do u better job this
time and evict the bugs.

in desperation and disgust, I
purchased a can of Black Flag ant
and roach killer and sprayed my
room. 1 really (lid not appreciate
the small, but since 1 do not
appreciate the presence of the
roaches, i had little choice, At
least when 1 sprayed, the smell
told me 1 had used something to

evict the roaches. When the
cxterminatons came last month
and sprayed, 1 could smell
nothing.

My spraying my room will not
help if the bugs have a nest in the
hall or in the building.

Something definitely must be
done about this situation. No one
should have to tolerate roaches
and other insects simply because
these are disease-breeders. I came
to Albany State to study for the
degree of Master of Library
Science, not to live with roaches.

The Way

llit lls

 

 

 

The election. I know. But I've
decided not to fill my column

with trivia this week. A “State of
the World" message is long
overdue.

This message will not be

hearing good tidings. We have
problems, none of which are very
serious since the world is doomed

anyway. The questions we must
ask only deal with how we spend
the last human years on earth.
Some fools will tell you our

destruction can be postponed.
They‘re idiots. We’ve already
destroyed ourselves.

Our first problem is we have
three major races. two of which
are inferior (it doesn’t matter
which two, as long as yours isn’t
in the category). And inferior

objects must be hated. Don’t
bother asking yourself how
they’re inferior or why they
should be hated, becuase I’m
certain you‘ll find reason. The
world is doomed!

Our second problem is that we
get hungry. We get hungry for
food, which is, in economic terms,
scarce. We get hungry for land
which is scarce. Some of us get
hungry for blood. Why? There’s
always a good reason . The world
is doomed!

Our third, and most important
problem is that we are people,
stupid beings implied in the
definition. We align ourselves

politically in order to best do
what is fair. The only basic
difference between right and left
is who takes what from whom.
People always have to take.

Let’s take a brief glance at the

situation throughout the
magnificent globe we call home,
continent by continent.

ANTARTICA: Virtually no
problems; however, virtually no
people, Minor problems between
the United States and the Soviet
Union, due to minor contact
between the United States and the
Soviet Union. Perhaps the most
tranquil place in the world to live.
Keep it that way. Keep out.

AUSTRALIA: Nice place.
Good climate. l-ligh standard of
living. Good deal of elbow room.
No “niggers” allowed in the
country. Really great when the
only way to maintain good
relations with others is to
maintain no relations at all. Really
gives man a good deal of credit.
Immoral realism is sacrificing, or
perhaps ignoring, humanity, in
state of mind the world hasn't yet
reached. Maybe we can do it. in
the little time left.

AFRICA: Union of South
Africa and Rhodesia less subtle
than Australia. Nigerians are

people too. liinfra's dying. Nasser
reminds me of Hitler, Is he really
deud'.’ Portugal "owns" the people
of Angola and Mozambique.
'l‘ypical continent. No further
comment,

EUROPE: lliis three countries
with little strife. llowcvur,
Andorra, Leichtcnstcin, and
Luxembourg haven't spread their
cultures and values very well. West
and East Germnay, dc Gaullc,
CzechOslovakin, Gomulku,
Ulbricht, France, Greece,
Romania. How I wouldn't like to
spend my summer vacation.

ASIA: Russia-China.
India-China. ChinavChina.
Vietnam. Hong Kong. Macao.
Indonesia. Starvation. Holy cow.
Jews. Arabs. Arms race. Great
place to visit, but I wouldn't want
to die there. Sand. Oil, Mud. Rice.

LATIN AMERICA: Army
coups. Dictators. Che. Cuba".
Castro. Students. Dominican
Republic. Duvalier.
Hyperinﬂation. They do look to
the United States after all.

NORTH AMERICA: Been
around, pal?

What can we do in the final
minutes? The “we” is collective,
for it is imperative that this be a
collective action. Crusaders won’t
do it. They are too few.

Live your life. Discover
humanity in yourself. If you can’t
love at first, be tolerant. Don’t
kill. ﬂying is the easiest way to get
killed. It's much more painful to
be killed and still live.

Living a life isn’t simple. It’s
easier to be an animal. Ask the
next one you meet. Prove me
wrong. The world is doomed!

 

Dear Student,

Today, our nation has many
serious problems. On the domestic
scene, we are faced with a rise in
civil disorders and crime.
Situations in our foreign affairs
which merit consideration must
include Sino—American relations
(relations with the People’s
"' r “' on the ' ' ",), the
“war” in Viet Nam, and the
inefﬂcacy of the United Nations,
as a truly international body, on
almost every level.

These problems, and many
others of equal importance, elicit
a powerful, largely reactionary
response from much of the voting
public, many of whom suffer
from the lack of an adequate and
continuing education. This
reactionary trend is seriously
widening a social and political gap
between segments of our
population, which in turn must

inevitably lead to even greater
upheavals. That our nation can
survive a series of increasingly
severe crises as a viable element in
the gar-wing international
community is very doubtful.

We are now being given, on
nearly every level from the fondly
up to the Federal government,
, ,’ " ' ' material which tends
to foster, not disperse, hate,
bigotry, and violence; on both the
internal and international levels.
To continue to grow as a. truly
democratic entity, we must
reverse the direction of this
“hardening of the mental
arteries."

1, as a concerned individual, am
asking you, as another individual,
to assist in reversing our present
trend towards hate and violence. I
have several suggestions toward
this improvement; the most
important of which is the

Doubts about rushing? They’re
only natural. Okay, you say to
yourself, I‘ve paid my registration
fee and I've started going to the
open houses-but is it really all
worth it? What is a Greek? What

does he do?
We realize that many of you
probably feel this way; you

wonder about your marks and if
they will suffer, and you ask how
you can benefit from being a
Greek. We want to help you
answer these questions the best
way we know how. And probably
the best answer we can give is to
refer to Homecoming;
Homecoming of any year reﬂects
a great deal of what the sororities
and fraternities are really doing
and. what they mean, and two
specific examples are the floats
and the Scholarship Cup awarded
each year.

We chose these examples
because we feel that each depicts
a certain phase of Greek life. And
we think that probably the most
important part of being a Greek is
the interaction with other people

 

Princeton beat Brown in
football last Saturday, 50-6. If our
faculty worry about
over-emphasis in football has any
substance, then we must assume
that Princeton is simply an
athletic school with no academic
accomplishments.

helps bring together these
ideas- aswell as the people. It 's not

Float" that counts, when you
come right down to it: it's the
spirit and participation and pride

For the most part, this year’s

work and imagination-and if not
a lot of work, then at least a lot of
spirit! And this is the essence of a
sorority or fraternity: spirit.

Even though several well
constructed ﬂoats were entered
by non-Greek groups, the main
portion of the parade came from
the Greeks, which goes to show
one just where the true spirit is.
From the conception of the idea

how we learn responsibilitiy, how
we function as a whole. It’s really

all boils down to is group spirit
sustained by individual efforts; it‘s
a sense of pride a Greek
organization can provide for you.
And that's a lot.

Many rushees feel that pledging
is a signal for their marks to drop.
that the group will hurt the
individual. Not so. It’s not the
group, but the individual and his
attitude towards his work that
makes or breaks him.

Doubts about rushing? They're
only natural; you have to face up
to them in order to be really sure
of yourself. Maybe we’ve helped
you, and maybe we haven't. But
while you’re thinking about it,
why not look around and give us a
chance anyway?’:“

 

 

   

broadening of the scope of our
educational system, from
elementary school up to college
and establishing a code of
academic freedom for the
instructors and students in these
institutions. I propose that this
system should include more
emphasis on interaction, between
both nations and individuals, a
fairer assessment of minority
group contributions to society,
and a less ethnocentrically (U.S.)

oriented view of the
contemporary world. I further
suggest that our system be

revamped to guarantee a more
liberal, continuing education to all
people; regardless of their race,
creed, color, sex or economic
background.

I would also like to see an
effort toward diplomatic
recognition of the various
f‘ ’ countries which we
don't at present recognize, and
their inclusion in the United
Nations.

In closing, I will say that this
letter is not meant to encourage
your support of any specific
legislative or judicial action
pending at this time. Rather, I
would say that I am soliciting
your help in making our country;
our world, a better place to live
