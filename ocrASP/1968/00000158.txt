Woodwind Quintet:

Superb

Paula Camardclll
Music council really deserves a
round of applause for their

presentation of the Philadelphia
Woodwind Quintet last Sunday.
The performance can only be
described as professionalism at its
best. '
The selections covered a range
of three centuries: Francesco
Rosetti (Franz Anton Rossier)
18th Century, Carl Nielsen, 19th
century, and Irving Fine and
Adalbert Markovic, 20th century.
It was evident from the very
ﬁrst note that the performance
would be superb. They showed a
perfect balance of tone among the
instruments, executing each note
delicately, and yet with clarity.
Special attention to the
dynamics and expression of
phrase groupings was particularly
good, especially in the two
modern pieces by Fine and
Markovic. Modern composers
demand rapt attention to pathos,
or emotional sensitivity to their
pieces, because rhythmic
experimentation, dissonance, and

Musicians

contrpl of dynamics are so
important to the success of their
compositions.

Probably the most impressive
quality which the group had was
msterful control of each
instrument. The French Horn
player constantly showed precise
intonation, and the clarinet player
should be commended for his fine
phrase endings.

The rapport that the group
established with the audience was
a welcome change. They did not
present themselves as stiff,
long-hair professionals, but rather
as warm, sensitive artists who
enjoyed being here, and playing
for the audience. I specifically
refer to Mr. Mason Jones, the
horn player, who is indeed a very
charming gentleman to meet.

If the audience showed a tiny
bit of boredom after an hour and
a half, the encore really socked it
to ‘em, because everybody left the
concert whistling and humming
the melody--fur wrapped ladies as
well as students. All in all it was
an admirable performance.

ALBANYum

Last week was not a prodigious
one for local movies. I regret
having missed “The Swimmer,"
about which I heard enough
mixed opinion to pique my
interest. I don't regret having
missed “Barbarella” (“See
Barbarella Do Her Thingl”) and
“Therese and Isabelle’ (“A Sizzler
from France!... Starring Easy
Per-sson (‘I a Woman’)...A Radley
Metzger Production").

Call it dogmatism, but these are
some movies from which I shy
away instinctively, even if there
are no other movies around. The
only game in town isn’t
necessarily worth playing.

Instead, I’m going to talk about
Francois Truffaut and his “Shoot
the Piano Player," to be shown
tonight at IFG. Now if it seems
that I spend a lot of time on
French ﬁlms, it's because the
French cinema strikes me as the
most interesting in the world
today.

Italy has Antonioni, Fellini,
Pasolini, and Bertolucci; in
England, there's Richardson,
Clayton, and Lester; Hollywood,
as far as I can see, can only brag
about Hitchcock, Polanski.

But mainly, the French cinema
constitutes the richest lot of all.

Truffaut began his film career
as a critic (hence the often
hermetic references and in-jokes
in his and other New Wave films).
This is typical of what Stanley
Kauffman calls the “film
generation”—young people
steeped in ﬁlms from their
childhood, who never saw the
inside of a studio but were
convinced that one could learn all
about movies simply by watching
them.

Traditionally, film directors
have come from the theatre,
television, or the industry itself;
but in France in the middle fifties,
directors began to enter film
production from the ranks of the
amateur but informed audience.
This gave their ﬁlms a wonderful
zest, a playful sense of love for
this magical art form, that
sparkles in "Breathless," “The
400 Blows," and “Zazie dans le
Metro.’

The French New Wave style (an

offhand, improvisatory feel, a
genial disregard for cinematic
convention) was highly
influential, but perhaps more

importantly the movement served
as an example of what exciting
cinema young "untrained" people
could make when they got the
chance.

Truffaut's first major ﬁlm,
‘The 400 Blows.’ was
unobtrusively unconventional and
won a huge international
following. “Shoot the Piano
Player,” his second, was overtly
iconoclastic and gratified neither
audiences nor critics.

Why? ‘Piano Player" makes us
nervous. Truffaut’s anarchism,
seen in content and attitude in
"The 400 Blows," becomes part
and parcel of his style in “Piano
Player"—and confounds

traditional expectations about
mood, tone, and plot. In the
middle of a serious scene, a
gangster says, “May my mother
drop dead if I’m lying"; quick
shot of his mother dropping dead.

In the middle of a comic
gunfight, a girl is suddenly killed.
These shifts, which can make one
so uneasy, are the essence of
Truffaut’s purpose.

For Truffaut's vision of life
focuses on the ambivalence of
situations—how something
pathetic may have funny
overtones, how an act committed
out of good intentions can have
evil consequences. From the
mixture of such disparate
elements we get a sense of an
almost Shakespearian richness:
high style and low, vice and
virtue, lyricism and violence, and
comedy and pathos clash not in a
pat, logical way, but in the
awkward unexpectedness of life as
we live it.

The anti-hero is Charlie
(underplayed with fragile
sharpness by Charles Aznavour), a
former concert pianist playing in a
Parisian bistro. He's cutoff from
life, wants no involvement with
people, no

Walks alone.

But hesitantly, fumblingly, he
falls in love with a waitress.
Meanwhile, his gangster brother is
being pursued by rival crooks with
an order to kill. After
innumerable bits of business,
slapstick, and side~gags, the two
plots collide—and Charlie returns
alone to his piano.

As in ‘ The 400 Blows," the last
shot is ambiguous: a close~up of
Charlie at the keyboard, his
chaplinesque eyes filling with
tears, as he ripples out his tough,
jaunty tune.

characteristically, Truffaut lets
us down gently, lingering on this
image of a man who wants
nothing so much as to deny his
humanity and yet cannot. The
title comes from the signs that
used to hang in Old West saloons:
“Don't Shoot the the Piano
Player"—presumably because he‘s
got to keep the music going for
the rest of us.

It’s this complicated amalgam
of sympathy, lyricism, comedy,
and moral earnestness that makes
"Shoot the Piano Player‘ one of
the most affecting ﬁlms I‘ve ever
seen.

Coffee House Circuit
Wants Student Talent

The Campus Center Governing
Board has announced that the
third scheduled Coffeehouse
Circuit will feature ‘Sounds
Unlimited." The trio, which now
goes by the name, “Erica, Eros
and Young," will appear from
Monday, December 2, through
Saturday, December 7. This is the
second appearance at SUNY for
the talented group. Last spring
they performed before crowds of
appreciative students who rarely
let them off the stage without
several encores. Tentativer
scheduled for this January is Don
Crawford, who has performed
before enthusiastic audiences at
Keuka College.

Janis Ian, Alan King
At RPI Field House

Alan King, master gangster from
Brooklyn, Janis Ian, petite young
folk singer, appear at the R.P.I.
Field House on Friday, Novr-mbEr
8 at 8:30 p.m. as part of the
R.P.I. Military Weekend.

Famed for his quick wit and
glib tongue, King moves into the
Field House as one of the most
popular of the present comics.

The slick quipstcr who made
his start as a drummer with a
four-piece band now is a regular

on the top ’l‘.V. slioWs, sorted in
hit on Broadway in “The
Impossible Years" and is a
favorite on the supper club

circuit. King is as busy as he is
popular.

King has dedicated much of his
time recently to raising $500,000
which he has pledged toward
construction of the Alan King
Medical Center in Jerusalem.

What humorous tuck he will
take at the Field House remains to
be seen and heard. No need to say
here he will be welcomed at the
Field House. The fans have their
own way of saying it.

Janis writes all of her own
songs, and has been asked by
many people to classify them. She
classifies her songs, if that is really
necessary, as ‘people sketches."
Jan Is not out to crucify anyone,

nor to spare them. People who are
cynical play a great role in her

songs. Her songs are easy listening

for a "Liberal" audience.

Jan’s start in show business was

New ‘Skin’ Version,

Succeeds By

Thornton Wilder’s “The Skin
Of Our Teeth,’ which runs thru
November 9 at Page Hall, has been
given a new, very contemporary
look by directror Martin Mann,
but these original attempts to
update the old play serve no
practical purpose because the play
itself is virtually timeless.

Mann, by concentrating on
,each act rather than trying
ito intergrate the parts into' a
smooth t'lowrng whole, has turned
“The Skin Of Our Teeth' into
three short one‘act plays.

By doing this, the important
character development of the
Antrobus family badly suffers.
Henry Antrobus, who in Act I is a
mischievous child often struck by
his father for no obvious reason,
becomes in Act III the
personification of evil. Mann, by
making each act an independent
entity, makes it difﬁcult for the
audience to connect Henry‘s
youthful slingshot days to his
later gun carrying days.

Mann overcomes this basic flaw
in the production by moving his
large and talented cast around the
stage with the precision and grace
of a ﬁnely executed dance
routine. The Atlantic City
convention in the second act is an
absolute delight to watch as Mann
makes his actors appear and
disappear as if by magic.

Since the play is laden with
long dialogue passages, a heavy
burden is placed upon the actors.
Michael Murphy as Mr. George
Antrobus generally does a good
job of portraying the inventor of
the alphabet, the wheel, and the
multiplication system; however,
he tends to replace genuine acting
with quite a bit of shouting and

stomping.

Judith Ann Weisen (Mrs.
Antrobus), displays considerable
ability as she delivers a long
speech at the Atlantic City
convention. Wearing a frumpy

blue flowered hat and a frumpy

Teeth

ray Gary Oslo
blue dress, she tells the delegatnl
that a tomato is edible.

Carla Pinelli, as Siblns, and
Carol Di Tosti as the fortune
teller, are standouts. Sabina, clad
in a green leather outfit which
somehow makes her look like a
car hop eagerly bringing
hamburgers and french fries to
hungry patrons, represents female
sensuality. Carol Di Tosti,
predicting the great flood in a
deep voice and thick accent helps
make Act II as good as it is.

This particular version of "The
Skin Of Our Teeth” would be far
more absorbing if it were not so
similar to Jean-Claude Van
Itallie's ‘ America Hurrah" which
consists of three, short, highly
symbolic one-act plays.

Both plays place a great deal of
emphasis on lighting, slides
projected on the wall, and music
to close each act.

Mann also employs the same
total and abrupt silence, so
effectively used in the Van Itallie
play. This is particularly
noticeable at the end of the
second act as Antrobus, directed
by the fortune teller, attempts to
excape the impending deluge. The
stage is a mass of activity as
Antrobus shouts for his family
and the fortune teller shouts her
prophecy, while the convention
delegates are sprawled all over the
floor with the Atlantic City
prostitutes they have picked up.

Mann {Closed the Wednesday
night performance of the play
with the cast handing out
newspapers, which proclaimed
Richard Nixon as President, to the
audience. This is perhaps the most
ingenious of the many
unnecessary additions to the play,
for it without a doubt brings the
theme right up to today. As we
have endured the great disasters
(by the skin of our teeth, of
course), we will so endure the
next four years.
