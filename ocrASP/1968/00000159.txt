Thursday, November 21.

competition.

winning team.

Larry Frederick, who has been

throughout the season, followed
Horey across the line. Paul Roy,
Don Beevers, and Paul Breslin
were the next three ﬁnishers for
Albany.

This year, the barriers suffered
their only two losses to teams
from Coast Guard and Colgate. In
addition to their dual meet
record, Albany also placed fifth in
the LeMoyne Invitational while
third in their own
Invitational.

Throughout the year, the
team‘s success has derived not so
much from an overpowering ﬁrst

steady performances from the

This fall, the freshman soccer

were performing.

Vice-President for
Affairs Clifton C.
President's Conference with
Students in the
President Evan R. Collins.

Thorne discussed with students

the problems of University
transportation and announced the
dedication service to be held for
the Library.

It was noted that an
announcemenl was made that the
University buses would no longer
stop at Washington and Main.
Thorne justified this change by
stating “We have made an
agreement with the United
'I‘ranction to bus members of the
University to our installations
only.”

Until this semester the
University Computer Center was
located in the Reserve Building at
the location in question.

However, a large number of
inquiries were directed to the
office of Student Affairs
concerning the matter.

Thorne noted that many
students acquired apartments near
the Reserve Center thinking that
they could ride the University bus
to the new campus.

“As a result we have cancelled
the announcement. At present the
bus now stops at that stop; we
will look into the matter further
in the future,” stated Thorne.

Dedication of the Library will
take place this Friday evening
remarked Thorne. All students are
invited to attend the function
which will run from 8-10 p.m.

In conclusion Thorne noted the
three main highlights of this
academic year. This is the
celebration of the 125th
anniversary of the institution, the
podium is to be dedicated in the
Spring, and this year
commemorates the 20th year of
President Collin’s service to the

University.

LAAC Open Hous
Impetus To Student Action

LAAC’s open house policy
became a center of attention this
week as groups of students
formed into one at simultaneous
meetings last night in the uptown
and downtown residence balls.

The meetings were set up and
advertised mainly by a group of
students representing a cross
section of SUNYA. The founders
of the group are Joel Zimmer.
Charles Carroll, and Mike
Gilbertson of Alumni Quad. The
student's goals are: closed doors
during open houses, elimination
of women's sign-outs and hours,

and eventually 24
visitations.
Presently, all proposals are in
bill form under LAAC
consideration. The students have
organized themselves in order to
attend tommorrow's meeting en
masse, hoping that a large
turn-out will insure pnssugc ol'a at
least two of the proposals: closed
doors and thc cnd of women's
sigirouts, these being the least
controversial demands.

Campus Political Groups Evaluate

Effectiveness In 6 Campaign

by Daryl Lynne Wager

With the results of the recent
national, state and local elections
tabulated, both successful and
unsuccessful candidates are
studying the figures as they
evaluate the effectiveness of their
campaign strategies.

Similarly, the various political
groups on campus are looking
back at their efforts this fall in an
attempt to measure the value if
their activities on behalf of the
candidates.

Twenty State students, under
the guidance of Ken Stokem,
boosted the campaign of Richard
Nixon by working in the Albany
area. These Nixon workers, about
half of whom were drawn from
the membership of the Young
Republicans, handed out
literature at' shopping centers,
posted information on telephone
poles, made information available
to voters by telephone and
assisted in driving voters to the

polls.

The highlight of their work was
working on the Nixon Bus
Bandwagon during the last two
weekends of the campaign.
Although Vicc~Prcsidcnt-clcct
Spiro Agnew was not favored by
all the Nixon workers, enthusiasm
for the entire Republican ticket
grew throughout the campaign,

Newspaper advertisemean drew
about fifty responses for M. J.
ll'781".i)l.‘lg, who coordinated the
campaign for llubcrt Humphrey
on campus. However, the great
majority of callers were merely
expressing lhcir support of the
candidate; only a handful of
student-s were willing to work.
Rosenberg explained the luck of
student support for Humphrey to
be “the phony idealism of those
who had pledged themselves to
McCarthy.”

Despite their lack of numbers,
Rosenberg and Co-chuirman
Lenny Kopp (who themselves had

formerly supported the candidacy
of Robert Kennedy) did speak to

students about supporting
Humphrey. Looking ahead to
starting a ‘ Paul O'Dwyer for

Mayor" movement, Rosenberg is
working to establish a Young
Democrats organization In the
senatorial race, .lacob Javits was
supported by a branch of the
Young Republicans under its
vice-president, Dave Mott. Mott
was drafted by adult supporters of
Juvits to involve students in the
campaign.

The climax of the campaign for
student supporters of Javits was
the candidate's visit to the
campus. The committee of four
who maintained the Juvits table in
the Campus Center confined their
activities to the campus because
they felt their candidate would
surely win.

Tom O'Connor, Carol
Schneider, and Ira Wolfman,
coordinators of the O'Dwyer

68’

movement, began late in
September to arrange for student
support of Paul O'Dwyer’s
senatorial candidacy. State
students for O'Dwyer, a
canvassing organization, spent
Saturdays and Sundays
distributing literature
door-to-door in the Albany area.

The October 18 rally with Tom
Paxton, Myrna Loy and the
Wilkies attracted 1600 students.
Fifty students who were O’Dwyer
workers breakfasted with the
candidate on October 19 as a
reward for their efforls on his
behalf.

The fact that O‘Dwyer run well
in Albany County, which swept
into office nearly all of its
Republican candidates, is
consoling to his supporters, who
are considering the formation on_
campus of an independent
Democratic organization of the
McCarthy-Kennedy type.

He will also speak with student

As an author, he has published
several books dealing with
