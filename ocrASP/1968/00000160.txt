1972 campaign began.

New York outfit called
Hope (Help Organize People
Early) mailed out, for arrival
on or shortly before election
day, green and white buttons
bearing this inscription, “EMK
1972." These are the initials of
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy D-
Mass.

With the botton came a small
card saying, “This is a very
special button. it was made to
be worn on the morning of
November sixth. It will serve as
our sign of hope on that
morning and for the next four
years."

This should give President-

Mid-East Tensions

Viewed By Zenner

“Many of the divisions in the
Middle East are results of
agreements made during
which ended exactly ﬁfty years
ago today," stated Dr. Zenner of
the Anthropology Department of
the University. This, the first of
three lectures on the Middle East,
was sponsored by the Forum of
Politics November 11, at 3:30
p.m.

Discussing some of the social
factors resulting in the tensionjn
the Middle East, Zenner
mentioned the Balfour
Declaration. "In this document,
the English promised the Jewish
people the right to establish a
republic. The present state of
Israel is connected to the
fulﬁllment of this statement.“ He
added that the day of the signing
of this document is ‘ an Arab day
of mourning."

Commenting on the
culture, Zenner cited “the
dominant religion Islam, the
Arabic language, patrolineal
family structure, and nomadism"
as the main similarities between

t e various b nations. ‘ Despite
this unity, t e dream of a united
Arab world has never been

' realized.

This is in part due to the large
number of Non-Arab minorities in
these countries, such as the Copts
in Egypt, and the Maronites and
the Greek Orthodox in Lebanon.’

‘In Israel, a supposed melting
pot, a division is also evident
between the Jews of Eastern
Europe and Russia, the
‘old-timers,’ and those Jews from
the Middle East. Although Israel
has undergone much
westernization, there is a desire on
the part of the Eastern European
minority to retain old traditions

The Jews and the Arabs exhibit

groups have a certain loyalty to

battle is the last battle and a ﬁght

other hand, have a :Suiau'iri

“The Arab nations and Israeli
nations want peace- and
sovereignty, but there are forces
within both nations that would be
dissatisfied with a negotiated
settlement. The WIII’,
unfortunately, is a unifying force
for the Arabs and Jews,"
concluded Dr. Zenner.

For Funds Begins

Campus Chest, the annual fund
raising drive at the University, will
solicit money through various
methods and then will donate it
to area charities.

The co-chairmen this year,
Linda Berdan and Debbie Byron
have decided so far on two
charities to receive the donations
raised by Campus Chest. One is

the project started with the
money raised by the Mental

ago,another is a tutorial program

Knowledge Is Not Enough
Says ‘Education Plus’Speaher

by Gale MeAIIistsr

Charles M. Carr of the Christian
Science Organization gave a
lecture entitledv‘"U " Plus"
on Monday night.

Carr discussed the Idea of a
value system. He believes the
university of today does not give
its students real values although it
does give them a good education.

“Knowledge is not enough," we
need real values, says Carr. He said
that we need a purpose in life that
is more meaningful than
materialistic goals.

Carr said that people can get
this purpose by believing in an
ultimate truth and that people can
put their talents to better use
simply by understanding what life
is all about.

The first area discussed was
academic life. Carr stated that if
the student would depend more
upon spiritual thought instead of
merely intellect, he would
accomplish more.

Secondly, he discussed how
people can improve human
relations by looking for man’s

Mandatory Tax Policy
Before Supreme Court

by Barry chhner

Students at SUNYA will have
an opportunity to hear the
recently adopted mandatory
student tax discussed at full
length in the Campus Center
Ballroom Sunday, Nobembcr 24
at 2:00 p.m. At this time the pros
and cons of the recent bill,
making student tax mandatory
will be discussed before the
Supreme Court.

No separate referrals against
the recent referendum have
accepted by Supreme Court. The
group organized by Paul Schlecht
and Steve Kichen which circulated
petitions will try to work in
conjunction with Keith Ncaiy. ii
member of Central (‘ouncil wii'i
ﬁled a separate suit against Ilir'
validity of the referendum

Supreme Court met Friday
November it and decided that the
two referrals would be accepted.
They also arranged for a hearing
where responsible advocates of
both sides of the ISSUL‘ would be
able to voice their views in front
of SUNYA students.

The

petitions, which were
circulated at dinner lines, were
signed by over 2200 students

which is for more than the total
number of students who voted on
the resolution. When told of this

fact, Keith Nealy expressed
disappointment that those who
signed these petitions did not go
to the polls during the
referendums.

The argument over whether or
not there should be a mandatory
student tax, will not be in the
forefront of the debate since the
topic is whether the recent
referendum run by the student
association is valid or not.

Supreme Court will make
its decision on the referendum
within one week of the hearing
date. It is possible that Supreme
Court will allow questioning by
the audience, a procedure which is
most unusual. at the hearing.

The lormat of the hearing will
have the group challenging thc tax

students can see their money at
work.

Campus Chest week starts
November 18 and ends November
24. Since total involvement of the
campus is desired different events

the University Monday night of

Aside from usual money-raising
techniques, such as selling

boosters the Trivia contest, and
ﬂuctiom, the big money raiser this
year is the First Annual Campus

feel that this promises to be one
of the most exciting events this

year.
