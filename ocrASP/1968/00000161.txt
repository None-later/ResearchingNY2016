Tax Shaft

To the Editor:

Who among us is happy in these
times? We have all had more crap
crammed down our gullets than
our innocent minds could ever
have forcasted. But at least most

of it has been from
without—among ourselves as
students we’ve all been fairly

decent to one another.
Unconditional free speech has
existed among us, at least
unfettered by factions from
within. SDS, supporters of ‘The
Hump,‘ friends of ‘Big Red Fred,‘

‘Tricky Dick's' kids, and the
GREYHOUND capitalist have
shared peacefully a common
ground.

And to my eyes, self-regulated.
But we students are un~governed
from within. We haven‘t had
much need for student
government, it has seemed, and
those few whose interest it was
were of little matter. Until we got
shafted.

Mandatory student tax. Not
determined by us; only for us.
That farce the Student
Association calls now a
referendum was quite obviously
not that in the eyes of most of us.
Less than one-fourth voted in
three days. Not due to
apathy—the action simply hasn’t
been in student government, and
henca, the outcome is of little
value to many of us.

Something important like a tax
referendum simply shouldn't be
held with student government
elections. And when it is held, it
should be clearly presean as a

True Spirit?

To the Editor:

1 feel 1 must respond to Mr.
Soja’s and Miss Battaglino's article
answering “Why rush?". The basis
of their rationale lies in the
supposition that “true spirit" can
be found only in a Greek
organization. They present this
conclusion by citing what, they

must feel, is a typical
manifestation of Greek
involvement-the Homecoming

Parade. it is unfortunate that they
take such a limited view of Greek
life because they have proven
nothing to me about the
advantages in rushing. indeed, by
their exclusions l began to feel
Greeks have nothing at all to offer

that can't be found in
independent life.
Greeks alone have “true

spirit"? One can cite an equal
number of examples of spirit in
the independent realm. Last year
at Holiday Sing, Alden llall
dominated the program with their
spirit and enthusiasm and wound
up winning the trophy. in fact, of
the top five groups, three were
independent dorms, the other two
being Brubacher and Bieecker. At
State Fair ‘68, five trophies were

 

   

 

eliminate these problems.

The ﬁrst plan would provide for the most
efficient service. This plan would involve hiring
one full-time employee per quadrangle and

modifying present facilities.

Currently each hall contains mail boxes for its
residents. Under this proposed system, all mail
boxes would be relocated to a central location on

the quad.

The present recreation room on the mezzenine
level of each of the three towers could serve as this
central mail room. The rooms are not currently
used as recreation rooms. Furthermore, the room
is of sufﬁcient size to serve this purpose and

conveniently located on the quad.

Mail could be delivered to the quad mail room

awarded for qualities such as
originality, publicity, and best
decoration. Of the five, four were
given to independent groups. On
Dutch Quad last year, 11 Banner
contest was sponsored with Van
Cortlandt winning. Unfortunately
only three Greek groups out of
nine participated.

if it is not the winning, but
participation, that is important, a
final example of independent
group spirit can be found in the
Bleecker Hall volleyball team.
What other team brings its own
cheerleaders and cheering section
to every game?

1 hope 1 have shown that the
spirit can and is found in
independent life, But what makes
it more meaningful to me is that it
is the “true spirit” for “true”
means completely spontaneous
and completely undemanded.

Special deliveries and packages could also be
picked up any time during the 8-4230 work day.

The record turnout of voters on

Tuesday demonstrates that
Americans maintain an abiding
faith in the democratic process.
The New Left and George Wallace
stand corrected; only a small
minority of Americans reject the
two party system.

And the "irregular" vote came
this year not from any
revolutionary proletariat, but
from the hard core racist. It went
to the Wallace party. The Socialist
Workers and the assorted
“peace-freedom” parties made
nary a dent in the electoral bloc.

The black vote went, as it
should have to Vice President
Humphrey. Black people voted in
record numbers and it was their
vote that enabled Humphrey to
carry virtually every major
American city. Without the black
vote the Democrats would have
been annihilated.

The election demonstrated the
irrelevancy of the campus Marxist.
America is not revolutionary; the
“proletariat” is reactionary if
anything. No student-worker
alliance threatens the system here.
The two nations that constitute
America will co-exist until some
leader arises who can effect a
reconciliation.

The two nations are divided not
solely by race. The first isNixon's
America. It is rural and small
town, middle class and middle
ages. Its personification is the
Middle West. The second nation
was Robert Kennedy’s and then
Hubert Humphrey’s. It is black or
minority white; it is young, and a
good part of it is poor. It is urban
and it thwarts a John Lindsay or a
Jerome Cavanaugh.

Nixon won few votes from this
America. He lost New York,
Pennsylvania, and Michigan.
Murray Kempton says that‘ there
seems to be no city larger than
Peoria from which Nixon was not
beaten back;he is the President of
every place in this country which
does not have a bookstore."

A n d y e t t h e
Kennedy-Humphrey American is
not revolutionary. He will survive
four years of President Nixon.
And in 1972 he will horrify the
leftists as he works within the
Democratic party to nominate
and elect a Kennedy, a McGovern,
or a Humphrey, His victory is
inevitable.

For the time being, we have Mr.

Nixon. l dreaded his victory
statement as much as 1 dreaded
another concession from that

much defeated candidate. 1 had
hoped that he would lose and just
go away. 1 did not want to witness
his final humiliation.

When his moment of victory
came, I forgive him every
exuberance (except that grotesque
hands-overhead gesture) and even
forgot, for a few minutes, how
much 1 dislike this man. 1 could
only marvel at his amazing
capacity for survival and sadly
contemplate four years of Pat’s

smile, Julio‘s David and Dick‘s
acting conch.
But as 1 watched the

President-Elect, 1 was suddenly
struCk with the idea that just
possibly this was the real Nixon.
He actually seems to believe all
those Fourth of July pieties he
expresses. In his acceptance
speech at the Convention, he
waxed most eloquent about
young boys with Quaker mothers
who become Presidents,

l became quite certain that
Dick Nixon believes that his story
carries echoes of lloratio Alger,
And why not? He did, like it or
not, go from grocery clerk to
President. Who am 1 to say that
Richard Nixon, lack of idealism
notwithstanding, does not
personify the American Dream.

With this realization, 1 can

  

accept Nixon. We knew Johnson
was a phoney; on the outside he
was all piety, but on the inside we
knew he was a roaring blood and
guts man. it looks like Nixon is a
pious facade through and through.

Despite his personality we
should wish him well. His destiny
is now ours. And he has problems.
He is unloved and unlike Lyndon
Johnson, he never has received an
electoral majority. He faces a
hostile congress and a hostile
press.

He surely wants to be a good
President. He will probably fail
and yet there is always the chance
that he will amaze us once more.
He has pledged to “bring us
together." He cannot succeed
without our initial tolerance, if
not support.

There will be four years in
which we may criticize Nixon if
he proves himself deserving of
only criticism. As a liberal
democrat, 1 do not expect that
President Nixon will succeed; as
an American 1 pray for his
success.

in any case, 1 think it
imperative that we give him a
chance. Now, we have no other
choice.

 

 

On The Other Hand

by Tom Comm and Doug Geldsehinidt

 

 

 

The referendum on student tax
which has been passed by the
student body is being questioned
by some concerned students who
are misrepresenting the facts.

A valid challenge to any issue
should be based upon thorough
research and not upon hearsay
evidence or arbitrary standards.
The petition offered as a challenge
to the referendum is not a valid
document as it is merely a poor
justification for student apathy
based upon invalid invention of
"proof."

The petition’s first contention
is that “There was a significant
number of students who were
unable to vote due to the delay in
distribution of required activity
cards."

Upon examination of the facts,
however, one finds that those
students lacking validation cards
were told to return to the polls on
Friday if the information Desk
did not have their card. Students
who cared enough to return on
Friday were either sent to the
Bursar's office where they
received temporary validation
cards, or had a small piece of their
l.D. card snipped.

There were only twelve such

students who desired to vote
enough that they went through
this simple procedure. It
regrettable that these students
were required to run through this
red tape, but the fact remains that
any student who wanted to vote
was permitted to.

The second contention states,
that students were not informed
prior to the referendum that the
athletic fee of $8.50 per semester
was included in student tax.

It was not necessary, however,
for the referendum to show a
breakdown of all bf the
organizations which receive funds
from student tax, for any student
who cares enough to determine
where his tax dollars go can easily
do so by reading the booklet sent
by SA. to every student before
the beginning of the fall semester,
or by asking any representative of
Central Council. There is no
excuse for being uninformed
except apathy.

Secondly, the petition fails to
show where the harm in money
being appropriated for the athletic
fee lies. It is very nice for this
group to point out this fact, but
we fail to see its relevance.

The third contention of the

Now Nixonism is The One, and
unfortunately, Agnew is the Other
One. Together they promise to
“reach higher for America.‘ Like
their slogan “Vote Like Your
Whole World Depended On it,"
no one has yet figured out what
the Nixon team is reaching for,
nor why the world is depending
on them.

But in any case, Nixon is now
the One. This must be a good
omen because, according to
Governor Rhodes of Ohio, Nixon
believes ‘in God, the family, the
people, and the system..." That
should certainly give everyone
faith in the next four years as
Nixon faces a hostile Congress, a
divided people, divided races,

divided classes, and a divided
Vietnam.

And if it doesn‘t, all can be sure
that Nixon will think up

something. He is so good at saying
nothing, and promising
everything, that only a fool would
deny that he will be able to take
care of all the nation's ills.

During a recent Madison Square
Garden speech, for example, he
said it was time ‘Lo take off the
gloves and sock it to ‘em," by

added to correct the false picture
given in your presentation.

1, The speaker never mentioned
that “the Middle East was always
Moslem and must remain so,‘ The
speaker said that the Arabs, who
are predominantly Moslems,
believe in all prophets of Judaism
and Christianity and are from the
same scmitic race and could not
he anti-semilic; because they
would be anti themselves and all
what they believe in.

2. The point of the American
lady who spoke during the
question period was that the
Americans who are living here; in
order to appreciate the nature of
the Arab‘lsraeli conflict; should
try to dig for the truth and not
accept what is in most cases a
slanted version of the truth.

As she believes, out of her
experience in the area, the Arab
point of view is not well
represented and expressed in this

. . r v a: 
country because of the

manufacturing a list of no—no's
committed by the demonic
Democrats: war, crime, inﬂation,
etc. From there, he went on to
offer his solutions.

His solutions were so new and
bold, it is amazing that he was
unable to sweep the country. He
utterly shocked the nation by his
fantastic pledge to increase social
security. He promised also: to end
crime by firing the Attorney
General; to create fifteen million
new jobs out of thin air; to repeal
the surcharge as a Democratic plot
to subvert the taxpayer; and he
would even go so far as to unite
the people.

As for youth, “Oh!’ that
“Great Generationl", he promised
to listen and love ‘em. So he will
have "listening centers," where,
apparently, they can listen and
love him.

But maybe he will be loved.
After all, he said that “there is
nothing wrong with America that
a good election won't cure." And
this is something, because after
the problems aren't cured, he can
always say it was a bad election,
what with all those Democrats
remaining in Congress.

    

,, ,
way the
issues are presented in the press
and over the media of
communication. She mentioned
the ‘Christian Science Monitor“
as probably the only American
newspaper that approaches, the
issue in an objective manner.

After reading your review, sir, I
believe she is completely right,

3. The spokesman of the
lsraeli point of view made it Clear
that lsrael is following the ‘only
accepted International Law”
which is according to him
“MIGHT IS RlGil’I‘.' They were
not making a plea for peace, but a
plea for the ‘ fait accompli.”

4. The member of the Socialist
Workers Party DID NOT SAY
that his party supports the "Arab
Terrorist Organization,"
Palestinian Resistance Movement
“AL-FATAH.’ All that he said is
that he heard at a rally of a
member of that party who met
with one of the 'AL-FETAH"

 

Absent from his campaign
machinery was a New Frontier or
Great Society type slogan. It
seems fitting that the “Great
Generation" give him one—so
next week a vote will be taken to
pick one of the following slogans:
"Trying Times,‘ 'Revival of the
Righteous,” or “Naughty Nick

petition states “It was not clear to
a significant number of students
that the referendum was other
than an opinion poll." Aside from
the fact that the definition of
referendum means anything but
an opinion poll, three separate;
issues of the ASP (Oct. 15, 18,
and 22) state, "If enacted, the
policy will go into effect next
semester..."

We can only infer from these
facts that any student who
thought the referendum was an
opinion poll either cannot read or
was too apathetic to do so. It is an
affrontery to the members of this
University to use ignorance as an
excuse for being uninformed.

The fourth contention, and
ﬁnal point of the petition states,
“At least a 2/3 vote should be
required to pass the mandatory
student tax since this involved the

restriction of basic student
liberties.”
This contention is totally

ambiguous for it never states
whether it means a 2/3 vote of the
entire student body or 2/3 vote of
those who voted. Further, the
choice of 2/3 seems to be
arbitrary. The authors never state
why the number of students
needed to approve a referendum
should be amended to read “2/3
vote.” Such negligence renders
this contention meaningless.

These students‘ after the fact
objections indicate only their lack
of understanding of democratic
principles in that they are
attempting to justify their
pre-election apathy by presenting
us with a dubious, post—election
fantasy.

The students who have
conjured up this petition may
have the best of intentions, but
their lack of investigation has
rendered their petition
meaningless.

 

This column is not humorous,
it is not intended to be humorous.
In order for it to be printed under
the ASP policy, it cannot offend
anyone.

"if McGuerty can be humorous
without dumping on people and
write a column that‘s better than
yours, you don’t have to offend
people either.”

This is how a free campus
publication operates, and for be it
from me to tell the editor how to
run this paper. 1 have felt the
power of censorship for the past
two years, and have not enjoyed

    

leaders saying that there are Jews
ﬁghting along side the Arab

Commandos against lsraeli. He
asked the speaker whether he

knows anything about this
subject.
6 As a matter of fact,

NABLUS is in the West Bank Of
Jordan and not in lsrael as
reported. Even lsrael does not
claim Nablus—so far.

May 1 add sir, that 1 came to
this country with the belief that
news are controlled only in
Totalitarian Fascist states; it never
occured to me that this could
possibly happen here.

1 would therefore appreciate if
this correction would appear in
your next issue in toto, and at the

same place of the summary
presented in November Fifth
issue.

Sincerely yours,Ahmad Sharkas,
President of the Arab Student
Club.

it. This is not to say that every
column was cut for purity's sake,
but many times I found my

definition of "good taste"
differed with the opinions of the
editors.

1 cannot, however, blame the
ASP. Since ASP has become a
genuine newspaper (this
semester—in case you hadn*t
noticed the difference), the editor
has eliminated what 1 would refer
to as the personality of the ASP.
How long the students will put up
with such an aimless paper, which,
by the way has an expenditure
line of approximately $20,000, is
something which remains to be
seen.

As for myself, I have turned my
efforts toward establishing a
humor magazine quarterly,
lentatively entitled ‘Torpedo.’

We have been working to have
this magazine sponsored by
Student Tax through the auspices
of Central Council. The Torpedo
organization is now temporarily
recognized by Communications
Commission and we have a
representative on that
commission. With no further
delays, our first publication
should be out within the first two
weeks in December.

Columns like ‘A Piece of the
Sheet' no longer have a place in
the ASP. Those who are interested
in writing free-style humor and
satire, 1 would urge you to
contact me, and to those who
enjoy reading it, 1 would urge you
to look for ‘Torpedo' in early
December. 11. will cost a quarter,
but remember that the ASP is
free. You get what you pay for.
