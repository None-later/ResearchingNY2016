ALC League II Champs
End Season With 9-6 Win

Having gone virtually unnoticed this sports season, the League 11 stalwarts, Alpha Lambda Chi, have
amassad a record unmatched by any other AMIA team this year at State. Their most recent triumph came

in the ﬁnal game of thier season as they preserved an undefeated record, defeating APA, 9-6.

Previously unscored upon, it
took a rare ﬁeld goal to pull out
the victory for ALC who had
amassed 101 points before this
contest.

The first score of the game
came on the second set of
offensive downs for ALC
following the first of several
interceptions by defensive back
Wayne Fetter. Quarterback Jerry
Calvario immediately moved the
champions to the APA eight yard
line where he hit Dennis
Dominick for the score. The extra
point kick was missed making the
score, 6-0.

As the first quarter ended ALC
again began to move toward teh
APA goal only to be stopped near
the twenty-five yard line. To the
surprise and elation of the fans,
John Birchler converted a
thirty-five yard field gaol. That
left the score at ALC, 9 and APA,
0.

Late in the second quarter,
APA mounted their only
sustained drive and scored as the
half ended. The second half
proved fruitless for both sides as
interceptions stymied several
concerted efforts to score by both
teams.

In winning the League II title,
ALC defeated the Raiders,
Waterbury, the Hoots, TXO, APA
and State Quad. The latter team
had the dubious honor of losing
by the largest margin of any
AMIA team in any league this
season,‘43-0 to ALC.

The outstanding performers for
the league II titlists were
quarterback Jerry Calvario and
defensive stalwart Wayne Fetter.
Calvario, a senior, threw for
ﬁfteen touchdown passes.

APA , LEAGUE l CHAMPIONS,scored I42 poin
18. Both marks were the best in the league.

On Friday, November 15, from
7:30 to 10:00 p.m.,
approximately twelve University
women will be attending a clinic
for formal instruction in the rules
and methods of officiating
volleyball, to be held in Ravina,
New York.

Each student will then take a
written and a practical exam
which if passed will give them
local ratings in volleyball. They
may then officiate local games for
an established salary which runs at
a minimum of $4 per game.

In mid-December. another
clinic of the same type for
basketball will be held in
Wappinger's Falls ill which Limc
the volleyball prriclicals will be

given.
Volleyball lntramurals last

unsuccessful. Tuesday, 1 out of -:
games were played, and on
Thursday. .‘i out of 6. However.
the games that were played
provad quite exciting. On
Tuesday, Eastman (20-21) and

The outcome proved that they
did.

kickoff, but failed to move the
ball. APA took over and on their
first play scored on a sideline pass
from quarterback Gary Torino to
flanker Lance Brofsky.

Tappan received the ensucing
kickoff but again could not hold
onto the ball as Torino
intercepted for APA. After
completing a look-in pass to Jack
Sinnott and running for a first
down, he hit Brol‘sky in the end
zone on the identical play that
produced the first touchdown.
This brought the score to 12-0 at
the end of the first quarter.

The second and third periods
produced no scoring as neither
team could mount a sustained
drive, the ball changing hands
numerous times. ’I‘appan, playing
with a new quarterback, Ted

Murrow, was unable to coordinate
a strong offensive threat.

In the fourth quarter, after
Sinnott had intercepted a Murrow
pass, APA scored again. Tight end
Denny 'Elkin snared a Torino
aerial after the ball popped out of
defender Royce Van Evra's hands.
This made the score 19-0 and it
remained that way until the next
to last play of the game when
John Carley kicked a twenty-five
yard field goal to make the final
score 22-0.

Thus, APA ended its season
with a perfect 7-0 record and left
no doubt as to its League I
superiority.

In other games Saturday, KB
and STB finished their seasons
playing to a scoreless tie, as did
Potter Club and Waterbury with
an identical scoreless tic.

CURFEW, OPEN HOUSE BILLS PASSED

by Don Stank-vane

In a special session last night, Central Council accepted LAAC's Proposed Changes
in University Residence Policies by a vote of 24-0-2. The passage of this bill called for
abolition of Curfew Hours, discontinuance of the Mandatory Sign-Out procedure,
determination of Open House policy by the individual Hall or Hall governments, and

Closed Doors.

At this time, freshmen women still have curfew hoursmcxt semester they will face,

if this policy does not become effective, curfews at midnight.

Even though the Mandatory Sign-Out Policy would be abolished, an optional system

could be subscribed to-by any woman.

Determination of Open House Policy by the individual Hall would allow for a 24

hour open house policy, but Visitation Policy could enclose any lesser time span.

The passage of this bill through both Central Council and LAAC is the culmination
of the efforts of Central Council and LAAC memberJay Silvennan, and LAAC’s hard
working Committee on Residence Reforms. Their rationale for these proposed

Reéidence changes, which appears as a special ASP supplement, draws upon several

sources and most

signiﬁcantly from the University publication “Student Guidelines."

Other sources include the Central Council sanctioned LAAC Policy on

curfew.

Gen. Romulo Discusses Asia ,
Clarifies Misconceptions

by Kathy Huseman

"Asia in the American Mind"
was the topic discussed by
General Carlos P. Romulo on
Thursday, November 14. Romulo,
a scholar-in-residence about the
University System, which he
describes as a “traveling salesman
in orbi "J stressed the need to
clarify the American image of
Asians.

According to Romulo, Asia has
just come to the consciousness of
the American mind within the last
decade. Prior to this, the
European continent, and Great
llritian in particular, dominated
the American mind. Even during
World War II, the importance of
the war in the Pacific was not
realized. In an attempt to correct
this, Romulo was sent on a
speaking tour of the United States
covering 466 cities to “bring
home the Pacific war in America."

After the second World War,
with the emergence of China as a
Communist nation rapidly
advancing in scientific knowledge,
the United States was shocked
into the realization that the Asian
culture existed and that people
were suffering from denial in the
affluent 20th Century.

The former President of the
United Nations General Assembly
said that Asia is not a totally
understood entity, but that it
must be understood by the United
States so that she can formulate
foreign policy. lioniulo feels that
the statehood of Hawaii and
Alaska, besides the United States
involvement in Korea and the
United Nations, shown the
American determination to
remain a Pacific power.

liomulo said, "Asia means
people." llc emphasized the fact
that various groups such as
educators look at Asia in terms of
iicliooln rather than people. The
oust-won't cultural exchanges, liu
fools, in an “exchange initwuen
firemen and visiting l'ircinun,
'l‘liuy iiuvur truly got to know the
punpltt who differ from
themselves.

lliii addition to this definition
was "Asia is limo." 'l‘inu- lining
defined as u niovmnuni an wall an a
process with builtin rlunay,
resulting in age.

Some of the basic
characteristics of Asia, as
presented by Romulo, are: The
absence of the pressure of time;
the ability of Asians to live in
various centuries simultaneously
and a relatively unstructured life.
Asians recognize “the authority of
change" but are not fatalistic.
They do not fear death, further
stated Romulo, but view it as an
event which has “its place and
season."

The Asian concept of the

 

 

INFORMATIVE

 

AND ENJOYABLE, General Carlos Romulo

future is also different from the
American. For the Asian "the
future arrives in due course as all
things do."

Americans must also recognize
that American ideas may not
represent what Asians love,
challenged Romuio.

He asked for an emphasis on
the people of Asia rather than the
population so that Asia may be
recognized by America and the
other nations as a real part of the
world.

Responsibility, and MYSKANIA's recommendation for abolition of freshmen women’s

On Wednesday of this week, 250 students assembled in Lecture Room 3 to view the

weekly meeting of LAAC where this bill passed 25-0-1. At this same
LAAC meeting, the “Walden Experiment,” a two week proposal by
Waterbury and Alden to operate Open House by the deﬁnition “A door
is open ifit is not locked" was defeated.

The main reason voiced at the LAAC meeting for the Walden defeat

was the underlying fear that its passage might in some way inhibit
action in the faculty and administratch circles on its “Proposed
changes" listed above.

The current proposed policy changes were felt to be more
comprehensive and far more extensive than the “Walden Experiment."
A majority of LAAC representatives felt that the administration would
slow action on the more important “Proposed Cluingcs" or, perhaps
even limit future changes to only the changes proposed in “Walden
Experiment."

The basis for these residence reforms is cacn student’s personal
responsibility. Personal responsibility will be the key to a sufﬁcient
security system and personal responsibility will be the key to student
conduct behind a closed door so that one student does not infringe
upon the rights ofany other.

Student government leaders are hoping that the ASP Supplement will
inform students not only of the new frccdoms that a reformed
residence policy can allow, but also the responsibility that it will

demand of them personally.

Biafran Grad Student
Speaks Out On War

by Honda Small

‘Blafra will never give up until
everyone is killed; we would not
have gotten into this war had
there been another alternative.’
asserted 0.8. Okon, n Biafran
graduate student at the
University. He went on to say that
Biafra will never become part of
Nigeria because that would mean
death at the hands of the
Northern Nigerians.

The background of the present
crisis in Nigeria was discussed in
depth lit the meeting of the
Student Faculty Committee to
Keep Biafra Alive November 12.
Okun held that before
independence, Nigeria was
superficially kept together under
the barrels of British guns.

The library is a depository

documents from state, local

government bodies.

Additionally, this library now In

tied in, on an experimental basis
to ten other libraries in New York
State, including tho New York
City and New York State libraries,

which it is possiblo fora local uecn

Moslem, uneducated North for
the Christian, capitalistic East was
festering. There had been
massacres of Easterners living in
the North since 1948. Finally,
after numlrous compromises, the
Eastemera saw no other way out
than the creation of an
independent Biafra‘, stated Okori.

Okun Inter asserted that after
World War [1 the world had
pledged that what had happened
in Germany'would not ever occur
again. Yet, ‘now, over four million
people have been killed in Biafrn
and still the world passively
watches, claiming this to be an
internal conflict.

The major nations of the world
are dedicated to preserving the
status quo, Okun said, as is shown
when 'the New York Times
reports things that are polarized
180 degrees from the truth.’

When risked nboiit what
students can do to help the
situation, the Biafran students
replied that it is imperative to put
political pressure on whomever
they can. They were leery of
contributing to any United
Nations organizations or to the
Red Cross, as those groups may
iild Nigerian foderulists.

In the near future, the Student
Faculty Committee to Keep
lliafra Alive is going to set up a
table in the Campus Center, A

Service will send to lliafra the
money that would have been used

in December. Additionally, cola
lcctions will be made at Colonic
Shopping Center on weekends.
