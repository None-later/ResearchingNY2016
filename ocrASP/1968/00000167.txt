wrestling season on December 7.

The Albany State sailing Club is
having a special meeting on
November 19 at 7:30 pm. in
Physics 129. This meeting was
called because the club was given
the opportunity to have as a guest
Bayard Fenner, sailing coach at
Adelphi and Bay Constable, to
give a discussion on sailing.

In 1965, Mr. Fenner reached
the Mallory Cup district
elimination finals. He also won
two races from Cornelius Shields,
Jr., who later became North
American sailing champion.

Mr. Fenner’s services are
requested in regattas and national
sailing championships for course
patrol because of his extensive
knowledge of water and wind
conditions.

Due to the sailing teams
outstanding season of four team
wins out of five fall regattas, there
Is a possibility that some more
boats can be bought. The club is

particularly interested in boats
which would make a Henry
Hudson Regatta, a race from New
York to Albany, possible.

Anyone who is interested is
welcome to attend this meeting

Post following a five year lapse.
Montclair, Coast Guard, and
Brooklyn Poly have been dropped
from the slate.

Last winter, the Great Danes
suffered through a 1-10 campaign
worst in the school’s 13 year
wrestling history. Their only
victory came against Brooklyn
Poly.

Water-Safety Classes
Set For Applicants

The SUNY aquatic staff will be
offering a Water Safety Instructor
Retraining Program beginning
December 4, 1968. This program
is in compliance with the new
national Red Cross policy for
recertifying water safety
instructors. All holders of an
instructorship must take such a
program and satisfactorily
complete it to be properly
recertified.

The program will be conducted

All-Stars Angered By

Action

In a recent interview with
Irish-AIl-Star mentor Bill Blain,
certain discriminatory practices of
AMIA that have barred the
All-Stars from competition were
discussed.

Captain Blain described a
“covert, insidious, heinious plot
on the part of AMIA League I
Bowling and its officials," as the
corner stone that kept the
All-Stars off the League I roster.

In summing up the bad turn
done by AMIA to his All-Stars,
Captain Blain also mentioned that
other AMIA League 1 teams have
not always been above board in
their signing of new players.

Also discussed was the bud
showing of other teams as they
floundered on the stubborn
All-Star defense, thus deflating
what were once high averages.
Bluin also mentioned other team‘s
jealousy for the amount of
publicity recorded by the
All-Stars.

This was thought to be not
simply due to the excellent
publicity stuff of the All-Stars,
but rather to dynamicism of the
All-Stars themselves.

The All-Star roster also notices
some changes this year. While still
retaining such stellar performers
as very offensive captain Butch
McGuerty, the defensive stalwart
"Fuzzy" Galvin, sparkplug Jim
Healy, ‘Bullet" Dan Moran (last

of course captain, Bill Blain.

Missing from this year‘s squad
will be key offensive player Mike
Brennan, who has not recovered
from a roughing up by League I
toughs, and Mick “the Thing“
McMsaahon, who was dropped
from the squad due to excessive
weight.

New faces will be number one
draft choice, Chip Johnson and
Tom Howard, who was obtained
on waivers from Grambling
College.

While being relegated to League
11, Captain Blaln will reorganize
hls volatile defense and introduce
a new, virulent offense. “It's the
audacious, pugnacious,
pusillanimous gume we've played
that has given us our fine
reputation,” states Captain Blain,
“and we don‘t intend to let down
one bit."

The intercollegiated swim and
basketball teams have been
diligently preparing for their
competitive seasons for the past
several weeks. The swim team has
been working out every weekday,
swimming to build the endurance

through a ten-meet season. The
first competition they will be
participating in, though not part
of their season will be the Albany

varsity soccer team opened and
closed well, but a month-long
slump in between saddled the
boaters with a 3-6-1 record for
the 1968 season.

The Great Danes won their
opening game and two of their
final three contests, but went
0-5-1 from mid-September to
mid-October, during ' which time
they were outscored 31-8.

Coach Bill Schieffelin, in his
first year as varsity mentor has a
relatively young team and the
returnees augur well for 1969.
The two leading scorers will be
back, junior Jim Shear (eight
goals) and sophomore Ron Spratt
(six goals); as will junior Ed
Campbell who contributed 10
assists.

In fact, of the 19 goals and
sixteen assists recorded by the
Danes, only three goals and two
assists were by seniors.

The major losses will be

fullback and Harold Toretzky,
halfback; fullback John Compeau

greatly support from the student

performed well and added much
needed experience to the squad.

Last year, Albany’s problems
resulted from a weak offense
which scored a record low 10
goals in a 3-7 season. This fall, the
Dana‘s woes can be traced to a
defense which permitted a record

The 1968 offense tallied 19

years.

“OUR IDEALS

SHOULD BE
OUR OWN!”

Our University is committed to recognizing
maturity. It is assumed that students will formulate
their own ideals and standards." It also felt that the
University “should not attempt to direct the
formulation of these standards and ideals.” “Our ideals
should be our own."

Should not university residents be allowed to
determine their own limitations? Should theynot take
responsibility for their own actions? What are the
responsibilities of university life which demand a listing
of hours which do not educate, but, as stated in the
1967 hours proposal,rcstrict university women until
they become acquaintcd with these responsibilities?
Ilow do they become acquainted with responsibility
when they are sheltered from, not cduculcd toward. its
assumption?

The Univcrsily and administration refuse to assume
ihc pnrcrnul rolc. Why should students presume lo
lcgislulc as purcnts for other Students? (011ch years are
not a preparation for life that demands parental
guidance. Thcy are years of living and learning. and
every onc has the right to live and learn without
mcuninglcss restrictions upon this freedom of the
individual.

The rcsponsibililics of university life accepted in the
Rationale for Women's Hours (1967) entail deciding
curriculum and outside activities. Many students have
gone beyond this and have assumed ﬁnancial
responsibility for their cducation. How are these
responsibilities affected by established regulations?
They are not. Obedience to a meaningless rulc
conditions nothing more than obcdicncc to a rule. The
present rcsidencc regulations are not a challengc; they
do not slimululc individual growth, thought and action.
Iiducznion is a lifetime process which is a vital part of
all human development. How can a University educate
when the students place rcstriclions upon education?

Responsibility Is a capacity for confronting
silualions - a capacity which grows with a life time of
thouqu and experience. Experience is the environment
in which lhought is stimulated; the background against
which it is applied and modified. Without it, thinking
slngrnncs and a complctc education cannot cxisl.

'I'hc cutirc university connnunily is entitled to the
assumption of responsibility beyond the academic. and
the opporluuily lo receive an education in living. which
comes by living.

academic community. They should direct their
attention to those acts which cannot be tolerated
because they seriously interfere with the basic
purposes, necessities, and processes of the academic
community. By formulating a code ofethics, rules and
regulations, the University does not absolve each
student from accepting responsibility for his own
behavior. Rather, it reafﬁrms the principle of student
freedom coupled with an acceptance of full
responsibility for individual action and the
consequences of such action." (p. 25)

“The student is not only a member of the academic
community; he is, additionally, a member ofthc larger
society and thus retains the rights, protections,

MYSKANIA Position Statement

MYSKANIA takes the position that the curfew
system imposed on freshmen women has no rational
basis and ought to be abolished.

The present curfew system implies that freshmen
women should be treated differently from freshmen
mcn. Why does the University make this distinction? 15
ll bccnusc young men are more mature than young
women? This is clearly false - so the argument on
maturity is not acceptable.

llowcvcr, rcgurdlcss of thc rcuson for the distinction,
the result is the same - men are treated preferentially.
MYSKANIA holds this to bc a violation (quite possibly
a legal violation) of the basic rights of women.

Secondly, lllc prcscnl curfcw syslcm implies that
frcsluncn womcn should be treated differently from
uppercluss womcn. Why is lhis distinction made? 15 it
because uppcrcluss women have become acclimated to
the rcsponsibililics of University lifc and are now ready
for no curfcws? This is the argument most often made
by those opposed to a no curfew system for freshmen
womcn. Is this argument vulid'.’ MYSKANIA contends
that it 15 of. We feel that there is o necessary or even
logical connection between a woman coming in at 3:00
am. and her becoming acclimated to the
responsibilities of the University. We hold the argument
to be an abstraction with little or no correspondence to
reality.

Further, if it indeed is the hope that freshmen
womcn will become acclimated to the University -
MYSKANIA asks, how can this posdbly be
accomplished by keeping the freshmen women
separated from the very responsibility we expect them

developing standards of conduct related to the living \to acquire. The present curfew system therefore is

already accepted.

This system should be abolished.
