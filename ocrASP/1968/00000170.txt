Confusions
To the Editor:

I should like to clear up a few
confusions left by the article
covering the meeting to support
Mexican and Latin American
revolutionary students Thursday,
Oct. 31 (ASP, Fri. Nov. 1).

First, the meeting was
sponsored by the Young Socialist
Alliance; it was not a meeting of
the YSA. We meet Sundays at
7:30 p.m, and not all of those
who come then are YSAers or
intend to join. Second, the article
impled that the SUNYA students
who spoke were both YSAers.
Miss Judy Bank not only is not a
YSAer, but to my knowledge she
has no intention of joining. She is
a serious political independent
who supports the Mexican student
movement, and it was solely on
that basis that she agreed to
speak. We respect Miss Bank’s
independence.

Third, the feature speaker. Sr.
Fiorencio Merced, received very
little attention in the article. He is
a leader of FUPI, Federation of
Puerto Rican University Students
for independence, the student
wing of MP! (Movement for
Puerto Rican independence), and
will stand trial Nov. 12, along
with 84 other Puerto Rican
students, for refusing induction
into the US. Army.

Best wishes for greater accuracy
in reporting.

Sincerely,

Carol Anne French
YSA Organizer

GDI’s 'Respond

To the Editor:

This is an Independent Shout in
response to the Greek Echo of
Nov, 8. Who are Mr. Sale and
Miss Battaglino kidding? Their
column tops any propaganda put
out by the Communists in the last
20 years.

What are the Greeks really
doing and what is It they mean?
Homecoming and the Scholarship

Cup do indeed reflect Greek
splri t.
For example, consider float

“spirit”. is it true that Greeks are
fined if they donLt march, with

 

spirit, behind their ﬂoats? Is it
true that Greeks are compelled to
work a minimum number of hours
on their floats, or suffer the
consequences‘,

It was good of Mr. Soja and
Miss Battaglino to acknowledge
the presence of Independent
ﬂoats in the parade. These were
constructed willingly, without
fines or punishment, by many
Independents who can‘t be readily
distinguished as they don’t all
dress, think, and act alike in an
effort to impress each other.

Congratulations to the Greeks
for wining the Scholarship Cup
every year; after all, who else is
eligible?

Greek spirit is truly an awe-full
thing. However. we guess this has
slipped a very sizeable number of
Junior and Senior Greek minds as
many "Spiritied" Greeks have
gone inactive.

The words spirit and Greek 5.
are not synonymous.
Independents also have spirit.
(Who won Holiday Sing lust year?
Are all campus organizations
made up of only Greeks?)

Greek organizations have many
good points, but we Independents
are not a misqubable, sniveling
minority. The backbone of this
campus is made up of unique
independents who think for
themselves and enjoy each other.

Respectl'uly from
God-Damned independents,

Stony Tax

To the Editor:

I recently had occassion to read
a letter in the ASP concerning
“Tax Questions,‘ and I Was
particularly interested in the
comparison of entertainment with
SUNY at Stony Brook. As a
student at Stony Brook, please
allow me to shed a bit of light on

the shrouded myth of our
wonderful position:
First of all, we flew this

entertainment if we want it or

        

not. Each student is required to
pay a $56 activity fee at the
beginning of the year, whether he
is a resident student or a
commuter. From the total sum of
these fees, $100,000 is allotted to
the Student Activities Board
(non-electedll) for the
procurement of entertainers, using
their own taste to hire anybody
they damn please.

It is true that for most of the
concerts no extra money i
charged. But free? Get serious.

Academic Release

 

This University is rapidly evolving into an institution with an
excellent academic reputation. Yet, the plan for the development of the
University is so academically oriented that it has neglected to provide
for a necessary human need-release.

The constant tension and pressure, under which a student is placed
by the demands of his academic load, is a potentially dangerous
element each student must face. The danger lies in the fact that there is
no chance for the student to stop, take time off from the constant
worry of academic pressure, rcconnoitcr his wits and start again.
Without this type of release the student is faced at times with seemingly
unsunnountable problems. The more the student feels he is being
plowed under, the less able he will be to perform his class work, causing
more frustration. Consequently, the student will find himself caught in
an increasing state of tension.

in effect, what is wrong is that as the University is making a
conscious effort to increase its academic standing, it is providing no
element of release to balance the stringent demand of tougher courses.

The University must begin seriously considering providing outlets
through which a student may break away from some of the tensions
and pressures that weigh him down.

Usually the vacation periods are the main facets through which a
student can ﬁnd a release. But, the periods between vacations are
usually long and a student ﬁnds unneeded tension building up during
the weeks ofschool.

Aside from vacations other outlets can be found for the student’s
emotions. One such outlet is the opportunity of a student to let
“himself go" as a spectator at a sports event. if for this reason alone,
the University should more actively pursue the establishment of a
football club.

There has been latent spirit on this campus for football for years;
that spirit only needs a substantive encouragement to become an active
release for the student.

Other ideas (eg. a one day break after the mid-semester period) could
be explored by the University so that the academic life will not crush
the student. We want an academically excellent University, but we also
want to be able to minimize the pressure and tension that that
University will place upon us.

Tuesday, November 19, I968

  

May 13, 1968, the ASP
headline flashes “NIXON SEIZED
IN MEXICO." Nixon, with a
popular mandate, had gone to
Mexico to secure peace. While
driving through downtown
Mexico City in his bombproof
limosine Nixon was surrounded
by adoring youths who tried to
love him to death.

The Mexican government,
fearing that they would be ousted
and replaced by Nixon because of
Nixon’s overwhelming popularity
(in Mexico spitting is a form of
praise), imprisoned him and
demanded that the US admit that
Nixon was sent to incite
revolution.

Vice President Agnew quickly
cabled “Don‘t worry Dick stop if
you've seen one jnil you've seen
them all stop those Spics are all

alike stop signed President
Agnew."

The concerned members of
Central Council immediately

called an emergency session to
remedy the pressing problem of
getting back Nixon. The session
convened on stage in the Theatre
Building and President (Duncan
Doughnut) Nixon called the
meeting to order. Bob Yafmun
opened the session by presenting
his proposal to use the bomb on
Mexico if they didn't give Nixon
back.

He stated “No forty—third rate
country is goin' to push us
around” with his eyes flashing.

“Wait,” screamed Jim Cahn‘t.
“That motion has to go through
Political and Social Positions
Committee first.“ “No, no" said
Linda Bird, “you know as well as
i do Jim, that since lhis is ii
communication, it obviously has
to go through Communications
Commission." But Keith Meely
suggested that since this motion
concerns the conscience of
Central Council and the lives of
the Mexicans (not to mention
President Nixon's life) it should
go through Religious Affairs
Commission.

Loop-along-Vic interjectcd that
since Nixon was living in a jail, the
motion was obviously a matter for
LAAC. Walt Douglierty pointed
out that since Mexico did not
have a line in its budget for
imprisoning Presidents, we could

2..

 

 

simply freeze its budget for
violating finance policy.

Whereupon Jim Cahn’t pointed
out that Finance Policy does
not state that we can freeze
budgets except for specific
reasons outlined in the policy; but
Linda Bird countered that there
was a precedent for this action
since Drama Council has its
budget frozen for spending money
on socket testers in violation of
Line 13 of their budget which did
not include funds for socket
testers.

“Point of information" cried
Jim Losehigh, “what is a socket
tester?" The Doughnut opened
the question to the floor and after
a two hour debate on what a
socket tester was, Central Council
unfroze Drama Council's budget.

Dr. Houser then asked “But
what about President Nixon?" To

Albany Student he.

        

 

which everyone looked perplexed
until a smile of recognition came
over Linda Bird '3 face and she said
"Oh, yes, he's in Mexico."

Duncan immediately stood
up and shouted “No i.’m not, I’m
right here." Jim Cahn’t asked why
Bob Yafman would present a
motion to bring Nixon back from
Mexico if he wasn't there. After a
two hour debate on this issue,
Terry resolved the entire problem
by suggesting that we submit a
referendum to the students of the
University (including those who
haven't paid their tax) and let
them decide whether or not
Duncan Nixon is here.

You, the student, may vote on
whether President Nixon is here
or not by writing yes and no on
your student tax card and mailing
it to box 11043, Stuyvesant
Tower.

THE RED

 

Thank you, Mr. Rosenberg. I
was unable to find an idea for this
column until i read yours. Since
you said that “campus Marxists“
are irrelevant, and, in another
context, mentioned the Socialist
Workers Party, i decided a reply
might be fun.

You view the world as a static
entity, and assume that because it
is, so it always must be. Therefore
you can say that because the
“proletariat” is reactionary now,
therefore it always will be.
Because Fred Halstead and Paul
Boutelle did not do as well as
Wallace nationwide (or Dick
Gregory or Henning Blomen in
New York State) therefore their
candidacy was a waste. You look
only at the events; you do not
consider the multiplicity of
causes.

I do not disagree that workers

What are the pertinent problems
of the new administration? What

the ignorant masses,

Q. What does Mr. Nixon mean
by “black capitalism?"

A. The president-elect recently
cleared up that situation by
stating that his staff has arranged

openings for 300 domestics in
Seiirsdale, N.Y.
Q. Is Nixon really a peace

candidate?

A. Yes. By February, the War
on Poverty will be concluded by a
treaty between Howard Hughes
and Ralph Abernathy.

Q. Can you explain Nixon’s
ambivalent proposal to take direct
action concerning Vietnam before
inauguration Day? A. No.

Q. What are the advantages to
superiority in the arms race, a
stress point (correction: the stress
point) in Nixon's campaign?

A. That‘s a foolish question. it
is apparent to me that if the
United States has a r'ecided

Educators are seen playing the
“reward structure" game, gaining
for themselves huge salaries fiom
grants, contracts from often
peripheral consultantships, and
their own private companies for
their own private grabs.

One of his most remarkable
nnnucintiona is that “university
officials sit on the boards of about
one quarter of the 200 largest
corpornliuns, six of the lil largest
life insurance and utility
companies, five of the largest
iiicrchanilisiiig cuiiipuiiics," etc.

The message that Ridgeway
attempts to tiansmit is therefore
adequately received. But on
i-xniiiiiinlion, the message itself is
n rulherliollow one, for certainly
the University must be more than
juiii a “(linked Corporation."

in fact, whenever the student
revolutionaries (wherever they
may be hiding) decide to adopt
ltidgoway's thesis, they will be
expousiiig all the evils. but none
of the goods, issuing from the
University. To a revolutionary, of
course, that comes firsthand. But
for the rest, some recol'nition of

the good must also be
acknowledged.
For example, it must be

remembered that it is the

    
  

superiority in weapons, we can
completely annihilate the Soviet
Union more times than it can
completely annihilate us.

Q. As the war in Vietnam
gradually comes to a close, we ask
ourselves what were the

advantages of our entanglement
there. Can you answer?

A. Yes. We went to Vietnam in
order to prevent a forceful,
tyrannical, dictatorial takeover by
the communists by compelling the
South Vietnamese to side with us.
The war gave US industry a
much-needed shot in the arm by
opening jobs in defense and other
related fields. Also, by sending
our boys to Asia, we have kept
down the population of our great
land (although we have been
keeping up the population of
South Vietnam).

And, also, if we are lucky,
which we indeed have been, some
of our boys will not return home.
But in order to keep a strong,
moral, intelligent nation, we have
drafted only our dummies. (Let’s
face it; who needs them?) The list
of good sound advancements

.

    
 

 

University product (like Mr.
Ridgeway) which has given us the
shorthand revolutionary slogans
like the "Establishment." it is the
University atmosphere which has
produced the liberal elements in
society from social welfare to the
living theatre.

it is the University which is the
patron of the arts; creator of
philosophic. sociologic, and
psychologic insights; leader of
civil rights, international
understanding, the new politics.“
and so on, ad infiiiitum.

What should he realized then,
before one gets uvurly excited by
Ridgeway's accusations, is that
there are two lists one can draw
up on the role of the Univeisity in
society.

Mr. Ridgeway does a service by
giving us the bad one; but let us
not forget that we can look in
more than one direction.

    
  
  

 

brought about by the war is
virtually endless.

Q. With all this
plurality business, i wonder is
there a sane solution to our
process of electing the president?

A. Certainly. Abolish the
popular vote and let the electors
decide with no outside
interference.

Q. What did George Wallace
consider to be the strong point, i
mean his major qualification, in
his drive for the presidency?

A. Mr. Wallace has been very
active in the ﬁeld of civil rights
enforcement.

Q. if an international field were
in the running for the high posts
on Nixon's staff, who would be
the foreigners, and what would be
their positions?

A. i can only think of one:
Christines Keeler for
vice-president.

Q. How can the United States
prevent itself from losing face in
the Pueblo crisis?

A. By invading North Korea
and forcing the Slow»! members
of the Pueblo to lose their necks.

Did Nixon's “Compromise
with the South" i,e., the choice of
Agnew m; vice-president, pay off?

A. Definitelyultlwas indeed a
compromise. in return for the
important states of North
Carolina, South Carolina, Florida,
and Tennessee, Nixon
relinquished his hold on New
York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and
Maryland.

Q. Did Richard Nixon have Wilt
Chamberlain campaign for him
because he was a Negro?

A. No. Nixon has never been a
Negro. (i can‘t stand these stupid
questions.)

right now are conservative, that a
good share of them are racists.
Nor can one dispute the number:
who voted for Wallace. However,
this simplistic view is not the
whole.

One should also consider that
American workers have the
bloodiest history in the world
labor movement, including battles
with the National Guard in the
Colorado Mine Strikes and the
Pullman Strikes, as well as the
battles of the ‘30’s.

Working men won for
themselves their present position;
it was not a gift from a benevolent
big business. They are still
fighting, from the Chicago bus
strike to the Delano grape strike.

This is the first time this
century that labor has not taken a
i o-strike pledge during a shooting
war, so one cannot say workers
are completely “dead.” And you
didn’t read “Labor,” the
newspaper of the transportation
workers union, after the abortive
railroad strike of June, 1967, so
you don't know how angry
workers can get when they are
doublecrossed, as the railroad
unions were by LBJ.

You see, he lied when he said
that vital shipments would not get
through if the workers struck.
They had submitted a written
agreement to work all vital
shipments of medicine and
material for Vietnam.

The conservatism of working
people now is due to their very
understandable desire to keep
what they have, and to gain more,
if possible. No one likes to see
taxes and inflation eat away at
income.

Workers who voted for Wallace
rather than Halstead did so for at
least 2 good reasons:

i. The anti-Communism
instilled in all of us during the
past 20 years cannot be
immediately overcome.

2. Halstead has little access to
the mass media news coverage
that helped publicize Wallace's

campaign. People didn't know
about him.
They voted for Wallace

primarily out of frustration with
the Democratic and Republican
party, and only secondarily out of
racism. They are frustrated
because no one—Democrat or
Republican—seems able to retard
inflation, or cut taxes, or balance
the budget.

And when working people
realize that they can gain more by
fighting than by not fighting, they
will. They have always used
whatever means were necessary to
make needfui gains. Because they
seem Conservative now does not
mean that they will never
radicalize.
