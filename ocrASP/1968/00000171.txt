THE UNION GAP gave a disappointing performance on

University

Concert

Page Hall will be the scene of
the University Concert Band’s
Annual Fall Concert on November
22. At 8:00 pm Mr. William
Hudson, associate professor of
Music, will begin the myam by
conducting "Chorale" by Vaclav
Nelhybel. This piece is based on a
medieval Bohemian chant
entreating St. Wenceslaus, the ﬁrst
King of Bohemia, to save his
people from the plague. For
centuries it has been sung by the
Bohemians in times of war and
danger. The beginning of the
“Chorale” creates a foreboding
atmosphere which develops into a
humn of hope at the end.
Nelhybel combined modern sound
with Middle Age and early
Renaissance techniques to
produce an ancient theme which
would appeal to modern
audiences.

John Barnes Chance's work,
“Incantation and Dance," is
divided into two sections. The
ﬁrst section, Incantation, is a
quiet mysterious suggestion of a
primative plea. The second section

symbolizes the dance of the
spirits ~
Next on the program is

“Espana Rhapsody," based on
one of Emmanuel Chabrier‘s first
major works, “Espana.” It's
exotic sounds are produced by
vivid harmonic and rhythmic
contrasts.

“The Second Suite for Military
Band in F” by Gustav Holtz
consists of four parts: March,
Song without Words, Song of the
Blacksmith, and Fantasia on the
“Dargason.” The four completely
different atmospheres produced
by these sections provide a very
interesting contrast.

The featured soloist of the
evening will be Irving E. Gilman,
flutist, a graduate of Oberlin
Conservatory of Muisc. He was a
faculty member of the Manhattan
School of Music, the University of
Michigan, and Wayne
University, and performed with
the Detroit Symphony Orchestra
for 12 years before joining the
staff of Albany's Music
Department. He will play “Night
Soliloquy" by Kent Kennan,
accompanied by the band.

Judy Collins, _ Union Gap

Give Mediocre Performance

by Alan Lasker

The Council for Contemporary
Music presented Judy Collins and
Gary Puckett and the Union Gap
in concert on Friday, Nov. 15.

The long awaited evening began
with an unanticipated whimper
instead of the expected hang The
audience-to-be was kept waiting in
the corridors of the gymnasium
for 45 minutes after the predicted
door opening time. I imagine the
people would not have minded
the delay as much as they did, if

someone would have explained to
them the reason for the holdup.
However the explanation never
came, causing impatience and a
degree of disgust.

At this point I feel it necessary
to say that the University
contracted two groups with high
potential, but inefficiently ran the
concert. Judy Collins was forced
to perform with apparatus that
functioned improperly. This not
only annoyed her audience, but
interfered with her performance.
There just was no excuse for this
sort of nonsense! A University
that can organize and produce a
concert should take care of the
all-important details of checking
the equipment before its use.

I am well aware that Judy
Collins has many devoted
followers and that they might
have enjoyed her performance for
the simple reason that it was Judy
Collins performing. However I
think from an impartial

viewpoint, her performance left
something to be desired.

Judy Collins, whose son!8 dealt
mostly with the subject of love,
was greeted warmly by her fans as
she entered the gym. Her opening
number, “Both Sides Now,"
depicted life's illussions that many
of us encounter; the so many
things we would have done if it
weren’t for the "clouds" that
obstructed our way.

In my mind Miss Collins failed
to generate a warm sensation to
her audience. Her devoted fans
might have been pleased with her.
However those individuals, who
had come to hear her perform for
the first time would not have been
impressed with her performance.
It seemed as though none of her
songs were introduced and that
each song followed one another
without cessation.

Miss Collins’ facial expressions
clearly demonstrated her
involvement with what she was
singing. However she proved too
involved in her performing and
seemed to forget she had an
audience. While performing one of
her selections, the microphone
went dead. Knowing this however,

she continued with her lengthy

song even though the vast
majority of her audience could
not hear her. In fact, at the close
of her show, even her avid fans
were disappointed when she did
not return with an encore
selection after they gave her a
standing ovation and many rounds
of applause.

Following the twenty minute
intermission, Gary Puckett and
the Union Gap appeared. They

attempted to appeal to
everyone-the country mustic
enthusiasts heard “Take Your

Pleasure;" the psychedelic music
lovers were entertained with “She
Walks," for the pure rock
admirers “Young Girl," Lady
Willpower" and “Woman,Woman”
were featured; and for the
conservative music listener, “By
the Time I get to Phoenix" and
“The Dreams of the Everyday
Housewife” were included.

One selection that I particularly
enjoyed was their anti-war
selection entitled “My Son.”

Basically the chant was to
re-awaken people to the meaning
and value of a human life.

“The Union Gap” attempted to
ﬂavor their performance with
humor, creativity (as could be
seen in their rendition of
Rosemary's Baby), and variety,
but fell short to be considered as a
number-one group.

On the whole the concert was
only mediocre, when it should
have been good. Neither Miss
Collins nor “The Union Gap",
who are top performers, would
have won over any new fans from
this performance at State.

Albany Student Press

Communications Continued From Page 4-

am playing here this year, but that
event is sponsored by the Junior
Class and tickets (a sure sellout)
will go for five dollars apiece.
Surely the Junior Class, or any
other class, at Albany can work
the same deal at a deﬁnitive
proﬁt.

Beautiful, isn't it? But what
tbout the poor schlemiel who

couldn’t car less about concerts
but winds up paying his fee so
that someone else can see them?

And what about the eight or
nine hundred students who way
down deep inside really groove on
Don Gardner and the Falcons or
Shep Woolly and the Undertakers
but who have no say in the
throwing around of their money?

Or what about the thousands of
dollars spent to obtain six of the
best groups in the country to keep
students on campus during the
three day moratorium?

Most surely our position will
change next year. But meanwhile,
students in Albany should not
forget that the school was built
for them. If you don’t like the

\
way Tax is being handled, open
your mouth and tell somebody
upstairs. Then somebody upstairs
will have to ask the rest of the
students, and if he doesn‘t do it,
you do it.

If you can present a list of a
few thousand names of people
agreeing with you, you can press
for a system like ours if you like



it, or any other feasible system.
80 if you want dank Joplin
instead of Don Gardner, and so do
three thousand other people,
nuke your plea known to people
who count.

Best Wishes,
