On Sports

The winter sports season is about to begin at Albany State. On the
varsity level, it appears as if both the basketball and the wrestling teams
will be suffering. The freshman teams, although it is always difﬁth to
predict how well they will do, again look as if they may be hurt by lack
of participation.

The Great Danes basketball squad has been beset by a number of
misfortunes. Stef Smigiel, who was one of the top substitutes last year,
and was expected to make a valuable contribution to this year’s squad,
is no longer in attendance at this school. Bob Wood, who was sidelined
last year with a virus infection, dropped out of school midway through
this semester. Wood, although there was a question of whether or not
he would be given permission by the doctor to play this year, certainly
would have been an important performer if he had participated. A third
setback suffered by the team was the development of calcium deposits
on Scott Price's ankle. Without Price in the lineup, the team will be
woefully lacking for rebounders.

1 would surmise that while the hoopsters will probably still have a
winning record, it doesn't seem feasible that they will be able to secure
the NCAA bid which they barely missed last year.

The varsity wrestling squad is extremely short of wrestlers this year.
While they have a good set of wrestlers in the lower weight classes,
there is only one man on the squad over 152 pounds. As a result of
such a large shortage of wrestlers, the team will be able to win only If
they capture each of the lower weight‘classes to stand a chance of

winning.

The freshman wrestling squad is suffering from the same lack of
participation. At present, they have only a sprinkling of the projected
wrestlers taking part in the workouts.

The frosh basketball squad does not appear to have the same trouble
as they have more than enough ball players out for the squad. it would
seem that the freshman team may well have an outstanding squad as
they have a multitude of talent to choose from.

it remains to be seen whether or not the wrestlers will be able to
salvage a representative showing and whether or not the basketball
squad will be able to maintain their winning ways despite the loss of
three possible starters.

AMIA also promises some interesting developments as League 1
competition promises to be particularly stiff this year. APA, who won
the Commissioners Cup last year, has their whole team back and in
addition pick up a couple of last year‘s freshman ball players. Potter
Club also looks strong as does KB.

already, controversy has hit the
hardcourts.

The “controversy” centers
around the rosters of two teams
entered in the league. Although
the rosters are not official yet,
both Potter Club and APA have
made it known that they intend
to play former varsity basketball
athletes on their League I entries.

Larry Marcus (Potter) and Tom
Doody (APA) are the students
involved. Each played the
maximum three years of varsity
basketball and are still enrolled
undergraduates at the University.

The rule in question is number
seven under the AMIA rules of
eligibility which states, “Any
undergraduate who has lettered in
a varsity-sport may not also be
competing in intramural AMIA
competition in that sport unless
he is cleared through the
Intramural Ofﬁce and the Athletic
Director."

According to the ruling, Coach
Robert Burlingame, co-ordinator
of intramural athletics, cleared
Doody and Marcus for play.
Immediately, several team
captains registered their protests
of the ruling.

In defending his decision,
Burlingame argued that the rule
was developed, not to protect the

Part Of LAAC Bill Not
To Be Recommended

by Gala McAlliatar

The Faculty-Student
Committee on Residence
discussed the LAAC policy on
residence changes Tuesday and
Thursday.

Sections I and II of the
rationale, concerning Freshmen
Women‘s Hours and the sign-out
procedure, respectively were
recommended to the next
Committee to which the bill will
go, the Student Affairs Council.

However, the remainder of the
bill will not be recommended
until certain terms are specifically
defined.

By having these terms derined
to the point where they cannot be
misinterpreted, the
Faculty-Student Committee feels

they are helping the students to
get the bill passed in the higher
committees.

However, Bruce Cohen, a
member of the Faculty-Student
Committee, feels that “by leaving
no room for ‘misinterpretation,’
the Faculty-Student Committee
denies the rationale of the bill by
leaving no room for the individual
to interpret his own freedoms and
responsibilities.”

Those who originally brought
up the rationale now feel that the
bill is being “blown all out of
proportion," and that the whole
point of the bill is being missed,
which is that the students should
be able to live their own lives
without anybody interpreting

Colum bia’s Strike

Through Mark Rudd’s Eyes

by Patti Ambrogi

“Up against the wall, you
mother<fuckers...up against the
wall, you mother-fuckers...up
against..."

Columbia committed itself. The
militants were fighting a clear
enemy, they had become radicals.
And Mark Rudd, Columbia
University's rcvolutionist came
Wednesday night to “bend
SUNY’s mind" with his bold
pcrsuasivcness and “biased,
propuganduefillcd, hut TRUE
movie." 350 University students
sat, absorbed, us the 21 year old
activist spoke at the lecture
sponsored by the campus
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) chapter.

Rudd compared Universities
uuram a “means of production
for mechanisms of the machine."
lie condemned Exploitation,
Opreasion, Racism, and
Imperialism; be praised Education
Action through the "poWer to
win,” c nquaring the ruling class.

Rudd claimed that the
stalr~sonping, window-taping,
barricudocrecting SW "refused
to be produced.” They demanded
that students have a say in the
policies of the administration and
that their actions be taken on a

higher level of seriousness. The
SDS acted in a “cohesive way" for
the legitimacy to protest.

The movie's blood, brutality,
and realism illustrated the “masses
reacting to crisis induced by
society." Hamilton Hall
symbolized the opposition to the
war in Vietnam and a trial against
[Miriam and lmperialsim.

Columbia students, appalled by
the gap between their capability
uan what they were allowed to
do, struck out at the ruling class.
They claimed that the ruling class,
the trustees, represented the
muss—media, the CIA, the
government, and the corporation,
and that lhcy dominated
Columbia and the world. Rudd
and his strikers found a new
meaningfulness in their lives, a
common bond, u STRIKE.

University students, dazed,
agreeing, or appalled, fired
questions at Rudd. One accused
him of using the very tactics
(violence) which he so radically
opposed. Another disagreed with
the whole movement until Rudd
might find something more
suitable to replace the opposition
that he claims so heavily burdens
us now.

The Student Mental Health

have been able to receive such
help. Sltudenta, also, are enabled
to work, under close supervision,
in vital community services.

The First Annual Campus Chest
Telethon funds will also aid in

presently beginning to coordinate
these tutoring efforts and to
gather funds to further their
effectiveness.

Campus Center across from the
Information Desk, $1.00 for
students, $1.50 for faculty and
staff. Telethon is being sponsored

Student Tax Validity
To Be Aired Sunday

Tire question of the validity of
the recent Student Tax
Referendum’s held Oct 23,24 and
25 will be aired at an open
Supreme Court Hearing this
coming Sunday, Nov. 211 at 2:00
p.m. in the Campus Center
Assembly Hall.

Two separate referrals have
been presented to Supreme Court.
One was presented by Paul
Schlch and Steve Kichen, who
were the inauguarators of a
petition signed by over 2,000
students, which called for a new
election.

The second referral was
submitted by Keith Nenly, a
member of Central Council, who
is contesting the legality of the
wording of the referendum.

Both cases will be hanled as
one, according to Supreme Court
Justice Peter MacMonagle.

The procedure will be as
follows: Both Student

Association, speaking in defense
of the referendum, and those

 

contesting the referendum will
submit opening statements. They
will then call witnesses for both
sides, and will then be given the
opportunity to refute each others‘
arguments.

The floor will then be opened
to questions from the floor. All
and any students may participate
in this part of the hearing.

The issue at stake is NOT the
legality of the mandatory Student
Tax, but. rather the validity of the
referendum from which it
rubsequently became law.

The Justices of the Supreme
Court who will be judging this
case are Peter MacMonagle, Jim

olts, Paul Leiberman, Jay
Handelman and Cheryl Heater.

The decision on the case, must,
by law, be submitted within one
week of the referral.

The decision will determine
whether or not new student tax
elections are to be held.
