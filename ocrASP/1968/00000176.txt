New Approach In
Gain Fame For

Albany State debaters ‘stole the
show’ at the Vermont Invitation
Debating Tournament at the
University of Vermont this past
weekend, despite their 9-23
official record. They managed to
do this by making the proceedings
more interesting, educational, and
pleasant for those who heard
them speak.

The topic being debated was
the national collegiate topic of:

Resolved: Executive control of
United States foreign policy
should be significantly curtailed.

Debates on this topic usually
bring about sophisticated
discussion of the powers of the
President and Congress in foreign
policy. F'our members of the
Albany State squad argued a

rather unique case.

The members of the switch-side
debate team defined the chief
executive not as the president, but
as god. This unusual approach to
the topic earned Albany State
recognition as the team with the
most interesting approach to the
resolve.

Word of ‘the plan’ spread
quickly among the other schools
at the tournament. More than
once, ‘conservative‘ members of
the SUNYA squad were asked if
they were arguing the 'god case.’

The debating team of Stratton
Rawson and Tom Cervone, along
with the team of Doug
Goldschmidt and Dave Small
proposed the unique case. Each of
these debaters believe that they

Thorne Discusses
Housing Problems

by Tim Keely

Dr. Clifton C. 'l'horne,
Vice~Prcsidcnt for Student
Affairs, met with students

yesterday to discuss a possible
alternative to off campus housing
for next year. 'l‘horne has been
officiating for several weeks at the
Monday's l’rI-sIrlr-nl's Conferean
with Sludr-nls in the absence of
President lu'vun It, Collins who has
been III liurope.

'l‘lIoran‘s introductory remarks
Included ll note of congratulations
to the lenders and participants III
the UIIIVcrsity ’l‘clctlion.

A qucstion was then raised
concernlng the need for housing
that will arise next fall.

"We've talked with ten privati-
developers about building off
campus residencies for September
I, 1969. Currently we've entered
no formal agreement," Thorne
revealed.

Thorne then elaborated on the
solution that the University wri:
considering for ﬂddltiuuu.
housing.

The proposed plan would be to
encourage a builder to construct
small pro-fabricated residential
units within a reasonable distance
from the campus.

"The existence of these units
rests, however, upon several ‘lf's."
’l‘horne commented.

The list of" 'lf's’ includes: that
the land can he found that is
suitable. that the contractor
wishes to proceed, and that
toning regulailions can he met.
Should these requirements be
met, lhl) pro-fabricated units will
he installed for use by next fall.

Money to construct these units
would come from the Federal
Housing Administration.

“These units would serve the
purpose of present off campus

groups," remarked Thorne.

The units would consist of a
living—dining urea, kitchen, bath,

Court Hears Tax Cases
Decision Due Next Wee

The Supreme Court met on
Sunday afternoon in Assembly
Hall to hear evidence concerning
the validity of the Student Fee
Referendum held October 23-26.

Cheryl Heater, the Chief
Justice, along with Associate
Justices Jim Folts, Jay
Handleman, Paul Lieberman and
Pete MacMonagle listened for over
four hours to the arguments of
Duncan Nixon and Stratton
Rawson, who were respectively
representing the cases for and
against the legality of the
referendum.

Stratton Rawson was the chief
spokesman for the three
plaintiffs: Keith Nealy, Steve
Kichen and Paul Schlect. Their
attack on the referendum
contained three major arguments.
Rawson, ﬁrst cited that the voters
were not given any mason to
believe that legislation by Central

Vermont
Debaters

had received and given a more
educational experience from
arguing the ‘god case.‘

The feedback received by coach
Jeanine Rice also was of a
complimentary nature. Coaches
from other colleges thanked the
“mother of god' for making the
tournament more interesting than
it normally would have been.

While the ‘god case' (originated
by Stratton Rawson) did not
officially win debates on the
topic, it earned SUNYA's
debating squad the reputation of
producing extremely interesting
debates.

Of the more conservative
debaters, the novice team of Dave
Ballinsky and Ellen Arshamsky
went undefeated throughout the
tournament. Jan Garvey and Jan
Anagnost also succeeded in
winning a majority of their
debates as a team.

The Forensic Union meets each
Tuesday night at 7:30 in
Humanities 355.

 

Council would follow the
referendum. In the past, t
have been times when a
referendum of the student body
was nothing more than an opinion
poll.

Soconfg‘llis‘. Rawsog stated that
many 0 t e proce ures used In
cbnducting the referendum wm
improper. The plaintiffs'
contended that "the voters were
not provided with protections
consistent with Common Law,
New York State Statute, or
Student Association Statute." As
an example Rawson asserted that
New York State election laws
require that a statement of
proposition be included in the
ballot. However, the petitioners
did not believe that the part of
the ballot reading “it hereby
refers the question of a
mandatory student fee to you
(the voters]" was adequate.

Thirdly, Rawson argued that
the ballot, as worded in the
referendum, was editorialized and
biased. The ballot stated, in part,
that there is a need for “bigger,
better and more activities of ’[a]
recreational, social and education

nature.“ The plaintiffs stated that

the words "biz", better and

more" were comparative torn.“
and not neutralonea. Keith Nelly
wrote in his argument before the
court. “the onlv change called for
is not voting in a referendum, but
voting yes in the referendum."

Duncan Nixon defended the SA
opinion along with Terry Mathias,
Vice-president 01’ Central Council,
and with Mitch Foster and
Stephanie Rice, respectively
chairman and vice-chairman of
Election Commission. The
defendants presented the court an
eleven page brief which answered
Nealy's arguments on a point by
point basis.

one of the plaintiffa’
contentions was that Central
Council bill 6869-41, which called
for the referendum, did not
"make clear to the voter that the
result of the referendum would
determine whether or not we
would have a mandatory student
fee." The defense stated that
nowhere in “the constitution,
laws or enactments of Student
Association is there a requirement.
that such information must be

Faculty Urge Relief
For Biafran Children

by Barry Klrachnor

Faculty members of the
University's School of Criminal
Justice have sent a letter to
President Johnson, including a
petition, asking him to initiate
direct relief for the children of
Biafra. The petition was sent on
November 20, and was signed by

nine members of .he
department. Biafra is the
province in Southeast Nigeria

which has declared its
independence from Nigeria. While
a civil war is being fought,
thousands of Biafrans are dying
each week because supplies have
not been allowed to reach them.

Despite the impassioned pleas
of many distinguished persons
(including Senator Edward M.

Kennedy of Massachusetts), little
has been done by governments of
the world to help supply the
Biafrans with food.

The petition being sent to the
president reads:

The undersigned, members or!
the faculty of the School of
Criminal Justice of the State
University of New York at
Albany, respectfully urge our
government to initiate direct relief
shipments to the starving children
of Biafra, with or without the
assistance of available private
relief organizations and
irrespective of the possible
technical infringement of the
sovereignty of any friendly
nation.
