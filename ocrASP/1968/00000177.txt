Soviet Emigrant Talks
0n Russian Education

Anita The er
IWWhen 1 him came to New York

I felt like touching all the cars."
This was the ﬁrst impression of
Elias Lekuch, a native Russian
who emmigrated to the United
States about a year ago and is
presently a junior at RPI. Lekuch
spoke Wednesday evening as a
guest of the Russian Club in the
Humanities Faculty Lounge.

Lekuch spoke first on Russian
education. Russian students have
four years of middle school,
followed by seven demanding
years of high school. During their
last year they take 17 subjects.
Approximately one out of eight
high school students is allowed to
go on to college which usually
lasts five years.

Even when one’s education is
finished, he doesn't receive his
diploma immediately.

First the government requires
that he work for two years in an
outlying area, after which he gets
his college diploma and maybe
allowed to move to a more urban
area.

“Life in Russia is very hard and
it is difficult to make a living.”
College graduates can expect to
earn abou $150 monthly while
laborers will earn about $100.
Consequently many Russians
trade in the black market and turn
to other unlawful means.

The Soviet government policy
is that everyone should live within
his salary. Therefore a taxi driver
who accepts a tip as well as the
person who tips are both
committing legal offenses which
may result in jail sentences.

When Lekuch lived at home,
before going away to school in
Leningrad he often listend to
Voice of America broadcasts. He
said that the only American news
in Russian newspapers was about
strikes and crimes and that few
Russians have a realistic view of

The prosecution also contended
that the referendums purpose was
not clearly and properly stated.
By including thalsenten "in
order that the Student
Association may come closer to
meeting its finances, it hereby
refers the question of a
mandatory student fee to you, the
Student Body," the defense
believed that the purpose of the
referendum was clearly stated.

Chief Justice Cheryl Healer
announced at the and of the

decision on the legality of the

BUFFALO, N.Y. UPI—The
State Teachers Association
Monday voted to stage a
state-wide strike if the legislature
refuses to increase state aid to
Ichools by $140 per pupil.

The strike would be
unprecedented in the history of'
the 123-year-old organization that
represents some 123,000 teachers
outside of New York City.

The vote came as an
amendment to a resolution
proposing increased aid to
schools. The amendment was
introduced by W. Peter Quinn of
Lindenhurst School in Suffolk
County and was approved
overwhelmingly by the 1,100
delegates at the association's
annual three-day convention.

Another amendment approved
by a large margin called on the
legislature to funnel more aid into
New York’s largest cities. The
cities specifically named included
Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse,
Yonkers, Albany, and New York.

Quinn‘s amendment to the
original resolution read:

Be it further resolved that the
New York State Teachers
Association's board of directors
be directed to plan and implement
any necessary actions, including
temporary withdrawal of services

bedrooms. The decision to furnish
the units will wait until
notification of their construction.

Thorne told students that
should these units become a
reality, the University would
provide bus transportation
between residences and the
campus.

“Monthly rental costs cannot
be established as yet because we
do not know the cost. of acquiring
property," Thorne commented.

However, Thorne did comment
that the cost would run in the
“neighborhood of $140, $160,
$180" per month depending upon

the size of the unit.

In areas of other interest,
Thorne noted that the hours of
the Rathskelier had been
extended until 1:00 am. Fridays.

Thorne also made note
concerning the present course in
African History. A question arose
last week concerning the
continuation of the course.

Thorne assured students that
the course would continue next
semester. He also pointed out the
fact that the current instructor of
the course was not paid by the
history department for teaching
the course.

Council Sets Tax Assesmcnts,
Determines Grad Tax Status

by Don Stankavage

In a two hour debate, last
Thursday night, Central Council
determined the student tax
assessment for the coming spring
’69 . If the ‘ ‘ y fee
is not effective for the coming
Spring semester, the present
student assessment of $28.75 is to
be maintained.

However, if the Mandatory Fee
is effective for Spring, the student
fee will be lowered by $4.75 to
$24.00. The original proposal for
the Mandatory Fee listed a
reduction of only $2.25, but, in
the following debate, James Kahn,
supported by Linda Berdan,
demonstrated the feasibility of a
further $2.50 cut from the
Athletic Association share of the
tax.

Council members subsequently
approved this further reduction

along with a resolution in

Graduate students under the new
Mandatory Tax plan. Since
f‘ ’ ‘ students are governed
under Student Association laws,
and were allowed to vote in the
Referendum, they will be required
to pay the same Mandatory Fee

Urging each individual to “tell
it like it is" Dr. Robert Morris,
Dean of the University College
ended the University’s Fourth
Annual Thanksgiving Festival on
Sunday night.

The informal service of
Thanksgiving included a reading
from Ecclesistes, and dramatic
reading on Thanksgiving presented
by the University Readers. One of
their selections included the
reading of three familar
Thanksgiving hymns

The concluding protest song
"The Times They Are
A-Changin'" only re-enforced the
topic of Dr. Morris-Change and
the University--What Do We Have
to be Thankful For?

Morris stressed the term
university meant the educational
system in a global sense rather
than the State University at
Albany.

He posed the predominant
problem of the university in the
question, “Is the University the

leader of change or does society
lead the University to change?"

Higher education has been .the
leader in the development of
technology and science but baa
been following in the humanistic
aspects.

After citing the Mszlow theory,
that man must first have hia basic
food, clothing and shelter needl
satisfied before he can turn to the
more aesthetic ones, Dean Morris
stated the American society and
University should turn to
development of the humanistic
achievements.

However the University was
viewed as a corrupting force on
the individual. It forces people to
assess what others want from
them and then give the proper
response. I

Dean Morris concluded with
expressing thanks for a society
with guaranteed rights and a
University that protects and
encourages the freedom of speech
in an era of change and conflict.

White Racism, Liberalism

Discussed

by Barbara Heyna

Dr. Caroline Waterman of the
University Psychology
Department presented a
discussion, “is White Liberalism
Aiding White Racism," sponsored
by Cathexis, November 21. Dr.
Waterman invited audience
participation, describing the
meeting as "group therapy, an
opportunity to explore our
feelings.”

To find out students’ ideas on
what white racism is, Dr.
Waterman asked for definitions of
the term. Even from the relatively
small group gathered, it was
evident that blacks and whites
differed in their interpretations of
the concept.

“Whites see white racism as
something that the bigols do,
something out there," observed
Dr. Waterman. “To the blacks,
white racism is pervasive and it is
here in this room. The white man
says there are white racists but
l’m not one of them. The black
man says they are here and you
may be one of them."

As an introduction to
discussion, Dr. Waterman cited
the conclusion of the Kerner
iieport that white racism is
responsible for civil disorder.
Although [he report docs not.
define Wiiilt!_ racism, Dr.
Waterman interprets the turm as
referring to “white society in
general, not only those who
nctivniy discriminate but those
who by their apathy have
perpetuated the system."

"Why would a white liberal like
a doctrine that calls him a white
racist?” intcrjectcd Dr. Waterman.
Students responded that whites
wanted to_bc condemned so they

would be able to relieve their
guilt.

The programs which have been
initiated in the black community,
although they may have meant
well have served mainly to
alleviate the white man's guilt‘,
believes Dr. Waterman. White
liberals have sponsored corrective
programs in those areas where it is
easiest. .

Many felt that drastic action
must be taken immediately, that a
discussion of white racism does

means by which white liberals are
able to relieve their conscience

Some members of the audience
felt that the discussion was
evading the real issue: when are
vou going to stop bullshitting
around and get to the point?‘
You're not solving my problem,
you‘re not even getting to the
root of the problem,

Dr. Waterman responded by
saying that she couldn't solve
these problems, that at best, the
students would leave thinking

nothing to eradicate it, but is a . about the problems,
