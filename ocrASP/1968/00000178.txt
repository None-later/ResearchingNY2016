As in past years, the total enrollment of the University will increase
by about 1,100 students. This number includes all part-time and
full-time graduates and undergraduates. The ﬁnal decision of how many
students out of the 1,100 will be full time undergraduates has not been
made.

The domtitory facilities must be taken into account when the
decision is made as to how many full time undergraduates will be
admitted. Over crowding in the dorms will not cause a student revolt,
but living in such situations tends to cause unnecessary tensions and
does not create the best atmosphere for a University life.

Greater increased occupancy is planned already for next year. The
increase, though, will be relatively small and similar to the system of
two years ago. But, if the Admissions Ofﬁce is told to increase the

enrollment of the full-time undergraduate body to an amount that

exceeds 400-500 students, Residences may be in trouble.

There will be room for 350 students over normal occupancy if the
above plan of increased occupancy is put into effect. The complement
amount of increased student population will probably want to live off
campus. Already the University is making plans for the arrangement of
more off-campus housing that it feels will be desirable to the student.
Perhaps it is hoped that this new housing will encourage more students

to live off campus.

But, if the number of students who wish to be housed on campus is
more than the anticipated amount, then the Residence Ofﬁce will be
faced with a situation which will make this summer’s headaches seem

like'a vacation.

There must be more part-time students and graduate students
admitted this year than last year. In this manner, the number of

students who want to live on campus next year will not be so large that
it will necessitate the overcrowding of dorms or the refusing to

accomodate the transfer student.

The administration must decrease the percentage of underclassmen
admitted into the University next year.

 

 

Colonial’s Lot

To the Editor:

On November 11, 1968, [was
unfortunate enough to receive a
traffic violation for parking in the
"Faculty-Administration” lot
during the day. 1 ordinarily do not
put my car there; however, urgnet
business plus a ﬁlled and corroded
resident parking lot across from
Colonial Quad forced me to do
this.

Writing this letter will probably
not fix the numerous and
dangerous pot holes on Colonial
Quad; 1 hope though It will
encourage those representatives
on the appropriate councils to
reconsider certain established
rules and regulations about
parking.

Firstly, l should like for them
to realize that this University (as
well as most) has dichotomized
itself into two broad areas:
“faculty and staff" and
"students." One can notice this
distinction not only by signs but
also by noninteraction between
these two groups; they are, in
effect, isolated from one another
physically which does not
enhance the possibility of much
needed communication between
these two groups (as was the case
at Columbia University).

The separation of various
elements within a society lncreses
the chances of creating a “Us” and
"them" type of relationship, such
that can be seen In the “Inner”
and "outer" city (slum and
suburbia, respoctively),etc.

I realize that little interaction
between students and faculty-staff
will take place on the parking lots
of this University, but by erasing

privileges through distinctions not
only in parking, in the library, and
in other sanctuaries, we can then
perhaps make a step towards
increasing interaction.

Let us not fail to forget an
underlying fact-of-life at
Columbia: the channels of
communication were virtually
closed by mental and physical
obstacles created not by the
students but by those who could
not comprehend why there were
students in their buildings,
shouting and defying the
administration (whom the
students could not differentiate
from the faculty); that is, the
faculty-staff.

1 do not predict that this
University will erupt as Columbia
did, nor is that my desire. 1 do
think that by having "class"
distinctions and labels we create
our own barriers to a university
which shold have only one body:
a community of scholars.

Yours truly,
John J. Fleitmun

just we
feel is fundamentally at issue is
that time honored principle of
majority rule.

How in anyone’s mind this
principle has come to mean the
rule of only those who aren't
apathetic is not altogether beyond
me, but how II has come to be
held as inevitable is. Putting aside
my own personal doubt that all
who didn’t vote in the referendum
are thus apathetic, the question
comes to mind whether apathy
can be used to justify any course
of action. Those of us who still
hold to the rule of the many, as
clearly binding majority and not
as a convenient number, may be
dismissed as being cute but naive.
But the dismissal combined with
an attempt at a justification along
the lines of “that is the way things
work and what can we do if so
many are apathetic" smells
strongly of burnt consciences.

There is no reason in my mind
(except want of speed) why a
majority, not just of those
"concerned enough" but of all
those affected, could not have
been reached; if indeed they were
needed. Given the responsibility
of those who know to inform
those who might like to know, the
appeal to tho "apathy thing"
appears as a rather easy way out
of nn uncomfortable situation.
After nil, to expect an individual
today to take It upon himself to
ﬁnd out all the fine details of a
proposed referendum is not only
to expect extreme courage of the
individual, but also provides those
who know a convenient way out
of their duty to inform-inform
not condition. The question could
be further put whether today's
individual is really expected to
perform such a role.

Apathy isn't the natural
product of two or more genes nor
does it create itself: and in my
mind it’s the creator not his
creation who must correct the
wrong. If apathy has become, as I
feel it has for many, a justification
for the ideal’s inability to get over
the wall and into reality, then it's
time for a change-'a change
toward communication and away
from name calling.

Grandfather invited the
strangest people to his
Thanksgiving dinner. Two
southerners from the country of
Salt, Big Jo and Little 130 were
there, squabbling with each other
as usual. From the northern
Pepper nation, there was the
Emperor Minh Chi Ho. And to
round out his list, Grandpa invited
his son,Nikey.

Grandpa and Nikey made
introductions and greetings to
everyone. Tears were in
Grandfather’s eyes as he sat Nikey
down at the head of the table.
With everyone seated, the huge
turkey was brought out by a
Greek waiter, Squeaky Nono.

“Here’s the turkey," said the
Greek waiter to Grandpa, “just
like all the other ones."

“No it's not stupid," said
Nikey, pushing the waiter out of
the way. “This is Grandfather’s
special, prize turkey."

“Right you are Nikey, and I
offer it because I have but little
time left," said Grandpa.

Everyone looked at Grandpa
with surprise.

The southerner, Big Jo,
stomped his feet, crying, "You
mean no more free dinners
Grandpa?"

Emperor Minh Chi Ho smiled.
“All things come to an end, even
Grandpa‘s prize turkey."

“That is true,” responded
Grandpa, “but this turkey is not
finished yet. Nikey still has to
curve it up."

"Give me the greatest share
Nikeyll” everyone yelled.

Nikey began to carve but found
his knife too dull. “Stupid
waiter," he shouted, “go get a
knife!"

Running out, Emperor Minh
tripped him, the Greek waiter
sprawling to the floor. The

The next four years are
undoubtedly the most important
in American history, merely
because the “next four years"
always are. What should our aims
be? The answer is conservatism.

The goal of any society should
be a static state, not stemming
from a social immorality or an
apathetic admonition which we
are now recipients of, if we abide
by conservative standards.

When can we retard liberalism
and settle down in our terminal
conservative utopia? In my usual
optimistic fashion, I predict never.
I contend that man will never
cease his seemingly inherent
function of listing man. There is
no indication that killing is
coming to a halt. If these
contentions are valid, why even
bother seek our static stutc'.’

My reply is simply that I don’t
know. The only explanation is
that man's drives force him to
constantly better himself
economically, socially, and even,
on occasion, morally.

We have it good now, right?
Only by comparison. Today's
conservative has more justification
in his moral beliefs than did a
conservative fifty years ago. llut
that doesn't make his erccds
completely justifiable.

‘ Ergo, we must be liberal, which
today is synonomous with left
wing politics. Nice try, but you
get another guess. Merely wanting
to change a society (loos not
necessarily imply that we will
better it, particularly when
politically, we compel ourselves to
accept an unproven dogma.

The desire to “better” their
societies led such liberals as Hitler,
Mussolini, and Stalin to positions
of importance. 1 choose not to
elaborate, but if the preceding

  

 
   

southerners laughed.

“On second thought," said the
Emperor, “I don't want a piece.
Just give me the stuffing."

Everyone gasped. “That's our
security!" screamed Nikey.

“You can’t have our security!”
everyone chanted at the Emperor.

“What do you mean? I’ve been
invited to dinner haven’t I?"
yelled the Emperor.

Nikey replied, “Well, yes, but
Thanksgiving is an American
holiday, and Americans 'always
come first.”

“Does that exclude us too?"
asked the southerners huffily.

Grandpa said no; but Nikey
insisted, “Yes it does. Americans

are first in everything, only
Americans."
Emperor Minh laughed. The

southerners got up and walked
out.

“Where are you going fellows?"
asked Grandpa. “You didn’t even
have any cranberries yet."

“Let them go," said Nikey. “I’ll
go find Squeaky and get the knife
and cranberries. You watch the
turkey Grandpa."

Only Grandfather and the
Emperor were left now. “What a
messy dinner," cried Grandpa,
“whatever will my biographers say
about this!”

The Emperor had moved closer
to the turkey while Grandpa was
crying. He suddenly grasped it, his
hand going into the stuffing.

Just then Nikey, knife in hand
and Squeaky at his side, reentered
the room. Seeing the Emperor,
Nikey lunged for him, grabbing at
the turkey.

But squeaky the waiter lunged
too, and the turkey slipped from
their hands, splattering on the
floor. The turkey was a mess, and
nothing was left of the stuffing.

The point that must not elude
us is that we have created in
slightly less than 200 years, the
best society the world has known,
if only in economic terms, though
I reserve the right to seriously
question that limitation.

We’re not the worst racists in
history. We‘re more tolerant
(which perhaps should be stntcd
emphatically) than most of our
previous generations. What makes
intolerance in crime for us today is
not its comparative magnitude,
rather our cognizance of this
intolerance.

When man is able to hate, know
he shouldn't, and not wonder
why, some screws need tightening.
In the past, man hated but he
knew why, so w forgive him
because his knowledge was based
on invalid assumptions.

Mr
to make man a ward of the state

From an address delivered at
the Third Annual Conference on
Student Affairs at SUNYA:

"Gentlemen and Greeks, in
response to a recent. flurry of
questions regarding the state of
the University, I would like to
offer a few remarks to clarify
certain issues which irresponsible
moderates have been asking of
late.

The first so-called question
raised concerns the scarcity of
books on the shelves in the
library. Now don’t quote me, but
one of the possible reasons may
possibly be that the boolrs have
not been reshelved, this does not
mean that we have a scarcity of
books, and it doesn’t mean that
we do, what it does mean is that
we have a scarcity of books on the
shelves in the library. The second
reason is, as it is often said by
some, that a field house and
fountains are more important
than a library—after all, you
know, a university isn’t build on
books.

And about the wind. Now some
irresponsible columnists have
alluded to the fact that the great
amount of wind on this campus
eminates from our Central
Council. But I think this is a
semantic question—wind should
not be confused with hot air.

Seriously, those who object to
the 200 mph winds that roar
through the campus have no
understanding of the grand
scheme of the architect who was
only interested in promoting
hygiene. For you see all this wian
hopping about creates ventilation
which blows away all of the stale
air and ideas that pervade in
universities. And the dust (which
is rumored to originate from the
faculty lounge) that the wind
blows into the rooms is actually a

  

 

 

(socialists prefer the term “his
fellow man”). It gives man the
credit for being as intelligent as an
earthworm, and forces him to live
in the social atmosphere of a herd
of cattle. If this is a true
statement about men's
intelligence; it is nevertheless
impcrtinent. He must NEVER be
treated ast animal.

department to force physical
fitness down your throat. For you
see the constant wiping, moplng,
and dusting builds up the arm and
abdominal muscles so that all of
our students will be in shape to
play football. And besides, the
land was cheap.

And this thing about the state
policy being that low-bid
construction is the best
construction. Well, all I can say
about that is that I certainly
cannot speak for the state. But
let’s face the facts: concrete is
concrete and those cracks are
merely signs that the University is
well established. Besides, no one

And contrary to popular belief,

Now to conclude, for I have to

proverb we should all keep in
mind: “Don’t spit in the soup, we
all have to sleep there.”

The basic issue of student
power is in-loco-parentis. The
power plays on college campuses
throughout the country involve
curfews, a voice in curriculum, cry
for pass‘fail guidelines, alcohol on
campus, banning of ROTC and
military on campus, students on
faculty-administration
committees, a voice in decision
making and free speech and a free
press.

According to Professor Dario
Politella of the University of
Massachusetts, we are living in a
“golden age of student
journalism." Over nine million

“Statesman,” a student newspaper
at Stony Brook, in a front page
editorial demanded that President
Toll resign for intellectual
dishonesty in telling what the
"Statesman" called "shameful lies
in his reasons for tripling of
student dorm rooms."

The power of the student press
is being watched closely in state
legislatures in Wisconsin,
Michigan, Texas and other states
where independent student papers
have lashed out at the
military-industrial complex, the
depletion oil-allowance, campus
Presidents, at the state legislatures

 

students in over 2000
read student newspapers costing
over $35 million, and produce
yearbooks costing over $25
million. If the cost of unrewarded
labor were included it would
reach 'a billion dollars!

The student press today on
many campuses is seeking fiscal
independence from both the
administration and their student
governments. Recent examples
include “The Daily Califorian"
and “The Daily Pennsylvanian,"
who “could no longer safeguard
its editorial freedom with subsidy
from student government." NSA,
the USSPA, and the AAUP have
come out strongly for fiscal
autonomy for the student press
because it would lead to more
independent action and a more
responsible press.

The power of the student press
has manifested itself most
stronlgly in the cry for student
power, the war in Vietnam, an
end to the draft, and campus
President chasing. Recently, the

t‘“ '. , or L ,' ’ the
freedom of the press with such
columns as “Student as Nigger"
which are sprinkled with four
letter words. More frequently
student editorials get press
treatment in the "New York
Times” and other mass media
papers. Several college papers have
sent reporters to Vietnam, such as
the “Queens College Phoenix," to
involve the campus more fully in
the war. And the College Press
Service has reporters in Vietnam,
Europe, the East and West
Coasts, as well as a Washington
bureau and operates a college wire
service.

There is no question that the
student press is getting more
professional. One only has to look
at such papers as the “Michigan
Daily" or the “Harvard Crimson.”
Freedom of the college press is
well-justified. For it is the student
press who takes over where the
profossor leaves off—by
stimulating thought and
discussion in the search for truth.

In fact the entire mesa appears
petty if only because it should
never have happened in the first
place. Given a commitment to the
spirit and not to the so called
reality of those "democratic
principles,” the whole situation
should have been given more
thought.

Censored
To the Editor:

We were terribly shocked by
the ASP report of November 22
which quoted on the front page a
phrase from Mark Rudd ’s speech.
Now everyone knows that Mark
Rudd cannot be quoted correctly
without using a number of
fonr~letter words. But the fact
that the editor should allow such
,words to be printed on the front
page of a student news” ls

reason for great consternation.

We understand that the ASP
this year is dedicated to upholding
the highest principles of good
taste. We, therefore, implore the
editor never again to allow the
boys and girls who read the paper
to be subject to the hideous
vulgarities that graced the front
page of the ASP last Friday.

Still blushing at the editor's
obvious mistake, we remain two

To the Editor:

Concerning the letter of

Greek Echo. [Sb would like to
'Iurlfy what We feel is u

isconccption of Greek Spirit.

Corislder the following:

I. it is not true that Greeks are

 

fined if we do not walk behind
our floats, we do it willingly
because we enjoy being part of
our group.

2. It is not true that Greeks are
punished for no helping on
constructing the ﬂoats.

3. The purpose of the
scholarship cup is to encourage
each group to maintain high
academic standards.

4. The percentage of inactivity
is minimal for many and varied
reasons, but, not for loss of spirit.
lnactives are still members who
can and do participate in sorority
activities.

5. We realize that spirit is not
limited to Greeks alone, uni that
the student organizations and
activities are composed of both
independents and Greeks.

A person takes pride In any
groups to which they belong. and
we are individually proud of our
own sororities. '
