Anti-Vietnam

Students Raid 
NYU Lectures 

NEW YORK (UPI) — Dr.
James M. Hester. president of
New York University (NYU),
Thursday condemned raids by
radicals on two campus meet-
ings as "crude and revolting"

and said two raiders had been. 

identified as NYU students and
suspended.

More than 50 young persons
swarmed into the university’s
student center last night, threw
a pitcher of water and an egg
on South Vietnam’s observer at
the United Nations, Nguyen Huu
Chi, then disrupted another
meeting where James Reston,
executive editor of The New
York Times. was giving an
address. One raider was arrest-

e . .

The Students for a Democra-
tic Society (SDS), the new left
group which has stirred revolts
at Columbia University and
other institutions in the city,
issued a leaﬂet which claimed
credit for the raids.

Hester said any NYU student
identified as having taken part
in the raids would be suspend—
ed, pending further disciplinary
action by a committee of the
Student Faculty University Sen-
ate. He said persons identified
as nonstudents would be
charged before civil authorities.
There were reports that some
of the raiders were Columbia
University students.

“The disruption of speeches
. . was a crude and revolting
violation of the most basic
principles of the university,”
Hester said at a news con~
fernce. “Violent interference
with the rights of others to
speak and to be heard
demonstrates gross insensitivity
to the requirements of member-
ship in the university  such
unprincipled disregard of the
fundamental human courtesy on
which the life of the academic
community is built cannot be
tolerated.”

SEANYS

Program

Aids Ed. Majors

The Student Education
Association of New York State
(SEANYS) is a statewide
professional organization for both
public and private college and
university students who have
shown an interest in the teaching
profession as a career.

It is sponsored by the New
York State Teachers Association.
SEANYS is also affiliated on the
national level through the Student
National Education Association.
(Student NEA).

It would seem natural for an
education-oriented organization
such as SEANYS to be present at
a university like this one, which
evolved from a “teachers college.”

During the present year,
however, SEANYS is ‘ u ' a
“rebirth” on campus through
regenerated interest in the club on
the part of education majors and
through expanded club activities.

The success of SEANYS’
renewed vigor has been reflected
in it’s ﬁrst event of the year—A
Student Teachers Panel Program,
which was held on November 19.

The purpose of this Panel
Program was to enable education
majors to find out what student
teaching is “all about" by
providing an opportunity for
them to question a group of
students who had recently
completed their student teaching.

Young

Holds Chic

by Peggy Blast! and Bill O’Ksln

The Young Socialist Alliance
held its national convention at. the
University of Illinois in Chicago
over Thanksgiving vacation.
Student revolutionaries from
France, Mexico, Canada, Iran,
Japan, Germany, and the
Dominican Republic participated
in the convention in addition to
YSAers from every section the
United States.

The national convention is held
annually to decide the policy and
frame the national guidelines of
the organization for the coming
year. Each local chapter of YSA
elects delegates who represent the
group by participating in
discussions and voting on the
resolutions proposed by the
national committee.

The convention began on
Thursday. November 28, with the
first of four reports on the main
areas of action for YSA: anti-war
work, Black self‘delermination,
new youth radicalization, and
political alliance with the Socialist
Worker‘s Party.

Included in the activities of the
four-day convention were original
ﬁlms of the May-June French
revolts; speeches by Black Panther
Party representatives and George
Novak, a leading Socialist writer

and philosopher; and a celebration
party. In addition, were panels

discussing international youth
radicalization, minority group
problems, and GI. anti-war
activity.

Nation-wide publicity was given
to the convention an a result of
the protest by an Illinois state
Senator to the fact that an openly
radical youth group was using the
facilities of a tax-supported
university. The 1968 convention
was the largest to be held since
the YSA was formed in 1960. The
group has more than doubled its
size since the 1967 convention
and currently has chapters on 101
campuses in the United States and
numerous U.S. high schools.

Members of various Leftist
groups who attended included
representatives from SDS, Black
Panther Party, Peace and Freedom
Party, Worker ’3 League,
Spartisans, Socialist Labor Party,
and the Communist Party.

The Albany YSA members who
attended the convention have
begun preparations to bring
leading speakers in the socialist.

including George Novak and Paul

SUNYA Lacks Color

’I‘wo Buffalo University
students have described the
Albany State campus as “The
World‘s Fair Gotham
City—the year that the plague
wiped out the populace.”

Throughout the body of a three
page story, which appeared in the
U. of B. Spectrum on Nov. 19,
Linda Hanlcy, Feature Editor of
The Spectrum, the official
University paper, makes reference
to the absencu of activity, the
seeming luck of students. and the
sterility of the Albany Campus of
the State University.

l’hrah’cs such as “hollow
dcsenlion (on) an uncampuh'
campus" and "there are no
students on this campus" are seen
throughout the story.
Accompanying the feature ilri‘
eight photos of thc campusr'all of
which show a marked absence of
studme life on campus. Alan
Gruhcr, Asst. Photo Editor. and
Miss llunicy took the pictures and
gained the information for the
story on a trip to the campus late
on weekday afternoon last month.

The story and photos with il
have been done in an essay
manner. Figurativo descriptions of
the campus such as this
onc~“'l‘hoy (the students) have
become assimilated into endch
stretches of black and white;
shrunk behind the dark glass;
taken hiding in hack of millions of
wafer-thin white columns; been

crushed by flying saucers when
the chains finally broke."~are
sprinkled throughout the story.

in closing, Hanley states, “The
campus has an unnatural qua
about it of not having been
designed for students . . . All
around everything seems just a
facet of a very beautiful work of
art, but somehow not a campus."

Collins Discusses
LAAC’s Reforms

by Tim Keeley

President Evan R. Collins, back
from his recent visit to Europe,
discussed the LAAC bill
concerning resident policies with

students at The President’s
Conference with Students on
Monday.

Collins noted that the bill was
still in “the channels”, but “if it
reaches me before December 12 I
will bring my recommendations
before the University Council.”

Vic Looper. chairman of
LAAC. remarked that points I and
II of the bill dealing with the
abolition of freshmen hours and
the abolition of signout had
received faculty approval. Looper
further anticipated the approval
of point IV concerning the option
of closing doors during open room
visitation .

The thrid provision of the bill
which would allow the individual
halls to decide the length of time
open room visititaions wqpld last
was sent back to LAAC for
revision. The question of
administering that point was
raised by the faculty.

Collins while in accord with the
bill noted that “I would like to
deal with the provisions as a
package plan."

Golden Eye To View
Scientology Tonight

by John O’G rsdy

Neil Brown, director of the
Scientology Center in Albany, will
speak tonight at the “Golden
Eye." The talk will ‘begin at 9
p.m., admission is free; the “Eye”
is located at 820 Madison Avenue
downtown. The purpose of the
talk, said Brown, will be to
acquaint those interested with the
“promise of Scientology," its
possibilities for bettering the
conditions in which an individual
learns and lives.

Scientology is a world-wide
movement founded rather
recently by an American writer
and adventurer named L. Ron
Hubbard. Hubbard's best-selling
book, "Dianetics, the Modern
Science of Mental Health,”
appeared in 1950; its success led
to the transformation of dianctics
(the study of the workings of the
mind, or spirit) from a mere
subject of research into an
effective method of changing
people for the better. known as
Scientology.

In a recent interview, Brown
defined Scientology as “an
applied religious philosophy with
a technology that betters
conditions"; other than this
statement he was surprisingly
reticent about the methods of
