A New Club: Student Association

 

A new club was created by Supreme Court this week, and it will be known by the
name of Student Association. Once Student Association was regarded as the body to
which one looked to for the expression of the student body. If Supreme Court's
deﬁnition of the representative powers of Central Council, as expounded in its recent
judgement on the Student Fee Referendum, is not withdrawn, then Student
Association may as well fold up. Since the court ruled that Central Council was not
composed of any “duly elected representatives of the student body as a whole,"
Council could not represent the student body, i.e., declare a mandatory student fee on
the basis of the vote taken by the student body on October 23, 24, and 25. If this
judicial decision is extended to the other aspects of the student government, then no
governmental branch of Student Association can act on anything that will affect all

students, since it cannot represent the student body.

The seriousness of this decision lies in the fact that one function of Student
Association, the representation of the student body, has been banned. No longer can
the Faculty look upon the student who sits on their committee as a representative of
the student body. No longer can that student feel justiﬁed as a representative of the
student body, even though he is representin

future of all the students.

President Collins cannot, according to the court‘s decision, go to
Central Council, LAAC, or [he Supreme Court itself to ascertain the
position of the student body on any issue. The president, or any other
administrative official.to obtain the opinion of the student body must
either ask Council to conduct a poll, present their own poll, or ignore
the interpretation of Supreme Court and consider Central Council the
representative student voice on campus. Of the alternatives, the

administration is likely to choose the latter.

Supreme Court has taken. in effect, its concept of representation and
applied it not only to Chancellor Gould’s Student Fee Statement, but
also to any future administrative directive that addresses itself to the

Button’s Protest

To the Editor:

Congressman Button's recent
attack on Mark Rudd's
appearance at the State University
at Albany reveals a total lack of
comprehension of our
constitutional guarantees for free
speech.

Regardless of his viewpoint, Mr.
Rudd has a basic right to present
his ideas, as do all of us, in the
free exchange of ideas among
intelligent listeners. The New
York Legislature, like the State
University, it also a tax-supported
institution, where many
unpopular statements are made
and defended by the legislators.
We doubt Mr. Button would deny
any legislator his right to speak,
even though his views are
vigorously opposed by all other
legislators.

We of the New York Civil
Liberties Union believe that Mr.
Button has a right to express his
opinions opposing Mr. Rudd's

The Ri

by Robert lee-sen

 

 

“But the university belongs to
the students!!” How often have
we heard this phrase used to
rationalize student unrest? It
appears that many students,
especially on state campuses such
as ours, have forgotten where the
money comes from to construct
the buildings, hire the faculty, and
generally keep the university
operating.

No. Universities such as
SUNYA do not belong to the
students alone, but are the
property of the people of New
York State, the people who have
been taxed to pay for the
facilities. And, as owners of the
university, they have as much
right to decide the policies of the
school as we do. The only thing
that makes us different from them
is the fact that we have been given
the opportunity to attend the
school.

No one is bound to go to
college against his will, and
conversely, no one can claim that.
a college education is one of his
“inalienable rights.” We cannot
say that we are being forced to
live or study under intolerable
conditions because no one is
forced to stay. However, the
privilege of remaining a student at
a given university could and
should be revoked when students
forcibly try to make policy that
they have no right to make.

Attending college is a privilege
that depends on the student
agreeing to abide by the rules of
the university; rules established
and enforced by the
representatives of the people, or
in other words the administration,
trustees etc.

listene to have to stop and wait
while someone poorly altempts to
ﬁx the microphone. lt's true that
the gym is not the greatest place
to hold such events, but since it’s
the only place available, why not
make the best of what we have?

We have some good concerts
coming up soon. Are they fated to
be run in the typical University
tip-top manner or is someone
going to finally break down and
learn how to operate and possibly
improve our public address
system? The latter I hope!

Secondly, a t,uestion bothering
numerous students concerns the
sale of tickets to the
Collins—Union Gap concert. If
many students on campus weren't
able to purchase tickets who had
the right, or rather the nerve, to
sell them off campus? Could it be
that more money can be made by
selling tickets at a higher price to
high school kids and other people
than to students on our own
campus? This is one of those
glorious benefits of paying
student tax; so you don't have to
pay $4.00 for tickets to concerts,
etc.

No! But you might not get any
anyway. Shouldn't students on
the campus get some preference in
buying tickets? If there weren‘t
enough to go around then we
should get them first. Is it right
that. some students had to pay
$8~$10 or more to purchase a
ticket to their own concert which
many helped to pay for? Someone
better come up with some quick
and good explanations. There are
a few people who don‘t want to
miss the next good concert. l for

alternatives if we disarm
certain policies. We can leave and
go elsewhere, or we can work with
the administration to have the
undesirable rules changed. But we
cannot. demand that they be
changed, claiming that the
university belongs to the students,
and that the students can thereby
demand alterations in policy.

One of the most controversial
areas of decision-making concerns
the hiring and ﬁring of professors.
I agree that students should have
advisory roles in deciding such
things as tenure (as we do here)
but the ultimate power in this
area must rest with the
administration, unless it is
properly delegated to the
students.

Recent unrest at San Francisco
State College has revolved around
the suspension of a part-time
professor. Black Panther George
Mason Murray was temporarily
released for suggesting that
students carry guns to classes to
protect themselves from “racist.
administrators." Militant students,
black and white, clashed with
police and closed the school
because of the suspension. They
claim that the students must
decide who will teach them and
what they are to be taught; that
the university belongs to them.

Only when they pay for the
buildings and the professor‘s
salaries can they justly claim this
power. Until that time, the right
to dismiss or suspend teachers is
held by all the people of
California, who are represented by
the administration. Furthermore,
once a student decides to voice his
opinions in a way contrary to the

inconsiderate, 2) dangerous, and
3) short-sighted.

It is even more inconsiderate to

their evaluations; they will have to

of the American Bar Association,
expressed it this way, “Student

their lawlessness, have forfeited
any right to remain as members of

sooner they are expelled from

I bought a copy of Suppression
last week and found an open
letter to a Chi Sig pledge, or was
it? Seems strange that a
publication that supposedly deals

with moral questions should
disregard little morals; e.g.,
personal letters, and yet be

righteous about big morals. Leads
one to believe that perhaps these
people are irresponsible toward
society and that this

irresponsibility carries over to the
morality with which

they

notes in papers and essay tests,
the poor faculty member might. be
upset by something new! Is this
fair?!

2) S-U grading is dangerous for
several reasons. First, it lessens
the “joy of competition" (or “lust
for the kill", as Robert Ardrey
might describe it). Furthermore,
where it has been tried (such
radical hotbedsas Berkeley and
Columbia and Brown, Oberlin,

Lehigh, Mount Holyoke,
Princeton, Stanford, Rutgers
Michigan, Cal Tech, etc.), the

results have been disastrous!

The faculty at these asshole
have noted that more students
read books (even unassigned and
unsuggested bookslll); the
drop-out rate, especially for the
better students, decreases (and
we're overcorwded now!!!);
conformity decreases!!!; and more

students either participate in
“honors” courses, independent
study or community service

projects or take courses just
because they might be interested
in them (with no though to
requirements or practical use to
their major!!!) This is definitely
carrying educational
irresponsibility too far!

3) My final objection to S-U
grading is that it is short—sighted.
What if our students do learn to
challenge the "final answers" and
“eternal veritiea” our faculty have
arrived at over the many years?
Do you think it will stop there?
No! If this sort of thing gets out
of hand, our new answers and
verities may be challenged by the
next generation, or even the next
freshman class! In this progress?!

It is also short-sighted in that it
weakens the ethos of the
successful player of “The
G ume"--and how many of us or
the faculty are truly without sin
here?! Eventually we won’t know
whom to believe and may even

 
  

supposedly deal. II this is so, then
they are truly what they seem,
psuedo.
