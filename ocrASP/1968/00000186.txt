Male Chorus of Cohoes which will perform here Monday.

Traditions Of Old Russia

Kept Alive

by Joe .lurczynski

The Russian Club is sponsoring
a concert of Russian folk and
liturgical music performed by the
Russian Orthodox Male Chorus of
Cohoes, New York, on Monday
evening December 16, at 8:00 P.
M. in the Campus Center
Ballroom.

Originating from St. Nicholas‘
Russian Orthodox Parish in
Cohoes, the prime objective of the
Chorus is to keep the beautiful
and traditional customs of old
Russia alive and living through
their music.

Under the direction of Ronald
Geleta, the 26 member, all male
chorus sings in four part harmony
with no accompaniment other
than a C tuning fork for pitch.

This absence of instrumental
accompaniment, coupled with a
tremendous bass sound creates a
quality of bigness and beauty that

is so essential to Russian music
and so typical of the male chorus.

The concert will be sung
completely in Russian, but
comments on the meaning and
origin of each song will be given in
English. The first part of the
concert will consist of liturgical
music including “The Lord’s
Prayer" by Kedroff, “Of Thy
Mystical Supper” by Lvov, and
“Thrice Holy” by Tchaikovsky.

The sombre melodies and
emotion expressed in these
selections beautifully portray the
religious customs of the Russian
Orthodox Church.

In the second part of the
concert, the tempo picks up to
the spirited and cheerful folk
songs of Russia including
“Borodino,” “Warrior's Prayer,"
“March of the Horsemen,” and
“Evening Bells."

The Russian Club, in acquiring

During the past week the TXO
pledge class collected money for

the March of Dimes. Several
weeks ago the brothers of TXO

took up collections at several.

shopping centers in the immediate
area.

There were two principle
purposes for the collections: first
and foremost was to help the
March of Dimes in its campaign to
help others; the second purpose
was to get the brothers of TXO to
become more actiVely involved in
community affairs,

Since no particular goal was set
and the sum of $215.36 was
collected It was felt that the drive
was successful. In the future the
brothers of TXO will organize
other collection campaigns for
other community groups.

Council Passes Six Bills

Before

by Don Stankavage
Central Council, with a rapidly
deteriorating quorum, passed six
bills Thursday night before four
members left and forced the
suspension of business.

26 members were present to
vote on the first two bills which
were minor adjustments in Budget
Procedure concerning Student
Association financed
organizations. These both passed
by identical votes, 25-0~1. 26
members were also present to pass
a Holiday Sing appropriation of
$150; 24-0-2.

The next order of business was
reevaluation of the Athletic
Advisory Board (AAB) and its
relation to Central Council.
Important AAB oriented Faculty
and Administrative officials were
present to answer Central Council
member's questions pertaining to
the AAB and its past procedures.

Copeland On Economy
Discusses ’69 Outlook

by Jane D'Amico

The EI-onomics Club presented
Professor Morris A. Copeland of
the University's Economic
Department, on Friday, December
6, in the Campus Center Assembly
Hall.

Copeland, internationally
known for his work on “national
income accounting," expressed his
views on the “Economic Outlook
for 1969," with particular respect
to deescnlntion of the Vietnam
War and the monetary policies of
the new administration.

Predicted economic figures for
the first half of next year were
based on two assumptions stated
by Copeland.

First, anything in the way of
deescaluiion as a result of the
Paris Pence negotiations would
have a definite effect on the
figures presented.

Second, the fiscal policy of the
new administration will not alter,
but will continue on the course
initiated by the present
administration.

In accordance with his first
assumption, Copeland predicted :1

Among these AAB
representatives were Dr. John R.
Tibbetts, Professor of Education,
Clifton C. Thorne,Vice-President
for Student Affairs, and Dr.
Alfred C. Werner, Chairman of the
Physical Education Dept.

After the questioning of these
AAB associates was completed,
only 24 Council members were
present to vote 27-1-1 to request
information from AAB
concerning the athletic budget
and Fee and to send back to AAB
rule changes and clarifications
suggested by Council President
Duncan Nixon.

Two more Council members
left after the AAB vote, leaving
only the minimum quorum of 22
members to confirm the
appointments of Linda Berdan,
James Kahn, and Richard Grey to
the Faculty Senate Council for
Promotion and continuing

normal increase in prices (49%
for the first half of the year, 7.4%
for the second), if there should be
no substantial deescalation.

Conversely, a substantial
deescalation or cease fire would
initiate a mild recession and our
balance of payments would
improve.

In reference to his second
assumption, Copeland expounded
his opinion that by the second
half of the your the fiscal power
of the administration would be
limited due to new commitments.

Copeland went on to explain
that at present we are in the
"upswing stage of the business
cycle that began in the first
quarter of 1961." He cited the
longest previous upswing as having
occurred during World War II,
spanning a period of over six
years.

Copeland was of the opinion
that the "monetary expansion
policies of the Federal Reserve
Board to tighten credit by raising
interest rates can not deal with
inflation much."

which we have had in the past.
Rather than emphasia'ng the more
stilted and formal aspects of the
event, the co-chairmen have
chosen to concentrate on the
creation of a relaxing atmosphere.

The evening will begin at nine
o.clock with a buffet dinner

upward revision of the standard

dormitory program on a sound

The present rate of $380 for
the standard room combined with
the State subsidy of $230 falls
short of the $790 total per bed
cost estimated for next year.

Chancellor Gould stated that
on July 1, 1969 the new standard
room rate per student would be
$550, assuming that the State
continues to provide the same
level of subsidy toward total per
bed cost. The State subsidy
requested in the proposed
1969-70 University budget is
approximately $230 per bed.

Further, the Chancellor said the
standard room rental would have
to be $560 were it not for the fact
that it is estimated the differential
can be made up from other
income available between July 1,
1969 and March 31,1970.

throughout the evening.

After the banquet spread, there
will be an evening of dancing to
the music of Paul Lee and The
Walkers. This soul group, from
the Plattsburgh area, is making its
Albany area debut at the dance.

The admission price, $5.00‘per
couple with student tax ‘ and
$10.00 without tax, includes all
aspects of the evening except the
cash bur service; that is, the dinner
for two and an evening of dancing
in a relaxed atmosphere. It also
includes a ride to the wassail party
on the sleigh service Friday night.

Winteriude tickets are available
in the Campus Center lobby,
today through Friday, from 10
a.m. till 3 p.m.

Friday night, the Campus
Center Governing Board and
Special Events Board are
cooperating to bring a different
sort of entertainmnet to the
University. A wassail party in the
true tradition of the occasion.

Starting at eight o'clock in the
main cafeteria of the Campus
Center, there will be the party
itself. It will run until midnight.

This truly novel event is further
enhanced by the transportation
which will be available to the
participants; sleighs.

Predicated on the presence of
snow on the ground, a series of
sleigh rides is planned around the
perimeter road. The sleighs will
stop at each quad to pick up the
celebrants, and then drop them at
the rear entrance of the Campus
Center.

The sleigh ride is free to those

Others will be obliged to pay $.50

Board Applications Open

Applications are now open for
a position on the Campus Center
Governing Board. The Board has
recently become a constituted
group under the auspicies of the
Commission for Community
Programming. The Commission
established the Board over a year
ago as an extension of itself to
fulfill the responsibilities accepted
by the Commission for the use,
operation, and development of
the Campus Center.

In only a year's time, the
Governing Board has involved
itself with many aspects
concerning the use of the Center.
Last semester it began the Coffee
House Circuit and is now working
to expand this concept to include
student talent from this school as
well as others.

In the area of art coordination
for the Center, the Board has been
sucessful in recommending the

purchase of various prints and
paintings, as well at: directing the
use of the second floor art gallery
for exhibits and sales.

The Governing Board is
concerned with the evaluation oi
the present facilities of the
Center, and requests changes
when it is felt they are needed.

The reVdccorution of the
Rathskellar is evidence of this
role.

Presently the Board is
considering the allocation of space
on the third floor of the Center to
Student Association groups, as the
Music department will be moving
out of these third floor offices
sometime next semesten

The Board is now looking into
conducting a used book sale in the
Campus Centerlfor next semester,
whereby a student would be able
to set a price on. his used books
and give themrto the Board to sell

In keeping with the season, the
Governing Board is sponsoring a
pottery sale tomorrow and
Thursday which will allow
students and faculty to do some
of their Christmas shopping in the

Center. On Friday, December 13,
the Board will be sponsoring a
