When a history major is unable to be signed into
a course in American Foreign Policy because he
registered on the ﬁfth day of registration; when a
major is closed out of four out of four sociology
courses; when an Art major plans on ﬁve Art courses
and ends up with one—then something is deﬁnitely
wrong with the system of preregistration at this

University.

In an attempt to eliminate huge lines and cutthroat
competition. the Administration has settled on the
preregistration policy known as
alphabet" system. This policy, whether one likes it or
not, has evidently been received with favor by the
Administration, and will, as far as can be seen,

continue.

As long as we have this system, it makes sense to
attempt to make it a more equitable one. As it is set
up now, majors are ﬁnding it increasingly difﬁcult to
attain the courses they want—at any time, with any

prof.

The method must be changed if a student is
expected to plan his academic career intelligently.

The one area in which a students should be allowed
to study what he chooses (with proper advisement) is
his major. It is, by his OWn admission, his area of
greatest interest—or at least the area he intends to

concentrate on.

Presently, sophomores must declare their major at
the end of their Spring term. As the system stands
today, in some cases, the sophomore has not been able
to take more than one course in his proposed major
ﬁeld by the time he is supposed to make a decision.

exposure to it, is a mystery. By allowing non-majors
to enter upper level courses before a proposed major
you may deny him the opportunity of making a
decision based upon sufﬁcient facts.

The major may also be forced, at times, to make up
for his inability to get into his desired course in one
term by taking an overloaded schedule consisting of 8
out of 10 courses in his major ﬁeld, in one year. This,
too, makes little sense. Being forced to cram all those
credits in one area into one year negates the purpose

I he true reasoning behind all of this boils down to
a basic right that the student should have: the right to
specialize, at the rate one sees ﬁt, in his respective

This is not to discourage a broadening of horizons.
All students should take more than simply their major
and minor courses: and by virtue of University
standards, they do.

Well then, how do we solve this problem? First,
after four weeks of classes, each student will be
required to visit his advisor and give her the list of
courses he wishes to take. After an appointed period
of time, all of these forms are submitted to those who
create the schedule—and they can plan the allotment
of the classes with the number of students wanting to
be admitted to each in mind. This system was
instituted on a small scale this term. It should become
completely effective next term.

Next step: require every student to declare a major
or tentative major—and place it on his brown striped
card to insure one major for each student. Then, after

Closed

Courses

the schedule of classes for the next term has been
carefully planned, give each Department head all of
the cards ~for that department. Then, using the same
alphabetical system we have today, have all
majors—and maj0rs only—draw their cards in their
respective ﬁelds.

After the majors have been given their opportunity,
throw open the remaining courses to the entire
University community.

How will all this beneﬁt the student? Under this
system, there will be an opportunity for a student to
decide upon a major in a more rational manner.
Majors will be able to attain the classes they want
(without having to either go through the trouble of
getting signed in). YET, students need not be
restricted from experimenting in courses aside from
their major.

The courses will be planned around the student‘s
desires—instead of the student planning his courses

around the chance of the schedule. A sane rate of
study in a ﬁeld will be a viable possibility for all
students. The students will gain.

There may be drawbacks to this system—we have
yet to discover a system without one. However, the
advantages seem to be there for the entire University
community, expecially those students majoring in
humanities or social sciences. This plan then has been
attempted on a small scale within departments here
for juniors and seniors. It has worked in places such as
Cornell. It seems to promote rationality and alleviate
injustice—a pretty fair accomplishment for a
registration system. Now, if we can work on our
government . . .

 

Comm unications

[SECT Responds

To the Editor:

As a result of the very
successful sale (1250 copies) of
the first Student Evaluation of
Courses and Teachers (SECT)
publication which began Nov. 4
many queries and criticisms have
been directed to us concerning the
publication and the procedual
methods used by the SECT
committee. We would like to
clarify some points by responding
to the comments which we have
been receiving.

First question: “Why so few
courses and so few teachers in the
publication?" Answer: A
voluntary student group must
limit the scope of evaluations in
order to do a thorough, efficient
job. We therefore selected
introductory courses and courses
that have no prerequisite as a large
sample of courses to be evaluated
which affect many students. Why,
then, was not every such course
evaluated? The answer to this
question lies in the muthod We use
to secure faculty participation:
teachers have a choice as to
whether they wish to participate
or not. Our reasons for offering
this choice are:

One, in order to obtain large,
representative numbers of student
response, we distribute the
questionnaire through the
eta-00m making use of class
time. We feel that It ll right that
we secure the teacher’s "okay"
before we take time to distribute
materials in his class. This method
assures us of large samplings since
the questionnaires are collected
immediately.

Two, we believe that, ideally,
faculty should not be forced to

participate in this type of
evaluation, but rather should
desire to co-operate in our goal of
improving instruction. If we feel
that the faculty’s co-operation
does not increase significantly,
and that our goal of improving
instruction is hindered by this
lack of co-operation, we will seek
alternate methods for the
distribution and collection of the
questionnaire.

A second criticism we have
been receiving is that the
publication seems too
complimentary. If you believe this
is so, a possible explanation rests
with the people who were
evaluated and the people who did
the evaluating. Since faculty
participation is optional, we may
guess that self-confident and
risk-taking teachers gambled with
us on our first venture into
student evaluation. We thank
them for taking a chance into this
unknown territory. As for those
who did the evaluating, We feel
that the students may have been a
little generous in their ratings of
courses and teachers. By using an
anonymous questionnaire we can
only assume that the students will
respond honestly. In addition, we
pose the possibility that perhaps
some of the teachers who were
evaluated actually are good
teachers.

The form of the publication has
been both praised and criticized.

We employ such an objective
format to allow for individual
interpretation by the reader. We
prefer not to make value
judgments as to what elements of
teaching are good or bad, but
rather tr. state the facts and
figures of student opinion and to
leave the judgments to the student

,,.,tvr.‘,gs.uewr.tav . » r.

 

i

who is interested in finding out
something about a course and its
instructor. or to the teacher who
is interested in student feedback.

Another area which needs.
clarification is the questionnaire
itself. Through experience we
have already learned that certain
items should be added and some
should be eliminated from the
ﬁrst questionnaire. The second
questionnaire has such revisions
and we expect that it will be
improved each semester. Students-
of the SEC’I‘ committee and
several faculty members have
voluntarily devoted substantial
time to devise, study and revise
the questions.

This week, the new
questionnaires are being given out
by SECT representatives. We urge
you, the students, to respond
honestly to the questions. If you
learn that one of your teachers is
not participating in the new
evaluation and could be, confront
him with your feelings. Nothing
can be accomplished if all parties
remain silent, so ﬁnd out why
your teacher has decided not to
participate.

Following the procedure used
last semester, the data from this
evaluation will be compiled by the
Computer Center. Results will be
translated into a meaningful
booklet and will be available next
March in time for Fall '69
pro-registration. At this time we
would like to thank all students,
faculty. and administrators who
supported and continue to
support the goals of BECT.

On The Other Hand

by Tom Ceramic and Doug Goldsclunidt

 

 

The Way It lie “’33....

 

Every folk culture has its
popular myths, and Albany State
is no exception. The Slavs had
Count Dracula, and we have the
FSA. Some of the parts of this
myth hold that FSA is bleeding
the students dry, and that it
makes fantastic profits which are
spent on orgies at the end of each
year.

However, like most myths only
half of this is true—FSA does not
bleed us dry, but you should see
the orgies. Like most myths, upon
examination this one becomes a
dried up old bat lying in a coffin
with a stake in its heart.

Seriously, FSA is a non-profit
service corporation founded in
1951 which contracts with the
State of New York. FSA runs
Food Service, the bookstore, the
barber shop, the billiards hall, tlle
bowling alley, check cashing,
short-term loans, the vending
machines, the washing machines,
and the auditing of Student
Association‘s books.

The bookstore has shared the
bulk of FSA’s problems and of
the student's rath. To most
students it seems logical that they
should be making large profits,
but remarkably enough they have
been running in the red. (In fact
FSA as a whole last ﬁscal year had
only $25,000 in profits out of
$34 million in sales, and this
$25,000 does not include
depreciation costs.)

After a talk with the head of
FSA, the reasons for this
remarkable occurence are still not
quite clear. Some of the many
reasons offered are that the
bookstore has moved twice since
June, 1966 (from Draper to the
library basement to the present
location), that for many months
last year and this year the store
has been without a manager, the
cost of expanding bookstore
activities, and shoplifting.

We can certainly understand
how these reasons would cost
money, but they still do not
explain why the bookstore is not
showing more than a marginal

 

profit this year. As as far as
shoplifting goes, no one in F‘SA
knows how much of the loss is
due to shoplifting or even how
much there is because there was
no inventory taken last year.

As to the criticism of the
inadequate service during the
bookrush, the reasons FSA offers
are that they handled 118,000
volumes this fall by hand and
cannot over-order as it costs too
much money to return books to
the company; also they cannot
sink all of their money into an
idle invontory. Thus if a professor
underorders, changes his mind, if
there is a last minute change in
faculty, or if there is an
unexpected over-enrollment in a
course there will not be enough

35’?!”

books on hand. This fall out of
2,327 titles, 12 to 15 were
mic-ordered. No figures were given
as to how many books were
under-ordered.

You will be happy to know
that the bookstore will probably
run into the black this year and
discounts and reductions are being
planned for the near future. Since
FSA admitted that they do not
really know what they will do to
solve their problems when they
ﬁnd out what their problems are,
it would be appreciated if you
send any suggestions you may
have to the ASP ofﬁce.

At any rate Doug thought
Kaleidoscope was nice, but Tom
thought it could be summed up in
one word—nausea.

Why am I here? Why do Ilivc?

To make ﬁfty thousand dollars
a year. Sounds like a foolish
answer. If it‘s yours, you don't
have to hide your humanity
because you don't have any. To
place money as your ultimate
value is to be as shallow as Lake
Chad during the dry season.

To teach others, to help others.
This is the best answer man can
give, and it too is faulty. To teach
others what? Your values? Who
needs them? Not me or anyone
else.

To help others to do what? Be
like you? Yes, and all of our
philanthropies, public and private,
are geared to this selfish end.

We teach others less
intelligent and less fortunate

Besides the fact that the Paris
peacemakers may settle the
Vietnam question, the Americans
there are also going to be forced
to examine their ideological
predilections about so-called
Asian Communism.

This examination is going to be
forced by the very nature of the
Vietnam problem in its larger
aspects. Fundamentally, the
question is going to be this: Is the
United States ready to alter its
perceptions and prescriptions
about Southeast Asia and Asian
Communism, as it has in some
sense done with Russia and
European Communism?

A brief historical review can
crystallize the problem here. In
the early 1950’s, the US.
considered Communism as both
an evil and immoral ideology, and
as a militarily expansionistic
threat.

The intense responses to the
post-W.W. II Communist
movement was personified on the
foreign policy level in diplomat

eorge F. Kennan who
formulated the containment
policy; and in Senator Joseph
McCarthy who purged the
domestic front of its Communist
witches.

Kennan and the foreign policy
experts put the containment
policy into practice. Europe was
to be protected by NATO and
strengthened by the Marshall Plan.
In Southeast Asia, as a protection
against the evil, the “Asian Arc”
of military defense bases sprung
up, ringing China and the Pacific
from Japan and South Korea, to
the Ryukyus Islands and Tawain,
to the Philippines and, in 1954,
the Indo—China pennisula.

Since the 50’s, however, there
have been attempts at
disengagement, at peaceful
coexistence. Monolithic
Communism with the capital “C,”
has been replaced by the small
“c” of polycentric communism.
But—and here is the
problem—most of these
movements away from 1950
ideology has been intended for,

Communications

and accrued' to, U.S.-Soviet
relations.

This has not been the case, at
least to the same degree, with
U.S.-Chinese relations. Here the
adversary—China and Asian
Communism—is still largely
painted in the colors OS 1950
prejudices. Here is wherevfhe US.
has pushed containment to the
utmost; where China is kept out
of the United Nations; where
Japan is alienated by US.
insistence on retaining defense
bases; where 1968 Vietnam
rhetoric sounds much like a replay
of 1950 Korean rhetoric.

So the larger issue at Paris will
be a psychological one for the
Americans, and not merely an
answer to external relations
between the US. and the two
Vietnams.

It is going to be an internal
confrontation between 1950
American ideology about China
and Asian Communism, and 1968
realities. The outcome will be not
or v interesting, but also of the
utmost importance.

With anticipated incresed
co-opcration from all involved, we
hope to expand the scope of
evaluations for the future. We are
well aware that upper-level
courses and their teachers should
have the benefit of student
evaluation. Since it is an
immedltatc goal, we would like to
stress the importance of
interuction NOW between
students and faculty in the area of
improving instruction. After all,
of what use to the instructor or
the student is the statement which
indicates that the teacher does not
communicate well, or that his
exams are unfair? We maintain
that those are of little value unless
students criticize constructively.
Interaction, that is, direct
discussion between faculty and
students, is necessary for the
improvement of instruction.

To the Editor:
RE: "Concert

Michael H. Sturk's letter rocks

Complaints"

‘  

Sophomore, he and those who
think like him on certain points
regarding concerts should have
learned that what is right or fair is
not always accomplished. I fully
agree that paying Sid-ll) for tickets
is “not right," but if it is the price
one must pay for owl's own
shortsightedncss and laziness irl
purchasing tickets early, then
that's the scalping business.

Yet there are vulid complaints
in Stark’s letter which do deserve
answers. Firstly, I agree that the
gym is a lousy place for concerts
and that the P. A. system is poor.
Having tried our best in the past
and still had faulty sound, we are
having an acoustics company
study the gym rr;.d present us with
an estimate for a complete sound
system which will at best givo us
maximum quality sound III a
lousy gym. As for the specific
breakdown during the Collins
Concert, her road manager,
Arturo, must take full blame, as it
was he who most "knowledgably"
stuck a screwdriver in a rented
amplifier resulting in no sound
and a blown ampliﬁer.

Secondly, as for ticket sales on
and off campus, let me remind
Stark who hasn’t been here long
enough to know or had the drive
to fir... at that every concert in
the last three years has offered
some off campus tickets for

.  :memxmw.w~_ﬂ__

outsiders as a means to help make
up for some of the losses incurred.

And since no concert in the last
three years up until the
Collins-Union Gap Concert has
ever sold out, we had no reason to
doubt our past experiences with
ticket sales and assume that we
could or would sell out on
campus. In case anyone is
interested in the facts, out of
3000 total tickets, only 74 were
sold at Van Curler’s and only 93
were sold at Sear's. End to
contrary rumors!

In addition, when Isaw that we
would sell out on campus,
immediately stopped all outside
sales and called back the extra
tickets to be made available for
students. Since I agree with the
idea of preference to students, for
I am a student, we are working on
a plan to release extra tickets for
the public a few days before our
concerts. But it doesn't take long
to realize that if a shortsighted
student waits until just before the
concert to buy tickets only to
ﬁnd the event sold out, he would
probably Write a letter much like
the one in last week’s ASP.

All of this “ ' ' "

have 10,000 tax paying students
who wish to attend concerts that
can only seat 3,000 people.

Now Mr. Stark, you see that
this too is unfair, but are you
willing to put up action, petitions,
etc., or shut up after making valid
complaints and receiving equally
valid explanations, neither of
which will solve the problem.

Thank you,

THE RED HAG

(measured by our standards)
exactly how to imitate us. We try
to create carbon copies which are
worthless.

In the 19th century, a major
reason for Manifest Destiny, our
entrance into lands where we
didn’t belong, was that we were
obliged, even destined to bring
our superior system of
government to other parts of the
world, so the people in these areas
could be free.

Today we do the same thing.
perhaps with a little more
sophistication. The socialists
preach that only under their form
of politicalidiocy can man be free.
The capitalists of the so-called
Free World say that only through
their money-hungry, laissez-faire
economic system can the
individual be free

This is insanity. By telling
people the only means in which
they can attain freedom, we are,

" in effect, limiting their liberty.

I hate dedicated people.
Dedication causes a blindness
which man is doomed to accept.
And what causes dedication? That
same commodity which motivates
our political aspirations and
ideals—hate.

We become so blind that we
hate all other ideals, and
eventually the people who
expound them. George Wallace
hated niggers (said without
contempt, for white idiots
outnumber black idiots in the
United States 10 to 1), Nixon
hated communists, and Humphrey
hated people who hated, the
bigots, which includes just about
everyone.

In fact, without hate, there‘d
be no government. Then perhaps
we could be free. But people hate
crime, hate our "enemies," hate
poverty, three qualities brought
about by hating one another.
Hence government.

Why am lhere?

Suieas hell not to do anything
to others, and by doing things
for them, I do things to them,
some good, some detrimental.
Should I stop teaching? No. But I
must limit myself, if I do freely
choose to help (which I do), in
only offering the assistance the
other party wants, not be offering
what I think the other party
wants.

Then answer: why am I here?

To be myself in me. To live,
not to exist. To choose to love,
but to be free to choose to hate,
although it denies life.

To be free from the grips of
others. To want them to be free
from me. What do I want?

Aristotle called it straight:
happiness. What is it? I don't
know. But I’m going to do my
dumncdest to find out. I may
never find it. In fact, I know I
won't. But thatiswhy I’m here:
to look. And as always, I can't
stand it!
