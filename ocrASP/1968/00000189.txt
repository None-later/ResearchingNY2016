AFL’s Bills Will
Draft 0. J. Simpson

BUFFALO. NY. UPI—Ralph
C. Wilson, Jr. abruptly breaking
his curious silence over college
football's most sought after
player, said Monday the Buffalo
Bills would probably reach for O.
J. Simpson in next month's
professional draft.

The Bills‘ owner said in a brief
statement he was embarrassed by
the 1-12-1 record that gave
Buffalo professional football’s
worst record and the right to
negotiate with Simpson. He said
no one player could compensate
for the Bills' showing in 1968.

We have not made a final
decision nor will we until all the
college bowl games are over,"
Wilson said. But Simpson is the
most exciting college player to
come along in many, many
seasons and the way it looks right
now we will probably draft him.

Wilson previously had been
silent in regards to Simpson, the
Heisman Trophy winner from
Southern Cal. But his head coach,
Harvey Johnson, was lavish in his
praise of the nation's top running
book.

i just can't conceive of any
team not taking him, Johnson said
after the Bills were assurred of the
top choice in the Jan. 28 draft.

He’s a great runner, that‘s all
there is to it, Johnson said.

Get him and you play him to
run with the football.

it certainly is nice to be in a
position where you know you can
get Simpson if you want him. i
think he's one of the most
outstanding college players
developed in reCent years and he's
a terrific running back, Johnson
said.

Rocky Beats Pat

ALBANY, NY. (UPl)—-ln one
of the closests election battles
in New York State history, Gov-
ernor Rockefeller topped come-
dian Pat Pauisen by seven votes
in the unofficial results of the
write-in vote for president in the
November election.

The official tally of state votes
however showed that the ov-
ernor and the comedian ran a
poor second aan third to Sen.
Eugene McCarthy.

’i‘he incomplete and totally an-
official results released by the
New York secretary of state's
office gave McCarthy III-I votes,
Rockefeller hi and Watson -17
votes in the write-in contest.

The Bills coach traveled to Los
Angeles last week to watch
Simpson play when USC faced
Notre Dame.

Under professional football
regulations the team with the
worst record in both the AFL and
NFL is first to choose in the draft.

Buffalo with its 1-12-1 record
was guaranteed first pick in the
college draft Sundiiy when the
National Football League
Philadelphia Eagles downed the
New Orleans Saints 29-17. The
win made their record 2-11-0,
with a final game yet to be
played.

Buffalo, plagued by injuries
throughout the season, went
through five quarterbacks. The
team ended its year Saturday in
Houston bowing to the Oilers
35-6.

Dane Hoopstcrs Win First
Defeat Stony Brook 57-52

The Albany State basketball
squad registered its first win this
past Saturday as they defeated the
Stony Brook Patriots by a score
of 57-52.

Albany was led in scoring by
Rich Margison who tallied
twenty-one points for the night.
in amassing his total, Margison hit
six field goals and nine foul shots.

The Great Danes led at half by
a score of 28-20 as Margison
poured in fourteen points.

The Patriots, however, began to
close the gap in the second half as
closed within three points behind
the hot shooting of Mark
Kirschner. Jack Adams sealed the
game, however, when he sank two
free throws with just three
seconds left in the ball game.

Following Margison in the
scoring for Albany were Jack
Adams with eleven points and Jim
Caveriy with ten. Caveriy also led
the team in rebounds as be
gathered in nine.

Scott Price, who has been
bothered by a bad ankle, grabbed
severn rebounds.

The Danes, who were hurt by
too many fouls in their opening
season loss also lost two

balipiayers foul out in this game
as Price and Jack Jordan both
committed five fouls.

With Price unable to perform at
peak efficiency, the Great Danes
are at a deﬁnite loss for depth.
Last year, Price was the leading
rebounder for the squad and
played at all times except when he
was in foul trouble.

This year, however, the team
has been forced to rely on Jack
Duffy to supply the rebounding
and center the offense. While
Duffy is not a poor player, he
lacks both the rebounding ability
and the scoring potential of Price.

Alden III, the sevensome was
victorious in two oat of two
games, thus taking their second
trophy.

in other games: the playoff for

Schuyler Hall victorious over

league second place holders,
Schuyler won again. this time over

Dorms and sororities should
now be thinking about forming

W.R.A. would like to extend its
thanks to all those members

officiating volleyball intramurals.
Special thanks arc directed to
Mary Ann Zahurak, volleyball
manager and coordinator for the
time and effort she spent in
effectively organizing and running
the program.

Plattsburgh tonight to attempt to
gain their second victory of the
season. Last year, in a high scoring
game, Albany defeated the
Plattsburgh Cardinals by eight
points, 96-88. The Danes need
this victory as they are facing the
State University of Buffalo this
Saturday.

Buffalo has a strong team this
year and boast height which will
put all but impossible pressure on
Albany‘s front court. The Bulls
have a 6'9" center who will
supply the Albany big men with
some tough competition under
the boards.

With only two men over 6‘2",
Albany cannot be expected to win
the ballgame, but with a fine team
effort they may be able to present
at least a representative showing.

The game against Buffalo is the
last home game for the team
before the Christmas vacation.

On the following Wednesday,
the Varsity Hoopsters travel to
Central Connecticut State. Central
Connecticut leads in the series
with Albany, having won thirteen
of the twenty-one games over the
years.

During the vacation period, the
Danes will host the Capitol City
Tournament on December 27-28.
The field includes Siena College,
University. and
Hamilton College.

Following New Year's, the
Danes swing back into action ill
Merrimack College on January 6.
Their next home game will be on
Saturday, January 11, against
Harpur and the following
Saturday against Pratt institute.

Sexuality In The Framework

Of Today’s Society Viewed

“I am not an cxpcrl in this

graduate of Vassar and llic
University of Rochesicr Medical
School She also holds a :Icgrcr-
from Columbia Uiiivcrsliy. "’I'hero
arc no cxpcrls."

(‘alderonc stated her purpose
and that of SIECUS “is not sex
education of the very young, our
primary purpose is sex education
aimed at the adull community."
Such information wculd guidi-
“lhc individual and his or her
sexuality in the frame-work of
today's socliely."

“Sex l'tlllCilIIUll begins at the
moment of birlh and conlinucs
throughout life," emphasized
Calderonc. What is tauglil in
schools under the tillc of sex
cducalion is reproduction which is
llic rcsuil of scx. Sex criucalion
must be vii-\Vcd in tcrms ol'scxual
intercourse

“’l‘hcrc are many ways of
expressing sexuality," rcnuii‘kcd
('aldi-runc. "i‘Izii‘h cullurc has its
own :iccnplcd slniidards of
inalcncss and fcmalcncss.” In our
soon-1y, she noted, we havrI
subslilulcd l'cminily and
niasculiiiily, superficial aspects of
sexuality, which have placed the
sexual acl on a superficial level.
Sexuality in lcrnis of “how men
and women relate to each olhcr,
how they haVc reacted to life
experiences" also plays a rule in
the scx acl.

Many people use sex against
each olhcr in an exploitative
manner inside or outside of
marriagc according to Caiderone.
Some use sex “to gel somethin

like a reward," she enumerated,
“or as a status symbol, to prove
their independence, to comfort
themselves wilh; to punish
someone, emotional blackmail; or
jusi 1o pass time."

in Dr. (.‘alderonc‘s opinion sex
is a means for two people to relate
to each olhcr iii lolal intimacy in
order Ill deepen their relationship.
