Hebrew Language Class
May Be Realized Soon

Over 50 students have
expressed an interest. in starting
Hebrew courses on campus next
semester. Because of the lateness
of the request, there is no
possibility of offering such a
course as a regular part of our
curriculum in the spring.

There is a possibility that the
course will be approved and
offered next fall through one of
the departments of the Division of
Humanities.

Throuin constant consultation
with Dean Perlmutter's office,
Hillel has been advised to
organize an informal course
during the second semester with
the possibility for obtaining credit
open.

Although the University would,
in no way, be involved in offering
the courses in the spring semester,
students might still be eligible for
obtaining credit after the course
has been given. An examination

Curriculum Change Reports

by Kathy Reilly

An open meeting to discuss the
reports from four task forces
concerning curriculum changes
will be held in the Campus Center
ballroom on Monday, December
16, 1968, at 8 pm.

The task forces, composed of
students and faculty members, are
each concerned with‘a specific
area. The four committees are
studying the academic calendar,
departmental regulations,
instruction, and an experimental
college.

All interested students and
faculty members are invited to
attend. It is hoped that those
participating in the meeting will
contribute their opinions, ask
questions and discuss the
problems of implementing the
committee's findings in the
University.

Since October, the committtees
preparing reports based on their
research; these will be presented
on Monday night.

Chairman of the meeting will
be Dr. Allan Kuusisto, the
Vice-President for Academic
Affairs. Also present will be at
least two special guests,
authorities in certain fields which
were studied by the task forces,
Dr. Franklin Patterson and Dr.
Harlan D. Hansen.

Hansen is associated with the
College Entrance Examination
Board, and is the director of the
Four-Schools Study. President of
Hampshire College in Amherst,
assachusettes, a new, progressive
college, Patterson is a co-author of
"Making of a College--P1ans for a
New Departure in Higher
Education." He is primarily
concerned with creating a
cprriculum which combines a
liberal education with
Independent study.

Dr. Arthur Collins, chairman of
the Academic Calendar
committee, commented that the
reports urge more ﬂexibility than
in the present curriculum

Discussion

Although some of the revisions
could be implemented by next
semester, any major changes
would not be effected until at
least next fall.

Probes Policy Check

by Barry Kirschner
Staff Reporter

“How much control should the
executive branch have over
foreign policy?” This was the
topic open to a group discussion,
sponsored by the Forensics Union
(Debate Council) Tuesday, Dec.
10.

The purpose of the event was
to demonstrate the difference
between group discussion and
debate. This difference was
specified by Sandra Fish of the
Speech Department who
explained that the purpose of
debate is to persuade, while group
discussion is useful in gathering
information.

The discussion was conducted

'by six members of Mrs. Fish’s

Speech 104 class. Much of the
audience of about 200 came
because of the strong
recommendation of many of the
Speech Department Faculty.

The analysis of the topic
included a broad history of
executive control of foreign,
policy, and possible changes
which might be made to curtail
the power of the president. Ar.
emphasis was place on the
evolution of the U.S. from an

isolationist nation to a world
power and the necessary
adjustments.

Birth Control Reformer
May Face Prison Sentence

BOSTON MIPS)" Bill Baird,
who two years ago set out to
deliberately challenge
Massachuseth state laws against
birth control, is almost at the end
of the llllt‘ this week in his fight
against a possible ten-year prison
sentence.

The Massachusetts Supreme
Court is hearing his case this
week. It is not highly probable
that the state’s highest juoicial
bench Will look kindly on a man
who called it hypocritical and
then pioved it.

His two-year fight has been one
against hypocrisy. Two years ago
Baird was invited to lloston
University by the NEWS, its
students newspaper, to lecture on
birth control and give out
contraceptive devices. lle lectured
to an audience of more than
2,500 people, and displayed and
explained the various methods of
birth control.

He was immediately arrested
(and subsequently convicted] on
two counts that allegedly violate
the stnte's provisions for “crimes
against chastity." Each of them
carries a iiaximum sentence of
five years in prison.

The 100-year-old law, entitled
“Crimes Against Chastity,"
forbids the unmarried any :it‘cess

UNIVERSITY BEGINS 125TH YEAR

by Linda Staszak

A bill was passed by the legislature on May 7, 1844
establishing a normal school in the county of Albany. The
school opened on December 18 with David Perkins Page as

the first principal.

Twenty~ninc pupils attended the school which was
located in a depot building vacated by the Mohawk and
Hudson Railroad Company. The building contained two
study rooms, four recitation rooms. a lecture room and

library.

During the early history the number of students was
limited to two from each assembly district. There were no
scholastic requirements for admission not even graduation

from a district school.

The object of the institution was the instruction of
teachers ofcominon schools in the science ofcducation and
the art of teaching. The curriculum was limited to common
school subjects and pedagogy. Instruction was chiefly
academic and teachers were chosen for their superiority at
scholars. The statute authorizing the establishment of the
school forbade the study of any subjects not hearing
dircclly on the science and art o1 teaching.

The course could be completed in two terms. Graduation
was upon recommendation of the l’iincipal and faculty
based on moral character and literary attainments i'allici
than length of attendance. Thcic was no standard of
attainment other then the judgment of the faculty. liiicli
student was l’l‘qlllfCLl to sign a pledge that he would teach in

the district schools of the stale.

The first class consisting of five women and 2‘) men was
graduated in August. 1845. By 1848 cnrollmcnl numbered
250. 'A new law permanently established the school and
appropriated $15,000 fora new building which was locatcd
at the corner of Lodge and Howard Streets.

As First

The emergence ol a student
government at UK? University became
appaicnl in March of 1017 when a
Student Council, known as
MYSKANIA, was selected by a faculty
committee.

In 1917, MYSKANIA, an honorary
body composed of seniors appointed in
their junior year, was the student
government. and as one of its original
purposes, governed all student activities
other than athletics. as well as writing a
constitution for the siiidcnl body.

MYSKANIA instituted weekly
assemblies, mandatory for every sludenl
til the college.

In 1021. llic \Iudcnis of the college
voted to have a student organization
with officms clcctcd 111 the spiing ml

vested all judicial power of tilt:
Assoclaﬂon in MYSKANIA, all
executive power in Student council. and
all legislative power in the assembly of
the Association.

The Constitution also defined
MYSKANIA's duties more fully,
including the following: to organize the

The administration ofWilliain J. Milne brought a marked
change to the character of the school. By 1890 there were
3,000 graduates and 7,000 other students who had gone on
to bc teachers. Conditions of admission were so low that a
large part of the time was spent teaching subjects usually
taught in academics and high schools. Since the normal
school course was too short to provide mastery of both
subject matter and methods it was decided to demand

rivalry, to uphold college traditions, to
supervise SA. and class elections, and to
act as interpreter of the constitution.
The war-torn forties brought new
changes to the student government. A
icviScd constitution was drawn up in
1945, in which each class would have
four Student Council representatives. II
also included the controversial clause
which stated that MYSKANIA Would
no longcr be self-perpetuating, but
would be elected by the students.
During the caily ﬁfties, the
enrollment in the college more than

mastery of high school subjects before entrance. The
concentration would then be on complete and practical
professional tiaining.

On March 13, 1890, the Regents oftlie University oftlie
State of New York authorized certain changes in the
structure of the school. The name of the school was
changed to the New York State Normal College. Instruction
was restricted to methods, school economy, philosophy,
and history of education and other subjects directly related
to the science and art of teaching. Also the college was
granted the authority to confer the degree of bachelor of
pedagogy on persons completing the course of study. The
college now had a strictly professional character.

Training of primary teachers continued to be the chief
business of the school until 1906. The school differed from
lllt‘ ten other normal schools in the state in that it was the
only one that gave instruction in professional subjects only.

The emphasis was on teaching rather than scholarship.
Di. Milnc felt thal pedagogy was superior to subject matter
in the prejuiration of teachers. lie is quoted as saying: “You
high school teachers need iiol know much chemistry: if you
only know the methods of teaching chemistry you will get
along crcililnblv."

In April. 1914. authority was granted to rename the
college lllt New York State College for Teachers. in 1931.
the (‘ollcgc was placed on the list of the Association of
American L'iiivcrsilics. It was the first teachers college to be
approved by the American Association of University
Women. but as a liberal arts college not a teachers college.

Several new buildings were begun in 1920. TliCSc
included Page hill and Milne High School. The
undergraduate qiion. was 1,200 in 1933 with 300 freshmen
being admitted annually. The great majmily if students
lived in private houses and boarding lzouscs until residenct’
halls for women were opened in 1935.

In 1938 a new policy of selective admissions was
instituted. Before September 1, 250 students with a
Regents average of 5.7% or higher were accepted. Then on
registration day 50 were admiiltd from the top of the list
of remaining candidates. In 1943, the entrance
requirements were liberalircd.

The Education Law. amended in 1948, established the
State University of New York and placed the
administration of the New York State College for Teachers
under the general dircclion of the trustees of the State

University. The final transfer of the College to the State
University became effective April 1, 1949. On September 1,
195‘), by act of the Trustees, the name of the college was
changed to the State University of New York College of
education at Albany. The name was Changed on October
16, 1961 to the State University College at Albany.

The full transition from Teachers College to University
took placc in 1062 when the present mime was given to the
new University Center, Stale University of New York at
Albany.
