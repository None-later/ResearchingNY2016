Danes Record “‘IJLAS'econd Win;
Defeat Plattsburgh 64 - 59

The Great Danes registered their second win of the season this past Tuesday when they defeated
Plattsburgh by a score of 64-59. This was the second win in a row for the Danes followmg their opening

season loss to Oneonta.

The high-scoring honors for the
game went to Rich Margiscn who
totaled tweiitycight points for
the night, twenty-two of which
came in the second half.

Margison, who shot ten for
Ieventeen from the field. was
followed in the scoring by Jack
Jordan with twelve points and
Jack Adam with ten.

In their first two games; the
Great Danes shot only 33% and
thus concentrated on ball control
and working for the good shot.
against Plattsburgh. The strategy
paid off as the lioupsters hit on
twenty-four of fifty-two shots.

Jack Duffy. who has been
seeing a lot of action this year
because of Scott Price‘s bad ankle
contributed eight points to the
team effort and was praised by
coach Doc Sauers for his fine
performance.

The Great Danes go against the
State University at Buffalo this
Satruday in quest of their third
straight win. Albany has never
beaten a team from Buffalo and
must be considered extreme
underdogs in this contest as
Buffalo lioasts a forecourt which
easily outdistunces the short
Albany team in height.

Last year. the Danes lost tc
Buffalo by a score of 92-69 their
biggest loss of the season.

Preceding the freshmen game
which will see the Albany squad
goagainst Buffalo's freshmen will
be a game between alumni from
the Albany area and alumni who
will be coming in from other
cities.

Freshman Hoopsters
Record First Victory

The successful coaching of Bob
Lewis paid off Tuesday night as
the Baby Danes registered their
first win against previously
undefeated Albany Pharmacy by a
score of 79-75.

After tiailing by a point at the
end of lhe first half. the frosli
came back to outscure their
opponents ifwltl in the second
half. The team was paced
offensively by John l-ieher who
tallied 28 points. In recording this

The presidents of the Student
Associations of the Universities
and Colleges of the State
University of New-York met with
Chancellor Gould December Sand
7 at the Rensselaerville's Institute
of Man and Science.

Economic opportunity
programs and race relations
problems were discussed with the
consensus agreeing that more
should be done within the state
system to allieviate inequalities.

On December 7. after
Chancellor Gould's announcement
of the room rate increase the
discussion centered around the
reasons for the increase.

These included increases in
construction costs, interest rates
rising iind greater operating costs.

According to Duncan Nixon,
President of the Student
Association of this University; the
increase should have been
distributed more evenly over the
last few years instead of a $170
uncrease in one year.

lie added that this was easy to
see in retrospect but that better
planning might have eliminated
the necessity for the sudden rise.

Nixon also said that an
additional reason for the higher
rate was that most of the present
housing is new and still being paid

The extra money accrued from
triple rooms will be used to
provide additional services
required by the extra students.
One of the topics discussed is
the future formation ofa Student
Information Center to provide
better information from the
Central Office to its students.
Another suggestion made at the
conference was the institution of
a state university newsletter to
provide s‘udents in the different

schools with a means of
communication similiir to the
present University Newsletter

which devotes splice to faculty
news.

The presidents of the
University Centers and the
presidents of these Student
Associations then met for
luncheon with Chancellor Gould
at his home.

The budget and giving the
student a voice in the formation
of the budget was discussed.
Presently at Buffalo students sit in
on budget hearings and can
comment if necessary.

Another outcome of these
meetings was the possibility of
having the agenda of the Board of
Trustees made available to
students and faculty before the
actual meeting.

by Tim Keeley
Staff Reporter

"We will close classes at noon
Wednesday." President Evan R.
Collins announced to a full house
at The President's Conference
with Students yesterday.

Students packed the Patrwn
Lounge as Collins explained that
the illness rate was remaining the
same and beginning to affect the
staff.

“In the interest of the health
and welfare of the students we
made the decision at noon
today," Collins remarked.

Dr. Clifton C. 'l‘horne,
ViCe-Presidcnt for Sttident
Affairs, informed students that
the residence halls will remain
open until Friday. “However.
regular Food ServiCe will not. be
operating."

Council in regards to residence
policies and athletics.

symposium is planned for April.

The work for the symposium is
supported by 0. William
Perlmutter. Dean. of the College of
Arts and Science. Interact. Forum

Center are working along with the
Committee.

Committee is invited to come to

In answer to a question of
authority. Collins noted the
legality of the University Council.

Under a piovision of the
Education Act the president is
responsible to the University
Council which is in turn
responsible to the Board of
Trustees which is in turn
responsible to the legislature and
the taxpayers.

A memorandum from
Chancellor Gould was also
presented by Collins which

elaborated on the increased room
rates for next year.

It was noted that the state
presently assumes about 30% of
the cost of each room. "The cost
of $550 compares favorably with
other colleges.” Collins noted.

The cost of triples would be
$120 per year. This means that
when there are five men in a :"our
man suite the cost of the suite
not the cost of the actual room
goes down. “This has not been
the case in the past," Collins
remarked.

'l‘horne noted
things are
consideration for
mentioned that the kind of
rooms and suite play an
important part. “We may ask
students if they want to triple
when they apply for next year’s
residence." Thornc commented.

In discussing the need for more
off-campus housing, Collins
stated that “We had a call last
Mondin evening from the
contractor saying that he was
bogged down with financing,
zoning. and other problems.

To compound the problem,
Collins noted that next week
500-600 students may be
displaced if the Mall project
comes up into the arcii where
they are now renting apartments.

In other business. a student
raised a complaint about“three
large dogs roaming in the Dutch
Quad dining hall and the snack
bar."

Collins came back with “This
campus was surely not designed
for dogs" which ended the
conference on a light note.
