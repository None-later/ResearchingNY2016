Debate Score
> e
Mediocre
by Barry Kirschner
Staff Reporter

Albany State novice debaters
produced a mediocre record at the
Iona College Debate Tournament
this past weekend.

The final results showed that
two out of four State teams had
won a majority of their events.

Thetoit'nament was for novice
debaters only.

The Forensics Union (Debate
Council) also sponsored a trip to
Stroudsburg State College
(Pennsylvania),for four speakers

participating in individual events. ‘

The results of this tournament are
not known as yet.

As has been the case for the

entire year, the teams defending
the negative side (status quo) of
the resolved, have been much
more successful than their
affirmative partners. The negative
team of Jay Zuckerman And Dave
Balinsky along with Pat Hanrahass
and John Bola were 5-1 and '4-2
respectively. The two affirniative
teams were each 1-5.

The results of this tournament
prove once more the difficulty
which affirmative debaters are
having in finding a plan which
would improve the status quo.

Membership status of the
Forensics Union has been recently
voted to the following: Eileen
Howe,Jan Anagnost, Jan Garvey,
Ellen Arshansky, Wendy Mathy,
Dave Balinsky, and John Bola.
Also inducted were: Robert
Burstein, Pat Henrahan, Barry
Kirschner, Mark Platt, Dz ve Small,
and Jeff Wasserman.

Tony Cantore was also elected
as publicity manager and member.

Central Council
F SA’s Top

by Don Stankavage

The current epidemic which is
sweeping the campus proved to be
a factor in the Central Council
Meeting, held last Thursday night.

The meeting was scheduled for
7:30 PM. It was called to order
without a quorum at 7:50. A
minimum quorum materialized
when Council member Barry Ross
arrived at 8:37.

At this Council meeting, top
administrative members of the
Faculty-Student Assosciation
were present to answer questions
concerning the organization and

Special Events Board
Applications Open

Special Events Board has
opened applications for
co-chairmanships of the events for
Fall Semester, 1960. This is a new
venture for the Board, since these
positions have never been filled
this early. However, it is the
feeling of the Board that the new
coAchairmcn should be chosen
now to afford them the maximum
time in organizing their events.

The successful Wintcrludc and
Holiday Sing this weekend closed
out the Board's activities for this
semester. The members of the
Board, through their Chairman.
Dan Logo, express their thanks to
the student body for the support
given these activities and are
optomistic about the ovonts
planned for next semester.

The positions now open are for
Full Concert, Activities Day,
Campus Chest, Homecoming, and
Holiday Sing.

Activities Day gives new]
students a chance to join some of
the many campus extra-curricular
activities and clubs. The Campus
Chest is a week long drive which
raises money for the United Fund

 

The applications are avaiuioie a.
the Campus Center Information
Desk and must be returned to the
Student Activities Office, room
364, as soon as possible.

Questions concerning ii'ia
applications or Special Events in

IT’s best to look at these
defeats in historical context. For
the first time since the student
movement lifted off eight years
ago, no off-campus issure is
clearly in focus. Student
involvement started with the
civil-rights movement in the early
1960's. It was relatively easy to
organize student militants against
racist grutality in the south.
Similarly the move to ban the
bomb and abolish the nee-fascist
House Un-american Activities
Committee were solid causes.

The war in Vietnam naturally
created a peace movement.
Student protests were crucial in
starting the wave of sentiment
that led to the Paris peacc talks
and the bombing halt. But now
that the anti-war movement has
subsided and the Presidential
elections are over, it is only
natural that students should turn

TUESDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1968

by Daryl Lynne Wager
Staff Reporter

In an attempt to show student
support of the long-dr-liuted
pass-fail system, a petition i- being
circulated among th' ..tudent
body that would hopefully
initiate faculty support of the
proposal.

Loretta Mcli, who is responsible
for starting the petition, reports
that student. reaction to the
movement has been good. Most
students, according to Miss Mcli,
are eager to sign the petition, and
many have volunteered to help
collect signatures.

The petition demands the
inauguration of a passfail
procedure for all courses; grading
would bc based on a system of
satisfactory (S) and unsatisfactory
(U), thus eliminating the presan
A, B, C, D, E.

Signcrs of the petition agree
that a pass-fail system would be
beneficial in that it would make
education “an active force."

  

Along with an increased desire to
learn, the student would
experience minimal competition
and the stimulation of his
creativity.

Dick Collier, chairman of the
Academic Affairs Commission,
emphasizes the limiting effects
placed on the student under the
present system. He feels that the
average student is afraid to
experiment with his subject
matter. Collier believes that the
inception of puss-fail would be the
best way to rid the University of
its old “'I‘eachcrs‘ College" image,
at the same time encouraging
stimulation of thinking through
such flexibilitics as independent
study.

Academic Affairs Commission,
of which Collier is chairman and

Miss Mcli a member, has
considered the proposal and
decided to present as their

minimum demand the initiation
of pass-fail with the freshman
class of September, 1969. This

Students Initiate
Black Art Program

by John O’Grady

“The Black Arts Movement is
radically opposed to any concept
of the artist that alienates him
from his community." This
statement by Larry Neal in “The
Drama Review" of New York
University refects a growing
attitude in contemporary theatre
that a large portion of reality,
namely, the black community in
America, has been left out of
American arts for a long period of
time.

A group of students from the
black community at Albany Stat:
University has been working for
the past two months to change
that situation. Their production
of Langston Hughcs'
"’I‘nmbourincs to Glory" will be
presented next February 12 in the
Campus Center, marking the
initiation of Black Theatre at thc
University.

Danny Barton, a sophomore at
the University and the director of
the play, appeared in ell-black
productions of “Macbeth,”
“Othello,” and “Julius Caesar"
while attending high school in.
Buffalo, and has worked on
children‘s theatre in his home
community; he spent last summer
studyir g at Lincoln Center.

He approached the
representatives of the Educational
Opportunity Program here early
in October with the idea of a
black theatre production, because
he felt that there were “very few

plays on campus geared toward
black talent"; on campus, as in
the entire ﬁeld of American
theatre, the black man has not
been given roles which he can
relate to. The Black Theatre
movement is essentially an
attempt to correct this problem of
white, middle—class dominance of
most American art forms, not by
“protest,” but by a positive
expression of another culture,
totally different but just as real in
America.

Langston Hughes, who died in
1967 and is often callcd the "poet
laureate of the black man," wrote
prolifically on the subject of life
in Harlem; his “Tambourines to
Glory" is a tale of religious vision
and corruption

The twenty or so studcnts
involved in the production
(including two whites who play
policemen) hav been devoting
upwards of ter. hours a week from
their schoolwork since
mid‘October in order to put
together an impressive
performance; although none of
the actors have ever been in plays
before, they are drawing from a
wide variety of other talents
(singing, modelling, public
speaking, dancing) to make
themselves effective in this first
effort. the lead players are Shirley
Cummings as Laura, Arlene Porter
as Essie, Michael Smith as the
Devil, and Connie Bryant as Birdie
Lee.

The opening of this all-student
production on February 12
coincides with the
commemoration of
Afro-American chk, a practice
which Mr. Barton himself
confesses he never paid sufficient
attention to until this year. In
terms of artistic worth and in
terms of social expression,
“'l‘ambourincs to Glory'I may
