Trimm Sentenced In Albany;

Evans Tums In Draft

by Perry Silverman

One pacifist sacriﬁced himself,
and another attempted to follow
him, at the Federal District Court
in Albany on January 20. Store
’I‘rimm was sentended to four
years imprisonment by District
Judge Foley after receiving a
lecture from the bench. 'l‘rimm
was convicted earlier of refusing
induction into the armed forces.

Foley scored his "nation-wide
career" of protest, and
condemned a “vocation involved
in protest." When discussing the

pacifist movement with ’I‘rimm.
Foley suggested that non-violent

movements were being inﬁltrated
by violent people.

Just before the sentence was
passed, 'I‘rimm’e supporters in the
visitor’s gallery rose as if to be
sentenced with him. The judge
said he would permit this, but no
other acts of protest would be
toleratEd.

After Judge Foley sentenced
the young pacifiest, his attorney,
Reverend Notegiore, stated that
an appeal would be made. Bail
was set at an unusually high
$5.000, twice the average amount.
Foley said that they sentence was
heavy-five years is the maximum
prison term-in order to set an

Continued from Page One
due to the urgency of the matter. He stated the faculty would be free
to repudiate him and the committments.

President Collins said the document of agreement between him and
the Black students does not allow them or any student power “to
determine course content, to control budget, to appoint faculty or to
establish a black department." They will be able to aid in planning for
the work in the department.

Item I of the document proposes a course on the 200 level to be
taught in Afro-American history. Item II proposes an "autonomous"
department of Afro-American studies. Black students could
recommend faculty for the department, and no one unacceptable to
them would be appointed. The appointment of faculty would go
through official channels.

Item III is a committment to admit 300 non-white minority
students next fall. This action would be in accordance with the
expected expansion of the Educational Opportunities Program.

Card

example for others who might try
to emulate ’I‘rimm.

Following the sentencing,
Richard Evans, a 21-year old
junior at Albany State went to the
U.S. District Attorney's office
where he attempted to turn in his
draft cards. Evans said he was
doing this because others could
not obtain conscientious
objector's status as he had.

He stated that “the law is
unjust so long as others are forced
to serve against their will." Evans
indicated that he would also leave
his dishwashing job at the LaSaIle
School. It is this- employment
which permits him to maintain his
draft status.

Evans entered the office of the
U.S. District Attorney on the
fourth floor and attempted to
leave his draft cards with the
secretary; she refused them. At
this time, U.S. Deputy Marshall
William Brinkman entered the
office. He, too, refused the draft
cards.

A scufﬂe ensued when Evans
place his draft cards on the

secretary’s desk. Brinkman
knocked over another
demonstrator who was

accompanying Evans in order to
put the cards back into his
pocket. Evans ﬁnally left the
office with the cards still in his
possession.

However, he walked down the
corridor to another office of the
U.S. District Attorney, dropped
his draft cards on the floor in
front of the entrance. and
departed from the building. They
are now in the possession of
federal officials.

With the advent of the report
on New Patterns - o‘f
Undue-dune Education have:
come numerous and I vital
action-oriented task forces whose
job it is to implement this report.

Along with two members of the
faculty of the University of
Chicago , SUNYA faculty
members were invited to discuss
the pros and cons concerning the
actualization of the experimental
or General College aspect of the
report.

They met in the informal and
uncomfortable Assembly Hall and

‘proceeded to de-construct the

conversation from dealing with
the General College to the
purpose of education.

Rhetoric was the only
semi-concrete result, although a
number of intellectuallysound
issues were approached.

‘ ’ partially 'On
the question of whether the
General College will be terminal,
an entity unto itself, or, will be
structured so as to relate to the

‘special' departments we now
have.
One point brought up in

conjunction with this question
was that the student must feel
satisfied, upon graduating from
the General College, that he has
the necessary (intellectual) tools
to survive in today’s high
expectation, achievement-oriented
society.

A point not discussed however,
was whether or not the moiety
and its values are admirable, that
is, are they values for which one
should strive?

Fred Childs, a member of the
task force on the experimental
college, indicated that it is the
intention of the task force and the
report that there shall be four or
five ways of completing an
education within the General
College.

Within this flexible structure,
there will be the opportunity for a
student to specialize he said.

It is this pluralistic structure
and adaptability to speicsl interest
that interested the members of
the University of Chicago.

Their experimental college
failed as a result of a dogmatic“,
one-tract program. They
applauded our University’s
recognition of the tension that
exists between generalized fields
(such as literature) and specialized
ﬁelds (such as mathematics.) .

In order to further thei
discussion along these lines, ag
definition of the educated man
and the goals of education was
called fore and given.

. “The, educated ("tng must have

some understahding of all 
areas 'of human gactlvities: he
ought to be able to understand
experts in all fields. These are-the

objectives of the "education .

process."

This definition combines both
the generalist and specialist
concepts of education, g

The definition led one student
(wonder how he found out about,
the meeting) to, question the
concern for moral relevance in the
education process.

From here the discussion was
hard to follow since references

were made back, forward, .
dropped,’picked-up and discarded
again.

Then the profound point was
made that if one cannot define
the objective of one's education,
one is getting a lousy education.

Going back to more relevancy
concerning the objectives of

“ “ , it was suggested that
the university should not ’be
considered an ivory tower,
although it does presume to serve
purposes not accomplished in
societ (the so-called ‘outeide
world') .

One interloper insinuated,
perhaps only as an aside, that the

university actually involve
students in relevant social
situation. (Heavens!) This

particular subject was not futther
discussed.

A professor, it was indicated,
should notteli, but should show
that is, he should make contact
with the mind as well as with the

heart. ,
ft ls ‘apparent that many

pertinent arguments were raised
by those participating in this
discussion, however, it is equally
obvious that as the discussion
lengthened, the subject matter
broadened into unfathomable and
unweildly depths. (as too often
occurs with academicians.)
Dispensing with further
interpretations, it might here be
appropriate to state the remark of
one astute member of the
audience who counseled that the
mark or result of education is
everything the panel members
