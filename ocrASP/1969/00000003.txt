lilywhite

Mostly the blacks notice the
color of college students. They
notice that while the country’s
Negro population is about 11%,
only 2% of the nation's college
students are nonvwhite. In New
York City, with its large black
population, for example, black
students at Queens notice that)
out of 10 of their fellow students
arewhne.

They have been told all their
lives in words that they are as
good as white men. But they have
also been told by the action of
almost every institution their
paths cross that they aren’t as
good, aren’t as smart, aren't as
worthy. The schools are in the
forefront of those institutions.
And the blacks are asking schools
to make good their high—sounding
words about “educational
opportunity."

For the schools, the demands
of black students pose grave
problems-complex issues are
being raised which question the
purposes and structures or
long-established processes and
programs.

What do they want?

What do militant black students
want? Most of their demands at
the dozens of colleges where they
have pressed for change are of two
types: demands for more
autonomous control over their
education, and demands for
admission of more black students
to colleges and universities.

Roy Wilkins of the NAACP has
denounced black student demands
for hiring and firing power over
staff and faculty of Black Studies
Departments and special programs
for blacks. He called such
demands “cries for separatism”
and “just another form of
segregation and Jim Crow-ism.”
Such a response seems more nach
than anything else. Whether black
students want real and strict
separation is not clear, but
evidence is that most do not - and
that’most of their efforts which
began as separatism would quickly
change.

Even if some form of apartheid
was intended by the students, it
would not be of the same stripe as
that outlawed by the Supreme
Court in 1954, as Wilkins claims.
Separation chosen by free and
intelligent man, and institutions
run separately in a free and
intelligent manner. are totally
different from separation forced

as a form of slavery on a group.

Desire for Control

it seems clear, however. than
real apartheid and separation is
not what these students want.
They Want some control over the
institutions and processes thle
most directly affect them at the
moment--their schools and the
special divisions of those schools
with which they deal. In that
sense, their demands are no
different from the demands of
white students for more pOWcr in
decision-making in the
universities, more control over
their living conditions and the
kind of education they get. ’l‘hcir
desires cannot be separated from
those of white, students by
invoking the ogre of racism. That
the blacke’ tactics for pressing
their demnds are different from
white students} can probably be
traced back to the treatment they
received for so long in American
cities.

That afternoon, the delegation from the Black Students Alliance

proposals. After some deliberation and clarification. President Collins

The BSA document was worded to insure their participation in the

Department and in the "recruiting and screening" of potential
instructors. They‘wanted a any in "The requirements for qualifications

President Collins questioned the black delegation as to how they
proposed to get these instructors. They were able to reply that they
have been in communication with universities in the U.S.‘and Africa.
Sources say that the University and the BSA expect exchange

programs with African universities as a result of the establishment of
the Afro-American Studies Department.

Before signing the document, Collins and the BSA delegation
agreed upon a “marginal notation opposite these two statements that

The Brothers is a “politicalI
activist group" as described by
one of its leaders, Leon Van
Dyke. The terms militants and
trouble-makers have been
attributed to this organization by
less generous critics. But,
according to Van Dyke, "Don’t
worry abOut labels-let. deeds
speak."

Varied are the "deeds" which
The Brothers perform. Their
programs include Negro history
and literature classes, karate and
photography instruction, the
publication of The Liberator and
community service programs. A
project which was in the planning
stages for a long time is the child
day care center. The Brothers felt
that there was a definite need in
the community for a low-cost
facility which could aid working
mothers.

The Brothers also serves the
community through the Albany
County Welfare Union. This group
attempts to aid Welfare recipiants
in their dealings with the Welfare
Department. Stewards are
available to answer questions and
even assist in presenting a person‘s
case to the department.

Originally, The Brothers was
formed to combat unfair hiring

practices. In the ﬁeld of labor
they are still active. Attempts are
made to provide more job training
programs and better employment
opportunities.

Another aim of The Brothers'
programs is, in Van Dyke's words,
“To get both black and white
politically aware." They endorse
candidates for public office whom
they feel will truly represent their
community. Some of their
members have also tried to attain
elective positions.

Van Dyke said that all of these
programs evolve out of
dialoguewith the community from
which the needs can be recognized
and served. The failures of some
of the programs he attributes to
lack of knowledge and the
bureaucratic system.

in discussing the shortcomings
of the organization, Van Dyke
was more objective than one
would expect. He said that the
whole movement is young and
must learn like a child
does—through trial and error.

The group is not accepted by
the whole community because of
their reputation for militancy. It
is also looked upon as a closed
organization, of a fraternal type
instead of an actively functioning
one.

Collins On Finances

BSA Action Endorsed

by Barry Kirschner
Staff Reporter

President Evan R. Collins. in
the President‘s Conference for
Students on Monday, announced
that the ﬁnancial picture for the
State University system of New
York might be bleak.

Collins quoted figures on the
present per-student allotment and
speculated on the allotment for
the coming fiscal year. The State
legislature in Albany will soon
decide how much money will be
allocated to the State University.

The President mentioned a
provision in Governor
Rockefeller's recommended

budget which suggests that only
96% of the resources for such
item should be allocated. The
possibility of local pressure on the
legislature may force a rise in the
budget tor the State University.
The actions of Jeff Smith, a
member of the anthropology
department, were also discussed.
Smith had called for a faculty

 

strike In response to President
Collins action in signing the
demands of the Black Students'
Alliance. He has since issued a
considerably milder statement.
Also in response to the incident
with the Black Students ‘ Alliance,
the Faculty Senate on Jan. 20
endorsed the actions of President

Collins, and established a
department of Afro~American
Studies.

President Collins was also asked
if he supported a recommendation
of Acting President 8,1 "ayakawa
of strike-ridden San Francisco
State College which would
withhold scholarships to
participants in student strikes.
Collins answered that he disagreed
with the punitive nature of this
proposal.

The President’s Press
Conference is held every Monday
at 2:16 pm. in the Patroon
Lounge in the Campus Center. All
students are encouraged to attend.
Refreshments are served.

The Poor
Their Own Kind

reads, “no faculty appointed unacceptable to student group."

Once the document was signed, the delegation thanked President
Collins and left, saying that they would be in touch.

President Collins icalled a conference with studentsin the Campus
Center. He explained, to some extent, what had happened. BSA
members were present and a “position paper" was passed out by them
and read by one of their members. .

When the six BSA members entered President Collins' office on
Monday, there were over twenty black students waiting on either
another floor or outside. Their plan was to give President‘Collins a
chance to deliberate and sign without intimidating him.

President Collins has repeatedly stated that he did not like the form
of the “demands,” but agreed entirely with the content. He says that
the content “does not exceed the reachable expectation of what
the faculty-might. realistically be expected to do. in pursuance of
policies already accepted." .

Since then, the Faculty Senate has endorsed the actions ofPresident
Collins. It also expressed “concern that normal channels of faculty
participation appear to have been by-passed."

Furthermore it has established the Department of Afro-American
Studies and “authorizad the Executive Committee to take whatever
steps are necessary to implement the action."

The Brothers realize this and
are now trying to communicate
with different parts of the
community. They are attempting
to appeal to the church goers as
well as the drinker.

The Brothers, which is a local
organization with no national
affiliates, wants to help the “basic
needs" of the people. Van Dyke
said, “Everything else is irrelevent,
abstract shit when you can't meet
these basic needs.”
