 or intellectual thought have been
extolled philosophers .thorughcut the ages.
Considering this, we, as new editors of the Albany
Student Pres, feel that the time is now for the
ASP and the students of this campus to begin to
think-arid enter a state of more fulfilling existence.

We are directing our thought at this time to the
current situation, academic and otherwise, that
exists'on campus. We feel that the ASP, much
maligned in the past, has failed to meet the
requirements that a modern American University
demands of its newspaper. The vitality, the
explicitness, the information that should have
been apparent in every issue has been missing. This
condition was brought about not by a lack of
good intentions on the part of the staff, but rather
_by a lack of thought. This situation must .be

changed.

It is for these reasons that the ASP, under new
direction, is now grasping for new ideas, new
concepts, and a new image. We intend to make
this newspaper more receptive to the needs of the
students and, we hope, through this, to make the
students more aware of their own needs.

Consistent with the need for greater relevancy
of the ASP is our desire for depth and purpose in

our news content. Toward this

Without support of this type, we
would have been in greater
trouble than we were. Special
appreciation should be given the
R.A.'s. Dorm Directors, and Miss
Edsall herself. These people served
in many different capacities and

and they did it graciously. The
student-patients were cooperative

off the phones, not pressing for
visiting hours, helping the less
fortunate, etc.

Few on this campus believed
that the Black students would
accomplish anything out of the
ordinary during their years here.
At a moment’s notice they were
' proven wrong. I

We condone, without
reservation, both the actions of
the Black Students Alliance and
President Collins.

After reviewing the available
information, it becomes obvious
that the responsibility for
slow-motion action lies entirely
with administrative personnel.

It is true that many aspects of
the statements presented to the
president were already being acted
upon.

However, it is also clear that
the action was too slow in coming
and, in some respects nonexistent.

It was, as a result, necessary to
promote, with the immediacy
these issues require, action so as
to get things accomplished.

When faculty and
administrative channels break
down, who but students are left
to carry on?

President Collins, in signing the
demands, recognized that he was
acting without the formal
approval of the faculties involved.

Nevertheless, it came down to a
choice between acquiescence or
revolution.

As many of the demands were
already being worked on and
planned by many of these
faculties, the signing of these
demands required no moral or
actual reversal of anyone’s
position.

In view of the alternative it was
apparently practical.

White reaction, though not
universal, seemed to turn from a
childish feeling of rejection by the
administration to a slightly

 

and Alumni Board Open.

discriminatory attitude. (Neither
attitude is prevalent at this time.)

These students felt that the
BSA, because it is composed
entirely of Black students, was
getting preferential treatment.
They wondered why the
administration had never ngrccd
or payed attention to their desires
for similar action.

We suggest the reason is that
these students simply did not
know what they desired, did nor
organize themselvesproperly, and
were not interested enough to
define and actualize their
intentions.

It was clearly proven by the
BSA that action requires
agreed-upon goals, unity, and
cohesiveness in pursuing stated
objectives.

Organization and hard work are
the keys that unlock sticky doors.

All these qualities may be
attributed to the BSA, however.
these characteristics may be
cultivated by any group.

(Perhaps lessons in SUNYA‘s
hierarchical structure would be of
aid to interested students.)

The responsibility for the
unfortunate incident that
occurred following the new
Afro-American History course has
not yet been deteimined.
however, if there is any more
trouble, that revolution may
come.

0f the c0urse itself we have
heard only good comments
indicating that education may, in
reality, be both relevant and
exciting.

We hope that an increase in
effective communication in the
University, apparently necessary
in view of recent events, will he
the result.

once an essay question asked of
Dobie Gillis and his pal Maynard,

which has the greatest potential of

while it continues to move

Including our government, and

American involvement in

Even the liberal segment of the
population Is now without a clear
direction. Liberals denounce
‘bosalsm' in politics while looking
to the Kennedy machine for
salvation. This ‘progresslve’
segment of the population refuses
to see the inconsistency of
castlgating the bigotry of Wallace
and Maddox, while condoning the
bigotry of Cleaver and
Carmichael.

The plight of the conservatives
is equally lost In direction. The
conservative ls.paranolcaliy afraid
of losing his liberties to ‘outside
aggression,’ while at the same time
appears anxious to surrender his
freedom to the local police.

Those who seek to change the
system are even more lost than
most. Members of the new loft
visualize a destruction of this
system, but have not taken the
time to consider an alternative.

Richard Milhous . . . It’s 3 AM
and dark in your new room. Pat ls'
snoring softly. And it In just you
and Jackie Kennedy’s restored
SulysPostropedlc King Size and
the January wind; And the

‘ crawling horrors throbbing and

pulsing whisper in'the night. But
"It, all we do Is to tell you about
what we see. We tell you about
Richard who has been Dick far
too long.

Like we saw you on television:
You were introducing the new
cabinet, grinning like a kid. All
successful businessmen. You said
it a dozen times, with pride.
America needs the
“addeddemension”, the. extra
special something showing
irrefutable capability. Business
knowhow.

Who could question but that
men like those will slide into their
.new government responsibilities
like the refined, oily lubricants
that they each and all are.
Business is the proving ground of
the mind. That was what you
meant was It not? With their
credentials we could no more
mlstake the approach they will
take to their positions and the
ardor with which they will
maintain their . r ‘ " than
we could mistake the spirit of Mr.
Agnew. Even if they, contrary to
Spiro, never say a word more than
a robust ‘Hello, America!’.

We saw a whole bloody screen
full of Successful Businessmen.
0h yes—there was one notable
exception. Just one.

Well, over a course of some
time perhaps that might explain a
little of the lonliness and all, but
really, is that enough to make The
President of the United States
schizoid in the dark? With the two
burly guards in the hall asleep
against the bedroom door? All
hail the king of the mountain.

The man who controls the
businessmen controls the free
world. And we all know who

owns who. That is certainly plain
enough. But by the ghost of John
Dulles, it is a hard mattress and
you are restless, responsibilities
and all, so let us whisper on.

Ever hear the one about
Lyndon Johnson and the eyes of
history, Richard? But my, we are
little monsters to talk about such
vague possibilities so late at night.

' And we tell you about them every

night.

There once was a president that
wanted to be well loved
posthumously. With his policies
and friends and mistakes and all
he realized that this was quite
impossible in his ,own time.
Remembering, though, how slave
holders like Washington and sons
of expediency like Lincoln had
managed to put over a good one,
he figured that a simple brutal
genocidal murderer like himself
had a pretty fair gambler’s choice
if only he played his cards right.
And he was nobody’s fool.

He realized, of course, that just
being a paper peace maker was
probably insufficient for historical
purposes. What happened after he
left office was also vital and he
knew that pragmatically he was
much better off if the figure he
r ‘ ‘asr " ‘wasalesser

man than he with the originality ._

intelligence in decision
the Mad Hatter's

and
making of
itching ass.

It was a difficult choice to
make. He had the remnents of
party morality to consider.
However, in the face of history it
became plain that a faded liberal
like HHH, no matter what he
seemed to be, was unreliable. Not
being quite dead, Humphrey
might somehow prove the
stronger man in office.

Lyndon realized the office did
strange things to men. And “if”
Historical Hubert created a real
Vietnam peace, well then, how
would paper Johnson read in the
revised curriculum? Being

desperate,
bogging down all over, he actually
had no choice. So he had to'
remove his political skills from
under Humphrey’s feet, allow the
Convention and then the
campaign to collapse, thereby
preparing almost certain defeat
for his personal stooge on the
assurance that the fool who could
choose Spiro T. Agnew could
louse up almost anything.

And so the fool with
experience sailed right on In
without ever having to say a word.
Not even “Thank you Daddy
Bird."

And you lie here where Jackie
used to lie, Richard Milhous, In
the dung of Chester A. Arthur, in
the water closets of Warren G.
Harding. And you dream of drunk
Mammle and the return of the
right McCarthy. And Second
Hand Dick Days are Gone
Forever.

Except in t' a middle of the
night, Richard, alone with the
devil doubts, the monster doubts,
the glowing horrors of the
blackest dark. Leader of our
nation.

Happy New Year, voters.

70,000 native-born Americans 0f
Japanese ancestry were arrested
and herded without trial inlio

abuse of government power took
place only 27 years ago during
World Warll.

In 1942 martial law was NOT
declared on the West Coast and
yet these 70,000 Americans (and
40,000 aliens) were deprived of
their liberty without due process
of law. The Supreme Court In
Karamatsu versus United States
held that the arbitrary removal of
110,000 persons from their homes
and their detention, without a
hearing behind barbed wire and
bayoneta, is in accordance with
the Constitution. None of the
70,000 was charged with a crime.
None had a hearing. None had a
day in court. But they had names
like Munemau and Kenya.

Last week,‘ Presiden’t Nixon in
his first major blunder, proposed
that “dangerous hard core
repeters” should be held in
temporary “pre-trial detention"
for the public safety...before
being convicted of any crime. This
is contrary to the established
American custom of due process,
and would fall most heavily on

should contact me at 472-8895 or
leave a note in the ASP office.
Brieﬂy, Rep. Scheuer is a Bronx

most liberal records in Congress.
He was the first Eastern
Congressman to support Senator
McCarthy, the author of several
key pieces of legislation and was
re-elected recently with the highes
