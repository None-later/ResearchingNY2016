"Lamp ‘At Midnight’ Opens

For One

“Lamp At Midnight," Barrie
Stavis’ drama about the 17th
century Italian astronomer,
Galileo Galilei, who 400 years ago
charted the heavenly courses
followed by today’s Appollo 8
astronauts, will appear here at
Page Hall for one performance on
Monday, February 17 in the
course of the play’s current
pro-Broadway coast to coast tour.
The one local appearance is being
sponsored by Dramatics Council
of the University.

The drama will be seen in a full
production staged by Sir Tyrone
Guthrie, one of the foremost
directors' in the English speaking
theatre today and will star one of
America's leading actors, Morris
Carnovsky. A supporting cast of
18 Broadway players will be
featured in the production.

Showing

Although dealing with events in
the 17th century, this deeply
moving play is very up to date. In
1609, Galileo turned his new
telescope to the heavens and there
discovered the true order of our
solar system. But this discovery
lead Galileo into conflict with the
Catholic Church. lf‘ Galileo's
astronomy was true, then the
statements in the Bible about the
sun revolving around the earth
were open to question; if Biblical
statements were false, what would
happen to Church teachings?

At a moment in history when
the Roman Catholic Church is
fraught with internal questioning
on many long-standing positions,
Galileo’s ancient challenge seems
surprisingly contemporary. And as
our astronauts begin to make a
mere jaunt out of
once-legendary moon journey, it

hard-edge pleated canvases reﬂect
her interest in strong line and the

alternating color patterns creates a

trick that anthropologists of a
hundred years from now may
regard as deﬁnitively American:
sincere, tender affection expressed
in cool, childish antagonhrn;
Csssavetes is very good at showing
this playful banter slipping into
real knock-down arguments. But
usually “Faces” falls to tell us
anything new.

Why? Partly because of the
lmprovisatory device itself. Unless
your actors are very good,
improvising tends to collapse into
the actors’ professionalism seizing
the stock response; they may
even. as they do here, reach into
bad drama for their
inspiration—art imitating art
imitating life. (One example—the
businessman's story about his
son’s sneakers, which is pure
Chayefsky.) Cassavetes’ actors
simply stick to the pat reaction
and rarely risk dimension or
depth. At one point: “You're a
son-of-a-bitch, do you know
that?" “And why am I a
son-of-a-bitch72: “Because you get
to me." Substitute "rat" for
“son-of-a-bitch" and we're back
to l930's Warner Brothers.

bumbling openness, at least
sincere—unlike “Up Tight," a

“Up Tight” is a film one of the '

make: it stinks of white
fantasizlng. (The introduction of a
white liberal purely to make an
idological point is especially
nauseating: the blacks reject his
help when he could save Johnny's
life. Moral: blacks better realize
that white liberals are their
friends.) The ﬁlm tries to pal s
bourgeois confusion of conscience
off as realism. It fastens on a
currently volatile issue and uses it
to turn a trick at the box office.

It evades responsibility in a
cloud of TV theatrics. It’s the film
of a white. and not a particularly
sensitive or tasteful white.
