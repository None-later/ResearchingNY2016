‘White Soul’
Of Joplin

In Concert

Janice Joplin will give a concert
at the University on February 14.
In addition, ‘Farth Opera' will
also appear. .

Miss Joplin brings to Albany
students their first look at a real
“leadbelly blues" singer. At
previous concerts students have
listened to the strict rock of the
Union Gap, American Breed, First
Edition, and 'the folk singing of
Judy Collins and Theodore Bikel.

Joplin's style of singing has
been called ‘l‘white soul" but in
her own‘words she describes her
style as “white, middle-class
old -time beatnik."

Up until 1966 Janice sang
smooth and easy in the folk clubs
and bars of San Francisco. But
then she got a chance to try out as
the singer for ‘Big Brother and the
Holding Company.’ From then on
she began singing in the loud, soul
voice she is associated with today.

Since their last concert at
Stonybrook, Janice has left ‘Big
Brother.’ At her Albany concert
Janice will probably be backed up
by Skip Prokop on drums, Doug
Lubahn on bass guitar and Sam
Houseton Andrew on lead guitar.
Andrew was the lead guitar for
Big Brother.

While she was singing with Big
Brother Janice had a hit single‘
release, “Take Another Little
Piece of My Heart." This song also

appears on the album Cheap
Thrills. -

Following Janice Joplin will be
Earth Opera. The group consists
of Dave Grisman, Peter Rowan,
John Nagy and Paul Dillon.

Rowan composes most the
songs the group plays. They
basically play blues.

Tickets for the concert will go
on sale Monday, February 10
from 10:00-3:00. Tickets will be
$2 with a tax card and $4
without. You must bring. both
your tax card and LO.

The doors will open at
approximately 8:00, Friday night
at the gym.

To‘fight to defend a government
which he considers murderous
would be as hypocritical for
Claude as it wasfor Hamlet to

experience a feeling of
helplessness to do anything about
their predicaments. Hamlet's
apparent indecision is matched by
Claude’s unsuccessful attempts to
summon up enough courage to
burn his draft card. Both seem to
be waiting for the appropriate

“Hair,” also directly in the middle
of the play, shows a marked
contrast. All his friends have

"Hamlet" brings about its
inevitable conclusion, so also does
the climax of “Hair"--Claude dies

Comparison and Contrast:
Through this unique
comparison and contrast, Ragni

dilemma of young people today as

it is stand alone at the corner of
the stage and mourn.

That the audience should be

‘ reminded of “Hamlet” is
.obviou'sfvallusions to it are-made
throughout the play. It is
unfortunate, though, that these
references are often overlooked
because of the shocking,
unpatriotic. irreligious, erotic
nature of the play, and, of course,
the famous nude scene, but they
are definiter there.

An eerie, occult setting opens
"Hair" and corresponds to the
gloomy ramparts of Elsinore. in
the scene an oracular message
emerges from the song,
"Aquarius," heralding a time of
peace and understanding. Inter in
the play, we hear the very first
words spoken to the ghost in
"Hamlet": “What art thou that
usurp’st this time of night?" They

  
  

’ﬂrera is, also, in ' "Hair" a
playiwithine-play scene directed
by Claude paralleling the one
directed by’ Hamlet; both young
men see the" stage media as an
appropriate vehicle for
accomplishing their ends. The
most direct allusion to the earlier
playl though, is in a song whose
words recount the predicament of
Claude and the rest of the tribe-it
is simply a word-for-word musical
rendering of thirteen lines from
the famous prose speech Hamlet
delivers to Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern: “What a Piece of
Work is Man!”

Let us not be mistaken, then,
and judge “Hair” to be but a
frivolous, ribald, chaotic
production. Gerome Ragni and
James Redo are obviously well
acquainted with Shakespeare.
They have translated the dilemma
of "Hamlet" into modern terms
and thus created in “Hair” a
tragedy as only the twentieth
century can produce it.

IntersessiOn Wins

The 1968-69 edition of Albany
State’s varsity basketball team
seem determined to secure that
NCAA tournament berth which
eluded their predecessors of last
year. The hardcourters ran their
unbeaten string to eight games
over the intersession break and
brought their record to 10-3 on
the year.

Among rumors of national
ranking among small colleges, the
Danes ‘met West Chester '(Pa.)
State College in the first of three
road games. The Pennsylvania
squad, a university level team who
plays the likes of LaSalle. Temple,
and St. Joseph's of Philadelphis,
was led by three double-figure
scorers.

The Danes, with Rich Margison
scoring 25 points and hitting on
13 of 15 free throws, ran away to
a 3648 halftime lead and coasted
to an easy 71-55 victory.

The Danes did not "coast" to
their next victory as they
managed to edge Hartwick College
in overtime. 77-76. Margison and
company turned a sixteen point
deﬁcit around in the last twelve
minutes of the second half as
junior Jim Sandy sank a clutch
bucket to send the contest into
overtime and then insured his
hero status by scoring four points
in the extra period.

The Canes then traveled to the
big city to take on the Kingsmen
of Brooklyn College. After trailing
through the entire game, Albany
tied the score at 66-66. Brooklyn
attempted to freeze the ball
through the last minute,
preferring to wait for one last
shot.

A chance turnover on a driving

layup with six seconds left to play
gave the ball to Albany. Margison
took an inbounds pass, dribbled
to half court and, with two
Brooklyn men on him, put up
what seemed to be an impossible
shot. But as the buzzer sounded
the heavily partisan Brooklyn
crowd went into a frenzy as they
watched the 45 foot shot drop

cleanly through the rim of
Albany's basket.
Margison, having difficulty

finding the range during most of
the game. contributed 21 points,
bringing his seasons’ average to
21.3.
Bambi. as Margison is known
due to his slight build and
demeanor on and off the court,
has been named to the ECAC
All-East team for three
consecutive weeks.

He has hit in double figures in
every one of his 56 varsity
basketball games since his
sophomore year. in addition, the
6-1 performer has moved into
fourth place on the University’s
all-time scoring list.

EDITOR'S NOTE: We are sure
that it has occurred to every State
fan that this year's very deserving
team may once again be snubbed
when NCAA tournament berths
are decided by the powers that be.
Be it resolved that all the editorial
strength of this paper shall more
than stand bahind a great team,
but shall do all that is in its power
to influence those powers.

It is the role of every single one
of you to support your team in
the most visible way possible;
attendance at the ﬁve remaining
home games. This would be no
small contribution.-J.W.

The Golden Eye Coffeehouse
will open for the Spring Semester
this Friday, Feb. 7, at 9 pm with a
double bill. Topping it will be a
one act play performed by The

Black Experiences Ensemble. ‘

Following that will be the Albany
debut of singer Gary Brown.

The Black Experiences
Ensemble is a local black

- repertory group led by Morris

Hill. Friday night’s presentation is
entitled “Celebration.” and was

j written by and stars Mr. Hill. The
; play concerns a successful black

college football player who makes

 the All America Team, but despite

his popularity, he realizes and

_‘ laments the fact that he is

recognized for nothing more than

; his physical prowess. His friends

and admirers don't think of him
as a whole-man with an intellect
and emotions, but only as a pair
of very fast legs. Most of the play
is involved with this football
player’s reaction to a dinner given
in his honor.

The second part of the Golden

 
   

 

Eye program will be the folk blues
' and bluegrass guitar of Gary
Brown. ‘

Blind Brown

Gary, who records as “Blind
Brown," started playing way back
in. the ‘60's. Soon after finishing
high school. he quit his home of
Shawmut, a small town on the
plains of Nebraska. hitchhlkln'g,
and hopping freight trains, taking .
two and a half years to wander.
two thousand miles east to New

'_ York City. Having played in small

clubs and coffeehouses in
Greenwich Village and Brooklyn,.
and being top-billed at the Miami
Club in Staten Island, he is now
living temporarily in Troy trying
to find if there is anything to be
found in the 'l‘riCity area.

For this week, the Golden Eye '
will request a $.50 contribution at
the door for the recently formed
Black Experiences Ensemble. The
Golden Eye is located at 820
Madison Ave., between Ontario
and Quail streets near the
downtown dorms. For info. call
