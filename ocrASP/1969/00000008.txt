Black militancy

sweeps US campuses

(CPS)——The demand for more enrollment of black students poses,
in the last analysis, a far more serious challenge to the structure of
American higher education as we know and practice it, because it
re-asks the question, “Who is college for?"

There is little question that most colleges are (finally) aware that it
is not only desirable but necessary for them to change their racial and
economic make-up. They are even coming to see that the speed at
which such changes are made may not be up to them. But the big
question still is. “How to do it.”

The first responses to demands from San Francisco State black
students for admission of all black applicants next fall were typified
by Clark Kerr, chairman of the prestigious Carnegie Commission on
Higher Educationpand by Fred Hechinger. the New York Times'
Education Oracle.’l‘hey declaimed, almost in unison, “But we can‘t let
them into our colleges! They're not qualified! It would be lowering
’o‘ur' standards and bringing education down to the level of the
uneducated.”

The usual solution given by such men to the problem of “what.
then to do with them" is to shunt those who can‘t pass College
Entrance exams into trade schools. That way they can say they're
offering a chance at higher education without polluting the halls of
ivy, but such a solution only perpetuates the odd. almost caste-like
system which characterizes our schools and which all students are
reacting against.

What else can colleges do? They could, of course, let the students in
wholesale, as the San Francisco State blacks advise, but that would be
a cruel and cynical hoax. Letting the students in with no prior
warning, and then (as would inevitable happen) flunking them out the

’i‘li’eI ‘l'ask bore: for Academic Affairs held an open hearing on the University Calendar Thursday night in
the Fine Arts Gallery. The purpose of this task force was one of examining the present academic calendar

and considering any changes that might be beneficial both now
(only about 75 person), but voices were loud.
The moderator for the evening, Professor F

calenders under consideration. They are as follows:
I) The Quarter Symmf This plan divides the present academic year into three equal parts of about 10

weeks. The student carries the normal live course load in each term
credit of the course under the semester plan.
2) The 3-3 Plan: Under this plan the at idemic

only three (or maximumly four)
courses each term. Regular
semester credit is received. The
same amount of material covered
now in 15 weeks is expected to be
covered in 10 (classes more
often.)

3) The Trimester System: An
eleven month period is divided
into three equal trimesters which
are equal in every respect. This is
for year round operation.

4) Modified Semester System
1: The conventional semester
system is retained but starts early
in September. All course work is
finished before Christmas
vacation. After vacation students
return for a reading period and
take final exams. Second semester
begins Feb. 1.

5) Modified Semester Systsn 2:
Classes begin immediately after
Labor Day and the first semester
including finals, is over before
Christmas. After a longer
Christmas vacation students
return for the second semester
which ends during the thrid week
in May.

6) The Semester System: The
system we now have.

Professor Kolmin emphasized
that no decision has yet been
reached and that the committee
will not have any final decisions
to make, only recommendations.
He then opened the meeting up to
questions and comments from the
audience.

The first question concerned
the implementation of any change
and when such a change would be
effected. Professor Kolmin stated
that the committee
recommendation would be given
to the President and Vice
President of Academic Affairs

who would probably bring it
before the Faculty Senate and

possibly Central Council After
recommendations by these groups
the question would be returned to
committee and finalized in detail.
He stressed that this was the
probable course of events, but he
was not certain. Any change could
not be implemented until the fall
semester of 1970.

In response to these statements
a number of students questioned
the lack of consideration given to
a student vote. Duncan Nixon,
President of Central Council,
stated that‘Pr'esident Collins had
assured him that no ﬁnal decision
would be made until Central
Council had a chance to make a
statement on the issue. Some
dissatisfaction was still apparent
and Nixon ‘was aslred if it would
be possible to hold a student
referendum. Nixon stated that it
would be awkward, since the
proposals would have to be
presented in extreme detail, but it
would be possible. Another
student asked if the Task Force
could delay its report so that a
student referendum could be held.
Professor Kolmin said it would be
possible but that he thought it
would be of little significance at
this early stage.

Another girl wanted to know
why the process would take so
long citing SUNY at Stonybrook
and their change coming next fall
after a report due in April Along
with that question she also asked
if any consideration had been
given to the four course load in
each semester with an
independent study program in
January. Her first question
remained unanswered until later
when it was repeated. The main
reason was that the summer and
next fall programs are being

and in the future. The turnout wasslight

rank Kolmin, began by outlining the six basic types of

, each course counting twoethirds the

year is divided into three equal parts. Students register for

planned now. and it would take
:quite a large effort to change all
those plans. Concerning her
:second question it was stated that
under such an arrangement the
number of courses and the credit
‘for each course would have to be
reconsidered since some classes
met less and others stressed
vyindependent study. It was felt
that this would be too complex
for a large university like Albany.
Professor Prakken of the
~Classics Department, who has
taught and/or studied under ‘all
the proposed systems spoke in
favor of the quarter system. He
cited as its advantages that all
exams were completed before the
major holidays, that courses were
at the same time everyday giving
the student an equal load on each
day instead of one class on
Tuesday and ﬁve on Wednesday,
for example. The number of
exams is reduced during the terms
and so the student does not enter
a vicious exam schedule. In
addition. it is flexible'enought to
allow both acceleration and
experimentation in the university.
An Assistant Professor from the
Graduate School of Public Affairs,
who left before this reproter
could get his name, spoke
concerning the graduate students.
Seventy five ‘per cent 'of the
graduate students are part time
since they also hold jobs. For
them, he stated, the 3~3 or quarter
system would be most
unfavorable since they would find
it difficult to finish 15 weeks
work into 10 weeks while
working. He asked if it would be
possible to have separate calendars
for graduates and
undergraduates.

 

next term, would do little for
black students’ already badly
damaged self-image.

Of course these students aren’t
qualified for college as we know
it. They have grown up and been
educated in the ghettos and

subcultures of this nation. where
they don’t always learn the
answers to College Board exams
and haven't had the requisite
number of Humanities courses.
But perhaps that says less about
their qualifications for college
than about the college‘s
qualifications as educational
institutions for this time and
place.

Another favored response to
the problem. particularly among
these who call themselves "libcrnl
educators." is the establishment
of special programs which offer
unqualified students rcmediul
training to “bring them up to the
college level." Such programs are
in operation at a number of
schools, with varying degrees of
success. Many of the schools
operating them have been the
scenes of the loudest of the black
student protests. Students in such
programs often feel they are just
being told again that they are
inferior, and sense waves of
condescension from
administrators and other students.
