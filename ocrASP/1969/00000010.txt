on the American stage.

the American Shakespeare
Festival in Stratford, Connecticut,
Carnovsky received critical
acclaim for his powerful portrayal
of Bhylock,» in “The Merchant of
Venice," and for the role of
Prospero in “The Tempest," and
King Lear. Carnovsky's career has
included teaching, directing, and
acting at the Actor's Laboratory

in Hollywood, the Goodman.

Theatre in Chicago, and at Oberlin
College. ,.

Csrnovsky’s performance as
Galileo, the 17th Century Italian
astronomer, in “Lamp at
Midnight” has been hailed by
critics as one of the greatest stage
performances of our time. Of the
role, Carnovsky says, “Here is a
man of science and a man of deep
religious faith, in human terms,
whose simple, shining goodness
was touching, and whose scientific
brilliance was awesome.

“The role presents a huge

challenge to any actor, which I .

gladly accept on its own terms."

“Lamp at Midnight" was first
produced off-Broadway in 1947.

Dramatics Council is sponsoring
the only performance in this area
of “Lamp at Midnight" as it
prepares for its Broadway debut
later this spring. Tickets are on
sale at the Campus Center.

Center Ballroom will be a
milestone in the history of the
arts at Albany State University,
for it is the first Black Theatre
production ever to be presented
here. All of the work involved in
the production, except for
sponsorship, has been entirely in
the hands of students of the
University.

The director of the play, sophomore Daniel Barton, is the only student
involved who has had previous formal training in the field of drama; he has
been working with his fellow black students on campus for the past four
months to put together a competent volunteer production.

“Tambourines to Glory" was written by Langston Hughes, an
internationally-known poet, novelist, and playwright.

The plot involves the founding of a corner church in Harlem by two
ghetto women, one of them influenced by her saintly compassion and the '

experience and a very colorful
