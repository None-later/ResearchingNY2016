‘6—0. Ithaca also has a fihe shooter
in Greg Albano who is averaging
19.3 a game. Ed Kawalski also
averages in double figures for
ithaca.

Albano and Kawalski also lead:
{ithaca in rebounding, pulling
down 14 and 10 respectively.

Siena has an unimpreasive 5-7
record. But they have one big
advantage, height. Their starting
teaml'averagee 6-4. Their two big
men up front are Torn Sheridan
and Bob barman, both 6-7.
Herman is averaging 22 points a

‘ Every- Great Dane rooter remembers the stinging reasoh5thati the

just too weak!" What they meant was that we play the likes of New
Palta State, Oneonta State. Oswego, Piattsburgh, Potsdam, etc. These
are, perennially, the weaker squads that State faces. And yet, few
could hold back a chuckle or two when little Buffalo State easily won
that very regional tournament. Buffalo had won the State Athletic
Conference that year—an endeavor which took up more than half its
schedule—by defeating such tough competition as New Paltz State,
Oneonta State, Oswego, etc. . . .

' Adding insult to injury, the regional committee, heavily weighted
with New England-member schools last year, chose a mediocre (12-8)
Northeastern University team. Happily, New Yorkers, and Albany in
particular, will no longer be subject to the same regional committee.
The NCAA-small college \division realigned the regions over the
summer and New York and New Jersey now comprise one region
known as the Eastern region. Any new intra-regional‘ bias may work in
Albany’s favor now for most New Jersey teams participate in the
NAIA post season tournament. This leaves the four team NCAA
tourney ﬁeld almost exclusively to the Empire State. >

Both LeMoyne College of Syracusevand Buffalo State will be very
strong contenders for tourney bids. Both have fine records and show.
impressive victories against tough opposition. Albany is not without
its big victories, the most important being over Merrimack, Siena, and
Hartwick, all by one point. An impressive sixteen point wrn over West
Chester State, a university division team, will also look good to this
year's regional committee. Luckily, the New Paltz, Omega, and
Potsdam games will come after the committee makes their selections
this year.

All this brings Albany, with a 12-3 record and a ten game win
streak, to tomorrow night’s game with Ithaca. This and the Siena
game, Friday, will decide whether or‘ not Albany State’s cagers are
deserving of a bid. Victories in these two games should insure the
Saueramen a tourney invitation, just one year late!

The Albany freshman

The freshman hoopstersled by
20 points at halftime and seemed
to play a little sluggish in the
second half. But their lead was
too big for Hobart to overcome as
they went to a ball-control game
offense late in the game.

Albany wonthe game mainly
on their defense, as they forced
Hobart into several turnovers in
the first half. The teams
shooting-eyes were off as they'hit
only about 30 percent of' their
shots from the floor. V '

Dan Coker was Albany‘s high
scorer with 15 points. Cokely is
an EOP student and he could add
the extra strength the team has
been looking for.

Mike Bendzeil, who has been
playing good ball for Albany since
returning from his ankel injury,
scored 11. John Heher scored 9.
Heher has been averaging 16.

THE

Vol.l.V mg 945
Senate denies

state aid to
‘lawbreakers’
Compiled by Norm Rich

ALBANY, Feb. 12--Spurred by
the specter of the Columbia
disturbance, the State Senate
voted Wednesday to deny state
aid to unruly students.

Sponsored by Sen. John E.
Flynn, Rep. of Yonkers, the bill
penalizes any student convicted of
an on-campus' felony or
misdemeanor.

The latter category includes
such crimes as "aggravated
harassment, criminal nuisance,
possession of noxious
material"--such as smoke bombs,
and similar crimes associated with
campus demonstrations.

Funds curtailment would
primarily take the form of State
Regents Scholarships and Scholar
Incentive Awards. Understood by
the Senators, an amendment also
would be included affecting such
grants as SEEK, a program which
provides help for the
“environmentally deprived"
student.

“These young people are now
getting out of line completely,
especially when the taxpayer is
subsidizing their education,”
asserted Sen. Flynn, summing up
the debate for the G.O.P.
majority.

On the other side, Democratic
Senator Harrison J. Goldin noted,
“We are indulging our passion for
shallow vindictivenesss...the other
side (GOP) is more interested in
saving money than in solving the
serious social problems which
confront us.”

However over one-quarter of

the Democrats did indeed vote
"yea" resulting in a final vote of
37-15. The bill is now passed on
to the Assembly.
Lust year, following the Columbia
episode, Republican Majority
Leader Earl Brydgcs succeeded in
passing a similar bill, differing
from the present bill only in that
the power to usurp uid rested with
the Board of Regents.

Brydcs bill was later killed by a
Domocrnticnlly controlled
Assembly. ’I‘hat House is now in
Republican hands. Thus passage
of the bill now appears ' ' ‘

FSA to consider
new meal proposal

Results of the recent meal plan
survey have made evident student
dissatisfaction with the existing
meal system.

As a result, the Room and
Board Study Committee (an
ad-hoc committee of living Area
Affairs Commission) has met with
Mr. Robert A. Cooley, director of
Faculty Student Association.

Mr. Cooley has expressed a
desire to meet the needs of the
student body.

As a result of this meeting, the
Committee has formulated the
following proposals for the
1969-70 academic year.

20 meals (Breakfast, Lunch,
Dinner) per week;

13 meals (Lunch and Dinner)
per week;

14 meals (Breakfast and
Dinner) per week;

7 meals (Dinner) per week:

5 meals (Lunches—non-res-
ldents onlv) per week).

“We are now awaiting price

will be available to the students in
the ASP one week from today,"
said Steve Lobel, Chairman of the
Committee.

The prices and meal plans will
be printed in questionnaires to be
distributed to and filled out by
students when they pick up next
month's meal cards.

The purpose of this
questionnaire is to establish
adequate student support to

warrant the adoption of the above
proposals for next year.

Lobcl noted, “The problem of
studean feeding strangers with
their seconds has already caused
costs toriae substantially. in order
to protect those students who do
not abuse their contracts, the
seconds policy will be
eliminated."

Members of the LAAC Room
and Board Study Committee
include: Steve Lobel, Holly
Cohen, Peter Haley, George
Seyforth, and Sharon Scully.

Registration for the “great movement" weekend, sponsored by the
Niagara Region of Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS )(upstate‘
N.Y.) will take place in the Campus Center noon Friday and continue
through Sunday as the events of the weekend unfold.

The two-dollar registration fee will be used by SDS tohelp'supmrt
their Spring and Summer programs. Conference literature and housing
will be assigned at registration.

Newsreels will be shown today from 4-6 p.m. and Saturday from
6~7 :15, at a' location to be announced. The ﬁlms to be shown will
feature the Columbia revolt, the Black Panthers, and Chicago, created
by radical filmmaker Norm Fruchter.

Two proposals to be discussed at a general meeting tonight at 7
p.m. in LR 3 will he plans for a summer project and an idea for
coordinated regional action against the military on college and high
school campuses.

From 8-9 Friday night in LR 3, SDS will sponsor the Pagaent
Players, a- New York street theatre group. Following this will be a
panel discussion from 9-11 p.m. Chip Marshal, discussing ROTC and
military on campus and the Draft; Bernadine Dohrn,
inter-organization secretary of SDS, on woman's liberation; Jeff
Gordon, of'the Progressive Labor Party, on labor organizing; and Walt
Shepar, on community colleges, will be among the panelists.

On Saturday, February 15, at 9:30 a.m., announcements and
workshop rearrangements will be made in LR 3. This is to be followed
by the workshops in classrooms of the Humanities Building.

The Conference workshops will cover a wide variety of topics,
including guerilla theatre, high schools, underground press, radical
teaching, problems of capitalism, Cuba, racism, socialism, and
imperialism. Some resource people present at the workshops will be
Steve Halliwell, former national officer of SDS; Harry Magdoff, of a
new school for social research; Ted Gold, of Teachers for a
Democratic Society; Nick Freudenberg, a high school organizer; Paul
Sweezy, editor of the Monthly Review; Jim Jacobs, community
organizer in Detroit N00; and Mike Klare, of the North American
Congress on Latin America (NACLA).

noon, after which will be a break until i p.m. Workshops will be
resumed from 1-3 p.m. in the same locations. Newsreel films will also
be shown Sunday at a time and location to be announced.

Among the plans of the four-point program adopted by the Niagara
regional SDS will be for “each chapter to research the power
relationship between its school and the immediate community." This
rcasenrch will be presented at the next quarterly regional convention. .

“Each district is to develop an integratedoistrlct program with
respect to its member chapters and non-student constituencies. The
districts are to develop district consciousness through a district
newspaper, a district program, and district assemblies.

"The program also stresses that Niagarans develop regional
consciousness through a regional newspaper, district-linking programs,
and regional conventions. Regional travelers and a regional treasury
are necessary to implement this program."

Chemistry Departments may also use the
accelerator for research.
The Physics Department hopes to attract
least a dozen graduate students
interested in programs dealing with the
fundamental structure of matter. Fifteen
graduate students and fifteen seniors now
work on the project. Collaboration with
neighboring colleges in the Albany area,
especially R.P.I., is anticipated.

It’s hoped that the Federal and state ‘
governments plus private contributions.
will be obtained to help defray the cost of
the accelerator. The University has also
applied for grants from such institutions as”
