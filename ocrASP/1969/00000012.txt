requested a lowering in the fee from $1.10 to $.95

This service would have been discontinued if the
reduction was not made.

Is it still conceivable that student tax will be
mandatory next year? How?

According to Duncan Nixon, President of Central
Council, it is not very probable that the tax will be
mandatory for Fall 1989. He said that the tax can
be made mandatory by only two methods. These
are: 1. a Central Council elected by the entire
student body could vote to make tax mandatory or
2. a referendum of the entire student body could be
held in which a proposal to make the tax
mandatory would be presented in a peice of
legislation.

Presently, the first method could not be used
since this Council was not elected by the entire
student body.

Does the University grant leaves of absence to
studentsT

No. In order for a student to leave the university,
even if he plans to return, he must formally
withdraw.

Dean Thompson of Student Affairs said that the
student must go to the Student Affairs Office Ad
129 to ﬁll out the appropriate forms. He advises
that a student who is considering withdrawing
discuss the situation with his advisor in the
University College or the academic dean

Why is it that Food Slvice has limited Colonial
Ouad students til-9.95 in their purchase of lunch on
the Colonial cash lioe yet it still charges the person
without a lunch card $1.10 on the contract lines?

Originally, the Colonial Quad cash line was set up
to accommodate paying guests (Le. faculty, staff,
etc) since the Campus Center dining facilities were
overloaded. Mr. Haley of Food Service said that the
food in the cash line is more costly. Ordinarily the
allotment per student for lunch is $.65. This
amount was not deemed sufﬁcient to provide an
adequate meal. Haley said that students, themselves

Will the present system of pro-registration be
continued for next fall?

Mrs. Cook, Assistant to the Registrar stated that
the rotating alphabet system currently used would
not be fair unless it was continued for a longvr
period of time. This system attempts to givv
everyone an opportunity to pre-register during tin-
first days by changing the alphabetical priority iisi
each semester.

A change in the system is not being planned for
Fall 1969 at this time.

This reduction has been made possible by the diligent
efforts of the Bookstore Management and all its people, who
are making continuous efforts to improve this service and
efﬁciency in the Store. Their efforts have converted a deﬁcit
of a year ago into a small excess of income over expenditures,
and we are happy to pass this saving along to our customers.

The above decision could not be made until December 3i

already been marked with the list price, and will be sold at
that price during the coming rush. Students are asked,
however, to hold their green sales receipts and tum them in for

Your rights  arrested

Editors Note: As an attempt to keep our readers informed of their legal rights the ASP is starting a
series entitle “Your Rights if Arrested." The series has been lifted with permission from a public service

pamphlet of the same name.

The purpose of this series is to give you information on your rightsuif stopped by a policeman, searched

or taken into custody.

The policemen has his job to do. He stands for law and order. Respect him; do not talk back or be

disorderly.

It is a crime to resist an officer who arrests you lawfully. If it turns out that you have been arrested

unlawfully, you may sue the policeman for false arrest.
But remember: your arrest or detention may be lawful even if you are innocent.

What is an arrest?

You have been arrested when a policeman or citizen takes you into custody or otherwise substantially
deprives you of your freedom of action so that you may be held to answer for a crime.
A warrant for an arrest is an order issued by a court. The policeman having a warrant for your arrest

must state that he acts under the
authority of a warrant, and also
he must show the warrant, if
requested, and give you a chance
to read it.

You may be arrested at any
time of the day or night by a
pliceman who possesses a warrant
to arrest you for a felony, the
more serious type of crime.
However, if the warrant is for a
misdemeanor, the less serious type
of crime, you may not be arrested
on Sunday or at night unless the
warrant says so. Misdemeanors
include (for example) common
gambling, petit iarcenty, simple
assault, and disorderly conduct in
it public conveyance.

A policeman with an arrest
warrant may break open a door or
window to gain admittance after
has given you notice of his
authority and purpose.

Suppose the policeman does NOT
have a WARRANT?

A policeman may arrest you
without a warrant in the following
situations:

(8) Where he has reasonable
cause to believe a crime is being
committed or attempted in his
presence. This includes felonies,
misdemeanors and offenses like a
traffic violation or disorderly
conduct.

(b) He has reasonable cause to
believe that a felony was
committed and that you
committed it, although not in his
presence. Felonies include serious
crimes such as murder,
manslaughter, arson, robbery,
assault, burglary, extortion, grand
larceny, kidnapping, blackmail
and rape.

(c) When he has reaonuble

cause to believe that you were

lawfully arrested by a prive
person.
When making an arrest

without a warrant, the policeman
must inform you of the reason for
the arrest, unless you are in the
act of committing the crime or are
being pursued immediately after
an escape. In any arrest without a
warrant, if you flee the
jurisdiction with a police officer
in close pursuit, he may arrest you
beyond area limits.

May PRIVATE PERSONS make

an ARREST?
This question and others will be

answered in next week's
installment of Your Rights if
Arrested.

(UPI)--Nationsl Guardsmen
used tear gas grenades and fixed
bayonets to scatter crowds of
rebellious student strikers 'at the
University of Wisconsin Thursday.
Riot police hurled tear gas
canisters to break up a milling
crowd bf students on the Duke
University campus.

On another campus troubled by
student revolt? about 150
club-wielding police made
repeated sweeps through chan ing,
screaming militants at the

University of California; at
Berkeley.

Wisconsin Gov. Warren 1’.
Knowles, who sent 900

Guardsmen onto the Wisconsin
campus at Madison early
Thursday. called an additional
1200 militiamen to duty at
midafternoon in a determined
effort to keep the university open
for classes.

Negro students seized the main
floor of the Duke University
administration building and held
it for nearly 10 hours, threatening
to set school records afire with
kerosene if their demands were
not met or if police were sent in.

A wild melee broke out on the
grassy quadrangel at the center of
the campus after the black
students, surrounded and
protected by friendly white
students, walked out of the
building and marched down the
main campus street.

Before the Negroes. left‘ the

barricaded Duke building in;

Durham, N.C., the university had

issued an ultimatum to them to-

clear out by 4:30 pm EST~and
had assembled more than 70 law
officers to enforce the order. '

It also 'had announced
suspension of all black students in
the building and said they would
be‘subject to criminal promotion
if they did not get out at once.

At Berkelev police arrested at
least three dozen dissidents'in a
series of minor scuffles and broke
up picket lines trying to block the
main campus thoroughfare.

About 1000 students tossed
books and firecrackers and
taunted officers with chants,
catcalls vand Obscenities. Student
lines reformed as quickly as plice
marched through them. '

More than 75 Negro and Puerto
Rican students took over a City
College administration building in
New York City to enforce
demands for recognition of the
needs of minority groups.

At Wisconsin, the Guardsmen
on the scene Thursday appeared
to have succeeded in bringing a
semblance of order to the tense
campus as they kept dissidents
moving and thwarted attempts to
block traffic on University
Avenue, the school’s main stem.

Frosh to nominate
new class ofﬁcers

Nominations for Class Officers
opened last week and many
people have already picked up
their application. In order to
acquaint the members of the
Freshman Class with the
nomination and election process,
the Class Guardians, Connie Valis
and Tony Casaie, have announced
that a Class Meeting will be held
next Tuesday, February 18th.

The meeting, which will be held
in the Ballroom at 7:00 pm will
be an informational meeting that
will explain how a potential

"" ‘- may placo his or her
name in nomination. It will also
explain the function s of the four
Class Officers--President,
Vice-President, Secretary, and
Treasurer. Nomination forms will

be available for those who would
like them. They are also available
at the Campus Center Information
Desk.

Connie and Tony urge all
freshmen to attend even if they
do not plan on running so that it
may be determined whether or
not to hold a campaign rally or
candidates’ night prior to the
election. -

Since those people elected will
determine the plicies and activities
for the Class of ‘72 for the coming
year, it is important for all to
attend. According to the
Guardians, there are numerous
activities such as a Beer Party,
Concert, Spring Weekend, and
New York City trip in the initial
stages which will have to be
carried out by the new ofﬁcers.
