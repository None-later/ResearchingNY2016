entertainment with one of their .

very unconventional productions.
v The Radical Theatre Repertory,
in New York City, is a sort of
coordinating center for about
twenty different tlieat‘re groups
covering most of the country,
each specializing in some
revolutionary method of
expreuing the problems of this
generation.

The principal concepts behind
Radical Theatre are audience
involvement, the breakdown of
established barriers to
communication, and an
alternative mode of existence for
all. The Living Theatre is one of
the more well-known groups
connected with this repertory.

The Pageant Players specialize
in a type of production known as
New York Radical Street Theatre;
they are a long-established group,
having given over 800
performances since their initiation
in 1964, over half of which were
on city streets.

Their aim is to point out some
of the more ridiculous aspects and
problem of the civilization we
have inherited.

The Pageant Players have
contracted this production with
the "Eye" for less than their usual
fee; admission for this week’s
“Eye” will be 75 cents, with extra
donations gratefully accepted.

The performance is on
Saturday, February 15, at 9 pm,
but early arrival is encouraged.

Committee changes

university

by Holly Seitz

“It’s not complete to have
buildings without art work." It's
the aim of the Arts Coordinating
Committee headed by Mrs. Loir
Gregg to remedy the situation of
black walls within the, University.

As the University settled in its
new modarnistic campus several
concerned faculty members
realized that there were little or
no provisions for art work. As a
result, the Arts Coordinating
Committee was appointed by
President Evan R. Collins. ,

Comprised of faculty members
and students the Committee tries
to provide the University with
quality pieces from all realms of
art. At present It has been
estimated that over 300 pieces
have been placed throughout the
dormitories and Academic
buildings.

One of the most recent projects
of the group has been the
decoration of the recreation room

walls

and snack bar of Brubacher Hall,

A mural was hung in the
recreation room which was a
result of a “happening” held in
conjunction with a program
sponsored by the National and
New York State Councils on the
Arts. Guided by Jack Tworkov,
interested students painted an
abstract approximately 60 feet in
length.

This latest effort joins other
projects of the group on the walls
of the University. One of the first
efforts was the travel poster
project.

Mrs. Gregg views the problem
of distributing ﬁne art works
throughout the school as one
almost impossible to finish with
the rapid expansion taking place.

The Committee will in the near
future undertake a fund-raising
campaign. At the present, it is
funded by the Faculty Student
Association, Alumni and Student
groups and outside Foundations.

small number, however, if one is
to judge by the huge turnout that

showed up Wednesday night.

Before the play began I noticed
the interesting stage arrangement
of four separate platforms roughly
describing a trapezoid. Each
platform was a different stage
setting, so to change scenes, all
that had to be done was to dim
the lights” at one area and raise
them at another area.

At the very beginning of the
play we were confronted by the
Devil and he proposed to us the
timeless theme of evil vs. good.
The need of money of two
women, Essie Belle Johnson and
Laura Wright Reed, played by
Arlene Porter and Daniel Barton
respectively, in New York’s
Harlem community gave the
Devil, disguised as underhanded
Buddy Lomax and played by
Michael Smith, a field on which to
wage his battle against good.

To get the money Laura and
Essie start a "church" on a

streetcorner and pass around a
tambourine as a collection plate.

Althought the church was a farce’,
it grew from the streetcorner to a
store front, and finally to a movie
theatre, Tambourine Temple. Of
course, as the congregation grew,
so did the money pile. All the
money illegally taken by Buddy's
devious moneymaking plans made
rich the founders of the churh.

It looked as if Devil Buddy
Lomax was going to win, but
Laura’s guilt surpasses her greed.
She finally allowed benevolence
to triumph by killing Buddy and
taking the blame for the death.

Much credit for success of
“Tambourines To Glory" is due
to Daniel Barton, who proved
himself to be a ﬁne director and
actor--he was a superb Laura!
Because of circumstances Mr.
Barton “pinched-hit” for the role
of Laura Wright Reed. This
handicap turned out to be an asset
and added more humor to an
already amusing play.

movie is unnecessarily muddled
and banal (a point which might’ve
been clearer if a blue pencil,hadn't
excised some of my argument).

What I thought was uninspired.
improvisation now strikes me as-

uninspired writing and direction.
But see “Faces.” I’m enough in
doubt to concede a Scotch verdict
and force myself to a second

viewing-but not too soon, not too ,

soon.

I Quick takes:

“Yellow Submarine"--a visual
banana split. Delightful,
containing some haunting graphic
effects, especially in the “Eleanor
Rigby" sequence. The _ movie
introduces cerebral European
animation techniques to American
audiences and may clear the way
for importation of many deserving
ﬁlms.
“Shame"--Unlike “Persona”
and “Hour of the Wolf," (the one
employing metaphors of style, the
other of content) this latest
Bergman , exists wholly on the
surface--scarcely any metaphor at
all. Its theme is grounded in a
straightforward human situation;
in this sense, it is a regression
from “Hour of the Wolf” (which
was a regression from “Persona").
Max von Sydow and Liv Ulmann,
again as artist and wife, and
Gunnar Bjornstrand as a
bureaucrat, display their
customary grace both solo and
ensemble as they enact a drama of
war, anguish, and loneliness.

“Pierrot le fou”--Godard
simultaneously saying farewell to
his period of dissonant
romanticism (a in “Band of
Outsiders")

Because of student teaching,
several chores, and frustration
over past injudicious cutting of
these columns, this is my last
article for the ASP. Many thanks
to those who took me seriously
enough to praise or to curse. To
all a ﬁnal plea: watch lots of
movies. See anything by Renoir,
Truffaut, Antonioni, Bergman,
Bunuel, Godard, Hitchcock,
Resnais, Kurosawa. Welles, Penn,
Kubrick, and Satajit Ray. See
anything from Poland,
Czechoslovakia, India, France, or
Scandinavia. On second thought,
try to see everything from
everywhere. This column’s
premise has been that ﬁlm is the
most varied, interesting, and
valuable art form today; find out
if you agree. See you in
"suppression."

An empty pool has been the
rule and not the exception at
Albany State—at least when it
comes to the men’s swimming
club. '

The sport, instituted two years
ago when present Athletic
Director, Alfred Werner, came to
Albany, has found recruiting
permanent members difficult.

Swimming was the topic of a
discussion this past
Wednesday afternoon between
members of the swim team,
students, and Dr. Werner. Under
discussion was the future of the
struggling sport and what could be
done to give it the necessary “shot
in the arm."

It has been seen from viewing
other universities that there are
three essentials for a good
swimming program. The ﬁrst. is a
good facility.

By popular ucclamation,
Albany's pool is oneof the best in

upstate New York. t is known
among enthusiasts as . an
“extremely fast pool."

The relative low calibre of
eastern swimming affords Albany
the chance to establish itself as a
powerhouse in the sport as no
other sport at Albany, including
basketball and lacrosse, can. It’s
rise to the upper. echelon of
eastern swimming Is a relatively
short and easy one.

The second essential ingredient
is superior coaching. Albany has
that in Brian V. Kelly. Kelly is an
alumnus of Big Ten swimming and
coached in that conference. He
has commanded the respect of his
men since the early days of the
formation of the club.

The third, and in many ways
most crucial, ingredient is the
swimmers to win meets. Numbers
has been the main problem of
Caoch Kelly from the beginning.

L’ flit?!

Board in 1967 as a club'to be
raised to unity status when it,
was deemed ready, the swim-club»
first swam at the- Albany Public
Bath on Central :Avenue two
nights each week. Because of the
inconvenience of practicing off
campus, the turnout was low.

Turnouts for the team
continued to be low despite the
move to the new campus facility
last spring. More than once,
swimmers had to triple in events,
that is swim in three races—this la
unheard of at most schools and is
not conducive to good
performances.

Despite these drawbacks, the
handful of swimmers have
continued to set new pool and
team records in every
competition. Although coming
close to victory in several meets,
the necessity of forfeiting up to
thirty points (for lack of
swimmers) was fatal.

At Wednesday‘s meeting, it was
the feelingof the club members
that their lack of numbers may be
because of lack of inCentive.
Swimming, a largely individual
sport, takes much dedication and
demands rewards.

At present, the team felt, there
is no incentive to go out and stay
out for the team because there are
few rewards. To solve this
problem, the team requested that
Dr. Werner urge the Athletic
Advisory Board to ignore
precedent and make the struggling
club u varsity sport as soon as
possible, in the hopes that this
will give it the necessary boost.

EDITOR’S NOTE: The swim
club's proposal seems worth a try
to this observe and we urge the
Board to give the swimmers a
chance. It's obvious that the
present method is failing. What
can we lose?

 

 

Rip up our instructions
on selfI-defense.

After all,

it’s Valentine’s Day.

Normally, we Insist that every man read the lnstructlons on self-
defense that we put In every package of Hai Karate” After Shave
and Cologne. But we've got a heart. So on Valentine’s Day, we’d
like every woman to tear our Instructions to shreds. That way you
can give your guy Hal Karate, wlth some Instructions of your own.

Hai Karate -be careful how you use it.
