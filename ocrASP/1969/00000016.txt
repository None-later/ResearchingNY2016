Mr. Walter Tisdale, Assistant to the President,

said that there is a good chance that they will be
ﬁnished by September and there is even a
possibility that some will be used during the

The president of the Class of '71 is Dick Wesley.
Ralph DiMarino, vice president, Bonnie Weatherup,

the sophomore ofﬁcers. -

Previously, many officers have been involved
mainly with social events. Wesley is trying a new
approach. He sees class government as a place where
students can reCeive backing to do almost anything
they want.

One of the activities sponsored by the Class of
'71 was the “Get Dirty" project which succeeded in
painting the rooms at Trinity Institute in the South
End. More proje'cts of this type are'being planned
for the spring. They are ,also trying to arrange a
concert and possibly a social weekend. The recent
toboggan party was a joint effort with the Class of

‘myths’
by Rosemary Herbert

“The myth that government represents, the
consumer is a fraud," stated United Stain
Congressman Benjamin Rosenthal on the subject
of “Government and the Consumers’ Interests"
yesterday.

Rosenthal, a Democratic representative from '
Queens, feels that the consumer and the
manufacturer are always in opposition. As he
stated, “it’s a conflict between us and them."

The manufacturer wants the most profit for his
product and the consumer wants the most quality
for his dollar. The consumer always does poorest
in this conflict for a number of reasons such as
unclear labeling and inadequate information about
durability and operational costs of certain
products. -

Rosenthnl spoke of the “myth” that the
American woman is a "sophisticated" consumer.
She may be sophisticated but, no housewife is a
“walking computer" able to make careful

judgements about poorly labeled
products with so many varieties of
prices and sizes.

The Congressman is particularly
concerned because he feels that
the consumer is not represented in
government adequately.

“Washington is a town of -
power and the wealthy industries by Amt" may"
have sophisticated, highly paid Th e S u m m e r P l a nning

lawyers and lobbies on their side."
In contrast the consumers'
representative is usually an elderly
lady who attempts to right
small-scale wrongs.

There are government agencies
supposedly concerned with
consumer interests, such as the
ICC, but Rosenthal contends that
these “regulatory commissions are
simpl’y not what Congress
intended them to be, they simply
aren’t doing their job.“

‘Eosenthal advocates the
formation of a Department of
Consumer Affairs, or a consumer
cabinet officer with real contact
with the Executive. He is
presently touring major New York
cities holding hearings during
which citizens can air their views
on consumer interests. Such a
hearing was held in Albany this
morning.

Rosenthal pointed out the fact
that no consumer legislation has
been advocated by the executive

Conference, coordinated by the
Office of Student Affairs is the
major event in the orientation
program for freshman and transfer
students. This summer there will
be 7 three day sessions for
freshmen and 4 or 5 two day
sessions for transfer students.

Students live in residence halls
and participate in an extensive
program that gives them a
panaramic view of the many lives
of an Albany student.

Each session includes
discussions on student activities,
student government, informal
“talk” sessionsI as well as
academic advisement, registration,
and a whirl of social activities.

According to Dell Thompson,
assistant Dean of Students, an
orientation program concentrated
in the summer rather than the fall
is most advantageous to the
student because it is possible to

deal with a smaller group of
students so “the environment is
less intense and more realistic."

The program of the Summer
Planning Conference as well as
other orientation activities is
planned by the Orientation
Coordination Committee
composed of students, faculty,
and administration. Besides the
Summer Planning Conference,
there is a brief follow-up program
in the fall and also brief programs
for students entering in the spring
and summer.

Fourteen Conference
Assistances are needed for the

1969 Summer Planning
Conferences. According to Dean
Thompson, “These assistants
carry the major burden of
converying to the new students
what the university is really
about."

Any interested undergraduate
may pick up applications in AD

27

by Ed Weiss

The Student-Faculty Committee to End the War
met Wednesday evening. ,

The Presidio 27, a group of soldiers held in the
Presidio army base stockade in San Francisco, was
the first item on the agenda.

A sit-down strike occured at the Presidio
stockade on October 11, 1968. Twenty seven
prisoners were protesting the fatal shooting of,
private Richard Bunch, who had returned to the
base after being AWOL. ,

Private Bunch was mentally ill, and his mother
returned him to the Army‘only after assurances
that he would be given psychiatric help. No aid
was given to him, and he was placed in the
stockade.

Bunch asked his guard what would happen to'
him if he tried to escape. and the guard told him
that he would have to find out for himself. Private
Bunch started to flee from the guard, who quickly
ﬁred a bullet from his shotgun
which hit Bunch in the back of his
head. killing him instantly. The
Army refused to press charges
against the guard at the stockade.

Twenty seven fellow prisoners
then staged a sit-down strike to
protest the shooting. They were
told that this was a serious offense
against the Army, and when the
soldiers refused to move, they

The soldiers, convicted of mutiny,
which is punishable by death in a
time of war, can get a maximum
sentence of up to 50 years in
prison.

After discussion of the issue,
the committee passed a resolution
to support the Presidio 27 by

five years, while the executive has
proposed bills in almost every
other area of the political
spectrum. Industry has had great
power over this government
branch.

Rosenthal is a member of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee.
After his discussion questions
were directed toward this topic.

Asked if government has more
information about foreign affairs
than the average citizen,
Rosenthal dispelled the
"mystique" that “The President
must know more.”

He said that all the cables and
telephone calls and dramatic
briefings contained the same
information as is found in the
New York Times daily. He said
“Congress and the American
people can make just as much a
value judgement” as anyone in the
government.
