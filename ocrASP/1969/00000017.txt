May PRIVATE PERSONS make an ARREST? . ,
A rate person may arrest you without a warrant if you commit or attempt any crime in his presence,

or if you'have actually committed a felon

tell youths reason for the arrest before arresting you.
A private person will be liable to a civil suit for unlawful arrest if you in fact committed no crime. This is

Can you be DETAINED without beine arrested?

If you are detained for questioning by a policeman (as mentioned
above) and be reasonably suspects that he is in danger, he may search
you for dangerous weapons. If he ﬁnds a dangerous weapon on you,
be may keep it until the questioning is completed, then he must
return it (provided you have a permit to carry it), unless he arrests
you. If, while searching you for dangerous weapons, he ﬁnds anything
else on you which it is a crime to possess, he may take it, and arrest
you for possessing it. When does the policeman need a SEARCH

?

WARRANT

In all other situations a search warrant is needed. A search warrant
is an order in writing signed by a judge directing a police officer to
search a certain place for personal property and to bring the property
to court. The warrant must describe with particularity the place to be
searched and the personal property to be searched for.

The policemen is generally required to show the search warrant and
give notice of his authority or purpose before making a search. A
policeman having a warrant may break open a door or window if you
refuse to admit him after being given notice.

However, if it appears that the personal property sought may be
easily and quickly destroyed (for example, drugs or policy slips) or
that the policeman is-in danger if he identifies himself, the judge
issuing the search warrant may direct in writing that notice is not
required. The policeman may then break into the premises

unannounced

Anything unlawfully seized by the police may not later be used as

evidence against you.

What are your rights when you are in POLICE CUSTODY?

If you are taken into policy custody (this includes juveniles) you

have the following rights:

(a) You have the right to remain silent. This means you can remain
completely silent or answer some questions and not others. It is up to

you.

1) You cannot at any stage be made to answer any question or sign

any statement.

2) No one may force you to answer questions or sign a statement.
You should report any force or threats to the court, the district

attorney and your own lawyer.

3) The promise of a policeman to help you or to intervene with the
court in exchange for a confession is not binding upon him. sSuch
promises are binding only when made by the district sttomey.

(b) You have the right to telephone your attorney and to telephone
your friends or family in order to notify them of your arrest.

(c) You have a right to consult with your lawyer at the place where

you are detained.

(d) If the police wish to question you, they must inform you of

your right to remain silent and the

used as evidence against you. .

t any statement you make may be

(e) Prior to any questioning, members must inform you that you
have a right to first consultwith an attorney and, if you wish, to an
attorney’s presence during any questioning.

The police must also inform-you that if you wish to consult with an
attorney before questioning and you cannot afford an attorney, an
attorney will be assigned to you without cost to you.

If you agree to allow the police to question you and they begin
questioning you, you may still change your mind and request a lawyer
before the police continue the questioning.

Committee

lazﬁnd War

holds Presidio vigil

Continued from page 3
downtown Albany. Some
members of the committee
declared that they will go on a
hunger strike for the three day
period to support the soldiers.

The members also discussed the
upcoming Student Mobilization
march and rally to be held in New
York City on Easter Sunday,
April 6. As part of a national
protest against the war, rallies will
also be held at the same time in
Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, San
Francisco and Seattle.

Many soldiers will participate
in the demonstrations. Easter
Sunday has been picked as the
date of the marches not only
because of its religious
significance. but also because it
will be difficult for the armed
forces to cancel leaves usually
given, to soldiers for this holiday
weekend. A resolution was then
passed supporting the Student

Mobilization. ' ,

Finally, the members of the
committee ,’ thought. of Several
ideas to, try to improve the End
the War committees action on
campus during the spring
semester.

Carol French, a ,prominent
speaker for the Young Socialist
Alliance, stated that soldiers on
leave and veterans could come to
the university to speak about
current anti-war operations within
the armed forces. The committee
hopes to accomplish this shortly
before the march in New York
City on April 6.

Another suggestion made at the
meeting to improve campus
awareness of anti-war activities
would be a program of movies and
speakers throughout the spring
semester. A program committee
was formed to make the
suggestion become reality.

‘Youth 

being examined

by Jim Small

In 1966 members of the
Student Affairs Staff formed a

committee on drugs, sex and‘

othe r related campus health
problems. In 1967-68 this
faculty-student group sponsored a
successful ' workshop and
presented films and panel
discussions concerning the campus
situation.

February, 1969 marked the
beginning of a new group: Social

Rockefeller under

attack for cutting
school budget-

ONEONTA, N.Y.
Charging that Governor
Rockefeller has appeased business
and banking interests and
relegated education to a second
class interest, student
governments from across the state
have joined forces to mobilize
their campuses and public support
to fight Gov. Rockefeller’s budget
cuts in education.
Confederated Student
Governments of State University
of New York, a state-wide student
organization, along with
representatives from City
University and Collegiate am
Institue Student Governmen
Association (CISGA), a studen
government organization of 31
community colleges, has called fo
a rise in personal and corporal:
graduated progressive income ta)
rates as an alternative to thi
proposad educational cuts, whicl
which CSG claims will affect not
only college students, but all
levels of education in New York.

CSG held that Governor
Rockefeller's proposed budget
“will endanger and seriously
threaten the education and future
well-being of the students
currently attending the State
University as well as the future
generations of New Yorkers
entitled to a quality education."

To back up its stand, CSG has
called for a convention of all city
and state student governments in
Oswcgo on Feb. 21-23 to gather
support for mass public action,
including petitions and leach-ins
on every campus and a mass
student strike of classes
throughout State and City
Universities. An Albany
conference, gathering all student,
civic, labor, teacher, and religious
groups concerned about
theGovcrnor’s proposed budget, is
being planned for early March. A
coordinating meeting of
representatives from CSG, CISGA,
and the S'tudent Advisory
Council to theChuncellor of the
City UniVersity will be held on
Saturday. Feb. 15 in Albany to
plan activities throughout the
State.

Confederated S’i‘udent
Governments blasted the
Govornor for offering himself as
the champion of the State
University during his last
campaign, and accused the State
Administration of appeasing
"business and banking interests

which pay less than proportionate
amount of state revenues viu
income taxes than the ordinary
citizen." CSG claimed that the
Governor's action was relegaling
education to a second-class
interest, “circumventing the
Master Plan of State University
which calls for ever increasing

availablility of higher education to
the citizens of New York by
increased enrollment and
increased quality of education."

“We hope to bring public
pressure on the State Legislature
to consider other, more
democratic means to balance the
budget. There must be a
democratic alternative to
Governor Rockefeller's serious
cuts in education, which is no
longer a privilege, but in modern
America a necessity." said Gerard
Colby Zilg, President of CSG.
“Under Governor Rockefeller's
plan, not only will the educational
purposes of State University be
jeopardized, but with the general
cut in education, already for
overtaxed local communities must
bear the brunt of elementary,
secondary, and community
college educational expenses.
Additionally, by cutting
education, Governor Rockefeller,
the supposed champion of
education and the common man,
is crushing the hopes of poor
black, white, and Puerto oRican
communities for a brighter future.
if the ghetto riots of recent years
have taught us anything, it is that
government must be responsive to
the needs of the poor."

in Oneonta, N.Y., on Feb. 7~9,
at a meeting of representatives
from State, County, and City
colleges and universities,
Confederated Student
Governments of State University
called for an increase in personal
and corporate graduated
progressive income tax rates to
replace Governor Rockefeller's
proposad educational cuts. CSG,
founded in 1965 over the battle
to prevent tuition in State
University, claims banking and
business interests are not paying
their fair share of taxes,, and
should be taxad more heavily
instead of cutting public
education and "raising the sales
tax which places its heaviest
urden upon those citizens of low
and middle incomes for which the
State University exists and who
would also suffer from the State’s
ﬁnancial neglect of the State
University."

Futhcr Miller said those who
advocate abortion must try to
explain and justify to them-
selves thc “medical and moral
reasons for the direct killing of
the innocent."

He said there was “no qual-
ilativa difference" between life
at conception and life at birth.

Dr. Kenneth Niswander. an
assistant professor of gynecolo~
gy at the State University of
Buffalo, told the committee that
llberallzlng the state’s abortion
law would "remove necessary
abortions from the underworld
and bring them Into medical
circles where they belong."

Confrontation. This is a broad
spectrum problem solving
organization, composed originally
of students, faculty and
administrative personnel. There
has been a tentative provision for
the inclusion of professional
people from the outside
community also.

The immediate areas of concern
that this group was to deal with
were drug use and abuse and sex.
The novelty of the situation was
the idea that these are not
problems in themselves, but that
they are symptoms of the “youth
revolution."

Treating these emotionally
explosive topics in this manner
removes much of the prejudicial
information which surrounds
them. it is also possible that such
treatment will facilitate
involvement on the part of much
of the student body.

The major purpose of the group
is to examine current literature,
present courses dealing with lhl‘
present situation on campus and
off, and to mount an cducnlionul
program which will reach lhc
entire student body, faculty and
community. Some of the
proposed methods follow.

Educational materials, at hum
of a clinical nature, will be made
available to the whole Campus

A column dealing with llio
legitimate and underground skins
of the discussion will be plum-d in
the ASP.

A film series, which has already
been begun, will be sponsored und
open to the whole University.

Special educational seminars
for limited groups of faculty and
students will be run by qualified
medical, sociology and
psychology instructors.

An Episcopal Bishop Thursdin

Student rebels ripped out
telephones and set off fire
 in an invasion of the
president's office .at Chicago's
Roosevelt University Thursday.
There were more uproarious
demonstrations at Eastern
Michigan University and Ober-
lin College in the latest episodes
of campus rebellion.
A threedayold sit-in conti-
nued at the University of
Pennsylvania but a scheduled
protest march was called g off
because of a snow storm. Negro
students seized the switchboard
at Massachusetts' Clark Univer-
sity. Plans for demonstrations
were announced at Princeton
University and the University of
Missouri.

The Board of Regents opened
a two-day meeting at the
University of California in
Berkeley only hours after the
school's worst outbreak to date
produced 24 arrests and five
injuries.

At Roosevelt, about 100 black
and white students forced their
way into the offices of
President Rolf A. Weil shortly
after noon Thursday and
attempted to force him to sign
a statement supporting amnesty
demands of students disciplined
for previous demonstrations.

The protesters were warned
they face school disciplinary

 action. However, when faculty
. -members

attempted to take
names of protesters, many
demonstrators refused to identi-

' 't'y themselves.

Task force police were called
to the university in downtown
Chicago when students attacked
newsmen, injuring two repor-
ters, smashed news photograv
