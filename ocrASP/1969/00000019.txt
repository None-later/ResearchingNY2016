‘ MORRIS CARNOVSKY (center) plays Galileo in a dramatized version of the astronomer's historical

‘Lamp’ ’ Presents Conflict

D. f , R O

by Richard Matturo

On Monday evening, the
Midnight Lamp Company, with a
cast headed by Morris Carnovsky,
the excellent actor lately noted
for his interpretation of Lear,
presented a dramatized version of
Galileo's historical conﬂict with
the Church—“Lamp at Midnight,"
by Barrie Stavis.

The play begins with Galileo’s
first view through his new
invention, the telescope, and ends
with his return to Italy after a
six-month exile imposed by the
Church twenty-five years later.

The conﬂict between Galileo
and the Church can quickly and
easily be generalized to be really a
conﬂict between science (or truth,
or knowledge, or the
enlightenment of man) and
religion (or falsity, or superstition,
or unfounded authority).

Galileo is told repeatedly by
representatives of the Church that
whether or not what he has
discovered (the four moons of
Jupiter, the rotation and
revolution of the Earth around
the Sun instead of vice versa, etc.)
is true is really of no consequence.

What is important is that the
people do not lose faith in the
Church, for indeed they must if
the Aristotelian astronomy, the
homocentric system the Church
authorizes. is proved false.

Though it is hard for Galileo,
himself a devoted Christian, to see
how his discoveries of these truths
will harm the Church or its
members, he complies with
Church regulations, which are, in
all honesty, not at all rigorous,
and writes his findings as
"hypotheses" instead of "facts."

His book is found dangerous by
the Pope, Urban Vlli, howevar,
not because of the "hypotheses"
he presents, but because of the
dialectic method he uses to
present them: “The book is

. “because it

'n Vs.

uangerous," says the Pope,
teaches men to
think."

And yet the Church is not
made the real villian of the play,.
for its ideas are not presented in a
ridiculous fashion.

Except to a handful of
scientists who will get to read
Galileo's “hypotheses” anyway
and know their worth, whit does
it matter to the common people
whether it is the Sun or the Earth
that moves?

The villain of the play, then, is
neither science nor religion, it is
intolerance. The representatives of
the Church will not tolerate
Galileo's method of circulating his
“hypothetical” truths, while
Galileo, unlike the clergymen, is
portrayed as willing to see the
Chruch's side of the question and
to actually comply with its
regulations.

Galileo is the hero and the right
thinker not because he advances
the “correct” view about the
world, but because he .tolerates
both views, though he believes but
one.

In areverse situation, we as
audience find ourselves naturally
on the side of Sir Thomas More in
“A Man for All Seasons."He
supports the Church's position,
and we sympathize with him, not
because we believe in the
lnfallibility of the Pope or the
sacredness of marriage, but rather
because More is a tolerant man
facing the intolerance of King
Henry VIII who finally beheads
him for his belief.

Thus, "Lamp at Midnight" is
not really an anti-Christian play,
though many of the audience
found humorous only the voice of
the Church's position.

I think that equally humorous
sentiments were placed In the
mouth of Galileo, for instance, his
faith that the "people" will
somehow be more enlightened or

Science
uplifted by knowledge of the
“true” astronomy.

Though we must admire
Galileo’s sincerity and motive, we
might have less faith in the
"people" than he does. But by
letting Galileo voice these ideas,
the playwright gains our
confidence by practicing what he
preaches: He does not stuck the
cards.

On the whole, the play is a
success for the artful way in
which it fairly treats science,
religion, and history.

But not only is “Lamp at
Midnight" an artistic creation, it is
also a significant commentary on
toleration, a subject surely as
controversial today as it was in
1609.

 

 

 

 

An electric blues band a
coming to the Golden Eye this
Friday evening.

In an exclusive interview with
this reporter, Jeff Stein, the blues,
harpist, lead vocal, and master. of
erotic microphone gestures,
revealed the name of the group to
be “Snake Drive." ‘ .

According to a usually reliable
source in close association with
the group, the name is derived
from the Freudian phallic
symbollism of “Snake Drive," a
song by Eric Clapton.

In addition to Mr. Stein. the
group is composed of Jeff Nathau
and Joe Laben alternating on lead
and rhythm guitar, Bill Mason on
bass, and Lyle Borndt on drums.

L a u d e d b y a n
"I-chose-to-remain-anonymous"
WSUA dis-jockey as “the best
nonrecording blues band I have

heard so far," much of Snake
Drive's material, originated with
the gutsy delta blues of Robert
Johnson, deceased. .

They perform a tight rendition
of his song, “Crossroad,” and
their other material rahges all the
w'ay from' Willie Dixon’s
"Spoonful" to the Yardblrds’
“Smoke Stack Lightening."

In the coming weeks, the

‘ Golden Eye will present a faculty

poetry reading, a student-faculty
reading of a Shakespearean
comedy, and one night will throw
its doors open to the International
Werewolf Conspiracy.

~ Snake Drive's first set will start
at 9 pm. The Golden Eye is
located between Ontario and
Quail Streets at 820 Madison
Ave., and admission this week is
only $.36. Uninhibited dancing in
the streets. For information, call

Paul Newman's first attempt at
directing a film proves to be a
successful one. Starring Joanne
Woodward, “Rachael, Rachegl" is
not a great film yet it holds”
promise for what Newman may
do in the future.

F‘entially, it is the story of a
spinster school teacher, who lives
with her mother over a funeral
home. It is the story of her
routine generously sprinkled with
her own fantasies and ﬂashbacks
of her childhood. In the first few
minutes of the ﬁlm, as she walks
to school, she imagines something
dreadful happens to her and as a.
result she is killed. This is pure
fantasy as is the scene where she
imagines herself in the arms of a
fellow teacher with whom she is
just talking. These incidents (and
there are many more) point out

her desire for something to
happen. She longs for a
change--just something different.

This change appears in the form
of a childhood friend, who takes
her out, seduces her and then
leaves her. She believes herself to
be pregnant but later discovers
that she isnot with child but that
she has a tumor. Disillusioned and
destroyed she finally decides to
seek a new anything in a different
city. She leaves town hoping (but
not too highly) for something
iew. The film ends.

The acting in the film,
especially on the part of Racheal
and her mother is good and each
offered insight into their
respective characters. There is a
definite tension between the two
characters because one (the

Circuit Presents
Singer Toby Ben

The next performer for the
Coffee House Circuit is Toby Ben,
who is scheduled to perform
during the week of February 24
to March 1. Toby graduated from
Peekskill M.A. in 1964 and then
went to Farmingdale Junior
College but, in his own words, "I
was too far into music to do any
more study, so after two months I
left and went to the Cafe Wha? on
McDougal Street, New York
City." This, his first official job,
lasted thirteen weeks, at the end
of which he went down to Florida
and got a job singing in Fort
Lauderdule.

Following the folk tradition of
Dylan. Farina, and John Thayer,
he bought himself a motorbike on
which he had an accident, and was
forced to stop playing for ten
weeks. After recovering, he
returned to the Cafe Whu? It was
then he decided he wanted to
meet Pete Seeger, He sang and
told him about himself, Seeger
listened and took him to perform
in the Village Gate, This was the
ﬁrst time he played in front of

such a big audience and he
thought “It. was great." Soon
after this he started writing his
own songs and went to Mexico
with friends to find himself. “I
really got hold of myself there; it
was like being reborn."

Returning to California, he
stayed there for two years to
compose his own music. He then
caught on with a blues band, a
trio which played around L.A.,
and cut a record for Columbia.

He is now again back in New
York performing as a single. He
feels he has the “confidence to
handle any audience and relax."
He says, “Music to me is the fine
art of expressing what you feel
into vibrations of sound, for as
long as I can remember music was
my best and easiest way of
expression.“

Toby Ben will appear as a single
in the Campus Center cafeteria,
starting February 24. Shows will
be 8:00 and 9:30 Monday
through Thursday, and 8:00,
9:30, and 11:00 pm on Friday
and Saturday.

other tries to break away but is
caught up in a lot of guilt feelings.
The tension is interacting if
nothing else.

Newman uses some.fuclnating
techniques in the film. His
inter-splicing of the ﬂashbacks and
the fantasies enrich the film
although at times they are
confusing. (One thinks of the
frequent cutting employed in
“Petulia.") Newman uses the
camera not only to simply record
action but also to give insight into
characters and their emotions.
