‘ Springer Gets : 20thWin.

I ' State's varsity matrnen dropped
a heartbreaking match to Fairleigh
Dickinson, 20-17, this . past
Tuesday night at the Albany gun.
The loss came only aliens Dane

. wrestler, Curt Whitton, was
pinned in the heavyweight match,
the final duo! the evening.

The Dance forfeited two weight
classes, at. 123 pounds and 167
pounds, giving. up fifteen points
before even starting the meet.
Despite this handicap, they
managed to take five of the seven
remaining matches.

After Pazonski of FDU pinned
Mike Barlotta in the 130 pound
class, Weal, Kind, Hawrylchak,

and Springer of State decisioned .

their men.

Fran Weal, in the 137 spot,
scored a close 6-5 win. Bob Kind
won a 15-11 tussle at 143 pounds,

, George Hawrylchak gained a 7-4
 decision at 152 pounds, and Craig

Springer scored a 6-0 shutout in
the 160 pound class.

Springer’s shutout was~doubly
sweet for it was his twentieth
career victory as a vanity wrestler.
Craig’s victory tied him for fourth
place, all time, for most wins by a
varsity wrestler. He equaled the
three-year record of John
Woytowich (1960-63).

Leading Springer and
Woytowich are Charlie Kane with
twenty-the} wins (1956-59),
Dave Pause with twenty-six
victories (1957-61), and Gene
Monaco with twenty-eight wins
(1962-65).

Past national champion Warren
Crow does not appear on the list
of all time winners as he only
wrestled two years for the Albany
varsity.

Springer, most recent in a long
line of ﬁne State wrestlers since
the sport's inception in 1955, has
two dual varsity matches
remaining (Harpur, away, this
Saturday and Cortland, at home,
the following Saturday). He has
no chance of going for Kane's
mark of twenty-three wins, but
can take soul possession of fourth
place with a victory in either of
the remaining matches.

Cagc‘rs Face Potsdam,
So. Conn. On Weekend

Their winning streak being stopped by arch-rival Siena, 73-64,
Albany’s varsity'hoopsters face a pair of games this weekend which
are billed as “most wins" by coach Richard "Doc" Sauers.

The “mus "emphasis, of course, refers to State's hopes for an
NCAA Eastern Regional Toumsment bid. The bids. which wrll be
decided some time next week, are directly effected by the records of
those in contention, especially as selestion draws near.

Nine teams are still in contention, Albany being one of the nine.

'hvo serious threats to a possible bid arose this week. It was learned
that Montclair State of New Jersey was quitting the rival NAIA to
come over to the NCAA ranks. Montclair has a 16-2 record against

strong competition. The

second setback of sorts was the

announcement by the national NCAA committee that LeMoyne
College of Syracuse had been selected as the host of the Eastern

region tourney.

This insures LeMoyne one of the four berths in the tourney.
Albany had made it known that it was interested in hosting the

tournament.

State’s opponent Friday night is Potsdam State. The Bears are
around the .500 mark, but cannot be counted as an easy victory.
Saturday's home bill features the Southern Connecticut Owls. The
Owls play the toughest competition in New England including Central
Connecticut State (who beat State by a whopping thirty-four points).

Leading them will be top scorer Bill Fiske and 6-5 Frank Morglllo,
their top rebounder. Last year, Albany. defeated both clubs on the
road. Potsdam fell, 74-63 and the Owls succembed by an 88-80 score.
State leads the Potsdam series, 17-6, and trails against Southern, 14-8.

EDITOR’S NOTE: It was announced late last night that Wagner
College of Staten Island has been selected for a berth in the NCAA
Eastern Regional Tournament. This leaves two places still unfilled and
puts great emphasis on the results of this weekend’s doubleheader.

The varsity’s record to date is as follows:

Lost at Oneonta, 71-59

Beat Stony Brook, 57-62

Won at Plattsburgh,'64-59

Lost to Buffalo, 66-59

Lost at Central Connecticut, 76-42

BSA observes _,
Malcolm X’s death

by John O'Grsdy

The white population at the
University witnessed another
demonstration of black unity last
Friday, in the form of a public
“memorial day” program in honor
of the late Malcolm X.

Assassinated on February 21,
1965, Malcolm X was an
internationally-known propagator
of the black power movement
whose inﬂuence on his brothers
throughout the world spurred
both the hatred of the white
community and the jealousy of
some of his fellow revolutionaries,

His unifying influence was
manifest again last Friday in a
number of activities on campus,
some of which struck unprepared
observers with mixed feelings of
bafflement, uneasiness, and
curiosity.

A rally of about 100 black
students was held near the
fountain in front of the Campus
Center, where events for the rest
of the day were planned and
announced.

Following this, a group of the
students stood silently together
for several minutes with fists
raised and heads bowed in the
traditional symbol of black unity.

And for those who wished to
escape this spectacle by walking
indoors, the Campus Center lobby
was colorfully arrayed in black
bunting, photos of Malcolm X and
displays of black literature.

The State Quad cafeteria was
designated for an informal
“communal dinner" that evening;
the voice of Malcolm X and gospel
music was piped over the
loudspeaker.

The final event in the day’s
commemoration was a “memorial
service" held in the Campus
Center Assembly Room at 7 pm.

Although not widely publicized
or well attended, the proceedings
were an interesting combination
of poetry readings, biography and
commentary on Malcolm X, guitar
music, and singing.

This was no elegiac expression
of sentiment for a fallen leader,
but rather a reminder and
restatement of Malcolm X’s
objectives.

The biography that was read
emphasized Malcolm's
self-education (attained in part by
copying over an entire dictionary
while in prison); the poems, some
of them written by students
themselves, were militant in tone;
an excellent essay, written and
delivered by a student who talked
with Malcolm X while at school in
Ethiopia, described Malcolm's
crucial role in Afro-American
history and his challenge that “the
black man accept his historical
role and assume the responsibility
for his own liberation."

There have hcen repented
examples of black L .. .. an

existence.

BSA is quite reticent about
publicizing its activities; no one is
“in charge," and there are few
“official statements" for the rest
of the University community to
gauge it by.

This form of public relations
policy (no public relations at all)
is both a safeguard against
misrepresentation and an
expression of self-containment.
BSA has been lied about before,
and does not give an official damn
whether or not anyone is
interested in its activities; “We are
in no way whatsoever an
educational institution," was one
member's analysis.

And thus. if we must learn
something from the public
commemoration of Malcolm X's
assassination, it is simply that a
new cultural force may be
observed growing right in front of
us, the progress of which is
supposed to be none of our
business.

Students met with President
Collins yesterday to discun next
year's rise in the cost of attending
the University, what next year’s
State budget will mean to the
University, and Senator Flynn's
scheduled visit to the University.

Next year the average full time
student who lives on campus will
have to spend approximatley
$2,350 as compared to this year's
estimate of $2000.

This rise of $350 is accounted
for by the increases in room and
board for the '69-70 schhol year.
This increase is much greater than

When asked why food prices
were increased President Collins
offered several explanations .

The expected 5%-7% increase in
the cost of “raw food" next year,
and the inevitable rise in wages for
cafeteria workers Were the two
primary reasons he gave.

President Collins also explained
to the students why there will not
be a no-meai option included with
the variety of new meal plan
options next year.

Since there is no inexpensive,
nearby place to eat that could
accommodate a large number of
students at meal times, the
University would draw caterers,
food trucks, etc. which would just
cause mess and confusion.

Also, there would tend to be
more food kept in the dorms and

this could draw rats, said
President,Collins.
In other matters, Collins

commented, “If Governor
Rockefeller's budget is passed by
the legislature, the University will
suffer."

The cut in educational expenses
means that the University will
purchase less library books next
year than it did this year, and hire
less new faculty members than it
should to maintain the present
quality of education.

It was was also announced that
on March 5, 1969, Senator Flynn
will visit the University as an
invited guest of the students.

The Senator will explain and
discuss with students his bill on
banning aid to students convicted
of crimes occurring on University
property.

“Have each student gdvernmsnt
support a thoroughly organised
one week strike and boycott of
classes on all sour campuses to
be accompanied by a mass rally in
Albany scheduled for March'19."

This was one of the major
.resolutlons passed unanimously
by Citizens United for
Responsible Education, CURE,
after a three day conference in
Oswego this past weekend.

The CURE conference was
"coordinated by Confederated
Student Governments, (CSG), in
order to discuss and protest
against educational cuts in the
Rockefeller budget.

(Cont’ederated Student
Government is a statewide student
organization composed of
representatives of the State
Universities of N.Y.)

This resolution and others were
passed after several meetings
including a general informational
meeting and several workshops.

The representatives were
informed about two proposals
being considered by the State
Legislature. One proposal, drawn
up by State Congressman Ed
Spino, calls for an increase in
tuition to $700 per year. This
means an increase of 76% over the
tuition new paiid. '

The CURE conference was
informed that tuition, now used
to pay for stable building costs.
would be used also for operational
costs in the future. 'Ihese
operational costs always rise,
simply because of inflation. The
idea of increased tuition to fund
these costs would set a precedent
for increases perhaps even on an
annual basis.

It was agreed that “a college
education is no longer a privilege
of luxury, but a right and
necessity in modern society," and
that tuition increases go against
the tradition and aim of the State
University system, to make higher
education increasingly available to
residents of New York State.

It was agreed that these
