Guameri

by Warren'Burt

Concert goers at the University
were given a rare treat Friday
night with the appearance of the
Guarneri String Quartet at Page
Hall.

This group, artists-in-residence
at SUNY at Binghamton,
performed a varied program of

String

compositions ranging over three
centuries in a manner. that can
only be described as brilliant.

The group, consisting of Arnold
Steinhardt and John Dalley,
violins; Michael Tree, viola; and
David Soyer. cello, was sponsored

under the auspices of Musk

Council.

Funk Art; new balance
of absurd and pathetic

by Susie Weschenfelder (CPS) "v

A synthetic green lawn
upholsters a free form sculpture.
Fiberglass feet are imbedded in a
steel slab. A banana is plugged
into a wall socket, No, you‘re not
feeling the side effect of speed.
Welcome to the Land of Funk
Art.

The word ‘funk’ dates back to
Victorian times when a young
lady who “funked on the floor"
had no graver problem than
fainting.

Andre Previn revived the word
in the '50s when he told his jazz
musicians to “make it funky."
The hot blues were threaty,
emotional, deep-down blues. In
funky art the material was
unimportant—only the creation
itself mattered. '

‘Funk Art' is essentially a San
Francisco creation. Harold Paris,
writing in "Art in America,"
believes that artistsfelt betrayed
by the traditional forms and ideas
of their society, and so turned
inside for the answers.

“The casual, irreverent,
insincere California atmosphere,
with its absurd elements, weather,
clothes, ‘skinny dipping.‘
sun-drenched mentality, Doggie
Diner...a|l this drives the artist's
vision inward."

Funk art is NOT intellectual,
rational, or formalistic. What,
then, actually is it? Funk art
virtually defies description. The
accepted definition seems to be,
“When you see, you know it."

A bit puzzled by this funky
answer, I was helped along the
way by one student who told me
that “Funk art is like going to a
Sears Roebuck Christmas party
dressed in Montgomery Ward suit.
The hostess wears bobby socks
sad serves Ovaltine and alphabet
"up."

It Is usually threedlmensional,
earthy, and spontaneous. It is
witty, working with paradoxical
materials like foam rubber and

asphalt. It pens on cliches; “a belt
in the mouth" may mean exactly
that in funk art.

Bruce Nauman, a West Coast
artist, dumped flour on the floor,
scrambled it up and called it
"flower arranging.“

He was more than pleased when
a janitor threw it away at the end
of the day, not realizing that it
was a work of art.

Funk art reassigns traditional
values. There is planned
misaffiliation~Winston Churchill
standing next to a gorilla, for

example.
And there is a nostalgic,
sometimes pathetic quality in

funky things. This summer, when
“metaphysical funk monk"
William Wiley organized a “space
opera," the show, which looked
originally like talent night at a
Kiwanis fund-raiser, had the same
strange appeal as a Trivia contest.

in the setment “Two on u
Teetertotter," both people wore
long underwear, blew harmonicas,
and rotated on a seesaw. It had
the haunting quality of childhood
past, and yet it was wildly funny.

The balance between the
absurd and the pathetic spells true
funk. Funk art is most of all
funﬂn attitude that says, “Go
on, why not?"

   

provides fine performance

The program began with a
selection from the 18th Century,
Mozart’s Quartet in F Major; K.
590. The work, a late one, was
bubbling with many tunes and
singable motives in Mozart‘s best
manner. The Quartet’s
performance of the piece was not
only ﬂawless, but revealed a great
understanding of the music.

The 20th Century was then
more than amply represented by
Paul Hindemith’s Quartet no. 3,
op. 22. The work, an odd one in
that it is in neither of Hindemith's
more popular styles, his
“Gebrauch music" or his
symphonic, as in “Mathis der
Maler;” is unusual because there
are no bar lines in the entire piece,
save the last movement.

Instead, throughout the piece
we merely get a steady,
unaccented pulse of quarters or
eighths which the composer here
exploited to the best of his
considerable creative talents.

Especially notable was cellist
David Soyer’s performance in the
fourth movement, which features
some immensely difficult passage
work for that instrument.
Throughout the Quartct's playing
was marvelous, and their tone
exceedingly brilliant.

The final piece represented the
19th Century. Schumann’s
Quartet no. 3 in A Major, op. 41
was a delightful and tuneful piece,
enjoyed by all, its many melodies
played to perfection by the
extremely able members of the
Quartet.

As an encore, the group played
the Scherzo from Mendelssohn's
Quartet no. 2, op. «14. This light
and fluffy piece provided a
thoroughly enjoyable climax to an
already brilliant evening. The
Quartet lived up to its reputation
as “the best in the world."

15...]... "Drive Band

by Jim' Fichtliorn

More than 300 people crowded
into the'basement abode of the
Golden Eye Friday night. They
came to hear good blues and got
what the wantedin the Snake
Drive Blues Band.

During the ﬁrst set both the
band and the , audience were
getting warmed up and by the
time they had ﬁnished, the
atmosphere was charged. Several

With the sound. After a short
break things picked up where they
had left off. More people started
dancing; those who couldn't or
wouldn’t just clapped or tapped.
But, however they expressed it,
they were caught up by the wail
of the blues.

The most memorable number
was "Spoonful" which swept up
and carried the audience along.
People simply became one with
the music. As one listener
described it: “It started and then I
drifted off." That was the general
feeling, drifting but not quite
because the band was leading and
everybody was following. And
when they got to the end the

everybody came back and filled
the vacuum left by the band with
applause and cheers.

When they finished the songs in
the second set, the audience
would not let them go, so they
stayed and jammed for a while
longer. Finally, the end came and
the people left physically, but
their minds still reverherated in
the atmosphere of the blues.

The Snake Drive will be back
with more great blues at Page

good blues, come and see them

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Concert

at Sirma College Friday night

“Folk singers . . . could hardly
find a more tasteful model than
the work of ‘Ian and Sylvia'" said
the New York Times in reviewing
their disk, Four Strong Winds.

Not only the Times' formidable
critic, but connoisseurs of folk
music throughout the United
States and Canada, have been
charmed ' by the honesty, the
poignancy, the genuine musical
ability and the scope of 'Ian and
Sylvia’.

At a time when everyone who
owns a guitar is trying to get in on
the folk music windfall, ‘lan and
Sylvia' stand high above the
crowd by virtue of the integrity
and good sense inherent in their
every musical presentation.

They have the invaluable ability
to judge what is good and what is
not. They have the patience and
enthusiasm to experiment with a
song that “seems right" for them
until their voices, their
accompaniment, their pacing,
their emotions, each assume their
tenuous balance in an artistic
unity.

Their repertoire of English and
American classic ballards,
mountain music, Negro blues.
cowboy ballads, and French
Canadian material is faultless.

They can infuse their own
personalities into the rendition of
a song, thus giving it life, without
ever intruding to the point where
they would distract attention
from the essential value of the
song.

Both Ian Tyson and Sylvia
Fricker are Canadians. Both were
successful performers in their own
right before they met and sang
together in a Toronto coffee
house.

Ian grew up on a farm in
Canada’s cowboy country, the far
west province of British
Columbia. The great thrill of his
early years was the rodeo. As soon
as he was old enough, he travelled
the surrounding ranchlands to
take part in the rodecs.

It was while recovering from a
serious rodeo injury at the age of
nineteen that Ian was able to
concentrate completely on his
deepening interest in music. He
was drawn to country music in
particular and learned to play the
guitar.

Though he majored in fine arts
at University, Ian’s real interest
continued to be music. After
graduation he took small singing
jobs wherever they were available
and studled with Roy Gilesl. the
noted English folk singer.

Guest introduced Ian to the
whole range of folk music and he
became especially involved with
mountain and country singing. He
was moved deeply by the high
wailing Kentucky tenor. lle
hitch-hiked cast to the
cosmopolitan city, Toronto to
perform country music in coffee
houses. There he met Sylvia.

Opera guild
to sponsor
‘Carmen’

The Schenectady Opera Guild
is sponsoring a performance of
Bizet's “Carmen” on Saturday
night, March 1, 1969 at Linton
High School, in Schenectady,
performed in English by the
Goldovsky Grand Opera Theater
under the artistic direction of
Boris Goldovsky.

Bizct's "Carmen" is the finest
product of French lyric theater
and is also the most popular
French opera in modern history.
Much of its success is due to the
enchanting rhythms and melodies
which have almost become a part
of our folk music.

Often called “the
opera" it boasts several colorful
and three—dimensional leading
characters as well as several minor
roles which are sketched with
complete credibility.

perfect

Performed originally as an
“opera comique," that is with
spoken dialogue, Boris Goldovsky
returns to that concept for this
production of Bizet‘s “Carmen.”

There are certain places in the
film where the camera heightens
the effect of a scene. A prime

,' ofthis‘ L ‘_, isseen
when Fanny decides to leave the
Follies and follow Nick to
Europe.

She catches train and then cab
in a mad pursuit to the dock, but
arrives too late to catch the boat.
Undaunted .however, she
convinces a man to take her to
oceanliner in his tug boat. We
then have the camera move away
from an extreme close up of
Fanny only to reveal her riding
out of New York on the front
deck of the boat.

All the while she is singing
“Don't Rain on My Parade” and
as the camera moves farther and
farther away, the effect of the
visual picture in combination with
the song provides a sensation so
strong that the viewer not only
applaudes but shouts bravo!

The final scene continues in the
same vein. The camera again
heightens the emotion of the
scene by moving back from it, but
this scene has the added advantage
of lighting effects.

Fanny comes on stage after
saying good-by to Nick. She
begins her song of “My Man," her
voice shaking with emotion. The
camera slowly moves away and
the lighting which up to this point
has been subdued begins to
brighten.

Finally, she bursts into song
with an intensity which when

~combined with the brightening
lights and the distance of the
shots adds poignancy to an
already emotionally charged
scene.

All the world loves a “Funny .

Girl" and judging from the movie
of the same name, I tend to sgr'oe.
Barbra Streisand ssmanny Brice
and Omar Shari! u the” infamous
Nick Arnstein, combine their
talents to make this one of the
better films of the year.

The story Itself is the old rags
to riches routine except instead of
a fairy godmother we encounter a
delightful Jewish mother. There is
more to the film than just the
simple Cinderella story of “My
Fair Lady" and other such stock
musicals.

True it is a musical, but when
you consider that the music is
Barbra Streisand, it becomes a
different story. The music is an
integral part of the film not only
because it is the story of a'
singer-comedienne, but also
because it evokes involvment on
the part of the audience.

This is especially true in the
scene where Streisand does a
rendition of “I'm the Greatest
Star." A friend told me once that
after he saw that scene he felt that
he could have applauded
something more than a celluloid
image on a silver screen.

The acting in this ﬁlm is
fantastic. Streisand explodes
throughout the film and her many
talents are not disappointing. Her
acting tends toward the excellent
and her singing is superb.

Omar Sharif holds his own in
the same impressive way. His
portrayal of Nick Arnstein is both
believable and moving. He handles

his emotional scenes with a
certain finesse that is very
effective.
