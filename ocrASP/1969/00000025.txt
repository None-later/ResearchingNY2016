" ’BOUND

"-g ‘ By Jim Winslow

  
 
 

 

 

 

 

Sometime this morning, in New York City, the Eastem regional

. toumamcnt selection committee of the NCAA will meet to decide the
remaining two berths in the four team tourney to be held at LeMoyne
College in Syracuse. Both LeMoyne (13-6) and Wagner College (16-6)
of Staten island have already been selected with mac other schools
still being considered for the two remaining bids.

General consensus at State seems that the Great Danes hardcourters
are neither the last nor the least among those nine teams and hopes
are high that the committee will let its whimsical finger fall on

ban .

Actiially. this whimsical linger follows several obvious guidelines,
three to be exact. They are records, comparison of schedueles, and
pure backroom politics. . _

The nine teams, as of Monday night, are Buffalo State, Rochester
University, Montclair State, Geneseo State, Hamilton, Southampton,
Oswego State, Farleigh Dickinson (Madison), and Albany.

The ﬁrst guideline, records, is easy to interpret and several teams
can be quickly eliminated. Farleigh Dickinson, (13-7), Geneseo (9-6),
and Oswego (12 - 4, but against inferior opponents) can be crossed off
the list.

This leads to the second consideration, comparitive oppoents.
Hamilton, (12-3) has lost important games to lthaca, Sienna, and
Rochester. Rochester in turn has lost to ltha'ca and to Fordam by nine
points each. '

Southampton (16-5) has lost to their only common opponent with
the others, Hartwick. They lost that one by ten points. Buffalo State
lost to Oswego State but have impressive victories over [these (20

pints), Oneonta (19 points) Potsdam State(15 points) Plattsburgh
i) 14 points) and Geneseo.

Montclair State of New Jersey (19 - 2) has lost to almost nobody
and should have no trouble getting the third bid in the toumey. It is
the fourth bid that stands in doubt, in this editors eyes, between
Buffalo State and Albany.

Their several impressive wins plus a close 83 - 78 victory over the
University of Buffalo seems to give the edge to Buff State. But the
third guideline, an unwritten one, is still to be considered. Dr. Alfred
Werner, Albany's able athletic director, is a member of the infamous

selection committee. This small fact cannot be discounted. The only

other school in consideration for a bid with a member on the
committee is Hamilton College. This has to give Albany a slight
tactical advantage in the all-important and indeﬁnable politics that
will undoubtedly take place.

The ﬁnal paragraph to this column will be written in New York by
the selection committee. Here’s hoping that paragraph will be a happy
one for Albany.

Swim Club Setback Twice;
Six Team Records Broken

The Albany Swim Club set six

Rocky seeks
18yr. old vote

by Tom Carey

Governor Rockefeller asked the
Legislature Monday to lower the
voting age in New York to 18 by
1972.

The Governor backed his
proposal by explaining that the
young people “are ready and
willing to assume the rights and
responsibilities of full citizenship
by age 18."‘

He said that a great number of
young adults between 18 and 21
are married, work, pay taxes, and

 

 

 

 

are subject to the draft.

“A man old enough to defend
his' country is old enough to help
determine the leadership whose

policies affect his very
added the Governor.

With regard to the
campus unrest the
argued that “the

life,‘

fraction of our youth must not

penalize the vast majority of
capable of
c i t i z e n s h i p

American youth
e x e r c i s i n g
responsibly."

Rockefeller continued, “Other
state legislators have also
expressed their confidence in our
young adults by submitting
similar constitutional amendments
lowering the voting age to 18. I
urge the passage of this proposal
to bring our young people into a
positive participation in the
democratic process."

The prosposed constitutional
amendment to become effective
must receive approval of the 1969
and 1970 Legislatures, and be
approved by the voters at the
1971 general elections.

In other activity at the Capitol
this week, Assembly Speaker
Perry Duryea named a special task
force to map new legislation
aimed at providing an "equitable
and workable" way to deal with
law-breaking college'students.

Duryea selected four
Republican assemblymcn for the
task force but added that they
would seek the opinions of college
administrators, government
leaders and student leaders.

His announcement followed
previous indications that some
changes were in store for the
Senate-passed bill (524) now
before the Assembly Education
Committee.

Assemblywoman Cook,
chairman of the Assembly
Education Committee, said she
had some serious doubts about

the bill and was particularly
concerned about “who
determined what unlawful

assembly, aggravated harassment,
and criminal nuisance are defined
..

Duryea said in n slutcmcnt that
“there is no question of

disagreement between the two
houses."

He added, however, that "we
recognize that the primary
responsibility and jurisdiction in
these matters belongs to the
administrators.”

Aassmblymun Charles

Henderson of Steuben County
was named chairman of the task
force. Serving with him are
Kenneth Bartlett of Syracuse,
Francis McCioskey of Wantugh,
Long Island, and Alvin Suchin of
Dobbs Ferry.

Committee recommendations
are expected within two weeks.

of violent campus demonstrations

WASHINGTON UPI—The
nation’s governors turned aside a
demand by Gov. Ronald Reagan
of California for a federal
investigation of campus disorders
Thursday, pledging instead their
full support for anything
President Nixon might do to solve
the problem.

The National Governors
Conference acted on assurances
by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
and Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell
that the FBI and Justice
Department was keeping a
continuous watch on disruptive
college demonstrations for
possible violations of federal law.

Agnew furthermore told a
closed session of the governors
that Nixon was “terribly
concerned about the sweeping
disorders on the campuses of the
United States," which the Vice
President said were now spilling
over into high schools,

Reagan, who has taken a tough
stand on numerous outbreaks of
violence on California college
campuses, said there was evidence
the demonstrations ware
coordinated nationally.

He urged the governors to call
for a broad federal inquiry that
would determine, among other
things, whether U.S. financial
assistance might be withdrawn
from institutions or students
which “permit or perform
unlawful acts."

No vote was taken on the
Reagan proposal. The governors
instead adopted a resolution,
recommended earlier by their
Executive Committee, supporting
Nixon's efforts to preserve higher
education. "which is being
jeopardized on many of the
nation's campuses."

One source in the private

  

meeting said about 10 governors
sided with Reagan against the
ﬁnal resolution by voting for a
pro-investigation amendment
offered by Gov. John Bell
Williams, Miss.

Gov. Buford Ellington of
Tennessee, the conference
chairman, said the outcome

should not be interpreted as a slap
at Reagan because of the
administration's assurances of a
continuing investigation that
began in the Johnson

 

 

Melvin Belli

administration.

Mitchell said in a statement
that federal law agents were acting
under the 1968 Civil Rights Act,
which prohibits use of interstate
commerce facilities with intent to
help incite or take part in a riot.

At Nixon's request, the Vice
President relayed to the governors
a formula devised by the Rev.
Theodore Hcsburgh, president of
Notre Dame University, which the
President has endorsed.

Mr. Connaily concluded by
stating that he will be available to
discuss any student question or
grievance regarding any action of
the security police.

Also, the Political and Social
Positions Committee stated that
State Senator Flynn has accepted
an invitation to explain his “riot
bill" to students, This bill was
recently passed by the State
Senate, and is currently awaiting
action by the Assembly.

Flynn will appear at the
Campus Center Ballroom on
Wednesday March 5. Doors will
open at 7:30 PM. Seats will be
delegated on a “first come first
served basis." Admission is free.
