AN ASP FEATURE
by Daryl Lynne qur
StaffRsporter

What h University Council:
Just what this council does and
how its decisions inﬂuence
University life is a subject about
which most students are ignorant.

At present, the members of the
University Council are: Mr. J.
Vanderbilt Strsub, a partner in
the law ﬁrm of Hinman, Straub,
Pigors and Manning, and Vice
President of the Board of Trustees
of Albany Law School, Chairman;
Mr. Kenneth E. Burmaster,
President of the First National
Bank of Scotia; Mr. John R. Hauf,
President, John B. Hsuf, Inc., a
furniture store; and Mr. Harry 0.
Lee, a partner in the law firm of
Lee, LeForestler, Frost and
Garvey.

Also, Mr. M.L. Levy of the
General Electric Company; Mrs.
Edna S. MacAffer, an alumna of
the State University of New York
at Albany; and Mr. Walter H.
Wertime, President of the Cohoes
Savings Bank and a trustee of
Albany Law School. The
remaining Council seat is vacant.

University Council meets at the
University the third Thursday of
every month except during July
and August. Special meetings are
called when there is a matter of
urgency at hand.

Meetings of the University
Council are closed to the general
public. President Collins is present
at all meetings, and is often
accompanied by Dr. Clifton C.
Thorne, Vice President for
STudent Affairs; Dr. Allan A.
Kuusisto, Vice President for
Academic Affairs; and Dr. Milton
Oldson, Vice President for
Management and Planning. From
time to time, other members of
the academic community are
requested to attend Council
meetings for the purpose of
submitting reports .

The concept of University
Council differs from that of most
other University organs in that its
function is completely removed
from the academic life. It
therefore has very little to do with
students and faculty, and devotes
itself to the duties enumerated
under theEducation Law . The
administration is the only means
of communication between the
students and faculty and the
Council members. Likewise,
President Collins and Dr. Thornc
must keep University Council
advised of happenings on campus.

The recent LAAC proposals
will soon bring the ideas of
University Council into the open.
Assuming that the liquor policy
and 24-hour open house bills are
upprOVed by faculty committees,
University Council will have the
final say as to whether or not
these proposals are to become
law.

University Council has been
known to be a relatively liberal
group, having recently approved
the bill that eliminated curfcws
and sign-out procedures and
initiatied closed doors during an
open house. It is not expected
that the proposals now pending
will encounter any difficulty at
the hunds of University Council.

“It is certainly not the desire or
the intention of the Council to be

a rigorous discipline v "
remarked Mr. J. [Yanzzglt

Straub, Council Chairman. “We
don't want to feel that we are
denying something. We assume
that students will show a sense of
responsibility when we choose to
allow them their privil'eges."

In reference to the so-called
“Riot Bill" now before the State
Assembly, which would
discontinue Regents scholarships
to students convicted of crimes
committed on campus, Vanderbilt
said that, in his opinion, “this is
not the right remedy.”

University Council is vitally
interested in the growth and
expansion of the University, and
sees for Albany State a future as a
“high-grade, high-quality center of
learning."

The New ‘York State schedule
of Scholar Incentive Awards will
is. revamped, if a bill introduced
{by Senator Edward J. Speno
(It-Fast Meadow) is passed and
signed into law. Speno said, “This
is a time when we must seek
priorities in 'our support of all
levels of assistance and it is
necessary to reevaluate and
readjust these awards." He
continued, “The intent of this
assistance is to help students in
families with limited income.

“This bill will shift the
emphasis giving larger annual
payments to students from
families in the lower and middle
income groups."

The proposal, on the heels of
the Governor's budget message
which allocates $36.6 million
dollars in the 1969-70 scholar

incentive program would raise the '

per semester allocation to

low and moderate income:

avery' student in the state is-
eligible for the scholar. Incentive
Awards provided he has received a
Regents High School diploma.
The new budget estimates
249,000 students will ,be the
reeeipients of , scholarships,
fellowships and scholar incentive
grants in 1969-1970. . ‘ '

Senator Speno concluded,
“With the rising cost of college
expenseeyin public and private
institutions, it is essential that we
continue to give financial support
to college students and base it on
the need of each. This will insure
that studetns who uire
ﬁnancial help will have it."

The bill is co-eponsored by
State Senator Basil A. Paterson

Welfare groups protest I cut;

 

3000 assemble at State Capitol

by Tom Carey

About 3,000 people gathered at the Capitol Tuesday to protest
Governor Rockefeller's proposed 5 percent cut in the welfare funds.

Hulbert James, director of the New York Citywide Coordinating
Committee of Welfare Groups and coordinator of the rally, said that
the demonstrators came from many parts of the state, including 50
busloads from New York City.

Explaining the aims of the Children's Day Rally, so named because
almost 60 percent of the state welfare goes to children, James said,
“We want to make Feb. 25 the turning point in New York State when
it. comes to welfare services and our priorities."

Mr. James pointed out that if the budget cuts are made, “the
assistance which now amounts to $4,160 per year for a family of four
would be reduced to $3,800 per year."

“A cutback will increase malnutrition. A welfare mother In a family
of four cannot make a cutback in her rent—that's fixed. She cannot
make a cutback in utilities—those are fixed.

“She must provide her children with a minimum amount of
clothing, 80, when you talk about the three basics—food, shelter, and
clothing—the only thing she has control over is food and that’s where
she will make her cutback," James said.

Mr. James added, “There is a real danger, I think if the cutback
goes through. It will add to further unrest in the city because people
will say that going through the traditional channels doesn't work. i
hope that I am wrong."

Governor Rockefeller commenting on the demonstration said, “I
understand their problems, but where they really ought to go is
Washington."

The Governor added that the state and local governments cannot
meet the rate in the growth of welfare and education costs; New York
gets back only 6 percent of all the tax money that it sends to the
Federal government. .

Some of the demonstrators did not believe that the governor
“understood their problems," for a few persons hurled snowballs at
the Rockefeller car as It passed the demonstration.

The feelings of the crowd varied from high optimism to bitter
pessimism.

A middle aged mother with her four children said she was
disappointed that Rockefeller did not personally hear their
complaints. She added, “I thought he was man enough to at least
listen, but I guess he isn’t.”

She continued, "1 think our demonstration did some good because
we showed by our number that many people are upset about the
cutbacks."

. A young man from the Bronx said, “This is just the beginning. The
demonstrations are going to get worse if they don't do something.
This was just a demonstration; if they don’t do something about the
cutbacks, next time they might not have a building."

Many of thpgde‘monstrators carried signs such as “Business profits
from welfare misery," “Citizen Comm. to save Dental Medicaid" and
“Can you live with Rats and Roaches crawling all ovor your house?
We can't and we need better housing."

Another group of citizens was at the Capitol too as one o. the
group said, "To sit down and talk with the Sen. ers and
Assemblyman ubout the cutbacks in Social Service."

A representative of the Foster Home Program of Brooklyn felt that
he was well received by the legislators and “that no matter what
eventually happens, any segment of the population that shows
enough concern about certain issues to come to Albany and talk with
the legislators must make some positive Impression on them, no
matter how large or small.
