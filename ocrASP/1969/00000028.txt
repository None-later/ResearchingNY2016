‘Fairy Tales’ opens soon:
satire of American myths

FAIRY TALES OF NEV
YORK by J.I’. Donleavy will be
presented March 12-15 and 1922
by the State University Theatre in
Richardson 291 at 8:30 pm. The
second major production of the
season is being directed by Paul
Bruce Pettit, Chairman of the
Department of Speech and
Dramatic Art.

The cast of four includes
Robert Clayton, William Snyder,
John Koethen and Mary Eileen
O’Donnell. Mr. Clayton assumes
the role of the central character
while the others take on many
roles throughout the play.

The form of FAIRY TALES
OF NEW YORK is that of a revue.
Within this framework the author
has directed his cynical and
satirical arrows toward certain
American myths. A master of
comic dialogue and student of
human eccentricity, Mr. Donleavy

portrays the myths of death, big
business, he-manism and social
acceptance with inspired
irreverence.

J.P. Donleavy, author of the
widely acclaimed novel, THE
GINER MAN, is England's
foremost controversial writer in
the avante scene. Mr. Donleavy
calls himself “an introvert man
writing extrovert words, not angry
about a thing."

FAIRY TALES OF NEW
YORK was a hit of the 1961
theatre season in London . It won
for its author the Most Promising
Playwright Award of the Evening
Standard. The American premiere
of the play was in Albany when in
1962 Arena Summer Theatre
produced the play, directed by
Paul Bruce Pcttit.

‘Zorba’ and ‘Manger’
enrich Broadway stage

NEW YORK UPI—Two recent
arrivals on Broadway are richly
ﬂavored with the spice of old
world folk music.

They are Zorbu, the
fantastically successful mUsiCul
version of the Zorba the Greek
movie, and The Megilla of ltzik
Manger, a hit musical from Israel.

Zorba, Is a musical gem that
should find a permanent place in
the theater, so that future
generations may enjoy its story,
songs and dances.

John Kander has written a
vibrating score and Fred Ebb has
embellished it with sensitive
lyrics. Herschel Bernardi is as
convincing a Zorba on stage as
Anthony Quinn was in the movie.

Marla Karnllova Is outstanding
as "intense. All the music is good,
especially “Life Is” and “I Am
Free,"

“The Megllla of ltzlk Manger"
ls equally entertaining even
though It lacks the box office
appeal of “Zorbu.” For one thing
the title of the musical might
seem too foreign. And the songs
are sung In Yiddish.

But Joe Darion offers a
commentary in English that
makes the plot simple to follow,
lust as a libretto aids the opera

 

May 2-4. was

 

 

 

gocr.
ltzik Manger draws from the
Book of Esther in the Old
Testament to create his story of
outwitting a Persian prime
minister who tries to kick the
chs out of what is now Iran.

Student ticket sales for FAIRY
TALES OF NEW YORK will
begin Monday, March 3rd at the

Campus Center. Admission is
$1.50 or Student Tax and all seats
are reserved. The box office is
open weekdays from 10-4.

New York City In the winter In
an ugly scene. The black clouds of
impure air seem to settle on
mono, be it a burn on the
Bowery, or some blgtlmer on
Broadway. It is winter In New
York, and bread and wine In hard
to come by, even If you go to
daily mass at the cathedral. The
Fillmore-East, In the heart of the
Lower East-Side, becomes the
weekend haven for bums of all
races, creede, and colors, becuase
concertgoers are rich.

Friday, February 21--The
Fillmore East Presents--The
Mothers of Invention and
theBuddy Mile’s Express.

A more perfect setting, the
Mothers could not have asked for.
Somehow, they just seemed to
belong to the whole scene as it
was right at that moment. Zany
Frank Zappa, and his followers,
now numbering nine (addition of
another horn), performed in their
usual uninhibited manner. The
good taste policyof the ASP, does
not allow this writer to go into
detail concerning the uninhibited
actions. (perhaps Suppresion;
otherwise you‘ll just have to see
them yourself.)

The Mothers, on stage, are a
strange collection of musicians.
There are four horn players, two
drummers, an organist, a bass
player, a zylophone player, and
Frank Zappa. In addition to the
regular insturments, the stage is
filled with other assorted sound
makers such as a huge Chinese
gong, numerous cowbells,
kettledrums, and amps for almost
all of the home, a deVICe created
by the ingenious Zappa. _

Friday night's performance did
not include the usual song or two
attacking our way of life; in fact,
none of the numbers performed
could actually have been classified
by the CIA as subversive. Two
songs, including “Bacon Fat,"
were dedicated to the high school
boys and girls, and to the
preservation of rock n‘ roll (Bill
Haley and the Comets style).
There was a great deal of emphasis
on the music end of the
performance, and more than once
Zappa was shown to be much
more of a musician than we might

be led to believe. A mad genius at

work with his mad music II the L

description molt beﬁtting Zappa’e
actions. He conducts every
movement of the bend; and at

times the music got very complex, I

as Zappa meticulously brought
together each member of the
g-oup in perfect harmony,’and
then in an Instant brought out ten

different sounds, each going In Its '
own direction. Zappa, besides. .

arranging the music, showed he
can play a mean guitar aleo‘, I: he
cleverly put his wah-wah pedal to
work for one stint of about ten
minutes. In addition, Zappa
performed on the drums In a most
awkward, but very effective way.

As .you can see, this writer
would find nothing in the
Mothers, were it not for the
musical genius, and zany humor,
of one Frank Zappa. Upon being a
target for a stray vegetable, at the
end of the performance, Zappa
called for the ass who threw the
object to come up on stage and
eat it, and after no reply, simple
said, “well, at least it's not as has
as Berlin, yet."

Also on the bill was the newly
re-arranged Buddy Miles gorup.
Buddy has left the Electric Flag
and the old days of being one of
the parts of a group far behind.

For nine month. or more now,
Buddy has been on his own,
singing the blues and playing the
skins, as only Buddy knows how
to do. Backed by four former
Stax men on home, a fine organ,
bass, and Jim McCarty (Detroit
Wheel fame) on lead guitar, the
Express seemed to be moving fast.
Their final number, "Train,"
recorded live, as were their other
songs that night, by Mercury
Records, brought down the house.
Aside from this number, however,
I would say that the Buddy Mile's
Express has a lot of track to
travel.

— NOTICE

The Modern Musician Club, a
new club on campus, will sponsor
a jungle performance based on the
book THE JUNGLE by Upton
Sinclair and THE CIRCUS from
the mind of Bob Dylan on Sat.
