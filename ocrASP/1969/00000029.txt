Albany State's varsity grapplers go into their finaldual meet this
Saturday wiht a less than impressive record on the surface. The
surface consists of one victory in eleven meets. But the true story can
only be known when a look is taken at the scorebookk.

Bill Mull’s charges have been forfeiting two and three weight classes
in each meet. With such a disadvantage, few good teams could win
even one meet. Despite this handicap, the team has consistently won
five out of the seven remaining weight match-ups in more than half of
their matches. This has resulted in such heartbreaking losses as last
Saturday’s 18-17 setback at Har'pur College.

In addition to the team’s hard luck history, their poor record has
overshadowed several outstanding individual performances. Craig

Springer broke into the elite group
more varsity victories this year an
list with twenty-one wins.

d now stands third on the all-time

Fran Weal, wrestling in the 137 pound slot, has gone undefeated
and unnoticed this year. He has beaten nine straight opponents
including two previously undefeated men. Both Craig and Fran are
seniors and will be wrestling for the last time in a State uniform this

Saturday.

Cortland, always good, has a strong team at all the weights and
looks to give the Mullmen the fight of their lives. The varsity and
freshman matches are scheduled to start at 2 pm, this Saturday in the

main gym.

Fall housing, meal plans

announced by

by Gale McAilister
Staff Reporter

Mr. George Seyfertb, Assistant
Director of Residences, in a recent
interview, explained why room
and board costs will go up next
year and answered many
questions concerning next year’s
housing problems.

For the '89-'70 school year,
(for a normal occupancy room),
the cost will be $565 as compared

last year‘s cost of $395. This
increase of $170 is accounted for
the by the 80% rise in the cost of
construction over the past five

years.

The New York State Dormitory
Authority (who are in charge of
building residences for the New
York State University System) sell
bonds to obtain the capital
needed to build housing, and the
University must provide paying

students to occupy these
buildings.
Seyferth explained that in

order to pay off the increased
amount of bonds, caused by the
inflation of building expense, the
Dormitory Authority had to raise
the housing rates.

When asked about tripling in
the residence halls for next year
Mr. Seyfarth replied that one
third of the double rooms on the
Alumni Quad will be increased to
three person rooms and all four
person suites on Dutch, Colonial,
and State Quads will be increased
to five person suites.

This tripling is necessary
because six dorms in indian Quad
will not be completed until the
spring semester of 1970 and two
other dorms and the tower will
not be finished until the fall
semester of 1970.

The cost for a normal
occupancy room will be $560 per
year, for an increased occupancy
suite on Dutch, Colonial, or State
the cost will be $484, and $420
for an increased occupancy room
on Alumni Quad.

Next year's 20 meal plan cost
will rise from $580 to $620 and
the id meal plan will increase
from $460 to $500. The other
meal plans are lunch and dinner
(13 meals per week) which will
00" $560 and dinner only (7
meals per week) which will be

“50. Kosher meal plans will rise
850 and $30 for the 20 meals and
14 meals, respectively.

These increased cm”; due to
a 54% rise in the cost of ’raw
food for next year and an
expected rise in wages for
cafeteria workers.

Contracts for next year's
housing, will be binding for the
entire year with the exception of
students graduating at the end of
the fall semester or of those who
enter at the beginning of the

Abortion

women ask

Rev. Canavan, Chairman of the'

by Tom Carey
Capital Correspondent

Beverly Warren, Albany State
sophomore, urged a joint
legislative committee last
Thursday to consider the
“abolition of all abortion laws."

Miss Warren, representing the
Radical Women's Association of
SUNYA, explained to the
Committee that “Since women
are those most affected by the
abortion issue, they should make
the decisions concerning it."

According to the statement
read by Miss Warren, the
Association feels that the
procedures of the Legislature,
such as this hearing, point out and
emphasize how even in issues
directly affecting them, women
have no voice."

The statement continued, “The
fact that there are no women on
this committee reflects the lack of
representation of women in the
entire state Legislature."

Miss Warren argued that “more
abortion reform will continue to
make abortion available only to
those who can afford to pay
medical and legal fees."

She added, "Any abortion
reform that does not extend fully
the final decision to all women is
not adequate reform." A

Besides Miss Warren, 20 other
persons including religious.
governmental and medical leaders
testified at the hearing.

spring semester.

The reason Seyfsrth gave for
the contract being binding for the
entire year was simply, “there is
not enough money to handle
changes in the contracts. There
would be an estimated 1,500
changes at midyear, costing some
38000-39000 for the clerical work

recruitment poll

by Norm Rich

Students will enjoy an added option at the poll March 5, 6.snd 7.
To be examined, in the form of an opinion poll, is the right of
external organisations to actively recruit students on campus.

Proposed by Dave Neufeld, chairman of the Social and Political
Positions Committee, the poll will contain the following alternatives:

1. “Open Policy"-campus recruitment for all those who notify thd

placement ofﬁce.

Presently the policy on campus. it has been persued by this
University for the past one-hundred and twenty-five years.

Operationally it takes the form of the Placement Servica, located
on the first floor of the Administration Building. its function “is that
of counseling-and service to the student."

Specifically,

Placement Service receives, from a number of

organizations, requests to meet with prospective student employees.
These organizations may come from any sector of the community, the
only stipulation being that the organization is “legally constituted" as

defined by our Federal Government.

Placement Service then publicizes a list of those organizations
requesting campus space, including anticipated date of arrival.
Students are invited to come to the Administration Building, and

make an appointment for an interview.

All interviews are conducted at the Placement Service ofﬁces, thus
excluding the possibility of “sidewalk solicitation" in such places as

the Campus Center.

A few days prior to arrival, the organisation calls Placement Service
to determine the number of students who have applied for interviews.
Based on this information, the organization decides whether or not it
intends to send a representative to campus.- in the vast majority of
cases, sufficient interest is shown to warrant an actual visit. '

However, in a recent example, Dow Chemical, learning that no
student had petitioned for an interview, decided against visiting the

University this year. ‘

. briefly, proponents of this policy argue that the University prepares
a percepts'ge of its students for ,"career" employment. Thus,
Placement Service. is "a logical extension of this preparation,. and
facilitates the attainment of such a student’s eventual "gosl"-nsmeiy',

employment.

2. "Closed Policy"—no recruitment on campus whatsoever.

This measure, if adopted, would essentially ban all non-university

institutions.
