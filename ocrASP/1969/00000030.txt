Rather than shockingus with
our incongruities ’or expanding
them to ludicrously large
proportions, Feiffer whispers
gently but insistently in our ears,
not forcing us to laugh but
allowing us to. He is a modern
Swift, though considerably less
bitter, revealing with subtlety and
reproving with gentleamusemsnt.
Although the script for the
notion is almost totally from
Feiffer himself, the difficulties of
dramatic representation were
worked out entirely by director
Douglas C. Wager with help from
the cast. Wager was faced with
transferring Feiffer's two
dimensional characters onto a
three dimensional stage while

Organisations seeking Albany
State' students still could, as
President Collins has noted. rent
apnea in nearby motels and
conduct interviews in a fashion
similar to that now occurring at
Placement Service.

Those In favor of this policy
contend that the university by
nature is solely an educational
institution. Hence, students ought
not to be “badger9d" by any
organization external to the
academic community.

. 3. “Admit some recruiters . . .
exclude others."

A compromise proposal.
attempting to differentiate
between these so-called
“desirable” versus "undesirable"
organizations.

For instance, most students
welcome the Peace Corps on
campus whereas they reject such
companies as Dow Chemical. A
number of methods of selection
have been considered. One plan
suggests that we license only
.. . .. .n- 1-. .- Others
demand that a certain percentage
of students indicate interest in ii
particular organization before
permitting that organization on
campus.

Supporters of this course of
action see it as a reasonable
alternative. Students could still
take advantage of Placement
Service, without being forced to
contend with organizations whose
intent is deemed morally prurient
by their standards.

On the other hand. appallean
point to “selectives” doubtfull
practicality. They raise such
questions as: How would wv
define an “educational”
institution? Is there no American
business of any conscqucnixv
which does not contriliulv
indirectly to the war effort?

Secondly. they declare that any
selective policy would ill'
unlawful, being discriminatory III
nature. In fact. they assert llini
the American Civil let‘rlll's
Union has informed us that Illl‘)‘
will probably challenge Iilt'
constitutionality of any
“selective” policy that llll\
University adopts.

Although not binding in liar-ll
results of this poll will aid
President Collins in defining l‘iilnl
University policy on this mulll'l'

Collins has indicated that ill'
feels recruitment is basically .i
service to us. the student i)()tl_\
Thus, he commented tliilt llt‘ Will
be very interested to see il‘ we (iii

Collins. declines 
education budget:

by Gale McAllister

Staff Reporter ‘

Discussed yesterday at
President Collins" Conference with
Students were next year’s
proposed State budget with its 5%
cut in.funds allotted for higher
education, and the tri-faith
religious center which is being
planned for construction
sometime in the future.

Originally. the New York State
University System worked out is
budget for the ’69-’70 school year
to be $493 million.

However. after a cut by the
central office. a figure of $443
million was submitted to the State

Housing plans

from page 1

Quads, dorms. and suites will
be a mixture of Freshmen and
upper classmen.

Concerning room and
roommate assignments for the
’69-’70 school year, Mr. Seyferth
explained that for continuing
students the priority system used
this year will again be used next
year.

The priority system is outlined
in the Undergraduate Housing
Brochure 1968-69 and is based on
seniority and return to the same
residence hall, with seniors
returning to the same hall. and
seniors changing halls given
priority, then juniors,
sophomores, and transfer
students.

By March 21, 1969 assignment
cards will be made available for
resident students.

According to a memorandum
issued by Norma J. Edsall,
Director of Residences. “the last
day juniors and seniors may
return contracts will be Friday.
April 11, and sophomores return
contracts by Friday. April 18. By
early May. hull preferences will be
announced... .

“it should be understood that
students who do not return
contract cards by the deadline
stated for their class may not have
an opportunity to obtain housing
until the lndian Quadrangle opens
sometime early in 1970."

Mr. Seyfarlh also mentioned
that plans for off-campus housing,
such as pro-fab houses. are
postponed for next year. but will
be considered ugains some time in
the near future.

When questioned about pets
being allowed in the living areas
on campus Mr. Seyfurth answered
that because of health reasons
only residence directors are
allowed to keep them.

 

and was promptly cut to $406 _,
million which was the figure in: '. "'

the Governor's budget. I

After being out once again, the
budget for next year will be
$367.8 million which means the
University System will get only $8
million more than last year’s $369
million.

However. the bare minimum
amount needed for next year is
$391 million which leaves the
System 824 million short. This
University will be left with a
shortage of $400,000 which will
mean several things.

Basically President Collins feels,
“the quality of the education here
will be bound to be hurt."

Fewer library books than are
needed will be purchased. and the
student faculty ration will
probably increase form its present
13.5 :1 to an estimated 14.2:1.

This in itself means larger
classes, with some classes actually
being eliminated and even some
classes which are now offered
every semester being taught only
every other semester.

Even if the tuition were raised.
President Collins explained. this
would not help the situation
becuaae tuition money goes into
construction funds and not
operation funds.

Also, discussed at the
conference were plans for building
a tri-faith religious center on the
grounds where Chapel House now
stands.

This land is owned by the
Faculty Student Association and
if the three major faiths cooperate
in this endeavor then the State
will not, be appropriation, take
the land away.

As things look now, this would
mean that Chapel House would
have to come down and the land
in that area would have to be
leveled.

Paul Nuthe. a student at the
University. brought up the point
that already too much of the
University's land was being built
on and it is becoming a “concrete
jungle".

Also mentioned was the fact
that after tearing up the wooded
part of campus, trees are put
back. but in a very unnatural
way---in symmetrically even rows.
However. no solution was
discussed.

The President‘s Conference
with Students is held every
Monday afternoon at 2:15 in the
Patroon Lounge of the Campus
Center. Students are given the
unique opportunity to tqu with
the President ilnd air their
comments.
