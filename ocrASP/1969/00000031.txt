DANIEL HELMRICH’s debut pert-manor. at Page Hall last Friday

night was a triumph.

“V Dannie Helmrlch,'planist, a new
1 member of the music faculty here. '

The concert, held at Page-Hall,
was a triumph. it was the first

 time any concert has Ever affected
this jaded listener emotionally.

The piano of Dennis Helmrlch
was incomparany beautiful,
defying all magnificence. To say it

was wonderful is to understate; .

his playing was more than
magniﬁcent.

With playing such as this, to
continue to rave in superlative
would be to bore the reader. This
being the case, a review of the
music should suffice.

It seems to be the trend among
musicians today to schedule

New fifth edition of ‘Word’

emerges as successful work

by Robert B. Cutty

After two years of trying hard,
the literary magazine ‘fThe
Word," under the successful
editorship of William E.
Nothdurft, has ﬁnally emerged as
a serious rival to the
quartercentruy old “Primer.”

Among the more pleasing
contributions to this fifth edition
of “The Wor " were two
self-consciously literary essays,
the first being a critique of society
by John C. Elliot, IV, and the
second a book review by Dr. T.
Littlefield. A-

Elliot's essay, “A Modern
Faustas," was written with a
singular degree of imagination.
displaying a superior sense of the
logical meaning of words when
they are locked together in a
propagandistic string.

It was Elliot's intention to
condemn society for its virtually
ridiculous suprcssion of the
natural human drive for individual
fulfillment. His searing use of a
word as simple as “jade” with all
its variations is a clea 'example
of Elliot’s power with language.

Dr. Littlefield’s essay is a
sympathetic review of “Smut by
Candlelight,” a recent volume of
poetry from the pen of Harry
Wirtz. Littleﬁeld’s writing is
straightforward and objective, as
hé professionally discusses both
the virtues and defects of Wirtz's

polemics of Sylvia Barnard, three
poems worth. They are, of course,
terrible, displaying the qualities of
pseudo-intellectunlism, ritual
bombast, and an unsubtle mixing
of modern terms with antique
phrases.

Stimmerman describes the
shock of loss by saying “I think
that trees and leaves are /blind
and only feel/ the sun, and feel
the wind tugging at them./ And
then I think they/ haven’t any
need to see.”

But Miss Barnard buries the
ruthless grief of war under the
banter of lines such as “The
smoke of burning bodies/ had
barely begun/ to gather across]
that vulture-strewn sky."
Admittedly, the lines may be
good and, even, thought out, but
after this same vein of emotional

style and subject matter.
Poetry Less Successful

The poetry is less successful. Of
course there Is the expected
perfection of (LI. stimmerman'e
two poems, both reﬂecting the
grief and shock following the
assassination of Robert Kennedy
last summer, but written in a tone
of calm, yet deeply sensitive
mediation.

And, there are the expected

exhaustion has gone on for nearly
forty lines, one is forced to
conclude that “The lady doth
protest too much."

Questionable Sinccrity

As for James Spain, his sense of
poetic style is so poor that, at
first, there seems to be nothing
constructive one can say about his
three poems. His diatribe against
holiday commercialism, “Merry
Xmas," is so devoid of any real
feeling that the normally stark
image of “Chirst...left naked" on
an “ugly framework” here has the
reality of a line as stupid as “Paint
yolr‘ toenails, sister." The anger
simply isn’t genuine, and the
moral falls flat.

“Paola’s Escape" is riddled with
so much insincerity that one is
forced to ask if it is Spain's chief
style of composition. “0 spirit,
was that your soul or mine?" he
asks, after a badly-described
sexual encounter. Who cares?

Most disappointing is "Amice"
because it almost succeeds at
evoking a response from the
reader. But for the simplicity of
“Scothched-grained pals” there is
the nonsense of “The back-up
man/ Who willingly dics/ For you/
Yet hasn‘t enough guts/ To face]
jo,se?f:: and "Footpowder’s
always needed] And saddle soap’s
a must.”

Happily enough, a four-page
epic of the soul's development,
“Fragments from Flcigend,” by
Spencer Rathus, proves to be one
of the most satisfying and
readable works in the entire
magazine. Rathus makes this
Joyce-like search for the origins of
his conciousness as an intense and
moving drama of growth and
perception. His use of imagery is
so mature as to seem entirely
effortless and natural.

Primer Alumnus

Among the more brilliant of
the several short poems that
appear are Daryl Lynne Wager's
emotional and haunting
“Lumentation for an Unknown
Love" (previously published in
the Fall ‘Primer'). Its five lines are
so perfect that they would be
deserving of complete
reproduction in this review,

Another Primer alumnus is R.
Christopher Cooper whose brief,
delightful poem mixes the reverie

of love with the apathy 'of a
French class. Also worthy of
notice is a poem by Gregory
Spear. This lyric evokes the
pleasure of love and the
fulfillment of the individuality of
the "I" merging into the more
exciting meaning of the “we.”
Magnificent Photography
But above and beyond
everything else. what has really
made this "Word" assuccessful as
it is the magnificent photography
by Steven Label. The photo used
as a backdrop for Cooper's poem
is a living, quiet nature study, in
which every tree and leaf seems to

' have an individual color, while the

tone of the sky, drenched with
bright sunlight, is absolutely
perfect.

An earlier picture, rervingas an
accompaniment for W:.ger’s poem,
details the face of a girl, in which
every strand of hair is caught by
the camera. 'The photographic
essay, “Mary,” is a beautiful and
timeless portrait of innocence;
every shade of black, white, and
grey is present in the photo.

and a piece which featuredaa'any

brought out perfectly. ‘ ,

Following this was the Tocatta,
op. 'I; also of Schumann's. The
virtuoso contrapuntal writing of
this piece was handled
superbly-all voices shining out
with bold clarity. To both these,
pieces, the audience responded
warmly.

Then came, for me, the high
point of the evening. Using his
extremely light touch. he offered
superb performances of Debuaey’e
“Btampee.” This series of three
pieces is based on engravings, and
one of them, a Chinese print,
“Pagodea” even used an oriental
four note scale.

This piece was given a
thoughtful performance, yet one
quite different from the one I was
used to. I must that his
performance won me over to his
side, especially the way he played
the series of fast runs at the end
‘of the piece.

The second of the series, “La
Soiree darts Grenade" was
supposed to be a snappy Spanish
dance in tango rhythm. Rhythm it
had, but it was about as Spanish.
as bagels. Nevermind that though.
That is the fault of Debuuy, not
Helmrich. His lively performance

best. It featured the ascending

the same idea held and sustained
for five minutes.

The audience reaction was

applauded Mr. Helmricha ability
to perform such a piece,*even if
they did not understand the
music. ,

For an encore, he performed
the Brahms Intermezzo in e

performance of this was
responded to warme by the large
enthusiastic audience. All in all,
the evening was a complete
triumph for Dennis Helmrich.
