Describing greatness is a difficult task. To be appreciated, a great
athlete must be seen over a period of time. Rich Margison’s three year
career at Albany State has treated area basketball to a rare treat to be
sure.

Bambi’s records are numerous and impressive enough. (Where do I
start?) He presently ranks second on Albany‘s all-time scoring list with
1334 points. He has scored in double figures in every varsity game
during his career--a record 64 straight games. He has made the ECAC
Division 2 All-Star team five out-of the last six weeks (Division 2
means only that we don't compete for all-star berths with UCLA.).
Further, he is four baskets away from the three-year varsity record for
ﬁeld goals. Need 1 go on?

The list of statistics are impressive, but no more so than many stars
today. But, greatness is more than individual records. Richie possesses
more than those records. Who will forget the numerous games he won
wrth last second shots. Moreover, he is the leader, bar no one, of the
Great Danes. He is listened to by big and small alike.

There are also the the traits that he would have if he had never seen
a basketball. He possesses a rare quality among successful athletes-urn
honest sense of modesty. It is seen in his inconspicuous manner
everywhere. It is manifest in how the “impartial” referee actually
hates to call fouls against the tall, thin Margison.

Rlch Margison will play his last home game tonight against a very
good Oswego team. Several things loom imminent. He is 32 points
sway frlom an all-time record for scoring. He is, as was stated
prevrous y, near another record or two. Most importantly though

Seniors To Play

The Great Danes, seemingly
looking towards their NCAA
competition, were upset thb past
weekend by New Paltz by a score
of 64-59.

The Albany squad played one
of its worst games of the year as
they hit on only eleven of
twenty-three foul shots.

itich Margison, however, set. a
school record as he scored
twenty-two points and thus
scored in double figures for the
sixty-fourth consecutive game of
his variety career. With this game,
Margison broke Gary Holloway’s
recored (56-58).

In addition to Margison’s
twenty-points, Jack Jordan added
twelve and Scott Price ten. Price
also led the Danes in rebounding
as grabbed fifteen balls off the
boards.

The Danes go up against
Oswego tonight in their last home
game of the year and the last
home game in the careers of Rich
Margiaon, Scott Price and Him
Caverly. All three of these men
have been starters throughout the
year and have contributed
immeasureably to the success of
the squad this year.

Margison, who has been one of
the most outstanding players in
the history of the school, needs
thirty-two points in tonight's
game to break the overall scoring
record for a three-year varsity
career. In addition, Rich needs
only four baskets to break the
record for most career field goals.

Margiaon is going into tonight's
game with credentials which
would impress even the least
interested basketball fan. Over the
course of the first twenty-one
games, he has hit on 76.6 percent
of his free-throws and 49.9
percent of his ﬁeld goal attempts.

Sophomore Jack Jordan has led

Last Game In

the team throughout the year in
reboudning, averaging 8.9 a game
and has contributed the second
highest average, 12.9 a game.
Scott Price, who has been
repeatedly called upon to guard
men three or four inches taller
than he, has contributed 11.6
points per game while Jim
Caverly, who has been a defensive
stalwart has scored at a 5.3 clip
for the season.

Following tonight's game the
Danes go to LeMoync this
Saturday where they will compete
in the NCAA Tournament on
Friday and Saturday."0n Friday
at seven pm the Danes will face
Wagner College, a team who
sported a 16-6 recored thorugh
their game with Hofstra,

It is difficult to judge how well
Albany will do against Wagner as
they have not played any of the
teams on the Dane ’s schedule.
Wagner's record, through the
Hofstru game reads as follows:
Beat Moravian, 111-83
Beat Upsala, 100-78
Beat Kings Point, 104-86
Beat Lycoming, 119-113

AMIA Playoffs

The second round of the AMIA
basketball season began Sunday
with its round robin tournament.
Of the many independent and
fraternity teams which competed
in the first round, 28 qualified for
the play-offs.

In League I action, Jim
Musterson's 16 points and fine
overall play by Howie Smith and
George Webb led Potter to a
56-39 victory over UFS. in the
other game, APA was defeated by
the Bruins, 42-40.

Dave Wheeler paced the latter
with twelve points. The results of
these two encounters leaves the
Bruins and Potter in u flirt-footed
tie for first place, both having lost
but one game.

In League ii play, the Brothers
kept rolling along defeating S’I‘B
by a score of 43-31 as John
Benson led them in scoring with
12 points. In other games, TXO

Matmen Finish 1-9 Season But
Individ. Performances Stand Out

The Albany State varsity
wrestling squad closed out a
disappointing season with a 41-0
loss to Cortland last Saturday.
The setback gave the Dane
maimen a 1-9 final record for the
year.

Saturday's contest figured to be
a tough one, against a perenially
rough Cortland squad. It turned
out to be a one sided affair, with
Cortland taking every match. In
the 137 pound competition, John
Furnkrantz of Cortland foiled
Fran Weal's bid for an undefeated
season by outpointing him by
11-7.

The 160 pound match saw
Craig Springer looking for the
twenty third win of his college
career. His hopes were ended
when he suffered a head injury
that temporarily knocked him
unconcious. The injury occured

STATE FAIR

To all groups participating in State F air:

There will be an organizational meeting on Wednesday March 5
at 7:30 pm in llununllles l37. Representatives from every group
must be present and any individqu who is interested in working
on any aspect or committee of State Fair.

if you how: xmy questions, call Norma [usual at 457-77l8 or

 

clock, and Cortland was awarded
a full 5 points victory by default.

Although the Great Danes'
record for the season is not
impressive. the season is not as
unsuccesful as their 1-9 record
might suggest. Several State
grapplers turned in consistently
ﬁne performances against some
stiff compettition throughout the

year.

Fran Weal had chalked up nine
victories in a row before he
suffered his first defeat this past
weekend. Fran defeated a State
Champ, and cut off one of his
opponents consecutive win streak,
as two of his nine triumphs.

Early in the season, to Albany
Invitational Meet brought glory to
individual matmen as well as
bringing a gratifying second place
ﬁnish to the Danes as a team. In
the invitational Meet, Graig
Springer and Seth Ceely emerged
victorious in their individual
weight classes.

The one victory of the season
Albany did post was a promising
defeat of New Paltz. The victory
came on the heels of a coaching
change that put Bill Mull at the
helm of the varsity squad, and
hopes were high that more
victories were to come. They
didn't, and the reason why they
didn't can be summed up in one
word: depth. The Danes lacked
the depth which is essential to any
wrestling team. State’s lack of it
was enough in sev- eral cases to
cause defeat single handedly.
Because the Danes squad lacked
the personnel to ﬁll every weight
class, two or more matches were
forfeitedevery meet. in several
meets, the Albany grapplers took
the actual majority of matches
held, but the five point forfeits
were enough to turn the score in
the other direction.

In sum, it was a disappointing
but not terribly discouraging year
for Albany 's matmen.

Wait till next year.
