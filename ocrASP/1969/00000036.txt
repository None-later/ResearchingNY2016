'0. Since the number of credit hours needed to

graduate In the Schools of Arts and Science and
Business has been lowersdto 120, does this also

lower the 50 credit hours needed to become a»

Junior? -

A. According to Dr. Robert B. Morris, Dean of
the University College, 56 credit hours are necessary
for Junior status. Sophomore and Senior status
require 24 and 88 credit hours respectively.

The number of credit hours necessary to attain
the various class rankings has not been altered
because the current totals are much below the 30,
60, and > 90 credit hour totals necessary for
successful completion of a four,year program of
study.

devices sold in the bookstore?

A. New York State Penal Law, Section 17478
Chapter 685 specifies that contraceptive devices
may be sold only in licensed prescription outlets.

dropped, can the students who have already taken

speech apply these thraax credit hours

A. Again we consulted Dean Morris of the

‘University College for the answer. A Speech course

taken previously to fulﬁll speech requirements may
be used as a free elective only. The exception, of
course, being Speech majors. Speech course

0. H a student is unable to eat contract lunch on
a certain day because of class conflicts, what can he

A. The procedure outlined by Food Service is as
follows: go to the Residence Office in Fulton Hall
on State Quad. Take with you your meal curd,
Identification card and most important an approvod
schedule card showing your class conﬂict. There
you will he give a pass which allows you to eat

FRIDAY MARCH 7. I969.

Turned off    

 

Mme m at  Seminars ‘

During the week of
March 9 \the Social Confrontation
committee will sponsor a series of
seminars on drug use. This series is
open to faculty only at this time,
with expansion predicated on the
response of the teaching and
administrative personnel here.
Basically, the seminars will be
run to educate the. faculty and
administrators about the part that
drug use plays in the youth
sub-culture on campusf The
lectures are being given so that
many of the myths and errors
common. in contemporary press
repo rts, about the
psychopharmacological, and
behaviorial aspects of drug use,
may be dispelled.
Topically, the lectures will go
beyond the study of drug effects.
They will include analyses of the

moral and social concema which
have led to the current concern
over drug use in our society. This
information will be presented to
clarify our current position, not
to make judgements about drug
use

The seminars will go even
beyond this point, to explore the
meanings of drug use in the youth
subculture. "They will also explore
alternative to the present punitive
policy concerning drug use.

If the seminars are successful at
the faculty and administrative
level, they may be expanded to
include student participation.

The seminars will be led by
Louis Lieberman, Assistant
Professor of Sociology at the
University. Mr. Lieberman is past
Director of Research and Assistant
Program Director for the New

Jersey State Department of
Community Affairs, Narcotics
Program. He has also previously
been Director of Research for a
National Institute of Mental

’Health Narcotics Demonstration

Program, and Research Associate

for the New York Medical College

Department. of Psychiatry. He has
co-authored two books on drug
use,
published this year.

Continued from page I

1. That SUNY campuses have a
minimum of black students and
an unspecified number, but
substantially higher percentage of
Third World Students enrolled
this September. Also discussed
was a policy of “open admission"
for all Black,’I‘hird World and
white working class students.

2. That black studies and other
ethnic studies be initiated in
which students will play the
decisive role in formulating
courses and hiring practices.

3. That the State Legislature
announce its willingness to fund
such projects in addition to the
previously granted funds.

4. That the money necessary
for all these programs come from
the ....r " and increase in

the percentage of state income
taxes to the rich rather from an
increase in the sales tax.

Although the Student
Association is not a member of
the Confederated Student
Government, it sends
representatives to the conferences.
President of the Student
Association, Duncan Nixon, gave
his opinion on the above
proposals.

In general, he feels that “some

are good ideas," but that “they'

are unrealistic."

Of the first part of the first

proposal, he said that it should be
worked for at all possible speed,
but that five percent cannot be

reached by next year. But he does:
feel that SUNY should expand its ‘

present program for recruiting
black and Third World' Students:
As for the proposal for "open

admission," he feeléwthlulﬁit makes '

tolls

 
  

no sense. Just opening enrollment
to reach a percentage is unrealistic
and this isn’t the way to go about
increasing the percentage of these
students. The potential for work
must be considered.

Of the second proposal, Nixon
is not too sure, since he feels he
has nothing to judge on. It is av
little unclear what is meant by
ethnic studies and what would be
involved beyond that.

It should be taken into
consideration what contribution
these studies would make and that
there is no point in initiating them ‘
unless there would be enough ‘
studenls taking them to make it
worthwhile. He feels that it will
be quite a while before there is
enough.

Nixon said that there is no
harm in doing what the third
proposal suggests—asking the
legislature to fund these projects
and he supports asking them.

However, he feels it is not
likely that the legislature would
agree to give funds to programs of
this nature and that it would
probably have to come out of the
University budget.

0f the last proposal, he thinks
that it is a reasonable request. The
sales tax, he noted, is not the
fsl ,st' .way because it taxes
ey" yor'lre’ equally and is an
inapprbpriutc way of getting
money.

He suggested that if the present
policy oi" taxation was corrected
by eliminating loopholes and if
stricter limitations were put on
the corporations’ taxes, enough
money could be made for these
programs.
