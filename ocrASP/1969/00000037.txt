Rallies Highlite
Tournament
*Week .,
 fromme V

' Rallies were held beginning
 and have not ceased. The
ﬁrst began on Colonial Quad in

front of Delancey ﬂail, but did
not materialize into anything
larger. _ The next night, the
--would~be rally had a bandl'and
enjoyed much more support sag
upwards of 1,000 students
paraded from one quad to

another, ﬁnally ending up in front
of the Campus Center fountain.

The squad members left"

yesterday for Syracuse. They will
attend a banquet and get some
practice in on the new court at
LeMoyne before tonight’s game.

Buses will be leaving this
afternoon and tomorrow
afternoon for the games, The
Danes carry a 17-5 regular-season
_ record into the tournament. Their

Sauerpower

most recent conquest was the Photo by Mine;

defeat of OsWego.

With the sport’s eye on Dick
Sauer’s NCAA bound basketball
team, Coach Bob Burlingame’s
preseason baseball warmups have
gone virtually unnoticed.

Yet, for the past week, twenty
hopefuls have been working out in
the “upstairs gym." Calisthenics,
geared to the loosening and
strengthening of muscles, has been
the bqu of the conditioning.

Also, in the indoor facilities are
machines strengthening and
leveling one’s batting swing,
ironmikes pitching plastic balls,
and a newly constructed batting
cage.

The results of all this will first
be seen when the Danes open
their season against a new rival on
the baseball schedule, Stony
Brook University, on April 7.

A single road game against
R.P.l. and a doubleheader atV
Oswego will prime the Albany
varsity for its home debut against
archrival Siena on Wednesday,
April 16.

With a minimum of returning
starters, Coach Burlingame will be
counting on freshmen and
transfers to fill the spots left open
by graduation.

An encouraging note. however,
is that the fall baseball team,
under the guidance of Coach

duo

Burlingame, showed signs of.
ability, highlighted by its 3-2
victory over Long island
University, last spring's NCAA
district champion.

Furthermore, Rich Spiers, a
regular last year, but sidelined this
fall with a broken wrist, should be
back in shape.

A knee injury to ace starter

George Webb, and a leg bruise to

Captain Jack Sinnott show that
the team is not physically 100%
even now. Furthermore,
basketballer Jim Sandy,
Burlingame's only catcher, must
stay healthy to keep the team
going at top efficiency. ,

What's more, basketball .has
naturally interfered with Sandy's
baseball conditioning, and the
post-season tourney only prolongs
the delay. As of now, Spiers is
tabbed as the number two
catcher.

The seriousness of the catching
problem is further highlighted by
the fact that the varsity has
increased its number of
doubleheaders to six.
