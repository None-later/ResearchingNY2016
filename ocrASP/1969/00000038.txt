Starring the film are the two

outstanding talents of Anthony.’

Quinn and Oscar Werner: Both‘
give excellent performances which
make the film better than it might

have been. Throughout the film

there is a lot'of excess time
seemingly wasted on the
countryside and city that is
Rome. " ’

The- main story itself is
concerned with a Russian bishop
who becomes Pope. The film
opens in a concentration camp in
Siberia where Kiril (Anthony
Quinn) has been a political
prisoner for twenty years.

He is called to see the Premier

and offered his freedom on
Conditions that are never really
made clear to the viewer. He is
taken back to Rome by an
emissary from the Vatican (Oscar
Werner) where he is made a
Cardinal.
, The film continues and as fate
will have it, the Pope dies and
after a few insights into the
character of Kiril, he is elected the
new head of the Church.

The plot itself is not that
important; it is the "comments"
made in the film which are. There

on his work Mon.

On 'Monday, March 10,'at 3:30
pm the Art Council of the
University is sponsoring an
appearance by Philip Pearlstein ,
noted New York-based figure
painter of the current scene.

Pearlstein is a graduate of
Carnegie Institute and New York.
University, where he studied with
Sam Rosenberg, Robbert Lepper,
and Balcomb Greene. He has
taught at Pratt Institute, the
Universtiy of Southern Florida,
and Brooklyn College, and

Gallery, and the Allan Frumkin
Gallery-his present dealer.

His works can be found in the
permanent collections of Colgate
University, New York University,
University of Nebraska, the
Neward Museum, Rennsselaer
Polytechnic institute, and in
private collections.

At present Pearlstein has been
commissioned by the State
University of New York at Albany
to render a portrait of President
Evan R. Collins.

contemporary issues of our time "

are, overtones made in the
direction of the situation ethic
which are subtly handled in.the
ﬂlrn.
Oscar Werner presents this
'problem In the character he
portrays. David is a priest under
suspicion because of the books he

has written. He is a combination'

philosopher, theologian, and
anthropologist. He Isconcerned
with man’s relationship to man
and the universe. .

He is concerned with the
cosmic Christ and the
evolutionary process it entails. His
books are examined and he ,is
silenced because the “Church”
feels that even though a good deal
of his thoughts are profound and
worth while there are others that
are unclear and therefore
dangerous.

The other outstanding issue
presented in the film is the
question of poverty. This question
is incorporated into the film
through the main character of
Kiril. There is mass famine in Red
China and as a result, Chairman
Ping is ready to make war on the
Soviet Union and the United
States.

 

Kirll is , called upon as
negotiator-pacemaker. He goes to
the Soviet Union to meet with the
Premier and Chairman Ping in the

hopes of setting up conferences
that willdivert war.

The scene is cut just as the
Pope is ready to answer and the
viewer is left hanging for awhile as
to what the Pontiff is willing to
do. ,.
The anew" to this question
comes at the end of the film on
the coronation 'day‘ 'of the Pope.
He stands on the balcony of the
Papal apartments and addresses
the people. He pledges all the
money that the Church controls
in land, art ’treasures _and
buildings,.etc for the relief of the
poor. The film ends as the crowd
cheers this announcement.

The film asks what about now?
Although it is not a milestone of
cinema, “Shoes of the Fisherman"
is a good film.

  Voluntary armed forces 

suggested as substitute

Two years ago US. Senator Mark O. Hatfield introduced a bill substituting a voluntary armed force for

~the present selectiveservice system. The bill was not directly considered by the Armed Services Committee

and efforts to incorporate amendments in the Selective Service Act were defeated. The draft's continuance
emphasizes the inconsistency of government coerced service with America's concept of freedom. This was
the priniciple reason that Hatfield introducedthe Voluntary Military Manpower Procurement Act of 1969.
. This year, the chances of passage are somewhat better than in 1967. Major news magazines such as TIME
and NEWSWEEK have contained articles commenting favorably upon a voluntary military; President Nixon
guppom the concept as well as well~known figures from both sides of the political spectrum including John
K. Galbraith, James Farmer, David Dellinger, Milton Friedman, and Barry Goldwater. However, well-known
political leaders, economists, and even the President may not be the catalyst for ending the draft. In order
to move the nation it will be necessary that those who have fought conscription over the past few years
enter the discussion and make their viewa known. The present Selective Service Act will not terminate until
1971 unless action to change that situation is taken.

Portions of Senate proceedings are included below to familiarize you with Hatfields’ proposal. The
quoted material is from the Congressional Record dated January 22, 1969. It consists of Hatﬁeld s

comments to the Senate.

“President Nixon has endorsed the principle of a volunteer army; the Department of Defense has

indicated through-various , ‘

the «3
political, social, religious, and educational organizations have indicated

‘ ,, of this ,.

‘ concept; and numerous

their agreement .

A certain amount of this support has resulted, of course, from the growing discontent with the Vietnam
adventure and the largescale drafting of men for this conflict. The young of the country on whom the

draft falls so' _ " L'

, r for the
are reflecting their dissent in ever more vocal numbers.

of a war many of them feel is morally indefensible,
The minorities are also restive under the draft. The

Nation is divided by the provisions of an act which require what so many potently do not believe in. "

“I ﬁrmly beleive that each man has a moral obligation to serve his country, but he must be granted as
much freedom as possible to choose what form this service shall take Conscriptionmust always be the last
desperate resdrt in meeting military manpower needs, and not merely the easy way out, as it is now. There

have been periods in our history
when conscritiption was the only
alternative to destruction, but
circumstances have changed and
forcing men into service is no long
the only alternative in meeting
manpower requirements."

“I do not think there is any
question that the volunteer
system could supply the necessary
number of military personnel. The
manpower pool is increasing with
nearly 2 million new men
attaining draft age each year; The
total number of draft eligible
males in the 18 to 26 age category
now stands at more than 12
million. To meet necessary
personnel requirements the
military needs to recruit only
about 5 percent of this total each
year. Certainly, sufficient
inducement can be made to
attract that many.

The bill I am introducing also
responds to the main point of
criticism of the volunteer
force--that the system lacks the

 

necessary flexibility for meeting
crises. It includes a special
provision for the improvement of
the Ready Reserve and the
National Guard. I submit that the
volunteer force would be more

ﬂexible and, in coniunCtionwith a
strengthened Reserve and
National Guard, would be better
able to respond to an emergency
military situation than is the
current draft system.."

Assemblymay broaden

Flynn anti

by Tom Carey
Capital Correspondent

The Assembly task force to
investigate “equitable and
workable" ways of handling
campus protest is seriously
considering broadening the Flynn
Bill already passed by the Senate.

Assemblyman Charles
Henderson, Chairman of the task
force, has requested from all
higher education institutions
“Their rules and regulations now
in affect for maintaining law and
order on the campus.”

Henderson said that the task
force members agreed that the
provisions of the Flynn bill or
regulations to it should not be
“limited to just the students," but
also should include the faculty.

Henderson added that the task
force will offer an initial report
today or sometime next week, but
will continue its investigation.

-riot bill

Several Assemblyman have said
that they believe the bill that
comes .out of their house
will—"get the faculty."

It is possible that the task force
will recommend that faculty who
encourage or participate in
demonstrations that disrupt the
education procedure may lose
their tenure rights.

Another possible proposal
would be denying State aid to
private colleges and universities
that do not set and enforce
provisions to handle campus
unrest.

The task force may propose
that students receiving State aid
would be denied this aid if they
attend a college that has been
deemed lax on establishing and
enforcing measures to maintain
law and order.
