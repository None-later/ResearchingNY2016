“Our culture, our history does not allow us to

Our attitude, sh'e went on, directly implies that

“For this reason we should change our rigid

Roger Hilsman, former Assistant Secretary of
State for Far Eastern Affairs, went on to give a
somewhat futuristic view of Asia. ‘

He said, “the most potent force in Asia. now is
emerging nationalism and the determinations of
nations to control their own destinies."

There are limitations, however, on what the US.

“This war," he said, "is the greatest military and

immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops.

“Vietnam’s historical situation was against us, but
we’ll do better in Latin America" if the American

by Amy Gurisn »

President Even 11. Collins
announced the results of last
week's recruitment poll at his
conference with students
yesterday. ~

3‘01 the 3,002 students

Plﬂlﬂli'mlng. 2769 voted in favor

of In 0M" campus, eomtltuting
' 929th! the ballots cam-130,06“

Ivotsd for a closed campus; and

‘07. 3’96 mounted a selective

campus. ,

The Faculty Senate had

deferred any decision on the'
recruitment policy until the
student poll was taken .and will
reach their own decision next
Monday. ‘ ’
" Collins also referred to a note
from Chancellor Gould, in which
the Board of Trustees approved in
principle the belief that it is the
President‘s responsibility to make
meetings held in University
facilities known to the public and
press.

This question was recently
raised by members of the local
press during the recent S.D.S.
Regional Meeting, where they
were charged admission to a
meeting that had previously been
declared open to the public. The
possibility of selecting certain
members of the press was raised,
in view of the press' frequent
practice of misrepresentation.

The three categories of faculty
appointments were then explained
by Collins in answer to a question.

The three categories are:
temporary or part-time; term, for
1, 2, or 3 years; and tenure, or
continuing appointment. A
faculty member who is granted
tenure maintains his position
“without limit of time."

Youth fare

It is virtually impouthe to
remove someone ‘with tenure,

unless he is charged with “pogr

immorality. gross
incompetetancy, or
insubordinatlon," charges which
can rarely be proven or enforced.

The purpose of the Security
Police was questioned in
connection with recent thefts in a
girls' dorm. Collins stated that the
primary purpose of the police is

the “protection of the members -

of this community." ,
The security force lree
outsiders from the dorms where
they may be after "pocketbooks
or something they consider more

valuable."

The conference was concluded
with congratulatory remarks to
the newly elected MYSKANIA
members and to the basketball
team.

'AlcohOl,new hours

go on to Council '

by Anita Thayer

The new campus alcohol policy
and the revised open house policy
Were approved by Student Affairs
Council Friday afternoon in
substantially the same form
previously approved by LACC and
Central Council.

These proposals will be
presented to Faculty Senate
March 17, and then presented to
University Council by President
Collins for the ﬁnal approval.
President Collins indicated his
approval of these proposals at his
Conference with Students
yesterday, referring, to them as
“generally, a thoughtful solution
to the problem.“

Basically, the new alcohol
policy would allow alcohol in
individual suites and rooms, as
Well as lounges, and the grass areas
that are considered part of the
living areas.

Alcohol would be prohibited
from the physical education areas,
parking lasts, the Academic

threatened

students petition CAB

WASHINGTON (CPS)--The
Campus Americans for
Democratic Action has petitioned
the Civil Aeronautics Board
(CAB) to continue low-cost
Youth Fares as rm experiment in
“third-class” fares for people who
could not otherwise afford air
travel.

The CAB also accepted briefs
from the National Student
Association (NSA) and the
National Student Marketing
Corporation(NSMC). The three
groups will represent students’
interests when the board holds a
hearing March 12 to decide
whether to abolish the discount
rates for persons 12-22.

A CAB examiner ruled in
January that youth fares are
“unjustly discriminatory" against
older travelers who must pay full
fares. A federal court had ordered
the board to open up the matter
after opponents of youth [arc
(mainly interstate bus companies)
brought suit.

Threc measures were recently
introduced in Congress to
continue Youth Fares. Rep. James
II. Scheuer (D-N.Y,) offered an
amendment to the 1958 Federal
Aviation Act that would make
explicit the CAB's right to grunt
Youtli Fares. (Opponents of
Youth Fares contend they violate
a section of the ACT that
prohibits unjust discrimination.)
Sen, Charles Percy (Ti-Ill.) offered
a similar bill in the Senate, and
Rep. Arnold Olsen )D-Mont.)
i n t r o d u c e d u
"snoso-ol‘=thc-Congress"
resolution that says Youth Fares
arc in keeping with the ACT's
intent.

NSA argues in its brief that
Congress should be glycn a chance

before Youth Fares are abolished.

Campus ADA contends in its
brief that the nation has not
achieved the “adequate,
economical service at reasonable
charges" that the 1958 ACT
sought from US. Airlines. While
travel is a necessity today, air
transportation “remains a luxury
which most Americans can ill
afford," it argues.

Striking down Youth Fares on
the supposition that Congress
outlawed it by a general
prescription of "unjust
discrimination” would be an
"anomaly," the petition says.
“Standby service at a lower cost is
the essence of social” justice, not
injustice.”

For the one-half discount,
Youth Fare travelers must travel
on a stand-by basis, that is,
without a reservation. (Some
airlines do offer guaranteed seats
at a one-third disocutn.)

Podium, and adjacent areas,
U—Lounges, and one lounge in
each Alumni Quad dormitory.

The proposed revisal of the
residence hall regulations would
give the residents of each hall the
responsibility for determining
their own policies and hours in
reference to visitation in
accordance with guidelines set by
LAAC. ‘

The , adoption of these
proposals will be another stage in
the liberalization of the
University’s living policies.
Recently, there have been
continual revisions and changes
which have acknowledged the
capability of the student to
assume responsibility for his own
actions.

These changes include: the
elimination of all curfcws, the
elimination of mandatory
signout, the adoption of a closed
door policy during open houses
and visitations, and the 1967
alcohol policy which first
permitted alcohol on campus.

The proposed alcohol policy as
passed by Student Affairs Council
includes the following points:

I. Students be allowed to
purchase, possess, and consume
alcohol on an individual or group
basis within the limits of the law,
and as specified in the following
sections.

II. Alcohol be allowed in the
folloing parts of the living areas:
in individual suites and rooms, in
the section lounges, in the lobby
and hail lounges, in the Flagrooms
and Cafeterias, on the grass areas
that are considered part of the
living areas.

III. Alcoholic beverages shall be
excluded from the following
areas: U-Lounges, one lounge in
each Alumni Quad dormitory.

IV. The residents of the
individual residence units may
prohibit alcohol-in any of the
abovo-mentioncd areas except in
the individual suites and rooms by
a two-thirds vote of all students.

V. Violations of this Alcohol
Policy shall be referred to the
appropriate judicial body.

. An educational system shall
be established by LACC to inform
students of the responsibilities
they will have.

Marxist Novack
speaks next week

George Novack, noted Marxist
historian, will speak Tuesday,
March 18, on REFORM AND
REVOLUTION IN AMERICAN
HISTORY. He will speak at 8
pm. in the 0.0. Ballroom. A
question and answer period will
follow.

Mr. Novack has been a political
activist all his life. In past years,
he has championed causes which
are now part of American and
world history. Following are a few
examples.

During the 1920-27 period, he
helped organize the unsuccessful
defense against the execution of
Sacco and Vanzetti, the two
anarchists convicted of murder
despite much doubtful evidence.
Formcr Supreme Court Justice
Felix Frankfurter and others also
entered the fight to prevent the
conviction.

In 1937, be convinced John
Dewey to establish the

International Commission of
Inquiry into the Moscow Trials.
The resulting investigation cleared
Leon Trotsky of charges brought
against him by Stalin.

In 1940, Novack headed the
defense for the eighteen Socialist
workers Party members convicted
under the Smith Act. This was the
ﬁrst of many actions challenging
the legality of the bill.

During the 1950's, he worked
against the rising fanaticism
caused by Senator Joseph
McCarthy. In recent years. Mr.
Novack, has devoted himself to
scholarship, writing, and lecturing.
He has spoken at Yale, Berkeley,
M.I.T., Harvard, Chicago,
Michigan, and many other
schools. Some of his better known
books are: ‘Existentialism Versus
Marxism" (1966), “Development
of Empiricism’f (1969), “Moscow
Versus Peking" (1963), and “Who
Will Change the World?" (1961).
