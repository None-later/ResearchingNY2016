Is America Becoming
A Militaristic Society?

The answer was obvious to all present, even before the panelists
began discussion. Anyone who had the desire to ’attend something
billed as the “First National Convocation 0n the Challenge of
Building Peace," paying prices ranging from $10 (for students) to $50
and upwards to attend a luncheon at the NY Hilton, was going to
answer in the affirmative to the question “Is America Becoming A
Militaristic Society?"

The interest that this discussion was to generate lit. in its four
major panelists, with their widely divergent backgrounds and
approaches. There was Seymour Mehlman of Columbia University;
professor of Industrial management; a man attacking the immenseness
and the power of the “killing industry" in this nation which has
brought us to a point where we now control weapons capable of
“annihilating the world’s population thirty times over."

There was Floyd McKissick, a former director of CORE-"first and
foremost a black man, and concerned with a society in which the

black man “was the victim”... a society which allowed the creation of
a Military-Industrial Complex which McKissick asserted was a “racist
concept" by the white man, who visioned himself as "savior to a

Howard Zinn

Professor of government at Boston University,
Howard Zinn was the last and most emotional

panelist to analyse the whole mess.

He could not understand the American desire to
gather in conferences to promote change.

“Such conferences, as the one in which we are
now participating, dull the intensity of feeling we
should have about the condition of the world.

“Where we have gone wrong in the past was in
the inability to see how really bad it was. When we

ﬁnally do see, it is always too late.

“We areth beginning to see the explosions that

Although Zinn's voice was low and his words
halting, his intense emotional involvement with
what he was saying was striking.

“The cry of the poor,

colored world."

Then there was Prof. Kenneth Boulding of the
University of Colorado, who informed us that
America was not becoming a militaristic society.
“We've been one since our birth as a nation. We were
conceived in violence and militarism led us through
the early years.”

'Paul Booth, young and hopeful, also contributed.
He saw the U. S.’ military establishment being
attacked by both the New Left and the Black
Militants—and he saw this as a move away from the
vast complex’s growth.

The panel, one of the morning’s concurrent panels
at The Hilton, was chaired by John Gilligan,
unsuccessful “dovish” candidate for U.S. Senate from
Ohio last year. It was dominated by the overpowering
presences of McKissick and Mehlman-two men
intense in their views; two men adamant in their
positions.

McKissick dwelt upon the racism he saw as so
blatant in every aspect of American history and
warfare. In a somewhat rambling presentation, he
nevertheless captured complete attention of an
audience somewhat aghast at his views, yet absorbed
in his delivery. The Vietnam War was simply another
example of “the white men’s view of superiority."
The Black in America would get nothing, he decried,
until “you stop killing my brother over in Southeast
Asia." Be it the Indiana or the Black Man or the
Indonesian or the Japanese, the white feeling of
superiority was going to express itself violently, he
felt.

Mehlman asked all those present to examine the
coat of a war-like nation’s preparations for greater
and greater annihilation capabilities and told us that
“To continue as we are now is to take the High Road
to the End of the World—World War 111." He decried
the stupidity of the ABM system, and the immense
cost it would entail. He spat out his disdain for
Senator Russell of Georgia—who, according to
Mehlman in the Senate debate on ABM had said, “If
there is to be nuclear war, and all but an Adam and
an Eve are to be annihilated—l want them to be an
American Adam and EVB."

Mehlman hit hard on the responsibility of the
taxpayer to say "No" to burgeoning military
expenditures by the federal government.

When a student in the audience asked Mehlman if
he wasn’t overemphasizing the role of lessening
monetary availability to the military, and ignoring the
basic attitude of militarism prevalent in today‘s
society, Mehlman snapped back “Money is power.”

The answer was so obvious that it didn't even
deserve its billing as lead question to a panel of
distinguished men. We all saw America's
militarism-and after the session with Mehlman and
McKissick, we were overwhelmed by its power and its
grip on America’s mentality.

and your brother.” So ends John
Frankenheimer's latest film "The
Fixer." It stars Alan Bates in the
lead role of Yakov, supported by
Dirk Bogard as Biblikov and has
to be one of the best films Ihave
seen in a while. Based on the
novel by Bernard Malamud it is
essentially a comment on the
suffering of man This Jobian
theme is handled perceptiver by
both the director and his cast but
considering that they are working
from a work by Mr. Malamud this
is not surprising. Time and again
you are given insight into the
character of Yakov us his
principles and beliefs unfold
throughout the film. You not
only sympathize with him but
you also are able to empathize
with his character.

I must admit that in the
beginning of this film I was not
impressed with it at all. It seemed
that you were being subjected to a
lot of visual violence without
being given any reason for it, or
furthermore, any depth of
character.

Therefore the violence became
simply an unpleasant spectacle.
But as the film progressed you
became aware of the character of
Yakov andviolence became less
repulsive. The many different
sufferings that he had to endure
ranged from the physical to the
psychological and to the
emotional. He was subjected to
every possible means of insult and
degradation to his humanity and
still remained strong.

There is an extremely good
scene in the film where Yakov is
seen lying in the corner of his cell
a mass of beaten flesh. A guard is

‘Promises’ offers a new sound
with energetic performance

by Fred Onufryk

The Bacnarach sound has hit
Broadway, and all for the better.
Although “Promises, Promises" is
a 'conventional‘ musical, it has
that certain sound which sets it
apart from anything else this
season.

The show, if you don't yet
know, is based upon Billy Wilder’s
movie “The Apartment." It is the
story of the naive Chuck Baxter,
played energetically by Jerry
Orbach, who moves up the
executive ladder by lending his
apartment keys to other executives

The most exciting aspect of the
show was the music. It could be
the best score of the season,
certainly better than “Zorba.”
The music has a best which you
don‘t just simply listen or tap
your feet to, but absorb and feel.
Many of the songs have varied
meter signatures, which bring
them out of the realm of being
common. Use of the electric
guitar and electric organ gives the

music an unusual sound seldom
heard on Broadway.

Jerry Orbach‘s acting was
excellent. His biggest feat was to
solo the title number while doing
a vigorous dance.

This has been the most
energetic musical performance I
have seen in a long time, barring
the deep characterizations of Don
Quixote or the M.C. in "Cabaret."

Jill O'Hara did a fair job, as
Chuck's girlfriend. However, I
find her voice unpleasant,
sounding small and squeeky, as it
also did in "George M."

Marian Mercer gave the only
outstanding female performance.
She craftin played the innocent
New Year's Eve pick-up.

Neil Simon’s book is not up to
par with that of his straight plays,
but it is certainly an improvement
over his last musical, “Sweet
Charity."

Most of the sets are streamlined
and effective. The choreography
was excellent. Aside from being

contemporary and energetic, it
was original, which I ﬁnd
refreshing to see for a change.

“Promises, Promises,” is easily
the best musical of the season. If
for nothing else, and it does offer
more, it has advanced Broadway
by its effective use of guitar,
organ, and ensemble singers in the
orchestra pit, all of which provide
its new sound.

“my name is Yakov Bok, a Jew ‘

looking at him through the door ‘ ‘
and says, “My God what is,lt?"
Yakov slowly. raises hii'nselff up
and repeats over and over each
time with more emphasis,"l am a
man!" Surely he is much more.
The question has been raised if
Yakov was a martyr, and if so at
what point did he become one.
If he was a martyr to
what was he sacrificing'himself?
Surely notto his religion. It is
made quite clear that Yakov is not
a religious person. He himself
admits it at one point in.the film.
Besides this there is the scene
where Yakov, after reading the
New Testament, remarks to a
guard that he understands
something. That something is that
any one who holes a Jew hates
Christ--they are one and the same
as are all men. All religious
boundaries are done away with in
his mind. So to what is he a

martyr? To his principles,
perhaps.
But. this is not really that

relevant to the film per se. He is
not made out to appear a martyr
but rather ‘a Man. A man with all
his suffering and pain, his growth
and failure, his thoughts and
ideals, hislove and his hatred--this
is what we are concerned with.
Anything else is secondary.

The acting in this film was
superb. Alan Bates became the
character of Yakov Bok so

completely that the viewer feels
with an intensity the suffering of
the person of Bok. Bates' facial
expressions, his mannerisms and
way of speech, and his reaction to
the other characters around him
all contribute to the believablility
oi‘ the Jew. Identification is not
really possible but empathy is
certainly not difficult on the part
of the viewer. When Yakov
imagines that he becomes the
prosecutor and imagines that the
person he has control over is the
Czar there is a line spoken which
pierces the viewer. Yakov tells the
Czar to strip because he has to
search him. When the Czar asks
him what he is being serached for,
Yakov answers, “mercy.”
Certainly an intense feeling is felt
by the audience at this time.

With regards to the film, what
can I say--that I highly
recommend it? Somehow this
seems inadequate..
