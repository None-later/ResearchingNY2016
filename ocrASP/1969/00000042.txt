RICH MARGISON is shown

going up for one of his last
shots as a Great Dane.

Rich’s Records

Rich Margison ended his victory carccr last Saturday night in
Syracuse and did it in true form as he scored twenty-eight points,
caused numerous turnovers, and scored the tying and winning baskets.

“Number 30" will take several school records with him as he leaves

Albany State:

1. He broke the all-time scoring record (three years) held by Don
Cohen ’61 (1,365) with a record 1,409 points.

2. He now holds the one season scoring record with 530 points.

3. He holds the one season field goal record with 199.

4. His career average of 21.0 tops all State players ever.

In the NCAA regional tourney, Rich was named to the all—star
team. He has also made the all-star team in the Capital District
Tourney for the past two years. He was on numerous All-East teams

this year and last and was named to the UPI "

all-America list this year.

As has. almost become
expected, Margison got the ball
for State. and sank a twenty
footer, tying the score. LeMoyne
took the ball out of bounds,
looking for, the last shot of the

‘ game. With thirty seconds to play,
a Dolphin shot went astray and
‘Jim Caverly, who had thirteen ~

rebounds, pulled in the ball.

This set the stage for Margison’s
driving layup with three seconds
left to play. Richie went to the
floor as the shot did not go in.
The referee called the foul and the
crowd was ecstatic. Richie calmly
sunk the first shot ensuring the
victory.

THANKS

The basketball team and
“Doc” Sauers wish to express
their sincere thanks to the
Albany student body for its
support throughout the season,
and, most of all, for its intense
enthusiasms in this past week's
NCAA tourney in Syracuse.

We’ve proved ourselves to be
worthy of the great basketball
team that wears our colors.

Just thanks!

 

 

 

 

Beyond all these records, Rich will be remembered by every sould
who saw him play, not only for his scoring ability and artistry in all
phases of the game, but also because he was a real winner in every

sense of the word.

The New YorkStatc budget for -
flscal yea'r "1969-70 . will be
approved by'the State Legislature
in thenntfew days. This budget
has caused-much publlctconcern'.

- and it threatens to lift'tho apathy

from SUNY campuses across the
Stefﬁ: ’ ‘ l 5 s "

. We must understand fromthe ‘
outset that there is nothing we

can do about the budget. There
are several reasons for
this-atoning with the way each
yearly budget is prepared.
Compilations of requests for
the 1989-70 budget began in

“Spring, 1968. For SUNY, for

exa'mp‘le, individual
administrations must submit a
budget- to the central
Here the total
SUNY requestf is prepared and
sent to the State. In compiling the
total for this year, President
Collins informs us, 550 million
was cut from the initial requests.

The State puts together the
State total budget which is
submitted to the Legislature by
the governor. This year‘s total
budget was a record high of $6.7
billion, including 3405 for SUNY.

BEYOND ALL COMPR EHENIION

The process of putting together
the budget guarantees that the
legislature cannot deal with it
properly. It takes up two large
columes when printed and is not
considered bedtime reading.

However, the legislators do not
really have to be able to read or
interpret the budget. The
legislator's interests are narrow,
reflecting the political and
economic interests that put him in
office. Most of the decisions are
made throught the party
leaderships and the floor debate is
pure rhetoric (just go down
someday and listen!).

The projected revenues for the
coming fiscal year are $620
million short of expenditures. The
governor could have handled this
problem himself, but rather than
face the repercussions, he put the
Legislature in the position of
having to raise the taxes and make
the cuts.

RAISING STATE SALES TAX

Rockefeller suggested that the
Legislature increase the State sales
tax from 2% to 3% and make a 5%
across the board reduction in the
increases over last year's budget.

SUNY's budget would be cut
by this. process. from 8406 to
$867.8 million, which President
Collins reported would be" 824

million short of 'the minimum

operating need. _
Studenta,. ,poor people and

working people have no chance in

effecting this process. They don’t

elect the legislators, they don’t'

make up the, budget, and they
don’t testify at the hearings. All
they can do is write letters-and
let's face It--one phone call from
the head of a local bank
outweighs 100 letters.

Nevertheless, some students
have decided to protect this year's
budget, especially as it relates to
SUNY. There have been plans for
a strike and a state-wide
demonstration in Ablany on
March 19.

Unfortunately the timing and
direction of the plans have been
poor. The Legislature, for one
thing is trying to get out of
Albany as quickly as possible and
may have voted on the budget by
March 19.

In addition, talk of a week-long
strike is aiming at the wrong
enemy. Students wouldn't be
hurting the Legislature by not
going to classes. Both SUNY
adminstrators and faculty will be
giving their support to any efforts
to restore the SUNY budget.

Yet something must be done. A
coalition committee of SUNYA
organizations is being formed to
coordinate activities on this
campus. Suggestions have been
made that a teach-in be organized
for Tuesday afternoon and
evening, March 18, with speakers
informing the student body about
questions related to the budget.

We owe it to the people who
are being hurt by this budget (and
that includes ourselves) to inform
ourselves and others about this
issue.

Fewer people write about the

"Vietnam problem'.’ ‘today.,

because fewer people read about
it. The audience, composed
previously of public, and students,
has about vanished; Both groups
have shifted their focus of
interest, the students to the
Oppreuon of Mankind, the public
to the students.

‘ A striking similarity can be seen
in another ﬁeld: who today writer
or reads about the "civil rights
problem"? Here too an audience
is lacking; and again, it is because
the blacks and the public have
altered their objects of interests.

The change, in effect, may be
described as one part of the
audience, the public,, becoming
more defensive; the other part,
more violent. The audience has
split. The active black shifted
from civil rights to civil disorders
and black nationalism; the active
student from Vietnam to the
Oppressors. The black switch
came most sharply after the death
of M.L. King; the student switch,
after the death of RF. Kennedy.
Tragedy ushered in tragedy.

In both cases, the shift was
accompanied by one common
characteristic. Both groups have
turned their attention to objects
closer at hand, objects which can
more directly feel their violent
energies. For the blocks have
shifted their attention from white

gociety to white people. And so
.too the students have shifted their
attack from Vietnam to people
nearer at hand. ' -, 

Both groups have [great deal
of logic behind their effort:, even
if they did destroy the audience.
The black, who hated his
condition, and who turned his
anger toward that condition, now
directs his anger at the people
who gave him that condition,
Similarly, the student, who hated
the Vietnam war, and who turned
his anger against that war, now
directs his anger at the people
who gave him that war.

Both groups perpertraied a
type of overkill. A black insists
that all white men are equally
guilty for his condition, since. all
white men are part of white
society, the cause of that
condition. And the student insists
that the President of the
University, etc., is guilty for the
war: and oppression, since he is
part of the Establishment, the
cause of the war, and the
Oppressor.

The shift meant not only a
tendency to overkill, i.e.,
irrationality. It also meant that
now that one can see the causative
agent-see the white man, see the
President, the policeman-~one can
strike directly at him, in a most
direct way.

promise to be the most effective-
way of solving problems, it
certainly promised to be the most
exciting, adventurous one. It was . -
 the easiest one, ‘for the
protector needs no ' longer to
think-«a a white face or an
Establishment face, and that is
where the anger is to be directed. '

The other part of the
near-entinct audience, the public,
,has switched it's interest too,
namely, to the protectors. It has

- become just a bit more defensive,
just a bit more fearful, and thus
just a bit more insolvent. It does
not like to be hanged on the head;
it does not like tones The law
Broken. So Mayor Delay shall
maintain his popularity, and Gov.
Reagan's, it is said, is growing.-

Thus while the public,moves
(again) from sympathlur to-'
oppressor, the blacks and students
move from educator to a second
childhood. The public stands
alone and in defensive about it;
the student stands alone and is
defiant about it; and the black
stands alone and glories in it. The
number of audiences, serving milk
and cookies after the lecture, is
declining.
