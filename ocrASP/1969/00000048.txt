. . ' Co’ ell passed a bill which could
 gha' unfortunateconsequencesfor

 
        
  

 

Abill, "Requests Student
 Council to. reconsider the
Open Visitation Policy, Section '2,
_ Real ' ce Guests 'and requests
' the , dorms shall be open 24
,hours each day, with the residents
of each suite deciding their own
. policy for the suite.” '
' Vic Looper, stated “Although
the bill may be' laudable in its
objectives it is at this time
illconeeived, poorly worded, and
ill-timed. Council either disagrees
' with or choses to. ignore the fact
that by current standards an Open
Visitation affects more than those
that live in a suite. In most cases
in order to get to your suite you
must pass through common areas
or lounges. Thus, an Open
Visitation inconveniences
numerous people living in the hall
and those inconvenienced have
very‘little to say in the matter.
"Another very bad feature of
this bill," Looper added, “is that
it makes no distinction between
halls and would madate that each
hall have a 24 hour Open
Visitation Policy regardless of the
residents’ wishes or opinions and
regardless of each halls
peculiarities or problems. In
_. comparison the LAAC bill allows
- a 2/3 majority of the hall to
~ decide its hours and policies of
Visitation and a‘2/3 majority of
each section to decide its hours of
Visitation.
“Under the LAAC bill a hall
and the section could allow 24
hour Open Visitation and the hall
could have as its policy the suite
l option. The major difference is
that the residents of the hall
would have an opportunity to
make that policy instead of having
it mandated. This makes the
LAAC bill ﬂexible and also
protects the minority which is
considered important both by
“N LAAC and the Office of
Residences. ”

LAAC visitation bill and guidelines

The following are the L.A.A.C.
visitation bill and guidelines that
are going before University
Council. Their implimentation is
dependent on passage by the

0. Any person not inyited by

'2. OPEN V’ISITATION POLICIES

The residents of each hall by a
2/3 majority vote of the total

I 3. OVERNIGHT

An overnight guest is a person
of the same sex who utilizes a bed

Drug documentary, discussion

not well received by

by Rosemary Herbert

“The Hippie Temptation” was
the title of a film and discussion
which attracted 30 students to
theDutch Qund flag room
Thursday evening.

The film, originally a television
documentary, began with Harry
Reasoner walking down a street in
Height Ashbury, conspicuous in
his business suit among the
crowds on the street. “These
people are hippies." was the
opening statement of the film.

The film went on to speak
about narcotics, but, as the title
and opening scene indicate, the
perspective was as related to a
limited number of Haight
Ashbury residents. Medical and
statistical data was interspersed
with scenes of hippies and limited
interviews. “The informative
aspects of the film did‘not go
beyond the common knowledge
of the average colege student,"

was an opinion voiced in a
follow-up discussion.

Three speakers spoke brieﬂy
after the film and then turned the
meeting into a question-answer
session. Dr. Hood of the Health
Center spoke of common diseases
such as hepatitus encountered
among people who have generally
irregular living habits. She also
stated that here “LSD is not our
big problem." Problems with
barbituates and marijuana are
more often encountered. Dr.
Hood answered numerous specific
questions during the
question-answer session.

Bernard Cramer of the New
York State Addiciton Control
Commission informed students of
the treatment capacities of the
commission. He spoke of a Cure,
Care and Control approach to
narcotic addiciton.

George Harder spoke from the
legal point of view, informing

. on proposed ‘

 

by Tom (hey~
Capitol Correspondent

With the poulbility on an
adjournment before Easter, the
Legislators are attempting this
week to hammer out agreements
on many major issues.

Governor Rockefeller’s
controversial $6.41 billion budget
is on this week's calendar. The
Democrats having released
counter proposals, seem to be
readying for a
ﬁnish."

The bills of Senator Flynn and
Assembly Speaker Duryea, dealing
with law and order on campuses
are expected to be acted upon
sometime this week.

Also, the polemic abortion
reform bill could be debated and
voted upon with the next two or
three days.

Of the political issues, the
budget seems to be the most
difficult to reach an aggreement
on, and the presentation of the
Democratic alternative indicates
that Rocky's budget may meet
with considerable opposition.

The Democratic plan includes
tax reform with increased taxes
on business and high income
corners, and an expansion in the
governor’s revenue estimate. This
program was formulated as an
alternative to the Governor‘s
proposed 50 percent increase in
the state sales tax and a 5 percent
across-the-board cutback to
balance his proposed budget.

Assembly Speaker Duryea
appears to be willing to accept
“selective cuts" instead of the
“across-the-board cuts." However,
on the tax question, he has not
yet set forth any definite plans.

[r ’ .mulating policy on this
question, Duryea must use
extreme caution, for the
