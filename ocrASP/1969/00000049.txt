End of.

an era
‘Lion In

badly

by michael nolin and diana dalley
THE LION IN WINTER won
the New York Film Critic’s Award
as the best film of 1968. It also
has been nominated for seven
Academy Awards. It should be a
great film; It is not. It'is,'perhups,
the most uneven film I have ever
seen. Its inconsistencies can be
seen in all facets of the
production--its script, acting,
photography, and editing.

James Goldman’s screen-play is
at times witty and bawdy.
Katherine Hepburn has one of the
clauic lines in the film. She is
telling her husband Henry II

Noted historian
to lecture Fri.
on Russia

The noted Russian historian,

Dr. Warren Walsh, currently
Chairman of the History
Deparment at Syracuse

University, will speak on “The
Bolshevik Revolution and 50
Years Later: A New
Interpretation" on Friday at 8
pm.

He has served several terms as
the president of the American
Association for the Advancement
of Slavic Studies.

Mr Walsh has been teaching at
Syracuse University since 1935,
While at Syracuse he was called by
the government to fulfill] various
assignments.

His publications, too numerous
to list are all concentrated on the
field of Russian History, with
special emphasis on the subject on
the Revolution and the Soviet
Union.

The lecture will take place at
8:00 in the Campus Center
Ballroom. Admission is free with
Student Tax, 60 cents without.

‘Fairy Tales of New York' is
the last production to be
performed on the old campus by
the University Theater.

Winter’

Over-rated

(Peter O‘Toole) how she made her
former husband, Louis XVI, take
her on a Crusade. She said, “It
was the greatest blasphemy ever. I
rode bare-breasted for the last
hundred miles. Louis had a
seizure. I got a terrible windburn,
but the soldiers were dazzled.”
Unfortunately the dialogue is
often boring and verbose. Even
some excellent camera work
cannot save us from the boredom

of Henry ’5 soliloquies.

Director Anthony Harvey has a
definite feel for realism in this
story concerning the ambitons of
three sons to inherit Henry's
throne. The castle sequences are
shot in Ireland, and are not the
white ivory towers that are so
often passed on to us in less
realistic films.

This could have been a great
ﬁlm. Director Harvey has some
flashes of brillance, but he seems
not to know what to do with
them. He often lapses into cliches
and tritcness. This would most
certainly have been a better film if
the zoom lens had not been
invented, since some parts of
LION are photographed as if the
camera's zoom lens were a new
toy. THE LION IN WINTER has a
lot to‘reconimcnd it, but its flaws
are too glaring to rccommcnrl it
very highly.

Hepburn and O'Toole give fine
performances, but the acting
honors go to Timothy Dalton as
King Philip of France. John Castle
as Geofi'rcy' is also iln excellent
actor. This fine acting is, however,
offset by the weak pcrl'ormaiicr-
by Jane Mcrrow as Henry's
mistress and the dreadful .
overacting of Nigel Terry as the
“moronic” Prince John, who
supposedly knows three languages
and has studied law. I

., As the program states, the
production of J.P. Donleavy’s
“Fairy Tales of New York"

I currently running in Richardson
291 marks the end of an era, for it

it thefinalState University Theatre
production to be performed at the
downtown campus: The next
play, Livings’s “Big Soft Nelly”

scheduled for May 14-18, will be
produced at the Theatre’s new
quarters in the Performing Arts

Center on the new campus.

Though among the last of the
University functions to move to
Eldorado, the downtown theatre
atmosphere has changed along
with the rest of the school in
recent years. It seems like a long
time ago that you could stroll into

- Richardson Hall of a Friday night

and see the AD's without worry
of finding a seat or paying
admission. But gone with the
annexes, the peristyles, and the
cave, is finally that ,always
over-heated little room where so
much excellent theatre has
abided.

Its final offering, “Fairy Tales,"
though probably not one of its
best, has the distinction of being a
play which had its American
debut as a University production
in the Summer of '62. In a series
of scenes, we see the American,
Cornelius Christian (who, like
Cnady Christian, harks back to
“The Pilgrim's Prgress), face a
number of American situations.

The play opens with Christian
having lost his English wife aboard
ship on his way back from
Europe. He is faced with two
subsequent ordeals: that of being
told (or not being told) how sorry
others are, and that of being
subjected to the funeral director,
who, like the stage director,
recreates life, and whose favorite
color is green which at once
symbolizes both life, naturally
and death, grotesquely.

Next Christian faces the world
of big business. At his interview
he says, “I want to make...
followed by a pause during which
the audience wonders what the
product is. But like Babbitt,
Christian wants to make “neither
butter nor shoes nor poetry"; he
ends the sentence with a loud,
resounding MONEY!

In the third act. Christian, like
his namesake, must fight a he-man
so that he can attain success, but
unlike Bunyan's hero, Christian

must lose instead of win, for he
counts on the generocity of the
victor rather than on his own
powers for success.

In the final act, he has
seemingly attained worldly wealth
and rid himself of his fear of
spending money, but he has not
yet completely conformed,
conformity being the other

necessary ingredient to success: he _

wears, in opposition to his
completely black and white attire
which he has worn throughout the
play, a singular pair of
peach-colored shoes. But he
inevitably discards these, too, and
conforms his dress so that he, like
the earlier Christian, can enter
"heaven."

Robert Clayton, who plays
Christian, is very pleasing in the
role. Either from habit or design,
he speaks with the accent
characteristic of Western New
York State which suits Christian’s
personality by its seeming frailty
and lack of conviction: the ﬂat
“8” makes such expressions as
“That‘s nice" and “Thanks” seem
to mean just the reverse. Clayton
also has a wide variety of facial
expressions through which he
portrays the various moods of the
hero.

New Musi
supports

By Holly Seifz

In the endeavor to demonstrate
to the campus just how wide a
spectrum can be encompassed by
music, Contemporary Music
Council was organized.

Seeing the basis of the
appreciation of music as a
personal thing, Steve Cooper,

president of Contemporary Music
Council, feels that “Music has
more ramifications than theory
class."

Uniting within the Council are
various bands among which is
Aman Ra which was featured
recently as an "event." This
semi-concert was the first major
activity of the Council and it
included a light show.

Although the group was
formally recognized about two
months ago, Cooper states that
the Council idea started over four
years ago.

Cooper describes the
interchange of band members

 

  

. authority figures are
played by William Snyder who
contrasting with Christian, speak;
in a resonant, commanding voice,

‘ Probably the best actor or the
four, he has no trouble switching
from the pier official to the
busineea president to the navy
admiral to the head waiter. He
appropriately dominates each
scene in his authoritative position,

John Koethen is fairly good in
the "friend" roles, though he
cannot reproduce an lrisli accent,

.,The parts for the single female
character are relatively short and
do not allow much scope, thus
rendering any judgement of Mary
Eileen O’Donnell‘s ability of little
value, though perhaps Sllt' might
use her short appearancm on stage
to brighten up more the 300nm
she is in.

The play IS worthwhile on the
whole, and really very funny, for
the humor which Dolilcavy
employs to put across his ideas is
not of the tragi- or black sort. For
those who have not been at
SUNYAroverlong, it is the only
and last opportunity to see a
University Theatre production in
Richardson, and “Fairy Tali-s" is a

gnificant conclusion to the

n

c Council

creativity

within the various bands as a
representation of the tribalism of
youth. He feels that many bands
are based on legal LCChlllf'iilllli'h
and that this fluidity of hand
membership aids in the
stimulation of creativity and
diversity.

Within this type of music
commune there is less Emphasis
on “mine” and more on the
group. Accordingly, the Icadi-riiliip
of the Council is equally fluid and
based on charismatic appeal

The next “scmi~conr'crl"
scheduled by Contemporary
Music Council is April 12 Ill l’agc
Hall. The theme is appropriately
“The Rites of Spring,” and there
will be four to five hands
participating.

Not strictly tied to one form of
modern music the (‘niinvil
encourages all variations from
psychedelic to folk and from
classical to blues. After .ill,
according to Cooper, “mum I\ :i
very personal thing."

i ‘Clear Day’

Cockrell’s

primpressively

by Warren Burt

Fora pianist to give a superb

with months of
preparation is indeed a worthy
fast. But when a pianist gives such
a concert on only 3 days notice,
his feat is all the more impressive.
Friday night in the Chancellors
Hall of the State Education
building, pianist Findlay Cockrell
did just that. Substituting for
ailing baritone Abd Fazah, Mr.
Cockrell’s performances were
indeed impressive.

The program opened with an
energetic performance of Bach’s
Italian concerto for harpsichord,
performed on the piano. Notable
were “his handling of ornaments
and his emphasis on the formal
aspects of the first and third
movements of the suite. The
second movement, Andante, was
highlighted by a very clear,
sympathetic performance.

Next on the program was a
selection of three pieces from
Ravel's suite, “La Tombeau de
Couperin.” An interesting fact
about these pieces is that Ravel
gave them very neo-classic titles,
such as Rigaudon, and Minuet,
but those titles, and the rhythms
therein implied are the only things
ﬂea-classic about. these pieces.

‘ Otherwise, they are
saccharine-pure sticky
lmpressionism. They also feature
some good music, by the way, and
some pretty difficult writing also.
With these, Mr. Cockrell pullcrl
off one magic trick after another,
resulting in an excellent
performance.

To close out the first half of
the program, he performed

Beethoven's Sonata in I“ minor,
op. 57, the “Appasionatcii.”
Normally, I'm not Beethoven fan,
rind for the first two movements,
Friday night proved no exception.
Even Mr. Coclrrcll's l'ini-
performance could not save this
work, which (in my opinion)
lurclics gracclcssly along with its

melodies and overdone tremolos
for the first movement, and then

bows to tears for the second

movement.

About the only thing
noteworthy about these first two
movements was Mr. Cockrell’s
bringing out of the famous ﬁfth

symphony motive which
Beethoven also wrote into this
piece.

With the third movement

hoWever, my ears perked up. What
magic was this?For even though I
normally despise Beethoven,
somethinghuppened here. It must
have been the performance that
made this movement come alive,
and come alive it did, as Mr.
Cockrell performed it with much
flair and dynamism.

It is interesting to note that
when he performed this piece last
fall, Mr. Cockrell drew his heaviest
criticism for his uneven
performance of this last
movement. i must confess that I
went to this concert with a critical
chip on my shoulder and watched
like a hawk for some trace of
unevencss this time. Happily,
none occu-rred. Whatever was
wrong with his interpretation last
fall was absent here and a
thoroughly enjoyable
performance was given.

After intermission, the second
half of the program began with
three pieces of com, the Gershwin
preludcs for piano. Now I likc
corn, especially when it's well
done, and Mr. Cockrell’s
authoritative performance
certainly was the spice these
jazzy, bluesy pieces needed.

The rest of the program
consisted of pieces by Chopin,
listed here because of their
number. The major works were
the Scherzo in C minor and the
lialladc in G minor. The other
pieces were the Waltz in C minor,
thc Prelude in I) flat, anrl the
Faritasic lniprompin.

Beethoven is not my cup of tea.
But Mr. Cockrell’s performances
made all of these pieces
endurable, and some of them even
enjoyable. A high point for me
came when he performed that old
warhorse, the Fanasic-Impromptu
at a speed designed to make one's
hair stand on end. Throughout the
concert he received the most
enthusiastic applause from the
audience and be rewarded them
with two cncorus, both by
Chopin. the 0p. 24 and the
Revolutionary Etude.

0n the evening of March 14, I ‘

had the pleasure of viewing in the
State Quad Flagroom State Quad
Productions’ . “On a Clear Day

' You Can See Forever," a musical

comedy for which the book a'nd
lyrics were written by_Alan Jay
Lerner and the music by Burton
Lane. The production‘ was’
directed by Franklin Levy, and
starred Ken Malian as Dr. Mark
Bruckner, Catherine Poluzzi as
Daisy Gamble and Melinda, and
Jeff Pankin as Warren Smith and

‘ Edward Moncrief.

The audience was really put
into the mood to watch a musical
when a chorus of girls at the rear
of the Flagrbom sang with the
overture, played by Susan Morton
at the piano, Gary Nestle at the
drums, William Bixby on the bass,
and Deborah Klein on the flute.
The overall effect was very nice.

The story is of a young woman,
Diasy Gamble, who is discovered
by psychiatrist Mark Bruckner to
have Extra Sensory Perception.
Her subconscious, under hypnosis,
reveals that Daisv appears to be a
reincarnation of a Melinda
