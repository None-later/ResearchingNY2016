AMIA's" [rejuvenated First
Annual Novice Wrestling
Tournament, held . this past

‘ . Saturday in the gym, attracted

more than 150 spectators and,
most significantly, 65 entries in
the seven weight classes.

Six years ago, a similar meet
was tried, but failed for lack of
interest. This year's meet was
patronized 'by several fraternities
as well as an independent team
and many unattached men.

In the 125-pound weight class,
John Davidson of “The Zoo
(Waterbury) won in the final
match over Bill Smith of APA.
Smith placed second and Mark
Joseph ﬁnd.) was third.

At 135-pounds, Al Stuyvesant
(KB) won by default over Larry
Fredericks. Littleton Smith of the
Zoo was third. x

In the 146-pound class, Dave
Jones of Potter Club won a tightly
contested match with Sheldon
Salzman ﬁnd.) to take first place.
Greg Thompson of APA was
third.

Denny Wyckoff of Potter won
in the 155-pound class as he
defeated Mike Hersher, 3-6, in the
ﬁnals. Glen Faden was third.

At 165-pounds, Jim
Nightengale of the Zoo took a 50
win over Royce VanEvra (ind.)
who \placed second. Randy
Streeter of Potter was third.

In the 180-pound class, George
Habermehl of Kappa Beta won an
overtime, judge's decision victory
over Kris Jackstadt of Potter.
Rich Ward of the Zoo was third.

In the unlimited class, Mike
Mueller easily won all of his bouts
by pins, beating Tony Caputo of
APA in the final. Jim Schroeder
(ind.) finished third.

ﬁrst half, ending the quarter with
a score of 8-8 and being ahead at
the half 19-14.

But Potsdam went ahead 27-25
at the end of the third quarter.
Then the visitors surged ahead to
an 8 point lead which Albany
tried to remedy in the last two
minutes of the game, but the
Tigers' scoring effort came too
late.

High scorer for Albany was
Senior Judy Mysliborski, with 11
points, bringing her season scoring
average to 6.7 points a game, the
best for the team. Seniors Linda
Lintz and Terry Lamparclla also
played well, especially on defense,
in their final game.

SPORTS SHORT: The NCAA has
voted to lift its restriction against
freshman players on varsity teams
in all sports but vfootball and
basketball. Pending further
clarifications and local
interpretation, this decision could
greatly effect both the varsity and
freshman sports at State, least of
those effected not being wrestling
which had a tough time fielding a
full team this past season.

These beechwood strips offer extra
surface area for tiny yeast particles
to cling to, helping clarify
the beer. And since these
strips are also porous, they
help absorb beer's natural

its ﬁnished taste. Or in other

Ah yes, drinkability. That’s

hampering both faculty and
students. It will encourage greater
experimentation and afford better
chances to select a major and
second field suited to the interests
and abilities of the student. The
present system and partial 8-1}
will tend to discourage this.

Total S-U encourages the
instructor to teach for thoughts
and seek out the opinions of his
students, instead of forcing them
to memorize mathematically
testable “facts” to produce
"objective" letter grades (such as
huge “C” curves in lecture
classes—the average student now
being penalized for work outside
his major that turns out to be
"only" satisfactory.)

Hopefully, this will make
students less dependent on one
major field and will, at the same
time, improve instruction across
the board. At the least, it will
allow students to put out more
for those courses and instructors
who really turn them on, instead
of doing only the “safe” amount
in every course to get the overall
C's or B‘s for which they are now
forced to shoot.

Concerning requirements,
students could take those courses
that really looked interesting to
them—and perhaps find a better
major, minor, or field for graduate
study than their present one.
Under A-E or partial S-U, the
student is really foolish to risk his
average by taking requirements
other than those tried and true
ones guaranteed to give him a
minimum C.

Instead of cumulative averages,
the students would depend on
recommendations. Complete S-U
would give every student the
opportunity of earning good

recommendations by doing ﬁne
work in at least three or four
courses. Now these students wind
up with averages of 2.0 to 2.7 or
so, and, no matter their abilities
and eagerness in their field, they
have had no chance to-earn a
recommendation that. will offset
the “poor” or “average” cum.
Good students, if they are good
students, of course will not be
affected by this—they will only
have more opportunities for great
recommendations. (If they turn
out to be not good students but
“grade getters," at least SUNYA
will have contributed
tremendously to their maturity,
and what more could they ask?)

Evidence indicates that total
SD is acceptable to, sometimes
preferred by, employers and grad
schools. Honest recommendations
and a chance to do some real
thinking as an undergraduate are
worth more to them than
recommendations of the “form
letter" variety and a transcript
which may mean only cramming,
foxy choosing of courses,
sometimes cheating.

Compared to this, a partial S-U
system is laughable. Who is really
going to be fooled by semesters
consistently reading: A, B, S, S,
S?!

We are presently witnessing the
loss of really good teachers at
SUNYA due to lack of funds. The
total S-U should improve
instruction without increasing the
budget. The partial S-U system,
however, promises little in
improved courses and teaching
methods yet the complicated
administration it entails will
require a great increase in funds,
probably staff.

The beauty of that
University (or even universe)
glows through the charged
language with a compelling force
as the visionaries proclaim an era

of “understanding, compassion,,

and toleration."

Being susceptible to the claims
of all those words, I am tempted
to leap onto the bandwagon
instead of reasoning my way to a
position that I can defend even
after the charge has leaked out of
the language, the shamans have
taken their degrees and departed,
and the rest of us are left
muttering Housman's lines about
waking in the ditch on the
morning after: “The world, it was
the old world yet; I was I, my
clothes were wet."

I have been invited to set down
some arguments for the present
grading system, and I do so under
two disadvantages: (I) the
negative in this debate is at a clear
disadvantage because the present
system has weaknesses that not
even a fool would defend, and (2)
the views I am going to state do
not completely or adequately
represent my own position on the
question. Having entered this
demurrer, let me sketch what I
take to be the raisons d’clre of the
system.

(I) A university differs from a
public library in (a) promoting the
acquisition of skills and
knowledge, not just making
possible their acquisition; and (b)
evaluating the achievements of
those who spend time within its
portals.

(2) An evaluation may be
minimal. "The required skill or

 

um. Inlw. cn.. anew. N.V.

 

  
  

     
  
 
 
 
   

 

New required skill or knowledge, there

may still be significant
differences—differences so
significant as" to warrant
recognition (“average," "good,"
and “superior").

(4) Because the university
engaged in actively promoting the
acquisition of skills and
knowledge, it wishes to encourage
all students to the highest rather
than lowest level of achievement,
and to do so in all courses or
programs.

There are, however, some
courses where the object is the
practice of skills already acquired,
the utilization of knowledge
already acquired. Differences of
performance in these courses do
not always amount to differences
of level or performance; they may
turn out to be differences in
personalities or other traits which
either cannot or should not be
evaluated in the same manner
employed in regular courses.

For these courses, then, the
most suitable evaluation is simply
a statement that the work was
acceptably done (S) or was not

(5) Evaluations may take many
forms; letter grades are shorthand
evaluations, shorthand " letters of
recommendation, intended to be
read individually and with
reference to the course
description and the stated
significance of the letters used in
the grading system.

(6) Students do not compete
for grades in any course where an
“A” is open to any student who
performs at a specified level.

  

 

(7) Grades are not rewards, but

acknowledgments. I

(B) A grade is valid (indeed, ls
only valid) as a sign of acquisition
of a particular level of skill or
amount of knowledge; the
equating of grades ln.s Grade
Point Average (GPA) is not a valid
index of anything definable.

(9) An accumulation of course
grades does not constitute a
liberal education. Neither does a
pass on a comprehensive or even a
set of comprehensive
examinations.

The Bachelor of Arts degree
does not certify that one is
liberally educated; it attests to
one‘s having fulfilled various
requirements which curriculum
builders hoped would make
possible (not inevitable) the kind
of inner development which
constitutes liberal education—a
kind of development equally open
to him who chooses to frequent
the public library rather than the
university.

(10) If u change in the grading
system would lower the incentive
to become “all that one is capable
of being," it should be opposed.

(II) The present system can be
improved—(u) by clearer
definition of course objectives, (b)
by insisting upon fuller
consciousness of what a given
exam measures, (c) by adding
other kinds of evaluation to
examinations, (cl) by rewriting
curriculum descriptions in terms
of skills and knowledge to be
acquired, thus subordinating
courses and grades, and'(e) by
making available even better
evaluations of courses and
instructors than SEC’I‘ already
provides.
