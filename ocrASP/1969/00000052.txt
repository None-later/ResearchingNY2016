Dr. C. N. Yang, Nobel Prize
winner and Einstein‘ Professor of
Physics in the State University
system, is visiting the University

today as guest of the Physics
Department.

As the Department’s
Distinguished Speaker of the
current spring semester, he will
present two talks, one in the
afternoon at 4 p.m., and the
second at 8 p.m. Both will be
given in the Anemny Hall of the
Campus Center.

The afternoon address will be
on “Very High Energy
Collisions," of interest primarily
to professionals and students in
physics. The evening presentation
will be “Symmetry Principles in
Physics": this topic and the level
of its presentation both will
provide more relevance for both
professionals and students in
other scientific disciplines, as well
as people whose chief interest
may not he science itself.

The Nobel Award made to
Professor Yang and Professor

which led to the dramatic revision

about symmetries in nature.

Panel leads .. discussion 
Pass-Fail. grading system I

by Kevin McGirr‘ Staff Reporter

“Is there any good reason why
grades should appear on a
student’s transcript?" asked a
faculty member at Tuesday
night’s open hearing on changing
the marking system.

After a short pause, Dr. Arthur
Collins, Chairman of the task
force on the Grading System,
stated that Graduate Schools used
grades as a criterion for admission.
Collins said that there were other
reasons for grades, but he wasn’t
able to articulate them at that
time.

Of the four panel members
conducting the hearing, Dr.
Collins, Mr. Richard Collier,
Academic Affairs Chairman, Dr.
Joan Shultz, Chairman of the
Academic Standing Committee,
and Miss Mona Kurtz, Academic

 

 

Standing Committee, three
favored some kind of Pass-Fail

system.

Collins argued for maintainance

of the present system with.__

modification. He said that a new
structure will not necessarily
change student’s attitudes. He also
added that quality education can
exist under any marking system.

Dr. Shultz's plan is for each
faculty member to decide and
announce in advance how he will
evaluate students. Shultz said that
this accomodated students who
desired the present system.

Both Collier and Miss Kurtz
advocated a universal Pass-Fail
system. As Collier put it, “the
present marking method
systemizes students, generates a
uniformity of thought, and allows
for little creativity."

 

 

The ASP will next appear on 'April ii.

 

 

Budget cut could cause

will be no money for assisting
next year’s freshmen and many
students will not qualify for
work-study next year.

Dean 0. William Perlmutter, of
the College of Arts and Science,
said that people should not be
misled into thinking that we
should be satisfied with what we
have and accept the budget cuts.

He spoke at length about the
inadequacy of our library and that
our present 550,000 volumes
should expand to the minimum to
two million volumes.

One pressing problem is getting

good department chairmen. To do
this it's necessary to have good
labs, equipment, assiststant, and
technical specialists.

He spoke of the freeze on
hiring teachers; even those who
have left are not being replaced.

It is not easy, he said, to work
in a developing University, but the
pioneering aspect of it is an
exciting challenge. It would be
unfortunate, therefore, to bring to
a halt new programs that would
discourage the best people from
wanting to work here.

sum. '

 

Collier said that he was against
a partial pass-fail system because
it would force students to
concentrate on A-E courses. He
also said that the present system
was too inconsistent.

There were about 40'student‘a
and faculty attending the meeting
and when a vote was taken, there
were 30 for a universal pass-fail,
for the present system, 2 for
modified system, and 2 for q
one-course-a-semester pass-fail. ' 

One student questioned Dr
Alan Kuusisto, Vice President f

Academic Affairs, about ,th
weight the current student
opinion poll would carry.

Kuusiato said that it would carry
critical weight, but the decision as
to how students are evaluated is a
faculty and administrative one,
and not for the students to
decide.

The discussion finally evolved
into just how much power does
the student possess in determining
his own education. A few, vocal
students bantered the panel as to
why so much of their education is

to announce how they will mark,
the students should announce to

In response to some objections
to pass-fail it was stated that the
initial transition would be
difficult, but time would be
needed to allow the students to
adjust to the new "learning"
atmosphere. One student
remarked that students might
float through the new system; it
was proposed that this might be
taken care of by comphrehensives
administered before graduation.

The question now is: if the
students want a pass-fail system
can the administration prevent the
students from having it?

He continued, “Under the State
I presented to the
Legislature, the City University
can increase its freshman class by
2,200 students to a total of
17,000 next fall as planned..."

Rockefeller said that now the
City must “match the increased
State aid" and if done according
to “formulas provided in the
law," the City University’s
1969-70 budget would be
increased enough to “clearly
the enrollment of a
freshman class..."

The Governor concluded, “I am

conﬁdent that the City can and

will meet its responsibility to the
students of New York City and to
this cherished City institution, the
City University."

Governor Rockefeller met for an
hour and 10 minutes with four of
the student leaders. The Governor
told the students he would talk to
the legislators in an effort to get
more money for the program that
helps slum students to go to
college.

The reactions of the
Assemblymen and the Senators to
the demonstration varied from
sympathetic approval to critical
disapproval.

Assemblyman Stanley Steingut,
Democratic minority leader, told
the demonstrators, “We in the
Democratic Party support you in
your protest against Governor
Rockefeller's proposed budget
cuts.”

However, Republican
Assemblyman Edwyn Mason did
not seem to support the
demonstrators. When one of the
students shouted from the
Assembly gallery “what about
CUNY," Mason cried, “Throw the
animals out!"

Assemblywoman Constance

Education Committee, said in an
interview that she was impressed
