Caverly was recognized all year as
the Danes’ top man in that
respect.

The Most Improved Player

> succeeds a

By Warren Burt

Monday night at Page Hall, I
witnessed an amazing sight.

Imagine a man, singing in his.

natural voice up thru the tenor
range, thru the alto, and well up
into the soprano. Yet, at no time
did he have to resort to a falsetto.

And furthermore, his voice
retained a crystal clear purity
throughout the entire range. This
man was no freak, but rather, a

counter-tenor, and a very good"

one at that.

Daniel Collins will be the
permanent counter-tenor of the
New York Pro Musics next year,
and Monday night he turned in an
excellent performance.

The program started out with
“Sound an alarm" a recitative and
Aria from Handel’s "Judas
Maccsbaeus." Noteable here, in
addition to the impressive sound
of the tenor portion of his voice,
were the extremely clear
enunciation of English-that most
difficult of all languages to:
singers—his good intonation and
his fine handling of trills and
other ornanwnts.

Next on the program were a
group of Schubert songs, of which
my favorites were "An die Laute"
and “Haidenroslein.” In "An die
Laute" a young boy exhorts his
lute to sing to his love, but not to
the neighbors’ sons because of
their jealousy. In this song, in
addition to a fine technical
performance, a mischeivous little
twinkle gleamed in his eye
throughout, and with nuance and
gesture totally appropriate to the
text, he brought out the meaning
of this light little masterpiece
perfectly. (In “Haidenroslein” he
again effectively used gesture and
nuance to bring out the meaning
of the text.)

The final piece of the first half
were some Rossini arias, which
took his voice to dizzying heights

   

  

llms‘ .
t  ‘

in the modest, and musical]
flimsiest, bravura manner. - -

Especially corny in these arias
were the accompaniments which
in piano reduction were even
more ludicrous. But somehow the
sound of his voice made sitting
thru Rossini’a musical creampuffs
enjoyable. w

There followed after
intermission some Purcell songs
for c o u nter-tenor and
harpsichord, in which as in the
Schubert, he brought out the
meanings perfectly.

There then followed for me a
disappointment. Not even his fine
singing could, in my opinion,
salvage the Bach Cantata 54,
because of the quality of the
accompaniment. I was shocked
when I saw such fine performers
as the American Trio among
others, have trouble keeping in
tune with each other.

As I said, this last piece was a
definite disappointment. For an
encore though, he triumphed with
his voice alone with a flawless and
simply lovely performance of
Bach’s “Bist du bei mir." In
addition to his firie singing, special
commendation goes to pianist
Dennis Helmrich for some
extremely fine piano
accompaniment throughout- the
concert. With the one exception
mentioned above, it was
undoubtably a fine concert.
