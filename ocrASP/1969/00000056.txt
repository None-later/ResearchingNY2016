Pass-fail poll, .inte.

Cont'd. from' Page 1.

I draw a third assumption from
the results of the open hearing:
with more thought and
information, more open hearings,
more discussions (perhaps within
class—some faculty have already
done this), the number of people
opposed to total S~U would
substantially decrease.

There do appear to be varlous
forms of total S-U that might be
acceptable and further discussion
could conceivably result in
formulating even some partial
system that would not totally
negate advantages of S-U grading.

These assum1...ons if valid (and
I believe they are) should be
weighed very seriously by the
faculty at SUNYA. And I would
hope to see more faculty appear
at future open hearings. Students
and faculty, many of them, have
objections to total S-U which
must be explained to their
satisfaction.

The results .of the ﬁrst open
hearing indicate these objections
can be satisfactorily explained.
Furthermore, the first open
hearing indicated that many
persons, who fully and clearly see
the evils and disadvantages of the
present system or a partial system
that retains these factors, have not.
been adequately presented with
the best advantages of total S-U
grading.

The most important next step,
then, is to encourage greater
discussion of the subject and
provide more sources of
information, so that the majority
of faculty and a greater majority
of students not only will accept
but will desire total S-U.

But there is another important
consideration. The reports of the
Task Forces and varlous
committees concerning
innovations and changes in
academic policies and procedures

  

are now beginning to come forth.
It will be easy for the sum of
these to bury the individual parts,
however promising, under the
accumulated weight. But with
pass-fail we are dealing with
something already desired‘ by
most students, something whose
good points have been
demonstrated already elsewhere.
We are presented with a lack,
a failing, the present grading
system and we should replace it as
soon as possible. I hope it will be
kept in mind that, whatever the
new calendar, regulations,
treatment of hours, etc. that may
be brought onto this campus,
none of this directly conﬂicts
with total S-U grading any more
than present conditions do. In
fact, with certain proposed
changes (such as the elimination
of assigning hours to courses),
total S-U might well be expected
to produce even more beneficial
results.
Further discussion may indicate

Chisholm

by Anita Thayer

Mrs. Shirley Chisholm, the only
Negro Congresswoman, and a
native of Brooklyn, was the
speaker Wednesday afternoon in
the Campus Center at an open
convocation in honor of EOP
students who have made high
academic achievements.
Previously, as a member of the
State Assembly she sponsored the
SEEK program. Her activity in
politics has spanned twenty years.

Mrs. Chisholm said “We
Negroes must be realistic... . We
are Americans in an American
society...We have measured
America not by her achievement
but by her potential....But there is

 rasss

 

that in part some other change

from A-E grading will be‘better, ’

but the discussions I have heard
(as well as my own arguments!)
have convinced me that, given the
whole picture, total 8-0 of some
form will be the best all-around
system and the one with the
fewest drawbacks.

In conclusion, I see a proven

desire, a generally agreed need, .

relative lack of
administrative difficulties
concerning total 8-0. I hope
everyone who agrees with my
interpretation will attempt to join
and overcome' needless
overdeliberation and redtape and
will oppose well-meant but
ineffectual compromises. I equally
hope that those who do not agree
with me will consider the matter
further, openly discuss their
honest objections, and then act
for what the feel is the best
interests of SUNYA and the cause
of learning.

take."

She continued by saying that
she knew that some will hate
while others still have patience.
Everyone must “do their own
thing.” It is not only a black
student rebellion but a white
student rebellion too.”

Mr. Chisholm’stnted her faith in
the younger generation and the
belief that they have something to
say. She believes that education
will play an important part in the
struggle for the equality of
opportunity that belongs to every
American. “The world is looking

Legislators pass budget

By Tom Carey
After eight hours of bitter
argument, almost unbearable

frustration and mass confusion,
the New York Legislature finally
increased the sales tax and passed
part of Governor Rockefeller‘s
$6.4 billion budget.

In one session lasting until the
early morning hours, the
Assembly attempted to reach an
agreement on the fiscal policies
for the coming year.

From the Democrats' View, this
session was plagued with the
heavy gavel of the Assembly
Speaker overriding parliamentary
rules, amendments offered and
ignored, frustration when they
were told to vote on a complex
20-page hill just placed on their
desks, and the refusal of clerks to
give members copies of the bills
under discussion.

As a result of the widespread
opposition to Rockefellcr's
ucross-the-bourd cutback,
particularly to school aid, the
legislature decided to seek
“selective” cuts in specific
programs.

Among the many changes in
the proposed budget, perhaps, the
greatest is the cut in the welfare

budget.

Much of the protest against the
across-thc-board cut was directed
at the reduction such a plan
would have on aid to education.

The Legislators reacted to this
pressure and restored $74 million
of the $104 million cut. in
education originally proposed by
the Governor.

To accomplish this and still
have a balanced budget, the
Legislators increased Rockefellcr's

proposed $51 million cut. in
welfare to $128 million.

The cutback brought
immediate opposition by the New
York Catholic State Committee,
the State Council of Churches,
and the New York Board of
Rabbis.

In u telegram to Rockefeller,
they urged him to veto the
legislation and immediately
reconvene the legislature in order
to restore the money to the poor.
