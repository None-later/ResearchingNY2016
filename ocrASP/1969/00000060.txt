meeting (before Spring vacation).

changing more slowly from a
small teachers’ college department
to a large University one than
other departments, she is excited.

Etudemit‘rom the most recent
information received, there are
over 1,000 signatures on each of
the petitions.

Rhonda says she is pleased with
the orderly way in which the
students are expressing their
opinion. Waterman beleives that
the activityof students isa‘very
legitimate means of expressing
their sentiment, a democratic
means. i can’t think of a better
way to go about it.’

Dr. Shirley Brown

Brown said that she “would
like to have seen student activity
more thoughtfully directed. The
petitions reveal nothing that was
not already taken into
consideration before the decision
was made.

“if the goal was to effect the
process" by which the decision
was made, "the students should

CGNGREGATION

 

 

"The petitions are irrelevant.
The process (by which the
decision was made) has taken
place; the decision has been
made."

Asked if the teaching
effectiveness is the priority factor
in determining such cases, Brown
explained that this was one major
factor. Antoher very important
factor for retention is being a
constructive department member
in terms of fulfilling the total set
of department functions.

It has been suggested that it is
the second category which was
not satisfactorily fulﬁlled by the
professors in question.

On the matter of student
participation in the department,
Brown said the only reasonable
course for such participation is an
advisory group (composed of
students) complementing the
established faculty committee.

Perhpas the increase in
communication and activity
between students and faculty will
continue and increase beyond this
particular case.

As a result, students may find a
way through or within the
structure to "systematically"
make their opinions and decisions
known and respected.

He speaks about his policies
using New Left cliches, “power to
the people, community control”;
but he wants the people of
Albany to have a real alternative
to the power plays of the
two-party system. ,. .

Socialist; he’s a

running against a
politcal giant.
He's soft-spoken and looks like
what people would expect a
Socialist to look like,” long hair
and a mustache.

O'Kain asks for some rather
moderate changes such as lower
the voting age and the election of
many public officials which are
now appointed. But he also asks
for taxing Churches, free speech
for high school students, free
medical aid, a referendum on the
war, and the end of police
harassment of minority groups.

These are the issues that the
voting public does not see as
clearly as our college peers.

Mr. O'Kain wants to
redistribute the power, from the
few to the many. He’s for
revolution, without violence; he
wants Blacks to decide their own

O'Kain feels strongly about our ‘

“brutal, outdated, and
inefficient." O’Kain feels that

One of his

possible, to be

As of this
writing he has

debate with Mayor Corning.

This Friday he’ll be speaking at

Philadelphia T.V. (WPHL) panel
discussion with Steven Spender, a
poet, on April 26th he’ll speak at
Page Hall during a Conference on
“Black Power and White
Responsiblitiy."

In the future he’ll be speaking
at Alfred College as well as on
local T.V. stations to participate
in panel discussion.

To achieve the election of
Mayor he has a long road to
travel. He will not be allowed to
collect signatures to get on the

While the new book will not be

‘ It is not often that the voice of
those who really want to' be
heardare given the chance to do
so.

Mr. O’Kain, needing 3,000
"acceptable" signatures in order
to be placed on the ballot, Will
probably require twice that
number inorder to allow for
signatures that are discounted.

It might be the first time in the
City of Albany that the little
poeple will be given a choice
between systemized government
and a real confrontation with
Urban problems. Mr. O’Kain says
that his,ultimate goal is “to take
power from those who control

poor, he said. Many people feel
that those on payroll are
“third-class citizens." Charges of
vagrancy are used to arrest people
on suspicion. This problem of bias
against the poor has not been
solved and exists in such areas as
.housing.

The problem of hunger is also
great. While people are hungry,
there are laws to stabilize prices
for producers by taking surpluses
off the market.

He went on to say that there is
“disemployment,” due to such
technical developments as
automation, but people still resent
the poor, who they feel are being
paid to be poor.

There is a false pride in the
