The third annual Spring Jazz
Festival, sponsored by Special
Events Board, will take place on
April 18th and 19th. Titled
“Synthesis ‘69," the intent of the
festival is to prssent a melange of
modern and contemporary
musical styles.

Friday evening, at 8:30 in the
gymnasium the Dave Brubeck
Trio will perform with featured
soloist Jerry Mulligan on baritone
saxophone.

After disbanding his world
famed quartet three years ago,
Brubeck has since come out of
semi-retirement to tour the
country with Mulligan. Brubeck's
joining forces with Mulligan
results in the combination of two
fo the major exponents of the
"cool" or “Post-hop“ school
which evolved during the mid
1950's.

In addition to being ﬁrst-rate
artists in the LP ﬁeld, both have
had hit singles on the “Top 40"
chart. Burbeck scored in 1961
with “Take Five" while several
years ago. Mlllligan's version of
"Downtown" was s top aellirc
single.

Aha present on the Friday
evening bill is drummer Elvin
Jones and his trio. Jones is an
avant-garde musician who, despite

the rhythmic, harmonic and
melodic complexity of his music,
still manages to speak the

sometimes subtle language of soul.
Trying to recall Elvin's
performance in jazz critics polls is
easier to recall than the times he
hasn't. won.

Elvin 's sidemen are of no mean
achievement, either. Joe Farrel,
tenor sax and Jimmy Garrison,
bass, are two of New York’s ﬁnest
as they play music that is the
shape of things to come.
Together, thue three are a
dominating force in the evolution
of the art form.

On Saturday afternoon, April
19. trumpeter: Clark Terry and
Arnie Lawrence from the "tonight
Show" orchestra will join noted

 

area reed man Nick “Doll in a
jazz worship and jam session.
Clark Terry, who appeared at last
year‘s festival with his 18-piece
orchestra, will perform this year
,as a featured soloist in a small
’group context.-

The Miles Davis quintet and the
Babtunde Olatunji African Revue
will perform at the Satruday
evening concert.

Doubling with Davis is Olatunji
and his “Drums of Passion."
Olatunji‘s primitive percussive

   

sound combines elements of
primitive African and Carribean
rhythms. However, the most
striking aspect of Olatunji's

ormance is the authentic
native costuming and ritual dance

Elliot to speak
on literature

Thurs afternoon

George P. Elliott, professor of
English and creative writing at
Syracuse University, will talk on
“Literature and Nihilism" at 4 :15
Thursday afternoon, April 17, in
the Campus Center assembly hull,
State University of New York at
Albany. His address is the latest in
the university's English
department lecture series.

Professor Elliott is a poet,
and critic. His latest
work, a book of short stories
entitled “An Hour of Lust
Things," recently was published
by Harper and Row. Among his
other works are in collection of
essays, “A Piece of Lcttucc;" u
nurrutivc poem, “Fever and
Chilla;" 10 short stories, “Among
the Dunguf’ and novels “In this
World,” “Pnrktilden Village," and
“David Knudsen."

The lndiunu nutivu wus
gruduuted from the University of
California in 1939 and received
his master's degree from that
institutlon in 1941. He joined the
Syracuse faculty in 1963 und has
also taught at St. Mury'a Collage,
Cornell University, Burnnnrd
College, the State University of
Iowa, and the University or
California. Mr. Elliott has
travelled in France, England, und
Italy...

Donald Mochon, director of the
Art Gallery, has announced that
34 works have been selected to
constitute a traveling exhibition
which will be displayed at State
University campuses through
December 1970. He said that the
convocation exhibit, one of the
largest ever gathered in the Capital
District, runs the whole range
from the representational to the
latest abstract expression.

Artists from SUNY's four
graduate centers, 13 arts and
science colleges, and other
specialized colleges, and from 24
two-year campuses, are
represented;

The cliff detail, a recreation of
a section of a bluff near Catskill,
by Manuel Bromberg, professor of
art at the College at New Paltz, is
one of the most provacativa pieces
on exhibit and critics already are
classifying it as an important
work. It was one of the 34 works
chosen for the traveling exhibition
by William C. Scitz, director of
the Rose Art Museum of Brandeis
University.

Dr. Seitz observed that it is
difficult, perhupa even impossible,
to make assessments about an
artist’s effectiveness in teaching
from viewing his work. “Yet I
cannot but feel that under
artist-teachers of the calibre of
those in this exhibition, art
students at the State University of
New York are in capable hands,"
he said.

A second art exhibition, lusting
three duys but starting one duy

Convocation exhibit

earlier than the convocation
exhibit, will be sponsored by the
Joint Awards Council of State
University.

It will take place from 9 a.m. to
10 pm. April 16-18 in the new
Performing Arts Center lounge.
