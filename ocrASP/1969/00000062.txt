Club opened its season -on a
. winning note this past Saturday as
they defeated the Mohawk
Lacrosse Club, 11-10.
After leading at half-time, 65,

5 the Albmy,squad won the game .

with a goal by Steve Jakway.
The most amazaing
performance came from Larry
Smith of Albany who scored ﬁve
goals and registered four assists.

Smith, last year's goalie, moved -

into an attack position this year
and proved himself more than
mpable of filling the spot.

Although Albany appeared to
be the stronger team in the first
half, the Mohawk Club came back
strong in the third quarter and
almost turned the tide. With the
score at 10-10, and time running
out, Stevs Jakway slipped the ball
past the Mohawk goalie'for the
winning score.

Bob Cole, who took over the
goalie chores this year, recorded
twenty-four saves against the
tough Mohawk Club.

Albany's team has already been
hard hit by injuries as a number of
last year’s outstanding performers
are unable to participate in any
competition.

Bruce Sand, who played the
point on attack last year is
suffering from recurring
mononucleosis. Mike Barlotta
broke a shoulder bone in
pre-season scrimmage against
Siena which the Albany squad
won 7-5. He is expected to return
before the end of the season,
however.

Another midfield man who is

p t _ . ' out for the season after breaking

his back is Walt Quillinan who will
be in a body cast for six months.
Despite this handicap, the
Albany squad won one of its
toughest games of the year.

if ion-My Mind

By BARRY KIRSHNER

 

 

it most. Americans (including
politicians) were suddenly
stricken by severe sunburn, they

- would probably paint their bodies

to its original skin shade and go
about as if the situation were
corrected. This would be
indicative of the American
approach to problem
solving-cover up the symptoms
and the discus wiiinolonger exist.

Professor Henry Higgins once
commented that women always
straighten'up their hair whilenever
‘straightening up the mess that's
inside.’ This is an applicable
observation of the superficiality
of American life. By listening to
the mass media it is easy to
observe our culture's value
system. A good person is someone
who can cover up both his body
and .mouth odor, keep dandruff
out of his hair and his face devoid
of blemishes.

This improvement of external
features is a significant'aspect of
the society’s working. We seem to
be overly involved with things
visible to others while not caring
at all for the 'mess that's inside.‘

Much time is spent choosing
clothes and making ourselves
'presentabie’ in order to solve
r ' 'social _ ' ‘ ,' where
the obvious solution seems to be
improving our own character and;
not our appearance. At present
there are a disgusting number of
human beings who ‘wear a face
that they keep in a jar by the
door.‘

Concentration on external
rather than internal features could
temporarily bring the appearance
of a solution. This solution can
only be temporary because as long
as the roots of the problem are
not healed, the symptoms will
reappear. Where symptoms are
repressed from appearing (as was
attempted in Chicago last
summer), the disease will
gypntually appear in a more vilent
form.

It is a" too common in this
nation that symﬁif’ms “'6
diagnosed incorrectly as diced?“
in themselves. Many Americans
believe that we are solving our
problems; we have built hospitals
to combat mental disease; we have
better trained police and national
guard to combat riots. What

actually does seem to be the truth
is that these problems are also
symptoms. The 10% of the
American population who will see
the insides of mental institutions
are not only a serious problem,
but a reflection of a diseased
society. The significance of voting
is not that a segment of our
populatin breaks the law, but that
this portion of our population is
desperate enough to break with
established authority.

‘Unfortunutcly many
manifestations of disease are
regarded as disease itsolf. When
Americans attempt to solve that
old problem of prostitution we
attempt to treat it as a disease

itself. What should be recognized
is that prostitution lea significsn
reflection of the seller’s lack of
economic security, and the
buyer's lack of emotional
security, reflections of failures in
society. Problems such as these
can not be solved unless the
diseased roota of the problem are
healed. This would necessitate
sweeping ethical changes which
have been long overdue in
American society.

It should be clear that at
present the problem solving
techniques used by this nation
have been tragically
unenlightened. The illegality of
drugs, the repression of student
unrest (as demonstrated in the

Flynn Bill) the use of tactical
police forces agath rioting will
be no more effective than the
prohibition of alcohol, because
they are all attack on symptoms
and not on causes of dieseases.

. we are serious in our
attempts to solve problems, we
better start identifying the real
problems and their real causes.
Conditions now exist which need
to be understood and acted upon.
Certainly the time has come to
stop worrying about the
superficial appearance of society
and its individual members, and
start “straightening up the mess
that's inside."

Collins explains
term appointments

by Amy Gurian

"Nobody has been fired,"
President Evan R. Collins stated at
his Conference with students
yesterday. He continued to
explain that Dr. Waterman and
Mrs. Rhoads hold 3-year term
r, ' ‘ ‘, which will expire
in June of 1970.

There are 2 groups of faculty
members; about one-half, or 400
are on term appointments; the
other half are permanent.
According to Collins, the term
appointment system tends to
“keep the university alive and
changing." “When the term
appointment comes to its end,
it terminates." Two hundred or
more positions terminate each
year and no one is guaranteed a
renewal. Appointees are notified
at least one year in advance of
their release.

At the end of the term, the job
usually stays in the department,
which decides on the line. The
department may extend or divide
the position, or merely seek new
candidates.

This past year, as an emergency
méggure, the lines went into other
departmeﬁfs. due to shifts in
enrollment. This yeah "°_i°bs can
be filled until preregistraiffm Mk“
place so that positions may if“
allocated in departments which
need them.

President Collins has asked
Dean Pcrlmutter to establish a
review committee to investigate
the recent actions. In reference to

the need for student's
participation, he pointed to the
fact that the Psychology
Department was the only
department in the College of Arts
and Sciences in which students
have not had representation.

Seniors, annoyed with the
rumor that a fine was imposed on
students who did not participate
in the graduation ceremony, were
assured by Collins that no such
ﬁne exists. "We are not dragging
anyone into attending
commencement."

The Task Force reports will be
available within the next few
days, and will he referred to the
appropriate UniVersity
committees and Central Council.
These reports deal with
administrative organization, the
academic calendar, and an
experimental college.

A modified-semester plan has
been proposed, whereby final
exams would be given before the
December holidays. Two
committees will also present their
recommendations on a pass/fail
system. To explain the Task Force
reports, MYSKANIA is planning
to hold a series of meetings.

When questioned about the
plans to increase lectures next
year, President Collins defended
[be policy by saying that the best
lecture“; in the department would
be available to  Studenm Small
discussion groups could .the" {’9

separate seminars.

receives  

A 3430.000 gun: has been

received by the Mathematics
Department from the National
Science Foundation under the
foundation’s Departmental
Science Development Program.
The award is one of 12 grants in
the program designed to improve
the quality of research and
education in individual areas of
science and engineering at
universities operating at the
graduate level.

The University's mathematics
department, of which Vincent J.

.Cowling is chairman, is the only

mathematics department selected
in the current awards totaling
$7,241,670. Each grant supports a
specific area of science,
engineering, or mathematics in
which the grantee institution
already has sufficient strength to
serve as a base for significant and
further improvement to a higher
level of capability.

Professor Cowling said the the
award “was granted largely
because we were able to attract
initially to Albany an outstanding
group of mathematics professors
many of whom have earned
international reputations because
of their contributions to
mathematics."

The department chairman
pointed out that the idea behind
the grant is that the department
be able to build a distinguished
graduate faculty. Commented
Professor Cowling, “That is the
reason for awarding the grant to
the department, The students will
benefit by virtue of the fact that
they will have access to very
distinguished and able teachers.
This comes at a time when the
competition for graduate students
is keen and it is extremely
important to be able to present to
potential graduate students a
distinguished faculty.
Undergraduates benefit because
such a high calibre staff provides
them in turn with instructors who
will give them a broader
perspective and broader view of
modern mathematics."

The objective of the
development plan for the
mathematics department is to
provide a solid core of research

and doctoral-degree activity in the -
field of analysis. with particqu
emphases on functional analysis
and the related or included ﬁelds
of real and complex analysis. ‘
applied mathematics, probability,
and statistics. ho years ago, 15
active research mathematicians
joined the faculty which by
September of this year will
number 40.

0f the initial group of research
mathematicians, 10' are in the
field of functional analysis or the
related ﬁelds described above. Of
these, three work in abstract
functional analysis, five in real or
complex analysis and two in
probability theory. The,
development plan, supported by
the grant, calls for the addition of
three professors, an assistant
professor, and four postdoctorals
for the first year; two professors,
one associate professor and six
postdoctorals for the second year;
one professor, one associate
professor, and eight post doctorals
for the third year. In addition,
support for 10, 16, and 20
graduate students will be
furnished for the first, second,
and third years, respectively.
