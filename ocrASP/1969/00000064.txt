There are several cases of German Measles on campus. This is
generally a very mild disease with no complications and the individual
is most infectious prior to developing the rash.,

During the ﬁrst three months and possibly the first six months of
pregnancy. however, the disease can constitute a real hazard to the
unborn fetus, occasionally causing congenital abnormalities.

As a matter of health education; individuals who are pregnant
should be advised to avail themselves of an immunology test to See if
they have an immunity to German Measles unless they are absolutely
certain that they had German Measles (rubella, “mild” measles) in

childhood.

Ask at the Student Health Service if there are any questions.

In order to keep your contact lenses as
comfortable and convenient as they were
meant to be, you have to take care of
them. But until now you needed two or
more separate solutions to properly
prepare and maintain your contacts. Not
with Lensine. Lensine is the one lens
solution for complete contact lens Care.

Cleaning your contacts with Lensine
retards the buildup of foreign deposits on
the lenses. And soaking your contacts in
Lensine overnight assures you of proper
lens hygiene. You‘gétr a free soaking case
on the bottom of every bottle of Lensine.

It has been demonstrated that improper
storage between wearings may result in
the growth of bacteria on the lenses.
This is a sure cause of eye irritation and
in some cases can endanger your vision.
Bacteria cannot grow in Lensine which is
sterile. sell-sanitizing. and antiseptic.

Just a drop or two of Lensine, before you
insert your lens, coats and lubricates it
allowing the lens to float more freely in
the eye’s fluids. That's because
Lensine is an "isotonic" solution.
which means that it blends with
the natural fluids of the eye.

Let your contacts be the
convenience they were

meant to be. Get

some Lensine, from the
Murine Company. Inc.

CPS is is the story of the
Sta(te many College at Old
Westbury, N.Y. Westbury is an
experimental school conceived by
a coalition of Kennedy-style
liberals and State University
bureaucrats. Begun with high
hopes, it has turned out to be one
of the most creative atte'mpts by
the System to re-channei
disenchanted students’ energies
"constructively."

Old Westbury students have
been described as "hand-picked
rebels" politically all somewhere
left of Hubert Humphrey. They
cam to Westbury as the Pilgrims
came to the New World—to build
the city on the hill—attracted by

of "fullr A U,"
educational

a “relevant
experience."

Some, mostly white
middle-class students, came as
missionaries of reform; others,
mostly non-white lower-class
students, came as native to be
reformed. A small minority of
both white and non-white
students came as skeptics, to
enjoy the idyllic atmosphere of a
Long Island estate and to
challenge the Westbury approach
to education.

Because of the small, intimate
situation of the campus—83
students on a fist-name basis with
15 teachers and
administrators-the administration
was able effectively to reduce all
political and academic problems
to problems of psychology. Both
faculty and students became
aware of contradictions in the
experiment, but at the same time
became immobilized from acting
out the consequences.

With all the power centralized
the hands of President Harris
Wofford (a well-known educator
and former adviser to Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson) and his
advisers, faculty members and
students became pawns in a
lifesize chess game—its object,
Icgitimizing the college.

Political confrontation began
when the administration began
moving into areas in which the
various campus factions had
primary interest; the first was
selection of new faculty. The
Westbury faculty (under the “full
partnership arrangement”)
expected to select their own
colleagues; the students (under
the some illusion) demanded a
voice in the selection; the

L' SUC. at West‘bury

President said the power or
appointment was his alone.

compromise was finally
reached under which a Committee
of elected faculty and students
would select candidates from the
applications, and the President
would appoint them. Wofford
retained veto power,‘but he could
not appoint anyone who had not
been selected by the committee,
This seemed to work well until
the committee selected a
candidate who did not meet with
Wofford’s approval.

At the same time a faculty
member was not rehired by the
administration for next year
because he acted in an
"unprofe-ional ‘fashion”—nlsu
against the vote of the Faculty
:1 . .. p  Whe a
state budget cut halted further
faculty appointments, the
committee dissolved itself,
somewhat disenchanted with its
effectiveness.

In January, the majority of
students moved off-campus to
begin their second-semester field
projects, and Wofford moved to
redefine and redirect the college.
Westbury was divided into three
constituent colleges: a disciplines
school, a learning-by-teaching
school, and the original urban
studies school. Provosts for the
first two were appointed, again
by-passing the Selection
Committee.

When radical students began
organizing against Wofford, he
offered them a fourth constituent
college of their own. Negotiations
broke down when it became
apparent that the radical coalition
was unwilling to be co-opted.

Old Westbury is an experiment
only in the sense that it providcs
more data to further substantittlr'

FRIDAY APRIL IS, I969

 

  

Hod. Morris 8. Abram,
president of world famous
Brandeis University, will deliver
the annual B. Paul Broida
Memorial Lecture at Congregation
Beth Emeth on Wednesday
evening, April 23, at 8:30. His
subject will be “Conflict on the
Campus."

Mr. Abram won national
prominence in 1963 when he was
awarded the U.S. Supreme Court
decision which established the
"one man-one vote"
reapportionmcnt principle. He
was in the news again most
recently when his handling of the
black militant uprising on the
Brandeis campus recieved
international attention and praise.

Sixty-five black students of the
Brandeis Afro-American
Organization seized the campus
communication center at
Waltham, Massachusetts and
presented President Abram with
ten “non-negotiable" demands.
While the student bid for
autonomy in Negro affairs was
only one of scores of similar
incidents throughout America,
Abram’s approach to the affair
was uniquely successful.

A Boston newspaper editor said
of the csisis at Brandeis:
"President Abram’s wise
leadership in the trying days just
passed has resulted not so much in
a victory for the university or
himself as a triumph for academic
integrity and reason."

Before assuming the presidency
of Brandeis last year, Mr. Abram
held a number of important
government posts. He was senior
adviser to the US. Mission to the
United Nations under Ambassador
Arthur Goldberg. President
Johnson appointed him to
represent the United States on the
United Nations Commission on
Human Rights and to membership
on the National Advisory Council
on Economic Opportunity.
President Kennedy appointed him
ﬁrst counsel to the Peace Corps in
1961. From 1963 to 1968 he was
president of the American Jewish
Committee.

Born and raised in Fitzgerald,
Gerogia, Mr. Abram attended
Oxford University as in Rhodes
Scholar. He earned his law degree
at the University of Chicago Law
School and is a summer cum
luudc. Phi Beta Kappa graduate of
the University of Georgia.

During World War II, he was it
major in Air Corps Intelligence. In

 

  
    
 
 

on

1946 he was a member of the
American prosecution staff at the
war crimes trials in Nuremberg,
Germany.

In ,the 1954 Georgia
Democratic primaries, Mr. Abram
waged a vigorous campaign for the
cngressional nominatioh. He won
a majority of the votes cast but
lost the nomination because of
the Georgia county unit election
system. He challenged that system

the Catapult” 

through the courts and in 1968
won the landmark decision that
affected reapportionment
decisions involving the United-
States Congress and state
legislatures screw the nation.

Mr. Abram was appointed
president of Brandeis University
in 1968 to succeed Dr. Abram L.
Sachar.

The lecture will be open to the
public without charge.

Partial S-U;s stem
advantage is a ‘Iie’

by Dick Collier

(Editors' note: This statement
was written in response to a front
page story on the new S-U
proposal by Academic Standing
Committee appearing in the ASP,
April 15.)

As Chairman of the
Commission for Academic Affairs
of the Student Association, I
demand a retraction of a
statement that appeared in the
article “Another Pass-Fail
Considered" on page 1 of last
Tuesday's ASP. The statement in
question reads: “In addition, the
proposal is a broad step in the
direction of academic freedom
since it gives the student the
opportunity to decide if his entire
course of study will be completely
S-U or entirely A through E or an
individually weighted
combination of these
alternatives."

This was given as an advantage
of the partial system proposed by
the Committee on Academic
Standing of Faculty Senate. I
demand the statement's retraction

for one simple reason: it is an out
and out lie! I am not concerned
with whether the statement just
slipped into the article somewhere
along the line or whether it was
someone’s deliberate
misrepresentation of fact. In the
context of the article, it is a lie.

If everyone had the time to
think out the implications ofthis
particular partial system, the
falsity of this claim would readily
become apparent. chcvcr, too
much happens on this campus for
the reader of the ASP to think out
every implication and
unfortunately, a casual reading of
Tuesday’s article may have
aroused support for this partial
system at the informational
meetings that have just been held
by the Committee on Academic
Standing.

Susquehanna University,
Pennsylvania State, Iona College,
Hunter College, Queens College,
