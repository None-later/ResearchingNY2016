Lacrosse IClanla 3 Sat.

Albany State’s lacrosse club takes on ita'aecon opponent of the
lesson this Saturday afternoon at Two o'clock in the “bowl” behind
,ths gymnasium. Their opponent will be Castleton State College of
.Vermont. V, . ‘
’ . Cutleton, a vanity team for the past four years, plays some of the
toughest teams in the northeast and will be no pushover for State.
Last year, they were an unimpreuive 0-6, but have eight returning
Iettermen on a twenty-six man squad. Their top‘acorer last year was
r Harry Evans who scored ten goals in six games. Their co-‘captains are
_‘defense’man Bob Rotelia and midfielder Bob Maretta. Castleton is
coached by Dick Terry.
V State's squad is in tact after a hard-fought victory last Saturday
against Mohawk lacrosse club. "RB." Sechrist and Dave Riegel came
up with foot trouble during the week, but will'be able to assume their
regular starting defense positions on Saturday. Mark Werder, a
sophomore midfielder, is recovering from pulled leg muscles but will
also be ready'to go.

The Dane Crossmen will be looking to extend their unbeaten streak
to eight over a two year period on Saturday. Last year, the club was
5-0-1, a tie with tough Corning Community College marring a perfect
record. Looking beyond Saturday's encounter, coach Silvey’s charges
will- play at home agath Cobleskill Ag. and Tech. next Wednesday
and then travel to Rochester Instituteof Technology on Saturday.

Tennis Travels North

_ Albany State's varsity tennis team travels north this weekend for
encounters with Plattsburgh State (on Friday) and Potsdam State (on
Saturday). The team, yet to be tested this season, is strong with
nturjners and solid transfers and sophomores from last year's frosh
aqua . A

Playing in the number one position will be last year's top Dane,
,Ron McDermott. Ron posted an 8-2 singles record last year. In the
number two spot will be basketballer Dave Hawley, a transfer from
RPI who sat out last year. Ken Fishman will play in the third position.
Ken was the undefeated number one man on last year's frosh tum.

Filling the number four: "’ will be r" Ted " L ,
Ted, like Fishman, was undefeated last year as a freshman. Ross
Puaatere will be the number five starter for coach Lewis’ team. He is a
transfer from Fordham and lives in nearby Watervliet. Norm Walton, a
junior transfer from Corning Community College will be the number
six singles man.

The pairings in the doubles matches will be McDermott and Hawley
(no. 1), Fishman and Rosenberg (no. 2), and Pusatere and sophomore
Bruce Hettesheimer. ,

Hawley sprained his ankle at practice on Thursday and may not be
able to make the trip. If so, Hettesheimer would become the number
six singles player. How much of a damper Dave's injury may put on
Albany’s victory hopes is not known yet.

George Webb won his second

In seven innings, Webh allowed

Although the Danes could not
put across a run in the last seven
innings, the seven they scored in
the first two proved more than
enough as Siena never seriously
threatened uiitil the eighth inning
when they scored twice.

In their first ﬁve games, the
Danes have displayed u powerful

THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN
BRODIE has been advertised as
“simply great." The truth of the
matter is that it is simply awful. If
one stood outside the theater, he
would probably think the film
hilarious. Once inside, however,
he would realize the audience was
laughing at the movie instead of
with it.

In today's era of million dollar
productions there is no such thing
as a film which has nothing to
offer; although MISS JEAN
BRODIE comes close. True there
is Pamela Frankin's nude body,
but almost all of today's films
have some flesh scenes. Miss
Frankin has some fine features
but the scene is done blundly and
with almost no nrtistic value.
Director Robert Ncume Look n
bad play and made a worse movie.

Maggie Smith is a fine actress
(She played the secretary in “The
VIPs) but she is miscast us the
tragically romantic Miss Brodie.
She plays the occasionully funny
classroom scenes well, but in the
parts that require the
“pussionotc” Miss Brodie to
become overwrought, she
overucts. This can hurdly be
blamed entirely on Miss Smith;
actually Jay Allyn's screenpluy is
ﬁlled with this kind of blutnnt
inconsistency.

The Art Council will sponsor
the opening of llic Art Cu'lncil

Saturday evening at 8:00 pm. on

variety of prints on displuy will be

Robert Rauschenbcrg.

As no added attraction Mr.
Morris Murkowitz will present ruro

Technically the movie is even
worse. The camera work is often
less adept than some first year
ﬁlm students’. Mistakes in depth
of field were obvious. That is to
any, background objects go in and
out of focus almost
indiscriminately. Camersmen
often throw the depth of fieidout
of focus to enhunce un effect. In
this case though no effect is
enhanced, all that is shows the
amateur incompetence which
went into the production of this
ﬁlm. These poor qualities are
further noticed in the color tone
changes which occur with the
chunging of each reel.

All in all, THE PRIME OF
MISS JEAN BRODIE is not worth
the celluloid it is printed on.

To the Editors:

I noted with interest a review
of the film "The Fixer," by
Cheryl Kupras in the Tuesday,
March 11 issue of the ASP.

Interestingly enough, while I
agree with most of her
conclusions (ﬁne acting, good
film, easy empathy by audience,
etc.) I believe she managed to miss
the entire thrust of the film, both
in its major points and in the
innuendos.

Not to say that she is alone. I
also feel Frankenheimer made the
same mistake in his interpretation
of the book, so Miss Kupras is in
good company, if my
interpretation is correct.

Both Frankenheimer and Miss
Kupras seem to view Yakov Bok,
the Jew from the vantagepoint of
Christianity. I found the Christ
symbolism somehwhatoverbenring
in the film, most especially the
"Calvary" scene at the end, To
anyone who has read Malamud’s
book, it is obvious that any
complaints about changing the
meaning of the book can only be
regarded as the grossest of
understatements.

Miss Kupras compounds the
crime. She concerns herself with
the “martyrdom” of Bok. Her
answer to the question of what he
is a martyr to is “surely not to his
religion."

Therein lies what I believe to be
the actual central point of the
story. Yakov Bok is a Jew. Many
Jews throughout history have
tried to deny or at least play
down their Jewishness. “I am not
a political man," Yakov Bolt says
not only for himself, but for
thousands, even millions of other
Russian Jews of his time, and even
German and Polish Jews of
another time. “Who cares what
you say. You are a Jew," is the
answer given to him by Tsar
Nicholas II and Hitler. "You
cannot deny your heritage.”

Yakov Bok, the symbol, has
been accused of ritual murder ofu
little boy. His uccusers say he
drained the blood from the boy to
take to the synagogue for the
making of Passover matzo. For this
"crime" he is persecuted through

’l‘hnl. Albany State has spared
no pains to obtuin the best
nvnilnblc talent for its music
department became quite evident
Mondny night when flutist irvin
Gilmun, assisted by piunist
Findlay Cockrell und cellist John

Gobcrmun, gave an unusual,
varied, and highly pleasing
concert. He played with grcut

fluency nnd ease, and with in clear,
full, nnd rich tone. Throughout,
both nccompunists shined in their
work, cspccinlly Gohcrmun in the
Villn-Lobos “Jet Whistle."

The program opened with
l'lnrol Lnudenslngcr's “Evocution”
for solo I'lutu, n lyric work which
owod more to its lyricism for its
nppcnl than it (lid to its
modernism. The very good
performance this work received
wus ulmost more than it deserved,
I thought. Next on tho progrnm
was the only stundurd piece for
the whole evening-~thc Bach
Sonutn in g minor for Flute,
harpsichord, und collo. This piece
offered not only Eindluy
Cockrull's urcu debut on
harpsichord, but also some
extremely fine playing in the
difficult last movament.

The Villn-Lobos “Assobio n
Jain" (The Jet Whistle), for flutn
and cello, the next offering on the

program was the high point of the
evening. This fairly modern work
wns not only pleasing in its
melodies, nnd interesting in its
effects, but seemed to have
considerable depth as well, more
than people usually ascribe to
Villn-Lobos.

The second half of the concert
featured three unknown pieces;
“’I‘wo Songs" for ﬂute and piano
is modern 12-tone piece by the
Irish-Indian composer, Patrick
Juswunt Gandhi, u trio sonutu for
flute, uccllo and piano by Gabriele
l’iernc written in 1927 for tho
Elisabeth Sprnguc Coolidge
Foundnlion, and the 1851
Funtulsic for flute and piano by
that forgotten Romuntic,
Geogcslluc. The Gnndhl I though
interesting but not very sound
compositionully, but the two
French pieces were delightful.
And nlthough at times they were
are meaningful us popcorn, their
cheery tunefulncss, especially in
tho Plume, more than made up for
this fact. For an encore, the
“Dance of the Blessed Spirits"
from Gluck's Orpheus was pluyod,
This type of program is the type i
would like to see more of, because

Yakov Bok says again and again.
Yet, at the climactic point in the
book he proclaims “One thing I’ve

Yakov Bok did, that whatever
they may consider themselves, the
rest of the world still considers
them Jews.

They all eventually learn that in

accused of ritual murder by
millions of Russinas; that in the
fourth decade of the twentieth
century they can be held
