All right, who did it? Whooo
did it? Some 'freak or straight
picked up thirty shekels two
weeks ago, or maybe they got
bought off some other way. I_
don’t know, it may have been me.

Isn’t there a quote someplace,
“As you have done to the least of
them, so have you done unto

me?" Who have you crucified"

lately? (You don't have to use
nails and a hammer you know.)

Stoning people with pieces of
rock has been out of fashion in
this country for a little while, but
we have invented a goodly
number of substitutes.

How many bigots have you
counted in the last month? If you
bothered to count them, then
you‘re one too.

What are you; a professor, a
student, or maybe even a
secretary or an administrator. Are
you black or white? A Jew or a
Christian (tsk-tsk) or even a
Muslim? What are you, a man or a
beast?

Humans should be able to' be

people first. Doing a good job

there takes away the need to
establish 'your own little
dominance hierarchy (that’s
psychological talk). That's also
what most animals do.

Desiderata

Just how does one go about
being a good human being?
“Desiderata”; found in Saint
Paul’s Church, dated 1692.

“Go placidly amid the noise,
and haste and remember what
peace there may be in silence. As
far as possible without surrender
be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and
clearly; and listen to others, even
the dull and ignorant; they too
have their story."

“Avoid loud and aggressive

‘peraons, they are vexations to the

spirit If you compare yourself
with o ers, you may become vain
and bitter? for always there will
be greater‘ and lesser persons than
yourself. Enjoy your
achievements as well as your
plans."

“Keep interested in your own
career, however humble; it is a
real possession in the changing
fortunes of time. Exercise caution
in your business affairs; for the
world is full of trickery. But let
this not blind you to what virtue
there is; many persons strive for
high ideals; and everywhere life is
full of heroism."

“Be yourself. Especially, do not
feign affection. Neither be cynical
about love; for in the face of all
aridity and disenchantment it is
perennial as the grass."

"Take kindly the counsel of the
years, gracefully surrendering the
things of youth. Nurture strength
of spirit to shield you in sudden
misfortune. But do not distress
yourself with imaginings. Many
fears are born of fatigue and
lonliness. Beyond a wholesome
discipline, be gentle with
yourself."

“You are a child of the
UniVerse, no less than the trees
and the stars; you have a right to
be here. And whether or not it is
clear to you, no doubt the
Universe is unfolding as it
should."

“Therefore be a peace with
God, whatever you conceive Him
to be, and whatever your labors
and aspirations, in the noisey
confusion of life keep peace with
your soul."

"With all it's sham, drudgery
and broken dreams, it is still a
beautiful world. Be careful. Strive
to be happy.“ ‘

The Romantic mind has certainly a rough time of
it in this computerized, scientific, polluted world.
Both external and internal "feeling" has
disappeared, for outwardly one must be hygenic,
and inwardly, the mind swirls among rapids of sWIft,
cold waters.

Such a bleak life is the price paid for America
1969, the microcosmic world of SUNYA being a
case in point. Ivy towers have been replaced by the
steel beam and the skeleton of structural concrete.
The. vision is one of windows without mosaic,
fountains without lilies, classrooms without color.
Teacher and student, colorless also and irrelevant
besides, remain nameless, aimless, mindless. That is
SUNYA, and that too is America.

What a pity, this loss of the Romantic! The arts,
particularly theatre and movie, as if in a last, quite
unsuccessful attempt to regain the loss of feeling,
have settled instead for emotional shock and
assorted vulgarities of sex, perversion, and violence.
Popular music, an admixture of noise on
non-thought, has similarly missed the swooning
heights of what was once a romantic possibility.

Solitude, once sought for a time “when the whole
body is one sense (Thoreau), is gone. Today,
solitude is either forCed or impossible; forced by the
push of computerized pressure, impossible to escape
from the pull of mass culture. Confinement has

a full moon during summer: Alas, an, impossibility
this summer, for some guy will be walking around
up there, watching you while you watch it. ‘

Thanks to science, everywhere is people._

But it is not just the confinement of space; it is
also the contraction of time.
Today-tomorrow-yesterday are but one in the same,
separate no longer by dark and light and day by
day, but by the arbitrary divisions of an
unconcerned clock, splitting days into hours and
hours into minutes and minutes into seconds.
Escaping reality translates to escaping time, and in
America 1969, this is a crime, punishable by death
or banishment. No one is late for dinner, for
punctuality is next to godliness.

So too is cleanliness. This is hygenic America:
sterilized, plasticized, containerized, cellophaned,
packaged. Hands and teeth, not to mention the
armpits, are to be pure at all times, while minds are
allowed to wallow in the gutters of American cities
and the morass of mass society.

Governments are big, brutal, stupid; people small,
brutal, stupid. Budgets are for destruction.
Production is for pollution. Affluence is for
television sets and 409 supercharged, superduper,
rubber wheeled iron coffins.

Words have become empty, bodies fulfill

become loneliness; solitude, absurd. Solitude is no
longer a pleasure to delight in; it is a soldier in

Viel lam.

Science too has worked it’s wonders. Imgaine

Over the years numerous
Congressmen, led by Senator
Ribicoff have introduced

legislation to provide tax relief for
higher educational expenses.

This year legislation has been
reintroduced in the House Ways
and Means Committee by Rep.
Garner E. Shriver of Kansas. His
bill would provide for any
taxpayer ll creditagainst his annual
Federal tax liability of up to $325

on the first $1500 paid by him for
higher education expenses for
himself or any other individual.
These expenses include tuition,
fees, books, supplies, and
equipment required in any
institution of higher education.

In a speech to the House on
February 5, Rep. Shriver said:
“educated citizens are truly our
greatest natural resource...we
cannot afford to turn our backs
on the source of our strength.”

Every student and parent
knows that the expense of
providing a college education has
been rising in recent years, and
that it will rise even more in the
future. Our major problem Rep.
Shriver says “is to find the best
solution to ease the financial
burden of the parents of college
students, llnd, in turn, also benefit
our institutions of higher
education.”

Rep. Sllrivcr argues that it is
the responsibility of the members
of Congress to devise a solution to
this cost problem which will
benefit both moderate and
low-income families and students.

“We must preserve the healthy
diversity in our lligllcr education
system by assisting all of our
institutions, bc thty large or

small, public or private. And most
important, we must accomplish
these goals with the least amount
of governmental interference in
our educational community."

While not a cure—all, the income
tax credit bill will, if passed
provide relief for strained family
budgets, and allow for the
continued' independence and
diversity of our institutions of
higher education.

Studies indicate that under this
bill 62 percent of the dollar
benefit of the tax credit would go
to families with incomes between
$3,000 and $10,000 per year.
These families comprise 82
percent of our population.
Ninety~one percent of the benefits
would go to families with incomes
below $20,000.

Rep. Shriver calls the tax credit
for higher education expenses “a
workable solution to ll
growing national problem," and
urged his colleagues to "assure
that the future of our fine
educational system will be
maintained and that the
thousands of qualified present and
future students will be able to
enjoy the benefits of the highest
quality higher education
possible."

Draft resistance

WASHINGTON (CPS)-—Draft
resistance is rapidly becoming one
of the lnost frequent Federal
crimes, ranking behind only auto
theft and immigration infractions.

Federal Judges, in response, are
muting out penalties of
unprcccdenlcd severity, but

without mucll visible effect on
draft disobedience.

At least 2,200 draft cases are
now pending in the courts.

In 1968, prison sentences for
draft violations averaged 37.3
months, compared with 32
months ill 1967.

to go up again this coming academic year! A new
policy on the Student Activity Assessment (Student
Tax) was presented for review. This bill called for
allowing all students to vote in election, alld not just
those who have paid the Student Activity
Assessment. Two changes for Election Procedures
were approved. Central Council also established ll
Committee to discuss and recommend to Central
Council the Price Differentials for ALL activities for
the 1969=70 academic year. Additionally, tllc
budget of MYSKANIA was llppl’OVed.

I think that it is very much unfair to the Student
Body that the ASP, the only campus newspaper,
should be careless enough not to send a reporter to
the meetings. A point of information: Central
Council meetings are open to anyone and are held
each Thursday evening at 7:30 pm in Campus

Pot or Humanity ?

To the Editors:
In reference to WALTER and "Rites of Spring."
I once felt moved to say something regarding a
bail fund for those accused of drug offences and
money spent to secure the privilege of drug use.

However, I do need to say something.

The hunger pangs in the stomach of a Biafran
child magnified as they are echoed by 2/3 of his
contemporaries have a far more effective message
than any words I can tilink of.

The plowed flesh of a Vietnamese child and the
bone infections of his companions express my
concern for more eloquently than anything I could
write.

The nlonns of an old woman who must disturb
half a hospital wing because her family can not
llfford to have her die alone conveys my message.

The one tenth of our population suffering from
mental illness, crippled children, retarded children
and cancer victims all speak for me.

The establishments of this world have ignored
these needs to spend 150 to 200 billion dollars on
the game of power politics. Can we afford to ignore
these needs and let our money go to pot?

Let us have a truly revolutionary increase in the
range of our experience. Let us open ourselves to
the unﬁlled needs of our brothers. If we choose to
ignore these needs we no longer be revolutionaries
or visionaries but will instead become mere
cscapists.

Love is cheaper than pot or a sugar cube of LSD.
Love also opens our minds to new horizons. And
Love requires more guts and more commitments
than either.

now available on this campus: my
Commission’s opinion poll, in
which total S-U was
overwhelmingly supported in
contrast to anything else but total
s-U (the present system, partial
pass-fall, or other modiﬁcation)
and the survey taken last year by
University College which
indicated an even greater majority
favored at least one pass-fail
course per semester, but on their
own choice!

The Commission fully agrees
and has already expressed the
need for further gathering of
student and faculty opinion. Be
we added the suggestion that
more information be
disseminated. Perhaps we should
have specified--we meant true
information!

Let’s face the facts. The
proposed partial pass-fail system
gives the choice ‘to the faculty.
Only if an instructor happens not
to choose will the choice be up to
the student, and even then the
faculty member may refuse to use
the written evaluation method.

First of all, the Commission
feels the best goals of pass-fail can
only be fully realized if the course
is taught on an S-U basis. If a
student is luckyenouglto find one
section of the course he wants not
offered A-E but left to student
choice and if that section happens
to ﬁt into his schedule, he may
still only receive an S-U, nothing
more, since a handful of students
might desire A-E grading and the .
instructor, out of fairness to
them, might teach on an A-E basis
after all. Or he might teach 8-D
and give that handful an even
rougher A-E estimate than now
exists.

Then let us assume my
Commission is totally wrong in its
beliefs that all courses taken by a
student in any one semester
should be all S-U or all A-E.Still,

partial system should be instituted
that gives that choice to the
students. The supposed
justifications given by the
Committee on Academic Standing

I em.   «

demands for three differently
graded sections of each course,
near demands for
evaluations, or the menthl
gymnastics of tryiugrousseenrai
different gradingmethods in a

single course. but let the fsculty‘ .
and departments further reply to j

those who would place on'thelr
shoulders the nightmare of using
practically tllk proposal to the
satisfaction of all concerned.

Therefore, I seek to have the
paragraph in. question retracted
not because Academic Affairs
Commission has judged, on the
basis of 'evidence and sensible
projections and considerations of
all pass-fail systems, that the
ability to choose both 8-D and
A-E courses within a semester is
not in the best interest of the
student, of the faculty and
departments, or of the reputation
and quality of SUNYA. This is
our opinion, but we are not foes
of rational dialogue and
disagreement honestly defended
by those who feel another system
might solve current problems
better.

Whether current problems are
solved or not, I demand the
retraction for a much more
important reason, one deeply
involving all of us on campus. This
university has an excellent,
long-standing record as one place
where rational, reasonably-
expressed student opinion has
not met with huge credibility gaps
nor with faculty or adminstration
put-one. I am disappointed and
angered to see “faculty choice"
(which the faculty may well not
choose on reflection) extended to
students under the guise of
“student choice" and “diversity.”

Let us have no pretensions that
;his proposed system will give a
SUNYA undergraduate a real
chance to take all courses S-U or
all courses A-E; let us not pretend
he can take the courses he wants
S-U and receive letter grades in all
courses in which he wishes that
distinction.
