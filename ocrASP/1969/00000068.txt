Ed. Note:‘ The following is a
statement issued by ken
Ghaffari, President of V the
International Student Anochtion,
clarifying their position
concerning‘ a n on
Febnwy 27, l969, and an
iivitstion extended to Mr. Alfred
lilentlnl ' -’

Due~ to a misunderstanding of
our position, concerning the panel
discussion sponsored .by us called:
“Is there a difference between a
Jew and a Zionist?" on Thursday
February 27, 1969 and the
invitation extended to Mr. Alfred
Lilienthal to speak on the same
subject in late April this year, we
see it imperative to state the
position of this organization on
these and other matters of interest
to our members in particular, and
the University Community in
general:

1. The international Student
As'sociation encourages the
formation of any national,
re ligious, cultural and

You’ll never get anywhere without it.

Nothing helps a young engineer‘s
career like being given a challenge.
Which is another way of saying a chance
to fail now and then. To make his own

At Western Electric we give our newly
recruited engineers responsibility almost
immediately. They make their own de-
cisions. Learn from their own errors.

Don’t get as wrong. We keep our

demands reasonable enough so that our
recruits can make their decisions at their
own pace. But our thinking is, a man
feels awfully good about even a small

decision when it’s his.

geographical units on this campus,
and feels ,thatas long as the
formation of these units would
not encourage violation of
individual rights and destruction
of property whether it be public
or private, these units can enrich
our educational experience
quantitatively and qualitatively.

2. The International Student
Association feels that it has a
moral responsibility todefend the
National Creeds and Cultural
heritage of any member of groups
of members who may be
unjustifiably attacked or
discriminated upon by any
individual or group of individuals.

3. Public statements by
individual members in defense or
rejection of any particular issue
whether it concerns political or
cultural affairs would not
necessarily reflect the opinion of
the general membership of the
I.S.A. The international Student
Association Constitution, Article
VII, Section 1 states that: "The
President is the authorized
spokesman of the organization
and no other member may make
public statements. "it is obvious
that any member including the
president is entitled to his
personal and subjective evaluation
of any matter of his choice. No
member can be questioned for
having reached any conclusion so
long as such is not presented as
the general policy of the i.S.A.

4. in our statement of Policy
concerning the above-mentioned
Panel discussion and the invitation
extended to Mr. Alfred Lilienthal
to speak on the same subject, we
state our views as follows

“This panel and the following

presentation by Mr. Alfred
Lilienthal received the
unanimous approval of the

executive council of the I.S.A. on
the afternoon of Friday February
twenty first, 1969. It was hoped
that the l.S.A. might bring
together representatives of various
campus organizations which in
recent weeks had become
embroiled in a series of disputes
sparked by the situation in the
Middle East and marked by
derogatory remarks cast at the
political and social creeds of their
respective embers. I.S.A. hoped
that by bringing them all together
in a panel discussion sponsored by
a neutral group. they could all
express their points of View in a
rational and peaceful manner in a

spirit of brotherhood and
intellectual honesty".
5. Now that the panel

discussion is over, judging from
the remarks made by various
people, we can say that we
conducted ourselves in the most
rational and unbiased manner. We
cannot be accused of favoring any
specific cause except for trying to
enlighten our members and
others. on one of the most
pressing issues in our campus and
indeed an issue which confronts
our world at large. In this regard
we need not to draw attention to
the fact that as an organization we
take the liberty of focussing on
any issue which we feel is worth
focussing on.

6. Finally we would like to
affirm that we are ready at any
time to challenge any individual
or group who would "take it for
lranted" that in making
arrangements for these programs
we have been biassed for or
against any one group. The proof
of our neutrality is the taped
program at its entirety and is
available for reexamination of its
contents.

Special Events v' Board is now
accepting I applications  for , its
Spring Event Co-Cha’lrn‘ianshipe.
The positions available are:
Parents Weekend, State Fair, Jazz
Festival, Mixers, Cultural Events,
and four at large positions.

A brief word on the speciﬁcs of
each event might clarify some of
the responsibilities for the
chairman of that event and assist
applicants in organizing their
ideas.

PARENTS WEEKEN D is
designed to encourage parents and
students to meet on campus at a
time when banquets, meetings and
entertainment is geared to both
tastes. This challenging event
usually operates in conjunction
with other functions so that
coordinating skills and planning
are essential. Ideas on drawing
parents to the university, instead
of mystifying them are needed.

STATE FAIR is a full scale
Carnival day which has grown to
provide funds for eligible foreign
students coming to the University.
This worthwhile event calls for
creativity and organizational
ability in pulling the many
separate components into a
unified whole. Each year new
fund raising and quality improving
elements are added.

JAZZ FESTIVAL is one of our
newest events, yet has already
achieved sound status as an
important and well received
program. A cross section of jazz
talent is programmed so that
purists as well as the uninitiated
are treated to the finest in the
field. Though this event is only
three years old, it is a nationally
known Festival, receiving coverage
in “Downbeat” and Jazz
Magazine.

MIXERS and CULTURAL
EVENTS are two board‘activities
which, unfortunately, are'often
slighted. There is tremendous
room here for relatively
unexperienced, but imaginative,
people to vitalize and upgrade
these eVenls. Cultural Events has
provision for theater trips to New
York, film series, and perhaps
presentation of selected, seldom
seen on campus, art forms.

Channel 17
Phone—A-Bid

WMHT (Channel 17), the
educational television station
serving this area, is planning alive
TV auction. They need many
volunteers. Some will be on
camera during the
“Phone'A—Bid” auction. Others
will work behind the scenes.

The “Phone-A-Bid" auction
will be presented from 6 pm to
midnight on four consecutive
nights, May 26-29. The purpose
will be to raise funds fbr the
station, which depends on public
support.

More than 1,000 items-«from
cars to carpets and from loiﬂht‘ats
to lawnmowers--will be auctib‘ﬁdd.
The list will include works ’of art
such' as four graphics "from
Governor Rockefeller's personal
collection.

Viewers in a wide section of
Northeastern New York will be
able to place their bids by phone
from home or from phones at the
auction sitc--the mall at Colonic
Center, near Albany. Volunteer
operators will man 20 telephones
that will be used to receive the
bids.

Channel 17 broadcasts daytime
in-school programs to some
100,000 students in 40 school
districts. At night it offers a wide
variety of programs to “delight,
challenge and inform our
viewers," says General Manager
Donald E. Schein.

 

'AT LARGE poaltlons have
been defined in a'i‘nore structured
fashion, since the earllei positiom
were too nebulous to be
workable. At large members
should be experienced, or highly
skilled individuals in areas related
to programming. They 'devote
their energies 'to the board
specifically, forming a core that
serves to direct this activities of
the event ' chairmen more
efﬁciently. In this capacity they
also serve as trouble shooters or
reference personnel to the .Board
in general. The four positions
available in the at-large capacity
are the three executive seats,
chairman, treasurer, and secretary,
and one other member who would
specialize in Board public
relations and would develop
unified recruitment programs.
Administrative, business and filing
skills are required, as well as the
ability to function well in a group.

Few students are aware of the power and responsibilities of the
Faculty Senate, a body designated in the Faculty By-Laws to be "the
principal policy-forming body of the University."

The Senate is composed of the following ex-officio members: the
Chancellor of the State University of New York, the executive officer
having jurisdiction over the Universitv Centers. the President and Vice

Presidents of the State University
of New York at Albany, the
University Librarian, and the
representatives from the

to the Faculty Senate of the State
University.

Twelve additional Senators are
elected at large from the Voting
Faculty. At least half of these
must be from the assistant
professor and associate professor
ranks.

Thirty-six Senators are elected by the Schools and Colleges from
the Voting Faculty. The President appoints nine additional Senators
to annual appointments, which are renewable.

Elected Senators serve three-year terms, and are elected on a
rotating basis similar to that of the United States Senate. No elected
Senator may serve more than two consecutive terms.

Officers of the Senate are elected to one-year terms. They are: the
Chairman (the President of the University), the Vice Chairman, the
Vice Chairman elect, and the Secretary.

In addition, the Faculty By-Lawa provide for an Executive
Committee of the senate, which is composed of its four officers and
four additional Senators elected annually by the Senate. it is the
responsibility of the Committee to appoint members of the Senate

councils, subject to confirmation

by the Senate. Council members

serve on one-year, renewable appointments.
The Undergraduate Academic Council deals with such areas as

curriculum, admissions,

academic

standing, and honors and

independent study. It is responsible for recommending changes in

power is at

degree requirements for undergraduates; for reviewing new
undergraduate courses; for establishing general undergraduate
academic regulations, as well as standards for the Dean's List and for
academic probation and dismissal; and for establishing admissions
policies, including consultation on the size and general composition fo
the undergraduate student body. The Graduate Academic Council

performs similar duties as they relate to graduate students.

The Student Affairs Council is responsible for considering "all
matters of student life outside the formal curriculum for all students."
These include alumni affairs, counseling, health services, athletics,
financial aids, international students affairs, placement, residence,
student behavior and conduct, and student government and activities.

The remaining councils are: The Council on Research; The
Personnel Policies Council; the Council on Promotions and Continuing"
Appointments; the Council on Educational Policy; and the Library
Council.

Dr. J. Ralph Tibbetts, Vice Chairman of the Faculty Senate,
believes that “the Senate is particularly helpful to students in
expressing the sentiments of the University community where
students are affected." An example of this was the Senate resolution
on the Flynn Bill. The Senate acted in a similar capacity last semester
by supporting President Collins in his dealing with the Black Students’
Alliance demands.

The Senate’s formal responsibilites are largely in areas of academic
program and faculty welfare, but its concerns extend over the whole
range of the University's policies and procedures. The Senate is often
consulted on changes to be made in University policies, and may or
may not choose to take a stand.
