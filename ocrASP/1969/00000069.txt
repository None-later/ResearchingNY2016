LacroSSemen Bury Castleton

Host Cobleskill Tomorrow

by Tore_Nixon I

The Albatiy State [Actuate
Club no its record to two wins
without a lo. as they defeated
Castleton State 14-3, this past
Saturday. ' .. >

Steve Jakway led the attack for
Albany as he scored four of the
fourteen goals. ‘Mark Werder, a
midfielder, added three goals to
the total. '.

Iarry Smith, who scored nine
points last week, again
contributed nine points on two
goals and seven assists. In two
games, Smith is within one all»
of tying last year’s season record
of twelve.

Kev Sheehan, starting at
midfield, continually beat the
Castleton defense down the ﬁeld
to set up the plays. He scored one
goal for State.

Bob Cole played another fine
game in the nets and was credited
with fifteen saves. Tom
Giaquinto, who gave Cole an
occasional rest, was also credited
with seven saves.

Saturday's game was played
under extremely poor conditions
as rain was pouring down
throughout the entire game.
Although the ﬁeld never became
too muddy, the continual
dowpour did hamper the
performance of the players.

Albany came out strong in the
ﬁrst period as they scored six
goals to one for Castleton. The
Danes continued their potent
attack and scored four more times
in the second quarter to take a ten
to two lead into the locker room
at half time.

 

With many of their subs playing
throughout ’ the second half,
.Albany's offense was cut down
somewhat, yet they still managed
four goals.

coach for football. '

The.talk has, begun. Students are beginning to wonder what ever
happeq'ed to the football club that everyone and‘his grandmother
approved of earlier in,the year. A quite valid questlon, so here's the

Everyone! and his grandmother did approve of starting a football

What someone failed to convey to

the st'udent populatipli was the' fact that the State budget (given the
cutback to the education budget) will not provide for the needed

SUNY at Albany asked for one hundred new teaching positions and
was told that, at the most, forty new jobs would be provided for in

the budget. Consequently, and rightly so, the additions to the physical
education staff were the first to be cut.

Where does this leave the club? Without a coach, the University can
and will take no direct steps toward establishing a football team or
club. However, the use of student monies (of which, it is well known,
there is plenty) has not been ruled out. Personnel connected with the
club must. be members of the regular staff of the University. This is
for reasons of supervision and liability in case of injury etc. Long ago,
the administration OK’d the possibility of using student funds to pay

such a coach.

With that technicality out of the way, the only major obstacle lies
with the problem, a constant one at State, of student support. First, it
must be clearly shown to both Athletic Advisory Board and Central

.1 Council that a football club is feasible. These groups, responsible for
student monies do not spend those monies indiscriminately.

There seem to be two major questions to be asked. One, are there
enough interested and talented men at Albany State to field a full
squad? The only way this can be shown to both student groups is for
those who want to play to get together and petition for the monies
needed. Two, does the student body want its money spent on a
football team? This is a prime concern since the last opinion poll was

taken over two years ago.

Going upon the assumption that there are enough men at Albany

State who are interested in playing the sport, that group, whenever it
decides to get its rear in gear, can contact the ASP sports editor for
the exact process required for having football at State next fall.

has been the doubleheader loss to
Oswego.

The top three pitchers are all in
their last year of eligibility.
Righty George Webb is 2-0, with
wins over R.P.i. and Siena, and a
save against Potsdam. He has
struck out 31 batters in 20
innings. Dave Wheeler, also a
righty, is 2-1, with wins over
Stony Brook and Potsdam and a
loss to Oswego. Southpnw Rich

WinTbird Match;
,Stay Undefeated

The Albany State Varsity Golf
team remained undefeated this
past Friday by whipping Oneonts
State 5-2. In running their season
record to 3-0, the team was led by
sophomore Tom Patterson who
shot a fine 76 on the rugged
McGregor Country Club course.
Captain Dave Breiter also
performed admirably as did
Junior Mary Gerzberg and Senior
Gary Turton. State also won the
overall competition with a team
total of 489 to Oneonta's 504.
The team's next match is today at
New Paltz.

The Freshman Team opens its
season on Wednesday with s
quadrangular match against
Fulton-Montgomery C.C.,
Herkimer 0.0., and New Paltz
State. Those comprising the team
are John Heher, Dick Chwartz,
Dave Fink, Bob Fierman, Don
Suhocki and Kevin Seymour.

According to Coach Bill
Schiefflin, the team should be
stronger than last year's squad.
Following their match on
Wednesday, the freshmen will
have their next encounter on
Friday against Cobleskill
Academy.

State University at Albany
varsity baseball coach Bob
Burlingame has a by-line story in
the February 21 issue of
Collegiate Baseball. The veteran
diamond mentor relates how a
team he coached one summer lost
a game by forfeit when an umpire
ejected one of his players and
there was nobody left on the
bench.

 

 

   
  
   

    

Neat year’saeditlon of the Dane
swimming team will hold the
coveted title of "varsity" sport.
The decision was arrived at. last
. week by the Athletic Advisory

Board.

The club, winless in eight meets
this past season, has had its
troubles attracting enough
university men to field a fair sized
squad which would enable it to
compete with more established
opponents.

The record is deceiving. Having
to compete against all varsity
teams with only a handful of
swimmers is not conducive to

' winning. The squad did admirably

Wisconsin and studied v for bk
masters and doctorate at ludlana
University where the famed'Dr.
Jamss “Doc” Counsilman is head
swimming coach. The Albany
mento was a teaching assistant
under Counsllman (who is given
credit for having developed many
of America’s finest swimmers) and
it is he who Kelly acknowledges

for “teaching me all I know about-

competltlve swimming.”

Mr. Kelly has also taught
age-group swimming in Califronia,
Wisconsin, and Indiana. In
September, 1964, he went to
Africa under the auspices of
Sports International and the 11.5.
State Department, serving as
National Advisory Swimming
Coach to the Zambia Amateur
Swimming Union for seven
months, and the United Arab
Republic in Cairo, Egypt, for four
months. He was the first editor of
“Swimming Technl ue,” the
journal of swimming, iving, and
water polo.

Since coming to State in 1967,
he has been busy making
swimming and the swimming
program at the school potentially
successful. Towards these ends, he
has been in contact with both
coaches and high school juniors
and seniors from all over New
York State, looking for possible
material for his team. A number
of boys he has been in
correspondence with have already
been accepted into next year's
freshman class at the University.

The pool, if nothing else,
should attract many a promising
high schoolcr. It is reputed to be
one of the fastest in the nation,
besides being beautiful.
