Narcotic Commission offers

ALBANY. N.Y.--THREE, a
film about three narcotic
addicts...and their road back...will
make its Albany premiere on
April 28 at the Madison Theatre,
1032 Madison Avenue, for a
special one-time showing.

THREE is essentially a
poignant story of real people
responding to real pressures. It
shows addicts as individuals who
hide their fears behind
drugs...capable, clever human
beings who take drugs to avoid
coping with painful realities.

Gradually, painfully, protective
layers of self-deception are
stripped away as the three are
forced to communicate with
others. With the help of older
members of their therapy group,
they gain insight and the
realization that their problems

and fears are not unique.

“When I started working on
THREE for the Commission,"
said John Sughrue, the film’s
producer, “we considered several
approaches to highlight the
horrors of drug addiction. We
finally decided to eliminate all
sensationalism and make a simple,
honest motion picture about real
people and real situations. I'm
glad we did because the characters
are wondrously alive human
beings the audience can feel for
and identify with."

The film makes a powerful plea
for the community’s acceptance
of the rehabilitated addict as a
contributing member of society.

public premiere in New York City

I . and states the entirethesis of the

film.

It is truly horrifying but
necessarily so. As with other films
of today you must not be
affronted by the. use of nudity or
,iolence on the screen; rather, you
must ask why it is there.
Sometimes there is no better
reason than pure sensationalism,
but this is not the case in
Godard'a “Weekend.” His use of
the various kinds of perversiona is
needed to make his point as
forceful as he does. Therefore, it
is necessary to be careful in
viewing this film, for you have to
watch out that you don’t get so
repulsed that you miss what
Godard is saying.

Jean Luc Godard, to my mind,
is commenting on the so-called
cultural revolution. There
pervades, throughout the film,
this comment that no matter
where you think you are going
you’re not really making any
headway but rather only going
back to the beginning.

There is no progress. In order
to bring the cultural revolution
about you must absolutely
obliterate the present "system" of
things. But, according to Godard,
all you’re really doing is moving in

7. “To overcome the honor of: the

citclec. :You 'advance‘ nowhere
except back to the beginning. ‘
'He achieves this through
various techniques, some notably
Godard and some that are just
spectacular in there essence and in
their effect. There are the
"interview" type scenes where
certain characters are more or less
singled out and seem to be talking
to an interviewer. The comments,
however, are directed solely to the
audience and it is in their
perception of the things said that
the effect occurs. Such lines as
“Freedom means violence just as
crime does," “...government is
based on gold, pride and blood,"
“Christ said all men are
brothers-even it it’s true we’re
not in the Middle Ages,” and “I
stayed God because I have no
ambition” have effect in
themselves, but when placed in
the setting, and uttered by the
various characters, they take on
an even more powerful meaning.
Besides the actual lines of the
ﬁlm there are the many visual
images that Godard uses to make
his point hit home. The constant
barrage of bloodepilling out
throughout the film, besides the
many automobile accidents with
half-bodies strewn all over the
screen, and finally the epitome of
grotesqueness: humans eating
other humans; all combine in a
violent way to further the point.
Man is not going anywhere-~he’s

been there before.

This journey back to the
primitive is centered around the
two characters of Roland and
Corine. They are husband and
wife, in an odd sort of way, and
are journeying to Corine's
mothers to settle an estate. In
their, travels they come across
many assorted and sundry people
and thus th-B film evolves.

These characters themselves,
however, are not strictly passive
people. They partake and
sometimes even initiate the
barbaric actions that occur. In the
end it is Corine who runs away
with the revolutionary leader and
ﬁnally eats the flesh of her
husband.

The scenes are gruesome and
sickening, but they are necessary
and explained by one of the
characters in the film. The setting
is a lovely road surrounded by
trees and flowers etc. and Roland
and Corine are wandering around
trying to find. their way. They
encounter two characters, one
whose identity is never quite
clear, and the other being Emily
Bronte. All the characters talk for
awhile and during the
conversation that follows Emily
picks up a stone and begins to
describe it.

In the course of her monologue
she says something about the
stone which also refers to the
audience or society' at large.
Godard has found it necessary to

use such absolutely shocking
techniques because the audience
as the stone, “...has no

independence an no sensitivity.
Therefore it rice a‘something as
powerful as a blow—torch or a
volcano to make an impression."

This is the truth of the stone
and of the film. I would advise
anyone who wants to go see a film
and be more than merely
entertained, go see Godard's
"Weekend,"

“1‘69de Pres-Coiling

“The Psychology Department is
the last of the departments in the
College of Arts and Sciences to
develop any meaningful
participation within the
department.”

President Collins at his
conference yesterday reiterated
his past pressures on all
departments for the development
of “continuous, informal and
effective student participation.”

Students attending the
conference were informed that
“most departments have
developed some procedure for
student involvment."

On another note Collins
revealed that reports of the task
forces on undergraduate reform
are now in appropriate Faculty
Senate council being reviewed for
implementation.

Some aspects of the reports,
President Collins said, may be
implemented by the fall semester.
“Open hearings and discussions"
will be held first.

The final say on the
implementation of a pass-fail
system is in the hands of
Faculty-Senate. it is now
supposedly being reviewed by
Undergraduate Academic Council

A student asked if the final
determination of such plicies
affecting students should be left
to faculty members.

Collins asserted that the
students do have a voice in the
decision but he doesn't “think
students ought to determine this.”
He reemphasized his
encouragement of greater student
participation.

Citizenship

The pass-fail systam, Collins
suggested, will initially be tried on
a restricted, trial basis whereby, a
student can take one course per
semester or only non-major
courses on a pass-fail basis.

by US draft resistor

(UPI) The government urged
the Board of Immigration Appeals
Monday to uphold the unique
deportation of an American-born
citizen on the ground that he
renounced his citizenship to avoid
serving in the Vietnam war.

Thomas Glenn Jolley, 24, who
now lives in Atlanta, was ordered
deported after the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, INS,
found he ﬂed to Canada “with the
hot breath of the draft at his
back," then renounced his U‘S’
citizenship while in Toronto.

The case is unique in the
Vietnam war and may be
unprecedented in all U.S.wars. No
similar cases are pending.
advisement. Decisions usually take
about two months.

The main question before the
board appeared to be whether

Jolley, who had unsuccessfully
sought conscientious objector
status, renounced his citizenship
voluntarily or under pressure of
Army service.

He wrote his draft board from
Toronto April 7, l967, seeking a
conscientious objector
classification. Instead, the board
notified him April 18 that he had
been classified 1A.

According to the INS, Jolley
took his wife to the US.
Consulate in Toronto May l6,
1967, and formally renounced his
citizenship. The next day he
mailed his Selective Service cards
back to his draft board with
uletter saying he had renounced
his citizenship"thus terminating
all obligation to the United
States."

EDITORS N01":

for those who feel that a particular viewpoint or

Issue has been neglected In the coverage bf this paper,

we are happy to slim space In the terns ct rhlscolosnn, “violations: Mr. loll stated his desire to bring to

publlc attention the current method of selecting the
column. ‘ , _ _ .

In selecting someone to fill the Presidency of this
institution, the Search Committee is determining a
large body of future University policy. The new
president will strongly influence the several
directions in which the University will grow.
Undergraduate education on the whole could even
fall victim to an emphasis on showy contract-getting
graduate studies. Our long history of an amicably
accessable and ﬂexible administration could change
with a president who is more at home with bankers
than with students.

Considering the weight of the implications
proceeding from the choice of who is the new
president, and considering our tradition of working
things out together, it is worth considering the
process by which our next president is being chosen.
The University Council, that little known body of
busy, corporate-commercial legal oriented,
civic-bound citizens is ultimately responsible for the
decision.

It, however, has delegated the real work of this to
its Search Committee, composed of three University
Councellors, three Faculty Senators, and three
students. Unfortunately, its work has been done
almost in secret, since if one’s mime were discussed
openly, as being under consideration, but didn‘t
make it, it would show that the individual is not
content with where he is now. Although this elitist,
upper class rule of protocol is not democratic, and
does not make for openness, it probably is
insurmountable.

What should have been done however, was to
open up the orginal discussions as to what kind of
man we desire.

The structure of the process presents a facade of
democracy. The Committee does include
representatives from faculty, students, and Council,
on an equal basis, and has considered anyone
suggested for the office. This degree of democracy is
to be commended,, but it isn’t enough. Real
participation by either faculty or by students was
not provided. The representatives could in no real
sense represent anyone, since they could not talk
names.

Student Association, quietly decided its three

Precldent of this Unlvorslty. The following is his guest

representatives at the cabinet level without public
knowledge. / , r -

It should have elected its delegates through
Central Council or through general elections, on the
basis of the representatives' conceptions of the
presidency. Since that wasn’t done, once the student
representatives were named, they should» have
openly solicited student opiniona.

Behind a structure which permits a body such as
the University Council to choose the University
President, likely is a top down, paternalistic

r" of the l' ' '_,, which that
some E. Big Somebody knows what is good for
students to know, and that if students want to
know that body of whatever, then they can come
and learn it.

The University should respond to the individual
learner. That is what it is here for. It isn’t here for
the University Council, or for the administration, or
for IBM, or GM, or the State Assembly, or for
anybody else.

As stated in Faculty Handbook, the Council on
Educational Policy of Faculty Senate shall consider,
“...major policy matters as seem appropriate.” It
certainly seems that the filling of the presidency
constitutes major policy and is appropriate. Policy
Council represents students, faculty, and
administration.

University Council intrinsically represents none
of these. Its composition primarily represents
interests outside even the educational realm, yet it
has ultimate control over the choice of the
president.

It would seem that Educational Policy Council
should then automatically haVe a review power on
the final decision, if not a veto, or more. The
University Council should give both studentsand
faculty is legal option of a veto on its decision. If
such an option is not given, and if the choice is
seriously antithetical to the desires of large numbers
of students, they would have few orderly options
open to reverse the decision.

Soon the new president will be announced. It
probably will be a fine choice, but the process by
which the choice is being made has not been worthy
enough of this University.
