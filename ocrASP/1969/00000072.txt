Judaic historian

to discuss

By Bruce Lorence

In recognition of a program in
Judaic studies being introduced
this fall, the Departments of
Comparative Literature and
Romance Languages will present a
lecture by Professor Cecil Roth,
“The Marranos in Europe," at
4:00 pm. on Monday, April 28,
in the Assembly Hall of the
Campus Center.

Regarded by academicians as
one of the two or three most
eminent living historians of
Judaism and the Jewish people,
Dr. Roth is the author of more
than a dozen books dealing with
the Jewish people. Presently, he is
Visiting Professor of History at
the City University of New York.

Cecil Roth has written several
works on just the Marranos alone,
including: “Spanish Inquisition,"
“History of the Marranos,"
"L’Apotre des Marranes," and
others.

The Marranos, stemming from
the period of the Inquisition in
Europe, are secret Jews whose
families have long ’ ‘ ' ‘ a
public alliance with or loyalty to
Christianity in order to protect
themselves from seVere
persecution and even death

Cecil Roth has conducted
extensive researches in neglected
and documentary sources, and has
brought many facts to light on
subjects generally regarded as
exhaustively explored. But he also
regards history as capable of
Influencing the thinking of the
rising generation and thus of the
whole wogld. u

When the basis' "'of attacks
against Judaism was transformed
from the religious into the
historical, in the 1930’s, Roth
demanded that Jewish history be
thrust into the forefront of the
struggle.

The significance of Dr. Roth's
lecture is two-fold. This is the first
lecture ever to be held at Albany
State; dealing with a Jewish
subject and discussed by a Jewish
scholar with expertise in the field.

Secondly, this lectur is

Marrano

designed to be the introduction of
a program in Judaic studies to
begin in the fall. It should be
pointed out that the securing of
Professor Roth for this lecture
was arranged in large part through
the good offices of Professor
Herman Prins Salomon
(Department of Romance
Languages) and, of course,
Professor Carl Odenkirchen
(Chairman, Department of
Comparative Literature ).

Following the lecture and a
question and answer period, a
reception will be tendered in Dr.
Roth‘s honor by the SUNYA
Hillel Society in the Main Lounge
of the Campus Center from 5:30
pm. to 6:30 pm.

 

     
 

"an r
1 r

By Kevin]; McGirr
If we take a step back and look
around at what seems to be
.‘nebulous flux we might find that
there is form or direction to this
constant activity. What sometimes
seems to be really static and only'
circular is actually the unfolding
of _our own. . identities. The
experience of collge is 1a retreat
from "reality" and a period of
intellectual questioning (yes, even
at Albany). Such was the
substance of Dr. James Marcia's,
psychology Professor at SUNY
Buffalo, lecture on the “Identity
Crises."

What sometimes can sound like
psychological jargon or lofty
theory, Marcia renders quite
comprehensable. His presentation
of the early adulthood experience
has empirical credence which We
can find in each other.

Marcia, explaining Erikson's
theory, shows that college is no
longer the period of acceptance or
of taking from the society but a
time when we must give. We must
give ourselves to the society and
decide upon how we will present
ourselves. We must decide upon
an occupation and make
committments to our own
personal philosophy.

In the American society the
decisions are difficult. So many
individuals are exposed to higher
learning yet the tradition of

merican society makes them
submissive to its institutions.
These can be difficult decisions
and the most comfortable way to
avoid them would be to adjust
and remain sane. When we
experience new ideas and decide
upon our parent's ideals this is
what Erikson calls “foreclosure.”
The individual who questions,
cannot accept, and is unsure
about goals is going through
"moratorium."

Moratorium is a very difficult
time for the individual. The

rson is striving towards new
ideals, ideals that he is not
absolutely sure about. At the
same time, in a very basic and
emotional sense, the individual
does not want to lose touch with

He struggles to create the new
identity, syn theslzing the old and

slgns _ of uncertainty;
experimentation with drugs.
espouaal of various philosophies,
and an overall hostility to the‘
society. He’s grappling with the
large, impersonal institution and
hoping for all sorts of change.

The individual who foreclosure
on the intellectual experience is
more responsive ,to, the outside
society; He is perhaps our
fraternity brother or student
council representative. He takes
up the more traditional modes of
college experience. He ,remains
relatively oblivious to the new
ideas presean before him. He
enters college wtih specific
aspirations and attitudes and
leaves with the same. He decides
that he will fit into the mold that
his parents and society have

created.

Both of these personalities  I

through, moratorium and fall ’ 5

mean" ‘an identity may take
one of twovpaths. One is of the
playboy role where you make no
committments to people, to a
philosophy or to an occupation.
Marcia points out that this is:
often the American hero.~The
other path will be that of the
individual who becomes a loner,
failing to communicate with
people, and perhaps becoming
schizophrenic.- " '

It is interesting to see how
individuals can be I classified,
making adjustment to life seem
very insignificant. Standing
outside of the everyday activity
one might feel that things are
pretty ugly but then, this is really
only a value iudaement. Somehow
if one is to survive he must adjust
or face the possibility of
conﬁnement.

ikill Tournament

provides debate twist

By Barry Kirschner
Staff Reporter

The Forensics Union of Albany
State had the honor of sponsoring
a revolution in debate this past.
weekend, with their first annual
Dippikill Tournament. The
tournament contained a radical
departure from the rigidity of
traditional debate, providing the
participants with unlimited
freedom in the selection and
argumentation of topics.

The atmosphere of the
Dippikill Tournament was one of
complete freedom.; In contrast to
traditional tournaments, which
emphasize competition,
worthwhile social and educational
experience were emphasized at
Dippikill. An attempt was made at
obtaining real communication
which rarely exists today.

With its stress on individual
freedom, the activities at Dippikill
allowed debaters to perform at

Sorenson in Albany appearance

defends his political writings

By Tom Monteleon

a n no

and adviser to Presiderit Kennedy,

spoke at the Albany institute of ;

History and Art Tuesday evening.
Dr. Robert S. Herman, Chairman
of the Economics Department at
Union College, introduced
Sorensen.

The topic of Sorenscn's speech
was “The Political Biography."
The former Presidential advisor
began by stating that it is
“imperative that authors use the
exact word" when writing either
biographies or autobiographies.

Sorensen was chosen one of the
ten most outstanding American
men in 1961 and is the author of
two books, “Decision Making In
The White House" and
“Kennedy.”

As Sorensen continued he cited
his books as examples and
defended these works against
different types of criticism.

“There are three types of critics
of political biographies," the
speaker announced; first, those
that claim that the books come
out too soon, before the people

can really decide for themselves or
know the exact effects a recent
official might have had while in
office.

Sorensen countered this
criticism by stating that “there are
lessons to be learned now from
both the accomplishments and
mistakes of former
office-holders."

The second type of critic
Sorensen mentioned is the one
who claims that the authors reveal
too much in their books, possibly
endangering national security and
interfering with current
diplomatic affairs.

Sorensen agreed that caution
must be used to insure the
security of our country and its
allies; also, only relevant facts
should be covered in works
concerning national figures. All
official secrets should be omitted,
too.

As a conclusion to his prepared
speech, Sorensen stated that since
our problems are man made, they
can be solvedby man; that he has
confidence in the American
people, that they will persist and
prevail to overcome those
problems that we face today.

their maximum capabilities. The
opportunity to express their true
conviction on topics of their
choice, was another aspect of the
tournament presean to the
participants.The common practiCs
of jockeying for speaker points
over trivialities was not evident. It
is true that some debaters found it
difficult to cope with the
freedom.

Whereas traditional debate is
rated by a judge’s numerical
evaluations, the ‘revolutionary
tournament' was peer judged. This
allowed for the debate to be
centered on significant features of
the topic rather than on small
detail. It also eliminated the
inevitable ‘bad decisions.’ As
rewards, instead of the usual
trophies, cowhides were given,
symbolizing the unique nature of
the tournament. The anxieties and
animositics usually present during
the announcement of the results,
were non-existent.

The ultimate purpose, that of
establishing meaningful
communications among people,
seemd to be accomplished. The
atmosphere was conducive to a
genuine communication, both
during and ln-between rounds.
The ‘close-to-nature’ atmosphere
at Dippikill seemed to help create
a friendliness absent at other
tournaments. While it is not
atypical for debaters to meet only
during competition, the
participants at Dippikill
maintained a warm relation
throughout the week-end.

As is inevitable in any
revolutionary activity, there were
some reactionary features at the
Dippikill Tournament. Topics
such as Resolved: DEBATE IS
lNSIDIOUS TWADDLE, seemed
to produce little of constructive
value. Some of those who
appeared unable to handle their
acquisition of freedom interested
themselves more in the social than
the educational experiences
offered. Even the weather which
was cold and damp seemed to be a
reaction to the warm and sunny
days which preceded the
tournament.

The Dippikill Tournament was
a revolutionary attempt at
establishing communication
through the granting of individual
freedom. It offerred a unique
social and educational
experience, far different than any
tournament in this section of the
country. it was a breakthrough in
communication through debate.
something obviously needed
throughout the traditional debate
circuit.
