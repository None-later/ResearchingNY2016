monitoring Its system, and maintaining Its memory.

Another Frankenstein monster? No, a CDC 3100..

Prior to the computer's arrival In June 1968, six
people. provided the needed data processing services.

Today, as the center prepares for the installation of -

l a "new, larger computer, two members of this
- original staff are assisting in the transition: Al
krone, Senior Computer Operator, and Hilda
Scanlon, Key Punch Supervisor.
The! present system is under the direction of (Dr.

Edwin Reilly, whose staff has expanded from one to'

over forty.

Accordingrto Dr. Reilly, "the computercenter has
a three-fold mission--curricular support,
administrative data processing, and faculty and
student research." .

Curricular support refers to the processing of
problem submitted by students enrolled in
Computer Science courses.ComputerScience, under
the chairmanship of Dr. Reilly, as an academic
department in the College of Arts and Sciences is
distinct from the Computing Center although
several persons hold appointments in the center and
the department.

Dr. Federighi, Assistant Director for Academic
Services, supervises the ‘ ' f ‘ _ '
of studenbfaculty use of the computing facilities.
For example, the Computing Center actively
supported the SECT project through the services of
Mr. Pfeiffer, Research Manager, and Mrs. Clawson,
Test Scoring Supervisor.

One outstanding aspect of the Center is the
number of students employed. There are
twelve student assistants who aid other students in
the use of the computer, 3 student operators, plus
student file clerks, ‘ ' , an r u ' _,
assistants. Mr. Burgess, Manager of Student Services,
is not exaggerating in saying that students “certainly
provide a very significant contribution to the
operation of the Center."

The volume of Administrative Data Processing
(ADP) has grown tremendously as the University

day‘ men ‘are kept busy feeding it, ,

ADP Development, is responsiblefor maintaining
efficient processing of information from the

cards'proceued per semester-from 30,000 in 1967

.to over 60,000 today. This expansion has been
handled smoothly'under the capable programming
of Mr. Gary Oberlander. ‘

The important responsiblity for quality control
of the reports processed through the Center is
entrusted to Mr. Graham Burrell, Manager of Data
Scheduling and Control. V

With the added demands placed on the
Computer, the Center now operates 24 hours per
day, 5 days per week, and for 16 hours on Saturday.
Mr. Dan Grygas, Supervising Computer Operator,
has mannged to keep ahead of the flood of
information which needs processing.

The typical Computing Center, according to Dr.
Reilly, employs people in several distinct capacities,
but their duties are sometimes confused by persons
not closely acquainted with the field. For example,
a keypunch operator prepdres data for machine
processing by using a keyboard device to encode
data as a series of holes on punched cards. A
computer programmer devises step-bystep
instructions which direct the computer to solve a
r ' ' in a particular way.

The data from the keypunch sections plus the
program written by the programmer are combined
and actually run through the computer by a
computer operator. The finished results are either
returned directly to the student or faculty member,
or are given to Data Control for inspection by data
control clerks in the case of administrative requests.
All of the above job positions are filled by
university employees, as contrasted with the site
,' who maintains and repairs the machine and
is an employee of Control Data Corporation.

The Computing Center at the University has been
fortunate in attracting key persOnnel. Examining
the list of the Center's employees, one ﬁnds Phd’s
from outstanding schools such as Harvard,
Columbia, N.Y.U. and RPI.

lsyed John Cage's music for prepared piano last night to a packed audience in

   

the newly opened Perform ng Arts Center. For an intensive look at Cage‘s music, see story on this page.

John Cage: pioneer in

---Benjamin

pop-art

prominent avant-garde artist

by Joe Pehrson

(CPS)--With some degree of
temerity, Columbia Records
recently released a series of

contemporary works by major
avant-garde composers which
presents a crosssection of
developments in the ﬁeld of
modern music.

While none of these records are
destined for even the higher
numbers on the popularity charts,
they do reflect a growing interest,
particularly of younger people, in
modern classical music and the
popvart sound.

Variations ll (MS 7051) by
John Cage presents what sounds
like David Tudor, Cage‘s pianist,
vainly trying to put his model
train back on the track. The image
is complete as Tudor gleefully
plays with what sounds like a
train transformer, delighting in
both feedback and short-circuit.

To make some type of sense
from this seemingly utonal
gibberish, it is necessary to
understand a few concepts of
Cage's work.

Noise is music. There is no
reason why a "pure" sound is any
more beautiful than the sound of
a subway, or the sound of
someone falling off a stepladder.
We tend to associate our ideas of
beauty only with the sounds in a
concert situation or the sounds
produced by conventional,
“appropriate” musical
instruments.

The sounds of everyday living
are generally overlooked. We find
our own beauty, and,
traditionally, beauty must not be
found in anything utilitarian.

Sound is indeterminate. Sounds
of the external environment may
occur at any instant and are
practically infinite in their variety.
The beauty here lies in the
unpredicted, In the astonishment
and awe of an unexpected sound.

These sounds should be
considered isolated events,
punctuuting time and silence.

Sounds which are forced upon
one unother by u composer are
considered to be much too
subjective to be bountiful.

Silence is beautiful. On this
point, any aficionados of John
Cup will agree. Sounds, noises
Included, separate and defined
silences.

Bilences, in Cagc's work often
provide opportunities for further
indeterminate occurrences. A
stray cough placed by any
member of the sudlence at any
univeclfied Instant .Is welcomed.

Cage, as a composer, attempts

particularly profound in the area

complete chance modeled after
Oriental philosophy and Zen. The
Oriental practice of consisting
chance happenings and
philosophy, can be seen in
Variations II (1961). This score
consists of superimposing six
transparent plastic sheets on one
another and dropping
perpendicular lines from certain
points on the sheet. Measurements
of these lines are used to
determine amplitude, frequency,
duration, timbre, and structure of
the event.

This composition can be
"realized" or performed by any
number of players or by any
sound-producing means. In this
particular recording, David Tudor
has placed contact microphones
and phone cartridges on the
strings of his piano. in addition,
microphones and cartridges are
attached to toothpicks, plastics
and pipe cleaners. These may be
scraped or rubbed on the strings
at the discretion of the performer.
This process, plus the unrestrained
imagination of Tudor, accounts
for the strange array of sounds,
many of which could be quite
irritating.

Cugc insists one must be in it
special frume of mind when
listening to music, or observing a
work of art. As becomes clear by
the nature of his music, this frami-
of mind is more an appreciation
of the environment. The
composer has no special function
other than u collector of sound;
he should be a listener, surprised
and pleasantly startled by his
chalice operation.

“i like to Lhink...thut I'm
outside the circle of a known
universe and dealing with things I
literally don't know anything
about," Cage suys.

Cnge's inﬂuence has been
to provide and invent situations of
of visual art. Even though this is a
separate medium, it is but another
type of the same mode of
perception. Cage is often
considered the father of pop-art,
and has presented concerts
containing both visual alld audio
stimuli.

The ideal approach to the
music of John Cage is reflected in
a Zen observation he uses
frequently: “If something is
boring after two minutes, try It
for four. if it is still boring, try it
for eight. If after eight minutes it
is still boring, try it for sixteen,
thirty-two, sixty-four, and so on.
Eventually one finds it is not
boring at all, but extremely
interesting."

by

Ralph Nelson's CHARLY is an
annual story heightened by
unusual photography and editing
Cliff Robertson’s Academy Award

winning performance is so great

that the almost science-fiction, like
plot ls nearly believable.
The value of the film should

not, be judged however. by its
'realiatic or non-realistic story

lines. Something must be said for
the director who through the use
of poetic license can made a
commendable film which is based
on romantic, idealized theme.
Despite" criticism that the basic
Idea, a moran becoming a genius,
is a bit far-fetched by today's

“realistic” standards, CHARLY
still has much to offer any
movie-goer.

The characters are human.
There is a very real and human
desire to learn found in Charly.
The doctors programming his
Intellectual and emotional
development represent a
distinction so evident in the
disparity between male-female
interest and concern.

Claire Bloom as Mrs. Kinnion is
by far the most complex character
aside from Charly. She becomes
an ideal paragon of virtue and
compassion in contrast to her
more scientific minded colleagues.
Her role is one of complete
involvement and dedication for
some higher purpose than prestige
and knowledge-mankind on an
individual, personal level. This is
an ideal not frequently sought or
achieved in an age of technology
and "realistic" approaches to
solve the ills of the world.

Unfortunately the ending is
anticlimatic, cliched and
predictable and yet somehow
almost necessary. Claire Bloom's
offer to marry Charly and his
refusal are the romantic things to
do. These actions save their lyric
romance from the decadence of
reality.

to lecture Mon.

Dr Gyorgy Szekely, the
1968-69 Agnes E. Futterer
Lecturer in Dramatic Art, will
present the last in a series of
public lectures, Monday, April
28th at 8:30 pm in the Studio
Theatre of the University
Performing Arts Center.

“The Tragedy of Man," a
dramatic poem by irme Madach,
an outstanding Hungarian
playwright of the middle 19th
century, will be the topic of Dr.
Szekely's lecture. Dr. Szekely will
speak regarding the relation of
irme Madach’s poem to the tragic
idea as we view it some hundred
years later.

Dr. Szekely came to the State
University at Albany from
Hungary in the fall of 1968.!"

in NOVember of this school
year Dr. Szekely presented a
public lecture called: “Passion and
intellect; Highlights in the History
of Theatre." During this lecture
he traced recuring patterns
through out the world which have
contributed to the formation of
theatrical art.

The Agnes E. Futter Lectures
are sponsored by the Theatre
A l u mni Association in
cooperation with the Department
of Speech and Dramatic Art at
Albany.
