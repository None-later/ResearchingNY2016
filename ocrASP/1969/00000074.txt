Tennis Play On Weekend

by Dave Fink

The Frshman Track Squad competed in its first meet in Albany
State history Wednesday andcame out of it with quite a bit of
experience, a lot of valuable knowledge and two big points. State’s
thoughts in entering the meet were that it would be a purely
educational experience as they would be competing against such fine
contingents as Cornell, Colgate, Syracuse, and Cobleskill. This was not
the case. The 880 relay team finished fourth.

The contingent of Irwin Pers, Mark Ascher, Bob Pryba, and Ed
Fludd more than held there own in the race. The 440 relay team,
which was winning its preliminary heat, lost as a result of a poor
baton pass.

The Freshman Golf Team also had their Iirstmatch on Wednesday.
The squad competed in a quadrangular match against
Fulton-Montgomery C.C., Herklrner 0.0., and New Paltz State at their
home course, McGregor Country Club. Not playing up to par, the
team defeated both New Paltz and Fulton-Montgomery while losing
to Herkimer. Don Suhockl was the low scorer for State with a fine 84.

This Saturday, there will be a Freshman tennis match against Siena
while the freshman baseball team travels to Oneonta for a
doubleheader.

The Liberal Party in New York
City has endorsed the Lindsay
ticket for .tbe.,upcoming elections
in Novembe'r-vwlthout a primary,
or even giving the other
contenders a hearing! Bronx Rep.
James'Scheuer, a contender for
both the Liberal and Democratic
nominations for Mayor,
denounced the Liberal convention
as “a boss-ridden farce-it made
last summer’s Democratic national
convention look good."

Rep. Scheuer is attacking
former Mayor Wagner as hard as
Mayor Lindsay and is setting out
to document “the failures of the
Wagner Administration, which,
combined with Lindsay's
ineffectiveneu, have led New
York City to its present desperate
plight."

Scheuer vows he is in the
Democratic Mayoral sweepstakes
to stay and has demanded that
Wagner withdraw from the race
because “he is incapable of giving
the dynamic, creativity. and
leadership" needed in New York.
He said today’s crises call for far
more than an “elder statesman"
such as Wagner.

Scheuer has been endorsed by
24 political clubs, and is running a
campaign similiar to the one run
by Lindsay four years ago. He is
opening 70 storefronts in the five
boroughs, and plans to spend
$500,000 on television alone.

Scheuer is bitter at Wagner for
attempting to divide the
Democratic reform movement.

---Benjamr'n

Occasionally I have an
opportunity to see some gross
physical effects of apathy on this
campus. Early this past Sunday
afternoon was just such an
occasion.

After spending an enjoyable
hour on the not yet deapolled
lawn behind the Campus Center, I
moved to the lawn area, in the
center of Colonial Quad. There I
sat back to enjoy the view; I saw
many diamonds sparkling in the

grass. Unfortunately, they turned ’

out to be pieces of glass broken
from bottles and light bulbs. It
was a harrowing experience in the
light of the fact that dozens of
people walk and play bare-footed
in this area.

When I was young, I lived on a
farm in the Midwest;aprg farm;
There is a novel thing about pigs;
people think that they are
naturally sloppy. I don 't believe
that this is so. When they aren't
conﬁned, and given enough food
to live, they turn out to be very
clean animals. ' .

I'm afraid that we are the only
animals who deliberately choose
to live in filth. The analogy about
being born in a barn doesn't hold
for people: barnyard animals are
clean compared to some of us.

- Soon, the new alcohol policy
will be in effect on this campus.
Personally, I am waiting
expectantly to see what la done
with the empty containers, not
the beverages they contain.

Nature, with some “help” from
3D. Stone, has eatabliabe'd'a very
pleasant natural order here.~0no
need only be present over” a
vacation weekend to see what the
campus'looka‘ likewlth all of the

garbage gone. Awareness of thh ,

precious onvironment la the moat
importlnt part of our treatment
of our environment. ,

Here is a quote from Erich
Fromm's new book, “The
Revolution of Hope," which is
somewhat to the point on this
issue.

“Man is not bound to be sheep.
In fact, inasmuch as he is not an
animal, man has an interest in
being related to and conscious of
reality, to touch the earth with his
feet, as in the Greek legend of
Antaeus; man is stronger the more
fully he is in touch with reality.
As long as he is only sheep and his
reality is essentially nothing but
the fiction built up by his society
for more convenient manipulation
of men and things, he is weak as a
man."

Indian women achieve
greater emancipation

By Judy Novicky

“The past fifteen years of
Indian history has brought about
a great change in the role of
women in Indian society." This
changing role was the topic of a

lecture given by Dr. Desai,
presently a Visiting Assistant
Professor in Asian Studies at
Skidmore.

Her speech, “Indian

Women—Response to
Emancipation," was the final
lecture in the South Asian
Seminar Series, given Tuesday in
the Assembly Hall.

Dr. Desai, a native of Bombay,
expressed the meaning of
emancipation to the women of
India and described the effects of
rapid modernization upon such
things as the traditional concept
of marriage, the traditional family
system, and the revolutionary
progress made in women‘s
education and employment.

previously had been socially
forbidden in Indian society, is
becoming widely accepted.
Similarly, the extended, joined
family structure is weakening as
more women are beginning to
prefer a modified form of family
structure.

Dr. Desai feels that Indira
Ghandi, the present prime
minister of India, reflects many of
the ideals which Indian women
are striving to achieve. That is,
many more women are entering
into professional fields and public
employment, and more women
are beginning to share an interest
in politics.

Dr. Desai is head of the.
Department of Sociology at
S.N.D.T. Women’s University in
Bombay. She has -written' two
books, entitled WOMEN IN
MODERN INDIA and WOMAN
IN INDIA SOCIETY.
