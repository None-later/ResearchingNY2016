Harpnrplans new gOVernment

Binghsrnton, » N.Y. (l.P.)-’I‘he
State University of New York at
Binghamton has released the
report of the Committee on
University Governance. The
committee, a 40-member body
that has been meeting since
October 1968, foresees an
all-University Assembly with
membership in the ratio of five
faculty members to three students
to two administrators.

The committee proposed a new
system of. governance, attempting
to institutionalize the concept of
the university as a community.

The most outstanding feature
of the plan is the University
Assembly. This body would be
“the major deliberative body of
the University to deal with
interscholsstic and all-University
matters.” It would be composed

of faculty, students, and
administrators in the ratio of
5-3-2 respectively.

The Presidents of the United
Student Government and of the
Graduate Student Organization
would be ex-officio voting
members of the Assembly,

counted as part of the
administrative representation.

The University Assembly is
expected to have a membership of
approximately 100. Thus, there
would be 60 faculty members, 30
students, and 20 administrators.
Representation for graduate and
undergraduate students would be
apportioned on full time
equivalent basis. The President of
the University would preside over
the Assembly.

The C.U.G. Report also
recommends the establishment of
standing University Assembly
committees to deal with ,these
areas: Admissions, Administrative
Appointments, Budget Review,

Faculty Personnel, and
Long-Range Planning.
Two permanent committees

dealing with Social Regulations
would also be established. These
committees would also report to
the Assembly, but would differ
from the standing committees in
that not all their members would
have to come from that body.
The Educational Policies
Committee would be composed of
six faculty. three students, and

two administrators. It would be
responsible for the development
of University-wide and
interscholsstic educational policy
and would administer a poll of
resources that could be used to
finance experimental courses.

The University Admissions
Committee would} supervise and
approve admissions standards and
requirements for the various
programs of the University. it
would be composed of faculty,
students, and administrators in
the ration 3-2-1.

The Administrative
Appointments Committee would
be advised by the President of all
administrativa vacancies and
terminations. It could recommend
that the Assembly establish
appropriate committees to advise
the President on specific
appointments and terminations.

The committee could also
advise the President to create new
administrative posts. It would be
composed of equal representation
from faculty, undergraduate
students, graduate students, and
administration.

The University Budget Review
Committee would serve as an
advisory committee rather than as

a legislative committee. It would
discuss budget priorities with the
administration throughout the
evolution of the budget. It would
also try to encourage student and
faculty participation in the
budget-making process at the

earliest stages. it would be
composed of eight faculty
members, two undergraduates,

and two graduates, and as many
non-voting administrators as the
President deemed necessary.

The. Assembly Faculty
Personnel Committee- would
receive recommendations on
faculty tenure, promotion,
renewal, or termination from
departmental faculty personnel
committees and from
departmental student personnel
committees.

These recommendations would
be considered by the committee
which would hear “the views of
faculty, students, and
administration either separately
or, if all parties agree, together."

If agreement cannot be
reached, the Assembly Faculty
Personnel Committee shall rise to
executive session to make the
ﬁnal decision. The committee
would forward each case with its
decisions to the President for his
implementation, If the President
finds he cannot implement the
committee's decision, he would
meet with the committee and
review the case. The Assembly
Faculty Personnel Committee is

to consist solely of faculty
members.

The Long-Range Planning
Committee would initiate

proposals that require long-range
planning, and receive such
proposals from the President. it
could also recommend that the
Assembly appoint committees to
study specific long-range plans.

dis cusses
by Judy Novicky

“The U.S.S.R. and the United
States must co-operate in the
prevention 'of a world-wide famine
which should begin between 1975
and 1980." This is’one of the
issues raised by Andrei Sakharov,
one of the top Soviet scientists, in
his controversial document which
‘caused his dismissal from various
Soviet positions. _

Sakharov and his manifesto,
“Progress, Peaceful Coexistence,
and Academic Frredomﬂ were
the topics of a lecutre given
Friday by Dr. Albert Parry,
Professor of Russian Civilization
and Language at Colgate
University.

In his speech, “From Russia
With Sense: The Voice of
Academician Andrei Sakharov,
Dr. Parry gave the basic substance
of Sskharov's document,
described the underground
methods used to distribute it, and
mentioned both Soviet and
American reactions to it.

Sakharov, known as “the father
of the Soviet hydrogen bomb"
because he was chieﬂy responsible
for its development, demanded in
this 12,000 word document, an
end to cold war hostilities,
freedom of intellectual discussion
and information, and co-operation
between the Soviet Union and the
United States for the good of
humanity. Sakharov castigated
Soviet leaders for their
neo-Stalinism and chided both the
US. and Soviet Russia for their
militarism and imperialism.

Dr. Parry mentioned three
points which Sakharov strongly
urged as areas of co-operation
between Moscow and Washington,
He urged complete co-operation
in the prevention of (1) nuclear
war, (2) world wide famine, and
(3) world-wide air, water and soil
pollution.

Sakharov has refused to
conform and become a “pet of

Solarz to talk
about abortion
law repeal

Should the existing abortion
law be repealed? Steve Solarz, a
25-year old Assemblyman from
Brooklyn’s 45th District will
explore this question tonight at
7:30 at an open meeting of the
University’s New Democratic
Coalition in HU 124.

Solarz, who was elected to the
assembly in the general election of
1968, is a member of the political
science faculty of New York City
Community College. He did his
undergraduate work at Brandeis
University and received his
masters degree in public law and
government from Columbia
University.

Solurz will also address himself
to the 1969 Legislative Session
and the failures that it hus
encountered.

the Kremlin." Because his
literature cannot be published it is
“self-published" which means it is
mimeographed, xeroxed, or
photographed and transmitted
from friend to friend.

Dr, Parry cited numerous cases
of Soviet scientists who had been
imprisoned, exiled, kept in insane
asylums, or had committed
suicide because their ideas failed
to conform to those of the state.
Sakharov, however, is too valuable
to be arrested, and has instead
been confined to-limited activity.
As Dr. Parry understands it, “the
Soviets need scientists more than

iets

sum sruosN‘rrssss
- 5'0?  " 
the scientists need Sovlctism."
Sskharov's document has been
published in America and has met
with both criticism and appraisal.
The major point of criticism is its
stress upon socialism, but Dr.
Parry feels that most American

criticism is. “concerned with
details rather than the heart of the

 

, document.”

Dr. Parry who is a leading
authority on Soviet affairs,
expecially Soviet science and
technology, has sent suggestions
to the Nixon Administration for
the use of this document in future
foreign relations with Russia.

Collins dis cusses

pertinent

by Gale McAllister
staff reporter

President Collins announced at
the President's Conference wit
Students yesterday who
Commencement Speaker will be
and discussed other issues with
students.

Stewart Udall, former Secretary
of the Interior and a noted
conservationist will speak for this
year's graduating class. His speech
will in all probability be
concerned with conservation on
the world-wide level.

Collins,when asked to comment
on the present dilemma in the
Psychology Department
concerning Dr. Waterman and
Mrs. Rhoads, stated that he was
glad to see students that were
interested enough to actively
participate in the affairs of their
Department.

This brought up the wider
question of the general lack of
student participation in virtually
all Departments. Participation is
encouraged, but it is up to the
students themselves to take due
initiative, preferably prior to any
disagreements that might arise in
an attempt to prevent what
happened in the Psychology
DEpartmcnt.

Collins cleared up the issue of
the compromise system of grading
that would include ideas from
both the prcscnt system and the
proposed pass-fail system by
saying that it is all speculation as
to what will result.

One student asked if the Search
Committee had selected a new
President for the University.

issues

President Collins described their
progress by saying they are now in
the “intermediate interview

stage.”

This simply means that the
Search Committee has narrowed
the field to a few interested
candidates and is close to
choosing the new President. When
asked how close, President Collins
estimated about three to four
weeks.

The President's salary was
briefly discussed and Dr. Thorns
stated that “in asurvey, President
Collins came out on the bottom"
in reference to his yearly salary.
This survey, of course, compared
Universities of the same size.

Most University Presidents get
in excess of the $30,000 that
Collins receives and are provided
with a house.

A question arose about
discrimination against non-Greeks
in the hiring of students for work
in the Campus Center. President
Collins said he did not know this
to be fact, but would look into
the matter.

At the same time, a question
was raised as to whether there was
discrimination against Blacks in
hiring Resident Assistants, and
Directors. This matter will also be
looked into.

At the close of the Conference,
Collins announced that Mixers can
once again be held, but
supervision must be tighter in
order to prevcnt the trouble with
“townies.”

Budget cuts, priorities
wreak havoc on SOc.

The following are excerpts
from a letter addressed to
President Collins from Dr. Paul
Meadowa, chairman of the
combined Sociology and
Anthropology Department, and
has been fully endorsed by the
members of these two
departments. it is published for
your greater appreciation of the
effects which the recent State
University system budget cuts and
determined priorities of our
Administration have had upon
two of the departments of this
institution.

“Next fall registrations in this
Department will be over 3.500.
Last fall they were over 2,100.

“Last fall we offered 61
courses; next fall we may be able
to offer. if present plans hold, 65.

“Last fall we had 22 1/3 staff
members. This fall we have,
according to budget information
reaching me, 17%. We have
the highest student-faculty ratio
in this University. ...on the basis
of pre-registration figures, our raw
facultystudent ratio will rise next
fall from 1 :95 to 1 1200"

Many persons at this University
have been given the impression
that S.U.N.Y. at Albany was
selected from the University
system to be developed as the
center of Social Sciences of the
University system.
