THESE LOVELY LADIES (Kay Kraft, Claudine Conan and Ro
Cania) rehearse a number as“l’rotest In the Arts" prepares for its

opening

 

by Warren Burt

Last Thursday night, purely
through a happy coincidence of
traveling schedules, pianist
William Masselos performed John
Cage's “Sonatoas and Interludes"
for prepared piano. The piece
consists of a number of short
fragments, sonatas in the Scarlatti
sense and 3 interludes scattered
between them. The numbers range
from piano music ala
Rachmaninoff with funny sounds
instead of “normal” ones, to
music that is more on the order of
a percussion ensemble than a
piano work.

The piano was prepared with a
series of rubber erasers/jar sealers,
screws/nuts/boltslpencils and
pieces of woods. Unlike Cage's
later music, everything. except for
the sounds the preparations make.
is very determinate.

The important thing to
remember here though is not that
he has fixed up a piano and made
it sound funny, but that he has
created “new” sonorities, to be
taken seriously and used for their
inherent beauty. Since this work
is early Cage (194B) little of the
sensationalism that has so unjustly
come to distrot the public’s view
of his more recent work was here.
Indeed, nearly all the people who
came and expected to hear weird.
wild psychedelic sounds were
pleasantly disappointed by
hearing music that owed more to
the Romantic era and the ancient
Indonesian gaemlan (percussion
orcestra) than to the era of
pop-art and the happening.

These are quite. exotic, gentle
piece and not loud tasteless
extravagancies with more bluster
than substance.

But how can gentle pieces like
these and wild collages like
Variations lI (reviewed last wee)
and Variations lV (just released
on Everest) be reconciled?

The answer is simply, they
don't need to be. They in
themselves are already united by
two factors. The first is Cage's
constant search for sounds. Not
new sounds, for there are no
“new” sounds. but just sounds.
Any sound that can be made can
be beautiful. The composer when
working. must restrict himself to
only certain sounds. whatever
they may be.

Both “Sonatas and Interludes”
and “Variations IV” are
concerned with the different
types of sounds that are available
from our environment. Thus.

notes, and when he superimposes
a discussion of two English
matrons on love (i.e. “but I insist
that it is not unreal to be in love
for all your life" “But this is what
our young authors are forgetting”
“I can show you hundreds of
examples...etc. ad nauseam;) with
the sound of a toilet flushing, he
is doing just that, finding beauty,
the same old beauty that always
was. just exposing our jaded ears
to it in a new way. Above all. he is
not trying to be the sensationalist
that he is made out to be. He is
merely creating new musical
experiences of beauty, just as
Beethoven or Mozart did.

The second uniting factor is his
impeccable sense of musical
craftsmanship. To the layman it
may not be immediately apparent,
but beneath those bloops, sqckz,
and thuds lies an enormous
amount of work and just plain
musical talent, taste. and
craftsmanship.

The res ult of these two
factors--craftsmanship and the
search for beauty in all sounds
combining is partially (strange as
it may seem) indeterminacy.

This is that philosophy of
Cage‘s which discards the
traditional forms of organizing
and structuring music and
searches for new ones. But in spite
of his adopting of a certain
looseness in his form, he still
remains the same uncompromising
musician as always. For instance.
in his latest piece. for
Harpsichords and 51 tape loop
machines, soon to be released on
Nonesuch. he haggled endlessly
with copyists over mistakes in the
harpsichord parts.

he final combination of all
these "perfect" sounds, however.
he leaves up to chance. and in this
way, bypasses partially his own
ago. But he does not wholly
bypass his ego, for the original
decisions of which materials were
to be used had to be made, and it
is for this that John Cage will be
remembered: his taste. his talent,
and his expansion of musical
resources.

Currently playing at the
Madison theater is a film entitled
"Greetings." Upon entering the
theater don’t be surprised if you
are asked if you are eighteen years
of age-but don’t get your hopes
up because the film is not that
risque. As a matter of fact the
film isn’t even that good. True it
is funny, but it does not approach
hilarious; it stays at the amusing.

As the title will tell you
“Greetings” has to do with good
old Uncle Sam and the message he
hands out. The story is concerned
with three friends who have all
received their induction notices.
They all have their varied methods
of snowing the draft board and
busily practice them for you, the
audience. As the film continues
you get to see the effectiveness of
each plan along with a few
insights into the lifes and
characters of the three gentlemen.

The first character, Paul. keeps
getting into seduction scenes that
he either is tired of or doesn't
know how to handle. He goes
through a series of computer dates
which turn out disasterous each
time. First there is the Bronx
secretary, who spends all day
getting ready for his arrival and
then goes into a tirate as soon as
Paul mentions the word bed. She
goes on and on about what an
oversexed slob he is, how
ungrateful he is for all her hours
of preparation and finally storms
out of the room Paul is
embarassed and slightly ashamed
and he goes to her only to
discover her nude and waiting for
him. So he splits and calls his
friend. Robert.

Now Robert is about the
funniest of the three. He has an
amazing hangsup with the
Kennedy assasination. and

throughout the film he is busv
blowing up photographs and
reading reports and making
measurements (i.e. on the body of
Paul’s Bronx secretary). At one
point in the film Robert is
working in a book store and meets
witness number 17. Noll is in
some obscure way connected with
the assasination (he happened to
be in Dallas when the assasination
took place). He swears he can
crack the case wide open but he
needs the help of Robert. The
stranger tells Robert to meet him
at the Staten island ferry at nine
the next morning. Robert
complies and as a result he gets
shot. Amazingly enough he is just
shot and does a dramatic death

scene.
All in all the film was neither
really that good or that bad. It has
a promising beginning but
somehow it gets aborted. Some of
the satire is really funny and some
is only 50-50. The acting is par and
the situations although
imaginative are not played up to
their fullest advantage.
"Greetings" is the kindoffilm that
you go to see if you have an
afternoon to waste and you want
a few chuckles. Aside from that I
cannot recommend the film

Royal Air Force. Released from
the Air Forcein 1948. he went up
to Oxford University where he
read English Language and
Literature at St. Catherine’s‘
College, graduating with honors in
1 51.

Murray the “K” has had. a
lvaried career, but his career in
show business started when;he
was nine in the world of Eddie
Cantor and Al Jolson. In 1952. he
decided to creates radio show for
himself that would set a new style
for disc jockey shows. In that year
he began on WMCA. which
continued through 1957. then
switched to WINS where he
worked until 1964. This year he
has a radio show on WOR-FM.

Both of these men. eminent in
their fields, are concerned with
what is going on in the’ arts today.
As Murray the “K” says, “There's
a bloodless revolution going on,
particularly in the arts, which
might be called Damn the
Establishment."

“What's the Use"

“What’s the Use,” a cabaret
theatre presentation expressing
the disillusionment and confusion
of today’s youth will take place
Saturday night in the Campus
Center Ballroom.

The form of cabaret theatre is
not new; nightclubs have been
using it for decades. What is new
is that in presenting “What’s the
Use,” various technical facilities
are used to creates unified whole,
a method commonly known as
multi-media. In this combination
of art forms to create a new art
form. lights. sounds, and other
effects are put together to better
express an idea or convey a point.

Sixth Street Theatre

On Sunday the Sixth Street
Theatre will perform

New York's Sixth Street
Theatre has been performing on
the streets in an effort to reach
people other than habitual
theatre-goers. “The troupe makes
plays about familiar social issues
for an audience often
unacquainted with a radical
perspective." This is political
theatre. Theatre for the
movement and for the
uncommitted. They look to
audience for recognition of
common lot; attempt to portray
rise in consciousness. but also
ability to act on a new level.

The presentation by the Sixth
Street Theatre WILL be
“Studentlife.” a play whit. wees
a student’s career from
matriculation to revolt. They will
also offer a workshop in
improvisational theatre. The only
requirement for this is that you be
willing to do, not to watch.
