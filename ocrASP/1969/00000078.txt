Danes Beat Harpur;
Lose Two To Conn

By Dave Fink

The Albany State Varsity
baseball team has picked up some
bad habits. For the second time
this year, the Danes have dropped
both ends of a double-header,
previously to Oswego State and
this weekend to powerful Central
Connecticut.

These twin losses combined
with Friday’s thrillingvictory over
Harpur brought the team to an
overall 5-4 record. .

In Friday’s game, sophomore
Jim Lee singled with two outs and
a count of two strikes in the
bottom of the ninth inning
knocking in two runs to pull out
the victory by a score of 8-7.
Senior hurler George Margan
picked up the victory while also
driving in two runs to help his
own cause.

Clutch hits were also added by
catcher Jim Sandy and outfielder
Rich Spiers.

a. 1:5. “a J found
Central Connecticut too much for
State as they shut out the Danes
in both games. Thus far this
season, Connecticut has defeated
such fine baseball teams as LIU
and Southern Connecticut while

at the same time averaging 13 runs
per game and compiling a team
batting average of .350. According
to Coach Burlingame, they are a
cinch to go to the national post
season tournament.

Girls’ Tennis Wins

A sweeping victory has
provided a grand opening for the
spring season of SUNY’s women's
intercollegiate tennis team. Frigid
temperatures and cloudy skies did
not deter the team of 6 starters
from posting a 4-0 win over Grren
Mountain this past Wednesday.
Playing in the number one singles
spot, Carol Perkins established a
solid win of 6-2, 6-2 over her
opponent. In the number two
position, Georgann Jose decisively
defeated her rival 6-2,6-2. Paired
as the number one doubles

“ in", Sheila Jacobs and
Jean Komig vollcyed their way to
victory, 6-2, 7-5. The number two
doubles duo of Barbara Moshor
and Sally Tucker formed a
fine-hitting combination to take
their march 6-] ,6-2.

.Plattsburgh and Oneonta, 105%,
41%, 34. ’

Don Van Cleve led the

Lacrosse Overcomes BIT;
Play At Home Wednesday

The Albany State Lacrosse
team extended its winning streak
to four games as they outscored
the Rochester Institute of
Technology by a 14-12 total this
past Saturday.

The Danes were once again led
by the high-scoring trio of
Jakway, Smith, and Werder. These
three, who have contributed a
large majority of this year’s goals,
combined for thirteen of the
fourteen goals scored on
Saturday.

According to Mrs. Peggy Mann,
coach of the team, the spring
season has seen a very fine
turnout and the emergence of one

of the strongest teams she has ever
had. The ability and effectiveness
of the women players as a team is
no accident. Three days a week,
Mrs. Mann drills the team in the
fine points of the game as well as
the more basic skills. New depth
has been added to the tennis unit
by the arrival of six new players
who are fast learning the game:
Ronda Small, Sally Tucker,
Audrey Goldberg, Debbie
Copeland, Mac Cunningham, and
Paula Camardella. In addition to
the players against Green
Mountain, the group of retunecs
consists of Belinda Stanton, Cathy
Feger, and Lynn Gabriel.

Each of the three had ten goals
going into the game and Werder
ended the game with six while
Smith scored four and Jakway
three. Werder also contributed
four assts. while Smith had two.

Albany held a half time lead of
10-6, and barely averted a strong
comeback attempt in the second
half. RIT seemed overconﬁdent in
the first half and after realizing
their deficit in the first half tried
in vain to pull the game out as
Albany refused to allow them to
seriously challenge their lead.

The Danes go up against North

'County Community College this

Wednesday at 3 o’clock. The
Danes suffered two important
injuries this week as R. B. Sechrist
and Bob Cole may both miss the
game tomorrow. Sechrist is in the
infirmary, while Cole suffered a
leg injury.

Trackm en Win Two

while Fredericks won the mile and
two-mile runs and Parker copped
the 120-yard and. 440-yard
intermediate hurdles.

Fredericks, just returning from
a pro-season leg injury contributed
an outstanding performance in his
first meet.

The team suffered its fifth loss
of the season on Monday when

‘ they were defeated by Hartwick,
'74-70.

A dropped baton in the
440-yard relay proved the
difference as the Danes would
have won the meet without the
error.

Individual winners for Albany
included George Rolling in the
mile and two-mile, Don Van Cleve
in the shot and discus, Sol
Moshenburg in the long jump, Jim
Setall in the pole vault, Tom Sears
in the high jump and the mile
relay team.

The Danes record now stands at
one win and five losses.

In their first win, besides the
outstanding performances by Van
Cleve, Fredericks and Parker,
other winners for the Danes
included the Albany 440 relay
team, Amerikaner in loo-yard
dash, Horowitz in the 880-yard
run, Sears in the high jump, and
the mile relay team.

The Danes, although they have
received consistently outstanding
performances from certain
members of the team, are palgued
by a lack of depth which requires
that too many of their members
compete in more than one event
which consequently reduces the
ultimate level of their
performance.

If the mandatory student fee
does go into effect in the fall
semester, 1969, the Central
Council for the year 1969-70 will

'. have to be elected by the entire

student body...

Central Council has now
provided for it‘s election by the

.ontire student body (though

perhaps unconstitutionaily); The
decision, however, as to whether a
non-taxpayer can vote in any
election rests with the Chairman
of the Central Council Standing
Committee
Activity Assessment as provided
in 006869-125. (policy on the
Student Activity) Assessment
passed 9 April 21-2-2; That's

Mandatory student fee - vote YES!

Cont.fiun|npl,cd.3.

[The $8.75 per semester is
separated immediately upon
receipt for a separate account for
Athletic Association. It covers the
needs of the Athletic Association
as requested in a separate
budget.]

Central Council has recently
completed budgeting for 1969-70.
In an attempt to maintain the
integrity of the worthy programs
to which Central Council is
already committed, and to
provide the wide range of
programs and events requested,
Central Council has found it
necessary to budget for about

$225,000. This ﬁgure allows for
virtually N0 emergency spending
NOR for any new groups which
may come into existence in the
coming year. Central Council thus
faces a situation not to its liking;
it can either cut the programs or
raise the assessment. Other means
of obtaining money have been
sought, but little aid is expected
from other means. A mandatory
assessment would alleviate this
dilemmic situation by providing
more money for the programs
without raising the assessment.
Indeed, the assessment could
probably be lowered.

On a politico-thcoretical basis,
it is very unsound fora society to
exist in which members of that
society receive the benefits of
membership, yet they don't
participate in the financial
support of the programs.

More specifically, Central
Council at present has been
granting each student the privilege
of determining whether or not he
would receive benefits from the
payment of the assessment. This is
unsound, however, because
presently all students have the
opportunity to receive many
benefits without even paying the
assessment. For example, the
Albany Student Press and the
University Directory are available
to many students who have not
paid the assessment. WSUA 640 is
availalbe to most on-campus
residents whether or not the

assessment has been paid,

All changes in University policy
effected through Student.
Association and Central Council
are for the benefit of the student
body, not just those students who
have paid the assessment. If
Student Association does not
support the Health and Physical
Education facilities, these may be
used ONLY for clasroom purposes
and not for intercollegiate or

recreational athletics. In other
words, the Physical Education
Center would close at

approximately 2 PM on weekday
afternoons and would not be open
at all on weekends.

Indeed , if the student opts not
to support Student Association by
paying the assessment, he detracts
from the total programming and
deprives others from receiving
benefit of the payment. It is
unfair that some students should
choose not to pay the assessment
and thereby deprive others of the
privileges of payment, while these
same students are receiving
benefits free of charge.

It is true, of course, that not
everyone will take part in all
aspects of the Student Association
programming. Yet, it is very much
unfair for someone to deprive
others of the benefits of
participation, even if he himself

chooses not to participate. And if
students do not support the
moiety from which they receive
benefit, they are not meeting an
obligation which they should feel
toward that society. In New York
State, or in the United States, no

one has the choice of paying or
not paying taxes. It is only when
all members of a society support
the society that the wide range of
benefits may be offered. Each
member may not be able to derive
beneﬁts from the whole range,

but each member is supporting
the total range so that his interests
are represented as well as his
neighbor's interests. It is unfair to
have it any other way.

'Un these bases, the mandatory
assessment is the answer to the
dilemma. The range of
programming could be financed
and the assessment could be
lowered. There would be some
money for emergency spending
and for new interests on campus.
Central Council could then
ﬁnance the range of activities
requested by various organizations
of students without raising the
assessment to the point of being a
great financial burden to the
individual student.

‘ Mandatory   f 

pretty democratic isn't it? One
person decides whether thousands
of students can vote.

0n 24April. bills 6899-138,
139 were passad,(19-1-1 and
19-1-0 respectively). Lots of
opposition again, note. Bill 138 is
the counterpart of 62 and 139 of
61. That is, 138- provides for
withholding grades and transcripts v
of credits (thus no transfers
possible or graduation) if one
refuses to pay student tax. Bill
6869-139 allows exceptions for
hardship cases. Benevolent aren't
we?

Why should one oppose a
mandatory assessment anyway.
The $28.75 you pay per semester
($20 to Student Association and
$8.75 to Athletic Advisory Board)
is dispersed by Central council
(except for AA Board’s $8.75
which is controlled
independently). Who sits on
Council? Council is comprised of
representation of the student
body and of the Commissions and
Pan-Hellenic Council. As chairman
of one Commission I have long
recommended the removal of all
Commissions and councils to
cabinet positions so that Central
Council would be totally elected
by the student body directly. As I
have seen Council function these
vested interest groups play much
too large a legislative role.

As for the students elected by
the student body as a whole, take
a look at the election campaigns.
Pretty informative huh? Lots of
issues. Clear policy ‘ ‘

Ever asked a candidate what
Central Council does, or how it
fits into our governmental

:structul‘e ; have they even been
to any Central Council meetings.
