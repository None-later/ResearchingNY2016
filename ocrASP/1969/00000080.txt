 Addressinganoveflow audience
more than 200 people in the
Assemny Hall, Professor Cecil
lin‘th of, the City University of
New York spoke on "The
Msrranos in Europe" Monday
evening. ..

The retired Oxford scholar
lectured and fielded questions for
nearly an hour and a half. The
lecture was sponsored by the
Departments of Comparative
Literature and Romanpe
languages in recognition of .the
University's program in' Judge

Tile term “Marrano” was used

originally in a deragatory manner
to indicate a lowly, contomptible
person. The "New Christians"
(those Jews who had converted to
Christainity and still had
something of a Jewish
consciousness) soon received this
epithet from their neighbors in
14th and 15th century Spain ant
Portugal.

Professor Roth’s main
proposition was that the
Inquisition in Spain and Portugal
(and later carried to Latin
America) was aimed at these
"New Christians" from Spain.
Many of the Portugese Jews
resued to be “begooned” into
Christianity (Roman Catholicism)
and thus became Marranos as Dr.
Roth pointed out.

Another important point that
many people do not understand,
is the nature of the accusations
brought against the New
Christians by the Spanish
Inquisition. A person would not.
be brought to trial simply for
putting on a clean shirt on
Saturday. but such an act might
be the last link in a series of

accusations (meeting with others
on Saturday for 'the purpose of
praying, sbstainance from pork.
etc.) against the Individual.
Professor. Roth went on to
discuss the torture of Marrsno
prisoners and the omission of the
aut-de-fe (Inquisitional ceremony:

only the weaker Jewish b‘rdtherr

or Ion of property snd wealth.
The result of the persecution
was massive but secret emigration
to other countries in the 18th,
17th and 18th centuries, including
the Turkish Empire (Salonica and

Constantinope), Italy (Ferrar,
Venice) and the Netherlands
(Amsterdam).

by President Collins as a

Several things were obvious.
One was a desire to keep the
‘pressure'on.' so that the impetus
gained as a result of the
Waterman-Rhonda case could be
used to insure permanent student
participation in personnel
procedures in the near future.
Final time is approaching and
anything that doesn't happen
soon will never happen. In spite of
the time pressure the discussion of
personnel procedures and a

Professor Roth was extremely
impressive in his knowledge of the
Marranos and in
communicative skills he used to
convey his points to the audience.

well-attended and well received,

followed.

FRIDAY MAY 2,1969

by Iris Schwartz

Steve Solarz, 25 year old
freshman Assemblyman
(D-Bklyn.) brought his case for
abortion reform to the SUNYA
campus Tuesday .rtiight while
addressing an open meeting of the
University's New Democratic
Coalition. Assemblyman Solarz
spoke on a myriad of topics
ranging from gun control on the
college campus to the New York
State taxation program. The
highlight of the talk centered
around Mr. Solsrz' reasons for
actively supporting the
Blumenthal abortion reform bill
that was once again defeated in
this legislative session.

Assemblyman Solarz called the
debate on abortion reform
“almost a psychedelic
experience," and assailed the
Weak logic that was offered by the
opponition as reasons for voting
against the bill.

Solsrz indicated that many
Assemblymen did not seem to
take into account the variety of
cases where it might be more
moral to abort the fetus than not
to. Mr. Solarz stated sarcastically
that the opposition gave the
impression that passing the reform
bill would make abortion
mandatory, and that certainly is
not the case.

Those in favor of the reform
measures should try to understand
the valid reasons given by those
who are sincerely opposed to the
bill. “They genuinely believe that
abortion is, in bluntest terms,
murder." The crux of the problem
rests with the question "where
does morality lie?" Some say it is
moral to permit abortion while
others say it is moral to prohibit
abortion. Those in favor of reform
say that we must let the morality
of the situation rest with the
individuals involved. Retaining the
present abortion law is “violating
the fundamental notions of
freedom and liberty" inherent in
our society,. Denying the reforms
is imposing a personal conception

On abortion reform ‘

of morality on others.

Repealing the abortion law has
been suggested but the ice must
be cracked with a reform bill at
ﬁrst. For at least another year the
majority of women who need
abortions still will not be legally
eligible to obtain them.

Mr. Solarz addressed himself to
the recent campus disruptions and
stated emphaticallly that he is
against allowing guns on college
campuses, and said that students
should not expect amnesty but
should be willing to take the
consequences of his act. However,
Solarz felt that students shouldn’t
have Regents Scholarships
withheld because of participation
in a campus distrubance.

Assemblyman Solarz spoke
about filling up the loopholes in
the present tax laws and of
increasingthe income tax instead
of the sales tax. Also discussed
was the residency requirement for
welfare recipients, lowering the
voting age, and the problems of a
freshman Assemblyman in
general.

Professor Brand Blanchard feels
that reasonableness may be
termed a “gray virtue." Those
who possess it are not likely to be
dramatic, picturesque or exciting
but they are most likely to be
right.

Speaking to a number of
students, Blanshsrd, a philosopher
and social commentator. defended
his I‘virtue" as something not
flashy or exciting but as
something which he feels is
necessary in today's world. He
defined reasonableness as a
“subtle disposition" to order
thought and practice to the facts

Hartke addresses NDC

Paul O'Dwyer, temporary

New Democratic Coalition,
announced toduy that Senutor

He indicated that the purpose

“We will," Mr. O'Dwyur suid, “be

More importantly, though, we will

of any given situation.

Blsnshard further defined
reasonableness as a temperament
which “sees things not through
rose tinted or black tinted or
distorted or magnified eyes but
sees things as they are."

Blanshard felt that two very
pressing issues, race and Vietnam
would melt away “like snowballs
in the sun" if the people involved
in the issues were reasonable men.

Blunshard noted “we are lovers
of truth but we are also lovers of
much else. Man lives much by
impulses which center around the
sentiment. of self-love. We want to
further whatever supports our
own success of our group's success
while we dislike whatevsr hinders
our self esteem. “The thought of
ourselves is the node uround
which feelings gather."

The professor feels a distrust of
extremists and those who “think
with their blood." Conclusions
which come from passions may
seem rcusonublc but are often
simply "reason mixed with and
discredited by hutred" Speaking
of rovolutionury figures hc stuted
“It might have been better for the
world if the zculots had never
been heard of.” A person should
not be u hero simply because he
hills chungcd the course of history.

Speaking of present duy
Amcricun youth, Blunshurd notes
extremes in states of mind. The
boredom of the well to do und the
hopelessness of the ghetto
“explode into n flabby hippicdom
on one bond and violent
delinquency on the other."

tanks are playthings.

Some art and poetry also
reflects unreasonablcness in that
there is “indifference to content
and indifference to humanity."
The bewildered layman finds it
difficult to distinguish between
art and abnormality.

Blanchard feels that there is
something to be said for impulse
but many artists, for instance
Dostoyevsky, go to “the utterest
extremes" and while a romanticist
would be happy to be mad and a
Dostoyevsky, others would argue
for more reason.
