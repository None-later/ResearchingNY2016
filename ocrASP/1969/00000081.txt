After a discouraging
doubleheader loss to Oneonta, the
Albany State freshman baseball
team has proven that they can
bounce back. Since those two
losses, the fresh have upped their
over all record to three wins and
two losses.

A sloppy opening day victory

losses to Oneonta. In the home

defeating Siena 12-4. He struck
out eight batters and allowed only
five hits, four of them infield
singles. Jim Bradley knocked in
two runs with a single and a

double. Rick Ward singled and
tripled in the game.

Yesterday, in a seven inning

pitched a five hitter in a 5-3
victory. Green walked only one
batter. No errors were
committced. Shortstop Rod

The Freshman Golf team was
downed by Siena on Tuesday to
bring its overall record to 3-2.

Playing at Siena's home course
and being guided by the fact that
the home team sets the rules of
play, the match was determined
by the lower total of the four best
scores on each team. Siena won
by a total of 13 strokes. Low
scorers for State were John Heher
with a fine 84, Dick Schwartz,
Kevin Seymour and Dave Fink.
Albany's total however was not
good enough to match up to the
very fine 77 by Siena's Jackie
Callahan and an 82 by their
number two golfer.

Today, the team will play in a
triangular match against Albany
College of Pharmacy and North
Country Community College at
