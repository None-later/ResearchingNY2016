House in San Francisco and the
Unicorn in Boston.

The reactions to his
performances are varied:

“...this is the first time I have
identified with the idea of a song
and really been made to think. I
especially enjoyed ‘Cocaine’ and
‘Excuse Me for Living.’ "

“The performance was
fantastic - one which deeply
agitated my soul. I felt as though
he and I were communicating. He
made me feel so thankful to be
alivc--really alive-an experience
which seldom occurs."

“Not only was he entertaining,
but thought-provoking. His
personality came through all of
his songs as if he really believed
them. The content of his
performance was really great!"

It is agreed by the majority,
though. that he takes command of
a stage, first by his very presence
(6’) and then in the manner of a
true performer, whose reason for
being there is to touch his
audience.

He will appear May 5-10,
Monday thru Thursday at B and
9:30 PM and Friday and Saturday
at 8, 9:30 and 11 PM.

nellie" Stanley Castleton, an RV
repair man with real feelings and
convictions in a society where
they no longer matter. His
eccentricity in this milieu makes
him a comic person.

the social ritual, are Gary Restifo,
Sherry Bass, Joseph Geoco, Daniel

Tax Catch

To the Editor:

Last semester it was pointed out that
Student Association was a private organization with
membership restricted to those wln- paid the SA
Tux. In a brilliant series of moves this semester, the
Privately elected Iegislutivo body of SA. (Central
Council) legislated itself and S.A. rcprcsr-ntntivc.
The law said, in effect, that... W11, the present
members of S.A. (Council) have dccidcd to make all
full-time undergraduate students members of our
club. On the surface this seems like 11 hig-ln-nrtcd
move. But I assure you, there is 11 catch.

Behind this whole business lies the issue of :1
mandatory tax. Student Association waan to 13er
it mandatory tax down the throat of the student
bOdY so badly that it will even assume the guise of 11
representitiva body in order to do it.

But don't be fooled. Student Association is not :1
mI’l’esantativc body, nor is Central Council. In tl1c
“IBI- pluce, Council 'has legislated that all
non-members of SA. should now become members
without giving these non-members a voice as to
whether they wanted to become members or not
“Nd; since Council was elected only by SA.
members, the bill amounts to dictatorial legislation.
Secondly, only the former S'A members (tuxpnycrs)
are allowed to run in this so called democratic
election. This amounts to an attempt to perpetuate
the dictatorial regime that is shufting all
nun-taxpayers.

Therefore, I would suggest (I) that Student
Association attempt to determine If, indeed, all
full time undergraduates (or even 11 majority) desire
to be represented by S.A., (2) then hold a truly
democratic election allowing all full-time underlii'ﬂd“
to vote and to run for office it“ they desire, and (3)
then; with this representative body, take action on
the question of a mandatory tax. I

Until such an action or a course of uct10n

mumbling It is taken, Student Association cannot

call itself a representative group and, therefore,
should be ignored by all those who do not care for
the dictatorial procedures it has undertaken in the
past few weeks.

Bernie Bourdcau
Constitution compromise

To the Editors:

The proposed revision of the Student Association
Constitution making thc selection of president and
vice-presidan a popular choice is impractical. The
president of Student Association is the chairman of
lentrul Council (our highest body of student
government) and must be able to work in unison
with this group. It seems logical that. the
membership of Central Council would best know
who would be its most effective leader.

It is also true that these officers are the
rcprcscntntivcs of the student body at many affairs.
The right of the student body at large to have some
say in who will represent it at conferences (with
such officials as Governor Rockefeller or Chancellor
Could) is also unquestionable.

The obvious solution to these problems in
choosing presidan 11nd vice-president of SA Is to
hnvc either the Central Council mthc student body
screen candidates while the other makes the final
selection. Whether the Council will give the
alternatives for final selection to the students, or
make the filial sclcction themselves (from a number
of Council members clcctcd in an tit-large election),
makes little differecnc.

In either of them: manners both the students and
their representatives will have significant power In
choosing their leaders. This is more desirable than
completely direct election (proposed) or the present
system which leaves the selection solely in Central
Council's hands. Bum, Kirwhne,

PS. The turnout (5) at. the discussion of these
proposed revisions 'I‘ucsduy seem to reinforce the
convictions of those who believe that the student
body is not ready to handle its own political affairs.
I urge the students of BUNYA ,to get off their asses
and involve themselves In something which Is of
some importance to them.

The rourmnié IN THE centre or the podium were 1...... on
yesterday for a trial run. The blooming trees, carillon wnter tower.
and refreshing water all attempt to add new life to the campus.

Nine schools join
student exchange

The University is among nine
universities and colleges that'will
participate in the second year of
the Domestic Student Exchange
Program, more than doubling the
number of schools involved in the
plan which orginated a year ago.

The four schools which
originally developed the prgram
were Illinois State University, the
University of Alabama at
Tuscaloosa, the University of
Montana at Missoula and the
University of Oregon at Eugene.

Joining the list are the
University of Massachusetts at
Amherst, Montana State

University at Bozoman, Portland
State College, Portland, Ors.,
Paterson State College, Wayne,
N.J., and the State University of
New York-Albany.

Under the prgram a student at
any one of the schools may
choose to spend a year studying at
one of the others at only a
minimal extra cost. The grades
and credits he earns at the host
school are transferred back to his
original school and applied toward
his graduation there.

To be eligible for the exchange
program, a student must be a
sophomore or junior and have a
grade point average of 2.5, or
above average. He pays only the
regular in»state resident fees at the
host school or the regular fees at
his home school, depending upon
the procedures adopted by the
different schools in the program.

The exchange program makes it
possible for students to meet
others with different backgrounds
studying in different types of
educational institutions. It
permits exchange of ideas and
experiences with persons of
different social, cultural and
educational patterns.

The program is the first of its
kind set up among public
undergraduate institutions.

Further information can be
obtained from the Office of the
Dean of University College, Dr.
Robert B. Morris, located in SS
