Last night, the Undergraduate
Academic Council passed the
proposed new academic calendar.
The proposal will come before

on June 2. President Collins has
expressed his belief that it is quite
possible to successfully implement
the modified semester calendar in
September 1969, since new
students can be advised of the
change In calendar during the
summer.

The Task Force on the
Academic Calendar has

trimester system; and (d) the

failing to maintain a “reasonable

Monday by Sen. Norris Cottone,

The New Hampshire
Republican told the Senate “the
federal government is in no
position to take over the
administering of any college or
university and quell disorder and
violence upon its campus."

He added, however, “It does
not follow that the federal

necessary steps to preserVe order.”

Sen. Jacob K. Javits, R-N.Y.,
said in a Senate speech
“Radicalism and violence on our
university campuses now threaten
to bring a wave of ‘bucklash,’
punitive law, repression, and
counter-violence."

Javits said he was convinced
“American universities have the
means to deal with student

universities “have much to do to
reform themselves..."

Sen. George Murphy, R-Colif.,

The Making of the President: 1969

by Daryl Lynne Wager
Staff Reporter
As the semester draws to a close, students look toward the new
school year and the changes it will bring. One of the most dynamic of
these changes will soon be evident, as students, faculty and
administration continue the processof selecting the next president of
the University.

The selection process has been undertaken by a search committee,
established as an offical committee of the University Council.
University Council has the legal responsibility of recommending a
candidate to the Board of Trustees of the State University of New
York. The Council will endorse the candidate suggested by the search
committee, and in all probability the Board of Trustees will conﬁrm
his appointment.

Upon announcing his retirement, President Evan R. Collins met
with the Council to determine the composition of the search
committee. It was decided that the committee would be composed of
three members of University Council, three faculty members and
three students. ' ' ' " ‘

University Council chose as three of its members: Mr. J. Vanderbilt
Straub, chairman of University Council; Mr. M. L. Levi; and Mr.
KennethBuhrmaster.

Dr. J. Ralph Tibbetts, Dr. Walter Knotts and Dr. Alfred Finkelstein
were designated to represent the faculty on the search committee.
They had been selected by the Executive Committee of the Faculty
Senate and then approved by the Senate itself.

The student body was made aware of the availability of the
remaining three positions; interested students submitted applications
for screening by the cabinet of Central Council (the president, vice
president and the Commission chairmen or their designees) and were
then appointed by Central Council. The three students thus selected
are: Duncan Nixon and Jeffrey Mishkin, both undergraduates, and
Kay Hotaling, a graduate student.

The search committee first met on December 6, 1968, and have
since participated on an equal basis, with Mr. Straub presiding as
chairman. At the start of its deliberations, the committee drew up a
list of general criteria, with the understanding that none of these
would be an absolute requirement for a qualified president:

(1) Evidence of distinct r ‘ in J ' ' ‘ " L'_ of
a complex academic institution, constituting vision and potential for
future growth.

(2) Ability to communicate effectively with faculty, students and

ublic.
p (3) Significant experience in a medium- to large-size institution.

(4) Basic scholarly credentials.

(5) Age between 40 and 55.

The only factor that would automatically eliminate a candidate
from consideration is age above 65.

The search committee solicited names of prospective candidates
from a number of sources. Almost 200 names were suggested.
Background biographical data was obtained on each name, and
personal reports were solicited on the candidates who appeared to be
most promising. The committee then narrowed the field to a relatively
small group of candidates on the criteria of personal comments and
recommendations. ,

Outside sources have been influential in the work of the search
committee, providing needed information when called upon; faculty
members have been particularly active in this phase of the selection
process.

The search committee has taken into consideration the fact that
the role of the new President may wall differ from that of his
predecessor in the light of the increasing size and complexity of the
University, coupled with continuing augmentation and expansion of
student participation in decision-making.

Speaking of the structure of the search committee, member Duncan
Nixon said, “It provides for a variety of outlooks on prospective
candidates, and brings together individuals with varied contacts and
sources of information. This is perhaps the most responsive and
representative structure that has yet been established for this
purpose.”

Nixon feels that the small group of candidates still under
consideration are all well-qualified and would each make an excellent
president; however, it is as yet impossible to ascertain when the
committee will complete its work by recommending its choice of
candidate to the University Council, nor has the date on which the
new president will take office been established.
