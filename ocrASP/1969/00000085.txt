The Sixth Street
Improvisational Theatre has been
touring college campuses and was
in the Campus Center this past
Sunday.

They presented a piece entitled.
“Studentlife,” which traces the
history of a student from birth
until the time he overthrows his
university. The point they were
trying to put across was done
clearly, and from here on in, Iwill
only dwell on'their techniques.

As the audience was coming in,
the actors were doing warming up
exercises. To begin the
performance, they sang two songs,
and asked the audience to join in.
They were billed as being a group
that wanted audience
participation. In order to get the
audience to participate, their
objective, from a theatrical
standpoint, should have been to
draw the audience to them. and in

t.

Shows

no instances did they do this.

They made.good use of an
Artaudlan technique of working
in limited/areas while going

through several stages of the boy ‘5
life. They went through a
symbolic portrayal of the episode,
While specifically working within
a small chalked area.

Body movements were well
done, and showed the agility of
much concentration on physical
training.

On the whole, I did not find
the acting well done. I fell that
some of the actors did not have
full control of their actions, which
is essential for this type of
presentation. The lead student did
not take his role seriously. There
were times when what should
have been frustration, was played
for a comic effect.

As a. group giving their
philosophy, the Sixth Street
Theatre does a good job, but as
far as acting and techniques so,
they just don ’t rate. I

University Band gives
annual Spring concert

The University Concert Band
will hold its annual spring concert
on May 13, 1969, at 8:30 in the
Main Theatre of the Performing
Arts Center. There is no admission
and everyone in the university is
invited to attend.

The program will include the
following:

“Chorale and Aleeluia" by
Howard Hanson one of the most
important figures in the American
musical world. He has exerted
widespread influence as a
composer, conductor, and
educamr- “Chorale and
Alleluia" was completed in
January, 1954, and is Dr.
Hanson’s first work for
symphonic band.

“Concerto Grosso" for trumpet
horn, trombone, and band by
Robert Finn will feature as
soloists Dr. James Morris,
trumpet, Dr. Daniel Nimetz, horn,
and Harvey Wescott, trombone.
Mr. Firm is a member of the
composition faculty at the
University of Southern California.
His “Concerto Grosso" is one of
the rare examples in band
literature of the use of the
popular eighteenth century form,
which contrasted a small soloistlc
group with a larger ensemble.

The last piece before
intermission will be an “Original
Suite" for military band by
Gordon Jacobs. This piece
contains three parts, March.
Intermezzo, and Finale.

The University Percussion
Ensemble under the direction of
Mr. Thomas Brown will perform
two pieces. The first will be
"I‘occata," the Third Movement
by Carlos Chavez; the second,

“Afro,” by Mr. Brown.

The band will then play two
selections:

“Colas Breugnon Overture” by
Demitri Kabalevsky. This opera,
translated “The Master of
Clamedy,” was completed in
1937. The premiere was given the
following year at the Leningrad
State Opera. Based on the now-I
by Romain Rolland, the plot is set
in sixteenth century France and
centers about the efforts of Coins
to Merthrow the cruel lord (the
duke) and to free his people from
tryanny.

The final piece on the program
will be the “American Ovcraturc
for Band" by Joseph Wilcox
Jenkins.

“Cercle F rancais ”
accomplishes aims

By Alan Lasker

The State University is a
mammoth structure composed of
buildings, trees, and fountains.
This, however, is only the physical
appearance. What is happening
that is not so visible? Well for one
thing, organizations, clubs, and
groups have been continually
forming to provide activities for
the students. One such group that
is gaining momentum on our
campus is the Cercle Francais.

Cercle Francais is an
organization that is composed of
enthusiastic students that.
accomplish the goals they
themselves set forth. Since their
reorganization in the spring, they
have accomplished an impressive
amount of their aims.Cercle
Francais has provided students
with the opportunity to hear from
the very distinguished Mr.
Strozkowski on French actuality;
to indulge in many French dinners
with true French atmosphere and
to participate in various trips.

The groups meet informally
where they discuss topics related
to French activities and culture.
Their gatherings are often
high-lighted with speakers as well
as refreshments and records. In
the upcoming future theCercle
Francais will sponsor a wine
tasting party (May 8) and the
showing of the famed French
movie “Crim Blane."

The coming year will continue
with this basic format and only
add upon it; already plans are in
the making for certain speakers,
trips to New York to see a play
and a museum, dinners at local as
well as distant French restaurants,
and if more students than the

present become active in‘Cercnle
Francais, a French play will be
performed by the members for
the public.

To become a member of such
an industrious organization as
CercleFrancais is quite simple; a
student tax card and enthusiasm.
That's all.

The idea of ﬁlming a novel page
by page and editing it into a seven
or eight hour spectacular is not
new. Eric von Stroheim’s 1924
screen classic, "Greed," which was
adapted from Frank Norris'
“McTeague,” was originally 40
reels and ten hours long.

He“ von Stroheim had the idea
that the audience would view the
first five hours in the afternoon,
go out to dinner, and then return
for the conclusion. Unfortunately,
Hollywood’s hierarchy viewed von
Stroheim as somewhat of a
crackpot and hired a man with
1/10th his talent to edit "Greed"
into a more “reasonable” length.

The final result was an abridged
l2 reel version which von
Stroheim tried to disavow. Yet
even in that horribly mutilated
version, van Stroheim’s distinct
style can readily be seen.

This leads me to my major
criticism of the latest adaption of
Tolstoy's WAR AND PEACE.
Director Sergi Bondarchuck has
no style. He shoots each scene as a
single entity and hopes he can put
them together. In one scene the
camera will track wildly and then
in another scene which demands
the same pace, the camera’s only
allusion to movement is a mild
pan.

Mr. Bondarchuck also seems to
have a fetish for having people
walk in front of his camera.
Evidently he figures it is a clever

Marjory Fuller, mezzo-soprano
and teacher of voice in the music
department at Albany, will be the
featured performer in concert
Monday, May 12, at 8:30 pm in

Gesellen," Haydn’s “Two
Canzoni," and Benjamin Britten’s
“A Charm of Lullabies." Works
by Mozart, Roussel, Debussy,
Charles Loeffler, Charles Ives, and

Samuel Barber will also be heard.
Mrs. Fuller is a former faculty
member at De Pauw University.
She has performed a broad
repertoire with numerous
symphony orchestras, including
many oratorios.

The next concert at Albany will

be a program by the University
Concert Band on Tuesday, May

way to get out of a shot. it is
clever only when not overused.
(During the ballroom scene, every
second and a half all we see is the
back of somebody's coat.)

Bondarchuck tries to’ be
inventive and sometimes he
succeeds admirably; Instead of
throwing the camera out of focus
to show the vision problems of his
dying characters, he drops water
onto the lens and creates a more
realistic effect.

Another successful device,
successful because he doesn't over
use it, is his symbolic entering
into character’s minds. The lyric
“green pastures" sequence, which
Andre experiences as he faces
death at the hands of a French
cannonball, is great except for
being a little too long. Mr.
Bondarchuck made this sequence
long enough to fit his background
music: he should have made the
ballad short enough to fit the
sequence.

Director Bondarchuck, as I
said, tries to be inventive. He is
successful sometimes, but misses
more often than not. His blipping
lights and use of colored celluloid
in front of the camera adds
nothing but annoying confusion.

His use of black and white is

for the most part unimaginative.
His attempts at hand holding the
camera are dreadful. He hand-held
during battle and mob scenes to
create a sense of confusion. He
exaggerates the effect so much
that the audience is more aware of
the camera jumping all over the
place than the confusion of the
sequence.
His portrayal of the bumbling,
unclever Pierre is almost
unbelievable. It ranks with the
finest performances of all times.
So fine an actor is Bondarchuck
that he seems to bring the other
characters up to his level when
they appear with him.

By Michael 

That is not to say the other
acting is not good. Andre, Natasa
and all the others are brought to
life in the Tolstoyian manner but

' Pierre is greater than life.

The purposepof this film is to
catch the essence‘and quality of
Tolstoy’s novel. Actually,
although it follows the novel quite
closely, it misses on some most
important points,

Tolstoy not only depicted the
horrors of war, but poked fun at
man’s folly, and especially
Napoleon. The Napoleon
sarcasm is completely left out of
the movie probably because it is
visually much easier to film blood
and gore than build a satirical .
sequence. There are also some
times when Tolstoy is completely
disregarded in favor of out and
out propaganda. The ending is
very weak because of this. General
Kuzatov gives a stirring speech to
his troops, all about showing
mercy to their French prisoners
because they are men just like
them. Its a wonderful speech, but
Tolstoy never wrote anything like
it.

All in all, there are many good
sequences in the Russian version
of WAR AND PEACE. (In a seven
hour film there should be.) If
you’ve nothing better to do for
seven hours by all means go and
see it. But do not go out of your
way to make the time. You can
see the American version in three
hours and get almost as much
Tolstoy with a good deal more
style.
