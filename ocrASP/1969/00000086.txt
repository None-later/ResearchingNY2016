The Albany State Varsity
Tennis Team boosted its record to
5-0 with around, 8-1 victory o'er
Stony Brook this past weekend.
With half the schedule remaining,
Albany looks a fair bet to remain
undefeated.-

Leading the squad is number'

one slnglerman, Ron McDermott,
a lanky senior who sports a 5-0
mark thus far. Right behind him is
junior Dave (the Rave) Hawley.
Dave also boasts a perfect record
of 5-0 to date. Together, the two
have had a little trouble in
doubles play, as they’ve won two
and lost two.

Numbers three and four are
sophomores Ken Finkman and
Ted Rosenberg, who look to give
State solid tennis power for three
big years. Finkman has lost only
one and won four, while
doubles-partner Rosenberg still
rides undefeated with five wins
and no losses. Together, they

team which is presently 3-1.

Ross Pusatere (3-2), and Norm

Many observers feel that this

front six is the ﬁnest Albany has
ever put together, and 'they may

' be right.

next year, had been undefeated in the; the ends“ Play“-

twelve previous games.

The score, a heartbreaking 8-7,
only begins to tell the story.
Army, big and tough, gave
Albany's stickmen their worst
physical heating to date.

After West Point had taken a
first period lead from the Danes
on excellent passing and solid
defense, Albany's Steve Jakway
was hurt while scoring his
twenty-fourth goal of the season.

Jakway was taken to the
hospital and did not return to the
game. Injuries seemed to be the
order of the day as numerous
Albany men limped to the
sidelines only to return, bandaged
and swollen, to take and inﬂict
more physical punishment.

Outstanding in the losing effort
for State were goalie Bob Cole
and defenseman Dave Riegel. Cole
made-twenty-two saves, including

he entire game was a
frustration of State's inability to
get the ball to their attackmen.
That attack was largely
responsible for most of the
seventy-seven goals scored prior to
Saturday’s tussle.

The lacrossemen will try to
resume their winning ways
tomorrow when they meet a well
established Hartwick varsity in a
home contest.

Third Doubleheader Loss

Doubleheaders seem to be the
big headache for the Albany State
Varsity baseball team this season.
The twin losses to Lemoyne
College on Saturday evened our
record at six wins and six losses.

Previously, the Danes have won
six single games and have
doubleheader losses to Oswego
and Central Connecticut. The
Lemoyne games were especially
heart breaking since they were
both one run losses. Dave Wheeler
pitched the entire seven inning
first game in a 5-4 loss. The Danes
were ahead 4-3, but a two run
homer by Lemoyne’s catcher in
the sixth inning, accounted for
the final score. In that game,

rightfielder Rich Spiers homered
for the Danes.

First baseman Jack Sinnott
knocked in a run in each game.
He's hitting .290. Catcher Jim
Sandy, at .310, is the leading
hitter. Pitcher Rich Bardeschewski
has two triples and is hitting .500.

Albany’s number one pitcher
George Webb, pitched the entire
second game. The Danes were
down 7-2, but George Margan
pinch hit a two run homer in the
ﬁfth, making it 7-4. In the sixth,
Bardeschewski knocked in two
runs, to make the score 7-6, the
ﬁnal.

AMIA Playoffs Begin

George Rolling finishing fourth.
In the two-mile, Rolling finished

Communications continued to page 7
Protest at ,gglbany?

To the Editors:

Noticing in the TIMES a few days ago a list of
various protest developments in the universities
scattered across the country, I noted a neighbor,
Cornell (and recently RPI and Colgate) and
ludicrously wondered if Albany would ever have
any type of protest which would make news on the
front page of the TIMES. After dousing my face
with water to regain my momentarily disintegrated
sobriety, I compromised that an inch on the
ﬁnancial page would indeed be more than hope
could wildly desire.

Ah, but one can argue that our march on the
capitol made the papers—although if you dig deeper
the march conducted without CUNY was a flop
(due to lack of participation)—or worse, a mock.
But what I'm really trying to get at is not the
bourgeois importance of making headlines; that‘s
merely a symbol—for those that care enough to get
out and cut a class (or a week of them) in support
of what they feel needs to be changed—the thing
that’s so important about Albany is that people
really don't care about anything. When I first came
here I thought perhaps it was the freshmen who
were just disjointed, therefore not able to be
concerned; but its not merely freshmen who are
stagnating here in our slime—everyone is
succumbing to this blatent complacency of a middle
class pot-bellied businessman pushing away from his
table and belching softly...

But what really frustrates—even more terrifies me
is the reply that will be given to the charge of
apathy and complacency:

SO WHAT?

Sincerely,

Rae Ann Harman

Dog Power

To the Editors:

As a self-respecting member of the Dog
Community, I feel I must respond at once to the
vicious and unprovoked smear against me by one
Ronald Simmons. His insinuations that I am a
"monster," am "dirty," and that I am likely to bite
someone or deposit my excrement on the kitchen
floor are totally unfounded.

He calls me dirty, and yet he puts a four-letter
word into a public letter with his name attached. At

The Department of

couldn't control his vulgarity, "crap."

It is because of smears such as this that it
becomes obvious that a new movement must be
formed: Dog Power. That is why I am advocating
the formation of the University Dog Alliance.

We plan to submit the following demands to
President Collins:

1) Free access to all university garbage bins; 2) A
department of Canine Studies, to be taught by Rin
Tin Tin, Lassie, and the Littlest Hobo (visiting
professor); and 3) An increase in the number of
trees, hydrants, and signposts around campus. If
these demands are not met, we plan to conduct a
massive scratch-in in Pres. Collins’ office.

Power to the Dogs!

Sincerely,

Sailor

We, the undersigned, strongly disagree with
Ronald Simmons’s letter in the May 2 ASP. From
our long association with Sailor, after sharing many
lunches with him, we can testify that he is neither
an “ugly monster," nor a “dirty animal." He is
good-natured and house broken, so Mr. Simmons‘
fears are completely unfounded. In fact, his
departure would mean a great loss to the snack bar.
However, if Mr. Simmons, with his or elses, could be
kept off the campus...

COUNCIL HAS ENOUGH HOT AIR AS IT IS..§ but sometimes.
smokesignals are probably the best way to communicate.

They walk in beauty...

All of us have creative instants, and our system
and surroundings tend to squash them. Sidewalk
chalking is the art form which allows everyone the
opportunity to create.

Several points can be made in favor of the
exercise of this noble art. The first of these has
already been stated; it is a basic expression of
creativity.

Can’t one be creative by writing on walls you
ask? Yes and no. When one writes on walls, he may
indeed produce an artistic triumph. Unfortunately
the nature of our in roundings is such that the walls
should be kept clean. Chalkings on the walls means
work for the overworked custodial staff.

If, instead, one uses the sidewalk as his canvas, he
solves this problem. The action of walking feet and
the rains serves to erase the art work. This allows for
a frequent reuse of any space. On the negative side,
it allows the mean and nasties to scuff up and
eradicate one's work.

Hopefully, this will keep them busy enough that
they won't be having time to perpetrate more
virulent forms of badness on us.

In supporting this grand art, I ask only that
beauty be placed on the sidewalks. The security
police have already stopped me once, but as long as
the chalking remains exemplary, they have no
complaint. If there is no grossness, there can be no
defacing through this transitory form of beauty.

Should any of you choose to join in the exercise
of this noble art, I have two suggestions to make.
First, buy regular coloured chalks-they are
scuffable and water soluable. Second, they may be
bought in the Toy Shop and Woolworth’s at
StuyVesant Plaza.
