Guns was the rule at the
organizational meeting last
Thursday night of the Hebrew
Students Alliance, as 150

outspoken students rtfemptcd to
answer, each in his cwn way, the
quation, “If 1 am not for myself,
than who is?" (Hillel).

MJ. Rosenberg, initiator of
what he termed the “Jewish
militant organization," tried
untuccessfully n maintain order
but was impeded by the fact that
parliamentary procedure could
not be.  lamented effectively
in a not-yet-existant organization.

Rosenberg opend the meeting
with a discussion of Israel’s
present precarious position and
the danger of U.S. increasing
“neutrality” toward the
Arabvlsraeli conflict. Then he
initiated the series of accusations
and counter-accusations that were
to color the entire evening.

Prime targets under attack were

“faculty members on this campus
who are antirsdmitic," the YEA,
SDS and the Socialist Workers
Party. Rosenberg decried what he
called “the Nazi kind of line right
here in the student center at
Albany State." However, it whs
stressed that insofar as the
meeting was to be for the purpose
of organization, ‘Ieverything is
tentative" with respect to the
name and platform of the group.

Rosenberg, anticipating
criticism from those who saw the
meeting as an act of retaliation,
announced early in the evening
that the Hebrew Students Alliance
is “not an arm of the Black
Student Alliance; not an arm of
Hillel either." He stated that he
sought as members Jews and
non-Jewish sympathizers to
s u pport Israel, Biafra,
Czechoslovakia and other liberal
causes.

Dr. Bernard Johnpoll of the
Department of Political Science,
delivered an emotion-packed
speech in which he proclaimed:
"You have been lied to and

betrayed and misinformed by
everyone here, and it is time that
you know (it). We have hadit. We
are men. When we go to
Auschwitz this time, (they’ll) go
with us!"

Johnpoll explained as the
reasons for his vehement attack
on the administration his
longstanding desire to teach
Jewish history without pay, and
the administration’s refusal to
allow him to do so. “By this
speech I am putting my tenure on
the line," he said, “and I am ready
to do so."

thnpoll stirred up
considerable anger with an
accusation that "Arab students
are molly-coddlcd" and that
“faculty rrembers are asked to go
easy on Arab students.

"We don’t object to the Black
Studies Program,“ he continued.
and on this principle was wildly
and unanimously applauded. “It's
also time that the Jews knew that
much of the greatness of our

AN ASP FATURE
by Kevin McGin'

This article is supposed to be
about Student Advisory Boards,
‘or the participation of the student
body in the Academic o ration
of the University. The ant usiaam
for student participation by both
the faculty members and the
students seems to be rather
minimal. A quick sampling of a
number of students will find that
very few are aware of any student
representation in their respective
departments.

The nature and magnitude of
student participation varies with
each department. In many of the
departments each of the various
committees has only one or two
students, while in the Math Dept.,
student membership is as much as
50% on each of the committees.

Some departments have a body
of students who have been elected
by the majors and are able to
recommend changes in the
department. Other departments
such as the Biology Department,
allow students who belong to the
respective department club to
suggest curriculum change.

The effect of this token
participation seems to be minimal.
First of all, student representation
in most of the departments is
minor in comparison to the
faculty’s. Secondly, some
departments appoint rather than
allow representatives to be
elected. Thirdly, the purpose of

these student representatives rs
only advisory.

Once a policy is recommended
by a particular committee it must
be passed by the tenured faculty
in the respective department.
From there it goes to a College or
University-wide committee for
approval and finally to the
President.

Although there is student
representation on the
University-wide committees there
are sure to be frustrations, with
the minority of student
representation and the many
channels that must be passed

before recommendations take
effect.
Both Faculty and

Administration are eager to have
students represented on the
various committees, but to the
extent that they will be allowed
to have “power of change” is left
for speculation. Many of the older
faculty members are not very
willing to give up the power to
which they have become
accustomed.

Organizing students to achieve
such demands seems to be equally
as difficult. One Psychology major
has had difficulty attaining a list
of the Psychology mayors. Only
when she suggested that the
names were available at the
Registrar did she receive them.

She also reported that getting
the students interested in such
activity is almost futile.

tickets. This is the reason there
was such a lengthy wait to enter
the gym.

The 40 students with forged
tickets were eventually admitted
when it became apparent that
there was not an extremely large
number of people with
counterfeit tickets.

The counterfeit tickets were
thinner and slightly lighter in
color than the genuine tickets.
They all were number 1503. It has
not been determined yet who was
involved in the counterfeiting. A
report has been filed with the
Campus Security.

There are plans for a different
method such as a more

the future to insure that there is
not a recurrence.

There have been numerous
instances in history which have

‘shown that the transfer of power

comes by the will of those who
want it and less so by those who
already have It. The question is:
how many students are willing to
take what can be learned and how

‘many only want to learn what is

offered?

Many students, feel that they
are not qualified to make
decisions about their own

- Education. A few professors have

commented that the students are
so used to being led that they
have no desire for self-education.
Dr. Paul Meadows, Chairman of
the Sociology Dept, has a number
of times encouraged students to
organize and present
recommendations for curriculum
change. He has gone as far as
saying that any recommendations
would most probably be adopted,
but student reaction has been
indiffenCe. '

N.Y. Senate bill

by Barry Kirs'chner
Staff Reporter

Central Council has passed a
resolution condemning the
passage of a bill by the New York
State Senate which would deny
state aid to certain student law
breakers. The resolution,
introduced by James Kuhn, was
passed at CC's meeting last
Thursday.

Kahn urged the passage of the
measure because the Senate’s bill
discriminates against the poor. He
justified this by saying that the
wealthy student would be more
free to act with ‘ucademic
freedom' since he does not have as
great a financial need for state aid.

The issue of academic freedom
was brought up in Central
Council’s debate of the resolution.
The disagreement with the
punitive intent of the Senate’s bill
was also a factor behind the
Council‘s condemnation.

Part of the Senate’s bill says
that no student shall be eligible to
receive benefits “who has been
convicted, without subsequent
pardon, . . . of any felony or of
the misdemeanor of criminal
trespass in the first or second
degree, unlawful assembly,
aggravated harrasmcnt, criminal

Rockefeller veto it.
