Screaming wlth Hell’s fire, gulping Southern Comfort and grooving
to the beat, Miss Janis Joplin, a female leadbelly, a Texan in and out
of four colleges, a one-time ' " ' v , ‘ ‘ ‘ " the l' ' ','s
capacity-filled gym last Friday night.

Janis Joplin was taken in by “Big Brother and the Holding Co." a
few years back. One week after the release of her first record single
she began firing the rest of her group. Janis Joplin decided to send
“Big Brother and the Holding Co." back to San Francisco while she
shopped for a band that could move with her, rather than stiﬂe her.

"Summertime" and “Take a Piece of my Heart” demonstrate Janis‘
voice. Her voice cuts like a razor blade, but one can still hear a sort of

r' . forth. “ ‘ ,, drinking, clapping and
dancing-Janis does them all. She feels and acts in the manner that she
wishes on stage. She’s free.

Janis’ versatile group, consisting of Roy Markowitz, Sam H.
Andrew III, Terry Clements, Terry Hensley, Richard Kermode, and
Keith Kcherry, back Janis well. Their instrumental arrangements are
executed with precision. Flute, trumpet, drums, guitar,
tamborine...they all harmonize together to produce just what one

 

would expect; A Janis Joplin and
    Co. The beat didn't rumble, and
the notes didn't fly haphazardly.
The group had no trouble in
commanding the attention of the
audience.

The audience lovcd her...even
though she did not sing “Ball and
Chain" as one devoted follower
had requested her to do. ButJanis
was kind cnought to apologize
and say, "I'm sorry...l forgot."

Janis generated life in her
audience...if there had been more
room, people would have left
their seats to move with her. The
audience was satisfied with Miss
Joplin...the back up music was
good, the atmosphnrc was great
but most of all because Janis
Joplin was himself.

Janis Joplin performs with a
distinct style. “or voice is one
which is most distinguished; her
actions contain an air of freedom.
The audience knew what to
expect and were not disappointed.

Along with Janis Joplin and Cu.
"Earth Opera” appeared. 'I‘hoy
failed to generate the feeling that
Janis had; they exploded with a
band. but not enough l'lre. Many
times their instruments drowned
out their lead singer and many of
their selections seemed to contain
a similar beat. liowuvor one
selection that was handled
differently was their anti-war
chant. For the most part‘
instrumentally they created the
agony, battle cries and the pain of
war.

Polish Student Alliance, Queers

Albany State readers are,fed up
with the above ground
underground ASP's constant

,attention to' these organizations.

Don’t get us wrong. We’re all for
debate and discussion, but we feel
that the “constructive power" on
this campus, which is backed
almost solely by Greek
organizations, has been left by the
wayside in the ASP's descent into
mediocrity. The authors of this
column hope to bring to light
where the true power on this
campus lies-GREEK POWER'
Y.A.F., when was the last time
you sponsored a blood drive?
Alpha Pi Alpha has sponsored
several drivas. S.D.S., when was
your last clothing drive for the
needy? Kappa Beta had one this
fall. Y.S.A., when was the last
time you gave any extra time to
play and teach basketball with

underprivileged children? Alpha‘
Lambda Chi and Potter Club have
done it several times. We can do
on and on about the positive
activities of the Greeks, and upon
request, WE WILL.

In anticipation of the criticism
that this column will probably
bring, we aren't trying to claim
that Greek life is perfect. Sadly
enough, fraternities but up bars
once in a while, but on the whole
GREEK POWER. is constructive.

With the I.F.C. Smoker only a
few days away and sorority rush
already in full swing, all
independent students should
consider their futures at Albany
State. If you're a guy, attend the
Smoker this Friday night,

hallucinations.

We have praised the Greeks as a
constructive force in . our first
column. We will also provide
constructive criticism whenever
needed. We, the authors, are going
out on a limb in stating what we
believe to be the truth. We
challenge the Greek organizations

Guarneri String Quartet

to perform at

Friday night, Feb. 21, Music
Council will present at 8:30 in
Page Hall, The Guarneri String
Quartet. The Quartet, originally
formed at Vermont’s Marlboro
Festival, consists of four young
string players: Arnold Steinhardt
and John Bailey, violins; Michael
Tree, viola; and David Soyer,
cello.

Following the Quartet's New
York debut at Manhattan’s New
School for Social Research in
February, 1965, the “Guaneris”
were quartet-in-residence at

Page Hall

Harpur College in Binghamton,
New York.

The concerts created an
opportunity for building an active
reprctory—which is not a
specialized one, but emphasizes
lesser-known works of established
composers.

Tickets will be available all this
week at the Campus Center
Information Desk. The price is $3
for non-students, free for students
with Student ’I‘ax (SUNYA), and
$1 for all other students. Tickets
may also be purchased at the
door.

that the Jewish students on
campus should be as aggressive as
their Black and Arab
counterparts. “We all live
together-this is what the idea of
pluralism is, isn't it?”

The ensuing battle of semantics
caused impatience among the
audience, and a long argument
over priorities of the
organization's name and purpose
obstructed progress. It was finally
agreed that the organization be
named Am Yisrael, which in
English translation means “the
people of Israel."

The selection of a name
afforded little unity to the group,
who were unable to agree upon
the objectives of the new
organization. While many felt that
their primary goal should be to
help Israel, others felt it more
essential to petition for a

HOME INFORMATION

last Sunday at 8 pair. ’ V.
’ Y S A . auppor’t'l' any
organization'- freedom of thought
and speech; therefore, it supports
the formation of all ethnic
alliances on campus.

YSA does not support the state
of Israel basically because it
cannot justify Israel as the answer
to the Jews' problem , of
anti-Semitism. The Israeli
Zionists, says the YSA, are on a
suicidal course, ‘

The Zionists drive Arabs from
their country and commit acts of
agression against Arab countries,
thereby alienating as many Arabs
as possible.

No existing Middle Eastem
regime, including Arab regimes,
are supported by the YSA. YSA in
sympathetic, however, with
revolutions against both the state
of Israel and Arab countries; but
the revolutions must be socialist
revolutions, not simply
revolutions for independence.

Al Fatah, a revolution aimed at
the downfall of both the Zionists
and the Arab regimes, is cited by
the YSA as one Middle Eastern
revolution that is worth fighting.

The Dow Chemical recruiters,
who will be on campus Thursday,
February 20, will again be faced
with a student demonstration.
YS A has advocated a
demonstration, with appointed
leaders to prevent a repetition of
last year's chaos.
