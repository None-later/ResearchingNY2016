The Great Danes' winning
streak was stopped at eleven this
past weekend as an aroused Siena
squad came back from a two
point deﬁcit at half time to record
a 73-64 victory. ,

Rich Margison once again
played an outstanding game as he
hit long jump shots in the first
half to keep the Danes in the lead.
In the second half. the Indians
prevented Margison from shooting
and thus stifled Albany's most
potent weapon. Margison finished
the game with twenty-three
points, ﬁfteen of which came in
the first half.

Scott Price, who was at a
‘distinct disadvantage in having to
guard and being guarded by
Siena's 6-7 Herman, contributed
eighteen points. Jack Jordan who
fouled out of the game, was third
for Albany with eleven markers.

The Danes were hurt in the
second half by excess fouls as
Siena capitalized by hitting
repeatedly.

The standing-room-only crowd
was treated to an exciting first
half as the lead changed hands a
number of times before Siena

Seth Seahly. Bob Kind. and Craig

the Quadrangular meet.

The big problem on the squad,
however, has been experience.
Few Albany matmen have more
than one or two years of wrestling
experience. Craig Springer. with 8
years of wrestling to his credit, is
the most experienced of all the
members.

The team also suffers from a
lack of depth. as it has but one

Once again the Danes were hurt
by their lack of depth as both
Caverly and Jordan got into foul
trouble early in the game and
were force to spend a
amount of time on the bench in
the second half. With these two
starters on the bench the Danes
were badly in need of defensive

The Indians, who were defeated
by State earlier in the Capital City
Tournament, played an inspired
game and quite possibly prevented
the Great Danes chance for a bid.

The Danes record now stands at.
thirteen wins and four losses. This
Saturday, they go against
Southern Connecticut in an
important game; Friday they will
host Potsdam State.

With Rich Margison socring at a
twenty-one point pace, and with
the tough defensive game of Price
and Caverly, the Danes may still
be able to gain a bid to the NCAA
tournament and a possibility to go
on from there.

Council lowers student fee;

SA Legal Aid Society poll 

by Nancy Ourlah,
Staff Reporter

The passage of the bill
containing revised student activity
assessment rates was the highlight
of last night’s Central _Council
meeting.

This bill, whose major provision
calls for a reduction of $4 in the
mandatory student tax rate for
the entire year. contains changes
affecting all students, including
graduate and special students as
well as students enrolled in the
General Studies program.

The new rate of $26.75 per
semester applies to all
undergraduates and special
students carrying 9 or more credit
hours a semester. Those carrying 4
to 8 credit hours will pay $l3.38
per semester. and those having a
course-load of less than 4 hours
are exempt from paying student
tax.

On the graduate level. if
students elect to pay the student
tax fee the charge will be $113.38
per year for a course load of 7-"
hours and $26.75 per year for [2
or more hours.

Students enrolled in the
General Studies Program will pay
no student tux. These students are
gunernlly people from the

community who take one or twu
courses a your at the University.

A completely new rate for
married students was also
instituted with the bill's passage.
if one member of Student
Association is married to another
member of SA, they will pay the
normal rate for two people but
will receive a refund of $13.38 per
semester. in addition, If an SA
member is married to n
non-member. the non-member
will receive all of the benefits of
student tax by paying $6.69 in
addition to the member'a fee of
$26.75 per semester. Howwer,

not attending the University, he

In other matters, Council
passed the resolution to run an
opinion poll concerning the
establishment of a Student
Association Legal Aid Society.
The poll is expected to be taken
in the fall by Council’s Political
and Social Positions Committee.

The main purpose of the legal
aid society would be to help
obtain legal counsel for University
students charged with a felony or
misdemeanor.

Dennis Arnold. a student at the
University of Buffalo, spoke to
the members of Council about the
Legal Aid System recently
established at U8. and its success
so far.

Arnold stated that the system
consisted of an answering service
that could be called at anytime,
and which gave information to
students about their legal rights. if
the student found himself in jail.

Sum llnlpdrslty 4 No. v... at Albany

by Anita Thayor

Dr. Waterman’s and Mrs.
Rhoads’ term appointments have
been extended for one year by a
decision of President Collins
which concludes with his recent
statement on “Student
Participation," distributed at an
all-University meeting Thursday.
May 8. This is the culmination of
administration efforts to find a
constructive and acceptable
solution to the Waterman-Rhoads
issue.

The issue, according to Collins
“is the extent to which
information from students was
systematically included in the
judgements made, the ways in
which students were involved in
the discussions, and most
important the degree to which
constructive dialogue between the
students and faculty was
effective."

The Student committee
requested Collin's intervention on
the basis of “their inability, over a
period of more than three weeks
to develop a basis for constructive
discussion with the faculty of the
psychology department."

 
  

Prior to this case. the faculty

The Faculty-Senate discussed
the Waterman-Rhonda issue and
President Collin's statement on

student participation at their
Monday meeting.
Although Collins affirmed

several times that attempts had
been made to solve the issue at
the departmental level. many
Senators saw the President’s
action as a threat to departmental
autonomy.

Collins denied that "coercion
had played a role in his decision in
response to another Senator’s
charge.

President Collins emphasized
that the role of “meaningful
student dialogue" was more
important in his review of the
issue than the merits of the
original decisions, on which he
passed no judgement.

The right of students to
petition for the redress of
grievances has been affirmed in a
policy on student consultation
adopted by the Faculty Senate.
Faculty are obligated to “consider
such petitions in good faith and
act responsibly on their merits."

This policy calls for the
University President to impose on
all departments and schools the
"duty of providing for an orderly,
continuing process of
fucultystudent consultation with
regard to policies and decisions on
matters of concern to students."

An Ad Hoc Consultation
Guideline Committee of four
faculty members and four
students will draw up guidelines
for implementation of this policy
before the end of September.
1969.

Any student who is interested
in serving on this faculty-student
committee and will be here this
summer should contact Terry
Mathias in CC 367.
