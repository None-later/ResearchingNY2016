Chapel House destruction.

is opposed

byVIleslelvu

Opposition to the destruction
of Chapel House, which is to be
replaced by an Interfaith Center
has been voiced by the Committee
to Save Chapel House.

The Interfaith Corporation now
owns the property where Chapel
House is located. Although it is
used by University students,
Chapel House is neither run nor
paid for by the University.

This Corporation, made up of
citizens in the community, was
given the power to plan the
Interfaith Center by the Capital
Area Council of Churches. In
order to get the money to build
the Center, it is hoped that enough
donations will be made by
members of the community.

A survey of students in
religious organizations was taken
by the Corporation and it was
revealed that they would be in
favor of the new center.

The preliminary plans for the
center have already been drawn.
The chairman of the Corporation
said that proof of much student
support would be necessary in
order to save Chapel House
because it would be expensive to
change the plans.

One alternative suggested was
that Chapel House be moved.
Within the committee, however,
an objection was made to this--the
architect wouldn't approve of the
way the huge, modern, center

would look next to the old,
wooden house.
Other suggestions include

making the Interfaith Center
smaller or putting it next to the
Chapel House so that it need not
be moved.

Chairman of the Committee to
Save Chapel House. Shari Long,
said that the Interfaith Center
could be a good thing, but that it
doesn't seem to merit the tearing
down of Chapel House. This is
because there doesn't seem to be
any real need for an Interfaith
Center, and especially one of the
size planned.

it would have two floors and
include offices for the campus
ministers and priests, and also one
room large enough to hold 300
people

One of its purposes would be
having traveling clergyman come
and stay for a few weeks while

giving speeches, etc. Any religious
group could meet there. It is
hoped that it would get the
community and the student body
more involved in this type of
activity and also that the religious
groups would become more
active. A regular worship service
would be held every week.
Chapel House was built
somewhere around 1910 and, as a
point of interest, was run by the
Republican machine. Most people
that know the place have come to
love it. Its wooden structure. high

Walinsky,

by committee

ceilings, and fireplaces
contribute to the
atmosphere. It's ideal for small
group discussions and is also a
good retreat house. Its setting on
the hill and the sharp contrast in

atmosphere between the rest of
the campus and Chapel House are
important to those who go there.

Work on the Interfaith Center

is planned to begin next fall. At
the present, the
Corporation is trying to see if the
community is going to donate
enough money.

Initiates Memorial Lectures

A lecture series honoring the ‘

late Senator Robert F. Kennedy
has been established at the
Graduate School of Public Affiars
at the State University of New
York at Albany. The initial
lecture will be delivered by Adam
Walinsky, the late Senator
Kennedy's chief
assistant, on Tuesday, May 20th,
at 8:00 pm at the Campus Center
of the University.

Mr. Walinsky will speak on
“The Radical in Politics." The
lecture series is being sponsored
by the Albany Chapter of Pi
Sigma Alpha, a national political
science honor fraternity.

The Robert F. Kennedy
Memorial Lectures, in addition to
the primary purpose of honoring
the late Senator, will be designed
to establish a dialogue between
today's political leadersugo-
vernment officials and aides-and
tomorrow's political leaders--the
students.

Senator Kennedy was involved
in such a dialogue during his
public life. His many campus
appearances were consistently
marked by a sharp exchange of
opinions and ideas. Senator
Kennedy‘s willingness to accept
this challenge of student views
impressed many of the present
college generation and sparked
admiration for his frankness and
the idealism of his concern.

Mr. Walinsky is a graduate of
Yale University. He joined
Senator Kennedy's staff while

only 26 years old, after having
worked with the Peace Corps. Mr.
Walinsky drafted many of Senator
Kennedy’s best known speeches,
drew up much of the Kennedy
legislative
influential in urging the Senator
to enter the 1968 Presidential
legislative "Me. As

program, and was

Senator Kennedy ’s

“radical in residence," he is well
equipped to address the lecture
topic.

The public is invited to attend

the lecture. All who are interested
in the present campus unrest and
the Kennedy’ New York years
should find the talk worthwhile

    
  

 

  

 

 

A large part of the course will
consist of listening to tapes of
speeches in the listening lab in the
Humanities building. During the
summer, the head of the Rhetoric
and Public Address Department
will-be collecting tapes of black
speakers, and by the fall, the
school will possess a large
collection.

Blood drive
sets record

Red Cross Chapter 4627461 of
Albany with the aid and assistance
of the brothers of Alpha Pi Alpha
Fraternity set an Albany area
blood drive record this past
Tuesday, May 13, 1969. Doors
opened to willing participants at
10:00_ AM. and finally shut six
hours later, but not before 458
life-saving pints of blood were
collected from a non-apathetic
and spirited 501 willing donors.
Mrs. Phillips, an official Red Cross
nurse, said that this was one of
the best turnouts she has ever
witnessed. Her expectancy was
that somewhere in the
neighborhood of 300 pints would
be obtained even though the
fraternity's goal was boldly stated
at 400. Yet, the last drops of
blood shed pushed the mark well
over both the estimation and the
goal. Mr. Peter Pavone, a junior at
State, and Mr. Robert Moses, a
senior, worked throughout the
entire day and put on an
outstanding performance in
attracting many more donors.

The Red Cross and Brothers of
the Alpha Pi Alpha Fraternity
extend their sincere and warm
thanks to all those who
concernedly gave their share to
such a worthwhile drive.
