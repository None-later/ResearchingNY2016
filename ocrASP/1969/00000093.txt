end in a tie. Thus, a repeat
performance of last year's game is
impossible. There will be a winner
(and a loser).

Contact lenses can be
heaven . . . or hell. They
may be a wonder of
modern science but just
the slightest bit of dirt
under the lens can make
them unbearable. In
order to keep your con-
tact lenses as comforta-
ble and convenient as
they were designed to be,
you have to take care of
them.

Until now you needed
two or more separate
solutions to properly pre-
pare and maintain your
contacts. You would
think that caring for con-
tacts should be as con—
venient as wearing them.
It can be with Lensine.

Lensine is the one lens
solution for complete
contact lens care. Just a
drop or two, before you
insert your iens,coats and
lubricates it allowing the
lens to ﬂoat more freely

 

 

in the eye's fluids. That's

 

contact lenses lead
a. clean life?

because Lensine is an
"isotonic" solution,
which means that it
blends with the natural
fluids of the eye.

Cleaning your contacts
with Lensine retards the
buildup of foreign de-
posits on the lenses. And
soaking your contacts in
Lensine between wear-
ing periods assures you
of proper lens hygiene.
You get a free soaking
case on the bottom of
every bottle of Lensine.

It has been demonstrated
that improper storage be -
tween wearings may
result in the growth of
bacteria on the lenses.
This is a sure cause of
eye irritation and in some
cases can endanger your
vision. Bacteria cannot
grow in Lensine which is
sterile, self-sanitizing,
and antiseptic.

Let your contacts be the
convenience they were
meant to be. Get some
Lensine, from the Murine
Company, inc.

Golf Team Downs Hamilton

Gertzberg, Pa

The Albany State varsity golf
team played its fifth match in a
week yesterday and in the process
closed out its first winning season
in five years.

Last Tuesday, the team hosted
Union College and were more
than hospitable as they dropped a
4-3 decision to the men from
Schenectady. The six individual
matches were split, three and
three, but the seventh point went
to Union by virtue of their lower
overall stroke total.

The following day, State
traveled to Syracuse to face
LeMoyne. Led by sophomore
Tom Patterson’s 73 and junior
Marv Gertzberg’s 74, the team
came away with a 6-3 victory. On
Friday, they traveled to Plattsburg

Albany State’s Varsity Tennis
Team boosted their
history-making record to 9-0, with
an 8-1 victory over Utica
yesterday. The victory tied a
Great Dane record for consecutive
wins.

The only loss State suffered all
afternoon was in the number one
singles contest, as Ron
McDermott was defeated in a
closely-fought contest, 7-5, 8-6.
This was the first loss handed to
Ron all season, and stopped his
consecutive win streak at eight.

Baseballers Set Back Utica
Brooklyn'Twin-Bill Saturday

' Albany‘s baseball team ran its '
record to eight wins and six losses
this past weekend as they
defeated Utica, 8-3.

The Danes were originally
scheduled to play a doubleheader
with Utica on Saturday, but were
rained out. The Sunday attempt
to play the twin bill was also
washed out resulting in the
playing of the single game on
Monday.

George Webb hurled no-hit ball
for the first six innings, and with
relief help picked up the win for
the Danes, Webb, the top winner
for Albany this year with a four
and two record, held Utica in
check until the sevent when they
erupted for two of their three
runs,

With Webb tiring in the eighth,
Couch Burlingnme went to his

bullpen and brought in George
Mar-gen who squelched Utica's
attempt to come back, thus saving
the game for Webb.

The Dunes put the game out of
reach in the fifth when they put
four runs across the plate. Singles
by Rich Spiers, Jim Lee, and Jack
Sinnott preceded a booming triple
by Jim Sandy.

Spiers and Sandy also supplied
big hits in the seventh frame when
the Danes collected three more
runs. Spiers slashed out a double
while Sandy added a single to the
cause,

The Danes have a
doubleheader scheduled
tomoorow against Brooklyn
beginning at 1:00. A large crowd
is expected since the game will be
one of the many events going on
during Parents Weekend.

Several walks ago, a very inconspicuous column appeared in th

space. "had, to do with the much talked about possibility of
intercollegiate club football next fall at Albany Siatc..In'easence, it
concluded that the only solid obstacle to institution was the. lack of
knowledge, in the Athletic Department and Central Council, that

there were enough men who would want to play the rough contact}

sport.

The column must have been quite inconspicuous for although it
was made clear that club football could easily become s'reslity,‘ no
group of individuals has, as yet, come to the Athletic Advisory Board
with a petition to institute the sport. Once again, let it be stressed that
the petition had to come from those who wanted to play the sport.

This has been the policy of late when instituting new sports and it
has worked with much success. Both the Sailing Club and the Lacross
Club began with petitions by interested participants. The policy

partially assures a successful club-at least it fulﬁlls the most basic“

prerequisite: ﬁelding a team.

It is both the Athletic Department’s and Central C0uncil's prime
concern that each new sport at least be given the prerequisites for
success. In demanding a petition from the participants, those who
have the most to do with the athletic" teams (coaching and
supervision-wise, and money-wise) are trying to assure the

prerequisites.

Discounting the facetious possibility that no one has approached
the Board actually because the column was inconspicuous, only one
explanation can be seen for the lack of action: there are not enough
men at this time at Albany State who wish to play the sport.

I go out with a whimper, not with a bang!

appear in the 1969 edition of

biographical “compilation
featuring the accomplishments of
approximately 5,000 young
atheletes who have proven
themselves outstanding in sports,

curriculum." They are seniors
Rich Margison, Scott Price seniors
Jack Sinnott, John Compeau, and
junior Jim Sandy.

’ As fai'as Margison is concerned,
little need be ‘ said about his
previous achievements at this

University. This honor is indeed a
fitting reward to an individual
who has a great deal of which to
be proud.

Price is also a most deserving
recipient. Hobbled by an ankle
injury this year, his performance
did not lack hustle and desire
which characterized his play
previously.

Sandy is a two letter
man,catching for the baseball
team, and in winter serving as the
sixth man for the basketball
squad. Sinnot is the starting first

baseman on the baseball team,

while Compeau captained the
