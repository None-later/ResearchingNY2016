ASP Feature Reporter

One of the more frequent
topics of discussion by the aware
student body of Albany State is
the campus architecture. It's a
rare week when students or
faculty are not complaining about
some facet of the grandiose
structure. Complaints such as:
poor acoustics, lack of visual
variety, or the sterility radiated by
the bland colors are very frequent.
It has been said that the
architecture was designed to
reflect the student bodv.

It has also been the delight of
certain individuals to perpetuate
rumors about the stupendous
structure. There have been stories
that the academic podium is
sinking, that the campus was
designed for Florida, and that the
tower on Indian Quad will only be
ten stories high.

All untrue says Mr. Hoopcs,
office manager for the architect's
office. There has also been
speculation as the fact that the
University is planning on building
another podium, this is also
untrue.

In the Fine Arts building lobby,
one will find a model of the
ﬁnished structure as of 1974. One
will also take relief in the
asymmetrical plan for the whole
campus. Mr. Hoopes says that the
present campus is actually not
that symmetrical; one may notice
that there is no dome between the
Administration and Fine Arts
buildings. One will also notice the

Stone

most glaring contradiction, the
water tower which is off center on
both axis.

Mr. Hoopcs explains that the
campus was designed for function
and points out that very few
Universities can be built up in five
years. He says that in future years
there will be more greenery to
give relief to the white and grey.
stone.

The man responsible for this
super magnanamous structure is
renowned Edward Durell Stone.
Mr. Stone at 67 is responsible for
a bevy of structures throughout
the world.

Mr. Stone has designed the U.S.
Embassy in India, Civic Center in
New York, JFK Performing Arts
Center in Washington and has
bcen a consultant for the,
Verazunno-Narrows bridge; this is
only a small sample.

At present, Stone has designed
the Institute of Nuclear Science
and Technology in Pakistan which
looks remarkably like the Albany
Campus. When I asked Mr.
Hoopes about the similarity in
Stone’s architecture he said that
once an architect designs
something that is successful he
likes to utilize its popularity in
other designs.

Whether or not one is satisfied
with the sterile appearance,
symmetrical desing, cold concrete,
or smalll living quarters; the
taxpayers of New York have spent
$104,000,000 for this phase of

the campus construction--so enjoy. .

A People-Oriented University

by Dean 0. William Perlrntmer
College of Art! and Sciences

(Editors' note: this essay was
written at the request of the
editors in order to lend
perspective to the paths this
Universin will follow so that it
may fulfill its educational goal:
Lel each become all that he is
capable of being.)

A university is a human
creation. People define its
goals and methods, and these

change with time. As a living
institution, the university is
always in process of becoming; it
has no fixed essence like the
things of chemistry or
mathematics; [I has only a history
and an uncertain future.

For a long time it has been
traditional to describe and define
universities in abstract terms, that
is, as institutions concerned with
gathering, transmitting and
advancing knowledge. I believe
that the university of our time
and lhc near future must now be
described in more concrete and
human terms.

The “free university" of the
future should be a model of
self-goverance, dedicated to the
human development of its
members and to the improvement
of society. I see the State
University of New York at Albany
as becoming an outstanding
examplc of this new kind of
univt-rsity.

Sell-governance.

Let me speak of self-governance
ﬁrst.

As a legal and corporatc entity,
the university should eventually
,cmbrace all of its members as part
of the corporation; policy and
decision-making should become
functions shared by all -not only
students and faculty, but also
people in support positions. If
you work or study in the
institution, you have a stake in
what happens. Policy should be
based on consent freely obtained
and distilled through the
processes of

The order of priority would be
to serve: 1)studcnts in their quest
for human fulfillment; 2) the
needs of society; 3) the needs of
the techno-stru turn

t present, I e order is usually
reversed. A university must do all
three. If it does only the first, it is

' a finishing school; If only the last,
0

a technical institute; and if it only

° serves society, it is a totalitarian
' institution.

When I speak of serving
students and human fulfillment,

' our topic is really undergraduate

education. High priority should be

given to implementing last year’s
report, "New Patterns of
Undergraduate Education,"
especially the establishment of
diverse experimental colleges. Let
me review two that were
mentioned and suggest a new one.

The Experimental College

This would combine the last
part of high school (two or three
years?) and the first two years of
college. It should be the entry
point for the economically and
socially disadvantaged, together
with the culturally disadvantaged
from white middle class suburbia.

We solve two major problems
with this type of unit: the
articulation of school and college
and the provision of systematic
preparation for university-level
studies to member of depressed
groups.

Educating the children of the
poor, redressing the bitter
injustices of the past, and reaching

equity among all racial and ethnic
groups in the society—this is our
most urgent problem. We have yet
to take that magnificent American
step, the “all-out" effort. New
York State should lead the way.

The General College

This unit should be come the
heart of undergraduate education
at SUNYA. The report envisages it
as a two-year nonvdepartmental
interdisciplinary school,
experimental and innovative in
character, carrying out liberal,
humane education in a
contemporary manner. It is
requested in the l970-1971
budget.

College of Transnational Studies

To prepare leaders for the
modern world, I propose a
three-year college leading to an
MA. in the social sciences and
humanities, with programs in a
variety of fields requiring an
international background and a
mastery of two or more cultures.

This college would aim at
producing a hi'cultural person.

Comparative studies, teaching,
international administration, are a
few of the possible areas of
studies.

Entrance requirements would
include mastery of two languages,
plus academic achievement,
aptitude and a deep sense of
personal dedication.

Each program would require a
minimum of one year of study
abroad.

More about this at another
time.

Parlormlng Arts

A people-oriented university
should become an active cultural
center. For the Albany campus
this indicates an enormous growth
in the performing arts, especially
theatre, music, and art. We Inm-
some of the finest physical
facilities in the world, and tlwy
should be generously supported
and used with daring and
imagination. The people of llu'

Few others have had the
opportunity to develop the
perspective over this University
that President Collins has from 20
years experience in his position.

From his vantage point, the
primary function of the
University is to provide a free
forum for learning both old and
new ideas.

However, he emphasizes that
“ideas are not static. for
knowledge to be alive it needs to
be transmiteed, taught, discussed
and applied.

“Knowledge for its own sake
gets sterile, precious. It has to be
tested, used, in order to be viable.
It is used in its applied forms in
the professions.

“The big advantage of this
institution, is that it has,
historically, combined
professional and liberal arts
preparation.

"The core is the arts and
sciences with the professional
school based around and
bencfitting from this liberal
education.”

READINESS FOR CHANGE

“The 1960’s everybody agrees,
has seen all kinds of explosions
most notably in the areas of
population increase, technology
and human aspirations or
expectations.

“The attitude now is that it
(the world we live in) can be
better, we want it better and we‘ll
make it better.

“People are ready and more
than that, determined to bring

change. Now we have the
opportunity and implements for
change.

concerned when he steps down as President this year.

and skeptical of the relevancy of
the university to the changes that
are and will be made. Some have
reached the conlusion that the
entire university is irrelevant.
Collins, from his perspective, feels
a little different.

“Courses,” he says, “Don’t
have a relationship to each other
or to the students' problems
except as he coordinates them in
his own mind.

“Relevance is established when
the student takes a course with
this in mind. A course is relevant
when the individual has a use for
it.

“Students make the course
make sense; the ‘goodncss' or
‘badncss’ of a course varies with
the individual's purpose.

“Students feel the generation
preceding them hasn’t done such a
good job; lhcy arc impatient with
the rate of change.

The University Becoming

Continued from page 6

Since language and literature
are among the most humanizlng
of the disciplines, they will have a
vital role to play in this kind of

university and should be
intimately linked to our
transnational and multicultural

cfforts. In this connection, we
should add to the strength we
already have in Romance
languages and continue to build in
German and Slavic studies. Special
efforts are already under way in
Afro-American studies. Parallel to
these are new efforts in Hebrew
and related languages, as well as
Asian studies. Capitalizing on our
position in the State of New
York, we should take a leadership
role in Latin American studies,
with emphasis upon Pucrto Rico.
What many people consider the
problem of New York State,
namely its ethnic diversity, is its
greatest educational opportunity
and a source of intellectual
leadership.

Graduate study in the United
States is in a rut. As we develop
new programs at the mustch and
doctoral level, we should carefully

reexamine Leaching methods,
degrees, and program offerings in
order to bring about radical
improvcnivnts in graduate
education, A report similar to our
umlcrgraduatc study is, in my
opinion, now needed.

I lcavo the social sciences until
last, since this is my own field. In
a sense, lhcy can fulfill an
urchitcctonic role and provide an
over-all design for llll' various
studies of the university. The
concepts of environmental
studios, urbanism,
transnationalism, autonomous
undergraduate colleges, and
human development, relate
directly to ideas and methods
from the social sciences. Another
way of putting this is to conceive
of the univorsily as an intcr- and
cross-disciplinary affair, cutting
across ethnic and national
boundaries, pluralistic in approach

and dedicated to human
fulfillment in an environment of
mature self-determination.

On the balance, I would say we
have made considerable headway
since we first assumed university
status. It has been painful at
times, but this is a normal part of
growth. We need also to rcmind
ourselves that a plurality of goals
does not mean that one cancels
out another; and we must not be
overcome by the complexity of
our task. A great university must
do many things and do them
superbly, with artistry or at least
with high craftsmanship.

TRUTH

The idea that the University's
function is to uphold the
standards, values, and morals of
the society within which it exists
is, to some. repulsive.

President Collins believes that
the University must, “as well as it
knows how, uphold the standards
of society while, at the same time
subjecting them to critical
evaluation and reﬁnement.

“It needs to leach the truth the
best that it knows the truth and it
must strive to discover new
truths."

for critical evaluation of
established ideas and values, the
University must be without
coercion of any kind from those
within it or those in the civil
community.

THE FUTURE
Collins now would like to
instruct graduate students in

adminstration of higher education
and personnel services at a
University that offers active
programs.

believes the University experience
has aided them in asking more
intelligent questions. “You won't

The issue of discrimination on
construction work forces has been
brought to the attention of the
University faculty administration
because of the demonstrations
that have stopped construction
(on the same issue) at Buffalo
University.

The cause of those
dcmonstrations is the consistent
refusal of trades unions to
integrate their labor forces.

Buffalo students have
coordinated their “Work For All"
movement with community
efforts for minority group
employment.

As reported by Rick Schwab in
the Buffalo SPECTRUM, “There
is a resolve in the University that
the campus (new Amherst campus
estimated at $600 million) will be
built with nn integrated work
force.

There is also resolve in many
students' minds that campus will”
not be built unless the work cre'ws
are integrated.

It is expected that similar
responses will be evoked if it is
found by our Facultvatudcnt
Committee that discrimination is
being practised among unions
constructing this campus.
