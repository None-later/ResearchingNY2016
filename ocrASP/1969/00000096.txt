it Is a shame that more
publicity hasn’t been given
Boultlng Brother’s production,
TWISTED NERVE. The film has
only one nime star, a grown
Haley Mills, which is hardly
enough to make movie-goers
break down the doors.

It is indeed . tragic that a film
such as TWISTED NERVE has to
struggle to break even when
unartistic trash such as THE
CARPETBAGGERS makes
millions simply becuase its
producers have the financial
resources to purchase expensive
advertising. Despite the fact that
TWISTED NERVE will probably
be a box office failure, it will also

_be remembered as one of the best

films of 1969.

The film starts out slowly.
Director Roy Boulting builds
scene upon scene, always giving us
hints at what is to come. The
movie opens with Martin, alias
Georgie, (Hywell Bennet) playing
ball with his Mongoloid brother.

We get insight into Martin's
character when we see the
dissension in his home life. He
hates his stepfather, and at one
point his overly protective mother
says, “Sometimes i don't think
you care for anyone." We don’t
realize the full importance of this
line until after Martin has killed
his stepfather. Then it is
connected with a young medical
student's comment that a
psychopath is a person who has
no conscience and cares for no

one but himself.

The first 35 minutes of the film
are weak. Their sole‘ purpose is to
establish the setting, Georgia's
character and sickness. The scenes
are often tedious and somewhat
sloppy in their construction. They
are rather unsophisticatedly built.
The camera work in this section is
below standard. occasionally
cutting off the tops of heads. \

From the time Georgie picks up
those deadly scissors and the
camera focuses on their ghastly
reflection of the pantry light,
everything seems to pull together.
The Boulting Brothers have
learned their film-making from
watching other films. From here
on out they borrow heavily from
Alfred Hitchcock‘s classic,
PSYCHO.

Their best devices are not
.original, but are successful bits
stolen from other films. The crane
shot in Susan’s (Miss Mills') home
is right out of CHARLY, although
it is enhanced further by some
sharp, sophisticated editing.
Susan’s mother looks and acts like
Mrs. Robinson with the added
Von Stroheimian twist that she
wants to make it with a
simpleton.

Georgia‘s cutting up of his Mrs.
Robinson with a hatchet is shot
from the same angle and precision
as it was in Bette Davis’
STRAIGHTJACKET. It is almost
impossible to watch that closing
sequence of Georgie sitting in jail,

State F air funds
aid ambassadors

In the midst of the excitement
generated by preparations for
tomorro’s State Fair, a great many
people on campus fail to realize
the very purpose of the Fair itself:
that the proceeds from the event
will be used for scholarships to
bring foreign students to Albany
State for a year of study.

Diversity in its student body
can only serve to enrich a
University. Foreign students on
campus implement an
intercultural exchange by living
and studying with American
students. SUNYA‘s foreign
students contribute to and also
benefit from campus life.

According to Mr. J. Paul Ward.
the international student adviser.
there are far too few foreign
students on campus today. there
are only 150 students.
representing 40 countries. Of this
number, only ten are
undergraduates.

NOTICE

“

Chad Walsh, poet, author, and
anthologist, will read and discuss
his poetry at 8:15 pm. on
Wednesday, May 21, in the
Assembly Hall of the Campus
Center. A professor of English at
Beloit (Wis.) College, he was a
Fulbright lecturer in Americzm
literature in 1957-68.

The primary reason for this
small number is lack of funds. In
recent years the cost of ﬁnancing
one student‘s year of study has
risen from about $1600 to over
$2000.

A scholarship provides the
foreign student with room, board,
tuition, books, linen, insurance
and a small monthly stipend for
expenses; the student must
provide his own transportation to
Albany.

Scholarships are usually given
to students from developing
nations.

Selection of scholarship
recipients is the responsibility of a
student-faculty committee
composed of five faculty
members and two students. This
committee meets after State Fair
to determine how much profit
was made and how it will be
distributed among incoming
student ambassadors.

State Fair represents the sole
source of money to finance a
foreign student's year of study at
Albany State. This State Fair was
conceived with the goal of making
it possible for foreign students to
broaden the dimension of the
University while gaining personal
benefits. Since then, these
purposes have made State Fair an.
annual event.

 

 

 

 

calling for Sue's without thinking
of Anthony Per ins In PSYCHO.
However, even‘with the beat of‘
several movies, this film still could
have been unsucceuful, if it were
not for the excellent editing that
tied each of these scenes to the
next. This is obvious in the cut
from Georgie raising the hatchet
to kill Susan's mother to a
medical chart of twisted blood-red
chromosomes.

As for the acting, all the actors
perform so well that the plot
remains suspenseful throughout
the film. This is not to say it is
too ominous or heavy.
Scriptwriter Leo Marks
thoughtfully provides the
audience with comic relief. His
sequence where the medical
student diagnoses an intestinal
infection for a woman whose only
malady is an overdose of laxative
can be compared favorably with
Shakespeare’s drunken porter
scene in MACBETH.

All the characters are
ingeniously necessary to the plot
except for Jerry (Frank Finlay), a
broken-down film editor. His
presence is by no means a flaw, as
he also provides needed laughs
with his drunken comments on
sex and violences in films.

Photographer Harvey Waxman
and the other members of the
Boulting staff have a decided flair
for suspense and drama.
U nfortunately, their
routine-establishing sequences are
just that, routine.

Also there is one routine
sequence which is edited out of
order. The reason
for this is unknown; perhaps they
needed what is commonly known
as a “cheat shot" and hoped no
one would notice. It is, however,
quite noticeable.

If it weren’t for flaws such as
these, the Brother Boulting would
have created a minor masterpiece.
Yet even with its flaws, it is still
far above the average as an art
work.

THE SIXTH STREET THEATRE repertory group will appear this
Saturday evening at 9:00 p.m. at The Golden Eye, 820 Madison Ave.

The ballroom is to be decorated
for a night clubvcabaret type
atmosphere.

The traditional Homecoming
