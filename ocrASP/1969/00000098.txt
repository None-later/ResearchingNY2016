Mathias
censured

by Nancy Durilh

At last night’s Central Council
meeting, in a proposal introduced
by . ten representatives, the
members of the Council by a vote
of l0-8-6, officially censured Terry
Mathias, the President of Student
Association.

The move stemmed from a bill
passed last week in Council
concerning alcohol at the
University's “Wild, Wild
Weekend ,' ' and Mathias'
subsequent actions taken on that
bill.

According to the bill, the
members of the Council are
censoring Mathias because he,
inspite of his duty to carry out
the “Wild, Wild Weekend"bill,
attempted to obstruct the
enaction of the bill.

Mathias took it upon himself to
reverse the decision of the valid
bill, and since the president of
Central Council does not possess
the legislative mandate necessary
to issue directives dealing with
policy making, some Council
members felt the need for
censure.

The “Wild, Wild Weekend” bill,
passed the night before the actual
start of the weekend event, stated
that the Quad flagrooms were to
be completely open for alcohol. A
question arose over the bill as to
whether it was a valid
interpretation of the University‘s
Alcohol Policy.

Mathias carried out the bill’s
instructions by notifying all
administrative persons concerned
regarding the bill the next
morning. Friday afternoon,
however, he issued a notice to
those same people which reversed
the bill, and consequently, no
alcohol was allowed in the
flag'rooms during the events.

Mathias explained that after-

Students to occupy
a third of Senate

by Diane McNamara

As a result of the many
demonstrations and strikes on
campuses across the country,
university students, faculty, and
administrators have begun to
reassess their roles and
participation in the university
community. One vital question
concerns the relative participation
in and control over the

of the ' ' y. Th

Not unlike other universities,
Albany State is undergoing a
change in the makeup of its
administration. The primary
target of change is the Faculty
Senate.

Traditionally the representative
body of the faculty, the Senate
coordinates and regulates policy
and activities through a number of
councils which deal with
curriculum, admissions, academic
standing on undergraduate levels,
academic planning, library policy.

Benezet chosen President

The new president of the State
University of New York at Albany
will be Dr. Louis 1' Benezet,
currently president of the
Claremont University Center,
Claremont, effective July 1, 1970.
Dr. Allan A. Kuusisto will
continue as acting president
during the current academic year.

Dr. Benezet said he looks
forward to his Albany assignment
as ‘a unique opportunity to direct
the growth of a major new

' "y with a "' ' mission
in arts, sciences, and professional
schools.‘

Claremont University Center,
where Benezet has been president
since 1963, is the coordinating
institution of the six privately
controlled Claremont Colleges,
the f" ‘ C “ ‘ Center,
and many joint educational

enterprises. The Center has
pioneered the cluster idea in
Nhich independent colleges share
key facilities and program.

The State University trustees
appointed Benezet to the post of
president, September 17. He was
unanimously recommended by
the SUNYA University Council. A
committee of students, faculty
and University Council members
were active in the selection
process.

Benezet has formerly been
,_ "‘ ‘ofC‘ -‘ Collegeand
Allegheny College. He has also
worked in administrative capacity
at Syracuse University.

Benezet has had teaching
experience as a psychology
professor. He has also published
numerous articles on higher

concerns.

Although the President is
technically responsible for 'policy
decisions, the Senate is
empowered to initiate and
implement policy changes.

Last fall the Senate approved a
resolution allowing student.
participation on the Faculty
Senate councils and committees.

e ‘ ‘ were given equal
representation on these councils
and committees, but were barred
from the Senate itself.

Central Council and the
Student Association cabinet,
charged with electing or
appointing students to the Senate
councils and committees, found
few were willing to accept the
responsibilities. The result was
that students already
overburdened with Central
Council and Student Association
iuties took on these added
responsibilities.

Later that year student James
Kahn (Albany '69) wrote what he
considered to be a valid
constitution for a university
government. it called for a
governing body of 50 students
and 50 faculty members which
would oversee the work of the
Faculty Senate. This proposal was
given to the executive committee
of the Faculty Senate.

The council did not act on
Kahn‘s proposal but it considered
student participation on the
Faculty Senate itself. A
committee chaired by Dr.
Thorstensen of the English
Department and composed of
both students and faculty was
