Results of the National Teacher

Examinations are used by many'

large school districts as one of
several factors in the selection of
new teachers and by several states
for certification or licensing of
teachers. Some colleges also
require all seniors preparing to
teach to take the examinations.
The school systems and state
departments of education which
use the examination results are
designated in the Bulletin of
Information for Candidates.

On each full day of testing,
prospective teachers may take the
Common Examinations, which
measure their professional
preparation and general cultural

background, and a Teaching Area
xamination which measures

mastery of the subject they
expect to teach.
rrospective teachers should

contact the school systems in
which they seek employment, or
their colleges, for specific advice
The Bulletin of Information
for Candidates contains a list of
test centers, and information
about the examinations, as well as
a Registration Form. Copies may
be obtained from college
placement officers, school
personnel departments, or directly

The basis for Council's action,
on the bill stems from the recent
meeting of the general faculty on
Sept. 11, during which approval
was given allowing 22 undergrads
and 11 graduate students to
become full members of the
Faculty Senate.

A rally in support of Johnson’s
induction, refusal will be held at
IO am October 1 in front of the
Old Post Office Building
(Induction Center) on the corner
of State Street and. Broadway In
Albany. Arrangements are being
nade for students to meet and

talk with Eric Johnson Monday
afternoon or evening.

Johnson also stated that his
refusal of induction should not be
interpreted as refusing the
American way of life. "I do not
hate or disrespect our laws, our
Congress, or our President. But I
know of no government that is
willing to voluntarily disarm' ."

Evans and his wife, 's graduate

of SUNYA are supporting
Johnson's action to show their
willingness "to stand with him"
and show their symbolic support.

Evans turned in his own draft
card in January after he had been
classified as a conscienetlous
objector because he had no desire
to comply in any way with the
Selective Service. He is currently
awaiting to be indicted.

Faculty Senate, renamed the

members, and the thirty-three
students to be elected in October.
It will handle all matters
concerning academic affairs at the
University, as well as many
problems arising with student
regulations.

The new representation,
according to Vic Looper,
Vice-President of Student Assoc.,
is a major change in University
governance, and a major step in
the strengthening of cooperation
between faculty and students.

In other action, Council
appropriated $4,000 to be used in

Education Center. Due to this
year's budget cuts, the gym has
