MUL‘l'l-TALENTED JOHN BLAIR, currently appearing at the Coffee
HouseZCircuit, drillfully blends music and karate'with unique results

---gold

Blair gives audience
a ismashing’ time

by Alan Laskcr

Guitar strumming, violin
harmonizing, commanding
vocalist John Blair, a fourth
degree black belt, is probably the
only Coffee House Circuit
violinist who smashes bricks with
his hands.

Opening with a medley on
the violin combining “Shadow of
Your Smile," "By the Time [Get
to Phoenix," and other popular
tunes with his own creations.
John Blair shocked his audience;
he broke the traditional one-act
folk singing performance by
merging three relatively unrelated
acts into one.

The notes of his violin
blended melancholy and joy with
romance. Mr. Blair expressed life’i
emotions through the vibrating
sound of a violin and
demonstrated through his
countenance that he was sincere
in his playing.

Proceeding quickly, he
strapped on his guitar and
vocalized several tunes that
carried a message. “If You Want
to Be Free," the selection I
particularly enjoyed, relates that
in order for one to be free, he
must build himself and not rely
on others to mold him.

Another selection dealt with
love and its power to replace the
empty feelings within a lonely
person.

Part three of his prop-arr.
commenced with a Karate form,
utilizing the sale (knife-like
weapons). He proceeded to smash
a brick noting afterwards that a
person’s mind can travel in any
direction and eventually reach its
desired destination; in other
words, brickemashing is more
psychological than physical. Mr.
Blair concluded his performance
by requesting members of the

 

 

audience to participate along with
him on stage. The volunteers
learned certain modes of
self-defense. Incorporate musical
talent and self-defense tactics with
imagination: the unique result-a
John Blair experience.

The only disturbing event of
the evening was the continual
opening and closing of the deal
between the snack bar and the
cafeteria. Not only is it annoying
for ti 9 audience, but most
unpleasant for the performer.
Either the platform should be
placed on the other side of the
cafeteria'. or the door should be
locked while a performance is in
session. While Blair was
performing there was just no
excuse for the continual
interrupting and most obnoxious
squeak. Hopefully, the people in
charge will take some action to
insure this does not occur with
future guests.

«Bob Dylan
When ' I left John

the Johnny Cash song who lei-l I
chair smashed across his teeth.
Midnight Cowboy in a gritty kick
in the groin, a journey throulih
the reeking back alleys of
underground New York, peering
into the trash can lives of the
creatures who inhabit and haunt
the dead end streets. It is a
nightmare collage of human
‘isolation, perversion, and the
terrifying, desperate need to be
needed. It captures a side of life
we never witness; a ghetto
country of cripples, hustlers and
deviants who have one thing in
common: their suicidal loneliness.
Isolation is the real, ever-present
horror of this film. The morbid
undercurrent of fear dominates
the story of Joe Buck and Enrico
‘Ratso' Rlzzo, the human jetsam
who latch onto each other in a
furtive struggle to crawl out of the
sewer.

Joe Buck (Jon Voight,) a
roustabout stud from Dallas, hops
a bus via New York for a few
lucra ive lays. Well, he ﬁnds out
that he green fields of the city
are actually concrete and the
people find it easier to be hard.
After a frustrating boudoir
adventure, Joe forks over what’s
left in his cowhide wallet to a
sniveling, grubby little chiseler
named Ratso Rizzo (Dustin
Hoffman), who promises to
manage ' Him in the perpetual
orgasm business. Ratso splits with
the dough, and by the time Joe
collars him, all that’s left is

fifty-four cents and a [few gum
wrappers. Undaunted, Ratso
decides that maybe the
ostentatious cowpoke might make
a worthwhile hustler after all and
begs him to share his apartment in
a crumbling, condemned building.
Ratso has visions of raking in
enough bread before winter hits
so they can board a bus for the
orange groves and milk white
beaches of Florida. Joe agrees to
peddle his flesh; but winter
comes, the till is empty, and our
Anti-heroes are freezing, amid a
crescendo of ‘orange juice on ice
is nice‘ commercials issuing from
Joe's radio

When Ratso can no
longer drag his grimy foot around
the gutters and begins incinerating
with a fever, Joe faces the cruddy
realization that they are both
doomed in their sub-zero
dungeon. The last thirty minutes
of this film show the desperate
lengths a man will go to help a
friend literally on his last Has
Joe mounts a desperate
campaign to get money for the
bus trip. They ﬁnally escape the
miserable hovel and catch their
bus, but not before the grossness
of their existence pulverizes both
of them. The empathy is genuine
and the horror a jolting jab
beneath the bolt. John Voight

‘of his dislocated past. He was an
unwanted child raised by a-
hairdreaser cum whore w om he
called his grandmaw. A passionate
love affair with a country girl
ended one night in a disastrous,
terrifying gang rape by a group of'
brutal ranch hands as Schlesinger’s
fast cut ﬂashback technique

explores these deep-rooted
beginnings of Joe’s sexual
neyrosis. '

Voight himself is a remarkable
innocent in search of a broad. The
handsome, muscular actor,
making his screen debut, ’exhibits
hilarious, absurd naivete as the
longhorned lover who hasn't quite
got the heart to hustle either sex.
Despite his solid performance as
Joe Buck, it is Dustin Hoffman’s
Rstso that gnaws at the memory
long after you leave the theater.
Ratso is an annoying little gnat of
a man, a limping sychophant
whose pathetic plight underlies
the misery of the handicapped
everywhere. As far as ‘normal'
humanity is concerned the
physically handicapped are a
useless subculture cut off from
the mainstream of living, and
unfortunately we seem content to
leave it that way. A stark close-up
of Hoffman’s grimy, fever-racked
face sums up all the abject terror
instilled in these unwanted
people. His line, ‘You know what
they do to people who can't
walk...Joe I'm scared,’ is an icy
knife in the back, as though
storm troopers are bounding up
the staircase ready to take him
away for final elimination. It is a
desperate moan from a human
being who doesn’t want to be left
alone or forgotten.

Hoffman‘s
electrifying performance proves
that he is emerging as one of the
most formidable actors of"t'his,
decade. The supporting cast,
headed by Brenda Vaccaro, John
McGiver, Ruth White and Svlvia
Miles, execute their walk—through
roles brilliantly. Waldo Salt’s

Midnight Cowboy is a slimy

inner city and the people trapped
in its vicious clutches. It forces us
to stare the bleak emptiness of
loneliness and longing ' liiu face,

applause subsided,
Olatunji welcomed us, this being
his second visit in a year, to “an
exciting safari through musical
Africa."

“Contrary to the Hollywood

'I‘arzan, Jane or Sabu. Music and that of the diamond miners of
dance form a universal language South Africa who are paid only

we hope to communicate." And
Olatunji concluded, "People
without a culture are not a
people."

I sensed an intrinsic faith of
Olatunji's in peace, goodwill and
the giving of thanks for the
blessings of the land. He and his
accompaniment crystallized this
in an African song of
thanksgiving, “Adunda Adunda,"
with a different, heavier heat than
the ﬁrst song.

The song is recorded on
Olatunji's "Drums of Passion"
album. With four women dancers
in bright red skirts and white
blouses and barechested men with
colorful shell necklaces, their
expressive and graceful
movements setting their entire
bodies in motion, the music
communicates successfully. The

theme of joy is sensed
immediately from the bright
cheerful singing and dance.

Olatunji sings of the people’s
thanks for rain and the harvest
and for blessings in the New Year.

The dances are graceful and
vibrant. Arms, legs and bodies
flail; all the body communicates
passionately with those driving

ideal, this is not the music for rhythms.

 

At this point I could not help
but think that the unique
powerful rhythms I was hearing, if
exposed more, would lead the
'way for the next fifty years of
pop music. The old blues, rock,
and country rhythms will one day
lBOOI'l bore artists and listeners
alike, and the untapped sources of
black musical wealth will be their
musical salvation.

With beads of sweat visibly
rolling down his forehead and the
rhythm never-ceasing, Olatunji
said, "I can just imagine being at
home with thousands of people
dancing and singing. Look at
Woodstock, too; you are getting
to that stage. If people will only

' “ All the dances tellasignificant had tel
story," Olatunji explained,“like Power"

$1.25 a week. Well, you know,
you can‘t kill a man's spirit..."
And drurris poured forth a rhythm
which seemed to cry "free! free!"

Olatunji spoke of how
important it is for man to take
care of his body. in illustration of
this, Ali, a |dancer|of strange
“Plbmﬁﬁ‘ did a dance of
contortions featuring
bone-bending headstands, a dog

position, and a fascinating
“human split." Ali was so
incredibly limber that the

positions he performed defied the
imagination. He placed his arms,
legs, and trunk in "impossible"
stances like the “fish” and the
"cobra." ,

With Ali's performance
concluded, Olatunji called him
back for another bow before the
appreciative audience. Olatunji
encouraged \us to try it, too. V

And then dancers poured out in
black and yellow striped costumes
with tall colorful hats. Their
dance was playful and often
erotic. Olatunji recalled, as the
music continued, how the drums
[of Africa are signiﬁcant in
village-to-village communications,
and how rhythm is considered the
'soul of life. "No one can resist
rhythm. It is heartbeat itself l" he
said. Perhaps this is the organic
essence of a sensitive performer’s
philosophy, and the meaning of
this exciting black music for all of
us.

“And man should respect
nature and life. There are ﬁve
things which a man seeks in his
religion: his manner of conduct, a
source of consolation, a road to
prosperity, a place of refuge, and
a place of peace.”

The ﬁnal encore gave way to
the long applause and then the
drone of the crowds filing out.

lights coalesced.mornentarily in
my mind as a place of worship. I
