It was a dark and stormy night.

‘Now, just what do you mean,

The King choked, and, sobbing,
murmured, ‘Read this.’

The Wizard took the tearstained
parchment and read, ‘Honorary

President Allan A. Kuusisto
re-affirmed past encouragement of
student affairs.

Kuusisto advised that he would
keep open present avenues of
communication including weekly
meetings with students.

Dr. Kuusisto then
expressed his interest in student
participation in university
decision-making and cited some
important developments in this
area.

In addition, Kuusisto revealed
that in order to bring himself into
closer contact with students'
problems, William Seymour has
been appointed to a position of
‘omnbudsman.’ Seymour will be
available to help in' solving
academic or other problems of
students that cannot be resolved
at lower administrative levels.

In turning the floor over to the
students attending the meeting,
Dr. Kuusisto was then presented
with a serious situation developing
in the area where Alumni Quad is
located. Attacks upon University
students by Albany teens were
reported, the most. serious of
which occurred this past weekend.
Dr. Clifton Thorne, Vice President
for Student Affairs, answered the
comments of concerned Alumni
Quad residents. Thorns
mentioned that he had been in
consultation with Albany police
during the morning, and that
more police security would be
provided to residents of the
downtown dorms. He asked the
residents of Alumni Quad to avoid
organizing vigilante groups.
Thorns stressed that students
hung on the downtown campus
should rely upon the local police
and university security guards for
protection.

THE SEPTEMBER CONVOCATION SYMBOLICALLY welcomed all new students into the University

Community with the traditional candlelight ceremony.

Meadows: ‘Restless Campus

and the Unﬁnished Society’

Editors Note: In one of the finest
speeches heard on this campus in
a long while, Dr. Paul
Meadows,f-feod of the Soc and
Anthré} Department, addressed
himself to the problems of the
"Restless Campus and the
Unfinished Society’” In
recognition of the value of the
ideas expressed, we have
excerpted the highlights of his
speech, delivered at the Freshman
Convocation.

The French word for the
university EtudentS’ protest
movement in 1968 was not our
word “demonstration” but
manifestation. “Today,” the
Parisian merchants would explain
to their upset customers, “today
we are having a manifestation." if
they will forgive the play on
words, the distinction is
intriguing: it suggests that when
ghetto and campus alike have
been demonstrating their anger
and rage, their strength’nnd their
thrust for power, they have also
been manifesting something.

But manifesting what? The
answers I have been hearing are by
no means unanimous. Thus, the
Gallup poll reported American

parents' reactions toward student

demonstrators as: “undisciplined

behavior," “lack of respect for
authority," “over-indulged
youth," “just plain
irresponsibility," “smuggness,”
among other evaluations. But
Gallup with fine impartiality
reported student complaints
about their elders: "too set in
their ways," “lack of
communication," (i.c., "they
won't listen to us"), “too
conservative," “indifferent,”
“apathetic,” “racial prejudice,"

amongothers.
The explanation
commonly

discussions of today’s troubles is
"gap," particularly “generational
gap." This popular interpretation
has much to support it. There is,
for example, the fact of numbers
American
people today are under 25 years
of age; over 6 millions of them are

2,300
colleges and universities; and a
fast-growing minority of them
have become activists, both on

alone. Half of the

now enrolled in some

campus and in town.

But numbers alone do not
explain the gap. The restless
mpuses and towns in turmoil
must be explained in other terms.
we can by ‘Way of
explanation start, as physicist

Thus.

Harrison Brown recently did, with
global matters: with the doubling
during the last decade of world
expenditures for armaments, now
totalling some 200 billion dollars
MHUBHY. with massive nuclear
military deterrent systems and the
world spread of nuclear military
“choices; with the fact that our
global military budgets are now
equal to the annual income
Pmduced by the one billion
People livins in Latin America,
Asia and the Near East; and with
the fact of Vietnam.

The gap can also be explained in
less global terms, in terms which
reflect our own national history
and society. Thus, one can point
to the gap between the incredible
national affluence and the
stupefying national poverty; the
gap between a resplendent
technology and an ugly
civilization; the gap between space
shots that land on the moon and
urban renewal programs that land
(when they land at all) in a
bureaucratic wilderness; the gap
between machines with built-in
purposes and human beings with
no purpose at all; and the gap
between institutional promises
and institutional performances.

mentioned in

fact that there has always been a
major gap in the American
society. We started as a nation in
angry protest over the gulf which
English colonialism created
between the rights of Englishmen
at home in the motherland and of
Englishmen overseas. And then as
a new nation, with marvelous
irony, we urmed ourselves with a
piece of paper, a piece of paper
which created for our entire
national history a great chasm
between what we wanted to be as
u nation and what in fact we are:
a gap between our constitutional
ideals of liberty and equality, law
and order and our institutional
practices which violated them; it
gap' between republican
democracy and mass democracy;
between Roussesuun popular will
and elitist decision-making;
between common man aspirations
and middle-class dominance;
nationalism and localism;

between . .
between agrarianism an
lndustrlalism.

This chasm between our

Y

---lee

professed ideals and our actual
practices has shown up in
countless protest movements and
organized violence over the years
of our nationhood. Indeed, there
has never been a decade in our
national history free of the
clamorous demands of some
national movement or movements
protesting the hypocrisy or failure
or inadequacy or even sheer
absence of our national efforts to
live up to our own national creed.

III

What i am saying is that an
historical perspective is crucial
today, if we are to understand and
if we are to come to terms as a
people with the agonizing angers
and threatening hates of our own
time, angers and hates in which
our campuses participate and
which our young people reﬂect.

But I must also insist that such
understanding requires at least
these two things. It means
knowing in what ways our social
unrest and discontents today stem
from and share the American
culture, what they have in
common with the American
culture. But understanding also
means that we must know in what
ways the hostility and the rage of
our day are different. We must
know both the common bonds
and the differences. For the first
alone will only make us
optimistic, to the point of
unforgivesble complacency; the
second alone, pessimistic to the
point of irremediable nihilism.

To the students of American
social history and American
society there is something very
familiar about the student
movements, the movements of the
Black community, the hippies and

the yippies. The familiarity can be
brought out in a number of
common themes which they share
with American suffragist,
abolition, labor, peace, public
education, municipal reform,
prison reform, child labor and
other historic movements. One
such common theme is suggested
by a recent comment by Dick
Gregory: “One of the problems is
that the Establishment keeps lying
to you young people 24 hours a
day and then after you catch us
lying, we say lt'sia generation gap.
it's a moral gap." For every great
social movement the problem has
always been a moral gap, a gap
between creed and deed, thei esi
and the real.

There is the theme of a

community of suffering..whioh..

‘Today class, we're talking about dilution; you know
learning-or maybe these are two different concepts“; If you want to”
know about learning you might ask Pavlov or better yet ask Pavlov’s
dog, the dog doesn’t know how to lie. But what are we getting st-I'nl
lecturing at you and you‘re getting bored, i'm preaching and you want
to cry out ‘Bullshit’;'| but you are afraid‘. I'm exercising my ego while
at the same time fearing the truth and locking myself inside my own
ideas about life in the University community. ,

Oh well, we are here to receive a degree so that we willbe better
qualified to improve our society. To get a better job you need a better
education. But to get a betur society we need less ‘eduted’ people
and more individuals willing to know their own ignorances.

But what are we really'saying? Let us go back to the night of
the Convocation when Dr. Paul Meadows spade of student
demonstrations as being manifestations. What Dr. Meadows failed to
point out was that the Convocation itself was a manifestation of
ritualized boredom and lack of creativity.

Surely what Meadows had to say has_beeome cliched; for has it
not become a cliche to speak of QOVUrtyl in the affluent society,
millions for the space program and budget cuts in welfare spending
sophisticated machinery with specific purpose and human beings left
grasping for meaning and an American defense budget that equals the
total income of Latin America and the Near East.

if you listened, you may come to ,the realization that all that
was said is more important to thine existence than all you may learn
in the classroom at the State University of New York at Albany.

Meadows quoted Dick Gregory as saying, ‘they are lying to us
twenty-four hours a day.l But i suspect that we believe even as our

mind sleeps. But aside from all that we are here to learn; I don't know
about anyone else but this type of ‘learning’ givesme a draft
deferment and this is as valid as any other reason for getting an
'education.‘ '

Can we perhaps learn anything from the University experience?
Yes, we do learn to be dishont with our professors. Yes, we do learn‘
to fear the grading system. Yes, We do learn to compete with our
fellow students. Are the professors more knowledgeable in their fields
than the student or are they more knowledgeable in society's games
and University rules? Ask a teacher to dwell on a point that strikes
your interest in the course, and he as
