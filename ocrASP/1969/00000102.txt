Joining Backus on defense will
be juniors Joel Volinsiri and Al

include seniors Lew Kshler and

Spring
by Bob Famiiant

Albany State had it's most
successful spring season as nine
varsity sports and one club
ﬁnished with winning records.

Lacrosse will become the 10th
varsity sport at State University at
Albany next spring. The stickmen
have earned the promotion after
5-0-1 and 9:1 seasons as a club.
Joe Silvey and John Morgan, both
part-time coaches, did a superb
job In conditioning and training
the players in a sport that made
its first appearance on campus last
year. Awards went to Mark
Werdcr (MVP); Bob Cole (most
improved); Steve Jakway
(Sportmanship); and Larry Smith
and Kevin Sheehan, (Captains
Leadership Award.) It looks like a
bright future for lacrosse at
Albany.

In its first year of varsity
competition the Albany track

team finished with a winning
record. The Great Danes won two
and lost one in dual meets, had
two ﬁrsts and two thirds in
triangulars, and tied for sixth at
the LeMoyne Relays. Don Beevers
was named most valuable, Orville
Eacker most improved, and Don
Van Cleve Most Valuable
Freshman. The team is looking
forward to another successful
season this Spring.

The Albany golf team had its
ﬁrst successful season since 1965,
ﬁnishing 8-5. Marv Gertzberg was
named the teams Outstanding
Golfer and Tom Patterson the
Most Improved.

The shining star of the

successful Spring season was the
undefeated tennis team. Led by
senior Ron McDernott the team
posted a 10-0 record. With five of
six starters returning this Spring it
should be another good year for
Tennis in 1970.

State University at Albany's
eminently successful coach, Bob
Munsey, faces his toughest
schedule with a team already
crippled by key personnel losses.
The Great Danes, (58-8 under
Coach Munsey for eight seasons),
opened the present season against
The US. Coast Guard Academy
and Montclair State at a
double-dual meet at the Academy.

Missing from last year’s squad
are five of the top six runners.
This leaves Munsey with only two
returning lettermen to build a
winning record on. Great pressure
as a result will be put on juniors
Pat Gepfert of Colonic. No.2 last
year, and Jim Mastromarchi of
Albany (AHS). No. 5 before being
sidelined by illness at midseason.

Gepfert, a 5'8" mighty mite
and senior Tom Mills of Baldwin
were elected (co-captains by their
teammates. Mills has shown great
improvement after failing to win
his letter last year. Tom
transferred to Albany two years
ago from Hofstra.

Dennis Huckett a sophomore
from Hilton . is perhaps the
brightest spot on the Danes'
Horizon. He was unbeaten in
freshman dual meets in 1968.
Hackett and Gepfert figure to
battle it out for top position.

Paul Holmes of Colonic, a
numeral winner in freshman
cross-country and track and field
last year has shown real promise,
but has hobbled recently by an
ankle sprain.

Munsey will look for depth
include seniors Larry Franks of
Smyrna and Joe ingrassia of
Nanuet, and juniors Jonathan
Herbst of Oceanside, Bill Meehan
of Rochester, and Orville Eacker
of Dolgeville. None have lettered.

Under the new ECAC rule,
freshmen are eligible for varsity
this year. Summing up, Munsey
says, “We‘ll run a little scared this
year, but don‘t count us out yet."
Based on his imprermive record,
few figure to do so.

Highlighting the forthcoming
season will be the third annual
Albany Invitational on October
25, Homecoming at Albany. The
schedule includes six dual meets
and three double-duals in addition
to the Albany and LeMoyne
invitations.

New Coaches Prepare Frosh For

This Saturday when the Junior
Varsity Cross-Country squad
opens its season in the Hudson
Valley Invitational, it will have a
rough road ahead— in more ways
than one. The sixteen man squad,
composed mainly of runners with
little or no previous experience
will be competing against many
Junior College teams who’ve had
the benefit of one year’s running.
Added to this disadvantage is the
unusually late start of practice
—0ne to two weeks later than
