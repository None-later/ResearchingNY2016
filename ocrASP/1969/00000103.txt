Faculty Senate to admit

formed to discuss this proposal.
The committee called for interim
student membershiop on the
Senate while formal plans for
student participation could be
formed.

At the Faculty Senate meeting
of June 2, 1969 the issue was
deferred till the September
meeting. One side issue which
developed was whether
instructors, who are not
represented on the Senate, should
also be allowed membership.

The Executive Committee took
the June 2deterral.to the General
Faculty meeting of September 11.
A resolution was approved which
allowed for 33 student
representatives on Faculty Senate,
22 undergraduates and 11
graduates.

This brings the total
membership of the Senate to 100
(67 faculty and 33 students).
Also. a committee was formed to
consider the implications of a
university government.-

Central Council has approved a
resolution to have the 22
undergraduate representatives
chosen by a general election. At

present arrangements are being
made for the elections.
Applications are available at the
Campus Center information Desk
and must be returned to the SA
office room 346 by October 10th.

Harrasement

Over the weekend of Sept. 20,
Alumni Quad residents reported—
several incidents of herrassment
by teenage Albany residents.

On Saturday night, two
University freshmen riding a
motorcycle in the vicinity of the
downtown campus were accosted
by an unidentified youth who
sprayed something in the face of
one.

The student was taken by
University police to Albany
Medical Center where he was
treated and released.

Later that night, the driver of
the motorcycle and four other
students returned to the same area
and one of the group was jumped.
He was also treated at. Albany
Medical Center.

Two lesser incidents involving
local youths were reported on
Sunday night by University
students.

on October 15, 1969 students all over America will leave the
classroom, put down their books and go out to speak to their
countrymen about the war in Vietnam. They will go to the factories,
and to the shopping centers, to the ghettoes and to the suburbs, The
war on Vietnam thus shall resume on the campus. And, as been said
before, we have not yet begun to fight.

It is about time. We’ve been patient. All too patient. We
understandably allowed the death of Robert Kennedy and the
Chicago massacre-to deaden us. We sat out the Nixon-Humphrey
non-election, fearing that the worst was yet to come.

And we gave Richard Nixon a fair chance. He told us to speak
quietly, that his role in history was to be that of "peace-maker." And
so we silently endured the sickening spectacle of Laird going to the
Pentagon, Mitchell to Justice, and Strom Thurmond to the ultimate
power. Somehow we felt, Nixon would have to end this war. Any man
astute enough to become President after two consecutive defeats,
would not allow himself to be trapped and destroyed by following the
example of his predecessor.

We were wrong. Nixon has affirmed and reaffirmed his contention
that our “committment” in Vietnam is a noble one, and in fact that
our adventure there is “our finesthour." He will have withdrawn by
Dec. 15, 1969 sixty thousand troops, leaving behind some 450,000 to
struggle and die while Henry Cabot Lodge, rejected by our people in
1952, 1960 and 1964, labors in Paris to prove that he was right all
along.

The 13-52 raids continue. The search and destroy missions continue.
The war extends to Laos. President Thieu says that he will not accept
any form of Communist presence in South Vietnam and adds that he
is tiring of the “peace negotiations." And meanwhile five New

Yorkers a day die. Five kids from Brooklyn, Ringswn mm oaravui
who are guilty of no crime but misplncc faith in their government.

The war must end. We have already learned that genuine wars of
national liberation cannot be stopped by big power intervention. The
Americans won out in 1777, the lsraclis won three times, the
Algerians defeated the French in 1962, and the Biafruns ili’C, despite
the indifference of the “civilized world," able to hold off the
Anglo-Russo-Egyptian-backed Nigerians. The Vietnamese also will
prevail. Like the Biafrans and the lsrnclis, their back is to the wall.

Our job is to work to bring our fellow Americans home from
Vietnam. We owe this much to the 450,000, to ourselves, and to
history. The anti-war action of Oct. 15 needs the support of every
individual who supports the right of young Americans to life. All
those who oppose this war must participate.

Let no one say we are acting precipitously. Wc indulged ourselves
with our peaceful ineffective demonstrations all through 1966 and
1967. In 1968, we went out. and rang doorbells for a Senator from
New York and a Senator from Minnesota. We won every single
primary and, in the process, unseated a President of the United States.
Today it is as if Eugene McCarthy never stood up alone in New
Hampshire and as if Robert F. Kennedy never lived and died in the
anti-war'cnuae. On Oct. 15 all this will change.

Because next month we‘ll be back. Get out your blue-whitt-
McCarthy button, your black bordered Kennedy pin. Clean up your
old pacarda and get. out your well-worn walking shoes. On October 15,
we march.

movements have been sounding.
"Conceiving of themselves as
exploited sons," says sociologist
Lewis Feuer in a recent notable
study on the conflict of
generations, "they feel a kinship
with the deceived and exploited
of society as a whole. . .Every
student movement has cherished
memories of brothers whom their
fathers destroyed."

it is its though each new
generation, brought into being not
by the passage of time but by
major shifts in the structure of
society or by the tragic event of
war or civil strife, or by the
strident voices of sensitive and
outraged prophets of reform,
undergoes a de-bricfing
experience, a de-bricfing which
cuts them loose from the
traditional mission laid upon them
by an older generation and which
sets them out on their own
apparently new mission of
discovery and fulfillment. “We
must," said President John

Kennedy, “we must plough new
furrows in the sky," and thereby
be linked for rill time the
furrowsof the fr-ontiering West to

it is probably true that each
new generation tends to
exaggerate the uniqueness of its
experiences with the world.
Nonetheless, there are differences,
and they are probably differences
which will make a difference, now
as they have in the past.

One such difference which
characterizes this new generation
of rebels is the way in which
student and black movements
alike are seeking to unite in
pervasive mistrust of authority
with strong idealistic impulses. It
is not. new in America to distrust
and attack authority; but it is
novel to witness the angry attacks
on the legitimacy of authority,

Various Council members felt

in other matters, Council gave
its endorsement and support to
the work of the Vietnam War

participation in the nationwide

support of the faculty at the

by not penalizing the students

death. This is a generation born
and growing and grown to
adulthood amid the scenes of
death: Nazi genocide, the
American bombing of Japanese
cities, Vietnam mulnattbnapnd
haunting the whole scene, to
final, irrevocable death of man
himself residing in the nuclear
bomb and in nuclear deterrent
systems. “Our work," read the
1963 Port Huron statement of the
S.D.S., “our work is guided by the
sense that. we may be the last
generation in the experiment with
living." It would be a sad mistake
to regard this language as
bombast, as empty poetry. The
words echo Camus' famous
statement that other generations
have seen themselve as “charged
with remaking the world,” but
this one has a task “perhaps even
greater, for it consists in keeping
the world from destroying itself,"
For the young, through
television and cinema and the
printed page and music, the world
has become a total environment.
in this new total world there is for
them the brooding sense of
sumbolic death, perceived, as
psychiatrist Robert Lifion
recently pointed out, “in this
combination of formlessness and
totality, of the inadequacy of
existing forms and of
imprisonment within them." And
so with Camus‘ "rebel," a culture
hero of this generation, the
utterly necessary appeal is to “the
essence of being," a quest “not.
.for life, but. for reasons for
living." It is not surprising that
they are finding those reasons, not
in the familiar Cartesian litanies,
but in what is for an older
generation the unfamiliar
