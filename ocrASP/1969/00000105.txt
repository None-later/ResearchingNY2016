In response in Hie Henderson Act, passed by
the slate legislature of its past session. all public
and pricale universities in the state were required
to draw up a set of rules and regulations aimed at
prescrcing order on campus. The Trustees of the
STATE University of New York submitted the
following:

The Board of Trustees of the State Unlvorslty of New
York adopted the following rules and regulations
pertainan to the malntenance of public order on State
Unlverslty campuses. These rules and regulatlons arr

Rules and Regulations for Maintenance of Public
Order on Premises of State-Operated Institutions
of the State University of New York Adopted by
the Board of Trustees of State University on
June 18. 1969 and Amended by the Executive
Committee of the Board of Trustees on July 10,
1969.

1. Statement of Purpose. The following rules
are adopted in compliance with Section 6450 of
the Education Law and shall be filed with the
Commissioner of Education and Board of
Regents within ten days after adoption. Nothing
herein is intended, nor shall it be construed, to
limit or restrict the freedom of speech nor
peaceful assembly. Free inquiry and free

autonomy of the educational institution (and the
accompanying institutional responsibility for the
maintenance of order) is best suited to achieve
these objectives. These rules shall not be
construed to prevent or limit communication
between and among faculty, students and
administration, or to relieve the institution of its
special responsibility for self regulation in the
preservation of public order. Their purpose is not
to prevent or restrain controversy and dissent
but to prevent abuse of the rights of others and
to maintain that public order appropriate to a
college or university campus without which there
can bc no intellectual freedom and they shall be
interpreted and applied to that end.

2. Application of Rules. These rules shall
apply to any state-operated institution of the
State University for which separate rules
covering the same subjects have not been
adopted by the institution, approved and
adopted by the State University trustees and
filed with the Commissioner of Education and
Board of Regents. These rules shall further apply
to any such institution for which separate rules
have been or shall be so approved and filed as to
any matter not expressly provided for in such
separate rules; subject to this exception, these
rules are not intended to repeal, supersede,
amend or preclude any other rules relating to the
same subject matter adopted, approved, and filed
as above specified. The rules hereby adopted
shall govern the conduct of students faculty and

Wardrousingdecture complex
confront President Kuusisto

“I wish to see the war
in Vietnam end as quickly as
possible." --Dr. Allen Kuusisto,
responding to a request for his his
signature on a petition asking for
monetary support from Central
Council for the anti-war activities
coming up, went on to say that
although his sympathies lie with
the anti-war movement, he could
not sign the petition without first
studying the ‘ramifications.’

Beyond this, the Presidents
confercnnce this week dealt with
everything from white
'blackboards' with fantastic
flourescent lights which turn evil
into gook, to budget bearings and
housing woed.

Kuusisto, was confronted with
a large number of students who
questioned the value of the new
lecture complex with its many
technological ‘advances.’
Complaints were lodged against
the lecture rooms, which,
according to varied sources, were
either lacking microphones,
amplifiers, cords, or suitable
seating provisions; the colebruted
‘whitc boards, or white
blackboards' (as you wish) which
made it virtually impossible to see
from any vantage point and which
afforded many professors the
opportunity to use different
colored chalks and to double as
window lookers were also a sore
point brought out by many iratc
students.

Also mentioned were
audio-visual aids which didn't, and
movie projectors which couldn’t.

and better paid policemen on the

Some upperclassmcn may
remember that Mr. I‘ritz made the
same run two ycars ago - and lost
to his Democratic opponent by
837 voles. He pulled 35'35 of the
total vole,

Today, there are still no
Republican cnnnnillccmen in the
city of Albany but Fritz still
retains his optimism. He feels that
all he needs to win is to change
the minds of aboul five hundred
voters.

To accomplish this, F‘rit'l. is
making an appeal to SUNYA
students for aid in the form of
ringing doorbells, distributing
leaflets, and spreading the word to
Albany‘s active, able, and
enlightened citizenry.

Fritz describes his relationship
with University students as “very
good.“ “0n the whole, I got along
with cvvrybody," he commented,
“and I can sure use any hpr Ican
get."

Why is Fritz running? "My
opponent hasn'l done anylhing,"
he complains. “'l‘lu-rc‘vc been no
new programs to satisfy the
pcoplc...l think I can do better,
but give me u chance to prove
myself,"

He complains that there is no

vigor If elected. “Wc need

II‘ril'I. cites lhc furl lhal lu'
prescnlcd pelilions to the,
venerable Mayor Coming for a
traffic light at the corner of Quail
and Hudson Streets, and also
concerning a playground. Both
requests were turned down.

All in all, Dr. Kuusisto and
students present seemed to agree
that we were fortunate that the
complex was not yet finished and
therefore, we were not yet the
proud possessors of a white
elephant.

The question of Pass-fail came
up as the conference moved on to
a more serious mood. Dr.
Kuusisto indicated that the
pass-fail proposal that
Faculty-Senate was currently
considering included only the
present freshman class. He
indicated however, that the
possibility of Faculty-Senate

revamping the proposal if not
likely, at least conceivable.

The talk turned to housing as a
question was raised concerning
Indian Quadrangle. Dr. Kuusisto
noted that this was a ‘sore point'
as he admitted that the low-rises
on the quad would not be ready,
in January, as originally planned.
In fact, Kuusisto hinted that there
was a possibility that the quad
might not be ready even this
September. This was met by a
Greccian chorus of shrieks and
moans from various unhappy
freshmen forced to commute this
year- on a ‘temporary' basis, of
course.

catame complex

The closing of the local
frontier and the creation of a
direct cross-podium concourse are
two results of the opening of the
lecture center catacomb. This not
only adds 25 new lecture rooms
to an increasingly impressive
listing of facilities, but also
presents the student body with

assorted little rooms that

The actual lecture rooms are
definitely an improvement over

in the library basement and the
overAcrowded, poorly

Science building. They seemingly
will contribute immensely to an
increased efficiency in the
university's production of college
graduates.

Students are first aware of the
duo-swivcl-and-swing chairs
featured in most of the lecture
rooms that enable you to actually
enjoy a boring math lecture.

Many of the senators referred

to the proposed system as a

to these statements, endorsed the
proposal as a beginning, and
denounced any grades at all as

ll was felt. that [he vote should
wail until the student
representatives wcrc elected. It
was mentioned thul the October
‘20 meeting might be postponed
until the 27 so as to allow for
student discussion and vote.

Anolhcr topic of discussion at
the meeting was the faculty
position on the boycott

enough for any non-machanical
Ph, D. to operate with an
appropriate paper clip.

Florescent lights will eventually
top the white chalk boards. TheSe
lights will pick up florescent
particles in the colored chalk so
that the writing can supposedly be
seen without squinting and
squirming.

A damp sponge is, in theory,
the only equipment necessary to
wipe off the chalk boards.
However, according to Mr.
Tisdale, Assistant to the President
for Planning and Development,
“there are problems involved and
the administration is aware of
these." This type of chalk board
was endorsed by the RPI
Experimental Teaching
Laboratory and has been used
successfully at other schools.

Student frustration because of
non-functioning or poorly
functioning audio and video
equipment will be lessened as the
teaching staff and technicians
become more familiar with the
cquipmcnt‘s operation. However,
until this Utopia arrives students
are suffering through classes
without microphones, or
amplifiers, or perhaps a
microphone with a 2-fool cord
that tends to choke the professor.

With the completion of the
lecture room center, the existing
Academic l’odiumcxccpt for some
minor landscaping, is finally
finished. However by 1975 two
extensive podium additions will
be constructed. For all students

official disposition was stated as
being a matter of choice for both
students and faculty. It was hoped
that faculty would not penalize
students for boycotting class.
