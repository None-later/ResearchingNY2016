THE DANES will play Oneonata Wednesday at 4:00 PM.

by Mark Grand

Albany State‘s soccer team
came from behind to tie the tough
Coast Guard Academy, 2-2, in a
game held at the opponent‘s field
Saturday.

George Keteshian. a freshman
from Albany High, scored the
team‘s first goal in the third
period. tying the game up at one
apiece. Co-captain Jim Shear, the
Dane‘s leading scorer last year,
took a pass from Steve Backus,
the fine freshman fullback. and
booted in Albany’s second tally of
the game. That goal came late in
the fourth period, knotting the

 

game at two.

The playing field at- the Coast'

Guard Academy was ten yards
narrower than regulation size, a
factor that Coach Schieffelin feels
deﬁnitely hampered the play of
his team.

The Coast Guard game
uncovered many favorable signs.
The. most impressive is the fact
that Albany tied a team whose
schedule includes several schools
from downstate, such as NYU, a
national soccer power.

Coach Schieffclin is very
pleased with the team’s
performance so far and is very
optimistic about its future. He

notes several reasons for such
optimism, among them the
outstanding play of the three
starting freshmen, Backus,
Keleshian and goalie John Thayer.
Demetrius Michael, a transfer
student from Ulster Community
College, should bolster the attack
which in the past has not
produced the necessary scoring
punch desired by Schieffelin.
Coach Schieffelin describes the
team as “much stronger than last
year, regardless of its record."
The Danes tackle Oneonta
tomorrow and Albany will be
looking to avenge the 7-0 beating
Oneonta handed them last year.

Frosh CC

The Albany State junior
varsity cross country team
traveled to Hudson Valley
Community College this past
Saturday for the seventh annual
HVCC Invitational Meet.

State was for all intents and
purposes, the only freshman
contingent competing (actually,
the team is a junior varsity squad
but is comprised solely of
freshmen). The remaining schools
were all junior colleges who were
represented by runners who have
had a year's valuable experience.

This was the first meet, so
considering the fact that the team
had little time to practice (a mere
two weeks of conditioning) the
baby Danes did very well in
finishing nineteenth out of the
twenty-five teams entered.

SUC at Cobleskill won the meet
for the third year in succession as
three of their runners filled the
top three places. Albany‘s John
Comerford finished in the
fifty-fifth position out of the 215
starters. John Stanton was the
second State runner to finish,

running. The program meets nany,
Monday thru Thursday from 3:30
to 4:30 p.m. Those interested
should report to the third floor of
the PE. building.

The university will sponsor a
basketball coaching clinic for area
high school coaches November 2.
from 2-5 p.m., in the university
gymnasium. Albany head coach
Dick Sauers, varsity assistant Mike
O'Brien, and freshman coach Bob
Lewis will conduct the program.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Hackett,Gepfert Star

by Dave Pink
The Albany State varsity
crosscountry team will be hard
pressed to better last year's 8-2
won-lost slate but. one can rest
assured that they are trying.
Suffering from a definite lack
of depth, the Danes managed to
manhandle both Potsdam and
Plattsburgh State this past
Saturday in a triangular meet.

Obviously the fact that
conditions were the finest possible
were a prime factor for very fine
early season times. Sophomore
Dennis Hacket, the sensation of
last year’s freshman contingent
and captain Pat Gepfert crossed
the finish line in a tie for first
place in a time which exceeded
the five mile course record by
only a little over two and one half
minutes.

Three other runners were also
singled out by Coach Munsey for
additional praise. Tom Mills, who
finished fifth behind Hackett,
Gepfert and two Potsdam
Harriers, bettered his best
previous time on the course by
over a minute. At the same time,
both Orville Eacker and Larry
Franks who finished eighth and
ninth respectively, each slashed
twenty seconds off their previous
best times. Due to this
outstanding performance Eacker
was awarded the highly coveted
title of “runner of the meet."

This Saturday, the team travels
to Syracuse for the LeMoyne
Invitationals. Last year, State
ﬁnished a respectable fifth out of
ﬁfteen teams competing. Coach
Munsey sees the team’s chances as

As Harriers Win Big

being moderately good. He
expects the stiffest competition
form SUC Cortland, Buffalo
State, Roberts Wesleyan and the
host team, LcMoync.

95 Better Than UCLA

In last April 3‘s issue of the Knickerbocker News a reader asked, “If
the Albany basketball team lost to Wagner in the NCAA Eastern
Regional Tournament 109-64 and then the next night Wagner was
wrecked by Montclair State 101-78, then where does that leave the
basketball played in this area?" After some deliberation, the sports
columnist answered with a chain reaction of scores researched by an
Albany student.

Albany defeated LcMoyne 71-70, thus Albany was 1 point better
than LcMoync.

LCMoync defeated St. Peters ill-80, thus Albany was 2 points
better than St. Peters.

St. Peters defeated Manhattcn 78-76, thus Albany was 4 points
better Manhattcn.

Manhattcn defeated Canisius 75-72, thus Albany was 7 points
better than Canisius.

Canisius defeated Xavier 76-66, thus Albany was 17 points better
than Xavier.

szicr defeated Dayton 59-55, thus Albany was 21 points better
than Dayton.

Dayton defeated Detroit 6462. thus Albany was 23 points better
than Detroit.

Detroit defeated St. Bonaventure 7I68, thus Albany was 26 points
better than St. Bonaventure.

St. Bonaventure defeated Marquette 8462, thus Albany was 48
points better than Marquette.

Marquette defeated Loyola (ii-So, tints Albany was 53 points
better than Loyola.

Loyola defeated Colorado State 75-64, thus Albany was ()4 points
better than Colorado State.

Colorado State defeated Wyoming 78-68, thus Albany was 74
points better than Wyoming.

Wyoming defeated Brigham Young 7969, thus Albany was 84
points better than Brigham Young.

Brigham Young defeated USC 95-86, thus Albany was 93 points
better than USC.

USC defeated UCLA 46-44, thus Albany was 95 points better than
UCLA.

When queried about what one could expect if State did indeed step
onto the court with Low Alcindor-Iod UCLA, Coach “Doc” Sauers
stated “I would hope they missed their ﬁrst shot so we could get the
ball and freeze it. This is assuming that they won the opening tapoff,

 

places recorded by skippers Jon
Sargalis, Glenn Faden, and
Richard Alweis, but a series of
unfortunate disqualifications put

Marish ahead; the final score was
Marist 56, Albany 51, and Queens
36. Also skippering for Albany
were Marg Straube and Chris
Follows. Bruce Fullem, Kris
Healy, and Brian Hennesey
crowed.

Next weekend the team travels
to Cornell to compete in the
Upper New York State Area
Championships.

KB Dorms Porter;
APA,STB Scoreless

by Mike Schwekcrt

A.M.I.A. Division I football
started off its season with a
bone-crushing crunch last
Saturday with six of its ten teams
in action. The accent was
definitely on defense with only
two touchdowns beign scored in
the three games, and more
defensive backs than offensive
ends catching passes—or so it must
have seemed to the quarterbacks.
Two players, Potter’s Russ
Wienlien and UPS’ Joe Nicollella,
each pulled down three
interceptions, while five other
players pulled down one each. All
in all, it was a great day for
defense.

In a fiercely contested game,
defending champion APA played
runner-up STB to a scoreless tie.
The strongpoint for‘APA's offense
was the tremendous punting of
Bob Fairbnsh which kept STB
from capitalizing on their erratic
offensive's inability to move the
ball. The same can be said for
STB's Tom Sears’ booming punts.

In another close encounter,
UPS defeated TXO 6-0. The score
came on a screen pass to Van
Erera, who after receiving the ball

flipped the TD pass to the left

VVhy

end, Patterson, who had slipped
behind the usually alert TXO

defenders. Both teams showed
of offense, but aside from the
score neither was ableto sustain a
drive.

In the third game, KB squeaked
to a 6-0 decision over Potter. KB
scored on a three yard run by Al
Nuhresbury and then, with the
help of a disputed call, managed
to hold off Potter for the victory.
With under two minutes left,
Potter QB Pete Monti completed a
pass in the endzone, but the
official ruled that defensive pass
interference had taken place
before the reception, thus
nulifying the play. However,
Potter was awarded the ball on
the one yard line. But KB held
firm on four succecsive running
plays and preserved the win.

Three games are scheduled for

.this week: STB vs. Johnson on

Monday, APA vs. KB on Tuesday,
and EEP vs. UPS on Thursday.
