Report on pass-fail

continued from page 1
Committee studied the question
through most of 1968/69,
investigating a number of plans
for change. They canvassed
faculty opinion on this campus
and others. including directors of
graduate schools. On May 26 the
Committee recommended in a
five-page report to the
Undergraduate Academic Council
a ‘mixed‘ H-S-U system, to which

the Council added a
recommendation for field.
examinations. It was this plan

which the Senate was finally
unwilling to adopt at the end of
the year. Still. the year‘s work
amounted to a virtual “ ‘ for
change.

It is clear that during 1968/69 a
great deal of attention was given
to the grading problem by many
members of the University
community. and valuable reports
had resulted. The summer ad hoc
Committee on grading was
expected to work primarily from
these reports and supporting
documents. not to look for fresh
data unless it was clearly useful
and readily acquired-I to develop
recommendations for the Senate
to act upon'I and to furnish thv
necessary information and
rationale.

ll. PROPOSAL

Boginning in the fall term. 1969.
all grades for freshmen students
be submitted to the Registrar as
satisfactory or no-credit.
work is that quality of academic
performance which the institution
expects from its students in order
to earn an undergraduate degree.
The mark of no-credit means that
a student has not provided the
instructor with evidence which
would justify the grade of
satisfactory.

Beginning in the fall term, 1970.
such grading shall be used for all
. L an ..

r ":5.

The new grading system shall be
under continuing observation and
review by the Academic Standing
Committee of the Undergraduate
Academic Council. which shall
interpret the system. report on its
operation. and recommend
changes as appropriate .

The system shall be in effect until
June. 1978.

Editor's note: the remaining
three sections of the report will
appear in subsequent issues of the

paper.

Refrigerator rentals

initiated at

by Dave Peck

"Rent a refrigerator [or $45?
For that price I could hire a
cook!”

These were typical reactions to
the news that this year. for the
ﬁrst time ever, University students
would be allowed to rent a
refrigerator. Over 300 units have
been installed. which means that
about 1500 students will be using
one in their suite. The
refrigerators are manuafacturcd
by Norcold Inc. of Ohio.

In the past. students were not
allowed to keep refrigerators in
their room. This was accuusc
many of the units were old and
had dangerous wiring or used

SUN YA

ozone gas. a poison. Because so
many students wanted
refrigerators the administration
and representatives of the student
body designed this new policy.
The cost of renting a Norcold is
$45 plus $15 deposit which is

refunded when the unit is
returned in "satisfactory"
condition. The $45 provides

$4.50 for electricity. $1 for the
administrative charge of records.
contract printing. etc. $3 for
delivery. repairs and cleaning. and
$36.50 to Norcold. If you would
like to rent a unit contact the
On-Campus Housing Office
located in Fulton Hall.

Appropriation

continued from page I

itself and this University to
substantial liability in the event of
serious injury or death of students
participating in the protest march.

In conclusion, be specifically
stated: “I feel that the suggested
use of Association funds (for
renting the buses) would be
improper and illegal.

Mr. Kimberly supporting the
contention that the trip would be
illegal, quoted Section 302.14 of
the Rules and Regulations of the
State of New York: "Munditory
student activity fees for the
support of programs of an
educational cultural. recreational.
and social nature may be
approved by an organization duly
elected by and representative of
the axudent body." In this
statemx at there is no mention of
use of student tax funds for
religious. moral, or political
purposes.

Bob Iseman brought up the
principle that the bill for the
appropriation might be in conflict
with a section of the blest of
the Student Association that
states that political groups on
campus cannot be funded with
student tax money. The chair
ruled against this interpretation
and left further action on it up to
the discretion of the Supreme
Court.

ballot. The polls were then closed
immediately. handwritten signs
were then made and posted in the
lobby stating that polls were
closed and that all those who had
voted between 10 and 10:25
would have to vote again and Miss
Buchaltcr a member of Student
Activities Staff was informed.
After confirming that the name
was omitted a new stencil was
made up in Mr. Brown’s office
which included the omitted name.

Attempts were made to inform
’the student body of the need to
revote in the following ways: a
memo was sent to all directors
and resedent assistants to ask that
they inform the people in their
dormitories; and posters were
hung on the podium, quadrangles
and in the Campus Center

open from 5-6 on Wednesday and
Thursday nights.

All absentee ballots sent to

Student radical struggles—F

through mayoral campaign

by Neill Shanahan

The problems of a student
radical engaged in “big time"
politics were made clear Tuesday
as Bill O'Kain, Young Socialist

Alliance candidate for mayor.
discussed his campaign.
“The big parties ignore me

except when I confront them face
to face."

Saturday. Sept 28 at a campus
center appearance by Albert
Hartheimer. Bill O'Kain
confronted his Republican
opponent. O‘Kain's challenge for
a face-to-face debate was turned
down. Similar notes to Mayor
Corning have gone unanswered.

O‘Kain. while ignored
publically. claims he has hardly
been left to his own privately.

“We’ve had some harassment
by the Board of Elections and
Police," he said cooly.

"The police came to our
apartment twice at 7:00 am.
Once they told my roommate he
could vote. and the next time
they told him he couldn't."

“Repeatedly my mail has been
opened." he said. “When it first
started happening in 1965, l was
corresponding with SDS. It has
continued to the point that
manilla folders from the YSA
Office in New York have now
come with the tape ripped apart.
Our organization has been
harassed throughout the United
States."

O'Kain was referring to the
YOung Socialist Alliance. the
youth organization allied with
The Socialist Workers Party and
with other socialist groups around

Alumni Quad supports

antiwar protest move

by Nancy Zollus

The pulsing issue of the
Vietnam War found itself at
Alumni Quad Wednesday night.
About 75 residents met to discuss
the October 15 moratorium and
the November l5 March on
Washington. They discussed the
most effective way they could
make both events suCcoss’ful.

The downtown campus finds
itself separated from the Inain
campus both geographically and
spitiluully. Consequently Alumni

Quad residents feel they could
work separately but in
conjunction with similar uptown
organizations.

linth the Moratorium and the
March on Washington. nationally
supported. are being promoted by

several Albany groups.
Coordinating the SUNYA IIan
nationwide campus movements

has l)t‘l‘l| the Student Mobilization
Committee.
Michael Avon. originator of the

Alumni Quad meeting. was quick
to inform the residents that this
movement is not a political one
but a moral one. He told the
students. “As long as you can't
stand killing you belong here."
Mark Bergman. another Alumni
Quad resident. explained that the
conceived plan of the Moratorium
originators was to sot aside one
day in October. iwn in November.
and continue progressively until
the Vietnam War was over. The
plan envisions that on these days
the students would stay away
from classes and workers would
stay away from jobs. and use the
day informing city residents of

their position concerning this
‘immornl' war.
The SUNYA Faculty SI-nalv

has left the decision whether to
hold Classes on October 15 up to
the discretion of each instructor.

Ilcyond the Moratorium. the
Alumni Quad expects to be It part
of the November 15 March.

the world.

Born in Philadelphia. O’Kain is
a 1968 transfer from Villanova.
As a major in economics, he
became dissatisfied with the
hourgeors’ ’ economics that they
teach you in school." Undecided
whether to turn to the right wing
or left. he undertook a diverse
reading program that included
both William Buckley and Karl
Marx. In time be identified most
with Trotsky. and now describes
himself and the party as
Trotskyist.

O'Kain paints the political and
social scene in Albany as “very
bad, very poor.“

“The Albany machine is not
quite as subtle as other cities and
the courts are racist--remember
Sam McDowell."

Sam McDowell is a black who
was sentencedto three years in jail
for allegedly assaulting a police
office--many claim after racial
slurs were hurled at him by the
police.)

"The South Mall project." he
continues. “is unjust. It's a
multi-million dollar complex
going up right next to a slum.
Many people lost their
homes-when it should he FOR the
people. And the planning has been
stupid too -- the Motor Vehicle
Building will not be big enough to
hold all the offices that it should.

O'Kain pointed out that
off—campus Albany State students
also hear the brunt of the city's
iniquitics.

"Students pay exorbitant rents
mostly for poor living conditions.
You have to pay up your ass for a
decent apartment."

But the concerns of the
candidate and the party go
beyond the immediate campaign.
O'Kain spends much of his free
time in the Campus Center lobby
soliciting support for the Student
Mobilization against the War.

Moreover. he sees the war: as
something “America has to do -
chase around the world for
markets and cheap labor." He
continued.“ you find this in every
capitalist society. exploitation and
imperialist war."

O‘Kain pointed out that the
University maintains connections
with the defense establishemtn
that is conducting the war.

"Albany State has a contract
with the Department of Defense
for ROTSY. We don't know how
much money is involved and it is
impossible to tell the implications
because nobody talks, nobody
comes out and say what is
happening. You've got to dig."

The Socialist candidate

indicated that he will continue to
dig for a long time to come.

“As of right now.there‘s “0 end
to the struggle. Radical politics
will involve quite a bit of my
life." he promised.

Goodell advocates reforms

continued from page I

World.

As parts of a solution to these
problems. revenue sharing (for
localities). federal assumption of
most of the welfare burden. and
less strict marijuana laws were
among his suggestions. The
senator stated that reform of our
narcotics programs and
rehabilitation of addicts should be
among our highest priorities.

Senator Goodell. (who was
appointed to fill the vacancy left
by Robert Kennedy's
assasination). will be seeking
re-election to the U.S. Senate in
1970. His independent positions
(including support of Mayor
Lindsay over Republican
candidate Marchi) have somewhat
alienated Nixon. Governor
Rockefeller and many other
Republicans.
