,Ed'snate: this is a
continuation of last issues attempt
to describe the exciting new
pass-fail proposal now before
Senate.

_ Ill. PROPOSAL CLARIFICATION -

Symbols. The term ‘all freshman
grades’ refers to grades formerly
recorded as A,B,C,D, and E: the
proposal is not intended to affect
is now ‘awarded in graduate
seminars, student teaching, and
other approved courses’
(Undergrauuate Bulletin, 1969-70,
pg. 59). The proposal would
extend such approval while
preserving the meaning of the
term and the convenience of a
symboi that is an initial letter.
The symbol N would avoid the
pejorative and often misleading
implications of

(‘unsatisfactory‘) or F(‘failed’)',
however, it may be unacceptable
as a symbol, because it now
signifies that a course was offered
on a non- credit basis. Perhaps NC

pro osal

en ate

could be used, or X, but the
choice of the most ' ‘
symbols can be determined by the
Registrar in consultation with the
Academic Standing Committee.

Duration of experiment. Four
ears provides time for the
,novelty of the plan to wear off
and for students, faculty, and
administration to have gained
lsubstantial experience with it.
.During the third year the first
freshmen under the plan would
be juniors, well into their major
ﬁelds and with good perspective
on their experience.

Starting Date. The policy should
begin without delay. The matter'
has been long and responsibly
deliberated, there is a strong
consensus among students, and
there are no major administrative
impediments. We can think of no
consideration that would require
or justify wainting any longer.

Very simple. You take NoDoz all at

the recommended dosage, you get twice
the caffeine in a cup of coffee.

Two tablets—isn't that likely to be

completely non-habit forming.

New Youth Movement claims
more direction than SDS

by Vicki Zelden

“Reactivatc the anti-war
sentiment in this country. Relate
to the working class. Tell them
about the “blood tax” and the
“mind tax" being levied against
them through their children.”
This in essence is the goal of
R.Y.M. ll (Revolutionary Youth
Movement).

R.Y.M. II, which is an offshoot
of the Students for a Dcmocratic
Society, claims to have a more
directed program than S.D.S.
Their aim is to mobilize the youth
in schools, the armed forces and
factories ngainsl U.S. imperialism
and exploitation and to support
demands of blacks and browns.
They also claim not to be as
militant as T.Y.M. I which is
headed by Mark Rudd.

The main thrust of the Oct.
2nd meeting was to give the
details of the plan of action for
the Oct 8-1 I demonstrations to be
held in Chicago. The goal is to
show the working people how the
war is adversely affecting them.

On Wednesday, Oct. 8, there
will be street rallies throughout
working class communities,
leztfleting at plant gates, small
disciplined demonstrations at
draft boards, tttx offices and in
support of welfare mothers, the
Black Panther Party Breakfast
Program and Young Lords
(Mexican Americans and Pucrto
Rican Americans) Organization
Day Care Center.

Thursday, Oct. 9 there will be

boycotts in the morning and a
march on the board of education.
They want to show that youth
reject the jail-like education which
teaches them to oppress the
people and not to serve them.

In the afternoon 'hcrc will be a
major rally at the International
Harvester Plant. This plant is
closing down in Chicago, leaving
thousands unemployed to open a
new plant in Vietnam because
labor is cheaper.

On Friday, OLL 10, the main
action will be a major hospital

Kennedy on law & order

by Chris Masterson

Joseph L. Kennedy Jr.
delivered a rather short, subdued
speech concerning law and order
and his campaign as the
Conservative Candidate for
Albany mayor to a small group of
students Thursday averting.

Kennedy declared it. necessary
that the 28-year reign of
incumbent mayor Corning end
and not be replaced with the
political machine the Republicans
might bring with them. Corning's
administration it was claimed,
distinguished itself only through
doling out “no-show jobs," five
dollar bills at the clction polls and
various other useful favors.

Mr, Kennedy‘s prepared speech,
containing an actual policy
statement, cmtr‘crncd law and
order not as an instruman of
suppression, but as an instrument
of ordinary protection needed by

practiced on working class
mothers in these hospitals.

Saturday at. 2 p.m., the main
march will start deep in the
oppressed communities of the
north side. The theme of the
march is solidarity with the
Vietnamese people - U.S. get. out
of Vietnam now.

R.Y.M. II advises those
planning to attend the Chicago
action to travel in groups and have
some money for bail. They say
that it. would be easier to take a
bus than a car since any car with
an out of state license can legally
be delayed to be checked.

In closing the speakers
emphasized the fact that all
brothers and sisters must stick
together and act in a disciplined
manner whenever possible. They
stressed though, that if the “pigs”
want trouble they'll get it.

Albany citizens. In order to
eliminate the “unprecedented
lawlessness" of Albany, Kennedy
proposes the following to restore
people's confidence in their police
and government:

l) Increase of the Albany
police force by 50%, bringing the
total to 300 men.

2) Use of foot patrolmen
equipped with walkie tnlkies
during "pri me crime" hours

3) Institution of a “canine
corps" to aid the foot patrolman.

4) Establishment. of a direct
dialing system to contact. police in
an emergency through use of
ll-digit telephone number.

Even at age 24, Kennedy does
not offer any “Impossible
Dream," but what he feels to be
practical solutions to real
problems.

Kuusigp

anti-war

Acting President Allan Kuisisto
admitted at his conference with
students that the actual legality of
the funding of buses to
Washington by Central Council
was, at best, a question without a
set answer.

He went on to state that it.
would be quite hard to determine
whether or not the action of
Council was a valid one.

However, Dr. Kuisisto stated,
unless definite action was taken to
restrain the movement, Kuisisto
said be imagined that the wishes
of students (as shown by the 2700
signatures on the petitions and
Council's action) would be carried
out.

He also reiterated his stand on
the Vietnam moratorium stating
that his personal sympathies lie
with the move to end the war, but
that he would make no move to
close the University on October
15. The reason given for this was
that “all students who wish to go
to classes should not be denied
that opportunity."

However, Kuisisto again stated
that he would make an effort to
ask faculty not. to hold
examinations or penalize students
who are absent that day.

In other matters, the President
briefly mentioned that there is no
ROTC program on this campus.
He stated that no monies are
received from the Defense
Department for any ROTC
students, even though there is a
working agreement with Union
College which allows interested
SUNYA students to take ROTC
there.

Another issue clarified at. the

buses

conference dealt with the
question of the Bookstore‘s policy
of charging sales tax on books and
materials.

"Since the bookstore (FSA) is a
non-profit organization and
non-profit organizations are
exempt from sales tax, why then
do we pay tax at the bookstore"
as the nature of the query posed.

Dr. Clifton C. Thorne, Vice
President for Academic Affairs,
explained that the belief that all
non-profit organizations are tax
exempt. He went on to explain
that FSA in earlier days, did not
pay tax, but was later sued for the
money and after it discovered that
it had to, indeed, pay taxes.

Other topics brought up at the
conference included further
discussion on the lecture complex
and its incredibly inappropriate
white chalkboards, and the

" question of adding additional
buses to the University ﬂeet.

The President's Conference is
held at 2:15 p.m. every Monday
in the Patroon Lounge on the first
floor of the Campus Center. All
students are invited.
