Malcolm X

Continued from page 3

separately, “You do your thing,
and we’ll do ours." He told them
to work toward common goals
but counciled: “Don‘t join
me--I’m nervous around while
people."

Holiday touched only briefly
on his early life—how he became
involved with a militant black
organization in Harlem, how tho
organization split and how
Malcolm met with the members.
From there, Mr. Holiday followed
Malcolm into the Nation of Islam,
left it when Malcolm bccami-
dissatisfied and helped form .1
separate organization with him.

Holiday was adamant in his
belief that Malcolm was a victim
of a CIA. plot. He said it was
obvious that Elijah Muhammad's
Muslim group was heavily
infiltrated with C,I,A., FBI and
Ku Klux Klan agents. “Malcolm
trusted us--he trusted us too
much," he told his audience. llt‘
didn’t believe a black man would
ever be bought out.”

Black unity, revolution, KKK;
among ‘Myths of Malcom’

by Al Senia

“The NAACP is a social club!
Black preachers are legalized
pimps! They're robbing their
brothers in the Lord's name, This
is what is plaguing our race today,
This is what is plaguing our
people today! Our real problem is
inside-within our own bowels. We
gol. to get these niggers together
and stop this kind of foolishness.
You achieve things only when
you‘re together!"

So slioki' Mr. lloruco lloliduV.
as ho Slautl in front of twu livoly
audiences Iasl Wednesday. He was
:i [\L‘rsunul bodyguard of thc Iale
Malcolm X. Mr. Holiday spoke
twice on lllt' “Myths of Malcolm
X"»-oncc ul :IIIII inl. and again
ill 7 :00 p.m.

Holiday decried the split within
the block man's ranks in America

complete agreement with most of

them. “Together, we
divided Wc full!"

He then explained unity in
terms of a "black civil war." He
continued: "A black civil war is
getting our people together. Then,
after unification, we raise our
flag,"

Holiday also complained that
“there are black leaders in top
positions that. black people didn't

cleaned out." As far as the
American political spectrum is
concur-nod, M r. Holiday
cmphnsiznd the black man's place
in it was “nol.hing"---“wc have no
plilL‘i' in it." He chided black
politicians such as Carl Stokes and
Edward Brooke as “Uncle Toms"
:ind "flunkics."

He made it 2i point. to assure his
audiences, which were composed
of a large number of both black
and while students, that he was
not anti-white, “The problem is
not with the white people, it's
with those who take advantage of
your own kind," he told them.
