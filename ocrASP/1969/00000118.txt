I saw the Doors at the
Saratoga Performing Arts
Center in the summer of ‘68.
SPAC officials had apparently
given Jim Morrison the word to
abstain from his “obscene
writhing" and abolish a good
share of his between-the-song
commentary in hopes of
“cleaning it up" for the Spa‘s
sophisticated reputation.

(In keeping with this policy,
they also made Janis Joplin
guzzle her Southern Comfort
from a neutral-looking paper
cup).

But, as with Janis, Morrison's
passion could not be stifled.
There he was on the floor in
beautiful contortions with
Manzarek, Densmore and
Kreiger giving him; support
from their respective positions
at the organ, drums and guitar.

The “episode” in Miami is

further proof of Morrison's
powar. His masturbation was
not performed alone but by the
hysterical mob as well.
Morrison made them beg for it.

The Doors‘ album, “The Soft
Parade," is yet another proof of
their force. Several
sclections--"Tell All the
People," “Touch Me," "Wild
Child," “Runnin’ Blue,"
“Wishful Sinfull"--have made it
on their own.

“Touch Me" and “Runnin’
Blue” are superior, musically
speaking. Poetically, I find it
impossible to discriminate any
single one as “the best” since
each is just as beautiful as the
next. You don’t even have to
listen to them to appreciate
them. Just reading these poems
of Jim Morrison and/or Robbie
Kreiger, you are hit by a

“Golden Eye” emphasis

on folk music, theater

The “Golden Eye," an
off-campus coffee-house for
students and faculty, will open its
new season Friday night. The
program will be a collage of
student folk talent, Popular
performers will include “Golden

staggering impact. How can
anyone fail to feel a deep
bewilderment at the lines,
“When all else fails, We can
whip the horses’ eyes, And
make them sleep, And cry..."
which is the spoken conclusion
of “The Soft Parade."

The only disappointment on
the album is “Easy Ride." The
melody is out. of place. It seems
like carnival music and is not
sophisticated enough for the
sensitive lyrics. (“...Joy fought
vaguely, With your pride... Like
polished stone..,I see your eyes.
Like burning glass... I hear you

On the other hand, the title
song is flawless. It is an entire
trip--a parade of prismatic
images held together by
Morrison's rejection of God and
disillusionment with society.

He starts out like a Holy
Roller at a Revival meeting, but
his message is antithetical to
this setting. I-lc finiilly explodes
with the scornful revelation
"You CANNOT petition the
Lord with prayer!" His derision
is further amplified later in the
song by the transition of the
word "dogs" to "gods."

of emotion contains a note of
hope. (“This is the best part of

Young pianist
here tonight

by Warren Burt

Paul Jacobs, one of the most
brilliant young interpreters of the
piano music of the Twentieth
century, will appear in concert
tonight at 8:30 in the Main
Theatre of the Performing Arts
Center.

Mr. Jacobs, wao lived for nine
years in Paris, where he became a
champion of the music of Pierre
Boulez and Karlheinz
Stockhausen, from all the piano
literature of this century, but has
a special affinity for French music
from the early part of the
century. His program tonight,
“Paris Music," reflects that taste.
Works being performed will
include the Debussey Preludes
Book 2, the rave] Valses Nobles at
Sentimentales, and a group of
Straviinsky pieces, including the
Piano Rag Music and the Sonata
for Piano.

He has recorded extensively, his
most recent and unusual recording
being that of harpsichord soloist
in Elliott Carter's Double
Concerto on Colitmbia Records.
Currently, he is pianist with thc‘
New York Philharmonic, and is on

the faculty of the Manhattan
School of music

Telethon beneﬁts

depri ed
by Barbara Bernstein

Two years ago a student at
Albany State had an idea. When
he discuged it with some other
people, they thought he was
crazy. But with considerable
thought and discussion the idea

appeared more and more
probable. Many months of
planning went into the first

Telethon which took place in
March of 1967. Proceeds from the
first Telethon wont to the Mental
Health Association.

The organizers of Telethon saw
it as a “lesson in life, not just
studying." Their objectives were

to benefit Mental Health and to
“demonstrate to the surrounding
community that the University is
capable of undertaking such a
large project and hopefully, with
success."

Albany State was the first
college to put on a telethon.
Although it was impossible to
have local television coverage that
year, it was hoped that future

telethons could be locally
televised.
Last November, Telethon

culminated a week of events
known as Campus Chest. Proceeds
from this Telethon went to the
Student Mental Health
Work-Study Interne Project, a
program which employs students
from area collegs to work as aides
and assistants in various capacities
connected with the mentally ill.
Money also went for materials for
tutoring in the poorer sections of
Albany. One of the highlights of
this Telethon was a half hour of
local television coverage.

This year’s Telethon will take
place on November 14. It will run

from 7 pm. Friday night,
November 14 until 7 p.m.
Saturday night, November 15.
Proceeds will go to Albany
