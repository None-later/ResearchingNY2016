Boaters lose bout to RPI

by Robert Familant

Hard luck continued to beset
the State hooters as they were
defeated by RPI Wednesday 5-0.

The Great Danes played a
superior Engineer team to a
scoreless first period. However, at
the eighteen minute mark, tragedy
struck. Freshman goalie John
Thayer who already had many
fine saves, fractured two ribs in a
collision with the Engineers

outstanding forward
'I‘racktenberg, after having made a
great save on his attempted goal.
Thayer will be out for the rest of
the season, a crushing blow to a
team hoping to improve its record
of 0-3-1. He was replaced by
Junior goalie Terry Jordan, last
year’s starter at that position.
Jordan did a fine job filling in the
rest of the game.

The momentum then changed
hands and RPI took over. Led by
their outstanding forwards,

Conroy and 'I‘racktenberg, and
helped by two penalty kicks
converted into goals, the
Engineers took a 3-0 lead at
half-time. They scored once more
in the third and again in the final
quarter.

Cited for their fine play by
Coach Bill Schiefflin were
freshman Steve Backus and Junior
Joel Volinski. The team is hopeful
of breaking into the win column
this Saturday against Central
Connecticut.

Harriers second in Triangular

The Albany State barriers
traveled to Troy last Wednesday
to compete against RPI and Siena
in a triangular meet.

Albany State with fine efforts
by the always reliable Pat Gepfert
and Dennis Hackett, who finished
second and third respectively, led
the Harriers to a second place
ﬁnish behind an extremely strong
RPI team. William Pollock,
strongest of the EFT runners, set a
new course record while leading
his teamates to their fourth
victory of the season.

Albany’s lack of depth partly
explains their second place finish.
Meehan, Rodriguez, and Franks
who also received points for State
finished a full two minutes behind
the strong running pair of Gepfert
and Hackett. The Harriers, who
generally run well on bills, were in
good position after the first half
of the race, but faded when they
reached the big hill on the RH
course.

Our record is
mediocre 4-3 record. Much of this
can be attributed to key injuries.
This is the first time in 8 years of

now at a

running that the Harriers have lost
more than two meets in a season,
but Coach Munsey still remains
optimistic. “We‘re gonna have a
winning season if it kills us—and it

The New York Mets have thus far hurdled two of the three

Council debates

poll on

by Ken Stokem

At last night’s meeting of
Central Council serious question
was raised concerning Academic
Affairs Commission’s handling of
the poll on the newly Proposed
Academic Calendar. Several
members of Council expressed
doubts about the effectiveness of
the poll and the manner in which
it is being presented.

To correct possible
inadequacies of the bill, Lenny
Kopp made an appropriation for
$75.00 to be used to buy a page
in the ASP in order to publish the
details of the Calendar. Kopp, in
refering to the problems of the
poll as it now stands, declared,

Continued from page I

Some illustrations in point:

--The senate recommended
the present system of unlimited
withdrawal from courses for
undergraduates and an
extension of the course
withdrawal period for
graduates.

“It approved the admission
of 200 disadvantaged youths in
the fall of 1968 in addition to
the usual admission quota.

-—A proposal committing the
university to take some
underpriviledged youths each
year from the New York City
College Bound Program was
also passed.

--A contract with Union
College to allow SUNYA
students to take ROTC without
credit at Union was another
senatc move.

Dr. 1'“inkc|slcln stated that
the university was ahead of its
time in making ROTC
non-credit, that other
univcrsitics were later forced by
student protests to (lo the
Slime.

--[n 1968 the senate took
unprecedented action in
recommending an
Afro-American Studies
Department.

--The Senate's Special
Committee on Undergraduate
Education in 1968 published a
report on “Patterns in
Undergraduatc Education."

Two of the report's
recommendtions are being put
into effect-- an Experimental
and a General College. The
former will combine the last.
years of high school with two
years of college, and the latter
will experiment with educating
for wisdom rather than career.

Concerning the scnatc's
academic attitude, Dr,
Finkelstcin remarked, “'l‘lwy‘vr-
tended to take a more liberal

view of education and
chClltionul objectives"smorl‘
flexibility."

In the area of student
behavior, tlic senate has
cooperated with the Studan

Affairs Council in changing the
university's stance from “'

lii
loco parcntis“ to "a very open
policy."

calendar

“student: have a right to know
exactly what the calendar says.
Picayune things are important.
Students need more information
to make an intelligent decision."

This was a reply to a statement

by one of Academic Affairs
Commission (AAC)
representatives to Council. AAC
feared, that if the calendar was
published in full, students would
vote against it on the basis of
picayune details.

Also, brought up by Lenny
Kopp was a bill for Publicizing
Results of Student Elections in
the ASP. The bill was amended to
say that the results of all elections
except the losers of Who‘s Who
shall be made public by Election
Commission. It passed in its final
form 16-6-0.

An Appropriation for $15,000
to increase the annual ' Jazz
Festival to a sort of
Pop-Jazz-Rock Festival was also
passed.

The rationale behind this bill,
introduced by Jeff Glassey and
Barry Ross, is that Special Events
Board and Contemporary Music
Council will each put up $15,000
to have the Festival in April. The
total of $110,000 will be used to
bring name groups of the caliber
of the “Blood, Sweat, and Tears”
to campus for this event.

evaluation of a number of these
new trends is in order.

Trends in American Cinema

The door opens, and creaks as u
shabbin dressed young man of
about twenty-five years of age
enters a dingy room, and beholds
the vision of his naked mother,
wallowing in her sixty years‘
accumulated fat, staring at the
bottlecap of an empty container
of Italian Swiss Colony.

The horrid stench of the room
is obvious as he smiles.

“How was your day,” she
earnestly inquires, as the camera
shifts to her lumpy back.

He somehow manages to open a
can of warm beer and unfnsten his
belt simultaneously. He replies:
“Mother, it was swell. Wonderful.
I met this absolutely gorgeous
hunk of muscle today, while we
were using adjacent urinals at the
YMCA."

Family films are rapidly

vanishing, thank God. For with
the advent of the boob tube, all of
America can view a boy who loves
his horse on television. However,
at the cinema , we are able to see
a boy who really loves his horse.

A major contributing factor, of
course, to the metamorphosis of
American Cinema is our affluence
which has allowed students to
become a primary motivating
force at the box office.

It was the American college
student who helped propel such
films as If.... Rosemary’s Baby,
The Graduate, and more recently
Midnight Cowboy into national
limelight.

Movies are now at the brink of
sophistication, for we, the college
students are sophisticated

Returning to a lighter vein, we
are fortunate that subtle art forms

superfluous, American censors. At
long last, we may envision love,
and its varied forms, and life, and
its pleasures and brutalities in
more accurate settings.

This trend in American cinema
is, hopefully, a reflexion upon
America in general. For although
we are called idealists for looking
about, and vomitting on the
America that allows ignorance and
poverty to breed and multiply
unharassed, although we are called
idealists for daring to think that a
world should evolve lacking such
trivia as selective service', hatred,
killing, and war, I say we are
realists. Or is realism sitting in an

Perhaps America is awakening.
Perhaps the remnants of Calvin
Coolidge America are dying. In a
haphazard, terse, unprofessional
manner, I have attempted to show
that films are changing. It was not
a major task, or one of special
difficulty. But perhaps America is
changing, too. (Walt Meristo goes
to movies.)
