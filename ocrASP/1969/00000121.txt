Pass-fail decision postponed
to await student senators

by William Johnson

The Faculty Senate Meeting has
been postponed until Monday
October 27 to permit the newly
elected student representatives to
orient themselves to their new
positions. At. that meeting the
debate on pass-fail grading system
will be continued. This was
announced at. Acting President
Alan Kuusisto's weekly
conference with students.

Progress is being made with the
Experimental College under, the
direction of Dr. Paul Mirva,
Assistant Vice President for
Academic Affairs. The plan calls
for combining the last two years
of high school and the first tow
years of college as the
un d ergraduate experience.
Proposals have been submitted to
the US. Office of Education and
the Ford Foundation and there is
hope that the program will get
under way this fall. Students
involved in the Experimental
College receive credit. for their
participation in the program.

Kuusisto was faced with a
barrage of questions on the
management of the new lecture
hall complex from concerned
students. Apparently,
microphones and other equipment
have been stolen from various
lccturc halls and the chalk supply
is rarely adequate. The president
said he would try to initiate a
system to “adequately supply and
maintain the lecture hall center
facilities."

Recent distrubing incidents on
university buses raised the
question of presenting ID. cards

to the bus drivers. Dr. Clifton
Thorne replied that the sign in
front of the buses stating the
requirement. of student ID. to
board the buses was not meant to
be enforced, but it was hoped that
it. would serve as a warning for
riders who were not members of

Dubois

the University Community.

Dr. Kuusisto also explained the
purpose of Dr. Benezets' visit here
last weekend as an opportunity
for the future president to locate
living quarters and to meet
informally with the Vice
Presidents and Deans.

park Dedication

encounters rightist foes

by Carol Hughes

Despite opposition, plans for
the establishment of the W.E.B.
Dubois Memorial Park will be
realized this Saturday, October
18th, near the ancestral home of
Dubois, west of Great Barrington,
Massachusetts.

The 2 p.m. program will be
highlighted by a dedication
address by Julian Bond of the
Georgia legislature, and include a
communication from Mrs. Dubois
and appearances by Dr. Horace
Bond (of Atlanta Univ.),
playwright William Gibson, and
Dr. Edmund W. Gordon (of
Columbia Univ.).

A five acre area, located around
the site where Dubois’ home once
stood, comprises the park, and
includes the “Dubois oak," a giant.
tree measuring 16 feet in
circumference. A ten ton granite
boulder, resting upon a raised
platform of earth will hold a
plaque citing Dr. Dubois' birth
and death dates and depicting him
as an historian, educator, civil
rights leader and co-founder of
the N.A.A.C.P. His profile and
quotation from his “Souls of
Black Folks" which reads:

will also be on the plaque.

The memorial park has,
however, encountered opposition
from more than 100 residents,
including local chapters of the
D.A.R., and Veterans of Foreign
Wars, as well as from mebers of
the John Birch Society.

Dissent centers about Dubois'
joining the Communist party two
years prior to his death. Editorials
appearing in the Berkshire
Courier, Great Harrington‘s
weekly newspaper, have also
denounced the plan.

The land is owned by Berkshire
real estate' man Walter Wilson, a
prime mover in the formation of
the memorial. Co—chairman is Dr.
Edmund Gordon, who is
scheduled to appear at the
ceremony on Saturday.

Many prominent. Americans are
among the sponsors of the
project, including Senator Edward
W. Brooke of Massachusetts,
I-Iarry Beliifonte, Norman
Rockwell, and Sidney Poitier.
