Once more, The War

What more can be said that has not yet been said? What statistics
can shock more than the statistics we have already wept over? And
yet, the killing does not end.

Tomorrow-tomorrow-it has always been the pivotal day. The war
was over- “ 've us a few more tomorrows-" The cry always of the
leaders who begged for more time to insure a military victory.

This time, it is our timorrow. It is our tomorrow to demonstrate
our hatred of war; it it is our tomorrow to learn, share and expound a
philosophy that v‘ aims not at death, but atylife.

The day of absence from classes is not a holiday from work, it is
not merely a stoppage of “business as usual"- it is the sign of a nation
which is wracked with war and wants peace. A nation and a people for
once, aiming at not a selfish victory nor an “honorable peace" which
satisfies nothing but a government’s desire to feel vindicated; but a
peace which comes about through a realization of the rights of people
the world over.

We urge you to partake in this national day of mourning—a day
mourning the senselessness of death in warfare.

Participate in those educational and emotional activities planned.
Demonstrate your faith in a move towards peace which searches not
for a vindication that does not exist.

it is our fervent hope that October 15 will begin the real end to the
senselessness of American involvement in Vietnam.

President Nixon, you may try, but it is impossible to ignore the cry
of an outraged America

 

There will be a rally of the candidates for the Faculty Senate on
Thursday, October 16, from 9:00 to 11:00 pm. in the Campus
Center. Each candidate will be available in a room to answer any
questions and talk with any students. The list of locations is given

To the Editors:

In answer to Miss Fay H. Stage's letter concerning
my article “The Exorcism of Grand Prix Rncing";l
am afraid Miss Stages hyper-emotional reaction
(she stated that she was ‘enraged’) stifled her
rational faculties in assessing my article. My
‘evidence' for incest (gossip) in small towns and
fratricide in Grand Prix racing rested in the
following arguments: 1) establishing an
etymological relationship between the words incest
and gossip and 2) demonstrating that small town life
and Grand Prix competition are ullegories, 1 repeat,
allegories, of mythic primal crime in the “context of
historical symbolism and mythology.” Apparently
Miss Stage is too much of n literalist to understand
literary metaphor and its relationship to so—called
“empirical reality."

in reference to Miss Stage's remarks on my use of
Watkins Geln’s sex education controversy as a case
history: nowhere in my article did I make any
editorial comments about the validity or invalidity
of the Glen's sex education program, a
presupposition the irrational Miss Stage takes for
granted. My point was that the hassle over sex
education was an excellent example 0f sniﬁu (own
gossip. It was irrelevant to my article whether or not
“wiser heads prevailed." Regardless of that fact, the
gossip in the Glen was still overwhelming—and an
analysis of gossip was central to the article.

If Miss Stage does not know that Watkins Glen,
like many another small town, is a forum for
"incestuous carnal politics," I submit that she is
naive about what takes place in her own
community. To paraphrase Bertolt Brecht slic bus
not yet been told the terrible news. I could have
givon many more examples of incestuous carnal
politics in the Glen beyond the one of gossip over
sex education. 1 did not do so (ironically enough)
because i did not wish to sensationalize or sling
mud-the substance of another one of Miss Stage's
ludicrous allegations.

Small town gossip is a self-evident truth. If Miss
Stage does not know or understand this truth, she
has it great deal to learn about human nature.

Snack Bar Clarification

To the Editor:

1 how noticed of late that certain misinformed
students have been complaining in regard to the
snack bur's recent decision to charge five cents extra
for toast on a sandwich. Let me clear up any
misunderstanding about this worthwhile innovation.

This is how the idea works: Say, for instance,
that in the usual noon snack bar lull you become
hungry and order a grilled cheese sandwich. instead
of wasting presious heat on making toast they will
heat the cheese alone, scrape it off the grill
somehow, and place it upon a piece of virgin white
bread, to which it shall immediately .idiicre, owing
to the adhesive quality of melted cheese. Here you
linvc gotten everything you asked for: H grilled
cheese snndwiclrwhilc in thr- pusl the snack bar
went by the rather personal and prying assumption
that you wanted grilled bread as well. Well, no more
getting what you didn’t ask for. i believe, as i am

sure the great majorityof students do, that it's time
that the university stopped telling us what we want.

In this new action by the snack bar we have
found only a beginning, and we hope it shall
continue to grow. Frankly, I am quite tired of
getting two pieces of bread wrapped around a
sizzling grease fried hnnburger where all I asked for
is a hamburger alone. What’s more, since the
electricity required to toast a piece of bread costs
approximately 1/100th of a cent, if my calculations
are 'correct , charging extra for to is not charging

extra at all; youare just paying for services rendered.
Obviously, you can't give them 1/100tb of a cent
extra every time you want toast instead of soggy
bread every time you want a BLT, and since no one
likes handling permits, the next smallest
denomination, and therefore the likeliest is a nickel.

I commend the non-profit snack bar on this
worthwhile institution. From now on I want to see
extra charges for heat everywhere. When i ask for
Roast Beef 1 want it uncooked. I want my Bacon
uncooked. i want my fried salami uncooked. i want
the snack brir to continue its undying fight to make
the entire university eat it raw.

STUDENTS DEPLORING THE DEATH CULTURE, listening to the
names of those murdered by the government of these United States.

More stories, photos, pages 4,5.

State [Motility or Nu m n
l

by Rosemary Levine

Anyone who listened to even a
few of the names of the war dead
which were pronounced during
the Vietnam Moratorium Day
cannot help but be sickened at the
utter inconceivability of the
numbers of names called. One
almost has to choose a name at
random and think about it alone
to conceive of the horror involved
in even one individual loss.

Who was, for instance,
Jeremiah Scott? He was more
than a name but a man behind
one of 39,000 names. Not just
one of 39,000 statistics but one of
“a terrible sum of individual
tragedies," in the words of Nassau
County Executive Eugene
Nickerson.

Action sought against
$3,000 for Nov. 15 buses

Ed. Note: The following is the text of the refermipresented to the Supreme Court ofSludent Association
concerning the subsidy of $3000 towards sending buses to Washington for the November 15 march.

To: Supreme Court of the Student Association

Presented by: Bert Devorsetz Class of 1970

Statement

Thursday evening October 2, 1969, Central
Council Passed Bill N. 6970-24 which allocated
three thousand dollars ($3000) for partial
supplementation of the cost of buses to Washington
on November 15, 1969 for participation by students
in the march against the war in Vietnam. As
plaintiff in this action I contend that said
aforementioned bill is -in direct contradiction of
the trust and obligation between the Central
Council and the Student Body.

C.C. Bill N. 6768-73 states “Student Association
monies shall not be used to directly finance any
group which advocates any specific partisan political
viewpoint." 1 would herein state the precedent that
has been set in the past in regard to this policy.

Until November of 1967 Student Association lirrd
never funded any group of a partisan political or
religious nature. At that time Council enacted an
allocation of funds for the Young Americans for
Freedom chapter organized on the campus. This
allocation was recinded by a further paragraph of
bill 676873. No religious organization to my
knowledge has ever challenged the aforementioned
precedent.

Central Council has acted in direct contradiction
of prist statute and precedent. The group involved
will be the first six hundred students to buy tickets
for the bus. The march, not just the war, is a
partisan political Issue since there are, in fact,
different opinions on the subject and these opinions
are argued by politicians.

Furthermore Council has acted in breach of its
trust with the student body. Since the student tax
collected by the Student Association is mandatory

 

not voluntary the council is in fact charged With a
greater responsibility than it was when the Student
Association was voluntarily joined. The Board of
Trustees noted this in their recent pronouncements
(Board of Trustees of the State University of New
York). They stated that, student taxes collected
mandatorin could be disbused for, “educational,
social, recreational and cultural activities." No
mention is made of the funding of partisan political
efforts. Council has clearly violated both of these
noted statutes and have clearly gone against all
university precedent. Both these, statutes and
precedents, are reinforced now by the fact that all
students must pay the tax.

The issue then may come back to whether the
war or the march is a partisan issue, I believe
strongly that it is. For four years this country's
politicians have advocated differing political
opinions on the war, making the war a very partisan
issue. The march is labeled as an anti-war march. To
be anti-anything makes you partisan to a particular
viewpoint, to be anti-anything that deals with
government (it is the government's policy that is
being protested) is a partisan political issue.

To rectify this grievous wrong i ask the court in
its esteemed wisdom to invalidate the

aforementional allocation rind advise Central
Council of its duties in the dispersal of funds for
partisan political purposes.

The above facts are accurate to the best of

' my knowledge.

Bert Devorsatz

There will he an open hearing on the refemd this

Monday night at 7 PM. in lecture Center 6.

Albany

Nickerson joined so many other
people who spoke and sang and
acted before and more
importantly with, a huge crowd of
peace demonstrators on the State
Capitol steps and lawn. The
marchers came in a long column
which continued to stretch from
Draper Hall to the Capitol
building long after the first candle
bearers had settled on the lawn to
chant words of Peace.

And columns of marchers were
still arriving as Nickerson
concluded his speech. He clearly
and sharply ciriticized the
President’s stand that there is
nothing new to be learned from a
moratorium. “There are lessons to
be learned, Mr. President. Our

organize,

unify for pressure

which graduate students at this
university may operate, and bring
reason and pressure to bear in
order to secure their place as
members of the university
community."

G.S.A. will attempt to provide
a vitaluinstrument for an often
forgotten student group. Among
their primary concerns is the
institution of an equalizing pay
scale for graduate ossistants, who
at this university are among the
lowest paid in the nation. Hope
was expressed for graduate
representation on committees
deciding the future housing plans
of the campus. G.S.A. also
expects to take definite stands on
political issues both on and off
campus.

The organization will be headed
by an executive committee
consisting of officers, and
representatives of the various
departments of the University.
Membership will be proportionate
to the number of graduate
students in the school or college
of the University. Officers will be
elected October 21-22.

Nominees are:

President: Charles Stephenson

Executive Secretary: Arnold
Serotsky

Treasurer: Bernice Burns, Phil
Feil

questions to you...may not be
new, but you have yet to answer
them!" The candle light
procession was an extremely
impressive and to the activities
centered in Albany all day. There
was a silence somehow coupled
with intensity of feeling. Perhaps
it was, as someone said, the true
feeling of peace, something quiet
yet vibrant with joy.

The intensity of feeling was
evident as the thousands raised
their candles at the conclusions of
especially articulate statements, or
at the finish of a song, or, even in
impatience with one speaker (Dan
Button) who was becoming a bit
too rhetorical for the tastes of the
crowd.

Which statements expressed the
feeling of the crowd? What did
the speakers say?

Reverend Frank Snow said that
amnesty should be given to those
who have chosen prison or exile
because they believed in what
conscience dictates. "We ask
amnesty.. not forgiveness, for they
have nothing to be forgiven of.”
I‘A humble and penitent nation
should set them free."

Another clergyman stated that
“There has never been, in the
history of the world, a just war."
We can work for peace, flee for.
peace, resist for peace, even give
in for peace but “we cannot ever
fight for peace."

Members of a guerrila theatre
carried a flag-draped coffin down
the capitol steps, placing it
solemnly before a woman in
mourning. They folded the flag
carefully and gave it to the
woman, a remembrance of a dead
man. “Be the first on your block
to bring your son home in a
box..."

Quoting the statement that
“there is nothing so powerful as
an idea whose time has arrived,"
mayoral candidate O’Kain
declared that “Many years from
now when the Nixons and
Johnsons are swept into the
dustbins of time, Oct. 15 will
live."

There were many more
articulate statements greeted with
the soul of the crowd. But what
they all added up to was the
simple statement chanted by
thousands that night.

All we are saying, is give peace
a chance.

Drug charges pressed

against four students

Joint action by the Office of
Student Affairs and the University
Security Office resulted in the
arrest of four University students
on drug violation charges
Wednesday night.

A member of the residence
staff, discovering four students
apparently smoking marijuana,
detained the four and notified
Associate Dean of Students
Sorrell Chesin. The material was
turned over to campus security
police, and Cheriln asked State
Police for a lab analysis.

The direct involvement of
non-campus law enforcement in

 

the incident was the consequence
of Cheain’s action. Three students
were arrested dn charges of
loitering for the purpose of using
drugs, the other for criminal
possession of dangerous drugs in
the 11th degree, which is the
lightest charge that can be pressed
in such a situation.

According to Chesin, such
“flagrant violation of the law"
could not be ignored and left no
alternative action. He continued
to say that University policy
states that when federal, state or
local laws are broken, outside
police intervention ls warranted.
