Political in-fighting among a
number of members at radio
station WSUA over who would
succeed to the position of Station
Manager and the I various
department head positions he
appoints has created two
antagonistic factions competing
for these positions.

This conflict has caused at least
seven of the station’s more
talented staff members to place
themselves on the “inactive” list
or to resign from WSUA
altogether.

The cause of this internal
political problem which now
torments WSUA can be traced to
the election for Station Manager
last May and the events which
soon followed.

The earnest desire of the head
of Programming to correct
inefficiencies in the station,
however, sometimes gave way to
an oppressive temper which he
possessed. This caused hesitation
on the part of voting station

members, although they finally
made their choice on the basis of
superior ability.

This election was invalidated by
WSUA‘s Executive Committee
before it could take effect,
creating the internal split which
now exists. The main reasons

3) New Executive Committee

However. there remains the
possibility that the citation of

by dissatisfaction of the outgoing

Manager-elect and his new
appointees.

Therefore, one (.I' 1ho

FRIDAY, OCTOBER l7, I969

by Brian Moss

For thirteen hours the names of
dead American soldiers had
droned continuously form
loudspeakers on the Academic
podium. A somber mood had
settled over the crowd of about
one thousand quiet students and
Albany citizens as the names kept
going on and on.

So perhaps out of a sense of
anger, disheartenment, or simple
futility they were more than
anxious to hear the words of Dr.
Water Goldstein of the
University's political science
department and Congressman
Ogden Reid from Weatchcstcr.

In a fiery speech, the mass
media and the United States
Congress came under sharp attack
from Dr. Goldstein as he kicked
off the second state of
Moratorium Day at one p.m. here.
The theme for the speech was
supposed to be “The University as
a Force for Peace.“ When
announced, one could feel the
disappointment of the crowd. But
Goldstein went far beyong the
scope of his topic as he spoke.

This executive committee will
in turn appoint smaller
committees to deal with specific
areas of interest.

Eleven seats on the University
Senate have been reserved for
graduate students. Eight of these
seats will be elected through
G.S.A., the remaining three
appointed by the Executive
Committee.

Elections for officers,
University Senate representatives,
and representatives to the
Executive Committee of G.S.A.
will be held Monday and Tuesday,
October 20-21 at the entrance to
the Campus Center, and the CC

am Howitt,

media- 

In a speech punctuated with
loud applause, he first tried to
hearten those who felt that the
Moratorium and its
demonstrations were "worthless."
Pointing out the dismissal of
General Hershey, he said that this
was a direct result of the student
movement.

Then he went into a heavy
denunciation of the present U.S.
Administration. Calling Melvin
Laird a “Clown,” he stated that
“The American people are not
going to be bought off by the
plans for victory in Vietnam." He
passed off Spiro Agnew as the
"prize clown” of the
administration for his statement
on Tuesday that hte Moratorium

should denounce its
congratulations from the Vict
Cong.

After all, Goldstein mentioned,
the government is always happy
to receive a note form these
upholders of freedom named
Franco and Chiang Kai-Shek.
“The Nixon administration
showed no respect for the
American people.”

His attack shifted to the
ThieuAKy regime. Condemning
them as corrupt, and without
nerve, he said that "there can only
be one laser in the struggle, and
that it is ’I‘hieu and Ky and their
rich landlord friends. The clowns
say we should bail them out, that

we should bide time, but we
cannot support a South
Vietnamese democracy that is
corrupt."

Following the loud applause
received by this remark, he got
back to the university as a peace
force. “The university," he said"
is effective, articulate, and a home
of moral values. There are 7
million students in American
universities, and we today are
showing a reformulation of
patriotism."

“We have two targets today,""
he continued “they are the U.S.
Congress, and the mass media."
Condemning men like Speaker
John McCormack and Mench
Rivers as “senile old men," he
pointed out that politicians are
now becoming aware of the real
issues because of youth.

nounced

scam swarm  ' '

But, he saved his sharpest
words for the mass media, and

especially the mass media of the ;

Capitol area. Calling the mass

media “despicable,” he said that ‘

universities have been getting a
“raw deal" from the media and

that the people are “not getting . ~, ,

the real news, but propaganda ,
from Washington. The real story is .

corruption."

Goldstein received the loudest

acclain of the afternoon when he ' '

said that the CBS and NBC
broadcasting netwOrkS are
Hperverters of truth." He
continued urging that the students
must make three things clear to
the nedin. “To hell with them. We
are no longer overwhelmed or
impressed with them. We are
getting wised up about the graft
and Vietnam.

And we have a message...wc
have a passion for peace... and a
passion for peace and dignity."
After an overwhelming standing
ovation, the podium was given to
Representative Reid.

In a somewhat less forceful
manner, Reid also made many of
the same points. “i am proud and
privelegcd to join you in this
expression on nonviolcnce.
Today, October 15th is the
beginning of the end. Senator
Scott has suggested a sixty-day
moratorium on criticism of the
President. I say we‘ve had a
moratorium on criticism since
January. This gathering," he
continues, “is in the great
tradition of American democracy.
Let no one be mistaken. We wnnt

the war ended and no more
Vietnams."

Criticizing the South
Vietnamese government, Reid

discussed the fact that after more
than a decade of training the
ARVN (Army of the Republic of
Viet Nam,) last year refused to fill
40,000 places vacated by the U.S.
Arnmy. “If the South Vietnamese
refuse, why should we fight?"

Upon completing its summer

deliberations, it

the

University Community to hear the
