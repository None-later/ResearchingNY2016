Futuristic Parade

On Saturday, the Homecoming
Parade will march into the future
with the theme “2001.”
Revolutionary in many respects,
the parade will break the
“university centered" idea of past
parades. Starting at 1:00 p.m.
from the Dutch Quad parking lot,
the series of ﬂoats will proceed
down the Perimeter Road to the
parking lot across from the gym.

Sororities, fraternities, clubs
and dorm groups will compete for
“Parade's Best," “Most Colorful,"
"Most Imaginative," and “Best
Theme." Individuality and
originality will be the basis of the
awards, thus giving small groups a
fair chance. Trophy winners will
be announced following the
soccer game.

Athletic Events

The Invitational Cross Country
Meet, beginning at 12 noon, will
be taking place simultaneously
with the parade. The meet will be
most competitive, featuring teams
from Boston State, Syracuse,
Colgate and Trenton State. Parade
spectators are requested to watch
out for runners, as the routes of
the meet and the parade will, in
some parts, coincide.

At 2 p.m. immediately
following the parade, the Great
Danes will battle Stony Brook in

orchestra will begin at 9 p.m. A
prime ribs of beef buffet dinner

It's unbelievable, ridiculous, impossible. The chances were one out
of a hundred. It could never happen (at least Leo Durocher didn‘t
think sol). And yet, somehow, some way they did it. Maybe in ﬁfty
years someone will ﬁgure out just how, but in the mean time we can
only sit and scratch our heads and ponder and think and examine
every conceivable way it could have happened and after all that,just
accept the fact that the Meis really did win it all and it will go down
in the record books and the newspapers and the magazines and some
people will have taped on the radio or have photos of it or have a bag
of dirt from the inﬁeld or have a piece of sod from the outﬁeld to
commemorate it and have proof of it and still, still it will seem unreal.

The thing is, there was never, there isn‘t and there never will be any
reason for it. By all means, it could deﬁnitely not happen again (if it
did happen alreadyl). How could Tommie Agce go from hitting .2]?
with fhomeruns and l7 RBl's to a season of .280. 20 homcruns and
77 RBI’s? How could Clcon Jones hit .3407 How could Tom Seaver
win 25? How could Tug McGraw have the lowest liRA in the league?
How could Ed Charles still dress hhnscll‘? How could Ari Shanisky
score from third on a triple? How could the whole damn learn go
from ninth place to World Champs winnng 100 games in the process?

I guess the only answer for all of it is that if you believe. if you
truly think it can happen, rather it will happen, and you never stop,
than it will indeed come true. And we did believe!

SPORT SHORTS ,

The State University at Albany
varsity soccer team, struggling
along with a 0-3-2 mark, travels to
Rochester Saturday to play
Rochester Tech. Thereafter, four
of the Great Danes' five remaining
games will be at home. Coach Bill
Schieffelin‘s squad was tied, 2-2,
by Central Connecticut in its most
recent outing and has scored just
eight goals in five games. Jim
Shear (senior, Endicott) and
Demetrious Michael (junior,
Greece) have accounted for three
each.

Baby Dane Boaters

Harriers Remain Winless

The junior varsity soccer team
remained winless as they dropped
a 3-1 decision to RPI on
Wednesday. Coach John Barret’s
pup booters did not discredit
themselves, however, as they
showed fine overall hustle and
tenacity against a very tough
Engineer contingent.

The score stood at lvl at the
end of the first half. Phil Cull
scored the Albany marker. This
was only the second goal for the
team in three games. Like their
older varsity brothers, their main
problem is putting the ball in the
net. (The varsity has scored only
eight goals in five games). RPI
took command in the second
stanza, scoring two more goals to

' provide the final margin. State's
goalie, Mike Shanda, made 30
saves against RPI's fine attack.

The Baby Danes play their next
game at home, Saturday against

Brooklyn College. The
begins at 2:00 p.m.

Meanwhile, on Monday, the
junior vuristy cross country squad
ran up against Cobleskill
Community Colllege, the national
junior college champs and came
away second best.

Cobleskill, led by Gary
Connors, took the first six places,
thus shutting out the State
barriers. Connor's time was 18
minutes and 18 seconds, only 30
seconds off the 3% mile course
record held by All-American Ron
Stonitsch of CW. Post.

John Comerford, State's
captain was the first Dane runner
to finish, coming in with a time of
20:08, which was good enough
for seventh place. John Stanton,
second for Albany, was ninth in
20:18, while co-captain Rene

TXO 13-0. The first score came
on a spectacular seventy yard
interception by Dave Hawley. The
second touchdown came on the

However, KB sent split end

he was wide open and scored
easily. TXO was hurt by first half

point - and KB's four
interceptions held them in check.
