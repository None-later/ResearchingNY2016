Telling people about the
“monkey-demons" is just about
the toughest undertaking I’ve ever
given myself. When people listen
to me, some understand and tell
me they‘re known about the
“monkey-demons" without being
able to name them.‘ Of course
there are the others who laugh at
me or tell me they believe me
when they really don't. If you're
one of these people, you needn’t
go any further.

' First, let me clarify something
I’ve given them the name
“monkey-demons" merely to give
them identity, so that when I do
speak of them they are less
abstract.

Monkey-demons is the force
behind the conformity idea. They
pressure people to follow ideas of
society. The less conventional
people feel this pressure
constantly. The pressure can build
to such a point, so as to make one
question his own ideals. to make
one wonder whether he is right in
thinking the way he does. if the
monkey demons have their way,
no thinking people will be left.
Philosophy will not exist, because
there will be only one philosophy
with everyone thinking the same

Special Events Board

needs student help

Special Events Board will have
an Open Meeting tonight at 7:30
in Campus Center Room 375 for
all those students that signed up
on Activities Day and for anyone
elst that is interested in the Board.

Special Events, encompassing
many traditional and novel
campus activities, are sponsored
by the Board. The purpose of
these events is to present a variety
of entertainment for the
University and area community.
The co-chairmen depend almost
totally on student assistance and
participation. Not only is student
help welcome but individual
effort is greatly appreciated.

Special Events Board offers the
student who is interested in
participating in student activities a
wide variety of choices and
experiences. Students can become
involved on any level from the
Board down. Quite often students
want to get involved in activities
but don't because they feel that
they do not have the time and
that it will lower their wade-z

The activities, unlike some
clubs are not year round. For
example, if a student wanted to

work on Holiday Sing he would
be all finished shortly after it was
over. The amount of time that
you need to give is flexible and
you can for the most part decide
when and how much time you
will devote. A vast array of talents
and jobs are offered.

The Board needs people for
everything form actors which
require certain specialized skills to
ticket selling which required
virtually none. People are also
needed for many other things (e.g.

publicity, typing, ushering,
decorating, telephone calling,
scheduling, etc.)

The Board has already

sponsored Activities Day and the
Fall Concert (Blues Bag ’69). It
also sponsors Homecoming,
Campus Chest, Telethon, Talent
Show, Holiday Sing, Jazz Festival,
Parents Weekend, State Fair,
mixers and cultural events.

Information about these events
and the need for At-Large

meeting. If you are interested in
working on any of these events or
if you have questions or are
interested in starting a new event

‘ We work

not throwing rocks at

by Kathy Reillv

"We try to work inside of
buildings, not to throw rocks at
them." Spokesman Steve Villano
sums up the principles of the New
Democratic Coalition, a group of
about 150 students, organized on
campus to ﬁll the void between

the radical SDS and the
conservative YAF‘

Allied Willi the state and
national N.D,C,, which was

formed in February of this year,
Albany's is apparently the only
existing College simpler. It is
hoped that attempts will be made
to establish the NDC at other area
nnd'stutc colleges in the near
future.

Oriented lowurds
sludcnls and members of
minoritygroups, its eventual goal
is to wrest Democratic party
control from the “old guard" like
Chicago ’5 Mayor Daley and
Hubert Humphrey.

The NDC docs try to support a
Democratic party candidate
whenever possible. If, however, n
Democrat differs radically in his
political views on policies, another
nominee wins their endorsement.
In New York City, for example,
Democrat Mario Procnchino, by
NDC standards is unduly
conservative, so John Lindsay, a

inion II on new calendar
1(3ng dong: Council again ‘

by Ken Stokem
At this past Thursday's short
Central Council meeting, the

outstanding event was again the
discussion on the effectiveness or
ineffectiveness of the Opinion Poll
taken by Academic Affairs
Commission on the Proposed
Academic Calendar. The results of
the Poll were 361 for and 68
against. The poor turnout for this
important issue tends to cast some
doubts on the effectiveness of the
manner in which the Poll was
taken. Also, it seems that there
may have been ample opportunity
for stuffing the ballot box.

At the previous week's meeting
Lenny Kopp and Norm Rich had

important role in the October 15
moratorium; members helped plan
the candlelight march from
Draper to the Capitol, personally
visited every suite to urge the
boycotting of classes, and
contacted all 150 churches in the
Albany area to seek support for
the moratorium.

Some members of the campus
group are working jointly with the
Democrats in the State Capitol on
research projects, This spring, the
slate New Democratic Coalition
will open an Albany city
headquarters, probably before the
slate primary, and the University

chapter plans on providing
assistance.
chcrul ussemblymem have

already agreed to participate in
campus debates on various issues.
Future speakers include Ogden
Reid, Paul O'Dwyer, Jonathan
Bolinsky and Gordon Bingham.

Stressed was the point that the
New Democratic Coalition is not
merely a revitalization of the
Young Democrats. Rather, it is a
completely new organization, and,
unlike the Young Democrats, is
independent of party control.
Sincn neither the national nor the
state Democratic party
contributes any money, the group
is presently very low on funds.

NDC meetings are held every
other Tuesday, including October
21; everyone, including those with
differing political views, is
welcome to attend. Speakers are
often invited, and open, frank
discussions are encouraged. Al,
tonight's meeting the question of
organization and officers will
briefly be presented. Freshmen
and sophomores, cspccinlly, are
urged to participate,

The. NDC will again sponsor an
appearance of Paul O’Dwyer of
Sunday, October 26 . O'Dwyer
will give an informal lulk on the
effects of the moratorium, and
additional alternatives to students
seeking unite war uctlvities.

on the calendar. An appropriation
was made to buy a full-page in the
ASP to publicize the entire
calendar. It seems however that
lthe effort was effectively
sidetracked, by passing
responsibility of enacting it from
the President of Central Council
to the Chairman of Finance
Committee, to Academic Affairs
Commission. As a result, the
calendar will probably go into
effect with questionable student
backing.

In other action Central Council
passed a bill, introduced by Vic
Looper, requesting that an Ad
Hoc Committee be formed to
study the possibility of having the
Student Association construct and
operate student housing. Doug
Goldschmidt, a former member of
Council, lead the support for the
Committee. It will look into the
legal and financial problems of
such an operation.

control

and save the world

by Diane White

The importance of birth
control and family planning were
the topics of a meeting Sunday
sponsored by Trinity Young
Adults. Mr. Schendell, executive
director of the Planned
Parenthood Association of
Albany, conducted the meeting
by lecturing, distributing
pamphlets, presenting a film, and
answering questions.

The necessity of responsible
parenthood in a world of rapidly
increasing population was stressed
by Schendell. Today there are
approximately 3.6 billion
inhabitants on the earth.

According to Planned
Parenthood, it is practically
inevitable that this number will
double by 2080 even if the birth
rate is decreased by stringent birth
control practices. At the present,
only 10% of the world has access

to adequate birth control
information.
Mr. Schendell foresees the

institution of radical changes in
order to curb the population
explosion. lf family planning is
not effective by voluntary
practice, the government may be

forced to limit couples to
procreating no more than two,

It was stressed that all religious
groups favor some way of limiting
the size of families. The Roman
Catholic Church, much criticized
for its disapproval of artitificial
contraceptives, was in fact the
first church to publicly endorse
the rhythm method of birth
control.

A film entitled QUESTIONS
AND ANSWERS ABOUT BIRTH
CONTROL was shown, which
described the most effective
measures including oral
contraceptive pills, intrauterine
devices, condoms, diaphragms, the
rhythm method, vaginal foams,
and creams and jellies.

Mr. Schendell extended an
invitation to all young couples to
come visit Planned Parenthood of
Albany before their marriage.
Fees range from $4 to $15
depending on ability to pay.

Girls under the age of 21 must
be recommended to Planned
Parenthood by someone else, such
as a doctor, clergyman, or parent.
The local address is 225 Lark
Street, and the phone number is
463-5432.
