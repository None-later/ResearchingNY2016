Friday night saw the
inauguration of the new
Performing Arte Center Recital
Hall with the second of the
Faculty Series Concerts, a flute
recital by Irvin Gilman of the
faculty here, accompanied by
Dennis Helmrich on piano and
harpsichord. The new recital hall
is easily the most opulent room
and best designed theatre on
campus, and the crystal chandalier
in it is purely a jewel of
perfection.

The program began with Sonata
IV for flute and harpsichord,
supposedly by Mozart, although a
number of factors, principally its
low Koechsl index number of 13,
and mainly the extremely
sophisticated counterpoint in
some sections, seem to weigh very
heavily against this being the work
of an eight-year old. More likely it
is a work of J.C. Bach which the
young Mozart either copied or
transcribed for his own use, and
later being discovered in his
manuscript, was erroneously
thought to be his. This light and
airy work, which oddly enough,
ended with a minuet, received a
very sturdy performance from
Messrs. Gilman and Helmrich.

The next work's authenticity,
however, is scarcely to be
questioned. The Sonata in B
minor, S. 1030, for Flute and
Cembalo Obbligato by J.S. Bach is
one of the most rugged pieces in
the literature, and was a piece that
offered considerable challenges to
both players. in fact, the only
time during the entire concert
when I felt in the least dissatisfied
with the performance came during

crusts

the second movement of this
piece when the players seemed to
be fighting their instruments.

The second half of the concert
consisted of two very interesting
and different twentieth century
pieces for flute. The ﬁrst was
Edwin London's “Song and
Dance," which was written for
Mr. Gilman, and which, to my
ears at least, was a rather pleasant
piece of concert jazz that had
however, some weak spots.

Fluency was the key word here.
The three players, expecially Mr.
Gilman, were very much at ease in
the very ﬂuid language that the
piece was written in. Another
interesting aspect of the piece was
that it had a part for snare drum
improvisation, played very well
here by Mr. Thomas Brown, also
of the faculty.

The final piece on the program
was the Prokoﬁev Sonata for
Flute, Op. 94. This work dates
from the relatively free years of
the Second World War, when the
Russian government was too busy
fighting Nazis to regulate musical
styles much, and as a result,
contains some of Prokofiev’s
prettiest (and best) music. In its
four movements it encompasses
pretty much what Prokofiev was
all about, with its broad arching
melodies, its lush harmonies, its
formalism, and its extremely dry
wit and grotesquerie.

Performance-wise, this piece
was for me the height of the
evening, receiving a very loving
performance at the hands of
Messrs. Gilman and Helmrich. As
an encore, they performed the
Saint-Sacns “Voliere” from the
“Carnival of the Animals." All in
all, a very fine concert.

in search of file uiate

freedom" on a motorcycle odyssey through the southwestern United States.

 

 

THE EVOLUTION OF CINEMA

by Tom Quigley

 

 

"We blew it"—
---Captain America

EASY RIDER is the ultimate
crash. Peter Fonda and Dennis
Hopper, the disconcerting auteurs
of the film, have fashioned a
frightening non-movie that
records the beauty and bestiality
of America 1969 with
acrimonious benevolence. Captain
America and Billy, the ironic
west-to-cast pioneers, cycle
through the southwest groping for
a freedom that can only be found
through self-realization.

Their fruitless asphalt odyssey,
in search of a mythologically
emancipated America, is
inevitably destroyed by their own
innocent egoism and the reality of
intolerant, self-righteous bias that
roadblocks any easy ride. The
recognize too late their own
susceptibility to social corruption.

Captain America and Billy are
victims of the monetary necessity
that motivates us all. Fonda as
America tools around on his
glistening machine with a tankful
of prostituted cash netted from
their drug running. He realizes
that the cash fuels the trip and
when the tank is empty
termination sets In. He is the from
of the two because unlike Hopper
he senses that the freedom rond
isn‘t two-lime nnd tarmac but. an
inner journey townrd the core of
aclf—reullzution.

Hoppcr’s preoccupation with
cxternnl scnsntlon makes him
oblivious to his quest in the
direction of artificial freedom. lie
is shackled by his own freaky
mnchinntions which leave him
incredulous ut Fondu‘n finnl
dissolutionmcnt.

The film is u plotlcss,
frce-whccling series of humanistic
confrontations with n myriud of
Amoricnn types from farmers to
communal dwellers, giving it the
aura of cinomn verito naturalism.
As the ride progresses however,
Fonda's statement becomes
cynically clear. There are two

major forces vying for supremacy
in modern America. One is a
humanistic ethic perpetuated by
the Bill of Rights which supports
the equality of man and gives him
the initiative to be. The other is
the Protestant work ethic which
also supports self-determination
but indirectly fronts for a
deplorable selfish doctrine of
undeclared opportunism.

One ethic supports humanity;
the other supports money. The
winner of this devastating
juxtaposition is the foundation
god of the work ethic:
materialism.

Everyone is so busy getting
their own thing together,
attempting to divorce his own
tight little circle from the human
family, that independence and
liberty have literally been
prostituted for petty cash. A
puritanical lovelessness and
suspicion of change perpetuated
by this back-stabbing bourgeoisie
attitude have replaced the human
struggle for honesty and justice
with a fearful social climb of. the
expense of others. Not only are
the red-necks and established
orders guilty of this callous
disregard for humanity but the
Captain Americas and Billys share
the blame with their ignorant
hedonistic ethic.

Dennis l-loppcr's directornl
debut is impressive. He purposely
subordinates himself to the Fonds
character by overucting in order
to bring out the subtleties of
Fonda's brooding nnturc. At times
Fondu resembles n young ’l‘om
Joud (once played by his fnthcr)
in scnrch of that justice and
equality that everyone seeks. The
ﬁlm could have been his if it
hadn't been for the brilllnnt
performance of duck Nicholson,
who plays George Hanson, a

sotted ACLU lawyer.
Nicholson's caustic bayou
twang has a profound effect upon
Fonda's consciousness, making
him understand the futility of a
"search for freedom." His
incredibly sarcastic humor
examines the American paranoia
that fears destruction from
external forces yet fails to realize
the smug internal decay that
signals an incurable social illness.
Nicholson is the conscience of the
ﬁlm. His naturalism steals the easy
ride.
Finally, Lazlo Kovacs'
cinematography captures and
blends a landscape of fantastic
geological beauty with soft filter
lens hues, adding to the poignancy
of the tragedy.

EASY RIDER is an abrasive
ﬁlm that jolts people into militant
opinions about the state of
American mores. The
Fonda-Hopper film is an honest
analysis of the word "freedom"
and its applications in our uptight
society. The movie is a tribute to
the courage of independently
produced films of true importance
and to the fortitude of its creators
who made it work.
