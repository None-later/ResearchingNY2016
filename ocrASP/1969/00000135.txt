 Image buildin
 path of Youn

by Leslie Levine
Ed. Note: This is the second in a
series of feature articles examining
political groups on campus.

The process of getting
candidates elected is long and
complicated. and there just aren‘t
enough professional politicians to
oversee the entire operation.
Supplemental support must arrive
from below, and polil ical
organizations, such as the Young
Republicans, on college campuses
direct the vitality and motivation
of students towards the aims of
the national, state and local
parties,

The Young Republicans saw
its conception on the Albany
State Campus about three years
ago during the 1966-61 term as an
affiliate of the State College
Republican organization and has
proceeded along a path towards
image building and membership
recruitment. Its basic purpose is
two-fold: to help the political
campaigns of Republican
candidates and to get them

Student committee worhs on
the elimination of requirements

by Nancy Durisli

Active student support on the
issue of abolishing undergraduate
requirements at the University
was demonstrated at the open
meeting of CURE (Comm. for

Undergraduate Requirement
Elimination), a subcommittee of
Academic Affairs Commission, on
Wednesday evening.

The Committee's main purpose,
that of reviving a now tabled
University Senate proposal to
eliminate undergraduate
requirements at the University,
was discussed at length and two
distinct working committees were
organized.

Tcntatively, the proposal will
call for the elimination of all
Universitywidc undergrad
requirements including: 12 hours
of math and science, 9 hours of
humanities, 12 hours of social
science, and 6 hours of language.

None of the departmental
requirements, however, would be
eliminated. Sutdents are still
obligated to complete 120 credit
hours to graduate, including the
required number of hours in their
major and minor.

The purpose of CURE's first
committee meeting is the
formulation of the rationale
concerned with the elimination of
requirements to be presented to
the University Senate. This
includes canvassing and
accumulating the opinions of
departinan chairmen, faculty and
administrators. and drawing up
the rationale and final plan of
impll-nicnting the proposal.

According to ()URE spokesman
Stcvc Villano, the Publicity
Committee also has several vital
functions. The members will
conduct an opinion poll of faculty
members by department, and
devise a complete advertising
campaign on campus, including a
newsletter, to inform students of
the proposal.

The intensive advertising
campaign will urge students to
vote in the referendum on Dec.
3,4 and 5, expressing their views
on whether or not they favor

eliminating undergraduate
requirements.
The results of the poll are

extremely important since
theywill be presented, along with
the proposal and the rationale by
the CURE Committee to the
University Senate either Dec. 8 or
15 for approval.

In addition to Villano, the
original members of the
Committee (Steve Bookin, Phil
Cantor, Sue Elbcrger, and Alinc
Lepkin) are very optimistic about
the proposal, and feel that the
resolution will be retroactive ()‘1Ce
it passes the Univ. Senate. This
would mean the elimination of
those requirements for all
undergraduates at the University
beginning in the spring of 1970,

 

 

 

elected , and to perform a
fuctional role in student affairs.
As its membership has steadily
increased to the present
enrollment of 130 members, the
club is proceeding towards its
goals.

In projecting a new image,
the Young Republicans has
attempted to dispel old notions of
Republican organizations as
super-conservative groups and has
acted more liberally. By affiliating
with a New York State group.
rather than directly with the
national organization, the club has
allowed itself more leeway in its
lib eral expression (New York
State Republican politics tend to
be more liberal than national
Republican politics).

The Young Republicans
issued a policy statement
supporting the Octoberlﬁ
Vietnam Moratorium, under the
premise l lial “we can't wait
forever for peace." As a group,
the Young Republicans didn't
perform a great role in the march
on the Capitol, but as individuals
they blended in with the other
thousands ofmarchers. Club
President Fran Baltisti,
in l roduccd Congressman Dan
Button at the Capitol.

Prior to the recent
moratorium, the Young
Republicans took an active role in
only one other campus issuer—lust
year’s Open Campus controversy.
Along with Phi Beta Lambda, the
Young Republicansissued a
statement and organized support
for the maintenanc' of an open
campus. The results of their liibor
were extremely impressivewthe
largest turnout ever for a
referendum.

Even in light of all this, it
would be foolish to undermine
the Young Republicans active role
in Republican politics.

Walinsky: Kennedy, MOBE man

discusses Vietnam and elections

by Kenneth Deane

“There is no one who can stand
up and say ‘i have a dream',"
asserted Adam Wiilinsky, a former
Kennedy aide and anti‘wnr
movement lcadcr speaking here on
Wednesday, Oct. 22 on “The
Students’ Role in the Nixon Era."
Following the speech was a
spirited question-answer period.
His visit was sponsored by Forum
of Politics,

Walinsky, whose lecture was
humorous and at times biting,
centerd upon the students role in
ending the war in Vietnam and
the activities of the October 15th
moratorium. He considers the
moratorium to have manifested
the revival of purpose in the
nation and the rcnwakcning of thc

fervent hope of the early 60's for
an end to war, poverty, and racial
discrimination.

In answer to questions
concerning Vietnam Walinsky said
that totiil withdrawal of United
States troops from Victnam was
the only way to end the conflict
and that unless immediate action
was taken the government would
be faced with a major and violent
confrontation.

ilc denied the existence of any
prevelant conservative trend. But
he did say that unless an effective
liberal leader could be found who
would challenge the established
institutions on behalf of the
downtrodden, then those who
desired change would be forced to
gravitate to any dcmagoguc who

proposed to attack the system, as
witnessed in George Wallace’s
1968 presidential campaign.

When questioned about his own
political future Wiilinsky revealed
that he is seriously considering
running for Attorney General of
New York State.

g, recruitment?
g Republicans

  

  
    

Students for Rockefeller grew out
of the organization, when the
Governor announced his intention
to seek the Republican
Presidential nomination. A
massive rally attracting 3000
people was held for Rockefeller,
and three club members went to
Miami to offer assistance at his
headquarters.

As for the New York
gubernatorial election of 1970,
the club stands behind
Rockefeller all the way, citing
that he is the most “fantastic
thing that ever happened to the
stiite"—his educational advances
(development ofthe State
University system), welfare
measures, health acts and
transportation projects (the Long
Island Railroad ???). For those
New Yorkers who complain of
their rocketing taxes, the Club
contends that taxpayers in New
York are reaping the most
benefits for theirmoney, as
compared with other states.

Currently, the groupis
activelyworking for the ouster of
Erastus Corning from the post of
Albany’s mayor, to be replaced by
their favorite, llartheimei‘.
Students for Hartheimcr is a loose
coalition of people who are not
necessarily Republicans,simply
A nit-Corning and corruption.
Over one-hundred strong, the
group has conducted polls at
shopping centers, canvassed from
door to door, operated sound
trucks, joined Hartlieimer &
Goddell on their walk through
Albany, conducted a twenty—four
hour party for Hartheimer,
featuring the addressingof
thousands of envelopes, and got
voters to the polls to register.
When Election Day finally arrives,
club members will be babysitting
at the polls, driving people to the
polls, and those over twenty-one
will be poll watchers.

it 's difficult to make
predictions for the future of the
Young Republicans. However,
club plans focus around the
recruitment of new members, a
discarding of a conservative image,
and perhaps most important a
partaking in campus issues—quite
an ambitious project fora
Republican group in ii country
where the national Republican
image is rapidly withering away.
