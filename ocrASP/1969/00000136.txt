“A Leap of Fait ” exhibition
displays modern Israeli art

A large exhibition of
contemporary p ai n t i n g ,
sculpture, and graphics from Israel
is scheduled to open on Sunday,
October 26, at the Art Gallery of
State University of New York at
Albany.

The exhibition is titled, “A
Leap of Faith: Israeli Art 1969.” I
has been organized over the past
year by Professor Donald
Mochon, the gallery's director, in
collaboration with Mrs. Bertha
Urdang, the director of the Rina
Gallery in Jerusalem.

Mrs. Urdang, whose gallery
was the first in Israel to
concentrate on showing the work
of serious Israeli artists, has
written an introduction to the
catalogue being prepared for the
Israeli exhibition in which she
says of the exhibit, “There is no
thematic axis, no hard core of
prejudice, no urge to prove a
point, for the spectrum is wide."

“A Leap of Faith“ has been
selected by Mr. Mochon and Mrs.
Urdang with theintention of
providinga wide stylistic
spectrum. Michael Gross‘s abstract
canvases evolve from the hard
light and landscapes ofthe
country. The sculptor Yigal
Tumarkin, on the other hand, has
evolved a highly personal kind of
graphic and sculptural images that
have little to do with his external
surroundings in Israel. Hannah
Levi, Arie Aroch, and her student
Raffi concern themselves also
with private images and the
calligraphyof
abstract-expressionist painting.
The current international interest
in hard-edge and minimal art is
reflected in the immaculate
painted metal sculpture of Benni

Efrat.

Th e ex h ibit was selected
with the intention of showing the
work of both established and
younger artists. Painters such as
Joseph Zaritsky, who has been in
Israel since 1923, have an
international reputation. Zaritsky,
regarded by Mrs. Urdang as the
“grandfather” of Israeli art, has
produced a number ofgifted
students. Among them is Avigdor
Stematsky, a Russian by birth,
whose work is alsointhe

exhibition. I
Many of the middleand

young generation ofartists
represented in “Leap of Faith"
are native-born Israelis. Included
in the group are Uri Lifshitz,
Aviva Uri, and Ori Reisman. Also
included in the exhibition are
Menashe Kadishman and Shlomo
Koren, Israeli painters who work
abroad.

The exhibition will be
opened at a reception in the

gallery from 4 to 7 p.m. October
26 by the Hon. Rechavam Amir,
Consul General of Israel and Allan
A. Kuusisto, acting president of
SUNY at Albany. “Leap of Faith”
will be in the university gallery
through November 23.

*sxas

An exhibition of 21 recent
prints and drawings by Margaret
Davies will be shown at the Art
Gallery, State University of New
York at Albany, from October 26
through November 23. The prints
in the exhibition are mixed media
works combining the techniques
of etch I n g , silk-screen, and
collagraph.

Mrs. Davies, who was born in
Boston and educated at Wellesley
College and Montana State
University, received her Master of
Arts degree inPrintmaking in
1968 at Montana, The SUNYA
exhibit will be Mrs. Davies’ first
one-man show.

fans have suffered through a low
ebb, a sort of interim period.
However, it is our opinion that if
this year's recent releases are any
indication, the drought may be
over and comedy may be about to
embark upon its second greatest
“In the article, Agce states,
“There is no hope that screen
comedy will get much better than
it is without new, gifted
comedians who really belong in
the movies and without freedom
for their experiments."

It seems that that time has
finally come. Jack Lcmmon has
been around for a long time; he
just seems to get better and better
as “The April Fools" attest.
Dustin Hoffman is a mature
comedy star at 26; his deadpan
rivals the great Blister Keaton's.

Broadway play of the same name,
contains two firsts which should
make it a tremendous box-office
success. It is Ingrid Bergman's first
picture in twenty-odd years, and
for Goldie Hawn, of “Laugh-In"
fame. her first ever. Walter
Mathau, one of the best comedy
stars of the decade, plays the male
lead; Jack Weston gives his
typically good performance as the
“derelict mooch."

Goldie Hawn may not strike
you as much of an actress on
“Laugh-In" but in CACTUS
FLOWER she is simply marvelous.
She tones down her dumb blond
act and gives probably the
funniest performance by an
actress since Judy I'Iolliday
stopped making pictures. Ingrid
Bergman shows that her forced
retirement (she was blackbnlled
because she had an illegitimate
childnmy, how times have
changed!) has caused her to lose
none of the talent which made her
one of the greatest stars of all
time. Walter Mathau is topnotch

With this film, Gene Saks
proves himself to be one of the
few directors who can really
handle comedy. His alyle, 'r‘. a
word, is unobtrusive; he lets his
actors carry the tempo, filming
them without any fancy,
gimmicky shots.

It is almost impossible to
review a film like this without
sounding trite; you simply run out
of superlativus. Let us suffice to
say that CAC’I‘US FLOWER is the
most nearly perfect comedy film
made in the last decade.

(Note: CAC'I‘US FLOWER will
open at the Circle Cinema on
Christmas Eve. Students may pick

very warm performance.

The program opened with
“Adagio” from J.S. Bach's
“Toccata in C," a very beautiful
slow movement performed with a
lot of feeling. Dr. Ghiradella’s
very light and graceful playing
technique was revealed by the
ﬂoating motion of her hands as
they came on and off the
keyboard. Her total engrossment
in the music further accentuated
the beautiful melody played by
Dr. Allen on the cello.

“Sonata in G," a piece by
Breval, was the second work on
the program. This was the only
piece in the performance that
really disappointed me, not only
because of its simplicity, but
because it did not seem to be at
the point of refinement that a
piece should be at before it is
played in recital.

Brahms' “Sonata in F for
Violoncello and Piano-~Opus 95)"
was played next. It was here that
both instruments really came to
life. Unlike in the previous piece.
the “Sonata in F" was very
expressive and colorful. The
capabilities of both players really
became evident in this piece,

Intermission followed, and
what had been a less than full
recital hull before, emptied out
even more. This was unfortunate.
for the second half of the
performance was really much
better than the first. It began with
a “Sonata for Violoncello and
Piano" by Claude Debussy.

The tightly-knit Prologue of
this work grew out of two
motives, the first introduced
immediately by the piano and the
second soon afterward by the
cello. The second movement, the
Serenade was really unusual, for
at times the cello imitated a
guitar, a mandolin. a tambourine
and a flute.

The Finale grew out of the
Serenade. Its folkish spirit was
interrupted midway by a very
mournful and downcast passage.
The air of optimism was restored
however, by a subsequent burst of
activity.

The last piece on the program
was a Sonata by Samuel Barber.
This so nata's greatest
characteristics were its
clear-flowing melodic lines and its
Very poignant harmonies. Both
Dr. Allen and Dr. Ghirudolln were
at their best in this piece.

Applause followed, and then an
encore, “Adagio and Rondo" by
Weber. After the performance,
cookies and punch were served in
the second floor lounge.

Don Crawford’s show proves
“you don’t have to look far”

by Raymond Katz

Seven forty-five. One spotlight
graces the fibre-glass curtains at
the underbelly of the Campus
Center Cafeteria. Off to the side, a
large Black man sits tuning a red
acoustic guitar, spitting out
chords and phrases between
adjustments. And around him sat
no more than 60 people,
meticulously sipping on their
plastic strawed cokes, underlining
their textbooks, and rapping
about old Tom Rush concerts.

Eight-o-five. A tall, solid Don
Crawford takes his seat, drenched
by white light. Sixty people. And
one performer. Together, sharing
a common emotional experience
within a milky white shelter.

Ten minutes of rapping, jokes,
stories, and explanations ensue.
Then the first song: “The New
Gospel Song." a rollicking,
hand-clapping number, more like
the foot-stomping music that
Koerner, Ray and Glover used to
do than gospel, but nonetheless
good, quick, moving and most of
all—joyful in all its sorrow. A
promise of things to come.

More rapping. Manna from
Heaven was really psychedelic
cactus. Moses was a cop on a
power trip. What would happen if
the Pope had to get a job? All this
to lead to Muddy Waters’
“Hoochie Koochie Man" (Didn’t
Mick Jagger write that song?").
Together. Straight forward, with
no phony squeals or meaningless
gutterul groans. A welcome
acoustical treatment of a blues
standard.

Next was Dylan's “Don’t Think
Twice, It’s All Right."
Remarkably done. A slow
sorrowful folk ballad, transformed
by voice and guitar into a
mournful bluesy wail. Mr.
Crawford can make a Jimmy Page
freak forget all about
amplification.

Next came a happy love song
("Since 1968, seven have been
written. I wrote four of them.")
to break up the concert‘s blues
base. An indian-influenced
instrumental follows, leading into
Leonard Cohen's “Susanne” (Just
close your eyes and listen. Sway
to the music. Don‘t think with the
music, think to it.) Then a song
about a weird lady from Ottawa
(“I fell in love with a lady who
smiles like the roses in
wintertime."). Then a jazzy piece
that leads you to expect the vibes,
bass, and drums to join in any
time. Beautiful. The influences of
Richie Havens peek through the
seams.

“Saturday, all alone by the sea,
missing somebody. And I'm
wondering if my somebody's
missing me?” Another Crawford
original. And the concert closes
with eight and a half minutes of

“The Midnight Train."
Amusement. And pure
entertainment.

For about an hour a small
group of students were treated to
Don Crawford's guitar and voice,
his words and emotions, his
feelings, and even still, a small
piece of his life. Sometimes I'm
puzzled as to why students can

In several ways, ABBEY ROAD
might not be considered a very
progressive album. At first it
appears to be merely a collection
of inconsequential compositions,
many of them revisiting the style
of past Beatle works.

But each time you listen to it
you notice more and more of the
details which make the album
worthy. Two definite redeeming
factors are “Because” and “Come
Together."

"Because" is a masterpiece of
flowing melody and mellow
harmony. The lyrics may not
seem much in themselves, but
perhaps it is their simplicity which
is the essence of their beauty. In
this way, it becomes a counterpart
of “Yesterday” and "I Will."

The most beautiful line in the
song has to be “Because the sky is
blue, it makes me cry.” One
misfortune is that this song is
dated by lyrical phrases such as
“turns me on” and “blows my
in .“

The best song on the album is
“Come Together." Its lyrics bear a
superficial resemblance to those
of “I Am a Walrus," but the song
as a whole is more similar to “Get
Back." The beat is slightly

syncopated, and is accented by
what sounds like the staccato
dialing of a telephone.

Also on this side is a song called
“Oh, Darling." It comes on like
early Dave Clark Five, but is
basically a much better song.

Some of the most beautiful
lyrics on the album are found in
“Something.” (“Something in
the way she knows, and all I have
to do is think of her. Something
in the things she shows me, I
don ‘t want to leave her now.")

There are three more songs
before you turn the record over.
“Octopus's Garden" Is Ringo‘s
slightly revised replica of “Yellow
Submarine."

“Maxwell‘s Silver l-Iammcr” is a
Rocky Raccoon-type
legend in-song which has a sort of
Salvation Army Band charm.

“I Want You” is the longest
song on the album. It starts out
very bluesy and eventually works

itself into a frenzy which is
abruptly cut off, ending the song
and the first side.

The second half of ABBEY
ROAD is a sampling of several
short tunes. They aren‘t too bad,
but few of them are major works.
They represent a sort of
retrospection into the “Rubber
Soul" Era, and are pieced together
like a film collage.

A smooth transition, for
example, is made betwen the soft
Spanish lyrics and
instrumentation of “Sun King" to
the bouncier, nonsensical “Mean
Mr. Mustard.“

"Golden Slumber" is a
well-performed lullaby moving
right into the heavier beat of
“Carry That Weight."

The album ends beautifully in
what is almost a perfect haiku:
“And in the end, the love you
take is equal to the love you
make."
