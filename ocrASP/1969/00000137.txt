by Bob Familant

On Wednesday, Coach Bill
Schiefflin’s varsity soccer team
met Hamilton College. State was
still looking for its first victory of
the season. The did not get it.

The Great Danes battled to a
1-1 tie in a game marred by cold,
wet and windy weather. The
Great Danes jumped out into the
lead on a first period goal by John
Proux. Hamilton tied the game In

the third period. it has been the
third period which has been the
Weak spot for the team all season.
The teams battled through two
scoreless overtimes in which the
State booters had many
opportunities, only to be stopped
by the fine play of the Hamilton
goalie. Cited for their fine play
were right Halfback ’l‘erry 'I‘rono
and goalie Terry Jordon. The
team record now stands at Owl-ll.

League I

by Mike Schweigert

A play-off between KB and
UFS will decide the fourth team
for the League one tournament.
Both teams have identical 3-3
records. The other three teams are
APA at 4-0-2, STB at 4-0-2, and
Potter at 4-2-0.

The tournament will be
round-robin; each of the four
teams will draw for position, with
the first playing the second and
the thirs playing the fourth. The
unofficial favorite going into the
contest will be STB, who‘Ve won
their last three in a row. APA,
unscored upon during the regular
season, will be hurt by having had
their final game of the season, nol
played because of a forfeit. It will
be up to their fine defense to stem
the momentum of STB.

On Monday, STB crushed TXO
44-0. Not only was this the
highest single game total, it was
two points more than the leading
offensive team (also STB) had
scored all season long. Scoring 2<l
points in the first half and 20
points in the second half, STB
controlled the ball so effectively
that ’I‘XO had the ball only 20
plays the whole game. The scores
came on a 20 yard run, an
interception, and passes of 40, 18,
25, 18, and 5 yards, and an
occasional PAT.

League II

by Jay Marshall

With two weeks remaining in
the regular League II season, at
least five teams are still in the
running for first place honors.
Defending champion ALC,
currently leads the pack with a
7-l record, however they are
closely followed by APA which is
6-101. Other teams with a shot
for first place include PTC, 6-2
GDX, 6-2 and Stumpy's Raiders
5~2-1. At the end of the season,
the top four teams will be
involved in a play off. The first
place team will meet the fourth,
and the second place squad will
play the third in the opening
round. The winners will meet for
the League championship. The
season has beem characterized by
the tight defenses used by the
winning teams which often shut
out their opponents. ALC has
displayed the most prolific
offense, usually scoring three
touchdowns a game.

Because of the balance in the
league, each team still has a
chance to take the championship.

League III

by Bruce Halcoff

League Ill football boasted
eight teams this year. All games
have been defensiVe battles. EEP,
with two games to play leads the
league with a 5‘0 record. In
second place stands State and
with a h-l shite. State's last game
is against EEP on Nov. 1, at '2
p.m. it should prove to be the
years big contest. KB, The Aces
and STB are tied for the third
sport, two games back. Behind
them in sixth, seventh and eighth
places respectaibcly are the
Commuters, The Group and the
Flying A.

At present League [II is
planning a round robin tourney to
be included in the over-all record
in determining the League's
champions. The top four teams
will participate. .  .

Defense Department research I

being conducted on conducto

by Jill Paznir

(Ed. note: Professor Corbett is one of the men
being ﬁnanced by the Department of Defense to
pursue his research project “Radiation Damage in
Semi-Conductors"—described as "Basic studies of
the effects produced in Silicon bombarded with
particle radiations produced in the laboratory. The
nature of the defects in the Silicon will be
established to determine the lifetime of
semi-conductors made from this material. The work
will make use of SUNYA’s new acceleralor." DoD
will also sponsor an international “Conference on
Radiation Effects in Semi~Conductors" managed by
Dr. Corbett. Please excuse layman ’s terminology.
necessitated by lack of knowledge on the par! of the
reporter.)

Q. What is a semiconductor?

A. There are metals and insulators; metals are good
conductors of electricity, insulators are not.
However, there are solid materials between these
extremes and they are termed semi-conductors.

Q. What is their usefulness?

A.They are used to produce transistors for radio,
TV'a, computer parts. They are also used to cull
power from the sun in space, to produce power
(voltage) in space (NASA uses big sheets in its space
satellites).

Q. Why would the Defense Department be
interested in them?

A. Regarding the defense department's mission, the
effects of a bomb going off near semi-conductors
would be relevant. They may find it useful in terms
of defense.

More broadly, science is the foundation on which
their technology is based. Sponsoring such projects
directly affects the progress of their own mission.

The health of the scientific effort contributes to
the defense department in terms of increasing basic
scientific knowledge upon which perhaps more
research can be done. Pure science is an area in
which a little knowledge goes a long way.

There is almost nothing one can do that cannot
be construed as contributing to the defense
department.

Q. How and who gets a defense department
contract?

A. I wrote a proposal describing the kind of research
I wanted to do. Then I determined the alternative
organizations who could support the research. There
are a number of places.

The National Science Foundation supports basic
scientific research, the Defense Department, NASA,
the AEC. I sent the proposal to the latter three,
omitting the NSF because they do not have much
money and I would be taking someone else's place
whose research might otherwise have been
supported.

1'8

Each of these organizations sponsor people for
their own purposes, their own mission. The project
however, would be the same for each of them.

The organization decides whether it is worth
supporting. They judge the quality and competence
of the research.

The next concern is one of cost effectiveness
which is measured using their own values.

Q. With whom, speciﬁcally, is the contract made?

A. This varies from university to university. SUNY
has a research foundation which accepts money for
contracts. They administer it and pass it on to
SUNY Albany where there is an office to which one
must account for expenditures. Accounts are signed
to authorize expenditures for the three grad
students receiving stipends for work on this project,
for instance.

The money comes without strings. There is no
one peering over my shoulder watching me work.
The law [Board of Trustees Guidelines] says that
there shall be no classified research on SUNY
campuses. All projects are public, publishable.This is
a great protection.

General Comments

Basic science before World War II was supported by
the Navy (in WW 1) creating the Ofﬁce of Naval
Research. The necessity for research became widely
apparent and after WW II the Defense Department,
among others, supported research projects. There
was a political struggle to see who would do what.

The National Science Foundation now receiver a
small fraction of the amount the government spends
on basic science. This includes Social Science and
physical science research.

If we had one giant NSF it would, in my opinion,
be a mistake. A monolithic bureaucracy,makes it
easy for one powerful man to prevent research he
may not. like for a number of reasons, personal,
political or otherwise. There are fads in science as in
anything else. Pluralism Pluralism of sponsors for
research more fully guarantees alternative sources of
ﬁnancial support.

There is a problem: is the money tainted or not?
There is the existence of a professional bias in all
ﬁelds by which the world is looked at through a
particular profession's perspective. The policeman
looks upon men as evil, to be contained by stong
law enforcement; the military man looks on people
as enemies.

There is civilian control within the Defense
Department bureaucracy They do represent Defense
Department interests. Co-optation does occur with
civilians, but. it is not complete. The Pentagon
bureaucracy and, more specifically, the legislative
and executive civilian control are important.

It is the seniority system in Congress that makes
the military as effective as it is. Mendel Rivers-he’s
the problem.

A good check and balance system would aid in
controlling the military. Where it is failing, we must
show it up. The idea is to build a society that will
keep us free from being influenced by “professional
bias."

Regarding the role of science in the society, it is
suggested that ten percent of the applied science
budget be used to research how to beat swords into
plowshares.

Greek Echo

by Mary Hart

 

As another year at Albany
begins the Greeks and their
existence are coming under
increasing criticism as to their
value and necessity on the
campus. Sororities and fraternities
are pictured by many as groups of
students organized for the sole
purpose of “having a good time."
Many also feel that these same
people disregard or ignore the
world outside their individual
groups-in other words, they have

orphans,

sorotities and fraternities sponsor
driVes and events for the Albany
community and other groups, e.g.
the clothing drives, parties for
blood
drives for the Cancer fund and for
the cause in Biafra.

At the same time, many Greeks
have become politically active in
campus, state, and local politics.

sororities and fraternities that are
politically active don't work as
Greeks, but these people, who
many claim to be just out for a
good time, are interested enough
in their environment to change it
and work for it. The main
purpose of this article is to try to
judge them on a less superficial
surface. For the most part the
Greeks are conscientious members

no social conscience.

Being a member of such a social
organinzation, I see the other, less
superficial side of the Greeks.
Granted, there are the “good
times" such as beer parties, kegs,
intramural sports, and
llomeeoming, but there is also a
lot of work and thought, both for
the sorority and fraternity, and
for the community. Each year the

SA already in debt

write-ins questioned

by Ken Stokem

Two new members were seated
on Central Council last night. Sue
Levey will be replacing the
retiring Barry Ross for
Community Programming
Commission. Ross had served on
Council for more than a year.

Dr. Melvin Urofsky also
officially became a member of
Council. He is the second of five
faculty members to be appointed
by President Kuusisto. The other
faculty member is Dr. Thompson
Littlefield.

A small controversy flared
briefly over a question brought up
by Election Commissioner
Jeanette Beckerman, on write-ins
in the Faculty Senate Elections. It
seems that in one case a person
whose legal name was on the
ballot, also had his nickname
written in several times by people
who didn’t know his legal name.

In the other case a person was
waging a write-in campaign under
a nickname and had both his
nickname, Uncle Dave, and his
real name written in. In this case
it was questioned as to whether or
not the two names should be
counted as one.

Council decided by a 19-2-1
vote that in both cases the
nicknames and the legal names of
both would be counted as one. It
was suggested that Council would
soon consider a bill to clarify this

situation should it occur again.
Finance Committee informed
Council that Student Association
is already running approximately
$14,500 in the red and cautioned
Council on further expenditures.
Ten of the eleven members of
Finance Committee were
announced last night and were
approved by a vote of 11-0-13.
The members are: Ralph
DiMarino, chairman, Lenny Kopp,
Bert Eversley, Gary Gould, Jean
Turner, Tim Keely, Bob
Bernstein, Dick Wesley, Carol

Several other people were also
appointed by Council with a vote
of 5-144. They were:

Margery Keough. University

Gould and Kathy Blotnick.
