“Royal Hunt” opens

tomorrow

British playwright Peter Shaffer
chose to tell the tale of the demise
of a people in his play, THE
ROYAL HUNT OF THE SUN,
which he subtitles “A Play
Concerning the Conquest of
Peru." The play opens tomorrow
night in the new University
Performing Arts Center.

At the core of this drama,
which depicts the clash of two
cultures in the mid-1530's, is the
historical confrontation of two
indomitable leaders: the Spanish
Conquistador Francisco Pizarro,
played by Peter Hasler, and the
Inca god-king Atahuallpa, played
by Gary Restifo.

The empire of Atahuallpa
possesses an abundance of a metal
after which the Spaniards
lust—gold. Pizarro’s relationship
with Atahuallpa, his prisoner,
develops from one of man against
god into trust and faith between a
man of truth and power, who
truly may be “god on earth," and
a broken soldier.

But true to the violence and
hypocrisy of the early Christian
missionary efforts in the New
World, the Spaniards kill
Atahuallpa and defeat his "pagan"
people for gold, in the name of
their God. The victory of the
Spanish army against the Incas
can only be subordinate to the

Reynolds’

lends catharsis to

by Ali Hazzah

On Friday, October 24,
Experimental Theatre presented
Michael Reynold's adaptation of
Gogol's DIARY OF A MADMAN.
Performances took place at 8 p.m.
and 10 p.m. Both were
stariding-rcom-only

The play is about a lonely
Russian clerk (Reynolds) who
falls in love with his boss's
daughter (Mary Carney).
Rejected, he goes insane.

To keep DIARY from falling
into bathos, Reynolds maintained
strict control over his part. The
clerk's moods, anecdotes, and
moments of terror and misery
were played, necessarily, in away
that the audience could
appreciate, empathize, and
hopefully identify with. Any false
move, and Reynold's spell would
have broken~for the clerk is
pathetic; yet he is also universal.

DIARY‘s total harmony was
enhanced by the lighting effects
and stage design. Having an amber
spotlight on the daughter, we
realize how she is unique to the
clerk. His empty room ls pushed
back Into darkness and forgotten,
as he adores and tries to reach the
untouchable.

And time goes on. The bells
continue tolling, and the music
plays, threatening. The clerk's
world suddenly collapses around
hlrn. His delusions are shattered;
he has nothing to be anymore but
the king of Spain.

"What strange customs this
land has!" he cries. Even in an
asylum he finds no sympathy. He
has committed the biggest crime
of all: rebelling against his
condition, he tried to be
something other than what an

The evening began with a
whimper-an unforseeable
60-minute delay. The audience
demonstrated good manners by
not becoming rude but sat
patiently waiting for Miss
Warwick.

Following the swift and
succinct announcing of the new
Homecoming Queen, the
"Constellations" harmonized the
soul-standard “Get Ready" and
the Broadway classic “Sunrise,
Sunset." The "Constellations"
proved far superior to what I had
expected. Being Miss Warwick's
fillvin group, they managed
without trouble to surpass many
entertainers State previously has
hosted.

Their accompanying music was
somewhat loud, but this did not
distract from their graceful
dancing and soul singing. The
"Constellations" set the pace by
creating an anxious mood for the
upcoming Miss Warwick.

Miss Warwick slowly walked
from off stage to her platform,

of “Alfie” produced a mellow

“You've Lost That Loving

expounded her sincerity as a
performer.

The only complaint I have is
that after waiting patiently for an
hour I feel Mias Warwick should
have performed longer than the
45 minutes she actually sang. This
does not alter the fact that State
has never seen a more beautiful,
more talented, more sincere
individual than Miss Warwick. She
was aided by four professional
musicians who did an excellent
job of accompaniment.

Entering the world of Warwick
was aided especially by her
impressive pianist, whose
smooth-flowing notes enticed the
audience.

“College audiences are very
receptive," said Miss Warwick.
I"I‘hey come for a concert, not for

Candlelight Tales:

An ASP Feature

by Ishmael Malowitz

The night of the candle light
march from Draper Hall tothe
Capitol, I suggested to three of
my fellow marchers that we each
tell a tale to make our downtown
pilgrimage more pleasant. I
promised to reward the narrator
of the best tale with a free Walt‘s
sub and a bottle of Pepto Bismol.
Unfortunately, due to lack of
space, I can only set down on
paper one tale. Sincethe Sorority
Sister's soory is far too obscene
even for the ASP (perhaps with
the kind graces of the editors an
expurgurated version can appear
next week) and since the
ﬁnancially needy student, who
secured a three dollar per hour job
through the work study program,
only completed half his tale (he
left the march, as we passed the
downtown Flah‘s , to buy another
sport jacket, silk tie, and bell
bottom trousers so that he could
appear well dressed as he did his
homework begind the

More Kuusisto

continued from page 3

Concerning possible future
construction at SUNYA, President
Kuusisto stated that even though
planning was being done for a
west academic extension and a
field house, there were real
problems concerning money
appropriations for these. He did
however, express hope that Indian
Quad will be ready for occupancy
by the next academic year.

President Kuuisisto also made
several announcements at the
conference. He said that he had
met with the student
representatives to the [faculty
Senate and believed that many
constructive results would come
from their participation. But, he
also said, that this in no way
should limit the effectiveness of
the student government.

USHIN G WHERE?

I will repeat the tale told by the
Fraternity Brother.
Frat Brother's Tale

The President of Interfraternity
Council began the semi-annual
Interfraternity Choker with his
semi-annual speech. After telling
us that fraternity rushing is an
inane (he meant "innate") part of
University life and wishing us
good luck and good lushing (I
think he reant rushing), I looked
over the list of the nine
fraternities in my rush book iind
their functions immediately
following the Choker.

Apple Pie Apple was sponsoring
a blood drive at Albany Medical
Center, while Beta Vic Looper
was holding an election. Krappa
Beta, We R. Potted Club, Sigma
Omega Beta (known as SOB by
friend and enemies alike), Theta
High Omega, and Up Your Sig
were all sponsoring beer parties.
The two State Quad Fraternities
were showing stag films in the
Tower East Cinema.

After careful consideration, I
decided to attend the Sigma
Omega Beta beer party, held in
some suspicious looking
apartment ovor the Central Artms
Bar. As I signed the rush book,
the pleggemastcr thrust a paper
cup of beer into my hands. I soon
discovered that those drinking
from paper cups were rushees like
myself; the brothers held mugs
handsomer engraved with the
letters "SOB."

It took me quite some time to
realize that SOB stood for Sigma
Omega Beta. How could I go
home wearing a jacket
monogrammed with SOB? The
neighbors would tiilk. After
downing a considerable quantity
of beer, I passed out in a state of
drunken exhaustion. Upon
regaining consciousness, l was
reassured that I had definitely
earned an invitation to formal
rush.

balckball power, I received a bid
one momentous Sunday between
the hours of 7 pm and 9 pm in the
Campus Center Assembly Hall.,
The bast part of the day occurred
between 2 pm and 9 pm, when
quiet hours forbade me to speak
with any member of the frat I had
rushed.

The following day pledging
began. One night I delivered a
speech in the Colonial Quad
dining room on the advantages of
lifing in Troy. The dollowing day
I patrolled the academic podium
with a “God Bless Nixon"
placard. That night I cleaned the
beer bottles out of Psi Gamma's
lounge area, dressed in a girls’ gym
suit. The following night I was
kidnapped and brought to
Washington Park whereupon I
proceeded to get mugged by two
St. Rose freshmen.

Hazing culminated the several
weeks of pledging. Here, however,
I am sworn to secrecy. At the
conclusion of the initation rites,
the President of the Frat patted
me on my dislocated back, shook
my broken hand, and called me
“brother.”

I was deeply touched.
