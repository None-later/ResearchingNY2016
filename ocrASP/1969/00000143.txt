RYM II rallies against war,

and indecent housing

by Howard Schlossberg

Regional traveler Dave Maxwell
of the Revolutionary Youth
Movement II, met with students,
yesterday interested in taking part
in R.Y.M. 11 activities in the
Albany area.

Maxwell explained that R.Y.M.
II is an organization not only
dedicated to ending the war in
Vietnam (as Student Mobilzation
is) but also is aimed at ending
racism and inspiring a revolution

of the proletariat based on
Marxist and Leninist preachings.
II is currently a

minority branch of S.D.S. but an
upcoming convention of R.Y.M.
II in Louisville. Kentucky could
change all that. At this gathering
R.Y.M.“ will officially decide
what its exact aims and methods
will be.

In the way of community
action. R.Y.M. II wants to bring
the issues to the people. Maxwell
is working with Black Panthers in
the area and yesterday helped
organize a rally to be held today
in downtown Albany in order to
expose indecent housing and
supply breakfast food for
children. The rally meets at l2:30
at Draper Hall and moves
downtown.

Outside of the Black Panthers,
Maxwell also works closely with :1

Apollo 11:

group of Puerto Ricans known as
Young Lords.

Maxwell is currently a Graduate
student of Chemistry at Cornell
University He was formerly only
semi-active in S.D.S. activities.
With the formation of RYM,
Maxwell has been concentrating
his efforts on RYM activities
including rallies,
community-action activities and
meetings such as yesterday's all
over this region.

With regard to community
action, RYM II is trying to

DeGaulle’s fall and

French

by Perry Silvennan

Pierre Emanuclli, expert on
French politics and foreign policy,
provided an insight into Charles
DeGaullc’s political downfall and
trends in French politics in a
speech delivered here Wednesday
afternoon. DeGaulle’s collapse
indicated a desire by the French
electorate for a change in that
nation's world role.

Although President DcGaulle’s
supporters won a vast majority of
seats in the French National
Assembly in the June 1968

A retrospective view

by Carol Rosenberg

The Forensics Union will
sponsor the ﬁrst of eight audience
debates on Friday, Nov. 8. The
debate, to take place at 7:30 pm.
in the Assembly Hall of the
Campus Center, will involve a
SUNYA team and members of the
Philippines Debate team. The
National Organization chooses a
top team to travel around the
country meeting various schools
on their circuit.

The visitors, Antonio C.
Pastelero, a 24 year old senior at
the College of Law at the
University of the Philippines and
Fernando (Jerry) T. Barican, 20
years old and a student of the
university have been those chosen
to do this.

Both visitors have had a great
deal of experience. Mr. Pastelcro
as a debater, judge and coach has
been awarded membership on the
National Champion Team of the
Republic of the Philippines, the
best debater award at the
University and twice received the
President Marco’s trophy. Mr.

Board (Formerly l..A.A C
Judicial) has 3 openings for
freshmen and seniors. If you are
interested please send your name,
address, telephone number, class
year, and reason for application to
Kenneth Kurzwcil, Stuyvesant
Tower, Box HT 9021.

Barican is president of his student
council and can be considered an
opponent of the war in Viet Nam.

The topic chosen, uThis House
believes that Apollo 11 should not
have been undertaken,” will be
afﬁrmed by the Philippines, while
the SUNYA team will negate the
statement. Defending the Apollo
program for SUNY will be
Stratton Rawson, a senior here at
Albany, who is majoring in
English. He has been a college
debater for 4 years now and been
up against visitors in the past,
notedly the British team.

Political science major Douglas
Goldschmidt, a junior, will also be
defending for SUNY. Doug is a
former member of Central
Council, a 3rd year college
debater, and belongs to DSRTKA
(National Forensics Honorary).

After the initial presentations,
the audience will be allowed to
participate. This new form of
debate involving the audience will
enable them to ask questions and
offer answers on the subject.

This will then be followed by
an infomial gathering for coffee
and cake.

bring their “beefs” out in open
and relate this to anti-war
sentiments.

RYM II is also trying to get
active in the General Electric

leaders who are often unreliable
according to Maxwell) and the
rank and ﬁle workers at the plants
who are out on strike by
organizing a rally on campus on
behalf of the strikers and taking
up a strike fund collection.

politics

.ections, he chose to call for a
referendum on the issue of
redistricting France instead of
having this proposal passed
through the Assembly.

The majority of “No” votes

cast brought DeGaullc’s
retirement from politics. Mr.
Emanuelli explained this

referendum as an attempt by
DcGaulle to have the public
approve all his policies in ratifying
this proposal ofhis government in
early 1969.

However, dissatisfaction with
his policy toward Israel and
apprehension created by the
invasion of Czechoslovakia, were
the major factors that brought
DeGaulle’s defeat. Indicated here
were the sympathy of Frenchmen
with the Israeli cause and a desire
for closer relations with the
United States and NATO III the
face of the Czechoslovakia crisis.

Mr. Emanuaili indicated that
the subsequent election of
DeGaulle’s former Prime Minister
Georges Pompidou showed the
desire by the French electorate to
keep the same working political
framework without DcGaulle.

The new foreign policy of the
Pompidou government showed,
according to Emanuaili, an
“opening” toward Europe and an
abandonment of the elevated
world role planned for France
through Gaullist visions of
grandeur. This is shown in the
permissiveness of the new French

government toward British
membership in the Common
Market.

The Pompidou government is
also attempting to create closer
relations with the Univted States.
Emanuelli stated, in relation to
the French policy toward Israel
that'the ban on arms sales to that
nation were still official: however,
he said that there were “leaks in
the wall."

American Red Cross on
treatment of prisoners

The American Red Cross urged
a massive expression of
indignation over the treatment of
US. prisoners held b y the North
Vietnamese. It called on the
American people to write direct
to the president of the
Democratic Republic of North
Vietnam to express concern about
Hanoi's failure to give captured
US. military personnel the
benefits of the Geneva
Conventions.

According to latest Department
of Defense ﬁgures, 413 Americans
are known to be prisoners of war
and 918 others are missing and
believed captured.

Pointing out that the North
Vietnamese are signatory to the
Geneva Conventions, Red Cross
national headquarters here said
such a public outcry might do
much to ensure that American
prisoners will receive the humane
treatment called for in the

Conventions. It urged that appeals
be addressed to:

Office of the President,
Democratic Republic of North
Vietham, Hanoi, North Vietnam.

An airmail letter weighing less
than one-half ounce takes 25
:ents postage, the Red Cross said.

Meanwhile, the American Red
Cross is continuing to urge Red
Cross societies in all parts of the
world to intcrcede in behalf of the
US. prisoners with the Red Cross
Society of North Vietnam and to
ask that their respective
governments take similar action
with the North Vietnamese
government. I

The Geneva Conventions call
for all prisoners to be promptly
identiﬁed; afforded an adequate
diet and medical care; permitted
to communicate with other
prisoners and the “exterior;"
promptly repatriated if serioust
sick or wounded; and at all times
be protected from abuse
