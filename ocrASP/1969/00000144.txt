“R al Hunt 0 the

by Richie Matturro

ROYAL HUNT OF THE SUN,
the State University Theatre’s ﬁrst
production of the season, is an
uneven drama which in its heights
reaches intense tragedy,l and in its
depths sinks to sustained
boredom.

Ostensively, it is the story of
Pizarro’s conquest of Peru, and, as
Shakespeare does in his histories,
playwright Peter Shaffer portrays
that event as if it were the result

of interplay and clashes between.

individuals, notably Pizarro and
Atahuallpa, the emperor of the
Incas.

Although Spain has lofty goals
in sending the expedition to the
New World (they will exchange
with the pagans Christ for gold),
Pizarro himself never rationalizes
or deludes himself about his
actions. He sees the paradise in
which the Incas live, and he
knows that the Spanish will
corrupt rather than enlighten the
simple Indians.

Pizarro‘s motives for conquest
are enigrnatical. l-Ie cares little for
the gold, less for the governorship,
and though he thinks at one point
it is fame he desires, it is really the
immortality connected with fame
that he seeks.

He finds that immortality in
Atahuallpa, son of the sun, god on
earth. Pizarro captures this
immortal emperor-god and
promises to free him if he ﬁlls the
throne room with gold. But
before the task is complete, a
strange friendship develops
between the old SJaniard and the

 

general, will have all Pizarrd’s
greatly outnumbered company

brown, young god, and this is the
heart of the drama.

The general must decide
whether to keep his promise and
free Atahuallpa, or to
treacherously kill him. Should
Pizarro honor his agreement,
Atahuallpa, though sparing the

  

killed for the murder of three
thousand Incas. Pizarro’s whole

career as a general and conqueror
rebels against this. But should he

There are only two characters in
the play, Pizarro and Atahuallpa.
De Soto is just a sounding board
for the general; the priests are
only personified voices of the
Church; and even the narrator, the
now aged man who was Pizarro’s
squire on the expedition. is

    
   

 

one-sided and without depth. This
paucity of characters robs the
play of much of its interest, for
any notable action which is to
take place can only occur when
both Pizarro and Atahuallpa are
present. There is a lull in the
drama whenever one of them is
offstage.

Because of this fact the whole

of the extremely long first act is
almost devoid of interest and
might have been compressed into
a scene or two. The essential
action of the play cannot begin
until Atahuallpa’s character is
developed, which is not until the
second act. It is a serious failing in
a drama when half the play could
be dispensed with for being
nonessential to the plot.

THE EVOLUTION OF CINEMA

. by Tom Quilley

 

SPIRITS OF THE DEAD,
based loosely upon three tales by
Edgar Allen Poe, is not the
cohesive triptych of evil it was
intended to be. It degenerates into
a disjointed trilogy of bowdlerizcd
‘Poc that would amount to

nothing if it weren’t for the‘

updated mini~masterpiecc
contributed by Fredrico Fellini.

Roger Vadim’s interpretation

acting and phallic symbolism.

nudity of his carlicr films by
“refining” it to the level of
“oh-so-chic" erotica of the
sado-masochistic variety.
Unfortunately his preoccupation
with his wife‘s cleavage has
nothing to do with Poe’s original
intent.

Miss Fonda’s insipid over-acted
non-acting seems more
embarassing with each new
exposure, dramatic or otherwise.
Although the scenes of her
growing obsession for the raven
black stallion are generally well
done, the arty photography does
nothing to elevate this episode
from the depths of undisciplined
drivel. This ﬁlm finally separates
the exhibitionist frorii the artist in
Roger Vadim. One can only
conclude that Vadini is no artist.

Louis Malle’s presentation of
WILLIAM WILSON is a bit riiorc
Iiteratc but stiff and
over-produced. Mallc succeeds in
rendering an instantaneous visual
representation of Wilson, a
rampant id pursued throughout
his life by the supercgu, more
persuasively than Poe’s vague
characterization. The use of the
confessional as a transitional
device from original story to
screen adaption, is ti convincing
media for exposing Wilson‘s gilt as
well as instituting the flashback
sequences.

Yet Mallc's greatest error is his
pathetic choice of principals.
Alain Delon as Wilson is incrcly ti
flawless facade dripping with
sexual charisma and no convincing
emotion. Brigctlc Btii'dot looks
more absurd than alluring in a
black wig chomping on that stogic
hclwccn IICI' poiiting lips, llcr
customary emptiness is
:tccciiliiatcd by lici irritating
sullcn scdtictivcncss that docs

more to tIIIL‘IItIIL‘ than tittllatc.

The poor dubbing contributes
to the ruin of the generally sound
technical aspects of the
production, expecially the sharp,
colorful cinematography. For all
its literal dedication, this film
turns into it baroque clutter of

ornate production values and
empty characterizations. These
cumulative undermining effects

subatoge the entire ﬁlm which
fails to do justice to I’oc's original
theme. In the end Wilson not only
kills himself but Mnllc succeeds in
killing both Wilson and I’oc.

Fredrico Fcllini understands
Poe. The metaphysical insanity in
TOBY DAMMIT comes tlic
closcsl to Poe‘s depiction of the
decaying psyche. Fclliiti utilizes
the original premise and characlcr
but expands it into it modern
psycho-drama of lialluciruition
and horror. ilc ﬂoods the scrccn
Willi his particular brand of
hilarious \tiL'Iill \tIIIIL‘ and
symbolic puns :is 'l'oby is
propcllcd toward the final abny
of paranoia with his own personal
vision of Satan waiting to collect
his head,

Terence Slump gives a
superlatch pcrformance as
Dammit. a Sliakcspearian actor
with alcoholic motivation coerced
by economic considerations into
starring in what is described as
Italy’s first Catholic western.

Dammit is a walking cadaver who
repudiates God but embraces a
vision of the devil as a little girl in
a white dress with flowing blonde
hair. Stamp’s physical demeanor
and haunted, half-drunken
movements are morbidly
convincing as he approaches the
totality of madness.

Fellini's vision is a bit more
Freudian than Poe‘s brit their
purposes are IIIIkC. He uses a
Ferrari as Toby's means of escape
front mounting social and
psychological prcssurcs and as a
final confrontation with the dead
ends of his mind. Fellini’s unique
visual style of conglomerate
surreal images and bizarre
overlapping shots are as calctilatcd
as Poe‘s language. They both
prcscnt Toby as tllt obsessed and
driven titan attempting to defy
but ultimately yielding to the
poucrs of Satan and insanity.

ITL‘IIIIII has successfully nuippcd
llic .ll‘tL‘l'ltllItillS of tlic IIlIllLl in his
past films and be lit” surpasses his
competitors in the t‘cprcscntation
of mental degeneration.

Fellini is a inctiipliysician who
understands tltc natures of evil
and corruption not tinlikc the
transcendentiilist Poe. Therefore
he inftiscs the essential artistic
quality that saves this overall
lifeless film from becoming a
completely dead spirit.
