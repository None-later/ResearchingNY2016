CSTB Crushes APA,15s0

by Mire Sehweigert

On Tuesday afternoon, STB
destroyed APA’s perfect season
with a 15-0 victory. Previous to

this game, APA had a record of make the playoffs
four wins and two ties,and hadn’t . ' ‘ ' ' '
given up a single point, or lost a \

game in two years. STB, the
leading offensive team in the
leauge, came into the game with a
similar four win-two tie record;
their defense had given up only
six points. One of the key factors
in the game was the momentum
of STB, who won their last three
regular season games vs. APA’s tie
and win by forfeit. STB could not
be stopped from scoring, and
whenever they were threatened
the defense came up with the big
play.

In other action, KB, which had
earned a berth in the playoffs by
beating UFS 6-2, tied Potter 66.
It's ﬁtting that the game turned
out as a tie—both teams were
evenly matched; erratic and
inconsistent, neither team was
able to capitalize on the other‘s
mistakes or produce the “big”
play needed for a victory.

ln League ll action, APA
defeated injury-riddled
Sophomore Tide by a 20-0 score
to move into a ﬁrst place tie with
defending champ ALC.

Meanwhile, PFC missed several
opportunities to score and
consequently ended up in a
scoreless tie with GDX. The latter
remain in second place, one point
behind the co-leaders while PFC is
third. two points behind.

Stumpy’s Raiders, the ﬁfth team

’in contention for the

championship is four points
behind but still has a fine shot to.

 

in League lll, all eyes are
focusing on the big game of the
year, Saturday, when Potter goes
up against State Quad for ﬁrst
place.

 

Today, STB manhsndled Potter, 18-0.

Stickmen Edge RPI, 9-8

by Andy Egol

The Albany State Varsity
Lacrosse team travelled to R.P.l.
on Wednesday and did what seems
to come naturally for them. The
Dane stickmen, who were rated
number 70 in the NCAA. ratings
last season, defeated R.P.l. (the
number 30 team in the ratings) by
a score of 98.

Over the past two seasons,
when Lacrosse was only a club
sport at this University, the
stickmen have lost only one game
and tied one.

The scoring power that the
stickmen have shown in the past
will be around again this season.
Leading the scori ng for the Danes
was Larry Smith with four goals.
Also scoring were Mikc Barlottn
with two goals, Steve Jakway with
two markers. and transfer student
John Wilcox with one. Starting at
the midfield positions were Tom
Mullin. Mike Golub. and John
Wilcox.

Tom Ostcrman did an excellent
job at defense and was backed up
by the sticks of George Torow.
Barry Kolstein and Kurt Smith.

State completely cominated the
contest in which it posted its ﬁrst
win this season against three ties
and five losses. The Danes were
neger out of any of these
encounters save a 5-0 loss to
powerful RPl. The team’s basic
strength can be seen by the fact
that they defeated Union College
in a preseason scrimmage and last
week, Union defeated RPI in a big
upset, 1-0.

Coach Schieffelin’s hooters
started quickly, scoring two goals
in the first quarter and taking that
lead to the dressing room at the
half. Brooklyn could not seem to
get untracked and found It
extremely difficult to pierce the
State defense, scoring its only goal
in the last quarter after Coach
Schieffclin had taken out some of
his starters, with a 5-0 lead on the

oard.

Leading the Danc‘s attack was
forward Demetrios Micheal with
two goals while senior Lew
Rahler. George Kelcshian and
sophomore John Proulx scored
one each. Joel Volinski and
sophomore Steve Backus played
their usually fine games on
defense while Terry Jordan made
I] saves in the ﬁrst half before
John Thayer took over the

Rich Margison, former
All—American basketball player at
the University, has been invited to
play for the new independent
professional team in Albany. The
team will play Eastern League
clubs and other independent and

than a dozen socring marks at
Albany before graduating in June.

No wonder Genesee is just a little more
exciting than any other beer.

Why is a beer drinker
interested in water?

Good water is the heart” of great beer. That’s why
Genesee Beer uses crystal-clear Hemlock Lake, fed
by underground springs and mountain streams, as
its basic water source. Then Genesee Beer filters
this crisp, cold water once, twice, three times.
The result? Pure water to bring you pure
enjoyment in a sparkling, lively beer that’s
actually purer than water from your tap.

We’ll do anything to bring you better beer

Last spring, for the ﬁrst time at
Albany, an award was given to a
fraternity for outstanding service
to the community and the
university and was sponsored by
the Inter-Fraternity Council. The
brothers of Alpha Pi Alpha were
recognized as most worthy for
this award of “Fraternity of the
Year.”

In order to receive this award, a
fraternity must achieve certain
goals, both on the campus and in
the community. Within the
university the members should
exhibit general participation in
campus activities. For example,
they should participate
enthusiastically in sports, both
intramural and intermural.

The brothers should also exert
some leadership in student
government and the running of
student affairs. Finally, in order
to receive recognition, the
fraternity and its members should
also show academic achievement.

Community affairs should also
play a large part in the activities
of the fraternity. As an individual
fraternity brother, involvement
and service to the community
include volunteer work in
orphanages and hospitals,
donating blood, etc.

Sponsoring of blood drives and
working with the community in
several service projects to improve
conditions of that community
should also be a major goal of the
fraternity as a whole.

Not only lFC but many other
groups, on and off campus, feel
that Alpha Pi Alpha fraternity
best fulfills the standards as the
ideal fraternity. The goals
outline'l above are felt to be best
represented by the brothers of
Alpha Pi Aloha.

The members of ISC-IFC. as
well as the members of the
individual fraternities and
sororities extend to APA sincere
congratulations for the award of
“Fraternity of the Year.“

Beta Beta Beta
“slam session”

Last Thursday night, the
Biology Club along with the
co-sponsorship of Beta Beta Beta,
held its student-faculty “slam
session." In the planning for
several weeks, the event was a
great success. With all chairs
removed from the biology lounge.
the students confronted an eager
to hear faculty on an equal level.
Discussed, were topics such as
improvement of presently offered
courses arid the possible initiation
of several new course. The evening
proved proﬁtable to all who came,
and both the faculty and students
alike expressed their desire for
another confrontation, probably
to be held next semester.

To the Students:

Tuesday’s ASP reported a “historic” meeting of
University Senate, in which we, the
newly-elected undergraduate Senators,
“participated” in for the ﬁrst time. BULLSHIT. The

Frustrating. 'I‘hat's what it's like 'to be a cop

rotten for us to do. Then we isolate him. Fight him.
Ignore him. And it‘s getting worse. the

Those who spit at: cops say they are right, and
most deserve some respect because they
whole-heartedly believe themselves to be in the
right. Well a cop believes in himself too. He believes
that his job has got to be done and his motives are
also true.

We may not agree with what another human
believes in, but let's give some respect where respect
is due.

appeasement. The combination of a two-thirds
voting majority and the use of parliamentary
chicanery succeeded in stiﬂing even the opinions of
the Student Senators.

Twenty minutes were spent discussing parking
regulations, and only thirty were used to “debate”
the asinine pass-fail bill that was unfortunately
enacted. One Doctor Eson stated that since this
changein grading would have absolutely no effect
upon the University, and because the faculty had to
go home to eat dinner, THEY decided to cut off
debate and pass the bill, just to get the hell out of
there!

Not until we have a 50-50 student-faculty ratio,
and we elect students who represent the entire
student body instead of the co-opted clowns
presently in ofﬁce, will your feelings be channelled
into the structure of your school.

In peace,

Deathly Concerned

Since killing and death are a matter of such deep
concern, how about reading off the names of the
individuals killed in trafﬁc accidents: 53,100 in
l967; 55,250 in 1968, not to mention the
3,900,000 injured. (Viet Nam dead numbered
33.630 as of April 1.1969.) In the past 68 years we
have had more highway deaths than total war
:asualties, combat and noncombat, incurred in all
our wars starting with and including the Revolution!
The automobile is the number one killer of college
and high-school age people -- not wars.

Death holds the same ﬁnality no matter whence

it comes, and traffic accidents are no more Jack L. Schwartz
