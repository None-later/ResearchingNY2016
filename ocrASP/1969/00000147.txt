ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

byRobuthner

Last Fri-lay afternoon, Dean
Fred Tickn r of the Graduate
School of Public Affairs lectured
informally at Sayes Hall on the
future of imperialism.
Approximately 25 graduate
students participated in the
hour-and-a-half discussion.
Afterwards, the discussion broke
down into smaller groups.

The Dean opened with a short
history of imperialism. Western
Europe ﬁrst exploited the Far
East in the pursuit of spices,
which were vital for the
preservation of food. The early
imperialists did not intend to
occupy the territories that they
were robbing. Gradually out of
 necessity, imperialismt became a
political and social force that
intervened in Asian and African
affairs.

“Perfect, unﬂawcd, balanced
 an awe-msplrmg venture”

An ASP Satire by IknnisWhitdmI

The press conference was a little late in getting
started. Advance notice had been

skimpy: all President Richard Noskin had said was
that he had commissioned one of America’s leading
architects to design a mammoth 100,000-student
National University of the United States to be
located (for one reason or another) at Yorba Linda,
California, and that the chosen architect was an
innovator in university planning. Two students from
the State University of Nelson Rockyfellow at
Albany, fearing the worst (for one reason or
another), were on hand to witness the event.

There was a general murmur as the President,
followed by the ever-popular Vice-President
Spirochete Agnu, marched down the center aisle
from the back of the room. Mr. Agnu took his
accustomed seat just to Mr. Noskin's right, as the
President strode up to the microphone and began:

“Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you are all
aware that I have commissioned an exceptional
architect to design the magniﬁcent National
University of the United States, to be located (for
obvious reasons) in Yorba Linda, California. He is
here today to present his model to you and the
nation, and to answer any questions which you may
have about this awe-inspiring undertaking. I give
you Mr. Edward Droolstone."

The President seated himself at his
Vice-President‘s left as Edward Droolstone. nattily
attired in a black and white striped suit with a
flrriring white collar, emerged from a side door and
faced the ncwsrncn. The students from SUNRA
sank low in the seats.

“My friends,“ began the architect, “our President
requested the to create it university which would
stand as it monument for great nation. A bastion of
education and lcarning, as I would put it. And what
greater means to express the soaring pride our
country feels fro the intellect titan through
symmetry! Perfect, unilnwcd, balanced symmetry!"
Thundcrous applause rocked the room.

“My assistants are now passing otrt photographs
of my already famous State University of Nelson
Rockyfellow ill Albany. As you see, it is not a
pcrfcct university." .

A reporter in the front spoke up, “Why is it not
pcrfcct, Mr. Droolstonc? It looks ﬁne to mc." Cries
of ztgrccmcnl were echoed by all btrt two of the
others prcscnl.

“Because, sir, upon close examination you will

me an unpaired extension off the Academic
Podium. This is the Campus Center. There is also an
unpaired gumnasiu, inﬁrmary, central heating
building, and polluted lake. The roadway around
the school is not a perfect oval, and the spire in the
middle of the podium is off to one side."

“What do you propose to alleviate this condition,
Mr. Droolstone?"

“i have effected the symmetrical arrangement so
lacking at the Albany complex via the following:
four inﬁnnaries, four central heating buildings, four
gymnasia, four lakes, and a symmetrical oval road
enclosing the campus."

One of the SUNRA students rose and spoke out
with a tinge of hope in his voice, “Your design is
still failing, Mr. Droolstone. Perfect symmetry in
unattainable. I defy you to balance the Campus
Center and the chiming phallic symbol on the
podium. You'll have to settle for another
assymmetric campus."

A sea of angry faces swung around toward the
offender. Vice—President Agnu came to his feet
menacineg and muttered something about “effetc
snobs," but was immediately restrained by a touch
on his arm from his leader.

Droolstone, visibley ruffled by the attack,
indignantly adjusted the arches supporting his collar
and declared:

“0n the contrary, my young friend, I have met
with success. The National Univcrsity will feature
four Academic Podia and living complexes, such as
what is found singly at SUNRA, located at the four
corners of the campus. At their ccntcr will be a
Central Academic Podium, replete with living
complexes, which shall be four timcs as big as the
fotrr surrounding it. l.c., the towers on the central
quandranglc will be 88 stories tall and the academic
buildings will consist of 12 stories above ground and
4 below.

There will be four levels of lecture rooms. There
will be two SUMMETRICAL, I say, ‘Centcrs ofthc
Campus Ccntcrs’, ﬂanking a majestic lQOO-foot high
plrnl er, spire, located art the exact geometric center
of the campus, having a fountain at its zenith
shooting a column of water an additional 300 feet
into the air. That, my skeptical friend, is
symmetry!"

Likc all good parents, the ncwsmcn cheered and
thought the plan for the symmetric campus was
indccd wonderful. The two students subsequently
transferred to chsscltcclmic Polytutc Instilacr in
nearby assymmetric Troy.

W
Future of Imperialism safe

This. intervention quite often led
to outright colonization, therby
prostrating many underdeveloped
nations at the mercy of the white
man, chiefly, the English, French,
and Dutch. It was not until the
Spanish-American War that the
United States Government turned
its hungry eyes out to the world.
Dean Tickner characterized
American and Russian imperialism
as land expansionist in contrast to
the overseas territories of England
and France.

Tickner sees England's present
Commonwealth system as a viable
alternative to her “white man’s
burden" policy of the past
century. It is worthwhile for
Britain’s old colonies to remain
with the Commonwealth. But the
Dean is remorse over the reality
that although the poor nations
might be getting richer, the rich
nations are increasing their wealth
at a greater pace than the former.

It is commonly thought that
Caesar favored Cleopatra out of
love. Actually, Rome was in dire
need of food to feed her
population, from Greece to Gaul;
it was Egypt that had a sufﬁcient
supply. Also the imperialist
aggressor imprint its culture on
the colony.

Persian Mithras an ancient cult
was widely accepted by the
Roman army. More lasting was
the influence of Christianity
which emerged from Judea. By
the Edict of Milan in 313,
Christianity became the ofﬁcial
religion of the Roman Empire.
Thus, Tickner demonstrated that
imperialism as a means of cultural
exchange has been a great
determinant of the course of
history.

Modern imperialism does not
beneﬁt either the entire economy
of the aggressor, so says Tickner,
nor the helpless colony, but

PAGE 3

imperialism is now a tool of a few
special interest groups in the
economy.

In the United States, as one
graduate student interpretes it,
the military, because of its very
nature and existence must remain
in the business of war. War
industries profit from our
imperialist adventure in Vietnam.

Anaconda Copper affects our
foreign policy towards Chile. Our
government acts in conjunction
with private oil concerns when
dealing in the Mid-East. As long as
a few Americans hold large
foreign interests, our government
will even go to war to protect
them.

Tickner cited political ends as
an excuse for ﬁghting in Vietnam.
A grad student insisted, though,
that half-a-miilion men are --there
to keep the military- industrial
complex thriving. '

Dean Tickner ruefully stated
that he is quite certain that the
major powers will continue to
dominate and exploit the smaller
nations indiscrimininantly, but he
hopes that they will ﬁnd a more
productive, imaginative, and
intelligent form of imperialism, if
this institution must exist.

Conference

trancended by the thought of

making it easy for freshmen
students.
The a bolition of required

subjects was also discussed.
Kuusisto favors the retention of
requirements but would be willing
to hear debate on the issue. It was
pointed out that the purpose of
abolishing requirements is not to
increase specialization, but to
prevent students from wasting
time and credits on courses of no
interest and therefore of little
value to them.
