STB Wins LeaguelgLeague II,III Playoffs Begin

by Mark Grand

STB’s long awaited League 1
championship was not a fluke.
Indeed, they were the ﬁnest
offensive team in the league, the
most well-drilled, in short, the
best. For a while, they had
trouble scoring points and as a
result tied two games which they
should have won.

They broke open in their last
regular season game, however,
scoring a resounding 44-0 win
over TXO. This proved to be the
start ofa streak which ran straight

through the playoff. They handily
defeated co-leader APA 15—0 in
their ﬁrst post-season game and
then downed EEP and KB 18-0
and 130 respectively.

ALC took the top spot with a
record of 9-2 amounting to a total
of 18 pts. APA also ammassed 18
pts. but a loss to ALC during the
season put them in second place.
PTC (7-2-2) with lo pts. and GDX
(7-3-1) with 15 ﬁnished third and
fourth respectively.

The League ll playoffs begin
todav with ﬁrst place ALC

meeting fourth place GDX.
Tomorrow, 2nd place APA takes
on 3rd place PTC. The winners of
each game tackle each other on
Saturday in the ﬁnal game of the
season.

Harriers Whip
Meet LeMoyne

by Robert Familant

The varsity Cross Country team
hosted Adelphi Saturday, looking
to continue their dominance over
the downstaters. The series record
against the long Islanders had
previously been 2-0.

The Great Danes continued
their winning ways with a strong
win, the score being 19-41. State
dominated the ﬁeld ﬁnishing ﬁrst,
second and third, and placing
seven runners in the top ten.
Dennis Hackett led the ﬁeld in the
fine time of 27:26,Tom Mills was

SUC New Paltz Downs

Danes 4 - 3 in Overtime

by Dave Fink

The Danes traveled to New
Paltz Saturday looking to rrin
their one game winning streak (?)
to two against an extremely
talented squad, but again Coach
Bill Schieffelin‘s varsity bootcrs
found a way to lose the game, this
time by a 4-3 count.

State started quickly, almost
scoring on the opening kick-off
only to be denied when a shot
narrowly missed the New Paltz
goal. They were not to be
discouraged however as
sophomore Gavin Lowdcr found
an opening and slanrrrrcd the ball
into the net fora 1-() Albany lead,

Captain Jim Shear made the
score 2-0 midway through the
second stanza as he converted a
penalty kick after New Paltz was
called for a hand ball inside the
goal area. The home team
narrowed the margin to 2-1 at the
lialf but the Danes raised their
lead to 3-1 at the end of the third
quarter on a goal by attacknran
Demetrius Michael.

Up until this tirrrc, State had
been able to keep New I’altz's
explosive forward line in check.

Described as “one of the ﬁnest
litres around" by Coach
Schieffeiirr, they are led by two
All-Americans, Bob Hippy and
Guy Casscrini, a junior college
All-American transfer from
Orange Community College. The
Danes could irot, apparently, hold
them out forever as they gave up
2 goals within the last seven
nrirrutes of regulation play to tie
the encounter at 3-3 and their a
third rrrarker in overtime to entire
out on the short end by a 4-3
SCOTC.

According to (‘oach Sclricffclin,
this was State's finest game all
year long. They outplayed New
Pilll'l. for most of the garric, in
fact, for all but those seven last
disastrous minutes. Ile sees the
latter as being a finer team than
even RI’I.

Albany plays their last game
Saturday against a well-drilled
l’lattsburgh contingent. The
upstaters last year went to the
NAIA post season tournament
and finished fourth.

They are not reputed to be as
strong this year but will be a
formidable opponent nevertheless.

ALBANY STUDENT ram

Today

second, Paul Holmes was third,
Bill Meehan was sixth, fourth for
State, and John Comerford
ﬁnished seventh, ﬁfth for State.
Comerford is a freshman and this
was the first time he raced against
varsity competition. There seems
to be a bright future in store for
him. Paul Holmes was awarded
“Runner of the Meet" honors. it
was the second time this year for
Paul. He also received this honor
at the Lemoyne Invitational. The
teanr record now stands at 8-4,
with only a dual meet with
LeMoyne remaining. That meet
takes place today.

The team has done remarkably
well this season despite a very
rough schedule. Coach Bob
Munsey, who deserves a lot of
credit for this ﬁne team, calls
them the hardest working team ire
lras coached iir eight years.

Taking a quick look iirto the
future, next year's team should be
as strong if not stronger than this
year‘s. Of the ﬁrst ﬁve State
ﬁnishers against Adclphi only one
will be graduating this June, Torn
Mills, and Pat chfei‘l one of
State‘s better runners, did not
ﬁnish as well as Ire normally does
bccriusc ofa bad cold. With such a
strong nucleus for next year‘s
squad, we should again have a
winning season.

players, four of them lettermen,
are back from last year’s 18-6
team, which finished third in the
NCAA College Division East
Regionnls. Only two of the
returnees were starters, however,
so the key to 1969-70 will be held
by the newcomers.

The only first stringers from
last winter's “Cardian Kids” are
senior captain Jack Adams, a ﬁ :9"
Voorheesville High grad, and 6‘0"
junior Jack Jordan from LaSallc
Institute, 'I‘roy. Among the losses
from last. year are All~American
Rich Margison, rugged center
Scott. Price, and floor general Jim
Cnverly. All were starters rind will
be hard to replace. Margison and
Price led the Great. Danes to a
51-17 mark the past three years.

Sriucrs will look to speed,
balance, and depth to maintain
Albany‘s reputation its an upstate
College Division power. As usual,
the Danes are lacking silo. Adams
has been ii buckcourt starter since
l067, averaging 10 and 9 points
per game in previous varsity
campaigns. lie is quick, a good
Iriill handler and tough on defense.

Jordan, who averaged “.21. 7 us a
freshman, led last year's team in
rebounds (210) and was second to

Margison in scoring (12.5).

Also returning are senior
lettermen Jim Sandy (6’1", John
Marshall High, Rochester) and Ed
Arsencnu (5'10", St. John's
Academny, Syracuse), and junior
Les Newmark (6'0", Stuyvesant.
High, New York). Sandy and
Arseneau were valuable subs last
season and figure to see plenty of
action.

Three transfer students upon
whom much depends are juniors
Steve Shechnn from Hudson
Valley, Alan Reid from Broome
Tech, and Jim Masterson from
ithnca College. Sheehnn, a 6'2",
200 pounder from Fort Edward,
is a solid rebounder, who may
take up the slack left by Price's
graduation. He pulled down 233
for HVCC last year. Steve also is ri
good shooter, as indicated by his
percentages of 63.9 from the field
rind 72.2 from the line. He
averaged 11.8 for the Vikings and
is the pre-scuson favorite for
starting center.

Reid, ii native of Binghumton,
was tri-cupinin of last. year's
powerful club at Broome, which
posted a 25-6 mark. The 6'2”
Chenango Valley graduate was

team MVP, was named to the
Empire State Conference second
team, and to the Region 3
All-Tournament. Team. He led his
squad in assists (135) and steals
(102) played the most minutes
(1077), was second in rebounds
(231), and averaged 10.1 points
per grime. Reid probably will gain
a starting forward position.

Musterson, whose brother Dick,
a transfer from Bemidji (Minn.)
State College, also is out for the
team, sat out. last. season after
transferring from Ithaca. As a
frosh for the Bombers, the former
Shaker High atar averaged 8.6 ppg.
He is leading candidate for a guard
slot.

Up from last. year's Albany
freshman club are 6’1” John
Helier of Elmira (Notre Dame),
6'3" Mike Hill of Troy
(Lansingburgh), and 6'2" Rich
Burns of Brooklyn (East). Heher
led the Dane pups with a 13.6
scoring average, while I-Iill
averaged 10.1 as starting center.
Both have promising futures and
should see considerable varsity
action. Burns played in only nine
games last. year.
