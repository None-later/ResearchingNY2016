The INTERAC T challe ' e:

by Cll’ol Hughes

INTERACT, "This is not
another coffee hour."
INTERACT. What INTERACT
will be is unknown; it hopes to aid
the search for a productive
learning process, wider in scope.
INTERACT. How can learning be
improved at Albany? INTERACT.
Come on Monday and “be
prepared to ‘sit on the floor.“
INTERACT.

Intriguing ideas are shaking this
academic community. Problems in
our present system are detaching
themselves from the background

and making themselves
undeniable. Where does education
go from here?

On Monday, November 10th, in
the Campus Center Assembly Hall
at 3 p.m., a new device for facing
and solving our problems will be
attempted. Students are urged to
suggest a more relevant form of
university education. The
University community is invited
to INTERACT.

According to Dr. Sidney
Reisberg, member of the Center
for Educational Communication
and a prime motivator in the

Student Association..

What? Why? How?

by Judy Baldasarri

University life has as its goal
the development of the whole
person. Student Association, as
the formal student government at
this university assumes not only
the responsibility of governing the
student community but also in
sharing the development of the
university student. Through its
very structure it fosters social,
recreational, academic, cultural
and spiritual opportunities
beyond those offered in the
classroom.

By virtue of the mandatory
student activity assessment all
students belong to the Student
Association, which derives its
basis and power from the student
body at large. Central Council as
the main executive and legislative
body not only enacts bills and
policies but also is responsible for
their implementation.

The present constitution,
effective only since 1966, calls for
this body to be representative,
those representatives coming from
groups and organizations which
touch every part of a student’s
life.

One source of representation is
based on a ratio of 1:400 for
each of the residence areas: three
representatives each from State.
Colonial and Dutch Quads; two
from Alumni Quad and ﬁve from
among the commuter population.

On the same structual level as
Centul Council is the Supreme
Court and the University Student

 

The student opinion poll on the
trustees' mics and regulations
conceming campus disorders
will be held November 17 and
18 from 10—4 in the NW alcove
of the main lobby of the

Judicial System. Whereas
Supremc Court deals with only
the legality and constitutionality
of certain bills and laws,
University Student Judicial
System directs its attention to
student infractions and violations
of university policy.

MYSKANIA, as the highest
non-academic honor given by the
University to thirteen ofitsjunior
students, is dedicated to the
purpose of preserving the aims
and ideals of the university as well
as of Student Association.

From this very simpliﬁed
structural breakdown, it can be
seen that Student Association’s
purpose is to represent the whole
campus community and reach
some portion of each individual’s
university life.

Come together this Mon a

program, INTERA is one more
step in meeting the challenge of
modernizing the academic
process. This program, if
successful, will provide new ideal
and new groups of interested

individuals to put them into ,‘

action at this University.
Monday’s event is the result of
several other efforts to improve
education in the State University
system. In May, the
Faculty Senate sent a resolution
to each school in the system
indicating the need for an
evaluation of the teacher-learner
relationship in undergraduate

education.
It instructed each school to
consider improvements, with

attention to increased unrest, new
methods of instruction, and the
creation of n more meaningful
system.

A workshop was held on this
campus in June, with one strident
and one faculty member
representing each school.

Dr. Rcisbcrg and Dave Neufeld
attended from Albany and shared
the consensus view that whatever
action was to be taken, it was

to aid striking GE

by Howard Arenz

Demonstrations against General
Electric Friday and a student
strike to precede the March on
Washington were the topics
discussed at Wednesday night’s
Student Mobilization meeting.

Chesin: university will

continue to

by Eric Retzlaff

Associate Dean of Students
Sorrell Chesin said in a recent
interview that the university
would continue to use police to
deal with drug use on campus.
The interview was an attempt to
clarify the university’s position on
this issue.

“One of the reasons most
colleges and universities have
taken on a more legalistic
relationship with students,”
(‘hesin explained, “is because
students have asked for this type
of relationship.”

“Ten years age this (the
oncampus drug arrest of four
students of Oct. 15) would never
have been handled by the police,"
he averted.

The arrest, allegedly in
connection with the use of
marijuana, was the ﬁrst ever on
the university campus. Chesin
indicated at the time of the arrest
that such “ﬂagrant abuse of the
law" could not be ignored.

He rapped Stony Brook's
policy of acting independently of
law enforcement agencies. He

use police

suggested that Albany State’s
relationship with the police had
prevented the infiltration of the
campus by narcotics agents.

How strenuously would the
administration hunt out drug
users? “We’re not out actively
searching the campus for
criminals," (‘hesin replied.

The question of the student's
legal right to privacy in a
dormitory is one which arises
naturally where university
administrators attempt to enforce
the drug laws. But it is a question
that is still very much in the air,
according to the legal department
of the State University system.
Although clear judicial precedents
may exist in some other states, no
such pronouncements have been
made in New York.

Asked whether the university
would search dorm rooms for
drugs if their presence is
suspected, Chesin stated, “As a
general rule we don‘t search
rooms. If a search is going to take
place, we will try to bring the
police in and have search
warrants."

 

The call for demonstrations
against General Electric is
precipitated by the scheduled
appearance of GE. here Friday to
recruit prospective employees. A
demonstration is necessary
because General Electric is
presently in the midst of a
deadlocked strike. The
corporation is adhering to a policy
of “Boulwarism” whereby
proposals for wage increases are
put before the striking unions on
a take it or leave it basis.

The Mobilization Committee’s
gripes against General Electric
stem not only from their
immediate stance regarding the
striking workers but additionally
because 20% of G.E‘s sales are
from defense contracts. However
the emphasis in Friday’s
demonstrations will be to support
the striking workers.

Specific plans for the
demonstration include workers
from G.E.‘s Hudson Falls plant
visiting the university campus in
order to wage what has been
called “Anti-interivcws.” While

.. .potakowaki

lans demonstration

workers

representatives from the
management side of the company
will be inside the administration
building emphasizing desirable
aspects of the company, S.M.C.
members and striking workers will
be outside the building
emphasizing the undesirable
aspects of the company

Currently S.M.C. is also
organizing a general student strike
to be held the 13th and 14th of
November, two days before the
Washington demonstration. The
rationale for the proposed strike is
to bring to the university campus
the sentiment and awareness that
will be expressed that Saturday in
Washington.

Plans by the committee call for
leaﬂets informing the student
body of the proposed strike to be
distributed two days before the
strike actually takes place. Also,

M.C. representatives will
approach Department Chairmen
informing them of the proposed
strike and presumably seeking
their support in urging additional
faculty members to call off
classes.
