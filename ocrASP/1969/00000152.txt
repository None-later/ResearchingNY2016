0N FILM

 

by michael nolin and diam dellcy

 

STERlLE CUCKOO is rated
“M” (suggested for mature
audiences); it should be rated “I”
(suggested for immature
audiences). Although the subject
of the ﬁlm deserves serious
treatment, the film is lobviously

aimed at the ﬁfteen-year-old
mind.

The plot traces the
development of a somewhat

unrealistic romance between two
college freshmen. Meeting on a
bus on their way to neighboring
schools, the two portray an
unusual and seemingly
incompatible couple right from
the start. Liza Minelli, as Pookie,
is an overly aggressive, friendless
“ugly duckling" who sets her
sights on the dullwitted,

baby-faced Jerry (Wendell

Burton) who gradually becomes
ensnared because of his inability
to be anything but the
too-gentleman.

It is hard to believe that Jerry
could not ﬁnd it in his heart or his
vocabulary to utter a single
put-down, let alone an insult that
others in his place would certainly
have had fun with. Pookie is so
obviously obnoxious at times that
Jerry’s submissiveness seems to
derogate his character to the point
of his being a more naive and
certainly less interesting Benjamin
Braddock (Dustin Hoffman in
“The Graduate").

The interest in the story is
adequately sustained throughout
the beginning of the ﬁlm. Though
Liza Minelli’s performance is not
what one could call Icharming, her
antics are very amusing so long as
she keeps her mouth shut. Her
facial expressions, eSpecially those
as she sits on the ﬁre escape
during a rainstorm and peers at
Jerry through the window, add

greatly to the comic effect.

The overall effect of the ﬁlm is
somewhat mined by the climatic
scene when the two kids ﬁnally
“do it," coming too early in
relation to the entire length of the
ﬁlm. The story as it unfolds from
that point on seems unnecessarily
drawn out, though a denouement
is inevitably essential to portray
the evolvement of feelings
traditionally associated with a
“ﬁrst love."

Director Pakula’s unwillingness
to coordinate the changing of
seasons islinexcusable. Pookie and
Jerry, wearing heavy jackets, play
in fallen leaves between
Thanksgiving and Christmas
vacations. Yet when they return
for second semester, they sit in a
fully leaved tree in shirtsleeves.
Furthermore, Mr. Pakula seems to
have no concept of editing.

Though Jerry and Pookie's
telephone conversation about the
future of their relationship is
realistic, it is even more tedious to
listen to the cyclical pleadings
from the audience than in person.
Pakula's direction makes it even
more boring to watch, Since the
camera does not move for the
duration of the conversation. This
boredom could have easily been
escaped by cutting to a reaction
shot of Jerry or at least having a
close-up shot of Pookie.

While STERlLE CUCKOO has
the makings for a good film with
an interesting storyline and the
debut of an admitably promising
young actress, it still lacks the

appeal to a mature audience
because it is slow-moving,
somewhat unrealistic, and

technically lacking the perfection
that can help sustain a ﬁlm’s
interest from beginning to end.

It’s this being big where it counts that,
makes Genesee a little more exciting
than any other beer.

Surroundings set the mood
for music faculty recital

by Warren Burt

The Art Gallery is a very
pleasant lace to have a concert.
The goo acoustics, the art, and
the whole environment speak of
elegance and good
taste. Tuesday high, the faculty
of the music department gave a
recital there and my previous
impressions of the art gallery were
further strengthened. A grou of
not too often heard pieces or a
fairly unusual group—the
woodwind quartet—were
performed, along with some other
pieces for Woodwinds. The lush
sound of the wind instruments,
the extremely pleasant music
played, and the very ﬁne playing
of faculty members Irvin Gilman,
William Hudson, Ruth McKee,
Daniel Nimetz and Findlay
Cockrell all combined to make an
extremely pleasant and enjoyable
evening.

As to the music itself, the
pieces chosen were four extremely
ﬁne examples of the genre of
wind writing by composers who
knew how to write for these
instruments. First on the program
was the Blaserquartett op. 8, no. 2
by Karl Stamitz, who was the son
of Johann Stamitz, key member
of the Mannheim School.

This light and airy piece which
dates from the middle of the 18th
century had as its chief attraction
for me the very lively and spirited
Rondo which formed its finale.
Especially notable about this
movement were the absolutely
treacherous horn parts, here
handled extremely well by Daniel
Nimetz.

The ‘ I‘hree Pieces" for Flute,
Clarinet, and Bassoon by Walter
Piston were also distinguished by

 

 



 

 

"STAND!" contains the best
and the worst of Sly and the
Family Stone. Some of the
songs—“Everyday People” and
“Sex Machine" are fantastic.
Others, such as “Somebody‘s
Watching You" are as blank as
Orphan Annie’s eyes. The music is
nice but the song just doesn‘t
come across.

0n the whole, the lyrics lack
poetry, but they compensate with
their down-to-earth brashness.
The musicianship might not be
virtuoso, but it also has that
earthy quality which makes it
another kind ofarl.

“STAND!” and “EVERYDAY
PEOPLE" represent a
complementary contrast, ifsuch a
thing exists. Beyond the surface,
they are both concerned with the

racial issue—but each in a
different way.
The earlier release,

“EVERYDAY PEOPLE,”
campaigns for the We-Are-All-One
approach. (“We've got to live
together— I’m no better and
neither are you.")

In “STAND!” we see a shift to
a sort of passive Black Power. The
Blacks want to stand up and be

recognized as men. (“They Will
try to make you crawl—“You
have YOU to complete and there
is no deal”) Maybe a combination
of these two ideas is what we
really need.

The racial problem is
crystallized in “Don’t Call Me
Nigger. Whitey.“ The
Maddox-and-Wallace-Iike Whites
who look on Blacks as simply
“niggers” can be conversely
scorned. (“Don't call me nigger
whitey. Don't call me whitey,

nigger.") ...Smile on your
brother...
The only instrumental and

most unique selection on the
album is “Sex Machine." It is
Sly‘s talking guitar making
mechanical love. Backed by the
steady beat, the music coasts
through its different moods and
ﬁnally returns to the main theme.
It is climaxcd by the primitive

pounding of the drums, faster and
faster, then slower and slower
until it dies in the silence. Sly is
right in the end when he says,
“We blew your mind."

A lesser, but still good, song is
“Let Me Take You Higher." There
may be nothing to the lyrics, but
it has such drive that in the end
you realize that it really has taken
you higher.

“Sing a Simple Song” isn’t as
simple a song as the words say.
Each member of the family gets
to perform in his own dynamic
way. The main idea of the song is
to keep happy because “You’re in
trouble when you ﬁnd it’s hard to
smile."

One of my favorite lines from
“STAND! " is worth
remembt ing: “Don't you know
that you are free, well at least in
your mind if you want to be."

the same careful attention to
idiomatic wind writing and
combinations of wind writing.
There is only one difference.
Here, the idiom is that of 20th
century neo-classicism, rather

,than 18th century classicism.

In this effective pairing of
ieces then, was made very
eautifully the comparison
between the music of the 18th
century and that particular style
which used it as its model. And
with the almost distilled
neoclassic manner of this piece
the nature of the nee-classic
movement became immediately
clear—it was a movement‘ in which
the composers wished to write
modern pieces, but not relinquish
completely the tonalities and
forms of the past. As a result,
pieces like the Piston—charming,
breezy, dissonant pieces that
almost anyone, regardless of
musical background can listen to
and say—“That sounds modern,”
and yet, not be offended by it.

The second half of the program
consisted of the Vivaldi Sonata in

‘G minor for Flute, Bassoon, and
Harpsichord, and the Rossini
Quartet no. 4 in B-flat major. The
Vivaldi was a typically Baroque
confection of great wit and levity.
The attractive thing here was the
harpsichord playing of Findlay
Cockrell, which, unfortunately for
some of those present, was close
to inaudible, due to the nature of
the instrument in a large room
like the gallery.

The Rossini quartet was a very
obvious piece of corn. However,
the saving grace was that it was so
completely obvious that it
possessed, in its own way, a
certain type of charm.

Especially delightful were the
“weeping” bassoon solo and the
“bumptious” clarinet solo,
excellently executed by Ruth
McKee and William Hudson. This
piece, as well as the other pieces
on the program, was music that
was enjoyable not only for the
listener, but for the performer as
well, and the ﬁne performances
these pieces receivedlrevealed the
joy with which they were played.
