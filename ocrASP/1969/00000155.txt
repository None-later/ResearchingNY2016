 [supporting
Nov. moratorium

_ 785-5444

. ism-Sti-

A statemnt mpporting the
Moratorium was passed by Central
Council Thursday night. The Bill,
introduced by Dave Neufeld and
Mike Avon, passed by a 26-10
vote. The context of the bill is
bddyr' that Council endorses the
moratorium on November 13 and
14 and encourages the students to
dissent and express their feelings
onthe war.

The bill urges all faculty to
either cancel classes or not
penalize students who are absent
during the moratorium and
especially not to schedule tests
these dates.The bill also endorsed
the March on Vladiington on
November 15th. C 'softhebill
were sent to the esident and
Vice President of the United
States. Secretaries of State and
Defense, Senators Goodeli and
Javits, and Chancellor Gould.

In observation of the
moratorium Central Council will
not meet November 13th. Council
also voted in favor of a motion I'JIy
Lenny Kop to postpone t e
Opinion Poll, on the Rules and
Regulations for the Maintenance
of Public Order on cam us. The
poll, originally schedu ed this
week will be held November 17
and 18, instead.

Some disenssion was held again
this week on the purpose of the
ASP-The university community
and its responsibility to the
Student Association. Joe Kaiser
said that the primary rpose of

the ASP was that of istributing
information relative to theStudent
Association. Some members of
Council didn’t feel that the ASP
fulfilling

was this function

adequately. Gary Gold su'ested
that Communications Commission
should look into this situation.

In regard to the ASP, Lenny
Kopr ~"'tzested the possibility
that cw members of the AS
staff be given credit for their work
on the newspa r. This would be
done in order at the staff could
afford to spend more time
working on the ASP. As it is now
some members of the ASP staff

t in so much time, that they
eel that it is seriously affecting

their studies. It was brought up
that the possibility of giving credit
for involvement in student
activities was being looked into on
abroades .

Central Council decided that it
is time for a self-evaluation of
student Association. Gary Gold
suggested that there has been a
breakdown in communication
b e t w e e n m a n y
Association I'txgariizatiom.

A proposal by Gold to hold a
special Evaluation session of
Central Council was passed
unanimously. The session will be
6:30 p.m., Sunday, December 7.
Besides Central Council, the
Chairman of Commissions,
Supreme Court, Representatives
ofMyskania, SA Committee
Chairmen, and others at the
discretion of the President of
Council will be invited to attend.

Announced at Council was the
resignation of Skip Counts, a
commuter representative, on
Central Council and the
resignation of Bob D‘Elena as
chairman of Communications
Commission. D’Bem will be
replaced by Donna Simonetti.

dissatisfaction or concern. Then
two quartets. each with the same
common concern got together. In
this group of eight came the
ultimate interaction. The common
concern was worked over.

at all the varied discussion
eventually boiled down to was the
conclusion that there was a need
for increased communication and
interaction.

An idea for a three day
cessation of classes during which
the entire University community
could interact was proposed. The

to get people to talk to one
another was also suggested. The
general concensus was that more
interacts encompassing a greater
number of people were necessary.

This innovative, novel approach
to breaking down the barriers
between faculty and faculty,
student and student, and student
and faculty ended depressineg
conventionally.

What interact failed to provide
was a mode for implementation of
the ideas and plans discussed.
Talking alone is not sufﬁcient. A

called for next Monday at 3:00

new stu ent left movemen

' by MM
Josh Muravchik, National
Chariman of Young Peoples
Socialist League, spoke on
“Toward a New Student Left"
last Thursday evening. He stated

that S.D.S. is dead and a new-

student movement of the 70‘s
should be formed. This new
movement must not destroy itself
the way the old left and the new
left have.

Mr. Muravchik, who described
himself as a professional radical,
said S.D.S. died on October 8
when the Weatherman engaged in
violent activities in Chicago. The
new student left was born on
October 15 when all over the
nation over a million student
peacefully demonstrated against
the war.

Young Peoples Socialist League
(YPSL) supports the moratorium
in November but is against the
mobilization of thousands of
Beople to march on Washington,

.C. on the 15th. They feel that if
it is violent, it will play right into
Nixon's hands and give him a

11‘

judge will also set the bail at this
time.

If there is any trouble, attempt
to remember all the specifics (ex.
faces of participants, names of
witnesses, badge numbers of
police, etc.)

Before you act irrationally,
please consult the lawyers that
will be at the demonstration. Ask
your monitor to point them out.

ainst violence, 

‘chsnce to repress future anti-war
demonstrations.

l Muravchik gave three reasons 11,

for the fall of the S.D.S. First
their identiﬁcation with foreign
countries such as Red ‘
Cuba, and North Vietnam. What
worked in these countries can't
work here, especially guerrilla
warfare.

Second, the belief of the S.D.S.
that those closest to you are your
enemies. This was first applied to
the Liberals and now to other
factions, such as R.Y.M. and the
Weathermen.

Third is their insistence upon
their demands being met
promptly. If this is not done then
they feel justiﬁed in becoming
more violent.

_ YPSL is determined not to be
destroyed by any of the above.

They don’t align thenseives with
the politics of any other nation.
ey try to work with other
groups. .

Muravchik said, "We must have
the support of the majority to get
anything done. We must form a
coalition with other groups such
as the American labor movement
and various ethnic and racial
groups.”

YPSL is against violence and
believes in the democratic system.
it supported Humphrey in ’68
because they felt he was better
than Nizon. Mr. Muravchik points
out that with Humphrey we
wouldn’t have had Burger, the
A B M, the Haynsworth
nomination, and welfare cuts.

Kuusisto:
moratorium

At his regular Monday press
conference, President Kuusisto
reiterated the University’s policy
of last month concerning the
Vietnam moratorium.Professors
were asked not to give tests on
Thursday and Friday and hope
was expressed that no teacher
would penalize students for
missed classes due to participation
in the moratorium.

Many aspects of the urgent
housing problem came into
question. Kuusisto expressed
increasing disillusionment with
construction on Indian Quad. and
seriously doubited its completion
by Fall 1970. No definite plans
are forthcoming regarding off-
campus housing contracted by the
University.

Also discussed was the library.
Kuusisto feels that the present
library collection is inadequate for
a University of this size. However,
an increase in funds for the
library has been requested in the
1970-71 budget.
