It seemed as if it would never
come to pass but alasl, the 1969
varsity soccer season has ended.

The Danes hosted SUC
Plattsburg Saturday, trying to
salvage something form a
disappointing season.

Championship.
by Jay Marshall

The League II football season
reached its ﬁnal stage Monday as
defending champs ALC met PTC.
The teams played to a 0-0 tie and
will meet again this afternoon to
determine the league
championship.

In the semiﬁnals, ALC defeated
fourth place GDX 8-0, while FTC
defeated third place APA 60 on
Saturday. These two teams had
tied on Friday as APA scored on
the last play of regulation time,
causing the teams to meet again
on Saturday. I’TC’s lone score was
by Marty Amerikancr on a 98
yenrd interception return.
In yesterday's game,

USAGUE ll SEASON Continues with ADC playing NC for the

teams missed excellent
opportunities to score. ALC drove
to the PTC three yard line in the
first half only to lose the ball on
downs. Another drive late in the
first half was stopped by one of
the six interceptions by the PTC
defense. PI'C took the offensive
initiative in the second half. They
reached the ALC ﬁve but ALC
held and a field goal attempt was
missed. After an interception later
in the half, I’TC drove to the ten
yard line, but ALC’s defense
stiffened and stopped the drive.

If the PTC defense can prevent
ALC, the leading offensive team.
from socring, there is no telling
when the new league champions
will be crowned

‘the first half on goals by
attackman Demetrios Michael and
sophomore John Proulx but late
in the second stanza, Coach
Schreffelin‘s booters began to
falter and quickly gave up two
goals to a Plattsburg squad that
was no better than their
opponents. Indeed, the upstater’s
potential All-American forward
Bill Garvey didn't even play, being
sidelined with a Broken ankle.

From this point on, the gain
-‘an away from the Danes. It
seemed that all the season’s
hardships caught up to them as
Plattsburg scored three more goals
in this second half. Michael's
se on oal o t e ame was the
may Allmny S’Tlliihtgspot in this
stanza.

Looking ahead to next year.
Coach Schicffelin sees a need for
strength at the halfback spot.
Back next year will be such
Stalwarts as Michael up from,
fullbacks Jocl Volinski and Steve
Backus and goalies John Thaycr
and Terry Jordan.
