Albany High School

Continued from page 1
students began to clash. But Chief
of Police Edward McArdle stated
that “when there was no positive
response, we began easing them
out."
As a result of the process of
“easing out" the students, a 17
year old girl was treated at Albany
Medical Center for an injured
back, another student was treated
for a cut hand and scalp, another
for a cut scalp, and a fourth for an
abdominal injury.

In addition two policemen
received medical attention, one
with scalp cuts, the other with a
fractured wrist. Six
demonstrators, including two
University students, were arrested.

The incidents at the high school
caused many repercussions. The
police were accused of not
wearing badges. Police Chief
McArdle answered this charge by
stating that “the badges would
have been ripped off. The uniform
is sufﬁcient."

The actions of the police
carried the dispute over to
yesterday. Approximately ﬁfty
University students met at city
hall at 8:15 where they were to
meet a march of the black
community let by the Black
Panthers. Though the Panthers did
not make it, Mayor Erastus
Corning did.

At an impromptu sidewalk
news conference, Mayor Corning
placed the blame for the high
school disturbance squarely on

the shoulders of SUNYA students.
The situation, he said, was
“created and fostered by State
University students."

However, when Corning was
asked other questions, including
those concerning the police
action, he replied that he was
“trying to get all the facts
together.” As University students
cried “You’re full of shit!”
Corning entered City Hall.

The next occurrence took place
when approximately 250 black
and white students and
community people met at Panther
headquarters for a march to the
Public Safety Building.

Under the strict supervision of
the Black Panthers, the march was
a peaceful silent demonstration
for those arrested on Wednesday.
After marching silently from
9:15am till IOIISam the marchers
entered the courtroom for the
arraignment. All three defendants
pleaded not guilty to the various
charges against them.

At this point, various high
schools will remain closed today,
a school boycott has been urged
for the entire Albany system, and
The Brothers and Black Panthers
have asked for an outside
evaluation of the Albany Police
Force, possibly by the
University’s School of Criminal
Justice, an investigation of
individual crimes by policemen,
and an implementation of the
black student’s demands.

The story of the Albany High
School problem is not ended yet.
On Sunday, the entire Albany
black community has been asked
to attend a maeeting where the
situation will be discussed.

The current editors of the ASP
are opening applications for the
position of editor-in-chief to all
upper division students at the
university (only juniors, seniors
and graduate students may apply).
A plications should be submitted,
c o the ASP editors, to the

They should include the nature of
previous experience with any
publication, reasons for interest in
the position, ideas for
improvement of the ASP.
Applicants will be notified for
interviews. No applications will be
accepted after November 20.

would interfere with trafﬁc at the
cirlc.

It was then proposed to move
the huts into the fountain across
from the Lecture Rooms; once
again, the dean claimed their
placement at that spot would
interfere with pedestrian traffic.
The students then pointed out
that the vast majority of students
no not make it a habit to walk
across the empty concrete
fountain in the middle of
November.

Dean Chesin, noticing the late
hour, said “We've been all through
this before. Obviously, we cannot
reach complete agreement in this
matter." He departed, informing
the students that maintenance
men would he at the podium at 8
am. to “assist” the students with
the removal of the huts to the
Campus Center mail.

The students felt that the best
course open to them was to
accept the “agreement” and not
jeapordize the peaceful aspect of
the moratorium. Several
dissented.

At this point, one of the huts
had been set on fire. (Dean Chesin
claimed the huts were being
guarded by security police as he
spoke to the students. However,a
MOBE student checked with
security and claimed the campus
police had not been told to do so
at this point.)

At any rate, Dean Chesin
chased the two students sccn
selling the ﬁre, apprehended one,
and turned him over to security.
They withheld his name. All
appearances pointed to the
conclusion that gasoline had been
LlScti to ignite the hut with the
intcntion of preventing Student
MOBli from carrying on its
planned activities.

By 8:30 Thursday morning,
111aintc111111cc had moved the huts
to the mall. As the day wore on,
MOBE students realized their plan
was not gaining the widespread
support they expected. The poor
location attracted little attention.
They decided to 111ch the huts
back to the podium.

They were in the process of
doing this when 11 very excited
and upset Dean (‘ltcsin arrived,
literally screaming that the
“agreement” of the previous night
had been violated. He warned the
students were breaking
administrative policy and vowed
to call the maintenance men.
They never came.

In the afternoon, a closed
meeting took place in Dr.
Thorne‘s office attended by Dean
Thornc, Dean Chesin, Don
Carrier, and a few MODE
students. A number of people,

including Bill O’Kain, were
refused admittance. WSUA and
ASP reporters were denied
entrance and told a statement
would be issued later.

Dr. Thorne, in his statement,
said it had been agreed that the
village would stay up until 4:30
with the students guaranteeng it
would not be burned. He also
claimed the “agreement” reached
last night had been violated and
reiterated the potential fire hazard
to the podium.

Outside, a debate emerged with
some students claiming the village
should be dismantled
immediately. Others felt it should
stay up until 4:30, in which case a
list of students assuming

You can’t keep a good group down

responsibility for any damage that
might occur would have to be
given to the administration. Many
felt this was unwise; the huts were
then carried to the Campus Center
Mall.

Though this action solved the
immediate problem, the events
caused a deeper issue to emerge
and remain unsolved: To what
extent is the “normal flow of
traffic" a superior concern to
political and moral protest?

Also at question was the
apparent policy of the University
in reaching a decision, refusing to
compromise that decision in
negotiations, and claiming a
coerced agreement had been
violated.

An Anti-War Rally

by Carol Rosenberg

November lS--March on
Washington? What is this all
about--people going to the
capitol? A moratorium? A strike?
To clear up matters, let us inform
the public once and for all that
Saturday, Nov. 15, 1969 has been
deltlﬂared the day for an anti-war
ra y.

This mass gathering is being
sponsored by Student
Mobilization and New
Mobilization Committee. It is
being supported by the
Moratorium Committee, the
majority of which encompasses
the new Democrats, while the
former consists of more diverse
types of people--radicals, paciﬁsts
and independents.

The demonstration, called to be
peaceful and non-violent, proports
the immediate and total
withdrawal of all troops from Viet
Nam, and an end to the Thieu-Ky
regime. Scheduled for the day will
be a march past the White House
to the rally.

The permit for that march,
which does not include the rally,
has been recently granted by the
justice department.

Had the permit not been issued,
violence and disruption might
have developed. There Will always
be these possibilities, so to set the
tone and offer protection there
will be “marshalls” from those
among the marchers. Accordingly
there will be one marshal! for
approximately every 100 persons.

At this rally, Mr. Nixon will be
challenged to show his majority
support. The anti~war supporters

Young Democrats rte-organize

by Tobi Goldstein

During 1966, throughout the
country, College Young
Democrats were dying like ﬂies.
Risking their status in the
National Democratic Committee,
they dared publish a manifesto
denouncing the Johnson
administration’s policy concerning
Vietnam. They were promptly
expelled from the National
Democratic Committee.

Fortunately, you just can’t
keep a good group down. Fall
1969 saw the resurrection. Going
along with the national trend,
Albany State re-formed and chose
leaders. The College Young
Democrats 11! SUNY Albany
decided to rc-organize, which they

did, naming Ed Allegretti as
President.

The goals are idealistic, the
methods pragmatic. The College
Young Democrats believe in
working through the
Establishment to change existing
life situations. They are
committed to ending the war in
Vietnam, but are devoting as
much time to other issues. Action
is being planned on getting liberal
officials elected and putting an
end to water and air pollution.

President Allcgrctti envisions
the group as a multi-partisan
coalition, similar to the one that
recently rc-elccted John Lindsay.
He hopes that they will work with
other groups on campus that have
the same goals.

Allegretti, however, admits that

feel that his speech last week on
the war has made their position
stronger, and considerably
increased their number strength at
the march.

SUNYA will be sending about
550 persons from uptown, seven
buses from downtown, plus an
uncountable number of people
who will be going by car and
hitchhiking.

The buses will be leaving from
here Friday night Nov. 14 at
10:00 pm. All those going are
urged to be at the circle at 9:45
bringing with them their I.D.,
waiver, ticket, warm jackets, food,
a small ﬁrst aid kit, and extra
money.

They are expected to depart
from Washington about 12
midnight Saturday and arrive back
in Albany 9:00 Sunday morning.

Kuusisto on

Albany High

In order to clarify the role of
the students and faculty from
SUNYA in the recent incident at
Albany High School, President
Allan A. Kuusisto stated the
following:

“It appears that a Very small
number of students here were
involved in the episode, and an
even smaller number of faculty
have been among those involved
in seeking solutions to the
situation. The university has not
authorized such activity and
wishes it made clear that all
involved are acting as individuals
and in no way reﬂect ofﬁcial
University policy.

“That, as citizens, they are
concerned about the community
is understandable. However, the
University hopes that action of
responsible scholars, and those
they instruct, will help prevent
further incidents and the concern
they feel will be transmitted in
patterns appropriate to the goals
they expect accomplished."

The current editors of the ASP are opening applications for the
position of editor-in-chief to all upper division students at the
university (only juniors, seniors and graduate students may apply).
Applications should be submitted, c/o the ASP editors, to the Campus
Center Information Desk. They should include the nature of previous
experience with any publication, reasons for interest in the position,
ideas for improvement of the ASP. Applicants will be notified for
interviews. No applications will be accepted after November 26.
