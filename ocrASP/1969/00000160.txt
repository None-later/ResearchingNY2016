Brothers & Sisters

to receive the profits

by Kathy Reilly

Smile on your brother! Tire
theme of this year's all-University
Telethon, which will run frorn 7
pm. Friday to 7 pm. on
Saturday. also sums up the
attitude of the Big Brothrr“ of
Albany, who will receii-e the
proﬁts from the Telethon.

This Albany group is allied with
a national organization which ltas
aided over l00,000 boys in the
past 65 years. Presently about 400
big and little brothers are active in
the tri-cities progratrt.

A basic function of BB is to
provide friendship. guidance and
affection on an individual basis to
youngsters from deprived or
broken homes. A big brother‘s
purpose is to support (not
replace) a child‘s parents. and to
present an identifiable male image
to the boy. Through a warm
personal relationship. the agertcy
tries to aid the child‘s
development into a stable. happy
adult life.

By individually matching big
and little brothers on tile basis of
common interests. skills and

background. the movement
attempts to insure a successful

relationship. Shared social,
educational and recreational
activities foster a genuine

friendship between the brothers.
Many Albany students are active
in the program: they take their
brothers to baseball and football
games. bring them to dinner on
campus. and tutor them.

Expanding their organization
and professionaiizing their
standards are the short-term
projects of the Big Brothers. To
raise their standards. they hope to
hire additional full-time staff
metnbcrs. artd to improve their
systetn of matching big and little
brothers. Recruitment of reliable
big brothers. especially frotn the
Albany area. is a major goal for
the future.

The Telethon is one of a
number of recent fund-raising
events bencfitting the Big
Brothers. (Another was the
cottcerl by “The Who" last
Monday in Albany.) Money will
be used primarily to finance their
general expenses and to expand
their program.

Third telethon
begins tonight

by Laura Geffen

This all-nighter shouldn’t be for studying or
bull-shitting. You can spend all tonight “smiling on
your brother” at TELETHON ’69. The third annual
telethon will be held from 7 pm. tonight till 7 pm.
tomorrow in the Campus Center ballroom.

The funds raised during these 24 hours of
continuous entertainment Will be given to the
Albany County Chapter of Big Brothers—Big Sisters
of America. Children who are missing the Interest.
attention and love of a parent are being helped by
the presence of Big Brothers and Big Sisters who
volunteer to spend their time working and playing
with these children.

The first Telethon was in March, l967~the result
of seven months of planning and doubt. It was the
first program of this kind on any college campus.
and the proceeds were given to the Mental Health
Association. The success of the first telethon. aside
from the money raised, was the evident interest the
University was taking in the community. and the
handling of an undertaking of that size.

Last year. the Telethon culminated a week of
fund-raising activities known as Campus Chest.
Proceeds from this Telethon went to the Student
Mental Health Work-Study lntcrne Project and to
buy materials for tutoring in the poorer sections of
Albany. One of the highlights of last year’s Telethon
was a half-hour of local television coverage.

Again this year, Telethon ends a week of Campus
Chest activities, which included booster sales. a
trivia contest. and the election of Miss Campus
Chest. Other nearby schools have been invited to
participate, to make this an intercollegiate evertl.
The range of entertainment is wide. including many
musical performers and a special Children‘s Time.

Co-chairmen Norma Israel and Sandy Kleinmart
want to emphasize that TELETHON '69 is not
competing with the Moratorium and Washington
trip, but rather working toward the same goal. If
you‘re not going to Washington. you can do
something for peace by helping the young people in
Albany. And if you're going to Washington, spend
your first three hours at TELETHON '69.

and—“Smile on Your Brother.”

THE EVOLUTION OF CINEMA

by Tom Quigley

 

 

Many of the criticisms leveled
at Frank and Eleanor Perry’s
LAST SUMMER stem from a
misinterpretation of the esoteric
signiﬁcance of the film. Major
critics have judged it on a
superficial basis as a self-conscious
venture into freshman psychology
relying heavily upon pretentious
symbolism. This erroneous
supposition belies the neurotic
concept that the Perry's are
striving to illustrate.

This film has nothing to do
with whether or not the kids are
reasonable representations of the
“new” generation. It‘s quite
obvious that they’re tnock
versions of their parents: social
register snobs inhabiting a vacuum
of affluent unreality.

The Perry's are guilty of over
doing the symbolism but these
symbols are introduced purposely
in order to present the controlling
theme of feminine sexual
dominance. At the center of this
ﬁlm lies man's ancient struggle
with the id. instigated by the
enigma of the feminine mystique.

Sandy is more than an enticing.
frigid beauty. She is the bitch
goddess of the adolescent sexual
fantasy: an ageless concept of
arousing. untouchable beauty
with the ability to motivate and
control men. Sandy‘s virgin
vindictiveness is fascinating bait
for David and Peter who are at the
crucial stage of adolescence where
sex is the tantalizing untried
experience.

The boys are victims of the
unfathomable libido with no
satisfying outlet. David does
Sandy's bidding eagerly. hoping to
eventually score. Peter’s struggle
to be is a bit more accute because
of his underlying sensitivity. When
Sandy appears however he too
becomes enchanted with the idea
of sexual conquest and falls in
line. Sandy consciously
manipulates the boys with an
occasional strip as site swills her
beer with sensual gusto. She frilly
appreciates the cruelty of her
position.

Enter Rhoda, a pudgy tttisfit
whose abrasive logic threatens to
topple Sandy from her exaulted
position arid tltc battle for control
ensues. Peter‘s hidden self is
revealed in the tender moments
with Rhoda but the sexual
weakness in his youthful character
enables Sandy to utilize him for
her final triumph. The horrifying
Goldingesquc overtones in the
symbolic death of Rhoda leaves
one with a revulsion and
fascination for the extent that otlr
characters are influenced by otrr
animaiislic nature.

The Perry‘s have ttol
constructed a flimsy satire about a
grottp ol corrupt childrctt t‘cvcling

limited insight into the mysteries
of the sexual psyche. We cannot
completely understand the film
because as humans we cannot
cotnpletely understand all the
forces that motivate our actions
and shape our personalities.

Frank Perry's direction is beset
by minor technical flaws such as
the sound cquipment’s battle to
catch dialogue despite the wind
and the over-use of the hazy ﬁlter
lens to cast an aura of unreality
around the entire production. His
direction of the actors and use of
tile Fire island locations is
admirable.

Eleanor Perry‘s script relies too
heavily on four letter cxpletives
and sporadic nudity tints wearing
the shock value out after a few
damns. Many of her phallic
symbols are irteffectivc but the
wounded gull is essential in the
establishment of Sandy's
character.

After the gull heals. is rc-taught
to fly. and trained to return, it
rtntst exercise its natural struggle
for independence. Yet when it
irtcvitably bites Sandy, the bitch
goddess has been violated and her
control challenged. Thus she has
no alternative but to destroy the
gull as a sign of her all-inclusive

dominance.
Mrs. Perry socks her message
across but forsakes substantial
characterization in favor of
symbolic representation. Thus the
only real character in the film is
Rhoda. who suffers because of her
less than subserviant attitudes.
Cathy Burns manages to evoke the
sympathy that tnakes Rhoda the
pathetic victim of the insensitivity
about her. Barbara Hershey does
her mindblowing best as Sandy in
her body packing bikini and
Richard Thomas as Peter gives a
painful portrayal of an adolescent
in conflict. Bruce Davidson as
David orgasms convincingly.

LAST SUMMER dctnonstrates
the power of the sacred virgin in
this society. We venerate a vulgar
institution that excludes the
warmth of human irtvolvemcrtt
while exploiting inexperience and
confusion. Sandy wields her
sexualin like a weapon and
flaunts her virginity like an
ultimate prize. There is hope for
Peter at the end of the film if he
realizes that the only weapon
against this callousncss is
sincerity. This is why the film
transcends the rncdiocrily of
pretension. It dignifies the
struggle to grasp our most abused
reality...love.
