The League 11 football season
ofﬁcially ended late Tuesday
afternoon upon the close of the
ALC-PTC championship game.
Once again, the two teams played
to a scoreless tie, thus the league
has co-champions: PTC and ALC.

Neither team was able to
mount an offensive threat during
the game. The wet ﬁeld and
slippery conditions deﬁnitely
affected both squads. PTS’s best
plays were interception returns
and a blocked punt. 'l'he
formidable ALC offense, top in
the league, was held scoreless by
the FTC defense for the third time
this year.

 

Dec. 19th.

This was the most competitive
season in League 11 history. Third
place APA ﬁelded a strong squad
which lost only one game before
its playoff loss to I’TC. GDX,
which ﬁnished the season in
fourth place, had a very successful
campaign for a new fraternity.
The highlight of their year was a
6-0 victory over ALC during the
regular season. With the whole
squad returning, GDX will
deﬁnitely be one of the stronger
teams next season if they choose
to remain League II. Stumpy‘s

missed the play-offs by one point
and ﬁnished a respectctable ﬁfth.

Football Now!

by Rich Friedlander and Tom LaBarben
Co-chalrmen F.A.S.T. Committee

It is time that this so-called University had a football team.

For years this to ic has been kicked around by both students and
faculty. Polls have een taken and committees have been set up year
after year. Each time the polles show a response that is
overwhelmingly in favor of football, not just among the students but
the faculty also.

Yet, we so not have a football team. Why?

A lprogram for the institution of football as a varsity sport was
passe by Central Council. Yet, we do not have a football team. Why?

The Final Report of the University Athletics Council for 1968
reconﬁnended that a football program be initiated as quickly as
possr e.

Every year this same type of statement is made. Every year we
grow larger and larger. We are told football will start next year and
when we come in the fall, there isno football. Why?

There is a fund available for starting a football team. This fund
contains over $16,000. This is more than enough to start a football
team. Yet, we still do not have a football team. The beneﬁts to the
University from a football team have long been talked about and
acknowledged. But where is our football team?

We feel the time has come for an answer to these questions. Upon
Extensive examinations of the facts and talks with high administrative
ofﬁcials we have an answer to this question.

It seems that the University has certain priorities and feels that
football is on the bottom of the list. Thus new faculty members are
hired in other departments and not in Phys. Ed. It is the responsibility
of the student body to make it clear to the administration that
football is on the top of the priority list of the students.

In the past, the students have felt that their opinions in an opinion
poll would be heeded. This was not the case! The time for opinion
polls and idle promises is over. We demand that this administration
come down off their pedestal and reevaluate some of their priorities.
We demand a football team to be started in the Fall of 1970, with the
lUnbijerstiy hiring the necessary coaches immediately, with University

un s.

Upon careful consideration of this negligence on the part of the
universrty we see no other alternative. We as students stand ﬁrm in
tlus demand, and tlus time this goal will not be snuffed aside.

We have been pledged the support of the officers of the Class of
1970, the Class of 1971, and the Class of 1972 along with the support
of lnterfratcrmty Council lntersorority Council, and the Ofﬁcers of
Student Association in achieving this goal. What is needed now is
broad and vocal support by the entire student body. This should be
made known to Dr. Kuusisto and the rest of the administration. We

\tivantnh'im to know that before he steps down, we want our football

Knight os. Stringer I . V I; g‘ g, _
Prediction of ” more Vietnam ‘

by Robert Warrior

Yesterday afternoon in LC 7,
Professor Knight of the Political
Science Department, and a

, student,Ken Stringer, debated the

Vietnam War and related topics.
The Professor strongly defended
his liberal anti-War position
against the conservative Stringer.
By the end of the debate, Stringer
was on the defensive.

Professor Knight was ﬁrst to
speak. “Clear to my mind, the
President has the right to do what
he wants in Vietnam," he ruefully
commented. Although this is not
consititutional it has precedent in
American history. And he predicts
many more “Vietnams”; this
could only be the beginning.

Knight made it a point that one
must maintain consistent values
when talking about American
involvement in Vietnam or in
Israel, despite any loyalty one
may have for the latter.

Batman’s “Immoral Science”
Draws Faculty Reflections

by Glenn Newman

At the invitation of Zetetiks,
the philosophy club, Prof.
Bernard Bowron of the City
University of New York came to
campus on Nov. 12. Bowron is the
author of an article entitled, “The
lmmorality of Irrelevance: The
Responsibilities of Science."

Bowron presented his article
and then two members of the
University faculty, Prof. James
Corbett of the Physics department
and Dean O.W. Perlmutter of the
Political Science and Sociology
departments, comment on it.

“Doing disinterested science, or
science for its own sake is likely
to be immoral and that the
encouragment to do disinterested
science is immoral," cited
Bowron. He objected to the use of
public funds for the support of
programs which do not have any
particular goal.

The reason disinterested science
is immoral is because it “subtracts
limited manpower and funds from
necessary projects.” Bowron
continued saying that a man who

chooses a life devoted to science
for its own sake “turns his back
on the world and its problems."

In order to remedy this
situation Bowron suggested that
individual requests for public
funds be evaluated on the merits
of the foreseeable outcomes of
the project.

Bowron also made the point
that the scientist would then be
held responsible for all purposes
his findings were put to, because
he would have foreseen the
results.

Prof. Corbett generally agreed
with Bowron but felt that some of
the good science had provided
had been overlooked. Corbett also
believed that the theory on the
responsiblity of the scientist could
be expanded to include all people
whose ideas bad later been
misused.

He thought that some art for
art's sake, music for music's sake
and science for its own sake was
good.

Dcan Perlmutter stated that the
theory of individual grants
presented by Bowron would not
work because of the planning
necessary to achieve difﬁcult
goals. He felt that society
allocates money to reach a goal

such as getting a man on the
moon. If there is a lack of
specialists in one ﬁeld then the
society must do something to
make that ﬁeld more attractive, as
it has done in Chemistry and
Physics, by encouraging studies in
those ﬁelds.

Bowron maintained that there
are thousands of men being
mistrained and going into ﬁelds
that are useless and as he put it
“to be an expert in a subject in
which there is no use is to a
human frill in a class with
unfunny clowns and prostitutes
past their prime.”

Stringer, the conservative’s
student stalwart, made it perfectly
clear that he is not an apologist
for the Nixon Administration nor
any preceding administration. He
maintains that the participants in
the Moratorium are altruists, blind
of reality—the true murderers of
American soldiers and
Vietnamese.

He seemed rather bitter about
the Oct. 17 issue of the ASP
which carried a caption that held
the government responsible for
the deaths of our soldiers.

The ASP’s bias against the War
gave Stringer, so he thought,
justiﬁcation to address more than
one hundred of his peers in the
audience as “neo-Che
Guevara-ites”, communists,
socialists, revolutionaries, and any
other name that William Buckley
might use.

In reaction to the ASP, be
accused the liberal and radical
segments of American society of
killing our soldiers by prolonging
the War, not the government
which put them there.

Stringer is against our
involvement, however, because he
feels it is not in our interest to be
there. He thinks our entire foreign
policy “in a word, stinks." But be
qualified his statement by saying
that since we are there, we ought
to do our best.

A big themein his argument was
the use of the ballot box to
cahnge American policy. “It is
easier to change leaders than
policy." Therefore, our electoral
system can right all wrongs,
within all levels of government.

Knight, in reply,questioned
Erastus Corning‘s power to help
end the War if he were so inclined.

Knight said that we MUST
criticize the War if we feel it is
wrong. He cautioned Stringer on
his “like it or leave it" attitude

 

toward dissenters. This is only a
ploy, to rid America of dissent in
order that the pro-War sentiment _
could prevail and maintain its
policies.

A student from the audience
insisted that the purpose of the
War from the viewpoint of the
Government was not an altruistic
attempt to stop tyranny, but an
attempt to get an economic
foothold or sphere of inﬂuence in
Vietnam.
