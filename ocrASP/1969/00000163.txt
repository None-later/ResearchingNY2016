FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2], I969

 

This Friday will mark the
beginning of the second Di pikill
Debate Tournament in the oods.
The tournament, sponsored by

----»-Borensics Union, is‘idesigned to

offer forms of debate which are
not often offered on the

-- traditional debate circuits.

Forensics Union has discarded
the traditional format of using
one national topic for all debates
within a rigid structure of time
periods. A11 debates at Dippikill
will have different debate
resolutions and the debators will
have the option of discarding the
resolutions offered by SUNYA in
favor of their own. Impromptu
debating, a traditional time
format with a topic chosen ten
minutes before the debate round
begins, will be the predominent
form of debate.

Lincoln Douglas debating will
also be offered. This type of
debate features one man debating
directly against another (as

" opposed to the traditional four
man debate structure. ~r’
"'"The. third type of debate
offered-"iwiII be Parliamentary
Debate. This debate endeavors to

 introduce a bill, debate its merits,

Dippikil

and then try to get it passed or
defeated. All participants in the
tournament will take part in one,
massive round of Parliamentary
debate.

The time periods for all the
styles of debate will be ﬂexible
and determined by the debaters.

The debates will all be ﬂexible
enough to allow the switching of
team mates

Immats to highlight

I tournament

not appearing for a designated

round.

Most importantly, there will be
no win or loss decisions at
Dippikill. All debaters will iud e
one another and endeavor to he p
each other in a constructive
manner without awarding a “win”
or a "loss." At the conclusion of
the tournament awards will be
presented to the debaters.

Washington bus saga

Continued from page 1

By 9215, all of downtown
Washington, including the corner
of 14th and I had been tear gassed.
Consequently the D.C. police told
the bus company to pick up their
passengers at a park near the
murky Potomac River and the
Jefferson Memorial.

Two of the buses seemed to
have had hearing problems and
returned to 14th and l inspite of
the directives. These buses were
quickly loaded once again by
soggy people. However, this time
it wasn‘t a friendly rain. but bitter
and uncontrollable tears.

Bus number eleven
over-burdened and understaffed
roamed the streets. “Any students

from, Albany....This is an Albany

5.

Almost everyone on the bus
was crying. The people’s army had
been dealt a serious blow. The
evening had shattered the mud of
the afternoon’s City on a Hill.

Eventually all the lost people
and all the buses came together
and sorted themselves into their
original combinations.

Eight people were unaccounted
for...(all located by Sunday
evening); one student had been
arrested and released on $25 bail
(charged with refusing to move
when instructed by a peace
ofﬁcier). The buses returned to
Albany 7:30 am. on Sunday.

The people slept and cried.

Library submits new ﬁnes
for Univ. Senate approval

by Nancy Durish

The agenda of the November
meeting of the University Senate
held on Monday afternoon
consisted of Council reports, a
report of the Ad I-loc
Consultation Guidelines
Committee. and the introduction
of a number of bills sponsored by
student senators.

Library Council, urtder the
chairmanship of Morrison
llaviland, submitted its report
concerning the allocation of
library funds, circulation
regulations and the proposed
revision of the litre schedule. The
new schedule reads as follows:

Circulation Desk: On all overdue
books, a firtc of $.50 per day for
the first Week plus $.25 per day
after the first week will be
charged. The fine is accumulated
tnttil the book is rcttrrned or
reported lost. and will be citt in
half if paid when the book is
returned.

For a lost book. the student
will be obligath to pay the cost
of the book plus a $5.00
processing fee and all fines
accumulated before the book is
reported lost.

Failure to rclurri a book
requested b‘ the library for
another boriorrcr will cost the
student $1. per day if he fails to
rclurn it within three days front a
campus address and one week
from an off-campus address.

Ittrscrrrc lion/r Des/r: A student
will be charged $1. for the first
hour and 5.35 for each following
hour for failure to return
materials.

Also approvcd by the Library
Council was the application of the
regulation to faculty as well its to
students that books be recalled
aftci two wccks if rcqticstcd by
another lltll'lthL‘l'.

Discussion followed the
submission of lhc report and
Lenny Kopp introdticcd a motion
to send lltc rcport back to Library
(‘ouncil for revision. The motion
was defeated 41-22. The
regulations. including the fine
schedule. will go into effect next
SL‘lllCSlCl if given lhc approval of
President Kuusisto.

A bill for art invcsligation of
the Albany High School
incidcritwas introduced by
strident Senator Stcve Villano.
The bill’s resolution asked that
the University Senate call upon
lltc New York State Commission

November 12th incident at the
high school in which several
University students were involved.

Immediately after reading the
bill, discussion ensued and Dr.
Kuusisto introduced Dr. Harry
Hatiiilton, head of Albany’s
NAACP and Director of the EOP
Program ill the University, to
answer any questions and to
express his own views on the bill.

Dr. Hamilton first started the
possiblity of the bill being invalid
since. to his knowledge, only
parties directly involved in the
incident may ask for a Human
Rights Commission investigation.

He then went on to assert the
probability that such an
investigation will take place
anyway. especially since
numerous lawsuits will be
instituted by the parties involved.

A full report on the incident is
now being formulated. according
to Dr. Hamilton. and will be
released hopefully in the near
future, He stressed the fact,
however, that the University
whottld not remain in an ivory
tower but should take a stand on
the issues involved in tlieincident.

Villano then withdrew his bill.
and stated his dcsirc lo fomtulatc
another bill to express the
sentiments of the University
Senators on the issue. and present
it at the next mccling.

In other action, Doug
Goldschmidt introduced a motion
asking Student Affairs Council to
look into the question of using

Admininistration discusses '

housing, ‘Vietnam village’

by Perry Silvemran

Questions concerning the
availability of Indian Quad
dormitories for student residence
and the controversial “Vietnamese
village" constructed on campus
during the week of the November
Moratorium were discussed by
administration ofﬁcials at the
President‘s conference with the
students on Monday.

On the subject of Indian Qirad
housing, Acting President
Kuusisto presented a letter sent to
Walter M. Tisdale. Assistant to the
President for Planning and
Development from the New York
State Dormitory Authority.

The letter stated that the first
six low-rise units, scheduled to
open between March and May
1970, will be probably be
available no earlier than July,The
last two low-risers and the

University facilities for
demonstrations. and to draw up a
list regulations, denoting exactly
where demonstrations may be
held. The motion, sparked by the
controversy over the Vietn mi
huts dtrring the Moratorium, was
defeated, 30-25.

cafeteria would be completed at a
later date.

Kuusisto, therefore, concluded
that Indian Quad would not be
available for residence earlier than
fall 1970.

The “Vietnam village"
con troversy was discussed by Dr.
Clifton Thorrte, who was

responsible for the university
administration during the
November Moratorium wlulc

Kuusisto attended a conference.
The request to build the straw
huts was initially submitted to
Tltornc for the construction of
the village on the Campus Center
mall and the eventual destruction
of the village by burning.

This request was changed to
building the village on the
Academic Podium; the huts would
not be burned. Dr. Thorne then
mentioned receiving numerous
message by persons objecting to
the village. including threats to
burn it.

He also described receiving
anonymous phone calls from
persons who had claimed
attending a meeting in which
plans for burning the village were
fonmilated and a film concerning
the methods of disabling police
vehicles were shown.

Acting to protect people and
property, Thornc reached an
agreement with those responsible
for erecting the huts to move the
village back to the Campus Center
mall, where the “Vietnam village"

would be displayed, but nor
bumed as a part of the display.
This action was taken in
consideration of the fact that the
Lecture Center roof, upon which
the village was now located, was

made of heat-damageable
materials.
Thorne described being

contacted later by William O'Kain
who, claiming to represent the
"village" group, requested
permission to move the huts to
the Academic Circle. This request
was denied on the grounds that
the location of the huts on the
“front door" of the university
would create antagonism.

O'Kain’s position as a
representative was refuted
afterwards by Don Carrier who
asserted that O’Kain was not
reflecting the views of the group.

The group, however, was not
entirely in favor of the removal
of their huts to the Campus
Ccntermall, even in the face of an
arson attempt on their “village.”
The huts were taken to the mail
by university personnel on
Wednesday when members of the
“village” group did not appear to
remove the huts.

An effort by this committee to
return the huts to the Podium, in
violation of the agreement, on
that Thursday brought another
meeting with Dr. Thorne in which
it was finally determined that the
huts would be disposed of at 4:30
p.rn. of the same day.

McCarthy fears military machine
with its great power of domination

by Kenneth Deane

“If there is not a significant arid
immediate change in structure and
character of the American
political system, then this nation
will ultimately find itself entirely
dominated by the military
establishment. The ever expanding
efforts of the Dcfcnsc Department
will transform it into a garrison
slate." These prophetic words
were spoken by Dr. Terrance
McCarthy. a former professor of
economics at Columbia
University. in a lcctirrc preserttcd
at Draper Hall. on Saturdin
evening.

McCarthy called for the
creation of a third political party.
whose declared goal would be
“the dismantling of the
instrument of war--the
Department of Defense." And he
foresees that unless such action is
immediately undertaken. liberty
and the democratic institutions in
America will be at an end.

The lecture was entitled “The

Growth of the Garrison
Economy" and was sponsored by
the Non-Violent Action Group, in
support of the November 15th
War Moratorium.

McCarthy's lecture drew an
ominous and despcrate picture of
this nation‘s fultrre as it free and
democratic state. According to
McCarthy, the military has
mushroomcd in size and power so
that it is now independent of the
federal government.

Despite Defense Dcpartmnet
statements, according to
McCarthy, this nation is unable to
afford the Vietnam war. In
actuality we are a nation of

limited resources and productive
capacity. And that the federal
government in attempting to fund
the war is destroying our
currency, forfeiting social progress
and allowing the nation to
become further entrapped in the
invidious tentacles of “the lustful
Pentagon."

McCarthy fears that once the
conllict in Vietnam is at an end,
the government will feel free to
counter the Soviet threat in the
Middle East. Such a calculated
maneuver by the government
would serve to gragment the peace
movement and thus strengthen
the military establishment.
