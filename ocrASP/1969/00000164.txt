For Stiff 22 Game Slate

The era of Rich Margison is
over at Albany! During his tenure
the team won 51 out of 68 games,
last year ranking third in the
NCAA College Division, Eastern
Regionals after completing the
regular season with 2117-5 mark
and 18-6 overall.

Coach Dick Sauers, in his 15th
year as head Basketball Coach,
will attempt to regroup his forces,
with two returning starters,
transfer students, last year’s
freshmen, and returning
lettermen.

The two returning regulars are
Captain Jack Adams and Junior
Jack Jordon. Adams has averaged
10 and 9 points respectively in
two varsity campaigns. He will
probably start at guard. Jack
Jordon averaged 12.5 points per
game last year and will get one of
the starting assignments at
forward.

Three transfer students who
will be counted on heavily this
year are Steve Sheehan, Allan
Reid, and Jim Masterson. Sheehan
was a star at Hudson Valley
Community College where he
averaged 18 points per game. The
6’2" center will share the pivot
duty with sophomore Mike Hill.
Reid was the most valuable player
and Tri-Captain of Broome Tech‘s
25-6 powerhouse. The 6’2"
forward should see a lot of action.
Masterson averaged 8.6 as a
freshman at Ithaca and will get a
starting assignment at guard.

The squad is rounded out by
Ed Arseneau, John Heher, Les
Newmark, J. Quattrocchi, Bob
Rossi, and Jim Sandy.

Coach Sauers stressed that the
team has a potentially ﬁne
defense and that if the offense can
score with consistancy the team
should finish well.

CAPTAIN JACK ADAMS Will lead this year’s varsity basketball squad.
The team will open its 22 game regular season schedule on Tuesday.

December 2 at Williams College.

Grapplers Face
Depth Problem

The Albany State varsity
wrestling team opens their 1969
season on December 6 as the host
contingent for the Albany
Quadrangular Meet. .The
opposition in attendence Will be
Union, Rochester and Williams.

The junior varsity team will .not
begin their season. This is mainly
because there is no j.v. squad.
Apparently, not enough wrestlers
went out for the team to ﬁll the
lineup. According to Coach Joe
Garcia, “We have one of the ﬁnest
wrestling rooms in the country,
ﬁne conditioning facilities and
play a top-ﬂight schedule and it’s
a shame that we can’t attract
enough wrestlers."

Because of this lack of interest,
the team lacks depth in several
weight classes. This creates
problems in that there is no
competition for the respective
starting berths, hence, the
wrestlers would tend to progress
at a slower rate.

The 118 lb. weight class is
completely open. Wrestling at 126
pounds are Mark Zilkomki and
Paul Kula. At 134 pounds is Jeff
Albrecht while lettermen Pete
Ranalli and Kevin Roach weigh in
at 142 lbs. Occupying the 150
pound class are honorary captain
George Hawrylenak and Alex
Domkoski. At 158,167 and 177
lbs. are Bobby Kind, Bob Clayton
and Jim Renton, respectively.
Mike Muellar, who was
heavyweight champ on last year’s
AMlA tournament, is a candidate
for the 190 lb. slot as is Tim
Coon. The heavyweight class is
ﬁlled by Curt Witton.

Obviously, there is not
sufﬁcient competition in the
weight classes. Only by the
wrestlers fighting to start in the
meets will the learn improve.
Coach Garcia says it is not too
late to come out for the sport.
interested men should contact
him.

Children:

Love your mother?

by Kevin J. McGii-r

Human emotions, the War in Viet Nam, and the movement
towards ending the war...

Washington DC. was the biggest love-in ever held in
Ame:...;. Everyone offered you food, tried to keep you
warm, and constantly smiled at you; it was the spirit of
Christmas. My body was cold but my heart was warm. All
the children were there. All the children who are unsure of
their love for mother America. Some of the children are not
unsure--some love mother very much and others, very
frustrated, are constantly expressing their hate. In case you
didn't know, the love children were wearing helmets and
carrying guns.

Washington is a magnificent city with its huge edifices
standing so proud and strong. Heavy glass, tall gates and
deep underground, all of which houses those of the children
who wish to be housed. Many of the children swoon to
mother’s breasts. Her breasts are full; oh Wall Street oh
mother.

The hateful children are spoiled. They broke: windows
and splatter paint on mother’s physical anatomy. They are
so spoiled that they are willing to put their brothers, their
brother brothers who are unsure of their love for mother, in
jeopary of being hurs. Here comes another
tear gas cannister. Did anyone see Norman
Mailer around? I

Come together children; come together}

All the children are asking, “What effect.
do these moratoriums have on the powersl
that be?” Spiro Agnew, one of mother'sl
nurses, doesn‘t want it to have any effect.|
He says the media are controlled by a'
fralernlly of mew-probably those children

. I
who are unsure of their lovc--and they arcI
perverling the news. Spiro is right but he.
wants ll perverted even more. I

Hundreds of thousands said lhal it was a I
peaceful march. Attorney General Mitchelll
said that it was a violent march. The New
York Times, the perverted media, reports
what Mr. Mitchell has to say. The children, I
all the children are reading and reactingl
Abbie Hoffman estimates a million and (1|
half people at the march, Washington poll'ch
chief estimates 300,000 peoplc--the New'
York Times reports the police chief‘sl
rsllmale. I

All the children are emotional. Many of.
the children are unsure of moraloriums. Last |
week's moratorium on campus was not asl
successful as the October l5lh moratt rlum. I
Although, more are marching each march
and as lhal silent majority dwindles they will I
become more expressive; they have children I
who truly love mother, they are emotional, I
they may decide to prove their love, lheyl
have guns.

The emotions of our children do change;'
but more children must refuse mothers
breasts to keep the Christmas spirit alive.

..'.the discretion rests   I
businessmen, not moralisﬁ 

by Paul Mann

The Sacred and the Profane

it is not a question of what ought to be done,
but of what is the course laid out by business
principles; the discretion rests with the business
men, not with the momlists. and the business
men‘s discretion is bounded by the exigencies of
business enterprise. Even the business men
cannot allow themselves to play fast and loose
with business principles in response to a call
from humanitarian motives. The question,
therefore, remains, on the whole, a question of
what the business men may be expected to do
for cultural growth on the motive of proﬁts.

---Thorsten Veblen

“I sure am (for peace). I sell peace all year long. I
have a city permit to do it. I’ve made a fortune of
it." Remarks to the reporter of a street vendor
selling peace buttons and decals on the comer of
NW 10th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue on Friday
, morning, Nov. 14.

The quote from Mssr. Veblen comes from The
Theory ofBusiness Enterprise, published in 1904. if
one understands its implications one also
understands who the antagonist has been, and is, in
the various rounds on the moratorium circuit. The
highest hopes of those who marched on Washington
this weekend might possibly be realized if a
majority of the people in this spiritual Disneyland
of ours recognized the fact that the Vietnamese War
is not the disease, it's the sympton. The disease (i.e.,
the dissenters‘ antagonist) is homo economlcus. For
you may be sure that if the representatives of
paternalistic corporate enterprise gathered together
tomorrow and decided that the Vietnamese war was
not in the economic beneﬁt of the nation, the war
would cease forthwith. However, peace, like war,
must be sold to the public (“Three peace buttons
for only $.75," shouts the street vendor) and the
propaganda campaign for peace is not yet in full
swing. Peace doesn’t have enough buyers yet to
warrant a halt on the selling of the war. The motives
of proﬁt are still enjoined with a continuation of
battle. Know thou homo economicus.

The adjunct to all this is that the marchers at the
moratorium were foolish to heap their vituperations
upon the distempered ear of Oedipus Nixon. The
Man With No Eyes is only the bra for the saurian tit
of business. Thosewhc bombed Chase Manhattan
Bank came closer to the source of the disease in

In this computer age
the best judge of beer

is still...a man!

Although precise, modern machines control the
quality of Genesee Beer from start to ﬁnish, over
3,000 checks each week are made by people at the

hops and head, and malt and mash and

America than did those who marched on
Washington. Unfortunately, exploding glittering
metropolitan buildings of the super-rich i'n'to rubble
is stupid and puerile, however, healthy a catharsis it
may be for the human psyche. it only reinforces the
case for men like Nixon.

So it appears that we must become businessmen
too, we must learn how to sell peace, or rather show
the business men how they may sell it at their
proﬁt. Men like the street vendor selling peace
buttons are an outrage, but apparently one of the
inescapable facts of life is that it costs money to
haVe a soul. And while we may dicker with our
consciences on the moral validity of selling peace,
while we stand about in the muck and rain and tear
gas and profound gloom in moratoriums, men in
Vietnam are still going to their graves like beds.
There only remains one quasi-metaphysical question
beyond these facts. Could peace possibly, by any
stretch of the imagination, be made more proﬁtable
than war? 

The Donnybrook at the Justice Department

At 329 Pennsylvania Avenue,. near the Capitol
Building, in downtown Washington, there in a bar
called the "Hawk & Dove. " Inside the bar there is a
clock hanging from the ceiling with the following
words printed on its facia: HARRIS'S
MORTUARY

So once more into the breach dear friends, like
Hank Cinq’s army. Tis Saturday morning and Good
friday's Anglo-Saxon gloom has dissipated. it is a
bright, clear, cold morning in the nation's capital, a
brisk 36 degrees.

No trouble as yet in the moratorium, although
Friday night there was a slight skirmish over at
DuPont Circle (where Washington's homosexuals
allegedly. reside) near the South Vietnamese
Embassy .

Saturday's mood, it turns out, is far less somber
thanFriday’s, more like a festival, a carnibal, a
Roman holiday. There is a genteel whiff of Balkan
Sobrainie pipe tobacco in the air and three collages
of students have got campﬁres going down in front
of the circumcised Capitol Dome. The reporter and
his friend drink deeply of the morning mists, trying
to recover from the effects of a heavy overdose of
bourbon last night, in attempts to alchoholically
liquidate the accumulated’ despairs of Spiro T.
Agnew's (Nixon’s f mental hitchiker) Thursday
debacle; the despair of catching the National Guard
sneaking a squadron in the back way belting the
Lapitol at midnight; and the despair of having been
intimidated all Friday afternoon by the FBl,Secret
Service, and other police provocateurs over in front
