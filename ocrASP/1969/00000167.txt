ALBANY STUDENT mes

Wiversity Concert Band
gives performance tonight

by IrisSobei

“When i ﬁrst came here six
years ago the band had only thirty
players. At that time we had to
take anyone who could play. Most
of the players were just beginners.
Only four or ﬁve really played
well. We had practically no
instruments and rehearsals were
only once a week.

Then three years ago we were
what I would consider a good high
school band. We began to be more
selective in choosing our
members. During the next couple
of years competition became
greater and greater. Today we not
only have 75 ofthe best players
on campus, and the best
instruments, but our band has
become one of the best ‘college’
bands."

Thus spoke William Hudson,
who is the teacher, musician,
conductor, and man responsible
for the progress of the band in the
past six years.

Rehearsals take place twice a
week and are mandatory. “There
is no such thing as a cut. Timejust
does not permit it."

it takes about two and a half
months for the band to prepare
for a performance. Pieces are

chosen with the players in mind.
“i hope that each performance
will be a learning experience,"
says Mr. Hudson. “The piece
should improve the performance
of the students. It should present
them with a challenge and should
be of a higher quality than those
pieces played in high school
bands. i try to stay away from
transcriptions as much as possible
and center on contemporary
music written expressly for
hand.”

The types of pieces that Mr.
Hudson considers appropriate for
a college band can be heard in the
band‘s performance Friday night,
November 2|. At that
performance the band will play
four pieces written for band:
“Festivo” by Vaclav Neihybel,
“Chester Overture for Band" by
William Schuman, “Festive
Overture-Opus 96" by Dimetri
Schostakovitch and “La
Compars" by Lecuona. The
University Percussion Ensemble
under the direction of Thomas
Brown will also perform. The
concertwill take place in the Main
Theatre of the Performing Arts
Center.

The band usually ives three or

Songs Of Experience

four concerts a year. Soloists from
the music faculty and from the
outside community often appear
with the band in concert. The
band also takes part in many
other school activities such as
Freshman Convocation, Alumni
Day, and Graduation Day. Last
year it performed at the
Convocation of the Arts upon the
opening of the new Performing
Arts Center. It also performed at
the school dedication.

What does the future hold for
the University Concert Band? Mr.
Hudson hopes to take the band on
tours to various cities. The band
got a wonderful reception when it
performed at Expo ‘67. He would
like to see it do more things of
that type. He also hopes to form a
second band next year, “for those
players who are not quite good
enough for the first band."

Mr. Hudson is proud of the
progress the University Concert
Band has made in the past six
years. This progress has depended
not only upon his leadership but
upon the students themselves.
Together they have made the
band one of the ﬁnest college
bands existing today.

New trends in music

revealed at

by Alan Lasker and
Glenn Schechtman

Though Thursday night’s
beginning lacked substance, it
progressed into a stimulating and
creative performance. For the first
time, the American String Trio
harmonized “Tarok” together
after many individual rehearsals.
The impression of the three
musicians playing simultaneously
was similar to three orators stating
their personal views, not caring to
listen to what the other two had
to say. Is this relevant? This is for
you tojudge.

Pianists Findlay C‘ockrcll and
Dennis i-lehnrich set a feverish
pace, at times strumming on
the piano strings to produce a
lyre-like effect

Friday night's concert was
infinitely more bizarre. Musicians
were absent, replaced by a tape
recording of sounds mystique
knOWn to the audience as
“Bohor.” I found myself riding a
subway going nowhere. Strains of
a nightmarish funeral dirgc
followed. l was transported
suddenly to a carnival, empty and
isolated. facing the foreboding icy
winds alone.

The next selection “America's
Finest llour," had a sole liutist
accompanying tapes, films, and
slides. It was a perverse, gory.
display of a woman taking a (Li.
Joe doll to bed amid comments
on the Vietnam War by our
president.

Another selection, “TI(“‘
found eight musicians and
vocalist responding to a lilm of
unrelated sequences - from
Batman to an orange being peeled.
The indecisive audience was
unsure of their reactions to the
events on stage. Sonic were
laughing, sortie were crying.
Othersjust sat there stunned.

Contemporary music by nature
is a sensitive medium in which to
express one's inncr emotions of
fear, disgust. love and ecstasy. It is
music born into an age of
disillttsiornncnt providing lullabics
for thicr fears and ballads for their
protests. it bites into thcjoys and
the ills of the world.

‘Spectrum’

by Warren Burt

One aspect of the new music to
come is the reduction of
importance of the note, or the
fixed pitch, and the concentration
on sound as an element in itself.
This new aesthetic has been
largely the result of the new
electronic instruments, one of
which was John Eaton‘s Syn/rel,
His concert on this rernarkabie
instrument on November It
showed the many microtonal and
pttre sound possibilities of the
instrument.

Along with the trend to
concentrate on sound per sc is the
increasing tendency toward the
inclusion of other media than
sound in music. The Sonic Arts
Group, which appeared on
Wednesday night, gave some
extremely interesting examples of
this, among which were Robert
Ashley’s entertaining “Orange
Desert” for two girls and
electronics, and Alvin Lucier‘s
“The Only Talking Machine of its
Kind in the World." On the level
of pieces that dealt with sounds,
Gordon Mumma‘s "Hornpipe"
and David Behrman‘s
“Runthrough” stood as lovely
examples of thc performed music.

Thursday night’s concert was a
salute to tradition, with most of
the pieces playing involving
various phases of the older ideas
that dwelt on working with
pitches as one of the tnorc
important parameters of the
composition. Among the more
notable pieces in this program
were the Lawrence Moss
“()maggio" for two pianos. and
the very lyric and melodic
Schoenberg “String Trio."
Regrcttably, I found the Babbitt
“Vision and Prayer," supposedly
one of the classics of serial
writing, boring, dull and pointless.
It must also be mentioned here
that soprano Janct Stcclc gave an
absolutely gorgeous performance
on this night, as she did on Friday
night.

Saturday night‘s performance
by the (motive Associalcs of
Buffalo, a group headed by Lukas
boss and lciarcn Hitler was. in
effect. a kind of rccapitulalion of
all styles shown in the festival.
And especially notable in this
performance was a piece by i.lli\tl5
Foss called “Paradigm.” anti a
very light, whimsical piccc of
inlcrmcdia by Lcjarcn Ilillcr
called "Avalanche."

All in all, the festival covcrcd
just about every aspect of what is
going on in music today. And
especially line were the
compositions which involved what
I regard as music's Ilopcs for the
future, namely the addition of a
compositional visual
parametcr-intermcdia, and the
abolition of the note as the
primary important element of
music; the concentration mstcad
being on sounds in themselves.

The wind is from the west at
about 15 knots skidding across
the dry frozen tundra. It’s
.somewhere between 20 and 30

lost our only thermometer). We
know it’s above 40 below because
our wash water when thrown out
doesn’t snap and freeze before it
hits the ground.

Five hours to make 50 miles.
At our proposed rate we should
take five days to make the 240

The sun, straining hard, reaches

The cost of the Expedition will
be high. So, we’re currently
seeking out assistance in form of
grants and projects; departments
and organizations would like us to
carry out in the Arctic.

This Expedition is the
culmination of three years of
experimentation and preparation

most advanced techniques and
equipment we plan to be
moderately comfortable and well
fed during the entire trip.

procedures should play in the running of government. Whether or not
he was right was inconsequential: the crowd did not want to hear this.

Arlo Guthrie delighted the crowd, both by refusing to make a
speech, and by singing instead. His one barbed remark brought forth
spirited applause-“There’s no need for any more speeches, for any
more points to be made. The only point was already made by the US.
government when they showed us the guns and troops they imported
here to protect them from us. ‘

.Dave Dellinger got his share of applause and attention, even when
Calling for the group to join himself, “Jerry Rubin and Abbie
Hoffman in a march to protest the trial of the Chicago 8,at 5 pm. at
the Justice Department.” '

An anti-war G.I., editor of an underground military newspaper,
roused the passions of the crowd with a super-emotional plea. He
went so far as to assert that if Richard Nixon did not bring the troops
home soon, “they will come home themselves!“ He received a
prolonged round of applause.

Dick Gregory established great rapport with the crowd through his
running monologue on Spiro Agnew-—who was the brunt of many
jokes this afternoon.

Sprinkled throughout the program of speakers were many folk
singers like Peter, Paul and Mary, Pete Seeger, Richie Havens, Tom
Paxton, and John Hartford. One of the more emotional and successful
songs was the simple rendition of ‘Give Peace a Chance’ by Seeger and
the entire crowd.

By 3 pm, however, after 2 hours of rallying, the crowd was
becoming restless and even more so, exceedingly cold. ,

Many began leaving for home, and others, who had bosses to wait
for, left in search of warmth and shelter.

' Radical activity was conﬁned to cheers and waving of flags during
this time, but plans were being made for demonstrations at the Labor
Department supporting the GE. strikers, and at 5 pm. at the Justice
Department, in protest of the trial of the Chicago 8.

At 5 pm. the major rally was nearing its end. Down the street,
however, the rally at the Justice Department had become more than
another rally.

Few demonstrators were actually taking part in the rally; most were
merely observing. They together numbered about 5,000. The radicals
got to the building and after some confusion, rocks were thrown,
windows smashed, and a Viet Cong flag raised in place ofa US. ﬂag.
The police moved in, using tear gas as their major weapon. Arrests
were made, and the tear gas continued to float about town.

Buses scheduled to leave from areas that had been gassed were
forced to change their positions, and a great deal of confusion took
tplace the next few hours as students searched frantically for their

uses."

All this while, the camera has been panning around town—from the
rally to the Justice Department, to the inner city and business district.

As the last students board their buses, the camera again pans
around DC. The monument grounds are now near empty; clouds of
tear gas can be seen all over.

The camera picks up Herb Klein, Nixon’s secretary, being
questioned. “What was the Administration’s reaction to the
demonstration today?" and Klein’s answer, “This is just one more
example of the right of Americans to dissent.”

The camera pans away—~the buses pull out, the students go home,
Washington returns to normal, classes go on—and so does the war.
