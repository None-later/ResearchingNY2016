Kuusisto stresses. “
environmental study

by Perry Silverman

A widensnging discussion
involving a varied number of
subjects characterized Monday’s
conference of Universtiy President
Allan A. Kuusisto with the
students. Academic topics
dominated this session of the
weekly conference.

Kuusisto first issued a
statement concerning Albany
State‘s involvement in
environmental studies, referring to
it as “one of the major cmphasisof
this institution.“ He described the
commitment of the University to
environmental studies in terms of
the various academic involvemerrts
on this campus in this field.

He said that the work of the
Atmospheric Research Center is

on an international level. In
addition, he referred to the
activities of Professor Robert

Rienow, who Kuusisto called a
"major publicist" on
environment, and Professor
Edward Cowley in the field. I

Dr. Rienow, of the Political
Science Department, will be
instructing a course on
environment in the spring
semester while Dr. Cowley,
Chairman of the Art department,
will be holding all “Environmental
Forum" as a course for credit.

With these activities in
environmental studies, President
Kuusisto expressed the hope that
the University Would become a
leading center in the field.

Kuusisto was later questioned
on whether or not he would sign
the Library Penalty bill passed by
University Senate. This bill would
have the effect of raising penaltics
on ovcrdric library books from
two to fifty cents a day. The
Acting President stated that he
had not yet signed tIrc bill and
was waiting for air advisory
opinion on llre subject.

Aside front academics, a
question was raised concerning
the student who was responsible
for burning one of the huts which
compriscd tIrc “Vietnam village.‘
that was constructed on campus
during the week of the November
Moratorium. The name of the
student and the charges pressed
against him were asked of the
administration,

Clifton Tlrornc, Vice President
for Academic Affairs dealt with
this question. He stated that the
strident will he charged with the
violation ofa university regulation

and will appear before the student
judiciary. In accordance with rules
established by- the student
government, the name of the
student in question will ‘not be
released.

The explanation of the reason
that this matter was not turned
over to the police provided by Dr.
Tlrorne involved the fact that the
arson law was not broken, so that
no plice action was required.

In addition, Thorne revealed
that an attempt to press arson
charges against the student in a
court of law might fail since he
was not advised of his rights by
SUNYA police after they had
taken him into custody.

Weiss speaks
next week

Dr. Paul Weiss, renowned
Jhilosopher, will speak here on
the subject of “Knowledge and Its
Object " Dr. Weiss‘ academic
career began with graduation from
the City University of New York.

From CUNY Ire went to
Harvard where Ire worked with
Alfred North Whitehead and
Charles I-lartshorne. Weiss and
llartslrorne co-edited a six volume
collection of the philosophical
writings of Charles S. Peirce.

Dr. Weiss continued authoring
such books as “World of Art" and
“Nine Basic Arts." Before writing
