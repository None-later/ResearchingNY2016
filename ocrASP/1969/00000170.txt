THE EVOLUTION OF ClNElIM

mighta passed through here a generation of youthful soul'- memory.
sometime. "—Arlo Guthrie searchers hoping to absorb their Another negative aspect is

ALICE’S RESTAURANT
radiates a naturalism that unites
two generations tltrouglrr the
common bond of humanism. The
link between Woody and Arlo's
generation is more than genetic
but spans a great era in the
development of American folk
music and personal maturation
that will continue on into inﬁnity.
In fact, Arlo's search for the selfis
essentially the same journey
Woody undertook years before;
only the music, lyrics and life
styles Iravc changed.

The same genetic strain that
joins father and son in the life
celebration also unties them in the
transmission of the fatal
Huntington‘s chorea that took
ﬁfteen years to destroy Woody.
Therefore an inescapable mood of
mortality and sadness pervades
this visual version ofArlo's talkin‘
blues irraratlron. All the beautiful
people in this film are rtrnrring out
of time in their attempts to
establish a meaningful life beyond
merely existing. Somehow they
can never quite cope with the
mundane realities and tensions
that pervert interpersonal
relationships witlr suspicion and
mistrust,

The story not only relates
Arlo‘s wandering quarrels with the
imagination molding educational
factories and the draft. but Ire acts
as a rrarrator-troubadour for the
expanded theme. The dissolving
marriage of Alice and Ray Brock.
whose Thanksgiving garbage
becarrre the catalyst for the wars
in the song-saga. is brought rrlt)
sharp focus.

Alice and Rrry are the aging

optimism. They offered the
church as a pseudo-sanctuary for
the freedoms of self expression
and joy. Yet the inevitable
tensions of communal living and
sexual selfishness interrupt Alice’s
loyalty to Ray whilcjealousy and
personal dissatisfaction finally
murder their once solid
relationship. The final extended
shot of a confused Alice gives the
song a deeper signiﬁcance. The
only things you can’t get at the
restaurant are Alice rind a sense of
self. The restaurant is a whistle
stop on the everlasting road to
being, a journey of uncertainty
that everyone takes.

Director Arthur Penn has
assembled a compassionate film of
soothing visual pastels and casual
performances that blend reality
and idealism into a strange brew.
Penn never abandons the pathos
and humor of the song as
demonstrated in the marvelous
garbage arrest and grit-splitting
draft physical sequences. The
gentle starkness of the
snow-whipped graveyard scene is
one of the most distrrrbirrg
moments irt films this year.

Ovcrsliadowing Penn's obviorrs
dedication is another of his
calculated forays into legend
projection 21 la BONNIE AND
CLYDE. l’enn cannot present a
realistic situation without
glamorizing it to the point of
absurdity. Therefore one begins to
doubt the purposes of his
corrtprrlsiorr to make Woody and
Arlo appear to be not only great
folk singers. but great folk heroes
as well. Woody doesn‘t need Penn
to prove his greatness. His music

THE
ASP

by Mark Grand

The Great Dane basketball
team continued its winning ways
in the same fashion it left off last
year by defeating Williams
College. 72-71 in overtime. It was
the opening game for both teams.

The major difference this year
is the fact that no one could look
to Rich Margison for the clutcir
basket; the lreriocs canrc from
Alan Reid. a 6’2” junior transfer
student front Broome Tech.

In the first nine minutes of play
Albany held a slirrr 9-7 let '1 but
scored 11 straight point. iii a
single surge in the following
minutes. State held a comfortable
34-21 lead at the intermission.

The Dane’s held onto its 13
point lead. btrt with abouth
minutes left of the game.
Williams. led by John Untcrccker
and Vernon Mainley, began to
slowly close in on the Danes.

With 50 seconds remaining.
Larry Ferraro hit on a jump shot
for the Eplrmen to knot the score
at 65 to 65. State played for the

 

final shop by freezing the ball btrt
the contest entered the overtime
period when senior Ed Arscrreau
nrissed from the corner.

At the outset of the overtime
period. Jordan. State

At the outset of the cvertirne
period, State senior Jack Jordan
and Williams Untcrccker
exchanged baskets, bttt Bri'rn
Burke hit on a jumper to give
Williams the lead 60-67. Jordan
then converted a free throw but
Mairrley Irii from the field to give
the Eplrman it three point spread.

Reid then took the spotlight
and the game from Williams as Ire
connected on tow junipch from
the field. giving the Great Drraes a
72-71 advantage with 20 seconds
remaining of the extra period.
Arserrearr then drew a charging
foul enabling the Danes to freeze
the ball for the remaining seconds.
