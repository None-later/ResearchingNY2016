establishing reality

USIA produces Silent Majority

WASHINGTON-(CPS)--In the shadow of the
Washington Mobilization against the War in
Vietnam, the United States information Agency
(USIA) has produced a film which attempts to
establish the actual existence of a so-called “silent
majority" of Americans who support the president‘s
Vietnam policy.

The USIA. which is directly responsible to the
Executive branch of the government. has shipped
the film. entitled “The Silent Majority." in nine
different languages. to l04 countries including
Vietnam. It took 12 days to produce the 15 minute
ﬁlm which cost $20,000 to make.

United States citizens are not allowed to view the
film or any of the material produced by the USIA
without an act of Congress. becausc the material is
not intended for American audiences and could be
considered politically in favor of the party in power.

Spokcsnicn for the USIA maintain that the
purpose of “The Silent Majority“ is to take the
“other side" to the people of thc world-~thc story
that does not get covered in the regular foreign
commerical press.

However, the film appears to have had a very
different effect on others, outside the agency. who
have viewed it so far. Two Congressmen important
to domestic and foreign information committees.
John E. Moss (D-Calif.) and Ogden R. Reid
(R-N.Y.). were quick to criticize the film after a
special showing in Moss‘ office.

Rcid indicated that he was “not entirely
satisfied" with the film while Moss told ncwmen
that the film indicates a subtle change by an agency
committed to informing to a commitment of
propaganda.

“That was not the role assigned to the agency."
commented Moss. “1 think it most appropriate to
show demonstrations for or against US. Vietnam
policy or both." he addcd.

“But here we are faced with a slogan. “The Silent
Majority“ and the film attempts to establish that as
fact. That's a very difficult thing to do."

To establish the reality of a “silent majority" in
Anicrica the film uses a Gallup Poll take
immediately following President Nixon's November
spccch. The poll. conducted by telephone. involved
500 randomly selected rcspondnnts from across the
country. At onc point in the film. Gcorgc Gallup
president of ilic American lnstitutc of Public
Opinion, is questioned by the film‘s Black
comincntnlor Wilcy Davis.

"hc sccnc is prcfaccd by Davis asking his
audience; “But how can Pi'csidcnt Nixon to“ that
those people support him? How docs hc Know that
they make 11p a majority? . . .Wcll one way to find
out what's on tlicir minds is to conduct
nationwide poll. I did the ncxt bcst thing. I talked

2:

FRIDAY. DECEMBER 5, 1969

with someone wno otrccteo a poll, a researcher
respected for his objective approach and renowned
for the reliability of his methods."

Gallup explains his method, and offers the
accuracy rate his organization has had conducting
previous polls as a means of substantiating the
legitimacy of this most recent poll. No other
evidence that the silent majority docs in fact exist is
offered during the remaining minutes of the film.

Two excerpts from the November speech are used
in the film. The first follows this lead-in:
“Washington. and in particular the White House, has
frequently been the focal point for groups
demonstrating for or against something or someone.
Peaceful protest is a citizens right under the US.
Constitution. President Nixon is aware of the
objections raised by the “vocal minority." both
responsible and irresponsible. Most of the visible
pressure on him has been from those who would
either get US. troops out of Vietnam immediately
or those who want a build-up to force a military
victory over Hanoi."

The film cuts to the part of Nixon's speech where
he referred to former President John F. Kennedy, a
recognized “friend” to many foreign countries
during his term of office. Congressman Allard
Lowenstein (D-New York) criticized President
Nixon on natinal television following the President‘s
speech for what he thought was a misuse of the
words and thoughts of a man who could not have
known the ultimate consequences of his sending
15,000 "advisers" into Vietnam in 1963.

At another point in the film. footage showing
Nixon the morning after his policy speech. behind
the now famous “telegram-covered" desk is used as
Davis reads over the picture: “Public reaction to the
address was prompt. And some of those regarded as
thc “silent majority" brokc their silence. The White
Housc reported the President received tliotisands of
telegrams. of which 90 per cent reportedly cndorscd
his statement. Many other citizens communicated
by mail. The White House says it received thousands
of letters and postcards. the vast majority
.supporting the President on Vietnam. In addition.
many people telephoned their support."

The film's main ptirposc seems to be to install thc
“silent majority" as a truism rather than inch
conjccturc on tlic part of the President. Aflcr thc
interview with Gallup. there are no qualifications
atiaclicd to the lcrin “silent majority." for ihc
purposes of this film. aiid prcsumably for its

blinking Bureaucracy will attempt to answer students’ questions concerning University affairs. Questions
an be submitted by placing them in the ASP Classified Ad Box located in the Campus Center on the

information Desk.
Q: is it true that there are students whose tuition.
fees, etc. are paid for by the federal and state
governments in return for information about
narcotics offenses?

A: Dr. Thorne stated that to the best of his
knowledge, the answer is no. He also stated he
“would be willing to bet a year’s salary there are no
such people on any campus on any state university
campus in New York.“ However. he was quick to
point out that there are probably people off and on
campus—students and non-students —who inform to
the police on crimes of all types. “Without
informers," Dr. Thornc commented. “it would be
impossible for police to do their jobs." But he
doubted the police would ﬁnance their education.

He also reaffirmed the fact that as far as he
knows, there are no undercover agents of any type
on the SUNYA campus. “Before the F.B.i.. state
police. or Narcotics Bureau assigned narcotics agents
here, I would expect they would discuss it with
me.” he said. “And they never have.“ He did
mention that various police agencies do have
jurisdiction over the campus and could assign agents
here without his knowledge.

0: Are the campus records dealing with narcotics
offenses open to observation by the state police?

..
A: Official administration policy is that that
records are not public records and cannot be studied
without a court subpconu. Thus, the state police
would have access to these records only if they were
able to present enough evidence to obtain a court
order. If that happened. the university would be
powerless to prevent the state police from
examining them.

In dealing with law enforcement agencies. the
university cooperates only to the extent of
upholding the law. according to Dr. Thornc. He said
in dealing with drug abuses, the university iS “not
interested in operating a gestapo-like agency here on
campus. That’s not our purpose...“ However, the
university does not offer a “sanctuary for
lawbrcakcrsz" it sees itself as an upholdcr (as
opposed to a strict enforcer) of the law.

Q: What progress is being made in fulfilling black
student demands for more and betterjobs for blacks
in the university community?

A: A sttidcnl affairs committee is currently trying
to find ti solution for the problem. In the meantime.
all job openings in all areas are rotitcd through the
office of Dr. Spellinan. He keeps in touch with
employment agencies for qtialificd. non-white
applicants. They receive first priority.

Central Council’s action

Continued from page i ‘
way as the Basketball team has 1" it”
been. and with hopefully as much
success.

In other action Council tabled a
motion by Lenny Kopp (19-5-1) ‘ '
to hold a new referendum on ASSOCWIU“;
manditory Student Tax. The Alsov 'l
motion came as a result of a
petition circulated by the Young
Conservatives, requesting a new
referendum, that obtained I901
signatures.

Dan Duncan, chairman of the
Young Conservatives. said that he
would make no statement against
the manditory tax and that the
poll only sought a new
referendum on it.

He requested that if Council
should approve the referendum
that it be held in conjunction with
the spring Central Council
elections, because he felt that the
students would ltave had
sufﬁcient time by then to evaluate
the benefits of the tax.

Bill O’Kain. head of the Young
Socialists’ Alliance. was also there
in sup on of the motion.

Sure. Things are alot better. No more worrying for seven years
about whether or not you’re going to be drafted. Now you only bay:
to sweat it out for tWelve measly months. “Good luck. tonight.
“Thanks.” “This‘ll probably be the ﬁrst lottery l'll wm. 'Two-to-one
that my birthday’ll be picked after yours.” “Ah, well, born by chance.
die by chance.”

Stop. please in God's name. in somebody‘s name. stop. What’s
going on here? Has each and everyone of us lost our ability to feel
compassion? Have we become so morally battered by that abominable
war. so desensitized by the atroiocity of authorized murder, so
hypnotized by the American military mystique that we no longer
possess humane feelings toward one another?

What is the matter with us? We bemoan the fact that, yes, there
were abuses in the Selective Service System and yes, there are abuses
under the lottery system, but, “someone has to lose." Why can't we
realize as St. Clare did in Uncle Tom's Cabin that to talk about the
abuses of military service is like talking about the abuses of slavery.
"The thing itself is the essence of all abuse.” Compulsary military
service is its own abuse. Why, why. why, do we accept the awful
assumption that the only way one can serve one‘s nation is militarily?
Can I not serve myself and my fellow man as a lawyer. dont1st, social
worker or psychiatrist? Does a government have the right to deem
which people are occupationally more valuable than others? Why 1s1t
that at Nuremberg we told the Germans on trial that they had a moral
right to question their government and act according to the dictates of
their consciences. while we refuse to attach the same standards to
Americans who. acting on command. slaughtered infants as if they
were wild boars?

What has happened to us? Have our sensibilities become so mangled
that we now place absolute importance on being number ‘275 in the
draft lottery? Are we not all guilty of pulling the trigger in that game
of legalized Russian roulette?

Thc blatant acceptance of the military mctapliysic in America iS
numbing our spirit. perverting our ability to reason and decaying our
sense of humanity. Wc dropped an unnecessary bomb on Hiroshima
and were told that it saved the free world. We have killed 40.000.
Americans. one-half million North Vietnamese and who knows how
many South Vietnamese. in an Asian Civil War and we are told that
we‘re protecting democracy. And. we have accepted a lottery system
of drafting men into the armed forces which has led human beings to
cheer the fact that other human beings will be randomly selected to
die instead of themselves.

Slowly. but ever so surely. we are becoming a society of Camus‘
robot people. wrapped up in “things that matter". content to extst on
a little sex. a little food and a little money and quite willing to ﬂoat in
our own plastic capsules. ignoring all else that surrounds us and not
even stopping to think that if Jesus Christ were alive he (1 be number
84 in the lottery simplu because the government ofthc United States
feels that there is no better way to serve your own self-interest and
the interest of mankind then with a gun in your hand-even if your
name is Jesus Christ.
