A boycott of Albany County

organized by the Albany Black
Coalition started yesterday.

The “selective buying campaign
is an attempt to force area
merchants to exert pressure on
the municipal government. The
campaign is necessary to insure
that the Albany Board of
Education implement the reforms
which were promised to the black
community as a result of the
November l2 Albany High School

The ﬁve demands which the
black community feels can be

At his weekly conference with
students, President Kuusisto
announced that there will be a
meeting before Christmas of
representatives of all the State
University Units to discuss the
idea of the System going on an
open-admissions policy next year.
SUNYA is presently partially
under such a system with respect
to its EOP program. President
Kuusisto expressed hope that if
such a university-wide policy were
initiated it would be given enough
funds to make it a responsible and
effective one.

The maintenance staff has
fenced off the central portion of
the academic podium because it is
unable to keep the steps clear
during winter weather. They
would be a safety hazard if
students were allowed to use
them.

This university has received
clearance from the system-wide
Central Ofﬁce to accept bids and
began construction on a |60~unit
married students’ housing facility
which will be built on the other

side of Fuller Road. Construction
is expected to begin in the Fall.

Dr. Kuusisto was asked various
questions concerning the
Department of Rhetoric and
Public Address’s need for a
departmental chairman. Kuusisto
said the Dean of the College of

Arts and Sciences determined
whether or not there is money
available to pay a department
chairman according to the
priorities within the college. The
president said he was aware that
students were concerned about
the search and hiring of a
department chairman.

The student directories have
been shipped' by the printer and
are expected to arrive here
momentarily.

A question was raised on
CURE’s movement to eliminate
university-wide requirements. As
of yet no proposal has been
submitted to the Undergraduate
Academic Council and until such
is done no action can be taken in
this area.

Also discussed was the fact that
student senators were elected to
the Faculty-Senate after
appointments were made to the
committees. This has resulted in
lack of information and

concerning housing

by Nancy Durish

An investigation into the
matter of the so-called
“proposed” Lottery Housing
System brought before LAAC last
week has yielded many deﬁnite
answers to questions posed by
members of the University.

First, according to Steve
Lobcll, Chairman of LAAC, the
proposal is definitely NOT a
proposal but titerer a suggestion
drawn up by a member of the
residence staff of the university.
The suggestion is currently being

reality, only a small number of
students would be forced to tnovc
off-campus during the first few
semesters it would be in effect.

The suggestion, brought up
before LAAC by an administrative
group, caused a great deal of
discussion among members of the
Commission since they had never
before been confronted with the
plan.

Many members experesscd
doubt as to the exact stage the
proposal was in and
determination to discover why it

:1

scrutinized by the Housing Staff was not brought to LAAC's

along with many other helpful
ways to alleviate future housing
problems.

This suggested housing lottery
would involve a type of quota
system where the Housing Ofﬁce
would first determine the number
of space available for students. A
lottery. composed of the names of
all students desiring oncampus
housing facilities, would then be
held, the results determining who
remains on campus and who must
obtain off -cantpus housing.

If this stigge'stj‘op eyjerbgpgme a before LAAC for r,  !

attention by the Housing Ofﬁce.

Further inquiry into the matter
revealed that first the proposal
was merely a suggestion, and
second, that many other students
had read the suggestion and
assumed that LAAC was aware of

It.

Lobell stressed the fact that no
deﬁnite formulation of the lottery
housing system is going on at the
present time. He also state that
should the plan be formulated in
the.future, it will assgredly come

consequent problems in voting.
Hope was expressed that action
would be taken soon to remedy
this. It was noted that Senate
meetings are open to the public
and each council and committee
decides for themselves whether to
conduct closed or open meetings.

The President was also asked
when action would be taken on a
request from LAAC and Central
Council last year to give
preference to commuting students
in student parking lots. Kuusisto
said he wasn’t aware of this but
commented that since December
1 there has been a SUNYA bus
circling the campus on perimeter
road as a convenience to students.

against the draft

by Ben Johnson

If the ill fortunes of fate have
damned the day you were born
via the US. SelectiveService
System. your anxiety may be
lessend by efforts being made on
catnpus concerning what to do for
those branded with low draft
status.

The beginning activities of the
Anti-Draft (Anti-War) Steering
Committee of Student Mobe were
discussed last night at the ﬁrst
meeting of the special committe.
The plans are of a two-fold
nature: ﬁrst, efforts are being
made to attack the unfair and
war-permitting draft institution
itself with a demonstration ﬁrst
on December 12 at the Watervliet
Arsenal. _

There will be a rally and march
on December 15 beginning at the
State Capitol building at eleven

. . and proceeding to the
Albany Draft Induction Center a
few blocks away. '

The second part of the
committee's work consists of
forming a single cohesive unit of
students on campus who are
distressed over their draft status in
order to inform these individuals
as a group about what can be
donc speciﬁcally in the area of
draft counseling. '

A “Merry Un-birthday Party”
will be held on December 16 in
the Campus Center Assembly Hall
from 105 for the purpose again
of providing helpful information.

The goals of the committee
were thus set-up to mobilize as
large a group as possible for the
rally and anti-draft
demonstrations and to reach out
to the distressed students on
campus seeking help concerning
the fate of their draft status

M OBE tries people’s press

to show need for war’s end.

Student Mobilization
Committee is trying to raise $900
for a full-page ad in the Albany
Times Union sometime during the
holiday season to focus the
attention of the average area
citizen on the need for peace in
Vietnam.

Members of the University
Community may sign the petetion
and give donations to Student
Mobilization at the tablr in the
Campus Center lobby.

The text of the ad will read as
follows:

We the undersigned submit this
public statement to:

1) Demonstrate our opposition
to American involvement in
Vietnam. We uphold the right of
Vietnam to self-determination.
and demand an immediate and

2) Demonstrate our opposition
to the present procurement ofthe
lives of young‘ men by the new
draft lottery system. End the
draft and let the young men of
America use their lives for
constructive instead ofdeslructt'vc
purposes.

The spirit of the approaching
holiday season has always been
“Peace on Earth, goodwill
towards men." You. the average
American, can make this spirit a
reality. You can voice your
sentiment against the war and the
draft by sending letters to the
President of the United States.
and to the Selective Service
headquarters in Washington.
