lost to Stony Brook.

by Mark Grand

Nothing went right for the
Dane Courtmen Firday night as
they were soundly defeated by
Stony Brook in State‘s home
opener, 58-49.

Besides having an off-shooting
night, Albany was outreb'mnded
54-35 as the Patriots completely
dominated the game.

he poor shooting is
exemplified by the fact that
neither team scored during the
ﬁrst three minutes of the gatne.
However, Stony Brook center
Mike Kerr took charge and led
Stony Brook to an 11-2 lead after
the ﬁrst eight minutes of play.

Senior Jack Jordan and juniors
Alan Reid and Jim Mastersotl got
the momentum going for Albany
in a surge that brought the Dattes
to within tow points at halftime,
72-20.

STATE WAS Both outrebounded and outshot Friday night as they

  

---deyoung

the second half began with
State overtaking the Patriots and
leading for the ﬁrst titne 28-27.
That was the last time the Dane‘s
saw the lead as Kerr cotnpletely
controlled the boards while poor
shooting continued to plague
Albany. Senior captain Jack
Adams, team playmaker, drew his
fourth personal foul early in the
second half and saw limited
action. The result was a steady
increase in the Patriots lead until
the game was ﬁnally pttt out of
reach of the Danes with about
three tninutes left.

Kerr hooped 18 points for the
winners while Reid led the Great
Danes with 13 followed by Jordan
and ~Masterson with 10 and 9
respectively.

The only bright spot irt
Albany's game came on defense
wltere they exhibited tight and
aggressive play.

Sports Hash

by Dave Fink

 

 

Who do you think is the number one college football team in the

nation? It would'seem that your choice is just as good as the writers‘,
the “football experts," who determine the Associated Press and
United Press International rankings. What is meant by this is that it
has gotten to the point where it is ludicrous for a group of people to
arbitrarily (yes, arbitrarily) list the nation’s top twenty gridiron

powers.

Obviously, the question of who is number 1 is the foremost
concern. Having little basis for comparison, in that only rarely do the
top elevens square off. The “experts” have endeavored to combine a
series of intangibles (it rs possible that eVen they do not know what
these factors are) in order to produce, in their opinion, the best team
in the nation. For nine weeks this season and for many weeks before
the ‘69 campaign began, Ohio State not only was rated ﬁrst but was
being called possibly the ﬁnest intercollegiate football team of all
time. Then, all ofa sudden, after completely outclassing all opposition
for these nine weeks, it was Good Bye Columbus (pretty corny.
huh?). Michigan beat them 24-12 and magically, these experts forgot
about Ohio State, dropping them to fourth behind Texas, Penn State
and Arkansas of whom they had played none. Whether this move was
valid or not is questionable but assuming that it was, shouldn‘t
Michigan have then been given some consideration as number 1? After
all, they defeated a team that some people thought was the best ever.
If you beat the best, shouldn‘t you be considered among the best'.’
Obviously, this logical thinking never occurred to the “experts.”

Next, there is the case of Penn State, who ltave at this moment Won
22 consecutive football games. Last season, they were obviously
superior to their opposition but were continually ranked below tllc
University of Southern California and Ohio State. This season they
still have not lost but again, they have yet to reach the top. It seems
that the powers that be have a strong aversion towards teams front IIIt‘

northeast.

Please bear in mind that this is not to say that the team that is
number 1 is not a great team or that it might possibly be the best.
What it is saying is that there is no real basis for concluding who in

fact is the best.

In essence, it appears that the AP and UPI polls have been
established for two reasons; I) to satisfy alumni who will very eagerly
give donations to their respective Alma Maters when they see the
school in the top ten, and 2) to satisfy the fans‘ desire to have llrcir
minds regimented as to who is best and who is second best and so on.

To conclude, it seems obvious that these rankings mean little. Until
a means of having post season playoffs is devised similar to that used
in basketball (this is impractical because it is difﬁcult for a football
team to play five extra games in a season) we cannot possibly know
just who the national champion is. On New Year‘s Day, Texas will
meet Notrc Dante, Arkansas will face Mississippi, Penn State will play
Missouri and USC will go against Michigan. [fall the favorites (namcd
ﬁrst) lose, there's no telling who “the experts" would pick as their
number one team. Let it suffice to say that if one of the great minds
of our time, our Presidettt, was going to give another plaque to the
best, even he might not be able to decide to just whom it should go.
