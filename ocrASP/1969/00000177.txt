Central Council, last night,
voted 10-1-10 to hold another
referendum on the Manditory

. Student Tax.

T he impetus for this action was
the presentation to Council last
week of a petition containing
1901 signatures calling for this
new referendum. At that'timc
Lenny Kopp introduced the bill
that was passed tonight. The bill
had been tabled last week and
Kopp moved this week to remove
it from the table.

The new referendum will take
plaee this Spring semester,
probably in conjunction with the
Spring Central Council elections.

Political and Social Positions
Committee introduced an
Anti-Selective Service Bill that
asked Central Council to support
the rally and march to the Albany

Draft Induction Center on
December 15th.
The bill, which passed

unanimously, further urged all
faculty not to penalize students
who do not attend class on that
date.

PSP introduced another bill
calling for Council to endorse and
support the positions taken by the
Albany Black Coalition in the
statement entitled “Why We Must
Act "

Council voted to do so with the
exclusion of one demand in it
calling for “the dissolution of the
present student government
bodies at both Albany and
Schuyler (high schools),
immediately followed by new
elections in which proportioned
numbers of representatives would
be elected by black students."

The statement and its list of
live demands is a result of local
school officials taking action on
the changes desired by students,
parents, and the Black Coalition
in school procedures following the
violent incident at Albany High
School on November 12.

Other demands called for
included an evaluation of the
Albany Police Department by a
neutral agency, the revision of the
present Black liislory course
offered at the schools, the
retention of a qualified Black

<  reopens  tss ; e:

{spring referendumto- '

teacher at both high schools for
the Black History course, offering

the course to junior and senior '-

students.

They also demanded dropping
all charges against persons arrested
in connection with the incident at
Albany High on November 12
based upon the recognition that
these persons did not initiate the
disturbance and society can gain
nothing by the continuation of
the charges.

The statement and demands are
to be supported by a selective
buying campaign within the city
of Albany. Nothing is to be
bought from merchants in the city

of Albany, except in stores
operated by blacks. '
In other action Council

unanimously passed a position
statement on‘ the Library Fine
Schedule. The bill for the
statement, introduced by Mike
Lampert and Jean Turner,
proposed that Council petition
Dr. Kuusisto, Dr. O’Reilly, and
the University Senate to withhold
approval of the new library fine
slc9h7¢6hile for the Spring semester,

It further urges that they
investigate, make a new effort to
gather student opinion on this
matter, and reconsider the library
line schedule.

University Structure
Becoming Obsolete?

by Howie Schlossbei'g

State Quad’s lounge was the
scene Tuesday night of a formal
debate concerning the university
structure. Under debate was the
proposition, “The University
Structure is Becoming Obsolete.”
Supporting the proposition was
Dr. Curtis Smith of the English
Department and opposing it was
Dr. Anthony Saturno of the
Chemistry Department.

Dr. Smith‘s speech attempted
to convince everyone that the
University is serving the military
industrial complex and the status
quo. In essence he said that our
society is actually obsolete and
therefore. because the University
fits irilo this society it is also
obsoleter

He was disappointed that the
president of the University has all
the decision making powers which
he felt should be in the hands of
the students and faculty. Dr.
Smith' emphasized that the
University should be an
instrument of social change
instead of being responsible as it is
now to the military industrial

complex.
Dr. Saturno was very blunt in
presenting his side of the

argument and stated that the aims

lab

'POTTERY

 

SAVE EVERY DAY!
DIRECT IMPORTS 8r FACTORY PURCHASES of ONLY

the FINEST OUALITY NATIONALLY KNOWN BRANDS at
PRICES YOU CAN AFFORD!

GROOVY ASSORTMENTS of WOOD . POTTERY . WICKER ITEMS .

STEEL . BEADED CURTAINS . COFFEE MUGS . LOVE BEADS . INCENSE .
INCENSE BURNERS . CLOTH THINGS and a LOT of NICE STUFF for
YOUR ROOM or APARTMENT!

of the University are to turn out
professionals in various ﬁelds. He
then said that the University's
structure does not necessarily
impinge upon these aims.
Registration makes many courses
available to all students and the
library makes its reading material
easily accessible to the students
also.

Dr. Smith replied to this by
saying that although one learns a
trade at the University but does
not learn how to become a human
being. He added that a radical
change in the structure must come
now and that the students can
accomplish this change by using
their unrealized powers.

Following the debate period
the proposition was put on the
lloor for general discussion and
comment. Words llowcd freely
but nothing was suggested outside
of the scope of what had been
presented by the two main
speakers.

The proposition was then put
to the vote of all in attendance.
All persons agreed that the total
vote count, 20 in favor, 2 opposed
and 5 abstentions showed the
apthy of the student body toward
this signiﬁcant problem.
