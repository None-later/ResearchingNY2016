by Roy Lewis
New York State Attorney
General Louis J. Lefkowitz

addressed 150 students and area
residents Monday evening on the
subject of consumer frauds.
Lefkowitz spoke at theuniVersity
at the invitation of Delta Sigma
Pi, the Professional Business
Fraternity on Campus.

Lefkowitz’s opening comments
on consumer frauds were prefaced
by two reasons for the necessity
for public cornsumer protection.
First of all, Lefkowitz maintained
that consumer protection in
behalf of the public was essential
in order to protect the purchasing
power of the American citizen as
well as aid him in aining an
honest dollar’s worth of goods.

Consumer protection is also
equally important for the
reputable businessman. Lefkowitz
justiﬁed this assertion by pointing
out that defrauded customers
tend to patronize business less and
hence all business suffers.

Lefkowitz asserted that the
task of regulating business
procedures lies ﬁrst with the
businesses themselves.
Government intervention is only a
necessity in the cases where
businesses have failed to adopt a
reputable code of ethics. During
recent years business has begun to
regulate its practices since the
threat of government intervention
is now such a real possibility.

Lefkowitz made clear that an
educated public is the key in
detering frauds. His ofﬁce alone at
present is dispersing pamphlets,
ﬁlms and speakers on the subject
as well as introducing consumer
education courses in New York
State secondary schools.
Lefkowitz predicted that by
1971, every New York State high
school will have this type of
course available.

The bulk of Lcﬁtowitz’s lecture
concerned his various proposals in
combating consumer fraud. It was
Lefkowitz's assertion that
door-to-door sales are the number
one fraud in this country and that
being the case, he proposed that
the buyer should reserve the right
to cancel these sales up to 48
hours after purchase for whatever
reason whatsoever.

Unsolicited credit cards also
came under attack. Lefkowitz
urged that such cards be allowed
through the mails
requested in writing. it is his
contention that mass credit cards

~ carry adverse social and economic

effects. Primarily they provide an
excuse for rampid spending but
other problems connected with
their illegal use makes them
undesirable.

The licensing of television,
automotive and home
improvement repairmen was also
discussed. At present any
individual in New York‘ can claim
to be a television repairman and
hence the public interest is in
jeopardy. /

Clearly a license will force
business to think twice about
defrauding the public since its loss
could ruin many businesses.

For ’the holiday season,
Lefkowitz warned the audience to
deal only with local, reputable
merchants. Businesses and
bargains which appear only for
this season are generally
fraudulent and hence should be
avoided.

Lefkowitz spend the latter part
of the hour answering questions
from the floor. in response to a
question on civil rights and labor
unions, Lefkowitz claimed that
his ofﬁce has been the first to
probe labor unions in the ﬁeld of
civil rights and to attempt to
correct any inequities that may
exist.

Another question came from a
SUNYA student concerning the
legalization of marijuana.
Lefkowitz felt unqualified 10
comment on legalization, though
he did state that there are far too
many expert opinions and too few
answers.

A ﬁnal question dealt with the
costs of consumer fraud for New
York State residents each year.
While Lefkowitz maintained that
the exact costs could never be
calculated, he did say that over
$1,000,000 alone is defrauded
from the elderly for non-existent
tracts of land in Florida.

Governance
changes

continued from page I
though, these groups will be
subdivided into more homogenous
interest groups. The suggestion of
a liason, who could unite these
diverse groups, was brought to the
floor.

Also discussed was the fact that
undergraduates were being
cheated out of necessary funds,
since many departments are
constantly jockeying for funds for
pet research projects, such as the

neutron accelerator for the
Physics Department.
Finally, Mr. Thorstcnscn

stressed that freslnncn can play a
role in university governance, even
if they do not hold an elected
post. The university's committees
and Commissionsnced all the help
they can get; so freshmen might
offer their services without fear of
rejection.

The Vietnam war and the
effects of moratoriums on foreign
policy were among topics
discussed in a panel discussion
sponsored by NDC (New
Democratic Coalition),
Wednesday night. The featured
speakers were Doctors Edelman,
Hoffman, and Cohen, all of the
Political Science Department.

As ﬁrst speaker, Dr. Edelman
denounced US. policy in Vietnam
as one that “treats people as
things." He viewed the Me Lei
massacre as an extreme case but
nonetheless “consistent with the
underlying logic of our policy."

He drew a parallel between
passive Americans and the
so-called “good Germans” of
World War ll but warned that
Americans cannot plead ignorance
or fear as an excuse for inaction.

He then went on to decry the
fact that America was becoming
an “elitist society,” unable to be
penetrated or changed by her
citizens.

Dr. Hoffman was next and
expressed doubt that moratorium
activities would effect President
Nixon’s policies. instead, he
favored and saw Congressmen up
for re-election in 1970 as most
susceptible to change-especially
those in districts where doves are
in the majority.

His four-point plan for action

  debate: moratorium” 7 w
dwagreementhann comments I

included bi-monthly moratoriums,
letter-writing campaigns to
Congressmen, an all out effort to
elect a “peace Congress” in 1970,
and ﬁnally, thought to forming a
fourth party movement in 1972.

Dr. Cohen promptly rejected
the idea of a fourth party, citing
their relative lack of support in
American history. He favored
working within the system by

infiltrating and controlling one of

the two major parties.

in the meantime, he called for
more demonstrations and
moraioriums--especially on the
local level. He expressed fear that
if dissent tapered out, even the
token attempts of the president to
scale down the ﬁghting would
cease.

Soon after Mr. Cohen finished,
Patti Mann, another faculty
member rose and blasted the three
speakers for their lack of
relevancy. He accused them of
saying nothing the andicncedidn't
know already, and asked them
why they bothered to show up in
the ﬁrst place. His remarks
touched off a lively debate among
the audience.

Mann then continued: “Why be
repetitive by being here?" We
should be indicting ourselves.
Instead, we are only comforting
ourselves through conversation
that gives the illusion of control
over a situation in Vietnam which

sums“, mm  

we obviously do not have."

“ He. chastised moratoriums as
servmg as a happy get together
for‘ a weekend away from the
campus...Many went to-get drunk,

get laid, and get away from
campus."

Mann concluded by labeling
America “the Kremlin of the
Super-Rich” where “three percent
of the population control eighty
percent of the corporate wealth."
Thus, he saw it as worthless to try
to reform the views of the middle
class on the war.

I "Since politics is property and
since American politics is always
decided by a dollar sign at the
barrel of a gun,” he stated, “then
those who control property
control politics...are we run by
lobbies or Congress?"

“We are all bought and sold at a
marketplace by the power elites
of business."

Critique of Education Dept.
discussed by curriculum class

by Liz Elsesser

The Educational Curriculum
instruction 400 class met on
Wednesday for a special session to
discuss the present situation of
the Education Department and
the student teaching experience.
The involved students made a
great many suggestions and
constructive comments for the
improvement of the unorganized
state of affairs within the
department.

Two major points were the lack
of an undergraduate education
department to which complaints
could immediately be taken and
the limiting of student teaching to
just Milne High School.

First, it was felt that student
teaching should be to weeks and
full credit should be received with
grades being on a pass-fail basis.
The rest of the complaints dealt
mainly with the education courses
themselves and student teaching
facilities.

it seems the textbooks need to
be updated and teaching media
improved.

The reading material was
requested to be more selective and
conceptual rather than straight
factual knowledge. All seemed to
ardently agree that it was difficult
to relate readings to the ﬁve
determinants.

The lack of an undergraduate
Education Department was the
basis of a large portion of the
problem. One is desperately
needed to coordinate and
integrate activities and courses. it
was felt that more standardization
of requirements, guest speakers,
more schools for student teaching.
more seminars to discuss practical
problems, and in general more
ﬂexibility is needed.

As a group they also wish to see
more practice on undergraduate
level. such as courses geared
towards teaching slow and
culturally deprived learners.

One student felt the making up
of three lesson Inns in triplicate
was busy work. any then agreed
to the lnflixlblc and superficial

experience gained byjust teaching
in this one high school.

the Methods course should
have more discussion and
philosophy rather than the “tricks
and games" of teaching. Along
with this would be more specified
ﬁeld discussion.

The members of the education
department present seemed eager

to co—opcrate and willing to work
with the students. it is obvious
that teaching is a highly subjective
area in need of re-evaluation and
change.

Representatives will be chosen
for a discussion group and a list of
complaints will be presented to
the proper administration. Other
gripe sessions are planned and all
concerned are encouraged to
attend.

Phone calls will be accepted at
Operation Goodwill Headquarters,
465-1441, any weekday between
9 am. and 5:30 pm. and
Saturday between 9 am. and 5
pm. Messages can also be taken to
Fort Orange Radio Corp. at 904
Broadway, Albany.

Persons wishing to send
messages should give the operator
their full name, address and
telephone number, as well as the
complete rank, name and military
address of the serviceman to
receive the message.

Communications are taken over
the phone that is directly
connected to a tape recorder.
Senders should be prepared to
speak for at least 5 minutes.

Upon receipt, servicemen may
turn the tape over and record a
return message. He can then send
it back, postage free, to Operation]
Goodwill headquarters where it

will be forwarded to the
addressee.

interested persons are
encouraged to call early to ensure
arrival in time for the holidays.
More than one tape can be sent if
desired. There is no charge or
obligation to anyone.

 

NOTICE

There will be an important
meeting of majors in the
Department of Rhetoric and
