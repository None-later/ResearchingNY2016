admissions

to close in January

Frank G. Krivo, director of
admissions at State University of
New York at Albany; has
announced that, with the
exception of those from residents
in the Capital District, freshman
applications for the fall 1970
semester will close January 1.

Mr. Krivo stated that the
decision to close was based on the
fact that the university has
received approximately a 16%
increase in freshman applications
for the Class of 1974. Additional
facilities originally scheduled for
completion next fall will not be
ready in time to accommodate
students.

The admissions director added
that the problem is most crucial in
the housing area. There is a
University Council policy
requiring all frcsltmen under 21
and unmarried to reside either in
university housing or with their

arcnts. Accordingly, most

roshmen, outside of
theimmediute Albany area, must

required to commute while
attending the university.

Agnew ’3 press attack analyzed

by Bob Warner

Vice President Spiro Agnew's
attack on the press was the
subject of a panel discussion last
Thursday night in the CC
Assembly Hall. The panelists
were: Richard Kendall of the
History Department, Robert
Norton of the Rhetoric and Public
Address Department, William
Rowicy of the English
Department, formerly a reporter
and editor for the Knickerbocker
News, and Donald Decker,
newsman for
Schenectady. The discussion was
moderated by Mrs. Kathy Kendall
of the RPA Department.

The panel sought to draw a
conclusion on the original
question, “Agnew: call to
responsibility or a ﬂirtation with
fascism?" The consensus of the
panel seemed to be that the
Nixon-Agnew Administration is
ﬂirting with fascism.

Norton believes that Agnew's
speech on Nov. 14 that blasted
the news media will be
detrimental to the country in the
long run. He questioned the
necessity to reform the news
media that Agnew has asked for.

Norton also explained why
Nixon picked such a man as
Agnew to run with him. Nixon’s
public relations polls back in early
1968 showed that he would run
best without any running mate.
Therefore, at the Republican

WRGB-TV '“in‘”

Convention, Nixon chose it
“nothing” to run on his ticket,
who would not hurt him in the
elections. Now, that “nothing” is
Vice-President (Mr. Norton cited
as his source AN AMERICAN
MELODRAMA). The President
uses Agnew as a “lightning rod"
for dissent, he said, or as Eugene
McCarthy puts it, “Agnew is
Nixon’s Nixon."

Decker of WRGB explained his
position next. He quoted James
Reston of the NY. Times by
saying that “Agnew has the
courage of Nixon’s convictions."
Mr. Decker is glad that the
Vice-President made the speech if
he sincerely wants the press to be
objective and nothing more. The
electronic media should be
responsible, because “most people
are getting most of their news
from television.” He is not
altogether sure, however, that
Agnew's motives are actually what
Agnew claims them to be. But
Decker does not forsee any
reactionary tide following the
speech in the near future.

Decker thinks that Nixon is
pushing Agnew to make these
comments. One of the dark
incidents in Richard Nixon’s life is
cited by Decker as a reason for his
behavior. In 1962, after Nixon
lost the Gubernatorial race in
California, he made the now
famous remark that the press
“wouldn’t have Nixon to kick
around anymore." He has never

Kuusisto comments on
advisement, housing

by Judy Baldasarri

At Monday's press conference
with students President Kuusisto
commented on several questions
raised inst week. He informed
students that in regard to the
roblem of academic advisement,
Dean Morris of the University
College is willing to meet with any
student or groups of students.

The very pressing problem of
courses being closed out, was
mentioned. Admitting that the
primary responsibility of the
university is to the students, the
President admitted that there
wore, however. several
administrative difficulties. iiesides
the ever present budgetary
problems, the university has 0
way of anticipating a shift n
course interest and popularity
among the student body thereby
causing inadequacies and many
closed sections.

Received from the Ofﬁce of
Management and Planning was the
information that a plan will be
devised and affected over the
Christmas vacation to solve the
problem of commuter versus
resident parking areas. Also raised
at last week's meeting was the
question of the University renting
United Traction Buses to
supplement the University bus
system. President Kuusisto stated
that although the rental cost 01
these buses per year was
enormous it is considerably less
than the cost would be to operate
and maintain University-owned
buses. Therefore the choice is an
economically feasible one.

Various questions concerning
housing were directed to Dr.
Thorne. In regard to on campus
housing contracts. Dr. Thorne

forgiven the press for their attacks
on him.

Rowicy is “against Agnew all
the way." He calls Agnew's call
for responsibility, irresponsible.
Agnew, as Rowicy sees it, is
asking for more than fair news
broadcasting; the Vice-President is
asking the press to spout the
government‘s line on important
issues like Vietnam.

Kendall said that Agnew is
more dangerous than Senator
Joseph McCarthy, because he

actually believes his own “bunk,”
while the late senator did not. The
professor fears that Agnew's
words to the press were threats.
Kendall also feels that Agnew is
flirting with fascism. He said that

this is the 1950‘s all over again,
and pointed out that Pat
Buchanan, who was an, who was
an Anti-New Dealer of the
McCarthy Era, wrote Agnew‘s

Nov. 14 speech. Kendall describes
Nixon and his friends as
“conservative paranoids” who

envision liberals as the uEastern
Establishment people who
subtleiy conspire against
America.”

Kendall also stated that
according to the First
Amendment of the Constitution,
the press must be free, not
neutral. Therefore, the press is
entitled to interpret the news as it
understands it. In contrast,
Decker said that the printed press
should be free, but television must
be impartial, simply because most
people receive news from it.
However, what is considered
impartial is a moot point.

Take the Moratorium Home for

The Vietnam Moratorium
Committee recently sent a special
memo to its more than 3,000
campus organizers urging them to
devote their attention to' this

effort. Students were encouraged
to contact other students‘from
their home towns now on other
campuses.

Spokesmen for the Moratorium
pointed out that many students
will return to their towns again in
January for between semester

initial December activity then.

RPA majors vote
to Implement plan

by Carol Hughes

At a meeting on Thursday,
December 11, the majors of the
Department of Rhetoric and
Public Affairs voted to implement
their resolution of last semester
regarding student participation in
departmental affairs. This plan
calls for equal representation of

students and faculty on
committees determining major
policy decisions for the
department.

The meeting was called to
provide concrete plans for the role
of students in the department, in
accordance with the
recommendations of the Student
Guidelines now being considered

,by University Senate. The majors

regarded their previous decision as
still relevant and sufﬁcient to
meet their needs.

The reason given by the
administration for the non-
enectment of the resolution last
semester was the then unofﬁcial
nature of the University
guidelines.

Students also voted to include
minors and interested students as

the desire of several non-majors to

the departmental meeting held on
Tuesday to discuss the
controversy regarding the
selection of a new department
chairman. This meeting was open
to the department and majors
only, thus denying admission to
several vitally concerned
individuals.

lnforrned sources have told the
ASP that little was accomplished;
the meeting centered upon a
discussion with Dean Perlmutter
over budgetary reasons for the
denial of funds for the hiring of a
