Q:' How does one .go about getting birth control
pills on campus?

A: Well, the ﬁrst place you can try is the
infirmary. If you‘re not married, you’ll probably
have a counselling session and then get referred to
Planned Parenthood or a private physician for
further advice. If you’re a freshman or someone the
staff considers to be somewhat immature, you had
better have some pretty strong reasons for wanting
the pill. Dr. Hood stated that Student Health
Service has found that often young coeds are under
pressure by peer groups or boyfriends, and so the
staff will “work diligently” to let the girl realize the
ramiﬁcations of her proposed request.

In any case, Dr.- Hood said the pill is not
disperfsed on campus because the infirmary staff is
composed mostly of interns and
pediatricians-in-training. Since the pill’s total
harrnlessness has not been proven and follow-up
tests must be given, the Health Service isn’t geared
to the service.

Dr. Hood concluded: “We are very sympathetic
to the idea of contraceptives generally. We try to
help anybody who comes in here to get the help
they are seeking. Also, we are very willing to talk
with groups of students at any time to talk about

,  will attempt to answer students‘ auctions concerning University affairs. Questions,

are having second thoughts), the .professor s
PERSONAL records can consist of anything he
wants. But the mark sent to the Registrar’s officers
strictly Pass-No Credit. In other words, there are no
“secret grades’? available later. .

Q: What exactly is being done about the person
who burned the hut on the Academic Podium?

A:. Dean Chesin said that the whole problem was
referred to the Student Judiciary Committee last
week. A hearing was held in private (in accordance
with standing policy), and the Committee has
forwarded their recommendation of disciplinary
action to the Ofﬁce of Student Affairs. As of Dec.
10, no action had been taken against the person. He
has also refused to make any kind ofa statement on
his motives for burning the hut. Dean Chesin said
that when he apprehended the student, he claimed
he “did it as a Iark."

It should be noted that if the builders ofthe huts
had chosen to bring arson charges against the
student, the Albany Police and courts would have
stepped in and the incident would have been
brought into the open. The group, however, chose
not to press charges.

 

any problems, but particularly problems on
contraceptives or drugs."

One further note: if you’re a married woman
taking the pill and under a doctor‘s care, and ifyou
need some pills to tide you by, the inﬁrmary will
write you a prescription until you can get hold of
your physician.

Q: Under the Pass-No credit system, who
interprets the letter grad—the professor or the
Registrar?

Due to increased costs of printing and increased
circulation. we ﬁnd it necessary to increase our
advertising rates.

Our new rates are as follows:

SA funded groups
organizations-3 l .00/col in.

All other student groups-$1.50/col in.

Local advertising-$2.50/col in.

and non-profit

These rates will be effective as of January I, 1969.

Have you overseen a~small red
golf~cart whizz by you between
Dutch Quad and the Academic
Podium? if you haven’t met its
driver you have. missed meeting-
one of the most. interesting and
good-humored people on this

campus.
He is Dwight Hull, who
conqu e re d the overwhelming

misfortune of his cerebral palsy
condition, and will receive his
degree in January. His previous
history is ﬁlled with trying
experiences worthy of relating to
those of you who haven’t ever
read his small autobiography
‘which he hands you if you talk to

m.

Dwight’s first eight years of
education he received from two
tutors. He then went to a regular
high school and graduated in the
normal four year period in 196].
Next he went to Albany Business
College where he learned
accounting in which he did quite
well. His problem was that his
mother had to do his writing for
him. He quickly realized that if he
continued in this manner he
would never be able to put to
practical use what he had learned.
He stayed home for a year before
he was admitted to SUNY at
Albany.

When Dwight was a junior in
high school he had contacted the
Division of Vocational
Rehabilitation. but they had told
him for three or four years that
his case was too involved to be
helped by them.

Frustrated at himself and
dissatisﬁed with the treatment by
the D.V.R. he typed auletter to

Governor Rockefeller in
December of 1964. Much to
Dwight’s amazement, the
following week he was called on
the phone by a high official at
D.V.R. who made an appointment
with him.

Dwight was sent to Kingston
where for eight weeks he was
evaluated at a workshop. The
evaluation consisted of attempting
many simulated jobs entailing
hand manipulation like putting
.IBM pins in slots, tearing opcn
packages and dumping the
contents into a bin, and sanding
furniture. Next Dwight went to
New York City for a week of
mental testing which finally
resulted in his acceptance at this
university in the September of
1965.

Mr. Hull will graduate in
January with a BS. degree with
his major in Sociology and minor
in English. He is a very ambitious
young man and would like to
prove to himself and others that
he could work at a job and
support himself.

Dwight feels that he would be
most adept in the position ol~
either counselor. supervisor. or
researcher. He wants to use what
he has learned in college and put
it to practical use. Dwight thinks
that some of you might have
parents or relatives who might be

in a position to find such a job. If

anyone knows of any jltll
opportunities which are suited to
Dwight’s abilities please write him
for further information :11.

Peace Corps representatives
conduct campus interviews

by Dave Peck

“The Peace Corps seeks to
assist mankind in the struggle
against the oppressions of disease,
hunger, and lack of education. It
seeks to promote peace through
the improvement of cross-cultural
communication. "

Jack Vaughn
Former Director of the Peace Corps

Peace Corps representatives
were on campus this week
interviewing people and speaking
about the Corps. Bill O’Keefe,
who served in Ethiopia, and
Francis K. Toffa, a citizen of
Togo, were the Peace Corps’
representatives.

O’Keefc, who was a student at
SUNY Buffalo, worked in
Ethiopia for two years. During his
first year he taught English to
elementary school children, the
native language of Ethiopia being
Amharic. In his second year he
worked as an editorial and
administrative assistant in the
Ministry of Agriculture.

Toffa is from the former
French trusteeship of Togo, a
small country in French West
Africa. In Togo he worked with
the Peace Corps for his
government. Peace Corps
Volunteers taught high school
English, helped develop
communities, and constructed
schools in Togo. Toffa feels that
without Peace Corps’ aid Togo
could not have progressed as far as
it has.

There has been a great deal of
controversy in the past few years
about Volunteers expressing their
political views. The official policy
allows them to express themselves
on American politics as long as it
doesn‘t take away from their
effectiveness as Corps lnembcrs.

host country.

The view that the Peace Corps
is actually an arm of the C.l.A.
was discredited by O'Keefe on the
basis that the volunteer works
with the peasants and not with
the government.

Service in the Peace Cor s will
not void a mem cr’s
responsibilities to the draft. Most
draft boards will give a volunteer a
Z-A occupational deferment, but
when they return to the United
States they are once again eligible
for the draft.

Liberal arts majors are needed

to teach, and half of the
volunteers are employed as
teachers. Non—college graduates

are also needed, as machinists,
farmers, carpenters, and
electricians are also in demand.
One fifth of the Corps members
work in rural or urban community
development and another fifth
work in health and agricultural
fields.

President Kennedy created the
Peace Corps by executive order on
March 1, 1961. lit the past eight
years over 40,000 people have
been in the Peace Corps. By the
end of this year there should be
over 10.000 volunteers in 60 host
countries. The average age of a
volunteer is 24.6 years. There are
121 who are older than 50 and
114 under 2|. Sixty-seven percent
are men, and twenty-three percent
are married.

There are five basic
requirements to join the Peace
Corps. You must 1) be a United
States citizen, 2) be at least 18

years, 3) have no dependents
under 18, 4) serve with your
spouseif you’re married, and 5)
never have worked for an
intelligence agency,whéther
military or civilian. The term is
24-27 months, including training.

A volunteer receives an
allowance of $75 a month which
is kept in the United States until
he leaves the Corps. He also
receives a monthly living
allowance ranging from $3660
depending on “adequate” living
costs in the host country.

After leaving the Peace Corps
56.3% of the members are
employed, 37% return to school,
arid 6% become housewives or
enter the military.

The Peace Corps’ presence on
camplls was co-sponsored by the
International Student Association.

larger   - ‘
for student- [senators

by Ken Stokem

At last Thursday’s Central
Council meeting Lenny Kopp and
Jeannette Beckertnan introduced
a proposal that will further
increase the effectiveness of the
student representatives to
University Senate.

This proposal urges University
Senate to open at least one
position on every Senate Council
and Committee to the student
representatives on University
Senate. It was hoped that this
innovation would increase the
students’ knowledge of Senate
activities. The tnotion was passed
17-0-5.

in addition, Council passed a
proposal (20-0-2) that will set
aside its second and fourth
meetings of the spring semester
for the sole purpose of reviewing
and perhaps deciding on the
proposed amended Student
Association Constitution.

This constitution was proposed
last semester by Constitutional
Revisions Committee (CRC) and
was brought up at several Council
meetings last year.

The bill passed last night was
proposed by Ken Stokem,
chairman of Constitutional
Revisions, and introduced by Vic
Looper and Lenny Kopp to
alleviate this situation and
specifically provide these two
sessions of Council to deal
exclusively with the Proposed
Constitution.

It was felt by Stokem that the
important reforms proposed in
the amended constitution must be
decided upon as soon as possible.
These reforms encompass such
things as direct, popular election
of the Student Association
President, the size and
representation of Council and its
Commissions, impeachment and
recall, the judiciary, and the
amending procedure.

If Council acts on the proposed
Amended Constitution at these
meetings, it is conceivable that it

   
 

might be put to referendumtin

time for the MYSKANIA '
elections. ‘ j »
ln , further action, Council

tabled a~ bill introduced by
Jeannette Beckerman on Faculty
Senate Election. .

The bill proposed that eighteen
of the .‘twenty-two student
representatives to University
Se'nate be elected at the same time
as MYSKANIA and class officers.
The other four representatives
were to be elected in the Fall as

soon as deemed possible by
Election Commission.
Certain complications and

inequities were pointed out, that
lead to the tabiing of this bill until '
it could be looked into further.

“Guidelines”

addition noted

The following ofﬁcial action
has been added to STUDENT
GUIDELINES, 1969-70 (Part I V,
Standards of Student Conduct,
6.5):

Disciplinary Removal from
Residence: Removes the
resident student from
universityoperated residence
balls on either a permanent or
temporary basis. This is a more
stringent action, taken in
response to repeated violations
of university residence
regulations. In the event that
this action is for a stated period
of time, the student may apply,
at the end of this period, for
housing in university residence
halls. peciflc regulations in
relatio to residence halls may
also be included. Note: If this
student is under 21 years of age,
the parent or guardian will be
informed ofthis action.
