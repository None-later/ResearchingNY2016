0N FILM

by michael nolin and diana dalley

 

 

A quick look at the theatre ads
tells us that this is another of
those “There is nothing playing at
the movies” weeks. Films in the
Albany area range from “Fanny
Hill” to the twelfth week of
“Easy Rider." Parents complain
there are no family pictures; ﬁlm
buffs that there are no truly
artistic ﬁlms being made today.

Who is to blame? I submit that
although a lot of fault belongs to
the major studios and local
exhibitors, the majority of it must
be squarely placed on the
shoulders of those who are
complaining, the movie-going
public.

In the 30's and 40’s “major
studios ground out over thirty
feamres a year; that number has
dwindled to less than twenty for
the past decade and things look
less than bright for the 70’s. It is
simply not proﬁtable to make
more.

In recent years, family groups
have leveled a great deal of
criticism at the American ﬁlm
industry. Just last month
television station WTEN ran a
ﬁve-minute editorial concerning
the shameful lack of family
pictures. In their statement they
singled out Hellman's Center
theater for playing “The

WTEN on the moral and artistic
values of the ﬁlm (they are
practically nil), I hardly think
putting the blame on theater
management is fair.

When the Center Theater ﬁrst
opened, it publicly announced
itself as “the family theater." For
the ﬁrst two months they played
nothing but “G” and occasionally
“M” rated pictures. At the end of
this riod they were in the red,
yet ‘ he Libertine” made money.
Where were all these loud-'
mouthed people? Perhaps
watching “I, a Woman - Part II” at
some other theater. It seems to
me that if these people were really
concerned about family
entertainment the least they could
do is patronize the General
Audience ﬁlms when they play.

It is the same with intellectuals
and self-made ﬁlm critics. Cinema
Art Theaters used to play the very
best of foreign ﬁlms (i.e. “Knife
in the Water," “Repulsion,”
“Shop on Main Street“); now
theirs are just classy names for sex
houses. Why? It is more proﬁtable
to play sex; today’s movie-goers
would rather see ﬂesh than art.

For example, “Goodbye,:
Columbus” bombed horribly at
Troy’s Cinema Art, yet “I Am
Curious (Yellow)" was sold out

 

libertine.” While I agree with

Have You Heard?

is coming!

Saturday, Feb. 1, 1910

Sponsored by the classes
of 1971 and 1972

for four weeks straight. It is not

 

just bowery bums or the decaying
dregs of society who are attending
CURIOUS and other such ﬁlms,
but a cross-section of .the
film-going public.

Take for example just one
company, Twentieth Century
Fox. Recently they released two
ﬁlms, “The Undefeated" and “A
Walk With Love and Death.” The
former is a “G” rated vehicle in
which John Wayne, as a Union
ofﬁcer, and Rock Hudson, as a
Confederate ofﬁcer, form an
unlikely alliance and friendship. It
is extremely well done, has plenty
of action, and the only hint at sex
is the slightly too long petticoat
of one of the sweet innocent
maidens. “The Undefeated“
played for one almost
audienceless week in Albany.

“A Walk With Love and Death"'
is rated “R”; it makes a deﬁnite
effort to be an artistic success. It
is done with the typical old time
grace and style of its director
John Huston; there are no quick
cuts and numerous dissolves.

There is one sequence which is
simply a masterpiece. The hero, a
wandering poet on his way to sea,
meets a noble woman and asks her
to be his patroness. The girl (who,
by the way, is Huston’s daughter)
has him kneel and says, “Yes, I
will be your lady.“ Giving him her
scarf she continues, “let this be
your token of my patronage."
The hero, rising, answers, “I will
wear it always in your honor."
The ﬁlm then traces their ensuing
romance.

Not too many people have seen
“A Walk With Love and Death"
because not too many theaters
have booked it. In Albany,
nobody has seen it simply because
it is not box ofﬁce—meaning that
the people who have been asking
for this kind of ﬁlm will not see it.

'Brrse"

by Ray Katz

 

 

“Well, we all need someone we
can cream art/and if you want to,
well you can cream on me. "

Nobody argues the genius and

‘ the talent of the Beatles. In pop

music they are the major
innovative force, barring none.
But it is surely not the Beatles
who are to be considered as the
embodiment of rock music. That
is a role left to the Rolling Stones.
Rock is an art form whose main
ingredient, whose main
component, is energy. It is not the
energy supplied by electric
ampliﬁers and sound systems, but
the energy that is fed into these
electronic music makers by the
musicians. And nowhere else can
more raw force, more rock and
roll, be found than on a Stones
release.

The Beatles laid the foundation
for rock music. True. But after a
foundation is put down, someone
has to build something on it, to
make that foundation worthy of
supporting something. And it is
the Stones who are those builders.

"And if you ever catch the
midnight rambler/I'll stick my
knife right down your throat/and
baby, it hurts."

Until just about a year ago
nobody even got felt up in
Beatleland. Oh, sure, teenage girls
ran away at 5 a.m. and Paul
propositioned you to do it in the
road, but did anyone ever even get
a tongue in their mouth? Nope.

“I laid a divorcee in New York
City/I had to put up some kind of
a fight/the lady, she then dressed
me up in roses/she blew my nose
and then she blew my mind. "

Rock had its ﬂing with studio
electronics, Indian influence slept
with l6-track tape machines, and
the offspring produced was studio
rock, capable of being produced
in any recording studio in the
world, but nowhere live and on
stage. Butthen John and Paul, in
all their inﬁnite wisdom, saw fit
to lead all those aimless musicians
back to real music, good old hard
rock and roll (let us all forget
what Peter Townsend said at least
a year and a half before “Lady
Madonna"—and I paraphrase—“I
thing it's time for us to return to
the old days of rock, those crazy
insane days of Chuck Berry and
Elvis Presley”).

So musicians returned to the
basics. The moogs and the mixers
were junked and everyone picked
up their mouth harps, and even
steel guitars, dusted them off and
made some beautiful sounds.

And when it comes right down
to it, down to the basics of raw
hard rock, who plays it like it
should be played? Beatles or
Stones?

"1 said love, aister/it'sjust a kiss
away/it’s just a kiss away. "

The Beatles ramble too much.
In their early years, i.e.,
pre-REVOLVER—they really had
no deﬁnite style. They went from
choir boy sweetness to white
Chuck Berry to poor Everly
Brothers imitations. Yet at the
same time the Stones picked one
style, hard rock, and stuck to it,
developed it and reﬁned it. It was
only when the Stones let
themselves be side-tracked into
studio antics on SATANIC
MAJESTIES, which is still a
wonderful album, that they lost
ground to the Beatle boys. Yet if
you really want to see classic
development of a rock group’s
work, starting with their “most
significant” album, through their
latest work—i.e., the development
of a particular style and its
reﬁnement—the Stones are a
marvelous, and the best, example
around.

If REVOLVER was when the
Beatles came of age, then its
cousin in the realm of the Stones
was AFTERMATH. It was here
that the Stones were able to do
diverse types of things and yet tie
it all together so neatly and ever
so tightly. There was their tour de
force, “Paint it Biack;” their ﬂing
with country on “High and Dry;”
the ballad of “Lady Jane;" the
pure rock and roll 'of “It's Not
Easy;” and “Think,” and the
bluesy symphony of
munch—“Going Home."

Now trace this through to
BEGGARS‘ BANQUET:
“Sympathy for the Devil;" the
country of “Dear Doctor;” “No
Expectations,” the ballad; the
rock of “Street Fighting Man;”
and the bluesy sex of “Stray Cat
Blues."

These similarities are more
obvious on LET IT BLEED;just
match them up. There’s “Gimme
Shelter;" :1 countrified “Honky
Tonk Woman" called “Country
I‘Ionk‘," “Love in Vain" is the
ballad; “Live With Me” and
“Monkey Man" are two examples
of the pure-bred rock and roll the
Stones excell at; and there‘s
“Midnight Rambler," their hymn
to a rapist, that matches “Going
Home."

Three albums. All three leading
to the others. All three lending to
the others. This is musical
development.

“I got nasty habits/I take tea at
three.../my best friend. he shoots
water rats/and feeds them to his
geese/don’t you think there's a
place for you/in between the
sheets.../Come on now honey
don't you want to live with me."

I like what the Stones do, I like
what they say. And most of all, I
like how they say it. They are the
epitome of a group that‘s
together. Each man picks at his
instrument. never confusing things
with needless solos or extra notes
jammed in. The music is beautiful.
Jagger's singing, which is a musical
instrument in itself, is great.
Together, he and Keith Richard
com rise a songwriting team as
goo as any other, including
Lennon and McCartney.

lt's ﬁve individuals producing
one collective voice, a voice that is
probably the most signiﬁcant, and
even the best in rock and roll
today.

Stare Hartwick,

 

by Jay Marshall

In a complete reversal of form,
the Albany State basketball team
edged a tough Marist squad 66-64
last Thursday night. The margin
of victory was provided by center
Steve Sheehan’s ﬁeld goal with
two seconds remaining in the
game.

From the opening tap-off, it
was evident to all those present
that this was not the same Albany
team which was easily defeated by
Plattsburgh last Tuesday. Marist,
which scored over 100 points in
its previous outing, was stymied
by a tight, aggressive defense.
Albany’s hustling play all over the
court more than made up for
Marist‘s edge in rebounding.
Junior forward Allan Reid led the
Danes in rebounding with twelve
and chipped in with eleven points.
Guards Jack Adams and Jim
Masterson effectively pressured
Marist, causing many turnovers.

Offensively, Albany was led by
forward Jack Jordan’s twenty-five
points. Scoring on shots from all
over the court. Jordan’s point
total equaled his perfonnancc in
the season’s opener at Williams.
As a team Albany shot 40 per
cent from the floor, quite in
improvement over the team‘s
shooting against Plattsburgh and
Stony Brook.

The hero of the game for State
was the center, Sheehan. With the
score tied and less than two
minutes left in the game, Albany
decided to play for the last shot.
With seven seconds left, Shechun
shot and missed from the corner
but grabbed his own rebound and
put in the game-winning basket.
The junior transfer from Hudson
Valley C.C. scored eleven points
while battling the taller Marist
players under the boards.

lncvitably, racial intolerance, which has been nurtured in our nation
for many years, has found its way to the university, and in one major
instance, to the athletic ﬁeld.

Ever since the black man has begun to compete ﬁrst on the
intercollegiate level and then in the varsity arena, he has been made to
feel that society is doing him a favor by letting him play ball. He has
been met with an attitude which says that sport has “made” him, so
to speak, and hence, he should do as he is told and nothing more. This
treatment no longer applies.

The primary point is that at this juncture in our history, we are
faced with rioting in our streets and violence on our campuses, all of
which has been precipitated by our ancestors, through a lack of
understanding and intolerance and which we, as yet, have been unable
to alleviate.

One basic concept which we must accept is that the black man is an
individual with a certain degree of pride and that in nottreating him as
such, this pride is directed into an extremely volatile defensive
attitude which strikes out at remarks or actions which ordinarily
might not warrant such aggressive response.

College coaches throughout the nation have begun to relize this.
They have asked the players to level with them, to tell them exactly
how they feel so that the coach may pattern his thinking and actions
in a more constructive manner. John Pout, head football coach at
University of Indiana where blacks were suspended from the varsity
squad for missing two practice sessions expresses himself this way: “I
haven’t changed my mind really, on anything that has transpired.
We've asked, ‘Why do you feel this way?” and ‘What is it a black feels
about being black?‘ trying to get to their ideas. We’ll never know but
at least they can explain to us how they feel." _

In some cases, the blacks have explained their feelings and it would
take a fool to say that they are not justiﬁed. The blackman is
primarily concerned with getting an education. When he receives a
scholarship for a “ﬁve year plan" and then has it taken away when his
four years of uthclctic eligibility expires, he must use his own funds to
graduate. Many times, the money just isn‘t there. Then a black is told
to shave his board or quit the team, he is the object of an archaic
"all-amcrican utheletc" theory which would hch gone out with spats.
And when it is publicized that blacks have demanded more playing
time, it is quite possible that whites have done the same but we have
not heard as much about it.

In short, unrest ln sport is the same as unrest anywhere. It is
characterized by a lack of communication which leads to
misunderstanding and bad feeling. Coaches have begun to bridge this
