“The War Prayer."

“0 Lord our Father, our-young
patriots, idols of our hearts, go
forth to battle — be Thou near
them!

With them, in spirit, we also go
forth from the sect peace of our
beloved ﬁresides to smite the foe.

O Lord our God, help us to tear
their soldiers to bloody shreds
with our shells; help us to cover
their smiling ﬁelds with the pale
forms of their patriot dead; help
us to drown the thunder of the
guns with the shrieks of their
wounded, writhing in pain; help
us to lay waste' their humble

help us, to wring the hearts of
their unoffending widows with
unavailing grief; help us to turn
them our roofless with their little
children to wander unfriended the
wastes of their desolated land in
rags and hunger and thirst, sports

the icy winds of winter, broken in ‘

spirit, worn with travail irnploring
Thee. for the refuge of the grave

visitations II

by Perry Silvennan

 

 

Ed. Note:/ Both this column and
'Visitations I' were unsolicited
contributions brought to us by
the authors. We will continue to
allott column space next term to
anyone who wishes to expound
on one particular viewpoint.

One of the most amazing
qualities of Vice President Agnew
is his faulty sense of history and
politics. He has been particularly
adept in displaying his lack of
historical and political knowled e
in speeches on dissent and t e
press.

A ew has consistently alluded
to the: historical situation during
World War II to support his
demands for a unified nation to
aid the war effort. He also
maintains that the American
political system can disenfranchise
part of the society which supports
it and continue functioning.

The Vice President recalls when
Americans fought for their
country in Europe and the Paciﬁc
against the Axis powers and now
wonders why young Americans
refuse to do combat for their
nation's honor today. Mr. Agnew
seems to forget that the United

SlBWS fought in self-defense
during World War II. In Vietnam,
this country intervened in an
internal dispute between two
nationalistic forces to assist an
essentially illegal government
(read the 1954 Geneva treaty if
you don't believe it). American
national security was hardly at
stake as it was in the struggle
against the Axis.

Agnew also stated about
dissenters that “we can afford to
separate them from our society
with no more regret than we
should feel over discarding rotten
apples from a barrel." He has
given no explanation concerning
the methods of this separation.
However, his fascination'with the
World War II period brings to
mind the way in which dissenters
from the political developments In
Germany in the 1930's were
“as stated" from their society.

ven if this was not the case,
due to the moralistic ethic that
Americans attribute to
themselves, does Mr. Agnew
actually think that the national
government -can disenfranchise
part of society from the American

political system without
endangering its operation?
Political science theory, supported
by historical fact, shows that
when a government does not
respond positively to inputs from
the society, it loses legitimacy in
the view of the society. This loss
of legitimacy leads to demands for
an alteration of the political
system. The manner in which such
an alteration would take place
depands upon the ﬂexibility of
that existing governmental process
in responding to this crisis
situation. In the 1700‘s, American
demands for an alteration of the
British system so that the colonies
would be represented with full
powers in Parliament were
suppressed. The American
Revolution was the ultimate
result.

In regard to Agncw's attitude
toward the press, he stated that
“when Winston Churchill rallied
public opinion to stay the course
against Hitler's Germany, he
didn't have to contend with a
gaggle of commentators raising
doubts about whether he was
reading the' public right."

Historically, this is false. Churchil
had many journalists and

politicians who 0 posed him.

However, it should e noted that

it was Hitler who did not have to

contend with journalistic

opposition when rallying his

nation against Britain.

Politically, this criticism of

news analysis strikes at one of the
bases of a democratically oriented
society-knowledge. This includes
the knowledge to refuse false
information. Mr. Agnew's
lnsinuation that only one side of
the coin should be examined—his
side (which he equates with the
correct side)v-disposes of the
principle of weighing differing
views. Disposing of this principle
also disposes of the way in which
members of a democratic society
determine their own views on
public issues critically.

Vice President Agnew's
apparent View that ignorance of
the opposite side of an Issue is
strength. in addition to his
afﬁnity toward dlsenfranehlslng
dlssent, has indicated that he is in
need of a refresher course on the
principles of democracy.

.m. at Bus. Administration 209.
Protest the draft, anyone?

An underground reporter
recently _ interviewed a Nixon
spokesman about the way. The
man rapped about the ﬁghting
IuIl', “...you’ll agree that 100 GI
deaths per week is a bargain...“ He
continues, “The Administration
has three problems: one, claiming
enough enemy dead to satisfy the
hawks, two, getting enough Gl‘s
knocked off to make the number
of claimed enemy dead seem
plausible, and three, keeping GI
deaths at a level that won‘t
outrage the doves.” “Of course, if
enough Gl’s get the notion that
dying to fill a quota is not as
noble as dying for one’s country,
some downward adjustment may
become desireable...” He
concluses, “These are the realities
of the Vietnam war, my boy. Isn‘t
it better to sacriﬁce one hundred
men rather than a thousand, or,
worse yet, admit we were wrong
to sacriﬁce any of our boys in the
ﬁrst place?"

Also out of Washington is a
report that Nixon was caught
making “an obvious two-handed
automobile driving gesture" after
shaking hands with Ted Kennedy
at Andrews Air Force Base. On
New York cities WOR radio
station, John Wingate had a guest
who was answering word
associations. Wingate publicly
apologized when the response to
‘ Nixon" was “homosexual
without a sense of humor." One
other interesting news report this
month was about the publisher of
Reader‘s Digest. His seventeen
year old son, upon reading an
article his dad wrote about the
family's generation gap, plunged a
knife into his father's stomach.
Generation gap?

Meanwhile, back on campus,
it's time for re-hiring and tenure
decision. Any student who feels
that a particular faculty member
is being either unjustly denied or
unjustly granted tenure or a new
contract, should organize his class
or circulate a petition. The time
to exert our power ls NOW!

There was another Central
Council Poll taken, this time
about the University Public Order
Maintenance plans. Why did the
enormous turnout of 213 answers
occur? Obviously, there was no
choice for total abolition of the
repressive rules.

Liberated Propaganda—350!
To the Editors:

During the past three weeks, the members of one
of three groups in RPA 350 --0ral Propaganda ~-
have conducted an extensive campaign designed to
bring attention to the Women’s Liberation Front.
At the time this project was conceived - wholely by
the members of the group, with absolutely no
advice or decision of approval or disapproval by the
instructor - the Women’s Liberation Front was a
totally unknown, wholely unorganized, virtually
non-existent group.

Within the three weeks since Thanksgiving
vacation, as we are sure almost every student at
Albany State will agree, the WLF, like Spiro Agnew,
has become a household word. They have gained
notoriety solely through the efforts of our group,
although recently they have contributed somewhat
by their conspicuously emotional reaction to our
campaign. ‘

Las week, after our initial efforts became known
to the WLF, all hell broke loose, to put it lightly.
This was precisely what we had expected and
anticipated. For the most part the WLF reacted
adversely to the slogans and posters we had
distributed and put up on campus .... .. .

THE WLF has expressed some rather strong
disapproval of our freely given public relations
advice and advertising, and frankly, our feelings are
hurt. But, gosh, when an organization elects a
steering committee one week, and by the following
week have forgotten who they elected, well, “Gee
Whillikers!” somebody has to do something!!!

One thing is for sure; the stereotype of the irate
woman -- the epitome of the female temper -- is
embodied in the WLF. Maybe we just caught them
at a bad time of the month, but it seems as if “being
emotional" is a “role” that even the members of the
Women’s Liberation Front are still accepting.

Seriously yours,
THE GROUP

Inundation!

To the Editors: ‘

During the past few weeks the campus has been
innundated with propaganda and publicity
concerning the women's liberation movement. The
propaganda which announces the meetings of the
Women’s Liberation Front has various slogan’s
pasted on the top; “Pussy Power" and suggestions
that members of the Women‘s the Women‘s
Liberation Front don‘t wear bras, etc. At this point
the Women’s Liberation Movement emphatically
disassociates itself from all such publicity and
condemns it as reactionary and male chauvinist..

There is a history to these leaﬂets. They emanate
from a course given in the speech department called
“Oral Propaganda" taught by Robert Norton. The
students in the course were given the assignment to
break down into groups and create, by agitational
means, an issue on the campus. One of these groups,
led by Kenneth Stringer and Robert Iscman, known
reactionaries, undertook to secretly publicize the
Women‘s Liberation meetings under the slogans

mentioned above. They never approached the
women‘s group about their intentions to do
publicity, and in fact their own intentions were
explicitly hostile to the movement. Under the guise
of Norton’s protective security in terms of the
assignment, they began disseminating their garbage.

What makes them so uptight? When questioned.
Kenneth Stringer claimed that his goal was to
destroy the Women‘s Liberation organization.
Fortunately most women are beginning to recognize
that the kind of subserviantworld that the Stringers
would place women into is precisely the kind of
world that the women’s movement is successfully
challenging.

Under the guise of Pussy Power, Stringer is
articuating a very old notion created by Western
civilization and rampant in most men, that is, that
heterosexuality is necessary in bed, but outside the
bedroom all other concepts of meaning, activity,
and power are homosexual. The culturally created
homosexual world objectifics women, i.e., makes
them into alienated bodies and gives them no life
except within the confines of what the man
demands. Women‘s Liberation has nothing against
honest homosexuality, but when homosexual
concepts crce Into heterosexual relationships under
the guise of ominution we can only say that these
concepts have become our enemies.

Women's liberation milltntcs against all notions of
homosexual domination and is seriously involved, in
creating defnitions of human equal relationships. l‘o
tear down the walls of dominance and to create
self-determined relationships places the Stringcrs oi
the world In the camp of uptight reactionary man.
All we can say to them is “Up against the wall

mother fucker." (Freud would have said that’s
where their aproblems were rooted in the ﬁrst place.)
We have re business to take care of. Go solve your
own homosexual fetishes on you own. Don’t use us
for your own repressed fantasies. The real and only
question is true unfetishized liberation.

Liz Ewen, member
Women's Liberation Front .

Phantastic!

Dear Sirs,

I was delighted to read (ASP, Tuesday, December
9th) about the phantastically democratic method
that is used to select the Editor of your organ, and
the new, radical approach in actually allowing the
consideration, by the incumbent Editorial Board, of
applications for the post of Editor from carefully
screened persons who are not actually already
members of the ASP movement (subject, of course,
to the formality of the candidate giving the right
answers when questioned about his ideas).

Where, one can but wonder, will all this new
liberality end? Perhaps even someday the students
who ﬁnance the paper, via the SA Tax, may actually
themselves get a vote in who controls it. Or perhaps
Editorial Boards will choose to continue rehearsing
potential roles for the future; after all, who knows,
one day they may perhaps ﬁnd themselves members
of some political machine or other, or even, dare
one say it, a Faculty member of some university?

Yours etc.
John D. Kennedy

Highly Unproductive

To the Editors:

Yesterday‘s Senate meeting was highly
unproductive. A number of people obstructed the
conduct of business in order to raise questions and
present motions which are better answered at times
other than the times they were raised.

The topics of Viet Nam, the Viet Nam War, and
US. involvement are important topics. They need
great consideration, but they need consideration by
ALL MEMBERS of the University.

As all Senators may well recognize, the vote to
adjourn effectively blocked ALL DISCUSSION on
ALL MATTERS. This certainly is detrimental.

Math Instruction ‘Slammed’

Open Letter to the Mathematics Department:

If the instructors and students of the math
department want an efﬁcient way to correct present
discrepancies, they should agree to have a “slam
session" as the Biology department now has. A
“slam session" is a meeting of students and
professors for the purpose of voicing their opinions
about department policies. The outcome of these
meetings is not only to understand problems, but to
take suitable action to rectify them. However, to
have such a session, ALL students and professors
must be willing to attend.

Sincerely yours,
Barry Kolman and
Norman Wcrdiger

Danes Defended

To the Editors:

At ﬁrst I seriously considered writing to the ASP
to make a reply concerning Raymond Naidl's letter
which suggested changing the name of our
basketball learn from the “Great Danes" to the
“Albany Clowns."

But after my initial anger died down, I realized
that the majority of people on campus would realize
Mr. Naidl's general stupidity. Of course, we all
already know that the slate forbids athletic
scholarships at state schools. Of course, we all know
neither Rich Margison or Scott Price was on any
sort of scholarship. Of course, we all know we have
a schedule heavily-laden with non-scholarship
schools. Of course, we all know that scholarships at
Albany are given for ﬁnancial need, and ﬁnancial
need only. And of course we all know that after last
years impressive tourmuucnt performance we
already have more than a “respectable” reputation
throughout the East. But let us not dwell on Mr.
Naidl's luck of gray matter.

Instead, I would like to thank the fans who have
continued to support the Snuersman. It was a
heartwarming feeling to look up in the stands before
the Marist game and see the p ace packed. It Is not
too many schools where 2,500 students will come
to support in team on a weekday night after two

disastrous defeats.

I suppose you fans can take partial credit for our
victory over Marist.

Theyswere a ton team; probably the best we
have played. Yet bany rose to the occasion and
the constant roar of the fans helped to keep them at
the peak of their performance. .

No doubt there will be other nights when we are
having trouble ﬁnding the basket. But the Danes
wdl not stay down for long with fans like you
behind them.

As for Mr. Naidl, I suggest you write the New
York Times and demand they change the name of
the New York Knicks to the New York Clowns.
They lost twice in a row too!

Reactionary Holdout

To the Editor:

During the limited amount of time that I've spent
on this campus, I have witnessed a tremendous
liberalization of administrative policies and views.

The changes that have been made and those that
are now being considered were inevitable. The
students of today differ drastically both inwardly
and outwardly from the students of past
generations. It is these differences that have brought
about the recent Iiberalizations. Just as society
undergoes change, so must the “society” of the
university.

There exists on this campus, however, one small
section that has resisted changes in its policies over
the past years and has therefore remained stagnant
in its way of thinking.

During the past few months I have had the
pleasure of being the receptionist at the Student
Inﬁrmary during visiting hours. Recently I was

dismissed for refusing to cut my hair which my
employer felt was too long and therefore was
inhibiting the successful completion of my duties.
This was not the only restriction that was placed on
my appearance. I was also informed that I was not
to wear beads and that I was to always come to
work dressed in a shirt and ties.

I feel that the restrictions placed on me were
entirely unfair and unreasonable. My duties at the
Inﬁrmary were to let the appropriate number of
visitors in and to make sure they had left at the
close of'visiting hours. In no way did my appearance
either help or hinder me in performing these duties.

I therefore feel that a change should be made to
thoroughly revise the existing policies governing the
dress and appearanCe of student employees at the
Inﬁrmary or any other place that hires students on
campus.

When I questioned the fact that my hair did not
determine my performance on the job nor was it
offensive to the visitors, patients, or nurses, I was
told that my job was not to question existing
policies but rather only to complete (as the Director
pkaurses, Marjorie Frame put it) my “menial
as s.

I felt it was my right to question the existing
policies if I felt they were wrong. I think it is about
time that the administration and the director of the
Inﬁrmary, Dr. Hood, look over the policies used to
hire student employees at the Inﬁrmary. These
policies should be revised.

| feel it is about time people started tearing down
the barriers between a person‘s appearance and the
person himself. Let us once and for all open our
minds and begin judging a person's performance on
his performance alone and not on his appearance.

Regretfully yours,
Andy Egol

Conscience .and ‘Pigs’

To the Editor:

I would heartily agree with Mr. DoPree‘s stand
("An Approach to Song My," ASP, Dec. 9): “As
long as service men are unable to differentiate
‘friend' from ‘enemy‘, especially when ‘they all look
the sume’, how is one to expect a decline in civilian
(‘gook') murders?" He's right. chasoment of
individuals to “things, not humans" 'Ia imperative
before one can justify violence. Luckily, we as
university students are too wise to be guilty of the
crime; wc'll leave that to the pigs.
