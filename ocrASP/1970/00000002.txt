Computerized Data Bank
to be put into operation

WASIIINGTON~~(CI’S)--The
US. Army will soon put in opera—
tion a computerized data bank
that will bc capable of providing
the FBI. CIA, Secret Service and
Army, Navy and Air Force com-
mands across the US. with in-
stantaneous information on past
and prcscnt civilian political
activity of all kinds. from antiwar
spccchcs to campus demonstra-
lions.

According to Christopher H.
l’ylc. a former captain in Army
lnlclligcncc who wrote an article
in thc ll’uslringloli [lion/lily. the
curricula of the data bank will be
Lakcn from FBI and state and

Pylc said thc team of investi-
gators has I)I‘(‘ll maintaincd by the
Army since 1965. They were
brought into bcing to provide
curly warning of ciilil disorders in
which the Army might bc askcd

dents. The investigators' reports
are distributed via a nationwide
teletypc system.

Today. Pyle said. the Army
kccps files on the membership,
ideology. programs and practices
of almost every political group in
the country. including radical or-
ganizations like the Revolutionary
Action Movement (RAM) and
nonviolent ones like the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference.
ACLU and NAACP. Utilizing the
files. the Army periodically pub-
lishes n “blacklist” of people and
organizations who. in the opinion
of Intelligence Command officials,
might causrI trouble for the Army.

Sonic of the information will be
gathcrcd by civilian spics. l’ylv

Robert Rienow, above; Alfred Hulstrunk, lower left; and Donald McNauglu. lower right. addressed the

ligencc Agency.

Pyle said one reason for keeping
track of civilian political activity.
specified in counter—insurgency
manuals. is to facilitate the arrest
of counter-insurgents and guer-
rillas. He said
soldiers and civilian cmployes of
the Army with forcign-born
spouses arc currently barred from
jobs rcquiring ability of Army
intelligence to use its information
intelligently.

In light of rcvclations about the
CIA‘s financing of student groups.
labor unions and foundations, and
illegal wiretapping by thc FBI and
Internal Revenue Service, Pylc
said. there is reason to bclicvc the

PYE organizes,

aimed at action

by Bob Holmes

“Environment is suddenly a big
issue. Politicians, bureaucrats, and
businessmen are leaping to record
themselves in favor of a cleaner
environment. But the record of
achievement is rather bleak. We
have had too much rhetoric and
too little understanding of eco-
logical problems--while the crisis
becomes steadily worse." The pre—
ceding was a selection from the
various literature obtained at the
second meeting of PYE (Protect
Your Environment) Club. About
350 people crowded into LC 23 to
hear lectures and help to further
organize the PYE Club.

Why does PYE exist? What does
it intend to do? Here is what it
says in the club constitution
passed out at this meeting.

The purpose of the PYE club
shall be:

A. To afford the opportunity
for club members to become edu-
catcd and act on problems of the
environment on local, state and
national levels.

B. To inform the public of the
serious environmental problems
and what to do about them.

C. To communicate with, and
educate government officials as to
present environmental problems.
and what to do about them.

D. To propose immediate action
and enforceable legislation to pro-
tcct the environment.

In general. PYE is calling for
awareness. understanding, and
action on these problems. Action
is a key word--thcy do not intend
to be an armchair group. This was
one of the points expressed in the
lectures by Professors Hulstrunk.
Ricnow, and McNaught. Their lec-
tures were informative and also
rather frightening.

Prof. Ricnow referred to the
struggle against pollution as
nothing short of an “issue of
survival."

“We have been at war too long
with our environment" and he
called on our generation. one
which despises war, to help put an
end to this one. He rcalizcs you
cannot allcviatc any of Ihcsc proh-
Icms. they will rcquiri- a long term
effort, but Iiicnow continued,
“This gcncration can do any-
thing!"

I do not know whether or not
we can do anything, but we are
compelled to do something. Prof.
Hulstrunk predicted, with great
conjecture. mass deaths within ten
years, numbering around 10.000,
due to pollution.

, The files are maintained at
the Investigative Records Reposi-
tory at Ft. Holabird in Baltimore,
where the computerized data
bank will be installed. According
to Pyle. material fed into the
computer will fall into two gen-
eral categories: “incident reports”
concerning bombing. disorders
and demonstrations, and “person-
ality reports" concerning the law-
ful and unlawful political activity
of civilians.

What can you do? Join PYE.
There will be an Environmental
Teach-In on April 22. This is
nation-wide and a big step in the
fight to save the world. If you
want to help call Helen Ghiradella
at 457-2788. The PYE club has its
office in Fine Arts 218, 457-3913.
