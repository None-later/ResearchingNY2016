Richie-Havens Climaxes ‘Son of a Weekend’

  

by Alan Lasker

Chanting soul type blues,
singer, guitarist Richie Havens, a
high flying, cool Brooklyn boy
laid it on "heavy" to the students
of Albany State last Saturday
evening. His whole performance
proved that nothing succeeds like
relating and communicating to tiie
people around him.

Richie Havens greeted the Mid
ience with a rap on the dubious

benefits of the air travel class
system. Following this came
selections that exhibited his fan-
tastic control of the guitar. llis

accompanying combo supported
him most suCCcssfuily with an
outstanding performance by Joe
Price on the bongos and the con-
ga. The selections commenced
with harmonious introductions.
The beats were heavy, the notes
exploding and the arrangemean

superb.
One of Mr. Havens riips dealt
with a social comment on the

word "peace." “To me a peace is
first, an iiidividuiil thing. it is
something We have when we are
alone. This is when we have our
best ideiis, when we feel the best,
when we talk ourselves into
things." With this statement in
mind, he talked of love...“thn
we re alone we talk . '

tion. When asked if he like to use
other performers songs, Mr.
Havens replied, "I am sharing the
same song, not using it."

Mr. llaVcns always had a little
something up his sleeve or over his
shoulder to add and then some...
and zap-his guitar strings burst
and a rap followed as he repaired
them.

The concert concluded with
4000 students digging Richie
lIaVens as he \vailed “Freedom.”
This wasn't enough for flll‘

audience. A three minute standing
ovation brought him back.

When asked from where his in»
spiration and strength eminated
for such a successful performance,
Mr. Havens replied. “The audience
gets into me and my feelings come
from within...my strength comes
from up tiiere." Hc merely point—
ed to the heiIVens.

Richie Havens talked of the
unity principal. “We are all one,
we were always one and we will
always be one. it is too bad that it
can only be seen in a war or at a
concert."

Richie Havens is an individual
with a mind as well as talent in
the music profession. llis dancing,
wailing. and rapping combined in
creating a most fantastic evening.

 

into or out of love. Is this really
Love?"

The atmosphere was inte nsc.
The penetrating beat held a
capacity audience captive. A

vibrant performer who enjoyed
his work to the extent that his
intermission was but for two
minutes, excited the crowd into a
handclapping, footstompiiig fer-
vor.

His improvisation of "Strnwv
berry Fields" iind "Just Like A
Woman" created a hvunotic sensa-

The posters proclaimed that
“On Feb. 6,7,&8, things are gonna
loosen up.” Wild, wild weekend
number twa was upon us, though
perhaps the main fault with the
weekend was that things were too
loose. The events were meant to
supply something for everyone, or
at least to supply something for
nearly everyone. But what
actually happened was that a ser-
ies of events comparable to those
held on any normal weekend were
grouped together under the title
of "son of a weekend."

This is not to say, however, that
this event was a complete fail-
ure,nor that it was not worth-
while. It provided exactly what
was needed for a first weekend
back at school; namely, oppor-
tunities for meeting new people,
and events to enjoy with old
friends.

Friday night allowed people to
mix and match up at a mixer
featuring “Mammoth” and spoir
sored by TXO in the Campus
Center ballroom. For those who
were already paired up, or who
just wanted to relax with good
company and better entertain-
ment, at Guitar Cup, the mood
was soft and the lights were low
over at the Dutch Quad flagroom.
The informal atmosphere lent
much to the evening, and every-
one was invited to pull up a niece

of the rug and enjoy themselves.
Larry Brown proved to be an able
Master of Ceremonies, as well as a
more than able performer, and
was supported by the talents of
Brendon Montano, Hector Rivera,
Allison Carr, Rich Larris, Kaye
Kraft, Ellie Kelly, Andy Avery,
and Frank Harding.

Meanwhile, back at the ranch,
the Lone Ranger, Tonto, an
Hopalong Cassidy were riding the
range over in Lecture Room 7.
The film series was repeated at
7:30 iind 10:00 on both nights,
and fans of the Masked Man and
floppy, trivia experts, and those
who were still children at heart
(which was practically the entire
audience) were able to “return
with us now to those thrilling
(lays of yesteryear."

[be Saturday night activities
were scheduled around the princi-
pal event of the weekend, the
Richie Havens concert. Two
mixers were held after the con-
cert, one on Colonial Quad and
one on Dutch Quad, for all those
who wanted to keep in the mood
set by the concert and (lance for
most of the night. A pizza and
beer party was held in the Campus
Center Cafeteria for those who
wanted a snack after the concert,
and a band was there to provide

music as well. All of these events
were well attended.

A few things could have been
improved, however. The idea of
mixers after the concert was a
good one, but the flag rooms were
too small and too far apart for
this purpose. It might have been
better to have both quads
co-sponsor one large mixer in ii
central location. The pizza party
achieved success, but I noticed
about the same amount of people
in the Snack Bar at the same time.
In fact, several couples were
taking their pizza and beer into
the snack bar area where they said
there was “more atmosphere."
And although I enjoyed Guitar
Cup circuit at Dutch, I feel that a
bit more planning could have been
done as far as the program was
concerned in order to prevent the
repetition of the same songs by
several performers.

But aside from the few techni-
ailities, the weekend was a suc-
cess, and a great deal of credit
should be extended to all those
who helped to make it possible,
including Comm. Programming
Commission, Colonial, Dutch and
State Quads, IFC-ISC, the Music
Dept., Sopli.-Jr. Classes and TXO.

‘A rrangement’s
Mars Film Version of Nave

by Tom Quigley
Never having read Elia Kazan‘s I
novel “The Arrangement" it

would appear , at least in his
motion picture version, that it was
one long, confusing rap about ego
involvement and the pleasures of
extra-marital excess. The film
places Kazan in the position of
the artist in total control of his
creation and its adaption from
one media to another. Yet Ka-
zan‘s psychological exploration of
Eddie Anderson '5 middle aged dis-
illusionment new" 39" beyong
the examination of his rampant
libido.

Kazan is one of the few Ameri-
can film directors with the ability
to create artistically within the
framework of the commercial film
industry. THE ARRANGEMENT
however illustrates one of Kazan‘s
most prominent flaws as seen in
most of his recent films. He con-
denses too much material from
the novel and crowds it into nu-
merous disjointed episodes. There
is suci. a fantastic amount of

Music Ensemble Performs Old

Masterpieces with New

by Warren Burt

On Friday night, the Con-
temporary Chamber Ensemble of
New York City, led by conductor
Arthur Weisberg, presented a per-
formance before a full house in
the main theatre of the Per-
forming Arts Center that can only
be described as phenomenal.

The program presented by the
group, which was sponsored by
the Music Council, consisted of
two of the works of the early
20th century which did so much
to bring about the dominant form
of this era, that is, the composi'
tion for mixed chamber ensemble.
The two works' ,surprisingly con-
sidered "contemporary" by many
people, despite their advanced age
(53 and 57 years respectively),
were Stravinsky’s L'Hisloire du
Soldat, andd Schoenberg‘s Pierrot
Lunaire. The Stravinsky was writ-
ten in 1917 as the musical part of
a play-ballet collaborated on by
Stravinsky, Ramuz, and Anser-
met, and the suite extracted from
the work bv the

sists of 11 selections from that
music arranged in roughly chrono—
logical order to musically convey
the plot. The real importance in
this work however, is not in the
breezy melodies, the clatter of the
bi-tonal marches, or the incredible
wit that crackes from almost
every phrase, but in the media
with which the composer sought
to represent his musical thought.
With the small group of instru-
ments at his disposal, Stravinsky
created a musical texture that is at
once full and yet intimate. Even
such movements as the Tango
with its violin and percussion
duet, sound almost symphonic in
nature.

By using a minimum of means
for a maximum of effect, Stravin-
sky contributed much to the 20th
century chamber tradition. The
performance of this work was
absolutely flawless but if special
credit should be given to anyone,
I feel that the liiurels should go to
violinist Jeanne Benjamin and
trumpeter Robert Nagel for'their

unees of their incredibly difficult

parts.

And while we're on the subject
of difficult music, lets turn to
Pierrot Lunaire, Schoenberg‘s
song cycle of 21 Albert Giraud
poems set for Sprechstimme
voice, (a hybrid of speech and
song) piano, cello, clarinetist,
flutist, and violinist (each of the
last 3 alternate between two in-
struments).

That this piece is difficult muSIc
is true. It remain< today, and
perhaps will always be, difficult to
play, analyze, and listen to. And
yet the difficulties are not insur-
mountable, and for this extremely
emotional, incredibly complex
piece, are most certaian worth it.

This masterpiece is important
on many different levels, of which
the harmonic, orchestrations] and
psychological are prime. However,
I would now like to concentrate
on another level--the virtuosic.
Although all the parts of this
piece are absolutely fiendish in
difficulty, the piano and voice
parts take the prize as being per-
haps the most difficult musics
ever written for their respective
media. Mezzo-Soprano Jan de-
Gaetani, and pianist Gilbert Kalish
were, however, more than equal

to the task. Miss deGaetani’s per-
formance was just this side of
unbelieveablenshe whispered, she
shricked, she sang, she exploited
almost every possibility of her
amazing voice to convey perfectly
both the spirit and letter of these
fantastic poems. Likewise for
pianist Kalish. His speed, ac-
curacy, and feeling for this music
of hair-raising difficulty is quite
beyond compare.

:bibliographical data presented
about Anderson's life that the
lepisodic treatment becomes an
‘indigestible jumble that lose:
track of time sequence and fre-
quently confuses even the moat
attentive viewer.

No sooner has Kazan established
one scene, when he immediately
ﬂashes forward or cuts to some-
‘thing vaguely related with Eddie’s
past or present life. The culmina-
tion of all this leaping backward
and forward is a disconcerting
.patchwark of celluloid. Kazan
doesn't seem to understand the
purposes of his own creation. It is
puzzling as to whether we are
witnessing a sincere, massive satire
on the American dream or the
unconscious awakening of a busi-
nessman satyr.

What Kazan seems to be saying
is that every chance Eddie had to
become a sensitive, dynamic
writer and man were squelched by
the forces of greed and guilt

L “' " in the r of his
strong willed Greek father. Com-
pound these youthful fears with
the oppression of suburban rat
race sensibilities and you get an
overwhelming neurosis in need of
repudiation.

Instead what Kazan actually
provides is a portrait of an over-
sexed executive enmeshed in the
corporate lies of an advertising
firm and a frigid marriage. When
he isn't plugging brand name
cigarettes in mediocre advertising
campaigns, he cheats on his wife
with the regularity of a chain
smoker. His erotic, suicidal bent,
that prevents him from gaining
control of his situation, finally
confronts Eddie in the midst of
his infantile evolution. Yet it is
hard to believe that Eddie could
be or ever was sensitive to any-
thing except orgasm.

Kirk Dougias as Eddie produces
a tremendous amount of physical
energy and anguish but cannot
convince us that Eddie's attempts

to change his life have to do with

anything beyond satisfying the
itch in his erogenous zones. Mr.
Douglas, long ignored as a dim-
pled chin muscleman instead of

being adjudged a serious actor, in

sincere in his projection of the
core of Eddie’s neurosis. It in not
his fault that the character eludes
any true sympathy. Kazan in to
blame for giving little depth to
this phallic symbol that walks like
a man.

Faye Dunaway, the cynical,
nympho secretary and third part
of the arrangement gives the best
performance. Her tart, blistering
comments about the nature of
Eddie's indecision and self-
-preoceupation are the film's most
truthful momenta. Her greatest
flaw is that she represents the acid
tongued truth teller who points
out everyone else’s faults while
ignoring her own sex oriented
short comings. As her disposition
becomes increasingly bitter that

L ‘ L a sour, selfish
caricature of the emancipated wo-
man. Her bitterness is authentic
but her reasoning less than mes-
sianic.

Deborah Kerr as Eddie's wife
looks as though she was exhumed
from the dead and acts about as
enthusiastically as a cadaver.
Richard Boone is nearly unintel-
ligible as Eddie’s strong man fa-
ther and Jume Cronyn as the
family lawyer has a few amusing,
sardonic lines to recite.

Despite this reviewers affinity
for Kazan as a quality filmaker, it
is obvious that he has succumbed
to utilizing flashy “now” tech-
niques to disquise the soap opera
inadequacies of his self pitying
script. Instead of a ﬁlm about a
man brutalized within his environ-
ment we get a film about the
horny escapades of an egoist
which is something less than real
and much less than the artistry
connected with the name Kazan.
