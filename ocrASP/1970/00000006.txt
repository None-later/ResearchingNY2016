centrate research unduly in a few
ﬁelds? What principles should gov-
ern the allocation of research re-
sources? What community services

should universities perform? To
what extent can the university
assume responsibility for the city,
the poor, the blacks?”

influenced by an absolute or semi
-absolute code of religion, morals.
politics. family or school. In
short, modern American society.
with its constant barrage of media
ﬂashing at the brain. lack of po-

litical understanding. lack of
strong religious ideology, frag-
mented or non-existent world-

view, is producing generations of
Jacob Horners.

This inability to make decisions
starts in small ways. You can't
decide what restaurant to go to.
They all seem about the same. It
grows to not being able to decide
what classes to take - within a
rather wide spectrum they are all
about equal. Soon it is impossible
to decide on a topic for a paper or
project. They all have their merits

and drawbacks. And then there’s a
job to consider. Jobs seem about
the same on an alternative-priority
scale. So you randomly pick a job
just as you randomly picked clas-
ses. restaurants and paper topics.
In fact, it started even before that
when you randomly picked a col-
lege and randomly decided to
major in English and then
switched to history. then to
drama, then back to history. then.
miraculously found American Stu-
dies which encompassed every-
thing and required no decision.

While floundering in this morass
of alternatives. all of them more
or less equal. you begin to find
possibly brief or long-lasting ways
to ease the pain of floundering.
Gradually, you become aware of
the fact that there are more finite
alternatives to this mentally de-
structive process of searching for
the “right” answer in sets of
“right” answers. There are posi-
tions to take that would in one
way or another put all of the
Jakes out of their misery.

by Mark Grand

Since the last issue of the ASP.

ﬁnish in the Capitol City Tourna-
ment held over the Christmas Va-

74-64; beating Hobart. 59.55; de-
feating Pratt 76-70; winning over
Potsdam, 65-53 and losing to
Southern Connecticut. 86-59.

The bench played an important
part in the Pratt and Potsdam vic-
tories as injuries and foul trouble
hampered the Danes. Injured on
the team are sophomore John
[lever and starter Alan Rcid. Reid
was hard in the Pratt game but
has since returned to the lincup.

Jack Jordan continues to lead
the Danes in scoring(16.7) and re
bounding (12ml). Jim Masterson.
scoring 18 points against Pratt. in-
creased his average to 11.1}. fol-
lowed by captain Jack Adams
(9.8). Alan Reid(9.6) and Steve
Sheehan (8.3). The team's dcfcn-
sive average dipped to 62.0. keep-
ing them among the nation's load-
ers in that category.

In its most recent encounter.
the Dane Five lost a tough over-
time contest to Cortland. 72-70.

T'wh 15 seconds remaining in
regulation play and Albany pm»
'ecting a two point advantage.
Cortland's Mike Eidcl netted lhc,
tying basket that sent the game
into overtime.

Albany led. 70-69. with 112510
go in overtime play. but Eidcl
then scored on a layup. and Earl
Rogers added a free throw with
13 seconds remaining to run lhc
score to 72-70. which pI'chd to
be the final count.

The Dimes led at halftime 37-32
and early in the second half held a

45-37 margin.

Hitting on 26 of 57 from the
field. 46%. Albany ilhot better
than any game thys far this year.
The Danes also outbounded Cort-
land by a 119-43 margin. but were
considerable hurt when Jack
Adams and Jim Masterson (the

starting backcourt) fouled out
early in the second half.

Jack Jordan led the team with
21 points and 14 rebounds whil-
Mastcrson added 14 points and
Adams 10. The Danes record now
stands at 8-6.
