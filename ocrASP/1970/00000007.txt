Crime on campus up 100%;
Security force still only 31 men

by Al Senia

incidean of crime on campus
hnvc skyrocketed more than one
hundred percent in the past year,
according to James Connolly,
chief of the SUNYA security
force. And the criticul situation is
not apt to improve as thorn are no
plans to hire additional men.

This gloomy picture is the end
result of a variety of causes. Al-
though thc amount of persons and
properly protected by security
has increased over the past your,
the number of patrolman has
stayed the same-- thirty one
(grouped into thrcc shifts).

Unbclicvubly, there is but one
investigator. He is responsible for
the follow-up work on EVERY
CASE. Since most arrests arc the
result of lengthy investigation,
there is an obvious problem.

All requests for increases have
been systematically turned down.

Furthermore, priority is pluccd
on kccping police at “fixed
posts," which they cannot leave.
Thus the responsibility for vir-
tually all policc patrolling falls on
the two patrol units. And a great
deal of THEIR time is occupied
by tasks such as transporting ill

Proposed Constitution
eliminates Greek vote

by Kathy lluscmun

Reform of thc present Student
Association Constitution was thel
subjcct of discussion at lust night's
(Tcntrul Council meeting,

The new constitution will be
present to the sludan body in a
referendum to bc held March Zil,
24,1md‘25.

One of the largest issues pro-
vidud for in the new proposal is
for lhc elimination of com-
mission-nppuintcd members on
Council. By this mllusurc, ull stu-
dents on Central Council would
be elected by the membership of
Student Association.

'l'wo Council members would
nh-‘o bc uppulntcd to each Com-
mission.

Under the present Constitu-
tion, l’nnhcllunic Council has two

students to the infirmary or hos-
pital. Last year, 730 such culls
were made. Each response ties up
one of the curs (half of the patrol-
ling force) for at least thirty min-
utes. Attempts to get a third
marked patrolling car or hire a

Connully also cited a dire need
for supervisors in each platoon to
assure cooperation and co—
ordinate efforts.

These requests, like the others,
are annually turned down by the
Bureau of the Budget.

And how does this bureaucratic
red tape effcct the student? In
January of 1969, there were 2]
thefts, Last January, there were
41. Criminal mischief cases in-
creased 60%. And burgulnries
doubled. Yet, in typical Alice-
In-Wondcrlund fashion, during
peak crimc hours only seven to
eight officers are on duty. Onc
policeman each is stationed in the
lecture complex (usually a private
Burns guard), at the desk in sc-
curity, ut the library, fine arts cen-
ter, us a watchman, und in the two
cars. To put it simply, [here are
scnrccly enough bodies to fill tho
posts.

voting members on Council. The
revised Constitution calls for two
non~voting Punhellcnic repre-
scntutivcs.

Only one of the many Council
members who are Grocks voted
for the continuation of the pre-
sent policy.

It was generally felt that
chunch were being attempted to
mnkc Council mornI democratic.
The retention of special souls for
iulcrcxt groups was thought to be
in violation of this mm.

The second installment of the
Constitutional Revision mectlngl
of Control Council will take place
next week. And the continuing
saga of long-winded trlvln argu-
ments will reoccur when Council
reconvenos.

 

What can be done to reverse the
situation? As a start, the funds
used to hirc private guards should
be diverted to the campus security
force SUNYA police are generally
younger and are batter acquainted

with campus problems.

Secondly, mobility should be
emphasized; putrolmcn at “fixed
posts” should be allowed to patrol
even though certain people who
demand extra protection may be-
come upset.

But the real solution lies with
the student himself. As a start,
Chief Connolly would like
SUNYA students to realize the
police are present to “perform a
service instead of being viewed as
unnecessary interference with stu-
dents." Ultimately, that IS the
answer, for we must realize it is in
our interest to demand u stop to
the sacrificing of security needs.
The situation is reaching crisis
proportions. Past experience
shows thut a concerned student
body is the way to cut through
administrative indifference.

 

SA to subsidize

by Dave Peck

. Draft Counseling

Students at Albany State will soon be able to avail themselves of draft

counseling on campus. Central Council passed a bill on January 8,
which provides $30 to be used to set up a draft counseling library in the
Student Association office. Within a few weeks there will also be a

counselor available at all times.

The bill was introduced by Dave Ncufcld, head of the Political and
Social Positions Committee. A bookshelf with limited materials has
already been set up in the Student Association office and more books
are expected shortly. Some of the bookchs are for free and some for a
slight churgc. Ncufcld emphasizes that if :2 student can’t afford the
material he can have it for what cvcr he can afford, or for free.

The Albany Pcncc Ccntcr, along with I’SP, plans to train the draft

counselors. Anyone who would

like to become a counselor should

come to CC 346 at 3 pm. on Tuesday, February 17 for a short meeting
explaining the type of training one has to go through to become a draft
counselor. Those who can’t attend should call 7-8756.

Draft counseling is not draft evasion or resistance. A Counselor will
tcll n student his options and his alternatives. He willnol. tell a student

what to do and will not make any decisions for the student. Ncufeld

feels that ii. is important not to
wait until the last moment for
draft counseling but. to get it be-
forc you register. it in also import-
ant thut RA‘s sould have some
knowledge about draft counseling.

In the past SUNYA studs-mgr:
who wanted advice on the drqu
could go to the Albany Peace Cen-
ter or speak to u fuculty member
who was a draft counselor.
SUNYA us an institution doesn't
have any draft counseling for its
students. However, the college
does have a very large Placement
Office though, which will try to
ﬁnd you a job and even a place in
the armed forces, when you grud-
uate. The Library only has four
books on the draft. The Book-
store hus a few books on the draft
but at a higher price than the Stu-
dent Association. Therc is litera-
ture available in CC 346. Those
who want counseling should call
7-3430 and leave their name and
number.

State moves
on Blaine
A mendment

by Barry Kirschner

Movement has been taken in the
State Legislature to repeal the
‘Blaine Amendment." wthh bans
the use of public funds for schools
with religious affiliations, in one
of the ﬁrst significant votes of this
session. The Senate voted 41~15
(14 of 15 dissenting votes coming
from Senators with constituencies
within New York City) in favor of
repeal.

In order to do away with the
Blaine provision, an amendment
to the New York State Constitu-
tion is needed. Amending the con-
stitution is needed. Amending the
constitution necessitates legisla-
tion passed by two separately
elected bodies plus approval of
voters in a statewide referendum.

Should the repeal be effected, it
would give the state the go-uhead
to subsidize parochial schools.
State appropriations to religiously

affiliated schools can also be seen
u a subsidy for parents seeking to
avoid sending their children to an
integrated school system.

The state’s decision-makers will
be facing significant problems in
the upcoming weeks(before legis-
lators vncute Albany to reacqunint
themselves with their constituen-
clcs.) Legislation concerning edu-
cation, drugs, and abortion reform
are among the most importent to
be debated in the Capital.

Being an election year, New
York State politics will feature an
exceptional amount of mud
slinging. Governor Rockefeller
who made his economy pitch last
year (6% across the board cuts),
may be seriously hurting in No-
vember, especially with com-
muters on tho subways and Long
Island Rail Road.

Although educators, welfare rc-
cipients, commuters, and the
cities have been crying out for
more state aid, the governor and
Republican leglslntlve leaders have
promised no new taxes for this
year. Democratic leaders have do-
