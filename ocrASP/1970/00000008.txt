ALIANY STUDENT PRESS

:Interact breaks down barriers
between faculty and students

  

the State University Committee to research the goals and future of the

State University system.

 hochberg

 

by Sharon Philipson

You say you're unhappy. Why?
Why are you here? Why are you
playing a role which you do not
like? You're lost in a world of
concrete and glass. What can you
do about it? Interact!

Loneliness is sad. Life is un-
certain. I’eopte are apathetic.
Faces. Strange faces. We see them
every day. Would you really be
happier any place else? Smite! Be
happy! It’ll make you feel a lot
better.

So you've first failed three ex-
ama. So you don't get along with
your roommate. Go out! Explore!
Communicate! Don't be afraid!

Love, you may ask yourself, will
I ever find it? Will! ever know the
companionship, the affection of
someone who accepts me for what
I am and who enjoys being with
me? Friend, go out and find it.
What's holding you back?

Albany student to study future
of State University system

by Vicki Zelden

Doug Goldschmidt, an under-
graduate at the University and a
member of tin" University Senate,
has been named by Chancellor
Samuel B. Gould to a panel to
research the goals and future of
the entire State University system.

Chancellor Gould announced
the establishment of the “Panel
on University Purposes” to look
into the University's aims and ob-
jectives and discuss specific topics
affecting its future, such as the
much debated open admissions
proposal.

Goldschmidt, a senior political
science major from Elmont, L.I.,
is a member of the national de-
bate club honorary TKADSR, and
has been actively involved in the
student-faculty committee plan-
ning a new General College.

The Chancellor’s panel consisLs
of some 50 members, including
community leaders, legislators,
educators and six students, each
from different state university
campuses. Goldschmidt, a tem-
porary member of the panel itself,
is a member of the committee
doing research on universities’
trends and changes in all areas.
The information gathered by this
group is then submitted 1.0 the
panel for discussion and and
analysis.

The task of the panel has been
divided into six general areas.
“The Changing Educational Man-
date" is one. Its goal is to realize
and project what high school level
achievement students entering the

University will have. And, with
this projection, be able to forsee
what courses will be needed at the
college level in the future.

"The Students and the Univer-
sity" is an area that will consider
the University's responsibilities to
the student as well as to his par‘
ents. This division will also at-
tempt to define student responsi-
bilities and rights.

“The University's Role in
Society“ is a topic dealing with
the questions of what responsi-
bilities does the University have to
the society, and how much of a
role should the society play in
shaping the University.

There then is the topic entitled
“The Advancement of Know-
ledge" which just might be during
enough to analyze teaching tech-
niques. This topic also includes
questions on research and its ultiA
mate effects on the University and
society.

“The Prospects of Support" is
an area concerned with finding
out. where and how aid will come
in the future. It is also involved in
discovering how University act-
ions may or may not affect the
supply of aid.

The last topic of study, entitled
“Structure and Governance" is in-
volved in discovering what the
best form of University ad-
ministration is. It is an attempt
to discover what roles in policy
formulation should be assigned to
students, faculty, administrators,
and community groups.

The major goal of the Chan-
cellor's "Panel on University Pur—
pose" seems to be that of pro-
jection. Projection so that the
University can be and will be in
the years to come “all that it
should be." it is an attempt at
anticipation rather than waiting
for that which could be an-
ticipated to come unexpectedly.

Are you content to go from one
class to another, to study. to eat
and to steep? There is so much
more to life than this. Get out and
discover the vast world which
exists beyond the limits of this
university. Interact! It's a pleasant
ex erience.

ie down, close your eyes,
relax. Now stand up and with
your eyes still closed, feel your
way around the room. Look fora
partner. Communicate. These in-
structions were given to all those
who attended the Interact-- a time
when, with trained group leaders,
people in the University can inter-
act with one another in a positive
manner. Why Interact? “Because
everyone in the University Com-
munity has asked-- demanded that
people listened, talk, interact in
order that learning be vital, viable,
and relevant." This was the pur-
pose as stated by the formulating
committee of Interact.

Those students faculty, and ad-
ministrators that attended Inter-
act were subject to an almost
mystical process of mingling. The
idea was to interact, first with the
group as a whole. Then each per
son was to find a partner and talk

The writing

to him,'ask him questions. What
makes you happy, sad? What are
you afraid of? What do you want
most out of life?

The next step was for each pair
to find another pair. Each mem-
ber of the quartet then talked
about what he was most ashamed
of and most proud of. Then two
quartets got together. In this
group of eight came the ultimate
interaction. What all the varied
discussion boiled down to was the
conclusion that there was a need
for increased communication and
interaction.

The event concluded with a few
exercises which tested one's trust
of the friends one had made.
Finally everyone was given the op-
portunity to say or do anything
he felt like saying or doing.

This innovative, novel approach
is a means by which one can break
down the barriers between faculty
and faculty, student and student,
and student and faculty. It was
developed in a world where closer
communication between people is
needed. There is something about
Interacts which might bring about
a better University, perhaps even a
better world.

‘Save Gerry Wagner’

by Carol Hughes

“Save Gerry Wagner" the signs
read, and on Tuesday afternoon,
some 50 ‘friends of Gerry' met for
that purpose. Wagner's personal
position was explained, and sev-
eral suggestions for student action
initiated at the session. Wagner
has not been given term renewal,
and expects to take legal action to
have this decision reversed.

A significant debate developed
over whether students should act
for Wagnei as an individual case,
or as part of a larger issue. Con-
cern was voiced that the situation
reflected a dangerous pattern of
disregarding student opinion mak-
ing University decisions.

Similiarities between Wagner’s
denial of term renewal, the situa-
tion of Waterman and Rhodes
last year, and the present dif-
ﬁculty faced by Tucker in the His-
tory Department also were dis-
cussed.

Information was deemed the
most pressing problem. “Rumors
spread faster than real problems,”
one student complained.

An open meeting will be held
Thursday evening in the Lecture
Center for further planning and to
hopefully broaden student sup-
port. Advertising in the ASP and
on WSUA will be utilized to
"spread the word."

A table will be set up in the
lobby of the Campus Center with
petitions urging University re-
versal of the decision denying
Wagner term renewal. Individuals
soliciting signatures will also be
expected to "tell people what is
happening,” and to further gain
support for student action.
