The Senate

After two months of debate tlte University Senate
ﬁnally voted on and approved a resolution cori-
demning “the intervention of the United States in
the affairs of tlte nation of Vietnam." The general
disorder of previous meeting (“These meetings are
‘bullshit’ “ one distraught faculty member screamed
at a December l%9 meeting) was replaced lich-
ruary I0 by a productive arid responsive atmos-
phere.

This was bound to Itappen. One point many critics
don't seem to understand it that participatory dem-
ocracy requires periods of flux and self-appraisal. Or
to put it another way. everyone has to Iiave their
say. During the last two months most factions in the
Senate had their say. and this proved valuable!. The
vacuous arguments (The wIto-needs-a-Seiiatc- anyw-
ay contention for example) and the meaningless
rhetoric dissolved under the force of expediency:
time was short and issues were pressing
The meeting was a breath of fresh air in the
interest department also. The blandness 0f “dc-
corurn” was replaced by the old Iinglisli system of “0"-
speaking your mind. For example when John Reilly
of the English Department stood up to deride the

To the Editor:

bill

, Living Affairs Commission brought up a bill which
'5 would grant commuter students preferred parking
over resident students. A check with security re‘
vealed that there are approximately three times as

many commuter vehicles registered on campus as

 

resident vehicles.

The problem that arises becomes most severe
during the winter months. Resident students tend to
leave their cars parked in the first few rows of the
Student's lot. This forces commuters to part further
away from campus. These commuters are required
to use their car each day, in order to attend classes.
While they walk through the winter weather, resi-
dent’s cars are left in the closest parking spots.

It is for these reasons that I proposed the bill to
LAAC. Although we realized the possibility that

some resident students use their cars for work or
student teaching, we believe this number to be rela-
tively small and feel that this new rule will benefit

 those students who are totally dependent upon their
. cars for school.

Comment

Senate for its “indirect morality." people clapped
and people booed. The same thiiig Iiappencd when
Douglas (ioldscltmidt. a student. voiced oppositiort
to making the University responsible for individual
r'norality. Whoever the speaker and whatever his posi-
tion. each senator who spoke experienced the kind
of personal coiifrontaion needed indecision making.

Alas Tuesday‘s meeting was a good catharsis for
all. Decisions were made. people spoke up. and a lot
of uptiglitness disappeared.

The ASI’ will soon start covering Albany ('in
news. The ('in Editor's first feature is an inlcrvrew
with Mayor lirastirs ('orniiig.

We initiated this coverage for two reasons. First.
there was ll lack of city news coverage in the past.
Second. litany students living on campus have de-
veloped an Ivory Tower complex. These people
scent to think all their physical. social, and iii-
tcllectual needs are takcrt care of within the borders
of I’criiiteler Road. They see little need for explora-

Visitations: Counter-balance

by Joe Stringer

 

 

I represent no one but myself. I
do not purport to speak for cori-
servativcs. reactionaries. students.
or any other group. I speak only
for myself,

Likewise, when I vote for a per-
son to represent me, I expect him
to perform certain specific actions
for me. I do not expect him to
speak for me unless I direct him
to. I never expect him to think or
value for me.

This brings me to the Faculty
Senate resolution condemning the
Vietnam War, passed in a special
meeting Monday.

The purpose of the Faculty Sen-
ate was outline in the by-Iaws ap-
pearing in the 1969-70 Faculty
Handbook.

“Section (I: Responsibilities of
the Faculty:

3.1. The Faculty shall be res-
ponsible for the development of
the educational program of the
University and for the conduct of
the University's instruction, re-
search and service programs. sub-
ject to the provisions of the New
York State Education Law and
the policies of the Board of True-
tees.

3.2 To discharge these responst-
bilities the Faculty shall create a
Senate and shall delegate its
power to the Senate... ."

At no place iii the by-Iaws is
there provision for the Faculty
Senate to present policy positions
on issues not concerning the
iibovc responsibilities. Yet the
Senate has done just that. What
then is the nature of such an ac-
tion?

Every individual has the respon-
sibility of evaluating events
around him aan acting on his
value choices, Too often today.
the individual allows the group to
speak for him. or ullowa his rep~
resentative to not outside his au-
thority.

There is only one type of person
who will accept such an offering:
the person who wants power over
others.

In this root is tltc true nature of
apathy and dictatorship. The per
son who does not care to control

those who irct for him. who ah-
dicateii his responsibility to some-
one chic is the WORST of the
apathetic and a threat. because of
his apathy. to

representative

govornmcnt. The person who
readin accepts a blank check to
extend his authority to act for his
constituent is the "father" of the
dictator.

The Faculty Senate has gone far
beyond its authority, It has spo<
kcit out for the beliefs and morals
of the university as a whole. It
seems that I must remind the Sea-
atc that the University is itot an
entity in itself. but a collection of
individuals, many of whom do not
support their action or their
stand. As long as one individual
disagrees with the stand of the
Senate. the Senate can not posv
sibly represent him. This action.
then. is an outright usurpation of
the right of the individual to his
own beliefs anti the expression of
those beliefs for himself.

If members of the Faculty Scir
ate wish to take a stand on any
issue. they may circulate a peti-
tion for support. But to assume
the rigltt to speak for arty person
without his express consent is to
deny his right. to speak for him-
self.

Sincerely,
Richard Gurian

The War

To the Editor:

it seems to me that we veterans
who know mud. bombs and death
do not write many letters to the

newspapers.
Do you recall Mauldin’s Joe and
Willy cartoons? Those grimy,

cynical combat men portrayed a
theme that a lot of the homeguard
missed. “We're doing the job. But
don't believe what you hear. and
only half of what you see."

You won't find Joe and Willy
condemning the youngsters who
protest war. Turn the clock back
and Joe and Willy would be with
them.

The fire-caters and go-get-‘em
patriots arc emotional. but not
convinced enouglt to throng the
reeruitiitg offices. Not counting
aged congressmen, frustrated

housewives, munitions bene-
ﬁciaries. and brass who were
pruned of all imagination in their
plebe year. there still should be
enough bloodthirsty. gullible vol-
unteers to fill out the platoons.

You too can be a hero. The re
cruiting offices are plentiful and
over-staffed. No waiting.

The pay is good. The military
gets 85 billion for war this year,
while 19 billion for domestic ser-
vices combined isvetoed.

You won’t meet Joe or Willy or
me at the training camp. We‘ve
been there. And we’ve learned to
count.

We know that counting all
l9§§§§ North Vietnam has had
1.600.000 casualties since 1961.
In proportion. the U.S.A. would
have to lose 15 million to match
it. These N.V.losses are the great-
est in the history of warfare.

Fighting men often learn to re-
spect their enemy more than they
do their own leaders and poli-
ticians. If Roger’s Rangers and the
Green Mountain Boys and Wash-
ington's Continental Line were to
meet N.L.F. veterans they would
have much in common. They
would not have differences worth
fighting over.

This is what spurs the endless
ﬂow of crude propaganda which
smothers American thought and
morality. Joe and Willy and I
don’t believe it -- and a lot of
Americans are ceasing to believe
it.

We citizen soldiers can win any
war that's forced on us, but we
know a dishonorable overseas ad-
venture when we see one.
Would George Washington and his
staff have called this murder?
We’ve dropped bombs by the ton
for 5 years. The civilian casualties
and murders are well- document-
ed.

Combat veterans rarely write to
newspapers. We do not sit in cab-
inet meetings or at peace talks.
Would events go differently if we
did?

Sincerely.
M. Daniels

Universi

l ARTICLES OF

The growth ofo~ir university and the development ofi’ts character
depend to a large extent upon the administrative system of Con-
tinuing Appointment. Tenure is granted to those faculty members
who have proven themselves to be of the valuable material that builds
the character of a university. A position on the permanent faculty
ensures the continuity of the institution's reputation. Decisions that
form the permanent faculty are made on the departmental level and

are reviewed through the ad-
ministrative ladder.

How much of the student voice
must be heard for the wisest con-
sideration of each case? When and
where are these voices transmitted
and received? Why is there so
often a heated discussion on new
departmental decisions?

The following article observes
one case in the question of tenure.
In the future. the ASP will publish
articles dealing with the de-
veloping elaboration of adminis-
tration policy and the de‘
velopmenls among current issues.

By Cami Hughes

“We have to be indulgent. The
University is doing its best to keep
pace and to see that things are
done properly.” With this com-
ment Dr. Clara Tucker of the His»
tory Department succinctly and
uniquely defined her attitude
toward the issue of her being de-
nied tenure.

Finding herself at the center of
a large student movement to have
the University's denial of tenure
reversed, Dr. Tucker has become a
rallying point for some advocates
of greater student power in Uni—
versity decisions. Like Gerry Wag-
ner. and the Waterman and
Rhodes case of last year, Dr.
Tucker’s ease reflects a negation
of student wants and needs.

Dr. Tucker personally intends to
accept. whatever decision the Uni-
versity delivers. Her case is pre»
sently being reviewed by the Uni-
versity Committee on Continuing
Appointments.

In response to student protest.
as manifested in the action of the
History Students Association, the
History Department reviewed Dr.
Tucker's case and recommended
her for tenure. No final decision
has yet been reached.

“PUBLISH 0R PERISH"

Publicity by the History Stu-
dents Association attempted to
stereotype the issue as a matter of
"Publish or perish," a label which
Dr. Tucker strongly disputed. She
termed it “a crude way to put it
and not a very accurate one."

“The issue is perhaps put better
in terms of a question. The de-
partment is going to grow, de-
velop. and increase in excellence.
In considering retaining faculty
members. the department should
ask the question: ‘How well suit-
ed will this person be to serve the
department in the future?”

According to the History Stu-
dents Association, a group that
spearheaded the ntovc to save Dr.
Tucker, Tucker's excellence as a
teacher was overlooked in con'
sidcriitions of her lack of publica-
tion. Dr. Tucker is now unpub-
lished. although she stated that
she is presently at work towards
some future publication. Her coit-
ception of the role of the teacher
is significant, for the sludcnt
group contends (as published in
the December 16, 1969 issue of
the Albany Student Press):

“Dr. Clara Tucker is one of the
few outstanding undergraduate

teachers... Her classes are always
ﬁlled to capacity: a result not
only of her popularity, but at tes-
tament to her ability as a teacher.

She has inspired students to learn
and continue in their study of his—
tory."

Dr. Tucker has a high regard for
teaching and the responsibilities
of the teacher to her students.
However. she argues. quite sur-
prisingly. that students' interest
might be overlooked in favor of
higher criteria.

“Students are concerned with
problems now. The administration
is committed to the future. It is
difficult to reconcile the two.“

STUDENT ACTION

Dr. Tucker's acquiescent atti-
tude prompted a request for her
opinion of the student action in
her behalf, since she had state that
she would comply to the Univer-
sity's decision without attempts
toward legal action. Although she
personally appreciated the stu-
dents' efforts for her benefit she
personally has chosen to remain
uninvolved in their activities.
Nevertheless, Dr. Tucker views

the student action as positive.
Through her personal service on
the Student Affairs Council. slic
appreciates the need for students

to express their opinions.

However, she stated that the
many avenues of repression now
being open to students should be
the means of making their views
known.

Dr. Tucker also introduced an
interesting aspect of the student
movement in her case. She quea-
tioned student understanding of
what criteria were used in recom-
mending a particular faculty mem-
ber for tenure.

TENURE QUESTION

The University is changing in its
development into a large institu-
tion. Along with this is a "move
towards generally accepted stand-
ards." especially in the context of
granting tenure.

Most tenure recommendations
are made in accordance with the
criteria established by the Ameri-
can Association of University Pro-
fessors, with which most college
instructors are familiar. The Uni-
versity’s new guidelines. soon to
be studied by the University Sen-
ate. follow those ideas quite close-
ly.

Furthermore. it is doubtful
where Dr. Tucker's case may be
thought of as a blow to strident
need. Besides the evaluation of
present achievements, the depart-
ment is compelled to consider the
future.

"Just because a person is hired

 

race 7

for a term does not mean that he
will be given a job until he re-
tiree," Dr. Tucker reiterated.

If, as a malt of student ef-
forts and departmental attempts
to have the Tucker case reviewed.
the University reverses its decision
and grants her tenure, what would
be her feelings about staying on at
this institution?

“If I didn't feel that I could
respect the department, students
and faculty, I wouln't stay. I
would look for another job...."

WILL COMPLY

All in all, Dr. Tucker feels that
she has been treated fairly by her
department. Although she hopes
for a favorable response, she plans
to accept whatever decision the
University committee renders.

Petitions have been circuiateu,
meetings have been held. Con-
cerned students have spread their
views to all of the University com-
munity. Dr. Tucker’s excellence as
a teacher has been lauded. (As one
of her former students
put it: “She‘s excellent, and
coming from one of the two stu-
dents who failed her course, that’s
quite a testimonial.") The Depart-
ment of History has sent its re-
commendation. Hopefully the Uni-
versity will wisely consider these
aspects of the question in making
its final decision.
