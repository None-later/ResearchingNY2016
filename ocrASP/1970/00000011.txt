ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

THE ASP SPORTS

Danes are Victorious :

Crush New Paltz 71-55; Reid Excels

by Jay Marsha“

Tuesday night the Albany STate'
basketball team broke a two game
losing streak by defeating New
Paltz 71-55. The team was coming
off a tough loss to Cortland last
Saturday which as Coach Sauers
admitted. took a lot out of the
team. The team did not shoot
very well. but was offset by the
usual tight defense and good re-
bounding.

New Paltz had a decided height
advantage throughout the game.
Albany attempted to counteract
this height problem by playing a
running. pressing game. The press
was effective. however State failed
to convert on many fast-freak
situations. Coach Saucrs readily
admits that the Danes are not a
running team. but such a situation
calls for the smaller team to play a
running game. Jack Jordan scored
nine of his thirteen points in the
first half as Albany jumped out to
a 33-21 advantage at intermission.
After half-time Jack Adams hit
eight quick points prevonting New

Paltz from closing the lead.
Adams and Al Reid, who paced all
scorers with nineteen points. led
the attack in the second half as
Albany pulled away.

The important play of the re-
serves was a key in Albany‘s suc-
cess. Ed Arsenau, displaying more
confidence than in the beginning
of the season and Mike Hill both
came off the bench and contri-
buted in the victory. Hill showed
a willingness to battle under the
boards and. along with Jordan.
Steve Sheehan. and Reid. helped
Albany outrcbound New Paltz.
After the game. Sauers commend-
ed the play of the subs and added
that forward Jim Sandy has been
the most valuable replacement.
but wasn't used much against New
Paltz becnusc none of the for-
wards were in foul trouble.

Those who arrived al the start
of the varsity game missed half
the show. The freshmen tcnm.
now 10-3. ran over the New I’alt'l.
Frosh 92-55."l‘lic Freshmen fen-

tured a balanced attack with the
starters averaging around ten
points each per game. The team
also has excellent depth and
Coach Lewis substitutes freely.
Coach Sauers believes at least five
players will move up to the varsity
next year. They will face a tough
opponent Saturday night in the
Siena Frosh. At the end of the
Frosh game, the Albany varsity
came onto the floor and warmed
up to the beat of Sly and the
Family Stone and other records.
The team held a meeting Monday
and decided to add some music to
the Warm-ups. Sauers did not
object so. courtesy of Hill. music
was supplied.

Saturday night, Albany meets
its traditional rival. Siena. The in.
dians are led by 15-7 center Bob
Hermann who poses a large prob-
lem for the Albany defense. Ac-
cording to Saucrs. Albany was
“flat” against New Palt'l. and must
play better to win Saturday night.
Come early and enjoy the show.

Grapplers edged by; Post 22-18

The Albany State wrestling
team dropped a close 22-18 de-
cision to the Pioneers from CW.
Post on Wednesday. The loss left
the matmen wilb an overall 1-6
record.

The Danes registered three pins
and one decision in totaling up
their 18 points. Pinning their op-
ponents were sophomore Jim
Nightingale. 158 lbs.; sophomore
Mike Mueller. 190 lbs and fresh-
man heavyweight Herman l'lil-
liard. The other victory went to
freshman Phil Mims. 167 lbs. who
decisioned his man 12-5.

Just as Coach Garcia was mel-
lowing in the good fortune of
having a 100% healthy team. a
major setback befell the grapplers
as Tim Coons injured his knee and

AMIA basketball continued this
week on its road to determining
the teams in each league that will
participate in the championship
playoff series.

In League 1. EOP 1 continued to
set the pace with a 53-25 pasting
of STB. The winners were paced
by Carl Jones rind Bobby Wright
who notched 111 and12 points re-
spectively. Jeff Soperstone led
STB with ti markers. Potter Blub
continued to follow close behind
in second place winning from the
Underdogs by forfeit. This left
EOP with an unblem shed 0-0
slate. one game in front of Potter
which is 8-1.

In League “A action. KB.
paced by Alan Zaremba and Kurt
Legler upended Al'A 55-33. Doug1

was unable to compete in the Post
contest. As the Coach sees it. the
absence of Tim could have been
the deciding factor in the out-
come of the match.

Despite the unimpressive record
amassed up to this point in the
season. several things should be
noted about this year's learn. A
lack of depth and experience can-
not be compensated in any way
and hits hardest in a sporl like
wrestling. Not only does it
eliminate the much needed indi-
vidual competition but has forced
the wrestlers in the lower weight
classes to compete one class above
their regular weight. Nevertheless
Coach Garcia is quite proud of the
job these boys are doing under
such conditions.

Chesser tallied lll points for the
losers. League llB play saw the
Nails. bcbing Rich Nussbaum's 20
points. whip crow 1 by a 56-39
count. lion Brooks scored If) for
the losers.

The team is young. which leads
the Coach to believe that the fu-
ture of wrestling looks favorable.
The spirit anrl dcsirc are there and
invaluable experience is being ob-
tained every day.

As for the near future. the mat-
men face New Paltz. Harpur. and
Marist. three matches Coach Gar-
cia looks to as excellent chances
')f victory.

Vol. W" No. 3

New consultation
policy approved

Copies of the University Senate's resolution condemning the war in
Vietnam will be circulated to various elected representatives and
selected national media in compliance with a request made by the
Senate at their meeting yesterday afternoon.

Also at the Senate meeting the Executive Committee reported
on its activities since January 19 when it was authorized to act for the
Scnntc on pending matters. Towards the end of the Senate meeting a
number of new resolutions were presented by various student senators
which will be discussed at the next regular Senate meeting.

The Guidelines for faculty-student consultation prepared to
implement last spring's Senate policy statement on student
participation hrch now bccn officially adopted. These guidelines slate
Ibal the primary rcsponsibilily for drawing up student consultation
procerlurcs lies at the departmental lr-vcl. The guidelines acknowledge
that the nu-chanism of implementation are varied. However. it is
necessary for each department or unit to formulate a statement of
procedure. which is In be filerl with the Vicc~(/‘hairmnn of the Senalc.
These statements should “make explicit the circumstnnccs and
manner in which student opinion will be oblaincd. the subject matters
scheduled for discussion. the machinery to be employed for selection
of student representatives, the grievance procedure and such other
provisions as may appropriately bc madc a mntlcr of record as having
been dccirlcd or agreed to."

The recommenrlalions on tcnurc and continuing appointments as
approved by thc Council on Promotions and Continuing Appoint»
mcnts aan the Executivv (Yommittcc wr're discusscd. it was the sense
of some Senators that. the report was vaguely worded in places and it
was decided to return the report to the Council on Promotions and
Continuing Appointments to be reconsidered. Generally the rcporl as
presented to Senate seems to ignore a substantial number of
suggcslions made by the faculty-student committee on l".illl‘t' which
would have guarantcerl the role of the student.

Five new resolutions were introduced by various student senators
anrl were referred to the appropriate Senate Councils. They will be
discussed at the next regular Senate meeting.

’l'hcsc rcsolutions inclurlc the establishment of a review committcc
in thc RPA department. a parking policy which will not. discriminatc

'l‘h is position was first
challenged by Farmingdnlc
students who. when refused use of
school facilities. held services in
the parking lot. The group was
granted use of an oil-campus
meeting place and. since Uctobcr
1008. masses have been held at
l"armingdalc.

At l.l1t‘ request of SUNY chal
(lounscl John (Irnry. in October
1069 Attorney Gcneral Louis
Lefkowitz released a statement
that. in his opinion. “in those
situations in which students re-
quest permission to use University
facilities for the purpose of
holding religious ser-
vices....permission may be granted
provided that the provision of
such facilities will not otherwise
interfere with campus administra»
tion."

Lefkowitz's reasoning was
based on the view that students.
like “prison inmates. State bos~
pital patients and maritime cadets.
were confined to the particular
State property involved and. with-
out the provision of religious
facilities to hem at that place.
would be deprived of their right

to practice their religions.‘

On-campus religious services
begun here i January when
Roman Catholic students. unable
to reach Parkwood East (their
regular meeting place) because of
snow. held a mass in Stuyvesant
Tower (Dutch Quad).

No interpretation. i.e. guide-
lines of the Lefkowitz opinion
had been received at the time of
this mass. so Vice-President
'l‘horne. Mr. Neil Brown. director
of Campus Center. and Mike
Lampert. Vice-Chairman of Reli-
gious Affairs Commission. met to,
as Mr. Brown put it. “get the
problem solved."

They decided that. until further
clarification of the Lefkowitz
statement becomes available. stu-
dents requesting CC rooms. chairs.
etc. for religious services be given
the same consideration as those
wanting use of the Center and its
equipment for any other purpose.

“I will recommend to the
University Council." state Thorne.
"that we make facilities available
for corporate religious services in
the Campus Center. but not for
funerals and weddings for which
we are not equipped."

A student from the Environ-

the environmental forum. biology
club members and any other
interested purlics were encouraged
to attend hearings where any
alteration of the university's aur-

roundings would be discussed.

Dr. Thorne replied that “he
sympathizes rind agrees. but not
much can be done with University
property because State University
construction fund is more or less
autonomous.

The fact that the State Univer-
sity was once a golf course and
country club was also brought up.
However. today we have trees

The administrators claim that
