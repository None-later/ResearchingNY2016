Indian Quad's low rise dorms
which were estimated to be
completed by Aug. 15,1970 now
will take at least until Sept. 15.
This will cause a great many
complications since school will be
beginning in early September.
Motels and "increased occupan-
cy“ will have to be employed chn
though it is already at a maxi-
mum.

The availability of security
guards on Alumni quad was also
discussed. There is a proposal for
the installment of special radios in
the downtown dorms to be used
for emergency purposes.

See Europe
by untour

Girls: Have you ever been to
the top of the Eiffel Tower? Have
you ever ridden around Venice in
a gondola? Ever thrown your
coins in the Trevi Fountain of
Rome or sunbathed on the Ri-
viera? If you’ve always dreamed
of going to Europe, the summer
of 1970 is your opportunity!

NBES, the Netherlands’ Bureau
for Foreign Student Relations,
sponsors two types of untours
each summer. Both untours in-
clude student parties, concerts,
theater performances, picnics, and
individual freedom with infor-
mality. This is the ideal way to see
Europe for the first time.

The NBBS representative, Dies
derik A. W. Quint, will be on
campus Thursday, February 19 in
Ed. 22 to speak with all interested
students. Please call June at

American Negro are all included
in the ISEPOD program. The In

the School of Education, was de-
signed to “help pre-service and in-

Placement announces bleak
job outlook for June grads

The job outlook for graduating
seniors this year is not a bright
one. according to the University
Placement Service.

Finding enough jobs to meet
tluI employment demand “may be
more difficult than in any year in
the previous decade," according
to Dr. Clinton J. Roberts, director
of placement.

School districts, the major
source of employment for
SUNYA graduates, have been hard
hit by budget cuts and have been
forced to cut back on special
programs and to increase the size
of classes rather than hire new
tcachcrs.

The effect on job seekers can
be seen in the fact that job leads
in education, including adminis-
trative positions. dropped from a
peak of 12,200 in 1067 to 7,000
last year. They arc expch to drop
still further. At thc same time, the

in general placement, including
industry. said Dr. Roberts, “even
physicists are beginning to find
problems." He estimated that at
least 60% of candidates seeking
general placement had prepared in
areas which have poor market-
ability. In addition, the Vietnam
War and the draft have created
intense competition for “safe”
jobs.

New policy

Continued from page 1

At present, Newman Associa~
tion is the only group making use
of the facilities. Roman Catholic
services have been scheduled in
(TC 1111') for 6 pm Saturday; 9am,
11 am, 5 pm and 9 pm Sunday,
along with special Lenten Services
on Tuesday, Wednesday. and
Thursday at 12 pm and 1 pm.

Finally, federal, state, and local
governments, the mainstay of
employment for the non-
specialist. have cut back their
hiring and increased minimum
requirements for becoming eligi-
ble for employment.

“It used to be that anyone who
achieved 80% on the professional
careers test was cmployable." Dr.
Roberts explained. “Even those
who did not achieve that grade
were sometimes employed. Now
the grade required for generalists
is 05% and the waiting list is
unbelievably long."

tending daily sessions which in-
clude guest speakers, panel discus-
sions, dramatizations, films, tours
of urban areas, and evaluations.

A very integral and exciting part
of the institute are the late night
bull sessions which allow the par-
ticipants to examine themselves
and their reactions to each other.
Personal prejudices are revealed,
carefully examined, and hopefully
destroyed.

This intensive program, how-
ever, does not terminate in
August Monthly sessions follow,
and the participants are taken on
two "field trips." One ISEPOD
group spent three days in Harlem
visiting “Harlem Teams for Self-
Help," Narcotics Rehabilitation
Centers, and Community Centers.

A trip to Roxbury, Mass. is pre-
sently being planned. These trips
expose the teacher to the true
background of the students they
will work with, which will benefit
both teacher and student in a
classroom situation. Monthly
newsletters, sent to all parti-
cipants, furnish pertinent informa-
tion about individuals, materials,
and techniques.

Check your
Checkbooks

Dr. Clifton C. Thornc, Vice
President for Student Affairs. has
expressed concern over the grow-
ing problem of stolen checks and
Checkbooks.

1n the matter of lost check
books, an immediate call should
be placed to the bank requesting
appropriate action to close or
freeze the account. This request
should be made in writing and
with all promptness for the
student's own protection.

According to Dr. 'I'hornc, inl'or»
mation has been received that a
substantial number of student
chcckbooks are either lost or
“picked up." Students are remind-
cd that such incidents must be
reported to the appropriate Uni‘
versin official.

 

'1 V n’s 
program to aid disadvantaged

by Maids Oringher
Sensitivity training, the study of

“disadvantaged” with a picture of
the black man, and other minority
groups. Questions such as “Who is
he?" and “What does he want?”
are explored and answered, and
the teacher begins to develop a
new awareness of himself in re-
lation to the black community.
This awareness can only be
achieved after careful observation
and interaction with the blacks on
their own terms.

These basic conclusions are then
applied in order to provide a suc-
cessful teaching experience with
disadvantaged children. The insti-
tute presents teachers with avail-
able teaching materials and tech-
niques; pre-service teachers in-
volved in th'“ program are given
teaching assignments in urban
III'GBS.

Funds for the ISEPOD program,
previously granted by the Federal
Government, have now been as-
sumed by the State under an Ur-
ban Teacher Preparation grant. All
participants are subsidized
throughout the program- the in‘
stitute provides rooms. mcnls, and
transportation free of charge.

Although no formal university
“credit” is given to the parti-
cipant, ISEPOD training is highly
regarded by urban schools. Over
eighty per ccnt of the participants
are slill involved in urban teach-
ing, in places including Ocean
Hill-Brownsville, Bedford Stuy-
vesant, Harlem, Watts and Detroit.

Any interested student who is
enrolled in the School of Educa-
tion and will be student teaching
in the 1970-71 school year is in-
vited to pick up an application
form from the secretary outside
of Room 317 in the Education
Building.
