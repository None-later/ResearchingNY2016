Most of the delegates at the Mobe convention were

Similarly. the plenary sessions on Saturday and
Sunday centered on facts and issues. When the
proposal for mass demonstrations in April came to
the floor most everyone had their say and most
everyone spoke directly and factually to the point.

The Student Mobilization (‘omnrittee conference

visitations ° a clear wall

by Frank Reynolds

 

 

The Constitution imposes a
clear wall between the govern-
ment— local. state and federal-
and the press.

From time to time. the govern-
ment tries to breach toe wall. and
such an attempt is underway right
now.

it must be turned back. for the
press is not an arm of a prosecutor
or a grand jury. It is not an agency
whose purpose is to help th(
government. It is much more an
agency whose purpose is to watch
the government and inform the
people of the country about its
actions. The press is not. rcproat
not. obliged to inform any area of
the government about the actions
of its citizens. but that is precisely
what faorne federal attorneys are
now trying to force the press to
do.

In recent days. a number of
subpoenas have been screed on
newapapcra. magazines and broad-
casters demanding tapes. and
other material gathered by report-
are but not published or broad-
cast. The material sought in to be
used in the preparation of cases
involving a faction of the Students
for a Democratic Society and the
Black Panthers. However, if the
haphazard use of the subpoena

power is accepted. there will be
no reason why a Democratic

prosecutor cannot use his office
to subpoena other material about
a Republican Mayor. or vice versa.
The opportunities for political
mischief and intimidation of
newsman and the people newsman
must. talk to will be. immeasurable
increased. Nobody will want to
talk freely to a reporter if he
suspects the reporter's notes..his
notes. not his published story or
boradcast report which is. of
course. availalbc to all...might be
subpoenaed by an authority un-
friendly to him.

This is not in any way a
question of preacrvtng secrecy; it
is a way of providing information.
If the sources of information are
afraid to talk to newsmen. it is
not the newsmen who will suffer.
It is the public who will be denied
information. I leave it to the
lawyers rind the managers of
newspapers and networks to de-
cidc their response to these
demands...

AS a reporter and a citizen. i
hope they will resist. And I hope
the Justice Department will clari-
fy its policy for the guidance of
prosecutors and grand juries. at all
levels.

ManW. .....»..............,.....e...

We have so many faults. We’re
aware of them and are trying to

grrtion to inform the people of the

gation we have...if our reporters

Supreme Court Justice William
0. Douglas. in a new book. has
stated that “revolution may prove
the only honorable alternative to
oppression by the American Ex-
tablishment." (N.Y.Times
2/1/70) Douglas attacks such
all-American institutions as the
Pentagon. the CIA, FBI, Presi-
dents Truman and Johnson. gov-
ernment and corporate bureau-
cracy. and racist practices by
police, employers and educators.
Sounding like one of the Chicago
Eight. he says “American acting as
a free man." He quotes Adolph
Hitler. who in 1932 said, “The
streets of our country are in
turmoil. The universities are filled
with students rebelling and riot-
ing...We need law and order,” as
the epitome of the ignorant Silent
Majority Man. Right On. Judgie.

Jack Schwartz
Chicago Eight
Students:

Just before Bobby Scale was
gagged and tied to his seat he
turned to Tom Hayden and Abbie
Hoffman and said wryly “I think
our number is coming up. I hope
they put us in the some clink.
They‘re uptight and they should
be because the conspiracy will
Win." Movement later a witneg
was asked a question as to Sealc's
activity. When Bobby demanded
the right to cross examine. Judge
Hoffman shouted at him to sit
down. Bobby stood up facing the
judge and knowing the risk he
took pointed and yelled “Facist
Pig! I will not sit silent. I have the
right to be my own counsel."
Hoffman. with the weight of
American corporate power behind
him. pointed back and repried.
“Marshalls gag and bind Mr.
Scale." Three marshalls rushed
toward Bobby. Dave Dellinger the
old pacificist. a heavy man,
greying and balding responded. He
threw himself between Bobby and
the marshalls moved in. Dellinger
was subdued and Seale bound.

Several weeks later Hoffman
declared a mistrial for Scale. and
sentenced him to four years. His
brothers in the MOVEMENT rose
up around him. He turned to
them and the gallery as the
marshalls came for him. His fist
went up. “Power to the PEO-
PLE." he called. He turned to
Hoffman rind looked at him. The
mar'shalls pulled him toward the
door that led to the federal prison
as the gallery erupted with shouts
and clenched fists.

The Trial of the Chicago 8
(10 including Bill Kuntsler and
Leonard Weinglasa) will have
similar roots for us. If Nixon or
the corporate power that backs
him believe that the removal of 10
courageous leaders will kill our
will to resist they are wrong.
Hoffman is the “machine gun" for
us. This and the “10’s” example
will only lay the groundword for
greater struggle.
There will be a rally Wednes-
day, at noon in front of the

To the Editor:

It is truly a sad situation for thr
members of a student body to be
so disinterested in the workings of
the University.

First. the general faculty agreed
this year to include 33 students in
the policy-making body for this
university center. thus making
that body a University Senate.
Now that students have the op-
portunity to meaningfully and
fully participate in the formul-
ation of policy relating to all
facets of the University, very few
members of the student body
bother to get off their desk
chairs — and make any effort to
voice their opinions. criticisms. or
suggestions. And yet everyone has
bitched so long and loud that stri-
dents don't have any say. We've
got it. let's use it.

Secondly, both the academic
calendar and the pattern of classes
are being changed for next year.
The ideas were bandied about for
quite a while before any changes
were made. yet few (if any) stu-
dents voiced any opinion on the
changes which will now effect
EVERY student who is here next

year.

Thirdly. Central Council put
forth a constitutional change fora
Student Association referendum.
Ole 429 students could be
bothered to vote out of a total
undergraduate enrollment of over
7.000 students.

Do you, the student body. want
an active part in the governance of
this University? Do you, the stu-
dent body. want to use the vote
you have in the formulation of
policy for your existence here?
Do you really care about the life
of this University? If you do. you
haven't shown it. Don’t be so
damned apatheticll

‘Price of My Soul" Captures
Devlin Spunk and Dedication

by Sharon Cooke

(CPS)--The autobiography of a
22 year old is a suspicious
undertaking no matter who is the
author. One can rightly question
the author's ability to perceive the
subject matter clearly. to stand
back at a distance far enought to
see what is relevant and what is
irrelevant. what is true and what is
false. But Bernadette Devlin is
exceptional in many ways. not the
least of which is her ability to tell
a good and an honest tale.

Tire Price of My Soul (which
refers not to the price at which
she is willing to sell out. but the
price she is willing to pay not to)
is a charming and readable ac-
count of Bernadette and her
struggles. her spunky Irishness,
her dedication. her intelligence.
her roots and family. It is not the
work of a brilliant. radical philo-
sopher. and belongs on the shelf
not so much next to Marx or even
Cohn-Bendit. but rather next to
Shaw‘s MAJOR BARBARA. She
chronicles her life from her birth
as third in a very poor family of
six children. her early learning to
disregard popular opinion. her
education. her political awakening
and growth. and finally to her
somewhat. farcical election to the

J oplin’s ‘Kosmic Blues’ Epitomizes
Her Exnression and Emotion

by Sue Hrycaj 1

After Janis Joplin dumped the
rest of “the Holding Company."
she very selectively compiled just
the right musicians to back her up
even more powerfully than be-
fore. Prior to her opening with the
new group. Janis was a little
apprehensive about whether their
sound would come across. As far
as I‘m concerned. her worries are
over.

“I Got Dem Ol’ Kozmic Blues
Again Mama!“ has been around
fora while now. but that certainly
doesn't diminish its value. This
album epitomizes Joplin.

"Try" is the first and longest
cut. Singing this. she gets rid of all
her inhibitions-so much so that.
at concerts. she sometimes loses
control. This is documented by
her recent arrest during a per-
formance of this song. resulting in
a charge of “profane language."
(Is there really such a thing as
profane language?)

“Maybe” makes the album. For
once. the background music al-
most equals Joplin’s singing. The
combination of instruments and
voice bolster and support each
other until they become in»
separable. Then they irrtcrtwinc
with each other and with your
mind until all three are one. This
song was done almost ten years
ago by a group which is now
extinct. but the difference is so
extreme that it takes a while to
recognize it as the same song.

“One Good Man" is an original
Joplin composition. It is con‘

cerned with the boredom of
“collecting men" and "wearing
them like notches on a gun." and
her search for the one right man.
As she voices throughout the
song. “One good man ain't much-
-it's only everything.”

The members of the group get a
chance to display their musical
ability in “As Good As You've
Been To This World." Actually.
I‘d rather they skipped the instruA
mentals and got right to Janis.
The philosophy of the song is that
whatever you put into your life.
however you treat other people.
as good as you are to this world.
“it's gonna want to be right back
to you."

The second side is launched by
“To Love Somebody.” Janis takes
this song and scrubs it with lye
soap. rather than giving it the Mr.
Bubble treatment it's been used
to. l’m not knocking the Bee
Gee's version. though. because
they also handled it well. it's just
that Janis breathes in new fresh-

ness and feeling into it and seems
to be talking of a love that is more
passion than “puppy.”

This is followed by another of
Janis' originals "Kozmie Blues." It
exemplifies all that has become
known as “Joplin Blues."

“Little Girl Blue" is my next-
to-favorite song on the album.
“Sit there. count your ﬁngers
what else is there to do?" That's
all you’ll ever have to count.
There's not much else in life that's
worth counting. It's a sad song
because. in a way. Little Girl Blue
is right. Janis can’t offer any
solution. only the consolation
that she knows how it feels.

In many of Janis’ songs, the
lyrics are poor. but the relative
paucity of the lyrics is more than
compensated for by her qualities
of expression and emotion.

People who don’t like Joplin
say that her singing is just a lot of
rasping. screaming noise. But a
train makes a lot of noise too. and
it sure goes places.

Mother of Parliaments. Despite
some major faults as far as what
has been omitted in the way of
solid ideological and sociological
thinking. every page of the book
is packed with Bernadette’s com-
pelling charm. intelligence. and
honesty.

Bernadette’s chapter on her
entry into her famed political
office. her disgust at the slow
inanities of Mother Parliament,
her being hounded by all matter
of freaks and pests is among the
best. For here the ridiculousness
of this poor girl‘s current situation
shines through with greatest clari»

ty.

She has had trouble adjusting
to Parliament and its pomp and
circumstance. and they to her:

“Some of them are indulgent
about my running up the stairs
and whistling in the corridors. but
there's a general feeling that I
ought to have more respect for
the dignity of Parliament; ought
not to be impatient with the
pomp and ceremony and time
wasted for ‘l-lats off. strangers!
Here comes the speaker!‘ I always
think of LORD OF THE FLIES
when they trot in with the Mace:
'l’ve got the conch;‘ there's no
doubt about it.“

She has had some trouble
adjusting to the fame her election
has attracted and to the somewhat
peculiar attentions of her fans:

“I was asked to ring the
international operator: a call from
America had been booked and
paid for. Thinking it had to be
important if a call from halfway
around the world had been paid
for. I rang the operator and got
routed through to Mrs. Typical
Yank. who says. “Well! Ah just
wanted to get speaking to the real
Bernadette Devlin!" And that's all
she wanted to say! Then she puts
her family on to say "Hello!" It
was the biggest circus in creation.
as far as I could see."

We see that she is not. as the
inance jacket copy states. “one of
the most extraordinary political
ﬁgures of the day." Extraordinary
political figures are the likes of
the men who engineered John
Lindsay’s election last fall and
Nixon's election and who would
have gotten McCarthy elected if it
hadn't been for the candidate. and
who needs them? No. Bernadette
is not a political figure at all.

She realizes exactly how much
she can and can’t do to remedy
the fundamental problems of
Jorthern Ireland. and she realizes

Ithat it may have been a mistake to
dupe her constituents into think-
ing that making Parliament work
for them was only a matter of
putting the right person in office.
“I can get a post box for Slate
Quarry. Slate Quarry is a small
dying village. the least of whose
worries but the only one I can
help'wigh. is the absence of a post
box. If you work it out, the
beggest economic scandal in Bri-
tain is that someone can earn
3.250 pounds (her salary) a year
for getting three fishing licences.
one clear-way to a garage, and a
couple of telephone kiosks."

Bernadette pledges that she's
going to leave Parliament (after
getting out of jail ﬁrst, I suppose)
and keep fighting the battle where
it must be fought. where it
counts-in the streets of Belfast.
And one day the hated Unionist
rule and the social order it has
created will go down for the last
time. “For half a century it has
misgoverned us. but it is on the
way out. Now we are witnessing
its dying convulsions. And with
traditional Irish mercy. when
we've got it down we will kick it
into the ground."
