page also derided the welfare

systemas "inadequate" and point-
ed to'the plan in effect in his cum
couhty as a possible alternative.
Under this system, welfare recip-
ients are guaranteed jubs either by
private industry or by the govern-
ment.

He commented that New York
State does not currently “have
adequate resources to support an
open admissions policy However,
he said he would like to see free
tuition in the State University
system. He went on to state that
“administrators and faculty have
got to welcome students in the
formation of policies."

Nickerson supported family
planning in an effort to reduce
population but balked at govern-
ment intervention in limiting fam-
ily size. “There should be family
planning...but I don‘t think set-
ting an arbitrary limit is the way
to do it," he said.

Finally, he declined to as yet
support anyone in the Democratic
senatorial primary. But, when ask-
ed to comment on Paul O'Dwyer,
he said he “was very fond" of
him.

Unique summer program
offers intensive cultural study

by Donna Santora

“Few entering freshmen in
America have the opportunity
which is being offered to our
students, that of beginning the
adventure of higher learning
abroad, learning another language
in its natural setting, experiencing
another culture and seeing life
fresh and whole from a totally
new perspective." This statement,
made by Dean. 0. William Perl-
mutter, is in reference to the
Pre-F‘reshmen Summer Language
Program (P.A.L.P.) which is an
eight week, concentrated, lan—
gringo-studies endeavor, initiated
and sponsored by SUNYA.

The University began this pro-
gram last summer with a group of
thirty students in Germany. The
successful experience of the Ger-
man venturc made it quite evident
that this opportunity should be

Protesters march on Capitol
ask increased aid for poor

by Al Senia

Three thousand demonstrators
from cities across the state con-
verged in front of the State Capi-
tol Building in Albany Wednes-
day. They lobbied for, among
other things, a restoration of
medicaidcuts, an adequate guaran-
teed income for all New Yorkers,
and an end to housing discrimina-
tion.

The demonstrators, black,
white, and Puerto Rican; elderly
and college students, were well-or-
ganized and orderly. The effect
they will have on the lawmakers,
however, will probably at best be
minimal.

The days events began at noon
with a rally in front of the Capi-
tul. Speakers, mainly black and
Puerto Rican, chided the governor
and bcrutcd the legislators for

their indifferent attitudes toward
the poor.

A picket line was then formed.
The signs carried by the demon-
strators read: “Our Children are
Cold; Our Children Are Hungry”
and “Support Human Needs, Not
Military Machines." The best sign
of the day said simply: “No
Ilrtgtm Sufrir Nuestros Ni'rlos.
(Don‘t make our children suffer).

Then the crowd marched slow-
ly up the stone steps to the doors
of the Capitol amid shouts of
“Dump Rocky" and “Power to
the People." As they disappeared
through the revolving doors and
up the steps to the legislative
chambers, shouts of “Bread, Jus-
tice, and Dignity" ﬁlled the air.

Once inside, they found the
doors to the chambers locked and
security heavy. “We want Rocky
NOW,” they yelled.

But the governor, who had
gone to dinner at the Waldorf-
Astoritt the night before, was no-
where to be seen. Ironically, he
was still in New York City where
many of the demonstrators had
come from.

Eventually, the group left the
corridors, the staircases emptied,
tmdthc scene once again ap-
proached normalcy. There was
another small rally outside and
the buses were re-boarded. The
exodus began; the world was again
safe for the Albany power wield-
ers.

The last chants echoed deﬁant-
ly in front of the cold, indifferent
building and were carried through
the crisp winter air until they
came to die against the towers of
the one and one-half billion dollar
South Mall Project which loomed
defiantly, a half a block away.

Education rejoined to life;
General College offers solution

by Julian Matthias

Could you stand living with
your professors? If not, why not?
Why must faculty, administration,
and students be separate and un-
equal? Why can't the academic
community be a glowing world
“indivisiblc with liberty and jus-
tice for "1]?"

A task force of twenty one stuA
dents and two faculty members
decided to chanyc what they did
not like on this campus. Their uns-
wcr was ll “General College."

The General College will be a
community of students and facul-
I.y living logcthcr. it is hoped that
this environman will provide its
members with a total learning ex-
ncrlcncc 2-l hours a day. The idea

behind this arrangement is to offer
an alternative to students who are
not happy with the mode of edu-
cation found on the campus.

Probably the main fault this
group finds and will try to rectify
is the separation of life from edu-
cation. Education should not be
just a preparation for life, but an
integral part of life.

It is hoped that education will
not stop with graduation. If edu-
cation and the desire to learn be-
comes a part of you, then you
won't stop [coming when you
stop classes.

Accordi 1,". to Doug Gold-
schmidt, subjects will be looked at
“wholisticully” so a general over-
view of the matter is learned as
opposed to the traditional method

of “objective analysis," which
breaks the subject into so many
fragments that the student sees
only a “speck of the world."

If this General College becomes
a reality, the members will pick a
topic or project and the entire
group will concern itself with it.
One suggested project is the
“building of a city."

extended to as many incoming
freshmen as possible.

With past success and future
achievement as incentives for con-
tinuation, the summer of 1970
will offer its second annual pro-
gram of intensive language train-
ing for pre-freshmen students in
eight countries-Canada, France,
Germany, Israel, Italy, Portugal,
Puerto Rico and Spain.

P.S.L.P. offers the student an
innovative orientation to Univer-
sity study. It does so by intro-
ducing the student to the stimula-
tion of another way of life and
provides him with the optimum
conditions for learning a foreign
language it) it original habitat.

The progress the student makes
is manifold; for example, P.S.L.P.
could serve as a means of admit-
tunes into advanced language or
literature courses, as an effective
form of preparation for later par-
ticipation in SUNYA's academic
year abroad programs, or simply
as a progressive step in a student's
study of a foreign language.

All newly admitted freshmen
students (minimum age - 18
years), regardless of field of inter—
est are eligible for this program
and are invited to consider what
this opportunity could mean;
transfer students and upper class-
men will also be admitted and are
urged to take full advantage of
this offer as well. Previous aca-
demic achievement is important,
but individual maturity and moti-
vation are even more significant to
selection and success.

Each group of approximately
thirty students will be directed by

Watch ASP for details

a SUNYA staff member who will
serve as a coordinator and advisor.
The programs will be conducted
in a variety of settings and in-
struction will be given by dif-
ferent institutions which meet
SUNYA standards for intensive
language training. _

The institutions will vary from
exclusive language training pro.
grams such as the famous Goethe
Institutein Germany to a specially
arranged course of studies such as
at Laval University in Quebec
City.

The programs Will last approx-
imately 7 to 8 weeks during the
months of July and August Stu-
dents will depart from Kennedy
international Airport at the end
of June and return the ﬁrst week
of September. Before the instruc-
tion commences, there will be a
brief period of travel orientation.

The estimated cost of the pro-
grams will vary from $525 to
$1000, depending largely upon
differences in transportation
charges. The programs in Quebec
and Puerto Rico will be the least
expensive whereas the :cost of the
Israel program will be the most
expensive.

The cost includes transporta-
tion, room, board and tuition.
Personal and incidental expenses
can be as little as $100 if one lives
as a studenl in the country where
one studies which is the most
effective way in which to gain
meaningful experiences.

The credit a student earns will
be established by testing at the
program site and at SUNYA in
September 1970. Normal achieve-
ment will vary from 6 to 11 credit
hours (two to three semester
courses). Beginners in a language
will have the best opportunity for
the greatest amount of growth.
Those studying at intermediate
and advanced levels will have the
advantage of adding refinement to
their ability to write and speak
the language of their choice.

ing PSLP, one should write or

Dean, College of Arts and
