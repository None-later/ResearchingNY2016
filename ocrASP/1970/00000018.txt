tee to End the War in Vietnam.
Out of the two days of frenzied
debate came a uniﬁed front. It
was decided that the week of
April I348 would be the focus
for the Spring anti-war offensive.
It was also decided that on April
IS massive student strikes around
the country would be organized
to drive the message home to
Washington— America should
withdraw immediately from Viet-
nam.

“ People shouldn‘t be so easily mislead by Nixon's
pence overtures. If we remember only as far back as
‘68 we see Nixon following the LB] pattern. He
offers a lot brtt produces very little. Defense
Secretary Laird himself said recently that troop
reductions much below 250,000 would be difficult. “

Surprisingly, the conference
was organized and productive. Un-
like the Students for a Democratic
Society conference last year. the
SMC gathering did not end in
disunity. Instead, most delegates
expressed an awareness about the
need for unity. As one SMC or-
ganizcr said, “We’ve learned
there's little to be gained frorn
in-fighting. Mark Rudd played
that game in ’69 and destroyed
SDS. We aren‘t going to let that
happen here."

Saturday was the first full work
day. Aside from rumors that the
Young Socialist Alliance tried
packing the Steering Committee
meeting with their own people the
previous night, there were few
signs of disharmony. At IO a.m.

lawyer, addressed the delegates in
the Adelbert Gym. He spoke
quickly and forcefully. pointing
out the gains of the anti-war
movement and ending with an
encouraging example of how ef-
fective protest can be: “Let me
assure all of you here today of
one point. LBJ is where he is
today not because Ladybird want-
ed him in Texas but because the
antiAwar movement wanted hrnt
there!"

Following the introductory
speeches. the floor was open to
discussion on agenda and orgarn~
zation. At this point factioner
differences started to emerge. The
Revolutionary Youth Movement
(RYM), for exanrple. wanted SMt‘
to organize itself around other
issues besides Vietnam.

“SMC has failed to unite wnlr
the black organizations and pen.
pic who are almost witlrorrt c\-
ccption against the war" exhorted
one RYM spokesman.

This was countered by a youth'

The first plenary session was
scheduled for 7:30 that night. At
this session ,and at the other two
scheduled for the next day (Sun-
day), a program was hammered
out.

Before the first plenary session
however there were workshops to
attend. The Baker Building, a
block west of the gym, ac-
comodated most of these discus-
sions.

The workshop titlcs read like a
checklist of problems for the 70’s.
Tire Gls and Veterans and the
Fight Against'the War met next to
the Ecology and the Establish-
ment of a National Party work-
shops. Down the hall one could
hear mufﬂed voices from Wo«

burly high school senior. 'Ilrc dis»

position and the opposition pre-

Of course all workshops were
not so orderly. Much hustling de-
veloped over the one-issue stand,
but all in all people talked and
people listened.

STUDENT MOBILIZATION

by William Rohde

Sunday was the important day.
The ﬁrst plenary session, which
met Saturday night, had been long
and loud. RYM pushed hard for
its proposal to combine the black
struggle with the Vietnam issue.
The International Socialists used a
similar tact: they demanded the
inclusion of a broad working-class
catnpaign because “the anti-war
movement must begin to move
against the war machine as a
whole." Women‘s Liberation,
Youth Against War and Facism,
Individuals Against the Crime of
Silence, and seven other groups all
wanted their proposals accepted
also.

YSA stood firm in demanding a
one-issue program. The “multi-
issue morass," as one old—timer
called it, rnrtst be avoided. Carol
Liprnan, National lExecutive Sec-
retary of SMC and a YSA mem-

Tire 1970 SMC conference was
a clear success. Instead of faction-
alization there was unity. Al-
though groups differed on
methods of approach, the major-
ity realized the necessity for tight
organization. That organization
was provided by the decision to
center on one issue.
