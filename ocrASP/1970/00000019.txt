Brignola’s ‘Mixed Bag’ Brings

Jazz to Menand’s Persian Room

by Robert Roseanum

There is exciting music at the
Persian Room in Menands where
the music of Nick Brignola and his
“Mixed Bag," has replaced
dancing with listening. This new
group is one that fuses rock
rhythmic elements and melodies
into the basic concepts of jazz
(improvisation, drive, blues, and
phrasing). Brignola and electric
pianist Don York have a musical
background consisting largely of
jazz whlle bassist Tom Watso, and
drummer Mark Galleo are rock
musicians.

Brignoln is one of the best
baritonists in jazz, an opinion
substantiated by international
Down Bea! critic and popular
polls. It was on baritone sax that
he played the opening number, a
Beatle tune called “Come
Together." He used a tape
attachment for a delayed replay
and never have I heard this device
used more creatively. Avoiding
the pitfall of mimmicry he was
able to truly supplement his music
rather than merely add to it in a
superfluous manner.

The Best Nu tuber

Paying close attention to the
replay. he dueled with it. setting
jup countervlines and interlocking
accents, contrasting and inter-

weaving harmonic lines with start-

ling affect. Don York followed
with u soulful statement that
demonstrated that the electric
piano demands an approach quite
distinct from an ordinary piano.

The next song was an uptempo
bossa nova with a harder driving
piano solo by York, but a dissap-
pointing ﬂute comment by Brig-
nola that lacked direction and self
assurance.

The best number I have heard
in this group's book is “My Fa-
vorite Things." It is played in a
manner which truly highlights the
eclectic direction of this group. It
begins with a slow, mournful flute
statement a capella. Suddenly and
unexpectedly Galleo breaks in
with a powerful and fast rock
beat. Don York sparkles at the
piano, playing furiously, mixing
startling melodic lines with dis-
onant, chilling chords.

Enter Brigaola

Brignola enters on saxello
whining furiously, while spiralling
out of a fire being fanned by
Galleo. who seems sympathetic to
the various moods of his leader,
and by the wild, almost insane
runs by York. Brignola is once
again left alone slashing and jump»
ing, changing tempos constanlly
while occasionally alluding to the
theme. The piano returns fol-
lowed by bass and finally drums.
York and Brignola then dcmon~
strate their skill in avantc gardc
jazz by frantically "battling" one
another. with no sol rhythmic
basis, but in a circular pattern.
The song ends with an attentive
audience cheering madlc. Rarely
has such enthusiasm been generat
ed in a night club audience.

sciously, come to the conclusion

French Club Spends
Cultural Day in NY

by Albert Diner

Le Cercle Francais is becoming
one of the most active foreign
language clubs on campus. It of-
fers French Majors and minors a
conversation hour
week, where they are able to
speak French while enjoying wine
and cheese.

This club recently sponsored
one of its many highlights of the
1969-70 academic year: “A Day
of French Culture in NYC." It
was a well planned event in which
41 students took part. The stu-
dents were abie to see a play by
France's most celebrated Theatre
troupe “La Comedic Francaise,"
which is at present in NYC for a
limited engagement festival of
plays by Moliere. The New York
Times reviewed La Comedic Fran-
caise as “France's most valuable
export-apart from wine."

The students enjoyed the play
“Les Femmes Savantes." Prior to
the trip to NYC, Le Cercle Fran-
cals had the honor of a lecture by
professor H.P. Salomon, who at
present is conducting a seminar on
Moliere. This lecture made the

play more meaningful to those'

students who participated in this
trip.

Alter the play, the students
enjoyed a superb French dinner at
"COQ AU VIN", an stmostpheric,
cozy restaurant with a very good
French provincial cuisine. Again,
Le Cercle Francais is thankful to
M. Salomon for making this din-
ner memorable. Since this dinner
was obtained at a discount price,
it did not include wine. M.Snlo-
mon was shocked when he no-
ticed that the wine was missing.
“What's French food without
wine?“ he asked. He called the
waitress, and at his own expense,
ordered wine for 41 students.

What can possibly top a superb
French dinner? Perhaps nothing
else than ~a concert by Charles
Aznavour, one of France’s most
popular actors, song- writers. and
singers. “Formidable, this Charles

'Aznavour, fantastique, how you

say, outta sight”(WaIl Street Jour-
nal.) And what can top a concert
by Aznavour? Nothing else than a
back-stage meeting with Aznavour
hismelf. The students were
amazed at the “down-to-earth"
attitude of a celebrity of such
status. The club presented Azna-
vour with some souvenirs such as
an Albany State banner, a set of
the new fold-out post cards, and
what else can you give a French-
man than a wine-glass. M. Azna-
vour smiled when he received
the Whiskey-sour glass with Al-
bany State printed on it. He com-
mented that now “at last he's got
something in which to take his
honey in every night.” He signed
autographs for every single stu-
dent. It was really “formidable.”

The only way the French Club
was able to sponsor this trip was
by joining forces with Pi Delta
Phi, the French Honor Society,
which contributed $50. Le Cercle
Francais contributed another $50.
We are thankful to Pi Delta Phi
for helping to make this trip such
a sucCess.

How can Le Cercle Francais top
this trip? It is not easy, but we are
trying. Le Cercle Francais is put-
ting on a play this semester, “La
Valse de Toreadors," by Jenn An-
ouilh, which will be .stngedin late
April. In the planning stages there
is a two-day trip to Montreal , the
second largest French speaking
city in the world. There will be an
evening of modern French songs
at L'alliance Francuise in Schenec-
tady, and a French Pavillion at
State Fair. A Bientot.

Richardson’s ‘Hamlet’ Suﬁers '
From Bad Case of Melaneholyz-

03! Tom Quigley

Tony Richardson’s production
of Shakespeare's HAMLET is a
heavy brew of uneven performan-
ces and ambivalent eechniques
that give the film a strance aura.
The Bard-Of’Avon's famous play
of revenge and social decay has
been filmed in muted color this
time, accentuated by atmospheric
chiaroscuro photography and
lighting, that contrasts the lighter
colors with the oppressive black-
ness of Hamlet‘s physical and
mental states.

Essentially what Richardson
has done is to film the staged
production using sparse settings
which consist mainly of hazy
green-gray brick walls, tunnels,
and chambers to evoke the musty,
confining mood of the play.
Richardson‘s major flaw lies in his
dependence upon the charismatic
performance of Nichol Williamson
in the title role. This is primarily
why the production only partially
succeeds.

Williamson exhibits an arrest-
ing, almost casually bored de-
meanor as the melancholic prince.
Despite his mellifluous command
of Elizabethan language, William-
son does not possess the vocal
power that his two formidable
predecessors, Olivier and Burton,
demonstrated in their versions.
His voice modulates from a weird
nasal whine to a strangled raging
madness that seems strager ab-
surd to the audience. Yet his
soliloquies are brilliant.

Williamson frequently utilized
the excellent device of beginning
the major soliloquics in a pensive
tone of bemused disgust and then
glances directly at the audience as
the camera dollys in for the close-
up. This attempt at inducing in-
timacy between the actor and the
audience reduces the detachment
felt by the audience and thua
Williamson receives their un-
divided attentions as he reveals hia
schemes.

Once again however, director
Richardson turns something ef-
fective into a fault as he treats us
to a whole series of these close
ups. In fact the entire film is one
long examination of eyes, ears,
noses, throats, and blemishes. This
technique is overdone that the
only portion of the actors ana-
tomies we see extend from the
waist up leading one to believe
that these people have no legs or
stand naked from the waist down.

Despite this excessive flaw
Richardson must be credited with
developing some exuberant
scenes, the greatest of which is the
confrontation between Hamlet and
his father's ghost, wherein he
chases the spectre through the
tunnels of the castle into the
recesses of his own mind.

Johnny Winter Tomorrow;

  

We never see the ghost except
as a pool of dazzling light shining
upon Williamson’s face. Yet the
spirit is very real as its eerie,
reverberating electronic voice
echos his command for revenge to
young Hamlet. This is undoubted-
ly the most chilling, macabre
ghost sequence ever devised for a
film version of this play.

The other sequences; the mass
murder finale, the graveyard fight
and the witty exchanges between
Hamlet and -Polonious are high-
lights while the confrontation be-
tween Hamlet and the Queen
mother degenerates into a sloppy,
slobbering interlude of hysterical
incest. ‘

Marianna Faithful is fragile and
pathetic as Ophelia, but the char-
acters basic weakness and final
insanity induced by family hypo-
cracy and court intrigue, is un-
satisfying. Anyone that’a out of it

deserves something better than
the unbelievable drowning aha auf-
fera. Anthony Hopkins as the
usurping murderer, King Claudius,
gives an exceptionally controlled
performance of devine right ar-
rogance. Finally the marvelous
rendering of Polonious as a pa-

tronizing, dirty old lecher is witty

and polished.

This film is obviously intended
to be a showcase for Nichol Wil-
liamson. who has been praised as
one of the greatest of contem-
porary Shakesperian actors. Un-
fortunately due to the sometimes
inspired, sometimes insipid direct-
ion of Tony Richardson what we
seem to get is a sniveling Hamlet
whose melancholy truly gets the
best of his nobility. This has
always been the play's fatal spec-
tre and now this flow haunts this
very unusual film.
