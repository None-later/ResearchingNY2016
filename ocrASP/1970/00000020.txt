Talented Central Connecticut Defeats State 83-77

by Jay Marshall

After battling a taller, talented
Central Connecticut squad even
most of the game, the Albany
State basketball team succumbed
to a secondhalf spurt and dropped
an 83-77 decision to the visiting
Blue Devils last Wednesday night.
In scoring 77 points, State topped
its previous single game high of 76
points against Pratt. Albany was
victimized by Central's superior
board strength, as the visitors
outrebounded on State 45-32.

Central Connecticut was paced
by junior forwards Bill Hunter
and Bill Reaves, who tallied 24
and 19 points respectively.
Reaves averaging 28 points for
the season, was held to four
points in the first half by Al Reid.
After the intermission break, he
broke loose for 15, many on
short jumpers resulting from
offensive rebounds. Hunter was
the .thorn in Albnay’s side all

In League I bowling action this
past week the second place Chop-
pers edged to within only four
points of the league-leading So-
phisticates by winning three of a
possible four big points in the
season's second position week.
Until this last match the Sophisti-
cates, a new team in the league,
had run up a total of 32 points
while losing: only 4. Last year's
champions, the Choppers, are still
in contention for this year‘s
crown as last week’s action saw
them climb well within conquer-
oring range of the league-leaders.
A trophy winner will be decided
from the competition at the lanes
in the remaining four scheduled
matches.

The Sophisticates, who have
been slaughtering the pins all sea-
son long and whose lowest average
bowler is 166, had difﬁculty as
not a single member rolled his
average in the exciting match
bowled this past Tuesday. The
Choppers, who are only 350 pins
below the Sophisticates in total
wood, had a similar problem with
the lanes as none of their bowlers
reached his average either. The
high series of the contest went to
Joseph Hleboski, a 173 average
bowler, who struck a 501 series.

'A New Word on Tenure'

 

 

In November 1969, the Council
on Promotions and Continuing
Appointment under the Univer-
sity Senate submitted a set of
recommendations to change the
Guidelines for Continuing Appoint-
ment and Promotion in the
1970-71 SUNYA Faculty Hand-
book.

Last Monday, after approval by
the Executive Committee, the
members of the University Senate
voted not to accept the recom-
mendations. As this draft has been
sent back to committee we may
review some of the features that
made this proposed policy unique
as well as those aspects that de-
monstrate its shortcomings.

The two influences that helped
develop these recommendations
were suggestions by the Educa-
tional Policies Council and sug-
gestions by the Faculty-Student
Committee on Tenure.

CPCA’s reactions to these two
sets of recommendations formed
the body of change represented in
their recommendations.

The Report of the Faculty-
Student Committee on Tenure de-
fines the tenure system as one
whose purpose is to protect aca-
demic freedom. “Tenure reduces

Central Council last night heard
with surprise the results of the
MYSKANIA Screening Comm-
ittee. The committee nominated
only 14 candidates to fill the 13
positions on MYSKANIA. A two-
thirds vote of the Committee of lb
was required to nominate any of
the 38 juniors that had applied. A
list of criteria for nomination was
set down and apparently closely
followed.

The committee voted on each
individual applicant and no results
of the voting were released until
all voting had taken place. It
wasn’t until after the tally that
the committee found it had only
nominated 14.

The fourteen are: Jan Blumen-
stalk, Ralph DiMarino, Gary Gelt,
Michael Gilbertaon, Mark Goor,
Norma Israel, Sandy Kleinman,

Rosen, Susanna Schweizer, Donna
Simonetti, Carol Tibbets, and

deal with a facet of running a city
or solving an aspect of the urban
crisis. Again, to keep a “whol-
istic" view, the coordination of all
the answers and solutions will be
considered most important to the
persons involved.

This total learning experience
will not prepare a person to be a
doctor, a lawyer, a candlestick
maker, or any other vocation, but
it will make life ll part of the
educational experience and vice
versa.

Right now this program has just
passed the planning stage and is a
proposal being considered in the
Academic Affairs Commission,
from where it may go on to the
University Senate. The General
College strives for a real "iicu~
demic community."

It Is at least it" interesting ex-
periment andI more likely than

to someone's education.

outside groups (such as political,
religious, and military organiza
tions), and protects the faculty
member from the arbitrary or
capricious actions of the adminis-
tration and his colleagues."

“Tenure is also a vote of con-
ﬁdence in the continuing develop-
ment of the individual and is a
judgment that the individual will
ultimately merit promotion to full
professor in competition with
other potential candidates for the
same position from within or
without the University."

The report then discusses the
Relation of tenure to Rank Distri—
bution and the Salary Program.
These external factors cannot be
controlled at our University level,
because the State Budget Ofﬁce
sets the maximum average salary
for each University Center. To
attract and hold the best faculty
the Albany Center would have to
improve its salary rating.

One unusual observation is that
Albany‘s faculty has a higher per-
centage of individuals in the upper
ranks (Associate Professors and
Full Professors) than any of the
three other University centers [Al-
bany 59%, Binghamton 51%, Buf—
falo 51%, StonyBrook 45%]. With
so much room at the top, the
salary scale is somewhat diluted at

l2-4»15 vote. There was some dis«
cussion as to whether or not the
committee was properly repre-
sentative but no course of action
was pursued.

Council also passed two bills.
The first was an appropriation of
$3,445.00 to the Torch to in-
crease the number of yearbooks
available this year to 6,300. This
brings the total Torch budget up
to $26,895 from the original
$l4,975 budgeted to it.

The second bill was a statement
requesting the administration to
take the necessary steps for the
immediate alleviation of Colonial
Quad parking lot problems. These
problems were listed as numerous
holes and craters in the parking

the upper end. The room that is
made for improvement_ is natural-
ly in elimination of those non-
tenured faculty. This has in the
past created uproar: in campus
politics.

An important point to consider
about our faculty is that we have
here a higher than average per-
centage of full professors without
tenure. With 34% of our faculty
standing as full professors (next to
a State University average of 26%)
we have made the attractions of
Albany a little less sparkling.

A reworking of this imbalance
would result in a more attractive
salary scale for all levels. The
granting of tenure would be more
clearly a vote of confidence in
one's evenutual promotion to pro-
fessor, for there would be more
space available in these upper po-
sitions. It is this problem of
balance that merits serious con-
sideration.

The Recommendations of the
Educational Policies Council on
Rank Distribution, Tenure and
Salary supports the specific
"working but not inflexible
model" of holding 40% profes-
sors, 20% associate profs., 30%
assistant profs. and 10% instruc-
tors. “The Council believes that

lot, thefts in the area and accum-
ulated now. The bill stated that
Council felt it was the duty of the
University to provide safe and
adequate parking facilities for its
students.

The following
were also announced:

Terry Wilbert and Steve Jakway
to Athletic Advisory Board;

Allen Rothman to Library
Council;

Bev Cooper to Equal Employ-
ment Committee;

and Steve Brown to Space Man-
agement Committee.

Next week’s Central Council
meeting will again be devoted to
revising the Student Association
Constitution.

this rank distribution not only
brings SUNYA-Albany in line
with‘ the major universities in the
nation, but it also offers the op-
portunity to establish an atmos-
phere that will encourage the best
kinds of faculty to come and
remain at the University. The
40-20-30-10 distribution has the
merit of offering the best junior
members on the faculty an oppor-
tunity for advancement to higher
ranks." This _view demonstrates
the idea of selectivity in refining
the permanent faculty by sifting
and sorting on a competitive basis.

The mean salaries should in-
crease with rank but “there
should be some overlap between
salaries in adjacent ranks." Per-
haps this overlap will become the
balancing factor that will improve
the overall attractiveness of the

University salary schedule--
perhaps not.
CPCA's Recommendations

were particularly directed at a
more precise articulation to the
criteria and procedures in the
system. The three over-all factors
to be considered as criteria for
promotions and continuing ap-
pointments are (1) teaching, (2)
scholarship, (3) other services to
SUNYA or appropriate external
organizations. Under item (2), it is
recommended that the faculty co-
operate in evaluation of teaching

9 by Students and colleagues. This

includes observation of material
and structure quality from all
sides.

The added dimension of stu-
dent participation in course eval-
uation as well as in the considera-

tion of departmental faculty at»
tus should reerilt in an irnproves
ment of the process whereby ten-
ure is granted. CPCA’s recommen-
dation fails to suggest a form of
systematic information that could
be gathered from the students;
according to the Committoe on
Tenure, the consistency of this
systematic reporting is the neces-
sary quality of any effective stu-
dent voice.

The procedure of granting ten-
ure must observe the department's
deﬁnition of its needs in the area
of the individual’s competence.
The reputation of the University
will, in fact, depend on the his-
torv of these appointments.

the target was clear. According to
Baritz, “What prevented Judge
Hoffman from running a fair trial
was his fear that the entire Ameri-
can government was on trial."

What prevented the crowd from
reacting enthusiastically is not a
hard factor to determine. In Bar-

passion but at education and
understanding. “The professor
