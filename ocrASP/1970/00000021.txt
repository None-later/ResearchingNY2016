Students ask control
0 our environment

A request for a moratorium on the alteration of
our natural campus environment was made to the
President at his press conference February I6, 1970.

“Everything in nature is related,” said Edward
Shaw. author of the statement. Such things as the
wanton destruction of trees and underbrush in the
campus lake area can upset the ecology. It is
important that we work with nature and not against
it. because nature will inevitably win in the long

in.
n Shaw does not question the need for expansion
but he does question “the way the university
‘conforms' to its natural environment...Expansion
should be sensitive. We have to show more feeling
for our environment."

Shaw, a student at the University and a member
of PYE Club and Environmental Forum is also
concerned with the architecture of Edward Durell
Stone and its “obscene destruction of that which is
natural."

“We have to recognize that the architect has a
moral responsibility to nature and to society....l
think Stone does not recognize this moral responsi-

' it .” '
bllTiie text of the proposal by Edward Shaw which
was written in consultation with Dr. Long of the
Chemistry Department is as follows:

Man is becoming increasingly aware of the rela-
tionship between himself and his natural environ-
ment; he is beginning to realize the tremendous
complexities that this relationship involves as well as
the awesome consequences that will inevitably
follow if he continues on his present myopic and
self centered course.

Because the University is responsible to society it
must commit itself to the confrontation of the
pressing issues of today. We of the University
community must begin to recognize that the sense-
less destruction of natural assets is taking place here
on our own campus. Even now the quality of the
pond environment is being seriously degraded,
principally owing to the indiscrimate cutting of
trees, both dead and living near the periphery of the
pond, and also to the clearing away of underbush,
which is a favority activity of urban oriented
engineers. (Also not to be overlooked arc the stands
of trees behind the infirmary and to both sides.)

We feel it. is imperative that the University begin
to follow a rational and sensitive course regarding
the alteration of its natural environment, particular-
ly since the University has adopted a role of
leadership with regard to the rest of society. It is
with these thoughts in mind that we propose the
following: the absolute guarantee that no further
cutting of trees or shrubs or plants, or alteration of
drainage. or introduction of new roads, etc. will be
done until a hearing is first held at which Environ-
mental Forum students and professors in addition
to PYE members and other interested parties of the
University community are represented.

We sincerely request this proposal be answered
promptly.

PYE to aid pollution survey

by Tom Clingan

Strange as it may seem on this
campus, PYE club once again had
an excellent turnout Wednesday
evening. According to Erich Wal-
tl'icrs, PYE is already into “stage
two: action." For the first time,
anywhere, a scientific survey of
the amount of air pollution in a
given area will be taken. FiVe
thousand four—inch samples. coat»
ed with silicon oil, will be planted
by the city of Albany. The said
pics, manufactured for this pur-
pose free of chargeI by General
Electric in Schenectady, are to be
cared for by these volunteers in
their backyards for a period of
one month, beginning in April.

Five thousand volunteers will
be needed to do this work, as well
as hundreds of people to distri-
bute and collect the samples.
Volunteers with knowledge in
Chemistry and Biology will be
trained by the Health Department
to accurately measure the amount
of dust sedimentation, lead con-
centration. total sulphur, and ben-
zopyrenc.

It was emphasized at the meet-
ing, and at the specific “task-
force" discussions which follow-
ed, that the main objective of

scientific." The project will con-
stitute most of the scientific half;
the phrase “good, solid data"
came up several times. The direct-
ors of the group. largely graduate
students. have placed heavy em-
phasis on how careful and scien-
tific they are going to be. No data
will be released after the survey is
over until it is carefully checked
and verified. Volunteers will be
keeping track of the visibility all
over the l,256 square mile area.
(Needless to say, people are need-
ed here, too.) The purpose behind
the survey is to show the Gov-
ernment, industry, and the people
of the area just how bad the
present situation is.

Professor Rienow spoke for a
short time about the temporary
defeat of the National Timber
Supply Act. The proponents of
the bill, which would make log-
ging the primary purpose of our
National Forests, had held off on
debate before, hoping by this do-

laying action to dry up criticism.

The bill, HR 12025, is back on
the agenda, due to come up dur-
ing the week of the 22nd. If
President Nixon is worried about
conservation, his Secretary of
Agriculture, Clifton Hardin, is not
-he‘s quite in favor of HR 12025.
All present were asked to write
their congressmen, as soon as pos~
sible. It worked before, it will
again, if all help.

A pre-Teach-ln convention for
New York State will be held on
March 6 and 7 here in Albany.
Local environment groups are
trying to work up a fitting demon—
stration of our awareness of the
problem.

If you’ve read this far into the
story, chances are you're interest-
ed in PYE. If you haven't already
joined, watch for the next meet-
ing. All kinds of talents are need-
ed - so many that everyone is
essential. You don‘t have the
time? In a few years you may
have no time at all.

ALBANY STUDENT

PRESS.

by Aralynn Abare

“That SUNY at Albany estab-
lish a full time infant and child
care center for the children of
students, employees, and faculty"
was the basic demand presented
by the Women‘s Liberation Front
to Vice President 'l‘horne yester-
day.

More specifically, the group re-
quired that “the University be
responsible for providing this in-
fant and child care center, in-
cluding facilities equipment and
staff," but thal a “democratic
representative body of parents.
students and members of Wu-
men's Liberation h:ch final say as

Kuusisto Plans For Ecolog ,
Discusses Residents’ Problems

by Liz Elsesser

At yesterday's press confer-

ence, President Kuusisto outlined

a prospective program regarding

ecology and the university com-

munity. This environmental stu-
dies program would represent our
community in efforts to do some-
thing about cnvironmcntal cor-
ruption. Action has been taken
already to alleviate some pollution
in the lake area caused by actions
of construction workers on Indiiin

Quad. The forum would discuss

this institution as a whole and its

relationship to society.

There was much discussion over
Pres. Kuusisto's remark that class-
room facilities are of greater ini-
piirtancc than lhc trues. “If we
have to become a concrete jungle,
that is what will hiivc to be," he
stated. However. the president al-
so added that this would most
likely not be the case.

In response to a petition sill)-
mitti-d in him his! work from
Edward Shaw of l’Yl‘I chili. lIl('

“Both are escalating too much."

Petitions from over 250 stu
dents were given to the president
in support of Gerry Wagner in
efforts to have his contract re-
newed, The president only rcplied
'that, ‘he will not buck findings of
the Dean.“

Several students questioned the
"raid" bv R.A.'s last Saturday
night in Stuyvesant Tower. It
seems there was ii party going on
which was disrupted when the
elevators were shut off and the
steps barracaded. No one was al-
lowed to leave and those who
tried were allegedly forced

to return. There were two
alleged reasons for the raid: some-

one was sick and the R. A.s

were looking for candles. Pres.
Kuusisto promised immediate in-
vestigation and charges to be
made.

The exact duties and powers of
R.A.'s and dorm directors were
also questioned as well as the
degree of privacy that studean are
entitled to.

The Tower Tribune‘s article
about the Judaic Studies Program
here was discussed and charged as
misinforniatiim. Contrary to IIH.‘
article, the only form of Judaic
Studies Program We have is a
voluntary one sponsored and fi-
nanced by llillcl. A student wants
ed to know why a university that

Despite some discord initiated
by one of the more ‘niilitiint’ of
the seventeen supporters attend-
ing the meeting, an agreement was
reached to have an open meeting
Monday, March 9, 1970, at 3:30

Students Meet
for Wagner

by Brian Moss

ln an action to gain further
support for the student movement
to retain Gerry Wagner on the
faculty of the Department of Rhe-
toric and Public Address, approxi-
mately 50 students questioned
Eugene Nickerson, gubernatorial
candidate. on his opinion of the
student-faculty role in hiring and
firing. Nickcrson agreed although
somewhat half-heartedly, that stu-
dents iind faculty should have the
right to choose their instructors.
