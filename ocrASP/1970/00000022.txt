SUNYACommuterParadise?

Yes, At Least In Comparison

by Beth Babcock

“Though it may not always
seem so. SUNYA is a commuters
paradise - at least in comparison
to other iiniVersities." So says
Beth Babcock. co~President of the
SUNYA Commuter Club. and a
participant in the American Com-
muters Campus Association Con-
ference held this past Monday and
'l'uesday at Wayne State Univer-
sily in Detroit. The conference
was held to discuss those prob-
lems which are considered univer-
sal among the college commuter
population and to formulate a
national policy emphasizing the
role of commuters in today's ur-
ban society.

The problems discussed ranged
from the ordinary. mundane con-
cern with adequate parking to
proposals for such things as stu-
dent lounges for study and in-
creased contact between students.
The conference also set into ino-
tion plans for a national organizir
tioii of commuters sponsoring in-
dependent ehapters on subscribing
college campuses.

According to Miss Babcock.
much of what was discussed was
not relevant to our situation here
at SUNYA, for we do have ade-
(pialc parking facilities and our
study area is quite spacious. How-
ever. the interaction between st u~
ilcnts or the lack thereof - is a
Illtijlll' concern; most of the sill'

dent body - particularly the com-
muters - are isolated from others
and tend to limit their contacts to
a relatively small. relatively closed
group of acquaintences. It is in
this area that the local chapter
feels that they can accomplish the
most. As of yet no definite plans
lnive been formulated. but. steps
are being taken towards setting up
a system which will best represent
commuter interests.

On Monday and Tuesday. Feb.
‘32! and 24. the commuters will be
conducting a survey from which
they hope to gather enough rele-
vant information » somewhat luck-
ing in the past. - to discern the
specific needs and interests of the
2500 students who commute to
classes at. SUNYA. They also plan

to open an office in the Campus
Center. staffed by commuters.
where a commuter can go to find
out about any information rele-
vent to him. such as parking ap-
peals. car pools and the like. Later
in the Spring they intend to spon-
sor a workshop to foster better
understanding with foreign stu-
dents.

In addition to its service activi-
ties. they also intend to sponsor
social activities to give people a
chance to just come together and
get. to know one another.

The SUNYA Commuter Club
thus hopes to influence the stu-
dents to become more active in
both campus and civil affairs. pro-
ducing a less isolated, better
rounded student body.

Students Busted 



“No Knock” Raid .

bV anll Shnnohan

The second floor apartment at
360 Madison Avenue now lies in
shambles. Boards. ripped out of
the wall. lie across the doorway.
Debris clutters every room in the
apartment and a light in the bath-
room has burned now for four
continuous days. Clothes are
everywhere -« thrown on beds
and on the floor. And on the door
is pasted a small peace symbol
with the address of a New Jersey
peace center.

The apartment's condition is
the result of a surprise. “no-
knock" police raid about 9:30
p.m. Thursday night -- a visit by
six detectives and state police in
which five Albany State student
were arrested.

Most press reports indicated
that the arrest was part of a major
effort to stop off-campus drug use
in Albany. However. in an inter-
view. Chief McCurdel. Head of
Police. First Division. the division
which co-ordiiiated the raid re-
fused to say whether or not. this
was true. Nor would he reveal
how many arrests had been made
this year in connection with drug
abuse.

Obviously. however. the police
chief considers the drug traffic to
be quite extensive. At one point
MeCardel blurted: “It’s all over
the place." and immediately ad-
ded that the city notice. are on-
operating with the University po-
lice in their investigations.
SUNYA police, however. took no
part in the Thursday evening raid.

The five students arrested were
arraigned in Police Court on Fri
day and their cases were ad-
journed for one week. At that
time not all had completed lawyer
and hail arrangements. Four of
the five were charged with a fel»
ony: possession of marijuana.

One defeudent was charged
with four other counts as well:
loitering for the purpose of using
drugs. possessing a quantity of
hashisb in his pocket, possessing a
