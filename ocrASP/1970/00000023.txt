 THE ASP‘SPORTS
'Danes Plagued by Frigid
Shooting; Lose 73 - 51

Saturday night, the Albany
State basketball team journeyed
westward to face’a tough Ithaca
team. Although the Red Dragon's
record prior to the game was an
unimpressive 6-11, they had beat-
en Buffalo State (the number
two ranked team in New York
State), and were playing better
ball of late. Last year we defeated
Ithaca at home 73-68.

This year, however, it was a
different story. We jumped out to
a 3-2 lead (the last time we were
ahead in the game). The shooting,
which has been off in many games
this year. was particularly weak in
the first half. We shot 635 (17%)
as compared to lthaca's 16-25
(64%). The comparative field goal
percentages led to a half-time
score of 41-18 in the home team’s
favor. From there on Ithaca coast-
ed to the tune of a twenty point
cushion in beating us 73-51.
Though our shooting was slightly
better in the second half, there
was no way to close the gap that
the taller lthaca team had opened
up in the first half. lncidently, the
Red Dragons, who started five
sophomores, should have ii fine
team in the next two years.

Jack Jordan, the Dane‘s high
scoring forward. netted lil points
to loud us in scoring. Sheelinn and
Reid had II and it) poian re-
spectively. Next year the above

three will be returning along with
Jim Masterson, several transfer
students, some of the varsity re-
serves, and standouts from this
year's highly successful freshman
team. We'll probably be giving
Ithaca good battles for the up-
coming seasons.

The Danes are now 10-8 with
four remaining games. We play at
Buffalo this Wednesday night, fol-

lowed by Utica and Oswego on
the road, winding up the season at
home against Brooklyn College,
march 7. In order to insure that
we don't have our first losing
season under Doc Sauers we need
win only one of these games. It’s
not likely that Doc Sauers will be
losing too much sleep. We ’re look-
ing for the team to wind up 13-9
(wishful thinking?).

Sports

There has been dissatisfaction voiced around this University
concerning our basketball team. Why can’t they win against the
tough schools? Why can’t we get a big man? Why don‘t we play some
of the better colleges in the state like SUC Buffalo, SUC Geneseo and
SUC Brockport? There are answers for these questions. i will attempt
to provide them.

Albany State, Stony Brook, Harpur and Buffalo are the four
university centers of the state system. They have more stringent
admission requirements than the college centers, hence we have
already added another barrier in our quest for better ballplayers.
Besides having ability on the court, they must also show some in the
classroom.

People will now say, however, that UB has powerful teams, that
they play a major university schedule e what is the difference
between U13 and SUNYA? The difference is that UB gives atiicletic
scholarships and we do not. Why? Because they have a scparatc fund,
started when the school was a private university, which allows ihcin to
this financial aid. They receive no money from the state for those
purposes and neither do we. Hence, when a good allielcic with grades
which satisfy the admission standards of both Albany and U of
Buffalo, (or any other scholarship school, for that matter) decides on
a school, where will he choose to go? Not here!

In talking to Dr. Sauers, varsity basketball coach, he stated that
money for partial scholarships could be obtained from various groups
or alumni in the form of donations or from student tax - from the
students‘ pockets. This raises the question of priorities; do we want
to use our money for a better education or a better basketball icair (Iii
seems that our primary reason for being here. however, is to learn. It
is up to the students to choose - no one can tell them what they want.

These are the reasons we can‘t gcl a “big man.“ This is why we
don't beat the tougher schools 7 they either have scholarship
atlielctcs or are able to attract better players because of the schools
lesser academic requirements. Finally. concerning playing iiiughcr
icanis. if we can’t match some of the schools we play now because of
our inferior position, how can we give any thought to hurting our
position more?

In short, there doesn‘t seem to be a very adcquaic solution to this
problem. Students cannot be expected to sacrifice ilicir cducalioiis in
order to pay for :1 better team. The SliIIc won't give money for this.
They can‘t be expected to, either ilicrc are too many oilici'

Plattshurg SwimmersWin

by Harvey Mllllln

The Plattsburg State swimming
team which finished fourth in the
State University of New York
championships last year, had an
easy time in defeating the Albany
swimmers 71-40. The Plattsburg
team set 8 pool recordds during
the meet in the following events:
the 200 yard free-style, the 50 yd
freestyle, the 200 yd. individual
medley, the 200 yd butterﬂy, the
100 yd freestyle. the 200 yd
backstroke, 3 meter diving, and
finally the 400 yd freestyle relay.

Andy McGrorty and Bill Smith
were the only twa Albany swim-
mers to place first in their indivi-
dual events. Andy swam a 5259.2
in the 500 yd freestyle establish-
ing a new varsity record. Sopho-
more Bill Smith, an EOP student,
cashed in for his fifth victory this
year by swimming :1 2139.6 in the
200 yd breaststroke. Besides
working through many hard hours
of training, Bill spends much of
his spare time teach underprivi-
leged children to swim. Freshman
Rich Miller, one of Albany‘s two
divers, set a 3 meter varsity diving
record by becoming the first Stat-e
diver to ever place in this event.
Pete Gersten Haber, who last
week extablished a State record in

the 400 yd individual medley, set
another varsity record by turning
in a 2:24.7 for the 200 yd butter-

y.

This past weekend saw a full
schedule of AMIA competition. In
League I action the Brothers I
continued to dominate their op-
position defeating APA 70-32.
Troy Moss tallied 18 points for
the victors while Bill Motto scored
13 for APA. UFS I improved their
chances of obtaining a playoff
birth with a 50-47 win over the
third place Bruins. UFS also
picked up a forfeit from STB Ias
did APA It appears as if STD I
has dropped out of League I
competition.

Potter Club remained on the
heels of the Brothers pulling out a
close 41-40 decision OVer UFS.
The playoffs will probably see
these teams battling in the first
round, as Potter is in second place
and UFS is in fourth. The Bro-
thers appear destined for playoff
competition against the third
place Bruins.
