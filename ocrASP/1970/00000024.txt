The Times and the ‘Dutiful

Transmission of Military Lies’

SAIGON, South Vietnam--
(CPS)--American troops caught a
North Vietnamese force in a pin-
cer movement in the central coast
plain yesterday, killing 128 enemy
soldiers in daylong fighting. «New
York Times, March 17,1968, p.1.

Military Lies

(CPS)--Sound like the usual
day-to-day news report we read
about Vietnam? Sure-only this
particular pack of military lies~
dutifully transmitted to the
American people by the New
Yorlr Times and the rest of the
news media-backﬁred a year-
,and-a-half later when it was re-
vealed the dead were not “enemy
soldiers," but unarmed civilians,
including many women and chil-
dren, massacred at My Lai.

Media Beluddlement

What about the many Vietnam
news stories and broadcasts we are
fed every day‘.’ Are they any more
truthful or accurate than last
year's Times story of March 17'?
Of course not. The media have
continually distorted reports by
their own correspondents which
reveal the true nature of the Viet-
nam war by incorporating Penta-
gon euphemisms and Administra~
tion rhetoric. They continually
befuddle the reader in his search
for objectivity by reconciling lan-
guage and style with U.S. foreign
policy assumptions and propagan-
da.

Politics and Distortion

Political necessities in America
distort what we read, Big news-
papers have two considerations
on the one hand, it” they want to
maintain their precious contacts
inside the government and the big
political machines as well as their
advertising revenue, they cannot.
offend big government or corpor-
ate interests; on the other hand, if
they are to maintain any crcdibili~
ty with a public that wants the
war ended, they have to report in
a way that at least suggests they
are independent and in touch with
America‘s failure in Vietnam.

New York Media Proiect

All of these problems create
reporting on the war that is full of
inconsistencies, absurdities, dis
tortions and outright lies. But
there are patterns in the murk,
patterns dictated by the kind of

economic and political power that
defines the establishment press.
The reporting is inconsistent, but
it is inconsistent around particular
issues; there are lies, but the lies
are all in the same direction, all
aimed at establishing certain be-
liefs among the public.

Therefore, so that we might all
more readily pierce mass media
obfuscation, New York Media
Project offers this quick, com-
parative glossary of what gets
printed and how to decipher it.

Death Coverage

As the My Lai
massacre recently demonstrated,
enemy soldiers" in the press are
not always enemy soldiers in fact.
Always quick to pick up on U.S.
Army press releases, the mass
media have all too often given
credence to the official lie that we
are merely fighting the “Viet-
cong,” and not also murdering
defenseless civilians. In other
words, there is a tendency to call
any dead Vietnamese a “Viet-
Cong." They have also cooperated
in encouraging the “body count"
psychology that reduces human
beings to things to be eliminated
once they have been classified as
ureds" or "Vietcong."

"Light casualties"

It is noteworthy that "enemy"
deaths as a matter of course are
given more play than American
deaths. In the war game where, as
US. policy officials have empha~
sized, enemy body counts tell us
We‘re winning, the media does not
very prominently display our op~
ponent's score, News reports con-
sistently bury the number of
Americans killed in the body of
the story, and frequently say no
more than “American custlnllics
were described as light 

Group Identification
One
would assume that an objective
media would use the title or name
each military or political organiza-
tion as officially adopted by that
group. Typically, however. they
do not. The name of the South
Vietnamese revolutionary forces,
National Liberation Front, could
hardly bc excluded from the US.

bureau. Instead the media have
adopted the term “Vietcong,”
coined unofficially by the Saigon
milirary junta. There is in fact no
such thing as the Vietcong-the
word is Vietnamese slang for
“Vietnamese Communists."

At the same time, the media
have cleverly conveyed the im-
pression that the so-called Viet-
cong are North Vietnamese infil-
trators rather than a South Viet-
namese political organization.
How many Americans realize that
the “Vietcong” are native South
Vietnamese? For that matter, how
many Americans know that the
two “South Vietnamese leaders,"
General Thieu and Air Marshall
Ky, were not born in North Vietv
nam and fought with French for-

‘I‘IJIIDAY. "IUMY 36, I970 \LBANY STUDENT PRESS

 

by mtchaol union 8: dlonl dllloy
Few people under fifty years of
qe have seen any of Charles
Chaplan's later feature films, The
reason for this is that Chaplan still
owns the rights to all the films he
himself produced except Tire
Gold Rush. (Chaplan lost the
rights to this film in a messy
divorce case.)

Thus Chaplan’s reputation with
this generation is based mostly on
his early Keystone, Mutual and
Essanay shorts. This does the man
a great disservice. These early
films, especially the Keystones,
are often poorly made and rely
mostly on slapstick for their hu—
mor.

Clmplﬂﬂ's ingenious humor
and pathos was not fully devel-
oped until he started to produce
his own films. There is, however,
some evidence that Chaplan's
heretofor unuvaialable roaster-

‘The‘. Circus’ "Relcintﬂcs
the Magic Umphn Charm

Mr. Chaplan, now 80 years old,
wrote a new simple and sensitive
score, but other than that the film
is exactly the same as when it was
first shown in 1929.

The film opens with amedium
closeup of a young lady on a
trapeze. This is kind of a prologue
and serves only as visual accom-
paniment for the sound track
which has the 80 year old Chaplan
singing her advice. Only after this
wonderfully touching song does
the story unfurl.

As the title suggests the story
concerns a circus which is, of
course, not doing too well. Chap-
lan, playing his famous tramp,
wreaks havoc on the circus in a
hilarously disastrous episode. As
fate would hrive it Chuplan's
bumbling leads him to the center
ring as a clown. The circus starts
drawing huge crowds, however,

being taken advantage of until a
girl, who is the daughter of the
circus owner, comes to his aid.

The Tramp falls in love with
the girl and is led to believe she
loves him when he overhears a
gypsy tell her fortune. However,
the dank, handsome man men-
tioned turns out to be the new
tightrope walker.

It is nearly impossible to de-
scribe the gags in this film because
most of the humor is derived from
the actions and facial expressions
that only Chaplan could bring off.

All in all this film is a forgotten
masterpiece. It contains the most
powerfully pathetic sequence I‘ve
ever seen. After the girl has mar-
ried the high wire artist, the circus
leaves town, without the Tramp.
Finally all that remains are Chap-
Ian and a tattered piece of a circus
poster showing only a star. Cham‘

ese and Algerian nationalists?
The Spy Game

You might take
note of the media's consistency in
referring to U.S. spies as “intelli-
gence agents," and NLF intelli-
gence agents as “Vietcong spies."

In the tradition of their
"spy" terminology, the media ap-
pear to be confused about the
meaning of the word “terrorists.”
A saboteur, us we all know from
Messrs. Wayne, Mitchum, Peck
and Lancaster, destroys property
and not people. He is a hero to
the people he serves, Nonetheless,
news reports are always making
statements like “Vietcong terror-
sts blew up a bridge today," and
“Allied saboteurs successfully in-
ﬁltrated enemy lines today, de-
stroying an enemy fortress and
killing twelve of its occupants."
This glossary is intended as
only a brief illustration of how
the media collaborate with U.S.
officialdom to blur the distinction
between fact and governmental/
military propaganda. The mass
media print and broadcast 98% of
the l’cnlugon's news releases, but
how often do you see news re-
leases from the NLF or DRV‘.’
Press restrictions
How many journalists can get
the money necessary to do the
kind of investigative reporting
that blew the lid off Songmy'.’
How many people know that
news reporters and writers are
restricted by their organization's
style and content guidelines-41ml,
for example, the luau who writes
a story has no choice as to whe-
thcr he uses the term “NLF” or
“Vietcong”?
Censorship
it is on the higher lcvclsvin the
carpeted offices of tlic men who
own and manage the media--lhal.
such decisions are made. And
when the media censors itself. it
censors "objectivity" out of cxis'
tencc.

Johnny Winter in Concert
Delivers Hard, Fast Blues

by Alan Lasker

The Winter Formula: Plenty of
room to move about, music heavy
and electrifying with a back-
ground of bass and rhythm guitar
and drums and a foregrouan of
solo instruments and wailing
voices. His powerful personal tal-
ent will do the rest. Winter never
stands still; gliding and dancing
across the platform he creates a
sensation that only a gutsy blues
singer and guitarist could manage.

"Rig," the evening’s first mode
of entertainment was true to the
new trend of contemporary mu-
sic, combining old rock and blues
elements. Guitar, drums, and voi-
ces coordinated to produce a bar—
monizing effect, which although it
provided for easy listening, failed
to generate any degree of em‘
pathy. It is notable that their
number, “Please Stick Around,"
was dedicated to Gerry Wagner.
the dismissed RPA profeessor. Un-
fortunately their music was not as
notable, merely serving as a time
killer for Johnny Winter to make
ready his appearance.

During intermission, a poorly
self-styled Bob Dylan prunced up
on stage and flaunted hismclf in a
pitiful attempt to excite the audi-
encc. The impatient spectators
made it rather clear that no freak
show would substitute for outer
tainmcnt. In defense of this flop,
all one can say is, it takes
chutzpab.

Thankfully the lights dimmed
anti Johnny Winter ascended the
platform. Whirl was at first an
undercurrent of hand clapping
turned into monstrous din. liobcd

Johnny felt the vibrations from
the audience and acted upon
them. Excitement grew propor-
tionately each time he wailed and
move about stage,

"Tobbacco Road“ was magnifi-
cent. The sycbronization of the
saxophone, the organ, and the
guitar coupled with feverish drum
rolls made this Johnny's most

exciting piece. “Johnny Be Good"
literally brought about a hand
clapping, wild screaming fervor
that probably could have been
heard as far as State Quad.

Johnny and Company proved
more than competent as they
played the gassiest and hardest
blues...blues as they were meant
to be played.

MEV Concert Features
‘Bring Your Own 9

by Warren Burt

Musica Ellettronica Viva, a six
man electronic improvisation
group, from Rome, ltaly, will
appear here on Saturday night,
Feb. 28th at 8:30pm in the Ex
perimental Theatre of the Per-
lorining Arts Center.

The group consists of compos-
ers Frederick, Rzewski, Richard
Titlebaom and Alvin Curran, art»
ists Nicolle Abelloos and Edith
Schloss, and harmonica virtuoso
Barbara Mayfield, But categori-
zing such as this becomes irrele-
vant when confronted with a
group like MEV. For each mem-
ber, in the end, becomes a sound
generator subservient to the pro-
ccsscs of the whole group.

The process is improvisation,
and the means are any sounds that
linppcn to be available ill. the
moment, from tin cans to Moog
synthesizers. The improvisations
arc based, to quote group lcadcr
ltzcwski, “neither on pro-deter
nincd structures or chance, but

mutual friendship and trust."

One such piece, to be performed
this Saturday. is “Sticks” by
Christian Wolff, whose score reads
in part, “Make sounds of sticks,
with sticks, and on instruments-
try not to start fires,"

Another piece, “Free Soup" or
“Sound Pool," explores the possiA
bilities of the use of the audience
as an insturment, Each member of
the audience is requested to bring
a small sound, preferably soft in
nature. The piece then consists of
improvisation by MEV and the
audience which is fed into sound
systems.

What comes out if often jum»
blcd, amazing, weird, raucous,
complex, simple, wild and always
beautiful. This mixture is [her
brought to a.boil and let simmer
for an indeterminate lime length,
the only limits in performance
being on the performers them-
selves.

The concert will be free with
Student Tax, $2.00 for Faculty
and $3.00 for Patrons, and is
sponsored by Music Council.
