FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1970

Complainers take note:
Bookstore Explained 7.

Complaints about the State
University Bookstore have not de-
creased with the onset of the sec-
ond semester. To many students.
lack of books was at an all time
high. To better acquaint the Uni-
versity community with the prob-
lems that face them, the Book-
store bas explained its procedures
and the difficulties which occur.

Textbook buying is a year-
-round process, not restricted to
those two weeks or so when book-
lines stretch beneath the Physics
Building. The textbook depart-
ment orders, receives, and double-
-checks large book shipments for
the Fall, Spring and Summer se-
mesters, an operation exacting
both full and part-time help.

Generally two months before
the new term. book orders are due
in the department. However, it is
stressed that the correct orders are
requested, a great demand consid~
ering the usual problems which
occur.

However, even if a completely
accurate list is furnished, the pub-

own time as they see fit; there-
fore, anyone could serve on
Council regardless of his
cumulative average because that is
a personal affair and not that of
the Council.

Norm Rich proposed an
amendment which, in effect,
deletes the clause from the
Constitution that living areas
should be the basis of Council
representation. and puts it in the
by-lawa. Dave Neufeld argued in
support of Rich’s amendment and
Joe Kaiser and Ken Stokem led
the debate against Rich's
amendment. Norm Rich's reason
for the proposal was that a
constitutional amendment can be
less easily changed than a by-Iaw;
therefore, to insure some freedom
of action by the Council, this
would have had to have been
deleted. The opposition
maintained that a block of voters
(fraternities, for example) could
dominate the election and insure
all fraternity candidates as victors.
The amendment was passed

lisher may not be able to ship
promptly, thus causing further
complications in the bookstore.

Freight strikes, driver strikes, or
unexpected enrollments can also
be encountered, resulting in
delays for the bookstore as well al
for the student.

Adequate storage is probably
one of the greatest difficulties
faced, Estimated enrollments pre-
pared by professors are often too
high, resulting in a surplus of text.
Excess books have to be returned
to the publisher, tying up book~
store staff in their re-packaging.
This also cuts efficiency in the dis-
tribution of books to students.

In order to prevent such prob-
lems. as well as to prevent such
problems, as well as to conserve
space, the personnel of the book-
store study previous enrollments
with regard to whether the books
have been used before, and
whether it will be used again.
These factors are studied before a
text is ordered.

As in most businesses, there is
never enough staff. Extra help
cannot be brought in to cope with
the flood of work accumulating
just before the beginning of the
semester rush because this re-
quires trained personnel. Famil-
iarity with the system, special pro-
cedures, and research problems
come with experience.

The textbook department also
is forced to concern itself with or-
dering books for professors and
special projects as well as ordering
for regular courses.

Dr. Hamilton
Continued from page I

Hamilton, in his open letter to
Corning, went on:

“The black community of Al‘
bany does not need you to pro-
claim Martin Luthcr King Day. It
needs the snow and trash removed
from South Pearl Street...because
snow is still three feet deep on the
sidewalk seven weeks after the
snow came."

“The black community does
not need you to proclaim Negro
History Week. It needs to have
you stop controlling the school
board, and bavo an elected board
that will be responsive to the
people."

"The black community does
not want to hear you talk about
‘letl.ing justice take its course'
rather than having the charges
dropped against student:- ut Al-
bany High School."

Hamilton then concluded:
“...Mr. Mayor, we need less con-
trol, less manipulation, less gram]-
sl.an(ling, and more action. We
honor Mr. Burns and will work
with him. But we will not perform
at your circus-cs."

Burns is replacing John E.
Brown, who is white, as manager
of the controversial Thacher
Homes. The housing units havo
drawn fire from black official who
deemed conditions at the project
"horrible."

    

Among other things the State University Bookstore is expected to supply the University communlty ﬁlth

books.

Move to Lower Votin

Age

Takes a Small Step Forward

by Al Sonic

The long process in lowering
the New York State voting age
took a small step forward this
week when the Senate and As-
sembly passed two different ver-
sions of a bill to decrease the
voting age to eighteen.

First, the Senate voted, 511 to 3,
to make the change effective in
just a single step. Under this plan,
18 year olds would get the vote
by 1972.

But the Assembly did not con«
cur. They defeated the same mea-
sure, introduced by Eli Wager of
Mineola, L.I., 78 to 71. Instead,
they chose to enfranchise 18 year
olds in a more complicated three-
step procedure.

If this plan is finally adopted,
the voting age would drop down
one year every six years, subject
to approval in a voter referendum.
In other words, 18 year olds
would get the vote in ltii‘lti-‘if this
measure is adopted.

Buffalo

Continued from page 1
Norton Hall was sealed off and a
high level administration meeting
was called.

That was the situation leading
to yesterday's violence and to-
day's student shutdown.

And the leader of the black slu'
dents-whose demands helped lead
to the initial confrontation-—was
reportedly annoyed at the admin-
istration for violating the agree-
ment not to hold any basketball
games until the demands were
negotiated. Thursday morning,
under heavy police guard, Buffalo
beat Albany State, 70-59.

Why the impasse? The Assem-
bly approved bill was the more
gradual approach and was more
palatable to conservative Republi-
can lawmakers in the Assembly.
They argued that although they
approved of the one~step measure,
it was certain to be defeated in a
public referendum. (Amendments
must be passed by two separate
legislatures and a referendum to

by Judy Novicky

The New Democratic Coalition
met Wednesday night for the pur‘
pose of endorsing candidates for
the coming State elections. In
order for a candidate to receive
the endorsement, it was decided
that he must receive over 50% of
the vote.

The senatorial candidates were
considered first and after brief
discussion I’nul O'Dwyer won the
endorsement over Richard
McCarthy, Richard Ottinger, Ben
Rosenthal, and Theodore Soren-
SUI].

In discussion, several members
criticized Sorenson for his stand

become law.) And such a defeat in
a referendum, the argument con-
tinued, would bury the issue for a
decade or two.

But the lDemocrat told a dif-
ferent story, They claimed the
impasse was a deliberate ploy by
the Republicans (who control
both houses of the Legislature) to
kill any action at all on the 18

year old vote.

Election Endorsements

on Vietnam and his support of
Nixon's nomination of Hayns-
Worth to the Supreme Court
There was no endorsement for
governor since no candidate re-
ceived the required 51% of the
vote. After brief debate centering

around Eugene Nickerson and

Howard Samuels, the vote ended
with eight for Samuels, eight for
Nickerson, and two for vanden-
Heuell. Craig Baumgarten, a mem-
ber of Howard Samuels‘ staff,
spoke briefly for Samuels. .

From several candidates con-
tending for the nomination for
Attorney General, Adam Walinsky
received the group's endorsement.
