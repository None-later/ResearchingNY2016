Elections
To the Editor;

When five out of six candidates
for freshman class president are
students living on the downtown
campus, and when the sixth is the
only informed member from an
extremely huge uptown enrollment
of freshmen; then, i suggest ample
coverage was not given to the
upcoming class elections. I suggest
those empowered to control the
elections offer extensions to the
seemingly vestigial nomination
deadline. They should put down

their unwarranted. irresponsible
defense of "Those interested
.

'would have known," and enter-

tain the factual realization that
htis is not so. I am interested and
Idid not know!

I am left now with no recourse
except to suffer the definite
handicap of a write-in candidate.
General consensus affirms that
the election comes as a surprise.

but still, the election commission
offers no compromise, no retreat,
no fair answer. Whereby the ex-
tension of the nomination dead-
line could serve no undue hard-
ship on any candidate, and no
other ramifications except for the
creation of a fairer election, l
suggest an extension. I write to
those in control not out of sour
grapes. but out of the earnest
desire for review in this matter,
and to see a just and adequate
solution.

Hopefully.

Gentlemen, the word fuck has
been around for along time. Far
longer than the ASP. For a thou-
sand years or more it has been
serving Englishmen and Americans
admirably in times of sudden pain
and smoldering anger. There are
those who even suggest it is a
historical base for the present
Western love of acronym, being an
abbreviation for “F‘ornicate! Un‘
der Command of the King." The
suggestion, spread largely by Scots
mid lrishmeii, is that the ancestors
of the English lacked even the
initiative to engage in sexual inter-
course, but had to be ordered to
do so by the King. Who, the story
goes, was by no means adverse.
being - well» a heartily curious
fellow. Now Parliament has ne-
glected to take this power away
from the monarchs, and should
ever a king with a keen(and
strong) sense of humor accede to
the throne, one can imagine a far
finer hour for the little island than
the Battle of Britain.

In any case, there is a queen in
England at this writing. So the
proper spelling is not fuck, but
rather fucque, So if you gentle-
men are apprehensive or nervous
at using fuck, then use the pre-
sently correct spelling fucque. For
who could object to a word that
falls on our eyes with such French
grace and elegance?

But please. don't write things
like. “who gives a l'---‘?". or “—---
off." It is so gothic aan hypocriti-
cal to us. spellings like that. There
is nothing wrong with fuck but
bad wriling Those who have
lward lhc work before will not be
offended. Those who have not
will be grateful for the new ad-
dition to [heir vocabulary. Fuck is
an old and even sacred word (in
an obscene way). It deserves bet~
for than truncalion,

“Hail hero, hail household word!"
It was now 11 o'clock in the

everyone to be going to bed. A
ship appeared on the celestial
horizon. Dig it! It was time for
lunch and SUNYA closed for the

causing an earthquake that top-

Rockefeller declared a state of

were restless, especially as they
were expecting a deferment. The
cleaning lady was snoring as mil-
lions of New Yorkers demonstrat-
ed at Gracie Mansion for the
return of Long Island. Mayor
Lindsay said, "Shit!" Right on!

The headlines screamed: "To-
day Long Island, tomorrow the
world." The Cold Spring Harbor
Fish Hatcheries left to visit the
Walt Whitman House now fea-
tured off Madagascar. Millions of
Italians were stranded in America
shouting “MANGEPANE-
PROUS," as they gazed out over
the waters of empty Long Island
Sound. It was now 11:02 a.m.,
and people were still going to
sleep.

Back at SUNYA everything was
in a shambles. “Where are you,
Edward Durrell Stone?” cried the
Virgins of Virginia who ran a
charity home for wayward young
men. Moustache. The Williamson
appled orchards switched to
oranges and business was ruined
for lack of consumers. So were
the churches for lack of sinners.

Meanwhile, Mary Leakey, rum-
maging around in the Olduvai
Gorge, discovered a new fossil
head, which she named homo
superior Long lslandis. Bayard
Rustin ruminutcd: “A new
climate is settling over Germany."
Two dogs fled to Canada as their
draft numbers came up.

Nixon got on TV again at
1l:03 am. and pleaded, “Come
back Long Island! The douches of
this country need you, and so
does SUNYA!" Foreign aid was
sent by Red China to SUNYA and
the school was rebuilt of balsa
wood.

Meanwhile Long Island was ac-
cepting a lucrative offer by Mada-
gascar to remain as an authentic
tourist attraction for the rest of
the tourist season, It was now
11:04 am. and the cleaning lady
was snoring.

Student participation all all levels of the university com-

munity, especially

at the departmental level, is essential

if there is to be any hope that classroom education will
one day be relevant to the strident. Implicit in the concept
of student participation is student power.

Last May, Dr. Evan Collins, then President of SUNY
Albany, issued a statement reiterating the university's
“commitment to lllC principle of student participation in
academic affairs." What has happened in the following
nine months? To what extent is there meaningful strident
participation“? To what cxlcntl do students have any voice.

any power?

The Senate was asked lo draw up guidelines for faculty-
studcnt consultation last May to insure the implementa-
tion of strident participation. These were finally approved
by Senate in their lasl meeting. Now the responsibility has
shifted to the individual dcparlnicnls (both the students

and the faculty).

lhulcr these guidelines each department is requich to
file a slutsmcnl of compliance Willi lhc Vicc-(‘hziiiniun of

PYE

To the editor:

Below is a copy of a lelter I
sent to President Nixon. “0'”
never read it. But if the students
of this University support my
points, perhaps they will crawl
from their shells of apathy. join
PYE. and participate in our rally
in April. It will be much more
effective than any letter.

I am a member of the PYE
(Protect Your Environment) Club
at the State University of New
York at Albany.

I have, therefore, become most
distressed about the apparent
paradox in your stand on Conscr-
vation and Pollution.

In your State of the Union
message you stated that pollution
is our foremost challenge for the
coming decade.

The articles on pollution in

Pollution goes hand in hand
with conservation, It seems to me
that you cannot take up one issue
and ignore the other. Yet during
the week of February 22, the
National Timber Supply Act, no.
“R 12025, an act that will permit
the wholesale destruction of
Woodlends, is coming up before
Congress. More trees would be cut
than we have the power to reple-
nish. I am ardently opposed to
this bill and I would like to find
some reason why anyone would
vote for it, I strongly urge the
defeat of this bill.

Last night Mr. Eugene Nicker-
son gave his initial campaign
speech in the New York State
gubernatorial race, here at Al-
bany. In answer to someone who
asked him if he would use any
means to reach a certain end, he
replied, "No, I will not resort to
violence.” He said he still hail
faith in our political machine.

Americans today are quickly

llllll'llllli‘ that takes six years to
strip one company (of many) that
pours millions of tons of gunk
into this nation‘s rivers annually"

"A society that takes from mi

Please answer my plea; if not

personally, then through the

Dear Editor:

On Tuesday, February 24,
while in the lobby of the Campus
Center, ll male students called me
over to their table and tried to
convince me to sign ii petition for
the reinstatement of a Mr. Gerry
Wagner. I am a transfer student
and I don't know the man nor am
I familiar with the circumstances
which lead to his dismissal.

I tried to explain this to these
three "gentlemen" but one of
them got excited and accused me
of being apathetic to the problems
of the student. However, this peti‘
lion was solely for the reinstate-
mcnl of a former faculty member
it (lid not ask for the endorsement
of those who favored strident
choice of faculty When I finally
rcfuscd to sign hi: petition he
threw up his middle finger in
disgust. l was so flubbergasted and
embarrassed I didn't know what
to say.

Mr. Editor, must we "con-
cerned" students be the victims of
these rip-tight and obviously im-
mature "conscientious object-
ors"? II' he hadn't been so crude
and so "uncrmcerned" about my
feelings. i probably would have
been moved by his commitment
to his cause and signed his peti-
lion.

Sincerely.
Thea Gentile
