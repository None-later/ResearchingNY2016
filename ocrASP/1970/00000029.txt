Seven Hundred Demand:

‘What About The

by Martha Nethenson

“What about the gym?" was
the big question at this week's
presidential press conference, as
all other school matters were put
aside. The crowd filed from the
Patroon lounge to the Assembly
Hall and finally to the Ballroom.
The number of persons attending
seemed to increase with every
move and soon totaled 600 or
700.

Dr. Clifton Thorne, Vice-
President of Student Affairs. held
the press conference in place of
President Kuusisto, who is, ironi-
cally, attending a meeting in Chi-
cago.

The entire issue involves the vis-
it of William Kunstlcr lawyer of
the Chicago Seven, to our campus.
lie was scheduled to speak here
last Thursday, but cancelled it for
reasons of “fatigue and legal re-
sponsibilities." Kunstler is now
expected to speak this coming
Thursday, March f), at eight
o'clock. The SUNYA gym is the
only place on campus large
enough to hold the anticipated
audience. On that night, however,
intramural Basketball games have

already been scheduled for that
time. The students have requested
Coach Harold Bell to reschedule
these games and allow the gym to
be used for the scheduled speaker,
but Coach Bell refused.

Dean Thorne feels that since
these are two student activities,
the matter should be discussed be-
tween the two groups and the stu-
dents should come to a decision.
He suggested several times that
the matter might be taken before
the Central Council. One angry
student accused Thorne of not
caring whether Kunstler comes or
goes to jail, but the students do.
He received a big hand and Thorne
said he wouldn’t debate that.

The intramural Basketball
games are supported by the Stu-
dent Activities Asseasment, and
take place several times a week._
Spectators, it should be noted, are
not permitted. Student represen-
tatives of the basketball teams
stated that their teams would not
play on Thursday night. Some stu-
dents were at'raid that even if the
games were cancelled. Bell
wouldn't allow thc gym to be
used, but Dean Thorne said, in
such a case, the Administration
would step in.

Kunstler to appear

Thursday

William M. Kunstler, Chief
Counsel for the defense in the
Chicago H Conspiracy Trial will
speak at the Albany State Canr
pus, Thursday evening at 8:00
pm.
Kunstlcr will definitely speak
but the location of the rally has
just been clarified. The gym is the
only building capable of holding
the thousands of people expected
to attend but was being used by
the intra-mural basketball tennis.

The demands of the 700 stu-
dents present at the press conifer-
ence resulted in the release of a
statement by Dean Sorrell Chesin:

"We have been informed by the

° C '
m m.
Vice Presidents/of the AMlA,
George Turo, that the intramural
playoffs will be postponed. As a
result the gymnasium will be avail-
able on Thursday evening for
scheduling Mr. Kunstler‘s appear»
unce."

University students will be ad-
mitted to the gym at 7:00. ID
cards are required. At 7:30 the
doors will he opened for the gen-
eral public.

No outside security has been
obtained. SUNY police will direct
traffic outside the gym. Howover,
no uniformed police will be in the
building. The New Left Organ-
izing Committee will provide mar-
shaila during the speech.

Gym?’

The students petitioned Dean
Thorne to call Bell and make him
aware of the situation, One stu-
dent attempted to call Coach Bell
during the meeting. but he re—
ported that a "scared" secretary
said he wasn't in.

Team representatives met with
Thorne and he took their names.
All but two teams were represent-
ed. The rest of the students dc-
cided to stay in the Ballroom until
the issue was settled. it was then
announced that there were also
volleyball games that night, but
they were quickly cancelled.

At the end of the conference.
the matter was still up in the air,
but Dean Thorne would investi-
gate and discuss it with the Coach.
The students left with the feeling
that the gym would he theirs in
any case.

" Kunstler’s
‘ Arouses UniverSIty

by Neill Shanahan

“Bill Kunsticr may soon be in
oil and that doesn‘t mean a damn
'0 you but to us it does!"

John Kaufman, New Left 0r-
ganizing Committee In Dr. Clifton
'I‘home at Monday '.~; press confer-
ence.

“The place he should be right
now is in jail. "

Strong, angry but opposing
pressures were exerted on the ad-
ministration late iast week and
yesterday either to cancel William
Kunstler's speech or to authorize
the use of the university's largest
facility for the event, the gym-
nasium.

Approximately 700 students,
ﬁlling three‘quartern of the ball-
room confronted Dr. Clifton
Thorne at yesterday's conference
with the demand that he exercise
administrative "fiat" and free the
rym.
On the other hand, citing the
violent demonstrations in Santa
Barbara, California, which fol-
lowed a Kunstler speech, Assem-
blyman Neil Kellcher telephoned
Dr. Charles O’Reilly, vice-presi-
dent, with the demand that the
speech be cancelled altogether.
Kelieher is the sponsor of a pro-
posal to dismiss teachers who re-
fuse to pledge allegiance to the
flag in classroom ceremonies.

While Dr. O'Reiliy reaffirmed
the right of Kunstler to speak, ad-
ministrative officials seriously
hesitated to free the gym.

“So far as we are concerned
Mr.Kunstler is a man with a point
of view invited by a student group
to speak on campus. The policy of
the Board of Trustees is very clear
and we will adhere to it."

What was not clear however,
was the attitude of the administra-
tion to the visit. “The institution
does not believe it should be
handled by administrative fiat"
said Dr. Thorne.

"What you have to do is tell
Bell (Harold Bell, AMIA Director)
to reschelule that goddai‘nn
game!“ countered his opposition.

The rising tension came at a
time when radical activity has
been increasing throughout the
nation - much of it connected
with the Chicago Conspiracy trial.
.Viajor demonstrations and violent
confrontations occurred last; week
in Washington DC (Watergate),
Chicago, Boston, Madison, Wis-
consin, Los Angeles, Chapel Hill,
North Carolina, San Jose, Santa
Barbara, and Buffalo.

it often seemed at Monday's
press conference, that the admin-
istration was either entangled in
its own beauracracy or that it was
giving in to the demands of Kel-
leher and conservatives of the Al-
bany Community.

The New Left Organizing Com-
mittee and Student Mobilization
issued a joint flyer Monday morn-
ing charging the university of the
latter — of attempting “to make
the impact of Mr. Kunstler's visit
as negligible as possible."

In an interview Friday, John
Kaufman of the NLOC, vowed
that if Kunstler's speech were
barred from the gym, students
would "tear this place apart." The
anger and disgust almost universal-
ly displayed at one press confer-
ence gave added impact to these
words.

"A lot of students will be an-
gry, especially those who can't get
in,” Kaufman said. The
administration had offered Page

room Saturday night.

They ale their dinners instead
in the dining room of Brubacher
Hail, the graduate student dining
area. They carried signs and chant-
ed “Good food...not shit!"

A meeting was immediately ar-
ranged with Mr. Corbiey of Food
Service to discum the situation.
Six representatives—Lenny Moss,
Tony Cheh. Al Senia and Lenny
Marks (the four originators of the
action) along with Mat Heyman
and Phil Chunsky (president and
vice-president of Walden Council)
made a list of eight demands.

They ware:

1) Two fresh choices of meals
every day for dinner (with the op-
tion of serving leftovers as a third
choice).

2) No recooking of leftovers in-
to fresh meals. (This was in re-
sponse to the fact that leftover
meal and sausage are often used as
"fillers" for such meals as Ia-
sauna.)

8) The wearing of hair nets by
female food servers.
