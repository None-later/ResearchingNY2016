Teachers
Needed

by Dr. Richard Ellis

One of the greatest social prob-
lems facing us today is the loss of
human and economic resources
through traffic accidents, and it is
to this fact which I address this
brief article, Unless a major break
through in the number of high
school pupils who graduate from
formal traffic safety education
programs double in the next five
years, the tragedy will continue to
increase in severity.

Federal and State Governments
and local school districts are mak-
ing an all out effort to meet the
challenge, but they need our co-
operation. To meet. the needs of
the high school pupil, schools are
doubling the number of teachers
in their programs and the few
schools without programs are em»
ploying new teachers as fast as
they are available. And that brings
us to the crux of the problemnthe
present supply of qualified teach-
ers does not meet the demand and
needs of the local Behool districts.
There were at least twenty~fivc
traffic safety education positions
in New York State which were
not filled at the beginning of the
1967-68 school year.

University Juniors and Seniors
who have driver's licenses and are
enrolled in programs leading to
secondary certification should
give every consideration to on-
rolling in the elective prescrvicc
preparation program (TSP .150
and TSP 1151) for teaching traffic
safety education . A prospective

trict position who has dual ccrtil'i-
cation (a major field plus approval
in traffic safety education) has the
advantage according to school ad~
ministratorsI and therefore it be-
hoovcs students to prepare them-
selves accordingly.

The total program is cxplaincd
in the undergraduate catalog and

Candidates Discuss r
Issues at

by Bob Warner

All five gubernatorial can-
didates for the Democratic Party
nomination spoke in a panel dis-
cussion at the 19th Annual Poli-
tical Conference of the Women's
Division of the Democratic State
Committee held at the Hyatt
House in Albany Sunday night.

Before the candidates were in-
troduced. Stanley Stcingul.
Minority Leader of the Statc As-
sembly. spokc, “We can't afford
Ihc luxury of being rcsponsiblc
for a Nixon in lhc White House
and n ltockcl‘cllcr in Albany for
thc ncxl four years," hc said,
Slcingut cnnlimu-d. “\Vc can carry
the bnnncr of victory for all lhc
people of thc slatc."

The candidates attacked Rocke-
feller for his indifference to the
poor. the consumer, the coin-
muter and the drug addict.

Joseph Etlingcr. a Brooklyn al-
torncy spoke first, He scored the
heroine problem heavily. “lf elect-
ed Governor." bc said. “I will de-
mand lbe dcalb penalty for all im-
porters and wholesalers of her-
oinc."

Etlingcr also called for im~
mediate withdrawal from Viet-
nam. He criticized Rockcl'eller's
handling of unemployment. “Un-
employment in the ghcllos runs as
high as .‘lil'li, ycl lhc Governor is
blind to the problem."

Thomas J. Mackcll, District /\1-
torncy ol' Quccns. talkcd mostly
of drug addiction. which he calls
our most pressing problem. “lam
infuriated by the hypocrisy of the
Governor's (drug) program."
Mnckcll also cited the problems of
poor racc rclations, lack of hous-
ing, overcrowded subways and
commutcr railroads. and inequity
in the Ann'rican lax sll'llt‘ltlrc.

The theme of Eugene H. Nick-
erson’s short speech was unity in
the Democratic Party and the ur-
gnncy of deposing our inept and
dishonest Governor. First he
pledged to support any other of
the four candidates for the Dem-
ocratic gubernatorial nomination
should he use. He went on to cri-
ticize our tax structure, “Our tax-
cs have been unfairly collected.
The low and middle income
groups havc bccn called to pay
most of the taxes. while Gov.
Rockefeller protects his l'cllow bil~
lionnaircs and milliomuiircs." ’l‘lnI
(‘ounly I‘Ixccutivc dc-
plorcd the state's counly jails.
“'l'hcy turn out morcI criminals
than Ihcy lake in." he said.

Howard J. SamucIs. an upstate
industrialist and former Under
Secretary of Commerce, said that
his Party's first priority is “to
bring integrin back to New York
State Government," He called a
Democratic victory in New York
important lo the entire country."
Samucls also attacked Nixon. “It
is important to have a Democratic
victory so that New York State
will not be an outpost l'or lbc
policies of the Nixon administ-
ration." be said.

William vanden l'lcuvcl, a New
York attorney and former aide to
Robert hennedy criticized the
Governor for his lack of concern
about lhc consumer and lbc com-
muter. llc also talked on the her-
oinc problem. He said that French
Prcsidcnt I’ompidou, if he wcrc
really a friend of lhc United
Sialcs. would slop the exporting
of licroinc from Mnrscillcs into
this country.
