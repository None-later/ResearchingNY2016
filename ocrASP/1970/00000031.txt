Conflict of

Interests

To the Editors:

I feel that some clarification
and explanation is necessary re-
garding the Election Commission
ad that has appeared in the last
few issues of the ASP concerning
campaigning for Class Officers of
the Junior Class. The reason for
this is two-fold. Class Officer
elections are held in conjunction
with MYSKANIA elections; there
is no campaigning for MYS-
KANIA as it is felt that the people
should not be elected based on
the campaign they can run, but
rather on their accomplishments.
It has been and is felt that a candi-
date for Class Office who is also
running for MYSKANIA (as is the
case this year) should not cam—
paign at all since Whilecampaigning
for Class Office he might be given
an unfair advantage in the
MYSKANIA election by having
his name well publicized directly
prior to elections. In the same
vein , it. has been and is felt that
in order to insure the fairest pos-
sible class officer elections, that
ALL candidates for Class Office
from the Junior Class refrain from
any campaigning whatsoever.

It is hoped that the advertise-
ment in today's ASP will be read
in light of this letter.

Sincerely,
Jeannette Beckerman
Election Commissioner

ed" person did not know when or
where to get applications.

It seems to me that something
is lacking. If you were so interest-
ed, why did you not contact the
Student Association Ofﬁce to find
out when these elections would
take place? The Information Desk
at the Campus Center could also
have directed you to the proper
people. but aside from you taking
the initiative, the members of
Election Commission of the Stu-
dent Association have tried to in-
form the student body. An-
nouncements have been made
over WSUA, the Campus radio sta-
tion for the three weeks around
the deadline; the ASP, the campus
newspaper and central medium of
communication for the Univer»
sity, has also had the information
in it. for the three issues around
the opening and closing of the
nominations. And to further aid
the student who neither reads the
ASP or listens to WSUA, an aver-
age of 15 flyers were hand on
each quadrangle in such promi-
nent and busv places as the dinner
lines, and the mailboxes. All this
was done to insure that anyone
who reads, gets mail, or cats
would see the information.

Yet, with all this publicity, you
failed to know about the deadline.
You say that our answer of
“Those truly interested would
have known" is unwarranted and
irresponsible. Yes, something is ir-
responsible, bul I really can't go
along with your conclusion that it
is the answer that is irresponsible;
[ know of no other way to infor>
motion to the students other than
through the two main media of
communication on campus, and
hanging posters in prominent
Places. It then becomes the res
sponsibility of anyone "interest-
ed" to pursue the issue from
there.

Liberated Mixer
on the Wall

To the Editors:

Believe it or not, a very unusual
happening is in the making here at
SUNYA. As many of you know,
in the last few months, a small
sense of community has been
growing. Look at Gerry Wagner -
he is one of those responsible for
bringing many of us together; and
now this professor, who (lid such
a good job, is being fired. Gerry is
a threat to the Uni\ersity; the ad-
ministration is afraid of him

Well, we‘re going to do our part
in bringing people together, too.
On Sunday night 1, March 8th,
there Is going to be a mixer, but
one of a different type - one un-
like the usual mixer, with all those
zombies and their drunken friends
walking around looking for an
easy make... .

This is going to be the first
LIBERATED MIXER in our
school's history: 400 freaks are
bringing blankets, incense, kazoos,
and many other strange sur-
prises...Virgins will be offering
themselves up for life;Potter men
will be burning their jackets and
running naked with us; and many
other strange people will be drop-
ping in to play, and to do their
own thing.

If you play an instrument, or
anything that sounds good, bring
it. If you're in a rock group, recite
poetry, play folk music, or do any
other groovy thing, and would
like to help us out, call Kathie at
457-3791. We also need people
with any experience running light
shows, or anyone with any light
equipment.

We need people, because this
event (and many others, if this
works out) is for the people. if we
can get the groups to 'play for
free, we'll try not to charge admis-
sion, for money is not the reason
why this is being done. We want
to bring people together. and
show that it can be done here. So
SUNY, prepare to lose your vir-
ginity!

“The Music

('ommittcc for

Handwriting
on the Wall

To the Editors:

One wonders when the adminis-
tration of this concrete asylum
will read the handwriting on the
wall? If the events and frustra-
tions of the several hundred peo-
ple attending the 'I‘horne-Chcsin
news show (ll/W70) did not dem-
onstrate anything to the modern-
tors of that spectacle, then we are
quickly headed (if not almost at)
the politics of mass action.

Most of the damage has been
done to the student body in terms
of disaffectiou and ambivilencc;
however, the further state does
not necessarily result in the bag-
gage of the latter. Several hundred
people gathering on a Monday af-
ternoon for a "news conference"
indicates much more than whe-
ther or not William Kunstler will
have "official" use of the gymna-
slum.

What does it take to make the
administration realize that they

 

not only fail to understand stu-
dents, but that they also under-
estimate their intelligence, sensiti-
vity, and needs. When the build-
ings of other universities disappear
in the smoke and flames, our ad-
ministration perhaps feels secure
that “it can't happen here.” But
when the fuel of frustration final-
ly is ignited by the sparks that the
monarchical hierarchy has created
and kindled, then ultimately what
will the administrative leaders
have to show for their efforts 0;
student placation?

Yours truly,
John J. Fleitman

Student Power!

Dear Editors,

This is a reply to Thea Gentile's
letter in the February 27th issue
of the ASP. I work for Student
Power, and feel that the problem
is not whether someone gaVe the
finger to Thea, but rather the stu-
dent apalhy on campus. You may
note lhat many students take it as
a personal affront when you ask
them to sign a letter or a petition.
Others, in spite of the fact that
they feel that students need a
greater voice in this school, still
refuse to sign because they don't
want to get involved.

We didn't present people with
only a petition for Gerry Wagner,
but also with a letter quoting the
dcclaralion recently affirmed by
the University Senate that “stu-
dents are entitled to be consulted,
and their opinions and desires
weighed in the formation of de-
cisions on academic matters," as
well as expressing support for Ger-
ry.

We told lhc students that if
they could cross out the sentenCc
about Gerry if they disagreed with
our stand on him, but felt the
need for more student power.
Basically, the issue is the student‘s
say in his own education, and Ger-
ry Wagner is merely the current
focal point.

if to sit in a class three times a
week, listen, take notes, and pass
your tests, is "learning," then all
that is necessary for “learning” is
a textbook. Hopefully, part of the
learning process is to question and
not be satisfied with answers that.
are fed to you, to search for some
truths by yourself. We don’t need
more big~name faculty who can't
teach, but more people like Gerry
who make us think.

TUESDAY, MARCH 3, 1970

Nobody is better qualified to
judge how well we are taught than
we ourselves. The administration
and faculty are all bogged down in
their red tape and petty rules
about tenure and such. Just be-
cause someone published in DC
Comics, does that make him a bet?
ter teacher? Why don't you stop
getting uptight about small things
(not even done by one of our
members) and fight the big insult
the Administration has directed
toward you by refusing to listen
to you as an intelligent, rational
human being?

U ndemocratic

Dear Editor,

As a member of the class of
1971, lam aware of the tradition
that juniors seeking class offici-
will not campaign due to the con-
“lCl with the Myskania elections. I
feel that this tradition is outdated
and undemocratic. This year there
are thirteen positions open on
Mysdania and fourteen nominees,
thus the election is not that stung.
ficant whereas in the past with a
larger number of nominees it may
have been. Secondly, in an elect-
ion for class officers the ideas of
the candidates should be made
public. They should be allowed
and encouraged rather than dis~
couraged to reach their class
through any means possible. What
is the basis of an election without
campaigning? 1 have no idea. un-
less it is not to perpetuate that
which has existed in the past
whether it be good or bad. It is
abhorrent, in a university com
munity that the flow of ideas is
curtailed and it is even more ab-
horrent that this flow is curtailed
during aan election. l would be
glad to see the class of ‘71, my
class, to break from this oppres-
sive tradition and conduct their
campaign in a democratic manner.

Respectfully submitted.

Freedom

One commonly observed
characteristic of a political animal
is his willingness to grant license
to those of similar viewpoint
while seeking to repress opposi-
tion opinions. Troy Assemblyman
Neil Kelleher’s attempt to prevent
attorney William Kunstler from
speaking on this campus is true to
this characteristic. It is unjusti-
fiably repressive.

Kelleher, seeking to enhance his
popularity in an election year, has
chosen to appeal to the lowest in‘
slincts of the electorate regardless
of the infringements on the liber-
ties of Mr. Kunstler and those
who want to hear whal he has to
say. As in most ‘book burning‘

To Speak

campus not only have a right to
entertain speakers of various view-
points, but the obligation as well.

Implied in this policy, is a toler-
ance towards speakers with whom
we may disagree. Let us not fol-
low the misguided steps of Mr.
Kelleher and seek to silence the
voices of spokesmen for opposite
opinions. Should a spokesman of
the political right seek to speak at
SUNYA, it is our obligation to
show him the courtesy that the
Troy Assemblyman obviously
lacks for proponents of the left.

It is imperative that Mr. Kunst-
ler or any other advocate of a po-
litical position (whether it be pop—
ular or not) be allowed to speak at

type episodes, the Assemblyman
seems to be pre-occupied with
symptoms rather than causes of
society’s illnesses.

The SUNYA administration has
responded wisely to the situation.
defending its policy of allowing
students to schedule speakers
“with a Wltlt' range of social opin-
ions," We. the sludcnls, on this

this university. The acquisition of
truth is among the primary
functions a university must con-
cern itself with. If ideas are dan-
gerous. it is only because of fail-
ures in existing reality. It is best
to be exposed to all shades of
opinion, and let the individual de-
cide what is to be considered

truth. B'K.

Once again it is that exciting time of the year at SUNYA when 50
or 60 people go out and get their fraternity brother, suitemate, etc.
elected to office. Right now elections for class officers, MYSKANIA
and Alumni Board are upon us. Soon elections for LAAC, Central
Council and University Senate will be in order. Many criticism have
been made abou elections at Albany in the past. Since little change
has come from these criticisms they are worth repeating again.

It seems strange (luring the year when there is a lot of work to be
dom- by \arious groups that there are few people available to help.
Yet, when elections roll around suddanIy names start appearing all
over the campus and people are mysteriously inlcrcstctl.

The academic podium littered with posters is in example of this
and of the Albany State campaign philosophy - -' "stay hidden. don‘t
say anything and plaster your mime all over the place."

This so-called name game campaign has been in evidence in most
elections on campus for years. Attempts were made during the Univer-
sity Senate elections to break this philosophy. Candidates were en-
couraged to express their views so when some candidates did make a
positions statement it looked like improvement was being made. Yet,
instead a new even more dangerous trend was started. Candidates took
stands on platforms that were irrelevant to the offices they sought.
How can the peace symbol be equated with running the internal af-
fairs of the University. is a man to be elected to office just because
there is a peace sign on his posters?

There are many ramifications to this and other problems in our
elections. As it stands now, turnouts for voting in elections have been
quite small, Thus the power block vote has become a dominating
influence. The dorm, fraternity and other types of related groups go
oul and vote for an individual because he is a member, not because he
will do the best job.

It is up to the individual voter to get out and vote. Before he can do
that hUWcVer, the candidates must. make thcmscIVcs and their views
available to their constituents.

We must strive for larger voter turnouts. Perhaps by going to each
quad and lhc Campus Center.

The bloc votc must be disintegrated and all the people whose names
appear so suddenly must be kept activc;win or lose. Only then will we
be on our way to having a more active and less apathetic. University
student body. Find out who the people are. Get out and vote.
