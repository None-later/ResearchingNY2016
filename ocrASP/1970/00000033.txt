Football Very

Athletic director Dr. Alfred C.
Werner announced today that,
pending approval of its proposed
1970.71 budget by the New York
State Legislature, State University
at Albany will field a club football
team this fall. The budget Would
include provision to hire an ad-
ditional physical education de-
partment member. Dr. Werner
currently is seeking a man who
would coach football and lacrosse,
in addition to his teaching as-
signments in the department.

A six-game 1970 schedule has
been prepared in anticipation of
the university's first inter‘
collegiate football program. Three
home and three away games have
been lined up for the fledgling
gridders including home contests
with neighboring Siena College
and Hudson Valley Community
College. Home games will be
played on the ﬁeld encircled by
the running track behind the
physical education building. Per~
manent bleachers on the steps of
the building will accomodate an‘
estimated 2,200 persons and
temporary bleachers may provide
additional seating.

Road contests are scheduled
with Towson State College of Bari-
timore, Md., Marist College, and
State University College at Platts-
burgh. The season will open with
a home game against Rochester
institute of Technology on Home
coming Saturday, October II). On-
ly Hudson Valley, a two-year
school, and 'i‘owson State, which
played a club schedule last fall,
will field varsity teams. The other
foes, however, all have experience
as club teams.

The addition of football would
bring to ll the number of men‘s
intercollegiate sports at Albany.

Danes Rally
Win Over

by Jay Marshall

Last Saturday night, Albany
State borke a three—game losing
streak by downing Utica 89-77.
Albany's offensive output topped
the previous single game high of
77 registered against Central Con-
necticut two weeks ago. The vic-
tory assured State of ﬁnishing
with at least an even record for
the season, marking the fifteenth
straight season in which Conch
Sauers Iias had a winning team at
Albany.

The Great Danes have been
plagued by poor shooting
throughout the season, however,
Saturday night they shot an excel-
lent 50'It from the field, including
24-37 in the second half. Jack Jor‘
daii led State with twenty-fivc
points and guards Jack Adams and
Jim Miisterson each added twcn-
ty-two. Forward AI Reid picked
up eight assists, the single game
hiin for the “369-70 season.

Tonight, Albany travels north

The playoffs are about to begin
and all eyes are focused on League

to decide the final standings. The
Brothers 1 and Potter Club ended
the season in a dead heat for first
as did UFS and the Bruins for

the Club twice during the regular
season, and are hoping to do it
again in the playoffs. However,
they dropped their last two deci-
sions, to the Brains and U.F.S.

score was 67-33 in Oneonta's
favor. During the process of their
victory, Oneonta established six
new Albany Pool records one of
which, the 200 yd. breast stroke,
bettercd last year's SUNY champ-
ionships mark by almost a full sec-
ond.

Looking back over this first full
varsity ycar, (.‘oach Brian Kelly
states that he was very pleased
with the amount of improvement
the team has made. Even though
the team had amassed only a 1-11
record, the actual experience of
varsity competition will make our
team, which is a largely freshman
contingent that much stronger
next year.

As far as next season is con-
cerned, Kelly has done some per-
sonal recruiting which will defi-
nitely strengthen our young team.
Three promising candidates who
have already been accepted to
next year's freshman class are
Gary Canter, an individual Medlay
swimmer from i’oughkeepsie
i'ligh, John Dos Passos, il Butter-
l'lier from Bethlehem High, and
Leonard Van Ryn, a freestylcr al-
so froin Bethlehem.

West Coast

Zoot

by Bob Roscnblum

Soloist: Don Ferrar, Trumpet:
Bob Brookmeyer, Piano and
Trombone: Buddy Clark, Bass:
Zoot Sims, Temr:Gerry Mulligan,
leader, baritone sax, and piano,
and concert jazz band.

Although west coast jazz is
pretty much part of the past it is
still interesting both musically and
sociologically. It is the first time
that a new direction in jazz has
been dominated by whites rather
than blacks (although Miles Davis
- a black trumpet player has often
been credited as its unofficial
leader). its music has been char-
acteristically introverted, and
morose rather than angry and ex-
troverted. As a result it can be.
come rather limpid and boring
But the Mulligan big band has suc-
cessfully eluded these pitfalls,
thanks largely to the presence of
one of the most fluent saxopho-
nists, Zoot Sims.

Side one opens with “Go
Home." A slow chordal, bluesy
piano introduction leads into a
Four Brothers sound slaling the
four bar melody against a Ironi-
bone-sax pigment. Mulligan slips
in a simple hilt enthusiastic bari-
tone sax solo and steps back for
Zoot. With a warm and bluesy be-
ginning Sims builds llirough a SCI"
ies of counter riffs by the trom-
bone and trumpet. set-lions. The
whole band enters and Sims
finishes a not completely coir
clusivc solo.

“Barbara 's Theme" was nicely
scored by composer Johnny Mali-

Sims Showcase

del with semi-Ellingtonian trum-
pet and reed voicing around Mulli~
gsn who states the counter mei-
ody on his baritone. Ferrara's
muted trumpet solo stands the
test of repeated listening, as he
makes good use of varying
rhythmic approaches. Mulligan re-
turns with a short buoyant solo.
The chart sounds a little like a
sound track, but it's nice.

"Theme From ‘1 Want to Live'
" reminds me of a snake-slow and
lazy with a writhing melodic line.
This also has a baritone lead
which makes for an interesting
sound, but it is too repetitive
rhythmically. Mulligan‘s sax solo
is dead and Brookmeyer sounds
like a joke although he becomesa
little more inspired when joined
by gowl trumpet riffs. Mulligan is
back in a duet with bassist Clark
which transofmrs into a series of
exchanges. Nice ideas. but no
soul.

it is on side two that this vol-
canic beauty erupts. "Red Door,"
an up tempo number, opens Willi
Mulligan and Sims in the lead.
Sims thcn breaks loose with a
hard driving solo, with an extra
drop of blue to fit the mood.
Brookmcycr moves lo the piano
bench and plays some nice cool
stuff. A bass solo lhcii cmcrgcs at
a fast walk and Mulligan suddenly

csly ~ his best solo on the album.

licgin exchanges that evolve into
an incredible exhibilon of con-
Irapunlal simultaneous invention.

a beautiful ballad. The test of a

great jazz musician is his ability to ’

play a ballad. Zoot seems to relish
the challenge, taking his time,
carefully fitting the melody to his
personality and to the full back-
ground arrangement. Full, bluesy,
touchineg melancholic, Sims
soars into an implied stop time
that sounds like a description of a
smile after the tears are wiped
away. Then Zoot returns to the
original tempo with sprinklings of
the melody and a hint of double-
time, as the mood alternates from
melancholy to happy. What a
statement of that touching meI.
ody!

“Apple Core" is an up tempo
vehicle for Sims. As Zoot breaks
loose from the baritone-tenor lead
he launches into his best uptempo
solo on record. His use of spaces
and perfectly placed accents is
pure wizardry and shows he is not
ignorant of the legacy of Charlie
Parker. The stop time device is
used here as Sims plays some
striking figures thal breaks up the
audience and as he launches him.

The numbers of MEV or harm in Romr

PA C MEV

by Warren Burt

Saturday night, it happened.
With the six musicians of MEV
and their synthesizers, prepared
pianos, organs, drains, and other
instrumenls in the lead, the liver
lwo hundred people in the PAC's
Experimental Theatre gave llicll‘l'
selves up to an evening of un-
bridled joy and music making.
The Ioiie was sct for theI whole
event when, as the audience ar-
rived, lhc MEV members were al~
ready at their instrumenls doing a
little improvisational thing known
as “Foreplay.” The other sections
of the niassM improvisation were
knownsas "Rounds," “Les Mou-
lons (le Pamirge," "Sticks," and
“Sound Pool.“0f these, “Rounds,
“Moutons,” and “Sticks” all have
u structure for the MEV group
“Sound Pool" is totally free. And
total, beautiful freedom was what

Happening
it was. Everyone making their
own noises, sounds, and musics
(irrelevant word!) and joining in a
joyous communal happening that
before it ended, included not only
music, but (lance and drawing as
well. And on the macrocosmic lev—
cl, if anyone else was tuned into
it. there was yet another beauty.
For all these sounds being made
and collectively tossed into the
pool formed a really pretty sound.
Now it would thicken Iip, now
thin out, now soften up, now get
louder, louder, louder... .

ll was beautiful - musician and
non-musician (more irrelevant ter-
minology!) alike joining in a spon-
taneous celbration of life. And
that was the important thing, i
think - bring music out of its stuf-
fy environments and make it a
more spontaneous activity
