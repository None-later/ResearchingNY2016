Democrats State Views

In

Continued from papa 3
Democratic Conference held a
similar panel for its Senatorial
candidates. Arthur Levitt, State
Comptroller, delivered the key-
note for the conference. He called
for lohg range planning, greater

discipline in fiscal planning, and-

said that the Republican Adminis-
tration in our state has “wasted
the present and mortgaged the fu-
ture.”

The Senatorial candidates
called Goodell an opportunist. and
inconsistent in his voting record.
Paul O'Dwyer, a New York City
attorney and candidate for Senate
in 1968, attacked NAM (Nixon,
Agnew, and Mitchell). When asked
about Congressional powers over
the war, Inc said that Conngress nnp
until now has been neglecting
their right of either declaring or
ceasing war inn regard to Vietnam;
he said that Congress must exer-
cise its power in order to end the

war. O'Dwycr also severely attack-
ed Goodell's record for its voting
inconsistencies. Goodell voted
against cuts in depletion allow-
ance and voted against the Gore
Amendment which would have
raised the minimum income tax
reduction from $600 to $800.
O'Dwyer also called for a volun‘
tecr army and a cease fire in Vict-
nam.

Richard L. Ottingcr, a West-
chcster Congressman, said that we
have to reach the silent majority.
Ottinger also attacked Goodcll’s
record. While he was :1 Congress-
man from Jamestown, Goodall
voted against rat control and the
food stamp program. Ottinger
scored the paradox of inflation
and unemployment which he
maintained Nixon 'is doing
nothing about.

Richard D. McCarthy, an up-
statc Congressman who is Chair-
man of a Democratic study group
on environmental problems,

Panel Discussion

talked mostly of pollution and
germ warfare. The Congressman

a one-time supporter of the repeal" 

  
 
 

of capital punishment said that 

now he is dubious of his original
position and added that he could
see imposing the death penalty on
pushers.

Theodore C. Sorensen, an attor- '

ncy from New York City and I
former aid to John and Robert
Kennedy talked about party
unity. Sorcnsen also attacked
Goodeli's record. He said that
Goodell supported Goldwater.
Nixon and Agnew, andnow is ob-
ligated to Rockefeller for his ap-
pointment. Sorensen attacked the
crime problem. He said that crime
must be fought at the roots--the
prison and judicial systems and
the social ills in America. He also
said that the federal government is
not meeting its responsibility on
the drug problem. He called for
action against those countries that

export drugs. He called poverty 

and hopelessness tlnc root cause of
drug addiction.

Council acce ts g

enpensesof

Last night in a specnal meeting
Central Council decided that it
would assume responsibility for
William Kunstler's speaking here
Thursday night. After extended
debate Council voted in favor of
a motion by Dick Wesley and Dave
Ncufcld that Student Association
assume the responsibility of all
operating and security expenses
involving use of the gym. This was
estimated to cost about $250.

The $1000 speaking fee for
Kunstler who is being sponsored
by the Student Mobc and New
Left Organizing Committee, is
coming from the Social and Poli-
tical Concerns Line of Com-
munity Programming Commission
of S.A.

unstIe

Ken Stokem suggested the
move of having S.A. maintain re-
sponsibility for the event, through
Political and Social Positions
Committee. He pointed out the
precedent set by S.A.‘s funding
the buses to Washington. Vic
Looper supported the suggestion
saying that S.A. should deﬁnitely
take responsibility for the event.

Lenny Kopp stated that he was
certain that P.S.P. could do a bet-
ter job of conducting the opera-
tions involved.

Stokem further pointed out
that with the amount of student
interest shown in this event the
351,250+ was certainly less expon—
sivc than any concert we could
contract with similar attendance.

as an alternative, but Kaufman

llaid “nearly two thousand were

. .expected."

When he telephoned. O'Reilly
Assemblyman Kelleher had also
demanded additional police super-
vision of the speech if it were

' held.

Dr. O‘Rcilly however, left it un-
clear as to whether SUNY security
police would be supplemented
with Albany city police. He said
Friday that “to his knowledge"
no additional precautions were
being taken, but also noted that

" “we haVe very few security po-
‘ lice." In ansWering iKelleher he

had stated that the university does
“eVerything possible" to protect
students and community mem-
hers.

One reason for the outbreak of
violence in Santa Barbara was the
tension created between adminis-
tration and students over the
ﬁring of a teacher. The same issue
has developed here along with the
general demand for more direct
student faculty control of the uni-
versity.

“Why do you have the power
to decide who uses the gym!"
Kaufman cued at the conference.
“Student Power!" was the echo
from another student.

Asked whether he had one rea-
son to expect violence Thursday
night, Dr. O’Reiliy stated:

“All I know is what I read in
the newspapers. Mr. Kunstler has
been at places where there have
been demonstrations which some-
times head to violence. As to when
ther he was responsible for them
or whether they occured by coin-
cedence, there is nothing in the
press to make clear. Certainly,
no one has charged him with incit-
ing the riots and we can't say he
was responsible."

Asked whether he expected vio-
lence, Kaufman replied “Do
you?"
