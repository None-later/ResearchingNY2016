“There is no connection i)t‘-

Gruening said.

Kennedy is not as guilty as
Johnson as far as our involvement
in Vietnam is concerned. Kennedy
oiin sent 'advisors.‘ it was John-
son who “lied to Congress and the
nation and got the blank check to
send troops." Senators Gruuning
and Morse were the only two
Senators to votc against the Gulf
of 'l‘on kin Resolution.

Congressional hearings into the
incidciit disclosed the fact that

thc Miiddix, the ship allcgcdly on

ruutinc patrol was in fuct. a Pueb-
lo lypc spy engaged in a hostile,
act supporting South Vietnamese
in North Vietnamese waters at-
tacking North Victnamcse shore
and ship installations. “The North
Vietnamese wcrc correct in firing
on thc Mnddix. 'l‘hoiigh shc was
not Iiil or attacked in scIf-(Icfcnsc.
Johnson used this as his cxcusc
for bombing lhc North in
i'clnllialion for an incident wc
provokcd!" (irucning continued.

“No good at all has come of
this war. As a rcsull. this war has
dcslroycd our country's image in

which influenced his counter-
-Kunstler resolution. “Kunstler is
sentenced to jail and is free by a
legal gesture. It was the judge's
right to extend that freedom. time
needed to appeal the sentencing.
Instead, Kunstler is engaged on a
speaking tour which has lead to
rioting. He is abusing the privi-
lege.” Because of the convictions
of conspiring to riot and the riot
at. Santa Barbara following a
K unstlcr speech, “these men
should be restrained to prevent
furliicr violence."

No ‘Clicap Publicily'

Kcllchcr expressed concern
over people's rights to speak free-
Iy but concurrently is “responsi-
ble to the district" from which he
was elected. He stated that “05%
of the people from my district
which have written in are In favor
of my slund."

“I am not sucking cheap publi-
city. 1 don‘t need it. I was elected
by a margin of 11.000 votes."
I’rolcction of his constituency was
the principlc reason given for his
stand. not publicity or politics.

Kcllchcr admitted bcing con-
tacted by numerous individuals on
the constitutional aspects of the
resolution baring free speech and
confcsscd, "had Santa Barbara

been different. I would not have
been involved. In the future.
should similar events occur. I will
go about it in a different way."

Assemblyman Kelleher will not
attend either the Kunstler speech
or the anti-Kunstler demonstrat-
ion by the Disabled American
Veterans. “This would be a cheap
political trick."

No one from the Rules Com-
mittee would comment upon the
legal implications of the resol-
ution. but thty are sending a copy
to the ASP for clarification.

Flashlights for Freedom

James Cain, former state direct-
or of the Disabled American War
Veterans. an organizer of the
anti-Kunstler demonstration and a
government employee at the
Watcrvliet Arsenal statM‘wc have
no intention of causing any
trouble. we just do not agree with
him (Kunstler)."

He expressed concern over
"attempts being made to under-
mine the American government
by groups in the FBI and Unamer-
ican Activities Committee lists.”
Cain called upon all “outraged”
citizens to come to Fuller road to
demonstrate, carrying a
“flashlight as a torch. a symbol of
freedom."
