Adams is a native of Stinger-
lands, N.Y., where he attended
Clayton A. Bouton H.S. (Voor-
heesvilie, N.Y.). There he played
baseball, and football in addition
to basketball. At Bouton Jack
averaged it) points per game in his

Colleges anti Universities 1969
and he is the Vice President of

The New Donovan Outlook—

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Reﬂected In His Music

by Susan Hyrcaj

Donovan is god. I use a small ‘g’
becasue many people and things
are also god. Beauty is god, and
Donovan is beauty. As Phil Ochs
says, “He is one of the few writers
whose aesthetic is his own per-
son.”

He now believes in a “natural
high" rather titan the chemically
induced high of drugs. But having
experimented with Mexican agri-
culture himself, he should be able
to understand people when they
get their highs through grass and,
sometines, later make the transi-
tion to the natural high.

After these lavish words in
praise of Donovan, it may seem
strange that i don’t care for his
album “Barabajugel.” It has some
good material on it, especially
“Atlantis,” “Where Is She," “To
Susan on the West Coast," “Baru-
bajagal," and even “I Love My
Shirt.“ The other songs are worth
their weight in plastic, and that‘s
about how sensitive they are.

The album l have in mind as
being his best is “Donovan in
Concert." Many people don't like
concert albums because of the
applause between numbers and
the disadvantage of live rather
than studio recording. Howeverl
like the idea of getting away from
all the mechanical, computerized
gadgetry and returning to the un-
processed, human music. The in-
convenience of a little clapping is
really only as distracting as you
make it.

“Young Girl Blues" is beautifut
in the sympathy and emotion
breathed into it. It centers on the
loneliness of a young girl trying to
cope with a phony world. There is
a reflection of depression through-
out the song. Even the everyday
things seem to be against her.
(“Coffee on, milk gone. Such a
sad life and fading")

"Celeste" is a highly personal
revelation of the individual experi-
ence of living. It tells of the
changes and transitions being
made in a difficult stage of life,
and the anticipation of experienc-
ing many more things with the
help of another person.

it also tells of the dilemma of
capturing and expressing the fleet-
ing thoughts and insights which
slip through our minds. l‘My songs
are merely dreams, They come
visiting my mind. We talk awhile
by a crooked stile, You're so
lucky to catch a few.“

The most expressive lines are,
“All our sould are (ieeper titan we
can see," and “Everybody is a
part of everything anyway.” it
makes us realize that we have a lot

Children’s

of looking-inside-ourselves to do u

as well as a commitment to be-
come a part of other people’s
lives. Best of all is the line which
more or less summarized my
philosophy of life: “You can have
everything if you let yourself be.”

Donovan has evolved from a
simple cighteen-year—oid boy in
laborer's boots. denim jacket and
miner‘s cap to a complex being
whose mind has becotne his es-
sence. His music has become more
involved and sophisticated, grow-
ing from a single guitar accompan-
iment to a carefully blended pot-
pourri

Yet, In a way, the stmpltctty
remains. To quote Judy Collins,
“He sees things: he doesn’t tell

you about the world: he creates »- i

it."

It has. in the past, been the practice of this page to present one re-

Therefore, itt order to present the readers with both sides, a second
review. written by a different reporter, will be presented when the ed-
iror feels that there is a need. This will not mean that the ﬁrst reporter
was in error. It will merely present another opinion. The reader may
decide which he feels is there appropriate.

This policy shall be instituted Tuesday with a second look at
