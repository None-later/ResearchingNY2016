FRIDAY, MARCH 6, I970

Council to Undergo
Power Separation

At last Sunday's special meet-
ing of Central Council on the Stu-
dent Association Constitution,
Council passed a motion that re-
scinded action it had previously
passed at last Thursday’s meeting.
Lenny Kopp brought up the mo-
tion that struck down Mike Lam-
pert's amendments to the consti-
tution that provide for two semes-
ter‘s experience on Central Coun-
cil in order to run for Student As-
sociation President.

Kopp claimed that Lamperts
amendments were not in keeping
with the progressive spirit with
which the constitution is trying to
deal. Carol Tibbcts argued against.
the move saying that prospective
candidates would have no con-
ception of the immensity of the
job of the presidency, unless they
had had some council experience.

Ken Stokem and Lenny Kopp
pointed out that the qualifications
would limit the filed of probable,
possible candidates for President
and Vice-President to something
less than 10. Kopp further argued
that you can’t have a representa-
tive government without a repre»
sentative president.

Chuck Ribak argued against
this saying that the school is a (lic-
tatorship anyhow. Dick \VL‘SII')’
supported Kopp pointing out the
dangers of a credibility gap. Kopp
made the final comment before
the vote saying that the students
must be given the right to express
themselves.

Kopp moved for a roll i‘nll vote,

the result of which was ||-7~‘_’
Following Kopp’s motion ‘s suc-

cess, Ralph DiMarino made an

amendment that called for the

president to be elected by a ma-
jority rather than a plurality vote,
removed the president's position
as presiding officer of Central
Council, made the vice-president
elected by a 2/3 ‘5 vote of Council
rather than a plurality vote of the
Student Association, and made
the V-P preciding officer of Cen-
tral Council.

Lenny Kopp immediately at-
tacked this as “...still trying to
stick to the past with an elitist
government.“ Di Marino said that
this was just a step towards fur-
ther separation of powers in Stu~
dent Association. This opened up
a whole new concept in the area
of the Constitution dealing with
the officers and their powers and
separation of powers between
Central Council and an executive.
To facilitate freer discussion on
this new concept Council moved
to a committee of the whole.

As a committee Council at-
tempted for the rest of the meet-
ing to work out. a viable, working
method of separating powers.
General consensus was that tlicre
would he a separation bctwocn a
president and vice-president at
Student Association and chairman
of Central Council.

It was undecided at this time
how and what powers would be
divided and added except that the
president would probably IIVL‘ ve-
to power over Central Council
hills with a 2/.‘l's vote of (iouncil
overriding that veto,

Previous to adjournment Coun-
cil formed a committee to be
headed by Vic Looper and Lenny
Kopp to look into formulation of
the separation of powers further.

Changes

in Parking Policy

by David Peck

"II'lir’i‘r'iis, lln' pi‘r'sciil parking
policy of SlWl'gl discriminates
first against stinlonls and slill fur
lll('l' against resident sturli-nls he it
resolved l/iul [/10 Senate l't'pl'tll lll(‘
preferential par/ring policy. "

Steven Villiino has introduced
the above bill in order to make
residence hall living more like
apartment house living. He thinks
that since resident students are
paying approximately $600 per
semester for room and board,
they are therefore entitled to de-
cciil parking facilities rather than
COI‘ITI‘IIULCI'S, and the rest for resi-
dents. Students from Alumni
Quad who drive to school are
viewed as residents and also have

the “back of the lot" facilities
they now have.

The preferential parking policy
now in use sets aside the first few
rows for faculty. the next few for
to park in the back. In place of
this, the bill would institute a
parking policy of a first-come.
first-served nature, except for the
first two rows which would be re-
served for those with a special
medical parking permit.

Many residents use their cars to
drive to Work or for student
teaching. Villano does not believe
that they will all park in front of
the lot as opponents of the bill
state. He also points out that com-
mutcrs don't pay $600 for room
and board. Villuno doesn’t own a
car.

PIE Discusses
Sterilization

by Lesley Weinblatt

The diverse topics of steril-
lzation and this weekend's pre-
-teach-in conference were the sub-
jects of the Wednesday night PYE
meeting.

The meeting began with a dis-
cussion on sterilization and fea-
tured two guest speakers. The
first, Ken Lucowiak, a graduate
student in Biology, approached
the subject from a physiological
standpoint. He traced the concept
of sterilization to its inception in
the late 1800’s. At that time, it
was used mainly as a vehicle for
publicizing the philosophy of Eu-
genics, the development of a purer
race throug compulsory steril-
ization of the lower classes.
Lucowiak added that population
control wasn’t taken into account
at the time. He went on to give a
detailed explanation of the actual
biological process involved in sterv
alization.

Following the lecture by
Lucowiak, Dr. Richard Brown of
the Physics Department addressed
the meeting on the legal and social
aspects of sterilization and abor-
tion. He announced that Senator
Earl Bridges has sponsored a coni-
promise abortion bill that has yet
to leave committee. Dr. Brown
urgcdthat all in favor of liberalized
abortion laws write their con—
gressmen in support of bill
3-8556.

The subject of this weekend’s
pre-tcach-in conference was han-
.lled by Sue Cypcrt, conference
coordinator. She made a desperate
plea for beds to accommodate the
~100 people expected to convene
to discuss the teach-in scheduled
for April 22. The weekend will
feature several lectures and work-
shops, the highlight of which will
be a lecture by Congressmap
Richard Ottinger on Friday eve-
ning at 7:30 in the Gym. Miss
Cypcrt urged that anyone who
will be able to provide a bed for
the weekend should contact her
immediately.

CORRECTION

The Albany Student Press
wishes to correct a misleading
omission found in the lead story
of the Tuesday, March 3, l970
issue, entitled “Kunstlcr's
Coming Arouses University" by
Neill Sliiiniihrin. The quotation,
"The place llt’ should be right
now is injiiil. " should have been
attributed to Assemblyman Neil
Kcllchcr. The ASP realizes tliiil
this omission could have been
misinterpreted and regrets this
oversight.
