ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

BUST AND NEAR-BUST

by Al Senia

The following two articles should be taken as a warning by students in the University community.
Caution and precaution should be everyone’s guidelines for the campus drug scene. Dr. Thorne has
continually reiterated the policy that the University is not a “refuge for lawbneakers." The most
important fact to remember is that under current university policy, R.A.'s are required to act as
policemen. As far as drugs are concerned, they are not advisers to be taken into the student's confidence.
Until this is corrected, it is the student's best interest not to discuss drugs with his resident assistant. One
should never, in any circumstance, show drugs to his RA. Resident Assistants have no choice but to act
as policemen when given the option.

Campus security, backed up by
state police, swooped into
Anthony hall on State Quad late
Wednesday night and arrested two
students on a variety of drug
charges. Between $2,000 and
$5,000 worth of drugs and equip-
ment were seized.

State police were called into
campus at. the request of campus
security, following consultations
between the security offiCe, dorm
directors, and Miss Norma Edsell,
Director of Residences. She noti-
fied Dr. Thorne of the action.
Presumably, he played a role in
the decision.

Quantities of marijuana, hush-
hish, LSD, mescaline, and opium

Dutch Quad

Two weeks ago this Saturday,
there was a party on the ninth
floor of Stuyvesant Tower on
Dutch Quad. For a short time,
exits were blocked, elevators were
halted on the floor, and six Resi-
dent Assistants guardcd the stair
ways. No one was informed us to
what was happening; the director
claimed Inter he was looking for
candles. At the presidential press
con- ference the following Mon-
day, both Kuusisto and Thorne
claimed to know nothing of the
incident. After speaking to many
people (including ’I‘hornc) the
true story finally came to light:
There was reason to believe drugs
were being used at the party and n
near-bust occurred. Two state
policemen were at the security
building, ready to lend assistance
to security in the event of a bust.
It seems a number ofstudents had
been complaining both to security
and the student affairs office
about the increasing frequency of
marijuana and drug use on cam-
pus. One student apparently
phoned security gave a tip about a
planned drug party that Saturday
night in Stuyvesant Tower. and
volunteered to obtain informa-
tion. Dr. Thorne went to great
lengths to explain that, both for
moral and legal reasons, the uni
versity does not employ student
drug informers; nor does does it
encourage such activity on the
part. of students. At any rate, the
dorm director, who was new to
his job, was notified and went
upstairs to investigate. R.A.‘s
barred the exits while the ele-
vators were halted at that floor.

State Quad

along with a variety of pipes,
scales, and cutting instruments
were confiscated. It was believed
to be the largest haul of drugs,
narcotics, and refining equipment
ever found on campus.

The arrests came after the dorm
director became convinced that at
least two students “were possibly
involved with drugs.“ He refused
to comment on how he reached
that conclusion, but it is believed
that one of the resident assistaan
who was very friendly with at.
least one of the students, went to
his room and told him to “cool
it“ as far as drugs were concerned.

The student. apparently "cooled
it" a little too much. He spread

This step was supposedly taken to
prevent the students from panic-
ing. There was a report of a
student trying to leave and being
manhnn dled by an R.A, However,
Dr. Thorne stated that his re-
search indicated :1 Student
attempted to kick an RA. in the
groin. No drugs were found. One
student and his date were su-
spectcd of possessing a quantity
of drugs, they voluntarily wenl
downstairs with the director and
then cmplied their pockets in
front of the director although
they were not asked to. They then
left the building. It should be
noted that no arrests Were made
bolther by securin or state police,
In fact, neither entered the build-
ing, except for Lt. Henighan who
was in the lobby of Stuyvesant
Tower for a few seconds. Nor was
Miss Edscll or Dr. ’l‘horne notified
of the incident by the dorm direc-
tor. The major issue seems to be
that state police were on campus,
ready to make arrests. it is also
significant that there was little
cooperation from any segments
of the university in our attempt to
discover exactly what did happen
in Stuyvesant Tower two weeks
ago.

Because of the large quantity of
drugs involved, it. was decided to
call in the B.C.l. (Bureau of Crimi-
nal Investigation~~slalc police)

marijuana, LSD, and an assort-
ment of other illegalities in front
of the R.A. to show proof he
would stay “clean.”

Unfortunately, for the student,
the R.A. had no choice (under
existing University drug policy)
but to inform the dorm director.
The dorm director called Lt.
Henighan in Security for consult-
ation on legal procedure.

Two directors then visited the
students’ rooms and asked the
two to go through their belongs
ings. The choice was theirs and
they agreed. The drugs were
found by the directors who noti-
fied Lt. Henighan.

The two students were arrested
and the drugs sent to be analysed,
Dr. Thorne stated yesterday
that he could not allow the
University to giVe snntuary to
lawbreakcrs and also pointed
out that law enforcement agen-
cies have the right to come on
campus at any time. “The law is
on the side of the state police,"
he said. He indicated that future
visits by state police could be

expected.

FRIDAY, MARCH 6, I970

Kuusisto Statement
on Environment

Two weeks ago a proposal was
presented to President Kuusisto
that there be a Moratorium on the
alteration of our natural campus.

The proposal was made at the
President’s weekly press con-
ference by Edward Shaw. a
SUNYA student and a member of
both PYE and Environmental
Forum. The proposal asked that
there be "the absolute guarantee
that no further cutting oftrees or
shrubs or plants, or alteration of
drainage, or introduction of new
roads, etc. will be done until a
hearing is held at which Environ-
mental Forum students and pro.
fessors in addition to PYE mem-
bers and other interested parties
of the University Community are
represented. ”

In a reply to this request Presi-
dent Kuusisio has sent letters to
Elwin Stevens University Archi-
tect, Clifton Flather, Administra-
tive Director and Anthony
Adinalfi, General Manager Slate
University construction Fund.

The text of the tellers is as
follows:

The current concern with the
need to protect our environment
from further careless dcspoilation
evokes considerable response from
some students and faculty mem-
bers on campuses across the
country. Quite properly, these
members of the academic com-
munity are calling for the Univer-
sity to take a leadership role and
to begin with its own campuses
and their immediate environs. Just
as some people have questioned
the propriety of the University‘s
growth in urban settings at the
cost of additional facilities with
what seems to them to be a lack
of concern for man '5 basic need to
enjoy natural beauty and ~-above
all-- to survive. They expect us to
weigh needs for physical growth
and change against any possibly
permanent destruction of nature
conceivable involved.

The State University all Albany
is one of several campuses in the
system where such concerns are
bL‘iﬂlt voiceduln the past all of us
have assumed that the need to
provide facilities to satisfy the
rapidly growing educational de-
mands of our society was self
justified. Some, however, question
this assumption and expect eco-
logical questions lo be considered
at every stage of the development
of physical facilities. SUNYA has

In an effort to be assured of the
wisest possible use of our natural

for educational service to the peo-
ple of this State, I am taking the
following steps:

1. I am sharing with you infor-

campus environmental concern
with this letter;

2. I look forward to a closer
planning and development rela-
tionship between your office and
our campus in matters of environ»
mental concern related to con-
strauction;

3. i am requesting that. I be
informed (with a duplicate infor-
mation copy to be provided Mr.
Walter M. Tisdale, Assistant to the
President for Planning and Devel-
opment.) at least 10 days to two
weeks before any new con»
struction work is undertaken on
this campus involving moving
earth, trees, bushes, plants, or
major drainage patterns;

-'l. I hope that representatives of
your offices may be able to share
with interested students and facul-
ty members here at SUNYA an
insight into your procedures and
goals because prejudices, rumors,
and lack of information produce
misinformation, misconceptions,
and illvwill where this can well be
avoided; and

5, I am encouraging the do
velopment at SUNYA of a Cam-
pus Forum to elicit opinions from
and to allow for discussion by the
academic community on issues of
major concern.

In the interest of good coin-
municntions on this campus, [am
also sharing this letter with the
President of our Student Central
Council, Mr. Terry Mathias, and
the local student campus news
media (the ASP‘ Albany Student
Press--and station WSUA).

Child Care Center on Campus:

Administration Not Committed

by Aralynn Abare

“To commit or not to commit"
was the question at yesterday's
open meeting, sponsored by Wo-
men's Liberation, with Vice-
President Clifton Thorne concern-
ing the establishinan of a child
care center. on campus.

Dr. Thorne was to report at the
meeting any progress made on the
demands submitted to him by
Women's Liberation two weeks
ago, but the group wanted, as
Sally Pollock put it, “a commit-
ment", i.e. a “yes” or "no" as to
whether or not Dr. Thorne backed
the effort. He would not give it,

“I really don‘t know yet wheth-
er or not the university has the
responsibility for these young-
sters," he said in a later interview,
“however I favor a full and open

discussion of the problem as a
legitimate and proper one to be
solved."

The remainder of the meeting
was devoted to opinions from the
over 200 students, staff, faculty
and administration in attendance.

Dr. Harry Hamilton, director of
EOP, questioned the obviousness
of the proposnl's soundness which
is based on the "highly question-
able" assumption that the univer-
sity should provide a (lay care
center nt all, He asked about the
possibility that, in the long run,
the center might become nn incen-
tive to overpopulation. He also
cited the university‘s “high num-
ber of other priorities."

Snlly Pollock, a leader of Wo-
men's Liberation, expressed the
hope that the university “make

At PYE Conference

by David Peck

Students from all over the slain-
packed into Inn-lure ('cnler 2-l
Friday night to hear Muyor
Erastus (‘orniug and Congressman
Richard Oilinger open the state-
wide I’Yl'l l’lanning Conference.
Over 300 sludenis came to
SUNYA last Weekend to make
preparations for the April 22
nationwidiI tench-in.

Mayor Corning slated that
the tench-in will be the “largest.
demonstration in the history of
the World.” He stated that Albany
has “raised the dollar signs on
sewage plants." He also inplied
that the Tobin Parking Co, llti‘.
shouldn‘t be attacked as a pol-
luler.

A member of the New Left
Organizing Committee stood up
and charged that Corning has been
polluting Albany for thirty years.
He answered that he “Takes
second place to no man in his love
for his environment."

Another member of the NLOC

claimed that lhe United Traction
and 'l‘ransport Co. (bus line) is
one of ilu- largest polluters of
Albany and that Corning is pro-

‘ibly personal friends with the
. nch of the company. He aus-
wered lhul. diesel motors cause

the meeting.

ted that “day care is more impor-
tant than a field house."

“A commitment means no-
thing;" said Dr. Seth Spellmnn,
assistant to the President in Social
Welfare,”the question is too com-
plex for a ‘yes‘ or 'no‘."

John Kaufman, a leader of the
New Left Organizing Committee,
charged the administration with
“dishonesty” in dealing with stu-
dent affairs.

Professor Ccile Duvid of Social
Welfare noted the “bills before
the current legislature to provide
more day care centers."

session ended with the

scheduling of a meeting of Dr.

members of Women's Liberation

Up against

the wall

by Mark Belkin

Students attending the President's news conference were expecting
President Kuusisln to malrc public the recommendations made by
Dean Perlmuller concerning the renewal of appointment for Gerald
Wagner. The students involved in the Student Power controversy were
prmnised thry would be informed of I’crlmulier‘s decision today.
President Kuusisln refused, however, to honor this commitment and
would not make public the Dean's decision.

The students were tired of wait-
ing and being detoured everytimc
they attempted to use the “proper
channels" for change. Jeff Wusser—
man. a student active in the move-
ment to save Wagner had previous-
ly arranged an appointment with
O'Rcilly and invited the concern-
ed students present at the press
conference to join him.

One hundred and fifty students
decided to converge on the admin-
istration building. The students
wanted Vice'Prcsident O'Rcilly
(who now had possession of the
recommendation‘s content).

During the first few minutes in
the Administration building it was
decided that Jeff Wasserman and
Richard Arrizo should be the
policemen for the students.

Bcfore entering O'Reilly's
office Arrizo told the students to
“be cool." Steve Berger, speaking
through a bullhorn, emphasized
the need for the students to “be
patient.” Many of those present
wanted an immediate decision.
One student shouted that waiting
for O'Reilly “is a tacit admission
that they have the power.” Still a
majority of the students did not
want to take immediate action
against the administration. The
concensus seemed to be that the
students should wait until they

could regroup and plan future
strategy for dealing with the
administration.

it was obvious that the issue
was now more than Gerry Wagner.
Bill O'Kain echoed the belief of
many students when he said, “the
issue is now Student Power, a
demand that affects every student
on campus." While the students
waited for Arrizo and Wassermun
to relay the information given to
them by O'Reilly tension was

growmg. A member of the Stu-
dent Power organization said, “We
want an answer today."A student
shouted out, “What if they re-hire
Gerry for a year?" Someone re-
plied, “That‘s to pacify students
for a year. We don't want some
bullshit tenure cat who’s busy
publishing instead of teaching."
The students seemed to feel pow-
erless since all legal efforts they
made were ignored by the Admin-
istration. Ed Shaw said, “Students
are treated like shit. They don’t
give a damn about us."

Finally the meeting with the
student spokesmen and Vice-
President O'Reilly ended. Wasser-
man told the students they were
only allowed to read two para-
graphs of Perlmutter's statement.
The statement recommended
“that Mr. Wagner be given a year
term, continuing his present salary
level,” and “since he is not fulfill-
ing the role he was assigned origin-
ally, that he serve during 1970-71
at the rank of lecturer.”

A few students felt it was a
partial victory but this was over-
whelmed by voices shouting "no
victory."

Dean Perlmutter's recommend-
ations could still be overridden by
Vice-President O'Reilly and Pres-
ident Kuusisto, although Kuusisto
has stated previously that he
would not “buck the findings of
the Dean."

Bob Norton, an instructor in
the department of Rhetoric and
Public Address and a close friend
of Gerry Wagner, told the stu-
dents not to take immediate
action against the statement. He
wanted the students to leave the
administration building because
any foolish action would probably
be harmful to Gerry. Norton
claimed that this concession was a
partial victory and “Gerry would
be happy" with the concession.

The fate of Gerry Wagner is still
unknown and the students still
have no legal channel for assuring
that their voice is heard.

The Student Power organizn
tiou is planning a meeting for
today at. 8 pm. The momentum
of the movement seems to be
growing and the students" deter-
mination is escalating. A student
suggested that the students are
“tired of being deceived by the
policies of the S.U.N.Y.A. admin-
istration in the same way the
Amerienn people are being de-
ceived by Nixon's policy of Viet-
numizntion."

The text of the paragraphs of
Perlmutter's recommendations re
leased to the press follows:

1. That Mr. Wagner be given a
year term, continuing his present
salary level.

That he be counseled and
assisted in the completion of his
dessertntion during this time and
especial attention be given to his
course load so that he fulfills his
obligations to himself and his
family.

2. Since he is not fulfilling the
role he was ussi ned originally,
that he serve (in ’ng 1970-71 at
the rnnk of lecturer.
