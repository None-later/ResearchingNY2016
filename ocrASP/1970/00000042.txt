Financial Aid
to he Reduced

All students requiring financial
aid for the coming academic year
of 1970-71 are advised by the
Office of Financial Aids to pick
up application forms at their car-
liest opportunity. As soon as Fed-
eral funding commitments are
made during the month of March,
Financial Aids will commence
making commitments to students
for the coming year.

The Nixon Administration, at
this point, intends to reduce again
the funds for National Defense
Student Loans. On a national
basis, NDSL monies were reduced
by thirty-five million between
1968-69 and 1969-70; an addi-
tional cut of twenty million ap-
pears imminent for 1970-71. Fin-
ancial Aids advises that students
write their respective Congress~
men.

Loan collections and student
attrition have permitted Financial
Aids to make some additional
National Defense Loans for this
Spring semester 1970. Eligible stu-
dents are advised to apply imme-
diately if their financial needs arc
not being met.

must stop talking and start doing.
Federal legislation has been de-
signed to protect polluters. The
air is filled with speeches and
vice-versa."

Ottinger then outlined his plan.
The most important step, he
stated, is to insist that the laws we
now have to be enforced. There
are enough laws on the books to
prosecute many polluters. Many
states are afraid that if they crack
down the polluters will leave and
go to another state. For this rea-
son. Ottinger would like the Fed-
eral government to prosecute.

Another important point of his
program is citizen action through
pressure groups and use of the
courts. Citizens stopped the
Stornt King hydroelectric plant
from being built. The plant would
have destroyed marine life in a
large segment of the Hudson. The
court made this a very important
ruling by saying that a citizen
group with no direct economic
stake in the matter can now go to
court.

Citizens also stopped the Gov-
ernor from filling in pttrt of the
Hudson for a highway. Ottinger,
along with Senator Nelson, has
proposed an environmental ubill
of rights." New York passed a
similar bill last year. He would
also like to see an agency of the
government set up to concern
itself with the environment.

Some members of the audience
doubted that the system of gov
ernment we now have can cope
with the problem. Ottinger feels
that with a “complete reorient-
ation of society’s values we cnii
clear up our environment."

He believes that "we can cer-
tainly provide the money that we
need to service." Some people
have their doubts.

Abortion Change

Proposed

by Susan Kellntan

The New York State Assembly
will have its annual confrontation
with the abortion question
shortly. Bills for complete repeal
and abortion rcform have been
introduccd by Constance (look
and Albert, Blumcnthitl
respectively. Much of the liberal
contingent (including Blumcnihztl)
is supporting repeal, but will
itcccpt. reform as a compromisc
solution if IICCI‘SSill‘y.

The major controversy facing
abortion legislation today, deals
with reform oi' the present law, as
opposcd to total rcpctd, of this
samc law. The prcsctti law states
that aborlion may bc performed

Under this bill abortion would be

saying that either all be tripped or
else no tapped person would take
the MYSKANIA oath.

In light of this statement,
MYSKANIA 1970 informed the
14 nominees before the ceremony
that all would be tapped. How»
ever, the import of this action was
not revealed to the audience of
near 150 persons who attended
the tapping.

The action was represented by
MYSKANIA Chairman Mathias as
a break with tradition, with no
mention of the constitutional
change necessitated.

The new MYSKANIA members
(in order of their tapping) are:
Mike Gilbcrtson, Sue Schwoitzcr,

 “llonlrnnt thtc Policy linkers”

by Liz Elsesser

In the tradition of last week‘s
press conference, the Patroon
Lounge was again left with stand-
ing room only. The issue this
week: the Gerry Wagner case.
Students demanded to know what
Dean Perlmutter's recommen-
dation was regarding the renewal
of Wagner’s‘term here. The pre-
sident stated that an lB-page re-
port was turned out by the dean
and was being reviewed at the
time by Vice-President O'Reilly.
To this there was angry hissing
and a very heated discussion be-
gan.

It was allegedly promised that

r the final decision would be reveal-

ed on March 9th as to whether or
not Wagner had been rehired.
However, the president announ-
ced that this has been moved up
to Thursday, March 12th. The
dudents were completely aghast
It this procrastination. According
to President Kuusisto, he would
not revoke the Dean‘s decision. If
no, the students asked. what does
O’Reilly have to do with it? And
if O'Reilly differs in opinion from
Perlmutter, wouldn‘t he be over-

The winners of the Class of
1971 were announced by Paul
Lieberman who deplored the race
this year as “disgusting,” in reiter—
ating that some traditions in class
elections are still vtilid. This was a
reference to the tradition that
candidates for the officers of the
class of 1971 should not campaign
since some were also running for
MYSKANIA.

ththcr campaigning was the
reason or not, the new officers for
the class of 1971 was an almost

stepping the President's authority
.in doing so?

The consensus of student opin-
ion was that "Vice-President
O'Reilly is hostile to
our cause." They did not feel,
despite reassurance from the Pres-
ident, that the Vice-President will
turn out a fair decision. And again
O’Reilly’s role was questioned.

' The students did not trust
O’Reilly nor did they recognize
his right to pass judgement in this
case. What they wanted was the
President's final decision and com’
merit immediately, not Thursday.

Another student attempted to
appeal to the President‘s feelings,
stating,“Administrators are more
worried about due process than a
human being." Kuusisto said that
he will “attempt to act exped-
iciously but will not make a de-
cision under such circumstances."

The circumstances he referred
to were the hostile remarks and
warnings that Were an integral
part of the discussion. Kuusisto
again stated that he “Doesn't like
the coercion present", to which a
student rcmarked,“You’d better
get used to it--there will be
more!"

Dean Perlmutter had listened to
student requests. The Students
want to make decisions in co-
operation with those around them
ttnd most of all be assured that
this situation does not recur. If
the University is a pluralistic com-
munity, the students should have
certain rights. This would imply
that the students make decisions
in conjunction with the adminis-
trators.

The students adamantly asked,
“Why can’t we see the recommen-
dation if it is available?" A little
more circumvention of the issue
and a little more name calling
took place and the circumstances
tad not changed nor had any
questions been answered satis-
factorily. Realizing the futility of
confronting Kuusisto and the cir-
cles they were talking in, it was
suggested that O’Reilly be con-
fronted personally. A disillusioned
student summed it up:

1, “Kuusisto is not going to
give us any answers."

2. “The real issue is 'whether or
not Wagner is rehired‘, the me-

tilllE Reorganizcs
For Spring llcloim

by Maida Oringher

The Committee for Undergrad-
uate Requirements Elimination
(CURE) aims to bring tibout the
elimination of all undergraduate
degree requirements.

Established iit October, CURE
had planned to mch with several
faculty members but was side~
tracked by two other proposals -
the establishment of a new degree,
and a program for departmental
majors. The committee, however,
has reorganized this semester and,
with the unanimous endorsement
of the Undergraduate Curriculum
Committee of the Faculty Senate,
plans to bring its program before
the Senate on April 20.

In order to inform the total
university population, CURE is
currently distributing publications
stating its policy. Opinion polls
will be held on April 15 through
April 17.

This new program would effect
the entire university not only iii-
coming freshmen. CURE hopes
for immediate action on their
proposal since “many students are
hinging their summer plans on
University action."

Open hearings are scheduled for
the evenings of April 7,8 and i1.

\Involved In this program are
Philip Cantor, Steve Villuno, Steve
Bookln, Susan Elberger, Aline
IApkln and Vernon Bryant.
