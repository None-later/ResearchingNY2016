CORRECTION

The Albany Sludeni Press wish-
es to correct a typographical error
which occurred in the Friday.
March 6. 1970 issue.

In the article I‘Bust and Near
Bust" by Al Sonia. the last two
paragraphs in the story concerning
Dutch Quad should have been the
conclusion of the State Quad arti-
clc.

It is reiterated thut no drugs
were found in the near-bust in
Stuyvosant Tower. Outside police
were not called in.

The ASP regrets this

since complications and misunder-
standings might hrer ensued. and
hopes no personal damage has
resulted due to this error.

With regards to the recent con-

Central Council to Prosecutc

MYSKANIA for

by Bob Warner

Central Council. which met last
night in the Colonial Quad flag-
room. voted (Sl-O-lO-) to prosecute
MYSKANIA 70 for attempting to
seat all fourteen candidates when
the constitution only permits
thirteen. Lenny Kopp. introducer
of the bill. was directed by
Council to plerrd the case before
Supreme Court.

Kopp's argument was entirely
based on the principle of the rule
of law over the rule of men. He
vigorously maintained that since
“we rrrc run under a constitution
ratified by the student body"
Council must always follow it or
elstI "anarchy" will ensue. He also
blasted MYSKANIA 7i for
“blackmailing” the present
MYSKANIA.

Kopp cited the oath by which
Councilmen swore to uphold the
constitution. saying that they
were obliged to defend it at all
times. As Kopp put it. this is a
purely legal question. because
emotions. though probably valid
in the MYSKANIA 7| petition.
should not interfere with the rule
of law.

Terry Mathias. a present
member of MYSKANIA. felt that
the incoming non-academic bon-
orary were right in petitioning the
present MYSKANIA to seat all
fourteen candidates because of
the “human element".

Drive Neufekl, rr member of
MYSKANIA 7|. felt that the case
should be brought to the )ourt.
but hopes it is defeated. He said
that human feelings are rrbovc the
constitution rrnd that the Council
should be flexible and not bound

to the constitution in every single
case.

The crux of the opposition was
that one person should not be
blackballed out of the entire slate
of candidates. This was felt as
cruel to the person who would be
excluded from MYSKANIA. It
would have been a “disgrace"or a
cut down for one person to be
excluded from the honorary. and
the other thirteen to be tapped.

All fourteen candidates insisted
that either all of them be admit-
ted to MYSKANIA or none at all.

The text of the MYSKANIA 7|
letter is as follows:

We. llrc fourteen candidules for
MYSKANl/l 1.071. cannol forge!
the Iranian clement involved in
the selection of candidates.
Tomorrow. after lapping. one

The University Council. the

Steve Brown. chairman of lln-

suggested that Council run buscs
for Easter or at least rcgulalc
ticket prices that are charged by
students who hire buses. A ques-
tion. however. was raised: if
Council did take up Brown's sug-
gestion. would Council attempt to
make u profit. off the student
body.

Dick Wesley said that Council
cannot tell what prices should he
charged. while others favored
Council's running the buses on a
non-profit basis. The ASP reporter
told Council that it would be
outrageous for them to make a
proﬁt off students who they rcp-
resentcd rrnd suggested that
Council go as frrr as to Sllbsldl'M'
buses for Easter and possibly take
a loss so that students mrry travel

Lenny Kopp said that next

Danes Down Brooklyn; Adams Scores 22

by Jay Marshall

The Albany State basketball
team ended its 1969-70 season
last Saturday night by downing
Brooklyn College 83-69. The vic-
tory boosted the Danes‘ record to
13-9 and marked the fifteenth
consecutive season that Coach
Sauers has had a winning record at
Albany.

Saturday's game marked the
last appearance in an Albany uni-
form for three Albany seniors.
Coach Snuers made a fine gesture
in giving reserves Jim Sandy. and
Ed Arseneau an opportunity to
start in their last grime. Captain
Jack Adams went out in fine style
by leading Albany scorers with
twenty-two points.

The game was close until mid-
way through the first half when
Albany ran off a 22-4 spurt to
take an eighteen point lead.
Brooklyn trimmed the lead to
410-28 at hﬂlf-tin're and came with-
in fivc during the second half. The

Wrestlers

The varsity wrestlers traveled to
I'lrrrpur Saturday to participate in
the SUNY Binghrrmton Invita-
tional Wrestling Tournament. 0f
the eight teams entered. State
finished fifth.

Albany had no individual
champions but line performances
were given by Herman Hilliard.
who took second place in the
bcavywcightdivision. and Jeff Al-
brecht. Jim Nightingale and Phil
Mims who finished fourth in the
142 lb. weight class. 158 lb
bracket and 167 lb division, re-
spectively. Albrecht was just beat-
cn out for third place by a lone
point.

According to Coach Joe Garcia
these guys did a “heckuva job of
wrestling” when you consider that
they had to compete in as many
as three matches during the day.
He explains that the fact that
these man never lnrd competition
for a starting position in their

respective weight classes because

so few came out for the team.
lendcd to their just running out of
gas by the end of the tournament.

Overall. the squad finished
3-8 for the season after a very
disappointing start. With the grad-
nation of only two men. Captain

Kingsmen who suffered a 2-22
season could not rebound with
Albany as Al Reid. Steve Sheehan.
and Jack Jordan controlled the
boards.

Perhaps the finest player on the
court Saturday was Brooklyn's
5-5 guard. Dennis Ozcr. The
Brooklyn captain penetrated Al-
bany's defense countless times
and made pinpoint passes which
his teammates converted into lay-
ups. He picked up at least ten
assists and could have had many
others. if his teammates had held
onto his passes. An excellent ball-
handler. Ozcr also scored fifteen
points in his last game for Brook-
lyn. There is always a place for
the small rnrrn in the game of
basketball. as demonstrated by
the play of Ozcr and Adams.

This game was Coach Sauers’
350th at Albany and his 237th
victory. Congratulations to both
the coach and the team.

toughest weight class. Nightingale
ran up an 11-8 slate. Mims. also a
freshman was 10-3. while both Al
Murcer and Tim Coons did credit-
able jobs in the 177 lb. class.
Finally. Garcia sees Hilliard as
the vanguard at what can indeed
be a very powerful team next
yerrr. “He is the best anchor man
that I've had in 10 years at
Albany." says the Coach.

I‘ottcr Club. led by Bob Rossi

respectively. Both boys are trans-
fer students and are sitting out a

had beaten Potter twice during the

In the League II ch'mpion-
