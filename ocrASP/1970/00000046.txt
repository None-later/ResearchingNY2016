MOODY BLUES To Show
Talents At March Concert

In 1964 at the height of the
rhythm and blues Craze, a group
from Birmingham took the British
pop scene by storm with their
second disc. The song was “Go
Now” and the MOODY BLUES
took it in triumph to the Number
One position. The Sunday, March
22 concert of Greek Week will
feature this group,

After “Go Now" two other
singles reacher the lower chart
regions for them. Then - nothing.

The turning point came in a
club in Newcastle. The boys were
rehearsing and didn’t really notice
the man who had come in to look
at the club’s air-conditioning
plant.

It was when they discovered
that he was a business man who
wanted to finance them and pro-
vide them with the equipment
they badly needed, that they sud-
denly became attentive.

"Days of Future Passed,"
their next album was a tremen-
dous success - and opened up a

whole new musical region as the
boys joined forces with the Lon-
don Festivnl Orchestra to fuse the
up between pop and the classics.
It all happened towards the end

of 1967 - and it was another
turning point. A 'single’ from the
LP, “Nights in White Satin,” took
the Moodys back into the British
charts. It reached our Top 20, in
fact, but soared on the coveted
Number One spot in France (and
stayed at the top there for 11
weeks), Portugal, Holland, Bel-

gium and Switzerland.

As before, the emphasis was on
music - and unique, progressive
ideas. And it was music made by
the Moody themselves. Not a
session musician in sight at any of
the recordings. When these five
can play more than 30 in-
struments between them, who
needs session musicians?

The group includes Mike Pin-
der, Graeme Edge, John Lodge,
Ray Thomas and Justin Hayward.

Annual Student Film
Festival Tonight

Albany State Filmmakers will
present the First Annual Student
Film Showing tonight at 7:30 in
Lecture Center 2. Sponsored by
the Art Council, the program will
feature nine 16mm films made
last semester in Dr. Lennig's Intro-
duction to Filmmaking course.

The movie story lines vary. A
young man mentally isolated from
society appears in Stephen Sulli-
van's film “Antique.” In “The
Marksman," Dave Riley handles
the situation of a man not in
harmony with the world. While

.the mild-mannered misfit in "An-

tique" is content to fumble in
Vicotrian dreams, the Marksman
takes out his frustrations with a
gun.

Audrey Kupferbcrg's "Foot-
bridge Home" and Walter Silver's
“You Eat What You Are” both
concentrate on food. “Footbridge
Home," telling the story of a
coed's 'nability to accept her
home and mother after spending
her first months away at college

Silver's film stresses the prepur
ation of a bizarre stew

Three eerie films have been
contributed by Rena Abelson,
Harold Arbit, a former film stu-
dent, and Douglas Stewart. Rena’s
untitled film offers an atmosphere
of witches, impressionistic natural
settings and love potions to relate
the tale of n deceived coed. Stew-
art's "7:18" captures the cmtiness
that faces every person when life
is no more. In “Juli,” Arbit‘s
actress portrays a young girl
troubled by a sexual trauma of
her childhood. Michael Ruther-
ford. also a graduated film stu-
dent, will present “Winter
Flower."

“Free Time," a film made by
Dr. Lennig, is included in the
program. The camera follows a
pretty Albany State student from
the tedium of class to the freedom
and beauty of the countryside on
a spring day.

Admission is free.

400 Police on 03 Campus:—

400 policemen were called on
to a calm Buffalo campus Sunday
morning by acting president
Regan to “protect academic free-
dom." Yesterday, they were still
patrolling the campus in groups of
20 or 30. A general strike is in its
eleventh day, organized by the
Strike Committee which is coordi-
nating the peaceful activities of
the strike.

The presence of the police has
mobilized and polarized large seg-
ments of the University commun-
ity and the strike is receiving
wide-spread support. Various dev
partmenls have endorsed the
strike and the student demand
asking for President Regan 's resig-

Shows Cities Short— Changed

by Donna Santora

Discriminatory distribution of
state aid to suburban localities at
the expense of our big cities
constitutes a basic example of one
of the gross inequities that faces
New York State today. In a re-
cently released study made by the
Mayors of the State’s largest
cities--Albany, Buffalo, New
York, Rochester, Syracuse and
Yonkers, the problem of unequal
allocation of state funds was
examined and studied by three
SUNYA economics professors:
Doctors Kuan-l Chen, Robert Pet-
tengill and Jagindar Uppnl.

Categorical state aid was found
significant in several fields-educa-
tion, general government, high-
ways, health, safety, social welfare
and "miscellaneous." These seven
areas served as the criteria upon
which the comparisons were made
between the cities and suburbs.

The UniVersity report made it
clear that all of the state's “Big
Six" cities suffered from a dis-
proportionate pattern of state aid
that substantially favored the
more affluent suburbs. As sum-
marized in the filial report, the
economists maintained that "state
aid to local governmean should
be in proportion to need, raised
where costs are higher and re-
duced where tax-paying ability is
higher."

The study further maintained
that “about hiilf the people in the
state live in its six biggest cities,“
but “much more than linlf of the
state's needy citizens dwell
there." It went on to explain the
urgent needs of our cities where
incomes are lower and rents are

higher than in the suburbs and
where large numbers of poor fami-
lies live in miserable housing.

In the cities, educational
achievement is stifled — schools
are more crowded, more expen-
sive to maintain, build and stuff
than in the suburbs. Health needs
are also proportionately greater
than for people living in the sub-
urbs, yet the suburbs receive the
larger share of the state's aid to
localities.

At the same time that needs are
greater in cities than in the sub-
urbs on a per capita basis, state
aid to city dwellers was found to
be much less. In 1966-67, before
the enactment of the special ur-
ban aid legislation, this was es
pecially true. The study pointed
out that then the suburbs of the
"Big Cities" got 2V2 times as much
state aid per resident as (lid the
people in the urban centers them-
selves.

The discrimination against the
urban areas became more appar-
ent when categorized ald by func-
tions was examined. The report
found that the suburbs of the big
cities got 16 times as much aid as
the cities (lid for health services. ii
times as much for highways, 5
times as much for miscellaneous
expenses and 2 times as much for
education.

The problem 01' education was
found to be in a class by itself.
Expenditures in the field were by
far the largest burden for city
taxpnycrs, amounting to nearly
50% of the total tax burden in the
"Big Six" cities in 1966-67.

Half of this educational ex-
pense was borne by city residents

    

     
 

and half by the state budget. For
suburbs, however, the report
found that the taxpayers "shoul-
dered only 114% of their school‘s
costs, the state taking care of 56%
- another case of discrimination
against the cities and an expensive
one!”

In short, the urban areas of the
state need more financial help,
not less. The conclusion reached
by Professors Chen, Pettengill and
Uppnl gives the cities a meaningful
incentive for joining ranks and
continuing the battle for fairer
allocation of state funds. For
now, more than ever, the cities
have a reason to come together as
they have never really done be-
fore. to demand it!

Buffalo, New York--
(CPS)--While most of the nation’s
attention has been focused on
Santa Barbara, students at the
State University of New York at
Buffalo have battled police on
campus and boycotted classes.

The worst disruption in the
University’s history was the result
of a Wednesday night (Feb. 25)
sweep through the student union
building by club-wielding campus
police. Two students were beaten
and taken into custody in the
lobby of the crowded building as
police allegedly were pursuing
vandals who had tossed a rock
through the President‘s window:

Within an hour cityvre-inforce-
merits, including the Tactical Pa-
tro. Force, arrived to vacate the
building where incensed students
had thrown up barricades and
destroyed windows and furniture.
A three hour battle on the campus
grounds ensued. Seventeen arrests
were made and several injuries
were reported.

A noon-time rnlly Feb. 26 cul-
minated in a march by 1000
students to the administration
building, but Acting President
Peter F. Regan was not in his
office. The crowd then moved
through the campus, hurling rocks
at the Clark Gym headquarters of
ROTC, burning a truck at the
Defense-Department-sponsored
Project Themis construction site
and smashing a campus police car
into the Security Offices building.

students asked, “Who has the

Throughout the afternoon mum
of student police demonstrators
confronted cordons of city police
in full riot-gear but there were no
arrests.

Molotov cocktails were hurled
at the building housing the Facul-
ty Club Thursday evening. The
ﬁles of some alumni and incoming
freshmen were destroyed by a
blast at Admissions and Records:
three shelves of books were
burned in the library basement
and the English Department an-
nex was firebombed. Scattered
incidents of property violence and
large strategy caucuses took place
throughout the weekend, in ad-
vance of a University-wide strike
meeting on Monday. Classes were
boycotted Friday. By Saturday
morning Feb. 28 the police had
withdrawn from campus.

What provoked the recent inci-
dents was the physical presence of
police on campus and not, as had
been reported in the commercial
press, the boycott by the Black
basketball players. It was that
boycott which resulted in a dem-
onstration Feb. 24 on the gym
court before the Buffalo/Stony
Brook game. The campus athletic
program has been under attack by
Black athletes since the start of
the year. The players say the
program is unacceptable, charging
racism, and some have boycotted
the basketball team all season
demanding a renegotiated pro-
gram. Police were called in, the
gym was cleared, but there were
no confrontations. Several police
broke windows as they exited
from the building, and a Univer-
sity official overheard one officer
remark: "You may have won this
time, but wait till next time."

Many of the issues which be-
came points of contention in last

year's rebellion-ROTC, Themis,
tenure, open admissions, self-
determination for students-mm no
nearer resolution than they were
12 months ago. In fact, many
have been bottled up in commit-
tee for nearly that entire time.
Four out of the six demands from
March 1969 are repeated in this
year's list of nine.

Among the new additions are
the call for Dr. Regnn's resigna-
tion and the abolition of the
campus police.
