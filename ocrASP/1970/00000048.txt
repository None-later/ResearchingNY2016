Rubin at SUNY Buffalo;

Describes Chicago Eight Trial

by J . Stephen Flavin

The indictments
charged eight with crossing state
lines to incite riots and “con-
spiracy" riots. The charges should
have read "corrupting youth. on
dangcring their morals and influ-
encing thcir thoughls,”

Jerry Rubin, of (‘hicago (ionv
spiracy fame, cxplaincd, “the l-l of
us exposed American justlcc for
what it is . . . injustice, that, was
our crime. bringing thc Bugle to
the surface."

Over 10,000 students, faculty
and members of the Buffalo com-
munity heard Jerry‘s account of
Bobby Scalc's attempts to defend
himself. The fact that Scale, who
was in Chicago for only two
hours, was indicted proves lhut
the “courts are integrated."
Sealc‘s lawyer was stricken and
needed a gall bladder operation to
save his life, so Bobby Scale asked
for a postponement of the trial.
Hoffman denied the petition on
grounds that Bill Kunstler could
represent Bobby. Bobby demand-
ed to be allowed to represent
himself. He was told to sit down
and remain silent.

When a witness testified contra-
ry to Bobby‘s knowledge of the
truth, Bobby called him a liar and
demanded his right to cross-

exuminc. When Bobby persisted,
Judge Hoffman ordered Federal
Marshalls to bind and gug Bobby.
Bobby could be heard mumbling
through the gag so his mouth was
taped. Bobby managed to break
loose of the tape and demanded
his right to be his own lawyer and
cross-examine the witness! “It was
impossible to silence Bobby. The
Pigs' technology is not equal to
the power of the people!"

"Bobby"; image of being gagged
and chained was representative ol'
all Blacks in the U. S. Bobby's
image was comn‘iunicatcd across
the world, it publicized racism in
the U.S. 'l‘hc govurnment could
not allow it to go on!" Bobby was
ruled in contempt of court, re-
manded back In jail, and awaits
trial on a murder charge in (Jun-
ncclicul. Jerry urgcd the people
to join him to “save Bobby's lil‘c,
any way we can."

the four ‘liberel‘ jurors that-“mm:
promised behind closed doors to
reach guilty verdicts.’ These four
'libcrals‘ undeadlocked the jury to
gct home to their families. The
'cal danger is not from right-
wingcrs but from ‘liberals' who
conspire and give in. They are our
real cncmics. Vietnam is a ‘libc-
rnls" war, blacks are being put
down by ‘libcrals' we arc not
liberals. we are revolutionaries. We
must ﬁnd meaning in our lives.“
America has destroyed our lan-
guage. The word revolution was
cited. Revolution once only rc-
fcrrcd to Cuba, or the Chinese
Cultural Revolution. Now there is
u “revolution in toilet paper, a
revolution in bud-breath. Madison
Avenue has destroyed or taken
over our language-Fuck is the
only word we have left." Let‘s not
overuse or abuse what's ours to
make it trite! “The only real
Obscenities are in the courts, Viet—
nam, and in Julius Hoffman."
‘Thc most oppressed people
are high school students. They are
forced to compete, hate, and
work for money. We don‘t. want a
career. our career is our life!
Heaven is on earth, we don‘t want
diplomas by Christ, school, or
lloffmun. We don’t want to work
to retire at 65--wc want to retire
when we are born." This is a
struggle of "Brotherhood, Com-

, ‘ﬁ‘lt’ieshlp, and Tog'etherness versus

a system of fear and competition.
The problems in society are
caused by capitalist ideas of self-
ishness and wanting."

Jerry believes the Chicago 8
“were stand-ins for all of you. The
establishment can not stop the
revolution by stopping us--you all
will back us!"

Jerry‘s summary spoke for all
the people in tune with his think-
ing. "We are the majority, “we are
the young people, we are the
fixture!“

views between the two groups.

At 8:45 Dean Perlmutter arriv-
ed at the student sit-in. Perlm-
utter admitted that he was respon—
siblc for Kendall and Colman get-
ting copies of his unedited report.
He said, though, that the recom-
mendations were vital and hoped
that they would be released.

The first part of the report had
some confidential information
from students, according to Perl-
mutter, and that is why he didn't
want it made public. Students did
not seem placath by this and
asked “Why can it be made public
to Kathy Kendall and Dean
Colman and not to Gerry
Wagner?"
