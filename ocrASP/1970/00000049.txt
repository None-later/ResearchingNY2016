The Roar Of The Greasepaint -
Journey To The Beautiful Land

by Mary Eileen O’Donnell

Experimental Theatre and Mu-
sic Council presentTHE ROAR
OF‘ THE GREASEPAINT--THE
SMELL OF THE CROWD next
Thursday and Friday, March 19
and 20, in the Arena Theatre of
the Performing Arts Center. There
will be two performances each
evening at 7:30pm. and 9:00

pm.

GREASEPAIN’I‘ is a Leslie
Bricusse and Anthony Newley
musical that enjoyed a successful
Broadway run in 1965 with An-
thony Newley and Cyril Richard
playing the lead roles of Cocky
and Sir. The musical popularized
such songs as “The Joker" and
“Who Can I Turn To?"

Directed by Ron Abel,
GREASEPAINT is Experimental
Theatre's first full—length musical.
The cast includes Michael Rey-
nolds and Mary Eileen O'Donnell
as Cocky and Sir, and Frances

Caruso as Kid; also appearing are
Douglas Saucke, Ralph Boone,
and Barbara Muller. The seven
Urchins are Suzanne Norton,
Ellen Cooper, Deborah Levy,
Ronnie Massin, Margaret
O'Connor, Jacquelyn Rossi, and
Tobi Shostak.

The dance numbers in THE
ROAR OF THE GREASEPAINT-
-’I‘HE SMELL OF THE CROWD
have been choreographed by
Kathleen O'Neill.

Originally designed for theatre-
in-the-round, GREASEPAINT
adapts well to the PAC Arena
Theatre. The musical is a bitter-
sweet conedy of the constant
put-down of Cocky by Sir in the
game of life, the perennial struggle
of the underdog against the Ex<
tablishment.

Auditions for YOUR OWN
THING, directed by Joseph Bal-
fior, will be this Sunday, Monday,
and Tuesday, in the Studio Thea-
tre of the PAC, at 8 pm.

‘Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots?
F aiIsWhere Others Succeed

by michael nolan & diana dalley

The LAST OF THE MOBILE
HOT—SHOTS has a fine cast,
James Coburn, Lynn Redgrave,
and Robert Hooks. It was pro-
duced and directed by Sidney
Lumet who has among his credits
the Pawnbrokcr. However if the
film were being reviewed for tele-
vision the review would probably
sound like this; Good cast unable
to overcome script.

HOT-SHOTS, based on Ten-
nessee williams' play, The Seven
Descents of Myrtle, had an ill
fated run on Broadway with
David Merrick and was subjected
to a rewrite by Gore Vidal before
it came to the screen.

The discrepance in Vidal's and
William's styles can easily be seen

by comparing Myrtle's (Lynn
Redgrave) and Chicken's (Robert
Hooks) dialog. Evidently Vidal
left Myrtle alone while rewriting
all of Chicken's part. Whereas
Myrtle's speech is that of a lower
class, self educated wretch that we
have come to know as a Williams
character, Chicken‘s speech is
filled with vulgar jokes about sex
and his color.This kind of un»
subtle, disgusting characterization
could only come from a perverted
mind such as Vidal‘s. The fuel

are incoinpatable didn‘t seem to
bother the men upstairs who saw
the combination in the green tinl

must have read the script iirst.
The point is that Mr. Hooks is a
relative newcomer, looking for
that first big break. Miss Redgrave
and Mr. Coburn are trying to re-
capture the appeal they once held;
neither has had a big picture in a
long time. After all it's a money
world and on the surface HOT
SHOTS sure looks boxoffice. It
has a black man in bed with a
white woman. (Twice, in case you
miss it the first time.) It has flash-
back sCenes in black and white
just like Midnight Cowboy. (For
the pseudo intellectual film cri-
tics.) It has Three in a bed; dirty
language; and impotent white man
and a stallion black man. It even
has James Coburn's naked bul~
locks. (For the lags.) But most
important it has an X rating

Shoot Horses Shows
Direct And Powerful Acting

by Tom Quigley

Using simplicity and directness

the year. The time is the Ameri-

can depression of the thirties but

this story of humanity is universal
in scope.

The depression ushered in an
era of social and financial despair
that left no American untouched
and no illusion undented. The
American people, who clung to
the vestiges of their dreams, were
faced with a world of harsh im-
mediacy that could leave them
homeless one minute and starving
the next. Survival, therefore, be-
came the national pastime.

Momentary diversions were in
abundance and cheap during this
period.

One of the most popular but
little remembered of these ex-
capist events was the marathon
dance. These dances pitted cou‘
pies against each other in an en-
durance test that promised easy
money to those who could fight
off physical exhaustion the long‘
est. Pollack expands the micro-
cosmic world of a dance marathon
into a macroscosmic metaphor of
struggling humanity and its relent-
less pursuit of happiness and satis-
faction.

The contestants are obviously a
hand picked group of (lissolutcs
however these potential stereo»
types ncvor manage to be any‘

thing but real, a credit to the
superlative cast who enact their
miseries. Jane Fonda, who in the
past has constantly demonstrated
her ineptness for portraying any-
thing that calls for dramatic pro-
jection, fools everyone and deli-
vers a terse, venomous portrait as
Gloria, the sometimes bit actress,
who stages a last ditch effort to
gain respectability by securing the
prize money.

Michael Sarazzin plays Robert,
Miss Fonda’s partner, with all the
incredible bug eyed, bucholic
charm of the innocent youth
syndrome. He would seem like
naivete personified if it weren‘t
for that one stupid expression
frozen upon his face for the (lur-
ation of the film. One wishes he
would blink occasionally.

Red Buttons as the aging sailor
and Suzunnah York as the l-larlo-
wesque actress on the skids are an
admirable pair of flotsam and
jetsam lending credible support.
The film's major performance is
given by Gig Young as Rockcy,
the verbose impresario, who acls
as M.C., director, (lemon, tor
mentor, and housefathcr to thc
contestants. Young's maturing fa:

Philip Lathrop's sharp photo
graphy graphically captures llll‘
pain and desperation etched into
the faces of every contestant us
well as observing thc spcclaliirs
who relish the spectacle. Pollock‘s
only major flaw is the
graphini, of the finale by abruptly
cutting into film al lin-
inopportune moments. Otherwise
he has fashioned a movie of un
usual power and morality.

Polliick's film is an
whelming vision of wciirincss and
tawdry dehumanizalion. 'I‘hc con
testants are cxploitcd for the lien

Image At Albany Concert

The Rascals—Felix Cavaliere,
singer and organist; Eddie Brigati,
singer and pert-ii ioiiiriazi; Gene
Cornish, guitarist; Dino Danelli,
drummer—have seen some fantas-
tic changes since their formation
in February, 1965.

They're no longer “The Young
Rascals" for one. And they're out
of choirboy shirts and knickers
into four separate, strong, search-
ing personalities.

  

New experiences for the Ras-
cals: a feature-length movie, a TV
special, books of poetry, books
about art and the story of their
own lives and career, new pro-
duction companies, European and
Far Eastern tours merchandise,
more work with kids...and still
more changes...

The Rascals music goes deeper
now, is more lyrically wise—
speaks about revolutions and
hopefulness and needs The Ras-
cals know well. Music that brings

together jazz, blues, folk-rock,
Nashville echoes, Oriental in-
fluences. Its sounds vibrate

through you, make you move,
then change something inside
your head. Storming, driving, pro-
claiming, peace-making sounds.

It's music The Rascals com-
pose arrange, produce, perform
(and publish) themselves.

The story of The Rascals‘ be-
ginning is slapstick, clipped out of
a Keystone Kop Chase Scene.
Picture the four of them before
the whirlwind began—in New Jer-
say, in New York, in Las Vegas—
and then some-fate-how meeting
and binding forces in 1965: Gene,
joining The Rascals after leaving
Rochester and his own group;
Dino, after playing drums with
jazzmen in New Orleans and New
York; Felix, coming from a pre-
med course at Syracuse and a stint
as organist for “Sandu Scott and
Her Scotties‘," Eddie, after work-
ing as a singer in New Jersey clubs
and as percussionist with Joey
Dee‘s Band.

Their first date was in Eddie's
hometown, Garfield, New Jer-

ning f'i‘i’iying, sailing times-
things couldn‘t stop happening!

At their next booking, The

stein, impresario for The Beatles'
Shea Stadium appearances, de-
cided The Rascals were the one.
to manage...the two forces met
and have moved like wildfire ever
since.

One record-breaking appear-
ance after another: selling out in
Hawaii in seven hours...turning
away crowds at the early Phone

before SRO audiences...touring

up...

The recording togetherness (on
Atlantic) started immediately:
singles like “I Ain't Gonna Eat
Out My Heart Anymore,“ “Good
Lovin‘," “You Better Run," “A
Girl Like You," “How Can I Be
Sure," “It’s Wonderful," “A
Beautiful Morning,” “People Got

"Heaven" and currently, “See.”

Young Rascals" (on the trade
charts for over two years), “Col—
Iections," '" "Once

 

 

“Groovin ,
Upon A Dream," “Time/Peace”
and now, “Freedom Suite."

‘Groovin"‘ (authored, like
most of The Rascals' hits, by
Felix and Eddie) was voted the
top record of 1967 in the national
trade polls and earned The Rascals
a Gold Record- in addition to the
six other Gold Records they‘ve
received for “Good Lovin',“
“People Got to be Free," “The
Young Rascals,’ “Collections,”
“Groovin,” (LP), “Time/Pence”
and “Freedom Suite."

And The Rascals grow on. Mov-
ing with chaotic times...

Last summer they performed at
a housing project in I’Iar-
lcni...”Strcet soul," someone said
while they played. The kids
bounced and the older people just
stared and wondered through the
concert without moving or mak
ing a sound. The Rascals are very
much with the world now, realiz-
ing the job is harder, the search
deeper. Changes. It's like begin-
ning all over again.
