FRIDAY, MARCH 13, 1970

 

Well, they say it happens every
spring. The baseball season is just
around the corner and the Albany
State Varsity Baseball Team is
eagerly awaiting its arrival.

Coach Bob Burlingame lost
three top flight players in Jack,
Simott. George Webb, and Dave
Wheeler but looks for the able
veterans Jim Sandy and Rich
Spiers to provide the punch for
this season’s squad. Sandy. an
outstanding catcher with a win-
chester for a right arm. can hit
with power to all spots on the
field. Rich “Dickie” Spiers. a tall
righthander with a sharp fastball,
plays the outfield as well as pitch-
es.

The infield seems to be intact
with lettermen Steve Flood re-
turning at third, Tom Brooks at
short. Elliot Nirembcrg at second.
and Rich Bardechewski at first. In
the outfield. Spiers and Jim Lee
are returning. with the remaining
spot up for grabs.

The pitching staff seems to be
balanced with righthanders Spiers.
Rocco Pekich. and southpaws
Hyland Dolittle. Rich Bar-
dechewski. and Howie Smith.

Up from last year's frosh mum
and expected to provide help are
Jeff Sirpperstein. Rod Dunbar.
and Mark Simonctti.

This spring. during Easter vaca-
tion. the team will make a South-
ern trip; the first prolonged trip of
this sort by any team in Albany
State history. The team will play
games in Annopolis. Maryland;

Take me out to the ball game.

Richmond. Virginia, and Char-
lotte. N.C. before returning home.
There. a lngame engagement
with the tough Southern op-
ponents should provide a good
tuneup for the coming season.

forward to his second winning
season.

This year‘s team looks strong
after only one week of offical
practice. Promising members of
this year‘s team include: Sprints:
Basil Morgan. Marty Amerikaucr.
Jay Parker. Field events: Bob
Iseman. Don Van Cleve. Dave
Siegal; Distance: Ken Stringer. Joe
Geoco. Sal Rodriguez. Dennis
Hackett. Larry Franks and Bill

Overall the team should be a
threat to the opposition and
should fare well this season.

The first meet of the season is
April 15. against Boston State at
home.

Albany State's varsity tennis
squad coming off the first un-
defeated team in the school’s Iris-
tory and a NCAA tournament
appearance have a rugged 111
match schedule facing them. Ad-
ditions to the schedule inelude
Central Connecticut and Mont-
clair State. plus the dropping of
Utica College in favor of Union
College. The key to the team
success will be the ability to re-
place last year's number one mrrn
Ron McDermott(9-l) last year by
moving last year's six returning
lettermen up one slot. They are
returning lettermen captain Dave

Ted Rosenberg 9-1 at «1th; Ross

combined for a 6-3 at the 6th
spot. With the new NCAA ruling
which makes freshmen eligible for
varisty the team will bavrI a JV for
the first time. Uppcrclassmcn will
be eligible for JV as well as varsity
competition as are the freshmen.
The prospects look bright. the
desire and dedication is there. and
the team should be ready to start
a highly successful season on April

FRIDAY. MARCH 13, 1970

Dawson Candidate

For Socialist Party

by Neill Shanalian

Imagine the junior senator from
New York turning over all the
resources of his office to the
anti-war movement-all the mail-
ing privileges. all the facilities of
reaching a mass electorate.

Imagine the state controller re-
fusing to sign any major checks
until the people had been consult-
ed directly. Imagine him using the
monies available to establish free
medical care.

Imagine a party engaging in
elections with the understanding
that such an electorate is a fraud
and betrayal of the people.

An idea is afoot that repre-
sentative offices and elections for
those offices hrive degenerated to
the point of mere popularity con-
tests. “Elect me and 1 will do
this!" “Elect me and I will do
this!“ ‘Elect me and the war will
end!"

’I‘weedledcedum vs.
deedee?

Kipp Dawson is running for
senator-11 candidate of the Social-
ist Workers Party along with Clif-
ton cherry. the candidate for
governor. She has been on campus
this week-speaking before 40 or
50 students Monday evening. at-
tending student power meetings.
appearing in local media and seek-
ing support rrand campaign Work-
ers. Her appearance was arranged
and sponsored by the Young
Socialist Alliance.

She put it this way in her
speech:

‘Therc is one concept which
drives us. the one which defines
where any political party or indi-
vidual stands today. and that is
where they stand on the principle
of self-(letermination--not in the
abstract but on the principle of
sclfAdctcrminrrtion as it is being
fought for today around the
world and in the US.”

She is running on the idea that
despite the peace candidates of
the big parties. and even because
of them, the sytem of political
and social organization in this
country cannot be reformed. It
must be revolutionized.

Where the profit motive is parrr~
mount. where industrialists and
monopolists have relatively free
reign and great influence in the
government Vietnams must sure-
ly occur despite the pecgle's (le-
sire.

“Doesn‘t Vietnam raise ques-
tions about the myth of American
democracy." she asked. "Doesn't
this mean that the US. govern-
ment is not really what it is
decked out to be? Doesn't this
illustrate clearly that the decisions
of oirr government are not based
on what the people of this coun»
try or the world wrint and ItL‘l'(l.
but on something clsc'.’

“I submit that what is happen-
ing iii Vietnam answers these
questions clearly. The reason that
the US. government has turned
such terrible force against. tlit'
Vietnamese struggle for self-deter
mination is because that struggle
threatens to the core the iiitcrcsts
not of the vast majority of the
people of Vietnam or the US. but
the interests of those whose
wealth gives them the power over
the lives of the majority in this
World."

The question DaWson is raising
in her campaign is this”. Are the
wrrr. the suppression of blacks and
Chicanos and Indians rrnrl \vonicn
aberrations in the system? Do thr-
problems he with tlit' corruption
of the men we have elected to

representative offices--or do they
ﬁnd their fault in something deep-
er?

The system itself?

That system is defined by the
Socialist Workers Party and its
afthe Young Socialist Alliance as
an exploitive one-~that in which
those happen to have money con-
trol those who don't.

--thut in which even the family
with two cars and a huge house
must sell its labor and must de-
pend. therefore on those who
buy and use that labor.

Kipp Dawson campaigned for
John Kennedy in 1960. She now
runs for senator-- not really to win
the office-but to build toward a
socialist revolution in this coun-
try. She has been radicalized. as
John Froines noted of so many
activists. in the last ten years. She
now envisions and is working
toward a new society organized
not around an elite. but around
councils organized on the basis of
jobs and communitiesvcouncils
with the power to discuss and
decide how the economy will be
run and with full power to elect
and constantly recall representa-
tives to a central. national council.

--To give people a voice in the
decisions of war and peace. the
direction of the economy. the
institutions to which they belong;

Universities without the hold of
the administration

Communities which recognized
their own needs.

A judicial system in which the
I‘Ioffmans and Carswells and
Haynesworths are unknown.

A nation without class or cth~
nic antagonisms.

How?

By 100% tax on incomes oVer
$251100 and no tax on incomes
under 9510.000

By 100% tax on all war profits.

By freeing the Panthcr 21

By A High School Bill of Rights
and decentralized schools with
community control.

By student-faculty control of
the universities.

By an end to the draft.

By building the anti-war move-
ment in the streets this spring.

Kipp Dawson is focusing most
of all on the last point. Without
the war's end--nothing. That is
why. although she will certainly
not win the senator’s office. her
measure of success will be quite
different--

How Big the Movement!

but he thought that the bill
should hirve undergone revision.
Firstly. the bill did not specifical-
ly say that only undergraduates
should serve on the departmental
committees. etc; DiMarino feels
that graduates cannot View the
faculty and administration in the
same perspective as under-
graduates. Anothcr point that he
scored was that students called for
no higher appeal. which can only
hurt them

The second bill to be con-
sidered. introduced by Bert
Evcrsley and Drer Neul'eld. was
concerned with Gerry Wagner.
The bill which was passed 20-0-2
declared that Council supports:
“Immediate notification to be
given to Gerry Wagner concerning
his term renewal. Dean Perl-
mutter's original unedited report
(to be set) along with the official
notification (which should) be
sent to Gerry Wagner."

The argument for this bill was
that Wagner should certainly see

and his life if the RPA Chairman
Kathleen Kendall has seen it. This
is no mere rationalization .how-

The day started peacefully. but
.loon degenerated into another
day of violence. Reports from the
SPECTRUM (SUNYAB‘a paper)
Indicated that the police might
have left as early as this after
noon. but “that's highly doubt-
ful" now.

The students started with a
rally in the Student Union. From
there they marched to Clark
Gymnasium, where city police
have been based since they were
called on campus.

At the Gym the students held a
“War Dance" or “War Council."
They also burned a U. S. flag and
taunted police. Ice. and some
rocks. were thrown by students.
Among the injured were reporters
from the campus newspaper and
radio. Some Gym windows were
broken. then the students
marched on project Themis. a
Department of Defense research
project. Students broke down the
fence surrounding the project and
marched through it.

Police then chased kids from
'I‘hemis to their dorms (about Va

, I mile), then started to retreat. Stu-
ever; the princrple at stake was that dents then circled m Hayes Ha”

K-9 corps vans had been parked

Gym. These headed for Hayes at
full speed.

The students. at last report.
were milling around. unsure of
what to do. if they did any-
thing. Note: apparently every
city police car has been ordered
on campus. At least seven arrests
were reported. Both police and
stuttean were injured; some are
being taken to area hospitals. All
