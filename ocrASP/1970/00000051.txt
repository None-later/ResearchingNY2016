Strike?

Strikes are for real. Revolution is a very serious
business. Charades and games lead nowhere except

to individual ego trips.

The “program for change" adopted by Central
Council at their Monday night meeting is hardly a
platform for signiﬁcant institutional change. Under-
lying the resolution’is a basic misconception of
power. Power is created by people organized in a

cohesive manner. Power is never

people who have it. If you want power, you must
create your own and then proceed to legitimize it.

50% student representation on committees, even
powerful committees is not student power. We, as
students, are not here to be administrators. What we
don‘t need is more shit work. What we do need is
ﬁnal determination of the policies which affect
students However. this does not mean we need to
be engaged in every level of committee organization.
(‘ommitlccs are anti-student and anti-human and

can not be used as a vehicle for effective studcnt

power.

There is a lot wrong with the university. The

students, where it belongs, but neither is it in the
hands of the administration. A concession from the
administration won’t save us. The problem is some-
thing much larger. Their power is beyond our virgin

walls. The power is in University Council, the

campus rats

Dear Sirs:

The rottenness perceived by
Prince Hamlet so many years ago
seems to perpetually substantiate
itself on this campus. The anti-
capitalist rot spouted by certain
“revolutionaries” is caste to hell
so that in true capitalistic fashion
the combined sum of $4000 was
paid to bring Kunstler and Buch-
wald “to the scene." In addition,

Central Council unilaterally
decided to pay the gym rental for
Kunstler. $4000+ was paid so that
6000+ people could “SEE” the
magic lights emanating from the
famous men of our era.

Was Kunstler's speech so very
excellent or significant? The
March 7,1970 New Yorker maga-
zine carried an article which stat-
ed everything Kunstler did, and
more, and it only cost 50 cents.
You saw Kunstler raise his fist,
but do you see the children who
hold one fist against an empty
stomach and extend the other in
the air in defiance? Kunstlcr‘s
group probably feasted in the
Patroon Room; his poor spt-ccb
must. have been due to llitiIﬂL‘S‘
tion.

Oh, sure, l know about Campus
(,‘hest week and that “Smile on
Your Brother" bit but why illlVi‘
the smiles stopped? Will (fen-
tral Council allot $4000 in sin
dent ttix monies to underprivi-
legcd children? No! But it will
allocate $75,000 for rock concerts
for next year according to stupor
-l.ooper'i. proposed budget. The
t’itlini' people complain that $5“!

You're goddamn rtglit it is!

A rat is a atrnngtl animal, but ll
doesn't require much. A growing
child needs much - most of all he

 

  

needs love, but he also needs
food, and clothing, and toys. So
in a few weeks when you 6000
rats cash out to see the Rascals,
the Moody Blues and Canned
Heat, think of a child dying in
Albany from malnutrition, or
pneumonia, or lack of desire to
live. But then again, rats don't
think of people.

on residence

To the Editor:

Despite what Jackie Schwartz
would have us believe, RA's and
directors are not power-hungry
people. It borders on the absurd
for the ASP to print such a
libelous generalization made by a
person who has never lived in a
University residence ball.

If Schwartz would take the
trouble to sit down and talk with
some directors and RA‘s, and
listen to what they're saying, he
might be in for the profound
revelation that they are concerned
with helping people, not with
putting them in jail or with exert-
ing some sort of domination over
them. But, that is part of the
problem: Schwartz is in a kind of
one dimensional world where he
only sees and hears what he wants
to see and hear. lie is fundament-
ally incapable of seeing mori- that
onc side to a person or a situation.

There are many unfortunate
consequences, both for ltA's and
their t'cllow students, of the Uni-
versity's drug policy. Yet every-
one seems to be losing sight of the
fact that one of the purposes of
that policy is to prevent the pre-
scnct'. of undercover narcotics
agents on campus. What we are
saying to the police is: this is our
problem and we will handle it
until drugs are actually found
there we will turn the situation
over to you. if the University
followed a policy of complete
non-cooperation with the BCI, the
place would be crawling with
many more undercover narcotics
agents than there probably al-
ready are on campus.

Yours in peace,
Michael Gilbertson

To the Editors:

The UniVersity of Buffalo's
campus is in a struggle. Police are
now regularly patroling the cam-
pus. The faculty and students
have demanded that President
Rugan resign. Practically no clas-
ses are being held because the
students refuse to attend. Stan-
ford UniVersity (California) has
telephoned a vote of confidence
from its student body to UB‘s

student body. State University
College at Fredonia students are
on a sympathy strike. What is
Albany State doing? As usual.

nothing.
Bill Kunstler was here last
week. Was there any student

body vote of confidence for him?
Any moratorium on classes for a
day in sympathy for the Chicago
7? Anything at all? As usual,
nothing.

if you hnve noticed, the land-
scaping going on between the Bio-
logy Bttilding and the Performing
Arts Center then you might ask
“How much is that costing." They
are supposerl to be building a
garden. Rumor has it that it might
cost as much as $300,000.

Wake up!! Albany State. Apa-

To the Editors:

There is more to be said about
Nixon‘s National Defense Student
Loan cutback than was indicated
in the ASP on March 10, page 2.
Not only are loans to be withheld,
but the Work-Study program, also
financed by the federal govern-
ment, is being seriously curtailed.
The number of jobs available for
this year was already reduced
from last year. but as if that
wasn’t enough, another reduction
has been made, effective now.
Twenty students have been re-
leased from their jobs, and all
other Work-Study'students have
been cut down from fifteen to ten
hours weekly.

Because of Nixon's infamous
veto, the situation will be even
tighter next year. This informa-
tion I obtained from Mr. Whit-
lock, Director of Financial Aids,
and from the notices I have re
ceived while at my Work-Study
job. Mr. Nixon's disposition
towards education has been plain-
ly demonstrated before this, and
it is time he be enlightened. Write
to your congressmen iind Sena-
tors. Write to Mr. Nixon. Bitch!
’I‘he ABM is not worth the money
taken away from education.

THE WEEKEND OF OUR DISCONTENT

by Vicki Zeldiu

The unexpected announcement
that Gerry Wagner would not be
rehired by the University sparked
the call for an emergency meeting
of students last Friday night.
Utter disbelief was visible on the
faces of many of the students as
the news spread and the crowd
gathered in the Campus Center.

From the original meeting place
in the Fireside Lounge, the

meeting adjourned to the ball-.

room where students let off some
steam.

Those students that had been
involved in an administrator-
faculty, and student meeting that
afternoon were perhaps the most
disillusioned. Part of the content
of the meeting was the possibility
of establishing a Forum to deal

   

Saturday morning— the morning after, and the party's over.

with elucidating and airing the
recent campus issues. After the
Wagner decision, however, the
general consensus was “fuck the
Forum." Students felt that the
hastily set up meeting was an
attempt by the administration to
appease the some 100 students

that were milling about the
Administration Building that
afternoon.

Many of the 100-150 students
who were in the ballroom felt that
the rest of the student population

must be informed as to what the H

administration htid done (namely,
fire Wagner) and what it had been
doing all along (lying). At this
point most of the students, some
banging tin ash trays, decided to
sweep the quads and rally the
other students to their cause.
After going to all the quads the
students, now some 300-360

  

strong, marched through the Cam-
pus Center und out towards the
Administration Building. Between
entering and exiting the Campus
Center, the number of students
dropped to about 200.

Vented Anger
As they marched towards the

building banging their self-
-invented instruments, they
chanted, “2-4-6-3-fuck in the

streets and smash the state" and
“no more shit, no more shit."
Once upon the building only a
very few of the 200 persons
actually contributed to the
damage. At the sound of a police
siren the majority of the students
scattered.

Seeing no police or security,
they reassembled between the
library and the Social Science

'building. Here they attempted,

Dialogue Set to Facilitate

University Communication

by (‘arol Hughes

Acting President Alicit Kuusislo
is (“\Ill't‘lt'li to officially announci-
today the cancellation of 'l‘hurs-
day and Friday classes for an
‘opcning up' of the University.
'l'ht- cessation of classes is intcnd-
Oil to free all mcmbcrs of the
university community for an act-
ive participation in a program of
meaningful dialogue.

The dialogue is planned tlti ti
‘posilion plan to educate people',
according to Jeff Wiisserintin, one
of the leaders of the activity. lt‘ree
conunuiiicntion between repre-
scntutivcs of the entire University
community will hopefully lend to
dcl'initc suggestions for the
imprnvumcnt of our present situa-
ttoii Sccurity police, maintenance
personnel, secretaries, us well its
students, teachers and administra-
tors are strongly urged to partici-
pole.

The library is the tentative lo-
cation ol‘ the discussion since it

seems most. conducive to com-
munication in small groups. Par-
ticipants will be able to freely
choose the direction of their talk
sincc innny diverse groups can go
on simultaneously. The objective
of this easy atmosphere is to
completely gcl awtiy from any
structure, pressure, or coertion.

The organizers of the program,
tl rapidly expanding group, hope
to continue 'ditiloging‘ from 0am
Thursday to 12am Friday. This is
not to achieve some marathon
talking session, but rather to pro-
vide a continuing opportunity for
individuals to participate.

'I‘wo desks will be set. up in the
library to provide central organi-
zation and service to participants.
An information desk will provide
answers to any specific questions
brought before particular groups.
A second table will be set. up to
accept all suggestions for improve-
ment from individuals or groups.
Eventually these suggestions will
be eoulutod and published.

A mimeo depiirtinent will pro-
vide free service to any in quickly
comntunicutiong special ideas to
the other groups. How is support
to he solicited for this unusual
program? Students and faculty are
risked to personally urge others to
participate. Free communication
entails this kind of personal con-
tact iind publicity.

A general meeting will be held
Friday afternoon to bundle any
questions, issue any strong recom-
mendations, and perhaps even
cnuct some resolutions introduced
in the dialogue sessions.

Maybe this is what it university
should be', stressed Wusscrmtin.
The. dialogue has met with an
overwhelming positive response
since the need for communication
has been unruly felt in the past
few week. The whole University
cun ‘opon up' and respond to the
problems facing us. As Wussermun
put it, ‘perhtips it can make us
into a community'.

though not too successfully, to rip
down the fence that was enclosing
the area designated as one of the
much disputed sunken gardens of
the future. Unable to do much to
the fence, a few students pulled
out sticks and proceeded towards
the library.

At the library several students,
from different factions, spoke to
the approximately 100 remaining
students. The speakers con-
demned the students for running
away and reminded them that
security now knew that they only
had to sound a siren to scare
them. By this time, the library
had been closed, and the students
that had been ejected from there
and curious passers-by were added
to the ranks.

Strike!

The students then returned to
the ballroom where much talking
and yelling ensued. Some men-
tioned that the window-smashing
had proved nothing. Others felt
that it showed the administration
how upset and frustrated they
were over all the duplicity and
lying that the students encoun-
tered.

Cries from the audience, that
numbered about 300-350, were
for a defining of the issues and a
defining of the leadership. These
questions were answered by a
variety of students who were near
the microphone. Factionulism was
evident, both in the leadership
groups that spoke, and in the
views they presented. Althouin
the views all hit around the same
general topics, no clear definition
of the situation was established.

Finally ll group of students
voluntarily formed an ad hoc
steering committee to help clnrify
the issues. This committee, with
about 40 students present,

Frlday afternoon at the

haggled for several hours. Finally,
those not on the steering com-
mittee were asked to leave, and
were told that if they wanted to
they could voice their ideas and
views through written messages.
Sometime between 2:00 and
3:00 a.m. the committee returned
to the ballroom and addressed the
remaining students concerning
what had been accomplished.
Quiet Saturday

Saturday, the Ad Hoc Steering
Committee of 12 students met in
a semi-closed meeting. At list of
19 demands had been drawn up.
Several faculty members were
present and after wallowing
through extensive debate Jeff
Smith, an instructor from the
Anthropology Department, took
the meeting into hand. It was
agreed that Paul Ruffer, a student,
and Louis Liebermanhun
instructor from the Sociology
Department should rewrite the
demands so they could be
presented to the University com-
munity with a minimum of misun-
derstanding and a maximum of
clarification.

Paul Mann from the University
College spoke to the committee
and warned them that if the
movement and the leadership
were not supported by the Univer-
sity community they would be
charged with an elitist attitude
and with having their owu
“personal ego trips." He said that
us the movement stood at that
time it was nothing more than an
“autistic revolution."

in addressing the group, Jeff
Smith stated that some action
must be taken. “Action leads to
an ideology.‘I l-le inferred that.
there must be some kind of action
