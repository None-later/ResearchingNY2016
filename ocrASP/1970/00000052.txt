Checks

by Kathy Eckerle

 

The Faculty-Student Associa-
tion has recently changed the
check cashing procedures at the
campus Center. This was due to
the financial loss suffered because
of the return of many "bad"
checks. Most of the checks were
made from one student to another
from checking accounts that were
closed or had insufficient funds to
cover the checks.

Under the new procedures.
only checks under a fifty dollar
maximum limit. instead of the
usual limit of one hundred dollars,
will be cashed. Also. the check
cashing service will no longer
accept three-party checks.

Teach-in

by Joe Slack

There is infinite talk about the
critical state of the environment.
April 22nd may be just some
more talk, or it could be an
environmental teachin. A leach-in
goes beyond talk. PYE has been
working on the teach-in and has
developed the following goals:

1. There is a tremendous lack of
public awareness concerning the
environmental crisis. The teach-in
shall involve the people in the
state of the world.

2. Concerned people need in
formation. The teach-in will be a
start towards making information
available to people so decisions
affecting the environment may be
made intelligently.

3. Concerned and informed
people need courses of action.
The teach~in hopes to provide
some courses of action by which
people may affect a change in that
which presently destroys our qual
ity of existence.

Thursday, March 1‘.) there will
be a meeting in L. C. 23 to get
people to work on the leach-in.
People with beautiful idcas and
strong bodies please attend.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

No ClaSses Thursda

by Bob Warner

The University Senate yester-
day overwhelmingly passed a reso-
lution proposing "that the Univer-
sity be ‘opened up‘ Thursday and
Friday of this week for the pur-
pose of dialogue." This resolution,
if accepted by Acting President
Allen Kuusisto. will close regular
classes on those days to allow
students to participate in the dia-
logue.

The rationale of the resolution
was that this was probably the
best way to curb violence on this
campus. As one student put it.”lf
this bill isn‘t passed, we are all in a
lot of trouble.“ Nearly every sena-
tor agreed. though. that it would
be worthwile to cancel regular
classes for such a purpose. thus
dissipating mistrust and hate
among the administration. faculty
and student body.

Before the Senate took action
on the resolution sponsored by
Professor Mauritz Johnson, Presi-
dent Kuusisto addressed the Sen-
ate and a group of about 150
students.

CURE Proposes an End to

Undergraduate Requirements

Last Spring, a proposal to elim-
inate the general undergraduate
degree requirements at SUNYA
was presented to Faculty Senate,
after having been reviewed and
approved by the Curriculum Com-
mittee and Undergraduate Acu-
demic Council of the Senate. The
proposal was tabled. primarily be-
cause it lacked a plan of “imple-
mentation" and needed proof of
significant support throughout the
University community. The Com—
mittee for Undergraduate Re-
quirement Elimination has under-
taken to supply the imple-
mentation plan which was called
for. and is circulating this plan,
along with the original proposal,
to gauge the degree of support

lor of Arts degrees:

(1) The Bachelor of Arts

(2) The B. A. degree is the
liberal-arts degree. and stresses
general preparation in prefer
ence to specialization.

(3) Of the semester hours in
this degree. at least 75% must
be in the liberal arts and scien-
ces.

(2) The B. S. degree is the
degree permitting special-
ization under stress on prepar-
ation for a specific vocational
objective.

(3) Of the semester hours in
this degree. at least 50% must
be in the liberal arts and scien-
cos.

Kuusisto. heckled and yelled at

by students quite often, called the

events of the last few days a
“crisis of the first order." He also
called for “a lot of soulsearching"
becauSE“the university is now
greatly polarized.

The President made reference
to the incident Friday night where
twenty-five window panes were
broken in the Administration
Building. He said, however, that
there were no personal injuries.

A Senator asked if those who
broke the windowa would be pro-
secuted. Kuusisto said that al-
though no one has been identified
yet, he does intend to have these
people prosecuted if and when
they are identified. He said that
the university itself does not of-
ficially have photographs of the
offenders. but did not deny that
others might.

Kuusisto was also attacked per-
sonally for his actions during the

ast' weekend. One student
said,“l‘low can we believe a man
who has proved himself to be a
liar.“ Another student asked why
Kuusisto didn't follow Dean Perl-
mutter‘s recommendation reap-

pointing Gerry Wagner as it lectur-
er for one year. Friday night.

Kuusisto had issued a statement

upholding the original decision of
the Department of Rhetoric and

Public Address.

Kuusisto replied that his act-
ions. while possibly contradictory.
were not made out of malicious-
ness or ill-will. but had merely
been a matter of judgment.
Kuusisto also said that O’Reilly.
Acting Vice-President of Aca-
demic Affairs. played a large role
in the decision.

Concerning Clara Tucker of the
History Department, Juusisto said
that action is forthcoming shortly.
Dr. Peter Krosby, History Depart-
ment Chairman, has already rec-
ommended favorable action on
Tucker.

The following is the text of

’ senate Endorses ' Dialogue

y& Friday

In other business, the Senate
propoaed that the physical educa-
tion requirement. for the Class of
1973 be limited' to. only one year.

In a bill introduced by Senator
Jack L. Schwartza. Senate pro-
posed that “if requested by ten
members of the University Com-
munity, any individual on campus
for the purpose of recruitment
shall be subject to a public hearing
on campus to answer questions
pertaining to his intent and pur-
poses."

In a bill introduced by Jack
Schwartz and John Reilly, Senate
recommended that all personal
records remain “totally confi-
dential" except to the student
involved.

The Melville-Steinmetz Pro-
posal for Coeducatiunal Living
was passed in accordance with the
recommendation of “the creation
of sanctioned coeducational hous-
ing."

The Senate brought up the
problem of deplorable salaries for
graduate assistants at Albany. Ac-
cording to Dr. Krosby of the
History Department. Albany is far
behind the other three state uni-
versity centers in its stipends. The
teaching assistant salary here was
estimated from $2200 to $3400.

The Senate also brought up the
possibility of curtailing its own
power in taking political stands,
the rationale being that it was
never intended that Senate have
this power.

Later that evening. Central
Council passed the same resolu-
tion as proposed by Professor
Johnson in the Senate. cancelling
regular classes this Thursday and
Friday in order to open up a
dialogue. President Kuusisto had
promised earlier Yesterday to ap-
prove the idea if the Senate and
Council passed it, which both of
them did overwhelmingly. Council
also appropriated money for dia-
logue, (12-74).

Fired

matter, and to assure due process.
has taken so long. in justice to
everyone, however. the review
simply could not be done other-
wise.

At some time in the very near
future 1 intend to issue a report
on this matter. Some questions,
however. we are honor bound not
to answer because we must re-
spect the rights of individuals.

After a careful review of all of
the material that l have available.
1 find that the procedures fol-
lowed by the Department of Rhe—
toric and Public Address were fair
and anticipated the spirit of the
recently issued University Senate
Guidelines for Student-Faculty
Consultation. I find no reason not
to accept the Ilcparlmcntul recom-

mendation that Mr. Wagner not be
reappointed to unolher term in
that Departmenl. ll should be
clearly understood by everyone
that this in no way implies any
reflection on Mr. Wagner as a
person or as a teacher.
I have sent a personal letter to

Mr. Wagner telling him of my

decision. I will release this state-

ment after ho has received my
letter.
