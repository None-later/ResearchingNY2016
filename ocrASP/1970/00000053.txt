John Mayall is an artist.

This seemingly unnecessary
statement of the obvious is never-
theless a ﬁtting one with which to
bégin any evaluation of Mayall,
and of his unique role in modern
musical history.

Mayall probably would have
succeeded in any area of the arts
that might have attracted him.

Benefit Concert Held At The PAC

Is Deemed A Social Success

by Beth .lo Knapke

Last Friday and Saturday night
the University Concert Band pro-
vided the most exciting perfor-
mance of talented young men and
women in order to raise money
for the underpriveleged children
of Albany and the Capital Area.

The program opened with three
selections which helped the
audience recognize the quality of
good musicians. The last of the
three sparkled with a glorious
combination of dancers and rock
selections from Hair. This im-
mediately made the audience re-
spond with clapping to the music.
md the whole theater was filled
with spirit. The selections follow-
ing the opening were charming as

well as mysteriously beautiful es-
pecially “In the Manner of Han-
del" and “In Taberna Quando
Sumus" which consisted of a
splendid blending of voices and
percussion. Findlay Cockrell and
Dennis Helmrich played magnifi-
cently. and he presentation of
two players made Chopin even
more appealing. The finale of sin-
gers. who made the selections
from West Slde Story. My Fair
Lady. Carousel. and the Sound of
Music so very like the originals.
was highlighted with the somber,
resounding voice of Marjory Ful-
ler who approached each peice
with freshness and versatility.

The program was very well or-
ganized with the changing of sets.

Talent Call
*ﬁﬁﬁﬁﬁﬁrﬁ'ﬁ'

Because of the increasing
amount of talented students on
campus. the Ad-Hoc Committee
for the promotion of Student
Talent was formed. The purpose
of this committee is to act as a
liaison between organizations and
talented students and student
groups seeking jobs to perform on
and off campus.

The idea to form the commit-

tee came from the tremendous
response of the students who per‘
formed in the 1969 Telethon. In
addition, the Student Activities
Office receives several calls during
the week requesting a wide variety
of talent. Besides off-campus re-
quests new on-campus program
ming will result in a greater de
mand for student performers.
If you are interested. pick up an
information sheet in Campus Cen-
ter 36-]. Groups will be notified ol
a short meeting within the next
few weeks. If you have any ques-
tions, please contact Norma Israel
at 457-7718 or Sandy Kloinman
at 457-7702.

After studying his album design
and art work, he went to art

He launched his first gorup. the

was not until 1963 that he took

simple. to everyone understan-
dable, thought. Because acting.
from time immemorial, is the very
drive for the seemingly endless
survival of the animate, which or
who. is still alive now; and be-
cause acting had always been a
resultant product of an ultimate
decision among choice of alterna-
tives brought about under a cer-
tain status quo. in a certain
moment - that is why the empha-
sis ought to be placed equally on
timeliness, which in the case of
acting is being expressed by the
NOW.

Recently. many of the world‘s
outstanding scientific minds,
which is some cases had pre-
viously been utilized for produc-
ing such necessities of civilization,
as atom missiles, are coming out
with their honest warnings. ad-
dressed to all of humankind. not
yet realizing exactly, in its modest
ignorance, the dangers of the total
destruction and extinction of an
individual human being.

One, who is most distinguished,
is the Soviet scientist Andrei D.
Sakharov. being known to the
world's public, as the father of the
hydrogen bomb, and as one of the
Russian intellectuals resolutely
opposed to the totalitarian and
imperialisticpolicy of the Soviet
leaders. He is the author of a book
entitled Progress. Coexistence and
Intellectual Freedom. a book
which has never been published in
his own country. His manifesto,
addressed to the entire mankind.
is indubiously more that simply a
criticism; it is an amendment; a
premise for avoiding a disasterous
end to life.

The book was published in
1968 by the New York Times
Company. It contains a brilliant.
introduction, afterwork and notes
by Harrison E. Salisbury.

In the years since then, his

ments of any of his contempor.
aries. He has displayed his gifts
not only as a guitar, piano. bar
monicu. tambourine and mouth
percussion expert, but as a com-
poser, lyricist and talent scout.
Among the blues and jazz soloists
who have passed through the
Mayall ranks is Eric Clapton. who
with Mayall in 1966 set. a patlcrn
and started a whole generation of
modern blues guitarists.

If paying does is virtuous Inert
John Mayall deserves charter
membership in the angel‘s club.
For too many yenrs than he
would care to remember. Mayall
has inhabited a unique no man's
land and that. is the music busi-
ness.

Mayall is recognized as one of
the prime forces in the British and
American blues renaissance. Un-
der his tutelage of many of
England‘s most prominent blues
musicians developed styles that
were to eventually propel them
into a limelight that Mayall him-
self had never experienced. Eric
Clapton, Graham Bond and Peter
Green are alumni of various edi-
tions of Mayall's Bluesbrcakers
and it was with a touch of irony
that Clapton remarked recently
that “John Mayall is finally get-
ting the reeognition he deserved
all along."

Mayall’s keen car was re
sponsible for the selection. in
1969. of three exceptionally well-
qualified sidemen for his group:
John Mark on acoustic finger style
guitar, Steve Thompson on bass
guitar. and the remarkable Johnny
Almond, who plays at least a
dozen instruments, most notably
snxophones and flutes.

Mayall‘s oblivion was not total
for although general audiences
were unaware of his contribution.
this was not the case with his
fellow musicians. Wherever he
went he was mobbed by his peers
and his habit of jamming with
whomever was "in town" led to
tales of after-session sessions that
are unequalled. All this is is the
past. however. as John Mayall is
no longer a performer whose
records are filed in the "assorted"
bin. A highly successful American
tour. an album (Blues from Laurel
Canyon) and a return tour of the
states have finally provided John
Mayall with tho fruition ol' his
labors.

At. a time In our socicly wlu-n

The Second Time Around 

The mod. the masses. the music. and the madness that were Woodstock. Michael Wadleigh, lower righi.'made ilie ﬁlm. Included are
(clockwise from upper right) Richie Havens. Sly Stone. Arlo Guthrie. and J can Baez.

Woodstock. that unforget-
.able celebration of love. peace.
md music that has earned its
place in the vocabulary of a
generation and a nation. has
made it to the motion picture
:creen, It was inevitable. Film is
the medium of the Woodstock
generation.

Capturing those three re»
markable days of mud and hap-
piness that scented to speak for
all the youn at one time in one
place, "Woodstock" is a film by
Michael Wudlcigh that was pro-
duced by Bob Maurici- for
Warner Bros. release. The
Wudleigh-Mnurice Production is
in 'l‘echnicolor.

Some of the great musical
performers of our time bring
their unique artistry to "Wood-
stock": Joan Baez. Arlo
Guthrie. Richie Havens, Jimi
llondriz. John Sebastian. Sly St
The Family Stone, Joe Cocker.
Ten Years After. Country Joe
and The Fish. Santana and
Crosby. Stills. Nash 8: Young.

They are all at the top of
their form: appearing before an
audience of half a million young
people breings out the best in

any performer. The result is a
fantastic unity between perfor-
mer and audience such as per-
haps will iichr occur again.

But at least the equal of the
performers are the young peo-
ple who made up the crowd,
doing all their things in their
own special way. To capture
Woodstock on film required 20
camera crews, operating under
the direction of Michael Wad-
leigh. the young film-maker
who previously had made a
reputation with “No Vici-
numesc Ever Called Me Nigger."
“David lIol'Lmun's Diary" and
milms of such musical perfor-
mers as Aretha Franklin and
James Brown.

Painst‘akingly edited to then-
tre-going length from 120 hours
of film. "Woodstock" is not. an
attempt to explain or analyze
what happened there. It doesn't
discuss the Woodstock gener-
ation. nor does it offer any
preachmenls or speeches. All
that “Woodstock” iii—“for
those who were there and for
those who were not—is what
Woodstock was.
