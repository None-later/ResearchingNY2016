Co-op Power
To the editors

What is Stydent Power? Co-
operation and respect among the
members of this university? If so,
will the 50-50 representation ad-
vocated by the self-acclaimed Stu-
dent Power groups make the ad-
ministration respect the students?
I think notlj. The administration
may grant such a representation
on all committees but will do so
in the context of giving a baby his
pacifier.

Power is influence - ability to
have one’s views respected and
interests furthered. To gain it,
however, one must have an aware-
ness of being. a knowledge of true
needs. Student Power at SUNYA
doesn't know itself, for it lacks a
soul. It receives little support
from the student body because!
those who have cried out for it in
the past do not appeal to the
majority. and so the majority re-
mains uncommitted to the con-
cept (n.b. uncommitted not apn-
thetic.

Student Power is not Student
Pacification. but student respect.
Student Power can't be them-
selves and before any action is
done the students must realize
that their interests are at stake.
Student Power is not "Power to
the People" but “Power to all the
People." Student Power is co-
operation of all the members of
this university in the improvement
of the quality of education.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,
Charles Sullivan

Air Demands

To the Editors:

WSUA would like to indicate iit
this time that we support the list
of twenty-one demands deter-
mined by the Student Co-
ordination Committee...as well as
the central issue of self-determina-
tion by students. We feel that the
demands with only one possible
exception (number five which the
State Government controls and
which the University can do
nothing about) are well thought
out and will be workable with
some effort on the part of admini-
strators, faculty. and students.

There are four of the points
which we feel are especially im-
portant to all of us—Numbcr one
says the. definition of a University
Department is to include student
majors as well as faculty. Since
the quality of education of a
student for his time here at the
University is governed for the
most part by his major depart-
ment, this demand. we feel. will
help to guarantee students the
best possible education.

Number seven. that Campus
Security officers undergo in-
service training programs to make
them more sensitive to current
student issues and that students
would be involved in campus se«
curity making seems a reasonable
request and one which might
make security considered more of
a servic and less of a nuisance...

Thirteen calls for investigation
of FSA by an independent
SUNYA committee with student
participation to determine how
profits are being utilized. Students
have been kept in the dark for the
most part about how this corpora-
tion which affects them so much
actually operates. it's about time
they found out. We've heard
about corruption within this car-
poration. and if this estate. we
want to us it exposed.

COMMUNICATIONS

Finally, number nineteen is
probably the one we feel most
strongly about—that the entire
SUNYA community be required
to carry out the faculty HPPI’OVedj
decision that students are.to parti-
cipate in all University Eommit-
tees. reafﬁrmed by faculty vote in
Winter, 1969. This is to be ex-
panded upon by noting that: the
proportionate composition of the
department committees should be
determined by a consensus of
students and faculty in that de-
partment. The proportion of all
other committees should be ap-
proximately 50-50.

This is the crux of the whole
student power issue. We want to
have a say in the manner in which
this University educates us. By
being represented on a 50430 basis
on all committees in the Univer-
sity. we will be able to take part
in determining the direction in
which this University. our Univer-
sity, moves.

WSUA also feels that number
twenty-one. which requests am—
nesty for students involved in the
incidents for Friday the 13th.
should be granted automatically
by the administration.

Sincerely.

Right On?

To the Editors:

Congratulations psuedo-radieais
of SUNYA! On the fateful night
of Friday the l3th the bullshitting
psuedo‘radicals of SUNYA
"took" over the ballroom for a
whole half-hour (in fact the whole
rebellion lasted two hoursi). The
Establishment sounded the fire
alarm and the angry militant oc-
cupants filed out quietly! of the
0.0.

A lot of changes are going to
take place...morc together teach-
ers (3 so far) are going to get
fired. control of the University
will be solely Administration. and
students are going to continue to
be “niggers” to the institution.
(Talking about togetherness)—we
only haVe ourselves. the students
who care. students who are tired
of being subjected to iissinine
rules and regulations because we
have finally revealed ourselves as
super—cool bullshit artists.

To you. dear “radicals” l ex-
tend my congratulations rind
sympathy for being such Estab-
lishment prick-suckers!

Speak Up!

To the Editors:

Unquestionably there iirc many
problems facing students today
that must be resolved. ideas iind
help in solving the problems of
the university iind the world are
needed from all our students. Yet,
while everyone has an opinion on
the various issues. few bother to
make them public. Most of those
that do care enough represent
several close knit groups on the
political left. Holding a clear cut
majority at many political discus-
sions such as the one held Monday
in the Administration Building,
they have the appearance of re-
presenting the student body.

These groupx generally present
just one opinion and will use
whatever methods they want to
achieve the changes they want.
While in the majority at such

discussions they are quick to stifly

minority opinion, intimidate
whoever stands in their way, and
threaten goon squad methods.
Certianly changes are needed, but
these should be more or less
evolutionary. not revolutionary.
Some of the methods of the leftist
groups may well need modifica-
tion. Yet if the apathetic students
representing various other interest
don't make their feelings heard at
demonstrations and confronta-
tions this situation will not be
remedied; relatively small groups
will take drastic actions in the
name of the student body.
Students whether moderates,
conservatives or radicals, should
participate in such events so that
the actions of student groups will
represent the attitudes of the stu-
dent body as a whole and not just
a small but active segement of it.
Perhaps then demands placed on
the administration will more ac-
curately represent the true needs
of the student body. If the apa-
thetic continue to allow a small
segment to make all their deci-
sions they have only themselves to
blame for the consequences.

Student Role

Dear Sirs:

After being quoted in the
March 10 issue of the ASP. I feel
an explanation regarding my state-
ment (ie. “students are treated
like shit") is in order.

Students. in my opinion. mean
very little to this or any other
university. The fact that they do
not have the letters plid following
their names and can not claim to
be distinguished lecturers in one
field or another relegates them to
a position of nothingness. Because
they lack. such credentials their
presence on campus can in no way
bring to the university that quali-
ty which it so desperately seeks:
prestige. From the administra-
tion's (our's as well as iill other
college administrations) viewpoint
the only difference between us
and Stone‘s pillars is that we have
student numbers and the pillars
don't.

if students did matter to a
University.thcir opinions would be
solicited as to the quality of their
professors. After all. who is best
able to judge a teacher‘s worth
than those people who are being
taught? it goes without saying.
that student opinion is not now
risked for regarding their profes-
sors and is blatantly ignored when
given. For those of you who are
familiar only with Jerry Wagner. 1
can remember Waterman and
Rhodes last year mid David Hiir-
vey the year before that.

if students did matter to a
university their opinion would be
asked for regarding the environ-
ment in which they live. How
many of us were ever consulted as
to the proposed field house or the
future expansion of the university
across Fuller Roiid'.’

if students did matter to ii
university they would have ii any
in the courses they choose to
study. Why not- it is your educa-
tion isn't it? Similarly. teachers
would not have the ridiculous
threat called cut policies - three
cuts and you're out - if students
mattered. if i choose not to at-
tend a particular class the loss is
my own and not the professor's

in conclusion there is no reason
why students should not have a
meaningful siiy with regard to
matters which directly affect their
lives - from professors. to trees to
day care centers.

Sincerely.
Edward Shaw

     

Awakened

To the Editors:

The cries of “Student Power”
and “Power to the People" over
the last few weeks at S.U.N.Y.A.
have successfully ended my state
of limbo in the apathetic “Silent
Majority." The forces active on
this campus in favor of reform
have stimulated in me a renewed
sense of responsibility to the true
priorites of a university education.
It is tragic, however, that my
response to these stimuli is totally
negative. The reforms I might
wish to see implemented have
been forsaken for petty policies
and a mere disguise for a host of
irresponsible actions.

I often question exactly whom
the Student Mobilization Commit-
tee et. al. represents? As far as I
have perceived. they represent a
small number of students interest—
ed in promoting or better super-
imposing a value structure on a
student body who never asked for
reorientation. Gerard Wagner is no
issue here. He never was. He only
represents a tool by which the
“New Left” can better poison the
atmosphere with their per-
suasions.

Exactly who do they fool in
requesting fifty-fifty representa-
tion in administrative positions?
Not only are students unqualified
to be administrators. they. over a
course of time. would resort to a
similar system in present use re-
garding the tenure of faculty. A
small group of students in such
positions would have no more
insight in all the issues involved
than does the Administration at
present. What is needed is not a

 

political restructuring but a sys-
tem of new priorities of university
education. It is conceded that the
present system is harmful for the
student in pursuit of knowledge
since the faculty is bound by
bureaucratic trivia, yet it is abso-
lutely essential that such change
be effected only through responsi.
ble actions.

This nation has existed for ap.
proximately 200 years on the
theories of compromise and social
contract. The nation only stopped
functioning when reason broke
down and a series of demands
became our working criteria. The
same analogy will be drawn to this
Univeristy if the true representa-
tives of “Student Power" allow ii
minority of students to pressure
their lives under the threat of
strike and other irresponsible acti-
vities. The nineteen broken win<
(lows in the Administration Build-
ing are far from effective persua-
sion. Those responsible have po-
larized the issue into two camps
where effective dialogue is beconi~
ing a fleeting reality. Far more
serious is the inconvenience and
infringement on the rights of their
fellow students, those who they
claim to represent.

Never will their point of view
be equated with democratic acl~
ion. It is minority rule without
respect whatsoever to the wishes
of the majority. Perhaps if the
“New Left“ took the time to
evaluate the position of their
"compatriots," they might find
themselves well advised to wave
their battle flag outside foreign
soil.

Respectfully yours.

Fairy Tale

lnhabiting this kingdom were thousands of sheep and a few foxes who

The goal of this kingdom was

to let each sheep become all he is

Eventually a group of wandering sheep with radical tendencies

Everyone was upset. The lower animals were angry. Even the goats

Crap
rl‘o the Editors:

In response to a letter by M.
Gilbertson, which was an attempt
to uphold the high esteem of RAs
and dorm directors, I rely on the
opinions of those students who
are residing in our dorms. The
RA. and directors may not be
ego-freaks, they' re pigs. To turn
in a fellow student for such bull-
shit as the present drug laws de-
serves reprisal from the victims.

As far as the other crap in the
letter is concerned. how does he
know whether or not I have ever
lived in the dams? Personal exper-
iance supports my view that an
RA who is trusted by students is
the rare exception to the norm.

I also recommend that Gilbert-
son read some more Marcuse be-
fore he bastardizes such terms as
"one-dimensional."

After the recent actions of
dorm staffs on campus. I can see
that if the job of an RA is to
prevent the presence of narcs or
campus, (there aren't any?) their
actions are much more ludicrous
when they lead students to believe
that they are to be trusted. and
then turn them in to the cops
when they are confided in!

This is undoubtedly a case of
lack of self-determination; resi-
dent students should run their
own lives even inside the dorms.
without fear of searches. seizures
or snooping pigs disguised as RAs

and dorm directors.

Rhetoric

It‘s SO easy to understand!

It’s because of white liberal

talk but never move -- because
we're so goddam comfortable on
our split-level asses.

It‘s becasue of wall—frat-street
types who yell “Bring in the state
troopers if they get violent." and
“Fuck it! If they don’t like it.
kick 'em the hell out!"

It's because of level headed.

Try Unity!

To the “Student Body”(Wherever
it may be),

I have been to two major meet-
ings concerning the relations be-
tween "student body," faculty
and administration. Both meetings
turned out to be hours spent
shouting. clapping and inter-
rupting, and the only concrete
conclusion I can draw from them
is that there is no such thing as
the “student body.” I would have
gotten to the point they are now
in is that we as students are not a
united group capable of initiating
and implementing action in our
own behalf.

So whose voices have we been
hearing in this educational vacu-
um? Well we have Student
Power. the New Left. Student
Mob., Women’s Liberation Front
and Black Power to mention only
a few.

Where is the Student Body?
How can students negotiate with
or make demands upon an admini—
stration if they as a unity iire not
a reality? if we cannot address
ourselves as ii student body to the
problems we as students now face.
there will be no one to maintain a
dialogue with the faculty and ad-
ministration, and. just as im-
portant. no-one to shoulder the
responsibility that ii 50% student
say in the workings of the Univer-
sity will incur.

i say to those students who are
splintering any real efforts toward
communication that no matter
what group your sympathies lie
with. you are first and foremost

students. May I suggest that those
who insist upon viewing them-
selves in the current situation as
representatives of a particular con-
cern and not as students are sup-
porting the administration by in-
capacitating the only real offens-
ive at our disposal, united effort
by students interested in their
position as students.

if there ever was what may be

termed a Student Body at this
University. there is not one now.
What we need is one voice that
can say to the administration. "1
want" and. through the power of
its individual students joined to-
gether. guarantee that it will be
heard. Will we get it?

The Confused Majority

Why do the vast majority of students feel that
they have every right to either pack up and go home
chncsday afternoon or spend Thursday and Friday
catching up in their reading, writing term papers. or
sleeping blissfully until noon.‘Thc reasons appear to

bc twofold.

First. the rapidly changing events confused the
majority of students. Central Council gave legiti-
macy lo a Thursday strike: air illegitimate group of

If you are a member of the confused and
disgusted majority, we can understand your desire
to take full advantage of the shutdown, but we urge
you to remain on campus. Go to the meetings;

for a Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday moratorium and
a Thursday strike: University Senate and Central
Council closed the school for meaningful dialogue
on Thursday and Friday. Well, how many groups
can close one university and what the hell is going
to happen on Monday after the two days of

dialogue?

Where We’re At

One thing obvious in viewing the events of the
past few days is that there is no viable revolutionary
youth culture at Albany. People are deluding
themselves if they view the events of this past
weekend as part of a pattern of radical activity.
There won‘t be ii revolution here for a long time.
Even a strike is doubtful.

ii is important to know what we are doing. There
are no simplistic answers. We are all confused. The
problem which has been the underlying cause of all
tension the past few years remains-what is the
extent of student involvement in deciding the
functionof a university? Hopefully. this Thursday
and Friday will stimulate communication and

Centriil Council's so-called great
step forward Wednesday night was
perhaps one of the most danger-
ous political moves that body has
ever undertaken. In fact. it was a
step backwards as far as the demo-
cratic process was concerned.

Let's examine the nature of the
bills first. The bills were drawn up
to make sure that Central Council
maintained its position as the
voice of the students, Council
members felt that their power was
going to be circumvented by the
“student power" movement. What
was forgotten was that the stu-
dent power movement mnkcs up
an extremely small portion of the
totiil University. What about the
rest of the students? They were
not even consulted as to their
views. This is inexcusable.

The first bill was concerned
with 50-60 student-faculty mem-
bership on various committees in
each department of the Univer-
sity. This sounds great. but it has
been almost impossible to ﬁnd
students to serve on existing com-
mittees (as was brought up at the
meeting). What makes council
think this will change overnight?

What if there were enough stu-
dents to man the committees?
According to the bill, we are
responsible for interviewing facul—
ty members. Are we'quaiified to
do this? Are we to be paid for this
service? Where do we find the
time to do it?

These questions should have
been explored. They couldn’t be.
however. because of the time fac—
tor, iind the nature of the audi-
encc at the meeting.

The meeting did not lend itself
to a serious consideration of the
bills. Groups made noises to
drown out statements. Mikes were
grabbed from some speakers and
not yielded to others. From one
side of their mouths some were
screaming freedom. and from the
other side they denied freedom to
others. The people who spoke had
nothing really new or exciting to
propose. They said things to ap-
pease the crowd. Their thoughts
were for applause rather than
about the ramifications of the
bills.

Most of the speakers were poll-

of upcoming elections. This was
also true of some of the sponsors
of the bills. Unfortunately we will
never really know whether it was
sincere belief or opportunity that
stimulated the sponsors.

The voting that ensued after
the one-sided deliberation was an
outrage to the electoral process.
Members of Council were scared
to vote “no” because it was a roll
call vote and they felt threatened
by the mood of the crowd.

Statements were made to back
the so and so administrators
against the wall. Council had al-
ready been forced against the
wall. it you keep backing people
against the wall. sooner or later
they'll act in haste. A forced
decision will be regretted by both
sides of any dispute.

Central Council should not
have been intimidated by threat.
Perhaps the room should have
been cleared of observers. There
was no communication without
fear among most council mem-
bars. This seems a little ironic
since one of the bills tried to
protect a man whose very Idea is
communication without fear.
