Sorry 

 

To the Editors: ' ‘ ' ..

I would like to apologize for an
inaccuracy in my feature story
entitled “The Gerry Wagner Con-
trdyersy,’ printed in last Tues-
day‘s ASP.

I stated in the last paragraph of
the article that, because “all sides
have accepted" the renewal deci-
slon, “matters will return to nor-
mal. UnfOrtunately, I was
operating under the erroneous in-
formation thatiboth Gerry Wagner
and the Administration (specifi-
cally, President Kuusisto) had ac-
cepted the one year term renewal
recommended by Dean Perl-
mutter.

This was not the case, and
events of the last few days indi-
cate the controversy may be far
from over.

Sincerely,
William Rohde

That’s Life

Brothers and sisters,

This life as a college student
is unbearable. Outsiders look at
me and read about me and say
“isn't he lucky?" Well, fellow
students maybe you are, but I'm
not. Let me give you some for
instances.

First I don’t have anyone to
smoke L 8: M's with. Now there's
nothing as lonely as not having
someone to smoke L & M‘s with,
especially if you don‘t smoke,
period. Furthermore, I am proba-
bly the unluckiest student in that
I have pot-proof lungs. Like I
can’t get high, man! It all started
when I bought a nickel bag of
alfalfa and failed to get off the
floor. How can I feel that I belong
if I can't get stoned? The closest I
got was when some little kids
pelted me with snowballs as I was
coming out of Central Markets.
Bad scene. But I can grow a beard
and fake it. right? No deal. my
semi-annual shaving partels are the
closest I get to having fun. I grow
1/10 of an inch of stubble in 6
months and then we (my friend

and I) all have a cake with shaving
cream on it. Worse. And like my
last pair of bell bottoms is ready
to rip out at the crotch. And my
beads keep falling all over: my
apartment. Hang on, it gets wowrse.
Let me tell you how rotten life
really is.

I don’t have a car, not even a
little Volkswagen. Do you know
how much valuable time I waste
waiting for the bus? I could be
reading Marx or something, or at
least trying to get stoned. Never
read any of Groucho’s books,
huh? Like my time is valuable,
dig? Life is rotten, but time is
valuable. Then I can discover how
it gets rottener. I think I’ll go
attend some of the student politi-
cal meetings so I can feel brother-
hood and sisterhood and be loved.
Remember Confrontation Mon-
day? All power to the people
May the people get out of their
ruls and be as happy aan loving
as we students are! Up against the
wall, all you evil administrators.
You're not human like we are. We
love our brothers and sisters.
Look, I've got to admit some-
thing. I‘m not as good as the rest
of you students. I can’t even make
a good political speech. Oh,
what's the use? Please excuse my
frown. Tell me how would you
feel if you didn‘t have a car?

I guess I have a shitty attitude.
But I have good reason. I keep
walking into pillar's because the
left lens keeps falling out of my
wire-rim glasses. No perspective,
baby! Now, I've even lost the
razor blade that screws the lens
back into place, Did you ever hear
of such a terrible existence? I just
don't look good in the horn-
rimmed glasses I wore back in my
happy fraternity days. But at least
I was loved then. We really bad
brotherhood before the politicals
did. Ask any of my brothers. Why
don't people talk tome anymore?
don't even have a bullon to
explain what I walk and fighl for,
Somebody once put a "love" but-
ton on my chest and the pin
pricked right through my pride
and joy- the hair on my chest.
After that I doubted my muscu-
linity, and I still do. I‘ve never
even shot a gun or killed a bird.
And l'm 2|.

l‘m hemmed in. Now I'll grad-
uate and I'll have to go into the

Army. I hope they allow mastur-
bation. There's really no choice
for a healthy American boy, is
there? Why don't I just end it all?
And they say that college students
have fun. I'm glad everybody else
are brothers and sisters and love
each other. I guess l‘m not good
enough. I wasn‘t born in this great
country, so I must be an alien.

Does that explain alienation?
Why? Why!
Respectfully,
John P. Juckema
I O
Cntena?

Dear Sirs:

My wrath has been aroused as
has my habitual apathy (conse
quently this letter) as a result of
the dismissal of Professor Cadbury
of the Philosophy Department
whose failure to obtain a doctor-
ate and to publish has led to his
dismissal. Why should a man's
ability be judged on his title or on
the amount of his publications?
Look to his performance as a
teacher which is outstanding. Here
is one man who is more concerned
with teaching and stimulating his
students than with writing or in-
creasing his social stature and eco-
nomic class by affixing a doctor-
ate to his name. How can the
Administration act on such crass,
superficial and material ’values'.’
They argue for recognition as an
"accredited school" with qualified
teachers where qualified seems to
mean possessing a doctorate and
publication. Is it not enough to
leave teachers time to teach crea-
tively and judge their qualifica-
tions by their performance and
impact on their students?

I for one, as a Philosophy
major, feel that the loss of Profes~
sor Cadbury and perhaps the rc«
placement of him by Dr. So and
So will not be the gain of a
“Qualified” teacher but the loss
of a man too concerned with the
intrinsic values of teaching than
with the extrinsic demands of n
screwed up (perhaps that is a bit
euphemistic) Administration - an
Admininstration who places so
creditation before education.

Greek To Me

To the Editors:

The weakness of Greeks on this
campus is obvious. The reason for
this weakness can be attributed in
part to the increased desire of
today's student for a feeling of
individuality, a word which sun
posedly lacks meaning in Greek
organizations. But often this criti-
cism comes from people who have

never experienced Greek life, and
who perhaps aren't fully aware of
what it has to offer. Fraternities
and sororities do insulate their
members from being victims of
the loneliness which faces many
students at large universities, but
it is a mistake to confuse this
insultation with a denialof indivi-
duality.

Furthermore, a large com-
munity such as our university of
twelve thousand people makes it
difficult to realize potential
friendships. An organization such
as a fraternity or sorority can aid
the individual in achieving these
potentials by giving him or her a
smaller community in which to
work,tbu; making it easier to
change acquantances into friends

It is hoped that Greek member-
ship will scrve as a crystallization
of one's ties to the university by
giving him or her a greater attach-
ment to the university through
association with a smaller group
of people. This is not to suggest
that one closes his eyes to the rest
of the university after joining a
fraternity or sorority, for this
indeed would be self-rcstricting.
The individual must always allow
for changes in himself that may be
brought about by the university
community.

Joe Kavanaugh

Consider It!

Dear Editors:

Richard Pcarsall was worried
about apathy, he has no com-
plaint now. TWO hundred children
from the University Community
showed they cured by smashing
twenty windOWs in the Adminis~
tration building. They didn't like
the Administration's decision so
they became belligerent and de-
structiVe. Now Albany State is in
the news.

We can’t take over any Dean's
offices or buildings because any-
thing we’ve ever asked for has
been given fair consideration and
granted. We wanted open dorms
and we got them. We wanted
liquor in the dorms and we got it.
We asked for no hours for fresh-
men women and we got it. But
some people are never satisfied.
Instead of looking at the good
aspects of our school, they search
for more things to complain
about. Sure these are times of
change, but these same demolish-
ers of University property are the
ones wearing the peace signs.

Richard Pearsall was also ex-
cited about the rumored
$300,000 that could be spent on
the landscaping going on between
the Biology building and the Per-
forming Arts Center. Well I hope
he starts worrying about the
$1,000 of unnecessarily broken
windows and needless despoiling
of pillars_on the podium. If the
state allocates money for land-
scaping, so much the better, I'd
rather see a garden than some
more concrete!

But what I don’t want to see
are more broken windows,
marked up pillars, and 1l60 of the
University claiming to represent
the whole community with their
radical actions and quest for per-
sonal power. If the students
would take full advantage of the
representation already available, it
would be obvious that they have
enough to keep them busy. Those
wishing more should have applied
here to be an administrator, not a
student. This is my university too,
and I certainly don‘t wish to see it
overridden by an anarchist mi-
nority!

Help Please

To the f.ditor:

Sometime after 4:30 pm.
on March 12, my office in the
Administration Building was en-
tered. Among the things now mis-
sing is a small, blue, dime-store
ashtray. It is not worth anything,
but it does have sentimental value
to me, and I would be grateful for
its return. Thank you for your
help.

TUESDAY, MARCH 17, 1970

by 1. Stephen Flavin

As we prepare for a hopefully
peaceful two day moratorium of
classes to discuss issues and dif-
ferences dividing the university
community, our sister university
remains in a state of siege

“The streets of our country are
in turmoil, the universities are
filled with students rebelling and
rioting. Communists are seeking
to destroy our country. Russia is
threatening us with her might and
the Republic is in danger. Yes,
danger from within and without,
We need law and order. Yes,
without Law and Order our
nation cannot survive. Elect us
and we will restore law and
order."

This quote has been attributed
to Spiro Agnew and University of
Buffalo President Regan, but
comes from Adolf Hitler. Many
student factions have been united
in a solidarity strike at the State

U n iversity at Buffalo. These
groups’ representatives have
formed a Provisional Revolu-

tionary Government to coordinate
student and faculty activities de-
signed to close all formal classes
on campus until ROTC, Project
Themis (Marine Biology and
Underwater Warfare Research),
Acting President Regan, and all
police are removed from campus.

missions policy for all students -

forty-tire Faculty
Arrested at Bulialo

by Kathi on

At least forty-five faculty mem-
bers of the State University at
Buffalo were arrested Sunday af-
ter staging a peaceful sit-in at
Hayes Hall, the administration
building on the U.B. campus. Po-
lice, notified of the sit—in, relayed
an ultimatum to the faculty:
Leave the premises, or face arrest.
A vote of the faculty unanimously
resolved to remain, and minutes
later, the forty-five were arrested
on charges of criminal trespassing.

Prior to the arrest, the faculty
had released a statement which
read: “Peter Regan and his ad-
ministration have defied the will
of Faculty Senate expressed Wed—
nesday, March ii, for the im-
mediate removal of police from
campus, thereby making them-
selves responsiblc for Thursday's
events. Hence, we the members of
the faculty will occupy Hayes
until the police are removed from
campus and the injunction is lif-
ted.

“We are in sympathy with the
general principles of the strike and
will be fromulating new structures
of University governance to fol-
low chun's resignation for the
consideration of the university
community.

“We call on all faculty members
to join us here."

faculty pleaded innocent to the
charges of criminal trespass and
were released in their own re

Some 500 students marched in

will study ecology, politics, com-
munity relations, socialism, pollu-
tion, etc. and how these fields
relate to the individual worker, his
family and his community.

Regan has vowed the police will
remain to protect taxpayers’ prop-
erty as long as "disruptive condi-
tions persist and until peace is
restored." It is acknowledged that
the 300-400 polico are receiving 1
free meal per 8 hour shift - free
because student funds are pur-
portedly being used. The police
are being housed in Clark Gym,
eols and canteen provided, and no
one will comment on who is
footing the $15,000 daily bill.
Students claim since the admini-
stration invited them, the admin-
stration is responsible - but the
administration may have control
of student funds through the fac-
ulty in the faculty-student associa-
tion (FSA). The Public Relations
Office says it is up to the com-
munity or state to absorb the
costs and no university funds
would be utilized.

Student response to police on
campus was epitomized by a day-
long “Pig Roast." Festivities
began at noon and continued until
eight at night with the arrival of
Jerry Rubin, Tuesday, March 10.

The police intervention not
only united student groups but
aligned some of the faculty
against the administration and
forced entire departments to take
a stand in relation to the strikers
or the administration. The Lin-
guistics Department is allowing
any member to freely choose to
hold classes on campus, or sup-
port the strike and hold classes off
campus, or not hold any classes at

lengthy meetings and belated
soul-searching have arrived at simi-
lar positions.

ual professors accountable for all
class material the department
heads feel relevant to their respec-
tive fields.

Regardless of material to be
covered, sciences are in a bind
because of lab requirements, it is
the students that paid to attend,
paid for instruciton, and those
wishing to honestly attend classes
and not support the strike are, in
some cases, being deprived and
cheated of their “money's
worth." The only alternatives are
to drop the courses, take them
over, or make up the work

possibly over the summer through
an extended school year.

Regan issued a statement claim-
ing the strike a failure and claim-
ing 90% class attendance. Stu-
dents responded by countering
that "on normal days we don’t
even have 90% of the student

body in attendance." Tours of the
campus revealed entire buildings
void of studious bodies. The over-
all opinion is, ”The Strike is
Working!“ Whether Regan knows
this was the only undetermined
question.

Not only have students risen in
numbers to take over the campus,
liberate the administration build-
ing and files, but the Peace Patrol,
initiated by Regan, became dom-
inated by concerned students and
faculty desirous of peaceful pro-
test instead of pitched battles and
violent confrontation. “We hope
to maintain an image of neutrality
and curtail violence by our pres-
ence."

The individual members of the
Peace Patrol were free to join the
pickets or to attend class, but
when doing so they were to re-
move their armbands, symbols of
peace and neutrality. If trouble
arose, they were free to run or
attempt to break it up; it was to
be an individual choice. But the
Peace Patrol went the way of so

Holding Clothing Drive :22: :2:°*..§:.2::..:“:::.: :27..-

by Susan Kellman

This year Kappa Beta fraternity
is holding its third annual clothing
drive for the children of the South
end district. The drive will be held
from Monday, April Iii, through
Tuesday, April 24.

During this week, the fraternity
will count on the university's use
of the depository boxes placed in
the lower lounges of the residence
halls, in the staircases of the Ad-
ministration building, and in the
Campus Center lobby,

In the first year of the drive,
the fraternity collected seventy
pairs ofshoes and thirteen hundred
various articles of clothing; the
last drivc however, was even more
successful, and the drive ended
with one hundred articles of adult

clothing, and four hundred sep-
arate articles of clothing for child-
ren. This year the fraternity es-
pecially wishes to stress the im-
portance of donating childrens
clothing.

The clothing all goes to the
Trinity Institute in the South
End, after it leaves the university.
The Trinity Institute has a thrift
shop and after they sell the
clothing, the money they earn is
turned over to the various assist-
unce programs in the area.

Every year the success of the
drive has increased. With special
concern for the children, in this
particular drive, let us hope that

they will continue on an up-
ward surge.

The faculty unanimously re-
solved that the police should be
removed from campus in a Fae
ulty Senate meeting held in War
Memorial Auditorium last
Wednesday. Four hundred and
seventeen voted to allow Began to
stay and two hundred and sixty-
three voted for his resignation.
This was after Regan publicly
stated “the police were being
phased out."

A week later the police are still
besieging the campus. In protest,
46 members of the faculty staged
a peaceful sit-in in the administ-
ration building and were arrested.
They are now free on $500 bail
each and many intend to sit-in
again, perhaps today.

Very few people on either side
want violence. Many people want
a return to normalcy, but not at
the price of sacrificing relevant
issues, of supporting directly or
indirectly U. S. involvement in
Vital? Nam , or being dictated to by
a "repressive and oppressive ad
ministration” or an unhearing,
unknown Board of University
'I‘rusteeswhose Interests lie in the
companies and banks investing in
war and destruction, the vested
interests instead of investing in
their children and their education.

“A man can not be a slave to
two masters; he will either hate
the‘one and love the other, or
despise the one and respect the
other."
