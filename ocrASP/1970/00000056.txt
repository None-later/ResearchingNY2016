Season; Sauers Pleased

by Jay Marshall

The 1969-70 basketball season
ended more than a week ago when
Albany downed Brooklyn 83-69.
Coach Sauers thus ﬁnished his
ﬁfteenth consecutive season With
a winning record and prospects
for a winner next season seems
good.

Albany began the season slow-
ly, dropping games to Stony

Brook and Plattsburgh after an
overtime victory at Williams. The
team was having trouble scoring
and there was no Rich Margison
to score a clutch basket. The team
was not yet the cohesive offensive
unit it was at the end of the
season. The most important asset
was the team defense which was
ranked among the best in the
nation. As the season progressed

Potter Wins Second
Straight Mat Crown

AMIA held its annual wrestling
tournament this weekend with
Potter Club emerging as the
victor for the second consecutive
year.. STB was second with 55
total points, eleven short of EEP,
with APA third. garnering 49.

The following men should be
given much credit, not just for
their wrestling ability which is
obvious but more for their res-
pective battles with the scale in
order to, in most cases, get down
to their weight classes.

won the Capital City Tournament

of the last campaign was the

With four starters returning, AI-
bany has the nucleus of a fine
squad next season. Jack Jordan,
will be back for his third varsity
season and will be joined by Jim
Masterson, Al Reid, and Steve
Sheehan all of whom will be
seniors. Couch Sauers has said that.
as many as five members from the
freshmen team will move up to
the varsity. Top prospects seem to
be 6-4 Werner Kolln, 6-2 Dave
Welehons, and 6-2 Bob Curtiss.
Transfer students Bob Rossi and
John Quattrochi will be eligible
next season and seem to be the
leading candidates to fill the guard
position being vacated by the
graduation of this year’s captain
Jack Adams. Both practiced with
the varsity this winter and were
members of Potter Club's League
I Championship team. Two re—
serves from this year's team, Mike
Hill and Hohn Heher, will also be
counted on next season.

This abundance of talent may
require Sauers to cut members in
a tryout session for the first time.
It is impossible to make an ac—
curate prediction with the season
still months away, but barring an
unforseeabie catastrophe, Albany
fans can look forward to a fine
team next year.

Freshman Basketball
- An Apology

by Dave Fink

 

 

 

At this time (admittedly late), recognition should indeed be given
to this year's freshman basketball team. Coach Sauers has stated that
it was the best in his fifteen years at State - few can disagree.

it would be impossible to single out any one player in evaluating
the squad - in fact, it would be wrong to do so. This could be easily
seen by the fact that on the average, nine or ten men would play in
every ball game with one man seldom dominating the scoring.

Starters over the course of the campaign, Werner Kolln, Bob
Curtiss, Bob Obermayer, Dave Weichons, Steve Howard and Chris
Burke, indeed, deserve much of the credit, but at the same time, little
if any of the squad's effectiveness was lost when the likes of Tom
Lawrence, Tim Minnehan and Bob Moore entered the game.

Looking for the good shot, hitting the open man, quickness and
fine defense characterized their play and while it was the players Wl‘lL.
affected all these aspects, much praise is due Coach Bob Lewis who
molded these athletes into the team they were.

Dr. Sauers expects no fewer than five players to graduate to the
varsity next year. This alone is proof enough of the fine team We had
this year, but which got so little coverage throuin no fault but my

Athletic Scholarships

Edward E. Potter Club, a cam-
pus fraternity at State University
at Albany, has established a
scholarship fund providing $400 a

ear for each of two scholar-
athietes for at least two years. The
freternity has stipulated the award
go to basketball players, unless
that sport has no qualiﬁed pros
peers in a given year. The scholar-
ship will be administered by the
University’s financial aids office.

Recipients must meet all uni-
versity academic requirements.
State University of New York
doesn't permit state money to be
used for athletic scholarships, but
student or alumni groups may
allocate funds for such purposes.

Varsity basketball coach Dick
Sauers was understandably
pleased with the scholarship.
“This definitely is a step in the
right direction," he said. “l’d like
to see other fraternities establish
similar awards. With such help, we
could begin to attract some of the
top players we now are losing for
lack of financial assistance. In
basketball, a few such players a
year could make a world of dif-

ference."

Athletic director Dr. Alfred
Werner welcomed the scholarship
as “an opportunity to improve the
development of our intercollegiate
sports program at Albany."

Although athletes are eligible
for financial aid based on need,
this is only the second scholarship
at the university specifically estab-
lished for athletes. The James A.
Warden Memorial Scholarship is
given annually, but not necessarily
to a varsity performer? it could be
awarded to an intramural athlete.
This year's Warden Scholarship
was shared by senior basketball
and baseball star Jim Sandy and
junior soccer and golf standout
Joel Voiinski.

To the Editors:
There is an issue in the air
which has not really as such been
brought into the forefront as
yet...1t is the tenure issue—Pro-
fessors Wagner, Tucker, and Cad-
bury will not be returning to the
University in the fail because of
failure to gain tenure—tenure,
however, is based on degrees and
amount of published material ra-
ther than on the most important
criterion of all, teaching ability—
This is wrong. Once granted ten-
ure, a teacher has a job for life
whether he can teach or not,
whether he develops with the
times or not—This is also wrong.
WSUA feels that the current
tenure system should be abolished
in favor of a system of 3-year
renewable contracts. In this way,
the service of all professors would
be evaluated periodically. Albany
State should not become a haven
for teachers who can‘t teach—We
urge all students and faculty mem-
bers to push for this reform.
Sincerely,
Keith Mann
Station Manager

Points

To the Editors:

During the past few Weeks, the
procedure of hiring and firing has
been shown for its stupidity. The
priorities seem to be vague and
somewhat meaningless. I feel a
well defined point system should
be initiated. 1 have drawn up a
model which could be revised. 1
present it to you for your ideas of
refinement.

The plan is based on a scale of
Ill points and has four standards
of evaluation. The first area is
research. The research will be
evaluated by a panel of 60% facul~
ty and 50% junior and senior
majors in that department. This
will be worth 2 points.

The second criterion is publish-
ing. Again, this will be evaluated
by a panel of 50% faculty from
tho department and 50% student
majors in the department. This
would also be worth 2 points.

'I‘hc third standard is contribu-
tion to the community. Admitted-
ly this is the vnguest point. An

instructor can, however, make ‘

contributions. His research and-or
publishing could tie into this. His
availability outside of the class-
room .could also be a part of his
contribution. This would be de-
cidedIby the same panels as des-
ciiEed‘ above.

The final criterion is teaching.
This would be broken down into
two areas: ability to communi-
cute, and motivation. An evalua-
tion of the instructor by the
students who have him will be the
deciding factor. The evaluation
will be taken near the end of
every semester. The results will be
evaluated and made public. Four
points will be given to the opin-
ions of majors and minors; 2
points for each area. Two points
will be given to the opinions of
the other students who are taking
the professor; one point will go to
each area.

Together these add up to 13
points:

2 research

2 publishing

3 community contributions

6 teaching majors and minors

others

There will be only one time
when a Ph.D. will be required, and
that is in the instruction of grad-
uate students.

To the Editors:

At 2:30 am. two upper eche-
lon administrators popped their
heads out their office doors to
discuss the "issues" with us twelve
outside agitators. They were al-
lowing us to occupy the building
all night or at least until we fell
asleep. One of these prominent
administrators was dominant, and
he was the person who talked at
us for a couple of hours. He was
polite, evasive, and perhaps the
most pcrvertcdly impersonal man
I've ever spoken towards. it is his
total lack of speaking about any-
thing that relates to anyone per-
sonally that prohibits me from
giving him credit, by name, for
these out of context quotes. We
feel they do him justice:
