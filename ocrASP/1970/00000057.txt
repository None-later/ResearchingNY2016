before support from the Univer-
sity community could be counted
upon. Smith said that the only
reason that he attempted to chair
the meeting was to help “lead the
group out of their morass."

The demands themselves were
referred to as merely a “working
list," and that it was the “intent”
of each demand that had to be
considered and reckoned with.

Obviously aware of and fearing
the possible negative reaction to
the group, the steering committee
groped for a title. Strike com-
mittee was a suggestion; Central
Coordinating Committee was
another. Using the two titles in
conjunction was also suggested.

The group broke into com-
mittees. A “Rumor Committee"

as formed in an attempt to
facilitate communications
between the University com-
munity and the group. Others
'grouped in an effort to dis-
seminate the list of 21 demands to
the students, and another formed
a phone committee which was
responsible for contacting the
faculty to inform them about the
Sunday night meeting that the
committee had decided to hold.

Sunday

Sunday night approximately
150 faculty members attended the
semi- closed meeting with the now
newly titled Ad Hoe Committee.
Paul Mann chaired the meeting
and opened by explaining the
procedure that would be used to
inform the faculty. He introduced
the ad hoe committee of 12
students, explained how the com‘
mittee had “arisen spon-
taneously" in an effort to deal
with the problems at hand; he also
ﬁlled the faculty in on the events
of the weekend.

He read the list of 21 demands
and prefaced each with a brief
rationale.

After the initial information
was given, the students of the
committee were to move out
among the faculty to facilitate
dialogue. Dissension on this action
was voiced by two faculty mem-
bers, but the small groups were
formed.

it was difficult to tell, but it
seemed that most of the faculty
present were in sympathy with a

student strike. Most of the faculty
seemed to find points among the
21 demands that they disagreed
with. A suggestion was made that
the faculty join the student
meeting that was already in pro;
mess. and this suggestion was
agreed upon. ‘
Mass Meeting

Over 500 students were at the
meeting in LG. 7. Factionalism
was evident among those students
and faculty who spoke from the
podium and the audience. The
authority of the Ad Hoc Com-
mittee was challenged. Paul Mann
was attacked at intervals for at-
tempting to chair the meeting.
One student asked that “every-
thing be started over since so
many factions were present." This
request met with a tired, negative
response. Another student said
“it's true we need action, but let's
decide what we're taking action
on.”
Dr. Johnpoll from the Political
Science Department spoke. He
felt that "students and faculty
should run the school, and no-
body else. The administration
should do its job, which is to
clean out the men’s and ladies'
rooms." He said that “the school
should be run for education, not
for the greater glory of the ad-
ministration. When the budget is
cut, it is the professors that leave,
not the administrators - adminis-
trators are falling over one anoth-
er," His speech met with a re-
sounding positive response.

Another faculty member, Dri
Eckstein, was against the 5050
proposal. In stating his reasons
why he said, “There is a lot more
work involved in these commit-
tees than the students realize, and
there are some areas that students
are not qualified to participate
in." He gave as an example for the
latter reason, “students can judge
faculty members already present
in the University, but they are not
qualified to judge new instructors
applying for positions."
Several students and faculty mcmA
hers reminded the audience that
many of the committees that the
students wanted were already in
cxistencc.They stated that the
problem was not one of making
provisions for student parti-
cipation, but one of finding stu-
dents willing to participate.

Faculty Opinion

Jeff Smith wanted action. lie
called for a week's stoppage of
classes. During this week the stir-
dents would bc informed about
the reasons why tliev shouldn‘t go
to classes. lie said that a strike
was more than a boycott - it
required more tahn a refusal by
some students to go to classes. it
required pickets and other means
to make all students realize why
they shouldn't be in classes.

At this point, it studcnt said,
“coercion should not be used to
prevent those students who want
to go to cla..cs from going." Dr.
Finder. from the Education De}
partment said, “there is no such
thing as a University run by strike,
threat rind violence."

tration doesn’t feel anything is
wrong. Most students don't realize
that they're being screwed day
after day after day. Students are
needed on all committees. The
students must be spoken to first.
Let them feel it in their gut that
something is wrong." Another fac-
ulty member retorted, “close it
(the University) and then think."

Fred Cohen, Gerry Wagner’s
legal advisor and an associate pro-
fessor in the School of Criminal
Justice spoke to the group. He
appealed to the students fo focus
on one issue, and impressed upon
them the idea that the adminis-
tration had been lying contin-
uously.

Dr. Eson from the Psychology
Department spoke to the students
and said, “if you want to change
the University, close it by with-
drawing from it." A student yel-
led, “You're a phoney liberal."
Eson retorted, "I‘m not a liberal
at all."

Lieberman from the Sociology
Department. who had helped to
rephrase the 21 demands, said,
“You already have your commit-
tees, in the Sociology Department
nobody wanted to work." He also
raiscd the question of “Who will
be on what committee? How will
they get there?"

Demand Debate

Throughout the discussions and
after the bulk of them, several
motions WerLI madc rind voted on.
What seemed to be the issue at
stake was whether to use the 21
demands or the demands from
Central Council or both. Dave
Neufcld wanted to return to the
Council demands, He gave the
demands as a 50-50 ratio of facul-
ty to students on the Student
Conduct Committee, and on Fac»
ulty Senate and its councils, and
on the departmental committees
coiiccrncd wilh the hiring, firing
and tenure of facully mcmbcrs. it
was also slipulalcd that on the
latter (,‘omliiiltcc thcrcbc no vcto
power over the departmental do
cisions.

Opinions vncillated between
what demands should be used.

the 21 demands, seemed opposed
to them and stated “it is a ques-
tion of what you do once you

intimate that the major problem
was to get the power, get on the
committees, and then all the other
demands would simply fall into
line after the power was had.

The final decision of the slowly
dwindling group was to decide
that the future demands and
priorities should be decided upon

Arrest of Freshman Student
Questioned by Central Council

Central Council and about 300
students cross-examined President
Kuusisto and Vice-Presidents
Olson and Thorne last night over
the arrest of Frank Borzilleri, xi
freshman from Van Cortlandt Hall
who was charged with ‘criminal
trespass‘ for his actions last Friday
night. The students and their stu-
dent goverflment continually
questioned these three men for
more than two hours.

Dick Wesley opened up the
dialogue by inquiring about the
status of present arrests and asked
about any future arrests. Thorne
replied, ‘There has been one ur-
resl. the investigation is con-
tinuing and no other arrests have
been made.‘ Dr. Thorne also ad
mitted that it was Mr. Henighan
who had made the arrest.

Dave Ncufcld risked why
lienighrin didn't refer the case to
strident. judicial as he had done in
the past with cases of theft, drugs,
criminal trespass, and forgery. The
reply was that they were nol cases
that clearly warranted [he use of
external court system.

A case was mentioned in which
$40,000 worth of tax cards were
stolen from the University, and
yet the accused offender was tried
internally. The (‘iisl‘ pointed out
inconsistencies of the administra-
lion's values, a major theme of the
mccling.

Another major point brought
up by Dick Wcsicy was liial llic
arrr-stcd student Sl‘l'lliS to be a
'sacrificial Inmh' so that llic Al-
bany community mighl lic paci~
licrl 'i'hus Wesley was accusing
the administration of letting itself
be pressured by people who were
nol members of the University
coinmunily into doing wlial was
nol probably in the best inlcrcsl.
of this institution. Olson answer-
ed, ‘Wo can't let things go
by. Lenny Kopp asked if the
administration sanctioned the
arrst and if it will prosecute. Even
though Inspector Henighan was
the complaint signer it was SUNY
at Albany who was the pro-

Another problem confronting
administration and students was
one of bad faith and mistrust
between both. The Administra-
tion, represented by Kuusisto,
Olson, and Thorne, said that if
students would pay for the
twenty-five windows broken on
Friday night, the Administration
would consider dropping charges.
The students however were not
assured of this. Some thought it
was a breech of faith, because
the Administration called for stir-
dean to pay, yet it would not be
obliged to take a stance in favor
of Borzilieri.

To further the student's sus»
picion of the Administration‘s
poor faith the students cited a few
contradictory statements on the
part of the Administration. Also
the Administration ‘backcd the
arrcst' said Olson, and he will
subsequently "take full responsi-
bility."

Lenny Kopp asked whether any
more undercover agents were on
the case, to which Olson said
“Nol at this poinl." And, in op-
position to an curlicr stalcment by
Olson, who said he was not under
pressunI to arrest, hc admitted
that he was influenced by "cori-
.scrvativc fricnds" who called for
rm rill-oul alternpl to iirrcsl all of
thc offenders.

The final statcmcnl llial gavc
(‘\’i(il'll(‘l' of poor failh on iill’ purl
of the Arhninislralion was made
by Ncul'clrl, who nsitcti “who thr-
ill'ii Henighan is lo make valuc
judgments"(as in which cases re-
main within the jurisdiction of the
University).

Probably the mosl complicated
and controversial topic discils’icd
was ethical values, The Admini‘
slration and the Albany Com-
munity seem to hold dearly the
rule of law, therefore the breaking
of windows and unlawful trespass
are morally and legally wrong
because they might lead to dis
order, They belich the law must
be upheld because the legal code
is sacred, because if broken, can
only invite instability and possibly
anarchy.

Many students, however
seemed to hold the freedom of
Frank Borzilleri above that of the
$1000 property damage. As
Lenny Kopp said, “Is entering a
building such a great crime?"
Wasn't there a reason for his
action, and that the offense
should not be taken at face value?

The first arrest arising out of

occurred Wednesday morning. At

Inspector John Henighan of
Security informed the ASP that
'thc investigation is continuing.‘
But just how the investigation
would continue remained the ma-
jor question last night following
an open meeting of Central Coun-
cil. An offer of $1000 was made
to Dr. Thorne yesterday around
noon. He accepted the pledge ‘in
good faith' and stated:

hundreds of students, faculty, a
few brave administrators and
‘outsidc agitators" met in work-

past few weeks and alternatives
available in light of those events.

The topics of discussion includ-
ed “Legal Proccdurc~Amnesty for

“Save Your Environment."
“Gerry Wagner Controversy,"
“Student as Nigger," “Racism on

room was scheduled for the dia-
logue on anarchy and people were
discouraged from attending.

ation) “officiated” at their res-
pective workshop. They explained
that a bill was pending before the
University Senate to eliminate
“general requirements" and one
year of Physical Education.Dc-
partmental requirements would
not be affected. “If this bill is
passed, a department can still re-
quire a foreign language, but it
must be included in the number
of credits toward a major. Once
this bill is approved by the Univer-
sity Senate, the decision is final
and does not have to be approved

who is doing the investigative

CURE is sponsoring opinion

of abolishing requirements would
be to lift artificial restrictions."
After general requirements were
abolished at some schools, their
ratings declined. it was noted that
this has not yet happened at the
University of Buffalo.

The “Dialogue for Amnesty"
needed officiation. Most of the
students, 300 in steady attend-
ance, 200 drop-ins, drop-outs ob-
served a polarized shouting match
replete with outside agitators-

Tire majority-though most remain-

the means to produce desired

ion and strength. We will follow

"Does the administration run
