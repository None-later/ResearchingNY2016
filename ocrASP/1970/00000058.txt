Demonstrators Arrested at
Induction Center Sit—In

by Neill Shanahan

Twenty-nine people, young and
elderly, slit in front of the Albany
Induction Center yesterday to
stop the everyday business of
sending men to Viet Nam. After
sitting for four and a half hours
on the cold, windy street, ﬁfteen
were arrested.

Some taken into custody for
“disorderly conduct" were A1-
bany State students.

The arrests, many forcible in
the face of passive resistance, were
made during the busy downtown
lunch hour and consequently were
witnessed by many hundreds of
office workers.

The War Resistors League, "a
group which opposes all war and
violence and seeks to remove the
causes of war" organized the sit-in
in concert with Anti-Draft Week
protests throughout the nation.

Under the direction of In-
spEClur Mahar of the Albany po-
lice, some of the protestors were
carried bodily to pudtlvaagons.
While some Went peaceably under
their own power, it was the con-
viction of the others not to co-
operate in any way with the po-
licc.

lnspcctor Mllhar said that a
corridor had to he maintained for
free entrance to the building. Of
those curried bodily, one woman
was included.

One of those arrested was Mrs.
'l‘heodurc Adams, whose husband
is 11 professor Ill the English Dc«
partment llcrc.

Anuthl'r prolcstor was a hit
your old Quaker, Mr. John Dunicr.
“Non-violence is the only thing
which makes sumac," he said. “It is
thc only realistic way of up
proaching l‘l‘lllllUHh‘ among people
and among nations in this nuclear

Another taken into custody
was Simon Burrows, just returned
from Viet Nam and now a student
at Union College. He said he had
gone to Viet Nam with an “open
mind", thinking the US. presence
there might have some purpose,
but found instead that we are
engaged in “simply a nationalistic
war."

At first the demonstrators sat
in on the steps to the Federal
Building. In order to remove
them, Federal marshalls dcputized
ﬁfteen maintenance employees of
the center. At approximately
10:30 AM. the demonstrators
were dragged one by one to the
street below where they con-
tinued to sit. The arrests came at
12:30 P.M. and even afterwards
these deputies were seen pushing
and shoving the protesters, par-
ticularly the women.

“I have a son in Viet Nam,‘
one deputy said. “These here are
the enemy—“anything which
helps the Vietcong which does not
cooperate in any way with thc
army and navy."

While a few onlookers were
vocal in open disapproval, many
were sympathetic. “I wish I had
the courage to do what they are
doing" one said.

Another passer-by was Mrs. Jo-
sephine Ross, 62 years old. She
strongly approved. "We can't run
our own country so how can we
expect to run the world." she
said.

Across the street about 50 stu-
dents chanted, sang and held ban~
ncrs throughout the morning. A
law also passed out lcul‘lels to the
slowly passing curs.

Many of those who came to theI
Center to be inducted either
pushed their way through or hur-
died the group. A police captain
lryillg to gain entry could not

 

jump so stepped across shoulders
and arms of the protestors.

Nevertheless, abut six or seven
refused to enter when they saw
the demonstrators. One was a
black ex-Marine, Howard
Johnson, 19 years old, who was to
report his discharge to the rev
cruiter. “Personally, I'm for the
war, but I don't think it would be
right to break up their demonstra-
tion. I'm for what they're doing.
too."

Of those who did enter, Father
PaulSmith, chaplain here at Al-
bany State said,“l feel they have
to be respected. I’m sorry they
have made this particular choice,
however, when so many of the
practical implications of the war
lie in the hands of the inductees."
Father Smith was present “in a
supportive way."

The mood was conviction, nol
force. Said one onlookcri I"l'his is
a serious indictment of America."

NOTICE

On Monday, March 2, a sub-
ject non-student was arrested in
the University library on a
charge of public lewdness fol-
lowing complaint made by a
female student.

Students are strongly urged
to report such incidents to the
Security Ofﬁce to furtllcr ex-
pedite investigation.

Pluralism - Theme

of 1967 Study

A study of the needs of under-
graduate education in a “world of
accelerating change" was the task
undertaken by a special commit-
tee of the Undergraduate Academ-
ic Council appointed in January
1967. The result was an innovat-
ive report dealing with the entire
process of education, emphasising
the importance of educational
pluralism. This report was approv-
ed by University Senate two years
ago.

The report was intended to be a
broad, general guideline for the
future development of undergrad-
uate education at the State Uni-
versity of New York at Albany.
The report stated that the univer-
sity should “provide at least two
or more paths for every major
educational goal"

The Albany Student Press is
reprinting excerpts from this
report in this issue in the hope
that it will be of'use to students
during our two days of “Dia-
loguc.“ Since this report has al-
ready been acceptcd by the Uni-
versity, plans for its speciﬁc im-
plementation could be a fruitful
discussion topic.

The organization of curriculum
is one of the primary concerns of
the special report. One proposal is
the institution of a three years
Masters program. This means a

student could unify his upper two
years of college with an additional
study in a single program.

Among the more unusual pro-
posals of the committee was the
“institution of an ‘Experimental
College‘ ” which would integrate
the last years of high school
with the first two years of college.
In this plan, students would be
admitted in the tenth grade.

The recurring theme of the
report is an emphasis on “inde-
pendent study." The report states
that “In the last analysis only
independent study is effective
study...we strongly recommend
that all necessary steps be taken
to make independent study a
dominant factor on the Albany
Campus."

Another proposal deals with a
new type of program—-.l.e Gen-
eral College. This would specialize
in general, liberal arts education.

Also endorsed is the concept of
the "departmental program." This
would allow a student to enter
directly into the department of
his major and follow the suggest-
ions and recommendations of his
department in planning his pro-
gram. So for three departments

-English, Classics, and German
rv—have had departmental major
programs. Romance Language and
Comparative Literature now have
programs awaiting final approval.
