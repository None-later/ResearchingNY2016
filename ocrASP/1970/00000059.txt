JORDAN ANDREID ELECTED C0-CAPTAINS

Juniors Jack Jordan of Green
Island and Alan Reid of Bingham-
ton were elected co-captains of
the 1970-71 State University at
Albany varsity basketball team at
a recent post-season banquet. Jor-
dan also was named this year's
Most Valuable Player and Reid
received a trophy» as the free
throw accuracy champion.

Outgoing captain Jach Adams
of Voorheesville was presented
with coach Dick Sauers"‘100%
Award.” The award is given to the
player who earns the most points
during the season based on a
system devised by Sauers to honor
“my type of ballplayer.” Taken
into consideration are such things
as defense, play execution. loose

ball reconveries, and other
aspects of what often is called the
floor game. Adams averaged 11.9
points a game in this, his third
varsity season.

Jim Masterson, a junior from
Albany, was chosen Most Im-
proved Player and will receive an
award at the university’s All
Sports Banquet in May. He aver-
aged 11.8 points a game and
excelled on defense. Jim is a
transfer from Ithaca College.

Jordan led the 13-9 Great
Danes in scoring (16.5) and re-
bounding(255). He was the high
scorer in 12 games and the leading
rebounder in 18 despite standing
just six-feet. The LaSalle of Troy
graduate scored 364 points, 17th

eight men at the university ave
scored over 800 points in a three-
year- career, a mark Jordan should
reach next winter.

Reid, a Brooms Tech transfer,
made 74.3% of his free throws
(52-70), while averaging 10.0
points a game and grabbing 159
rebounds. The 6-2 blond eager
also led the Danes with 56 assists.

Freshman Post season honors
went to Werner Kolln of Kingston
who was named Most Valuable
Player on the 1969-70 State Uni-
versity at Albany freshman bas-
ketball team. The 64 forward led
the team in scoring (12.6) and
rebounding (153), as the Dane
pups recorded a 13-5 mark, se-
cond best in Albany frosh basket-
ball history.

Kolln is a 1969 graduate of

Kingston High, where he lettered
in basketball, golf, and
country.

First Varsity Lacrosse Season Scheduled
After ‘Unbelievable’ 14-1-1 Club Record

This Spring will mark the first
time that lacrosse will be played
on a varsity level at Albany State.
After compiling an unbelievable
two year club record of 14-1-1,
coaches John Ocorgnn and Bill
Muse feel that this year's team
will be stronger than ever.

Returning from last year's
team, which was ranked as the
nation's number one college la-
crosse club, are uttachmen Steve
Jakwuy, Larry Smith, Mike Bar-
lotta, Andy Egol, and Bruce Sand.

Back from the first two mide
ﬁelds are Kevin Sheehan, Mark
Werder Tom Mullin, Marshall
Winkler, Mike Jolub and Bernard
McGuerty III.

On defense, George Turo, Tom
Osterman, Curt Smith and Barry
Kelstein are all battling for the
three defense positions.

Goal tending should be strong
with both Bob Cole and Tom
Gicouinto back in the nets.

The lacrosse team will remain
at Albany over most of Easter

recess. Scrimmages have been
scheduled with the Mohawk La-
crosse Club and RPI and :1 [onto
tive scrimmage with U.Mass, the
fifth ranked team in the nation
last year.

Lacrosse has been billed as the
fastest sport on two feet» as well
as the most exciting. Witlr the
season beginning shortly after
Easter and with the high caliber
of the Albany State stickmcn, all

sports fans will have a good
chance to see why in just a few
weeks.

Garvcr, Hatkoff Pace Bowlers

Last Saturday eleven State
bowlers traveled to Utica to com-
pete in a college tourna-
ment at Pin-o-rama Bowl. There
were 25 teams, representing about
14 different colleges throughout
the state; Albany sent two 5-man
squads. The eleven keglcrs in-
cluded ten of the highest
average bowlers from League I
and a 177 averagec bowler from
League II, Joe Kannnr.

The first three games bowled m

games for the doubles trophies,
State finished both first and
second. The duo of Bruce Hatkoff
and Glenn Garver were number
one finirners in this event for the
day with scores of 596 and 564
respectively. Placing second over
the field of over 60 squads, just ii
pins less in total than the first
place team, was the combo of
Larry MucDowell and Nick Meis-
ter. All four bowlers received
trophies for their efforts. One
additional trophy was awarded to
Nick Meister for having the fourth
highest singles series in the second
set of games. His smashing total of

CURE Schedules
Open Hearings,Poll

Last spring, a proposal to eli-
minate the general undergraduate
degree requirements at SUNYA
was presented to Faculty Senate,
after having been reviewed and
approved by the Curriculum Com-
mittee and Undergraduate Aca-
demic Council of the Senate. The
proposal was tabled, primarily be-
cause it lacked a plan of imple-
mentation and needed proof of
significant support throughout the
University community. As mem-
bers of CURE, the Committee for
Undergraduate Requirement Eli-
mination, we have undertaken to
supply the implementation plan
which was called for, and we are
circulating this plan, along with
the original proposal, to guage the
degree of support which exists for
our program.

To further educate the Univer-
sity community about our plan,
CURE has scheduled a series of
open hearings throughout the Uni-
versity for the week of April 6-10.
CURE will also conduct an open
opinion poll on April 15, 16, 17
in the Campus Center Main
Lounge to discern student support
for the proposal.

At the April 20, 1970 meeting
of the University Senate the issue
of undergraduate requirement eli-
mination will be brought before
the members of the Senate. At.
that time, we will be able to
present University Senate with
evidence of support for the plan
of climintaing general degree re-
quirements.

The text of the proposal and
implementation amendment fol-
lows.

Abortion

by Donna Santora

After an emotional 5-hour de~
bate, the State Senate Voted Wed-
nesday to repeal practically all
restrictions on abortion. The new
reform measure, passed by a vote
of 31-26 and sent to the As-
sembly, would make abortion sim-
ply a matter between a woman
and her doctor.

The bill doesn't enumerate the
grounds for legal abortion. Instead
it abolishes all criminal penalties
for licensed physicians who per-
form abortions. Still illegal will be
abortions performed by persons
who aren‘t doctors.

The measure, unlike a similar
law recently passed in Hawaii con-
tained no residency requirements,
no time limit on when an abor-
tion can be performed during
pregnancy or how many times a
woman could obtain an abortion.

The bill was also written in
such a way that if a pill were to be
developed that could induce abor-
tion, its use would be legal if
prescribed by a licensed physician.

Becdusc the Senate is usually
considered the more conservative
house in the legislature, its action
enhanced the prospects for the
bill's passage in the Assembly.

Penalties

Governor Rockefeller has re-
peatedly called for a reform of the
current 87 year old law which
now permits abortions only when
necessary to save the life of the
woman. Thus his approval is con-
sidered likely should the measure
reach his desk.

The reform measure was draft-
ed by Senate Majority leader Earl
Brydges and his staff as a com-
promise between other proposals
sponsored by Assemblywoman
Constance Cook of Ithaca and
Assemblyman Albert Blumenthal.
Mrs. Cook's bill repealed all pen-
alties for abortions and allowed
abortion on demand. Blumen—
thul's bill added several new con-
ditions permitting abortions.

Most of the legislative leaders,
both Republicans and Democrats,
have made it clear that they did
not consider the abortion issue as
a partisan measure. They also felt
that the vote crossed religious
affiliation as well. They termed
the measure as a personal con-
siderntion for each individual
legislator to decide as he saw fit
and that the moral dicision in-
volved should be left up to the
pregnant mother.
