To the Editors and the Student
Body:

As a reporter for the ASP I
have tried to remain as objective
as possible when covering the
events of the past week and one-
half. I guess that I managed to
keep this "objectivity" because I
didn‘t feel that I was being direct-
ly affected by what the other
students were complaining about.
I understood the concepts behind
the Gerry Wagner controversy.
Since I did not know Wagner as a
teacher. I did not feel the same
emotions as did his students over
the issue of his reinstatement.
Now, however these very same
emotions have “been brought
home" to me.

My English instructor, Peter
Cousins. will not have his contract
renewed next year. When I saw
the posters containing this infor-
mation, and when it was verified
by Mr. Cousins I guess I felt the
same disbelief and anger as did
those students who had been sup-
porting Gerry Wagner.

How can an instructor whose
class is closed by the beginning of
the second week of registration.
who must turn away students who
are trying to be signed in. whose
class is always filled to the extent
that students must sit on the
windowsills who is an excellent.
knowledgeable instructor, be dis-
missed?

All right, now everyone answer
my question in urison, “It is
because he doesn't have his PhD."
Well who gives a damn? This is
my second semester with Peter
Cousins, and hopefully I will have
another semester with him. In my
short stay here at SUNY Albany
he has been my best instructor.
Almost everyone who has had Mr.
Cousins will tell you that he is an
excellent teacher. Just ask them.
Someone please ask them!

I do not favor the 60-60 pro-
posal but I feel that it is a must
that students be involved in de-
ciding which teachers stay and
which do not. When an instructor
ls brought up for tenure or term
renewal all his students should be
polled. Perhaps a questionnaire
precedure along the lines of SECT
should be implemented. Perhaps
also the method of speaking with
an instructor‘s students. as Dean
Perlmutter employed when
evaluating Gerry Wagner. should
be used.

Peter Cousins has completed all
the courses necessary towards his
PhD. He has not however taken
his Comprehensive Exams nor has
he written his thesis. Since it is
stipulated in his contract that he
Would get his PhD.. Mr. Cousins
feels that there isn’t much of a
chance to reverse the non-renewal
decision. Peter Cousins wants to
stay at SUNY Albany. If by
changing the wording of his con—
tract he will be allowed to stay,
then let's change that wording. If
changing the balance of decision
making power within the depart-
ment will facilitate his remaining
here, then let's change the balance
of power. I

Peter Cousins must remain
here. He is much loo valuable to
lose.

Sincerely.
Vicki Zeldin

Responsibility
To the Editors:

The Tuesday, March 17 edition
of the ASP carried a front page
picture of a fellow graduate stu-
dent with a caption implying a
relationship between him and the
police. or at least that the police
supply him with official footwear.
The misuse of his picture is an

cations

 

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

 

insidious attempt to malign the
character of a fellow student and
to make indictment, albeit im-
plied, against an individual with-
out cause or justification.

The classification of individuals
on the basis of dress. I thought.
was a tactic reserved for those
opposing the ideals of individual
freedom and free expression. It is
apparent that the irresponsibility
of such an act is not solely re-
served for the forces of repression.

I believe that the ASP has
perpetrated an injustice and
should be made aware of the need
for responsibility on its part.

The cause of student rights will
not be furthered through the
singling out of individuals for pub-
lic ridicule on the front pages of
your paper. You have acted with-
out thought to his individual
rights nor concern for his indi-
vidual welfare and safety.

The Chicago Seven stood trial
to defend their right to take con-
trol over their own lives. Are you
going to deny the right of a fellow
student to wear shoes of his own
choosing? Are you going to deny
his right of free passage through-
out the school community?

In a sense you already have and
you should do all in your power
to rectify this injustice.

Freedom and Responsibilin .

Sir:

It would be good if you
could more accurately identify
the contributors to the “Com-
munications” section of the ASP.

I should not like to take the
credit (or blame) for the views
expressed by the Charles Sullivan
(72 perhaps?) whose feelings on
student power appeared on March
17.

Error
To the Editor:

Last Thursday an ASP photo-
grapher saw me, wearing black
boots among the students pro-
testing in front of the Administra-
tion Building. The photographer
jumped to the conclusion that
police wear boots. therefore, I was
a policeman. There was no legiti-
mate evidence to support the
photographer‘s notion that I was a
policeman, yet this picture was
published on the front page with
the caption, "...a casually interest-
eu bystander and his official Po-
lice Department footwear." This
accusation is slanderous.

The footwear in the picture is
not that of "official police." but
Army combat boots (all that re-
mains of my time in the Pennsylr
vania National Guard). 1 am a full
time doctoral student and have
never been involved in any kind of
policework.

To me it is unbelievable, at this
time of heightened student ten»
sion. that anyone would publish
my picture as a policeman survey-
ing a student demonstration. It is
upsetting that students have con»
fronted me and demanded that I
prove that I am not a cop.

You have used your right of
free speech to make slanderous
statements based on my shoes.

(name witheld)

Not on campus
To the editors:

This is in response to Jack
Schwartz's letter that appeared on
Tuesday. Schwartz claims he relies
on the opinions of students living
in residence to form his judgment
that RA’s and directors are pigs. I
wonder which students Mr.
Schwartz asked. I seriously doubt
if he consulted anyone who was
not paranoid about the use of
drugs in the dorms; i also doubt if
he consulted any reasonable. non-
radical students.

I wonder where . Schwartz‘s
“personal experience" with RA's
comes from. It doesn't come from
living in a dorm at Albany State.
(A simple check of the phone
books for the last two years re-
veals that.)

Schwartz accuses me of has-
tardizing the term “one dimen-
sional." A little thought about the
phrase reveals that it can be used
in more ways than Marcuse sug-
gests One of the more useful ones
is to describe a condition similar
to Mr. Schwartz's. Anyone who
can see only one side of a person
or situation (including RA's and
their jobs) is living in a kind of
one dimensional reality of his own
creation.

I suggest that Mr Schwartz
consider some of the practical
consequences of encouraging the
use of illegal drugs on campus.
These include: i. an‘increasc in
the number of narcotics agents on
campus 2. an increase in busts.
particularly busts by outside po-
lice forces. and 8. a rapid decline
in the size of the University‘s
budget. (In case Mr. Schwartz
didn‘t know it the legislature,
which controls our budget.knows
what‘s going on up here.)

With the exception of fresh-
men. anyonc who doesn't want to
live in a residence hall decsn't
have to. The quads are State
property, where State laws. whe-
ther we like it or not, will be
enforced. People who want to
break the laws have an obligation
to themselves and [he the Univer-
sity not lo do so on campus.

You Won’t Get It

Dear Editors:

In response to Therese Mer-

curio's letter which ends by
asking "Will we get it?". the

answer is quite simply, you won‘t.
Not as long as you think that we
are “first and foremost students."

Perhaps you have concluded
that the University is where our
lives have begun and will end.
Perhaps you are unaware that we
are people which is of far greater
significance than being a student.
Perhaps you think you can say “i
want." and the power hungry pigs
will relinquish their power.

To ask the administration for
what you want is to confirm their
power. the power of the pigs.

When you and all of us stop
saying “1 want.“ and start saying
“It is ours we shall take it." then.
and only then. will we got it. All
for it, for all the people.

New Left Organizing Committee

 

 

Right now on this campus there exists a clear example of the socio»
economic and political system's irrelevant altitude lownrds this
campus, and in a broader view. the population '2; true concerns. With
overcrowded classes. understaffed faculty, rising tuitions ctc.. sunken
gardens are being built in order to provide us with a greater sense of
technological advance. The issues of education and ecology evidently
were not taken into conscdcrution. or (lid not carry milcb weight.

Each of the two gardens will cost many thousands of dollars. and
what the University can expect in return for this expenditure is a
useless. and probably ugly array of flower pols and tiles. What we
need desperately instead. is the construction of classrooms.expanded

departments, funds for work-study progrnms

and numerous other

pressing demands. Someone's “priorilics” seemed to have placed the
need for sunken gardens abch everything else. Although the money

has already been

legislated for this purpose. construction can be
stopped and the money reallocated.

Lately, there has been much talk about ecology. but talking isn‘t
stopping the destruction of our trees and the covering of the earth
with cement. The land hv the social science building could easily be
transformed into a people's park with a little work by an interested
community and very little money. A bag of grass seeds would provide
11 more aesthetic and human landscape than bulldozers and ccncnt

mixers can.

lt is intuitively clear that. something beyond the surface must be
controlling the cunstruclinn of these gardens and of all pollution.
What We face is a system of values that places technology and industry
ubch human life. These values have long dominated the lives of the
members of society and now threaten to destroy them also. Before it's
too late. We must stand up and let the controlling forces. a consumer
orientated industry and its political power structure. know that we
cannot accept their values. Wc'must show that we will not be the tools
ol' an elite who couldn't care less about us. and begin to have human
values replace those that have been imposed upon us. We must get
together and create not a showplucc. but a park for the people,

Speech Pathology Problems

The faculty and the students of
the Speech Pathology and Audio-
logy Dcpurtment met supposedly
to discuss the incendiary issue of
departmental advisory screening
on St. Patrick's Day. What it was.
in actuality, was a performance
well worthy of “Barnum &
Bailey". (But we understand that
their standards run high and
screening would undoubtedly oc-
cur )

For those of you reading this
who don‘t understand what hap-
pened don't worry. you are far
from alone. But now. out of that
heated environment, let‘s ask
some of the questions that were
ignored - let‘s cut the proverbial
crap and get to the mucky bottom
of this deplorable affair.

SOPl-lOMORES -- How can you
sil there and soak up idiotic pro—
paganda worthy of a two week
old orangutang? Why can’t you
see what's going on'.’ Why can't
these questions be answered:

1. What does advisory mean?

2. What will it achieve?

3. What was the faculty vote in
regard to instituting scrcnning'.’

-l. Why is there a shift of
meaning now?

5. What are the real intentions
of the screening?

6. How can you compare it to
Pro-professional Seminur?

7. Will the faculty be willing to
be screened?

8. Who on the faculty is
equipped to play God and decide
how a person will perform in the
future.

9. Which members of the facul-
ty will be on the Student Faculty
Committee?

The screening process was origi-
nally established to assist in re‘
stricting the size of enrollment in
this department. Do you sopho-
mores bclicvc the intention is now
different - and now it's only to see
if you‘ll be good therapists, which
anyone with brains can realize is
impossible to predetermine. Such
a drastic change in thought is
highly indicative of emotional
problems - isn’t that right. Profes-
sors'.’

One more obnoxious activity
musl be discussed - that of faculty
behavior. You speak to us of
professional ethics which sound
more like the Girl Scout code
every day - and you yourselves
prostitute it. The entire staff of
the department was on state last
night and your performance was
smashing.

SOPHOMORES v- These are the
people who will decide if you're
people or not - did you take a
good look?! Whether you can
eloquently create a reply to that

assinine question about Peanuts is
part of the issue. What’s more
relevant, is the person with the
mentality to write such a ques-
tion, will be grading. evaluating,
screening and deciding if you are
ﬁt to enter into the same profes-
sion as he is in.

Kinesis is far from dead es—
teemed faculty. for from dead.
and you exhibited so much that
verballzation was practically un-
necessary. What you think of
yourselves is often displayed in
class much to the disgust of the
students. But what you think of
others should not (according to
one of our distinguished faculty)
ever be voiced or exhibited in
public; it's highly unprofessional.

The vision of lambs being led to
slaughter cannot be dismissed;
The old cliche. “a wolf in sheep's
clothing" cannot be disregarded.
The faculty are definitely human
at best, why let them decide on
your capabilities?

REFUSE SCREENING. REFUSE
COMPROMISE. DEMAND AN
EDUCATION IN YOUR
CHOSEN FIELD“ DEMAND AN
ALTERNATE SOLUTION BE
ESTABLISHED NOWI!

 

 

This is the last issue of the Albany Student Press before Spring Recess.
We will resume publication Friday, April 10, 1970. Take time to celebrate
the miracle of SPRING.
