Mall Project Discrimination

Charged by Walinsky and Eve

by Julian Mathias

Adam Walinsky, candidate for
New York Attorney General and
former Kennedy aide, and As-
semblyman Arthur Eve accused
the state of allowing dis-
crimination against minorities in
the construction of the Albany
mall project at the Unitarian
Church Monday, March 16.

Walinsky and Eve contended
that an opportunity to alleviate
the ﬁnancial burden of poverty‘
stricken families and lighten wel-
fare rolls has been missed because

of the failure to involve sufficient
numbers of workers from ghetto
communities. Jobs in the con-
struction field offer high salaries
despite requiring little education.

According to Eve the tradition-
ally iIliberaI attitudes of the con-
struction unions have succeeded
in keeping the mall work-force
predominantly white. He accused
the union of importing its own
kind of help from Canada, Maine
and California, while an abun-
dance of impoverished workers
are on the local scene.

Special Events Board

Applications for membership
on Special Events Board will open
today and close on Wednesday.
April 16. Special Events Board
coordinates 12 special events on
campus, including Holiday Sing
State Fair, Homecomming and
Wild, Wild Weekend. The Board
plans long-range events, evaluates
past events, attempts to formulate
new events and acts as a ‘sounding
board' which reacts to the desires
of the students regarding pro-
gramming.

The Board is composed of:
a)two co-chairmen for each event,
b)at-Iarge members who function

as recruiters, public relations and
publicity experts; c)officers; and
d)apprentices who do not yet
have enough experience to chair
an event.

Applications can be picked up
at the Campus Center In formation
Desk.

The members of the Board are
expected to plan and execute
their event, help others with their
events, attend Board meetings and
perform other duties as necessary.
The time committment depends
on which event the member is
assigned, but all events involve a
great deal of time right before the
event takes place.

and

Pat Campbell

for University Senate

Walinsky asked for a halt to
construction until an agreement
concerning a work force with a
proper ratio could be reached.
What could be an opportunity to
help alleviate the financial handi-
caps of the ghetto was not being
exploited to the fullest according
to Walinsky.

Following Walinsky's com-
ments, Assemblyman MacFarland
criticized the findings already dis-
cussed. His solution to a possible
discrimination problem within
unions was the enforcement of
existing laws dealing with an
‘overseer.'

Another Assemblyman from
the audience accused Walinsky
and Eve of using meaningless rhe-
toric. At this point communi-
cations broke down as parti—
cipants in discussions insisted on
being heard without returning the
courtesy of listening.

Dialogues

O'Reilly went over Perlmutter's
head and our petitions and fired
Gerry."

The referendum to determine
general policies is slated for Mon-
day. Talk of continuing the strike
is rampant and until all peaceful
channels are exhausted, there is
hope “coolness” will prevail.

“This is Albany-not Buffalo.”
But brothers from U.B. noted that
they had an ovation in response to
our take over of the administra-
tion building and when challenged
from the floor regarding our feel-
ings of their strike, they got an
ovation from the placid silent
majority of students present.

Monday‘s referendum will de-
cide the means of obtaining them.

The Philosophy

of Student Power

Continued from page l2

The department chairmen have
chosen now to consolidate their
power before the new President
Benezet can arrive on campus:
they fear that Bencth may be
actively sympathcric to the just
demands of the student powcr
movement. Unfortunately,
Kuusisto, Thornc, and the present
acting Vice-president for Acu»
demic Affairs O'Rcilly, the cur-
rent members of the upper-
cchclon administration, have a
misguided sense of loyalty to
these new chairmen and have iii-
dicated n nnivcwillingncss to per»
mil. these lower-echelon ndminis
trntors lo continue their unlawful
disfrnncliisemcnt of the studcnls.

The faculty will no longer nc-
ccpl this, they are sick and tired
of being manipulated and conlrol>
led by the diciuroriul whims of ii
chuirmun whose appointment

they have no real power to deter-
mine. The students have warned
Kuusisto and his Vice-presidents
against the naive understanding
that the students will not oust
them (the administration) if the
student demands are not met
now. As the faculty realize that
How is the time to press their
demands for academic freedom
upon the administration, so do
the students realize that. now is
the time to enforce the admin-
istration to acknowledge the invi-
qubIe right of the students under
the system of “natural” laws
which operate in the political po-
wer structure of this university, to
use their power at all the deci-
sion-making levels.

If the administration refuses to
accept the reality of this
philosophy, Ihe studcnls have
commitch thcnisi-Ivcs to u revolu-
lion which will forever remove the
udiiiinislriition from the govern

As Buffalo proves, the students

suspension of state monies so long

FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 1970

Fantasia

by Tom Quigley
In 1940, Walt Disney released
FANTASIA upon the pabulum
fed, pie-World War II public, that
had come to rely on him for

bland, inconsequential family
films, The reception was catas-
trophic.

The audiences could not toler-
ate large doses of classical music,
no matter how familiar or stimu-
lating the animation. Critics
buried it with remorseless criti-
cism failing to understand the
purposes of the experiment, and
the greatest profit-oriented horror
of all the film was a financial
disaster

Having recently viewed it upon
its return from obscurity, I can
only modestly conclude that it is
the greatest animated film ever
produced by the Disney studios, a
pioneer in this field. For ii change
it is satisfying to report that the
public reception of the film was
too harsh and the critics, as usual,
had the farsightedness of a group
of blind asses (which places this
reviewer in a precarious position
but the sarcasm is appropriate).

The Disney animators diligently
use total visual equivalents to il-
lustrate moods and emotions
evoked by a variety of great
musical masterpieces, ranging
from Bach to Beethoven. Using
narrative between the unrelated
episodes continuity and balance
are maintained between the real
and surreal. The culmination of
this noble experiment is a brilliant
human and emotional impression-
istic film that draws chiefly from
naturalistic and surrealistic modes
of expression. If it is not wholly
successful in interpretation, it is at
least honest in its presentation.

For those of you who are not
particularly classical music buffs,
myself included, it is indeed a
pleasure to be visually introduced
and instructed to many of the
more familiar pieces through the
benefit of Disney’s entertaining
artistry. All the episodes are
charming and you are bound to
find yourself with favorites among
them.

Unfortunately it becomes im-
possible to describe the fluidity of
color, image, and sound blended
so skillfully in this film. It must
be seen to be experienced. Among
my own favorile episodes are
“The Sorceror‘s Apprentice"
featuring the mischievous Mickey
Mouse as a novice, dabbling in the
black arts with dirc results; the
incredible violent depiction of the

,- A Bonanza Of
Sight And Classical Sounds

dawn of creation traced through
the volcanic and Jurassic periods;
the idyllic and amusing mytho-
logical sequence done in contrast-
ing monochromatic colors, and
the “Bald Mountain" finale with a
vision of a demonical, titanic
Satan, straight out of Milton,
reveling in the corruption of
eartth souls in an errie hellish
landscape; surly a terrigying de-
parture from the usual Disney
mode of "harmlessness,"

The juxtaposition and contrasts
of good and evil are in fact the
very things that distinguish this
movie above all other Disney crea-
tions. The film recognizes, but
does not overly and piously
moralize about the forces of pow-
er hrutality, beaity, and peace
inherent in natural phenomena
and indeed the human condition
itself. Of course the film is a
strong statement for love but it

does not deny the considerable
power of evil and its dominion in
this world, that sometimes makes
it more powerful than good. The
ﬁnal vision, of natural peace, how-
ever religious in intent, is more
Emersonion and humane than
spiritual.

FANTASIA is a fragile and
pursuasive film that understands
and uniquely illustrates, through
the media of music, color, and
animation, the art of visual com-
munication that has become the
canon of filmmakers and artists of
today. The saddest conclusion of
all is that it was produced by ii
man who was pressured into sub-
merging imagination and the flair
of originality, for the finnnCiaI
security of that cutsic-poo crap
that passes for family entertain.
ment. For those who scoff at the

art of .Disney, this film above all
others Is a must.
