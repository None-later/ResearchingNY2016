Stein Bill Limits

GI Service in Combat Zone

by Robert Schwartz

A week after the Governor of
Massachusetts signed a bill em-
powering the state attorney to
take any necessary legal action to
prevent Massachusetts service-
men from ﬁghting in a combat
zone unless Congress has declared
war, Assemblyman Andrew
Stein, a New York City Democrat,
is fighting to get the New York
State Legislature to pass a similar
bill which he introduced several
Weeks ago.

The bill differs slightly from
the Massachusetts bill as it would
permit New York servicemen to
fight in an undeclared war up to

60 days from the commencement
of hostilities before Congress
would be required to declare war.

By enabling New York service-
men to refuse combat duty with‘
out a formal declaration of war by
Congress within 60 days and by
requiring the State Attorney
General to represent these men in
court, the bill intends to force the
Supreme Court to rule on whether
or not the President of the United
States has the constitutional au-
thority to involve the nation in an
undeclared war as is currently the
case in Vietnam and Laos.

On Tuesday March 30, the Re-

Major Committees

Need Students

Four major committccs at the
University are presently in need of
student representation. They are
the University Governance Com-
mission, the Special Committee
on Faculty Evaluation, the Uni»
vcrsity Parking Appeals Commit-
tee, and the Search Committce for
an admissions director.

The University Governance
Commission will be charged with
restructuring the guidelines for
such organizations as Senate and
Student Association. The commis‘
sion is the immediate successor to
the University Governance Corn—
mittcc.

Six undergraduate students are
needed, for the commission three
of whom 'wouldi be Senators, as
well as three graduate students.

faculty evaluation was conceived
by the Senate to study policies
and procedures for faculty evalua-
tion, and to develop explicit cri-
teria regarding faculty term re-
newal, promotion, and tenure.

In addition to five faculty
members, the committee needs
three undergraduates and two
graduate students. Recommenda-
tions of this group will be sub-
mitted to the Senate also.

Primarily because student ap-
peals are heard, the University
Parking Appeals Committee
would like three student mem-
bers. The group hears appeals con-
cerning parking violations and
views requests for special parking
permits.

The Search Committee for an
admissions director is in need of
two undergraduates. The purpose
of the committee is to screen and
recommend candidates to the
Vice-President for Student
Affairs.

Unrlcrgradtnitcs interested in
these positions should contact
'l‘crry M..thias in CC 346
(457.3430),
and graduates should contact
Charles Stephenson in CC 333
(-157-77tll), as soon as possible.

GOULD

Dr, Samuel Gould announced
his resignation as head of the
State University system last night,
effective October lst of this year.
He gave no reason for resigning.

The trustees of the state system
accepted the resignation with
“profound regret." Gould has
been chancellor for the past six
eurs.

  
   
  
   
 
 

 

 

 

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

N .Y.

publican dominated Assembly
Committee on Governmental
Operations killed the bill and
thereby prevented it from being
brought to the floor for debate.
After this setback, Assemblyman
Stein requested Assembly Speaker
Perry Duryea to reintroduce the
bill in the Assembly Rules Com-
mittee but has yet to receive a re-
ply.

In an attempt to push through
the bill through the legislature As-
semblymun Stein held a press con-
ference in New York City on
April 8 in which he criticized Dur«
yea and Senate Majority Leader
Eari Bridges for preventing debate
on the bill in either house of the
legislature.

Stein and other Democratic
supporters of the bill have sche-
duled a public hearing in Albany
for next Tuesday which will in-
clude testimony from such Demo-
cratic office seekers as Paul
O’Dwyer, Eugene Nickerson,
Adam Walinsky, and Basil Patter-
son. By then Stcin hopes to have
gained enough support in the
legislature to bring the bill to the
floor for debate.

Despite Stein‘s frantic efforts,
chances for passage of the bill are
very slim. Tuesday's hearing will
occur only a few days before the
expected adjournment of the

legislature. Also it is doubtful that

the Republican dominated legisla-
turc would pass a bill which so
directly challenges the Nixon ad-
ministration.

Passover Action;

Hires law Firm to All Students

by Bob Warner

Central Council last night urged
once again that President Kuusisto
close the university for Passover.
In a bill introduced by Dick Wes-
ley, Council requested that classes
be cancelled on April 20, 21, and
22 ‘out of respect for the Jewish
population of this University‘.

In an additional bill, Council
called for a student referendum
on April 13,14,and 15. This refer-
endum will determine student
support of a boycott of classes
during Passover if Kuusisto refuses
to recind his decision to hold
classes.

It should be noted, however,
that Kuusisto and O'Reilly have
asked the faculty not to penalize
students who do not attend class,
and not to hold examinations and
labs those three days.

As a gesture to the ad-
ministration that students are not
irresponsible, Council also stated
in its position statement that they
"re willing to allow the three days

be made up. However, this
wott'd only take effect if Kuusisto
deci led to cancell classes; in other
worr's, if students must boycott
classes to meet their demand, they
will not accept an extended
school year.

The argument against cancelling
classes was that students have
missed too many classes already
(Dialogue, Moratorium. etc.) and
that the teaching schedule is tight
already.

The argument in favor of can-
celling classes was that the Univer-
sity ois discriminating against Jew-
ish students by not permitting
their religious and cultural holi-
days to become University-wide
holidays. Time off for Easter and
Christmas are presently allowed in
the University calendar.

Vote 76-73

Irate Jewish students who
attended the Central Council meet-
ing felt that since 40% of this
school is Jewish, Jewish holidays
should not be discriminated
against.

The referendum on the boycot-
ting during Passover if the Admin-
istration doesn‘t cancel classes will
be held on April 13 (12 - ] p.m.),
14 (l - 2 p.m.), and 15 (2 - 3
p.m.) in tue Campus Center
Lobby. If you would like to assist
in the running of the referendum,
please contact Norm Rich at
457-4077.

In a bill introduced by Dave
Neufeld, Council unanimously
voted to hire, for the student
body at large, the law ﬁrm of
Rosenblum and Leventhal. The
services the law firm would offer
are: legal aid in initial proceedings
with regard to arrest, advanced
draft counseling, advisory opin-
ions, and bi-weekly meetings on
campus. Students may also visit
the lawyers at their office at any
time.

Council also will pay for a
24-hour phone line in case of
arrest, and will provide 10,000
wallet cards which will contain
"Pertinent legal information" on
them.

The purpose of the bill is to
provide the students with the
opportunity to get out of jail on
bail easily in case of arrest, and to
provide students with legal advice
as needed in cases from car acci-
dents to arrest for the possession
of drugs.

Council passed by a vote of
(21-0-1) a bill which endorses the
CURE proposal.

Council also appropriated ex-
pense money for Congressman
Allard Lowenstein to speak here
on April 15.

Allllllllllll PASSES ASSEMBLY

by Barry Kirschner

The Assembly has voted in
favor of the same liberal abortion
bill which was denied passage by
Speaker Duryea's disallowing of
absentee votes last week. The bill
vote was 76 to 73, receiving the
minimum number of votes neces-
sary for passage.

The bill now must be sent to
the Senate which previously has
passed an even more liberal abor-
tion bill. Should it be passed by
the Senate, it will be enacted into
law by Governor Rockefeller's

signature. Rockefeller is on record
as favoring the bill.

The measure provides for abor-
tion on demand up through 24
weeks of pregnancy. The only pre-
requisite for legal abortion would
be consent of the woman and a
physician.

The present abortion law is
over 100 years old and allows
abortion only to save the life of
the mother. Much more conserva-
tive reform measures than the one
just passed have been defeated in
the last three years.

 

Spring has come to the podlum, and the “closed for winter" signs have been packed away. Perhaps the
fountains will be turned on for Parent’s Weekend!
