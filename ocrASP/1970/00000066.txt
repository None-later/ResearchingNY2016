“Every character is. in his own
way. sick, The son has the strong-
esl self-control, and thinks that
his principles are the strongest.
However. he's easily persuaded
and in the end adopts a complete-
ly opposite idcalogy.

'l‘he mother‘s life is built entire-
ly on power. Without power she is
unhappy. She continually manipu-
lates and connives to rule and in
the end her goals are met."

"The father, who was brought
up with certain specific moral
ideas, keeps them solely as a hunt.
In reality. he has the morals. and
is the epitome of the weak Ameri-
can male who can't. hold his own
ground."
