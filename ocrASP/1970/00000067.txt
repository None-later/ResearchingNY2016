John Mayall Provides

Entertainment At Its Finest

by Mark Batten

The obvious problem created
by having two such excellent
groups as John Mayall and the
Moody Blues in one concert is
that one must take second billing.
Sunday March 22 in the gym,
Mayall unfortunately had to fill
this spot. Perhaps this can account
for, in part, the disappointing
brevity of his appearance. While
short, however, the performance
certainly lacked no musical excet‘
Ience or excitement.

Mayall's first number, “The
Laws Must Change," featured the
drive and precise timing that was
characteristic of his entire set. It
was clear that the absence of the
dominating lead guitar and drums
sacrificed no force. The basic
premise of the new format-elec-
tric bass, saxophone, accoustical
guitar and harmonica-- is, in fact,
that each instrument is its own
rhythm section.

While the total sound was cardr

Rascals

nal, Mayall fully realized the capa-
bilities of each member and pro-
vided ample room for solos. These
never became pretentious or bor-
ing as so frequently happens in
live rock or blues. Mayall kept his
own guitar and harmonica work
succinct. Although he used a
standard electric guitar, the pre-
sentation was quiet and articulate.
His harmonica was more aggrcs'
sive, in the same Chicago-based
style which he has been develop-
ing for years. The bass solos were
also imaginative but direct. Jpn
Mark's contribution on aecousti-
cal guitar as far as soloing goes
was minimal. Although it is appar-
ent from his album work that he
is very adept, his short solo in
“California” was bland. It was
Johnny Almond who provided the
most exciting moments with his
saxophone and flute runs, all hav-
ing a strong jazz flavor. They
ranged from subdued aml melodic
to screeching.

Fail To Win Crowd

by Beth .Io Knapke

The Young Rascals who per-
formed on Friday, March 20 were
very exciting and yet Very ostenta-
cious. The selections, “It's a Bran-
tiful Mornin," “How Can I lie
Sure,“ and “Groovin,” had the
sounds of lflti7 aml 1968 and
were appealing only because they
represented the Rascals of most of
our High School days. But the

culling formidable and frequently
little known talent, Mayall in-
cluded in his act Duster Bennett,
"England‘s greatest one man blues
band." Although Bennett looked
at first glance like a joke, stomp-
ing a bass drum and high hat, rap-
idly fingering chords and blowing
a harmonica, his sound was re-
markably full. His interpretation
was in the same vein as Mayall's ,
stressing precise integration of all
the instruments.

The somewhat unsettled at-
mosphere created by the over-
flowing audience which had had
some trouble entering was eased
by the rapport Mayall quickly es-
tablished through his informal ap-
proach. A few bars into their first
song he calmly halted the music
to readjust the mikes. Later, when

FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 1970

John Mayall was one of the few hits of the weekend of concerts
which also featured the Rascals and Canned Heat.

Powerful Track Team Opens Season Wed.

by Dennis Hackett

Albany's young track team is
nervously awaiting their first meet
next Wednesday against Boston
State at home. They have howev-
er, by no means been idle. The
sixty members of the team have
now been practicing for a month
and a half.

Coach Munsey seems pleased
with the progress his young team
is making (there are only six
Seniors). “This could be a real
good team if we iron out a few
events.” He has recently put the
team through a series of time tri-
als to make assignments for the
upcoming meets. As of now there
are many definite leaders in each
event.

The 880 is being led by four

AM

This year APA will again field
another fine softball team. The
defending champs of last year
seem to be the team to beat again
this year. The line up this year
shows 6 returning starters led by
co-captain, catcher Bart Koehler
and ace hurler Ray Wright. Jim
Shea and Steve Thomson are back
at first and second. Les Newmark,
Glenn Gerver, and John Lynch a-
long with newcomer Ed Arseneau
share the outfield duties. Co-Cap-
tain Doug Chesser, who played
with the Renagadc APA League I
team last year and was a solid hit-
ter, will be playing shortstop
while newcomer Bill Motto
rounds out the infield at third.
The line up appears to be solid
with no apparent weakness at any
position. APA will also field a
League I pledge team.

The pledges are led by Tim
Minnehan at shortstop and Pete
Soloway in left field. This team
could provide an unpleasant sur-
prise to everyone.

Sigma Tau Beta‘s entry in
League 1 stands as a strong con~
tender for the league title. Al-
though they lost their starting
pitcher from last year's squad, the
team has picked up a number of
valuable additions to strengthen
themselves. Warren Sabloff, a
transfer from Orange county will
be taking over the pitching chores
while Bob Onofry, another trans‘
fer, is moving in at first base.

Larry Meyers and Mike Pavy,
neither of whom played last year,
but both of whom have competed
in League I before, will be in the
outfield along with Tom Nixon.

Varsity

Season Hampered by Injuries

by Dave Fink

The State lacrosse team opens
its first varsity season Saturday by
hosting Plymouth State in a 10:00
a.m. encounter,

Lacrosse has become something
special here at Albany. After only
two seasons, it has attracted a fol-

IA

The infield will consist of Pat
Mahoney at third, Tom Lind-
strand at short, Marc Sosne, who
played freshman ball last year at
second, Onofry at first and John
Fowler catching.

Nixon, captain of the team,
commented, "If Sabloff can come
through on the mound, and if our
fielding is strong, I think we've
got a good chance for the crown."

This past fall's tennis ladder
tournament was won by Robert
Familant. Bob defeated Larry
Meyers in the finals 7-5,6-0.

lowing which could not have been
imagined three years ago. The
squad, comprised of many juniors
who initiated the club as fresh-
men, has compiled an overall
14-l-l record.

This year, in order for the team
to carry on this tradition, many
obstacles must be overcome.

Firstly, the stickmen will play a
much more difficult schedule than
last year, competing against the
likes of Rochester Tech, Castleton
State, Adelphi, C. W. Post, as well
as Saturday's foe.

Secondly, the most feared nem-
esis has suddenly hit the team -—
injuries. In Tuesday's scrimmage
against RPI, captain Larry Smith
broke a rib as a result of a stiff
check in front of the goal. He will
be lost for at least half the season.
Mid-fielder John Wilcox will be
lost for 2 more weeks with an
injured knee while starting attack-
man Steve Jackway, who scored
32 goals last year, is a doubtful
starter for Saturday's game,due to
a mouth infection. Mark Werder,
another middie who led the squad

Danes Whip RPI

The Great Danes opened their
season on a winning note on Wed-
nesday by downing R.P.I. 5-2.
Albany had the lead all the way as
it scored early and kept RPI score-
less until the ninth inning. Solid
performances were given by pitch-
er Nick Ascienzo, who threw a
four-hitter, and first baseman
Rich Bardeshewski, who chipped
in with a couple of hits. Perhaps
more important though, was the

solid Albany defense, which came
up with a few clutch plays to help
preserve the win. Overall, it was a
poor day at the plate for the
Danes, who only had five hits. But
they managed to make the right
play when needed, which is all a
team has to do to win. Albany
now looks forward to Saturday,
wh'" Oswego will visit here for a
doubleheader.

with 40 goals last season, is a
question mark also.

As if this is not bad enough,
starting goalie Bob Cole will be
playing on a very tender ankle
while Marshall Winkler, a middie,
will be lost for several games with
a badly bruised wrist.

Freshman Jeff O'Donnell will
ﬁll Smith’s spot on attack, with
junior Bruce Sand and sophomore
Andy Egol waiting in the wings.
Freshman Barry Sadoff will fill in
for Werder if the latter cannot
play.

The defense is fairly set with
the three starters to be chosen
from Barry Kolstein, George
’I‘uro, Tom Osterman, and Curt
Smith.

The bright spot on this rather
dreary picture may be seen in the
fact that the game has been
switched to Albany due to poor
ﬁeld conditions in Massachusetts.
The players are very happy with
the move for the sole reason that
they are more comfortable play-
ing at homeuand the reason they
are is because they look forward
to fan support. This is your team-

Tourney

by James McGlynn

The Fourth Annual Judo Tour-
nament, previously slated for the
18th of April, has been moved to
this Saturday, April 11th, begin-
ning at noon. This event, spon-
sored by our SUNYA Judo Club,
will be held in the main gym here
on campus. Tickets will be on sale
Monday through Friday in the
Campus Center Lobby and also at
the door on Saturday.

The tournament will be an all-
-day affair, and viewers may come
and go as they please. Beginning
at noon will be the children‘s
competition, followed by the
women’s competition. From ap-
proximately 2 until 6 the senior
men’s competition and the award-
ing of trophies.

At mid-time intermission, a
black belt demonstration will be
conducted, showing various self
-defense techniques against the
armed or unarmed assailant. Mr.
Moriuasu Kudo, 5th degree black
belt and chief instructor of the
SUNYA and Troy Judo Clubs,
will demonstrate these defenses.

For those who have never seen
a tournament of the marital arts,
it will be a truly unique and
worthwhile experience. Competi-
tion will range from 8 year old be-
ginners to black belt men's catego-
ries. A good time will be shared
by all. For information call Jim:
457-7926.
