Last spring, a proposal to eliminate the general undergraduate degree
requirements at SUNYA was presented to Faculty Senate, after having been
reviewed and approved by the Curriculum Committee and Undergraduate
\ Academic Council of the Senate. The proposal was tabled, primarily be-

Charges against Frank Bonil-
leri, the freshman from Van Cort-
landf. Hall who were arrested for
his actions on March 13th in the
administration building, have bee-
withdrawn at the suggestion of
the administration.

The charge of criminal trespass
in the third degree was withdrawn
on March 25th by the arresting
officer, John Henighan, Security's
investigator on campus.

Michael V. Tepedino, Albany

Against Borzilleri

dismissal of the charges after a

promise wasmade bythe two stu-
dents and a faculty member to re-
imburse the University for the
damages to the administration
building. The cost of repairing the
damages totaled $1 ,024.
Borzilleri, represented by a fac-

three days of recurring incidents
on the Ithaca campus.

Yesterday, some 200 students
attempted to block entrances to
the administration building, and
although campus security police
were available, they were not
used.

Violence had erupted on the
campus Wednesday night when a
group of black students number-
ing about 150 burned looted mer-
chundise in a bonfire. For about
an hour afterwards they roamed
through the campus grounds tos-
sing rocks and bottles through
windows. Corson issued the cur-
few order at about 2:00 am.

Earlier this week, on Monday,
about one hundred studean
marched to the administration
buildingqu presented a list of de-
mands to Corson.

These included :1 permanent

pus security policemen to protect
black housing, and money to re-
build a community center de-
stroyed by fire in September. Cor-
son said most of the demands had
nlrcudy, or were, being met.

When leaders said they were
dissatisfied with this reply, the
group marched to the newly
opened campus store.

Thcrc, n large window was
broken, as was u showcase. Mer-
chandise was scattered around the
store; there was some looting.
There was $4,000 worth of
damage.

Later that day, Corson issued a
statement deploring the violence.
He appealed to the campus com-
munity to bchnvc “with compas-
sion and reason.” Nevertheless,
violence was to tukc plocc Wed-

deployment of the $330,000 cost
into construction of a Day Care
