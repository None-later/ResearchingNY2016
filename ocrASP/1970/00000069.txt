THE PILL

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

The Big; Industry and Medich l'"ofessioii

‘guilty of deception  and mass genocide’

by Nancy Beezley
College Press Service

WASHINGTON--(CPS)--The
safety of women is apparently the
last thing in the mind of the drug
industry. For a decade American
drug companies have been pedd-
ling the birth control pill as a mir-
aculous wonder drug. a deer of
only good and the social behavior
of humanity.

But it seems the pill is some-
what less than that. Since the
beginning of the year, a Senate
committee and a Washington DC.
woman's liberation group haVe
held investigations about the pill.
Testimony indicates at very least
the drug industry and the medical
profession are guilty of deception
and carelessness and at most that
these groups are committing mass
genocide.

It seems that what began as
convenience for men. a casual pre-
scription for physicians and
supposed freedom for womcnuhas
meant only one thing to drug
companies. The birth control pill
equals money.

The drug industry is one of the
most profitable industries in the
country and the birth control pill
is responsible for more lliaii a
small part of that profit. Drug
companits spend more money
promoting than researching the
birth control pill,

in 1957. the hi-‘h control pill
was tested on a group of ."uerto
Rican women. The study was
done to test the effectiveness of
the pill as a contraceptive. not. In
investigate its safety and health as-
pects. What didn't come out of
that study is probably more inili-
cative than what did. liy the end
of three years all women dropped
out of the experiment. There were
five deaths including three sudden
deaths. No thorough analysis was
made on why the women discon~
tinned using the pill. Even lliough
the sudden deaths suggest blood
closts to the lung.llie deaths Were
not revealed. and no autopsys
Were performed.

When the pill was put on the
market in 1960. fewer than 200
women had taken oral contra-
ception for more than a year.

One Indiana physician told Scir
ate committee members. “Several
near tragic examples of throm-
boembolism in form of blooil
clotting) caused me to slow up my
prescribing of contraceptive inedi-
cation six years ago. and finally to
cease totally prescribing the birth
control pill some four years ago."

“But more than any other
problems. I have seen women who
are chronically tired. or depressed.
or lacking in libido. or complain-
ing of frequent migraine-like head-
aches. often of incapacilatiiig iia-

Barbara Seaman, author of The
Doctor’s Case Against the Pill.
said at the women’s liberation
hearing that three separate surveys
indicate that one birth control pill
user in three experiences depres»
sant personality changes--changes
to depression and fatigue. Physi-
cians believe suicide, not blood
clotting, is the leading cause of
death among pill users, she said.

Besides the known side effects
of oral contraception, there are
many unexplored and unanswered
potential effects including cancer.
genetic damage and sterility.

Cancer has a latency period of
from ten to thirty or more years.
An assistant professor of obstet-
rics and gynecology at Johns Hop-
kins University School of Medi-
cine, Dr. Hugh Davis. told the sen»
ate committee that breast cancers
have been induced in at least five
different species of animals by
currently marketed oral contra-
ccptives.

lt isii'l known what effect birllt
conlrol pills have on the t‘eliis.
should a woman forget to take a
pill and then takc two the iicxl
day as the package instructs. Mrs.
Seaman said it is also possible
that, if a woman begins to take
pills while nursing a child. that
child may grow up sterile.

Even though the actual and
potential side effects are so
widespread. a survev by lhe l). (3.
women‘s liberation group indicat-
es that most women are not forc-
warned by llicir physicians. Ball
testified. “in my experience. most
of the women that have seen me
liecallsc of adverse effects from
the pill liaVe not been warned by
the prescribing doctor lhal the pill
can cause iii.porlaiil side effects.

Widespread use of oral contra-
ccptchs has gIVi-n rise to health
hazards on 2i scale "previously un-
known to medicine." “Ni-yer have
so many individuals lakeii such
potent drugs with so little infor-
mation available as to actual and
potential hazards. it is medically
unsound lo adminislcr such
powerful synthetic hormones in
order to achieve birth control ob~
jectives which can be reached by
simpler means of greater safely. .
 Davis said.

The popularity of the pill has
been iliie in great part lo promo
tion by drug companies. l)oclors
often recommend birth conlrol
pills williolit seriously discussing
with llicir patients other lypcs of
contraception. Ilavm said the el‘
fectivcness ol' the pill is grcally
overruled. “liven those who stay

on the pill get pregnant at a one
to three percent rate because of
omission of one or two tablets or
failure of the method itself.”
Some iud's provide a 99 percent
protection against pregnancy and
can be worn by 94 percent of wo-
men. Similar results occur with
use of the diaphram in a well-
motivated population of women,
he said.

Drug companies do what they
can to downgrade all but oral con-
traceptives. Many medical school
courses are taught by drug com-
pany representatives. Elaine Ar-
cher of New York Women's
Health Collective said at the wo-
men‘s liberation bearing that a
few years ago drug companies
bought up patents to several types
of iud's (which. incidentally. are
cheaper than birth control pills).
The drug companies promoted
birth control pills by marketing
poor quality iud's and by not pro-
moting the iud as a valid form of
contraception.

Probably the safest and most
effective form of population con-
trol is use of the ind or diaphram
to prevent contraception and back
up use of therapeutic aborlioii lo
prevent unwanted birth. Japan
and lliilgaria use legal abortion,
not oral contraception, to control
population. Presently. the number
of legal abortions in Japan and
l‘ltlh‘lt‘l‘ll Europe plus the illegal
abortions elsewhere prevent more
births than all methods of contra-
ception combined.

l'Iven lhougli abortion in the
first trimester of pregnancy and
under hospital conditions is medi-
cally safer than pregnancy, llicre
a re only aboill ll states with
"liberalized" abortion laws. In al-
most all of llicse states. abortion
is permitted only in cases involv»
mg rape. incest. gcrmaii measles
and serious medical reasons.

Attorney (laroliiic Nickcrson
said at the women's liberation
hearings tlial women with money
can sometimes get an abortion for
medical reasons by paying large
psychiatric fees. The District of
Columbia‘s abortion law was de-
clared unconslitutional last No-
Vembcr when the judge ruled that
lhe woman has a right to control
her own reproductive Iil'c.

liut. if a woman does not have
money. it is almost impossible for
her to get a legal hospital abor-
tion. Washington's only public

hospital. D. C. General. refuses to
perform abortions.

Legislators who refuse to let
women control their own bodies,
physicians who casually prescribe
birth control, men who refuse to
share the burden of contraception
and drug companies that measure
women in terms of profits are
guilty of exploiting women. The
drug industry is the biggest and
most deliberate exploiter of wo-
men. Since the initial experimen-
tation with the birth control pill.
the drug industry has been care-
less and sometimes even deliber-
atcly deceptive.

Contrary to drug company ad-
vertising, for example. it is a myth
that women who go off the pill
experience an increase in fertility.

Kassouf charged drug manu-
facturers with failure to reveal to
women the risks of the pill. About
pamphlets put out by birth con-
lrol pill manufacturers. Kassouf
said. “Some of the pamphlets this
lead and niisinforni; others are
frankly dangerous. but all haVe
one thing in common: They all
seem to disparage, the reader's
right to know,"

"Is there perhaps a sexual
double standard or scx discrimina-
tion that works in this seeming in-
sistence of our medical profession
to force the pill on women rather
than men‘.’ is the pill safe elimiin
for women. but a male contra-
Ccptive pill is not safe enough for
men? The simple fact that women
have the babies should not mean
that they should be discriminated
against by being the only ones
subjected to chemical contra-
ception. is there anyone here that
would guess how many men
would take a male sterility pill if
the list of possible side effects
were make known in advance?"
one physician asked.

Lollplcﬂ w1t.b prescription and
promotion of the pill has been dis
regarde.’| for women. As one wo-
man pul it. “They neVer thought,
about what the pill would do to
us women. . . It is genocide on
Black people. poor wliilcs and wo-
men."

"For the first time in medi-
cine’s history. the drug industry
has placed at our disposal a
powerful. disease-producing clie-
mical for usc in the healthy rather
than the sick,” one doctor said.
The drug industry seems to be
iiiilcli busier counting money than
lives.

Morse Accuses Administration
of Deceiving Americans

by David Peck

Senator Wayne Morse accused
the Nixon administration of “de-
ceiving the American people" and
ruling by “executive secrecy". He
said that Nixon is “denying to the
American people what they are
entitled to know."

The former Senator from
Oregon spoke before a crowd of
200 people last night. He is a visit
ing professor in the SUNY system
for this year and will be on cam-
pus for the next two days. He has
taught for 21 years. 13 of which
he spent as dean of a law school in
his home state. He was ii Senator
for 24 years.

Morse was one of the two Sena-
tors who voted against the Tonkin
resolution. He stated that the
Senate has recently found that the
Maddox was really a spy ship and
the North Vietnamese had a right
to ﬁre upon it. Morse claims that

Calendar,No Passover Vacation
Announced at. Press Con erenee

by Liz Elsesser

Passover and future calendars
were the main topics discussed
yesterday at the presidential press
conference. Dr. Kuusisto was not
present as he was in Pennsylvania
attending a Middle States Evalutr
tion Accredation Meeting. Clifton
Thorne. Vice President for Stu-
dent Affairs presided.

Thorne informed those present
that former Senator Wayne Morse
is presently on campus. He lec-
tu red Monday night on “The
Future- of American Policy in
Southeast Asia." The Graduate
School of Public Affairs is respon-
sible for his visit here.

The fire last Thursday night in
Eastman Tower was mentioned,
but as of yet the cause is still
undetermined. The residents of
the tower were commended for
their efficient evacuation.

Last week's question concern-
ing legislation on public order on
campus was answerer]. Since that
time. the Assembly passed. with a
large majority. ii measure requir-
ing colleges and universities to sus-

Commission lists

pend students if they are convict-
ed in a court of record for any
campus unrest. This period could
be as high as 5 years. The SUNYA
administration. however, opposes
this measure as “we do not want
an external body exerting control
over the university."

Finally. the main issues of Pass-
over and the calanders were
brought up for discussion. Al-
though a representative body
voted to close schools. it will stay
open. This decision was made by
the President after consulting with
three rabbis and the executive
committee of the Senate.

When questioned as to why the
vacations are centered around
Christian holidays; Thorne ans-
wered that these holidays are al-
ready legal iiational holidays.

Much discussion continues around
the question of penalization for
not attending classes. A few felt
that missing lectures alone is a
penalty.

 

It was also brought up that
Eastern Orthodox students will
not have their Good Friday which
comes on April 24 th. either.

Looking ahead to mext year's
calendar. it was evident that Rosh
Hashonoh and Yom Kippur will
be scheduled clam days as well.
This is unavoidable since the State
Education Dept. mandates that a
minimum of 14 full weeks are
necessary for a complete semester.

At the present time we will on-
ly be able to have Thanksgiving
off. and no reading days are sche-
duled for the fall semester.

Also the class schedules have
been changed to n Mon. Wed. Fri.
schedule instead of Mon. Tues.
and Thurs. This. according to
Thorne, was effected to facilitate
maximum scheduling since that is
now a major problem of the Uni-
versity.

Dr. Thorne voiced his interest

a.

“if Johnson had told the Foreign
Relations Committee 50% of the
truth. the Tonkin Resolution
would never have passed."

The Senator is completely a-
gainst our involvement in Viet-
nam. He believes that we violated
the Geneva Accord, the U.N.
Charter. and the US Constitution
when we became involved in Viet-
nam.

Morse wants us to call an im-
mediate cease fire. ask the U.N. to
enforce it and then let the U.N.
make a decision on Vietnam.

Nixon is not getting us out of
Southeast Asia, according to
Morse. Nixon has not repudiated
“the two crooks Thieu and Ky"
and has never said he will end our
“economic support" of their re-
gime. “You can't maintain peace
with bullets. that’s jungle law"
was the Senator's response to our
current policies in Asia.

“We've put the domino theory
in reverse. We’re knocking down
those countries."

Morse thinks that we ought to
look into our involvement in
Laos. Thadand. and Cambodia. He
claims that we are paying Thai

mercenaries. gradually involving

April 1 5

Cambodia in the Vietnamese war
and fighting a major air war in
Laos.

Senator Morse doesn’t believe
that we are being told the truth in
many cases. The Executive is the
most powerful ‘branch in the
government and this power is
being abused. He said that the
“government has not been telling
you what you should know asfree
men and women. There is no sub-
stitute for the full public dis-
closure of the public's business.”

Massachusetts has just passed a
bill which states that it will not
send any of its citizens to fight in
an unconstitutional undeclared
war. A recent bill has been intro-
duced in the New York Legis-
lature. Senator Morse said that
states have no right to tell the
Federal government what wars
they will allow their citizens to
ﬁght in. The therefore believes
that this bill is unconstitutional.

He believes that a Senator must
exercise his honest and individual
judgment. This is why he lost his
Senate seat. He is a dove from a
hawkish state.
