Speaks at Black Weekend

by Stuart Hayman

On Friday afternoon, the first
day of the First Annual Black Cul-
tural Weekend, the Third World
Liberation Front presented
Horace I'Iolllday, former body-
guard of the late Malcolm-X.

Speaking before a group of
thirty to forty black students, Mr.
Hollidny made it quite clear that
he does not cure for any of the
black programs now in effect.
"No program does the job that we
have to do. Each program is set up
not to go anyplace."

He is of the view that the only
way to solve the black problem is
to unify all the separate black fuc-
lions in this country. “In unity we
have 1| chance to survive. One
uniLcd people....this is going to be
the key."

Using the American Civil War
as rm example, Mr. Hollidny feels
that there will first have to be a
fight between the opposing groups
and whichever is victorious will be
the one under which the blacks
will unify.

Black Nationalist Party, Mr. Hol-
liday feels very strongly about the
use of killing us a means to an
end. “I believe in the kill thing."
He feels, however, that most
blacks aren‘t able to follow his
way of thinking. Because they
fear bleeding and dying, he sees
no black revolution for quite
some time, simply because revolu~
tion means killing and being
killed.

Most of Mr. Hollidny’s hopes
seem to be centered around the
realization of a black nation, or
even better. an all black Africu.

would hold a dominant position.

Cannot

Give Child Care

Members of the Day Care Cen-

ter Committee of the Women's

Liberation Movement met with

Vice President for Student Af-

fairs, Clifton Thome, Thursday,

April 9 at 2 p.m. The meeting was

to report the results ofa quest for

information about the legal and
ﬁscal possibility of day care at. the
university.

Meeting with Dr. Thornc were
Dr. Seth Spellman, special assis-
tant to the President; Miss Cecile
B. David from the School of So-
cinl Welfare. Ed Taubman from
Education Policies Council, Mrs.
Carol Bienocki, Mrs. Liz Ewen,
Maxine Dnshkoff, and Mrs. Bar-
bara Pclton, chairman of the com’
mittec.

Dr. Thorne reported that the
President had contacted the
Unversity Council, this institu—
tion's governing body, and the
State University of New York
Central Administration. Both
groups have noted that under the
legal provisions constituting the
university, its funds and facilities
cannot be used for the purpose of
child care. It was pointed out that
other governmental agencies are
so constituted by the state and, in
order to preserve taxpayers funds,
facilities cannot be duplicated.

The State University at Albany
can assist in solving the problem
by providing information about
other possibilities and assisting in

No, KEEP COUSINS is not the
title of a play as some students
mistakenly believe. Vicki Zeldin,
leader of the crusade, attempted
to explain the aims of the move-
merit.

A group of interested students
have circulated petitions request-
ing that the question concerning
granting of tenure to Peter Cou-
sins, instructor in English, be rc~
opened. The students feel that by
not grunting Cousins tenure, the
University will suffer n great loss.

The petitions, signed primarily
by those students who have had
or who presently have cousins as
an instructor, were submitted to
the Student‘s Advisory Council of
the English Dcpanmcnl. A meal-

of Social Services can help with
day care if a parent applies to his
office. There are uptown and
downtown facilities, but the avail-
able accommodations are limited.

The Senate and Assembly are
joining the federal government in
promoting the concept of day
care and plans for this are being
prepared, which would provide
federal and county support if par-
ents were unable to bear the cost.

Professor David reported that
the university would not be eligi-
ble for any assistance from the
State Department of Social Ser-
vices for the financing of a day
care center.

However, private individuals
can form a private non-profit or-
ganization to establish and main-
tain one. The corporation would
be eligible to apply for a loan to
purchase land and a building
which could not be on state uni-
versity property.

The cost of child care and am-
ortization of the loan could be fig-
ured at about $40 per week per
child. Parents unable to pay that
cost may apply for assistance with
County Social Services Depart-
ments. The results of the ques-
tionnaire, circulated in surround-
ing counties at the end of March,
regarding a day lure center re-
vealed that out of .1 total 5760
questionnaires distributed (1920
to faculty and staff and 3840 to

students), 551 were returned, 293
from faculty and staff, and 258
from studean.

A total of 310 responses indi-
cated that they were in favor of
