I. t‘ ' '
- 'The 'Albany State Varsity Base-
ball team brought their record to
2-1 on Saturday by splitting a
doubleheader with Oswego. The
Danes came out gunning in the
first game as they jumped. on
Oswego for two runs in the bot-
tom of the first, courtesy of out-
fielder Rich Spiers. Second base-
man Rod Dunbar led the bottom
of the first with a triple up the
alley in right-center and finally,
after two were out, came around
on. Spiers' towering 370 foot
homer over the left-eenterfield
fence. After that, it was never
eally much trouble for the Danes
to handle highly touted Oswego,
as Hy Dolittle held them in check
the rest of the way, scattering five

hits. The final score was 6-2.

The ballpliiyers were fighting
the wind and cold all afternoon on
a day which was quite unfit to
play baseball. By the time the
second game started, the tempera-
ture had dropped to about :15 rte-
grees with a 20 mile per hour
wind. Bats were stinging and balls
were dropping in a sloppy second
game as a result of the adverse
weather conditions. But the wear
ther must not be held as an excuse
for the poor Albany pitching the
the second game, who were is-
suing walks to Oswego batters like

owégo 6-2 in-

they have the sticks and the de-
fense to rival any team in their
class. But pitching will make the
difference between a good season
and an outstanding one. Bright
spots so far on the pitching staff
have been southpaws Nick
Ascicnyo and Hy Dolittle; but
more help must be given by jun-
iors Howie Smith and Tom Pe-
kich, seniors Spiers and Bor-
dechewski.

If the hurlers a, any handled
by star catcher Jim Sandy, can
come through, some post season
games might be in order for the
Danes.

Sailing Club Competes
in Middle Atlantic Match

The SUNYA Sailing Club sent
its freshman team to Cornell Uni-
versity this past weekend to com-
pete in the Middle Atlantic Spring
Freshman eliminations. Skipper-
ing for Albany were Chris Follows
and Dan Levin. Sandy Graff and
Gail Henry served as crews.

In their first intercollegiate re-
gatta, the frosh sailors placed
third over a field of six schools.
First place was shared by Colum-
bin and Hobart; the remaining
ﬁnishers were Albany, Cornell,
West Point, and Marist, respective-
ly. The Hamilton and NYU teams
forfeited.

The strong winds and freezing
temperatures which prevailed on

Cayuga Lake over the weekend
made for active sailing. In the ﬁrst
race alone, four out of six of the
light-weight Grumman Flyer sail-
boats were unable to finish be-

cause of capsizing or mechanical
breakdowns. The remaining eleven
races were equally grueling.

By placing third, Albany has
qualified to compete along with
qualifiers from two other elimina-
tions in the Freshman Champion-

ship to be held at the Naval Aca-
demy at Annapolis. Last month
the Sailing Club began its season
with an intersectional team race at
King's Point. Representing Albany
were Jon Sargalis and Glenn
Faden. There are six more regattas
scheduled for this spring. Next
week the club will travel to Mari-
time College for a regatta with
Rutgers and Cornell.

LACROSSE

The Albany State lacrosse team
was defeated Saturday in their
varsity debut 12-7 by a strong and
well-drilled team from Plymouth
State, New Hampshire. The stick-
men got off to a slow start as they
trailed 5-2 at the quarter and 9-5
at halftime. The third quarter was

Albany's as they tallied twice
and Held Plymouth scoreless. But
a series of bad breaks and penal-

ties, as well as stalling by Ply-

  

 .e. e:

competition was ﬁerce.

 

State hosted a .Iudo tournament Saturday. As shown above, the

 

mouth. put the game out of roach.
Mark Warrior and Mike Bar-lotto
each lud two godgi—Twhtle Bruce
Sand, Butch McGuerty and Steve
Jakway had one each. A fine per-
formance was tu'rned in by Kevin
Shechan (midﬁelder) whose con-
stant hustle got Albany poneuion
of many ground balls. Goalie Bob
Cole had twenty saves and most
of the goals scored against him
were in “one on one" situations
between the attacker and the goal-
ie.

The team was shaken by a
string of injuries and events that
prevented it from being at full
strength. Losing attackman Larry
Smith. last year's high scorer (60
points) for at least half the season
has not helped things; but. the
team is working hard together and
because of their scoring balance,
the stiekmen should do really
well. The next game is away at
Castelton State, Vermont. on Wed-
nesday. The next home game is
Saturday at 2 p.m. against a tough
Adelphi squad. Returning to the
lineup on Wednesday and Satur-
day will be Tom Mullin (midﬁeld-
er) and John Wilcox (attackman)
both of whom should help on of»
fense and defense. With the team
almost at full strength. Saturday’s
contest should be a good one.
