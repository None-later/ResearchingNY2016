Parking Regulations
Questioned byLooper

The following two letters are in
regard to the parking regulations
recently set by the University.

Dr. Milton C. Olson

Vice President
Management and Planning
Administration 326

With regard to our conversation
yesterday, there seems to have
been a mistake concerning the al-
location of parking spaces to com-
mutcrs. The bill states that aisles
l.2 and 3 and aisles 2 and 3 of the
student sections of Dutch and
State Quadrangles respectively
were to be reserved for commuter
students use. The mistake on
Dutch Quad was that the com-
muters were allocated aisles l and
4. I don't know whether the aisles
on State Quad were allocated pro-
perly or not. it would be very
helpful if you could rectify this
mistake as soon as possible and
withhold giving out parking tickv
cts or warning until this mistake
can be corrected and this policy
can be fully explained and publi-
cizcd.

Also I agree with you on your
idea that resident students that
must lISl‘ their cars everyday to go
to work, student teach etc. should
be given a special pass that allows
Lheni to park anywhere in any

get involved!

Applications are now available for

aisle of the student lot.

This bill was passed by Living
Area Affairs Commission, 15 in
favor, 3 against and 3 abstentions
and was also passed in a straw
vote by Central Council and thus
received Central Council's sup-
port.

Enclosed you will find a copy
of the bill.

Sincerely,
Victor K. Loopcr, Vice President
Student Association

To: Victor K. Looper
From: Milton 0. Olson

Date: March 2. lil70.

The allocation of splices to
non-commuting and commuting
students was done a basis of a
very careful estimate of the
amount of space needed for each
group. i suggest that resident stu-
dents who must use their cars
cVery day for work or student
teaching or related activities apply
to the Parking Appeals Committee
for a special pcrtnil to park any
where in the student lots.

in the meantime, we have asked
Mr. lluckhoff to have his men re-
frain from giving parking tickcls
in the student lots until the resiv
(lent students needing their cars
have ll chance to apply for special
permits.

faculty-Student
Committee

by Wendy Matthy
. and Miriam Rubel

The Speech Pathology and
Audiology Department in an ef-
fort to further understanding and
improve communications between
students and faculty has voted to
form a Student Faculty Commit-
tee composed of two students
from each class year. two graduate
stduents, two faculty members of
the student's choice and three ad-
ditional faculty members.

The first meeting of this group
took place on Wednesday, March
25. At that time, the following
ideas were presented for consi-
deration:

1. That a poll be taken in all
Freshmen, Sophomore, and Jun-
ior Level SAU courses to deter-
mine the specific number of SAU
majors.

2. That a list of requirements
for an SAU major be posted on
the SAU bulletin board outside
HU 317, the official place for all
intra departmental communica-
tions. A permanent list of mem-
bers of the Student Faculty Com-
mittee will be left there.

3. That the students receive i
written guarantee that they will
be signed into closed SAU courses
for Fall 1970.

4. That a written statement be
issued stating that screening is
voluntary and evaluative and will
not be used quantitatively for any
student presently enrolled in this
University. A list of procedures to
be used in screening will be made
available also.

i"). That an introductory semi~
nar course be considered. Such
could serve as a prerequisite to
any 300 level SAU course. Stu-
dents would Visit and observe
work at Northeastern Speech Cenv
ter, Inc.

Parade,Trash-in,Fa'

Highlight Earth Day

Across the nation Wednesday,
April 22 has been designated
“Earth Day,” the alias for the
much-publicized environmental
teach-in which has been planned
as another public demonstration
of sentiment and is expected to
approach the fall anti-war mora-
toriums in the level of participa-
tion. Estimates are that about
1000 colleges and universities and
4,000 high schools will hold
“Earth Day" demonstrations.

An Earth Day Parade, Saturday
April 18, in downtown Albany
will initiate the local teach-in acti-
vities. The parade is sponsored by
the members of the Protect Your
Environment (PYE) Club at
SUNYA and is “a march for En-
vironmental Awareness."

The line of march will form in
Capital Park at 10:30 Saturday
morning, and will pass by the ca-
pitol up Washington AVenue, and
into Washington Park. Albany
Mayor Erastus Corning will ad-
dress the marchers briefly on gov-
ernment participation in the envi-
ronmental clean-up program and
then will help with the “Trash-
In."The parade will be held in
conjunction with as many local
colleges, schools, and community
groups as possible.

A “Trash-In” in Washington
Park will be a “sweep through the
park to pick up papers, bottles,
cans, and other remains of people
living without environmental
awareness."

PYE organizers welcome all to
join the parade but have made
three stipulations: no motor ve-
hicles will be permitted, all floats

must be handdrawn or drawn by
animals, and at the end of the pa-
rade, all materials in the ﬂoats will
be sorted and sold for scrap.

Before the parade a requiem
for the internal combustion en-
gine will be said by Father Fred
Ermlich.

During this week SUNYA stu-
dents and PYE members will be
administering a poll to acquaint
PYE with community attitudes
toward the environmental crisis
and environmental actionI and to
establish communication between
PYE and the community.

The poll will be administered in
the Albany area in the vicinity
near the campuses. Those polled
will receive a consumer action
sheet and a schedule of teach-in
activities at SUNYA.

Plans are still being formulated
for Earth Day activities. Speeches
and question and answer sessions
will be given by State Attorney
General Louis Lefkowitz, and
Representatives Richard Ottinger
and Dan Button.

There will also be an Environ-
mental Fair Wednesday with vari-
ous multi- media exhibits and ac-
tivities such as folk singing and
continuous film showings.

There will be picketing at T0-
bin‘s Meat Packing Wednesday af-
ternoon to protest the industrial
pollution which is especially
damaging to our local water re-
sources.

Anyone interested in helping or
finding out more about teach-in
activities should stop by the PYE
table in the Campus Center lobby
or go to Fine Arts 218.

Nixon to‘Tighten Surveillance’

of Left Wing

An ASP Essay oy Al Senia

Item One: The Nixon Adminis-
tration will soon order a tighten-
ing of surveillance of left wing
radical groups, according to a
front page story in “The Sunday
New York Times The crack
down will primarily involve in-
creased use of undercover agents,
informers, and wiretaps.

The author of the article,
James N. Naughton, states that
President Nixon has become con-
cerned with the recent surge of
nationwide bombings, bomb
scares, courtroom disruptions, and
what Naughton describes as
“small but growing numbers of
young people who feel alienated
from the American system.”

He goes on to say that the
Nixon Administration sees its
primary duty as "protecting the
innocent from ‘revolutionary ter-
rorism‘ ". The government can be
expected to aim for an increased
awareness on the part of the pub-
lic for increased national security.

According to Naughton, the
nation's intelligence system will
need to be updated, since it is
now geared to catching organized
Communist groups (rather than
dealing with the hit—run tactics of
the disorganized radicals).

Also, it is probable that. the
Justice Department will increase
its funding of the Law Enforce-
ment Assistance Administration
(LEAA).

The LEAA is it federally
financed program through which
the Justice Department “assists”
local officials in apprehending
radical elements (or, as our presi-

dent describes them, ((potential
murderers».

Why is the administration pur-
suing this course? Naughton
quotes one official assaying: “We
are facing the most severe internal
security threat this country has
seen since the Depression." And
conservative advisors feel that any
attempt to “win over" young radi-
cals through draft, welfare, or e-
lectoral reforms will prove futile.

Just last month, Nixon called
for broader Federal jurisdiction
and stiffer penalties in bombing
cases.

ltem two: As a SUNY student
unity conference prepares to open
tomorrow at the University of
Buffalo (with no representation
from Albany State), it is inter-
esting to note a report in yester-
day's “Times”.

Some 200 conservative faculty
members have met and formed a
committee (Committee for a Uni-
versity) as their own sign of unity.

The purpose of this group is
“to press for toughter admin-
