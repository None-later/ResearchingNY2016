protesters will carry signs and dis-
tribute leaﬂets.

National SANE leaﬂets will
point out that 64.8% of each tax
dollar is for military expenditure,
while only 17% is for “human re-
sources". The leaﬂet states that
the US. has poured more than a
trillion dollars into the military
since the end of WWII, and that
one-tenth of this amount has been
for Vietnam.

As for actions on the Albany
Campus itself for moratorium

Violence Increases
In CampusProtest

CHICAGO--(CPS)--”Major in-
cidents" of campus protest have
occurred at the rate of one a day
during the first quarter of 1970,
according to the Urban Research
Corporation. Although some con-
sider this academic year more
calm than last, the statistics show
that 92 campuses experienced
major unrest this winter compared
to 88 during the same period last
Year.

The protests were “not signifi-
cantly less violent" than last year
nor did they draw fewer partici-
pants, according to John Naisbitt,
president of Urban Research. He

Survey Reveals Favorable
Attitude Toward Marijuana

DEL MAR, CALIF.--(CPS)—-A sur-
vey of more than 600 drug re-
searchers, psychologists, and
physicians revealed a high percent-
age of them believe marijuana
should be as available as alcohol
to the public.

However, a majority of those
survey felt LSD should be legally
available only for research pur-
poses. Very few said psychedelic
drugs should be available by pre~
scription.

The ﬁndings also revealed a
sharp difference of opinion on the
effects of marijuana use between
researchers familiar with psyche-
delic drugs and practicing physi-
cians and psychologists.

The survey appears in the April
issue of Psychology Today in an
article by Dr. Walter Houston
Clark of Newton Theological
Seminary in Andover, Mass. Dr.
Clark found: ‘

Supervised use of marijuana in
the manner alcohol use is super-
vised is rated as very safe by bit
per cent of the researchers but by
only 39 per cent of the practicing

professionals. However, even the
researchers are far from unani-
mous about the safety of unsuper-
vised use of marijuana: only 19
per cent of the researchers and 10
per cent of the professionals re-
gard it as ‘very safe."'

The magazine surveyed 127
professionals having first-hand
knowledge of drug research and
490 physicians, psychologists, and
psychiatrists who have not done
such research. A key finding in
the drug survey is that an “infor-
mation gap exists between the
two groups" on drug usage.

In general, author Clark noted,
“We have arrived at a state of ab-
surdity in a corner of American
Science: most research with hal-
lucinogenic or psychedelic drugs is
being done under grossly un~
scientific conditions by totally un-

trained men and women, often
students, who ingest substances of
dubious purity."

A high percentage of both pro-
fessional groups-~62 per cent of
the practitioners and 82 per cent
of the researchers-felt the Federal
government should encourage sci-
entific study of drugs much more
than it does now. This view has
particular relevance in light of re-
cent expressions by the Justice
Department to enter the area of
psychedelic drug research.

The overall results of the
Psychology Today survey suggest
that professionals who have done
research on hallucinogens regard
them as less dangerous and thera-
pcutically more promising than do
the professionals who have not
done research.

And it couldn’t
happen here.....

by Al Senia and Vicki Zeldin

The University will prosecute
any students involved in the vio-
lence at Colonial Quad dining hall
Wednesday night if they can be
identified, according to ii state-
ment by the University last night.
H. David Villi Dyck of the Com-
munity Relations office stated:
‘In line with University policy
covering destruction of its proper-
ty. any studcnts positivcly idcnl-
il'icd ..ii| bc priisccutcd."

It also uppcnrcd curtain that
charges would be pressed against
thr- biuck student implicated in
the striking of a food service
supervisor at the same quad Sun-
duy afternoon. This. is u a civil
action being handled in the
Albany courts independcnt of the
University community.

However officials in the E.O.P.
program have been pressuring the
supervisor to drop the charges and
let the University handle the in-
cident. As of late last night, it
appeared almost certain that she
would not consent to this. E.0.P.
posted the $100 bail needed to
free the student.

Meanwhile, a group of black
students met yesterday morning
with President Kuusisto, who had
just returned from a meeting in
Pennsylvania. The students de-
manded that all charges be drop-
pcd and the supervisor involved be
dismissed. The president was given
a three hour deadline which cx-
pircd at 1:00pm yesterday after-
noon. It can be assumed that Van
Dyck's stutcnicni lust niglil was ill
lcnsl an unofficial reply to thc
demands. llis statement went on
to say that the charges arising out
of Sunday‘s incident are “an in-
dividual and not in university nint-
tci' “

The two dcmnnds wcrc ulso prc‘
scnlcd to Peter Haley, an assistant
food scrvicc director. He rejected
them, also claiming that his office
had no control over church
brought by it private citizen pend-
ing in a civil court. He also said
the supervisor would not be fired.

complained about racist com-
ments aimed at black girls by
kitchen stuff helpers.

They tried to show how blacks
rcscntcd the “double standard"

ically, the blacks claim that food
checkers, many of whom are fra-
tcrnity and sorority members, ul»
lowcd friends to go through the
food lines for free meals-but did
notdo the same for blacks.

Students also brought out how
some food checkers make it a

blacks because “they all look the

for many months. Either those in
authority were too blind to see
the approaching Armageddon--or
chose not to. Nevertheless, it had
been a long time coming. And the
problem of countering it fell in
many cases to the R.A.'s who
were not equipped to handle it.

So, the New Left people were
trying to explain this to the stu-
dents soaking in the noonday sun.
“Yes,” they said, “people were
hurt but people don't. go around
beating up other people just for
the hell of it. There is something
very wrong somewhere under-
neuth."

“People shouldn't say it (the
beating of an R.A. Sunday after-
noon) is an individual thing done
by angry black people," one
NLOC member said. "They have
to understand the environment,
the abuse, the fact that Black
Panther brothers are being shot to
death in Chicago."

“I just can't condone what hap-
pened,“ one girl said when he
finished. “l'm sorry, but when
people get beaten up. that's too
much. l‘ve had enough of this
shit!"

She was asked what she would
do about it. For in second she
paused, at it loss for words. Then
she spoke. “l'm going to transfer
out of this place next year."
