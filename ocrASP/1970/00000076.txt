Stein’s Bill
Vietnamese War

by Bob Wanier

The South Room of the DeWitt
Clinton Hotel in Albany was the
gathering place of legislators, can-
didates, academicians, students,
and politically active citizens for
an open hearing on the constitu-
tionality of the Vietnam war.

Assemblyman Andrew Stein, the
sponsor of a bill which would
prevent men from fighting in an
illegal war, and Senator
Ohi'enstcin, the bill's sponsor in
the Senate, chaired the hearing.

The purpose of Stein's hill is to
test. whether the President can
commit thousands of men to war
without a formal Congressional
declaration of war. This anti-war
effort is not, Iith'Ver, according
to Stein, a substitute for other
forms of protest, but. merely a
tll'w dimension.

In his introductory speech, Stein
accused the Republicans in Al»
hull)! of "playing petty politics."
This was it reference In Speaker
Duryczi who has been unwilling to
let this hill out of (Toinrnitlec so
that it may be debated. Hti-in also

Next to publicly support the

ate. Said O'Dwyer. “We are in
Laos and Cambodia already." He
gich as one reason for our pre-
sence in Southeast Asia that. our
government. intends "to maintain
corrupt government In ofﬁce."

O'Dwycr promised to make the
war an issue in the 1970 primary
race, and commented that ’I‘ed
Sorenson came out against. the
Stein bill.

Rev. John Wells, the originator
of the Massachusetts bill, in his

ing at RH, and an opponent of

for the end of hypocrisy in gov-

-does not detract from the moral
issues involved in the war issue.
Cohen said that Congress is at
fault as much as the President,
because Congress has been ap-
propriating money for an illegal
war.

Professor I'Iill’l‘y Staley, also of
SUNYA, and a member of the
executive board of Albany SANE,
called Vietnam an "undeclared,
morally repugnant war," and sold
that the war must be fought on
many levels.

Two SUNYA students spoke on
behalf of the bill, SteVC Villuno,
President. of campus NDC and a
Univorsity Senator, and Drive Neu-
fcld, Chairman of the Political and
Social Positions Committee of
Central Council. Villimo asked the
N.Y.S. Legislature to legitizimize
wur resistance by passing Stein's
bill. Neufeld emphasized the
“irony” of those who concern
themselves with the murdering of
fetuses, yet, it. is these same peo-
ple who (for the most part.) cori-
dune the killing of nineteen year
olds in Vietnam. He said that if

Grassroots

by Ingrid Hansen

Allard K. Lowenstein, Congress-
man from Nassau County's Fifth
Congressional District, spoke to a
group of approximately two
hundred persons here on Wednes-
day night. Lowenstein came into
national prominence two years
ago as the organizer of the “Dump
Johnson" movement.

Lowenstein related some of his
experiences as a member of the
House Agriculture Committee
during the past fourteen months
as indicative of the “non-
functioning" of that institution.

He cited the seniority system as
the primary roadblock to initiat-
ing necessary change through the
legislative process. The seniority
system and the committee system,
whose vested interests seniority is
protecting, have become so “ossi-
ﬁed,” according to Lowenstein,
that it is impossible to get hear-
ings on many issues, including the
draft. He also called for investiga-
tion of “conflicts of interest"
which influence Congressional de-
cisions.

The Congressman said the “basic
nightmare" in this country is “the
people do not know what the
facts are." This he interprets as
causing a “distortion of what is
real" between Congress and the
country.

Because of this luck of know-
ledge, he believes that the people
often react against changes which
are necessary to salvage the coun-
try.

anonstein accused the Nixon
Administration of co-opling
“liberal” vocabulary to deceive
the people into believing that he
was fulfilling his campaign pro-
mixes. This tactic is especially
noticeable in the Administration‘s
program of troop withdrawal.
Nixon was said to he “overtaking
Lyndon Johnson in incredibility."

The basic theme of the speech
was that there must be a grass
roots movement wliereinrpeople
arc availed of the facts. I'Ic dis-
missed the importance of party
labels iind urged support for Con-
gressmen who will speak out
against the war and military up
propriutions. Lowr-nsleln urges
students not. to underestimate
their political impact. which was
significant two years ago. He sees
an opportunity to consummate
the political gains which were
thwarted in MISS.

A mmnbcr of the audit-nee asked

Movement

Lowenstein if he thought it was
possible that his position as a
Congressman had so limited his
perspective that he could not see
the possibility that the present
structure could not solve the na-
tion’s problems. Lowenstein re-
plied that he did not reject the
possibility that perhaps the sys-
tem has become too ossified to be
effective.

However, he belieVes that with
certain reforms in the structure of
our society, there is hope that
problems can be solved. He noted
that he has not. heard any other
proposed programs that offer the
“remotesl. hope of change.“

Council Probes
Racial Issue

By Bob Warner

Central Council, in a bill intro-
duced by Bert Eversley, set up a
“multi-racial student committee
that will officially investigate and
report on incidents and attitudes
of racism" on this campus.

The bill is a direct reaction to
the disruption at dinner at the
Colonial Quad dining room last
Wednesdin evening. According to
Eversley, the disruption was
caused because of deep-seeded
roots of racism, both overt and
covert, on this campus.

The committee, hopefully, will
loose racial tensions at the Univer-
sity because this incident has “po-
larized a lot of people.“ The
committee will consist of sixteen
people: 8 from the Third World
Liberation Front, 4 from Central
Council, and -i from the student
body at large.

In a bill sponsored by Dave
Neut'cld, Council appropriated
$3,000 for the Student-Faculty
Committee to Establiin a Center
for Interaction.

The purpose of the center is to
deal with crisis experienced by
any member of the University
community.

Problems such as drug addiction.
suicides, bad trips, or any pressing
problem that might. arise will be
encompassed in this center.
Psychologist-i. psychiatrists. (loc-
tors, graduate assistants and stu-
dent volunteers will be on litian
24 hours ll day, 7 days it week to
help students with any crisis. The
center‘s iiumhi-i‘ I8 -lt’i7-l‘i1l()t).
