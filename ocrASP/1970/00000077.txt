never survived the decade. while
the true jazz artists. scorned at the
time. are still being listened to
today. What is more important is
that while the Black mini was
making the only music that could
be considered American culture.
the Whites continued to think of
Blacks as primitiVe. and his music
as vile and artless.

The main problem. musically
speaking. was self evident. The
musicians trying to “purify” jazz
perceived jazz through academic
glasses. Aaron Copeland wrote.
“What interested composers...was
not so much the spirit. whatever it
symbolized. as the more technical
sides of jazz the rhythm. melody.
harmony. timbre through which
that spirit was expressed."

it seemed that the new converts
to "jazz" in the academic music
field failed to understand that jazz

ironic that the New York ’l‘iincs

M*A*S*H* A Combination
Of Slapstick And Satire

by michael iiolin & diana dalley

M.A.S.H.. which is now playing
at the Hellman Theatre. is either
the worst great picture or the best
bad picture we have ever seen. it
is concerned with a hospital unit
during the Korean War. But really
the plot is just an excuse. a devise
to tie a number of often hilarious
episodes together. M.A.S.H. is ac
tually a series of one-reel Scnnet-
type comedies which happen to
have the same characters. One of

the best episodes concerns a foot.

ball game. The players not only
smoke dope while on the bench.
but the entire game is played to
the gentle strains of the William
Tell Overture. To our mind, the
very best sequence concerns “the
best liung dentist in lhc Army,"
This stallion is one night unable to
complete the act on which his
fame rests. lie is fill ': assured that
he is a “fairy” and is going to do

commit suicide. The pains the
M.A.S.H. unit goics throuin to set
up the funeral with Nursc Dish as
an angel is cxcrucialingly funny.
And the. " but two episodes.

Nothing is sacred. not Mom nor
apple pie. its general construction
is somewhat like a weekly televi-
sion series. The two which come
to mind most vividly perhaps be-
cause they too deal with and
make a mockery of the military,
are the old Sergeant Bilko show
and McHale’s Navy. indeed.
M,A.S.i'i.'s commanding officer.
Colonel Blake. is a great deal like
Captain Binghamton.

it is almost impossible to re-
view M.A.S,H.- at least in the true
ditiontil sense. Like the Sennet
Kaystones. a discussion of tech-

'nique is absurd and a waste of
time. Let it suffice to say that
M.A.S.H. is constructed like a bad
television show. The incredible
sloppincss of the film does not
really matter. After all it is an
anti-film. even "anti-" ﬁlm.
Gould. Sutherland, and company
are hysterical. But perhaps the
greatest talent M.A.S.l‘l. has going
for it is Ring Larder. Jr. whose
first screenplay is as zany as any-
thing his old man ever wrote.
M.A,S.H. is ,..oh, hell. just see it!
The Army and the Air Force
banned it. but President Nixon's
Cabinet loved it.

The Association
Shows Basic Conﬂicts

by lielh .lo Knapkc

Man‘s two basic conflicts famile
relationship and society's relic
tionships. are scnsitivaly por-
trayed in “The Association' writ-
ten by Milledge Mosley. The pro-
duction. which featured Diane
LilFilyvirte as the nagging mother.
was organized so as to show the
powcrl‘ul influence of a woman
over both her son and husband.
and how they botli suffer heavy
conscqiiences- an inability to love.
Miss La Fayette's very natural ges-
tures and heavy ranting are so
overpowering and smothering that
her son . played by Tom Foster is
unable to develop a normal re-
lationship with people. Because he
has gone away to school. he
knows little about socializing.
Both parents, because of their sex-
ual conflicts. divide the son in
half. Mother wants him to be hers
for as long as he can. and daddy
(Jim Ford) harasscs him about hil
sexual inability only to mock him
and call him wcak when he boast!
of ll conquest.

’i‘hc conquest (Wyness Mc-
(llungl is ti thirty-three year old
attractivc female who also pro-
Vokt-s him into rage by laughing at
his luck of experiences. She inserts
a short monologue about her girl'l
death in ii fire as well as the ugly
conditions of welfare and filth
that. make her want to escape.
This short scene was an amazing
blending of a sad.-boring life of a
woman who creates a temporary
feeling of powerful manhood in
the son. This heroic ecstasy is sud-
denly cut short when the father
abuses the son iind calls him weak.

lie then leads into an explanation
of the hateful life his wife tempt-
ed him with “Just because she
wanted a baby."

The cyclc of love and hate is
confusing to man and will always
present itself. turnian will exist in
many minds. The Black Ensemble
and The Experimental ’i‘hcatre ex-
pressed this in the combination of
beautiful souan and lighting ef-
fects especially when the son is
totally outraged at his father's
laughter. The anguiin was too
great for such a sensitive boy who
wisely noted that "Everything we
do is an association."
