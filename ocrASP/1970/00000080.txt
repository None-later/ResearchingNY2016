Lacrosse And Track Teams Victorious!

LACROSSE

Wednesday the Albany State
Stickmen traveled to Castelton,
Vermont , seeking their first win
of the 1970 season and came
away with a 10-6 win over their
New England foes in a penalty
ﬁlled contest.

Mark Werder scored three times
and assisted two other goals to
lead the Danes while Steve Jak-
way and Mike Barlotta each tal-
lied twice and had one assist each.
Kevin Sheehan scored once and
helped out on two other goals,
Jeff O’Donnell had one goal and
one assist, and Tome Mullin had
one goal to finish out Albany's
scoring.

Castelton managed to keep the
game close in the first half but
Albany dominated play in the
second half and in the fourth
quarter Coach Muse opened the
gates to the inexperienced players
so as not to make a runaway of
the game.

One of the bright points of the
game was the improved play of
Albany defensemen: George Turo,
Curt Smith, Tom Ostermann, and
Barrie Kolstein.

Aggressive play by the midﬁelds
throughout the game resulted in
Albany taking sixty shots at the
Castleton goal.

Saturday, at 2 pm, the lacrosse
team hosts a tough Adelphi squad
which promises to be one of the
hardest fought contests of the
season. The game will begin at 2
pm.

weather which made early prac-
tices less than intolerable.

VAN
CLEVE

Reprinted from [/10 Albany
Times-Union.

Former Milne track star Don
Van Cleve doesn't like his name in
the newspapers, but he keeps
doing things that. put it there.

Like yesterday Van Cleve tossed
the shot a school record Alli-‘1 as
State breezed by visiting Boston
State, 911%] , in its opener,

Soph Van Cleve, without a ma-
ior but leaning toward anthro-
pology doesn’t look like a
weight man as he stands only six
feet and Weighs 185 pounds,

“Size doesn‘t mean that much,"
Van Cleve said. “1 think it. was
New Pall]. that had a guy only
about ﬁ~l'ool-2. but he out-threw
lilt‘ "

Van (‘lr-vr- llt'l‘illlll' a Weight man
llt't‘ililSt‘ of an unusual reason.

“I enjoy track Incl-is," Ill‘ said.
“and throwing lllt‘ \vvights is a lot
easier than running. 'l‘hat's a lot of
work."

“It was delightful." said State
head coach Bob MunsI-y after the
meet. “l didn‘t expect as Inany
good times as we had. The one-
‘two finish of Rodriguez and Bill
Brchm in the -l~t(l broke it open.
We'll huvrl II tougher tilne with
llartwick Saturday."

Munsey was also happy because
it. was the third outdoor meet for
lloston State, which also has an
extensive indoor program and Al-
bany does not.

"That pleased mu." Munst-y coo
tinned. “Even in [he t‘Vt‘lllS where
we didn't ban- good tum-s, wv hurl
good efforts."

Boston State was led by Carl
Jones, who tied the truck mark of
9.8 in the 100 and set II 220 mark
of 21.9, and Lou Ruggiurro, who
won the 880, mile and two-mile.

The Delhi at Hudson Valley
meet was postponed until Sutur-
day.

Needed

For Reimbursement

by Aralynn Abare

Approximately $100 has been
raised so far in a move to reim-
burse the University for the ap-
proximately $1000 damages done
to the Administration Building on
Friday, March 13.

A box has been set up at the
Campus Center Information Desk
in the hopes that students will
contribute to the fund.

The effort was initiated by II
small student-faculty group who
approached Vice President Clifton
Thorne and, "to show good
faith," guaranteed payment for
the broken windows.

“We did it," explained Don
Wilkcn, one the faculty involved,
“to help keep clear the record of
the freshman arrested,

“It was not extortion, which
many students think," be con-
tinued, “because the situation was
now primarily in the hands of the
judge and the arresting officer
involved. The administration
could only say it ‘would do every—
thing possible’ to help.
