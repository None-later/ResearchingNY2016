ABBIE HOFFMAN:

A Woo

by J. Stephen Flavin and

Replete with the heavy sounds
of improvised pagan beats synco-
pated by sporatic human wailings
of contemporary injustice, Skid-
more College sponsored Abbie
Hoffman in a Woodstock Sermon
on the Mount beneath the cele-
stial light. Abbie Hoffman be.
came prosecutor for “the people."
The establishment's Pontius
Pilate, Judge Julius Hoffman "a
Geritol freak" was verbally cruci-
fied before 3,000 jurors gathered
to pass judgement on the society
of their parents. in most courts it
is possible to obtain delays or
postponement of trial but "Judge
Hoffman said, ‘I am old, we gotta
hurryl’ Motion denied, denied,
denied, died, killed, buried!"

s“We started out to give Julie a
heart attack, we gave the court
system one too!"

Nearly 200 years ago, some
“long haired cats fought here in
Sarntogn to be free. Free means
you don't have to pay. The only
place you could be free in high
school was in the toilets. They
aren't even free anymore, 10
cents a quarter in some places
- that's capitalist progress!"

Hoffman frequently recalled
“Americans with a ‘c’ not with a
‘k' like in Washington;" historical
figures who represented the true
view of freedom. Washington,
Jefferson (who advocated revolu-
tion every 10 years), Franklin and
Lincoln are the ancestors of to-
day's revolutionaries and ironi-'
cally their pictures hung behind
Judge Hoffman throughout the
conspiracy trial. Paul Revere was
specifically referred to as repre-
sentative of the same revolu-
tionary fervor that was displayed
by Bostonians in Harvard Square
on Wednesday.

“ 0n the eighteenth of April in
"75...". Paul Revere, standing on
the blinks of the Charles, looked
across at the "biggest strobe light"
coming from North Church. At
the signal he jumped on his
motorcycle and rode through the
streets yelling “The pigs are
coming, the pigs are coming!’

Freedom as a real value is best
understood by the young revolu-
tionaries each working to over-
throw the repressive yoke of
capitalism.

Do you know why there's a
shortage of grass? “There's a man
in the injustice Department-Herr
Kleindienst, He says you‘re all
ideological criminals. He sends
planes to make war on a plant."
Shouldn't the grass grow free? if
they make pot legal in Canada,
‘thcre'll be an interesting
border war."

“Woodstock, they said it

couldn't be done. After it was
done Rockefeller declared it a
disaster area. We hope it was-"a
... ter for you!"
This system and its creator, the
Protestant Work Ethic “ has to go
down the drain. Work is a dirty
word. We will build a system
where we integrate work and play.
When this system is ripped down
we'll put Heaven in its place.
There'll be food for all." We'll eat
the pigs!

"Violence has to he redefined.
Lyndon Johnson got on National
Boob Tube after Dr. Martin
Luther King was assassinated and
said in memory of his name we
must be non-violent. Holy shit!
Lyndon Johnson is a pacifist. We
can have sit-ins in the Mekong
Delta and sing ‘We Shall Over-
come' in Chicago!"

  

"We're outlaws in the eyes of
America" he asserted. "You're an
outlaw-~ act like it!" American
youth knows how to break the
system. “We're their kids!"

“ Love it or leave it they say. We
left it!“ American politics must be
fought out in the streets, not the
courts not the voting booth.

Even though the ‘ﬂower child-
ren' believe in love, there is a need
for a redefinition of violence.
"Capitalism is violent." The sys-
tem is based on violence. “Any-
thing done to destroy that system
is done in love."

“To love we have to survive. To
survive we have to fight."

“The streets are tllc only court
we have left in this country."
Justice must be redefined, as vio-
lence must be. “The law and
courts ain't got a fuckin‘ thing to
do with justice."

This was a nation born and
baptized in revolution. “This
nation is responsible for war and
pollution. They want to give us
haircuts. Unless we stick together
we'll have our hair cut together.
Barbershop poles are red, white,
and blue-why? Think about it!"

‘ They can call us anything, any-
thing as long as we know we are
young we are proud, and we stick
together "

after a picnic, or when you
bring home a couple of cold
6-paks and forget to put ’em
in the refrigerator. Does re-
chilling goof up the taste or
ﬂatten the flavor?

Relax. You don’t have
to worry.

A really
good beer like
Budweiser is just
as good when you chill it
twice. We’re mighty glad about
that. We’d hate to think of all
our effort going down the drain

Does it hurt

  

Yes?

to chill beer twice?

Not that you’d want to. Some-
times it just happens. . . like

just because the temperature
has its ups and downs.

You can understand why
when you consider all the extra
trouble and extra expense that
go into brewing Budo. For in-
stance, Budweiser is the only
beer in America that’s Beech-
wood Aged.

So. . . it’s absolutely okay

to chill beer twice.

Enough said. (Of
No9

. course, we have
a lot more to say

about Budweiser. But we’ll
keep it on ice for now.)

Budweiser. is the KiniLof Beers.

(But you know that.)

Accepts CURE Plan 

by Bob Warner

The University Senate over-
whelmingly passed the CURE pro-
posal last Monday, which elimin-
ates all undergraduate require-
mean except for the major and
minor requirements and physical
education.

The Senate stated that CURE
would “herald the beginning of
new educational patterns at this
univvrsity." The concept of the
“well-rounded man" was rejected,
as well. Scnalc‘s feeling was that it
is both morally wrong and waste-
ful to rcqllil'l' sludcnls lo take
courses that they have no intercsl
in, and canllol be forced to take
an interest in, despilc efforts by
professors to whip sludcnls with
the grade.

Other arguments supporting
CURE were that most required
courses “glorify memories", intro-
ductory courses are a waste, pro-
fessors could be free(' from the
loWer level courses to teach more
desirable classes, and that most. of
the required courses are irrelevant
to the students' life. The most
cogent argument in favor of
CURE was that this does not
prohibit anyone from taking the
required courses, but merely gives
those wllo do not wish to follow a
restrictive educational plan the
freedom to do so.

The minority of Senators who
opposed CURE felt that students
need a disciplined education, an
education that is designed to dis-
ciplinc the student's mind, and
thnl the information gathered
from the required courses is really
secondary.

Dcun Pcrlmuttcr attempted to
moderate the CURE proposal;
however, he flliled to do so. llis
ammendmcnt would have re»
quired the student to take 39 of
his free elective credits outside the
fields of his major or minor. His
rationale was lhal students might
take all or nearly all of their
credits in their specialization,
which he felt was antithetical to
CURE.

'l‘llc CURE proposal did finally
pass intact al'lcr seven monllls of
work by [he committee of six
students: Sieve Villano, Steve
Bookin, Vernon Bryanl, Phil Can-
lor, Sue Elbcrgcr, and Aline Lep-
kin.

The following courses are not
required under the CURE pro-
posnl:

1. English composition— 3 cre-
dits

2. Art, literature, music, philo-
sophy— 9 credits
3. Foreign language— (3 credits
‘1. Social Sciences— 12 credits
5. Math and science— 12 credits
The CURE proposal applies to
all undergraduates, including
graduating seniors, but will not
afl'ccl professional programs or
departmental majors. (Teacher
education requirements are still
22 credits.)

Physical Education is required,
but the amount (one year or two)
is to be decided each year accord
ing to state law.

Before Thursday afternoon's
Senate meeting. however, rumors
had been spreading all over cam-
pus tllut the Board of Trustees

   
 

Senate

rejected CURE. This does not
have any validity, though. CURE
is presently on President
Kuusisto‘s desk awaiting expected
approval. It must also be formally
registered at the State Education
Department. This procedure is a
mere formality, however; rumors
spread by signs outside the Cam-
pus Center are unfounded, there-
fore.

To check out lllc rumors, irate
and confused studcnts numbering
over 50 gathered al the Senate
mccling in the Ballroom yesterday
afternoon. Slcvc Villano, who in-
troduced the CURE bill, emphati-
cally denied the rumors. He said
lhal [he Board of Trustees will
nol judgc CURE either way, and
that the Senate has been the final
authority on tile proposal. Dr.
Finklestein, thc Vice-Chairman of
the Senate, said that the Boom in
Trustees and the University Coun-
cil do not concern themselves
with school curriculum. He rc-
fcrrcd to the case of Buffalo,
which liberalized its requirements
two years ago with no objections
from the SUNY-Buffalo Board of
Trustees or University Council.

(The Senate lieVer formally coli-
vcned on Thursday because there
wasn't a quorum.)

Results of the CURE poll were
released: 1911 voting in favor,
1 19 against and 8 abstaining.

Other business at Monday's Sen-
ate meeting was the introduction
of a resolution which would pro-
hibit Senate from taking political
stands. The resolution, which was
introduced by Regis Deuel, called
for the limitation of “the Senate's
jurisdiction and its agenda to mat-
ters pertaining to the governance
of this university." The resolution
