Loving-W

by Tom Quigley

LOVING is an uncompromising
ﬁlm about compromise in mar-
riage and career. It catalogs a few
hours in the life of a commercial
artist trapped in the doldrums of
an uninspired career and a medio-
cre. middle class marriage.

George Segal plays Brooks Wil-
son. whose talent has been squan-
dered by the insipid, exploitative
demands of those who “invest” in
him and who. because of the
rampant egotism of» his immature
nature, is unable to bring himself
under control.

When the bacon and eggs banali-
ty of suburban homelife begins to
smother him, Brooks invades the
city for another bout with the
bottle and a retreat to the arms of
his mistress. Wilson’s battle to
come to terms with the constant
infantile impulses to escape
through drunkenness and batten
ing ram sexuality, is essentially
the story of every socially be-
sieged artist.

The frustration of immediate
necessity that prevents many art-

.lazz And Racial Prejudice In
America - Now And Then

by Robert Rosenblum

There are many who feel that
because jazz is not heard on radio
or TV it is not capable of interest-
ing a large audience. Actually the
death of attainable jazz is a result
of historical prejudice and virtual
censorship.

When the record industry began
to develop. Black artists were only
recorded on so-called “race re-
cords". which. though prominent
in Black ghettoes. were not played
on radio or distributed in white
areas.

What did come out of the radio
and in records by the millions was
commercial jazz. Americans
thought this. watered down. cras-
sly commercial "music" jazz while
the authentic music was rarely
heard. Occasionally. however. jazz
seeped through the air waves.
Then came the censors.

Will Hays was appointed head of

the motion picture producers and
distributors. As Neil Leonard says
in his book Jazz and the White
American. "Hays set a moral tone
which helped keep real jazz out of
films.“

The radio stations were forced
to keep jazz off the air as a result
of the 1927 Radio Act. This law
meant that if “objectionable” mu-
sic was broadcast then the station
might not have its license re-
newed. The Radio Music Com-
pany proclaimed when it first
came into being. "The new firm
will have its influence in putting
jazz in the background of the
American musical picture.“

When the hop era came in
the Middle Forties the reaction
was less because jazz was less
popular. and thus less of a threat.
However. there definitely were
reactions. Time magazine came
out with articles ncusing the bop-

 

raal the Mini;
the tint the llulla

And we've got the Pilaf. and
Beef Kebob. And Persian
Snow. The real thing. Our cook
was the shiek of chiefs when he
was sowing his wild Kibbec
back in Baghdad. Now he's
only a short camel‘s drive from
the campus on Central
Avenue-just past Route 155.
Look for the big Kabob sign
that says “Salim’s”. We're a
different Abu Tabul
(drummer). Real different.
Come and help ﬁll a needy

pers of using obscene lyrics.
Ironically. bop singers usually
used only scat (nonsense) syl‘
lables. Time. with its grand
pechant for inacuracy. wrote a
later article on modern jazz with-
out once mentioning its most pre-

dominant character—r Charlie
Parker. Several radio stations
actually banned bop. (Note:

“bop” is really nothing more than
an extended use of chord
changes.)

It is true that all this is past. but
many remnants remain. in the late
50‘s and 60‘s a series of riots at
jazz festivals were called “com-
munist inspired“ and according to
John Wilson in his book. Jazz, [/10
’I‘runsiiion Years. even festival
riots that had nothing to do with
jazz were called jazz riots.

Perhaps the most incitel‘ul book
concerning society's unfairness to
the art form of jazz is The Jazz
Life by Nat Hentoff. in his book
he informs the reader that the
ﬁrst jazz critics. books. record
collectors, festivals. periodicals.
and general recognition of jazz as
an art form came in Europe.

ists of all media from attaining
their aspired greatness is the es-
sence of Brooks' dissatisfaction.
His romantic nature collides with
the vagaries of human existence in
everyday life. When mundane res-
ponsibilities cause him to face the
realities of providing for his fami-
ly. he runs to his sexual and
alcoholic pacifiers for compensa-
tion.

His self-centeredness is not the
only reason for his tragedy. The
insensitive, non-asthetic world of
commercialism is just as re-
sponsible for destroying the po-
tential of every artist.

This makes Brooks one of the
most paradoxical and disconcert-
ing characters in recent film his-
tory. The greatest surprise of all is
that George Segal succeeds brilu
liantly in the role while the film as
a whole is dissatisfying.

Segal has been playing this
pseudo, pretty boy syndrom type
since his debut in films. This time.
however, he brings embittering'
insight to the role of a man who
has fallen short of greatness while
rejecting his humanness. Segal's
face reflects the haggard. hollow
eyed facade of five o'clock sha-
dow that shows the weariness of a

man confused and pursued.

 

Eva Marie Saint plays Segal's
patient and plain housefrau. She
adds presence to the part but her

talent is generally wasted as is
much of the cast. The problem
rests in Don Devlin’s soap-operatic
script. Devlin keeps the sentiment
at a low-sudsing level but concen-
trates so much upon Segal‘s
character that the many minor
roles are depthless caricatures
loitering around a disjointed cen-
tral theme.

The improvised quality of dia-
logue and motion throughout the
film is its greatest asset. Director
Irvin Kershner must be credited
with the informal development of
situations and scenes. This gives
the film a casual sense of reality
while we merely observe the pro-
ceedings.

Kershncr and Devlin must bear
the brunt of criticism in that they
both seem to have lost the actual
viewpoint of the film. The movie
tells us more about the artist. and
his relationship with society than
it does about loving. For all the
marvelous bits of visual and con-
textual satire I.()VING becomes a
dismal echo of VIRGINIA
WOOLF which said more about
love and human relationship than
this little film is able to produce.

It is difficult to praise the most
beautiful production of a child’s
play eVer done by a college group.
The American Premiere of
Ala-ed-Din (the Caliph. and the
Dreadful Magician) presented last
week provided a glorious two
hours which appealed to the
aesthetic sense of adults as well as
to the adventurous whims of
children. Dr. Pettit wrote the lyri-
cal script which was brilliantly
enhanced by the artistry of the
director Patricia B. Snyder. and
by the set designs depicting the
possessions and antiques of the
Middle East.

The young boy who possesses
the magic lamp and who is pur-
sued by the Dreadful Magician isa
simple plot which was accom—
panied by the wonderful mime
ability and the sensual dancing of
the mysterious beauties of the
East. The Magician (Timothy
Brennan) not only had a powerful
and articulate manner of evoking
fear (from the children that is)
but suited “the action to the
word." His gestures. like those of
the Caliph (Peter Hasher) were

emphasize that role.

'I‘o focus on the aesthetic
aspects highlights the brilliantly
colored and sensitively textured
materials which reflected the
splendor and wealth. Arlene
DuMond exhibited her talents for
costume designing because of the
dancer's ability to move freely in
the complicated outfits. The Mid-
eastern music accompanied this
very glamorous group of slave
dancers who were well instructed
by choreographers Adrienne
Spagnola and Kathleen O'Neil.
Their grace and charm added to
the simple melodies very often
played by solo oboes or flutes. To
judge the quality of the perfor-
mers sets and lighting is difficult
because perfection is often unsur-
passed.
