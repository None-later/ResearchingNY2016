Congressman Richard Ottinger.
contender for the Democratic
Senatorial nomination spoke to
over 500 Environmentalists in the
Ballroom Wednesday afternoon.

Ottinger. a Westchester Demo-
crat. consistently criticized the
Nixon Administration's efforts (or
lack of them) on behalf of en-
vironment conservation, human
welfare. and the stopping of the
war in Vietnam.

The Congressman's short speech
was dedicated to ecoloev but he
underscored the urgency of im‘
mediately ending the war in Viet~
nam because conservation pro-
grams cannot be funded until all
the troops are withdrawn.

"If anyone is going to clean up
the environment. it will be you
(the students),” stated the Con-
gressman at the beginning of his
speech. He warned the miiny a-
political conservationists that
when people such as Nixon and
Reagan get on the environment
bandwagon “the environment is in
trouble."

He suggested that a land he
created among citizen environ-
mental groups in order that in-
dustrial violiiters may be brought.
to court. Such a l'und is needed
because our society cannot func-
tion without money; and the pro-
secution costs of hiring lawyers
are loo great to be borne by a
single individual.

Cnvironmental clean-up. ac-
cording to Ottinger, should not be
limited to water and air polliilioii.
but should be broadened to Ill'
elude slums in which children can
easily become lead-poisoned :niil
rat-bitten. Again. he put the
blame on the Vietnam war. which
is channeling funds for destructive
activities. instead ol~ constructive
endeavors.

He continued to advise the l’Yl‘I
enthusiasts that they must not
limit their protests lo |)tllllllltltl.
but must expand their energies
with equal vigor to (lialleiigi- the
war and poverty as lllt'll‘ pet
issues.

Questions I’roni the illlllit'lll‘c
were taken. and one student asked
for Ottinger's stand on the
Panther 2| trial. He replied that
he supports their civil rights in the
trial. but he does not condone the
Violence that they have been ac-
cused of.

Following the Attorney Gen-
eral‘s speech a panel discussion
basically concerned with local en-
vironmental problems ensued.
Questions were directed to the
panel consisting of Mayor Coming
of Albany; Jack Lauber, from the
NYS Health Department; Frank
McGowan, a chemist for Tobin
Packing Co.; and Walter Barrett.
attorney for the Niagara Mohawk
Power Co. The group’s moderator
was Dwight Metzler. Deputy Com-
missioner of the NYS Department
of Health.

A group of concerned students
badgcred Mayor Corning with
questions about the condition of
Albany streets. A PYE repre.
sentativc presented a complaint
received from a woman in Albany
who said "the streets of Albany
are not fit for children." Corning
countered that the complaint. if
lodged with him. Would be ex-
plored.

Coming. in answering ii question
concerning the Tobin Packing
Company. placed 2/3 of the
blame on Coloiiie as 2/3 of the
water affected is in this area. He
did say that the company is in the
process of building a sewage sys-
tem that would deal with the
wastes and he feels “they are
doing a good job in treating this
pollution,"

The mayor expressed a personal
cominittmeiil to environmental
ret'orin. aiiil pointed out that he
was one of the first to endorse
liockel‘eller's pure water program
and will continue to support re-
forms in the future.

Jack l4illll)(‘t'. the Regional Air
Pollution (‘ontrol Engineer of the
Department of lleallh. stressed
the importance of these reforms
in a brief presentation. He stated
tlial “In the US we have 200
million people. but our environ
mental pollution represents .1
population of about '

The way to curb this is through
legislation controlling pollution of
our natural resources But as one
Iiiin school girl said. while point-
ing to a student with a cigarette
dangling from his mouth. “You're
accusing the government of caiis
iiig our environmental dilemma
and yelling t'or legislativereform.
Yet how 'an the problem be
soIVed at ii national level if you
don‘t helping as an indi-
vidnal'.‘“
