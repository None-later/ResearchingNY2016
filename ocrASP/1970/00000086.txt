THE ASP SPORT

 

NCAA Bound
Netmen

 

by Ted Rosenberg

The Albany State Varsity Tennis
team has now won 13 consecutive
matches including three this year.

The Danes began the season by
handily defeating Central Con-
necticut 7-2. Dave HawIey played
number one singles with Junior

en Fishman playing number
two. Ted Rosenberg was in the
third spot with Freshmen Harold
Forest and Eric Carlson 4th and
5th respectively. All won their
matches.

Stretch Unbeaten String to Thirteen

ley, in a very close match. Thus,
he earned the right to play no. 1
versus Plattsburgh and Potsdam.

Also, the no. 6 and 7 men

switched positions, giving State
surprisingly three excellent fresh-

men in their starting line-up. Chris
Burke was the man who made the

jump into the starting line-up for

the ﬁrst time. He responded with
two impressive victories.

The tough doubles combinations
versus Potsdam were Hawley and

Burke undefeated in two. Ken
Fishman suffered his only defeat
of the season versus Rich Johns of
Potsdam in a close match. Albany
(3-0) with victories over Central
Connecticut by 7-2, Plattsburgh
9-0 and Potsdam 8-1, is slowly
reaching the midseason form it
needs for its next three en-
counters versus R.P.X., Hartwick,
and Oneonta, which are the
toughest in the Danes’ schedule.

Yesterday's varsity and junior
varsity tennis matches against
Oneonta were rained out.
