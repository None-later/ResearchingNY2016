History of History

by Bob Wanier

According to five members of
the History Department faculty.
the department has not improued
or changed since Dialogue last
March. The undergraduates have
not mustered enough support for
their demand for 50-50 repre-
sentation on the hiringand tenure
committees. nor is it clear (hot
this is whal they desire.

The gradualc nssislants that Dr.
Krosby, Chairman of the Depart-
ment had been «airing the Ad-
ministration fnr were finally
grained. This came about because
Krosby Ihrcalcned to limit liislnry
iegislralion in each class [0 25
(the faculty voted on it.) How-
ever. sludcnls were not happy
with [his plan.

In greater delail, (his is who!
Joe Mada, Graduate A "islnnl, Dr.
Ivan Slacn. Dr. Krosby, Dr. War-
ren Roberts, and Mr. Norm Lcuy
lhoughl of the preach! stale oflhc
History Department:

Joe Meda does not want 50—50
representation on departmental
committees but for entirer dif-
ferent reasons than some his other
colleagues He believes that if stu-
dents vote on committees, they
legitimize the decisions made by
the department. In other words,
the faculty could always use as a
shield against criticism that stu-
dents had a part in the decisions,
therefore everything is fair and
justified becausc of this so-called
democratic proccss. Another
problem is that many of the com-
mittees are not of much interest
to students right now.

In general, Meda does not see
any change in the history depart-
ment, but does see internal de-
partmental politicking. There are
twu factions, one consisting of the
more conservative professors, and
the other of the more “progres-
sive" faculty. Medn goes on to say
that the faculty cannot work with
each other until they rid them-
selves of their notion that they are
selfcmployed, because they are in
actuality, members of a depart
ment of a university, Finally, he
believes that most of the faculty
have “no confidence in student's
abilities and no confidence in
their own.”

Dr. Ivan Stccn thought it was
too curly, ycl, to sot- any imprch-
mcnls in the department but he is
wniiing ungerIy for thc student
committee report on curriculum.
He believes this is the urea in
which students can l)L mosl hpr-
ful sincc they are directly lllVOlVL'fl
with the curriculum.

According lo Slot-n, when the
dcparlmcnl voted to liinil registra-
lion lo 25 pcr class, it was "confi-
dcul" that thc Administration
\vould givc tho money Ilt‘('(lt'(l for

 » *«u newer-m

His line of argument was that a
student is responsible to no one
else, but himself, whereas the
faculty must support their fami-
lies. He felt, then, that students
were more expendable than
faculty, because students could go
from university to university, year
after year while the faculty, if
they struck, would be out ofjobs.
The ASP reporter suggested that
students might have trouble in
applying for admission to grad-
uate schools or jobs if they have
been suspended or expelled from
the university. Krosby, however,
did not think that this had much
validity.

The History Department is now
allowing all students who want to
register to do so. Krosby hopes
that by overcrowding classes,
greater pressure will be brought to
bear upon the Administration to
give more funds for more quali-
l'icd professors.

Dr. Warren Roberts, a
most diligent worker believes the
department and the university
have become worse over the past
year, He maintains that students
are less willing to do work, and
attend classes than ever before.

Roberts is appalled by the idea
of 50.50 representation because
he does not want students to ruin
their education by wasting pre-
cious time on endless committees.
For that matter, he does not want
the faculty to waste their valuable
time in university or “pigmy”
politics, and is not bothered by
the idea that no one then would
serve on committees.

He believes the purpose of a
university is to provide students
with the books and facilities so
that they may “read books and
write papers." He is calling for
traditional and formal education;
he then calls for an oligarchicnl
administering of the university, so
professors can research and stu-
dents can learn without thc inter-
ference of campus politics.

Norm Levy of the History Dc-
partmcnt does not believe the
department has changed since the
Dialogue. He doesn't bclicvo that
50—50 is going to save the depart-
mcnt, but rather it will be good
prol‘cssors that will improve the
department. “We don't havc them
now," chy maintains. I'lc believes
that Krosby was wrong to use
students to get his demands, and
would not go so far as to limit
registration to lcn, five, or cvon
zero, bccausc he did not have the
support of his faculty or the will
to do l0 hlmeelf.

Kuusisto at Conference
Discusses Recent Events

After a two week absence, Act-
ing President Allen Kuusisto
opened his weekly press con-
ference with students with several
important announcements, many
of them answers to previously
asked questions.

The administration has been
meeting with a steering committee
of black students and staff mem-
bers in efforts to avoid further
disorders like that which occurcd
on Colonial Quad. The black stu-
dent arrcstcd last week in con-
junction with thc Colonial Quad
incident has had the date for his
jury trial set. Three complaints--
two University and one indivi~
dual“ have been filed against him.
President Kuusisto mentioned the
possibility of transfcring the case
from civil to campus judiciary
Court; however, this was deemed
unlikely.

The SUNY Board of Trustees
has announced an amendment to
their Rules and Regulations Gov-
erning Campus Order. Each cinn-
pus is to sci tip ll hearing commits
too of ii administrators, 3 faculty
and 3 students (appointed by the
rest of the committee) to rcvicw
cases

effect immediately, and there is a
chance that formerly required
courses with low enrollment will
be cancelled to allow those teach-
ers involved to open new sections
in upper level courses ncxt semes-
tcr.

The Economic Opportunity
Program was also discussed. Con-
trary to rumor, EOP has not been
financially cut. Its allocation in
the '70-‘71 budget has been re-
duced from that requested, but
the sum allotcd is approximately
the same as this year, $900,000.

Jack Schwartz questioned the
racist practices in the Bursar‘s
Ofﬁce in which money is withheld
from black sutdcnts for the pur-
pose of paying bills. This practice
is in conflict with the official
procedures of allocating funds for
the use of EOP students (and
letting them pay their own bills).
Schwartz stated that this behavior
on the past of the Bursar’s Office
is directly aimed at black stu-

dents.

The overall plans for the de-
velopment of Albany into a grad-
uatc center were sharply criticized
by one student who stated the
policy of accepting primarily up-
perclassmen transfers lessens the
opportunity for poorer individuals
to attend this university.

Environmental problems also
were questioned. Open fires on
Indian Quad were noted as being
illegal and dangerous polluters.
Colonel Walter Tisdalc,Assistant
to the President for Management
and Planning informed the audi-
ence that a permit had been ob-
tained by the construction firms
and that ways of recycling this
waste were severely limited.

The banning of non-returnable
cans was demanded by Ed Shaw,
who felt that the University’s re-
quest for bottled soda in return-
able containers would greatly aid
thc preservation of the environ-
ment by avoiding waste.

the Patriot party are rcvotutionary
organizations working in poor
communities, the Panther Party in
black communities, the Patriot
Party in white communities. They
are both working for the freedom
of their people and all poor and
working people in the United
Stalcs. They have been responsi-
hlc for such programs as free
breakfast programs, l'rcc clothing
programs free medical clinics, lib
oration schools community cen-
ters. and free food programs.

Evcr since the Panther Party
was formed 3 years ago, the USA
govurnmcnt has tried to destroy
them. The governments latest tuc-
lie is “busting” Panthers on
lrumpcd up conspiracy charges.
'I‘wo examples are the Panther 21
case and the trial of Bobby Scale
in New I'Iuven for alleged murder.
Afcni Sl‘lilklll', one of the Panther
2|, will speak about these two
trials and what they mean to the
people of [his country.

The Patriot Party was formed
in Hcplcmbcr 1069. Their main
emphasis is in the South. “One of
our main purposes is to unify our
brothers and sistcrs in the South
with our brothers and sisters in
the North." They will speak about
lhat and the busts they have
already had in 7 months of cxist~
encu., ic, how the government is
trying to destroy the Patriot Party
before it reaches out to the poor
white people in the South.
