the use of police on campuseaf'to deal with student

the circumstances."

SUNYA students should take note that their
friendly neighborhood Legislators are not too well
disposed to student protest, especially violence. The '
Republicans unanimously did not rule out the
possibility of using police to interfere with campus
strikes.

The last question asked of the Legislators seemed
newlto many of them. “Do you favor the bill now
pending in the legislature that would prohibit
mandatory Student Activity Assessment (tax)?"
19% were in favor. 20% opposed, and 61% because
of ignorance of the bill or because they were unsure
of their position, had no answer.

The meaning of the results here are unclear. but
it seems to be more favored among the Republicans
than the Democrats.

The remaining point to be explored is whether
monor party endorsement (liberal or conservative)
indicates that the Legislator is more to one extreme
of the political spectrum. than his colleagues who
only have major party affiliation. Three issues will
be used as samples: the lowering of the voting age to
18. the war, and welfare.

It seems then, that Liberal Party endorsements of
Democrats does not necessarily mean that the
Legislator is any more liberal than his Democratic
colleagues, who do not have Liberal Party support.
It seems then, that the Liberal Party is no more
Liberal than the Democratic Party.

Conservative Party endorsement for Republicans,
however, does seem to indicate that the Republican
is more to the right than his Republican colleague
who lacks conservative party support.

Ex-GI' I Interview

Continued from page 1

I had always been trying to get
a 30-day leave and soon after I got
out I got word that my kid sister
was dying. She was only 14 when I
joined and I hadn't seen her for
almost 3 years. So I ﬁnally got an
emergency pass. I came back to
the States. That’s when she died.

1 was sick-I was so sick about

Withdrawal Wiihdm‘i’ﬂll’d‘sl the army-I felt rotten about

everything. i was fucked-up. The
only thing that would stand out in

32% my mind while I was home was
23% the stockade--and with the death

and all I just couldn’t go back. I
would rather take a Dishonorsble
with FUCK written across the
middle of it--I just wanted out. I
was so screwed up and Istill only
had 5 months left. You just can't.
describe how you feel.

So what did you do?

Well--I went to Fort Hamilton
where I was stationed now. They
tried to play it cool. You see
having been in 3 years they didn’t
want to say I was unfit. Besides-J

ck--

you see they want to salvage as
many as possible. They thought
that if I stayed in the U.S. I’d
have no problems.

I talked with the commander at
Hamilton. He said they’d review
my case the next month-~00 just
stay around and he’d treat me all
right. He played real sympathetic
and everything. Then, when I
checked the list -I had KP.

I got so pissed! so pissed! I
walked over to headquarters I
went in-I said to him, “You can
let me go on a 208 or i’m going
myself. I'm going. You can shove
this army right up your ass."

I walked out--and kept on
walking.

Nearly a month later Terry
Rinault received his “208” -- a
Dishonorable Discharge. He had
joined the army April 22,1963.
He walked out October 15, 1965.
Rinault substantiated his story by
showing this writer his court-
martial papers. Four statements.
Four favorable.

Today Rinault is working two
jobs--one as an antenna installer
and another with the Income Tax
Department of New York State.
He loves to paint--when this cam-
pus was being built, he was on the
painting crew. He has one son.

When his younger brother
John, announced he was joining
the Marines Rinault took him in a
room and beat the shit out of

him.

Panther
Speaks at

by .I . Stephen Flavin

“I’m not a Panther; I can't
speak for the Panthers, but the
Pantheril story in court is blown
out as proportion." The words of
Gerald Lefcourt attorney for the
defense of 21 Black Panthers
charged with "plotting to make
New York City department stores
'bum. baby, burn’ fell upon
semi-attentive ears in Skidmore's
College Hall. The paradox of Skid-
more youth assembled in an an-
tique church to hear the story of
"their contemporaries’ " struggle
to be free in an oppressive state
was reminiscent of the apathetic
farmers of our colonial era who
didn’t join the revolution until
Gentleman Johnny had to be
stopped on their doorsteps in
Saratoga.

‘The Federal Government is
trying to move the country to tile
right. The branches of government
are the true conspirators. The
Executive branch follows a policy
of oppression and ‘maintaining
status quo.‘ The Legislative appro-
priates funds for these Executive
policies and passes few bills for
civil rights. The courts are politi-

Stolen Art
On

Campus

In the past two weeks, ten
different pieces of art work have
been taken from University build-
ings These include two from
Colonial Quad, five from Dutch
Quad and three from the Aca-
demic Podium. These works repre-
sent original pieces that have been
placed on campus during the last
three years by the Art Co-
Ordination Committee.

The art pieces were done by
New York State artists and in-

clude oils, water colors. collages,
seriograplls. and ceramics. Several
pieces done by University artists
are also in the collection. The
pieces missing include: four serio-
gruphs by Jack Bhsson. one Tom
O‘Connor original print. one oil
by Ethel Mngafan, two William
Clark construction picccs, one oil
by Victor Liguori, one water color
by Henry Kidder from the Ford-
Timcs art collection, and a large
number of mounted and framed
posters.

Tile Art Committee, headed by
Mrs. Lois Gregg, includes both
faculty and students. This group
has been responsible for placing
approximately 300 llrt pieces
throughout the campus.

The Art Committee will be
meeting soon to make decisions as
to what steps need to be tllkcn to
safeguard the remaining pieces. it
may become necessary to remove
the works from some of the build-
ings. Tile entire University com-
munity is being asked at this time
to become especially aware of
their individual responsibility.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS-

Skidmore Colle e

cal tools " Lefcourt contends that.
under such a system, there can be

no checks and balances, no repre-
sentatlve government, no demo-

cracy!

The Panthers according to
Lefcourt,”advocate the over-
throw of the present system by
any means possible and instituting
socialist programs which advocate
the needs of the black ghettos. A
majority of young Blacks supports
the Panthers. A majority, if not
80%, of the Blacks feels the gov-
ernment is trying to wipe them
out. The government can deal
with Black uprisings in the ghettos
simply be sealing them off. But
the govornment can‘t deal with a
Black—White coalition and fears
this."

‘The government, white su-
premacists, and racist have little
to fear however, if the thinking of
sheltered, well-to-do whites re-
mains unchallenged."

One coed questioned Lef-
court’s definition of coalition. be-
lieving that “under this coalition.
does that mean the Blacks join us
and we tell them what to do and
they have to do it?" Such naive
thinking results in alienation and
bloodbaths, not brotherhood and
lasting harmonic relations! Under
that "coalition" we would ilave
20th century slavery, “White
Man's Burden.”

‘Every white is a racist. If he
doesn‘t admit it. he is a fool. It is
just like every male is a male
chauvinist~ it is ingrained in us
from birth by our society." Lef
court felt he “had to put forth the
case of the Panthers. It is a test
for white people.”

Some members of the “ma-
jority” care enough to support the
oppressed the best way they can.
Lefcourt and other professional
men have formed “Communes”
—' collectives consisting of male
and female personnel in which
everybody is treated on a totally
equal basis. The “Communes” are

 

political organizatlu s. seeking
first change in this country and
second the work of their re-
spective fields, e.g. law, medicine,
etc. Lefcourt’s Law Commune is
available to those arrested for any
crime having bearing on social or
political charges. Besides the cases
pending on, the Panther 21, the
"Commune" is handling as many
cases of welfare recipients as pos-
sible. The overload is handled by
the National Lawyer‘s Guild. All
of the members of Lefcourt's Le-
gal Commune are on the board of
the National Lawyer’s Guild.

The results of early successes of
the “Legal Commune" were coun-
tered by “being burned out. But
we’re coming back bigger and
stronger. Young law students
coming out fresh want this kind
of work." Lefcourt and associates
have taken refuge in the same

building that offices William
Kunstler

Many newspaper editorials
call for the disbarment of

Kunstler. But Kunstler has 0| long
and impressive list of credentials;
he may not be disbarred, but
other younter liberal lawyers
without reputations may be."

The word revolution reached
Skidmore. Some students were in
favor of “striking classes in sup-
port of Yale's strike and in sup-
port of Black Panthers on trial."
Discussion followed on whether
or not to ask the administration if
the students could have permis-
sion to strike and if the adminis-
tration would pay for buses to
Connecticut on May 1,2, and 3
for demonstrations at Yale for the
Black Panthers. The transient
strike dialogue was summarized
by one coed as,“At Yale they
have strikes. At Skidmore, they
have teas " Another fair lass ex-
claimed,“Too many Skidmore
girls are of afraid of hurting their
own little ol' rear ends— ask the
administration for permission to
have a strike— ludicrous." The

  

ASP is awaiting word on the fate
of Skidmore's “potentially vola-
tile situation."

What's in a name? A remark
overheard after Gerald Lefcourt's
lecture summarizes “His last name
tells us his political affiliation and
occupation-~Leftcourt."

WE ARE SORRY!

Since the start of the semester our delivery vehicles
have been robbed six times. Three of these incidents in
the last two weeks. Due to this recent rash of robberies
we are placed in the position of charging a delivery charge
for all orders to the uptown campus. We apologize to our
many loyal customers for this action, but we can no
longer absorb the cost of repails to our vehicles and loss
or merchanidise.

it is a shame that so many good students have to be
penalized for the actions of a sick minority but we feel
we have gone as far as we can.
