Rock Of

Ages - A

Beatle Retrospective

by Allyne Jacob

In the spring of 1967, the
popular music world was taken
aback by the appearance ofa new
type of music, The Beatles, having
nearly always been in the van-
guard of contemporary music, had
once more taken an avant gardist
position. Sargent Peppers Lonely
Hearts Club Band was a potpourri
of firsts or near firsts as far as the
‘ commercial" music was concern-
ed. Some brief background ma-
terial to begin.

The album was to take the
longest period to conceive and
produce; it took at least seven
months of effort. The group was,
as could be seen by the nature of
their prior two albums. embarking
on an introspective journey. Rub-
ber Soul and Revolver. with songs
such as Tomorrow Never Knows
and l Wunl to Tell You, sol. Ihe
stage for the then denouement.
Sgt. Peppers combines the Beatles'
interest with drugs and with the
search for meaning and substance
in a world which seemed to hch a
dearth of both. Perhaps by on-
deavoring to look within they were
hoping to find tranquility. This
album in part at least is a music
diary of their LmVels.

We are witnessing in funeral and
birth (reincarnation?) at one
and the same time. The old
Beatles are symbolized by their
wax impression(from their
“yeah-yeah" period) which
appeared in the famous wax
museum in London, Murlnmc
'I‘ussuuds. The era of nziivctc is
over and with it the image of
school boy innocence. The “new”
Beatles are more “mature” and
willing to explore virgin territory.
thuL is. areas which they have not
delved into previously. The “new”
Beatles are shown next to their
old selves. The audience which
they have invited to the funeral
is intriguingThc people thcrc rc-
pruscnl. either those who have
dealt wiLh drugs in one form or
other and/or people who have
hurl myths built umund Lhcm,who
for whatever reasons have stood
out in their field. Wc sec Sonny
Liston, a former hcnvy weighl
boxer, Wilifrcd Hyde-White, a

British actor _ an early picture
of Arturo Toscanni. the eminent
symphony conductor. W.C.
Fields, the misanthrope of the
screen, Mae West, the sex-symbol
of the 1920‘s and 30's, Marlon
Brando, wearing his motorcycle
hat that he wore in the picture
about youth lost and out for
vindictive-rebellious "kicks," Wild
One, Johnny Weismuller the Tar-
zan of the thirties (could he be
the id in us?) Dylan Thomas
the enigmatic poet, who wrote
often about the nature oflife and
death, William Cody, the model of
the cowboy of the 19th century,
Fred Astaire, the dnncer, und
M.Monroe, who ended her life
with drugs. Shirley Temple. Diana
Dors. Dietrich. Dylan. ’l‘.E.
Lawrence (ofAmbia) Tony Curtis
Aubrey Beardsley, the fine ink
artist of the late l9th century,
Laurel and Hardy, and Karl Marx
to name a few. Why should they
be invited to n funeral of this
nature. Perhaps because each of
them suffered in their own way;
each was talented and perhaps
tormented by tlicmsclvos and/or
their peers. Is all this just rm
elaborate “put-on." ] think not.

A majority of the songs on this
album deal wilh themes of lone-
liness getting older. and ap-
proaching death. In the second
part of this article, I shall discuss
references to these themes In scv~
and of the songs on the album.

The World Is His Stage

by Mary Eileen O’Donnell

Joseph Balfior is the Agnes E.
Futterer guest lecturer in the De-
partment of Theatre at the State
University of New York at Al-
bany. Belfior came to State Uni-
versity this year with a solid back-
ground in professional and educa—
tional theatre experience. He is
teaching graduate and under-
graduate level courses in acting,
directing, and scene study.

A graduate of St. John's Univer-
sity, Mr. Balfior received his thea-
tre training in New York at the
Actor‘s Lab and the New Studio,
as well as two years work with
Sanford Meisner in the profes-
sional class at Neighborhood Play-
house. He also studied voice for
opera and musical comedy for six
years

As a professional actor, Joseph
Balfior has performed in many
productions on Broadway, off-
Broadway, the West coast, and
summer stock. and has toured
both in dramas and musicals. On
television he appeared as a regular
for two years on the Ed Wynn
Show, as well as appearances on
the Danny Thomas Show, the
Alan Young Show, the Jimmy
Durante Show, and the Ed Sulli-
van Show. He has also assumed
roles in dramatic shows on NBC
and CBS. Balfior is a member of
Equity, Screen Actor‘s Guild,and
AFTRA, the three major acting
unions of state, screen, and tele-
vision.

Balfior has directed Joan Muir in
the Town Hall production of
PSALMS OF DAVID, us well as
three Off-Broadway plays, and
countless non-professional pro-
ductions.

Mr. Balfior‘s experience in edu-
cational theatre ranges from
Speech and Drama teacher in high
schools to heading the Playhouse
School of Drama in New York, to
coaching professional actors. For
thirteen years from [95/] Lo
1967, he lived and worked in New
York City's Henry Street Settle-
ment as a drama teacher. There
Bulfior originated and supervised
the “Arts-for-Living Program,“ a
highly successful experiment in
the use of the performing arts to
help culturally and economically
tlisrulvuntngcd children find self
expression and self esteem, us well
as to develop disciplines for living.
Bulfior has also served as theatre
consultant to several other com-
munity centers.

As u-profcssionul actor, Joseph

Balfior has performed with
Beatrice Lillie, John Ram, Edith
Piaf, Mel Tourme, and the original
Gloria Swanson. Mr. Balﬁor has
written four children’s plays, and
is in the process of writing a book
based on his Henry Street Settle-
ment drama work in New York.

Aside from course instruction in
acting and directing, Balfior con-
ducts acting workshops for his
students. Mr. Balfior was also
appointed to supervise State Uni-
versity Theatre's contributions to
St. John's Community Project in
Albany's South End, a program

sity Theatre’s final major produc-
tion of the season, YOUR. OWN
THING, a musical based on
Shakespeare’s TWELF'I‘H NIGHT,
May 13-17.

An advocate of strict self-
discipline in the training of the
actor Mr. Balfior is nonetheless a
patient, skillful teacher, sensitive
to the needs and growth of his
students. He enjoys a tremendous
rapport with his students, who
were elated by a recent announce-
ment by Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Theatre, Dr. Paul Bruce
Pettit, that Joseph Balfior's con-
tract was renewed for another
year.
