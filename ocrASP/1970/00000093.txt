Editor's Note: As a result of
Dialogue many dcparments have
been confronted with proposals to
alter their committee composi-
tion. The following is a brief
wrap-up of what has occurred in
two departments. Contributing re-
porters are Vicki Zeldin and
Martha Nathanson.

The Student Advisory Commit-
tee to the English Department
(ESAC), which is exactly what its
name implies it to be--an advisory
body, proposed 50-50 faculty stu-
dent representation and voting
power on all departmental com-
mittees.

This proposal was discussed at
several student-faculty open meet-
ings and at several closed depart-
ment meetings. At the open meet-
ings feelings on the issue were
mixed with some people voicing
the fear that students would
always vote in a "power block."
Others felt that the department
was fine as it was and could not
seem to understand why people
wanted changes.

Those favoring 50-50 said that
it was a student's “inalienable
right to be recognized as a human
being." Others dismissed the fear
that students would always vote
against the faculty. They cited the

formation.

Dr. Walter Knotts English De-
partment Chairman, announced at
a special department meeting held
last week that if 50-50 were to be
passed he would resign. Last Fri-
day the proposal was brought to a
vote at a closed department meet-
ing and was defeated by one vote.

ESAC members and faculty are
now working to amend the pro-
posal so that it can be reintro~
duced, and hopefully pamed.

The Biology Department has
seven committees only three of
which have student repreA
sentatives. Representation is not
50-50, but there are several non-
voting student representatives
from the Biology Club and the
Biology honorary, Tri Beta. They
participate in the Undergraduate
instruction Committee, Student
Advisement Committee, and
Graduate Program Committee.
There are no students on the
Personnel and Appointment Com-
mittee but “student opinion is
considered" in the form of ques-
tionnaires. All students have been
welcomed at open faculty meet-
ings and Biology majors are kept
informed of what is happening
within the department.

Pall Of Legislature Finds

Division Between Parties

by - Bob Wamer

In a recent poll of the New York State
Legislature conducted by the ASP dated Mar. 12,
1970, 204 State Senators and Assemblymen were
questioned on seven issues pertinent to college
students. The results of the poll and the conclusions

drawn by the ASP reporter are as follows:

Only 32% of all Democratic legislators and 23%
of all Republicans replied. The Republicans how-
ever, outnumber the Democrats in the Senate by
nine seats and in the Assembly by eleven. There-
fore, the poll is invalid insofar as it is not indicative
of the mood of the present session. But it is
interesting to note that the Democrats, who are in
the minority were more responsive to a college

newspaper's poll.

The first question asked was: "Do you favor the
lowering of the voting age to 18? And if so, by 1972
or by 1980?" 87% of all the legislators who replied
favored the proposal, 7% opposed it, and 6% had no
answer. And 74% of those assenting, called for the

law to take effect in 1972.

The break-down by party and geographical loca-

tion is as fOIIOWs:

YES NO NO ANSWER 1972 1930
100% 0%
66%
13%
86%

The pattern that you see here is basically no
different than on the other six questions. The
Democrats are consistently more liberal than the
Republicans, and the downstate area is more liberal
than the rest of the state. The former seems to
dispell the myth (at least in New York State) that
the two major parties are like tweedle- dee-and

Democrats 97% 0% 3%
Republicans 76% 16% 8%
NYC, Metro 89% 3% 8%
Upstate 81% 19% 0%

“Do you favor abortion repeal. reform. or no
change at all," was the second question. Even
though the abortion bill was passed already, the

results will show where the support camc from.

From the last two questions, we see that the New
York City area is not as liberal as the Democratic
Party, which shows that the suburbs are mostly
Republican and that within the five boroughs the
Democrats do not have complete domination (Le.

Queens, and Staten island).

The third question deals with the repeal of the
Blaine Amendment. Both this issue and the abortion
issue, we find the greatest support among upstaters,

and among the Republicans.

fact that many faculty L

were already serving on commit-

on the basis of this experience the
fear of a “power play" was ob-
viously unfounded. Most students
felt that they were capable of
deciding on department policy,
and stated that since much of this
policy directly affected them they
should be allowed to help in its

Again, the Democrats. as a party, seem to be by
far more liberal than any other group; and upstate
is more right-wing than the other groups.

The next question was concerned with the war in
Vietnam. The Legislators were given a spectrum of
choices to which they could pin-point their posi-
tion.

35% favored immediate withdrawal, 50% gradual
withdrawal (or Nixon's plan, roughly), none favored
either no withdrawal or an increase in American
involvement, and 15% had no answer. The break-
down is as follows:

Gradual
Now withdrawal No No Answer
Democrats 62% 35% 0% 0%
Republicans 49;, 64% '0% 32%
Downstate 47% 42% 0% 11%
Upstate 7% 74% 0% 19%

The Democrats seemed to have moved to the left
on the war since the 1968 campaign, and the
Republicans are holding on tenaciously to Nixon's
slow withdrawal and Vietnamization. The Demo-
crats, it seems are taking a liberal foreign policy
platform, whereas the Republicans campaigned in
1968, on a rather vague, mildly dovish platform. to
combat the Democrats at the polls.

On the welfare issue, 24% favor a large increase in
welfare aid, 39% favor more moderate raises, 9%
want no raises, 9% want moderate decreases, and
none called for large reductions in welfare aid. 19%
had no answer The breakdown is as follows:

Moderate
Moderate No Decrease NA,
31% 3% 0% 21%
48% 16% 20% 16%

Republicans

Large
Demo 4 5%
Repub 0%
Downstate 34%
Upstate 0%

It is interesting to note that not a single
Democrat called for any decrease in aid, while no
Republican called for large increases. This domestic
issue, more economic and social than political, has
been one of the greatest liberal vs. conservative
conflicts in American history, and it still is if the
results of the poll are correct. We find here a deep
division between the two American ideologies of
liberalism and conservatism, those who favor gov-
ernment Assistance to the poor, and those who are
inclined to disfavor it,

On the timely issue of police on college cam
poses the Legislators seemed to be inclined to favor

"Vol. IV” No. l8

Patriots,

ALBANY STUDENT
PRESS

State University of New Yorlr at Albany

Panthers

Seek Involvement

by .1. Stephen Flavin

The New Left promises things
"are going to be heavy in New
Haven this weekend. A lot of
right-wing groups are coming
down; cops may use them to
provoke us. Expect trouble!"
Spring’s radicals and disenchanted
are sprouting in new abundance
like "weeds" in the American
Garden of Eden.

“Power to the People!” The
speaker stood amazed. A trickle
of “right on" scarcely audible
were all to be “heard?” from 300
of Albany State's “apathetic silent
majority." Maddy Goldstcin,
speaking for the Patriot Party,
told those gathered they had a
"very nice, new comfortable
school also vcry isolated. thn l
toured Albany, i could see places
in the community where people
were starving, (lying, they have
cold water flats, no stoves. We
have to do something to help
them. There is no time to waste
anymore!

Patriots come in all sixes and
shapes and from all social back-
grounds. They are trying to
“break down the white racists"
because the Black Panthers' means
and goals are the same as the
White Patriots‘. Both parties de-
sire change of the oppressive
system and replacement with a
system “of the people, for the
people". Poverty, like death, is a
“great equalizer",

Jimmy Grace, from Chicago‘s
north side, never finished high
school. He felt “out of place
here". For carpeting he had “wall
to wall roaches". But now he is a
Patriot. Patriots believe in the
people, believe in the country, but
not in the oppressive system.
“Socialism is a better way of life.
In the ghettoes, we live under a
socialistic system--we borrow
from our neighbors and share
what we can".

“People should own the facto-
ries, not just one rich man." The
Patriot and Panther Parties are
sponsoring free breakfast and
lunch programs, clothing drives,
workshops and care centers. The
government is not responsive to

the needs of the people. “Stu-
dents must get back into the
communities, get back with their
people and show them the way
out. To survive, we must teach the
people to live and communicate."

Though the Patriot Party fol-
lows Marxist-Lenninist views, they
are not Communist. “The Com-
munists have sold their people
out".

Jamal, arrested when he was 16
for “plotting to burn New York
City department stores", now 17
and free on $100,000 bail, stood
before an awakened audience.

“Capitalists are violating the
rights of people in the name of
profit. The was in Viet Nam is for
profit. We cann’t stand back
and wish for things to change; We
must work and make them
change. To stop racism, we have
to start a front here.“

Jamel recognises the attacks
against thiI Black Panthers as “-
attacks against all oppressed
people plotting to destroy facism,

General Electric Requests

Probe of Collegiate Press

NEW YORK--(CPS)--Radical
politics in the student press have
prompted General Electric, the
nation's number two war con-
tractor, and potentially a big re-
cruiting advertiser in the campus
press to attempt to blacklist stu-
dent newspapers whosc editorial
line has “gone off the far end," in
GE's view.

The U.S.Student Press Associa
tion (USSPA) has temporarily
thwarted the move, however, by
persuading the National Educa-
tional Advertising Service (NEAS)
to withdraw it’s cooperation.

National college advertising is
handled exclusively by NEAS, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Read
er's Digest. NEAS has been seek-
ing an advertising contract with
GE for the last six months, and
when GE two weeks ago request-

ed “an analysis of current college
newspapers including the extent
to which they have become propa-
ganda organs for radical student
organizations,“ NEAS agreed to
conduct such a study,

Fifteen editors of student news
papers from around the country
telegraphed Congressman John
Moss (D-Calif.) April 19 asking his
Freedom of Information Commit-
tee to investigate GE‘s threat to
the editorial freedom of the stu-
dent press.

NEAS, in a letter to its advisory
committee the day after the GE
request, outlined its cooperation
with GE. NEAS General Manager
Bert Macmannis said he would
construct the GE analysis from
copies of college newspapers on
file in the checking department of
his New York Ofﬁce.

However word of the analysis
leaked out last week when USSPA
in Washington obtained copies of
GE's letter to NEAS and the
NEAS memo to its advisory com-
mittee, USSPA called GE to con-
firm the story, and GE's Educa-
tional Communications Manager
E.J. Clark readily admitted re-
questing an analysis by NEAS,
citing GE‘s concern for “credi-
bility" among readers of student
newspapers.

Macmannis was surprised to
learn that word of the analysis
had leaked out and he quickly
agreed to USSPA's suggestion that
NEAS abandon the analysis.

maintains that Macmannis's agree‘
ment to conduct in secret the

llarines Stand By
for Panther llally

Some four thousand marines
and army airborne troops are
standing by in the New England
area, ready to move into New
Haven, Connecticut if violence
should erupt at a Black Panther
rally at Yale University.

They were stationed there as a
"precautionary measure" by
Attorney General John Mitchell,
who acted at the request of Conn-
ecticut governor John Dempsey.

The state national guard has also
been alerted by the governor.

Even campus police have gone
to great lengths in an expectation
of violence. A “command post”
has been set up, complete with a
fall back position in case the
forward area is overrun.

Valuable objects have been
moved away from windows at the
campus libraries and art gallery.

All Yale University student
groups pledge non-violence but it
 expeClcd that one radical group
from Boston has been purchasing
guns. Yesterday. police arrested
two youths for possessing explos-
ives. And there has been a recent
upsurge of gun thefts in the New
Haven arca--including 280 riot
guns equipped with bayonets,
stolen at the beginning of the

eek.

The May Day rally is expected
to attract some 35,000 demon-
strators to protest the murder trial
of Black Panther leader Bobby
Scale and seven of his followers.
They are accused of torturing an
alleged police informer.

Among those scheduled to ap-
pear during the three days of
rallies are Dave Dellinger, Abbie
Hoffman, Ralph Abernathy, Tom
Hayden, William Kunstler, and
John Froines. Rock bands will
also appear.

Pro-Panther activity has been
running high at the Yale Univer-
sity campus for the past few days.

Wednesday, Vice-President
Agnew verbally chastised the pre-
sident of Yale and urged him to
resign. This was a result of state-
ments made last week by him in
which he claimed the Panthers
could not receive a fair trial any-
where in the United States.
