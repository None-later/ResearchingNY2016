Happenings Varied

by Gary Ricciardi

inc weekend of May 8 is the
annual Parcnts' Weekend at the
University, That Weekend, men
and women with salt and pepper
hair a self-conscious air, will
come to college to see their child-
ren and take part in conscious-
ness-expanding activities sche-
duled for them. These include a
movie, a lightshow,diulogues and
athletic events. Attendance will
not be taken, but would be appre-
elated.

Parents may eat in quad (lining
rooms and Saturday evenng there
will be a I’arents‘ Weekend ban-
quet in the quad dining balls with
tickets costing $3.75 each. insur-
ance policies will be sold at the
door. but organizers of Parents'
Weekend say this is no more than
a routine precaution, “Nothing to
gel uptight about."

Meal tickets for parents and
commuters can be picked up in

must be in by May lst. It is
expected many will have reserv-
ations. Students, of course, may
use their meal cards.

There will be a concert Saturday
night featuring “The Guess Who"
and “Seals and Crofts." Concerl
lickets must be bought by stu-
dents for their parents, and tickets
will cost the regular nonvtax card
price of $400. They are not yet
on sale.

A Parents' Weekend Celebration
will be held in the Rathskeller.
Beer and peanuts will be sold for
ten cents, and a live band, “The
Other Side," will be featured. The
time for this has not yet been
established

The co-chairmen of Parents
Weekend are Rubin Aznr (who
may be reached at 45740513), and
Raenn Endick (457-8004 ).

It is to be noted that the Satur-
day morning reception for parents
will not be held on State Quad
this year. The decision not to
allocate the money for the event
was made by the State Quad
Board, under the leadership of
Mitch Klein.

Students living on State Quad
should not bring their parcnls to
any of the other quads, since
arrangements have been made for
the parcnls of the quad residents
only.

 

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS
Athletic

In Final

Central Council, at its last meet-

ed the Athletic Advisory Board

Despite arguments by Dr.
Werner and the AA Board that
money for conventions, steak din-

thousands of dollars serves as

a reward for the School's
athletes, Council countered with a

'cogent attack of the budget. It
was stated that Student Associa-
tion must cut funds severely in all
its subsidiaries, and the area of
athletics is no different. Council
could see no rationalization for
not cutting AAB's budget while
cutting the budget of every single
subsidiary of SA.

Council also felt that not
enough students are affected by
Intercollegiate athletics (only 400
are directly involved) to spend the

Rock Fest

Planned for June

by John Zeh
College Press Service

NEW YORK—(CPS)- Plans fora
three-day summer rock festival on
a Harrisburg, New York farm June
26-28 have been announced here
at a press conference that reflect-
ed the skepticism accompanying
such ventures these (lays. Report»
ers from the established media
seemed concerned about such is-
sues as crowd control and drug
abuse, while "freaks" from the
underground press worried that
another rock ripoff was under-
way.

Executive producer for “The
Festival at Andy Williams' Farm"
is Budd Filippo, a promoter who
booked “Fantastiks” on campuses
and organized American tours of
early English groups. He has
formed Filippo Festivals Inc,
with hopes of producing regular
musical events on the Lewis
County site. The organization has
purchased the entire 12-10 acres
from Williams, a 72-yearvold dairy
farmer

Aboard the Filippo venture are
Michael Lang and friends, who
were involved in last summer's
Woodstock Festival. Lung, along
with John Carpenter, just. aban-
doned the upcoming Toronto Fes-
tival because it seemed to be
falling apart.

The scheduled dates are June
26, 27, and 2H, with the grounds
opening on the 24th for early
arrivers who want to camp out.
Camping, parking, and admission
to the daily l2-hour shows costs
$20. Tickets will be available
through 'l‘ieketron agencies. The
promoters are announcing that
ticket sales will be limited to
advance sales of 100,000, and
seem uncertain about what to do
if they are deluged. 'l‘hcir archi-
tect says the facilities will be built
to accomodntc as many as
400,000 if necessary.

The promoters say they expect
people to buy tickets and not
expect a "freebie." Filippo pub-
licist Chester Fox was quick to

 

of merchandise.

 

WE ARE SORRY!

Since the start of the semester our delivery vehicles
have been robbed six times. Three of these incidents in
the last two weeks. Due to this recent rash of robberies
we are placed in the position of charging a delivery charge
for all orders to the uptown campus. We apologize to our
many loyal customers for this action, but we can no
longer absorb the cost of repairs to our vehicles and loss

It is a shame that so many good students have to be
penalized for the actions of a sick minority but we feel

we have gone as far as we can.

WALT'S SUBMARINES INC.

assure reporters that security forc-
es would be present only to help
people, not police the crowd.
“They are not going to have any
guns or clubs " he emphasized.

Land and Scaltro have been
busy lining up talent, but have
announced no definite committ<
ments. Scaltro said Monday that
Led Zepplin and Ten Years After
will probably be headliners, as
they are available. He also men-
tioned the Band, Joe Cocker and
Janis Joplin.

The overall budget will exceed
$1 million, “half of which is
already available," he said. Ticket
money will be held in escrow to
assure ticket refunds should they
be necessary.

huge sums asked by AAB for
varsity baseball, soccer, bullet-
ball, etc.

Council, in an amendment, sets
ceiling of $15.50 per year for the
athletic assessment assuming that
mandatory tax remains. If it does
not, however, the tax could be
raised to meet expected costs.

In a bill introduced by Vic
Looper, Council wholeheartedly
and unanimously passed a bill that
urges that Council, the University
Senate, and the Administration
enthusiastically commit them-
selves tw recruiting blacks for all
positions throughout the univer-
sity community.

Part of Looper's expression of
his feelings on the night of his last
Council meeting is as follows: Our
society has'penalized blacks in
many ways, some noticeable and
others subtle. The University is an
integral part of the society and
Student Association is a vital part
of the University. In the past I
have felt that the Student Associa-
tion, the University and the so-
ciety at large should make amends
for the past injustices by treating
everyone fairly and equally. I now
feel that this is not enough. I now
feel that the society has an affirm-
ative obligation to better the posi-
tion of blacks. I also fell that the
Student Association should do
what it can to rectify this situa-
tion by actively recruiting and
appointing blacks to positions of
influence so the black point of
view will be adequately repre-
sented."

oppression and racism. Bobby
Scale and other Panthers are fight-
ing for their lives. Scale and other
Panthers are being framed by the
FBI. The FBI kidnapped and mur-
dered a Panther, claimed he was
an informer, and charged the Pan-
thers with the kidnap and murder.

“The pigs are trying to make an
example out of Bobby. If they
execute him, we're going to seize
the night and hold back the day,
and there won‘t be any light for
days!“

Jamal does not distinguish be-
tween viewer and oppressor.
"Apathetic people are just as bad
as the oppressors and active racists
who kidnap people and send them

to kill and be killed in Viet Nam.
You have to become John
Brown-«NOW. Black people are
tired of waiting! We‘ve been wait-
ing for 450 years".

Events at New Haven this week-
end may only be a drop in the
bucket. To some people, the show
of support will be an encouraging
sign, especially after 450 years of
"waiting to be free." To others,
the demonstration may be inter-
preted as another step by radical
long hairs and misguided youth in
their search for truth 'and identity.

if the remnants of the
“vested interests" have hired in-
citers and the pigs attack us, “We
are going to defend ourselves-We
are not musochists! All power to
