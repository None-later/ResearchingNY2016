Twenty Things You Can
Do For Our Planet Earth

1. Don‘t use colored facial tis-
sues, paper towels, or toilet paper.
The paper dissolves properly in
water. but the dye lingers.

2. Use containers that decom-
pose readily. Glass bottles don't
decompose. Bottles made ofpoly-
vinyl chloride give off lethal
hydrochloric acid when inciti—
erated.

3. Don't buy unreturnable cori-
tainers. Hold aluminum-can pur»
chase to a minimum.

4. At the gas station, don‘t let
the attendant “top off" your gas
tank, this means waste, and pot-
luting spillage.

5. If you smoke filter-tip
cigarettes don’t. flush them down
the john. They‘ll ruin your
plumbing and clog pumps at the
sewerage treatment plant.

6. Stop smoking.

7. Stop littering. If you see a
litterer, object politely (Excuse
me, sir. I think you dropped
something).

8. If you‘re a home gardener.
make sure fertilizer is worked
deep into the soil-don‘t liose it
off into the water system.

9. Don‘t bity or usr DDT.

10. If you don't really need ii
car don't buy a car, Motor vehi-

cles contribute a good half of this
country 's air pollution.

11. Bug gasoline manufacturers
to get the lead out. ’l‘etraethyl
lead additives are put in gas to
help an engine's perfomance: they
can build up in your body to a
lethal dose. Indiana Standard Oil
Co. has a lead free fuel now
(Amoco).

12. There‘s only so much wa-
ter. Don't leave it running. If it.
has to recycled too fast, treatment
plants can‘t purify it properly.

151. Measure detergents care-
fully. If you follow manufacturers
instructions you'll help cut a third
of all detergent pollution.

lxl. Since the prime offender in
detergent pollution is not suds l)th
phosphates, demand to know how
much phosphate is in the (ICLL‘I"
gent you're buying. Write the
manufacturer. newspapers. Con«
grcssmen, the FDA.

[5. Never flush away what you
can put in the garbage. Especially
unsuspected organic cloggers like
cooking fut, coffee grounds or tea
leaves.

To Lennig

An open letter to Professor
Arthur Lennig, SUNYA,

Propaganda, as you noted last
Wednesday night, is relative to
those involved. "Triumph of the
Will" depicted Adolph Hitler and
associated as able and powerful
leaders of a united Germany (les-
tined to rule the world and the
films were produced to “educate”
the German people of this, To
“Westerners " or non-Germans,
the films were high caliber “pro-
paganda” to incite hatred and
kindle feelings of nationalism.

Your statement “You all
would agree that Kunstlcr could
speak on campus," net with no
objections from approximately
200 students gathered for your
movie and lecture. But you ex-
pressed doubt “if Robby Skelton
(Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan) could speak here." Thouin
it is doubted Skclton could draw
1"? of the assemblage Kunstler
did. no one saw you questioned
whether he could be allowed to
speak here. One student noted,
“Perhaps Ncil Kelleher wouldn‘t
allow people to speak here, but I
have no objection."

If anyone were denied permis-
sion to speak before any public
gathering because of his or her
social or political views. then we
have created, live, another Nazi
Germany.

When Kunstler spoke, you said
it reminded you of the speeches
madc in Nazi Germany with raised
fists and cries “Power to the
Puople!’ substituting for raised
hands and “Sieg lleil!" You
Weren't alone,

But the spcclor of a police
statc is more evident in oratory
like this:

The streets of our country are
in turmoil, universities are filled
with students rebelling and riot-
ing. Communists are seeking to
destroy our country. Russia is

the Republic is in danger. Yes.
danger from within and without.
We need law and order. ch,
without law and order our nation
cannot survive. Elect us and we
will resotrc law and order."

Normalcy Returns

To SUNY Buffalo

by AI Senia

Conditions iit the State Univer-
sity of Buffalo campus are return-
ing to normal following last Feb-
ruary‘s "police riot" and the stu-
dent strike in March. Acting Presi-
dent Regan lias resigned his posi-
tion and all city police are off the
campus.

An estimated $80,000 worth of
damage occurred as a result of the
student-police confrontations,

Recently, the student body vot-
cd for a gradual phase-out of thc
campus ROTC program. No new
cnrollces will be accepted after
this semester.

Tltc Erie County grand jury,
meanwhile. has launched an inves-
tigation of the disturbances. The
personal records of 61 peoplcr-
including 15 faculty members
who were sentenced to lit) days in
prison on April 17, have been
subpeonocd.

At least 6 student leaders haVc
been arrested as a result of the
investigation; future arrests are
anticipated.

Financial records of the faculty-
student association and the stit-
dent publications board have also
been subpeonoed.

It. has been learned that thr-
State Board of Regents has re-
quested an investigation of UB's
compliance with the “oath of
allegiance“ required by all state
employees,

The names of those employees
who have not signed such oaths
are being compich into a list by
the Central Administration here in
Albany. University officials claim
the directive is “an administrative
thing."

Also, an :ulininistralivc tribunal
set up by Itcgan, had been con-
ducting “clandestine” hearings for
Si weeks and supplying lllt' grand
jury with information. This lri»
bunal runs counter to the consti-
tittions of the University of Hilf-

It is also contrary to the recom-
mendations supplied by an earlier
administrative investigative com-
mission headed by William Green-
er, a law school professor. That
commission stroneg criticized the
administration for the role it
played in the disturbances.

About three weeks ago. the Buf-
falo Common Council amended
the disorderly conduct code. It
now prohibits “the printing or
uttering of abusive, dangerous, or
obscene language, including the
word ‘pig' or ‘pigs' when directed
at government officials, school ad-
ministrators, or police officers."
The city attorney warned that this
move may be deemed unconstitu-
tional by higher courts.

The council Iiad also voted to
request returning state university
Chancellor Samuel Could investi-
gate “The Spectrum," UB‘s stu-
(lciit newspapci‘. The council
claimed it was a “threat to com-
munity standards."

Finally a “Ilaycs 15 Defense
Fund" has been set up to raise
money for the arrested faculty
members. They could face 16
months in prison on criminal coir
tempt charges, Indications are
they will take their case to the
Supreme Court, if necessary. The
Univorsity administration is pres-
sing the contempt charges amid
reports that radical faculty incin-
lit-rs may be fired on charges of
“moral tiiritude,“
