Track Wins: McCarg,Moshenberg Star

by Dave Fink

Ringling Brothers probably used
the name ﬁrst, but according to
track and field coach R.K. Mun-
sey, his 1970 varsity edition is
indeed the “greatest show on
earth.” The team traveled to New
Paltz Wednesday and were treated
very nicely as they annihilated
their hosts, 112-33 to run their
record to 5-0 for the season.

Receiving Coach Munsey's “fick-
le feather" award as the foremost
performer of the meet was junior
Saul Moshenberg, who broke his
own team record in the long jump
by going 23 feet, 1% inches, 96
inch of what Munsey thinks will
qualify Saul for the NCAA small
college nationals. Moshenberg also
took first place in the triple jump
and ran a fine 10.6 leg in the 440
yard relay.

The 400 relay team, called by
Munsey “Handleman's Dream" af-
ter Jay Handleman, who ran the
second leg in 10.7, finished first in
a time of 22.5, breaking the

Women’s

The Women's Intercollegiate
Tennis team began the Spring
season with two victories. April
17, Brockpoft was defeated in a
7-0 shutout. April 18, Lahman
College, a formidable opponent,
lost to SUNYA 4-3. A match
which was scheduled for April 25
against Westfield State was cancel-
led due to rain.

The turnout for team try-outs
was unexpectedly large this sea-
son. The coach, Mrs. Mann, was
forced to cut quite a number of
girls from the team; however. she
was pleased with the enthusiastic
interest from the University com-
munity.

Team members include: Ronnie

school record and probably quali-
fying the contingent for the small
college regionals. Cliff McCarg
opened the race with an excep-
tional 10.8 first leg and Marty
Amerikaner finished with an un-
believable 10.4 anchor, equiva-

lent, according to Munsey, to a
9.7 100 yard dash.

McCarg also finished first in the
100 and the 220 with times of 9.8
and 21.6 while Amerikaner was
second in both, running 10.1 and
22.5 respectively.

Other firsts were Tom Moore in
the- pole vault, Don Van Cleve in
the shot put, and Denny Hackett
in the mile. The latter also ran the
440 intermediate hurdles for only
the second time and finished
third.

Smith Tallies Two but
RIT Whips Stichmen, 12-8

by Andy Egol

The Albany State Varsity
Lacrosse team, hindered by many
last period penalties, dropped a
closely contested game to RIT
Wednesday by a score of 12-8.

The STate stickmen played a
fine game and kept up with RIT
until the middle of the last period.
The score at the end of the third
period was 9-8 and according to
Coach Muse it was the best quar-
ter the team played all year and

Sailing

Thc SUNYA Sailing Club com-
pctcd ill a regatta last Saturday
which was marked by confusion
and frustration. Representing Al‘
bany were Glenn Fadcn, Chris
Follows, Dan Levin, and Gail Hen-
ry,

The sailing teams of over
twenty schools converged on the
docks of the N.Y. Maritime Col-
lege, Saturday morning to race in
three different regattas. From the
onset it was clear that Maritime
had overcxtcndcd itself in offering
to host the lhrec events simul-
taneously. Only four skipjack sail-
boats were available for the five
schools scheduled to race in one
regatta: Albany, Cornell, Rutgers,
Suffolk and Maritime. Asa result,
a boat rotation system had to be
worked out with one team sitting
out each race. The situation was
further complicated by the alter-
nation of races among the three

fense situations.

The team travels to meet with
Geneseo this Saturday. Geneseo
has lost this season to RIT by one
goal, but the coaches feel confi-
dent to come back with a victory.

On Tuesday the State JV Stick-
men lost a really close game to the
Siena JV. The score was tied until
the middle of the last period when
Siena scored to make the final
score 6-5. Scoring for State were
Andy Egol with two goals, Bruce

Gottfried all with one each.

regattas. One course was used for
all the races with ten-minute inter-
vals between successive starting
signals, This system failed because
the boats could not sail back to
the docks after a race to switch
crews and return to the water in
time for the next start. To correct
the problem, the race committee
changed the starting sequence, but
neglected to inform the Albany
tom of the change.

To make things worse, the
races were postponed for an hour
to allow a rowing race to proccdc.
It was explained by the race com-
mittee that the wake from the
rowboats would capsize a sailboat.
While this seemed rather in-
crcdulous the strong wind con-
tributed to continuous capsizing.
A saturated Rutgers team with-
drew al'tcr thrcc dunkings.

As darkness approached, an ab-
breviated course was employed
and all the races completed. The
adversities proved too mucll for
the Albany team, however, as
they finished fourth. Although
lhc team was disappointcd in their
showing, they were relieved that
the ordeal was over.

In league I action, APA‘s B team
avenged its A team by defeating
TXO 8-5. KB strengthened its
claim of being a contender by
defeating Potter Club 9-2. KB was
led by the fine pitching of Al
Zaremba and the hitting of Marty
Levi. KB is now 3-1. In other
action APA(A) defeated APA (B)
8-5. Paul Weiner pitched for the
victors. Potter Club got back in
the win column with a 10-6 vic-
tory over Purple Smoke. Artie
Dixon picked up the win for
Potter. TXO surprised
STB defeating them 8-4. A ﬁne
effort by Craig Fierstein led the
losers but it was not enough to
withstand a strong TXO attack.

UFO‘s defeated the Rayders 10-4.
The Zoo II crushed Formula I

over New

Paltz, 9-2

On Tuesday, the Great Dane
baseball team demolished a hap-
less New Paltz “squad” 9-2 behind
the pitching of Rich Spiers and
hitting of Al Reid and Jim Sandy.
Spiers allowed the only runs after
the game was well out of reach iii
the top of the ninth. Reid, off an
ankle injury sustainedi down
South, looked as though he was ill
fine form going 3 for 4 including a
booming triple to the left center
field fence. Sandy looks as though
he may be out of an early season
slump going 2 for 3 including a
line shot homerun over the left
field fence. Contrary to popular
belief the team morale at this
stage is very high. Many of the
players feel the toughest part of
the schedule is now behind them,
and feel as though they can go all
the way. Coming up this weekend
are games with Siena on Friday at
home and then a double header
with Lemoyne at Syracuse. Fresh-
man Nick Ascicnzo, and Junior Hi
Doolittle arc the probable starters.
Ascienzo is 2-1 lilld Doolittle [-2
but pitched a fine game his last
time out against tough Central
Connecticut.

Weaken
Hits

by Robert Rosenblum

There was a general lack of
diversity iii the music of Herbie
Mann and his quartet. But the
happy, and simple music was, if
rarely stimulating, not at all of-
fensive.

Guitarist, Sonny Sherrock, was
the most popular soloist. Breaking
ear drums with thousands of dici-
bels of sounds(cven drowning oiit
the drums) he bull shitted his way
thru chorus after chorus. Each
solo sounded and looked like all
electrocution. He produced
sounds that l have never heard
before. bill they were very repeti-
tive and lacked form. The crowd
enjoyed this giininicry.

Herbie Mann solocd proficient-
ly, blil not memorably. I've heard
him better. Bassist, Miroslav
Vituous was the inosl talented of
the group. All his solos were arco
and I would have to liked to sec
him pluch some of his stalcmcnls.

'l'cn WllCL‘l Drive was poorly
received by the audience. They
are a rather incompetent rock
group as a whole, but their reed
man has: :1 lol of promise. He
played a remarkable solo on so-

prano sax, with strains of Cole-
trane, and a nice tenor solo on a
slow blues called “Come live with
me." 'Live.‘ was also interesting
ill that no drums were used and
yet the rhytllm was felt through
out.

The concert was satisfactory,
but poorly attended. The obstan-
ant system and poor organization
on the part of Ten Wheel Drive
emptied the fall further. The
charts rarely used the large instru-
lnentatioil to its fullest degree.
The riff idea, which goes back to
James Brown, aild even as far as
Counl Basic of the '30‘s doesn't
wear well without a skillful ar-
ranger and crcalivc soloist. Ten
Whch Drive, for the most part,
had neither.

The Sunday evening concert was
partially successful, and partially a
lravesty. While the Ashley Bro-
thers were a dctraction and a
waste of time, and Mountain was
mediocre, Grand Funk was a tolal
success reaction-wise if nol artisti-
cally.

Notes

Ifloor while playing - the whole

corny gambit. But the music's the
rub, and that was excellent. Their
emotional range was limited and
each song was almost identical,
but it was exciting from the begin-
ning to the end of the second
encore.

The drummer was a good
rhythm man, but he‘was kidding
himself as a soloist. He contin-
ually attempted to club his drums
into submission and althouth be
displayed dexterity, there was no
evidence of imagination.

Mounluin is a rather ordinary
group. and following the excite-
ment of Grand Funk was an injus-
tice to them. Everything they did
was anti climactic .
