Interview Review

To the Editor.

Being an ex‘serviceman, I read
your recent article entitled, “An
Interview with an Ex-Gl." with
considerable interest. I too. ex-
perienced many of the undesirable
aspects of military life. but I must
question several points raised in
the interview.

The first point which i wish to
raise, concerns this individual's
claim of inability to secure a leave
for a period of two years. Early in
the article, it was stated that prior
to the individual‘s departure for
Germany he received a lll day
leave. The article also stated that
the individual turned 18 years of
age while enroute to that country.
Later in the article the following
statement was made: "1 had been
trying to get a lenVe for home now
for almost two years...l was still
only 18." Need i say more-the
contradiction is obvious.

My second point concerns this
individual's claim of racial pre-
judice. The article stated: "And
the prejudice... it depends; on
who's in power and who's in a
position to help their own-and the
blacks usually get the bottom."
The key word to keep in mind
here is “power."Any0ne who has
had military experience certainly
knows that although officers pos-
sess authority and power, it is
usually in name only. The real
power lies within the realm ofthe
non-commissioned officer. Statis-
tically speaking the majority of
N.C.O.'s in today‘s army are
black. If it does depend on who‘s
in power and who‘s in a position
to help their own, then it does not
follow that blacks usually get the
bottom.

The third aspect of this article in
which I find disagreement, is this
individuiil‘s experience with a
military courtAmartial. Concerning
this topic the article stated, “For
a court‘martial to take place, an
officer hits to bring charges. You
have an officer to prosecute, an
officer to judge, and an officer for
defense." Each individual upon
entry to the service, immediately
receives identical instruction, coir
ccrning his rights under the Uni-
form Code of Military Justice. Al
that time he is informed that
when and if court-martialcd, lie

reserves the option of trial by
officers or trial by peers
(N,C.O‘s). He is also informed

that he has the right to secure the
services of a civilian lawyer, if he
so wishes. Here again the article
tends to mislead the reader.
Although i cannot deny that
unjustices do exist within the lnlll‘
tary service, i feel that the opin‘
ion expressed in the article in
question tends to exaggerate these
pervasive aspects. Considering that
the contents of the article is the
mere conjecture of one individual,

I also feel that the ASP was in
error giving the interview front
page coverage. I hope that the
points I have raised will help the
readers of the ASP to see this
article in its proper prospective.

Job Well Done

Dear Sir:

As a former Army nonvcominis»
sioned officer, let me be the first
to commend you on the humor-
ous item appearing on the front
page of the issue of April 28. l
assume it was intended as humor
- all of the frightening, soul-sear-
ing encounters that led to Mr.
Rinault's near destruction and ul-
timate incarceration have been en-
dured by myself and countless
millions of others without the
resulting scars. Only a very select
few, whose emotional makeup
suits them for the role assumed by
Mr. Rinault appear at any one
time. Out of sheer selfishness,
perhaps, I thank God for that. I
had a job to do and i did it -- with
and through a great many people
- and despite the occasional ap-
pearance of one who could not
stand the heat, caused the balance
of us to assume their work load
along with ours and who were
ultimately replaced by capable
personnel.

All that Jazz

Bob Rosenblum:

in your article on April l7 on
the "Myths and Legends (if-Jazz,"
you seemed to feel that jazz has
been “persecuted” by the "classi-
cal music cstalilishnicnt," This
may have been true at its begin-
ning as it is at the start of any
musical form. You neglected,
however to mention the Slnlllill”
itics between jam and classical
music. Both can have great variety
of rhythm, melody, and instru-
mentation within each number.
You blatantly casl aside l’aul
Whitemaii's type of jazz. such as
Gershwin‘s “rhapsody in Blue"
and “American in Paris." lt (lid
indeed “su rvivc the decade" and is
very activer enjoyed today. The
non-orchestral type of jar. is also
still enjoyed, but the peiccs that.
will survch are those showing
originality (such as Brubeck's
“Time Out“). This is true of any
music.

Throughout musical history, or-
chestral composers have incor-
porated the cultural music of the
people. Jazz is indeed the music
of our country, for it expresses
our temperament. We should be
forever grateful to the Blacks for
having invented it.

Editorial Comment
MONSTER

Once the religious, the hunted and weary
Chasing the promise of freedom and hope
Came to this country to build a new vision
Far from the reaches of Kingdom and pope
Like good Christians some would burn the witches
Later some bought slaves to gather riches
And still from near and far to seek America
They came by thousands. to court the wild
But she patiently smiled, and then bore them a child
To be their spiril and guiding light
And when the lies with crown had been broken
Westward in saddle and wagon it went
And till the railroad linkcd ocean to ocean
Many the lives which had come to an end
While be bullied, stole and bought our homeland
We hegaii the slaughter of the red man
But still from the near and far to seek America
They came by thousands to court the wild
But she patiently smiled and bore them a child
To be their spirit and guiding light.
The Blue and Grey they stumped it
They sickcd it just like a dog
And when the war was over
They stuffed it just like a ling
Bill though the past has its share of injustice
Kind was the spirit in many a way
lint its prolcclois and fl icnds have been sleeping
Now us a inonslci and will not obey
'l'lic spnii was l'iccdoin and justice
lls kccpcis sccnicd generous and kind
lls lcadcis wcic supposed to scivc llic L‘Ullllll)
Now they don‘t pay it no iiiiiid
('ansc the people got fat and grew lazy
Now then vote is a meaningless joke
They babble about law and boat order
But it‘s just ilic echo of what they've been told
Yes :i inonslci‘s on the loose
li‘s pill our heads into the noose
Andjusl sits there watching
The cilicsbzive turned into jungles
And curriipiion is strangling the land
The police force is watching the people
And the peoplejnsl can‘t understand
We don't know how to mind our own business
The whole world has to be just like us
Now we are lighting a war over there
No matter who's the winner we can‘t pay the cost
Yes a nioiisler‘s on lhe loose
its put our heads in a noose
And just sits there watching
American when: are you now
Don't you care about your sons and daughters
Don't you know we need you now
We can‘t fight alone against the monster.

Campus Factions Outline
Strike Guidelines, Rationale

‘by Vicki Zeldin

Having filled the Campus Center
lobbies completely, the people
who came to learn the plans for
Tuesday's SUNYA strike, moved
to LC 2. Having filled LC 2, the
people, some 650-700 strong,
packed LC 7.

Mitch Silver, the first to speak
from lhe podium, said that he was
going to speak on why they should
strike but decided not to give an
intense analysis since “everyone
already knows." He did briefly
sketch the history of aggressive
U.S. actions over the last 20 years.
He also spoke of the McKarren
Act which provides that under
emergency the government can
detain (by locking up) anyone
they feel is causing trouble or is a
danger. Silver then referred to the
fact that many people did not
think the U.S. was capable of
genocide. But he said that we are
and went on to point to the sys-
tematic killings of the Black Pan-
thers. He wound up by saying that
"we can‘t sit idle, we must say no
to the governments actions. We
must say no."

“Fuck Peace until you have
power" were the opening words
of Vernon Bowen from the Black
Panther Party. He told the group
that there is a war here in the
U.S., a race war. He spoke of the
Connecticut 9, the New York 21
and other Panthers on trial as pri-
soners of war. He told the group
that Chairman Bobby must be
freed. Bowen said that “the
system must be overthrown be-
fore war can be ended because
this nation is on a war economy
and lives by dispensing war ma-
terials in the ghettos iind South
East Asia."

The Third World Liberation

Front, repiesented by Spencer
Jackson, wrs the next to present
its appeal. He too called on stu-
dents to support Bobby Seale, to
put down a system that supports
the Vietnam War. “Bring the War
Home is on the pillars,“ com-
mented Jackson, and this was met
with enthusiastic applause. Ad-
dressing himself mainly to the
white students he said “you’ve got
to be for real." He reminded them
that in order for this strike to be
effective it had to be taken ser-
iously, and also that Blacks had a
lot more at stake in this thing
than did the whites.

Barbara Pelton from Women's
Liberation and Eddie Shaw from
PYE both indicated that their or-
ganizations supported the strike.

Jim Maas then informed the
group of the strategy that would
be employed on Tuesday. It was
decided that the Humanities and
Social Science Buildings would be
the first to be closed because
“they have the heaviest student
traffic." The information center
of command post for the strike is
centered at the Fireside Lounge in
the Campus Center. Maas also in-
formed the students what to do
when confronted by students,
campus police, or "regular" po-
lice. He also warned the women
not to wear earrings, since the po-
lice like to drag women away by
them. Information on what to do
if tear gas was used was also giv-
en. He closed by saying that
“there will be no political prison-
ers on this campus."

Suggestions from the audience
were called for next. One student
said that the computer center
should be “attacked,” because
that would close the school.

Another student told students
to go to the library and take out
In many book: as they could. and

 

  

then pile them up in front of the
building. This suggestion met with
enthusiastic approval, and the
meeting began to break up with
many students heading toward]
the library. As they were leaving
appeals for money to help pay for
the printing costs of the “Strike
Paper" were made, iind Bowen
told the students “Anybody get-
ting high gets their ass kicked!"

Some students then proceeded
to the Library where‘ they re-
moved a number of books from
the shelves and placed them out-
side. Some books were thrown in
the fountains and several window:
were broken. A Fire alarm was
pulled in order to clear out the
Library, and security then pro-
ceeded to move the books back.
No one was arrested, but an inva-
tigation is being pursued. The
library will remain closed until at
least 12 pm. Tuesday.

Time to Act!

Support Urged for Strike

by Carol Huyies

The first steps toward the unifi-
cation and radicalization of the
State University of new York at
Albany were begun yesterday at ii
rally in the gardens behind the
Campus Center. Approximately
800 students heard three speakers
urge the complete shut-down of
the university as part of the na-
tionwide student strike.

John Kaufmann, a leader of the
New Left Organizing Committee
opened the rally with remarks
upon the rationale for the strike.
Realizing that “a lot of people
have trouble llnklnl Cambodia

. riff-SJ .Jw
State University of New York at Albany

with the Black Panther Party,"
Kaufmann attempted to clarify
this reasoning.

He cited the Koemer Report
and its recommendations regard-
ing the riots of the summer of
1968 as sounding like Viet Nam.
He carried this similarity to the
black interest in self-determina-
tion as the interest in self-deter-
mination by the Viet Cong and
Pathet lLao.

Kaufmann continued by offer-
ing reasons for white involvement
in black problems as manifested in
the New Haven 9 ’I‘rial."We are on
the vergeof race war in this coun-
try,"he asserted, a war whose re-
sult would be the victory of
George Wallace and Spiro Agnew,
and the disappearance of "what
little freedom we have left."

The second talk came from Ver-
non Bowenof the Black Panther
Party. He, too, equated the strug-
gle of the black people with the
war in Viet Nam and Cambodia.

Bowen defended Bobby Scale
and asserted that “the pigs mur-
dered Alec Rackley" not the
Black Panthers.

America is “trying to kill Bobby
and exterminate the Black Pun-
l.her party. If while people stand-
by l.hcrc will be a race war here
that America cannot endure."

“We can't stand-by and let. ()|ll'
people die needlessly!"

To clear with the government‘s
war against black people. a nation-
al strike is called. Bobby Scnlc'ii
trial, Cambodia, war research on
campus are all connected, Bowen
continued. “Education is now in
the streets!"

He stated that the Black Panther
Party was not inherently violent;

 

they are only in self-defense
against institutional violence.

“The time to talk is over. It’s
time to move." Bowen concluded.
“If Chairman Bobby dies, all
black people die. We've got to de-
fend ourselves.“

Spencer Jackson of the Third
World Liberation Front highlight-
ed the rally with an eloquent call
for massive strikes.

“White people in Albany and all
over America have been lulled in-
to a sense of complacency," he
began. Black people are also in
this situation and both races must
now awaken.

Nixon's entry into Cambodia is
only a foreshadowing. "Next is
Laos, next is the rest of Indo-
china.” Jackson links our com-
placency with recent events and
underlines the need for action.

New Haven demonstrated “disci-
pline and cool-headedness on the
part of the Black Panther Party
and liotheadedness on the part of
white radicals who got us gassed."
A national strike is now called
"until the government stops its
persecution," and ends all war.
Colleges must stop contributing to
the war machine."

Jackson reminded white stu-
dents of their own hassles with
parents lint slated lbal‘ it was
necessary to “overcome your per.
sonal hang-ups - because there's a
lot at stake."

“The Black Panther Party has
been saying 'solze the time before
the time seizes youl'and the time
Is now!" We must not before this
country draw“ as "into its own in-
sane drain."
