-seven groups are participating in

tractions will include pony rides

ful German Beer Garden.

Congressman Sam Stratton, frequently interrupted by hecklers, at-
tempted to address a large gathering of students yesterday afternoon.

Iliilll iloriri Supports Strike

is Revolutions

America is becoming more real,
at each instant the constituents
are making this society more
morally and ethicallysound by
electing the just and righteous
path. Student strikes are just ano-
ther of the continuously evolving
factors that will sum to the de-
struction of the most amoral na-
tion known to have ever existed in
man's history.

We do not not believe that a stu-
dent strike will change anything,
it will however, be one of the in-
ﬁnitesimal elements that will end
the negation that is America.
There are various methods of so-
cial confrontation that will sum to
the revolution, we acknowledge
that this is one of them. Silent
majorities, however, leave much
to be desired, we believe that a
majority should be most vocifero-

-us and most ardent in its desire

for freedom. Those who believe in
static commitments and non-
continuousiy changing methods,
are not in accord with the Third
World's revolutionary program.
We support the strike on the

grounds that it is one of the ele-
ments which will increment the
people's knowledge of the facist
government under which they
live, it will also increment the
frustration and henceforth the
revolution. We do not believe
America to be capable of peaceful
change, so we are preparing for
the War of Armageddon.

Student Hcckling
Stratton Cambodia Speech

by Martha Nathanson

Congressman Sam Stratton
spoke to the Albany students at 2
p.m. yesterday, on the lawn be-
hind the Campus Center.
Throughout the speech there was
constant heckling by the students
but Mr. Stratton remained calm
and smiling. A student reminded
the others that “we don't want
him elected,“ so “let him talk"
and then he'll hear what we have
to say.

Congressman 'Stratton stressed
the fact that US. policy was ba-
sically trying to stop aggression
before it was started. This was
why we formed the UN, NATO
and SEATO after World War II, to
prevent World War III. This is why
we went into Greece, Turkey, Ber-
lin, Korea, Lebanon, and Cuba, to
stop aggression, (and the list keeps
growing). At this point two ban-
ners were lowered from the bal-
cony saying "We Want Scale" and
“Liberate SE. Asia." Shouts si-
lenced Stratton.

Then the Congressman con-
tinued, saying that the reason we
were in Vietnam was to stop a
small aggression from becoming
big. The two policies of ending
the war are first, the one followed
for the past year which is pulling
out only as fast as the Vietnamese
can take over, and, the otherpro-
posed by Goodell, which is to pull
everybody out. The latter received
a big hand and cries of "pull ’em
out now." But, Stratton went on
and claimed that if we pull out we
will not restore peace. With every
de-escalation that the United
States has taken, we have asked
for a corresponding reduction

As students from Albany State
prepared to strike, their fellow
students across the nation mo-
bilized for paralch action. The aim
is to force the educational system
of this country to grind to a hull.
until the war ends.

as Publication

in Study Procedure Changes

The ASP Newsbonrd has voted
to discontinue publication of the
strident newspaper until such time
that u more desirable system for
publication is implemented. The
last issue of the ASP this semester
will be on Tuesday, May 5. and
lhc ASP will not publish this fall
unless u system Newsbonrd con-
siders ndcquutc is developed.

This action l'ollowr'd debate con-
cerning whclhcr working through
the cxisling syslcm could produce
a high qualin ncwspupcr, or
whether lhis could most [)I’llCli‘
cully hu m-complishcd through a

restructuring of the existing pro-
cess.

The primary reasons for News~
board's action are:

l) The personal sacrifice now
demanded of catch editor in order
to do an adequate job.

2) The technical inefficiencies of
the existing process.

it) The ASI“s failure to achieve a
high degree of cxccllcncc.

The amount of co-operution be-

from the North Vietnamese, and
if they do not respond We will do
something about it, he asserted.
So far, however, nothing has been
done. In the last two weeks the
North Vietnamese have been try-
ing to take over Cambodia. Now
as the rainy season is approaching,
there will not be as many attacks,
and we can start pulling out,
claims Stratton.

Then Stratton proceeded to the
subject of the Middle East con-
flict, and stated that it was a mis-
take not sending arms to Israel.
The US. has warned the Russians
from taking advantage by escalat-
ing farther or we will retaliate.
They, however, have put their
own soldiers in Egyptian planes.
Shouts went up of “1-2-3-4- we
don‘t want your fucking war."

Stratton :ended his speech by
saying that what we are doing in
Cambodia is promoting the with-
drawal from Viet Nam and avoid-
ing World War III. One thing we
don't want is war. He then added
sarcastically, “thank you for your
courtesy.”

Students yelled “strike!", and a
man by the name of Cardell,,who’s
against Stratton, charged that it
was men like Stratton who were
bringing the ideas of George 0r-
well to reality. What these men
are doing, he said was destroying
cities to save them. In Cambodia
they were using defensive action
to deprive the enemy of its sanc-
tuaries. Nixon promised that it
will only take a short while, just
as in Viet Nam. Cardell then asked
the students to join him in a
moment of silent prayer while
turning their backs on Stratton.

closed.

Stony Brook was ordered shut
for a “day of discussion"; future
strike plans were being formulated
by students.

Harper will hold a referendum
today calling for an “open end
strike"--n strike until the war ceas-
cs. It is expected to pass. Last
night about 2,000 students met
and formed an Action Committee,
composed of students, faculty,
graduate students, and campus
workers. This group will formul-
ntc future plans.

“Strike, strikel",
cried again.

A question and answer period
followed, but it turned out to be
more of a time for several stu-
dents to speak their minds. The
first student claimed that we only
go into countries where we have
an economic interest, but the
Congressman said that we have no
economic interest in Viet Nam.

The next stated that he and
others were in a rage and couldn't
understand how Stratton could
stand there so relaxed, when Bob-
by Seale was in jail and we were in
Veit Nam. “You can ’t answer that
you mother-fucker." Stratton did,
by saying that he thought he was
in a University.

One student made a comment
about the Congressman's Cadillac,
and Stratton said “my next Cadil-
lac will be my first." Another in-
dividual tried to point out that
the crux of the Congressman's
speech was about World War II.
Stratton quoted George Santa-
yans saying that “Those who are
unwilling to learn the lessons of
history are condemned to repeat
them." From World War II the
.small aggressions left unchecked
can lead to big aggressions and
those can lead to world wars. Up
to now it is pretty admirable that
we have succeeded in preventing
World War III, Stratton asserted.

The student moderator an-
nounced at this point that there
was a line forming on the right.
When this received a loud reac-
tion, he said, “all right, form it on
the left."

The next student who spoke
said that most of these kids
coudn‘t vote but that we could
point out the facts to our parents
who could. We are all immigrants
he went on, in a land taken from
the Indians who are now in reser-
vations. He then called Stratton a
nigger.
The last student who got up said
that we have been listening for
years and the reason we were rude
to him and not interested in dis-
cussion was that it was all bullshit.
The truth is the opposite of what
we have been told. They are kill-
ing more soldiers to save lives, us-
ing force to stop aggression, etc.
We are frustrated, the student
went on, and you, pointing to
Stratton, will find yourself before
a war crimes tribunal.

Stratton attempted to answer
one last written question but was
surrounded by many students
with their third fingers extended
towards him. He didn’t finish
answering “thank
you for your courtesy.”

Another student got up and said
“I hope everybody gets the pic-
ture, Stratton got a lot of votes
.out of this confrontation."
