Anne Of The Thousand Days

A Semi-Successful Film r

by michael nolin & diana dalley

The Hal Wallis Production,
ANNE OF THE THOUSAND
DAYS, was nominated for ten
Academy Awards, more than any
other film this year. The only
category it won was the relatively
minor Beat Costume Design. Per-
sonally we have never been parti-
cularly turned on by costumes,
but Margaret Furse's creations are
absolutely stunning. Even if the
film had nothing else to offer.
Miss Furse’sdesigns would make it
worthwhile if only as a fashion
show.

One of the categories which
ANNE lost was the Best Actor
category. The 1970 Awards
marked the sixth time Richard
Burton has failed to win. Mr.
Burton gives a good performance.
although definitely not one of his
best. (Becket) Actually just a
good performance from Burton is
a disappointment; some of his
worst performances have been
good performances.

The trouble with Burton as
Henry the VIII is that we have
seen it all before. Burton has
played so many costume dramas
that he can play them in his sleep.
It is as though he were saying "Ho
hum. another king."

The acting honors in ANNE OF
THE THOUSAND DAYS do not
go to Burton; nor do they go to
Genivieve BujoldI who does a
good job as the Anne of the title.
Anne Boleyn. Veterans Irene
Pappas. as the discarded queen.
Catherine, and Anthony Quayle,
as Cardinal Woolsey. and new-
comer William Squire as Sir
Thomas More are superior, but
John Colicas as Cromwell is
nothing short of sensational. The
hate he arouses in the audience is
reminiscent of Robert Ryan's por-
trayal of Claggart in Peter
Ustinov's Billy Budd.

Technically ANNE OF THE
THOUSAND DAYS is undistin-
guished. Director Charles Tarrot
seems rather undecided what to
do. His style runs the gamut from
free and careless to tight and
unimaginative. There are some
beautifully lyric shots of Henry
and Anne horseback riding. and

Catherine’s entrance into the
papal inquisitions is extremely
'well handled and very moving.
Perhaps the only really bad se-
quences is Anne’s soliloquy in the
Tower of London. This portion of
the film not only explains every-
thing away but comes off triter
and is wholly unbelievable.
Keeping with the modern trend,
ANNE OF THE THOUSAND

DAYS is of course, too long. The
superfluous length of ANNE hurts
its effectiveness a great deal.
ANNE OF THE THOUSAND
DAYS could have been a fine film
but because it is dragged out so
much at the end it loses a great
deal of its power. What could have
been a sensitive and moving con-
clusion is only a watered down
outcome.

Final Band Concert -
Electronic Music Soon

When the last sounds of Bern-
stein's Overture lo Candide fade
away on May 8. an era of music at
Albany State will end. Mr. William
Hudson. director of the University
Concert Band will be conducting
the group for the last time here in
Albany. In September he will as—
sume his new position as conduct-
or of the symphony orchestra and
operii at the University of Mary-
land.

It would be very difficult to as-
sess the contribution that Mr.
Hudson has made to the expand-
ing music department and specifi-
cally to the band in the seven
short years he has been in Albany.
When he arrived in 1963. the em-
bryonic band consisted of about
20 “beginning” players. Concerts
at other colleges or area high
schools were not even considered.
and a tour was a dream for the
most idealistic. The concerts per—
formed here ut State were medio-
cre. as attendance showed.

Today. however, the situation
has changed dramatically. The
band now plays 2 or 3 high school
concerts each semsestcr; it per-
forms 2 main concerts in the Per
forming Arts Center each semes—
ter; and in 1969. the band spon-
sored its first annual benefit con-
cert. Thrce years ago the band
performed at Montreal's Expo ‘67
and was very enthusiastically re<
ceivcd. One last credit to the or-
ganization has been a recent invi-
tation to participate in an inter-
national music competition in
London. England in August of
1971. All these achievements are
the culmination of Mr. Hudson's

competence, diligence. and artistic
proficiency as a conductor and a
musician.

The University Concert Band is
the result of the work of Mr. Hud-
son. He has built up a tremendous
rapport with the band members
which has 6 veloped into their
great admiration and respect for
him. They are willing to put forth
that little extra essence that insure
the success of a concert.

It is very difficult to describe
the effect that Mr. Hudson has
had on the band. Your last oppor-
tunity to experience it will be at

erating and processing equipment
are making possible. Among the
composers whose work will be
presented during the festival are:
Milton Biibbit. Mario Duvidovsky.

Rock

of All Ages - A

Beatles Retrospective

by Allyne Jacob
Sarge/i1 Pepper

A majority of the songs on this
album deal with the themes of
loneliness getting older. ap-
proaching death. Lucy in the Sky
with Diamonds is an early psyche-
delic song. When Lennon was told
the initials of the first letters of
the main words in the title were
l.s.d. he claimed ignorance and
said that when his son Julian came
home from school one day he had
drawn a picture of a person in the
air with diamonds all round;
Lennon said that he decided to
call it Lucy...ctc. This may be true
but there seems to be more to the
song than simply child-like inno-
cence. It appears as though
Lennon uan McCartney iirc taking
us on a “trip.” The words are
main clue to this. but also the
music smacks of a surrealism or
meta-realism which one would
feel if he were either sleeping or
‘tripping." What may be seen in
this case is an inquiry into the
‘unreality of reality." "News
paper taxis" refer to a marijuana
"trip" (if the stuff is laced with
something potent). which can be
rolled in newspaper. The use of
certain dcsi'riplch words aids in
the song add to the vividnoss.
People having luken “acid” often
say that their experience has been
vivid. The only movement in the
song is that of the “you” and
"Lucy." Could this be saying
something uboul the upulhy in llll'
World? As i mention. use of the
ailjcctivos may suggest the on
reality of things.

ll’illiin You Without You is it
composition by Harrison. The
title has ll dual meaning to it: life
flows on inside of your and out-
side of yourself but more it flows
within you and without you.
People iirc living lives of self
delusion. fooling themselves until
death. and then it is too late. No
one can change you but you. You
are very small in the world but

still you can do important things
with yourself. It is up to you. The
fact that some people forget their
ideals. the ability and desire to
forgive. the genuine acceptance of
the other people. giving but not
expecting returns. the warmth of
feeling uninhibited by “games.”

People who gain the world and
lost their “souls” may refer to the
base socialism of our world. they
may gain the material but lose the
spiritual when they can not see
and know love (of giving) the love
has gone cold and the world is the
way it is. When you realize that
others are important. and you are
merely a purl but an integral one.
then you may just may fine
“Peace of mind."

'Wc're all one" means simply
lhnl when one hurts his fellow
man he hurts himself, that is hurts
the World and its chances of be-
coming a better place in which to
live.

U N Ir Q N N I’ i 4! ﬂ

ll’lienl'm Sixty-Four deals with
the idea of loneliness and the
coming of old age. The person
speaking is much younger than
sixty-four but is concerned about
his future: he wants to he needed
and loved but why should he
worry about it now. Are the
Beatles saying that with the way
the world is now with the empha-
sis on youth iind staying young
and with the serious slate lhiil the
young are forced to think about
the future and how to live. with
the mass media. and youth know
so much more than the prior
generation did that they may be
old "Mature" before their time?
The Isle of Milli is off the coast of
England and is ll haven for those
who are retired “Dear” means
expensive. The song may also be
talking about the idea of the
nation committing itself to ll
planned future. the boy is asking

the girl about their definite
arrangements for many years
hence.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

by Bob Rosenblum

According to Nat Hentol’f in his
book The Jazz Life the degrading
public comments and attitudes
concerning jazz affected Blacks.
Blacks began to think that their
personal art form was indeed
something to be ashamed of. Al-
though some White institutions
now include courses on jazz. no
Black Institutions permit it. When
a new weekly Harlem paper was
having a discussion of policy the
editor “suggested that the paper
give the music and musicians wide
coverage in coy mat to the avoid-
nacc of jazz by most of the Negro
press." According to the editor.
“Nearly all the other staff mem-
bers opposed giving jazz more
than ii little space even though
everyone spent at least one week
in a jazz club and collected
records. They didn't think jazz
was ‘respectiiblc' enouin

The most interesting part of
I-Ientoff's book is the chapter
called “The Apprenticeship and
Accounting." Jazz musicians
rarely get the backing from unions
that other musicians do. Most of
the clubs where jazz is played pay
extremely low salaries. Jazz is
further hampered by policemen
who threaten to have a place
closed if a club permits couples of
two races to come together. A
policeman simply takes the bar of
soup out of the men's room and
the club cannot pass inspection
laws. Because jazz is not permit-
ted in many of the better sections
they usually have to pay off
policemen to gel. the protection

The recording business has been
unkind to jazz musicians. Many of
them have no legal knowledge and
are taken advantage of by record-
ing companies. They often run
into debt merely by being charged
with “promotional costs" and are
forced to continually record with
the same company to get out of
debt

Jazz musicians also have much
trouble directly with the police as
well as indirectly through clubs.
Thclonius Monk. a brilliant artist
and recognized as such both in
and out of the jazz world. was
once arrested for being suspected
of using narcotics and had his
police curd taken away from him
and was not permitted to play in
clubs for two years. lt.hurt his
career irrepariibly. However. he
was never proven guilty and nar-
cotics were not found on him.

Oflcn strong arm men help as-
sign jiizz musiCiuns to record com-
panies. The following is directly
from Ilcntoff's book "One owner
assigned a body guard to a vocalist
who wanted to leave his club and
his record company. “Be a nice
sweet girl. sweetie." he soothed
her "or I‘ll break youriirm.”

Of course the salaries paid to the
artists are related only to his
commercial merits and not his
artistic importance. This is ex-
peciiilly sad because it causes artis-

commercial records or to barely

Knowledge of jazz ls almost
non—existent in high school. When
bassist Charlie Mingus was of high
.school age they Were about to
send him to a special school for
slow learners until they found his

through school he took music
lessons and was constantly dis-
couraged by teachers who told
him to give up. They could not
comprehend his jazz inﬂuence. He
later became a musician and com-
poser and was eventually recog-
nized as such by academic musi’
cians as well as jazz musicians.
