NEW 4 HA VEN-

by lack Schwartz
an ASP Feature

 

 

 

Solidarity, a People's army, a new American
Revolution. May day in New Haven was the begin-
ning of a new offensive; against war, against fascism,
against racism. We were all brothers and sisters.

Early Friday evening, we decided to meet “the
enemy." Walking from the Green to the gymnasium,
passing jeeps, trucks, pigs and soldiers, lines of
National Guardsmen encountered the New Left.
Many joked openly, others saw us as commie-pinko
-wierdos. I spoke to one young soldier, (whose name
and address he has asked me to withhold for fear of
court martial), a 26 year old kid from Lower Man-
hattan. Five months remained of his six years of
bondage, and when I asked him what he was going
to do after his release, he said “I'm gonna grow my
hair to my ass, and my heard to my belly button,
I’m gonna be one of you!" This made me feel a
sense of progress to reach even the censored minds
of the military. .

Others expressed plans of keeping their weapons,
to use against the government, for they felt that
non-violence had failed to produce any viable
change.

Later that night, Jerry Rubin spoke to hundreds
inside Branford College, on the old campus of Yale.
A Black man, claiming to he a Panther, said that
these Panthers had been busted on the Green, and
he said that support was needed. Rubin countered
with a plea for calm. About two hundred people
movad off campus, and were repelled by rolling
clouds of tear gas that engulfed the entire down~
town area.

I later realized the reason for a leaﬂet that had
been handed out during Jerry‘s talk, it was a map of
corporate and governmental offices, with suggestive
symbols of arson—an invitation to walk into the
hands of the troops. Students returning from the
melee reported that “short-haired men" started the
rock and bottle attack on the police.

We returned to Branford, and found a labyrinth
beneath the buildings. Bodies were wrapped around
mattresses, chairs, and the floor; weary protestors
were recovering from a long day. ’I‘hoae of us who
could still run around, began to search for food. The
scene looked like the hideout of an army, re-gather-
ing pulsating communal life from the campus.

A few refrigerators were ripped off, and an un~
named person and his companion stumbled upon a
cache of Civil Defense C-rations. After opening the
door, the word was passed that food was available,
and throngs of the hungry grabbed cans of food.
The only problem was, there were no can openers.
If we ever have a national disaster, and you're in a
fallout shelter, bring a can opener!

Huge tins ﬂew across the room, into walls, across
pillars. People sat on them, played music on them,
and eventually feasted on millions of what appeared
to be re-constituted dog shit molded into cracker
form.

From there we moved to the Arts and Architec-

ture building, the nerve center of the weekend

which looked more like a crash pad for hippies. In-
gles Rink was reportedly bombed by “right-wing
vigilantes" during a rock concert, and the marshals
closely guarded their headquarters. By 2:30 am. we
stumbled into the Freshmen dorms, and a brother
gave us his roommates’ beds, since they had left
town the day before.

They never knew what they missed.

Saturday morning, we could no longer eat brown
rice and familia, so we found an off-campus diner.
Over eggs and toast we could hear the typical rav-
ings of the local elders. “Commies,” “faggots,”
"chickens," and “the right is right” embellished our
digestion. Then one guy said he saw the bombings
but burning the entire campus Would have been bet-
ter. It was like being behind the lines in a war zone.

We moved to a first aid station from there, so that
my friend Bob could get some help for his sore feet,
and a reported from the New York Times was sit-
ting there snorting. After I pleasantly told him what
a fuckin‘ distorted piece of shit his paper was, for
some reason he escaped out into the streets, seeking
the straight world.

The afternoon was filled with speakers and leaﬂets
condemning the previous night's violence. What I
got out of the information was that the Black Pan-
ther who began the march was really a pig. Nixon
would love to see a riot, on excuse to destroy us
with his Army, Navy, Marines and National Guard.
The government tried to provoke us by kidnapping
18 Panthers in Baltimore Thursday, on ridiculous
charges. They had the press play up the “state of
armed seige" supposedly existing in New Haven, and
when that didn't work, they sent provacateurs into
the crowds.

The Panthers felt that we should only fight on our
terms, when we have a chance to win. Bob and I
went to a workshop to plan the present nationwide
school strike, and then continued on to the second
rally.

Using ridiculous stories, we got into the press
section and while blowing dope and relaxing, we
listened to a Donovan record. Overhead a plane
formed a peace symbol in the blue sky, but was
quickly interrupted by the sight of an Army heli-
copier.

The ﬁrst speaker was Doug Miranda, Defense Cap-
tain of the New Haven Panthers. Ina loud demand-
ing voice he assailed the pig agents who were incit-
ing violence, the kids who thought that the revolu-
tion was a game, and those chauvinists who were
not working to prevent a race war. He said that to
make the revolution, we must have organization and
discipline, to strike at the right time. All Power to
the good shooters.

Jerry Rubin also spoke, screaming of the New Nir-
tion we were building when we close down the High
School and college prisons of Amerika. “Amerikii

Students

Opposed

To Violent Tactics

The following statement was dis-
tributed to students and news
media this morning following last
night's activities.

“We believe that the majority of
students at SUNYA are opposed
to President Nixon’s war in Indo-
China, but are just as opposed to
the tactics employed by an un-
representative minority in the li-
brary last night. Throwing books
on the floor does not end the kill-
ing in Southeast; Asia, nor does it
obtain justice for Bobby Seale.

While we support the goals of
the nation wide strike, we believe
that the local strike leaders and
their methods are reminiscent of
Hitler's Germany and Orwell‘s

‘1984', and serve only to alienate
the University community.

Therefore we appeal to your
conscience, asking you not to par-
ticipate in any form of violence,
and advocate the following alter-
natives:

1) To support the nation
wide strike of classes May 5 in
a non-violent manner.

2) To bring the issues of the
strike off-campus by working
on grassroots political camp-
aigns in 1970.

3) Petitioning for the imme-
diate repeal of the Gulf of
Tonkin Resolution and to call
upon Congress to end all ap-
propriations for the war.

junction prohibiting such rallies is
still in effect.

At New Paltz, 1500 students
were occupying the Adminis-
tration Building. Five hundred
students milled about outside.
Students will strike today.

Locally, RPI students will meet
at 8:00 am this morning to discuss
the strike. There has been no for-
mal strike call but most students
are expected to boycott classes.

Union was shut down by Its ad-
ministration. Seminars will be
held in the morning, canvassing

Skidmore students are also pre-
paring to strike. A massive action
is planned for Wednesday.

Siena held “rap sessions" last
night and it appears that either a
strike or a teach-in would be held

the afternoon.
Services" are also

day.

As the unrest turned to violence
and culminated in death at Kent
State, the White House issued a
statement. “When dissent turns to
violence, it incites tragedy," Pres-
ident Nixon said.

Campus Strike Urged
By Afternoon Rally

Continued from page I

Blacks and whites must “close
this university down," Jackson as-
serted. ‘Liberate your classrooms
and have education."

Jackson warned against getting
“hung-up on death." A revolu-
tionary has to have the spirit to
live. He emphasized the serious
nature of the strike--“lt is not it
froe-for-iill."

“No more classes, no more
school until the shit stops and the
government changes," he shouted.

the people!‘ The words are criti-
cal. As Jackson ended with the

warning: “You better believe
them or you’re killing people."
Several students informally

spoke to the crowd following the
three scheduled speakers.

Jackson introduced one girl who
reﬂected “a different point of
View." She stated that who didn't
believe that anyone had the right
to close down the university or to
insist that students who do not
strike irrc condoning Nixon.

"I do not condone Nixon iind
I'm not going to join your strike."
Nixon shows no signs of listening"

She reaffirmed her belief in the
futility of the act despite shouts
from parts of the audionce. “I
don't see wliiit a strike will accom-
plish."

Jackson countered licr argue
merits with his stand that “the
strike is only part of the strategy
to stop the influx into the abor-
tion.

Another student stated that the
strike min not. be an answcr but
“if you don't do something,
you‘re condoning this war."

’l‘cntativv plans for ii "march
through Albany" were also
announced.

Top Association Officials Elected
In “Confusing” Council Session

by Ken Stokem and Bob Warner

Dave Neiifeld and Dick Wesley
were elected President and Vice-
President respectively of Student
Association on Sunday night by
Central Council.

Neufeld ran unopposed; others,
however were nominated, but de-
clined.

There was a move however, by
Jeff Wasserman to postpone elec-
tions of SA officers until the new
Constitution was passed, since the
pre‘teht "electoral system' is un-
democratic and unrepresentativc
of the student body. He also sug-
gested that an Interim or Acting

The election for Vice president
was more drawn out with two
candidates running- Dick Wesley,
a junior, and Mike Lampert, a
freshman. Both candidates were
questioned individually on their
political philosophy and con-
ception of the office of vice
-president.

The tabulation was as follows:
Wesley-14, Lampert-4, Abstain-Z.

Then Lampert moved that the
Secretary cast a “white ballot"
which is wholehearted and unani-
mous consent of Council.

Last night, however, Pres. Neu—
feld read Wesley's resignation.
Wesley said he had to resign due
to other commitments.

Therefore, nominations were re-
opened for Vice-President. The
nominees were Joe Kaiser and
Mike Lampert. The tabulations on
the first two ballots were Kaiser
10, Lampert 7, and 1 abstention.

After the second ballot Kaiser
withdrew. Then Lampert with-
drew. Therefore nominations were
re-opened. Lampert was nomi-
nated and he accepted. The vote
on the third ballot was 14-3—1 in
favor of the nominee.

GSPA Protests

. 

Building Changes

As a result of the university 's de-
cision to convert Sayler and Pierce
to dormotori'ra the following'pe-
tition is being circulated by mem-
bers of the Graduate School of
Public Affairs.

It is ' g ’ ‘ ,' clear
that it is the intention of the
SUNYA Administration to ignore
and override the educational
needs, interests, and desires of the
Graduate School of Public ‘Affairs
in the matter of the proposed
moving of GSPA to quarters in
Draper Hall.

It is already become clear to the
members of the Graduate School
that the proposed move can have
only the most damaging educa-
tional consequences for the
School and its Departments.

The J ', " L of the
GSPA therefore urge the SUNYA
Administration to reconsider its
plans to uproot the Graduate
School for the following reasons:

(1). The Graduate School of
Public Affairs is already too re-
moved physically from research
facilities, undergraduate class-
rooms, other departments, and
the heart of University life. Fur-
ther physical distance will trans-
late psychologically, and put us
even further out of touch with
colleagues and students.

(2). The proposed arrangements
at Draper Hall, in that they in-

volve sharing of facilities with Al-
bany High School, will have the
disastrous effect of forcing the
Graduate School into late sche-
duling, thereby taming GSPA into
a “mere night school.”

(3). The physical and psycholo-
gical distance of Draper Hall, the
,_ L‘ which will inevitable
arise from the presence of high
school pupils, the clients of the
several clinics housed 'closeby, and
the various administrative staffs
operating out of Draper, will so
deteriorate the scholarly and col-
legial environment that only disin-
tegration at many levels can be an-
ticipated.

We, the undersigned members of
the Graduate School of Public Af-
fairs resent the inferior status
which is implied in the Admin-
istration's easy willingness to solve
l' ' , space r L' at only
our expense. We therefore urge
the Administration to act im-
mediately on this petition and in
consideration of all our other or-
derly and routine efforts in this
matter. Should the Administra-
tion fail to do so in a reasonable
time we can take it as no other
than an indication that we must
turn our attention to more po~
tentially effective means for RE-
SISTING this assault on the fra-
gile and delicate educational and
institutional gains which the
GSPA has made in the past few
years.
