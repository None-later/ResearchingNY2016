Memorial Service

Mourns Kent State Deaths

An audience of over one
thousand attended a memorial
service for the four students killed
at Kent State University on
Monday. A number of faculty
members and some students
briefly addressed the audience in
the Campus Center gardens.

Short readings from Becket‘s
"Waiting for Godot" and some
poetry opened the service. Fol-
lowing this, Father Paul Smith
offered a short prayer for the
Kent students.

John Kaufman spoke of some
of his experiences in Madison,
Wisconsin and his own reactions
to the news of the Kent State
deaths. He called for violent
revolution to end the kind of
oppression demonstrated by the
actions in Ohio.

Dean 0. William Perlmutter of
the College of Arts and Sciences
opened his speech with the
statement that he was personally
involved with Kent State and had
been in contact with Ohio all
Monday night and Tuesday
morning. As a result of his
experience both with Kent and
Albany. he pointed out certain
similarities between the two, al-
though ha said that Albany was
"five years behind Kent."

Perlmutter called for com-
munity action and for bringing
education to Albany. This would
fulfill the true function of the
University, he held.

Following his speech, he re-
ceived a standing ovation from the
crowd. One student, however,
apparently unclear about
Perlrnutter's meaning, asked] if
Perlmutter supported the strike.
Dean Perlmuttor emphatically an-
swered yes.

Following Perlmuttur's ro-
marks, an Italian professor spoke.
He told the crowd that he had

an alien for 10 years but

would file for citizenship on
Wednesday, since only as a citizen
could he have the right to protest.

The rest of the speakers expres-
sed a common guilt; no one in
America is guiltless for the death
of the Kent students. The con-
cern, however. was for the livinu
not the dead.

A short explanation of
the problem of lowering the flag
to half mast was offerred. Permis~
sion had to be obtained through
the Governor‘s office, which had
been contacted by a group of
studenfs. Students gathered
around the flagpoles after the
memorial service.

Clarification Statement

The following is a statement by
Victor Looper, Student Associa-
tion Vice-President: '

it is extremely unfortunate that
my statement of May 6th on the
channel 0 6:00 News was taken
out of context. The intent of we
students that went to the TV
station was to inform people that
we were opposed to the recent
deaths and acts of violence which
have shocked the conscience of a
large majority of students on cam-
pus. We were spacifically opposed
to last night's property destruc-
tion and violence which could
have resulted in serious injury or

worse.

The opening remarks of the
commentator indicated that some
students were opposed to the
demonstrations despite recent oc—
currences. I was then the next one
to speak, the implication being
that I was one of those who op-
posed the demonstrations. 'I‘he.
commentator's statement was
completely misleading. I am not
opposed to non-violent (lemon-
strations nor am I opposed to a
strike as an effective method of
indicating disapproval of the war,
oppression, and injustices of the
Nixon Administration.

SA Leaders Ask ‘
For Non -Violence

With the current strike on campus and with the growing strife
among campuses throughout the nation one must consider the

hr 1, background of this movement and in that context view the present. In

that light we shall attempt-to show Student Association’s current

involvement and view of the matter.

The people of this country have been plagued by many inconsis-
tencies, hypocrices, and insults. We are told to respect law and order

—‘ but are forced to accept the reality of the Chicago trial and ofa wru-

which is blatantly unconsitutional. We were told that 1 60,000 troops
would be withdrawn and that draft calls would decrease, yet we are
faced with growing involvement in Cambodia, with no end of the win
in sight. We are told that racism does not exist yet in the State of New
York thousands of Blacks are unemployed while thousands of while
out of state residents are imported into New York to fill the growing
job demands in the construction industry. We have only to look at the
manner in which Bobby Scale and other Blacks have been treated in
the courts, in the schools, and in so many aspects of American life. We
are told that dissent is our right and that violence must not be con-
doned. Yet one has only to look at the Chicago convention, Indo-

china, and Kent State University.

It is because of much of the above that a national campus strike
was called for at New Haven this past weekend. Last Monday Central
Council met to consider the growing strike on campus and endorsed

the National Strike Committee's demands. Council also appropriated
$300 to cover the strike committee's expenses, and since, Student
Association has given over $550 additional and an office in support of

this cause.

Last night many people became aware of the possibility of violence
on campus. An attempt was made to set the administration building
on fire, and one on Colonial Quad caused two student injuries. We
must remember that if such incidents continue, it will not be long
before we face the scene of a senseless death on this campus. ll‘
violence ﬂares up and student lives are endangered, Student Associa-
tion may wish to seek legal action to close the school. As one remem-
bers the loss of life in Indochina and at Kent State and of so many
Blacks, one sees the true horror of Death. We. cannot and must not let
ourselves become violent and add to the dead. We must use all the
tools of non-violence such as the boycotting of corporations, the tying
up of the bureaucracies, and even other means of non—violent civil
disobedience. But we cannot become a party to the violence which
could precipitate the death of one human being.

ann Egrlmutter:

Just Stop

by Joe Stringer

“Dean Perimutter, what is the
state of the campus now?"

“That is exactly what I’m
trying to find out."

Dean Perlmutter appeared in
the Campus Center late last night,
talking with kids and listening:
mainly listening to what they had
to say about the campus, the
strike, and the day '5 events.

An ASP reporter interviewed
the Dean shortly as to events of
the day. Perlmutter made clear
what the Administration had been
doing: during the afternoon the
Administration had polled
groups-Faculty Senate, Central
Council--about closing down the
campus and had concluded that
this should be done. However,
Perlmutter explained, only the
Trustees could legally close the
university and if appeared that
they were waiting to see what

and Think

would happen last night and
today. So, the university is still
open.

As he saw it, the whole sludenl
body was in a state of disorginn
zation, except for the one organi-
zation, that of the strike cnmnnl
tee. Perlinutter felt that ihu
majority of students still have not
indicated their stand on the Sirlkf'
The greatest need was for sllKlf'llln
to organize and ascertain llll'
majority student opinion.

"They must work this thing out
themselves; the teachers can't
organize for them; they have to
organize themselves."

Perlmutter seemed dismayed on
learning that many students were
going home, although be under
stood their fears.

The most important thing, he
thoughl, is for kids to selth- down
and think things out realistically.
This advice seems lo be [he bcsl

THURSDAY, MAY '7, 1970

Washington, D.C.-CPS-’I‘he
nationwide student anti-war
strike, now including OVer 339
schools, continues to mushroom
into the largest anti-government
protest in the nation's history.

In California, Governor Ronald
Reagan has ordered all schools in
that state's university system to
close for at least the weekend.
Strikes on campuses there report
70% effectiveness and, at
Berkeley, about 17,000 people
rallied against government pol-
icies.

Governor James Rhodes of
Ohio has ordered that all colleges
and universities that show signs of
dissent or possible violence should
be closed down immediately.

Over 4,000 National Guard
troops were ordered onto the Uni-
versity of Kentucky campus fol-
lowing the burning of the ROTC
building there.

Other schools whose ROTC
facilities have been either attacked
or destroyed include University of
Nebraska, Western Illinois Univer-
sity, Central Michigan University,
University of Virginia and Case

Anti- War

Western Reserve University.

National Guard has been called
to the University of Wisconsin at
Madison and the University of
Illinois.

Internationally, the student left
has mobilized for mass protest
action in Sweden, France, Italy
and Belgium calling for rallies Sat-
urday to express their solidarity
with U.S. students.

In Saigon, all high schools and
universities have been closed
because of student rioting, Pres
ident Thieu announced yesterday.

A march on Washington heads
the list of planned strike activities
here. Ron Young, director of New
Mobe to End the War, has
announced that the march,
scheduled for Saturday, will pro-
ceed in front of the White House
and will definitely go on without
a permit.

The Justice Department has
asked for a permit waiver for a
demonstration on Washington
monument grounds, however, the
New Mobe has rejected that alter~
native.

Special ' Meeting

C

An emergency meeting of the
faculty to consider their role in
the university strike will be held
today at noon. The faculty mem-
bers will be asked to articulate a
stand on the issues behind the
strike.

The meeting, which will be held
in the Campus Center Ballroom
has been called by a group of
faculty convened by President
Kuusiston. The President charged
the group to implement his state-
ment of yesterday in the way
most valuable to the student com-
munity.

The group decided to form it-
self info a steering committee in
order to plan the agenda of the
emergency meeting. The steering
group hopes that the faculty will
formally recognize the inability of
the University to continue its con-
ventional operations. It is ex-
pected that the faculty will stage a
protest action to redeﬁne the con-
cerns of the University.

The faculty would, in this act-
ion, support the student strike
and its aims. It is believed that the
professors will be asked to protest
against the violence and coertion
of the government. The protest
would be pointed toward the mis-

The coordinating group did its

to the faculty with the assump-

should act together in the Univer-

proposed agenda for today's meet-
ing, the faculty planners worked
with students.

Among the proposals that will
be presented to the faculty in the
ballroom today is one asking for
University facilities to remain
open for full and free discussions
of matters relating to the critical
role the University should play in
our present society. Faculty mem-
bers will be asked, however, to
help students who wish to grim;
pressing academic obligations.

The faculty will also be asked
to send telegrams to President
Nixon and Governor Rockefeller.
The Nixon telegram is expected
to protest the troop involvement
in Cambodia and Vietnam. It is
believed the telegram to
Rockefeller will confirm the fac-
ulty's solidarity with the strike.
