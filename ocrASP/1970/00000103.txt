Zeross New York State

by Bob Warner

Buffalo—The strike has been
highly effective. A thousand stu-
dents marched down Main Street
at noon Tuesday. By the time the
group reached its destination, it
had doubled in size. The students
blocked traffic for a time, and
then proceeded to march, break-
ing some bank windows along the
way. Eight blocks away, the group
of students noticed police massing
so they tried to barricade Main
Street. Obstacles were thrown at
the police. Telephone poles
caught fire. The incident lasted
about half an hour. The students
returned to the campus, setting up
roadblocks between themselves
and the police. Students then
tried to return to a downtown
Buffalo highschool, stoning the
police simultaneously. The police
responded with at least 10 can-
nisters of tear gas. The wind.
which blew toward the students,
worsened the gas‘s effect. After
that, a smaller group of students
went back to Main Street, only to
be bombarded with more gas.
Students regrouped on campus as
the police took up posts directly
across the street, frequently lob-
bing cannisters of tear gas on to
the Univeristy property. The
police never actually set foot in
the campus. it is reported that at
one time 21 cannisters of gas
exploded on campus within 5

Vandalism Arrests Forseen

it is certain that SUNYA
students implicated in the de-
facing of campus pillars earlier in
the week and in the library
vandalism of last Monday night
will be arrested. The only reason
arrests have not yet been made is
because campus security is gather-
ing enough evidence to assure a
court conviction. As of this
writing, no arrests have been made
in regard to either incident.

Nevertheless, arrests arising out
of the library incidents, in which
windows were broken and books
were scattered throughout the
second floor of the library, will
occur very shortly. A few students
have definitely been identified in
having played a part in the
disturbance.

As for the defacing of the
pillars, no immediate arrests are
expected; the case is still under
continuing investigation. Security
is attempting to expand the
investigation to include other
incidents of property defacement
on the campus. They are not
concerned solely with the deface-
ment that occurred last Saturday
night.

At that time, a security police-
man witnessed students spraying
paint on the pillars. He did not
formally make arrests, but “in-
vited“ them to go to the security
building. There they were asked
to hand their ID cards over for
identification purposes (they have
since been returned). They were
not arrested.

chief of campus security, admit-

ted taking moving pictures at the

  

Tuesday afternoon confrontation
at the ﬂagpole, where students
attempted to lower the flag to
half mast. He claimed the taking
of pictures was in keeping with
standard security procedure. He
stated that pictures are often
taken of people, accidents, and
damage (such as the Colonial
Quad fire-bombing).

However, he did admit that
procedures have become “more
elaborate"-~ especially within the
past few days. Still pictures have
been replaced with an $800
motion picture camera.

Connolly denied that security
has any kind of main storage file
of photographs, which con-
ceivably could be used to help in
identifying certain segments of
the university community. He did
state that photographic evidence

seconds. At the scene of the
confrontation, 160 police were
dressed in full riot gear and gas
masks. That night, there were
more incidents. police using spot-
lights to locate groups of students
and then lobbing tear gas into the
crowds. This continued through-
out the night. University president
Regen requested the police to
stop using the gas, but the chief of
police refused. Quiet returned to
the campus Wednesday morning.

'Late last night, it was reported
that 40 to 50 Buffalo city high
school students are attacking
students on campus who are con-
fronting police. The high school
students are armed with zip guns,
knives, and rocks. Their aim is to
help police and ‘kill hippies'.

Stony Brook—A barn was burn-
ed and small fires were set at the
Humanities and Social Sciences
buildings, a dorm under construc-
tion, and some snack bars. No
serious damage occurred, how-
ever. Wednesday's activites in-
cluded a march on a shopping
center and a federal building.

arpur—Strike was called for at
Harpur beginning today. Faculty
support for the strike was over-
whelming (3:1). Students will
distribute leaﬂets in the commun-
ity tomorrow. Classes are suspend~
ed indefinitely.

Students have the choice of
accepting a ‘pass' grade, nn incom-
plate, or their present grade in the
course. There is a huge demon-
stration in downtown Binghamton
Saturday; students are planning

to surround the courthouse.

Queens College—On Tuesday,
about 1,000 students marched to
the Flushing draft board. On the
way, about 300 stopped traffic on
the Long island Expressway for
twenty minutes. chcn or eight
police cars broke up the blockade;
there was no violence. At a rally
that night, the students voted to
strike indefinitely. The strike has
been very effective with class
attendance reported as very low.

CCNY—About 1500 students
marched around the North Cam-
pus and disrupted classes Tuesday.
The school was closed yesterday
and today. A small group of
students ransacked an ROTC
supply building. William Kunstler,
lawyer for the Chicage B, and
Jerry Lefcourt, lawyer for the
New York Panther 22, marched in
a rally from Columbia to CCNY.
Approximately 150 students re-
mained overnight. Wednesday was
very peaceful. About 200 students
participated in workshops. The
Faculty Senate will meet today to
decide whether or not to cancel]
classes for the rest of the term.

Brooklyn College—Students
took over a few administration
buildings. The strike is planned to
last the remainder of the semester.
Classes were held yesterday.

NYU—ClaSses were suspended
yesterday; further action is uncer-
tain.

Princeton—320 students turned

in their draft cards, but later
decided that their action was
merely symbolic and therefore
futile. Princeton is attempting to
set up a National Draft Collo-
quium.
Columbia-The strike is very
successful. There is a moratorium
on classes, but the University is
offically open. A city-wide rally
was held at Columbia yesterday at
11 pm.

University of Rochester—The
school was closed yesterday, not
necessarily because of the strike,
but rather because of a traditional
“niVL’TSlly holiday. Students
occupied the administration
building from Monday night until
Tuesday afternoon. Rochester is
spearheading a massive petition
campaign in protest of the war in
indo-China. The goal is 20
million signatures. To collect
money for a nation-wide anti—war
PUDliCity campaign. each signer
was asked to donate fifty cents.
So far, 8000 names and $4,000
has been collected.

Faculty Suspends
Mandatory Classes

by Barry Kirschner

The faculty of SUNYA passed a
resolution, suspending mandatory
class schedules for the remainder
of the semester, and attempting to
prevent the penallzation of stu-
dents for non-attendance on Fri-
day, May 8. The preamble to this
resolution asked President Nixon
to “end the war, to end injustice
at home, to listen to the voices of
protest, to act to unite the coun-
try." it also expressed support for
the student protest.

This resolution was the less rudi-
cal of two proposals before the
faculty. The other proposal in its
prean‘iblc, harshly criticized the
government for extending the
"callous" war in Vietnam to Cain-
bodia, the use of force to police
college campuses, and the use of
the legal system to repressBlack
dissident and youth groups. im-
plementation of a policy for class-
cs for the remainder of the semes-
ter was virtually the same in each
resolution.

The resolution states:

l. The mandatory class sche-
dules for students and faculty
shall not be maintained for the
remainder of the semester.

2. That students shall be assisted
in meeting any pressing academic
obligations. Under no conditions
will a student be penalized for
failure to attend classes. Students
shall have the option of

a. fulfilling the course work nor
mally required

b. accepting an incomplete

c. accepting the present grade as
final

d. students and faculty to agree

 

mutually upon the completion of
course work

e. accepting a pass/no credit
grade for this semester.

3. That the Campus facilities
shall remain available for all full
and free discussion of matters
relating to the critical role that
the University should play in so-
ciety, as well as for normal Uni-
versity functioning.

4. That every effort be made to

Strike

by Barry Kirschner

Approximately 3,000 supporters
of the student strike effectively
closed the Federal Building and
the adjacent Post Ofﬁce Tuesday
for six hours in a massive action
of non-violent civil disobedience.
The demonstrators, almost entire-
ly students, linked arms in front
of doorways and refused to let
employees enter the building.
Those inside the buildings, how-
ever, were permitted to leaVe.

This action was taken by the
Strike Committee at SUNYA and
was supported by representatives
of various schools, some faculty,
and other concerned citizens. The
purpose of the action was to stop
the federal government from
operating “business as usual," and
to support the demands of the
nationwide student protest.

The demonstrators were well-
behaved and initiated no violence,
as they had promised. Although
one bricf scuffle (lid develop whilc
workers in the area were on their
lunch break, this involved only a
handful of people and no one was
hurt. The demonstrators policed
themselves effectively with chants
of “stay on the sidewalk," and
marhsals did an excellent job in
maintaining order. Albany police
also helped prevent incidents dur-
ing the tense noon hour.

The protest began before 7:30
a.m., early enough to prevent the
normal induction procedures of
the Selective Service department,
housed in the federal building.
Throughout the morning demon-
strators refused to allow people to
enter the building, linking arms in
order to carry out their mission
non-violently. in addition to the
blockage of doorways, driveways
were also blocked, preventing
trucks to follow through with
“business as usual" with the fed-
eral government.

The mood of the crowd was
serious throughout the day.
Chants of “Free Bobby Scale,"
and “Peace Now" greeted passers-
by in the area. For the most part
the demonstrators were friendly,

r

\_ .,..

“i beg to disagree."

  

  

talking with spectators across one
street and with workers of the
General Services Administration
in the loading dock behind the
building.

Those blocked from entering the
building had varied responses.
When told that “business as usual
is not going to go on today," one
replied, “Where‘s your generosity?
i’m losing a day's pay." Another
said, “Well, I guess I'll go play golf
today."

Throughout the day large num-
bers of people watched the
demonstration from the opposite
side of the street. While some
dialogue was initiated between
student strollers and spectators,
many conversations were reduced
to denunciations of “those com-
munists." The following is an
example of one such discussion:

Sludcnl: We think the war is
senseless.

Spectator: How old are you?

Sindenl: 18.

Sper'lulor: it's about time you
started learning about war first-
hand!

Tension grew as lunch hour
came and went. Rumors speculat-

ing about possible actions of con-
struction workers were wide-
spread, and many feared a recur‘
rence of the vigilante violence
seen in the Wall St. area of New
York City last Friday. Although
one very brief incident did occur,
nobody was hurt, and the dis-
turbance served to reinforce the
determination of protesters and
police to carry on without vio-
lence.

The crowd dispersed at 1:30
p.m., having blocked entrance in~
to the building for 6 hours. Pro-
testers left in an orderly fashion
and followed the identical route
of return used in .last week's
march to the Capitol. This route
consciously avoided a potentially
dangerous confrontation with
constructions workers opposite
the Alfred E. Smith Building on
Washington Ave. This was the
scene of an injury to one coed last
week, hit with an object thrown
from an elevated construction
site.

in the words of a strike leader,
“it's a sad (lily for the marines
Those hippy prc‘verts have turned

But, the consciousness grows!

They came in droves, hundreds upon hundreds, embarking upon
what must have been, for many, their first real contact with civil
disobedience. Nervousness and fear were distinctly present, yet
lightheartedness and giddiness must have been the only moods readily

discernable to an outsider.

They marched down to the city, half asleep at the ungodly hour;
yet, with every step confidence increased, as the number of marchers

grew larger and larger.

The structure came in sight: Albany’s representative of a federal
government which they know was oppressing the blacks, the radicals,
the dissenters. This was the focal point for the frustrations and the

emotions. “Shut it down!"

The doors were manned, the positions taken. The bank's electronic
beacon spat forth: 7:21. The police were visible, unlike the earlier
rally of last week, and visible in numbers. The troops braced

themselves.
