Four Crises:

 

by Barry Klrschner
An ASP Feature
Richard Nixon once authored a
book titled Six Crises and after
listening to over 6 hours of
deadening discussion at 2 faculty
meetings, l felt inspired to write
about 4 crises I observed.
Number l—May ll, l970
Vice President for Academic
Affairs Charles O'Reilly interprets
section 2c of a faculty passed
resolution, which states, “Under
no conditions will a student be
penalized for failure to attend
classes. Students shall have the
option of:

accepting the present grade as
final.

This is interpreted as saying
that the instructor will continue
to have the option of doing what-
ever he or she wants to any
student‘s grades.

Number2

Robert Hoffman of the History
Department proposed a resolution
banning the practice of security
within the university's jurisdic-
tion, photographing gatherings of
people without their permission.

Vice President Olsen then
assured all faculty that photo-

graphs of those assembled in poll-
tical protest were non-existent.
and that there was no file of
photographs whatsoever. This
then occurred:

Question—If what you said is
true, why was Chief of Security
Connolly taking pictures of the
ﬂagpole incident Tuesday, May 4?

Olsen—He was experimenting
with a new camera. We haven’t
even bought it yet. Photographs
are helpful in law enforcement
relating to vandalism in the
parking lot.

Question—If security has taken
pictures, how come there are no
files of photographs in existence?

Olsen—Those pictures probably
aren‘t even developed yet.

Shortly after an exchange like
the one just written of, the
faculty voted to table the
Hoffman Resolution.

Number 3

One of the black sheep in
SUNYA's School of Education
sought to censure a statement of
John Kaufman’s, which dealt with
a list of instructors who appear to
be penalizing non-attending stu-
dents, in spite of the faculty
resolution. He stated that this list
represented a threat, and that
threats did not belong in the
rational atmosphere of the univer-

sitv.

This is the same man who has
informed at least one class that
the final will be mandatory,

For Another Day

or whatever. This is the man wh
peaks to defend instructors wh:
Intimidate students through the
use of grades and mandatory

attendance and who babbles
about the university being no
place for threats.

Number»

A resolution sponsored by
Walter Goldstein called for toler-
ance in dealing with perpetrators
of petty crimes within the last 10
days. This proposal did not in-
clude amnesty for those involved
in arson or fire-bombings.
Goldstein sought to advise the
president to drop criminal charges
against those suspected of petty
vandalism.

Following a passionate appeal
by ‘student representative’ Bob
Iseman against this resolution in
order to protect the property
rights of the taxpayers of New
York State, Dean Morris added a
personal appeal. After seeing press
coverage of the student protest
one of the Dean's children said,
“Mommy, Daddy ought to throw
them out." Morris, obviously
more responsive to his children
than to his students, hinted that
should the Goldstein resolution be
passed he would have to seriously
reevaluate his future in higher
education.

Mauritz Johnson followed with
an eloquent appeal to preserve the
purpose of the university as it
place for open dialogue, by rc-
jccting a "posture of retribution."
The faculty then voted to 2I(l'
journ. leaving the question uni
answered for yet another day.

Faculty Discusses Problems

eliminate the threat of violence or
the use of harassment on our
campus.

5. That the faculty and adminis-
tration shall take the steps to
implement these resolutions.

6. Where students are engaged in
practice teaching, field work, in-
ternships, clinics, and similar
courses which involve other agcn~
cies and where commitments of
the students and the University
are involved, students are asked to
continue without interruption.

The meeting resumed Monday,
May ii, to discover that Vice
President. O'Rcilly's interpretation
of section of the resolution was
far from the intent as voted by
the faculty. This prompted the
passage of a clarifying resolution:

1. That. no student who elects to
accept. option C shall receive the
grade of E or of no credit for any
course in which he has been con-
tinuously enrolled for the Spring
semester of 1970 unless thcrc is
objective evidence which dcmon~
stratus that the student was clear-
ly falling at. the time the strikc
began (Tuesday, May 5, 1970).

2. ’I‘hutanystudcnt who has been
continuously enrolled for the
Spring semester of l970 who rc-
ccivcs the grade of E or of no
credit. in any course shall have the
option of appealing his grade to
the committee on academic stand-
ing of his College or School (cc.

Undergraduate Affairs Committee
of the College of Arts and
Science; Committee on Academic
Standing of the School of Busi‘
ness).

At that time the professor in
question will be required to sub-
mit whatever evidence he has in
support of the grade of E or of no
credit to that committee, and the
student will be asked to present
his evidence of satisfactory work.

3. That any student or faculty
member may request that the
Committee on Academic Standing
of the Undergraduate Academic

'Council review the decision of the

College or School Committee.

Following the passage of this
resolution, Professor Hoffman of
the History Department proposed
that no agency within thc univcr-
sity's govcrnnncc (security) be ill-
lowud to photograph people on
campus without their permission.
He explained how complete the
dossier of the FBI and similar
agencies are with the names of
people involved in political activi-
ty. At this time Vicc President.
Olsen stnlcd bluntly that security
kcpt no files of photographs, but
upon questioning Olscn com-
pletely contradicted himself. The
faculty voted to table Hoffman's
motion,

posed by Walter Goldstein risking

tommunity Interaction Encouraged

by Bob Warner

A group of SUNYA faculty and
concrncd Albany citizens have
formed a Citizens Committee for
University Relations. Professor
Urofsky of the Foundations of
Education Department, the
spokesman for the group, said
that its prime concern is to get the
large group of modcrutcs in the
area to talk with students, mainly
because many people are afraid of
students and do not understand
them.

The group, though min-partisan,
is basically liberal in outlook and
is solidly opposed to the thl'.
Urokay, howcvur, fuels that many

students have been uctingirrutinn-

ally the past few weeks, princi-

pally bccnusc ‘somc of their mu-
thods ndpotcd nrc solf-dcfcnling‘.
Therefore, the committee will
busicnlly appeal to logic.

As a small step in solving the
problem of studcnlrcummunily
relations, the group is asking that
‘nll churches, synagogues, civic
and social groups in this area hpr
institute a dialogue.

The League of Women Voters,
which is noted for its impartiality,
will provide experienced modera-
tors for the forums. Students who
would like to participate in any
dialogue with thc community
should leave his name, address and
phone number in Professor
Urofsky's mailbox (It'll) in the
Education Building.

related activity (e.g. writing on
pillars, the library incident, etc.).
While this motion was being do:
bated a proposal for adjournment
was made and passed, necessiti-
ating yet another faculty meeting
Tuesday. May 12.

Products of the Philip Morris
Company and the Coca Cola Com-
pany have been singled out for a
nationwide boycott in con-
junction with the national student
strike.

Organized by the National Boy-
cott Committee with headquarters
at Brandeis University, the boy-
cott is slated to continue, the
group says, “until the position of
our national government is modi-
fied in accord with the student
strike goals: an end to the war in
lndo-China and greater justice for
minorities at home."

"The only effective means of
protest is peaceful economic boy-
cott," adds the group.

Hendrik van den Berg. a local
coordinator, further explained
that “people are getting tired of
marching around. An economic
boycott of this sort, is simpler to
remember and do."

The National Boycott Commit-
tee calls for an immediate and
continuing boycott of the follow-

mg:
Products of the Coca Cola Com-
pany including Coca Cola, Fresco,
Sprite, Tab, Tekotee, Real Gold
products, Hi-C, Minute Maid,

Anti-limit Action

The Union for National Draft
Opposition (UNDO) is ‘attempt-
ing to hasten the end of the
lndochina War by opposing the
draft'. The program of UNDO is
four-fold: l) to provide ‘legal and
public moral support’ for those
who refuse induction; 2) to clarify
the nature of the conscientious
objector status; 3) to gain public
support for ending the draft. and
to exert political pressure to do
so; 4) to encourage all people to
exercise their full legal rights to
deny Selective Service of draftees.
