  Others Arrested;
Security Fac

by Al Senia

Jack Schwartz, a University
Senator, became the last student
arrested in connection with the
incidents of last Monday at the
Library. His arrest brought the
total number to three; last week
two other :UNY students, Bob
Bernstein and Georgia Lee were
also arrested by campus security
and released on bail.

Schwartz was apprehended at
his apartment Monday morning
by John Heniganlt, security inves-
tigator. He was charged with
second degree tampering and later
released on $250 bail.

More arrests will follow. in fact,
some additional warrants have
already been issued but, not yet
served.

Meanwhile, Central Council
issued a position statement de-
ploring any arrests for petty van-
dalism (included under this is
library arrests), and condeming
security's undercover operations.
Council also threatened to take
legal action to require security
chief Connally and inspector
Henighanl to wear badges while on
duty. The bill was introduced by
Joe Kaiser.

At yesterday's faculty meeting,
professor Walter Goldstein of the
political science department ver-
bally chastised security for the
continuing arrests and introduced
a bill calling for amnesty for
students involved in the library
incident and pillar painting. The
motion was tabled.

Chief Connally, who has been
caught in the crossfire. continues

WHERE THE
(and g

' "When I was your up..."

to claim that the arrests are
simply the end result of an inci-
dent in which iIIWS were broken
and security was obliged to make
arrests.

He has strongly denied that
Schwartz' arrest was political in
nature. Rather, he feels that
Schwartz was easily identified,
since he is known to a large
segment of the campus com-
munity.

(The basis of the case lies in the
identiﬁcations made by both
Inspector Henighan and a number
of persons-including one faculty
member-who were at the library
during the incident and ‘wanted
something done’.)

Connally has also denied that
the administration is applying
pressure to arrest or harrass cer-
tain students, who might be clas-
sified as ‘radical'. Security has
made the arrests independently,
without consulting any admini‘
strators.

Another area where Connaily
has come under increasing fire
involves the motion picture
camera which he used last Monday
afternoon at the flagpole.
Connally claims that he was just
testing the camera at the time.
This seems possible, since the
camera is not yet owned by se-
curity, but rather by Burns
Camera Shop in Albany. Also, the
ﬁlm used was color~and not black
and white, which is used in nor-
mal surveillance work since it is
quicker to develop. (The films
shot last week will not be pro-
cessed and returned until Monday
or Tuesday)

es Criticism

Connaily, in an attempt to allay
student fears, has stated that
security's major concern is not
surveillance of student demonstra-
tors. No photo file exists in the
security building. It is possible
that once the pictures are pro-
cessed they will be shown either
to student leaders or the general
public--uncut. Connolly, who has
had his own run-ins with the
administration, is not opposed to
the campus demonstrations as
long as they are non-violent. ‘I
don’t blame students for their
attitudes on their administrators’,
he said.

Grading Policy

The following is a memo to the
University Community from Presi-
dent Kuuslrto which attempts to
clarify the grading policy adopted
by the Faculty at their Friday
meeting.

because of questions of inter-
pretation of the resolution passed
by the faculty May 8, on the
evening of May 11, 1970 members
of the Executive Committee of
the University Senate recom-
mended to me lute... “ an
guides to implement the resolu-
tions. These, 1 have accepted in
substance as follows:

1. The phrase “Students shall
have the option of . . ." means
that each student has the option,
not that a class will adopt a group
option.

2. Faculty are encouraged to
counsel students on the implica-
tions of selecting various options,
but shall not deny a student an
option he has made.

3. Class attendance is not related
to the right of selecting an option,
though it may be a factor in
fulfilling certain ones: e.g., option
“a”. Students selecting option
"c", for example, may still attend
classes.

4. The pass or no credit grades
provided in option “8" will be
“S” and “U”. An "S" grade will

computation of cumulative aver-
age. For this semester only, S-U
grades are authorized for any
course for students at any level
even though not previously ap-
proved.

5. “Present grade", under option
“c”, shall be based on assigned
work due before May 4, 1970 and
shall not include work either as-
signed or due on, or after, that
date. Work due by May 4 but not

6. The option of taking a “W”
by May 22, 1970 continues to
exist in every course for the Un-
dergraduate Student.

7. The written record of a stu-
dent's option shall bear the stu-
dent's signature and shall be re-
tained by the instructor.

8. Each instructor has the
authority to:

(i) Define "normal course re-
quirements" and determine letter
grades under option "a".

(ii) Specify requirements to be
met in removing an incomplete
under option "b" and assign the
grade when the course require-
ments have been completed.

(iii) Determine “present grade"
under option "c".

(iv) Determine what constitutes

Council Considers legal lotion

Last. Thursday, Central Council
called upon the law firm of
Rosenblum and Leventhal, S.A.
lawyers, to “take necessary legal
action to close the University im-
mediately."

Council stated that the “im-
portance of human life" made it
absolutely necessary to close
down the university. The action
was imperative because of the
numerous successful and un-
successful arson attempts on the
Quads and the Administration

budding. it was felt that personal
safety was impossible in so vola'
tile an atmosphere.

The law firm, however, when
called on Friday morning, May 8,
around 7:30 a.m., refused to take
the case because the firm and
Student Association would make
fools of themselves. The firm‘s
reason for refusing Council’s or-
ders was that nothing had
happened the night before, and
therefore their case would not
stand in court.

Building The Consciousness

Continued from Page I
"We care—for human life. Don‘t
you see, our allegiances are to
humanity, not nationality? Don't
you see? Can't you see? Please,
you must see!"

Hate-filled stares answered.

Gritted teeth responded to cries
for peace.

Hardened looks.

Angry.

Uncomprehending.

And the fear grew.
And the tensions grew.

And for the first time. the

seriousness hit. Hard.

And then, the incidents. They
were short. But they were
frightening.

Leadership led and led well.
While others reacted instinctively,
the few reacted thoughtfully.

The police (the truth may be,
after all, strange, but it is the
truth) stopped the incidents and
most of the fear.

And the day was won. And the
people had emerged, victorious.

And then it was over.
And the tensions melted.
And the pride grew.

And the crowd was reassured.

Unity emerged—of a kind.

There were complaints and there
were disagreements. Tactics con-
flicted. ideologies seemed stunted.
Knowledge was still spotty.

But they had emerged. together.
unhurt. The power, illusory or
not, had been flexed, and flexed

well.
"I! was a beautiful demon-
slration."

in the midst of the reality of
life, it seemed a dream. But it had
happened. The consciousness-the
taste of what it is all about. it
grew.
