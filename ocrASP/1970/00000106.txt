Student Association law suit
freezes some 8d. funds

This past summer Student Association became the respondent in
a lawsuit. ‘his law suit questions many areas of student fiscal
operations. Currently all funds for the Free School, the Third World
Liberation Front. the Day Care Center (only the SA $5,000
commitment), and unpaid bills of last spring's strike are frozen by a

court restraining order.

Among many things this law suit will determine who has the
authority over Student Association's Funds. Currently it is the
studean who exercise independent control over their activities
money. Also the legality of many expenditures is being tested. This
matter is currently in the Supreme Court of New York, and Student
Association has several lawyers working on the case,

Toward an independendent press

The Albany Stu

Maintaining a strong and in-
dependent student press is an in-
volving task. Maintaining that
pres in an expanding, major uni»
ver. ty requires high levels of or-
ganization, journalistic quality
and scope of coverage. As a uni-
versity grows up, so its press must
grow up with it.

Never before in the histroy of
this university have the demands
placed upon its newspaper been so
great, To publish a student news-
paper today requires frequent
publicatioii, a much expanded re-
porting and technical staff, finan
cial independence and creativity
for beyond expectations of the
past. No ordinary tabloid will do,
It will not do at. all.

It follows that the possibili-
ties are greater- freedom of ex-
pression, involvement in the dia-
logue that will shape the direction
of thi. school, and, if attained
journalisac excellence that will
serve as a counter and alternative
to the established commercial
press of today,

Reorganization and improve-
ment requires many things:

An invitation to professional
jounalists in the area to discuss
their trade and to analyze our pre-
sent condition.

A complete enlargement of
the staff and the organization of
that staff through a comprehen-
sive system of news deadlines and
staff scheduling.

The introduction of creative
in graphics and photography,

Expanded coverage and more
frequent publication.

In previous years; the ASP
has been run in a collective or
co-operative way, This type of
organization invoIVed a loose orga-
nization, friendly and workable
people, who know each other's
likes and dislikes. 'l'he disadvan-
tages were the dilli 'ion and over-
lapping of responsibility, the linii»
tation of perspective, the length
of time to orientate new people to
the staff.

The ASP must now convert
to a different system-to a ladder-
-chain oi-ganizat n, run in a much
more more eflicient manner with
responsibility deistributcd in an
orderly manner and with ease-
entry provided for those interi..-
ted in writing or in producing the
paper.

Committee openings

Government Needs You

Students who are eager to get
involved with university govern-
ment can start now by applying
for the positions which are still
open on almost every level and
branch of university government.

Most of the 8 councils of the
University Senate have unfilled
student positions. Each council is
concerned with formulating uni-
versity policies in a specific area
and initiating appropriate legisla-
tion for Senate action.

Interested students should fill
out an application in CC 3.16, the
Student Association Office.

ent Press

Currently. the technical staff
cons ' of a few editors and
associates. To run the IBM selec-
trieomposer, the vci'itype-headline
machine, do past ups and lay-
outs, a staff of Ir .20 should be
maintained.

Currently, the ASP published
twice a week. It should publish
three times weekly.

Currently, the ASP ventures
no more than 12 pages. For a uni-
versity of this size and for the
revenue that could be obtained
from advertising, it should enlarge
to let-20 pages.

These some of the prob-
lems and some of the goals. The
first problem is people, We need
reporters. We need technical peo-
ple. We need creative people.

When you have a vision ofan
independent newspaper, it is hard
to get rid of it.

The Free School

The free school, formed at.
the end of 1‘. year, is now sche-
duling cour workshops and
group aclivitie. of all kinds, A
schedule and listing of courses and
activities will be published short-
ly. The people who formed the
free school, who asked Gerry Wagv
ner to be its first director feel
strongly that the State University
is inherently incapable of provid-
ing a student till he needs to “ be-
come all he is capable of being."
Rigid departmental structures, ad-
ministratch rules, iind faculty iii-
erlia often militate against the cre-
ation of certain leiiriiiiig environ-
mcnts which would be conducive
to the total (levvlopmeiit of the
student, At the same time, many
students who exist within tliv uni~
vvrsity share common inte
btil are unaware of this sharing.

   
  

    

.1
r:

The free school has been
established by the Student Associ-
ation to remedy the problems
mentioned above. The free school
provides the structure, the resour-
ces, and the personnel necessary
to provide the type of educational
experience which is so difficult to
arrange within theI context of the
formal university.

We wish to make it clear that
We are not duplicating the acade-
mic prugram. The program we are
instituting will be a student-cen-
tered program. The students will
design the program and imple-
ment it. Further, the program will
emphasize areas which are not
commonly attended to iit Albany.

The primary purpose of the
free school is to provide the
opportunity for any student who
wants to either offer a course, get
together with other students to
form ii Workshop, or simply find
other students with the same in-
terest to do so. For example, if
some student is especially interes-
ted in 1 Citing he might be able to
get together a group of similarly
interested students, find someone
willing to offer a course or lead a
seminar, and get started.

I if you are interested in .ead-
ing a "course" or participating in
one contact Gerry Wagner, direc-
tor of the free school, Jeff Wasser-
man, Doug Goldschmidt, or Strut-
toii Riiwson through the Student
Association Office, Rm 346 of the
Campus Center.
