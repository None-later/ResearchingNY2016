COURT ORDERS BUDGET FREEZE

by lra Wolfman
Staff Reporter

‘ALL STUDENT ASSOCIA-
TION GROUPS’ BUDGETS ARE
FROZEN.’ Those words, in a
memorandum from SA Presiden
Dave Neufeld to all Student As-
sociation groups last Thursday.
signalled the latest~1md most dra-
matic~ outcome of a nearly year--
long controversy over the use of
mandatory tax fees.

After months of debate over
the propriety of the use of tax
money for supposedly “partisan
groups," Ken Stringer, a senior
here, initiated a Civil Court case
against the University and Student.
Association in an attempt to
either eliminate the mandatory
tax or to get specific guidelines
prescribing expenditures. The re—
cent budget freeze comes as a
result of that court case, via a
decision handed down by Justice
Harold Korcman of the New York
State Supreme Courl last Thurs-
day.

As a result of that decision, all

SA groups have been prohibited
from spending any money which
derives from mandatory tax until,
in the words of Koreman‘s deci-
sion, they receive the “determ-
ination and approval of the trus-
tees as to whether they are educa-
tional, cultural, recreational or
social in nature."

In effect, what this does is
revoke the authority which SA
has enjoyed in dealing with the
funds collected from mandatory
tax. Koreman‘s decision was based
on the fact that, since the Board
of Trustees had actually become
the enforcing agency for col—
lection of the tax, it still retained
responsibility for the use of the
funds. “in view of the require-
ment for payment of the activities
l‘ee before a student may be regis—
tered, and that fact that grades
and transcripts may be withheld
for failure to pay,thc TRUSTEES
have effectively established a man
datory activities fee." (Emphasis
added).

Council Calls For Action

 

“In the court‘s opinion, it can-
not be said," Koreman's decision
goes on, "that the officials of the
University have no voice or con-
trol over appropriations or ex-
penditures of the fund(N0te:this
point may have been made by the
defense, in stating that SA had
always been autonomous in deal-
ing with funds) since appropri<
ations may be made by the stu-
dents only ior the purposes per-
mitted by the Trustees" the edu-
cational, social, cultural, and re-
creational concerns). In his con
clusion, Koreman states that
“since the responsibility of admin-
istration and supervision in this
area rests with the Trustees, ap-
propriations or expenditures may
not be made without the approval

Security Faces Crisis

At the beginning of this am
demic year, Albany State's cam~
pus security force is at a crucial
point in its development.

A search is currently underway
to fill a new position Director of
Security which, it is hoped, will
bring greater efficiency and pro-
fessionalism to the SUNYA police
force.

Central Council Thursday night
called for the establishment of a
vicilizm review board. Such a body
could play a major role in detcr~

mining security's future priorities
and establishing needed rapport
with the student body.

But security faces immediate
problems which will not be bth
t'icd soon.

A major area of concern is the
shortage of manpower, There are
currently less patrolmen on the
force than at. this time last year,
Meanwhile, trends indicate a sub-
stantial increase in pmumncl (as
oppcsed to property) crimes. This
would include the areas of rob-
bery, assault, and sex offenses,

And, qualified applicants to the
security force cannot be found, a
result of the low pay offered.

An expected legislative approv
priation has become bogged down
and will not be forthcoming fora
number of months.

of the Trustees as to the purpose
for such appropriations and ex-
[)1 nditures."

The entire question of who
shall control the disbursement of
student funds is an extremely
touchy one. By revoking SA's
autonomy, the court decision may
have opened the doors to censor-
ship and regulation of necessarily
independent student organiza-
tions. It is mainly for this reason
that Student Association is going
to appeal the decision, and it is
for this reason that the case is
being followed with great interest
across the state.

An appeal will be entered as
soon as is possible by SA's law-
yers; the court to which the ap-
peal now goes is the N.Y. State

Appeals Court, the highest state
court. No action can be taken,
however, until Justice Koreman
releases his “judgement,” a docu-
ment which instructs all parties as
to the final effects of the decision.
The judgement should be coming
out some time this week.

In the interim, a meeting of the
SUNY Board of Trustees is
scheduled for tomorrow in New
York City. It is expected that a
temporary solution will be
worked out there which will at
least enable the SA groups cur-
rently cut off from funds to
function once more. However, a
long range solution must be ar-
rived at, so the courts have not
seen the last of “Kenneth Stringer
vs. Gould, et al."

Building.

Sixty Press for Day Care

Women’s Lib Stages Crib-in

by Maida Oringher
Armed with
riages and babies, nearly 60 wo-

balloons, car-

rncn, children, members of The
Women's Liberation Front, Corr
corned Parents, and The New Left
Organizing Committee staged a
“crib-in" at President Ilenezet's
office Thursday demanding "a
written report" from the admin-
istration on the status the
campus day care center.

The group entered the admin-
istration building, tacked up a
banner reading “Women Demand
Day Care " and handed the pres»
ident a sheet of demands. These
.‘includod a day care center for
children 6 months to 6 years,
adequate funds for a minimum of
l()() children, a questionnaire to be
sent out to all students, faculty,
and staff to determine the number
of children eligible for the day
care center, and a democratic
board of directors with the fol-
lowing memborshipmrnembcrs of
Women's Liberation Front, stud-
ent parents, faculty parents, staff
parents, the director of the day
care center, the president of the

of

university, and a budget analyst.

The cry for a day care center
began last February when the
Women's Liberation Front de-
manded “that SUNY at Albany
establish a full time infant and
child care center for the children
of students, employees, and fac-
ulty." 'l‘he several meetings, in
quiries, and conferences that fol-
iowud resulted in the formation of
a committee chaired by Mrs.
Barbara Pclton.

Prompted to “speak now!" the
President read a memorandum
concerning the child day care pro-
ject. The memo stated that a
favorable answer is expected from
Central SUNY concerning the re-
lease of university funds, and a
grant of $lt),000 has been made
toward the Child Day Care Center
facility by the Benevolent Assoc-
iation. “The release of funds from
the State will be an emergency
grant but further grants will have
to be made by supplemental ap-
propriation by the lagialaturo.’

A prospective director of the
Center has been chosen. And, at a
later interview Seth Spoilman,

Assistant to the President, men-
tioned that plans are “moving on"
concerning the renovation of P
ierce Hall on the downtown cam-
pus; howeuer, no date has been set
for the opening of the center.

The day care center would be
limited to serving the children of
SUNYA students and students'
wives, and fees will be charged on
a sliding scale to be established by
the office of Financial Aid. “Any
students able to pay will be exv
pected to do so." According to
Speilman, the center will be ableto
accommodate 46 children from
the money now available.

Although some angered stud-
cnts denied it, the President as-
sured them that the information
it? this memo had been available
to the leaders of the Women's
Liberation Front on Tuesday.

President Benozet commented
that the group had "risked for
nothing unreasonable" and that
he felt "assured that. the project
will succeed and could become a
model of Child Day Care Center-
ln universities."
