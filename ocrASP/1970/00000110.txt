menls which this decision might
also affect shortly.

In other action, last Thursday
night Council once again appealed
to the administration, faculty and
students to grant recognition of
the religious beliefs of students by
not holding classes on the Jewish
New Year, Rush Hashanab. The
bill asked that no classes he held
starting at noon September 30
until the following Monday.

Council also approved a bill
recommending the establishment
of a Civilian Review and Advisory
Board to Campus Sccurily. The

Faculty

board is to be constituted of four
undergraduates, one graduate stu‘
dent, two faculty members one
member appointed by the Presi-
dent of the university, and the
Security Chief. The board is to
study its legal rights to act upon
specific allegations and make rc—
commcndutions to the adminis-
tratiun.

Finally, a giant step was taken
by Council when a bill was ap-
proved, lli-ldi, to authorize Busi-
ness Committee to negotiate for
game machines for the Campus
Center.

Senate Urges

Jewish

by Bob Warner

The University Senate almost
unanimously recommended to
President Benezct that the univer-
sity “suspend all classes'on the
Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashan'ah,
commencing noon on September
30 through Friday, October 2,
1970,andto suspend all classes
after noon on October 9 through
Saturday, October 10 for the
Yom Kippur holiday."

The initial resolution was
amended by Dean Pcrlmutter in
order to gain further support for
suspension of classes. The
amendment, which was accepted,
called upon the faculty to make
up classes in "such manner" as
necessary.

The resolution, introduced by
Dave Neufcld, Lenny Kopp, and
its chief lobbyists, the Hillel Soci-
ety, spearheaded the debate for
the adoption of the bill. Their
argument centered around the
principle that if a Christian reli-
gious holiday such as Good Fri-
day, is a reason for the closing of
the University, then certainly a
Jewish high holy day could be the
basis for the suspension of classes.
The point in question was the
equity of the school calendar. At
one point, a Hillel member who
was recognized by President
Benezet, called the resolution‘s
opponents discriminatory toward
Jewish students.

The resolution's opponents fo-
cused their argument both on
moral and legal grounds. The mor»
nl problem seemed thc be the
separation of church and state.
Some Senators could not accept
the idea of any university holidays
based on religious grounds.

Dean Morris raised the possibi.

Recess

lity of withdrawal of state aid and
accreditation if the university had
cancelled classes. As the calendar
now stands we are scheduled for
the bare minimum of school
weeks required by state education

.law, and it was this fact that

necessitated Dean Perlmutter’s
amendment. Stony Brook and
Harpur have cancelled classes, but
the Jewish holidays were ac-
counted for during the writing of
their calendars which was not the
case here at Albany.

It was also stated that the
Board of Trustees prohibited any
cancellation of classes for any
reason during the year. Therefore,
President Benezet suggested using
the term “suspension” instead of
“cancellation” to avoid any legal
problem.

Dr. 'l‘hornc maintained that
since many students were led to
believe last year that classes would
be suspended on the Jewish holi-
days, the administration for that
reason alone was under a moral
obligation to fulfill the expecta-
tions of students which it had
implanted.

In other business the Senate
voted (45-16) to curb its powers
in taking political stands. The
philosophy of Bill 197071-01
which was introduced by the Sen-
ate Executive Committee was that
“When a situation external to the
University is demonstrated to the
Senate’s satisfaction to affect sig-
nificantly the quality of the Uni-
versity's functioning, the Senate
may appropriately express its ap-
proval or disapproval and if cir-
cumstances seem so to warrant,
will seek endorsement of its
action from the Faculty and the
student body, through referen‘
dum. It shall be the responsibility
of the sponsors of any resolution
not calling for changes in the
policies or procodurcs of the Uni-
versity itself in demonstrate, in
