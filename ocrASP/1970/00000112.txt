Grunt Green is one of the
best guitarists in jazz today.

His simple, bluesy approach is
easy to listen to and this along
with his keen sense of rhythm,
results in LI distinctive flavor.
Green really eats up “Ease
Back," a hard stomping blues,
and plays some huir raising
lines over tenor riffs on James
Brown’s "I Don't." His only
Weak point is on “Cease the
Bombing," a slow medium
number. llis playing there
seems weak and uniinaginatiVe.
“Upshol.,“ ii short funky blues
based tin-me, has a wicked
opening attack by Green which
blossoms out into some nice
slender guitar stalcmcnts, and a
full, beautiful sound

Bartce, a liL'W'CUII‘ii'l‘ lo the
scene, has promise, but as yet
he sticks too closely to the
changes and seems to be un-
sure of himself on such songs
as “Upshot” and ‘Ease Biick.‘
He is more in command on ‘1
Don‘t," his best effort on the
date.
