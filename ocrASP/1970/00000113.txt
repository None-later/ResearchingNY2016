Candidates Exchange Views
At Hyatt House,

by Bob Baldassano

At a confrontation at the
Hyatt House in Albany last
Week the three Senatorial can-
didates informally debated.

Ottinger accused Goodell of in-
consistency. Goodell made it a
point of pride that he was capable
of change. And Buckley con-
demned them both.

United by their awareness of
the growing frustrations of the
people with their government,
the candidates propounded their
individual, philosophies to a ga-
thering of the New York State
Publishers Association.

The key issue was the ability
of democracy to function. No
panacea was offered, no lasting
remedy promulgated. But a
sense of imminent destruction
was imparted to the audience if
no solution within the system
was established. The candidates,
Senator Goodell, Rep. Ottinger
and Mr. Buckley pointed out
that Washington was somehow
responsible and in a large was
accountable for the country's
loss of confidence in its go -
Vernment.

The first speaker, Rep. Ottin-
ger, maintained that the fedef'
al government's inability to lis-

ten to the people was the
“central issue of the coming
decade." The mood of the

country is "not reactionary,
but frustrated by unworkable
programs." He questioned the
role of the elected official in
creating social change. He poin-
ted out that such officials
should act as catalysts, to bring
positive reactions from the Exc-
cutivc as well as to sponsor
such positive actions themselves.
The vicious cycle of welfare
must be broken, quality hous-
ing must become a reality and
the utilities and services must
raise their standards; these were
cited by the Congressman as
positive actions. Ottinger called
Ralph Nader typical of the
men American politics must
produce if the country wished
to continue functioning.
Senator Goodell emphasized
his experience in Congress. He
pointed cut that during his
terms of office as a Represen-

Also discussed during the for-
um was the freezing of Student
Association funds by a court or-
der. The enjoining of student
funds is the result of a lawsuit
brought against SA, contesting al-
location of student funds to po-
litical groups. Student Association
President Dave Neufeld pledged
that as many student organiza-
tions as possible will continue to
operate through the use of private
contributions. He also stated that
the court's decision will be ap-
pmled. Final decision as to the
allocation of SA monies awaits
action by the Board of Trustees,
which is expected to meet next
week.

Questions concerning the con-
structlon of the Day Care Center
and the Pass/Fail grading system
were also brought up at the meet-

ing.

tative, he was Repu can
blindly following “the negative
and sterile" approaches of his
party. As a Senator, however,
he has changed most specta-
cularly on the war issue. Dur-
ing the early sixties he said
that he espoused the philoso-
phy of Barry Goldwater and at
the end of the decade, though,
he was the first to sponsor
legislation to end the war
through unilateral withdrawal.
Still, whatever sentiments may
have inspired this change of
heart, Senator Goodell realizes
he has problems within the Re-
publican party. These were
sloughed off with the statement
that Goodell considers himself
no party man who voted strict
party line. Earlier in the day,
however, Rockefeller announced
that Goodell was the Repub-
lican on the ticket to stay and
he gave the senator his full

support.
Senator Goodell sees as the
cause of the domestic crisis

the endlessly prolonged conflict
in South East Asia, which has
drained off much of the mon-
ey necessary to clear the social
blight on this country.

The incumbent declared that

is made upon the policies of
this country, we should not re-
sort to the streets to solve is-
sues.‘ As a note of clarification,
Buckley, before the address,
pointed out the universities are
chartered to educate people,
but he stated explicitly that
education was entirely alien to
awareness of social priorities

and the need for social change. '

Rights Conference

Held Here

by Mary Ann Meyer

Demands and tactics to elimi-
nate sex discrimination in the
education and employment poli-
cies of SUNY were finalized here
Saturday at the second meeting of
the Caucus on Women‘s Rights.

The demands which, if met,
could ultimately affect woman's
role in the family and saciety, had
been previously drawn up at the
first meeting held June 20 at
Syracuse University.

These demands, some of which
include the grounds for the fed-
eral complaint filed against
SUNYA. have been adopted into a
proclamation which will be pre-
sented to the university.

Saturday

The proclamation, approved
by vote of over seventy repre-
sentatives of the state system in-
cluded demands for the abolition
of sexism in all courses, the estab-
lishment of women’s studies, equal
pay scales and benefits, one half
of all scholarships and fellowships
to be awarded to women and
various changes in employment
practices concerning hiring of hus-
bands and wives. A free 24 hour
child care center was also listed.

The tutics used, in addition to
the federal complaint, will include
getting the endorsement of local
and statewide faculty senates,

directly out of high
school. In 1966, while the Viet-

Officers Candidate School. It was
common knowledge at that time
that all commissioned officers
would serve in Vietnam.

After Vietnam, Stringer entered
Albany State. As he pursued his
studies in history, his dislike for
mandatory tax grew. He came to
believe that the tax represented an
"expropriation of personal pro-
pcrty by a state institution"
which violated his property rights
as a student of this university.

In Slringer‘s own self-appraisal
his motivations were both “sclfv
ish" and "individualistic." He felt
that as a student who paid man-
datory tax he should have a say
in how those funds were used.

The resolution is somewhat
similar to the faculty's “Non-Po-
litical University” stance which is
a reaction to last year‘s strike, and
the Senate's anti-Vietnam War re-
solution.

In a bill to revtse the voting
procedure of the Senate, the
quorum call of that body was
reduced from 60% of its member-
ship (which is 100) to 50% plus
one member.

The purpose of the revision was
to enable an easier flow of Senate
business because quorums are not
easily filled, and because it makes
the possibility of any boycott to
impede Senate business less likely.

WSUA Investigated
By Central Council

by Carol Hughes
News Editor
Alleged violation of Student Association financial policy and
mismanagement have resulted in a Central Council investigation of the

campus radio station WSUA.

A committee, headed by Tom Clingan, was appointed by Central
Council President Dave Neufeld “to immediately investigate the whole
operation of WSUA, i.e. past, present, and future," according to the

Council resolution.

Council ordered the inquiry on the basis of a bill introduced by Jeff
Wasserman which charged “gross violation and patent neglect of the
Constitution of Student Association, Student Association Financial
Policy, the Constitution of WSUA, and the Laws of the New York

State..."

The original bill called for a complete shut down of the station at
midnight September 24. However, sensing the need for communi-
cation to continue, Council amended the bill, allowing the station to
continue broadcasting, under the supervision of the committee.

Wasserman, in arguing for passage of the original motion, contended
that WSUA had been fiscally irresponsible on several counts --

overspending, crossing budgetary
misuse of income.

lines, forgery of vouchers, and

Members of WSUA justified their handling of funds on three basic

points. First, most of the money
was spent to facilitate the move
uptown (which, according to SUA
sources, was promised by Student
Association) and to update equip-
ment uptown. (WSUA broadcasts
from Brubacher Hall on Alumni
Quad). Secondly, since most of
the large expenditures occurred
over the summer, it was difficult
to reach Central Council members
for consultation on budgetary
changes. Furthermore, to go on
the air, certain budgetary lines
had to be crossed to finance the
purchase of all the necessary
equipment to broadcast.

However, members of Central
Council felt that these expend-
ltures needed further justification.

According to Clingan, results of
the committee‘s investigation will
be released at the October 8th
Central Council meeting. In the
meantime, the station's operation
has been left to the Station Man-
ager and the Executive Committee
of WSUA.

Although the Council bill called
for the relinquishing of keys to
the President of Student Associa-
tion, keys were not taken, and the
regular functioning of the station
has not been disturbed. The sta-
tion was forbidden, however, to
make on the air editorials on the
investigation, so that the commit-
tee's findings may not be pre-
judiced.

New Albany Director Sought

. The following is the second in a
series of three articles investi—
gating the present state of security
on campus and the fulure course
ofSecurily operations.

by Al Senia
Features Editor

The new Director of Security on
the Albany State campus will have
“an extensive background in mili-
tary research,” according to in-
formed sources.

If this is the case, the effect such
a choice would have on
security operations and priorities
would be substantial and could
increase the possibility of renewed
student-security alienation.

The ﬁnal selection has not yet
been made by the eight-member
search committee which is
currently screening applicants.
Nearly all of those interviewed
thus far, however, have been re-
tired members of the armed
forces, veterans of Southeast Asia,
and have had a solid background
in the field of military intelli-
gence.

“I would say," this reporter was

told, "that based on the appli-
cations reviewed thus far, there is
a very good chance the person
chosen will have an extensive
background in military research
and intelligence."

This new director will be respon-
sible for enforcing “federal, state,
and local laws as well as the laws
of the campus," according to
central administration guidelines.
The choice,therefore, of the new
director will assume~ more signifi-
cance than choices of past
chiefs Security’s responsibili-
ties are being expanded to cover a
wide range of statutes, rather than
just being concerned with
camp us-rela ted crime.

In less than a year Albany State
may find itself with a professional
police force, headed by a full time
director with an extensive military
background, and having a juris-
diction encompassing all types of
crime.

spiraling crime rates, and growing
student distrust. Most other forces
in the SUNY system share the
same problems.

It was because of this that the
central administration conducted
a survey and developed a program
designed to upgrade security
operations throughout the system
Last spring‘s disturbances served
as a further stimulus to SUNY
Central.

The key to this efficiency drive
is the creation of a new position—
Director of Security-on each of
the SUNY campuses. He would be
a full time professional, respon-
sible for maintaining and moderni-
zing local security police forces.

Here at Albany State, Chief of
Security James Connelly will
become an assistant to this
director.

tinihurg, Wagner
linen Free School

Allen Ginsberg and Gregory
Jorso poet laureate of America’s
youth culture spoke Sunday night
to a crowd estimated at 1200 in
Albany State's gymnasium.

The poetry reading sponsored
by the Free School also featured
appearances by Gerry Wagner,
whose dismissal from the Rhetoric
and Public Address faculty caused
an uproar on campus last year.

Wagner read two poems ending
with his message to the crowd,
summarizing, he said “where his
head is at now.” “If it feels good
and doesn't hurt anybody, do it.‘

The evening’s events had started
with a spirited rendition of pop-
ular and folk music by Hector
Rivera, a student here at Albany.
His selections included: “Wood-
stock," “In My Life,“ “Fire and
Rain," and “Tommy.”

Then Wagner strode to the pod-
ium, gave brief comments about
his court trial and welcomed the
audience to the first event of the
Free School. He pledged that the
school would continue operating,
even though its funds are caught
in the general budget freeze order-
ed by SA President Dave Neufeld
as a result of last week’s Supreme
Court decision.

The highlight of the evening was
an all too short appearance by
Ginsberg who began by soothing
the audience with a prophetic
recitation from the works of
William Blake. The 44 year old
poet accompanied himself on the
'ecorder.

He then read apoem he had
written only a few weeks before.
Using his famous stream of con-
sciousness technique, be outlined
his reactions to the current eco-
logical crisis. His farm in the
country, the imprisonment of
compatriot Timothy Leary, and
the pollution-laden Hudson River
were among the topics he touched
upon.

Then it was Corso’s turn and as
he began reading from his works
some of the audience drifted out.
He developed a quick rapport
with the remaining members of
the crowd who demanded and
received a poetic encore.

STREP STRIKES

by Terry Wolf

Dr. Rudolph Schmidt, acting
director of the infirmary, in
answer to the many rumors about
an epidemic of strep throat, ad-
mitted there was an outbreak of
the infection.

Dr. Schmidt clarified some of
the misunderstandings which have
been circulating campus. He ad—
mitted there was an outbreak of
upper respiratory infections and a
rash of sore throats. Dr. Schmidt
stressed the fact that there were
more colds reported than usual
but it had not reached epidemic
proportions.

Students have been found to
have strep throat. It is prevalent
throughout the living areas al-
though it is particularly colleen-
trated in one of the quadrangles.
The State Health Department has
been on campus taking a survey of
students, both those that are sick
and those who linVe not demon-
strated any symptoms, in an ef-
fort to arrest the spread of the
strep—tococcus bacteria. In a re-
view of the random throat cul-
tures, it was discovered that a

disproportionate number of stu-
dents who do not appear sick are
carrying the bacteria. The food
handlers are also being tested as a
possible cause of the spread.

How the strep has been carried
is unknown at this time. The
major possibilities are through the
food or from person to person.
An investigation is being con-
ducted to answer the question.

In the meantime, the university
is taking preventive measures. Dr.
Schmidt has been in contact with
the State Health Department and
the US. Department of Health.
Since this is not an emergency, no
immediate action has been taken
yet. One possibility which is being
discussed is that of administering
preventative treatment at all the
living areas beginning with the one
which has reported the most cases
of sore throats. This would also
include students who are not ill.
Such action is being seriously con-
sidered because the bacteria can
affect the kidneys. Before any
measures can be initiated, a per-
mit will probably be regulred for
those students under 21. and tests
