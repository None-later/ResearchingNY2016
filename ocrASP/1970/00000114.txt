Rockefeller Against Crime

by Vicki Zeldin
“The crime and violence that
has become part of our daily
experiences" was the subject of
the speech delivered by Gov. Nel-
son Rockefeller to the NYS As-
sociated Press Association yester-

ay.

“The fight against crime,‘ said
the Governor, “is an issue on
which we stand united. Every
neighborhood, every race, every
age, every economic class..."

Rockefeller went on to discuss

what steps have been taken to
ease this problem. He cited the
reorganization and the more than ‘
doubling of the State Police
Force, the furthering of educa-
tional opportunities, and the set- '
ting of minimum standards for
local police officers. The establish- .
ment of special units to deal with
the problems of drug abuse and
the computerization of the forces
to enable quicker, more efficient
law enforcement, were, also
among the improvements that
Rockefeller called his own.

Trustees Concerned

Over Fund Freeze

by Linda Ulin

The State University Board of
Trustees has resolved nothing in
the current student tax contro-
versy. After nearly a year of dis-
agreement over the allotment of
the mandatory student tax not
even a short-range solution has
been reached to thaw frozen stu»
dent funds.

The Trustees met last. Wednes-
day and expressed “genuine con-
cern“ over Justice Koreman's de-
cision that student monies cannot
be appropriated without Trustee

approval. The Board gave its exec-
utive committee the job of investi-
gating all aspects of the problem
and reporting, at the next regular
ly scheduled meeting, on what
action should be taken.

The Student Association now
looks to the New York StatelAp-
peals Court for a possible reversal
of the Stringer vs. Gould verdict.
Until the Trustees decide how to
appropriate money to agencies
that are of “educational, cultural,
recreational or social in nature,“
the problem of what the various
SA funded agencies are to do still
remains.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Rockefeller also spoke as well of
the addition of 125 judgeships
and the creation of a Statewide
Prosecutor for Organized Crime as
a means of alleviating the backlog
in the courts. The Governor did,
hOWever, admit that the courts
were still backlogged. Rockefeller
also mentioned several other
measures that he had initiated
while in office to alleviate this
problem of crime.

Despite these steps Rockefeller
stated, “the problem of crime and
violence remains." Rockefeller
promised that if re-elected he
would provide more grants to
local governments for crime pro-
tection and put more policemen
on the street. He proposed that
more policemen be assigned to the
major problems of each com-
munitywdepcnding upon the
needs of the community. “But
additional police are not the only
measures needed to crack down
on crime," said the Governor and
he therefore proposed the follow-
ing: legislative authorization for
additional measures to improve
the administration of justice by
removing more non-criminal
offenses from criminal courts, by
providing criminal court judges,
and by authorizing at special pro-
cessing of trials on drug luw VlOllI-
tions.

Rockefeller closed his speech by
saying, "We must recognize that
crime will continue until we unA
dcrstttnd rind cure this basic illness
in our society,“ and he pledged
his total dedication to the people
of New York State in combatting
this problem.

HUUA'S'I'URIL‘ Why are the

find a book? Why is the fiction

does it have such great powers?
Why does it exist? How much
money did it make last year when

HOUSING: Why are the rooms
so small and the rents so high?
Who searches our rooms (they are

Walinsky, Paterson
Will Speak Today

Two maior candidates for state-
wide offices will speak today at
Albany State. Basil Paterson, the
first black candidate of a major
party for Lieutenant Governor
will speak at 6:45pm. in LC 5.
Adam Walinsky, the youthful no-
minee for Attorney General will
speak at 2:30p.m. in LC 7.

The nomination of Basil Pater-
son for Lieutenant Governor at
tracted wide interest because of
the racial precedent involved.
Paterson represents a Harlem dis-
trict in the State Senate and sits
on numerous committees includ-
ing the Labor and Industry, the
Housing and Urban Development
and the Judiciary Committees.

There is no group on campus
specifically organized to promote
the Goldberg-Paterson ticket.
There is such a group, however,
organized to promote the Walin-
sky campaign.

Alan Ryder, co-ordinator of the
Walinsky campaign at Albany
State, said that the main issue in
the campaign for Attorney Gener-
al is that “the Attorney General is
not using his powers to protect
the people of the State of New
York. Black people are not being
protected. The laws are not being
enforced."

Mr. Walinsky is hitting hard on
the lack of enforcement of racial,
and pollution statutes and the
general estrangement of the Atto-
rney General's office from the
“little people.”

Mr. Paterson was recently the
subject of controversy when Gov-
ernor Rockefeller was quoted as
“too bad he's not with us." Mr.
Rockefeller later denied that he
would have preferred Paterson to
Malcolm Wilson, the Republican
candidate, as his running mate.
