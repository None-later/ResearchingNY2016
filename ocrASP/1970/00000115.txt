Students Now Offered

‘Ticketron’ on Campus

The services of TICKETRON are
now available at the Campus Cen«
ter Information Desk. TICKET~
RON is a recent computerized
ticket agency that uses a single
computer in New York City and
services theaters and sports events
throughout the Eastern seaboard.
In fact. it allows you to order
tickets in the Campus Center for
performances in New York City.
Boston. Connecticut. New Jersey,
Canada. Philadelphia, Washington
DC. and Maryland.

Here‘s how it's done.

Each theater has its entire
seating plan for each performance
"memorized" by the TICKET-
RON computer center. Then each
TICKE’T‘RON outlet is wired
directly to the computer center
and can get an instantaneous re‘
port on the best seats available for
any performance for any attrac-
tion subscribing to the service.

Once you decide what night you
want to attend and what price
you want to pay. you tell the
TICKETRON representative, and
he places your order through the
computer center. By remote con-
trol your actual tickets are printed

by a process similar to teletype
and you leave the TICKETRON

outlet with your tickets in your

hand. You never have to visit the
box—office at the theater you plan
to attend; you never have to wait
in line in the lobby; you never
have to make any kind of ex-
change of the ticket you get from

TICKETRON for some other tic-

ket issued at the box office. Your

TICKETRON ticket is your thea-

ter ticket and indicates the date of

the performance. row and seat.

Once your purchase is com-
pleted. the computer center has
on record that your seat is no
longer available and it is ready to
report for the next customer just
what seats are still to be sold.

The cost of the ticket is the
exact price you would have to pay
if you bought it at the door, plus
a S .25 service charge.

So. if you ever decide to buy
tickets, look ﬁrst to your nearest
TICKE’I‘RON location. the Cam-
pus Center lnformation Desk. The
hours are Monday. Wednesday.
Friday and Saturday from 10 am.
to 2 p.m. and Tuesday and Thurs-
day from 11 am. to 3 p.m.

own nature as the reasoning
animal whose lack t.“ self know-
ledge prevents thc truthful com-
munication of his feelings in
others. The film is, in reality,
about the lies and self-dcceptions
that man disguises as thruths.

The setting is a bleak. frozen
island that for no apparent reason
is suddenly plagued with a series
of vicious animal killings. The
mysterious identity of the killer
is, however, not of primary con-
cern to Bergman. The situation is
used metaphorically to purulch
and explore the insensitive natures
of the characters.

A Bergman film is its characters,
and ANNA, being no exception. is
a showcase for a quartet of talent-
ed regulars.

Max Van Sydow is superb as
Andreas. who isolates himself
from other human beings through
an attitude of calculated indiffer-
ence. Bibi Anderson and Erlnnd
Josephson are the married couple
whose relationship has degenera-
ted to stalemate. in whichtheyare
nothing more to each other than
polite, emotionless strangers.

Liv Ullmann is fragile and hril-
liant as Anna. whose “happy”
marriage has been shattered by
the violent deaths of her husband
and son.

Anna's passion is truth as she
perceives it. and she spreads her
inflexible "faith" like a religious
zealot. Her relationship with
Andreas. however. becomes the
mirror image of her marriage. and
despite her incredible willfulness.
Anna's truth becomes just another
interpersonal lie.

Bergman‘s construction of the
film borrows heavily from Jenn
Luc Godard as the actors step out
of their roles to discuss their
characters in on-cnmera inter}
views. Bergman frequently nban-
dons the illustration of thoughts
and has chnrnctcrs reciting their
monologues and dialogues for the
camera to record. not tinliku
Godard.

He also incorporates llll' llivmvs
from his pnst films into the fabric
of ANNA. For cxnrnplc. the con
fusion of identity from I’I‘Ili

“Feiﬁerology” Aims   *

nothing but a roughly-cut
diamond. It is the director's job to
do the polishing up.

But when it comes to organlzlng
pantomimes. actors' exercises,
improvisations . or especially,
skits. the problems facing the
director are more basic. Here. he
must create order out of chaos.
He must. mould the disjointed
parts into a whole. In short, he
must lend coherence to his work.
Any successful (aesthetic or com-
mercial) production has that qua-
lity; Art without unity is meaning-
less.

In this respect,
FEIFFER 0L OG Y, Experime ntal
Theatre’s first; Friday Night pre-
sentation, failed. The evening was
advertised as “a series of dramatic
sketches." It was just that: a
series, not an organic entity. W.C.
Doscher. the director. forgot. pre-
sumably, to build his production
around a specific theme.
FEIFFEROLOGY drifted in all
directions; consequently. it went
nowhere. Not that a show should
be so tightly structured that it
cannot breathe. A certain loose-
ness is desirable. But. the presence
of a motif is essential, a central
idea which brings all other aspects
of the production into focus.

Unfortunately, lack of selecti-
vity was not the only problem
afflicting FEIFFEROLOGY. A
severe absence of creative imagina-
tion stunted the entire produ-
ction. Lights, for example, were
functional—at best. Ditto cos-
tumcs. sets.

The real catastrophe. however,
was the cast. Using the state like a
rhinoceros might. perform a sur-
gical operntion. they accompli-
shed Iittlc of value to posterity.
They looked stiff, off-balance.
nnd, maybe just as well for them.
insincere. I could not help feel
they were playing a part. and
bndly. To treat Feiffer like slap-

stick Is the same as showing “Our
Boy Dick" to recite Shakespeare
in publlc. That constant begging
for the belly-laugh was rather dis-
heartening. Towards the end. 1
was beginning to wonder if such
overbearing absence of subtlety
might have some relation to the
coming of the Apocalypse. I hope
not.

On the credit slde, there were
certain things worth praising. A
bundle of energy named Holly
Fitter gave the show some move-
ment. Rae Ann Crandall endowed
her part with a little bit of insight.
Katherine O'Connor combined
the angelic and the sexy. But the
main praise goes to Greg Haynes
and Hank Kuivile who seemed to
belong to another show.

Enough of this. Most. of the
actors in FEIFFEROLOGY can
do better than the flop that was
Friday night. Let us all. my
brethren. await happier times.
