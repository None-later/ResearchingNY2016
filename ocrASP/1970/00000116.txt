Qui Tam is an old legal principle
which allows you, the individual
citizen, to file suit in the name of
the government against people
who break certain laws, and then
collect half of the fine for a
conviction.

The idea has been getting a lot
of attention lately coupled with
another crusty old law called the
Refuse Act of 1899, which for-
bids anyone or any group from
throwing pollutants into any navi-
gable waters in the United States
without a permit.

What all this means is that now
you can proceed directly to your
local neighborhood industrial pol-
lutcr, 'get some information and
samples, and then file a suit which
could bring a fine of not more
than $2,500 nor less than $500
for each day of violation, of
which you get half. It could get
the pollutcr thrown in jail for not
less than 30 days nor more than 1
year, which is unlikely but nice to
think about.

Basically, once you find a pollu-
ter to attack, you should prepare
a detailed statement, sworn to
before a notary public, setting
forth:

the nature of the refuse material
discharged;

the source and method of dis-
charge;

the location, name aml address
of the person or persons causing
or contributing to the discharge;

each date on which the dis-
charge occurred;

the names and addresses of all
persons known to you. including
yourself, who saw or knows about
the discharges and could testify
about them if necessary;

a statement that the iscl‘large is
not authorized by Corps permit,
or, if a permit was granted, state
facts showing that the alleged
violator is not complying with any
condition of the permit;

if the waterway into which the
discharge occurred is not com-
monly known as navigable, or as a
tributary to a navigable waterway,

'state facts to show such status;

where possible, photographs
should be taken, and samples of
the pollutant or foreign substance
collected in a clean jar which is
then sealed. These should be la-
beled with information showing
who took the photograph or sam-
ple, where, and when, and how;
and who retained custody of the
film jar.

This will be your basic ammunit-
ion in the suit, and should be filed
in a U.S. district court, which
apparently have exclusive jurisdic‘
tion to hear and decide such suits.
The Supreme Court has upheld
Qui Tam suits in the past on the
basis that the citizen-informer has
a financial interest in the fine and
therefore can sue to collect it.

in July, the Justice Department
issued a fascinating memorandum
called “Guidelines for Litigation
Under the Refuse Act" and sent it
out to all U.S. Attorneys.

The prosecution policy state-
ment encouraged U.S. Attorneys
to use the 1899 law "to punish or
prevent significant discharges,
which are either accidental or
infrequent, but which are not of a
continuing nature resulting from
the ordinary operations of it man-
ufllcturing plant." (italics sup-
plied.)

lution posed “the greatest threat

to the environment," claimed that

the Nixon Administration was al-

ready hard at work to stop large
manufacturers from polluting.

Assistant Attorney General
Shiro Kashiva of the Justice De-
partment's Land and Natural Re-
sources Division has stated that
“we can see no justification for
allowing court actions by indivi-
duals."

In short, it seemed to some
environmentalists that the Nixon
Administration, despite its strong
rhetoric, was hedging in favor of
big business and industrial inter-
ests.

Reaction from many sides was
immediate and scathing:

--Stewart Udall, former Secre-
tary of the Interior, said, "En-
vironmentalists who fear that the
Nixon Administration‘s anti-
-pol|ution drive may be half rhet-
oric, half promises and half poli-
tics have found a strange new ally.
The Justice Department is trying
to prove they are right."

--The Conservation Foundation,
a respected national group, stated,
"Our basic difficulty...is with the
underlying policy of the (Justice
Department's) Guidelines...The
policy you articulate disregards
the theory behind the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act; fed-
eral leverage is required to force
states to establish and implement
water quality standards."

--And Henry Reuss, Wisconsin
Congressman, complained that the
Justice Department‘s "limited en-
forcement" doctrine “favors the
pollutcr over the public's interest
in preventing the pollution of our
waterways.‘

The basic problem in the entire
area of water pollution law en-
forcement and prevention seems
to be theundcrlying difference of
opinion between the Nixon Ad-
ministration and environmental
activists concerning individual citi-
zen involvement. Activists want to
increase it; the Administration
tries to decrease it.

A Redress of Grievance

 

 

Editorial Comment

Albany State has needed a day-care center since the day the
uptown campus was built. This is a suburban campus to which
most faculty and students commute relatively long distances.
Those with children have long since fell lhe need for an adequate
program of caring for infants as parents taught, studied or
worked.

The University has the responsibility to provide those within its
community with the services necessary to successfully function
therein. This service has for years been denied, often in the most
cynical of ways. The administration should be mindful therefore
that the service is not a bold innovation but to some extent, the
redress of grievance.

Dr. Benezet was correct in immediately asserting his intention of
establishing day care. It is apparent that he has made every
attempt to obtain funds, including the unusual move of personally
appearing before the University Budget Committee to explain lhc
need for funds.

Unfortunately, however, rehabilitation of Pierce llall basement
will not be completed unlil Dec. 1 and no prediction is being
made as to when llle facililiqs for day care will actually be
ingraucd, There have been reports as well, lllougll wholly
unconfirmed that Dr. Bcncxct has not asked for as much as
necessary to mccl the need, and therefore, they money obtained
would meet the cosls only for a limited operalion. A public
statement is necessary specifying llle amount rcqucslcd, not
simply lllc amounl granted. Moreover, the demand for a more
complete suery should immediately be met in determine the
actual extent of lhc need and the llalurc of daly cure required to
meet it.

Freedom

by Robert H. lsemlln
Class of [970

The author was originally a plalnilll in
the Stringer vs. Gould case.

 

i would like to take this oppor-
tunity to set the record straight
concerning the purposes and mo-
tives of our law suit against the
Central Council and the Trustees
of the State University of New
York; and hopefully dispel some
of the misconceptions that have
arisen over the past few months.

Particularly disturbing has been
the persistent efforts of some peo-
ple in politically label our actions.
For example, the ASP described
the law suit as a “conservative
protest." Ours is not a conser-
vative or liberal protest, but a
protest for individual freedom and
responsibility. Mr. Stringer and 1
object to the funding of any
political group with mandatory
student tax money, regardless of
its philosophy. We do not bulir-ve
that any individual should be
forced to fund and thus promul-
gate any political or moral idea
that he finds personally offensive.
If certain students lll SUNYA
wish to financially support nclivi~
tics such as the Studenl Strike

and Mandatory Tax

Committee, The Day Care Center,
peace rallies, the Free University,
and the Third World Liberation
Front, that is certainly their right;
but they have no right to coerce
the rest of the student body into
doing the same. in our opinion,
the ideal solution to the problem
is to eliminate the mandatory tax
and put all student activities on a
pay—ns-you-go basis. Unfortunate-
ly, Justice Koreman denied us this
remedy.

After Justice Koreman froze all
student funds some people asked
me if 1 wasn‘t sorry for all the
inconvenience that Ken and 1
caused the "moderate" students.
We caused no inconvenience, but
Central Council did. Had the more
“moderate” students cared
enough to vote in school elections
they could have averted the pre-
sent situation by electing more
responsible representativos. Our
suit can be directly attributed to
student apathy, and for that mat-
ter, so can the property damage
llll(l dislruptions that occured last
spring. Regrets? Yes, i do have
one. i regret that my June 1970
graduation prevented me from be-
ing an official plaintiff in the suit!

Finally, our motives have been
described as both "selfish" and
"individualistic." This description
is precisely CORRECT. We are
both extremely selfish with our
individual liberties; everyone
should bel! Those who are not
selfish with their freedom soon
lose it, and any man who tells you
that individual rights have to be
sacrificed to something called the
"greater good" is either a tyrant
or a fool. lndividualistic? Yes! We
refuse to accept the theory of
“social rights" as implied by such
proposed activities as the Day
Care Center. Since when has hav-
ing children become a social func-
tion? By what right does Central
Council decree that every student
must pay child support by fund-
ing the Day Care Center?

We believe that everyone must
have the right to decide what
causes they want to support. We
will not allow anyone to make
that decision or any other decison
for us. This is the motive behind
our legal action; to maintain free-
dom of choice, freedom of asso-
ciation, and to control the de-
cisions that ultimately affect our
lives as free individuals.

Whoops! The Thinking Toy

by Barry Kirsclnlcr

Witll illl‘ heavy burdens of be-
coming llll unclc about lo bc
lhrust upon my shoulders i fell it
my responsibility to find out what
is happening in the fantastic world
of ons. To do this 1 spoke to Sam
Somll-y at the ldclll Corporation.
The interview wont something like
lhc following:

“I heard you‘ve made some fall-
lasllc progress ill the field of toys
and dolls" (not lo be confused
wilh (luys and Dolls).

“Yes, the wonders of American
'l'cchnology can bc no more better
soon than ill the simulated nul-
cllinc and people industry. Wily
our products are capable of exter-
lnilulting millions of fabricated
enemies, and we also clln now
make dolls which not only drink
and wet, but can also solve simple
nu-chllnicul problems."

llllving resolver] in my lnilld thlll
should I be the uncle of a boy, the
only way he would play with
military hardware would be over
my dead body, l chose to ignore
thllt segment of the industry and
concentrate on what was llllp'
polling to the model pooples. I
asked Mr. Somley how he made
his manufactured people work.

"Well one must realize that we
are dealing with artificial people
and therefore must work with
artificial stimuli. in order to pro-
duce tllu reactions our corn ra-

tion wishes to instill in these toys,
we have been blessed by a govern-
ment grunt specifically earmarked
for researching how to keep arti-
ficial pcoplu from doing things we
don't want them to do."

Amazed at the idcn of artificial
pcoplc reacting any way other
lhlln the way prcordllincd for
them i asked how this might be
possible.

“Well wllut has happened is that
some of our dolls whom We pro-
grammed to talk and react acci-
dcntully picked up the ability to
think. Needless to say some of our
better schools are already in
chaos. Seems as if ideas spread
very quickly among our pro-
ducts.“

“Do you mean that there are
actually radical toys umollg lln
assembly line produced stock?‘

"Unfortunately. We make llllow-
llnccs for some dolls to have lollg
hair and shabby clothes, but we
expected all our products made in
this country to be-esscntially of
one materialr-plllstic."

"if you actually created schools
for these toys to go to, didn't you
expect they would learn to
think?" i uskud in my naive num-
nor.

“That was not in the plan. in-
structlon at our centers for educa-
tion were supposed to be comple-
tely programmed. The purpose of
these schools is to build artificial
people able to perform functions

 

their masters choose for them. ‘
“And what is the matter with
the free—thinking doll?"
“He obviously does not fit in

with the rest of his people. Not»

only is he unwilling to do mecha-
nical work, but some of these
radicals are trying to interject
philosophical questions into what
was once ll smooth running
business."

“By the way how is business?‘

“We're on the downtrend of the
cycle now, because we made the
mistake of putting certain chemi-
cals toughening our dolls' resist-
ance to spindling, folding, and
mutilating, a few years ago. Put
too much longevity in the natural
life of those dolls. Until the ’67
and '68 models start dying sales
on our new "71's will be off. The
decision to put those chemicals in
our old products sort of made us
look like dummies."

Choosing to ignore this last pun
and Sam‘s silly giggling. I thanked
him and left, hearing him say on
the way out “I hope the kid grows
up right. I got quite a few nieces
and nephews myself."

For some reason thinking about
the implications of the manu-
facturing plastic people wouldn't
let me rest, but fortunately a
television commercial had the
good sense to suggest that I take
two sleeping pills and go to bed,
and l obeyed.
