Honey, I'm hungry and the food stinks, and I’m getting sicker and
sicker of all the stuff like applications, petitions, and lines, and buck

passing bureaucrats; and James Joyce once wrote about cows but no
one cares—I do, but not much—and especially the cows don't care; i
saw a herd today near the milk machine, and it seemed funny, but I
was drowning in red tape, and no one can laugh while they’re
drowning unless of course they pretend they ain't goin down for the
third time—but it's hard to hide it when your clothes are all wet and
your eyes are all glassy; but you can tell them you’re high and they’ll
believe you, which I suppose makes it alright not by me, but by you;
and after a while, I mean after we’ve had enough of the inefficiency
peddlers, soul sellers and buyers, and criers and democracy soldiers
who kill for the pills, and teachers the preachers who make speeches
the leeches that suck and they pluck 'til we're nothing but bone, and
then educated we go happy home;and we would rather be stifled than
riﬂed to death, but the difference between these I wish we could find
please cause the stoney brain muggers, security huggers, the books no
one cares for of science of history, don ’t give an insight for solving the
mystery, and time is the crime we commit for out dimes, and that
sheepskin embossed is our rmtredom cross; and the time we leave here
with our robe and a tear in our eyes that has snowballed our senses to
believe that we've broken the barrier fences, when in truth youth was
stolen what was left was a hole in which we will be put in the name of
our freedom; our voices made the choice of the left handed column
and sacriﬁced all in that moment so solemn, we first entered school to

Dear Hef & Ziggy
ASP Feature Inc.

Dear Hef 8: Ziggy:

Now that the administration has accepted the right of Jews and
Christians to observe their religious holidays perhaps, at last, equal
recognition will be given to all religions. Being the Grand Erector and
Towering Head of “The United Priapic Sixth Minute Front of the
Nonyonic Rising Phallic Order" I have the responsibility of providing
the meeting place of the sacred ceremony of “Tricentenniai 'I‘rans-
terrestial Precarious Positioning of the Penisian Planets."

This ceremony takes place when the Van Allen Belt is transformed
into a precise replica of our Founder’s, Master Batus Organus,
genitilia. Commencement of services is signaled by the High Rod
blowing his horn. Some highlights of the mass include: The
distribution of the movement’s traditional dildoian fezes, the unison
offertory of the seminal prayer reiterating the Ten Phallic Fallacies,
the awe-inspiring sight of the ritualistic deep knee bend (done with
arms stretched rigidly overhead) and the sacrificial. page-boy haircut
received by the Grand Erector as a symbol of the demands modern
society places on the holders of the sacred pudenda. The soaring
finale, accompained by exciting organ music, is the formation of a
human obelisk composed of each member sequentially pyramiding on
one another‘s shoulders till the membership is molded into a human
lingam, ascending skywardsﬂeaching towards the great vision in the

heavens.

To bring my point to a head, I would like this campus (which
incidentally, was constructed as a shrine to our movement by one of
the cream of our crop) to host this obviously solemn rite.

So, Hef 8r Ziggy-holders of all wisdom knowers of truth, seers of
sooth, prophets of what will be, counselors of the humble masses and
second string assistant cleat pickers for the New York Mets' 'in what
manner does one obtain official permission to hold such a deeply

ecclesiastical celebration?

Your Honorable Erector:

It seems you have a problem.
There is a precise, official pro-
cedure that queries of this nature
must follow. You must first sub-
mit a written request to gain
permission to use the campus to
the Vice President in charge of
Student Affairs, who will refer
you to the Dean of Campus Acti-
uilies, who will refer you to the
Chairman of the Campus Program-
ming Committee, who will refer
you to the President of Women's
Liberation Front. who will refer
you to the Chairman of the Philo~
sophy Department, who will refer
you to [he chelicks club, who
will refer you to the head librar-
ian, who will refer you to the ASP
copy boy, who will refer you to
the Ralhshellar short order cook,
who will refer you to your RA.
(who can solve all problems). who
will refer you to the Ralhskellar
short order cook, who will refer
you to the ASP copy boy... Our
fez sizes are 8% and 7%.

 Acts To End Freeze,
To Investigate SUA Problems

by Ken Stokem

In an effort to thaw the court
imposed freeze of Student As-
sociation funds Central Council
passed a position statement, intro-
duced by Dave Neufeld, recom-
mending the Executive Commit-
tee of the Board of Trustees, of
the S.U.N.Y., to empower Presi-
dent Benezet to approve S. A's
budget and appropriations.

It was. SllPUIated that this state-
ment would be specifically termed
as an interim action and would be
superceded by any court action. It
was emphasized that this action
by Council was to be by no means
termed as a long-range asnwer to
the current court decision. Coun-
cil is continuing in its efforts to
appeal and overturn the Koreman
decision. '

The bill also recommended the
establishment of a series of study
groups consisting of one-half stu-

New Services

Mark Holiday

by Robert Schwartz

Searching for a unique and more
meaningful way of celebrating the
Jewish High Holidays, several
Jewish students are creating their
own experimental services for
Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur.

Since most Jewish students will
probably be going home for Rosh
Hashonah, the few remaining stu-
dents will meet at a private home
off campus for services. For Yom
Kippur, though, the group intends
to obtain the use of the Campus
Center Assembly Hall; ii. encour-
ages the entire campus community
to celebrate the holiday with
them.

Many Jewish students feel
divorced and alienated from tra-
ditional temple services which
tend to stifle rather than stimulate
their enthusiasm for Judaism, and
feel isolated from their fellow
Jews. The others, although able to
relate to traditional services, de-
sire to reevaluate both themselves
and their religious beliefs from a
much deeper and more critical
level.The group believes that the
High Holiday services should cn-
couragc a deeper and more spirit-
ual involvement on the port of
each individqu whilc also pro-
viding an atmosphere in which
individuals can freely express ller
religious thoughts and I'm-tings
with each other.

In order In providv this utnms
phcrc, tin: group is planning 2m
unstructured .wrvu‘v Ill Witlk'li any

dents and one-half rr ’ ‘ ‘
of Chancellor Boyer. The group I
are to consider such things as: the-
effect of the Koreman decision on
other campuses, manditory and
voluntary student tax. the current
guidelines for SA. expenditures as
outlined by the Trustees, and the
rights and responsibilities of stu~_
dents and how students moniesi
can be student‘controlled.

The bulk of last Thursday's
meeting was taken up in discus-
sion over whether or not WSUA
should have its budget frozen and
operations suspended. A bill intro-'
duced by Jeff Wasserman stated
the following: "WSUA has acted
in gross violation and patent ne-
glect of the Constitution of the
Student Association, S.A. finan-
cial policy, the Constitution of
WSUA, and the laws of New York
State..." and proposed that
WSUA's budget be immediately
frozen; that WSUA must cancel all
services as of midnight Sept. 24;
that all equipment, supplies, and
other materials belonging to S.A.
be immediately inventoried and
locked; that all keys and other
instruments of access be im-
mediately turned over to the Pre-
sident of S.A.; that Council ap-
point a committee to immediately
investigate the whole operation of
WSUA, i.e., past, present, and
future; and that before any futher
action is taken concerning WSUA,
that this committee report back
to council. Wnsserman went on to
list the alleged WSUA actions that
precipitated the introduction of
his bill. He alleged the overspendi-
ng of 3 budget lines, totaling over
$600, the transference of monies
from one line to another, totaling
$5,000, without Finance Commit-
tee's authorization, failure to get
competitive bids on purchases of
items costing over $500, reusing
income without permission, all in
violation of Finance policy, for-
gery on money vouchers and sev-
eral other violations. Any one of

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

the “ ‘l-u-n-‘l .‘ ' " calls
for freezing of a group’s budget.

Discussion centered on the ques-
tion of whether or not it would be
more harmful than beneficial to
the University community to
freeze WSUA's budget. In an ef-
fort to reach a solution suitable to
all, Professor Bernard Johnpoll
introduced an amendment to the
bill that WSUA be allowed to
continue to operate, but as of
midnight Sept. 24, 1970, all
operations of WSUA will be under
the control of a committee select-
ed by Council. The bill finally
passed Council in its amended
form 1638.

In other business Council estab-
lished an ad hoc committee on
student security. The committee
will “have the powers, upon stu-
dent request, involving investiga-
tion of sources of imminent
threats to students' persons, indi-
vidual liberties and property.‘ It
will look into possible violations
of civil liberties of students and
report back to Council. The bill,
also, requested the cooperation of
the Campus Security Department
in the committee‘s activities.

Finally, Council voted to sup-
port the 1ndian Quad petition
(signed by about 150 residents of
that quad) which requested a re-
ducl’on in their housing bill. The
residents of the quad cited the
lack of services and incon~
veniences they must endure as the
basis for this bill. Residents of
that quad pay the same room and
board charges as do all campus

Draft Counseling

The following is a series of questions and answers regarding the
Draft Counseling Scruicc recently set up by Sludenl Association.

Q: What is draft counseling?

A: Draft counseling is aimed at making available to all draft age men
vital information pertaining to their draft status and possible
alternatives to military service. We do not counsel ‘drainodging,’
the aim is to utilize the wide provisions of the law as regards to
options in and out of the military.

Q: When can I get counseled?

A: There is now a schedule of hours when counseling is available.
One schedule is located at the CC Information Desk, another
schedule is posted outside the SA office. Over 20 hours of
counseling per week, during the day and at night, are now available.

Q: Can I contact draft counselors by phone?

A: Yes, the draft counseling office has a phone-ul57-4009. In
addition, each counselor will have his individual number available to
his advisees.

Q: What if there is no one there when I need help?

A: There is u sign-up sheet in the Draft Counseling office where
anyone can write their name and number down, and they will be
contacted shortly.

Q: I am qualiﬁed to be a counselor. Can I help?

A: Yes. Qualified counselors are needed urgently. There is a sign-up

sheet in the Draft Counseling office which suites for only qualified
counselors who are willing to donate four hours per week to
