Danes Oust Formidable

by Dave Fink

Albany State is finally making a
name for itself on the soccer field.

Under the guidance of coach Bill
Schieffelln, the Great Danes
whipped one of the strongest
teams in New England, Castleton
State, 2-0, this past Saturday.

The first half of the game was
scoreless as both teams missed

AMIA

In League 1 action this past
Tuesday, ALC and Potter Club
played to a 14-14 deadlock. On
Thursday, APA shut out GDX,
27-0, while front-running STB
edged KB 14-6.

After almost two weeks of play
the races in Leagues I, II, and III
are beginning to take shape.

Currently, in League I, STB
holds a substantial lead and ap-
pears to be a very strong contend-
er for the championship. ALC's
chances of moving up into con-
tention, will be determined in the
coming week when they oppose
STB twice. If APA and EEP re-
main within tackling distance of
STB for the next three weeks,
they will both have shots at first
place, as STB’s final two match-
ups are with these two teams.
Don't be surprised, though, if it
all narrows down to the last game
on October 24-1 showdown for
the League [crown-matching the
STB and APA powerhouses. As of
Sept. 25 the standings in League I
looked like this:

STB 4 0 0 8
EEP 2 1 1 5
ALC 1 1 2 4
APA 2 2 0 4
cm 1 2 1 3

some fine opportunities to score.
According to Coach Schieffelin,
goaltender John Thayer played
the finest game of his career and
probably the best performance
the coach has seen of any goalie in
a long time. "Castleton could have
easily scored four or five goals had
it not been for John,“ Schieffelin
added.

In League II, both TXO and BPS
have perfect records and will meet
head on on Oct. 8 to determine
league supremacy.

Turning to League Ill, there are
five tennis bunched at the top of
the standings and it seems likely
that there will be a five team
scramble for first place.

As of Sept. 25, this is the way
the teams stood:

17:35 of the third period when
center halfback Fred Campbell
was fouled in the penalty area.
The rules state that this type of
infraction calls for a penalty kick
and forward Demetrios Michael
promptly deposited the ball in the
Castleton net to make the score
1-0 in favor of the Danes. The
score remained the same for the
reminder of the third quarter as
Castlcton missed two great chanc—
es to tally when shots struck the
goal posts instead of going in.
With only twenty seconds to

'Castleton, 2-0

play in the encounter, forward
Ron Spratt kicked the ball loose
from the hands of the home team
goalie and Michael again was
Johnny on the spot, being right
there to put it in.

This type of break, along with
those two shots that hit the posts,
are an example of just what part
luck plays in a game like soccer.
Last year‘s team was it very strong
one but an incredible number of
bad breaks tlnd wasted opportu-
nities led to a 1-7-3 season. This
year seems to be a different story.

Fall Baseball Shows

only biiserunners of the game. it
was a near perfect outing for
Quinn, who looks like he‘ll be
doing some nice things on the
pitcher‘s mound over the next
three years.

In the past, Albany‘s basic prob-
lem has been hitting and pitching.
This season, fielding looks to be
added to the list, but hopefully
pitching can be crossed off. Dane
fielders committed two errors last
Saturday and four big ones against
Siena Wednesday. Against Le-
Moyne last week, they made three
in the first game and were able to
squeeze in five more in the second
game, before it was called in the
sixth. That adds up to 14 errors,
which adds up to a lot of the
enemies running around the bases,
who really shouldn‘t be there.

On the plus side, Hiland Doolit-
tle, who was the ace of the mound
staff last year, looks like he'll be
fairly steady once again for State.
Quinn and he counld spell a rather
respectable 1-2 punch to solve
some of the pitching problems.

The squad is capitalizing on these
opportunities and consequently
adding that important extra that
is needed in order to make good
soccer winning soccer.

This win, according to Schief-
felin, “showed the team that they
can play top caliber soccer teams
and win." Victories like this one,
early in the season, not only add
up in the win column, but also
add to the pride and confidence

of the squad.

Coach Schieffelin has stated that
to one man can be singled out in
accounting for the team’s success
thus far. He credits the fine play
of senior captain Joel Volinski
and freshman Bruce Ackerman on
defense and Nick Ascienzo and
transfer Fred Campbell at half-
back iis being instrumental in the
team‘s two victories to date. He
especially commended Campbell
on completely controlling the
play in midfield, one of the most
vital areas in a soccer game.

This Saturday, the Danes host
Harpur College at 2:00 p.m. The
Colonials are a very strong team
and boast the services of Richy
Stormsgard, a forward from Fin-
land, who is very definitely a
candidate for All American hon-
ors this year. According to Schief-
felin, if State can control him, the
chances of victory are very great.

State I Loses RPI Scrimmage;

Early Fumbles
Proved Costly

by Mike Piechowicz

The Albany State Football Club
met its first opponent on a foot-
ball field Friday, in a pre-season
scrimmage with the R.P.I. fresh-
man squad. R.P.I. outscored 'the
Great Danes, 26-12.

The curious onlookers who
filled the bleachers and dotted the
hillside were treated to an early
glimpse of the team that will carry
their colors in thefall. Overall the
Danes appeared shaky and uncer-
tain of themselves, but they had
their moments of glory as well.
The defensive “mini-line" met
with the solid approval of the
onlookers when it repeatedly
threw back R.P.I. rushes. Forced
to turn to the air, however, the
RP]. offense began to roll. AI-
bany’s offense, on the other hand,
spent part of the afternoon trying
to hold onto the football, al-
though the situation seemcd to be
remedied to an extent in the
second half.

R.P.l. scored the first time they
got the ball. They bobblcd the
kick-off on their goal line, and for
a minute it looked as if Albany
State would get an early break.
The ball carrier recovered, how-
ever, and the Engineers started
from their eighteen yard line. The
first two plays from scrimmage
were unsuccessful rushes into the
left side of the Albany line. Faced
with a third down and eightsituuv
tion, the RPI. quarterback faked
a hand-off into the line and rifled
a pass over the right side. When
the play was whistled dead, the

 
   

t Ford‘s chagrin.

. ball was on the Albany forty-five
with a first down. The defense
then held to the fourth down,
when another pass was good for a
first down at the State thirty.
Eight plays and two completed
passes later, the score stood six to
nothing in favor of the visitors.

With a somewhat less than auspi-
cious start behind the defense, the
offensive unit took the field with
the ball on its thirty-two yard line
following the kick-off. The first
play from scrimmage was a hand-
off from quarterback Bill Flana-
gun to Bernie Boggs, that looked
good, but went nowhere. The
second play signalled the end for

Priorities, a sense of values, are an importaiil part of our existiincc.
They come into play in the allotment of our time, our energies, and
our monies. Obviously, the rational way of deciding just how we will
divide these things is determined by how much good we can, in fact,
do. it follows that we try touchich the most with what we have.

A concerted attempt is made to provide competent officiating. AMIA

desire to be innovative, has attempted to keep abreast of current
procedures and methods by belonging to the National intramural
Association for the past ten years. In short, AMIA understands its role

conservative estimate of $3,500 for officials alone (this being their
foremost expenditure). In total, they have asked for $1,270.00. This

the offensive unit when the ball
popped loose and was covered by
a red shirted R.P.I. man on the
Danes 30 yard line. As if to taunt
the Albany defense, RPI. wasted
a. down and then took the ball
thirty yards on a run to move the
score to twelve nothing. With
their opening curtain jitters be-
hind them, the Danes settled
down to playing an unsettled
game of football.

Albany was forced to punt on
its next series of downs, and Jon
Getbehcad boomed a forty-eight
yarder that put RPI. on its own
twenty-two. On a third down
play, the Engineers fired a pass
over the right side of its line that
corncrback Dave Benedict knifed
in front of to intercept and return
to the twenty. Albany, given a
golden opportunity to get back in
the game, promptly gave the ball
away on a blown reverse play that

gain and a first down in the second lmlf, much to State Coach Bob

led to a fumble. Throughout the
game Albany was plagued'with
minor slips and mental errors that
stopped State drives or allowed
RPI. advances. A leaky second-
ary and uncertain open field
tackling turned five and ten yard
gains into twenty yard gallops.
But the errors they made were

those made by every inex-
perienced squad and will be
ironed out with practice and

actual game experience. The raw
materials are there for a solid
club. Only time will tell how
solid.

The second half went pretty
much the some as the first, with
RPI. rolling up the final score of
itwenty~six to twlcve. The State

turn for the better when quarter-
back Gordie Kuppcrstein brought

With the showing they made Fri-

for a successful rookie year at the
helm of the Great Dane football
club. The squad has no out-
stnading weaknesses other than
relative inexperience, and the
showing against R.P.I. was even
more impressive considering that
