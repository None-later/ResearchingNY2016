Louis T. Benezel:
The Man, The Issues

by .I. Stephen Flavin
An ASP Feature

“When things get out of control,
do you let disruptions and
violence go through? Or, do you
haul things into line?"

A rhetorical question? Louis T.
Benezet may someday have to
answer his own question.
President of the State University
of New York at Albany since July
1, 1970, Dr. Benezet approaches
the $38,000 a year post with
nearly 30 years of administrative
experience.

“To use off-campus police to
quell disruptions would be an
extreme measure, an admission of
defeat...defeat for the entire uni-
versity community. Students have
the right to demonstrate
peacefully, to communicate, and I
am ready anytime to meet with
sincere students."

“Students’ rights to privacy
must be respected. This adminis-
tration will not hound studen'ts to
act as informers. Resident Assis-
tants, Deans, people over whom I
have control will respect others'
rights and our employees will

respect a ‘no-knock’ policy on this
campus."

“Drugs bother me. The use of
narcotics, including marijuana, is
still a felony and can't be passed
off lightly. It’s not so much the
indulgence, but the dependence
upon drugs to escape reality." The
dependence on some drugs is en-
slaving and a hindrance to con-
structive problem solving. “If the
use of drugs comes to the
attention of the administration
and authorities, we can't look the
other way and they have to act. I
can't tell the outside authorities
v.hat to do, but I would be
disturbed by an outside raid.”

To maintain order within the
university community, Dr.
Benezet feels that channels of
communication must remain
open, open to all individuals or
groups on every rung of the uni-
versity's hierarchy. He intends to
exchange information every other
week in an open forum. -

“No man can know all. I am not
the one calling all the shots. Presi-
dent’s press conferences tend to
magnify the role of the president

Middle East Forum
Ends in Heated Debate

bv Jerry Price

Although the Middle East is in
complete turmoil, therd are in-
dications that Jews and Arabs can
coexist peacefully if not work
together for common goals.

There are still grave problems in
this part of the world that may
very will worsen and this was
brought out by the forum on
Middle East troubles held last
night. The Forum was initiated
by the May 1st Student Strike
Committee in an attempt to air
conﬂicting views on the con-
troversial subject,

Bashir Khadra spoke convin-
cingly as a Palestinian whose own
family was thrown out of what is
now Israel by Israeli authorities.
Mr. Khadra denounced the state
of Israel as “an expansionist and
imperial nation." He felt that
most of the Palestinians not only
found themselves homeless, but
also found themselves totally
humiliated and at a loss as to
vhat to do next.

Saml Khasawinah spoke briefly
from the point of View of a native
Jordanian. He was horrified at the
refugee living conditions that he
encountered. There is no doubt,
accordin to the s eaker that it

 

 

was not a question of civil war.
Most Jordanians sympathized
with the Palestinian cause. King

The greatest portion of the
forum was spent in question and
answer fashion. Zionists confront:
ed the Arab speakers with a mul-
titude of questions. Why did
Arabs terrorize the Jews who
settled in Palestine before the
state of Israel was even in exis-
tence? Specific instances were
cited beginning with 1922 and
continuing through 1987.

Some people were concerned
with the question of who had the
first and best claim to the land ol
Palestine. A few individuals in the
audience cited the Old Testament
as proof that the chs were pro-
mised the land in question. It
should be noted, though, that the
Old Testament makes mention of
the fact that the ancient Hebrews
conquered the Caananites, the
original inhabitants. The speakers
tried to explain that they as,
Arabs were actually descended
from the Canaanites, Philistines,
and other ancient tribes. "Arab"

is a cultural term, they pointed
out--not a description of a race of
people.

and not the roles of other key
administrators. Top men in the
administration may know more in
their respective fields than I could
ever know. We must be ready to
speak on policy, for what we
think is related to what will
happen."

“Weekly converences are too
confining, redundant. Every other
week, I and other men in the
administration will be regularly
available in an open forum to
exchange ideas, discuss problems
and to let out air pressures. I‘ll
take my raps; I don’t like to send
someone else. The forums are not
likely to be disappointing.

“Members of the university
must define our own goals. We
must use student powers and
faculty powers more effectively.
Granted, there will be disa-
greements, but we must agree on a
reasonable order of priorities, and
complete them. “

search panel consisting of two.

undergraduates, one graduate stu-
dent, three administrators and
two faculty members. The board,
as it stands now, is composed of
David Anderson (the graduate
student), Sorrell Chesin, Seth
Spellman, Robert Stierer, Regis
Devel, Torin Baritz, Joe Kaiser,
and Jeff Wasserman.

The question of membership led
to some early disagreements.
Originally, no undergraduates
were included. In fact, the board
operated for over a month and
passed through about one-third of
the applications on this basis.

President Benezct came on the
scene and pushed for undergra-
duate representation, acting on
the request of the president and
vice-president of Student
Association.

One administrator is parti-
cular—Dr. Milton Olsenwas
opposed to the move. As
Vice-President for Management
and Planning he is second only to
the President of the University as
far as running security is con‘
cerncd.

Benezet, however, had final say
and the committee recessed for a
month until undergraduates re-
turned for the fall semester.

By the time this recess occurred,
judgment had been passed on
about thirty applicants.

Since undergraduates were
added, the board has met three
times and has rated about one-half
of the eighty to ninety applicants.
An "A" rating means the candi-
tliitc receives iin interview. “8"
indicates further research is neces-
sury before an interview will be
granted. A “(3" rating is tnntii-
mount to a rejection.

rated candidates thus far luch

cially those of Southeast Asia

job, according to Central Admini-
stration guidelines, is a two-year
college degree.

The search board met on its own
and upped the requirement to
four years. This action was taken
before the inclusion of undergra-
duates.

Student government leaders,
appraising the entire security
situation, offer the following as
areas of concern:

—Had it not been for the direct
intervention of President Benezet,
the make-up of the search board
would have been markedly conser-
vative, and without undergraduate
representation.

—As it is, some of the more
liberal members are complaining
of problems in notification. In
one case, a secretary misplaced a
student's telephone number and
he was not notified of a meeting.
Another student was notified of
the same meeting one and one-
half hours after it began. "I would
say that the administration is not
insuring proper notification of all
members," was the way one mem-
ber phrased it.

—As security chief, Jumcs
Connully opposed the keeping of
name and picture files of student
activists. This has brought him
into conflict with administrators
in the past. Will this policy change
under a director who has a history
of military intelligence?

A Counterbalance

To counterbalance thcse sup-
posed "threats," Central Council
hiis, over the past two chks,
piisscd two bills.

The first dealt with the
establishment of ii rcvicw agency
to oversee security operations. It
was introduced by Student Asso-
ciation President Diivc Ni-ul'eld's
cabinet.

Niiufcld hiimcll' introduch a
bill at the lust council session
calling for an “ad hoc comiiiittcc
on student sccurity," which
would investigate “sources of

imminent threats to students‘ per.
sons, individual liberties and
property." The whole question of
student files would come under
this committee’s jurisdiction.

So far, there has been no
administrative reaction.

The amount of concern ex-
pressed seems warranted since
trends are already apparent at
two of Albany‘s sister schools.

The Stony Brook student news-
paper, Tlic Statesman, reported
that a letter was sent from the
Office of the Executive Vice
President to an officer in the army
military police asking for the
names of qualified, retired mili-
tary policeman who might be
interested in the director’s post at
Stony Brook.

And at SUNY Buffalo, President
Robert Kettcr recently announced
the appointment of Kenneth P.
Glennon as security chief.

“Mr, Glennon‘s background and
qualifications are uniquely suited
to solving the special problems of
security on our (the U.B) cam-
pus," Kettcr said in making the
appointment.

Dr. Ketter did not mention that
Glennon's “background and quali-
fications" include 31 years of
service (1938 to 1969) with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Day Care
Site Protest

by Kathy Kelley

Residents of Pierce Hall, on the
Downtown Campus, are dissatis-
fied with the living conditions in
their dorm, particularly over the
location of the Day Care Center in
the basement. Construction taking
place in setting up the Center and
the adjustments being made for
the changeover of the hall from a
classroom set-up to a residence
hall were also cited as particular
grievances by the students.

Complaints of Pierce Hall stu-
dents about the Day Care Center
include use of the residence for
something other than residence
purposes and the disturbance
caused now by construction and
ultimately by the opcrzition of the
Day Care Center itself.

To alleviate the problem of
noise originating in the Center,
various measures are being taken
in construction of the facility:
installation of acoustical tile ceil-
ings; laying of rugs in the halls and
on the stairs; installation of doors
and partitions to separate the Cen-
ter from the rest of the hall.

In addition to the construction
taking place for the Day Care
Center, repairs and improvements
are being made in connection with
the switch of Pierce Hall from an
academic building, housing the
School of Social Welfare to a
residence hall. Adjustments such
as the installation of sprinklers in
the stiiirwclls are still taking place
because the decision to convert
Picrcc llnll into n rcsidcnco hall
was made late in the your and
construction therefore did not be-
gin until August 17, allowing only
two weeks until Pierce l-iall resi-
dents begun to move into a dorm
only nearly completed, with con-
struction now taking place for the
crciition of the Day Care Center as
well.

Because of the inconvenience
and disturbance of construction
and the curtain facilities, such as ll
laundry, the possibility of some
sort of compensation to Pierce
Hull residents has been brought
up. This compensation would pro-
bubly be in the form of a refund.
No definite steps, however, have
as yet been taken.

Residents of Indian
Unsatisfied with Quad

by Steve Salant

“Reduce our housing bills be-
cause we as a quad do not receive
the same services as other quads,"
this is the gist of a petition from
the residents of Indian Quad-
rangle. Central Council, on Thurs-
day, September 24, passed a bill
stating that they supported the
quad ’s petition.

Indian Quad, the newest quad-
rangle on the campus, is still
under construction thereby cau-
sing obvious problems for its resi-
dents. Michacl F'rnnk, initiator of
the original petition, claimed that
his first experience in Indian Quad
“was being woken up at 6:30 in
the morning by a construction
worker shouting at the top of his
lungs, “We gotta be quiet not to
wake the college boys." Besides

a preliminary report on the future

warns.

The full study, prepared by Pro-

of a broad topic ' “Administra-

President llcnczct has the ulti-
mate responsibility however, to
nominate to the University Coun-
cil and the SUNY Board of Trua-
tous now appointh for each post.

   

Not the least of the problems
cited would be the creation of a
new police jurisdiction on campus
and an emphasis toward stictcr
law enforcement in all areas.

Professor Brown‘s report sug-
gests a number of controversial
alternatives including the creation
of a civilian overview panel, ii
moving away from the law en-
forcement trend toward which
security is heading, and rccamping
of the powers of the new security
director.

Another Polico Agency

The report mentions to what
extent the campus poliCc force, in
keeping with a statewide trend, is
being changed'upgrudcd by the
creation of a new “Director of
Security" position.

Funds have been approved for
five “Security Specialists," which
would be similar in function to
security John
llcnighun.

"A major problem that appears
in this change," the report warns,
“is that although the Central Ad-
ministration executiVes appear to

l

investigator

/

be sincere in their desire to crcutt
a non-militaristic, service-oriented
security organization...tlie pro»
gram that has been initiated
would lead almost inevitably to
the SUNYA Security Force be
coming another police agency.“

This is highlighted by the fact
that the new Director will be
responsible for enforcing all fed~
crul, state and local statutes.

According to the study, the new
police jurisdiction on campus
lcnds to the establishment of a
professional police image with its
resultant problems.

functions to mesh in with the
general law enforcement trends."

the noise due to the construction,
there is the inconvenience of no
ventilation in the bathrooms, peri-
odic shutoffs of heat and hot
water, the heavy machinery in the
quad and a lack of landscaping,
creatingwhat Steve Roizen, one of
the R.A. s for the quad, called “a
veritable dust bowl."

Residents also complained about
the lack of curtains and screens on
the windows. This combined with
the lack of security for the dorm
(no lock-box or metal doors) led
Michael Friedman, Residence Dir-
ector for the quad, to tell this
reporter that anyone could enter
the building at any time. Recent-
ly, two vending machines were
smashed in one of the main halls
and because of the lack of securi-
ty anyone at the university could
have committed the crime.

In addition to these grievances,
there is also the absence of dry
cleaning and eating facilities, and
there is no close and easily access—
ible parking lot. The most impor-
tant need is for more fire exits
since at the moment there are too
few, creating fire hazards, and in
the lower lchl of the dorms there
is much exposed electrical equip-
ment.

Michael Frank drew up a peti-
tion listing these complaints and
brought it to the Student Associa-
tion. Mike Lampert, Vice presi-
dent of the Central Council, sent
the petition to Dave Peck of the
Grievance Committee. DiiVe Peck
and Dick Wesley, member of Con-
tral Council and an R.A. for In—
dian Quad, formulated the bill.
During the Central Council meet-
ing of September 24, 50 residents
of Indian Quad wa tchcd as the bill
was passed. The bill urged the
Housing and State Dormitory Au-
thority to reconsider Indian
Quad's room rates. Ralph Beisler,
Assistant Dean of Student Life is
now preparing the background
work to present the bill to the
State Dormitory Authority.

The passage of the bill has
caused much conflict between stu-
dent hopcs and Administrative
