TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1970

by Harry Weiner

CRISIS 5300 (DIAL 46745300),
SUNYA‘s very own 7day, 24~
hour referral phone service for
“almost any problem that might
affect a college student" held an
open meeting last Tuesday night,
amidst an air of cautious opti-
mism for the year ahead. An
outgrowth of last year's spring
dialogue, CRISIS will probably
face many of the same problems
that are plaguing all of the campus
ﬂCtIVIIICS‘d lack of adequate
funds and facilities with which to
operate.

Now located in CC 335 (as one
girl termed it “a nice closet with a
red desk"), CRISIS hopes to be in
operation within the next few
weeks. According th a member of
last year‘s staff, one of CRISIS'
major problems will be to create a
new image. "Last spring CRISIS
served as everything from a strike
information center to a first aid
station," she remarked. Yet, this
isn't why CRISIS was established
and this is not what CRISIS hopes
to handle. As an overall student-
oriented service, CRISIS hopes to
be able to offer a kind word and a
listening ear to any problem, large
or small.

Helping All With

Training for the CRISIS staff is
minimal, as is the screening pro-
cess for those who work on the
phones. In the few short weeks
that CRISIS was in operation last
year, the range of calls and the
problems put forth were so varied
it was obvious that no one meth-
od of training could prepare any-
one for every situation. Experi-
ence will serve as the best method
of preparation, though the staff
will be working with a prepared
manual in order to recommend
further sources of assistance, such
as medical and psychiatric care.
CRISIS, however, is not a profes-
sional organization—it cannot give
answers to every problem. CRISIS
is someone to talk to—someone
you can level with when there’s
no one else to turn to.

Attempts have been made to
secure a lounge in the Campus
Center which will be open all
night. This would be a place
where people could go and talk
out their problems as they would
over the phone. So far, the major
snag has been the inability to get
someone “in charge" such as a
graduate student to remain in the
Campus Center for security and

Schmidt, acting director of the
infirmnry.

’I‘hc outbrcak of strep throat on
campus was not an epidemic, as
some people thought. It was
brought quickly under control
through the use of preventive
treatment, which consisted most<
Iy of penicillin shots. Dr. Schmidt
said that the “cooperation on
campus was tremendous and

It is still possible to get strep

The role of the Board of Trus-
tees and of New York State invol-
ving mandatory tax is a crucial
problem. If the state enforces
mandatory tax, should it have
complete control over these mon—
ies?

Dave Ncufcld, President of Stu-
(lcnt Association, commented that
the Trustees should be limited to
‘ fiscal responsibilities" but “the
easiest out is n non-state tux. ‘ He
referred to a “community con-
cept“ in which the members of
the community would tnx them-
selves.

The Student Association is pre-
paring to present their budget and
is confident that “if President
Benczct has the authority the
budch will be approved."

According to Neul‘cld, “any ac-
tion concerning the SA suit will
have a definite effect on other
universities." The Presidents of
U.B,, Stony Brook, Oncontn nnd
Oswcgo were among those who
have met with Chancellor Boyer.
llowcvcr, thcsc Presidents l'must
try to see eye to eye" before
anything will be accomplished.

Dave Ncufcld stated that 'Wc
must push as hard us we can to
maintain student control of stu-
dent funds.“ 'I‘lul Student Associa-
tion hopes to become in "prof
il-mnking corporation that can do-
nntc profits to student activities. '

supervisory reasons. This idea is
still under discussion, but the
CRISIS staff hopes to have all
arrangements made by the time
the phoneline goes into service.

In order to operate on a full-
time schedule, CRISIS will need
between 45 and 60 people on
their staff who will be able to sit
phone duty. At the first meeting
about 35 people showed up, some
of whom were R.A.‘s and dorm
directors who came to offer their
assistance. CRISIS needs more
people, however, if it hopes to
operate 24 hours a day.

Walinsky
Speaks

by Julian Matthias

Adam Wolinsky, in the first of
several forums designed to bring
political candidates to Albany
State, "exposed" himself to about
300 students on Tuesday.

Adam Walinsky, a Democrat, is
running against incumbent Louis
Lefkowitz for Attorney General,
the chief law enforcement office
in the state.

After warming up the audience
with some anti-administration hu-
mor, he questioned the serious
ness of people in their pledges of
support to various causes. Adam
Walinsky reminded students of his
prior concern over the unfair em-
ployment practices of the con-
struction companies building on
our campus, and that there has
been absolutely no change con-
ccrning minority group employ-
ment.

Adam Walinsky attributcd the
breakdown of law and order pri-
innrily to both lnw cnforccmcnt’s
failure to protect the discriminat-
cd, and the indifference and cor-
ruption of the law cnl'orccrs, If
the pcoplc are not protected,
there is no reason to assume that
they will obey it, “All too often,
theI problems in the ghetto are
ignored until they reach Scarsdulc
or Huntington," snid Wnlinsky.

Adam Wnlinsky spoke of the
failure to enforce existing labor
laws. In a random sample of I40
on-thc-job deaths, 58 were due to
violations of laws designed to pro-
tect the worker. Of these 58
inexcusable deaths, thcrc was not
one prosecution for what could be
considered negligent homicide. If
elected, he promised to end this.

Wulinsky, in order touchich the
chnngcs needed in attitude nnd
consciousness, promised, if clcct-

cd, to:
I. not approve construction con-
tracts, unless" fair employment

practices were followvd.

2. stop industrial pollution by
lhrcntcning to shut down violntv

present abortion law, he feels thnt
the 211 week limit on ubortionr
should be changed.

Key State Role

by Bob Warner
Associate News Editor

“I will be involved in every
aspect of state government as
much as the governor will be." So
said Basil Paterson, the nominee
of the Democrats, that the role of
the Lieutenant Governor should
be more prominent than it has
been under Malcolm Wilson.

Paterson, who spoke to a group
of students on campus last
Tuesday, stresscd both the need
for in progressive and humnnc
Lieutenant Governor as well as a
forceful and dynamic stntc leader.
“Hopefully I won't be an invisible
mun,“

Furthcrmorc, the Harlem State
Senator stressed what he hoped
his future rolc would be should he
be elected. “I intend, and it has
bccn ngrccd by Arthur Goldberg,
that I will be involved in the
formation of commissions. "

Itcgnrding endorsements, Senn-
tor Paterson “wholeheartedly and
vigorously supports the candidacy
of Richard OLtingcr,” the Demo-
cratic candidate for the US. Sen-
ntc. Of Charles Goodell, Ottingcr's
Republican rival, hc said that the
Senator is “nliknblc and decent
man,“ but he‘s heard
Goodell address himself to a state
issue. I don't want a US. Senator
who takes ordcrs from n governor
to stay away from state affairs."

"never

Paterson, who stated that one-
tenth of our soldiers in Vietnam
were New Yorkers, has been a
strong opponent of the war since
1967 when he first came to
Albany.

Although he is against the legal-
ization of marijuana, he has intro-
(luccd a bill into the State Senate
that will make the use of mari-
juana an offense instead of a
crime, so that students” records
will not be scarred for life.
Furthermore,he said that it is
"very hypocritical to prosecute
when we don‘t know its effects."
