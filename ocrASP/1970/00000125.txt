New University Conference

New Protest Plan

by Candy Carallaro

Students wishing to activate rad-
ical ideas were encouraged Tues-
day by David Levitt to work
through the New University Con-
fernece, as an alternative to for-
merly established methods of pro-
test.

hCViLt, N.U.C. representative tc
this area, explained that it was
organized by former members of
SDS, because of the failure of that
institution, and disillusionment
with campaigning for peace ran-
(lidatL‘s. The students found a
need for an institution on the
university level.

N.U.C. was founded in Chicago
111 the winter of 1968. The Na-
tional Convmition, which has met
each summer since then, formed
four basic programs, and dcvel»
oped a national organization.

“Moby Dick" is the fall offen-
sive to the war in Southeast Asia.
Throuin this program, N.U.C.
hopes to demonstrate that be-
cause of political graft, being
“lured into" Working for peace
candidates does not help to stop
the war. It offers students alter-
niiti- methods of protest.

To “liberate” the women of
students and faculty, N.U.C. insti-
tuted its Day Care Center pro-
gram. Since the Center is for
persons from all factions of so-
ciety, free, and client controlled,
Levitt pointed out that it also
demonstrates the human relation-
ships that would develop after a
socialist revolution iii this color
try. So far, Day Care Centers Iiave
beeii established in Bloomingdale
and in Columbia, and it. was sug»
gested that SUNYA might succeed

Pro Arab lsraeﬂ
In Speak Sunday

by llarbara Muller

A ticw proposal for pciicc iii the
Middle East will bc presented iii
an address given by Uri Avncry, a
member of llic lsracli Parliament,
on Sunday, October 11, at 1:.‘Itl in
I.(‘ lit.

Avncry, the spokesman for cs-
lnblishinciit reform and “11' youth
of Israel, has t'iiuscd iiiiicli t'iiiitro
versy by his revolutionary apr
proncli to the settlement of “11'
Middlc I‘Iiisl crisis. I‘lvcr Silli'l' the
Six Day War of 1007, he and his 5
year old pro-Aral) political party
have tlllVOCllli‘d reconciliation
with the Palestinian Arabs.

The party proposes IIIIII ii fcdcr
otioit be formed between Israel
and Palestine llllll would mutually
occupy Jerusalem as the capital,
and also mutually settle the refu-
gec problem. The basic concept
behind the federation is to en
hancc the possibilities for cvonlual
unification of Israel itiid Palestine.
and the confederation of llll the
states of the Middle East.

During World War Two, Uri
Avticry came to Israel as a rcfugcc
from llitler. Iaiter he joined the
Irguii, a terrorist organization op-
posed to the British presence in
the Middle East, and he served as
it combat soldier in his Country's

in forming one, with N.U.C.‘s

help.

High school teachers are viewed
by N.U.C. as vital allies in the
struggle against the establishment.
Therefore, a program has been
started, to “devote energies to
bring together radical high school
teachers." “Open up the School"
was initiated to deal with the
functioning of the University it-
self. Through this program,
N,U.C. hopes to establiin open
admission policies, work against
overcrowding of dorms and class-
rooms, demonstrate how grading
and teaching systems divide the
people involved, and any other
projects which are dictated by the
needs of each individual univer-
sity. In this way, hopefully the
university can be made integral to
life in America, so that people will
study and work in it, because they
chose to do so.

If Levitt succeeds in estabv
Iishing ii chapter tit Albany,
SUNYA will be the first university
in the state system in N.U.C. To
establiin a chapter of N.U.C., only
interest and the payment of dues
by several members is required.
This will entitle the university to
two representatives, one male and
one female, to the yearly coit-
ventioii, and to the publications
of N.U.C. 'l‘hcse include a news-
letter twice 11 month, reports from
other chapters, and other com-
inunicatioiis.

"The only way to stop a war is
to have a congress that wants to
stop it," said Dave Hirsch at :1
Movement for a New Congress
meeting on Tuesday night. The
Princeton based organization has
chosen about 6() “swing districts
that are vital for peace." Hirsch
and Ilollic L Hawkes, the two
leaders of the New Movement at
Albany, are concentrating their
efforts for Republir .n Dan But-
ton, and Democrats Ned Pattison
and Al Lowenstein.

Button is running against Sam
Stratton in this the 29th Congres-

ting all of the military appropria-
tions."

Pattison is running against Carl-
ton King, a Republican- incum-
bent, in the 30th Congressional
District. Lowenstein, a freshman
congressman, is running against
Republican Norman Lent, a State
Senator, for the congressional seat
in the 5th district. If there are
enough interested students, Low-
enstein Headquarters in Long Is-
land will supply huses. to get
students to Long Island for week-
end campaign work.

Cathy Bertini, President of the
Young Republicans, is the fl'll
time coordinator for Governor
Rockefeller's campaign in this re-
gion. It is her responsibility to
train campaign workers at door-
to-door and phone canvassing.
Bertini claims that the Young
Republicans are “supporting all
Republicans including US. Sena~
tor Goodell."

The New Republican Front,
which Dan Duncan, its president,
calls “the only ‘Nixon Republi-
can' club on campus, is supporting
James Buckley, not Goodell, for
U.S. Senator. Although Buckley is
the Conservative Party's candi-
date, Duncan claims he is more in
line with Nixon-Republicanism
than is Goodell, Bertini says that
Nixon doesn't necessarily repre-
sent iill Republicans.
