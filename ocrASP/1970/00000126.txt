What do the Palestinians Want?

by Michael Howard

The Arab inhabitants of Pales-
tine fled in fear for their lives in
1948 after the creation of the
state of Israel. Since then a whole
generation has grown up in the
refugee camps and in the cities
around the borders of Israel. ac-
cepted neither by Israel nor the
Arab states and ignored by the
world. With the August cease-fire.
agreed to by both Israel and the
Arab governments. the world
thought it could ease the tensions
in the Middle East without con«
sidering the plight of the Pales-
tinians. The recent hijackings, the
product of the new generation of
Palestinians. exploded these
hopes. There can be no peace in
the Middle East that does not
recognize Palestine and its right to
live.

What Do the Palestinians Want?

What do the Palestinians want',’
In general terms, the answer is
simple: they want to be allowed
to return to their homeland under
conditions of first-class citizen-
ship. This does not mean the Jews
who have recently settled there
must leave Palestine~the guerilla
organizations are quite explicit on
this point. What it means is the
formation of a secular. democratic
state in which Arabs and Jews are
equals. socially and economically
as well as before the law. 'l‘hus
Arabs must be given substantial
economic assistance in rcscttliiig

to give them the same economic
and educational opportunities as
Jews. In addition there must be an
end to the prejudicial Israeli im-
migration laws, under which any
Jew from anywhere can come and
be an Israeli citizen. These are the
basic demands of all the guerrilla
organizations.

What is important to realize
about the Palestinians' struggle is
that it goes much deeper than that
of one of Arab against Jew. The
conflict within Jordan should be
proof enough of this. But what is
true in Jordan is true everywhere
else in the Arab world. All of the
Arab states are run by small elites
who prosper while large numbers
of their countrymen barely sur-
vive. These elites OWc their pros-
perity to profits with the West.
mainly in oil. together with mili-
tary and economic aid from the
United States and the Soviet
Union. Some get more aid from
one of these giants. others from
the other; but all benefit from ii
system including both.

American Imperialism

When people speak of American
imperialism they mean this system
whereby the rich and powerful of
a country put. their country's I‘t"
sources (in men aml materials) at
the service of United States cor~
porations for their own profit and
at the expense of the deteriorating
condition of their own people. At
the same IIIIIt' these groups are
given military aid by the U.S. in
case these people rise up in rebel-

lion. To the extent that Russia
participates in this system it is
appropriate to speak of Russian
imperialism as well.

Jordan's elite is particularly tied
to the U.S.. in that its military
force is entirely maintained by the
U.S. and its economy is main-
tained by Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, the two major oil coun-
ties. Since 1948 this elite has done
its best to keep the Palestinians
weak and disorganized while at
the same time appearing to sup-
port the Palestinian cause. Now its
pretense has been exposed and it
must rely on pure terror to main-
tain its rule. having earned the
hostility of Palestinians and Jor-
danians alike.

Those elites receiving aid from
the Soviet Union—mainly Egypt.
Syria. and lraq~wi|l not be as
eager to serve the U.S. as Jordan.
but still they are part of a system
in which the U.S. plays ii large
role. Whether they are willing to
risk the destruction of their ar»
mics and their severance from the
American economic tern in
support of the Palestinians is
doubtful.

 

Popular Front

The Popular Front for the Lilr
criition of Palestine the organiza-
tion responsible for the hijack-
iiigs is already speaking in terms
of an international people's ru-
vnlution to overthrow all the es-

In the beginning Britain allowed
the creation of the state of Israel
not otit of concern for the Jewish
people but in order to establish an
ally in the Middle East with which
to protect her control over the

of the United States government.
As Israel’s economy becomes
more and more strained by the
nee any to maintain a costly
military machine, it will become
more and more at the mercy of
the political needs of the United
States government (specifically.
the Republican party) and the
economic needs of the American
empire. Its role will be that of the
protector of American oil and the
supporter of Arab military cliques
and potentates.

 

Fighting the Role

To fight this role it is he ary
for Jews in Israel to work in
solidarity with the Palestinian
guerrillas in order that their peo-
ple no longer flourish at the ex-
pense of another people and in
service to American imperialism.

People fear that Jch who work
against Israel will only be con
tributiiig to the destruction of
their own people. Against this We
must observu that the guerrillas
wliii took part in the I‘l't‘l‘lll III'
jackings were not. anti-Jewish. No
passenger returned to report any
