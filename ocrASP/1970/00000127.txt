Gridders Set For Historic Opener

by Mike Piechowicz

Baseball’s World Series takes a
back seat to football tomorrow
when the Great Danes of Albany
State meet Rochester Institute of
Technology. The game marks the
beginning of club football at
Albany and the two o’clock kick-
off should be before a packed
house, or hillside, as the case may
be.

R.I.T. is undefeated in two
starts this season and is ranked
19th in the nation among club
football teams. Their offense

takes full advantage of two fine
runners, Joe Widay and Pat
Muscarella. Widay is an impressive
outside runner who powers
sweeps with his quickness and
exceptional moves, while Musca-
rella hits the hole quickly and has
rushed for over one hundred yards
in each of Rochester’s first two
games. Quarterback Rich Knanck,
an area product, scrambles well
but passes very little. R.I.T. on
the whole seldom passes.

Last week they pulled out a

Dane Booters Lose 4-1

by Dave Fink

The Great Dane varsity soccer
team traveled to Oneonta on
Wednesday and came away on the
short endof a 4-1 margin.

The score was tied at halftime,
1-1, but the second half was the
story of the home squad out-
hustling State.

Oneonta opened the scoring at
9:26 of the first period on a goal
by Carlos Camacho, one of many
foreign born players for Oneonta.
This is, indeed, a great advantage
for them in that most of these
men have been playing soccer all
their lives instead of going down
to the neighborhood playground
to shoot baskets.

State tied the score at 10:50 of
the second quarter when Larry
Herzog took a pass from team-
mate John Streeter and sent the
ball skidding past the futile lunge
of the lndian's goaltender.

Streeter was moved up from the
junior varsity just two days before
the Oneonta game and obviously
was able to hold his own on the
varsity.

Camacho broke the tie at 3:16
of the third period and then
added another marker at 13:21 of
the same stanza. This gave the
Oneonta forward the coveted
“hat trick," signifying the accom-
plishment of scoring three goals in
one game.

The home squad's Mario Bianchi
added the fourth Oneonta goal
midway through the fourth quart-
er but the outcome was, by this
time, no longer really in doubt.

According to Coach Bill
Schieffelin, the team's problems
are quite evident. I‘We're not play-
ing together.We have trouble con-
trolling the ball at midfield and
thus theopposing team has posses-
sion in our end too often." He
added that besides the fact that
they were more aggressive and
consequently, on this day any-
way, a better team, the Danes
made too many mistakes. It is
well known that the team which
makes the fewest errors stands the
best chance of winning.

Schieffelin doesn't feel that the
team is improving. Naturally, it is
easier for a man to make progress
when his spirits are high and two
consecutive losses does not help
morale.

This Saturday, the Danes host
New Paltz. The visitors, are, stated
Schieffelin, “man for man, the
best team in the State University
conference and probably the best
team we‘ll meet all year." State

lost a 4-3 squcckcr at New Paltz
last year and since their personnel
has: changed little since last sea-
son, the Danes stand a good
chance of knocking off the south
erncrs.

14-12 win over Plattsburgh with a
TD. toss in the final 30 seconds
of play. That throw was the first
R.I.T. touchdown pass in three
years. Physically, they’re a small
team that averages out to about
190 pounds on both lines. On
defense they have a standout in
senior middle line- backer Bob
Peters. Stopping this man could
be the key to Albany State put-
ting some points on the score-
board.

On the home side of the ledger,
Albany could very well upset
highly ranked R.I.T. State’s
“forte” in its two scrimmages was
defending against the rush. Elim-
inating the ground attack will
reduce Rochester to little more
than tackling dummies, and the
difficulties the Danes have had
defending against the pass should
be neutralized by R.l.T.’s limited
passing game.

Starting .1: the backﬁeld for
State will be Bill Flanagan at
quarterback, Rudy Vido at full-
back, Larry Petersen in the swing-
buck position, and co-captain
Bernie Boggs at tailback.

The defensive line, which must
,stop the R.I.P. backﬁeld if State is
to stay in the game, will bStevc
Finn and Marty Levi at tackles,
wiht Butch McGuerty and John
Soja holding down the ends. Finn,
however, will need medical clear-
ance to play tomorrow. Several
weeks ago he suffered a slight
concussion and his starting status
is questionable. The loss of Finn
would be a hard blow to Albany
as Coach Ford calls him, “...perh'
aps our best defensive lineman."

Offensively, Albany State will
“try to establish Vido inside, try
to control the middle linebacker
Peters, and then throw the bull a
little more than We did against
Middlebury," stuted Couch Ford.

The game boils down to Albany
beating a rugged defense and stop-
ping R.l.T.'s one-two punch of
Muscarella and Widuy.

When October 10th becomes the
memory of a well spent autumn
afternoon, and one team is revel-
ing in victory while another is
sulking in defeat, Albany State’s
first football game will be a thing
of the past. The physical and
mental errors that cropped up as
if from nowhere will be drilled
upon and drilled upon until they
are no longer a cause for concern,
so they can try it again next week.

Albany is a new team, and one

thing a new team is sure to have
more than their share ois mis-
takes. It‘s almost as if there were a
set number of errors to be com-
mitted on a given Saturday, and
better teams are exempt from
many by virtue of their superior-
ity. Somebody has to take up the
slack. Albany State has been
working since last year to keep
from being that somebody. To-
morrow we find out just how
hard.

Sailing Club

State University at Albany
hosted the first Women’s Sports
Institute held in the east on Octo-
ber 2,3, and 4. Some 170 women
coaches and officials of volleyball
and basketball participated. High
schools and colleges in 12 states

The institute is sponsored by the
Eastern District of the Division of
Girls’ and Women's Sports, a sec-

icut College are co-chairmen of
the institute. Claudette DeLama-

a combination of visual and liter-

showed the sure handed control
of a promising new auteur.

sorry scenario, erratic editing, ill’ld
the incredible stur combination of
Raquel Welch, John Huston, Rex
Reed and the indomitabchch
Wcsl.

Snrnc attempts to repeal. the
rapid puce of n Thirties' musical
comedy that distinguished his first
effort. The banal performances,
coupled with the lurid dialogue,
provo, however, that a blue movie
cannot be disguised with tech-
nicolor, no matter how much Hol-
lywood gloss it's dipped into.

Plot development is almost
non-existent and the inhuman
treatment of trunssexuulity is de-
gruding and vicious. Myra is the
fulfillment of all of Myron's
dreams. Myron is a sissified
psychotic whose vindictive aim is
to destroy the “myth of American
Manhood." Myron gets geldcd,
but the only ones getting screwed
are members of the audience.

This fluffy Frcudiunism fronts
for a story line that is one long
strcnm of one-line obscenitics and
double entendrcs that are com-
pletely devoid of humor and sub-
tlcly.

Raquel Wclch is better than her
uvcrngc scxpot self in the title
role, but her bitchy, clipped diu-
loguc is pure snobbery. John “us-
[on overdocs the leering, dirty old
mun bit as Unclc Buck Loner. Rex
Reed, the film critic turned uctor,
plays Myron, proving that he
knows us much about acting as he

and her hard mouth. Yet, despite
a few funny lines and her attempt
to rise above the muck, the Queen
of swagger is caught in the quag-
mire like cvcryone else.

As for technique, Surne's style
is devoid of any freshness, aban-
doning camera movement for te—
dious, static positions. He finally
hits bottom by editing film clips
from great comedies, dramas and
musicals of the Thirties and early
Fortics to further disjoint an ill-
ready pointless movie. The trage-
dy is that the older clips add
quality and humor to Surnc's
shredded mess.

The purpose of true satire is to
exaggerate and mock. It is usually
vulgar, funny and sarcastic, but
always subtle. Evidently, Surne
and Vidle have not learned that
transsexuals and practitioners of
kinky sex are human beings.

They are not all self destructive
and actually do enjoy life. And
despite the fact that life is n
four-letter word, it's not all that
bad as this inhumane film would
have us believe.
