Editorial Comment

The Year Starts Now

The budget is unfrozen. For Student Association, the year
begins now.

This is the year when Student Association must forge an entirely
new image and thrust or face stagnation and irrelevance. This is
themyear Studth Association must visibly become progressive,
must untie itself from the cycle of internal and relatively
insigniﬁcant affairs. This is the year when Student Association
must contront the problems and needs of students at Albany
State, and those problems and needs are much deeper and more
significant than those of organized clubs and activities.

The essential fact of this university is that the great body of
students are disorganized and have chosen to be so. Sailing and
athletics and even participation in the media and in organized
representation themselves, while desirable and necessary, do not
relate to the body of students. For the vast majority, such
activities do not relate to life ambitions and objectives, and thus
to making the four year stay at Albany Stat“ as productive and
meaningful as possible.

Yet, parliamentary procedures have it, and traditions and
temperaments and tinIe—allolrncrrls Irave it. that llres heeonre
priorities. Representatives easily find themselves in the elitist and
illusory position of dealing witlr lliesc groups and not with the
unorganized body of the constituency. Little surpirse therefore
that Student Association in former years has Irad an extremely
poor record of leadership and has attracted only sporadic interest
of the student bodies.

Significant movements,
frustrations and goals have circumvented it, calling on ('cntral
Council only for recogrriliorr and funding. The strike, the
moritoria, student power. Third World, all Irave received funds.

representing latent needs and

but little organized leadership or assistance. lilecled strrderrt
leaders play games if they do not lead. in short. they hecornc
followers.

It is the primary function of Student representatives to confront
the inadequacies of the educational system. of the bureaucratic
process, of racisrrr, of budgetary policies and priorities. It Is the
function of Student Association to investigate and to effectively
take a stand on these issues.

Student Association slowley grows irrelevant and bureaucratic.
The year starts now.

Southern Comfort

You miss a friend when she's gone. You miss the voice that
inspired you (that’s a corny word: inspired). You miss the voice
that comforted you, helped shape your ideal in some way. showed
you that you could feel whatever you warned. do whatever you
wanted, be whatever you wanted. and still have her as a friend.

So long, Janis. We never really understood you. We dug your
Southern Comfort and your gutsy blues but we all said "that Is
you, not me" and set up the barriers. And Janis, lhat'sjust what
you sung about, and we‘re still doing it. and so maybe,
somewhere, you're still singing the blues.

Day Care: The Basic Issues

by Alan Alpern

How is a woman to fulfill her
educational and vocational poten-
tial when she has children and is
forced to be a full-time home»
maker"! The demand for a student,
faculty and stuff Day Care Center
on this University campus was first
marit- in January, |5l70 and many
of those concerned feel that the
[)in> (fare concept as originally
viewed by the parent, the very
person who would be using this
‘ Ility, has been subjected to a
: .tr-mic destruction of content.

The Day Care supporters say
that from the time the Admin-
istration admitted to the need of a
Day Care Center, in May,iil7t)
under pressure of the Student.
Strike, issue after issue has been
fabricated (space, money, etc.) to
stall progress on the Center, and
more important to allow for the
substitution of the Administra-
tion's concept of a “model” Day
Care Center. Women's Liberation
argues that not one purpose of the
Center as seen by the parent has
been retained in the token center

   

 

which the Administration is offer-
ing.

The Administration's center en-
tails rr maximum of 45 children,
when the facility is legally capable
of serving 120 children, and a
survey last spring of only 600
questionnaires showed a need for
281) children. Use of the Center
has been limited to students only,
when the original demand was for
its use by students, faculty, anrl
staff. Adjusting itself to the . r
of 15, a competitive system for
determining use of the Center has
been established whereby use
would be determined by financial,
rather llran practicle or total need.

The Administration feels that its
low fee Center, a substitution for
the original free Day Care con-
cept, would still be a great “com-
munity” service. A Women's Lib-
eration spokeswoman said the Ad-
ministration has continually en-
joyed putting forth the facade of
Working with the women, when in
reality it has worked in opposition
to the program detailed in the
original demands of the concerned
women, parents and their support
ers.

 

 

.\

when the Administration
constantly argues that there is a
lack of funds for the Day Care

Center.

A Women’s Liberation spokes~
woman noted that all of this is
part of the Administration's refus—
al to recognize the basic issue of
this entire struggle, the oppression
of women in a male dominated
society. Many students may well
remember the ease and efficiency
with which the Strike Committee's
“tin-official" Day Care Center ran
during last spring's strike. it
Would be beneﬁcial to the entire
University Community if the Ad
ministration would finally engage
itself in a meaningful commitment
to the Day Care concept as set

The most recent issue has been
that of the residents of Pierce Hall
who objected to having the Center
in their dorm, which is remini-
scent of the problem of Narcotics
Centers several years ago, when
everyone felt we should have
them, but not in my neighbor-
hood. ’l‘o satisfy these students
the Administration gave them a
representative on the Day Care
Board of Directors (women and
parents combined have three out
of fourteen members) and addi~
tiomrl funds to make their “sub-
standard” dorm more liverrble,
when the Administration con»
stantly argues that there is a lack
of funds for the Day Care Center.

Corruption and Nepotism in FSA

by Bob Warner,

.‘lssociate News Editor
The Faculty-Student
tiorr (FSA) which
nearly every nonvrrcadcmic
function on campus, must be
either drastically overhauled or
abolished in favor of a better

Associa-
monopolizes

system.

The FSA problem is two-fold:
the visible corruption and its im-
mediate manifestations which
L'tIUSt' it to be unresponsive to
students; and the broader i 'uc of
whether students are be.. served
by a paternalistic, undemocratic
bureaucracy or by a genuine asso»
ciation controlled by Innl for the
benefit of the faculty and student
body alike, frrr lilt'pn-senl trrgarri‘
lotion is compole neither of
faculty nor students to tllly signifi-
cant degree.

The immediate pressing trues“
tions that should be asked of lt‘SA
pertain to the charges of nepo-
tism, the poor wages paid to
strident food workers, and the
disbursement of net profits at the
end of each your.

The charge of nepotism stems
from the fact that four members
of one family Work for [’SA, two
on an executive bands. (The name
will be wilhuld for obvrous reu-
sona). 'l‘his tlut'ri not directly hurt
students, but it indicates Ir breach
of ethics on the part Irf FSA, it
seems, than, that the organization
exists for the benefit of its top
workers, and not for those who
support it financially, i.c. the stu-
dents.

   
 

 

 

 

’I‘be wage issue, naturally, is a
bread-and-butter fight between
food service workers and FSA.
Food service workers are paid
$1.60 an hour, which is 25 cents
below the State minimum wage.
This is not. illegal, however, sincu
Iron-profit institutional organiza-
tions are exempt front the law.
But it is immoral that a university,
which commits itself to intellec-
tual integrity, pays its strident
workers insulting wages.

The disbursement of FSA pro‘
fits, which one your ( 67-63 ) went
to the improvement of the Mo»
hawk and Dippikill campuses, is
an outrage. 'l‘hat profits in the
range of $00,000 should not be
given either to food service or the
bookstore so that prices might be
lower is uncomprehensible. 'l'he
Mohawk campus does not directly
benefit ncrrrly oncvbrrlf the stu»
dent body, while deflated meal
contract prices or bookstore pri-
t'cs directly [retrofits all.

The aforementioned three grie-
vunces, however, need only re-
ftrrnr. But is that till that is needed
of it‘SA‘.’ Couldn't such an organi-
zation he strident and faculty
owned‘.’ This Is certainly an ex
citing prospect to explore,

The creation of u student-facul-
ty cooperativo would solve the.
question of paternalism vs. aeIfA
determinism. in other words, the
governance of It‘SA by those who
directly benefit from it would ha
a solution to the organization

which exists mm; it is presently
under control of only the Presi-
dent and the Vice- President for
Management arid Planning. StIch rr
hierarchy, which only tokenly
recognizes students, has simply
refused to relinquish its paternalis-
tic role. "FSA knows what is
best," so therefore students better
keep their minds on their work.
“FSA is in charge; it has ovary-
thing under control,"

'i'hcrr'frrrc, simple reform scents
Irot quite good enough, since Mr.
Cooley (Executive Director of
l’SA) will never give up his deci-
sion-making power- He will
always know what. is best, better
that thr- Iucky beneficiaries of his
bt-neficencc.

He has appointed an Assistant. to
the Director of Students Affairs
of FSA, which on the surf' to was
a good step. However, Peter Blnis,
a senior, the occupant of the
newly created position, no matter
how sincere he might he, serves at
the pleasure of Mr, Cooley lf
Blais pushes too hard or rubs
Cooley the wrong way, be Is out
of a job. Blair. cannot really be
l'ffl't‘lin' when he derthn his
strength from his target, and not
from an independent constitu-
uncy.

lt‘SA may or may Irrrt democra-
tize itself from within; but it is
entiruly possible that Student
Association will assume the po-
worn and responsibilities of the
organization from without.

Seek to Unionize

by Robert Schwartz

Disgusted with current Faculty-
Studeni Association employment
practices, about twenty workers
from the various food service
units met last Thursday night to
form some sort of organization
through which they can openly
negotiate with the FSA manage-
ment for better working condi-
tions.
’l‘hrrir grievances cr-ntercd
around three issues. The prime
grievance was it‘SA's refusal to pay
thr- minimum wage of SIX?) per
hour (almost all t’SA employees
only t'artt $1.00 an hour), The
organizers ol' the met-ting I-mpha-
sized that l"S/\. a nonprofit or-
ganization, is not obligated by law
to pay lbr' minimum wage despite
the fact that it made a 2% across
the board profit last , a Claim-
ing that FSA can easily afford
wage increases, the group unani»
moust moved that there be a
“minimum wage for l’SA work-

SI-r'rrndly, the group decided to
bargain for a “graduated pay
scale“ for FSA workers based
upon the length of time worked.
'I‘hirdly, the group wants all work
ers to receive a free meal for each
merrl that. they work without hav-

This meeting was originally
called for only snack bar workers
who are already loosely organized,

ut the snack bar employees at
the last minute decided to expand
the meeting to include the organi-
zation of all FSA workers. This
involves workers from the various
quad cafeterias, the campus enter
cafeteria, and the members of tire
bookstore staff who have already
begun negotiating with the book»

and indicated that their fellow
workers had expressed great in«

at the meeting decided to return
to their individual units and pub-
licize the goals of the group with
the hope of having a large general
meeting of all it‘SA workers later
this week to map more definite
plans for the future.

An unresolved debate occurred
over whether or not the workers
should call themselves a union.
’l‘bose favoring this idea argued
that there must be a permanent
organization to protect lt‘SA
workers. Others opposed the
union notion because of FSA‘s
ruling which prohibits unioniza-
tion. They felt that the union
label would only serve to harden
the FSA management against
worker grievances,

Despite continual it‘SA opposr
Lion to strident unionization over
the past few years, organizers of
the meeting cited several factors
which they feel will enable work-
on»; "to openly ask the manage-
ment of it‘SA ttr hour Wrrrkcrs'
grievances." ’I‘huy mentioned Ver-
bal backing which several student
leaders IravrI given in support of Ir
union. in addition, these leaders
would llkt‘ President Bent-zt-i to
review the entire l"SA structure.
Finally, several people in the free
school have been t'trrrpt't‘ttliltg with
this burgeoning effort to end the
unequal and second rate status
under which lt'SA workers are

 

now employed.
