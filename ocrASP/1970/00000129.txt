Israeli Calls for

Mid-East Harmony

by Liz Elsesser

Jews and Arabs can live together
in peace, according to Uri Avnery
who presented his solution to the
Middle Eastern problem on Sun-
day in a lecture sponsored by the
Peace institute.

Here only a short time from
Israel, Avnery, a member of the
Israeli Parliament, hits offered his
peace proposal in many places,
Washington included. He is the
editor of Israel‘s leading neWs
magazine and the author of Israel
Without Zionists “-

The problem as seen from the
Arab point of view (and iiiter-
prctcd by Avnery) is that Pale-
stine has been Arab for 1300
years. Suddenly the Jews came in,
drove contingents out and took
over. The Jewish counterpart is
that they were oppressed in
Europe and in need of a home-
land. Because they were originally
from Palestine, that was their
choice. The Arabs opposed this.

The dialogue that has been going
on until this point can best he
described as tWo people talking to
themselves. Racial debate is iin-
possible, as the opposite side is
ignored. There is no military solit-
tion either, according to Avnery.
The war was inevitable, What

started with sticks and pistols, has
now graduated to rifles and mis-
slcs. Avnery feels that nuclear
arms are not far away. As he sees
it, there are two national move-
ments iii the same country anti-
existing anti claiming llie land as
theirs. The irony involved is that

An ASP Opinion

neither side recognizes one an-
other, but will kill each other each
day.

His proposed peace plan is as
follows:

1) formation of a Palestinian-
Arab State in federation with the
Jewish State of Israel.

2) settling of the Palestinian
refugees under the supervision of
the federation.

1i) eventual integration of both
states in a regional confederation
of all states in the Middle East
bound by a just peace, political
and economic cooperation and
collective security provisions,

Otherwise the only alternatives
are having one people kill the
other, one people take over and
subjugate the other, both make a
plan for peace, or both Ich to-
gether in one state or two.

Peaceful co-existencc has no re-
ality today. EVCII if an agreement
was worked out. experience indi-
cates that the two would soon lie
at each others throats. The divi-
sion 1.1" power in Cyprus is a prime
example. Avnery finally stated
that the only solution, by process
of elimination, is to establish two
separate states, sovereign aan iii-
dependent. lie has advocated this
along with the UN. since 111-18.
One would be Jewish aan one
would he Arab, with Jerusalem in
between as a separate entity, and
economic relations existing.

A short question period fol-
lowr-d and although many Arabs
and chs Were present, order
existed throughout,

SUA Report

Presented

by Ken Stokem

The ad hoc committee set up by
Central Council to investigate and
report on WSUA operations called
for greater supervision and care in
handling WSUA funds and func-
tions in its 22 page report which
was presented at last Thursday’s
Council meeting.

The report, written by Tom
Clingan, chairman of the WSUA
Investigation Committee, looked
thoroughly into the past, present,
and future of WSUA. it discussed
the problems involved in moving
WSUA uptown, and going FM
stereo, with a rationale given for
each.

The move uptown should relieve
many of the communication and
personnel problems now facing
the station. And, if WSUA went
FM it could reach a larger audi-
encc and improve its pro-
gramming. The projection now for
a move to FM stereo is 1974,
when the studii s expected to be
built in the West Podium exten-
sion are completed.

The report also explained the
reasons behind many of the viola-
tions of Student Association fi-
nancial policy by the station over
the summer. it did not. absolve
i-vcryone completely of guilt, but
it (lid suggest that the results of
the violations were not all harm-
t'iil. Si-vvral violations may have
led to substantial savings in time
and money for WSUA, and may
have even linproved their broad-
casting signal, according to the
report.

Council accepted the recom-
mendations with amendments by
a 16-1-5 vote. It is the function of
the SA President now to imple-
ment the ri-conimenrlations ot the
report.
