which authorizes detention for suspicion of possible future wrong-
doing. This law is broad enough so that in 1968, the House Internal
Security Committee suggested that the Detention Camp Law be

invoked to eliminate trouble-makers in disturbances in the

Communities.

GE also urges passage of a bill
which protects defense facilities
such as GE and Honeywell to the
extent that any employee who
disagrees with government policy
or supports his union’s struggles
may be discharged.

Last spring College Press Service
reported that GE was reluctant to
advertise in student newspapers
whose editorial line had “gone off
the far end" in GE’s view. They
requested that the National Edu-
cational Advertising Service
(NEAS) make “an analysis of cur-
rent college newspapers including
the extent to which they have
become propaganda organs for
radical student organizations."
NEAS agreed to conduct such a
study until work of the survey
leaked to members of the U.S.
Student Press Association. At
USSPA's suggestion, NEAS aban-
doned the analysis.

The Capitol Area Peace Center
at 727 Madison Avenue is about
to conduct research into the na-
ture and breadth of General Elec-
tric's defense activities. The Peace
Center needs and Wants interested
students to aid in this valuable
research. Interested students may
contact the Peace Center on Madi-
son Avenue or look for signs of a
campus meeting about the GE
Project in the near future.

Want tickets to “Hair,” “Man of
La Mancha," a Knick game, or a
concert in the Boston Garden?
The Campus Center Information
Desk can get them for you.
Through their Ticketron Service,
it is now possible to order tickets
in advance for many events
throughout New York State and
the Boston area. A schedule for
available concerts, plays, and
other happenings is at the Desk
and is for use by all people at
Albany State.

As most students know, the
Desk supplier. general info. How»
ever, many are not aware that
they can sign out playing cards,
chess sets, and other games.

The Desk is open seven (lays a
week to serve Albany State stu—
dents. In the near future, it will
remain open until -l:()0 a.m. on
weekends. If this is successful and
worthwhile, it will remain open
until 4:00 on Thursdays and Sun-
days also. Some day, it is hoped
that the Desk will have a compu-
ter device which can answer
phones after closing and give out
events for the coming day.

In the meantime, the purpose of
the Inforrriation Desk is to serve
the people of Albany State.
Therefore, it is necessary for the
people to supply information also.
If there are lectures, meetings, etc.
it is requested that you inform the
Desk. In that way, they can make
the news available. Thomas Wil-
helm, director of the Desk, has
stated that he will welcome any
ideas on how to improve thr.l
service from students.

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1970

Professor Grenander of the En-
glish Department has taken issue
with Professor Brown ‘s contro-
versial report on Campus security.
Specifically, she objects to the
section of Brown '5 report support-
ing [lie concept of “selective en-
forcement" of campus laws. Her
detailed critique follows...

The ASP, as usual, has served
admirably as our most effective
medium of campus communica-
tion in its detailed presentation of
the Brown Report on campus
security. Nevertheless, I think the
implications of this report deserve
far more scrutiny than they seem
to be receiving.

In particular, the concept of
"selective enforcement of laws"
requires very careful critical analy-
sis. If this means what it says, it
can be interpreted in only two
ways: (1) some laws will be en-
forced, some laws will be ignored;
or (2) some offenders will be
prosecuted, some offenders will
not be prosecuted, It is to these
two issues that I wish to address
myself.

Surely if, as Professor Brown is

quoted as having written, aca-
demics” maintain that certain
laws are “stupid, even immoral” (I
agree, incidentally; some of them
are), then the proper role of aca-
demics is to educate students in
the principles by which those laws
can be condemned as “stupid,
even immoral;" and to educate
them in the processes by which
laws can be changed. Educators
are the first to complain—rightly
so—about legislative infringements
on academic prerogatives. But the
knife cuts both ways; by the same
token, legislators hiiVe the right to
complain about academic infringe-
ments of legislative prerogatives.
For a university to insist that the
laws apply to everyone else—but
only “selectiVely” to its own
members .' a peculiar interpreta-
tion of academic freedom, to say
the least.

Only a few years ago, northern
academics Were among ll’it' first to
point a self-righteous finger at the
University of Alabama and [he
University of Mississippi, when
they tried not to admit black
students. “The law of the land,"
they were told, applied. Alabama

and Mississippi, you will recall,
used the same argument that Pro-
fessor Brown is using now. “The
law of the land," they said, did
not apply to southern universities,
since it was not supported by
“community opinion." “The con-
science of the [southern] com-
munity" regarded IaWS in support
of racial equality as “stupid and
immoral." Therefore—in the
southern university—such laws,

they claimed, ought not to be
enforced.

I found this argument pernicious
when it was used by the Univer-

sity of Mis. 's‘ ; I find it per-
nicious when it used by the State
University of New York at Al-
bany.

If the implications of this posi—
tion are disturbing, howchr, the
implications of the second posi-
tion are sinister. Suppose "select-
ivc enforcement of laws" means
that some offenders will be pro-
secuted; some offenders will not
be prosecuted. What happens to

safeguards), the door is clearly
opened to amnesty for anyone
who agrees with “us,” prosecution
of anyone who disagrees with
“of—whoever “us” may be at the
moman In other words, the sc-
curily force becomes merely an
agent of “community opinion“
for punishing nonconformists and
for alisolving conformists from
individual responsibility for their
actions. Indeed, individual respon-
sibility bccomcs meaningless,
since one can always hide under
the blanket of “community opin-
ion," Initially, at least, I suspect
llial this principle would operate
in some such fashion as follows: a
glictto yonlh who smashed a com-
puter during a strident strike
would not be prosecuted. IIow-
r-vcr, lbc particular example
chosen is not importanl; what is
important are the dangers to indi-
vidual liberties aan civil rights
implicit in the principle of “select-
ch enforcement" itself.

When we are told that guidelines
will be “social engineering“ rather
than constitutional legal safe-
guards, the principle becomes a
really terrifying one. “Social en-
gineering“ is a perniciously ab-
stract Icrlii which masks llie fact
that social ciigiiiccrs—i.c., human
beings, With their prejudices are
required In do the engineering. In
olhcr words, the social engineers,
presumably, will attempt to
manipulate non-coiiformists until
they reflect the "conscience of
the community" (another per-
nicionsly abstract term). This an
gumcnl stood the Spanish Iii-
quisilion and its agents in good
sir-ad; surely, however, it is un-
worlby of a university. A few
years ago we saw the “conscience
of the community" operating in
certain southern universities. It

happened not to be the con-
science of most northern univer-
sity communities; it was not un-
dermined, however, by the con-
science of SUNYA, but by the
Supreme Court, operating within
a legal framework.

What I am suggesting is that to
substitute “social engineering" for
legal rights and legal sanctions,
equally applicable to all, is to
create a dangerous instrument for
forging the fetters of conformity
to local prejudice. Once the prin-
ciple of the university in loco
part-nits was abandoned—and, on
the whole, I am glad it has been
abandoned—we can no longer
have much faith in the spectacle
of a stern dean, lecturing an errant
group of crestfallen students who
hang their heads in guilt and strive
to mend llieir ways. The picture is
already quaint. The typical dean
today is an intimidated man, with
the vision always before him, in
cas s involving errant students, of
a screaming mob howling for am-
nesty and shouting epithets, "fas-
cist pig" being among the milder
ones. Sometimes the vision be—
comes a reality, and he may sue-
cumb to the heart attack which
seems to be one of his occupation-
al hazards.

These are hardly circumstances
in which the university may func-
tion in loco purcnli's. I agree with
Professor BrOWn that it no longer
should. Like Professor Brown, I
presume, I prefer to regard univer-
sity students as adult citizens. But
the assumption of adulthood carv
ries with it adult responsibilities;
equality before the law is one of
them. To attack elitism in the
realm of intellectual excellence is
to embrace mediocrity; to sponsor
elitism m the realm of legal cul-
pribility is to embrace naked total-
itririanism.
