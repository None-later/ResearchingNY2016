GriddersWin 1st Ever 3 0-21 Over RIT

by Mike Piechowicz

The Great Danes of Albany
State registered a stunning 30-21
upset victory over R.I.T. Satur-
day, in the school's first football
game in its 126 year history.

Thirty-eight hundred people
watched running back Bernie
Boggs rush for 148 yards, score
three touchdowns, and kick two
field goals to power the Albany
offense.

R.I.T. won the toss and little
else, as Butch McGuerty covered a
Tigerfumble on the first play from
scrimmage. With Albany in con-
trol on the R.I.T. 35 yd. line, the
call went twice to freshman full-
back Rudy Vido. Vido picked up
nine on the first try, and went to
the 16 on the second when the
ball popped free and was quickly
smothered byanR.l.T. jersey.

The State defense established
the reputation they were to en-
force throughout the game as they
held fast on a third down and
three play.

Albany took the punt on the
R.I.'l‘. 418 yd. line and sent Vido
into the lint for two. Quarterback
Bill Flanagan ran the ball to the
24 on an option, and called a
hand-off to Boggs, who scampercd
into the end zone, only to have a
penalty bring the ball back to the
twenty-nine. Boggs put it back on
the twenty-four on the next play,
and two downs later, Flanagan liit
Ed Williams two yards short of
the first down. Faced with a

fourth and two at the seventeen,
the Danes decided to go for it.
Workhorse Rudy Vido dch threw
the middle for the first down, and
added two more to the nine on
the next play. Briggs then bolted
around left end for the score. The
kick was wide, and State led 6-0

The Great Danes added a field'
goal early in the second quarter
when Boggs connected on a 25
yarder that capped a drive that
started on the R.I.T. 36 with a
short Tiger punt.

R.I.T. running stars Pat Musca-
rella and Joe Widay were unable,
once again, to move the ball on
the next series of downs and
Rochester was forced to punt.
Albany started from their 22, and
sent Williams wide to the right. He
raced down field and veered over
the middle, and as he did so the
ball was there to meet him. He
outran the last man to score on a
seventy-eight yard touchdown
pass, that moved the count to
15-0.

As the half drew to a close, the
monopoly on the game that State
had established began to weaken.
The Great Danes came into pos-
session of the ball on their three
yard line as the result of an R.|.T.
drive that fizzled. The first
play led to an illegal call that
moved Stale back to its one.
Flanagan then took the snap,
jumped as if to hit tight and Ed
Pcrka with a quick pass, and came
down with the ball when he saw
Ihat Pcrka had been unable to
break free. Flanagan tried to
scramble to his right to save the
play, but he was dropped in the
end zone for a safety.

R.l.'l'. look the kick-off and out
of respect for the Danes defensive
line, went to the air. Their initial
driVe was shattered by a Royce
Van Evcra interception, but A1-
bany gave the ball back on a punt
four plays later, and Rl'l'. went
all the way with Tiger QB Rich
Knaack throwing a 15 yard touch-
down pass. The half drew to a
closc with Albany on top lFi-El.

The secdnd'lialf was Briggs ver-
sus R.I.T. as t a Dane co-captain
added two ,to ‘

‘ fhdownsi, a field
goal, and 94 y ds rushing to his
totals.

The field goal came first, as he
dropped it behind the goal post
with little to spare from 27 yards
out early in the third quarter.

On the R.I.T. series following
the three pointer, John Johnson
fell on a fumble to put. State on
the offense from the Tiger 39.
Three plays later, Boggs ground to
a halt in the end zone with a 39
yard touchdown run that moved
the score to 211-9.

Several series later, R.l.T. show-
ing the strain, dropped the ball
twice. The first time they picked
it up themselves, but the second
time Albany's Jack Otto was
there.

On offense again, and clearly in
control of the game, Albany be-
gan to roll. Flanagan hit swing-
back Larry Peterson with a 34
yard toss to the 29 of R.I.T.
Faced with a third and five, Boggs
again got the call and again ran
out of field, as hc rambled 24
yards for the score. The extra
point try was blocked and Albany
led .‘lll-l).

R.l.T., perhaps sensing the ur-
gency of their statc, began to
mch when it took possession of
lllc ball. They drove to the Albaii-
y 112 where Stale once again tur-
ncd in a defensive gem. Senior
defensive tackle Milcli Drucker
jumped on a loose hall to cnd the
threat.

Albany watched the clock tick
off valuable minutes before it was
forch lo punt the ball back.

Boaters Lose to
New Paltz, 8-2

by Robert Mireit

On Saturday, Albany's Varsity
soccer team lost to a powerful
New Paltz squad by a score of 8-2.
The end of the first half found the
two teams in a 1-1 deadlock but
New Paltz exploded for seven
goals in the second halti, display-
ing some fine offensive play.

New Paltz opened the scoring
whcn Pobbi Asare, a native of
Africa, dented the nets. The
Danes, though, came back to lie
the score when Demetrius
Michael's penalty kick found its
mark in the second quarter.

The second half in contrast to
tlic first stanza, was dominated by
tho visitors. After tWo quick
scores, the Albany defense sccmcd
lo crumble and proceeded to al-
low tlircc more goals in the third
quarter and t.Wo more in thc final
period. Michael's second success-
ful penalty kick accountcd for the
only Albany score in the second
half. Now Palm‘s superb halaiice
was apparent. as seven different
players scorcd, including Hub

Stonitsch Leads
Post Over
Danes, CCNY

by Dave Fink

Saturday saw the return to Al-
bany of Ron Stonitsch, one of the
top six or seven cross country
runners in the nation, for the first
time since last year’s Albany Invi-
tational when he set a course
record of 241 minutes and 57
seconds over the 5 mile lay-out.

Stonitsch paced his CW. Post
team to a triangular meet victory
by an 18-42-82 score over State
and CCNY respectively. This loss
to Post marked the Dane Harriers’
first home loss since the initial
meet of the 1968 season.

Dennis Hackett was the first
Albany runner to finish, taking
third plaCe behind both Stonitsch
and his Post teammate John
Haberkern in a time of 27:16, just
two seconds behind the latter.
The victors also took the :lth, 5th,
and sixth positions with Nick
DeMarco and Pat chfert nailing
down the seventh and eighth spots
for/Slate.

Stonitsch's winning time of
26:40 was well below his course
record but to say that he won
easily Would be putting it lightly.
He found time during the race to
drop back and tell his teammates
to keep moving and generally
seemed to just enjoy the race. '

This loss is the first of the year
for the Danes and you can bet
you won't. sci: too many of them
this year.

Camino Real Opens Tomorrow;

by Gregory Haynes

The State University Theatre in
cooperation with Theatre Council
will present Tennessee Williams'
Camino Real as its first major
production of the season. It runs
October 14-17 at 8:30, and on
Sunday, October 18, a matinee at
2:30. The production will be pre-
sented on the Main Stage of the
Performing Arts Center.

Tennessee Williams describes his
play as “the construction of
another world, a separate exist-
ence." It is a journey into the
Twilight Zone of Loneliness. Kil-
roy. the everyman in all of us,
stumbles into Camino Real only
to find such characters as Don
Quixote, Lord Byron, Jacques
Casanova, Marguerite Gautier, and
the Gypsy. Even the structure of
the play is a separate experience.
It has no scenes or acts, but
instead is divided into sixteen
blocks, as though you arc traVcl-
ing down the road.
