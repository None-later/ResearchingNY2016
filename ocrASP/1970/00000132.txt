Justice Department

On the surface. the decision by Attorney (icttcral John Mitchell
to send representatives to the campuses appears as an attempt to
create dialogtic and to clear away the hostilities and misconcep-
tions between the Administration and the campuses. Underneath.
however, this move seems a dramatic developroerrt in the
never-ending game of using students as political tools.

Clearly, there is reason to question the sincerity ot the roove. It
follows directly in the wake of the passage of a l),(‘. (‘rrioc Bill.
the Administration‘s bltrepririt Ior cornbatitig crime in the nation
but also its blue print for curtailing constitutional rights. It cotncs
closely on the heels of a request by the Federal Bureau of
Investigatroii for added funds lor llltlt) new undercover agents to
investigate campuses subject to no control or authority other than
J. Edgar Hoover a direct contradiction of the traditiotr of
cooperation with loerrl police agencies as well as college adminis-
trators. Finally, it comes frorn an administration that has shown
little responsiveness to students, labelling actrvrsts as "Intros" and
vilifying even the blaridest recoromeridatiorr of the Scranton
Commission that it exercise “moral leadership.”

It is hard to escape the coriclirsiorr that the Administration is
citltcr ignorant or repressive that it knows little of the needs .rrrd
visions of students or that, knownig them. it has taken a stance ol
eontnrued resistance to change. If the Justice Departriient has
reason to fear violence and terrorism on the campuses. it has no
r-ason to identify sticli actions as the rriain thrust ol change and
activism. To adopt such a stance ttscll' sows the seeds of terrorism
witlrln the national debate and in America. l‘l7tl. requires little
political courage.

by Al Seniu
This Wt't'k marks the beginning

maim, and brutalize. Contrary to
liberal beliefs, blowing up induc-
tion centers will stop the system
more effectively titan sitting on
the steps will.

It has been argued that this
property violence also leads to
pt-rsomtl injury. The bombing of
an army math research center
(AMRC) at the University of Wis-
consin last August 2-l, in which ‘
man was killed. is cited as an
example.

While true that one person was
killed, it should also be realized
that the death was accidental and
unplanned. The bomb was set off
at 3:00 a.m., hardly a peak time
period. And it exploded prema-
turely.

It should also be rcalizod that
the research center had provr-n

representatives visited army in-
stallations across the country and
provided advice on weaponry
problems. In short, AMRC's r-
esearch has been responsible for
the deaths of thousands of pin"
stills.

But the facts were overlooked!
tlltt' man inside at JlItltl a,m. was
accidentally killed. 'I‘licrcforc. the
movement was guilty of murder.

Vol. IV” No. 27

by Elizabeth Sciariiii

Are today’s women oppressed
by the institutions of marriage
rind the family? According to Miss
Evelyn Reed, :1 national spokes-
woman for the Woman's Libera-
tion Moverment and socialist acti-
vist who spoke here on Tuesday,
this is one of the major problems
With the structure of today's soci-
ety.

Making several references to her
booklet, Problems of ll’mncn's
Liberation; A Marxist Approach,
Miss Reed proposed three ques-
tions concerning marriage rind the
family as a man-made social insti-
tution. Her first question, “What
kind of society requires marriage
rind the family and for what pur-
pose," began her discussion on
what resembled a lecture on the
history of the enslavoment of wo-
men throughout western civilizas
tion.

Miss Reed made reference to
Engels' book, Origin of the Fami-
ly. Private Property and lllt’ State,
showing how marriage begun as an
institute to serve the men of
Wi'ttltll in the patriarchal society.
She then pointed out that during
the Feudal period, the “right to
marry" was extended to the mid-
dle class with the rise of Chris»
tinnity, Later, with the rise of
Capitalism, came the privilege of
universal marriage, the “bonds of
women." At present, it now ctr
vers all Classes. Women are no
longer workers in the family, as
seen in an agricultural society;
they have become consumers
dependent upon their husbands.

Miss Reed's second question
was, “How are women degraded
try this institution and human
needs thwarted?" She pointed out
that the social, sexual and intel-
lectual needs of women are stin-
ted by our society as is the right
to unrestricl rl development. of
LIIt‘ brain and cultural life. She
made an analogy to this by coin-
paring the female sex to a colonial
country under a mother imperi-
alist nation. It was not until the

that it is what the speaker termed,

women are struggling for eco-
nomic recognition and are being
doubly oppressed: on the job and
at home. The growing influx of
women as workers is bringing the
growth of women searching for
liberation, possibly through eco-
nomic independence

Miss Reed‘s third question asked
about the prospects of the family
institution and what. must be done
for women to regain Lt rtrol of
their destiny. One answer given
was that society must be restruc-
tured along with the restructuring
of the family set-up, Already
there are many changes rind wo—
men nre launching many offenses.
The abortion law and the current
sexual revolution are examples of
this. The “double standard" is
being scurried by many women.
The WLM wants new social no-
sexual norms and wants them
extended to the realms of family
morality.

Miss Reed noted that love must
also be redefined so that people
will no longer be merely “eli1bor~
ate, expensive furniture” in each
others' lives. In particular, she
ridiculed the middle class homes
where love is often measured in
terms of how much parents buy
for their children.

Concluding, Miss Reed stated
that the WLM begun about l-l/L’
years ago with strong anti-Capital-
istie feelings. She looked beyond
the institutions of marriage and
the family and then questioned
the right of the Cripitnlistic system
to its own existence. In reference
to man's observation in Look,
Miss Reed concluded that the
women‘s revolution will lend to '
human revolution when human
will not settle for less than their
potential, when they will no loo»

Non-violent Action

by Walt Keller

“I don‘t. think there's any differ-
ence between a cop shooting it kid
or a kid shooting a cop-they both
mean death." This statement. was
made by Roy Dickson, in ii meet-
ing of the Institute of Non-Vio-
lence on October 14. The organi-
zation begun by Joan Baez in Pain
Alto, California, has been ex-
panded into other cities ricross the
nation.

Dickson, a former student here
at SUNYA, had resisted the draft,
and their goml to Boulder, Colo-
rado where he became actively
involved in the non-violent l‘l'Vt)lII-

group to become a non-violent
force in the community. This is
attempted mainly through form-
ing food coups, li'iiflclling and
demonstrations

Denise Breetburg, a student
here, then spoke about war tuxos.
Speaking for the group. she advo-
