Burnett Discusses
Social Restraints

by Kathy Stabbert

Opportunities for rebuilding
democratic socialism are brighter
than they have been since the
days of Eugene Debs, according to
Jim Burnett. Burnett, currently a
professor of Political Science at
York College, spoke to a group of
approximately fifty people in II
speech sponsored by the Young
People‘s Socialist League on Octo-
ber 14.

Burnett's speech related the tra-
ditional socialist ideas concerning
the working class, changes and
developments in socialist. thought
since Marx and the labor move-
ment and modern American poli-
tics in relation to socialism.

Burnett's address explained
Marx's mistaken prediction con-
cerning the increasing oppression
of the workini,r class. Since Marx
was provr-n wrong, some socialists
felt that there would be no social»
ist revolution, just. a series of
reforms within the Labor Move-
ment. Burnett referred to this
point of view as “Pullyiinnish.”
He said that a socialist movement
must relate to the workers, repre-
senting their needs, He cites the
American socizilists' failure to do
this as the cause of their weak-

Burnett then traced the history
of the American Socialist move-
ment, examining its decline during
the twenties, thirties, and during
and after World War 11.

Noting recent favorable develop-
ments, he feels that “things are
going in Ii much more optimistic
direction (for the Socialist Party)
titan many thought fifteen years
ago." Burnett stud that. there is
now ii need for the Socialist Party
in America to develop a close
relationship with the labor move-
ment. He added that. “this deve-
lopment is not. impossible, but
likely."

Burnett was introduced as an-

acknowledged expert on the labor
movement, to which he jokingly
replied that he would probably be
the only one who would acknow-
ledge it. Burnett, however, is 11
member of the National Commit-
tee ol' the Socialist Party, a former
student radical zit Berkeley and II
member of the Socialist. Party of
America.

Following his speech, a question
and answer period was held.

West End Podium Extension
To House New Facilities

by Sharon Cohen

As part. of the continuing expan-
sion of this State University cen-
ter, a West Podium extension is
now being planned.

Buffalo Birdshot

by Bill Vaccare

College Press Service

BUFFALO, N.Y.-(CI’S)AOn
the night of May 7, Buffalo police
occupied the State University of
New York at. Buffalo campus and
fired birdsliot at students protest-
ing the US. invasion of Com-
bodiu.

This was the conclusion of a
report issued in conjunction with
a group of law studean end the
Buffalo chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union, The report
indicates the following:

*tliiit Buffalo police fired bird-
shot that night at students with-
out pl‘t)Vt)Cilll()ll and wounded ill.
least twelve of them, and;

*thal both local, state, and Fed-
eral officials "expended little ef-
l'ort" to conduct a full and thor-
ough investigation of the incidents
and charged that there was. in
fact, “a predetermined effort" on
the part of some of these officials
to “whitewash” the incident.

Richard Rusclie, spokesman for
lllt' Concerned Law Students for
Peace, said flint efforts to get

local, state, and Federal officials
to conduct a full-fledged inquiry
“by the appropriate agencies
which have the capacity to do the
right kind of investigation have so
far met with little response.

“With all our efforts," he con-
tinued, “not. one real investigation
was initiated. The city of Buffalo,
the Erie County district. attorney,
the State of New York and the
Department. of Justice expended
little effort to adequately resolve
this issue."

Roscht- and his group based
their conclusions on 78 eye-
witness llL‘CtiunLﬁ‘“lllCllldlng a
number of personal interviews
with witnesses—medical reports
on students treated for pellet
Wounds, perforated windows in
North Union, as well as a nu-
merous assortment of metal pel-
lets, spent. shotgun shells, and
photographs taken (luring the iii-
cidenL

According to the report, the
responses by various officials
showed an extraordinary lack of
concern and complacency towards
the incident.

 

 

 

Homecoming Concerh

[county

Sergio Mendes and

Brazil ’66

with

Scales and Crofts

tickets on solo in CC Main Lobby 10 - 2 Mom-Fri

$2.50 w/tnx $5.0) w/out tax

 

 

Designed by Edward Duretl
Stone , the extension will have the
same type of white concrete struc-
ture as the present ticudemic po-
dium. Rather than a series of
buildings, though, it will be one
huge complex, about half the size
of the podium.

The disciplines sharing the com-
plex will be Humanities, Social
Science, Criminal Justice, Educa-
tion, Library Science, Social Wel-
fare, School of Business, and
School of Nursing. There will also
be additional student- faculty faci—
lities, including it cafeteria and
library facilities.

The building of the podium ex-

tension is contingent upon the
approval by the state legislature of
a $27 million budget request. If
the request is approved, it will
take effect on April 1, 1971, and
construction will begin in the late
spring or early summer.

It is expected that the extension
will be ready for partial occupan-
cy in two years (school year
1973-74), and is scheduled for
completion in three years (school
year 1974-75). As of yet, though,
the builder has not, been decided
upon. 7

A slightly larger east podium
extension is planned for the near
future also.

Correction

In the article, "Which Lirws to
be Enforced?" which appeared in
the Focus on October 13, u line
was omitted.

The passage should read: "lni-
tiiilly, at least, I suspect that this
principle would operate iii such
fashion as follows: a ghetto youth
who stole it car would be prose-
cuted; ii middle class youth who
smashed II computer during it stu-
dent strike would not be prose-
cuted.”

The Albany Student Press re-
grets the error and apologizes to
the author, M.E. Greniiiider.
