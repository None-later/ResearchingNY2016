The F.B.I., the Justice Depart-
ment, the Attorney General, the
Supreme Court, these are all insti-
tutions in which Americans place
great faith. If you’re one of
them-think again. Crime and dis-
sent are the two major issues in
the minds of Americans, and the
politicians know it. Almost all
candidates for office, from 1968
up until and including those run-
ning this coming November, use
fear tactics and crime statistics to
gain votes. They all use Iaw-n-or-
der rhetoric— Democrats, Repub-
licans, Reactionaries, "Liberals."
(See NY Times page 1, Oct. 12,
1970).

The public is being fooled, and
it may be too late when we finally
awaken to reality —: that the issue
of crime is being used to create a
terror in which a crackdown on all
"disruptive" elements will be
acceptable to the public.

The Dept. of Justice is headed
by a presidential appointee— the
Atty. General, who has the power
to control federal crime presecu-
tion, investigation of violations of
federal laws, federal prisons, citi-
zenship proceedings, foreign sub-
version and internal dissension,
riot conditions, drug trafficing,
drug rehabilitation, coordination
of state and local police, "corr-
ectional" institutions and courts,
screening of federal judge nomi-
nees, legal advising to the cabinet
and President, and drafting of
legislation to create a safer and
more equitable notion and the
application of the law in a more
just manner.

One man is delegated all this
power, to use or mis-use. When
Nixon became president in 1968,
one of his first acts was to replace
Atty. Gen'l Ramsey Clark with
John Mitchell. At the Republican
National Convention in Miami.
Nixon told what he believed was a
secret session of Southern dele-
gates (until thc Miami Herald prin»
ted a verbatim transcript made
from a tape recording of the
meeting) that he was going to run
the Dept. of Justice himself. “I
am going to take charge of this,
because I am a lawyer!"

"Nixon’s campaign manager
Mitchell, once the A.G., surroun’
ded himself with his "own kind of
people." His second in command
is Richard G. Kleindienst, who
was national director of field

"Kleindienst was said to be
somewhat to the right of Gold-
water." “At the start of a two
hour visit he paid (then Att’y
Gen‘l') Ramsey Clark for a brief-
ing on the Dept. of Justice, he
suggested that he be dealt with on
the assumption that he didn't
know anything. “I found nothing
to challenge the assumption,"
Clark remarked afterward. Klein-
dienst had reportedly promised to
crack down on “draft-dodgers,"
on “anarchistic kids," and on
“militants” of all persuations...
student radicals were regarded as
an even greater threat than the
forces of organized crime..." Per-
haps they know too much.

Jervis Leonard was made Ass't
Att’y Gen’l, in charge of the Civil
Rights Division. When appointed,
he was a member of an all-white
fraternal organization called the
Order of the Eagles. Ultra-conser-
vative Texas Seantor John Tower
was given a pick of Ass't Att’y
Generals. His choice was Texan
Will Wilson, as head of the Crimi-
nal Division. Wilson, after taking
office said, "Clark's trouble was
that he was philosophically con-
cerned with the rights of the
individual." “He was like a foot-
ball coach warning his players not
to violate the rules, when he
should have been telling them to
go in there and win."

When the changeover was ended
at the Dept. of Justice, Clark had
watched Mitchell “fire liberal law-
yers from the Civil Rights Divi-
sion, support Carswell and
Haynesworth (for Supreme Court
seats), and now Ramsey Clark
fears that his successors are begin-
ning to turn up the long-dormant
machinery of McCarthyism." He
has watches, appalled, as the Jus-
tice Dept. subpconaed media files
and notebooks, push preventive
detention, no-knock
and secret files.

First Speech on Crime

Nixon’s first major speech on
crime, Sept. 29, 1968: “Some
have said that we are a sick
society. We’re sick all right, but
not in the way they mean. We are
sick of what has been allowed to
go on in this nation for too long.
Under the stewardship of the pre-
sent Administration, (Johnson)
crime and violence...have in-
creased ten times faster than pop-
ulation."

He then reviewed a bunch of
statistics on rising crimes, and
ended with the fact that crime
had risen a total of 88%. He did
not mention that under Eisenho-
wer and himself, the rise was 98%.
Nixon continued, " Today it is
comparatively safe to break the
law. Something has gone terribly
wrong in America."

Local Police Forces

Of course, the main thing that
had gone wrong was that many
local police forces were too inept,
untrained, undermanned, or cur-
rupt to do their job. The current
preoccupation of most law-
enforcement agencies is how best
to use statistics for political mile<
age, because the more crimes re-
ported, the louder the public out-
cry and thus the allotment of
money and headlines for the po-
lice agencies. What do the statis-
tics really mean? Of the four
million serious crimes reported in
1968, only 12%, less than
500,000 were the kinds of crimes
the average citizen fears —- that is
violent or potentially violent
crimes.

In other words, 1/4 of 1% of the
population of the United States
would expect to be victims of
such crimes in a given year. Of
course, the profit-motivated mass
media will fabricate headlines
when necessary. By far the great-
est number of crimes were com-
mitted by slum-dwellers
other slum-dwellers, the victims
being mostly poor and non-white.
We must also remember that what
they mean by "crime" includes
things like smoking dope, loitering
(without money), homosexuality
and conspiracy to intend to may-
be commit a crime. Real criminal
activity, like mass murder, racism,
genocide and exploitation are con-
doned, if not caused by, the ruling
elite and its media.

Mitchell's first moves for law—
n-ordcr included replacing Robert

Morganthau, M.S. Attorney for
the Southern District of New
York State, one of the ﬁnest law
enforcers in the country, with
Whitney North Seymour Jr., son
of a Republican Party bigshot.
And on Sept. 4, 1969, in the NY
Post, James Wechsler charged
Mitchell and Hoover with at-
tempts to obstruct prosecution of
well-known white collar crook
Roy Cohn. Instead of enforcing
laws, the J.S. went about
restricting the rights of suspects.
Mitchell and Nixon pressured
Congress into passing a McClellan
Crime Bill that reversed the ac-
claimed Miranda decision (giving
suspects the rights of counsel,
etc.). Local authorities were al-
most unanimous in their protest
against the blatantly unconstitu-
tional law.

Law Enforcement Agency

The Law Enforcement Assist-
ance Agency, (LEAA) is supposed
to coordinate police training, riot
control and reduction of or-
ganized crime throughout the na-
tion by helping local police forces.
Unfortunately Congress has limit—
ed their giving funds to local
areas, under the “blockgrant
amendment,“ which allows states
to use the money for any purpose
they wanted, without LEAA ap-
proval needed.

The result has been that the
large cities get very little, due to
the apportionment of power in
the states, and police departments
have been using the money to
stockpile extravagant weapons
systems. In addition, the NY
Times of August 27, 1970; “the
Nixon Administration this month
is killing a widely acclaimed
(LEAA) program for frcruiting
college graduates as policemen.“
Smart cops seem to have con-
sciences.

House has any real understanding
of what’s going on among Black
men in our society. He's (Mitch-
ell) so out of touch that he
doesn’t call us Blacks, or Ne-
groes,—he calls us colored peo-
ple." The Justice Dept’s laxity in
enforcing anti-segregation laws
caused a Black advisor to the
United States Commission on Civ-
il Rights to resign, accusing the
President of having “broken faith
with millions of people."

Let’s TALK These Things Over

When a group of Black civil
rights workers travelled to Wash-
ington, DC, to protest the weak-
ening of the guidelines and re-
vision of the Voting Rights Act,
Mitchell ordered Assistant Att’y
Gen’l Leonard to see them.
Leonard appeared in the reception
room and when he saw that a
white woman was in the all-Black
crowd, he went “directly up to
her and said, ‘Let’s talk this thing
over.’

She shook her head. ‘l'm not
one of them, I‘m just a friend.
Talk to them.’ "

Leonard, in a fit of anger told
them that they were “extremely
presumptious," and that Mitchell
would see them later. adding that
if they didn’t leave immediately
they'd be dragged out. At another
time, over forty lawyers from the
Civil Rights Division organized a
“revolt” to protest Justice Dept.
policy, and they were asked to
resign. They refused.

Aliom Haynes:

The Good: The Bad and the Ugly

by Jeff Burger

It always amazes me to see the
number of records released each
week. Hundreds upon hundreds of
totally obscure unknowns flood
the market with varying degrees
of talent. Most of them never
make it, and with good reason.
The record companies hope that a
few of the many will make it big,
and make them rich.

I have here two samples of that
flood of music, both from Ampex
Records. The first is Aliolla
Haynes Music. For this record, I
have mild praise, with reservation.
If you are into lots of money, and
you buy lots of records, get it.
But if you restrict yourself to
those records you just can't live
without, forget it.

Aliotta Haynes isn‘t bad. It's a
simple album and not at all a
unique sound, nothing you run
out and tell your friends about.
The guitar work is simple, nothing
spectacular. The lyrics are simple,
too, but though you may feel as if
you've heard them before, I
wouldn‘t call them trite. It de-
pends on what head you're into,
but I look on them as being a nice
change from all the coded heavy
stuff we're used to (often by
people who don‘t know what
they're doing but who can’t get
out of Dylan's shadow). Aliotta
Haynes wrote all the words and
music except for James Taylor’s
"Fire and Rizlll"“ilnd they do a
rcally good job with that.

The album isn't too well pro-
duced. And it‘s certainly nothing
special, just a Very aVcrage folk
group. Still, it‘s a happy album
and easy to listen to, and, in spite
of anything I've written hcr‘c, I
find myself playing it u lot, and

enjoying what I hear.

The other album from Ampex is
called Special Songs and is by a
chick named Cheryl Dilchcr. Very
simply, it‘s horrible. If someone
offers you a free copy, pay him
not to give it to you. It's that bad.

She wrote the lyrics, and I think
she should‘ve used a pseudonym,
or at least she should've apolo-

ries a message. It is Mr. I-Iaack's'
ambition to continue with a ca-
reer in motion pictures, making
documentary and educational
films.

Putting The Babies Back, Part I],
selected by Brian De Palm, is an
enigmatic short film which Neal
M. White, the filmmaker, de-
scribes only as the sequel to the
yet to be released Pulling The
Babies Bach, Part I. Mr. White is a
graduate of the UCLA Film De-
partment and is currently an in«
structor in art at San Francisco

Example: I believe there will be a
better day/There will always be a
tomorrow/So will you be my
friend/And together we'll find/A
Better Day. Example: To love
your fellow man/For peace among
the land...Fricndship in the eyes
That could only despise/And most
important/There will be Iove...To
help the starving man/To lend a
helping hand...Money for the

more/And most important/There

Come on, Cheryl. I could go on,
but I won't. Suffice it to say that
by comparison Rod McKuen
writes as well as Dylan. And as for
her singing, by comparison Jerry
Lewis is Gordon Lightfoot. What‘s
worse, you can tell by the way she
sings that she thinks she‘s per»
forming a masterpiece.

Art is subjective and maybe
somebody out there will dig this.
But, in my opinion, it would be
better for you to avoid being
susbjected to this worthless piece
of vinyl. If you should ever see a
copy of this record, he sure to
place it in a trash can. Littering
can get you a $50 fine.
