Danes Face Tough Foe In Siena on Saturday

Harriers Notch
Double Win

by John Carter

Coach Bob Munsey's cross
countrymen took a double victory
from northern foes Plattsburg and
Potsdam State Wednesday by
23-78 and 23-48 scores respec-
tively. Highlighting the meet was
an exciting finish by Albany's ace
Dennis Hackett who passed Platts-
burgh’s Bruce Millinuin in the last
hundred yards to take first by one
second. Nick DcMarco and Pat
Gepfert took third and fourth and
Saul Rodriguez, John Stanton. and,
Bill Meehan took seventh through
ninth, respectively, to provide A1-
bany with the winning depth. The
Danes now sport an impressive 8-1
record on the year.

When Milliman jumped off to a
200 yard lead the Dane runners'
dismissed him as a “rabbit.” When
his challenge proved to be real,
Hackett had all he could do to
catch him at the finish of the 4.5
mile course. Coach Munsey said,
“That Milliman really surprised
us. Dennis did a great job catching
and passing him in one of the
most exciting races i’ve ever
seen." Understandably the Dane
mentor was pleased with his men
thus far in what should be one of
the Dane’s finest years.

The double victory gave Albany
their seventy-fifth win since cross
country began here nine years
ago. it was also Hackett's thir~
teenth personal victory giving him
an excellent chance to pass the
two men ahead of him on the all
time victory list at State, Joe
Keating (17 wins) and Tom
Robinson (22).

The Harriers are looking ahead
optimistically to their next outing
this Saturday at the Codfish Bowl
in Boston, Massachusetts.

excellent receiver as well. Stop-
ping him could be the key to our
beating Siena."

Defensively, the Indians are big
and strong. Gary Klipp, Albany
offensive center, will be lining up
opposite a middle guard who
weighs 320 pounds. Klipp weighs
in at 190. Right down the line,
State will be at a distinct weight
disadvantage.

Siena's secondary is far superior
to R.i.T.'s. Breaking through the
line was the key to Bernie Boggs’
big runs last week. The deep men
just couldn’t stop him. But it
could be a different story with
Siena. As coach Ford said, “if our
backs break through, they‘re go-
ing to have to work."

The Danes hope to be at full
strength defensively on Saturday.
Steve Finn will be starting at right
tackle, and a relative newcomer,
Jeff Wachtel, will see plenty of
action. Wachtel came out late, and
as a result is not in top condition,
but as coach Ford stated, “Fresh
off the bench, he destroys peo-
ple.”

in addition to Finn and Wach tel,
Butch McGuerty will be at right
end, John Soja at left end, and
Bob Mollenhauer will start at left
tackle, a new assignment for him.

The offense will be pretty much
as it was last week for State with
one notable exception. Look for
Ernie Thomas to get the starting
nod over Larry Petersen at the
swingback position, based pri-
marily on Thomas' outstanding

efforts in practice this week. Bill
Flanagan, Bernie Boggs, and Rudy
Vido will again round out the
State backfield. Last week Flana-
gun was cited by coach Ford for
calling an “outstanding game"
against R.l.T. He hopes to repeat
his performance this week.

As for a game plan, Albany will
again look to establish Vido in-
side. Vido rushed for 101 yards
against R.I.T., and combined with
Boggs, they comprise one of the
most productive backfields any
team on our schedule is likely
to face.

Outstanding performances were
the order of the day against R.I.T.
last Saturday, but coach Ford
made special mention of several
individuals:

Outstanding Offensive Back of the

Week: Bernie Boggs

Bernie rushed for 148 yards,
three touchdowus, and kicked
two field goals for a total of 24
points. Everything done last Week
was a record, since it was Albany’s
first game, but Bernie’s accom-
plishments could very well stand
for years to come.

Outstanding Offensive Lineman of
the Week: Peter Moore

Pete came through with crucial
blocks that led to vital yards in
the Albany offense. His desire,
determination and consistency of
play earned him special recog-
nition.

Outstanding Defensive Lineman of
the Week: Butch McGuerty

Butch spent more time in the
R.i.T. backfield than did their
running backs. Hc anchored the
right side of the Albany line,nd
broke through to make numerous
unassisted tackles. Wherever the
ball went, McGuerty was there.

Football : WhatItIs

by Dave Fink
This {a the first part of a three purl series on foolball. This
information came from a member of the team who has given up quite
a an (involvement in school government and his private life) lo play
the sport. In talking to him, it was impossible to ignore him rubbing
various scrapes and bruises. He was also kind of tired.

Last Saturday afternoon approximately 3800 people ventured down
to the football field to watch a team representing Albany State play
the first game on agridiron in the school’s 125 year history.

For most, the outcome, a decisive 30-21 victory over R.1.T., was
enough to kindle a great deal of support for the team and anticipation
for tomorrow’s Homecoming encounter with Siena.

One might wonder, however, just what the feeling would have been
had the Danes lost their opener. Would the average spectator have
criticized the players, the coaches, the team in general? indeed, if
State is not as fortunate in the oeming weeks, will this be the
sentiment? I think that an important prerequisite in understanding
this team and accepting any defeat, as well as victory, is to understand
the sacrifice that a player makes to play football.

Many members of this team have never played football before. For
them, it means learning a new game, expending energy to a greater
extent than they ever have. it means giving up many pleasures and
much time. it means, in the case of some, rushing from student
teaching assignments in order to get to practice on time. it means a
married man giving up hours during which he might earn moneyrand it
means men taking graduate courses at the university just so that they
might play.

Obviously, to sacrifice and sweat in this manner is the choice of the
individual. The fact remains, though, that this choice should be
understood.

This is a rough account of what one week is like for an Albany State
football player.

Sunday evening: Review films of previous game. After the coaches
have gone over the films, they rate each player on his performance
and he is told what he has done wrong and what he has done
correctly.

Monday: Defensive team goes through light workout while
offensive team goes over next opponent's formations and personnel
and their own game plan for the upcoming ball game. Then the
offensive team goes through an easy workout while the defense has a
similarmeeting. Then the defense joins the offense to practice kickoffs
and punts. The practice concludes with a series of wind sprints (30-40
yards) and an “up-down" drill where the players run in place and
then,on the coach's whistle, drop to the ground only to get up again
and continue running. This goes on for about 2% minutes.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday: Scrimmage type situation with
the offense first running the upcoming opponent‘s plays for the
defense and then the defense running the opponent's defense for the
offensive team (on the basis of scouting reports). There is also some
regular scrimmage (mostly on Wed.). The team then goes into the
“live or die" drill. it has been called the “nutcracker drill‘ when used
by Vince Lombardi and Allie Sherman. it entails, for example, two
linebackers taking on a blocker and a ball carrier in a confined area.
Needless to say, it is despised by the players. The practice ends with
sprints and up-downs.

Friday: An “easy” day. The team runs through the entire game plan
(plays, formations, etc.).

Saturday: Before the game, the coach goes over the personnel on the
respective teams (offense, defense and specialty), the opponent‘s
strong and weak points and what his players must do to win the game.

Practice runs from 3:45 to 5:115. A man must reach the gym by 11:00
p.m. to get taped, dressed anti talk to the coach. if a man is late for
calisthenics, he must do an extra minute of up-downs. This encourages
punctuality. Upon getting in from practice, he has until 6:30 to
shower, dress and get to Dutch Quad to eat. He can get to the library
by 7:00 pm. or 7:30 and study until 10:30 because he finds that he
must be in bed by midnight. He is usually up early.

From this account, it is obvious that playing football is not all
scoring touchdowns. When you go to watch lhc Danes take on Sicna
Saturday, keep this in mind. You might nol be so quick in yelling
"Hey number 99, you stinkl!”

Basketball Team

Begins Practice

Veteran State University at Al-
bany basketball coach Dick Sauers
greeted 13 candidates Thursday,
October 15, as workouts began
for the 1970-71 season. The squad
should be one of the deepest and
best-balanced of Sauers' 16-year
career at Albany, during which
time he has compiled a 237-113
record.

On hand will be five lettermen,
four of them starters, from last
winter’s 13-9 varisty; four sopho-
mores from the 13-5 freshman
team; and four transfers.

“We will be improved over last
year,” Sauers claims. “With a
stronger bench, we can be more
aggressive and the new players are
good scorers, which will strengt-
hen us where we were weakest last
season. We'll miss the floor leader-
ship of Jack Adams (the only
graduated starter), but i think we
have several players who could
step into that role. As of now, all
positions are open."

Returning regulars, all seniors,
are covcaptains Jack Jordan (60,
Green island), and Alan Reid (6-2,
Binghamton), both forwards; cen-
ter Sieve Shechan ((5-2, Fort Ed-
ward), and guard Jim Masterson
(6-1, Albany), Jordan led the
team in scoring (16.5) and re-
bounds (255), while Masterson
averaged 11.8 points a game, Reid
10.0, and Sheehan 8.0. Junior
John Heller (6-1, Elmira) missed
mosl of the season with an injury,
but was the leading freshman scor-
er the year before.

Up from the freshman team of
last year are Werner Kolln (6-11,
Kingston), who was the top scorer
(12.6) and rebounder (153); Dave
Wclchons (6-2, New Hartford);
Bob Obermaycr ((1-3, Rensselaer);
and Tim Minnehan (5-10, Li-
vonia). All should help.

Law Enforcement “Breakdown”

And on October 12, 1970, two
very interesting stories were on
the front page of the New York
Times. The United States Com-
mission on Civil Rights reported
that there had been a "major
breakdown" in enforcement of
federal laws against racial dis—
crimination. The Times reports
“that the White House had sought
to delay release of the report until
after the November elections."
The other article was about the
Dept, of Justich Solicitor Gen-
eral, Erwin N. Griswold’s argu-
mean against busing before the
Supreme Court. Regarding the dc-
mund for school integration, he
said, “I cannot find that in the
constitution"!

been attacked with equal mala-
droitness by the department (1.

sent Congress a new program on
hard narcotics, with emphasis on
punishment of rather than curing

Metcrology, artificial weather

out the country was the subject of
a speech presented to the faculty
wives.

Ray Falconer, research associate
at SUNYA's Atmospheric Science
Research Center (ASRC) de-
scribed the center's work in the
above mentioned fields last ’l‘ues-
day evening.

Generally known to the public
as the weatherman for a local
radio station, Falconer has been
with the ASRC since its inception
in 1061, and he considers his
primary function as managing the
Whileface Mountain field station.

Using slides as a visual aid, he
showed the work undertaken at
Whiteface in weather forecasting,
atmospheric pollution and public
lectures.

Falconer then explained in luy-
man‘s terms how the weather in-
fluences pollution as well as how
pollution can influence the
weather.

Falconer's talk was preceded by
a short speech by SUNYA's new
president Dr. Louis Benezet who
was being introduced to the facul-
ty wives.
