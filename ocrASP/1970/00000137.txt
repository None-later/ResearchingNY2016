Have you thought about spending the spring semester in

Austria, Switzerland, Costa Rica, Denmark, Puerto

Rico, France, Mexico, Italy, Greece, Germany, India,

Great Britain, Singapore, Malta, or any of the other

20 countries in which the State University of New York

sponsors academic programs?

There are over 80 semester, academic year and summer study

abroad programs open to qualified State University
students. The cost for a semester or year abroad

is comparable in many instances to expenses for the same
periods on your own campus, and your transportation costs

are reduced on University charter or group flights.

Recruitment for spring programs is now going on at all
sponsoring campuses for students who feel they can benefit
from the stimulating atmosphere of a new academic and

cultural setting while earning degree credit.
Think about it. Talk about it. See your campus
Director of International Education for details soon.

An Unorthodox

Jewish Experience

by Robert Schwartz

Al'lcr participating with over
|t)(l students in an intensely in-
spiring and stimulating Yom
Kippur scrvicc, many Jewish stu-
dents have decided that this type
of experience cannot be limited to
merely three days a year. As a
result of their Yom Kippur ex-
perience, these students have be-
gun formulating plans to meet
together on a regular basis in
order to reconstruct traditional
Jewish prayer, education, and tra-

tiuns on Campus

The Board of Trustees of the
State University of New York has
mandated that individuals who
wish to possess firearms on cam-
pus must have them registered
with a designated university offi-
ciul. SUNYA students may initiate
registratioi -cedures by visiting
the Office of the Director of
Student Activities in Campus Cen-
ter I30. ’I‘hc make, model and
identification numbers of the wea-
pon will be needed for registra-
tion. Registration must be com-
plctcd and approval given prior to
bringing the weapon on campus.

ditions into a creative and progres-
sch force which can better both
their own personal needs and the
needs of society. Their first mcct-
ing, open to all interested, will be
Wednesday Oct. '21 at 7:150.

During the Yom Kippur scrviccs,
these students, through poetry,
prayer, and the writings of such
Jewish philosophers as Abraham
Hcschcl, Erich Fromm, and
Martin Buber, critically examined
such topics as the existence of
God, the necessity and relevance
of traditional temple services, and
a redefinition of Yom Kippur
from its traditional emphasis upon
atonement for one's sins into a
day of self-reflection in order to
obtain personal growth. Despite
disagreement on this topic, all

participants commonly felt that

Judaism cannot be limited to a
pro-determined ritual of prayers
and Observances, but instead it is a
force which relates to every aspect
of one's life.

Therefore, many students desire
to reconstruct a new congregation
on campus which in drawing upon
traditional prayer, teachings, and
obscrvanccs, will enable them to
explore and study Judaism in a

Along with concentration upon
the study of Jewish culture, the
group intends to further combine
their knowledge with the tradi-
tional Jewish emphasis upon
social action in transforming
Judaism into a truly living rcli-
gion.

i Homecoming

 

Spotlight Shared

“The fraternity-sorority image
was still there, but involvement by
non-Greeks was greatly in-
creased," commented Chairman
Chuck Gibbs on Homecoming
l970.

Evidence of the new trend ap-
peared most prominently in Sat-
urday‘s Homecoming parade. Nine
of the twenty floats entered were
non-Greek and were judged within
their own "Best Non-Greek“ cata-
gory. The Livingston Hall--
Hamilton Hall entry won the com-
petition.

Other awards were given to
Kappa Delta and Gamma Delta
Chi, “Best Themc;" Psi Gamma,
“Most Imaginative Entry"; and,
for the fourth consecutive year, to
Sigma Tau Beta, “Best Greek En-
try."

Floats were judged for imagina-
tion, relationship to theme, con-
struction, and spirit. while in mo-
tion, and for appearance, imagina-
tion and theme whilc stationary.

Angela Davis Caught

By FBI in

NEW YORK-r(CPS)—Antlelﬂ
-Davis has been apprehended in a
mid-town Howard Johnson's,
apparently on an informant's tip-
off. And the New York com-
mu nity has answered her arrest by
the FBI with a warning: “Every
day Angela is in jail, at New York
City policeman will be killed.“

The message, delivered to the
FBI and media, was made the
morning after Davis‘ capture, in
the form of an anonymous phone
call.

The 26-year-old radical was ur-
raigned on the charge ofunlawful
flight for crimes of murder and
kidnapping in connection with the
attempted courtroom rescue of
twu black brothers in a San
Rafael, Calif, courtroom on Aug,
7. She allegedly bought the guns
that were used in the action, and
which killed Superior Court Judge
Harold J. Haley. Although Davis
was not present at the incident,
she is being charged with murder
and kidnap because of a California
law which makes an accomplice
liable for the full charge. She was

put on the PB] most-wanted list
Aug. 16 for fleeing across state
lines.

Bail was set at $250,000, which
she could not post. Extradition
papers have been filed in Cali-
fornia, which she is expected to
fight. Arrested with her was
Rudolph Poindcxter, a black Chi-
cagoan who has been charged with
harboring a fugitive.

Two hundred people demon-
strated in front of New York‘s
Women's House of Detention the
night of the arrest (Tues), shout-
ing “free Angela.” There were no
incidents or arrests.

Davis has been in New York for
some time, according to the word
on the streets in New York, pre-
paring to leave the country,
probably for Cuba. Her com-
panion, Poindcxter, allegedly was
heir to a large sum of money. The
FBI apparently learned of her
whereabouts from informers,
since her presence was not a se-
cret, according to sources in Hur-
Icm.

 

' By Non—Greeks

Contestants Were judged for
beauty, poise, originality, spon-
taneity and school spirit, and were
crowned at Frlday‘s Champagne
Formal and Banquet. "

"The dance was a success," ex-
plained Gibbs, "in that it was the
unusual: girls wearing dresses and
boys dressed up." The affair was
attended by over 200 persons and
was set in a Mardi Gras theme.

Other events of the Special
Events Board sponsored weekend
included a pizza parlor and
concert. Although planned, a Fri-
day night bonfire and pep rally
was cancelled due to adverse
weather conditions.

E'vcnt chairmen were Jim
Waters, for homecoming queen
contest; Judy Avner, parade chair-
man; and Judy Mazzco, formal.

Next year‘s Homecoming week-
end is tentatively scheduled for
the weekend of October 8, |97l.

Puerto Rican

Flood Aid

by Lesley Weinbla‘l

A state of emergency was
declared in Puerto Rico, last
Tuesday, after the island was
ravaged by hurricane floods the
previous weekend. Therefore, the
H5 Puerto Rican students of
SUNYA have organized in an
effort to send aid to the
unfortunate victims left homeless
by the floods. For the past week,
collections have been made of any
money, clothing and any articles
that students wished to con-
tribute. Due to the urgency of the
crisis, these collections will con-
tinue this week.

There will be a large cardboard
carton in the lobby of the Campus
Center for this purpose. Moreover,
in their attempt to collect funds,
the Puerto Rican students have
been soliciting for contributions
door-to-door. In addition, they
have planned an auction to be
held in the Campus Center, in
which articles collected during
the drive will be sold to the
highest bidder. A bake sale is in
the planning, and the revenues
from all these activities will be
sent to Puerto Rico, as will parcels
of clothing collected in the drive.

Antonio Perez, organizer of the
fund drive, stressed the urgency of
the situation, and expressed a
wish for generosity on the part of
SUNYA students. Anyone who
wishes to make any contributions
can leave his donations either at
the BOP office with Mr. Perez or
in the cardboard box at the Cam-
pus Center.
