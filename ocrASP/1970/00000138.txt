Nixon: Not Enough

 

 

   
 

A Statement By SMC

The “pane” proposal which
President Nixon outlined on Oct-
ober 7 does not in the slightest
degree represent a departure from
the basic political and military
policies of the U.S. government.
Rather, the proposal is an arro-
gant re-assertion by Washington of
its "right" to dictate to the peo-
ples of Southeast Asia the govern
ments which Washington chooses
on the terms Washington chooses-
a “right” Washington has won in
the last decade solely by waging
brutal and devastating warfare
against the peoples of Indochina.

Nixon‘s new proposal was de-
signed-like Johnson’s proposal for
“peace talks" in 1969, like
Nixon’s “Vietnamization pro-
posal, like the Cambodian in-
vasion-to buy time while the ad-
ministration continues to seek a
military victory in Southeast Asia.
As the October 8New York Times
pointed out, the proposal is not
“really new."

NIXON TODAY-~
Immediate negotiations for
cease-fire in place through-
out Indochina to be inter
nationally supervised...

NIXON ltl69--International
body acceptable to both
sides to supervise cease fires
(presumably local), plus a
cessation of combat after a
year of troop withdrawals.

Nixon’s move from an inter-
nationally-supervised cease-fire to
a cease-fire internationally super-
vised is not enough!

The anti-War movement has con-
sistently demanded the immediate
withdrawl of U.S. forces from
Vietnam and Southeast Asia. We
have seen this to be the only
demand consistent with the best
interests of the people of the US.
and of Southeast Asia. As long as
US military forces

 
 

remain in

 
 

Southeast Asia the bloodshed and
destruction will continue. We have
not been disarmed by Nixon‘s
deceiving efforts to buy time; we
will not be silent as the “dove”
congressmen and senators would
have us be.

Instead, we- will re-assert our
demand for the total and im-
mediate withdrawl of all U.S. for-
ces from Southeast Asia by join-
ing with other Americans from all
walks of life in massive anti-war
demonstrations on Salurday. Oct-
ober 3!. In Albany. the Student
Mobilization Committee is work-
ing with other anti-war groups and
individuals who are sponsoring an
anti-war demonstration on that
day. All people interested are
asked to assemble at 11 a.m. with
banners and signs at Draper Hall.
Transportation for SUNY stud-
ents who would need a ride to the
downtown campus will be pro-
vided. The march will proceed
down Western Avenue to the steps
of the Capital Building where
there will be anti-war speakers and
presentations.

This action will be a massch and
visible display of popular dis-
satisfaction with Nixon's phony
peace plans and in favor of the
demand to “Bring All the Troops
Home Now!" It is a forthright
assertion of the fact that despite
the government's efforts to sup-
press dissent tlirough Agnew's
polarizing rhetoric and through
the government's brutal suppress-
ion aiid victimization of political
activists, the iiichnient is not
stifled but growing, We are here.

In Defense Of Liberalism

 

 

 

by Bob Warner

1970 America, a highly polarized nation politically. seems to shun
progressivism or liberalism in favor of either the politics of rotation .0...
radicalism. This country, then. is unwdling t0 WASH-“HY “3 refs.“
grievances: the social injustices, economic‘ineqUulitics. and political
oppression. Both the right and the left are in Violent combat with one
another. I

Both extremes, however. do agree on their common enemy. the
liberal. The liberal is termed “radie‘lib” who is “soft on crime and
disorder" (in the old days he was soft on communism).  well as a
naive stumbling block to the revolution. The reactionary Nixomte has
blamed liberals since the New Deal for disorder, moral disintegration
of youth. the violation of private enterprise, and for the raising. of
hopes of the black man. so that now he expects complete equality.
And it is the liberal who shelters the radicals from oppressmn, and
who taught their children to behave as such.

The radicals, though. must get rid of the liberal, because as long as
progress continues and democracy is broadened. the total revolution-
ary sweep of America will never happen. The liberal, to some more
dogmatic leftists. is a phony, as in Phil Och’s "Love Me I‘m a Liberal."
To some more generous radicals. though, he is just naive and
misguided. Therefore, the liberal is in a bind; or at least. his position is
sadly in the minority.

What liberals are attempting and have been doing in the past is to
consistently strive towards perfection, though never expecting it; to
do this, there must be an evolutionary trend based on a democratic
tradition that always builds upon democracy. The liberal denies the
conservative and reactionary viewpoints which try to either maintain
the status quo or return to the past; the holders of such a philosophy
usually have some political. economic. or social stake in the
maintaining of privileges or at least have something to lose.

The radical, however, will accept nothing but revolution (most
likely, bloody) on the assumption that what exists now is so bad that
amything following must be better. He refuses to understand. firstly.
that in any bloody confrontation. the forces of reaction“)! ruPres-“'10”
will always win because of their violent ethic and tremendous power.
Secondly, once a revolution is accomplished (which is hypothetical),
it will take repression to battle counter»revolution. This is a bloody
cycle. In a revolutionary or reactionary ethic. democracy will never
win out, compared to an evolutionary system.

It is doubtful, then. that the liberals and radicals differ in their
causes; the schism lies in the means to obtain the ideal goals. and at
what pace change will occur.

The radical's strategy is to bring on the revolution by provoking
repression and an ensuing police state. Their strategy has no place for
liberals. reformers. or progressives, because they will only slow the
inevitable tide of history which is in the radical's favor.

The rationale for the ensuing revolution after the fascist state
becomes a reality, is that the people will rally behind radicalism to
unshackle their oppressors.. History, however, disproves that. The
American people tolerated Lincoln's martial law. A. Mitchell Palmer's
severely repressive reign as Attorney General during Harding's corrupt
administration. and Governor Huey Long of Louisiana, America
today. is widely accepting and even pushing for repressive “anti-
crime" hills which are, of course, a guise for the suppression of
anti-administralion activists. And as stated above. America will
support repression; therefore. in any violcnt struggle in this country.
fascism will prevail. The tragic story of Greece should suffice as a
lesson.

The liberal's alternative. then, is the electoral priit'css. i.c. the
Democratic Party. since the radical's creed of violence is not tolcrablc
at this stage in history. The liberal also accepts the reality that not
everything he wants will be. realized immediately. l“urthcrmorc.
liberalism is based on the premise that political. social. and t-conomlc
progress can oiin be built upon the principles of an evolutionary
'(lemocracy.

HOPE HOUSE

The Hope House is a personal
rehabilitation center for drug ad-
dicts. It's twenty members rely on
their guts, perseverance and con-
cern for each other to learn how
to onee again become a useful
part of society. Hope House is not
another merry-go-round for ad-
dicts. The program offers no
sympathy for the addict, just the
chance to pick up the pieces and
start over again, Moreover. [he
addict must help himself before
the Hope House will accept him as
a member.

To become a member of the
Hope House is not an easy task.
Before an ntltllcl. will even be

explained this selection process by
saying. “We deal with people. not

Althouin they were addicts, the
members agree that drugs were
only a symptom of their prob

members to accch themselves as

Furthermore, the program has no

to proceed at his or her own pace.
