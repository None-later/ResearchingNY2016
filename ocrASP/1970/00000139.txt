Sergio Mendez and his Brazil
'66 presented an outstanding
concert of great rhythmic
sounds on Saturday, October
17, for Homecoming Weekend,

This concert revealed Brazil
‘66 to be more than two beauti-
ful girls with unique voices and
an accompanying group of good
percussionists and drummers.
They blended the piano, drums,
and tambourines with the voices
to produce a rendition of “Go-
ing Out of My Head," which has
never sounded quite as good on
record because the instruments
are not usually as outstanding as
the voices.

Sergio Mendez accompanied
many of the pieces, and the
delicate sound of his electric
piano created a beautiful con-

 

trast with the heavy Brazilian
beat. The girls' orange, brown,
and white maxi dresses swayed
as they danced to the exciting
rhythm. Throughout the per-
formance the entire gym vi-
brated with the constantly
changing tempos of the South
American music. One member
of the group became so caught-
up in the rising crescendo of
musical fire that he tossed down
his instrument in order to ex-
press himself in an intricate
Brazilian dance.

Towards the end of the con-
cert the performers surprised
the audience with the Beatle’s
“Something” and “Day Trip-
per." Both were done in the
familiar Mendez style, with the
emphasis on the voices, which
were both powerful and re-
sounding.

They also delighted the audi-

ence with two of their best-
known songs, “The Look of
Love" and “The Fool on the
Hill." in "Fool," Sergio played
his electric piano with appro-

priate subtlety. The audience ex-

pressed its enthusiasm and ap-
preciation by demanding three
encores, all of which the per-
formers were happy to provide.
These included “Scarborough
Fair" and “Easy to be Hard."

Scales and Croft entertained
in the manner of Simon and
Garfunkle: that is, with empha-
sis on folk and folk-rock. How-
ever, either the ustics or the
performers themselves were in
poor condition Saturday night.
since many of their words were
garbled. They had a nice “folk”
sound on the whole, but it was
often difficult trying to dis-
tinguish what sounds the folk
Were trying to produce.

Danes Whip Siena, 25—24; Rank 4th in State

by Mike Piechowicz

Albany State added another in-
stallment in their tale of David
and Goliath with a 25-24 home-
coming victory over Siena. It was
the second win of the season
without a loss for the surprisingly
strong Great Danes.

The Albany offense was again
keyed by hard running tail-back,
Bernie Boggs, who churned out
159 yards, one touchdown, a field
goal, and two extra points.

Despite only a one point margin,

Boaters Lose To Plattsburg;

the game was no 'heart-breaker‘
for Siena. Their fate was sealed
from the second play from scrim-
mage, when Boggs exploded from
just over midfield to the Indian
eleven. Three plays later, tailback
Rudy Vido took it in.

Siena went into the locker
room, however, with the only lead
they were to hold. The Albany
defense yielded to Sat Guido, who
toppled into the end zone with
3:58 left in the first half, and a
daring fake kick went for the two

day and were treated quite in-
hospitably, coming away on the
short end of a 5-0 score.

Obviously, State couldn’t mus-
ter much of an offensive through-
out the garne. This has been the
team‘s problem for the past few
weeks.

The score was only 1-0 at half-
time with the lone goal resulting
from a penalty kick by the north-
erners‘ forward Ricky Graves. AI-
bany seemed to collapse in the
third period, however, as Platts-
burg registered four more goals,
including two by the home club's
star forward Bill Garvy and one
more by Gravos.

Coach Bill ‘Schieffelin felt that
goaltender John Thayer played
another fine game. in order to
gain more offensive punch,
Schieffelin moved captain Joel
Volinski from fullback to center
halfback. J0cl promptly pulled a
hamstring muscle and thus, his
effectiveness was considerably less-
scncd. Meanwhile center forward
Fred Campbell’s offensive efforts
were effectively thwarted by
Plattsburg as he was double-
teamed throughout the game.
Coach Schieffelin said, “The de-
fense played very well. They
didn't make any real mistakes.
You only have to look at the final
score to see the real problem."
State will try to get back on the
Winning road Wednesday when
they travel to Hamilton College
and then on Saturday will venturc
south to Stony Brook.

STB ClinchesLeague I Title
For Second Straight Year

by Bob Zaremba

With a 6-6 tie against l’nttcr
Club, STB clinched their second
straight League I championship
yesterday afternoon, with one
game remaining in their season's
schedule.

The Club went into the game
with only one loss and one tic,
while STB was undefeated and
untied. A win for EEP was a must
if the league crown was to remain
in doubt.

STB scored first on a one yard
pitch out to Jay llandclman early
in thr- first hall'. The extra point
was wide and the score stood 6-0.
The rest of the half saw no deep
penetration by either team.

The second half opened with
very little action until Jack Adams
dropped a punt. snap on his own it
and STB prepared to sew things
up. The first call was the pitch
play, but this time Potter Club's
John Wilcox was there instead of
llandelman, and ran 02 yards with

the intercepted lateral. That tied
things up but Art Dixon's attempt
at the extra point was off to the
left.

The momentum shifted and STB
had to give up the ball but it soon
became clear that the Club wasn't
going to move anywhere. Quarter-
back Larry Myers and STB took
over on their own 15 with less
than three minutes remaining. A
tu- alone wou'ld have clinched the
championship but Larry went the
win and put the ball in the air. He
got his club down to the EEP 15,
and with one second left lofted a
pass that was hauled in by Tom
Sears, but only after it had been
swiped at by his own man, making
it incomplete.

Then it was all over, and the
crowd marched sullcnly off as if it
had never begun. Partly because a
tie leaves one rather limp, and
partly because they didn't get to
hear the Potter post-game sports-
manship cheer.
