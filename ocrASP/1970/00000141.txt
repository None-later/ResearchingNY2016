Kent State Speech
Urges Non-Vhience

The following is the text of the speech delivered by Craig Morgan
Tuesday night, October 2!). Morgan is the President of the Student
Association of Kent State and was amongin 25 indicted by [lie Ohio

grand jury.

I would like to address myself
briefly to the nation as a whole,
not to those student and faculty
members who already agree with
us, but to those students who are
apprehensive about the concerns
expressed, it. is understandable
how much a college education
means to you. This opportunity
may seem too precious to jeopard-
ize by becoming involved in what
tippcars to be extra-curricular act-
tvilies.

But let me ask, once you have
your degree what. kind ofa life do
you want to lead? Do you support
a political system based on trust
and reconciliation, or will you
accept political rhetoric which di-
vides and polarizes your country
and turns the resultant. fears into
hatred for unpopular minority
groups?

We all understand the pressure
which exists in a giant university.
Sympathy must be given to those
who fear that the system may
reject them altogether, through
the tyranny of grade-point aver-
age, bringing catastrophe to future
careers and personal advance-
merits.

But we ask each student, if he
can find it in his conscience to
take the risks inherent in becom-
ing involved in the greater issues
which threaten tragedy to our

tradition of freedom and equality.

To this end, we at. Kent are
asking for a nationwide mora-
torium on business as usual. We
are asking that for one day stu-
dents don't go to classes, don't
spend their time drinking beer or
playing football, but spend the
(lay talking among themselves,
with faculty members, with their
parents, and with college adminis-
trators about. what is happening to
us, about what is happening to
civil liberties in America today.
We are asking that students across
the nation demonstrate their uni-
ty in whatever manner they de-
sire, whether that. be by fasts,
teach-ins, rallies or whatever: with
only one restriction, it must be
done non-violently. There are
politicians in this nation who are
banking on a violent upheaval on
any campus in America in order
to get. themselves eleCted. We
can’t give them that opportunity.
Any one who doesn‘t see that. is
politically blind.

in addition, the student govern-
ment of Kent State University
calls upon University communities
and other citizens across the
country to show their concerns
over increasing political repression
though a manifestation of unity
on October 81 by participating in
the non-violent mass demonstra-
tion throughout the country.

Soul Food Kitchen
Center of Friendship

A deeply concerned and
involved citizen of Albany's North
End ghetto will talk with students
here on Monday evening at 7:30
pm. in the Campus Center Ass-
embly Hall.

Pete Jones is a black man who
grew up in the ghetto and knows
what it is like to be a hungry and
ill-clad child. Through his success-
ful establishment of a soul-food
kitchen next-door to the Palace
Theatre at. 168 North Pearl Street,
Pete has been able to facilitate
and subsidize the feeding of sixty
school-age children every day, He
calls his restaurant. "Our Pluce,“a
center of activity and friendship
amidst. the depression of the
North End Ghetto.

WSUA, the student radio slut-
ion, studied Pete's situation and
agreed with him that the involve-
ment and support of the student
body at Albany State could be
vital in energizing funds and fuc-
ililies. in addition, students from
Bethlehem High School have been
helping Pete build a day-care cen-
ter on the floor above his restaur-
ant; this project, too, needs more
student participation.

Jones will bring some of his
volunteers and children in the
program and show slides and rap
about the problems of the ghetto,
his programs, and the history of
shameful neglect on the part. of
local, state, and federal govern-
mean which make community
action a last resort. Hopefully,
students will respond to the idea
of community-involvement. cs-
pccially since this involvement
was realized as urgan during last
semester's political upheaval and
rc-cxumination of thc Univursity‘s
purpusc.

Jury Not Representative

 

PAGE 3

Bowen Case to be Appealed

by Terry Wolf

On the grounds that the jury
was not representative, Michael
Fcit, defense attorney for Vernon
Bowen, is challenging the Albany
Police Court’s decision and Judge
Tcpedino's maximum sentence of
one year in prison stemming out
of charges from an incident last
year. Excluded from the jury, he
protested, Were the young, the
Black, and the lower socio-
economic groups.

Vernon P. Bowen, a sophomore
at Albany, currently out on $l500
bail, is going ahead with plans to
appeal his September 8th sentence
as a result of the incident. in the
Colonial Quad cafeteria on April
15th. Bowen was arrested in May
on three accounts: harrussment for
pushing another student Colonial
Quad, criminal mischief for break-
ing the glass in the food display
case, and theft of services for
stealing a meal. Judge 'i‘epedino
pronounced him guilty of the first
charge without a jury opinion. At
this time Bowen's lawyer was
Jonathan Harvey. The last count
was dismissed since it was held

that all three actions could not.
have occurred at. the same time.

At 6:30 pm. on Friday, Sep-
tember 4th, the six member jury
delivered a verdict of guilty of
criminal mischief and sentence
was passed. Vernon spent Labor
Day weekend in the Albany
County Jail. the bail had been
revoked although Foil said he had
produced a Certificate of Reason-
able Doubt signed by Supreme
Court Justice Edward S. Conway
who set the bail at $1500. The
court issued a dctuiner on the
grounds that Vernon. during the
summer, had violated probation
resulting from a charge made
three years ago. One week later
another hearing took place and
the detainer was withdrawn. Be-
fore the Court now is a Notice of
Appeals and an Affaduvit of Er-
rors. A brief is being researched
by Feil and the trial is tentatively
scheduled for November.

John Kaufman, a friend of
Bowen's, described some of the
complaints surrounding the trial
ttnd sentence. Objections were
raised with the fact that Vernon

was only one of 72 identified and
that he was deliberately cited be-
cause of his association with the
Panthers. The most conflict,
however, centered around the
jury. Both Kaufman and Feit
pointed out. that of the six jurors,
five of whom were female, all
were over 50 years of age, while,
and four worked for New York
State. This raised some censure
because the charges were brought
against Vernon by the Slate.
Another argument is that the
three witnesses for the prosecu-
tion were white while the de-
fense‘s witnesses were four Blacks
who testified that Bowen was in
the lecture center at the time of
the incident. Also questioned was
the sentence. One year is the
maximum term and to some this
appears to be too harsh.

The issue, Kaufamn summar-
ized, was not Vernon’s guilt or
innocence, but the manner in
which the case was dealt with.
Kaufman, one of the leaders in
the collection of bail for Bowen,
said that. much more money will
be needed to further Vernon’s
appeal.

New Outlook For Campus Center
Podium Extension the Solution

by Roy S. Lewis

As the SUNYA student popula-
tion grows, Gary Jones is faced
with a cumbersome problem. As
director of the Campus Center,
Jones must find new and imagina-
tive outlets to successfully accom-
modate the large volume of stu-
dents utilizing Campus Center
facilities. In answering this need,
both immediate and future plans
have been drawn up.

One of the special problems of
the Campus Center is the availa-
bility of space to the many groups
on campus, especially during sea-
sons of peak activity. Already
many Campus Center functions
have been diverted to the Lecture
Center Compch through the
office of the Registrar. The Bru-
bacher facilities downtown have
also been booked for various
meetings and groups.

The shortage of office space for
Student Association activities is
becoming critical. Jones pointed
out that WSUA and the Albany
Student Press were the last groups
on campus to roceivc additional
spaci- in tltc prusont building. "it
is lllt' policy of the Campus Cen-
ter lo maintain a healthy balance
bt-th-t-n office and I't-crt'nlitinul
spat-v," saitl Jones.

lounge and cafeteria space during
lunch hours. The present facilities
are inadequately prepared to ban
dlc such a large volume.

An immediate experimental so-
lution to some of these problems
will come about very shortly. On
Friday and Saturday nights, the
Campus Center building plans to
remain open until ll a.m. with the
Snack Bar Facilities operating un~
til 2 arm. The only areas which
will not have extended hours will
be the Patroon Lounge and the
l’atroon Room Restaurant. These
experimental hours will continue
through this scittester and hope-
fully they will allow thc Campus
Center to accommodate more
people on the weekends.

The future outlook of the Cam»
pus Center is brighl.'1‘hc five-level
'Wcst-cntl extension of the Aca-
demic Podium will include blocks
of space for Student Association
activities. The Space Committee

 

on campus will designate this
space as they see fit. In addition,
expanded food service facilities
are planned which will be
equipped to cuter special func-
tions.

Jones also pointed out that
questionnaires are distributed in
the spring to groups for Campus
Center reservations for the follow-
ing year. Each group is directed to
any one of six specialists in order
to help them plan their activity.

One final immediate outlook for
the Campus Center is the plan by
the Campus Center Governing
Board to redecorate the Snack
Bar. A special committee is now
investigating student preference
and any pllins for a change must
be upprovod by the Board, the
Director, the Architects and the
Plan Office. If approved, Jones
hopes to complete the redecora-
tion during the extended Christ-
mnavnonlinn
