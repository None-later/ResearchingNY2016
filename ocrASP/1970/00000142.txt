CAMINO REAL was ﬁrst per-
formed on Broadway in l953. As
a play, it is artistically inferior to
Williams‘ previous work - namely,
A STREETCAR NAMED DE-
SIRE and THE GLASS MENA-
GERIE‘ Those were lightly struc-
tured. dynamic plays; CAMlNO
appears lax in comparison. It
drags. Williams. in a fit ol' self-
iiidulgeiiec. allows his cliaiacters.
especially in the last act (oi
blocks). to rliapsodi/e. when they
should be wrapping things up.
Allowing for the poetic. lyrical
effect Williams was aiiiiirtg for. it
remains true that t'AMth) tends
to bore people.

To avoid this. director Joseph
Balfior might have deleted some

.of the more turgid lines in the
play, He did not. Many of the
characters are allowed to praltle
on endlessly: thus. all semblance

of movement within the play is
