Restoration] has begun in the State Quad suite in Eastman Tower
which was the scene of a ﬁre last spring.

Epilogue

Today, the condition of Colo-
nial Quad Flag'room is much the
same as that of last May according
to Nancy Wightman, Assistant Re-
sidence Director. The suite on the
fourteenth floor of Eastman
Tower. is being restored now.

The Dormitory Authority of
New York, which owns both
buildings, has completed only
very preliminary restoration.

Last May, a fire bomb was
thrown into the Flagroom causing
$35.00 worth of damage. during
the summer, action was taken to
restore the Flagroom.

First, the insurance adjuster
came to assess the extent of
damages. A request for restoration
was then made to various con-
struction firms. The contract was
eventually awarded by means of a
sealed bid, to the firm of
McManus, Longe, and BrockwcH
of Latham. ‘ _

The fire that destroyed a suite In
Eastman Tower began in a single
room and then spread to the rest
of the suite. This damage was so

.. .goodman

on Fires

extensive as to require the aid oi
an outside agency,

At this moment, the work in the
Flagroom has been of a very
preliminary nature according to
William Tisdale, Assistant to the
President in the division of Plant
Planning and Development.
Smoke damage, inflicted last May,
proved a formidable obstacle to
the repainting of the walls. The
vinyl wall coverings have been
removed and the lighting system
must be refixed since the ceiling
which anchors the lighting system
was destroyed in last May's fire.
Mr. Tisdale indicated that he
hopes the work will be completed
within six weeks.

Meanwhile. the work in the
Eastman Tower suite is being
done on a similar time schedule.
The windows are in, and the door
casings are now fixed. Also, the
suite has been painted. Judy
Condo, the State Dormitory
Director, voiced the hope that the
suite will be ready for occupancy
by next semester.

Meal Price Hike
Predicted by Haley

by Joan chkerman

Responding to an invitation to air grievances, approximately sixty
Dutch Quad residents met with Food Service representative ’Peter
Haley Wednesday night.

The meeting was sponsored by Dutch Quad Board as their first
session of Firing Line, an attempt to bring various speakers onto the
quad to discuss services available to the campus and to answer student
questions. In the future, they hope to present representatives from
Student Health Service, University Counseling Center and Refer.

Wednesday night's meeting focused on several problems with the
Food Service on Dutch and attempts of the recently organized Food
Committee to deal with student complaints. To date, the food
committee has instituted weekly meetings with the chef in charge to
discuss the menu and to represent student opinion. As a result of
these meetings, scrambled eggs are now being served until 8:80 and

' the kitchen has been offering a more varied menu.

Haley revealed that because of Food Service attempts to keep pace
with the spiraling food costs (in some cases, almost double those of
eighteen months ago) and their desire to bring student employee
salaries more in line with the current minimum wage of $1.85,
students should anticipate a raise in contract meal rates starting in
September.

Haley also stated that, for the first time, students may be allowed to
alter, though not break, their meal contract plans. After Thanksgiving
recess, those students wishing to drop a meal (other than dinner) or
add one they are not now contracted for, will be able to do so. Details
will be announced as soon as the proposal is approx/ed.

Among the quesitons raiSed by students was the reasoning beltian
mandatory contract dinner for all dorm residents. l-Iulcy answered
that. Food Service was not responsible for that regulation, that it was
part of the contract between the residence office and Food Service. A
student told the group that the question of breaking meal contracts is
coming up on the University Senate's agenda. When asked about the
success of the newly installed dividers in the dining halls, he said that
according to the more than fifteen hundred students he has spoken
with this year, there has been both a decrease in he number of
students being served and an improvement in the efficiency of the line
servrce.

Haley concluded the session by stating that there now are food
committees on all three uptown quads (Colonial Quad will have its
first meeting today at one o’clock) and invited all students to bring

any complaints to his office at Fulton Hall.

 

date for his MA. in history and
political science at Butler Univer-
sity in Indiana. He has also at-
tended seminars on group therapy
and drug abuse.

As for employment, the future
Director of Security is now Asso-
ciate Director of the Indianapolis
Human Rights Commission, re-
sponsible for the areas of housing
and police-community relations.
Earlier, Mr. Williams was a Senior
Parole Officer for the Indiana
Department of Corrections, coun-
selling parolees and investigating
criminal activities. He was also a
caseworker for the Department of
Public Welfare.

Unlike many of the other candi-
dates interviewed, Mr. Williams
has had no military intelligence
experience in Southeast Asia. He
has, however, served as naval of-
ficer aboard an oceanographic re-
search vessel. At present, he is a
lieutenant in the US. Naval Re-
serve.

Mr. Williams is expected to
come to this area during the first
part of December to assume the
post of Director of Security,
according to Mr. John Buckhoff, a
member of the Search Committee.

The Director of Security is a
new position on each of the
SUNY campuses. It is part of a
general improvement of security
thoughout the system, stimulated
by last spring's unrest.

The Search Committee, in addi-
tion to recommending Mr.
Williams as Director of Security,
recommended the formation of
two committees: an Advisory
Committee on University Security
to cover the areas of policies and
procedures, and a University Se-
curity Review Committee to con»
sider grievances and complaints
about Security.

Revolutw' 

of Workers Probed

by Linda UIsh

“Workers have to take a Revolu-
tionary role" was the theme on an
SDS meeting held Wednesday

night. Two representatives from

RPI informed a small group of the
history, goals, and objectives of
the national and local organiza-
tion, which are according to Dave
Schop to "materially and concre-
tely attack war, racism, and male
chauvinism. "

The representatives from the
RPI chapter of the SDS explained
the national objectives of the
march planned in Detroit for Elec-
tion Day. Their goals or slogans
are 1) Elections are hoaxes, 2)
US. out of SE. Asia, 3) Cops out
of the ghettos, 4) Support Strike
of the auto workers and an addi-
tional one of 5) Freeing political
prisoners. Detroit is considered a
good area in which to have such a
march because of the auto
workers‘ strike and the high an-
employment in the area.

Participants will march and can-
vass and show their support of the
striking auto workers with a
march on the GM general head-
quarters starting
Statc and the Dodge auto factory.

Draft Course

A course aimed at teaching in-
terested persons the mechanics
and information necessary to
becoming a draft counselor, will
be offered, through the Draft
Counseling Center here, sometime
in the next few weeks.

All those students who have
signed up for the course will be
notified at least one full week
prior to the first session.

For any further informa~
tion, the phone number of the
Draft Counseling Center is
4157-4009.

from Wayne .

The SDS has “concrete goals" and
they wish to unite with the
Workers on these goals.

At RPI, SDS is trying to remove
ROTC from the campus and to
get a day-care center established
on campus. They also wish to
further their national goals.

At this time there is no SDS
chapter at SUNYA. The National
Organization of SDS is now just
gaining back strenght after their
split. Anyone wishing information
about SDS or the trip to Detroit
should call Dave Schop at
274-8752.

Have you thought about spending the spring semester in

Austria, Switzerland, Costa Rica, Denmark, Puerto
Rico, France, Mexico, Italy, Greece, Germany, India,
Great Britain, Singapore, Malta, or any of the other

20 countries in which the State University of New York

sponsors academic programs?

There are over 80 semester, academic year and summer study

abroad programs open to qualified State University
students. The cost for a semester or year abroad

is comparable in many instances to expenses for the same
periods on your own campus, and your transportation costs

are reduced on University charter or group flights.

Recruitment for spring programs is now going on at all
sponsoring campuses for students who feel they can benefit
from the stimulating atmosphere of a new academic and

cultural setting while earning degree credit.
Think about it. Talk about it. See your campus
Director of International Education for details soon.
