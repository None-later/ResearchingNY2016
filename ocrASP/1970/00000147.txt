tion for all your contact needs.
Preparing, cleansing, and soak-
ing.

Lenslne is an “isotonic” solu—
tion very much like the natural
fluids of your eye, so, just a drop
or two before you insert your
contacts, coats and lubricates
the lens assuring you of a
smoother, non-irritating surface.

Cleaning your contacts with
Lenslne retards the build—up of
foreign deposits on the lenses
because Lenslne is sterile, sell-
sanitizing, and antiseptic.

Finally, storing your contacts
in Lenslne between wearings
prevents the growth of bacteria
on the lenses, a sure cause of
eye irritation. With Lenslne, you
get a storing/soaking case for
proper lens hygiene.

 

Twenty-five cents is all you
need to make your costly contact
lenses worth what you paid for
them. How? Just fill out the
coupon below and send in your
twenty-five cents for a sample
bottle of Lenslne, and a lens
case. Lensine lets your contacts
be the convenience they were
designed to be. And more.

Canadian Crisis

Present Dilemma Explained f;  

Continued from page one

of federal and provincial govern -
mental puppets."

Reference in the manifesto was
made to Premier Rober Bourassa’s
promise to provide 100,000 new
jobs in Quebec by 1971. The
document states: “Bourassn will
mature in the year ahead when he
sees 100,000 revolutionary work-
ers organized and armed." "We
are fed up and so are more and
more Quebecois with a spineless
government which makes one
thousand and one somersaults to
charm American millionaires
while begging them to come and
invest in Quebec..."the manifesto
says.

Tuesday, Oct. 6, Sharp in-
formed the abductors that the
federal government would in no
way comply with the ransom de-
munds. But he added he was ready
to make some kind of deal. And
Tuesday night the government an-
nounced its agreement with
Ottawa that the ransom price
wuudl be impossible to meet. At
the same time, lawyer Robert
Lemieux, legal counsel for many
“Felquistcs,” held his first press
conference. The conferences
turned into daily events with up
to 300 reporters from all over the
world attending. Lemieux said,
and reiterated, that the govern-
ment was playing games—it pro-
fessed to wanting negotiations but
kept up its intense police hunt. He
also continually emphasized that
the FLQ had resorted to the
guerillu tactics of kidnapping be-
cause of the way their colleagues
had been treated in court.

Pierre-Paul Geoffrey, for ex-
ample, was sentenced to an un
prccedentcd (anywhere in North
America) 124 life sentences-z"
5,850 years in jail. In addition,
Lcmicux noted testimony from
delegates to the FLQ trials from
the International League of the
Rights of Man which indicated
that the men had been convicted,
not for specific crimes, but for
their political views.

'i‘ucsdny night a second com-
muniquc was received by radio
station CKAC in Montreal from
the FLQ stating if the demands
were not met. by 8:30 a.m. Wed-
nesday “We will do away with
him." The same evening Prime
Minister 'l‘rudcau said “The will of
the minority cannot be imposed
on the majority by force." Wed-
nesday, us tensions mounted, Jns~
ticn Mini star .Iuromc Clioqucttc,
in an appeal to gain sympathy for
thr- Quubac government, asked the
kidnappers of Cross to cull hitn to
negotiate. The some day another
conununiquc was found that ex-
tvndcd Lil" ransom deadline until
Thursday midnight. 'l‘lic FLQ snid
ll Would not negotiate with the
government, but it askcd the fed-
crnl government which of its seven
demands the government found
unrcnsolutblc.

in an attempt to spare (irtiss's
life, a further deadline was set.

(in Friday, Montreal police ro-
voulcd they were searching for five
prime suspects and on Saturday
they announced no stops lutd boon
tnkun by the federal penitentiary
authorities to prepare the ex-
change of the prisoners for Cross.

 

Last date to make up a grade
of Incomplete is Friday, No-
vember 20, 1970.

Saturday, Oct. 10, Premier
Bourassa issued an initial ultima-
tum saying none of the demands
of the FLQ would be met by the
government and he announced a
final proposition to the kid-
nappers saying if they “gave them-
selves up and returned the British
official unharmed they would be
given safe passage out of the
country.

The FLQ reply to this proposal
was not long in coming. Thirty-
five minutes later Quebec Labour
Minister Pierre Luporte joined the
ranks of the kidnapped in the
hands of the FLQ. The Minister
was taken by two men armed with
machine guns as he was playing
football on his front lawn.

Laporte's capture was followed
by another communique Sunday
morning from the FLQ. The hand-
written note revealed the second
kidnapping had not been carried
out. by the original cell of the
PLO, but by a group identifying
itself as the Chenier cell. Although
at this point, the price of Cross's
life ahd been reduced to the re-
lease of the 23 political prisoners,
and the cessation of police activi-
ties with respect to the kid-
nappings, the price set for Laporte
was somewhat stiffer it was made
up of all seven initial demands of
the FLQ. A further communique
Monday confirmed that if the
demands were met the hostages
would not be executed.

In the meantime, lawyer
Lcmieux, named by the FLQ at;
their negotiator, was arrested in
his room at the Poison Hotel in
Montreal on charges of obstruc-
tion of justice. He was released on
Tuesday morning after a hearing
in court.

That same day hundreds of
heavily armed Canadian troops
were brought into Ottawa to pro—
tcct cabinet ministers. diplomats,
prominently wealthy people and
federal buildings from possible
FLQ attacks. As malty as 1,000
troops entered the capital from
camp Pctawuwu Sunday night,
Thousands of troops were trucked
into the Montreal area from New
Brunswick and others were frown
in from Saskatchewan. Troops
have been guarding any prominent
building for the last six days in
Montreal and police began raiding
homes of sympathizers of the
FLQ and suspected FLQ members
at the same time. The arrest toll
rose to 351 following passage of
the War Measures Bill in the
House of Commons at If n.m.

‘Friday morning.

Police Immediately took advan-
tage of the situation to clean out
all left-wing groups in Montreal
that they’d wanted to get at; since
Drapeau warned last year of I
revolutionary conspiracy in the
city where he is mayor. The police
went after radical press shop:
(they smashed equipment in at
least three), draft dodgers, deser-
ters, radical Vietnamese student:
and militant workers committees.
For safekeeping, they also
rounded up a selection of lawyers,
journalists, singers, and doctors.

Friday afternoon, with the war
measures act in force all negotia-
tions broke down between FLQ
and the government. Lemieux
signed as the FLQ negoitator,
making it clear that he thought
the government would not nego-
tiate, he called the government's
actions hysterical. The action
taken by the Trudeau government
"shouldn't affect any peaceful de-
mocratic Canadian," federal Jus-
tice Minister John Turner said in
a press interview Friday.

What about the mounting
arrests in the Montreal and
Quebec city area, he was asked.
“The Attorney General in that
province must have had some rea-
son to suspect them," he said with
a grin. Since the War Measures Bill
was put into effect, theTrudcau
government has been given Verbal
support from Premiers Robarts of
Ontario, Smallwood of New-
foundland, Thatcher of Saskatche—
wan, and Storm of Alberta. But
the Measures of the government
have brought strong opposition as
well from many labour and stu—
dent and welfare groups across the
country.

FSA is planning to build an exclusive restaurant for VlP‘s and
campus dignitaries at the top of Mohawk Tower.

Mohawk Tower Site
Of VIP Restaurant

by Mary Ann Meyer

A new V.I.P. special occasion
dining room will be built into the
Mohawk Tower in the Indian
Quadrangle. It will occupy half of
the twenty-second and twenty-
third stories, which will be com-
bined into one high ceiling floor.

Council Questions
Construction Plan

Central Council questioan
John Buckhoff, the Director of
Plant Services on campus, con-
cerning future construction pro-
jccts.

Buckhoff described plans which
he termed immediate, for the cre-
ation of parking lots on either side
of the Academic Podium near
Dutch and Colonial Quads. The
two lots will be depressed so that
traffic will not flow in this area.
Plans also call for a roof to be
constructed between the quads
and the podium.

The object of these parking
facilities is to provide closc purk-
ing for faculty, stuff and visitors
to the campus during the business
day. Although the priorities for
this area have not been set, they
will probably be used by students
only at night or on weekends.

Temporary parking lots on the
grassy sitc behind the Biology
building would be covered with u

gravel substance to prevent the
degeneration of the lots into
swamps. The "temporary" Colo-
ninl Quad parking lot is to be
covered with this substance too.

In answer to the frequent cries
of Colonial residents as to why
the parking lot is not black-
toppcd, Buckhoff revealed that a
long range plan calls or the con-
struction of a building for parking
on that site. Buckhoff explained
that the reason why this project is
so far in the future is because the
state will not authorize such an
expenditure.

The problem of student repre-
sentation on committees deter-
mining construction und priorities
was strongly presented to Buck-
hoft‘ by Council members. Buck-
hoff explained that the program is
the child of the Master Plan,
where representation is still in u
developmental stage.

that the original idea was to
answer the need for a more formal
dining area to serve such groups as
visiting dignitaries, conferences,
etc. He also added that the room
might also be used by the students
for their more formal social func-
tions.

The room, which will be able to
accomodutc approximately 100
people, will be furnished with a
better grade of tables, chairs,
linen, and china designed especial-
Iy to follow the Mohawk lndian
motif of the quadrangle.

Food will be sent by elevator to
an adjacent holding pantry
equipped with hot plates, refriger-
ator and grill. The regular quad
kitchen will service the dining
room. Completion of construction
is planned for the Fall of 1971.
