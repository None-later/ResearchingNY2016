Dr. Salvador Allende, a Marxist-Leninist, was formally elected
President of Chile by a joint session of Congress, last Saturday.
Allende is the first Latin-American Marxist leader on the continent to
be democratically elected.

The election was necessary because no candidate had received a
majority in an mlier election. ‘

hat week, however, a young terrorist assassinated General Schneider,
the Commander-in-Chief of Chile's armed forces, to creat a crisis, in
which chaos would prevent Allende's ascension to the Presidency.
Because Chileans area politically tolerant and democratic people,
though, political order was maintained.

leaves many questions. Should a
new bridge be constructed? What
will the cost be? Where should it
be constructed?

A major proponent for the
building of a new bridge is Coach
R. Keith Munsey of the cross
county team. He says, “It was
used by everyone, not just by the
team. It was the talking point to
the whole luke.‘I

Munsey. who claims that the
bridge was the most. attractive
part of the cross-country course
(which includes the whole lnke
area), also said, “We need some
environmental beauty around
here-"something students can
use." He said this as he pointed to
the “tree-holders" in front of the
gym

Buckhoff also joins Munsey in
his desire for a new bridge. How-
ever, he says, “it is unreasonable
to think that it can be built now."

lllllllll.ll-ll-Ill--Ill-III‘III-I-ll-llllllll

Buckhoff doesn't think a bridge
will be built for another five
years. He explains, “A new bridge
is a kind of luxury item at this
point, until we have adequate
space for living and academics."

Buckhoff estimates that a bridge
would cost $50,000. This money,
as they money for lake construc-
tion, will most probably have to
come from the state. Money from
the state isn't simply allocated by
the legislature. First SUNY at
Albany, as Well as all of the other
State campuses must submit its
construction requests and the esti-
mated cost to the Central Housing
Office of SUNY. These requests,
if accepted, are presented to the
State Division of the Budget.

The $67,000 requested for lake
construction doesn't include up-
propriation for a new bridge, ac-
cording to Buckhoff. Therefore, a
request for funds for a new bridge
hasn‘t even been made out yet.
Buckhoff saw, "The $67,000 re-
quest was made before it was

known that the bridge would have
to be torn down."

Besides the state, there is
another possible place that money
for a new bridge could come
from. The Faculty-Student As-
sociation has a support item in its
budget which goes towards stu-
dent necds.The Budget committee
of the Board of Directors of FSA
allocates this money. Vice-Presi-
dent Clifton Thorne, who is a
member of the FSA Board of
Directors, suspects that this year's
money will go toward buying land
around Mohawk campus (which
could be used for student hous-
ing), putting in a ski tow at
Mohawk, and fixing up the M0-
huwk swimming pool. Thorne
isn‘t too hopeful about the chance
of FSA money being used for u
new bridge.

Because much of the area the
old bridge went over is now filled
in, Buckhoft' claims that a new
bridge would be built closer to the
center of the hike
Will the opinions of the entire
community, and not just the plan-
ners, be honored when future
campus construction and "clenrr
ing up" is done? Will the lake's
water he polluted to a point
where fish can no longer live in it?
The answers to these questions
must be answered by the entire
academic community. They
could mean the destruction or life
of the eumpus' only recreational
area, as well as destruetion of
much of the natural environment
on campus.

Dr. Stownrt said, “1 think it's
grout to plant, but for those areas
to become nuturnl will take be-
tween l()0 and 200 years.“ Per-
haps if we remember this we'll
stop replacing the natural with the
"stone" beauty.

Danes Gain Experience in Loss To Towson

by Dave Fink

“We left no regrets down
there" were the words of football
coach Bob Ford upon returning
from this past Saturday‘s game
with mighty Towson State of
Maryland.

The final score, 69-14 was an
indication, not of how poorly the
Danes played, but rather, of just
what stage we are at in our
football program.

For all intents and purposes,
the team just bit off more than it
could chew. Towson State is in its

fourth year of football. They play
a completely intercollegiate
schedule, competing lagainst such
fine teams as Randolph-Macon
College. The latter were good
enough to qualify fora bowl game
‘last year and took advantage of
the invitation by beating powerful
Bridgeport.

“The kids learned quite a bit
and grew quite a bit on Saturday"
commented Ford. He added that
the team really hustled and more
importantly, didn't quit in a game
where it would have been very
easy to do so. A good indication

League Playoffs Begin
TXO- ninth Floor,
STB-EEP Top Bill

With a 7-3 win over APA, S’I‘B
completed the League 1 football
schedule last Saturday.

League 11 and “I remain unset-
tled however, with the playoffs
cheduled to begin this week. In
League 11, TXO is matched against
the Ninth Floor, and the Hicks
battle the Huns, to set things up
for the championship Saturday.
The winners of the two semifinal
games will clash at 10 am.

League 111 features the Aces vs.
the Circus, while in the other
semifinal game EEP ill will try to
avenge their League 1 season with
STE 111. The finals will be held
next Saturday.

The STBvEEP encounter should
be one of the finest bullgumes all
year. STB, after defeating Potter
twice during the regular season,
was handily beaten in the third
game between the two teams,
13-0. STB will have its work cut
out for it today.

gular season are as follows:

,of the fact that the Danes hung in
there right up to the final gun was
the fact that, according to Ford,
at the beginning of the year,
players would come off the field
with minor injuries. Now, as
evidenced Saturday, they refused
to come off the field short of
having to be helped off. Co-
captain Royce Van Evra was
kicked in the head and shoulder.
He luckily wound up with no
concussion but his shoulder is
separated. He is a doubtful starter
for Saturday’s game with Marist.

iPooler was helped off the field ‘

when he received a gash below his
eye. Stitches were required to
close the wound.

Getting down to the game it-
self, it was a simple question of
Towson State being the vastly
better ball club. The Tiger‘s
quarterback, Al Dodds, 14th in
the nation in the decathlon last
year, picked apart the Dane secon-
dary. State began the game using a
four man rush but they quickly
found out that this was inade-
quate. There are two things that
can be done to solve this problem.
Either blitz the quarterback with
your linebackers and have the re-
maining men in the secondary
play man-to-man or continue
playing zone defense with one or
two less men back. Ford decided
to use the first alternative. Unfor-
tunately, not having used the
mun-to-mun setup too often pre-
viously, Albany was still futile in
its attempt to stop the passing
game.

With Towaon completing 16 of
18 tosses, this naturally comple-
mented and strengthened their
running game. The linebackers
and comet-backers, preoccupied
with stopping the pass, were un-
able to come up quickly to help
the defensive line stop the rush.

Offensively, the Danes fell be-
hind at the start thus putting a
great deal of pressure on the
offensive unit. They had to play
catch-up football which meant
that they had to go to the air,
something that they don’t like to
do. This was made even more
difficult due to the fact that the
Tiger’s defensive line was very big
and very tough and was able to
put a strong rush on State quarter-
backs Bill Flanagan and Gordie
Kupperstein.

Looking back on the game,
Coach Ford said that if we were in
our fourth year of football and we
lost by this score, he would be a
little bit more critical of the
team's effort. He was quick to
comment however, that the game
did show that the team must work
harder on technique-the basic
skills of blocking, tackling, shed-
ding block and passing. He added
that in a game, certain things are
under a coach’s and team's con-
trol. They cannot control the op-
ponents hard work, dedication,

enthusiasm or pride. They can,
however, control their own.

Looking ahead to Saturday's
encounter with Marist College, the
Couch concluded, "We will be
ready!"

Booters Lose
to Stony Brook

The Varsity soccer team con-
tinued to be plagued by u luck of
offensive punch Saturday, as they
lost their sixth consecutive game
of the season, 2—0, to Stony
Brook.

This loss run the team's record
to 2-7 for the season and did
nothing for the team's morale.
The home team was 6-0 going into
the game.

“We just can't get the ball into
the net," were the words of Coach
Bill Schieffelin. The Dunes were
outshot 25-10. This is an indica-
tion of the fact that State was not
missing the goal on their shots-
they just weren't getting them.
This is primarily the fault of the

lialfbucks who play in the middle ‘

of the field. Their job is to get the
bull to the forwards. When they
don't do this the forwards can't
shoot. Result-no goals. Schieffclin
said, “The hard part is setting up
the goals. Kicking the ball into the
net is easy,"

Stony Brook scored both its
markers in the first period. Their
initial goal came with seven min-
utes gone in the period when the
ball rolled between one if State's
fullbacks und goulic John Thuyer.
Both hesitated in going for the

ball and when John finally kicked
it, it hit a Colonial forward and
went into the goal.

The second score came ona
penalty kick. Fullback Nick
Ascienzo was called for trippingu
Stony Brook forward. Actually,
he skidded for the ball and
tripped the man unintentionally.
The rules state that if the defen-
sive man reaches the ball first, the
trip is not a penalty-this was the
case but the official called the
infraction anyway.

Later in the game, Dane half-
back Jeff O’Donneil took a free
kick that went into the Stony
Brook net but the goal was disal-
lowed because forward Fred
Campbell was offside.

ln summing up the game,
Schieffelin reiterated that a team
can't wait for its opponent to
make a mistake. They must go out
and create their own opportuni-
ties.

Wednesday, the Danes take on
powerful neighbor RPI, led by
All-star forward Casey Trappcn-
burg. HP! is taking the Danes
lightly as they are already looking
forward to their game Saturday
with Brockport. State will be try-
ing to pull off a big upset. Come
out and watch the game.
