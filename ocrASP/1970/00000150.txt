Davis And Brignola A Hit

by Bob Roseablum

It was about an hour late when
the concert was ready to begin
and the restless crowd was in no
mood to listen to some third rate
warm-up group. Nick Brignola’s
quartet took the stand for the
most part unknown and the audi-
ence grudgingly sat dowu tohear
what he had to offer. To their

Santana LosesSecond Time

by Eric Graeber

SANTANA is one of the groups
that burst into national promi-
nence after their performance at
the Woodstock Music and Art
Fair. They have recently released
their second album, ABRAXAS,
on the Colombia label.

Carlos Santana is basically a
very limited guitarist. and he is
not about to win any awards with
his voice.

SANTANA’s performance and
personality hinges on their drums,
bongos, and percussion and in this
realm they are top notch. Greg
Shrieve may be on his way to
replacing Ginger Baker as the
most exciting rock drummer.

There is a bit more versatility on
ABRAXAS than there was 0“

surprise it was an explosive set of
rock-jazz selections of the highest
order.

Brignola started out slowly with
a barely audible baritone solo, but
many appreciated the hard driving
beat of drummer Larry Jackson
and bassist Eddie Ananias. The
reedman moved to tenor and alto,

their first album, which was cen-
tered around three or four basic
chords. “Singing Winds. Crying
Beasts" is SANTANA in an entire-
ly different vein, and they should
be encouraged for trying‘ to rescue
themselves from their self-
imposed quicksand. This song
creates a good image of a
mythological sea voyage.
Saniana‘s guitar growls out ol' the
night like a sea monster while
Shrieve‘s cymbals sound like
wavcs crashing into the hull of the
ship.

"ch Como Va" is vintage SAN-
TANA as the group cffectivaly
mixes Carlos' grinding guitar licks
with Rollie‘s swirling organ solo.

Unfortunately, the other songs
on the album are (lull, repetitious,
and devoid of spirit. Carlos Sini-
tana's one attempt at country
blues is a complete dud. "Incident
at Ncshabur" fails to live up to its
interesting title as the group
doesn‘t seem to know in which
direction they want the song to
go, It has no main theme, no
substantch outline, a complaint
that could be made about most of
SANTANA'a instrumentals.

In sum, most of the flavor and
excitement that pervades a
SANTANA concert is somehow
lost on their album work.

JOE: A “Cut Reaction”

Deeply Moved Hippie

Hey, you gotta dig this flick
that's been playing in Albany for
the past couple of weeks; by the.
name of “Joe.” Well, it’s about
this hard-hat who teams up with a .

big company executive when they
discover they both feel the same
way about freaks. I mean, it
shows you what can happen if we
don’t stay hip to what's going on,
you know?

Concert This Friday

New music will be heard this
Friday night as the Creative Asso-
ciates of the Buffalo Center for
the Creative and Performing Arts
present a concert of live and
live-electronic music in the Main
Theater of the Performing Arts
Center.

Led by Lukas Foss, conductor
of the Buffalo Philharmonic and
head of the Center, the group
consists of young professional mu-
sicians and theater people who
perform new music, drama, and
mixed~media. Since 1968, Legnren

but it was not until he picked up
the flute that the people really
became attentive. He has mastered
the humming flute technique that
has been recently popularised by
Jethro Tull, in a song consisting of
short segments of stop time. From
then on he had all listeners eating
out of his hands. An encore was
demanded and given: an untempo
number with a slick running bass-
line.

Miles Davis was the main chnt
and he offered some interesting
music. He opened on trumpet and
the group played continuously
barely acknowledging applause,
Davis‘ playing has changed radical-
ly, borrowing from (of all people)
Don Ellis as well as Coltrane. l'lc
mixed screaming glissandos with
short one-note attacks as perfectly
timed as a boxer‘s punch. Who»
ever played on electric piano had
a lot of technique, and generally
used it to advantage. The rccd
man also played nicely il' often
uninmgimitively, and stuck pretty
much to a blues drenched con-
cept. He reminded me a lot of
ex-Gillespe-ite Leo Wright when
pining alto, both in tone and
conception. Jack dc Johnette pro-
vided all the spark that Davis
needed. HP has become one of the
most prufit'it'nl drummers In

Unfortunately the gym is not at
all suited to jazz. The scaling,
both on the bleachers or the floor,
was very uncomfortable and the
sound was treacherous. Don
York's piano was rarely more are
ticulatc llnm a constant shrink and
bass was often impcrccptablc lint
despite these inatlcquacxcs l.lll‘
audience gave the musicians a
generally good reception.

TOWN

chick-beautiful people—are try-
ing to hash out some sort of love
life in their place in the Village;
he’s trying to turn her on to what
he’s doing, namely dope, but: she's

I not quite free of her middle—class

suburbia-type hangvups. You
know? Anyway, she has a bad trip
and ends up in a hospital; her old
man (executiVe guy) flips out
when he sees her and goes to the
apartment in the Village, where he
bashes her boyfriend’s head in
because he can’t dig their relation-
ship.

Now, all that’s pretty straight,
happens a lot, I guess, but the
flick really gets heavy when the
old man meets Joe in a bar. In
between blacks, gay people, and
youth in general, Joe finds out
about the murder and who did it,
and becomes friends with the
executive. You can almost see a
common bond of hatred drawing
these two skunks closer together
as they rove around the city look-
ing for the guy's daughter (who
also figured out the murder, and
ran away). You know they're go-
ing to end up doing something
bloody; be sure to hang onto your
guts for the closing scene.

You can get twisted, though,
about what the flick is trying to
say, by listening to some of Joe's
outrageous lilies. I mean, they're
so outrageous they begin to be
funny at times, which is really bad
because you have to realize you‘re
watching a true thing, you know?
And you can get totally scrcwcd
up paying too much attention to
the two of them when they quiet-
ly complain about the lives they
live.

But dig the violence. Don't miss
it. Absolutely essential. Makes
you realize how the attitude of
most adults (which .vr all know
about, you know?) s threatening
the very cxislunre of sons and
daughtcrs and young people in
general. ’l‘hese cats are dangerous,

New Lots
Debated

by Steve Salant

David Nenfeld, President of Stu-
dent Association said Wednesday
that he would attempt to stop the
construction of proposed parking
lots “at all costs, even if we have
to obtain a court order."

He was reacting to the an-
nouncement of plans to begin, as
soon as possible, the construction
of parking lots between each
quadrangle and the proposed ex-
tension of the Academic Podium.

Neufeld termed the parking lot
plans “unacceptable under any
type of condition," and raised
numerous reasons for his objec-
tion to the lots.

He said that the proposed lots
would ruin the environment, “the
quality and nature of living,” and
that they would make it impos-
sible “to enjoy campus life with a
car rolling in at seven in the
morning underneath your win-
dow."

Neufcld also based his objec-
tions on the fact that students
were not involved in the formula-
tion of the plans for the construc-
tion sites.

He raised the question of wheth-
er students would be able to drive
up to their quads in order to drop
things off, after the new lots are
built.

Walter Tisdale, Assistant to the
President for Planning and Devel-
opment. reacted to Neufeld‘s an-
nouncement by saying that the
problems could be solved by com-
promise. He claimed thatstudents
constantly ask for more parking
space on campus while at the
same time wishing to preserve the
ecology and the landscape. Sacri-
l‘iccs would have to be made, he
said, to provide parking spaces
closer to the podium and to the
dorms.

’l‘isdalc said, also, that the plans

now approved fall under the Com-
prehensive Campus Plan, which
was really the product of the
Academic Plan, formulated in
ltltiii to anticipate the needs of
the University.

State University of New York at Albany

I Student Association President Neufeld charged that the lots would destroy the ecology of the area.

"Yes," he said, “there wasn't
any involvement, that l know of
by students" but remarked that
there was little desire evidenced
by students to participate at the
time.

He noted that the advantage of
closer parking is that there would
be has drop-off close to the
podium. He claimed too that etu-

up to their quads during certain
times when the gates are open.

Mr. 'l‘isdale said, too, that it has
not been decided whether the lots
will be for faculty or students or
both.

According to Mr. Tisilale, the
University has “signified concur-
renco" to the site development
plan—which means that the loca-
tion of the lots has already been
approved.

“For this particular plan, it is
past the point where (student)
involvement can be effective," Mr.
'I‘isdale noted.

He added, however. that “there
will soon be an upcoming point
for good involvement when the
next compromise campus plan is
presented for review" and said he
would cncourage student-faculty
involvement at that time.

containment policy is producing a
military domination of American
foreign policy, and earning for us
a world-wide charge that we are a
military, imperialistic nation."

Sponsored by SUNY’s Forum of
Politica, the former Senator from
Oregon delivered an address on
“Some Backstage History of the
US. Military Containment Pol-
icy,“ Tuesday night. Morse, who
considers himself a "consti-
tutional libcrnl," was one of the
first Senators to oppose the
United States' military inter-
vention in Southeast Asia. He was
a Senator for 24 years, and during
that time, served on the Armed
Services and Foreign Relations
Iommittees.

Senator Morse stated that our
involvement in this “illegal, imv
moral, bloody, costly, and unjusti-
fiable war" is a violation of the
United Nations Charter, the Con-
stitution, the Geneva Accords.
and “other tenets of international
law." He believes that we must
militarily withdraw from South
Vietnam and all of Asia, and "stay
out as far as military intervention
is concerned."

Morse feels that the United
States should call upon the United
Nations to take jurisdiction over
ending the war in South Vietnam
and abide by that jurisdiction. llc
declared that although the United
States set out alone as “policeman
to the world" to keep pcaca, it is
the U.N.'s job to keep the peace.
According to the former Senator,
rather than bringing peace to Vict-
nam, we have enlarged the war
and increased death and destrucv
tion.

Another major point Morse
made was that the government has
become one of “executivu au-
promacy and secrecy" and a
government by man rather than a
government by law. He said that
the American people anI entitled
to know the details of our foreign
policy and not be misled by
Nixon's "rhetoric." llu accused

v.

President Nixon of acting beyond
his constitutional power and
authority and without Con-
gressional authorization or know-
ledge when he ordered our troops
into Cambodia.

Senator Morse stated that unless
Nixon and his mliitary contain-
ment program are checked by
Congress, “disunity within our
country is bound to increase.“ It
is his belief that the growing
"political, economic, and consti—
tutional crises...will not abate un-
til Congress checks the spread of
American militarism. "

Morse concluded with his con-
viction tht the Nixon Doctrine is a

"cruel hoax," and is misleading
the American people into be—
licving that it offers a basis for
peace in Southeast Asia.

“The Nixon Doctrine will not
give us a generation of peace... it
will leave a heritage of war to
oncoming generations of young
Americans, unless we bring
under control, before it is too
late."

Oct. 31
Action

by Kenneth Deane

The Blst of this month marks
the culmination of the Fall Anti-
war Campaign. Rallies and
marches, in protest of the Viet-
nam War, are being planned in
thirty cities throughout the
United States in commemoration.

Protest activites on campus will
begin Saturday, with a march on
the capital from the downtown
campus. The march will assemble
at 1] a.m. at. Draper Hall and
proceed down Western Avenue to
the Capitol Building.

Speakers and entertainment are
scheduled following the march.
The speakers will include a
spokeswoman from the Women's
Liberation Movement, Liz Ewen,
who will speak on “The oppres-
sive role or the war in the Woman
Liberation Movement.” Several
student leaders and war veterans
along with Professor Trudeau, of
Nassau Community College, who
will speak on "Political repression
as a result of the war," are also
scheduled to address those
present.

A spokeswoman for the Capitol
Area Peace Action Coalition, co-
coordinators of the march with
the Student Mobilization Commit-
tee, stated the intended purpose
of the nation-wide demonstrations
to be “an effective and visible
means of showing the government
that a large segment of the Ameri-
can population want an im-
mediate withdrawal from South-
east Asia." it is also hoped that a
massive show of support will have
a positive influence in the election
of peace candidates.

Those wishing to serve as
marshals in Saturday's march or
to help in any further activities
should contact the Capitol Area
Peirce Action Coalition at. 727
