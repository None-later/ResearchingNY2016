Adams Hits Goldberg Argues Pririties

Overspending Says Rocky Buys Election

The campaign of Professor Paul
Adams has been based upon the
philosophy that government
serves its citizens best by govern-
ing less. He is an individualist who
believes that people can do more
for themselves.

“We need to restore the confi-
dence that people have in them-

Rockefeller Cites Record 513%."(uv macaw...“ 22,
Decrees Misrepresentation

Governor Nelson A. Rocke-
feller was interviewed in his New
York City executive headquarters
on September 9.

Governor Rockefeller is running
to vindicate his record of twelve
years, to re—establish himself as a
national ﬁgure and to be able to
continue his program of building
up New York State.

While Mr. Rockefeller has con-
ducted most of his campaign on
these themes, increasingly in the
last weeks he has turned to attack-
ing his river, Arthur Goldberg.

Mr. Rockefeller defends his rc-
cord by pointing to the extensive
netwmk of programs and agencies
and construction the state has
seen in rccant years.

His years of incumbcncy have
seen the state budget rise from 3
billion to $7‘/.i billion, the expan-
sion of the state university system
from 38,000 full-time students to
192,000, the creation of the
Urban Development Corporation,
massive construction particularly
in New York City, Albany and
Buffalo, the expansion of the
state’s welfare expenditures to the
point where they are the highest
in the nation.

He is making his appeal, how-
ever, not to the blacks and minori-
ty groups, nor to the liberals but
to the right wing and center eth-
nic groupings throughout the
state.

Thus, he is emphasizing llit
actions in the ﬁelds of law en-
forcement and drug addiction-

thc building of the State Police
Academy in Albany, the doubling
of the size of the State Police. the
creation of a Narcotics Enforce-
ment Agency, the compulsory
treatment of drug addicts.

While Mr. Goldberg has empha-
sized the mounting drug addic«
tion, and cited Rockefeller’s
acknowledgement that his drug!
programs had failed to stem the
tide, the Governor is challenging
Goldberg's statements as over-

- drawn and misrepresentative.

Mr. Rockefeller has had the
problem of being associated with
building programs with the con-
sequent image that he is insensi-
tive to people and their needs. He
vigorously denies this, stating as a
first prcmisc that buildings were
designed to meet popular needs.

“When I see buildings. l see
people inside them."

He is likewise emphasizing his
actions in the field of social wel-
fare: his increased aid to com-
munin health and retardation
ccntcrs now ten times as much as
in 1958 while the number of
patients served has risen from
30,000 to 170,000.11“: creation of
34 additional community health
boards.

He is likewrsc emphasizing
actions in the fields of pollution,
in particular the passage of the
1965 Pure Waters Program, and
the crea'ion of the nation‘s first
statewiuc Air Quality Standards
System to provide for air'
pollution monitoring, and the
zoning of hundreds of thousands
of acres for recreational and cul-
turalusc.

Government, he says, has only
shattered the individual‘s will and
ability to help himself. And on
this philosophy of government,
Adams separates himself from
Goldberg and Rockefeller.

Adams wants the state to spend
less and collect less taxes, and
therefore, leave more for the pri-
vate sector to handle. “We've al-
ways had the cry for a utopian
society: the idea that you know,
somebody's going to take care of
us froin cradle to grave." To Dr.
Adams, that‘s not Utopia.

Adams says, too, that the
Vietnam War issue is not relevant
to the gubernatorial race, and that
it can only "obscure" the cattl-
paing. l‘lc doubts, however, that
anyouc will call for the escalation
of the war.

Adams said that the war has
been a blind spot for students.
though, and tlial it has become a
“Pavlovian response" for the col-
lege students to defy the war.

lie claims that if elected hc
Would reorder the state's priori-

tics: “fiscal integrity and stability:
tax reform downward, the kind of
narcotics program that l have sug-
gested in terms of the position
paper which I released on this,
civil disorder, and pollution."

(Arthur Goldberg was inter-
viewed on October 16 at Albany
Airport during a press conference)

The principal theme of the
Goldberg campaign has been that
the priorities of the Governor's
Administration throughout the
twelve years have been “mis-
directed." Rockefeller. Goldberg
claims, has failed to exercise lea~
dership on the issues of Vietnem,
the plight of the poor, the Black
and the over-burdened middle«
class taxpayer.

Goldberg's style and philosophy
contrast with the Governor‘s.
While Mr. Rockefeller emphasizes
his material achievements, and
budgetary accomplishments,
Goldberg stresses his role as a
mediator of justice, equality and
economic ills. His role, as he sees
it, is to change priorities. To hold
the line on construction starts, to
raise welfare expenditures.

Thus. for example, Goldberg is
calling for a revitalization of mass
transportation in urban and subur-

ban areas. He claims that Rocke-
feller's priority for highway con-
struction is misdirected. Not only
do highWays serve the more all
lluent, but roads are increasingly
consuming the aspects of the en-
vironment as in the case of Bo'l.cn-
kill Valley (ASP, October 23.
1970).

Goldberg is also calling for an
increase in home rule for the
larger cities, especially New York,
and attacks the “beggar” role the
mayors must play before the
Albany Legislature each year for
funds. For instance, he points out,
the large cities should be allowed
to tax themselves.

Goldberg also favors laws
placing ceilings on campaign ex-
penditures to enable those with-
out wealth to run for office, as
well as the elimination of rest-
dency laws as requisites for vol-
ing.

Goldberg has likewise raised the
issue of tax reform. While Rocke-
fcllcr has levied a 5% sales tax.
Goldberg has called for amorc

Goodell Claims Integrity [it

Fights for Political Life

Charles Goodell has focused his
campaign on what he calls his
independence and integrity. He
has based his claim on his sharp
break with the Nixon Administra-
tion, which has moved to purge
him from the party and from the
Senate.

His conservative rival, Buckley,
claims to be the only Republican
in the race, while Ottingcr claims
to be the true liberal. Thus,
caught between the left and the
right, the Senator has stressed his
independence and his alienation
from the party regulars.

Gooodell has acknowledged that
he has changed his political philo-
sophy, but he adds, “I am proud
of it." He views his change as a
political metamorphosis which is
his reﬂection upon his educational
growth as a human being. At any
rate, he has compiled a liberal
record in the Senate.

His domestic voting record in-
cludes a vote against tax reform
for the strengthening of school
desegregation laws, an amendment
protecting the rights of defend-
ants, a motion to table the no-
knock provision, the reduction of
marijuana penalties, Child Nutri-
tion Law, against Carswell’s nomi-
nation, and voted against the DC.
crime bill.

in more detail, Goodell has
called for the guarantee ot'a mini-
mum of welfare benefits at $37001
for a fairiin of four.

The Senator has consistently
supported electoral reform (direct
election of the President), the
reformation 'of campaign spending
laws, and has been a strong sup-
porter of the 18-year-old vote.

Goodell has been a staunch dc-
fender of the “constitutional
rights of servicemen," as well as
the right of individuals to protest.
Concerning the timely issue of
civil liberties Goodell has also
fought for the right of privacy,
and against the “repressive” D.C.
Crime bill.

Charles Goodell has also been
fighting in the Senate for
Wome n's rights. He is a co~sponsor
for the women's equal rights
amendment. He also favors the
repeal of state abortion laws and
the creation of “locally controlled
day care centers."

On the economic issues, Goodell
said that our economic ills will
not end until the War ends. But he
denies the necessity for tax cuts,
because it will “feed inflation,"
against tax reform bill because it
did not reform the tax structure
but he did vote for the amend-
ments to cut the oil depletion
allowance.

And on Vietnam, which is his
most popular issue, he calls for a
volunteer army and the elimina-
tion of student dcferments. He
said “No US. interest in Vietnam
justified the sacriﬁce of so many
American lives."

Stresses Liberal Record

Ottingcr is running on the pre-
mise that he is the only consistent
liberal in the three-way Senatorial
race. He bases his claim on his
six-year record in the House and
on his programs for the future.

When Ottingcr was sworn in as a
representative, he said of the war,
“it is the wrong War in the wrong
place for the wrong cause." Ac-
cording to the New York Times,
(Oct. 25, 1970) the White House
cracked down on the freshman
congressman, telling him he “had
better stick to Conservation and
leave Southeast Asia to President
Johnson."

According to the ratings given
by the Americans for Democratic
Action, Ottingcr's domestic policy
has been consistently liberal. Ot-
tingcr voted for the reduction of
interest rates, voted for the Phila-
delphia Civil Rights Plan, family
assistancc, against the ABM and
for unemployment compensation
for farm Workers during the past
two years. He also voted against
the Resurrection (‘itics Bill which
prohibited camping or sit-ins on
public property in Washington
D.('.. against the income tax sur-
chargc. and against Nixon's
“watered-down" Voting Rights
Act.

ADA gave Ottingcr a 100% libe-
ral quotient in January, 1970 and
endorsed his bid for the Senate.

Ottingcr claims to have been
prominent in the fight for the
environment. As a freshman con-
gressman in 1966, be sponsored
the Hudson River Compact. He
helped bring to suit the fight
against Con Edison‘s King Moun-
tain plant

Ottingcr has been a critic of

national transportation priorities
“which see more than 60 times as
much spent on highways than on
mass transit. He has sponsored
hills creating a $10 billion mass
trasit fund."

The Democratic Congressman
has likewise criticized Nixon for
“a disastrous depression in the
housing industry," and has called
for the building of low to middle
income dwellings in the nation’s
urban areas.

On the national issue of crime
and disorder, Ottingcr has op-
posed the preventive detention
bill (supported by his two op-
ponents) and thc “no-knock"
crime hill.

On the Middle liast,Otlingcr has
been an outspoken supporter of

“I intend in this campaign to
speak to and speak for the mil-
lions of New Yorkers who will not
stand by while the Wreckers go to
work,“ proclaims James Buckley,

Conservativevlndependent candi-
date for the Senate.

Included in the “millions” are
the majority of black New
Yorkers “who repudiate the fana-
tic hatred preached by a militant
few,‘ the majority of students
“who attend their colleges and
universities, who have a serious
purpose of securing an education
and who bitterly resent having
that education interrupted by the
strong arm tactics of a few," and
the “rank and file of American
labor, which marched on Wall
Street 150,000 strong to demon-

trate their love of country.”

Buckley backers claim a strong
rapport with the “silent majori-
ty." These voters, they feel, are
fed up with crime, campus vio-
lence and antiwar protests and
tend to blame “liberal” politicians
for fanning unrest.

The Conservative candidate sup-
ports President Nixon‘s war policy
and argues that the US. will not
he a credible fort“ in the Middle
East if it does nu i..lVC credibility
in Southeast Asia. “We are not
going to allow the balance of
power to be tipped,“ he says.

Buckley's views on other topics
follow:

StudentsiCollegcs and univer-
silics have become sanctuaries for

campus toughs who terrorize
faculty and other students. He
criticizes school administrators

who “fail to talk back [to radi-
cals] and who concede that they
have an argument when they have
not."

Drugs” “A separate court system
should be established to provide
separate treatment for addicts."
There is a need for a “strict
crackdown on the importers and
wholesalers of drugs."

The Draft poses an “agonizing
dilemma to the nation's youth. By
eliminating conscription we would
simultaneously improve the ef-
fectiveness of our military and
