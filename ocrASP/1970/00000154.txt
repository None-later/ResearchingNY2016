Walinsky ‘educotes ’ Public '

Says Lefkowitz Negligent;

(Adam Walinsky woe inter-l

viewed in hit campaign head-
quarters in New York City on
Sept. 23.)

Adam Walinsky’s campaign has
as its accentuation an emphasis on
an agressive law enforcement
agency and an emphasis on youth.

Claiming that the Attorney
General should be "the people’s
ﬁrst lawyer" and a regulating
force on the state goVernment
itself, Walinsky has charged that
Mr. Lefkowitz has been grossly
negligent in his duties to prose—
cute both state and industry for

racial, pollution, narcotics and big .

time crime violations.
“The main issue in this cam-

paign is the fact that the attorney ‘

general is not using his powers to
protect the people of the slate of
New York."

In the ﬁeld of pollution, Walin-
sky charged that the state did
nothing in the face of 58 deaths
which he claims were due to
unhealthy conditions in factories.

He also charged that the Attor-
ney General‘s ofﬁce has not on-
forced the Pure Air and Waters
Act passed in I965. and has cited
numerous violators who have not
been prosecuted:

Mohawk Paper Mill in
Cohocs for polluting the
Hudson

.lJ. Rogers in Blackbrook
for polluting Lake Cham-
plain

Georgia Paciﬁc in Platts-
burgh

Walinsky was one of the co-

 
   
 

founders of the New Democratic
Coalition and has been a strong
supporter of the Stein Bill which
would attempt to protect New
Yorkers from ﬁghting in the Viet-
nam War. Under the Stein Bill, the
Attorney General would be in
charge of presenting the case be-
fore the courts. “How would
Lefkowitz handle it?“ he asked.

Walinsky is urging an all out
campaign to stop the trade in hard
drugs, but has stated that posses-
sion of marijuana should not be a
crime. He is against its legaliza-
tion, hOWever, “because i don’t
want American tobacco spending
a million dollars to push it, which
I have no doubt they would do."

Walinsky, a former legislative
assistant to Robert Kennedy, re-
leased a report in l968 citing
widespread racism in the construc-
tion industry. Asked if any pro-
gress has been made since the
release of that report. he said,
“Nothing significant. The prac-
tices continue as they did with a
few Iokcn cases to pretend that
something‘s been done."

This statement probably encom-
passes much of the spirit of his
campaign: that the state has done
little or nothing to meet the crisis
in American society and that the
state's chief law enforcement of-
ficer has not exercised his power
to move against industry and the
slate itself in thier failure to meet
social needs.

“i supposed you‘d call it public
education. i go to considerable
pains to tell [people] that we
can‘t have law enforcement for
Ithem] and not for blacks and
people being crushed."

Lefkowitz
Cites Actions

(Mr. Lefkowitz was interviewed
at a Samtogu appearance on Oct.
16.)

Louis Lefkowitz has been at-
tacked by Adam Walinsky for his
failure to prosecute violations in
industry hiring practices and pol-
lution. He reacts strongly to these
charges and calls them .“irres-
ponsible."

Lefkowitz claims to have been
active in both fields. He cited the
following cases in which fines
have been collected:

Roberts Brothers—$ 100

Mecca Brothers—$75

Taylor Line—$500

Chandler—$650 (forcing them
out of business)

Peter Cooper—$600

Mobil Oil Corp: $l0.000

He claims. moreover. that his
office has no control over the
granting or withholding of re-
batcsi the returning of the fines
and that Walinsky's charge that
most of the lines have been rebat-
cd is irrelevant.

Lefkowitz, as Well. claims that
his office is limited that it can
prosecute only matters which are
referred to it by the state commis-
sions. Thus. for instance. he ans-
wers Walinsky‘s charge that the
death of 58 workers due to health
violations went unprosecutcd.
with the replay that the industrial
Commission did not believe there
was sufficient evidence to bring
suit and therefore did not refer
the matter to the Attorney Gen-
eral's office.

Lefkowitz has also made pro-
posals to clear the backlog in the
courts. calling for the establish-
ment of a Special Court for Nar-
cotics Cases. the transference of
all civil judges to the criminal
part, the working of extra hours
by those judges. and the use of
volunteer lawyers to serve in hear-
ing misdemeanors.

He has likewise called for the
creation of a consumers‘ division
within the Attorney General's of-
fice.

Lclkowitl. ha». proposed a "(‘on-
sumer's liill of Rights" which
would consist of thirteen laws.
which are intended to protect the
consumer.

progressive income tax, the idea
of which would be to force the
wealthy to pay more.

Goldberg has charged that Rock-
efeller is a rubber-stamp for the
Nixon administration on the
national issues of Vietnam and the
economy. The democrat favors a
more hasty withdrawal from
Southeast Asia. On the economy.

hard on the Governor‘s advertising

stand the naturc of Communist
agression, they are associating
themselves with forces that would
leave the US. without the means
of defending our commitments.

Buckley is obviously pinning
much of his hope on the fact that
Goodcll and Ottinger will split the
anti-Nixon vote between them
leaving him the ‘modcralcs“ and
“conservatives.”

Gridders Must Dent Marist Defense To Win

The State football team begins
the second half of its initial season
this Saturday when the club
travels to Poughkeepsie to play
powerful Marist College.

The home team is. indeed, a
formidable opponent as their un-
blemished 5-0 record indicates.
They are rated second in the State
among clubs and small colleges
and are, more impressively,
ranked eighth in the nation among
club teams.

The Vikings boast. a very fine
defensive unit that has not given
up a point. in 17 consecutive

quarters up until last Saturday's
game against Catholic University.
Then defense just fell apart, how-
ever. as they gave up six points,
one whole touchdown. The unit is
led by two exceptional inside line-
backers, 6‘0", 200 lb. Hank Blum
and 6'0", 185 lb. Dean Gestnl.
State Coach Bob Ford says. “they
are an outstanding defensive foot-
ball team."

Marist‘s offense can brag a little
bit also. They have scored 120
points thus far in five games, on
average of twenty four points per
contest.

 

Football:WhatItIs

 

 

 

 

by Dave Fink

The person most. directly affected by this new awareness of football
and its relationship to our existence is the coach. He is the one who

must cope with it. try to under
attempt to alter his methods to deal
Albany coach. Dr. Robert Ford h

stand it and, most importantly.
with it.
as taken this stop. He realizes that

to run a football program he must not live in the past. He is aware of
the feelings of today's student and he has endeavored to treat his
players with the respect with which he would have them treat him.

There is a basic assumption that one must make about football,
Because it is a team game as opposed to a sport which is characterized
by individual effort. there must. be a certain degree of discipline
present. A player has a responsibility. not only to himself. but to ten
other men. Thus he must not only adhere to the coaches’ rules but he
must. learn to regulate his own actions Dr, Ford does not believe in
rules for the sake of rules. Hc docs not care about thr.l length of a
man's hair unless it gets to the pointwhere he cannot sec because of it.
Sometimes. a man with too much hair is exposed to head injury
because his helmet will not fit securely. Then he must have it cut. Ho
cares little about how a player dresses because it does not. affect his
play. He will not. tell his players what. hour to be in bed. nor will he
tell them not. to drink or not. to smoke. He will tell them how both
can hinder their effort and then leave it up to their personal
discretion. He understands that football is not for everyone. that there
are those who cannot subject themselves to any degree of discipline.
He also realich that for those who do want. to play ball. he must not
make it distasteful for them.

Football, to Dr. Ford. is the essence of democracy. While he realizes
that. there is no room for it in the huddlc. he makes a practin of it in
administering to the team. The quarterback is the boss in the huddle.
There is no time. nor is it expedient to take a vote on the play to run.
But on the field. as a whole. the team of 60 men is a microcosm ofth
outside world. “TheI squad is comprised of Jews. Catholics. Protes-
tants. Blncks. whites. Orientals. rich men and poor men. 0n the
football field. they all havo the same opportunity. lt's unfortunate
that this is not thtI case off the field." stated Ford,

Finally. we have all bcen told that a sport such as football builds
character. When asked what this meant. Dr. Ford said this: “Some-
time in every man‘s life. he will probably be confronted with at least
one of four had (lisnppointmunts- l ) he will he very serious with a girl
and then break off with her. '2) llt‘ will not get something that he
really wants. ll) be will lose a wife or a child or. -l) he will lose a job.
He must learn to get up and fight back to reestablish his being.
Football has a great potential for disappointment. At the same timc. it
has a potential to afford a man the opportunity tourndicntctllttl
disappointment.“ indeed. football can be a tremendous learning
experience. in short. to tho squeamish. to lln- nonviolent. ll has no
worthwhile value. Yet. to others. it presents an opportunity to work
hard at achieving a goal. in unison with others. where every rnnn is a
separate and equal entity. whore llt' can lt'ut'll how to win anti most
important. where he can lcnrn how to lose.

 

There Will be a Volleyball Cup»
lnins' meeting on 'l‘ltursdny. Nov.
bill at if :00 pm. in l’E 1‘25.

The Vikings possess two very
good running backs in Dick Has-
brouck and Murry Millignn who
go 6'0" 200 lbs. and 5‘10“ 185
lbs. respectively. Hasbrouck is a
very strong inside runner while
the latter possesses great speed
and must be respected outside.
Jim Wilkens is their quarterback
and. while he is not a great passer.
he is a very fine leader and calls a
very intelligent ballgnme. The of-
fensive line will be difficult to
handle as they are very big with
every man being 210 lbs. or over.

Probably the most dangerous
man on the field for Marist will be
flanker Charlie Browne. He is 6‘l “
and 215 lbs. of muscle with great
quickness and good hands.

Coach Ford added. that. while
the Vikings are a very good foot.-

defensively. anytime a beam can-

Marist is very productive on the
rush both inside and outside, the

They do not. however. pass well.
Granted. the Danes pass defense
