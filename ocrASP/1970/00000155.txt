Can Parietal Rights Bring Happiness?

The second most serious problem currently facing our troubleil
campuses is the problem of parietal rights. (The first most serious
problem of course is the recent outbreak of moiilt among sorority
house canaries.)

Let us today look for answers to the parietal rights problem, for
that is the purpose of these columns: to analyze the dilemmas that vex
our colleges, to seek feasible solutions. I write them for the brewers of
Miller High Life Beer. In return they piiy me money. That is the
American way. It has made this country great.

But I digress. A parietal right, as you know of course, is the right
of a student to keep a parietal in his room. A parietal, as you know of
course, is a small North American miirsupiiil somewhat like a chip-
munk in appearance but iictually a species of fur-bearing herring
(mulaliii niularrdi‘s).

Naturally you all want to keep a parietal in your room. Not only
are they endlessly cheerful —always romping and frisking aan wagging
their little binaries—but they're smart too. They're not as smart as
dogs of course, but they ciin readin learn simple tricks like fetching
your slippers or parsing a sentence.

But the main reason you want a parietal is because they eat noth-
ing but beer cans. I promise you, friends, you get yourself a healthy
adult parietal and you'll never agiiin have to lug empties to the trash
barrel. And of course the better the beer can, the more he‘ll eat, which
of course accounts for the popularity of Miller High Life on every
campus. Obviously a beer as good as Miller is bound to come in a can
of the same superb quality. And that's what Miller hils—ﬂlllperl) qual-
ity. Also malt and hops and water and a marvelous brewing formula
that's been kept secret for generations. In fact, this formula is so secret
that it's known only to the chief brewmastL-r and he is never allowed
to leave the brewery. So if you ever fian yourself in Milwaukee, look
up his wife.

But I digress. A healthy adult parietal, I was saying, will eat his
weight in Miller beer cans every day. However, if yoti drink your
Miller in bottles— as millions do, and no wonder, for who is not tempted
by such sparkling amber goodness in such crystal-clear hottlcs‘.’ Eh?
Who Is notl—if, I say, you drink your Miller in bottles, I have to tell
you that parietals won‘t help. They don't eat bottles. In fact, the only
pet that does is the scaly bursar (/riirornrix nruyrrsus), but take my
advice: don't get one. The sciin hursar iit best is a beast of sluggish
demeanor and uncertain temperament. Oh, sure, sometimes it will play
a little Monopoly when it's in the mood, but mostly it just lays around
grooming its addenda. Moreover, it‘s given to sudden fits of pique iind
may tank you without warning.

But I digress. Why, you ask. won't the (lean let you keep a parie—
tal In your room? I'll tell you why: the parietal, a nocturnal animal,
sleeps only by day. At night it is always awake and~hore's the rub—
during its waking hours it utters a loud, guttiiral croak approximately
once every 2%, seconds, a sound something like: "l’rock . . . I’roclr . . .
Prock."

   

ﬂ  .l g . _ ' \

Well, naturally when "Frock . . Prock . . . Frock" starts booming
down the corridors. every proctor in the dormitory leaps out of bed
and comes running. Last year alone more than 30,000 of them were
killed tripping on their nlghtshirts. I

And so, dear friends, you see that the dean iloui have ii point.
Won't you put down your grenade and have a meaningful dialogue
with him? Sweet reason can still save your college. Don't let it go tilt!
way of so many others-7 abandoned hulkii today, stark and silent ex-
cept. for ghostly sounds echoing In the night: “I’roclt . . . l’rock . . .
Frock." ” * n

FRIDAY. OCTOBER 30. 1970 IALBANY STUDENT PRESS

VIET ROCK, Experimental Theatre's newest pro-

duction, is a series of actor improvisations assem-

bled by Megan Terry, the Yale dramatist. Conceived

in 1966, it was considered at the time to be a radical

oAtlitcry against government policy in South East
is.

Today, in our post-Chicago/Cambia/Kent world,
VIET ROCK scents of tamer stuff; nevertheless, its
point, that American society inherently destroys
individuals (in this case through the military) is still
applicable. That alone insured the giant turn-out
VIET ROCK enjoyed. In terms of attendance, it is
probably one of the more successful shows per-
formed at this University.

VIET ROCK insists on setting us against Vietnam
on purely emotional grounds. Throughout, Megan
I‘erry develops situations destined to pull the strings
from under our hearts. Lachrymosety is law;
banished is the brain. This painful alliteration brings
to mind another master of rhetoric, Spiro Agnew.
He too can make speeches which deny reason. He
too can make America shed tears. Only when
Agnew speaks, he is for the war, and on prime-time

To combat Agnew, or any hawk, VIET ROCK
should have used the arsenal of logic: one water-

. tight argument is worth fifty buckets of bathos. It is
infinitely superior, and ultimately more viable, to
demonstrate the idiocy of a garbage Administration
by putting its policies under rigid scruntiny, rather
than wallow in self-pity. That has never changed .
anything.

 

 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Politics aside, Doug Wager did a worthwhile

directing job. Perhaps the cast was not brillian
‘ individually; yet it succeeded in working togethe
like a perfectly oiled, superbly designed machine.
Wager turned a potential handicin (absence of a1
"star") into an advantage. All helped cqually create
VIET ROCK.
Though no one actor outshone the rest, there were
:severiil particularly good performances. As the
sergeant, Greg Haymes, previously noted in
FEIFF‘EROLOGY, carried a heavy load on his back.
One slip and VIET ROCK would have crumbled.
Others, like Margaret Dwyer, Jeff 'I‘inklman, and
Peter Salm, realized their little skits perfectly.

On the other hand, Wager did not cut, or edit
neveral scenes which stiink of kitsch. For example:
the mother/dead son episode, featuring Leslie
Bergson. It belonged to a soap opera; one could‘
almost hear the violins in the background. It is a
director's job to realize that improvisations can
lapse into liistrionics, and that judicious editing is
almost a requirement. VIET ROCK was no ex-
caption.

But what Wager did with lights made up for it. He
used all the equipment at his disposal with intel-
Mligence and feeling. Moreover, he moved the cast
around the stage nicely. The combination of the lwo
produced some interesting visual experiences.

I

VIET ROCK then was a pleasant surprise to what
we have witnessed so far. It Wits a tangible proof
that the Theatre Department can come through
with a good piece of thciitrc. We eagerly iiwait
further efforts.
