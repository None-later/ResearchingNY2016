claring that in light of the com-
mittee recommendations, further
budgetary allocations could only
serve to help improve the station
and aid the student body, not
cause greater financial error.

The heart of the question, ac-
cording to Clingan and Lenny
Kopp, was the issue of whether
Council has the right to meddle
into the inner workings of the
various student activities. High-
lighted at several points in the
discussion was the fact that Coun-
cil members did not really under-
stand how a radio station works.
Station representatives also bitter-
ly denounced those opposing
them who had never seen the
station.

Lenny Koppt added amore
down-to-earth touch in this argu-
ment by stating that the signal
received on Dutch Quad this year
was presently very clear, a huge
improvement over last year's stat-
ic. With this particular tangible
evidence of improvement, station
management must be working
toward the betterment of WSUA
on campus.

Wasserman stuck by his original
statement that the top eight of-
ﬁcials of the station should resign
to allow for more ‘trustwarthy‘
management. Asserting that he,
too, would like to see a better
radio station and would even vote
for further appropriations, the
present management of WSUA
would make this an elusive goal.

Dick Wesley supported the
management by stressing their
personal dedication in coverage of
events at their own expense. Sta-
tion Manager Keith Mann, person-
ally attacked in comments by
several Council members, had ta-
ken command of the station in a
"time of crisis," said Wesley, and
his action(iis well as those of the
rest of the station management)

    

Will the next US. Senator from New York, whoever he may be, be
able to solve the hurd ensome problems which Americ‘a faces today?

The peculiarity of the vote
caused several Council members
to question its validity. Since
some question remained over the
legality of the second vote, many
people, both on Council and from
WSUA, seemed interested in the
possible recourse of the station
towards reconsideration of this
decision.

for one hour every week to talk:
sometimes to discuss and practice
difficulties with certain words,
sometimes to discuss something

According to a New York Times surVey. the composrtion of the
92nd Congress which convenes next January. will closely resemble
the present Congress. The Democrats are generally expected to gain
from 5 to 15 seats.

President Nixon has called for an end to the "appeasement" of the
“thugs and hoodlums" who have been rampaging the nation,
according to the President. His remarks were directed to the recent
incident in which his car was the victim of eggs and stones.

Senator George McGovern, in Halloween humor, accused Nixon or
using fear tactics during the campaign. “The goblins (evildoers of
America) will get you if you don‘t follow us (the Republicans)," the
Senator said in a most derisive tone.

Black voters are being ignored this year, even by white liberal allies,
said a New York Times report. The report attributed the failure of
Blacks to find politically reeptive candidates to the shift to the right
in this country.

In the closing days of the campaign, Arthur Goldberg told Long

campaigned with him on Long island, was his source of wealth.

Rockefeller campaigned for Charles Goodell yesterday, in what is
termed the greatest support the Governor has given the Senator during
the entire campaign.

Richard Ottinger charged both President Nixon and James Buckley,
his Conservative rival, with stirring up popular emotions on the issue
of violence. The Democrat called their tactics “unconscionable.”

Campaigning with James Buckley in Westchester were Mario

Cushin vs. Wallace:

Black is Underdog

by J.W.Mondesiro
College Press Service

(CP S)—Thc fall election in Ala-
bama will introduce a new but
firmly organized and independent
political party into the electoral
arena. The National Democratic
Party of Albama (NDPA ), the first
Black statewide political party in
America, is waging u political cam»
paign of over one hundred seventy
candidates. These candidates span
the entire spectrum from governor
to co url surrogate.

The NDPA slate is headed by
Dr. John 1.. Cnshin, gubernatorial
candidate and Issaih Hayes. candiv
date for Lieutenant Go vernor.
’l‘hc NDPA was officially iii-
:iiigurutcd in 1068 when it. clini-
lcngcd the established machine at
I.llt' Chicago convention. it has
been continually expanding its
ranks from that initiation until it
was able to realistically challenge
thc strong political organization
that supports (icorgc Wallace.

Dr. Chasin is presently a practi-
cing dentist willi il very respected
practice covering a large number
of citizens throughout the state.
But he has continually sacrificed

his practice in order to coordiante
his political and civil rights activi-
ties.

In addition to the large nu mber
of candidates under the NDPA
banner is the far-reaching nature
of their platform. Several of the
provisions include:

*Rcstructuring the tax system
to remove the heavy burden from
the workers and poor, and insure
that the wealthy pay their share
of taxes;

vGuarantceing the rights of col-
lective bargaining for all workers;

-Abolishing the Wallace-Carter
Act and all other special privileges

which the state grants to big
business.
NDPA candidates state that

their platform is attempting to
create an alternative political
structure for the state ol'Alabamii
with the expressed goal of
wresting control of the state from
“the hands of cynical, exploitch
men like this Would-be ‘Gcorgc
the l“irst' and rctilrniiig it to the
men and women of every politi-
cal, racial, and economic back-
ground who believc in Alabama

The investigation which was in-
stigated by our opponean and
which was accepted by Council,
16-1-5, is now being ignored by
them. The report basically said
there was nothing wrong with the
management nor the operation. In

 
     

fact, it commended both. The
report claimed that:
l"i‘he summer misspending

aids the University Community
more than it helps the station
members. Money was never
spent on private matters. S.A.
money was not. wustcd. In the
end, the station took the most
obvious course, it did what
Council would probably have
done had it been around. Stud-
ent Association government
didn’t make the decision"
WSUA did. Therein lies the
true violation. It. is to prohibit
a recurrence, rather than to
take revenge, that is needed."

The recommendations that were
stipulated in the report have all
been implemented—yet, it ap-
pears, Council is insistant in tak-
ing revenge. Not a very noble and
conscientious attitude.

WSUA has lasted through this
and has grown stronger. We're not
concerned with mud-slinging or
politics. We want to get on with
the business of running ii radio
station for the student body.

‘Troubled Girls’ Aided
With Abortion Service

by Stephanie Dikovics

The Upstate Abortion Referral
Service is an tangwerihl service
available to those who dial
869-7777. In existence for one
month, the Upstate Abortion Res
ferral’s purpose is to advise preg-
nant women on abortion mea-
sures, and to recommend clinics
(usually in the New York City
vicinity) affiliated with the Ser-
vice, where ubortions are legally
performed.

in the Albany area, abortions
are relatively more expensive than
in N.Y.C., and to obtain an
abortion at Albany Medical Cen-
ter anyone under 21 years of age
must have parental consent. This
requirement for the abortion in
the Albany area has made many
girls turn to the Referral Service
for help. Because New York City
only requires'that those under 18
years need parental consent, and

because there is no residence re-
quirement, the Upstate Abortion
Referral Service recommends
most of their cases to the afﬁliat-
ed City clinics.

To obtain information, it is
necessary only to dial the number;
the caller leaves a name and
a Phone number with the answer-
ing service, and is then called back
by a member of the Upstate Abor-
tion Referral Service. No informa-
tion other than that pertinent to
the abortion is asked of the caller.
Usually the Service receives ten or
more calls a day, from girls with
an average age of 18-20 years.
Most cases are referred to the
NYC. clinics to obtain the 15-
minute long abortion operation,
where they are strictly on an
out-patient basis.

The service was termed by one
member of the Agency as an
“outlet for troubled girls." She
felt “it’s a pity it hasn’t reached
girls beforehand."
