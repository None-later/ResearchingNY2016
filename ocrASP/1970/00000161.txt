‘Dear Hippie...9

A reply to the Oct. 27th review
of JOE by "Deeply Moved
Hippie”...

by J. LaBnrbera

Deeply moved, ugh, whoever
wrote the reaction to “Joe”
printed in the October 27th issue
of the ASP should be tried for
assault and possession of a deadly
weapon, his biased mind. What
this alleged reviewer did was to
destroy a good movie by judging
it in terms of what he wanted to
see instead of what he saw. The
movie did not just put down adult
attitudes—it clcurly represented
the screwed-up attitudes of youth
and itgc.

Here is it quote from our (Iccply
moved hippie: “Opening Scene" a
guy and his chick“ beautiful
pcoplL--urc trying to bash out
some sort of love life... "

Beautiful people? Bullshit! Lcl's
analyze these beautiful pcuplr-
and their reluliwls'lii). starting
withth young guy.

Dcur hippie, have you over bccn
burnt buying drugs? Would you
call the guy who burnt you a
bcuutiful person? You did in your
article. I assume you saw the
movie in which cusc you would
have seen your beautiful person
burning kids to get his own dope.
The guy didn’t give n shit about
anything but his drugs, including
the girl. In the opening scene he
ignores his lover's advances and
shoots up.

Deur hippie, how do you think
the girl felt then-beautiful? The
relationship was founded on drugs
and thrived only when there was
enough dope at hand, not LOVE.
That was one of the points the
movie got across which you forgot
to mention or didn't notice.
(Shades of Spiro). Yeah, sure, the
parents were screwed up lllld they
screwed up their daughter, but
didn't the cat who she loved put
her in the hospital with an OD.

(very beautiful)?

The movie goofcd on both
young and old sharply and
violently. I think you tried to
explain how the parents and Joe
were messed up but you got lost
in loose and vague expressions
such as suburbia-type, you know
(if you didn't know how could
anyone else), cxccutivc guy and
lust but not (cast, “dangerous
Cats."

It's pcoplc like Spiro, and Big

Derek and Dominoes - Clapton
Concert Falls Into Place

by Michele Pnlella

The expectation of a fantastic
concert drew an enormous crowd
to the SUNY gym on Friday
night. Eric Clapton was the "Pied
Piper” who called the audience
together.

Toant “in U",
and holding the audience's atten-
tion for a while. However, the

ZONE

people wanted Clapton and let it
be known. As Too Fat sang the
phrase, “I want some changes
made" the response was one of
applause. (It seemed that Toe Fat
was unwelcome at that point.)

Too Fat' accomplished its pur-
pose ns far as warming up the

This Saturday

ZONE: ON TOUR will be pre-
sented on November 7, I970 on
the Main Stage of the Performing
Arts Center. The multi-mcdiu pro-
duction is jointly sponsored by
Theatre Council, Music Council
and Art Council. The company
will also be in residence on cam-
pus November 6-8 presenting
demonstrations and workshops in
the afternoons.

ZONE: ON TOUR, a new media
theatre production directed by
Harris Barron, Alan Finneran, and
Ros Barron, is a company of
thirteen performer-technicians
who combine their varied talents
in the fields of painting, sculpture,
film, electronics, dance, theatre
and music to provide a kind of
visuul-cerebral ritual chorus.

This statement by the ZONE
directors reflects some attitudes

about their work: the sense that
life is mystery, forever elusive to
the exclusively rational, is the
impetus to a celebration of events
of visual emotional content which
have the very purticulnrized order
of dreams and the subjective
clarity of madness. [n the super-
life of contemporary reality, in-
tensity is frequently chaos. To
define an intensity of meaning
involves a presentation of highly
specific images in various synchro-
nized simultaneitics. The live
action. multiple film and slide
images, cubalistic sound, and elec-
tronic sets combine in a kinetic
ritual tableau to provide more
than sensory involvement.

Tickets are available at the
SUNYA Performing Arts Center
Box Office. For further informa-
tion and reservations, call

group, consisting of a drummer,
two guitarists and a lead singer
who was a good mlmic of’ Mick
Jagger, was not bad, but it could
not. approach the quality of Clap-
ton.

Their last song ended with a
good guitar solo which the.

" n. ’ ‘ " As Toe Fat
closed they received a good re-
action. (Is this because they were
finally through?)

What can'be said about Eric
Clapton? He came on like an
explosion and kept the'p'owe'r
going all through his performance.
His back-up group , Derek and the
Dominoes. was extremely good.
The group was only three pieces,
an organ, a guitar, and drums, but
together with Clapton formed an
unbeatable combination.

Clapton‘s music is innovative
and exciting. He’s a true artist in
every sense of the word. His per-
formance was flawless, and a
stimulating experience for the
audience.

After every number, Clapton
receiVed thunderous applause.
During the last song, the drummer
beat out a fantastic solo and
received a standing ovation. The
audience remained standing long
after the song's finish.

Eric Clapton had played for two
hours, and no amount of applause
and yells could bring him back for
an encore. This was the only
disappointment of the entire eVe-
ning.

One additional word of praise
should be given. The technical
crews, especially lighting, did a
tremendous job in contributing to
the total effect of the concert.
