sssssss

With the success of its best-
-scliing "Surrealiatic Pillow",
Jefferson Airplane emerged as the
nation's most exciting contem-
porary musical group.

Composed of lead singers Marty
Hahn and Grace Slick, lead guitar-
ist Jorma Kaukonen, bans guitarist
Jack Casady, drummer Spencer
Dryden, and Paul Kantner, singer
and guitarist, Jefferson Airplane
has created it sound drawn from
the jazz, folk, blues and rock ‘n‘

   

roll backgrounds of its individual
members.

Very much the voice of today’s
"happening" generation, the Air-
plane has it's roots in the much
talked about San Francisco scene.
The first Bay Area group to gain a
strong national following, Jeffer-
son Airplane does not sing songs
of protest, but rather of love.

In his song "Fat Angel,” folk
singer Donovan, refers to the
group by name, describing it as

Dear Miss Boyd:

I Will try to reply to your letter
as clearly anti rationally as possi-
ble.

As for my qualifications of
Black music I guess that all de-
pends on your criteria, doesn't it"
If it's the amount of records
listened to (as you suggest) that
should be considered, it has been
more than a I‘ewiwell over a
thousand Would be more accurate.

books by such important critics as
Andre lliidier, lieroi Jones,
(itiiillier Schullei', Nat l'lenloff

reading I)tlII'Il lteut magazine is of
great assistance in fortning an edu-

music played by wliites'.’ Not a
comfortable suggestion, is it‘.’

As for psychedelic music being
“merely an attempted take-ol'fon
Black music" I believe you are
confusing being imitatn'e with Ill“
ing influenced by. The Rolling

Stones for example are not imitat-
ing 8.3. King (they sound quite
differently) btit there can be no
question that King has influenced
them either directly or indirectly.
I think my not having soul is a
very moot point. But l find it
rather amusing that around the
beginning of this century white
classical musicians Were accusing
black jazz musicians of not having
soul. That type of inVective is
usually a last resort. At any rate
soul has nothing to do with skin.
By the way it might be a good
idea to read my review before you
criticize it. If you paid as much
heed to what I wrote as you did
to my religious origin you would
have discovered that I liked Issac
Hayes as well as you; And the
album also with some reservation.
You might be surprised to find
out how much soul music is
drenched with gimmicks at the
direction of a white producer, not
because he has soul, but to make a

fast buck.

‘Sympathy’ And ‘Wind From East’

Show Godard’s

by Toni Quiqley

Jean-Luc Godard's SYMPATHY
FOR THE DEVIL is a film about
revolution, fascism, democracy,
and media of all kinds including
music, literature, and of course
film, Those who believe that the
movie is pure “revolutionary”
cinema, howeVer, have been hood-
winked by a master satirist.

The themes and messages of
revolution are there but Godard ’s
presentation of realism is sugar-
coated. Somehow it cannot be
taken that seriously. The film
stars the Rolling Stones, who are
.. ing their way through a re
cortliiig session of their song
Sympathy for the Devil. They
can't. seem to get together and
(iodard uses the metaphor of their
disoriented jam session to illus-
trate the confusion within the
movement.

The film i« 'ircular in nature and
(lodard's emphasis is upon cireu-
lar images, dialogues, and intricate
camera movements that follow
circular patterns. The film has
llit'l'i‘llll)ly forceful and hilarious
moments.

tional use of montage anti lets his

sometimes tedious lengths of film.
(iodard's Marxist lcnrnings tend to
make him didactic but there is
much in what he says that is hard
truth.

It is only when (lodard the artist
lapses into propaganda, in the

Master Touch

Watching Godard ‘s latest, and of
this moment, still unreleased, film
THE WIND FROM THE EAST, is
like watching documentary fool.-
age captured from a raid on a
Vietcong outpost. It is repetitious,
boring, scatologieal, humorless,
and quite frankly it halfwitted
exercise in amateur cinema.
Godurd's View of revolution is no
longer satiric but deadly earnest.
and thus totally non-objective.

This righteous propaganda film
extoils the hardlinc mindlessness
of Red Chinese rhetoric. Soviet
and American"imperialists"are the
target of the cultural revolution's
wrath. It is obvious that Godard
believes that. the don‘iinant. force
in social change is the “east
wind."

Godard 's studentsare as thought-
less and naive a group of revolu~
tionaries that you'll ever witness,
as they come to grips with power
politics. They understand that in
order to make their revolution
work, they need the support of
the bourge  'aves.

Yet they foolishly fantasize that
all workers are united in some
universal struggle against the capi-
talists when, in reality, the majori-
ty of middle class union members
would rather kill a radical than a
rich employer. The \vorkers want
to be rich. The revolutionaries
think that they want to be liberal
i~(l.

This futile exercise in radical
philosophy only exposes the sad
decay of a man whose past work
has been challenging and enjoy-
able. 'l‘lll£ WIND FROM THE

EAST resembles a poorly thought
out, executed home movie, made
in someone's backyard with the
neighborhood kids. If this is
(iodard‘s idea of ptire “revolution-
ary cinema" then Godard is no-
thing but a pure fool.

D: a ry 0f
by Tom Quigley

Frank and Eleanor Perry’s adap-
tation of Sue Kaufman’s DIARY
OF A MAD HOUSEWIFE is their
sixth and most penetratiing analy-
sis of modern mores.

The ﬁlm is theatrical in its con-
ception which tends to diminish
its cinematic potential. Yet the
Perry's craftsmanship, coupled
with the dynamic performances of
the cast, weaves an engrossing
satire about social climbers who
are nothing more than urbane
savages.

The victim is one Tina Balzer
(Carrie Snodgress), an average, un-
imaginative woman who has been
trained to be unnssertive and sub-
missive. She plays the role of the
bland. efficient housewife almost
as well as her husband Jonathan
(Richard Benjamin) plays the suc—
cess game.

Johathiin has a consumer pro-
duct mentality. He sees everything
in terms of brand names, social
connections, and “creative potenA
tial." Tina is just another object in
a collection of expensive status

Tune In

 

This album deals basically in
avantc guarde jazz and seems to
verify Alan Heineman's theory
about the similarity between it
and rock. There is, in both forms,
an attempt to pack each moment.
with interest before moving on,
thus a feeling of non mobility
rather than swing; or as Heineman
says: Verticle rather than horizon»
tal. This imposes a difficult prob-
lem for the jazz man and in this
case the reason for their inability
to grapple with the situation
which sometimes causes an aura
of dullness.

“Tune In" is a simple Eastern
melody that is harsh and deep,
with firy vibes and a drone bass.
The bass and flute then play
melody in counterpoint. for i
couple rounds until the bass is
isolated to slowly develop the
theme. There are also occ'sional
interfections by Berger's sarangi,
an Eastern string instrument. that
is boWed and sounds like a raspy
violin.

"With Silence“ is played with a
trio a very slow and moody piece
with Blackwell concentrating on
toms. “(ii-l Up" is notable for its
clarity while being very Cecil
'l'aylor-lilte in conception. There
he some blurry rims on vibes a
delightfully statement
and, considering the tempo at
which it is executed, well thought

“Fly” is much the same type of
song aiul Berger handles some
startling rims with ease with only
a bass accompaniment. Flute later
joins with a full sound which
seems to be more of importance
for its tonal qualities, than the
actual ideas. The sarangi found its
way in. Blackwell plays some
George of the Jungle licks behind
Holland's bass lines.

"Beyond the Moon“ has some
alto from Ward who has an origi-
nal concept, but is not very excit»
ing. This song also has Berger‘s

Her method of sexual-social lib-
eration is an affair with a hand-
some hack (Frank Langella)
whose sadistic egocentricity is
greater than his writing ability.
The paradoxical conclusion of the
Perry's thesis is cynically clear.
Tinn is still an object in both her
marriage and affair. The problem
and nature of this tragedy is her
limited emotional and educational
conditioning, that molds her into
it non-person.

The problem also lies with Mrs.
Perry‘s scenario that for a change
avoids the heavy symbolism of
their past efforts and concen-
trates on subtlety of content. For
all its witty insight into the mores
of the skyscraper set, her use of
latrine language is sort of sopho-
moric.

People swear casually in their
daily intercourse with each other

me. After a few hell: and damn-
subtlety and maturity of purpose
tend to be blugeoncd to death by
the pretentious dialogue. Unfor-
tunately this is becoming an irri-
tating trademark of Mrs. Perry's.

Yet her characterizations of the
three principles, including two of
the most obnoxious children
you’ll ever see on the screen, are
brilliant and the actors' interpreta-
tions are inspired.

Newcomer Currie Snodgress, as
Tina, in not as average and plain-
looking as the publicity people
would have you believe. She is a
charming performer with a laryn-
gitis voice and a lovely counten-
ance. She turns in a sympathetic,
credible performance as the mad
housewife.

The chauvinistic characters of
the males are established from the
outset. Dick Benjamin is so in-
credibly obnoxious and hilarious
that you hope he’ll choke on his
sarcasm. Frank Langelln is superb
as the lover-writer. His snide wise
cracks are calculated to drain
every bit of pleasure out of emo-
tional experiences. Yet under the
callous surface of his battering
ram sexuality purrs the heart of a
pussycat. Puzzle that one out.
symbolists!

Frank Perry's fluid direction is
of primary interest because of his
use of the principles within con-
fining sets. Most of the action
takes place within the limited
four-walled world of the mud
housewife. This enables Perry to
stimulate an intimate atmosphere
as the actors go through their
series of confrontations.

His eye for muted color and
texture is equally fascinating.
Gerald Hirshficld's beautiful soft
focus photography enables Perry
to explore the textures of cloth-
ing, skin tones, and other in-
animate objects, utilizing to the
tullest the powers of the objective
camera. The editing and judicuous
use of the closeup, help to rein-
force movement and intimate mo-
tivation within the storyline.

The Perry's are not easy film-
makers. Their films dissect the
social foibles of our species and
continually force us to face the
mirror of self-knowledge and cyni—
cal truth. DIARY OF A MAD
l’lOUSEWlFE is one more in their
chain of mirrors.
