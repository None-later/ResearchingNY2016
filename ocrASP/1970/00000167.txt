receiver is Chris Kringle. What.
makes the home teams offense
that. much more dangerous is the
fact that. they use deceptions such
as screen passes ttnr'. draw plays to
keep the defense honest.

Obviously, there will be it lot, of
pressure on the defensive line to
contain Plttttsburg's good running
game, and tit the same time put.
pressure on DeNnto. Tom Potter-
son's exceptional game at safety
last week (ll interceptions) earned

Harriers End Fine Season of 10-3

by Robert Mcrctt

Coach Bob Munscy‘s cross
countrymen entertained LeMoyno
this past Tuesday and suffered ti
rare loss by it score of 25-110.
Dennis l'lthkulL orfcc tigtiin led

Coach Munsey noted that. his men
did a good overall job in finishing
the season with it 10-3 record. If
they had pulled off this lttsl meet,
thoy Would have finished with an

matched the Loam record number

Still remaining on the schedule is
the ICIIA Meet in Vim Corllttnd

Dr-Mttrco will represent State.
Looking forward to next. year.
only Pitt Gtrpl'ori will be grud-

wins held by Tom Robinson. With
15 wins in 2 years of running he
appears to be well within range.

Finally, I think we should all
take note of the Harriers fine
performance. In Coach Munsey’s
9 years with the team they boast
an outstanding record of 77-15
and have 9 consecutive winning
seasons behind them. Both the
couch and the men who devote
precious time and energy to the
sport should be heartily congrat-
ulttled.
