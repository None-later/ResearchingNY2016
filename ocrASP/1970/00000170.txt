THE AIRPLANE

'l‘he sell-out crowd was greeted by heuvy security when admitted to the gym mound 9PM. Signs warned
the nudience to “Think-Don’t Smoke." rind before the concert begun, Larry Brown, in member of the
student body, made the same request.

 

Once Slick

by Roy xmd Shirley

At 9:30PM, u folksinger from California, Burt Summers, performed. His first song-Get Together-he
wrote himself. It was his most outstanding selection.

At 10zl5, the Airplane, led by
Oracle Slick. finully appeared.
They played nine selections at the
first concert. including “Somebo-
dy to Love," “White Rabbit," und
“Volunteers.”

The Glen McKuy Light Show
which nppeured with the Airplane
wus (lisuppointing, und the sound
in the gym, ns usunl, left some-
thing to be desired.

Although the Airplane wus only
worming up during the first. con-
cert. the nudience was very deeply
involved with them by the end of
the evening.

During A twmily minute version
of "Volunteers," n mujority of
[hose present were on their feet.
Slick sung of revolution, und lights
l'oeussed on the Amerii'nn flog.

The concert ended at l l :45 I’M.

Al tluI second convert. only the
Airplnne nppeun-(l. 'l‘hv perfor-
lnnm‘e hosted from lztltlAM to
ulmosl four in the morning.

The first convert Wllh' good. The
M-rontl convert wns phenomennl.
