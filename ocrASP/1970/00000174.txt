Danes Try For .500 Season Vs. HVCC Sat.

by John Carter

The Great Dane football team
invaded the north country Satur-
day and was repulsed by a fired
up Plattsburgh eleven 28-0. The
long breakaway run proved to be
Albany's undoing. As Coach Bob
Ford stated, “We played two
games Saturday. In one of them
our defense gave up 200 plus
yards and 28 points in four plays.
In the other we held them to 130
yards in fifty-eight plays.” Unfor-
tunately the first game for over-
shadowed the second because the
offense proved too inconsistent to
mount a sustained drive.

Quarterback Dee DeNato broke
away 54 yards for the first
Plattsburgh score early in the first
period. Keith Wheeler scored from
60 yards out later in that stanza.
In the third quarter halfback John
Carpenter capped a 70 yard l2
play drive with a 23 yard scoring
run. The last Cardinal tally came
in the fourth quarter on a 55 yard
run by second string quarterback
Gary Ross.

The Dane offense sputtered be-
cause of numerous small mistakes.
Fumbles, missed blocks, etc. pre-
cluded a Dane score. One of the
main reasons the offense proved
to be ineffective was the loss of

senior quarterback Bill Flanagan.
The complex triple-option offense
which Coach Ford is using this
year depends heavily on an experi-
enced quarterback who can
quickly read the moves of the
defensive tackle and end, and then
make the appropriate handoff or
keep it himself. Flanagan, despite
not having great physical ability
was able to do this and thus made
the Dane offense go much in the
manner that James Street moved
Darrel Royal's Texas team last
year. Rick Petty and Gordie
Kupperstein don't quite have the
experience to do this yet though
Petty, who has matured under
fire, is coming on strong in this
respect. Look for Rick to start
this weekend.

Coach Ford stated that, "The
team gave 100 % at all times. it's
just that too often a block was
missed or a fumble made." Players
cited l'or playing a line game were
Steve Finn at defensive tackle,
Nick Conte at linebacker, and
John Johnson at cornerback. On
offense tacke Phil Lord, halfback
Bernie Boggs and quarterback
Petty rated a nod from their
coach for fine efforts.

Saturday's loss was especially
disappointing because it was felt

THE ATTENDANCE AT the first two home football games was very impressive. This Saturday at

Coach Ford figures that this as-
pect is very important to a new,
relatively inexperienced team such
as Albany and the record seems to
back the Coach up as the fledgling
Danes are 2-0 at home while 0-3
on the road. It is therefore impor-
tant that everyone go to the game
Saturday and support the football
team.

 
   

I:00 p.m.. the team will meet a very tough Hudson Valley eleven. They need your support now more

than they did for the other encounters. This is your team; support it!

Season

by Jay Marshall

“We‘re at least 50% ahead of
where we were at this point last
year," said Couch Richard Saucrs,
noting the progress of this year's
varsity basketball team after a
scrimmage against the University
of Hartford. Sauers has reason to
be optimistic with starters Jack
Jordan, Al Reid, Jim Masterson
and Steve Sheehan returning.
Four prospects from last year's
freshman team have moved up to

the varsity along with transfer
students Bob Rossi and John
Quattrochi.

Competition for the starting
positions has been fierce. Sauors
remarked that none of the starting
slots has been filled, but added
that either Quattrochi or Dave
Welchons, who starred for the
freshmen, can be expected to take
over the guard slot vacated by
Jack Adams' graduation. Expect
the Great Danes to employ the

However, as Coach Sauers says
“In order to fast break, you must
first get the rebounds." A new

The first part of the schedule,
which includes the Seventh Annu-
al Pocono Classic Tournament in
East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania,
will be the toughest since most of
the games will be played on the

Future Uncertain For Harriers.

by Robert Mirett

Coach Bob Munsey assessed his
cross-countrymen's season as be-
ing "only good. Virus attacks
were what prevented an outstand-
ing year." In retrospect, thoug,
the Harriers’ 10-3 record included
losses to three top-rated teams—
Colgate, CW. Post and LeMoyne,
It was definitely the team's tough-
est schedule in its nine years and
their best meets as a team this
year were against RPI, Siena, and
the Coast Guard. The coach noted
that the men Won often and run
well early in the season before
being bogged down at the close.
The biggest disappointment of the
year was winding up with the loss
to LeMoyne and the poor running
against Colgate where the Harriers
had a chance at an upset. That
loss, to Colgate's best team ever,
stole a great deal ol‘ initiative
away from the Danes. "in cross
country, without great depth, one
or tw0 men getting injured can
really hurt a team," said Munsey,
"and that's what happened to us.“

In reviewing the varsin runners,
Dennis l-lackett ran very Well but
had his ups and downs. He ran no
truly outstanding races but had
several good ones. He‘s a junior
and will be very tough to heal

next year. Nick De Marco was
"the brightest mark of the team"
in Coach Munsey‘s opinion and
along with fellow freshman John
Koch they will form a formidable
duo in years to come. Co—captains
Pat Gepfert and Bill Meehan, kept
the team in order and fired up but
the “hard luck guy had to be John
Comerford, a sophomore, and lo-
cal boy from Catholic Central in
Troy." He run much too hard in
the summer and when it came to
the actual season he was “stale,”
related Munsey. “Later on he
came down with a deep throat
infection and never (lid reach the
times he had run in the summer.
Staleness refers to a mental state
where a peak is reached followed
by a mental regression, while
physically speaking, nothing hap-
pens. Larry Frederick, who was
the Danes’ top runner in 1968,
had his leg broken Very badly last
year and had it in a casl for eleven
months. in effect, he was far off
his pi'i-Vlous limos and nflcr each

prospects on the J.V. include
Joseph Riley, William Sorel and
Terry Slocum.

In the short-range future the
team appears to be much tough-
er next year as there are a
number of runners, waiting on the
sidelines who can run with or
ahead of Hackett. In the long
range, the Harriers will get better
and better but the opposition
seems to be getting better and
quicker and at a faster rate than
we are. Teams we have previously
beaten have begun to beat us even
though we‘ve gotten better, is the
way the coach put it. The univer-
sity has an unrealistic approach to
recruiting and “we just can't get
the kids in the school" (prospects
ivc cross countrymen, with 89-90
averages and regent scholarship
scores in the 240's, have been
rejected admission).

With competition for athletic
mail-rial so l'icrcc nowadays lhc

long as lhc universin continues its
present policy of rccruilmcnt.
