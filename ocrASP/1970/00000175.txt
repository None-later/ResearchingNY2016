DAY CARE CENTER: PROMISE AND PROBLEMS

 

by Debbie Natanson

Contrary to popular belief, the
Day Care Center is alive and Well,
and living in Pierce Hall. Con-
struction will be finished on Nov-
ember 13th, earlier than sche-
duled, and most equipment has
already been purchased. But
two problems remain unsolved:
first, whether the Day Care Center
will be able to operate after June,
1971, and secondly, whether it
will be autonomous.

only twa representatives. This
denies a basic premise of the Day
Care Center-that it should be
parent~controlled and thus auto-
nomous. At a recent board meet-
ing, Women's Lib lender Liz Ewen
declared that the “entire board
should be made up of parents and
staff.” No control by the School
of Social Welfare or any other
administration bureau is desired.

Aside from the question of mon-
ey, representatives from the Wom-
en's Liberation Front, whose ef-
forts resulted in the creation of
the Day Care Center, are dissat-
isfied with the control that the
administration has over the cen-
ter. The Women‘s Lib group has
been given only three representa-
tives on the board of directors of
the center, with parents getting

The problem of funding for the
center past this fiscal year is one
of crucial importance. At a recent
meeting of State University Pres-
idents, it was decided that school-
run day care centers should be
self-supporting and that state
funds should not be used to sup-
port them. HoweVer, a study was
ordered to look into the matter.
At the present time, Albany
State’s Day Care Center is funded
by a $10,000 grant, unfrozen SA
funds, and surplus budget monies.
Thus, our Day Care Center is the

Another problem with jets is

Not many people know that
General Electric started building a jet
engine in 1941. America’s first jet
engine.

That jet produced only 1200
pounds of thrust.

Our newest jet, for the DC-10,
produces around 50,000 pounds
of thrust.

In the early days of jet aviation,
the important thing was thrust.

But suddenly our skies are filled
with jets. And, suddenly, jet pollution
is a major problem,

General Electric tackled it head
on when building the DC-10 engines.
And we accomplished two things.

When you see the 0010 take
to the air, you’ll see no black marks
against the sky. Because the engines
make virtually no smoke.

Of course, there’s more to jet
exhaust than just smoke. Our goal is

General Electric has been
working on noise, too.

GE was chosen by the federal
government to help solve this
problem for the aviation industry. At
present, we know of no way a
powerful turbofan engine can be
made noiseless. But we've made
progress in that direction.

The DC-lO engines, for instance,
are quieter than any jet engincs on
the passenger planes of the Sixties.
Quicter, even though they’re more
than three times as powerful.

We have more work to do
before we’ll satisfy all the people
concerned about jcl pollution,
ourselves included. But because 10022,

only one being run by State
funds. Whether or not this will be
allowed to continue is in doubt.
President Louis T. Benezet has
vowed to lobby in favor of the
continuation of the Day Care Cen-
ter. A supplemental budget
request will be submitted in Man
ch (when the fiscal year ends) so
that the center may be funded at
least until June. After that it‘s
anyone's guess.

In answer to this, it was decided
that the present board, which
includes administration represent
atives, would be temporary, until
the Day Care Center was set up
and running on its own. No spec-
ific date was decided upon for ;i
new board to be chosen.

A specific date was set. up, how-
ever, for the opening of the cen-
ter-- December 1st. The once
dingy, dark basement library of
Pierce Hall is now a cheery, car-
peted, white room with knee-high
sinks and plenty of play area.
Fourteen children are now enroll-
ed and about 35 applications in all
have been received. The center has
room for 46 children, 16 of which
will be infants.

Mrs. Blair Barrett, director of
the Day Care Center, has said that
financial aid will be the basis for
admitting children. This is because
of the high cost of baby-sitting in
the home. The center will be using
the same schedule of fees that the
welfare department uses for wele
fare recipients, starting out at 50
cents per week and going up to If)
dollars per week depending on the
income of the parents. There are
still openings, so anyone with any
range of income can still apply.

At the present time, more
applications have been processed
for infants than for older children.
The apparent reason for the num‘
ber of infant applications is the
fact that Albany‘s Day Care Cen-
ter is almost unique in the hand-
ling of babies as young as six
months. Very few facilities are
available to house babies so that a
mother can study or Work. The
infants at the center will have
their own room equipped with
cribs and diaper-changing fac»
ilities. All age groups will have
both indoor and outdoor activit-
ies. Although toys have already
been purchased, donations of
mm record players, a TV, tri-
cycles, toy cars, or anything
imaginable will be gratefully ac-
cepted.

The Day Care Center, then, pro-
mises to be a successful and happy
place for the children to lie at the
present time, But what about
plans for the future? There are
certainly enough facilities for e
xpansion, but will the administra-
tion be able to provide the money
so that more and more people can
take advantage of the center?
Mrs. Barrett would like to see the
Day Care Center “expanded as far
as it. can go...openetl not only to
students but to faculty, staff, and
the community as well.“

The only chance for this occur-
ring iind for the continuance of a
day care center as promising as
this one is the acquisition of slatt-
funds. It is up to the admin
istriition to convince the budget
directors and the Chancellor that
it is essential for ii univr-rsily
community such as ours to NW .i
duy care center. and that state
funds should support it. President
Benezet said, in regard to the Day
Care Center, "To me, this is it i'l'dl
Venture." All those concerned
with thiI center hope that llll‘
venture turns out to be ll success
ful one.

 

FIVE, EASY PIECES “New
*IG’A’IWHG’ A Must-See For All

FIVE EASY PIECES is the
greatest, most humane ﬁlm I've
seen this year. It is so hard to
convey, through language, the
wealth of human emotion that
this movie evokes. Language, how-
ever, is the only thing we have
besides the physical means of ex-
pression, to communicate those
feelings of affection and love be-
tween one another. Yet if there
ever was a film that tried to reach
out for its audience, then it is
surely this one. FIVE EASY PIE-
CES is a film with a soul.

Jack Nicholson, who stole the
“easy ride" from Fonda and
Hopper, plays Robert Dupea, a
concert trained pianist, who runs
away from his cultured past to the
tough, oil-rigging fields of the
southwest in search of the solu-
tion to his restless dissatisfaction
with life. His self-centered alien-
ation, however, prevents him from
really understanding or caring
from those people surrounding
him.

He treats his scatterbrained girl
friend Rayette, played with great
warmth and anxious humor by
Karen Black, like a disposable
beer can, Dupca is as indifferent
to his co-workers as he is to his
family, a group of artistic snobs
who act as callous as he does.

The only one he seems to have
any real relationship with is his
sister, and yet he occasionally lies
to her as well. To say he is a cold
hearted bastard is too simple. Like
