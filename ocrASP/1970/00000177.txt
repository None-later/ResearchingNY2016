National trade experience indicates that we must rt-ccivu an
average markup of 213% to 28% on the items that we sell, to
meet handling costs. The publishers who regulate markup of
textbooks allow bookstores only a 20% markup. Since we give
a 5% discount, we receive only a 15% markup. which is well
below that needed to meet our operational costs. We must try
to make up this deficit by handling higher margin sundry items
that are desired by our customers.

The second barrier to lower prices in our facility, is lack of
storage space. At this time we only have one set of storage
shelves for all of our non-book itomsl This forces us to buy in
small quantities. which have few. if any wholesale discounts.

Navajo Food Fast
Organized by STB

by Harry Weiner

For the past three years, the
brothers of Sigma Tau Beta (STB)
have organized a food fast. They
have encouraged students on cam-
pus to give up their contract
dinners for one night so that Food
Service might donate the cost of
the meal to some worthwhile
charity. This Thursday night, No-
vember 19, the brothers are again
asking that we give up our meals.
The proceeds will go to one of our
nation's most forgotten minority
groups, the American Indian.

All monies collected from this
year's food fast will go towards
the creation of it Navajo Commu-
nity College in Arizona. Working
with the American Society of
Friends‘ (Quakers) Indian Aid

more than the $2700 donated to
the struggling nation of Biafra last
year.

Bobby Cole, chairman of the
fast, re-enforced the idea that
when you sign the petitions on
the meal lines, you are not obli-
gating yourself in any manner.
These lists will only be used to
give the chefs iit the various Quads
an idea on how much food to
prepare. Whether or not you sign
the list, the mere fact that you
don't eat dinner that night will
allow Food Service to give more
money to the Friends Society's
program,

If you give up your meal Thurs-
day night, you'll be giving up very
little to gain an awful lot. A8 STB

distributed around the campus.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Albany Restaurant Owner
Clashes with Students

by Bob Warner
News Editor

Cosimo, the proprietor of the
Italian Restaurant on Western
Avenue across the street from the
university, had confiscated n cos-
tomer's wallet on the condition
that he pay $l75, the amount
that Cosimo had lost on checks
over the past semester that had
not been paid. Cosimo had done
this because that customer and
two students beat a $4 check.
That took place on November 7,
Saturday night. The following is
the story according to Don
Williams, a freshman, who became
the key person in the incident
with Cosimo, although he was not
with the three people who did not
pay the check.

As the three customers were
leaving Cosimo's, the check un-
paid. about five people, bystand-
ers. employees of Cosimo's, and
Cosimo himself chased the three
down the block. Only one person
was caught, and he paid the bill
upon demand. On his way out,
though, he met Cosimo and sev-
eral others who made the chase.
In the vestibule at the entrance.
the person was hit a few times on
his face with the palm of one
man. Then Cosimo took the stu-
dent aside, warned him that he
wouldn't get off so easily, and

asked him for his ID.

Cosimo then seized the wallet
and demanded that he pay all of
Cosimo's unpaid checks. which
came out to $176. Only on the
condition that the, person pay the
money Would he get his wallet
back. The student did not protest,
though, because he was too fright-
ened to argue while a few men
were‘ surrounding him.

The three who had skipped pay-
ing the check went back to the
dorm on campus, and told a
friend, Dan William, about the
incident. Dan called Cosimo on
the phone, but the latter refused
to talk over the phone, but sug-
gested that Dan come in person if
he had any complaints. Therefore,
Dan went to Cosimo's about 1:00
am. Sunday morning. only a
short time after the incident.

Cosimo told Dan to leave his
establishment, but Dan demanded
the wallet; he threatened to call
the police if Cosimo did not meet
his request. Cosimo refused to
hand back the wallet, and sub-
sequently, Dun called the police.
The Albany police, upon arrival,
told Dan that the incident was
none of his business and thiit
nothing could he done without
the three who had been impli-
cated. Dan then asked the police
to wait ten minutes for his
friends, which they agreed to do.

Dan asked Cosimo if he could
use the public telephone that was
in his restaurant. Cosimo denied
permission. The Albany police de-

fended the proprietor's refusal,
but let Dan' use the phone Inv-
way. The ofﬁcer talked to the
students over the phone and aid
thatthe wallet could be picked up
the following afternoon.

Dan then asked the police if
Cosimo had broken the law.
Again, he was warned to mind his
own business. Therefore, Dan said
“It figures. Typical Albany
police.“ No sooner said than
done, Dan was friaked, arrested,
and taken down by paddy wagon
to jail. The charge was public
intoxication; Dan had not been
intoxicated at that time, though.

Without being advised of his
rights, Dan was in jail. All his
things were taken, so he. wouldn't
hang himself. He had aakedifhe
could make a call. The reply was
“Later.” Dan never had a chance
to use the phone, however.

At 7:00 am. Sunday morning, a
few of Dan’s friends who had
found out what happened paid
the $10 bail for his release. The
trial was two hours later; Sandy
Rosenbloom, the Student Associ-
ation lawyer, was there to counsel
him. Rosenbloom advised Dan to
plead guilty. which he did. He was
uncondtionally discharged. If he
had pleaded not guilty, he would
have had to face Judge Tepedino.
Furthermore, he would have faced
insurmountable odds, because it
would have been his word against
the word of two policemen and
Cosimo.
