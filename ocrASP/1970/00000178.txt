F SA Expenditures Probed

Central Council, in an unusually
brief session, “appropriated
$2,544.50 to the Athletic Advi-
sory Board from the Athletic Sur-
plus" for the Athletic Recruit-
ment program. The advocates of
the bill argued that the monies
from the surplus had to be spent
on athletics, anyway, therefore it
would be better to spend restrict-
ed funds than not at all. The
opponents, who were in the mi-
nority, said that Central Council,
at any rate, should retain its pow-
er over athletic expenditures, even
.though its power has been eroded

over the past few years.

Council also, in the form of a bill,
urged the Administration to
create an Environmental Studies
Department. The bill was declared
a white ballot, which designates
wholehearted and unanimous as-
sent.

Although Council members, nor-
mally laconic, were denied a
three-and-one-half hour session
which was common in the Coun-
cils of yesteryear, they did pass
judgment on some relatively im-
portant issues. Council questioned
some of FSA’s expected expendi-

7 W05 bl »

It has struck me that the features editor either has a strange sense of
humor or is a sadist; asking me to do an article on WFLY and WRPI is
tantamount to requesting Richard Nixon to write an objective essay

on the Vietcong. It was probably
accepted.

out of morbid curiousity that I

l was told, “Students on this campus love to listen to music; they
wake, sleep, eat, study, mp, and God knows what else they do to it.
Find out what students might want to know about the programming
philosophy and operations of two of the most listened-to stations on

campus." So I hopped into "Obie"

(a dumpy old Mercury) and took

off forTroywith pen between my toes and wife by my side.

When WFLY began operations
in 1948, their purpose was to
provide classical music without
profit, working only with
listener's contributions. By late
1968 and early 1969, WFLY,
owned by the Tray Record news-
paper, was losing money rapidly.
Up until that time WFLY was
considered th best classical pro-
grammer in the Capital District,
yet contributions from listeners
were insufficient to support star
tion operations. In the summer of
1969, the former WFLY program
director decided to move to an
easy-listening format, generally
called "M.O.R." in the industry
(“middle of the road”). This move
simply plunged WFLY into keener
competion with WROW, WGFM,
ngm, WDKC, and WABY.

With WFLY’s ratings down in
the dumps, former listeners ab-
horring the new format, and the
station still losing money, the
time was right for John Walker.

John Walker graduated from
RPl last year, hailing originally
from Long Island; he served WRPI
as program director from January
l968 to January 1969. Early last
slimmer Walker took over as pro-
gram director of WFLY. He plun-
ned on programming for a young
adult audience, ages 15 through
115, with the better music from
top lIO, bona-l'idc oldies, and pop-
ular album cuts, He revolutionized
the WFLY format according to
the nationally proven “Drake”
formula.

John Walker doesn't particularly
like to have WF‘LY typed this
way, yet WFl,Y today will remind
anyone fI - New York Met-
ropolitan. if WORmFM and
for good run To understand
WOR and Wild, and over 50
other stations in the United
States, we must diverge briefly to
Bill Drake.

Bill Drake is a popular mumc
programmer who is generally con-
sidered the most inl'lucniialmun in
the industry today. Through his
consultant service,
Drake-Chemiult, nine AM radio
stations and forty FM stations in
the biggest advertising markets
and throughout the country havu

all their music, jinglcs,
commercials and nch formats
programmed. Some of Drake's

clients pay a face that can exceed
liilill),iltlll for this service. Ills pro-

gram ideas are psychologically
insidious, but consequently
always popular, Within a few
months after the Illi‘l‘plitlli of

Drulu- nl WOR l“M|n New York
(lily, \V()l( bccumc lhc second-
Illlisl-llsl.t‘lll'tl-l.(> station in the
illi'll.

The format is successful because
Drake i-mpluys n crowd-pleasing
philosophy; his l'in'muln mixos less
raucous rock w1th lhc latest hits,
Ulllll'S with album cuts, slow cuts
With uptempo music, Illillt‘ with
female artists. lllltl so on. Drake
pmgrulmnmg Is "light." it doesn't
wash- a second. The announcer
lnlks happily, confidently, but
lt'l‘i'it'ly over the introduction of a
song, giving, basically, informa-
tion: time, temperature, etc. Each
record just barely ends when a
transitory a cupcllu (all voice)
jingle flows into the next song or
commercial. The formqu is

psychologically insidious because
the music becomes very uncon-
sciously predictable to the lis-
tener. For instance: a last song is
coming to a close; a jingle starts
immediately; the singers might
sing "W—-F-—L—-Y Stereo” quick-
ly, followed by "in Troy"slowly,
and the next song starts
immediately, and, of course, it is a
slow tune. In short, the jingle
gives away the tempo of the fol-
loving song, though the listener is
not conscious of his forekno-
wlede.

John Walker at WFLY did not
seek the services of Drake-
Chcnault; he took their format,
adapted it to the Capital District‘s
needs, and employed a few inno-
vations of his own, like “College
Calendar" and carefully spaced
ten-minute newscasts. Recog-
nizing that albums are now more
popular than 45's, Walker features
more album cuts and slightly less
gold and top 40 than most Drake
stations. .u . .

Walker continually seeks balance
in WFLY‘s programming; he per-
sonally programs every song you
hear for balance. Old songs alter-
nate with new, mule artists alter-
nate with female, fast songs al-
ternate with slow ones. The music
is not as “teeny-bopperish" as AM
stations, nor as “heavy” as WRPI.

Walker told me that he wants:
(1) listener involvement, a feeling
that the listener is part of the
station; and (2) to program just
what his audience wants to hear.
To facilitate this he established a
request line last month, along
with “Community” and “College”
Calendars. Any Capital District
non-profit high school or college
group may air their news of cum-
pus activities—concerts, meetings,
plays, rallies, sports events, or
movies—free on WFLY. In addi-
tion, Mr. Walker invites listeners'
commean and suggestions.

I told John that I first discov-
ered the new WFLY inadvertently
last summer, while dialing for
WRPI; WFLY is at 92.3 on the
dial, WRPI is at 9] .5. John smiled
wryly and said, "We're quite
aware that. it 's advantageous for us
in be neighbors; that‘s how we get
many of our listeners." Good
luck, neighbor!

 

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

 i

WFLY—FM Stereo and WRPl--
FM Stereo work on two diverse
programming philosophies, each
suited to meet their needs. WFLY
is a commercial station, owned
and operated by the Troy Record
newspaper; frankly, their business
is make money through their
popularity and attraction to spon-
sors. WRPI is an activity subs
sidized by the Student Union at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute;
frankly, station members Want to
have a good time programming
music most appealing to students
at their school and throughout the
Capital District.
n-ﬂensselaer is an engineering
school, and most students have a
very heavy academic load. Thus
the radio station serves as a release
for students, a source of diversion,
entertainment, or an outlet for
creativity and ideas.

And so what is heard over WRPI
and what goes on behind the
scenes is a result of a collective
effort on the part of the staff,
with relatively few structures and
pragmatic or financial demands.

I talked with program directress,
Sheila Fields, as she did her Fri-
day evening show, and i realized
how differently the role of pro-
grum director was perceived at
WRPI in contrast to acommerciul
station. Probably quite expectedly
for in student effort, the program
director is not perceived as a

person with absolute control.
With control comes conformity
and less creativity. Sheila

perceives her role as a peace-

ltceper and coordinator.
Without any concretely

espoused radio philosophy to go
by we cun probably understand
WRPI best by observing their cur-
rent. format and deciphering its
character from that.

WRPI

 

 

Sheila Fields explained that pro-
grams from 7 AM until 6 PM are
mildly controlled because daytime
personnel are not always as adept
at selecting music as the night-
time personalities. To insure unity
in programming and good selec-
tions of music, a music committee
of three or four people audition
albums constantly for appealing
songs with which they create a
format list. From 700 to 900
albums are set aside for the day-
time formut. and hundreds of
songs from these albums are
placed on a computerized list
which, ideally, is rotated every
three days. In any event, daytime
personnel (lo select the individual
songs and the order in which they
are played by themselves. Their
only limitation is the several hun-
(lred albums on format, not a very
serious limitation at all.

The personnel who take over the
air waves after 6 in the evuning are
the tried and true performers ut
WRPI. They included Marek, Pat
Pending, Steve Schreiber, Julia,
the Walrus, and other assorted
gentle creatures. Night-time peo-
ple generally are discouraged from
using any of the format material
from the daytime.‘l‘hisis to insure
diversity of music and greater
exposure of new releases.

With this introductory infurmn'
tion 1' procuctlcd to ask Miss
Fields some questions which had
been on my mind and the minds
of other State students who
periodically tune to WRPI. First, I
asked her why the “Request Line
Oldies Show“ on Sunday nights
was no longer being aired.

“When Rob (Bob Harris) Fried-
man and Jeff (Juy Douglas) Fogg
decided that they couldn‘t handle
the show with their school and
professional radio demands, we
decided that the time could best
be servud in a new jam. format."
(Friedman Works at WFLY and
Fogg Works at WP'l‘li.)

i moved on to the question of
“soul” music and black artists,
pointing out, the obvious deficien-
cy of black music on WRI’I in
proportion to black musical
contributions. My prejudice was
quitc apparent when l boasted of
WSUA's integrated program-
mming and "sotil" and “Latin
soul" fcuturos on Friday night. In
response, Miss I’ll-Ids simply said
that Wltl’l does play artists such
as Sly and the Family Stone,
Richie liuvuns, Miles Davis, and
Sonny Boy Williamson, to name a
few, and that the record compan-
les don't send much black music

   
 

...hochberg

to the station. “Besides, there's
been no interest in it here, until
recently."

I moved on to the topic of news
cOVerage and service to the com-
mu nity. Miss Fields explained that
three to five minutes of news is
given on every hour (although
when challenged she admitted this
is not always true) and that at 6
PM there is a 15 minute news
round-up including sports, weath-
er, and stocks. “Pulse,” an inter-
view program, is a weekly feature
of the news department. And two
pu‘ 'a- service announcements are
given each hour.

The present WRPI staff finds
nine of its members currently
working at local commercial tele-
vision and radio stations. Some-
times the commercial equipment
they find themselves working with
is inferior to or less sophistocated
than the equipment they worked
with at WRPI. In fact, there is an
overwhelmingly cheerful elitism
present at WRPI. it isobviousboth
on-the-uir and off.

 

and

WSUA

After returning from the jour-
ney to Troy, 1 spoke with Joel
Lustig, program director of
WSUA, and learned how he reactv
ed to what I had unearthed there.

Joel spoke candidly of WSUA‘s
dilemma. "We have uprobltmfind-
ing enough talented people to do
this, and with all the production,
engineering, news and puperwark
we have to do We can‘t afford the
luxury of having jocks who want
to do nothing but go on-the-air
for a few hours a week and then
leave the station until the follow-
ing week. We have another prob-
lem: AM transmission, You can’t
blame people for preferring to
listen to im FM stationover us."

'Right now, we must look at
ourselves and realize that our
maximum potential is to serve
fifty-five hundred (lnrm-dWellers
twunty-four hours a day,"

“Well,” I said, “what is WSUA's
main priority?“ To this Joel re-
plied, “To be the immediate stu-
dent sourcc of the news which
affects their lives. Music is second.
We hope to achich a satisfactory
balance."

“Just
Joel.

“A radio stutiun on campus
should try to involve students in
the vital and immediate social
issues in the community. WRPI
doesn't do that at all. "

i had to reply, “is that sour
grapes, my friend?"

“No, that's food for thought,"
smugged Joel smilcly.
