ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

THE DEAD DEPART

by Jeff Burger

Sunday night was very strange. Jane, Bunny. and I arrived on time and ready to go. I remember that
clearly, sitting down in those folding chairs in the monster Washington Avenue Armory.

Then, the clear image of a loud AM. radio dj announcing EUCLID, a local group. They sent out loud
sounds, and danced around on the stage, but sorry to say, it sounded to me like some stoned Hell's Angels
domg a poor imitation of the DEAD and LED ZEPLIN. They carried a lot on volume but they were the
local band, and visions of Rolling Stones successes danced in their heads. Their songs were
indistinguishable from each other, and each took years to end. You kept thinking that they were finished
and that you were that much closer to the DEAD, but they weren't and you weren't.

I spoke with the equipment man for the DEAD, and he promised to try and arrange an interview.

Then, finally, Pacific Gas and Electric. I'd seen them before, and I remember having a great time, but
that's all Iremambered. Home again. They were really tight, but no lasting impression. I do remember that

they played “Are You Ready?".

Then someone walked to the
mike and said, “We‘re having elec-
trical problems and we have tc
clear the area. No reason for
panic, just evacuate; Come back in
an hour, and you Won't need
tickets."

I immediately knew it was a
bomb scare. A lot of people pro
ceedcd to call impoverished
friends to tell them it was a free
concert.

with the DEAD's equipment man:

"The DEAD split for New
York."

“Aren‘t they gonna play?"

“Not with all this shit going on.
I watched them carry out the
equipment.“

It was midnight. On came
Buddy Miles. No announcement
yet.

I was waiting around, wondering
how the crowd would react. At
this point, I knew that they didn‘t
know. Miles asked the audience to
get ready to go through big chan-
ges. “Here it comes" I thought.
No, he played "Changes."

As for his performance, what
can i say? You were there or you
weren't. Very simply, Buddy

         

When We returned, I again spoke ‘

Miles spaced me right out the
window. He was fantastic.

If anybody could ten the crowd
about the DEAD, he could. He
had them on their feet, blindly
following ovary sonnd.

Finally he told them, and did a
few more numbers. Then the
lights Went on and it was over. A
lot of people felt that Buddy
Miles alone was worth the five
dollars. A lot of people still want-
ed to hear the DEAD, but felt
powerless and left. A few hundred
stayed on to shout at the state,
"We want the DEAD" over and
over. They also broke chairs.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1970

 

Busting chairs, like calling in
bomb threats is pretty silly and
kind of sick; but I Would suggt'sl
that anyone who felt that lltcy
didn‘t get what they paid for
should write, call, demand money,
demand the IEAD, boycott
Zebra concerts, organize. Zl‘lra
productions isn't about to loavc
twon- they have too many more
concerts. If enough people .m-
made they‘ll have to act.

I decided to make the must of
things for the moment, and
Bunny Koz, and I left the concI-rl.
skipping into the rain, stoned on
Budd Miles.

talent Band intl orchestra to Begin
New Concert Season this lleelr

Two concerts of particular into:-
est are scheduled at State this
week. On Wednesday and Satur-
day evenings, November 18 and
Nov. 21, the University Concert
Band will perform for the first
time under its new conductor,
Charles Boito, and on Sunday,
Nov. 22, the University— Com-
munity Symphony Orchestra will
be heard in its initial concert
under the direction of Nathan
Gottschalk.

Monday evening the Beethoven
Festival continues on campus with
a program in the Performing Arts
Center Recital Hall at 8:30. Par-
ticipating in the program, “Varia-
tions for Violin, Cello, and
Piano," will be Findlay Cockrcll,
John Gobcrman, Dcnnis
Hcl mrich, and Marvin
Morganstcrn, of the university's
music department.

The Concert. Band is composed of
about 65 students, only a few of
whom are music majors. From
biology to history majors, they
come together three times a week
for rehearsals and ensembles. Last
year the band performed to stand

ing room only crowds at each of
its three concerts, including a
twin-night benefit concert that
raised nearly $1,000 for under-
privileged children in Albany.

Mr. Boito has had extensive musi-
cal experience at the University of
Southern California, in the West
Point Bend, and as the assistanc
conductor of the Yale Build. He
will lead the SUNYA band in a
performance of works by Mendel-
ssohn, Rossini, Ricgger, and Jo-
hann Strauss, as well as conduct
the University Wind Ensemble in a
composition by Richard Strauss.
The band concerts begin at 8130.
They are open to the public at no
charge.

The orchestral concert of Bcct-
hnvcn music will feature the Uni-
versity Singers will Karl Peterson,
conducting, anti instrumental
soloists Stanley l'lummcl, Marvin
Morgcnstern, and Findlay Cock-
rcll. Selections will include “Eg-
mont Overture," Romanzc for Vi-
olin," and “First Piano Concert."
Under the baton of Dr.
Gottschulk for the first time, the
orchestra will begin the program
at 7:30 pm in the PAC Main
Theatre.

Concert Board. Rejects   
Jazz Club Gmcert Proposals.

A campus.jazz club, wishing to
Work with Concert Board after
being refused separate recognition
by CPC under the direction of Sue
Levey who just happens to be a
member of Concert Board (a con-
flict of interest) met with Concert
Board Chairman Mike Glass, fac-
ulty advisor Dennis Elkin and
other members. Jazz Club was
promised the opportunity to have
a jazz concert on November 13.

Arrangements were made by
Jazz Club and explained to Flass.
Glass in turn held a Concert Board
meeting and quietly voted down
the concert without bothering to
inform those to whome he made
the broken promise, hoping to
stall time before they would react.

The rationale behind the veto
was even more absurd. They (CB)
felt thutbecause a concert by the
same man, Roland Kirk, was being

held at nearby Union College, this
would cause the SUNYA concert
to fail. Concert Board was immed-
iately notified that a change in
personnel could be made within
two days. They countered with
the following arguments and were
answered with the following res-
ponses from Jazz Club:

Concert Board: Rock Concerts
within a week of jazz concerts
would decrease attendance of
both.

Jazz Club: Highly unlikely be-
cause there would be two differ-
ent groups of people in attendanCe
Also rock concerts would not be
affected because they are always
sold out and jazz concerts would
not be affected because anyone
who would make a choice would
choose a jazz concert because it is
such a rare event. It seems unlike-
ly someone could be unable to

ROLLING STONES Produce
The Finest In Live Albums

by Eric Gracber

GET YOUR YA-YA‘S OUTI,
the Rolling Stones (London,
NPS-h)

It was a night to remember.
November 28, 1969. The Stones
were at Madison Square Garden
for the last of three concerts.

At ti jam. that night, we went
up the infinite number of cscala~
tor stairs, thinking of the Blind
Faith fiasco at M.S.G. the pre-
vious JuIV. Clapton, Baker, Grcch,
and Winwood, the super group
whch was supposed to end all
super groups(but only resulted in
its own self-destruction) played
on a horrendous revolving stage
that hid the foursome behind ten
foot high amplifiers for half the
concert. In addition, the sound
systcnt was putrid. We wondered
if even the magic of thc Stones
could conquer the acoustic and
visual problems of an arena built
for hockey, basketball, and box»
ing.

The doubts grow as time passed.
The program slurlcd nearly an
hour late. But as 'l‘crry Itcid came
on to open the show, one thing
became apparent: the amplifi-
cation was not to be a problem.
The Stones had the foresight to
bring lheir own sound system, and
the music was crisp and clear. The
Stones also sacrificed revenues for
-l,tlt)l) seals so that the stage could
be placed on one side of the arena
and everyone could see well.

And, good omen! Even though
our seats were in the last row of
the upper stratosphere, We looked
down on the stage.

’l‘i-rry Reid proved to be just a
distraction, like a mosquito buzz»
ing around your head as you try
to fall asleep. The music of BB.
King and lkrI and Tina Turner was
more appropriate, producing a
beautiful mood before the grand
entrance of the Stones.

Yes it all comes back after hear-
ing the new, live. Stonon album,
"Got your Ya-Ya's Out!" Looking
through the binoculars and seeing
the Stones behind the stage as
they waited for the crowd to cool
down from the hunt created by

Tina andthc ikcltes; the crowd in
a frenzy as Jagger in his Uncle

'Sam hat lcapt into the air and the

band started their set with a rous-
ing version of “Jumping Jack
Flushl; a 180 pound freckle-faced
teeny boppcr rushing out. of the
front row towards Jagger and the
latter ducking like Joe Namath
under the rush of an opposing
lineman; Jagger on his knees,
slamming his gold studded belt.
ugninsl lhe floor during "Midnight
Rambler" and moaning “Oh don‘t
do thatl”; Mick asking the audience
“Are you enjoying yourself?"
when the answer was self-evident;
Mick telling the audience
“Charlie‘s played well tonight!" as
Watts, the drummer grinned
sheepishly in embarrassment; and
finally the swaying and clapping
of the mob as the Stones played

“Street Fighting Man" and
the feeling that perhaps the revolu-
tion (lid have a chance.

The album has a few faults but
documents well the feeling of that
memorable night. The Stones have
never had a reputation for mixing
their albums Well and this is no
exception. Jagger‘s-voice is occa-
sionally hidden behind the roaring
guitars of Mick Taylor and Keith
Richard, and Bill Wymun‘s bass is
almost non-existent, but well, as a
matter of fact, that's the way it
sounded in concert also. I am
disappointed that the Stones
couldn‘t squeeze in their excellent
versions of “Prodigal Man" and
“Under My 'l‘humb." But these
are only minor foibles of an over-
all nutstcrpicce from one of the
greatest rock bands of our era.

It.
Theatre and Theatre Council.

This British drama centers on
the death of a beautiful young girl
and the reactions of those who
felt they knew her. The small cast
which has brought these
characters to life is as follows:
Ron Abel, Mary Carney, Joseph
Geocco, Henry Kuivila, Richard
Leaming, Gary Maggio, Eric Pop-
pick, Barbara Richards, and Jodi
Wells.

The technical side of the
production has a new twist to a
State University Theatre produc-
tion. It. is entirely student de-
signed. A movublc, free-form,
changeable set has been designed
by William Snydier. The lighting
design has been done by Matt
Murphy. Rae Anne Crandall has
designed and directed the produc-
tion of the costumes. Except for
Dr. Jarka Burian, the entire pro-
duction has been designed, built,
and performed by students.

Tickets for all performances are
now available at the PAC Box
Office between ll a.m. and 4
pm. The admission price is $l.00
for students with SUNYA tax
cards, and $2.00 for all others.
Reservations and further informa-
tion maybe obtained by phoning
4573606 or 457-7535.

afford the jazz concart because
the admission price would be $1

Concert Board: We can’t afford
the money.

Jazz Club: We are only asking
$700 most (if not all) of which
would be returned. Concert Board
spends more than that just for a
back-up group and maintenance
for rock concerts. Concert Board
will use in excess of $60,000 this
year. The comparison between
our $700 and $60,000 is stagger-
mg.

Concert Board: We cannot con-
cern ourselves as much (in terms
of time and money) for such a
small minority as you would like.

Jazz Club: The plan given them
Would have taken little of their
time and money because those
proposing the plan (Jazz Club)
preferred to do the work them-
selves, and the money would be
returned by selling tickets.

Concert Board: There is not
enough time for planning a con-
cert.

Jazz Club: Concert Board has
brought this on themselves as a
result of their stalling techniques.
However, the second weekend in
December was also open and this
was mentioned. This was also re-
jected, but with no reason.

When all arguments were suc-
cessfully put down by Jazz Club
the Concert Board still said no.
Why? In the Words of member
Sue Levey, "We are too tired and
irritable to put on another con-
cert." All Concert Board members
agreed. No jazz concert.

So four people, all incidentally,
who are virtual xerox copies of
one another in their musical taste,
have repressed jazz. Yes, there was
Miles Davis concert handled poo-
rly: lousy publicity, ridiculous
acoustics, absurd offcumpua pri-
ces. None of these self-anointed
experts knows the first thing
about jazz. But instead of making
reparations they told Jazz Club to
wait-this time until next semes‘
tor—thus a continuance of their
lct-them-cat- promises campaign.

So they continue, these four
all-powerful, all-knowing music
gurus, spending nuimmoth sums
of OUR money on who THEY
Want to see. Something must be
done of course, but what?
