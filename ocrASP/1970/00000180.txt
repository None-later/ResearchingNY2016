everything that the present state
of technology would permit them
to do other than go into the
county sewage treatment plant
which is in its final stages of
design and some of the intercep-
tions are under construction.

uer" —— How do you explain this
conflict?

Well, the only thing that I can
say is that the State Health Dept.
said that they were the second
worst polluter -- if they hadn‘t
done the things that they have
done, then they'd be far and away
the worst. In any event, I don’t
think that's an accurate statement
- I think the Manning Paper
Company in Green Island pro~
duces over half the entire amount
of industrial pollution that goes
into the Hudson River and that of
course is also going to be treated

with Mayor Corning

 

"Evidence has been collected to
the effect that Albany State is just
as bad a polluter of Patroon Creek
as Tobin or anyone else is. Does
your office have any information
as to just how bad the pollution is
from Albany State and, if so,
what is being done to correct this
situation?

No, there again the wastes that
are going from State University
into Patroon Creek are giong in by
gravity. They‘re domestic wastes
from toilets. showers, kitchens,
things like that and, there again,
when the State University was
constructed and these towers were
built, this procedure that was fol-
lowed was recognized and pollut<
ing Patroon Creek and received
the clear understanding that this
was to be done.

I would like to point out one
thing as far as the city is con-
cerned. The city doesn't have any
contron over the type of building
that the state does. So that is
something that is purely and simp-

which I would not have thought
n A was realistic, recognizing that the

long-range plans at that time were
very definitely to have municipal
treatment of all sewage wastes.

And yet, it could be said that
those involved in the construction
of the university were guilty to
some extent of creating a situa-
tion of temporary pollution and
possible disease?

There's no question of that You
use the word guilty. I do not feel
that is perhaps the word l would
use. I think we recognize that it
was a problem.

They also recognize that the
treatment of these wastes was was
definitely in the wind that this
was a judgment made from an
economic point of view and
would have been very expensive
to treat these wastes properly.

And the slate has biven indica-
tion that it will pay those fees?

They haven't been asked yet—
but I'm quite sure they will.

In March, lllliti, a ri-porl preparcd by Malcolm
l’irnil- l‘il'lﬂlnl‘l'l‘s cutilli-d “Albany County Compre-
hensive Scwugc Study" suggested lhal. il would be
morc i-conomic for the polluli-rs in this arca to band
“mono-r “ml combat thc pollution as a group. They
adopted lliis as policy.

“Since lbcy havc choscn group action and are
making progrcss," said Wcist, “no penalty action has
i‘lt‘t'll taken." He said that if cases of loot-dragging
occur, prosccutions will take place either throuin
lbc Health Department or the Attorney General‘s
office.

So, even though the polluters (including Albany
State) are technically still at fault and the dumping
of scwagc and waste continues unabated all parties
conccmcd are content to wait for the completion of
Albany County's new waste treatment facilities.
Bids went out for construction late last week.

"ll. appears nothing is being donc...but this is not
so,"said Thomas J. Quinn, director of Environ-
mental Health Services for the Albany County
Health Department. “Construction will start in a
couplc ol' montl. the municipalities and states
have low alternatives.
