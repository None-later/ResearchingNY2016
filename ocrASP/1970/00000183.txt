Albany State closed out their
initial grid season Saturday with a
61-8 loss to Hudson Valley Com-
munity College. Although things
didn’t work out too well for the
Danes this game, their season was
lfar from the disaster many people
predicted it would be and hope
‘runs high for the future of foot-
ball here at State.

Losing to Hudson VAlley was
certainly no disgrace. Just last
week the powerful Vikings barely
lost to the number two junior
college team in the nation, Grand
Rapids, Mich. Contrary to popular
balief, ll school’s size has no rela-
tion with the strength of its athle-
l-ic program. Thus the Danes, with
no recruitment and five starters
(with high school experience) who
hadn't played football in three
years were at a distinct (lis-
advantage.

The Statesmen (lid come into
the game with an excellent mental
attitude. They drove the ball

seventy yards in ten plays with
quarterback Rick Petty carrying it
in for the score early in the first
period. But on that driva halfback
Bernie Boggs received a head in-
jury which required stitches and
kept him from finishing the game.
With Boggs' departure went 90%
of Albany’s offense. Later in the
second quarter a safety and an
interference penalty gave
H.V.C.C. scores. The second half
contained many State errors and
developed into a route. However
the Albany players never quit and
kept fighting right up to the
whistle.

Coach Ford, while obviously not
pleased with the score, still felt
that Albany's showing wasn't that
bad for a new team. Bogg’s injury
and a few mistakes shifted the
momentum to H.V.C.C. and al-
lowed thcm to make ll rout of the
second half. Conch Ford cited end
Butch McGllerty, trickle Steve
Finn, and linebacker Nick Conte
for playing fine defensive games.
0n offense quarterback Rick
Petty showed a lot of poise in his

first start.

Looking back on the season
Coach Ford said, “We made up
our mind right at the beginning
not to measure the year’s success
or failure in terms of games won,
but rather on team growth in
unity, skill, and spirit. From this
standpoint I feel it was a highly
successful season. I think we have
a fine nucleus for next year’s
team." He further noted that
some of this year's players have
shown fine promise for the future.
Among this group are defensive
backs John Johnson and Randy
Farnsworth, defensive tackles Bob
Downey and Finn, and linebacker
Conte. On offense the men to
watch for are guard Pete Moorc,
ends Ed-Perka-and Ernie Thomas,
halfbacks Cleve Little and Boggs.
and quarterback Petty.

Some things are bound to hold a
first year team back in their pro-
gress. Considerable time must be
taken finding the right spots for
each player. Albany in particular
was hampered by the lack of all
important pro-season practice.
The coaching staff merited ﬁne
praise from Coach Ford, but he
noted that they could have done
an even better job if some of the
assistants were on a fuiltime basis.
All these factors slowed the Danes
down but despite them a good
football program was started.

It‘s hard to say how far the team
will go from this beginning with 11
rough eight game schedule slated
for next year. A lot of the answer
will depend on administration
policy concerning recruitment,
admissions, hiring of a fulltime
staff etc. The important elements
of coach and team enthusiasm are
there and these lend State fans to
be optimistic. As the old Dodger
fans used to say, “Wait till next
year."

Wrestlers Strong, Have
Depth, Experience

The picture looks quite a bit
brighter this year for the varsity
wristling team than it did at the
same time last season. With six
returning lettermen and all the
weight classifications manned at
this time, Coach Joe Garcia pre-
dicts a successful year.

The grapplers will be led by
tri-captains Jeff Albrecht, Phil
Mims and Jim Nightingale. “They
have done a very fine job thus far
in pulling the squad together and
building morale," stated Garcia’

Albrecht will wrestle in the 1:12
lb. class with Nightingale shifting
between 150 lb. and 158 lb. The
latter will be hard pressed for a
starting berth by freshman Cliff
Wess, who Garcia says is very
smooth and “knows all the

moves." Wess will also pressure
Mims for the 158 lb. assignment
but Phil is also capable of
wrestling at 167 lbs.

Lettermen Al Mercer, Tim
Coons and Herman Hilliard will go
at the 177 1b., 190 lb. and heavy-
weight classes, respectively.
Hilliard loat only one dual match
all of last year. Two men who
were out last season, Kevin Roach
(150 1b.) and Curt Whitton
(heavyweight), should be very
strong competitors. Tom Hull, ii
freshman who wrestled :1 years at
Albany Academy will man the
118 lb. class with Rex Carey
(Morrisville CC.) or Johnny Lutz
(Guilderland) wrestling at 126 lbs.
Larry Mims, Phil's brother and a
freshman might well start at 134

Hoopsters Impressive

In Brock. Scrimmage

The Great Dane varsity basket—
ball team scrimmaged a very
tough Brockport State quintet on
Saturday and came away with a
74-67 victory.

Although State did not play
exceptionally well, they did 21 very
creditable job in light of the fact.
that Brockport finished second in
last year's NCAA small college
eastern regional tournament.

According to Coach Doc Stillers,
the team run very well but had
trouble culminating the fast
breaks by scoring. “Our ball
handling was not up to par and we
missed too many good scoring
opportunities.

Suuers will not, at this point,
commit himself as to probable
starters this year. One might pre-
sume that they will be the four
returning starters from last season,
co-captains Jack Jordan and Allin
Reid, and seniors Jim Mllsterson
llnd Steve Shcchan, pills either

sophomore DAVe Wclchons or
junior transfer John Quattrochi.
Bob Rossi, also ll junior transfer
could start and will definitely see
a great deal of action against the
zone defense since he is, according
to Sauers, the squads‘s best out-
side shooter.

Transfer Stch Juss and sopho~
more Werner Kolln will give
Sheehan a strong back-up in the
middle.

Tomorrow, the Danes visit
American international College in
Massachusetts. The latter are one
of the strongest small colleges ill
the nation. A good showng to-
morrow would be further proof
that this year's squad can luch a
very successful season.
