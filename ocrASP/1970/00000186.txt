New Band Director
Sees Changes Ahead

Wednesday and Saturday nights
mark the first concerts performed
by the University Concert Band
under the baton of Mr. Charles
Boito, their new director. We in-
terviewed Mr. Hello on Thursday,
and the following is the text of
that conversation.

This year marks the first time
that the Concert Band and the
Orchestra have had separate direc-
tors. However, this will allow
more time for each group to be
able to experiment and expand,
This is especially true with the
Band, which is now increasing its
rcpctoire and adding new dimen-
sions to its selections.

Beginning with these first two
concerts, the band has included
woodwind chamber music. Straus‘
Opus [7, Serenade for Winds, is
the ﬁrst of these. and it involves
the use of some thirteen instru-
ments. The piece was so well
received as to encourage Mr. Boito
to include similar pieces in futurc
concerts.

One of the advantages of such a.
piece is that it utilises the talcnu
of thirteen students, each one of
whom must carry an entire sec.
tion by himself. Such selections
are showeuses for the talents of
the more advanced music stu-
dents.

Selections during the program
will include works by Strauss,

“Untitled.” u woodcut by Marjory Koster, is among the works now

being exhibited in the Art Gallery.

Art Gallery Has New
Readers Theater Presents Moore

by Erla Zwingle

The exhibition which opened
Tuesday night in the University
Art Gallery is a happy combina-
tion of two artists whose works
actually have little in common.
Prints by Marjory Kostcr and
paintings by Show Nagano both
have immediate and sensual im-
pact, but strongly contrast in sev-
eral ways.

Color is the strongest common
quality, yct color is ii tricky sub-
ject to discuss in art, for in doing
so one may sound either tremen-
doust sophisticated or utterly

naive. The color in Koster's prints
is vibrant and uncomplicated, but
the style of her designs varies
sharply between the "verbal"
group, which could be called word
collages, and the group composed
of strong, simple shapes. Her liter-
ary gimmick prints attempt to
substitute words as elements of
design in themselves, but she
thereby fails to convey any moun-
ing whatsoever, visqu or verbal,
The esthetic sense is left
scrambling for a foothold which
simply isn't there amid the clut-
ter. Her simpler prints, however,

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

A Scent Of Flowers at PAC
A SUN YA Theater Triumph

by Beth Knapke

Although “A Scent. of Flowers“
by John Saundeis is scheduled for
November 18-22, I previewed it.
on Monday, November 17.

It is exciting to watch excellent
performers; Mary Carney as Zoe
and Henry Kuivillii us Uncle Edgar
are well worth seeing. Miss Carney
is talented, and every year she
improves with experience. She can
perform both comedy and tragedy
extremely well. In this tragedy of
a young girl who has an affair
with her professor, she plays the
role of a devout Catholic who
suffers from extreme guilt.

Each act is well planned, begin-
ning with a coffin scene where
Zoe and her step—brother, God-
frey, meet to explain the past.

Exhibit -

seem to attempt less and thereby
accomplish more.

Shozo Nagano's works are called
paintings, but he works both on
and with the canvas, He is inter-
preting a technique known also to
primitive artists of the Pacific who
create masks by stretching fibers
over frames, although he devel-
oped his method unaware of this
similarity. Here he has exag-
gerated the threwdimensiunal
character of his shaped canvases
through careful gradations of
color at transition points, and all
his pieces convoy a sensc of pre-
cision and craftsmanship which
arc in themselves a delight, llis
i-arlicr penchant for drawing in
tho classic stylc of liigrcs can be
seen in his unique inlcrprclalion
of surl'ncc modelling, bolli pliysi~
cal and visual. This is an exciting
and unusual ('Xliihilion.

Marianne Moore

A lIi-udcrs 'l‘hcnlro production
of Poetry by Marianne Moore will
IH‘ prcscnlcd Hatui‘dny, Novvnilicr
ill, al 7:30 p.m. in thc rccilal hall
of llic Performing Arts (Icnlcr.
Admission is frcc.

Marianne Moore, now eighty-
l.liri-c, is one of lhc country‘s
foi'cniosl pools. She has been the
recipient of the National Book
Award for Poetry and the Pulitn-r
Prize. The form of Iicr poems is
strict and original, depending on
the syllabic length of lines rather
llinn on the number of stresses.
lli-r vision is also unique. She
regards minuti- events, such as ii
cul sleeping and then dashing
about, and then draws conclusions
about the csscncv of life. At
times, her vision becomes quite
fantastic and humorous.

The production will open with
Marianne Moore's most famous
poem, "Poetry," which begins
with the line, "I, too, dislike it..."

Zoe’s father married Godfrey’s
mother bringing Zoe into a very
unusual family. Her stepmother iii
stern and cold, her stepbrother is
friendly but disagreeing, her
father has turned oblivious to her
life, and her Uncle Edgar is in
charge of his mother, a denfmute.
All seem lost, unhappy people
except for Zoe, who had been
sent to ii convent school for girls.
Yet because she takes God and
religion seriously, she suffers for ii
sin she thinks beautiful and quite
normal. After disclosing the secret
of her affair with a married pro-
fessor to ii close friend, the news
ﬁnds its way to Zoe's mother.
Eventually her family is informed.
Yet most of them, including her
father, choose to ignore it, still
thinking of her as their little girl;
Uncle Edgar tells her fairy tales to
forget. Unfortunately her guilt
does not disappear even after con-
fession, and she is tormented by
the fact of never seeing her lover
again.

As her brother says “Confession
is like negating whatever linp-
pcned; it makes you forget what-
ever beauty therc was and dc.
nounces the ecstasy as filth."
Eventually she is so overcomme
by the thought of sinning that she
brands her arm with a cross to

«' , PAGES ,

show her love for God. That,
however, does not erase the long-
ing for happiness with the profes-
sor, and she commits suicide by
taking sleeping pills. It seems to
be the only relief for a religious
girl who has nowhere to turn for
help. After all of her attempts to
go to heaven it is ironical that she
rests in hell.

See Barbara Richards as Agnes,
the unloving but “understanding”
stepmother whose face never loses
its harsh and cold look. Her
reasoning, “grow up fast and face
reality" is plausible, but there is
no affection behind it.

Ron Abel fits the pai't. of David,
Zoe's father. He is caring, yet
unsure of how to express his
concern.

Scrivens (Eric Poppick) plays
the undertaker as a businessman
used to his trade; his movements
and eye contact (future theater
majors) are worth observing, and
his articulation is so noticeable
that you would be tempted to
speak the lines with him. Mathew
Murphy and Rue Anne Crnndall
have ii showcase for their talents
as lighting and costume designers.

I recommend that. you buy your
tickets early as there is a limited
number of seats.
