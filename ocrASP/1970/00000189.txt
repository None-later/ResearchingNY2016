deﬁnitely ﬁlled. Co-captaine JaCk
Jordan, starting for the third rea-
son in a row, and Al Reid, will
man the forward positions. The
remaining spots are open, but. the
guess here is that. Jordan and Reid
will be joined by seniors Jim
Masterson and Steve Sheehan and
junior John Quattrochi. Unlike
the past. two seasons in which the
Great Danes relied mostly on the
starting ﬁve, Sauers says he will
play about eight men equally.
This added bench strength will be
a valuable asset. throughout the
season. Sauers has been partic-
ularly pleased with the improve-
ment of his sophomores. Look for
6-4 Werner Kolln to see action at.
center and at. forward, while Dave
Welchons will swing between for-
ward and guard.

As in previous seasons, Albany
will be competing against schools
offering athletic scholarships. Of
course Albany, being a state
school, offers no athletic scholar-
ships. Siiuers does try to recruit.
good players for the school, pru-
vidotl they meet the academic

requirements of the school. The
recruiting cannot be done on a
large scale because funds are
limited and both Sauers and fresh-
man coach Bob Lewis have teach-
ing responsibilities. Sauers relies
on recommendations from alumni
in great deal. He tries to see as
many players as possible through-
out the staie,however, and if he
can attract a share of good players
from the Albany area, he is satis-
ﬁed.

TI. is improbable that. there will
be it radical departure from the
present situation. Albany State
has the facilities, but the state is
not. likely to approve the granting
of athletic scholarships. Suuers is
not. unhappy with the players he
has, however. He is very proud
that his squads can compete with
tennis stocked with players on
athletic scholarships. His players
are physically in shape and Sauers
feels that his team can stay with
the competition it faces as long as
the opponent does not have two
or three good big men. ‘

The First Year

 

 

 

by Dave Fink

Albany State has seen its ﬁrst year of club football end. The team
ﬁnished the season witha 2-4 won-lost record.

If one kept track of the team's progress beginning with the
organizational meeting one night last spring until last Saturday's loss
to Hudson Vally, he would be well aware that the two wins posted by
Coach Robert. Ford's squad were two more than anyone had a right to
expect on the first. day of practice. There are many reason for this.

Firstly, as any coach at this University will regrettably admit, it is
frighteningly close to impossible to get good athletes to attend State.
Academic requirements are such that. men gaining admission here will
also probably be accepted at. an Ivy League institution or a school
which offers a similarly ﬁne scholastic program. The only chance that
a SUNY coach has to get. this man is if the other schoolfs) do not give
scholarships, In a good many instances, this is not theggse.

Secondly, being given a position only last. spring, (birch Ford had
little if any time to speak to proapectiva applicants in order to interest
them in the school.

Thus, thirdly, Dr. Ford was left. to work with men already enrolled
at the University who had either never played football before or who
had not. played for two or three years. He was blessed,however, with
what he calls "probably the most spirited and greatest bunch of kids"
he has ever worked with.

Lastly, Coach Ford had no full time associates. The assistant coaches
were either attending graduate school iii. the University or holding
outside jobs. This meant that the entire workings of the team were
coordinated between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. every day with more
than half of this time taken up by practice.

In short, Coach Ford and his assistants, Dennis Moran, Steve
Sarnoff,Nick Kurtulis, Phil Grady, Paul Stumbuch, Don Dello Siriiio
and Roy Murphy molded a group of prospective football players into
a football team. Hurt. by injuries and hick of expeience, meeting teams
with a year or two hetidsiurf. in football, the Dane gridders more than
held their own on the ﬁeld. With it few new faces and a whole lot.
more experience, nexi. year's football picture looks very bright.
