World News

The United Nations pulsed a United States resolution which
called for the humane trenlrnent of prisoners of war and provided
for the periodic inspection of prisoner-ofmr camps. The ,esolu,
tion was speciﬁcally drawn to protect American soldiers in North
Vietnam, although no particular mention of Hanoi was in [he
resolution.

Dave Bruce, the chief American negotiator at the Paris peace
talks, denounced what he called Hanoi's “shameful altllude"
toward its prisoners of war. He termed the Paris peace ulks a
sham, because the North Vietnamese, be hand. have refused m
negotiate in good faith. The talks, Bruce said. were nuihmg more
than “a propaganda ﬁeld day" for the Commumiu,

Israel has announced that an Egyptian mow: launch was sunk
last weekend, killing four Egyptian Crewmen. Israeli auihomles
claimed that the vessel had engaged in espionage and nighg‘n
smuggling.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

by Al Seniu

Faced with an acute manpower
shortage and in an effort to corn-
bat the spiraling crime rule that
has seen the campus plagued by
car robberies, dorm thefts, and
even urmed holdups, SUNYA po-
lice nrrested a number of suspects
within the pusl. week.

The first nrresls occurred lust
Saturdny night when u patrolman
observed in Chevrolet sedan cruis-
ing in the Dutch Quud parking lot
at 1:00 am. with its lights cx-
Linguished. The officer had no-
ticed the cur on two previous
occusiuns and so decided Lo seurch
it. His work yielded him a smull
quantity of marijuana, resin, 11
hash pipe, and rolling paper. The
four occupants of-llie cur-1111 high
school students and all 17 yeurs
old~were charged with possession
of dangerous drugs. Additionally,
one was charged with loitering.

In the second instance, events
were much more complicated.
Osic Bell, a SUNYA studenl, was
arrested on November 20 and
charged with criminal trespass and
puffy larceny arising from am inci-
dent of burglary on campus. He
was relenst on bull and his case
adjourned until last Mondny.

However, in the interim, five
students of Anthony Hall return-
ing from lunch one afternoon
entered their suite to find two
other students sitting on their
beds. When questioned, the two
claimed they were waiting to ne-
gotiate u marijunmi purchase with
the sixth member of the suite and
gave their names us "Willie" and
"Joe." When the missing room-
mntc returned Inter, heclaimed to
have no knowledge of the drug
deal or the lwo students. Menn-
\vhile, one of the members of the

tampered with. No articles were
missing. Security was notiﬁed and
investigator John Henighan noted
that there was a similarin with
other cases that he was Investi-
gating.

Last week, two suspects were
arrested and charged with criminal
trespass. One was identiﬁed as
Harold Nelson. The other was

by Aralynn Abare

Peter Cousins, instruclor in Eng-
lish, has been denied tenure here,

ding concern nl. Presidenl Bone

The concern over security mcl
with Lhe admission that virtually
nothing additional has been done
[his semeslcr with the problem of
people breaking into cars. The
only hopeful note was that u
carful of people, who were allege-
dly attempting to vandalize curs
over the Thanksgiving vucnliun
was apprehended. The possibility
of rclocking or rckeying the entire
university was seriously discussed
because of the large number of
complaints about lost and sliilvn
master keys, It was also nqu
that the number of incidents
(thefts, bomb scam-s, etc.) has
significantly increased this your.

President Bonuzul expressed
sympathy for flu- Sllldl‘llls closed

Continuing Appointments did not.
approve the recommendation and
President Benezet, who has ﬁnal
say, upheld the Council‘s decision.

I‘I assume it's because I have no
PhD.," explnins Cousins, who was
given no definite explanation for
the tenure dcniul. He has comple-
ll‘d ull but three doctoral courses
and purt of his dissertution, a
collection of short stories.

“There is an idea, a principle
involved," he suys. "There appears
to be u drift in the university from
:1 teacher to u researcher emphasis.
It mixes in question as to what the
univcrsily is for. A PhD esposes
one to more knowledge, but there
are people in the department who
luch been given tenure without a
PhD."

Cousins came here in 1965 from
Western Illinois University where
he taught for three years. He
currently teaches General Survey
of English Literature, the Short
Story, nnd Critical Writing.

Omler faculty in the English
department being considered for
lenure include Myron Taylor,
Divu Duims, George Hastings and
Helen Carlson.
