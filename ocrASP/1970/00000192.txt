Harry Noon 81 Night Leads

University Theater Events

“Harry, Noon and Night," writ-
ten by Ronald Ribman and direct-
ed by Albert Weiner, will be the
entry of State University of New
York at Albany for the American
College Theatre Festival next
spring in Washington DC.

The play will open in the Studio
Theatre of the Performing Arts
Center Wednesday, Dec. 9, at
8:th p.m. and continue the re-
maindcr of the week. Reserved
scat tickets are $2 or $1 with
student tax card. Preview perfor-
manccs will be held Monday and
Tuesday, Dec. 7 and 8, 211.8230 for
a limited general admission audi-
ence at $1 and $0.50 with tax
card.

The competition aspect of the
production is an added challenge
for the technical designers,
Mildred Koob, costumes,
Robert Donnelly, scenic design
and Jerome Hanley, lighting, be-
cause the festival rules place cer-
tain limitations upon them. The
entire company with costumes
and set must be able to travel to
the regional contest, and perhaps
to the final Washington competi-
tion, The John F. Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts and the
Smithsonian Institution will be
hosting the festival, with Ameri-
can Airlines, in Washington.

One hundred sixty fch plays
from campuses across thccountry
are entered. The competition is
presented by lhc American Educa-
tional 'l‘hcatrc Association and the
Amci'ii'an National Theatre and
Academy and sponsoi'cd by Amer-
ican Airliiii-s.

The Sound of Gold  Get Yer Yu-Yu’s Out A

by Bob Rosenblum

The following albums either are
currently or in the near future will
be on sale at bargain prices in area
department stores and discount
stores. I will try to present such
reviews periodically in an attempt
to reacquaint readers with older
recordings.

Moody
Blues

A Question of Balance,
The Moody Iilucs (Threshold, Tits
3)

Well, 1 expected more, but I
expected a lot. If you're familiar
with the Moody Blues, you‘re
aware that their music can be
breathtakingly beautiful. DAYS
OF FUTURE PASSED was damn
good. IN SEARCH OF THE
LOST CHORD was not superb
throughout, but some cuts were
tremendous, ON THE THRESH-
OLD OF A DREAM had only one
good cut on the first side, but the
second side was beautiful. I kept
waiting for their perfect album;
TO OUR CHILDREN’S CHIL-
DREN‘S CHILDREN might have
been it. That was virtually flawless
and absolutely beautiful.

I wondered how they's follow
that album. Their answer is A
QUESTION OF BALANCE and,
while it's by no means a disaster, 1
don‘t think it's a total success
either.

Th1- highlights of thc alhum--not
surprisingly-ﬁre Justin Hayward's
three songs (“Out-soon," "It's Up
to You," "Dawning is the Day")
where the lyrics are up to par with
the music. If you check through
all the albums, you'll see that
while the other Moodies write
sometimes well and sometimes
not so well, Hayward virtually
never flaws; he's got quite a head.
Try playing “It's Up To You"
early some morning when you‘ve
been up all night. It makes every-
thing okay even if it really isn‘t.

The rest of the album falls down
mostly because the lyrics, which,
with the exception of Hayward‘s,
are generally pretty trite. It's
strange, because by the last album
(or before) the Moodies had all
proven themselves to be excellent
songwriters, Yet, this album lyric—
ally comes nowherc near the stan»
dards they set for themselves last
time. “The Balance" is particular-
ly poor: strange, since it appears
that they consider it a major
effort. 1 really (really) hate to put
down the Moody Blues, but this
song comes off sounding like The
Iuhlc rcwrittcn by Rod McKucn.

It's too bad that the lyrics aren't
always up to the music on this
album, but l.l1l' music is often so
hcautiful that you forch the lyric
anyway. This is a must buy al-
bum, despite its faults, if you dig
the Moody Blues. Just don‘t ex-
pect perfection. The Moodics
aruu't perfect, though they some»
times appear to be.

The Rolling Stones’ Beggars
Banquet (Decca LK4955) is not
their best album, but Stones fans
should like it. There seems to be a
thin coating of satire throughout
the album both musically as well
as literarily. There is a good deal
of variety ranging from the sardo-
nic Afro Cuban “Sympathy for
the Devil", to the oriental inspired
“Factory Girl" the country and
westernish "Dear Doctor," the
hard rock “Parachute Woman"
the country blues of “Prodigal
Son” and the protest of “Salt of
the Earth."

The Soft Machine (Command
CPLP 4500) is the name of an
excellent group and their album
that deserves wider recognition.
Their songs iire consistently ima-
ginative and fresh thanks chiefly
to Kevin Ayers. The blend of acid
rock, jazz and modern European
“serious” music provides a re«
warding and lasting listening expe-
rience.

Swch Thursday (Tetragra-
mmaton T—112) is art unpreten-
tious, relaxing album in the folk
rock idiom. Jon Mark is an unex-
ccptional vocalist, but he seems to
feel what he sings. The musical
backing is never offensiVe always
soft. Woodwinds, organ, guitar
and drums are used with a good
deal of restraint, but with little
variation. On the whole it is satis-
fying, but not moving.

Deep Purple (’l‘etragrammaton
T-119) by Deep Pruple is an ad-
venturous reach for ccclecticicism,
My favorite tracks: “Chasing Sha-
dows" which spotlights a flashy
guitar solo, a soulful organ and
echo chamber voices wrapped in a
heated rhythmic context making
use of various pnrctission instru-
ments. Donovan's “Liliane” is
sung with feeling and contains a
swinging, but out of place solo on
organ.

“Fault line” is the most experi-
mental track on the album wing
various electronic affects in a
dirge'likc manner which suddenly
jumps to a sound salad bridge
giving birth to surly guitar
phrases. The vocal seems vaguely
similar to "Summertime."

“April” the longest and most
intriguing selection, is a combina-
tion of rock and classical music.

J Music

The Music Department of the
State University of New York at
Albany will present its Annual
Choral Festival in the Main Thea-
ter of the Performing Arts Center
at 8:110 p.m. on the evenings of
Dec. 10th and 11th. Admission is
free and the public is cordially
invited.

A most unusual and exciting
contemporary work by Norman
Dcllo Joio, a young American
composer, will be performed by a
choru: of more than 250 voices
from singers of the Mixed chorus-
es, the Univorsity Singers, and the

I am holding in my hand the
cover to one of the ﬁnest rock
album ever made. Lester Bangs,
in Rolling Stone, calls it the
Stones' best album and “the best
rock concert ever put on record.”

The album opens with a collage
of MC introductions from the
Stones U.S. tour last year. One
MC screams: “The Greatest. Rock
and Roll Band in the World—the
Rolling Stonesl!" and enough ex-
citement is generated in this intro
to make you believe that that MC
just might know what he‘s talking
about.

Then suddenly all you hear (or
want to hear) is the Rolling
Stones, loud and beautiful. Jagger
begins with a solid version of
“Jumpin' Jack‘Flash." Turn it up
loud; it‘s really far out. When it
ends, all the little girls are in a
fervor and Mick is teasing: “Uh oh
1 think I bust a button on my
trousers....you don't want my
trousers to fall down, now do
ya?" Of course, all the girls
scream “yes"—-they do, and the
mean it. Think of the sociological
implications (I’m serious). Think
of mothers sitting home while
their fourteen year old daughters
are at a concert screaming for
some cat's trousers to fall.

This album is rock and roll, and
that means losts of sex power.
And that‘s always meant danger
to Middle America, ever since
1956 when Elvis Presley iii an
appearance on Ed Sullivan, was
photographed from the waist up
only (The Stones had trouble
with Sullivan, too; they had to
change “Let‘s Spend the Night
Together" to “Lets's Spend Some
Time Together" for 01‘ Ed.)

The album moves right into
Chuck Berry's “Carol”. And by
now there's no mistake: this is
Rock and Roll, possibly by the
fincsRock and Roll band ever.

The “Stray Cat Blues" which, if
you know the song, relates right
back to the trousers thing. That‘s
followed by "Love In Vain,"
which, like much of the album,
compares favorably to previous
“polished” studio cuts. Because
this album is more free, more
raunchy, more alive than studio
material, it bears up much better
on repeated listenings. The first

Statesman. The work, “A Psalm
of David" is based on a cantus
firmus by Josquin des Prcz in a
setting of thc Psalm (No. 50 in the

Catholic numbering, 51 in the
Protestant and Jewish number-
ing.)

Norman Dello Joio, the compos-
er, represents a phenomenon
uniquer characteristic of our cul-
tural life: a ﬁrst-generation Amer
ican who assimilates the heritage
of his fatherland (Italy) and more
indigenous elements such as lead-
ing his own jazz band and study-
ing at the Juilliard School as well
as working with Hindemith.

side ends with “Midnight Ram-
bler" (8:32). Here, Jagger starts
singing before the band is even
ready, he's that into it. Side One
is kind of long—over twenty
three minutes—and you‘ll dig
every second.

Side Two begins with an abso-
lutely fantastic beautiful excellent
far out “Sympathy for the Devil."
“Live With Me" is next. Jagger’s
invitation is somewhere between
the sexual message of “Let's
Spend the Night Together" and
the insult of “Under My Thumb."
Again, beautifully done: tight, but

still spontaneous. “Little
Queenie" repays more of the debt
to Chuck Berry. Then “Honky
Tonk Women" (third version on
record, not counting the Bootleg
album). “Street Fighting Man"
ends Side Two, which is just short
of twenty minutes.

Don’t get this album if the
landlord lives downstairs and you
have to keep quiet (unless you
have headphones). Otherwise, get
the money together, get the re-
cord, get spaced out of your head
and experience true rock and roll
as it should be done. I see a big
future for this band!
