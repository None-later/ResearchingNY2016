Tenure:

Who Does it

by Vicki Zeldln
News Editor

In an age when the entire educa-
tional structure is being quels
tioned and consequently changed
it seem odd that the system of
tenure has been questioned but
not consequently changed.

On this campus alone we have
seen the abolition of university-
wide requirements and the institu-
tion of a total pass-fail grading
system. We have also seen contro-
versies over teacher tenure and
promotion decisions: Waterman
and Rhoads (Psy.), Tucker (His),
Wagner (EPA), Cadbury (Phi.)
and Cousins (Eng. ).

What was made apparent in
these controversies was the reali-
zation that "a PhD does not a
teacher make,” and the “publish
or perish" doctrine of the univer-
sities seemed an invalid criterion
for determining a teacher's ability
as a teacher. The cry last year was
for more student involvement in
tenure decisions, and as Wiishaw,
a writer for New York State Edu—
cation, has said, “The education
of students is the end product of
our planning efforts, so why
shouldn’t they have some voice in
their own learning?"

The issue of student involve-

primary basis for this discussion.
The point is that the requirements
have been abolished and grades
have been abolished, but the ten-
ure system has not, Many admini-
strators and supervisors contend
that the tenure system provides a
refuge for those who would en-
gage in a charade to perpetuate
mediocrity (N.Y.S. Ed..-Galish).
The goal of the university is to
instruct and stimulate. The net
effect of the tenure system seems,
however, to have negated the pos-
sibility of reaching this goal. Al‘
though the majority of teachers
remain innovative and dedicated
after acquiring tenure there is still
a significant minority who sud-
denly relax (Journal of Sec. Ed.-
Stone). It was reported in News-
day that two school superin-
tendents in Nassau County have
suggested changes are needed in
the tenure laws to rid schools of

tional rigor mortis." it is time for

They are right, but after three or
five or seven years should a teach-
er, who may teach for twanty or
thirty or forty years, feel so ter-
ribly secure? Security unfortu-
nately often leads to compla-
cency.

Tenure does, however, afford
some beneﬁts. It does allow aca-
demic freedom without fear.
However, there would be no fear
if the teacher were rated by his
teaching associates and his stu-
dents. The only person who
would have to fear would be the
poor or incompetent teacher, and
isn’t that the whole point? Ad-
ministrators and supervisors who
usually do not set foot in a
classroom cannot and should not be
the final judge. Student-teacher
ratings mean quality control. A
rating system that brought its
members under scrutiny every
“x” number of years rather than
once means consistently good
quality. When one rcapplies for a
drivers license every three years
one must have his eyes checked
each time. Shouldn’t it follow
then that a teacher, who in a sense
is the “eyes” for students, should
also be continuously checked?

If General Electric
can build an electrrc tractor;
why can’t they burld an
electrrc car?

Still, one mrght expect EleC-Trak
to be the forerunner of a pollution-
free automobile. Perhaps it is. But
there are many crucial problems left

Students, faculty, and adminis-
trators in the School of Education
initiated a series of revisions this
past week which heralded a period
of transition for next semester.

Briefly by way of background,
the School of Education (SOE)
functions as a sort of “service
facility" to the College of Arts
and Sciences, handling student-
teaching assignments and prescrib-
ing a standard set of courses (to-
talling 18 credits) which students
enrolled in the Teaching Program
must pass in order to become
certified teachers upon gradua-
tion. SOE‘s ten departments also

offer an excellent series of grad-
uate programs, some of which are
ranked among the best in the
nation.

Deficienceis in the present set-
up of the School of Ed are mainly
in the undergraduate area: SOE
does not have its own undergrad-
uate advisement system; all Ed-
ucation courses are predetermined
and required, and it is, in fact,
illegal for SOE faculty to advise
students on course registration.
SOE also has no separate admis-
sions policy, i.e., no formal intro-
duction into the Teaching Pro~
gram, and no screening of appli-
cants. Finally, undergraduate
courses are the responsibility of
six SOE departments, and suffer
from the fact that most Ed de-
partments are geared toward grad-
uate programs. A national accredi-
tation corrncil has criticized
Albany's education program for
its lack of facilities on the under-
graduate level.

By this time it large number of
Education faculty members and
administrators have already set
forth proposals, both written and
Verbal, for correcting these defi-
ciencies; which proposals are most
feasible is still a matter of opin-
ion. Dr. Morris Berger of the
Department of Foundations re-
commends making all Education
courses elective; Dr. James
Cochrrme of the Department of
instruction recommends it five-
yerrr 'i‘crrclring Program with joint
advisement from SOE and the
various subject disciplines (Eng-
lish, Math, Science, etc. ); some
professors have suggested the for-
mation of it separate department.
for undergraduate studies in the
School of Ed. These rrre but sam-
ples of the topics of discussion at
the meetings held this past week.

Of immediate importance, the
'i'encher Education Committee of
SOE held the first of two open
hearings on the Burger proposal
lust Mondrry. 'i‘wo undergraduates,
two graduate students, and about.
ten professors attended the meet-
ing, which covered more items
than can be related here. Tire final
hearing on the proposal will be
held this coming Monday, Decem—

Danes Lose Opener To Williams 81-76

Albany State's basketball opener
Tuesday night was spoiled by
Williams College as the visiting
Ephmen defeated the Danes
81-76. After trailing viii-32 at half»
time, Williams blew Albany off
the court by outscoring State
‘1933 in the second half, in (fee
ferrting the Danes Williams nveng»
ed tr one-point overtime loss to
Albany in last year's opener, when
Alan Reid hit two jump shots in
the closing seconds to provide the
margin of victory.

State forged into the lead in the
first half behind il balanced scor»
ing attack and alert defensive play
which caused numerous turnovers,
Albany‘s mrrn-to-man defense was
most effective midway through
the first half when Williams was
held scoreless for nearly 3% min-
utes. Unfortunately for the Danes,
starters Al Reid, Jim Mrrstcrsun,
and Steve Slrcehrrn rill picked

three personal fouls in the ﬁrst
half. limiting their playing time
and forcing Coach Dr. Richard
Sauers to go to his bench more
often than hr- would have liked.
iiilWl‘Vt‘l‘, the Danes still went into
the locker room at intermission
with rrn eleven point lead.

The second half for Albany was
a nightmare. Reid, Mnslcl‘son, and
Sireehrrn each picked up their
fourth forrl early in the half.
Without Sheehrm and Reid, the
Danes only managed eleven re-
bounds in the second half as
Williams dominated the boards at
both ends of the court. The
Ephmen knotted the score at 58
with a little less than ten minutes
remaining in the game and were
never headed. A key factor for
Williams in their second Irrrll'spurt
was their ability to capitalize art
the free throw line. Beneﬁting
from numerous one-arrrdvone siturr~

tions, the Ephmcn outscored
Albany 2342 at the charity
stripe. Lending scorers for

Williams Were Drrve Creerr with 211
points and Vern Manley with
eighteen. Albany, which had six
men in double figures was priced
by Jack Jordan with fourteen

points.

Friday night, Albany meets
Stonybrook on Long island in
what promises to be a difficult
test for the Danes. Stonybrook
qualified for the NCAA college
division tournrrment last season
and is regarded as one of State's

tougher opponents. After that the
Danes will he on the mad againut
