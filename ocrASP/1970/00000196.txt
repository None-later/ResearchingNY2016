Editorial Comment

SOE in Transition

The School of Education at Albany State has for some time
'been a sort of veneer on the University, getting attention mainly
as a sluice for tunnelling out undergraduates who want to avoid
their subject disciplines and get quick jobs as teachers.
Undergraduates seriously interested in becoming good teachers
have been faced with a set of required courses stagnant from years
of neglect.

Right now, the School of Ed is moving in the direction of
signiﬁcant structural change, but it is moving slowly and is not
quite sure of the direction it's going in. The changes would
respond to the loud but unorganized student criticism of last
semester, to several long-standing complaints from individual
professors in SOE and to the general ancient malaise students have
suffered in education courses, since we ceased being a small
teacher’s college.

Changes are slow and haphazard for a number of reasons.
Criticism may be aimed at Education professors for courses which
are dull and seem to lack substance; at the SOE administration for
not responding to student discontent sooner; at the University
Administration for giving SOE no powers of advisement or any
other status among the rest of the University schools and colleges;
at the State of New York for an education budget which
encourages the funding of graduate departmean at the expense of
undergraduate courses,

The ﬁrst important step toward changing the situation at
Albany Was initiated last spring by the Dean of the School of Ed,
Randolph Gardner; he created a Student Advisory Council and
provided for funds and a graduate-student organizer to keep it
going. This semester several professors, notably Dr, Berger of the
Foundations Department and Dr. Cochrane of English Education,
have outlined plans which vary from the unrealistic to the
ingenious and quite practical. And President Benezet has
instituted a Task Force on Deucation to investigate administrative
problems.

But most criticism should be directed at a large, potentially
powerful group which has so far made few constructive inroads
into the system: undergraduate students who take Education
courses.

Student reaction to Ed courses has been characterized by
assorted feelings of tolerance, apathy, somnolencc, and disgust.
Yet no constructive ideas were forthcoming until last spring when
a handful of students with concrete suggestions attempted to
organize and put to work several hundred strike-bound students
interested mainly in attending rap sessions, What traces remain of
last spring‘s activity in this area are largely the result of Dean
Gardner’s efforts. And this year, organization of undergraduates
remains a demanding task: 'l‘wu showed up at a hearing last
Monday on the Berger Proposal to make all undergraduate Ed
courses elective; eight students responded to announcements and
phone calls about a meeting of the Student Advisory Council
Tuesday night; classroom reaction has become more vocal in favor
of change, but so far few students have devoted extra-curricular
time to the Teacher Ed Program.

The last paragraph of the Berger Proposal ends with the
exhortation: “Why do we have to wait for students to tell us what
is wrong?...Why not...initiate the change ourselves?" Faculty
members-as well as a number of graduate students-have already
made ﬁrst steps toward change, and all Ed professors. with few
exceptions, him: either shown a Iolcrancc for student criticism or
have expressed great anxiety that not enough students are being
heard.

Despite the disappointing ﬁgures mentioned above, there are
already a good number of undergraduates interested in finiling out
what‘s going on and in having their say, Right now, and especially
next semester, they tame a number of opportunities: Student
Advisory Council, the Berger Proposal hearings a newly-formed
committee to improve Methods courses, and theI responsiveness of
their own Ed professors. Let us give some direction, and perhaps a
bit more impetus, to the forces for correction already set in
motion. , ,

To the Editor:

it was a pleasure to have an
interview with you last week, and
l have but one observation, and
that is regarding the comments of
Mr. Walter Tisdale and Mr. Buck-
off.

I would like to make it absolute-
ly clear that those who had the
responsibility for planning the
sewer system of the State Univer-
sity were one hundred percent
aware of where sewage was going
from the University, whether into
the sewage treatment plant at
WcstcrIo Island or into Patroon
Creek, For Mr. Buckoff to try to
relieve the State University of its
responsibility is unrealistic. i
doubt if he would have :ipprccizr
ted it if the City had refused to let
the drainage from the Univcristy
go into the City of Albany sewer
sy..tcm.

The State University is a pollut-
cr as is the Tobin Packing Com-
pany, and other sewage going into
Patroon Creek. The responsibility
primarily rests with the people of
the state and nation whose inter
est in cleaning up thi.l waters of
this country is comparatively re-
cent.

I would also like to point out
that the City of Albany did build
a sewage treatment plant prior to
lililtl—modcrn when it was built.
The people of Albany have spent
over $5,000,000 on its construc-
tion and operation, and because
of the fact that none of the
municipalities on the other side of
the Hudson constructed any treat-
ment facilities, the people of
Albany ill l‘ffL‘t'l received no ben-
0 fit from their more than
$5,000,000 expense. 1 might also
point out that it has been general-
ly recognized that the City of
Albany took the local lead in
furthering, enthusiastically, the
State's Pure Waters Program.

Sincerely yours,
Erastus Corning
Mayor of Albany

Rules

To the Editor:

it seems that many people on
campus feel justifyably outraged
at the national bullshit that they
seemingly can't do much about:
senators who are both directors of
large banks and cummittecmen
for financial policy, judges who
start racist country clubs and then
rule on discrimination suits, presi-
dents who urticulute about “unit-
ing our divided country" iind smil‘
ineg accept llllrdlllllll.

Yet i, for one. am just as angry

at the bureaucratic bullshit that
goes on in our own university; the
rules without reasons, the arbitrar-
y privileges, the unnecessary ex-
ploitations. Meaningless rules such
as allowing only three people to
visit someone in the infirmary;
arbitrarily established privileges
such as not permitting a student
to have a kitten in a suite yet
allowing a dorm director directly
below to have a dog; strictly
selﬁsh exploitations such as for-
cing anyone who resides in univer-
sity dormitories to buy an FSA
meal plan (How are they related?)
or implementing a clever book»
store policy in which getting the
discounts on textbooks is made
such a hassle that nobody ever
bothers.

Dig it: it We allow this kind of
shit in a micro-community of
15,000 people what kinds of shit
will We allow in the macro-com-
munity of 200 million that awaits
us all'.’

Not Enough?

To the Editor:

As a staunch member of the
SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY, i
am very proud of the way the
SOCIALlST LABOR PARTY eun-
didates, headed by former subway
dispatcher Steve Emery for Gover-
nor, conducted themselves in the
recent campaign.

In contrast to other so-called
Marxist parties, the SLP candi-
dates did NOT mukc a chap bid
for votes by indulging in reform
bait promises but stressed the
validity of making the much
needed imperative change from
capitalism to socialism.

Sooner or later the working class
majority is bound to accept the
solution offered by the SOCIAL
[S'l‘ LABOR PARTY, the sooner
the better!

i noted the remarks made by
Basil Paterson as reported in the
Oct. 6 ALBANY STUDENT
PRESS.

To be against the war in Viet-
nam is NOT enough. in order to
get rid of war entirely, capitalism
bus to be abolished because it is

capitalism with its profit motive
that breeds war.

The logical thing to do is to
work to bring about Socialism
where production will be for use,
with the industries of the country
belonging to ALL the people,
NOT to a few as is the case today.

Nathan Pressman
Member of the SLP

Palestine

To the Editor:

The ideas of Mr, Bob Warner in
this article are those of a person
totally ignorant of the real situa
tion in the Middle East. He fails to
recognize that the basic issue is
that lsruel has had unjustly dis-
placed ii peaCcful people giving
them misery in plaCe of a para-
dise. it is this trend of ignoring
the desires of the Palestinians that
characterized the efforts of the
Zionists, the British, and the Arab
statesmen and that complicated
the problem and made it insolu-
blc. We, Palestinians, are not
opposed in priniciple to the desire
of the Jews to bow astute of their
own, but we are deﬁnitely op-
posed to anybody who cncroaches
upon our land and occupies it by
force. What is dangerous in the
logic of Mr, Warner is that ht-
reiterates the lsracli configura-
tions of the situation without
reflecting upon them. Thus, ls-
ruel‘s non-acceptance of the Pules'
tininans, the original owners of
the country, is just and reason-
able; the Arabs are notorious,
they have rabid minds, and they
hate the Jews! By the same token.
it is only just and reasonable that
lsracl would take over land by
force expanding its territories and
building new colonies anti settle-
ments as in the West Bank, the
Sinai, and the Golan Heights. This
is why we say that Israel is expanr
sionist and imperialist, if lsrael is
democratic, it is only in the sense
that Great Britain or France was
democratic with the British or the
French and despotic with the
“backward subjects." if Israel
were a forerunner of economic
socialism how could you explain
the fact that. she has been continu-
oust financed by capitalistic indi-
Viduuls, firms, and states right
from the beginning till the pre-
sent? What we should realize is
that, if we should correct the
injustices done to the Jews in the
West we should not achieve this
by creating further injustices to
the Palestinians in the East. Final;
ly, the decision to assimilate in
another country or not is for the
Palestinians to make not for their
oppressors.

ASP Sets Goals For Future

Growth and change will direct
the Albany Student Press in the
coming semester, according to
newly elected Editor-in—Chief
Tom Clingan.

Plans for a thrice weekly
publication, expanded coverage
and staff, and membership in an
advertising cooperative will hope-
fully be completcd by the next
semester. The increased revenues
through the business Venture will
provide most of the funding for
the expansion of the paper when
coupled with projected additional
appropriation from Student
Association.

The printing of three issues per
week is the culmination of an
extensive re-organi'iation of the
Albany Student Press Iii-gun this
svmesti'r under the leadership of
Neill Shanahan. This hail led to
several innovations this scincsti-r:
sixteen page issues, highlighting
the general format of lwnlvo page
issues, some use of color, and it
new arrangement for more if
fit‘it‘lll production

Next semester's goals will allow
many of the editors of the ASP to
examine and evaluate their posi~
[ions on lilt‘ paper with the iivvrall
dirci'lion of their education al the

that no long range permanent
policies have been determined yet
regarding the relationship of the
calendar to religious holidays. the
new calendar Will suspend classes
for Bush llashanii and Yom
Kippur.

The Senate brought up a few
minor objections, though, to the
new calendar, such as a lack of a
reading day before the finals, and
the fact that there are til Mon~
(lays in the schedule. This affects

university. The absence of u jour-
nalism school and courses has
been a barrier to expansion of the
paper. An increase in productivity
necessitates an increased staff,
both technical and reportoriai.
Action through various com—
mittees seem to indicate the uni-
versity's interest in this area, but
as yet this has been a seriously
neglected area of study.

“With the stress on educational
communication on this campus,
it‘s surprising to find absolutely
nothing in the field of journal-
ism," commented Clingan, accn»
rutcly summing up the opinion of
most of the ASP staff.

Membership in the Associated

the growth of the Albany Student

LAAC Requests

Haley Resignation

by Bob Warner
News Editor

David Peck, a member of Cent-
ral Council and Chairman of the
Grievance Committee, accused
Peter Haley, the Assistant Direct—
or of Food Service, of anti»
Semitism, last Thursday night.

The charge centered around a
bill introduced by Ken Stokem
that called for the dismissal of
Haley. Council was asked to en-
dorse this resolution which had
been passed by LAAC.

Council refused to pass judg-
ment on the bill, however, and
tabch it for one week. Yet many
Council members and outsiders
had their say beforehand. There
seemed to be three main positions
in the much heated debate: one of
complete proponancc of the bill,
one of doubt as to the validity of
anyone's documentation, and one
of outright antagonism to the bill,

Peck's charges were based on a
few signed afﬁdavits and his own
personal accounts, which indi-
cated, he said, that Haley had not
only been rude, but had "been
proven to be anti-Semitic." He
referred to what he called Haley's
Uhostile" attitude toward the
kosher meal plan. He also said
that Haley refused to permit a
student to break the lunch cont-
ract, which had been recommend
by a doctor for reasons of health.

The skeptics of Pcck’s argument
against Haley could not, they said,
sit in judgment of a man's job on
such little evidence, and therefore,
requested Haley's presence the
following week so that he could
answer the charges. it must be
noted, though, that Council has
no power of employment. in this
case; it may only recommend ac»

Oil.

The strongest opponents of the
bill defended Haley's character

and competence. Some Council
members were outraged that Peck
could accuse a man of such a
controversial charge without, as
they put it, sufficient docu-
mentation.

On another controversial bill
that was introduced by five mem-
bers of Council, Council narrowly
voted to table a bill that would
have “disbanded” Central Council
and frozen all Student Association
budgets.

The intent of the bill was to
create a push for a new SA consti-
tution by March of 1971; the
decapitation of Council was a way
of getting students to come out
and vote on the constitutional
referendum, Some students, how‘
ever, noted the setbacks of such a
bill. Some said that the break—up
of Council or the refunding of
student tax monies if the required
20% of the student body did not
vote, would be an incentive for
students to stay away from the
polls.

The Council seemed to be in
agreement, though, that a new
constitution was imperative.

Council, in other action, endors-
ed the LAAC proposal which calls
for the reduction in room rates
for residents of lndian Quad, Poor
living conditions were cited as the
prime motivations for the bill.
Council endorsed the recomm-
endation by a white ballot, which
designates wholehearted and
unanimous support.

Council, by a 21-0-4 vote,
appropriated $1,075 to
BLACKSPHEMY, the black lit-
erary magazine.

Council recommended to FSA,
by a vote of 25-0-1, that
Commodore Cleaners and Laun-
derers be granted an on campus
monopoly of dry cleaning service
outlets. Roxy Cleaners, the pres-
ent dry cleaning service, decided
not to participate in the bidding.
