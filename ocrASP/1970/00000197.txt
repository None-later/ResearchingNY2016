ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Johnpoll Denied Premotion

byVicki Zeldin
News Editor

Dr. Bernard Johnpoll. Associate
Professor of Political Science, has
not been recommended by his
department for promotion to a
full professorship.

Johnpoll came to SUNYA in
1966, and since he has been here,
he has published three books and
has just received ii contract for
another '

Johnpoll deliniuted the reasons

for his not being promoted, as he
understands it. According to
Johnpoll, he is considered a trou-
ble maker by his department, and
he remarked that “I think that
maybe this school is so bad that it

scholarship." In discussing scho-
‘larship and publishing. he asserted
that “publications must make a
contribution to learning not just
to a discipline." He also felt that
it is unfortunate that the deﬁni-
tion of scholarship “is in very set
limits.”

Johnpoll felt that GSPA has
"spat" in his “face, and has spat
in the students‘ faces." “i feel
that i am no longer bound by the
normal ammenities of notice, and
if I decide to leave I might just
not show up in September."

Johnpoll expressed his apprecia-
tion to his students and the de-
partment's junior faculty mem-
bers for supporting him in his bid
for promotion. The Under-

senior faculty and the department
chairman who did not recommend
him. Their decision now goes to
the Universitv Council on Pro-
motions and Continuing Appoint-
merit.

The Undergraduate Political

‘Science Association met yesterday

and decided to set up an Ad Hoc

Committee which would attempt

to have the promotion decision
reversed. An open letter to Webb
Fiser, chairman of the depart-
ment. expressing dissatisfaction
with the senior faculty’s decision
was formulated. A petition was al-
so to be drawn up ’

A visibly shaken Bernard John-
