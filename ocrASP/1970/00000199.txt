“To what degree of your misunderstanding

by Jose Luis Torres
and Carlos Arroyo

Do you understand?

To what degree of your rhetoric
Do you truly and honestly perceive?"

Board

After attending the second per-
forrriance of We Righteous Bomb-
ers, a play by Kingsley Bass, Jr.,
directed Spencer Jackson, I
noticed how far from revolu-
tionaries the so-called revolution-
aries of today are. The play was
supposed to be portraying the
counter-revolution of the Ameri-
can revolutionaries. All the revolu-
tionary rhetoric usedin the play
only helped to show how ridicu-
lous this rhetoric really can be.
Though truthful in essence, it was
most boring to hear this rhetoric
over and over again.

The play itself was too long, the
opening with special light and
sound effects last too long and got
the audience tired. The acting in
general was very poor, except for
Ramon Colon, Booker T. Mallory,
and Linda Smith who gave very
convincing performances.

The content of the play itself
was stereotyped The roles of each
character were phony and many
times sounded too poetic to relate
to any street situation. I feel that
Kingsley Bass had very good in-
tentions in writing the play, but he
wrote it in a manner that could
not be related to the actual Black
revolution of today.

An interesting thing about the
play was that the leading role of
Murray Jackson was played by
Ramon Colon, a Puerto Rican,
which shows that Blacks and Puer-
to Ricans can relate to the same
struggle towards liberation.

During the past semester, we
have had seven concerts, and as
the saying goes, “You learn from
experience." Each concert has
brought its own problemThere I
have been over a thousand dollars
worth of damage, numerous cases

         
 

    

of people being taken to the
hospital because of drug abuse
and overdoses and arrests made
because of vandalism, fights, and
various other reasons. With all
these cases, one fact has stood out
above all: every problem has been
with kids under eighteen.

This is the main reason for re-
quiring a college ID. or proof of
being 18 years of age or older. We
hope that by limiting sales to the
above mentioned groups, we will
be eliminating most of the bullshit
that's been going on, and there-
fore insure better concerts

Concerts arranged by this school
are funded by student tax, and
therefore are present for the bene-
ﬁt of our students.

And for all of you people who
want to see it happen, there are 6
new positions open onUniversity
Concert Board. If you are inter
ested in applying there is a man-
datory meeting this Tuesday, Dec.

8 in LC 1 at 7:00 p.m. Appli-
cations will be available only at
the meeting. See you there!

‘The Strawberry Statement’ -
A Berry Good Album

by Jeff Burger

The Strawberry Statement
(MGM 2SE-l4ST) is nothing to
scream about, only because most
of it is taken from other albums
probably familiar to you. Just the
same, it's damn good, and worth
getting maybe even if you have
most of the cuts on other albums.

First of all, the selection of cuts
is excellent. Somehow they hold
together and make one well said
statement, even though they often
contradict each other. (Lennon &
McCartney's "Give Peace A Chan-
ce“ says an entirely different
thing than Thunderclap Newman‘s
“Something In the Air"). It
should be noted that everything is
done by original performers with
the one exception of "Give Peace
A Chance" which is performed by

the cast, but surprisingly well.

I mentioned that it might be
worthwhile to get the album even
if you own most of it on other
LP’s. That's because it can be
interesting to hear music in a new
context and a new order; you're
used to the steady place occupied
by each cut on the LP's you now
own. On this record, you’re listen-
ing to “Concerto in D Minor" and
suddenly there’s Neil Young with
CSer singing "Helpless." Pretty
powerful change: you hear “Help-
less" in a whole new way than
you heard it on the CSN&Y al-
bum surrounded by other CSN&Y
material. The changes are always
effective and refreshing; the music
included is, for the most part,
excellent.

The album also includes the
“Theme From the Movie" a four

part instrumental piece; one part
is on each record side). It is
performed by the MGM Studio
Orchestra and before I played the
record, I prepared myself for
shopping center Muzak. It isn't. It
is beautiful and soothing and
really fine, especially “Pocket
Theme" on the fourth side. All in
all, an amazingly good album con»
sidering the fact that it‘s com-
posed mostly of old material.

LightfootﬁusihA

by Jeff Burger
Saturday night seemed like the
perfect night to go to the gym,
maybe because Gordon Lightfoot
and Tom Rush were scheduled to
play there. I got there about nine.

flashed my psychedelic press card,
and walked into the gym,

I came upon a rather freaky
looking gentleman who, for all his
freakiness, appeared to be official-
ly involved with the proceedings.
"Are you with Tom Rush?" I
asked. "I'm Tom Rush," he an-
swered. "Oh," I said. Tom was
enjoying a cigarette under the No
Smoking sign, He was smiling.

The concert got under way
about a quarter to ten with a per-
formance by a chick named
Leona. I have the feeling that I
would‘ve liked her a whole lot
better if I'd been familiar with the
songs. As is, she was pretty good,
but not at all outstanding.

When Tom Rush appeared, we
were ready for him, and he was
more than ready for us. He was
accompanied by Trevor Verch,
who's been with him for two
years now, and by James Rolles-
ton, who’s only been working
with him for a month. Both are
very competent and they comple-
ment Rush's music perfectly. The
word for the group is together.

They began with a smooth and
pretty song called “These Days."
Then came “When She Wants
Good Loving My Baby Comes To
Me" and "Colors of the Sun."

Someone in the audience called
a request for “Circle Game."
“Shut up," said Tom; a moment
later he smiled and ﬂashed the
peace sign. He didn't play the
song.

Tom closed his set to a standing
ovation. He returned alone for a
solo c encore, "The Child ‘5 Song."
Tom has proven himself to the
satisfaction of the entire audi-
ence: after the encore, he left to
applause that went on for as long
as any applause I can ever remem-
ber hearing.

A short intermission followed; it
was characterized by the noticuble
and pleasant absence of a bomb
scare. Then suddenly the lights
were dark again and Gordon
Lightfoot was onstage withoutso
much as an introduction. You got

way.

This guy is a professional and a
folk classic. The reasons why are
all in his performance. Among the
songs that he played: “Softly,”
"Boss Man," “Sit Down Young
Stranger," “Pussywillows Cat-
tails," “Did She Mention My
Name?" "Ribbon of Darkness,"
“I'm Not Saying," and “Moun-
tnins and Marianne" ("Dedicated
to American friends living per-
manently in Canada”).

My favorites included Kris Kris-
tofferson's “Me and Bobby
McGee" and “For Lovin' Me," an
old tune of Gordon's which
helped make Peter, Paul and Mary
famous years ago. The set ended
with another superb Lightfoot
song which shows just how good a
songwriter he is: “Early Morning
Rain." There was loud applause
and the inevitable standing ova-
tion. Lightfoot returned to play
“Canadian Railroad Trilogy."

During the set, Gordon was ac-
companied by Red Shea on lead
guitar and Richard Haynes on
bass. Gordon alternated between a
12 string and a 6 string guitar.
“Twelve string for strummin‘, six
string for pickin'," as he later
explained.

After the concert, six of us
squeezed into a tiny Volkswagon
and headed downtown, skidding
and sliding in the snow. Every-
body was feeling good. The con-
cert has had its subtle effect on all
of our lives. After it was over,
Vicki got hit with a snowball. And
the next day, Chris came by to
borrow an onion. Jane is mum-
bling schitzo plans for the future
in her apartment next door. Rich
still hasn't gone to sleep. And as
for Kaz, she's crashed out on my
living room floor with a blanket
wrapped over her head. She's

After their sets, I interviewed
each performer. Here are portion!
of those interviews:

ASP: Tell us about your new
album.

RUSH: It's called “Wrong End
of the Rainbow," which is the
name of the title song, which I
wrote. It‘s on Columbia and
should be in the stores in a few
weeks.

ASP: Who would you list among
your musical inﬂuences?

RUSH: Well, I started in Cam-
bridge, Mass., playing with Eric
Von Schmidt, Baez and Jim Kwel-
kin, among others. So them. And
a cat named Robert L. Jones. And
another maned Jeff Moldor.

ASP: What music are you listen-
ing to lately?

RUSH: Oh, Otis Redding. And
the Brewer and Shipley Band.
And the Stones. Their new album,
the live one. They don't even have
to be good because they're so fa-
mous. But they're fantastic, unbe-
lieveable.

ASP: You seem to spot talented
songwriters long before anyone
else. You recorded Joni Mitchell
and James Taylor songs, long be-
fore most people had even heard
of them. How do you spot talent?

RUSH: I have good taste in ma-
sic.

ASP: Have you ever thought of
adding a drummer to your group?

RUSH: Been thinking about it
for two years; haven’t gotten
around to it yet.

ASP: Did you dig the audience
tonight?

RUSH: Yeah, I thought they
Were a great bunch to play for.

ASP: Did you hear that amazing
applause after your encore? '

RUSH: Yeah, I would've played
some more, but “The Child's

 

Song" is the only one I play by
myself at this point and the other
two guys were already halfway to
a bar.

Gordon Liglitfoot

ASP: How long have you been
playing?

GL: Well, I'm thirty-one now.
I’ve been playing professionally
for twelve years, since I was nine-
teen. But I got my ﬁrst paying gig
when I was twelve, made five dol-
lars. Before I started writing, they
were calling me a country singer.
Now some people call me a folk
singer. But I'm just a singer, you
know?

ASP: Have you heard Bob Dy-
lan‘s version of your “Early
Moring Rain?"

GL: Yeah, I think it's fantasic. I
think the whole SelfAPorlrait A
lbum is great, just fantastic.

ASP: Where are you from?

GL: Ontario, home of Joni Mit-
chell and Leonard Cohen.

ASP: Who Were you influenced

y?

GL: Well, Bob Dylan. And Kris
Kristofferson. Bob Gibson. Inn

Tyson taught me a lot of what I
know.

ASP: Say something brilliant
about the differences you notice
between Canada and the US.

GL: Well, I wouldn‘t want to
trade places with an American
now. And it's too bad that Viet-
nam has been virtually forgotten.

ASP: How did you think the
concert went tonight?

GL: Well, I thought the audi-
ence was just great. I was sort of
rushing through song after song. I
was trying to play as many son.
as I could for the people in the
time that I had.

ASP: Were you given a limited
time for your set?

GL: No, I just knew it had been
a long night and I wanted to play
just enought and stop before the
audience got tired. It was pretty
late. But we were out there for
something a bit over an hour.

ASP: What projects are you
currently involved in?

GL: Well, I don’t like to do tele-
vision usually, but we‘re taping a
Johnny Cash show this week.
