ALBANY'STUDENT PRESS

For the seventh consecutive year
the American Dental Association
is sponsoring the-Program in Den-
tal Research for College Students
under a grant from the National
Institute of Dental Research. This
program makes , it possible for

-selected pre-baccalaureate college
students to spend 10 weeks in the
laboratory of a senior dental sci-
entist who is working in the field
of the student's career interest.

The overall objective of the pro-
gram is to identify exceptional

students and to furnish insight,
through a direct experience, to
the challenges that exist in oral
biology and related research.
Since the scope of oral science
includes the entire spectrum of
basic and clinical disciplines, this
program should be of interest to
those students planning to work
toward advanced degrees in the
biological, physical and behavioral
sciences as well as students ori-
ented toward medicine and dentis-

ry.
Successful candidates will be

Jordan, Sheehan, Ouattrocchi Foul Out

Dane Netters Fall Short

Albany Stiitc narrowly missed
upsetting a powerful Stony Brook
five this past Saturday, its Werner
Kolln's 30 foot desperation shot
at the buzzer missed the mark illld
left Albany on the short end of il
67-66 score.

The loss made history, for it was
the first time in Coach Richiird
"Doc" Saucrs‘ 16 year career with
the Danes that he has ever lost the
first two games of the season.

Stony Brook, who finished 18-6
last year and now stands at 30,
led most of the way. They opened
up a 60-50 bulge with eight min-
utcs left but saw it slowly dissolve
as tthunes battled back.

With 2:54 remaining, the
Patriots still led, 67-64, and the
score was frozen until Al Reid
made good on a jumper with 8
seconds left to put things at
67-66. The Danes were then
forced to foul with only a few
seconds on the clock. Doc called
his last time out, and instructed

The Dane Griipplers finished
second in the meet with 53

78, while Williams rind Dartmouth
were third rind fourth with 52 and
37 points, respectively,

game. The foul shot was missed
and Albiiiiy crime down with the

but Al was double teamed and
hurl to pass off to junior Don Joss.
.loss whipped it to Kolln who let
loose with ll desperation heave as
the buzzer sounded The range
was fine but it was off to the
right.

Using up the last time out be-
fore the foul shot made it
impossible for the Danes to set
up any kind of a play. If Doc had
another timeout to work with, he
no doubt would have used it and
set up a shot, possibl; for Bob
Rossi, who was on the bench at
the time.

Fouls onee again plagued the
Danes as Jack Jordan fouled out
with 7: 15 remaining and took his
twenty ﬁve points to the bench.
Sheehun and Quattrochi soon

joined him as they both picked up
their fifth and ﬁnal personal in
the second half.

Both teams shot for 40% from
the floor, but foul shooting was

Binghamton was not on Al-

Matmen Drop Opener

Gargiii says the team has im-
proved tremendously but has no
depth. “If someone gets hurt, we
have no one to throw in there."
Again, this is caused by ii problem
that plagues all coaches of Albany
‘ experienced students not going
out for the team and the inability
to recruit because of the school's
admissions policy.

This Wednesday, Albany travels

to Troy to meet RPl. The Danes
have lost to the Engineers for the
last 2 years. For that reason and
also because RPI couCh Eugene
Monaco was a former westler
under Garcia, State is, according
to the latter, going to "go after
the r iiiils.“

Saturday, they meet Rochester
in the Gym in the first dual meet
against the westerners ever.

Swimmers Smash Records

The varsity Mernien of Coach
Brian Kelly lost to a powerful
R,l.T. swimming team Saturday
by a score of 74-35. While the
margin of victory was quite high,
the Dane coach was far from
displeased. The R.I.T. team was
vastly improved from last year
due to an ambitious recruiting
program. The Albany team is
handcuffed in the field of recruit-
ing by strict academic require-
ments and lack of scholarships.
Besides feeling that his team had
performed well for this early in
the season, Conch Kelly was
