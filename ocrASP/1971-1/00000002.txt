Howard Project:

Town Planned

by Stephanie DiKovics

Ebenezer Howard is not a catch-
word designed to make you curi-
ous enough to investigate the real
meaning. It is the real name of a
real man who in Britain designed
and built two towns that ap-
proached an Utopian ideal.

Irt Albany, the Ebenezer Ho-
ward Project cncompasscs his
theories and their relation to an
integrated (in the sense of being
socially, academically, and envi-
ronmentally balanced) communi-
ty.

The Student Association at Al-
bany has hired two graduates of
Albany State, Doug Goldschmidt
and Stratton Rawson. to shape
and direct the activities necessary
for the success of the Project
Practically speaking, the initial
goals are to make housing availa-
ble to the increasing number of
students, and possibly to form a
coalition with RPI which would
increase the potential scope of the
Project.

Problems hindering the attempt
to build a successful collcgthluwn

are the lack of abailable funds,
lack of library research facilities,
the Project's nebulous status in
the eyes of most people. and most
definitely the shortage of person-
nel actually working to achieve
the Project’s goal.

Legislative Hot line

ALBANY. NY. AP - A citi-
zens' "hot-line“ has been
installed inthe Capitol to permit
New Yorkers to inquire about the
status of measures before the
legislature.

A telephone call to the number
1-800‘342-9860 will connect with
a secretary who has a computer at
her disposal to track the progress
of a bill.

It‘s an effort, Senate Majority
Leader Earl W, Brydgcs says, “to
bring the legislative process closer
to the people back home."

Snack Bar has New Face

by Robert IIaIdassano

The Campus Center Struck Bar
has a new look and those who
have not seen it would be well
advised to check it out.

The “face lifting“ operation was
performed by a group of twelve
students who used the Christmas-
-lntcrccssion break to rcdccorate
the Snack Bar. Many changes were
made and there are some still
pending. Among the more notice-
able is the removal of the parti-
tion dividing the Snack Bar and
the Rathskellar. Barnboard, artifi-
cial beams and brick have been
extended along the wall closest to
the food service area.

An AM'I’M radio and tape stere-
o system has been installed with
eight speakers. The jukebox has
been I‘l‘lanCLI and free music will
now be available on a continuous

basis. Genuine wagon wheels have
been attached to the sides of the
spice table. As soon as they arrive,
crimson burlap drapes will cover
the two walls which have wins
dows.

This project was performed as
the result of a survey taken by the
Campus Center Governing Board
during last November. Surveys
were handed out at dinner lines
on the quads and this resulted in
the redecoration of the snack bar.

The total cost of the project was
$10,000. The money to support
the renovation was provided by
the Student Facilities Fund,
which is derived from alumni con-

tributions. The Campus Center
Governing Board and Gary Jones,
Director of the Campus Center
and of Strident Activities, request‘
ed the money, and the job began.
The twelve students who did al-

most all the labor except the
installation of the stereo equip-
ment, lights, and drapes, were
paid. This direct approach to the
redesign of the snack bar was an
experiment and Gary Jones hopes
that it is only the beginning of
such student participation.

Dorm and Administrators Talk

by Kenneth Deane

A novel approach to student-administrator com-
munication was explored Wednesday evening. by
the residents of Van Cortlandt “1‘”
university administrators, Dr. Clifton ’l‘horne, Vice
President for Student Affairs; Dr.
Director of Residence; and Neil Brown, Dean for

Student Life.

The meeting. arranged by the residents of Van
Cortlandl Hall. was (I csigncd to give sludcnts greater
access and insight to our complex university admin-
istration and its personnel, It also gavo students an
opportunity to air their views and receive immediate
responses to many of their questions. In the casual
and intimate atmosphere of the residence lounge,
the three administrators spoke of their personal
backgrounds and the scope of their administrative
duties. Following short introductions the floor was

opened for questions.

Perhaps the most demanding question put to the
three men was that of residence security and the '
incident of the improper entrance into
closed dormitories during the recent intercession by
the Times Union columnist Barnett Fowler. All
three llll'n recognized the degree of the problem.
which is being met by an increased security force

and changes in residence lock configurations. How
ever, the consensus of opinion was that any compre-
hensive plans for security would be hampered by a

With regards to the problem of unauthorized
Indivtduuls entering closed residence halls, the three

administrators reiterated the university‘s policy of

attempting to maintain the student's privacy as far
as possible. They also stated that those university
personnel found permitting unauthorich indivi-
duals entrance into closed dormitories would be
severely reprimanded.

Another question which recoivcd thorough dis-
cussion was the financial state of the university
system. Dr. Thornc commenting on this question
explained that the state university system is in
direct financial straits, necessitating a cutback in

personnel and university services. He also admitted

‘ that. as a result of the state‘s monetary difﬁculties a
rise tn tuition is likely.

Similar discussions as the one held in Van Cort-
landtHull can be conducted in the other residence
halls. Those halls which are interested in such
meetings should directly contact Dr. ’l‘hornc, Dr.
Fisher and Mr. Brown.

Seylee Hall

by Bob Kanarek

On January 3, Barnett Fowler, a
columnist for the Times Union,
presented a rather vivid descrip-
tion of the second floor lounge in
Slyles Hall. It had been badly
defaced by students. Fowler also
described the condition of some
student rooms which he felt were
exceptionally dirty. The article
raised certain questions pertaining
to University property.

University policy states that stu-
dents responsible for damage to
the University Residence Halls
will be billed accordingly. Present-
ly, Alice Mandelberg, Residence
Director of Sayles Hall, is inter-
viewing all of the students in the
dorm individually, to determine
who is responsible for the damage.
Several students have admitted to
being guilty.

The foremost quesiton in the
minds of many students is: "How
did an unauthorized person gain
access to student rooms. let alone
lounges and the building itself?"
It is a Residence Office policy
that no one is allowed into stu-
dents' rooms unless the student is

At Issue: Policy

Charles Fisher. claimed that the
Residence staff let no one in the
dorms. Thus it appears that either
maintenance or security was‘ at
fault. Exactly who let Fowler into
the dorm without his going
through the proper channels in
uncertain to date.

Buffalo

BUFFALO AP —- A judge dis-
missed Tuesday, criminal con-
tempt charges that had been filed
against 45 State University at
Buffalo faculty members for a
campus demonstration.

Still pending against the 45 are
criminal trespass charges. They are
scheduled for jury trial beginning
Feb. 8. The 45 were arrested last
March 15 while staging a sit-in at
the Hayes Hall administration
building after a series of student-
police clashes on campus.

The faculty members were ac-
cused of violating a court order
banning interference with univer-
sity functions, but in dismissing
the charge Judge H. Buswell
Roberts of City Court ruled there
were insufficient facts to justify
the charge.
