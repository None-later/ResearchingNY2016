Brooks’ Twelve Chairs -
A Wooden Tour De Farce

by Tom Quigley

Mel Brooks' THE TWELVE
CHAIRS is one of those ﬁlms in
which the principle characters
Ipend more than an hour and a
half of celluloid collecting a
specific number of objects. The
audience diligently plays the game
by keeping count in order to see if
the exact number of objects being
sought is finally collected.

By the end of this movie, a
friend and I counted about twen-
ty-five chairs, two inadequate per-
formances, two inspired perfor-
mances, numerous witty passages,
almost as many boring moments,
and one very confused and poorly
executed satire entitled THE
TWELVE CHAIRS.

Mr. Brooks is the eminently
talented satirist and comic who
gave us last year‘s insanely hilari—
ous film THE PRODUCERS.
Brooks devotees and some short
sighted critics have been scandal-
ously overpraising this latest
effort as a comic masterpiece. It is
certainly Icss original than his last
film and not nearly as funny as
some of the publicity that it has

A display of distinctive photo-
graphs and a collection of con-
temporary art works went on ex-
hibit yesterday at the Art Gallery.

The photographs, by SUNYA
Professor Wayne Lcnncbakcr, are
studies of figures moving through
space, and employ time exposures
and other unusual techniques.
They include both color and black
and white studies.

The showing, which will con-
tinue through February 2i, also
includes “Critic‘s Choice

cludes films, video tapes, paint-

been receiving.

Brooks usually begins with a
paper thin premise and then ex-
pects the audience to suspend its
sense of credibility in order to
appreciate his insane perception
and caustic lampoon that floods
the screen. This kind of wild
nonsense, complete with the mad-
capped performances of Zero
Mosth and Gene Wilder, is pre-
cisely what made THE PRO-
DUCERS such an absurd and bril-
liant film.

In this case the miniscule pre-
mise concerns three greedy com-
rades in post-revolutionary Russia
who are tracking down twelve
dining room chairs, one of which
is stuffed with diamonds. Within
this pithy plot Brooks rips off
numerous tragicomic comments
about the nature of human ava-
rice, pride, and poverty.

This newest effort is plagued by
miscasting, the poor use of actors,
and an unexplained plot complica-
tion that is rather annoying. Ron
Moody and Frank Langella (the
old and new with apologies to
Eisenstein) seem to be chasing the
correct set of furniture. Dom

l'lirst, representing Beatle Paul

DeLuise, the mad priest, somehow
finds about thirteen different
chairs and the confusion is enough
to drive any audience mad. Where
these other chairs came from is
never explained!

Moody and Langella are almost
totally humorless in the lead roles
which is a certain disaster con-
sidering that this is supposed to be
a comedy. Moody underplays
the desperate err-aristocrat but
seems to lack the necassary gusto
in his frantic comic scenes. Lan-
gella, last seen in DIARY OF A
MAD HOUSEWIFE, seems to be
getting typecast as a mean
mouthed bastard. He is sorely out
of place as the bitter, opportunis-
tic youth.

The inspired madness lacking in
the lead roles is supplied by the
supporting characters portrayed
by DeLuise and Brooks himself.
DeLuise, a greatly underrated
actor, is an absolute panic as the
wildly greedy priest. Not only has
he broken his vow of poverty but
used the knowledge of the old
woman‘s deathbed confession to
persuc the worldly loot. Brooks,
sccn briefly as the drunken Tikon,
should have written a larger role
for himself. He is marvelous as the
cowvtowing peasant who wishes
his ex-masler would beat him.

Unforutnately, Brooks, a master
of the one-liner, is not a master of
cinematic technique. Except for a
few beautifully photographed se-
quences, the film shows no par-
ticular inspiration in editing or
visual composition. When the
dialogue is no longer pungent peo-
ple start chasing each other
around pastoral landscapes. The
continuity is such that characters
500”) U) I'llll (ICFOSS each other
accidentally rather than pur-
poscly. All other technical credits
are professional.

'l‘l-lE 'I‘WELVE CHAIRS is a
sincere but deficient satire about
human nature. Hopefully Brooks
will, in the future, choose his casts
with more insane discression and
write a thoroughly lunatic plot
that will make audiences gasp for
air. If anyone can give the abused
comic genre a needed life it will
be the two thousand year old
madman Mel Brooks.
