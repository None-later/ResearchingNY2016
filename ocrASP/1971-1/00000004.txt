Food Stamps:

 

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

For the Poor Only?

by Louise Cook
Associated Press Writer

“11‘ a student is paying over
$2,000 a year in tuition and can-
not afford food, then food stamps
seem to me to be a logical way
for a student to live." That com-
ment from Skip Burgess, a strident
at Elmira College in upstate New
York, reﬂects the feelings of II
growing number of college stu-
dents who have turned to the
federal food stamp program to

make ends meet.

The program, designed to help
the poor, allows qualified recipi-
cats to purchase a specified
amount. of stamps redeemable for
a greater dollar value at partici-
pating grocery stores. Some stu-
dents, living off-campus and away
from their families, have applied
for and received food stamps,
drawing the criticism of several
welfare officials.

“A lot of us think that students
shouldn't be eligible," said Ethel

The flermalh of illegally parked cars-tickets and their appeals-is
one of the responsibilities of the Parking Appeals Committee.

Committee Aids
Parking Problems

The Uiichrsily Parking Appeals
Committee, which has been in
operation since May 1060. grants
special parking permits and re-
Viqu and adjiidicates appeals on
violations of parking regulations.

The Committee is composed of
ii group of nine persons, three
faculty members, three staff meni-
bers and three students. The chair
man is Robert. Wliittain ol' the
Plant,Department. As of this Sep-
tember the Committee had heard
ovr-r 1,000 appeals and ruled on
10:1 special parking permits.

The Committee meets once a
week to hear appeals, eillier by
personal appearance or in written
forms. Applications for appeal~
can be obtained from the Security
Office, the Sliiileiil Association
()l'fiee (Ct? Illli), and at the Infor-
malion Desk on llie l'irsl floor of
the Arlininistralion building. The
appeals should be forwarded to
the Security Office. If a personal
iippeal is fll'Sll'l‘ll. llll' applicant
should place his signalure at the

can go to college, they can get the

vey showed student use of the
food stamps in many states, in-
cluding New York, New Jersey,
California, Pennsylvania, Michi-
gan, Texas, South Carolina, New
Mexico, Rhode Island, Wyoming
and Oregon. Students generally
made up only a small percentage
of the total food stamp recipients
and usually received less than the
maximum allotment. The maxi—
mum allowable earnings and the
amount and value of stamps re-
cipients can purchase varies from
state to state.

95 per cent of Oregon‘s food

James C. Greer «III, director of
the Albany County, Wyo., welfare
program, said about 100 Uiichr~

He said student qualification for
the program was determined on
the same basis as for other low

Greer said that when several
students are living together the
total income is taken into con-
sideralion and one student is
designated “head ol‘ household"
and is the only one allowed to
purchase the stamps. Maximum
allowable earnings range from
$51-15 per month for one person to
$5013 for 10 persons.
