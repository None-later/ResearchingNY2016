Who makes a better teacher—a strict authoritarian type person
or a relaxed permissive type person? In faculty lounges across the
country this vexing question is causing much earnest discussion and
not a few stabbings. Today, to help you find an answer, let me tell you
about the Sigafoos brothers.

The Sigafoos brothers were both professors at a famous Eastern
university (Coloriido School of Mines). Worsham, the elder brother,
taught mica and feldspar. Hymie, the younger, tiiught shafting and
shoring. Worsham was a strict authoritarian who believed the best way
to teach was to stay aloof from his students, to be distant and forbid-
ding. In Worsham’s classes only he talked, nobody else. In fact, not
onlydidn't he let his students talk to him, he didn't even let them look
at him. For years the kids had to fall full length on their bellies every
time \Vorsham entered the classroom rind stay thiit way until he left.
The college finally forced him to stop last spring after ii sophomore
coed named Ethel R. Beinccke died from an overdose of floor wax.
After that Worsham just had the kids drop to one knee.

‘ (Incidentally, speaking of dropping to one knee, it's a very ironic
little story, the story of how this custom began. As you know of course,
it started in Bavaria during the reign of Ludwig the Gimp (1608-1899)
who, as you know of course, had one leg shorter than the other. To
keep the king from feeling self-conscious, his subjects would always
drop to one knee whenever he came gimpiug by. Indeed, they did such
a convmcing job that Ludwig lived all his life believing everybody had
one short leg.

(Now here comes the ironic part: after his deiitli it was discovered
that Ludwig never had a short leg after all! Do you know what he had?
He had his prints buttoned to his vest!)

But I digress. \Vorsham Sigafoos, I say, stayed aloof from his stir-
dents. So what happened? ’l‘he students grew steadin more cowcd and
sullen, triiuma and twitching set in, night sweats followed, and when it
came time for fiiiiils, every man jack of them fliiiiked.

Now let us take Worsham's younger brother llymie. Breezy,
bearded, twinkly, outgoing, dressed always in homespun robes and a
NDVIIJO puberty pouch, Hymie was totiilly unlike his brother (except,
of course, that each had one short leg). llyinie believed the way to
teach was to be a pal to the students, not a despot. lle let the kids

come to class or not, whichever they liked. Classroom discussions were
free and unstructured. Anyone who had anything to say simply spoke
up. Sometimes the class discussed classwark, but more often they just
sat and gassed about life in general or maybe played a little Show and
Tell. (This was especially popular in spring when everybody brought
their Easter chicks to cliiss.)

 

\Vell sir, you guessed it. l-lymlo's class, loved iind fulﬁlled though
they were, flunkcd just like Worsham's, every man jack.

You're frowning, I see. If authority in wrong, you risk, and if
friendliness ls wrong too, what then is rr'ylil? Well air. how about sonic-
thliig right in between? How about striking a perfect balancc~jiiat as,
for example, Miller High Life Beer has done?

Take a sip of Miller and you'll see what I mean. Does it have
authority? You bet it doeal It's brisk, it's bracing, it‘s ardent, it's sub-
stantial, it's forceful. If that's not authority, then I need a new the-
saurue.

Take another sip. Now do you see that along with its authority,
Miller is at the same time a wonderfully friendly beer—affable and
benign and docile and dulcet?

Of course you see that. And that's exactly what I mean by strik-
ing a perfect balance~stalwart yot satiny, lusty yet lambont, strap-
ping yet eoothlng, brawny yet breezy, manly yet mallow, spirited yet
supple. Well air, all I can say is, you find a teacher who combines all
of those qualities and, by George, I'll drink hlml

Danes Runnerup In Xmas Tourney
Take Third In Pocono Classic

by Bob Zaremba

The Albany State Varsity bas-
ketball team has come on very
strong over the Christmas recess.
Going into tomorrow’s game
against Marist , the squad carries a
7-4 record.

With two very impressive wins
during exam week against
Plattsburgh (84-65) and
Binghampton (82-52), the Danes
evened their record at 2-2, and
gave themselves some momentum
in readying for the traditional
Christmas Tournament held here.
On the First night of the tourna-
ment, Albany edged the Engineers
of RPI, 72-611. John Quattroclii
was the clutch man for State in
that one, as he made good on
three l and l situation: in the last
minute and a half of play. The
victory ciirncd State the right to
face Union College and their 5‘7“
boy wonder, Jim ’l‘ediscu, in the
championship game.

State led most of the first half in
the championship game, bul early
in the second half Union cdgi-il on
top and they never gave the ll'iltl
up. A final COlnL' from bchind
effort by Albany fell four points
short and the Danes bowed,
71-67. That ended Albany's string
of three straight Chrislinaa 'I‘nur-

This year's l'reshinziii basketball
tciim, led by (Emu-h Iiuh Lewis,
finds five of elevuii iiicnilwrs Wllll‘
out high school experience. Thus,
while the team has good lalciit,
they are short on experience. The
team's strength appears to bi-
shooting and rebounding, whilc
ball handling and defense and the
lack of quick guards are weak-
ncaacs. As Coach Lcwis notes, "In
order for this team to succeed,
better defense is needed."

This past Wednesday, [he Pups
opposed Colgate and quickly fell
behind by 22 points in the first
liiilf as ii result of their inability lo
handle the Colgate prt-sa. They did
eventually close the gap to eleven
points with l() minutes remaining
in the game but could get no
closer and full victims by the scurr-
of 99-86. It is possible to attribute
the defeat to our newly instituted
academic schedule. There had

nament titles and eight consecu-
tive tourney game victories, dating
back to 1966.

Coach Doc Siiuers and his men
then had a week to prepare for
the Pocono Classic Basketball
Tournament at East Stroudsburg,
Pa. Eight teams were to compete
in the tournament, which is spon~
sored by East Stroudsburg State
College and the Pocono
Mountains Vacation Bureau. It
was the first time the Great Danes
had unturetl the seven year old
it assic, and there was some spectr-
lation llial they were reaching a
hit over their heads, for the com-
petition hI-re was quite a bit
louglicr than that which lhc
Dani-s have come to fat-u. The
boys from SUNYA quickly dis-
cri-rlilcd all lhis, and turned a lot
of heads \villi a Very impressive
third place finish.

The first night saw the Danes

their own tough, steady game, and

upset St. Francis, 65-56. Jim
Mzistcrson had his season's high of
20 points for Statellti of them in
the second half.

The following night Albany
took the floor against the tourney
favorite and ultimate champion,
Buffalo State College, the top
ranked College Division Team in
New York State, iind fourth
ranked in the nation. Doc's boys
staged possibly their best game of
the season, playing even with the
Bengals all the way iind leading by
small margins. Albany was up by
2 with >l miiiulos left but finally
succumbed to the tremendously
[)chrlul Bul‘f‘iilu squall. ’I‘heir
60-53 setback was probably one
of the mural impressch losing ef-

half, as all five starters scored in
double ﬁgures.

After another week’s rest, the
Dane netters squared off against
Hartwick College, the number two
ranked College Division team in
the state. Albany turned in ano-
ther brilliant performance in up-
setting the Warriors, 70-66. The
Danes led by as much as 12 points
in the second half, holding
Hartwiek to nearly 30 points be-
low their game average. It was
only the second loss for Hartwick
on their home court in the last 2%

years.

 

Winding up their Christmas Re-
cess schedule, the Danes traveled
to Hobart College, where they ran
over their hosts, 74-64, for their
third straight victory.

The Danes take this three game
win streak back home to start the
second half of their schedule.
Only two foes have scored more
than 70 points against the Danes,
