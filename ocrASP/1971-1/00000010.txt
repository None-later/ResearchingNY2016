Some English teachers insist that Shak care couldn't possibly
have written the plays attributed to him because the plays arc so fill]
of lofty poetry and he was but the sort of an ignorant country butt-her.

"F‘augh!" say i. What does being a llllli'hﬂl’ have to do with
poetry? It so happens that my own butcher, Wally .I. Sigafoos, who
never went past third grade has written some of the lovcl'ost poems I
ever sawv-exquisite things like “Hail In [hr-r, lifr'lhr sitcl' and "Prime
ribs do not a pol roast make" and "flow do I It’l’lﬂIl Ihcc? In?! our moral
the thumbs" and many, many others, too numerous to list here, in-
cluding "La belle ham sans rncrct'" nan “'I‘Iicrr'n' hanging Danny's
clearer in lite morning" and“ftauk on my rump, yr rnt'yhly,mid despair."
I am pleased to say that Mr. Sigafoos will publish a slim volume of his
verse next spring, called “NoMun Isa Iirr'skrf." Watch for it.

 

So let's have no more snidc allegations that grains is confined to
the upper Classes. In fact, the greatest gvnius 1hr world has over known,
Isaac Newton, was the son of a humblo second baseman, (Not only
humble, but also llnt-mployi-d Ilt't‘iltls‘l' hast-ball didn't gct invr-nlod till
a hundred years later.) But those lowly origins didn't stop Ni-wlon
from making his great discoVi-rit-s, culminating of coursi- in tho third

ASP Changes

Print Times

Due to an eVer increasing Uni-
Vcrsity population, with its ever
increasing activities, the Albany
Student Press will be publishctl
three times a wcek starting Fabric
ary ii, [971.

The reasons for this are mani~
fold. By coming out three limos a
week the news reported will be
more up to date. Each department
will be better able to give i'ulIi-r
and more timely covuragc to Llll'
cycnts that fall undcr its domain.

The newspaper will have each
edition weighted. The Monday pa-
per will allow more room for
sports anti arts since those events
usually occur over the wvckcnd.

’l‘hc Wednesday and Friday Odie
tions will allow for mort- room for
news and for the ASP‘s over one
Iarging fcatu ri-s coveragc.

'I‘hc printing of three editions
cach wot-k will also allow for mori-
columns as wt-Il as for morc uso of
the ASP's newly acquired Associ-
atcd Prcss wirc and PhOIUSL'rVIt'P.

of photo assays and ccnli-rfoltls

New Film Trends
To End Superstars

by Bob Thomas
Associated Press Writer

HOLLYWOOD AP- A survey of
the new film economics indicates
the end of the superstar-the movie
personality whose importance
could attracts salaries up to $1 mil-
lion per picture.

Only one superstar appears to
have survchtl the scverc cutback
in actor's salaries: John Wayne.

Just a couple of years ago,
Wayne was one of" a group of
stcllar performers who were con-
sidcrcd so potent at the box office
that producers would pay them
the equivalent of SI million for a
film—sometimes less initial money,
but with It) per cent of the gross
receipts.

Club members included Julie
Andrews, Barbra Streisand, Lee
Marvin, Clint Eastwood, Jack
Lcmmon, Steve McQueen, Paul
Newman, Burt Lancaster, Kirk
Douglas , Shirley MacLainc
Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor,
Elvis Presley, Sidney Poitier.

Look what‘s happening now.

Julie Andrews hasn't made a
movie in two years. She was re
ported in do “Shir Loves Mc" l'or
MGM and "I Do! I Do!" for the
Mirisch (lo. but both projects
wcrt' L'ancclctl Iwcausc of high
crisis.

Elizabeth Taylor, aitt'r I'iyc sun
cossivc flops at Ill] Inillion apii-cc,
was mactivv for two years. She
now is making a film in London,
taking a largt- percentage of llll'
future incomi- rather than a
salary.

litlsbnnd Richard Burton is also
making a London movie at no
salary. “Al'li-r this onc, I'll go
back to ma million-dollar salary,"
Iti- rcmarki-(l. Not likcly.

Some of the other superstars
have been inactive. ()lhcrs lliIVl'

Douglas, Newman, Lemmun.

Newman, Miss Streisand and
Poitier have formed their own
company, First Artists, although
no films have yet been produced
by the ﬁrm.

Some studio heads now will not
consider star names for roles.
They argue that some of the
biggest recent hits have been with-
out big star names: “The Gradu-
atc,‘ "Easy Rider‘" “M-A-S-H,"
“Midnight Cowboy."

“I don't want. any loading actors
over 35,“ says one production
boss. “The young audicnco can't
identify with anyone older."

A new pattern is developing for
employment of stars. They are
asked to work at little or no
salary, taking instead a share of
hopeful profits.

 

OFF THE RECORDS...

 

by Jeff Burger

DEFROSTED, Frijid Pink (Par-
rot, PAS 71041)

Frijid Pink first came to atten-
tion with their top forty remake
of “House of the Rising Sun"
which was a million selling Ameri-
can and world-wide smash hit.
Now they have a second album
(DEFROSTED) and a new single
taken from that album ("Sing a
Song for Freedom").

Their lead (and rhythm) guitar-
ist, Gary Thompson. calls their
music “high energy style of rock
with blues influences." That dc-
acribes it well. And it’s a good
album, top forty single and all,
It's anything but smooth and deli-
cate; it‘s hard and rough, but it's
good.

Listen to “I'll Never Be Lone-

ly;" musically, it's similar to old
Procol Herum (which means it's
good!). And Kelly Green shows
much ability as a vocalist. He’s
not just singing, he's feeling and
then prolecting what. he. feels.
Finally, the vocal and backup
complement each other perfectly.

This group is better than their
top forty image. They're better
than their commercialized album
cover. They're also better than
they may think they are; some-
times they get a bit pretentious
and try to act out the role they’ve
been cast in. But they’re better
titan top forty; there is a lot of
talen revealed on this album and if
it gets the right exposure, I expect
that Frijid Pink will be taken a bit
more seriously quite soon.
LOOKING IN, Savoy Brown (Par-
rot, PAS 71042)

Did you ever read a book that
you didn’t want to talk about? It's
that way with this record. Not
that it was the best record I've
he'iard this year, but it wasn't bad.
Exeellent guitar work. Excellent
vocals. Excellent material (their
own). Serious blues, well done. I
want. to recommend it but I don't
want to talk about it, because
some music loses a lot. in the
translation. So don't get it before
you hear it, but if you hear it,
you'll probably want it. (It's jes'
some fine ‘merican blues, thus all.
And by a British group, no less).
POWER BLUES, Keel~ Hartley,
Otis Spann, Savoy Brown, John
Maysll, Ten Years After (London,
PS 579)

This is not a quickly thrown
together collection of outtakes.
(Or if it was thrown together
quickly, somebody did a good
job!). The cuts are all excellent,
and they work well together to
provide the listener with just what
the title promises—power blues.

Mayau's three cuts are all “clas-
sic Mayall" if there is such a thing,
considering all the changes that
his music has been through. His
vocals here are the subtly power-
ful understatement that we've
come to expect from Mayall. The
backup is excellent; too bad this
LP doesn't list personnel so I’d
know who to credit along with
Mayall. I like the two cuts written
by Mayall better than his inter-
pretation of Mose Allison's
“Purchman Farm." He gives that a
rather lifeless interpretation that
adds nothing to the song.

Savoy Brown is excellent; this
album includes their live version
of “LouisianaBlues” (9:06) Play it
loud—Power Blues‘.

Also in this collection is Al
Koopcr's "I Can't Keep From
Crying, Sometimes," originally
done by The Blues Project. I'm
prejudiced because I really dug
The Blues Project, but Ten Years
After do provide anintcristing in-
terpretation here. Also on this
album and also by Ten Years
After is "I'm Going Home." I‘m
sure cverybody's heard that by
now; you may be quite tired of it,
but it's good just the same.
