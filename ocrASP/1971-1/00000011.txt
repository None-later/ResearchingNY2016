Marist
Danes,

The Albany State Netters had
their three game win streak snap-
ped Saturday night at the hands
of an experienced and solid Marist
Five.

The Danes traded bailmls with
their opponents in the beginning
of the first half, but the Red
Foxes were able to grab a small
lead, and stretched it to eight at
the half. John Quattroehi who
Coach Sauers describes as, “our
leader on thefloor".saw u lot of
the bench in the first half due to
foul trouble. Jim Musterson pick-
ed up his fourth personal with
3:09 to go in the first half.

As a result of the foul trouble,
Don Joss and Tim Minnehaii saw
some added floor time and did
quite a job for Doc coming off the
bench. Sophomore Dave Welchons
has already established himself as
a very capable minutcman, exhi-
biting some ﬁne floor leadership
and defeme.

In the second half, Murist
began to pull further away
from the faultcring Danes, leading
by as much as 16 (66430). The
experienced Red Foxes featured
four returning Starters from last
year's team, all of them now
averaging over 12 points a game.
They were able to consistently
break State‘s press and find the
open man when they had to. They

had to and they killed time when
they had to.

The Danes did come within five
(67-62) with 6 minutes left but
couldn't put together two buckets
in a row to close the gap anymore.
Marist was scoring easily from in
close, and a fast break lay up with
two minutes remaining gave the
Red Foxes a comfortable 15 point
lead, 77-62. The ﬁnal was 88-66.

Defense, alwayS, has been the
key to the Danes' success, and this
is where they blew their win
streak. Opponents had only been
managing 65.2 points a game go-
ing into Saturday, Murist tacked
over twenty points on to that
with crisp passing and sharp out-
side shooting.

It was the first. time Marist had
been able to take one from
Albany in their history as they
were taking an 0-3 series record
onto the floor Saturday.

State's next opponent is
Buffalo. Wednesday at H230 in the
gym. Doe and his term just haw: to
be up for this one. The Dunes
have tasted defeat from Buffalo,
twelve times, in twelve years. Doc
is hinting that this could he the
year, The team will he looking to
get back in the winning habit and
an unprecedented victory against
Buffalo Wednesday can make
Thursday's practice just beautiful.

Up Your Tuition

Tuition is going to he raised again and as usual you will
have no say in it.

The argument runs as follows. All tuition money goes
straight into the construction fund. The construction fund
predicts $600 million in expenses, but only $300 million
it] income. Since the state is in "financial trouble,"otlicr
sources of income will be searched for by the legislature.
Chances are that students. wtili no one to speak for them.
will once again bear the brunt of the increase.

It would be foolish to argue that we don't need new
facilities, as any student with lecture center classes will tell
you. I believe, though, that the state should fool the bill if
they continue to build concrctc Stone-campuscslike this
one. If the students are to foot the bill for continued
construction. they ought to have some say in what‘s
continually constructed.

As it stands now, the best thing the students of SUNY
can do is band together and hire a good lobbyist in order
to protect ourselves from those who serve us in the state!

Unbiased Priorities

Each year, StudentAssociiilion orders all groups funded
by it to submit new budgets for IllL' coming school year.
The committee which sci‘utiiii/cs, argues. evaluates. cuts.
and then passes Ilicsc budgets on to Central (‘ouncil is
probably the most powerful committee of Student Asso-
ciation, The committee works hard-sometimes every night
for it whole \vcck--ziinl the end product is invariably passed
by the Council. simply because no one wants to go tliru
the process again.

Yet there are many czigcr voluiitceis for this duty, Most
of these have special interests lll cci'tziiii groups-sand that‘s
why they volunteered.

I may be cutting my own fiscal throat biil I would
suggest that SA. aticnipl to get a wide range of
iiou-alligncd students from the general student body on
iliis cominiticc. It would be it much Irucr rcllcction of real
Student Association pi’ioiitics than that of "volunteers"
from special llllt‘lL‘Sl groups.

Icr was sent to Robert Cole, chair-
man of the S'I‘B food fast for the
Navajo Indians.)

Closed Out

To the Editor:

Dear Mr. Cole:

Some days a person has a great
feeling of hope and pride in his
fellow man, and today this is the
day for me, when I received your
letter announcing what your resi-
dent students have done to hpr
the Navajo people.

This is really a true gesture of
belief in humanity, and I wish
only to thank each one for their
contributions.

Many thanks to you and We are
looking forward to recuiving the
money.

Last Friday, (Jan. 22) I had the
very unpleasant experience of not
being allowed entrance to the
Bookstore. Why'.’ Because they said
they were closing. The disturbing
thing about the whole affair was
that the time was 4:15 p. m., and
the sign outside the store claimed
that the store would be open until
4:30 p, m. I heartily suggest that
the Bookstore either change the
sign or clarify at which time they
will no longer let people in.

Very much put out,
William Shapse

Sincerely yours,
Ned A. Hatathli
President
