Kent State: A

What kind of a uniVersity is Kent State? is it the hotbed of radicalism
and permissiveness that the Ohio Grand Jury and super-reactionaries

make it appear to be
before the events of |

ast May found that: “Moststudcnts were either

conservative or apolitical."

Repression is really
one of the leaders of

nothing new to Kent State however. in 1060,
SDS was sentenced to three years after a sit~in,

and therefore, SDS was banned from the campus. And, in the town of

Kent, population 26,0

As far as the acts of

It is the height of hypocrisy, though, to scandalize and smear the

developed movement. One of the earliest lessons learned from the

l07i) May strike at Albany was that individual terrorism was a threat

to the continuation of the strike program.

But why were the students at Kent State killed? Some Wt.'l‘llkiiic(i
because they had assembled to protest the cxtention of the lndochina
war, university complicity with the war, and the invasion of their own
campus by the National Guard. Others were killed for no other reason
than that they were students. Not one of the victims was guilty of
any crime other than practicing their rights of freedom to assembly
and free speech, For this they were deprived of their right to life. The
safety of the Guardsmen was at no time in danger, nor was one of
them even injured; one (lid experience an attack of hysteria when he
realized the results of his actions.

llowevur, it is true that there was a conspiracy at Kent. After the
killings, the Guardsmen agreed that they would all give the same line
to the press and FBI investigators. They would all claim that their
lives were endangered, that objects had been thrown at them with
lethal force, and that they had been fired upon. Although the
evidence of this conspiracy comes from a suppressed i"Bl report which
was first I'chach on the floor of the Senate by Stephen Young of
()bio, it has been played down or totally ignored by the mass media.
(For further information on the conspiracy, consult either the
November 2 issue of Li“. Stone‘s Bi-Weekly, or his article in the
December It New York ltcvicw of Books).

As far as calling the killings “murder,” the second source mentioned
alone calls attention to the fact that Agnew himself admitted on the
Band Frost Show tlial be considered them murders “although not in
the first degree."

l, as a member of the Student Mobilization Committee believe,
therefore, that the most effective way to fight repression, to prevrnt
another Kent Stale, and to bring the war in lndochina to an
immediate end, is to create a democraticaily organized inoVemi-nt to
build for mass mobilizations that will ultimately unite the
majority.

Trustees liaise State University Tiiiiion lidte

by Terry Wolf

Beginning next September tui—
tion fees will be increased
throughout the State UniVersity
system. The Board of Trustees
unanimously approved the raise at
a meeting in New York City on
Wednesday, January 27th.

The changes in tuition will be
according to the following sch-
edule: for in-state undergraduates
tuition will be $550, an increase
of $150,
graduates an increase of $300 will
bring tuition up to $900, in-statc

for out-of-sta to under

rise of $200, while out-of-stnte
graduate students will be charged
$1.000. For the medical, law and
dentistry programs, in-state stu-
dents will be faced with an in-
crease of $200 making the tuition
$1,000 while out-of-state students
will pay $1,200, an increase of
$200. Room and board rates will
remain stable.

The action is accompanied by a
resolution to seek legislation to
increase beneﬁts provided under
the State University Scholarship
Program in order to reduce the
impact on students from low and

graduate students will pay $800, a middle income families.

Chancellor Boyer stated that an
increase in tuition—the first since
1963- is essential if the Uni-
versity is to provide places for
many additional New York State
students who will be seeking ad-
mission to the University in the
years immediately ahead. He con-
tinued that the increase will add
$400 million to the state uni-
versity‘s construction fund to
finance current projects and to
realize 262 planned projects.

Under the tuition plan, students
from families with net incomes
less than $2,000 would pay no

tuition, students whose families

earn between $2,000 and $6,000
would pay $100 and students
from families with incomes be-
tween $6,000 and $8,000 would
pay the current $22 per credit fee.

Tuition will not. be affected at
the community colleges. Local
governing boards set; these tuition
fees.

“With the generous scholarship
program, no needy student will be
denied the opportunity of study
because of financial hardship,“
Chancellor Boyer affirmed. The
increase, he felt, was necessary for
SUNY's policy of providing "low-
cost higher education."

As of lint September, 155,469
students were enrolled in the
State University system, an in-
crease of 84,198 students in seven
years. Estimates predict an enroll-
ment of 299,000 students by
1975.

Boyer also noted that the some
factors which necessitate tuition
increases next fall can be expected
to continue their yearly upward
spiral in the coming years.

As a result, and assuming that
current projections hold, a similar
increase in tuition, effective
September 1973, has been pro-
posed by the Trustees.

lll7l.

The probability of having en-
vironmental courses in the fall in
view of the recent. state budgetary
freeze was questioned. Benczct
and McLaren noted that the area
of study could probably be sup-
ported

by private funding and

grantsmanship.

And so for these students and
many oilieis like them the price
of education goes up. Those
undergraduate students who are
state residents will be paying an
additional SISO il year starting
in the Fall. Out-of-stutc under-
graduates will be paying an ad-
ditional $300 a year.
