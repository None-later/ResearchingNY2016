W
Accuses Jews of Inactwn

by Robert Schwartz

Before an overﬂow crowd Mon-
day night at Congregational Sons
of Abraham, the flamboyant lead-
er of the Jewish Defense League,
Rabbi Meir Kahane bitterly ac-
cused the “Jewish Establishment"
of inaction towards saving the 3%
million Jews of the Soviet Union.

Claiming thtit there is no differ-
ence between the cultural geno-
cide in the USSR and the physical
genocide committed by the Nazis,
Rabbi Kahrine declared that the
Soviet Jewry problem is a “prob-
lem in conscience“ for American
Jews.

Rabbi Kahane harsth con-
demned the leaders of the so
called "Jewish Establishment"who
during World War 2, because of
far of losing their “respect-
ability” and of initiating outbursts
of anti-Semitism in America,
failed to confront President
RooseVelt when he refused their
pleas to bomb out the railroads
leading to the concentration
camps at. Auschwitz. Accusing the
“Jewish Establishment" of using
the same arguments today,

cStudent “Discount 

IT'S WHAT YOU GET!)

 

Kahane stated "that from 1917 to
1964 our Jewish establishment
did not hold one street protest for
Soviet Jewry.”

Declaring that the Black leader-
ship of the Civil Rights Movement
of the early 1960's, to its credit,
used “disrespeetable channels
when they had to," Kahane as-
serted that Jews must stop simply
protesting to other Jews .by
preaching sermons and writing
pamphlets on the plight of SOVIeI.
Jewry. Appealing primarily to the
youth in the audience, Kahane
said that any Jew not serious
enough to protect Soviet Jewry
and who "cops out" by attending
2 demonstrations, "ought to be
ashamed" and emotionally
pleaded that its “about time Jews
learned to march for Jews."

Kahane then went to discuss his
contrtiVersial Jewish Defense
League. Stating that the 2 basic
axioms of the JDL are a Jew's
love for his fellow Jews and

.secondly "Jewish pride," he de-
clared that all Jews have an obliga-
tion to feel the pain and sufferings
of their fellow Jews and do “what
must be done" to save them.

Strongly asserting that “We Jews

have had enough of one way
violence," Kahane went on to add
that Jewish pride demands that
Jews fight back when attacked,
“We’re out to change an image,
the image of the Jew as a patsie
you push around" declared
Kahane who told of how Moses
upon seeing an Egyptian smite a
Jew, “didn't forma committee in
study the root causes of Egyptian
Anti-Semitism“ but instead smote
the Egyptian. He added “the fact
of the matter is that violence may
always be a bad thing but is
sometimes necessary."

Kahane felt that the JDL could
credit itself for bringing about the
“radicalization of Jewish youth”
during the past year. Declaring
that previously alienated Jewiin
youths whose past heroes were
"Che, Mao, or Hu” want a Jewish
cause if only someone could pro-
vide them with one, he stated that
“the explosion of youth to JDL
has been tremendous," including
the “remarkable number who
have come out of the New Left."
He added that groups such as the
American Jewish Congress and the
B'nai Brith have no youth. Later
in the evening several young peri-
ple asked Kahane about the pos
sibility of starting a JDL chapter
in Albany.

Rabbi Kahane ended his speech
by calling upon the Jewish youth
of Albany to set the lead for lllt'
adults to follow by holding :I sit in
tin the steps of the Slate ('apitol
and demanding that Gov Rocki-
feller send President Nixon a tr-lr
gram urging him to take drastic
action to free Soviet Jewry.

In a question and nnswr-r period
following his speech. Knhzine
boasted that the JDL could cri-dtt
itself for bringing the prttl)l('ltl of
Soviet Jewry from pagi- It) to
page 1 of the papers, anti that tlu-
JDL and not the speeches of
world leaders saVI-d the Iivus of 2
Soviet Jews condemned to tIt'ulll
in Russia for hyjacking. lle fle
that militant groups are forcing
moderate groups “to do llttttL's
they wouldn't normally do."

Kahane explained that lllt' JDI.
intended to raise so much Il'tllllllt‘
for the US, and Russia In llll.\

would be pressured into t'tin

NY Panel Advises
Drug Law Change

by Bruce B. Dedefsen
Associated Press Writer

A special state study panel recommended to Gov. Rockefeller
Monday that New York reduce the penalties for the possession and
use of marijuana, especially for first offenders caught with small
quantities of the drug.

Assemblyman Chester R. Hardt, chairman of the Temporary State
Commission to Evaluate the Drug Laws, said the panel favored making
finer distinctions between types of offenses as a way of creating a law
that is reasonable and enforceable.

“The simple fact is," Hardt maintained, “that our present maximum
of ID years in jail, equally applicable to the person who gives one puff
of a marijuana cigarette to a roommate or friend as it is to the seller of
huge quantities, is an unrealistic and poorly conceiVed law.“

The commission proposer] a new range of penalties, beginng with a
maximum of If) days' imprisonment for possession and use of the
smallest specified quaiitity—one-quarter ounce—mp to a maximum of
seven years for possession of 16 ounces of marijuana.

As things now stand, I-lardt. said, possession of even one "joint" of
marijuana is a criminal misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in
jail.

Such a system, he added, is “so out of line with all other purely
private disobedienees of the law that law enforcement officers
testified repeatedly that the law was often not enforced, and
psychiatrists testified to the effect that this non-enforcement policy
had on breeding contempt among our young people."

III addition to revising penalties, the commission recommended
making po. sitin of the quarter ounce of marijuana for purely
personal use a violation for the first offense, rather than a
misdemeanor. ’l‘liiII, I‘Iardt said, would “remove the stigma attached to
a person because of his conviction fora ‘criIne.’ “

Mlll‘t'ttvt't', n speeial procedure would be set up so that first offenders
not charged with a felony could have their prosecution deferred and,
after meeting conditions specified by a judge, could have their cases

 

dismissed.

Dissenting Member

A member of the 'I‘emporai'y State Commission to Evaluate the
Drug Laws said Tuesday he would contest the commission‘s concluA
sirin that possession of marijuana should be considered a minor
offense.

Sen John It. Dunne, ll-(iui'dcn (Tity, said he would propose
legislation “which will realistically llit't’l the trtlc dangers which the
use of niarIjIIniia poses to society and its individual members."

Dunne said the suIii-oiiimitlet- found that marijuana would inhibit an
indivnluiil's ability adjust to a complex society, would lead to “a
dropping out or turning off from society,“ and would lend to use of
other drugs.
