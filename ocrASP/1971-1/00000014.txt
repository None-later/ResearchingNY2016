Don Ellis At the Fillmore(Co-
Iumbia G 20343)—’l‘his album is
absolutely smashing as David
Frost-would say. I don’t know
what lasting value Ellis' music
may have (though I believe it will
be considerable), but it is, for the
moment anyway, both highly
challenging, immenser surprising,
and surging with newness (not
novelty). Ellis, as an arranger and
writer draws upon Indian music,
rock, jazz, classical music, and his
own highly inventive mind. His
use of understatement and over-
statement injuxtaposition, as in
the opening “Final Analysis," is
not only attractive, but inspiring
and sometimes actually chilling.

His compositions always use
very tasty, slightly mind-bending
sonorities that make every note
worth listening to. “The Blues" a
humorous springboard for Ellis'
trumpet, and “Salvatore Sam" are
good examples of that.

His use of electronics is equiva~
lent in quality and experimenta-
tion to any rock group, although
he gets carried away a bit on “Hey
Jude" where his irrepressible, in-
ane sense of humor intrudes

One cannot talk about Ellis
without mentioning the key Word
-excitement. He is totally com-
mitted to excitement, both in
furious and in more subtle ways.
They are stuffed into more than
85 minutes on this double album
making it probably the most
worthwhile purchase today bOLh
economically and musicallY~

Bessie Smith, Any Woman's
Blues—It is just about consensus
that Bessie Smith was the most
important blues singer ever. It is

as simple as that.

This album is an absolute must
for blues fans who want to know
from whence it all came. Bessie
Smith sang it all-straight from the
heart, wasting no time on contri-
vances and if one can look past
the obvious old timeness of the
album they will be able to get a
glimpse of greatness. 'l‘he inclu—
sion of solos by guitarist Eddie
Lang, and the legendary pianist
James P. Johnson, are a welcome
addition.

Johnny Smith-t—Kaleidoscope
(Verve V6-8737). This album be-
gins promisineg by swinging
loosely on the old hit "Walk
Don‘t Run," but the promise is
not completely fulfilled. Smith
has been around tl while, but has
recorded rarely of late.

His side men are reputable-‘
Hank Jones , piano; George Duvi-
vier, bass; Don Lamond, drums.
But they rarely have a chance to
stretch out, with the exceptions
of the languid “Old Folks" which
spotlights some nice piano, and
guitar solos and some thoughtful
drumming, “Days of Wine and
Roses" which is given II bossa
nova treatment, an uptempo
“Sweet Lorraine“ and lllt' Bra~
zilian "Choro da Saudatli-" which
has some interesting piantrguitar
interplay,

Both Jones and Smith can be
masterful improviscrs as is evident
on a couple of the tracks, but this
album is too subdued to tliorv
oughly highlight either. It is how-
ever, u peaceful record, and makes
for lllCl‘ background mood music,
and there are some good jam.

By Tom Quigley

Film viewing this year has been
rather dismal to say the least.
There are always a few notable
exceptions however, and this “top
ten" list has been constructed
with the full knowledge that
almost everyone will disagree with
it and me. A few of the ﬁlms
mentioned have not appeared in
local theatres, as of this writing,
and will receive larger reviews
when they are exhibited.

i) FIVE EASY PIECES-— The
brilliant Jack Nicholson and the
EASY RIDER crew have con-
structed a moving and humane
film about alienation and the con-
sequences of living a life. The
supporting performances are su-
perb and Laszlo Kovac's photo-
graphy is beautiful in its evocation
of the emptiness of a loveless soul.

'2.) LITTLE BIG MAN—- Arthur
Penn's latest foray into history as
legend, stars Dustin Hoffman as
the |‘.Zl year old survivor of the
LIHIL‘ Big Horn Mu“acrc. Hoff-
man does an exhaustive job as old
Jack Crabb. Chief Dan George, as
Old Lodge Skins, gives a humor-
ous, quiel dignity to the role as
chief of the “human licings."

II) TIIE PASSION OF ANNA;
The exquisitely photographed Ing-
mar Bergman film concerns the
nature of self deception and the
passionlcss sterility of modern re-

Iationships. Max Von Sydow and
Liv Ullman give consumated per-
formances as the liars. Cinemato-
grapher Sven Nukvist uses light
and color for incredibly chilling
and poetic effects.

4) M*A*S"H*— Robert Altman
and Ring Larder Jr.‘s satire of
battlefront madness makes for the
most hilarious, bloodcurdling,
antiwar, pro-life satire of the year.
Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould,
and a lunatic cast slash down the
culture of death's most sacred
cows with murderous accuracy.

5) HUSBANDS“ John Cassa-
vettes directed and stars with Ben
Gazznra and Peter Falk in a scath—
ing, frequently hilarious comedy
about life, love, and death. The
performances are fantastic and, as
always, director Cassavettes‘ lion-
est presentation of his personal
visions are somehow always ap-
plicable to our own lives.

6) THE VIRGIN AND THE
UYPSY— To some, this film was
merely diluted D. H. Lawrence
However this sensitive cinematic
treatment is notable for its sim-
plicity in the presentation of its
romantic-erotic theme, The deli-
cute photography coupled with
Christopher Miles unobtrusive di-
rection is remarkably subtle. The
performances of Joanna Shimkus
and Franco Nero are intense and
passionate.

Black Ensemble

Announces

by Robin Sagoii

On Wednesday, February 10,
SUNYA's Black Ensemble Per-
forming Arts Company will pre-
sent its first offering of the year,
John Pepper Clark‘s verso-play,
“Song of A Goat."

Founded in HIGH to provide
cultural release for the Black tini-
vcrsity community, the Black En-
semble is presently under the di-
rection of its president, Millege
Mosley, It has presented such

works as. “We Righteous
Bombers," “The Family Meet-
ing," and “The Association,"

plays which liavr- dealt primarily
with I'Ill‘t‘ and revolution. In
"Song of a limit," the Ensoiiiblu
has (Il‘pilt‘lt'd from this Ihcnii- and
is presenting llll' university coni-
iiiuiiity Willi il play that deals \Vllll
African l'lllltll'ill traditions.

Program

“Song of A Goat"‘s rehearsal
schedule has involved a group of
relatively untrained State students
in four weeks of intensiVE produc-
tion. The plziy‘s message, aside
from having meaning for the
Black community, in presenting
an example of African folklore
and traditions, is one of human
relations and communications
which can appeal to all peoples,

Millage happily predicts a bright
future for the Black Ensemble, as
each year it attracts new and
talented people, keeping a con-
tinual flow of new political and
social philosophies within the
group.

“Song of A Goat" runs Wednes-
day through Sunday, February

7) LOVERS AND OTHER
STRANGERS~ So what's the
story? The story is a devastating
comedy that takes a straightfor-
ward stab at the institutions or
marriage and love. An outstanding
cast headed by Gig Young. Anne
Men”, and Harry Guardino, to
name a few, are outrageously fun-
ny. The film gives mature screen
comedy the needed boost of genu-
ine human warmth and sentiment,
a quality sorely lacking in many
recent comedies.

8) PATTON- An old fashion
film biography that, for a change,
tells the story of a major historical
figure with candor and honesty
instead of a glossy whitewash.
George C. Scott is superb as the
gutsy, complex, pistol packing
Putton. The Iilm is far abch the
usual “pro” and "anti" war films
in character study and execution.

9) ZABRISKIE POINT~ This
greatly abused and misunderstood
film brought down the rancor of
almost everyone. Yet, I I)(.'III‘VII‘
Michelangelo Antonioni has as
sembled a far more penetrating
and aesthetically Valid View of
America than all of theI other
youth-oriented trash combined
Antonioni‘s film is complimented
by marvelous cinematography and
illustrates his hopeful vision of lift-
and lova struggling to stay alive in
a stifling atmosphere of llllllll'r'
ance and social stagnation. A
rather unusual and refreshing film
from a usually very pessimistic
artist.

10) FELLINI SATYRICON
Phallic Fellini casts an ambivalent
eye upon the dcbauclierics and
bizarre life situations of per
Christian Rome. This film is a
disjointed, adolescent wet dream
but its uncompromising director's
vision, of human and cultural (ll'
gradation, is hellish aan hilarious,
Certainly nowhere near his lit-st
work but a far more imaginatiw-
analysis of morality than many of
this year's exploitation films.
