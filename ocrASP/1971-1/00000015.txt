Fines

Mr. Ashton. the Library Direc-
tor. has this to say about lines:
“I'm against fines. except punitiVe
lines... These (two cents per day)
fines aren't punitive, they're just
piddling fines."

lf Mr. Ashton had his way (and
he doesn‘t). there would be no
line for a book kept overdue
unless another student requested
it; in this case. the student who
had the book would be called and
given three days to return it, after
which he would be charged 50
cents a day for the overdue book.
Mr. Ashton does not have his way
because all ﬁnes paid to the
library go to the General Fund of

Xerox Copying

The library does not run (Le.
collect money from) the copying
machines; this service is per-
formed by the Faculty-Student
Association, a campus-wide busi-
ness conCern which liberates facul-
ty and students from their
finances.

Actual cost of copying one page
is 31/2 cents. FSA recently granted
the library's request to lower the
copying charge for students. so
the present lO-cent charge will be
reduced.as of February 1. to 5
cents.

the State of New York. which
hands out money to all state
institutions. In other words. a
student who pays money on an
overdue book may very well be
helping out a welfare client in
Brooklyn. but he is not helping
out the library. To change this
policy would requre a petition to
the Senate Library Council and to
the Central Ofﬁce of the State
University System; alot of red
tape for ii piddling fine.

All students still harboring legiti-
mate grudge» against the library's
fine system are requested to get a
job.

Students who search in vain for
periodicals (also known as “maga-
zines") will not be surprised to
learn that the library's ample sup-
ply is usually scattered about the
library. the podium. and the
qtiiidraiigles. One analyst of the
situation stated that the hiring of

 

IBM Printout

one librarian for every magalinc
in the library would probably
solve the problem. Until then.
students can only put the maga-
zines they do find back where
they were found.

Mr. Ashton stated that by next
year one of the rooms in the
library basement will have been
renovated into a “browsing room"
stocked with current periodicals

Finding Books

The Albany Statv University [.1
brary uses the Library of (‘oiigri-ss
Catalogue System. as opposed to
the Dewey Decimal System. lic-
cause the former method is gi-ari-d
for large collections, Unfortu-
natcly. the Library of Congress
System is most useful in in Mosul
stack library. where books an-
accessible only to qualified per
sonnel who can find them for llll'
library users and. more impor-
tantly. who know where to put
them back. There is not a shelf in
the Albany library without a nus
placed book on it. and the illllll'lll
staff is insufficient to liillltllU llll'
mix-ups. Books left in tlii~ bins on
every floor will be put back on
the shelves within a day after lllt'lt'
use. but those put back in llll'
wrong place by studans an- .is
good as lost.

An lBM printout, resembling in
size a softcovcrcd World Book
Encyclopedia. lists all books
which iire checked out of Mir
libriiry. on reserve. or missing. The
printout is updated cvvrv morn
"IE. and copies are available for use
at the circulation (leak and refer
ence desk.

 

 

 
     
    

    

Dozen Facts We 11 Knowing About the

Room to Move

Library sections often look like
they've been set up the week
before. and for some parts of the
library this is not far from true.
Thelibrary is acquiring new books
at a very rapid rate. and, sinca
the purchasing of new processing
equipment. is placing new acquisi-
tions on the shelves much faster.
(Check with a librarian to find
these new books). Reshuffling of
some sections and overcrowding
of others has resulted from a
serious lack of space to put things.

The library basement now
houses several “tenants”: the
School 01 Criminal Justice. the
EOP offices. Community Services.
University College, and the School
of Library Science. Offices origin-
ally built for library usv had to be
turned over to these other usscn~
tial campus organizations until
they could find suitabli- spam-
elsewhere.

The University rui‘cnlly I'l'llll'll a
large suction of the l’it'olli- Build-
ing (in Western Avenue near thi-
campus; some of lllt‘ alich orgaiir
zatioiis (not lCOl’ or University
College) may move Ihcre by next
year. and funds for library renova-
tion already approved in the state
budget will be used to place books
and periodicals in these basement
rooms.

Sleeping

Couches in the library provide
approximately 60% of the space
required for sleeping; the cushion-
ed chairs supply 26'/a%. and the
study booths only 13%, as most
students are too lazy to clear off
the table tops. Library officials
offered no comment on the hem
places to sleep or on what amount
is good for you.

Checking Out

ll lql\ It! “till i it; i

 

 

Mr. Ashton says about the poli»
cy of checking students as they
leave the library. “from a public
relations point of view. it isn‘t
worth a damn."

However. book.pi|fcring remains
a problem; even more books
would leave the library if some
sort of check weren't used.

It will be noted that me present
method still leaves much to the
student's own integrity. (See
photo). Strictcr systems. such as
turnstiles iit the front exit or
security guards posted around the
building. would be oppresive and
would probably present iidesir-
able challenge to those who have
so far found it dull to steal books.
