   Fighting Irish 1-12"

 

’tiAtir rrririi DOWN BUFFALO, 76-61

After twelve unsuccessful er.-
wmpts, the Albany State basket-
ball team ﬁnally put. together a
victory over Buffalo University,
with a 76-61 win here Wednesday
night.

Coach Sauers gave junior Don
.1055 his ﬁrst. starting assignment,
saving Steve Sheehan for added
reserVe strength. Otherwise, there
was no major change in the State
strategy. Defensively Doc used the
zone press right away, employing
if off and on throughout.

Turnovers gave the Danes early
opportunities to crack open it
sizeable lead, but. they were un-
able to convert on many of them
and the score remained very close.
The lead changed hands nine
times in the first half. Towardth
end of the half, the lead was

traded six times within two min-
utes. Albany's Jack Jordan threw
in four straight points to end the
first. half with the Sauersmen on
top, 37-36.

The Bulls scored on the first
play of the second half to grab the
lead by one, but. the Danes
stormed down the floor and put. it
hoop through to give themselves a
lead that. they never let go of.

An eight point tear ﬁnally
opened up a 56-48 lead for Stair.-
with nine minutes remaining. Buf-
falo came right back with six
straight to them behind by only
two, 56-54. After a Sauers time
out, the Great. Danes erabbed the
momentum once more. A goal
tended layup by Jim Musterson
furnished ti nine point spread for
State, (5-1-55, with fivo minutes to
igo.

Matmen Take Two

by Dave Fink

It seems as if the advent. of the
new year has brought with it the
renaissance of the Albany Varsity
Wrestling Team.

Over the past. six days, the Dam-
Grapplers have scored twu consec-
utive and extremely impressive
29-10 and 27-111 victories, over
Williams College and Fairleigh
Dickinson University, respec-
tively, something which Coach
Joe Garcia‘s squad has not been
tible to manage In it long time.

Tri-cripttiins Jeff Albrecht, Jim
Nightingale and Pltii Mints have,
according to Garcia, “been doing
one hell of a job," not only as far
as wrestling is concerned, but
more importantly, iii terms of the
leadership aspect of the sport.
They have stimulated interest and
worked with their teammates in
improving the various skills in-
volved.

Over the semester break, several
members of the team computed in
tournamean tit (LW. Post anti

Thus far, the comb can't say
enough for his squad. A fine
example is liuil, who had to leave
the team, but upon learning that
this would create a vacancy in his
weight Class, came back to pin his
FDU opponent. Litt'l. also had a

Garcia in be the most improved

With the score 64-57, John
Quattrochi brought the crowd to
its feet. with a steal at mtdcourf.
and a driving layup on which he
was fouled. John's three point
maneuver brought Doc up out. of
his seat, arms raised and flats
clenched, a sight. Albany State
fans haven’t. been treated to since
the unforgettable LeMoyne game
of 1969. It gave the Danes a ten
point bulge, 67—57, with 3:53 to
go. They then set. themselves to
some poised time killing, and re-
mained in command until the
final buzzer.

Without it doubt one of the
biggest factors was the Danes'
sharp foul shooting. The Stiuers-
men madc- goud on 30 of the 34
attempts.

There will be a meeting for all

Varsity baseball players are re-

Another decisive factor was the
matter of turnovers. Albany’s ten-
ecious pressing caused 18 costly

guilty of only seven.

The attack was its usual, very
well balanced. High point man
