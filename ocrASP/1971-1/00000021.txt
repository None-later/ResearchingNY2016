DANES TOP POTSDAM, 69-58

by Dick Sexton

On Saturday night, the Albany
State varsity basketball team met
the Potsdam Bears at the Albany
gym, with the ﬁnal score showing
the Danes on top, 69-58.

For the second successive game,
Don Joss was given the nod to
start by Coach Sauers. Steve
Sheehan was saved for some
added strength in the second half.
The other four starters were the
regulars, John Quattrocchi, Al
Reid, Jack Jordan, and Jim Mas-
terson.

The story of the first half can be
described very simply. The strong
jump-shooting of senior AI Reid
and a tight zone defense set the
pace for the game. Potsdam em.
ploycd a zone defense which
forced the Dane live to take long
outside shots, but, it wasn’t suc-
cessful, owing to the accuracy of

Reid and Masterson. Reid from
the corners and Masterson from
the key area kept Albany in the
game. They had 14 and 8 points
respectively in the first half.

With seven minutes remaining in
the half, Coach Sauers had his
men start a sort of weave which
wasted some time and also forced
the Bears into defensive mistakes.

Dane defense, as usual, was tight
and strong. It closed up the shoot-
ing and passing lanes and kept
Albany ahead till the half ended.
The score, at the half was 31-30.

A strong, balanced offense and
the same tight defense character-
ized the second half. Some slick
passing and timely steals by back'
couriers Masterson and Quat-
trocchi enabled the Danes to
achieve an eight point lead mid-
way through the second half.

Doc opened the second half
with the same starting five. After

a few minutes into the half, Steve
Sheehan replaced Don Jess and
contributed a strong offensive as
well as defensive effort.

With seventeen minutes remain-
ing in the game, Reid committed
his fourth personal foul and was
replaced by Werner Kolln, who
helped with some good defense as
well as contributing a pair of
baskets to the score.

Jim Masterson had one of his
better nights against the Bears,
scoring well over his season aver-
age. His long outside shots forced
the Bear zone defense to open up.
This permitted Steve Sheehan and
Werner Kolln to trike the driving
lay-ups.

Dave Welchons also played an
important role in the victory. His
good floor game with John Quat‘
trocchi enabled the Danes to stall
and ice their lead.

the game was Albany's rebound-
ing strength, carried over from the
Buffalo game on Wednesday
night. Steve Sheehan, Don Joss,
and Jack Jordan continued to pull
in key rebounds against Potsdam.

They also stayed hot at the foul
line, as the Danes hit 13 for 16.
On Wed. night, they had 30 of 34.

Credit must be given to Coach
Sauers, who has coached the Al-
bany team to thirteen winning
seasons. The entire squad is in
such a very good condition,

through tough daily workouts
that they can sustain such a fast-
moving and tight-pressing game.

Individual point totals were as
follows: Jim Masterson took
game-high honors with 17 points,
Al Reid had 14 points, Steve
Sheehan had 12 points, Jack Jor-
dan 11, and John Quattrocchi 10.
Werner Kolln, Don Jess, and DaVe
Welchons contributed a seven
point effort. The final score was
69-58. Albany‘s record is now
nine victories to five losses.

Women Begin

Hoop

The Women's Basketball Team
will open their home season
against Cobleskill A & T in a
scrimmage match on Thursday,
February 4th, at 7:00 pm. in the
main gym. They are presently
undefeated, having notched vic-
tories in their two previous games,
versus Keuka College and William
Smith College.

According to coach Barbara
Palm the team should be strong
this year with seven returning
players and many promising new-
comers. The returning players in-
clude Susan DelMonte, Brenda
Gates, Beverly Jacomine, Gloria
Mazure, Doreen Richardson,
Susan ’l‘alro, and Mary Wimmer.
The new membersof thusquad are
Geri llass, Christine Kenali, Leslie
King, Maureen Matthews, Terry
Sukala, and Vivian Williams. The
team has been practicing since
early November and is in good
shape and ready to go. They will
be trying to improve on last year‘s
6-3 won-lost record, “11' best in
the team '5 history.

For the second year the wom-
en‘s team will be playing under

Season

new experimental rules. These
rules make the game very similar
to men‘s basketball as there are
only five people on the court at
one time and all players go both
ways as opposed to the official
rules in which six people are on
the court at once and only two
people go both ways, This change
seems to be quite an improvement
to the game especially from a
spectators standpoint since the
spectators seem to enjoy the extra
speed and difficulty of a game in
which all the players have to
know both offense and defense.

Last year the women's games at
Albany had a marked increase in
attendance and the girls hope this
trend will continue.

‘No Spectator ’ Ruling

...potskowskl

Defended by AMIA

Under some persistent pressure
from Central Council, concerning
the “no spectator" rule at AMIA
Basketball games, the Intramural
Office told the ASP its reasons for
such a rule,

According to Michael Yager, Co-
ordinator for Men‘s Intramural
Athletics, the ruling revolves
around a safety factor, “we sim-
ply can't control them; there's
just no place for them“.

The gym is equipped to hold
three games simultanr-ruisly, and
according lo Yagcr, tlu-rc just is
not enough sidelines I'Ulllll to hold

As it stands now, each team is
permitted to bring two persons
not on the team roster, one scorer
and one timer. In addition to the
teams involved in playing the
three games, and their added per-
sonnel, the gym is also cluttered
with the teams scheduled to play
the following games on the same
courts.

spectators“, explains Yager,
“what you get is a snowball ef-
feet."

At the beginning of the season,
several spectator groups offered to
act as ushers and keep things
under control, a suggestion to
which the AMlA office response
was most favorable. However, the
groups making these offers have
not followed through on their
(monuments, and the “no spr-cta»
tor" ruling still prevails.

Promotion night for the Judo
Club fell at the end of last semes- ,
ter and was indeed a success for
most of the participating iudokas
(judo players). Three judoka re-
ceived their brown belts, six re-
ceived their green belts, and
twenty-four received their second
white bells.

Now the State Judo Club can
offer better instruction than ever
before. While it is important to
have a qualified black belt instruc-
tor, much of the instruction
comes from the judoka them-
selves. Our club on campus can
offer both. Chief instructor for
the club is Robert Fountain,
Nidan (2nd degree black belt),
who has had many years of exper-
ience as teaching in other area
colleges.

Equally important is that the
club itself now has many exper-
ienced and knowledgeable judoka.
This is the fifth semester for the
club on campus, and much can be
learned from these players on a
one-to-one basis.

Anyone interested in viewing or
joining the State Judo Club can
come to any meeting on Tuesday
or Thursday evenings at 6:30 PM.
in the wrestling room of the P.E.
building. The club specializes in
Kodokan Judo and is registered
with the United States Judo Fed-
eration. For information, Call
