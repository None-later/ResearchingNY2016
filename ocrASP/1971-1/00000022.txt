Proof

Michael Yager. who runs the AMIA program for
Student Association, has arbitrarily ruled that. for
security reasons, student spectators can no longer
watch their AMIA teams compete. The rest of his
argument appears on page 7 of this paper. His proof
has yet to be submitted to anyone.

This is the actual crux of the matter. One man
running an S.A. group has no right to make a
decision affecting so many. It's a matter for the
elected representatives of the strident body: Central
Council. if and when Mr. Yager demonstrates the
true need for closing the gym to spectators. the gym
will doubtless be closed. Until then, it must remain
open. No minor administrator has a divine power
over Student Association activities.

Should the gentleman concerned elect to ignore
C runcil‘s jurisdiction here. all student monies. botlr
S.A. and F.S.A.. sliouid be withdrawn from the
AMIA program pending full investigation. Any pro-
gram paid for by students. directly or indirectly.
and affecting students. rrrrrst be rrrrder strident
control.

Denial of Civil Liberties
SASU Goes to Court

by BRUCE B. DETLEFSEN
AP Education Writer

 

ALBANY. N.Y. AP~ The Student Association of the State
University SASU brought suit against the university's Board of
Trustees Tuesday. charging that the system‘s rules for maintaining
order on the campus violate student rights.

The legal action seeks to have the SUNY regulations adopted under
a 1969 state law declared unconstitutional and requests it permanent
court injunction to prevent their enforcement.

Rules Result of Henderson Act

Richard A, hippo. a lawyer from Mineola. Long island. who
represents the student organization. told reporters he hoped to
invalidate some provisions of the rules prit into effect at 32
statrvopcratcd campuses as a result of the so Henderson Law. The
measure was designed to prevent campus disorder.

Lippc added that he was not challenging the law itself. but rather
some specific provisions that were adopted by the SUNY trustees
when they complied with the law.

These provisions. the lawyer said. potentially deity “30.000 students
the right. of due process.

Moreover. Lippe maintained. the trustees would get “better coopera»
tion of they adopted regulations that are fair and reasonable."

Four Items “Untenable”

He specifically cited four parts oi the rules that. SASU regarded as
untenable.

One was the authorization of temporary suspension of a student
prior to a hearing by a committee made up of administrators. faculty
and students.

The second. Lippc maintained. was the provision allowing a
president of u SUNY institution to become u “prosecutor and judge"
inasmuch as the administrator could file a charge against. a student
and, after litr- committee hearing, pass final judgment on the case.

He also said the SUNY regulation t iin standard ot'prol‘f to grride
the hearing committee. such as exrsts iii legal requirements that. “a
preponderance of evidence" must be demonstrated to decide on guilt.

Finally. Lippe objected to the provision that says a student's tariurc
to appear at a committee hearing is deemed to demonstrate that the
allegations it“: in fact true.

 

Suit a Coordinated Action
The lawsuit was described at the news conference as the “first
coordinated action by SUNY students to deal with a problem on a
coordinated basis."
SUNY at Albany, while not it dries paying member of SAS Li docs

SI’A “Appalled”

In letters to the Republrean leg-

Robert J. lliirt said the association

 

was “appalled at the request."
which was signed by Nicholas l)
(lamnir-ro. director of the research

“We are greatly disturbed by the

Who Initiated Request?

While the SPA suggested that
the legislative inquiry was stuff
initiated. Cammero told reporters
last week that it was done at the
request of “a number of members
of one house“ of the legislature.
Cammero refused to identify the
lawmakers.

The Oneonta Star newSPllPerr
however. indicated thrit one of
them was Republican Assembly-
man Edwyn E. Mason of Hobart.
Mason told the Associated Press
he was planning to elaborate on
the matter this week.

The request tr) the SUNY
presidents subsequently was re-
t'r-red to the central administration
in Albany.

Legislature Response

Later Monday. the legislature's
lenders indicated that the SPA hrrd
erred in its conclusion that the
inquiry was stuff initiated.

Assembly Speaker Duryeu said
the research ofﬁce was asked by
members of the legislature to "ac-
quire certain information for their
own purposes. As indicated by rm
official of the State University.
‘tlrere is nothing sacred about it

A spokesman for Senate Major-
