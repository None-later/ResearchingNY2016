Burns . Guard Assaulted  v

Two men, possibly students, as-
saulted a young Burns guard on
Colonial Quad during the early
morning hours yesterday, while
attempting to escape after vandal-
izing a vending machine in the

on Colonial Quad

basement of Livingston Tower.
According to security reports,
Peter McMurray discovered the
two men working their way into
the vending machine with a ham-
mer and screwdriver at approxim-

ately 1 am. yesterday; he did not
have time to call for help, but
instead ordered the men to pre-
sent their I.D.’s and stand against
the wall. They knocked the guard
down, using their tools as wea-
, pans, and ran past him through a

enough to tackle one of them on

Media Minor;
Possible Jobs

by Martha Natltaitsott

Possibilities of creating a second
field sequence in Communications
were discussed Tuesday by the
University Committee oti Com-
munications. A group of related
courses from several different de-
partments was gathered by the
committee, and arrangements for
a minor sequence can be arranged
through the student's major dc-
partment. Courses itt Theater,
Radio, Television and Film, Eng-
lish, Art, Sociology, and Rhetoric
rind Public Address were cited by
the group, these augmented by
graduate level courses in Political
Science and Library Science.

Dr, John Farley, chairman of
the committee and (ll'ill‘l of the
School of Library Science, stig-
gcstcd practical experience in the
communications fir-ids through
work on local daily and weekly
newspapers, and on radio and
ll'lt'VlSlUlt stations, perhaps act-um-

Goals and Responsibilities

Topics for Panel

lite :inswut's to those pressing questions will hr- the primary liISli of llir-
(fluint-t-ilor's Panel on Univvrsily Purposes.

This panel, originally conceived by former (‘qutt-i-llor Gould iii
January of IEI70, is designed “as a means of bringing together many
successful persons of varied backgrounds to lwlp identify future goals
of the State University" and is composed of University
personnel--adminisl.rators, faculty, and stutlertls--tts well as lay citizens
of diverse interests.

At the panel's first nteeling of this academic year. on October 5,
dost'ussion was confined to the issue of changing educational mandate.
The meetings featured speaker Dl‘. Clark Kerr, head of the Caritagie
Commission for the Future of Higher Education. In addressing the
panel, he stated that the nation must begin to view education as its
highest priority if we are “to move forward as ll nation with greater
justice and with progress for all otir people."

Consideration must also be given, be continued, to the desirability
of open access to college education and the attendant need to reduce
the number of years of sludy required fora collegi- diploma. To meet
rising cullng crisis and an ovur-expttnding student population, Dr.
Kcrr called for the creation of a comprehensive community college
program.

University Chancellor Ernest L. Boyer, iii his address. to the panel,
described the panel's central task to be the finding of ii way “to weld
together our best imaginations and our most profouan experience."
He reminded the panel of its original charge: “more anticipatory
adttiittistration so that the State University can get on top of change,"
and concluded that “the prospects for great acctimphisltments lll'l‘
vary brigltt indeed.“

Soldiers

On Laotian Border

by Robert Tuckman
Associated Press Writer

SAIGON AP — A force of
20,000 Saigon troops, backed by
9,000 Americans, has pushed up
to the Laotian border iwth scant
opposition as part of a new allied
drive against enemy forces.

Both General Creighton W.
Abrams aitd the White House left
the world command said a deci-
sion oit further action was up to
the White House, which in turn
refused to project future move-
ments.

The drive, shaping tip into one
of the biggest of the war, was
made undccover of a news black-
out which blanketed the north-
wust corner of Soutlt Vietnam for
six (lays. This was lifted Thursday.

The offensch was part of ti
massivu two-prongcd sweep of
nearly 50,000 allied troops tid-
vancing under an umbrella of
American and Vietnamese bomb-
ers anti helicopter guttsltips. To
the south, the second push by
close lo 20,000 South Vietnamese
troops has driven deeper into
Cambodia. They also fit" into
minor opposition.

tier was aimed at smashing a
reported new enemy buildup. It
was also designed to plug the
outlets of the Ho Chi Minh trail
through which enemy men and
materiel funnel into South Viet-

nam.

The 20,000 South Vietnamese
troops deployed on the Laotian
frontier were supported by about
9,000 Americans who moved into
such key frontier bases as Khe
Sang and Lang Vei, both scenes of
heavy fighting earlier in the war.

There are no ARVN-Army of
Republic of Vietnam- troops in
Laos," said Saigon's chief military
spokesman.

US. officials said the northwest
sector operation was undertaken
to help insure the safety of Ameri-
can forces being pulled out of
Vietnam and leave the way secure
for continued withdrawal.

President Nixon is expected to
announce in April furtltcr with-
drawals beyond the current pro-
gram that will lower American
troop strength to 284,000 by May
l. The total is 3'35 000 now.

Some obsc‘ also saw the
push as an effort to keep the
North Vietnamese from mounting
dry season ril'l'ensives, by blocking
lIti' Ho Chi Minh trail and thus
preventing troop and supply
liuilrlups in South Vietnam and
Cambodia.

Coupled with the Soitllt Viol-
nantese (lrivr- into the Cambodian
sanctuaries; area, the two offen-
sivvs would, if successful, roll
brick the North Vicltttimese
forces.

The lwo-fronl campaign also re-
l'let-ls llll' continuing American
effort to turn tii't'l‘ fighting to the
South Vietnamese.

Although U.S. officials have re-
poi'letl ii North Vietnamch build
up in the northern sector, it has
not been uncovered st) far.
