to anybody until after he was
elected. Then he had to think of
one...fast. It took him three
months. He called it I‘Vietnamiza-
tion."

"Vietnamization” is a lovely lit-
tle word because it means so
many things to so many different
people. To Richard M.Nixon, it
means “re-election." To suburban
liberals, it means "security." To
college students, it means lower
draft calls every October and No‘
chbcr. To the poor, it menus
“benign neglect," which is Nixon-
csc for “starvation.”

However, for soldiers in Viet-

four brazen upstarts got in the
way of the bullets and before you
could say “Boston Massacre,"
blood was staining the pavement.

All the other college students
across the country became so
morally outraged at this that they
went on strike, shut down the
universities in protest, went home,
and cornered the summer job mar-
ket.

It was decided, meanwhile, that
an explanation was needed. A
grand jury was convened. They
decided the guard was blameless
since they only fired the guns that
had killed the people. The real

Second, you centralized your
files on suspected activists. You
monitored peace candidates. You
published blacklists of “radical
speakers." You increased wiretap-
ping, kept people in jail under
preventive detention, and passed
noknock laws. This, too, is called
“law and order."

Then, you have your Vice-Pres-
ident say bad things about the
liberal media. They respond by
thinking about “threatened cen-
corship" and so stories of political
repression barely appeared in the
papers. This is called "intimida-
tion."

However, we must face the real-
ity that migrant farmworkers
must endure the poverty, the
illiteracy, and the degradation in-
herent in the back breaking, mind
dulling agony which is the lot of
these un-organized workers, and
their wives and children. We, the
idealists, seem to have forgotten
those who are struggling for what
is rightfully theirs. The factory
sweatshop is a long discarded an-
achronism in most industries.
Equally archaic, though, is the
inhuman brutal exploitation of
the migrant farmers and their

way.

Last spring, Richard M. Nixon
decided that this secret pliin
wasn't working too well at till. It
was perfectly clear that something
new was needed. So he ordered an
"incursion" into Cambodia.

This means having the C.l.A.
depose the government in power
and replace it with more sympa-

gone.

Of course people began to no»
tice that there was still that nasty
little “police action" going on in
Vietnam. And it was Congres-
sional election time. Richard M,
Nixon came up with secret plan.

First, you let Congress catch
you sending armed iidvisors into

Then you fly aerial support

Finally. the world press catches

imposed a press blackout.
