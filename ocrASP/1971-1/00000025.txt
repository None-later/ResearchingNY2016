1 Ear To The Thunder

by Arlene Scheurer

Sundown by Sundown - Ampex
A-10107 - There is not much bad
about this album, but there is very
little to recommend it. The words
aren’t cliches, but do not say
much, the drummer plods on well
trod ground and both the soloists
and the composition are too pre-
dictable. ‘

There are some happy excep-
tions. such as “Gypsy Woman"
which is a minor .k'e'yich'ar'itwith
some hectic rhythiii; 'tiie'pliiiblive
"My Beautiful Dream" and
Cornelius' inspired guitar on the
Latin ﬂavored “The Devil’s Got
My Soul." “Living In and Out"
changes tempos cleanly. but is
otherwise dull.

The group seems well organized
and capable, but there is too
much better competition for the
mediocre to succeed.

Them Changes by Buddy Miles -
Mercury SR 61280 - This Isa nice
example of good simple pop
music. There is nothing here to
blow your mind or attack your
ears. but it might seduce your feet
into dancing.

None of the musicians on the
date are much better than average.
although Mill's has some powerful
vocals. but the arrangements are
tight and the songs are simple and
so the results are fairly entertain»
log.

The Blood Swoal and 'I‘earshave
had a lot of influence on modern
rock and this album is one of their
manifestations. The use of horns
as both background and solo in-
struments havu added a new
dimension. but also offers pitfalls.

The simplicity of this album is
what is most appealing. althouin

on a simple riff and includes a
short say-nothing guitar solo.

“Nebraska” is basically a jazz
performance and the organ-guitar
combination reminds me a little
of the Wes Montgomery-Jimmy
’Smith collaboration. There is a
rather limpid guitar solo followed
by a much more succinct state-
ment by Lewis. The piece is
wrapped up with Miles trading
fours with the other two. It is his
best drumming on the date, but
he ends all his exchanges with a
one-bar descending paradiddle.

My personal favorite is the
lyrical "I Still Love You." It is
soft and delicate with occassional
appropriate modulated shouts for
effect. It is an excellent singing
effort by the leader.

The lyrics in this album are trite
and the arrangements simple. But
the spirit’s the thing and there is a
good deal of that in this album.

McLemore Avenue by Booker T.
& the M.G.’s - Stax STS-2027 -
Booker T. & the MG‘s is a group
that has been around for a long
time. It consists of technically
able musicians with few or no
ideas of their own. I guess you
could call them the 101 strings of
the soul world.

On this album they play all
Beatle songs and do them well at
that. But like a similar group. the
Ventures. they seem to be a mir-
ror image rather than the real
thing. Perhaps they are just too
slick; perhaps l am just too
haughty.

Cccil Mche is a leader of mod-
ern hiissists and has been since
coming to fame by playing with
the Charles Lloyd quartet.

There are some nice things: the
arrangements of “Come To
gether,” the guitar solo in "Here
Comes the Sun." and of course all
the compositions. (How can you
miss with Beatle notes?)

“Something” is changed a good
deal being transformed from a
ballad to uptempo with an accept-
able guitar sale. In fact the guitar-
ist stands out from the whole

groups being the only one that '

plays anything approaching
memorable. The drummer is stiff
and the organ can‘t escape the use
of mundane chords.

The problem with the album is
that it is so very derivative. So
much so, in fact. that the listener
is left with the feeling he's heard
it all before. It is all easy listening,
too easy.

Salt Of The Earth Presents Social-
gglesOf Miners

miners against the intransigent
mine owners.

The dynamics of the situation

includes not only the fight of the
union against the operators and
some vivid examples of police
brutality, but also the struggle of
the women strikers who demand
participation on an equal basis
with men in the strike activities.
The film was an unusual undertak-
ing, because of its frank focus on
social issues and because over half
cast members were really
miners from the area.
However, before the shooting of
the film could be completed in
1953. the mood of the times
brought the production consider-
able difﬁculty. Representative
Donald Jackson (Rep. Calif.) de-
nounced the film as a “communist
maneuver." Bibermun and Jarrieo
had. after all. been called before
IIUAC a year or so before because
of their “suspectEd afﬁliations
with or knowledge of known
Communists." In addition. the
Miners‘ Union (International
Union of Mine. Mill and Smelter
Workers). a cu-producer of the
film. had been expelled from the
CIO for its “left-wing leanings.
The combination of these factors
made the entire production ii like
ly target for the anti-communist
hysteria of the day.

The leading lady was arrested by
the Federal government for being
an “illegal alien." She was held
despite the absensi- of a concrete
case against her until the film
crew agreed to terminate all film-
ing activities in New Mexico. Be
cause of the hostile publicity the
film was receiving, some residean
of SiIVi-r ('ily felt compelled to
initiate their own Hantl-
cominunist campaign." Vigilante
groups harassed and threatened
the crew and two union balls were
burned to the ground before the
crew folded up and left the area.
