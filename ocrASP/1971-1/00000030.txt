LAOS

After such successes as Vietnam, Cambodia, and
the 1971 elections, what would President Nixon do
for an encore?

The tiny nation of Laos, long the battleground of
Southeast Asia. looks like the next act. It seems
doubtful that Mr. Nixon will send American troops
in; however, it is possible for he never seems to learn.
Instead, we will probably see large numbers of
helpful South Vietnamese troops "aiding" the
Laotians. I’lus large numbers of American Air Force
missions over Laotian territory. And then massive
injections ofjets, guns. ammunition, money....

This successful formula has not worked in China
“945-49), Vietnam (l954-?), and Cambodia
(1970-?) Chances are that it won‘t work in Laos
either. It may. however. set a record of a different
nature. Without American troops. ('hina fell to the
Communists in 4 years, Cambodia is on the verge of
collapse after less than one. Laos may, with enough
Anterican aid. fall to “the enemy" in even less time.

Thus. from a historical standpoint, there is no
solution to the problem. One can trust. however. that
this precedent will not keep Richard Nixon from
doing whatever he and the pentagon see fit to do.

Well. Dick, in case you missed the message the
young people of America sent you last Spring. here it
is again.

We aren't going to let you do it-try us and see.

To the Editor:

This letter is in response to the
one that appeared in the Feb. 5
edition of ASP written by Mr.
John Buttolph, Ill, graduate
advisor. First, I would like to say
that I am a graduate student living
in Brubachcr Hall. Mr. Buttolpb,
III, said that most graduate stu-
dean are quite happy in Bru-
bueher and that we really have not
been shafted as far as living quar-
ters are concerned. This may be
true especially if you disregard the
fact that on the third floor halls.
many of the showers do not work.
On my ball, one comes out scald—
ing and the other freezing. If you
mixed the water we would haVea
happy medium, but then we
would only have one shower for
the hall. Did you ever try to take
a shower before a Saturday night
(late at the same time that six
others were trying to do the same
thing? Please pass the Right
Guard! The halls echo every
sound that you can possibly
make. In fact. someone heard me
typing this at the other end of the
hall and asked me to type lower
(not really but the echo can be
heard up and down the ball).
There is very little protection on
the downtown campus. At any
one time I've only seen one Burns
Guard on duty at night. One
person cannot watch lhis campus.
Cars have had antennas. battcrics
and other things takcn. Wind-
shields have been smashed.
'I‘ownecs throw glass from beer
bottles all over Stale Strut-l Ill
front of Brubacher.

I can understand why Mr. But.-
liilpli. lll said llllll the “total
university experience is just a
cupliamistic rationalization for
the turmoil and lawlessness of a
l‘llllt‘l‘wlppul‘llllllly campus." The
rcason is simply that anyoni- who
ViilI'Il for Buckley would. Win-n
Mr. Ilnllolpli, lll said, "We
wouldn't have ll any other way,
brother." lll' implied that all of
lllt' ﬂl'iltlllllll' students would not
want to lch with undergrads. I
would like to say that the Word
"we" does not includi- myself. I'm
tired of living with people who are
in their twenties and act like
people who are in their Iillt' l'or-
lit-s. l am tired of watching grail
students bct blisters on their asses
because they never move them to
do anything. Sure, we all havn- to
study null" and wc have llltH'I'
work than undergrads. but We do
not study all tlu- l,lllll‘. The time
spent not studying should be llhi'tl
for things lll‘llt'l' than sitting III
the lounge all the time playing
lit-arts. l do not want to make the

int- mistake that Mr. Ilut.lo|pli

' made by including me in his
pronouns. I Would say there is a
substantial minority who art.I not
are I have described above. I will

also say that I have met many
undergrads, Mr. Buttolph. Ill, and
I find them to be intelligent,
aware. courteous, considerate,
fun-loving and studious. Almost
all my friends are undergrads and
to tell you the truth, I would not
want to have it any other way.
When I study I want quiet also,
but when I’m not studying, l like
to have fun and so do they.’Ihey
carry on a conversation just as
well as any grad student I've met.
They are just us aware and they
like to talk about. other things
besides academics.

As far as having to “Live with
them, stand in line with them,
being distracted by them." as Mr.
Buttolph. III, has said, I would
like to comment. You seem to
imply that they are infants, and
that they are scum of the earth. If
they are infants, why can they
vote and "protect" you in Viet
Nam. What are you going to do,
Mr. Buttolph, III, when your own
infant has to have his ass wiped?
Well I would like to live uptown
in a grad dorm. I've had one
college experience at Stony Brook
and having another one at Albany
would be interesting and stimu-
latlng.

This letter will probably give me
many enemies, but since I haven't
gone out of my way to make
friends at Brubacher it does not
make much difference. I only
have one question to ask of the
students in Bru: why have you
lost your youth so quickly?

Undergrads, please DO NOT
leave me alone.

To the Editor:

The letter written by John but-
tolph III (l’rb. 5) concerning grad
uate housing imisl hava been a
satire, but then again I'm afraid bi-
might be serious. John Buttolpb
lIl (lriuluulc Advisor. llru-
hiichcr llall voice of middle
America “tultc what's givr-n and

the content of his letter. Wake up,
John. We all can‘t be as noble as
you. Some of us have that hurnnn
l‘olble of wanting to get what we
pay for r of not ln-ingshitlcd on,

 

 
   
 
    

 

you might say (excuse my vocabu-
l:. y, John). Perhaps traveling on a
bus to and from class is not being
“forced” into a commuter role
after all, you don't have to go to
class (but then again I'm sure you
have a car). The Pierce Hall Resi-
dents loved the idea of moving a
day care center into the basement
of their dorm (or should I say
office building), as was seen by
their “docile and accomodating"
actions of petitioning, talks with
Benezet to a point where only a
lack of funds halted a court in-
junction. A great number ol‘ grad
students loved hassling in Sept.
for unavailable apartments in
Albany due to lack of enough
graduate housing. But, you sure
gave a damn, living in your“hap-
py" state-paid room. Wake up
John. If there is any way grad
students can move among the
undergraduates, I recommend you
be the ﬁrst to go. Although living
with them “would mean eating
with them, standing in line with
them, being assaulted and robbed
by them, and being distracted by
them,“ it may do you some good.
You may learn something.

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1971

by E. F. Shapiro

Much has been said and written
about escape. However much of
the material which has been said
and written has been against it,
stating that escape is not good,
thus Causing guilt feelings in peo-
ple when they do feel that they
are escaping. In this article, I
would like to offer another point
of view.

First of all, we must define what
is meant when we speak of escape
or of escaping. A simple yet work-
able definition of escape could be
that of “leaving reality". That is,
to forget, ignore, or remove one's
self from that which is real.

Much of our time is spent escap-
ing the realities of "life". per so.
When we watch television, (lay-
dream, read a book for pleasure.
get high, get drunk. go to the
movies, etc., etc., we are, for a
time, removing ourselves mentally
from ottr immediate, duy-to-day,
and long range problems. There
are several reasons why escape is
used so often. The most obvious
reason is to remove ourselves
(mentally or sometimes physical-
ly) from a situation or problem
that we cannot cope with. 'l‘hcsc
are the immediate and day-to-day
problems. Upset about school? Go
to a movie and lch someone else's
existence for two-and-a-halt‘
hours. Having hassles with your
boyfriend orgirlfriend'.’ Lose your-
self in a good book. In an uncom-
fortable situation? Leave. Escape.
Forget. Don't think. Escape. It's
easy to do most of the time and
each one of us has developed his
own methods for doing so.

A more subtle but perhaps more
important reason for escaping is
that most of the time we refuse to
accept the reality of our own
existencellThink about it. To ac-
cept the realities of one‘s exist-
enCe is to accept the realities of
ourselves and our environment.
Basically, these realities are: we
will all die sooner or later. we
exist in a world that is quickly
becoming unfit and too crowded
to live in. we cannot really explain
to ourselves why we are bere,therc
is unhappiness everywhere, and
there is not that much that we can
do to change it.

In this and other countries a
new type of escape is taking placi~
among the present generation. airl-
ed by drugs. To attempt to N‘-
plain this typtI of escape, it is
necessary to define the two differ-
ent general forms of escape.

The first and most oflt-n ust-(l
form is that which I will call
“escaping outwardly". This form
includes letting things act upon
oin-‘s sell by forgetting or avoid-
ing unplc' ~ant thoughts and
occurrences, by going to the now

Everyone has his form of escape. Above, we see how the “Average Joe" escapes. Below, the President of
the United States escapes the daily pressures of life with an occasional aerial attack on Hanoi. Lately, he
has found new means of escape in Laos.

ies. reading, or watching televi-
sion. The other form, which has
been used for centuries by philo-
sophers, scientists, and religious
mystics, can be called “escaping
inwardly", that is, by sitting down
and trying to reason out the pur-
pose of our existence in one's own
mind, by asking why. However.
the answers which one comes up
with have only as much reality
and truth in them as the indivi-
dual will accept for himself.

From a general viewpoint, ex-
caping either way is futile. It can
be compared to being trapped in a
train tunnel and have a train
coming towards you at 60 miles
per hour. Whether you turn your
back on the train and run down
the tracks away -forom it. or
whether you run towards it is
irrelevant. You're going to get hit
either way. The question is, which
way is the more self-satisfying of
the two. And so it is with life.

Drugs (by "drugs", I am refer-
ring to the so-ealled “mind-expan-
ding" ones such as marijuana,
hashish, and the hallucinogens)
are often used by people to escape
outwardly, that is. they are taken
to escape the realities of everyday
life. It is an excuse to avoid
thinking, and to let the environ-
ment dictate to the mind, Le.
grooving on music, going to see
Fantasia, etc.

More and more, however, drugs
are being used by people to help
them escape inwardly. to try and
achieve self-understanding, to seek
the “cosmic answers”, to question
their existence and environment,
and to help put things in perspec-
tive. This. I believe, is the more
self-satisfying of the two forms of
escape in that the knowledge that
we are attempting to find the
answers is good,even though we
may realize that the “universal”
answers are not there, and the
most that we can do is find some
personal ones.

In conclusion. I would like to
state that I believe that escaping is
good for the individual as long as
extremes are not reached. Some-
one who escapes totnlly from real-
ity is considered insane in our
society and may end up locked
in a padded cell. On the other
hand. someone who totally acv
ccpts reality as "real", can either
become a cold. hard person, unac-
ceptable to himself and to others.
or may end up next doot to the
total escapist.

Itis tip to each individual to find
his own level of escapism and his
own means of escape. and in this
way reach a compromise with the
realities of life.
