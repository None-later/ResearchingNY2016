SAUERSMEN UP RECORD TO 11-5

With two victories this past
week, the State Varsity Basketball
Team stretched their win-loss
mark to 11-5. The victories came
at the expense of Oneonta College
on Thursday night (73-57) and
Cortland State College on Satur-
day night (78-63).

The Danes had very little trou-
ble at Oneonta, who are usually
tough on their home court. Two
years ago in Oneonta. the Red
Dragons upset Albany. 71-59, in
one of only six losses the Danes
suffered that year.

Thursday night, however, was a
different story. The Sauersmen
ripped open a 12-2 lead right from
the opening tap, and led by eleven
at the half. 37-26. In the second
stanza, the Great Danes broke it
wide open, and led by 20 with
twelve minutes remaining, 54-34.
The fianl was 73-57.

Jack Jordan was the key man
for Albany in the win. The six
foot senior from Green Island
pumped in 25 points, hitting 10
for 19 from the floor. He also
hauled in 15 rebounds.

As a team, the Danes shot fairly

well (29 for 65) from the floor,
and held a sizeable rebound edge,
50-40.

Saturday night the Danes hosted
another Red Dragon team, this
one from Cortland State. It was
one of the very rare times when
Albany was not plagued with a
height disadvantage. A pair of high
scoring guards led the Cortland
offense, both standing only 5‘11".
Cortland‘s rebound leader was a
mere 6’2" and the tallest man on
their roster was just 6'4".

Albany-Cortland games are tra-
ditionally close. Seven of the fif-
teen previous gumes between the
two clubs had been settled by less
than four points, four of these
decided by just one.

The Danes made light work of
the Red Dragons this year how-
ever. Jack Jordan scored only ten
points, about five below his sea-
son's game average. Taking up the
slack, plus some, was John
Quattrochi who poured in his
season's high of 24 points.

The Danes pulled away early on
a ten point tear near the end of
the first half. Al Reid hadllof his
15 points in the first period. and
the score stood at 41-25 at the
intermission.

Again the Danes controlled
the boards. leading this category
by a 45-38 margin., They were a
hot 30 of 59 from the ﬁeld and
coasted to a 78-63 win.

The Albany Netters have now
been successful in seven of their
last eight outings. The only blem-
ish in that streak was an 88-66
home loss at the hands of Marist
College.

The Danes take to the road
again next week. They play at
New Paltz onTuesday and Saturday
they face rival Sienu College on a
neutral court (Mcchanicsville
H.S,).

Their next home game is on
Wednesday, February 17, as the
Danes take on an always powerful
Southern Connecticut squad.

Mermen Drop Two;

More Records Fall

by Linda Meyers

This week the Albany State
Swim Team losl two dual meets,
both to tough opponents. Wednes-
day the team lost to llohart Col-
lege by a score of 71-42, and
Saturday they lost to Oswcgo
ill-42.

The Albany team is nchr with-
out exciting momans‘ howcvur, as
in almost eVery meet this year
they have buttered one of their
own team records. This week was
no exception, for in Wednesday's
meet George Dcmpscy set a new
1,000 yard freestyle record of
12101.“, and in Saturday's meet
Leonard Van Ryn posted a new
record in the 200 yard individual
medley with a time of 2: lG.-l.

The Albany team is still a very
young one, in comparison with
the many well established teams
in the state, but it is evident in
watching their meets and in look-
ing at their records that they are
quite rapidly closing the gap in
terms of experience and in terms
of the quality of their own times.
This year's team consisls of seven
freshmen out of a learn of twelve,
and the rest of the team is com-
posed mostly of sophomores and
juniors. 'l‘hcsc men are gaining in
experience every meet they swim.

The improvmg quality of the
team Is clearly shown in the
amount of time that has been
taken off of many of the team
records. The most striking exam-
ple of this is the 1,000 yard
freestyle record which has gone
from 13:20.2 down to 12201.8 in
just this one season. Other records
which have dropped considerably
this year are the 500 yard free-
style, from 5334.5 to 5238.4; the
200 yard individual medley, from
2:225 to 2:16.:1', and the 200
yard backstroke, from 2:24.!) to
2:16.41.

This Week’s meets were high-
lighted hy the performances of
two of Albany‘s swimmers, fresh-
man Leonard Van Ryn, who won
the 200 yard individual medley
and the 500 yard freestyle in both
the meets and junior George
Dempsey, who set a new Varsin
record in the 1,000 yard freestyle
in Wednesday's meet and won the
even in Snlurday's meet. 'I'husc
pcrl'ornuinci-s are typical of the
way the team is improving I-Vcry
week.

The men will be traveling again
this week to meet I’lattsburg on

The running battle between
AMlA and Central Council over
the “no spectator” ruling at
basketball games, ended last
Thursday night at a Central Coun-
cil meeting. The decision arrived

 

at was that the “no spectator" V

ruling would prevail.

Mr. Michael Ynger, Director of
the Men’s Intramural Program,
was present at the meeting along
with a delegation from the AMIA
Council. Their presence there had
been requested in a bill, passed by
Central Council the previous
Thursday. That Bill, 7071-103,
proposed nullification of the
AMIA “no spectator" ruling and
invited Mr. Yager and his associ-
ates to come to the next Central
Council meeting and explain their
position. ‘

The spokesman for the AMIA
was Al Alcon, who is a Head
Official, Commissioner, player
and student. The defense was the
safety factor involved. Alcon
argued that AMIA was in no way
avorse to [he idea of having spec-
tators at basketball games, but
that they could not be controlled
for there was no place to put
them.

After a one hour discussion the
question was moved and the
AMIA “no spectator” policy was
allowed to stand, by a vote of
20-2-5.
