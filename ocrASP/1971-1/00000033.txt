Autism is an emotional illness about which very

withdrawal from people, resulting in the (.‘l‘lllll's
inability to talk or communicate at all. .

The Society has established a summer camp l()l‘
autistic children called Camp Rainbow. The pro-
ceeds from the Telethon will be used to widen camp
facilities so that more children will be able to attend
the camp for longer periods each summer. The
Camp is designed to give the.chi|(l an expanded
educational and social opportunity. ‘

This year, the Telethon will be held in the newly
decorated Rathskeller. Sorm1 nOlﬂble highlights of

Sales Tax

The Assembly's fiscal committee
is considering a rearrangement of
the sales tax structure that would
take away the power of commun-
ities to impose a local sales tax.

Under the plan, revealed Mon-
dayry Assembly Speaker Perry B.
Dur en, the state sales tax would
be raised to 6 cents a dollar and
this levy would be uniform across
the state.

in other words, a consumer
would pay the same amount of
sales tax anywhere in the state.

The state sales tax now is three
cents a dollar and communities
have the authority to add up to
another three cents in local Stiles
tax. The result has been a patch-
work of differing sales tax levies
among various localities.

Repeal of Blaine Amendment

One proposal W to repeal Lil»
constitutional ban on state aid to
parochial schools 7 has been
abandoned by legislative leaders,
hiin legislative sources said.

Despite public vows by leaders
to repeal the so-callcd Blaine
Amendment, the sources said,
“It's as dead as anything could
he."

Roman Catholic church leaders,
up till this year, iHIVL‘ sought the
repeal, Recently, they dropped
their support of the measure in
favor of appeal for immediate aid.

and Blaine

As a consitutional amendment,
the repeal measure requires pas-
sage by two separately elected
legislatures and then the voters to
become effective. The 1970 legis-
lature passed the measure and the
1971 legislature was scheduled to
endorse the measure again to en-
able the question to be placed on
the November ballot this year for
the decision of the voters. If
passed, there was the possibility
that an aid program for the finan-
cially ailing parochial school sys-
tem would be voted in 1972.

The Roman Catholic bishops
said money was needed now. They
said the restriction has been
eroded by court rulings, so at-
tempts to repeal it would be
meaningless and only delay efforts
to help nonpublic shoots.

Gov. Rockefeller however. won-

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Discussed

dered Monday how the legislature
could aid parochial schools and
still honor the constitutional him.
He said he still supported the
repeal of the Blaine amendment.

With the action on the Blaine
,repealer being held up, the legisla-
ture will try this week for ﬁnal
legislative passage of a constitu-
tional amendment to create ii new
state Department of Criminal Jus»
tice.

The new agency, which the legis-
lature passed last year, was en-
visioned as a device for improving
the state’s crime-fighting efforts.
it would supervise the activities of
district attorneys, sheriffs and lo-
cal police forces. District attor-
neys, among others oppose the
idea.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sell Marijuana Like Liquor ?

NEW YORK Al’ 7 A marijuana
cigarette could be purchased in
the same manner and in the same
store as a New Yorker now buys
liquor, under a law proposed to-
day by a Manhattan state legis»
atoi'.

Assemblyman Franz S. LeichlL-r
announced that he was introdu-
cing a hill to repeal all present
state prohibitions on the posses-
sion of marijuana and to control
its sale the way alcoholic bever-
ages are regulated.

As with liquor. marijuana would
not be sold to persons under Iii
years, Leichter‘s proposed liegi-
slation provides.

“We must recognize that pos»
sibly as many as omI million New
Yorkers use marijuana," the West
Side Democrat said. “The evi-
dence does not show that niari-
juana is harmful," he added.

Leichtcr's bill would establiin a
slate marijuana control authority
to license and regulate growers,
producers, manufacturers and dis-
tribiltors of marijuana.

The authority also would one
force regulations setting the
strength of marijuana sold at retail
and require a warning on any
package or container of marijuana
regarding possible ill effects on
the health of the user.

Leichter said that the strength
of marijuana can be controlled, as
can the alcohol content of liquor.

Marijuana would be sold at. retail

only in licensed liquor stores and
all present rules and regulations
pertaining to such stores and the
supervisory powers of the state
would apply, he said.

Under the proposed legislation,
the marijuana would be taxed and
David Michaels, an attorney assis-
ting Leichlcr, speculated lhal the
drug would be taxed "several
times lhe amount of liquor” *-
providing the slate with a sub-
stantial revenue."

Anthropologist and author Mar-
garet Mead appeared at a news
conference with Leighter to sup-
port the legislation along with lra
Glasser, executive director of the
New York Civil Liberties Union,
and Civil Court Judge Marlin
Sleehcr.

Miss Mead said she supported
the legislation “in the interest of
children and respect for the laws
of lhe country."

The present law, Miss Mead said,
is “unrelated to reality."

"1 do not urge people to smoke
marijuana and the aim of my bill
is not to increase its use," Leich-
ter said. “But since clearly the use
of niarijuna will continue, and in
fact increase, 1 think it is to
society‘s advantage to impose qua-
lity control, to have a system of
distribution which will keep mari-
,uana out of the hands of the
young and to end the hyposcrisy
of permitting the use of more
dangerous substances such as to-
bacco and alcohol while banning
marijuana."

Student Voices Doubt On
Vietnam War Legitimacy

WASHINGTON AP A Stan~
ford UniVersity student accused
Congress today of giving up its
right to declare war and urged the
Senate Armed Services Committee
to approve legislation to aboliin
the drllft.

l’eter Kniltson, chairman of the
Stanford Draft. Repeal Council,
said his draft age friends are fru»
slraled because of being forced to
fight and die in tin undeclared war
in Southeast Asia.

The moral dilemma facing
young men today would be Silnl‘
Iiir to American men having to
fight on line side of Germany in
World War ll, he said.

"if during the course of llie
Second World War, America had
entered on the side of Hitler's
Germany," he asked, “would you
hich allowed yoursulf to lie
drafted? Would you haVe blindly
said my country right or wrong?"

“i hope you can appreciate the
magnitude of that dilemma be
cause that same painful choice
faces millions of Americans to-
day,” he said.

He questioned why the Congress
failed to declare war and risked
rhetorically whether it could be
because a majority felt that the
war wasn‘t “just enough" to war-
rant a declaration.

Knutson made his remarks on
the third day of hearings before
the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee on legislation to end the
draft.
