Miss waters:

I guess you are responsible for
that Fool disguised as a music
critic who calls himself Jeff Ber-
ger. If you want to improve the
quality of your staff then remove
him.

Never before have I read such
poor reviews. From his first article
to his most recent travesty in the
form of a consumer guide and a
Chicago concert review. His con-
cept of criticism is ﬁnding as
many synonyms for “good” or
"bad" as possible. He never
bothers to explain why he quali-
fies the way he does. There is
misinformation galore. His state-
ment about Alvin Lee being his
own greatest influence probably
comes as a result of his own self
confessed ignorance of Black mu.
sic. Black music is the source of
all rock and anyone who doesn't
comprehend the former shouldn't
review the latter.

The Chicago review was more of
the same. More subjective judg-
ments without musical explana-
tions. His writings are no more
than advertising hype and does
not bejong under the heading of
critical evaluation. I really enjoy
reading reviews - you should print
more of them of all kinds ‘ but i
want to know about mUsic, not
the chairs, or the lines, or the cops
or Patti or Ken. You have so
many superior reviewers in all
fields - Roscnblum, Quigley, Grae-
ber, etc. - that it seems a terrible
waste to give so much space to

someone who apparently acquires
all his musical knowledge from

someone.

Pete Jacobs
Dear Pete:

Well, obviously I don‘t think I'm
a fool writing travesties or I
wouldn't keep writing, but thanks
for your opinion. That’s what it
all comes down to, you know--
your letter, my reviews: all opin-
ions, collections of words to ex-
press the way wc feel. of course,
all my reviews are "subjective
judgments." In discussing art,
what else is there? No music is
absolutely good or bad. Beauty is
in the eye of the beholder and
there are truths outside the Gates
of Eden and etc.

You want to know ahoiit music,
not the chairs, or the lines, or the
cops or Patti or Ken. If I were
reviewing in an era prior to the
inception of rock, maybe i could
do that. But rock is ii sociological
and cultural phenomenon as well
as a musical one. (Would you
want a reviewer of the Woodstock
weekend to talk only about
music? He'd be missing the point.)
Rock concerts are socio-cultural
events as well as musical events.
They are the affirmation of a
culture, a gathering together, a
positive celebration in a negative
world. I want to capture the
wholrI mood of a concert of which
the music is an important part,
but not the only part. interaction

cert. Long lines and delays and
even hard seats can tire an audi-
ence and dull their enthusiasm
which, in turn, can leave a group
uninspired. Concerts create a
mood, is total feeling and I think
it important to report the whole
thing. As for Patti and Ken, it’s
just a thing I like to do -- to
mention the people i go to con-
certs with. Maybe because who
I'm with effects the way I feel at a
concert. Maybe I just like to do it.
Sorry it bothers you.

As to my method of criticism,
you’re pretty much right about
what I do, but let me explain
why. Most of my reviews do come
down to various degrees and ways
of saying “good” and “bad.”
Sure, i could qualify my criticism.
I could talk about competent
drummers and inventive solos and
impeccable taste and skillful har-
monies. But what is competence?
What's inventive or impeccable or
skillful? it all comes down to this:
You have a bunch of people
making sounds and what matters
is how it feels and sounds to you.
Does it really matter how talented
Eric Clapton is if I don’t like the
sounds he makes? (Though as it
happens, I do.) There are some
talented opera singers. I just don't
like opera. When I say that a
record is good, that's a fact. It’s a
fact that I think it‘s good. And
i’m the only person i can speak

for.
My musical knowledge does not

all (or mostly) come from liner
notes or Wall Street slogans (Wall
Street slogans?) but let's not con-
fuse musical knowledgc with
musical fact. There are no musical

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1971

facts, except if you want to talk
about who recorded what when
and who wrote what and who
recorded whose material and etc.
The rest is subjective. You want
to know about music. What do
you want to know? The best
(only) way to know about music
is to listen to it.

My consumer guides are for peo-
ple who are considering the pur-
chase of an album. If we have
similar tastes and I like the music,
maybe you buy it and you like it
too. I can tell you a bit about why
I liked or disliked an album (as
space allows) but I can't deliver a
thesis or logical "proof." And
neither can anyone. I write the
way I feel, being as subjective asI
can be, because where music is
concerned I can only speak for
myself. Nobody “knows enough"
about rock to deliver the final
statement about a record, because
there is no such thing anyway. IfI
tried to speak in terms of talent or
the lack of it, I‘d either be preten-
tious or irrelevant or both. Talent
is what large numbers of people
currently like, as far as I'm con-
cerned. i don’t trust the accepted
standards. They change too fast.

As for Alvin Lee, I was trying to
point out that many musicians
end up being influenced to a great
extent by their own previous
works and styles; they can end up
imitating themselves. I didn’t in-
tend to ignore the things that
influenced them in the first place,
which in the case of Alvin Lee
(and many others) certainly in-
cludes Black music high on the
list. To say that Black music is the
source of ALL rock, however, is a
statement I can‘t agree with. Cer-
tainly, Black musicians from John
Lee Hooker to Chuck Berry have
been a major influence for huge
numbers of performers from John
Hammond to the Rolling Stones.
But ALL‘.’ ALL rock music is

inﬂuenced by only one thing --
the world. and the Black exper-
ience is an important part of that,
especially in the area of music,
but it isn’t all of It. Would you say
that Black music is the source of
Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mather?
If so, I disagree. And my “self-
-confessed ignorance of Black
music” --does that refer to my
statement that I’m not really into
Gospel music? And if so, are you
actually saying that one must
really dig Gospel music to review
rock? If so, 1 disagree again.

I'm really sorry that you and
Charles (see next letter) don't like
my reviews, but a whole lot of
people have told me that they do.
And as long as they’re around, 1'“
keep writing.

Dear Jeff,

i would like to congratulate you
on your fine evaluation of the
Chicago concert in Monday’s ASP.
It was extremely well written. No
shit. Man, you‘re really into music

Someone with all your writing
ability and talent should be wri-

shit. You really have a lot of
polish. Have you ever worked for
the Enquirer? They need someone
of your talent to deliver it.
Thanks again for your wonderful
editorial iind I'll be looking for
your own down-to-earth review of
CHICAGO 111. No shit? Bull Shit!

Sincerely yours,

Anyone who has read the recent
interviews in Rolling Stone with
John Lennon knows that the
former Beatle hiis gone through
many emotional and psychologi-
cal changes in the last year or two.

This album is one of the more
simplistic records i've heard in a
while, both musically and lyri-
cally. Gone is Lennon's subtlety
and witticism. There are no ob-

scure Lennonesque lyrics or weird
type characters.

This is a personal diary of John
Lennon. 1 know I personally don't
like to hear anyone suffer and
there is quite a lot of suffering
done here. So he didn‘t receive
any love when he was a child and
has never overcome the death of
his mother (more artfully revealed
in the earlier “Julia"). Maybe it
would interest a psychiatrist butI
don’t think Lennon's pain pro-
duces good music.

Even the ballads are surprisingly
tepid. The only song that I can
praise is the myth shattering
"God" in which Lennon re-
nounces the Beatles once and for
all (as well as most of the other
world idols).

As George Harrison says on his
more impressive album "All things
must pass." Let's hope that this
stage of Lennon’s brilliant and
always exciting career passes by
quickly.

EMERSON‘ LAKE & PALMER
(COTILLION SC 9040)

THE NICE were the most effect-
ive group at narrowing the bulg-
ing gap between rock and classical
music. Keith Emerson, the master-
l‘ul keyboards player of THE
NICE has formed a new three man
classical-rock band with two other
English lads whose groups were
split asunder: Bruce Palmer,
drummer of the ATOMIC
ROOSTER, and Greg Lake, bass-
list of KING CRIMSON.

The major deficiency of THE
NICE was the vocals, but this is
no problem for the new group
because Greg Lake retains the top
form he reached on the excellent
“Court of the Crimson King" al-
burn.

The vocals though are primarily
a vehicle for Emerson's stellar
piano and organ work.

The ends equal the sum of thy
parts on every song. Even though
the group is brand new they
sound like they have played to-
gether for years. Any other group
that tried to mix a Moog with an
acoustic guitar on a folk song
would have to be tested for suici-
dal tendencies but Emerson & Co.
somehow blend the two together
with ease
