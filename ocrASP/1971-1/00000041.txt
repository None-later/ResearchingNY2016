WOOPSTERS RIP NEW PALTZ, 87-61

by John DeBlasio

Albany State’s Snuersmcn kept
on rolling Tuesday nite with a
smashing victory over New Pziitz,
87-61. The win was the Great
Danes' eighth in their Inst ninc
outings, upping their overall
record to 11 very respectable 12-5.

Jim Masterson took game
honors with 23 points, Jordan
finished with 14, Shechun 10,
Quattrocchi 9, Reid 8. and Holln
7. It was a fine overall team
effort.

The first half stiw the Great
Danes take a 40-27 lead, but it
was it very shaky one. Numerous
turnovers plagued both tczims
from the outset of the game. This
was due to the very aggressive
defense employed by both Albany

and New Paltz. The game was nip
and tuck at the outset, with
Albiiny boasting an early 12-10
lCtld. Then Jim Mnstcrson, Jock
Jordan, and Werner Kolln started
their respective things and started
Albany moving. Miisterson repetit-
cdly kept New Pultz off guard
with his thirty foot bombs; and
when Albany's sharp shooters
were missing their marks, Jordan
was always there scooping up the
bounds. The 6' senior picked off 7
rebounds while also contributing
9 points. But it was Werner Kolln
who seemed to spiirk the uncer-
tain offense. Crashing the bourds
heavily, Wernew somehow man-
aged a five point play midway
through the first hiilf.

Hc stabbed one rebound, sunk

the shot, and was fouled. When he
subsequently missed the free
throw, Albany grabbed the bound
and shot unsuccessfully. Kolln
then shared the rebound, put it in,
and was fouled. This time, how-
ever, he sunk the charity toss.
Albany began pulling away slow~
Iy, ending the half with u 40 to 27
Iczid. Mnsterson lend all scorers in
the first half with 11. Dave
Wclchons also sparkled as he
turned in three steals.

1n the second half New Paltz
started out as if they were going
to leave the Great Dance in the
dust. Six straight points and the
Albany lend we. cut to 40-33. But
Jim Mristerson's fire refused to be
put out as he again pumped in
some thirty footers. Steve

Sheehan then took his turn hitting
the boards and cashing them in
for lay-ups. Jordan, Reid, and
Quattrocchi each hit a couple of
outside shots and the Great Danes
had increased the double margin
to 19 points with a 62-41 bulge.
Shortly afterward, Couch Sauers
cleared his entire bench, giving his
subs their longest playing time
this season. They played the game
out to an 87-61 Albuny win.

Though New Paitz is no basket-
ball powerhouse, the Great Danes
did turn in a very strong game.
The defense was up to its usual
true form, while the offen ie seems
to be improving with every game.
Lets hope Albany's good defense
and current offensive perfor-
mances will prevail Saturday night
against arch-rival Siena College, as
Doc will be trying for his 250th
lifetime win as the Albany net
coach.

Zeke Speaks

by Bob Zaremba

 

 

Go to the Siena game tomorrow night. It's not far away, and it'll
be well worth your while. Tickets are being sold at the
information desk of the Campus Center right now. Siena is selling
them too, so get one now. If you want to get a ticket at the door.

just be there early.

Albany—Siena games never fail to hiccup. to their promotion. It's
it fierce rivalry, right up there witrrW"onee‘,TArmy-Navy,
USU-UCLA, STB-APA, just to name a few.

This your Siena is minus their big 6'7 ',’.attraction, Bob Hermann,
who used to provide most of the entertuinmént with his annual

Albany State choke.

Even without the opportunity to ride Hermann, it still figures to
be ii fun evening. They call us “Albany High" and we call them
“Saint Rose" and everybody more or less has a good time.

As the worn out saying goes,“anything can happen when these
two tennis get together." And it usually does happen. So go.

#ﬁlhltiQIIC

When you‘re at the game, here's an easy, handy-dandy guide for

ref hecklers to follow.
Look tit Doc.

If u cull's been made, and you think we‘ve been done dirty but
want to be sure before you shoot your mouth off, look at Doc.
Nobody knows the rules better than he does. After the call, shoot
a quick look ill. him. If his arms are folded and his face is taut and
glued to the floor action, you can save your breath. The ref did
something right (the bum, it's about time).

If his arms are folded and his jaw is moving, then SUNYA has
been wronged, But only mildly wronged. If he's standing up hands

on hips, and his jiiw is moving,
very big way.

SUNYA has been wronged in a

If his eyes luck their bending concentration, and his facial
muscles lnck their triutncss, and his mouth is rcliixed and
broadened in it slight grin, then you've been looking tit the wrong

guy.

________———-—-———

The Tigers have been improving
on defense and rebounding with
each game each time they play.
Offcnsivcly, they litin 11 whole
crop of good scorers that can

break loose at any moment, as
evidenced by the fact that the
high scorers haven't been the same
in any of the previous four games.
