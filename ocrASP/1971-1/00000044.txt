Capitol hill of"...

Dear ASP:

My initial reaction to reading
about the proposed “shit in" on
the capitol steps was one of mild
enthusiasm. Maybe this was the
answer to our years of frustrating
ineffectiveness. Yes, this was civil
disobedience in its truest form.

However. upon closer study, it
seems that this brilliant, imagin-
ative means of protest may create
some problems. Firstly. a number
of people who have been an inte-
gral part of the peace movement,
consistently opposed to our ag-
gressive actions in Southeast Asia,
will be left out in the cold. More
specifically. suppose one of these
gallant crusaders suffered from
constipation on the designated
day of protest. He would be
robbed of his ability to participate
in our democratic system, iiiilrss
of course he had a hawkish friend
who was willing to do him a
rather gross favor.

At the other extreme, consider
the case of the protesters who on
that day suffer from diahrrea. Are
they the ones who will have the
loudest voices? Will these lucky
ones become the new leaders of
the (if you‘ll pardon the expres-
sion) movement?

Although I consider this pro-
posed action impractical at the
present time, it nevertheless de-
monstrates the remarkable intel-
ligence of some of the members of
the New Left. Some day the
degree of participation in our des
mocratic system will be based on
the magnitude of our excrement.
It makes me proud to be an
American.

“Eagle” is
Right!
To the Editor:

That the ASP often has reported
stories without the slightest at-
tempt ut obtaining the facts has
long been known. it is only when
one is at the receiving and of this
misreporting, however. that one is
compelled to respond.

Mr. Warner's article (editorial?
Most times you can't tell) con-
cerning the ALBANY EAGLE
proved to be little more than a
compilation of untruths coupled
with the usual smears.

1) Mr. Warner refers to "a hand-
ful of secretive YAFers". If he
doesn't know who we are. then
how does he presume we -are

 

 

YAFers? (In truth, the Eagle is
not a YAF publication and the
overwhelming majority of staff
members do not even belong to
YAF).

2) Mr. Warner takes the word
"conservative" and immediately
conjures up images such as “op-
pression of students and suppres-
sion of civil liberties.”

Come, now. Mr. Warner. have
you ever seen in the EAGLE
anywhere a suggestion such as
that? Have we ever even come
close whinting such a thing? You
know the answer, of course, but
after all. moderate con- servatism
doesn‘t make for sensational arti-
cles, does it'.’

3) Mr, Warner refers to a specific
article which I wrote concerning
the courage of one of my teachers
last May who held classes despite
enormous attempts by the Left to
suppress him.

What is interesting is that Mr,
Warner has come up with the
“fact” that this particular profes-
sor refused to let his students
choose one of the famous “five
options”.

communi-

cations

In any other circles i would
consider this a blatant lie, but l
must presume that Mr, Warner
was merely “misinformed”. i be-
lieve an apology to said professor
by Mr. Warner would be in order.

4) “The Eagle is an up«to-diite
northern extension of the Birch
Society". How many idiocies can
Mr, Warner squeeze into one arti-
cle? It is nothing short of ama-
zing! And he goes on!!

6) "Much in the same manner as
the Freshman Senator from this
state... passes bigotry. selfishness.
and violence off as something
American" Great, isn‘t it? In one
secondary clause he manages to
link Jim Buckley. the Albany
EAGLE. and the worst elements
of American Society.

Suffice it to say that the
EAGLE will continue to publish
with or without Mr. Warner‘s sup-
port. We believe that we present a
perspective on the news and cur-
rent issuea that is too often ne-
glected.

We never expect the ASP or
even the majority of students to
accept our opinions. We do hope,
however. that in an atmosphere of

Unbiased “Eagle”

Dear Sir:

Bob Warner stated in his criti-
cism of The Albany Eagle that
The Eagle “deserves mention be-
cause it represents a significant
minority on campus as well as
across the country." I couldn‘t
agree with Mr. Warner more.

The Albany Eagle provides stu-
dents with an alternative, a depar-
ture from the decidedly one-sided
publications distributed on cam<
pus. I personally find The Eagle
interesting because. unlike the
left-oriented publications. the ed-
itors of The Eagle do not assume
“saviors of Americri” attitudes, as
Mr. Warner has suggested. instead
they present a refreshingly posi-
tive attitude that suggests solu»
tions to existing problems rather
than creating others. The Eagle
does not blindly claim that all is
right with America btit then again
it doesn't claim that all is wrong.

The Eagle apparently aspires
for. rather than “promises”. a
“day when sanity and rational
behavior will reign on college cam»
puses across America”, to com-
pensate for the current shortage
of these qualities. ConservatiVes
do advocate a much needed sane
and rational maintainence of "law
and order” to insure rind protect
the individual's "civil liberties".
This philosophy is in marked con-
trast to the irrational and often
apparently insane behavior of left
oriented philosophy.

Finally, Mr. Warner's claim that
The Eagle is published by “a
handful of secretive YAF‘ers" is
ludicrous. Young
Americans for Freedom does not,
to this date and my knowledge.
sponsor a publication on campus.
This is a perfect example of tot-
ally biasod reporting. sensation-
alism and a complete disassocia-
tion with the facts.

Bincerly.

Editorial Comment '

Racism

Article

The Albany Student Press apologizes for any confusion
over the nature of last Friday’s article “Where is Racism
Going?" by Michael Lippmaii. The article . we thought.
was clearly labeled as opinion. This was not clear to all.
and in the future all articles of opinion will be so labeled.
We also restate our policy of accepting any replies to such
opinions and will include this statement after such articles

of opinion.

Above and beyond Iliis. we believe the Lippnian articles
was well-intended, but did not take certain factors into
consideration. Black reaction was not considered. but we
hope that this will not stop communication. Racism is
ignorance. and the communication of iiiforiiialion is the
best weapon against ignorance. The Albany Student Press
is not sorry that it opened the issue. Rather. we regret that
it opened on such a note. Hopefully. the replies and
rebuttal to the initial will improve relations betwccn the

I'dL'CS.

On one matter, that of furthering rumors about the
l£.().l’. program. we see an excellent solution. The ASP will
soon publish a report on the prograinwhichwill dispel such
rumors. Again. we hope to carry this on with other aspects
of tlic geiicral problem of racism. We have reached a point
where we can either retreat and pretend that racism does
not exist. that it isn't a problem; or we can move ahead
and try to communicate,cductilc. and resolve the problem

which so deeply concerns us.

The decision is made: there will be no retreat.

Weekend Crackdown

This past weekend saw a big security crackdown on
unauthorized parking. While this probably has the support
of many students and faculty. it is a wrong in more than
one way. First. it came on a weekend when there are NO
l’A(‘UL'l‘Y and N0 ADMINISTRATORS here at all. Only
students are sacrificed. Second. the “no parking" rttlc has
always been “unofficially suspended" during weekends.
\VllL‘li iriiflicc is lighter than normal, Failure to enforce the
law is as serious an offense as the breaking of that same
law, And last. iuliiiiatcly tied in the first two. there was
ultrii/iilr'h' no prior iiwrniiig given.

The lililtlfC to communicate on the part of Security is
astounding. For the above three reasons. this newspaper
urges the Security Office to declare it general amnesty for
llll tickets issued this weekend. in the meantime. all
rccipiciits should not pay lltc fines, and should instead
appeal the tickets immediately listing the above three
reasons. This must be done within three days and the form
can be filled out at the Student Association office. to
which llicy must be returned (Campus Center 346) along
with the summons (a fancy euphemism for ticket).

Black Ensemble Triumphs

With “Song

by Beth Jo Knapke

The Black Ensemble gave an
excellent performance of John
Pepper Clark's “Song of a Goat"
on Friday Feb. 12. This produc~
tion was the combination of all
the efforts of the cast and crew
who educated us about African
folklore. Under the direction of
Milledge Mosley Jr. the five separ-
ate movements intci'lwine African
folklore with the problem of ste-
rilily in an African couple. it was
difficult to understand the prob-
lem at first because of a few very
long speeches, but as soon as the
audience knew the couple‘s prob-
lem. the play moved very smooth

“Song of a Goat” begins with
the birth of man and woman in
Africa. The occurrence was the
first scene on stage, and it is one
of the best examples of panto-
mine I‘ve seen yet. for Donnell E.

ofa

Undcrwoood (the man) explored
his environment so gracefully and
so naively along with Lynn Gil-
more. his wife. This scene is a
precedent that symbolically ex-
pressed man's importance in the
female‘s life and how she was and
will always be dependent on him
for lter happiness One example
the play explores is Zifa (Milledgc
Mosley) who is unable to give his
wife Ebiere (Lavern Copeland) a
child. They are unhappy because
they cannot give their daughter a
sister or brother.

The family which is closely knit
consists of a brother and an aunt.
Orukorerc, played by Omoye
Cooper, is the mother guardian of
the two boys. and she is tormen-
ted by visions of a leopard killing
a goat. Little does she know this is
the curse of evil and tragedy that
will afflict the family; however.
no one can prevent the curse. As
in Greek tragedy the curse is often
manifest in an unhappy cxper~

 

Wrong Number Rings a Bell

Robin Saigon, portraying Mrs.

credibility ofan unlikely situation
and then swiftly heaped anticipa-

make the 30 minute play seem

major role in the play, yet Jon

very good.

case Ebiere seduces Tonya, the
brother. and both suffer because
the evil force had combined with
human desire. Ebiere was the ser-
pent or hiid the evils of that

creature to spur her into sexual
relations with her husband's bro-
ther.

Zifa. upon discovery of the
crime, reacts so well that this
sample of grief and anger was the
most climactic and enjoyable tal-
ent of the evening. Zifa was angry,
was Vengeful, and at last cried
upon his mother's shoulder. This
was the most emotional and beuu-
til‘ul part in the play—that the
mart was masculine enough to
admit he was human, too. He is
allowed to cry and he should cry
without appearing emasculated.

The cast had four outstanding
members. Milledge Mosley as
mentioned before; Tonya (Mario
Arthur) whose dialogue and move-
ments were most professional and
majestic; Ebiere (Laverne Cope-
land) was beautifully feminine
and malicious in her own right;
and Orukorere (Omoye Cooper)
whose movements and timing
wcrc Very natural. The Black En-
scmblc was successful again. and
their addition of a general open
discussion clarified some of the
symbols and the meaning of the
play. I hope the group plans simi-
lar productions.

ROCK PILE

by Eric Graeber
LIVE ALBUM/GRAND FUNK (CAPITOL SWBB-61l3)
NANTUCKET SLEIGHRIDE/MOUNTAIN (WINDFALL 5500)

After the demise of CREAM,
many groups struggled to fill the
void of the grou that popularized
the wah-wah petal, long solos, live
albums. etc. Two of the most

0 ultir are MOUNTAIN and
Eli'AND FUNK RAILROAD,
both basically guitar, bass. and
drum groups. Of the pair. MOUN—
TAIN comes close to matching
the coordination and sharpnem
that CREAM usually roduced,
while FUNK leaves a bitter taste
in my mouth.

In their new album. “Nantucket
Sleighride" MOUNTAIN reaches
the scope and full potential that
we heard glimpses of in their
l‘Climbing" album.

The lyrics are given secondary
importance. As a muttcr of fact,
in some cases. the words seem to
be thrown in as an afterthought.
Other songs such as "Tired An-
iels" or “The Great Train Rob-

cry,“ have very interesting lyrics
but they are lost in the transla»
tion. But this point should not be
ovcrcmphasizod because N
TAIN is basically an instrumental
group.

The melody for each song is
very tiiht as eslie West creates a
beauti ully patterned outline'wtth
his lead and rhytliim guitars,
West's guitar notes are bouncy
with only an occassional shrie .
And every note is clearly pro-
nounced. something that cannot
be said for Mark Earner, lead

guitar of GRAND FUNK, who
proudccs a caco hony of sounds

which only rarey are distinguish-

able . West limits his solos to two
or three minutes while Farncr
sometimes takes that long on his
closing notes.

FUNK is definitein the most
rctentious group have ever
card. I get the impression they
think they are real revolutionaries,
liberating their audience. a la the

5.

Everyone imitates Ginger Baker
nowadays an Don Brewer is one
of the worst at it. His drumming
in ’I‘.N.U.C. does not include one
original beat. The bass laying of
Mel Schacher is much ctter live
than in the studio. However West
and Papalardi get much better
interplay on their instruments
than do Earner and Schachi-r, who
fly off on separate tangents.

So where does that leave us'.’
With Fariier. who has many dc-
votcd fans who insist that he is it
major talent. While I will not deity
that he has written some good
material. I argue that he is higth
overrated. His hard. drivin i, roug
voice drives me right up t c wall.
and his guitar work s ows oiin
brief flashes of promise.

I admit that GRAND FUNK is a
groove when stoned. But if you

break all the parts down. you
realize that their talent is limited.

Verve has released a double al—
bum by Jimmy Smith taken from
past recordings called 2-] Karul
Hits (Vii-6522). There are a few
good things jazz wise. “Bluesette”
and “GreenslceVes” are attrac-
tively arranged and there are a few
good organ solos such as on”Joy
House" and “John Brown's
Body.” Smith has ll nice vocal
take on “Is You Is or is You Ain't
My Baby.” There are a few guitar
solos spread about, probably by
Kenny Burrell, the rest is routine
Jimmy Smith r&h, like I‘Mojo"
and “iioochie Coochc Milli.” All
in all a rather ordinary set,

A five record set. being sold at
an incredibly reduced price. fea-
turing Ella Fitzgerald is quite a
disappointment,..’l‘hc George and
Ira (.‘crsliiuin Song [look (Verve
V-29-5). Nelson Riddle‘s listless
arrangemean of Gershwin's melo-
dies, which for some reason omits
“Summertime” and “My Man's
(lone Now," range all the way
from slow to medium slow...wow!
As a result all songs are nearly
indistinguishable from one
another. In addition, Ella, who
works much better with a small
unit. is helplessly tied down. So.
what could have been a fantastic
session by one of the great singers
of our day turns out to be ii hum
drum affair

The three record set The Ant/tr»
logy of Indian Music Vol. ()nc
l'caluring ltavi Shiinkur. is both
handsomely packaged. and we
produced. Unless one is a scholar
in Indian Music it is best not to
attempt analysis. Let's just say
that i find Shankiir's playing ima-
ginative and his technique amaz-
ing. The sympathy he has with his
“drummers” Rakha, and Ghosh is
magical. It is interesting to hear
how similar this nearly completely
improvised music is to jazz, andi
believe a jazz fan has a better

chance of enjoying the music than
does one of any other musical
taste. Included With the records is
a booklet which helps explain the
music and one of the records
combines verbal description with
musical example.

There are some Mothers albums
going out at sale prices. and that is
a treat for sore ears. Molherriiania
is a collection of the best of
Mothers albums. Frank Zappa's
genious is very evident here.
“Brown Shoes Don't Make It" has
a cool ostinato guitar segment.
and is typically gross with lots of
falsetto voices and a short echo
chamber trumpet interlude.
“Mother People" talks about the
other people. which is everybody.
it is beautifully satyrical and con-
cerns middle America's hatred of
long hairs. “idiot Bastard Son” is
a classic in its mournful way, with
puffs ofsound mixed with crooks,
and a most interesting melodic
line. Absolutely Free is more of
the same. “Status Back Baby" is
both musical and verbal humor
about high school days featuring
honky tonk sax. “America
Drinks” has several transitional
pieces rolled into a few minutes,
all intentionally corny. Reuben
and the Jets is a deliberate finger
in the direction of the l950's
muzak, and culture~short hair,
screwing in the back seat after the
football game etc. it’s funny for
awhile, but wears thin before the
album is finished. Frank Zappa is

a genious in disguise. His icono-
clastic humor is music‘s answer to
Lenny Bruce and unfortunately it
has often kept many from realiz-
ing his artistry in the area of
composition. in my opinion he is
the greatest composer of Ameri-
can music of the 1960's. He is
willing to use almost any sound to
produce the desired affect, includ-
ing electronics, grunts and other
weird sounds. and the music al-
most always fits the inane lyrics.
