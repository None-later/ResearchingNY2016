250a. Win an Dag

CAGERS ROUT SIENA

by Robert Mirett

Albany State’s Great Danes
roiled OVer arch rival Siena College
Saturday night, by a score of
85-70 as Coach Richard "Doc"
Sauent recorded his 250th lifetime
win. Siena became the ninth team
to fall to the Sauersmcn in their
last ten games. Although the game
was built up to be one of those
“down to the wire" jobs, it was
nothing of the sort. With a little
over three and one-half minutes to
go in the game the State cageis
held a commanding lead of 8062
which dwindled to the final mar-
gin of 15 points as Conch Sam-rs
gave his starters a well-desewed
rest. Albany's substitutes Illt'll
played out the remainder of the
game as Sienii's starters vainly
tried to salvage something of a
respectable defeat. Al the outset.
of the game. the Danes poor
rebounding off the offensive
boards and their inability to con-
tain Sicna's driving guards left
them trailing midway through the
first half. The margin was Just five
points only as a result of the fine
outside shunting of Albany's rlill'h
Jordan and John Qiiiilirot'clii.

As the game wore on, Albany's
defense tightened up and forced
Sienu into taking poor percentage
shots. Steve Slim-him emerged as a
significant factor as he ci'usltcil Ilit'
boards at both ends of tllt‘t'lllil’l.
The half ended with Stale leading.

WRESTLEBS COP SIXTH STRAIGHT "

by Dave Fink

in past. years. the Albany State
wrestling team has not exactly
burned up the mats. This year has
beenn different story though.
Coach Joe Garcia has had to order
new ones after each of the last six
matches, the latest instance being
this past Saturday as the Grap-
piers registered their sixth con-
secutive win by a ill-3 socre vs
Plattsburg.

The Danes won three matches
by forfeit and lost only one to the
Northerners. In the IIH lb. class.
Larry Fredericks won by a pin as
did Captain Jeff Albrechi and
teammate Kevin Roach. In the

142 lb. and 160 lb. classes. respect-

ively. Both Co-Cupt. Phil Mims
(158) and Cliff Wess il67) out-
pointed their opponents in close
contests. Al Mercer pinned his
adversary in the 177 lb. class as
Tom Hull. Jim Nightingale and
Tim Coons picked up the forfeits.

Last Wednesday, the Danes bent
(1W. Post by a very tight 23-i6
margin. Coulis was the team star
as he movr-rl up to ilie heavy
weight class (he usually wrestles at
tilt) lbs.) and pinned his Bilfr lb

opponent which provided enough
points to win the match.

Tom Hull remained undefeated
with his forfeit win Saturday. Hull
is only a freshman. hailing from
Albany Academy High School.
Other wrestlers leading the charge
are also underclassmen. Tri-
captain Phil Mims is only a sopho-
more from Utica Free Academy.

Jeff Albreit. last season's fresh-
mun star. is now a sophomore, but
suffering from no jinx whatsoever.
Roach and Merier are also sophs,
from Rochester and Baldwinsville.
respectively. Cliff Wess is a fresh-
man from Bellmore. L.l.

The team is young. and it's
good. The string of six wins ties a
ten year old record. What's more.
it assures the State Grapplers a
winning season, something they
haven‘t had since the 1966-67
SCIISOT’I.

The team's final home match is
on Wednesday. against New Paltz.
A seventh consecutive victory
would be unprecedented in Al-
bany mut history. It will also be
your last chance to see them. It
starts at 2 p.in. Get out there
