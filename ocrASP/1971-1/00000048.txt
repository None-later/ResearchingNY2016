“...try using something else other than your ill-informed mind."

Dear Mr. White Side and those de-
prived ones of his “cliche”:

While reading your opinionated
article of a situation of which you
know little about, my first re-
action upon concluding was to
laugh. I really think you haVe a
great sense of poor humor. Then I
realized that you really believa
what you have so earnestly writ-
ten down in your article and as a
result I have decided that you are
one of “those” that needs some
help. I am writing this reply to
your article so that you can take
in consideration the other side's
story, for you may decide to write
about this subject once again.

First of all I would like to say
that I must agree with your state-
ment concerning "cliches." I
think that most of the white
people that I have spoken with on
occasion do think in "cliches",
with no individualism at all. Al-
though I cannot judge on how
qualified you are to make state
ments about whites. I can only
guess that being White you have
had enough experience with them
to know. However, I would re-
commend that you conﬁne your
statements to dealing with whites,
for your statement concerning the
characteristic of being black is
being “snotty” is a racist state-
ment, for thére are more snotty
whites present on this snotty cam-
pus anyway.

Dealing with the Black and
E.O.P. Blacks who are on E.O.P.
do not have the tendency to dress
much better than the average
white student (including you)
mainly because they are on
E.O.P., but rather because Blacks
have a standard value concerning
dressing well and staying clean
unlike “some whites" that l have

come across. I cannot explain for
your choice of sloppy attire sub-
ordinate to that of Blacks, but I
can say maybe you should try
harder.

When the check comes! It’s real-
ly funny how you have stated that
when the checks come E.O.P.
students run off and buy stereos.
This statement I thought was es-
pecially funny coming from a
white person, because it brings to
mind a reality about certain poor
blacks living in the Ghetto and a
day called “Check Day". This is
the day when those recipients on
Welfare get their periodical rations
of money, to keep them just
barely alive. This also is the day
when “your father" comes out

also. He comes out with both of
his hands extended reaching into
the pockets of those swindled
women for the TV or bed money,
that he sold them and they have
been paying for it for the last
twenty years. They have been
paying so long because his prices
just happened to be a little higher
than usual in their part of town. I
wonder what he boys with the
money “when the check comes”.

In conclusion I say: before you
write another article talking about
Blacks try using something else
other than your ill-informed
mind.

“ASP...our 'Liberal Racist of the Year’..."

Though it is only February, 808 feels conﬁdent in awarding the
ASP our “Liberal Racist of the Year” commendation for its fine
analysis presented From the White Side. This article belongs with
such great works as Prof. Jensen“proot‘" that black people are
genetically inferior (so for the good of mankind must be kept
from breeding their defects any further) and History 131 B,
taught here at SUNYA, which uses the works of the great and
all-knowing Voltaire, whose wisdom teaches that Blacks are a
subhuman species, obviously inferior to white men.

It is easy to see why Governor Rockefeller believes in spending
so much money for higher education. After all, any system which
teaches the ideology to which he owes his personal fortune
(racism, sexism, anti-working class ideology and most important
that ALL-AMERICAN liberalism which grants a person the ‘right'
to be racist) surely is worth spreading at any cost.

The article ’s arguments bear striking resemblance to those used
to attack welfare: People (Blacks) on welfare are dumb baby

machines, people (Puerto Ricans, Orientals)

on Welfare take

advantage of hard working tax payers (Whites), welfare is
Un-American. The ending follows with the rest of the article and
can be paraphrased “America, we’ve done it now, we gave the
Blacks a few crumbs (more than we fed the pigeons, right Henry?)
and look what has happened, they threw it back in our faces.

Such ingratitude."

"...peop|c generally on this campus are snotty..."

by Al Thompson
ASP Features Staff

Let’s face it, Albany State is just
messed up, racially, socially, and
politically. The campus scene is
off campus. Even if there weren’t
any Blacks on campus, Albany
State would be clickish, dull and
with less color to say the least.

It is openly admitted that insti-
tutionalized racism exists here but
nothing is being done to correct
the situation. No, wearing buttons
like “Love is the only way" is just
too superﬁcial. Almost as bad as
wearing one saying “Kill the
Pigs," I agree there isn't any mass
type of White and Black relations,
these have to be made individual-
ly, but there isn't any type of
White to White relationship either,
when it comes to social and poli-
tical action. This I personally wit-
nessed at an anti-Laos rally.

In reference to the article
printed Friday, “Where is Racism
Going,” a common attitude was
revealed: “I‘m not anti-Black, but
I don‘t like snotty people, and a
lot of Blacks are snotty." Wow,
haven‘t people gotten hip to the
fact that people generally on this
campus are snotty, and tight?

The second most common atti-
tude expressed in the article, held
greatly by white students is about
the EOI’ program. “The EOI’ Pro-
gram is great intellectually. When
it. gets down to an emotional level
it hurts. They havu more money
to spend than I do. They even
dress better than I do. And when
lhe Chi-ck comes they run off to
buy a stereo." --(ireat [,IOIIUI’HIIZII'

to be better dressers than whites

imagine tliosu white students
here whose old man owns slum

 

tenements in the ghettos and
charges the occupants above nor.
mal rent for living in a condemned
building with no real services,
except roaches and rats. Imagine
those white students here whose
old man exploits Blacks and other
lower-class people daily in their
businesses to send little Johnny
and Sue to Albany State. The half
hasn't been told, these are only
samples of how little Johnny and
Sue get to college on the ex-
ploited toil of others. Maybe it is
only due to Blacks and other
oppressed people the privilege
of enioying the fruits of the
majority ‘s labor for once.

No, I‘m not justifying or moral-
izing, if Blacks had the financial
backing and educational oppor-
tunities as most of their white
counterparts have had, there
wouldn't be any need of the EOI’
Program. What society has sown
in the past it is reaping now.

True, it has been a superficial
utopia on campus this fall and
winter with no great upheaval,
but we are reminded by this Bibli‘
cal quote which I took out of
context: “they should say peace,
then cometh utter chaos."

“Whitey can’t stand to be ignored."

I am a racist! Does this worry
you? If it does, you have the
wrong concept of what a racist is.
An astrologist studies the stars; a
geologist studies the earth, and a
racist studies his race of people. 1
am a Black racist and I don’t have
the time to worry about Black-
White relationships on this cam-
pus.

Many whites suffer from a su-
periority complex. When Blacks
do not cringe; when whites are
present, the whites can not handle
it. This is quite evident in an
article I read by Micheal Lippman
(Feb. 12 ASP). He states “The
E0? program is great—intellectu-
ally. When it gets to an emotional
level, it hurts. They have more
money to spend than Ido. They
even dress better than I do. And
when the check comes they runn
off to buy a stereo."

I feel that I must clear these
statements up. EOP spelled back-
wards is POE. Due to the fact that
the students don't have a great
deal of money, they tend to spend
it on necessities. They don‘t buy a
pair of $15 jeans to tear and then,
put patches or pour Clorox on
them, As far as clothes are
concerned Black people have al-
ways dressedl! There is no place

in the world where a person can
Jbuy a $20 stereo!

Many whites try to justify their
actions. They base their actions
on the actions of the Blacks.
Michael Lipprmn states, “I’m not
anti-Black, but I don’t like snotty
people, and a lot of Blacks are
snotty." Here, instead of saying,
“I don't like Blacks," he takes the
coward‘s way out. Only an infer.
ior person can be a coward, and
Blacks are not cowards!

Whites naturally think that
Blacks are belligerent. The truth
is: Blacks only respond when
something is said or done that
they feel is derogatory. You can
abuse people for so long and
eventually they will turn on you.
Blacks have turned away from the
whites. Whitey can't stand to be
ignored. They want. attention no
matter what the cost. The cost is
great!

There are many Blacks who feel
the only way they can relieve
themselves from oppression
whould be to “kill all the Whit-
eys." I feel this is not necessary.
The white man is slowly killing
himself. Every time he opens his
mouth, he has to swallow the
poison of his words. Maybe he
will shut up only to survive!
