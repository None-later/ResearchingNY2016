EAR TO THE THUNDER

 

 

by Arlene Scheurer

Want to hear an oft ill uscd
word? New. But that's what des-
cribes Tony Williams Lifetime's
new album Turn 1'! Over (Polydor
24-4021). The power is beyond
imagination, the combination of
the beauties of rock and jazz
complete, the talent supreme.

Tony Williams has long estab-
lished his greatness with the Miles
Davis quintet. Being a member of
one of the most important of jazz
groups at the age of 19 is nothing
to scoff at. His incredible tech-
nique, his soulful, pouring, driving
force, his ﬂashy, striking, encr-
getic colors are all well focused on
here.

Jack Bruce's reputation with
Cream won‘t. be lost here. He
creates a nice foundation. John
McLaughlin introduces new ideas
on guitar. He will be a new force
on his instrument. Khalid Yasin
(Larry Young) on organ, has some
nice solo moments, but his accom-
paniment (if such a tame phrase is
appropriate) is beautiful.

The only reservation I have
concerns the vocals that are simi»
liir to Schoenberg‘s speech-singing
technique. It becomes boring after
the initial affect wears off.

There is a lot of electronic
affects, but they are well used;
they shock, move and create all
kinds of moods. Chch out “Oncc
I Loved" and “Night.” “To Whom
It May Concern" is superb in
terms of pure excitement. The
arrangements are excellent using
many of the various sounds slit'il ti
group can produce, conslnnlly
changing tempos, always fresh,
and, yes, now, So il~ you liltc rut-k

ment that it record is nice to have
playing in a supermarket, or dur-
ing a light conversation with a
friend cannot be used. It is this
type of music that is anti-art. It
cannot surprise, or excite or exhi—
larale or stimulate. Here are two
albums that are that kind of pro-
duct.

All the requirements for easily
ignored music are in these albums.
Early in the Morning (Polydor
24-11506), and James Lust's Sufi
Rock (Polydor 211-4507) - the
popular songs with all the emrr
tions drained out, an unimagin-
ativc drummer who reads cliches
from his chart, syrupy strings,
and, in Early in the Morning. a
choral group that sings in tircd,
drap harmonics.

There is little use in describing
each song us they have been for‘
mulated to the point of losing all
individuality. Hunter Kullman‘s
girls on Early occussionally use a
German accent which lcnds an
unintentional air of humor, but
his arranging is absurdly unirr
spircd.

Inspiration is perhaps what
mnkcs Lust‘s album the better. He
seems to really believe what hc's
doing. "Yr-sli-rday" actually cori-
vr-ys a mood-super sentimentality-
witli the weeping violin. “Lay
Lady Lily" is ll bt-ttL-r song than
anything Kullmnn hits to offer,
Although host's treatment of it
would be likr>ly to bring up Dy‘
Inn's ltrlt-sl (llllllt'l’ tl' llt' heard it,
the song‘s licrrrl still pulsntr-s,
rrlbcit faintly.

'l'ht- (lil(‘lt)l'h’ and rt'slnurimls

"Bee Gees’ At The Palace:
Quality, Not Quantity

by Jeff Burger

There are a few things that I want to my about this concert and they are
as follows, neatly grouped and categorized for filing or whatever:

I. Crowds, lines, vibes, moods,
names.etc. Dept.

(Pete Jackobs and Charles
Kriete, if by chance or cosmic
accident you're still reading my
reviews, you might want to skip
this section.) Anyway, It should
be said that the concert began
late, and in conjunction with this
minor bringdown there was a fair-
ly major bringdown at the door in
the form of moss pushing and
shoving to get in; I saw a few
people get almost crushed and
that sort of thing. Later, these
same people who were in posses-
sion of such together manners at
the door, kept it up inside. They
yelled and shouted requests all
through the Bee Gees set: they
were very noticeable during the
ballads (unfortunately). On the
other hand, they were enthusiastic
(there were at least three standing
ovations) and excitement is what
a rock concert is all about, but
then excitement has nothing to do
with being rude. It should be
noted that I‘m not talking about
the whole audience; also that the
reason for the late start was not
the fault of the promoter, the
groups just weren‘t ready in time.

2. Supershow

A preview of the film
Supershmu was given. (The film
will be shown in full on Friday,
Saturday and Sunday and a com-
plete review will appear after

wards. For now, just a mention
that it. looks fantastic. Good co-
lor, excellent photography, good
sound (loud), good music.

3. Staple Singers

Good ol’ Pop Roebuck Staples
and his three daughters. Pop must
be well into his forties-at least—-
and there he was plugged into an
electric guitar and telling us to get
it on. And he didn't look ridicu-
lous us you might expect (instead,
some of us looked ridiculous, be-
cause he was able to “get it on"
better than alot of us. ) He was
really young and alive. The daugh-
ter who sang land had a deep and
flexible voice which covered a lot
of range and carried well; the
harmonies delivered by her two
sisters were smooth and pleasant.
Early in their set, I was
disappointed in the group's back-
up, a three mun group which
seemed rather lifeless and added
nothing to the presentation. How-
ever, i had to change my mind
later on when they warmed up
and showed what they could do.
Among the group’s numbers were
“For What It's Worth",“Give A
Damn", and " The Weight", all
well presented in forceful gospel-
blues.

4. Bee Gees

First of all, it turned out to be a
fifteen piece orchestra instead of a
thirty piece as advertised and no

To chf Burger:

As insulting to you as Jacob's
letter was, there was an awful lot
of hard truth contained within,
while your reply was both supcr-
ficitil and innaccurate.

Iicvicws are opinions, as you
say, htrt they should be substan-
tinted opinions, giving insight-
bcyond the more surface-“about
the object being reviewed. As an

English major you are surely
aware of Eliot's criticism of
Hamch He didn't mercly say it

failed, but carefully explained
why it failed, thus, agree with him
or not, you became conscious of
new clcmcnts in the play. Any
dccvnt nithicjournal, whether it be
Down Iii-til or Rollin/.1 Slum: does
its own variation on the some
idea.

Your enjoyment of music, sub-
jt‘cliVl' as il is, still (It-ponds on
rrithcr slrrblc values. If you cx-
plun- your own Instr-s ht-l'trrc you
wrilc you would understand this.
()thm'wist- anyone who would be
t-iwrgvtic enough to say i like this
album wrruld br- qualified as a
(‘t'illt‘.

Your consumer guide argument

is clever, but misses the real point.
Someone who disagrees with your
opinion on one album will not
necessarily disagree on another.
Whirl is important is your under-
lying vrrlues that lead you to your
conclusions themselves. For ex-
ample, if you like Chiago because
it has jazz elements well inte-
grated into a rock context and
your reader likes to hear music of
that type, then he will find your
column worth while.

As fur us your writing about
crowds, police, etc. being relevant
because rock is a “sociological rind
cultural phenomenon"...well so is
all art music. So any music will
tell you more that the temporary
environment of the concert. And
if you do find it necessary to
wrilc about these surroundings
then you have tlic responsibility
of cxpluining why the information
is relevant.

So if you can't write anything
more than this is good and that is
frtir than why not leave it ill. that
rather than throwing all that extra
reading material just to fill up
spaict'.

Bob lloscrtblurn

one knows why. Fifteen in all
there Were, that's all. No matter.
The Bee Gees were really beau-
tiful to pay an orchestra, they
won't perform unless they can do
it right. The three brothers who
dominate the proceedings were all
in fine form.. , .

The concert was conceptually
similar to the Moody Blues con-
cert at' State last spring. They
stayeé away from improvisation
or extended numbers. They stuck
to familiar material, seeking to
reproduce the sound they obtain
on albums, only live. And, like the
Moodies, they succeeded well: the
sound was staggering. To take a
song like “Lonely Day, Lonely
Nights", their new single and re-
produce the polished record ver-
sion on stage complete with or-
chestration— well, it’s no small
achievement. Yer. without the stu-
dio benefits of echo chambers,
overdubbing, retakes, etc., they
still succeeded completely. Their
voices were as full and as beauti-
ful its on record: you‘re left: think-
ing, my God, they really can sing
like that, that really is the way
they sound!

For some reason, the
Bee Gees were not. satisfied with
'the sound and they left after a set
that was somewhere around an
hour in length (a bit less or more;
I didn't time it and don’t want to
quote a number...in any case, it
was too short, at least for anyone
sitting in a $5.50 seat.) Though
the last few songs all got standing
ovations, the group was gone in a
flick of the eye and heading down
the thruway to New York.

5. Hype & Editorial Dept.

The Bee Gees are a top act. One
of the reasons that they left. early
was the small audience. The thea-
tre was less than half full. There
are something like 80 times more
people in New York than there
are in Albany; maybe we just
don't have the numbers to sup-
port a weekly concert setup. 0n
the other hand, maybe we do. All
'the other Bee Gees concerts on
their tour are sell—outs. This one
should have been: it was the first
concert of their first American
tour in years.

If you do like to go to concerts,
and you're lucky enough to have
some money, the Palace is plan-
ning Byrds, Elton John, Hot
Tuna, etc. If nobody goes, that'll
be it. If the place stays 50% full,
and the promoter keeps losing
money, it will close. Period. (Mor-
ril: If you want to go, go. If you
don't, don‘t.)
