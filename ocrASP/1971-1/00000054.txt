“...try using something else other than your ill-informed mind."

Dear Mr. White Side and those de—
prived ones of his "cliche":

While reading your opinionated
article of a situation of which you
know little about, my first re-
action upon concluding was to
laugh. I really think you have a
great sense of poor humor. Then I
realized that you really believe
what you have so earnestly writ-
ten down in your article and as a
result I have decided that you are
one of "those" that needs some
help. I am writing this reply to
your article so that you can take
in consideration the other side’s
story, for you may decide to write
about this subject once again.

First of all I would like to say
that I must agree with your state-
ment concerning "cliches." I
think that most of the white
people that I have spoken with on
occasion do think in “cliches”,
with no individualism at all. Al-
though I cannot judge on how
qualified you are to make state-
ments about whites. I can only
guess that being white you have
had enough experience with them
to know. However, I would re-
commend that you conﬁne your
statements to dealing with whites,
for your statement concerning the
characteristic of being black is
being “snotty” is a racist state-
ment, for there are more snotty
whites present on this snotty cam-
pus anyway.

Dealing with the Black and
E.0.P. Blacks who are on E.O.P.
do not have the tendency to dress
much better than the average
white student (including you)
mainly because they are on
E.O.P., but rather because Blacks
have a standard value concerning
dressing well and staying clean
unlike "some whites" that I have

come across. Icannot explain for
your choice of sloppy attire sub-
ordinate to that of Blacks, but I
can say maybe you should try
harder.

When the check comes! It’s real-
ly funny how you haVe stated that
when the checks come E.0.I’.
students run off and buy stereos.
This statement I thought was es-
pecially funny coming from a
white person, because it brings to
mind a reality about certain poor
blacks living in the Ghetto and a
day called “Check Day". This is
the day when those recipients on
Welfare get their periodical rations
of money, to keep them just
barely alive. This also is the day
when "your father" comes out

also. He comes out with both of
his hands extended reaching into
the pockets of those swindled
women for the TV or bed money,
that he sold them and they have
been paying for it for the last
twenty years. They have been
paying so long because his prices
just happened to he a little higher
than usual in their part of town.I
wonder what he buys with the
money “when the check comes".

In conclusion I say: before you
write another article talking about
Blacks try using something else
other than your ill-informed
mind.

(Editor's note: the articles on these two pages were
received as replies to Michael Lippman's "Where is
Racism Going? which appeared in last Friday’s

ASP. We print them not because we are ashamed of
the Lippman article (if it has done nothing else, it
has started communication). but becasue the ASP
feels that all sides have a right to be heard. There are
two replies which are not included here because
they were not signed. As always, the ASP will
withhold names, but we must, by law, have a
signature to all articles submitted. The authors or
the two articles are requested to identify themselves.

considered for publication, with or without names.
In accordance with our editorial policy, Michael

“...you're only fooling yourself."

The article "Where Is Itacism Going'.’H in the

deserves comment from “the other side." I
shall begin by saying that it was poorly written

The ideas suggesting that black students
“have more money than you do" is non-
realistic. If you are referring to the stipends
($20 every 2 weeks—usually on Monday), they
are not delegated to all EOI’ students and all
students who receive them are not black. The
students who receive these stipends do not
have sufﬁcient family income to provide for

personal needs.

The reason We dress better than you do is
because we have better taste than you do.

It was also stated that “and when the check

"ASP...our ‘Liberal Racist of the Year'..."

Though it is only February, SDS feels conﬁdent in awarding the
ASP our “Liberal Racist of the Year" commendation for its fine
analysis presented From the White Side. This article belongs with
such great works as Prof. Jensen“proof" that black people are
genetically inferior (so for the good of mankind must be kept
from breeding their defects any further) and History 131 B,
taught here at SUNYA, which rises the works of the great and
all-knowing Voltaire, whose wisdom teaches that Blacks are a

subhuman species, obviously inferior to white men.

It is easy to see why Governor Rockefeller believes in spending
so much money for higher education. After all, any system which
teaches the ideology to which he owes his personal fortune
(racism, sexism, anti-working class ideology and most important
that ALLsAMERICAN liberalism which grants a person the ‘right'

to be racist) surely is worth spreading at any cost.

The article's arguments bear striking resemblance to those used
to attack welfare: People (Blacks) on welfare are dumb baby

machines, people (Puerto Rieans, Orientals)

on welfare take

advantage of hard working tax payers (Whites), welfare is
Un-Americnn. The ending follows with the rest of the article and
can be paraphrased "America, we’ve done it now, we gave the
Blacks a few crumbs (more than we fed the pigeons, right Henry?)
and look what has happened, they threw it back in our faces.

Such ingratitude."

FIGHT RACIST UNEMPLOYMENT

“...peoplc generally on this campus are snotty...”

by Al Thompson
ASP Features Staff

Let’s face it, Albany State is just
messed up, racially, socially, and
politically. The campus scene is
off campus. Even if there weren't
any Blacks on campus, Albany
State would be clickish, dull and
with less color to say the least.

It is openly admitted that insti-
tutionalized racism exists here but
nothing is being done to correct
the situation. No, wearing buttons
like “Love is the only way" is just
too superﬁcial. Almost as bad as
wearing one saying “Kill the
Pigs." I agree there isn't any mass
type of White and Black relations,
these have to be made individual-
ly, but there isn't any type of
White to White relationship either,
when it comes to social and poli-
tical action. This I personally wit-
nessed at an anti—Laos rally.

In reference to the article
printed Friday, “Where is Racism
Going," a common attitude was
revealed: "I'm not anti-Black, but
I don't like snotty people, and ii
lot of Blacks are snotty." Wow,
haven't people gotten hip to the
fact that people generally on this
campus are snotty, and light?

The second most common atti-

tude expressed in the article, held
greatly by white students is about
the BOP program. “The EOI’ Pro-
gram is great intellectually. When
it gets down to an emotional level
it hurts. They haVe more money
to spend than I do. They even
dress better than I do. And when
the Check comes they run off to
buy a stereo." ~~Great generalizat-
lions, but a lot of Blacks do tend
to be better dressers than whites
simply because of the cultural
“clean look" [but they projecl.'l‘lu-
stereo bit, I‘m still wondering
about, I haven ’t gotten mine yet.
Most of the noise I hear nl four

t't's.

living as objective as I can.

I'm not anti-(lrcek, “some of my
best friends arc:" nor anii-seinilic,
“I love Kosher food" but Albany
Stale has too much of II Long
Island and (lrcck atmosphere.
"The same people, the same
crowd, that acl, talk, and dress
alike."

Imaginc lllnsc white students
here whosc old man owns slum

in the ghettos and
charges the occupants above nor-
mal rent for living in a condemned
building with no real services,
except roaches and rats. Imagine
those white students here whose
old man exploits Blacks and other
lower-class people daily in their
businesses to send little Johnny
and Sue to Albany State. The half
hasn‘t been told, these are only
samples of how little Johnny and
Sue get to college on the ex-
ploited toll of others. Maybe it is
only due to Blacks and other
oppressed people the privilege
enioying the fruits of the
majority‘s labor for onca.

No, I‘m not justifying or moral—
izing, if Blacks had the ﬁnancial
backing and educational oppor»
tunities as most of their white
have bad, there
wouldn't be any need of the EOI’
Program. What society has sown
in the past it is reaping now.

True, it has been a superficial
utopia on campus this fall and
no great upheaval,
but we are reminded by this Bibli-
cal quote which I look out of
context: “they should say peace,

utter chaos."

“Whitey can't stand to be ignored.”

I am a racist! Does this worry
you? If it does, you have the
wrong concept of what a racist is.
An astrologist studies the stars; a
geologist studies the earth, and a
racist studies his race of people. I
am a Black racist and I don't have
the time to worry about Black-
White relationships on this cam-
pus,

Many whites suffer from a su-
periority complex. When Blacks
do not cringe; when whites are
present, the whites can not handle
it. This is quite evident in an
article I read by Micheal Lippman
(Feb. 12 ASP). He states “The
EOI’ program is great—intellectu-
ally. When it gets to an emotional
level, it hurts. They have more
money to spend than Ido. They
even dress better than I do. And
when the check comes they runn
off to buy a stereo."

I feel that I must clear these
statements up. EOP spelled back-
wards is POE. Due to the fact that
the students don't have a great
deal of money, they tend to spend
it on necessities. They don‘t buy a
pair of $l 5 jeans to tear and then,
put patches or pour Clorox on
them, As far as clothes are
concerned Black people have al-
ways dresscdll There is no place

in the world where a person can
buy a $20 stereo!

Many whites try to justify their
actions. They base their actions
on the actions of the Blacks.
Michael Lippman states, “I'm not
anti-Black, but I don’t like snotty
people, and a lot of Blacks are
snotty." Here, instead of saying,
"I don’t like Blacks," he takes the
ccward’s way out. Only an infer-
ior person can be a coward, and
Blacks are not cowards!

Whites naturally think that
Blacks are belligerent. The truth
is: Blacks only respond when
something is said or done that
they feel is derogatory. You can
abuse people for so long and
eventually they will turn on you.
Blacks have turned away from the
whites. Whitey can't stand to be
ignored. They want attention no
matter what the cost. The cost is
great!

There are many Blacks who feel
the only way they can relieve
themselves from oppression
whould be to “kill all the Whit-
eys." I feel this is not necessary.
The white man is slowly killing
himself. Every time he opens his
mouth, he has to swallow the
poison of his words. Maybe he
will shut up only to survive!
