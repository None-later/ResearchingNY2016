EAR TO THE THUNDER

 

 

by Arlene Scheurer

Want. to hear an oft. ill used
word? New. But that's what dcs-
cribes Tony Williams Lifetime's
new album Turn it Over (Polydor
24-4021). The power is beyond
imagination, the combination of
the beauties of rock and jazz
complete, the talent supreme.

Tony Williams has long estab-
lished his greatness with the Miles
Davis quintet. Being a member of
one of the most. important of jazz
groups at the age of 19 is nothing
to scoff at. His incredible tech-
nique, his soulful, pouring, driving
force, his ﬂashy, striking, oner-
gotic colors are all well focused on
here.

Jack Bruce’s reputation with
Cream won‘t. be lost here. ilc
creates a nice foundation. John
McLaughlin introduces new ideas
on guitar. He will be u now forcc
on his instrument. Khalid Yasin
(Lorry Young) on organ, has some
nice solo moments, but his accom-
paniment (if such a tnmc phrase is
appropriate) is beautiful.

he only reservation I have

lar to Schoenberg‘s apccclminging
technique. it becomes boring after

playing in a supermarket, or dur-
ing a light conversation with a
friend cannot be used. it is this
type of music that is antrart. it
cannot surprise, or excite or cxhi~

albums that are that kind of pro-
duct.

All the requirements for easily
ignored music are in these albums.
Early in the Morning (Polydor

tions rlrnincd out, an unimagin-
ativc drummer who reads cliches
from his chart, syrupy strings,
and, in Early in Ihc Morning. a
choral group that sings in tired,
drop harmonics.

There is little use in describing
each song as they have bcen for-
mulated to the point of losing all
individuality. Huntcr Kullmun's

"Bec Gees’ At The Palace:
Quality, Not Quantity

by Jeff Burger

There are a few things that I want to say about this concert and they are
as follows, neatly grouped and categorized for filing or whatever:

I. Crowds, lines, vibes. moods,
names, etc. Dept.

(Pete Jackobs and Charles
Krletc, if by chance or cosmic
accident you’re still reading my
reviews, you might want to skip
this section.) Anyway, It should
be said that the concert began
late, and in conjunction with this
minor bringdown there was a fair-
ly major bringdown at. the door in
the forth of mass pushing and
shoving to get in; I saw a few
people get almost crushed and
that sort of thing. Later, these
lame people who were in posses-
sion of such together manners at
the door, kept it up inside. They
yelled and shouted requests all
through the Bee Gees set: they
were very noticeable during the
ballads (unfortunately). On the
other hand, they were enthusiastic
(there were at least three standing
ovations) and excitement is what
a rock concert is all about, but
then excitement has nothing to do
with being rude. It should be
notcd that I'm not talking about
the whole audience; also that the
reason for the late start. was not
the fault of the promoter, the
groups just weren't ready in time.

2. Supcrshow

A preview of the film
Strpcrshow was givon. (The film
will be shown in full on Friday,
Saturday and Sunday and a com-
plete review will appear after

wards. For now, just a mention
that it looks fantastic. Good co-
lor, excellent photography, good
sound (loud), good music.

3. Staple Singers

Good ol' Pop Roebuck Staples
and his three daughters. Pop must
be well into his forties—at. least—
and there he was plugged into an
electric guitar and telling us to get
it on. And he didn't look ridicu-
lous as you might expect. (instead,
some of us looked ridiculous, be-
cause he was able to “gel: it on"
better than alot of us. ) He was
really young and alive. The daugh-
ter who sang lead had a deep and
flexible voice which covered a lot
of range and carried well; the
harmonies delivered by her two
sisters were smooth and pleasant.
Early in their set, I was
disappointed in the group's back
up, a three man group which
seemed rather lifeless and added
nothing to the presentation. How-
ever, I had to change my mind
later on when they warmed up
and showed what they could do.
Among the group‘s numbers were
“For What it's Worth",“Give A
Damn", and “ The Weight", all
well presented in forceful gospel-
blues.
4. Bee Gees

First of all, it turned out to be a

fifteen piece orchestra instead of u
thirty piece as advertised and no

’l‘n Jclf Burger:

As instilling to you as Jacob's
lullcr was, there was an awful lot
of hard truth contained within,
whilc your reply was both super-
ficinl and innuccuratc.

Itcvicws are opinions, as you
say, but they should he substan-
Liatcd opinions, giving insight—
bcyond the more surface—about
Lhc ohjcct bcing rcvicwcd. As an
English major you are surely
nwnrc of Eliot's criticism of
[Ia/trio! He didn't mcrcly say it
failed, but carefully explained
why it lnilcd, Lhus, agrcc with hitn
or not, you hot-arm! conscious of
now clcnu-nis in the play. Any

Your cunsutncr guide argument

is clever, but misses the real point.
Someone who disagrees with your
opinion on one album will not
necessarily disagree on another.
What is important is your under-
lying values that lead you to your
conclusions themselves. For ex~
ample, if you like Chiago because
it has jazz elements well into-
gratcd into u rock context and
your reader likes to hour music of
that type, then he will find your
column worth while.

As far as your writing about
crowds, police, ctc. bcing relevant
because rock is u “sociological und

all art music. So any music will

one knows why. Fifteen In all
there were, that’s all. No matter.
The Bee Gees were really beau-
tiful to pay an orcheatra, they
Won’t. perform unleu they can do
it right. The three brothers who
dominate the proceedings were all
in ﬁne form. , ‘

The concert was conceptually
similar to the Moody Blues con-
cert “ State last. spring. They
stoyeﬂ away from improvisation
or extended numbers. They stuck
to familiar material, seeking to
reproduce the sound they obtain
on album, only live. And, like the
Moodies, they succeeded well; the
sound was staggering. To take a
song like "Lonely Day, Lonely
Nights", their new single and re-
produce the polished record ver-
sion on stage complete with or-
chestration— well, it‘s no small
achievement. Yet without the litu-
dio benefits of echo chambers,
overdubbing, retakes, etc., they
still succeeded completely. Their
voices were as ‘full and as beauti-
ful as on record: you‘re left think-
ing, my God, they really can sing
like that, that really is the way
they sound!

For some reason, the
Bee Gees were not. satisfied with
’the sound and they left after a set.
that was somewhere around an
hour in length (a bit. less or more;
i didn't time it. and don't. want to
quote a number...in any case, it
was too short, at least for anyone
sitting in a $5.50 seat.) Though
the last few songs all got standing
ovations, the group was gone in a
flick of the eye and heading down
the ihruway to New York.

5. Hype & Editorial Dept.

The Bee Gees are a top act. One
of the reasons that they left early
was the small audience. The thea-
trc was less than half full. There
are something like 80 times more
people in New York than there
are in Albany; maybe we just.
don’t have the numbers to sup-
port a weekly concert setup. 0n
the other hand, maybe we do. All
the other Bee Gees concerts on
their tour are sell-outs. This one
should have been: it was the ﬁrst
concert of their first American
tour in years.

if you do like to go to concerts,
and you're lucky enough to have
some money, the Palace is plan-
ning Byrds, Elton John, Hot
Tuna, etc. if nobody goes. that'll
bc it. if the place stays 50% full,
and the promoter keeps losing
money, it will close. Period. (Mor-
ul: if you want to go, go. If you
don't, don’t.)
