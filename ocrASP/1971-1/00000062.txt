School of Nursing:
Stresses Variety

by Walter Keller ,

Established in September, 1967, the School of
Nursing has received little publicity. The school is a
regular departmental program, leading to a Bachelor
of Science degree in nursing. As in any other
departmental program, students enter the program
immediately upon being accepted to Albany.

The idea of establishing a school of nursing at
Albany stemmed from a study made by nurses in
the area, showing that a school of this nature was
sorely needed. Consequently, Albany State was
selected.

The curriculum consists of 120 semester hours,
spread out over a four-year period. This is composed
of 64 credits in Nursing, as prescribed by the school,
3 credits in Communication, 25-27 in Science and
Math, 21 credits in the Social Sciences and Human-
ities, and 15-17 elective credits. Thus a nursing
major builds a strong and varied background, which
she can later relate to her role as a nurse.

A great deal of a nurse‘s instruction is in clinical
work, which begins in the sophomore year. This
consists of experience in regular hospitals and
institutions in the area, St. Peter's and Child’s
Hospitals to name two. Instructors accompany the
students and combine lecture material with first
hand experience in patient care and assessment. The
program follows a pattern in which more clinical
work is done each year, with fewer non—nursing
courses.

According to Dr. Major, Dean of the School of
Nursing, there are about a hundred students now

enrolled in the program, with thirteen graduates
expected in May. Looking to next year, approx-
imately 250 applications to the school have been
already received, a great increase over the past few
years. Dr, Major said that this was due to a new
admissions policy which allows applicants to state
their intention of entering the School of Nursing on
their regular college applications. At present all of
these people cannot possibly be accommodated,
however, until the extension of the West Podium.
At that time, possibly 350-400 students can be

handled.

Tomorrow?

Now every night on Mondays
and Wednesdays and Fridays, too,
the classrooms and hallways in the
Hunter College-Bellevue School of
Nursing rumble with the deep
resonant voices of student nurses
who sport a sprinkling of mus-
taches and gontees and bald heads
and who, in total, could be a
husky and muscular, if aVerage,
football squad.

For these studean are grown
men, almost 100 of them, engaged
in an innovative experiment with
two main goals:

—To help overcome a critical,
nationwide shortage of nurses.

-—To train policemen and fire-
men to become full-fledged regis-
tered nurses—RN's-so they can
have second careers after they
retire as early as age 110, or later.

The program, an idea of Dr.
Joseph A. Cimino, began last Sep-
tember and involves 13 hours of
evening classes a week. The men
will take 2% years to complete it.

When he proposed to individual
firemen and policemen that they
become nurses, “their first reac-

‘Ah, that's just for

But I argued that nursing is a
profession offering very interest-
ing challenges. Nurses are taking
on more responsibility in coron-
ary care and intensive care units,
for example. They are actually
practicing more medicine now.
There is more electronics in medi-
cine, and lots of opportunities for
interesting jobs in hospitals, and
in community health projects."

The need for more nurses has
become chronic due to the heavy
turnover in the field. Girls who
become nurses may marry within
three to five years—“that‘s about.
the time from diploma to prcg-
nancy"—and many do not return
to nursing after their children are
grown. lf young man could be
induced to become nurscs~as
Cimino and others hopc—“onc

actual working years during his
carccr."

Though the schedule is quite
heavy, only one man has dropped
out so far. And some 65 police
mun and firemen have already
signed up for the second course

body" and the absolute beauty of
Orphan’s idealistic dream world.

monies, Potemkin, played by
Michael Reynolds, and a group of
Revelers, a dancing chorus, who
also assist and comment on the

At The Palace:
Williams and Supershow

b y Bill Brine

The Palace is a vast
improvement, acoustically.
visually, and tactically , over the
gym or the Armory, and regular
jazz and rock concerts there
would be a welcome boon. The
rspotty attendance, which the MC
seemed to imply was a sign that
Albany doesn't want to support
such an effort, can be attributed
to the fact that tickets were una-
vailable. If N.S.P. can get tickets
to the outlets well in advance of
the shows they’ll sel|--thc Bechcs
did n't because they're not a draw,
No one's heard from or seen them
in years. That's typical. The
sound system, whichthe MC said
was the Lifetime's and was
brought up from NYC didn‘t
Work well for Dreams and was

only slightly better for the Life-
timc itself.

Dréams, a new jazz-rock ensem-
ble of the EST-Chicago mold from
NYC opened the show. Trumpeter

andy Brecker was an original
BS'I'er and that influence shows.
The 8 piece ensemble (guitar,
bass, piano or organ, drums, trum-
pet, sax, trombone, singer-per-
cussionist) is vastly more promis-
ing, though. They swing the
rhythms are tight, infectious, and
free, and the interplay of instru-
mcnts, riff‘trading, and soaring is
immensely enjoyable. The multi-
-percussion jamming that often
occurred would be dynamite in a
large, packed theater, but just
failed to catch fire in the small,
spread-out environs of the Palace.

The band's weakness is their

Winter Wonderland
At Fillmore East

by Stephen Aminoff

The band, a rather tight band,
plays an absorbing two hour sci at
New York's major rock pit, the
Fillmore East. The performance
by this combination of rock and
COUNTY essences, called Hot
Tuna, is interesting and yet some-
what subdued.

The set ends and cries resound
from all corners of the concert
hall for more. The return to the
slagc by the musicians is as
prompt as it is expected but onto
the stage walks a scvcnth musi«
clan. His face and eyes as snow
white as the electric strobe which
announces his presence. His long,
thin fingers cradlc the guitar he
has made love lo so many times in
so many ways. Johnny Winter is
here to jam.

What follows is rock and roll,
Winter's prcscncc uplifting the
spirits of all. 'l‘rying as hard as
possible to avoid the inevitability
of slcnling the concert, he waits
for nods from Hot Tuna guitarist
.iorma Kaukoncn and proceeds to
bleed his incredible talan onto
guitar, through some alivc, almost
effortless riffs. His union with
guitar now completed, the whole
audicncc is captivated by the
sound.

For The
Byrds...

concert being held tonight at the
Palace Theater does not sell con-
siderably better than previous con-
certs, this will be their last pro-
duction of this semester. Poor
attendance in the last few weeks
may force cancellation of such
scheduled acts as HotTuna, Elton
John, ’I‘cn Ycan; After and others.

One interesting confrontation
tach placc bctwcen elder status-
man of the Chicago blues (inns
Papa John Crunch, an incredible
clcctric violinist who opened
many cyes at the last Jefferson
Airplane concert here, and
Johnny, also no stranger here.

It was great to have these two
musicians, both of whom are
much older than most people
think, going at blues and rock
with the fervor of youth. They
could take a soft Hot Tuna crowd
to the heights of rock and take
the back just as easily.

Johnny Winter's own musical
necompanimcnt has changed
somewhat over the years, but the
music is still unmistakable. The
night before the jam, Johnny did
a gig on Staten Island with his
own band called "Johnny Winter
And", the “And” meaning Rick
and Jimmy Derringer and Randy
Z, all former members of the
McCoys(of "Hang on Sloopy" and
“Fever” fame).

These musicians whom Johnny
worked with extensively Since his
most able sidcman and brother,
Edgar Winter created his “Pure
Trash", are a truly able comple-
ment to Johnny's genius. The
guitar duels between Derringer
and Winter have become legend-
ary. Their only album together,
"Johnny Winter And" is an excel:
lent studio recording of the gutsy
show that can be seen live. More
interesting than that, it gives some
keen insight as to where these
musicians and maybe musicians in
general have their head at now.
The album flows beautifully
from “Am 1 Here", soft meta-
physical journey to the fore
boding talc set to the exciting
music of “Prodigal Son". Johnny
wraps it up with his "Funky
Music”, as he tells you where his
“high” experience has come to be.
So catch him while you can,
“Goldilocks” is into good things.

material--mostly original, mostly
mediocre, if not worse. One num<
ber, “Farewell, Suzanne" is OK--

-nothing great but it is a fine
vehicle for what Dreams does, and
one blues number highlighting
fine harp and vocal work by the
lead singer and a BB King-style
solo by the guitarist should stay,
but the band would benefit
greatly if it junked the rest of its
material and picked up on some
of Laura Nyro’s, Nick Gravenits‘s
and others‘ music.

Then came the Tony Williams’s
Lifetime-Tony Joe Williams on
drums, John McClaughlan electric
guitar, Jack Bruce electric bass,
and Larry Young (Yhalid Kussim)
electric organ. 'Their music
reminds me of Miles' (Tony was
Miles drummer) in both the brill-
iant perfection of the musicianship
with which it is performed and
the artistic vision which underlies
it. This is, simply, space music,

The Lifetime creates a
maelstrom in which Africian
rhythms, soaring guitar riffs, in-
crcdibly free, abstract bass
rumbles, and science-ﬁction
biceps rise and fall. Each member
of the Lifetime is a master of his
instrument, and each member
merges gracefully in a glistening
musical whole.

The only jarring note of the
performance came when Jack
Bruce brieflyattempted, no doubt
to please the Cream fans, to sing.
Too much touring and too much
of the evil and infamous weed
have racked Jack’s voice past sal-
vation.

Lifetime is struggling to gain the
acceptance it needs to survive, and
Jack's infrequent singing appeared
to be an attempt to throw a sop
to the audience. I don't think
that's what‘sinecessary; Lifetime
can gain the following it needs to
survive and prosper without, I
hope, that kind of commercializ-
ing. If not, that will speak reams
of the level of their'audience.

And then (3AM) came Super-
Show! Arrgh! This hour and a half
porpourri had one saving grace; it
ought to introduce a lot of teeny-
boppers to Roland Kirk,who is
featured with his own band and in
jams with others in a London
club, where the whole mess was
filmed. When Roland departs,
however, the film dies.

The sound gave way several
times, thankfully, once, in the
middle of Led Zeppelin doing
"Dazed and Confused" and
massacring music as per usual.
Carol, my companion, whose

previous knowledge of Kirk con-
sisted of an exposure to the “Rah-
saan, Rahsaan" album (total in-
comprehension) went, more or
less,“0h, that's what he's all
about!" Minus Kirk, Supershow is
asuperdud.

Trudging uptown in the met at
4:15 in the morning was
alright, too. Downtown is almost
likeuble when it‘s deserted.
