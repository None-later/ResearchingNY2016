ESP; or Extra-Sensory Pollution

Physicists tell us there are three basic forces at work in the uni-
verse: matter, energy and chopped liver.

But I, for one, am no longer satisfied with this narrow definition.
How do physicists classify ESP? Certainly it falls into none of these
categories, but just as certainly it l'ri'sfs. And not as a mere flicory; ESI’
is a prai'cti, demorisirufedfucf.

For example, how many times have you walked into a place you
never saw before and yet recognized everything? How many times have
you known the exact words someone was going to say before he ever
said them? How many times have you been ffllh‘lllltff'l” r'r‘rfuin some-
thing was going to happen hundreds or evert thousands of miles away
and, sure enough, it did?

Let me tell you about a case I am fortunately able to document.
Some years ago I went fishing with my dear friend Donald L. Fromkiss
at a virgin lake deep in the Canaditut wilds. It was hellishly difﬁcult to
get there, but we did not mind, for the moment we dropped our lines
we each caught a splendid crappie. Mine weighed just over-#100 pounds.
Donald's was somewhat smaller, but by far the friendlier.

Imagine my surprise then when, before we could throw our litres
back for another try, Donald suddenly li-apctl up and rricd he'd had a
premonition that he must go home immediately. He could not tell me
why. He only knew that some mic or some ﬁring was t'tlillllg hint back
and he had to go at. once. Apologiziug profusely, he left mc alone on
tiie lake and portaged to the nearest town (Moose .law, well over a
thousand miles, and poison sumac i-vcry lllt'lll, and there in: chartered
:i Ford 'l‘ri-Motor and flew homo.

Well sir, at ﬁrst he felt like an llllt'l‘ doll. I'lvcrything was pi-rfi-i-tly
normal at home. Ills wife I‘Itlith was quietly ri-ading 'f‘lic Srnsuous
li'murni. l-lia sort Herschel was taking his daily glassblowing lcsson.
Ills (log 'I‘rey was eating his leash.

.-\rul yet the premonition would ttoi ll‘il\'l' Donald. (Tart-fully, he
went through the house, inch by inch, room by room. Sure cnniigh,
when he got to the back hall lic suddenly licard a faint whimpering
noise outside. llc flung tillt‘ll the door. .-\nd there, by (icorgc, llI' saw
where the whimpering was cornittg front: someone had left a lniskct on
the back stoop!

Well sir, who can blame Donald for trying a cry of joy and tri-
umph'.’ What a find! A whimpering basket ! 'l'hal‘s somcthing you don't
see every day, let me tell you!

And so today, as you know of course, Donald 1., ll‘rltlllliiﬁs and
His Whimpering Basket is one of the highest paid acts in show busi-
ness. Next Sunday, in fact, he completes his H-lth consecutive year on
Ed Sullivan.

 

As for me, I too was a beneficiary of Donald‘s ESP, for when ill!
left me alone on the lake I figured I would get to drink uli- not just
huff—of the goodly supply of Millf'l' High Life llccr we liiid brought
along, and as you know of course, MiilL-r lligii Life is never so wr~lcome
as it is on a tranquil syivan lake while a flock of Canada geese darkens
the sky above. of course, Miller isn't bad in a noisy liar t'llllt‘l' while a
flock of American coeds darkens the jukebox. For that matter, It's even
great in the dorm while your cruddy roommate darkcrui the tiili.

But as it happened, I never did get to drink all our Miller High
Life because I forgot how well sound travels across a ayivtin lakc. No
sooner did I pop my first cart of Miller wheu‘lo arid Iicitoldl-~ tcn
Mounties galloped out of the forest singing selections from [four Mum!
Of course, I shared my Miller with them, artd gladly, lit-cause I know
it's hard being a Mountio, especially if you're an alto. And so by the
time they polished off my Miller and said adieu, We were all last frit-nda.
On" of them, in fact, let me slide down his hat.

Spring Sports
Face New Sched

by Lawrence H. Poltl

"The effects of the shortened
calendar year on the spring sports
season will be minimal," This is
the statement received from
Coach Joe Garcia, assistant direct-
or of athletics, iit ait intcrivcw to
the ASP Friday.

Although no serious problems
are expected to arise, Mr. Garcia
did cite several possible repercus-
sions due to the cltange.

“The only possivlc conflict I sec,
as far as the SUNY conferenci- is
concerned, will be with varsily
tennis,"said Coach Garcia. ’I‘hc
tennis finals in the confcrcncc art-
at the same time as filial exams.

Garcia also noted that extra
funds will be needed for room and
board on campus for participants
in post season tournaments. in
fact, the NCAA track tournament
is not until early June. This brings
up the problem, if our atlilctcs
should qualify, of keeping training
and fitness at a competitive pctik
for it month or so.

Couch Garcia went on to say
that besides starting a wcck or so
earlier, the shortened season will
have little effect.

“We (lid have to crowd things a
little but the kids know this and I
don‘t think it. will present a prob-
1cm.”

The new calendar also concerns
Truck Coach Bob Muitscy and
Tennis Coach Merlin Iliilhawuy.
Munsey expressed concern us to
the number of injuries which may
he suffered early in the season due

to the cold weather.

Because of the Wed-
.-Sti1.-Wc(l. ~Sut. sequence of
meets, Coach Miinscy fears some
of the injuries won‘t have the
propcr time to heal.

“Times arc going

added Mtutscy.

Coach Hathaway's main concern
was that with the crowded sched-
ulc as it is this spring, “the boys‘
first time outsidc will probably be
in competition." Finding
adequate indoor facilities will be a
continued prohlcm.

Both Garcia and liltinscy men-
tiniti-rl the possibility of southern
trips to avoid lilt‘ curly cold
weather meets.

“In order for such trips to take
place", (iai‘cia notctl, wc hrch lo
gt-l mom-y from litt‘ Allilcln'
Board, fund raising projccts, and
cooperating sclltitils, Ill addition
to contributions from sllltit'ltl.s

The Albany State Great Danes
remained in contention for a
post-season tournament bid with a
strong 77-58 victory over South-
em Connecticut State College last.
Wednesday night. The win was
State‘s seventh in a row, and
upped the team‘s overall record to
14-5.

The game began on an ominous
note for Albany as forward Alan
Reid picked up two quick fouls
within the first four minutes. The
visiting Owls dominated play in
the early going until Albany took
the lead on a three point. play by
Jack Jordan with 10:22 left in the
half.

State titcn went on to open a
five point spread, but that was
quickly erased by Southern
Connecticut's pressing defense
which led to three quick baskets
at the end of the first half to put
the Owls in front, 3-1-27.

'I'hi- Danes played lhcir bi-st
basketball after intermission.
'I‘hcy whittled down Southern
Connecticut's lead on bitskcLs by
Jim i\'lasl.crson aitd Reid, and then
took l.l1l‘ load with 11:51) remain-
ing in the half on a field goal by
John Quattrochi. Quattrochi put
on one of the fines shows seen in
the Albany gym since the days of
Rich Margison as he tallied 17
points in the second ltalf and 2-1
for the game, on an assortment of
driving layups and onc-handers.
Along with Masterson and DaVc
Wi-lchons, he broke the Owls'
bothersome press which had
caused fourteen turnovers in the
first half,

The Danes went ahead for good
with I-l:l-l left in the game on a
field goal by Jordan. They
strctt'ltcd it to twelve points with
seven minutes remaining, but the
Owls promptly poured itt sevcn
quick points to trail, 63-58, with
21-15 showing on the clock. Those
were the last points the visitors
were to score as Albany wcnt on a
1-1-0 tear to wrap up the 77-58
victory. Quitt- appropriately, tltc
final basket was scored by
Quattroclti, his tcnth hoop from
thc ficld of thirteen attempts.

'i'hc Danes also received fine,
doublc-figurc performances from
Jordan with 1'2 points, Reid with
cicvcn, and Mushroom and Stevc
Hhcchun with ten points apiece.

The visitors held a slight edge,

first half despite Troy Moss' itc-

on the heels of an incredibly
impervious defense arid an incred-
ibly 1101 Troy Moss, the Frosh led
at halftime, 44-35.

The second half saw llartwick
adjust to the Albany zotic, Albany
go back to the man to man, and
the score changed hands repetit-
cdly. With 2:110 left to go, the
Dunc I’ups led by nine, 75-66, and
at 1:011, by five, 77-72. And then
llu- wild last minute went some-

missed the foul shot. Reggie Smith
