Ear To The Thunder

 

 

by Arlene Scheurer

MARRYING MAIDEN It's a
Beautiful Day (Columbia CS
loss

The violin has become an inte-
gral part of rock music recently
with the recordings of Sugarcane
Harris, Papa John, Doug Kershaw,
among others, helping to popular-
ize the instrument. David
Laflamme, the lender of IT'S A
BEAUTIFUL DAY, a San Fran-
cisco band, is one of the more
intriguing violin players as well as
being an evocative songwriter and
a mellow singer.

The group's second album “Mar-
rying Maiden” ranges from the
syrupy Bosa Nova sound of “Let a
Woman Flow" to the happy,
stomping country “Hoedown” to
the 1890’s good time sound of “It
Comes Right Down to You.

Unlike their first album, "Marry-
ing Maiden" contains no real
stand out cuts. The only song that
could compare to “White Bird” or
“Girl With No Eyes" or "Hot
Summer Day" is Laflamme's ver-
sion of Fred Neil's "The Dol-
phins." Lat'lamme is no longer the
dominating figure he was, proba-
bly on his own will.

This album is definitely a let-
down after a great premiere al-
bum. if the group could achieve
more consistency at guitar and
keyboards to compliment La-
flamme’s Vocals and violin work
and the strong back-up vocals of
Pattie Santos, they could become
a powerful group. 1 look forward
to their next album, but as of now
they are on probation.

‘ﬁ'...lﬁtlﬂli.lﬁltilﬁl**

Dallas County (Enterprise ENT-
-1011) appears to be a group to be
listened to and reckoned with.

  

The performers are, for the most
part top notch and the arrangers,
especially Jay Pruitt, are able to
write varying charts bringing out
trumpet voicings particularly well.
Compare the more reservad trum-
pets in "Roads" to the more
brassy sound in “The Toll.” The
arrangements fit more aptly to the
body of the songs than do those
of the Blood Sweat & Tears
(Dallas‘ inspiration) and the result
is less contrivance and more soul.

Jaramillo is an excellent vocalist
with a deep, powerful voice, who
can really project. Ramsey Horton
has a nice solo on “The Toll," but
his combing as well as that of
guitarist Ken Pugh needs work.

This is a very exciting album and
group. At the moment they are a
little too derivative (lots of BS&T
and a smidgeon of Maynard Ferg-
uson). Should they acquire a
group identity they have quite a
future in store for them.

by Tom Quigley

The reported death of the old
Hollywood star system is totally
unfounded. it is always reassuring
to see older stars playing in
modern cinema but unfortunately
many of these ikons of the 40's
and 50's are relegated to roles as
father figures, mother types, or
kindly elders.

THERE WAS A CROOKED
MAN offers a bonanza of these
older stars in leading roles headed
by Kirk Douglas and Henry
Fonda, two of the best of a
dwindling breed. The vehicle,
however, is a poorly developed
and sometimes patently offensive
satire dealing with larceny and
brutality that separates the survi-
vors from the sheep.

The setting is the old west. but.
the plot offers pungent observa-
tions about penal reform and
greed that are just as applicable to
the human condition today. Kirk
Douglas portrays Paris Pittman

Jr., a soft spoken thoroughly des-
picable con man, who politely
robs his victims and casually be-
trays his OWn henchmen with

He is caught and repaid for his
wrongdoings against the Christian

escape with the help of a myriad

paints erotic Biblical pictures, a
silent strong armed Chinaman, a
handsome youth, and an old des-
peratc whose hobby is growing

The potential “relevancy” of the
story-line is blighted by the min-

oped. 'l'lic script by Robert

taking swipes at needed prison
reform, brutal subjugation and
homosexuality within prisons, and
two-faced Christian mores.

Yet this conscious, stylistic
imitation of M*A*S*H has none
of the humor or humanity inher-
ent in the war satire. All the
characters are thoroughly unre‘
deemable and this unsympathetic
treatment coupled with the super-
ficial observations makes it rather
unpleasant, depressing, and weak.

The actors are uniformly excel-
lent making the best out of their
individual badncss. Douglas is de-
ceptivc and cunning as Pittman in
contrast to the typical Henry
Fonda role as the morally straight
and sincere warden. l-lumc Cronyn
and John Randolph, as the gay
inmates, are frequently funny and
effective. Warren Oates, as the
drifter, is particularly strong and
always suspicious. Finally Burgess

 

Meredith, to whom i wish years of
continued health, is inspired as
the old Missouri Kid who has
resigned himself to a life of im-
prisonment.

Joseph L. Mankiewitz, whose
last effort was a forty million
dollar epic bomb entitled CLEO
PATRA, must be blamed for the
basic failures of his latest film. He
has returned from oblivion with
his ability to direct actors intact
but has seemingly lost all the
style, pace, and Verve he once
commanded as a top flight com-
mercial director in the fifties.

Finally the pop-jazz music score
by Charles Strouse is totally
inappropriate for a western fur
ther alienating an already over-
taxed audience. Even the consist~
cnttwisl al the end of the movie
cannot save THERE WAS A

Vol. tvm No. i2
Referendum to be Held

S.A. Constitution
Passed by Council

by Allen Altman

 

The newly proposed constitution of Student
Association was ratified by Central Council by a
lfiul-l vote after many hours of lively debate on
Thursday. The constitution will now be up for a
referendum on March 8, El, and it) whcrc it will have
to be approved by a 60% affirmatiVe vote with at
least 20% of the student body voting,

A major part of the debate ovvr the new
constitution ccntcred on the composition of the
council. A proposal to reduce faculty membership
from five lo four and give non-faculty personnel on
the University payroll in scat on Council was
defeated. An attempt was made to abolish voting
privileges thal faculty members on Council now
hch. Reasons cited for this were claims that
decisions of Council have no effect on faculty and
therefore faculty shouldn't hich the right to deter-
mine how Central Council spends tax money. A
349-3 vote killed this proposal.

Under the new constitution, the President of
Student Association will no longer be President of
Central Council or hold a vote on Council, Instead,
the next Council will elect a chairman to preside
over meetings. The feeling was that this will provide
for better separation between the legislative and
executive branches of Student Association thus
making it more democratic.

In the past, the President of Student Association
needed 40% of the student vote to be elected.
Under the new constitution a majority vote is
required. If a candidate fails to receive a majority
vote, a run-off election would be held between the
two top vote-getting candidates.

Attempts were made to limit the power that the
President of Student Association would have under
the new constitution. A 2/3 vote that the Council
needed to ovorridc a presidential Veto was changed
to a majority vote. The 2/3 Council vote previously
necessary to reject any policies and procedures
made by the President which it deemed inconsistent
with the best interests of the student body was also
changed to a majority vote.

Central Council urged that all students read the
new constitution before referendum days and get out
and vote on this important document that will run
the Student Association.

Doctor of Arts Program
To Train College Teachers

by Martha Natlianson

The State University of New
York at Albany is expected to be
the first institution in New York
State to award the Doctor of Arts
degree.

Prepares Students for
College Teaching
Although full final approval has
not yet been given, funds for the
endeavor have been granted by
the Carnegie Corporation and the
first students in this new grad uatc
program will probably begin in

will prepare students for a career
in college teaching rather than a
career in research with a PhD.

The Doctor of Arts Planning
Group, directed by Professor Ar—
thur N. Collins, began operation
last summer. They are working at
developing programs within the
College of Arts and Sciences and
in cooperation with the School of
Education. The program will at-
tempt to not only provide the
student with depth in his specific
subject matter but with a breadth
of knowlegc outside his major
dept, and with a specific orienta-
tion towards college teaching, and

practical experience in teaching.

Departments Planning
Institution of Program

Departmental committees are in-
volved now in planning for the
institution of this new program.
On February lb, thcI English, Eco-
noniics, and Physics Departments
presented their full-scale proposals
to the Graduate Academic Couri-
cil. The Council must vote on it
and paws it on to the University
Senate, and it then must go
through llu» 'I‘ruslces and the lie-
gents.

Proposals are in the works in the
departments of French and Span-
iin but first must receive depart-
mental approval. There have also
been proposals within the Math
Department, but they have been
temporarily shelved partly be-
cause of the difficulty for Ph.D.’u
to find jobs. There is also some
interest by some members of tliu
Biology Department.

A group of faculty members
from several departments is also
working to develop a proposal for

a Doctor of Arts in literature
which would be inter-disciplinary.

Recruitment

in the first year, SUNYA is
interested in recruiting students
qualified to begin doctoral work
but who are just beginning their
graduate study. For the beginning
of this program, six students will
probably be accepted in each of
the departments. They will be
recruited from all over the
country.

Dissertation Focuses on Issues
or Applications

The length of the Doctor of Arts
program would be four years,
including two years of coursework
beyond the baccalaureate, a year
for the dissertation, and a year of
internship at another school. The
dissertation would generally be
shorter than the usual Ph.D. but
would be focused on issues within
the discipline or on applications
of the discipline rather than an
original con tribution to
knowledge.

Program Offers Choice

Professor Collins stated that the
purpose of the DA degree is “not
to increase the number of doc-
torate degrees but to give the
entering graduate student an op-
portunity to choose whether to
prepare himself specifically for
college teaching or for a career in
research." The dissertation needed
for ii Ph.D. is often ii stumbling
block preventing many candidates
from completing their degree. The
DA is also seen as a positive step
in improving the much com-
plained about quality of college
teaching.
