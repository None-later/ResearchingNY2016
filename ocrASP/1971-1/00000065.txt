False ‘National Emergency’ Alert
Causes Panic and Confusion

(AP) - Scores of radio and
television stations went off the air
brieﬂy Saturday after receiving on
their news wires an erroneously
transmitted presidential proclama-
tion of a “national emergency."
The incident generated anxiety
and confusion across the coun-
try.

But the majority of stations,
suspicious of theI alert, continued
normal programming.

Many of the stations that left.
ll10.tllr did so after broadcasting
the emergency warning, triggering
llllntlt‘t‘tls of telephone calls fromi‘
excited, sometimes panic-stricken
listt-ttr-rs who feared the country
Was under attack.

The error was blamed on an
Army civilian technician using the
wrong piece of tape during, a rogu-
Iarly scheduled wot-lily test of the
nation’s defense warning system.
The tape used (lid not signify a

There have been is tremendous

to see it on the wire.

In Washington, aides said Secre-
tary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
ordered an immediate investiga-
tion of the incident.

Under the system, the President
is the only one who can order, or
cancel, the alert. But. a check with
the White House press ofﬁce when
the original erroneous signal was
flushed drew the response from an
aide that “nothing has come from
the President."

The Strategic Air Command also
ignored the alert and dispatched
no attack aircraft after it. was
received.

At Cheyenne Mountain, LJ.

Smnycr, the civilian in charge of

 

---simmons

the National Warning Center, said
a civilian working for the Depart-
ment of the Army was responsible
for the false transmission.

Cheyenne Mountain is headquar-
ters for the North American Air
Defense Command, but ofﬁcials
said Army personnel was involved
because the warning center is run
by the Army Strategic Communi-
cations Command.

A spokesmim for the American
Telephone & Telegraph Co, at
Colorado Springs, which provided
the center‘s system and leaSes the
news wires, said it was the first
nationwide failure of the program
since it was installed more than 10
years ago.

Carlson Denied
Tenure Issue Persists

   

by Bob Kanarek

It’s spring again, and student dissatisfaction with
decisions of tenure seems to be mounting. One case
in particular is the denial of tenure to Helen Carlson
by the English Department.

On Friday afternoon, a group of interested stu-
dents met. to discuss what actions could be taken to
reopen her case. In the opinion of these students,
Mrs. Carlson was denied tenure for petty reasons, as
she is, in their opinion, a fine teacher, who is at
once scholarly, widely published and very near
completion of her doctorate thesis.

The students seemed to feel that her teaching
ability, and aspiration of obtaining a doctorate has
been stifled by teaching an overload of lower level
English courses and by an instructor's salary, which
has caused her to teach night courses in a local
college.

After talking to many English professors, these
students have arrived at the conclusion that. many
of the tenured faculty who voted on Mrs. Carlson's
case, did not know her very well and could not.
fairly assess her as a teacher or person. Thus the .
purpose of reopening the case, would be a more
accurate evaluation of her abilities.

An important. aspect of this case is that the
students feel that Mrs. Carlson deserves tenure by
present standards. As she is widely published, the
question here is not one of changing the concept of
tenure to be more oriented to the teacher rather
than the researcher, but just the granting of tenure
to one who deserves it.
