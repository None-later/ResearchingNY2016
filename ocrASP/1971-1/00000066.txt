Communication

Friends

To the ASP and its readers:

This is regarding the many arti-
cles written to the ASP about
racism, in particular the one by M.
Griffith. I imagine that there is
going to be and, in fact, already
has been a lot of discussion on the
topic and some hard feelings on
both sides. We feel angered by the
letter written by M. Griffith
which is just as anti-white as she
accuses the other letter of being
ai'itrblack. We always felt equality
and not superiority by either side
was the goal. Blacks have always
said that they want what the
whites have (good jobs, homes,
education, etc.) and not that they
want more than the whites.

We never thought that in llieir

quest for a better life it t they
meant to suppress the whites
along the way. Isn't that the

opposite of the old cliche, trying
to make two wrongs equal a riglil.
We don't agree with the other
article either, that one was just as
racist as hers. You can not. correct
racism with the other extreme.

Also many white students work
all summer, vacations and take
out large loans to put tlieniselVes
through school. Most fathers do
not “exploit the blacks" to put
their children through college.

As a personal experience, last
week my friend and l were stand
ing in line for dinner when seven-
teen blacks cut in between us.
Have you ever seen seventeen
whites cut in line‘.’ Where is the
equality here? Is this an attempt.
by the black to make us servile to
tbem‘.’ if so, what is the point? To
increase anger, tension, and frus~
tration on both sides?

For our parts we hope that some
day there will be unity and equal~
ity for both. We don't want to see
this nation split into white racists
and black racists.

ONE BLACK AND ONE WHITE

And Friends

Hostility

To the Editor:

I agree that EOP is a good
program, that Blacks dress "sharp-
er" than whites (with or without
EOP funds), that Blacks do not
run off to buy stereos any more
than whites, but I also think Al
Thompson is missing the issue
when he says that “people gener-
ally on this campus are snotty and
tight."

Perhaps most people on this cam-
pua are cold, clickish and uncon-
cerned, but I would not term
campus people in general as being
“snotty.” Although I would not
call Blacks uanotty" either. l do
say that they are very hostile. The
difference is this: Snotty, I think,
implies a person acting “badly
because of a personality problem;
but a hostile person is acting often
out of friistration,whlch is caused

not by deficits in the person

himself but by outside interfer
ences in the realization of his
potentialities.

Blacks are hostile. But Whites
should stop to understand why
they are that way: over three
hundred years of constant oppres-
sion land things aren't getting
lietter) would make any race of
people frustrated, and conse-
quently, hostile.

So to all you Whites otit there:
Next time you feel that hostility
staring out at. your fromall those
black faces, try to remember who
put it there.

Does that seem like a big ordci“!
Well, so was

 

Irene Berry

Alternative to FSA

To the Editor:

A few weeks ago i wrote a
rather emotional indictiiieiil of
the Faculty Student Asst -iatioii.
My opinion of this organisation
has not changed. The unchrsity
would benefit from the destrction
of this corporation, but an alter»
natiVe method of supporting the
iiiiiVersity must be found.

Finding this alternative is not
difficult. ()iie reasonable solution
is to merely force this oppressive
corporation to lch tip to its name.
The management of this organiza-
tion should be controlled by the
students and faculty. A university
of the size of S.U.N.Y.A. has no
excuse for importing the manage-
ment of the corporation that con-
trols its lift-line. The university
community has more than enough
able people, who could manage
this organization.

Students and faculty members
should haVe the final say in all the
major dee'ions ol' the Fauclty
Student Association. The majority
of the control of this organization
should be given to the students,
because they are most concerned
with the doings of the association.
All responsible members of the
university communtiy should de-
mand control of this organization,
which controls the economy of
S.U.N.Y.A.

 

 

Eric Morrison
Apathy?

To the Editor,

My suitcmate and l were both
struck by the fact that all the
replies which appeared in Wednes-
day's ASP (2/17/7l) in response
to Lippman's article were from
black students, as was evulent
from the references made in all the
replies. I was very annoyed that
no letters from white students
appeared. Where are they? Don't
they have anything to suy'.’ Are
they that apathetic?

A great deal has to be said in
favor of the black people today.
They are not indifferent to the
situation. The fact that all the
Iott rs printed in the ASP were

 

from black students proves this.
They have realized their common
heritage and culture and have pro-
ceeded to flaunt it with the slogan
“Black is beautiful.“ They have
stopped struggling on an individ-
ual level and have joined "WWII"

to achieVe their goal. Howeven
their goal has gradually changed

from becoming assimilated into
and accepted within society on an
equal basis with the white man, to
becoming a nation completely
separated from the white man.

When one has been perse-
cuted and knocked down 2150an
as the black man has been, it is
very difficult to get back up again.
to remain calm and pcaceable, and
most of all, to tolerate and accept.
such treatment. Moreover, it is
wrong to accept such treatment
and it is good that the black man
inon't accept it. However, I think
that the way the black people-are
seeking to remedy the situation,
their goal of a separate black
nation, is wrong, and the manner
in which they are going about ll.
is also wrong.

Let me talk about the white
man for a minute. It is true that
he has persecuted the black man
unmereil'ully for centuries and it
is something every member of the
white race should be ashamed of.
Personally, I am truly humiliated
when I pass a black student and
smile at him only to receive a
glare in return; it really makes me
ashamed of my own color, But
there are white people who have
tlt't't'l' hated blacks in their lives
and they have dedicated them-
selves to working for black~white
equality and unity. They have
tried in the face of much tipposi
tioii and prejudice to help the
black man when the black man
wanted to be helped. The trouble
is that the black man does not
want to be helped by the white
man anymore; he wants to be
alone. The white man is beginning
to realize this and figures why
should he even bother to associate
with the black man when the
black man has shut off all lines of
communication. Many whites still
want to help the black people but
they are annoyed at the rejection
of their efforts (evr-n such simple
things as smiles), and the entire
attitude of blacks today so they
assume it is useless to even try
The white man too has given up.
This is the crux of Ilie problem.

It is up to each INDlVlDUAL,
bolli black and white, to TRY; to
'l'llY to work together; to TRY to
communicate with each other, to
TllY to live with each other in
harmony.

it is not impossible. We all lust
liaVe to adopt an attitude of try-
ing rather than an attitude of
giving up.

THIS is the mark of a true man,
whether he be a black man or a
white man; one who, even in the
face of difficulty, works peace-
fully for the good of all main; one
who always TRIES.

Constitutional Kickoff

After many years, a new Student
constitution has been passed by Central Council. The
bill now comes up for a referendum, to be held
sometime in March. At least 20% of the
undergraduate student body must particpatc in the
referendum and 60% of these voting students must

Association

approve.

Much shouting has been done in the past about the
lack of democracy in Student Association. The new
constitution goes along way towards remedying this.
with such "innovations" (for our S.A., at least) as
direct election of the President. direct clcclioii of all
members of Central Council. and the recreation of
botli MYSKANIA and the Supreme Court.

Rosencrantz & Guildenstern

A Post-Concert

by Jeff Burger

I‘m going to dismiss the concert
very quickly to giVe precedence to
an interview I had with McGuinn
afterwards. First, the concert.

CACTUS was loud, with a high
energy sound reminiscent of Led
Zepplin at their communications
breakdowncst, if you catch my
meaning, if you get my drift. At
times, pure power and raw
emotion can be all you want, all
you need out of rock music; other
times it's enough to give you a
headache.

REDEYE is a group of quite
talented musicians, three guitars
and drums; they appear to be very
comfortable with their material,
which was good country music.
Beautiful harmonies. Look for
some fine albums to come from
these people.

THE BYRDS did a short set
because the show was running
late. They began with “Lover of
the Bayou," the cut which begins

their live LP. Other numbers
included: a soft guitar “Mr.
Tambourine Man," and another
Dylan tune, “You Ain’t Going
Nowhere" (“You ain‘t going
nowhere, are you?“ asks
McGuinn, “Well neither is Bob
Dylan's song..."), “Take A
Whif ," (“Here’s a traditional
American Leadbelly folksong‘

"about dope"). There were a few

songs featuring Clarence White
guitar and vocal (“Truckstop
Girl"l and that was about it.

Which brings us rapidly to the
interview.

I had a long conversation with
Roger McGuinn, leader, founder
and only original member of the
Byrds. He had just returned from
the backstage ladies room where
the group had been drinking beer,
stomping feet and playing around
with some music. McGuinn was
in drunk, but he looked alright.
He was very friendly, no sarcastic
ansWers and superstar ego trip,
just a nice rap:

Roger McGuinn of the Byrds

JB: Why was the concert so short?

RM: We wanted to play longer,
they cut. us off, the contract was
for 2 Vi hrs., so the second show
will be a lot longer.

JB: Any plans for a new album?

RM: Yeah, we‘ve got one finished.
Ni. title yet. It could be a few
months before Columbia gets a-
round to releasing it.

.IB: Do you still see Dylan‘.’
RM: Yeah, sometimes we sit and
rap for like six or seven hours, just

me and him and his old lady.

JR: Which albums of his do you
like?

RM: i haven’t really liked any
the motorcycle a-

thing since
ccident. I liked Bringing It All

JB: Right, beautiful to

around dawn.

RM: Yeah, I like that too. We
used a moog on that. And on all
the albums since. I wrote “Space
Odyssey" before Kubrick‘s movie
came out. i didn't know anything
about the movie, but we got it all,
except the starchild, at the end.

JB: How did you manage to make
so many personnel changes and
yet keep your original sound'.’

RM: I pray at night.

JB: Any differences between the
original group and this one?

Youngbloods ,
Coming Soon to RPI

“...a splendid time is guaranteed
for all" says John Lennon com~
menting on Youngblood‘ con-
certs. The Youngbloods, along
with Sugarloaf and Jeff (lain, will
be featured at the RH Saturnalia
concert, Friday, February 26, at.
8:30 p.m. in the Rl’l Field House.
More and more people hich
turned off lately going to concert
after concert where big-name
groups blast their way through a
parade of hits. They would often
rather lay in bed and turn on their
stereo than to sit in a crowded
hall. What people want is a show
with really live entertainment.
This concert. sets cvorything in
its perspectivu. There are three
attractions; no big name groups
riding on their laurels and
"working" to collect their 25
grand, but three “on-Lhcir-way~
up“ attractions who "play" out a
concert like a concert should be
played— for the audience.
Although the Youngbloods' bit,-
gest hit, “Let's Get Together,” is
their showcase number, it does
not truly represent their sound
which is one of a softer, more
melodic, and extremely enjoyable
music—in the true sense of the
word “music.”
Stemming from their leader,
Jesse Colin Young, comes a mix

of folksy, rhythmic, disciplined
music. This is complemented by
Banana, whose classical piano train—
iiig gives a precise and truly gifted
instrumentation on electric piano
or guitar. The third member of
the group, Joe Bauer, had his
roots in jam. drumming, but he
has tempered his desires to fly on
the drums for the more familiar
rock drum sound. The latest mem-
ber of the group is Michael Kane,
whose good bass sound freed Jesse
(who used to play bass) to play
the acoustic.

The Youngbloods do not insult
the intelligence of their audienco.
They play a lively yet slightly
more sophisticated music than
you usually hear, for musically
educated listeners who are tired of
concerts with no taste or purpose.

Sugarloaf is presented with the
Youngbloods for a contrast in
sound. Whereas the Youngbloods
are soft and melodic, Sugarloaf is
melodic but more gusty. Their
driving sound is polished, as
shown in “Greencyed lady," but

hits a broader, more solid and
driving base to it. Each of the four
iiiusicians—Jerry Corbetta (key-
boards), Bob Webber (guitar), Bob
Raymond (bass), and Bob
MacVittlc (drums)-is an accom-
plished professional in his own
right. Put together in their disr
ciplined manner, they are striking.

Jeff Cain is reminiscent of a
cross between Arlo Guthrie and
Donovan. l‘lis songs are good—
really good-and his sense of hu-
mor is refreshing and is brought
out in several of his numbers. A
good friend of the Youngbloods,
his California style is worthy of
concert attention.

This concert is a "must" for any
rock fan who also loves true enter-
tainment. A fantastic and alive
music "show" is in store for the
audience because it is being per-
formed by groups who are enter-
tainers, not merely recording
artists.

Tickets are on sale now at the
RPI Field House Box Office or at
any Ticketro outlet;$2, $3, $4.
