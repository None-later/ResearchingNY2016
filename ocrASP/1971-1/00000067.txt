This past Saturday the team met
unbeaten Potsdam State, a very
tall and talented squad. Albany
never gave up and turned in a fine
performance in a losing effort,
19-39. Albany’s hustling defense
kept them in the game most of
the way as they quite effectively
stopped Potsdam's fast break.

 

Potsdam dominated the back-
boards, however, and this was the
big factor that gave them the
victory. High scorer for Albany
was Ler‘ie King with 8 points.

The girls' final home game will
be February 26 against Skidmore

Tourney Hopeful Danes Top Ithaca

 

  

Jack Jordon had his greatst night as a varsity Dane last Saturday.

scoring 31 points on thirteen field goals and ﬁve foul shots.

“do young

The scrappy Great Dane thmen
notched their eighth straight win
Saturday night against lthaca Col-
lege, by a score of 82-69. The
victory kept very much alive
Albany’s hopes for a post season
tourney bid.

Co-captain Jack Jordan poured
in his Varsity career high of 31
points in leading the Danes to
their eleventh victory in twelve
games. The six foot one senior
sunk 13 hoops from the field and
added five more from the foul
line.

State couldn't build up any kind
of a lead in the first half and. led
by only one at the half, 31-30.
John Quattrochi, who has been
the big gun for Albany of late,
picked up some early fouls and
was forced to the bench. The
junior from Fort Edward usually
provides the spark to the Dane
machine and so Jordan had to
play the "take charge" role in
John '5 absence.

The second half saw the Nettcrs
explode for 5i points, their sec-
ond straight 50-point plus second
half performance. The State five
had tallied 50 points in the second
half just threLI days earlier, against
Southern Connecticut. Jordan's
hot hand Saturday earned him 18
points in that second half while
the Dane man to man defense
completely handcuffed lthaca.

Albany began to pull away at
the very start of the second half,
building a 50-37 lead with twelve
minutes remaining. The biggest

Matmen Win 8th Straight;
Hull Still Unbeaten

by David Fink

Apparently, Wrcstling Coach Joe
Garcia's magic wand is still in fine
working order as his charges just
keep winning. Their Iatcst was a
29-11 win over Hrrrpur College for
their eighth consecutive victory.

The Danes had won their
seventh consecutive match Wed-
nesday against visiting New Paltz
and it seems as if everyone around
campus—both the team and the
students—have forgotten the two
opening season losses.

This win broke a 10-year varsity
record for consecutive victories
and also set a record for the most
wins in one season by a State
wrestling squad.

In the NH lb. class Tommy llull
registered a 2-2 tie. John Lutz
Won a very close 3-2 decision at
126 lbs. to put State in thil load.
Larry Frcdcricks (131) was the
only loser as he came out on the
short end of an extremely tight
2-1 margin.

The team's l.ri-captains-Jeff Al-
brecht, Jim Nightingale and Phil
Mims-continued to set fine exam-
ples for the rest of the squad at
142, 150 and 158 pounds re-
spectively. Albrecht pinned his
opponent, Nightingale took a 6-3
decision and Mims won by an
incredible 18-1 score. Cliff Wess
won the 167 lb. class ina3-0
decision while Al Mercer and Tim
Coons took the 190 lb. and

On Saturday the DllllL‘ Grapplers
traveled to Binghamton to face
l‘larpur College, and came away
ontlio top of a 29-11 scorc. Hull
remained undefeated at 118 lbs.
by decisioning his opponent, as
did tri-captain Jeff Albrecht(142)
and Tim Coons (190). Phil Mims,
who has also never lost in dual
meet competition, pinned his man
'in the 158 lb. weight class. Other
pins were registered by Al Mercer
(177), Cliff Wess (167) and John
Lutz (134).

Of course every win since Wed-
nesday is a record breaker. The
last dual meet of the campaign is
away against Oncontrr tomorrow.

spread of the night came at the
3:30 mark, as the Great Danes
boasted a 22 point bulge, 74-52.
The entire bench saw at least
some action, as the home five
coasted to the thirteen point. vic-
tory.

Under the boards, State took
the battle, 54-48. Jordan had
fourteen for the Danes, with Al
Reid and Steve Sheehan helping
with some very convincing re-
bound strength.

in addition to being Jordan's
finest offensive game, it was also
quite a night for sophomore Dave
Welchons. The easy going guard
brought the house down with
another beautiful behind-thc-back
assist on a fast break. Dave has
been showing more and more to
the appreciative SUNYA fans and
Saturday night’s performance

learned him his ﬁrst full-fledged
standing ovation when he was
taken out late in the game.

it was also a relatively satisfying
game for junior transfer, Bob
Rossi, as. he came in to shoot two
fouls for Steve Sheehan who had
been thrown out of the game for
fighting. Coming in cold off the
bench, "backyard" Bob calmly
peeled off his sweats, swished his
two points through, and received
a roaring standing ovation from the
Dane followers on his way back to
the bench.

As far as tournament hopes are
concerned, the Danes have going
for them the fact that they are
playing their best ball of the
season now, and this is some-
thing the Selection Committec
looks for.

 

Albany State's Werner Kolln and Don loss get their leg movements

synchronized in ﬁghting for a rebound against lthaca.
