purpose and highlights was distributed.
The Co-Chairmen, Dave Selismann and
Nancy Zollers, worked closely with stu-
dents from State and area colleges, the
Campus Center staff, and the National
Society for Autistic Children.

Puzzling, disruptive, heartbreaking.
Those are three terms which describe the
malady known as infantile autism. The
average individqu probably knows little of
this condition, or of how seriously it
affects a child and those around him.

Autistic children are usually born to
highly intelligent parents. In fact, the
children themselves often show flashes of
high intelligence and special abilities. The
tragic thing is that although they look like
normal children, often they exhibit bi-
zarre, disturbing behavior: grimaces,ges-
lures, spinning and twirling motions, flap.
ping of the arms, and temper tantrums.
They appear to be in a world of their own,
isolated and uncommunicativc.

The major problem shared by autistic
children is inadequate language develop-
ment. Those showing retarded speech de-
velopment are often mistakenly diagnosed
as mentally retarded. Autistic children
who do spciik cvidcncc ccholaliii, in which
phriiscs and words are rcpcntcd without
any inczining to thc child. l’ronoun reversal
is also common.

h’lcnnwhilc, \vhilc rcsciirch is being con-
ductcd, othcr things urc happening. it has
hccn found thiit autistic children can oflcn
bcncl‘it from special cducntion. The “talk-
