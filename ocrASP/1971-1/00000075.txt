Legalization of ‘Pot’

. “We can't wait to complete tests

arrests increase”. If this philo-
sophy holds, New York State may
be the ﬁrst state to have the use
of marijuana legalized.

A bill has been proposed to this
effect by Assemblyman Franz
Lelchter of the 69th District,
Manhattan. Leichter spoke to a
group of approximately 100 stu-
dents about this bill and the State
legislature Tuesday night.

Leichter’s bill would establish a
. Marijuana Control Commission
j which will make tests to deter-
mine the proper amount and
strength of marijuana that could
be in a “cigarette”. Marijuana
according to Leichter's intent
would also be taxed and sold only
to people over 18 in liquor stores.
He gives his bill little chance of
passing for at least 5 years, al-
though he believes that the penal-
ties for possession and sale will be

reduced very soon. He emphasized
that students should write and
talk to their legislators about this
and any other bill that they sup-
port or any issue that they are
concerned about.

If passed this bill may have
problems with the federal govern-
ment but Leichter feels that the
rest .of the country may soon
follow suit.

Although Leiehter has never had
any experience with marijuana, he
believes that the effects it has are
very similar to those of alcohol.

He said that he would never
support legalizing hard drugs such
as heroin or LSD, but he believes
that legalizing marijuana will re-
move the "subculture" surround-
ing it.

Leichter feels that legalization
would tend to decrease crime by
eliminating smuggling and related
crimes. Minimum government reg-
ulation would probably lcsscn
“Black Market" transactions.

Group Wants G.E. to

Alter Contract Choices

by Bob Baldassano

For a small coterie of Capital Area residents, the
peace movement has not collapsed. A group of
concerned students, housewives, teachers, workers,
and others have formed the “G.E. Production for
Peace Project." The purpose of this organization is
to convince the General Electric plant, located in
Schenectady to convert its war research into
research on amelioration of world poverty.

General Electric has the second largest defense
contract in the country—as of 1969 it was $1.6
billion. The research carried out in Schenectady has
been responsible for such modern “gadgetry” as the
“people sniffer” used against the general population
of Southeast Asia. It has also performed the
research and development on airborne personnel
detectors used in conjunction with the GE. minigun
made in West Lynn. In addition, the GE. plant
mach generators for Firebec Drone planes used for
hostile territory reconnaisancc territory and weap-
ons evaluation. And the list goes on still.

The GE. Production for Peace Project has issued a
statement of purpose in which they proclaim a
two-fold goal: 1. “To awaken the conscience of
GE. decision-mIIkers—make them sensitive to the
Company's obligations to the survival and well-being
of humanity, to American society, especially poor
minorities, and to the Company’s own employees.
Policies pointed only toward profits are destructive
of these higher values. 2. Accordingly, to get G.E.
entirely out of war production and into peace
production, especially for the alleviation of poverty
locally, in the nation, and in the world."

During the early part of January. the group
drafted ll letter to Fred J. Borsch, President of G.E.
asking him to consider a reorganization of priorities
from defense oriented research toward peace di'
rccted research. His senior vice-president, Robert
Estes responded that as corporate existence is a
privilege extended by the Government. G.E. owed
certain responsibilities to that Government. He
termed them “reciprocal responsibilities.“ In
addition he maintained that the renunciation of
defense spending is imprudent as long as human
hostility exists.

The Capital Area group intends to bring this effort
into national limelight by cooperating with its sister
groups in Philadelphia and Lynn.

 

Assemblyman Laichter has proposed legislation that, it posted, will
legalize the use of marijuana. (See story on page 2).

Controversy Arises Downtown

RA Not Rehired for Next Year

by Roy Lewis
Associate News Editor

Within the last few months, the
resident assistant system has been
the subject of increasing contro—
versy here at SUNYA. One area of
recent dissension concerns the re-
jection of present RA's to con-
tinue in their capacities next year.
A case of this nature has arisen in
Waterbury Hall.

Marjorie Keough,. an RA in
Waterbury, and Karlccn Karlson,
Waterbury's director of residenCe,
have II professional disagreement
as to the exact nature of an RA
position. It is Karlson's opinion
that an effectiVe RA shows
neither too little nor too much
interest in his/her section. She
also believes that RA's must grow
and expand as individuals in their
jobs. 'l‘hesc principles, as Karlson
explained, are applied to all re-
applying RA's. While II great deal
of confidentiality is involvcd in
each of these cases. it is known
that one of Karlson's objection

to Keough‘s performance this year
has been her very close ties to the
girls in her section. Karlson did
admit that Keough has been a
good RA this year.

When questioned, Keough told
this reporter that while she com-
prehends why she hasn't been
rehired, she feels that she has been
II good RA and should be rehircd.
in response to Karlson's concept
of individual growth within the
job, Keough stated that a person
will grow with every new exper-
ience he's faced with. as a matter
of natural development. Keough,
however, once again emphasized
the purely professional nature of
the dispute. While she may per-

sonally disagree with the decision,
she feels that she cannot ﬁght for
herself, as this would jeopardize
rapport among the staff.

Many of the girls in Keough's
section have already taken the
iniative to protest this decision. A
petition has been circulated in her
behalf and will be given to Charles
Fisher, Director of Housing, some-
time in the near future. Keough
supports their efforts, not only
for personal reasons, but also for
the fact that students have the
right to speak out since a good
RA is of vital concern to all
students.
