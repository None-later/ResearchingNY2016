The Movement Dies

To the Editor:

Two weeks ago US. intchention into Laos was reported.
Something had to he done! We were not going to wait around for
the pleasant spring weather to start the protest. We had to begin
now. We were out to prove to America that the movement was not
dead, as many people had begun to believe, but was very alive and
thriving.

At a Tuesday night meeting in a very crowded Fireside Lounge
planning began. Ideas were tossed back and forth for about three
hours. A rally at the campus center and a demonstration in the
capital building were planned as just the beginning of continuous
action. The moVement was moving again.

I went to the Wednesday rally at the (LC. and then drove witli a
couple of friends to the capital building. This being my first college
demonstration I was filled with anticipation and excitement.
However, when l arriVed. l was very disappointed. Standing ill the
lobby of the capital were no more than 75 noisy, disorganized.
paranoid (“No pictures. Don't talk to reporters, Don‘t sit down")
radicals. Somewhere in the middle of a lot of suggestions on what to
do next. I heard someone say something to the effect of “Well,
we've proven that the inow-meiil is still alive." And I thought to
myself “Wl'.. an ass!" We had just shown beyond any shadow of a
doubt that the movement was dying Very rapidly. The
demonstration was pitiful.

Now, two weeks later, the US. is still Very active in Laos (as in
most of South East Asia). but the campus is quiet. Why'.’ Could it he
that main people are beginning to lielieVe that mass action is not the
answer? l\l:i\ he they are beginning to believe tlial Voltaire was right
when he told people (in ('lllltfllll‘l that: “We should cultivate out
town) gardens. "

Be all you can be- Read!

Dear ASP,

Does anybody think that sex is important? The library doesn't.
The pathetically small section of sex-related books doesn't contain a
single volume on sexual technique!

It's time the library got on the ball. Modern. aware students l‘l‘llIlZl'
that although sex is more than a jumble of exotic postures, it simply
doesn't come iii-'uriilly. There‘s a lot that needs to be known before
we can successially culminate our affection and desire. especially
when complicated by condoms, etc.

Let‘s try and push the library over the hump of puritaiiisni aiio get
at least a dozen good books. (manuals, charts, films?)

Yours in the interest of a happier
healthier

sexier campus.

Why This “Lady” Is

A Tramp

 

 

by Robert Vcriiii

It all looks very tempting: a
musical score of which half the
songs have become standards;
lovely Audrey; Sexy chy; and
the overall aura of glamor and
entertainment so often associated
with the musical film. Be fore
warned, howuver: it's all a sham.
Audrey's singing voice is dubbed.
the decor seems to scream
“fiikel”. and the whole three
hour-plus extravaganza is a bloody
bore.

EVeryone connected with the
making of MY FAIR LADY (new-
ly reissued and playing at the
Madison ’l‘heater) seems to he
afflicted with the famous Holly-
weed cowardice which rilns along
the lilies of “don't tamper with
success," Recognizing the imr
mense popularity of the Lerner
and Loewe Broadway play. the
Warner Brothers genius ap-
proached the project of turning it
into ll film through what in effect
amounted to not taking it offthc
stage at all. Watch carefully: a
boom mike somehow manages to
sneak its way into the top of a
frame or two of the ConVeni (lar-
den sequence, reminding us that
it‘s not simply poor art. direction
that makes the scene look like a
tacky stage set. This film is a stage
play; and while it‘s Well iiiin
impossible for iiiosl films to dis
guise it, it makes no sense to
flaunt it.

This motion picture is of the
type that violates none of the tired
old Hollywood coichntions and
wins all kinds of (lseius in the
process. This kind of thinking is
best supported by the fact that

to give it an "outdoor" quality

ty, accomplished performance of
Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins for
posterity. 0ch pro Rex is a joy to
watch, although after performing
the role hundreds of times even he
shows occasional signs of bore-

Miles Freedom Express team with
an ex-Amboy Dukes vocalist to
produce a godawful racket. They
play as loudly as (if not louder
than) Grand Funk (too loud for
the human ear), toss their hair just
like GF, leap about in the same
stagy, artificial ecstacy. numb the
mind with boring, mindless ‘solos‘
devoid of content or musician—
ship. nnd really Work up a sweat
in their mindless attempt to 'get it

on'. The audience loved them.
The Byrds: Down came the

monster systems Cactus used and
up went some compact. neatly
shining amps and speakers. The
equipment, which was set up
within 10 minutes (that must be
the all time record), would have
looked more at home at a folk
concert. Down came the platform
bethen orchestra pit and stage.
and on came the Byrds. 3 cm. in
the morning and, ﬁnally, music!
They opened with an acoustic
number. Clarence White singing in
his mournful country way. Nice.

And then. Byrdsrock. My Back
Pages. Lover of the Bayou, an
awesomely powerful song—
McGuimi. a rock and roll angel in
a black preacher's suit. Clarence
White—clad and blue-caped un-
leashing their electric guitars. flex-
ing their musical muscles. Every
note clearly heardttheir sound
system, so small in appearance is a
gem). every word easily under-
stood.

Roger's voice has roughened just
the slightest from his choir-boy
days, just enough to giVe it the
bite and power he needs.

The country excursion mcl»
lowed and rounded the Byrds
without detracting from their po-
wer; they may play softly and
gently. but they can still unleash
that flood of pchr and rush of
blood that is what rock and roll is
basically about.

More acoustic music; Mr. ’I‘uiir
hourinc Illa”. the stanzas they

Finale at the Palace

didn't use on their smash single of
so long ago. Electric Tambourine
Man; by whipsawing from acous-
tic to electric numbers they give
you that surge of power in your
head without blasting your ears.
The double-lead of McGuinn and
White is the core of that electric
power; Clarence keeps sounding
like he’s playing pedal steel every
now and then but he isn’t— he
and drummer Gene Parsons inven-
ted a gadget he uses on his guitar
to obtain the effect; it enables
him to switch to and from the
whining pedal sound at the flick
of a wrist, while Roger's electric
12-string thunders as beautifully
as ever. Midway through, Roger
gets a sign from side-stage —he
proceeds to pass over a number he
was introducing. You know this is
going to be too short.

Take a Whiff, LeadbEIly's Co-
cain Blues. As Roger says. Spiro
Agnew would love this. From
cocaine to Jesus is Just Allright.
They try to get the audience to
clap a beat. It won't; the audience
is dead. Having gladly submitted
to rape by Cactus the beast lies
back, prostrate, organs too rough-
ly misused to respond.

All too soon comes the monster
jam—Eight Miles High. They try,
oh, how they try. to take the
audience there, but the beast lies
slouched on the floor, unheeding.
uncaring. Bassist Skip Battin and
drummer Gene Parsons do mar-
velously subtle things while Clar-
enca and Roger lay out; when
Clarence returns he does all kinds
of jazzy, improvisatory things
with his steel pedal-tone. The
beast sleeps on. One stanza of the
anthem. the band closes, and
McGuinn departs with a “We're
tired, you‘re tired, goodnite."
“God bless y‘ou.“ A bare forty
minutes. but you can‘t blame the
Byrds. Give them credit for stick-
ing around that long,
