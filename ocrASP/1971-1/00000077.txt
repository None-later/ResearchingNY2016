look toward post-season tourneys

 

Matmen Win Again, 25-6;
Finish Season, 9-2

by Lawrence H. Pohl

“They’re the best bunch of guys
We ever had the pleasure to
coach." A common sports cliche?
Possibly, but never has one clichc
better explained how Couch Joe
Garcia feels about his wrestlers.

The Albrrny Grapplers swept to
their 9th straight victory Tuesday
night by defeating Onconta, 25-6,
ending a record breaking season at
9-2.

The Danes were, led again by
undefeated Tom Hall. and also by
Phil Mims, Tim Coons, and Jim

Nightingale. Garcia noted that
Nightingale wrestled his best Tucs-
day against Oneontn. “He could
have beaten anyone in the confer-
cncc."

When asked why the team had
such a fine year. Coach Garcia
cited that “the four key words I
based our training on were: atti-
tude, pride, discipline and sacri-
ficc, and our boys lived up to
these to the fullest."

Garcia noted that wrestling in
thi.I years to come here at Albany
State should be vcry successful.

“We'rc losing si-nior Tim Coons.
brrt wr- hrch lhv rust of the sound

returning and there are a number
of good prospects on the cam-
pus.“ stated the coach.

“If we keep up our spirit and
effort then I see some very suc-
ccssful years ahead."

As far as post season play is
concerned, the NY State Invita-
tional Tournament. in which the
whole team will participate, will
be held March 5-6, at. RIT. The
NCAA Small College Tournament
will be held March 12th and 13th
in Fargo, North Dakota. Garcia
will be taking Nightingale, Al-
brecht. Minis, and Coons to the
loul'tit‘y.

Zeke Speaks

 

by Bob Zaremba

 

 

Wednesday nidtt's game was a little sloppy, but it's a win. And by a pretty
healthy margin too. We're the hottest team in the state right now, there's not
much doubt about that. You can't really be much hotter.

About that stall. It's simply a matter of trying to get an opponent to play the
defense you want them to play. Utica was In a zone, and Doc can choose to
either work against the zone or try to get them out of it.

"We play better against a man-to-man",explains the coach. "We're not big and
we'll get shots closer to the basket against a man to man."

it's a good strategy and has helped us win several games this year. St. Francis,
Siena, Hartwick, New Paltz. They all tried using zones against us but once we
had gotten a small lead against the lone, we held it out against them, and forced
them into a man to men.

The question arises, though, was Wednesday mm"
the time to do it? Utica Is no powerhouse and they
know this. They probably figured themselves to be at
least 20 point underdogs. So they were pretty
content to let Masterson and Ouattrocchi play
bouncy ball for four minutes. It kept them only a
few points behind and within striking range. Besides .
I should think that we would want to win big over a
team like Utica, as there are some pretty important
people who are watching as rather closely.

Doc did have some second thoughts about the
move the following day.

"It wasn't a very good team to do it against. They have weak bench, and it
let them keep their starters in the game and out of foul trouble. If I hadn't
done it, we'd have had a better halftime lead."

Consider yourself forgiven.

SAUEFIS

 

Wednesday the Selection Committee picked two teams for the NCAA
Tournament, Buffalo State and C.W. Post. That leaves two spots, but one bid
traditionally goes to the best team in New Jersey, and that looks to be an old
friend, Montclair St. [What can ya' say, what can ya‘ do?).

The spot that remains is of course the one we're fighting for. So is Hartwick,
Brockport, and Union. Marist has lost six and they have stated preference for
the NAIA Tournament anyway, so they're no longer under consideration.

Hartwick lost Wednesday to King's College. That gives them live losses and
also, chalking up the fact that we beat them ourselves, should give us some kind
of edge there.

Brockport has only lost three games but one of them was to Hartwick. They
face SUNY Buffalo tonight at Buffalo. Should they drop that one, it'll make
two opponents they'll have lost to that we've beaten.

Which brings us to the team many observers feel has the inside track, Union
College, who finished their season Wednesday with a close victory against
Hamilton College.Hamilton was 0-14 going into the game, and therein lies the
catch. Union must have a pretty good team but it's hard to say iust how good
they really are. Their 18-3 record comes against quite the rinky dink schedule.
When Union fans yell, "Beat Saint Rose," they really mean it. We’ve done much
better than they against our common opponents, but alas, they did defeat us
early in the season in the Christmas Tournament. That was December, however,
and two and a half months can change a team around quite a bit. The Selection
Committee is supposed to judge a team’s [ill'wtil ability, but nevertheless, that
loss to Union has to loom as an enormous factor.

But Is it enormous enough to keep us out of the tournament? Sauers doesn't
think so. "I think that the team deserves a bid. We deserve it on the strength of
our record and our schedule."

Amen. But it's the other Doc who's on the Selection Committee.

They confer again next Wednesday at high noon.
