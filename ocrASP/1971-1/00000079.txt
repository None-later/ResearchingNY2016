Don’t let success get you down.

Once there was an upwardly mobile man whom I will call Case-
ment R. Glehe (not his real name). Even as an undergraduate Mr.
Glebe didn't. Tumble and dither and grope for the meaning of life like
some lazy long-haired slohs I could name. He knew exactly what life
was about. Life was working hard so you could get good grades and
graduate with honors and lind a swell job and get married and move
to Westport and have three children like every other decent American.

And that's precisely what Mr. (ilcbe did. He graduated magna,
got it swell job in the advertising game, married a girl, whom I will
call Mavis Davis (her real name), who was not only service-oriented
and achievement-prone but. also had a real nice liiiild, and they bought
a lovely home in Westport with electric baseboard heating and wilhin
three years they had three line sturily little boys rl“lopsy, Mopsy aiul

To his sons, Mr. Globe was a loving but stern lather. llc raile
them to believe in his own guiding values 7 ambition, sell-denial and
hard work-«and the boys responded brilliantly. l"|opsv, the oldest,
ﬁnished high school as valedictoriaii and was :o-ceptcd. by Harvard.
Mr. Globe was, of course, very proud and happy. The following year
Mopsy was also \‘illt’lllt'ltil’lilll and was also accepted by Harvard.
Again Mr. Glt-bc was proud but, to be perfectly honest, iiol quite so
happy, for now he had two sons in Harvard at the same time, \\'lllt‘ll

by Jeffrey P. Bernstein

In a determined effort to
make certain that the student
populace is presented with the
best possible document for its
approval, Cotiiicil membor Jeff
Wassermaii presented another
viable Student Association Con-
situlinn as Central Council con-
tinued to focus its attention upon
revision.

Carlson Case

May R eopen
by Bob Kanarek

Students trying to reopen the
case of Helen Carlson's tenure on
the department level haer run into
a serious problem. They still liaVe
not been able to obtain the rea-
sons why she was not recom-
mended for tenure. They have,
however,sought to compile
evidenCe as to Carlson's teaching
abilities, as the tenure committee
had very little indication of her
classroom skills.

One tenured member of the
English Department considered
Carlson an “avornge or mediocre
teacher." However, evaluation
sheets handed out in her classes
are overwhelmingly favorable.
They include such comments as:
“I find this class much better than
the average English class," “She
really brings poi-try alive," and “if

stills of the surVeys conducted and
the petitions will, lliei'cl'ore, be
used in an attempt to achieve this
goal.

trodiices plans for the creation of
a Finance Cobncil. This Council
would have the power to allocate
funds, determine general finance
policy, and have ultimate control
of student finances. Such power is
now vested in Central Council.
Under the new proposal Cen-
tral Council “shall be empowered
to provide effective communica-
tion for relating students of the
University with every part. of the
University community and with
the broader community as well."
No faculty members would belong
to either of the councils as all
decisions made by these legislative
bodies would affect only students.
Council will meet an hour and
a ball" earlier than usual this
’l‘litirsday to allow ample time for
thorough examination into the
latest constitutionalallcrnatiVe.

Other Business

Central Council over-
whelmingly approved a bill con-
dcmniiig the Kremlin “in their
treatment of the Jews in the
Soviet Union, especially in their
unwillingness to allow emigration
of Jews from the Soviet Union.“

in a 20-0-2 vote, Cotiiicil stip-
ported the idea of a teacb~in this
semester in an effort to educate
the University and Capital area
communities as to the severity of
the problem. The various public
legislative bodies were urged to
join in this condemnation of the
Kremlin. Copies ol~ the bill will be
sent to Brezhnev, Kusygin, Rocke-
l'eller, and Nixon.

Regents Approves
Doctor of Arts

The State Board of Regents ap-
proved guidellnes for a new Dot--
tor of Arts degree that will be
teacher-oriented, rather tlinn ro-
searcli-orienlod, as is the PhD.

The l).A. degree will be awarded
(in an experimental basis for a
seven-year period, beginning next
September, by institutions ol‘ uni-
versily i'aiilt that already offer
other doctoral programs.

The innovative program, aimed
at. improving the qualin oi' iciieli-
iiig, could be completed in llll't‘t'
yet s of full-time grataliite study.
The re‘ults ol' the experiment will
be assessed in 1978 to determine
whether the DA. should become
a permanent degree.

Miehael Harrington spoke here Thursday on "Why We Need Socialism in America." ---aluerson

Harrington’s Socialism:

‘Corresponds to American Needs’

by Kenneth Deane

“Socialism corresponds to deep needs in American society...u
society which demands radical structural changes." This statement
represents the essence of Michael Harrington’s vibrant appeal for the
creation of a socialist state iii America.

Harrington, who spoke here last Thursday evening on “Why We
Need Socialism in America," is the national chairman of the Socialist
Party and author of several probing books on the economic and
political state of the nation.

l'liirringmn's compelling, though radical argument rests upon two
major premises. First, a political state based upon private enterprise
cannot. possibly provide for the soc l needs of the many. The reason,
according to Harrington, is that private invostment. in public projects,
such as low income housing, 2; simply not profitable, ll the state is to
meet its social needs it will have to finance these projects itsell'.

Secondly, due to the nature of a capitalist society “it cannot
handle its technology." llarriiigtoo stated that our enormous tech-
nological strides place an important social responsibility upon private
enterprise, one which it is not willing to assume. Only if industry is
policed by the public can it be made responsible to it and only then
can the benel'ils of technology be employed to serve society at large,
claimed Harrington.

A Socialist stale, Harrington iiiiiintaiiied would i'e-struclurt- the
eiiliri- society. “A (leiiiiicralimlitiii ol' ownership of large corpora-
lions" would be lilitill‘ltlt'nlt'tl. This would constitute llll‘ direct
election (ll. all corporate executives, in order to make them responsible
lo the people. The value system of society would also how to be
adjusted. llarruigtoii continued, concomitant with a reallocation of
incomes. No longer would there be the very Wealthy and the very
lltlhr,

'l'lioiigli Socialism does "provide answers to some political, social
and economic problems, it is iiol a panacea," Harrington adriiitted.
lt‘or Socialism to be successful it must be based upon “abundance and

 

 

dciiioei‘ ,

In response to sevoral questions as to the theoretical basis ol’ his
Socialism, Harrington slated l.llill lll‘ rejected the inevitability of
( warfare and believed that only throngli the democratic process
could Socialism l)l' achieved in the United States.
