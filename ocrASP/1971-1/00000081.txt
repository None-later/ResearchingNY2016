Pure Joy In A Celebration Of Life

by. Bob Ksnsrok

This weekend, Music Council
sponsored Celebration. a musical
play by Tom Jones and Harvey
Schmidt. The play was a celebra-
tion of life, characterized by four
basic philosophies, submission to
society (Angel), conquering socie-
ty (Rich), idealism towards socie-
ty (Orphan) and survival in socie-
ty (Potemkin). Each character
wanted the qualities of another,
love becomes the most common
denominator, boy gets girl and
everyone celebrates.

Kay Ten Kraft as Angel was
unconvincing at the beginning of
the play, yet her performance was
much improved in the second act.
John Kearns was very good as the
youthful, idealistic, yet horny Or-
phan. How typical of the SUNYA
freshmen! His “Eye of God.” and
song. "My Garden." were very
funny. Bob Herbert as Mr. Rich
had the audience roaring. His lines
were funny, and his mannerisms

The Isaac Hayes Movement

by Stephen Aminotf

As I wander through the
names of major influences on the
contemporary rock scene, we note
a certain sparcity of late as far as
new, fresh, innovative talent is
concerned. But on rare moments,
if we listen closely enough, we can
hear of new people who are alive
and inspiring, though somewhat
overlooked. Dig Isaac Hayes.

Isaac Hayes is a massiveibeau-
tiful looking man, whose Very
appearance is enough to captivate
a situation. His talents as a pro-
ducer, arranger and composer have
gone very much unnoticed by
those who comprise the while
music scene. Believe it when I say
that the man has the power to
dominate your musical senses
with his brand of heavily orche-
strated urban snul.

My first encounter with Mr.
Hayes took place at the Fillmore
where he shared a bill with Richie
Havens and Nina Simone. As the
first act on the show, he faced a
definite disadvantage playing to
an anxious, not as yet filled Fill-
more crowd. The music was good,
and yet Isaac Hayes was not get-
ting it on the way he should,,llis
whole orchestra; complete with
violin section and three gorgeous
sisters named Hot, Buttered rrnd
Soul; played to a really unreccp-
tive Fillmore audience,

What was to be heard in their

all too short set was the sort of
pulsating excitement we come to
know Isaac by. He might feel
warm and decide to take the
mood down u little with one of
his soft raps. The orchestration
was fine, but after a while you
realiZe that it's the man's person<
ality that's forging the sound.

Hayes is no stranger to music.
For a long time. his work with
Sam and DIIVL‘ put him in high
standing with thr- patrons of At‘
lantic Soul. lle collaborated with
Dave Porter to write “Sotil Man"
and “Hold Oh. I'm Comin."

Anyway, there are these four
albums which can Ir-aVc you with
some hours of fierce listening if
you let them, His first one, “Pru-
sr-nting Isaac Hayes," is probably
best described as a prelude for
things to come. “Hot Buttered
Soul" gave people a taste of where
the man's genius could be taken
to. Ilis renditions of “Walk On
By" and “By the Time I (let in
Phoenix" are easily llll' most irnzr
ginativc variations on those starr-
dards I've ever heard.

"The Isaac Hayes Movr'nicul”
brought some talented
violin in the picture. The intr-r~
weave between the violin and
Hayes' own moving piano took
Lennon-McCartney's “Sonic-
thing" and made it come alivr-. i
mean you could li-cIsomr-lhing III
the way she moVed when those
guys were doin‘ it.

So now We havrr his new”...'l‘o
Be Continued," and it perfectly
attests to the fact that not all

clr-ct ric

artists bavu to let their old themes
just recur in their subsequent
work. Isaac Hayes' music is grow-
ing, as it. becomes more and more
rcflectch of the man behind it,
After letting "The Look of Love"
float in your mind for a while,
you flip the record to hear a
medley of something called “Ike's
Mood" and “You've Lost ’l‘hat
Loving Feeling," The results are
better hoard than described. So
don't be afraid to let some cat
turn you on to Isaac Hayes, it
might make you want to listen for
a while.

and acting used them to their
optimum hilarity. Hiﬁ‘p‘erform-
snce was so consistent me an air
of comedy seemed to accompany
his entrances on stage.

The fourteen Revelers Were ex-
cellent. Their singing was so
spirited that "Celebration" be-
came more than an obscure title.
Their dancing was very well timed
and their antics, such as the "Ex-
terior Decorators," were nothing
less than sidesplitting. The Third
String Choir Boys were a riot.
Their stumbling slapstick was ex-
ecuted with perfection.

        

PENDULUM/CREEDENCE
CLEARWA'I‘ER REVIVAL
(FANTASY 8410)

If the rumors are true and
CREEDENCE is indeed splitting,
it would be quite a shame for at
last the group is starting to invosti-
gate new realms of music. Their
latest (and perhaps last) album
“Pendulum” is their most ventur-
ous to date,

CREEDENCE always had a
tendency to be redundant and I
never really could listen to any of
their albums in one sitting. There
are only a couple of standout cuts
here but the listening is pleasur-
able enough throughout.

Much more emphasis has been
placed on the rhythm section than
ever before although John
Fogcrty is still the dominating
force. Stu Cook‘s bass seems to
be rejuvenated and even Doug
Clifford experiments a little on
drums. Il'ogcrty has switched to
keyboards so brother ’I‘om gets a
chance to provc himself at lead

Long

alities became as intertwined in
“real life" as they appeared to be
on that stage, it will take them
weeks to regain their own identi-
ties.

I saw the original production of
this play back in lil67 with Brian
Murray and dot... Wood in the
roles. With all due respect to
messicurs Murray and Wood, l
have now seen better.

Jeffrey Scott ’I‘inklcman was the
perfect Rosencrantz, the baby«
faced man-child who manages to
blunder his way through the ac-
tion, always a step behind and a
half-step ahead of everyone else~
the ideal foil for Guildenstern,
the thinker, the seeker of the
reason behind the actions which

ROCK PILE

b Eric Graeber

 

The character of Potemkin was
played by Michael Reynolds. His
performance was, as usual. excel-
lent. His singing, acting and
dancing added to a very memor-
able performance. As director,
choreographer and actor, with
two and a half weeks of rehearsal
time, Mr. Reynolds has achieved
his most notable accomplishment
to date. The show was a great
success and I extend my personal
“thanks” to Michael Reynolds, his
entire cast and crew for a most
enjoyable performance and a job
well done.

“Hey
Tonight;H is that he will not give
his brother an inferiority coin-
plex.

The two best cuts on the
album are the heaviest ones:
“Born To Move“ and “Pagan
Baby." The former includes the
kind of precise, exact notes that I
am so fond of. John Fogerty‘s
organ solo is simple but elastic.

There are some songs that
could easily be labeled as commer-
cial. notably "Molina," "Have
Your Ever Seen The Rain," and
“Hey Tonight." However, it is
singles like these that keeps AM.

In "Rude Awakening No. 2"
CREEDENCE is either trying to
create a musical experience for
stoned heads or satirizing groups
who do the same. At any rate, the
song does not come off, mainly
because it sounds so contrived.

Il' CRIEEDENCE splits, this
album will be a big tease, because
we will never know how good

His height added to the domin-

emanating from him. It was with
ga‘cat difficulty that. the principals
kept him from stealing almost
every scene he appeared in. His
facial expressions alone were
worth the bother of standing in
line or sitting on the floor during
the performance.

Telethon ’71

Telethon '7l was a smashing success! The filial total of contribu—
tions for the 2st hour program was about $7,500.00

Most notable of the many fine acts were the Burundi Dancers and
Drummers, “Little Nell,“ the Excells, Horton Strong, ’I‘ottie Rhodes
and the Mister and Mistress Game. An encouraging factor was the
series of speeches by such celebrities as President Benezet and Mayor
Corning, interspersed throughout the program. However, the best times
were had during the auctions, where bodies and pics for tossing at
faces were sold. Most memorable were the stiles of MHZ Zahurak who
went for $60 and Cy Barker the most valuable of all, at $200.

Sean Casey of WABY, and WSUA radio stations provided an
enthusiastic 24 hour coverage of the Telethon, and W’I‘EN and WRGB
televised portions of the show.

Most important of all, was the audience. Many students stayed for
all 2-l hours, giving their suport to the ’i‘r-lcthon, their applause and
appreciation to the performers and their money to the Society for
Autistic Children. Over :Illt) workr-rs, and 200 pcrl'rn'mr-rs participated
in llll‘ 'I‘clclhon, and tears were flowing then the $7,000 mark was
broken.

'l‘r-art'ul, tired, but very happy, ctr-chairmen, Dave aml Nancy
thanked all of the workers, performers, and audience for their
support. They only forgot to thank lllt'ms‘l'lvt‘s, two people who did
more than others to make 'I'r-lcthon '7l llll‘ best 'l‘clcthon that
SUNYA has chr had. 'l‘hanks!

Chucks may be made out to 'l‘r'lt-thon '7] and contributions maybe
mailed to Telethon '71, Box :lll-Ilil‘l, l~i(J0 Washington Ave, Albany,
