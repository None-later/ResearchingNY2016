The Evolution Of Cinema

 

 

by Tom Quigley

Mark Twain once remarked, af-
ter having had a run in with a
particularly obnoxious honey-
moon couple on one of his occan
voyages, that he could not find it
in his heart to remain angry for
very long with a vacuum. This is
precisely the altitude ii vicwcr
should trike toward a ludicrous
little nothing cntitlchOOLSthrIt
stars two attractch performers,
ic Jason Rohards and Katherine
Ross.

Last ycar gave us a banal “now”
love story callcd JOHN AND
MARY that. slarrcd Dustin Iloff-
man and Mia Farrow. The only
notablc thing about that film was
the interior decoration of Mr,
Hoffman‘s garrct. This year's suc-
ccssor, FOOLS, follows the hol-
low footsteps of the former at‘
tempting to accomplish the same
cnds using essentially the same
means.

I‘he new formula consists of
spic‘ing tip the old love story gi-nrr-
with a dash of pscudo-polilIcal
romantic rclcvaricy, flcshcd out
with tokcn nudity and eccentric
supporting characters (such as
hyperbolic hippies and fanatic.
foaming- at~tlicanouth right wing
crs'). Finally, two popular lcarling
stars arc allowed to wander
around the emptiness in search of
life's meaning, love, and it plot.

The sub-human mentality of
tinscl-town mogucls has not yct
learned that you cannot expect
performers, no matter how talcnt-
cd, to work miracles with a pur-
poscless plot and embarrassing di-
uloguc. In this respect, FOOLS
must be credited with being the
most consistent, singlc~mindcd
nothing so far this year. I

Jason Robards plays an aging,
washed-up ghoul from old horror
flicks who is currently unem-
ployed and starving for affection.
He runs into a dissolute off-spring
of the PcpsiACokc gent-ration,
Kathcrinc Ross, who has been
emotionally bruiscd by that prr-~
(Iictahlc marriage-that-went-

wrong. Together, they romp
through hiuarc, i-rotic San
Francisco, land of chuurinistrc

cops, insensitivr- automation. and
rampant fornication.

Rubards, an old hand at playing

 

sour, middle aged bachelors, gives
iron blood performance as the
second rate actor. Indeed, he is so
lifeless that nothing he does
throughout the entire film could
convtncc us that all he needs to
cure his troubles is a shot of
Gcritol or Pi-pto-Bizmo, Katherine
Ross is so remarkably beautiful
that you almost forgct she is
sir-adin gaining in maturity as air
actress. She is the only consula-
tiori in this entire vacancy. Scott
Ilylaiids. as the \Vcalthy, ox»
husband has n Iltttliklt'ss I'oli- cul-
led from back Issues of Playboy.

’I‘clcvision director Tom Grit-s
(Rottlt‘ 00) uscd to know how to

The Me Nobody Knows

adequately handle actors in a
comedy-drama, but his talent has
gotten lost in his first feature
effort. His conception of ii scene
is limited to spaces so small that it.
looks as though he were directing
another television drama instead
of ii wide screen film. The climatic
scene is so totally unbelievable
that even its cumulative shock
effect is numbing instead of trag-
Ic.

Grics has thc presence of mind
to turn his cameras upon Miss
Ross or the beautiful location
scr-Iicry whcn lhr.I plot bccoincs
limp, which is often. Unfortunate-
ly, liowcvcr, FOOLS turns otit to
ha a prophctic titlc

We’ve Gotta Crow
About ‘Peter Pan’

by Bob Kattan

I’ctcr I’an is iilch and wcll and
flying high ovor the main stagiI in
Ilic Performing Arts Ccntr-r. The
musical, which opened here ch‘
Iicsday night and continues
through Sunday, had had phcno~
mcnal succc. , drawing almost
four full Iintlst's on two actual
performances (the other two were
a dress rchcarsal and a preview).
Patricia Snyder, director, has donc
an cxccllcnt job and has expressed
great optimism for the cast‘s po«
tr-nlial to make this one of tlic
outstanding performances ever in
bi- pri-scntcd on this campus.

For a tlicatrcical pcrfurmancr‘
requiring the utmost. in song,
dancc, acting, scenic design, light~
ing, costumes and countless other
features, Peter Pan lives up to that
standard in just about every area.
(Tlautlinc Cassan is simply brilliant
in her role as Peter Pan, displaying
l'lt‘r vivaciousncss and enthusiasm

 

for Peter with every move. Joel
Aroestc portrays Captain Hook as
everything he should bcv-bitter,
uncouth, villainous, yet with the
touch of liumur that sets the
audience roaring. The scenery is
magnificent, choreography specta~
cular, and of course the flying
scenes are sensational besides be-
ing unique to this type of produc-
tion.

For you poor souls who have no
tickets (and I imagine that‘s a
good number of you), all is not
lost. The pcrformanco will be tele-
vizud live ovor closed-circuit tele-
vision and will be shows in LC-4
tonight and Saturday night at.
8:00 p.m. absolutely free of
charge, Now that's a real bargain.
So then, how about seeing some
others get high this weekend? It's
all at LC-l tonight and tomorrow
night-DON‘T MISS THIS ONEI!

Iic sure in sec Hir' in-dcptlt
t‘t't'lt‘tt' in Monday 's ASI’.
