Danes Finish 17-5;
Bid Goes to Hartwick,

Alan Reid scored 22 points last
night as he as well as starters Jack
Jordan, Steve Sheehun, and Jim
Masterson played their last game
for Albany State, in what was
again as we have come to expect,
a victory for the Great Danes.

Jack Jordan scored his 1,000th
career point last night and became
only the sixth player in Albany
State history to do so. He wound
up his three year career with
1,011 points.

The final score was 73-65; half-
time 26-22, but that mattered
little last night. Everybody who
had religioust watched Stutt- play
this year somehow know they
were going to win. They saw the
team that won 17 of their 22
games outhustlo their opponent.
They saw one of the top 15

Zeke Speaks

"I thought Hartwick was out of it," reflected Doc Snuors yesterday, “they
lost two of their last tour games and so I loll that they had eliminated
themselves."

So did I.

So did Hartwick. In their own community relation lolousos, they made
comments to the alloct that their two losses to RIT and Kings ﬂoor the and at
the season probably would keep them out of the tournament.

Luckily Ior them they weren't on the Selection Committee. The live schools
represented on the Eastern Regional Selection Committee were the Athletic
Directors from LeMoyne, Hobart, Wagner, Albright, and Albany. The Chairman
vvu Wilbur Rankin ol Albright College, who moonlights as the Selection
Committee 0' the Middle Atlantic Conference, to which Albright College
belongs. And to which Rankin belongs, or should belong anyway. What in the
world some guy lrom Pennsylvania is doing as the chairmanlno less) of the
Eastern Regional Committee is as disturbing a question as is the question at
how the hell Hartwick got the bid in tho lirst place.

Rankin intormad Doc Werner Wednesday at the beginning oi the "phone
meeting" that he would have to remove himself from the meeting because his
school was under consideration. Rankin Is supposed to have a replacement
ready when doing such a thing. The replacement would have probably been
somebody from this area, lor they try to have the committee represent the
dillorant geographical sections of the Region.

It is not terribly absurd to think that a roprosontatlve Irorn this area could
have made a considerable difference, tor the Selection Committee dclibaratos as
I WW, and seeks a unanimous vote in their proceedings. Asked whothor a

..

their last 14 games, offensively
outplay their opponent. And they
saw the team that won its last IO
consecutive games nullhinh their
opponent.

The news had come out early in
the afternoon that Hurtwick Col-
lege (iii-5) had l‘oilcd State's
hopes For a bid to the NCAA
'I‘ouI‘namenl.. The news had spread
quickly through the school. A Full
four minute standing ovation ne—
vertheless greeted the Danes as
they stepped out onto the floor, II
tribute to a team that had main-
tained a winning tradition in what
perhaps may be correctly called
the SIIIIL-r spirit.

substitute committee member could have changed things, Werner
"it's possible." Rankin did apologize to Warner Ior his failure to appoint a
substitute.

Warner was inlormad ol the decision several hours later. "They gave me no
explanation," he said. "It’s just one of those disappointlng things."

Ha did, however, otter some explanation, possibly lromhis recollection ol the
previous week's meeting in Mtich he took part. It sooms thu Cummittee was
very impressed with the fact that two 0' Hartwick's losses camu at the hands of
University Division Teams, whereas our losses were to College Division Teams.
This is one side of the coin, and the more remote side. What about winning? No
mention is m ado at winning against a University Division Team. Is that not
bitter than losing against one? We laced two (St. Francis and Bullalol and beat
them both.

Our records were virtually identical. We play schedules at equal dilliculty.
There Is not one shred ol evidence to Iavor Hartwick over us (save that
nonsense above), and in our lavor we have a VIctory over thom In the regular
season. So what happened?

HOW'S a guess. The real decision ligurod to boil down In a hot battle between
Union and ourselves. This may have been the cnso, and tho battlu may have
been lust a hit too hot for tho Saloction CornInIttuo to handlo. It's not
altogether unimaginablo that Hnrtwick emurgod as a murmur; dark horso, and a
way to shrink lrom the heart ol the situation. Purliups urlnblo to loosen the
Slalomate between Albany and Union, tho UiISIOSI way out was to not gIvo It to
either at us.
