‘ Good Nucleus for Next Year ’ -Doc

by Robert Zarembs
Sports Editor

After the disappointment of not
getting an NCAA bid had mellow-
ed somewhat, Coach Richard
“Doc” Sauers was the ﬁrst to
point to the age old cliche.
“there‘s always next year."

And next year will be the seven-
teenth time Doc has faced a next
year. In the previous sixteen he
has never failed to come up with a
winner. and prospects for his new-
est challenge seem bright to him.

Admittedly he will be losing the
services of some excellent ball-
players. His graduating Co-Cap-

if talns, Alan Reid and Jack Jordan
are the ones he feels he will have
the most trouble replacing. Jordan
holds the number six spot on the
all time Albany State scoring list.

According to Coach Sauers. John Ouattrochi will have to lead the

speaks of Jack as “pound for
pound and inch for inch the best
rebounder l eVer had,...a real good
competitor.” 

Alan Reid was also tremendous-
ly valuable to the Danes in his two
year stint with them. His hands
were amazingly quick and amaz-
ingly accurate. “Al was without a
doubt". comments Doc.“the
quickest, fastest man I have ever
coached." He used his speed of
hand to lead the team in clean
steals and conversions. and also in
making a habit of staffing oppo-
nents who were going in all alone
on break-away layups. Offensive-
ly. his shooting between this year
and last rose almost 12% as he
finished the season roughly 47"!)
from the field.

Sauers felt that this year's team
was far superior to the one he
coached to an NCAA Tourney

berth two years ago. “We didn’t
have any one individual as good as
Margison (Rich) or Price (Scott),
but we were much quicker. han-
dled the ball much better. and had
a much stronger team defense."

Even with the loss of four start-
ers. Doc points to John Quat-
trochi. Dave Welchona, Werner
Kolln. and Don Joss as a good.
solid nucleus for a team next
season.

“Quattrochi will have to be our
leader next year. John's my kind
of ballplayer. There's no doubt
that he's capable of the job."

Quattroehi ended up the season

leading the team by far in causing
enemy turnovers. John puttogeth-
81‘ l06 steals. charging drawn. and
whatever else he could think of to
lead the team in that category.
Quattrochi was one of those who
was always in the right spot at the
right time. always scooping up the
loose ball.

Dave Welchons came very much
into his own toward the end of
the season. Doc refers to his 6'2”
guard as “the best passer on the
team". and indicates that a little
more confidence and experience
could make him really go places in
the next two years.

Women Demand

Health Care Reform

Minor disturbances at, the University Bookstore
and at the Infirmary marked the recognition of
International Women's Day at SUNYA. The cht.
sponsored by Women's Liberation. included work-
shops. movies and discussions emphasizing female
repression in various aspects of modern society.

Early in the day. about 15 members of Women's
Lib. in conjunction with their tcach»in activities.
staged a minor demonstration in the Bookstore.
'l‘lit-y entered the store and proeccdcd to gather
si-vcral magazines. particularly “Playboy.” and
threw them on the floor, According to several
members of Women's Lib, this was iiol a planned
course of action and did iiol ha~ ' thr- support of all
women.

Later in the day. approximately 20 mcmbcrs of
Women's Lil) incl at the Infirmary and pl‘csclllcrl
llll' director. Dr. Janet llood. a list of four demands.
The demonstrators distrilnllr'd a mimeographcd
sin-cl which callcd for thc following:

I l Frei- gylict‘olugit'til examinations for all women
in the University community including sludcnts.
slliff and facility. “A woman should be able to sec a
gynecologist, upon demand." llic statement read.
“and iiol have to depend upon another doctor‘s
rcconimcndalion as is now policy.”

2) lt‘rcc birth control and information must bc
mudc available to all women of tlic UiiiVi-rsily
commonity~~stndcnts. faculty and staff.

ii) l"rcc abortion counseling for all women of the
Unchrsily community upon request.

1) “These sci'vit‘cs." thr- slalcml-nl concluded.
“must be accorded to any woman over lit years of
agr- willionl tlic ncr-d of purcnls pcrinissioi or
knowledge. l)lll We strongly bclicvu that all wwuo-n
of any agc should b:ch lhc riglil to these to these
scrviccs but 18 years old is a stale slipulnlirir ." 'I‘Iii-
slalcnicnl rilischi-d lhal this “is another stipulation
of state control l)\'l'l' women‘s bodies which must bc
abolished.”

It should bc nolcd llial gynecological scrvicr-s arc
available only on Wednesdays nl lhc Infirmary

l)l‘. llood was couccrncd by the demonstrators
conduct which. in llt'l‘ opinion. slioWi-d lhcm to be
"not concci'ncd with serious discu ion and convcr-

   

saliun." "'l‘hci'c was an unwillingness to be serious
about lllt' issues." she said.

 

Hood t ed the l'urlhcr comment that the
dcnuinds reflected a lack of undc‘slanding on llll'
part of lhc demonstrators. “This isn't a uiiivr-rsily
health scl'ViL‘t‘." she said. apparently commenting on
the demands that. these services be made available to
the cnlirc community. rather than just students.

She said that the subjects presented to her had
always been of interest. and that she had been
working on these areas throughout her (‘lll‘l't'l'.
"There was an absolute and total unwillingness to
communicate." she said.

State University of New York at Albany

 

Approximately 20 women entered the bookstore Monday and removed magazines. notably Playboy

from the racks.

.Iancl Hood. hard of the infirinary. was present with a list of demands for better female health care.
especially in the area of birth control.

SUN Y- Wide Referendum
Seen For Mandatory Tax

Students at 27 State University campuses will be given the

xll‘ Iflllﬂ'lllltlll Writcr

chance to (lecide in special referendums this

spring whether student activity fees should be voluntary or mandatory. SUNY Chancellor Ernest L. Boyer

announced ’l‘uesdiiy.

'l‘he chancellor said a new policy concerning the fees would take effect next September,

“If the studch at a campus decide upon a voluntary activity fee. the students themselves‘ will be
responsible for the collection and disbursement of the funds." Boyer said.

“If. lioweVer. students favor a mandatory fee. then strict accountability to the state is required," he

added. “The collection. budgeting iind e

university ofﬁcials."

xpundinire of such fees must take place under the control of

. . . . .
lhc chancellor sannouncementdid not specify how the question would be worded for the referendums

 

Students at 27 State University campuses will cast ballots tlils spring to decide whether or not they want

mandatory or voluntary student lines.

'Uillt’l‘NUIl

or whether an ill)()SlUl-t' majority of the student body would be needed

to bring about a change from mandatory to voluntary fees.

Instead. Boycr indicated that "common mid detailed guidelines" for
the referendums would be submitted to the university's Board of
'l‘ruslees at the lriistccs' regular meeting later this month.

The voting will be conducted at. the 27 slate-operated campuses. The
fch contract colleges and Jill locally sponsored community colleges
arc not involved.

lloycr noch in his two page slatcincnt lbc rcconuiicndnlions made
last ycar by State Comptroller Arllnu' lil'Vlll and the court action that
rcsullcd from controversy ovr-r spending for student activity pro
grams.

l.cvill called for liglilcr controls on spciiding by student organi-
zations. If that Wits not done. he addcd. sIudi-nts should not hr-
rcquircd Io pay the fees.

Last September. a State Supreme ('ourl justice ruled in favor of two
Albany students who challr-ngcd expenditures Iicrc. saying some of
the funds wcrc uscd for quvslionnblc political purposes.

In October. the SUNY Iruslccs decided on an interim plan to
regulate the spending, That decision i'cqllii'cs campus presidents to
rcvu-w and certify appropriations to make sure they are of an
"educational. cultural. recreational or socuil nature."

lloyci' also created a special committee nuidc up of administrators.
faculty and students to come up with a long-range solution.

In his latest slalcmcnl. illl‘ chancellor said the plan for referendums
and for administrative supervision of funds produced by inundated
fccs reflects the sentiments of the majority of SUNY presidents and
student leaders.

"The new referendum procedure recognizes the continued import-
iincc of student activities and invole students actively in the basic
decision regarding the program." Boyer concluded
