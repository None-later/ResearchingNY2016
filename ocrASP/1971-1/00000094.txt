Let’s hear it
for the
drunks.

it's not the drink that kills, it's
the drunk, the problem drinker,
the abusive drinker, the drunk
driver. This year he'll be involved
in the killing of at least 25.000
people. He'll be involved in at
least 800,000 highway crashes.
After all the drunk driver has
done for us, what can we do for
him? If he's sick, let’s help him.
But first we've got to get him
off the road.

Do something. Write the Na-
tional Safety Council, Dept. A,
425 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago,
lllinois 60611. And your voice
will be heard.

Governor Rockefeller recently
announced that. New York State’s
annual traffic death toll last year
declined for the first time in five
years.

The Commissioner said u prelim-
inary report of 1970 traffic fatal-
ities compiled by the Department
of Motor Vehicles showed that
3,152 motorists and pedestrians
had been killed, a decline of 118
deaths from the record 3,200 re-
ported in 1969.

The report showed a sharp drop
in urban truffle deaths, down 17.3
percent from u year ago, while the
rate of rural traffic deaths remain-
ed unchanged. New York City
reported u slight increase of 3.6
percent.

Safety Devices Credited

For Decreasing Fatalities

Vincent L. 'I‘ofany told the
Governor the overall improvement
resulted front many fuctors, in-
cluding the increased use of auto-
motive safety equipment, which
"reflect the growing impact of the
pioneering traffic safety programs
introduced by you and approved
by the Legislature.“

The ttrcu breakdown for the
entire your shows 1,821 rurul fn-
tnlitics, the same total reported
for 1969'. 387 urbun deaths, or Hi
less; and 944 New York City
deaths, iln increase of 33. Pedes-
trian ftttttlitics totaled 1,028, an
increase of 49.

Previously, the State’s annual
traffic death toll bud climbed each
your since 1965, when a one-year
decrease was reported.

New legislation would make prescription drug prices competitive.

Rockefellerﬂemocrats (Miter
Complies: Consumer Legislation

(iovcrnor liockL-fcllt-r nskcd the logislnturo last
work to rcquin- grout-rs to list the price per unit of
food and other consumer products.

“'l‘oduy, ilIL' variety of sizes in boxr-s, (inns and

to (lt‘lt'l'l‘nillt‘ the pl‘iCt' per unit of it product without

tho lcgislnlurv.

“But this prior» information is irrdispcnsnblc if llit‘
consumer is to make intelligent compurisons bu-
twccn products, brands and package sizes. Unit
pricing will help the consumer make this comparison
rcudily,

The proposal was contained in a wide-ranging
package of consumer legislation. Other measures
would:

—Prohibit :1 retailer or finance company from

buyer defaults on an installment purchase.

—Limit the pluce of trinl in lawsuits arising out of
consumer transactions to the county where the

Democrats Respond

Scruttc Minority Leader Joseph Zaretski and As-
sembly Minority Lender Stanley‘ Steingut rc-
sponded Saturday to Hockcl‘cller's proposals with u
Dcmocrntic legislative pnckngc designed to protect
cvcry consumer in the state.

"We were not surprised to note the Governor's
proposed cunsumcr protection progrum reflects
cutter-pus and legislation we have long espoused,
including both unit pricing and the purchase of
drugs by their generic rather than their trade.
names," the Democratic leaders Silld.

“Our program again this your goes beyond the
Govurnor's proposals. It is aimed at ending con-
sumer abuses tht have been permitted to exist far
too long.

The seven point program follows:

1. Requires the licensing of all uuto repair shops
and mechanics. Auto repair shop licenses would be
renewed every two years. Mcchunic licenses would
be permanent. Licenses would be revoked for
various infractions including incumpcttrncy and
I'ruud.

2. Provides for the liccnsing of’l‘V renuir shops

3. Provides for the licensing and bonding of truvor
agencies.

4. Requires the licensing of process servers.

5. Permits :1 three-day grucc period for a home
owner to cancel zr contract for home improvement
repairs.

6, Pruvitlt-s for illt‘ licensing of home improvement
comptmit-s.

7. Prohibits it confession of judgment clause in
rt-tnil installment snlcs scrvicv contracts. This bill
givvs one who enters into such a contract the right
durmd n suit against him growing out of the
installment snic.
