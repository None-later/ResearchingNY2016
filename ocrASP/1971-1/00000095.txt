The Jan Scene

Almost Home— MGM SE-4708—
The destruction of the firm lines
that could never successfully limit
rock music, but always tried, is an
optimistic occurrence for two rea-
sons. Both are evident in this
album,

Firstly, music, if it doesn‘t grow,
and expand, begins to sound
distinctly derivative causing bore—
dom,stagnation and finally death.
This can be seen quite readily in
"Rock 'n' Roll Band II" which
dates back nearly to Little
Richard despite the inclusion of
new developments of guitar
played by Joe Parrino.

"Sing Your Song“ also uses an
oft tried combination of soul and
Rock with a simple, whistle-able
instrumental bridge. But they fair
much better because they are not
attempting to either mimic or
imitate. The song developes gradu-
ally in volume and reaches an
acceptable, but not offensive
peak.

“Waiting Hymn" is a folk-rock
ballad. It is well sung and the use
of clarinet is of interest, but leaves
much to be desired. “First Born"
is the most memorable song on
the album. it begins with a 13
note descending bass line that is
altered to a catchy country blues
vocal, with some help from
Christ‘s strong harmonica playing.
it finally is given a hard kick by
Ron Allard's raspy tenor.

The trilogy is a most ambitious

r "inn and quite interesting.

IF ( CAPITOL 51539)
IF2 (CAPITOL SW-676)

Yes, kiddies, we have here yet
another group out of the same
Blood, Sweat, and Tears-Chicago
mold that so many rocks jazz
bands have evolved from. It's IF,
an eight man band from England
and boy, are they groovy!

While CHICAGO leans more
towards rock than to jazz and
B.S.T. doesn't know which way to
turn, It“ has an inclination
towards jazz. There aren‘t too
many solos on their first album
which is a bit disconcerting be-
cause the lead singer J.W. Hodg-
kinson is a very predictable and
unspectacular singer.

The best cut on the album is the
instrumental “What Did 1 Say
About The Box, Jack‘.’, (dig the
clever title) which includes two
solid solos by Dick Morrisscy on
flute rind alto sax. It is the only
song in which the brass outline
creates a personality for the melo-
dy.

The guitar solos by Terry Smith
seem to have been recorded on
one track and parcelcd out to
each individual song when a solo
was needed.

It’s a shame that the singing is
not exciting because tlicrc are
some good lyrics here, particularly
in “The Promised Land" and “I'm
Reaching Out On All Sides."

IF2 is a little more promising if
Only because Dennis Elliott's
drumming is improved and Hodg-
klnson‘s vocals are at times more
convincing. But what rmlly annoys
the about this group is that there
Is usually only one element that
manages to ruin a whole song

Your City is Falling" has to
overcome Jim Richardson’s fccu-
lent bass which destroys the
thole foundation of the cut-
Shadows and Echos“ is a very
Pretty fluttl based thcmc until
Smith destroys the mood of the
50m; with an overvnggrcssivc guitar
solo.

“Sunday Sad" can be disregar
ded because Smith's ﬂamenco
guitar is so pathetic. lf Sabicas
heard this, he would be speechless
for weeks, “Tarmac T. Pirate And
The Lonesome Nymphoniac"
(gosh, these guys are clever) is
reject Chicago material.

I think the whole concept of
rock-jaw. hands has gotten out of
hand, in the past year we have
heard from CLOUDS, DREAMS,
GAS MASK, etc, all bands with
some good talent but generally
lacking in new ideas. What madc
the Tony Williams concert so
special was that the group had
some brand new ideas to offer,
and were willing to take risks and
experiment [because they were
playing for themselves and not an
audience]. It‘s hard for me to get
excited when I get the impression
that a group like [F is doing
something that so many others
havc (lonc before and bcltcr.

It points out the second reason
for experimentation. That is, new
sounds are cheloped, and al-
though this cannot be judged a
complete success much good
should come of this.

The first part, “Lifeline” has a
restful flavor with some impres-
sionistic piano. The transition is
smooth as the beat speeds up.

The second part,“The Exam-
plc", is alternately in routine rock
protest and a slow Scottish march.
lt's ending sounds too much like a
rock show tune

The wide range of musical his-
tory in this group contributes to
its originality, yet inhibits natu-
ralness which is equally impor-
tant. This will probably be over-
come with practice. Meanwhile
there are some enjoyable, worth-
while track on this album

Stan (iclx's Marnrlicr/r lixprcxs
(MGM-1806) is a terrible disap-
tlial his creativity is hidden is
both sad and unncccssury. The

songs are both popular and listen-
able, but although it features a
pleasant round on tenor there is
no room left forimprovisation or
even embellishment with a few
rare and minor cxccp I wish
record producers would realize
that jazz musicians do not have to
be successful commercially. The
financial benefits being reaped by
such people as Herbie Mann, Miles
Davis, Eddie Harris and Jimmy
Smith proves that; and it wuld be
nice if every once in a while
musicians like (3th would be pre-
sented in a purely jazz setting.
Jazz will live eternally if record
companies begin to respect rather
than prostitute porfomers'

“The Immigrant" the final seg-
ment, begins as an academic piano
but developes into some
rock sounds that are,

solo,
unusual

once again, helped admirably by
Allard, this time on clarinet.

All musicians on this album are
quite proficient and practised.
Their backgrounds are admirably
diverse. leader Murphy has com-
posed show tunes and his compo-
sition reflect that background
here both for good and bad. Ron
Allard has a respectable, if parti-
ally anonymous, experience in
jazz having played with Dizzy
Gillespie and Clark Terry. George
Christ has a folk background. Joe
Parrino is an expert in electronics,
and i imagine that is quite helpful
in the recording booth. Although
Bobby Kurtz has basically a rock
past he was born in Brazil, where
his father is a composer of some
stature, and the music of that
nation has probably contributed
immensely to his scope of drum-
ming.
