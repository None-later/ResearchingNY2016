ESP Revisited

A few weeks ago I did a column on extra-sensory perception (or
ESP, as it is called by its many friends and relatives). The amount of
mail I received from you about this column, dear readers, was so heavy
that I ﬁnd myself with a heart full of gratitude. (I also find myself
with a ruptured postman.) I would of course like to write each one of
you personally, but that is obviously not possible, so 1 will try to
answer some of your questions in today's column.

QUESTION: [Amt night I tried on ESP experiment with my boy-
friend, Precoa Nissen. IIc sat in one room and wrote a fist of numbers.
I not in another room and tried to guess who! numbers he was writing.
Out of 25 tries I guessed wrony 25 ti'ines. I feel icky and worthless and
have decided to kill myself. What/alum can a person trove without ESP?

ANSWER: You must not despair. Lots of people without ESP
manage to live useful and productive lives. For example, there was a
coed at Duke a few yours ago, Maud Gonder by mime, who tried guess-
ing numbers, just as you did. In fact, she tried it every single day for
the entire four years she spent at Duke, and all she ever got was wrong
numbers. But it didn’t hurt her one bit. Miss Grinder today is goin-
fully employed as a telephone operator in Durham, North Carolina.

 

QUESTION: This has nothing to do with It‘h'l', it’ll mtll/ilr‘ you can
tell me uni/how. ll’hotcon you rfoforiiru hair?
ANSWER: Wear a wet hat.

QUESTION: My ESP tells inc I was put on earth to do sonic triad
of irnportaiifjofi, but I don't know who! if is. Sofur I've had hundreds of
Jobs and I still liaiii-ii'l found IIu' right illit'. How will I know when I do."

ANSWER: You’ll know, don't worry. Take, for example, llic 1a~
mous ease of [fans llclmut Slcppcnwolf. He too know he was born for
some exalted task, but what? First he worked in Kansas glcaning beans
but that wasn't it, so he got a job with a logging firm in Montana.
Here the erstwhile beiin-glcuncr worked as a stump-thumpcr. llut that
wasn't it either, so he moved to North Dakota where he tendcil the
furnace in a granary (wheat-heater). 'l'lion hc moved to Omaha and
got a job admitting cattle to the stockyurdn (meat-greetcr). Then he
went to New Orleans and worked for 11 i-hiropoilist (feci-ircatcr). Then
to Minnesota where he cut up frozen hikes (iee~slicer1. Then to 1.1m
Vegas where he determined odds iit a crap table (dii'c-priccr). '1‘hcn to
Germany where be pasted camera lenses together (Zeiss-splicer).

Still Hana Hclmut hadn't found it. Back to America he moved
and got a job in Milwaukee at the Miller High Life brewery, inspecting
the ingredients that go into Miller High Life Beer and rejecting those
which were not perfect (malt-faulter).

And so finally, at long last, fulfillment l'lllliil to Hana lit-lmut. For
this was his mission, his lofty purpose on carth— to make sure that you
and I and every other lilo—loving, health-oriented, flavor-directed
American should rest secure hi the knowledge that the next can or
bottle of Miller High Life which passes our discriminating lips will he
just as free of deck and flow as the last ciin or bottle of Miller lligh
Life which passed our discriminating lips; that can after can, hottlc
after bottle, keg after keg, Miller High Life will remain over amber,
ever ambroslal, over honest, sincere, true, good, beautiful, decent,
kindly and relevant.

And so, dear friends, to that small but shining list of hunuin henc-
factora—mon like E. I‘lurlbus Ewbank, for instance, who Invented tho
opposable thumb without which millions of caatiinot players would be
unemployed; women like Rosa L. Slgafoos, for instance, who invented
the bio-degradable roommate—lot ua humbly and gratefully add the
name of Hana 'llolmut Stoppenwolf. Right on, watchful malt-faulturl

of them must ratify to make the
amendment effective.

Congress attempted last year
by legislation to lower the voting
age to 18 in all elections, but the
Supreme Court held the law is
constitutional only with respect
to elections for federal officials.

Adoption of the proposed
constitutional amendment would
do away with the dual-age voting
system resulting from the Court's
decision.

Sponsors hope ratification
can be completed in time for
elections in 1972, opening all bal-
lot boxes to about 11 million
Americans between the ages 01' 18
and 21.

They noted that the 19th
amendment, extending the iron-
chisc to women, was ratified by
the states in loss than 15 months.

Approval of the 18-year-old
vote amendment followed lhe
Senate’s rejection of another pru-
posi-(l constitutional amendment
by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., Iii give tlic District of
Columbia full voting represen-
lalion in Coiigrcssjiist like a state.

Kennedy offered his amcnd-
mcnl as a l‘ifit‘l' to thc olhcr
ami-nrliiicni, but on the motion of
Majority Leader Mikc Mansfield,
