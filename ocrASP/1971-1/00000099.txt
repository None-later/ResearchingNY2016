0n Capitol Hill: Reality vs.

The perennial struggle for state
aid to parochial schools has not
ended on Capital Hill. This year,
however, the Catholic Church
has given up its ﬁght to repeal
the 77-year or Blaine Amend-
ment. The emotional issue of
Blaine has been determined to be
irrelevant and ineffectual, and
therefore a side show to the most
important fight for the Church,
that is, government subsidization
of parochial schools, or parents
who send their children to such
schools.

Instead, the Church has lobbied
for a “parent-aid" bill, which
would grant subsidies based on
need to parents who send their
children to parochial schools.
This session, this bill was intro-
duced by the Late Senator
Speno, and into Assembly by Mr.
Lerner.

The bill, of course, is being
vigorously opposed by the New

York Civil Liberties Union,
which maintains that it violates
the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution. The
NYCLU believes that the bill or
any other bill similar to it vio-
lates the principle of the separa-

 

tion between church and state.
The individual taxpayer under
the bill would be forced to fi-
nance directly or indirectly the
teaching of a religionuthe specif-
ic religion is irrelevant. (Yeshivas
that are asking for state aid

Principle

closing of parochial schools as a
valid argument for SpenO-Lcrner
bears no relevance to the civil
libertarian principle of the sepa-
ration of church and state. Either
the state funding of parochial
schools is a valid and rational
principle in itself or it is not.

To appeal to the consequences
of the defeat of Speno-Lerncr is
expedient for the Senators and
Assemblyman who intend to
vote for it, but such expediency
is not responsible. The Governor
and the legislators took office
upon the oath that they would -
uphold both the Federal and
State Constitution.

Unfortunately, as one Senator
from the Minority said, principle
is irrelevant at this stage of the
debate. Not only have the Courts
upheld the constitutionality of
aid in the form of textbooks,
lunches, and transportation, but
the state would save money by
only subsidizing parochial
will have to close. This ad conse- schools instead or taking them
quenlum argument WhICh “588 over as some people have suggest
the possible consequences of the ad,

violate the principle as well).

The advocates of this bill main-
tain that if state money is not
forthcoming, parochial schools

Carlson Judgement Classified Information

by Victoria Foreman

Helen Carlson, of the English department here at SUNYA seems to be the latest victim
of tenure-itis. She has lost the recommendation of the English faculty and is now facing
the end of her career here if a presentation of her qualifications does not get the
department‘s negative decision reversed.

The reasons why recommendation was refused seem to be hidden behind non-
committal comments. A number of students are gathering information and tangible
support in order to obtain a recommendation of tenure for her from the College of Arts
and Sciences. However, because of the vague reasons motivation those against her, they
are having problems knowing who and what to fight.

Some of these students have talked to several department members about Mrs.
Carlson. Two members admitted to these students that they did not know anything
about her, hardly giving consideration to her published works, classroom performance,
and her dissertation. They commented on how hard it was to get to know the woman,
seeming to place a good deal of emphasis on her amiability. If this decided their votes,
they were most likely against her. She seems to be the independent of the department,
her intelligence and integrity not shown in social gatherings, but in poetry and her
classroom performance (the latter, none of which her colleagues observed.) As far as her
poetry is concerned, one would hope considerable thought was given to her talent since
the second major consideration for tenure recommendation is the publication of
scholarship and/or other creative work.

There are members of that faculty who were shocked by the dissent against Mrs.
Carlson, expressed in conversation by some. It didn't seem to occur to Mrs. Carlson and
the faculty supporting her that she had somehow created personal enemies within the
department. Some students recall comments from a particular professor who went so far
as to call Mrs. Carlson totally inept, without offering evidence supporting this criticism.
Later, in an interview, that same professor gave no indication of any personal grievance

against Helen Carlson. Where the discrepancy lies is debatable.

Presumably, the most influential member of a department is the chairman, in this case,
Dr. Walter Knotts. So an interview with him seemed the most logical way to obtain
considerable comment concerning Mrs. Carlson's non-recommendation. On this point, I
was considerably mistaken, He made quite clear what he did not say.

Besides getting a detailed answer to myquestion on the University tenure procedure, h1-
would not commit himself to any specifics concerning helen Carlson herself. I asked Dr
Knotts, as a member of the tenured voting faculty in matters of recommendation, iflw
felt her to be qualified for tenure. His answer was “no comment." The same response
followed my questions on whehter or not he would give her a favorable recommendation
to the College of Arts and Sciences, which reviews and can reverse faculty decisions. Up
to now, Dr. Knotts seemed reluctant, to say the least, to divulge his opinions. I asked
him, as chairman of the department, if he would give Mrs. Carlson a recommendation
granting her mobility in the university system if she does leave her position here, “That
would concern Mrs. Carlson and myself," was his reply. Nor would he give me answers
bteyond “no comment" on Mrs. Carlson.s poems other than the fact that he had read
t em.

As it stands, Mm Carlson's student supporters can only turn to the College of Arts and
Sciences in hope of a recommendation. With enough evidence they can get that, but,
they will have to do this without tangilbe support from members of the department. Dr.
Knotts called it normal procedure for a member of the faculty to go through channels if
first recommendations is not approved by the department On the other hand it seems
normal procedure for those channels to deny recommendation because of the first
negative decision in the case of any instructor who has lost that primary battle within
his or her department. After all, how many teachers can you recall who have gotten II
faculty decision reversed in this manner? In so many cases, it seems to have been the
last. If this is true, let's hope there is another institution of higher education that can
rccognizo Mrs. Carlson's qualifications and the talent and devotion so many of lll'r
students believe she has.

Swimmers 8th in State

The Men's Varsity Swim Team
finished their season this past
weekend when they traveled to
St. Bonaventure to compete in the
_New York State Swimming As~
sociation's Swimming and Diving
Championships. Albany coach
Brian Kelly had predicted a 10th
place finish from his club, which
has been surprising him all year
with new records and exceptional
performances. The state meet was
no exception as the team did
better than expected and placed
8th.

Albany acquired 106% points
as each relay team placed and
many of the men in individual
events did better than Coach Kel-

.. ly had figured on. Albany’s 800
' yard Freestyle Relay team was the

best of the relays as they placed
sixth. The team was composed of
Leonard Van Ryn, Peter Gersten-

Puretz. The 400 yard Freestyle
team (Van Ryn, Jaik Schubert,
John Dragich, and Ed Daniels)
was 8th, and the 400 yard Medley
Relay team (Dempsey, Purctz,
William Hurt, David Callahan) was
ninth.

In the individual events
Leonard Van Ryn, impressed with
a 4th in the 400 yard Individual
Medley, and a 6th in the 500 yard
Freestyle. Peter Gerstcnhaber
added a 4th in the 200 Yard
Butterfly, and a 7th in the 400
yard Individual Medley. William
Hart placed 7th and 8th in the
200 yard backstroke and the 100
yard backstroke, respectively. In
the 1650 yard Freestyle event,
George Dempsey finished 9th as
did Jaik Schubert in the 200 yard
Butterfly. David Callahan showed
a 10th in both the 100 and 200
yard Butterﬂy, and Isaac Wilson

Coach Kelly is looking for-
ward to an exceptional season
next year as no man on this year‘s
team is a senior and they look to
form a solid core for next year's
squad. The team this weekend
proved themselves to be very
strong in Butterﬂy, Backstroke,
Individual Medley, and long dis-
tance Freestyle competition. Next
year, they hope to acquire some
more general depth and especially
some more Breaststrokers and
Freestyle sprinters.
