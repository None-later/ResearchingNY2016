CUT: The cut of a diamond—the
facets placed on it by a trained
cutter—brings out the gcm's fire

II" I COULD ONLY REMEMBER
MY NAME David Crosby (All-
untic, SD 7203).

This is an album of incredible
depth and beauty. The personnel
includes, in addition to Crosby,
Graham Nash, Neil Young, Joni
Mitchell, Grace Slick, Puul Kant-
ncr, Juck Cusudy, Jormu Kuuk-
oncn and Jerry Gurciu...and that's
a Very partial listing. Some of the
songs are authored by Crosby
alonc; othch arc C()~IllILllUrt3d by
Gnrcin, Young and some of the
rest.

Musically, this album is softer
than liluws Against the Empire
(which uses much of the same
personnel). Crosby's LP shows the
influence of Neil Young, acoustic
Dead, and the Airplane nad
CSN&Y, in their quiet moods.
Lyricully, ii is reminiscent ol'such
songs as the Byrtls' "Dral'l Morn-
ing" in its subtle awareness of the
war and of the alienation that We
all feel: “I thought I knew the
mun/Who said he knew a man/
Who knew what was going on/l
was mistaken/Only another stran-
ger..." And, in the song “What
Are Their Names?" we hear: "I
wonder who they are] The men
who really run this land/Anti I
wonder why they run ii/With such
a thoughtless hund/Whut are their
names/And on what streets do
they livc'.’/l'tl like to rltlt‘ right
over/This afternoon and give/
Them a piece of my mind..."

The album is a smooth synthesis
of the various groups and artists
represented, with Crosby‘s style
predominating. Lyricully, it is a

comfort in the midst of insanity,
and but another demonstration
that the title of the firt cut is
true: “Music is Love." If that's
where you‘re at, you might want
to tukc a little of the love offered
here.

Discs

Zepplinish style exhibited by their
previous LP, The guitar work is
fast and expressive; the vocals
demonstrate a wide range and an
ability to evoke a great variety of
emotions, from humor to anger to
sexuality. The album is true to the
rock and roll tradition from which
it is drawn, a case in point being
Cnctus' version of Little Richard‘s
"Long Tall Sally."

Lyrically, the album is less suc-
cessful. The group wrote most of
the songs; the theme throughout
can be summed up by this line:
“Yeah i like to rock and I like to
roll. Most of all, durlin' I like to
ball." (Traces of MCB?) Here, the
lyrics are mostly repetitive and
lacking in imagination; still, as
often happens with rock, they are
saved by their musical context,
which blends with the lyric, giving
validity to that which could not
sluntl alone,

'I'I'l/NGS WE LIKI'J
Jack Bruce (Atco, SDiiii-ii‘lil).
This "new" Jack Bruce LP was
actually recorded 2% years ago,
but was not released in the Stutcs
until now. It features such sitch
men as John McLaughlin and Dick
HeckstuIl-Smith. The recording is
low-keyed, unstructured jazz. Al.
best, it is a rich and flowing
experiment; at worst, it falls apart
and tends to lost its direction.
With few exceptions, however, it
is enjoyable if you're listening,
for example, to Miles Davis, then
there’s no reason why you
shouldn't be lixlcning to Jack

Capitalists Eye
Pot Market

by Charles Foley
College Press Writer

SAN FRANCISCO (CPS)—— Marijuana is now as American as Spiro
Agnew’s daughter—or so say forward-thinking executives of US.
tobacco ﬁrms who have been covertly eyeing the underground market
in "grass", ofﬁcially valued at better than a billion dollars a year.

The real figure, say Western entrepreneurs, is nearer three times that
sum, and now that the possibilities of legal manufacture arelbeing
discussed in the boardroom, bootleg suppliers are organmng to
safeguard their interests.

Long before New Years Day, when the government shut down a
$250 million advertising industry by banning cigarette commercuils on
television, the tobacco man had been busy on contingency planning—
one firm is allegedly running a furtive sale test scheme in Hawaii. At
the start the big manufacturers would market their joints at about 25
cents each, well under current black market prices.

Business sources predict the end of the marijuana ban will follow
the close of the Nixon era, for the soundly all-American reason that
the swollen costs of the linew prohibition" exceed any good it may
do. Enforcement costs in California alone are now running at $32
million a year and courts are clogged with untried cases, Already 23
states have cased penalties, with more to follow. I

Former U.S. Attorney, John Kuplun, a Stanford University Law
professor, and an authority on the subject, said this week that
marijuana “could and should“ be legalized. l-le inclines to u
government monopoly which would rule out advertising. Packets of
the weed, graded by strength and heavily taxed, might be sold In
government-licensed shops. Mr. Kuplan believes this open system
would discourage use, particularly by toen-ugers. Iicvvnuc woulti help
to step up control of “hard” drugs.

But the underground does not mean to yield its rich, quasi-sacred
[truss market to the big-money men. “It's the economic basis of tho
counter-culture, suys Blair Newman, a prominent Sun Frunctsco pol
advocate, “We have to lump it out of the hands of the tobacco
tycoons.“

Believing legislation will come “within three years," Newman and
his friends hch formed a “philanthropic," tlt)ll~prt)f|l organization
called Amorphiu, to stake their claim.

MortI confident still is a San Francisco consortium of pot dealt-rs
known collectively as Felix the Cut. “h’llll‘ljilililil is legal," they say

Women’s Studies Gains
Academic Toehold

WASHINGTON, D.C. (CPS)— Like the civil rights and black power mOVements before it, the women's
liberation movement has brought demands for new courses on a number of campuses. According to one
estimate, 55 colleges and universities are now offering one or more courses that can be classified as

“women’s studies. "

The call for women’s studies has grown out of a feeling on the part of many women faculty members
and students that women are being largely ignored by most of the academic disciplines, and that too much
of the study of women is being done by men.

Natalie Davis, professor of history at the University of Toronto, says that only she and two other
historians, one of them a man, are currently studying the history of women.

“I've been trying to do some research on sexual attitudes of women and all I get from my male

colleagues is a tee-bee or a ho-ho ,

depending on how many are in the room," says Judith Long Laws,

assistant professor of social psychology at the University of Chicago.
The issues being raised are strikingly similar to those faced by black students:
Should men be excluded from teaching or studying in the subject?
Should women '3 studies be a separate department , an interdisciplinary program, or simply a scattering

of courses?

Can women's studies be primarily academic or are they sure to become militant and tied to women‘s

liberation?

Like black studies, women’s studies programs have faced severe problems in getting approval from
faculty members and administrators, and in getting the funds and faculty positions needed to get started.

One of the first women's studies courses in other than a Free University setting was started at Cornell
University. Entitled “Evolution of Female Personality," it grew out of a conference on women at Cornell
and a faculty seminar on female studies.

San Diego State College had the
first full-ﬂedged women's studies
program. Its organizers hope that
eventually it will develop into a
women's studies center, including
course offerings, research , a child-
care fncility, and a community
center.

Courses now ineludc,"Women in
Comparative Cultures", "Sociali'
zation Process of Women," "Self-
Actualization of Women," “Con-
temporary Issues in the Liberation
of Women," “Women in History,"
“Human Sexuality", "Status of
Women Under “Various Economic
Systems,"" Women and Educa-
tion," and “Field Experience."

The men in the program, 20 per
cent of the enrollment, are operat-
ing a child-care center so the
women can attend the meetings.

Some of the program‘s difficul-
ties in getting funds and staff have
been the result of a tight, financial
situation in the California col-
leges, but the women also say
they have encountered consider»
able faculty and administration
resistance.

"Many faculty members take it
as a joke," says Roberta Sniper,
the visiting professor in the pro-
gram.“’l‘hcy make comments like:
"I‘his is absurd. Women come to
college to get husbands and we all
know that.”

No women's studies programs
have excluded men as students,
and most women don‘t seem to
think they should. But there is
much more opposition to having
me" on the faculty.

“I have n strong bias in favor of
female colleagues, having never
had any," snys Luws. “I do not
think it‘s necessary to hch a
token chnuvinist on the faculty to
keep us honest. There are plenty
of chuuvinists out there to criti~
cizc our work."
