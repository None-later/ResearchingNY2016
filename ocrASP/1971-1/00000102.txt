ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

SNOW REMOVAL

The events concerning the Al-

, bany snow removal costs for last

winter came to the limelight again

””' this week in court action, but to

understand the complicated mat-

ter, a review of the events is‘
necessary. ‘

The' snow removal matter began
more than a year ago, on Christ-
mas Day, 1969, a 'Ihursday. Be-
tween Thursday and Sunday, a
total of 26.4 inches came down,
rendering the streets and highways
of the entire Capital District
impassable.

In Albany, dozens of trucks,
plows, front-end loaders, graders
and bucket scoops were pressed
into the fight as first the main
artery. and eventually the second-
ary streets, were opened. City
ofﬁcials were operating under
emergency strains.

It was not until January 22,
1971 that Mayor Erastus Corning

announced that the cleanup
would cost a “minimum” of
$300,000 in addition to the

$239,000 already budgeted for
snow and ice removal. The mayor
said a special section of the law
allowed him to bond the emergen-
cy expense and the amount rose
to $500,000 when the bond issue
was presented to the Common
Council for approval in February,
meaning the total cost had now
risen to well over $700,000.

OR SNOW JOB ?

Then on June 1, 1971, the
aldermen met and were informed
in a piece of legislation before
them that the cost was now being
adjusted to $2.1 million total.

The $2.1 million story was
printed in a local newspaper the
morning of June 2 and Repub-
lican District Attorney Arnold
Ptoskin’s probe began several days
later.

The case was given to the April
term of the grand jury, which
subpoenaed Mayor Coming in Au-
gust to produce all city records on
the snow removal. The mayor and
a couple of aides delivered several
cardboard cartons filled with
vouchers, checks and warrants to
the jury room where they were
tagged and receipted. Corning
testified briefly in the secret ses-
sion, presumably identifying the
records.

Contractors and their employees
were subpoenaed in subsequent
weeks, along with their books.
Corporate and individual records
began to be matched against city
records of payment.

All the while, the grand juries
were forced to meet on a frequent
basis, usually weekly, to accept
evidence or question a witness.

The investigation moved quietly
through the fall and early winter
until the jury handed up the
indictments on February ii in

County Court.

Those indicted were:

Arnold Leto, president of the
Leto Paving Company, charged as
corporate ofﬁcer of the firm, with
ﬁling fraudulent claims and grand
larceny in the amount of $25,771,
and as an individual in the amount
of $20,712.

Richard Leto, his brother,
charged with filing fraudulent
claim and grand larceny in the
amount of $22,477.

Leo Demeris, charged with ﬁling
fraudulent claims and grand lar-
ceny in the amount of $25,771.

Leto Paving Company, Fuller
Road, charged with filing fraud-
ulent claims and grand larceny in
the amount of $25,771.

City Alderman Joseph Lynn Jr.,
of the Fourth Ward, and Marvin
Tanksley, of the Third, charged
with violation of Section 805 of
the Municipal Law. They are
charged with having a direct inter-
est in city contracts as a result of
payments made to them for work
performed during the winter.
Lynn rcccived $3,264; Tanksley,
$5,368. Both men are Democrats
in thc all-Democratic Common
Council.

Joseph Leto, also it brother of
Arnold Leto, who was charged
after the original indictments were
made on February ll.

The day the indictments were
served, the attorncy for the Lcto
Brothers, Gene Spiidii, charged
that Republican political machi-
nations arc behind the indict-
ments, and that dawn arrests of
the men—in front of their chil-
dren-were “totally unnecessary."

He charged that Albany District
Attorney Arnold Proskin "is pro-
cccding along the lines dictiitcd by
the Republican powers that be,"
lines which he said were drawn by
former Assemblyman Raymond
C. Skuse acting as a mouthpiece
for county GOP Chairman Joseph
Frangellii.

“This is an election year and it
sccms to me an obvious attempt
at pulilicily...(to) place the Demo
ci'ntic organization in a bad light,"
he stated.

Not only arc the Lctos innocent,
he claimed, but they were under-
paid for thc work they pcrformcd
after the massch snowfall.

Spada further chiirgcd that thc

who worked for the city (during
snow removal) have appeared be-
fore the grand jury."

Proskin, in his press conference
minutes after Spada had made his
remarks, termed the defense coun-
sel's charges “not even worthy of
comment. There is no truth to the
allegations."

Spada said he hoped the mat-
ter could be brought to trial.
The district attorney said the mat-
ter would be placed on the court
calendar and a trial would prob-
ably not be held for at least six
months.

Proskin also announced that the
investigation would continue for
three or four months.

This week the trials began for
those indicted. Joseph M. Lynn
Jr., Alderman from the Fourth
Ward, was cleared Tuesday of a
misdemeanor charge resulting
from last year’s snow removal
program. The ruling by County
Judge Schenck dismissed the in-
dictment on the grounds that
grand jury minutes showed no
evidence of an essential clement
of the alleged crime, the “willful
and knowing" violation of the
General Municipal Law.

Alderman Lynn Wits the first of
six persons indicted by the grand
jury to go to trial.

in a related point brought out in

Tuesday's trial, Common Council
President Richard J. Connors tes-
tified that Lynn was not it
member of the Council in Decem-
ber 1969, when the original funds
for snow removal were budgetcd.
City records show Lynn was paid
out of the original fund iippropri~
ated.
City Comptroller Hoffman
stated that the supplemental
bonds Junc lll7()
have never been sold.

On Wednesday, the day after
Lynn's trial, Aldcrniiin Marvin
'l‘unkslcy til‘l’lVL‘tl at County Unilrt

approved in

for trial and to lcslil'y bcl'oi'c the
continuing grand jury but. neither

attorney to show cause why cer-
tain speciﬁc relief should be grant-
ed" was argued before Judge
Schenck.

The tables were turned when

district Attorney Proskin was
charged with misconduct by at-
torneys for Leo Demeris. He was
accused of currying the favor of
the grand jurors by inviting them
into his home and serving them
alcoholic beverages. Judgc
Schcnck rcscrved decision on the
defense motion.

At a news conferenco after the
hearing, comments were made by
both Demcris' attorney and
Proskin.

Attorney Kohen states: “The
DA entertained in his home mem-
bers of the very grand jury that
brought in these indictments and
that. an irregularity and an of-
fense that is legally considcrcd
almost indescribable."

Proskin denied the misconduct
charge but admitted that grand
jurors came to his home at their
request to review transcripts of
thc county jail investigation, He
said that they had also met scvcriil
times in various offices. Proskin
said no drinks were served and
snow removal was never discussed.
He said the statements by Reuben
and Richard Kohen were personal
political attacks.

“I am not backing down on
anything that l‘m doing. l’m not
going to be scared off. lfsomconc
wants to attack me, personally.
that's all well iind good but as far
as I‘m concerned there’s been no
improprictics conducted by me-
—by me or by any member of my
office. We hich walked a fine line
to make suri- we handle things in it
most proper basis."

memo. . .1-

 

 

by Tom Clingm

The much-publicized Student
Association new constitution
failed to pass in last week's refer—
endum by over 200 votes. This is
the opinion of the officers of
Student Association after long dis-
cussion on exactly how many
undergraduate students there are.

Though the vote was over-
whelmingly in favor of the new
constitution (1170 yes, 209 no,
188 abstain), the measure ap-
parently did not draw the neces-
sary 20% of the electorate. David

Neufeld, S.A. President, in giving
the returns, said, "To the best of
our knowledge and belief, it did
not pass.”

The same went for the other
two questions appearing on the
same ballot with the constitution.
Both the question of MYSKANIA
composition (passed, 1095- 265-
202) and the nomination of Suv
preme Court judges (passed, 796-
432- 335) needed a similar 20%,
which neither achieved.

One of the more interesting as-
pects of the defeat is the utter
lack of knowledge about the size

   
        

of the undergraduate cl'ass. By
accepted definition, anyone tak-
ing undergraduate courses is a
member of Student Association.
Under 6 credits per semester, stu-
dents pay nothing. General studies
(not towards any degree) is also
free. All of these people get tax
cards, so all must be counted in
any real estimation of the size of
S.A. Such an estimate runs as
high as 9,000. Other figures range
from 8,000 and up. in any case,
the 1562 ballots cast are only 20%
of 7810, a number which is way
too low to be an adequate repre-

sentation of undergraduate class
size.

According to S.A. ,Vice-
President Mike Lampert, a re-
definition or‘ the membership
would be impossible now because
“since everyone gets a tax card,
anyone could have voted." He
went on to say that, barring any
conﬂicting information about the
number of undergrads from the
Administration, the constitution
did not pass.

Cited as major reasons for the
disappointing turnout were gene-
ral apathy and the complication

 

'ot‘ thehallot with other questions.
“It's very difﬁcult to get people
to vote on constitutions," said
Neufeld. 'l‘he apathy cost Student
Association, besides aggravation.
some $200.00 in election costs. If
the constitution has another try at
the polls, the cost will be at least
another $200.00.

An emergency meeting of Gen-
tral Council has been called for
Tuesdayto determine what course
of action will be taken. Neither
Neufeld nor Lampert would
speculate about what Council will
do.

Council Considers Proposal

For Non-Mandatory Board

by Allen Altman

The Living Area Affairs Com-
mission's proposal calling for the
separation of room and board
plans and making the board plan
non-mandatory was the center of
discussion at Thursday night‘s
Central Council meeting.

Robert Cooley, Executch Di-
rector of the Faculty Student
Association, appeared at the ince-
ting to answer questions and to
clarify his position.

The consequences that would be
involved in abolishing the
rmndulory plan were discussed in
length.

Coolcy‘s opinion was that if
room and board plans were sepa-
rated, thc price of board, which is
already being increased by 5%
next year, would hich to be raised
even further.

Cooley also suggested that it
might be possible to go to a
straight cash basis in all cafeterias,
eliminating the contract meal plan
entirely. The result of this plan
would be to raise prices of food
even more.

and small group discussions.

"i love teaching," stated l’erlmuttcr. "l’ve maln-
tiiincd ii full touching carucl’ while l‘vu been dean,"
he concluded.

With a separate board
plan, Food Service muldn't be
able to predict student demand
and plan ahead.

The effects that a separate board
plan would have on the dorms
also entered into the discussion.
Dick Wesley, Central Council
Member, pointed out that the
dorms are incapable of handling
any more electrical equipment that
would come about as ii result of
student cooking. Due to inade-
quate electricity in the dorms, any
increase in refrigerators or hot
plates could. cut. off all electricity
in the dorms. Furthermore, the
dorms would turn into dirty rat in-
fcstcd areas from the cooking of
food as it has occurred in other
colicch that how tried the sepa-
rutc board pliin. This would lead
to serious health problems in the
dorms which couldn't be tole-
rated.

Mike Lampert, Vice President of
Student Association, brought out
the point that whatever is decided
about the separate room and
board plan, it will infringe upon
the rights of somebodv.

Though Cooley cited that he
had no personal objections to the
separate room and board plan, he
wanted everyone involved to be

aware of the problems that would
arise

Reasons given by Cooley for the
5% raise in board next year in-
Volvcd the rising costs of food and
labor. In the past year the cost of
liibor and food has risen 20%.
Food Service has only asked for a
5% increase because of large sav-
ings realized through tighter con-
trol of dining areas during meal
hours allowing only contract meal
holdch in. This resulted in a 16%
reduction in costs in one quad
iilone.

Other Business

By a near unanimous vote, Cen-
tral Council gave its support to
the newly proposed Assembly Bill
No. 4635 (l971»72) which calls
for legalization of marijuana.

The bill would legalize the
sale of marijuana by licensed sel-
lers such as Pharmacies to anyone
ovcr 18 years of age. Notice of
Central Council’s support of the
bill will be mailed to Governor
Rockefeller, both Senators, and
each assemblyman.

After an hour's debate, Council
by a 94-12 vote decided to al-
locate $524 to Sweet Fire to help
fund the next two issues. Jack
Schwartz, editor of the paper, was
present to answer any questions—-

 

0. William Perlmutter will leave his position as Dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences in August.
