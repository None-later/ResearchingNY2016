The Jon Scene

 

 

by Bob Rosenbloom

Best of Buddy Rich (Pacific
Jazz): When an album title begins
with ‘_‘Best of..." it usually con-
tains either very good music, or
very bad music. This is mostly
because of the ambiguity inthe
word "best." Does'it mean most
popular or most creative? Well in
Buddy Rich’s case his most popu-
lar songs are usually his most
creative, which is what makes this
collection so good.

The only trite selection is “Mer-
cy.” Those familiar with the Rich
band have probably heard it be-
fore. It comes equipped with an
American lndian war dance, and a
stripper bent. Phil Wilson, who
wrote that particular chart, has
admitted it is merely a put-on;his
words are good enough for me.

 

“Norwegian Wood" has some
excellent drumming by Rich and
is a good arrangement. “New
Blues" has some nice trumpet and
sax voicings and a pretty melody.
“West SideStory" is another Rich
trademark and has all but become
his theme. His fills are powerful
and he drives the band through
the many phases of the Medley.
Rich is not usually a very interest-
ing soloist, but on this particular
track he outdoes himself, giving
one of the most outstanding drum
solos on record. His amazingly
fast hands are well integrated with
nimble feet and the accests and
paradiddles come at you like bul-
lets.

“Love For Sale" is well written
with some more excellent accom-
paniment by Rich. His short
break is especially effective.

“Channel 1 Suite” features an
excelllent extended solo by Don
Menza (partially a capella) and a
short but sprightly contribution
by the great altoist Art Pepper,
The song has a lot of drive and is
marred only by two tasteless in-
cerpts by Rich himself.

This is a good album for some-
one who is only tangentially inter-
ested in the music of Buddy Rich.
His more enthusiastic fans should
get the originals.

Dizzy Gillespie~Cornucopiii
(Solid State SS 18061): Dizzy
Gillespie, the man who, along
with Charlie Parker, revolu-
tionized jazz, has come a long way
in many different directions. in
this album he is in a setting of
largely over-heard, over-used and
over-rated songs, and the struggle
between the good and the ugly is
sometimes interesting. Dim
Sebesky's inconsistent arranging
makes the nlhum equally inconsis-
tent.

Conflict In Sound

by Bill hrina

FSTVL 71 [University Band Concert
Two branchesof "serious" music
fleXed their muscles at Albany
State this weekend. with decided-
ly mixed results. Friday night
Fstvl 71, a potpourri of electronic
music, presented Sal Martirano’s
L‘s G.A. (Lincoln‘s Gettysburg
Address), with films by Ronald
Nameth, preceded by Michael
Holloway reading some of his
poetry. Holloway was entertaining
and amusing in a kind of befud-
dledway, a Richard Bruutigan-type
with a certain flair and charm but
sadly lacking in Brautigan’s child-
like whimsicality and altogether
too contrived. L‘s G.A. was more

notable for the films accompany-
ing the score than for the score
itself. While Holloway stood on-
stage as the gas-masked politieo
two simultaneous 18 mm projec-
tors flashed varying slides and
projections while a third showed a
representaiton of the politico, still
gas-masked, in various swooping
poses of power. The presentaiton
seemed to be an indictment of
war, politicians. and the like. L's
G.A. was oddly moving and
powerful at times but tended to
fall into cliched and stereotyped
statements too often. The finale
was incongruous—a pastoral scene
portrayed on film, the politico
lying deadl?), and a snatch of

Pierre Virtuoso
Performs Tonight

Monday, March 15. 1971 is the
date set for the appearance of the
famous piano virtuoso, Frederic
Rzewski. Considered one of the
foremost figures of the nvant-
gurde, Rzewski has successfully
performed his music before the
audiences of the major cities of
Europe and America. He has been
heralded as "One of the few pinn»
ists with enough tccliniciil bril-
liance to play the difficult scores
of modern composers.“

Spanish Note

The Spanish 321 class of Dr.
EA. Riggio will present a drama-
tic reading of "El Auto de la
Sibilii Czisandru" by Gil Vicente.
The play concerns itself with the
shephcrdcssprophetess Cassandra
who refuses to marry because she
believes herself destined to be the
virgin mother of the Christ Child.
The actual Nativity then takes
place, and it much humbled Cus-
sundrii asks forgiveness and joins
in adoration of the Virgin and
Child.

Although the play itself is basic-
iilly u fifteenth ccntury “instruc-
tional" religious pliiy, it contains
numerous comic elements, illld
has been updated through the
addition of modern music for the
original songs.

The llziuto" will tiikc place at.
7:30 p.m. in HU 30. Admission is
free and all are welcome.

A composer and teacher, he is
also a founder of M.E.V. (Musica
Electronica Viva). He has been a
Fulbright, Rockefeller. and
Fromm Foundation fellow. and
Ford Foundation composer-
in-rcsidence in Berlin. His com-
positions include over 20 pieces.
He has recorded for RCA ltulinnu,
Polydor, Mainstream, BYG Re-
cords, Wcrgo, lllld Deutschc Grum-
ophon Gesscllschiift. He has been
ii guest artist at the music festivals
of Venice, Avignon, Berlin, Paris,
Warsaw, Madrid and other cities
on the continent. Also to his
credit belong premier perform-
iinccs of works by the notable
composers Stockhausen, Chiari
and others.

His concert here will include:
Boulcz' “Second Soniita'ban ex-
tremely fine example of serial
technique; Chiari‘s “Moonlight
Sonata"—ii piecc incorporating
Beethoven's work (first move-
ment) of the same name plus
some highly creiitiVe additions;
and il piece by the artist himself,
“Dreams” written in [961.

The concert will begin at 8:30
p.m. in the Recital Hall of the
PAC. This concert is being pre-
sented under the auspices of Mu-
sic Council and is funded by
Student Tux. Admission is $3.00
or $1.00 with a tax card.

The next cvont of FS'I‘VL '71 is
a concert by NMCE lll, directed
by Kenneth Guburo, on March 17
in the Art Gallery iit 8:30 p.m.

strings rising and swelling (re-
member “Victory at Sea"???) to
the level where the volume be-
came painful to the human ear.
Multimedia as an art form has
enormous potentiality, but this
program seemed more to play
with than to seriously develop
that potential.

Later. In the Art Gallery, Fstvl
71 presented Sal Martirano on the
Mar-Vii construction. a new
synthesizer-type instrument de-
signed by'Martirano and James
Divilbiss, an engineer. The instru-
ment is fascinating—eight octaves
are split into 16ths, each tone
then controlled by a button. Be-
low eachlbutton lies a light, so
that the musician and part of the
audience can easily tell which
tones are "on". a digital computer
“remembers” the patterns that
were played and imposes on what
the composer plays a "logic" from
these patterns. Confused? The
construction itself was booked in-
to 25 speakers, enabling the
sounds to dancE and slide around
and about the room. Altogether,
it's a fascinating instrument of
limitless potential. Unfortunately,
Mﬂfiil‘nlio's performance was
limited to low-energy, low-volume
beeps, bubbles. and sonic dood-
lings, while oscilloscope tracing
slides flickered on the ceiling.
With total concentration one
might have been able to get into
the music. but the audience quick-
ly lost all semblance of attention
and began to converse, wander
about, promenade, and so forth.
At that juncture the performance
lost all coherence,

Saturday the University Concert
Band and Wind Ensemble filled
the PAC to overflow for what
proved to be, overall, a perfor-
munce of much grace and com-
petuncc. My only quibble with the
performance was the choice of
selections from “Man of La
Manchu" to close the program.
'l‘hut seemed to be a gesture to
placate the kind of audience that
attends classical concerts not out
of any understanding or love for
the music, but because that's what
you‘re supposed to do if you want
to be considered "cultured", if
you know what i mean? After
playing music demanding a high
level of skill and competence, and
receiving polite applause at best, i
wonder what the musicians fe it
like when the “La Manchu” sel-
cctions received thunderous ap-
pluuse.
