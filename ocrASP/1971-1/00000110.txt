incredible results with such a li-
mited voice.

People who judge Melanie solely
on her recordings are bound to
underrate the troubadour. On re-
cord, her voice can be raspy and
irritating. in person, Melanie’s
effervescent personality and over-
all stage performance overcomes
whatever limitations she has. An
aura seemed to hover about her
and the audience could im«
mediately empathize with her
songs as she obviously deeply felt
what she sang. What other native
born New Yorker could make
“Carolina On My Mind" sound so
sincere.

Melanie had the audience in the
palm of hcr hand. Her fans re-
mained breath-taking silent until
the last note of each song, afraid
of missing even one breath-taking
word. 4

Whether cryitig out for justice
(“Pence Will Come"), singing
about the joys of ciiting iinimiil
crackers or thc absurdity of
Freudian psychology, she iivoids
any form of ctimmercinlity in her
songs. Following the advice of ti
Phil Oclis song shc played: “if
you want to keep your song/
Don't play thc chords of fame."
Arid its shc rcltitcd lnlcr iii
"Tuning My Guitar," she has not
forgotten that she oncr.I played
only for futi. Another major
theme seemed to be expressed in
her first cncorc, “Close To it
All": “'l‘ciir down your own little
wall/ Thiit keeps you from being ll
part of it all.“

The most moving moment for
me Wits tlic stirring version of the
Stoncs' "Ruby 'I‘uesdiiy," il pcr‘
fcct example of how to suc-
ccssfully interpret a song.

Among the songs she played
from her new album "The Good
Book," the two that stood out
were “Sign iii the Window," Miss
Sitfltii's variation on Dylan's
“Maggie's Farm" and “The Nickc
Song." The former dcscribcs hiclll'
nic's vision into the future while

the latter bcrtitcs out nation's
leaders for inaction
Between songs, the audience

would call up requests for their
favorite songs, and Mtilanic, the
female John [3. Sebastian. was
gliid to oblige them, almost en-
tircly completing her rcpctolru.

Alex Taylor Joins Brothers-
"Iiastals" Maintain Performance

by Jeff Burger

Those of you who may haVe
seen the extensive piece in a re-
cent Rolling Stone on the Taylor
family, will not be surprised at the
emergence of yet another talented
family member. Alex, who joins
brother Livingston and James,
will, in fact, soon be followed by
sister Kate, and maybe then by
brother Hugh. Supposedly, it will
end there, unless, perhaps, their
father should hook up to a guitar
and start singing.

Amazingly, James’ brothers and
sister are not merely cashing in on
his success; they are all quite good
in their own right. Alex possesses
a voice which is almost identical
to James’ and Liv's; though the
three are distinguishable, they are
still phenomenally similar.

Alex's LP is a fine country rock
recording, which differs from
James‘ work in that it is more
down home, reminiscent of the
Band. It is perhaps less tense: the
emphasis is not on the words but
with the music, having fun with
the music. This may be due to the
fact that Alex is not yet writing
his own material. Here he does
only the vocals, but the word is
that he's about to get into song-
writing and learn the piano.

Anyway, Alex’s album contains
two of his brother James’ tunes,
the new “Highway Song" and
“Night Owl," which appears in an
even stronger version than Jamcs'
original. (James plays guitar on
this version.) Also here, is an
unusual interpretation of the
Stones' “it's All Over Now." The

six other cuts, which feature such
sidemen as Greg Reeves and King
Curtis are all uniformly well done,
with a pleasant country flavor.
And, as an extra bonus, there is a
picture of Alex's young son,
James Richmond Taylor, known
to the world through a James
Taylor song as Sweet Baby James.

SEARCH AND NEARNESS, The
Rascals (Atlantic SD 8276).

It's been a long time from
"Good Lovin'” to "Right On,”
which is the first cut on the new
Rascals album, a good five years.
Compared, however, to the
changes in the music of, say, Bob
Dylan, the Rascals have remained
substantially what they were. Oh,
sure, there is the jazz influenced
(and mostly imitative) “Nana.”
Sure, some of the lyrics are chan-
ged, but basically this album
could have been released just be-
fore or after the Groouin' LP and
we’d never know the difference.

Which is not to say that it isn't
good; it is. I like it all, with one or
two tiny exceptions. (For ex-
ample, their version of “The Let-
ter" is rather lifeless and dull.)
For the most part, though, the
album is fun to listen to, es-
pecially when the lyrics are most
compatible to the music as on
"Almost Home.” This song is into
the musician-on-the ~road bummer
(like Tom Rush's “Wrong End of
the Rainbow" and James Taylor's
“Highway Song“). “Almost
Home" is it beautiful song, per-
haps the best thing on ii very
pleasant, if unimportant album.

.Mass Misunderstvandings

 

 

by Robert Verini

1 am not ti student of history, so,
it is impossible for me to com-‘,
ment on the historical accuracy of
'CROMWELL, now playing at the
Fox Colonic Theatre. It may be
that it is as good it depiction of
the struggle between the Puritan
Roundhcads and the Cavaliers of
King Charles 1 in the seventeenth
century as can be found (although
I have my doubts).

Viewing it solely as a film, how-
ever, it is sorely lacking. There are
a few isolated moments of tension
and reality here and there, but on
the whole tltc film is it series of
flat tableaux, peopled by curd-
bourd characters and dramatically

empty.

The Ken
Hughcs (whose last effort was the
far more litcriitc “Chitty Chitty
Bang Bang") is the miijor Weillt‘
ticss. CROMWELL is that type of
whose writer,

script, by director

historical movic
stinicwhtit awed by the fact that
ho is writng tiiiiloguc for "Great
Men of l'lisliiry," fchs he must
cndow lll(' script willi grand vcrhi’
zigc bcl'illing tlic pcrsoiingcs iti-
vnlvctl. Consequently, characters
ilt'l‘ l'tircvcr giving spccchcs to each
other, prefaced often by cxplc-

tives such as "In the name of
lGodL" rather than making conver-
sation. Thus we are prevented
from ever looking at the protagon-
ists as flesh-and-blood human be-
ings, but rather they strike us as
textbook figures mouthing hollow
platitudes. Furthermore, character
motivations constantly shift with-
outtexplanation, so it is impossible
to view the film with tiny clear-cut
idea of what makes each character
tick, blocking character develop-
ment, adding to our bewilderment
and making us feel even more
distant from the proceedings.

None of this is helped any by
Richard l-liirris’ performance in
the title role. l-lis Cromwell is il
simple zciiiot, whose ideas on
bringing dcmocnriicy to England
are firmly sct iii his own mind,
but whose frustration stems from
the fact that everyone kccps mis-
understanding him. This seems
likc ii rciisonitblc enough interpret.
iitioii. Unfortunately, l'llll‘l‘lﬁ' way
of communicating this is by end-
lcss, noisy lirutlcs on government
dclivcrcd without looking ill'ly of
his fellow actors in the cyc. i can't
lcll you how annoying it is when
thel hero of ii filtii stiircs out tit
spiicc its if he were posing for it
coin for two-iitid-ii-hiilf hours. Eye

contact with the person one
speaks to is one of the most basic
principles taught to beginning act-
ors, and Harris neglects it shame’
fully. it is only through the sheer
force of his presence that we feel
anything for the character at all.

Alec Guinness, playing the ele-
gant, stuttering King, also chooses
to stare out at God-knows-what
much of the time; but when he
speaks it is to someone, and his
wry, witty delivery provokes some
belief in the character. This is
certainly not one of Guinness'
better performances, but it is his
first screen appearance in many
years, and his contribution to
CROMWELL is more than wel-
come.

A number of fine actors-Robert
Morley, Dorothy Tutin, Frank
Finlay-- are wasted in poor roles.
The music score (nominated for
iin Oscar) is miserable, resorting to
cheap riffs and fiinfttrcs ii In Mtiu-
ricc Jarre rather than any kind of
musical ingenuity. The sets and
costumes look authentic enough;
iii utiy case they are very pretty.

The sort of cliciipjack history we
get in CROMWELL docs ii dis-
service to the people it portrays
and the people who pay to see it.
