Issue Once More

SYRACUSE N.Y. (AP)- Renewed talk of severing
New York City from the rest of the state was hem-d
over the weekend as a group of disgruntled taX>
payers demanded that the legislature cut back on
state spending.

The group of about 500. who call themselves
“Taxpayers in Revolt," met late Sunday with four
area legislators. Mrs. Joyce Bygali, a suburban
housewife who organized the group, presented a list
of 10 demands she said should be acted on
immedicateiy.

New York City should be made a separate state,
she told the legislators. She also demanded that
revenue sharing be rejected.

"We have.to keep the pressure on all the state
representatives," she told the group after they
agreed to support an effort to cut Gov. Rocke-
't‘eller's budget by at least $1.3 billion.

"We pay their salaries and we tell them what to
do," she added.

She added the following eight demands:

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS"

0f N. Y.C.

-An end to political appointments to the jobs of
commissioner of the state departments of Mental
Health, Education, Social Services and the Board of
Social Services.

-At least three to four weeks public notice before
a vote on bills.

-Cuts in legislative salaries, Iqus and benefits.

-The end of the so-called “midnight” budgets.

-Repeal of state-mandated spending in education
and welfare.

-An investigation of the state Ofﬁce of General
Services.

-The outlawing of special
Albany.

Mrs. Bygall also outlined a tgsk for the “tnxfree
Rockefeller Foundation." She said the group de-
manded an end to the spending of the taxpayers'
money on the $1. billion Albany South Mall project
and suggested the foundation pick up the constr-
uction costs.
