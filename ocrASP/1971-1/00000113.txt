Benezet Cites Effect
Of State Budget Cut

by Tracy Egan

President Benezet discussed the effect of Governor
Rockefeller's budget cut on the State University
system at his bi-monthly press conference Tuesday.

At his forum, Benezet said that approximately
$3.4 million is being cut from the appropriations for
State Universities. A large percentage of the new
budget will be used just to make up mandated salary
increases for the stuff. Due to the current budget
freeze, positions vacated by faculty and staff will
often remain unfilled. Therefore the size of the
average class will be notably increased. The Educa-
tional Opportunity Program will also be hllrt by the
cut. Next year the EOP was sltited for u growth of
30-40% from its present size. Currently it is not
scheduled for growth.

Benezcl. predicts ll rc-thinking of the projected
enrollment for the University. Because of a general
freeze of educational funds it will be Virtually
impossible to meet the demands of projected
growth and still maintain a high quality of educzu
tion. Benezet, recalling the budget cuts, said "There
is a curious illusion in the public that everybody
has a right to higher cducution."And yet "we
cannot administer to more and more people for less
and less money."

Several departments will be having classes off the
Podium next year. Due to (Wet-crowded conditions,
the University is going to rent the Picotte building.
Tile Computer Science and Economics departments,
and the Schools of Criminal Justice and Library
Science are all slated for the moVe.

An improtnptu discussion of the S-U grading
system was part. of the President's Forum. The
general conccrisus of the students present was that
the pass-fail system provides little incentive and
makes it virtually impossible to transfer to other
schools. Although a passvl‘uil system may be ideal-
isticaliy preferable, a return to the letter grade
system is desired by many.
