Save the Earth

Action to save the earth from humanity has
been unbelievably slow, despite the increasing
ecological disasters. People are eternally optim—
istic—no one seems to realize the immediacy of
the problem.

The last—the very last—to comprehend our
problems seem to be our elected representa-
tives in Albany and Washington. At last,
however, the House of Representatives has
denied further funding to the SST, the ulti-
mate folly of our age. At last, the State
Assembly (or at least one of its committees) is
considering a bill to force the use of recycled
papers. These incredibly late measures are still
not law, however, and neither body seetns to
be in any rush to deal with them.

The University Community can, in some
ways, act every bit as deaf as the legislators.
Requests to write to lawmakers are ignored,
recycling drives fail (though usually due to
lack of a market for what’s recycled), and
people still waste incredible amounts of paper
cups, napkins, water, electricity, and other
items.

“Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness“
stops short ofallowing one to shout “Fire!” in
a crowded theatre. it is time people started
considering the overuse of “disposables” as a
private criminal act. The Bill of Rights does
not include the Freedom to Pollutc. Remem-
ber that the next time you eat dinner.

And for your own sake, do something to
awaken the rest of the world to man‘s last and
greatest threat: himself.

Student Struggle

Open Letter to the
University Community:

Thursday, March 11 there was
bloodshed at the university of
Pucrto Rico in Rio Piedras.

The events at Rio Piedras which
involved the issue of R.O.T.C. ON
CAMPUS, have been a long time
in coming. in the last few years
the Puerto Rican University stu-
dents have struggled with all
methods possible, against the
existence of a branch of the
United States armed forces, the
R.O.T.C., on Puerto Rican Univer-
sity campuses.

Below are the events of the past
few days:

~Wednesday, March 10: A
group of R.O.T.C. cadets as-
saulted a Pro-Independence stu-
dent in the University Cafeteria.

—'I‘hursday, March 11: A group
of R.O.T.C. cadets armed with
pipes and torches, entered the
University Campus Center, as-
saulted several Pro-Independence
students, one of which was
wounded by a bullet. After having
committed the criminal act they
sought refuge in the R.O.T.C.
building. The R.O.T.C. building
was immediately surrounded by
protesters. Various incidents oc-
curred, and the University chan-
cellor gave riot police permission
to enter the University, with the
knowledge that. on numerous pre-
vious cecasions these forces have
brutally attacked Pro-Indepen-
dence students. As expected, the
students defended themselves.
The results: two police officers
and one R.O.T.C. cadet. dead.

Act For Ecology

To the Editor:

A genuine concern for the en-
vironment involves a genuine wil-
lingness to back up words with
action. in New York State a De-
pnrlmcnl of Environmental (,‘on-
st-rvution was established last year.
It is the only government agency
available for action on environ-
mental problems in the slate.

Rockefeller's budget severely ro-
dueotl the budget. of the DEC. The
Ways and Means Committee of
the NYS Assembly is now propon-

ing an effective further out of
$4.7 million after mandated in-
creases are removed. These cuts, if
allowed to remain, will severely
inhibit the enforcement capability
of the DEC. Legal action by the
DEC against polluters will be
greatly curtailed by disallowing
the eight new attorney positions
urgently needed. Environmental
field services such as testing and
detection will be curtailed. On-
going projects on solid waste
problems will be set. back by
eliminating $100,000 to develop
model regional sanitary landfill
projects.

In the area of management, the
number of conservation officers in
the field will be reduced by 20
percent. The Forest Practice Act
program will be eliminated.

It is time the legislators stopped

this time the NYS Assembly has
to set some priorities straight.

Unjust FSA
To the Editor:

This is a reply to the editorial of
March 5, dealing with the disullot-
menl of board as payment to
Residence Stuff. I would have
replied to the editor's comments
earlier but i knew FSA was deli~
berating on this issue, and 1 de-
cided lo wait for their decision.
Maybe this wasn't too wise. On
Friday, March 12, all Resident
Assistants were informed that
next ycur their board will be cut
down from 20 meals/wk to 7
meals/wk.

This cut in salary is not just.
Ever since last May, when ll.A.'s
and Directors had to take shifts
for the lasts 2 Weeks of the your
to keep the Quads safe from fire
bombera,the responsibilities of the
job have increased. 'l'hefth’ have
doubled, bomd- scares are be-
coming popular, and vandalism
(especially to vending machines
and elevators) has increased. With
the situation the way ii iii now in

Vietnam, who knows what is
going to happen this May? The
Residence Staff, now faced with
all these new responsibilities, and
with no evidence to show that the
situation will improve next. year,
is hit. with a pay cut. SomehoW,
the logic of this maneuver eludes
me.

The editor of this paper claims
that the money taken from Resi-
dence staff will help relieve FSA‘s
deficit. Isn't. this avoiding the real
problem? Isn't FSA merely fol-
lowing the path of least resis-
tnnce? Sure, who‘s going to hitch
now— the one hundred or so
R.A.'s who have jobs for next
year? In a university of 10 or l2
thousand, that's not too many
people. But, we are avoiding the
actual reason for FSA‘s deficit.

Now let’s take a look at FSA's
Bookstore. This store has a mono-
poly on this campus, and its prices
are as high as if not. higher titan
most stores off-campus , yel , ll
consistently operates at a deficit.
It seems to me thal there is a
problem of gross mismanagement
here. What. is needed is obviously
not a cut. in Residence staff sal-
aries, but a complete overhauling
of the operation and management
of the Bookstore and FSA itself.
Until this is accepted, more
people working in the university
will see money and services which
they normally receive from FSA
cut. Who's next?

Madness Makes McCloud

by Tom Quigley

l BREWSTER MeCLOUD is sheer
compOUnded madness from the
makers of M‘A'S‘H that contin-
ues the tradition of Verbal and
visual assault made popular by the
landmark war satire. Director
Robert Altman, writer Doran Wil»
liam Canon and practically the
entire cast and crew from
M*A*S*H‘ have combined to fer-
ociously attack everything from
ecology, kinky sex, moral and
physical pollution, to modern un-
orthodox police methods and
“glamorous” Hollywood films.

try" and it too is an excellent
performance, as is Mose Allison’s
expressivo “Fool Killer." This
Canadian group should go places.

Another group from the north is
The Bells. Their album Fly Little
White Dove Fly (Polydor
24-4510) is a dull affair. Their
harmonies are common and their
songs sound better as played by
their original performers - “Proud
Mary," “Rain,” etc.

The Amboy Dukes play some
very satisfying and inspired music
on Survival of the Fittest (Polydor
24-4035). Ted Nugenl. is all over
his guitar, spitting out notes like
ﬂames from a red hot. furnace.
The 21 minute "Prodigal Man" is
well sustained throughout the
whole performance. Organist
Andy Solomon begins with a
quote from the MJQ song “Bug‘s
Groovo" and builds to a strong
crescendo. The sound leaves a bit
to be desired, but. the music itself
more than makes up for that.

Mountain has the capability of
taking a listenable lune like
“Don't Look Around" spice it
with the juices of emotion and
end up with a highly potent pro-
duct. This is certainly what http~
pens on their Nantucket Sleigh-
ride (Windfall 5500) album. The
lead singer has a strong husky
voice, and the guitar is full, the
bass appropriately responsive to
all moods. And the moods are
varied, so that dull moments are
rare. The drummer gets a nice
sound out of his lrups, but is not.
all that inventive. On the whole a
very good album.

Fever Tree's For Sale (Ampcx
A-l()l 13) is so typical of rock in
general that it offers no new
experiences at all. All the tnusi~
Clans are competent. “Hey Joe"
takes up all of side two and this is
too much for the musieul lalcnts
involved. As a result even lhe
slrcngth of the melody tlwindles
and then it. is mostly it case study
in repetition.

Melting Pot's It'irc burn, (‘ttul-
tlrort Iluhblc (Ampcx 1()l ii) is
another one of those rock with
brass albums. The tIptcmpo“Kool
and the Gang“ sounds like a Bud
dy llich Clutrt...craekling, punchy
trombone!rumch attack, gralui-
Ions tenor solo. All charts are
inlcresling. Trumpeter Paul llmur»
ovich gets off it good solo on "As
1 Lay Dying" and Steve Nichols
has it good time with “Feeling
Alright" on trombone. Except for
the wretched vocals this group
matches up to BSA’L'I' slundurtls.

It'rcsh llut'r

Canon's seatologlenl script in ba-
sically concerned with the free-
dom of spirit that. man fut,in
attempts to achieve, symbolized
by Brewster final ﬂight. The ear
ruption and compromise of the
innocent, who attempts to “rise
above" earthly woes and human
corruptions, is the ambitious
theme and the tragedy of BREW-
STER McCLOUD.

Brewster, a pasty-face, goggle-
eyed Icarus, entertains the idea of
making a solo flight with a pair of
mechanical wings. He hatches his
schemes in the bomb shelter of
the Houston Astrodome with the
aid and protection of Louise, an
erotic guardian angel gone bad.

Brewster is pursued and ulti-
mately brutalized by the forces of
insensitivity and opportunism but.
not before he is able to make his
ill-fated flight. The metaphor, of
the Astrodome acting like a cage,
confines our hero to an earth-
bound existence. Man was not
built to fly and the message is
Poignnntly illustrated in this brill-
iant and heartbreaking cinematic
moment.

Those who front. for morality
and goodness (social and politi-
cal), and who usually know no-
thing about either, have stamped
the stigma of social taboo upon
that. mode of self-expression and
love. Therefore Brewster, the eter-
nal innocent is doomed by this
ambivalent innocent-corruption
syndrome from the beginning.

He becomes the avenger of so-
eial justice by destroying the pow-

erful ecology disrupting unti-
humaniutlc types after having
them marked for murder by bird
droppings from the sky. His final
corruption takes place at the
hands of an incredible looking,
eternal teeny-hopper who intro-
duces him into the pleasures of
human "flight" and ultimately
uses that moment of trust to
betray him.

Altman and Canon have packed
this film with so much visual and
oral detail that it might take the
average viewer two showings to
sort it all out. This entire collage
of maddness somehow knits toge-
ther into a pungent and merciless
satire on the self-destructive ten-
dencies of the human animal.

Bud Cort is just as limp and
emaciated as he was in M‘A‘S’H
but does a fine job as the bewil-
dered Brewster. Sally Kellerman
does the best she can with a do
nothing role as Louise. It. is Mich-
ael Murphy as super-cop Frank
Shaft, John Schuck as his bum-
bling assistant, and Stacy Keaeh as
dastardly old, Abraham Wright
who turn in the superb comic
performances. BREWSTER
MeCLOUD is both subtle and
blunt. in its implications as to the
fate of the human race. It is, in
the greatest sense, an anti-
pollution film that. not only ques-
tions the dubious exploitation of
our natural resources but, indeed,
gives a sharp and painful look at
the pollution of human values and
the degradation of the human
spirit.

The Carpenters, brother ttnd sis-

Grammy was for their recording

Flip Wilson's "The Devil Made

the best comedy recording.

might. make one think this is an
ordinary blowing session. The re-
sults, however, are anything but
ordinary.

An album with Zoot Sims has

been long in coming, but. this
effort was worth the wait. Sims is
in an unusual setting here; al-
though standard tunes have often
been his forte his adaptability is
very evident here - l have rarely
heard him in better form. His
timing is us magical as ever and his
beautiful tone is well projected,
although slightly thicker than usu-
al.
Although Adm is highly respected
l have never realized his true
ability before hearing this album.
His ballads are played skillfully
and the contrast between his
rough sound and the pretty songs
is often touching. His forceful
uptempo playing is packed with
ideas as well as being technically
difficult.

Elvin Jones rarely fails and he
plays as well as ever here. His
ttppronCh to time keeping is the
most individual of all drummers,
but his personal stamp is most
obvious during the exchanges of
“burnout” and his solo in “Veran-
(li" ~ a complicated mnlunge of
drum crescendos, bass drum ae-
t'L‘IllN, und eymbttl splashes - all
furious and energetic.

Solos by Flunnigun and Carter
are good, but not terribly notc-
worthy. Their rhythm section
work, howeVer, is what keeps this
fine album going from beginning
lo end.

All the songs are in u motlern
Vein, and they contain a great deal
of variety both in mood and
tempo, putting the finishing
touches on it work of art pllt‘
excellence.

Zool Sims is it great musician
who has produced superior, and
often great music for ovur 20
year. Perhaps the time is ripe for
an album of his own. But iii the
meantime all Simsopliiles should
hear this as well as all other jam
fans.
