Roommates; or Know Your Enemy

You'd think that with all the progress we've made in the educa-
tion game, somebody would have found a cure for roommates by now.
But no. Roommates remain as big a problem today as they were when
Ethan Mather founded the ﬁrst American college.

(Incidentally. despite what you've heard, Harvard was not the
first American college. Mr. Mather started his institution almost 100
years earlier. And it was quite an institution, let me tell you! Mr.
Mather built schools of liberal arts, ﬁne arts, animal dentistry and
ﬁintlock repair. He built a covered stadium for lacrosse that seated
200,000. Everywhere on campus was emblazoned the stirring Latin
motto CAVE MUSSI—“Wateh out for moose." The student union
contained four bowling alleys, 21 horoscope machines and a 97-chair
barbershop.

(It was the barbershop, alas, that brought Mr. Mather’s college
to an early and total end. The student body, alas, then as now, con-
sidered haircuts an Establishment hangup, and nobody set foot in the
barbershop. The chief barber, 'I‘ruscott Follicle by name, grew so de-
pressed staring at $17 empty chairs that one day his mind ﬁnally gave
way. Seizing his vibrirtor, he ran outside and shook the entire campus
until it crumpled to rlust. This later became known as "I’ickett’s
Charge")

But I digress. We were exploring ways for you aan your roommate
to stop hating each other. This is admittedly no easy task, and yet it
is not impossible if you will both benrl 11 bit. give a little.

I remember, for example, my own college days (Berlitz, '08). My
roommate was, I think you will allow, even less agreeable than most.
He was a Tibetan named Ringriding whose native customs, while irr-
disputably colorful, were not entirely endearing. Mark you, I didn't
mind so much the gong he struck on the hour or the string of tire-
crackers he ignited on the half-hour. I didn't even mind that ho singed
chicken feathers during his prayers at dawn and dusk. What 1 did
mind was that he singed them iir my hat.

 

To be fair, he was not totrtlly taken with sunroof my habits either
—especially my hobby. (I collect airplane tires arrrl had, at that time,
nearly 400,000 of them in our room.)

Well sir, things grew steadily cooler Iii-tween llingading and inc,
and they might actually have rear-bed thrI breaking point had not we
each happened to receive a package from home one day. Rirrgarling
opened his package first, smiled shyly at me nnrl otlercrl me a gift.

“Thank you," I said. "What is it '.’"

“Yak butter," he said. “You put it 111 your hair. Iir Tibet we roll
it ﬁrst: are kidstrtjf.”

"Well now, that's mighty friendly," I said arrrl ollcl‘t'tl him a gift
from my package.

“Thank you," he said. "What is it?"

"A can of Miller Iliglr Life Ileer," I said.

"I will try it at once," he said uan did.

“Not bad," he said.

"It is even better when you open the can," I said nirrl showed
him how.

He consumed it forthwith, “\\'owdo\v!” he cried. “Never have I
known such mellowness, smoothness, ambcrrress and generalized
euphoria!"

"I-lave another," I said.

“Oh, I must not!" he cried. “Obviously a beverage of such splen-
dor 3 made only for riire occasions and is therefore dillicult to obtain
and costly beyond the reckoning of it."

"Ha, ha, the joke is on you," I said. "Miller Iliin Life is brewed
every single rlay by plain decent folks Just like you and mo and is avail-
able everywhere at a price well within the most modest of budgets."
“Golly,” he said. “Sort of makes it man feel humblo."

“Yes, don't It?" I said.

Then silently we clasped hands, friends iit Inst. 1 lllll proud to say
we remain friends to this day. We exchange curds each Christmas ruirl
each Fourth of July, ﬁrecrackers.

John Quattrochi To Captain '71-72 Squad

Jack Jordan Voted MVP;

Senior co-captains Jack Jordan
and Alan Reid were honored as
Albany’s Most Valuable and Most
Improved players, respectively,
for 1970-71. In winning the MVP
award for the second straight
year, Jordan led the team in sco-

ring (15.8) and rebounding (9.7)

Reid improved offensively and
defensively , and, according to his
coach, “none of my players ever
had as many clean steals.” Reid
upped his scoring average from
10.0 to 11.7 and his field goal

Sauersmen Select

Toughest Opponent

Gene “The Machine" Mumford,
whose 34 points were the most
scored against, the Great Danes
this season, is a unanimous selec-
tion of the State University at
Albany basketball players to their
1970-71 All-Opponent Team.
Joining the 6-3 University of
Scranton star on the squad are 6-3
Randy Smith and 6-6 Durie Burns
of Buffalo State, Hartwick’s 6-1
Willie Rackley, and 6-2 Fred
Shear of Siena. Burns, a junior,
and Shear, a sophomore, are the
only underclassmen.

Mumford's point explosion was-
n't enough to prevent a 72-69
Albany victory over Scranton for
third place in the Pocono Classic
in early January. The previous
evening, however, Smith and

Burns had led Buffalo State to a
60-53 comeback triumph to

knock the Danes into the consola-

tion bracket. Smith, a pro pros-
pect at guard, scored 17 and
Burns added 13, while controlling
the boards.

Rackley tallied 21 against AI-
bany, but the Danes handed Hart-
wick its only home loss of the
season, 7066. Shear’s 17 points
were the only bright spot for
Siena, an 85-70 victim in the
annual rivalry, The suph star set ii
season scoring record this your at
Sienn, as (lid Riicklcy irt I'Iartwick.
Mumford and Smith already hold
their sclrouls‘ mark.

None of this year‘s selections is
ii repeater from last season's team.

I I Matmen Fall
In Nationals

The four State University at
Albany wrestlers who competed
in the NCAA College Division
Championships at North Dakota
State University all lost first
round matches. Coach Joe Garcia
noted that there was it two and
one-half week lay-off between A1-
bany's last dual mulch and the
tournament. The team was sche-
duled to take part in the New
York State Championships in Ro-
chcstor the previous weekend, bttt
a snowstorm prevented it from
making the trip.

The Albany entrants in the
1150-inarr NCAA field were sopho-
more 112 pnundor Jeff Albrecht,
0-11 in dual matches this season;
junior 150 poundor Jim
Niglrtingrilc, 6-11; sophomore 1138
pourrder Phil Mimn, 9-0-2; aird
senior 190 poundcr ’I‘im Coon,
1(1-1. The Ditties enjoyed 119-2
season, their best ever.

Albany‘s Synchronized Swim
Club is hoping for a good show-
ing. At the EISSC Stunt Compe-
tition held at Mount Holyoke this
past November the team came
home with the first place trophy,
and so they should certainly be
counted in the running for the top
prize on Saturday. Albany will be
entering four groups; a Beginner
Group (Denny Goldberg, Judy
Johnson, Irene Skidmore, Bev
Schmidt, Peggy Dalhcim, Gloria
Neward, Margaret Reiley, and
Carol Mann (sub)); two Interme-
diate Duets (Jackie Levy and Deb-
by Swalm; Meg Hahne and Sandy
Grail); and an Advanced Solo
(Marueen Malling). At the Stunt
Competition in November, Denny
Goldbert took a first in the Begin-
ning Group and Murucen Melling
swam home with the first prize
trophy in the Advanced Group.

The Advanced Solo competition
should be it most interesting
event, as Maureen will be compe-
ting against her former AAU duet
partner Sue Smeder, winner of the
Advirnced Competition last year.

Miss Gilliird, a sophomore (liver

unit and Miss Gilliird narrowly

mendously this year, winning all

tions irt the women's meets this
