Living Next Year at SUNYA
Will Offer New Experiences

by Andy Schirn

The curtain goes up today on “Live-In 1971-72“ as it begins a traditional spring engagement. on the
SUNY circuit. Opening off-Broadway, way off Broadway, in Albany, this year‘s production, directed by
Charles Fisher, promises to house a cast of thousands. Making their premiere appearances are several
special programs including one entitled “Four Plus Two," not. to be mistaken for “Three in the Attic."
This one will be rated M, for mature audiences only.

The ASP, realizing that many students are not familiar with the script, now presents this sneak preview.
This is only meant to be a brief critique. For complete details see the Housing Brochure, available in all
residence halls and the main box office, 103 Fulton Hall, State Quadrangle, better known as the Housing
Office.

The scene opens with a panoramic shot of the entire campus. You may have already guessed that this is
shown in black and white, what else? To familiarize each student with what the individual quads have to
offer, we zoom in, first to Dutch Quad.

Schuyler Hall will house men and women under the same roof in an alternate suite setup. There will be
no freshmen, no priorities according to class, and students returning to live in Schuyler will not have
priority.

The Spanish section of Schuyler will also be coeducational. A basic interest and knowledge in Espanol.
to be determined in interviews by a committee of students oresentlv living in the dorm,ls requiredPanninz
over to Colonial Quad, contrary to previous publicity, Paine Hall will continue to be a female
residence facility. Both Paine and Livingston Tower applied to the Committee on Student Residences to
become coed. As more interaction is possible in low rises, Paine was the first selection. However, the
women residing there now, upon learning they had no priority to return, passed up the chance.
The action now moves up to the top four floors (18-21) of Livingston
Tower, which Will house men and women in alternate suites. Standard

Scale and Huggins ~ ' ‘ . 
Panther TrialE'fOpe

by Peter Coven
Associated Preu writer, ,

The prosecution called a surprise witneu to start , '
its case against Black Panther national Chairman ‘ 3'-
Bobby G. Scale and Ericka Huggins today.

State’s Attorney Arnold Markle called Margaret
Hudgine, a one-time defendant in the Panther
slaying case who testified for the defense in an earlier
trial.

Catherine Roraback, attorney for Mrs. Huggins,
called the action "a grandstand play by Mr. Markle
to start this trial off with a lot of headlines." She
said Mrs. Hudgins came to the courthouse as a
spectator and was subpoenaed a half hour before
the start of the trial.

Scale and Mrs. Huggins face capital charges in
connection with the May 1969 slaying of Alex
Rackiey, another Panther. Mrs. Hudgins faced simi-
lar charges in the Rackley slaying, but she later was
allowed to plead guilty to the lesser charge of
aggravated assault. Her sentence was limited to time
already served.

She was a defense witness in the only other trial
which has been held in the Raekley slaying, that of
Lonnie Lucas.

When Mrs. Hudgins took the witness stand,
Judge Harold M. Mulvey asked her if she would
answer questions. She replied that she would plead
the Fifth Amendment. Markle then offered her
immunity from further prosecution, but the judge
did not not immediately on the proposal.

Mulvey granted a recess until afternoon to allow
Mrs. Hudgins to consult with an attorney.

Scale and Mrs. Huggins are charged with kid-
naping resulting in death and aiding and abetting
mutter—offenses that carry the death penalty-plus
conspiracy to kidnap and to murder. Mrs. Huggins
also is charged with binding with criminal intent.

Syracuse to Vote on ROTC

SYRACUSE, N.Y.  — Students and faculty will vote in a
campus-wide referendum March 30 on whether to retain the Army
and Air Force Reserve Ofﬁcers Training Corps programs at Syracuse
University.

The University Senate, composed of students, faculty and admin-
istrators, chose Wednesday to use the referendum to decide the
question.

Students and faculty also will vote on what. form the ROTC
programs should take if they are retained.

 

priorities will prevail, but to give all students an equal chance of being
included, returning residents to the tower will not. have priority in the
coed sections.

Looking over at State Quad, three hundred spaces, making up the ~
top fourteen floors of Eastman Tower will be available for coed y
residence. Present occupants have no priority. Should they be unable
to gain entrance because of low priority into coed Eastman Tower,
they will be given a returning-to-building priority in the first available
female hall of their choice.

The remaining one hundred spaces in the tower are being held for
male and female transfers and freshmen. The floors will be staggered
in twoiloor units of males and females.

Melville-Steinmetz will continue to be a coeducation experience
housing male and female participants in alternate suites. Priority here
is senior, sophomore, junior.

Meanwhile, on the muddy terrain of Indian Quad, Oneida and
Onondaga Halls will house a special program entitled “Four Plus
Two." In concept, each resident in these halls will share with staff and
fellow'residents some part of the responsibility for the functioning of
this community experience. Preferences will be given first to
sophomores, then juniors, then seniors for this coed arrangement of
alternating floors.

Adirondack and Tuscarora Halls have been selected to house
students interested in studies related to the environment. Incidentally,
Mohawk Tower will not. be ready for September occupancy, but. the
dining hall is expected to be completed.

Not to overlook Alumni Quad, Waterbury, Alden and Sayles Halls
all will remain coed by floors.

The following involve some audience participntion. Act I is to obtain
an application for on-cnmpus housing, available in all residenCe hulls.
Students currently living off-campus, who wish to apply, may pick up
an application in the Housing Office.

Act. II consists of completing the application and returning it plus a
$25 deposit to the State Quad Flagroom on the days April 12 through
l6. Students planning to live together in a room or suite must. turn in
their completed contract. cards together. No application will be
accepted unless all studean in the group are present to have their
Food Service picture taken.

Following a short intermission, students will be notified of hall
assignments during the week of April 26-30. A general informational
meeting will be held in each residence hall between May 3-7 to select
rooms.

’l‘lit-ro are :I,ll~l choice locations availabiet for continuing under-
gratluall-t students. Continuing graduate studctns will have 270
availahlc Spaces. Presently, it (loos not appear that increased occu-
pancy will be necessary. ‘ I '

Remember to check the Housing Brochure for complete listings and
detailed information on all of the nbovu procedures.
