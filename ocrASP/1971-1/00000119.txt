GRAND JURIES PROBE MALL

A four-month-old Albany Grand Jury ‘ended its term this week
without handing in any official report about the South Mall. There
were widespread reports the panel was investigating alleged loun-
sharking, price padding, missing materials and other infractions.

Two other panels are also investigating the Mall. Grand juries in
Auburn and Utica are presently probing the Mall and may be using
information passed on from the Albany panel.

ALBANY AIRPORT EXPANDING

Over the objections of local Colonie county legislators, the Albany
County Legislature approved a 1500 foot extension of the east-west
runway Friday. This measure was coupled with a request for $6.2
million in federal aid. The county’s share would be $780,000. The
measure passed 26-8. I

The main grounds of the objections was that this could be part of a
plan to turn Albany Airport into a jet port and still further expansion
could result, bringing in larger, noisier aircraft more frequently.

MOHAWK STRIKE ENDS

The 128-duy-old strike of Utica-bused Mohawk Airline has been
settled! The Airline Pilot‘s Association (ALPA) and the carrier agreed
that issues still unsettled on March 25 would be submitted to binding
arbitration.

The first flights are expected on April 111 and full service will
resume by mid-May. But about 14 per cent of the pie-strike flights are
permanently cancelled by the airline.

The company recently announced that it had again gone into the
red last year. The amount of the deficit, about $11 million, was twice
the previous year’s loss. Much of the increased loss was blamed on the
crippling strike, which began in mid-November.

CAN RECYCLING CENTERS OPEN

Two tin and steel can recycling centers have opened in the Albany
area. Incuted at 10 Eric Boulevard in Albany and 6 Simmons Lune in
Menands, the centers are part of a national effort by four can
manufacturers to help the environment.

The Albany depository will be open round-the-clock; the Menands
plant ,8 to 5 every day. All size cans are accepted. Before depositing
the cans, they must be carefully washed to avoid attracting rodents,
and compacted. The easiest method of compacting is by simply
stepping on them.

The centers are run for ecological reasons only, and do not make a
profit. Scrap cans are worth $10 a ton (about 25-30 thousand cans).
The can companies involved are Continental Can 00., National Can
00., American Can 00., and the Heekin Can Co. The recycling project
is three months old nationally.

SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION

Mayor Corning filed suit with the State Supreme court this week
against the Albany County Board of Elections to change the date of
the elected school board from this November to May, 1972.The
propostion for the elected school board was passed by a 2 to 1 margin
last Novamber.

Among the reasons Mnyor Corning gnve was that the small number
of signatures needed on the nominating petition might result in an
exceedingly large number of nominations, causing a bottleneck 111. the
general electionHe also said the declining population of the city (the
1970 census shows it dipped below the 125,000 level of a major city)
changed the laws affecting the city and it was now mandatory for an
elected school board and the provisions of the recently enacted laws
didn't apply,

Ropubllmin State Senator Langley has introduced legislation to
keep Albany in the category of 11 major city (over 126,000) despite
census figures, until June 30, 1972. if his legislation passes, the school
board election will be held this November as originally proposed,
unless Corning‘s suit, wing~

MPY‘“ Corning, u Democrat, originally vigorously opposed the
RGPUincun- sponsored elected school board. He held the power of
ui’POintment of the present three-mun board. if Corning's suit
succeeds und Langley’s extension fails, the election will be held in
May. 1973.

Rocky’s Car Insurance Bill

Could Cut Rates 33-56%

Action is being taken on the
state level to initiate no-fault.
automobile insurance programs.
This new type of insurance cover-
age has the twin advantages of
reducing annual premiums and
providing faster and more equi-
table payments.

Four main plans are before the
consideration of the legislature.

The Stewart plan pushed by
Govarnor Rockefeller is the most
open-ended plan. Under its pro—
visions the victims in an auto
accident would be compensated
by the auto owner’s own insur-
ance company and the fault as-
pect of the accident would be
irrelevant, except when one of the
drivers involved is under the influ-
ence of alcohol, drugs or other
anti-social factors.

Robert J. Bertrand, Deputy
State Insurance Superintendent,
estimates that under an enacted
Stewart Plan, the average owner's
insurance cost would decrease
33% with respect to the compul-
sory coverages and a 56% cost.
decline for the typical insurance
package that includes non-mun-
dated coverage.

The basic premise of how no-
fault insurance works is that each
individual would be paid for all
their net economic losses, inclu-
ding medical and rehabilitative ex-
penses, lost income and other
related expenses, out of their dri-
vcr’s or car owner's insurance
company, except. for unusual cir-
cumstnnces.

Benefits which would result
from implementation of the plan
ure:
it would compensate the vic-
tim 100% for his losses immed-
iutely. Under the present system,
the seriously injured are compen-
sated for less than 25% of their
full economic losses. This happens
because cases drug on and on
(average victim waits 15 months
for payments) and many, in des-
peration, settle for less than they
are entitled to, out of court. Fully
45% of the seriously injured must

new lower their standard of living
while settlement cases drag on.

The delay, uncertainty and ex-
pense of proving fault would be
eliminated. Now, unless a victim
can prove the complete fault of
the other driver involved, he
stands to lose. if the driver mainly
at fault can prove some small
degree of fault on the part of the
other driver, the settlement can be
frustrated.

The civil courts would be freed
of roughly half the case burden
that now clogs them. The delays
in our present court system are
now viewed as a national shame
and scandal.

The design of safer cars would
be encouraged since those driving
unsafe cars could face higher in-
surance costs.

it would permit the consumer
to cover his special insurance
needs beyond the net economic
loss coverage.

Primary opposition to the
Rockefeller-backed Stewart plan
comes from lawyers and insurance
mam

Statistics of 1968 show in lia-
bility cases in New York State,
lawyers received one billion dol-
lars. The attorneys for those peo-
ple suing—the plaintiffs—collected
eight hundred million dollars in
fees. This equals about 35% of the
actual amount. awarded to the
accident victims.

At present about 56 cents of
every insurance dollar goes for
overhead and only 44 cents of
each dollar paid over reaches ac-
cident victims for all losses.

The New York State Bar Asso-
ciation opposes the Stewart Bill.
it supports no-fnult. insurance in
general with the stipulation that
accident victims still have the op-
portunity to seek relief in court.

The bur-supported plan is
sponsored by Senator Hughes and
Assemblyman Crawford. Under
provisions of this plan, victims
could receive up to $2,000 in
direct payments from their own
Insuruncc company, exclusive of

to (IIHt‘llHH uny

medical bills. The right to court
procedure to determine fault will
still remain. The advantages of
immediate payment and right. to
court trial for additional compen-
sation from future pain and suf-
fering, would both exist.

A third measure is sponsored
by Senator Gordon. The measure
is aimed at the claims of $400 or
less in actual medical expendi-
tures. About 75% of all auto-
mobile bodily injury claims
amount to less than this ﬁgure.

For amounts under $400, the
no-fault system would be used.
The insured would be reimbursed
under the present system for
amounts over $400. In addition,
the injured person could sue for
“pain and suffering" and be com-
pensated for up to $2,000,

Another measure is sponsored
by Assemblyman Lerner of
Queens and follows the other bills
in general in regard to no-fault
insurance. it retains a cause of
action for pain and suffering. The
bill also changes the types of
coverage different groups of peo-
ple. need.
