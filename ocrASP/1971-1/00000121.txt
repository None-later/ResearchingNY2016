Environmental Conservation

Faces Grave Financial Crisis

by mime Edelman

The newly created New York
State Department of Environ-
mental Conservation faces a grave
ﬁnancial crisis for the next fiscal
year.

Bob Buehl, the area representa-
tive of SCOPE-Student Council on
Pollution and the Environment-
spoke to an emergency meeting of
PYE Thursday night. The topic
was a familiar one—proposed bud-
get cuts, this time affecting the
Department of Environmental
Conservation. Speaking informally
to a sparse audience, Buehl out-
lined the major problems facing
the recently established depart-

the department considers to be a
minimum operating budget. This
year they operated on $38 mil-
lion. They asked for $42 million
for next year—only $400,000 of
which would go for new pro-
grams. The rest would go for
mandated salary raises. However,
the legislature will only give them
$37 million. This means not only
no new programs, but several old
ones will have to be cut.
According to Buehl, the Depart-
ment desperately needs more law-
yers. They only have 8 now to
cover the whole state. He com-
mented, “You can write all the
laws you want to but if we don't
get the manpower to back them
up they won’t be put into effet‘t."

trial smoke stack testers.

The Department, which was
created last July. was formed out
of the old Conservation Depart-
ment and parts of the Agriculture

and Health Departments. As a '

result, most of the employees are
civil service workers, who accord-
ing to Buehl, “are not very en-
vironment oriented." He added,
“We need money to increase em-
ployee ability.” However, he rates
as his biggest problem the fact
that politicians no longer consider
the environment a priority. People
must not before March 27, since
the final budget will be voted on
April 1. Buehl feels that this issue

Kappa Beta Announces
Annual Clothing Drive

Kappa Beta fraternity will begin their annual
clothing drive next week on Friday, March 26. All
clothing will be used locally and will be distributed
by the Trinity Institute in Albany's South End. The
Institute will sell the clothing for a very nominal
price. However, all the money earned from the sale
of clothing is used to further other programs of the
Institute such as a day care center for working
mothers, adult workshops, etc.

Kappa Beta is asking the University community to
donate all old but usable clothing to this worthy
cause. They're particularly interested in children's
clothing but adult clothing and shoes are also
desperately needed. The drive closes Friday, April 2.
Collection boxes are located in the lower lourgcs of
all residence halls, in the first floor landings of the
stairwells at both ends of the Administration Build-
ing and in the Campus Center Lobby.

Please call Kevin Williams (457-7980) for any
additional information.

Department also needs concluded by asking I‘If you as
taxpayers and voters can’t move
the politi“ians, who can?"

Assemblywoman Constance E.
Cook of Ithaca, chairman of the
Education Committee, and Assem-
blyman Alexander Chananau of
the Bronx, ranking Democrat on
the Ways and Means Committee,
proposed creation of a special
legislative commission to conduct
an inquiry to determine why New
York State Lottery receipts con-
tinue to be disappointing.

Mrs. Cook recalled original pre-
dictions that the New York lot-
tery would sell $30 million worth
of tickets a month. Instead, she
said, the gross has been netting
$2.5 million per month New Jer-

sey, with less than half New York‘s
population, is netting $3.5 million
a month from its lottery.

VotingAge Amendment

Passes the House

by John Beckler

WAsmNGTON (AP) _ A proposed constitutional amendment that
would lower the voting age in all elections to 18 won final
congressional approval today as it passed the House. It must now win
the approval of at least 38 state legislatures before it can be
incorporated into the Constitution as the 26th Amendment.

Backers of the amendment hope the ratification process can be
completed in time for the newly cnfranchised young voters to
participalil in the 1972 elections. The process normally takes about 15
months.

Congress pusscd a law last year lowering the voting age to 18 but the
SUPI‘CmU (Iourl held it valid only for federal elections. Unless the
proposed aincndmcnt is ratified, many states will have lotstablish two
sets of electoral machinery, one for federal elections and one for state
and local elections.

Schi'al states have begun to amend their own constitutions to lower
the voting agc to 18, but a rccont survey reported by the House
Judiciary Commiltcc indicates only eight could complete lllf' process
in time for the 1972 elections.

The proposed amendment states: “The right of citi'Lcns of the
United States, who are 18 years of age or older, to vote shall not be
denied or abridged by thc United States or by any state on account of
age." There are an estimated 1] million young Americans between 18
and 21 who would be eligible to vote under the new age limit.

SUNYA Acquires Land
For Radio Telescope

President Louis ’1‘. Bonuch has announced the acquisition by the
SUNYA foundation of a 200 acre tract of land in the Adirondack
Mountains. The land is a gift to SUNYA from Mr. and Mrs. Howard A.
LaRose of Lake George Village and will be used as the site for u
newly-acquired radio telescope. The Carnegie Institution of Washing
ton donated the radio telescope to Dudley Observatory, representing
SUNYA, RH and Union College.

Professor Joseph Erkes of the Department of Astronomy, project
director, stated that teaching and research will be the major uses of
the telescope. The 200 acre sitcI is located in a valley and was found
suitable in protecting the sensitch tclcscopc from strong winds, heavy
snow storms, and any direct radiation from radio and TV stations and
radars.

Once installed at its Adirondack site, the telescope will be the largest
in the statc and one of the largest fully steerable instruments in the
country. All professional astronomers in the 'i‘ri-City area will have
access to the instrument.
