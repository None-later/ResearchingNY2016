Strategic Withdrawal
at Full Gallop

Amid a deafening silence from Washington, South
Vietnam has been completely defeated in the Loatian
battle with the Communists. Some of the most
convincing antiwar “propaganda” ever seen has been
coming off the Associated Press teletype from regular
Indochina correspondents.

All of this has shown one thing: despite Richard
Nixon’s claims to the contrary. the much “reformed”
Army of the Republic of South Vietnam cannot fight
against ill-supplied (except , of course, by the South
Vietnamese) “irregulars” (who now have tanksl), even
with massive American air support. Uncle Dick and
the Pentagon boys have been working on that army
since Nixon was elected. and now the 22,000 ARVN
troops sent in (and you can bet they were the best)
have suffered 25% casualities officially , and are
running back to the border. American units have
been moved to the border area to prevent any drive
by the Communists into South Vietnam.

In a few weeks, when all the reports are in, and the
fighting is over. the Agnews of this land will start the
Big Lie about how successful it all was. When Spiro
speaks of success, remember that Saigon ofﬁcially
lost 6,000 men, one-third of the armored vehicles
they sent in, and all the inflated prestige that Laird
could innster during that “success”.

Thus the lie is put to the Vietnami'lation pi‘ograill.
which apparently has not changed the nature of the
ARVN III the slightest. Vietnami/ation was l)iel\
Nixon's big plan, and it has failed.

To all those who say, as Dickie aitd Saigon want
)’()LI [0 Sily, [llilt LIIL' UPL'I'iILlUII WEIS (lllly SUPPUSC‘I Ill
last six weeks, and this is ‘just the natural ending to it.
think again.

Any successful military operation is supposed to

leave the "enemy' a shambles. not strong enough to
invade your country. And setoiid. ill the retreat was
[)filillli'il, why not simply say that we ll/illllll‘lf to stay
in South Vietnam only eIeVen years. and withdraw all
American troops now.

Loas has proven that we cannot win. Why ill hell do
our “elected representatives" keep us there?

ARE RETURNING FROM LAOS TO SOUTH VIETNAMI'

Day Ca re
To the Editor:

I am very distressed over the
possibility that Albany State may
lose its Day Care Center. And if
my little son could understand, he
would be its upsot as I. lie IOVes
his days there.

My husband and I are full-time
students living on his part-time
earnings and the GI Bill. Without
the Center, I wouldn‘t be attend-
ing school this semester; we just.
couldn't squeeze out money any
longer to pay the baby sitter. And
if the Center closes, I won‘t be
able to return in September for
my senior year.

This may not seem important to
anyone but me, yet isn't it good
for the general society if evury
bright, motivated person gets an
educalion? EVi-ry politician and
administrator pays lip survive to
this idea, and it is used to justify
many lax-supported programs,
such as [he (il Bill, EOI’, and state
scholarships, We need the fully-
developed resources of all the
people, iiol of everyone ea‘ci'pl
mothers.

According to Barbara Etlclmaii's
ASI’ article, some people oppose
Day (.‘are on the grounds [but
children will be harmed if they‘re
si-pariili-tl from their mothers. I
wish these conscientious objectors
would pruscnl their evidenee.
ICVi-rylhing I have read on the
subject indicates that most child-
ren are not hurt, and may be
helped, by spending part 0i the
day at il well-run Day Care facil-
ity For example, opponents
might feel better if they read the
Februry 20 issue of Saturday Re-
I'll'ILl, which features a special see-
lion on Day Care.

Anyway, why not let us parents
judge our children's reaction to
Day Care? We love them, we
know when they're unhappy, and
we can always stop leaving them if
necessary. I'm sure that my son is
having a positive experience at the
Day Care Center. You can‘t. walk
through the crowd of healthy,

busy children there and feel that
they're being mistreated. They‘re
huving fun!

Day Care director Blair Barrett
said that when the budget is cut,
"people's programs go first." I
hope that the university commun-
ity will fight to keep the Day Care
Center and prove that at Albany,
people's needs come first.

Case Against
Warner

To the Editor:

Bob Warner‘s March i7 case
against (rend, convietion of)
Nixon fairly begs for some sort of
comment. Speeil‘ie errors of fact,
logical non sequiturs, and even
grammatical soleeisms could be
nienlionetl, but that would l)l‘ loo
tronblesome-rnay, impolite. Bob's
main lapse is a common one at
SUNYA~-he has believed the lib-
l'l'lll rhetoric, He appears honestly
to believe that unemployment,
poverty, racism, militarism, el eel-
era ail naseum, are “problems”
that could be solved if only the
right government would providen-
liiilly arrch al the scene. Unfor-
tunately, none of these is a “prob-
lem“ that government, any
govornnienl, can solve, 'l‘hey are
"acts of life, if you Will‘ﬁlmi‘llltblL‘
to government alteration, trans-
formation, mussnge, masquerade.
hoeus puens-ncver to be ex.
punged.

Believing that a government can
"solve" or even mitigiile these
“problems” leads only to the in-
evitable enraged disappointment
so well exemplified by Mr. War-
ner's illustrated barrage, and those
who feel that. u “humane” govern-
ment can cure these ills leaving no
one to pay the bills will always
feel cheated. One result, of
course, is this type of liberal
boohuoism whieh is so common
today— and so utterly boring.

Vote Mandatory

Open letter to
the University Community:

In the near future, all students
will have the opporlunity and
responsibility to vote for ll'll' cori-
tinuation or aholishment of
mandatory student tax. I fear [Ital
many students are not aware of
the implication that this vote t'lir'
ries. It should be made clear to all
students that currently almost all
student activities are eomph-iely
or partially funded by student
tax. If the mandatory tax is th-
feated all these student activities
will have to run on limited liuil~
gels, thus crippling their effective»
ness.

For example, the prices of con
certs (and there Would he a Innu
ed number of concerts) would be
double the current prices for sin
dents who paid lbc tax, and prob
ably triple the ciirri-nl [ti'li'i's tor
students wishing noi to put tltt‘
tax. Without mandatory ias, ll]
triimiiral sports migbi have to he
completely abolished, and .III\
clubs, groups, or organizations
that llI'l.‘ sponsored by student tax
would have to run on austerity
budgets.

in the absence of nianilaiorj'

Mimi you that doesn't mean they acceptor! it....

| APPEALED A PARKING TICKET...AND LIVED!

by Irk Tauljd
An ASP Column

Through a high position in one of our campus
media, I came into an “ofﬁcial business" permit for
my vehicle. Asking about its use, I was told only,
“it’s good anywhere, but especially behind the Ed
building," and, like a fool, I believed it.

Well, needless to any, I eventually came across
three of those familiar yellow slips we Call tickets
(they call them "summonses.") They all descended
upon my auto in a small space of time, so they went.
to the Parking Ticket Appeals Committee in a
group.

Meanwhile, I got. cold feet and moved the ear to
the parking lot.

I should explain that. I‘m a resident student here.
This means that. I live on a quad, which you aren't
supposed to park next. to (I‘ll get. to that), and
especially not at night, because that’s when they
give out. tickets (how many eommuters/faculty/staff
are parked, legally or not, at. 5 a.m.?).

The tickets came back, in the form of an “appeal
rejected,” about two weeks later. I now owed
Security $13 or they’d tow my vehicle away. My
friend in Student Government who knows told me

to appeal it in person when the committee met
(Tuesdays at. 1 :30 in the Campus Center.)

And so I went to the Parking Tickets Appeals

Committee with my rejections.

At about 15 minutes to two, the Chairman of the
Committee showed up. I introduced myself. He had
heard of me. Already I've half-lost. the ease, I
thought to myself.

The rest of the Committee showed up. They
produced a multicolored map of parking zone. As
we gazed at. the map we cleared up two of my
tickets— I admitted parking on X Quad, and the
Committee claimed that. nobody could park there.
The appeals remained rejected.

Bit. by bit, I began to understand the nature of the
Committee. Curiousity got the best of me, and I
started to ask about parking rules and guidelines for
appeal. My tickets I wrote off as lost, and went on
to bigger things.

The parking Ticket Appeals Committee acts as a
judiciary branch of the Parking Problem. The
University Senate is the legislature, and Security is
the executive. A system with one major flaw: lack
of stuff precludes effective enforcement, they seem
to want to keep the rules secret, rather than explain
the real reason for non-enforcement.

For instance, do you know what an accessible
roadway means? My dictionary deﬁnes it as “open
to approach." Even though it doesn't say this in the
little rule list, the confidential PTA Committee
definition of "accessible" is “having an open gate at
the end of the road." Thus, the real indicator of

permission to park on the quad ll the little unto
when! the road meets Perimeter road. If security has
opened the particular "gate near your quad, they
have given their sanction to your parking near the
dorms-for twenty minutes. If that unto in closed,
you're taking a chance on the Security roulette
wheel. '

.For Security cracks down sporadically on viola-
tion (i.e. parked cars), and. the rules, despite the
laxity in enforcement, are tough. First offense cost
$1, the second $3, third and over,$6. It adds up to
$40,000 yearly, which iii spent on the parking lots.

Weekends are notoriously lax‘. Security men will
conﬁdentially toll you that they don't. enforce the
rules on weekends, but Jim William won’t. As chief
of security, he's not allowed to. And so, sometimes
you get tickets on Sunday. I did. Again, watch that
gate. They do, however, let you park in any lot
(commuter, faculty/staff, renidentithat you wont to”
between 4 pm. Friday and 8 pm. Sunday. Same
goes for the Circle out Front.

One last thing about the Parking Committee. They
do allow exemptions from tickets if you have their
kind of valid reason— like, the ;car stalled, or you
broke your leg. They don’t. excuse you for ignor-
ance, though, so take the advice of someone who's
been through it: park in the lots. I do.

If you like living dangerously, remembpr what I've
said. Follow the rules, if you find them.
