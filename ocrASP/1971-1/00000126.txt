New Education Proposals
Involve Parental Role

New and innovative approaches
to evaluation of school districts
with low achievers, counseling of
parents, providing safety in
schools, transporting pupils and
ﬁnancing education were revealed
by Assemblyman Stanley Har-
wood, ranking minority member
of the Assembly Education Com-
mittee, today as he submitted a
package of seven bills concerning
education.

The proposed measures would:

--Establish quality education
programs and evaluate schools
with a history of student failure.

--Provide specific aid for schools
with students below norm in
mathematics and reading.

--lnitiate parental counseling
programs to investigate and train
parents in how to assist their
children at home.

--Review transportation methods
in an effort to make them more
efﬁcient.

--Put safety ofﬁcers in schools to
protect students.

--Provide tax relief for high tax-
low wealth school districts.

--Place the cost of education
directly on the State and not on
the local property taxpayer.

The first Harwood proposal
would set up a Performance Eval-
uation Commission to review and
make specific recommendations
on the educational performance
of specific schools and school
districts.

"We have schools with a long
history of student failure," the
Naussau County Democrat said.
"Conversely, we also have schools

with a long history of pupil suc-
cess. This Commission would stu-
dy all aspects of both types of
districts and formulate a plan,
including the financial procedures,
for bringing the unsuccessful dis-
trict up to the standards of the
successful ones."

According to Harwood, “In
1966 there were schools in New
York State where 60 percent of
the class could not pass basic
competence examinations in read-
ing and mathematics. That percen-
tage rose to 80 in 1969 in these
same schools."

influencing Education

“Proper diet, health care, home
environment, parental attitude
and other non-school realtcd fac-
tors have a large impact on how
well a student does," Harwood
said, as he introduced a bill which
would set up counseling programs
to “assist parents of children with
learning difficulties."

“Many studies hich been com-
pleted on the factors which affect
a student's academic success,“ the
11th Assembly District represen-
tative explained, "and the single
factor which stands out the most
as affecting it is parental influ-
ence."

"At present, parent counseling is
limited to about one or two
parent-teacher conferences per
year and these usually take place
at the school. Yet, the parental
influence on a student is most
often exerted in the home,"

Another Harwood measure
would "provide for officers in our
schools.”

“Many schools have been vic-
tims of internal distrubances of a
violent nature," he said. “This
program would provide for one
safety ofﬁcer per 2,000 _students
in a particular school."

The proposed safety officer
would not be a member of the
traditional community police
force. “He would be specially
trained to handle young people
and their problems. Part of his job
would be preventive — handling
potentially explosive situations
before they occur - rather than
apprehensive."

To correct the inequalities in the
present state aid formula, Har-
wood is sponsoring a measure
which would "provide additional
property tax relief to low wealth
areas."

Legislature Discusses New

Abortion Rules Changes

by .l. Steven Flaviii

State Senator Tiirky Lombardi,
Chairman of the Senate Health
Committee, said he was “shocked
to learn that certain hospitals givv
discounts to referral agencies that
advertise nationally and send wo-
men to New York State for abor-
tions."

“Al. the expense of desperate,
frightened women, these agencies
are making a huge proﬁt," said
Lombardi, Republican, Syracuse.
“We must educate both residents
and nonresident); to the fact that
almost every major community in
new York has ii nonprofit abor-
tion referral and counseling scr»
vice."

According to Lombardi, “The
least costly way for a woman to
receive an abortion is to deal
directly with hospitals." Members
of the Senate Health Committee
“have heard shocking testimony
about the profits being reaped
from women."

The discount system was termed

"scandalous" by Dr. Alan F. Gutt-
niachcr, president of Planned
Parenthood-World Population,
“Those who proﬁt from abortion
referrals should be curbed," Gutt-
mnchcr added, “and this out-of-
stute advertising should be cur-
tailed.

.“Ncw York‘s abortion law is
lunctioiiing well" Guttmachcr
said, and urged legislators not to
amend it. Guttmachcr contends
that available statistics show “that
abortions under the new law haVc
been performed with a very high
dcgroc of safety and ii Very low
level of medical complications."

Guttmaclicr, opposing adding it
residency requirement, explained,
"My sense of humanity tells me
that a woman in New Jersey or
Massachuseth is just as entitled to
safe, medical abortion in; ii woman
in New York."

Another proposed change to the
"liberal" abortion law would re-
duce the time allowed for an

abortion from the prcscnt 21
weeks of pregnancy was also up-
posed by Guttmaclfcr.

“I fear if pregnancy duration is
materially curtailed it will throw
those cases which most need llll‘
safest and best medical facilities
back into the unsafe, clandcstini-
auspices of the illegal abortion-
ist," Guttmachcr summizcd.

Lombardi said the Senate Health
Committee is working with Attor-
ncy Gcncml chkowit'l. to draft
regulatory legislation for lllt‘
many abortion referral agciicics
who advertise nationally.

chkowitz is getting officials'
views on whether the commercial
abortionArcfcrral agencies, which
charge fees from $50 to $160 for
referring women to clinics or hos»
pitiils, should be outlawed or rcgii-
liitcd.

The consensus of the com-
mittee, Lefkowitz said, “leans to-
ward abolition" of commercial
agencies, but those attending
agreed that if they are outlawed a
free referral service must be estab-
lishcd to replace them.

NOW Founder Supports:

Rally to Save

by Ariilyiiii Abarc

Betty Fricdan, author of The
Ft‘lnflilIH' Mystique, founder of
NOW (National Organization for
Women), and prominent spokes-
woman for the women's liberation
movement in America, voiced sup-
port Wedncsduy for tomorrow's
Women‘s Strike Coiilitioii march
on the Capitol.

Friedan and other Women’s Lib
represenuitivias spoke at a press
Confcrvnce held before the Capi~
tol District Women's Press Club
debate with Burnett Fowler,
Times Union columnist.

About the march, she empha-
sized that “the prominence tlierc
will be of young women, cspcciiil-
ly thosi- studcnls who cannot get
out during llli‘ wcck, who will
make llii-ir numbcrs fcll."

lfi'ii-tlaii vmvcd, “W0 will not
ltill'l'illt' any messing with this law
lllitl, for llll' first time in ii hun-
ilrcil yi-aii's, givcs women llic right

of control over their own bodies."
Slic culled “olisccnc and immoral"
llll' idea that “any politician, or
and li-gisliilor would treat women,
who ill'{' 55”?» of the voting populii-
lion of tho Stale of New York,
with such contempt iii the rcqucsl
of iiiiy political or religious pres-
sui'c group, which would dare try
to liikc back our right to control
our own bodies, and our own
reproductch proccsscs.”

'l‘lic demonstration is to protest
thi- -l2 bills currcntly bcforc tlitI
legislature to restrict abortion.
'l‘hcsc bills range from reducing
the time period for justifiable
abortions to twelve weeks from
commencement of pregnancy, to
barring women from abortion
whose husbands, if they are living
together, do not consent.

Cathy Walsh, of SUNYA Wo-
mon'a Lib, explained that Sutur-

diiy's march, called for by the
Women‘s Strike Coalition of New

York City, will start from Draper
Hall at 12:30 p.m., and proceed
along Washington Avenue to the
Capitol fora 1 pm. rally.

The Women's Strike Coalition is
CUmPUStid of about 100 NYC
groups who support three basic
demands: free abortion on de-
mand with no forced sterilization;
frec 24-hour community con-
trolled child care; and equal job
and educiitiiionl opportunities.

“This coalition,” Friediin ex-
plained, “is one of the many new
efforts of unity among women
who Iiich coalesced as ii result of
the August 26 Women‘s Strike,
when more women that ever be-
forc joined to act in llicir own
intcrcst in any time or place."
“That was only lltl‘ beginning,"
shc affirmed, “and now we are
lriiiisliiting tliiil energy into politi-
('lll powci'."

Along this line, Mrs. Fricdiin
announced the formation of ii
Woman's l’oliticnl Caucus. in
which “Republican and Demo
ci'iitic women, as well as women
who no longer support any party"
will join to demand that 50% of
all candidates for iill political of-
fice be women.

Another women's
donated by Fricdiin was the mass
lobby pliiiiiicd for next Wednes-
day at the Capitol. Hundreds of
members and representatives of
45 medical, civic, religious, politi-
cal and women's organizations
which form the Coalition of Or.
giinizutions for Abortion Rights
(COFAR), plus the Westclicstcr
Committee for Legal Abortion,
are expected to converge on the
legislature to petition lawmakers
to oppose any NYS abortion law
restriction.

“These women. also in an unpre~
cendented organization, are

coming," explained Friedan, “to
express a political determination
to protect the hard-won right. of
women, and to confront those
who should tamper with it.”

Jiinc Trichtcr, representing
COFAR, defined the general pur»
pose of the group, which is to
“oppose all efforts to add any
restrictions to the present abor-
tion law, and to support all efforts
to enhance the right of individuals
to limit their own reproduction."

Fricdan threatened revenge
upon any “man who tolerates any
tampering with this law, from
Governor Rockefeller on down,
(as) enemies of women" and she
promised "cxcommunication"
from office for any legislator who
supports restricting abortion
legislation.

Coalition

by Harry Weiner

During the month of December, 1970, student
groups from the United States. South Vietnam and
North Vietnam met to discuss a treaty which would
contain the essentials for a just and immediate peace
in Indochina. The results of those meetings, better
known as the “People's Peace Treaty," and the
initial plans for May’s actions were discussed on
each of the quads Wednesday and Thursday nights.
A documentary on today‘s North Vietnamese so-
ciety, "People’s War," was also included in each of
the discussions.

The Albany Coalition for Peace and Justice
sponsored these discussions, in the hopes of increas-
ing SUNYA’s awareness to the ever-escalating war in
Southeast Asia. Although a great deal of time was
spent viewing the film at each campus gathering, the
major emphasis was placed upon the students'
signing of petitions endorsing the Joint Peace Treaty
which was enacted last Christmas by the members
of the American Students Delegation, the North
Vietnam National Union of Students, and the South
Vietnam Liberation Students Union. The petition-
ing is hoped to show solidarity behind the treaty,
the essence of which boils down to three major
demands which will be made on Congress: (1) the
immediate withdrawal of all US. support in South-
east Asia, (2) a minimum income of $6500 for a
family of four in Vietnam, and (3) the freeing of all
political prisoners. The treaty also demanded
specific dates when each of the above demands were
to take effect.

A spokesman for the "Albany Coalition" said that
the organization had high expectations for the 1971
spring offensive. Among the most ambitious of
these plans were: (1) Mass rallies to be held on April
2-lth in Washington and San Fransisco centering on
the three demands, (2) ii march from the SUNYA
downtown campus to the First Trust Bank of
Albany on April 30th demanding an end to their
investment in war related industries, and (3) various
events in Washington during the first few days in
May culminating in a national moratorium on Miiy
5th, when “schools, colleges, and businesses" should
close.

More definite plans for the spring actions are
expected to be announced after the spring recess. In
the meantime, the Albany Coalition for Peace and
Justice is trying to “wake-up" the “emotions and
consciousness" of the community, both on and off
campus. The film, peace treaty, and plans for spring
action, are expected to be the first step in thawing
out a movement which has become more or less
frozen during the long. cold winter.
