Roommates; or Know Your Enemy

You'd think that with all the progress we’ve made in the educa-
tion game, somebody would have found a cure for roommates by now.
But no. Roommates remain as big a problem today as they were when
Ethan Mather founded the ﬁrst American college.
(Incidentally, despite what you've heard, Harvard was not the
ﬁrst American college. Mr. Mather started his institution almost 100
years earlier. And it was quite an institution, let me tell you! Mr.
Mather built schools of liberal arts, ﬁne arts, animal dentistry and
flintlock repair. He built a covered stadium for lacrosse that seated
200,000. Everywhere on campus was emblazoned the stirring Latin
motto CAVE MUSSI—“Watch out for moose." The student union
contained four bowling alleys, 21 horoscope machines and a 97-chair
barbershop.
(It was the barbershop, alas, that brought Mr. Mather’s college
to an early and total end. The student body, alas, then as now, con-
sidered haircuts an Establishment hangup. and nobody set foot in the
barbershop. The chief barber, Truscott Follicle by name' grew so de—
pressed staring at 97 empty chairs that one day his mind ﬁnally gave
way. Seizing his vibrator, he ran outside and shook the entire campus
until it crumpled to dust. This later became known as “Pickett’s
Charge")
But I digress. We were exploring ways for you and your roommate
to stop hating each other. This is admittedly no easy task, and yet it
is not impossible if you will both bend a bit, give a little.
I remember, for example, my own college days (Berlitz, '08). My
roommate was, I think you will allow, even less agreeable than most.
He was a Tibetan named Ringading whose native customs, while in—
disputany colorful, were not entirely endearing. Mark you, I didn't
mind so much the gong he struck on the hour or the string of fire-
crackers he ignited on the half-hour. I didn't even mind that he singed
chicken feathers during his prayers at dawn and dusk. What I did
mind was that he singed them in my hat.

 

To be fair, he was not totally taken with some of my habits either
—espccialiy my hobby. (I collect airplane tires and had, at that time,
nearly 400,000 of them in our room.)

Well sir, things grew steadily cooler between Ringading and me,
and they might actually have reached the breaking point had not we
each happened to receive a package from home one day. Ringading
opened his package first, smiled shyly at me and offered me a gift.
“Thank you," I said. “What is it?"

“Yak butter," he said. “You put it in your hair. In Tibet we call
It area are kidsiuﬂ.”

“Well now, that's mighty friendly," I said and offered him a gift
from my package.

"Thank you," he said. “What is it?"

"A can of Miller High Life Beer," I said.

"I will try it at once," he said and did.

“Not bad," he said.

“It is even better when you open the can,” I said and showed
him how.

He consumed It forthwith. "Wowdowl" he cried. "Never have I
known such mellowness, smoothness, amberness and generalized
ouphoriai"

"Have another," I said.

“Oh, I must not!" he cried. "Obviously a beverage of such splen-
dor Is made only for rare occasions and Is therefore difficult to obtain

and costly beyond the reckoning of it."

"Ha. ha, the joke Is on you," I said. “Miller High Life is brewed

every single day by plain decent folks just like you and me and is avail-

able everywhere at a price well within the most modest of budgets."

"Golly," he said. “Sort of makes a man feel humble."

“Yes, don't It?" I said.

Then silently we clasped hands, friends at last. I am proud to say

we remain friends to this day. We exchange cards such Christmas and

each Fourth of July, firecrackers.

lay offs and poor working conditions. The workers at both schools are unionized.

Tran Van Dinh Speaks:
“Vietnamization a Failure”

by John Fairhall

Tron Van Dinh, formerly South
Vietnam's Acting Ambassador to
the United States, spoke here
Tuesday and charged that the
Vietnamization program is perpet-
uating the war.

Van Dinh said that Vletnamiza~
tior can not work. According to
him, it must necessarily prolong
the war through its requirement
that the US. continue to supply
and support the South Victim-
mesc Army (ARVN). Van Dinh
stated that the South Vietnamese
can not fight because of Viclnnmi-
zntinn, claiming that Victnamiza-
lion is "Amoricrmizing the South
Vietnamese Army." Van Dinh
fuels that Laotian failure demon-
strates that ARVN can not fight
with the dedication of the Viet
Cong, he fools their ﬁghting ubili-
ty is undermined by their depen-
dence on U.S. aid.

U.S. aid is a crutch that Vietna-
mizntion will maintain into the
indeterminate future, as Van Dinh
believes, producing continued
confrontations with Hanoi. lie im-
plied that the US. is in effect
fueling the war, a war which Van
Dinh is convinced can not be
halted through U.S. military sup-
port. Vim Dinh stated that Nixon
has no military tactics.

Believing continued use of air-
powcr and other tactics to be a
part of Vietnamization, Van Dinh
speculated that to compensate for
tho Laotian losses a sudden strike

into the North may be planned.
He did not rule out the possible
American use of tactical nuclear
weapons but emphasized that
even in that extreme the war
would continue. Nixon, he feels,
may be blinded through confusing
the Vietnam war with the Korean
conflict.

It is necessary for Americans,
Van Dinh said, to see the war
from the Vietnamese perspective.
He clearly suggested that Ameri-
ca's perooptions of the war are not
accurate, but illusions encouraged
by Nixon's harping on “neo-
isolationism."

Nixon, he believas, will lose in
‘72. Ho admires George McGovern
because he thinks McGovern will
confront the issues, helping to
bring Vietnam into better focus.
Confronting the issues, Van Dinh
said, is the first step toward
“humanizing America." It is nece-
ssary to humanize America for the
war to end, as he believes that the
"war in lndochina is in America."
The war started here and must
end here, he stated.

Van Dinh, who supports a docu-
ment called the People's Peace
Treaty which demands a mini-
mum $6500 a year income for a
family of four and the rcleaso of
all political prisoners, as well as
the end of the war, expressed his
belief that the academic commun-
ity can best influence policy
through contacts with other
Americans. Students, he feels, do
not represent American thinking,

but he believes that the "other

Van Dinh is presently working
as a journalist and is teaching at
the SUNY center at Old West-
bury.

Stony Brook Workers
Protest Mass Lay-off

by Vicki Gottlich

Campus cafeteria workers at
SUNY at Stony Brook have been
striking the Prophet Food
Company, a subsidiary of Grey-
hound Food Service Company,
since March 9, when the company
fired 318 full-time, part-time, and
student workers.

 

The strikers are protesting the
mass lay-off of workers. The day
after the strike was called, student
supporters occupied the presi-
dent's office for several hours and
held the vice-president hostage.
On Monday, union president Leon
Davis spoke at a rally at the
university and promised to do
what the workers demand. Ever
since the strike began, there have
been between thirty and forty
pickets in front of the administra-
tion building each day.

The Stony Brook food service
workers were unionized last year.
Anyone working for twelve hours
or more is eligible for membership
in local 1199 of the Hospital and
Drug Workers Union.

When the workers first struck,
the dispute was brought to
arbitration. Monday, a decision
was made in favor of the food
company. The food company has
two contracts with the university,
one involved with feeding the
students and the other involved
with the union. The arbitrator
declared that the food company
could change its contract and
could legally make mass lay-offs.

Wednesday, Judge Anthony Tro-
vla of the First Federal District
Court in Brooklyn issued an in-
junction restraining the union
from further strikes. The union
leaders only want to do what the
workers decide. If they continue
to strike, the leaders can be hea-
vily fined or sent to jail, or federal
marshalls can be called in.

The strike has been indirectly
linked with SUNY Central’s deci-
sion to allow optional meal plans.
Last fall, a littiel knOWn provision
in the StonyBrook meal contract
gave the students the right to go
off the meal plan, before the
contract was signed. Before inter-
seision, the housing office
surveyed students and discovored
that the majority of them wanted
to break their contracts. There-
fore, three cafeterias were opened
as cash cafeterias while only two
were kept on board. Now, only
slightly more than 1000 students
remain on the meal plan-This
may have caused the Prophet
Food Company to fire some of its
workers.

Other universities are also having
food service problems. Dishroorn
workers at the Men's Dining Cen-
ter at the University of Rochester
are striking over poor working
conditions and schedules. Strike
lenders there are charging that any
worker attempting to organize
while on duty or any Egtuden',
talking to permanent workers
about the possibility of unioniza-
tion was threatened with sus-
pension.
