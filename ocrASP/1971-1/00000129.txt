State 9 Open Against RPI.

by Robert Mirett

The near-record snowfall this
past winter makes it appear that
spring will be later than ever this
baseball season and this presents a
rather serious problem for State
Baseball Coach Bob Burlingame.

In battling the cold weuLhEr,
Conch Burlingume has been pre-
paring his bit“ club for the upcom-
ing season by working indoors.
"We have u three-station set up
for practice,” said the Dane
coach. “We have a ‘bullpen‘ with a
dirt. mount in the biology build-
ing, a batting cage in the tncns‘
auxiliary gum and also use the
main gym.“ The Great Danes

work on their sliding on mats, and
bolt bases to the floor of the main
gym when they hold inﬁeld prac-
tice.

In viewing the team. Burlingnme

said the Dnnes' defense
depth is “adequate.” “The hitters
will be doing most of the playing
as there is not much difference in
defensive abilities based on Fall
results. It also looks as if the
Danes will have good speed with
Al Reid and Rod Dunbar leading
the pack ofspeedsters."

Individually, Al Reid was the
Team‘s top hitter last year with a
mark of .390 and is set. in center
field while over in right field

Tedeaco, a transfer from HUCC,
Gary Achminski, a junior variety
ball player last. year, and John
Zimmerman, a returning letter
man, are all fighting for the left
ﬁeld spot. Both captain Torn
Brooks, who hit .304 in the Fall,
at shortstop, and Rod Dunbar at
second base, are secure. While
there are head-on struggles for
ﬁrst and third positions. At. first
it's Jim Lee and Rick Ward and at.
the hot. corner it’s Jeff Saperstein
and Bill Lipp. Jack Leahy. who
had a good Fall batting .37 5, will
be starting behind the plate. Pitch-
ing wise, the Danes are deep with
Nick Ascienzo and Hi Doolittle,
who had three and four wine
respectively last year. Added
mound support will come from
Vic Errunte, who was the most
impressive J.V. hurler last season,
and also from freshman Kevin
Quinn.

On April 6 State will be meeting
RPI in the opening game of the
season, with RPI coming off a
Southern trip the day before. Al-
bany will not. make such a trip
this year because of the shift in
spring recess dates which pro-
duced a relatively short time off—
too short a time to go South.

This apring's squad is deﬁnitely
the best in many years depth-wise
and will be looking to improve on
last year's record of 8 wins and 11
losses.
