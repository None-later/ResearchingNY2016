Action 0n

Environment Urged

by Met Heyman
and Rick Morse

Environment has been labeled
the issue of the 70's. Issue implies
campaign, campaign implies politi-
cal rhetoric. Beyond the rhetoric,
beyond the neutrality of
"environment": in contrast to
more controversial issues such as
the Southeast Asian War, the im-
plications are the same; time is o/
the essence.

In order that our environment

may be salvaged now and not in
some imaginary time in the future
the most viable course of action at
the present time is to bring pres-
sure on the State Legislature. This
summary of some of the environ‘
mental issues on tile state level is
being offered as a guide to action.
a suggested course of action
would be either writing or calling
legislators or taking advantage of
our location and visiting these
people. A show ofsupporl will be
critical to the passage of legisla-
tion.
Political‘ rhetoric about “envir-
onment” is too well known; we
propose to end it on the students'
part.

The Future of the Adirondacks

The future of the Adirondacks
area is a vital conservation issue. A
new York State Temporary Com-
mission has finished a comprehen-
sive study of the area and made
many stringent recommendations
concerning control and develop-
ment of the Adirondacks. Most
important in their eyes is the
quick establishment of an Adiron-
dack Park Agency to cXcrt control
over this valuable area. There are
opposing interests: timber indus-
tries, group camps, and land
"developers" in general. Public
support for an Adirondack Agen-
cy is vital. Contact your Assem-
blyman and Senator as Well as the
Governor‘s office at the Capitol,

Department of Environmental
Conservation Budget Cut

This department, which was es-
tablished last year at the height of
“environmental” concernI is the
only state agency available for
action on environmental prob-

lems. The Ways and Means Com-
mittee of the Assembly is pro-
posing a $4.7 million out in this
department’s budget. The enforce-
ment capability of the DEC as
well as its field services will be
severely hampered. (Further infor-
mation is available in FA 218.)
Most important to contact are the
chairmen of the Senate Finance
Committee and the Assembly
Ways and Means Committee.

Bill No. 2816 -
Introduced by Mr. Harris

This bill prohibits the sale or
distribution of household deter-
gent products in New York State
with a phosphorous content in
excess of three per cent of the
total weight of the product.

Bill No. 2817 —
Introduced by Mr. Harris

This bill prohibits the discharge
of mercury or mercurial com-
pounds from industrial and com-
mercial operations.

Bill No. 4231 —
Introduced by Mr. Berle

This bill amends the civil prac-
tice law and rules in order that a
citizen or group of citizens may
bring legal action against anyone
who pollutcs, impairs or destroys
the air. water, or other natural
resources or the public [rust of
the state or which invades or is
reasonably likely to invade the
rigth of the citizens of the state.
This bill provides for no out of
court settlements, forcing courl
decision rather than “under the
table pay-offs." it also provides
for a cost ceiling on legal fees for
the plaintiff. This would be a very
important asset to environmental
interests in the state,

The above bills are presently ill
the Committee on Conservation,
and will need a great amount of
public support to move oul onto
the floor. Time is of the essence.

Record Co-op To Open

by Tony Haul
All ASP l“('t1[ltl‘l.’

HaVc you ever wondered why
record albums are so expensive? It
scams many students have and
some are getting together to try
alld gct ll non-profit record co-op
going on campus. Think it‘s im-
possible? Well it might be, but
arrangements haVc been made and
the “People's Record Store" has
emerged in the basement of An‘
thony Hall on Statc Quad.

Although there are definitely
many problems involved, the An-
tllony llall “Conspiracy for The
People" is selling many albums for
a more $1.55. All "D" Albums
that would normally scll l'or$3.57
in the bookstore will go for $3.00
and "E's" for$£l.50I.

Stores similar to this one have
been set up on the Stony Brook
and Buffalo campuses and are
thriving. It seems there might be
some problems here at SUNYA
because the SA. has contract with
FSA that stipulates that the Stu-
dent Association cnllnol. license
anybody to scll itcms on campus
that lll'c also sold ill thc book-
slorc. The organisers of lhc co~llp
who, for the timLI wish to remain
uuonylllous, replied that, “if lllc
l’SA was Iruly serving lllc stu»
(lcllls llcrc t0 the bl-sl of their
abilities, they would l'lllll'l‘ pcrmil

prices to sound u lol more like
ours".

It may be lulled Ill-rtI (hill
the Bookstore makes slightly
under a dollar on each record they
sell. (Because of the absurd pric-
ing in the Bookstore it's probllblc
that more records are stolen than
bought there anyway.)
