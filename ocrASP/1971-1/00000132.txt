Will Be Done

‘Q

Once upon a time, there was an extremely modern country hidden
away in the small foothills of New York, bounded by a thoroughly
modern road and a thoroughly dead river. The country was known for
its futuristic architecture and way of life in which the people were
supposedly free to choose their daily schedules. Socialistic in nature
(everyone supposedly was equal), the country was ruled by a king
who presided over the running of many committees. It was a lovely
country~ sunny, but it triﬂe windy.

One day, as the snow was beginning to thaw and the sun was
beginning to hang around with a little more consistency, and it
seemed closer to spring, the housing office decided it was time to look
towards housing for the future generations expected to arrive in late
August. Among their papers, the officials found petitions from several
buildings asking that they be allowed to house both male and female
citizens.

“Covet” How can that be? It seems to me that many members of
one sex don't know that. the other exists," said the first official.

"Maybe we should let them live together, then. They might learn
something," said the second official.

“That's immoral!" chorused the other officials.

“It‘s against the highest housing laws of the world, those created by
the Dormitory Authority. You can't have members of the opposite
sux sharing the same bathroom," l'l‘ :indt'd the third official.

“No! No!" cried the St‘(‘()ll(l official. “Not in the same suite. Across
the hall- the some lounge ' as neighbors, but not in the same suite. It's
what l|u> iii‘llllll‘ want. and Wu urn supposuil to follow the wishes of
llui lit'tl'ill‘. [molt at all lllt' Slﬂllllllll't‘h on lllt‘Sl‘ pvtilions."
