Three major State teams will be heading down the Thruway and
stopping off at Long island to play some local colleges there over the
upcoming Easter Holiday vacation. The teams making the trip will be
the Varsity Baseball, Lacrosse, and Tennis squads.

The snow has been gone in the big city and its suburbs for quite a
few weeks now, and the green grass should be a most welcome sight
for the SUNYA athletes who have been battling the white stuff up
here, with no real end in sight.

The Lacrosse Team, losers in their opening scrimmage against RPI,
have yet to escape the confines of the SUNYA gymnasium. The
Baseball team has likewise been condemned to playing baseball on
basketball courts. The Varsity Tennis squad in the meantime has been
thus far spending their spring inside some gym somewhere in the city
of Albany.

«as

 

All three teams will certainly appreciate some sunshine and fresh air
and would also appreciate some support from Long Island dwelling

---poI.rkuwski Dane supporters.

800 View Judo Tournament

The Fifth Annual East Coast
Invitational Judo Tournament
opened in the SUNYA Gym at
about noon yesterday. Robert
Fountain, Tournament Director
and State Judo Club instructor,
started the exciting yearly special
off with the US. rind Japanese
National Anthems. Their, the
younger aged Junior Judokas took
the mat to start the com petition
off.

After the Junior finals, everyone
was trcrited to an excellent Airado
(self-defense murshall art) demon-
stration featuring two black belts.
The next major event brought on
the Senior men‘s white and green
belts. The Albany Judo Club did
extremely well in taking a first
and second place in the men's
middle weight division, and a first
place in the men‘s lightweight
division. The honors went to Jon
Kerhs, 1st place; and Randy, 2nd
placc(n'iiddleweiglit), and to Jack
Ludin, lst plircc (lightweight).

In the brown belt competition,
Albany had three competitors
cntered,Mike Privy, Kevin
Kazucos, and Doug Salomon. At
press time all three were still in
doubt of the final results, but
things looked especially good for
Privy, who had already won his
first two matches.

 

The Albany State Judo (‘1th saw a ftili year of practice and
preparation bear fruit as they threw rminy ati opposing Judo player
yesterday, and took several riiediils in the tournament competition.

Harlem Dance Theatre

The highly regarded Dance
Theatre" of Harlem, under the
direction of Arthur Mitchell, will
perform at Union College's Mc-
morial Chapel, Friday, April 2.

This exciting young company,
whose dancers average 19 years of
age, has been the talk of the dance
world almost from the day in
1968 when it was conceived by
Mitchell.

A principal dancer and the first.
black soloist with the New York
City Ballet, Mitchell turned his
attention to forming a classical
dance school and company in
Harlem after hearing of the death
of Martin Luther King.

He pursuaded Karel Shook, the
ballet master of the Netherlands
National Ballet to join him in
Harlem and opened the school
that attracted mostly novices in
classical dance.

In less than a year, the Dance

Theatre of Harlem opened its
doors to the public and by last

fall, it had won critical acclaim for
performances throughout the
northeast and on tour in Bermuda
and the Caribbean.

The company of 24 young black
dancers made its official broad—
way review earlier this month
(March) to enthusiastic reviews.
The program ranged from neo--
classical to modern with the num-
bers choreographed by Mitchell
stressing ballet techniques.

When begun, only students from
the immediate surroundings in
New York were attracted and
only three of the original pupils
had any prior dance training. Now
three years later, there are more
than 800 enrolled, and the school
and the company are viewed as
one of the brightest developments
in the dance world in recent years.

The performance at Union is
scheduled for 8 pm. and is open
to the public with no admission

charged.

Ear To The Thunder

by Arlene Scheurer

‘Blues Magoos—Gulf Coast
Bound (ARCS—710) Blues Magooa
have been around a while and
they appear now to be gaining in
stature. This album explains why.
Their sound is full and refreshing,
and even, at times, overpowering.

I‘Tonight the Sky‘s About to
Cry" contains some insinuating,
Latin rhythm with a very catchy
melody) especially the chorus,
which has Peppy Thielhelm's
beautifully shouted vocal over a
chanted backdrop. The vibes solo
is relaxed. It is written in 3/11, tllt
unusual meter for blues.

“Can't Get Enough" builds in
layers from multi—rhytlimic per-
cussion, to bass, to full guitar, to
vocal and finally to ensemble with
Voices. Some cornball overdubbed
tenor by Pee Wee Ellis is sand
wiched between two vocals, fol-
lowed by an extended rhythm
orgy that goes nowhere. Ellis rev
turns with another boat on tenor
and comes out better, staying
away from the trite phrasing that
made up the totality of his earlier
effort. The piano illill vilir-s begin
to improvize together, btrt they
appear to be too concerned with
keeping out of ('ttL'li othvr's way
to do much. What comes next is a
series of soft tenor runs exchang-
ing with some of John Llicllri's
vibes, the latter l‘Vl'ltlilully going
otit on his own. Most notable is
the excellent guitar arrompruti»

burid that extra kirk

tiori, excellent meaty execution.

This Lutin—l)ltics»sou| group wins

some tough arrangements, and

The Mitgoos arc vaguely in llll'
tnold of Siiritrinrr and, Ill fact, by
Comparison come out the better
group. Their music docs not coir
Vey that canned and packaged
feeling tliiil Santana often does.
0n the contrary they are loose
rind vital. it will be interesting to
see this group as it grows and
grows.

Buddy Filer (‘lrtingca (Bell

CYAllO) This album is easy

lliitenlng, but still contains a srilis- ,

lying amount of integrity, 'l‘i'icky
devices are kept at. a minimum

and Fite‘s resourceful guitar is
kept in the forefront. There is
little evidence of commercial
shackcls and so the artist spins out
with bright improvizations with
apparent ease and comfort.

All material is pop in nature,
and the intent is the AM know-
nothing stations of America, but
Fite transcends that. His electric
lines seem almost to leap from the
record while the ballads, such as
“Raindrops” have a bittersweet
quality. I find his sound and
approach in “I Can't Get
Started" very similar to that of
Djiingo Rhcinhurt. He makes good
use of both short, but brisk runs,
long and Inngorously slow pris-
sages ending both with a quivering
trill on this song. There is only
bass and drums behind him and he
takes full advantage by stretching
out. When an orchestra is added,

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

as in “Have You Met Miss Jones“
it is unobtrusive taking a back seat
to Fite.

“Wave” seems quite suited to
Fite's style and he seems inspired.
He also shows little promise as a
writer of Changes. “Evil Ways"
has Fite‘s guitar ﬂoating softly
over a background of violins.

With few exceptions Changes is
a tristeful, unpretentious, jazzvpop
album. Buddy Fitc is obviously
put up to compete with many
guitarists attempting to fill the
gap left on the popular scene as a
result of the death of Wes Montv
gomery. He might not be able to
handle the competition, but. it's a
lot of fun listening to him try.
