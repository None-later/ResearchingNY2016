Empty Cradles in the Old Corral

 

Unemployment stalks the campus. Students search frantically for
any kind of part-time work, but there is no work. In fact, if things
don't. get better soon, many students may be forced into baby-sitting.

I hear you cry, “No! No!" But alas, my friends, desperate times
require desperate remedies. So if baby—sit we must, let us at least do it
scientiﬁcally.

To begin with, be sure you have the right equipment for the job
You will need three things: an orrlinary kitchen chair, a whip, aan a
pistol loaded with blank cartridges.

It is essential to dominate the baby from the very start. Never
show fear; they can smell it. Walk into the nursery boldly with your
head thrown back, singing a lusty song-~14“ Mnrscillnisr', perhaps, or
A Boy Named Sue. Stomp around the room several times. Crack your
whip. Fire your pistol. Keep it up till the lialiy knows you mean busi-
ness.
But terror, though necessary, is. not enough. To get the best re-
sults out of a baby, you must also make it love and trust you. This,
however, cannot be accomplished by firing your pistol, not even close
to the baby's ear. A new tar-tic is required: you must give it some fruit].

 

The baby's habitual diet It! a Vltlt’tlllﬂ whitc fluid called “formula.”
This should be served at the temperature of your wrist. In the event
you can't find the baby‘s iormulii, let it stick your wrist. It will never
know the difference, for the baby is basically an organism of dim iiith-
Iigence, though not without a certain pennant r-nnning.

After the baby has ingested the formula or siivltr-rl your wrist for
thirty minutes or so, it grows stuporrius anrl is ready to go to sleep - the
very thing you've been waiting for. You can hasten this do 'ralilc con-
dition by singing a lullaby. if yotr don't know any Inllaliit-s, make one
up. This is really quite simple. In a Iiillaliy thr- worrls arr- unimportant
since the baby, basically iin organism of dim intelligence as we have
seen; does not understand them anyhow. It is the sound which matters
in a lullaby, so use any old thing that comes iiiio your liearl, jiori so it
rhymes. For example, I have always had excellent luck with this one:

Gala sleep, my little infant,

Googoo, moanioo, pooporr, fn'ufrriil.

 

Next, arrange the baby in the position for slumber. .\ baby le't'pn
best on its stomach but, owing to its dim intelligence, it will keep turii-
ing itself over if not prevented. ’l‘hereforr-, to insure that it remains
prone, ii. in wine to pliice a soft, heavy object on its bar-k another
baby, if possible.

Once the Iiriby is asleep, remove your wrist from its mouth and
tiptoe softly from the room. closing the door tightly behind you so you
will not be disturbed by its crying. Then turn on the "on, go to
the refrigerator rind reward yourself for a job well (lune. Iii-ward your-
self how'.’ Surely you know . . . with Miller High Life Ber-r, of retinal!

That is litiw honest workers like you have been rewarding lhr-m-
aelvea for over lll') years. And no wonder! What better reward than
Miller's amber livelineius'.’ What higher bounty than Miller's lively
amberncsa'.’ What pleaaanier premium than Miller's breath—taking,
joy-making, soul-waking flavor? What welr-rimer bonus than that this
Miller, thir! heat of all priasible beers, this jewel iii the brewmaster's
art, should be available both in beautiful bottles of clear glass and in
cans which are equally wlnaome, though optique'.’

So alt back and enjoy the Miller you have so rir-lily earned. And
remember this when it corner: to baby-sitting: a good big man can
always lick a good little one.

*3 it it!

 

We, flu brewers of Miller High Life Beer, who bring you this column
through the iicfiool year, frankly take a dim View 0/ Max Shulman's advice
on baby-trifling. We do, however, find him extraordinarily sound in the
matter of beer.
