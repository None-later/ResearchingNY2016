‘The Administration Cares’

by .I. Stephen Flavin
A n ASP Feature

"A midst this cross concrete so
sterile,

The People tread, caring, loving,
so uirile.

In a modest office hidden deep
inside the Administration Buil-
ding, a staff of one is actively
attempting to reconcile the vast
array of day to day problems
arising between students, faculty,
departments and administrators or
any combination thereof.

Bette Herzog, formerly Execu-
tive Secretary to three SUNYA
Presidents in the last seven years,
is now in the role of campus
ombudsman. Her office is “a place
where people can come when
bogged down by bureaucracy,
when they have a complaint and
feel they aren‘t getting any re-
sponse or don’t know where to
turn, or to get things off their
chest."

“I care, and I will do some-
thing," Bette Herzog said. “I have
no responsibilities other than to
President Benezet. If a faculty
member comes in here with a
complaint about his chairman, I
don't defend the chairman, just
because he is an administrator."
Faculty members have
approached her in the past to
determine if they had a case to
dismiss their chairman, Bette's of-
fice can be used discretely with-
out making an official complaint.

"I see myself as being able to
bring people together," Bette con
tinued. "I've been in the univer-
sity seven years, all seven in the

 

President's office. I know a lot of
people and a lot about the various
departments and experimental
programs. I can bring people toge~
ther with common interests, goals
or problems readily."

Bette has handled many com-
plaints about course sign-ins. The
most frequent complaint regards
student and faculty parking. One
student had trouble determining
the total number of academic
credits allowed through collegi-
proficiency tests. In these instan-
ces, the problems are resolved by
directing Lllt' gricvcd one to the

propcr committee or offices.

Bette often finds the answer her-
self because “it's easier for me to
do it than others."

But, “some problems can‘t be
resolved; Sunken Gardens versus
housing for instance. This is out
of our hands. We can't switch
budget lines. Problems of budget-
ing have to be resolved in the
planning stage. "

The bi-wcckly campus forum is
a chance for problems to be aired
and ideas to evolve through con-
tact at all levels. Bette hoped that
interested pnrtics call her first so
that “I can arrange for people to
be there with the answers. So
many people complaint, but so few
people show up. The forum is a
chance for students and faculty to
find out if the president is human.
Al the forum and in my office
people are considered as indivi-
duals."

In the talking stages is a program
designed to establish more social
relationships between faculty and
students. "Knowing a member of
the facility or administration at a
social level is far different than
knowing them in the classroom.
Members of the faculty don’t have
to be married to invite students
into their homes. I suspect several
faculty members date students. I
think we are getting away from
the trend of ‘I am the teacher,
you are the student.‘ There is
nothing wrong with faculty (lilting
students."

Miss llcrzog would “love to see
more students coming in, even if
they just talk about parking or
food.

“The administrators
here. They care. I care."

Doctor Says Pill
Has No Side Effects

NEW ORLEANS AP -— Those reports from women of headaches,
nausea and nervousness caused by oral contraceptives are probably
more coincidental rather than direct drug effects, says a promincnl
scientist in the field of reproduction.

The true incidence of those reported side effects are far less than
generally believed, said Dr. Joseph Goldzieher of the Southwest
Foundation for Research and'Education of San Antonio, Tex.

Goldzieher made the comments in a report on a research paper to
the American Fertility Society here Thursday. He said the findings are
the result of a new type of clinical research with oral contraceptive
users. The side effects, the study shows, are present even without
medication.

The research study involved 398 women who were given treatment
with “pills.”

Some of the women were given dummy pills; some were given Ulll‘
of three oral contraceptives and some were given an estrogen-free
experimental “mini-pill" he said.

If you have doubts, consult
the local Better Business Bureau
for information on the organi-
zer’s past history. You can also
request an advisory opinion
from the: Civil Aeronautics
Board, 1825 Connecticul Ave,
NW, Washington, DC. 20009.
The request should include the
method of solicitation for the
charter, copies of solicitation
material, and requirements for
participation.

 

All of the women whe received the dummy pills and many using
active drugs were instructed to use other contraceptive protection.
This protected the women against pregnancy without revealing which
were on the dummy pills, Dr. Goldzieher said. Neither the pulli'nla'
nor the investigators knew who received what medication,

He said some of the conclusions reached were:

—That the frequency of headache, nervousness and (lt'pI'I'S-‘ﬂm'
durlnl: treatment with active drugs was the same as that for lin-
dummy pill.

i—That there was no perceptible difference in the systolic and

_And “1‘”- lvhc Proportion of women who gained five pounds or
more over a period of four months was the same whether they wcrl'

Goldzieher said the search data doesn't show that oral contract-pim-

But, he added, the studies do show that most of the comP'"'”‘-‘

Podium Extension

Seen

Feasible

by William Van Allen

West podium construction for next fall is still a

viable possibility, but on

a much reduced scale.

according to President Benezet. Although SUNYA's
construction fund requests of thirty million dollars
have been trimmed by two thirds, Walter Tisdale,
SUNYA campus planning chief, stated that ten
million dollars would still provide a sizeable ‘chunk'
of funds with which to start construction. If funds
are granted, work will commence this summer and

temporary structures will

be built. The completion

of these facilities will add financial leverage for

securing future grants to
portion of the project.

complete the remaining

In addition to explaining the future of the west
podium, President Benezet took the opportunity at
the March 30 press conference to reiterate the facts
of life of SUNY's budget squeeze and the effects on
SUNYA. He mentioned New York State's lack of
additional borrowing capacity. The threatened ter~
mination of the Milne campus school was also
mentioned but subsequent events have relieved the

situation temporarily.

Dissatisfaction with library service was voiced
and Benezet expressed sympathy if not encourage-

ment for a solution. The

president said that the

library must “make do" and try to make efficient

use of availablcpersonnel a

nd facilities.

Stein Encouraged

By SST Defeat

by Maida Oringher

Assemblyman Andrew Stein re-
turned to SUNYA on Tuesday
night, March 30 to address an
audience of about 50. The person
able, 26-year old, Manhattan-
Democrat was invited to speak on
the “Tyranny of 'I‘cchnology."

Reacting to the defeated bill
which would have funded the
Supersonic Transport plane, Stein
said, “the SST is not really
(lcad...thcrc are still several coun~
tries that are interested in it." He
stressed the importancu of com-
munity action. “The vote in the
Senate which defeated the SST
was encouraging because for the
first time puwcrful lobbyists were
overpchrod by the American
people.”

According to Stein, the McCar~
thy/Kennedy era also showed the
power of the public, especially of

college stiIdans. “That move-
mcnt," he said, “did more to
change the country than any

other movement, but the tenden-
cy among pcoplc in our genera-
tion is to want things quickly... a
sustained cfl’orl is parlimllnrly im—
portant on lhc environmental

issue because if we don'l stop

Ukrainian Students Protest
Suppression of Homeland

by Steve Salant

A group known as the Ukranian
Student Organization disrupted a
meeting in the Siena College audi-
torium to protest the oppression
of Ukranians in the U.S.S.R.

The Ukranian organization, un-
der the leadership of its president,
Martha Kuchar, met at Siena Col-
lege to confront the Ukranian
representative to the United Na-
tions (scheduled to appear) with
their grievances. The Ukranian re-
presentative did not show up.
"There were rumors of an auto
accident," said Miss Kuchar, In
the representative’s place, his
assistant was sent. The main topic
of his speech was Soviet peace
initiatives in the Middle East. Dur—
ing the question and answer per-
iod the Ukranian Student Organi-
zation (U.S.O.) dominated the
proceedings. The U.S.O. ques-
tioned his right to speak for the
Ukranian people, denounced the
censorship and arrests of many
Ukranian writers and “intellec-

tuals," and protested the forced
assimilation of Ukranians into
Russian society. They also quesv
tioned the right of constructTVe
criticism of the government in the
Soviet Union, where the Com-
munist Party is the sole definer of
what is "constructive." Miss
Kuchar said that only "obscure"
answers were given to their ques—
tions.

“As a result of this action,” the
president said, "many people be-
came aware of I‘the plight of the
Ukranian people in the U.S.S.R."

It must be pointed out that the
political aspect is only one part of
the organization's programs. The
organization is mainly centered
around the social and cultural
aspects of Ukranian life. It is
composed of students from the
colleges in the tri-city area, and is
open to all students who are
interested. Miss Kuchar said that

there is a large Ukranian popula-
tion in the tri-city area, especailly
in cities such as Cohoes and Troy.
"This organization," she said,
“was organized to help the stu-
dents get together." Whentalking
with this reporter, she stressed the
need for the preservation of the
"beautiful" culture that Ukra-
nians share. The president said
that the organization was a break
from the older generation in that
it is not an ethnocentric organiza-
tion, but, one which wants to
introduce others (besides Ukrani-
ans) to the culture. There will be
an exhibit of Ukranian art and
pottery on April 26 on campus
for anyone interested.

The organization's headquarters,
now at R.P.I., may be moved to
the state campus next year,
where, Miss Kuchar feels there
will be a great deal of interest and
participation.
