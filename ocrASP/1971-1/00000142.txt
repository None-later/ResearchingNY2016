Answer Yes or Ilo.

1. All yourfrlends have decided to
wear short shorts. You really don't
llke the look. Do you follow the '
gang?
Yes C] No (:1

2. You've lust met a marvelous,
interesting guy who's shorter than 1
you. Would you be embarrassed I
to go out with hlm? ‘
Yes I] No (:1

3- You've been Invited to dinner
agaln by a group of nice but
uninteresting people. Do you feel
obliged to accept?

Yes [I No D

4. All the charts say you're 10
pounds overwelght. You real line
and your clothes look well. Do
you diet anyway?

Yes (:1 No (:1

5. You appreciate all klnds of
music. Except opera. Do you think
you should listen anyway because
it's "the thing to do"?

Yes (:1 No C]

If you'lre answered "No" to three
or more questions, you really
rate as an independent thinker.
Another example of your in-
dependent thinklng: You use
Taman tampons.
Why Tampax tampons? Be-
cause, when you compare them
all, only Tarnan tampons give
you these advantages: Each
Tampax tampon comes In a.
silken-smooth container-applica-
tor. Both applicator and tampon
can be flushed away. No un-
wieldy stick or plastic tube to
dispose of.
Worn internally, Tampax tam-
pons are completely comfort~
able. Can't chafe, cause odor or
Irritate like bulky pads. Tarnan
(tampons. They make every day
of the year Independence Day.
