Third World Interaction

by Abdi A. Sheik-Abdi
An ASP Column

Exploitation of the Third World Peoples and Minority Groups
was to be the subject of a conference sponsored by Buffalo State
University on the weekend of April the 10th through the 13th.
More than twenty nations, among them three nationalities at
SUNYA, were represented. Ramesh Bakhru (India), Abdi Sheik-
Abdi (Somalia) and John Walker (USA) of the International
Studies and World Affairs program attended the conference on
behalf of Albany State.

During the first meeting, participants grappled with the question
of what constitutes the Third World. Some of us thought that
such a world must consist of predominantly non-white, poor, and
under-developed nations; mainly inhabiting the continents of
Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Some of us wanted to broaden
this definition to embrace any and all exploited peoples anywhere
in the world. By the end of the second day, however, we were still
at loss as to what constitutes the Third World.

The Afro-American delegation dominated the discussions to the
extent that the foreign students, who were by far in the majority,
found themselves the mute witness to an embarrassing confronta‘
tion between the vocal Blacks and half-a-dozen White Americans
at the conference. Things would have gotten out of hand it Dennis
Dean (Black) and John Walker (White-~SUNYA) had not proposed
the holding of sessions in sensitivity groups so these two hostile
factions might have a chance to know each other as individuals.

If the reporter of this column learned any lesson from this
conference, it is this: misunderstandings and misconceptions
among nations and races may be best dealt with through
interaction of free-thinking individuals. The clash of self-righteous
ideologies can hatch nothing better than half-cooked compromises
that are no sooner extracted than either forgotten or cast aside.
The wrangling participants redeemed themselves when they
decided to treat each other as individuals, and not as stereotypes.
Some of us have even formed friendships. Finally, we departed

the camp as individual men and women, and not in delegations.

Ed Degree Devalued

by Diane Margiore
Ari ASP Column
We are in serious trouble!! Something must be done immediate
ly to modify the Education Program at this school. Also, the

students taking these courses must do something.

As I wander around the campus at SUNYA, I see and hear many

students bragging about how they borrowed someone‘s paper and
got an “A,” or how they didn't read anything all year and did well

on the exam. I see them ripping pages out of library bonks,
particularly in the Education Periodicals. These things upsei ini-
because it shows how some people have no respect for cdilcation
at all. Many of these destructive people will be tomorrow's
“teachers,” if you want to call them that. How Clln they possibly
communicate the importance of knowledge to other sllltli-nls
when they have no respect for it themselves'.’How can they
motivate students when they don’t even write their own papers"
As far as I am concerned, their college diplomas and teacher's
certificates are meaningless. Anyone can go to college for four
years. get his degree on paper, and go out to teach. He may never
care about hos efficient he is. He might never Wonder if his pupils
understand him. It is so easy to be this kind of a teacher. Iii-'ll
probably get away with it in most school districts. ’I‘hiis. 1hr-
corrupted system of education continually poi'potratcs itself.

I have thought of some possible solutions to this growniu
problem. First of all, I do not believe that any student should lu-
allowcd to take an education course if he is not going in he in
teacher. There are too many students crowding tliu classrimiiis
already. My next solution seems fascistic, hut ii is lllt' ()Ill)
efficient mode of curtailing lhc flaws in the syslcm, Applimnils
for education courses must be screened by a psycliiiliigisi (II' .I
very perceptive person who will interview him and ll'ill' down Illi‘
facades and “good image" the student will lry to portray. 11‘ ii hzi~
worked in the Soviet Union, it might work hcrc. 'l‘hi- Sm-ii-i
system of education is superior to ours for this very reason.

Unl‘orlunalcly, these creatures called "students" hthl' l()\\'l‘l‘t‘(l
the value of education, not only in the Ed (leill'llnL'lll. liui iii all
areas. Some of you may argue with inc and say that the i'oiirsi-s
are too irrelevant to put any work into. I have an answer for you!
Relevancy is all up to you. You must go out and try In ri-lali-
whatever you have learned. Of course, I will admit that n li-iiclii-r
can help you and the structure of the course can help. This is
being worked out now and it will take time. But, i'i-mi-mhi-r. ihi-
reason that you cursi- out your boring, rigid-minded iiiiiclii-rs is
lhal they are like you. They have already decided that ihv coursi-
is irrelevant and they don't do ii goddamn [hing Ill lllllllYilll‘
anyone.

These students who don't care almul learning an» llil‘ pi-irpli'
that will soom have very important positions. Home of my pi-i-rs
may he teaching my own children They will he influencing lllt'
youth of America, which is “)0 future. The radicals and liberals
who clamor for more relevancy should realize thal the only way a
teacher can try to make his students more open-minded is if m is
open-minded himself. He has to interest them, otherwise llil‘)' Will
be apathetic and this country will stagniilc more than it already
has. Doesn't it scurc you?
