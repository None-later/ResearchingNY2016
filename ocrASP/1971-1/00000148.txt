The Preem'ng of America

Recent polls taken on American campuses lry Time and News-
week have revealed unexpected, aan most welcome, results. Both mag-
azines found that today's undergrruluaies, far from boiling with revo-
lutionary fervor, are just as torpid as everyone else.

Joyous tidings, of course, but I in list any tlnit I was never worried.
Sure, life-styles are a little difiercnt on campus these days; neverthe-
less, I've always felt that down deep this generation clings to the same
solid values that sustained all their predecessors.

In my own college days, for example, the most popular aid to socia-
bility on campus was precisely whiit it is today: Miller High Life Beer.
And, mind you. my college days were a good Iorig time ago. I got my
B.A. way back in 1908. (My alma mater, incidentally, was a school
I’m sure you all know—the Wyoming College of Belles Lettres and
Commercial Baking, from whence, as you are undoubtedly aware,
came a veritable host of graduates who later achieved stardom in the
breadstulis game~men like Darrell J. Inskip who invented rye bread
with caraway seeds; Irving ’1‘. Whitsun who invented the toothpick,
thus milking it possible to eat rye bread with caraway seeds; Sol Bagel
who invented the permanent doughnut which bears his name; and
many, many others. indeed. the list would be far longer if the college
had stayed in business but, alas, it was killed by mold in 1921.)

But I digress. Even in lllllil, I say. Miller High Life was a campus
favorite. In fact. it was popular even before 1908, for Miller has been
delivering flavor to discriminating Americans for over 115 years! And
today it is more widely appreciated than ever! And why wouldn't it
be? In 115 years no other brewer has ever duplicach Miller's flavor.
Oh, they've tried to copy Miller, you can hot, but a fat lot of good it
did them. Since the Very beginning Miller's superb lircwing formula
has been one of the best kept secrets on earth. It has nchr been known
to more than one man— Miller's chief brewmaster
been kept inside a hollow mountain in downtoer Milwaukee.

But I digress. The polls, I say. have provud that today's college
student. though he dresses in a homespun robe and wears chicken
bones in his ears, cherishes the same dreams and drives that students

 

To illustrate, I recently visited a student commune at a prominent
Southern university (Michigan State). Now. I’ll admit it didn't look
much like one of your old-fashioned fraternity or sorority houses. First
of all, there was no house. Everyone slept in trees. except for one girl
who made a hammock out of a discarded bra. In the second place,
meals were not served: they were trapped. And in the third place, the
kids didn't talk about the usual things like 1110. sex. truth and beauty.
In fact, they didn't talk. They just sang "0m," holding the note till
they hyperventilated and toppled over In a faint.

But appearances are only appearances, as I discovered when I

"What are you studying?" I asked one young man.
"My navel," he said, and I was vastly reassured, for we all know

"What. do you want to be when you finish school?" I asked

“A druid," he said, and again I was reassured. for as anyone on
Wall Street can tell you, Ioreat ecology Is the coming thing.
“Do you believe In women's liberation?" I asked a girl.

“I'm a boy.“ was the answer.

And so it went. And so I say to you again: worry not. Take away
the beards, the bonds, and the buckskin. and you've got. the same lov-
able freckle-faced achievers you always had. only naked.

We at Miller High Li/r arc bruwara, not racial scientists, but this
much we know: whatever may be changing in this country, it certainly is
not taste buds. We will continue, therefore, to bring you flu some delicious
