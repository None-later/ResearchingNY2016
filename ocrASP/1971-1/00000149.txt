JAZZ SCENE...

 

 

by Robert Rosenblum

Now that jazz musicians have
come to the realization that the
system keeps'them from distribut-
ing their records in an orthodox
manner, many more ambitious
musicians are distributing their
own records and selling them by
mail. The following are two such
musicians.

Clifford Thornton appears to be
rising into permanence in the
avante garde (which really isn't
prominence at all) as a result of
his association with tenor saxo-
phonist Archie Sheppe. The at-
bum Freedom and Unity (Third
World 9636) by the Clifford
Thornton New Art Ensemble is
one that has been produced by a
cooperatiVe group of avante garde
musicians.

As an example of the “Now
Thing” in jazz this record is quite
unusual. I say that because the
compositions and arrangements
are much more of interest than
any individual soloists. Thornton,
who plays valve trombone, has a
very limited range, hardly any
technique and only occasional
sparks of imagination (as on
“Exosphere") and “0.0T.”

Karl Berger is much more of a
technician on vibes, but musically
he is quite monotonous, running

much of the same problem, but.
comes on strongly on “Exo-
sphere" using the speed of Charlie
Parker and the tonal quality of
Ornette Coleman.

The bassists and drummer are by
far and away the standouts on the
record. Harold Avent has both
power and sensitivity and his use
of the bass drum for accentuation
is particularly commendable.
Tyrone Crabb plays some base
that was obviously copied from
ex-Coltrane bassist Jimmy
Garrison, whi is also recorded here
(on “O.C.T."). Don Moore's work
on bass lends strong support and
he, more than anyone. holds the
performances together as a cohes-
ive whole.

The ensemble work is beautiful,
though, and the composers create
some of the most beautiful group
textures l‘vc heard in the avant
garde. It is here where Thornton ’s
bitter sound fares best, “15th
Floor" is the most notable. It is
sort of blues like in texture
though not in form.

This record can be purchased
only by writing Clifford Thorn-
ton, 109 Broadway, Brooklyn,

VAPB Television Network

Now Available To Coﬂeges

The APB Television Network,

the nation's only network which‘

is not governed by FCC regula-
tions, controlled by sponsors, or
limited by programming aimed at
the lowest common denominator,
is now accepting afﬁliations on
college campuses across the coun-

try. The network has been formed 

in protest to a twenty year legacy
of programs like “The Beverly
Hillbillies" and "Let's Make a
Deal” from the commercial net-
works.

Among the programs supplied to
afﬁliates during the fall, 1971
season, will be the "New Con-
sciousness" series, which focuses
on the social issues that most
concern today’s young people.
These programs have all been pro-
duccd specifically for the APB-TV
Network and will avoid all censor-
ship problems by being distri-
buted on the new cassette televi-
sion medium. Included in the
series are an examination of re-
pression in America that features
Frank Mankicwicz and Abbie
Hoffman, an exploration of the
consumer movement with Ralph
Nader and his Raiders, an analysis
of the nation's drug problems by
Woodstock Festival physician Dr.
William Abruzzi, a journey with
Bernadette Devlin on her recent
US. visit, and overview ofthe
ecology movement with Walter
Hickel, and a feature on the hu'
man body that includes the first
televised abortion.

Afﬁliation with the APB-TV
Network will also enable cam-
puses to choose from cassette
recordings to major rock concerts,
underground films, top sports at-
tractions, contemporary drama,
and instrucitonal programs. APB
is currently negotiating with sever-
al national advertisers for spon-
sorship of some of these pro-
grams. Campuses that pay the
original affiliation fee will e re-
ceiving sponsored cartridges free
of charge. Sponsorship is accepted
only after completion of the pro-
gram, and will have no influence
on content.

Featured on many of the pro-
grams will be personalities from
the American Program Bureau lec<
ture agency, the speakers who
have been most in demand for
in-person campus appearances.
The list ranges from Ralph Nader,
Bernadette Devlin, Paul Ehrlich,
and Julian Bond to Abbie Hoff-
man, Janc Fonda, Dennis Hopper,
and Al Capp. These speakers, who
have often complained of being
limited to safe topics when they
appear on network talk shows,
will now enjoy the same freedom
on the APB‘TV Network as they
have on the college lecture plat-
form. The television network has
been totally integrated into APB
President Robert. P. Walker's con~
Cept o“The Fourth Media, the
most direct and unfiltered source
of information available to to»
day's students. "

This unrestricted programming
is made possible by the use of the
new CBS/EVE. video cassette
system. Pre-recorded programs on
seven-inch cartridges areplaced in
Motorola Teleplayer, about the
size of a record player, and played
through any ordinary television
set on the campus. A single Tele-
player can feed adozen TV sets in
one location, and it can also be
directly connected to a school‘s
closed circuit video system. The
cassette programs are owned by
afﬁliated schools and will form a
permanent library of video infor-
mation which can be a constant
reference source. Unlike film or
video tape, the cassettes can he
played more than a thousand times
with no deterioration of video
quality.

Because of the portability and
ease of operation of the Motorola
'I‘eleplaycr, programs can be
shown at any location on campus
where there is a television set.
Campus affiliation can be ob
tained by the student union, the
library, student government, for
ternaties the college newspaper, or
any interested organization
Unlike the broadcast. nclwurks,
the APB-TV Network operates un-
der the philosophy tht television
is more than a one-way medium
and that viewers should have a say
in determining program subjects
and content. '

SUNYA SPRING WEEKEND
FEATURES CONCERTSIILMS

The First Annual Spring
Weekend will be held at the Al-
bany State Campus from Thurs-
day, April 22 to Sunday, April 25.

Cir-Chairmen Roy Rosenberg
and Baena Endick described the
purpose of this event as follows:

"During the spring, our school
has never had a large scale, organ-
ized weekend, especially for the
students of SUNYA. It is really
great that when it gets warm out,
kids come out of hibrination and
‘(lo their thing.’ in informal gath-
crings.

But we feel that an organized
weekend of planned eVents in
which kids can come and go as
they please without actually taxv
ing their wallets can only add to

making springtime at Albany

State more enjoyable,"

for the weekend is as follirWs:

Tennis Team at 3-1

by Dick Sexton

With what may be the strongest
tennis squad ever at Albany State
the Great Danes entered the 1971
spring campaign with hopes for a
great season. It will certainly be a
trying one, with the schedule call-
ing for 13 matches within a four
week period, nine of which will be
played on the road.

At this point in the season, the
team's record stands at three wins
against one loss. The team fared
very well in its season opening
match against Rl’l, winning eight
of nine matches. On April 7, the
team traveled downstate to tho
New York-Long [slum] area. The
Danes were victorious in the
southern campaign against Brook-
lyn College with the final SCUI‘l'
6-1. The last two doubles matches
were called because of darkness.
The following day, however, the
Danes were just shaded by a
strong Stony Brook squad, losing
the match 5-4, This past Tuesday
at home, the Coast Guard Aco~
dcmy was subdued by Albany,
6-3.

After this season, the three top
ranked players on the team grad-

uate. They are, in order of rank,
Ken Rishman, Dave Hawley, and
Ted Rosenberg. However, the four
remaining players are sophomores
and promise to pick up a good
deal ofthe slack.

The team suffered an unfortunte
loss when Dave Hawley developed
leg trouble early in the season.
it’s uncertain, at this point,
whether he will be able to return
to action this season. Hawley‘s
two year varsity singles mark is
192. However, the rest of the
team seems to have been able to
make up the loss somewhat. After
the first four matches, individual
statistics are as follows: Ken Fish-
man is undefeated at 4-0, Rosen-
berg is 2-2, Eric Carlson 3-1, Chris
Burke 3— 1, and Harold Forrest and
John Buffone are both 22.

In the eyes of Coach Hatha-
way, the team is playing “up to
par,"

Their next home match takes
place oanuesday, April 20 at
3:30 against New Paltz. If the
team can stay healthy and con-
tinue to play "up to par" an
NCAA bid could very well await
them.

R u . g A .
The Albany State trackmen made a smashing success of their 1971
debut Wednesday afternoon by completely dominating the triangular
meet held with Boston State and Westﬁeld State. The Great Danes
amassed a total of 112% points to Boston State's 34V: and Westﬁeld

State's 25 points.
The meet took place at home amidst a thirty-five degree temper-

ature and a gusty wind. Nevertheless, Albany took first in all but four
events, with its strength and depth very much evident in the ﬁeld events
Seriors Don Van Cleve and Dec Grilli placed one and two respectively
in both the shot put and discus. Dave Reynolds won both the high
jump and triple jumps; Saul Moshenberg took the long jump; and
Sophomore Tommy Moore came on top in the pole vault. Elsewhere
in the ﬁeld, Ross Andersen, last year’s MVP, threw the javelin 160
feet for a first. In both the long jump and triple jump Albany swept
the first three places.

0n the track, the Great Danes also placed the first three men in the
100 yard dash, won by Cliff McCarg~ and in the 880 with Pete Payne
taking a first. Other winners were school record holder Sal Rodriguez
in the 4110, Arnold Shell in the mile, and John Comerford in the two

mile.
The win was Albany State‘s 16th straight meet victory dating back

to the 1969 season. The team looks healthy and very strong al'eady, a
good Sign after just the first meet. Next week THE ASP SPORTS will
have an exclusive interview with Coach R. Keith Munsey, the driving
force behind the team's success, to see what he thinks of the
possibility of his team finishing undefeated, and also its possible
future in this year's NCAA post season affairs.
