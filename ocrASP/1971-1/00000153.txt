by Dave Fink

Old Man Winter seems to be
leaving Albany after an extended
stay. Nobody is really sorry to see
him go. Certainly not the Varsity
Lacrosse team, but they didn't sit
around waiting for him to split.
They left themselves.

The squad has won their first
two league games and it seems as
if their trip south, while it didn't
do anything for their season’s
record, has provided an oppor-
tunity to sharpen their team work
and individual skills against very
tough competition.

The Danes began the trip in
Maryland against Towson State.
Towson‘s early start (weather-
wise) proved to be a decisive
factor as they beat State 13-6.
The game was pretty even after
the first quarter when Coach
Robert F‘ord's team fell behind to
a 7-1 deficit. Stops in New Jersey,
where they bombed Fairleigh~
Dickinson, III-'2, and Long Island
where they ran into a well-drilled

C.W. Post team losing 12-2, pre-
ceded the Danes' opener last Mon-
day against tough Brockport.

It was hard to predict just what
would happen against the West-
erners. State had not looked very
impressive down south. Some-
thing seemed to be missing. yet
with the fine personnel the team
possesses, itseemed to be just a
matter of time before they would
break out of things and start
playing up to their potential.
Monday proved to be the clay.
Breaking out to an early lead,
State whipped Brockport 11-11.
The visitors were never really in
the game. Led by senior attack-
man Larry Smith (11 goals), the
Stickmen literally ran Brockport
off the field. Torn Mullin added 2
goals, one on a solid breakaway,
while sophomore midfielder
Barry Sadoff continued his fine all
around play at both sides of the
field, scoring in his fourlh consec-
utive game. Middle Jeff O'Donnell
also gave the visitors no rest as he

Done Nine Undefeated; Open at Home Tuesday

by Robert Mirett

Albany State‘s baseball team
will be looking towards improving
their impressive record of 3 wins,
no losses and a tie this week,
when they meet New Paltz in the
Danes home opener.

The club has already posted
wins against RPI, Stony Brook,
and Siena, and played Brooklyn
to a tie. In the team‘s first win,
Senior lefty Hi Doolittle, (»l--l last
season), pitched a complete game
as State lead all the way enroute
to a 5-3 victory.

Against Brooklyn, Sophomore
southpaw, Nick Aseienzo (3-3 in
’70) went all six innings as the
game was called on account of
darkness with the teams dead-

State University at Albany will
re-join the State University of
New York Athletic Conference
(SUNYAC) this fall. Albany was a
charter member when the con
ferenee was formed in 19:39, then
withdrew in 19611 due to lrnvcl
and scheduling problems.

Athletic director Alfred I'. Wer-
ner said Albany decided to apply
for re-admission so that the uni-
versity could become affiliated
with a playing conference and be
eligible for post-season champion-
ship play. Its application was
accepted unanimously.

"We feel that conl'ercncv mem»
bership provides added incentivr-
and rewards for students compel»
ing in intercollegiate athletics."
Werner stated. “The reasons for

locked at three runs apiece. At
one point, State had been down
by a 3-1 score.

In the second victory of the
season, the Danes, behind Frosh
Kevin Quinn, came up with four
runs in the ninth as they whipped
Stony Brook, 8-2. Last Tuesday,
in their fourth straight road game,
the State nine literally “walked”
all over Siena, by a Isl-3 margin.
In that game, Albany came back
from a 3-1 deficit to take a slim
-l-ll edge into the eight, in which
they scored 10 big runs. State
combined eight walks, three hits
and a Siena error to pick up its
eighth inning runs. The big hit in
the frame was 21 bases loaded

In the hitting department, Soph
Jack Lealy is carrying a healthy

baseman Rick Ward is four for

only Jim Lee has hit a SUNYA

demic and athletic ability.

Merlin Hathaway, Albany 's vete-
ran tennis coach and former

lll organizing the league in 1959.
He served as its first president.

“We formed SUNYAC to bolster
the status of state institutions and
to standardize their athletic poli-
cies.” Hathaway recalls. “Albany

involvvd in making a long trip,
particularly in baseball, then hav-
ing the game rained out. Eco-
nomically, 11 just wasn't feasible.”

Now divlsmn play and con-
ference meets have relieved the
trawl problems. Albany's admint
stratum, coaches, and athletes are
looking forward to entering
SUNYAC competition in all
sports beginning in September.

State Golfers,
by Lawrence H. Pohl

Dave Blaker was the Great Dane medalist in the Albany State
Linksmen's first two meets, the first of which was a tri-meet loss to
defending ECAC champion Central Connecticut, 5-2, and top rated
Oswego, 6-1; and the second a 5-2 victory over Hamilton College at
Winding Brook Golf Course. Blakely, whom Coach Richard “Doc”
Sauers stated as having "established himself as our solid number one
man," shot an 80 and an 83 in the opening meets.

The other starting Great Dane duffers are. in order of position on
the team: Frank Stamilio, John Heher. Werner Kolln, Brian O'Connell
and Brian Williams.

Sauers mentioned the fact that the weather has not been very
favorable for practice but doesn't look to that factor for an excuse.
“The same problems are faced by all the teams so one can't blame
that." As far as the effect of the shortened season on the team's
performance is concerned, Sauers notes that “things will be a little
cramped but 1 still think we have a very good chance of having a

winning season.'
The Great Danes' next meet is an away match with New Paltz
tomorrow.
