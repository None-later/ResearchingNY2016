by Stephen Aminoff

Living Theatre is the rather pre-
tentious title given to certain
works of stage whereb the stage
itself can successfully disintegrate.
If done with care, a performance
with sufﬁcient charisma may mo-
tivate an audience to give up its
role as spectator and to become
one with the experience.This is
certainly an ambitious under-
taking and, accordingly, an often
unsuccessful one.

However, for some joyous mo-
ments at the Art Gallery on Satur-
day, the lights Were shining on a
fabulous company of dancers, and
the general frenzy they were able
to inspire. A combination of pro-
fessional and amateur dancers

Superstar Su percedes'

staged a production of “Jesus
Christ, Superstar" to the delight
of everyone present.

In what became more of a rock
ballet set to the music of rock
opera, a brilliant Black dancer
from Harvard made his debut to
SUNYA in a superlative blend of
poetic dance essence. His move-
ment added a vivacious brashness
to the humbleness enerally por-
tra ed by the role 0 Jesus.

owever, what was to make
“Jesus Christ, Superstar" really
work, was the extent to which the
audience became absorbed into
the presentation. The perfor-
mance ended to the tune of hun-
dreds of dancing bodies “doing
what felt good.“

Love. LifeAncl “Hair”

by Rachel Lamar

Hair is a four letter word. It is
also the best thing to hit Albany
in at least three years.

The total effect of the play is
summed up in the cast. l have
never seen twenty five people
enjoy themselves so much on a
stage (or off it) in my life. Even
the original Broadway cast didn't
have this much enthusiasm.

Although the “hero” is Claude
Hooper Bukowski, played as an
innocent child of peace by Claude
Carlsen, the show was stolen by
Berger, who, disguised as Richard
Spiegal, fought a never ending
battle for truth, justice, and freak-
ing out everyone around him.
While Claude's voice was clear and
pure, going well with his “little-
boy" image, Berger's exuded life
and was filled with a coarse power
which suited his on-stage personal-
ity. Here is a man of whom it can
be truly said, “he knows how to
sell a song."

Two more actors worthy of
mention are Tom Eure (Woof)
and Michael Rhone (Hud). Woof
is the child crying “love me," He
was one of the few people to get
Friday night‘s dead head crowd to
react. I found myself waiting
for his entrances, and l was never
disappointed.

Now for the ladies. The three
which i remember most vividly
were Sheila (Candi Earloy), Jean-
nie (Linda Rios) and Crissy (Joyce
Macek). While the solos done by
Sheila (“Easy to Be Hard") and
Crissy (“Frank Mills"~ in which
Joyce sounded amazingly likc
Shelly Plimpton, the original (Tris-
sy) were among the best received
in the show (and among the better
known) it was qunnic who capti-
vatcd the audience. She gloriously
underplaycd the role, and both
her gestures and facial expressions
showed her conflict bctwoun lov-
ing Claude and trying not to show
it, to remain the cynic.

The music is known to every-
one, and the tribe does a magnifi-
cent job. The band is also supcrlu-
tivc.

The only problem was the
audience. Friday night's crowd
was about 65% older people,
either there to sec the (shock!)
nude scene or to be among the
“first nighters." They just didn‘t
understand it, and couldn't really
relate.

Anyway...lluir is a four lctter
word. So is life, So is love, And
life and love is what Hair is all
about.

SUN Y Cuts Enrollment

2,000 Students Denied
Study Abroad Program Curtailed 

Sabaticals Eliminated

The State University of New York will be formed to deny admission next fall to at least. 2,000
prospect.ch students it originally had planned to enroll, as the result ofbudgct reduetions announced by
the Rockefeller administration Monday.

The governor's budget director, Richard L. Dunham, said the enrollment goal of 140,000 students at 32
state-operated campuses will be reduced by at least 2,000. The figures do not apply to the 38 locally
sponsored community colleges within the SUNY system.

Governor Rockefeller had proposed in his budget recommendations in February to increase the
enrollment by approximately 10,000 students, or almost eight per cent. The enrollment increase will now
be held to 8,000.

in addition, llicru will be no increase of faculty members and other SUNY personnel to accommodate
the extra students.

Dunhum's announcement included the observation that "increased class sizes will prevail in all of the

story.
