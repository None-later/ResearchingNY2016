Anti—Semitism is not a new phenomenon.
It has developed into a science over the last
four millenia. Yet, when it occurs anew
somewhere on the globe, one tends to be
saddened if not horriﬁed.

This time, it is the Soviet Union which
receives the Anti-Semitic Award of the Year.
Not that this sickness is alien to Eastern
Europe. To the contrary, the Slavic peoples
can proudly claim that they were the first in
European- history to so malign and persecute
a people, the Jews. It is not altogether
certain, however, that the people of Eastern
Europe (the Soviet Union and her satellites)
have ever come out of the Dark Ages which
was the era of the birth of Anti~Scmitism in
Europe. '

Despite the economic progress the Soviet
Union has made in the distribution and
augmentation of goods, she has not over-
come the social prejudices and political
intolerance of the Czarist regimes. To the
Soviet Jew, therefore, the October Revolu-

tion has no meaning. His life is still in
jeopardy and his right to be himself is still
viciously denied. Russian Judaism is thus
being threatened by extermination.

To ask why the Soviet Union has deter-
mined it necessary to forcefully assimilate a
whole people is to ask why anti-Scmitl'sm
exists. The age-old political benefit of
“scapegoatism” is obvious. When the Five
Year Plan fails, it is natural to expect
Brezhnev to shift the blame from the Presi-
dium to a despised national minority.

Unfortunately for the Jews living in the
USSR, the blatant Soviet anti-Scmitism that
we are now witnessing does not promise to
die. The day when we can finally herald the
demise of antiScmitism will indeed signal
the maturation of the human race. But for
those who do not believe that the Messiah

.has cvcr conic or ever will conic, the Day of

Reckoning for the bigots of the world might
seem light years away.

Poor Judgement

To the Editor:

On Tuesday, April 20, an incident. occurred during
an AMlA softball game which we feel significantly
shows the luck of organization which has plagued

this program since the start of this year.

We feel the failure of 11 smooth system has been
caused by the inconsistency of its director who is
Michael Yager. Without. regard to the participants,
he has single handedly thrown AMlA into complete

chaos

by David Kopilow

The opposition of most liberal and radical stu-
dents to American policy in Vietnam is based
primarily on two considerations: the United States
has supported a series of unrepresentative, rc-
prcssive, regimes in South Vietnam and US. policy
in Vietnam has caused the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of civilians und turned literally millions
of Lttolinns, Cambodians, and South Vietnamese
into homclss, pcnniless refugees.

In response to US. policy, liberul students helped
organize the Kennedy-McCarthy campaigns of 1‘.)th
and the historic Moralorium in October 1969,
Although neither resulted in an end to the war, both
contributed to the growth of antivwar sentiment in
the country and thus ch lo important changes in
US. policy--ttn end to the bombing of North
Vietnam, the offer of a standstill cease-fire and the
current troop withtlruwls. But the Nixon Adminis-
tration persists in its support of Thieu-Ky and
seemingly slill harbors the illusoryhope of military

end to the killing and the South Vietnamese people
free to choose their own destiny. Unlike most of the
leaders of the Moratorium and Kennedy-McCarthy
campaigns, they are committed to a victory of the
Vietcong which would mean more bloodshed and
the imposition of a totalitarian regime even more
brutal than the Thieu-Ky military clique.

On April 24, NPAC and the PCPJ are co-
sponsoring non-violent demonstrations in Washing-
ton and Sun Francisco. Similar demonstrations in
November 1969 and April 1970 failed, Gallop polls
showed that they had precisely the opposite effect
thtm intended. They failed because they convinced
no one to oppose the war but due to their politics
(intense anti-Americanism, implicit and occasional
outright support of the NLF) they did convince the
undecided and wavering to support the Adminis-
tration in power‘s handling of the war. The April 24
demonstration will be no different.

Unfortunately, the demonstrations plnnm-(l after
the 2~lth promise to be worse——much worse. The first.
of these disruptive demonstrations is scheduled for
April 26410, the second for May 11-4. The latter
will be held in conjunction with the Ann Arbor
Student. and Youth Conference which will present
the “People’s Pcucc Treaty" on May lst. ’l‘his

won 30% of the vote in the last election, may not
participate in the election. And point 8 calls on
both the Americans and the Vietnamese to respect
the independence and neutrality of Laos and Cam-
bodia, but since the North Vietnamese denies it has
troops in either country, accepting this provision
would mean giving Laos and Cambodia to North
Vietnam.

Equally important, it is highly WNW,
dishonest, and implicitly anti-democratic for its
supporters to claim that this is a treaty between the
peoples of South Vietnam, North Vietnam, and the
United States. It is impossible to know whether or
not the people of North Vietnam agree with its
provisions since their government allows them no
democratic rights. Most Americans would reject
such an outright Capitulation to North Vietnamese
NLF demands. And most authoritative sources agree
that only 15-25% of South Vietnamese want the
NLF to rule their country.

It is particularly unfortunate that these demon-
strations are being held at this time. For almost
every poll shows that. the anti-war movement has
finally won the battle for public opinion. Most
Americans now want the U.S. to end the war, or at
least its involvement. in it us soon as possible. But.

The incident that brings us to write this letter
happened at six o'clock yesterday afternoon when
Mr. Ynger called a League I encounter between ’I‘XO
and Four Years After. The point of calling it game
which was set up before the season began, is a
regulation which we are in favor of, but. not by a
person who was in no way involved in the game
itself. The umpire of the game (lid not make the
initial call; Mr. Yttgcr used his superiority to be the
sole judge. The fact that. the game started at lcusl 15
minutes lute was nol. brought to Mr. Yugcr‘s
attention, nor was be correct in assuming that it. was
six o‘clock, when it was really 7 minutes prior. The
game was in the next. to last inning and was moving
quite fast. The umpire even said the game COULD
continue as he knew the facts and wanted to give
both teams a fair shake.

We feel Mr. Ynger has not. fulfilled his obligations
as the AMIA director. Since AMlA is funded by the
students, there is no reason why one mun should
put it upon himself to control the entire program.

The total disillusionment. with AMIA is now in the
open and should be dealt. with immediater before

Education Response
To the Editor:

Reading Misti Mnrgiorc's recent column I was in
agreement in fact. but disappointed in the scope.
Granted many of education students are not all they
should be, howuwr a more uppr()prii|l.i' allegation is
many of our students are not all they could be! To
hold our education students to a narrow douva
standard, subjectiVely configured like all norms, Is
the GPIl-mne of the intellectual hypocrisy thul
[Harmonies the minds of those who see teachers as at
target for pent up ugrcxsion (the type of attitudi-
which hurt made the title Lunchi-r u euphemism it.

Nixon's currth Vietnamizntion policy is not a
people‘s policy-«mt- that will lend to a negotiated
settleman to the ware-rather it. is a policy fora
protracted war which the Nixon administration
hopes Thicu antl Ky will win. We havo no choice
then bul to continue our work for a change in US.
policy for a democratic and peaceful solution to the
war.

Many liht'ral students think they can do this by
participating in one or all of the demonstrations
planned for April 2-l-Murch 5. We tlisngrcc. The
groups behind these demonstrations -- The ’l‘rot-
skyists in the National Peace Action Coalition and
tho Sllldl'lll Mobilitntion Committee, and the New
Lel'tisls (untl a good number of old communists) in
the People‘s Coalition for Peace and Justice v- are
for thcwithdrawnlof US. troops from Vietnam, to
be sure. We oppose US. policy because we want. on

South Vietnamese pro-Vietcong students includes
every importunl. demand of thc NLF Front, the
Provisional Revolutionary Government. of Vietnam.
Point 1 of this treaty calls on the U.S. to withdraw
its troops front South Vietnam, but il. makes no
such demand of North Vietnam. Point 3 called for
an immediate cease-fire between the Us. and the
N.L.F., but not between the NLF and the South
Vietnamese government. or the anti-Communist
third force in Vietnam. Presumeubly, the fighting
then will continue to thtl bitter end. Point 6 calls on
the Vietnamese (which Vietnamese is never mude
clear) to form a provisional coalition goVernmcnt to
organize an election (with no international impartial
supervision) but implied that 'l‘hicu nnd Ky, who

the fact that a majority of the people oppose the
war does not mean that. Nixon will change his
policy. In fact, he won't. unless he sees this anti-war
sentiment. us a political trend. But the spring
demonstration will minimize that trend -- because
they like similar demonstrations will make many
Americans opposed to the anti-war movement than
to the war. If that. happens Nixon can continue to
do what he wants in Indochina.

On the other hand, if antirwur students help build
a majority movement which can defeat. Nixon in
1972, then Nixon will either have to change his
policy or fuce defeat in the next election. We urge
all anti-war students to join with the YPSL in
building this movement now.
