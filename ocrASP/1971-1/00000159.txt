Black - Spring Weekend

by Stephen Aminoff

The purpose of this article is to
reassure people that if you hang
out this campus long enough, nice
things can be done in an attempt
to expand your cultural con-
sciousness. A new entity on this
campus, a schoolwide Spring
Weekend complete with festivities
at lower prices than you can
probably see them anywhere, will

'Iling oi tellists’
to Perform

This weekend Music Council
will present the last two concerts
in the Spring 1971 concert series.
On Friday April 23 at 8:30 pm in
the Main Theater of the Perform-
ing Arts Center (at the State
UniVersity) The Tip of Hie Iceberg
will be performed. The Tip of the
Iceberg is a multi-media event
concc.ved by Franklin Morris,
Director of the Electronic Studio
at Syracuse University, It is a
continuous perfomance mixing
films, slides, electronic music and
live action.

On Sunday, April 25 at 3:00
p.m. in the Performing Arts Cen-
ter Main Theater Janos Starker,
world-renowned cellist will per-
form works of Bach, Franck,
Debussy, and Boccherini, among
others. The Chicago American has
called him “king of ccllists." Born
in Budapest in 1924, Janos
Starker was introduced to music
by his parents at a Very early age
and when he was scvvn decided to
become a ccllist. He attended the
Franz Liszt Academy and after
finishing his studies he held the
chair of first ccllist with the Burla-
pcst Opcra anti Philharmonic
Orchestras. He left his native
country in 1046 because he “did
not like the atmosphere," After
two years of concerlizing in vari-
ous European countries, he came
to the United States where he has
since made his home.

After having spent a number of
years as solo cellist of some of the
major American orchestras,
Starker decided to devote himself
to appearances as soloist only. He
has toured all over the United
States and lanada, Europe, the
Far East- acclaimedchrywht-re as
one of the greatest cellists of our
time.

converge with Black Weekend to
form a blend of musical essences
guaranteed to provide some inter-
esting moments for the contem-
porary music devotee. Three pre-
mier examples of their respectiVe
tastes; Alex Taylor, Johnny Win-
ter, and Pharoah Saunders;are set
to perform at various parts of our
school, on the the weekend of
April 22-23-24, and SUNYA may
never be the same.

So it‘s a mild Thursday evening
and, beneath a star-cluttered sky
you sit with a jug of wine in one
hand and a few blades of grass in
the other as Alex Taylor, of that
heralded Carolina family, bids
you listen to his distinctive voice
set to the music of a collection of
musicians known as "Friends and
Neighbors." This pretty scene
may be less remote than it might
first appear. It seems that each
grade has chipped in to bring
Taylor onto the lawn in back of
the Campus Center for free no
less.

I know very little of Taylor's
music, outside of what may be
heard on his one album “Friends
and Neighbors," Suffice it to say
that I'm a little sorry that Tom
Paxton, the man originally sche-
duled,could not make it. Weather
permitting, however, good things
are bound to happen Thursday
evening, April 22.

People who read this section of
the neWspaper with a certain eo—
gree of regularity may recall an
article some issues back that
talked about this crazy guy with
long white hair who played some
fantastic blues to go with his rock
and roll repertoire, But then,
Johnny Winter is no stranger to
those of you who saw him last
spring or elsewhere. In any case,
with psychic aplomb,l told about
“seeing Goldilocks while you
can." Well, you can. “Jolimly
Winter And" is making it into our
gym with a new repertoire of
some good old music.

Playing on the same hill is
'I‘yrannisaurus Rex, a group that‘s
making it to a certain extent after
kicking around for a few years.
They can sound good, also. In
general, fine things can happen at
this kind of show, just don't come
expecting to enjoy a concert by
sitting on your ass and waiting for
it to end. To mediocre audiences,
Johnny is good; to living audi-
cnccs, Johnny Winter is Johnny
Winter.

Still, the baddest sounds may be

heard from Saturday night's per-
formance at gym. The beautiful
little Sax player in the dashiki will
high-light Black Weekend's gift to
the campus music scene.

In you can grasp what it means
to be praying to God while you
play music, then you can begin to
dig up what is so captivating
about Pharoah Saunders. He can
take his sounds to the limit of
experience, where he can use his
instrument as an extension of
himself with which he can relate
his being to the world.

I’m listening to this early album
by Pharoah on the now defunct
“ESP—Disk” label, You see, it
wasn't. “coo " in those (lays to be
into Jazz, and brilliant young
musicians would scrounge to find
bits in small clubs, in beat-up
dance halls, in bars anywhere, just

off and have some people listen»

haVe record companies want to
cut your stuff for public con-
sumption. I’haroah was good, and

So the man joins up with the
Coltrane family, and begins
making his presence felt on the
contemporary jazz scene. Now
he's working with the fincst,John
and Alice on horn and piano
respectively, McCoy 'I‘yncr
making sure those keyboards

ing things up with a fine job on

things out with his masterful and
steady percussion work.

moments later, l’haroah emerges
as a true virtuoso at. Sax. He has
his own band to do it with how

But bear in mind that I’haroab has

prepared to enjoy, though, and
Pharoah won’t let you go. So
maybe I'll catch you at the big
Pharoah blast on Saturday night,
just like the Taylor and Winter
shows on the nights before. It
looks like these two new entities
as such Spring and Black Weekend
could provide some of the really
tight musical moments of the
school year, without running your
pockets into the ground.

Gordon Lightioot
Performs at RIPE

Gordon Lightfoot will appear in
concert at the R,P.l. Field House
on Saturday May 1 at 8:00 pm,
as part of the Interfraternity
Council Weekend on the R.P,l.
campus.

Those people fortunate enough
to secure tickets for this perform-
ance will have a real treat in store
as Gordon Lightfoot, alternating
between the full, silvery sound of
his 12 string guitar and that of his
six string, will present a succession
of delights during the two hour
concert. Lightfoot will be accom-
panied by the stimulating guitar

Ear

by Arlene Scheurer

Shiloh (Amos AAS 7015) is the
name of a very efficient rock
group and the name of their re-
cord. The recording is good and
the group sountk together enough.
The lead guitarist is pretty energe—
tic. There is not, however, a great
deal of originality or group sound.
I wouldn't waste my money on it.

The 5th Dimension's album
Law's Lilies, Angles and Rhymes
(Bell 6060) is exceptionally good.

Well, commercial H is. bu"
superior commercial music at
least. There are few groups of any
kind that can play with the consis-
tency of the 5th Dimension at
such an entertaining level. There is
a good deal of variety, and liveli-
ness and thier fans will love it,
The queer cover will get you too.

John Mayall‘s new double album
Back to (he Roots (Folydor
25-3002) is the best rock album
I've heard this year. Mayall is a
superior talent both at the key-
board and on the harmonica. lit!
also has an affinity for light blues
singing. The most interesting thing
about this ablum is the reunion
idea. He has a lot of his old
cohorts brick again. So Eric Clapv
ton returns to play some beautiful
guitar solos on “Force of Nature"
and “Goodbye December." So
Johnny Almond plays some
haurty tenor and full throated
flute. So Sugar Cane Harris plays
some violin with such fire that
Smokey The Bear would run for
his life. A rock record collection
without this album would be like
leerace missing his two front
teeth.

     
 
    

      
      
  
     
   
    
    
    
   
   
    
     
     
   
   
 
    
   
   
   
   

of Red Shea, and the workman-
like bass of Rick Haynes,

Lightfoot's voice is one of those
uniqucvoiccs that defy mimicry.
This is partly because his voice
and his material are expressivcly
inextricable, in the fine way that
you expect a lead singer to inter-
pret an art song.

Saturday, May 1 will be theI
highlight of area entertainment
with the sumptuous blend of
three guitars and Lightfoot‘s fer-
vid, muscular voice almost color
ing the air various shades of blue.

Ryan’s Daughter

The New Lean/Bolt Failure

'by Tom Quigley

It is beyond comprehension as
to the real reason that Director
David Lean and scenarist Robert
Bolt continue to attract large
adoring droves of moviegoers to
their films. Their reputation for
producing “clean” epics became
secure with the great financial
successes of LAWRENCE OF
ARABIA and DR. ZHIVAGO.
Unfortunately the Lean-Bolt com-
bination may only stand for in—
stant money for they have yet to
prove that they can make a movie
worth sitting through.

Their latest and most inept col-
laboration of literary pretentions
and phallic symbolism is entitled
RYAN'S DAUGHTER a movie
that, frame for frame, is most
notable for its overproduced,
widescrcen, panoramic emptiness.
It also confirms the tragic sus-
picion that David Lean‘s once
dominant force as a major film
director has all but dwindled to
the adjustment of F-stops on
those huge Mitchell Cameras.

Leon's eye for detail does man-
age to bring back and clement
sorely lacking from today's films:
visual beauty, In their past efforts
Lean and Bolt have relied upon
the genius of Frederick A. Young
B.S.C., one of Britain's most ac-
complished cinematographers, and
the formidable musical talents of
composer Maurice Jarre to gloss
over the gaps in their pithy plots
Young comes through once again
and it would take a purblind idiot
to call down critical wrath upon
those images of majestic, cloud
swept mountains and the white,
western Ireland beaches contras-
ted with thc blue-green ocean
breakers. Maurice Jarre, however,
has written an overblown score
that consists of one theme re-
peated over and over in numerous,
thinly disguised variations.

Bolt is one of the most pompous,
over-theatrical bom who has ever
tried to fatal. I pretentious, litur-
ary script on an unsuspecting
audience. He seems to have no
concept of pacing or movement
within a plot because his dull little
forty-five minute story unraels at
a rate of speed calculated to lull
any victim of chronic insomnia to
sleep.

Rosy Ryan, daughter of an
I.R.A. pubowner in Northern Ire-
land, falls in love and marries
Shaughnessy the town school-
teacher. Shaughnessy's age pre-
vents him from cutting the erotic
mustard and Rosy pines away for
some phallic action. Along comes
a young, much decorated British
war hero and to cveryone's sur-
prise he and Rosy commit some
splendid adultry. Flesh out what
little you have with a gruff old
priest, a grotesque town cretin,
some energetic villagers and a
wretchedly developed subplot in-
volving an incredibly bumbling
group of I.R.A. revolutionaries,
and you have the soap opera
behind RYAN'S DAUGHTER.

Sarah Miles is charming in the
Very substantial and well acted
role of Rosy. Robert Mitchum is
awkwardly miscust but does his

but u the gentle schoolteacher.
(nu-Mopth Jones betrays the fact
that he isn't British by hardly
speaking. When he does though he
is surprisineg good u the stiff
British ofﬁcer. John Milla' perfor-
mance as Michael, the town idiot,
has been gathering unnecessary
overpraise from other critics and,
indeed, won him an Academy
Award ovar the much better per-
formances by Chief Dan George
and Gene Hackman. Mills is a
great actor but the role seems to
cruelly exploit the handicapped
for entertainment values which is
deplorable. It is Trevor Howard as
the gruff old alcohol prone priest
who steals top honors in the
supporting roles.

Lean and Bolt can no longer
fool moviegoers with the fantasy
that they are "important" film
makers. Financially ailing M.G.M.
teamed-up these two men to cash
in on their commercial appeal. If
by chance they produced any-
thing worthwhile along thy way it
was incidental just so long as that
greedy lion could gobble up the
profits. What the lion has swal-
lowed whole is David Lean’s inte-
grity and proven that three hours
of any oversimplified nothing like
RYAN'S DAUGHTER is deadly.
