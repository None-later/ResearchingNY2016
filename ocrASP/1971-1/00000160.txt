William B. Haessig a member of the three-man committee
appointed by Mayor Coming of Albany. to study the problems of the
new high school for the city, said on Thursday that the parties
involved in the project— the school board, the architects and the
mayor ought to share equally in the blame for the five-year delay for
the new school.

Haessig blamed poor communications between the different
parties involved and cost estimate errors on the part of the architects
for much of the trouble.

Albany high school utilizing pil~
ings already set in the ground
from a previous design. Actually
the pilings are there from the
original plan two designs ago, not
the latest design.

This situation exists because
the second “revised” plan for the
new Albany High has been aban-
doned. Mayor Corning made the
announcement last week in keep-
ing with the recommendations of
an, appointed three«man commit-
tee which had made a study of the
problem-plagued new high school
venture.

Between $3.2 and $3.7 mil-
lion has already been spent on the
high school: $1.8 million on pil-
ings. $140,000 on excavation and
from $1 million to $1.5 million to

the mayor on February it) found
the architects had made mistakes
in making the original estimates of
“several million dollars".

The original plans were can-
celled in May, I970, after the
construction bids came in at $36
million and upwards. 240% ovur
the architects‘ estimates of $15
million.

Because of the excessively
high cost, the plans were revised
last year and a smaller, less costly
design was iirriVed at. On Jan. 2 of
this year, construction bids came
in for one section of the school at
$20.5 million and up, 50% over
the revised plans' estimated cost.

This revised plan was going
to utilize much of the original

The plans for the new school
began in |965 when the site ofSt.
Mary's Park on Washington Ave-
nue. was acquired. In March, 1966,
the Board of Education issued ti
policy statement that the school
Would be ready in 1069, and this
was updated to the fall of ‘68. By
the spring of 1967. the date was
again pushed back to the original
fall of '69 opening. in the fall of
'68 the architects announced.
Novomber ‘71 was the target date.

During 1960 groundbreaking
and the driving of the pilings
occurred. Mayor Corning, during
his seventh re-election campaign.
that year. had this to say about
the new high school: “it is be-
cause of planning such as this. and

Sieve Shaw also felt that the university's professed liberalism was
slii-cr hypor " I. “Once again student apathy has shown itself. Albany
State, the so-called liberal-oriented iinchrsity, is cxtreiiicly hypocrit-
ical for its lack of sympathy with humanity." in- said.

But the spirit. of those who did stay at the Capitol steps for the
Zilliilll‘ vigil was superb. As Barry Silver-berg said: “ Those of us who
coordinated the march and vigil and those who came along with us
compensated forth disappointment of the turnout."

So these students and members of Albany’s Jewish community
danced, sang, and rapped through the night. A few Assemblymen and
Senators came out and spoke, either formally or informally. Senator
Marclii (Republican, Staten island) delivered a brief address. while
Assemblyman Seymour Posner (Democrat. Bronx) rapped with a few
studean well into l.lll‘ night. Even Mayor Corning showed up to say a
few words.

Part of the activities beside those mentioned included a playlet on
the Holocaust, Dennis Pragcr, reading names of the victims of Nazi
genocide, and services. At. the vigil‘s peak, 3500 people, mostly from
the community, came to participate.

Yesterday afternoon while the vigil continued from the night before.
the State Legislature passed a resolution “congralulatiiig the goVern-
ment and the people of the State of lsracl upon the tweiily~lhird
