' War Veterans Rally:
Police Clgear Area

by om PPY
Associated Press Writer

District of Columbia police broke up a demon-
stration by Vietnam veterans on the steps of the
Supreme Court today. arresting 110 of the antiwar
activists. The 110, two of whom were women were
taken to two police stations, where individual bonds
of $10 were set. They were charged with disorderly
conduct, rather than the more serious imped-
ing-of—justice charge which was cited to them when
they were arrested.

When word of the arrests was announced at the
veterans' camp on the Capital Mall, requests were
made for donations to pay bail or fines. Many of the
veterans were given canisters and sent to various
parts of Washington to solicit money.

Arrangements also were made for the veterans to
sell their blood at $25 per pint.

The veterans, in town this week for a series of‘
activities aimed at speeding an and to the Vietnam
war, offered generally no resistance as police escor-
ted them fro'm the steps under the huge pillars of
the court to a police bus.

Some of the veterans told newsmen they were
protesting speciﬁcally in opposition to Wednesday's
Supreme Court decision upholding a US. District
Court ruling forbidding the veterans to sleep, build
fires or pitch tents on the Capital Mall where they
have been staying all week.

Many of the veterans at the court clasped their
hands on top of their heads and marched olf with
the police in what they called “prisoner of war

Two Students. Arrested

On Drug Sale Charge

by Steve Salant

rl‘wo students. State Quad residents were arrested
by State Police on drug sale charges on Wednesday
morning. They were taken to Albany County Jail.

At approximately 8:20 am. on Wednesday, plai-
nclothes state policemen arrived at State Quad with
warrants for the arrest of one male student in
Anthony Hall and one female student in Cooper
Hall. Both were charged with a Class C felony which
is “the sale of dangerous drugs." This charge covers
the sale of marijuana and heroin and carries a
maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.

In conjunction with the two arrests on campus.
Siena College had three arrests and off-campus
homes were hit as well. Security sources said that
most of the arrests were due to information received
in off-campus investigations and arrests. It may also
be speculated that since the police didn’t use search
warrants but had warrants with the student‘s name
and the charge, that the police may have gotten
information necessary for the warrant from a
narcotics officer involved in dealings with the
students.

in yesterday's arraignment, the two SUNY stu-
dcnls wcrc rclcascd on probation.

Brydges Submits Tuition Bill

Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydgcs announced that he is
submitting legislation to enable cvcry cum-gt; Student in the state to
borrow enough money to finance his higher education. The measure
Would combine elements of the “deferred tuition" system and the
present state student-loan program. Students could borrow up to
$15,000 chr-all and spread repayments ovar up to ‘20 years.
