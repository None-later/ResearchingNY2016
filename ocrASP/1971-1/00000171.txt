Stickmen Run League Slate to 4-0

by Dave Fink

The Varsity LaCrosse team
took to the road this week but
they didn't leave any of their
scoring pttncit back in Albany.
The Danes turned back a tough
Rl'T team Wednesday ttnd Clob-
bored Hartwick Saturday by
14—11 and 14-5 scores, respec-
tively, to run their division record
104-0.

After playing two games in rela-

Couch Robert Ford‘s squad ran up
against. cold condition, rain and
snow. This didn't make much
difference, though, as nine differ

The Hartwick game was the

Seven men found the range and
goaltender Tom Heislur probably
played his most impressive game,
thus far, despite rain, snow and
generally awful conditions Gar-

as Smith added three more. Sud-
