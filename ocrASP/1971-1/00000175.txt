“Dean” Means N ever H wing to Say You’re Sorry

Today let us pay tribute to the most overworked and under-
appreciated ﬁgure on campus. I refer of course to the Dean.

The Dean (from the Latin dcancrc—to disembowel) is not, as
most of you seem to think, a kind of academic policeman. True,
he does administer discipline sometimes, but more often he admin-
isters kindness, understanding and simple human goodness. The
Dean (from the Greek deanos—to rend) is much more than a rule
enforcer; he is also guide and oracle, shepherd and seer, pro-
consul and pal. The Dean (from the German dcungcmachf—to poop
a party) is available day and night to students with problems. His
hours are long, his free time practically nonexistent. Therefore,
on those rare occasions when he does manage to get a few minutes
to relax, he does it in the best possible way, which means of course
he sits down and stretches his legs and pours himself a glass of
Miller High Life Beer.

Why Miller High Life? Because Miller High Life, as every
thinking American knows, is the perfect beer to refresh and
restore. It is a haven to the harried, a shelter to the spent, a huoy
to the beat, a boon to the hunt, a holster to the licdi'aggled. a pillow
to the pooped. Try it yourself the next time you get weary and sick
of trying and tired of living and scared of dying. You'll ﬁnd it
gratifyingly true what the kindly, decent folks who make Miller
Beer keep telling us:"I/' Uflll'l'l' ya! llic filllf', inc'vc go! the boar.”

But I digress. We were paying tribute to that selﬂess, shining
personage. the Dean. We do not begin to appreciate how hard he
works. how hideously complex the problems he solves each day.
Take, for example, these typical cases from the ﬁles of Dean

at the University of Y__. (If you promise not to
tell, 1'“ give you the real names. The Dean is called Sigafoos and
the University is Yutah.)

Recently, the Dean was visited by a freshman named Walter
Acupuncture who came to ask permission to marry one Emma
Blenheim. his dormitory laundress. To the Dean the marriage
seemed ill-advised, for Walter was 18 years of age and Emma was
94, and rarely do these May-September romances work nut.

After a frank. man-to-mon talk, the Dean persuaded Waiter
of the folly of his course. Still, Walter felt guilty about jilting
Emma who had had her garnets polished and bought three new suits
of underwear in anticipation of the honeymoon. The Dean sug-
gested that Waiter send her a handsome gift to soothe her feel-
ings, and Walter did. He scat Emma a nice kidney machine, and
they are good friends to this day.

Freed from his misalliancc with Emma, Walter soon found
a girl much nearer his own age—Agnes Yucca, 74. Today they are
happily married and Walter is the proud filLllcr—le'p-flllhcr,
actually—of three ﬁne bouncing boys from Agnes's first marriage-—
Everett, 38; Willem, 43; and Rex, 55. Belicvc mo, when Walter
puts the boys in their little velvet suits and takes them out in the
perambulator on Sunday afternoons. there is not a dry eye in
all Yutah.

But kindness and understanding don't always work. Some-
times the Dean has no choice but to be Iirm. Take, for instance,
the case of Baxter Mackadangdang.

Baxter, an exchange student from Polynesia, grew up In the
idyllic South Sea Isle of Goonu-Goonu where the leading social
event of the year was the feast of Max. the Sun God. A quaint
all-day ceremony was held. with tribal dancing, war chants. fat
lady races, pie-eating contests, and, for the grand finale, the
sacriﬁce of eleven dozen virgins.

Thus. according to Baxter’s folkways, sacriﬁcing virgins was
perfectly acceptable, but when he became an exchange student he
soon learned that Americans take a dim view of this custom. in
Yutah, at any rate. The first twelve or thirteen times Baxter
sacrificed a Virgin. the Dean let him of! with a warning. When,
however, Baxter persisted. the Dean was forced to impose a heavy
penalty: he cancelled Baxter's parking permit.

A broken man, Baxter quit school and returned to Ocean-
Goona where today he scratches out a meager living selling forged
autographs of Joseph Conrad.
