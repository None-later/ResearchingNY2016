With gross returns ifrom the
Indochina traffic runniii’gz' ‘any-
where from $250 to $500 million
per year, opium is one of the
kingpins of Southeast Asian
commerce. Indochina has not al-
ways had such an enviable posi-
tion. Historically most of the
world‘s supply of opium and
heroin came through well-estab-
lished routes from Turkey, Iran
and China. Then it was refined in
chemical kitchens and warehouse
factories in Marseille. The Medi-

inthenarcoh’cscor'tt‘ divisionof the
Canadian government, and in
Interpol, the International Police
Agency, confirm that since World
War II—and paralleling U.S. ex-
pansion in the Pacific-there has
been a major redirection in the
sources and routing of the world-
wide opium trade.

According to the United Nations
Commission on Drugs and Nor.
cotics, since at least 1966, 80% of
the world’s I200 tons of illicit
opium has come from Southeast
Asia—directly contradicting most
official U.S. claims that the pri-
mary sources are Middle Eastern.
In 1966, lnterpol's former Secre-
tary General Jean Ncpote told
investigators 'from Arthur D.
Little Research Institute that the
Fertile Triangle was a principal
production center of opium. And
last year an Iranian government
official told a United Nations sem-
inar on narcotics control that 83
percent of the world’s illegal sup-
ply originated in the Fertile Tri-
angle—the area where opium is
controlled by the U.S.—supplied
troops of Laos and Nationalist
China.

It is no accident that Nixon has
ignored the real sources of her-
cotics trade abroad and by so
doing has effectively precluded
any possibility of being able to
deal with heroin at home. It is he
more than anyone else who has
underwritten that trade Ahrough
the policies he has formulated, the
alliances he has forged, and most
recently the political appoint-
ments he has made. For Richard
Nixon's rise to power has been

aggressive strategy in Asia, a group
of people loosely called the
“China Lobby" who have been in
or near political power off and on
since 1950.

Among the most notable mem-
bers of the “China Lobby” are
Madame Anna Chennault, whose
husband, General Claire Chen-
nault, founded Air America;
columnist Joe Alsop; FBI director
J.Edgar Hoover; former California
Senator William Knowland; and
Ray Cline, currently Chief of In-
telligence for the State Depart-
ment. They and such compatriots
as the late Time magazine pub-
lisher Henry Luce and his widow,
Congresswoman Claire Booth
Luce, have been some of the
country's strongest proponents of
the Nationalist Chinese cause.

In 1954, Chiang Kai-shek
formed the Asian People’s Anti-
Communist League (APACL),
which was to become one of the

vital links between the China
Lobby and the Taiwan govern-
ment. As soon as the

APACL was formed, Chiang an-
nounced that it had established
“close contact" with three Amer-
ican politicians— the most impor-
tant of whom was Vice President
Richard Nixon.

The entire cast of the China
Lobby has relied on one magic
corporation, the some corporation
established just after World War II
by General Claire Chennault as
Civil Air Transport and renamed
in the 1950's Air America. Carrier
of not only men and personnel for
all of Southeast Asia, but also of
the policies that have turned Indo-
china into the third bloodiest bat-
tlefield in American history, Air
America's chief contract is with

Agency. Air America flies
through all of the Laotian and
Vietnamese opium pick-up points,
for aside from the private "butter-
fly fleet" and various military
transports, Air America is the
“official” airline.

A 25-year-old black man re-
cently returned from Indochina
told RAMPARTS of going to
Vietnam in 1968 as an adventurer,
hoping to get in on the dope
business. But he found that the
business was all controlled by a
"group like the Mafia. It was tight
and there wasn't any room for
me.“ The only way he could make
it in the dope trade, he says, was
to go to work for Air America as a
mechanic.

The shift in the international
opium traffic is also a metaphor
for what has happened in South-
east Asia itself. As the U.S. has

flecting the U.S. desires have been
established, along with houses of

in the American image. One of the
upshots has been that the opium
trade has been systematized, given
U. S. technological expertise and a
shipping and transportation net-
work as pervasive as the U.S.
presence itself. The piratical Cor-
sican transporters have been re-
placed by pragmatic technocrats

ly accuracy, unimpeded by boun—

flow of military personnel
through the capitols of the Orient,

of its warfare in Indochina—built
up a support system for the trade
in narcotics that is unparallelled in
modern history.

SUNY Institute Aids Elderly

by Debbie Natansohn

Did you ever ask your grand-
father what happened when he
marched on Washington? Or what
part he played in the Russian
Revolution?

Society and this Univorsity are
ignoring one great source of
knowledge— our Senior Citizens,
the ones who have lived through
so many of the experiences that
we study about in the classroom.
Instead of recognizing the value
and wisdom of the elderly, we
ignore them, put them in homes,
and try to forget that they are
around.

“The elderly are the most op-
pressed minority in our society,"
says Father Anthony Rocha, a
Roman Catholic Priest, graduate
of Harvard's School of Public
Health, and full professor here at
Albany. “The aging process is the
most certain thing in life, but
most citizens have psychological
hangups about aging, illness, and
dying. These hangups, whether on
the conscious or subconscious
level, cause most people to ignore
and oppress the aged. This is a
youth-oriented nation.”

The problems of the elderly will
be one of the major focuses of the

from Indian (luad
Central Council

 

 

Institute of Gerontology which
Dr. Rocha is presently establishing
on the SUNYA campus. Geron-
tology is the study of the aging
process, or, as Father Rocha likes
to call it,“the study of men from
the womb to the tomb." There
will be four general areas of
study: biological, clinical, psycho-
logical, and social. Five degree
programs will include two in the
undergraduate and three on the
graduate levels. The institute,
which plans to open in the fall of
1972, will be serving not only the
Albany campus but the entire
SUNY system.

Although gerontology studies
people in all age groups, emphasis
will be made on Llli‘ study of the
elderly because they are in a crisis
situation. A recently published
national report states that the
elderly remain the most disadvan-
taged of all minority groups in our
society. Yet they are one of the
few who have no lobbies working
forthem in Congress, and they got
minimal support in the national

press.
Few pcoplt' realize how poor the
' economic condition of the major-
ity of this nation's elderly is. Only
the privileged few are in nursing
homes, which at least supply food
and health care. Others, who are

less fortunate, live alone in the
slums of the cities, with minimal
Social Security incomes. Prices in
local stores are ikely to rise on the
day the Social Security check
arrives— eggs, for instance, go
from 49 to 79 cents a dozen.
Many elderly persons are forced
to live on less than $1000 a year.

But economics is not the only
problem. There is a lack of health
care, educational facilities, trans-
portation, and compassion.
“Health care should be a right,
not a privilege," claims Father
Rocha. He also urges that the
University set up tuition-free
courses for those over 65 years of
age. “Although an older person‘s
senses weaken with ago, his intcl-
lectual capacities do not. An older
man might take longer to reason
out a question, but this is because
l‘lt' has many more life experiences
to consider before answering."
Both the College of Saint Rose
and Union College have set up
courses for senior citizens in this
area.

Perhaps the most oppressive
thing that the elderly have to bear
is the psychological violence
reaped upon them by society.
Much the same as Blacks used to
feel they were inferior, the aged
are beginning to feel that they
belong on a shelf, away from
society's youth-oriented culture.
"If an old lady gets mugged, it
makes news; but when she is
rejected by the people around her,
it hurts her more."

Father Rocha feels that the
elderly and the young can learn
from each other, and blames his
generation for keeping the two
apart. “My generation is “)0
‘heavy' in this drama. They're the
ones who are telling you to re-
spect IlIl' past and yet, look at
how they are treating l.ht' elder-
ly." llc attacks lcgislatttrs, the
Church, and the Univcrsily for
remaining apathetic.

“How can a legislator claim '10 is
a sincr-rc cliurchgot-r while Iii"
priving the elderly of “IO llt‘t‘t's‘r
sitics of life?"

Through his institute on cam-
pus, l)r. Rocha httpt‘s to begin
alleviating the problems of the
aged by raising public conscious-
ncss. Ilc sucks the aid of the
university community to do so.
But so far, he has met with littlc
encouragement: no staff, little
space, and little money.

“The SUNY system knew my
potential when they asked my to
come here. I should hope that the
present situation improves; if not,
then the administration will be

guilty of tokenism."

currently in the State legislature
which would place the Institute’s
funding directly under the aus-
pices fo the legislature. This
would hopefully give the Institute
more funds than they are getting

with current cuts in the state
budget, nothing is certain—ex-

in this wealthy nation are suf-
fering, and that somebody better
