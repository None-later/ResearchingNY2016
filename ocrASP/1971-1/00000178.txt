The ASP Sports bids farewell in

tionally well.

Baseball: 6-1-1

This Week? Tuesday at Union;

The Great Danes are off to
their finest start in recent base-
ball history . and have a
good shot at the school record of

11 victories. The pitching has
been superb, with the entire staff
permittingjust 1.36 earned runs a
game. Freshman Kevin Quinn
(Westbury) has yet to permit an
earned; run in two complete game
victories. Senior Hi Doolittle (Al-
bany) is unbeaten in three deci-
sions. Second busemnn Rod

sive improvement over Inst year's

Zeke Speaks

by Robert Zaremba

 

 

The question of the athletic tax vote is one which has drawn much print
already, but deserves still more. The athletic program of a University is such an

extremely

vital, integral part on any collegiate institution, and it must be seen

as such. For some reason, student and faculty government at this school has
consistently shown their disagreement with this. The move to actually separate
atheltics from other student activities, is their most recent expression of this
and their most recent demonstration of their feelings that if things are tight, the
most dispensable item on their list is the athletics program.

Take out your most recent Torch yearbook, and look through some of the
organizations funded by student monies. See if you can't find some obscure
organizations that you would think could stand to stiffer some stiller cutbacks
than those that would befall the sports program if the mandatory assessment

isn’t passed.
It's not only the 595 actual

participants. “'5 not only the 66,000

approximate spectators (students, faculty, alumni. and community). A team in
any sport is the closest thing to a true "ambassador" that a school could have.
It carries the name of the Univarsity in total, and in a very strong sense

represents each and every one of us. It

carries our name through the medium of

the sports world, and one only has to pick up a newspaper or turn on the
T.V.over any weekend, to see iust how popular a medium this is.

In addition, the "sports world" of Albany State happens to be a particularly
remarkable one. In defiance of all odds, it is amalingly successful. Varsity teams
Mich as Basketball and Cross Country have long established winning traditions.
Team: which have just recently emerged from club status (Track, LaCrossel

have Instantly become winners.

The student body of Albany State has often been accused of apathy and
inaction. In the area of sports, however, there is a staggering amount a
enthusiasm and dedication from the coaching staff and the participating

students -

if there is any spirit to be found in this school, it can be found In the Physical

Education Department. Believe it.

Believe it and do something about preserving it. Vote mandatory athletic tax.

Fishman Undefeated

by Dick Sexton

The Albany State Great Danes
Varsity Tennis Team recently con-
tinued their winning ways with
two more victories and, in doing
so, extended their won-loss record
to 5-1.

In the past week. the Danes
faced squads from Plattsburgh and
New Pultz and fared very well
against both. Against the former,
the SUNYA team was victorious
in all of the nine matches. Their
opponents managed to win only
13 games in the nine matches.
phenomenal figure. Later in the
week, Albany played New Pnltz in
a home match, with the Danes
winning eight of nine contests, the
only loss coming on it closely
contested 6-4, 8-6 match.

Couch Merlin Hathaway has
been very satisﬁed with the per-
formance of his not men. Indivi-

lduully. they have progressed much

further than expected, and the
team development has reached an

excellent level. According to
Hathaway, all members are gain-
ing and playing with much more
poise now than at the beginning
of the season.

At the present time. individual
statistics indicate exactly how
dominating the team has been
over its opponents. The top-
ranked player on the team, senior
Ken Fishman, has remained unde-
feated through six matches. Ted
Rosenberg has won his last two
matches and is 4-2 at this point.
Eric Carlson and Chris Burke are
both 5-1. Harold Forrest and John
Buffone, at. present at 4-2.

If such a performance continues,
the chance of receiving a post--
season bid to the NCAA tourna-
mcnt will be greatly improved.
However, the team will probably
have its toughest matches of the
season coming up this week a-
gainst Hartwick today in an away
match and at home Friday against
Oneonta at 3:30 p.ni.
