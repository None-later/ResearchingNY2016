Counseling Center Gives
Professional Guidance

by Claudia McDonnell
An ASP Feature

A University, by definition, is
dedicated to the realization and
development of the individual to
the full extent of his potential. It
provides the means to this end in
many forms, both academic and
extracurricular. Unfortunately,
however, many students are either
unaware of the educational oppor-
tunities offered to them outside
the classroom, or misinformed
about them. Such is sometimes
the case with the learning experi-
ence known as Counseling Center.

A prevalent misconception
states that people who seek coun-
seling are sick. Actually, the oppo-
site is true. As one counselor put
it, the Center does not "treat"
people. To have problemeis' nor-
mal. Tc want to deal with them is
healthy. People who are intellect-
ually alive naturally question cer’
tain conditions and relationships
in their lives. Counseling helps
them to identify the area of con-
cern and work out a reasonable
solution. Most importantly, it
does not hand out answers; it
stresses the fact that the solution
to any problem lies within the

if the rain plan ls Implemented, graduates will report to the Gym at l PM
and don academic regalia in the men’s locker room. They will proceed

party will participate in the academic procession it the ceremony is held

Each graduate and degree candidate will receive two guest tickets for the
Indoor ceremony. Because seating in the Gym is limited, tickets admitting
guests to that area will be distributed on a ilrst-come-iirst-serve basis. After
the Gym tickets are depleted. guest tickets for closed circuit TV coverage on
the Academic Podium will be issued. These tickets will indicate the precise
viewing arms and ushers will be on hand to assist guests In these locations.
Shuttle buses will be available to transport graduates and guests from the

The Commencement Committee and the President regret that there is no
sheltered space available at the University which will seat all the parents of
all graduates. We mi? your cooperation as we strive to provide adequate
facilities for all to view the ceremony.

On Commencement Day, the CC Information Desk, the University Switch-
board. and Commencement usher will bepreparad to answer questions about

individual himself. Every person
who comes in for counseling is
competent and capable of deter-
mining an effective course of
action. The Center does not think
for anyone; it guides and advises.
In short, counseling. is a shared
experience in which counselor and
client cooperate to understand a
situation.

Who comes to the Center, and
why? The Counseling Center at
SUNYA deals only with Univer-
sity students: their concerns are
generally of a personal, vocatiom
al, or career-related nature, Most
people come because they hairc
heard about the Center though
their friends, but a small percent-
age is referred by faculty, medical
service, or dorm directors. Coun-
selors’ reports concerning the stu-
dents they work with are most
enthusiastic: all of them, say the
counselors, are open, honest, high~
ly motivated and eager to work.

The Center itself has’a staff of
fourteen counselors. Dr. John E.
Tucker, the director, has the
l’h.D. degree in clinich psycho-
logy. Two other members, Drs.
Reed and Cook,-h,nld the doctor-
ate degree, and seven more are

presently working toward it. The
rest are earning their masters de-
grees. The Center requires all its
counselors to have a heavy prepar-
ation in psychology, and previous
counseling experience before em-
ployment at SUNYA. In addition,
the Center supervises the training
of new members and pro-profes-
sional students. The highest stan-
durds are maintained at all times
for all staff members, in the inter-
est of providing the clients with
the best kind of service. As Dr.
Tucker says, the Center is very
committed to doing the best job it
can, and has made a concerted
effort toward that. goal. Students
can feel confident when dealing
with the Center: it has met the
stringent requirements of the
American Board of Counseling
Services, and is listed in their
directory of Approved Counseling
Agencies.

The University provides the
funds for the operation of the
Counseling Center, and has en-
sured the advantages of superior
equipment and a pleasant environ-
ment. Dr. Tucker points’out that
the uttitudc of the University
toward the Center has been con-
sistently positive and encouraging.

The young adult who is inter-
cstcd in meeting with a counselor
may wonder about the procedure
of the sessions. Actually, there are
no formal rules: everything is left
to the discretion of the counselor
ttnd the student. Sometimes they
work alone; occasionally, outside
help may be ncccssury and the
counselor advises accordingly, ro-
fcrring the person to an agency or
hospital outside the University.
This is, of course, done with the
cooperation and authorization of
llto person involved. All inter-
action between counselor and
client is held in the strictest con»
fidcncc.

The group method ofcounscling
is usod when the counselor fouls it

one, and a variety of opinions and
su’ggestions can be raised. Third, it
is a very positive gesture in terms
of sharing. The students can take
on the role of counselor them-
selves, with the official counselor
as a model, and help each other
directly. In this way individual
skills are brought to the surface,
and people are given the chance to
see problems in a different per-
spective. From every aspect,
group counseling can be a most
rewarding and reinforcing experi-
ence.

Thus far, the reports of both
students and counselors regarding
theCenter's successhave dc finitely
been positive. Though it is not
easy to arrive at a quantitative
evaluation of effectiveness, the
Center seems to have established
a firm reputation among students
for skill and relevance. It seems to
provide an essential dimension
that is sometimes lacking in Uni-
vcrsily lifo: sharing. Most stutlt‘nls
and faculty will attest to u ccrtuin
incvitnblo amount of dcpcrsonul-
irtttion within tho University
framework. Even a factor like the
architecture of the campus can
hch an effect on the interaction
of the school community: minty a
studan cunnot name all the
pooplo in his hull, due to the fact
that the arrangement of suites and
rooms can keep people from
nit-cling ouclt other. Counsoling
can romody this breakdown in
communication, whcthcr it uids
ono sludonl individually or M
group in a session togothcr. As Dr.
'l'uckcr slrossos,“Ench student is u
polontinl resource for ull tho other
students on campus. MnybtI t-uch
student doesn't rcnlizo how much
ho cun hclp." One or two pooplo
who Cltn hatch and contmiiniculc
can have it positive impact on u

 

maluerwn
sizable number of people.

What about plans for the future?
There is no doubt that the aspect
and direction of counseling are
expanding to meet. many different
demands. “Outreach activities"
are playing a more significant role
in the Center‘s functions. These
involve speaking to groups on
invitation, getting involved with
communications skills, and some
times having counselor offices in
student dormitories to help young
adults adjust to college living. In
other words, counseling is begin-
ning to operate on a broader levol
than before in order to incrcusc
opportunities for self-knowledge
and personal development in all
areas of campus life. This type of
work is not opposed to individual
counseling, nor does it ncccssilutc
u choice between them. Rather, it
is another side of the Center's
commitment to human growlh,
and is hopefully it means of stimu-
lating u greater number of people
to it full realization of their poten-
tial in society.

Is thcrc anything the individual
student can do? By all mcuns.
“Communicution,” suys Dr.
'l‘ucltcr, “starts with listening. Siti-
donts have in them resources as
counselors and its problem
solvers." This applies to one's owtt
probloms and the problems of
others. It cannot be at sscd
strongly enough that any kind of
counsoling is in learning expori-
once. It should be shurcd by coun-
solor and student, by student and
sludcnl., and by groups working
together. it is tho moons for tho

The American Dreu

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\
‘ \\\\\

 

by Tom Quigley

On Tuesday April 20th, I
attended a press screening of the
new Lawrence Schiller-UM. Kit
Carson film The American
Dreamer that stars Dennis
Hopper. The notoriety of this film
stems from the unique distribu-
tion and exhibition procedures
instituted by Corda Productions
and EYR programs, the distribu-
tors.

The usual methods of'commer-
cial theatrical presentation will be
by-passed in favor of a nationwide
campus distribution. SUNYA, un-
der the auspices of the Tower East
Cinema, will be one of 24 cam-
puses to host a premiere perform—
ance of The American Dreamer
beginning Wednesday April 28th
and continuing through to Suture
day May list.

This brings us to the film itself
and it's affable co-produccr
L.M.Kit Carson who came to the
screening and with whom i had
the pleasure of speaking.

Carson, u native of Dallas, began
working with film as an editor for
Robert Drew Associates at
NBC-TV. In 1967 he wrote and
starred in his first feature length
i'tlm David Holzrnan's Diury, di-
rected by Jim McBride and photo
graphed by Michael Wutllcigh,
who was corproduccr and Director
of Photography for Woodstock.
Carson has also written for major
muguzincs including the Evergreen
Review which gave hint on assign»
man, in 1969, to interview
Dennis Hopper fresh from his
triumph With Easy Ifftft'l‘. This lot!
Carson to a lasting friendship with
Hopper and the reason for tho
production of The .‘IIIit‘I'I-t'tlll
Dreamer.

Carson felt that Dennis' views
and the ever-changing life style of
his Tnos, New Mexico, commune,
interested college audiences in the
directors own media: film. He
took his proposal to noted inde-
pendent photo-journalist
Lawrence Schiller, the man ro-
sponsible for the mnrvclons still
photo Sequences in Butch Cusslrly
and (he Stutdaricc Kid,who was
devoting all his time to the direct»
ing and producing of motion pic-
tures. Both men gathered a top
ﬂight independent crew and in-
vaded Hopper's Los Angeles npurl-
ment while he was taking in bath.
They subsequently followed hint
to New Mexico for in duys and
26 hours of spontuncous cinema.

Whut they recorded may not add
up to im eurth-shuttcrcing, signifi-
cant movic but the polished re
sults of this experiment spells
hope for Americn's Hugging filtn
industry. Corporution studios on
the verge of financial collapse may
hch to fucc the growing reality of
independent filmukcrs who want
nothing to do with the studio and
union red tape that is slowly
destroying the commerciul film
industry. Tho American [)rt'umor
is an experimental production
thut successfully defies classifica-

tion becuase of its incorporation
of numerous film genre into its
concept.

Director Schiller and writer
Carson have constructed a unique
blend of life-style documentary,
with photo-journalism cinema vcr-
rte, and structured film, The
American Dreamer is by no means
a thoughly incoherent, under-
ground Warhol but neither is it so
Completely structured as to be a
calculated commercial effort. One
thing however is sure: Dennis
Hopper plays himself. He may be
a confused pastiche of devil and
mythological hero but to an entire
new generation of filmakers, he is
an important paragon in the 1‘“.
lure of American Cinema.

Hopper is shown screwing a-
round (literally and figuartively)
in his nihilistic New Mexican digs
with u group of film makers and a
bizarre mob of communal,
huttgcr-onncr's. The direct
confrontations bclwcon Dennis
and the camera and the voice ovor
