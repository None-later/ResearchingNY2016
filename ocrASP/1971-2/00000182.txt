MANY
THANKS

Since many of our parents will be at SUNYA this weekend, we. their
rotten kids. have a fantastic opportunity to show how grateful we are
for the heritage passed on to us. Thank you‘s for the following are in
order.

To all the folks of male students. we would like to express our
appreciation to those with the foresight to allow a hospital nurse to
drop us shortly after birth, thus giving deformities serious enough to
get a 4-F classiﬁcation.

Thank you for allowing us to grow up in a world that has made us

strong. Had we not been allowed to live in a world where masses are.

sufficiently desperate to steal or riot. where would we have gotlch our
toughening experiences? And ifwe didn‘t have an opportunity to read
every day of police hunting down students or blacks. what could we
do to substitute for realistic domestic adventure?

A sincere thank you for instilling in us the ability to question. Had
we lived in times when presidents told the truth, how many of us
would be able to pick apart the lies and illogic of a Richard Nixon
speech as we do today'.’

And of course thanks are in order for all the wonderful cars that we
drive, even if they might be the cause of our death soon. We have a
slogan nowadays. saying. "ifwe‘rc going to have to die we may as well
do it at high speeds.jiist so we can feel at home,"

Last but not least. thanks for the security we all feel due to our
department of defense. Wiili 3.437 foreiin bases is ll no wonder that
we all feel so secure militarily? Were it not for the S‘ltt billion to be
spent on ‘dcfeiisc' this year. our brothers and sisteis lll (liltfoinia
would probably be enslichd and raped Within weeks. thank you for
their protection!

’ Let's hope that when our generation takes over the leadership of this
sbciety we do the same kind of job our parents did. If we tlo.'the

succeeding generation will make no mistakes at all.

ASP: Objective
A nalysis

To the Editors:

After reading some letters
printed in the "letters to the
editors“ section critical of the
newspaper. we decided to make
our own objective analysis of the
ASP's quality.

While the ASP has certain short~
comings it is by and large a
decent newspaper. To those who
say its slanted. Well. yes it is, But
should We call it a political rag
just because it's either it or ii!
pnch of propaganda?

'l'hc ASP also receives flying
colors in judging. its originality,
Why priicticicnlly every other word
is spelllctltl sortie way we've tichr
seen it speldedbefore.

if anyone says the only purpose
of the ASP is for reserve lavatory
paper. they are probably full of it.
Other snotty remarks have been
made about its use in place of
tissues,

1 have to give the newspaper
staff especially the editor iii-chief
much credit for their product.

To the Editors:

Having children at SUNYA l was
shocked to discover that the
moral attitudes of today's student
is as disgusting as the degenerate
school newspaper. is this what me
and my no-good husband have
been working all our lives for?

i am not the kind of mother
who isn't concerned about my
children. it hurt mt- when my son
started to shave. l was eitcn invol-
ved with my daughter's girl scout
troop. bill I hardly suspected that
the slogan “he prepared" woultl
be interpreted as it is today.

On my recent visit to campus. l
was given the impression that iii-
stead of studying to be doctors
anti lawyers most members of the
younger generation wrnit to have
wiltl sex orgies with alcohol. it's
not that l'm old-fashioned. i don‘t
mind seeing premarital kissing.

i don't wtiiit to go into other

of you i would like to say that if
anyone comes to my house with a

From the people who brought you your dinners. lunches.
breakfasts. heartburn. indigestion and near instant replay on
yesterday's leftovers...eomes the shit that hit the fan because "our
job is screwing you. "

in a memo to all Food Service employees. the logic of FU2
becomes entertainineg clear.

To wit:

"Any unauthorized issuance or taking of food from the campus
kitchen units will result in your immediate dismissal.“ We can't
feed the regular hungry masses on this campus. This is not a
welfare state. it‘s every man for himself! No ripping off our
limited food supplies! If we give grain to lndin. the Indians won't
buy grain. This upsets the whole world economy. if we give
handouts. no one will buy the meal contracts. This is detrimental
to our whole world economy. Well. it‘s in the same vein. different
proportions. Think about it.

“No eating behind the serving litres rotten on duty," We know
the delicious foods served over and over again are tempting. but it
is disgusting to see people eating while waiting on the other
patients. Besides. should you become ill, this is in poor taste and
not very good advertising; also. it is hard to find a replacement on
such short notice and all the beds in the infirmiiry are in continual
rotation after all the staggered dinner hours. Think about it.

"Please begin working before punching in. " Time is money. We
are a non-profit organization clearing nearly a quarter of a million
dollars annually and We cannot. iiffort to have the help rippitig off
t'xtra minutes changing into work clothes while on the company
clock. Remember how liberal Wt' are. Why just this year we raised
all the help‘s pay to the minimum wage. before they went on
strike! Think about. it.

“All food on lllt' sandwich board is put up lll portion control
packs. " We control only the quantity. not quality. "The extras are
as follows'

'I‘outulo (l slices of it. It)
Itrtcort $. Ill pr'r icr’

WHERE YOUR FUDE SERVICE

by PS. Flarian

l'lvt-ryoiit- has heard of “11' [faculty Student Ann-

 

“The cashiers have been (mined to know the portion control
contents of the sandwiches. Please notify them of the extras!"
Remember. their training here is like their schooling-they aren’t,
so smart; you have to tell them of the extras they're trained to see
right in front of their faces.

"Front now on. you as the sandwich maker. (sic) are
responsible for extra items that get by the cashiers unpaid for."
How the hell we're going to determine what gets by the unpaid
cashier unpaid for and fix blame on the proper worker hasn't been
worked out yet. but remember, “our job is screwing you." and
we’re working on it.

“Example: 0 BLT contains 2 slices of bacon and 3 slices of
Tomato" (lettuce. bread and mayo are optional and too petty to
trike tip time and space here). Any more on that sandwich
constitutes extra items and you. the sandwich maker, will pay the
difference if the cashier is not notified! So be prepared. If the
cashiers question the contents of a sandwich. it is the responsi-
bility of whoever (sic) prepared it to answer the question
immediately. In case of arty problems, please do tint hesitate to
confront your supervisor or (he (sir-Ir) manager.

"All pt'oplr' war/ring on the sandwich broad WILL wear Iiairnets
or caps and a white shirt (and tic) which will be furnished."
Customers will have to furnish their own bibs. “If not too soiled
al the end of your worlr period. please place where it can be
reused. The same goes for aprons." shirts and ties. and. Of course.
the hairncts. 10d on high knows enough stuff is in the food now
(mercury, detergents. etc.) for which we don't charge. Should you
notice hair in the food. please notify the cashiers so they can
charge accordingly.

“We are Irene to serve the customers and to give [be customer
increasingly better service. If properly executed. there controls
will effect that end. Not only will we have improved customer
relations. but also improved working relations with our fellow
employees. We are the workout (sic), we are also at one time or
another. the (sick) customer," Would you want extras on your
sandwich? “Think about it."
