SST: Murder?

Yesterday the House decided to kill the SST. Boeing is having the
House arrested on charges of murder. The court hearings are expected to
start sometime next year. In the meantime funeral services for the SST
are being planned by Boeing. Attendance will be by invitation only, due
to due to lack of space in the hanger. The boelng people expect to
receive at least 1,000,000 sympathy cards and approximately 40,000
bouquets of flowers.

The remaining SST, brother of the deceased, has been sold to the
Brusteam Sector XIII lnterworld Co. They are of course unaware that it
doesn’t work.

At this time Beoing had not. announced any final plans for revenge
against the House.
