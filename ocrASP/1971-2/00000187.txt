Record‘Number Apply:
Budget Effects Quota

State University of New York at Albany will close to all further
applications for the full term on May 3. The closing is necessitated by
the large numbers of applications received to date for the fall
semester.

Applications for freshman admission closed on February 1 when
SUNYA had received 9,233 applications for 1,300 available spaces.
To date, 3,341 freshmen have been accepted and a waiting list of
qualified alternates has been established pending acknowledgements
from the accepted candidates.

Applications for the Educational Opportunities Program were
closed on March 1 after the university had received more than 1,000
applications for the tentative quota of 300 students. According to
President Benezet, unless the supplemental budget. is passed, the
proposed enrollment may be curtailed.

Students desiring to transfer from other colleges and universities
were those who were affected by the most recent closeout. Last year’s
total of 3.700 applications already had been exceeded by at least 300.

The overall number of applications to date reflects an increase of
14.3% over last year, with freshman applications increasing by 11%
and applications from transfers attending other SUNY institutions
rising by 62%.

Urges May Action in D.C.

by Debbie N atansohii

.Jerry Rubin, speaking in the
Campus Center Ballroom last
Tuesday night, urged the over-
ﬂowing crowd to call a strike and
go to the May Day demonstra-
tions in Washington. Wearing ll
Viet Cong flag shirt and what he
said were his only pair of jeans,
Rubin declared, “May Din is go-
ing to be the RUVOIlIlIOll...illl(l
you'rc goingto be so pissedoff if we
have the revolution and you
weren't there."

Rubin tll‘l‘lVL‘d about forty mili-
utes later than scheduled. His zin-
nounccd speaking partner, Dave
Dcllinger, was hospitalized with
an eyc infection and was unable

to appear.  ,is, e 

But the YIPPIE leader seemed
to have no trouble in carrying the
evening by himself. He knocked
the American school system for
teaching competition (“In Ameri-
ca you get your happinms from the
unhappiness of other people"),
and declared that children‘s libera-
tion is one of the most important
movements today. Stating that he
learned everything he knows out-
side the classroom, Rubin offered
a free YIPI’IE diploma to anyone
who wanted one. He claimed that
the campuses ill'O quiet this year
because of the paranoia created
by the Kent and Jackson State
shootings. “Kent. State showed
that America is willing to shoot its
