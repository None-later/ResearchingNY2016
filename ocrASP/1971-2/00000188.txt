I would like to Inform you about some experi~

two months ago l started Working on ii vigil for
Soviet. Jewry. 1 saw a pressing need to do something

speakers; the whole bit. We had the troubles of all
beginning political groups. Not that we were politi-
cal in the iistiirl sense. As the weeks progressed l liiid
a few shocking experiences.

For the first lithe in my life anti-semitie remarks
were directed at me but that wasn't as shocking as
the identities of the people who did it. About ten
times i received stich comments iitrd rill lrtit two of
the people tltiit said it were Jews The mildest
comments came from the iron-Jew.» Then I got

the poor Jews in Russia." At the dinner lines when
we wenI asking people to sign tip for the first st)

life these past Weeks Never how I seen such denial
of identity. i think i eriir understand why people
don't take active part in things such as this btit 1,,
