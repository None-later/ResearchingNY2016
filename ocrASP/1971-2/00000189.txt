Groovy Gifts for Grabby Grads

Yes, I know how busy you are-cramming for ﬁnals, decipher-
ing your notes. helping old grads ﬁnd their dentures after Class
Day—but let me interrupt your manifold activities—cramming
for ﬁnals, deciphering your notes, searching for meat in the dormi-
tory stew—to remind you that Commencement Day is almost upon
us. and it’s high time you started shopping for presents to give
your friends who are graduating. So pause a moment in your busy
schedule—cramming for ﬁnals. deciphering your notes, raising
bail—to look over this list of charming gift suggestions.

We will start with the hardest gift problem of all: what do
you give the person who has everything’.I Well sir, here are some
gifts I promise you he does not have:

2. A street map of Perth, Australia.

4. A supply of Miller High Life Beer.

young eyebrows leaping in per-

pendicular incredulity. “The person who has everything does not

to Beer?" you rasp, your young

lips curling in horizontal derision. “What arrant nonsense!" you

But I reply with an emphatic “No!” The person who has
everything, I insist. does not have a supply of Miller High Life
Beer—not for long anyhow—because if he is a person who enjoys
a beer light but mellow. hearty but delicate, a beer that cloys not,
neither does it pall. a beer that is forever amber and forever
ambrosia, a beer deliciously dependable and dependany delicious,
a beer, in short, for all seasons—if, 1 say, he is a person who enjoys
such a beer—and who does not’.’ eh? who does non—then he does
not have a supply of Miller High Life. What he has is a supply
of empty Miller cans and bottles and a thirst that could turn

So of course we will give all our graduating friends plenty
of Miller High Life. And if you're looking for some additional
gifts. too. here are more suggestions:

 

For someone graduating with a degree in American history.
how about a hand-blown jade figurine of Millard Fillmore with a
clock in the stomach? (Mr. Fillmore. incidentally. was the only
American president with a clock in his stomach. It's true of course
that James K. I’olk had a stem-winder in his head and (‘hestcr A.
Arthur, as you know, chimed on the quarter-lmur, but only Mr.
Fillmore of all our chief executives had a clock in his stomach.
To be sure, Franklin Pierce had a sweep second hand and Zachary
Taylor ticked and Martin Van Iluren had a Swiss movement hut,
I repeat, Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Filllnorc alone had a clock in his
stomach. Moreover, Mr. Fillmore was the first president with
power steering. Small wonder they called him “Old llirkoryl")

(iradnation gifts, here is another

that Is sure to please~a gift certificate froln the American Society

each certificate is this enchanting

Is your tailbone nouI a failbono?
Has your Hflf‘i'lt III lu'cn (livlollyell?
Are you lmliny ver'lrbr'aliny?
Came right in and yet managed.

In your lumbar growing number?
Has your pelvis run a rouan
Does your caudal fem la rlaludlef
Come 71'th in and let all pound.
Finally, if you have a music-loving friend, how about a per-
sonal portable radio that plugs right Into his ear? Next year you
can give him a little pick to dig the plug out.
