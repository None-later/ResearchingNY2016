SUMMER 1971

Admissions View

The State University of New
York at Albany received between
nine and ten thousand freshman
applications, and admitted into
the class of 1975 some 1500
students. This year’s freshman
admissions were up over 11%
from last year.

Although an exact profile of
this year's freshman class was not
available at press time, Thomas
Flemming, Assistant Director of
Freshman Admissions, stated that
this year's class would probably
be academically comparable to
last year‘s entering Class.

Resident students in the class
of 1974 had a high school aver-
age of 90.6. and were in the top
7% of their graduating class.
These students had a 91.2 Re-
gents average and scored on the
average, about 226 on the Re-
gents Scholarship Examination.

There will be fewer commut-
ing students in this year's fresh-
man class, about 200, which is a
decrease of close to lOO stu—
dents. Commuters in last year’s
entering class had a high school
average of 85 and were in the
top 14% of their high school
graduating class. These students
had a 811.5 Regents average and
usually scored 204 out of a pos

At press time, admission to
special programs like the Educat-
ional Opportunity Program
(EOP) were still uncertain due to
the budgetary situation of the
State University system. Appli-
cations for EOP were closed in
March after the university had
received more than one thousand

applications for the tentative
quota of 300 students.
More than 4,000 students

applied for transfer admission to
Albany. Applications from stu-
dents attcnding other SUNY in-
stitutions rose by 52% this year.
The transfer class will Contain
800 students with the majority
of those admitted coming from
two your community colleges
within the state. The mean cum-
ulativc average of the admitted
transfers was about 30.

Due to a lack of staff and the
present large enrollments in the
Psychology and Sociology depart-
ments, no transfer students were
admitted to either of them this
year,

Overall, the number of appli-
cations to Albany State reflects
an increase of 14.3 % over last
year.

SUMMER 1971

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Co-op Offers Low Price Albums

by Tony Haul

Editor's Note: The following ar-
ticle was originally published in
the March 26. 1971 edition of the
Albany Student Press, and has
been changed only to update the
original information.

Have you ever wondered why

record albums
are so expensive?
It seems many
students have
and some are get-
ting together to
try and get a
non-profit record
co-op going on
campus. Think
it's impossible?
Well it might b8,
but arrangements
have been made
and the “People's
Record Store"
has emerged in
the basement of
Anthony Hall on

Although there
are definitely
many problems
involved, the
Anthony Hall
"Conspiracy for
the People" is
selling many al-
bums for a mere
$1.55. All "D"

Albums that would normally sell
for $3.57 in the bookstore will go
for $3.00 and “E's” for $3.50.
Stores similar to this one have
been set- up on the Stony Brook
and Buffalo campuses and are
thriving. Despite initial problems
dealing with a Student Asso-
ciation contract with the Fa-

I

 

culty-Student Association for-
bidding the licensing of those
selling items sold in the
bookstore, the future of the co-op
seems set for the year.

It may be noted here that the
Bookstore makes slightly under a
dollar on each record they sell.

 

(Because of the absurd pricing in
the Bookstore il‘s probable that
more records are stolen than
bought there anyway.)

The (Io-op people stressed that
although they still had to deal
with Capitalist companies and

distributers they were starting at
the lowest level to cut out profits
and serve the people.

“If students would get together
and organize their resources and
potential they would realize that
without that much effort they
could cut prices on all items they
blindly buy from stores making
absurd profits."
The Food Co-op
downtown was
lighted as a
definite example
of this.

The students
also implied that
they felt FSA
had entirely too
much power in
deciding what
students do on
this campus and
that if “We're
going to accept
that kind of shil
now without
establishing our
0 w n s e l f -
controlled in-
stitulions to
combat our own
exploitalion we
were doomed to
complete dov
minalion from
big organi‘
zations."

So help support the record
co-op and get yourself some good
music. The Co-op has a stock and
can get the album of your choice
within two weeks by order. The
store is open in the basement of
Anthony llnll.

The prices quoted above are the
prices paid by members of the
Albany Community to the Food
Co-Op, organized and operated by
the members of the community
for their mutual beneﬁt.

The Co-Op belongs to everyone
and everyone shares the responsi-
bility for keeping it going. Food
C(rOps make possible a savings of
up to 50% in many produce items
by eliminating non-essential costs
incurred between harvesting and
marketing of produce.

The Food Co-Op, located at il l
Dove Street, Albany, operates this

way:

Itemized lists are dittoed off and
picked up at the Co-Op store
front, filled out and returned
either on Friday between 3-8 pm,
or Saturday & Sunday between
l-(i pm. All orders are paid for in
advance. There is a 10% charge on
all orders to cover heat. light,
electricity and rent for the store,

The food is picked up on Tues-
days between I I am and 8 pm.

All work done at the (lo-0p is
volunteer. No one is paid to col-
lect the order forms, bag the
orders, or pick up the produce
from wholesalers. Since all orders
are paid for in advance, the exact
quantity is procurrcd from the
wholesalers. Thus, there is no
wastage, no spoilage. If all the
members share in thw work by
volunteering a couple of hours a
Week, the savings go directly to
themselves. Paid chasiers, deli-
veries, adVertising, clerks, stock-
boys, warehousemcn, spoilage,
and profit have been eliminated,
thus, decreasing costs.

The Food Co-Op serves the

people with better quality food
and returns the “profits” back to
the people. The Co-Op is a way
for people to get together and say
"NO!" to the stores that make a
profit from them.

Though the Co-Op is work 0-
riented, members of the com-
munity are invited to partake on
Fridays evenings at the Presbyta-
rian Church, 820 Madison Ave-
nue, 6:30 pm, in a “People’s
Feast." This social event allows
everyone to sample the culinary
art of their neighbor. Each person
brings a dish of food to feed 6-8
others Donations are asked of
those not able to cook. However,
"You can‘t eat the government's
'money."

The Bow: Street Food Co-Op, in
tits sixth month 9f operation. is
presently filling over 150 orders
‘per week. Households are en-
lcouragcd to order together to save
Itime filling and bagging orders.
Food Co-Ops, because of the eco-
nomic advantages and community
‘involvemcnt, herald a new trend
in consumer marketing. Withing a
few years and with the aid of
computers, all marketing will be
done in this fashion. 0n campus
residean are encouraged to inves-
tigate means of procurring food
through their own cooperative
efforts; help and advice may he
obtained from the existing food
co-ops in Albany. As more people
contribute their time, the list of
items available may be increased
from the present 30 to approach
those of a retail market.

Many things are possible. More
things are possible to more
people, especially those with full
bellies.
