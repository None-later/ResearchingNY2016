Sports at Albany State

by Bob Zaremba

Albany State University prides itself in an excel-
lent inter-collegiate and intro-collegiate sports pro-
gram. The Albany sportsmen bear the nickname,
“Great Danes,” and represent the school in colors of
purple and gold. The athletic affilliations of Albany
State include NCAA, ECAC, and IC4A.

As far as athletic facilities are concerned, the
physical education building provides seating for
2,800 in the main gymnasium and also houses an
enormous indoor swimming pool, with 240
mounted chairs in the balcony. Other facilities
include handball and squash courts, auxilliary gyms,
a dance studio, exercise rooms, class rooms, office
space, and locker areas.

Surrounding the building are 24 tennis courts, an
all-weather quarter-mile track, a football field, two
baseball diamonds, and several fields for soccer,

lacrosse, field hockey and softball.

During this past academic year, State University at
Albany's 10 varsity teams posted a cumulative
1970-71 record of 84-39-2, by far the best in the
school’s athletic history. Previously, the most wins
had been 65, acheived in each of the past two years.

Only two teams suffered losing seasons, while
wrestling (9-2), track and field (10-0), and lacrosse
(9-2) had their best records ever. Cross-country
(10-3) had its ninth straight winning campaign and
basketball (17-5) stretched its .500 or better string
to 16 years. Track, with its secon successive
unbeaten spring, now has won 24 in a row, while
tennis finished 8-] for a three-year mark of 28-2.

The five spring teams lost just 10 contests while
winning 43 and tying one.

Of course the big sports attraction of the 1970-71
season at Albany State was the inauguration of a
football club last fall. The Dane gridders, coached
by Robert Ford, chalked up a 2-4 record in their
maiden season, and will soon be in

 

ome is where

preparation for their sophomore
campaign. An eight game schedule
has been announced for the 1971
squad who will open at home this
year against Utica college on
September 25th.

In addition to the highly stic-
cessfiil Varsity sports program, the
University boasts avast and highly
successful intramural program,
involving 22 activities, and (‘lUSt' to
41,000 active participants.

The sports world at Albany is an

Contrary to popular belief, not
all of SUNY at Albany is white,
nor is it all concrete, nor, as a
matter of fact, is it all at Albany.
About ten miles north, just off
route 87, sits Mohawk Campus,
284 acres of SUNYA with not a
pillar in sight.

The tract, purchased in 1965,
includes three homes, four barns,
an olympic size pool, and a 40
acre lagoon. Charette House, the
central structure, includes a snack
bar, dining area for 45 people, and
a fireplace lounge.

Student Government

by Mike Lampert
President of Student Association

This year marks the adoption of a new
Student Association Constitution. For the first
time, the President, Vice President, and all of the
Central Council members were directly elected.

Under the new Constitution, the President is
responsible for all executive and administrative
functions, the Council for all legislative. Both
branches will be setting up subordinate groups in
the fall, and any student is eligible for appointment
to these groups.

These groups will have to deal with a variety of
matters: with financial matters; with controlling
solicitations on campus; with coordinating academic
programming, communications, living area and re-
ligious groups; with the conduct of the athletic
program; with running elections and many other
matters.

In addition to this Student Association structure,
which is responsible for supervising over 60 clubs
and the expenditure of $400,000, students play an
important part in the governance of the university.

Each spring twenty-two undergraduates are elect-
cd members of the University Senate, a body of one
hundred people charged with making broad policy
decisions on educational policy and advising the
university administration on a number of other
matters.

The Senate is organized into nine subordinate
Councils, which do most of the work. These nine
Councils are: Undergraduate Academic, Student
Affairs, Research, Personnel Policies, Promotions
and Continuing Appointments, Education and Im-
provement, Library, University Evaluation and Im-
provement, and Graduate Academic. All of these
councils (except Graduate Academic) and all of the
Senate and Council committees have undergraduate
student members. These members are appointed
through the President of the Student Association.

Thus, if you are at all interested in student groups,
or in participating in determining the policies of the
university, Student Association is an avenue to

achieve these goals.

Tradition Present at
Changing University

by Tom Clingan

Any school founded 177 years
ago has tradition. The important
question is, how much has persis-
ted until the present'.’ Surprisingly
much has, though not as much as
at private schools. Albany State in
the last decade has grown tenfold,
which lessens any sense of tra-
dition among both students and
faculty, most of whom are new to
the school. Alumni, who are nor-
mally the backbone of college
tradition, are generally inactive on
this campus. Though the Admini—
stration contains many long resi-
dents of Albany State, the men
generally running things are not
old SUNYA graduates, and as
such are not familiar with the
schools traditions. Nor are they
going to force tradition on
anyone. The average student dis-

plays the attitude that he couldn’t
care less about tradition, anyway.

Tradition survives in peculiar
ways. One is through institutions,
such as MYSKANIA, a group of
about 13 members of the Junior
class elected by the students. Now
only an honorary, it started in
1917 as the student government.
This traditional group now has
official functions only in other
traditions, such as Torch Night.

Torch Night is a ceremony at
Graduation in which the gradua-
ting senior leaves his/her candle to
an underclassman. It’s the logical
conclusion of the candlelight cere-
mony that the freshmen go
through soon after their arrival at
Albany State.

There are objects of tradition,
like Minerva, the plaster statue,
who is supposed to stand in the
Campus Center Lobby. Minerva
has Been around since at least
1888, and until recently was re-
garded as a meeting place (“meet
you at Minerva"). Another object
of tradition was Fraternity Rock
at Camp Dippikill, which has been
covered by undergrowth and lost
to posterity.

Events have perished in the
march of time, or have been trans-
formed. Thus "Moving Up Day,"
when Juniors became Seniors for
a day, has evolved into Gentle
Thursday, a day of peace, and
happiness.

There are new traditions, such as
Fountain Swimming, which have
become as strongly ingrained as
any traditional annual event. The
past ten years have wiped away
many of the old traditions, and
made others unpracticeable. But
the passing of these traditions
does not mean the end of tradi-
tion at Albany State; for new
traditions are replacing the old
day by day. Tradition is not what
it used to be, but then, Albany
State is not what it used to be.
