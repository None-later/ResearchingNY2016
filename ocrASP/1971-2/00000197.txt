New Guidelines
For S.A. Groups

In order for Student Association
to get started on a ﬁrm basis this
year, it is necessary for all Student
Association budgeted organiza-
tions to comply with a few new
guidelines:

I. There is a new voucher sys-
terri and a very complex new set
of rtrles on how money may be
spent. All grottp treasurers will be
required to atterid a treasurers'
meeting. The date will be publish-
ed iri the first ASP.

2, All groups should have re
turned signature and officer cards
to the Student Association office;
mailed in the
in

these cards were
spring. Extras are available
('(‘34o.

3. The new organization of the
executive branch may eliminate
commissions. Watch the first ASP
for details.

4. All Sltirlent Association distri-
bution voricliers must be handed
iii to the Student Association sec-

retary in CC346 rather than at
Check Cashing. Checks however,
may still be picked up at Check
Cashing.

5. All vouchers must be properly
ﬁlled out and must have wither a
receipt or a written explanation of
what the monies are to be used
for. No receipt tapes, for instance,
with just ‘merchandise‘ written on
it will be acceptable. Every item
on a receipt tape ntust be enumer-
aled.

(i. Each organization must had
their phone numbers in as soon as
possible. This will greatly help in
expediating rnallers if any prob-
lems would arise.

If any organization is unsure of
its present budget or of finance
procedures. stop in (‘ampus Ceri-
ter 346 and ask for assistance in
obtaining that confirmation.

Your assistance and cooperation
in these areas will be greatly ap-
preeiated.

the rock and roll of the 1950s. This period is known
as the Classic or Grecian or Grease-era of rock.
Sha Na Na lives tip to their goals visually and
musically.

They appear wtth slicked brick DA haircuts, gold
I.aiiie suits, triirlerslrirts and dirty jeans. They carry
packs of cigarettes in their rolled up summer shirt
