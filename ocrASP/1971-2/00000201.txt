Under New Management?

It’s been said that "everyone talks about the weather, yet no
one does anything about it." The Faculty-Student Association is a
lot like the weather; students curse the booklines and the food
and the services much in the way that most people curse bad
weather. It is indeed a relief to know that someone‘s finally done
something - about FSA, not the weather. At long last the Board of
Directors is taking steps to give new life to the much accursed
Corporation.

Of course, you can’t change the weather in one day, and you
can’t change FSA in just one step. More are needed, and, We hope,
contemplated. It would be indeed a shame for such a good start to
come to naught for lack of resolution.

At this stage, however, it is important to start showing those
responsible for the changes some confidence. They’ve begun a
thankless task. The new management deserves our trust - at least
until they show themselves unworthy of it. Years ago, when the
current leadership took over, they were left on their honor and
trusted to be good. Times have changed, and though we place our
trust in the hands of the incoming management, we're going to
watch them and see what they do with it. if they’re really that
good, they’ll expect close scrutiny and, indeed, should welcome it.

Them Changes

There have been a few changes in the Albany Student Press this
semester. Some have been visible to the eye, like the new headline
styles. Others are more subtle, like staff changes, layout changes,
and the resumption of twice-weekly publication.

That last change is a long story. We tried publication three
times per week last semester, and proved that it could be done,
However, the strain on the ASP staff proved too great; we found
that instead of being students putting out a part-time newspaper,
we became part-time students putting out a newspaper. Though
we still believe that there is enough information to warrant three
times weekly publication, we know now that it can be done only
with a larger staff than we’ve been able to recruit, and it must
involve some academic credit for work on the newspaper. We have
been unsuccessful in our attempt to secure the latter.

One thing never changes. This is our open invitation to all
members of the University community to communicate their
views through our pages. The ASP tries to inform all members of
the community and at the same time act as their forum for all
matters. So let's hear from you, already.

dollars by this closure. This is a riduculous figtire
since the rctardates must be cared for somewhere
and the cost will remain constant.

New Guidelines

indifferenCe to basic human needs, the New York
State Department of Mental Hygiene is attempting
to evict 670 mentally retarded adults from their
home and tear them apart from their families. 'l‘hcir
home is Sampson State School and their families are
the dedicated staff members who live and work with
them. Sampson is a large and open institution; it
covers 487 beautiful acres in the heart of the Finger
Lakes region of Central New York. There is more
than enough living space for each rctardale and
ample resources to provide a stimulating environ-
ment.

Sampson was instituted ten years ago to rt'lit'Vl'
OVer-crowding in other state schools. This over-
crowding has worsened during the interim at these
other institutions. The over-crowding is so severi-
that employees are risking their jobs to complain
bitterly about the hellish conditions they have
witnessed. The President‘s Council on Mental Retar-
dation has recommended that a minimum ol ltlll
square feet of living space per retardate be supplied
in institutions. New York State is supplying .‘llt
square feet in some institutions. Worse than the
physical jamming together is the lack of staff
members to properly care for retnrrlates. New York
State has not allowed the hiring of new personnel
since early last December anti the normal attrition

rate has forced staff levels to a point \vltui'e cur-n,

custodial care is barely possible, it is astounding to
realize the shocking conditions that these retarded
individuals must endure in a supposedly civilized
society.

It is more astounding to realise that the Depart
ment of Mental l'lygienc, Instead of striving to
ameliorate these conditions, will aggravate the tie-
ploruble situation drastically by closing Sampson, an
institution which is neither th-r«crowrlcd not under-
staffed. The reason for the attempted closing is
monetary. New York cxpchs to saw -I million

that one man, Dr. Alan Miller, Commissioner of
Mental Hygiene, is able to play God and disrupt the
lives and welfare of 670 people who are completely
at his mercy. No one has control over Dr. Miller and
he operates as a dictator whose word is instant law.
This man has shown himself to be cold and
ambivalent toward his fellow man and understands
only facts and figures which have no translation into
human feeling for him. 1984 is here l.'l years sooner

cilizuns have any power to fight a cruel, repressive
and unresponsive govr-rnment‘.’ Only you can supply
the answer.

and now iiilVl' their backs to the wall. in a last ditch
