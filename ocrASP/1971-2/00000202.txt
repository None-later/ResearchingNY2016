new things with this Arts Depart-
ment of ours.

It used to be easy to define what
the "Arts" news in and around a
University community consisted
of. One simply had to keep up
with things like plays, movies,
concerts and one’s obligation was
fulfilled. But there is a lot more to
the creative capacity of young
people than that.

We're looking for the poet who
wants some place to outlet his

energy without having to wait till
May before he can share his work
with the people. We’re looking for
the creative photographer, or car-
toonist who want to expose a part
of themselves to their brothers
and sisters in this Community.
We’ve already begun to hear
you. Things like a special article
on the role of comic books, trivia
contests, and iin interesting little
review column of sorts,wil| appear
as a result of ideas submitted by
people like the one reading this
article.

the increasing complexities and

But why crowds turn out today
for performance of the ancients

all the product of some very
subtle hyping by some very clever

'l‘he twelvri-man experience of
