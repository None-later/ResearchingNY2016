Boggs, Flanagan, hurt; Vido dismissed

The loss of several key players
has thrown a monkey wrench into
pre-season preparations of the
State University at Albany foot-
ball club. Head coach Bob Ford
faces a closed scrimmage with
Union College this week minus
last year's top runner. starting
fullback, and first string quarter-
back. In addition. another quar-
terback prospect has left school.

The most serious loss. at least at
the moment, is tailback Bernie
Boggs (Ballston Lake), who sufv
fered a knee injury in practice last
week and deﬁnitely will not play
in the first scrimmage. Boggs led
Albany in all rushing and scoring
departments 11 year ago. gaining
522 yards and scoring ~13 points.
Rookie Greg Finkell (Albany) is
the temporary replacement at tail-
back.

Quarterback Bill Flanagan
(Bethpage) is sidelined with 1|
shoulder injury, so sophomore
Rick Petty (New York) will call
signals for the present, Petty was
one of Flanagan's subs last fall,
after Bill broke his hand in tho
third game and sat out the rest of
the season. Mike Standish, a trans-
fer from Baldwin-Wallace, had
won high praise from Ford and
was considered a prime quartcr-
back prospect. However. in a
problem involving the transfer of
sufficient credit. he has returned
to B-W.

At fullback, veteran dcl‘ensivc
player Royce Van Evera (Albany)

is making a swrtch that will have a
significant effect on Albany's for~
ttlnes this year. Ford has dis-
missed Rudy Vido (Albany) from
the squad for disciplinary reasons.
The big (6-2. 230) fullback had
great promise and could have pro-
vided a real inside running threat.
Ford stated he had “gone as far
down the road" with Vido as he
could. Also cut for the same
reason was swing back Keith Ward
(Elmira).

Joining Petty. Finkell, and Van
Evera in the makeshift. backfield is

tur) at flanker, The offensch line
currently is composed of tight

Butler (Newburgh ),

Ford is keeping his fingers
crossed that the walking wounded
