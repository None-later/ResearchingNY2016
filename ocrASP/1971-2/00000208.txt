You have 24 hours to live.

Today, that is. So what are you doing with
your time? Are you helping another human
being toward the dignity you want for

you rself?Are you doing anything to overcome
the hate in this world—with love? These 24
hours can be a great time to be alive.

If you live right.

Break the hate habit: love your neighbor:
