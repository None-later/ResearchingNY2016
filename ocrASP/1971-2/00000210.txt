"Our Job Is Serving You”(?)

 

 

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

PAGE 3

FACULTY-STUDENT ASSOCIATION PROBED

--The manager of the book store
was asked to resign and will leave
his post by December lst. Further
resignations of high management
officials may be forthcoming by
the end of the academic year.
"Students at last have been
given a meaningful voice in the
hiring of key F.S.A. personnel

such as the new Assistant Dir-
ector, Norbert Zahm.

FINANCIAL WOES

To the student returning to cum-
pus this Fall, tqu of reform must
seem somewhat ludicrous. Meal
contract prices have shot up,
snack bar prices were boosted
quietly on the first day of summer
classes, the five percent discount
on new textbooks was discon-
tinued, and the lines grow over
longer. Things will get worse be-
fore getting better; if F,S.A.
Director Robert Cooley has his
way, meal prices will get a hefty
hike again in January and stu-
dents, forced to deal with the
F.S.A. food monopoly, will suffer
anew. Only President Nixon's
wage-price freeze, or II Board of
Directors' refusal to go along with
Cooley‘s wishes, will rescue the
student from another boost in
pricas.

Parndoxically, neither the book
store or food service were able to
make money. The bookstore may
lose up to $150,000; food service
will either l)l‘('ill( cvvn or sink ti bit
into the red. Both services Wt‘l‘t'

poration and tho rcvmiuc was used

blames the financial ills on the
new academic calendar, the gen-
eral inﬂationary spiral, freeloading

(in the dining rooms) and stealing
(in the bookstore).

But Student Association Presi-
dent Mike Lampert (who wrote
many of the reform bills last year
as S.A. Vice-President) thinks at
least part of the reason lies in
corporate mismanagement. That is
why he is switching priorities.

Instead of concentrating on cur-
tailing F.S.A. program items that
are of little direct beneﬁt to the
student (as Neufeld did) he will
focus instead on examining the
corporation‘s management. The
reasons are twofold: First, such an
approach will give time for the
policies introduced by the stu-
dents nnd adopted by the Board
of Directors last year, to develop.

A second reason is more con-
cise: In Linnpert's words: "Be-
cause students are getting more
screwed by the management," In
line with this, efforts will be made
to investigate allegations of theft
on the part of some F.S.A. cm-
pluyees.

The ultimate goal of all this is to
make management "more student
oriented."

SALARIES

The whole issue of executive
salaries may be indicative of the
shoddy way students artI treated
by the ('ot'pornlion whose muttos
is: "Our job is serving you."

It is worth examining lil'L‘llllst'

ation Illill is supported by thcir

Whirl this moans is that I“.S.A. is

of student credibility. (‘oolcy is

Unfortunately, lhcso figurcs lt-ll
only a part of the story. A int-m
ber- of llIl' Board of I)Il‘t‘t‘lt)l's told

this reporter that there are
actually eight employees earning
in excess of $14,000 and that he
was "disturbed" by the fact that
Cooley would release inaccurate
ﬁgures to the campus media.

The matter was brought to John
Hartley, Vice-President of the cor-
porationl and second-in-command
to President Benezct. He was not
sure if the number was six or
eight, and would not release the
ﬁgures since it would “serve no
useful purpose.“ He did not agree
that students on this campus, as
financial supporters of the corpor-
ation, had the right to know how
much "their" executives were
being paid. Instead, he will bring
the miitter up at the next Board
of Directors meeting.

He also refused to release the
figures to this reporter personally.
I claimed a right to them as one of
the undcrgraduute student repre-
sentatives on the Membership
Board of the corporation.

Not that the release of the fig-
ures would make much difference,
anyway. Some officials, like Food
Service Director Malcolm Corbiey
(who is one (if the "top six"
salaried executives) use a conven-
ient dodge. They put a few family
members on the payroll. At one
time, at least four Corbieys were
drawing I".S.A. paychecks. His
son, Butch, runs the t‘nlil’l‘ (Inm-
