Boggs & Flanagan expected to be ready for opener

Dane Gridders Shaping Up for Utica

The key question about this
season's football terim is whether
or not they are going to beat Irrst
yerrr's incredible record of two
trnd six or go under and win none
at all. The team has been rrrcked
with several handicapping prob-
lems ranging from trivirrl iir nrrture
to rather severe. What is lacking in
athletic prowess and experinnrn

hopefully crrn be made up for
with enthusiasm, strrltegy and il
little luck. Cotrch Bob Ford seems
to feel so.

The llCtLIilI rundown goes some-
thing like this. The knee injury to
Boggs
injury to quarterback

tuilbtrck Bernie and the
shoulder
Bill Flrrnigtm are not serious and

thcv both should be ready to play

by Phil Prince

by the first game. As for the
scrimmage this Friday with Mid-
dlcbury, Rookie Greg Finknll will
be the replacement trrilbtrck and
sophomore Rick Petty will fill the
qurrrterbtick slot. The dismissal of
six-two, two hundred and thirty
pound fullback Rudy Vida is a
tremendous loss but apparently

result of several skipped practices,
numerous other
problems but Couch Ford still
thinks a great derrl of him and
would like to see him back on the
squad next season. Flanker Ernie
Thomas, according to Ford, has
great attitude, good hands and is it
ﬁne runner. He does everything
fairly well and should be an asset
to State’s patchwork backfield.
The totrrl offensive picture, under

tardiness and

the circumstances, is quite good.

a few games under their belta they
may begin to look tr little better.

The first scrimmage was a
controlled game with Union. This
means Union was in control of the

with State in control, then ten,
