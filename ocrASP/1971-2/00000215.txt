editorial comment

And Now Attica

First the. riot.
Then the army.
Then the massacre.

The screams of the dying and the eyewitness stories
and the popular indignation.

The pious and impartial investigations.

The absurd declarations by the authorities 

And the inevitable whitewash.

Chicago. Kent State. Africa. Do we once again

demonstrate

and declare

moratoria and write

editorials? Do we again allow things to return to

“normal?”

Not again. Not this time. This time we march

downtown on Thursday and we tell the world that this

time we want those responsible to pay for their crime

of murder.

And in the meantime, find out all you can about

Attica and the forty murdered men. Before the press

begins to print the proclaimed lies of desperate men

covering up their hands in an attempt-to hide the

blood stains. For they’ll convince you that nothing

evil happened if you let them.

Remember how the Chicago convention police riot

changed to a “militant uprising of students" despite

the eyewitness accounts of what really happened. And

no policemen were found guilty. atid eight men found

innocent were sentenced for “contempt.”

Remember how four students were murdered by

the National

Guard at

Kent State. yet despite

conflicting findings John Mitchell found everyone

involved innocent of any crime?

Atid lastly. remember Attica.... remember it well.

and keep your memory of it alive. Because this time.

unlike all the other times. someone's going to pay for

the murders. And it‘s

not going to be eight

“contemptuous” militants, either.

WWII"

The breaking off of neilOtiﬂ'
tionn and the invasion of Attica
Prison by the State Police Mid
National Guard brought a 1’08"“
anyone could have foretold: 30
prisoners murdered and 9 hostages
killed; murdered by Rockerfeller's
and Oswald’s decision to invade
Attica. Murdered because at the
time the order came, the hostages
were safe and negotiations with
the inmates could have continued.
The murders started a long time
ago and spring from the roots of
our society.

Poor education, economic dis
crimination, and injustice all con-
tribute to the realistic feeling of
poor people that the only things
they can get are the things they
can Lake. In the courts and prisons
these injustices are intensely mag-
nified. Persons with money get
out on bail—poor people sit in
jails for up to a yeuriiwaiting trial.
People with money can afford
good lawyersw poor people got
virtually unrepresented. In general
SO'CilllCd white collar crimes, such
as pricefixing and graft. are not
viewed with the same harshness as
crimes of survival are. In prison.
an institution that few rich erini-
mals ever see, a poor person is
pushed even further from the be-
lief that he can attain a decent life
in America.

The demands made by the in
males of Attica clearly state the
problems. They center around the
prisoners wanting the kind of edu-
cation ncccssary for survival in
America; better rehabilitation
programs and facilities, uncen-
sored reading materials, better
health ('are, improved diets, addi-
tional Black mid I’uerlo Rican
social workers, and more political
and religious freedom, Corrections
Commissioner Oswald had to ad-
mil these demands were justified
and agree with the fact that since
they were ignored for so long,
rebellion was the obvious conse-
quence.

AMNESTY

To understand why the prison»
i-rs ltimli' the demand of amnesty
we only have to look as far as the
experiencvs of prisoners at Au-
burn, ’l‘vnibs in New York City.
Soledad, and San Quentin. Prison
officials first agree to consider
demands but begin repression
once the situation returns to "nor
trial." The mistrust Attica prison~
ers l'clt towards liockerfeller and
his administration was not and is
not different from the mistrust
you and I feel when they give us
promises. lloekcrfeller decided to
move against llll‘ prisoners when
amnesty was still an unresolved
question, an issue that was concise
and to the point, a demand that
could not be revoked or modified.
“furl this “quiet and ilecisive" ac-
tion worth the lives of thirty»
seven plus men'.’ We feel that even
if it took six months, conLinued
negotiations might have savutl
these lives.

THE I’AWNS

Just as the unrepresented" in

and out of prison lll‘l' victims Of
the society that exploits and usab-
lliem, prison workers have be-
come the pawns of the Slate
govenmcnl. They must answer to
the anger prisoners feel against the
government, and they are the ones
who stiffer the consequences
when the government neglects
needed reforms. Rockcrfellcr and
Oswald say they sent armed forces
into the prison to protect the lives
of the hostages yet 9 hostages rm.-
(Illu(l“llnd even now Rockefeller
continues to use them as his ex-
cuso.

WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TOSEE
Dltimutoly the only way that
prisoneru' lives will be fully hu-

communications

man will be through renewal of
the entire society. For now, how-
ever, reforms such as those de-
manded by the Attic: prisoners
are necessary, simply to mt the
basic human rights and mod: they
retain as men. Rehabilitation, no't
revenge, is what prisons should be
about. ~To achieve this end we
need a government now that is
less interested’in power, expan-
sion of private wealth, and public
relations—a government that is
truly interested in the preserva-
tion of human life.

To the Editor:

Attention athletic minded stu-
dents! Have you recently fre-
quented the physical education
building to play some paddleball
or basketball, or perhaps to go
swimming? If you have, you prob-
ably mel. the frustration rind dis-
appointment that l encountered
this past Saturday. The cage lo-
cated in the men's locker room
contained no puddles, handballs,
basketbiills, or bathing caps. It
had little else.

A severe recreation equipment
shortage exists within the cages of
our respective locker rooms. Ade-
quate supplies of handbiills, pati-
dles. squash equipment, basket-
biills. volleybirlls, and birthing caps
no longer exist for our general
use. They are frequently not avail-
able to be borrowed with our [D
cards. Money has neither been
requested by Dr. A.C. Werner,
Chairman of the Physical educa-
tion Dcpt., nor appropriated by
Student Association to acquire
new equipment for this
lil7l-1972 year. The mciigcr sup-
ply of existing equipment will not
be replaced when used up. Cons
Luci members of our studenl. gov-
ernment. Tell them you want a
physical education building
stocked with recreation equip-
ment for our use.

Nol Tasteful"

To the Editor:

For a second time, the ASI’ has
chosen to relegate the Inter-
national SLudenl Program as an
undeserving recipient of Faculty
Student Association funding by
indicating International Students
as one “...of the more wasteful
programs...” in the lead article of
September H. I would say that.
lhe international students are one
of the most deserving programs
under I’SA funding. The amount
allocated this your by I"S/\ was
34 Lililll, down $800 from previous
years despite the fuel that [here is
a 25% increase of students from
abroad attending SUNYA this
year.

FSA funding has enabled lhe
International Strident Office to
provide a four day orientation
program for new students coming
from overseas (“acquaint them with
the campus and community as
well as aeclimaiing the students
lroni abroad to it new culture.
This past August about 70 over-
seas students purlicipulcd.’l‘he sLu‘
dents ill‘L‘ charged ll $12 fee which
covers iiboul 60% of the orien-
tation cost. Included in the coral
tire. room and board for 20
Orientation Guides", continuing

who volunteer their time and.

energy to welcome these overseas
guests to our campus. The
remaining FSA funds are utilized
to provide continuing orientation
programs, provide ii moth-at travel
fund (mun-slate) for international
student conferences, and ii smnll
emergency fund for fiscal setbacks
suffered by international students.

The latter in important since tiri-

 

 

     

 

like the U.B. student. the non.
immigrant student has few re.
sources to fall back on. Justice
Department regulations severely
limit employment opportunities
there are no loan faciliticii
available and no public support,
funds are available for alien stu.
dents. For a US. student to drop
out for a semester or two due to
financial problems is often not
crucial to his completing his
education, but for an inier.
national strident it usually means
the end of his education. ’I‘mvai
costs alone to return to his home-
land would cnd chances of his
returning.

In sum, the modest subsidy
from F‘SA, I contend, is far from
wasteful. Is it. not the purpose of
the FSA probe to make FSA
“more student oriented?" The
international student program
subsidy is 100% student oriented
providing a SUNYA minority
group with services which would
otherwise be curtailed.

Security Story :
More Crime,
Less Power

by Dan Grossman

Most students at SUNYA equate the campus security force with the
invisible men who spend their time giving out annoying parking
tickets. However, the security force performs many more complex
duties than the irate students and professors who, having their cars
towed away, would think. Presently, the security force is staffed with
36 men. including a full-time investigator. and is outfitted with three
patrol cars. Under the leadership of Director William, the campus
P011088!!! making an effort to cope with the rising rate of burglaries at.
SUNYA.

According to Williams, most thefts that were reported last year

occurred in the suite rooms of the dorms. Cnrelessness is the major
cause and Williams stated that property loss to the university and
student body was OVer $200,000. Burglaries are the major class of
crime on campus and Williams admits that there is very little his force
is able to do other than to warn the students to keep their doors
locked. The total property loss may have been greater, Williams
believes, due to the fact that a large number of thefts go unreported.

With respect to drugs, Williams feels that heroin pushers pose the
most. serious threat to campus life. However, he does not believe in.
and will not use, undercover agents in his continuing crack-down on
pushers. Williams feels that "Lips" cannot be relied on and informant
types are highly suspect.

No Warrants for Campus Cops

Rumors have been circulating around campus that there has been ii
change in the relationship between campus police and other law
enforcement agencies. On September 1, under the Criminal Procedure
Law, security wirs stripped of its power to execute search and arrest
warrants. From this point on, only Albany poliCe, State Troopers, or
the Sheriff can carry out search and arrest warrants. Campus security
Cill’l arrest in spontaneous situations. such as a burglar caught. in the
act. As always, Williams stated, his department retains the power to
decide when an arrest should be made. except in situations where ii
victim demands that his department act. Arrests. be emphasized. tire
actions usually made only as a last resort. When asked if city or state
police could now enter the campus without informing security,
Williams responded that legally they could, but that they rarely do so.
Williams iidded that he believes his security force can handle most
problems arising on campus without outside intervention. If the
necessity for a search or arrest. warrant arose, the security office
would file for one downtown. Campus policy has been to limit search
warrants because of the possible room for error and fear of arousing
the campus community.

Parking Still A Problem

Keeping the traffic moving (and giving plenty of tickets) is one of
the major chores of campus security. William blames‘the lack‘of
parking space near the podium as the major problem: Officml parking
policy is to give thirty days payment time or be subjeclto tow-away.
To retrieve a car once it .is towed away will cost the indivrdual twnlve
dollars plus tax. During the calendar year of 1970, security towed
away 65 cars. Al. this point. in 1971, over 75 cars have been removed.
Contrary to popular belief. more teachers‘ cars are towed away then
those of students. A new addition to security’s bag of tricks
concerning traffic control is the gates that have been put up to stop
trafﬁc on limited access roads around the academic podium.

Increase in Crime Reported

Williams told the [SP that an increase of 60% in reported crimes
occurred during the past year. The time when security was nothing
more than a small night—watchman service is over. The problems
involved in keeping n growing college community crime-free have
increased. Williams discussed some new programs that he is instituting
to challenge the crime rate. Increased patrols of quad areas and
parking lots will be iii store and the expected acquisition of four more
investigators will help the overloaded detective department. Williams
feels that ii. is important that the student body realize that all people
who attend SUNYA aren't loving or peaceful. He isn't optimistic,
expecting the number of reported crimes to increase. However. more
manpower, improved training and better police methods promise to
make the force more professional.
