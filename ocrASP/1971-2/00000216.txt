Munseymen Seeking 10th Straight Wnning Season
Harriers Face Clarkson Here Tomorrow

When a team is coming off a
10-3 season, its ninth straight win-
ning record, and the coach r says
this year’s club is “immeasurably
stronger,“ prospects are bright to
say the least. That’s the view State
University at Albany cross-
country coach Bob Munsey enjoys
as he prepares for the school's
10th harrier campaign. The Great
Danes open at home against Clark-
son at 2 p.m.‘ Saturday.

“We have a real quality team,"
states the effervescent Munsey,
who has compiled a nine-year
mark of 77-15 as Albany’s cross
country major domo. “The kids

ran, Mike

are ,out to finish our first 10 years
of the sport in style, and spirit is
very high." There are some 30
men competing for spots and
Munsey plans to keep 10-12 on
the varsity, with the rest com-
prising Charlie Shrader’s JV
squad.

The top four runners in pre-
season workouts have been fresh-
man Brian Quinn (Buffalo), senior
Larry Frederick (Mohawk), Cen-
tral Connecticut transfer Scott
Abercrombie (Peekskill), and se-
nior Dennis Hackett (Hilton).

Indicative of the team‘s strength
is the fact that Hackett, the

Dane's top runner the past two
years, is struggling to keep up
with the leaders. “He's running as
well, if not better than ever,”
Munsey notes, "but this is the
toughest competition he's ever
had here.”“Hackett holds the
school course records for 3.5 and
5 miles and has 15 career dual
meet victories. Last fall he was the
first Albany ﬁnisher in all but one
of the 10 races in which he
competed.

Quinn, who ran a 4 :20 mile at
Buffalo’s St. Joseph High School,
is making a strong bid for the No.
1 slot his first year on campus.

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1971

Frederick appears to have re-
gained the form that made him
Albany's ton runner as a freshman
and sophomore,before suffering a
severe broken leg two years ago.
Abercrombie sat out last year
after transferring, but he is a
proven runner against. stronger
competition.

Strongly challenging the first
four and providing the Danes with
depth to spare are at least eight
men, including three returning let-
termen. The vets arc sophomore
Nick DeMarco (Voorhcesville),
the only Albany runner to beat
Hackett last year, but hampered
by a foot injury this fall; soph
John Koch (West lslip), and junior
Jo hn Stanton (Delmar).

Up from last year's JV team are
sophs Bill Sorel (Albany Cardinal
McCloskey) and Terry Slocum
(Horseheads), while junior John

Comerford (Troy Catholic Cen-
tral), is making a comeback after
missing most of 1970 due to
illness. He-was the top freshman
runner two years ago.

Boy’s High products Peter Payne
and Arnie Shell, both juniors from
Brooklyn, were star hulf~miler~s on
last spring's unbeaten Albany
track team. They are trying to
make the switch to the longer
cross-Country distances and
Munsey has been pleased with
their progress so far.

Highlighting the schedule is
the fifth annual Albany Invita-
tional, slated Oct. 30. A slightly
larger field than lust year‘s 152
runners from 21 schools is ex-
pected. Albany also will compute
in the State University of New
York Athletic Conference
(SUNYAC) championships Oct
23 at Frcdoniu.

Six New Men
0n Grid Staff

Six new assistants join three
holdovers from last full on head
coach Bob Ford‘s 1971 State Ulri-
versity at Albany football clirb
coaching staff. Only Ford and
Ray Murphy are full-time univer-
sity faculty; the others are prrrt~
time or graduate assistants.

Murphy, a Cortland graduate, is
one of the returnees. He is offen—
sive coordinator and coaches the
hulfbucks. Working with him on
offense are Jerry Brenhiser (Ohio
Northern), linemen; Rich Oden
(Florida A&M), receivers; and
Morgan Littlc (Delaware State),
fiillbucks.

Another

holdover, Dennis

Moran of Bridgeport, her-(ls the
defensive stuff, which includes his
brother, Mike, us lino conch. Phil
Grady (Norwich), in his sccontl
your at Albany, handles the sccori'
dirry. Rounding out the defensive

stuff are Dick Loornnr (Mont
clair), corncrbzrcks, and Pat
Pussulucquir (Norwich), liuc-
backers.

Ford, who led the (trout Dani-s
to a 2~l first your record, has
expressed confidence iir his assist-
ants, noting they are “somewhat
nrore experienced and mature
than last year’s group."
