ELP are the proverbial pio-
neers,never averse to new fields of
adventure. In TARKUS, they
experiment heavily with science
fiction, a subject that was made
popular musically by Jimi Hen-
drix. Side one is an extravaganza
about an impetuous armadillo
shaped tank that evolves out of a
volcano. ravages and pillages and
makes a general nuisance of him-
self until he meets his match. The
story line is nothing special but
the music is; seven incredible
songs pieced together with a recur-
ring leitmotif. The tonal colors
and textures are such that if you
sit back with a pair of headphones
and listen carefully, you can actu-
ally picture our armadillo friend
going about his business.

both complex and simple; in the
latter case ("Infinite Space") a
charming sense of humor and a
magical clan make his piano solo
sound so much more intricate
than it really is.

As with the first album the
musical styles are many and varied
ranging from honkey tone (“Jer-
emy Bender") to 50’s rock (“Are
You Ready Eddy"). A major
difference is the instrumentals
which are not long, cxlcnded
vehicles but bridges between ra-
pidly changing but smoothly con-
nected musical patterns.

A number of gimmicks are util-
ized but all with impeccable taste.
The Moog,(which has not yet
been used to anywhere near its
full potential) gets a good work-
out, Greg Lake's vocals are double
tracked to create a rickcr tone;
drum sections with echo chamber
accompaniment, Chinese gongs, e-
Ven electric guitars (Emerson u-
sually avoids guitars) are all just
right. In sum, the jigsaw puzzle is
ﬂawlessly fitted together.

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1971

Ian 8. Sylvia-
lead Off Saratoga Special

Kris Kristofferson headlined the
Saratoga Performing Arts Center
program of Sept. 6th, but Ian and
Sylvia, the Canadian folk duo
that came on first, nearly stole the
show. Ian and Sylvia Tyson are
careful, thorough professionals
who have somehow maintained
the energy, freshness, and

enthusiasm they first brought ten?

years ago to their trade. Seeing
them for the umpteenth time I

e

Side one is a masterpiece
though. The opening cut “Give It
Everything You Got" is all Sly
Stone funk; a grinding wah-wah
pedal gets the song off the ground
and then vocalists Jerry laCroix
and Edgar Winter trade off the
Vocal lines in respective growls and
shricks. The brass keeps the song
in full Ilight with a strong pace
that leads up to a saxophone
fugue solo. Even better is "Let‘s
Get It On" (if you can forget the
title) in which the brass again lays
it on thick in a well structured,
straight-ahead line. There is a fine
guitar solo by Bobby Ramirez
(not a note wasted) and then the
song climaxes with a harmonica
piece by laCroix who sings into
his harp. No artificial flavoring
here. Sidc one finished up with an
entcntc of soul and blues in “I've
Got News For You" with the
brass setting an outline for the
vocal and then going up and down
like a roller coaster on the blink.

Add another good song “When:
Would I Be" (also on side one)
and they almost have enough ma-
terial for a solid album. Unfor-
tunately there are slim pickings on
side two despite the prcscncc of a
lovely, evocatch vocal by Winter
(“Dying to Live"). The slower,
gospel numbers, pretty lame to
begin with, arc not helped any by
a six girl chorus. “Save The I’la-
net" is simply a throwaway.
"Keep On Playing 'I‘hal. Rock n'
Roll" couldn't possibly givc any-
one the inct-ntivc to do what the
title suggests.

WHI'IETRASH is a group with
great-potential (their bra." section
is the most spirited I've heard in it
long while) and as soon as they
cut down their activities to what
they do best and find their niche
they will explode on the scene. As
for now, they give us some bangs
but also a couple of whinipl-rs.

Concert
Board

An Open Letter to All SUNYA
Music Lovers:

While selling tickets to the Sha
Na Na concert this week, we have
gotten a lot of flack from students
about the new University Concert
Board policies in regard to ticket
sales. The purpose of this letter is
to acquaint the University
Community with these measures
and briefly explain why they are
necessary.

As many of you remember, at
several of our conccrts last year,
cg Trafﬁc, the Airplane, and
Johnny Winter, non-University
students caused problems by
rushing the stage, ripping off
microphones, and destroying ex-
pensive cquipmcnt. These new
policies have been adopted to stop
this sort of thing and give YOU a
more enjoyable concert.

In order to purchase a ticket,
you must present a student 1.1). If
you are buying a “tax” ticket,
you must. present both a SUNYA
LI). and tax card, and the names
on these must match. It is possible
for a person to purchase more
than one ticket at a time, but for
each ticket purchased, an ID. and
tax card (if applicable) must be
presented.

Thank you.

to display a sweeping,
full-throated improvisational styla
(aﬁsomehow more loveablc Grace
Slick)--things like that.

The enthusiastic but
sparse audience claimed them
back for two encores before
Kristoffcrson appeared. Kris, ably
assisted by his “Band of Thieves",
exercised his own special brand of
magic for an hour and a half.
Possessed of a rough, low voice, a
slow drawl," and a uniquely
washed-out Vonnegut-ish world--
view, Kristofferson’s appeal is
hard to gauge but nonetheless
undeniable. He obliged his adoring
fans by doing nearly all of his
better-known material, including
“Me and Bobby McGhee,"
“Sunday Morning Coming
Down," and the title song from
his new album “The
Silver-Tongued Devil and I."
Setting off his low drawl were the
high, sweet harmonics of the Bank
of Thieves.

I often hoped as the sol
progressed that he would display
some emotional range, which lo
this point is conspicuously lacking
in his performances and his
writing. The Il’cllunslmmig ht-
embodies is a more malurc and
less self-consciously melancholy
than James Taylor's can be, but it
is a fundamentally bleak and
hopeless View. To continue to
grow and prosper Kris will have to
move beyond that niche, clsc
audiences and listeners will soon
grow tired of him.

Right now, though, he's still
pretty powerful stuff, and the
audience loved him. After a
longish set and a wcll-rcccivcd
encore, he departed shaking hands
with his first-row fans. And the
audience, as both Kris and [an and
Sylvia noted, was jusl, beautiful,

'l‘inics, after all, have changed at
the State University, and one
needs no longer to guai'dcdly hide
the fact that he once enjoyed an
opera. We may even rest assured
that one can now nod understand-
ineg and pronounce a Schoenberg
quartet “heavy shit" without fear
of being scorned at by his loss
“into it" friends. In fact, it may
even impress them. Be attontivo,
