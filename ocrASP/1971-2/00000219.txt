by Glenn von Nostitz

On May it. l97l the University
Senate passed a resolution which
recommended that the University.
“commit itsell‘ to a university-
wide program in Environmental
Studies and that the administra-
tion be requested. with the assis-
tance of appropriate councils and
committees to develop sticlt a
program." in spite of formidable
financial obstacles. significant
headway has been made in estab-
lishing Cnvironniental Studies at
SUNVAt As a result of the Senate
resolution, the l‘invll‘tnlllll'nlitl
Studies Steering tlomniillee was
created. with Stanley lilount of
the Geography Department as
coordinator, The committee is
made tip of both faculty and
students. audits goal is to develop
policies and content for the ‘Iiivi-
ronnii-ntitl Studies progrzuti.

'I‘lie first item of business for the

are interested in Environmental
Studies,

Stanley Bloun'l resigned as
coordinator on August lilth. and
Pres. Benczet named l’aul Bulger,
Professor of Educational Adminis-
tratiott the new coordinator.
Under Bulger the committee has
been working to expand course
offerings, especially in the intro-
ductory areas. Bulgei' says that
one ol" the major considerations
Wits whether eourses relating to
the environment should be
grouped together in a "(‘enter for
Cnvii‘otimental l'iduealiou" or
whether these courses should he
offered separately, h_\' individual
departitients. ('ttrrt-nt planning
calls for I‘itt'lt department to offer
etivtroittiient related courses.

During the summer. two \ltl)
rotnliiitti‘t-s were formed. our to
develop courses dealing with the
social and cultural aspects of the
environment. and lllt‘ other to
deal with the scientific aspects.

The biggest roadblock to the

Studies is the lack of money.

Attica Deaths

by Tracy Egan

Approximately fifteen hundred persons, some
from New York City. Buffalo. New Jersey and
Philadelphia staged a spirited three mile march
through downtown Albany yesterday'to protest the
Attica Prison deaths. l’rotestors chanted, "People of
the World are picking tip the Rocks, so Run Rocky
Run," and “Jail tlte richI free the Poor." as they
marched. The group attracted passive observers in
the shopping district of Albany, In contrast Clinton
Avenue residents, mostly blacks. joined in the
chanting as the marchers passed

The Inarch reached the Capitol steps where David
Dellinger, one of the (Thicago Seven, spoke and
introduch other speakers. Delliiiger stressed that
“We are here in Albany to begin a campaign for the
arrest of Nixon and Rockefeller." He later asserted
that by this indictment he did not wish for
Rockefeller or Nixon to be sent to a prison like
Attica as "no human being should he sent to that
place, but this indictment is the only way to begin
the end."

Dellinger introduced Juanita Woodson. from the
People's Law Office. who read a statement. she
claimed was smuggled out of Attieat This statement
alleges that “just as llitler instilled fear in his
concentration camps, so is Rockefeller allowing and
sanctionng the same tactics to be perpetrated here.
Those brothers whose lives were taken by
Rockefeller and his agents did not die in vain 
because the uprising in Attica did not start here nor
will it end here."

Others, who spoke to It largely receptive audience.
were ’l‘om Soto of the Prisoners Soldarity group,
Charlene Mitchell of the Angela Davis Defense
Committee, and expriest, co-conspirator of the
Berrigun Brothers, Paul Mayer, Each of these
speakers stressed solidarity. 'l'he solidarity of black.
white and brown prisoners at the siege in Attica, the
solidarity which “middle class, church people are
beginning to experience with the poor. and the
connection between the tragedies of Attica and
Vietnam," Some claimed that "the tragedy at Attica
began bel'ore Oswald, Rockefeller or the prisoners
were born. Family wealth and skin color had to do
with whether you became g()VernorI guard or
prisoner."

Collection buckets were distributed throughout
the crowd but it appeared that only It small amount
of money was taken iii to aid "prisoners, families
and the driVe for acceptance of the twenty eight
demands" made by Attica prisoners.

David Dellinger ended the demonstration
sponsor-d hy the People‘s Coalition for Peace atid
Justice with announceim-nts of further demonstra-
tioits. 0n SaturdayI October 2 protests at dozens of
