Graduate Studies

Albany, NY. (AW—The State
University of New York has im-
posed a moratorium on expansion
of graduate programs, pending a
review by a special panel, SUNY
Chancellor Ernest L. Boyer
announed Tuesday.

Under terms of the moratorium.
no new master’s or doctoral pro-
grams will be approved for the
immediate future, except in “un-

usual or compelling Circum-
stances."

Boyer cited an “exceptional
growth" of new graduate pro-
grams in recent years. But, he
added, "now the time for re-
appraisal has arrived." The chan-
cellor noted that SUNY's graduate
enrollment rose front 16.725 in
1965 to more than 37,000 this
year.

“Excellence in graduate study
continues as our goal," the citati-
eellor said. “I'Iowevr‘r, these pro-
grams are specialized anti costly,
and unnecessary duplication must
be avoided."

He also noted that some tradi-
tional fields of graduate education
are not as attractive to students as
in thc past and that employment
opportunities are shifting.

The lit-Ids involved include the
so-callcd hard sciencvs, chemistry
and physics, for example, and
engineering.

The special panel that is to ntaktg

recommendations for the future
of graduate studies williirt the
SUNY system is chaired by Dr.
Norman Cantor, chairman of the
history department at the tumor
sity center in Binghamtnn.

The panel is scheduled to maki-

Victory for Nixon:
Military Draft Extended

by Carl P. Leubsdorf
Associated Press Writer

After months of delay the Sen-
ate passed and sent to the White
House Tuesday the bill extending
the military draft until June 23,
1973.

Passage of the bill by a vote of
55 to 30 came with surprising
suddenness after the Senate by
just one vote had invoked its
antifilibuster rule to limit debate
on the measure.

President Nixon's signafure, ex-
pected promptly, will enable tltc
Selective Service System to re-
sume draft inductions halted
when the old law expired last
June 30.

Another major section of the
legislation calls for a $2.4-billion
militttry pity increase intended to
improve chances for creating all-
volunteer armed forces by mid-

4 + 2 = More Responsibility

by Rob Lent

In an attempt to allow students
ltf assume greater control over
their living situation, the 4+2 pro-
gram has been effectively institu-
ted this yettr at Albany State.

The basic aims of this program
are summed tip in the meaning of
the «10's iitid ZR's; Community,
Cooperation, Concern, Communi»
cation, Relevance, and Responsi-
bility. Bob Brody, director and
founder of 1+2, intended that,
tlirouglt the exercise of the var-
ious responsibilities involved in
the self-govermnenl of their liall,
students would be able to find
incrc t-tl opportunity for "social
interaction and intellectual stimu~
lation."

Within the program, 4+2 sttt~
dents living itt Oneida and Onon-
daga halls tilt Ilidiitti Quad cit-ct
one member monthly frotn each
floor (or a total of (5 members) to
serve as representatives on a (Ten-
tral (fotiimittcc. lti addition, there
are regularly held “town meet-
ings" which are open to all 4+2
students.

Atnoitg the functions of the
t‘i-ulral ('omtnittt-c is the task of
deciding which special tintercst
groups to support. It is expected
that, in the near future, there will

fellow students would be able to

fantastic. So far, I am 'totally
satisfied," commented Peter Ger-
stenhaber, ti 4+2 member, How-
ever, there has been criticism that
4+2 is experiencing some etrrly
organizational problems.

The 4+2 program consists of
60% sophomore, 25% jutiior, and
15% senior residents. This distrib-
ution policy was adoptcd iti order
to perpetuate the program.

“People iti 4+2 are community-
orientcd. I‘Ittl't‘ one can witness
more opened doors and reccch
more ‘hcllos‘ than in any other
plttcc on campus." ’I‘licse were the

sentiments of Barry Gershon, auo»
thcr 4+2 participant.

Despite the obvious social aspch
of 4+2 (there are future plans for
trips, picnics, ittid gttcst speakers),
participants are quick to reject the
assumption that 4+2 is just ano-
ther “social club." 4+2 residents
are serious when they speak about
the self-government and academic
aspects of the program anti when
they express their belief that,
through the 1+2 program, life will
be improved in all dorms.

SUNY Voters May Apply
For Absentee Ballots

by Patti I’clagalli

With many elections coming tip this year and next. most iii-21 year
olds would like to exercise their newly acquired right to vote.
IIoWi-ver, the only wily this privilcgc may be pttt to use by students
living on a college campus is if they register with their home Board of
Elections and secure ati absentee ballot from the same by October 2.
This applies for those who will turn Iii before November it, 1971. If a
student will be 18 between November 3, 1971 and June ‘20, 1072111-
may register at his local board betwr-cii January -I, 1072 arid Mtty 2t),

1972,

For those potential voters who are now Iii and can‘t get to their
local board by October 2 there is still a chance to register anti vote. At
the (‘ampus (‘entcr Information Deslt there are request forms for
Absentee Registration and Absentee Ballot Applications supplied by
the Student New York State 'I‘cttchcrs Association (Studcnl NYS'I'A).
Unregistered voters must get both applictttiorts, registered voters need
only the application for the Absentee Ballot.

Request forms rnttst be postmarked by 11:59 I’,M.on October 2.
Ilpott receipt of the application the student must get the signature of
the head of the University and have the application notarized. Unless
this is done immediately be will not be able to vote in elections in the

near future,

Iii sortie tilhci' stains all voters are given until two days before it givvu
l‘lt‘t‘lllili to register. In ttlt tl|)t'li letter to New Yorkers bclwcen the
ages of IS and :11 Senator George McGovern of Sotilli Dakota urged
those interested In their voting rights to write to the (iovcrnor, slate
senators aitd assemblymcn and ask that the rcgistratton deadline be
extended. llowcvor. the current deadline is October L’, 107] and the
request forms are at the (‘tuupus Center Information Desk now.

1973.

Under the compromise reached
by the House-Senate conferees,
the effective date for the increase

was set as Oct. 1. But. the
compromise -not su bject to
amendment from the senate
floor-was adopted by the

conferces and approved by the
House well before Nixon
announced his 90-day wage price
freeze on Aug. 15..

His action leaves in doubt
whether the increase can be
granted at the dtttc specified or
will have to be deferred until after
the freeze ends Nov. [4.

The Senate’s actiott was a major
victory for the President and a
defeat for antiwar senators who
had held out for something
stronger than the measure‘s call
on Nixon to negotiate an end to
the Indochina war as quickly as
possible.

That. provision was agreed to as

a compromise by Senate-House
conferees after the House refused
to- accept the Senate's amend-
ment by Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, D-Mont., that called
for total U.S. withdrawal from
Indochina in nine months if U.S.
prisoners are freed.

Tuesday's action on the draft
bill, while not expected by Senate
leaders until Thursday at. the earli-
est, had been expected'since last
Thursday's 47-36 vote on which
the Senate refused to send the
draft bill back to conference.

The measure includes a $2.4
billion military pay raise, author-
izes President Nixon to drop un-
dergraduate student deferments
starting with those entering col-
lege this fall, extends procedural
rights of druftees before their
local boards and limits inductions
to 130,000 this year and 140,000
next year.
