Problems Face
New EOP Director

by Al Thompson

Vernon A. Buck is a new man
in a difficult and controversial
job. Succeeding Dr. Harry Hamil-
ton as Erectorxof the Educational
Opportunities Program, he has the
problem of how to satisfy the
needs of approximately 800 stu-
dents with a slimmed-down buds
get. Furthermore, the projection
for 1972-73 calls for over 1,000
students.

Mr. Buck stated that some of
the problems of EOP “were the
lack of performance data, the
apparent lack of awareness of the
mandated objectives of the pro-
gram." Students and faculty have
on occasion questioned the pres-
ence of the EDP on campus.

When asked how he would res
solve the differences and relate to
the sectionalized factions within
the BOP, Mr. Buck replied, "Too
much consciousness is devoted
to differences and not enough to
similarities. We are all deprived."

Asked to publicly clean up the
many false academic impressions
of EDP, Mr. Buck commented
that 801’ students are individuals,
some with heavy individual poten-
tial, and they should reach their
own personal goals.

Mr. Buck replied, “EOP faces a
tight budget, as the entire Univer-
sity is at this time--so E0? is not
being slighted or phased out." in
addition, he stated that almost
everything has been cut but stu-
dent support. Money is a road-
block: “there is none to experi-
ment with." But in spite of these
obstacles, Mr. Buck stated, “We're
going to make it."

Last on his list of problems
facing EOP is the luck of com-
munication. Mr. Buck stated that
communications must be im-
proved with students to make sure
correct information is given as
rapidly and accurately as possible.
“Students should be and will be
informed of good and bad fac-
tors.“ Since EOP students are
scattered all over the campus,
effective communication is imper-
ative. A newsletter will be printed
to provide general information as
well as announcements of small or
mass meetings. And, learning from
the past, this term each residential
area on campus has an EOP coun-
sellor to combat problems that
may arise in a campus community
as large as Albany State.

Mr. Buck stated, "The E0? pro
gram will be an open one this
academic year. We have nothing
to hide." Asked if he is going to
make known the problems of
EOP, he replied. "Everyone is

entitled to know the directions in
which EOP is moving." Mr. Buck
feels that EOP students, as mem-
bers in good standing of the uni-
versity, should be reminded of the
need to participate in all universi-
ty functions.

Mr. Buck will exert his influence
on campus, but will his actions be
"militant"? if necessary, he re-
sponded, he will carry out "those
actions that will be necessary to
achieve objectives of the program;
each action to suit the situation."

Mr. Buck praised the students he
has come in contact with so far,
feeling they agree with the pro-
gram and he noted their “splendid
cooperation." The faculty he has
found less warm (“There has been
resistance to change") but he be-
lieves that they will change with
the realization of common goals.

Mr. Buck is faced with demands
from many people. He feels, how-
ever, that his primary responsibili<
ty is to his EOP students. Next on
the list of his priorities is the
Program itself--the internal prob-
lems and the insecure financial
base. Mr. Buck, though, is well
aware that the EOP is a part of
this campus. Thus, he believes
that his commitment to E0? is a
part of his larger responsibility to
the University as a whole.

Central Council Votes

For No Further Appeals

by Katie Friedland

By a more than two-thirds majority, the Central
Council has voted to repeal all legislation author~
izing further appeal in the case of Stringer vs.
Gould.

The suit questioned the absolute authority of the
students to allocate their own monies, accumulated
through the compulsory student tax. The Supreme
Court of the State of New York had ruled that the
students must act in concert with the Administra-
tion, however, the case, referred to the Appellate
Division, was declared moot as there are now new
requirements concerning the allocation of such
funds. Student lawyer Sanford Rosenbloom recom-
mended that the appeal he dropped.

by Dave Fink

The second annual edition of
Albany State Club Football will
be unveiled Saturday when the
Danes host Utica College in the
opener for both teams.

Head coach Dr. Robert Ford is,
what might be termed, "cautious-
ly optimistic" about the Great
Dunc’s prospects for the 1971
season. “i can say with all honesty
that we are a much stronger foot
ball team this year," Ford as-
scrted. Fifteen players, both fresh-
men and transfers, along with 16
men newly out for the squad join
about 25 holdovers from last
year’s 2-4-1 outfit, to comprise a
very young team. "Wr- will have
only one senior on the starling

defensive. unit," il(l(i(‘(l Ford.
That's a go m bio.
The rigorous eight ginni-

schedule is filled with ours-lion
marks but State fans can bc surv
of a few things. Tho team will,
according to Ford, (1) be in as
good, ifnot better, condition than
all their opponents, (2)1)11 mcntiil-
ly tough and (3) have ii grcal rival

of pride. It is phenomenal to see
the spirit on the Ball Club. Whe-
ther or not they can be winners is
another matter.

Utica, Albany's first obstacle to
a winning season,will be a formid~
able opponent. They are a phy-
sical team iind they are big. The
Danes will know they’ve been in a
ball game.

As of Wednesday, two of (hi-
tcam's top performers, quarter-
back Bill Flanagan (shoulder) and
cwcaptiiin and star running back
Bernie Boggs (km-o) wcrc doubt

Last Saturday the SUNY Albany
hurrich begun the 1971 season in
fine fashion, taking the first seven
places on route lo defeating Clark-
son College of Technology, 15-50.
Vetern Coach Robert Munsey was
particularly pleased with the per-
formance of freshman Brian
Quinn, who ﬁnished first, with a
time of 26:40.

The Albany dual meet record
now stands at 1—0. The Dunes
hope to improve their seasonal
slate next Saturday at the US,
Coast Guard Academy, where
they will take on Coast Guard and
Montciair State (NJ).

Seniors Dennis Hiickett (Hilton)
and Larry Frederick (Mohawk)
have been elected co-cnptains of
the team.

Hackett, a standout runner
throughout his college career,
holds both the 3.5 and five mile
home course records by Albany
runners. He has 15 career dqu
meet victories and last year was

tln- first Albany finisher in rill but
one of his ll) races.

Frederick was named ()utstond

Boaters Take OApener;
Edge Potsdam, 2-1

Saturday afternoon Coach Wil‘
liam Schicffelin's booters defeated
a tough, physical Potsdam squad,
2—1, in the opening SUNY Ath~
lotic Conference game for both
teams. Albany's 1—0 mark auto-
matically puts the Danes in a tie
for first place in the league.

After a scoreless first quarter,
Potsdam's forward Bob Gaudin
tallied the game's first goal on a
fast break, with 11:02 gone in the
second period. Almost immediate-
ly, Albany forward John Strcctcr
tied the score with a kick from
the left side of the net at 11:19.

Each team then settled down to
some close defense, with Albany
hitling I)l|l‘ trouble spot midway
in the third quarter. Starting full-
back Stcvc Lcmmcrman was
downed with u spike—inflicted gush
on his left knee, giving a scare to
the Danes, who havo bccn suffer-
ing from acute lack of depth.
Although licmmcrman was forced
to leave the game, it appears that
his injury will not prevent him

from playing in next Saturday's
home game against Oswego.

At 2:07 ‘in the final period,
Albany's Demetrius Michael set
up halfback Uzi Haimoff for what
proved to be the coniest's winning
goal. Thanks to the efforts of
goalie John 'I‘haycr, who was cred-
ited with 12 saves, State was able
to hang on for the victory.
