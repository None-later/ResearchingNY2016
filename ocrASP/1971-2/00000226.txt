[The Subjective Filmgoer]

 

by Robert Verini

Above all else, it must be said
that Ken Russell’s new film THE
DEVILS, rated “X” by the Mo-
tion Picture Association of Amer-
ica, Condemned by the National
Catholic Office for Motion Pic-
tures, dubbed by Playboy “one of
the most vulgar films ever made,"
and the subject of enormous con-
troversy pro and con, is at its core
the most moral film you are likely
to see all year. For many it will be
an emotionally shattering exper-
ience; but those who are moved
but who can remain somewhat
apart and deal with the subject
matter rationally - and the film's
structure cleverly allows one to do

this - will find themselves present
at a complex morality play which
successfully comes to grips with
the profoundest questions of man
vs. evil and which can bring an
audience a great deal closer to one
kind of truth.

Sound impossible for one film?
Perhaps. On one level THE
DEVILS (now at the Delaware
Theatre) can be vieWed as the
struggle of an innocent man a-
gainst an essentially corruptliktab
lishment, as a demented nun
(Vanessa Redgrave) in 17th Cen-
tury France accuses a priest (Oli-
ver Reed) of being a sorceror and
consort with Satan, setting off a
chain of events leading to the
cleric’s torture and death. Digging

I found the biggest bargain in town at the Swiss Inn.
For only $1 idnu'ssion and No minimum they give 5V2
hours, full hours, of songs and dancing by the fabulous
Matterhorn String Band, plus they show old movies and
have slides of the words to sing with. What a fantastic
is at the Swiss Inn on
10 miles west oithc campus.

The real big bargain is the Gay Nineties Hour between
8 and 9 pm when they practically give the bar away;
why big 12 oz. draft beers only cost a quarter and all

My goodness, all ages from Iii-80 go there and what a

I understand they take some private parties also.
See you at the Swiss Inn, Friday and Saturday night.

deeper, however, we find that at
the center of the film is the
question of the essence of evil,
and of how it is possible to sin
against God by sinnlng against
man. Father Grandier lﬂlnﬂo'
cent of the charges
seems like a childishiy simple
thesis, and yet...how many of us
can say that we have lived our
lives with this in mind to even the
smallest degree? Perhaps man
needs the kind of awesome brutal-
ity of THE DEVILS to remind us
of our individual and collective
responsibilities «- that is why Isay
that this particular film may bring
some measure of truth to its more
perceptive viewer.

Of course, on quite another
level, the film may simply be seen
as a parade of the most obscene
and vomitous grotesqueries. It fea-
tures, among other things, nuns
stripping themselves naked in pub-
lic and committing atrocities. the
death throes of a plague victim
shown in graphic detail, and hun-
dreds of bodies rotting in a giant
pit. It is images such as these
which have raised such an outcry
among disgusted moviegoers and

critics. But I maintain that none
of the “grotesqueries” are thrown
in gratuitously, as Fellini did so
outrageously in his SATYRICON.
And director-writer Ken Russell
never oversteps his bounds. When
Grandier is being tortured, for
the mad Sister Jeanne des Anges,
but he is guilty of both compro-
mising his personal vows, thus
breaking the bond with God we
are all bound to make in one way
or another, and ultimately of
hypocrisy. It is this willful aban-
doning of his faith which con-
demns Grandier; in similar ways
the town of London, the Church,
and man himself are shown to be
equally culpable and equally
doomed.

Certainly THE DEVILS is not
an optimistic film. In overview it
is the depiction of a world turning
to shit before one’s eyes. Yet I
feel that by viewing and analyzing
the film there is a certain measure
of hope to be discerned here. Its
message is, basically, to be true to
oneself, one's beliefs, one’s fel-
low man, and one's God. This
example, we are never shown
exactly what is happening to him.

All we see is his agonized face,
and this enables us to feel his pain
and we can empathize so much
more with him. Russell never
stoops to out-and-out bad taste to
make a point. This is the differ-
ence between pure filth and pure
art.

The actors in the large cast are
uniformly splendid, especially
Redgrave and Reed, whose dyna-
mic, frenzied performances add
new lustre to their already distin-
guished careers. Special mention
should also go to Gemma Jones,
who is charming and touching as a
simple country girl who is en-
amored of the libertine Grandier.
Also contributing to the mood
and atmosphere of madness that
Russell and his actors have In-
|Jored so hard to create are the
superb technical achievements of
master cinematographer David
Watkin and art director Robert
Cartwright.

I have spoken at great length
about this particular film, because
I feel that of all the important and
distinguished efforts that have ap-
peared this year -- and there have
been many -- few are so affecting
and meaningful as THE DEVILS.
In its way, it may prove to be
effective in rooting out intolerA
ance, hypocrisy, and prejudice --
devils which modern man would
do well to exercise.

 

Name one
thing that
hasn’t gone up
since I950.

1. ______ ___

Try. Try hard.

The only thing we can think of
is what we make. The Swingline
“To! 50" Stapler. 98¢ in 1950.
96¢ in 1971.

And it still comes with 1000 lree
staples and a handy carrying
pouch. It staples, lacks and
mends. It‘s unconditionally
guaranteed. It's one of the
world's smallest staplers.

And it's the world's biggest
seller. Could be that's whin
hasn't gone up in price in

21 years.

ll you're interested in something
a little bigger, our Cub Desk
Stapler and Cub Hand Stapler
are only $1.98. Both To! and
Cub Staplers are available at
Stationery. Variety and College
Bookstores.

The Swingline “Tot 50"
98¢ in 1950. 98¢ in 1971.

If you can name something else
that hasn't gone up in price
since1950,lelus know. We'll
send you a lree Tol Slapler with
1000 staples and a vinyl pouch.
Enclose 25¢ to cover postage
and handling.

THE ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

by Robin Sagon

A large, black beetle crawled
slowly up the aisle as Iwnited for
the lights lo dim and the Hell-
strom Chronicle to begin. Ididn't
know whether to take this appari-
tion as a clever joke on the part of
the theatre management, or as a
consequential union of the mess-
age of the film I was about to see.
My rcaclion to the I‘IL‘IISII’UII‘I
Chronicle was equally ambigum s
- was il merely a clever pit-co of
box office nuinipulatinn, or b; .I it
a meaning for us?

Hellstrom makes a good case for
his friends, whose well-developed
social orders and carefully defined
roles make for little of the chaos
one finds in the world of humans
- “where there is no intelligence
there is no stupidity," Hellstrom
reminds. Termite mushroom gar<
dens, advanced genetic breeding
among many insects and whole
armies of ants building entire
complexes of temporary fortresses
do give one pause.

When I think back to the Slu-
dcnl Slrikc of May 1970 I rcmcm-
In-r Ihv thrill I had when soinconi»
proposcd that the Students of
America boycott the output of
lhc recording industry to gain
some lypc of political or econo-
mic power. I was extremely disin-
poinlcil to see the motion voted
or acclaimed down, because of the
numbcr of llighl<0n Revolution-
ary (lroups that would lose their
hip capitalist shirts if it carricd
through, I had no political feelings
about ii, you understand, I was
just hoping the American Record
Industry would get what it do
scrvcil.

Amcrican classical recordings,
l'ompnrcrl In their German,
li‘rcnch and English counterparts,
ill'l' a disgrace. Granted, the per-
I'nrmanci-s lhcmsclvcs are almost
always vcry good to excellent, but
the packaging and engineering ill'l'
nl'lcn atrocious. Consider Colum-

Hellstrom Chronicled

Our guide through this opus of
the insect world is Nils Hellstrom,
M.S., Ph.D., self-proclaimed here-
tic who tells us with maniacal
calm that “if one species is to
inherit the earth, that species will
not he man.“ llellstrom's obses-
sion with the insect world, (“it's
not easy to be obsessed,“ he tells
us ), has led him to belich in the
;uperiorily of his crawling, flying
friends who, unlike man, who
seeks to control his environment,
have learned in the 300 million
years of their existence to live
with and seek the protection of
their world.

The movie also raises some ques‘
tions concerning the nature of
man and insect. Hellstrom sug.
.{esls we could benefit by obser»
ving their almost oriental sublima-
tion of "ego" to the whole. Do we
take life too seriously, it asks,
living it tormented with questions
rather than “accepting the gift (of
life) and gently saying goodbye."
Finally, it asks the inevitable,
"Are we merely insects in the eyes
of the universe?"

The true stars of the film , the
insects, are as awful, stunning,
fantastic, bizarre and beautiful as
anything Hollywood make-up and
production crews have created in
the history of film. The photogra-
phy is magnificent and indeed
thrilling. Unfortunately, the film
does not stand on these merits
alone. We find out that Nils Hell-
strom is merely an actor (some-
how he was too charming to be a
scientist) spouting the evidence
compiled by “real” scientists, and
as a film, The Hellstrom Chronicle
