FSA Vending Machine

Operation Charged Illegal

The vending machines in your
dorm, in the campus center,
podium, and tunnels are and heme
been operated in violation of the
State University contract with
SUNY-A's Faculty Student Asso-
ciation.

According to New York State
Auditors, Article 3 of the contract
between State University and FSA
provides that “FSA may operate
vending machines. This does not
mean that FSA may sub-contract
a vending operation to an outside
concern but must service and
maintain FSA owned or leased
vending machines with the use of
FSA personnel,"

Since past and present vending
operations have been subcon‘
tracted in violation of the
SUNY-FSA contract, the State
Auditors, with an eye open for
additional revenue, naturally de-
mand all net commissions should
be paid to the impoverished State
Treasury.

On June 30, 1968, FSA entered
into an exclusive contract with
Canteen Company after competi-
tive bidding, Under the terms of
this contract, Canteen Company
services all machines mid collects
all receipts. Gross vending sales
for fiscal_ year 1970 amounted to
$282,957. A single check for the
total receipts collected by
Canteen Company is forwarded to
FSA which banks the check and

draws an FSA check in favor of
Cunteen for their share of the
receipts, amounting to $288,607
in 1970. The only purpose of this
cumbersome procedure, State
Auditor report, is to provide an
arrangement whereby FSA does
not receive vending commissions

Perhaps with the introduction of eiiv
avoided.

by .l. Stephen Flnvin

but rather pays the vendor “for
services rendered in maintaining

the vending machine.” This "you
pay me, I‘ll pay you back minus
my share" method is FSA‘s means
to circumvent article 3 of FSA's
contract with State University.

In June, 1971, FSA raised prices
in all food units. Canteen Com-
pany sells the same Campbell’s
Soups and Bounty stews at the
Snack Bar. The stews and soups
were being sold cheaper and with
no sales tax, than in the Snack
Bar. FSA food service purchaser
Dick Fink "asked" Canteen Com‘
pany to raise their prices accord-
ingly. Thus far, Canteen has re-
fused. Food service employees
Were quick to note, however, that
the price of apples were cheaper
and coffee better than the same
items purchased in vending
machines.

Profits from the subcontracttxl
vending machines partially cover
FSA losing services, particularly
the bookstore, faculty housing,
the Mohawk Campus, reception
and adniinislralive lulue and

parties. Profits derived from
students. largest percentage of
vending machine consumers,

could go for cheaper soups and
stews.

Dell Ward, vending machine
manager for FSA, says that the
university community receives a
sufficiently diverse selection of
products at a reasonable cost, all
things considered.

One of the main problems for
Ward and Canteen Company is
vandalism, which has increased
yearly. Vandalism costs, running
between 4,000 and 6,000 dollars
in i970 are absorbed by Canteen

THE ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Several corrective measures have
been taken to curb vandalism,
which Ward feels are best left
unpublicized. Canteen Company
does try to collect damage costs
when individuals responsible are
known. Currently, there are “0
sandwich machines because the
amount of glass seemed too
tempting to vandals. Ward claims
that the entire university com-
munity suffers when vandals
strike because the machine is
immediately taken out, therefore,
depriving users of the machines'
convenience.

Ward says that the best way to
control vandalism is through self-
<supervision of students by elected
representatives in the living areas,
as existed a few years ago, Much
of the increase in damages, Ward
explains, is a result of the rapid
“growth of the university."

Canteen Company officials
claim that they don't consider the
operation lo be a rip-off of the
university community. itemized
reports of Canleen Company
show that over two-thirds of the
sales were cigarettes and candy,
both medium profit items. Most
of the resl of the sales were low
profit itcins, soups, slows, and
snacks. The sale of cof a high
profit item, is under "v of the
total sales. Canteen officials felt
that the purchasing habits of the
students kept their profit margin
considerably lower than at places
where high profit items, soda and
coffee, were a much higher pcr~
centage of total sales.

Last spring the Committee on
Financial Affairs of the FSA re-
commended a study of the poten-
tial gain in income from direct

Table 1. FSA Income

The following figures represent the net in-
come received by FSA for all vending opera-
tions, including Xerox and washing machines,
for the period 1965-1970. The figures do not
include the salary of the FSA vending machine
manager and his travel, entertainment, and
convention expenses, a total of $8,000. The
income is only a smallfraction of the total
realized from vending operations, and it is used
for purposes other than reducing food prices.

operation of the vending machines
by FSA personnel. The sub-coni-
mittIsc of the Board of Directors
rejected that. reconiniendation
feeling that an average of 12% of
the gross sales amounting to
$35,000 or more per year was
better left alone.

Ward gives qualified support to
the rejection of the FSA direct
operation of vending. Ward
explains that his own personal
studies and frequent comparisons
with other university vending

machine operations showed little
cash gain possible, To organize an
FSA run operation, Ward points
out, would require a large initial
investment in machines and
goods, warehousing, maintenance,
creWs, officer delivery means.
Ward concedes that. some univer-
sities (Buffalo, New l’altz) have
achieved workable operations. lint
little savings in costs resulted,
Canteen's contract, Ward says, has
been renewed this past September
for three more years.
