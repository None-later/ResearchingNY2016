Every year the Parking lssue comes tip, gets argued
over, and is then dropped for the next ten months.
Somehow, though, new lots gel btiilt (Stit’pii'se, Dutch
Quad residents!) and people keep getting tickets.

Wherein lies the fault in all this? Who's responsible?
These are impossible questions in an era where buck-
