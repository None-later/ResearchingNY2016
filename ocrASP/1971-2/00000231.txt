You know the scene. You walk
into this gigantic mass of human-
ity crammed into a pit of a living
area with only one thing on your
mind, the possibility of seeing a
not less than fabulous concert.

But as we talk realisticallyI this
possibility has to become more
remote as we examine what var-
iables will alter your enjoyment.
Firstly, the acoustics have to be
shitty. You just can't get a tight
sound in a gym or converted
movie theatre. Secondly, those big
signs which tell you that you can't
bring alcohol into the place be-
cause you may be a deranged
homicidal maniac who has inten-
tions of throwing bottles at the
promoter can be a hassle. Some
people dig smoking, and can ac-
tually spend a whole concert
thinking about how good a cigar-
ette might taste. Lastly, of course,
is the enigma of the “sardine”
situation. i mean try to get as
many people as you can to see the
show, guys. But once 1 can tell
what mouthwash the guy next to
me used, (or didn't use) it gets to
be a bit much. You can tell that
somewhere in the front there is a
band playing. You're sure of this
because you can see the reflection
of someone's long shaggy locks or
flaming Afro on the wall in back
of the stage.

But take heart folks, the pro-
fessional music maiisolcums
known as “concert halls" are on
the decline. The rock idols hiiVe
priced themselves right into
booking trouble, and promoters
find themselves paying upwards of
$10,000 for a halfway decent.
band, and then having to charge
5-6-7 dollars a ticket. just to break
even on the damn thing. The,
music producers havr- begun to
look at the whole mess and say to
themselves, “What for?”

Probably the most iiotahlc of
these dropouts from the pro-
ducing hype is Mr. Fillmore East,
Bill (lrahain. He found himself
hooking clearly inferior
inflated prices merely because the
chances were strong that he t'illlltl

get enough teenyboppers in the
crowd to sell out the place. He
found himself attacked by a mon-
ster called "packaging." Simply,
what this lends itself to is a good
band only being available at a
decent price if a second act can be
included as part of the “package.”
So rather than get the decent
second act that the people deserve
for the price they pay, producers
have to take on these often infer-
ior bands just so they can remain
economically solvent.

So the producers are beginning
to look to the days of yesteryear
when music was handed to you
with cups of coffee or glasses of
beer in secluded, cozy little
places. You’d bring your friend to
this underground cavern of sorts
where you simply had to establish
rapport with the performance, be
it a folk singer, jazz comho, string
quartet, whatever. Guys in the
band coming up to tables bum-
ming cigarettes, getting into raps
with the people at the tables
about music, alcohol, dope or just
life in general.

It was a heavy scene in tliosc
days. My friend tells me ahoiit
this up-and-coming folksingcr who
used to wear this funny looking
cap to go with the strange nasal
sound which came from his lips.
In 1962, in places llki' (il‘l‘l'llWlt‘ll
Village's Bitter End, the club
patron could see Bob Dylan in his
natural habitat.

Or maybe you'd walk in on a
hot, sweaty ril‘l' lead by the runs-
ter of tenor saxophone beauty,
John Coltrane. Maybe a band
called the Great. Society was l'ca-
tttriiig their new lead singer, (‘irace

somewhere. It didn‘t matter.
'l‘hcre was always a certain essence
for all artists who played the small
cliih atmosphere that could iii-Vi-r

The J. GEILS BAND, a Boston
band that has been making a name
for itself oh the East Coast, play-
ed a free concert Saturday night
at the chapel at Union College.

The group’s blueprint is to use
the old classic rock n’ roll beat as
a backbone for l97l funk and
improvisation. They don ’t stick to
one style though, branching out
to an occassional blues or soul
number before returning to
sweaty, sledge hammer rock.

.1. Geils is equally adept at set-
ting strong rhythmic patterns for
Peter Wolf’s vocals or soloing at
rock or the blues. He is in absol-
ute control of his instrument,
although at times even he was
amazed at the magical acts of God
(after all the concert was played
in a chapel) that poured from his
guitar. in one solo, he parodiZed
most of the big name guitarists in
rock history: stride stepping like
Chuch Berry, making his guitar
talk like Hendrix, playing up and
down the neck like all the second
rate psyclicdelics do, etc. Organist
Seth Justman looked like he was
possessed by the devil, his hands
flying away in all directions.
Magic Dick jumped around the
stage with his harmonica; during

his sdlo on his back (two stage
hands had to help him to his feet
but don’t worry, it was only part
of the act). Stephen Bladd gets a
thunderous sound from his drum
kit, even more metallic than Mr.
Metallurgy himself, Keith Moon.
Along with bassist Danny Klein
and Geils, Bladd sets a different,
infectious outline for each song.

And then there is vocalist Peter
Wolf. Although the sound system
was good, Wolf's vocals were only
audible if one was previously
aware of the group’s material. But
that didn‘t matter because he put
on some stage show. He plays the
part of the [950's teenager, grab-
bing the microphone with con-
tempt, almost daring anyone to
try to stop him from having a
good time. Like all the other
members of the group he is part
put-on. An incredible dancer, he
shuffles his feet with speed and
dexterity, slid on his knees to the
beat, bumped ass with Geils, and
mimicked Mick Jagger, Much more
masculine than the Jagger image,
Wold had complete control of the
audience, often teasing them,

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1971

The very first song, “Sno-Cone,”
was a harbringer of things to
come. A Showstopper for any
other group, this song served as an
introduction to the group, with
each member doing a short solo.
What other group can you unme
that would include a drum solo in
thier very first song? Judging by
crowd reaction, the highlight of
the evening was the interpretation
of the John Lee Hooker song,
“Serve Your Right To Suffer,"
the one song in which Cells and
Justman took extended solos, the
former giving a lesson in virtuosity
and technique With a beautiful
blues 5010 that everyone felt
deeply. Then after bringing the
800 in the chapel all the way
down, they immediately got them
off their seats with a song from
their second album (to be released
in two weeks) which had a guitar
riff that sounded like a variation
of the old Rhinocerous instruA
mental "Apricot Brandy."

About two-thirds of their first
aibum (J. GEILS. Atlantic SD
8275) was performed including a
song co‘authored by Otis Rush
and Dick Clark, “Homework,” a
slow (for them) soul ballad, “On
Borrowed Time" and "Wait," a
story about a dude trying to pick
up a girl in a bar against the
bartender's objections.

Too many groups rely on form-
ed screaming or guitar acapella
solos to bring a crowd to hysteria,
but J. GEILS got evr-ryone
moving and shaking by playing
outrageous music. The group is so
cohesiVe and united, and so olr
vioiisly having a good time that
one can't help but dig them. They
were about the most physical
band l've ever seen, so good you
just had to laugh. The audience
wouldn't let the group leaVc,
urging them to play on, and after
three encores (the Smokey
Robinson standard, “First l Look
At. The Purse," “Hard Driving
Man," and a new composition)
the group was just too drained of
energy to continue. (lcils' hair
looked like a wet mop, oozing
with sweat.

(liven littlc publicity, the .l.
(ll‘IllS BAND has done a good
jolt of crcating a reputation for
itself. ’l'hcy really are it "can't
miss" group and I just hope they
keep llli'll' funk in the wake of
their Impending popularity.

The Subjective Filmgoer

CANALS AND PAIN

I suspect that those who see
DEATH IN VENICE will either
love it or leave it. Many will find
it, as I did, as delicate yet as vital
and alive as a butterfly emerging
from its cacoon, if I may be
permitted the simile. Others will
be stultifyingly bored early on
and will walk out.

Certainly when director Luchino
Visconti began to adapt Thomas
Mann‘s short novel he must have
been aware of the risk he would
be taking in terms of audience
response. Writers such as Mann,
whose work focuses more on
thoughts and concepts rather than
action, dialogue and plot, have
always been particularly difficult
to transfer to the screen; and
Visconti has, like it. or not, been
steadfastly faithful to his source
material. His film is long and slow,
sometimes agonizingly so; he
takes his time in creating a mood
or emotion, and what is left im<
plied or unspoken is infinitely
more important than what is sta-
ted. This of course placos a great
demand on the viewer, whose
intellect and imagination are con-
stantly called upon to fill in the
grips. But thc audience member
who is willing to meet the film
hallway and can keep his mind
from idly wandering will, i think,
find the end result well worth the
effort.

Dirk Bogarde plays composer
Gustav von Aschcnhack, iiiaile up
to look vaguer likc (itistav Mali~
ler (and perhaps it is not coinci-

dental that Mahler's Third and
Fifth Symphonies are used as the
m usical score). Ailing, and suffer-
ing from profound doubts as to
his ability to feel honest emotion,
which he views as essential to
genius, he arrives to recuperate in
Venice, and remains to despise the
vapid and shallow tourist atmos-
here until he espies a stunning
young man named Tadzio, who
becomes for him an image of the
epitome of all that is beautiful.
His growing reckless obsession
with the boy, whose only contact
with Asehenbaek is a series of
Gioconda smiles, compels him to
follow Tadzio all over the city,
and leads him to a barber who
persuades him to undergo a treat-
ment to look "younger." Venice
suddenly falls under a plague of
Asian cholera; the mascara'd,
powdered, pathetic figure con-
tracts the disease, and dies in the
shadow of his ephemeral beloved,
whose only response is a unfeeling
glance before disappearing into
the mist.

As we are swept into this misbe-
gotten quest for youth, inno-
cence, and perfection, we are also
treated with flashbacks dealing
with the failures in Aschenback's
life, as well as his own dream-fan-
tasies, all of which provide a
niulti-faceted portrait of an unfill-
filled genius who cannot come to
grips with those things with which
an artist must, be most concerned.
Bogarde is simply superb in the
role, doing more with the raise of
an eyebrow than most actors can

do with their whole bodies. He
employs a depth of concentration
which is absolutely essential for
conveying the agony of the char-
acter, and for those who appreci-
ate fine acting the subtleties are
facsinating to watch.

Of the other actors, Silvana
Mangano makes the most of a few
brief moments as Tadzio's
mother. Bjorn Andresen, "-intro-
dueed" as the adolescent Adonis,
might be said to have gotten off to
a dreadful start-how will he ever
live down that “most beautiful
boy" tag? But physically he is
exactly what is required here: he
may not be your own individual
idea of perfection, but it is easy to
accept him as someone else's.
Andresen really doesn‘t have much
to do except smile, stare, and look
bored, which he does very well; if
in future films his acting talents
-are shown to be as impressive as
his looks, he may have quite a
career in store for him. The only
really discordant note is struck by
Mark Burns, seen in flashbacks as
Aschenback's best friend and
“conscience.” Although the negav
tivism Burns expressed towards
the composer's life and work iire
helpful in establishing the con-
fusion in the latter's mind, the
performance is so sneering and so
relentlessly intense that be con-
veys nothing but antagonism, and
it is difficult to believe that Asch-
enback wutild let him into the
house, let alone call him a friend.
But consciences are always so
tiresome an lioW' Pinocchio

never really liked Jiminy Cricket,
until each came around to the
other’s way of thinking.

Since the film is almost totally
without dialogue, the responsi-
bility for its success fall, after the
actors, on the technicians, and
Visconti has chosen them well.
Cinematographer Pasquale de San-

tis does as much for the visual'

success of DEATH IN VENICE as
he did for ROMEO AND JULIET;
recurrent clashes of lively and
muted colors constantly under-
score the conflicts inherent in the
story. Piero Tosi’s costumes are
equally effective. As for the edit-
ing, 1 sense that the running time
(130 minutes) could have been
shortened somewhat without sac-
rificing the leisurely pace which
the director worked so hard to
create. But this is a minor com-
plaint in View of the total awe-
sameness of the final produet.

it is, i think, readily apparent
that DEATH 1N VENICE is a very
special film for a very special
audience. It says a great deal
about the nature of the true artist,
who constantly seeks perfection
and is consistently frustrated, and
says it in a particularly meticulous
and unique way. l find its style a
great relief from the frenzied,
hyperactive modern cinema we
are so often treated to. if one is
willing to sit back and relax iind
watch the story of one lonely man
unfold over the wide, blue canals
of Venice, he will find the film a
moving and unforgettable exper-
ieiice.

1 Clark Terry is a startling per-

former. His beautiful technique
and tone make any song sound
plat. Inﬂuences of Louis Arm-
strong and Al Hirt blend to form a
sweet, mellow sound in slow songs
and a herd driving sound for the
quick Iona. The use of two-
trumpets played repeatedly. The
use of his mouthpiece brought
stunned cries from the audience.
His personality is warm and, al-
‘though his singing leaves some-
thing to be desired, his perfor-
mance appealed to everyone. In
general, Clark Terry will probably
return to Albany!

Even though Clark Terry was
superb, the show started rather
poorly. The group was not at all
together and it seemed that Clark
was a policeman directing traffic.
Slowly but surely, as each number
progressed, the group tightened
and by the and sounded tremen-
dous. The trombone player
seemed to need technique lessons
and his solo riffs seemed contrived
and choppy. The bass player, who
deserves recognition, and the
drummer kept an excellent back-
ground for the soloists. The sur-
prising performer of the night was
Don York on piano. He provided
beautiful background for Terry
and played amazing solos with
beautiful chord changes. His
original composition proved his
virtuosity in not only performing
but in Writing. I feel he will be an
upcoming jazz great.

Jazz in Albany can be great if
perfromed in the ballroom. If the
poor lighting is perfected and the
microphones improved, the ex-
'perience will prove extremely
rewarding.

Miles Davis and the Modern

Jazz Giants (Prestige PR 7050)

l haVe always strongly objected
to the idea of having several
"takes" of one song on a record.
()n this album there are two takes
of “Bug's Groove" and two of
“The Man i Love," and if it
weren’t for the tremendous sta-
ture of the tiilent involved the
Prestige would never have gotten
away with it.

These trucks were first recorded
in l954 and Miles Davis' griisp on
the jazz kingdom was beginning to
get ever stronger. llis full brown-
ish sound was absolutely gor-
geous. His inventive mind was
consistently productive; so much
so that he was able to avoid all the
typical helping hands such as

 

screaming high notes or blistering

double time. On the contrary he
reduced his solos to the most
economical minimum packed full
of implications.

Vibraphonist Milt Jackson, with
that full glassy tone and feeling
for blues that had catapulted him
to the top is in evidence here. He
lacks a bit of driVe on his own
"Bug's Groove," btit there is an
iibundaiiey of it in all the other
tracks, most notably in "The Mini
I Love."

'l‘helonious Monk plays piano in
his own wierd way, with lierky
jerky broken rhythms that are his
trademark. He lays out during the
leaders stint because Miles always
found him distracting, but his
