This fall. when you and Sally Torque go to the big game with Purvis U., take along a copy of the October
issue of the National Lampoon. For the 75 cents you would have spent on a football program to ﬁnd out
that Billy Glefson, tight end for the I’urveyors. hriils from Mofongo. Indiana, and majors in port construc-
tion. you‘ll have something to do during half time when the Asher Ii. Durand High School Large Drum and
Aimich Marching Corps slides into John Philip Sousa‘s “Bataan Death March" for the fourth time. You'll
be reading a fifteen-page Mud parOdy; “125th Street," the educational TV show where those adorable
Muthas, Big Rat and the Cocaine Monster. teach ghetto children their place; “Magical Misery Tour."
which records the Beatles' trip to a land where all you need Is a lawyer; I"i‘he Final Seconds," a gridiron
gripper starring those inseparablq chums, Moose Nixon and Ruff Mitchell; and “Right Onl”, the same
campus war game played for years in army think tanks and radical encounter groups. And much more. The
Back to School issue of the Nat/anal Lampoon Is on sale at newsstands everywhere.

Computerized Book Check-Out

Abandoned in Library

by Paul Bachman
An ASP Feature

“Have you been to the library
rcccntly‘! Well. don‘t go. They‘ll
make you till out your life history
if you borrow at book." This
remark. recently overheard. ex-
pressed thc opinion of one stu-
dent. I‘lowcvcr, why do so many
other students find themselves rc-
peating similar statements about
our library?

Jonathan Ashton, Director of the
library, the computer- system

brary‘s book circulation was dis-
cussed.

Mr. Ashton stated that in Octo-
ber of W70 a computerized
check-nut system was put into use
ris :1 more effective means to
handle the enormous demands of
book circulation. Now. at just the
sound of the word computer. peo-
ple naturally think of speed, ric-
currincy. and efficiency. Right? In
the case of Albany State's library,

cccdcd to rent equipment from
IBM. at the modest cost of
$l200 a month. In the words of
Mr. Robinson. appointed lrist Feb-
ruary as Director of the Comput-
ing Ccrrlcr. the equipmentwas of
“rather poor quality. unable to
keep up with the library’s heavy
load."

Under the computer system. a
student who withdrew a book was
required to present his ID. card.
the computer taking note of only
the social security number. How-
ever. since the library lacked a
matching list of student names to
social security numbers. it was
unable to identify the name of
the student who withdrew the
book.

Another contributing factor to
the downfall of the almighty crim-
putcr concerned the computer
cards which identified. each
book. After ri sludenl borrowed a
book. its idenlificution card was
trrkcrr In the Computing (‘cnlcr.
which was understaffed. ‘flicrc
these cards would Irry in “lransrl”

llridit been his way. Ashton never
would have used the computer
systcrir without at least fur‘tlicr
preliminary study. In view of tlic
unanticipated increase in tipcl‘il-
tirrriril costs and the inability to

sion to abandon the computer
system seems like it rather wrsc

choice.

A feasibility study is now being
undertaken to consider reinstall-
'ing a computer system. One pos-
siblity which this study will ex-
plore is the question of whether
the computer can handle such
operations as the acquisiton of
books. as well as their circulation.
Hopefully. this study will yield
favorable results.

After interviews with both
Ashton and Robinson, one can
not help feclingihai a fiasco such
as nccilrrcd will not happen again
in the library. Although it is very
easy to list the failures ofa former
system. it is quite difficult to
suggest llrc improvements neces-
sary. Bill Dr. Ashton and Mr.
Robinson appear capable of find-
irig a solution to a difficult prob-
lcrn.

Prison Protests

Accoring to a spokesman. the
Daribury prison will be the scene
of the largest of the demonstra-
tions. According to Sister
Elizabeth McAlister. the origin of
the demonstrations “began in the
prisons themselves but. was accel-
erated by the denial of parole to
the Berrigan brothers."

Father Philip Berrigan is also one
of the defendants in the case of the
“Harrisburg Eight." He is accused,
rilnng with Sister McAIister, of
conspiracy to kidnap presidential
adviser IIcnrleissenger.

According to the group's spon-
sors. which vary from state to
state but include the People's Co-
rrlition for Peace rind Justice and
the National United Committee to

tiuns will also focus on “US.
