President Nguyen Van Thieu won re-election by a far greater
margin than the 60% "vote of confidence" he sought, South
Vietnamese election officials announced today.

But even as the ﬁnal vote tally was reported, opposition
politicians charged that the election was rigged. During the day
both anti-government riots and terrorist incidents were evident in
several locations. Independent reports out of Saigon say that the
turn-out has not been as massive as the ’I‘hieu administration has
claimed.

 

Despite reports of official American optimism that Nationalist
China will remain in the UN, qualified observers here find the
odds against the Chiang Kai-slick regime. A sigiiiticant number of
nations seem to be impatient with the China question and want it
settled for good. These nations see no possibility for settlement
except on Red China's terms—that there can only be one China.

Albany Graduate Student
Selected for Attica Panel

by Glenn voii Nostitz

On Thursday, September 30th, William Wilbiiiik
received a phone call telling him that he was being
appointed to the Attica Investigating Committee.
Wilbank, a second year graduate student at the
School of Criminal Justice here was “very surprised,
naturally“ at being named to the committee, and he
commented that “I really didn't think a student
would be included on the committee."

Wilbank was one of four student nominees from
the Criminal Justice School, All the nominees were
subjected to an invdcpth interview. They Were
asked, first of all, if they were impartial and
undecided about the Attica tragedy. According to
Wilbank, the most important criteria for being oti
the committee was that the person have no pre-
conceived ideas about Atti ~a.

Wilbiiiik added that his previous academic back-
ground also had a lot to do with his being chosen. He
attended college in Texas, and while there he
worked on a research project with four other
students. On this project he visited several Texas
prisons and conducted a survey among inmates and
guards. He interviewed nearly [000 inmates and 60
guards in an effort to determine why so many
inmates returned to prison time and again after
being “rehabilitated" The answers were diametrical
ly opposed, he says. The guards blamed the inmates,
while the inmates blamed society and the way they
Were treated while in prison.

When asked whether he thought the committee
was impartial, Wilbank responded that he hasn't met
any of the other committee members, so he
wouldn't be able to comment fairly. He did indi-
cate, however, that he fell the committee represen-
ti-(l a good ci‘o ~seclion of society and that he was
glad there was an exconvict. One point Wilbank
emphasitcil strongly was that he oiin represents
himself and not the students of SUNYA. "I‘m not
going to take a poll of all the sludnels, and then go
to the eoiiimiltee and say, "I‘his is what the students
want',” anil he adds that, “The blacks on the
committee aren't going to take a poll in Harlem,
l'ltlll'l', and say "I‘his is what the blacks want The
whole idea of this i'oiiiniittce is for us to make up

our own minds, as individuals."

Responding to a question about his own personal
views on Attica, Wilbank said that he wasn’t
supposed to comment on any aspects of Attica until
after the committee made its report. Even if he were
able to comment, he says that, “I wouldn‘t know
what to say anyways. My own opinion wavers as I
read conflicting reports. My reaction was con-
fusion."

Wilbank does, however, have some very definite
views on the condition of the penal system in this
country. He points out that 95% of all inmates will
return to society, and then asks, “If you treat them
like animals, how do you think they will act when
they get out‘.’ We say we are going to take a man
away for five years and try to ‘re-sociiilize' him.
How do you re~socia|ize him if the only people he
has contact with are other prisoners and guards?"

Wilbank endorses the findings of the President's
Crime Commission: “We need to get away from
large institutions like Attica, and go to smaller
community institutions. We need half-way houses
and rehabilitation Centers." He claims that. only 20%
of all inmates should he in maximum security
prisons like the one at Attica, and asks, “Where else
are we going to put them?" He is rather skeptical
about the proposal to build a “super-jail" in New
York State in which all the super-maximum security
prisoners would be kept, including the leaders of
riots and prison uprisings.

Wilbank pointed out the close correlation between
prisoner militancy and the new militancy in other
' of American life, including inmates, women,
homi.i-xuals, and soldiers. He cites recent moves in
California to unionize the prisoners as only one
example of this trend. He says, "I think an
iiiportaiit question is whether these militants are
really dangerous to society. This is one of the
questions I'm going to try to answer over the next
few weeks."

Many other questions wtll haVe to he answered
during the next few weeks Although he is confused
about Attica al the present, Wilbank is sure that
after reading all the reports, visiting the prisons, and
talking willi prisoners he will come up with some
very definite conclusions about the Attica tragedy

Legal Hassles?
Turn to SA. Lawyer

by Linda Mulé

Where can a SUNYA student go when he has ii legal hassle? Linda
lieventhal, a partner in the law firm of Rosenblum & Leventhal, can
help. Iieventlial is one of the attorneys hired by the Student
Association last year for the aid and protection of Albany State
students,

The duties of the firm, as stated by Leventhiil, include “counseling

the Student Association and giving them legal opinions, giving a free
office or telephone consultation to any SUNYA student who has a
legal problem or question, and making a first appearance in court and
arranging for hail if notified that a State student liiis been arrested.“
In addition, either Ia-venthal or her partner, Sanford Rosenblum,
come to the Student Association office, (‘( ‘lilG, eVery other Tuesday
night for free consultations with students.
‘ i ‘ ‘ LeVenthiil, a graduate of Albany
> High School, received her BA.
from SUNY at Buffalo and her
law degree from Albany Law
School of Union College. She be-
came a partner in the firm in
January, 106!) and has been worlc
ing With the Student Association
since last year.

Iii-veiithiil l'ei-Is tlial an import-
iiiit part of her Jul) is to give
students “good legal advice to
start wnh when they don't know
where to turn." She described
herself as an ombudsman » some-
one who “siiioothes things out"
for the students.

Ia-veiillial's office receives 10 to
15 calls a day from SUNYA slur

ences are held with students each

the firm hasn't handled many
criminal cases involving students,
Iii-Vcnthal said. Often she sends
students to Small Claims Court in
downtown Albany. “It's very
good for students - they receive
quick justice without it lawyer aiiil
are working within the s cm and
getting what they want," she add»

Not all the problems Leveiithal
helps solve are legal ones “Slu-

ple, she has helped students work
