A Ripoff Guide

Have you noticed the latest giveaway on campus, the Student
Buyer's Guide 1 For those of you from civilized areas, it’s a sort
of student form of Pennysaver. it is nearly l00 per cent
advertising, except for a calendar of events culled, one would
suspect, from other area papers.

We don‘t want to bore you with history, but there are some
-factors this situation you should know. Mr. David A. Cavanaiigh, a
former advertising manager of a small local newspaper, approach-

ed the ASP last year

about a sort of advertising co-operativc.

Most of the other area college newspapers. along with the ASP
would trust Mr. Cavanaugh to bring iit all their local advertising.
For most college papers, local ads are becoming increasingly
important as a source of revenue. The advertising rates were
raised, of course, to cover Mr. Cavanaugh‘s commission. Unfortu-
nately, the ASP had to leave the cooperative because Mr.
Cavanaugh could not generate the high volume of advertising
necessary to sustain us. The others, however, arm to depend on

him more and more.

Last summer, Mr. (‘avanaugh began to work on, you guessed it.
the Student Buyer '3 Guide . He sent all of his advertisers, who had
been advertising in the college papers, a letter which said, in
effect, “Why advertise with them, when you cart advertise in my
Buyer's Guide for a much lower price?" Not surprisingly. they
did. And, not surprisingly, the area college newspapers are dying
for lack of ads. The ASP. larger in size and frequency, is not
affected, but we still‘ feel that Mr. (‘avattaugh (“D/1C lintcrpris-
es") and his Editor (alias?) Mike Jacobson are destroying the
school newspapers to make a buck.

“The response to the (iiiidc was really fantastic," says Mr.
Jacobson in his letter to students. it certainly was. action by
campus newspapers got him and his ird slicci banned from RM
and Sierra (‘ollcgc iiftcr only a single isstic. So far he has been
banned as well from Schenectady ('oriinttmity College. as more
students realize the damage being wrought by Mr. ('avaniiiigh.

Sincc our own student government is most reluctant to take
action. we ask that each student coirccrncd wrtlr the survtval ol~
campus newspapers simply take their copy (better still take
several land deposit ll (Ilicml lllltlpcllL‘ti III the nearest trash can.

4+2=Frcrt?
To the Editor:

Bob Lent’s article in the September 24, 1971 ASP
told about the fine life style of 4+2 residents. The
“Albany Commune” does have a good program, but
it isn‘t as unique and innovative as many believe. He
could have been describing it sorority or frater-
nity; many of the “new” activities in 4+2 have
been a part of greek life for years.

In the greek section of i1 dorm there are communi-
ty papers and records. Weekly business meetings are
comparable to 4+2 "town meetings." The dorms are
self-governed and friendly. Doors are kept open and
the residents plan activities together.

True, one must be chosen to be a greek but -t+2
can only accommodate certain number also. Unfor-
tunately both are selective. However, with the
different sororities and fraternities a student should
fitid one with the same interests. 1+2 can only take
enough to fill the two dorms

Greeks art.- notorious for [)0ng social organiza-
tions. The members do have parties, weekends and
trips, but like 4+2 this is not the only reason for
their existence. Tire groups sponsor community
service projects, movies, food ftlsls, and speakers.
They are constantly planning events that artI open
to the rest of the univvrsity.

it appears that 1+2, iit least in its early stages. is
aimed at providing for its members. Fraternities and
sororities fulfill this purpose as wcll as involving
outsiders.

The one apparent advantage to 4+2 is coed
housing, but many residents say in the and it mnsz
little difference in intuructiou whether the opposite
sex lives down the corridor or in the next dorm.

4+2 is It great idea and hopefully more dorms can
he organized in this manner, but it must be noted it
isn't the first of its kind at SUNYA.
