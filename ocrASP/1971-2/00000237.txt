"I Think We'reAII 80205 On This Bus"

Story and Graphic by Art Kleiner

There are people on this Earth—even on this
campus— who preface each remark with “Shoes for
Industry!" or "The same old place? Oh. you must
mean the old Same place!" People who spend hours
discussing the literary allusions made by Ralph
Spoilsport. People who spend days listening, over and
over ad nauseum, to a_set of albums loosely deﬁned
as “humor” albums. ‘Such people are known as
Firesign Theatre freaks.

The Fireslgn Theatre consists of four men from
California who are responsible for a radio program,
periodic record albums, and at least one movie.
(Zachariah) The occasion of this article is the release
of their fourth album, “I Think We’re All Bozos on
this Bus". (Columbia 030 737) It deals with the fair
of the future and the efforts of one man to dominate
the computerized machines that control the future.
The third album, “Don’t Crush that Dwarf, Hand me
the Pliers", (Columbia C30 102) presents early-
morning television (“Here’s a line of Indians leaving
Rancho Malario to make room for YOUI") as seen
through the eyes of George L. Tirebiter, who also
participates in some of the programs. Before that
came “All Hail Marx and Lennon". Half of this is a
perfect parody of old-time radio detective serials. The
other side is, I think, indescribable. It shows as its
best the Firesign Theatre's ability to warp time,
events, and space. Ralph Spoilsport is the salesman
whose sales talks framcthis side. His last pitch,”Lids
and kilos...that fabulous Yucatan Blue, scored to you
from the sky-blue waters of that beautiful Mexican
bay", ends with the last words of James Joyce’s
Ulysees.

The first album, “Waiting for the Electrician or
Someone Like Him", is not as perfectly assembled as
the others, but is perhaps the most politically aware.
In the mid-sixties, when Indian mistreatment was not
a very hot issue, they devoted most of one side to an
audial history of the pushing back of the Indians.

stand-up comedy routines—and they usually don't
work. Firesign Theatre takes a situation, and presents
only the oral side of it, so we have to think to
understand what‘s happening; then throws in incon-
gruities, puns, and absurdities whenever possible, and
makes ample and perfect use of sound effects and
voice inflections.

The skills, puns and humor styles deVeloped in the
early albums reach a peak in the fourth album. At
first listening, it doesn’t seem as entertaining as the
others; the puns and quips are not as prevalent,
although still there. as in a section that. parodies
World's Fair-type science rides: “Animals without
backbones his from each other or fell down. Clamo-
saurs and eysterettes appeared as appetizers. Then
came the sponges, which sucked up about ten percent
of all |ife...And so... in fear and hot water... Man is
born!"

But much of the rest of the album seems incompre-
hensible at first. The Science ride ends with a
demonstration of a real working model government
("Look at that! It heard the word ‘power' and it
responded just like we do!"). The final attraction is a
computerized President, who answers one question
from each rider electronically. The protagonist, Clem,
uses this question session to begin a confrontation
with the whole computerized system behind the fair,
and at this point the Firesign Theatre transcends mere
humor and begins to deal with expectations of our
real future. In the end, when Clem seems to destroy
the machines by absurdity, ("Why does the porridge-
bird lay its eggs in the air‘.’") we feel a sense of joy
even though we don't understand fully the exact
events taking place.

In short, "I Think We‘re All Bozo's on This Bus" is
an entertaining and thought-provoking experience,
although some Firesign freaks prefer the more tradi»
tional albums, I recommend the Firesiin Theatre
strongly to anyone who has a sense of satire and an
agile mind—they can inspire the kind of loyalty
given only to those who arc at the top of their field.

This album is a disaster. Every-
thing that made the Airplane a
signiﬁcant musical force is lack-
ing. Marty Balin, founder and
leader, left the band late in the
spring... now we know why.
Grace’s voice is a hoarscr, lcadcn
remnant ofitself, her songwriting
has turned lcaden and her vocal
mannerisms a parody of them-
selves. New drummer Joey
Covington's work is as mediocre
as Spencer Drydcn's ever was, and

ludicrous. The major portion of

blame for this disaster, though,
rests with Paul Kuntner, Every
excess manifest on the Starship
album returns sevenfold here~
pretensious, arrogant lyrics, un-
melodic melodies, inane strum
guitar, and a dreadfully flat sing-
ing style.

Even Jack and Jorma can‘t save
the monstrosity. When Jorma has
center-stage (on 3 of his own
songs) the music is fine, but it
isn’t Airplane music, it‘s Bectric-
Hot-Tuna music, complete with
Jorma and Papa John chasing each

Leo Kottkc on record. lilld I'd call him some of the sweetest l2-string

Okay. so we still have that accouslically frightful gym of ours to
