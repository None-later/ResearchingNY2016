from Valley Stream is it sopho-
more here and has registered to
vote and joined the Democratic
Party. Edyee was asked if she
would prefer to be enrolled in her
hometown or in Albany. “It
doesn't make any difference, does
it? If it does I'd vote at home
..,l'm interested in the politics
there and the schools-J think I
might end up teaching." Edyce
believes the newly enfriinchised
voters will take advantage of their
right “.,.for the first two years.
Parents seem to get apathetic, l
assume young Voters will fall into
the same rut. i hope not."

Didn’t Register

«lltllltll' l‘illcn \Viilslegcl, ll), of
Kingston, NY. did not register to
vote “because I don't really think
that the personal ballot means
.iiiylliiiig,..Voting now is like pick-
ing the least of two evils. ’l‘licrc‘s
really no choice and my personal
ballot doesn't mean anything."
Although l'Illcn will not be able to
vote, she feels her peers Will exerr
cise their priVIli-gc to vote and
tliiil "it probably will" have an
effect (in the political scene. Hlt

ldoii't think all of them will. 'l'oo

Registered
Republican

Michael Anderson, 19, is from
Albany and has registered as a
Republican because he doesn't
want to see the school hoiird go
Democratic. He points out that
the authorities have discouraged
some students from registering: “I
know one pcrsoii who has fulfilled
the residency requirement and
Went to enroll, and they gave her
a really big runarouiid. They gave
some really insignificant reason to
keep her from registering," Andi-r-
think many young

Editor‘s Note

On Tuesday and Wednesday Uflllftt week two ASP reporters and
two photographers went foth to discover if the average “podium
person" here at State had registered to vote as well as to ﬁnd out
a few other facts about the latest group to be enfranchiued.

 

 

Some Have
Been Hassled

Eileen Goodrich also cited ex-
amplcs of students being discour-
aged from registering, and says
that this is one reason why she
hasn't registered herself. “My ex-
roommiilc got into a hassle when
she registered to vote because
they said she had to vote in her
home town. She's been living here
for at leiist 10 months and she's
really interested in things going on
here," Eileen argues that students
should be able to Vote in Albany:
“I'm just not into Voting at home,
[don't know and don't care aboth
who's running." Commenting on
whether young people will vote,
she says that, l‘l think the older
people areworried about us form-
ing a giant coalition and voting
against cVerybody - it's ridiculous,
because you can't even get. every-
body to go to a concert together -
let alone vote together." She feels
that students could make it differs
t'lll'l‘ in politics, but doesn't feel
that it is likely to, Eileen is 18,
and is from a town near Buffalo
.. “Not Attica". she adds.

It’s All A
Waste of Time

A graduate student here, .l'iiii
Keiiina, has some Very definite
Views on registering. He says that
he hasn't registered, "lit-c: Isc it's
all it waste of time. Ewr since the
‘68 elections ~ chr since I saw
what happened then - I've realized
it's nothing but ii waste of time."
He claims tliiil, "You‘re not going
to be able to change anything. lt'ii
too controlled by machine people,
and the Republicans and Demo-
(‘I‘lllh‘ are equally bad. You'd have
to assassinate them all." Kenina
feels that, "You biiVe ii toy in
voting at in," and lie sums it all
up quite succinctly by saying. “l
really don't care about anything
anymore."

John Rodriquez
Didn’t Get
Around to It

John Rodriguez says that he just
didn't get around to registering.
He feels that students should be
able to Vote in Albany because
“it's so much more convenient.“
lie is pessimistic on the question
ol' participation: “l just don't

think they'll get out and vote,"
and he feels that young people
will have no effect in politics.

Intended to
Register But...

"I had intended to register Sat-
urday, but got hung up here in
Albany. l was going down to llll'
Bronx to do it.” This was the
reason given by Michael Smith,
2], for not registering, He should
bc able to vote in Albany because
“I live off-campus“ and he thinks
that some young people will vote,
but, he says, "From what i under-
stand, registration hasn't been up
to expectations" Students will be
able to effect political change
only "if all of them get out there
and Vote."
