Harriers Edge RPI, Siena

by Ira Mozille
Brian Quinn, the outstanding
freshman star on Coach Munsey's
cross-country team missed the
course record at RPI Wednesday
by six seconds. His time for the

4.68 mile course was an excellent
23:59.8. According to Couch
Munsey, the entire team displayed
fine running and hung on to whip
tough RPI and strong Sicmi
squads.

The State University at Albany
football club will host Niagara
University in a 2 pm. Home-
coming Game Saturday, October
9. The Great Danes, 1-1, will be
seeking to rebound from a 41-21
loss at Rochester Tech. Niagara
was idle last week after opening
with losses to Hudson Valley and
Siena.

Albany conch Bob Ford, dis-
appointed in his team’s per-
formance tit RIT, is contemplating
several changes. Probably new
starters include defensive tackle
Nick Conte (New Hartford), who
has recovered from a pre-seuson
injury; linebacker Arnie Will, a
Troy High graduate; and offensive
tackle Kleon Andreadis (Brook-
lyn).

Running stair Bernie Bogga
(Ballston Lake), who suffered a
concussion the only time he car-
ried the ball at RI'I‘, will be ready
at tailback. Joining him in the
backfield will be quarterback Bill
Fltinugnn (Bethpzign), fullback
Lonnie Davis (Albany High), and
flanker Ernie Thomas (Ro-
chester), Bogg‘s sub, freshman
Cnrvin Payne (Philip Schuyler, Al-
bnny), has been coming along well
and should see considerable uc-
tion.

Danes was flcot split cnd Eddie

caught four passes for 153 yards
and three touchdowns, including
scoring bursts of 63 and 75 yards.
Despite the long TD bombs, how-
ever, the Albany passing attack

:ontinued to fizzle, as Flanagan
ind Rick Petty (New York) com-
pleted just seven of 28.

The statistics were closer than
the score, as Albany ran seven
more plays from scrimmage and
had just 58 fewer total yards. A
major factor was the kicking
game. The Dance failed to exacute
the punt three times and all three
led directly to RIT scores. A
fumble, a blocked kick, and the
punter’s knee touching the ground
coat Albany dearly.

The long play also hurt the
Danes, with RIT scoring on a
61-yard run the ﬁrst play from
scrimmage and later completing
TD passes of 60 and 44 yards. The
Tigers were successful on six of
nine passing attempts for 147
yards rind out-rushed the Danes
167-110.

Season statistical leaders for Al-
bany are receiver Williams with six
catches for 207 yards and three
touchdowns; Boggs and Davis, 92
yards rushing each; and Payne, an
average of 5.1 yards for 15 carries.

The passing has been woeful:
eleven completions in 39 attempts
for 28.2%.
