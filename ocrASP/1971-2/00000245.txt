The City of Albany, as all but the most innocent of freshmen
must know by now, has never been overly fond of its student
population. This is why I must say I was pleasantly surprised to
see that the Albany Symphony's ﬁrst regular concert of the year
is subtitled “A Salute to Students." The program, including
Brahms Academic Festival Overture (which uses the famous
student song “Gaudeamus lgater“ in its finale), the third
symphony of Robert Starer, of whom I blush to say l know less
than nothing, “Pithoprakta,” by Yannis Xenakis, a work com-
posed in 1954 that explores the possibilities of similating
electronic sounds with conventional instruments, and Mendels-
sohn‘s ever popular “Italian Symphony“ will be given next
Saturday at the Palace Theatre, that great monument of faded
artiﬁcial grandeur.

Do I hear the mocking voices of students from Buffalo,
Rochester and New York City? The Albany Symphony? Am I
joking?

No sir. The Albany Symphony may not, like the NY.
Philharmonic, make the front cover of Newsweek. but for a city
the size of Albany it is an ensemble to be reckoned with. The
Albany Symphony has come a long way in recent years, and has
handled such difficult works as Stravinsky‘s “Petrouclika” and
Hindemitli‘s “Concert Music for Strings, Brass and Percussion“
with expertise. Julius Hegyi is no Pierre Boulez, of course, but his
interpretations are often quite respectable. I‘m looking forward
with anticipation to the syniplioiiy's performance of liurtok‘s
“Concerto for Orchestra." I really believe the A80 is up to it. Fora
dollar fifty for a student ticket. next Saturday‘s performance is
quite a bargain.

SECOND ENDINGS: WMHT-FM is coming in April! Full time
classical music! Hosanna in Excelsis!

The NY. Philharmonic did make the cover of this week‘s
Newsweek. It's a good article on Boulez.

A good concert Oct. 13 at Troy Music Hall! Ives Ist Symphony
(not too bad, but tame for Ives) and Mozart's 27th Piano
Concerto with Rudolf Sevai.

'Ne'7'”"So-un-ds Close Saratoga Season

by Bill Brina

Miles Davis was forced to cancel
his scheduled appearance at the
Saratoga Performing Arts Center
Sunday night, due to the illness of
his pianist’s wife. That, plus the
cold and the rain of the evening,
cut the crowd down to a few
hundred. Those few hundred,
though, received a rare treat—2r
crisp, crackling performance by a
virtually unknown (in this coun-
try), English band—Wishbone

Ash. When the Saratoga MC
brought the band on, calling them
the No. 1 jazz-rock group in
England and winner of two trade-
paper polls, I was somewhat
dubious. in that respect 1 still
am—Wishbone Ash is basically
an electric rock-and-roll band that
uses jazz shadings and colorings,
not a jazz-rock band. They are,
though, one monster of an electric
rock band. The sound is remin-
iscent of early Quicksilver—twin
leads on guitars, bass and drums,

just a few of the hundreds of
superb images that the eye is
treated to during The Coli/urmisl.
Director Bernardo Bertolueci and
his cinematographer Vittorio
Storiiro, in their depiction of
Fascist Italy circa 1938, have
created an environment that is as
(ltimlingly authentic as it is terri-
fying.

Furthermore, the film offers just
as much intellectually as it does

and when the war ends and
Mussolini is deposed, he is once
again the outsider, thc misfit. The
film works on many, many levels
as an essentially corrupt society
takes its toll on what might have
been I] decent man.

The Con/ormist combines all its
clcrnansvpoctic as well as sharply
realistic—into a unified whole of
staggering power. The story—

conl‘usedly. But gradually we are
swcpt up into the tragedy of this
poor man, and swept up so com.
plctcly that. the last twenty min-

climax you are likely to see. It is

but the tightness and precision

with which the music is per-
formed was stunning. No stoppi-

ness, no mistakes at all. Guitarist

Ted Turner, who took lead for

most of the show, plays in a
manner reminiscent of the Jimmy

birds, but sooo precise. Drummer
Steve Upton is a monster—
ferocious, powerful, and driving
yet lean, spare, and again, precise.
Bassist Martin Turner provided
the visual excitement and played
Well at times but appeared to be
having trouble with his amplifier
for most of the evening.

Ted, Martin, and guitarist Andy
Powell iill took a crack at the
vocals, and all acquitted them-
selves extremely well. The sound
balance, by the bye, was ex-
cellent. The lyrics were clearly
projected—something very im-
portant for ii band whose material
(original) is largely unfamiliar.
During their monster-jam number,
the “Phoenix”, Ted ran out of
original ideas midway through,
and resorted to shifting octaves
and turning the volume (already
loud) up another notch, marring
an otherwise perfect set, For new-
comers, though, they were ex-
cellent.

The audience loved them and
hauled them back for three en-
cores. The final encore was ii
smasher ~ "Whiskey Lady."
Andy Powell led with a strong,
lyric, somehow Celtic set of riffs

that put anything Martin Biirrc of

Nick Brignolii had to follow that

politely, but he just couldn't

attempts at acting (facial ex-

by Edie Walker who reminded me

At Palace --

Being relatively unfamiliar with
“Superstar” (although we used
the music in our high school Sing
last year), I cannot successfully
compare the live show to the
album. However, there is always a
certain esthetic satisfaction in see-
ing a live show, and of course, the
sound level is so many decibels
higher.

The interpretation here seemed
to portray Jesus as a man disillu-
sioned with his life, yet ego-
tripping on his own popularity,
possibly at times almost scornful
of his followers. Does this corres-
pond with the Bible story? Is this
entire show “offensive” in some
way to the devoutly religious? I
am sure that Life or Newsweek
magazine must have at one time
called “Jesus Christ, Superstar"
something like “a reverant rock
opera" or “a new slant on an old
story." I'd have to agree. It is
inconceivable that Jesus Christ
ever held a microphone or anyone
ever said, “Hey J.C., you’re all
right by me," but that only en-
hances and updates the beauty of
the story, and the fantastic An‘
drew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice
music has a dynamic and powerful
hy notic effect, almost spell-

inding.

Seeing “Jesus Christ, Superstar"
is an experience requiring involve-
ment and an openness. Monday
night's Palace Theatre crowd came
and left with the good feelings
aroused in them by just such
awareness.
