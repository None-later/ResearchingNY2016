Happiness Is
A Nude Dorm

by Steve Dickinson
An ASP Column
In view of the response so far to
the 4 plus 2 experiment: I, it is
evident that more thinking and
planning along these same lines
would be valuable. To be part of a
warm community in the midst of
sterile architecture and cold
bureaucracy is something most, if
not all, students would strive
toward. However, just forming
more 4 plus 2's would merely
institutionalize one alternative,
admittedly a good one, but would
ignore all the other possible alter-

nativas. Not all community-
minded students think along the
same lines as 4 plus 2, and alterna-
tives should be formed to try and
meet the needs and desires of as
many students as possible. As
ideas for ulternativas come up
they should be examined by
LAAC, and, if at all feasible,
actively promoted.

"All right," you say. “What'S
this dude’s idea?” NudIIY~ N0
shit. If a sense of community is
desired, it group-warmth is de-
sired, if a sense of freedom is
desired, then a nude dorm might
be the answer for some. When
clothes are shed, so too are many
masks that we daily project and
guard jealously. There are few
pretentions possible in a nude
community - good clothes count
for nothing, and no onc's nudc
body is so much more ueg or
beautil'ul than anyonc clscs. At'tci'
a whilc, whcn the novelty of nudc
flesh surroundng you has passcd,
it is no longer noticcd. llut thc
sense of frccdom is still thci'c. 'I'lic
. , c of basic couality still prc-
vails. And it‘s just so much lillirt'
comfortable than dcaliiig with
constricting bras or lit‘lts.

Body modcsty is just anolhcr
cultiirally-imposcd convculion, lti-
timatcly tied up with thc bclicf
that. the body is evil, that it is thc
sourcc of all sin, aild thcrcforc

Meditation May Be
The Answer

by Andy Palley
An ASP Feature

There are many concepts and
beliefs which Modern American
Man will not buy. Some ideas are
rightly suspect— our 200 year—old
fear of government is constantly
proving useful and corrcct in light
of the growing number of both
leftist .ind rightist tlictatoi‘ships.
So, our disbelief in gchrnment is
good— but wealsodisbelicvc in Uto-
pia. Is this contratlictory'lNo, t'or
we all know that there is no such
thing as Utopia, a Greek word
ntaning "nowhere." We are hard-
ened by this belief and, although
we strive for greater happincss, we
know that we will never reach
pure happiness.

And here is Jerry Jarvis coming
up to SUNYA to tell us that he
knows the way amt that for $35
we can get therc in onc chk or
so. And not by a new system of
government (or lack of one), but
by a formerly inert mental proper-
ty contained within each of us.

As usual, I was skeptical, but
curious. As with all formulae for
Elysium, it demands chccking out
before the incriminations begin.
Ho\Vevcr, I had not gotten but
two feet in the door whcn l was

We hcar much discussion about
how it is everything from drugs,
the Revolution, the Movement to
rotti-n dorm food that binds stit-
dcnts together.

Not true. There is one thing that
binds all students all over the
country's all over the world—
togclhcr,

'I'heir parents.

There usually are two of them
pcr stutlcnt. Some students have
more, or less; but usually each
strident is blessed with two. And
it's not easy for us to forget them.

The first letter comes a (lay after
you'Vc arrived, taped to the out-
sidc of a large package.

“Di-ar Hon, Enclosed with this
lcllcr is a year‘s supply of vita-
mins so that you shouldn't gct a
dcl'icicncy." And thc lctters arc
always signcd Your Mother so you
shouldn‘t think it's somi-onc clsc's
inothcr who's sending you vita-
mins.

and I are very disappointed that
you're, that you're—”

“That I'm what, Ma?

"That you're smoking cigarettes
and drinking sherry. You prom-
ised you wouldn't, Marvin."

“But, Ma, I—"

“So listen, Star. You looked
very nice on the TV. Maybe you
should go into the television
field...”

"Ma."

"So who was that girl you were

wij‘h'fy'ou never told your mother
auoui. uer..."
And on and on it goes, your

Mother, having only your best
interesLs at heart. Of course.

And then there's that evening
you call home ‘-‘just to talk" and
your mother's out and you at-
tempt to talk to your father and
mention that you're changing
your major.

"Dad?"

"Yes, Son." (He calls you Son
so that you should ii't forget.)

“I'm changing my major t'rom
I’ieMed to Humanities."

"’I‘o Humanities?

"Yeah."

"What are you going to do—
opcn up a IIumanitiL-s store’.’

But worsc than the letters,
worsc than the phone calls, are
thc Vacations. ’I‘hcrc usually are
lhrcc or four a year. You come
back home cxhaustcd from cram-
ming hard after wcck-long exams,
tircd from having lcd such a
staunch, clean-cut, moral college
life, wiped out from those post-
finals parties. You return home
looking tired and worn out, ready
to go back to your old room and
faint.

As you walk in the door, your
mother pulls out an old copy of
the National Observer.

“See, Al," she says
father. "I was right."

Your father tucks in his under-
shirt and takes a deep breath.

"What's all this about? you ask
weakly.

"Marvin, your eyes are blood-
shot," your mother says.

"I haven't slept much—exams."
“And I detect a drastic change
in your pi-rsonality.”

“Moin~ I‘m exhausted."

“And you've lost weight." she
says, reading from the paper as
she nods and sighs. "And you‘re
wearing a long-sleeved shirt. I-
knew-it."

“Mom, It‘s ten below out."

“I knew it. Al. I knew it. I was
right all along. The boy," she says,
ignoring you, turning to your
father, “is On Drugs. Any minute,
the narcotics men will be here to

to your

take you away, to ruin all the
pleasure of our vacation with
you."
