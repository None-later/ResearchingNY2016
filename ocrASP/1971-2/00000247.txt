Carnegie Commission Report

 

What Does College Do to

by Don McLeod
Associated Press Writer

A college education isn't worth
as much in dollars as it once was,
a new report claims, but it defi-
nitely leads to the good life,

College graduates do make more
money, and their jobs are more
comfortable, says a study for the
Carnegie Commission on iligher
Education.

What's more, they are more like-
ly to be Republicans, although
their political philosophies are ilt"
cidedly liberal. They read more,

know more, vote more and take a

 

greater part in community activi-
ties.

“The college experience appears
more likely than not to make
students more open-minded and
liberal, less concerned with mater-
ial possessions, more concerned
with aesthetic and cultured values,
more relativistic and less moralA
istic, but more integrated, rational
and consistent," the report says.

“Students tend to lessen in their
adherence to traditional values
and traditional behaviors," the re-
port adds, “they become less au-
thoritarian although this may be

related to the social climate at the

time of their education. They

become more aware of themselves
and of interpersonal relationships
and show a greater readiness to
express their emotions,"

Dr. Clark Kerr, chairman of the
commission, said at a news confer-
ence Tuesday the study was
undertaken to answr-r questions
about whether college training is
generally worth the time, effort
and money required.

The study was conducted by the
institute for Social Research at
the University of Michigan. The
report, “A Degree and What Else?
'i'he Correlates and Consequences

of a College Education." will be

published by McGraw-llill later

this month.

in a foreword to the published
report, Kerr said people Who go to
college tend to be:

AMare salisfied with tlieirjobs -

More highly paid and less sub-
for! to unemployment.

“More likely to l'()l(' and to
participate generally in communi-
ty activities.

’l’l’lUl‘U “liberal” and tolerant in
their attitudes loiiiard, and rclal
tioiis with, other individuals.

More informed about t‘lllllttlll-
iiity, national, and world affairs.
The report concludes that as a

an?

pact and berm/ll."

it says also the impact is cumu-
lative overgenerationswith sons
and daughters of parents who
have gone to college taking on
more of the college inﬂuence than
their classmates whose parents did
not make it to college.

One of the more surprising find-
ings is that higher education as an
investment - in terms of how
mach it will increase a person's
earning power - is generally over-
rated. “A parent could do as well
with a stock investment," Kerr
said.

College Enrollment Will Double

by Lee Lindcr
Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Enroll-
ment in American colleges will
double by the year 2000, the
Carnegie Commission on Higher
Education has predicted.

'l‘his climb will need about £l0t)
new institutions, two thirds of
them two-year community col-
leges, mostly in metropolitan

areas.

“The United States is creating a
society in which more people will
have had more education than
ever before in history in any
nation," the commission reported.
“it is making higher education
available to all who want II for
whatcVi-r reason. "

in its report, “New Students and
New l’lnees," llH' commission esti-
mated thal by Ztilltl hall" of all
young people between lit and 2]

will he in college, compared with
35% now.

But because of uncertainties the
commission issued two growth
studies:

1. Based on past growth rates, it
predicts enrollment will hit 13.5
million by 1980 and climb to 17.4
million by the year 2000,

2, Noting changes in the labor
market for college degree holders
and a reduced birth rate, it says

enrollment may reach only 16
million by the turn of the century
with 12.5 million by 1980.

Dr. Clark Kerr, commission
chairman, explained to a news
conference the current enrollment
of 8.1 million would rise sharply
in the 19705, shrink it little in the
19803, and then increase heavily
again in the filial decade of the
20th century.

The commission described this
as a go~stop~go cycle, and ex-

pressed eoncern for the expected
slowdown or decline in the 1980s.

“That decade may present spe-
cial problems for educational
planners because during such per-
iods it is hard to obtain funds or
to arouse interest in change and
innovation," the report said. “if
this difficulty cannot be over-
come, institutions may be unpre
pared for the big enrollment. in-
creases that will characterize the
final decade of this century."
