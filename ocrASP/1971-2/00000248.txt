Every Wednesday at three in the afternoon forty-
six members of the SUNY community gather to
discuss social change, plan direct action in the
community and weigh the value of non-violence as a
revolutionary tool. They are participants in an A&S
300 course called “NONVIOLENCE WORKSHOP”.

The course is taught by Steve Stalonas, a thirty-
year-old Quaker from New York City, who has a
long list of "Movement" credentials. Stalonas is one
of the directors of the Quaker Project, a training
and organizing center sponsored by the Religious
Society of Friends. He is a national organizer for the
People’s Coalition for Peace and Justice, has been
afﬁliated with the Institute for the Study of
Nonviolence in Palo Alto, California and works
closely with the Harrisburg Defense Committee and
War Resisters League.

A graduate school drop-out, Stalonas is now a
Visiting Lecturer in the Philosophy Department. He
takes no money from the University. His stay here
in Albany is supported entirely by private contri-
butions. Since he lives in “voluntary poverty,"
Stalonas's budget while he is here is $500. The $500

As Act of ‘Recommitment’

not only supports Stalonas, it also pays the trans-
portation costs for the wide assortment of guest
speakers that he brings.to campus for his classes.
More money is being sought by a student-faculty
committee.

Since arriving on the campus, Stalonas has tried to
make a living witness of his personal credo “the
world is the way it is because we’re the way we
are.” He played an important role in setting up the
Attica rally at the capital and organized and
participated in two guerilla theatre actions on
campus and in downtown Albany.

Last Wednesday Stalonas began a seven day fast
which will end Moratorium night. The last three
days of the fast will be conducted as a round the
clock vigil at the Campus Center fountain. The fast,
according to Stalonas, is a personal act of re-
commitment ,..a way of reminding himself that
change only comes about when people act and that
action is limited only by self‘dISCiPlln0~ it is his
hope that students and faculty will join him for
and sharing of ideas while he is

maintaining his vigil.

approach Central Council next

Thursday for funds. They need
only a majority vote for an ap-
propriation. Money is needed to
seek financial assistance from off
campus sources and to pay for
paperwork for Registration.
Central Council rejected an up-
proprialion of funds to the Day
Care co-op in early September.
The Day Care Center group, repre-
sented by Peter Pollack, was no at
that time a Student Association
group. They therefore required a
two thirds majority vote to obtain

funds.

Pollack remarked at the October
7 meeting, "We have no formal
structure," Nevertheless com-
mittees, Finance, Food, By-Laws,
and Registration, exist.

The Parents co-op plans to meet
with parents interested in using
the Day Care Service on October
27, The purpose of the meeting is
to determine the structure of the
Day Care Center and to introduce
the Day Care staff to the parents.
By-laws regarding the purpose of
the Board of Directors and the
Committees still must be dis-
cusscd and ratified.

ratio of the numbcr of hours a

to the parent volunteer hours is
not l‘chd.

It was reported at the October 7
meeting, licensing from Social Ser-
vices of New York State is per-
missible without the incor-
poration of the Day Care Center.
The Center operates as tl co-op.
This facilitates an early opening of
the Day Care Service.
