Collective Pressure

Ever been to a big concert at our gym? it's an
especially interesting experience ifyou’ve stood at the
beginning of the line, near the doors. When those
doors are opened, say your prayers, because your
chances of survival are slim. Why? Do the other
people really want to flatten you against the wall?
Hardly. it's simply the collective will of many
individuals desiring to get inside that gym as soon as
possible. And it’s an excellent example of a terrible
phenomenon.

Remember Attica‘.’

Another great example. Take an entire state of
people. average citizens who individually would never
have the courage or the hatred to commit minder,
and create a situation such as the Attica l’CVOlI. These
same individuals, collectively, not only condoned the
counterattack/massacre, but had much to do with the
presumed “necessity” of such a move. ('olleciive
pressure can be looked at as a cause for the deaths.
What's sickening is that the chiefcorrectional ofticci.
along with the Governor of this state. would yield to
such pressure in such an c\plicit iiiaiinei. However,
we must riot divide the blame for ihose deatlisainong
all of us. We must act as individuals. accepting
individual and personal responsibility for the :ic‘l\ of
violence cumittcd in oiii name.

There is one last thing we can do. As I have stated
before, we must iioi allow those responsible to go
free. We must show elected (and otliei) officials
everywhere that acting lll response to public moods
does not absolve them of the consequences of their
actions. There must be no whitewash; we iiiilst insist
upon the truth.

Remember Attica.

Phys Ed Requirement

To the Editor:

I would like to take the opportunity to protest a
situation which has existed far too long: force fed
fizz-ed. The fact is that here at SUNYA, a forward
looking University, I am told, one year of “Physical
Education" courses is still required of everyone. I
write this letter lodin in the hope that this issue
may be aired publicly, and that my unpleasant
experiences may not be visited upon others.

1 registered for the introductory “Foundations of
Physical Education" course' in August. On October
ilth, i decided not to attend my fizz ed. class
because the prospect of running a mile nauseated
me, as had the previous classes It was at. that point
that I decided not to attend another l’hiz. Ed. Class
ever again knowing full well that the possibility
existed that I might not graduate in 15173, as a
consequence. l havu always had an aversion to fizz.
ad, I am generally turned off by militaristic tenden-
cies, conformity and rcgimcntation. and l have seen
those characteristics represented and encouraged. in
every Phiz. Ed. course I have taken including the
one offered here at. SUNYA. i managed to endure
the course for oneI month and l resented being told
to run at the sound of a whistle, jump on cue. and
perform figure eighls. I was somewhat surprised at.
the attitude of one coach in particular who did not
hide his distaste for the long hair worn by my friend

and 1.

When the “Cure” proposal was passed last year
one festering, fizzling sore remained untreated. Jusf
as i do not believe that the Marine Corps builds
men, [do not believe that one year of fizz. ed. will
make me a healthier, better person. I am quite
pleased with my decadence, thank you, if the folks
down at the gym would choose to call it that I
would never suggest that Phys. Ed is l.()l.’lll
worthless and should be abolished enlir ‘ y

I ’ . ely. i do
suggest that ll, is time to remove the one remaining
required course from the undergraduate SUNYA
curriculum. The Phys, ["4]. requirement should be
abolished it should be made voluntary for all. Now

 

Sincerely.

Niagara Falls, 35—20

by Alan D. Abbey and Phil Prince
Though the odds were not so
insurmountable, such as a team
with only thirty players, the Great
Danes plunged to a 35-20 victory
over Niagara University, Saturday
Homecoming Weekend.

Both teams showed good of-
fenses and poor defenses in a
frantic five touchdown first quar-
tcr. The first time Albany had the
ball they drove 32-yards in six
plays and scored on a 56 yard
touchdown drive. It was capped
with n one-yard plunge by Ron
Tubolsky.

Throughout the game Niagara's
running was inept, forcing them
to pass frequently. This enabled
the Dane secondary to lay back
and pick off four interceptions,
two of which were easily con-
verted into touchdowns. The first
interception was returned to the
Niagara ill-yard line by Jeff
O'Donnell and on the very next
play fullback Lonnie Davis

crashed off tackle for the second ground defense. From the be-

Albany score.

Once again the Purple Eagles
came up with a fast answering
touchdown. This time their
passing attack clicked as they
drove 80 yards in four plays. The
key play of the drive came when
halfback Ed chica hauled in a
43<yard pass from quarterback
John Scotto. chica was Niagn-a’s
lone standout as he played superb-
ly on both offense and defense.

Albany's third and final .scorei
of the first quarter came on a
terrific 50-yard reverse by split-
end Ed Williams. Williams broke a
tackle ton yards behind the line
of scrimmage and broke numerous
others on his way to the end zone.
Neither tcam scored again until
the fourth quarter, leaving the
score at 21-l 2 State.

At the half, .‘iiagzu'a bad racked
up 2l2 yards to Albany's 173.

ginning of the second half to the
end of the third quarter the only
thing either team could do was
punt.

With a minute left. in the third
quarter Boggs fumbled on his own
12 yard line and Maggi-agrnbbed
the loose ball and scored several
plays later, tightening up the score
to 21-20. The Albany defense
then stiffened up and denied Nia-
mentrance to the Purple and
gold crossbars. The Danes con-
cluded with two more scores to
wrap up the game in their favor.

The first came on a bizarre play
when an alert Ed Reinfurt picked
up a fumbled overhead lateral and
dashed in for the score. On the
Dties last drive they closed out.
the day’s scoring on a beautiful
broken field 60-yard run by
Boggs. The offensive line blew out
the Niagara defenders and Boggs
ﬁnished his greatest day ever by
converting his third PAT of the
day. He ended up with a total of
147 yards in 19 carried for a 7.7
yard average.

When the Danes defense jelled,
they almost looked like a team
that could have a winning season.
