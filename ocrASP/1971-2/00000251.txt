Once Again, Duty Calls

b Robert Mayer
.4in ASP Column

We have arrived at a point where
discussion and thought among
young people concerning student
protest evokes feelings of nostal-
gia, apathy, and in some instances,
resentment. The reasons for this
are often heard, “well it doesn’t
do anything," or "for years we
demonstrated and the war still
goes on." These sentiments are
real and I do not mean to ques-
tion their validity. However the
consequence of this thinking has
resulted in a very costly mistake.
Apathy is a luxury that only the
ignorant and heartless can afford.
If we as young people accept it
like our predecessors did, we can
by no means expect to build a
better world. The innocence that
one assumes becomes sinful and
instead of seeking an answer we
only serve to further injustice. We
marched, sang, petitioned, can-
vassed, talked, screamed, fought,
and some gave their lives for an
ideal that we were drawn to be-
cause something inside said we
must. For our humanistic and
unselfish sacrifices America gave
us King and Kennedy‘s funeral,

Chicago, Kent and Jackson State,
Washington stadium, San Quentin,
and Attica.

The answer is not silence, it is
not acceptance, it is action. Ac-
tion that goes far beyond inner
sentiment or revolutionary rhetor-
ic. To be silent would only mean
that those who perpetuate injus-
tice, and hold suffering dear, have
squashed all resistance and have
succeeded in furthering their
ways. That is precisely their goal,
to shut us up, to keep us preoc-
cupied and that is what we must
refuse to comply with. If we are
going to the universities to be
manufactured into some product,
if we live only for next week’s
exams, grad school, or week-end
parties, we have adopted the very
sickness that is destroying this
country. If this is what we are at
school for then we can not lie to
ourselves, we must admit that
being here is bullshit. On the
other hand, if we are here to learn
real truths, distinguish between
right and wrong, and then act
with the knowledge we hold, then
our preserve here is justified.

Tomorrow is not another mora-
torium against the war, it is, “the
'noratorium.” I do not mean to

Housing Operation Funded By Student Money

by Mike Ellis and J. Stephen Flavin

Neatly tucked away in the for-
estsjust off perimeter road behind
the Chapel House is Waverly
Place. Acquired in 1965 by FSA
as a platform house from which
new faculty could search for per-
manent housing, Waverly Place
was soon occupied by its present
inhabitants, Lois Gregg, Assist-
ant Vice Presdient of Student
Affairs, and Janet Havens of the
University Counceling Center.

Platform housing acquired by
the University through FSA was a
means to lure new faculty to this
campus at a time of rapid Univer-
sity growth and a well noted lack
of housing in and around Albany.
Mrs. Gregg was invited to join the
SUNYA administration but could
not find a suitable house.

in a letter of that year from
George Brewer, then director of
FSA, Mrs. Gregg was guaranteed
nccomodations upon her arrival
from California. Thc letter states
she may reside ill Waverly Place
until the Univorsity has need of
the house.

Dr. Clifton 'I‘hornc, former VlCt'
President of Student Affairs and a
member of the Board of Dirccioi's
of FSA saw in Mrs. (lregg's iob
the need to entertain students and
faculty in her residence. A house
close to the campus would l'acili
tritc more readin the ciitcrtniiiiiig.
Platform housing was sllpposcrl to
be run at cost and verbal lciiscs
not to extend for more than two
yCill‘S. The monthly rent. at Waver-
ly Place was $125, FSA assuming
taxes and fill ptilitics. A year ago
the rent was raised to $150 per
month. Dr. ’i‘horne justifies the
low rent as compensation for en-
tertaining in her residence. Willi
two people splitting the rent, each
pays $75 per month plus heat.
Mrs. Gregg furnished the housi-
herself.

Some members of the University
Community criticize the long stay
and low rcnt charged to Lois
Gregg rind Jan llrivens as a “mis-
use of the concept of platform

 

housing." Robert Cooley, Execu-
tive Director of F‘SA says he needs
another year to determine the filtt‘
of Waverly Place. llLI expressed
“cmbarassnicnt.” over the entire
housing operation, “There is no
lease at Waverly Place. Wc arc in
control.“ But in control of what‘.’

“i am I‘l‘tidy to move at any
timc.‘I (li'cgg asserts, “'l‘herc has
lll'\'t‘i‘ been any sccurity living
licrc, not knowing ii' i can livc
hi-rc lhc following year."

Waverly Place is ill! “arty house"
and Gregg and llavcns rirc “rirty
pcoplc." Lois dribblcs in oils and
adequately well; Jan is ill! accom-
plishcd pianist, SUNYA Security
was slated to mch into Wavr-rly
l’lacc this fall but found or were
given options on a larger building
on campus. 'l‘hc firm that, Security
displaces will move into another
FSA structure, regardless of the
law!

“1 lirch madc known to Student
Association the availability of
Waverly Place,“ Lois claimed,
"and faculty and staff are also
iIWill‘t‘ we are hcrc. l rim open to
suggestions on what can be done
to make more use of thI house."
Lois and Jan admit most of thier
iiitcrtiiining is of informal admini-
strative groups, but do entertain
RA's, summer planning confer-

  

ence groups, frats and sororities,
and other students on an informal
basis.

“The house could be turned
over to thc liiterniition Students
to use as ii center,“ Lois suggest-
cd, “but the design of the house
and lack of insulation limits its
uses.

Perhaps the easiest solution
would be to raise the rents on all
houses so FSA could break even if
its tenants are fitted to the houses
rind desire to “hang on.”

Foreign Students Favored By FSA

by Mike Ellis and .l. Stephen Firiviii

SUNYA‘s Faculty Student Asso-
ciiition does, contrary to popular
belief, miiintiiiii three buildings
for student rentals. ’i‘licsi- propcr-

Three properties are currently

These properties are owned and

from services rendered to stu-

sublet his apartment to other stu-
dents. He is, to my knowledge, the
only one to make a profit on an
FSA house in recent history. FSA
is now scheduled to remodel the
apartments at. 211 Ontario to ac-
commodate four families instead
of the present two families. Since
there was no lease, this onter~
prising internutionul's capitalistic
exploit was legal. There are no

students other than ii verbal agree.
ment. “The international student
office does not subsidize any
rents," Ward said.
