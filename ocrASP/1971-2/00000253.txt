Mr. and Mrs. John Lennon

by Steve Aminoff

The following is the transcript
of one of the best press con-
ferences I’ve ever heard or read
about. My preconceived notions
about what such a gathering
would be like were very strong as
I entered the gorgeous Egers'on
Museum in Syracuse. 1 wastaken
aback by not only the opulence
with which food and cocktails
were served, but the scene of the
reception before the actual con-
ference. It struck me to be some-
thing out of one of those radical
chic parties. complete with the
straight people throwing expres—
sions like “Right on" and "Out-
a-sight" around, as well as your
few token longhairs (yours truly
and my photographer, Marty
Amerikaner. very much included).

John and Yoko were in good
spirits as they entered the theatre
section of the museum. where the
meeting was to be held. I managed
to ask how they felt, and John
said, "Nervous, as usual, " They
sat down. talked to each other for
a while and John sang a little “ls
everybody happy? You betcha life
we are?" instead of the customary
"Testing l...2....'i...4..." Some
courtesy poses t'or the cameras,
and we're ready to begin:

YOKO: Hello. Thank you very

much for coming today, Most
people probably had to conic
down from New York all the way
to here and i'm very grateful for
that. Many people would
probably question why we'rc do-
ing an art show anyway in a
museum, you know, because the
art world is supposed to be dead
and especially the museum scene
is a dead scene. And, now, when
the whole world is in such crisis,
why should we be doing an art
show in a museum? People are
starving in the East and all that
and it seems like a silly thing to

do.

JOHN: Nonetheless, my dear.
YOKO: i thought of that, too. i
was wondering why I'm still an
artist, why i still consider myself
an artist when my friends are
taking guns and ready to fight the
establishment and trying to
change the world as violent revo-
lutionaries.... And their 1 really
found myself thinking that l real-
ly don't go for destruction, id
like to change the world too. but i
don’t want to take a gun to do it
And many of us. especially our
generation, people are very im‘
patient. Peace is not gonna come
unless all the violent feeling in the
world are completely gone and
that sounds like an idealistic. op:
timliitlc idea, but it can be done.
Peace is not a formal substance.
You can't just have peace on ii
surface. You have to dispense
with all violent feelings. The first
time a child learns about a feeling
is when he starts saying, "Mom-
my, mommy." iind mommy
doesn't answer him. Then he

 

 

starts to hit mommy. That's the
first violence that he learns and
that‘s because he can’t communi-
cate with his mommy and the
same thing with everybody. All of
us has a desperate need for
communication. And i think this
world now has two classes. One is
the class that can communicate.
The other is the class that can’t
communicate for one reason or
another. They think the people
who am communicate are people
who are privileged. They're
talented iind they're different. in
this show here, I'd like to prch
the fact that you don't need
talent to be an artist. Artist isjust
a frame of mind. Anybody can be
an artist and anybody can
communicate if they're desperati-
enough. There's no such thing as
imagination of artists. Imagination
would come out of necessity.
EVcn the best artsit, if they don‘t
haVc the desperation, they would
bc dried up and tin-y won't havc
any imagination. So, there is no
talent, no professionalism, there's
no nothing. All you havc to do is
to be yourself.

This museum a show

talented artist who is just (lcspcr-
ate I hope

JOHN: My slatcnu-nt is, ‘1

“WW- "l‘hank you.

i‘ltE t: Yoko, is it possilili- to
have a world without anxicly.
without fear, without hatred
through communicalion'.’

YOKO: Yes, definitely. But you
see, the communication media is
getting more and more developed,
but not yet. People are thinking,
“Well. they don't have the con~
trol." so they'll give it up. but we
have to find many ways of
coinmunicatioiis. Just. doii'l rely
on TV and radio only. There are
many other ways, we can do it.

PRESS: Would you say that
anyone can be iin artist.

YOKO: Yes, definitely. Every~
body is an artist, you know.

PRESS: if I threw an apple or
an egg to the wall, can anybody
call that art'.’

YOKO: Yes. if that q would
communicate with somebody, if
that would move somebody, as
that would encourage somebody
else to do something elite. Any-
thing is art if you can influence
people by it. you know, and if
you can communicate yourself
with it. You.

PRESS: Where would you place
the audience in all this?

YOKO: We‘re all audience and
we're all artists you know. ldon't
believe in just showing a lump of
some stone or something and that
this is art work, applauding some
sort of narci. ism of the artist, I
believe in communicating in a
sense of allowing other people to
have experience.

PRESS: Why have you choscn
the EVerson museum as your place
of communicating?

YOKO: I'm just very over-
whelmed by the museum itself
and i think Jim Harris was very
courageous in taking a chance on
me.

ol' image he puts out is sort of
black, inverted political reasons
but it's also for a laugh too, you
know, i mean but he's a serious
artist. too, l mean, he was beauti-

the rest of it.

YOKO: l iichr thought of
Japanese women as such so l

kind of Japanesque image that the
Westerns would have, probably,
but i never thought of it from
that angle. i think that American
women are pretty subservient...

JOHN: The Japanese in the past

had a completely female domi-
nated society. i don't know what
happened to it, but it was pretty
good when they had it.

YOKO: It's still dominated by
women in a way.,.if i could ex-
press something l'Ve seen in you.

PRESS: Yoko. John, may i ch
press something? Do you believe
that iii-sexuality is the
state, and that people just repress
their feelings“! (Laughter),

JOHN: You've been seeing

PRESS: Were you angry or were
you sad when you wrote ‘How Do
You Sleep'?‘

JOHN. Both. "How Do You
Sleep" startctl off in a more ab-
stract form a year and a lialf ago
and then it just sort of formed
itself through anger and sadness.
It's sort of like an outburst...and
my outburst in song. not any other
media at the moment. unless
you‘re into throwing eggs around.

YOKO: It's all good. We try to

PRESS: Too commercial?

JOHN: Commercial isn't neces-

his theory and his therapy and it
worked well enough to have me

JOHN: I get the most satisfac-

PRESS: How would you teach a
child to communicate?

YOKO: You don't have to teach
children—they know.

JOHN: Children don’t learn
communication; they unlearn it,
gradually through the system. My
own child looked at some of the
art in our home and understood it
on his own child-like level.

PRESS: John, what was the thing
that caused you to become radica-
lizcd'.’

JOHN:

come radical

it's when did 1 not be-

hayday, it was hard to keep any
sense of reality about you. It was

 

my own sort of maze of madness.
(lood and bad and that‘s when I
lost contact with pcoplc. And
then through Yoko and things
that Wcrc happening to me any-

JOHN: Sometimes l get angry
about nasty articles, sometimes i
get sad, and sometimes l have a

Davis Condoms Viet War
At SUNYA Moratorium

by Robert Mayer

Sonic four hundred Albany Statc studcnls galli-
crcd Wednesday to hear Rcimic Davis, a member of
the Chicago Seven. and others speak out against the
war in South East Asia. This rally was part of a
mlllUHWltl" moratorium sponsored by the People's
Coalition for Peace and Justice.

Davis, now working with the l’copIi-‘s (‘oalition
for Peace and Justicc. was joined at llli' podium by
Tim Butz from the Vietnam Vctcran‘s Against the
War, and Suc Gregory from PCPJ. 'l‘lic purposc of
the moratorium was to “stop busincss as usual" and
conduct various u(‘li\'lllt's and workshops that rcla-
ted to anti-war activities this fall.

'l‘im Butz, spcaking first, claimcd that Nixon, who
he referred to as “the madman who brought us
Victimmimtion," was telling the American people
that the Reds were the thrcat to our government,
while in actuality the lhrcat. to America was Nixon's

crimes of starvation, repression, and interference in
the affairs of other governments. Spcaking with tlic
knowledge of a former Veteran, Blitz ('llt'tl Vietnam

through a transition stage and something new was
developing. in response to past years national
mobilizations he said. “,..rcpcatcd over and over
again they are inadequate if not actually si-ll'-dcfcat~

come to be associated with the Left and considcrcd
the old line of rhctoric, style, and organization
obsolete. He pointed out that Americans think the
war is tin‘l' bccausc l'chr whiti- American (l.l.'s are

Tim Butz. a representative from Vietnam Veteran's Against the War, addressed the
protestors. He criticized the use of Vietnam as a “testing ground" for weapons.

arc l'orccd to live in the cities so the government. can
police thcin. Saigon, a city designed to hold 60.000
now has l'our million citizens with som1397,000 men
to policc the inhabitants. He added that under the
present policy of the Nixon administration “more
civilians arc under attack than at any other time in
the past 25 years."

Davis outlined some ol' the activities that were
planned l'or this fall's uffcnsivc, which he considered
only part of a largcr “election year offensive."
'l‘hcse plans include major demonstrations in several
localities as well as Washington D.C., a People's
Grand Jury, to invcsligatc the war, candle light
processions around the White House, civil disobe-
dicncc, and a l’coplc's Armistice Day. On that day,
Americans wishing to (list sociatc themselves with
US, foreign policy and make peace with the people
of Vietnam can do so by signing the seven point
pcacc plan proposed by the North Vietnamese
calling for a sct date of withdrawal of all American
troops. Davis called for a time to think of the Fall
()ffcnsiccas a new beginning, a new commitment, a
time for us to, "develop the humility to serve the
people of lllt‘ country." He concluded his tiilk by
saying. ”.,Wi- promise to bury the politics and
l'uturc of Richard Millions Nixon.“

At this point many students left the rally returns
ing to class or other destinations, Sue Gregory went
on to spcak of women understanding their role to
change Amcrican policy. She noted that our govern-
inciil. through Richard Nixon. was laying the
foundations for fascism. At the end of her speech
main students went inside the campus center to
attcnd workshops that specifically dealt with this
fall's initiatives to end the war in Vietnam.
