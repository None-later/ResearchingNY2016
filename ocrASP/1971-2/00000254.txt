ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Action For Fall Offensive
Outlined By Rennie Davis

by Sharon Cohen

The Fall Offensive of the peace
movement. was outlined by Ren-
nie Davis in one workshop on
Moratorium Day. The plans and
activities Davis described were to
“launch the whole election year
strategy" and were said to be part
of a slow, yet “continuous, on-
going process, building towards
public pressure to end the war."

Basically, the Fall Offensive in
Wahington is planned as “legal,
peaceful, and orderly manifesta-
tions of opposition to the war."
These consist mainly of meetings,
workshops, demonstrations. and
memorial services.

On Monday, October 25, a Pen-
pic's Grand Jury will publicly hear
testimonies from experts and "vic-
tims" on Indochina, the economy,
Pakistan, prison conditions, pollu-
tion, and other issues. This action
is intended to lead to a continued
investigation to assemble the facts
in these areas and later to state-
wide teach-ins throughout the na-
tion.

Also on Veterans’ Day, there
will be a rally at theI Sylvan
Theater. Among the speakers will
be representatives from the Peo~
ple's Jury and some Vietnamese
representaves, possibly including
Madame Binh. Monday night, a
candlelight procession around the

displiiy the same day on the el-
lipse in back of the White House.
The major theme of the exhibit
will be “Life in America Under
Richard Nixon," and it. will be a
“cultural expression" of Attica,
San Quentin, Vietnam, Laos, iirid
others, with drawings, poems and
other art forms. There will also be
a showing of the videotape of the
Grand Jury proceedings.

On October 26 there will be
marches from area universities and
churches to the White House. The
marchers will assemble on Penn-
sylvania Avenue where a memorial
Ceremony for those who died in
Attica and Vietnam will be held.
After the ceremony, a delegation
will serve an eviction notice to
Nixon. If a permit is not granted
for the ceremony and for entrance

into the White House, there will
be a mass display of civil dis-
obedience—a sit-in around the
White House.

On November 6, in 1520 cities
around the country including New
York and Boston, regional mass
rallies will be held to protest the
war, demand freedom for political
prisoners, and a guaranteed mini-
mum income. The rest of the
winter will be devoted mainly to
organization and ediication.

A discussion followed on the
offensive, organization, access to
information. A sign-up sheet for
dorm organization on this campus
was pasle around, and further
workshops were planned to mobi

sivc.

Pans—Communist delegates to the Vietnam peace talks charged
today that President Nixon's latest statements on the war prove
he intends to prolong the conflict indefinitely. The North
Vietnamese delegate, Nguyen Min Vy, told the l32nd session of
the peace talks: “Once again, it is evident that Mr. Nixon’s fine
talks of peace are empty talks. In sticking to its policy of
Vietnamization and striving to maintain the bellicose Thieu
administration, the US. will not be able to get out of this
inextricablc vicious circle.

Parking Appeals Committee
To Study New Solutions

by Andrea Carson

The University Parking Appeals
Committee grants special parking
permits, reviews appeals for viola.
tions of parking and is presently
studying the parking situation.
The committee, chaired by Dr.
Robert Nurnberger, was formed
by the University Council at
SUNYA in May 1969 in response
to problems and a general feeling
of injustice people were having in

 

 

regard to parking on campus.

The nlne member committee
meets to hear appeals, either in
written form or by personal
appearance. Applications for these
appeals can be obtained from the
Security Office, the Student
Association in the Campus Center
and the Information Desk in the
Administration Building. The
appeals should be sent to Dr.
Nurnberger‘s ofﬁce AD 236. If

ASP l’h oto/Po tsk owski

  
       

the person wishes to make a per-
sonal appeal, he should sign his
name at the bottom of the appeal
and then will be notified when to
appear for the hearing. The ticket
must accompany the appeal.
According to Dr. Nurnberger,
the most common and widely
denied appeals are (1) unloading
books or equipment in a no park-
ing zone (2) poor division of lots
(3) bringing unregistered cars on
campus (4) the misunderstanding
that parking regulations are not
suspended on holidays or week-
ends and (6) temporary parking.
The committee is examining the
parking situation and trying to
find some new solutions. Their
recommendations include: putting
physical barriers in no parking
areas, changing the parking space
allotment in order to get students
closer to their residences and
faculty closer to their work. and
assigning specific spaces and lots
to each registered car on campus.

Sheehan described the “Penta-
gon Papers" in his introductory
remarks as “2.5 million words of
narrative history and appended
documents written by 36 his-
torians appointed by Defense
Secretary Robert McNamara in
1967, Sheehan said that “the
study was commissioned at a time
when McNamara was disillusioned
with the Vietnam Wan... The 36
historians wrote a report for in-
side power managers that was
neVer meant to be published but
to remain within the Executive
Branch."

The 36-year-old correspondent
contended that the study "shows
our own government in violation
of treaty liiw such as the Geneva
convention.“

In the course of the war, accord-
ing to Sheehan, there are “more
than 15,000 American dead, per-
haps 2,000,000 Vietnamese, and
95,000 French without a declara-
tion of war and without great

The “Pentagon Papers teach us
that the leaders of this nation are
the leaders of an old iind cynical
country that has used the Victim-
mese, Laotians and Cambodians.

Calling for legal restraints and
limitations of the President's war-
making pwers, Sheehan said that
“if we don't restore the balance"
between our branches of govern-
ment, "we will be in danger of
losing our liberties. The first signs
of authoritarianism are already
showing," he warned, “a Euro-
pean authoritarianism where the
State knows best."
