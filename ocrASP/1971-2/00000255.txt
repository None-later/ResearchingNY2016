Endorsement By Default

Most people haven't yet decided who lo vote for in I972.
Despite the clamor and the speeches. no one candidate has
emerged as the mun with the best chance.

On one side - the Republican side 7 we will undoubtedly have
Richard Nixon running for another four years. He will remain;
his Vice-President is still up in the air.

We won't talk about George Wallace.

This leaves the Democrats: all six of them (so fur.) Humphrey.
Muskie. McGovern. llurris, Jackson and Lindsay. Mulching
Humphrey :igztinst Nixon (again) would be u mistake. since no
matter whirl Ilubcrl says people will remember the wax
l'lumphrcy. Muskie suffers from the I‘lhils us well. bul has
weathered it better and now does hesl of all Democrats in the
polls. He hurl himself recently with his rcmurk about lhe
chnnces Ufa blzick VI’ nominee. Ilis supporters have pointed bill
that “at least he was hunt-st." lle ccrluinly \vusn‘l diplomatic.
()nc feels than Ihc Muinc‘ senator will shortly run out of slcznn
unless he spcuks up.

"Scoop" Juckson, :i Demucrzn of the right wing has his
troubles. since lhe Dcnincruls don‘t need :r moderate conserva-
tive: Nixon thcnreliczilly fills [but need. John Lindsay may have
saved himself by switching parties. but he lost all liberal
Democratic support when he became in competitor instead nfun
ully. The Democratic party is wary of quick switchers; he bus u
better chance than in his old putty, but W72 will come too
soon for Mayor Lindsay.

This lCthL‘S McGovern lllld Harris, both midwestcrners, bulb
“grassroots” campaigners I‘Iurris, however. is for) grassroots:
slippin‘l for lhe senator, who admits to being un-reelcctublc In
his current post, is hugely lncul and rather spursc in that. Like
Lindsay. he is Inn sunn,tlnnlgl1 in Fred Hurris' case. it‘s now or
never. This leaves George McGovern. who is lungcsl in the “ICC
and least in the news, Ills stund has long been nnliwur. und he
believes Ihul the economic issue is directly tied In llic Wur issue.
I have yet In hour that from the Big Lulmr candidates and
Richard Nixon.

And so as things slund nuw, George McGovern would scent
the best but. Not the surest, though; one wonders if he'll
survrvc the primaries. especially since he lacks big money
bucking. lie is. however, one of the few politicruns worthy of
nut trust and llltllt‘ Iniptnlzuitly. our hopes.

More on
the Guide

To the Editor:

You have already, no doubt,
been deluged with muteriul from.
other campus newspapers conf
ccrning Mr. David A. Cavnnuugh
and the Strident Buyer's Guide.-
Thc purpose of this letter, there‘-
forc, is not to reiterate the fuels,
with which I um certain you are
ulroudy familiar, but rather to
inform you of whut actions Sierra
College and The INDIAN zl’ilse
taking agtrinst Mr. Covunnugh and
the publication. _

This post Wednesday, our Stu-
dent Senate passed it resolution to
bnn llit' Buyer's Guide from the
Slt‘nll campus. Mr. Cuvnnnugh will
be informed by mull of this
ilClll)". A lt‘lLCI‘ will :ilst) be soul In
Mr. (fiivnmnigh by our vice presi-
(ll'lll for student affairs, informing
him (but he nnd his publication
urr- unwelcome on this campus.

The INDIAN is also considering
li-gul action ugninst Mr. quvumrugh
for two reasons:

lll)l‘l'll(.'ll of contract. Lost
your, The INDIAN signed :1 one
your cuntrnvl with Assnciutud
Cullugc Merlin, of which Mr.
(.‘nvnnuugh wus (and still is, lo-
gully) president. Our t-untrucl does
not expire until Nuvt'mbur l of
this your.

During the summer, for
reasons known only In Mr.
(invnnuugh, he decided thnl ACM
wns no longer profitable (and

 

    

communications

clnims flint he was in debt) and
decided to terminate his business.
However, flC’ neucr legally went
out of business Hr- ncuer filed a
prlilioir of bankruptcy. Thero-
furc, from a legal standpoint,
Cuvunnugh, who is still supposed
to be acting as our “exclusive
agent" is not only breaching the
ACM contract; he is also in direct
competition (illegally), through
the Student Buyer's Guide, with
every college paper that signed the
ACM contract.

2) Mr. Ctivnnuugh sent. ll letter
to all of our advertisers during the
summer (u copy of this letter
should have been sent to you by
the RP] Polytechnic) in which he
actually discourages businesses
from advertising in our papers iind
encourages them to advertise in
the Buyer's Guide. This letter not
only contributes evidence to
Cuvuninigh's blutnnl breach of
cuntruct, but may be construed,
wr- fut-l, in; damaging to the
character of ouch of our pupers.
This may provide ndditionul
grounds for u lawsuit against Mr.
(Tnvnnnugh.

I would vncouruge ouch of you
to consider similar actions against
Mr. Cnvnnnugh. Ile bus demoti-
strated that he is interested only
in making it profit ill. our expense
and The INDIAN, for one, will
not. permit him to continue.

If enough unmpus newspapers lll‘u
interested in initiuting legnl tlL‘Lllm
against Mr. Cnvnnnugh, it may I)(‘
possible for us to trike him to
court its a gruup~ii kind of “Cities

Friends:

Being touched by frustration.
suffering, and anger stemming
from the fact that. all people do
not have the freedoms of life, we
feel it responsibility and u commit-
ment to our moral conscience to
persuade our government. (who
are individuals empowered by us),
to chnngo policies and actions so
that they are beneficial to our
brothers and sisters in this coun-
try nnd around the world.

Though we are not acting in
ticcmdunce with the law, we feel
that by pnying the ten percent
excise lux on the telephone bill
(passed in the Tax Reform Act. of

1966 solely for the purpose of

supporting our involvement in
Vietnam) we ure contributing to
the murder and destruction in
Judo-Chino, which has taken
priority over the basic nnd urgent.
needs of our people. We have
usurped our neighbors right to
live.

If you feel you can join us, Cull!
