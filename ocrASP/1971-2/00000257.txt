RAINBOW BRIDGE: Jimi Hen-
drix (Reprise MS 204 0)
Although this album is for the

most part a postmortem exploita‘,

tion job featuring leftovers and
scrap book'hits and pieces from
various places and times in the
past, there are some diamonds in
the dust that should inspire Hen-
drix freaks to add this to their
collection. .

Jimi never had a good voice and
he wasn‘t the world's greatest
composer either so he placed most
of his emphasis on absurd, charm-

ingly ob ure scl-fi lyrics coated
over with studio techniques. No
help needed with the guitar. how-
ever, for he was simply the ﬂash-
iest, most futuristic, faaah out
guitarist to populate the multi‘gal-
actic universe.

His early concerts were domina-
ted by such wild antics and gim-
micks as teeth plucking, pyroman-
is, and a passion to ball his guitar.

Despite the fact that his
career was an unmitigated success.
Hendrix eventually became fed up
with being a stage clown and
decided to concentrate on what
many critics thought was his
forte, the blues. The breakup of
the old EXPERIENCE band was a
hard blow though for (alas)Bud-
dy, Miles and Billy Cox were
nowhere near as talented as
Messrs. Redding and Mitchell. A
jazz drummer, Mitchell not only
could set strong beats but could
ﬂy all over his drum set as well.
Miles is a soul drummer and on
BAND OI“ GYPSIES, the album
recorded New Year's Eve at
(where else?) the Fillmore, his
repetitious, obvious rat-a-tat-tat
drumming restricts Hendrix’s
style.

“Hear My Train A Comin’ "'was
recorded live at a time when
Hendrix was playing with Cox and
Mitchell. Basically!!! rehash of his
previous blues cuts, and sounding

Posthumously Jimi

in particulrir like the Winwood,|

Cassady-Hendrix extravaganza
'Voodoo Child," there is still
some good playing to reckon
with. What gets me though is
Cox’s; bass playing which is slow,
plodding and lackadasical, as slow
and stagnant as Redding's was
consistent and alive. With a skele-
ton-like trio, each instrument
takes on an added importance;
this is true even with Hendrix who
sometimes sounds like he is play-
ing three or four guitars at once.

At any rate, Cox is in fine form
on “Dolly Dagger," a song that
exemplifies everything that made
Hendrix so great: strong rhythm
work, a precise guitar solo, bizarro
lyrics ("Been riding broomstieks
since she was 15, blown out all
the other witches on the scene/
She got a bullwhip just as long as
your life, her tongue can even
scratch the soul out of the devil's
wife,") and a rockin‘ drive from
start to finish. “Earth Blues"
shows off Jimi’s expertise with
the stereo system as his guitar
goes shooting back and forth from
speaker to speaker.

In general, there is enough good
guitar work to satisfy most. But
face it, most of the cuts wouldn't
be included on an album or in a
movie if not for the Hendrix
death and legend. "Hey Baby" is a
poorly produced, incomplete
track in which Hendrix just seems
to be fooling around with his axe.
The studio version of F.S. Key’s
“Star Spangled Banner” doesn‘t
come close to the Woodstock ver-
sion where more power was set
off with one guitar than the three
or four here. "Pon Gap" is sort of
a nice, on the spot recording, but
l'm pretty sure that Hendrix
didn't intend to have it released.
There is an old tradition that it is
not right to say bad things about
the deceased but I guess the
record companies feel it is quite
alright. to make money off of
them.

No longer is the Experimental
Theater a welcome alternative to
Friday nights; this season it is a
pleasing substitute for Friday af-
ternoons and Saturday nigh ts.

The season opened with a cute,
well carried on vaudeville, Oh Say
Can You See I..A..?, followed by a
more complex, well executed ex-
ercise, War a surreal dream of a
play. Oh Say Can You See begins
with the stage show number
"We’re Happy." performed by a
family troupe consisting of Pop,
played by William Doscher, his
creepy, hunched up brother Uncle
Charlie, a “biological blind ullcy.’I
(but what’s normal anyway?) per
formed by Arnold Colin, and
Pop‘s two sons, Sonny, a dreamer,
Philip Bennis; and Harold, a char-
ming nincompoop, Robert Chan-
in. Chastc Sonny, thirty years old
and living in the YMCA, wants to
quit the act and his family and
abscond to L.A. with the as yet
unborn child of a pregnant girl
whom he did not impregnate.
Unbrillinnt, patronizing Harold
and feeble, crabby Uncle Charlie
chastise Sonny for such dirty talk,
but shrewd, strcly Pop knows that
Sonny docs not really believe in

the ideals he spouts, as he has
never followed them through with
actions. Pop offers the secret of
life: “Inspire with thoughts and
words-never deeds.” You see,
Pop and his Wholesome family are
in the entertainment business, the
“human nature business." They
perform such touching numbers as
"Family Album.”preaching Scr-
enity: love, honor, hope, charity.
and all that. They sing “God Bless
Our Boys." they ask “What makes
a life worthwhile?," and the an-
swer, of course, is "Love."

After failing at ideologically
converting Sonny to the business,
Pop, with the help of Harold and
Uncle Charlie, violently beats Son-
ny into submitting to the belief
that he wants it nib-expediency
and money. Ending with a reprise
of “We're HuPPY." nubody is.
And as it requires an effort by Pop
to keep his business (family) to-
gether, so it requires effort on the
part of director Robert Verini to
move his players together. ()h Say
Can You Soc I.,A.? lacks a unity
and flow which War achieves quite
gracefully

Directed by William Doschcr,
Pop of the first play, War is a
delicate, polished battle between
old and young against each other
and time. Sharing only the meme
ory of a fragile, creamy woman,
mother, lover, divinity, elegantly
played by Mnryvonnc Plihon, the
Elder Actor and the Younger Act-

Herman and Victor Saffrin respec-
tively, steadily drift and shift
roles, confronting obsolescence,
present obstacles, and remembran-
ces from their past lives. The
ascent to the elder actor’s apart-
ment tires the younger actor. His
self-righteous, youthful arrogance
and gift of innocence, a kitten,
threaten the stability that the
elder actor has achieved and main-
tains in his remote abode. The
play is a collection of recol-
lections. The war between the two
actors degenerates from an
intellectual combat of criticism to
name-calling to a childish fist
fight. War does not end, though
the lights fade; the actors remain

in conflict, with the gentle guiding '

force of the woman to balance

them.

Carly And Livingston Get Off In Gym

by Mark Furman

Friday night, the University pre-
sented two of the best examples
of contemporary folk in America
today. Carly Simon is a clear
eyed, powerful singing Manhattan-
ite who sings simple acoustic
stuffLivingston Taylor plays any-
thing l'rom old rock and roll to
Coca-Cola commercials, with
much self-assurance and slugc pl‘c-
sencc.

Carly Simon came out first. She
sits on a stool wilh her acoustic
guitar, and begins to play “One
More Time", a song from her first
album, She has a backup band
consisting of a pianist. bassist and
drummer. llur music is primarily
acoustic, with Hllllli' occasional
background from an t-liwlric gui-
lni. Personally, I l‘i-i-l she would
do much better living i-nlircly

After the excitement of the
crowning of lIll' Homecoming
Queen (lll‘tl down, Livingston 'l'ay-
lor came on stage. Well, what can

all right! Liv walks onslugt- smil-

and is lhin and lanky. The minute

his own slyh» of performing. When
lll' first became popular 1:")
months ago, lll' was mort- or less

known as “James Taylor's Bro-
ther." Yet, Liv seems to have
managed to break away from this
association, by developing his own
style. While James sings the blues,
it's that rockin’ pneumonia that
seems to have influenced Living-
ston.

He was accompanied by friend
Walter Robinson playing bass.
(Standup bass, mind you; not an
electric one). Liv opened up with
a couple of songs from his first
album: “Hush A Bye” and “In My
Reply." He took the audience out
of this folkie mood when he
broke into Chuck Berry's “Mon-
key Business.” From here he went
into a cheerful little tune, “Sit on
Back." After paying a small hom-
age to the Beatles, Liv sang “lfl
Needed Someone," in a very slow,
sweet voice. He did some more
numbers from his album. Then,
believe it or not, he did “Some-
where over the Rainbow." 1 think
I prefer Judy Garland’s version,
but it was nice to see that some
songs do last over the year. Liv
has a new album coming out this
month, so there was also plenty of
stuff from that. There were two
mort- surprises in his set; McCart-
Iu-y's “With a Little Help from My
Friends," done with theI “Taylor
touch," and something also his
brother performs: a Coca Cola
commercial, which was a change
of pace, if nothing else. At the
end of the hour, Livingston went
over to the piano where he played
“lie That Way,” :1 song he wrote
for his sister Kate‘s album.

All in all, he was quite enjoy-
able, and it is nice to see him
finally making it on his own repu-
tation. He deserves it.

of "Joe," seems more at ease with
a satire than social commentary.
The film is marvelously paced and
wonderfully free-wheeling. Avild-
sen's control of the comic situa-
tions and his ability to interweave
and hold together a running gag
are given full and noteworthy
exposition.

Avildsen has assembled a fine
cast of comic actors, including
Allen Garfield as the detective,
whose main appeal involves an
urge to clean up his apartment
(done in early Brownsville) and to
press his perenially rumpled suits.
He's such a loveablc selemeil
