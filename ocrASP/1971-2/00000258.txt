Done Gridders oi Adelphi Tomorrow

The State University at Albany
football club will play its second
game against a varsity team
tomorrow, when it travels to Car-
den City, L.l., to meet Adelphi
University.

The Great Danes are 2-1 after
defeating the Niagara University
club 35-20.

New in its second year of inter-

collegiate fontball, Albany has ycl

to win a game on the road or
against a varsity team. The odds
against breaking those jinch this
week are long, despite Adelphi's
0-3 mark. The Panthers were
crushed by a strong Central
Connecticut team 51-0 then lusl
just 6-2 to Kings Point and ill-l2

beat the Uticn club 35-6 and lost
to RIT's varsity 41-21. Adelphi is
dropping intercollegiate football
after this season.

In its quest for an upset, Albany
will be coming off Wilill coach

fensive performance in two years."
