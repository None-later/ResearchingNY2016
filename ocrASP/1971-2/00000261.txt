Bonds: Benefit or Boondoggle

There has been a lot of shouting. writing. threatening, and confusion over the
Transportation liond issue which cotnes before tlte electorate this November. /\t
stake are some $2.5 billion in bonds (hence debt) for the purpose of building and
equipping highways. bridges, and mass transit facilities throughout New York.

The governor has beeti accttsed of using all the pressure he can mtister (arid that‘s a

considerable

amount) to get the tneasure passed. Opposing forces point to the
alreadypoor fiscal condition of the state. and to the

amount already spent on

highway construction. as well as the tactics being ttsed to get it passed. 'l‘hrougliout
this debate the actual facts of the matter have been confused. i

The bill authorizes the legislature to spend: (a) sortie $51,150,000 on highways .Illtl
bridges: (b) another Sl.150.000 oti mass transit facilities through all levels of
government and through public corporations; atid (c) the remaining 33.00.000.000
on mass transit links between upstate communities and New York City.

In a year of recession. it is questionable whether the state should spend so much
money. especially when we already seem to have paved—over most of New York
State. There is. however. the pressing need for more tnass transit facilities. especialh
outside ol New York (Iity. Thus the decision comes to a toss-up: Should New York
avoid getting into ttiore debt and more asphalt. or should we accept what remains a
compromise in order to decently begin work oti tnass transit systems?

With misgivings about Rockefeller‘s “Sell The Bonds" campaign. we think that
the Voters of this state should approve the bond issue. solely because of the latlx oi
luntls lor ititiss transit. it is. though, such a deep question that we urge you to make
your own inlot'tuetl decision. i I

SUNYARTS

by Steve Hirsch

It's a good feeling to realize you
don't haVe to spray paint “con-
cert” all over campus to get peo-
plc to turn out for local musical
events. This weekend’s presenta-
tions by Mr. Cockrcll of the Music
Dept. and by the Albany Sym~
phony were both well attended
and, I might add, well received.
Mr. Cockrell’s performance was
packed to overflow Friday and to
almost that level Sunday after-
noon; the Albany Symphony al-
most succeeded in filling the Pa]-
ace H a formidable achievement for
any organizalion.

Cockrell‘s concert, the fourth in
his Beethoven Sonata series was.
on the whole, quite excellent, the
only weak spots being a bad start
in the finale of the A flat sonata
of opus 26. (This review is of
Sunday’s concert). Coekrell recov-
ered immediately, however. and
wont on to thoroughly charm his
audience. which was expecting a
lot in this program of the more
popular sonatas. llis execution of
the famous “l\‘loonlight" sonata
was (|lllll' good and lhe audience
was visibly satisfied. but it was his
performance of Opus EH, llit-
“l’astorale” that deserVes special
commendation. This sonata seems

to fit Mr. Cockrell‘s temperament
ideally, and he played it. beauti-
fully, especially in the scherzo and
made sections of the work. Also
worth special mention was his
performance of the finale of the E
Flat sonata ending the first half of
the concert. All in all, quite an
enjoyable aflernoon.

“The Salute to Students" done
by the Albany Symphony (the
sub-title of the concert didn’t.
appear on the program) was also
Well received except for Xenakis'
“l‘ithoprakta,” which can best be
described to the aVernge listener as
"different." The work, for strings.
woodblock, two tromboncs. xylo-
phone, and strings (each stringed
instrument with its own part).
consisted of a remarkable number
of strange and complex sounds.
some of them emitting from a
not-ton-tolcrant. audience. It is to
the everlasting credit of l'lt'gui
that ilwsymphony performed this
piece. It is very inoflen that an
orehcslra beset by fimmcial wor-
ries (what orchestra isn’t?) es»
peeially in a not very “arty” town
(like Albany). would dare frighten
its audience with an “uncomforta-
ble” piece of music, i can‘t say I
like il, but I'm damn glad they
played it,

Bread And Puppet People '

by Steve Aminoff

Sometimes you feel as though
you‘re a puppet in this vast. quag-
mire mortals call the terrestial
plane always being brought before
some magistrate of varying size
and signiﬁcance who decides a
fate for you which has been de-
creed long before. And THAT.
ladies and gentlemen. was the
head I was into after I left the
Main Theater of the Performing
Arts Center wltcrc I had just. seen
the Bread and Puppet. Theater's
production of “The Birdealeher in
Hell (Akyogcn)".

There was nothing regular about
this night at PAC. I walked inside
the lobby just in time to see
plaster-masked pcoplc' dressed in
ceric white hand me morsels of
this intriguing sour-dough. It was
interesting to see. many of the
patrons interrupt their precious
small talk to accept this offering. I
actually watched the {ghostly
quality of these mother-like erea‘
lures become the pale expressions
of the people who came in con-
laet with them.

FORREST WESTBROOK
This Is ’l‘hcir Time. Oh Yes
(Revelation Records)

All the musicians in this album
extract a particularly beautiful
sound from their instrument.
Pianist Forrest Westbrook glides
delicately and smoothly from
note to note. Paul Ruliland
matches Ray Brown for a full,
deep sound on bass. Drummer
Dick Wilson carefully introduces
the listeners ear to peruussivu out
pourings that range from gentle to
thunderous, but always strikineg
novel. Jim West has that glassy
“Mill. Jackson-ish" reproduction
on vibes and marimba.

Although I doubt, that, any of
these musicians could stand alone
as a soloisl, they perform magnil'iv
cently together.They seem, in
fact, to thrive on one another,
feeding each other ideas, digesting
these ideas and excreting a totally
new one. but consistnntly in line
with its predecessor. In this way
they run the gamut of moods,
rhythms. and textures within a
single piece.

No one really solos for tiny
length of Lime and the whole
movement of each of the two
pieces seems to be dependent on
this high rate of exchange.

There can be no doubt of the
total originality of those involved.

 

The time the doors open and the
beginning of the performance are
simultaneously 8:30. We chompcd
down the rest. of ottr bread and
entered the Main Theater as the
play got underway. The Bread and
Puppet people look me comv
pleter by surprise. I Wits im»

Record

The music seems at, times to be
unpreeedented. The most reliable
lertn for describing these sounds
would he “third stream” because
it has the interdependence and
unity of a classical composition,
yet it contains the spontaneity.
and pulse of jazz. ii. is also totally
improvized.

There are some wondrous things
taking place on this album; things
thal havn never been recorded iii
quitt- this way. It is joyful, sur-
rowi‘ul, swinging and most of all
very. very good music. Superb
mttsie, as a matter of fact.

This record can be purchased by

pressed by the way in which
western images could be painted
on an oriental theme so smoothly.
The voice—work was apt whether it
entailed thc falsetto shrills of
“Primadonnu” (played by Pam
McDonald). or the hoarse hol-
lering of the King of Death
(howled by Avram Patt).

The thing that captivated most
completely, however. was the
fluidity of the movement. There
Wits grace yet strength in the
definitive strides of the players. I
was treated to an absolutely flaw-
lcss “old man" complete with the
delicate handling of a crickcty
branch that served as a cane, and
some carefully calculated foot-
work in the form of slow, de-
liberate steps.

Due to the beauty of the perfor-
mance in cchution, one was
allowed to spend more lime
looking til the symbolic sig-
nificance of the actions of the
characters. The mood was clearly
established from the very outset.
it was simply that elusive
“message” which had to be found
Il()\V.

Certain images were certainly
stronger in my mind than others, I
mean those flashes of Nixon were
intense to say the least. But I kept
myself focused on that cretinous—
looking little old man. He was not
only the person who ushered in
the presentation with his opening
hobblc across the stage. but he
seemed to bring things to a close
with the abrupt demolition of his
branch-cane and his exit off-stage
carrying one of those ominous
“shroud crmturts" whom the
audience had become quite fam-
iliar with by now.

Many thanks should be relayed
to the Bread and Puppet Theater
for the refreshing breeze of per-
mitting us to see something pretty
exciting. They also put on this
“street theatre" type thing called
“White-washing the Dirty Sheets
of Attica" in front of the PAC
that afternoon. We dug it.
