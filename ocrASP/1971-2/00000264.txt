Doctor of Arts
Program Planned

by Diane Dilz
Air ASP Feature

The State University of New
York at Albany is now distin-
guished as being the first institu-
tion in New York State as well its
New England to offer the Doctor
of Arts Degree.

In June, 1970, SUNYA was one
of ten institutions, now twelve,
granted funds by the Carnegie
Corporation of New York for the
development of the Doctor of
Arts Programs. As a
planning groups at work last year,
the University Scnutc at Albany
approved programs. The
trustees recommendation was for-
warded to the Board of Regents,
who in turn approved the “[11-

result of

th rce

mcndmcnt and recommended it
to the governor’s office. The gov-
ernor‘s office reported that the
governor signed the amend-
ment on August 8, 1971, in a

letter to Commissioner N yq u int.

Programs in economics tind
English began immediately this
fall. The English department
granted admission to four stu~
dents; one has since withdrawn.
Each received a graduate follow-
ship to enable him to pursue his
studies. The economics tit-part-
ment has granted Doctor of Arts

This past State
University had three proposed Doc
tor of Arts programs evaluated in
English, economics and physics.
Faculty of the University ofMich-
igtiit, thv Univvrsity of Washington
and thc Carnegie-Mellon Univer-
sity gnvr- high praise to the English

summer, the

and economics programs. One re-
viewer said, " The English propo-
sul could well be tl seminal model
nationally for the Doctor of Arts
that disci-
pline." One reviewer raised ques-

chree programs in

tions about the physics program,
questioning the breadth of cog-
nritc study. Because of this, the
physics program came back to
Albany for reconsideration. The
program is now ready for resub-
mission to the central office.

Other Doctor of Arts programs
nrt- being dt-vclopcd tit SUNYA.
Programs in French rind Spaniin
have been forwarded to the grad-
uiitc academic council, The De-
piirtmcnt of Classics is working on

tor of Arts Degree in literature
Llllll. wotild cut across national and
linguistic boundaries, and the
School of Library and Informa-
tion Science has expressed interest
in development of it new degree
pattern for subject bibliogrtiphcrs.

Dr. Arthur Collins, Professor of
English and head of a Doctor of
Arts Planning group at SUNYA,
discussed some of the implications
of the degree.

“SUNYA has assumed louder-
ship in an important reform in
graduate education. We shrill con-
tinue to develop new degree [nil-

turns with confidence that the

changes they introduce are both
sound and desirable. In preparing
[catchers for graduate school pro-
grams, higher education has tund-
('(l to overlook the necessity of
preparing undergraduate ti-iichcrs
withsolid academic foundations,
well developed teaching skills, and
:in appreciation of scholarly rc-
search."

admissions

Since department

committees will be concerned
with the total number of doctoral
candidates in the two programs,
Dr. Collins feels that either doc-
torzitc does not actually have it
fixed quota to fill. Neither the
economics nor the English depart-
ment is seeking the expansion of
its faculty by building up it griid-
uutc enrollment.

Dr. Collins sttitcd, “We Wllill to

The Doctor of Arts degree will
offer highly qualified college in-
structors. Doctor Collins added,
“The intellectqu climate of today
favors a rctisscrtion of the import-
tincc of the college teacher. This
climutc developed out of student
discontent with university teach-
ing, that sometimes (us at Berkley
and Columbia) manifested itself in
strikes and riots. It has led to the
next emphasis across the country
on teacher evaluation. The Doctor
of Arts degree is no panacea, but
it meets complaints of graduate
students about the overspecialized
training offered them. It provides
for the training and teaching
which undergraduates have com-
plained that faculties have lacked,
and it offers to undergraduate
colleges, especially two year col-
Ir-ges, faculty with experience in
teaching, tian with the expecta-
tion thiit they will be rewarded
for the touching they do and the
students they assist rather than
for the articles or books they may
write.
