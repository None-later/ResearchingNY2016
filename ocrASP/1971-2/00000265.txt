BootersTrip Stony Brook, 4-2

Despite the talent of their two
all-conference forwards, Aaron
George and Solomon Mensah,
Stony Brook's offense could not
get uncorked against a psyched
Albant State team as the Danes
dumped Stony Brook, 4-2, for
their second win of the season.
The Danes, who in their first five
games scored only four goals, e-

fire as they have not done pre-
viously this year. Carloa Alvarez
got the rebound of a shot off the
8.3. goalie to give Albany a lead
they were not to reliquish for the
rest of the afternoon. In the se-
cond period Micheal scored on
assists from Alvarez at 12:00 and
16:48 to give him a hat trick and
the Danes a comfortable lead at

Danes were John Thayer who
registered nineteen saves at goalie,
and freshman fullback Evan Con-
gress, who consistently managed
to slow the Stony Brook attack.

Other good news on the soccer
scene is the suddenly powerful
J.V. with three consecutive wins
this week. After losing their first

theJ.V. are Leon Sedafian, Mario
Fleurant, and Dale Cobane, on
defense Mick Walker and goalie
Steven Carlsen. Their next effort
will be at home next Saturday
against the Brooklyn College J.V.
at 1 PM.

Bernie Boggs

by Bill Heller
I walked into Bernic's room and was greeted instantly by the
friendliest 5'8" 190 lb. tailback I'll probably cvcr mcct. He's an
easygoing guy and the interview went really well.
BernieI transferred to Albany last year from Temple. As H freshman,
he started on the fresh team there, on the crux of ll scholarship. Hc
transferred for a lot of reasons. First of all, he didn't like the pressure
