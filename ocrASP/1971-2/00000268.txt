E.O.P. Student. Association

Towards Separatism
Or Community?

by Michael Lampert
AN ASP COLUMN

Mitch Frost’s column in the
October 15, 1971 ASPralong with
the news coverage before then,
would have us believe that the
money appropriated to the E.O.P.
Student Association created an
organization parallel to, and sep-
arate from, the Student Asso-
ciation. This is just not so.

None of the funds appropriated
will be spent without the usual
signature of either the President ,
Vice-President, or Controller of
the Student Association. This
regulation applies to all Student
Association groups, including the
new E.O.P. Student Association.

The new group is a club, just
like the International Students
Association, the Ski Club, the
Biology Club, and all other clubs;
its constitution was approved, as
all of the other‘s were, by the
Student Association.

The E.O.P. Student Association
budget request included money
for services S.A. already provided,
and Central Council was careful to
remove these funds before having
approved the bill.

Given, then that the E.O.P. Stu-
dent Association‘s appropriation
is subject to the exact same con-
trol as any other S.A. constituted
and budgeted group, i find it hard
to understand how this can be
interpreted as a “separatist”
move.

It is a much more tenable con-
tention that this is a move which
will lead to a greater sense of
community. Student Association
has, for the first time, recognized
that it has an obligation to pro-
gram for cultures other than our
white middle-class one. Now we
have a vehicle to do this. The
officers of the E.O.P. Student
Association and the officers of the
Student Association have worked
closely in bringing this proposal to
the Council; they are working
closely to make the proposal oper-
ational; and they will work closely
to make other clubs and groups
more relevant to all cultures on
campus.

Some people might quarrel with
the size of the appropriation. If,
however, one accepts the principle
that most S.A. programming is
relevant only to the majority
white middle class, and that a
mandatory tax requires pro-
gramming for all students, then a
substantial appropriation to an
agency for minority student pro-
gramming, such as the E.O.P. Stu-
dent Association, is undoubtedly
justified. And the effect of
bringing blacks and whites to-
gether in a community , not a-
dversary way will haVe inval-
Liable benefits for years to come.
Or, to put it another way, We will
have one Student Association fair-
ly and equitably representing the
entire student body.

Vote “No” On Bond Issue

by Jay Hashmall
AN ASP COLUMN

On Election Day, voters throughout the state will
have the opportunity to Vote “NO” on Proposition
One-Transportation Bond Issue. And so they
should.

Governor Rockefeller seems to have an extreme
attachment to cement, construction and destruc-
tion. Look around you at the artistic mass of
cement called SUNYA. See how the state and
interstate highway system cries-crosses the land with
stifling asphalt arms. View the site of the Mall
Project downtown. And visualize how much more
harm $1.15 billion of highway construction would
do. It would not only be a waste of an enormous
amount of money that could do more good some-
where clsc; additional construction of interstate
highways would ruin our environment not only with
its unsightly sterility, but by separating farm lands,
increasing noise levels, displacing homes and
covering over what still remains of the “o'pen
country.”

lhe ASP suggested in an editorial that you accept
all r-l this waste and destruction in return for the
$1,353 billion that would be granted for mass
transportation. But this is wrong. Would one accept
a war as a compromise to stabilise the economy?
Would one appropriate liirge amounts of money to
the defense department to obtain a token pledge for
poverty programs? Did the voters in New York
State in l967 accept a new state constitution
because with all of the bad they would have

received some good? The answers are obvious. The
voters should turn down Rockefeller‘s already in-
f1ated highway program no matter how well he
sugar coats it. And the voters should press for
separate legislation to provide for direct subsidalion
and capital expenditures to maintain improvt‘ and
modernize not only the New York City subway
system, but all mass transportation in all of the
state‘s metropolitan areas.

And Proposition One is not the only proposal that
voters must evaluate on November 2nd. Also on this
year‘s ballot are two amendments to llTI‘ state
constitution, one for community developemenl and
another for sewage development. These both (Ir--
serve voter approval. The first would allow Illc slain
and local governments to directly undertake coin-
munity development on their own without I‘I‘l‘JIlIg
on the private sector, which it has never llllfl-llit‘
authority to do, And the second amendment would
remove sewage projects from the debt limit call-gory
which would take them out of competition with
higher priority expenditures like education and
highways and allow proper attention to be liit'llsl'tl
on their own merits.

Voters must not be apathetic. They must [can]
about all of the candidates and issues on llll' ballot,
this year and every year. To not vote all all on any
issue or political race is to take out of your hands a
choice which should be yours. Remember in mi.-
on election day, and if you are voting by alisi-iilo-i-
ballot, remember to mail it in as soon as possiblv' ll
must reach your local Board of Elections by noon
on the Monday before election day.
