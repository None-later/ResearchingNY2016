Racism Not Yet Combatted

MARCY, NY. (AP) — Dr. Olivia
Stokes, professor of Education at
Columbia University College, told
the opening of an International
Workshop to Combat Racism and
Discrimination Sunday that ef-
forts to and racism in this country
are “miniscule."Discussing institu-
tional racism during her keynote
address, Dr. Stokes said what hap-
pened at Attica State pison last
month was a prime example.

“The murders there were in-
human decisions on the part of
the governor and his clan," she
said. I‘Most Americans don't real-
ize that this was a religious insur-
rection.” She said one of the
prime requests of the rebellious
Attica inmates was political asy-
lum in another country.

“This country was built by pris-
oners from England. They were
sent to America to build it,” she
said. “The prisoners at Attica
were asking for the same thing.
The difference was, howevar, that
they asked government’s con-
sent,"

“Two more days in the negotia-
tions at Attica would have made a
signiﬁcant difference in the out-
come,” Dr. Stokes comtinued,
“and 43 would be alive today.”
She said she agreed that the pri-
soners must be punished for their
crimes but added that conditions
in prisons are such that they are
suffering “double indemnity.H

NEW DELHI (AP) DriVen from
their homeland, unwanted in their
adapted land and seemingly for-
gotten by the international com-
munity, the East Pakistan refugees
struggle every day just to stay
aliVe.

Many don’t make it.

Mnkeshift cremation sites send
up endless columns of smoke a-
long India’s 1,349-mile border
with East Pakistan. The area is
crammed with 600 “fugee camps.

Cholera, malnutrition, exhaus-
tion, floods, poor or nonexistent
sanitation facilities and lack of
shelter and clothing take a heavy
toll, especially among children.

Health officials say at least
6,000 refugees have died of cho»
lera alone and that other death
statistics are not available. By
conservative estimates, at least
100 die daily.

Seven months Lifter the influx
began, following the outbreak of
civil war in East Pakistan, the
refugees still come across the bor-
der, carrying their few belongings
on their heads and sometimes
elderly relatives in their arms.

The Indian government reports
9% million refugees, almost equal
to the population of Michigan, or
Greater New York. Pakistan claims
there are only two million.

United Nations officials say that
regardless of the exact number the
refugees represent one of the
greatest human tragedies of mod-
ern times.

The Indian gOVernment has giv«
en the East Pakistanis food out of
its own buffer stocks and diverted

money for refugee relief from
planned development projects. It
hopes to get reimbursed by the
international community.

But the amount pledged so far
by other nations, about $200 mil-
lion, leaves a large gap. The In-
dians expect they will have to
spend five times that by the end
of next March, if the refugees are
still in India.

“These people are here on a
temporary basis," Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi says. “We cannot
allow them to settle in India. The
sooner they go back, the less
chance there will be of any kind
ofconflagration.”

The problem has brought India
and Pakistan to the brink of a war
that could well cause even more
refugees on both sides of the
border,

There also is a danger that the
refugees may spark riots within
India, Tension has risen in border
areas. Local residents, themseIVes
improverished, are jealous of the
refugees for getting free food and
clothing.

To avoid possible I'lareups, the
refugees are being forced to re-
main inside their camps. Some
have armed guards.

The United Nations says 3 '/2 mil-
lion blankets, about one for each
family, are needed to stave off
mass deaths due to exposure. On-
ly 1V2 million are expected.

“Even the relief workers are
getting despondent," says one
U.N. worker. "There is no end in
sight to the problem. You can
stretch and push yourself for a
limited time. But not this open-
ended thing."

Absentee Ballots Questioned

ballot for this year's election might be invalid,
according to AI Walker, a Stonybrook student, and
from theI seventeenth dis-

tee ballot forms contain the names of two imaginary
liberal candidates. Both Martin Ccrini (seventeenth)
and Ruth Waltey (eighteenth) withdrew from the
election on August ll. Election Commissioner, Frank
Coventry, conﬁrmed on Wednesday, Oct. III, that the
“this is true,“ referring to their withdrawals.

Students Learn That History
Can Be Taught With Films

This year, in the field of Russian

History, in order to break away
from the traditional survcy
courses which involve teaching
from texts and other source ma-
terials, a one-semester experi-
mental and inpagjativc, film-
oriented course coisisting of a
series of sixteen Russian-made
films and twelve lectures is being
conducted. The Person respon-
sible for this new approach is
Russian History professor, Dr.
Michael Cherniavsky.

The films for his course are
being funded by Dean Wheeler,
the History Department and the
Russian club in return for viewing
them at club meetings. The E.C.C.
(Educational Communications
Center) has provided slides for
instructional use. The course will
cost cost approximately 650 dol-
Iarr; but this is only due to the
help of various people who are
voluntarily working for a minimal

fee. A course of this nature would
otherwise cost upwards of 800
dollars. Roger Conant, the gradu-
ate studenl assistant to Dr. Chern-
iavsky, deserves credit for helping
to design and set up this course.
The essence of this course is an
attempt to examine Russian
society through its popular cul-
ture, including Its art and litera
ture, about which mass media can
furniin great insight. 'I‘he endea-
vor to cvoIVc this was based on a
desire to break away from the
chronological approach and to
deal with treating a specific prob-
lem. Outside readings are assigned
and his films are supplemented by
interpretations and lectures. But
Dr. Cherniavsky feels that without
the films, his lectures would not
make sense and vice—Versa because
he is trying to tie both in with the
continuity of the subject.
Previously, Dr. Cherniavsky
taught from Russian history texts
which were primarily written in

the Russian language. Since the
majority of the students could not
read Russian, they had to take his
word for what the texts said. Dr.
CherniaVsky felt this was a danger
in this method. He considers the
new method more challenging be-
cause the students can see every-
thing and judge for themselves
and might come out with totally
different interpretations. He be-
lieves that the period of Russian
history which his class is studying,
“The Soviet Era” (1917 to the
present) lends itself well to his
new mehtods whereas other
periods in history or other sub-
jects might not.

In Dr. Cherniavsky's words,
"Another advantage to using films
is that they are a form of art and
art is autobiographical even to the
degree that it tries to distort
something. A man gives more
away in a work of art than in a
manuscript If it is genuine, he
must put himself into it. So,

Gay Lib Group Forming

by Richard Roy

One of the dangers -of con-
sidering issues in an academic at-
mosphere is precisely the point
that they can stay just that—
academic. When dealing with an
issue such as the plldlt of sister
and brother homosexuals on this
campus one can hardly afford to
remain academic. It is a problem
that has ramifications far too
deeply embedded and intertwined
in the social slruclurc of everyday
campus life. This problem was,
indeed, taken from its academic
isululioll and brought into practi
cal reality in Humanities 12~| last
Wednesday awning. ’I‘he SUNYA
(lay Alliance, formed —that
evening, was a direct outgrowth of\
the October Iii Moratorium. 'I‘he
organmrlion's objective is to end
the oppri-ssion of gays on the
SUNYA campus by confronting,
opposing, and ovorcoming various
elements of repression such as the
Health Services staff, housing
rules, ale, and by a general pro—
cess of education for students.
faculty, and administration cori-
coming the tnul nature of homo-
sexuality in the continuum of
sexual behavior. 'l'he meeting that

evening was attended by over Tit]
sisters and brothers whose en-
thusiasm and co-operation gavu
promise of a strong organization

One of me main concerns of the
Alliance is LO,op.n channels of
communication—most im-
portantly with gay sisters and
brothers on campus who realize
their sexual gravitations but who,
for various reasons, are unable to
deal with the situation in con-
structive positive terms. The Al-
liance will set up a counseling
service operated through Crisis
5300 I r this purpose. This will be
in operation in the very near
future.

One may question the need for a
gay organization on campus. One
may also question the need of a
light for people fumbling about’in
the darkness-the analogy is clear.
For the past week the SUNYA
Gay Alliance has I‘lld a table set
up in the Campus Center. The
reactions have ranged from favor-
able to indifferent to hostile, with.
the majority on the favorable” end.
Last Monday evening at 10 pm.
the Guy Alliance broadcasted an
interview over WSUA INhich
sought to introduce people to the
idea of a gay organization on
campus and at the same time tp
debunk sortie of the myths con-
cI-I‘ning homosexuals. The
SUNYA Gay Alliance, as all other
guy organizations in the move-
ment. does not seek to build walls
but to span bridges‘does not seek
to polarize but to expand and
integrate. To achieve this the
group will need the co-operntion
and openness of both gays and
“straights” ‘n open and honest
dialogue. The Alliance's meetings
are open to all, regardless of
sexual orientation. It iii hoped
that these niceings will be con-
sidered an open forum to the
entire academic community. The
next meeting will be held this
Wednesday evening at 8 p.m. at a
place to be announced in the ASP.
