the seven and one engineers who
are red hot, winning their last
seven in a row. The Danes will try
to use the high ﬂying spirit of the
engineers against them by playing
a tough aggressive game. Last year
the R.P.l. team came into the
Albany game on top of the world
and the Danes nearly pulled a
tremendous upset. losing only
after throwing the game into over-
time. The engineers once again
will be led by their two all-
American forwards Casey Trappeir
berg and Lucky Kumanga,

The Danes who lost a tough
game last Saturday to Cortland
State. 2-1, are very up for the
game and will be out to burst the
R.P.l. bubble. The Engineer's
coach seems to agree to a certain
extent this week saying. “Albany
State is a far better team than its
record would seem to indicate."
The Albany offensewill be out to
prove this Wednesday.

The J.\’. is on the winning track
again after being stopped by
R,P.l. J.V. last week 3-2 by beak

their sounds. Attempting to play
rock n' roll with two acoustic
guitars. an electric bass. and
drums proved to be a little less
than Joyous Noise.

Next was Leo Kotke. Reputed
to be a master of 6 and 12 string
guitars, Kotke was not at home in
the acoustically poor gym and
couldn't communicate with the
audience. His music was there if
you wanted to grab a hold but it
was very easy to be neutral about
it and many were. A proper
appreciation of his talent would
have been easier if he had per-
formed at a coffee house but a
general impression was that he
would have been better off with a
small back-up group. And a course
in RPA 104.

By the time Joy of Cooking
made their appearnce there were
more discarded programs than
pcoplc in the gym. True to their
name. the group cooked but not
at the 550 degrees 1“ that most
wanted to melt to. Too much
limi- was spent lrying lo gcl those
Icl't to clap along and this occured
during the two Iii-st songs of llic

was law in arriving. was as poor as
usual. There was feedback galore
and too many interruptions bev

he played it. Sitting on the

listening to only two of music is
not a pleasant rulio.
