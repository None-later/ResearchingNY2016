"Law an: Order"
A Solution

If you‘ve read the statistics in the past few issues of
the ASP, you know that crime on catnpus is on the rise.
With crime goes violence, or a strong risk of it.
Exposure to violence has a definite effect on pt-oph-;

Conflicting Replies
To the Editor:

A little juxtaposition here aiid there is very
interesting at times. I found it so when comparing
Jerry Lee's and Michael Iaimpert‘s reply to Mitch
Frost's coltimn. lt seems that. Jerry antl Michael are
both interested in justifying the creation of the

his words really mean. Before you place a fist within
ti Jewish star on your chest, consider whether or not.
those two symbols are in any way comparable. And
before yott utter pride and dignity as terms to be
believed in, consider whether your definitions are
the same as Kahane's. And if they aren't, then by

with your every breath: but don‘t allow his means
to become yours!

obnoxious students deliver for many blame the
fallacies of the system upon the student in charge.

A look at the main desk will reveal an incessant
amount of cards to be filed and books to be slipped.
A Week to ten days is not a” bad estimate for the
time ititukesfor a book to return to the shelves. Just
look at all the carts of books throughout‘ the library

To the custodial aiitl security personnel:

should be enforced to a high degree, I feel that
