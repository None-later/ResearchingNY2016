Harriers Host
Invitational

X Country

The ﬁfth annual State Universi-
ty at Albany Cross-Country Invi-
tational is expected to attract
nearly 400 atheltes in three divi-
sions Saturday. The varsity race,
scheduled to begin at 12:40 PM,
will involve some 215 runners
from 27 schools. The juniorpollege
race will start at ‘noon and the
junior varsity at 1:20.

The team favorite is Central
Connecticut, but stiff opposition
is anticipated from defending
champion C.W.Post, Springfield,
Syracuse, Colgate, Paterson State,
and Albany, with Union rating the
role of darkhorse. Thelhost Great
Danes, 9-2 in dual meets prior to a
Wednesday date against Colgate,
already have won the 17-team
Merrimack Invitational and the
I I-team SUNY Conference Cham-
pionships the past two weekends.

Ron Stonitsch, the All-American
from C.W.Post, won the individual
title the last three years setting
a course mark each time. He has
graduated and at least eight men
are given a chance to succeed him
as champion. With that kind of
competition, his 24:15.5 record
on the five-mile course may be
threatened.

Leading contenders include Tom
Fleming of Paterson State, who
finished second to Stonitsch last
fall; Bruce Fischer of Syracuse,
third in 1970; Ed Walkwitz and
Charlie Duggans of Springfield;
John Juffrcy of Colgate; Dave
Ellis of Central Conn,; and a pair
of arm frosh stars, Albany's Brian
Quinn and Sit-na's Joc Rukansha-
giza.

’l‘hi- junior college division will
include an vslimalcd 75 runners
representing it) schools. Powerful
Johnson and Wales from fProvi-
deuce, 11.1., is the heavy favorite,
with main competition provided
by dcfcnding titlist Suffolk Com-
rnunily College, Nassau CC, and
Mohawk Valley C.C.

Anothcr 12 teams and 100
runners are entered in the JV
division Both the JV and junior
college raccs will be run on the
3.5 mile course, on which the
record is 172251, set by Fischer
when he won the forsh race two
yl‘ill‘S 111:0.

Following the Invitational, past
and present members of Albany
cross-country teams will join
coach Bob Munscy to celebrate
the sport's 10th anniversary at the
univcrsity.
