1‘2 years of existence, the number
of stores has risen to Ill and the
variety of stores has greatly ex

the leading commercial industrial
I'ealtors in Albany, and the Plaza's
president and builder is Lewis A.
Swyer, who also built the Sara-

buses from the uptown campus to
Stuyvesant. She explained that

provide transportation for the
students. This service began in
1968. Last year, the buses ran on
Monday and Friday evenings and
on Saturday; this year a Wednes-
day evening bus has been added,
“The buses work out nicely for
StuyVi-sant Plaza and for the uni-
versity community, especially in
the winter," Miss Leslie added.

Of special interest to SUNYA
students is a play that will be

presented by one of our per-
forming arts groups on November
6th at the Plaza. weather per‘
milling. The name of the play is
“Land of the Dragon"; more dev
tails will be forthcoming. Miss
Leslie also mentioned the plans
for Christmas involving the Plaza,
including decorations, caroling,
and, of course, Santa Claus. She
hopes to be able to bring some
children from the orphanages in
the Albany area to the Plaza to
participate in Christmas celebra-
lions, and she would appreciate
any help or suggestions from
students Anyone interested

Phosphates
Not Harmful i

Eighty to 85% of US. homes
“cannot harm the environment by
using detergents containing phos-
phates,“ Howard Morgens, newly
named Proctor St Gamble chair-
man, told the annual stock-
holders' meeting.

Even where there is a eutrophi-
cation problem, Mr. Morgens said,
improved sewage treatment may
by the best solution, rather than
removal of phosphates from de-
tergents. He added that there are
no safe substitutes for phosphates
in detergents at this time, but that
P &. (i will continue to seek
alternatives.

Philatelic Graffiti

The craze for graffiti is one
company's prime advertising
medium. New Yorkers are seeing
“Philatelic exhibit 256 West 54
St." chalked on walls, posters,
subway pillars, and fences around
construction sites. It's the brain-
storm of Broadway Stamp 00.,
which devotes its ad budget to
chalk. Says a spokesman: “It‘s
cheap, it's unusual, and nobody
can draw mustaches on it."

Controversial Can-stabbing

DuPont‘s controversial can-stabbing Zerex commercial is back on
the air virtually unchanged, in spite of the Federal Trade Commis-
sion's notice of “intent to complain" issued last NUVember.

Since then, officials of the FTC and Du Pont haVe been trying to
work out a compromise "consent" agreement, but the commercial is
being shown as if the FTC had never raised the subject.

The only changes in the commercial this year, which is being shown
through November on prime network time as well as in an extensive
spot campaign, are an initial announcement that “We're back,” and a
one sentence warning that cooling systems should be thoroughly
flushed before Zerex is used. However, Eric Bogadell, account exec at
BBDO, emphasized that this change had nothing whatever to do with
the l“'l‘(‘, and that no steps are being taken to accommodate the FTC.
"As lliey have not taken any official steps, we are not making any real

adjustments," said Mr. Bogadell.

lloWeVer, in Washington, the director of the F’I‘C's bureau of
consumer protection said that he “hopes to sue to settle" the
controversy over the Zerex commercial “very, very shortly."

ltohert Pitofsky, whose sub-
ordinates handle lhe commission’s
litigating staff in the advertising
field, said negotiations in the case
have dragged out longer than any
other since he came to FTC 18
months ago.

His comments were offered
during a news conference, when a
reporter asked why the Zerex
commercial was still running,
despite the serious charges which
FTC raised against it at a news
conference last November. One
reporter said: “You are giving them
a whole second season by letting
them use the commercial now."

In announcing its intention to
proceed against the commercial,
FTC contended last November that
the demonstration of Zerex
stopping a radiator leak is false
because the pressure in an auto
radiator is different [him the pres»
sure in the can used on TV. FTC
also contended the product can
harm a radiator which contains any
rust.

'l'he FTC‘s proposed settlement
called for an affirmative statement
in future ads and labels warning of
the potential damage to cars. FTC
said that it. a satisfactory warning
could not be devised, it would
consider banning the product from
the market.

Mr. Pitofsky refused to speculate
about the chances for a consent
settlement. He noted the FTC
could not have stopped the iid even
if litigation was under way, until a
filial decision has been reached. He
admitted negotiations had extended
longer than he considers satis-
factory.
