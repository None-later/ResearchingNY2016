by Jeffrey P. Bernstein
An ASP Column

With the leaves turning all sorts
of magnificent colors and a 36
exposure roll of Kodacolor depos-
ited in my camera, I figured the
time was right for Ii pilgrimage to
the Mohawk campus. So after an
excruciating weekend of eating
and sleeping Bio 101, which all
minated in a Monday night exam,
I planned an excursion to that
FSA country retreat off Exit 8 of
the Northway for the following
Saturday. For those of you plair
Iiiug a day in the country here's

A brilliant sun, the lone visible
object in the vast blue sky, was
showing off the non-
chlorophyllose pigments of the
leaves in beautiful yellows,
oranges, and reds. But the sun was
going to have to perform power-
fully to dry off the thick dew on
the grass My shoes were soaking
itp water faster than my pliyladen-

bought half a pound of cheese

At Crime’s Heart: Heroin

by Al Seiiiii

Beneath the spiraling crime rate that has plagued the campus this

full, at the heart. of the armed robbc burglaries, and petty
larcenies lies a haunting spectre: Heroin.

Scarcely a stranger to the Albany State drug scene, never has it
appeared in such proportions. “It's easier to get than ups (amphetam-
ines), says a white, middle ch. s coed on Indian Quad and indeed she is
right. This reporter had no problem making a contact to purchase a
quantity of the white powder, and neither would any other
enterprising student who has a little ingenuity and some ready cash.

The c‘ mpus has become a near haven for heroin this year and the
ramifi I ions of this unfortunate truth are evident not only to the
iiicre scd number Iif students who are snorting, skin popping, chip-
ping and mainliniiig, but also to those in the campus community who
have had a knife (or gun) put to their throats and their cash
confiscated

l“l‘hcse are the lirI'IIa-Ii type of crimes III-mg coniniittcd,“ les
Ass ant Security Director James (lIiiiiially “’l‘lie perpetrators are
looking for quick cash.., the increase in these types of crimes Is
fantastic this y 

And the causi. 'l‘lic uanr leaves little to the iiiiagiiialiou.“’l‘hcrc's
no question in my mind that the iIIcr Ise III these types of crimes (use
of heroin and personal crimes) is related," ('olitinlly adds. uMost
administrators, student government leaders, and eVeii campus radicals
are agreeing with his analysis.

I iys l‘l.().P Director Vernon Buck. “The Mommy is a direct result
of a drug Iiced." Neil Brown III the Student Affairs Office echoes this
same messiin “’I‘Iiere Is no doubt in my mind that the Increase in
crime on our campus is directly related to the use of hard drugs,
including licl'oiii, The Student Affairs staff is iiicrc singly aware of the
dimensions of the problem and Is [.irlicipaliiig extensively III action
programs relating to the problem "

NEW ISSUES

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

As Brown 's statement indicates, it Is a pmhp-m willi many
dimensions. and a few Viable solutions 'l‘hci'e Is no way one can
pinpoint the exact number of addicts on campus this year, biil
available hard drug sources Iiuniher front four to seVI-ii and

and It is only It guess of how many addicts are net
support that trade would be about one hundred “li‘rom s .
that with have (leiilt with so far," says Dick ’l‘ryon, co-ordiiiiilor for
the campus Middle Earth, an on muipus' drug and crisis center, "Ii
calculated guess would be about 100." But 'l‘ryon Is Veliement is his
I -rtioii that “It is only an inadequately calculated guess."

The crux of the problem centering around the drugi 'llt‘ is: Should
the univr-rsity community play It role in the deon Iion effort"
Some students how gone through the procedure in offcampus drug
programs, but the facilities are limited and often inadequate

Vernon Buck is pushing for ii program run entirely by students, who
would make all major policy (lecisioiis and \Vliitrh, hopefully, the
:ulministration would back. He wants the housing office to authorize
the use of chI‘I'IIl suites on campus where addicts and sllltll'uts could
begin rcliabihtnlIVc cl'foi‘ts,“iii the atmosphere of mutual support iiiiil
trust " llticli asserts that since the addict is “a basically Insecure
person" It follows that “openness and honesty among students
Would help him bent it."(tlie heroin habit)

'l'ryoii is another who feels that cleaning the addict up
threatening eiiViroiinii-iit on campus" would help the situation

llut this, of course, won. I require the university to admit piihlically
that there is a problem of uncontrollable proportions, something that
would certainly create a community backlash 'l‘licre are various legal
ramifications that would also hich to be considered Nevertheless,

Brown continued, “We're going to admit we have an institutional
problem. Not to do so is crap... Our first priority is to help the
students help them here, keeping them on campus if necessary. By
making a total commitment. to help.“

THE NON-BUST

There is a second aspect. of the heroin problem that has ramifica-
tions- for the University community: What role will security play?

This reporter has learned that as early as last spring security could
have moved against hIird drug pushers on this campus, but Security
Director James Williams and Vice President John Hartley decided not
to do so.

Albany Police Court Justice 'l‘cpedino, acting on evidence supplied
voluntarily and without. the use of undercover agents, swore out five
search warrants last yci iimed solely at hiird drug pushers. Four of
the pushers named in the warrants were black; the other was white,

Security has been told that the supply of heroin with which these
warrants~ were concerned had come from New York (lity and was cut
in Fulton Hall on Htalt' Quadrangle by two students who are no longer
at the university. The “smack” was distributed to Hamilton Hall and
Stuyvesant 'l‘owcr where “middle echelon dope pushers"began selling
it.

Assistant Director of Security James (Tonnally liiid the warrants
sworn out, but both Hurley and Williams intervened and squelched the
bust because “the information was too limited."

"What if We had gone in there and ii mistake was involvud‘.’H asked
Williams. "The students would have interpreted it as another
eslahtI-Iliiiienl trick "

llartley added, "We felt that there was II better than even chance
tlial we would have come up with nothing."

’l'hougli 'I‘epediiin felt the evidence was reliable cliouglil to issue a
search warrant. and though a group of Alliaiiy (.ounty Assistant
District Attorneys gave at least tacit agreeiiienl, Wil us and lIIirIlev
Ilid not allow police to move in because they fell the information was
faully and the student reaction, II' the raid was ttnsticcessl'ul.\vouldI)“
extremely critical.

“If we had gniie Iii, Iiiadc the bust, and come out empty," said
llartley, “We would haVe had a hell ofalotof student criticism last
yr '

Williams says his and lliirtley's suspicions were borne out when
scclirily arrested one of those named in the warrants on It lesser charge
two weeks later. llis room was searched and no drugs turned up. This,
William claims, supports his contentions that the bust should have
been nixed. NeVerthcless, the de ion has cr Iited controversy, with
opponents arguing that security “could have nipped the problem in
lllt' bud" and proponents claiming that the information was question-
able and that We" if Ii bust had been made, the effects would liiiVe
been minimal because the pushers would IIIIVI' been easily repIIICed.
