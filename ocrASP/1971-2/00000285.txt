Douglass, San Francisco 9-1114

SAN FRANCISCO-With a sigh of liberated relief, he dropped out.
He hung Iip his suit coal with patches, his pipe with matches, and
donned beads, beard, embroidered denims and a bowling shirt he got.
at an auction. He moved into a tiny apartment, built been bag chairs
and shelves on which to hang his Huxleys and Hemingways. He
became a vegetarian, did Yoga on cushions when the sun rose, studied
macrobiotics on cushions when it sci. And, like instant Karma, the
star became a chorus boy and that was that -- the beginning of a
beautiful self-indulgent. life.

That was over a year ago, when the well-read, well-bred Brooklyn-
boy-turned English-teacher (American and English Literature. Human-
ities, cl. til ), dropped out. to drop in to himself.

Now, he says, moaning one of those academic moans, “I want to
drop back in again. I‘d like to find a job Leaching somewhere. I miss
students. But it's hard to drop in...the economic situation is so... and
nobody's hiring, and..."

And his voice trails off 10 the West Coast where he lives and he
meekly looks down at. his ragged I-shirt wishing,maybe?, it were a
little Iwcedicr. You know: with those terribly academic patches so he
shouldn't wear his elbows out while leaning on that podium.

With memories of three yours at the University of Minnesota, two
yours at Mamilester College in St. Paul, “that awful your writing a
dissurIuIinn back in ‘67," and those two last yours Ill. Stanislaus
College in ’l‘urlock, Calif, Leonard Brill, aging at 35, is [he drop-out
professor.

It's happening all over the country. And Brill (please cull him Dr.
Brill) Is only one of many victims of ll biICl academic job market.
Money Is lIghI; contracts nren'l being renewed. Profs take off to
discover the Halter Life. And even ul your own campus, look around
you: you just might notice that Professor -- Oll'WlTIll.‘lUGS-lllS'nllmC?“

some alt-gum Eastern school. “0 just might be living in the hovel down
the block.

Leonard Brill Is living in the how-l down the block. “1 was
disillusioned," he said in a recent interview. "I was disillusioned with
the fact that decisions on education aren't made by the students and
faculty.

“And,” he said, “I Wilnlt‘d it your -- ll very private your -- for myself.
