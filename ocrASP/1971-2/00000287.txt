Siena Downed 31-20, Williams Stars

by Alan D. Abbey

Albany State kept its record
against Siena. their arch rivals in
the capital district spotless. with
a 31-20 victorv Saturday at Mont
Pleasant High school.

The big play of the game, the
one that broke the spirit of the
Indians, came with 37 seconds left
in the first half. After consulting
with Coach Bob Ford. quarter-
back Bill Flanagan lofted a pass
from Albany’s 20 yard line which
splitend Ed Williams caught up
with at the Siena 32. He then sped
the last yardage and scored to set
up the Danes with an 187 lead.

Albany took the opening kick-
off and drove 80 yards in 13
plays to open up the game‘s scor-
ing. Flanagan topped off the drive
with a 16 yard jaunt off right
tackle. Siena came back on the
next series of downs and tied up
the game on the twelfth play ofa
54 yard drive. Sicna’s extra point
was good. and that was crucial
early in the game.

Scoring continued to proliferate
in the ﬁrst quarter. a. tailback
Bernie Boggs took the ensuing
Indian kickoff and galloped 04
yards for a Dane score. The bril-
liant run by Boggs. the longest
play in State’s history. included a
fake reverse to Garvin I’arne. and
slicing runs up the middle and
along the sidelin-s. ’l‘he Danes led
12-7 as a result of the run. with
time left in the ﬁrst quarter.

The next score was the long pass
to Williams, the offensive star of
the game. He caught 6 of Flana-

gan's passes for a total of 150
yards. This game was the ﬁrst
time the Danes' passing attack had
any strength. The Dane defense
also excelled as they took the ball
away from Siena when they had
the ball on theAlbany six. to set
up the long score. The defense
also . the wink link in the Dane
defensive chain was the second-
ary. as Sienii's quarterback com-
pleted 18 passes for 313 yards.
Neither team lit the scoreboard
till midway in the third quarter
when Siena drova almost the
length of the ﬁeld, 98 yards, in

  

just 10 plays for their second TD.
Boggs once again took the kickoff
and put Albany in good field
position. their own 40 yard line.
Lonnie Davis and Carvin Payne
then ran the ball in for State. For
the seond time State's PAT was
blocked. and the Danes led.
24-14. with almost all of the
fourth quarter intact. Two and
one’half minutes later the Indians
tightened up the score on a I4
yard pass play.

The ball then changed hands ﬁve
times in the next seven minutes as
neither the Danes. who wanted to

eat up the clock, or the Indians
who needed to score again. c'ould
hold onto it. With four minutes
left, Ted Merrill picked offa Siena
pass and ran it back 64 yards to
the Indian 6 yard line. Two plays
later. Payne smashed off right
guard for his second TD of the
game. and the socre took its final
position: 31-20 State.

The victory Saturday was the
Dane's ﬁrst win ever on foreign
turf and assured them of bettering
last year’s record. The Danes are
already 3—2 and have three to go,
