Day Care Opening Delayed
Due to Insufficient Funds

by Howard Mahler

The Parents 00-01) for Day Care
remains in the registration period
of planning. No opening date has
been announced.

Problems in registration and
opening were discussed at a
meeting held Wednesday, Nov-
ember 3. The Co-op needs funds
for insurance and staff in order to
open and plans to approach Cen-

Benezet :

tral Council for funds to help the
center open. The staff inelmied a
program director, group heiids,
and nurses. The program director
is salaried at three dollars per
hour. A group of nurses will
rotate to fill the health staff re-
quiremcnt.

According to the SUNYA Co-op

Keeping ‘In Touch ’

by Bob Lent

A president's advisory coin-
mittee has recently been formed
in order “to serve as a tunneling
device for new ideas to improve
the quality of campus life and the
image of the university."

President Benezet proposed the
formation of the commit tcc at the
first general faculty meeting in
August. Selection of the commit~
tee members was intended to be
representative of every major
constituency group on campus.
The advisory committee will
function to keep the president in
touch with the thoughts of the
different university elements.
Benezet expects that the group
will “act as a referral point to
decide where new ideas and com-
plaints might be referred for
action by the appropriate gover-
nance groups."

“The committee will only serve
in an advisory capacity". said
Beneact at a recent interview. “It
will refer to governance bodies
concerns that ought to receive
attention and action and it will
not have any powers except for
relevant talk of what might con-
cern the uniVersity community.
The committee is emphatically
not to be thought of as an inter-
fence or duplication of labor
management negotiations,

 

The committee members
Judy Avoer and Tom Signore,
representing the Student Associa.
tion; Warren Haynes, Academic
Deans; Jerry Lee, EOI’; Joel True
and Donald Whitlock, State Uni
versity Professional Association;
James I’oweis, Ilai'ry llaiiiilton,
and Mary ‘irenader, I"iiculty~at~
large; Yolanda Deltoso and Daniel
G'rygas, Civil Service Employees
Association.

The first organizational meeting
of the group, held on 'I'lnirsday.
October '28, served as a “gcncral
acquaintance session". President
Benezet has cited that somc of the
probable topics for future discus-
sion might include overcrowding
at the univorsity, the appearance
of the campus, and the image of
the university in the Albany
communitv.

The President of Student Asso-
ciation, Mike Lainpert, has ex-
pressed some mixed emotions
about the committee. “The basic
idea of a president‘s advisory
committee is good, that is, to get
a point of view other than that
which is usually obtained through
the routine channels to give him
‘out of channel‘ input", “I feel
that it would be better if the
president were to get out and
listen to the views of the students
on the podium," commented
Lamport.

President Ilene/ct expressed concern over the University‘s financial
future as a result of the transportation bond issue‘s defeat. He stated
at his “('oninniiiity Forum" on Wednesday that "the public can't

Lighting is one of Indian qiiad’s
maior problems. Jenkins reports
that. there are nolights on the quad
corners, nor in the corner towards
the gym "where there have been at
least twu incidents of theft or liar-
ra meiit.” Students use this
stairway when getting off the bus
at the gym (Indian is not a sched-
uled stop). Jenkins also suggests
that different bulbs be used in the
existing fixtures which would pro-
vide much more light.

The informal atmosphere in
Indian quad’s 4+2, where people
mill and mix more, makesthis area
"an ideal set up for a rip-off," eon-
tinucs the coordinator. Jenkins
also feels that most thefts are “iii-
house" jobs, “They occur in broad
daylight and it seems the thieves
know the habits of the people they
are ripping off and can, thus, act
spontaneously when the oppor-
tunity arises," he explains. Simi-
larly, Hathaway does not “rule out
the internal folk"on Dutch.

On State, Pierce considers the
co-ed dorms more susceptible to
theft as “no matter who it is, they
aren't. questioned." The tower
there, as on Dutch and Colonial,
presents a special problem due to
the “pickahility” of suite door

Hathaway stresses the fact lllt'

that Security is hiring scvcral iii-

all is to be done.

The coordinators suggest a num-
ber of preventative measures that
students can take, besides lllt“

and "don't let in strangers."

F SA Votes To

by Tom Cliiigan

On Tuesday, October 26, thc Membership Board of
the Faculty-St udcnt Association made everyone
associated with the university n “constituent meni-
her" of II‘SA. The two rights of a“const ituent mem-
her” are an ability to attend mcctings of the Membeiu
(they meet two times a year) and llll' ability to
t-\.inuiic the hooks and records ol the (‘orporatiou

the “conslitiicnl nu-nihirrs” couldn’t votc. .\l().\l of
the members, limvevi-r. felt that llll' new position
“opcncd up" the FHA for public scrutiny.

The bill was introduced at the semi annual meeting

Another change made moved I)r. Ilene/.cl to the

The main purpose of the meet ing was the election of
