Why Voters Said

No

by Bill Stocktons.
xl/J Science ll’rilcr

Disgruntled ovur mushrooming state expenditures.
fed up with taxes and “turned off" by a saturation
iidVertising campaign- ~those Were the reasons voters
gave in a statewide opinion sampling on why Gov.
Rockefeller $2.5 billion transportation bond issue
was rejected at the polls Tuesday.

Some of the those queried about the motives
behind the bond issue‘s failure said it was merely an
extension of the taxpayer's rcvoll that has been
swr'cpiiig the country

Olbcrs said the rcjcctiriii stemmed from a basic
fear of Increased spending in light of the national
economy

And some people said flatly llicy resented the
pressure brought by state and local political leaders
who campaigned vigorously for the lioan issui-

Most of the people asked about the impact of the
bond issue's rejection were resigned to thc probabll
ity of new tam-s

“I'm sick of Rockefeller and all his spending. I
expect lii.\'cs to be incri-iiscrl. They always arc.
anyway,” said Miss Maurcccn ('ondriti of Albany.
who voted against the proposal.

“I didn't llkc the way R()(‘kl'll‘lll't‘ll‘lt'd to rain it

DDT Turkey

By G. DAVID WALLACE

Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON AP ~ The Agriculture Department is
considering a plan which would enable Swift 8: Co.
to market 50,000 turkeys tainted with DDT-like
chemicals if the merit can be made to measure up to
federal standards.

,The plan. which could save Swift by $300,000 by
government estimates, consists of cooking the chem-
icals out of the turkeys. then clearing them for use
in frchit dinners, soups and pot pies. Officials
emphasich in interviews that the meal would have
to be proven safe.

I!" adopted. the plan would be the closing chapter
in what remains the most mysterious incident yet.
involving contamination of food by a family of
industrial chemicals called polychlorinati-d bi«
phynels. or Pt'Bs The chemicals have been blamed
for skin ailments In humans and liver disease and
birth defects in test animals.

The contaminated turkeys were discovered at the
Swift Sr (7o. plant in Detroit Lakes. Minn . last
August. Officials still have not disclosed the source
of the contamination.
