CURE Business

To the Editor,

As a junior in the School of
Business, I would like to make
other students aware of the situ-
ation that exists. Over a year ago,
the CURE proposal was passed by
the University Senate. Subse-
quently, all schools and their dc-
partments were instructed to in-
corporate the proposal into their
programs

Although 1 had heard rtimors to
the contrary, l had assumed that
the School of Business had fully
complied with this directive. How-
ever, upon attempting to plan my
courses for Spring, 1972, l was
informed that the 1969-70 re-
quirements were identical to the
requirements found in the
1971-72 catalog (to be more ex-
act, the l97l-7’J. catalog had one
additional requirement).

This was not the unbelievable
part. lit a number of places in the
l969-70 catalog states that you
may trike one course or another
course, To most people this would
mean that you have a choice of
one course or a different course.
This, however, is not the School
of Business‘ interpretation Ac-
cording to the Undergraduate i\rl
visor, or means and,

The situation that exists is ab-
horrent. Students in the School of
Business are compelled to take at
least till credits of business
courses, of which only lr'i are In
their area of concentration. of the
remaining -l:'i credits, more than
28 are in required courses,

Another area of concern is that
of independent study. An iirbr
trary limit of ii credits has been
set on individual projects. This
lags behind the rest of the univer-
sity which allows up to lFi credits
for an approved project.

It is time for the studentsof the
School of Business to stop taking
the crap that is being forced upon
them. I strongly urge all business
students to confront W. Warren
Haynes, Dean of the School of
Business, and demand that the
injustices that now exist be im-
mediately rectified.

Library: Pro

To the Editor.

I have grown weary of all of the
criticism directed at the library that
has appeared in student publica-
tions (the .-lSI‘, the Graduate
Nciirslcller. and the Turner ’l‘ri
Illllli‘l since i entered graduate
studies at SUNYA last January.
Much undue criticism has been
directed at Dr, Jonathan Ashton
and his staff, criticism that might
well haVc started years ago when
Miss Alice Hastings was Director
of the SUNYA library, aiirl when
the collection and other head»
aches seemed so minor by com-
parison to today's very complex
situation,

But since the criticism comes
directed at the present situation,
let's rcvu-w the mam problems
which hamper eVeryone's use of
the library and the materials II is
supposed to house.

The library and its Director and
his staff havr- not giVi-n up, simply
or otherwise. It seems many of
the reforms Dr. Ashton has ill‘
ready made or Is contemplating
making are vital to the success of
everyone's use of the library A
rare brink room finally i-xtsts
which attempts to preserve rare
materials from mistreatment by
both librarians tcataloguers espe-
cially) and students. The new per
iodicals room in the lower level
efficiently groups all periodicril
materials together enabling one to
find materials all in one area,
rather than ambling from floor to
floor in search of vital references
Il"he proposed A-Z organization of
the stacks seems a perfectly logi-
cal and simple way to find the
books we all need.

What must change are many old
fttxl’lltilltKl ways, as has been point-
ed out. Students must stop steal-
ing materials they have no right to
own A collection is only useful
when it iippriixrmates complete
mess I would like to see the entire
collection in closed stacks or if
the collection were to remain o
pen, no books should circulate,
Then We might begin to find

order, and the books we need.
Right now we all know how easy
it is to steal materials.No effectiVe
guards are on duty after to p.m,
each night, and during the day,
anyone can any books out
through the entrance between the
periodical room and the School of
Library Science. l tested that ap-
proach just to see if it could be
done, anrl it could.

Now the books are all out of
order, and We are told enough
staff cannot be hired to even
shelve returned books. What we
can all do now while the library is
in such a pitiable state seems
simple: I We should look at the
books we think we need for our
papers, glance at the contents and
indexes, and check out only the
most vital volumes. 2. We can as
Jim Weissman suggests re-shelvc
books we have used for study in
the building itself It. And instead
of snickcriltg at fellow students
who steal books outright With
little or no intention of returning
these books, we cart make our
“friends” return stolen materials,
or offer to return these books
ourselves.

'l‘be staff at the library is only
too happy it seems to me It) offer
as much servu'r- to the student
body as is humanly possible, but
perhaps a library is only as good
as its r‘lit'litt‘lc’.‘

Where There’s
Smoke...

Via the Iditor of the ASI"

An open letter to those who
smoke marijuana in public: may l
suggest that you ask yourselves
whether your actions are an ego
trip that invites danger for others
as Well as yourselves. While dcm~
onstrating your freedom from
outdated conventional mores, you
are also demonstrating a disregard
for the law, Such actions are an
invitation to the uniformed
friends of J. Edgar Hoover, Neil
Kelleher, and Barney Fowler to
come sniffing oVer the shoulder of
every smoker on campus. I think
we can agree that this would be an
unfortunate development. May i
suggest instead that you join the
fight to change laws that attempt
to restrict the harmless behavror
of inrlivrrluals. Meanwhile, why
not join your friends in smoking
the plant species of your choice
in private"
