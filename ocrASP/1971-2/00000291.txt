Does Satisfa(story/Unsatisfactory Make the Grade ?

It’s a Basically Good Idea

Junior SteVen H, Goldstein, u
political science major feels the
Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory sys-
tem is basically good, although he
didn't know about it. when he
decided to matriculate at Albany.
“First I thought it was a good idea
if used right. There were times
when I had doubts. Before I got
into it I tliolight I might slack
off...l took physics—part (if the
requirements at the time...-
pass/fail iii physics had me oiily
worrying about getting a C."
Goldstein was asked what he
thinks thc University’s reasons
were for instituting S/U grading.
He stressed the difficulty teachers

might have in determining the
slight difl‘eri'nces between li-tter
grades, especially in the social

sciences as opposed to the natural

sciences. Goldstein thinks "that.
the Undergraduatei Academic
Council decision to grant blanket
petitions (for grades) was

right...but they should have done
it through the University Senate."

Kathy Kuclynski, a sophomore,

about S/U when she came here,
and tlioilglit it was ii good idea.
This initial reaction has changed.
“I thought it would lt‘Sst'n tension

you’re on it for too long a time
you lend to let things slide,"
Kathy pctitioncd for gradcs “part-

Editor's Note

While this presentation makes
no pretensetaf being a represen-
tative sampling of the student
body. it is hoped that the opin-
ions and statements of the
twenty students polled will give
some insight on the feelings of
students towards S/U grading.

 

 

Works

Junior Carolyn Clark was aware
that. she would be on S/U when
she applied here. and during her
first semester she was "very glad
to he on it." [\flvt‘ two years, her
opinion of H/U grading has not
cliaiigcd, bccallsc “I didn't do
Vi-i'y wrll in my fi'cshman and
sopholiiri- ycars." She says that
S/l' didn't prompt licr into taking
coiirsi-s in acadcmically unfamiliai
