SUNY ‘Women’s Caucus’
Fights for Equal Rights

by Sandra Edwards

Groucho Marx read “Ladles” on the door, went
in, and “there they were!" In 1969, while associated
with the National Organization of Women (NOW),
Ann Scott saw "Women" on the door of SUNY,
Buffalo, where she is on the faculty, Went in, and
didn't find many. Generally, those she did find felt
they were discriminated against because of their sex.
A closer look revealed that the situation at Buffalo
was reiterated throughout the SUNY complex.

The result of these findings is the Caucus on
Women’s Rights at SUNY, a chartered organization
designed to study and, ultimately, eliminate specific
discriminatory practices against women—faculty,
staff, and students—on S‘UNY campuses. Although
the Caucus is not affiliated with the national
Women's Liberation movement, it is, like NOW and
similar groups, a reflection of many of the same
interests.

Accomplishments Cited

Since its inception two-and-a-half years ago, the
statewide (from Buffalo to Stony Brook and several
in between) Caucus has held four conferences, two
on the Albany campus. The Caucus at SUNY counts
among its accomplishments the repeal of the Nepo
tism Rule last year. This permits a married couple to
be hired by SUNY, and both are given regular
appointments.

In addition to the statewide Caucus organization,
there is a chapter group on each campus. The
Albany steering committee lists as particular inter»
ests graduate residency requirements, on-campiis
(lay-care facilities, quota systems within all three
groups, and departmental courses in women studies.
They are also looking into the treatment of part-time
personnel. EVcntually, the SUNYA Caucus hopes to
form a loose coalition with other women's groups
on campus to work together toward goals they share
in common.

Solutions Supplied

To supply solutions to existing and as yet un-
covered problems, the steering committee serves as

an advisory board to which all female members of
the SUNYA community are invited to bring their
problems. The board hopes to show the Way
through bureaucratic channels (the Grievance Pro
cedures). No gripe is too bigortoosmall: they want
to know what's bugging you, be you a student,
faculty, or staff member.

SUNYA Discrimination?

Besides the above-cited projects of the Albany
Caucus, a survey was undertaken on their behalf in
1970. Subjects were faculty members in most
departments on campus. Some findings were: 12%
of all tenured faculty are women; 10 women (vs 166
men) who have joined the faculty since 1865 have
tenure; in the Division of Math and Scienc-, there
are It male assistant professors and one female; of
the 128 full professors who receive salaries bitween
$l8,000 and $22,999, nine are women; two people,
a man and a woman, perform the same function but
the man‘s assigned title reaps him $12,772 while the
woman's title earns her $9310 Although these iind
many other results do not nee irily prove discrim-
ination, they do suggest a pattern in administrative
policies.

Housing uestions

Probe Student Desires

by Don Bemont

Do you believe the number of co-educational halls
should be increased? That is one of tliirly five
questions that will be asked of all resident students
within the next ten days, rl‘he questions will appear
in a questionnaire sent out by Robert Fairbanks,
Assistant Director of Housing.

According to Fairbanks, “One goal is to find
better use of residence space based on student wants
and needs as short and long range goals." Fairbanks
also hopes to use the results as a basis for the
possible revamping of the present housing applica-
tion procedures.

Reasons for living on campus will be asked. ()iii-
question asks whether the resident student is living
on~campus because of Greek commitment, parental
pressure, lack of off~campus housing, personal prc
t'erence, or convenience.

The questionnaire will be available from members
of the staff In all residence halls. The survey is
expected to completed before the ’l'hanksgiving
recess. Fairbanks said,“We hope to get a positive
student response. Positive students response will be
determined by the number of returns."

The answers to the questionnaire may bring
changes in the coeducational facilities according to
Fairbanks. Questions ask whether more co-ed halls
should be organized, where the halls should be, and
whether freshmen should be placed in cireil
housing. Another question asks, “If you are inter
ested in co-cducational housing, which type of (‘o ed
living would you prefer?"

Other questions ask personal reactions to other
special interest balls. The results of the survr-y
should be available by early December.

Crisis 5300

Offers Alternatives

by Katie Friedlaiid

“We are working on a lot of different levels to try
to do both education and treatment." explained
Dick 'l‘ryon, director of the Middle Earth project.

“Middle Earth tits name is taken from .l.li.R,

he continued. “It incorporates (‘lilSlS Bill)” and

loneliness, pregnancy, psychological disorders.

’l‘hoiigli funded by a grant that comes to the
