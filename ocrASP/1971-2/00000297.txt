No Surprise

To the Editor;

All of those who have expressed
concern over the denial of tenure
to Dr. Goodman and others will
be interested to know that the
man who engineered his denial Iias
also engineered himself the Chair-
manship of the Department of
History, without any student
participation in his selection. In
fact, the faculty didn't have much
voice, either.

Thus the charade of democracy
goes on, with those who would
destroy all we have fought for in
two years gaining in power all the
time.

It's gone far enough. We must.
make a slaiid against the Richard
Kendalls of this world. Remember
Gerry Wagner!

A Disgusted Ilistory student

Peace Studies

To our sisters and brothers of
the University Community:

Life presents us with a lot of
conflicts and decisions to make
and at times, as students, we are
experiencing these kinds of things
at relatively lower intensities. I
know that I really wonder about
myself and my ability to compre-
hend and deal creatively and
effectively (in my own
judgement) with situations I am
going to be in.

The emerging Peace Studies
Department, which now can be
used as a secoan field, is already
beginning to blossom into a fully
accredited major field. The
emphasis of this program would
be on the problems of war and
violence, on the interiiiitioiial
level, in our nation, society,
groups, and in our individual lives.
We feel that this program must
have a base in all areas ~ from the
natural and social sciences to the
arts and humanities and most
importantly to our beliefs and
actions. We hope that Peace
Studies might be able to help our
attempts to fill the gaps made by
plaguing questions and doiibts and
uncertainties in dealing with the
conflicts we face as individuals
and as members of a world
community.

Suggestions on Courses which
are being offered next semester
and others which will be offered
in comlng semesters have been
distributed to academic advisers.
If you'd like to come and share.

Thoughts
on Kohone

To Rabbi M. Kahant- aiitl the JI)I..

Dear Sirs:

I was impressed last night by
Ralibi Kalianc's speech. I was
impressed by his frankness, and
his courage to “tell it like it is,"
the positive aspects and the nega
tive. Positive in his assertions for
dignity and self-respect, of indivr-
duals as well as soctcties, giving
living embodiment to the values
expressed in the U.N. Declaration
of Human Rights. In this respect I
think he was addressing dents and
non-Jews alike.

On the other side, Rabbi Kaliaiie
has been extremely iiegatlvc. I
understand that his speech was
not meant to be a systematic
well-rounded exposition, btit still
without being argumentatiVe and
specific, basic flaws are easily
depictable. I shall divide these
into ti number of questions, for
brevity, anti to further the impor-
tant dialogue that he's started,

(I) The basic flaw in Kahanc‘s
views is that he tried to explain a
number of political, social, and
eeoconomic problems in terms of
religion. Accordingly, issues of
justice, violence and equality were
discussed as consequences ol
Jewish and non‘Jewisli conflict,
and not as societal, applicable to
all societies including the Israeli.
Don‘t you think that this owr-all
"religious" explanation of the
complexity of the world is an
oversimplification'?

(2) Positive as Rabbi Kaliaiie's
emphasis is on the beauty of
“Jewrshtiess” - in reference to the
I‘Beauty of Blackness," he failed
to say one word of what he means
by “Jewisliness.” In my opinion,
it is not ii theological debate, and
as long as it is ignored, it will
cause tremendous confusion. For
example, Rabbi Kahane believes
that every Jew is an Israeli first,
and hence his pleii for every Jew
to go "home." 'l‘wo decades have
passed since the establishment of
Israel and the essence of this
"home" has not been defined. Is
Israel the answer to the “Jewish

problem?" Or, an additional
problem?

(3) Eloqueiitly Rabbi Kahane
compared the situation in Weimar
Germany and the US. and predic-
ted another holocaust. In no way
did he analyze cause from effect.
As long as Rabbi Kaliane and
every other Rabbi does not define
“Jewighm-ss" -religion cullure'.’
racc‘.’ political movement?
holocausts are apt to be repeated.
For example; is it the hatred and
tlitI jealousy of the non-ch that is
the cause, or is it Jewish clannislr
ness and opposition to intcul‘él'
lioli‘.’ Or is n holh'.‘ 11'. according
to Rabbi Kaliaiic, every ‘IPW I5 “”
Israeli first, can he blame
Americans for intolerance antl tlis-
criniination'.’ Are the Isl‘ilt‘ll
“black panthers" less saVage aiitl
abhorrent than those of llll'
Bronx“? If, according to Rabbi
Kaliane, (ind did not pill the Jew
in this world to become a doctor,
but to “make this world a little
better," how can r\lllt'l‘l('ilti Jews
make this world a little better if
they leave this country that needs
them, and go to a country that
doesn't? Doesn't Rabbi Kahane
know that if more Jews leave the
I,l.S., this means more displace-
ment of Palestinians and more
expansion and more war'.’ Are the
Palestinian Arabs to pay the price
of Western anti-semilisni'.’ How
can someone like Rabbi Kalianc,
so aware and conscious of injus-
tice and humiliation accept the
genocide of a whole people?

(5) Rabbi Kahane, “religious” as
lie was in his  rtions and ra-
tionalizatioiis, failed to communi-
cate to many Jews and non-Jews
alike, why it is impossible to live
antl practice the Jewish values of
love, brotherhood and justice, in
the Bronx or Albany or
Acapulco? ls Judaism a uiiivr-rsal
faith, or a chauvinistic faith in a
small piece of land?

(6) Finally, how can an activist
nioralist like Rabbi Kaliane
explain the painful Israeli--
Palestinian conflict in terms of
“gambling.” The Palestinians
according to him gambled on par‘
tition and lost. “That is it."
Doesn‘t this “gambling game"
remind him of the story of the
two women who came. to King
Solomon, each claiming the same
child‘.’ Well, not knowing to whom
the child belonged King Solomon
suggested that the child be “piirti~
tioned" - divided into two halves.
What happened? The. “fake”
mother easily accepted arbitra-
tion, while the real mother
screamed mid begged Solomon to
spare the life of the child. It
wasn't a gambling game, but it
was life. Does Rabbi Kahane still
remember his tradition or had he
started reading another "book?"

On Representation

As recorded in last Friday‘s ASP, a twelve-member
“intended to be representative ofcvcry

advisory committee " .
pus has bccn appointed.

.major constituency group on cam ' '
The committce is desrgncd to increase the presidents

communication with our diverse university community. The
committee is to be a new avenue of communication, a
supplement to the communication lines that are suppost
to exist thwccti Dr. Bcnczct and our campus governing
bodies. . ' . .
Clearly, Dr. Benczct tools that C(lliililtllllflttittili wrrh
university governing bodies is not enough. He s absolutely
correct. There are many students. I'aculty members. and
others whose opinions are not adequately reprcsciircd.

As the head of a large bureaucracy, Dr. Itciiczct‘s range of

communication is limited. naturally. The president has very
little free time and thus has to carefully choose the Purple
he meets with. Asa responsible leader, the president lt't'ls Ilt'
must meet with I'l'III'l‘.\'('IIftlffl't' people.

But who arc representative people? l_)I'. Bent-let has,
apparently. defined the university community in terms of a
tWL'IVC'lllclliI‘lt‘l‘ Committee. There are three students on [Ilt'
committee, but that is it as far as new .rtiti/r'ni fll/lltl is
concerned. All Dr. licnczct has done is to find three more
students to talk to: he has not found a rt'lirt'st‘iitatii'c
cross-section of our student body. The committee will not
be an effectch medium through which the president will be
able to hear from “different univcrsit) elements." IIt' will
instead hear from twclvc individuals.

It I)l. ISL-iicxct wants a committee to study t.llll|)ll\
problems and suggest solutions. tlicn Ilt' can better turn to
one of tIlt' governing bodies that currently t‘\l\l. II In-

Bookstore and IRS

Buffalo, NY (CPS)—The Internal Revenue Service ruled last week
that the University Bookstore at SUNY-Buffalo must begin granting
refunds on certain books sold recently at prices in violation of the

federal wage-price freeze.

This decision came as a result of action instituted by David
Steinwald, Student Right co-ordinator, shortly after school resumed

in September.

Mr. Steinwald's contention at that time was that some books were
being sold for more than was charged last semester. Thomas Moore,
manager of the Bookstore, acceded that this was true. He explained,
however, that prices had been raised to correspond with similar price
hikes by the publisher which were instituted before the freeze went
into effect. Since the texts did not go on sale until September, after
the August 15 deadline, Mr. Moore then stated that the Bookstore was
faced with the choice of either raising prices to compensate for the
higher cost, or “losing a substantial amount of money."

While economics won out initially, purchasers of illegally priced
books are now due retribution. "Basically, they [the IRS] are not
granting exceptions to anyone, even in the event it would cause
bankruptcy," said Mr. Moore. He added that he was not, of course,
implying that the Bookstore would go bankrupt.

NADER AFTER MIMRESS’

Consumer crusader Ralph Nader
announced this week that he is
turning a team of at least 80
Nader's Raiders loose on the
United States Congress.

Nader said his Washington, DC.
task force will compile a “massiVe,
year-long study" on congressmen
campaign procedures, the power
of the eXecutive branch over
representatives and the manner in
which Congressional decisions
“are really made."

Nader's office toltl Earth News
that the Congressional investiga-
tion was launched last summer
and that the filial report will not
be completed until the fall of
1972. The investigation will in-
voIVe at least. 80 professionals who
will study all aspects of Congress
in Washington, DC; aiirl it will
enlist at least one volunteer in
each of the 435 Congressional

districts across the nation. The
local volunteers will collect iri-
formation on the practices of coir
gressmeii in their home districts.

The National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) is presently

Army Gets Stag

Colonel Anthony Herbert did not appear on the
Dick Cavett show Tuesday night because the Army
didn’t want him to go on.

Herbert appeared on the Cavett show in Septem-
ber and the mail received from the show was the
largest response any guest had ever generated on the
nationally televised program.

The highly decorated veteran of three wars was
scheduled to appear again Tuesday night but three
days before the schedule appearance the com-
mander of Herbert's base, F't. McPherson, near
Atlanta, revoked Herbert’s leave when it was found
that he planned to appearagainon Cavett’s show.

Last time Herbert was on the show he talked
about the war crimes he had witnessed and how
they were ignored by his commanders.

Charles Morgan, An ACLU attorney in Atlanta
who is advising Herbert of his legal rights, said that
the commander first revoked Herbert‘s leave alto-
gether. Herbert then applied for an 18 day leave and
that was turned down. Then a four day leave was
requested by Herbert and that. was refused. Finally
Herbert asked for a one day leave rind that was
turned down, then granted then turned down then
granted, Morgan said. When finally granted, hows

efrlg" ht ' ‘
ever, it was five minutes to a nlme and Herbert had

no chance of getting to the studio.

During the three days while the hassling over a
leave was going on, Morgan said Herbert was being
treated like a private on the baserwas required to
salute senior officers, an act: not usually required of
senior officers. Herbert according to Morgan, was
also put through drills, taught how to stand at
attention and other seemingly meaningless chores.

Morgan said Herbert has written orders from the
base commander which specifically say he cannot
talk with anyone associated with the news media.
Though Herbert was standing in the same room with
Morgan, Earth News was not allowed to talk to the
colonel or even to relay questions and answers
through his attorney.

Morgan said Herbert wants to talk to the media
and especially wants to go on the Cavett show but
there are no indications that the Army is ready to
recind its orders.

The Army has not filed any charges against
Colonel Herbert, though he was scheduled to be
"pushed" out of the service in February.

A Presidential promotion order Tuesday, however,
may keep him in.
