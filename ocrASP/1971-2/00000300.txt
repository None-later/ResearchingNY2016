Pla ttsburgh

by Bruce Mnggin

0n a brisk windy autumn after-
noon, in perfect football weather,
the Albany Great Danes pro-
ceeded to ruin it for themselves,
by losing 7-6 to Pluttsburgh State.

It was the inability of the Danes
to stop Plattsburgh’s passing
attack as quarterback Larry Cnr-
penter completed 8 of 12 uerials
for 108 yards. The Dunes however
could not muster a pass attack as

71",?“

Bill Flanagan was only 2 for 7 and
did not complete II pass in the
second half. Flanagan obviously
missed star wide receiver Ed
Williams who was out with an
injury.

The Dunes opened up the game
with the expected wishbone-T
running formation, but they could
not capitalize on a Cardinal fum-
ble us they gave the bull right back
to Plattsburnh on their own fum-

Bernie Boggs. star tailback and leading ground giIint-r of the
(irI-at Dillll‘ Football club, was injured in Saturday's 7-6 loss to
I’lzittsburgh State. On a kickoff in the second quarter Boggs was
buried underneath II largo pili-up and badly sprained his neck. The
hospital, to which he was taken immediately, rcleascd him that
day. Coach Ford said that he will have to see how chI he has
I‘l‘L'OVt‘I‘t‘d before saying whether he will play or not. Other
members of lhc DIIIic backfield are hurt too and the whole
starting backfield looks doubtful. (iri-g Finki-II is II possible

ble. The sloppy pluy continued as
Arnie Will of Albany intercepted a
pass and returned it to the Albany
27—yard line. The Danes now
started a drive that ended in their
only score of the game.

Bernie Boggs broke through the
line of scrimmage, after it
appeared that he was stopped, and
scampcred 20 yeiIrds. Greg Finkcll
ran for eight and Carvin Payne for
seven as the quarter ended. In the
second period the Danes changed
their direction, but continued to
march. (in a key third down and

plays later the Cardinals scored
and made the extrn. point. This
single point was enough to give
Pliittsburgh an upset victory.

Early in the fourth quarter,
Flanagan, with the wind at his
back, had to go to the air but was
intercepted. Later on, the Danes
were presented with what proved
to be their final chance of the

   

day. A penalty put the Danes in
good field condition. On a third
down and four, Plnttsburgh re-
covered an Albany fumble. They
drove all the way down to the
two-yard line before giving up the
football with four seconds left.
Flanagan tried a desperation pass
but it was intercepted to end the
football game.
