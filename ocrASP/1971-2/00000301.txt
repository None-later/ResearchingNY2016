Dr. Reginald E. Gilliam of the
Afro-American Studies Depart-
ment to a series of questions
posed by ASP reporter Al
Thompson. An additional article
on the post-Albany State oppor-
tunities for Black students will
appear in Friday’s newspaper:

Would you encourage Black stu-
dent to go to all-Black schools?

Now. speaking personally, let's
say between me and a son of
mine, I would, if 1 had the re-
sources for such a choice, prefer
that he did his undergraduate
work at a predominantly Bison
school. Now you know I‘m not
speaking in any vacuum here, the
Lincoln, Fisk, Howard, More-
house experience has been an in-
tegral part of my life—I have seen
the vitality. warmth, real brother-
hood. healthy social life patterns
at these schools and I would want
them for my son-l wouldn‘t want
him to be forced through the
trauma of “Identity crisis" and all
of these other transitory hang-ups
that are so much a part of the
Black experience at White schools.
I also know that the educational
quality in those particular iii-
situtions meets or exceeds that of
most White institutions.

Now for graduate school or
technical training, I must insist
that he go to the (test whiti-
institution possible. You cannot.
deny the fact that white. Ameri
can graduate schools are among
the best in the worldmwe should
certainly opt for obtaining skills
from them. much like our African
brothers.

’l'ranscr‘.’ No. It is not at all
practical to disrupt om-‘s patterns
by starting out at one place aiiil
going someplace else before com‘
pleting the four years. It WU'll(l do
more harm than good.

 

Outlined

What role does the Block college
graduate play in relationship to
realistic careers and opportunities?

As 1 indicated. Black people as a
whole. must re-orient our priori-
ties. This applies to careers. Any
concept of “nation” involves hav-
ing a whole range of special skills.
The fact that initial employment
and involvement might of necessity
have to be in the white sector is
not a problem if that resource
(skill) is still available to Iis. The
vital thing is that that skill be
viable in the sense of it being able
to contribute to our development.

What course of study would you
advise a Black or minority student
to take?

Black youth must begin to
choose courses of study that are
applicable to, related to, or bear
on the grave problems faced by
the Black population. We must
have skills. we niusl have technical
expertise, we must have practi-
tioners and doers. Some people
hear this and say to me “you‘.e
limiting Blacks," 'l‘hat's nonsensal

that. then you can speak In terms

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

This is one of my greatest wor-
ries. I see our finest minds at
schools across the nation only
being actively, vigorously sought
and recruited by programs and
projects that are proven failures:
for example, so-called anti-
poverty programs, or externally
created “for Blacks" slots that
“deal with" other Blacks on
meaningless levels. This is why
some of us must begin to pool
resources so that we can create
vital institutions of our own to
put ourselves to meaningful work.
And. I have. heard constantly, all
of the negative “you can't do it"
comments from the cliique of
"experts on Negroes." At one
time, I believed this, as they
wanted me to. Now that I havv
grown and matured, I know that
what they told me w a lie. l‘ve
travelled across Mis ippi, Ala-
bama, Louisiana, Arkansas and
more mid have seen things that
would make your eyes rise in
terms of what Blacks are capable
of. But. here, in the North. we are
told that all we can create are gift
shops and Black films. I prefer to
think more in Garvey and Islamic
terms of substantial institutional
growth. The ignorant call this
"separatist," I suppose, btit ifyou
consider that Black folks in the
US. are still basically separated
from the society'then this is only
a program that deals with what is,
I don't think we have time for
silly debates over silly labels.

Well, I think that our way of
looking at the South is what has
l'i‘tlll_\‘ changed. For a long time.
we \vcri- led to l)t‘llt'VI' that thc
