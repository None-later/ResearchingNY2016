New Peace Studies Program

Seeks Non-Violent Solutions

by Elizabeth Taylor

Peace Studies, an interde-
partmental program to be offered
to SUNYA students this spring,
has been set up to study inter-
national relations and other re-
lated topics. It hopes to find
non-violent solutions to the pro-
blems of war. social change and
conflict.

The Peace Studies program
hopes to heighten the-students
awareness of the problems around
them. By giving the students a
sense of continually working to-
gether. and by enabling them to
redirect their energy into non-
violent channels. the program is
directed towards decreasing per-
sonal violence. Attempts will be
made to break down the barriers
between people caused by role
playing. Hopefully by sharing ideas
and experiences people will be-
come more reccplivc to each
other and. therefore, less capablc
of Crcating violcnt acts.

The new program came about in
response to the spring strike of
1971). Strulcnts arid faculty
riir-nibcrs ntct to try to find noti-
virilr-nt paths of changc. I"roni this
rcspUIN' iirosr- lllt' t'onflict Ilcso-
lution l“!)l'lIIII and thc Nori-
violr-ncr- Workshop, wlirch were
ol'fr-rr-d to students last ycar'. 'l'lic
gi‘cat rcspiiitsc to [Iii-si- programs
and lllt' faculty‘s own intr-rr-sts

prompted them to create Peace
Studies, which brings many re-
lated courses together into a
Second Field Program.

As ofnow, the program planners
do not really know what direction
it will take. New courses are being
added. and professors have volun-
teered to help with projects and

independent study.

The program hopes to give
students a different perspective on
their personal problems, and the
world's problems, and to develop
an awareness and understanding
so that they can find nonviolent
solutions to these problems.

A grorip of Jeriiakoff's students
and former students have initiatcd
a campaign to “save” llt't'. They
argue that shc is a fine tcachcr,
atirl not casin rcplaccablc. Shane
acknowledged, “The students
have presented, ind no mic is dis-
puting this, thal Jcrnakoff is an
excellent teacher. I have no dis~
agreement with this. From all
sources. I have heard that site 1
good tcachcr.” IIchvr-r, hc dis-
agri-i-d with a widely held view
that I’Ii.l)'s often do not make the
best teachers. Ilc said. “I’ve seen
sonic cxchIr-nt teachers of so-
callcd scholars." llc addcd that
thcrc are many people with B.A.'S
and i\'I,A,'s who are interested in
teaching, yet are poor tcachcrs.
Shane underlined thr- importance
of scholars in an institrrtion such
as Albany State. He aid that
creating a staff with research and
scholarly potential ultimately
improves its teaching.

  

 

Jcrnakol'f agreed that PILD’s
have a large role to play in a
university lltht‘Vt'I‘, she is not in
accord \vith Shane's assessment of
scholars. "I think that Very often
a person with a I'h.D a scholar
shall we .1_'. Is not iii-c arin the
best teacher " Jcriialrofl' believes
that a feel for teaching cannot be

pro I'cssor,

'I'hririgh disappointed. .Icrnakoff
insists that she is riot bitter. "I
have to accept the decision, I‘m
wrlliiig to accept the decision. I
have no recourse." She is Very
gratified llial her students think
so highly other.

While rcitcratilig that thc (Ie~
cision for the spring semester is
irreversible, Shane said. "I didn't
say that I wouldn't hire Mrs.
.leriiakol'f. If things could work
out, I would like to try aiiil swing
il l for the fall sciiicstci'l."

.Icrnakot'f has no immediate
plans “I haven't really looked
around at all. I want to finish this
semester the way I think It should
be done. It takes a lot of time "
