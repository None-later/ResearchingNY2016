ll Pot and the AMA

A new study of marijuana smokers by two Seattle doctors has
apparently convinced the American Medical Association (AMA) that
grass smokers don’t liiecessarily graduate to heroin.

The report, which will be released today in the AMA Journal, says
that in a survey of 106 “experienced male marijuana users, oiin six
percent reported experimenting with heroin or morphine once or
twice."

Twenty-seven percent. said they ltad smoked opium—generally ten
times or less, but nearly three quarters of the 106 smokers said they
had taken psychedelic drugs, either LSD or mesealine

The two doctors, Albert S. Carlin and Robin I). Post, said they
found the smokers through art ad placed in a college newspaper. The
average age was 2t?) years anti the majority of the smokers were
sttldenls.

'l'he, stttdy compares to a similar lSltiG-(ST study which shoWetl that
more marijuana smokers then were experimenting with heroin than
were takiitg hallucinogenics,

The researchers said, “one of the greatest fears of marijuana
that of graduation to addicting narcotic drugs, has not materiali'led."

The researchers reported that lierotii still has the status (if a
“dangerous drug" within the drug ctiltttre.

police investigation, “but there is not evidence that the drugs are
either being used or sold inside city school buildings."

the young persons were hardcore addicts, while others \Vere using the
narcotic in a highly diluted form.

IRS Takes True/r 

The Internal Revenue Service will be auctioning off Charles
Hastings‘ pickth truck this Friday in Seattle. Hastings did not piiy the
federal tax attached to his phone bill for H months and the [RS has
tlecided that the only way to get the $1 7.:l‘t which is owed them is to
sell his truck, which is worth about $1400.

Hastings, an Air Force veteran and college student is a member of
the War ’l‘ax Resistance-Nortliwest; a group of people who feel that
the federal tax on their plume hills, a tax which is used directly by the,
Defense Department, is unjust, unfair anrl unconstitutional. i

SeVeral Weeks ago the IRS came to Hastings' door and asked him for
the $|7.vl-l, “i can‘t in good conscience give you the money,"
Hastings told the agents. The agents had his triiek towed away and
Friday they will auction it off for the $l7.tt~l, towitig and storage
charges. Hastings will be given any money the truck sale brings
beyond wlial he owes the IRS,

The tax group plans to be at the auction Friday morning with
borrowed, saVed and begged money to buy back lltistiiig‘s truck.

The Chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, Con-
gressman George Mahon of Texas,
has offered a suggestion which
will probably not be applauded
either by his fellow legislators or
by President. Nixon,

Congressman Mahon is suggest-
ing that the President. Senators
and Representatives all take im-
mediate pay cuts to help in the
war against inflation.

('ongrcssnian Mahon pointed
out that President Nixon, the iii-
(liridnal who personally instituted
the wage frr 1., had his own
salary increased by ltltl percent
shortly after he took office And
at the same time. congressmen
atid senators volt-d tliciiiscli‘cs a
hefty l2 percent pay iiicrc. ’ .

Mahon admitted that his stig-
gestion was not being greeted with
a great deal of enthusiasm
throughout the corridors of tlie

'l'ony Russo, one of the major Witnesses in the Pentagon Papers case,
told Earth News he will return to Terminal island prison in Los
Angeles rather than he forced to testify in front of a secret federal
grand jury.

Russo, who spent more than a month in the federal penitentiary
recently. is currently awaiting a key legal decision from Los Angeles
federal Judge Warren Ferguson. Judge Ferguson is deliberating
whether or not Russo will be provided with an official transcript of
his testimony when he appears in front of the secret grand jury. Russo
has .tiid he will talk to the jury-end will answer questions—if he is
provided with an official trans 'ipt of the questioning which he can
then make public. Said Russo: "if they won't give me a
transcript then l won't talk." He insists that the government's policy
of invr-stigating the case “in secret, behind locked doors, with no
attorne . )rescnt" is alien to the American system of justice.

Russo said he was beaten by guards on one occasion while being
held in solitary confinement. at ’l‘erminal lslaiid Prison in early
September. He said the incident occurred when one federal officer—
known around the prison as “The Lieutenant"--uttempted to take
'Russo‘s personal legal notes from him. Russo reports that “The
Lieutenant" and another guaid began to kick and beat him, and
finally slammed him back against a cement wall when he refused to
yield the notes, He added: “'l‘he only thing that stopped them was
initiates on a tier above who were getting ready to gang up and come
down and help me."

Russo, a personal friend of Daniel Ellsberg's insisted that he is as
“prepared as one can possibly be" to go back to Terminal island if
necessary. Said Russo: “if the choice is between testifying iii secret
and going back to that hell hole I'm going back to the hell hole."
