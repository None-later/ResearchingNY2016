ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

by Harvey Sobel

With the month of November rolling in, iill comic
book freaks should be making plans to attend
CREATION971, the comic art convention held
November 27th and 28th at Manhattan’s New
Yorker Hotel (34th Street and 8th Avenue). Sixty
dealer tables and attending professionals such as
Frank Frazettn and Al Williamson are just some of
the treiits this con holds in store. Admission is $1.50
per day or $2.50 for both days, and any further
information can be obtained by writing Chairman
Adam Mulin at 16 E. 2nd Street in Fret-port. New
York 11620.

torrid of formulated plots. Not to say either that
DC is so far superior, but in the eyes of the author,
National, for whatever(financial) reasons, is turn-

THE AVENGERS 96

Wanna watch a space war? Well, then this issue's
for you. Number 96 is the eighth part of this nine
issue saga, and clearly it’s the Avengers at their
best... just the right amount of characterization
mixed in with the action. And speaking of action,
Neill Adams draws some of the most fantastic outer
space battles ever. The artwork brings out the best
in 'l‘homas' script, which is another point of
consideration. lo a nine issue late, one can imagine
the number of loose ends dangling about towards
the end, just waiting to be cleared up. Roy Thomas
does just that in “THE ANDROMEDA SWARML"
and even with it seven issue background, 1 still had
trouble keeping my scorecard straight. If yiiii'vn
been following this Kree-Skrull battle for earth,
then number ﬁlli is a logical continuation of an
t‘pll‘dlbl‘ struggle. The only thing 1 can say for the
neivlyeiiiernig reader is that this issue icill give you
the feeling of being dwarfed by ii cataclysmic war
bigger than any individual And in the comics media
“'l‘t‘rl‘ lhlS hilsn'l been done right too often. that‘s a
plus.

GREEN LANTERN 87

When 1 had heard that Green Lantern and Green
Arrow were having separate adventures with number
$7. 1 was against it. Not any more! In their solo
stories, both Green Lantern mid Green Arrow are
utilized to their fullest. While tliere've been a
number of Negro superheroes introduced ovur the
past few years. the new black Green Lantern which
premieres in“BEWARE MY POWER" outclasses all
other tBlack Panther and the Falcon included).
John G. L. Stewart, chip on his shoulder and all, is a
real person. not some made-up, comic book charac-
ter. When Hal Jordan power rings a uniform for
Stewart, the new Green Lantern flings off his mask.
“1 won't wear any musk!" he declares, “This black
man lets it till hang outl'” Later on, Stewart acts
irresponsibly, letting a racist senator get sprayed
with oil. Clearly, writer Denny O‘Neil did not create
a soecalled white, black man [a la television's Julia).
Stewart, as well as llal, transcends the two-dimen-
sional comics media in being lrue-to-life.

Similarly wel|«de|ineatcd is Green Arrow in

that this will most likely be the last all-new issue of (lli'lu‘laXV LANTERN
because, as it looked last. week. Neal Adams would not make the
deadline, Furthermore, because of mediocre sales and Adams-deadline
problems, the book will probably be dropped after number 88. It's
really unfortunate, though, that, whatever the reasons, such a
we|l~written and well-drawn series could not last. I'm hoping that
Mark is wrong, but 1 doubt it, Now, if enough people would only

always been best for its nice character development. (iene (Tolan and
Syd Shores return on this one for the(fine) arts chores. In addition,
Gerry Conway finally ties up that horrible Assassin storyline, which
has been crudding up the past few issues. I particularly enjoyed
Conway's mature handling of the [)aredevifBlack-Widow relationship
(especially in the tliird-to‘last panel) and am looking forward to seeing
how he develops it in the future,
