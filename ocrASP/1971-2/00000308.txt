Pioneer stereo from 

In between recording sessroris and concerts, you'll think Blood,
Sweat 8i Tears might want to take a vacation from music. Far
from it. That's when they catch tip on their listening. And that's
how we liappeiined to catch Lew Sololl, Steve Kan, and Bobby
Colomby at Bobby's place listening to current releases by their
favorite artists, on Bobby’s Pioneer stereo system.

As prolussronal musrcrans, they in5ist on lull natural sound.
When they play back their favorite records, they want to make
certain that the sound thut's recorded is the sound they hear.
That's why each of them has his own stereo system built around
Pioneer high fidelity components excluswely.

You don‘t have to be a prolessroniil musrciiiri to appreciate
gruat sound. And you don't have to settle for half way sound
