ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

It is a grand year in the history of E.O.P. The investment and
commitment that was made four years ago to provide disadvantaged
youth who were culturally or economically deprived an equal
education has finally come liotiie to harvest.

This year marks the graduation of the first E.O.P. class who, through
much turmoil. rhetoric, and experimental stages, still survived.

Some of these seniors were asked to comment on their plans for the

future. Here are their replies.

THE FSA STORY (Port Five):

State University of New York at Albany

The chart to the right shows FSA at a glance. It
lists the major program items over the past two
years and the amount of money made or lost by
each. Note the food service figure—a near quarter
million dollar drop. At the same time, bookstore
losses tripled and income from vending fell slightly.
Only vending made money last year—and it is

operating illegally.

If you are an undergraduate
student. here at Albany State. and
you think you arebeingmistreated
by the all~inclusive corporation
that is Faculty-Student Associa-
tion. you are correct in your
analysis.

If you‘re an undergraduate stu-
dent living on one of the five
quadrangles, you have even more
of a reason to complain. because
you are forced to deal with the
FSA corporate monopoly throuin
its food service operation.

As everyone knows, you can't
live in adormitory at SUNY-
Albany without taking a food
service meal.

And as everyone knows. Robert
Cooley. director of the corpora-
tioii, wants to raise the price of
that meal.

It seems a fair request when
placed In the context of thc gener-
al inflation of the times.

But you'd change your

But the profit iii-VI-r went back

Instead. it was used to defray

meals for resident staff. liit.ei‘iia~
tional Students. Mohawk and
Dippikill. and “Special University
Functions." which covers every
thing from faculty recruitment
and receptions. to administratiVe
“slucli funds."

It was a situation that was un-
ethical. if not. outright illegal. The
undergraduate students on the
FSA membership hoard recog-
nixed this fact last year. and under
the leadership of Student, Associa-
lion President David Neufcld and
Vice-President Lampert. moved to
correct it.

For the most part, they were
successful. A Committee roii l"i~
nancial Affair..- was formed to
deal Willi the entire issue. It con-
cluded that: “each of the self
supporting (FSA) operations
should stand on its own.‘

THE CAMPUS CENTER

The FSA audit shows the (‘ani-
pits Center losing a massive ar
mount if money $21....21ln it)
last year.

Robert (‘oolcy told the last FSA
membership meeting tlia . “'l‘lie
(‘aiiipus (Tciitcr has lost money
since the day we opened it."an(l
that the (Tal‘cteria is responsible
for most of the loss. That is no

It is an interesting comment
lll't’ttlls“ a report issued by New
York State ('oiitroller Arthur
Iii-vut about a year aaiid a half
ago. contradicts it. The state audi-
tiiis aid:

“The (‘aiiipus Center fat'eteria
is similar to the Quadrangle cafe-
terias which have been operated
profitably. and it would be rea-
sonable to assume that the Cam-
pus Center Cafeteria should also
produce favorable results."

“If this is the case. their Illt’
losses are lllt' result of [he I’iill'tioii
Room and Special Functions- "’

But ttiat. s not what Cooley told
the board. And it's not. what. some
FSA employees have told these
reporters.

The employees call the Patroon
Room “the white elephant of the
‘rainpus Center" and “a faculty
dining club."

This discrepency has, of course,
cast some suspicion on the accura-
cy of the official audit.

Food service personnel contend
that “there are many extra ex-
penses shipped against. the (‘ranipus
Center that management doesn't
know about.“

These reportedly include addi
lioiial costs in the payroll charged
against the (Tanipus (lentI-r food
operation which might actually be
(laiiipus (‘eiiter littildiiig cost or
padding of the supervisory pay-
roll.

Significantly, Ronald
newlyappointed head of the en
tire (‘aiiiptis (‘eiitei' food opera-
tion told these reporters: “If we
closed the (‘aiiipus t'enII-i' food
operation down. We still won't
iiiake up the quarter of a millmn

To put it way, when
you eliminate all direct and null
rect deficit remains
that cannot be accounted for.

There is additional
faulty figuring.

mate made by food si-rvn-e offi
citils. the l’atrooii Room must

Yet Robert Cooley [Old lllt'

that. the Patrooii Room breaks
even.

And last week. Food Service
Director Malcolm Corbiey ordered
all dinner operations to cease.
hardly an action to take if the
Patroon Room is indeed not los-
ing money.

Vice President John Hartley, re-
sponsible for the day to day oper-
ations of the corporation.
counter-nianded that order. Cllllm'
ing that not enough notice was
given customers and staff, and
that only the Board of Directors
can order an operation shut.

So the Patroon Room is now
opened at night, still losing mon-

said earlier this year: "FSA can-

Another time he said: “Ha tiiiit

Mr. Cooli-v also fails to mention
that this "service," which the res-
ideiit students are underwriting ii;
graciously extended to both the
faculty and iidiiiiiustrtitioii.

In short: “No one serviec~tlie
student dining halls, for example-
should be burdened with carrying
out the other operations of the
FSA program."

Some of the programs were
phased out; others were re
evaluated.

But all of this reform, it turned
out. really begged the question.
Undergraduate students no longer
haVe to worry about what hap-
pens to FSA profits. There aren‘t.
any profits to worry about.

The corporation is, in fact. insol-
vent. According to its own finan-
cial audit:

The bookstore lost $205.000.

Housing lost $13,700.

Auxiliary services lost $30,000.
(These include the barber shop.
bowling alley, beauty salon, etc.)

And food service? It lost
$17,054. a near quarter of a mil-
lion dollar turnaround in one
year.

The only aspect of the FSA
program that made any significant
money. in fact was the vending
machine operation. The vending
machines. as was showed in a past
article of this series, are being
operated illegally under present
state law.

The final tally shows FSA as
being $338,487.39 in the red.

FOOD SERVICE

This article of the FSA series
will deal mainly willi food service
operations. It is in this area that
students have the greatest contact
with the corporation that “serves”
them. and it is here tluit the
abuses of FSA are most blatant.

Earliir this fall. we met with
FSA Director Robert Cooley who
informed us that he was support
ing a board increase the following
January to compensate for losses
in the food service program. He
told the October 20. I971 meet-
ing of the Board of Directors that
“For the second seiiiestei', a con-
tract price of $750.00 for ‘20
met . iiis been assumed." (This
information is contained as ptirt
of the minutes of that meeting.)

This figure is it one hundred
dolltir increase over the present
rate; about a 15 per cent boost.
