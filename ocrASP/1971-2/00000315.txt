when the facts are
basically alike. It also allows all
defendants to present their cases,
retains fairness to all parties, and
retains the context of the
incident within which the alleged
infraction(s) took plac e. See
Section IVA, Ik for additional
information.

Group hearings by no means
predispose the hearing board to
render the same judgment for
each defendant. Each shall be
judged on the facts of his/her
particiaption in the incident. and
not by the actions of others who
were involved.

In the case where one or more
of the defendant requests a
private hearing while the othere
desire a public hearing, the public
would only be excluded during
the testimony or cross—examina-
tion of those requesting the
private hearing. (See Section IVA,
Ik and Section IV. BS).

5. Non—appearance

Section lld requires that all
parties. iriclding the accused,
must appear before a hearing
board when summoned, or give
reasonable cause for their
absense. The appearance of the
defendant at the hearing in which
he is accused, however, is not
necessary in order for the
proceedings to be fair and in
keeping with due process. The
only necessary condition for a
fair hearing is the opportunity to
be heard. This implies that the
ppersontsl rrivolved must be
informed of the charges and the
possible consequences and has
been given the opportunity to
attend a hearing.

Non»appearancc of the
defendant should never be catised

by the establishrricrit of an
inconvenient hearing calendar.
Alternative dates should he

available. If, wrthin reason, the
defendant has been given Viable
alternatives to the date of his
hearing, and there is still no
mutually agreediupon time and
date. the hearing board may
proceed to fix the date of the
hearing. A three ~working day
advance notification to the
defendant should be issued, along
with a statement that the hearing
will proceed whether or not the
defendant is present.
Non—appearance does not mean
that the appropriate procedures
need not be followed in hearing
evidence, weighing facts, anti
rendering judgment. In addition,
the non appearance ol’oric party
does not prevent the appearance
of any other iridivtdual associated
with the case. Nori appearance
(except in violation oi Section
lld) shall not be considered as a

valid justification tor the
imposition of dihclplllltll)
penalties

Under the conditions or
non—appearance, the defendant
does not admit guilt. nor does he
waive Ius rights to due process
He simply irriplies by his absence
and his negatch answer it. rio-

6. The Right of Appeal

a. Both defendant and
complainant have the right to
appeal the decision of a hearing
body.

b. An appeal of the decision of
the hearing board must be
submitted to the appeal board
within seven calendar days of
receipt of the decision of the
hearing board. This appeal must
be in writing.

c. An appeal, when accepted by
the appeal board, must be based
upon one of the following issues:

1) Questions of procedure at
the hearing which involve due
process

2) Was the evidence sufﬁciently
strong to justify a decision?

3. Was the sanction imposed in
keeping with the gravity of the
wrongdoing?

4) Appearance of substantive
new evidence related to the case,

d. The appeal board may accept
the original decision of the
hearing board, may reverse the
hearing board’s decsion and
return the case to that board for a
further hearing, may reverse the
hearing board’s decison and
dismiss the case, or may reduce
the sanctions imposed. They may
not, however. increase the
sanctions imposed.

If the appeal board accepts the
decision of the hearing hoard the
matter is deemed final, except
that either party may petition the
president of the tiriiversily for a
new hearing. In cases where the
president grants the petition fora
new hearingI he may conduct the
hearing himself or designate the
individualts) who will hear the
case. The accuse. additionally, has
the right to petition the original
hearing board to reopen the case
upon discovery of new eiidence.
The hearing board will judge the
sufficiency for the new evidence,
and no appeal can be taken for its
decision.

Norriially the appeal board

reviews the written record from
the hearing board in determining
whether to accept the request for
an appeal. or in actually hearing
an appeal. However. the appeal
board may ask for an oral
