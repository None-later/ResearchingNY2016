Booters Finish Dismal Season; HOOPStel‘S *0 Start
Dumped 6-3 by New Paltz

by Bruce Maggin

The Albany Great. Dane Soccer
team concluded a disastrous soc
cer season last Saturday, as they
lost to New Paltz 6-3.

The Danes showed some sus-
tained offense for the first time in
II while. This was only the second
time this season Albany scored
three or more goals. For Albany,
Carlos Alvarez scored twice, fin-
ishing the season with five goals,
and George Keleshian scored
once. New T’altz’s ti goals were.
scored by six different players as
they tallied four times in the first
half, This game left Albany with a
record of l-fi in SUNY conference
play.

The Hooters finished the .
with an overall I cord of 2-5). This
set an Albany record of most
losses in one season surpassing last
year’s record eight losses

The Danes record ow-r the last
decade is a measly :tti-fiti, With
only one winning season. ()ne of
the reasons for this mediocrity is
Albany's lack of recruiting. Al-
bany awards no scholarships to
soccer players and all the players
must meet the academic standards
of the university. (foacb Bill
Schieffelin said that he lost a few
boys who could have played with
the soccer team but they could
not meet the academic require-
ment to be accepted. In order to
improve the soccer team, the
coaching staff must convnice
quality soccer players to eonu- Io

players from the Junior Varsity
must be found to play with the

next year.

The major problem that must be
corrected for next season is Al»
buny's lack of offense. The Danes
scored a meager trl goals this
season and were shutout 3 times.
The opposition scored 32 goals.

West Point Cadets by a score of

Albany seems to play too conser-
vative. Perhaps a more wide open
style of play would greatly aid
Albany's meek offense. It is

hoped that the 3 goals last Satur-
day was a start for more offensive
punch next year. For Coach
Schieffelin, he has a great deal of
work to do to build the soccer
team into a contender.

Rebuilding Season

by Bill Heller

The biggest question facing
Basketball coach Dr. Richard
Sauers, is, “ Jan this year‘s team
match the excellence of last
year’s?" Dr, Sauers, starting his
I7lh year as Albany basketball
coach, will have his work cut out
for him, First of all, the '70r-’7l
Great Danes accumulated an im-
pressive 17-5 record that led to
their being rated fifth in the final
New York State College Division
poll. This included winning the
last It) games in a row. Add to
that. the loss of four starters. and
you can perceive the situation.

Missing from this year’s edition
of the l'liiiipsll'i‘s‘ will he co-
(‘aplains‘ Jack Jordan tl-‘ut‘
IIVcrage) and Alan III-id (11.7) at
forward, center Steve Sheehau
(90) and guard .liin MastI-rson
(9,5). That leaves t‘aptain John
Quattroccbi, at guard, as the only
returning start er.

llowever, Quattrocehi brings
with him some impressive
statistics As a sophomore last
year, he averaged III.7 points a
game, and scored over 20 points
in four games. With four starting
berths open, this is how it looks
so far. Don Joss (6‘3"), who
started a few games last year,

appears to have the inside track at
center.

The forward problem will prob-
ably be solvcd by Werner Kolln
(6’4"), a returning letterman, and
sophomores Reggie Smith (6’2"),
and Byron Miller (6'2"), Smith
and Miller both averaged over 10
points for the freshman team last
year, Junior letterman Dave Wel-
chons (6’2") is a good bet for the
other guard.

Sauers feels that the team that
gets the most good shots will win
ballgames, To make sure that the
team will do this,be will employ
such tactics as an aggressive man
to man defense, a full court zone
press, anrl a set offense allowing a
lot of two plays and
requiring the players to think on
their own. “The players will have
to think quickly on their feet, and
react quickly." Although there is
a lack Iif big rebounders to initiate
the fast break, Dr. Sauers will still
have his team running.

This year’s schedule is a tough
one, with the roughest com-
petition likely to come from Hart-
wick, Brockport, and SUNY at
Buffalo. This year’s team is
young, with only three seniors,
and a little green, but is the type
of team that will improve game by

four golden opportunities to get on the scoreboard.
The Danes fumbled twice, deep in Hudson Valley
territory. In the first quarter, they lost the ball on

A look at the stats reveals that both passing

many dropped balls by their ferocious hitting.
