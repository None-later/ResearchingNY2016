‘ A Continual Saga:
‘Great Gate Rip -Off’

by Steve Salant

A new student activity is sweeping the campus.
No, it’s not mumblypeg or tiddlywinks. It entails
breaking down and collecting the electric gates
located on State and Colonial Quads. This is what is
known as "The Great Gate Rip-off."

Although the gates are usually up during the night
and on weekends, students often take it upon
themselves to facilitate their entrance during the
day. A group of students will pull the gate until it
snaps. This is legally classified as criminal mischief
and its consequences could be a jail sentence or a
fine. Security feels that it is not necessary to impose
such harsh penalties for this action and it generally
will make the studentjust pay for the damage. Only
once was a student arrested, and this occurred
because he allegedly started to harrass the officers
who caught him.

Students who participate in this activity may not
always pick up the gates and bring them home, but
passersby will often take them. Students often
consider them a “trophy” and feel that they will
add a little life to their otherwise “drab” rooms.
The “Great Gate Rip-off" is not just limited to
students. Truck drivers making deliveries to the
university like to play this game. Their reasons can
only be guessed iit as expediency.

This activity should not be taken lightly. Its causes
range from student pranks to malicious destruction,
The Colonial Quad gate, according to security, was
completelydestroyed by an axe or a crowbar. The
two gates (Colonial iind State) have been broken
approximately 40 times much to the dismay of
security and to the expense ofstudcnts. The charge
to a student who breaks a gate is $40.00,

Academic Calendars Discussed

The 1972-73 calendar was the
focus of a meeting held an hour
prior to special University Senate
meeting Monday afternoon.

Senators and other interested
persons attending discussed the
various internal and external coli-
straints upon calendar prepara-
tion, three models for the fall
semester and four models for the
spring semester were presented.

Calendar preparation is restric-
ted by “internal parameters”
ranging from the effect on the
quality of the academic program
to deadlines for adding and drop-
ping courses to dates for opening
and closing residences to various
administrative considerations. The
chancellor‘s mandated 30-week in-
struction period for an academic
year is OIH' of the external con-

Environment Exploited by
s Eco-Pornography

Ad-men’

The following is reprinted from
the August 26‘ issue of the wash.
ington Park Spirit:

by Mark Plaat

“Eco-Pornography" is not a pic-
torial magazine whose features ex-
ploit men and women in all sorts
of Kama Sutra positions. It does
not come through the mail in a
plain brown envelope with a Swe-
dish stamp in the upper right hand
corner. Nor do dirty old men
snicker and drool over it for
hours.

Eco-pornography is all around
us everyday. [can be heard on
the radio., seen on T.V.‘, in com-
mercials, and in magazines. Yet
there are no little-Victorian old
ladies protecting young innocents
from such smut and garbage.

The term ecu-pornography may
be familiar to many but it is hard
to deﬁne. After many years of
reading pornography, a person can
usually recognize hard-core ob-
scenity and that which has social
significance. However, if one may
combine a little Webster (ecology)
and the Supreme Court (porno-
graphy) the result is "the cxploila
tion and misuse of environmental
issues and terms."

Ecovpornography can be found
in any media used by business and
corporations to advertise their
products. Bill-boards, one type of
media, are themselves environ-
mentally dcgrading. They must
attract attention and be read
quickly to be an effective adver-
tising medium. Taste is usually the
last criteria considered in creating
these masterpieces of American
art. The Lark “STOP SMOG-
GING" bill-board featured in The
Spirit two issues ago is a prime
example of coo-pornography. An‘
other example is found in the
Atlantic-Richﬁeld bill‘board fca»
turing a scenic photography with
the heading, “How to help keep
America beautful..." '

A more familiar advertising me-
dium, television, has been used
particularly by large corporations
for PR commercials. PR, or Public
Relations, can be defined in two
ways. it can describe programs
that inform the public of contri
butlons to social causes aan tch
acceptance of responsibility in
like matters by large corporations
seeking to improve their public
image. PR can also describe pro-
grams dcsigncd to ciinioliagi- I'll-
vironmental abuse by the large

corporations and industry.

There are many companies who
are slowly accepting their public
responsibilities and have seriously
begun cleaning up. However
most super-corporations spend
more money and time on their PR
than on their pollution abatement
equipment.

.Consider the television commer~
‘(iltll whose narrator broadcasts,

We struck oil in Alaska, 200
miles north of the Artie Circle.
Now men are working there 24
hours a day, seven days a week...
We’re there because our dealers
are in your local neighborhood
He’s so important to us that we’ll
go the ends of the earth to keep
him supplied with products to
take care of your car." No men”
tion is made of the planned Alas-
kan pipeline or the damage to the
ecology of the Alaskan wilderness
if such a pipeline is built. Getting
the product to dealers is given
primary importance in this come
mercial, and the environmental
threat to Alaska is ignored.

Many products themselves have
taken an ecological bent. Low-
phosphate detergents have all but
flooded the amrket in the rush to
save the environment. Some low-
phosphatc detergents will actually
clean your clothes. Others, such as
the now infamous ECOLO-(i dt~
tcrgcnt can be harmful to clothes
and humans. ECOLO-G (pro-
nounccd ecology) came on the
market soon after the first Earth
Day, Sales zoomed as houswivcs
could now do their part for the
environment, This was fine until it
was discovered that ECOLOG
was almost one-half salt, did not
clean clothes very well and caused
skin rashes.

'l‘rash Maslicrs are another line
of products which are advertised
as a solution to an environmental
problem. In reality, this line of
products does more harm than
good. The spray used to dc
-odc,ri2c the garbage when com-
pressed, prcvcnls food from do
composing naturally. (fans and
bottles are crushed together. and
cannot be recycled or reused,

Locally, ecu-pornography cxixts
iii nl)‘.:|i(l.ttl(‘t'. Une radio station in
Particular, Wl’Tli, has a nasty habit
of using the word “ecology” lltr‘
fore the limc (Ecology NOW linu-
is ), a practicc completely with»:
oul significance 'l'lii-re is :i dil'fi-r-
i-ncc llt‘lWl'l'lI the llVl'l"ll.\t‘ of .i
couiilcr culturc Icon and [he nus-

uses of language that should de-
scribe critical ecological issues. E-
cology, as defined by WeMer, is
that branch of science concerned
with the interrelationships of or-
ganisms and their environment. Its
meaning should be taken far more
seriously than the media would
often have us think.

Eco-pornography has not escaped
criticism from the business com-
muninity. Malcolm S. Forbes,
president of Forbes Magazine at-
tacted the use of eco-pornography
in an editorial entitled “No Room
on the Bandwagon,"

“...With such a stampede to
board the anti-pollution band-
wagon, some people are falling off
in their attempts to climb on,
falling flat on their faces in front
of the wheels.”

Jerry Mandcr, president of a San
Franciscan advertising agency,
prepared a portfolio of Eco-
pornography to accompnay an ar-
ticle in Scanlans Monthly. Some
of his selections included: Stand-
ard Oil's “Announcing the most
long awaited gasoline develop-
ment in history;" Shell's "Last
year we saved a lot of fish from
drowning. And made a lot of kids
happy," Humble Oil’s "This bird
sanctuary is an oil field," Bethlev
hL-m Steel’s “What in the world
does a forester do at Bethlehem
Sleek” 'Westinghouue’s "ware
providing electricity through
clean, safe, nuclear power;” and
(florets "Do you share to Clean
the Air with a little help from
Clorcts.” "

A recent survey at SALES MANu
AGEMENT, a marketing maga
llllu, asked, “Docs Ecology Sell?”
The results revealed that compan»
ics vying to paint their products
into ecological sainthood often
and up as martyrs.

Advertisers and marketing men
have a common unofficial slogan.
“If it sells my product, use it."
With increasing awareness of the
environment, fewer people have
accepted coo-pornography as
truth. The waste land which is
H'ovpornograpliy will disappear if
it does not sell products. and it is
not now selling products.

'l'hccoiisbmeris advised to dif-
ferentiate between truthful iidver~
tising claims and the not so-
Iruthful. The theory of consumer
sovereignty mny oflcn seem more
iiiylli than fact. However. the
I'Ullhllllll‘l‘ \vdl finally decide what
I.\ Milli by what lll‘ buys.

 

Industry Logs In
Anti-pollution Fight

AP— A $200,000 ﬁne was im-
posed yesterday upon the Ana-
conda Wire and 'Cable Company
for 100 unlawful discharges of
copper and other wastes into the
Hudson River from its plant at
Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

Federal Judge Thomas F.
Croake fined the company, which
pleaded guilty last Sept. 27 to a
100-count indictment alleging

spills five days a week from Jan. 4"

to May 2~l from its Westchcster
county mill.

A special anti-pollution grand
jury, filing charges Sept. 8, alleged
infractions of the Federal Refuse
Act of 1899..

Company officials told the judge
last Sept. 27 that the plant had
remedied the situation in compli-
ance with New York State anti-
pollution standards.

Without further interpretation,
Judge Croakc told company offi-
cials: uThis cannot be considered
part of the overhead of a business.
That is my thinking, and l have
given it very serious considera-
tion."

Undcr the lIIW, fines ranging up
lo $2,500 for cach violation could
be imposed. (Ironke sct $2,000 for
each, ordering the company to
pay by Dec. 1.

Earth News

The Council on Economic
Priorities released it report which
revealed that many ad claims by
major manufacturers are false or
misleading.

The Council on Economic
Priorities (CE?) is a non-profit
organization, similar to Ralph
Nader‘s organizations. Earlier this
year CEP released an extensive
study on the paper industry, ex-
plaining how polluting that parti-
cular industry is.

The report reveals that the
major polluters do most “environ-
mental advertising." That is, CEP
found that the companies with
the worse pollution records spend
more money on advertising either
disclaiming pollution complaints
or claiming that the companies
don't pollute more than the lesser
polluters.

Thc CEP report cites many spe-
cific cases, among them the adver-
tising done by both Ford Motor
Company and General Motors.
Bolh GM and Ford, according to
the report, adVertisc that they
have reduced pollution cmmisions
from 65 percent to Rt) pcrcenton
ltl7| curs. CEP, however, cites a
California study which shows that
75 pcrccnt of the 1071 cars on
the road failed to meet that cri-
tcria.

“Ford claims that auto emission
comprises oiily 30 percent of total
.iir pollution," CEl’ says. “Yet
t‘l'Il‘ \lttin' auto pollution impact
on urban .ircas I\ over 75 per-
cent."

’l‘hi- rcpt-rt also states "The
images council by generalized
ciiiiiiis or not consistent with
thosc conveyed by specifics in the
news," t‘l‘Il’ says that this leads to
a "frustrating conflict which in
light of the growing US. concern
over the condition of our environ-
nicnt...inay not be tolerated much
