   

JEFF BECK GROUP: Rough
and Ready (Epic 30973)

After being immobilized for two
years by a motorcycle accident,
Jeff Beck, former lead guitar of
the Yardbirds and the Jeff Beck
Group (with Rod Stewart) has
formed a new band that includes a
black singer. Jeff Beck playing
soul-rock music? Yeah, it hit me
kind of funny at first. Since Beck
is noted for his flaming egotism
and a desire to lay down as much
guitar as possible (which was fine
within the context of his other
groups) it seemed rather unlikely
that he would adapt to the new
sound.

But yes, he does adapt. There is
still enough of the most unpredic-
table, staccato guitar in rock, but
Beck does not get carried away
with himself, and adds much to
the mood of each song. Ironically,
vocals do not play it large role in
the proceedings. Bob Teiich has a
pretty good voice and he excells
in "I've Been Used," “Got the
Feeling," and “Short Business"
but his range is rather weak and
he has trouble handling «we bat
lads like “Jody.” Perhaps this is
the reason his vocals are staioncd
rather far in the background.

“Got the Feeling" shows off tiie
new Beck. It hiis a typical soul
opening with Beck grinding out
some notes on wah-wah pedal.
Overduhbing of guitar and piano
is used extensively so a smooth,
complete feeling is obtained. A
variety of sounds by Beck fills in
any empty spaces. Max Middle-
ton, who spent many years play-
ing classical piano, combines
many unusual notes to produce an
exotic solo with a touch of latin
flavor. The rhythm section of bass
player Clive Chaman and drum-
mer Cozy Powell, probably the
most essential part of soul music
supplies a lot of punch. An auspi-
cious start.

"Situation" has an intro buildup
that gchs Beck plenty of oppor-
tunity to explode but he surprises
with a soft, legato line that leads
right into the opening verse. Later
on, his fuzzy guitar solo is con-
trasted with the velvet touch of
Middleton on electric piano,

Don't expect another "Rice
Pudding" or “Beck's Bolero"
from the 8:25 instrumental
“Rayncs Park Blues," which in
spite of it's misleading title is a
jazz piece. The theme takes too
long in unfolding and there is too
much Wasted space, though by no
means can the song he called filler
material for there are plenty of
ideas, the problem is that they're
too sketchy.

 
 

 
 

Tightness is the main quality of
“Short Business" and “I'Vt- Been
Used." The latter opens with an
eerie syncopated heat but llieii
quickly atrnightt-ns tnit into the
main theme. Teach, drowning in
pain, is at his best here.

The last two songs on the album
point out some Weakness i the
group's format. “New Ways Train
Train" utilizes ideas from Traffic,
James Gang, and Buddy Miles
Without having ii personality of its
own. The constant swnches in

.lI' .ire ii little hard to lake and
for all the music layeil down,
there is very little accomplished.
"Jody" underlines the lack of
good material at hand. Still, the
music is strong enough to leap any
hurdles. Middleton's magic carpet
ride electric piano solo that ends
the album is sheer geniouii. IIc
steals the spotlight from Beck.

“Rough and Ready‘ may not be
what you expect but it doesn't
intend to be. If you give it a little
time, you could be pleasantly
surprised. So Jeff Beck has soul.
What do you know?

Electric Hot Tuna:
“FIRST PULL UI'.THEN PULL
DOWN" iRecordcd live)

RCA LSI’4550

Joriiiu Kuiilioncii, electric guitar
and vocals; Jack Cusudy, electric
bass; Papa John Ci'caclt, electric
violin. Will Scarlett, harmonica;
Sammy Piazza, drums.

Jack and Jorma are at it again.
First time 'round they fooled us
with an album of stunningly exA
ecutcd acoustic blues when we'd
expected a rock jam set. This time
'round they give us what we first
looked for, plus some extra goodv
ies. Papa John Crcach, the veteran
(53 years old) black electric viov
linist We saw here when the Air-
plane flew in last fall, is aboard.
and Sammy I’iazza, a get-it-on
rock and roll drummer if there
ever was one, replaced the succes-
sion of lackluster drummers
(Spence, Dryden, and Covington)
that Jack and Jorma havu had
with them. Oh..,and for laughs
they didn't. put the album title on
the cover (it's in small print on
the side), so this LI‘ is the one
with the yellow and aqua swirly
design on the cover, ()K'.’

It's a fine piece of work. The
predominant ﬂavors are jazzy and
bluesy, with traces of oldtiine
swing fading in and out as the
musicians jam on, Jorma‘s vocal‘s
are, well, there. His voice won't
make you forget iinylmily's but
his style and inflection are excel-
lent for this type of music and he
delchrs the drivineg urgent yet
somehow distant sense of longing

that makes “Been So Long" and
“Come Back, Baby" smolder and
burn, Scarlett is an intriguineg
inventive harp player and I’apa
John plays a jazzy, bluesy electric
violin that often sounds Ilkt‘ a
reed. Jack backs .lormii steadily
and Sammy keeps 'cm rockin.
Basically, though, the show he—
longs to Jormii. ilia influence has
continued to he himself, and he is
riot avarse to cupping figures from
his own earlier work. Little echoes
of Jorma-isli embellishment of old
Airplane standards abound, but
the musical context is different. If
you‘re looking for melody and
harmony and oldvfashioned songs
you won't care too much for this
disc, but if you can get your head
into some really crisp playing it‘s
there to love.

The PENTANGLE's new album
"Reflection" (Reprise liltiil), is
by far the best. album by this
English l‘olkvjazz group since their
initial disc about two and a half
years ago. “Try to relax and let
your mind run free“ says Bert
Janscli in “Helping Hand" and
this is the overall philosophy of
the album, one of the most re-
laxing of the year.

With two of England‘s finest
acoustic guitarists in Ber! Jansch
and John Renbourn and two very
competent vocalists tJansch and
Jacqui McShee), the only surprise
is that it took this long for PEN-
TANGLE to record their defin-
itive album. Where in previous
outings, Jnnsch and chbotirn
fought each other in the guitar
solos, here they meld their styles
into a tasty sound. Instruments
that up until the last album were
not synomous with the group,
namely sitars, banjos, harp, and
electric guitars are utilized to
achieve a more complete sound.
The material deals more with the
American folk idiom than pre-
viously, so that even an over-
worked song |ikc”Will The Circle
Be Unbroken?“ gets new life
pumped into it. Throughout,
Jansch is at the top of his form,
and McShee’s sweet voice is as
helpful as butter on hot toast.

Showing remarkable consis'
tency, each cut is about as good as
the next, with the II miiitite
finale "Reflection" the standout
if only for the fliudity it displays
during it's long life. McShee's
voice, backed up lightly by Jansch
is likely to send shivers down your
spine.

seems, rather, like the logical con-
clusion of all the previous mater-
ial. Everything that has been
learned has been merged here-
-jazz, folk, blues, pop, and rock
are incorporated into a smooth
and natural synthesis. And a
back-up chorus that includes Mer-
ry “Gimme Shelter" Clayton is
the perfect compliment to the
band. Butterfield shares the spot-
light, cven more than usual, with
the other members of his group.
As he said in a recent interview:
“I don't want to play all the solos
on all the songs; I want some
other folks to play. I‘ve got some
cats that can really play!" You'll
feel like smiling.

 

T. Rex, “Electric Warrior" Re-
prise 6466

When T. REX played here last
year they were pathetically inept.
Of course, any group would have
been a letdown after the speeding
fury of JOHNNY WINTER AND
but Marc Bolan's gooey preten-
tiousness and phony havingsuch-
ngoodtimc attitude fell just a bit
short of being a good stage act, I
was quite prepared to dislike the
new T. REX album “Electric War»
rior" (Reprise 6466) but believe it
or not, it's not bad. No world
shocker by any means, but a
decent album. If you can accept
Bolan's magical lyrics of cosmic
oneness as a goof then you will
probably enjoy the music that
accompanies it. A typical Bolan
lyric: “Beneath the bebop moon/I
want to croon with you/Beneath
the Mambo Sun/I got to be the
one with you" or: “Shallow are
the actions of the children of
inch/bogged was their vision since
the ages began/and lost like a lion
in the canyons of smoke/Girl it‘s
no joke." When IlII' lyrics degen-
erate iiilo triteness, the music is
just that much better to compen-
sate. In addition, the string ill"
rangements and the saxophoni-
work of Ian McDonald of KINU
CRIMSON fame fills in any loose
cracks in the foundation.

Chuck Mangione has been
around for quite a while. The fact,
that he has now made an album
that has actually, in part, received
some airtime can not be inter-
preted as an indication that Man-
gione has just now become a good
musician.

I remember picking up an old
album by the Jazz Brothers, with
Sal Nistico on tenor, Chuck's
brother on piano, Roy Mc-
Curdy—Who later joined Cannon-
ball Adderley—on drums, and a
less prominent cat, Vinney
Rugiero, or something, on bass.
Chuck was alreme playing real
nice trumpet, creating an original
style which fit comfortably be-
tween Miles Davis and Dizzy (hl
lcspic. Sal Nistico was not :is
flashy then but played ll nice
Sonny Rollins influenced tenor.
The group was called the Jazz
Brothers, and they originated out
of Rochester, and were “dis
covered" by Cannonball Adder
ley, who had a large part in
signing them up with Rin-rside, il
now defunct jazz label.

Chuck was doing some nice
writing then, so when The Jazz
Brothers broke up (.‘huck was
given the opportunity to write
some Charts for Maynard Fer-
guson. He also played and wrote
for Art Blakey.

After starving in New York he
returned to Rochester, taught at
Eastman, and just kept growing
musically. He was into compo
sition so be naturally gravitated
towards classical music. Being
young he learned to appreciate
rock and folk, Meanwhile he was
playing jazz at the clubs in the
area, and sitting in when he could.

Sitting in has always been part
of his life. As a kid his father had
him sit in with some of the greats
who came around to play. Father
Mangionc would also get the
musicians to visit the house, haVe
something to eat. (and drink) and
blow till all hours of the night.
Dizzy Gillespie was so impressed
by Chuck‘s playing that he gave
him one of his updo horns. Chuck
used it on his first record date.

So Chuck Maingionc‘s past led to
do the rather remarkable concert
that ‘. recorded on lt'I'It'lltls tlllil

Empire State College Offers
Alternative to Classrooms

hv Ferris Eiiock

Empire State College, ii new
division of the SUNY system,
offers its students till! chance to
definc education in their own
terms. In this school the emphasis
is on accomplishment rather than
tradition and requirements.

The school operates out. of
“learning centers" located in
many parts of the state. This
“no-campus" idea was initiated
for both the convenience of the
student and the state. The stu-
dents is not restricted lo 
rooms in his educational endea-
vors while the state feels no strain
on its budget and is able to
accommodate the increasing num-
ber of college students,

   

Working to satisfy the needs of
an expected 10,000 students,
learning centers will be opening in
all i’t‘gitilis of the state by |ll7ll.
'I'hc first cent-r was opened in
October in Saratoga Springs and
servvs as headquarters for the col-
lege. Albany's center, which
opened on November 8 in I‘Utinl
(ill in the basement of Draper
llzill, Will be followed by the
opening of ii center in Manhattan
next week

 

At‘t‘t-ptniit'e Hill) the pi'tigi‘nlii is
based on desire and sincerity. Ap
plii':iiil.s Willi these qualities are
accepted on a 'irst conic, first
served basis. After a Iil‘ll'f orieii
IililtiII Where the philosophy of
the college is discussed, each stuv
dt-nt l.i assigned a mentor \’Iiti
iiieels Willi the student at one of
the centers to help develop a
meaningful pillll lo the attainment
of his goal. A "contract," or plan
of study content and length, is
drawn up in llll' first of these
met-tings The contract usually lli
lows an exploratory period of
several weeks before lllt' student
settles on a definite goal.

The contract generally lusts be-
tween a month and a year and
specifies obligations of both the
student iind the mentor, including

a definite plan for at least
monthly meetings between the
two. In these one-to-onc evalu-
ation sessions, the emphasis is
placed on student self-evaluation
of his work. When the contract
has been successfully completed
and evaluated, the student starts
the process all over again with his
choice of mentor and time ar~
rangcincnt, The student has the
option of waiting awhile before
signing another contract.

Students pursue their individual
programs in three basic modes of
learning; the discipline mode, the
problem mode and the experience
mode. The discipline mode is
most similiir to straight college
tradition. The student will con-
centrate on ii particular field of
study such as English or History.
A program following the problem
mode will probably be, as the
catalogue states, “a major social
issue or a comprehensive unit of
study which draws upon diverse
kinds of skills and knowledge..."
The experience mode allows the
suttlent the most freedom from
regiilnr college routine. The em-
phasis under this type of study
will he on action in the form of
“on-thcvjob experiences of volun-
teer activities." All Ulllt’l‘ reading
and studying will help to supple-
ment and explain the student‘s
day to day experiences.

Many people encumbered with
job and family commitments find
I‘illipll‘t' College able to supply
them with the education they
iiiiglii never have had the chance
to get. Any experiences they bring

to the college is considered
toward "credit" for their "de-
gree."

t‘ollege and high school students
discouraged With current formal
institutions of higher learning are
offered this opportunity to take
their education entirely into their
own hands, All students enrolled
in the program are members of
the SUNY community, pay the
same tuition, iind are entitled to

use all the resources open to any
other SUNY student. In this way,
they benefit from the new
direction of the program and thtI
traditional facilities
with a college.

associated

What started out as an idea has
now flourished into a working
experiment. Support. and en-
couragement has come froiu the
faculty involved to the commun-
itics housing the learning centers.
Publicity has just begun to pick
up, but by August ltl7l there
were already 5,000 queries from
students asking if Empire College
was the college for them, If you're
interested, as is Bob DiNunzio,
one student enrolled at the
college, in an “alternate approach
to education which at it's iiiosl
idealistic form will provide an
infinite number of learning modes
in progress toward a goal”, thcn
Empire State College is for you.

Senate Charged
With Corruption

by Glenn von Nostitz

At a capitolipross conference Wednesday, Albert Loftus, former aide
to State Senator Walter Langley, refuted charges made by Senate
Secretary Albert Abrams that his revelation of downstate corruption
are “untrue” and “implausible.”

Last week Loftus claimed that Abrams sent him to Brooklyn to
work on the campaign oftNathaniel Hendricks, a Republican who was

.running in a special election against incumbent Senator Ferro. Loftus
said that he was on the Senate payroll at the time, as was Dominoc
Robortella, a legislative assistant who accompanied him. They were
given the keys to state car No. 999, and Loftus said that he personally
helped load Senate office supplies into the car and delivered them to
Hendrick‘s headquarters at the Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn. They also
had the use of a state credit card.

Assisting on the ‘ampaign were fifty members of the SUNYA Young

Republicans Club, who paid for their own transportation and

accommodations in Brooklyn in order to distribute

-ampaign liter-

ature door-todoor. The students were coordinated by six professional
politicians from the Senate, Whether they were on the Senate payrool
at. the time is not. known. Despite the alleged use of Senate funds and
supplies, and the hpr of Albany State students, Hendricks still lost.

In refuting Abram's charges, Loftus said that he “hasproof” to back
tip all his charges, and he announced that he is demanding ii public
investigation of the alleged corruption. So far, Loftus has been
unsuccessful in obtaining such an investigation. He went to Re-
publican District Attorney Arnold Proskin's office, but Proskin “was
out of town, visiting Disney World." One of Proskin's aides told him
t.hat,“We cannot conduct an investigation into your charges due to a
manpower shortage." Lol'tus then Went to Attorney General Lef-

kowitz's

office, and was informed

there that :thcy

could not

investigate his charges unless ordered to by the Governor. Still
undisinnycd, Loftus went. to the Governor's office, and was received

by William Demino, an ass

 

mani counsel. Deniiiio, Loftus says, told

him to go back to Proskin‘s office and “try again." Loftus adds,
tongue in check, that he received the “run-around" because all of the
officials he saw are Republicans.

Responding to a question about the involvement of SUNYA
students, Lol'tus said that the campaign material distributed by the
students “could have been" printed illegally, meaning that Senate
funds were used.

“Although the amount of money involved in this crime may be
small," Loftus says“‘crimes are committed all the time in the State

Legi ~

 

attire.“ He Went on to say that such corruption is not limited to

downstate, and that in the l‘.l7tl elections, several incumbent upstate
Republicans were assisted by Senate funds. “These crimes," he
concludes, “add up to several hundred thousiindldollars" stolen from
the people of this state by their lawmakers,

Lol'ttis

doesn't place all the blame

for Senate corruption on

Secretary Abrams. He says that it. is “ the majority party under the
direction of Earl Brydgcs" who run the Senate and who must be

“brought to justice“.

Loftus proposes to do this himself if an

investigation of his charges is not begun soon. As a last resort, he plans
to challenge Abrams in a “court of law". He claims that he will not. let.
this issue fade away.

Finally, Loftus says that he hiis information on the corrupt practices
of several other legislators, and that this is the result, “when
Republicans remain in power too long."

Loftus, who is only 19, worked on the campaign of Republican
Senator Walter Langley last year, and Wits appointed as an tilde to him
after the election. He says that Langley paid him a salary of $125 a
week. Loftus was reportedly fired by Langley.
