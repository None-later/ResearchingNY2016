Cosmic Quad Deﬁes
Edward Durell Stone

by Ann Bunker

On a wooded slope of our per-
fectly proportional campus stands
one of Albany State’s most well-
kept secrets: a fifth uptown resi-
dence structure. It’s so well-kept a
secret that even old E.D. Stone is
unaware of its existence. There it
stands, absolutely untouched by
his influence, a monument to in-
dependence and originality: Cos-
mic Quad!

Rising triumphantly from one of
our not-too-publicized junk-heaps,
the small but very liveable domoid
structure bravely defies con-
vention. Here stone and glass give
way to wood and vinyl, uni-
formity to ingenuity, waste to
utility. Nature. not geometry,
dominates the landscape. The
proximity of construction refuse,
while it detracts from the aes-
thetic appearance of the setting, IS
in this case an asset. It has pro-
vided many materials of use to the
creators.

 

right here on campus.

Now you can buy Fisher stereo

Fisher selected ll'llS student because he
is uniquely qualified to act as yourFisher
representative. He knows a lot about high fidelity.
He's a reliable person. And since he's a student

way olstereo equipment.

And srnce he's the Fisher representative
he's got what you need. Because Fisher
makes practically everything.

 

The responsibility for this re-
markable accomplishment lies pri-
marily with two SUNYA students.
With the approval of the Environ-
mental Decisions Committee and
a little help from their friends,
Davc Formanek and Mark Gar-
finkle have built a multi-purposo
geodesic dome. The project serves
primarily as an exploration of
alternative housing and (lemon-
strates that, with limited
knowledge and materials and it
great deal of resourcefulness, it is
possible to create a pleasant and
liveable dwelling. The project has
expanded from its original in-
tentions; aside from serving us It
part time dwelling, the dome
serves also as a meditation center,
experimentation station and
occasional wildlife observatory.

Scheduled for dismantling in
May, Cosmic Quad is capany
equipped to weather the on-
slought of an Albany winter, It
boasts such conveniences as fiber-
glass and burlap insulation, :1
woodburning oven for heat, and it
gasoline stove for cooking.
Sleepingbags, blankets and ade-
quate provisions are in evidence,
as are a couple of black cuts for
company, Who could ask for

Visitor’s New Lot

by Claude Weinberg

l‘hc usually deserted visitor's parking lot has been the subject of
scvcriil questions ranging from its purpose to its lack of financial
SllCt'OSS.

According to Sccui‘ily ('ll'l'icci' Wojcicki. thc original intention of thc
lot was lhr' accommotlntion of nccdcd space for visitors. lll' said that
ll was built for thc various confi-rcnccs llltll lzikc plricc :it SUNYA. and
to li-sscn thc friction with studcnl cur owncrs. thn :iskcd about the
.ippiircnl ill)lll1tl:lll(‘t‘ of spzicc, \Vojcickt cliiimcd that if llicrc \Vcrcn'l
Nil many illcgrilly piirki-(l curs. thi-ri- \vould lll' morc cars in the parking
lot "l‘i-opli- would l‘illllt‘l' lziki- :i chance on paying $1215 for ii low
|lll| |lt.'ttl paying lltt‘lt' two bits an hour." lic said. As of now, violators
who don't pay within :li) days llith‘ their parking privilcgcs rcvoki-d.

'l'lic visitor's parking lot cost approximiitcly $13,000 to build. Jami-s
Williams, Dircclor of Sccurily, snirl flint thcrc are at any time during
llll‘ day, approximately 30-50 cars in thc lot. The 156 car capacity lot
ichrrigcs l 10 cars each day. The original goal was to bring in $100 ii
day, but they have been averaging $67 at day. Williams said that the
“state doesn't providc one red cent for upkeep, maintenance, etc. For
example, it costs $2,000 to paint the yellow lines in the middle of thc
road. The parking lot was the first time we built, something with our
own llanCI'nlii '.)or and we (lid a damn good job"

Williams said he i‘ciilizcs that. there are only it f'cw cars using the lot
()nc of the reasons for this is the lack of :idcquiilc signs. “c said that
visitors cannot find the parking lot :Itl(l lhal thcy usually taki-spziccs
by lhc administration building, and the professor's spiiccs because it is
morc convenient.

llowr-vcr. Williams cxprcsscd assurance that thc present situation is
not permanent. He said that as tho wciitlicr worscns, pcoplc will be
t'orcr-rl to usc thc visitors' parking lot and that as visitors gcl into thi-
habit of parking thcrc they will continuc to park llii‘rc in the Spring.
Williams also said that llicy will soon hcgin leasing llic empty SptH'l'.
This will hi'lp l'ill lltc lot. 'I‘Iii'rc arc also plans to assign pcoplc to
various lots which will hpr l't'(lLl(‘(‘ thc illi-gril parking.

Williams concludcd that :is thc iiniycrsity grows, so will thi- nccd for
parking spnci'. “Wc‘d rathcr h:ch thc spiii'c now than how- to ilouhli- it
