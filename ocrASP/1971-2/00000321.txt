Women to March

Earth News

Support around the country is growing for the marches this Saturday in Washington, DC. and San

Francisco which will demand the repeal of all existing abortion laws.

The numbers of men and women who will be marching in the demonstrations appears to be growing
more because of the work of an anti-abortion group than from the efforts of the Women's National

Abortion Action Coalition, the sponsors of the rallies.

The anti-abortion forces, called Pro-Life, are organizing counter demonstrations in both San Francisco
and Washington. In the nation's capital pro-abortion forces will gather on the west steps of the Capitol
Building. On the other side of the building anti-abortion forces will gather and hear speakers denounce

abortion.

Support grew for the San Francisco march this week when the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted
to keep the street in front of city hall open on Saturday. instead of closing it as the women had asked. The
block long section of the street has been closed several times before to allow demonstrations.

The Abortion Coalition originally called for the street in front of the Federal Building to be closed, but
the police department advised them to request the street in front of city hall instead. When the Coalition
went to the supervisors meeting to request the new area the police department spoke against the closing.

as did seven anti-abortion supporters.

The Coalition interpreted the pallet: department interference as a sign of alliance with the Pro-Life

forces and a debate began.

Speakers at the Washington rally will include Shirley Wheeler, a Tampa, Florida woman who was
convicted of manslaughter for having an abortion in Florida, Joyce Brown, and Billie Jean King, the
famous women’s tennis player and women's rights spokeswoman: :Earlli News.

Draft Fool-op

Numerous suits have been filed across the liation within the last two
Weeks to take advantage of an apparent loophole in the Selective
Service Act which was signed by President Nixon in late September.

The oversight in the new draft bill Could mean that the Selective
Service System will not be able to draft the [0,000 men it needs during
the next three months.

What the civil suits artI about concern “Section ‘20" in the new

Selective Service Act which reads: “No person shall l)c inducted or

ordered into active service without his consent under this Illlt‘ within
ill) days after the date of its enactment." Bccausc I’residcnt Nixon
signed the bill into law on September 28th. new inductees ' '
that they cannot be drafted unlil Dccomhcr 27th.

 

Legal groups across the nation (including the Committee for Legal
Research on the Draft" at Harvard Unchrsily) Ii;ch successfully
stopped inductions of individuals in seven cities in the country.
Attorney Scott 'l‘cppcr reports lliat selective scrvicc legal advisors arc
planning to file "literally hundrcds more suits within llic next few
days."

The reason that the loophole exists iii the prt cnt law, which is
contained under Section 20 of the St-lcctivc Scrvict- Act, is bccausc
tlic iicw act was copied almost exactly after the Selective Service Act
of “NH. 'l'hat act intentionally contained a “90 day waiting period " to
allow thc Sch-clch Service three months to reorganize ilsclf.

In any case, draft attorneys ari- advising reluctant inductees to
immcdilitcly con tact draft resistance boards and to file suits if lhl-y
want to fight induction. Said atloriil-y 'l‘cppcr: “Just tell your draft
lawyer that you want to file under Section 2t). llc'll know what you
mean.

The Hclcclivc Hcrvicc System in Washington acknowlcdgcd that at
least. iii inductccs had already filcd suits undcr “Sci'tion Bil "
lI(lWl'VI'I" a spokesman for the Department said that courts in Boston
ruled this wcck llial they were throwing “Suction 2t)" (‘uscs out of
court ili cfl'ccl. ruling in favor of thc local draft boar(., H‘nld tlic
