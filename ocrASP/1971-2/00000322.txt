Lack of Foresight

To the Editor:

I write this lettcr with the hope that thc ptlsslllll
system will be seriously reviewed and revised to
offer other grading options. If you wish to completi-
your undergraduate work herc or anywhere Within
the State University syslcm, thcn transferring won‘t
be a great problem, Howevvr, for whaicVi-r advan‘
tages pass-fail offcrs, once you atlcmpt Iii lt'ith‘ this
system, you suddenly ri-alizc that llic plan isn‘t very
realistic. Enrollment al otlit-r scliotils is limilcd, and
admission is on a competitive basis Most otlicr
schools still usc a traditional grading iiicthod.
Naturally you must dcmonstrati- to ilic other
universities that yoii'ri- at Icast capable of i'iilli-gc
level work, and morc qiialit'ii-(l than many otlii-r
students who arc also applying. Wcll. :il'ti-r :iccuniic
lating "S" marks for two yi-ars. _\‘oii'vc siicci-cdi-d in
provoig that you can llilllfllt' collcgi- work Nci'crtlic
less. you will lack substantial l'VI(ll'llt‘l' to show wht'
acccptaiicc should bc graiitcd to you rather than

What I meant by my statement was that my time
was wasted here, and that I probably would've been
mOrO satisfied at another school. The omission of
this fact was my error, but the fault of the misquote
is that of the ASI’. I hope you‘ll be more careful in
the future.

appeared this semester without notice. Second, there are no postcd
regulations specifying times when vehicular traffic is pt‘t'lnlllorl “ml
when it is not. Rather, the gates are opened and closed in a t‘tilitlom
fashion. 'I’hird, what is the purposc of these gates being chm-it 1”
night? These gates prevent any vehicular access to t hc Quads, unit ,.
driver desiring to drop off a passenger, must makc his passcngcr walk .i
long, dimly lit distance. With the tremendous iiicrcasc of crime on
campus this is absurd . Mali- and/or fcmalc fact- an tiiiiiccc 'ary risk.
Granted, parking should not bc permitted; but passenger pick-up ,in
disposal as well as vehicular access after 5 PM should not

 

“warning notices” on all the cars. Lct’s face it - the Indian Quad,
Parking lot as it now stands is a hazard, Besides being surrounded by
Woods there is absolutely no lighting to or from the .‘itlo—loo t'oiii
walk through the field. Ask any member of your night shift and he'll
tell you it's it very dark walk. So until whatcvcr dcpartiiicnl

basic lighting, I think your department should hold off tickctiiig t‘ai‘s.

whom force and extremism cxcrcisc a perverse
fascination. European fascist parties in the thirties
had a good quote of leaders who had once been at
the ltlllt‘l end of tlic political rainbow. Indeed the
caiiipuscs of Gciiiiany and Austria were fertile
sonic-cs of Nari tlltlllptht‘t‘, both faculty members
and students. and of (‘ommiiiiist manpower as well.

What all ilicsc had in common was a scorn for the
ott‘icc-lioldiiig buiiihlci's III the middle. who couldn‘t
enjoy tlic luxury of slirilly preaching the one and
only tiiilli because they always had to have an ear
cockcd on the iiiiccilaiii voice of tlic pcoplc,
Nciihci could the same humblcrs force that voice to
