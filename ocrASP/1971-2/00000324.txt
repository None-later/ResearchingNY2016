Pace Visits Saturday

The second season of club foot-
ball concludes Saturday for State
University at Albany. The Great
Danes, 2-4 last season, will take a
3-Al record into the 1 p.m. finale
against visiting Pace College.

A better indicator than its won-
lost record of how far the team
has come in one year was last
Saturday's game at Hudson Val-
ley. The Vikings annihilated AI-
bany last fall, 61-13. This time
around, a first-period field goal
put the only points on the board
and HVCC held on for a 3-0
victory. It marked the first time in
25 games Hudson Valley had been
unable to score a touchdown.

Albany coach Bob Ford called it
the Danes‘ best defensive effort to
date and pronounced himself “ex-
ceptionally pleased,“ although dis-
appointed with the loss. “I've
never been us proud of my kids,"
he said. “We stopped them six
times in our territory and did a
great job against their quarter-
back, Bill Gorman, an outstanding
passer." German completed just
seven of 26 for 62 yards.

Singled out for special praise on
the defensive unit were end
Vinnie Pierce '(Albany), tackles
Frank Vilanova (Schenectady)
and Jim “Tiny” Holloway (Syra-
cuse), linebackers Arnie Will

injuries. the Danes were unable to
move the ball consistently against
Hudson Valley's strong defense.
Carvin Payne (Niagara Falls)
gained 86 yards, more than half of
the team's rushing total. Three
fumbles and as many inter-
ceptions proved costly, as Albany
missed several scoring opportun-
ities.

Swimmers Open Season
With Great Dane Relays

by Linda Meyers

The Great Dane swimming team
will host the Great Dane Relays
at 1 p.m. Monday to open its
1971-72 season. Competing in the
relays will be Columbia Univer-
isty, Lehman College, RPI, New
Falls. and Eulton~Montgomery
CC.

This is the third year of varsity
swimming at Albany and eoaeh
Brian Kelly hopes to see signifi~
cant improVement. ’I‘he Danes
posted 1—10 and 2’11 records
their first two years, but have nine
lettermen returning from last
year, providing a strong nucleus,
and making this the most experi-
eneed team to date. The team
looks strongest in the butterfly,
backstroke, individual medley,
middle and distance freestyle.
