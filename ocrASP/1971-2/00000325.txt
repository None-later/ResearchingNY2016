Opinion

   

One wonders why Mr. Jack
Schwartz would lake the lime to
write a lengthy column for lhu
ASP when his own newspaper,
Siiii'i'l/irc, has been so lavishly
funded and serves us :i marvelous
forum for his particular brand of
politics. Then, again, chi'l/iri' is
slowly sinking into bankruptcy
and will bl.‘ l'orccd Iii comi'hm'k In
Central Council shortly for some
more of my tax mom-y ; so pur-
ltnps Jzick is trying In I'm-l out
some new avenues for his political
insanity.

Bul whatever his reasons for
writing the column, it svrvvs tn
