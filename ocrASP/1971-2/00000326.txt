In an overwhelming avalanche of
community support, kids on State
Quad voted the People's Record
Co-op into existence by a nearly
four-to-one vote margin.

A meeting will be held next
Monday night to discuss what,
exactly, the terms of the $l000
loan will be. It is hoped, by the
members of the Co-op committee.

that the actual loan process can be
done quickly and easily without
hassle. If so, it is possible that the
actual opening of the Record Co
Op may take place before the end
of the semester.

In between recording sessions and concerts, you'd think Blood.
Sweat 8i Tears might want to take a vacation lrom mustc. Far
from it. That's when they catch up on their listening. And that's
how we happannad to catch Lew Sololl, Stave Katz, and Bobby
Colomby at Bobby's place listening to current releases by their
lavorite artists, on Bobby’s Pioneer stereo system.

As proleuional musicians, they insist on lull natural sound.
When they play back their favorite records, they want to make
certain that the sound that’s recorded is the sound they hear.
That's why each ol them has his own stereo system built around

The PAC:

Claudine Casaan and Ron Abel
will be giving SUNYA “something
different" tonight in their concert
in the PAC Recital hall at 8:30
p.m., admission free.

The program, entitled The
Sweetest Sounds, will feature
Claudinesinging (to Ron’s accom-
paniment) an hour and a half
worth of songs which, many feel,
have not been given their due
exposure in the university for
some time. The performers‘ reper-
toire includes show times (‘flf He
Walked Into My Life,” “Never-
land”), old standards (“Someone
To Watch Over Me"), contem-
porary ‘sofl‘ material- in short,
the kind of breezy, pleasant music
which often provides ii welcome
contrast to the heavier sounds
Currently prevalent The bonus. of
course, is that all of the material
will be performed by Cliiudine, who
has already begun to establish a
reputation as one of the brightest
young singers in the Capital Dis-
triet.

The duo-with Claudine pruvidirtg
the voice and the looks, and Ron
the arrangements, accompaniment
and dozens of other details— be-
gan working together two years
ago. Ronnie, a gifted and versatile
musician in his own right who hits
been studying piano for twelve
years, was quick to see the poten-
tial of the lovely Miss Cassan who,
in her words,“always loved to
sing”; they have been rehearsing
and performing war since. As a
matter of historical record, their
first appearance was at a Dutch

"Sweet Sounds" and

Quad Guitar Cup; since then
they’ve appeared at the Village
Gate in New York, the Colonic
Coliseum, Stone Ends, Raffaeles,
the Jewish Community Center,
and innumerable cast parties and
benefits. When Claudine got the
lead in PETER PAN, Ron was
there too, as assistant musical
director, and that now-legendary
show brought the due “a great
deal more exposure and confi-
dence," as well as adding some
delightful new songs to their
repertoire,

Claudine isscheduled to graduate
in June, Ron a year llttt‘l', Al-
though they plan to continue
working together, they're still not
quite sure what it will all lead to.
In Ron’s words, “Music today is
branching out into many different
forms. It’s il return to the old
style of folk, such as with Carole
Kingn It's a throw-back to the big
bands, Le. Chicago," Difficult to
say where music itself is going;
but we may be sure that wherever
it is the team of Cassatt and Abel
will be following it for some times
with their own special blend of
talent, vitality and charm. In the
meantime, we can savor them
tonight.

lncideiitally, tonight‘s concert.
will not consist entirely of music.
Ron is scheduled to perform card
tricks, while Claudine will demon-
strate techniques of the Ballet
IIusse,

sexual contact With each other. As

Frankonis puts it:

“I had been writing up to that
time things I felt were social
commentary, dealing with char-
acters who were consciously ster-
eotypes...and there had been de-
veloping in me the belief that
‘good’ theatre has as its basic
element the development of real
characters who come across as real
people (which is not to say I think
the only style of theatre is
realism.) PORNOGRAPHIC was
my first really conscious attempt
to create characters who were
real."

Although PORNOGRAPHIC
PLAY docs deal with sex, it does
so in a tasteful and light matter;
iLs content could hardly be called
"explicit." Wherefore, then, the
title'.’: "I was still not completely
free from my penchant for social
comment, In some ways the play
does comment on pornography-
to some people the thought of
two unmarried people going to
bed is pornographic Where do
you draw the line‘.‘ When- does
pornography begin'.‘

“A reaction to nudity in theatre
was at its height (while the play
was being written) Some thought,
I suppose, that it (nudity) was a
release. But more important than
shownig‘lwo naked birdies on
stage in the act of sex is showing
llIl' relationship surrounding that
act Maybe I was saying in my
own way that that act is ii fleeting
moment, Illt‘l't'ly an end product
of something richer."

When asked if the play had
something to do with the Love
,S'lrrrv phenomenon the parallels

said,"I haven't read the book or
seen the film, so I'm not qualified
to comment on that...but I am
really concerned about the fact
that in our day and agewe’re so
embarrassed and so negative about
emotions that might be called
"sentimental.H We’re all so
damned scientific and sophis-
ticated. What's wrong with things
that are sentimental" no, I shOUId
say, things imbued with softemo-
tions? What's wrong with our
being moved by them?“

Frankonis has written ten or
twelve short plays, among them A
PIECE OF CAKE, NOMAN, and
THE GRAPE AND COBALT
ASSAULT, which all premiered
here, and has since completed his
first really-full length work,
SWEET SLEEP FOR UNCLE
CHARLES, The latter play en-
tered into his comments when he
was asked if there was one specific
suggestion or message he feels the
younger generation should be con-
scious of:

"I hate to answer this question,
because it's difficult to respond to
it without sounding glib...but
maybe the answer is in this “new
direction" in the way I’m
writing, Ultimately the only
thing that really matters in any
person‘s life is his relationships
with other people“ trying to find
a way, perhaps, so that there can
be satisfactoty relationships in
couples without either personim
prising himself on the other, I
think a line in my new play sums
it up without being glib:

"What's important is the contact
‘bctween two or three or more...
With nobody wanting anything
more for himself than IIIt' nther's
able to give. Hill the other has to
give. something'”
