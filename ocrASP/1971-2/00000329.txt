when the facts are
basically alike, it also allows all
defendants to present their cases,
retains fairness to all parties, and
retains the context of the
incident within which the alleged
infraction(s) took plac e. See
Section lVA, lk for additional
information.

Group hearings by no means
predispose the hearing board to
render the same judgment for
each defendant. Each shall be
judged on the facts of his/her
particiaption in the incident. and
not by the actions of others who
were involved.

in the case where one or more
of the defendant requests a
private hearing while the otliere
desire a public hearing, the public
would only be excluded during
the testimony or cross- examina-
tion of those requesting the
private hearing. (See Section iVA.
lk and Section N. tilt.

defendant has been given vtablc
alternatives to the date ot his
