The Big Feed

by Don Catterson
An ASP Feature
Minneapolis (CPS) — “One good
turn deserves another," said a
beet-red Art Linkletter. The
occasion was the “Big Feed” -
“A Salute to the the President” it
was billed — a tribute to mono-
poly capital it was.

An estimated [0,000 of the
country’s fattest of fat-cats paid
$500-a-plate to attend last week's
Republican fund-raiser which was
held simultaneously in 20 cities
around the country and addressed
by President Nixon on closed cir-
cuit color TV.

Before the evening was over we
were addressed by such right-wing
notables as Art Linkletter, Bob
Hope, Ronald Reagan John
Mitchell, and Charles Percy.

Being a long-time radical politi-
cal activist, it was a rather bizarre
place to ﬁnd myself. The festivi-
ties were at the Radison South
Hotel, an elegant new hotel and
convention center on the outskirts
of the wealthy Minneapolis
suburb of Edina.

I was drawn to this event for
several practical reasons. I won-
dered what the hell people did at
a $500-a-plate dinner (a sum that
takes me over 2 months to earn)
and my miserable CPS paycheck
had been lost in the mail a week
ago and cOupled with a $30 traffic
fine for picking up a hitchhiker,l
was broke and didn‘t have much
left to eat.

My sharp eye for news netted
me two ham sandwiches and a
juicy at a SlO-a-plate DFL fund
raiser addressed by Ted Kennedy
just three days before so I ﬁgured
I could really rake in the goodies
at a $500-a-plate Republican
dinner.

After hassling most of the day I
managed to wrangle passage
through those invisible gates and
was granted entrance by a repre-
sentative of the Minnesota Ree
publican State Central Com-
mittee. “Come to the door at 9,"
he said, “and ask for me. I'll see
that you get in."

And Me

I learned the good news at 4:30
in the afternoon and was elated to
know I wouldn’t be faced with
dining on Purina Oat Chow and
rice again that night. In fact, I was
so wild-eyed ecstatic, I dug out
my brown pin-striped suit which I
hadn’t worn since my Uncle
John‘s funeral in August ’70.

At 8:50, making sure l was on
time, I parked my $200 rusted-
out Lenny Auto Speciali-of-the-
Week amid the chauffeur-driven
Lincolns and Cadillacs in the
Radison Hotel parking lot.

Arriving at the entrance pre-
cisely at 9, I quickly found my
way to the press table. But to my
absolute horror everyone had
ALREADY EATEN. I was,
however, afforded dessert of 2
tablespoons of ice cream with
strawberry and coconut topping.

This, I was to ﬁnd, pretty well
set the temper of the evening.
While diners in other cities were
treated with such guest speakers
as John Wayne, Jackie Gleason,
and Martha Mitchell, we were
stuck with Senator Peter
Dominick (ft-Colo.) who called
Nixon “the most exciting leader
to come along this century."

Next on the bill was ex-
Minnesota Governor Harold
LaVander. He said he was often
asked what he thinks about being
out of office. His reply: "It isn't
as taxing."

Then followed two disc jockeys
from a local radio station who did
an imitation of the “Ma Perkins"
radio show.

It wasn‘t a fast evening.

The color-cast began at l0 p.m.
with Art Linkletter in Los
Angeles. The color was terrible.
Linkletter‘s face was beet-red —
just as if he had just stepped from
a hot sauna.

His clumsy humor was hardly,
amusing. “President Nixon lit-i
about to give birth to a new
prosperity if he can get past
labor."

Ronald Reagan was next and he
spoke menacineg of "the three
years of Camelot” which he said
fostered “false claims iind denial
of reality.‘

Soon after, John Mitchell wan-
dered out and said that “in less
than a year Nixon hits led the
country out of a crisis."

in Chicago we saw a jaundice-
yellow Bob Hope 5in “Nobody‘s
here because they like to cutout."

Thereafter lllinois Senator
Charles Percy and Govornor
Ogilvio were trotted out to

quickly utter some tin-noteworthy
platitudes and to introduce the
Prcsitlt'lit.

Richard Nixon came on and
didn't say much of interest either.
At his right sat W. Clemont Stone.
the right-wing billionaire and pro
ponent of Positive Mental Atti-
tude, whose millions helped put
Nixon in the White House in [968.
He congratulated Vice President
Agnew on his birthday (but didn’t
sing Happy Birthday to him) and
himself for organizing the most
financially-successful fund raiser

in the history of American
politics.

Noting that Saturday
Amchitka nuclear test was

strongly criticized by environ~
mentalists, he said, “Unless we
have an adequate program to de-
fend the United States we won’t
have any environment to pro-
tect."

That comment provoked the
strongest and sustained applause
of the evening from the
Minneapolis audience. Nixon then
dangled the prospect of China’s
millions buying American pro-
ducts before the now-glazed eyes
of his wealthy audience. I'm sure
that those cholesterol-laden hearts
of the wheat magnates in my
Minneapolis crowd were gyrating
wildly at that prospect. They had
just unloaded $50 million worth
of wheat on the Russians last
week and I expect that the mere
notion of trading with China must
have sent them reeling.

In closing, Nixon called on those
present to speak up for America.
"We need your leadership. We
need you to stand up in your
community and speak up for
America now that it is under
attack from forces at home and
iibroad. History is strewn with the
wreckage of civilizations that have
fallen at the height of their
powcr.,.thesc civilizations fell bc<
cause their leadership was weak. I
am confident that America‘s
lenders will meet the challenge of
leadership."

The chning was soon over and,
still wciik from having sung
Amcri,cn the Beautiful with
Richard Nixon, 1 left amid the
diamond-laden old ladies ripping
off the flowers from the tiiblc
settings and the black chauffeurs
jockeying for positions in front of
the hotel.

iind was arrested two blocks away
for having it burned-out headlight.

What Ever
Happened

To Eb Howard

by Brian Carr

Lately, not much has been heard about Eb
Howard as to its accomplishments and its status as it
practical and academic reality.

For those who aren’t familiar with the Ebenezer
Howard Housing Project, a brief review of its nature
is in order. Last spring, the Eb Howard Project was
organized with the goal of developing an off-campus
reisdence area which would provide inexpensive
housing for students and low-income persons in the
development area. The idea was to form a “total
community" which would provide for academic and
cultural enrichment for all persons involved. Also,
the students who aided in the planning of the
community would receive academic credit for their
work.

Indeed, at the present time there are some ﬁfteen
students working for academic credit from indepen-
dent study on the Ebenezer Howard Housing
Project. However, it appears that their work will not
be utilized because of a lack of funds. Originally,
students in Eb Howard had hoped to buy one or
more houses which they could renovate and rent to
students at a low cost. But because of the budget
cuts, SUNY “freeze”, etc., there have been no such
purchases and with the recent rejection of the
Transportation Bond Issue, there is virtually no
chance of funds being allocated to Eb Howard. This
of course, has led to disillusionment among the
students and faculty involved in Eb Howard and the
idea of forming a community has been nearly
forgotten. However, in an attempt to continue the
quest for improved, inexpensive, off-campus
housing, the board of directors for Eb Howard
formed Student Dwellings Incorporated.

The goal of Student Dwellings Inc. is to provide
off-campus housing for students and faculty that
can compete with downtown landlords who charge
exorbitant rental rates. One goal of Student Dwel-
ling's president, Mr. Joseph Scaring, is to have new
lost-cost housing available for students by the fall
semester of 1972. This goal could possibly be
realized in the form of mobile homes on the
state-owned land along Fuller Road. Another idea
being considered, is the purchase and renovation of
the YWCA in downtown Albany. However, like Eb
Howard, the success of Student Dwellings Inc. is
dependent on whether or not it can obtain funds. in
January, they will file an application for financial
aid from HUD through College Housing Assistance.
If funds are not received, there is virtually no hope
for improved off-campus housing in the near future.

So, in effect, Student Dwellings Inc. is replacing
the housing aspect of Eb Howard (with modified
goals), while Eb Howard becomes more and more
discrete. Also, ii faculty member of the board of
directors for Eb Howard (which is the same board
of directors for Student Dwellings lnc.) stated that
the Ebenezer Howard Housing Project can not and
probably won‘t continue as iin academic reality
Thus, for all practical purposes, Eb Howard is
defunct. Now we can only hope that Student
Dwellings lnC. doesn’t meet the same fiitc.

Second Role

To the Editor:

Why does the Univursily con-
tinue to house students in resin
dence halls they consider to be
second-rate? Alumni Quad has
been treated as inferior for so
long that this treatment can only
be construed as it reflection of the
attitude of the administration, It’s
really leL’ for either closing these
dorms or treating them as equals
with the uptown dorms. Just ii
few of the complaints:

1) Uptown security may be
poor, but downtown's is com-
pletely nonexistent. Onc ex-
iimplc— over the Rush l-liishiinna
holidays a room was broken into
and over $300 worth of goods
were stolen, When security was
notified they said that they
couldn't do anything about it
because they were supervising the
parking for a football game, This
apparently was more important
than breaking and entering and
grand larceny on that quiid down
there. ’l‘hcfts have been con-
tinuously increasing here, too,

.1) Depending on the bus is it
part of the daily routine on
Alumni and most people adjust to
it willi time. This year, with the
new bus schedules, the busscs run
more frequently, but then- are
fewer busscs at ouch time. This
means that it differs from last
year in thiil ll student had to wait
l'ifit-t-ii or twenty minutes to get ii
bus to cities, but there were two or
llll'l‘t' bosses arrivmg simul»
tniieously to assure him that he
Would actually get there. Now,
with the new system, the liusscs
run t-vory lt‘ll minutes or so, but
only out~ bus at it lllnt'. This
means tliiil at rush hours Wlll'll the
one bus iirrchs ovar half-full, the
seventy-five people waiting at the
Quad stop can't all gel on and at
least half will cud up waiting for
the next has and being late for
their classes. This, coupled with
the annoyances of the new route
nticussitiiting ii walk dowti ll
poorly lit street. at night and tho
fact that the lust bus loaves up»
town iil [2:40 a.in., considerably
curlicr tluin last year, make riding
the bosses cvcn mom disagreeable.

3) The undergraduate dorms
Wcrc scheduled to be rckcyed two
years ago and we’re still waiting
for it. to happen while many mas.-
ter keys to the dorms arc in the
possession of people who have no
right to them.

ti) Uptown practically every
suite has a dustmop for the stu-
dents to use to clean their rooms.
Waterbury Hall has two beat-up
brooms for the use of its 300
residents. This may sound pica-
yune, but try waiting for three
weeks until you can clean the

floor in your room and see how
petty it is.

Alumni Quad residents pay
higher room rates than any other
SUNYA residents. Sure, the
rooms are bigger, but we’re out
off from the campus, plagued by
gangs of kids from the neighbor-
hood, and without even token
security. So we send petitions to
security and write letters to the
ASP. But until anything changes
(and knowing this University it
will take awhile) I advise my
fellow Alumni Quad residents to
steal it dustmop from State.

Bad Breath!

To the Editor:

Kindly permit me some space in
your paper to bring to light, one
of the unpleasant problems that
faces ii line-checker (dinner). Most
studL'an sleep late on Sundays
and conic to dinner with all sorts
of scents on their breaths. l uppcul
to those concerned, to spend an
extra few minutes with mouth~
wash before coming down for
dinner. One is bad enouin , but
several scores adds up.

Yours truly,

Cars Are Beautiful

To the Editor:

There in no inherent. reason why
parking on the stnnoocovcrcd areas
adjacent to the crisscrosaing ser-

vice roads_should not be per-
mitted to students, faculty and
staff without regard for status,
need or esthetics.

As currently provided, parking
facilities are egregiously incon-
venient for university purposes
and adherence to a system which
everybody rejects can only end up
by fostering the rejection of much
more than simply the parking
system.

The world has moved beyond
the classic ivory tower set midst
fields of bucolic greens. Today's
university must be part of now,
especially in its working aspects.
Its studentr are no longer simply
adolescents but often mature
people engaged quite seriously in
many [aspects of life,- with de-
creasing; energy reserves to face
yet another and totally useless
social constraint. The constraint is
useless because the space is there.
Just why beauty has to be admin-
istratively deﬁned as grass sur-
rounded by cars instead of cars
surrounded by grass escapes me,
especially when status hierarchies
are so blatantly involved‘andlspace
so patently available.
