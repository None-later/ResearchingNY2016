The Continuing Saga of Promotio

 

 

 

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

 

The system of Promotion and Continuing Ap-
pointment is one of the "weakest areas in the
educational system," said Dr. Paul Wheeler. Asso-
ciate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.
Many students, in agreement with Wheeler, believe
that one way to strengthen the system would be to
increase the inﬂuence of student opinion on the
decision-making process.

Continuing Appointment [also called tenure or
full term appointment for an indeﬁnite period) and
promotion policies are outlined in the University
Senate Council’s Guidelines, hi this outline the
Council recognizes student opinion as “a valuable
source of information since they attend classes
regularly and observe the instructor when he is not
under pressure (as he may be If one of his colleagues
is present)."

Professor Harold Cannon, Chairman of the Senate
Council on Promotion and Continuting Appoint-
ments, agrees that student opinion Is important.
however. he cautioned studans against being used
as "pawns." According to Cannon,  .if a teacher
isn't a scholar he knows it and may become political
to amass student support." He added that boycotts,
sit-ins, or strikes only would st‘rvc to “turn-off" thc
(Touncd

went on to say that "student evaluations play .I w-ry
important role [in determining tenure and pro-
motion decisions], but it Is only our of ihe inputs,"

appeal from non-renewal of term appointment.”
Cannon explained that the department doesn't have
to explain a decision taken on appointment and
“there is nothing that we [the Council] can do
about it.” There have been many argumean against
such a procedure, but Cannon said that "the
Council will hear close to 200 cases [concerning
Promotion and Tenure] this year; it would be
impossible to hear all cases.”

Looking back to March 1970, Cannon cited the
Gerry Wagner controversy as one case that wasn't
heard by the Council. The renewal of appointment
for Wagner, former Rhetoric St Public Address
instructor. had been denied spurring great student
reaction. At that time students found ifdiflicult to
obtain the reasons for non-renewal since Wagner‘s
case was one involving term appointment. Cannon
said that this year’s decisions concerning Waterman
and Rhodes. both from the Psychology Department,
Will not be heard by the Council.

However. In .1” other cases involving Promotion
and Continuing :\pp()lntml'nl, the Council does
have 4 voice. But the procz-ss is a long one.
