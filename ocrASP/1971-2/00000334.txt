Fulton-Montgomery CC with 76 points, Lehman
College with 54, Columbia with 48, and, lastly, the

Danes with a paltry 36 points.

The Great Dane Relays, held in the University
swimming pool, consisted of eight relay races, plus a
diving contest. Albany's Mermen did not show
much at all during the meet. However, the Danes are
young and inexperienced, with only three seniors on

the team.

Albany finished last in three relays, fifth twice,

and came in fourth twice. The only showing of the
Danes that was good at all, came in the SOD-yard
Backstroke Relay, where Albany ﬁnished second to
New Paltz.

‘RPI put on an impressive show as they won the
first three relays. Thcy finished ﬁrst in the 400-yard
Freestyle,

3 O 0-ya rd Breaststroke, BOO-yard

Butterﬂy, and the 400-yurd Medley Relay.

Second place finisher New Pultz finished first in
the 300-yurd Backstroke Relay, and in the ZOO-yard
Medley. Fulton-Montgomery finished first two
times, and Lehman finished first once.

Albany's swimmers‘ next meet is the Plattsburgh
Relays, at Pltittsburgh, Dec. 4. The Danes parv

ticipntc in their first dual meet Dec, ll, here against A

Plattsburgh.

defense put in its third solid per-
formance in a row. The win
evened Albany's record at 4-4 and
left the Pace Setters at 2-6.

Pace tried a multitude of fur-

Dane goal line, After a scoreless
first quarter, Albany got moving

lil yard loss back to the Seller 5.

yard return by Boggs, gave the
Danes the hall on the Pace 28.

Early in the third quarter, Boggs

for Albany was an absence of

Big Al on Sports

Alumni Quad:
Where Men Are Men

Alan D. Abbey

Yes, folks! There is a downtown campus. Not all on-campus dwellers
live in Ed Stone's (Ioncrt-tc City, and to prove it. to themselves and to
the rest of the nnivvrsity, the men of Alden and Waterbury Halls
decided to knock the crap out of mll‘h ()Lhur on lllt' field of honor. The
gridiron

'I‘ncklc football was the game. No equipment, This was not to be a
game for just anybody. The days prior to the game were filled with
stories of bravado designed to strike fear into the hearts of the
opposition. The night before, at a keg, spirit(s) were high, The gods of
sport were invoked to ruin destruction on the other team.

Game time approached after Sunday's dinner, The field in the
middle of Alumni Quad was slowly filling up with many cleats,
sweats, bodies, and footballs. The number of headbands designed to
hold back bushy heads of hair was too high to count.

A fairly substantial crowd was on hand, each side highly partisan,
and slightly hungover from the night before. Speculation on the
winner was rampant, even though the odds had been set. The early
morning line favored Waterbury by three points. The spread rose to
six, HS Bill the Book survuyed the size of Waterbury '1; team.

Waterbury kicked off and Alden set the tone of the game by
promptly fumbling in the cndzonc to give Waterbury a 6-0 lead. The
next series of downs was just as disastrous for Alden, us Waterbury
converted an interception into another score. Two more Alden
turnovers were turned into scores quickly, and midway through the
first half the score stood at its final spot, 24-0 Waterbury.

The game was rough and tumble and the action on the field was
surprisingly good and melting. Each team played hard and wanted to
win. After a particularly hard series of downs, this reporter gathered
these words from a battered combatant on the sidelines. “We're
losing, so we ltave to play dirty.” This game though was, of course,
played in the spirit ol‘just good clean fun.

The first half ended and each team retreated to neutral corners to
lick their wounds and dew-lop ncw strategies where needed. The
st‘t‘tilul hall" was somewhat. shortened as darkness descended early,
courtesy of many dark clouds and much rain. The gridiron had been
reduced to a steamy swamp.

The crowd dispersed, ttiilil the only people left were a few tliehni‘ds,
including yours truly, were there to witness the end llowuvur, the
gnmc wasn't really over, and was replayed many times that night over
a keg of beer (which is the most fun of all).
