traditionally known as the weekend evenings when AUGH, , “kt H g {Raga/D1;

those students remaining on campus search des-
perately for entertainment, group for some di-
version from calculus and analytic geometry. Red,
yellow, and blue sloppily written rexographed signs
seen taped on pillars draw us to the Lecture Centers
for some often good movie-viewing. Others, more
courageous perhaps, are attracted to the brightly—lit
Performing Arts Center (contrasting sharply with
the Saturday night darkness of the Library at the
other end of the Podium) to see what cultural
pursuits are awaiting eager audiences.

The title “Pornographic Play“ served as ample
enough bait, necessitating the turning away of
crowds at both the 7:30 and 9:00 p.m. perfor-
mances at the Studio Theatre last Saturday night.
The basic element of the play centers around the
first sexual encounter of a young man and woman.
this is in itself fairly touchy and difficult to handle
theatrically without falling prey to poor taste or the
utmost prudishncss, but perhaps the story failed to
succeed because it was in too much of a middle
state between these two.

The opening scene was quite good in attracting the-
audience to the little comedy about to happen. We

Enter Gray, our virginal hero. The dialogue which
then ensues for approximately fifty minutes be-
tween this pair is an attempt at realism which falls.
They both refuse to directly refer to the sexual act,
and therefore exchange all sorts of nonsense vaguely
alluding to intercourse. It is comic not because it is

is contrived. Their conversa-

tions are simple and artificial. The phoniness stilts
the actors to a degree but they try very well to
the fact that they are both naive
young innocents, not yet jaded, only just learning of
and glimpsing the moments of "true love" which lie
ahead for them. Joseph Balfior‘s direction aids
Robin Sagon and Robert Hebert successfully.

FSA’s Cooley Dismisses

Last month the ASP ri-ported
that any chance ltobcrl Cooley

rates approved by the FSA Board
of Directors had appreciably
diminished in the face of in»
creased student, administi'iitivc,
and even FSA officials' opposi-
tion.

Monday afternoon, Robert
Cooley di'oppt'd his request for a
price hike. The move was pi‘ol)‘
ably the most significant action
taken iii the afternoon l“S./\ meet

decisions; they meet monthly.)
This was the meeting hcld Mon~
day afternoon,

All members of tlic iiiiiVersity
community had the right to
attend. Few did, and this sparked
the first disagreement between the
undergraduate student repre-
scnlatives and the rest of the
membership board

lloiirs before the meeting bcgan,
SA President Mike Lampert had
sent ii memorandum to President
Bt‘iit'lt‘i, who is chairman of thi-
corporation's Board of Directors.
Lampcrt conli-ndi-(l lliiil "siiici-
duc notice (of thc meat ing)|ias iiol
l)t',l'li given . . . I do respectfully
request that you (Bcnczi-t) iiol
i-onVi-iii- tod'v illcgal inccting
iiiid forthwith si-l ii ncw llilll' for ii
joint nit-cling of thc members and
Board,"

l.4ilnlpl‘l‘l hascd his argument on
thc fact that last month, the
nicmlwrship passed a motion to
open meetings to NW university
community, and to give ten days
notice of their meetings.

Chandler Stein, FSA attorney,
denied Lampcrt‘s charge and
claimed that notice had indeed
been given through news stories
and a graffiti announcement in the
ASP. Discussion ensued over
whether this constituted “due
notice" and whether the spirit of
last month's motion had been
violated.

After much bickering, the mo-
tion came to ii vote with Benezel
observing that "We had, indeed,
not fulfilled the proper spirit (of
last month's mot.ioii)," and with
an admonishment to see that
nothing similar would occur in thc

 

future.

The members voted Itin’i-‘z to
meet. with Bl'llt‘ll'l noting that
"It was unfortunate that faculty
and students were split on the
vote.“ (Faculty support carried
the measure.) The students liiid
suffered thcir first di-fi-al of the
day.

COOLE Y 'S PR OPUS/i I.

With the meeting officially
underway, minutes were approved
and a Chairman (Benezet) and
President (John Hartley) of the
Corporation elected. This Wits a
virtual certainty, since the by-laws
mandate their election.

Then, Robert Cooley came be-
fore the board to announcr that
Arnold Colon had been named the
new bookstore manager, and to
present. proposals to the Directors.
(‘oion's appointment was greeted
willi little argument; his creden-
tials Weri- checked thoroughly by
management and students.

(Yonley‘s proposals and 'iniincitil
hrciikdown, however, were a dif»
l'crenl matter. the urged that lllt‘
Directors do the following:

"‘Closc lllt' l’atrooii Room
llvt‘lllnﬂl‘it

—Closc lhil Colonial Quad cash
liiic.

m-Convert the Brubachcr snack
bar to ii vending operation.

-Continue the “Special Func-
tions" part of the FSA program.

—-Continuc. the Campus Center
Snack Bar and Cafeteria.

—~Continue the Brubucher and
Hustcd cafeteria.

Even though some of the pro-
posals were in line with student
wishes, tempers flared. The
Directors had received Cooley‘s
proposals late Wednesday after—
noon aiid so had little time to
study them; the membership
board was never given the infor-
mation at all, even lliougli thc
purpose of having a combined
meeting was to evaluate Cooley 's
proposals and study the Campus
Center food operation.

The undergraduates (and some
grad students) wanted the meeting
recessed to study the information.
But Cooley and l'liirtley conten-
ded that iiction to cut costs need-
ed to be taken immediately be-
cause of the financial situation of
the corporation.
