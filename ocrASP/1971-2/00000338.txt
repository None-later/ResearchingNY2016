Dear Sir'
I read with interest the recent

editorial about the (.‘ommunity

Service program at SUNYA.
Naturally. I can only respond with
authority about the program as it
functions here at Albany Medical
Center Hospital. Far from “baby-
sitting" out in the community.
the sturlents assigned to us are
placed in areas where they are
expected to contribute. During
the three semesters We haVe had
students Jlfi. then 86. and now
7| young men and women there
have. of course. been situations In
which a part of the volunteer ltil)
has been filing. answering the
phone. or lab glassware washing.
Even these. however. have been
much needed by our hospital.
which like all others. does not
have unlimited funds to hire all
the personnel we need. Also. these
chores do afford the student a
chance to see how a hospital
functions.

For most of our students. their
assignments are in their field or
interest. and we try our best to
give them a real leiiriiing situation.
Chemistry and biology majors
often work in laboratories learn
ing how these disciplines are
brought to bear on patient Ill
nesses and malfunctionings. StK'r

Frost Wrong

To The Editor.

In the ASP of Friday. Nov. l9.
l97l there was an opinion ex-
pressed by Michell Frost. We feel
compelled to respond to that
opinion. As members of the
.‘s'iiicct/‘irc staff we are very sensi-
tive to the tendency of certain
people to attribute Siacetfi're to
Jack Schwartz and Jack Schwart‘l.
only. Jack is a member of our
staff but definitely not the only
member. It is not Jack‘s paper.

Mr. Frost talks about anti-
intellectualism iii the new left. To
support hi atemi-nt he uses a lot
.it' generalities such as the left
wants to politi ‘.e the university.
The university is and always has
been political. 'l‘bc uniVersity has
always been a research center for
government (most often defense)
funded research. Universities also
have a purpose to help prepare
youngsters for a profession or
fitting them in Jobs It is poli‘

 

  

lically. at least has a tendency of
being supportwe ol' the govern
lllt'lll. 'l‘he univvrsity also provides
political advisors sitclt as llt'ill'\'
Kisst‘tlgt‘l‘ It Is .i mistake to say
the left is trying to politiciv the
university it is already political.
we Just want to change the direct
am.

Mr. l’rost doesn't even mention
the theme of Jack's article in the.
ASP, He doesn't attack argu-
ments. he attacks people. That is
most anti»inte|lectiiii|. In closing
We wish to say even though we are
on the Siccclfirc staff it doesn't
mean the ASP isn't our paper
Mitch wants to take that away
from us.
