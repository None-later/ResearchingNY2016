HOOpsiers Open Season With Loss

by Bill Heller

The Albany basketball season

kicked off on a sour note
Wednesday night, as Williams
held on to a lead they had
sustained tlle entire game to
defeat the Danes. The dill'cren»

ces between it tough loss and a
good win become evident upon
examination of the statistics,
Williams outshot Albiiny from
the ﬁeld,rind foulline, and outre-
bounded the Danes. Despite the
stats, the game was almost
pulled out by a determined A|~
bany team. but the time just
run out.

Williams took an early H
point lead and lit'lll ii for
three-fourths ol‘ Lht‘ first half,
lltrelltt'iiillu to bust it wide-
open. in doing this, the-y ri-l.-‘(l

ample 01' how to hold for the
last shot, as reserve guard Bub
Rosse canned it jumper with 2

Two baskets were exchanged,
and the Danes found them-
selves with the ball, trailing
70-66 with 1:38 to go. They
hurried downcourt, shot,
missed, but with inspirational
rebounding, managed 5 or 6 at-
tempts at the hoop to no ii-
vail. Kenny Bate made it free
throw for Williams with 30 sec-
tintls left, to make it 71-66.
Miller came right brick [or the
Danes, hitting a jumper ten
seconds later. The clincher

Bate di'ibhlerl the length of the
court (through it l‘ierce Albany

liiy-up to make it 73-68.

A disappointing loss, but for
the Danes, Quattroct'lii hit for

passes as he played i'loiii' gener-
