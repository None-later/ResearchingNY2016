The constant increase in per
capita generation of solid
waste, stimulated by production
growth and coupled with a ra-
pidly increasing population con-
centrated in urban areas, is res-
ponsible for the nation’s pres-
ent environmental crisis. In-
creased demand and the in-
creased production to meet it
are the basic causes of in-
creased pollution. This is con-
firmed by the fact that the
real output of goods and ser-
vices in the U.S.:h'as grown as
much since 1950 as it grew in

the entire period from the
landing of the Pilgrims up to
1960.

translated into more junk cars,

cans, bottles, plastics, fly ash,
and paper products. If the
present production of solid

waste is not managed, what of
the future?

Solid waste falls into three
major source categories. The
ﬁrst is urban refuse, which in-
cludes domestic, commercial,
municipal, and industrial waste
products; the second category
contains the. mineral waste
which results from mining and
mineral processing operations;
and the last, agricultural waste,
includes farming, animal, and
crop waste.

A further breakdown of ur-

lion generates about 1100 mil-
lion tons each year. This in-
cludes 60 billion cans, 36 bil-
lion bottles, 58 million tons of
paper and paper products, 4
million tons of plastics, over 1
million abandoned automobiles,
mountains of demolition debris,
180 million tires, and countless
millions of tons of refrigerators,

The Odyssey
of a Vietnam Vet

by AI Seliia

The red hair rests carelessly on
his shoulders. The heard is full.
The tie-dyed shirt, bell bottoms
and bare feet could belong to any
street person.

But Ron Podlaski, 25, is not just
anyone. For two years ago, Ron
was a Sergeant in the U.S. Green
Berets. And now, after n painful
radicalization, he is a regional
co-ordinator for “Vietnam Vete-
rans Against the War."

"1 went into the army to be
important," he explains. “I was
like Nommn Nobody. Well, 1 had to
be somebody. I had to stand
out...l w'unted to go see what it
was all about, win some medals,
and look good.”

’30 Ron went down to his draft
board, enlisted, volunteered for
the U.S. Special Forces and duty
in Southeast Asia, and braved thi-
rigors of basic training. Unfor-
tunately, he possessed a police
record, a fact his superiors over-
looked until the last iiiomciit.
Upon completing his lraining,
they denied him clearance because
he was thought to be n securin
risk.

Ron Podlnski is not one lo be
easily outdone. He wrote to (ion
gressmen; bndgcred his superiors,
"I'm not going to spend the rcsl
of my days in the Special Forces
picking up pine coiieiiat Fort
Bragg,” he told them. Under the
pressure, the army relented.

Immediately, he volunteered for
duty in a special operalions group

‘ assigned the task of crossing the

Luotiiin border and conducting
hit-nnd-run aids, ambushes and
spying operations on suspected
North Vietnamese base camps.
This, back in 1968, when the
Pentagon was still “Ling tlini
U.S. troops were observing Laos'
status as n neutral country.

to give top security clearance in

For the next ten months. until
early 1969, he served in the Lao-
tian countryside with a six man
team out ofradio Contact for long
periods and surrounded by North
Vietnamese. “We planted sensory
devices...“ was an intclligcnce
thing." It was also the first time
Podlnski was to be confronted
with death. “I was scared, really
scared. It wasn’t just being afraid
of dying. But I realized I had

“l was on a hate trip in Vietnam
for ten months. I learned to hate
Vietnamese. Then I came back
here trying to love everybody and
I fucking can't do it...I can't relate
to this scummy society we live in,
to the whole profit motive
thing..."

“l‘m totally, totally living in the
wrong country. I can't relate to
the people or the culture. I can't
see loving material things that
can't love you back."

Upon his return, he was arrested
(for, of all things, driving with ii
faulty muffler) and his court
appearance provided :1 further
spark. “i couldn't relate to having
a loud muffler when l liiid just
killed people (in Nam), 1 keep
trying to full ihcni that."

Now, Ron concentrates all of his
energies into stopping a war in
which he volunteered to servc. He
hasn't bnd n regular job in two
ycnrs (“I don't feel comfortable
with more iliaii forly cents in my
pocket") and hopes to oliiain n
pension from the govcrnmcnl on
menial grounds.

“The giiy I lived with said to
me: ‘ln all hum-sly, you're wac-
ky.‘ And 1 am, I'm crazy. So il'l
can convincr- [he giiVi-riimcnl to
give me some money, wlial the
hell, I'll lake ii."

Whal remains now for Ron Pod-
liiski, cx-Grecn Berct, is an altered
reality and an nlniosl gi-ncral crav»
ing to find some peace of mind.
The combat medals (Vietnam
Campaign and Servicr- Medals;
National Defense Medal; Bron/.0

pause, "There are too many per-
sonal hung-ups."

Nevertheless, he is optimistic. it
is couched, but if still remains.

“If you believe in peace," lion
l’odlaski claims, “you should find
the most meaningful thing you
can do, even if it's an individual
thing...helping the poor is working
for peace, loo, "

“Right now, young people are
nice...tlie junior-high school kids
are nicer. The elementary slicool
kids are even nicer. And Hici‘r kids
are gonnn be beautiful. And that's
the oiin hope we have."

As for himself, Ron Podliiski
still has fl way Io travel. One cnii
easily relalc to his thoughts. “The
only thing We linvc in this world is
each ollier," lie observes. “We've
gol to learn to recognize each
ollier and I'm finding that n diffi-
cull thing to do in this culture.
But 1 have never been happier
with myself than riglii now. I'm
happy just living my life the way I

communal thing" where he can
live, relate, and grow with others.
The strain of the past few years is
showing and, in any event, Ron is
scarcely an organization mil".

"1 don't like being tied down,"
he confesses. Thai goes for any
organization, even this one (Viet-
nam Vets)."

And now he is nearly finished,
“You now,H he says, “it’s not
Vietnam that makes us commi\
these war crimes. We‘re (Ichuinnn~
ized when we go over there...We
go there having the framework of
an animal. Vietnam just brings it
out, that’s all."

“Most people in this country,
given the same circumstances and
the

excuses, would do same
thing."
The conclusion one draws in

clear: Ron, like many others. will
soon be leaving this society to try
to build something better.

lie is silent now, fingering the
bracelet that was given to him by
Montngnard iribesmen. A sardonic
smile crosses his lips. "Tell them

he nnys, offering an cxistenliiil
summary ilinl speaks for so many
other people's personal experi
