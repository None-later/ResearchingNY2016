Job Bias Revealed:
Job Discrimination Fought

by John Falrhall
An ASP Feature

This university is energetically

seeking to hire, for the- first
time, Blacks, other minority
group members, and women.
Prompted by a federal govern-
ment study done here last
April, the university has im-
plemented an “Affirmative Ac-
tion Prtqzriimn to break a pat-
tern of job discrimination

The study made by the De-
partment of Health, Education,
and Welfare uncovered 2-1 spe-
cific instances of job discrimi-
nation. For example, as of
Fall, 1970, of 2,241 full-time
employees in all categories,
2,135 were white. Discrimina-
tion in terms of tenure, promo-
tion, and salary was also docu-
mented (as of June, 1971):

—113 percent of the faculty
has tenure; minority group fac-
ulty members, however, com-
prise less than one percent of
the tenured faculty.

—'I‘here is only one minority
group member in t1 position of
assistant dean or higher.

—Women make up 18 percent
of the total faculty and are
found mainly in the lowr-r level
positions of instructor and as-
sistant professor.

—There is a marked pattern
of salary differentials between
men and women in nearly all
job classifications on the facul-
ty. For example, all male full
professors are higher paid than
women.

I’LA NS A NN() UN ('15!)

John Hartley, ViCc President
for Management and Planning,
has aiinounCed a policy of onc-
to-one hiring of minorities, af-
fecting all of the administrative
staff. This means that for every
white (non-minority member)
hired, a inmorily group mem-
ber is hired.

The guidelines for the Office
of Student Affairs (the largest
employer in the University Af-
fairs division), under Dean Neil
Brown, state that no fewer
than one of every three new
and vacant positions be filled
with minority members. Addi-
tionally, one of every three
positions is to be ﬁlled by a
woman.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Dr. Philip Sirotkin, Vice Pr-si-
dent for Academic Affairs, has
stated that on the academic
side there will be a net gain of
ten minority members and
women in the next academic
year.

(Another area of university
employment is the Faculty-
Student Association, but Direc-
tor Robert Cooley has been
unavailable for comment.)

The Affirmative Action Pro-
grain is under the direction of
Vicv President Hartley, but the
program’s actual administration
is in the hands of Leon
Calhoun who is directing the
Office of Equal Employemcnt
Opportunity, Calhoun is going
to make sure that past mis—
takes are not repeated, He will
help recruit minority members
and women as candidates for
jobs to, in his words, “counter
the, excuse that minority mem-
bcrs can not be found " His
office will review new job ap-
pointments made to ensure
than an honest effort is' Iii-lug
made to hire minority members
and women. Violations of the
program will he brought to thr-
altention of llartley.

The severe budget cr"is' we
are experiencing has hurt the
program. Lack of funds pre-
vents the creation of new post»
tons which could be filled
easily by minority members
and women. According in
Calhoun, “Attrition represents
the only dependable action to
get minorities in.” That means
minority members and women
will have to wait for people to
retire or to another
school (or be fired).

So the introduction of more
women, Blacks, Puerto Ricans,
and others to our university
will proceed slowly. The budget,
crisis explains that. But the
budget ci'i. s‘ does not explain
