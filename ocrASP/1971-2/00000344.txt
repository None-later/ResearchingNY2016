Central Council Urges
Registration Reforms

by Vicki Gottlich

After a long, heated debate, Central Council passed a position
statement on the pre-registration procedure. The measure, which
passed 12-6-4, urges the administration to change the current system
to make it more equitable for juniors and seniors.

Central Council chairman Rick Liese introduced the bill for student
Sandy Lofke. Lofke explained that many second semester seniors
have been closed out of classes they need for graduation and are
unable to get closed section cards. 329 students signed a petiton
which was at the Campus Cneter for only two days indicating their
support for a change in pro-registration.

Liese’s proposal originally asked the administration to change the
current alphabetical system to one in which cards are pulled in class
order. with seniors pulling first and freshmen pulling last. The, closed
section cars would be distributed on a first come, first served basis.
instead of giving seniors priority over the rest of the people on the
waiting list as is done now in many departments. Council member
Rich Friedlandcr objected, saying the proposal its stated is discrimi-
natory against. freshmen and sophomores. lt Wits argued that many
freshmen and sophomores would be closed out of courses they need
to start sequences in the dcparlmcnt Ihcy may major. l’riedlundcr
propscd an amendment. that Central Council appoint a committee of
students. faculty, and administration to make a morc equitable
rcgis ationsyslcm.

     

After further discussion on the need for seniors to get required
courses and freshman to get introductory courses to start their major.
Ralph Bt-islcr ‘ ' . .anl dean of studcnl lifc, proposed a system where
uppcr divison students draw class cards bel'orc lowerdivision students
and scniiir majors are given preference for rcquircd courses. Beisler's
amendment passed over l“l'll‘(lltln(lt'l"s and was then passed as ttn
amendment to thc wording of liiesc's original proposal

 

Grievance Report
Grit-Vance committee chairman Jody Widclitz continued to report
on the allcged racial disct'inination on the part of the E0? Student
Association durittg Minister Fari'akkan ‘s speech on November IO. The
videotapes of the speech Wt-rc replayed and, although they began
