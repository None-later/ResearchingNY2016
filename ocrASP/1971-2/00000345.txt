Shocked

To The Editor,

I was very shocked to read
the editorial in ASP against the
Community Service Project. Ei-
ther someone in ASP has a
personal problem With the Pro;-
ect or has no true conception
of what it is all about

From my pcrsonal experience
in the inner (‘in of Albany
and places such as liospil:tl~.
volunteers are badly needed
due to a lack of funds from
these places It is ri new ('UII'

in this conspiracy is the idea
to screw graduate students, and
why not? Let’s really make
them an oppressed minority.

The opening scenario finds
the GSA elite deep in thought
figuring how graduate students
pay $6800. in taXes but only
receive buck a mere 51-2000
Something Is amiss.

As the plot thickens we find
the SA and USA elite banging
heads together to figure a way
to squeeze more money out of
the Uraduaie Students. “Who

edito al comment

 

It’s been mentioned before that the TransBond defeat,
whether one liked it or not, was an omen for the future.
This University is currently operating at a minimal level of
operations. If the budget were to be sliced still further.
permanent damage becomes probable.

We could quote scare statistics, if you please. The state
stands to be at least $1 billion in the red (in fact if not
legally) and the money has to come from somewhere. The
State University is a prime candidate for such a slicing—
there have even been statements that one of the University
Centers should be closed. Albany is one of “1050 four
uniccntcrs. so the talk of cutbacks directly affects you.
