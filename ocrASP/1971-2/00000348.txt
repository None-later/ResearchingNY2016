One wonders why Mr. Jiick~

politics. Then, again, Sweet/ire is

slowly sinking into -WI.

Central Council shortly for sonic
more of my tax money ; so per-
haps Jack is trying to feel otit
some new avenues for his political
insanity.

But whatever his reasons for
writing the column, it serves to
the rest of the Uiiivcrsity com-
munity as an amazing and llllY'
roughly typical example of lllt‘

that always mzuiiigis to pcrmi-zitt-

It sot-ms only logical that tlS

larger. Fortunately. the role of the
Alumni Association has been ex-

The I 1 member Board of l)ircc-

to set up an lllllllltll alumni fund.
This (‘Illnll‘llllt‘t' will present
