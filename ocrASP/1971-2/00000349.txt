Recycle Th

by Larry Bernstein

Environmental crisis! Eco-catas-
trophe! These not too subtle
warnings do indeed suggest that
life on this planet as we know it
(or knew it) is in serious trouble it
man does not take steps to avoid
disaster, The maintenance of life
is dependent on nprecnrious eco»
logical equilibrium. which is rapid-
ly being threatened by man‘s life
style of endless consumption and
waste. Our "search and destroy"
means of existence leads us to
View the world on a take. litit not

quenchable materialistic thirst
man has assumed the role of a
parasite—devouring everything It]
his reach and giving nothing in
return. The natural baIanL'e of life
forces, which have taken millions
of years to evolve. are in the
position of being upset in the span
of a generation

There has been, hoWever, a
growing awareness among many
people ol‘ the need to take care ot’
our planet. Organizations have
sprung up everywhere. devoted to
taking action to head off an ecu
logical disaster, Scientists are
spending endless hours ol’ research
In trying to develop methods ol
grappling with our problems ol
pollution and waste. What is
needed above all this, I feel. Is a
recognition of the I'act that unless
we all adopt a responsible attitudi-

towards our Mother Earth. life for
us and our children is in serious
danger.

One of the chief ways in which
we can become responsible is
through recycling our waste pro-
ducts. Recycling emphasizes the
reuse of resources. similar to the
cycle of natural elements in our
eco-systems. By recycling our nat
urul resources. We employ a more
rational approach to livtiig, con
trary to our present "produce and
discard" existence 'l'hrimiiig
away our garbage does not solve ,
tl merely lll(ll'} the problem.

Waste paper constitutes almost
no": of our trash, The present
methods of disposing paper waste
are either to burn it. which puts
titles the air. or dtimp it In a land
t'ill. which are rapidly lit-coming

mand is being placed on ntir
forests for wood, texcecding lllt

paper appears as our only sensible
solution. it we can reclaim paper
from waste, II means that we arc
ptitliiig a less demand on our
I'orests, and dumping less waste in
our environment

reason or another. This semester,
three students, including myself,
in conjunction with Environmen-
tal Forum. have explored the pos-
sibility of instituting a system to
deal with our paper waste prob-
lem. This experience has exposed
us to the intricacies and dil‘l‘icul-
ties of implementing a positive
idea, as oppole to merely com-
plaining about the problems ol'

only one grade of paper, news-

demand for a miXed grade of
waste, which is not Very uset'ul for
