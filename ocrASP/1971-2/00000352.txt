End the Tax

One of the greater injustices perpetrated 0‘
this campus has nothing to do with the
Administration or the Faculty or even the
Legislature. The mandatory tax, supposedly
self-imposed by the student body, is entirely

the creation ofthe students themselves. S.A. groups. canyt Choose the membership b0ard_ cm” {m “V; Wu BEEN A (MD

That‘s just the point: its a intuit/tinny t.i\: you
have to pay it. like it or not. It's outiight

Each year we hold elections in which about
8% of the students vote generally for their
friends or fraternity brothers. A voluntary tax,
on the other hand, would give the students, all
students, a monetary vote. Those in power
would have to program to please the public or
face a lack of funds the next year. To us it
seems a much more democratic way of funding

tory tax for maximum effect. the shooters
can't even control what they raise. because the
University exacts its price iii control for its
tasks as bill collector.

posed to bring FSA closer to the people it
serves.

Who is a constituent member? Everyone in
the university community-«in short, you.

What does a constituent member do? That’s
just the point-—-nothing.

He can’t vote, can’t change FSA corporate
priorities, can’t make any policy decisions,

What he can do is go to the meeting and
listen to FSA Director Robert (foolcy iaki~ ,.

Grads, Beware!

To the Editor,

In reply to Paul Lieberman who misdirected
himself to the question of the proposed graduate
membership fee, I would like to stale the following:

There is no conspiracy, Paul, we just want to
decrease the student activity fee for grad students
from SEW/year lo EMU/year. We also want In provide
independent dynamic leadership for grads, not
lolti-n leadership under the aegis of the undergrad

We will only offer grads wlial they waitt offered in

IMPORTANCES

Error Correction
In a recent story about (Ientral Council and registration
reforms, the ASP mistakenly printed the name of the
student concerned. Ms. Sandy Lutfi is still interested in
student reactions, and can he reached at 45775637.

Legislative Addresses
'l'hosc interested in writing their state legislators for one
reason oranother as we have sometimes urged. please note
that names and addresses of legislators are available from
the Senate (472-8800) and the Assembly 44723100) as
