Block Camel/Togas Strike ~ '
Claim "Quota System” Used ' ‘

SYRACUSE, N.Y. AP — The six black players on Cornell Univer-
sity’s varsity basketball team boycotted the Big Red’s game Thursday
night against Syracuse in what was reported to be a protest against an

alleged quota system at Cornell for Negro athletes.

The boycotters included Cornell’s two top scorers this season,
Briant Wright, a sophomore forward from Brooklyn. and Jeff Howard,

a sophomore guard from Bridgeport. Conn.

The others were co-captain Tom Sparks, a senior forward, also from
Bridgeport; Carme' "Skeeder" Stewart, a sophomore guard from
Brooklyn; Otis Story, sophomore guard from Jamaica, N.Y. and John

Coles, it junior center from Washington DC.
In a statement, varsity couch. Jerry Luce,said:

“Six black basketball players did not make the trip to Syracuse with
the team tonight because they have questions and grievances. I plan to

discuss the situation with the rest of the squad."

Lace refused to comment beyond that statement, and u Cornell
public relations man said the couch “doesn't want to say anything
that might jeopardize his relations now or in the future with the

1!

players

All four black players on Cornell's freshman team,

however. showed

up for their game with the Syracuse fresh and all played.

On the Iomell campus in Ithaca, Sparks declined comment on what
the grievances were. He said only, “We’ll try to resolve on what. the
grievances were. He said only, “We’ll try to resolve this ilnd have a

statement tomorrow. ”

Campus sources said, however, that the protest. was believed to
stem from the blacks’ contention that Cornell has an unofficial policy
of playing no more than three blacks at one time. Reportedly, tehy
also were protesting that Story deserves to be in the starting line-up

but is not.

Delegate Drive By

300 of the party's 3000 conven-

“The question is whether they
will be indepcncent young people

(it'd, referring to Chicago Mayor

college students has committed
itself to working for the election

Democrats think there’s anauto-

means."

The conference action approved
the formation of a National
Youth Caucus, which is intended to
help students in college commu-
nit'.s pack precinct, county and
district political caucuses with
young persons. If enough are
placed on these caucuses, the
youthful strategists reason, it will
be possible to convince major
party leaders they deserve repre-
sentation in the slate delegations.

The Youth Caucus will be most
concerned with non-primary
stall-s, where concentration of col-
lege students can be more effec-
tive.

When asked about the council's

said that without. it, it would be
