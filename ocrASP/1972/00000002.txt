Banker and Lawyer
Will Serve on Council

by Glenn von Nostitz

C. Theodore Carlson, an Albany
attorney, and Wayne E. Wagner, :1
Schenectady banker, have been
appointed to the SUNYA
University Council by Governor
Rockefeller.

Carlson, a partner in the
prestigious ‘AIbany law firm of
Tabner & Carlson, is a general
practice attorney who has becolne
involved in education law.
Appointed legal counsel of the
South Colonie Schools in 1964,
Carlson has since devoted most
of his practice to education law,
serving most recently with the
Bethlehem Central School
District, an Albany suburb where
he resides.

Carlson claims that he doesn’t

have “the faintest idea” why
Rockefeller appointed him to
serve on the Council. He
mentions, however, that his

father-in-lw is a former Associate
Commissioner of Education, and
that he has known his Council
predecessor since 1953, a man
“whose daughter I used to date."
Geographical considerations may
also have led to his appointment,
as both he and his predecessor
reside in Bethlehem, a town where

Carlson has become closely
involved in Republican party
politics.

While he is as yet unsure of what
he plans to do on the Council,
Carlson does have some definite
views on various issues facing the
University. Commenting on
present and proposed cutbacks in
state aid to education, he says, “i
feel that education has one of the
largest parts of the budget, and
that it will have to share cuts with
other sectors.” He refuses to
condemn the state cuts, saying
that they will merely “result in
some belt-tightening."

Carlson feels that “students
should be able to do anything
they want," but qualifies this by
adding "as long as they don‘t do
physical damage." He gives the
common view that “students
should be encouraged to improve
society in a positive fashion rather
than to destroy without replacing
what was there with something of
greater value."

Along this vein, he offers the
View that students should not
control the operation of the
University, and that “no one

group should control it... Some
areas are better controlled by one
group, another area by another
group." He says that students
should be able to control things
“that are of direct interest to
them" and he mentions, as
examples, dorm regulations and
courses to be offered, “but not
course content. "

When asked what sort of
influence he expects to have on
the Council, Carlson responded
that, “I would expect I would
have a liberalizing influence. I
would tend to be a liberal on the
Council as it is now composed."
He says that one question he may
bring up at Council meetings deals
with the council's policy of
meeting behind closed doors.
Carlson “doesn't see" why
closed-door meetings are always
necessary.

FRIDAY, JANUARY 21, 1972

Governor Rockefeller has appointed (l.r.) Albany attorney C. Theodore Carlson, Albany Law School
Student and SUNYA Alumnus Victor Looper, and Schenectady banker Wayne Wagner to the University
Council. The Appointments should ensure continuance of the council‘s stronger role in University affairs.

result. Generally, reasonable
people can agree. "

Like Carlson, Wayne Wagner, u
vice-president of the Schenectady
Trust Co. has “no idea" why
Rockefeller chose him to serve on
the Council. He claims that he has
no special abilities or experience
in the field of education, and that
he is only vaguely familiar with
Albany State. To better wquaint
himself with SUNYA, he says that
“l'd like to spend an afternoon
over there." While both Wagner
and Carlson profess to be
unfamiliar with SUNYA, this
situation should be remedied soon
when they begin receiving stacks
of material and publications
about the university.

Unlike Carlson, Wagner has few
comments to make on any of the
issues confronting the University,
and he refuses to commit himself
to any conclusions. Wagner says
that he will have to serve on the
Council "for ll long time" before
he can begin lnuking "definite

conclusions. “My position," he
cautions “is not like the politician
who, before he is elected, says,
Il‘m going to do this, and this, and
this,‘ I have to wait until I'm on
the job."

Fiscal Crisis Means:

The State University of, New

The Governor has told the mas-

fewer supplies, and a less costly
summer program are also among
the imposed money saving plans
for Albany. 'l‘he faculty—student ratio 1
