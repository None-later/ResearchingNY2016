editorial

As were many other members of the
university community, we were somewhat
pleased at Governor Rockefeller's appoint-
ment of Victor Looper to the University
Council. But we temper that pleasure with
the hope that the action signifies only the
first step in an attempt to bring that body
of local trustees closer to the students who
are affected by their actions and closer to
the outside community who they ostensi-
bly represent.

To be Sure, Looper's past involvement
with a variety of campus committem. or-
organizations, and governmental councils
will provide him with much invaluable
understanding of campus matters. As he
sits at the inontlily meetings of the local
trustees, they will provide a needed bal-
ance to the iiioiiied men. and women that
dominate the Council at present.

But it would be disastrous if that body.
inadvertantly or otherwise. relies on him
for “the student view" or "the black
perspective." Looper. by lias own ad
mission. is ncapable of offering such
radical student or black input. The (Iounr
cil will only be deludiiig itself if it does
not recognize this fact and move to
correct it.

We have tremendous respect for Looper
as a person sincerely interested in the
welfare of this university. Blll tpiitc lillllllr
ly. most students on this campus are
politically to the left of Victor Looper.
and he is therefore not representative of

the average student view.

It is even more apparent that he does not
offer any kind of meaningful black per-
spective. Blacks on this campus may be
divided into political moderates, radicals,
or cultural nationalists, but they are uni-
ted in being considerably to the left of Vic
Looper.

What the Looper appointment leaves us
with then, is a group of local trustees that
influence a number of campus policies,
but is totally divorced frotn the main-
stream ofcurrcnt student thought.

Nor does the Council truly represent
the Albany community. Where are the
poor people? The store owners? The
blacks? The blue collar workers? Or does
the Governor forget that society is not
composed solely of bankers, lawyers, and
rich. upper-class women and men like
himself?

It is clear that the time has come for a
cliaiige..

The Council should end its policy of
secrecy and open its meetings not only to
interested students on this campus. but to
residents of the Albany community as
well. It is unfortunate that this body of
individuals. hand-picked by the Governor.
must hide its discussions and decisions in a
shroud of secrecy.

(lovernor Rockefeller should begin ap~
pointing people to the University Council
that are not personal political cronies. but
rather. representative (iftllt' community at
large. And since the university and Albany
communities are not separate entities.

Prof. B.K. Johnpoff:

when will students be appointed to sit on
that board?

The University Council should take off
its self-imposed muzzle and begin taking
political stands on local, state, and nation-
al issues that affect this university. Spam.
cally, we refer to Governor Nelson Rock-
efeller’s mangled fiscal program atid the
United States government’s role in South
east Asia, both of which divert needed
educational funds to futile, wasteful goals.
The current belief that the University is
divorced from these societal problems is.
at best, a comical exercise in futility. At
worst, it is a morally reprehensible but
politically expedient course.

These changes would. no doubt. create
some rather embru‘rassing situations. Since
the trustees are appointed by the gover
nor, any criticism aimed in his direction
might provoke some hostile reaction from
a man so concerned with his public image:
an image already tarnished by the bloody
events at Attica and a statewide fiscal
problem ofcrises proportions.

But ultimately. .lic underlying tltiestion
is an important one for all of us here at
Albany State University. Are we truly a
viable community of students. faculty.
administrators. civil servants. etc. as ad
iiiiiiistrative rhetoric would like tis to
believe? ()r are we, instead. a community
of the powerless controlled by the gover
nor and the upper class political appoiii
tees who serve at his pleasure?

editorial

The Governance Commission. appointed
in the fall of 1969 with the task of revising
the university’s gOVCrnmental structures,
has issued its report to the University
Senate. Now that body must examine the
revisions and decide if they merit univer-
sity--wide attention and eventual adop-
tion.

The most significant change recom
mended by the commission is a broaden-
ing of representation in the Senate. Pro»
fessional and service staff will also be
included; the proposed new breakdown is:
Faculty 40%. Student 30%, Professional
staff 5%. Service staff 5%. and “ex offi-
Cio" members 20%.

We applaud this move: there is whole-
hearted agreement with the (Ioininission's
belief that: “It was personal injustice to
withhold from any member of the iiiiiver
sity community the human. decent. .nid
democratic privilege ol having his voice
reckoned in the disposition of matters in
which he has a considerable interest."

What is distressing is the fact that the
Governance Commission has opted to car

ry its concerns with democracy only to a

certain point. Further on in its report. it is
stated: “To have no voice in decisions
affecting your life is something to which
no one should be asked to submit...liut
every sensible person acknowledges that in
some circumstances others liaVe a greater

stake and/or competance which entitles
them to greater consideration."

Or, to put it more succinctly: Every-
body's equal-but some are more equal
than others.

And. of course, it is the 14,000 students

at this institution who are the least equal
ofall. Though forming a percentage major-
ity, the “commumity” gives them minor
voting power because. in the Commission‘s
words: “The student‘s affiliation is as brief
as it is crucial and that works against their
developing the same expertise as the facul-
t 
Oh. really?
The problem with this unacceptable ar-
rangement and faulty logic is most notice-
able oii the commission and council level
of the Seante--wlicre most of the work is
done. Under the new proposal:

l. The EXL‘L‘UthL‘ Committee. which has
power to act unilaterally on “urgent (Sen-
ate) matters". has three undergraduate out
of IS members.

2. The (Iouncil on Educational Policy.
charged with setting campus academic
priorities. has eight students (graduates
and undergraduates) out of 33 members.

.3. The seventeen member Undergraduate
Academic (Iouncil. which establishes adr
missions policies and reviews and recoiir
incnds undergrad programs. has live under

graduates.

4. Undergraduates comprise only one

third of the Student Affairs (Iouncil.

will merely reinforce my view (a

   

5. The Council on Research, which
review and allots all University research
funds, has ten members---and only one
undergraduate. '

6. And the Faculty Grievance Commis-
sion has no students at all offering their
views. .

On most of the other councils and
commissions, the ratios are about the
same.

If these facts disturb you — and they
should- you might also be interested to
know that the president of your student
government is a member of the Govern-
ance Commission, helped draft the pro-
posals, and label them “progressive”
Your vice-president never bothered to read
the report. And the vice<chairman of your
Central Council never saw the plan be—
cause he is not in the Senate. He doesn't
know what the Governance Commission
is!

Needless to say. we hope quite a few
students go to Monday‘s Senate meeting
and inquire further about its “pro-
gressive,” “democratic” and “community
nature. And we hope the student members
of the Senate will question this token
allotment of voting power.

As one student senator observed earlier
this week: “Students wouldn‘t be so apa-
thetic if they knew how much power was

up for grabs."

 

I should like to add my veiee to
those already raised in favor of
the promotion of Dr. David
Goodman to the rank of
asassociate professor, and also in
favor of his being granted
continuing appointment by the
university.

The objections to Dr.
Goodman's promotion are bale
on three items: (1) his scholarship
is faulty; (2) his teaching is little
more than competent at the
undergraduate level, and (3) his
graduate teaching is weak. All
three of these arguments, I
suggest, are rationalizations, for
all three are not substantiated by
fact.

The arguments against Dr.
Goodman's scholarship make two
basic arguments: if) his work is
narrative; (2) the critical reVIews
have been divided. lri reverse
order, let me make short slirift of
the second argument. Only a
single adverse revrew can be found

of either Dr. Goodman's works,
and this rewew (by Bingham in
the .lom'm/l o/ Ion-mini l/ii/ori'
,,l is the work of a minor figure
known for his inability to review a
book adequately or favorably l l
have suffered through fotir of his
reviews in preparing this letter and
am amazed that any revrewer
could vent so much spleen). The
other reVIews, all in respectable
journals and all by respectable
scholars-some of whom are highly
reputable ~urii posuive.

It is unfortunate that Dr.
Goodman's work is so lightly
treated. His scholarship is of
suffimeni quality to demand
serious eonsuleration. The
off-hand attacks upon his work
raises serious question regarding
their true basis and/or purpose.
He is assailed as a narrative
lilStOtltIn--l, on the contrary, have
been assailed as a polumlCISi. It is
interesting that one of the

department-Arthur Ekirch»has
written a strong dissent from his
department's majority finding. It
is, likeWIse, strange that tenure
and promotion have regularly
been granted at this school to
members of the faculty whose
scholarly production is zero. I
could cite a case last year where
promotion was voted fora history
faculty member who has
produced half of one article in his
nine years on our faculty, and I
could CllL‘ a case when: tenure was
voted for a faculty member whose
editing work on a book of essays
was called "pm honor" and
"inconsequential" in the only
review of that work.

I must ask whether we really
want scholarship, or whether we
want to keep the faculty a club in
which we protect our friends and
punish those whose styles we do

problems in which the university
now finds itself. The criterion of
scholarship ought to be limited to
scholarship. It is tragic that it is
used as a cover for favoritism, the
hallmark of this university.

As for Dr. Goodman's teaching,
it is probably the most effective in
the department~possibly in the
school. The fact is that more than
300 students are willing to sit
through his history class antl that
they consider it a valuable
learning experience. The claim
that he was in error on some
historical minuteae at an MA.
comprehensive examination does
not appear to be accurate. It
appears that there was a
difference of opinion involved .
The key criterion for effective
teaching is how it affects students;
certainly on this ba5is Dr.
Goodman has been a successful
teacher-probably the best in the
school.

There is a dangerous inference
in the dean's statement which I
suggest augurs ill for this school.
It is suggested that the Western
History field be completely
eliminated. At a time when we
speak in terms of FTE., and when
the field of Western History has
such great interest, it would he
suicidal to do away With that
field. If, as it appears to me, this
act is aimed primarily at makinn
Dr. Goodman's posttion heri-
untenable, it is an outragious cau-
of cutting off one's nose to spin-
his face. How can we explain
some of the largely unattended
courses In European History
which floods our books? Are iin
not really far less relevant to our
students than Western History?
And these are taught by highly
paid faculty,
Goodman is among the least

whereas Di

costly.

This apparent effort to foicn
Dr. Goodman from our nntlst is
