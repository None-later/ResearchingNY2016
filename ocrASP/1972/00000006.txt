4i THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, 1] vrvrd portrait of life in {I smarli
Texas town in the I‘ISO's. with several cxccllcrit performances tlIld II
smashing directorial effort by Pcter lirrgdziriovich. Hollywood‘s ncw
Golden Boy.

5) THE (JO-BETWEEN, Illt most successful work to dzitc by the
team of Joseph LUSCy and Harold Pinter. Utilizing 2] minimum of
dialogue and a maximum of artistic flair. it describes in minutes!
detail the “growing pains” of (1 young boy in the summer of WOO. A
touching rind sensitive film.

6) THE FRENCH CONNECTION: I‘ve yet to hear of anyone who
didn't like tlirs fast-paced and hugely entertaining thriller about two
stipcrcops tracking down it shipment of heroin. A grciit performance
by (lcnc Hackinrin is it kcy highlight.

7i TAKING OFF, one of the most “forgotten films" of 107]. The
first film in English by Milos Formun (Lover Ufa Biollde, The
I‘l'remcri'r Hall) is totally delightful, alternating between perceptive,
hilarious satire and honest pathos In its almost cincnia-vcritc
examination of the runaway-child syndrome. A great cost, with Lynn
Carlin (Faces) and Buck Hcrrry especially effective,

8) DEATH IN VENICE. Thomas Mann's iichIla of one man's quest
for perfection filmed with beauty and strength by Luchirio Visconti.
Its great length irrid lcisurcly pricmg make it designed for a specific.
very sclch audience, as is.

0] I'IIE DEVILS, Ken Russell‘s orgy of brutality and ltrsl in 17th
(‘cntiiry I‘TtIIICC, culminating in a strongly stated plea for human
llilL‘ftlllL‘L‘. A most misunderstood film, by critics and public tliikc.

Iii) TIIE ('LOWNS. Federico Fellini's delightful and colorful
documentary on the lost art of the clown.

/\ number of other quality rclczrscs in ‘7] should certainly be
rccoinmcirdcd, including: KLUTIZ. and enjoyable tlirillcr with it
sciisutrnnril performance by Jane Fonda, SHAFT, u witty and exciting
copsundrohlicrs adventure featuring Isaiic Haycs' brilliant, electric
scorc. SKIN GAME, which offers the delightful Lou Gossett in a
script that is very clever and witty (at least for the first half),
SUMMER OF ‘42, it terrible script redeemed by a vivid recreation of
the wartime atmosphere and the lovely Jennifer O’Neill, THE
ANDROMEDA STRAIN, kind of a dopey picture but nonetheless
enjoyable; BANANAS, with enough good gags to almost make you
forget the many that misﬁre; and, for totally brainless entertainments,
ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES and THE ANDERSON
TAPES.

On the other side of the coin. l97l didn‘t have as many patently
rotten films as the year before it (remember 1970? Love Story?
Airport?) . but we were offered: CLAIRE‘S KNEE, an astonishingly
overrated, incomparable bore; DOC and ZACHARIAH, two Vile,
witlcss, and infantile ‘updatings' of the Great Western Myth, JOHNNY
GOT HIS GUN,tI well-meaning but hopelessly incompetent adaptation
of a line novel; WILLARD, the Suckers‘ Movie of the Year, a
ridiculous “thriller” which attracted millions of patrons through a
terriﬁc ad campaign; WHO IS HARRY KELLERMAN? and
DESPERATE CHARACTERS, two supposedly profound, but
uncommonly dull, studies of people awash in their ownjuices, and
FORTUNE AND MEN'S EYES, touted as a topical expose of prison
life but with all the relevance to today as the Pcloponnesion War, And
not half iis exciting.

A special mention should go to DOCTORS‘ WIVES. certainly the
funniest ubortion of the year and an answer to those who thought
than no film could be worse than MADAME X...
