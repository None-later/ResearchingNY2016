ALBANY, NY. (AH— After they all move into
the South Mall Legislative building, New York
Assemblymen and 57 State Senators will be using
offices outfitted with about $1 million worth of
furniture.

a " irzﬁmwwagwhu .

And that's at bargain prices, according to the
state. Without a 45 to 50 per cent discount included
on state contracts purchasing the furniture, the cost
would have come in at about $2 million for a suite
of two offices—one for the legislator and one for his
staff.

at:

Legislative leadership and committee chairman
have larger suites to accommodate larger staffs.

The cost figures on the furnishings are based on
standard state contracts arrived at after competitive
bidding, won by two New York State companies.

"The architect wanted imported things to go with
the decor and we said no. We put two stipulations in
and we prevailed - that it all be done on state
contract and all be New York State made," said
Assemblyman James L. Emery, R-Geneseo, a mem—
ber of a joint legislative committee that had the
final word on what furniture would go into the
offices.

The Legislative Building at the Mall is only
partially completed, but legislators already occupy
the 4th, 5th and 6th floors. The 7th floor is
expected to be ready for occupancy by the end of
the month.

,_ in all, 80 Assemblymen and 31 State Senators
have offices in the new building, and 28 other
Assemblymen—for a total of 54 Democrats and 54
Republicans—and several other States Senators are
scheduled to move onto the 7th floor when it is
furnished.

The average cost for the staff
office furnishings is based on
desks and chairs for a receptionist
and secretary, sofa, two club
chairs and two end tables.

"But there are some changes in
this," according to E. Davis Gail-
Iard, assistant director of South
Mall construction.

“If a legislator had only one
secretary we gave the extra desk
to someone else who might need
it."

The quality of the furniture has
been described as “an oldsmobile,

\,

rather than a Cadillac or Ply-
mouth," by Paul Young, who was
in charge of the competitive bid-
ding for 068.

"In each instance," Young said,
“The level of quality is second to
none, the prices equal to what
anyone can buy and better than
most."

"This furniture is built to last,"
Emergy said. "in the long run it's
more economical...dollar for dol-
lar it should be more advan-
tageous to us over the long haul."

“ The cost for each two-room
averages $2,490, after the discount. The average
cost for the adjoining staff office is $2,100: after
