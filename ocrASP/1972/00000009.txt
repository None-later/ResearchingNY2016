[WHOM

ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP)— Istanbul became a ghost
town Sunday as the city’s three million inhabitants
were immobilized by an all-day curfew. Squads of
soldiers in camouﬂage dress with guns at the ready,
carried out a house-to-house search for urban
guerrillas.

More than 80,000 troops and police took part in
the massive operation, code named “Tornado One”
by Istanbul’s martial law command.

The command announced some arrests had been
made and some weapons seized, but gave no details.

SALISBURY, Rhodesia (AP)— A spokesman for the
British commission testing Rhodesian opinion on
the proposed settlement between Britain and the
breakaway colony said Sunday the group will
continue its mission despite black rioting that has
resulted in 15 deaths.

The violence in several Rhodesian cities and the
almost unanimous opposition from blacks has
prompted talks of failure. Some have speculated
that London may recall the commission. The
official death toll remained at 15 shot by police and
49 suffering gunshot wounds. The government
refused comment on allegations that seven of the
dead were bayonetted in the Umtali riots Thursday.

CAIRO (AP)-- New austerity measures to put the
Egyptian economy on a war footing went into
effect todayJincy include a ban on imported
luxury items, higher taxes, and a promise to crack
down on the thriving black market,

San Francisco, Calif. (CPS) Dis-
ney Productions has filed suit in
federal court here against Air Pir-
ates Funniea for allegedlytrying
to destroy their business. The
complaint asks $540,000 in dams
ages.

In a comic book called Air
Pirate Funnies, claims Disney Pro-
ductions, such familiar old chums
as Mickey Mouse and Minnie
Mouse are turned into sex exhibi-
tionists and Donald Duck into a
Peeping Tom.

This assault, says the suit, is
designed to “interfere with and, if
possible, to destroy the business
of the plaintiff and the assets of
said business.”

The suit asks $140,000 in darn:
ages for copyright infringement
and $100,000 in punitive damages

 

 

from each of four artists named.
The complaint also lists 50 John
Does as defiling Disney characters.

Disney attorney John Hagler
said the defendents have agreed
not to publish further issues of
the publication and not to sell any
of the remaining issues in stock
pending Disney‘s hearing on a
permanent injunction.

Joseph Rhine, counsel for Hell
Comics, publisher of Air Pirates
Funnies, claims “our people had a
right to use the characters for
parody purposes." He feels that
“Mickey Mouse bclongs to cvury—
oiic,..and certainly Wc arc not
going to destroy Disncy I’roduc—
lions."

“NIXON
DOC

by Fred Branfinaii
and Steve Colin

There has been sonic (piuslion a.
to just what the Nixon Docirinc
means in priiclicc Its ildVUL‘illi'x‘
claim that, it is designed to lessen
Amci'iciin involvement abroad,
with tlic US. providing only
matcrial support for friendly third
world countries fighting coni-
munism.

Critics cliargc that it is a ration
ale for gri-atcr U.S. iiivolw-mcnt,
allowing American leaders grcalcr
freedom to intervene in the third
world by massch use of air powcr
instead of domestically unpopular
U.S. foot soldiers.

No less an authority than
Itichard Nixon himself has re-
ccntly provided a perfect examplc
to cnd thc controversy.

On Nov. ill, l07l , he stated in a
press cont'crcncc that "Cambodia
is the Nixon doctrine in its purest
form."

It is indccd. (‘amhodia was at
pcacc wlicn Richard Nixon took
office, Today it knoWs full-scale
war Unlike Vietnam, unlike Laos,
American involvcment in (Jam
bodia cannot be laid to Johnson,
Kennedy. Eisenhower, or Truman,
It is truly Mr. Nixon's affair, and
he is to be congratulated for
taking full responsibility for it.

ports havc lengthened the list:
'i‘aing Kiiiik. Biiray, Kamphong
'l'hmar, chah Sanday, ’i‘uoi Lcap.

But such incidents mark the
relativciy fcw liincs tlial US. rc-
porlers have happened to observe
first-hand bombed-out towns or
villages. Vast areas of northeastern
and northern Cambodia have been
inaccessible to the western press.
and the actual number of towns
and villages leveled can only be
guessed at,

THE BOMBS FALL

Most observcrs have echoed such
rcports as a New York 'I‘imcs
dispatch dated Dcc,2, l97l:

“'l'hcrc is growing evidence that
the peasants fleeing the country-
srdi- not far from licrc do so
because of allied bombing and
artillery firth-most of it, American
and South Vietnamese-mud not
because communist troops are
present or because pitched battles
are being fought by the Cam-
bodians and North Vietnamese
invaders."

“‘thn the communists came all
the houses were standing,’ said
Meas Yat, a farmer who fled the
village of Tout Leap about 12
miles west of Phnom Penh's cen-
ter two weeks ago

“‘But after they spent the night
inside the village, the airplanes
came and started bombing, so we
all left.‘

This Army is raised, trained, and

What is called “economic” aid is
entirely such war-related acts as

Army.
