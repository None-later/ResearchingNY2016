think he can win an election with a black running

dilTl'I‘t‘ltl type of politics.

There are the countless other victims oI' our death
culture ()Id people who must survive on their
meager social security checks that can't even
provide them Willi the necessities of daily living.
They were good enough to send sons oil to wars
and good enough to build the nation with their
blood, sWI-al and tears, They belieVed in the
American Dream Machine, yet now they were old
and they discowred that the machine didn’t care
about them anymore and all they could look
forward to was death, For these Americana,
campaign speeches are empty and void of any rel
significance. For many young people who once
believed that their enthusiasm and idealism could
change things, the 1972 elections will only further
their disillusionment. Many scorn the so-called
democratic process and see it as little more than a
hoax. Many feel that men can't change things, and
that the single most oppressive obstacle to change iii
a system that not only allows, but aides in the
destruction of human III'e Iiiid human values,

So King Ilichard will continue to lie to the
Ameri an people. He Is a master at the art. a true
political being, and it enough people can deceive
tliemseIVI-s, I\'iiig Richard will continue to reign;
And We can once again expect llIibert Humphrey to
fill the television set with his jolly smile. He will try
to shed the skin oI' his oIil boss, aiitl claim that he
did voice disapproval when Johnson initiated hII
genocidal policies lliihert \vIlI come ol'l' as the
Irlt‘lttl of all Americans and hide the former
Humphrey whose hands suggest that they are
soaked In the blood of :ltt,tttttl American boys and
countless- other vicIims' ot' iliiit satanic war.

And John Lindsay will talk about the problems of
the American city as It. Iliere really was a cure. He
will claim that as President he could save all the
cities and that the only reason he could tiol save
New York was because of \l’asbington's hostility,
Nothing is going to save the New Yorks and L.A.’s
from the heroin, crime, slums, Iiiid destruction that.
is their destiny.

And we could go on from candidate to candidate
anti try to discover some aiisWer, someone who can
get, us out ot‘ this nightmarish web in whiCh our
country has entrapped herself. In 1968 the answer
may hIIVe been available, but he Is dead now,
Perhaps we would he a little wiser if we realized that
one man may not solve our problems. General
- u E d T d 4.00 Motors and (‘hase Maiihaltan have destroyed mo
  n S 0  y I much to answer to one man. The generals and their
cohorts hIIVe caused too much death and suffering
to millions, and thev can not answer to one man,

He said that "strong military defenses are not the
enemy ol' peace, they are the guardians ot peace,"
The l’resident ironically believes that the United
States, a country so weakened by Internal st s is
strong enough to he an international guardian of

 

peace.

In Southeast Asia, the war goes on :\t the ('apilol,
the President avoided any significant mention ol' the

One does not have to be a Congressman to realize
that the President has mice again .tried to pull shades

Turning to issues at home, again the President's
remarks Iire hollow This leader tells his nation that
“we are making Ii new prosperity without war,"
How can Mr Nixon expect American citizens,
young and old, to support and believe in his
proposals while they stand in l’ront ot~ welfare and
unemployment offices with empty promises in
hand

The Ii per cant unemployed do not t'eel prosper-
ous; instead they wonder what happened to the

President's promise Inade in 1068 that there will be
a major decline in unemployment.

In IEltiI‘i, Nixon called for an increase in law and
