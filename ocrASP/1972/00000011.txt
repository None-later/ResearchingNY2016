'm Milne is Needed!

Dear Sirs:

ln spite of the negative com-

ments we hear concerning the
Milne School, we would like to
express our appraisal of that
school system.

As Business Education majors.
we found Milne to be an asset in
our preparation in the teacher
education program, From our
own personal experiences and
from speaking with students who
hold similar views. Milne offers iin
ideal environment for acquiring
the teacher “know‘how”.

The people who come in con-
tact with Milne students are ex-
posed to and become acquainted
with high. medium and low
achievers. Although they are of ii

\ select group. chosen to be a part

1’ of the Cam pus school. they are
still students who encounter so~
cial. family and personal problems
of various dimensions. Issues on
drugs. abortion. home life atmos-
phere and the war continue to
play a not-su-happy role here in
the life of these kids as they do
everywhere else. There iilso are
those that are quite conte- t.

What makes Mil re and these

students so special? Where else do

' school systems offer workshops

observations" What other means

TUESDAY, JANUARY 25. 1972

In May of 1971, Vice-President for Academic
Affairs Phillip Sirotkin announced the formation
of an Environmental Studies Steering Committee
with the responsibility to “devalop policies and
content for the Environmental Studies Pro-
gram." Since that time the Steering Committee
has made little policy and has yet to develop any
content for courses in Environmental Studies.
Last Spring the Committee announced that new
environment courses would be offered in Fall.
1971. but these never came into existence. Then.
in the Committee’s first progress report to
President Benczct it was said that. "This Spring
(1972) we can expect to see the introduction of
courses which deal directly with the environ-
ment.” and it was announced that two new
courses Would be offered. “Social. Political. and
Human Aspects of Enviornmcntal Problems."
and “Scientific Aspects of Environmental Pro-
hlcms." ’I'hc new scnicstcr has arrivcd. and tlicsc

piition. We are made aware of
what to expect when we have our
own class . , We become confident
in lesson planning. being at ease
before students and are alert to
the problems existing with stu-
deiits today.

 

Milne offers us an opportunity
to do all this and more before our
actual teaching positions. We
make our mistakes here and then
go forward with all our learnings
and apply them where it really
counts. The students at Milne
benefit from securing ideas from
seVeral teachers iind supervisors.
The teachers acquire an iidvair

as ii practical experience and a
very valuable asset.

Isn't this ii good part of what
education is'.’ Learning and being

our best presentation of course
work. Students are stimulated and
from this. knowledge and educa-
tion continues to grow.

Milne. We love you - thanks for
making us better future teachers,

and President Bcnczct. as they seemed totally
unaware of each other’s activities in the environ-
mental studies field. Instead of making the
progress of the committee clearer to the univer-
sity. the forum merely succeeded in confusing
those present.

Another factor contributing to the Commit-
tcc's lack of progress sectns to be a feeble and
half-hearted coininittmcnt on the part of the
administration and the committee. They tell us
that they are “firmly behint" environmental
studies. but their support cnds licre—-it consists
of little more than words. If the Administration
and the Steering (Ionimittcc were truly behind

however, is highly doubtful, and if it is the case,

the administration has made

no effort to inform

the university about these accomplishments. We
only ask that if the administration has given up
its effort. they tell us so. They are deluding us by
saying that courses will be offered “in the Fall of

time to stop pretending.

But that is a bit too hasty and
presumptious.

On the other hand. I would
rather be optimistic (not demand-
ing. just optimistic) on things like
the University Council. So. I sug‘
gest that we begin considering the
appointment of a few students to
the Council. especially in light of
the report that this body will be
making regulations "governing the
conduct of students." etcetern. in
the article entitled. "Univ. Coun-
cil Will Have Strong Voice.“ Fine
The more people the "power" in
this university is distributed a-
mongst. the better. But rememr
her. the school. and all of educa-
tion exists primarily for the good
of the students. If a voice is going
to be given to a group comprised
of businessmen who are not di-
rectly connected with SUNYA.
but make major decisions binding
its occupants. then it seems advis-
able to allow the students to at
least look over their shoulders
while they're making these (lecis
ions.

too doriuindmg a proposal, Thai is
exactly what I don't. want to he so

There were several objections
during the last Central Council
meeting to the Student
Association's funding of
Sweet Fire. Now although most of
these objections concerned al-
legedly technical questions. such
as “Should Student Tax support
the Sweet Fires delivered off-
campus." iind “Is it necessary for
Sweet Fire to use tape recorders."
I could not help feeling that an-
derlying the debate was a Very
basic philosophical issue which
only once in a while rose to the
surface of discussion. That the
debate lasted almost two hours
confirmed my feelings. as did a
few heated outbursts during that
time. “If it Were up to me. Sweet
fire wouldn‘t be supported at all ~

it's iin outright revolutionary.
commie paper." being the most
memorable.

“lllatantly Political"

Despite the preoccupaiice With
tape recorders. l think the real
question in debate was first of all
“Should the Student Association
support a student newspaper
which has a political bias"" This
question was ilt‘ltltllly slated by
one Council member. who con

damned support of Sweetfire oti
the grounds that the latter was
“blatantly political.”

Howevar. I think it fiiirly ob-
vious that the nonpolitical news-
paper is a nonexistent creature.
Every paper has political stance,
however subtle. which is deter-
mined if not be a declared poli-
tical position then by the kind of
news the paper chooses to print.
the kind of news it chooses to
ignore. and the orientation of the
newswriters and hence of the edi-
torials and news stories. This
means that even ASP is ii political
paper. The fact that ASP chooses
not to discuss matters supposedly
unrelated to the university. or
more to the point. the fact that it
chooses not to discuss issues in
side the university from ii left-
wmg point of view. does not mean
that ASP is not political-it only
means it is not left-wing. If ii
paper is not critical of the stiitiis
qiio. then it is favorable toward
the status (pm. If. on the other
hand. the paper is (‘rltlt'ill ol' l.ll('

Support Extreme Left?

Thus the real question under-
lying the Council debate was not
“Should the Student Association
support political newspapers." but
instead. “Should the Student
Association support certain kinds
of political newspapers. that is.
papers of extreme left (or right)
wing persuasion?"

Now the response to this ques-
tion by the liberal must on prin-
ciple. be "yes." Freedom of
thought. opinion. speech. the
press - these negative freedoms (
i.e .. freedoms from the restraints
of others) are the crux of liberal-
ism. The liberal who says "Freer
dom for all opinions which are
not threatening to my own." is
not ii liberal iii the philosophical
sense of the word.

negative freedoms. Indeed. histo-
rically only a portion of liberal
society has enjoyed these free-
doms. and this portion has always
had a specific economic/cultural
chiiracter. It has been middle and
upper‘middle class. white. and
male and heterosexual to boot.
Thus. to take and example. the
liberal principle of freedom of the
press for a long time contained a
built-in limitation: only the
wealthy could afford to run news-
papers. Today as it becomes ﬁnan-
cially possible for small papers to
be printed fairly cheaply. liberals
engage in activities of either dis-
couragement or repression of the
underground. left-wing. and cultu-
rally subversive press.

Individual Freedom First

lndividual freedom is the first
principle of liberalism; equality is
not, And out of this disparity
between freedom and equality in
liberalism comes one of the pri»
mary philosophical differences be-

at Sweet Fire

tween the liberal and the radical.
The liberal considers individual
freedom to be freedom regardless
of how many people actually pos-
sess it, To the radical, individaul
liberties are liberties only if they
exist equally for all members of
society. not merely in theory but
in fact. It is indeed not liberal
freedoms. but their unequal distri-
bution in society. against which
radicals revolt.
