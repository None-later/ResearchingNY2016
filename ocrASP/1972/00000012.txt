learn that Catholics in Northern
Ireland are “riotors” and “mobs”
(United Pre International).
“crowds of roclcthrowing Callio-

and "gunmen" and “lerroris

As for the little independent
coverage by American television
that does take place, it struck me
as revealing that all the television
cameramen I saw over a two
month period in Northern Ireland
last summer were on the opposite
side from me. lurking side by side
with government intelligence pho-
tographers quite literally behind
the shields and under the protec»
tioii ol' the British Army. (Inci-
dentally. the photographs accoin
