' Emerson, Lake,

 

by Steve Aminol

So now that we're all agreed that rock has changed
very little with tltese rapidly moving times of ours.
now that we are aware that what was once a strong.
proud rock bastion is now fortified by only a
handful of our most relentless superstars. now that
we realize that there are riiaiiy intrinsic Values to
rock music the best of which we do not wish to see
drowned timid a sea of stiltpCd‘ltp reverberation and
chordal as well as tonal stagnation, where do we go
from here‘.’

Keith liniersori in coiiiiirictiori with his very able
associates Greg Lake and Carl ’almei have given its
good reasoti to be hopeful. Refugees from The Nice.
King Crimson aritl Atomic Rooster respectively.
these musicians bring llicii separate yet interwoven
ideas into :igragatio'r now called I'IllClstill. lake and

probably the riiost promising stuff we‘ve had from
them to date.

All respect is dire to Lake's written. vocal and bass
work and Palmer‘s pervtisiVe poundings. However.
this rendition of “Pictures at an Exhibition" is
clearly the exhibition of a great organ player at his
best. This album ltas its most sensational and also its
most sensitive moments when Keith Emerson let
loose to work those marvelous keyboards of his.

well as beginning both for the constiming public arid
Emerson.

Now the team of Emerson. Lake Palmer and
Mussorgsky have collaborated on a piece that
demands our fullest attention. I'm not sure about
what my classically-riiinded frietids Will have to say
about this albtiiti. but l consider it a tremendous
salute to a composer when successful super-rockers
such as liLP devote so much energy to one of his

We are very pleased when we see a so-called

search feverishly for a new

direction to take their music at the risk of losing a

bit ol their followrrig. We are even more pleased
when the results tiiiii run to be as fltiid as “Pictures
