Board of Regents
pose Tuition Hike

by Howard Clark
Associated Press Writer

Albany, NY (AH—The State Board of Regents
suggested Wednesday iin increase in State University
tuition but would not. say how much ofan inci'i. se
should be considered,

"That‘s up to the State Universtiy Board of
Trustees.” said Joseph McGovern, chancellor of the
(Regents, governing body of education in the state.

We have adopted a general policy."

The policy was presented as a ' 'itewide finance
plan for higher education—public and private col-
leges. In addition to increased tuition til the State
University. the plan included these elements:

End to Free CUNY

~An end to the free tuition policy at the City
University of New York. Again no tuition figure
was recommended. The Regents would retain the
City University's policy of admitting all high school
graduates who apply.

"I‘wo tuition levels for undergradlnitcs in public
colleges. The tuition for freshmen and sophomores
would be lower than that. for juniors and seniors.
No figures were given.

*A greatly expanded program of scholar incentch
payments on a sliding scale according to llll'
student‘s ability to pav. The state would pay part
or all of the tuition ol a newly student attending a
pliblic college, and up to $l5tltl a ycar fora needy
student to attend a private college

Retention of the (‘in University as a scparatc

claimed that the Governor had
“devised the most diubolic plot

llltfllli" He continued, “They
made us believe viseious lies," in
reference to his charge that the
inmates at Attica did not receive
fair treatment from the state. He
contended that his committee was
led to believe that all the stories
and charges made by prison offi-
cials against inmates had been
substantiated.
