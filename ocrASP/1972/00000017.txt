DACCA AP — Soviet recognition of Bangladesh is
expected to spur other nations to join the lineup.
and officials of the young nation expressed great
pleasure today at Moscow's move.

The Soviet consul-general to Dacca conveyed his
government's decision to Prime Minister Mujibur
Rahman in Tangail, where he was attending a
ceremony. President Nikolai V. Podgorny iind Pre-
mier Alexei N. Kosygin telegraphed Sheik Mujib:
We convey to you and to the people of Bangladesh
friendly wishes of peace, well-being and success in
consolidating the state sovereignty of your country,
in building a peaceful democratic republic."

HONG KONG AP — Radio Hanoi indicated today
that President Nixon ‘s Vietnam peace proposals are
not acceptable because they do not abandon the
Vietnamization program and do not withdraw all
support from President Nguyen Van Thieu,

Although the North Vietnamese radio did not
reject the eight-point plan which Nixon said was
submitted to the Communists in Paris three months
ago, it said they contained “nothing new." Hanoi
called again for the United States to accept the
seven»point Viet Cong plan submitted to the Paris
peace talks last July.

All State University of New
York at Albany freshmen and
sophomores are graded "satisfac-
tory" or "unsatisfactory" ex—
ccpt...

The best, and only, way to
describe this school's grading poli-
cy is to say that it is a mandatory
siitisfactory/unsatisfactory system
with exceptions.

Although this might seem con<
tradictory, as far as university
legislation goes, it is not. In the
fall of 1969, a mandatory S/U
grading system for all freshmen
and sophomores was passed by
the University Senate. This a ‘ade-
mic year the Senate allowed the
Committee on Academic Standing
to givo blanket exemptions to S/U
grading to petitioning students.

Reasons for Exemptions

So what have we got? S/U gra-
ding has been in effect for 2%
years. Although the system is
mandatory, as of last semester
some 800 exemptions have been
granted. This semester, the first in
which all requests were officially
granted, some 1052 petitions have
been received for A-E grading.

llow (lid wc evolve to this posi-
tion‘! [Carly last year a survey was
conducted to determine the effect
of S/U grading on medical and
dental school applicants' chances
of hcing admitted to schools. The
survey revealed that S/U grading
adversely affected their chantrcs ol
acceptance.

atioii 'l'his inevitably increases the

significance of the remaining cre-
dentials. Potentially it would
place far too much weight on
GRE scores. Another department
official stated, “...Gencrally we
will not admit students who have
S/U grades in any courses except
athletics and arts and crafts. Pass/
fail transcripts are essentially
worthless for judgments about
graduate students admissions."
S/U grades were also found to
have a detrimental affect upon
financial awards decisions accord-
ing to the study of SUNYA dc-
partments. The most important
factors in the awards decision

students were: its consequence in
later school life I) graduate
school, 2) professional school, 3)
transfer, the system did not allow
students to know where they
stood in a course, some students
lacked motivation because they
were not rewarded with an "A" or
“B” for working hard and/or
doing well.

Students ideas for modifying the
system included: make S/U grad-
ing an option, have S/U only in
electives, have S/U for the first
year only. One student proposed it
new system that would award a
I‘D" with one credit, it "C" with

to explore academically unfami-
liar areas, and to show more moti-
vation and intellectual curiosity.
Several studies at other schools
have shown that students do ex-
plore more with SIU. One study
showed that one school was losing
students who liked to experiment
and take “cognitive risks" at a
higher ratio than those who were
most comfortable with traditional
systems.

The American Council on Edu-
cation surveyed schools with S/U
systems. At one university it was
found that manv students tried to
aim no higher than a “C” al-
though competition was still pre-

allow S/U courses only outside of
a student's major field of study. A
modified S/U system with high
pass, pass, low pass, and fail or
no-credit is still another possible
option.
Optional S/U

Most recently, the Undergra-
duate Academic Council approved
the concept of an optional four
year S/U system. This could take
seVeral forms. One could be hav-
ing a mixture of S/U and tradi-
tionally graded courses each se-
mester. Another, and the seeming-
ly most popular, alternatiVe is to
allow the student to choose each
semester whether he wants all his
courses graded S/U or A-E. ’I‘wo
proposals advocating this plan
have been drawn up. One of the
two, authored by Richard Collier,
academic advisor, university col-
lege, who was one of the origin-
ators of the 1969 system, calls for

 

were found to be grades in the
student's major followed by let-
ters of recommendation. 54% of
the departments indicated that
even if a student has S/U only for
the first two years it would have a
negative affect on an awards deci-
sion. If a student has more than
25% of his courses graded S/U he
will have trouble obtaining aid.
S/U grades in a student's major
have an even more detrimental
affect.

A large majority of the students
herc have more than list of their

juniors. Some students havv as

two, a “B” with three credits and
an “A” with four credits. Under
the system a student would have
to complete 240 credits. Thus a
student who gets straight "A's"
would need only 60 course credits
to graduate.

Transferring is also made more
difficult by the S/U system. Many
schools indicate that more infor~

Alternatives
In view of all this information,
what is Albany doing? Early advo‘
cates of the S/U system argue that
the spirit and intent of the 1969
Senate resolution are being sub~
Verted by the exemptions granted.
Others are claiming that the ex

gill according to the liltiEl bill.
SomiI argue that the system is

others claim that thc llieorV is
fine, but in practicality the system
is infeasible.

Proposals for alterniitchs to the
system range from returning from
the A-E system to a system which
Would only record the courses
that a student passed. ()nc possi-
ble alternatch to the S/U system
is the establishment of an Office
of Evaluation. Under this proposal
a student would receive his credits
by passing examinations. While
the proposal was passed by the
Undergraduate Academic (‘ouncil
and forwarded to other coininit~
tccs, it appears that this system
has little chance of final approval.
One major obstacle is that the
cost of the plan would be quite
high, iind with the university's
fiscal plight it is doiiblfiil that
anything Willi a “prici- tag" Will
I)t' passed

()tln-r iiltcriiatchs to lhi.l current
system, while not being actively
considered now, include: S/U grii-
ding with faculty recommenda-
tions, it limited S/U plan with the
number of courses graded as such

being restricted by semester. Ano-
ther form of this system is to

the " ' " of the quality

point average and the D,E,U,I,W
and X grades would not carry
credit towards graduation. The
other, by Robert Morris, dean of
undergraduate studies, is essent-
ially the same as Collier‘s The
major point of departure is in the
number of credits required for a
student to remain at the univer-
isty. The Collier proposal requires
Ichr credits for academic reten—
tion than Morris'.
Arguments

Arguments against the various
alternatives are numerous. Faculty
recominenilations, while usually a
favored device for evaluation, are
quite iinpraclical, if not impos»
siblc, at a university of this size. A
mixud S/U and Ali plan by sem-
estcr has been tried at other
schools The results havv not been
good. it has been found that the
students tend to "slack off” in
S’ll graded courses and work har
tlcr in lllt'll' letter graded courses.
Dartmouth ('ollcge had a partial
pass-fail system, and did away
willi it termng it “educationally
unsound." Pass/fail advocates con-
tcnd that a "stem with high and
low passt. '. as bad as a tradition-
ally graded system.

Arguments on the optional S/U

 

system range from differences in

the meaning of the term "t to its
feasibility. Nontraditional grading
proponents claim that an optional
system would spell the end of the
S/U system. They feel that by
allowing a choice, students will
fear punishment if they opt for
S/U since they could lltht' chosen
the traditionally accepted A-E
system. Therefore students would
shy away from the S/U system.
What to Do

Whatever decision is made con-
ccrning S/U grading iit Albany one
thing is apparent - something must
be done The S/U system that is
currently in use bears no resem-
blance to the resolution passed by
the Senate in 1969. The system
was conceivud in haste. It took
months to complete all aspects of
the system. Questions of academic
honors and retention along with
others were not taken into consid
eration until after the Senate act-
ed in its "cart before the horse"
manner.

Disturbing questions concerning
graduate admissions and transfer
ring have been raised. As of yet,
no one has actually sat down to
sec if the students' educational
experiences have been improved
or have decayed under the new
system. Perhaps it is not the grad‘
ing system that should be at-
tacked. Changing ”A-C" to an "S"
min not be the piinecca for the
nation's or_ this university's educa-
tioniil woes.
