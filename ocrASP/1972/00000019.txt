Linda MulE. Freshman

I think that an S-U grading
system iii very good, especially for
freshmen. because it takes a lot
of the competitive pres-sure out.
of cliiisswork and, I think, gives ll
student the opportunity to get as
much or as little out of a course as
he or she wants, which is what
education truly should be. In
some respects, S-U grading might
tcntl to make students work a
little less when it C(llnlES to assign»
ments and tests, but this doesn't
mean that they're not [coming the
material. You can learn a lot more
by simply listi-ning to ll professor
and really concentrating on it luc-
luru, than you can by frantically
scribbling down every word he
says and not riiiilly hearing or
limiting anything.

 

...di sliaw

I think it would be ii good idea
to make either certain courses or ii
certain number of courses puss-fail
for freshmen and sophomores.
This would be the idea system,
because then students could take
courses in their major field for
grades (for later entrance into
graduate schools), and take other
courses, courses they just want to
take for no particular reason. on a
piissliiil basis. This would take
away it curtain amount of the
foam that students on piuis~fail
grading have, that they will be
denied admission to good gradu-
Iitc schools because of ii lack of
ﬁrst. and second-year grades; and
it would still give them an oppor-
tunity to trike certain non-major
roiiriicia pints‘fiiil.
