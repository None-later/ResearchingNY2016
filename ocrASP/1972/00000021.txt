Substitutes Push Danes Past Oneonta

by Bill Heller

The Great Danes stretched their
season record to 10-3, their leagUe
record to 4 1, and their home
win streak to 14, as they whipped
Oneonta, 64-57. The last time the
Danes lost at home was on Jan-
uary 23, 1971 to Marist.

Albany opened up quickly to an
11-6 edge in the first six minutes,
but then literally fell asleep. Three
layups off fast breaks paved a 10
point run by the Red Dragons
from 0n80nta, as they took a
16-11 lead. Oneonta maintained
the lead for the rest of the half;
but failed to completely take ad-
vantage of Albany's unusually
sloppy play, and found themselves
up by just three at halftime,
31-28.

The Danes opened up the sec-
ond half with ﬁve turnovers iind
fell behind 37-32 with 17:30 to
go in the game. This sent Coach
Sauers to his bench, as he brought
in Don Jess and Bob Rossi. Joss
promptly hit two field goals and
Rossi scored on a fast break to
close Oneonta's lead to 41-40,
with 13:00 left. Werner Kolln‘s
basket put the Danes in front for
good 42-4], but at the 11:00
mark the Danes led by just two,
45-43.

Willis Might Quit!

They then totally blew the Red
Dragons off the court with a 15-4
spurt. As Joss played great at both
ends of the court, John Quat-
trocchi got hot. Troch accounted
for three baskets on his own, but
once again it was his excellent

passing that led the way to a
60-47 advantage. Albany held the
thirteen point lead till 2:30, when
both coaches went to the bench.
Down 611-51, Oneonta scored six

too little and much too late.

Don Joss played a helluva game,

The Lonely Athlete

 

The ideal person is the one who
functions best alone, singly, in-
dividually. Even though man has
always tried to surround himself
with others of his kind, he has
always been alone. Look into
yourself. Can you truly say that
there is even one person who
knows you totally; inside and
out?

Sports has long been analogous
to life itself, and it is not sur-
prising to find the same loneliness
and singularity present in life,
existing in sport,

There are certain athletes in
certain sports that exemplify
tlicsc conditions, and il is not
surprising to find them in some of
the least watclicd and most ne-
glcclcd sports, Perhaps those

running .ilone out on a track, or wrestling In a

lit-cause they too achineg rcmind onc of one's own

tween individuals who meld into it single entity.

FSA Runs Food Factory

by John Fairliall

The chicken you eat at dinner

probably comes from Omaha,
Nebraska. So says Richard Finke,
the man who buys your food,
with your money, at the FSA
commissary.

Finke decides not only which
food to buy, but also prepares the
day-to-day menu by which you
live. Finke runs the massive com-
missary operation that supplies
the school with approximately
$2,000,000 worth of food each
year. Almost all the food the
quads use is trucked from the
commissary. Meat is cut, hambur-
ger patties are machine shaped,
and dessert, rolls and breakfast
donuts are baked. Vast amounts
of food are stacked, stored and
prepared in the drab white Service
building nearest to Stuyvesant Pla-

l0,000 Pounds of Beef

As Finke says, feeding Albany
State is like feeding a small city.
The four quads and the Campus
Center operations feed about

15,000 mouths. 'l‘hus, FSA ord-
ers, when possible, directly from
food producers and meat pact-n.“
from places even farther away
than Omaha, Nebraska. FSA must
order truckloads of meat to feed a
campus that consumes 3500
pounds of beat for one roast beef
dinner. To insure a ready supply,
between 5,000 and 10,000
pounds of beef are kept frozen.
ﬁt)-bt),(l0() pounds of turkey may
also be in freezers - Iurkcy must
be ordcrcd in the fall when it is
cheapest, and stored for the coin
ing year.

lb-2(l,(l(l(l pounds of hamburger
arc nccdcd for one Wt't'k at this
campus; and 1200 (‘tiscs of Cereal
a month, But these incredible
figures do not mean that students
must, suffer low quality food or
poorly prepared meals. in fact,
Finkc says that there is no cxcusc
for a lousy mcal; he insists he
ordcrs only the finest quality
f()()(l.

Assuming that tlic food doesn‘t
suffer in the short trip lictwccn

atable meals must be blamed on

the chefs. This is a point empha-
sized by Finke. If the chicken
doesn‘t taste right, it's not the
fault of the Nebraska producer or
the Commissary, it's a result of
bad cooking. Moreover, it is the'
responsibility of the chefs to have
enough of thc main dish on hand.
If the menu says there is a choice
between steak and liver, llicii you
have a right to complain. A stu-
dent who consistently cats late
should not haVc lo cal vcal cutlets

students to complain directly to
the chef or to the quad food
committee.

ieves SUNYA students are rela-

product that can be mixed with

More than any other candidate,
Jackson iiccds ii big Florida show-
ing to keep going. The entry of
Wallace has complicated the pic-
ture, and made Jackson‘s job
harder. But if the Washington
senator rims poorly, it will call
into question the basis of his
entire campaign, i.c. that the
Democrats can defeiit President
Nixon only by luring biick mil-
lions of conservative Democrats
who are disenchanted with the
party‘s liberalism.

finish ahead of McGovern.

one for Muskie. He faces Mc-
Carthy in a presidential preference
poll he is sure to win; it is the
contest for 170 delegate votes
that offer the significant test.
Muskie lieutenants hope to come
away with 100 or more.

McGoVern is Muskic's Illinois
rival, fielding delegates in most
districts, Humphrey is skipping
Illinois.

Muskie iii-eds ii substantial vic-
tory in Illinois, not oiin for the
delegates, but to overcome the
psychological impact of the set-
back his strategists fear in Florida.
