Armies of the Rig
to Rise Again

“SEE YOU IN
SAN DIEGO”

The Republican Party is coming
to San Diego complete with Rich
ard Nixon, Spiro Agnew, John
Mitchell and Billy Graham. Est
imates of the number of people
who will come to demonstrate
their dissatisfaction with the
Grand Old Party, range from the
San Diego Police Department‘s
100,000 to Jerry Rubin's
1,000.-000. While the city is pre-
paring for the Republicans' com-
fort, the San Diego Convention
Coalition is preparing to coordi-
nate the demonstrators into an
effective political force.

CONVENTION '72

To become the host city for the
convention San Diego had to
come up with sl.6 million for the
initial bid, $800,000 in cash. San
Diego almost dropped out of the
bidding until Nixon sent a semi-
‘public memo to Bob Finch saying
“Let’s put San Diego back into
the running." Bob Wilson, Nixon
crony and San Diego congress-
man, came to the rescue at this
point by securing $400,000 from
Sheraton Hotels Inc. Sheraton has
two hotels in San Diego and a
third under construction (all of
which would beneﬁt from an in-
ﬂux of conventioneers). The state
GOP committee came up with
$300,000 to round out the bid.

The money doesn't stop there.
At this point estimates for the
total cost of the convention are
running at about $5,000,000. This
includes $900,000 requested from
the Federal Government for riot
equipment and training.

THE CITY

While San Diego's power struc-
ture is gloating over the future
convention dollars that they hope
to bring into the restaurant. hotel
and tourist business, the local
population faces worsening eco-
nomic realities.

San Diego’s economy boomed
during the early 60's with its huge
defense plants, but now, with
fewer and fewer large defense
contracts, the city faces economic
crisis. San Diego has been the
scene of many labor disputes dur-
ing the last year. Many working
people are becoming increasingly
unhappy with their jobs and their
wages. There have been strikes or

bitter negotiations among the
longshoremen, Rohr Aircraft As-
semblage and the United Farm
Workers to name a few. Unem-
ployment is reaching epidemic
proportions fed by lay-offs and
firings, and the welfare system is
incapable of responding adequate-
ly.

DISSATISFIED

The youth population is dissat-
isﬁed, partly because of constant

olice harrassment and dope
busts. The dissatisfaction is be-
coming more and more organized.

Women's Centers, Women's
Study Groups, and Women’s Cau-
cuses have proliferated in the last
few years. Electoral evidence of
the effectiveness of the local wo-
men’s movement is shown by the
fact that one of the strong con-
tenders in the recent mayorial
primary was a woman.

The local Welfare Rights Chap-
ter is growing and is noticeably
unappreciative of the State's Gov-
ernor. (Reagon has been leading
attempts to cut back on welfare).

Black and Chicano papers have
increased their circulation and im-
pact, and many Third World Stu-
dent and Labor Organizations
have formed. The Pain Indians
have taken nearby Escondido to
court over water rights.

A strong GI movement has dev-
eloped in San Diego and is con-
stantly in the news protesting
unfair regulations and conditions.
Gl's regularly speak out against
their role in the war and civilian
support for them is growing. The
recent ‘Stop the Constellation
Vote‘, in which the overwhelming
majority voted for the Constel-
lation not to sail for Vietnam
duty, showed how much it has
grown already.

While C. Arnolt Smith (a close
friend of Nixon's and his largest
campaign contributor in '68) and
Pete Wilson. the new Mayor and
one of the "bright new faces" of
the Republican Party, try to pres-
ent San Diego as a sleepy, conserv-
ative paradise, the city has a grow
ing movement to contradict this
picture.

This growing movement was as
frustrated and confused as every-
one else in San Diego when the
news broke that the convention
was coming here. It was clear to
the movement that no one wanted
a replay of Chicago, yet people
wanted to effectively show the
world that the Republicans don't
represent the American people
and to evict Richard Nixon from
the White House.

 

Will those who tried to stop the war stop the Republican

Convention?

On October 3, a meeting be-
LWeen movement groups took
place at the DOOR (a San Diego
underground paper) House to dis-
cuss what could bc done. This
meeting was the first of many that
led to the formation of the San
Diego Convention Coalition.
There was nothing really concrete
to discuss at that first meeting, or
so it seemed. No one really had
any idea what the convention
meant--how much would have to
be done and what could be ac-
complished.

The Community Congress, and
association of liberal service- ori-
ented groups, many of which re-
ceive county funding, announced
that they were planning a conven-
tion of alternative cultures and
life styles to coincide with the
Republican Convention. Its pur-
poses would be to parallel and
ignore the Republicans and to be
“constructive instead of destruct-
ive.” Spokespeople for the idea
talked about a national organiz-
ation coming out of the alter-
native convention. Thcy said
that the convention would show
the real‘ 'problems to the world
One person who spoke rur tne
idea said that a lot of the needs of
the alternative convention had
been decided on but that setting
the mood and tenor of the event
might perhaps be left to the
groups at this meeting.

UNITED IN OPPOSITION

People at the meeting were
somewhat overwhelmed by this
proposal. Beyond the fact that
everyone there was united in op-
position to Nixon and the Repub-
licans, there were many different
political positions represented and
none of those had been discussed.

Most of the groups there wanted
to confront the Republicans in
some way, not ignore them.
People became very wary of the
alternative convention idea when
they found out that only one
meeting of the Community Con-
gress had been held to discuss
it.

As more ideas were talked about
it became apparent that a lot of
political discussion would have to
take place if the individual groups
were to act as a group to create a
successful united front against the

Republican Convention.

It was decided that the groups
would meet again in two weeks,
giving everyone time to talk
among themselves and decide
whether or not they would want
to work with other groups around
the convention.

At the second meeting it seemed
as though the concept of any type
of coalition was doomed before il
got off the ground, Essentially,
what happened was a four hour
debate between pro and con alter-
native con/cntion forces. It was
finally decided by a Ill-:l-il vote to
go to the Community Congress
and ask them not to hold lhc
alternatch convention at the
same limi- as i.i1t' Republican
one.

The discussion before the vote
revealed ii total lack of together-
mess in politics or direction, The
discussion referred to maili-
piilation by the city of the aller-
nntiw C(HIVt'IIilllll. Overall
there were tio COILSISLL‘III. argu»
ments for or against the alter-

 

Will the veterans of Chicago and Washington return to the streets?

native convention, only vague
charges and fears. Some of these
fears proved true in the ensuing
meeting with the Community
Congress. It turned out that Com
munity Congress hadn’t officially
sent anyone to the “onVention

meetings and the alternative
convention at that time was still
only a proposal. It was decided
that if the Community Congress
and The Coalition (in its form at
that time) would ever work to-
gether it would have to be a slow
evolving progress.

WHO IS
THE COALITION

The San Diego Convention Co-
alition seems to be the best hope
for San Diego in ’72 not to be a
replay of Chicago '68. In Chicago,
there was no real leadership or
planning among local people.
Almost all negotiations and pub
licity were handled by national
leaders who relied on a small
segment of the radical community
to handle the massive amounts of
work involved in putting on
demonstrations and the ill-fated
Festival of Life. In direct contrast
to that, the Coaliton has devel-
oped into a broad-based organiza-
tion with a local orientation.
Room has been left for national
ﬁgures on the steering committee,
but the bulk of people involved
will be from San Diego.

The Coaliton includes people
from six underground papers, wo-
men's and Third World groups,
representatives from the National'
Lawyers Guild, four groups of GI
counselors and organizers, stu-
dents, and people from a variety
of other community and social
change organizations.

Because the people in the Co-
nltion are local people, they are
interested in not only confronting
the Republicans but also living in
San Diego after the Republicans
leave town,

THE POLITICS
OF THE COALITION

One key area of discussion with-
in the Coalition has been over the
issuc of how to build a strong
radical mow-inan that cannot be
absorbed or CO‘Optt'd by the De
mocratic Party. li‘cars were voiced
by many members that, because
the Coalition was focussing on the
Republican strategy and policies,
this focus could be used by the
Democratic Party to build their
own btlsl‘. Althouin the question
has not been totally resolved in
the minds of many people, [In-
Coalition emerged with four
points that they felt will help
prevent being absorbed or co-
“pit-(i by the Democratic Party.

’l‘luI four points that tliil group
settled on are:

|. )Building “11' broadest pos-
rill)ll' Cotillion to non-violenllv
and openly oppose the Repub-

lican Party leadership. The C0-
alition had agreed to and is mak-
ing special efforts to include
individuals and organizations re-
presenting Third World people,
women, GIs and Veterans, work-
ing people, the unemployed, gay
people, students, and alienated
youths.

2.)In the Coalition and in all
Coalition projects, members have
agreed to struggle against all forms
of domination based on race, sex
or class exploitation.

3. )The Coalition is working to
establish contacts with groups
throughout the United States,

especially in the Western region.

4.)The members of the Co-
alition have agreed to discuss and
resolve all disagreements internal-
ly. No group in the Coalition is
bound to participate in the
actions of the whole Coalition,
but all have agreed not to publicly
oppose the decisions of the co-
alition or participating group.

JUST A BEGINNING

The Coalition is considering the
possibility of publishing a daily
newspaper during the convention
activitis.

Members of the Coalition have
taken great pains to stress that all
of th ideas being discussed for the
convention are, at this time, only
tentative. They say that they
welcome ideas and input from
organizations and individuals from
all over the country.

One member of the Coalition,
who asked not to be identified,
summed up what seems to be the
feeling throughout the movement
in San Diego, “We do not want
just another anti-war action, but
we’ll be working to construct a
life-sustaining organization of
people across the country, and
particularly people in San Diego
who wantto change their present
circumstances. While we feel tha
actions in San Diego will haVe
national and international im-
plications. Members of the coali-
tion have a commitment to the
people of San Diego. We live here.
We work here. We are close to the
people here. We‘ll be here after
the convention."

would mean that the city univer-

history.

No one at the Education Depart~
mcnt could specifically pinpoint
what the tuitwn might be for next

ded in this report. A spokesman
for the department stressed that

Regents do not set tuition since
that is the duty of the SUNY

private institutions to provide

dent from this income bracket

The Regents called upon univer-
sity administrators to seek “neces-
sary economies," and directed the
institutions to halt the spiraling
cost of education by striving to
increase efficiency.

The report indicated the State
Education Department had al-
ready taken steps to deal with the
financial crisis threatening to over-
take the state's educational facili-
ties. They cited the imposed one
year moratorium on all new doc-
toral programs and the depart-
ment‘s reevaluation of the profes-
sional requirements for teacher
certification as attempts to in-
crease efficiency by weeding out
unnecessary courses and determin-
ing the cost-effectiveness and val-
uc of the programs.
