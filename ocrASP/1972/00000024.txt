Salaries Big Issue
for Central Council

by Allen Altman

Central Council exploded into debate over a bill Thursday night that
Proposed to establish salaries for Student Association and CentralCo«
uncil Officers. The bill proposed that each Coordinator be piiltl $150.
that the Business Operation‘s Administrator be paid $150. that the
Chairman of Central Council be paid $300, and that the Vice-Gilm-
mﬂn' of Central Council be paid $150. Each salary WOllld be
established retroactively to September 197]. Michael Lanipert.
PreSIdent of Student Association, introduced the bill.

Lampert cited the precedent set in 1963 when the president’s salary
was first instituted as justification for the bill, At that time the salary
was VieWed as a token of appreciation for the president's services and
as an encouragement not lo have a part-time job. Council felt that the
president couldn‘t hold an outside job and still he an effective
president. Today the President‘s salary is $700 while the Vice
President's salary is $400 per academic year.

In response to Lampert's hill, Council Member Jack Schwartz
Proposed an amendment to give Central Council Members a salary of
$100 a term, and commented that, “we want a piece of the action
also". This was defeated by unanimous vote after a short debate.

Council Member Jody Widelitz, speaking in opposition to the bill,
said that all the officers knew what they were getting into before they
were elected. Festus Joyce, Vice-Chairman of Central Council, said
that he could not accept the salary if he was part of voting it in
himself.

Rick Iiese, Chairman of Central Council, speaking in favor of the
bill cited the fact that he would have to resign in order to take a
part-time job if his salary wasn't instituted. He explained that it was
impossible to serve as Chairman of Central Council and hold a
part-time job at the same time.

The final version of the bill included an amendment introduced by
Council Member Jay Shusterhoff that would set up a committee to
investigate the present salaries paid by Student Association. At this
point Council member Ken Stokem proposed to form a committee to
investigate the particular topics of the bill and report back in one or
two weeks. This was quickly passed with a unanimous vote.

Central Council referred to Finance Committee an appropriation
request of $3,550 for Grassroots. Grassroots would become a
conservative bi-weekly publication which would offer an alternative
to the present University publications according to Council member
Debbie Smith, introducer of the bill. Mitch Frost, Grassroots
supporter, said that the budget and operation of Grassroots would be
identical to Sweet Fire‘s. Grassroots will utilize material from such
sources as the Conservative Party, US Senator Buckley's office, and
Young Americans for Freedom in order to express its view.

Rising Interest in UrbanAffairs
Leads to Second Field Program

by Mindy Altman

Behause of a mounting interest
in urban affairs on the part of
students and their increasing
awareness of the problems of our
society iind civilization, there has
now been established an
interdepartmental Second field in
urban affairs. The program is
effective this semester, and the
selection committee is headed by
Paul Marr,Associate Professor of
Geography

The program, which proposes to
be interdisciplinary, includes
many urban and
community-oriented
undergraduate courses from the

departments of Afro-American
studies, art, economics,
geography, physics, political

science, and sociology. Marr, who
teaches urban studies courses and
who has had students interested
for some time in a program of this
nature, says that the

         

   

field will “provide students with
an active outlet for their interest
in urban affairs." The courses are
concerned with aspects of urban
life. conditions, government,
development and planning.

According to the committee,
each of the participating
disciplines has particular strengths
which tend to complement work
in related academic fields, and
therefore it is recommended that
students taking the second field in
urban affairs work from at least
three of the departments. The
committee has stated that
“selecting courses from at least
three fields will broaden the
student’s understanding of urban
and community affairs and
prepare him with a better
perspective with which to
specialize in a related topic in his
major undergraduate discipline, in
graduate studies, or in work
following graduation."

The unit requirements for a
second field are 18 to 24 credits.
At least six credits of the total
must consist of prerequisite
courses or courses at the 300 level
or higher.

According to Marr, the program
is flexible at this point, but
conforms to the requirements of
the Second field as approved by
the university. As fccdlinck is

obtained during the semi-slur

about the success of the courses,
there will be a review by ;.

SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (LNS) -
When the six San Quentin inmates
charged with murder in the killing
of two prison guards at the time
George Jackson was murdered ap-
peared in court on January 2-l,
they greeted the courtroom with ii
loud “Power In tho People."
Then, one of the brothers, David
Johnson, read a statement that
they had called an end to a hunger
strike that had been going on for
almost a week at San Quentin’s
Adjustment Center (“the hole,"
or segregation section of San
Quentin).

"We have ended the strike, but
not the struggle," Johnson read.
“With the support of the people
we shall emerge victorious.
Veneeremos. The Prisoners of the
San Quentin Adjustment Center."

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1972

  
   
 

The San Quentin Adjustment
Center seems well on its way to
becoming the most famous prison
block in the country -- a hotbed in
the growing surge of rebellion
inside tliLI jails of the United
States and the home of ii growing
list of determined and articulate
revolutionary inmates.

The hunger strike which began
on January 211 among the San
Quentin Six and other inmates in
the Adjustment Center and in B
section (maximum security sec-
tion) brought attention to some
of the immediate grievances of
prisoners in San Quentin.

The prisoners' demands covered
food, exercise, mailing, education,
medical treatment, religion and
the commissary. Most of the
demands asked nothing more than

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

that the prisoners in the Adjust-
ment Center be given the same
"privileges" as the prisoners in the
rest of San Quentin u like seeing
their visitors without chains and
shackles, having one cup of milk a
day, liavingaccess to the library in
the building, being allowed to buy
the same things the mainline
population can at the Commissary.

“Desperate men, but we are
reasonable," they said in their
demands. “We are not asking for
privileges. We are demanding our
rights to keep our physical and
mental hygiene up to par. As
reasonable men we feel that it
should not be necessary to tear up
things, burn and throw feces on
YOU in order to obtain our
human rights."

The response of the prison of-

San Quentin Still a Hotbed of Struggle

l‘iciiils was to throw at least one
man into a strip ccll (bare cell
with no light with just a can to
shit in). Others were tear gassed.
Reading and writing material was
withheld for five days. Guards
threw water on the prisoners re-
peatedly and turned off the heat.
(The window panes have been out
since August.)

Though the prisoners told
guards not to bring them any
'ood, it was brought as a way to
break down their resistance. When
the tear gas came, prisoners hurled
the food to fight. back. There was
nothing else left in their cells since
all their personal property had
been taken out at the beginning of
the strike.

Aside from focussing attention
on some of the grievances of the

Adjustment Center inmates, the

Goy Alliance Offers Alternatives

by Sharon Cohen

The problems that they encoun-
tered as homosexual individuals
prompted several Albany State
students to form the SUNYA Gay
Alliance last October,

The objectives, problems, ac-
complishmcnts, and plans of the
Alliance were outlined for me by
Gary and Mary, two of the coordi-
nators. They both feel that al-
though the University itself takes
no official stand on homosexuiit
ily, “the university commutiin
iii-eds Il.\ consciousness raised,"
and that mic of IIH‘ plii‘puscs of
the Gay Alliaiicc is to “educate

almost completely overshadowed
by George Jackson‘s death and
the prison officials shifting stories
and denials as to what really
happened.

George Jackson was killed ended
with five others dead: three

hearing on prison brutality.
The hearing at which the Six

announced the end of their
.iunger strike followed a similar
pattern dragging to a complete
halt within less than an hour of
the time it began.

Johnny Larry Spain presented
the judge with a writ which
charged that his court-appointed
attorney, Koolpe was an “agent of
the state." In fact, Koolpe even
submitted a declaration under
oath stating that he did say, “I
am, as we all are, part of the
conspiracy against you." Koolpe
later said he had been joking.
“Are the indictments a joke,
too?” commented a spectator.
The judge, howaver, didn't feel
that Koolpe’s comments war-
rented his removal from the case.
He turned down the writ without
even looking at. it.

Johnny Larry Spain then made a
motion to disqualify the judge for
prejudice. The others agreed with
his motion as did all the court
appointed attorneys. The chal-
lenge was made on the grounds
that Judge McGuire made a de-
cision (he denied the writ) on
Johnny's motion without reading
it. The challenge further states
that the judge is racially
prejudiced because he did not
appoint black or brown attorneys
nor did he appoint the attorney
requested by the prisoners.

Bruco Bales. the DA. said that
Spain's documents had no facts in
them. "it's what I'd expect
coming from Spain or any of
them," he said.

Due to pressure from the
defendants and their court ap-
poinch lawyers, Judge McGuire,
in an attempt to look fair and
imparlial agrccd that there were
facts in the documents and ac-
(‘cpti-d llic challenge. Now Judge
McGuire will altempt to justify
his actions and another judge will
li ca r lcslinionies from both
parties, All other proceedings will
be suspcndcd until this issue is
sctllcd.

In the meantime, the six are in
tlic Adjustment Center until the
state at some point decides that
along with people like Ruchcll
Mogcc and John Cluchetlc there's
too much of a risk in keeping
them all there together. Certainly
the hunger strike demonstrated to
prison officials, if they liiid ever
wondered, that the spirit and
actions of rebellion lives on in the
Adjustment Center and won't be
squashed.
