MIAMI, Fla. (CPS) - Anti-social
acts by students can be expected
by colleges that de-cmphasize con-
tact sports such as football, says a
prominent Florida University
psychiatrist.

In a recent interview in the
National Enquirer, Dr. Richard E.
Gordon, professor of psychiatry
at the University of Florida, and
co-author of “The Blight on the
Ivy,” and “The Split—Level Trap,"
said that “when competitiVe
Sports such as football are de-
emphasized, a vacuum is created
that is filled by other activities -
primarily, in my experience, by
more delinquency, deviance, and
anti-social violent behavior."

“There are positive character-
building values in such sports,“
says Gordon - “teamwork, train-
ing, self-discipline, effort. Today's
ballplayers are probably the most
self-controled, neat and respectful
of all college st udents."

Carnegie Commission:

Education Report

(CPS) - According to a recent
Carnegie Commission on Higher
Education study American college
and university students are gearing
their studies to vocational goals.

Undergraduate enrollment in
such fields as pro-medicine, pre-
law, psychology, journalism,
social work, and nursing hich
risen notably this fall.

Generally, the current economic
condition is reflected additionally
in the shift away from enrollment
in such areas as engineering, edu-
cation, iind physics. There recent-
ly has been ii sharp drop in
employment opportunities in
these fields.

The Carnegie study shows that
the number of new students enter-
ing biology this fall was up by 16
percent over last year’s number in
a survey of 357 institutions.

There is still a shortage of
trained medical personnel and
medical schools report a dramatic
rise in applications.

At Harvard, the number of
biology majors rose 30 percent
over last year, And enrollment. in
organic chemistry, a prerequisite
fro medical school, has doubled in
two years.

On the other hand, enrollment
in subjects severely affected by

the economic slowdown has
dropped drastically.

For example, enrollment in
aeronautical engineering at the
Massachusetts Instititte of 'l'eeh~
nology has dipped from (in?
students in 106!) to IlHFi this year.

At the same time there has been
an increase in enrollment in
oriental languages courses despite
the overall shift away from for
cign languages studies. Stanford
University reports over the past
two years the number tifts'llult'tlls
enrolled in Chinese and Japanese
language courses has increased by
25') percent.

Journalism and communication
arts are among the most rapidly
growing areas of study even when
the news industry is sullen-ing
severe cutbacks in personnel.
Journalism enrollment at the lllli-
versity of Wisconsin leaped from
181 last semester to 2.16 this fall.

Other areas now enjoying an
increased popularity, according to
the Carnegie study, are i-cologi.
iirhan studies, city planning, .igri
culture and theology.

llowevcr, i-tliiiii‘ studies, Wlllt'll

To the Editor:
Well, the good governor is at

it again. Tuition is going up. In
the past, SUNY tuition has been
used to pay off bonds that finance
dormitory construction. However,
the governor has anntiunCcd that
dormitory building is to be sus-
pended as is the construction of
additional class iind office space.
As the antithesis of Robin Hood
and his merry men, Governor
Rockefeller hiid the State Legis-
lature seem to be making a hiibit
of taking from the poor and giving
to the rich. Probably the oiily
thing this state had to offer to its
economically disadvantaged and
lower middle class citizuns was its
state supported schools, 'l‘liese
colleges and universities enabled a
student with limited financial re-
sources available to obtain a
quality education at a signi-
fi'antly lower cost than if he or
she were to attend a private uni-
versity.

However, this benefit is about to
end. In announcing the tuition
increase, Governor Rockefeller
spoke ‘of bringing our tuition
more in line with those of private
universities in order to save these
prestigious schools from bank-
ruptcy, In other words, our
tuition is to go up so that the rich
ciiii continue to send their off-
spring to New York University,
Columbia and Cornell,

With another election rapidly
approaching, it is finally time for
the voters in this state to realize
that the state legislature is not
really sympathetic to the needs of
the electorate and that Governor
Rockefeller is more interested in
building useless highways and in
completing the monument to him
self in downtown Albany than in
trying to relieve the burden from
the already heavily burdened tax»
payer. It is true that the fiscal
