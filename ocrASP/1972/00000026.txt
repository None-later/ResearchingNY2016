Everyday Myths . . .

Editor’s note: is it true that women are poor job risks
because they are always quitting to get married? Does "the
little lady” hold down ajob just to be able to afford that
new hat or a weekly trip to the beauty shop?

These are only two of the many myths about working
women which are widespread in the United States. Unfortu-
nately they often affect a woman’s chances offindingajob
and once employed they keep her from even the most basic
Job security and benefits. not to mention a salary equal to
her fellow male employees.

But a woman‘s lowly position in the labor force has not
always been as it is today. During World War ll for instance
many many women were eagerly given previously “male
only jobs" to compensate for all those men who were
drafted into the armed forces. But once the war was over
and the job market tight with returned veterans, women
were suddenly no longer qualified. They were fired and
urged back to the home,
occupations.

family, and more “feminine

The following are only a few of those myths about

working women - and the statistics to prove them false -

About Women

MYTH: Women on welfare don’t want to work. They just
want to live offthe taxpayer's money.

Women on welfare who want to work, as well as
non-welfare women, have the difficulty of finding adequate,
inexpensive day care. One woman we know took home 890
a week and paid $32 a week for day care for on e child.
Since a welfare mother is rarely paid even the minimum
wage, the added cost of child care would just about eat up
her paycheck, leaving her right back where she started -
dependent on welfare. (Nixon recently signed into effect a
new welfare law which requires all those “able-bodied"
welfare recipients to work-without provisions for day care
facilities.)

AHMI'H: li’onicn arc hurl hiring risks; they (“'0 often out

because o_/‘illnc.<.\'.

A 1968 Public Health Survey shows that men, on the
average, lost 5.4 days during the survey year because of
illness or injury while women lost 5.3 days.

MYTH: ll'oiiien arc not interested in joinng unions

licciinxc they xcc their primary role as in the home.

There are twenty-five million wimgaiiiaed women workers in the
United States and yet, the larger, male-dominated unions
have not sought to bring these women the protection of
organization.

Many unorganized women are farm workers (500,000),
domestic workers (1.7 million), and service workers (4.7
million.) These occupations have a predominance of black,
Puerto Rican, chicana, and oriental women. Racism coupled
with the small and sometimes isolated nature oftlieir work
makes organizing more difficult, but all the more essential.

()tlier unorgzuiized women workers, like clerical workers,
are persuaded by their bosses that their jobs are "better"
than manual jobs in a shop and therefore unions are beneath
their status.

However, in most places, clerical workers have less job
security and take home a smaller pay envelope than women
in the production unit of the same firm.

Two thirds of all women workers are clerical workers,
private household workers, waitresses. cooks, and teachers
(except college).
