Essence Pantomime Troupe on the PAC Stage

tain and urtprepared for what was
to come. The exercise was halted
by a fanfare, and the company
assembled to a march played on
kazoos. At this point the evening
appeared as if it would be one of
“Gimmick Theater". replacing
creativity with shock value and
talent with cliein tricks. but once
I accepted the falsity of my first
impressions it was easy to enjoy
the ten beautifully executed skits
that followed.

None of this could have been
done in standard theater. A mime
group. “in the (heck tradition“
relies on body and facial espres-
sioti to communicate arty spoken
dialogue is incidental. Because of

by Michael Lippman

It is always unsettling to enter
the theater for a performance and
find the actors already on stage;
one can almost be intimidated. as
if the audience has interrupted a
ritual which was going on before
it entered and now must pay
humble tribute. The black-tight
white-face figures seemed unaware
of an expectant audience as they
went through their “Free Iixer-
cise," a spontaneous silent
demonstration of lluid motion.
This was pleasing to the eye btit
only built tip suspense in the mind
- I could picture this going on all
night arid the question “What
happens next?" became all
important .

Ulllll last I'i‘iday's pei'loiiiiauce
of the Iissence Mime Troupe I had
had little experience with the art
of pantomime (“try to hear what

I‘m not saying") and was uneer:

Lively Workshop Follows Mime Show

Katie Friedland

The Essence Mime Theater is a
troop of young men and women
so in control of their supple bod-
ies that their every movement
seems simple arid effortless,

After the production. however.
once the stage was lit and swarm-
ing with volunteers responding to
director Benny Reehl‘s invitation
to the audience to ruin in a
workshop. the talents and perse-
verance ot' the actors became lip»
pareril. The members of the cout-
party (“those with the funny
white faces." as Reelil piit it)
dispersed themselves atiiorig the
volunteers to demonstrate as
Reelil led the participants through
"sortie e\eicises :iud illusions pisl

arm isolation. they were told to
pretend that they were on ii mov-
ing bus or suban and had to

move from pole to pole.

One of the most r‘alistie illu-
sions. is also, according to Rechl.
one of the simplest. To create the
illusion of being walled in, Reehl
had the volunteers isolate both
their hands (as thottgli they were
resting against a wall) and walk
between them. While groping.
“never move both hands at the
same titiie be instructed. “or the

audience loses track of where the
illusion is. Always watch the hand
that you keep still. and be careful
not to walk past the ‘wall‘ once
yoti have established it."

In ntdet to give the illtision of
walking in place. the students

were told to keep their bodies
level and to move only those areas
below the waist. Reeltl demonstra-

right foot in front and movrrig up
on the pad of his foot. and then.
while slowly gliding his right boot
back. sliding his left foot oirt.

The workshop ended with all
the participants rolling around the
ﬂoor together iii an exercise called
reflections. “It’s similar to Follow
the Leader.“ Reehl explained.
“but you tiiiist suppress your pers-
onality so that you cart follow
immediately.“ The object of the
exercise is to try to figure out
what kind of character the leader
is ‘vorking With and then to Illll~
tate his actions as simultaneously
as possible.

members of the workshop walked
out of the theater trying to master
the technique of reﬂections.
