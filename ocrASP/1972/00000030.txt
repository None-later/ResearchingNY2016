’70 ActIVISm Becomes '1

1972 Indifference

by Maidu Oringher

Many students remember the discontent of Spring 1970'. Many were
present when classes were suspended to allow time for dlulogues and
workshops aimed at improving education and meeting the problemsof
this University. 1970 students were enthusiastic and actively partici-
pated in University affairs and government. .

Next Monday one of the dreams of those 1970 students Will be
realirerl. The-Council of the College of Arts and Sciences will
eonv1-n1- ~11 council which encourages student participation and may
have lhepower 1.11 el‘t'eel great changes in University policy. The
Count-1| will assist in making budget allocations, will make recom-
mendations 1.1) 1111- University Council on Promotions and Continuing
Appointments. and will take part in the formation of course
curriculum.

111 1972 the clenchl'd fists havr- disappeared. Finding jOhs, avoiding
the draft, and passing courses seem to be more important issues to
these 15172 students. Unfortunately, due to this lack of interest in
University government, opportunities for change and revision within
the University may be lost.

POTENTIAL POWER

The potential powers of the Council are great. Dr. Kendall Birr,
Interim Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and
Acting Chairman of the Council, said, “powers are almost impossible
to write into by-laws with the hope of being effective...by-laws
establish the framework within which various kinds of action can be
taken." _ ‘

Birr explained that traditions must build up as dec1slons are made.
“Through the years," he said, “the University Senate has developed
areas of responsibility; they now clearly have say on curriculum and
degree requirements...whereas the role of the Council on Promotions
and Continuing Appointments is still in the process of evolution.

FEW CAME TO VOTE

Elections were held ltist December to elect the nine undergraduates
arid six graduate students specified by the by-Iaws of the Arts and
Sciences Council. The highest undergraduate candidate received seven
votes; some of the representatives were elected by one or two votes.
Birr commented on the lack of student support. "Many feel that the
University is overorginized; you reach a certain point where you feel
it is no longer worth your time and energy."

Birr went on to say that "faculty, students, and other people always
want to be consulted and involved and always want to be. part. of the
decision-making process, but iii any complex institution, such as this
University, to do that requires substantial committmi-nt of time and
energy. '

Michael Lanipert. President of Student Association, has his own
reasons IUI' lhepoorv1111-rt.ilrli-otit.. 111- said that the elections ere held
too close 111 finals, and the people didn’t understand what. the Coulicrl
was to do, ()111- st udeut told this reporter that she didn‘t vote because
the i-Ii-etons weren't publicized enough; "the ASP had advert tied the
elections a Week hel'ore 'I‘hanksgiving reei-ss, but when the students
returned to school they forgot to vote."

SllII-"l‘INC PRIORITIES

The 11171) students Would probably have glv1-ii the eletioiis priority
over finals, would hav1- the questioned the purpose of the Council,
and wollld IiaVe i‘elneliihen-rl to vote. There are many reasons for this
change in interest. The National political siluation may haVe had an
adverse affect on student interest in campus politics. Men with low
(Iral't numbers may he more worried about getting a deferment than
about changing UlliVi-rsily curriculum. Prospective teachers may be
more concerned with finding jobs than with making sure a SUNYA
professor gets promoted.

ng the Spring of I970 a two-day moratorium of classes was held to allow time for dialogues aimed

    

at meeting the problems of this University. One of the problems discussed was the increase of Student

representation in Campus Government. The Council of Arts and Sciences may achieve this goal.

Consistent with the lack of stu-
dent voter action, Lampert said
that he didn’t receive a sufficient
number of applications to fill the
positions. Birr reasoned that the
by-Iaws were written two years
ago, and “since it has not been a
highly visible or public issue, peo-
ple in the College of Arts and
Sciences are unconscious of its
existence."

PLANS INTERRUPTED

In 1969 a faculty committee
was elected by the faculty of the
College of Arts and Sciences to
prepare a set of by-laws. Although
the by-Iuws were completed by
February, 1970, action was halted
due to campus unrest that spring.

This delay in action may account,
in part, for the lack of student
interest.

During the full of 1970, the
plans were again interrupted by a
proposal to break up the College
of Arts and Sciences into three
separate colleges— Humanities,
Natural Sciences and Math-
emutics, and Social Science. The
final decision to retain the College
of .Arts and Sciences was not
made until February of 197]. At
that time, the by-laws were re-
vived 11nd ratified by a faculty
referendum. Faculty response,
Birr pointed out, was "distress-
ineg small," Faculty indifference
to campus government seems to
be equal to that of students.

The problem of elections was

turned over to the Presidents of
Student Association and Graduate
Student Association. Birr said that
the faculty has accepted the
"principle" of student representa-
tion on the Council, but “didn't
have the faintest idea how such
students would be identified."
The by-Inws state that student
representatives must. be academi-
cally advised by members of the
College of Arts and Sciences. But
according to Lampert, “the best
computer list with regard to ma-
jors is only 70% accurate." (Two
of the student. representatives
chosen do not have any major
listed.)

The first meeting of the Council
will be held on Monday, February
