i dispersed Thursday as the sun shone down on
‘, Emperor Hirohito of Japan and a throng of 50,000

WASHINGTON (AP)-— The Nixon administration
is making contingency plans to help the United
Nations feed or resettlc 2.5 million people who
want to leave Bangladesh, and millions waiting to
return there.

Administration aides say U.S. government and
private humanitarian aid to the Asian Sllbt'mtitll'm
has topped $250 million, most of it channeled
through the United Nations.

India estimates another $122 million is necessary
to pity the cost of returning three million to four
million refugees from India to their homes in
Bangladesh.

President Nixon has requested $250 million for
emergency relief in South Asia during the present
year but the House of Representativr-s has appropri-
ated only $175.

men's Caucus are both extremely
disappointed.

The Committee is an outgrowth
of the Afﬁrmative Action Plan.
Chaired by Edy Cobane and res-
ponsible to Vice-president Hartley.
the committee was organizod to
aid in the recruitment of women.
Their report to Hartley. 3””
meeting Monday, reflects their
displeasure with the Plan’s opera-
tion. The committee is preparing a
letter requesting that Hartley ex‘
plain why an earlier committee’s
suggestions for Affirmative Ac-
tion, submitted last June. were
never responded to (or included in
the Affirmative Action Plan the
university adopted.) That com-
mittee‘s suggestions were far more
specific than the broader Affirmzc
tive Action Plan that Cobane says
“sets no goals that are specific."
(‘oliane's committee also seeks to
have a woman appointed, full-
time, to monitor the university's
efforts to end discrimination
against women.

The committee is writing llart~
ley because the Affirmatch action
Plan is his responsibility. Opera-
ting under Hartley, and actually
administering the Plan, is Leon
('alhoun, Director of the Ofﬁce of
Equal Employment Opportunity.
(Fallioun acts as a watchdog on the
university‘s efforts to end discri-
mination, and he is supposed to
rcpurt to lIartIi'y iill problems
interfering with the Plan‘s effcc»
tivt'ncss. Tallioun was present at
the cunimittee meeting and agreed
that a woman should be sought to

mic year. This ﬁgure was worked
out by Vice-President Sirotkin as a
reasonable goal in View of the
budget crisis that prevents crea-
tion of new job positions. How-
ever, additional minority members
and women will not be distributed
evenly across the academic divi-
sions. The Humanities Division,
according to Ruth Schmidt, Asso-
ciate Dean for Humanities, must
account for four of the intended
gain of ten minority members and
women. Humanities must account
for more than its share of new
employment when, says Schmidt,
the division already has one of the
best records in employment of
women. In other words, in other
divisions dominated by white
males the percentage of women
and minority members employed
will not rise very much. ’I‘hus,
women will still tend to be con-
centrated within particular divi<
sions - a pattern of employment
frowned upon by HEW.

WASHINGTON (CPS)— An
istounding 36% of the newly
eligible lH-ZO-year-old voters have
already registered, accroding to a
recent surbey by the Youth Ci-
tizenship Fund.

The assessment was based on the

vey of registration officials in 102

of the Youth Citizenship Fund, a
bipartisan clearing house for the
youth registration movement. pre-
dicted recently that at least 60%
of the newa enfranchised voters
will be registered in time for the
general elections in Novumbcr.

About, 68% of the 18-20 year-
olds would add seven million new
voters for the presidential elect
ions. Another l-l million first time
presidential voters who liiive
turned 21 since l96tl also will be
added.

The youth registration was
aboVe 50% in several locales. in‘
cluding New York City.
