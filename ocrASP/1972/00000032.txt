Editorial

Last month the ASP published an editorial chastising the
Environmental Studies Steering Committee for its lack of
progress in establishing environmental studies courses here.
Among the reasons we gave for this inaction were limited
administration, support and enthusiasm. a lack of communi-
cation amongadministratorsinvolved with the program. and
the tight financial situation.

Since the time that editorial was published, additional
information of considerable import concerning the history
of the Steering Committee has come to our attention. Most

important among this information has been the revelation

that there existed at different time three separate Environ-

mental Studies Steering Committces. The first one was
formed in December of 1970, but collapsed during March of

that year because of a great divergence of opinion on

whether students or faculty should have the greater voice in

determining how the program should be set up.

After the collapse of this first committee, Vice-President

Sirotkin appointed another committee with this satire

inherent defect; the committee members were simply unable

to cooperate. By July of last year this second committee had

collapsed, too.

Another factor contributing to the lack of progress has

been the limited amount of funds. More important, however.

has been the University's mistaken impression that outside

lutids can be relied upon to finance progrartis of this nature.

The administration committed itself to the establishment of

environmental studies courses, but then proceeded to rely

l‘lllllt‘l_\' on outside grants to back tip this pledge. 'l'hesc were

to coiiie primarily from the National Science I’ouiidatioti. It

was Llllllt.‘ ClL‘rll’ [llilI our L‘llilllCL‘h (if l‘L'L‘L'lVlllL’. il L’J’illll were

minimal. particularly since otrr School of (Iriiiiiual lusttce

had just received a sizable grant from the NSF.

Apparently, the administration has not learned that “to get

things done. you have to do it yourself." The University
should not pledge to institute a prograrii if it knows full well
that it has no funds of its own with which to fiiiatice it.

We are not saying that the Steering (Iotninittec should have

shown results immediately after its formation. There were

several legitimate obstacles which prevented quick action

from being taken, including the many administrative changes

and the problems inherent in mobilizing the entire university

for such an effort. Furthermore. we cannot expect that all of

the committee members should have or cotrld have been iii

perfect agreement on how the prograiri should be structured.

We do feel. however. that the tactics of certain key

committee members adversely affected the programs's prog

ress. Specifically. We cite what one student called “the

dictatorial manner" in which the cll.lll'til.iti ran the meetings.

and the allegations that "certain issues were trot to he

discussed" sticli as “who should tlt‘tc‘l'llllllc' how thc pi‘ogi'aiii

WtiLlltl be structured fat ulty or students."

The fact that the true history oftlrr nintroniiic-rrtal studies

program has been kept secret harms the credibility ot the

Mr. Al Senia:

The ﬁrst page story iii your issue

qualiﬁcations and integrity, Willi
regard to the former, my record
speaks for itself. My colleagues are
well aware of my long. honorable

will survive your ill-considered
attack.

Your second charge is most
serious. You porrrt out that in my
prior position as Assistant l)ii'cc~
tor of the New York State but
sion of llic Bridget (not Deputy
Director as your article stated) I
played a major role in determining
SUNYA‘s budget. You go on to
state that “the entire matter has
resulted iit serious accusations of
conﬂict of interest being lodged
against Donald Axelrocl."

~lth, a senator must live on the
quad he is representing. This
forces him either to spend two
years on a quad he originally may
have wanted for only one or to
spend another year on a quad he
may have grown to dislike - Just so
he can retain his seat. in the
Senate. Students switching quads
would have no say in who their
senators were for one full year if
those senators were serving llll'll‘
second year in office.

As we all can see, in the long
run, the two year term for student
senators takes- away from students
llH‘ right to Vote for, or be, a
candidate for certain seats under
many of these circumstances. A
two year term diminishes student

I feel it necessary to comment
upon two articles in the ASP of

First, Dr. Hood antl the m

atypical of many universities

But the article mentions llll'
infirmriry having seen in students

cocaine. if they have sc-i-ii our-
case of addiction to cocaine. this
is medical history; cocaine is not
an addictive drug. Highly lirrhit

“Even the best teachers. with the best intentions, seem to
diminish their students as they work throuin the public
school system. For that system is, at bottom, designed to
produce what we sometimes call good citizens but what
more often than not turn out to be good soldiers: it is
through the schools of the state. after all. that we produce
our armies. I remember how struck l was while teaching at a
state college by the number of boys who wanted to oppose
the draft but lacked the courage or strength to simply say
no. They were trapped: they had always been taught. had
