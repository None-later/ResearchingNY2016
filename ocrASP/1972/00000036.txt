In a recent article that rcvrewcd laincison lake and l’alnicr's latest
album. l’fi'lllrt‘s' III an lair/iilrni'on, the writer \yondcrcd as to the
reactions of a classical music fan to this sort ol work, As a
selllproclainicd member of this select gioiip i will attempt to answer
his question along wrtli bi iiigiiig up some points ol my own.

For those of you as yet iinfaniiliai Willi this album. a very
unfortunate situation which should be rectified as soon as possible. it
cotts‘i . of “Pictures at an lixlubiiiou," a work by Miissoigsky
(IKJ‘HKHI) for piano which had been prcvrously adapted for the
orchestra by Ravcl earlier this century. in iltltltlltttl, thrown III at the
end was an encore performance (the whole album is live from a single
concert) of “Nutrockci,” liiiicrsoii, lake and l’alnier's rock-1am.
version of 'fchaikovaky's March from the Ntllt‘l‘rlt'ki‘l‘.

This piece is definitely the standout of the album, It is fresh and
vibrant owing riiucli of its success to its staccato rhythm imposed
upon the melody and hillcllt) ltkl: bursts of guitar This contrasts
superbly With the more tlowrng. subdued traditional version.

As for Miissorgsky‘s work. their rendition is extremely faithful to
the original except for their excellently doiic drum and guitar
unprovrsatious.’l'lic standout here has got to be the mellow, haunting
organ and moog used throughout the album.

As it was pointed out in the article this is not the first attempt at
incorporating classical iniisrc into a rock medium or Visa versa.

For the best in community theatre, you might want to go over to
Schenectady and catch the Civic Players’ production of DRACULA
(playing Friday and Saturday nights and Sunday afternoon). Some
ﬁne acting, excellent technical effects, and a sense of playing the show
as written in 1927 instead of camping it up  I.F.G.’s and Albany
State Cinema‘s film this week is very important for an understanding
of trends in film of the '60's and '70'3. Pasolini’s MEDEA starring
Maria Callas in her first dramatic role. Reviews in New York haVe been
mixed. Should be worth ii look, and the price ($1) is right... Tix for
