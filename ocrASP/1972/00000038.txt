ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

TAlbany Alumnus Runs for

Assembly as “Reform Democrat”

by Glenn von Nostitz

On a platform of "open the
legislature" 1971 Albany State
graduate Stephan Villano has
announced his candidacy for the
State Assembly from Albany‘s
103rd district as a “reform Demo-
crat."

“Has our government become a
government for the people iii
power?" is the central question of
Villiino's campaign, and he has
been gathering evidence which he
feels indicates that our state
government is controller“ by a few
men for their personal aggran-
dizement. This question of “who
runs the legislature" has led Vil-
lano to make many far-reaching,
and to some people, drastic pro-
posals for legisative reform.
Among his proposals are:

'A unicameral legislature, such
as Nebraska‘s, Villano would
simultaneously reduce the number
of legislators to 100-130, thereby
making the legislature "more ac-
countable to the public."

-A full time, year-round legis-
lature, “because the present body
can no longer consider 13,000
bills in only four or five month
" 'l‘his longer session, he
feels, would allow for much more

'areful consideration of legis-
lation.
Reduce the tiiimber of com

mittees, There are presently :ll
committees, and a Republican is
chiirman of each one. Villano

amu

claims that each chairman receives
a “lulu” of some $7,000 a year.
He feels that many of these com-
mittees are unnecessary. and cites
as an example the Committee on
National Defense and Military Af-
fairs.

-Trcat minority members
equally. Specifically, he asks that
they be given equal printing facili-
ties, comparable offices, and a
more equal chiince of serving as a
Committee Chairman. He adds
that "the Democrats mail is cen-
sored" and that “the Democrats
shouldn't hiivc even bothered
showing up to vote on the budget
- they didn‘t even know what was
going in."

Limit the governor to two
terms in office, and lower the
public office eligibility age to l8.

Right To Know

Villano believes that the secret
method in which the legislature
lins conducted its proceedings has
led to “great political abuses,"
and that this is the reason why “a
small hand of wealthy men how-
ruled New York State for the past
It years." He belieVes that ii is
not “merely enough to throw the
rascals out" bill that “it is iit‘t't'h'
sary for it to be made impossible
for abuses of power of this nature
to ever occur again." Consc-
(pienlly, he has drawn up a list of
reforms which are aimed primarily

at making the legislature “more

open." He proposes to:

-Mtindtite a public record of all

committee meetings.

Require a committee report on -
all bills recommended for passage.
-Permit electronic media and the
press to offer live coverage of all

committee proceedings.

~And a host of other proposals
that would close the loopholes
allowing abuses of power to oc-
cur, and rectify the present sit-
uation where "decisions are made

away from the public."

Legislature Maintains Bureaucracy

Villano claims that the legis-
lature “legislales just to maintain
the bureaucracy" itnd he points
out various t. of what he con-
siders to be legslators who til't!
interested in “helping them-
selves." As an example he men-
lions the formcr state industrial
commissioner who draws a
$28,000 a year pension "when
thousands of our senior citizens
are barely living above the level of
poverty" and the fact that it costs
some $4,580 to furnish only one
of the two room suites iii the new
Legislative ()ffici- ”

 
 

Building, a
total which President Nixon says
should he the guaranteed annual

Deal With the System

Villano bi-lichs that it is pos‘
silile to work “through the sys
tem," and he cites the passage of
the abortion rci'oriii law as one
example. llc cautions, lioweVer,
that “it is impossible to change

the system immediately " instead,
“the system must be dealt Willi,

I971 SUNYA Graduate Stephen Villano has announced his candi-

   

  

dacy for the Assembly. Villano, a “reform Democrat“ will stress
legislative reform during his campaign.

overnight," As further evidence of
success by working "within the
system," he cites the fact that five
reform committeemcn have been
elected in Albany. Villano firmly
believes that the reform wing of
the Democratic party must rim
candidates in every elect ion.
Villiino helieVes that the pro
“Mom of the last decade may
have failed because they did not
deal directly with the system.
“There was" he says, “massive
political action, bill this action
