Unduly criticized

Dear Editor:

In reference to the recent ASP
article on "Sex Bias at SUNYA".
it was stated therein that “if
judged by numbers only, the Plan
(the Al‘t'irmatiie Action Plait) can
he considered a partial failure."

It should he noted llial an At'~
t'iriiiatire Action Plan (lid not
exist during the time that com-
mitments for filling positions in
the Fall 1971 semester were being
made. The Fall 197] figures
should be considered a b: for
comparison with the coming
semesters when the Affirmative
Action Program will litiVe been in
operation long enough to begin
al't'eeting the recruitment and
selection proeess, The program
should not be eritieiZed for a
situation it had insufficient time
to influence.

Finally, attrition [through retire
ineiil aiitl term iion~renewal) and

 

   

the present budget situation are
factors which limit year-to-year
efforts at correcting an historic

imbalance.

Poor Taste?

Dear Editor:

Regarding the article “To My
Psychiatrist" and the captions
above it entitled “You Women are
all alike" in the ASP on Feb. 1: In
an article intended to confront
men with their misunderstanding
and misuse of women. the ASP
hits outdone itself. The drawing of
the nude and the comments writ-
ten on her in no way lend them-
seIVes to a general elevation of the
treatment of women by men.
Raising the cunsciriusnlss of men
demands a more restrained ap-
proach. The publication of this
material was done in poor taste.

Vietiiamimtion falters.

in Laos and in Cambodia our
“armies by proxy" are losing
ground. Most of Laos and Cam-
bodia are already lost and this will
expose South Vietnam more di-
rectly to attack from bases just
across the border. The war is not
winding down but expanding in
the air and Nixon will be under a
terrible temptation ~ with pres-
sure t'rom the Pentagon ~ to try
onee more for victory through
lt-veiini Northl Vietnam.

For ttioSe who are dying, the
Vietnam war is still very much an
issue. it is our job to make sure
that it remains tin issue with the
American public, which is paying
for the bombs.
