“amateur ideal
iost cannot exist

Alan D. Abbey
Sports Editor

With the suspension of Karl
Schranz, the Austrian skier, from
the Winter Olympics, Avery
Brundage has set afire, with the
Olympic flame, the
ever-smouldering ashes of the pro-
fessional versus amateur contro-
versy.

Schran‘l. is no doubt a scapegoat
an example set by Brundage in his
swan song as monarch of the
autocratic International Olympic
Committee it was a most unex-
pected move, as the day before
the suspension, no such action
was lielievrid to be forthcoming

Citing Schranv. as an exampli is
an eminently unfair move, for
there are many slot-rs who lttIVt‘
just as flagrantly defied the atria-
teur by~|aws of the Olympics. The
blatant hypocrisy of the ()lyiripics
is so evident, as Suva-t Nordic

There have been reports stating
that Schranz makes upwards of

pay-scales in all professiontil
sports. However, the suspension
of Seltranz only, heightens the
hypocrisy of the Games.

though. The Sovi:t Union has
subsidized everything, sports in-
cluded, and no one mentions the
word amateur in the same sen-
tence as the Soviet Hockey team.

The Olympics, especially the
Winter Games, cannot, and should
not continue along so hypocriti~
cally. The new head of the lOC,
whomever he shall be, will have
one big ques ion, with two solu-
tions, facing him when he assumes
office: Which way will the ()lym-
pres go'.‘ Will they allow
professionals to compete’.‘ or Will
the rules of amirteurisiu be rigidly
enforced, thus banning the top
Alpine, and Nordic skiers, and all
Eastern ‘Iurope athletes from the

"there are few...amateur

Mike Stein
Student

l think it's time we came to the realization that there are few, if
any amateur athletes left in International competition By the
time an athlete . reached international prominence, he has more
than likely received payments of one form or another for his
servrces Here in America, for example, we reward our athletes by
granting them athletic scholarships, under the guise of provrdrng
llii-iii wrllr an education In truth these "amateur athlete-stu-
i'iirely recech their degrees and are totally forgotten when

 

dcnts'
their four year eligibility expires
