COWRS Discusses
Sexism at SUNYA

by Mindy Altman

stliftsuesAdealing with women's rights are gaining momentum at Albany
be e. . mlong the reasons for this is the growing number of groups
coming involved and actively working for the women’s cause.

On this campus there is the Albany Chapter of the Caucus on
Women‘s Rights (COWRS) at SUNY. COWRS is divided into three
subgroups: faculty, staff. and students. Last Tuesday afternoon the
student group. led by graduate student in Romance Languages.
Michaela Cosgrove, held its ﬁrst meeting of the semester.

The ﬁrst item on the agenda was the question of what should he
done about sexist remarks made on campus. There is the possibility
that the student group might place an ad in the ASI’ asking that
anyone who bears or is subjected to such "sexist" remarks to report
them. However. the placement of an ad of this naturi- is still under
deliberation.

Also discussed was the possible investigation into the number of
fellowships for women graduate students, and the number of Women
graduate assistants that there are here, and also an invvstigation into
Food Service and its regulations regarding male and female employees
Another item brought to issue was the provision for women in health
serViCe, A study is being made of other schools which provide such
needs as a full time gynecologist and birth control. I

The possibility of the creation of a second field in Women's studies
was brought up. Such a program would be interdisciplinary and would
include such departments as English, History. Anthropology. and
Rhetoric and Public Address If anyone has any questions or
suggestions regarding possible courses. contact Junt- Hahnt-r. Depart

Dorm Authori
Severely Criti '

by Vicki Zeldiii
Capitol Correspondent
Second in a Series

The dorm room that you‘re
living in may have been designed
to fit around your closet.

This revelation tliJng with
charges of poor purchasing pro-
ccdures, illegal abandonment of
duties, excessive delays in con-
struction, and poor money man-
agement were leveled against the
State Dormitory Authority by the
Legislative Commission on Expen-
diture Review.

The Authority builds cafeterias
and dormitories for SUNY and
CUNY, Created in 1911, it has
constructed and equipped dorms
and provided beds for ovvr 63,000
students lit a cost of $406.3 mil-
lion. 'l'hc Authority has also con-
structed some 32,500 (lining hall
seats at a cost of over $105.7
million.

Purchasing and Specifications

The highly critical report charged
that the Authority did not take
advantage of quantity discounts
when buying supplies. They also
claimed that the Authority‘s spe-
cifications for certain articles were
so stringent that competitive price
bidding - which accounts for 52%
of the Authority's buying ~ was all
but impossible. However, at the
same time, these rigorous specifi»
cations were often applied un-
equally, A low bid on floor lamps
was rejected because the item
deviated in two ways from the
Authority‘s specifications. How-
ever, on the some day, the low
bidder on desks and chests was
awarded a contract chn though
thi- samples deviated in it) ways
from the Authority‘s specificit-
lions.

lilds on desks and chests were
only l‘t‘t‘t‘th'd from 2 out of 21
suppliers invited to respond. Some
were unable to ntt't'l. the Author
ily's specifications and others
were unable to have their samples
ready on time. Potential suppliers
were required to bid on both
desks and chests, and bids Were
not allowed for just desks or
chests. ()nc supplier stated, "We
feel that it would be in the inter"
last of all concerned that the Dor
milory Authority permit all the
manufacturers to bid on the
pieces that are their forte..."

Specifications for student wurd-

robes - closets - have remained
unchanged since 1950. These war-
drobes were developed and pur-
chased by the Authority and in-
stalled by contractors. Architects
must design rooms to accept these
wardrobes. The Authority claims
that they are inexpensive and re-
present a construction savings. Ar-
chitects interviewed by the Com-
mission often preferred built-in
wardrobes because they are more
in keeping with design and cost
less to maintain. Price estimates
found lhtlt built-in and pre-con-
structod wardrobes cost about the
same.

Wall hung toilet fixtures are
required in all dorms, However,
the Authority neither specifies or
checks to see if the supporting
walls are strong enough to hOld
them. As (I result, many toilets in
the three-year old Buffalo State
College dorms leak because of
wall flexing and damaged water
seals. A budget request by SUNY
for $57,750 to fix the walls is
pending.

Abandoning Duties

The Dormitory Authority was
originally responsible for the
maintenance and operation of the
dorms. However, through admini—
stratiVe changes, they have turned
this responsibility over to SUNY
which must in turn request funds
from the State. Last year’s appro-
priation was $24.9 million. The
State also subsidizes the Authori-
ty's debt serviCe. Last year $6.4
million of SUNY’s budget was
paid to the Authority for this
purpose. “if this subsidy were
unavailable it would require that
the standard rental for most
dormitories be increased from
$550 per person to about $740.
Thus, the State is presently sub-
sidizing each dormitory resident
at t] level of $100 per your," the
report concluded.

'l‘iixpaycrs are also picking up
dormitory phone bills. A strident
is charged .141an year for his room
phone and this money iii depo-
sin-d in the Authority‘s Income
Fund. This money is used to pay
off construction bonds, not lclcv
phone bills. The result is that, [110
entire telephone cost is piiid by
SUNY using State tax dollars.
Lust, your, there were 22,021)
phones in use that cost the tax
payers over $1.3 million. Albany's
bill for its 1,045 phones came to
$93,201.70.

Thel Legislative Commission on Expenditive Review has charged the State Dormitory Authority with
poor purchasing procedures, illegal abandonment of duties, excessive delays in construction, and poor
money management. The Commission also revealed that dorm rooms have been designed to fit around 

...ma
closets.

Cost Overruns and Time Delays

A Commission review of 30
dorm projects found that only
20% were completed when sche-
duled (and the scheduled comple-
tion date was ii revised one). A
third of the projects were 1 to 3
months lute, iind more than 6% of
the building was more than a year
late. These delays, aside from
causing inconveniences, hiked
construction prices.

Analysis of construction costs
for 13 dormitories completed
since July 1968 revealed that con-
struction costs for all 13 were
higher than initially budgeted.
Ten dorm projects run as much as
40% over their initial revised bud-
gets. 01 the three with the highest
budget overruns, one was conv
pleted on schedule while one was
9 months late and the other 5
months behind schedule,

Dormitory cosl had been about
$0,000 a bed, but recent. projects
havr- far exceeded this figure.
Dorm costs at SUC at Purchase
are $8,561 per bed, and at one
point, the cost per bed til the
Buffalo-Amherst. campus was
$10,165. Bclwvcri January 1967
and December 1070 the cost per
dorm bed hurl increased about
18% while, iiycrnge building costs
for the nation and New York City
increased only 112% and 20.5%
respectively.

The report went on to state, “If

Albany Examples

While the Commission's work
resulted in (In exhaustive study,
Very little data was collected from
this campus. Visits were made to
all of SUNY‘s universin centers
with the exception of Albany.
Inspectors also visited many of
the smaller State University Col-
lege centers across the state. Why
the bluc-cliip Commission which
included majority and minority
leaders of both paritcs chose not
to visit here is uncertain.

dorms are OPE"? but the tOwer is
still incomplete. Tisdale claimed
that the “tower will be finished
this semester and before the sum-
mer session."

'I‘isdale admitted that the lack of
students wishing to live in re-
sidence halls and the university’s
need for additional academic and
office space has prompted them
to consider using the residence
halls for other than residence pur-
poses. Tisdale stressed that this is
not a new concept since both
Pierce and Sayles Halls downtown
had originally been used as dorms,
were later converted to classes,
and most recently back to dorms
again.

The Expenditure Review report
claimed that "Direct State appro-
priations may also need to be
increased to cover costs of dormi-
torics and dining halls which may
be converted from their original
purpose -to serve another fund
tion."

While admitting that there were
over 2 million structural problems
at SUNYA, Tisdale stated that
there were “none that we haven't
been iible to skin the cut." He
claimed that the contractor was
bearing the cost for repairs.

Tisdtile ulso endeavored to lay
some rumors about Albany dormii
to rest. He said~ that “till the
towers are straight," even though
many students claim that they are
leaning. 'l‘lie tunnels that lead
from some of the quads to the
ucudemic podium have often been
rumored to be cracked and there-
fore closed to pedestrian triivel.
'l‘isdule cliiimed that there tunnels
were “never intended for people
to walk through...they are used
for utilities." He said that electri-
cnl, water and telephone lines run
through these tunnels and said,
“...it, is its hot as Hades down
