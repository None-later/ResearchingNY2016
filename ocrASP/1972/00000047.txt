TEHRAN, Iran AP - Thousands of Iranian villagers
were unaccounted for Thursday after a week-long
blizzard that dumped 10 to 26 feet of snow in
outlying areas after four years of drought.

Newspapers put the ﬁgure of missing persons at
6,000. Among them is a U.S. female college student
and two male companions who went mountain
climbing near Tehran on Monday.

SAIGON AP - U.S. and South Vietnamese war-
planes took to the air in large numbers Thursday in
intense raids to counter increased enemy attacks in
the central and northern provinces.

Military spokesmen said U.S. Navy and Air Force
jet ﬁghter bombers flew 85 strikes in South Viet-
nam, compared to a daily aVerage of less than 10 in
the past four months

Some observers felt, the aircraft moves demon-
strated Nixon‘s lack of confidence in the Viet-
namese ability to protect departing US. soldiers,
although the administration has consistently claim-
ed that Vietnamization is successful.

The show of aerial strength also raises the possi»
bility of massive retaliation against North Vietnam
should Hanoi launch an all-out offensive.

Notional

WASHINGTON AP President Nixon said
Thursday “there will be no further concessions on
our part" at the Vietnam peace talks unless Ilanoi,
in his view, agrees to negotiate seriously.

This was but one item in a il5~minute unannoun-
ced-in-advance news conference that Nixon began
by saying he will leave Washington for Communist
Chinainext 'I‘hursday.

Talking without interruption for about 15 minutes
at the outset, Nixon said his meetings with Chinese
leaders would represent. more of a dialogue than
negotiations because “we are in truth at a begin-
ning.“

Nixon was asked if he felt it was fair to the voters
and rival would-be presidential candidates to expect
no presentation of alternatives to the ciglitxpoint
Vietnam peace proposal he unVcilcd before a nation
wide television audience Jan. 25.

Nixon responded: “All have a riglil to say what
they want, They must dccidc if II is right. lo say it."

State

NEW YORK AP - A grolip identifying itself as
South Vietnamese students scich the offices of the
South Vietnamese consul general on 'l‘hursday.

'l‘hey demanded llic resignation of President Ngu
yen Van 'l‘hicu, release of “over 100,000 political
prisoners," and "the immediate dismcmbcrinciit of
Thicu ‘s police force and reprt-ssch apparatus."

When unil'ormcd city policemen arrived at the
consulate they were given a statement through the
(loor's letter slolj.

“Please don't interfere, the statement read. “We
are simply occupying a piece of our own property
a property which has been acquired at the cost of
countless Vietnamese lives - to make known the
magnitude of the crimes being ~committed by the
U.S. govornment against our people."

NEW YORK AP - A suit described by the state
attorney gcneral‘s office as unprecedented in the

panel of 60 people from which
the 12 jurors would be chosen;
one was Puerto Riean, six were
black and 53 were white.

George Wilson, a retired army
captain was the government prose-
cutor. l-lc challenged the four
black women on the panel and a
young white man with a beard
and longish hair was taken off
loo. l’iiially they threw off the
only l’ucrto Rican juror_ “If he
doesn‘t understand English," said
.ludgc Melxncr. “he can't sit ton
the jury).” So the jury was select-
ed all wliitc and all middle class.

Yoruba never denied the two
counts against him: refusal to
report for a medical examination
and refusal to report for induc-
tion, “I knew l was brcaking the
law," Yoruba answered when
questioned by Wilson. “I was
breaking the law of the U.S. ruling
cl' not of the American people.
A rule made by a group of ruling
families of the US. I was going
against the will of the ltockcl'cl~
