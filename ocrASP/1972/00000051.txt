Films You May Never See

Out of the despair at not having our hunger for films from Cinema's
Golden Age satiated. there has arisen a very exciting venture in the
form of a new film group on campus to be known as“Cinematheque
SUNYA".

Making ‘ts debut this Tuesday aigh'. at 7:30 pm. in LC 4, the
“C‘ncmateque” will fc1tu-e some of the great stars of the past ’n some
of their lenser kn-"wn but. definitc'y not less inspired films.

Our own Arthur Lciinig of tb~- Art Department 'ias been working
with noted tilm historian Will‘am K. Everso'i in securing some rather
rare prints. Neil Cohen and lohn Brandeau are ‘he co ordinato's of
this enterpris.». 'l‘hc tentach echedulc "'Iclur'es.

FEBRUARY 11, 1972

 

BY I‘de Palley

There has always been a notion in the world of classical music that
conductor who is a personal friend of it composer must, naturally, hi
the prime authority concerning performances of that Composer's
music. This seems to he such a natural thing that it is invariably taken
for granted. I intend to dispute that notion with regards to Bruno
Walter and Gustav Mahler.

Gustav Mahler was one of the last great neurotic composers, a man
whose problems, according to Harold Schoenberg of the New Yuri:
Times make ’I‘chaikowsky's problems palc by comparison. His music is
strange and powerful, yet often tender and familiar. His themes are
grandiose, indeed, often pompous, but they are heart-rendering
nevertheless. And his powers of orchestration are astounding -- there is
nothing in that respect which he cannot do.

Mahler‘s friendship with the young Bruno Walter began in 1894 in
Hamburg, following a performance of Mahler's Symphony No. I ( Iiic
Titan). ’[‘his friendship lasted until Mahler's death in Itll l,aftcr which
Walter gook a lonely position as almost the sole conductor of Mahler's
work. That Walter knew more about Mahler’s compositions than
anyone else is certain. That his recordings of Mahler's symphonies are
the most definitivu is probably true. And, that, when Bruno Walter
died in 1962, we lost the last link to that mystical figure from the
past, is a pity. However , I find at least three other recordings of
Mahler‘s First Symphone superior in the broad terms of listening
pleasure and over-all unity. 'l‘hcse recordings, by Bernstein, Solti, and
Horenstcin, are each different in their own way, yet are find
renditions of a great work. ’l‘rue, they might not be exactly what
Mahler had in mind (only Walter knew that ), but where would be
today if there were people around who stillrcmcmberedBcethoven?
The concepts of tempi aan relative dynamics are, as clarinctist Don
Weinberg related to me, simply table talk. Interpretation is an
individual concern.

Leonard Bernstein's recordings of the nine Mahler symphonies hiiVe,
since they appeared, became the “old standbys," challenging the
Walter recordings for oVer-aII integrity. It is the Bernstein recording of
the First Symphone, though, where the big changes are Bernstein's
version flows-rises and UllIJS” with every bar. The finali- is almost a
new work altogether. Herc, Bernstein's exaggerated accelerandos and
ritardandos add immense depth to an already vast work. One can feel
the heart sway with the New York Philharmonic as they follow
Bernstein's unusual instructions to the letter, save some relativer
obscure miscues in thc brasscs- ll tough thing to aviod in a piece with
seven different. horn parts, four trumpls, three tromlioncs, and a tuba!
Perhaps Bernstein's oVercmotional approach is loo much, but it. is
worth the trouble getting used to it.

Jascha I‘Iorenstein's old recording of the Mahler FITS, was for long
the favorite of Records 1!! Recon His new recording with the
London Symphony is outstanding 'l‘hoiigli his tempo changes are not
as dramatic as Bernstein 's, they are able to convey, through subtlety, I
guess, equal amounts of emotional fervor dust .is important is the
over-all quality of the pressing. 'I'Iie soiiics ol' the Bernstein recording
represent t'olumbia at. their finest IIoWeVer, llie IIoreiisti-in on
Nonesuch, a find budget label, has fine sound. fine enough to please
the most demanding listener And the list price is $2.1m as compared
to Columbia's $5.98. To those of you who woriiler how a three dollar
disc can compare to a six dollar disc, I extend my sympathy arid the
understanding that the classical record market is a strange thing,
indeed.

ALBAN Y STUDENII' PRESS

Wednes

The newly reconstituted Flying
Burrito Brothers gave two shown
of surprisingly delightful music in
the Ballroom Wednesday night.
Led by singer-songwriter Rick Ro-
berts and propelled by the vir-
tuosity of electric ﬁddler Byron
Berllne and steel pedal guitarist
Don Beck, the Burritos produced
a warm, full flow of country-rock,
nicely spiced by occasional foray:
into purtI bluegrass music (another
genre at which they excel).

For once the Concert Board
lucked out - they had booked the
Burritos before they discovered
that the band coming to Albany
bore little resemblance in per-
sonnel to any previous version of
the Flying Burrito Bros, As Don
Beck, the newest Burrito, noted,
the Burritos were always a fairly
fluid ensemble, and several per-
sonnel changes had already occur-
red in the band‘s history before
founded Chris Hillman quit in
December (to put an act together
with Steve Stills) and left Rick
Roberts, himself a replacement
for the previously departed Chris
Ethridgc, with rights to the name
and the option of putting ii new
band together.

Rick (lid, and the newest version
of the Flying Burrito Bros. proved
Wednesday night to be by far the
best. 0n material taken from the
