Danes Clip Hamilton; Set For Rival

by Kenneth Arduino

Albany State won their seven-
teenth straight home game in
beating a young Hamilton team
by the score of 83 to 70. The 83
points scored by Albany was the
Danes‘ season high topping the 82

oints Alban scored a inst
Plattsburgh. y Ba

the Danes coming off their big
victory last Saturday against Buf-
falo State looked flat for most of
the contest. The young Hamilton
team started four freshmen, in-
cluding a 6‘10" center, and a
sophomore

Led by Mark Badger and Herb
Ogden, Hamilton rattled off a
16-10 lead, with only Bob Rossi
hitting with some consistency for
the Danes. Coach Sauers decided
to go his bench and he found the
right combination in Smith, Wel-
chone and Curtis. Reggie Smith
had 7 quick points, Dave Wel-
chons had 6 and Bob Curtis had 5
points to lead an Albany spurt of
17«10 giving Albany the lead.

Albany and Hamilton traded
points until the half ended with
Albany leading 38-36. In the first
half, Albany was hindered by the
poor shooting of Byron Miller and

  

“I:
or-

John Quattrochi who only had
one basket between them. Ham-
ilton was kept in the game by
5’9” Mile Badger who had 19
points and shot an incredible 8 for
11 from the floor.

As the second half opened Al-
bany came out with a big 16 to 3
tear with Quattrochi (8 points)
and Reggie Smith (6 points) lead-
ing the charge. The drive was
helped by many mistakes made by
Hamilton including three con-
secutive turnovers and many per-
sonal fouls.

After only three minutes Ham-
ilton's Herb Ogden fouled out and
their center John Adams was in
danger of doing likewise. Albany
then got sloppy and Hamilton
went on a 10 to 4 spree, before
Adams fouled out. Hamilton Io-
ing its height advantage and its
top shooter having cooled off
could not catch the Danes who
were being led by Quattrocchi.

Even when Albany started to
clear its bench, it was able to
maintain its lead. Albany’s high
scorer was John Quattrocchi with
19, Bob Rossi scored 17 and
Reggie Smith totaled 14. Bob
Curtis, Werner Kolln and Byron
Miller did a fine job on the boards
against the taller visitors. For
Hamilton Mark Badger had 28
points and Ernie Found, shooting
a remarkable 15 for 17 from the
foul line had 23 points. The Danes
are not 13-4 and play arch rival
Siena this Saturday.

 

Tomorrow night the Albany
Great Danes take on one of their
most hated rivals, Sieiia College
This series started in 1939 with
Siena holding a slim 14-13 lead.
However, under Doc Sauers the
Danes are 13-9.

The Indians got off to their best
start in nearly two decades as [hey
won their first five games. By
mid-January, they were 9-3 but
they were then hit with a rash of
injuries and lost five olit of their
last six games. However, Fred
Shear, who has been out for the
last few games, is expected to play
against Albany.

The game tomorrow should pro~
vide a great deal of action on and
off the court. Last year a few
members of the Potter Club had a
fight with members of the Sicna
student body. The Albany J.V.
meets Siena's J.V. prior to the big
game starting at 6:30. No tickets
are being sold to the public. A
large crowd is expected so you
better come early.

Championships.

This year will be the Dane
Swimmers‘ first time in the meet,
as they are only in their third year
as a varsity sport. Oswego should
be one of the toughest contests of
the year, although when ii team is
1-iI. it must seem as if they are all
tough.

The standouts. and surpiscs for
the Danes so far this year have
been sophomore diver Zack
Wilson, Peter Gerstenhaber, and
Len Van Ryn. Last week against
Cortland, even though the Danes
Were drubbed, 6744], Wilson won
two diving events. One of the
biggest. problcms for the Danes
has been the fact that they are
very young, and consequently
they are inexperienced. It has
been shown over and over again
that experience is as necessary as
talent in sport, and it is in this
area that the Danes should be
most improved next season.

The home season will be conclu-
ded four days from Saturday
