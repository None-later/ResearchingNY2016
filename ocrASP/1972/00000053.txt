Although its affair with the
media is waning, venereal disease
continues to maintaini its popular-
ity with the public. Long after the
Time and Newsweek reviews have
yellowed with age, VD will live on
in the hearts and bodies of mil-
lions. No newcomer to the stage,
VD in at least one of its forms has
been around since biblical times,
As all things come to an end, so,

we can unmask fallacies and fears,
making way for the day when VD
will be nothing but a has-been.

In all seriousness, venereal di-
sease is a real problem. Left uri-
treated, the consequences can be
disastrous. Untreated syphilis can
result in insanity, bone deformi-
ties, heart disease and deformed
babies. Gonorrhea, its less serious
but far more prevalent cousin, can
lead to arthritis, sterility, pelvic
inflammation and blind babies. ll~

SUNYA can and does diagnose
and treat cases of venereal disease.
So, too, do clinics such as the
Washington Park Free Clinic (for-
merly Refer Free Clinic). Admini'
strators of both organizations
have stressed the importance of
early diagnosis and complete
treatment, discouraging self-
treatment. Their basic procedures
are the same: dealing with the
history of the case, lab tests and
physical examinations. If the out
come of any of these invest-iga»
tions suggest the possibility of
VD, treatment will be given.

There is no blood test for gono—
rrhea. Male gonorrhea is diagnosed
by examining a smear of the
discharge under a microscope.
Positive diagnosis of a female
gonorrhea is more difficult; a cul-
ture of material from the cervix
must be taken.

Syphilis occurs in three stages. A
small, painless sore appears on the
genitals, anus or mouth ten to
ninety days after sexual relations.
It will disappear without treat-

 

of the spirochete. in the second-
ary stage, a blood sumtle and a
serologic test for syphilis (STS)
will aid in diagnosis. In the case of
latent syphilis, a spinal fl Jid test is
performed to determine whether
the nervous syslem ha been in-
feeted.

Preventive Measures

At present, there is no vaccine
for syphilis or gonorrhea How-

be taken to reduce the cliincrs of

Students Cop-Out
On Educational Loans

((IPSJ - On cvr-ry major campus
in the country there are students
who are going to school with the
federal government footing thi-
bill. in most cases, though, these
students havr obtained loans, not
scholarships, and are therefore
obligated to pay back the money.

But now the federal government
is worrying about these loans.
From January .‘ll to September
30 there was a three-fold incrciise
in the number of defaulted loans.
The actual mother of defaulted
loans jumped from 3,040 to
8,963.

“Up to One's Conscience"

Any health service, doctor, or
clinic must follow certain dirce
tives from the County Health Ad-
ministration, and Federal and
State Authorities. Although in-
stances must be reported. the only
concern for those who treat VD it»
to cure it. A patient is asked to
give the names of those 'with.
whom he or she has had intimate
contact. so that those person
might also be treated, if he so
desires, the patient can inform
those people himself. if not, lllt'

A major emphasis was put on
the necessity for voter registration

and no tuition at state schools,
there was some disscntion over
the third point-that of no public
