Student Patrol Will

Aid Crime Fight

by Bob lent

The establishment of a new stu-
dent security patrol has recently
been announced through the joint
efforts of the Office of Residence
and the Security Office. The pro-
gram, intended to “assist the uni-
versity security force and to re-
duce crime in residence areas",
will officially begin about March
1

“The need for a student patrol
was realized after the increase last
fall in crime on campus—armed
robberies, vandalism of vending
machines, and rip-offs in the resi-
dence halls," said Dr. Charles G.
Fisher, Director of Residences.
“Another, perhaps not so obvious
reason for the student patrol," he
added, “is to improve community
relations; to bridge the gap that i
feel exists between students and
the security force.”

The student security patrolmen
will be organized into five teams
of two students each, and will
patrol each of the ﬁve quadrangles
six hours a night, seven nights a
week. They will be armed only
with a two-way radio, possibly a
ﬂashlight and some form of iden-
tification.

"The students," said Dr. Fisher,
"are not expected to apprehend
any suspects-just to notify secur-
ity." A large part of the student
patrolman's job will consist of
responding to accident calls,
checking the tunnels, and noti-
fying students who have left the
door to their rooms open. It is the
hope of Jim Williams, Director of
Security, that, with the inception

of the student patrol,“security
will be able to respond to any cll1

for help on campus within twc
minutes".

Although the program is in-
tended to release full-time secur
ity guards to deal with crime on
campus, according to Dr. Fisher,
“the student patrol is emphati'
cally not intended to be an ‘un-
dercover’ patrol for security. We
realize that any drug busts would
destroy the faith that students
might have in the program." And
so this area is clearly out of the
student patrolman’s jurisdiction.

Student security patrolmen will
be paid $2.00 an hour and super-
vised by a full-time security of-
ficer. in addition, student patrol
coordinators will be designated.
(Three have already been hired.)
They will have the responsibility
of scheduling patrol tours for the
other students within the pro-
grain.

The student patrol is a pilot
program and is funded only
through the present academic
year. An evaluation of it will be
made once it gets underway in
order to determine its effective-
ness. “if it doesn‘t work out,"
said Dr. Fisher,“it‘ll end,"

“We would hope," he added,“
"thatthe student community could
accept the program at face value
and without any preconceived
bias. We hope that students will
cooperate with the student patrol
and give it a chance to work."

Any further information re-
garding the student security patrol
may be obtaincd from either the
office of Residences (457-8836)
or the Security Office (457-7770).

Special from SWE FIRE

This Wednesday, a speaker re<
presenting the U.S. Army coun-
ter-insurgency program will speak
in the Assembly Hall.

In the face of defeat fighting
conventional wars against third
world populations, the U.S. govA
crnmcnt, in the past few years,
has been relying more and more
on systematic political repression
and thinly veiled attempts at gun-
ocide and torture.

The two most graphic examples
of U.S. "counter-insurgency"
methods are Operation Phoenix in
Vietnam and the case of Dan
Mitrionc in Uruguay.

Ofﬁcial reports state that Opera-
tion Phoenix is designed to “des-

troy the Viet Cong infrastruc-
ture". in fact, Phoenix, as de-
signed, lias killed some 20,000
(low estimate) civilians in South
Vietnam. Agents of the army and
CIA typically raid the areas of
South Vietnam which give strong
support to the Viet Cong. They
torture individuals for infor-
mation and destroy whole villages
as "examples" for other recalci-
trant civilians.

We would never have heard of
Dan Mitrione if he had not been
kidnapped and executed by the
’l‘upemaros in Uruguay. Mitrione
was attached to AlD (Agency for
International Development), a
cm front group. His job in Uru~

Enrollment Grows

As Funds Shrink

by Vicki chdiii
Capitol Correspondent
Third and last in ii series

Construction cutbacks at Albany Statc will not only affect this
school's physical sli'llclurc, but will also illlt'l‘ its cnrollmcnt goals and
probably cliangi- acadcmic schi-duling.

'l‘hc coiislruclion cutbacks, announced by SUNY Ccniral, include
the suspcnsion of planning of a $7.1 million hcallh and physical
cducalion building, $6.0 million coiifcrcnci' ccntci', work on the
library bascnicnl valued at $505,000, $210,000 for work on tcm-
porury parking lol sili's, and many olhci' cuts. In all, some 20 projects
licrc wcrc liil.

Last ycar Albany was [old to just about forch plans fora ficld
house, a wcsl podium cxlcnsion and iiiui‘rii-d studcnl housing. 'l‘hc
Slali- Univcrsily (‘onstruction l“llll(l had already spent some $000,000
for planning of lhc podium cxli-nsion, that would h:ch included
classrooms and officcs.

Oiic hundrcd and l'ifly construction projccts throughout lhc SUNY
systcm wcrc suspcndcil, plans to cut costs on projccls already
undcrway and suspending planning on other projccts in the system are
estimated to savc somc $267 million. Of all the SUNY campuses,
Albany suffcrcd lhc most as a result of the construction cuts.

Accompanying this building cutback will, of necessity bc, a
l‘t't'Villllillllill of enrollment figures as well as attcmpts to find
altr-rnativc inclbods to cducalc as many people as possiblc in existing
spuci’.

SUNY Chancellor Erin-s1 Boycr has pointed to thc fact that high
schools arc currently graduating their largcsl cl;~ s, ycl SUNY will
not bc able to accomniodalc lhcm. Originally lhc ystcm had liopcd
to have plilL‘cs for somc 11,000 ncw students, bul lbcy arc now
planning on only living ablc lo lakc in about. 11,600 studcnls. (iovurnor
ltockcl‘cllcr's SUNY budch rccommi-ndiilion calls for Albany to
incri-asc its undergraduate cnrollmcnt by only 100 sludcnts.

Al Albany, Vicc Prcsidciil for Univcristy Affairs, Lcwis Wi-lcli statcd
that construction has iicvcr kcpl piicc with cnrollnicnt growth. lll‘
cited thc fact that Albany is a campus hiiilt to accommodatc sonic
10,000 studcnls but it, currently has an enrollment in cxccss of
11,000. lll' full that thc growth pillll'l'll has slowcd hcrc, Wclch
disc sscd alti-rnalivc means of coping with whatever new growth is
dccidcd for Albany. While he (lid point out that lhc construction
projects had bccn suspi-ndcd and not killcd, lic did admit that thori-
was "no grciil optimism" that thc culs would bc restored soon. A
morc intensc use of llll' downtown facility was sllggcsli-(l as a possible
way to pcrmil growth.

   
 

      

 

Sincc thcri- arc no provisions for more faculty—mutually the
(Ilianccllor produccd figurcs showing a loss of (57 teachers across lhc
stati- for next years cnrollmcnl may be protcctcd by increasing
faculty workload according to SUNY Chanci-llor Boyer. Hc also stated
that futurc cnrollmciit growth will bc accommodated by a bcttcr
utilization of existing spiict'. Extension of thc length of the traditional
class day is onc of lhc proposcd ways of improving utilisation of
