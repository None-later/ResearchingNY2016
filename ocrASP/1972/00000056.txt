  

Deon Scughi for
3-year College

With the new experimental time-shortened baccalaureate degree
program to be launched at SUNYA next fall, a Search Committee
began work this week on the task of identifying candidates for the
crucial administrative position of dean. Nominations for appointment
to this post may be submitted to any of the faculty, administrative, of
student members of the Search Committee (listed below.)

Funded by an initial grant of $100,000 from the Carnegie
Corporation, the SUNYA program will be inaugurated with an
enrollment of fifty selected high school students who have completed
the eleventh grade. Enrollment is expected to increase to 200 in 1973,
with an eventual ceiling of 1600 by 1976. According to Dr. Philip
Sirotkin, Vice President for Academic Affairs, the program, even at
this preparatory stage, has generated great interest in high schools and
colleges both in the local area and across the nation.

Because of budget and staffing problem, recruitment for the
Deanship will give priority to candidates from the Albany campus.
Eligibility extends to faculty and administrators, with the following
qualifications and requirements for the job high on the list:
Candidates should hold a Ph.D. and have some teaching experience on
thehcollege level. Administrative experience in a univeristy or college
setting is desirable. In addition to administering the new B.A.
program, the new dean will have to work closely with the academic
deans and department heads of the university center; but the program
itself—which will be located on the downtown Albany campus‘will
be independent and interdisciplinary. An important part of the Dean’s
task will be the generation of outside funding beyond the initial “seed
money" grant from the Carnegie Corporation. However, the nature of
the new program gives ground for considerable optimism in this
respect.

Self-nominations, preferably with supporting evidence, such as vitas
are welcome, as are nominations from students, faculty, and admini:
strative personnel. Because of the shortness of time, nominations
should be submitted as quickly as possible so that interviews may be
arranged. Names and addresses of Search committee members to
whom nominations should be submitted are as follows: Melvin
Bers, Economics, $8368; Vernon Buck, Educational Opportunities
Program, ULB 94; Tanya Clyman, Slavic Studies, HU 246; Nathaniel
Friedman, Mathematics, ES 114; Peter Furst, Anthropology SS 367'
Randolph Gradner, Education, ED 212; Katherine Heinig, Eiological
Sciences, Bl 216; Debbie Natansohn, student, c/o ASP- Malcolm
Smiley, Division of Science and Mathematics, CHB 27‘ Lewis Wclch

Outstanding Prof Awards
Stress Teaching Ability

Nominations for the Outstand-

cepted from faculty and adminis-
tration until February 15th, and
for students the dealine is Febru-
ary 17th. Nominations should be
sent to the Committee Chairman,
Professor Terrell Bynum in HU
256.

According to Bynum, students
have recently been placing more
emphasis on a professor‘s teaching
rather than on his publishing rc-
cord, and the purpose of the
Outstanding Teacher Awards is to
recognize which professors have,

President Oversteps Bounds?

Checks and Balances at Stake

Yes:

OPINION
Steve Gerber
Member, Central Council

Last spring the students here at
SUNYA ratified a new Consti-
tution for Student Association in
ii unchrsity-widc referendum,
This Constitution called for a
separation of powers between the
Executch and the Central Coun-
cil, the legislative branch of S.A.
It was over a question of interpre-
tation of the separation of powers
that a conflict arose between the
President of S.A., Michael Lam-
pcrt, and the Central Council.

On February 2nd, Mr. Lampcrt
vetoed a bill called Central Coun-
cil Budget Procedures. This bill
provided for a Central Council
Budget Committee to make rc-
commendations to the Council on
the Executive budget proposal for
next year. This Budgct Procudurcs
bill was an assuriincc that Central
Council would have an adi-quutc
timi- pcriod to carefully rcvicw
tlic ixoposcd liudgct for the t'lilll‘l'

Beneath a surface of techni-
calities of questionable import lay
a struggle by the Council to re-
assert its duly constituted powers
of final audit and control of stu-
dent finances. The Central Coun-
cil is the most representative body
of student opinion in Student
Association. The Council has to
pass a budget for 1972-73 acn»
dcmic year before the rind of this
semester. Without thc cnactmcnt
of thv Budget Procedures bill, the
Council would have had only
three weeks to discuss, review,
and come to a final decision on a
budget which takes the Executive
nearly 21/1 months to prepare. It
would have been nearly impos-
sible for the Council to accurately
review the entire budget in only
three weeks. Thus the need for a
Central Council Budget Com-
mittee to review the budget pro-
posal—as its various parts arc as»
scmblcd—is evident.

in his vcto message to the Con-
tral Council, Mr. Lampcrl did not

actions , and Council's actions this
your, leave little doubt as to where
this control rcsts. For you to state
that this was at issuc is, I believe,
a gross mistauimcnt of facts.

Council (to the students it repre-
sents) to exercise its power of
final control of student finances.
Rather he attacked the technical
errors in the wording of the bill.
The President felt that the bill was
in violation of a goal of cooper-
ation between the Executive and
the Council. However, without
the passage of this bill, the Exc-
cutivs would have afforde such
little time for the Council to
review the budget proposal that in
effect the Council would have
been forced to rubber-stamp the
President‘s recommendations. Mr.
Lampert also alleged that the im-
plcmciitation of the bill would be
a duplication of efforts and a
waste of time. I assert that dupli—
cation is often necessary in a
system of checks and balances
between the Executch and the
Council, He also said that it is
difficult to gain an appreciation of
the groups and clubs that mzikc up
S.A. It was the feeling of the
Council that the students them-
selves, whom the Council rcprc-

sents, are the essence of a relevant
student government.

It was on these technical
grounds that the President pre-
sented his rationale for the veto.
However, a majority of Council
felt that the principle of separ-
ation of powers, as well as the
execution of Council‘s obligations
to the students, were more im-
portant than Mr, Lampcrt’s tech-
nical objections. Since there was 5'
time limitation, the Council de-
cided to override the veto and
then pass the necessary amend-
ments to correct the faulty
wording. Technicalities should be
a means for protecting a principle,
not a means for ignoring a system
of checks and balances.

Therefore, in what spirit was the
veto employed? Instead of that
drastic measure, the President
could have tried to amend the bill.
Mr. Lampert inaccurately inter-
preted the intent of the bill be

The Central Council was not
playing games with the Executive.
Rather the Council was exercising
the duty it has to the students it
represents to carefully review and
allocate a budget for all the mem-
bers of Student Association. It
was pressing question of time— if
the veto were upheld, a new bill
would have had to have had to
have been submitted, taking up
time when the Central Council
Budget Committee should have
been organized. The Central
Council has the duty to pass a
budget for the entire Student As-
sociation; for the Council to pass
a proposal to which it could only
give a cursory glance would have
been a dereliction of our obliga-
tions to our fellow students. The
issue at stake was the principle of
checks and balances between the
President and the Council. It was
Council's moral obligation to the
students to maintain and preserve

cause he was not present at the that principle, and it was in that
