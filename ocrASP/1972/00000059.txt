Hardy maimen take close

by Ira Mozille

Encouragement and determina-
tion filled the air at Union College
Saturday as Coach Garcia's hardy
grapplers took a 4-3-1 record into
ii triangular match against Union
(4-8) and a visiting Amherst Col-
lege of Massachusetts (3-6).

Edged on by the loud support of
a few Albany fans and the force-
ful coaching of Garcia, the mat-
men captured ii close second place
with it total of forty-eight points.
A good comeback enabled Union
to place first with only one more
point than the Dunes, and Am-
herst finished a distant third with
thirty-two.

In the 118 weight class, Tom
Hall beat Crease of Amherst. in a
1:09 fall, and Heron of Union in
:67. The 126 class featured Rex
Carey as a double winner also; in a
3:16 fall, he beat Miota of Am-
herst and in a 11‘] score, he
overpowered Calabro of Union.
Larry Frederick outdid Bulaban of
Amherst in 5-1.

Freshman Larry Mims joined the
list of double winners when he
won the 142 weight class over
Blair of Amherst in 3:20 and
D‘Agostino of Union with ii 9-3.
Wrestling at. 150 was Jeff Albrecht
who won a forfeit from Amherst
and beat White.uf Union with a
5-2 decision. Larry Mims' older
brother Phil with a bad knee
outclassed Sehcll of Amherst in
the 158 weight class with a deer
sion of ll-3, and in a fall of ~i :20,
he beitt lsgro of Union.

Amherst added to their scori- by
wrestling admirable in the last

weight classes. They beat. Albany
in the l6'l, I77, l90, and heavy
spots. However, the Great Ditties
maintained their usual attitude by
overtaking Union in three classes.
Tom Horn was declared winner
over Gurney in the 167 spot 5-4;
Doug Batter iii I77 bi-at Simsoii
III-2, and AI Mercer at. liiii pinned
Wartlcll in a fall til it: it).

NCAA realignment plan

dards for membership in these

 

A plan designed to equalize

competition among Colleges and
Universities in the NCAA has bten
proposed by P. if. Theibert of
Hofstra University, and will be
sent. to all member schools today.

The plan leaves the choice of
to the individual

divisions. The divisions would be:
open, university, college, and
closed. The “open” division
would be set up for large instituv
tions with big athletic depart-
ments. The “closed” category
would be the province of any size
universities which offer no grant-
-in-aid money whatsoever.

Albany would fit into the closad
category for the simple fact that
no athletic scholarships are
handed out. The set-up would also
provide for parity between institu-
tions of this division by making
sure no recruiting at all takes
place. Of course, schools would
maintain their traditional images,
such as Cortland and Brockport,
as jock schools. Even though they
do not give grants-in-itid, year
after yetir they turn out. good
teams. Prospectch athletes would
still go to those schools, but the
Hofstra plan would be a big step
towards equality.

Schools could also have differ-
ent teams in different divisions. A
school with a good basketball
team need not be kept brick be-
cause ol' the ineptness of their
football team. Albany would
probably keep all its teams the
closed division, because no scho-
larships are offered, and the tennis
would get iii over their head if
they tried to compete against
teams that recruit.

'l‘hi- Ilofstrtt plan set-ms to be a
good one, if only because it i-Iini-

OPEN DIVISION-Jo include
any Institution which so
chooses to use student athletes
to attempt to win a national
championship. The primary
plan Is institutional autonomy
in that each institution controls
its own destiny within the con-
itnes of attempting to win a
championship with under-
graduate students who are
seeking a degree. UNIVERSITY
DIVISION-~Grant-in-ala guide-
lines Include the number of
participants on a playing learn.
times the official costs in the
university bulletin. For axe
ample, football would be 22
times the bulletin cast. Basket
ball would be live times the
bulletin cost. This guideline
could be altered to suit what
best titted that group at univer-
sllles which could not aliord
open policies. Institutions In
this group would have more
than 3.000 male under-
graduates.

COLLEGE DIVISION--The
same rules as above subject to
modification by this group for
Institutions under 3,000 stu-
dents.

CLOSED CATEGORV—~This
category Is for Institutions oi
any size who olier no granI-in-
aid money, and who do not
permit any siaii members to
recruit. The guidelines would
intentionain be very severe and
would emphasize that no coach
could leave the campus for the
purpose at recruiting. No
special lurid from the Insti-
tution or alumni would be ai-
Iolted to recruiting. Hopelully,
all coaches would be lull-time
tactilly and stall members who
trad lull lime tops on campus or
in the community which did
not include coaching duties.
they woutd be paid extra, lot
their coaching duties, the same
as high school coaches are in
more areas today.
