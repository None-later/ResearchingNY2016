Ecuador's military chiefs ousted President Jose Maria
Velasco lbarra Tuesday night for the fourth time in his career
and sent him off to Panama. The purpose of the coup
apparently was to prevent the election of a radical to the
presidency.

Brig. Guillermo Rodriguez Lara, who was rewarded with
command of the army after putting down an attempt to
overthrow Velasco last April, declared himself president. He
said he would be assisted by a council made up of the three
service chiefs: Rear Adm. Renaldo Vallejo, Air ForCe Gen.
Julio Espinosa Pineda and whoeVer is named to commilnd the
army.

The new president pledgerl to respect all existing interna-
tional treaties but announced no other plans or policies,

A Democratic iliist'lnblynlilll wants New York State to
legalize, regulate and tax the sale of marijuana llll' way it does
alcohol.

Assemblyman Franz Lelchlcr of Manhattan told ii news
conference Tuesday he is reintroducing a bill which faich to
pass last year bill now bears some modifications.

The basis intent of the bill, however, is the same: to remove
the legill ban on possessing, selling and using marijuana.

lieichter said he is behind the drive "because of strong
medical evidence and opinion" that marijuana is no more
harmful than alcohol or tobacco,

The current widespread use of the illegal plunt, he ﬂuid, "is
similar to the situation during Prohibition" when 8l|l('tl of
liquor were illegal.

Nixon Leaves for China

By Gaylord Shaw
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON AP - President
Nixon began his “journey for
peace" to China Thursday - a
historic mission he said he was
undertaking for all mankind in
search of a common ground with
the long-hostile and isolated
Asian Communist power.

As he embarked for the first
face-tu-facc summit meeting ever
between U.S. and Chinese Com-
munist leaders, he tempered his
words of hope with words of
caution.

"We are...undcr no illusion that
20 years of lmstility...wi|l be
swept away by one week of
talks," Nixon told some 8,000
persons attending farewell cere-
monies at the White House. Then
he and Mrs. Nixon winged west-
ward to Hawaii on the first leg of
his 20,395-milc, 13-day journey.

“We will have great differences
in the future," be said. “What we
must do is find a way to see that
we can have our differences willi-
out being enemies iit war."

iii-forl- returning to the United
States Feb. 28, he will have an
open~cnrlerl series of talks with
Chinese leaders Mao ’]‘se»tung and
(,‘hou l'In-Iai, attend a round of
four banquets iii three cities llnd
visit the (lreat Wiill and other
Chinese shrines and historic sites.

Nixon met for 45 minutes
Thursday with Democratic and
Republican congressional leaders,
giving them what House GOP1
Leader Gerald R. Ford of Michi-
gan described as “ii realistic ap-
praisal of the possible results." He
promises to brief them upon his
return.

Then, without ll topcoat to ward
off the winter chill, the President
stepped onto the South Lawn to
deliver his brief fareWell remarks.

The President recalled his state-
ment of July 15 - when he an
nouneed that a secret summer
mission to Peking by his foreign
affairs adviser, lleni‘y Kissengcr,
had set up the unprecedented
summit meeting.

"That statement was, as you will
recall, that this would be a jour-
ney for peace," he said. Nixon
noted, too, ll toilst offered by
Chou when Kissinger was in
China.

" 'Tlie American people are a
great pcoplc,‘ " be quoted the
Chinese premier as saying. “ IThe
Chinese people are a great people.
The fact that they are separated
by a vast ocean and great differ-
ences in philosophy should not
preVent them from finding com»
mon ground.‘ ”

Nixon said if his talks with
Communist leaders bring progress
toward finding that common

Log Iotive Bill:

Liquor Store Grass

A bill to legalize marijuana - with conditions —
has been introduced in the state legislature by
several legislators, including Franz S. Leichter' of
Manhattan. At a press conference Wednesday, the
bill's sponsors and Dr. Lester Grinspoon of the
Harvard Medical School discussed marijuana and the
need for reform of marijuana laws. The following
are provisions of the bill:

1. Establishing ll State Marijuana Control Authori-
ty which will license and regulate growers, pro-
ducers, manufacturers, and distributors of marijua-
na.

2. The Authority will cnforCe regulations setting
the strength of marijuana to be sold at retail and
