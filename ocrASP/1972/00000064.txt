Stop the Hike

Now it’s clear.
The secret has been unveiled, and we know that the SUNY
trustees are planning to raise tuition to $650 a year for
freshmen and sophomores and $850 for upper-classmen.
This cannot be tolerated. The financing of public educa-
tion is not a matter which can be shrugged off and met
repeatedly with tuition increases.
State universities since their inception have answered the
need to provide the masses with a college education they
can afford. The forthcoming decision of the trustees
threatens to destroy this form of public higher education in
New York, and deny the opportunity for learning and
:conomic betterment to thousands of young people across
the state.
With the increase in fees the cost to a SUNY-Albany
upperclassman living on campus will soar to the vicinity of
$2500 a year. This is an outrageous amount to ask students
largely from middle to lower income backgrounds to pay,
especially since there are no guarantees of sufficient
scholarship increases. Some students who got early word of
the tuition bikes are already seriously considering dropping
out because of filiaricial strain.
We agree in principle with the SASU and UCC platforms
of no tuition at SUNY. but feel it is economically unfcasiblc
at this time.
It is important. however. that the state at least hold the
line on tuition and maintain present fee levels. As for the
private colleges, we recognize that they merit some financial
support for absorbing students who would otherwise be
adding to the burden of state iririvcristy facilities. But the
first priority iriust be to hold down SUNY costs, so that
SUNY. as we know it, can continue to cVist.
While the individual ccrtainly benefits from his higher

education, society benefits too. Thus, we propose air exce

 

‘ s
profits tax on the major businesses arid Industries in this
state. They depend largely on the colleges, often state-
supportcd, for the people who plan, manage. and contribute
to their huge earnings.

A tax of‘just a fraction of a percent levied on profits
above a fixed level could raise millions of dollars that the
companies should be willing to pay inonlt-r to keci the
graduates coming. i
Further, we suggest

I a series of “discouragerrrerrt" taxes
aimed

‘at both raising revenues for education and dis-
couraging certain practices which are detrimental to society.

This approach worked iii New York (.‘ity. where recent

To the Editor:

The problem of providing educa-
tion beyond high school for him-
(lri-ds of thousands of students in
New York State and of keeping
the State, the City of New York,
the parents, and the student them»
selves solvent in the process, is a
very complex problem indeed.
The New York Times editorial
of January 19th, urging the State
to "contract out" students not
presently on State University cam-
puses lo the private colleges in
order to fill the 14,000 vacancies
now existing in the latter, is
sound, rational advice in the dll’EEC‘
tion of maximum utilization of
resources.

The present demand for open
enrollment li.e. admission regard-
less of prior scholastic achieve-
ment or economic status of stu-
dents and their families) is a prob‘
lem so new and radical that the
old concepts of scholarship aid
and a Luitionless City College for
the intellectually elite are superse-

ln New York State, maximum
utilitation of student time for
study and work, and maximum
utilization of college and universi~
ty plants should go hand in hand
in solving the current problems al
both State and City Universities.
Insteati of two fifteen-week terms
eireh followed by one week of
examinations, three equal fifteen-
week terms each followed by one
week of examinations could be
instituted on all or most of the
State and City campuses: January-
April, May- August, September-
December. In this way all students
could be in attendance two terms
and still have the opportunity to
work a full four-month period.

A substantial part of the State
and City University budgets is
allocated to maintenance, food
services, administrative and library
work. So many of these functions
could be performed by well super-
vrsed students. There should be no
work too humble nor perhaps 100

The Object is to Graduate

To the Editor:

A recent ASP article dealing
with the present S/U, P/F, A-E
grading dilemma brought to mind
a solution which a friend and I
worked out a couple of years ago.
The solution involwss the creation
of a university lottery, at credit
casino, and a credit stock market.

The solution is easily under-
stood oiree one accepts the pre-
mistI that course credits and
grades are academic motley. What
remains is to disburse this money
in air equitable way. This should
be done without regard to race,
color, creed, national origin, sex,
Wealth, or other inherited charac-
lci'i. cs. The following allernative
is offered in hopes of updating lhc
prescnl archaic 'ystem.

Firsl, there should be i-stal)~
lishetl a monthly lolier'y of
courses and credits. Freshmen will
be given initial cr'cdil so they can
enter the lottery. There will be
five categories of lotteries; the 1-3

 

 

credit, ‘I -6 credit, 7-9 credit,
10-12 credit, and HM Ti credit
lotteries. For each category the

player will submit a credit chip of
that category, and receive one in
exchange, Chips will be color
coded to coincide with err-(Iits airtl
grades (on an All basis for (lrad
schools and so forth) and marked
with specific course numbers.
Chips shall have small holes so
they may be strung on a chain, or
worn on a belt or necklace, thus
obtaining the proper respect from
one's peers.

Second: There shall be a Credit
Casino where onc‘s credits iind
grades may be gambled (on the
basis of credits and grades only.)

This could be simplified by using
quality points. Third: Establish a
Credit Stock Market. [ii the stock
market chips will be traded on the
basis of course. So, for instance,
two introductory science courses
might be exchanged for an upper
level humanities course.

The objccl of the game is to
graduate. This may be done at any
time by simply fulfilling the re-
quirements in any of the Bulle-
tins. Oue need only organize the
chips in such a manner as to
correspond lo one of the magic
GRADUATION combinations in
any of the major and minor fir-Ids

tees to investigate FSA and the
Administration's management of
the whole affair. Staff personnel
could be dealers, brokers, tellers,

.roupiers, etc.

On (he Other Hand all of the
games could be eliminated with
the simple abolishmcnt of the
degree in which case the only
persons left would be those who
wanted to learn. The converse of
this would be to give the degree to
everyone, but this is morally re-
pugnant to too many people.

The Disposable Era

To the Editor:

The level of ecological concern
exhibited by the SUNYA com-
munity seems to me to be quite
high. The can recycling center, the
variety of courses related to the
preservation of the planet, and the
extent of committmcnt to defend

 

as specified in any of the bulletins
in the history of SUNY/\.

The benefits of this system are
enormous, No one is excluded.
Must proli- or's will be fret-d of
the burden of having lo teach.
Those who still wish to may teach
those students who still wish to
learn. Those slrrdr-nts who are in
the university for a degree will
have the opportunity to earn one
using the skills of resourcefulness
and ingenuity so necessary for
their success once they are out of
school, Those students who are at
the universin irrsl to pass the time
are givr-n a considerably more
exciting way of doing ii. The
administration could be given the
heavy responsibility of running
the lotteries, casino, and market.
FSA would of eoirrse servr- as
THE BANK in the operation. The
University Senate, together with
lesser bodies of faculty and stu-
dent government, could suggest to
the administration improvements
and modifications of the system.
They could also appoint commit~

the environment on the part of
the individual students that I have
talked to, are irll very positive
signs.

However, i have noted one
shortcoming. The snack bar in the

Campus Center provides paper
trays, paper plates, and plastic
utensils, all of which are dispo-
sable. This is unnecessary wastage.
If durable items were acquired,
not only would some trees be
saved, but some deserving stu-
dents could be hired on as part
time dishwashers. It might cause
some inconvenience to patrons
and management, but I think it
would be better if the disposable
era ended at the snack bar.

Although the emergency powers

left an unhealthy residue in our

Government has announced its
intention to enact new legislation
dealing with peace-time emergen-

matter to a joint Senate-House

talked openly about compulsory
