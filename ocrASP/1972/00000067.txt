The main element prevailing in the gymnasium Wednesday night was
surprise. The Albany State grapplers met ii forceful Oneontii State and
us Coach Gracia gradually observed their strength and talent, the
Danes fought ii hopeless brittle.

“All I can say," Uarciii commented after the Dana's loss of JlJi-l 7,

Danes Stricken With Traveling Blues .  i

by Alan D. Abbey
“Some of the players, the more inexperienced
ones, need the cheers ot' the home crowd ringing in

their cars."

This was basketball coach Richard Saucrs com.
merit after his Danes were drubbcd, tin-()0. by Utica
College, in Uticu, Tuesday night.

“Perhaps they’re not mentally tough enough to
win without someone rooting for them. Maybe it‘s
my fault." Saiiers said. “It is probably some of the
sophomores, they are less experienced than some of
the other players."

Snuers also said that the 90-mlli- bus trip was not
so long that the team was tired out, although the
Dnnes' 37-27 halftime lead quickly evaporated from
the scoreboard in the Second half, "We were
outreboundcd in the second half, and we made
some ball handling errors when they started pressing
us," said ii disgruntled Saucrs. “Byron Miller wasn't
shooting that well, either." These reasons for the
loss probably can all be traced back to tilt! fact that
the Danes were playing on unfamiliar territory.

There were reports that the officiating was deci-
dedly “home—court," that is, slanted towards the
home team, Uticii. Sauers dismissed this saying,
“The refereeing didn’t help, but it didn't. lose the
game for us."

Bob Rossi, the Albany backcourt man, hail 22
points, Tuesday night, and it seems as if he has
finally hit his stride. He has been playing more and
more each game, and has been justifying Sauers’
faith in him by responding with big games. He has
been taking up the slack left by John Quattrocchi,
whose point production in the last two games has
been nearly imperceptible (for him that is).

“We blew our chances for an zit-large bid to the
NCAA's, and we now have to win the SUNY
Conference to get in," said Snucrs. The Danes will
get another chance at. the SUNY title this Saturday
night as they take on Cortland in a division game,
away.

  

ch aw

This game should prove to be a crucial contest as
Cortland has been steadily improving this semester
with the return of their top player. “With him
(Antin) they are 20% to 30% better," said Sauers.
Another big plus for Cortland is their home court
advantage. While the Danes have been running up it

straight home court wins this season, they have won
only three of eight on the road. "They have a big
advantage at home, and even though they are only
4-9 overall (24 in SUNY Conference), they are a
tough team," was Sriuers finiil remark.
