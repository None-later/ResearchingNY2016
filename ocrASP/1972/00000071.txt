inantly Greek island because of an open rift with
the military government in Greece.

It was the first public admission by a member of

frontation that has arisen between Nicosia and
Athens.

“Woe unto us if we fail to avert the horrors and
terrible coiiseiiuencics of a l'ratricidal war," said
Epaminondas Komodromos, minister of interior and
defense.

The crisis erupted eight days ago when the Greek
junta in Athens presented an ultimatum to Ma»
karios, ’i‘licy demanded he surrender a large quan-
tity of secretly imported Czech arms and form and
government of national unity including represen-
tatIVcs of his arch rival, Gen. George Grivas.

Death Penalty Killed in California

SAN FRANSISCO AP - The
California Supreme Court de-
clared Friday that the death pen-
alty is unconstitutional, and it
reduced the death sentences of
102 men and five women to life
imprisonment.

The court, in a 6-1 decision, said
execution was “incompatible with
the dignity of man and the judi-
cial process." The court held that
execution was cruel and unusual
punishment.

Among those removed from the
shadow of death sentences were
Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, convicted
slayer of Sen. Robert. if, Kennedy,
and Charles Manson, convicted in
the murders of actress Sharon
Tate and six others.

Citing the steady nationwide de-
crease in the number of execu~
tions from a high of 199 in l935
to two in 1067, the court said this
“demonstrates that capital punish-
ment is unacceptable to society
today." One-seventh of these con
demned to death in the US. are in
California.

Condemned men are held on
San Quentin Prison's death row.
The women are in a special wo-
men's section of the row built al
the California institute for Wo-
men at Frontera in Southern Cali

fornia.

Three of Manson’s followers -
Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten
and Patricia Krenwinkel - are in
the women's section.

“Most of the men are pretty
happy about it," said San Quen-
tin's Associate Warden James W.
Park. “There are no demonstra-
tions or anything like that. Most
of them now are in a WaitAatid-see
attitude. They want to see exactly
what the court said."

In Sacramento, Gov. Ronald
Reagan‘s press secretary, Paul
Beck, said it had not been decided
whether to appeal the court‘s rul»
ing.

“We won‘t have any comment
on the d ion until we have seen
it and read it, and that may not be
today," he added.

Anthony Amsterdam Stanford
University law professor repre-
senting the American Civil Liber-
ties Union in the case, argued that
the death penalty is spottily ap-
plied to "the miserable and social-
ly unacceptable" and “has been
repudiated by enlightened staii~
dards of decency."

The legal attack against the
death penalty specifically involved
the case of Robert Page Anderson,
who was sentenced to death for
the filling of a San Diego sl'ttip'

 

DEVlIN JAllED

BELFAST, Northern Ireland AP
- A Belfast court sentenced Berna-
dette Devlin on Friday to six
months in jail for marching in an
illegal parade last Christmas in
Belfast. It released her on bail
after she announced she would
appeal.

Sentenced with her was Frank
McManus, who with Miss Devlin is
a member of the British Parlia-
ment from Northern Ireland. Ele-
ven other marchers received the
same sentence and all joined Miss
Devlin and McManus in the appeal
and were freed on bail of $260
each.

Miss Devlin, 24, and the other
civil rights marchers said they
intended to appeal to the highest
court, perhaps own the House of
Lords in London. This could take
months.

Miss Devlin, McManus and 24
other persons were brought into
court in Ncwry last Tuesday, on
charges of illegal marching Feb. 6
but won a month’s postponement.
’i‘hey considered this a victory,

A conviction of violating Nortli~

six-month jail term.

(CPS)—' Four hundred university and college stu-

across the nation have declared their support for
South Dakota Senator George McGovern, who is
seeking the democratic presidential nomination.

McGovern is “the man who is most responsive to
the needs and wishes of the people," according to ii
statement signed by the 400 supporters.

McGovern for President groups are now in opera-

However, the nationally-conducted Harris Survey
reports that McGovern's support continues to be
weak among young and old voters alike.
