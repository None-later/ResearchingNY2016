Aquamen Split Pair; Relay Sets Record

By Ira Mozille

During the great snowfall of
last Saturday, the Albany State
swimming team travelled to Long
Island to meet Stony BWOk and
Columbia University in a triangu-
lar match. Depressed by their re-
cent loss to Oneonta State, the
mermen were eager and ready.
Through this regained confidence,
the Danes beat .Stony Brook, but
lost to a strong Columbia team.

In the 400 yard medley relay,
Bill I-Iart, Les l’urctz, Marc Esori,
and Pete Gerstenliaber placed first
in 1:082. Albany also captured
first in the 1000 yard freestyle

with Lennie Van Ryn beating
Stonyﬁook in a commendable
11:21.1.

Other Albany individual wins
were Gerstenhaber in the 200 yd.
individual medley with a quick
time of 2:18.2; Jaik Schubert fin-
ished in 2133.9 in the 200 yd.
butterfly. Hart won the 200 yd.
backstroke in 2119.2, and Van
Ry“ again placed first in an
individual event by swimming
5:28 in the 500 yd. freestyle.

The meet came down to the
400 yard freestyle relay,
Columbia was already out in front
with a big enough lead. The Danes
were faced with a battle for sec-
ond place with Stony Brook.

"The score before the event,"
Coach Kelly said afterwards, “wan
54-52 in favor of Stony Brook. In
a relay, the winner takes seven
points and the loser nothing.
Albany had to take that relay to
beat out Stony Brook. Knowing
what they had to do, Ed Daniel,
Eson, Gerstenhaber, and Van
Ryn finished in a fast 3140.2,
setting a new varsity record, and
pulled second place out for
Albany. This relay team beat
Oneonta last week.

The final score was Columbia
(55, Albany 18, and Albany 59,
Stony Brook S-l.

When asked about next Week’s
meet against Binghamton, Coach
Kelly had this reply, “They won’t
be tough, but it'll be very close."
Last year, Binghaniton beat
Albany 57-56, and this year they
beat Stony Brook by three points.
With Van Ryn, llrirt,
(ierstt-nhrihcr and the rest of the
team in good shape, the cards are
lli  ' Ilaiics' favor.

As the Great Dane basketball
team prepared for a crucial Imiguc
grime at Cortland Saturday night,
Doc Sauers and the boys ran into
an unexpected foe: Mother Na-
ture. The beginnings of a huge
snowstorm forced Cortland to
cancel the SUNYAC game, thus
ending a rough week for the
Danes. In addition to losing to
Utica and having the Cortland
game postponed, Albany also
learned that the Bounds decision
(concerning Brockport‘s having to
forfeit their games) was delayed at
least a Week.

The Danes,lll-5, now look
hopefully to their most important
week of the season, on the court
as well as off, The Danes host
New Paltz on Wednesday night, in
their final home game. Iier'riusc
the game is a league contest,
Albany must win. Despite a dis-
mal record, the Hawks beiil
Ochgo on the latter's home
court, by 17 points, while Albany
topped ()swego by just it, New
Paltz relies on a zone press, and is
led by 6'6" center Don Voldcz.
On Saturday, the Danes fly to the

University of Buffalo, for a very
tough non-league game.

Meanwhile, the Drine's hopes
for an NCAA bid could be de—
cided this week. On Tuesday af-
ternoon, a SUNY conferenCc
meeting will probably rule on
Bounds eligibility. A forfeit of all
of Broekport games could result,
thus putting Albany into a tie for
first place with Buffalo State. (The
Danes would get the SUNYAC
title over Buffalo, and get an auto‘
matic bid to the Elistcrn Regionals
of the NCAA--providing they beat
New Paltz and Cortland.)

In another meeting this week,
the fch mrin NCAA committee
Wil probably reduce the twelve
team field being considered for
the Eastern Regionals. However,
one or two bids might. be handed
out. A site for the games also
must be chosen. Albany has an-
oiitside shot of being picked. Four
learns will play in the ltegionals,
but two extra teams could be
chosen to playoff for one or even
two of the spots in the tourney.
'l‘lie Regionals will probably be
held on March it) and II, with
the winner going to Evansville,
Indiana for the NCAA finals.

'l‘he liavus arid the liave‘nots,
who have been at each others'
throats since the beginning of
time, are at it once again, only
this time the battleground is the
National Collegiate Athletic Coti-
ference.

As always, the issue is money.

The large universities in the,
NCAA, the ones with the big
football programs, want to contin»
tie the practice of giving athletic
scholarships. 'l‘hey wiin to see this
system perpetuated because they
would lose great face, and chamv

W

pionsliip football teams, if they
could no longer recruit.

The smaller institutions, such as
Albany State, want the rules
changed so that the only athletic

'grants'in-aid would be given on

the basis of need. Possibly the
smaller schools want this because
they cannot afford to keep up
with the bigger schools recruiting
practices

Albany is a member of the
Eastern College Athletic Con-
fcrcnce, as well as the NCAA, and
the ECAC has come up with a
plan for reorganization (as have

many others). The ECAC plan is
not without its merits though, and
possibly would eliminate some of
the problems the other plans can-
not seem to solve. Basically, the
plan, which was originally drawn
up to help the ECAC to reor-
ganize itself, sets up three divisiom

Division A would include the
larger universities who place great
emphasis on their athletic pro
grams. Class B would be for smal-
ler schools, but ones wtiose teams
litiVe a hiin quality. Division C
(the one in which Albany coin-
petes) is for the smallest schools,
with the least emphasis on sports.
'I‘licse general guidelines would
hopefully be enough.

Athletics here, supports the I'lt'At‘
