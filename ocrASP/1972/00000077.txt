MAILER

“Why did you come to Albany. anyway?”

“Earn some money."

That was Norman Mailer’s reply, as the writer, film
producer, and one-time New York City mayoral candidate
agreed to a rather informal interview. It was just that blend
of frankness and honesty which pervaded both the airport
interview and his speech before a full, predominantly

,student. audience in the Campus Center Ballroom late last

evening.

At both places, Mailer focused on a variety of his political
and social views and offered some insight into what many
feel is his illusive character.

A major theme which occurred again and again in his talks
concerned the aspect of amateurism versus professionalism.
Mailer feels that the era of the professional is dying and is
being replaced by a new period of amateurism.

He offered his own life as an example of this new
direction. Though a professional writer. Mailer‘s non-
professional film productions and work in the political
sphere illustrate this “rise of the amateur." “Both ended in
failure." Mailer said. but explained that the success was
actually found in his abilities of improvisation. It is a
parallel course that many others are following.

Political Views

Mailer dismissed politics as a "marvelous joke." “The
Democrats are the ones who always want to bring in the
‘Great Society' and the ‘Brave New World‘: the Republicans
are always the ones who want to stop communism. But the
fact ofthe matter is. the Republicans make all the pacts and
all the treaties with the communists. and the Democrats
fight the Republicans“ wars for them." Thus. Mailer is rather
indifferent to this year‘s presidential race. though he does
express some support for Eugene McCarthy and Ted
Kennedy. “If Ted Kennedy were to run." Mailer said. “that
would be exciting. Gene McCarthy is not as exciting. but
has a finer mint‘ and tougher mentality."

As for himself. he dismisses a quick ‘e—cntry into the
political scene. “I don‘t think any group of people will ask
me to run for mayor again in a hurry. I had my fling, ifyou
will."

 

Little Societies

His alternative to the present political and societal
structures is a novel one. It is a prediction of a formation of
“little societies" within our present society where minorities
of people will find a more satisfying life style. “I'm a great
believer in turf and the right of peop'e to do on that turf
what they want to do . . . there are a lot ofwomen, for
example. who would like to establish women's libertarian
societies. Well why not?” The problem as he views it. is a
structural one. “The trouble with American society is that
there are not enough avenues of commitment open. People

can be powerfully connected to certain ideas but there's.

nothing they can do about those ideas." _

It is this concept of minority based “tiny republics" that
will offer numbers of alienated people an alternative to the
centralized bureaucracy and an opportunity to live life on
their own terms.

Maidstone

Mailer‘s most recent effort in cinema was a further topic
of discussion. Maidsrorie. which will be shown on campus,
was dubbed “the Gone Willi the Wind of the underground“
by Mailer.

“it was officially difficult, officially irritating. officially a
pain in the ass,” he told his audiencq. “but I've got to
brainwash all of you."

He urged all to see it claiming “It's delicate. it's terribly
delicate. At its best it‘s like a beautiful lady. who needs the
most careful lighting and the best makeup, She doesn't
make it in a harsh light."

()nly Questions

hours. there is much to come. He is Working on .i new book.

return to his movie making efforts. llut the speiifits of his
future and the success of the philosophy he expounds
remain dubious. For as he told his audience at one point:

“There are no answers left. only questions."

Capital Correspondent

SUNY tuition for state residents
will rise to $650 for freshmen and
sophomores. $800 for juniors and
seniors, $1,200 for graduate studs
ents and $1,600 for students in
professional programs according
to Chancellor Ernest L. Boyer.
The hike is effective this summer.

Terming the tuition hikes a
“do‘iL—yourself" method for help-
ing to finance SUNY. the Chan-
cellor added that the increases
were designed so that students
with the ability to pay would, in a
sense, be helping others who
could not. He also stressed that
although the rates were increased.
the Trustees realized that low and
middle income students had to be
“protected.”

Tuition Differential

Boyer justified the tuition dif-
ferential between lower and upper
clussmen by claiming that "two
years of post high school educ-
ation is basic..." He also con-
tended thal it “costs more as a
student moves along..." Boyer
claimed that ii. costs about $1 100
to educate each lower classmnn
and about. $1700 for an upper
elassmzin. Another defense given
for the different. fees was lhal
students who continue past their
first two years stand to gain more
economically. According to Boyer
they are “put in a privileged sit-
uation..." The Chancellor stated
that the tuition differential “is
new to my knowledge and has no
precedent..."

Financial Aid

In order to offset the impact of
the higher tuition, the Trustees
established an aid formula which
will mean that students whose
parents' not taxable incomes are
less than $2000 will pay no
iiiilioii. Students whose l'amilies'
iii-l laxable incomes are lii'lwm-ii
$2,000 and $1,200 will pay no

entive awards and the
tuition—and tuition waivers (see
charts). According to Boyer.
scholar incentive must cover aid
formulas, and by law will follow
the tuition hikes. Boxer claimed
that 78% of SUNY students come
from families with nel. taxable
income of less than $12,000. He
also claimed that only 15% of
SUNY students pay full tuition.
Along with their decision to
hike tuition, the SUNY Trustees
also adopted a resolution in sup-
port of a $1,000 increase in the
maximum yearly loan students
may receive through the New
York Education Assistance Corp-
oration. This would raise the loan
ceiling from the current yearly
amount of $1,500 to $2.500.

$20 Million in Revenue Generated

As a result of the tuition hike
SUNY is estimated to generate
some $20-$30 million in revenue.
Boyer stated that after provisions
for scholar aid—waivers and
SUNY Scholarships~were made.
SUNY could expect to have a
remaining profit of some $18-$20
million.

Funding Priorities

With these additional funds
Boyer hopes to increase enroll-
ment by 1,000 students lhus
bringing the number of new
SUNY students to 5.600 for next.
year, lie also listed support for
the EOl’-—in order to keep it up to
the level of funding of last
year~and aid to the disadvan-
taged—in order to keep it up to
this year’s level of funding—as
priorities for the newly acquired
funds. Increased aid for the
upstate and downstate medical
centers and funds to help the new
health sciences eenti-r at Stony
Brook take in ll freshman class are
also expected to come from the
luilion revenue. Boyer also claim-
i-d lhal the new funds would help

that the governor's “hold the

actually giving SUNY less than it
received last year because of an
additional $30 million in costs to
the system this year. He indicated
that there were “no new tax

Students Organize

by Debbie Niitiinsohn

1n reaction to the Chancellor's announced Luilion hike. SUNYA
students filled the fireside lounge Wednesday night and called for a
complete tuition rollback.

The students will be supporting three demands developed at a
statewide conference of eiimpus representatives held here two weeks
ago:

-No luilion at SUNY or (JUNY

No cutbacks in education

No piiblie aid to non-public schools ()lhiir campuses throughout the
stale are mobilizing under these demands. and will join Albany in
denouncing the iuilion hikes.

Various eoniiniliei-s were set up a! the meeting to begin work on
pelilioniiig, lobbying, and community organization. A rally at the
(‘lizniei-llor's office on ’l‘hurlow Terrace is scheduled for this Monday
a1 Noon. A slatewnle demonstration is planned for March 1/1 at the
(fapilol; Ihousands of stiidenls are expected to rally in Albany to
impress upon their legislators that they will not vote for anyone who
supports the (lovernor's cutbacks in education.

A large number of students at the meeting expressed the willingness
to close down the univvrsily should the budget. go through and the
Million liike remain, Others suggesli-d that no one pay their bills, iind
that the biirsiir‘s office l)(.‘ bloekaded so that it would be impossible
for anyone to pay.

Stressed at the meeting was that the lime element involved in the
illlll' tiiilioii campaign is of the utmost importance. The legislature
will begin deliberating on (lovernor Roekefeller's state budget in
Mlerll. They must VuLe on the budget by March 3151 for it to take
effect on April list as planned, Therefore, there is little more than one
month left to urge the legislators to vote against the educational
eulbiieks.

Although it is the Board of Trustees which establishes tuition rates,
these charges are largely based on what the state iilloLs to the SUNY
system The lobbying committee formed at the meeting Wedensduy
Will coneenlriite on enlisting students to go down to the Capitol in
order to eoiivince legislators to allocate money in education. The
students will attempt to impress upon the lawmakers that SUNY und
(IUNY combined represents ii voting constituency of over 600.000.
