PEKING (AH—President Nixon stood at the
Great Wall of China today and expressed the hope
that his visit would mark the beginning of the end
to walls between people.

“As we look at this wall," the President said,
“what is most important is that we have an open
world. We don’t want walls of any kind betwoen
peoples.

“One result of this trip, we hope, may be that
walls erected, whether physical like this wall, or
whether they are other walls, ideological or philo-
sophical, will not divide the people of the world,"

close-chambers hearing that
Superior Court Judge Richard E.
Arnason had set ball at $102,500.

The judge also ordered that Miss
Davis' triiil on murder, kidnap

Asked how Arnason responded
to the prosecution argument, Har-
rls said:"He feels no good purpose
will be served by delay.”

“1 think what; he is doing is
contrary to law,“Harris said, but
he added that the state plans no
appeal.

Miss Davis, 28, is charged in the
Aug. 7, 1970, shooting that
claimed four lives at the
courthouse in San Rafael, north
of San Francisco.

She is accused of furnishing four
guns used in the shooting. The
four victims Were a judge, two
convicts and a youth who helped
the convicts in an escape attempt.

Harris said Arniisori stipulated
that Mis Davis could be freed on
the posting of $2.500 cash and a
$l 00,000 bond.

The Natiniial United Committee
to Free Angela Davis had an-

Prior to the state Supreme ('nuri

Is Corning’s Budget 3 Fraud?

By Ed Potsliowstii
Second in a Series

This writer visited City Hall and
spoke in Controller Hoffman in
an attempt to examine certain
public reco :ls. llaviiig resided in
the city of Albany for the past
three years and being a registered
dri and voter from this city,
the author considers himself a
cut/.en of Albany witli the riglil
to examine public city docu
iiieiits 'l'ltat right, however, Was
dciiieil liv Controller Hoffman
\vbii informed this reporter that
since he paid no property taxes,
he couldn't examine public city

 

records

The (loiitrollcr suggested that
this reporter write a letter and
request permission to view city
records. He indicated that he
might “consider granting perniis
sion."
'l‘liis reporter promptly went. to
tltc State Attorney (lencrttl‘s ()f-
lice and spoke to legal counsel. A
staff member, who wishes to re
main unidentified, said that “As
far its lknow, tltere is no such
property requirement to view
public city records; but to be
certain, a court. challenge would
have to be made."
After consulting with the legal
counsel at thc State Attorney

considering legal action against

The city found it way to finance
this deficit, though. The report
outlines the city program of is-

rowing on expected tax income).

flllltl deficit was approximately
$11,200,000 and there were out-

this fiscally sound” The report
notes that “There was iioslatltto-
ry authority to issue these notes."
This practice continued in
Infill-7U “contrary to law." This
reporter was unable to examine
current records to determine if
this practice continues.

Mrs. Cooke and the 'l‘axpayers‘
Association will attempt to (its
cover what the city is doing to
remedy the poor budgetary prac»
tices of the past and present.
“What,” she asks, “is the city
doing to increase its revenue aside
