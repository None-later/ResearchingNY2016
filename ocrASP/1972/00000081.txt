The Men Without A Country-
Draft Dodgers and Deserters

During an election year, all sorts
of issues that politicians are usu-
ally more than happy to let lie
begin to crop up—and ’72 is no
exception. With the Vietnam war,
and schemes for ending it still a
major item in every candidate’s
sales pitch, amnesty for draft
resisters and deserters is one such
issue. Recently it has found its
way into every newspaper and
glossed the cover of more than
one popular magazine.

Various senators and congress-
men have begun debate in Con-
gress, Democratic hopefuls have
taken their stands, and Nixon has
laid his cards on the table. "We
always, under our system, provide
amnesty” he told CBS correspon-
dent Dan Rather. “I for one
would be very liberal with regard
to amnesty, but not while there
are Americans in Vietnam fight-
ing to serve their country...”

But what are the chances that
amnesty will actually become a
reality? What form would that
amnesty take? And what do those
men currently in exile or prison-
an estimated 100,000—think of
the various amnesty proposals. all
of which call for a required peri<
rid of “alternative” service upon
an exile's return or release'.’

"The reaction of those who left
the United States because of the
war is rage,” writes Lawn-nee
Suirehev, who works at the Amer-
ican Exile Counseling Center in
Montreal. “Many draft resistors
who would have done alternative
service three or five years ago
now say they better understand
the imperialist nature of the U.S.
government and no longer recog-
nize it as legitimate."

“To us," American exile Jack
Calhoun writes in a re -nt issue
of Win magazine, “the 'crime' of
not participating in such a war
pales beside that which our gov-
ernment asked us to commit in
the name of democratic citizen-
ship. After the Galley trial and
the Pentagon Papers, it should be
clear to all that we have been
honorably vindicated.

Deserters Overlooked

Critics of the amnesty proposah
point to the fact that deserters
are consistently excluded, as one
of the most glaring ommissions.
Even Sen. George McGovern, who
was one of the first to give
sup art to a ener | ' p

 

   

 

posal, and who most people con-
sider the most liberal on the issue,
has said nothing about deserters.

Calhoun outlines the deserters'
situation:

“Deserters are for the most
part, a very different breed of
person from draft dodgers...l em-
phasize ‘for the most part‘ be-
cause it is important not to con-
tribute to already extant stercoA
types. In the main, deserters tend
to be of working class origins,
poorly educated, and inarticulate
about the reasons for their war
resistance, whereas draft dodgers
tend to be of middle class back-
grounds, well educated, and artic-
ulate about their objections to
the war...

“Dodgers usually have had the
luxuries of education, family con-
nections, and sympathetic profes-
sional advice to help them formu-
late their thinking before they are
confronted with induction. in
:ontrast, the deserter stands quite
alone in a hostile military envi-
ronment, the callousnesii and bru-
tality of which has made him
come to terms with his personal
involvement

with the military and the war."

Helpina Exiles Abroad
Thercare many peoplehowevn,

who feel that amnesty is not even
a political possibility at this time;
that politicians are not seriously
committed to amnesty but are
oiin playing with the issue to lure
votes. llarry Pincus, extled in Bri-
tain for three years bcforc an
indictment for turning in his draft
card was dismis d in March 1971,
is one of those whom the politi»
cians havu not convinced.

Rather than have people placi-
wild hopes on the political ploy of
amnesty, Pincus would like to see
energies directed towards publICl'Ix
ing the plight of American exiles
throughout the world and fight
to establish their rights. That pub-
licity, he feels, would give valua-
ble new impetus to the anti-war
movement.

I “We‘ve got to get people famil-
iar with the word ‘Americun refu-
get-’," stressed Pincus. who now
works for the American Refugee

 

ty, membership in a particular
social group, or political opinion.
Certainly opposing the Vietnam
war is a political opinion."

Already, exiles and sympathizers
are becoming increasingly organ-
ized in countries such as England,
France, Sweden, Japan, Switzer-
land, Denmark, Canada, and in
the United States. Each country
has a very different policy
towards American “civilian” refu-
gees (draft resistors) and “milita-
ry“ refugees (desertersl.

Canada is Most Recef’ll"e

Canada, the country that first
comes to mind when people think
of exiles, has been the most len~
ient and receptive country though
it iLfar from perfect. The Canadi-
an government considers all men
who crow the border to avoid the
“NY, "ordinary aliens " which
means they fall under the coun-
try‘s point system of admitting
people.

The point system works to get
the "most desirable" people into
the country. Points are given for
education, the amount of money
you haVc, job skills, etc. These
criteria ultimately discriminate
against the military refugee who
more than likely does not have
much education or money A civi-
lian ri-fugce who has just gradua»
ll'd from college and lost lis 2-S
draft status, has a better chance.

Though the majority of Ameri-
can refugees are now living in
Canada, the movement to gain
political refugee status is not as
pronounced as in other countries.
That is due in part to the fezr thit
thc Canadian govurnment's rela-
tively liberal position might
swerve to the right if a loth
publicity created pressure from
the United States.

Exile groups in many countries
have begun to struggle for their
rights with the hope of encourag-
ing their brothers to join them.
The American Refugee Project has.
dso been trying to put pressure
on the UN to support refugee
status for American exiles. "The
Vietnamese have proven that pa-
tience and stamina can win," said
Pincus. “And we will win.”

situations of oppression here on this campus are

We, the homosexuals of the SUNYA campus, are,
at long last coming to terms with our oppression —
an oppression which is an extension of the attempt-

ed abortion of all

the liberating forces in this

country. An appeal is being made to you, our gay
sisters and brothers, to unite into one force — a
force which will tell the students, faculty, and
administration of this school that we are here — and
we affirm the right to exist openly and honestly
along with our heterosexual sisters and brothers.
The time for dialectics has long since passed. The

The current I’lll’llCtllllllLlUtl pcr-
iod has rcccntly witnessed the
emergence of it new and dynamic
iiiovcmcnl for social change, one
which would have bi-cn unthink-
able in America only a few years
ago, the (lay Liberation Move-
ment.

The Gay Liberation Mow-ment
is by no means merely a part of
the “cultural revolution.” that is,
iiol merely ii matter of new life
stylcs, and so on. On the contrary,
ll is lhe century‘s ovcrdiic rebel-
lioii against male oppression and
:igiiiiisi some of the most dehu-
niiiiiixiiig superstitions ever
known.

Scii-iilificopiiiionregarding homo-
sexual hi-liavnir is aptly summed
up by Kinsey, l’onii-roy, and Mar-
|iii in llii-ir famous studies: “The
lioiiiosi-xuiil has bccn a significant
pai'l of human sexual activity ever
since the il..wn of history, primari~
ly because It is illl expression of
capacities that are basic in he
human animal." lndi-i-d, even in
our own hruinlly repressive socie-
ty, hoinoscxual acts are a com-
monly occurring form of activity
found among all classes anti all
kinds of women and men. [No less
that 37% of adult American males
haVc had at Icasl one homosexual
i‘xpl'rll‘ttCt' Lliat. resulted in or-
gasm.)

Ycl. this harmless, commonly
occurring and even ordinary form
of human activity can hardly even
now hc discussed frccly. Homo-
sexuality is still chated .. some-
thing niyin-rious and uncanny,
after the dictate of the old "anon
law which defined homosexual
acts as “ilic sin so lll)rrlllll' that it

We ask, at this point, that you do one thing —
assess the value of a freedom of responsibility and
compare it to the value of a slavery of a plastic

compromises your right to sexual freedom and

including intense fear of homosex

few months ago, ii llltl‘l‘lll iiziiiicd

ignorant article in lliii'pcr's, stated
that ll|’ would consider nothing iii
ihi- world that could hiippen in
one of his sons worstI tliiin for liiiii
in become tl hoinoscxuiil.

The American language has ii
word - "queer" which carries
with ll iiii llt‘l'llsltllUil of liomoscx
iiiility. "Qiiccr" may, however. he
applied to ii vnrieiy of non-coli-
formists who might never have
liiid ii homosexual experience. A
woman who dares to show signs
of more independence or intelli-
gi-nce lhiiii culturally iillowcil,
min fiiiil herself put down its
"queer." We have recently wit-
nessed guy-baiting used iit times as
n weapon to attack women's liber-

ation movements. Apparently it
was anticipated a fear of being
thought “queer” would make wo-
men forget about organizing for
freedom.

The male role in America is
largely built around tlic terrible

dread of being thought “Quer-r.‘
in order not to bc “queer,” an
American male must be rigid,
tough aggressive, emotionless, iiiid
humorlcss. He may new-r express
affection to another male, except,
under Lhc guise of obscenity,
drunkcnncss, or horseplay. Brutal-
ity is a potential ing‘cdieiit of the
“noii~qui-iir" male, as well as an
underlying conli-mpt for women.
The ideal “nun-quccr" male is an
incomplete human hcing ~ it
caricalurc who is incapable of
forming n meaningful rclationship
Willi cilhcr si'x. Above all. the
“iiiiii-qiicci" llllllt‘ is a conl'orniisl,
lhi- current ideal for which being a

needless to say, gent-rally co
tent with ruling class intercs.,
Contradictory as it may seem, the
ideal “non-queer" male shows ab-
solute anrl unquestionng obedi»
ence to authority, especially if the
authority is military.

At this point, some of the rele-
vancc of gay liberation to the
antiwar movement may become
apparent. Consider why Young
men are willing to give their lives
in ii military adventure they might
believe to be wrong. Are they
afriiid of being thought “queer”?
Consider the quality of a civiliza~
tion that is highly solicitous about
the sex lives of its young, but is
willing to squander their lives in
imperialist wurs. Compare the
likely “disgrace” (unpunished )) of
ii soldier kiiuwn to have commilt-
ed atrocities against civiliiiiis with
the “disgracc” (dishonorable dis-
charge, forfeiture of bent-fits, etc.)
of ii soldii-r found in the arms of
his buddy. We have Just heard that
ill. (‘allcy has been declared sane.
iii the context of American cul-
Iiirc, no doubt he is.

To conclude. giiy libcrulion is a
dynamic. highly diVi-rsc move‘
ment representing thousands and
potentially millions of people in

iii indicate the forms and direc-
tions its actions will take. The
mow-ment is by its nature revolu
tummy, and its it develops, links
should be made with other llbl‘l‘ll'
iion struggles against the common
enemy.

Lliiy liberation means an end in
savage and unjust persecution, ii
great step forward toward I'llllOll‘
iiliiy and ii suncr world. Giiy liber-
ation is ii struggle against the
crippling fear of homosexuality
which limits and destroy all hu‘
man relationships in our society,
including the heterosexual.

(lay liberation undercuts the
major support of militarism.

Gay liberation emails ending a
iiceilless source of idivisivuncss

(lay liberation represents ii rich
source of potential recruits to
