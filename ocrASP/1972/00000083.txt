Student Life Insurance

Called Worthless

by John Fairhall

Unless a college student has
children, as a rule he should not
buy life imurance. In fact, says
the nonprofit Consumes Lhion
" the list tll'ng most college
students need is He insurance."

Isn't it difficult to sell a policy
to someone who can't afford it?
Insurance men have their sales
pitch so progammd to this hurdle
that they can often turn it into a
selling point. Says Consumers
Union, they approach
the premium paying problem by
offering to finance the first annual
premium, and frequently the
second, with a loan to be paid off
perhaps five years later.

As an example of what
life-insurance loans can cost, the
nonprofit consumer organization
tells of a $10,000 policy sold by
Fidelity Union Life of Dallas in
1970. The 21-year<old student
purchaser paid an annual Interest
rate of 8.5 per cent. The
compounded finance charge on
the first year premium loan of
$151 comes to $76.07.

From the creditor's standpoint,
such loans are among the safest
imaginable, says Consumers
Union. Its full report on the sale
of life insurance to students,
contained in the January issue of
Consumer Reports, explains why

Ill

 

the lender's risk is so minimal.

The promissory note itself has
built into it an acceleration clause,
a typical feature of retail
installment contracts. If the
students fails to pay any
premiums on time, the lender can
demand immediate payment of
the entire loan. With the
'promissory note, he can also
readily obtain a court judgment
ordering payment.

Entitled "Caveat Emptor on
Campus," the Cato-ms Union
report, warns that as with most
retail credit agreements, an
insurance policy financing note
may be impossible to cancel. Life
insurance is customarily sold for a
year at a time. When a student is
persuaded to buy a policy and
sign a financing agreement, he is
committing himself to buy a full
year's protection.

None of the policies or
promissory notes examined by
Consumers Union had a provision
for refund of premium during the
first year.

Campanies doing a big business
in college policies often sat up
special amnts in college towns.
They like to recruit its salesmen
popular campus figures such as
fraternity loaders, recently
graduated star athletes, former
coaches and even faculty members
ind administrators.

Onc professor at Michigan State
University is cited its reporting
some students he interviewed
didn't know they were signing a
contract committing thorn to buy
insurance; Somo thought thoy
wuro signing a medical forin.
Others thought they were getting
a first year’s Insurance free.
All were being sued by the same
insurance companv.
