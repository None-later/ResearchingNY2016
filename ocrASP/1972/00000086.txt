Radio Antics of the Firesign Theatre

Dear Friends--The Firesign Theatre
Review by Art Kleiner

The Firesign Theatre is to humor as NASA is to air travel. They go
so far beyond normal album humor as to make it obsolete. Such
albums as Don’t Crush that Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers, (Columbia C
30102) and All Hail Marx and Lennon,(CS 9884) combine studio
production techniques and comedy instinct into about the most
perfect comic recordings imaginable. Albums like Waiting for the
Electrician,(CS 9518) and I Think We’re All 30205 on this Bus, (C
30737) use satire as a starting point to launch into semi-philosophical
probes of American history and society.

You can listen to Firesign Theatre and have more fun with them
than in almost any other experience. Or you can listen for the puns,
subtly hidden messages, and double entendres which lurk behind
almost every line. Or you can listen beyond those for the deeper
themes and satires. Don‘t Crush lhal Dwarf, for example, provides
glimpses of a sectored, curfewcd, sterile future world, which tie in
with the World War II atmosphere of War movies and high school
madness. school madness. Dear Friends, (Columbia KG 31099) is
not for the casual Firesign Theatre listener. It consists ol‘iive
segments, averaging three minutes in length, from various California
radio programs which the group performed regularly between albums.
The unity and production of thestudio albums is missing, particularly
in the improvisations, which as ii whole don't measure up to the
written material. The humor,in places, 's as funny and fast-moving, as
in the T.B. Glide sequence, or the Giant Toad Supermarket
commercial:

Noiu, agglutinated beans, gin"! and hypo size, two [or 470. Ma
Rainy's moleski‘n cookies, buy the (an a! $I.H7. Save on [much
pitthis week only, see our boy a! the buck. Dog food [or (he doggie?
Well, doggone it, we go! all six uari'lies of Marlyr brand kidney and
beef waffle!

There arcsomc amusing and appropriate satires of specific radio and
TV programs, such as Sesame Street and those Columbia House 40
greatest hit album commercials. However, the rest of the album is
deadwei‘ght, with one or two lines of any significance or comedy in a
three minute segment. Whoever edited the album displayed too much
sentimentality, for there is much on the double album that could
have been cut (for example, most of the fiist side) to provide a fairly
tight single album. As it is, if they sell it at normal double album
price, (Blue Note expects to receive it Wednesday) it won't be worth
the 005' to anyone except die»hard Firesign Freaks

*iese Firesign Theatre freaks, however, the album will he
tremen doust valuable. For one thing, it shows the origin ofsome of

each character in each segment, iind those with an ear for voices can

apply this to other albums. For example, one learns that the vu'ce of

Principal Peep is Phi Proctor. To make it more interesting, they could

have dated the segments That would give more of an idea of how the

Theatre progressed and developed, and how this iiffe tied the different

albums '

In short, it's a very funny album by anys tandards except those of
the Firesign 'I‘leatre, People who have only heard All Hail Marx and
Lennon, the Nick Danger album, wuild be disappointed with Dear
Friends.

The price w tri' t make a difference to the Firesign fre dt, who will

Let me preface this review by noting Ihm H mm
get a little weird being a white rcvicivcr tackling All
artist whose music is so iiiiciiscly black... and so
beautifully black. I do not share ll'M‘ ciiliiiml
background or the shared fccling of oneness with
one's people that Ralisann projects. I can oiin
respond lo the feelings and ilic responses \vnhin
myself that this man's music evokes for mc, The
ability to project such feeling and emotion across
cultural gulfs can bc (‘UllSldt‘n‘il to he oni- mum“.
of the univ‘prsaliiy and grcatncss of an artist. By ihai
standard. Rahsnam is an iiriisl lo be reckoned \\‘III|_

There are scattered across llh‘ Iniid various small
clumps of Rahsaan freaks“ individuals \vliosc cino
tioiizil cores have been touched by this blind gciiius.
Most of them, hoivcvcr, were first touched by

Ralisaan in person. Kirk has hccii primarily ii Iii-c
artist - his recorded oiilpul has been uneven and
somewhat difficult for [lie cursory listener to
immerSe himself in. Blackiiuss should begin to
change that, exposing Kirk to a larger audiancc, for
it is easily the most accessible of Kirk‘s LP's.

It is really a "formula" album - most oftlie (lines
contained in it are well-known soul standards - Am '1
No Sunshine, My Girl, Ncucry‘on Say Goodbye. and
WM“? Gal". 0" being the standouts. Kirk exchcws
the pushing efforts of Natural Black Inventions, his
last LP, in favor of a more restrained, engaging style,
He establishes a melodic and smoothly flowing bag
and stays with it. tossing off here and there the sly
little embellishments that remind you of his mastery
without disrupting the smooih flow of the music.

Since I am not a product of tlial culture ll would
be presumptuous for me to try lo delermini- exactly
what it is that he is tapping licrc. Though I can't
classify it intellectually, I can fch the edges he
projects emotionally * it is moving.

The sidemen on this album are solid, competent
musicians. Particular notice should be givvn to
electric gmtarisl Billy Butler. Listen to his opening
lead on lilaclrnuss whilc dcvoid of shalloii pyro
technics it is perfectly right for Ibis music; mellow,
rhythmic, precise and drivuig. Many a name Jau-
rock group could use someone of Billy's caliber and
taste (anyone who suffered through Iioli Mann's
interminable wa-wa-ing when Dreams was licrc \vill
know what I meant

So there it is " ii fairly open, i-asily ill‘i‘l'ss‘llill'
album by om- of the most inlciisvly [)I'r$()llill.jillt
musicians of this era. ()pi-n yourself to liiihsaiiii, and
you'll be glad you did.
