Students Take Steps Toward
Campus Ambulance Service

By John Fairhall

Would you enjoy having to wait
'35 or -l0 minutes for an ambu-
lance when you're hurt? At pres-
ent. if you are a student on
campus and need an ambulance,
you have to wait for security to
call a commerical ambulance ser-
‘ icu~the infirmary does not have
its own, To improvv this situation
and provide faster and cheaper
medical aid, :1 group of students
are working to establish “campus
en In H lary ambulance scr»

i'icr---SUNYAVAC.

The students need training and
an ambulance that they can
operate voluntarily, 24 hours a
day. So far their training is going
smoothly, but the anibulanCe will
require lots of hard-to-get dollars.
Just ten days ago the student
group of about 70 completed an
l8 hour Red Cross course that
combined Standard and Advnaced
First Aid. Taught by Marc Stern,

the course was given in a room
provided by the biology depart-
ment. During the past week stu-
dents took their practicals (pic-
tured), demonstrating on class-
room victims the various first aid
techniques.

36 Hours In Class

To qualify for ambulanCe duty
the students must next take the
New York State Department of
Health Medical Emergency Tech-
nicians course. The MET demands
36 hours of instruction and 10
hours spent in an emergency
room, as well as five dollars from
each student for books.

The course usually costs about
$2,000 but the group has dimin-
ished this figure with volunteer
help. Barry Bashkoff will act as
the senior instructor and Dr.Janet
Hood as the medical advisor; in
addition, the services of eight doc-
tors. a lawyer, and a state trooper
are required. 'l‘heAlbany Medical

Farmworker Groups Seek

Defeat of

The rights and interests of New
York state farm laborers, particu-
larly seasonal migrant workers,
may he threatened by a bill now
before both the State Assembly
and Senate An alliance of pro-
l'arm laborers' groups called
Friends of the Farm Workers is
rallying public support to ensure
the bill's defeat, The New York
State Civil Liberties Union and
the Al’L-CIO are among the
groups attacking the bill.

The bill t727-t in the Assembly
and 5666 In the Senate) is an act
to amend the labor law and pro-
vides for a farm labor board and
collective bargaining procedures
for farm employees and employ-
ersi The bill's sponsors claim it
will help the farm workers, yet
the forces opposing the bill charge
that, “The basic concepts of this
bill destroy any possibilities for
the development of a farm labor

union that might be able to allow
the farm laborer to improve his
own condition."

Despite the collectiVe bargaining
feature of the bill, critics state
that the farm workers' right to
effectively organize is restricted
One group, the Migrant Legal Ac~
tion Program, lnc., further charges
that the bill does nothing for a
special group of farmworkers-the
migrant workers. In 1970, 13,050
seasonal farm workers came into
New York State, working long
hours in a short season, leaving,
according to MLAP, little time for
union activities.

Several other criticisms are la-
beled against the hill, including
the contention that large "corpo-
rate farmers" would benefit most
from the bill The Migrant Legal
Action Program still desires legis-
lation to protect the farm worker,
but, the group states, a law that
would “allow them to organise

Bashkoff believes that an
on—campus ambulance would be
cheaper than the present system.
The inl‘irmary now pa s an ambu-
lance service $40 for a single call,
a lot of money to take an ailing
student from his dorm to either
the infirmary or a city hospital.
Bashkol'l‘ estimates a $640,000
cost to equip a vehicle for ambu-
lance servico, and the students are
seeking funds outside of the uni.
versity. Local car dealers have
been contacted as a possible
Vehicle source anti other possibili-
ties l‘or funds, or a vehicle, are
being explored.

When could service begin if the
students get their ambulancr- and

see something started by

Mandatory Student Tax
Fought By lawmaker

by Vicki Zeldin
Capitol Correspondent

Contending that “Millions of
dollars are mandated from
students and used for obscene
publications and to hire radicals
to deliver speeches at the State
University rind City Univorsity of
New York," Assemblyman Lucio
if. Russo (R-Staten Island) has
filed a hill to abolish mandatory
acitivity fees at these universities.

Russo, a twenty year veteran of
the le 'lature, claimed that he
“wants to eliminate something
that is mandatory." He contended
that students shouldn't have to
support what they don't want to,
and further stated that they
should only have to pay their
tuition and room and board. He
cited “dirty and obscene
publications" as examples of
misuse of the tax funds.

The bill, according to Russo's
bill memorandum, also claims to
“safe guard civil liberties of
students so that their
contributions are not used to
underwrite and perpetuate causes
over which they differ, without
regard to their approval or
disapproval."

Russo felt that no analogy could
be drawn between the levying of a
mandatory student tax and the
levying of state taxes. He claimed
that state taxes were necessary
and justifiable because they state
operations and provide funds for
its agencies.

The lawmaker seemed to be
unaware of the fact that the
student tax also supported
cultural and educational events,
and reiterated his statement that
students should not be forced to
pay a mandatory tax. He was
aware of the court ruling requiring
SUNY to UVWSGO the
appropriation of the activity fees,
but felt that the ruling had not
been well enforced.

The Assemblyman claimed that
the bill had "a lot of support,"
but admitted that it would be
difficult to get it out of the
Education Committee where it is
presently located He claimed that
he had received Calls from
students supporting his bill. “is
secretary mentioned that tlieybad
received numerous calls lrom
students voicing both agreement
and opposition to the bill.
