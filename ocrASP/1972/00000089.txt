The communique on the results of President
Nixon‘s talks with the leaders of China got a shrug
from Japan. west Germany welcomed the outcome
as serving the cause of peace. The Soviet Union
reserVed judgment.

So did the government of South Vietnam, but one
opposition political leader in Saigon expressed a
belief that the portion of the communique dealing
with Indochina did not reveal the depth to which
Nixon and Premier Chou En-lai carried their talks
on the subject.

A Japanese newsman reported from Hanoi that
authoritative North Vietnamese sources had told
him the communique “has nothing to do with
solving thc war in Vietnam."

Neither North Vietnam's officttils nor its media
has made any direct comment on Nixon's trip

MANCHESTER, N.H. AP -
Senator Edmund S. Muskie,
D-Maine, trudged six blocks
through a heavy snowstorm Satur-
day to appear in front of the
Manchester Union Leader ofﬁces
and call the newspaper's pub—
lisher. William Locb, a "gutlcss
coward."

Beginning a one-day campaign in
the state where he is a candidate
in the March 7 presidential pri-
mary, Muskie attacked Loeb for a
letter he reproduced and an cdi-
torial which claimed the Muskie
camp had insulted French--
Americans by use of the word
"Canuck" in Florida.

Locb, asked about Muskie's re-
marks, said the letter was authen-

tic. Loeb said Muskie's “cxeited
performance" was an attempt to
cover up “a terrible mistake" in
Florida.

Muskie told about 100 support-
ers and newsmen outside the
newspaper's ofﬁce that the can
servative publisher “has lied about
me."

“By attacking me and my wife,
he has proved himself to be a
gutICss coward," Muskie said. He
added that. he had chosen the
front of the newspaper building to
give Loeb “an opportunity, if he
has the guts, to come down."

Muskie recounted the incident
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which
was described in the letter - a tour
of a drug treatment. center.

e letter said the writer was
near Muskie when someone asked
“what did he know about black
and the problems with them H:
