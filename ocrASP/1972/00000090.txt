ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

it has become an understatement to say that Albany Sum.
students are apathetic. This apathy. however, is not limited

to this campus, but is symptomatic of a trend across [lit-
nation in which the great mass demonstrationsand political
activism of the 1960‘s has given way to the disillusionment
and resigned attitude of the present decade.

Perhaps the underlying reason for this mood cart be found
in the failure of the massiVC student efforts of the last ten
years. After a decade of what was termed “action”. the
political, economic, and social structure of the nation has
changed little. The war. the primary target of the activists,

still continues. The “defense”

establishtticnt is stronger than

it has ever been before: witness the proposed So billion

increase in war spending. The corporations still control the

economy arid our legislators still take their orders from lllu

business. Governor Rockefeller's recent appointments to the

University Council show that wealthy, influential interests

still control the university. and not. as it may be prcstiiiictl.

the taxpayers and students. The great imbalance of ltri\\'t'l'

and wealth still exists. and the rtittcli discussed "little man"

is being hurt rttorc anti more by the big capitalists llill .i

government which is unresponsive to his needs.

The (iL‘llltlllSEl‘JHllillS

arid actions may il.l\t‘ hail

psychological appeal to the participants, and may h.i\i-

conveyed the impression that a sizeable sector of [ilk

population was against the war and iii favor ot |tt’\\

priorities and “power to the people"

liut they lilllt‘ll in

their major goals: America is still a country Ulllll'ltlll'il hi

the few. and primarily for their owtt personal benefit.

We place the blame for the

failure ofactivism on .i latk oi

leadership and know-how within the movement. (fot'poratc

state America is too well-organized. it is ntonstrotisli

overwhelming and the students' efforts to change it were

pitiful. America‘s ruling class cannot be ititiitiidatcd by the

chanting and matching of students.

As We see it, there are two major courses of iltlliili open

for the students. We can either “give up“ arid dedicate our

efforts to the satisfying of personal desires and needs and

look forward to the day when the older generation divs off.

Or we could return to activism.

if you are willing to wait for change. you Would follow tlit'

first option. if, however, you desire immediate change. We

have several recom titendat ions.

It is necessary that we organize and learn thc \vais of

power. We must learn exactly where the levers of power arc

and how to control this power. We must educate oi..st-lii 
and take .ill we cart front the system.

tried to rid themselves of Rep.
Ashbrook. He has been gerry-
mandered twice, but escaped un-
scathed in both cases.) Ae-
eording to liberal columnists
Rowland Evans and Robert
Novak, Mr. Nixon desptttched
Vice-President Agnew to dissuade
Willittm F. Buckley from sup-
porting Ashbrook. in the same
vein, John Mitchell, up to the
last minute, implored John
Ashbrook not to run, And when
LE. Thomas, Republican State
GOP Chairman, predicted that
Ashbrook would receive 25% in
that state's primary, he was
quickly brought into line and is
now predicting an Ashbroth dis-
aster.

So much for the Ashbrook
campaign. What about Ashbrook
himself'.’ Although largely un‘
known to the general public, the
.ill year-old Congressman has
long been kttowti arid rt-spceli-(l
among the nation‘s conservative
community. A poll of conserva-
lives conducted in 1969 ranked
Ashbrook behind oiin
Goldwater, Reagan, 'l‘owvr and
Bill Buckley iii their respect.
While the Ohio Al"L-Cl() hits
termed him “it Neanderthal,
mos-shack reactionary", others
have described ltittt as ‘zin at»
lr: ~1ch and militant cons"-
itilin-,"aritl one of “the world's
most charming, intelligent and

   

natural men..."

In l956, at the age of 28. he
was elected to the sttttelegisltr
ture rind also to the post of GOP
County Chairman. Meanwhile in
1954 he was elected president of
the YR organization, and one
year later became the first dluir-
man of the Young Republican
National Federation to be elec-
ted without opposition. In 1960
be defeated incumbent. Robert
Levering and began his eongresv
sional career.

in the House, Ashbrook com-
piled tt solidly conservative record
and until recently served as chair-
man of the American Conservative
Union. Early in the Nixon admini-
stration, Ashbrook‘s disenchant-

ment. began, and soon he was
challenging one Nixon program
after another, but his formal

break with the President did not
come until last December, Said
Ashbrook, “I am not one of those
who ‘:aii Vli'W with alarm' under
K cnnedy and Johnson, then
‘point with pride' when the samiI
policies lil‘l' advanced by a Repub-
lican President. In time some cir<
cums-latices may change, but basic
principles rcntain the same." And
that fact that John Ashbrook
holds fast to his principles, no
mattcr what the cost, earns him
respect from even those who hold
diflt ring.r viewpoints

The important thing is not to be
individualistic or even to rely on
just a small group of supporters;
isolated individuals are never
strong enough. As Chairman
