Admission to Albany State will
be slightly tougher next year, but
on the whole, the requirements
will remain similar to those of the
past.

Dr. Rodney A. Hart, Director of
Admissions, said that he is waiting
for the quotas of the numbers of
freshman, transfer, and EOP
students. The quotas, expected to

come in soon, are determined by
Vice President Sirotkin according
to room space and limitations of
specific departmental majors such
as Medical Technology,
Psychology, and the Social
Sciences. Hart estimated that over
10,000 students applied this,year,
a slight increase over the 9,300
students who applied last year.
Hart also expects more
competition among the transfer

and EOP students since
approximately 1,300 applied this
year as compared to 550 last year.

4000 Fresh men

As of now, Hart said that he is
moving with the A (90+) students,
holding with the B+ (87-89)
student and discarding the B-
(85-) group. He hopes that he can
accept 4,000 freshmen this year
and perhaps an additional 50 to

Albany, high school average and
Regents average are the main
admissions criteria, and thi-
largely by Regents Scholarship Exam is used
with a as "a good way to screen all
applicants." Hart also said that he
doesn't like “judging a student on
a one day performance," but
rather uses the RSE as a
comparison to the high school
average and Regents average. The
college boards are disregarded
except in the event of an

the new accelerated degree
program which allows the student
to finish his undergraduate work
in 3 years.

such as music and athletics. Other

Illusion of Competition

There has been quite a changi- Ill
the competition for admission.
This year, the deadline for
applications was moved up to
January 15; however, there is a
lower percentage of students who
accept, in contrast to 5 years ago.
This may be part of a great
illusion about the competition at
Albany State.

There will be only a slight
increase in thr- enrollment next
year. On the one hand, SUNYA is
losing students to private
universities, showing l.Ilt' Sllt‘t't'ss
(if Uieohjectives of the increased
tuition and board rules; some
students are also applying to other
universities centers I"tir example.
llart said thl Wl‘ split the number
of students accepted here and at
Binghamton about evonly. On the
other band, due to the increased
quality of education at SUNYA
and to its increasing popularity,
many good applications are
l‘l'Ct'in'd. According to Hart, “the
(2 student doesn't bother to apply
anymore," Still, l-lart said, there is
no truth to the myth that you
nt'l'tl at least. a 90 average to br-
acccpted. llai'l hopes lllill he can
continue accepting the student
with the 87+ and comparable lieg-
ents average.

Trend Toward Regionalism

 

There is now, according to Ilarl,
a trend toward regionalism in or
der to loosen the competition for
those living within the surround-
ing 50 mile radius from the
school. This separates the appli-
cants into two main groups :the
local Vs. the rest of the state. This
trend also came about in case of a
housing problem, however, such a
problem does not exist at the
present time. Four years ago all
freshmen were required to live on
campus. Now. many of them livv
off campus, one reason may be
the increase in room and board.
llnwr-ver, in case there is a lack of
morning facilities, those within
the 50 mile radius would he re
