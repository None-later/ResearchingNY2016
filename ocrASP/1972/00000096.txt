on December 13th, that a similar
situation occurred at Plattaburgh
in the fall of 1971, and that “the
Central Staff earlier this year in-
structed the campus administra-
tion at Plattaburgh to refund the
money...". Lampert never re-
ceived a reply.

A second, shorter letter was sent
to Boyer on Fevruary 22 asking
not only for the refund, but for a
five percent interest fee “for the
six months the Bursar has had our
first semester money". This re-
quest has not received an answer
yet either.

Hartley, meanwhile, claims that
his actions were “perfectly in line
with what the board of trustees
said". “With the current fiscal
crises we are in,"’Hartley claims,
we can't afford to pick up on the
subsidy.“ He claims that he has
written a letter to Spindlcr
arguing that his position “is per-
fectly defensible" and that “ther
is no reason to refund the mon-
eyli.

So, the Central Administration
finds itself caught between two
opposing forces---the student gov-

ernment and the local administra-
tion. It appears word will be
coming soon; 1"“ William Anslow
of Central Administration claimed
that Spinuler has prepared a reply
tor the Chancellor and that it is
being reviewed. He refuses to
comment on its contents until
Boyer signs it and Lampert re-
ceives it.

Anslow also states that the only
reason other SUNY campuses did
not follow Albany’s lead ﬁnd drop
the subsidy was because the insti-
tution of the wage-price freeze
made this impossible. He claims
they "would have followed suit"
were it not for that freeze. It was
Albany‘s early billing procedure
and the fact that some (though
not alll‘rgom bills were sent out
in late July that caused SUNYA
to ESCRPE the freeze---and hence,
drop the subsidy.

But uniformity will soon he
achieved. Initial guidelines have
been modified; besides hiking
room rates, and boosting tuition
last week, SUNY trustees took a
further action-«they dropped the
phone subsidy. Statewide.

"Every Chil

by Glenn von Nostitz

l D“. Janet Hood, Director of the
Student Health Service, told a
gathering of women's liberation-
ists Tuesday night that, “When
ever children are unwanted by
loving parents, abortion may be
the lesser of two evils. There is
nothing else that can be said in
favor of it." The remarks were
made in an impromptu speech to
about thirty members of the
SUNYA Women's Liberation Cau-

cus.
The speech prompted ii rather

hostile rcsponsc from various
members of lhe audience during
a later question and answer

period. During the speech, Hood
asked her audience, "What are
you sccking to be liberated
from?" and went on to refute
many if the liberationisls' most
sacred tenets. Shc maintains that
females “are a sex object only if
you want to be a sex object." She
feels that females have as equal a
chance to do anything they want
as males, and perhaps a more
equal chance, claiming that it is
actually easier for women to get
into medical schools than men.
Hood characterizes herself as a
"liberated" woman, in that she
does whatever she wants to do.
She was one of three females

that many women are “simply not
interested" in the professions, she
says that she “is the only one"
who is still utilizing here medical
knowledge in a job. Furthermore,
she cites the fact that there are 75
women doctors in the Capital
Dixtrict who are no longer active
in their field, and says that this is
one of the reasons there are so
few women professionals.
“They'd rather play golf", com-
ments Hood, and she feels that
“this is not a good commentary
on women in this field."

The health service chief drew a
strongly negative reaction when
she said that “females can do
everything they want to do" and
that most females do not compete
"fair and square" with men be-
cause they pose more of a risk to
employers. Males, she claims, are
often stcadier workers because
they “are not out with the cramps
every 28 days," and that because
of this, employers are entirely
justified in hiring males over fe-
males. She wrapped up her
remarks on women's liberation
saying that males and females
have to compete evenly, and that
females should not be giVen
special treatment.

Main Focus is Prevention

admitted to he? Class i"- Ya'" speech, howeVer, centered around

area of “conception prevention' :i
term Hood uses because “it is
more accurate than birth con
trol."

Hood claims that she has been In
the forefront of the movement in
provide better conception control
facilities, and that she was in illl‘
fight “when conception control
was a taboo subject." She feels
that “every child should IN‘

havu seen enough unwanted (’IIII
dren.“ Hood‘s pcrsonal pliilo
sopliy on the subjccl is that “llit'
decision to bear a child should l)|'
that of the woman involved."

Dr. Hood listed the spccifii' Hl‘l'
vices presently being offi-rcd .ii
health service. Most importanl ol
these is information. The St'l'Yli‘t'
offers students information on
conception prevention and the

about any problems they may
have. lined claims that she has
talked many hours with sludcnis.
and has also gchn spccclics to
groups throughout the campus

The health service also giii-~.
appropriate referral when
tion or “birth control“ is sought.
but Hood stresses that the St'l’Vii‘I'
does not distribute “ihi- pill" Slit-
says that the health service also
“does pregnancy screening" and
they assist students who are pn-g
nant out of wedlock. Last year.
she says, the health service (ll'illl

Dr. Hood says that the hcnlili

that the health service does no! do
the calling itself.
