In an interview in last Tuesday's ASP, Peter Htilev,

an ASP editorial concerning Food Service's administrative

and the ASP welcomes his comments. It is unfortunate,
though, that Mr. Haley neither denied nor conceded several

N.Y. Red Squad Suppresses Dissent

Courtesy of Liberation News Service - 

In New York they call them-
selves the Security rind Investiga-
tion Section; in other cities they
go by the name of the Anti-Sub-
versive Squad, the Intelligence
Unit, the Civil Disobedience Unit
or other aliases. Most evorybody
-tills them the Red Squad.

If you’ve ever been to tiny
demonstration you‘ve seen them
there—straightdressed middle-
tiged men knowingly eyeing every-
one or trading slightly meniieiiig
quips with people they‘ve st't'l]
Iii-fore. 'l‘heii llH'I'l' are their not‘
sir-conspicuous t'roiiit-s who some-
llllll‘s manage to look and dress
like everyone else or those who
eiirry hiki- pr passes iiiirl i'titiie-
ms with it TV station's initials on
it

They extst in some form in
M -r_\' large or lnt'(lllllt1'hl7.i'il urbiiii

huge intelligence network that in-
eludes 20 federal agencies site“ as
t e . B , '.r" y .n'e.l g,ii.i- ..t
h S-e.el Servire. The network
and the paranoia stalking along
with it are throwing so rapidly that
pretty soon people are going to
think that there is tin agent behind
every iiitiilliox (the Post Office in
fuel has an intelligence division of
its woiii.

Recently it group of New York
people including three people who
were making a film on the Red
Squad, l’litiiliet‘s, ii lawyer, Abbie
Hoffman, iiieitiliers of Computer
People for Peace, iind ti iiit'liibt-r

 

 

 

of the Gay Liberation Front. filed
suil. against; the NY. Red Squad
to stop it from further infiltration
interrogation, electronic surveil-
lance and the use of informers.

In recent years, the NY. Red
Squad (or BOSS-the Bureau of
Special Services—its it used to be
called) has liiid quite an active
career. According to it number of
people who havo watched it (and
have been watched by it) since the
sixties, its tactics since that time
have changed. “At the beginning
of the Petiee movement in lilliH. ll
wtis the shock troops til' the
cops." They used kzirali- lllltl brass
knuckles and “heal the shit out of
people." They woitltl (ll'lVi' down
the street and pick it key point in
a deiiiiiiislriilioii, divu iii and split
llll‘ tli-riioiistrtitioii into smaller
parts.

Gradually over the years their
tactics have switched to cameras
and some of the agents have In“
come almost celebrities. Probably
the most famous example is- John
Finnegan—ii sliek, silver-haired
Red Squad miiii who has become
so prominent tit deiiionstritlions
that many New Yorkers recognize
him and swap comments. Finne‘
gait, when not. on official business,
can be found moonlighting as it
male model. He once appeared in
an ad for the Chemical Batik with
the caption, “What, an inter»
iitiiiotizil banker with unlimited
Vision can do for it business willi
unlimited potential." But li‘inn-

ogan is l] diversion.

BOSS 'is considered low-key
compared to the much more ag-
gressive anti tough Chicago Red
Squad for example. Bill the fact is
the files in their inconspicuous
Hudson St. office include dossiers
on an estimated 250,000 people
in New York riglil now, The
city' . :id includes 200250 overt
agents who go to piihlie activities
like demonstrations (not counting
itiforiiit-rs and uiidi-renver agents
who infiltrate organizations).
'I'ht-ir budget is estimated at about
$3 million,

In No“ York, BOSS is an elite

i-oips, lliiil according to (Illl‘ till‘

 

\t‘l'yi'l', “eons iirt- tearing down the

BOSS' reputation for infiltrating
organizations in New York is well
known, The organization Wilt; us-
ing inl‘iltrtiters (Red Squad people
who iire spec'illy trained to iiifil
trale an organization) long livfoie
the FBI who were only relying on
informers (people who “t'l'i' part

In the case of the Family Trust
(six people who were caught late
in 1970, about to firebomb n
bunk) BOSS wiretapped phones,
bugged rooms and cars, and used
body mikes too. The agent
assigned in the Family was chosen
for his i-vperience dealing with
(‘Xl)l()S|V|.~.

BUSH has tried it great variety of
Itit'lliiit’lﬁ'ill‘ﬂl iirc the first ones to
admit it. They responded to the
anti-BOSS suit with an affidavit of
their own ithey were required to)
by defining their i'lt‘liVlllt‘S"'tl'1(l it
was an amazingly l'rtiiik response.
Because of the increase of radii
.it‘livites dtiriiig the 60's BOSS
stud, they increased the number of
“undercover operators employed
by the iiiiil and the close surveil-
lance of activities of groups"
which because of "their conduct
or rlii-lorie may pose ti threat to
life, property or govvrnmeiitiil tid-
ministration.“

The function of the Intelligence
division (of which BOSS is the
most important piirt) is in general

 

"I. does mitten
on di-Oﬂun."

 

to “initiate investigations of the
activities and associations of those
persons and groups to discover
evidence of their illegal activities.”
BOSS is also the central section of
the Police Department which han'
dies till the bugging and surveil-
lance equipment. The other sec-
tions of the Department must
okay use of the equipment with
them, which means if you have a
political record your other activi-
ties are. bound to be under closer
scrutiny.

BOSS freely admits iii the til'fi'
dlIVil. to methods ranging from
wiretapping to electronic eaves
dropping to wiring of people to
photography to inl'iltriitors. This
is all to “secure information i'eliit
ing to the activities of any person
or group which is liker to result
iii ii crime or a serious police
problem"

The Big City
To the Editor:

llopi-fully ltoli Mayer's eon-
.s'i'ioustiess Wits not too severely
jolted by the shock of the big city
on his trip home (memory can
pliiy ftiiiiiy tricks on ii hotly, liiili
llrili‘fi. Still, it might liiiVe llt'l'li
better if he had waited iiiilil he
had calmed down to write his
iirllt'le.

New York is in u desperate mid
ugly condition, but it is ll eoiith-
iioii siiiirt-il by most other Ameri
can elites, iiiitl it is only destined
for doom il' Wi' tippriiiieh il with
llll' type of ltli'li)(ll'ililli|llt‘ self
righteousness which your reporter
indulges iii.

II‘ New Yorkers are preoccupied
wttli Survrviil. it is it tribute to
llll'lll lhiii they pl'l‘Nlﬁl so slitli
bornly If indeed they buried
themselves, they lliIVi' li-iiriied
enough not to Wtiil for anyone
else to dig them out. \Ilt‘lllt‘t‘ it i.\‘
out of necessity or not, they hiive
liiirdi-iii-d iiloiig Willi the i-ity, and
are possibly the most iitliiiiriilily
selfi'eliiilii aggregate of men and
women in this nation. In it time
when iill polities are the pttlllit‘h of
lriislriitioii, they are New York’s
best lllllN' I suspect Mr. Mayor
was away too long.

Sincerely,
