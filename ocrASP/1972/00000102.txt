I the best of League I, the
Prophets, played the best of
League [1, the Liberators, in the
commissioner‘s tournament. The
Prophets won out 49-47.

High scorers for the Prophets
were Bradley Biggs with 19 pts.
and Andy Toutman with 13 pts.
while high scorer for the losing
Liberators was Ross with 12 pts.
It was Ross whose last second
jumper gave the Liberators an
upset victory over APA in the
semi-finals the previous night.

Al’A was favored in that game as
it was a League I team which was
looking for another shot iit the
League 1 champs, the Prophets.
Also that evening, the Prophets
easily beat the Zoomers to go into
the ﬁnals.

Buoyed from their last second
victory the night before, the ori-
derdoﬂ Liberators started off fast
with 6 quick points. It seemed to

Enter SUNY Champs

by Alan D. Abbey

Well the men of the basketball team aren't going
anywhere after their season ends tonight, but the
Albany Women's Basketball team is.

Even though they finished the season with only a
5-5 record, the members of the women's basketball
team are going to the State tourney, being held at
Oneonta this weekend, by virtue of their victory
over New Pally. last week. Not all the women's
teams in the SUNY conference are going so this is
no small accomplishment.

Barbara l’alm the ('(lll(‘l1 of the women‘s team, is
very pleased with the way the team has been
performing this year, and pleasantly surprisnrl.
“Nine of the twelve women were inexperienced
before this year," she declared. She praised the
entire team, but singled out freshman 'l‘ara Vander
Vere. "If she plays for four years, she'll tear out all
the records." said Palm.

The Women's swim team is also going to have a
busy post-season, as two of their number are going
to the SUNYAC Champs at l“redonia this
weekend.

Dollack

mgsn't Mgttgr But

By Lloyd Fishman

The stigma that Albany cannot
win on the road was shattered
Vednesday night as the Danes
defeated Cortland 75-73. The fact
that the Sauersmen were ineligible
for a bid, was somewhat evident,
as their playing was erratic.

The Danes got off to a slow
start, making numerous mistakes
and were down 16-10. The fact
that John Quattrocchi picked up
three quick personals didn’t help
either. Bob Rossi (18 pts.) and
Reggie Smith (15 pts.) then took
charge, and put on an 8 point
spurt at the end of the half to
forge Albany into a 40-29 half—
time lead. The latter part of the
ﬁrst half looked like the Albany
of old, as they were hitting their
shots and making crisp passes.

1n the second half, the Danes
looked as if they were still in the
locker room. With only two mi-
nutes gone, Quattrocchi picked up
his fifth personal, and soon after,
Dave Welchons got his fourth.
With its team leaders on the
bench, things looked hopeless.

 

 

Danes Edge Cortlan

However, Tony Tedesco came to
the rescue. Tedesco, a little used
guard most of the year, hustled at
both ends of the court, and dis-
played fine defense, contributing
eleven points to the cause, all in
the second half. He and Harry
Johnson helped give Albany nine
straight points, and a 64-53 lead,-
after Cortland closed within two.

Cortland, however, never gave
up. Beating Albany inside and off
the boards, they forced the Danes
to go into a 2-1-2 zone. The Red
Dragons closed to within one,
with 2 57 left in the game, and
Bob Antin put them into the lead
at 1249, with two free throws,, as
Welchons fouled out. Sixteen sec-
onds later, Reggie Smith hit Bob
Curtis under the basket for a three
point play. Cortland tied it up a
half minute later, and the excite-
ment was about to begin.

Albany then went into a minute
long stall, and with 5 seconds left
in the game, Rossi hit a 20-foot
jumper, reminiscent of the game
against Hartwick.

After calling time out, Cortland

 

put the ball in play with 5 seconds |
remaining. As the buzzer went
off, Antin sunk a 20 footer. The
official ruled no basket, to the
distaste of fans and players. De-
spite obscenities by Antin, the
decision stood and Albany walked
out with their victory.

Abbey Road

   
 

Off The NCAA!

Alan D. Abbey

 

'l‘he outrage has been done, and all appeals have
been exhausted, but the anger remains.

Because of a small oversight on the part of the
Athletic Department, which was made only because
the NCAA didn't bother to let its constituents know
of an interpretation of an unfair rule, the Great
Danes end their season tonight against Marist, and
not in Southhampton or Evansville (the sites for the
NCAA College Division Championships).

The actions of the NCAA should be deplored and
condemned by all. Not only is the prediction rule
unfair in itself, but to not let its constituents know
of an interpretation of the ineligibility rule is the
worst horror of them all. For too long the life of
every college athlete in the nation has been held in
the arthritic sweaty palms of the NCAA.

The time has come. The NCAA must be made to
realize that no longer will such heavy handed,
autocratic decisions, made in the confines of small,
smoky rooms, be allowed. The people affected by
the NCAA's ruling must soon realize that they are
having their life's blood sucked from them.

The NCAA does not care about them. The NCAA
does not want to know from the appeals ofa small
University tucked up in lhe boondocks of New
York State. They are out only for power and
money. Power of the worst sort. They are out for
the power of yes and no, life and death. The power
to deny a team of its rightful place in a post-season
tournament. Only sick men could want such power.

The Albany Phys. Ed. Department did nothing
wrong. They are guilty only on a technicality. The

NCAA must be pleased to no end. Their power rests
in their love of the technicality, the beauty (to
them) of bureaucracy, the tangle of rule within rule,
and the maze of interpretation after interpretation.

The real victims in this deal are the players on the
Great Dane basketball team, and the students of
Albany State. Coach Richard Suuers has now had
the postseason rug swept from under him for two
straight years.

This cannot go on.
