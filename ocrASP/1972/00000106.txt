Two bills aimed at putting an end to what was
termed as widespread abuses in the State‘s pensioni
system have been introduced in the Assembly.

The bills directed at the practice of rehiring retired
top State officials at salaries exceeding their salary
prior to retirement have been introduced by
Schenectady Assemblyman Clark Wcmplc and
Hobart Assemblyman Edwyii Mason.

One bill would provide that any person retired
from state employment receiving retirement bene-
fits in excess of $5,000. who is then rehired by the
State in any capacity would forfeit his pension
benefits until such time as the forfeited benefits
equal the amount received for thc post-retirement
work. The other measure would limit State pensions
to a maximum of $15,000.

The legislators gave sevcral cxamplcs of men
currently riding on the pension gravy train. Among
them was SUNYA (lSl’A l’rofcssor Donald Axclrod.

sum from the State coffers.

Mason, speaking on the Axelrod situationsaid,

“...he ought to be ashamed of himself..." Addressing
himself to the entire pension issue, he stated, "This

dirty business is too wide spread." He also claimed
that the bills were aimed at the top salar makers

FSA Student Workers Shore Grievances

by Stephen Flavin

Answering the call to col-
lectively discuss grievances and
seek amends, over 100 FSA stu-
dent workers packed into the
Fireside Lounge last Wednesday
evening.

Representatives of every food
unit found that besides sharing a
common employer and similar
working conditions, many stu'
dents are unfortunately sharing
similar grievances. in a general rap
session, grievances voiced include:

I’uy— Food Service has never
made public i
minimum-maximum pay range for
work done anti time in service.
“My suite mate and I signed on to
work for food service in our fresh-
man ycar," one girl explained. “1
had the courage to ask for a raise
last ycar and my friend didn't. I
get more liioncy for doing the
same work than my litiicd friend .
ls this I" '

Another student noted that
llircc years ago he got $l,(it) per
hour. He was promised a $.05 to a
$.10 raisc per semester worked. [it
|‘.l7(l he finally got thc $|.85
minimum wage. but “has rcccivcd
nothing cxtra since." Workers
voiccd assent on a plan calling for
merit in.rcascs and the possibility
of a $2.00 per hour starting wage
was proposed.

llours— Seemingly. as ot'tcn as
raises are promised, so are hours.
Seemingly. as often as student

raises come through, so do “prom-
ised” hours. Student workers, as
human beings, would like advance
notice on changes or cuts in work-
ing hours since it is the student
workers who will be affected in
time committments and in the
paycheck.

Seniority—Last summer, every
student worker was arbitrarily
“laid off" on Colonial Quad.
Some of the student workers had
nevor worked for Food Service,
others had for years. All were
“promised hours.” Though many
were hired back at vastly de-
creased hours, newcomers Were
included. faithful student workers
shunted aside.

Dress Code— Though the cam-
pus center may liave favorably
resolved the “women must wear ii
pinafore dress" rule in favor of
the women, policy should be uni-

Mcalpoliey- All deductions
should be noted on the paycheck;
all deductions of hours worked
should be explained. Before any
deductions are made, consent. of
the employee should be sought.
Alternative solutions agreeable to
Food Service and the student wor-
kers should be published.
form on the Quads also.

FSA Hierarchy— A "Who's
Who" in FSA with job descrip-
tions and duties should be made

public and presented to each stu-

dent when he signs on to work.
Students should know to whom
to go if they have complaints.

Making use of the large turn-out,
volunteers were solicited from
each food unit to serve on Ad Hoc
committees.

A research committee is being
organized to investigate FSA and
its Borad of Directors. Labor
Laws, legal implications, and to
seek legal advice.
ers a constitution committee Is
drawing up ii constitution to pre-
sent to the student workers for
ratification hopefully, within two
weeks.

To collect grievances from all
the food units and to look for
discrepancies, a “grievance com-
mittee" is being formed. The
grievance committee will investi-
gate the charges made at the
meeting as well as other worker
complaints.

A publicity committee is organi-
zing to insure an information flow
between food units, to announce
meetings and to issue press re-
leases.

To be recognized as the legiti-
mate representatives of the works

The ASP will run announce-
ments on future meetings of
workers (in graffiti). For further

“Surprise” State Health Department
Food Facility Cliecks Known in Advance

by Eddy 'i‘rink

According to informed sources,
“surprise” food facility inspec-
tions by the Statc llcallh Depart-
mcnt are known before they hap-
pen on at least one of tlic qtiads
here on the State University of
New York at Albany. It was
learned that mice the inspection is
known to be coming, the facilities
at this particular qiiad's kitchen
are altered so that the inspection
will result in a good rating for that
part iculal' quad.

'l'hcsc facts wcrc lcai'iicd in
light of a tclcphonc iiitcrricw with
Ralph Adams of the State llcalth
Department. Adams stach that.
"Under normal conditions, the
operator or iiianagcr of thc facil-
ity (food) docs not know llll‘
inspection is coliiiiig iintil it oc~
curs." Adams added that coin-
plctc food futility inspections are
iindcrtaltcn twice a ycai' whilc
complaints arc aiiswcrcd all year
round. It was also discovcrcd that
thc Regional Office ol' the State
Health Department (alias the De-

partmcnl of Sanitation). located
in one of the State Office Build-
ings right next door to this camp-
us, handles all inspcctiiins in this
area. l'lowcvcr. all three Stiitc lil-
spcclors (or Saiiitiirians as they
are callcd by Adams) were lin-
availahlc for comment as of last
Friday.

This rcporlcr tlicn sought out
stalclncnts by kitchcn pci'soncl of
Dutch, Colonial. and State Quads.
l’crsons Wci'c asked how oftcli tlic
State Health llcpiirtmcnt inspects
thcir facilities atid all were asked
if they kncw of any previous
inspection bcl'orc it occurred. in a
telephone interview, an iiiiidciil-
il‘icd source on l)l|l('li Quad said
that inspections ltlkl‘ placc llircc
tinics a year, bill when asked
about knowing of coming inspec-
lions rciiiarkcd that, "Shc'll (tlic
iiispi-ctori l)c coining again in
May. Aiiothcr uiiitlciitil'icd source
on (Tiiloiiial Quad statcd that ill-
spcct ions soiiictimcs occur “twicc
a Week or twice a month," htil
affirmed that “We iicycr know
when they (the inspector) are

going to pop in." One of the chefs
of State Quad, however, gavc an
entirely different view of the sil-
tuitioii. He said that inspections
occur twice a ycar and that "Wc
know when they are coming be-
l'orcliiilid—hnt not thc time or

day," Apparently. he meant tluit
he knows the general time of year
whcn the inspection is to take
place, but no specific time or day.
However, hc ciiipliiisizcd that “We
are prepared all the lime." nican-
ingIthnt he keeps his kitchcn in
excellent condition evcry day of
the year.

 

The chef so addcd sonic coin-
ments on stories precioust writv
lcii about food scrvicc on his
quad. llc said that articles about
his kitchen. “doesn't hotlicr inc"
aiitl maintained that there are no
"roaches ill his kitchen." llc ex-
plained that any cockroaches
found in his kitchen “conic front
tiic town-r tl'lastiiiani'I whcrc stu—
dents attract them with dogs and
by cooking With inadcquatc facili—
ties."

FSA itself, on the other hand,

knows nothing about State Health
inspections. The secretary for
Peter llalcy, Assistant to the Dir-
cctor of Food Service, told this
reporter to ‘all Ilichard Finke‘s
office (the Assistant Director of
the Commissary) and inquire a-
bout inspections. Finke's office
suggested calling the chefs on each
quad, asking them about food
inspections.

If indeed kitchen personel on
the different quads are told or
tipped off about coming State
Health Department inspections
before they occur, then it seems
the whole purpose of unannou-
nced inspections is defeated. Any
inferior conditions in cafeterias on
the campus will not be discovered.
but will pose a possible, though
rciiiote. hazard to student health.
llchvcr, an investigation into
who tips off ccrliiin lt‘SA eni-
ployecs about coming inspections
is beyond this reporter and should
be instituted by reliable admini-
strators of this University.
