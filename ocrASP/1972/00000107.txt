HARRISBURG. P8. (AP) — FBl informer Boyd F.
Douglas Jr. says antiwar priest Philip Berrigan
agreed with him that a plan to kidnap Henry A.
Kissinger couldn't be accomplished without a gun
and suggested “we should use blanks instead of
loaded bullets."

"I told Philip Berrigan l was sure I could obtain ii
gun to rise in the kidnapping if it was requested of
me," the government's chief witness testified Friday
before the conspiracy trial of llerrigan and six
others recessed for the weekend. He quoted Berri-
gan as describing the kidnap scheme, allegedly
outlined in a letter from another dcfciidant as
“brilliant” but acknowledging it “opens the door to
murder."

Douglas, on thc stand for the prosecution for the
fifth day, said the priest proposed that the Kissinger
plan “be carried out after thc destruction" of
tunnels that carry liciit to federal buildings in
Washiiiglori. l),(). v a projccl the witness insisted
was licrrigan's prime inlcrcst.

out! Amnesty "mi

WASHINGTON (AP)- Robert C.
Ransom and Martin Kelly lost
sons in the Vietnam War.

Ransom strongly supports am-
nesty now for draft resisters and
Kelly vehemently oppoaes the
idea.

Their conflicting testimony last
week before a Judiciary subcom-
mittee headed by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., reﬂects the
deep division on the issue.

Following are excerpts from
their testimony.

From Ransom, a New York cor-
poration lawyer:

If I were to be granted the
power to influence this Com-
mittee's thinking on only one very
narrow point. it would be this:

I would like to be able to dispel
forever that popular and prevalent
misconception that it would dis-
honor the nearly 56,000
Americans who have (lied in Viet-
nam to grant amnesty now to
these many (if our children who
have opposed participation in the
war by one means or another.

Through our own most personal
tragedy we can view the Vietnam
war with a perspective that is
simply not available to the rest of
you. From the anguish that we
and our sons endured as we came
to grips with the grim realities of
Vietnam, we can perhaps uniquely
comprehend what has gone on
within the minds and consciences
of those who have left the
country, who have deserted, or

who have gone to jail.

In our case, our oldest son died

Two Fathers Speak

States was doing in Southeist Asia
that he very nearly did not board
the plane that was to take him
there.

The alternative, of course, was
six years in jail.

When Mike died, we had two
other sons already subject to the
Selective Service System. with
three others following along close-
ly. I determined then that I would
become as expert as possible in
the intricacies of that system.

i became appalled at how little
sound, legal advice there actually
was available to our young men,
in spite of the fact that Selective
Service statutes and regulations
have always constituted a clearly
defined body of law, readily avail-
able to the legal profession as a
source of additional practice.

I find it little wonder that, left
largely to their own resources,
large numbers of them began to
seek alternatives. Some men have
chosen to face the federal court
system. and go to jail for their
convictions.

Others have elected to leave the
country, mostly going to Canada.

To have consulted their boards
was virtually hopeless.

i would submit that the unten-
able position into which we
forced these young men is re.
sponsible for their predicament
today. These are our sons, and we
need them back. They did not
deserve what we have done m
them.

Kelly. an investigator for the
Massachusetts Dept. of Insurance,
referred at various times in his
testimony to Democratic Sens.

George McGovern of South 1)“.
kota, Philip A. Hart of Michigan
and J.W. Fulbright of Arkansas.

From Kelly:

1 did lose a son in 1968, whose
name was Daniel Kelly. He was it
member of the 1st Cavalry Air.
Mobile killed in the Asliua Valley
and as of this moment is still in
the Ashua Valley.

Combat troops generally in 3
war, particularly in Vietnam, can
expect and do get ambushed and
do get betrayed. But the moment
before that ambush, they are
alive, armed, and could have at
least attempted to defend them
selves.

However, courageous political
leaders are expert in the tactics at
ambush, because after all, men
who kill in action can't hear those
words that try to destroy a repu-
tation, that attempt to destroy
the memories of honorable and
dedicated men.

It is difficult for me to stand
and look and know why someone
would suggest total bliiiikct am»

l have not suggested that. 1 am
against the proposal lliat Si-n
llart mentioned sonic liiiic ago.
which was conditional amnesty

But I do riot feel lliat this

Air Disaster in Albany

AP Compilation
Clark and Mayer

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The pilot
of a Mohawk Airlines turboprop
that crashed into an Albany home
and took 17 lives Friday night
apparently knew he would not
make. it to the Albany County
Airport runway.

by Sinclair

A spokesman for an ll-man
team of federal investigators said
Saturday that Capt. Robert
McAdams. 44, of Southampton,
N.Y.. “said he would land short of
the runway and he feathered one
engine."

Beyond that, Brad Dunbar. de-
puty director of the National
Transportation Safety Board,
would not speculate about a cause
of the fully loaded New York-to-
Albany flight's troubles.

The Washington-based probe
team, headed by George R, Baker,
was shifting through evidence at
the middle-class neighborhood
crash site and its temporary head-
quarters at a motel a mile away.

When McAdams radioed the
Albany tower at 8:47 p.m. that
one engine was in trouble about
five miles from the landing field in
suburban Colonie and due south
of the runway, air controllers
called crash trucks onto the run-
way.

But at 8:48 p.m., when
McAdams radioed he had cut the
engines and the tower lost con-
tact, controllers notified State Po-
lice and the crash vehicles raced
off the runway through a side gate
and headed south the three miles
to the then-speared 50 Edgewood
Ave.

A light snow was falling. Visibi-
lity was 1,200 feet. Controllers
say conditions and equipment
were normal for the instrument
landing.

Less than it) minutes later. a
controller told a newsman, the
missing craft was Flight 405 from
La (hiardia Airport. "FUI'ly'llll't't'

Hospital personnel banned press
contacts with passengers, so it was
not known whether McAdams had
told the passengers of their plight
before shutting off the electricity
as he guided the aircraft down
from 2,100 feet.

On sunny Saturday afternoon,

hundreds of the curious pressed .

against police barricades, and the
stifling smell of kerosene perme-
ated the chill air as the investiga-
tors pickcd apart the flattened
plane.

From his wheelchair at Albany
Medical Center Hospital, thc
house's owner related that he had
not been concerned his home was
in ii flight path. but “now i would
be a little gun-shy."

J. Robert Sheehan, who lives
across the street from the ltosens.
was taking out the garbage when
he heard the plane overhead.

“l‘m kind of a plane buff,"
Sheehiin said, "and i could tell it
was a turboprop in trouble. I
looked up and the plane was
tipped to the left and the tail was
down. Then i saw it go over the

tail of a Mohawk Airlines turbo-prop protrudes from the front of
contractor Joseph Rosen’s home while the cockpit section rests in the
back yard after the aircraft crashed while attempting an emergency
landing at Albany Friday night. 0f the 48 persons aboard, 16 were
killed. Rosen and his family suffered only minor injuries but another
man living in an upstirs apartment was killed. (AP WIREPHOTO)

Ros-en's brother, Jerry, said Ro-
sen told him he had been watch-
ing television when heard a “big
boom," The next thing he remem-
bered was regaining consciousness
in the back yard.

Mrs. Surgent apparently was not
at home and her whereabouts
could not be learned immediately.

A Mohawk spokesman said in-
vestigators had recovered both the
flight data recorder, which makes
it record of such factors as plant-
altiliidc and speed, and the cock-
