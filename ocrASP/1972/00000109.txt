’JUST IONOII Ml—I'M NOT RUNNING"

Is Council a Clique?

Opinion by
Pat Curran
Central Councilman

‘Though I may disagree with
what you have to say, i will
defend to the death your right to
say it."

Now let's take a look at Central
Council‘s Viewpoint (excepting a
few members): ‘Siuce [don't care
about what you have to say, anti
since you're apathetic anti igno-
rant anyway, shutiup and go back
to sleep.‘

Consider the followrng issues
that have been brought up at the
last three Council meetings:

A. Limitation of ()t'fieers' terms:
A bill was proposed on February
[7 that would have limited the
President alill Vice President o
Sttitlent Association to one (one--
year) term. ()ii thequestion itself,
i feel that eir‘r‘lrriris e\ery year pill
the choice of who and for how
long a person \vill seiie into the
hands of the student hotly

Ilnwevr-r, II was rulcil tlial this
was a constitutional Illitllt'l'. anti
could not lie eirennivenleii easily
by a (‘euirai Council hill. When an
amendment was introduced the
I‘tillowrug vveek (only after the
sponsor of the bill trletl Io reworil
il sti as to avoid the constitutional

question), the Council focused the
discussion on the issue of limiting
terrris, rather than considering
whether or not to call for a
referendum on the matter. The
supposedly representative body of
the students formetl its own bias,
anti proceeded to deal with the
proposal accordingly. Central
Council didn't like the itieus ex-
pressed in the amendment, so
they killed it, rullrer than thinking
about whether or not the students
should have a chance to look it
over.

B. Mass Metliti Conference Ap-
propriation: A request for $525
for a coirfererice on campus of our
media groups anti news services,
etc., (which would collie for a
weekend to ilistrtiel anti ativise)
was refused because it was oriete
ted to the left-wing. Vine: htit
instead of killing the hill altogeth-
r-r, ('ouneil could have sent it l):tt‘k
to committee to consider brilarr

too many of these was an objec-

more about the referendum, and
on the second, our role was that
of referee rather than it censor.
For example, I personally disa-
greed with the content of the
limitation-of-terms amendment,
hut voted iii favor of letting the
student body decide. Don‘t over-
look the distinction, as (lid many
members of Central Council, who
were blinded by their own prev
judiee.

With the Council taking so mtteh
upon itself in the way of making
decisions (anti completely igno-
ring their constituents in the pro-
cess), it is little wonder that stu-
dents, eiglit thousand strong, sigh
iii frustration at their inability to
affect their student leaders.

Now. Heard the latest? 'l‘he
"'I'hursday Night God" is in the
process of settling closed the

clique a little lighter. It has heell
proposed that seats on Central

preceding May). rather than hold-
ing an election.

This is the same (‘ouneil that so

Fight the Hike

Several students traveled to Albany State from ()Ilt‘tillm
this past weekend to drunr Lip support for an anti [tiltliili
lobbying campaign scheduled for next Tuesday .it the
legislature. It seems that Oncorrta has emerged as the
campus that is spearheading the resistance iirriveiiiciir

    

against the trustees announced tuition and board hikes.
Students and faculty will be coming to Albany from that
college en IIIEISSL‘WII week from today in the hope that they
can convince their legislators not to pass the SUNY budch
with the tuition increase intact. That‘s all it [ach to kill lllt'
hikes.

What the students from ()ircorira wanted to kIIII\\ u.i~.
why students from Albany State have done .ibsoluirh
nothing to protest the increases. Surely. they .Iskr‘il, il

Resignation Demanded by Italians

 

O'Connell Hit for Ethnic Slur

opinion by Roberto Di Scipio

Recently the ASP reported on
the fact that Senator Muskie zil-
lcgedly laughed at an ethnic slur
by one of his-aides in a statement
about French Americans of New
England. The slur was made in
Florida. Nonetheless the ASP did
not report a more vicious insult of
the Italian community this past
week by the Democratic ('otiuiy
chairman.

Mr. Daniel O'Connell, :i IIItIClIIIIL‘
boss Ill Albany‘s present regime
and County ('lrairtiran of the De-
mocratic l’urty last week in an
interview on WOKO news said he
felt that the firemen of this city
shouldn‘t get equal pay Willi
Albany‘s police. The firemen have
been calling for parity with ilie
police as is the ease mother cities.
llowever iii Albany there is irritiilr-
er ctiiirplicatirin whereas the pn-
lIL‘t' are pfctltilltlllilllllv lrisli, the
firemen are predominantly lliiliziu.
However the Albany ('Iai didn't

stop here. When asked about Fri-
ther Romano, chaplain of the
Albany fire department who has
helped the firemen‘s cruise, Mr.
O‘Connell referred to Father
Romano as "u Dirge sort of a
bitch..." Needless to say many of
Albany’s Italians are angered and
demanded that O'Connell apolo-
gIZe for this gross ethnic insult
over radio.

Tire Italian American Student
Alliance calls on Mr. O‘Connell to
resign immediately from his post
and make ‘tl public apology to the
Italian community for this ethnic
slur. We realize that not even that
Iiignl George Wallace talks like
this pig, We also call on all stu—
dents rif Albany State in sign a
petition demanding equal pay frir
Albany's firemen. We wonder
where this cariipiis'
leftists are when workers demand
L‘tllltlllly. We wonder if there is a
lack of interest in this workers
struggle for parity because the
predominantly

Italian—“dagoes”, as Mr. O’Con-
nell would say. Perhaps when it
comes to “dagoes”, the “WWW?

in opposition to the abuse, exploi-
tation, discrimination and defa-
mation which has been our
people‘s tragic history in this
“land of the free..." The time is
long overdue that Italians in this
area fight back its Italians in other
cities are ﬁghting. Blacks, Pucrto
Ricarrs, rind Chicanos have learned
too that certain minorities iir this
country cannot achieve civil and
human rights without fighting for
them. If you are an Italian with
any pride in your blood, their
