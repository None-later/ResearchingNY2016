“We did fairly well," Coach B’rian
Kelly said after the State Ivaer-
sity of New York Athletic pon-
ference Swimming Champions-
hips, “we swam as best as we
could, and we knew what we were
up against." ’

The Albany State mermen did
know what they were up against
and travelled to Buffalo State
Saturday with hopes of placing in
the individual events rather than
taking a high place in the team
standings. However, it does not
sound as if it was a pointless
journey. The hardy swimmers
finished their season by setting six
varsity records.

Len Van Ryn placed fifth in the
400 yard medley, sixth in the 500
yiird freestyle, and ninth in the
1650 yard freestyle. In doing this,
he set three new records. Pete
Gerstenhaber also can be placed
on the list of new varsity records.
He placed fifth in the 100 yar

butterfly and seventh in the 200
yard butterfly. Bill Hart set one
varsity record for Albany as he
placed sixth in the 100 yard back-
stroke. He also placed eighth in
the 200 yard backstroke.

Other Albany placers were Marc
Eson, eleventh in the 200 yard
backstroke and twelfth in the 100
yard backstroke. Hart,
Gerstenhaber, Les Pcrretz, and
Van Ryn captured eighth in the
400 yard medley relay.

Buffalo State won the team
championships with a total of 371
points. Albany came in ninth with
67 points over an elchn team
field.

“Len Van Ryn would have to be
the outstanding swimmer in this
meet." Kelly commented. It takes
an entire team effort to perform
well, and this determined team
will be looking forward toward
next season.
