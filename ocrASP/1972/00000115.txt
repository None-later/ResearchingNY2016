legislator Pushes For
legalization of Marijuana

by Maida Oringher

If the bill recently introduced in
the New York Assembly by
Franz Leichtcr (Demnliibn-
Manhattan) should pass. anyone
over eighteen could buy a pack of
marijuana cigarettes at his local
liquor store.

The bill is not expected to get
out of the Committee on Govern-
mental Operations this year be.
cause. according to Leichter. of
the conservatives. But the As-
semblyman is optimistic for the
future. "More and more people
see the similarity between the
illegality of marijuana and the
prohibition of liquor." Leiehter
told this reporter at a recent
interiiew. "Most are beginning to
realize that their ideas about the
htirmfulncss of marijuana are
merely myths."

From ti poll circulated in his
district in 1970. liciehtcr found
that 65% of his constituency fa-
vored the legalization of "Hill
jiianti. l.cicltter expects even
greater support for his bill after
results are tallied from this years

March 22. The report is expected
to recommend abolition of all
criminal penalties for private use
and possession of marijuana.
Iieiclitcr pointed ottt that Nixon
chose the members of the pre-
dominately conservative Corn-
mission with the idea that they
would keep penalties for posses-
sion of marijuana. "but when the
path looked tit the facts they saw
that there was no substance to the
myths surrounding the drug."

Last year Leichter unsuccessful-
ly sought passage of II bill in the
Assembly which provided for a
system of control similar to that
which applies to alcohol. He has
introduced the same bill this year
with some modifications.

State Tax on Grass

The latest version calls for the
creation of a State Marijuana Au-
thority which would “license and
regulate growers, producers. man-
ufacturers. and distributors of
marijuana." The Authority would
“require it warning on any pack-
age or container of marijuana re-
garding possible Ill effects on the
ltcaltli ol' the user."

Marijuana would be sold at retail
only Ill licensed lllllllli' stores and
he subject to all pit-sent rules aiitl
regulations pci'liillllllg to such
stores. according to lictt'litt~i"s hill.
The lnll stipulates that no one
llllllt‘l' [it would llt‘ allowed to buy
iiiai'ittiaiia. and it would bar at|\ci~
tixing ot the product.

"The |l|lt'l‘ of a pack of mari-

juana cigarettes would be estu-
blished by the ‘wurking market'.“
said Leichtcr. The bill also pro-
vides for a state tax to be levied
according to a standard to be
established by the Authority.

Iieichtcr said that there may be
truth to the rumor that some
cigarette companies have already
begun to set up factories to manu-
facture marijuana. "It would be
something less dangerous than
what they manufacture now." he
said.

Halt-Hearted Approach

At ti press conference held sever-
al weeks ago. Leichter “strongly
rejected the half-hearted ap-
proach" taken by the New York
Temporary Commission, headed
by Assemblyman Chester R.
Hardt (R.. Amherst). A bill intro-
duced by Hardt does not eliminu
ate penalties for possession of
marijuana. Instead it provides that
possession of up to V4 ounce of
marijuana should receive it maxi-
mum scntence of now more than
three months. the term for a Class
ll misdemeanor. At present such
an offense is a class A misdemean-
or, carrying a maximum sentence
of one ycai'. Leichtt'r stated. “the
iiiajortty proposal of the (‘om-
itiissioii to reduce penalties t‘oi
most use is an ineffective and
illogical response to the wide-
spread consumption of marijuana
III New York State."
