BELFAST (LNS)~ The sun rare-
ly shines in Belfast during the
winter months. A permanent.
gloom in the form of a low
hanging mist and foul smelling
smoke from the thousands of
coal-burning fireplaces makes this
city most depressing. But this. of
course. is the very least of it.
Belfast is an occupied city under
virtual martial law, reminding you
of a Hollywood film on Germany
during World War ll. Thi." time the
Gestapo is made up of British
troops.

The visitor immediately 
comes aware of the saracens (Bri-
tish armored cars) roaming the
city streets with automatic rifle
barrels protruding from narrow
slits. Unseen eyes are watching
YOU. Every day. in any section of
the city, you can see British sol-
diers ducking into doorways or
crouching against buildings. These
young mercenaries are scared and
angry. and they can't help but
show it.

A state of urban guerrilla war-
fare exists here. In Belfast, as in
[ado-China. there are no fronts;
the guerrillas are everywhere. And
since January 30th. when thirteen
Catholic demonstrators were mur-
dered by the British. the [RA

(Irish Republican Army) has
gained hundreds of new recruits
and thousands of supporters. The
Official wing of the IRA has put
revolutionary theory into practice
by joining the l’rovisionzils ii
bombing attacks. Every day M‘\
eral buildings are leveled, Every
day snipers attack British Stiltltt‘l's.
and quite often banks and ottiei
establishments are robbed.

And throughout all this. the
British are increasing their reac
tion. lnternmenl is escalating.
there are now about 1.000 inipii-
soned without charge or trial.
Ciitholic homes are raided: doom
are beaten down. back yards are
dug up in search of arms and
ammunition. Any male over sir-
teen is subject to “a rest". more
women are being detained than in
the past. and the torture is her-oin-
ing more intense.

Morale among the Catholic
working people has nevor been
higher. Children of six or seven
talk of their hatred of the liritisli
troops in a cool and unemotioiial
way. Wives of internces have not
resigned themselves to the fate of
their husbands; many have joined
women's action groups. And Illc
older people. who have waited a
long time, can see freedom on the
horizon.

Towing Step-Up Raises Questions

by Glenn von Nostitz

Campus Security's new policy of
towing all illegally parked Cars
took effect last Monday. and has
led to the rinsing of some serious
questions about campus parking
regulations. The increased towing
has also underscored the wide-
spread confusion among students
and faculty over which rules are
still in effect. and which ones have
been phased out.

The last complete listing of regu-
lations was published by security
in February of I971. and since
that time many new chanch in
policy have been made. As a
result. most drivers remain unsure
about exactly where they can
park. and what “'1” happen if they
park in "illegal" places. l'Iven Se-
curity Director James Williams
confesses tlial the parking situar
[ion is “a mess" and that he
"doesn‘t understand il'~ himself.

Much of the parking confusion
has centered around the regu-
lation forbidding parking on the
quads Security has been ticketing
and has now begun towing cars
which are parked on the gravel
near the residence halls. wtth llie
c\ceplioii of Indian Quad. which
still has no parking lot. Many
students prefer to park on the
quads because of the loiig ~ up to
tivv minute walk from the lots to
the residence halls.

()n Colonial Quad. however. the
students have additional reasons
for avoiding the official parking
lot. The parking area is poorly lit.
and plagued by potholes and mud.
Originally constructed in 1969 as
a “temporary” condition for some
three years. and there is little
evidence that substantial improve-
ments will he made soon. The
Colonial Quad lot has become the
source of many complaints to
university authorities.

Perhaps the most convincing
reason for not parking on Colonial
Quad lot is vandalism. Colonial's
lot is situated further front the
quad than either Dutch's or
lndian's. and is partially hidden
by trees and undergrowth. The
poor lighting also contributes to
the high amount of theft.
Students who consistently park
their cars overnight in the Col-
onial lot should realize that their
car is likely to be the eventual
victim of vandalism. including
stolen wheels, radios. and tape
decks. broken windows. and
slashed tires. From January 17th
to February 20th of this year. 10
major vandiilisins were reported
on the Colonial lot, while only

one each were reported for the
State and Dutch quad facilities.
Refuses to Use Lot

At least one Colonial Quad resi-
dent. Robert Frecling. refuses to
use the official parking lot. and
illegally parks on the quad in-
stead. Fi'celiug claims that a tape-
(leek was stolen from his car's
glove compartment. and that
another $230 worth of additional
damage was Inflicled. lle inquired
with security about obtaining a
special permit to park on the quad
because he was afraid of st ill more
damage. but his requests were
denied Although he has received
over 30 tickets. and has been
lowed away once. Fri-cling still
refuses to park on the (‘olonial
lot.

Thus far l"reeling has not been
asked to pay any of his fines. but
he questions securit policy of
continuing to issue p. iking tickets
when no attempt is made to en-
I‘oi'cc llicin. Security l)ii'cctor
Williams responds that Ilicrc is no
enforcement because "if someone

 

 

receives :i ticket. and iel'iisi-s to
pay II. llicrc is little we can do.'
Williams goes on to explain that
security does not have the number
of men required to do the paper-
work If the 25.000 tickets issued
annually are to be enforced.

Nevertheless. a lot of time is
spent issuing tickets for which no
effort is made to collect. Assistant
Director James Conolly says that
it should take “3 or <1 minutes"
for a security officer to write a
ticket. His boss. Williams. feels
that this estimate is too high. and
that. only one miinitc should be
required. Freeling timed a security
officer and found that it takes
two minutes to write a ticket. and
he calculates that during the
month of December. when 1646
tickets were issued. security spent
3293 minutes. or four full days
writing tickets which were never
enforced. He adds that December
was not. a full month due to the
Christman vacation. Williams.
however, feels that although the
tickets are not enforced. they still
serve as ii deterrent to illegal
parking.

What security can do - and has
begun to do - is to initiate a
massive towing operation. Begin-
ning last Monday. any car which is
illegally parked will be towed tit
the owner's expense. Last week
58 cars were moved under the
new provision. According to Assis-
tant Director (Ionolly. the set fee
is $lt) for a car to be towed.
although this cost can vary dc-

  

 

pcnding on the little of day and
whether the frontvcnd litls to he
jacked.

All lowing fees go to the par-
ticular service station called to (lo
the job, Conolly claims that
“security doesn‘t get a nickel of
it." With nearly sixty curs being
towed each week. this amounts to
ii rather tidy sum for the service
stations involved.

No Quad Parking

John Buckhoff. Director of the
Physical Plant. gives three major
reasons why parking on the quads
is prohibited. The most important
of these is structural; the graveled
areas were not constructed with
the intention of having vehicles
park there. According to Director
Williams. the base is a "mulch
clay" covered by smooth stones.
and that for parking to be per-
mitted there. it would he neces-
sary to "stabilize the surface" by
spreading and compacting several
additional layers of stone with oil.

Buckhoff says that he would not
object to paving the graveled areas
next to the quads. Williams. how-
ever. claims that not enough
money is available for such an
undertaking. and that the paving
of the Colonial Quad lot would
have a higher priority.

Besides the lack of money.
another objection to paving the
quad areas is ecological. The trees
would lime to be i'emchd. and

 

. w

1")“

such an action would lead to loud
complaints from various campus
clnii'onniciit groups and con-
ccrned individuals.

A second reason liuckhol'l' cites
for the quad parking regulation is
the maintenance problem inherent
when cars park on the gravel.
Particularly in the spring. when
the ground is muddy. nnich of the
gravel is lost and deep ruts
develop. Last year maintenance
had to purchase over 200 tons of
stone to replace what was lost
because of quad parking.

Still another reason Bucklioff
gives for the regulation is the
damage inflicted on the trees
when cars piirk on top of their
root systems. or when careless
drivers back into them. Director
Williams claims that many trees
have been killed in this way. To
remove the trees would. once
again. result. in the voicing of loud
complaints from environment
minded people.

The reason most commonly
given for the quad parking prohi‘
bition. however. is that parked
cars “obstruct emergency vehi-
cles." Williams explains that in the
case of a fire. it would be difficult
to move fire equipment into the
proper positions. and that ambu-
lances would have difficulty at-
tempting to park near the resi-
dcnce hulls.

Whether or not the parked cars

would obstruct firefighting opera-
Iions is questionable to some
people. ’l‘hiI fire hydrants are lo-
cated in the residence halls them-
selves. and the cars. it is claimed.
would not obstruct firefighting
vehicles because they are not
parked on the roadways.
No Money Seen
The central problem facing se-
curity is the lack of money for
making improvements -particulary
with the Colonial Quad lot. Ac-
cording to Director Williams. “we
don't get one red cent from the
state" for improvement and main-
tenance of parking and road facili-
ties. All of the funds for such
projects come only from parking
and registration fees. Even this
money is not sufficient for the
needed improvements. as most of
it goes to such projects as painting
the double yellow line on the
perimeter road ($2500 each time
it is done) and replacing stolen
stop signs at a cost of $50 each.
SUNY Chancellor Ernest Boyer
told this reporter a possibility
exists that 1' $5 University-wide
parking fee will be instituted next
year. lf such a fee is charged, it
will most likely not lead to major
improvements in the parking
situation. since most of the funds
would be consumed by main-
tenance and repair projects. Thus.
$5 Albany State parking fee
would slill not provide enough
