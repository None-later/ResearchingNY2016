revenue for the reconstruction of
Colonial Qiad lot. Boyer also
pointed out that many Univer-
cities have parking fees of over
$20, and some, such as Cornell,
have fees of over $100 a year.

it has recently been noted that
the security building parking lot
has been considerably improved,
and when Security Director
Williams was asked where the
money for this came from he
responded that “it cost nothing"
because “it's only some shale we
had dumped there" and that "the
security lot will be a mudhote
again in about twganrranths." The
security lot, like the Colonial
facility, is “not a stabilized sur-
face" Williams added.

Williams was also questioned
about how security could build a
visitor's parking lot, while the
Colonial lot remains unimproved.
He claims that it was possible to
build the new lot because the
parking fee charged there covered
the cost of contruction. Security
found it necessary to go $10,000
in debt to build the facility, and
Williams says that this will be paid
back through the revenue col~
lected.

One possibility presently being
explored as a method to raise
revenue are parking meters. The
meters could conceivably be
placed in front of the academic
podium, although Williams is
“leery of them" becaiise they cost
$00 each. There would also, he
points out, be extensive problems
of maintenance and collection,
and ticketing and towing would
have to be continued for
motorists who fail to pay.

Towing Will Continue
Both the ticketing and steppctl‘
up towing are expected to cori-
tinue, and the towing could even
increase as the weather becomes

warmer, since the parked cars

Colonial Quad resident Robert Freellng conducted
a parking survey some two weeks ago in which
various questions about the Colonial Quad parking
lot were posed to students waiting in the dinner
line. Freeling drew up a sign requesting that
students who use the facility stop at a table he hiid
set up at the head of the line. Following are the

Are you happy with the conditions in the colonial
quad parking lot? Yes, 0. No, 91.

Has your car ever been vandalized while parked in
the lot? Yes, 31. No, 60. Has your car ever been
towed away? Yes, 8, No, 61.

Comments dealing with the condition of the lot
included: “Afraid to walk to car in dark, lot needs
to be blacktopped, parking terrible, should be able
to park on quad, lot should be condemned."

Freeling also discovered that most students re.
ceived tickets for parking on the quad between 2

Among the varieties of vandalism reported to
Freeling were: battery stolen, body damage, gas cap
and gas, hood pushed in, broken window, engine
wires stripped, rear bumper smashed in, slashed
tires, mirror stolen and
damage, glove compartment broken into, hub caps
stolen, slashed top, stolen license plates, etc.

create deep ruts in the mud when
they are illegally parked on the
gravel or lawn. Comments
Williams: “Towing will continue
until we clear all of the bottle-
necks", particulary near the
biology building

Campus security is considering
closer cooperation with the Motor
Vehicles Department. It is hoped
that university traffic tickets will
eventually "carry the same
weight" as tickets issued by city
and state police.

Security also plans to purchase
its own tow truck, which would
be financed by towing revenues.
This would eliminate the greatly
varying fees now prevalent -rntcs
which range anywhere from $10
to $20 depending on the time of
day and service station called.

Unanswered Questions

Several questions about the
parking situation still remain un-
answered. Many students have
wondered why there is discrimina-
tion in parking. In the Dutch and
State Quad lots, faculty and staff
parking is closest to the podium,
while residents and commuting
students are farthest. Students
have begun to ask: Why not have
mixed parking?

()thcr students havtI questioned
security's $10,000 debt incurred
to build a seldom filled visitor‘s
parking lot, when the Colonial
Quad lot remains in extremely
poor condition. Although Direc-
tor Williams says the revenues
collected will pay for the visitor's
lot, it has been pointed out that
these revenues will be brircly suf-
ficient to pay the attendant who
was hired to collect the fees.

Council Puts Nix on

    

"War 'l'ax" Measure

by Kim Steven Juhase

Central Council, Thursday, in an
amazingly short session
accomplished relatively little. The
only assertive action taken by the
body was to appropriate $1,200
to the Music Council to bring the
Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra
to the Campus. The money is to
be considered a loan and will have
to be paid back by the Music
Council from the receipts of the
next three Council performances.

A measure introduced by Jack
Schwartz which would have had
the Student Association pay the
10% Federal Telephone Excise
Tim. the so called “war” tax, to
the Albany Coalition for Peace
and Justice and to a Schenectady
peace group, failed for lack of
consideration on a motion by
Mike Lampert, President of the
Student Association. Lampcrt
stated that as a non profit State
institution, the Student
Association does not pay the
excise tax.

The Council also made no at-
tempt to ovorturn Lampert‘s veto
of a Council bill passed last week
which would have given a vacant
Senate seat to the runnerup in the
original Senate election. Lam-
pert's Veto message, quoting from
such sources as the Federalist and
Albany Student Press, basically
stated that the measure, if allowed

to become effective, would have
disenfranchised freshmen. Lam-
pert's statement said that Fresh~
men were disenfranchised enough
already.

The final action
Council was to consider a motion
by Pat Curran to adopt the policy
statement of the Studcul
Association of State University, or
which Albany is not a member.
The statement called for, among
other things, an additional $50
million appropriation for public
higher education, iin end to public
assistance to non-public schools.
and an eventual end of tuition at
all State University units, Many
Council members said they didn‘t
agree with everything given in the

taken by

statement and wouldn't vote for
the whole provision. ()thers stated
that there would be no use in
asking the Legislature for so much
since they could never get it
Curran then stated that he would
be willing to withdraw his motion
if the Council came out with one
of it’s own. Eventually, when it
was obvious that the Council was
having trouble in wording their

own statement, the matter was
referred to the Ad lloc
Committee on Social and Political
Positions on a motion by Mikc
Lampert.

Student Vote Imperils Vested Interests

commentary
by Larry LaMotte
Friends Committee on National
Legislation
Student voters are cxpccially
dangerous lo the powvrs-that-be
primarily because they are the
most cohesive and organi‘rcd seg-
mcnt of youth in the country.
Even with the handicap of non-
voting slalus, students exerted in
the 1070 (.‘ongrcssiorral elections a
substantial amount of electoral
political power.

Spurred by the invasion of Carli-
boilia and the killings of students
at Kent State and Jackson State,
students across the country joined
hands to raise funds aan work in
the campaigns of anti-war Cori-
gressional candidates. In some
cases students actually directed
the campaigns.

In at least 38 Senatorial and
Congressional campaigns in 1970
where students played a signifi-
cant part in the campaigns, 10
youth supported candidates won.

In light of the fact that young
people wore excluded from voting
at that time, student support was
even more significant and success-
ful.

In November of 1971, the liber-
al Americans for Democratic
Action published a list of 40
conservative House members who,
on the basis of the number of
students living in their districts,
and the plurality that the conser-
vative House members won by in
1970, could be defeated by stu-
dents. Of course it must be recog-
ni . that students are not mono-
lithically liberal. The 1970 Sena-
torial campaign of Conservative
James Iiucklcy had many hun-
dreds of student volunteers work»
ing successfully for Irisclection.

()f the 40 conservative Congress-
men in All/t's list, '27 of tbern as
of November 1, 1071 are in states
which allow college students to
vote iii their college towns. Many
other states are currently under
challenge in the courts to give
students this right.

The prospect of a substantial
youth vote seems to have played ii
major role in the decisions of
several Congressmen not to run
for re-election in 1072. Fourteen
House members, including nine

Chaos at the Registrar’s

The registrar’s office is beset with extensive backlogs, and
the seriousness of them is becoming increasingly evident to

the university community. More and more students are
voicing their complaints about the slow and sometimes
noncxistcnt service; extensive delays involved in changing
courses; and onc to two month delays in the processing of
transcripts. The transcript delays are particularly serious,
because transcripts are so vital to the future lives ofso many
students; latc transcripts jeopardize a student‘s chance of
gaining acceptance to a college or professional school.

The reasons for the delay are not certain. Registrar
Thomas Burnettc has attributed them to a lack of adequate
staffing: the registrar's office presently has two unfilled
clerical positions. ()thcrs, however, have charged that the
delays are part of a deliberate ‘work slowdown‘ ordered by
the registrar to dramatize his office‘s need for funds. While
this charge is difficult to substantiate, the fact remains that
students ill‘t' complaining of “slow scrvicc," scrvicc which
many have (()111C to fch is intentionally slow. In a rcccnt
letter to the ASP, a concerned student voiced the com:
plaints of many others who have suffered at the hands of
the registrar: “H;er you cvcr had to wait the usual 5-10
minutes before somconc realizes you didn‘t just wander iii to
look at the room?" Perhaps illt'rt'lucumlly is a ‘work
slowdower

Wc admit that lhc tight budget situation has apparcnrly
Ili't'cssitatt'tl extensch cutbacks in office staffs. But this
does not cxuisc monilrsloirg rlclays which, at least in»

in mailing our bills on st lrcdnlc?

l’crlrrrps :r fcw rciorrrmcntlaiions are in order here, l‘n‘st.
wc suggcsi that the rcgisirar's office supply students with
blank cnvclopcs and lcl thcm type their own addresses. and
their turn them in with their transcript request forms. We
also rccoimncnd that the office hire two or tln'cc additional
students under the work study program during peak
periods, aird assign at least one of them cxclusivcly to
transcript processing. Finally, we urge a complete reorgani-
zation and “houseclcaiiing” of the entire operation. One
student who was employed [here characterized the office as
“chaotic, and completely unorganized", and this same
observation has been cxpresscrl through other channcls as
well.

'l‘lrc situation will coniinuc to worsen unless something is
donc soon. We only wonder what will happcn when the
lime arrives for us to ri'cclvc our diplmnas. How long will
the delays be then? For the present, howcvcr‘, we only
suggest that if you plan to l‘t'LIllL‘Sl a transcript or change a
course, you do so at least two months in advance.

dents can pose substantial threats
to incumbents. Voting is ineffec-

'|,uul only when people decline to

excercisc this right, thus letting
others control their lives,

In 1072 with many seats being
contested in areas where the plu~
rality of the incumbent is smaller
or cqurrl to the number of stu-
dents in the district, the strident
effect on Itliose campaigns could be
substantial. If students trike ad-
vantage of these opportunities the
Vietnam war could be ended. mili-
tary spending could be cut rrrnl

It is of paramount irriportance
to hold the people who have been
elected to public office accounta-
ble for their actions and positions.
Grassroots participiition goes be-
yoan the confines of the voting
booth. It is the duty of cilircns to
register their opinion on issues
wiht their elected officials by ei-
ther mail, telephone, or personal
visits to home offices or capitol
offices. Above all citizens must be
well informed on issues that affect
llll Americans. If elected officials
ignore the demands of his or her
constituents, new candidates
should be found to challenge
those incumbents. Voting occurs
only periodierrlly but citizen prrrtlv
cipatlon must occur continuously.
