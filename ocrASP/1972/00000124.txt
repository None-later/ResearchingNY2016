Wallace Expects Florida Victory

Florida Seeks “New Faces"

in electing Gov. Reubin Askew anti “the walking
senator," Lawton Chilcs, in 1970, Florida showed a
strong desire for new faces. This desire should help
Muskie, Dauer said. "Many think Humphrey isover
the hill."

Floridians didn't trust some of their former
officials and they don‘t trust Washington, either,
says Jim Minter, an aide to House Speaker Richard
i’ettigrew.

“A national sunshine law for a platform would be
a real winner," he suggested.

The implication was not lost on Muskie and
another Democratic contender, Sen. George Mc-
Govern of South Dakota. McGovern said (‘ongrcss
ought to adopt such a law. Muskie praised Florida
for having government “more open than in any
other state in history."

 

   

"Florida is a microwsm oi the United States from

brand of political thought and action except the far
left."

came around, they could still vote for GOP presi-
dents.

Twice, in a state that was three-fourths Democrat,
Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower won.
in 1960 Nixon carried Florida with 796,000 votes
to 749,000 for John i". Kennedy.

Lyndon B. Johnson broght Florida back into the
Democrat fold in [964 but his margin over Barry
Goldwater was slim compared with his landslide in
the rest of the nation.

Nixon again carried Florida in 1968 but Wallace,
running on the American independent Party ticket,
denied him a majority. Nixon got 887,000 votes,
Humphrey (377,000, Wallace ($24,000.

Humphrey Needs Large Vote

Democrats also bolted their party to elect Claude
Kirk in ltttiti to he the first GOP governor since
Reconstruction and to semi Republican Ed Gurney
to the Us. Senate in 1968. But they bounced right
back to elect Askew and Chiles.

H is generally believed among Democrats that any
candidate who fails to poll a decent vote in Florida
might as well step down. They also think the

 

 

“The issue," added Democratic Rep. Shirley Chis-
holm of New York, the only black and the only
woman running for president, “is that the American
people no longer trust their political leaders."

Fickle Florida Democrats

in national elections, the Florida political situa-
tion is complicated by its many thousands of
registered Democrats whose hearts belong to the
other side.

For nearly a century, it was a solid Democrat
state. The Democratic primaries were decisive be-
cause the party's candidates always were elected.

Thus, Northern and Midwestern Republicans im-
migrating into the state in large numbers registered
as Democrats to have a voice in choosing state and
local officeholders. Bul when the general elections

primary gives Humphrey his last chance to stop
Muskie.

Others in the Democratic lists are Sens. Vance
iiartke of indiana; former Sen. Eugene McCarthy of
Minnesota and Mayors John Lindsay of New York
and Sam Yorty of Los Angeles. Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massat husetts signed an affidavit saying
he was not a candidate.

McGovern Gets Young and Old

McCloskcy's entry against Nixon raised no eye-
brows in GOP ranks but Ashbrook rang a hell with
Florida‘s conservative party leadership. Ashbrook
expresses no hope of victory but believes that if he
can get as much as 20 per cent of the vote, it will
lit lp steer the President on a more rightward course.

if McGovern makes a good showing in the
Democratic race, the bulk of his support likely will
come from the two age extremes. A University of

have found McGovern the candidate “most sensitive
to our needs."
