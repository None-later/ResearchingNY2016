any flirtlicr comment would seem to be superfluous and irrelevant.
However. a number of things should be re~emphasized about this most
moving. exceptional film which as a must-see for anyone interested in
the cinematic art.

Hogdanovich's roots are in the cinema of the Thirties iiiid Forties.
the heyday of such humanist filmmakers as Ford. Welles. Renoir. and
llawks (all of whom in some way consciously influence Bogdiinovieh's
work here.) THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is the triumphant work of a
man who has the courage to look brick to where the film has come
from. ii director who knows that the filmmaker‘s first responsibility is
to tell snine kind of story which will evoke audience empathy arid
prompt us to say. “Yes-~—yes. that's it!“ For beyond the mere pursuit

unconsciously seeking ‘li'ulh.' which can take the forili of a slihliiiiiiiiil

Pops at the Gym

by Dave Hirsch

The SUNYA gym was not built
for orchestras. Acoustieally it's
probabl', the world‘s largest bath-
room. But the Albany Symphony
Orchestra and the Dave Brubeck
'I‘rio overcame this difficulty last
Saturdin to present an evening of
very enjoyable music.

The orchestra. under the baton
of Julius Hegyi, started off the
program with lbcrt's Bacchanale
which is neither very interesting
noi- very Baechanalian. The did.
however. play it well. and the
group really shone in segments
from Rimsky~Korsakov “Sche-
herezade." playing with tre-
mendous vitality and a big solid
sound which seems to belong to
an orchestra from someplace big-
ger and more exciting than Al-
baliy.

Scheherezade was followed by
"Mars" from "The Planets" by
(lustov lllilst. I don‘t especially

lish and vaguely dull. It did. how-

Brubeck was at his best ii. irn

the one set the trio did on its

during this set with some fine
solos and strong back-up work.
The acoustics did their worst dam-
age to Bassist Six. who was only

semi-audible. What I heard was
impressive. but I didn't hear
much.

After the "Gates" number. the
Symphony anti-climaxed the eve-
ning with another movement from

the program that was under par. 1
