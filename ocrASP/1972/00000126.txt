’Loss of Five’

Causes Matmen Downfall

by Kenneth Arduino

“Our downfall started second
semester when we lost the five
guys." is wrestling coach Joe Gar-
cia's reason for the 5-5-1 season
that the matmen compiled this
year.

The five wrestlers he is referring
to are Cliff Wess, Don Marrone, Jim
Nightingale. John Lutz and Rudy
Vido, all who (lid not wrestle the
second scmcstci'. It is hard for a
team to replace fch starters and
still have a reputable record. One (if
those. rcplacciiicnts was co-i'aptain
cht' Albrccht who was liii rt and did
not wrestle in the early part of the
season.

For the othcr four it was neces-
sary to reach into tlit- rcscrvcs.

Coach Barbara J. l’iiliii attrib-
iitcd llic loss to ii "lack of experi-
cncc." -Exprcssing hope for the
future, Palm added “If we get
thcsc girls back next year we'll
liarc a good team." Other than
the two junior collcgcs in
competition, Albany had the
youngest sqiiiid.

According to Coach I’iiliii. the
girls played cscclli-iit defense. “if
all hadn't been playing dcfcnsciill

come as far." (,‘oach l’iilin was

second on the team in total points

third in points doing ii great job
despite nagging knee injuries.

Both Mim brothers made it to the
N.C.A.A. championships, but both
were defeated. Larry Inst ii tough
match 7-3 while Phil was pinned in
the second period after leading 3-().

Tom Hull (118) again (lid a fine
job, losing oiin once in ducl
matches. 'l‘oin, fifth on the team in
points with fifty. had the fastest
pin of the season, 20 sccotitls
against It.l’.l.. Al Mcrccr( 100) was
forced to play up a weight and it
showcd but Al did contribute three
big pins.

Doug Bauer was the tcani leader
in points with sixty-four. Doug
wrestled in all the duel iiicctsdoing

a great job and finishing second in
pins with five. Doug ii freshman
with continued improvement
could be a big star for next year.

Even though only two wrestlers
are graduating there is still ii nccd
for more Wrestlers. One thing Al-
bany has always lackcd was ('(itiipc-
tition from within for cacli posi»
tioii to spur the starters to grcaIi-i
acliicvciiicnts.

For ncxt ycar, ('oach Garcia
“A lltlt‘lt‘lls for a favorablc si-ason

Swimmers Improve Again;

Tougher Schedule Upcoming

By Bruce Maggin

“We brokc cvcry varsity I’l‘t‘tll'tl

said Swimming (.‘oat‘li llriaii Kclly
talking about the swimming
season that just cndcd.

it has been ii slow improvement
for the nicrnicn. The team won
once in their first year. two last
year and thc swimmers finished
up this season with tlirci- victories
against ninc (lcfcats. Kelly stated
“This show continued improve-
merit."

The Danes swam to victories
over Paterson State, Stony Brook
and Binghaniton, plus placing
ninth in the SUNYAC Swimming
Championships.

The outlook for next year ap-
pears bright. All of the swimmers
who are not graduating are ex-
pected back including star free-

stylcst Lcii Van ltyii and linttcr-
t'lycr I’ctcr (lcrstenliabci'.

Recruiting swiniiiici's for nc\l

with the other tcains at Allltllty‘
Coiicli Kelly cannot offi-r Scholar

"l'vc recruited sonic fini-

Next year Albany will find some
tougher opponents. SUNYAC

heads the list. Look for Albany to
win one or two more meets next
year but don't expect iiiiracli-s

NCAA Bumps Hunter

Opinion
By Bruce Maggin

Once again the National Col-
lcgiate Athletic Association has
disqualified another team from
the College Divison Eastern Itc-
gioniil Tournament. The NCAA
not satisfied with eliminating
Albany and Brockport. has ruled
Hunter College of the City of New
York ineligible. Hunter had a
record of 20-4.

Just like Albany, Hunter was
disqualified because of tlic ridicu-
lous 1.6 prediction. Hunter was
