AMMAN, Jordan AP -

semiautonomous state of Palestine on the west bank
of the Jordan River, once Israeli occupation forces
withdraw.

The Palestinians and most of the Arab world
denounced the proposal.

There was little likelihood Hussein's statement
would have any immediate effect on the 2,2
:70-square-mile area. The Israeli army there has no
intention of withdrawing until 'a final peace agree-
ment has been signed by Jordan and Israel.

Hussein's plan calls for the establishment of two
semiautonomous regions on either side of the
Jordan River, both under his control.

Premier Golda Meir of Israel rejected the plan,
saying it “negates the cause of peace and puts
obstacles in its path."

CALCUTTA, India AP - Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi's Congress party trounced the Marxist Coni-
munists in West Bengul's state election last week as
easily as the Indian army beat Pakistan's in East
Bengal three months ago.

Now Mrs. Gandhi's forces face the monumental -
and perhaps impossible - task of restoring confi<

WASHINGTON -AP- Draft Director Curtis W. Tarr
today directed his 4,100 draft boards to order men
born in 1952 who have lottery number 1 through
15 to report for Army duty on dates from mid-April
through May 31.

The action is expected to fill most, but not all, of
the 15,000-man request for April, May and June.
Tarr said he will issue the June call no later than
early May.

One reason for the uncertainty of how much of
the 15,000-man call will be filled, Tarr said, is that
this is the first time the Uniform National Call has
been used. Under this, men are ordered into service
on a nationwide basis.

WASHINGTON - AP- The House voted 366 to 0
today to authorize a $1 billion, three-year federal
attack on drug abuse.

It agreed to a comprehensive compromise bill,
containing President Nixon‘s ideas for a special
White House office. and sent the bill to the Senate
for final congressional action.

The special presidential office would unitc federal
antidrug efforts until mid-1975 - then a new
national institute, coming into being six months
before the White House office expires, would take
command of the national drug battle.

Along with programs to clirl) drug abuse, the bill
would provide for treating and rehabilitating vic-
tims.

WASHINGTON -AI’- Harold S. Gi-nccn, president
of thc International ’I‘elephonc Ki ’l‘elcgraph Corp.
testified today that none of the company's officials
had anything to do with the disappearance from
Washington of I’l"I‘ Iobbvisl Mrs. Dita Beard.

She left Washington after publication in Jack
Anderson's column of a memo from her linking the
out-of-cinirt settlement of government antitrust
action against I'I"I‘ to a financial contribution from
I'l"I‘ to the 1072 Republican National Convention,
“I know of no I'I"I‘ executive who told her to get
out of town." (icnccn told the Senate Judiciary
Committee. “I'm told she needed a rest. We had a
commitment from her to keep us informed of her
whereabouts at all times but she did not," he said.
