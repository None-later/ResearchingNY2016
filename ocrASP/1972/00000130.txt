Pay Extra for
"Privilege"?

To the Editor:

The recent decision by the
Board of Trustees to raise tuition
in the SUNY system has produced
a lot of thinking about the
finances of SUNY, the state, and
the nation. For those of us who
will be hit by this incredible tui-
tion hike, we feel as if our in-
terests have been totally left out
of the picture. Due to inﬂation,
the cost of living has spiraled
upwards, yet I can't see why I
have been considered better able
to afford such an Increase than
the highways of New York State.
I don‘t enjoy the prospect of
paying for the deficits in the state
budget when I am a full-time
student, not It full-time worker as
Governor Rockefeller is. If the
coiit of living hasni. doubled in
two years, why should my tui-
tion? Where is the increase in my
paycheck to meet this doubling
figure? I would appreciate it if the
Board of 'I‘rustces and the legis-
lature, would inform me, so thrill
may find the money needed to
complete rny education. All this is
incredible, and along with the
raise in room rates and the com-
pulsory board rate, higher edu-
cation will soon become a luxury
for the rich, only. All this is it
serious matter, and the full imporA
tanec of the recent decision will
be Intlietited by the number of
students who will move off cum-
pus, and who may even be forced

funds.

As an upperclassman, the prob-
lem has been even further com-
pounded. I am told I must pay an
extra $150 over the tuition rate of
lowerclassmen for the privilege of
receiving a better education. I
hope someone from the Board of
Trustees is standing next to me
when I preregister on the I 1th out
of 15 days. Will someone guaran-
tee that I will receive a better
cducaton when I am closed out of
all the courses I want? As a
senior, I will be closed out of
courses by freshmen and sopho-
mores, yet be told to pay an extra
$150 for the "privilege"! Who is
kidding whom? This is adding
insult to injury. No upperclassmcn
should be required to participate
in such a force. I request, no,
demand, that upperclnssmcn get
to prcrcgistcr first if that extra
$I50 is added to our bills. If the
tuition hikc remains, with the
extra $150 for upperclammcn,
then give us a chance to find out
what this “better education" is
like. There can be no excuses, it its
a simple matter to inform the
student body that the alphabetical
order of prcrcgiatration will hold,
with one small exception—Seniors
and Juniors first, Sophomores and
Frcdimcn, second. It. can be done
if the administration takes the few
necessary steps to accomplish it,
If this or a similar measure is not
adopted; then I will expect to see
the figure of $650 on my bill for
tuition. No one has any right. to
charge me for something I won't

House

To the SUNYA Community:

On Thursday, March 9, the Stu-
dent Affairs Council met to vote
on the proposal‘for an Inter-
national House at Albany, and it
is now on the agenda for next
year.

First it will be located in Saylcs
Hall, Alumni Quad. The residents
will be graduate, undergraduate,
co-ed, and hopefully, close to a
5050 mix of American and
Foreign students. With an em-
phasis upon programming, the
House will provide an opportunity
for individuals to work toward a
better understanding of one
another. With the rich diversity of
cultures and people, residents and
non-residents of the House should
obtain a far greater awareness of
their own strengths, weaknesses,
as well as othcra' values, thus
providing them with a consider-
ably added dimcnsion to their
university education.

Next Wednesday, March 15, is
the Interest Meeting for those
people wishing to apply for assign-
ment in the House next. Septem-
ber. There will be two meetings
held:

1) Campus Center—Room 375
at l0:00 p.m.

2) Saylcs Hull, Alumni Quad, in
the lower lounge at. 7:00 p.m.

A his time, we will explain
assign-

ent, notification, and answer
any questions that may arise.
Please urge anyone interested to
come to one of these meetings.
Applications will be made avail-
able in the tower office, Inter-
national Student Office, Bru-
bachcr Hall office, and Waterbury
office. The deadline for turning in
all applications will be Monday,
March 27, at 5:00 p.m. Tth can
only be submitted at the Inter-
national Student office, or Bru-
bacher Hall office.

Anyone wishing furthcr infor-
mation can contact Arlee KHSSCI-
man or Ruth Fordon at 472-7671
weekdays from 9:00 a.m.~5:00

Our "Effluent"
Society

To the Editor:

Well, chalk another up for our
“effluent.” society. As many
people know, beginning with the
graduation of 197], graduating
seniors were required to buy their
graduating gowns. Antl get this:
they are made of pop r!

their returnable bottles, SUNYA
gets rid of its returnable gowns,

One can only assume that this
practice will be repeated again this
year.

The Kosher
Kitchen

To the Editor:

I was most pleased to learn of
Vice President Hartley's decision
to establish a kosher kitchen on
Dutch Quad for next semester.
After eating frozen T.V. dinners
for three years, I am looking
forward to a nutritional diet at
the same cost as the regular plan.
Also, there will be ample quan-
tities of both the main course and
side dishes.

I know that many months of
hard work and planning on the
part of students and FSA repre-
sentatives went into this project.
It is my tiinccrc hope that the
kosher kitchen will rcceive the

support of Jewish students on this
campus.

Sincerely,
Howard Karpel
