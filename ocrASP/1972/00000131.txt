As wttli 'l |ll€ lAS'l' l’lt‘lllRI' SHOW (i\.S.I’., 3/ l4/73) it's difficult to say anything
about Stanley Kubrick's A ('L()('KW()RK ORANGE - not at the llellmatr Towiie -‘ that

they are his friends - the liberals, “Liberals will Irate the film." says Stanley Kubrick.
How right he is. The ﬁlm shows them tip as the t'aseists they are.

Alex murders the owner ol‘ri health t'arnr and is ernprisoiied. It is a nineteentli‘eerttury
prison, ivliere an eye is given for an eye and the chaplain warns ot' a hell to come for
unrepentant sinners. Military discipline: stand behind that wlirte line. But then Alex is
transferred from prison to medical l'acility. The MI’ is replaced by a l'rteiidly arttt aroririd
