a Black Weekend here at State was
first realized with the aquisition
of Miss Nina Simone for the con-
ccrl. To prove that dollar signs are
no measure of success. Nina was a
hit among the students while the
books. unfortunately, remained in
the red. The organizing committee
had much to learn about working
within the white power structure
but their effort and the perform-
ance of Miss Simone overshadow-
i-d all else and the event was very
worthwhile.

With this spirit. a second week-
end was launched aan it. too. was
cvcntfui. I’haroh Sanders was on
hand for the main concert. While
there were those who could not
appreciate Sanders' approach to
nuisic, the attempt on the com-
mitti-c‘s part to present a ‘com-
plclc' affair was applauded. With
various workshops and discussions
representing different outlooks, it
was hoped that enough participa-
tihn would be stimulated to make
them cl‘fcctivc.

The Albany State Judo Club

The 8 team. which is made up

Once again the question of the
physical education requirement
has come up for consideration.

This time. however. I hope some
of the myths concerning gym will
be forgotten and some serious
consideration will be given to
abolishing thc reipiircincnl and
granting credit.

One of the arguments advanced
in favor of eliminating the gym
program is the fact that ii is the
only remaining undergraduate rc-
quiremcnt. 0n the facc of it this
contention might be enough . but
there is much more involved.

I myself cnjoy gym but I have
seen many people in my classes
who dislike it with c‘qual fervor.
Most of these individuals havc
neither the dcsirc nor the ability
to stick with the courses. 'l‘bcy
use the maximum number of cuts
alIchd. Also. they all too often
make it known to their coaches
and other incnihcrs of ilic class
that they woulrl rather be clscv
whcrc. Half-hearted efforts are
just one cxamplc of their discri-
chantmcnt.

In some cases such action is
disruptive to the harmony and
effectiveness of the program.

 

 

number of entries (six in a seven
man field.) Even though they had
an automatic loss because of this
they fought an excellent match to
capture second place. They were
led by Captain Stuehassen.

The A team, composed of six
brown belts suffered more from
forfeits due to open positions.
Despite wins by Jack Ludin. Rich
Levitan and Doug Salomon. and a
good showing by Captain James
MeGIynn the team was unable to
make up for the open seventh
position.

Coach Robert Fountain is opti-
mistic for the future because the
club is young and growing. Pros-
pects for next year are very high.

Abolish Gym Requirement

._ ,. Opinion
"8 By Mike Igoe

I believe that physical education
is an important part of education.
By the same token. though, I also
feel that there are so many other
subjects within the wide range of
courses offered by the University
that can aid in the development of
thc individual.0nc field of instruc~
tion should not enjoy preference
over another.

The motto of State University
of New York is. “Let each be-
cornc all he is capable of being."
To me this means that a person
should have the option of choos-
ing or rejecting the means by
which hc can better himself. It
should entail one's own decision
on any course from Calculus. to
Comparative Religion. to Physical
Education.

Besides. the fact remains that
thcrc is very little possibility of a
mass exodus from the Phys. Ed.
program. A recent survey of stu-
dents showed that 62'} would
have registered for physical educa-

tion cvcn if it wasn't rcquircd for
graduation.

Another factor involved is the
granting of credit. To say that a
gym class is not worthy of credit
is a ridiculous statement. I cordial-
ly invite any member of lITl' Uni-
vcrsity Senate who feels that thc

Like any other course. gym is a
learning experience. It requires a
different type of knowledge by
comparison to some other courses
of study but it's certainly of equal
value and importance.

I sincerely hope the University

Lampcrt bill not in the light of set
