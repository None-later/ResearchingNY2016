continued from page 5

the Association of American Uni-
versities for 19 years. said that the
practice of public and private
four-year colleges to supply
homes for their presidents is a
common one, “from the oldest to
the newest institutlons."

While the practice may be a
common one, so too has the
practice of raising dorm rents and
college fees to cover such prac-
tices become almost as common.
Despite increasing fiscal problems,
the State managed to acquire a
$135,000 house in 1967 for its
then non-existent president of
SUC at Purchase. The new college.
located in Westchestcr County—
noted for high priced homes—
announeed the appointment of its
president. Abbott Kaplan, last
year. He receives $37,856 a year
with an expense budget of about
$1,500. Kaplan pays an annual
rent of $500 for his home.

Most recently. the State has
acquired a $50,000 house for the
president of the Agricultural and
Technical College at Canton. The
rent for this house is $300. In
1960 the State purchases liVo
houses for university heads. One is
a $94,000 home for the president
of the upstate Medical Center, for
which he pays $500 annual rent.
The other residence, purchased
for $68,000, houses the president
of the College of Forestry at
Syracuse. There is no rental
charge for this home. A lot, at a
cost of .‘SI l,l00. for the home of

the president of SUC at Brockport
was purchases in 1969, but budget
cuts put construction in doubt.
The Brockport head. who receives
$39,416 plus $1,500 for expenses,
is paying $500 a year for a tem-
porary residence on campus until
a permanent alternative is deter-
mined.

Only one college presidcnt can
say that he pays more rent for his
state provided home than SUNY
students pay for their dorm rents.
I’lattsburgh College President,
George W. Aiigcll pays $715 a
year to live in his $30,000 home
acquired by the state in 1948.
Angell receives a salary of
$35,776 and an expense budget of
some $1,500.

SUNY colleges at ()swego, Old
Westbury and the Maritime Col-
lege at Fort Schulyer did iiol
purchase separate homes for their
chiefs because they were included
as part ol' the campus acquisition.
All three college presidcnis pay
$500 annual rent.

None of the State's five Sliitiiv
lory Colleges-College of Ceramics
at Alfred University, College of
Agricultureat Cornell University.
Schmg of Industrial and Labor
Relations at Cornell University,
and vetenary College at Cornell
University-provide housing for
their presidents, nor do the net—

der SUNY's auspices.

DUE TO POPULAR DEMAND

Next Friday is the LAST DAY to get

The Legislative Commission on
Expenditure Review studied the
state housing supplied for em-
ployees in nine state agencies in-
cluding SUNY. The concluded
that residents supplied with
homes “consider their low rent
housing to be salary augmentation
and a raise in rent has the effect

of a salary cut." In analyzing this
argument, the report read. “Even
though such housing exists for the
convenience of the State and,
legally. cannot be considered addi-
tional salary, the practice of State
agencies over a long period would
tend to imply that these accom-
modations were a government

granted stipend to employees."

The report also went on to state
that “State supplied housing is
not provided through a formal
program: it results from a tradi-
tion of supplying housing to cer-
tain employees..."

Student Residents Needed for
Sayles Holl International House

For the first time on this cam-
pus. American and foreign stu-
dents intercsted in living in an
International environment will
find this opportunity a reality.
Beginning in September of 1972,
Sayles Hall on Alumni Quad will
become the Sayles International
House. With over 285 students
from 58 nations represed on the
Albany campus, the House can
readily provide an enriching ex-
perience for students with differ-
ing backgrounds, both resident
and non-resident.

l"or example. those people stu-
dying history 01' sociology can
learn first hand about comparative
governments. Language majors
will be able to increase their
speaking ease through constant
exposure in a comfortable and
informal atmosphere. All will have
the opportunity to live with
others who are genuinely
interested in sharing life styles.

International Nights...

Many ideas such as International

Nights, a gourmet cooking club. a

coffee house, International lloli—
day Festivities, and curriculum-
biiscd programs such as language
labs have been suggested. The free
atmosphere of the House will
create many opportunities for
residents to initiate programs.

Siiyles Hall was chosen for its
warm and inviting atmosphere.
The fireside lounge, ballroom.
large kitchen area. game rooms,
study lounges and additional
areas, lend themselves to both
formal and informal gatherings.

In order to establish the House
for |072-7.'l, a committee of in-
terested foreign and American
graduate and undergriuliuite stu-
dcnts, began compiling informa-
lioii from Houses on other cam-
pus ' as well as visiting the Cen-
ters already in operation at Stony-
brook and Cornell. On January 28
a proposal was finally submitted.
It was later approved by the Corn-
mittee on Student Residences and
the Student Affairs Council,

Tonight, the Concert Board pre- ‘
sents what promises to be one of '

the better concerts of the year.
Delaney and Bonnie headline a
show that includes Billy Preston &
the Master's Children and Ken
Loggina Kr Jim Messina. For those
of you who might want to know a
little more about these acts: Dela-
ney and Bonnie are virtually an

institution in the music business. .

From their hands have come do-
zens of today's top musicians -
d ru m m ers, bassists, keyboard
players, singers. and hornmen...

Keys. Claudia Linnear. Rita Cool-
idge and others. DhB take their
roots in gomej‘ pop. soul, blues.
and rock and roll. And you never
can tell what famous names might
turn out to back them...

Billy Preston has the distinction
of being discovered by and record-
ing with the Beatles (on Gel
Back). Reminiscent at times of
Ray Charles, hc delivers his origi-
nal material in a strong, gospel-
Iaced style. While his album is a
bit unfocusedV his I‘I wrote a
Simple Song shows what he can
do at his best, and that is fine
indeed.

Ken Loggins is a folksinger and
writer of some repute. His mater‘
ial is warm and thoughtful, his
delivery ingratiating. Jimmy Mes-
sina, formerly with I’oco lit. the
Buffalo Springfield, plays a spare.

extremely inventive arrangements
which span the gamut of com

Of the many, many people I asked. relatively few even knew that an

turned off by the pseudo-intellectualism of the few who write the
articles. This clique, from its articles and reviews, seems to be a group
