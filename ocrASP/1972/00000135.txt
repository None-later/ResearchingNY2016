Wallace Sweeps Florida

by JERRY BROWN
Associated Press Writer

Vice President Sprio ’I‘. Agnew
says Alabama Gov. George Wal-
lace has been the subject of II lot
of unfair political innuendo even
though there was nothing radical
about his campaigning for this
week‘s Florida primary.

“I haven't heard him say any-
thing that I would consider radical
during that campaign," Agnew
Said Wednesday during a speech at
Drake University in Des Moines.

But, Agnew added, "It seems to
be the general impression - and
this is again characteristic of the
political innuendo that streaks
hack and forth across the nation
that he is somewhat of a reaction-
ary person who is trying to de-
prive the minority groups of their
freedom and bring out the worst
of their emotions, causing us to
divide as a people."

Wallace will compete next in the

ded, “I like the plan and am just
trying to weave elements of
modesty into it. Why not coordin-
ate it. with the one against capitol
utilities?"

“I‘ agreed with McAlisch‘ that
the kidnappers should demand the
c ssIItiIIn nl' bombing in Indochina

nI-rs at home as ransom. III the

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

April 4 Wisconsin primary, where
he got 24 per cent of the vote in
1964. He declined to predict how
well he will do this year, but said
“we know that the average citizen
in Wisconsin, and other states, in
my judgment, feels just like they
do in Florida."

However, Humphrey said he
considers the issues in Wisconsin
far different from those in Flor-
ida.

"I don't consider the Wisconsin
electorate the same as the Florida
electorate." Humphrey said at a
news con fernece in Milwaukee.

Wisconsin’s primary includes all
11 Democrats who were on the
Florida ballot plus Rep. Patsy
Mink of Hawaii.

Muskie, viewed by many as the
Democratic front-runner before
Florida, enters Wisconsin as an
underdogI according to his state
campaign manager.

Muskie also is competing in next
Tuesday's Illinois primary, where

he is challenged on separate fronts
by Sen. George McGovern of
South Dakota and former Sen.
Eugene J. McCarthy ofMinncsota.

Muskie and McGovern are com:
pcting for a share of the 160
national convention delegates who
will be elected Tuesday.

However, McGovern is not en-
tered in the separate preferential
contest which heads the Illinois
ballot. Muskie and McCarthy are
the only contestants in that hat-

SP

Agnew said that “something
Gov. Wallace was saying must
have struck a responsive chord in
more than just the people of one
section of Florida."

Wallace received 42 per cent of
the vote in Tuesday's Democratic
primary in Florida. Sen. Hubert
H. Humphrey of Minnesotaplsced
second with 18 per cent, followed
by Sen. Henry Jackson of Wash-
ington at 13 per cent and Sen.
Edmund S. Muskie of Maine at 9
percent.
