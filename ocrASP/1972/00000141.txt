Schaeffer Brewers Edge N.-J. All-"Stars"

By Bruce Maggin

Last Saturday night semi-pro
basketball took over the univer-
sity gym as the Albany Schaeffer
Brewers edged the New Jersey
All-Stars, 124-123.

The tempo of the game was a
mixture of Harlem Globetrotter
basketball“I school yard basketball
and some really fine ball playing.
The main difference between
minor league basketball and major
league hoop is team work. The
brill players were contempt to
play onc-on-one and often (lid not
look for the open man. Many
times the ballplaycrs would chuck
the ball from 30 feet or drive
through the lane.

Semi-pro ball is notorious for its
lack of defense and this was so
Saturday. The game was a wide
open affair. Both teams displayed
ragged ball control as the New
Jersey turned the ball over 42
times to 41 times by the Brewers.

The Game sponsored by the
State Quad Association got off to
a laughable start before an esti-
mated crowd of 500 people. many
who were not students. The l’. A.
announcer introduced the starting
lineups, leading off with Gene
Smiley of the All-Stars. The
crowd waited for a few moments
for the player to step to midcourt
when finally one of the bull
players yell from the bench. “He‘s

not here."

However, the ballplayers did fi-
nally get down to the business of
playing the basketball game. The
Jersians got off to an early first
quarter lead but the Brewers were
able to gain a 63-55 half time
advantage led by the fine outside
shooting of captain Dave Bleau
and Phil Schoff. Schoff finished

the ball game with 40 points while ,
Bleau tallied 32.

Both teams were hampered by
the officiating. The officials made
many unbelievable calls. Barry
Kramer. star of the Brewers and
former New York Kniek, drew
five personal fouls in the first half.

In the second half, both teams

away in the Iecond half even
though Kramer injured his shoul-
der. New Jersey and the Schaef-
fera were able to hit their outside
shots with great consistency.

In the, closing seconds with the
Brewers leading 122-117, Wilbur
Allen of the All-Stars hit two
clutch shots to bring New Jersey
to within one. The All-Stars stole
the ball from the Brewers and
following a time out, Allen found
Floyd Kerr under the basket for
an easy two points with six se-
conds to give New Jersey the lead.

The Brewers threw the ball to
midcourt and found a cutting
Schoff under the basket and he
was fouled while attempting a
shot. Within one second left,
Schoff sunk both free throws to
win the balleame for the School'-
fer Brewers.

- has had the rap for being bush
league. in many ways this was
true Saturday. There was no
trainer to treat Barry Kramer
when he was hurt. When the
ballplayers wanted a drink, they
had to run to the water fountain
at the ends of the gym during
time outs. However, the game
proved to be very exciting and
most fans left the gym feeling that
the game was well worth the price
