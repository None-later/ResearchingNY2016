Vol. LIX No. l8

State University of New York at Albany

Undergraduate Academic Council:

Mandatory A-E Grading Approved 1 ‘

by Debbie Natansohn

A grading proposal which would
put all students, including fresh-
man and sophomores, on manda-
tory A-E grading except in those
courses designated by depart-
ments as “S-U" courses was
passed Tuesday by a 5-4 vote of
the Undergraduate Academic
Council. The proposal will be
brought to the Senate floor at its
April 17 meeting for final action.

if the proposal is passed by
Senate, SUNYA students will be
graded in virtually the same way
as they were before the present
pass-fail system was initiated in
1969, The only major change will
be the abolition of quality points,
and of the quality point defi-
ciency. Students instead will re-

ceive graduation points" and an
average of these points called the
“graduation index." In order to
graduate, students must present
120 credits with an index of 2.0.
Academic retention will be based
on the number of credits com‘
pleted per semester.

A minor change from the pre-
sent system will be in the with-
drawal datc. At present, the last
date to drop a course is the last
scheduled day of classes. This will
be changed to one week before
the last day of classes. The change
has been explained as only an
administrative one, requested by

the registrar to case his load dur-
ing the final days of the semester.

Divided Council

Because the UAC proposal
passed by so narrow a margin,
(5-4), II minority opinion will be
included in the proposal when it is
sent to Senate. Three out of four
students on the Council were
against mandatory A~E grading.

The Council has been sharply
divided on grading philosophies
since last August, when student
dissatisfaction with the manda-
tory S-U system prompted a re-
evaluation. Various grading sys-
tems were considered, including
an optional one, but the majority
of council felt that mixed grading
in classes was undesirable, because
it offered those on S-U no real
difference in teaching methods.
Considerable discussion centered
around whether the purpose of
S-U was to ease the load of the
student or to provide the student
with a new type of learning exper-
ience. Needless to say, the major-
ity of the faculty on the council
agreed with the latter, and thus
the final grading proposal provides
for all A-E or all S-U graded
courses - no mixture. It is hoped
that individual schools and depart-
ments will designate courses as
S-U graded.

STUDENT
PRESS

  

 

 

 

1. Grading

 

It is hereby resolved that:

a. Beginning with the Fall 1972 semester, all undergraduate students at the State University of New
York at Albany shall be graded A-E;

b. Sections and/or courses may be registered through the Office of the Registrar at the discretion of the
Department or School as "S-U Graded;”

c. The only exception to A-E Grading for a student within a semester shall be in the case ofa student
who registers for a course or section designated "S-U Graded."

 

 

 

Council members opposed to
the new grading proposal feel that
it is reactionary in that it takes
away all student options. Students
voiced concern over whether de-
partments would in fact make S-U
courses available, or simply revert
back to old methods. Student
Association President Michael
Lampert termed the proposal “ob-
noxious” and said that students
should be able to choose grading

methods by course at the begin-
ning of each semester. However,
any compromise amendments of-
ferred to the council by its
“minority” members were de‘
featcd,

Students to Caucus
Steve Gerber, II student member

of the countil, noted that a stu-

dent referendum on the issue of

S-U grading was held when the
system was first initiated, but that
now student opinion was being
virtually ignored. He and other
student UAC members plan to
hold a caucus of all student sena- '
tors so that there will be a united 1
student front against the grading I
proposal at the Senate's April 17 I
meeting. Amendments to the pro-
posal will probably be offered at
that time. t

 

SUNY Chancellor Boyer:
"Concept of University is Changing"

by Vicki Zeldin
Capital Correspondent

SUNY Chancellor Ernest L. Boyer discussed the
financial and academic future, and the student's role
in that future, of the state‘s sprawling 72 campus
university system at a recent interview.

’l'crming SUNY's financial situation "not It deep
crisis, but a comparative crisis," Boyer stated that
the current difficulty stemmed from the abrupt
lowering in support to the system. He claimed that
the university “could survive the mood of aus-
terity," and went on to enumerate areas that will be
affected if SUNY remains to be funded at thc
current $470 million level recommended.

The Chancellor stated that enrollment rates would
have to be rcthought and the permanent platcauing
of some emerging campuses might be the result of
no new funding. He also stated that any new
buildings ‘ and with them the increased cost of
maintenance - would have to be fort-stalled. In terms
of academics. Boyer claimed that if funding remains
at the present level in the future, the development
of II method of evaluating courses, to determine if
there is overlapping in some areas or If certain
majors are not needed, would be nocesmiry. He cited
the fact that there is currently II moratorium on all
new graduate and doctoral programs so existing
programs can be studied and evaluated. "The
mission and function of campus schools would also
have to be studied," he said.

Boyer admitted that, “II now tuition hike is not

out of the question," but said that there was no
plan now to raise it in the future. The Chancellor
emphasized that he does not want continued spiral-
ling of tuition, but stated that "free tuition is not
practical now." He claimed that the first two years
of college had become universal and stated that the
cost must be kept low at this IcVeI. He also affirmed
his stand that low tuition was necessary to protect
low and middle income students.

The SUNY head stressed the importance of federal
assistance and revenue sharing if the university and
the state as II whole are to survive. 'l‘crming the
picture “not wholly pessimistic." he stated, “what
happens on the federal side is very important."

Academic Future

Aside from being IIII administrator, Boyer is an
educator. and this became quite apparent as he
discussed the directions that he felt education had
to move in. The original concept of univursities as
"isolated campuses where people came to sit at the
feet of masters." has changed according to the
Chancellor.

'l‘htI question has become “what's school and thIt
isn't school" Bovor stated. He cited the massive
increase in the uvaIlabiitiy of resources because of
innovations in both the electric and the print medias
as wall as the creation of II smaller world by the
advances in transportation. What Boyer envisioned
was a continuous cycle of learning that would not
terminate with the acqultiaion of II set degree. lie
stated that "knowledge grows at II great rate." and

the custom of “putting education in the bank and
drawing upon the interest..." will no longer work.

Boyer spoke of the linking of campuses was
essential so that universities would be viewed as
resources for education. He said that learning could
take place not only in the classroom, but by the
media and through the mail. He also emphasized his
desire to make it possible for people of any age to
return to education on their own terms stating that
"education is a cycle of life that you keep returning
to...” He cited Empire State College - the college
without II campus - as an example of the system's
attempt to provide such an opportunity.

The SUNY head endorsed the community service
concept of education that is currently employed at
chcrIIl campuses. “in concept of community in-
volvement is more of II two-way street that most
campuses now haVe. 'l‘crming the university a
"resource rather than II citadel," Boyer advanced
the idea of drawing the community onto the
campus as well as involving the university in the
community. "The university will hIIVe fingers of
service out...," he said, and continued to state that
this Would help to “blur the notion of town and
gown."

'l‘hc Chancellor's ideas call for people to “study
more frequently and more flexibly..." He stresses
the coucupt of regionalism and cooperation among
institutes of higher learning. "For us to pour
concrete and build little islands...," he said, "...iII
not being realistic."
