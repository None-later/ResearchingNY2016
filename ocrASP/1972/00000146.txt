 i Sill" Chancellor Boyer: 5

Changing Concept

Addreaaing himself to the ever present lane of
teaching and research, Boyer stated, “teaching will
be Increasingly emphasized." He said that “gifted
teachers should be recognized...," and further stated
that “rewards and tenure in the past have not
refelected this..." He stressed the fact that gifted
teaching and research are not necessarily one in the
same, but stressed that a good teacher must be a
well versed and up to date scholar.

The Student Role in SUNY

; Boyer stated that he was “fully convinced that the
I F '5]. judgments of the students in this university are
I 1 important if the decisions that are made are to

' wisely guide the institution." He called student
' ' input “consultative, supportive communication,"
’ f ' and stressed the difficulty in obtaining university
I > ' communication. “One entry point is the student
' ‘ presidents...," he said, but admitted that there were
‘ i , flaws in this method as well as in random selection

of student opinions.

The SUNY head decried the “tremendous turn-
over" of students as one more fly in the ointment
for student involvement with university imues. He
said that it might be necessary to make student

i it I ‘ involvement more formalized than just special com-
" mittees, and mentioned the idea of a Student
Senate, still My though, that the problem of the
high rate of turnover would not be solved. Boyer
stated that "I‘m eager to see any model that will
involve students statewide. "
Boyer noted that students were on several special
committees dealing with issues that affect the entire
SUNY system. He listed the issues of sutdent fees,
I tuition rates, regionalism and budget priorities as
I areas of student interest on the university-wide
level. He also added that he tries “to get closer to
i the grass roots" by visiting campuses during the
year.
, - The Chancellor recognized the desire on the part
, ' _ of many students to be involved, not only as
, consultants, but as decision makers as well. He
- stated that this was “important symbolically but
not inactuality..." He cautioned that students on
decision making boards would probably end up as
the “house students," and if they stayed on the
board would become "the house alumni." “It
becomes static. ln itself it is bureaucratic...," he
said, and then added simply that placing students on
decision making boards was “not a serious solution
to the problem..." of increasing thi student's voice
in university affairs.
The Outlook
Chancellor Boyer, speaking from SUNY's new
offices in the Twin Towers Building overlooking the
State Capitol, summed up the university 's position
by stating, “The pain and confusion of transition
are there, but so are the good parts. I hope that we
have enough imagination and courage and good luck
to ﬁnd a way to direct the course of the university
, to keep in touch in the future..." While basically
optimistic about SUNY‘s future, Boyer did note
what he termed a “lack of confidence in our social
institutions...and a deep sense of skepticism..." He
laid the future of SUNY at the feet of the people by
stating, “if the people lose faith in the university
then it is dead."

lack of Volunteers Hinder
Can Recycling Project at State

by Debbie Kaeman

The can recycling project begun
five months ago, has expanded,
but it needs people. Begun on
State Quad, collection bins have
now been placed on all four
quads. and the downtown quad is
awaiting equipment. The major
problems encountered so far in-
volve the lack of volunteers and
uncooperativeness of some stu-
dents.

The program, which involves the
collection of metal cans and scrap
metal, began in October of
last year. The system involves the
use of a combination of cartons
and 55 gallon bins. On state quad
the cardboard cartons are placed
in the lounges of three of four low
rise dorms. In the fourth dorm
lobby, and on every fourth floor
of Eastman Tower, there are 55
gallon drums. The setup is approx-
imately the same for the other
three quads, but architecture is

taken in account. For instance, on
Indian the drums are on the stair-
cases.

Cans should be washed, labels
taken off, and placed in bins. The
cans from these containers are
collected once a week by student
volunteers and put in plastic bags.
They are kept in the garbage room
for a month when the Albany
National Guard picks them up at
the quad loading docks. The cans
are eventually sent to the Conti-
nental Can Company, where they
are melted and recycled.

An overwhelming amount of
cans are presently being collected,
and in this respect the project is a
success. According to Robin Sep-
toff, now head of the project,
there are usually about four truck
loads of cans collected each
month. Now that three other
quads have been added to the
program, the total for March
should be somewhat greater.

 

  
   
   
     
      
    
   

No Cooperation

The problem lies in the lack of
cooperation of students, as there
are not nearly enough student
volunteers to collect the cans. (in
State Quad, a weekly pick up has
never been missed, but there hayi-
been occasions when two people
have had to do all of the work. On
lndian Quad, the drums Imu-
reached the point where they are
overflowing because no one was
available to collect the cans. Mak-
ing the work load even greater
have been students who throw
garbage in the containers.

Despite these problems. "Thi-
future looks bright,” according to
Robin. A number of additional
projects are in the planning stages
Cooperation from the quad cafcv
terias is being sought. The quads
use a great number of cans, and If
these cans could be recycled it
would be “a step in the right
direction." The cans are currently
being saved in the Indian quad
dining hall, but not in the otIu-r
quads.

Paper recycling is the next step
which would be taken on this
Campus. Project workers are pr“-
sently considering this possibility.
Another idea being discussed is
the setting up of a City and
County recycling system. Such in
program has been tried and shown
to be successful in other cities.
Septoff would like this university
to set an example. She would like
to see every student get into the
habit of dividing their garbage
into paper, glass, and metal. This
material would then be recycled.

Most of these proposals are still
in the planning stages. Until these
proposals are enacted, the can
'WyCllng project remains the only
Program in which students can
actually participate, The work stu-
dy people, the National Guard,
and the Environmental Decisions
Commission have been very co-
operative. but according to Sep-
t0”. "The whole thing lies with
the student. If they would cooper-
"to. It would be an easy job."

SA CHIEF JUSTICE use":  

By Glenn von Nostitz

Central Council heard a rather
scathing denunciation of Student
Association President Michael A.
Lampert last night as Robert l-‘a-
miliant, a council member, read
aloud the resignation of the Chief
Justice of theStudent Association
Supreme Court.

Carl E. Stephan, charging that
Lampert is “power hungry" and
has “attempted to control more
than the executive branch," took
the unprecedented move after
Lampert repeatedly stalled at-
tempts to appoint additional jus-
tices to the court to clear a case
backlog.

Stephan called on the Council to
“help restore the Court back to It!
proper place in the Student asso-
elation."

“Upon accepting reappointment
last fall," Stephan explained in his
letter, “I had hoped an adequate
number of justice: would subse-
quently be appointed...[ requested
of the president several times the
appointment of these justices, re-
minding him of the several pen-
ding cases. thee requests were
either ignored or put off by some
excuse."

Stephan went on to explain that
more justices were finally appoin-
ted late last semester “‘as a result
of pressure" but that the action
made little difference because he

has received only one letter from
Lampert; a letter that named the
appointees and asked for action
on an enclosed referral. But, Ste-
phan observes, “There was no
referral enclosed!"

The letter concludes with a vio-
lent attack on Lampert's alleged
opportunlltic political actions.
“The history of the Supreme
Court since Michael Lampert has
been president of Student Asso-
ciation," Stephan told the Coun-
cil, “has been one of mani-
pulation, stalling, and blatant at-‘
tempta at domination of the
Court, all on the part of the
Preaident. It is because of such ac
tion...that I am resigning."

Council reaction to the resigna-

y

 

tion was awlft.

Familiant explained that Lam-
pert stalled on appointment of the
justices in an effort to keep the
court relatively ineffectIVe. "It
keepa the court weak,"he obser-
ved adding that there were so few
court members “that there was
hardly a quorum."

Councilman Steve Gerber corri-
mented that “on the surface it
(Lampert's actions) would seem
to be an attempt to keep the
court from r" I'Ie‘:I ’ ’
that qualified people were avail-
able to fill the vacancies but that
“Lampert has to find people that
agree with him."

Familiant added: “There were
many people who wanted the

job."

Lampert, who arrived at the
Council meeting late, commented
that he has not formally received
the letter and thataafaraahe was
concerned, “He (Stephan) has not
resigned."

Lampert said he found Ste-
phen's position “interesting” in
light of the fact that he was
reappointed by Lampert at the
start of the academic year.

Stephan could not be reached
for additional comment.

Art Students Mobilize:
Fight Funding Discrimination

“Someone has the impression
that the Art Department isn't very
important," adamantly asserted
Karen Zuccari, president of Art
Council. "We have to prove that
art is important! We've got to
fight for ourselves occasionally,
too. We ahve got to come out of
the studios and assert our-
selves."

And the students who filled the
graphics room, the site of the
emergency meeting called to deal
with the crisis concerning funding
of the department, were moVed to
action. Many responded to one
girl's suggestion that they appear
"en masse" before the admini-
stration and present them with a
list of demands.

Among the demands are: that
the Art Department recoivc funds
on parity with the sciences; that
the students no longer be required
to pay lab fees; aml that Mary
Raddant,a professor well-liked by
students and faculty, but refused
tenure because she doesn't have a
Ph. D., be reconsidered for tenure.

Currently, the Art Department
is appropriated about $20,000
compared to the Science Depart-
ment’s $140,000. Further break-
down rcveals that for Temporary
Service, (which goes to fund such
things as modcls and student assis-
tants), the Art Department re—
ceives $8,000, Astro-
nomy-$12,000, Biology-$10,000,

Chemistry-$7,200; for
and Equipment: Art-$11,700,
Astronomy-$12,700, Bio-

logy-$53,000, Chemistry-$42,000;
and for Equipment: Art-$200,
Astronomy-$2,800, Bio-
logy-$3,000, Chemistry-$18,755.

In addition, the sciences get 99%
of all grant money that comes in.
Although as one professor ex-
plained, this is fair because the
sciences bring in most of the grant
money, he questioned why the
administration doesn't take that
into account when apportioning
money and thuse give the Art
Department a bigger cut in the
budget since there is no way that
department can bring in grant
money.

“We have had to charge lab fees
for every class," explained gra-
duate student Cornelia McShcehy,
who organized the meeting. “This
is illegaL The students are funding
this building! Next year, we’re not
charging lab fees That means
we're going to have to stop pro-
duction in three months and the
shops are just going to have to
close."

“We, as art. students, are paying
the same tuition as science stu-
dents, but, above that, we're pay-
ing much more and we still don't
get as much as they do," protes-
tcd Eric Stogo, a student active in
Art Council.

“It doesn't make sense," con-
tinues McSheehy. "The admini-
stration can't say there isn’t any
interest in art courses.” The Art

Supplies Department has to hold a pre-pre

registration for its courses so that
Art majors will be guaranteed the
courses they need. There is a one
year waiting list for Photography.
Because of the lack in funding,
the department will be forced to
cut down curriculum. Summer
session is going to have 2% less
positions.

“The Biology department has
boats and jeeps and the Art De-
,partment can't even buy a can of
‘kerosene until April 1," McSheehy

points out. “When equipment
breaks, we can't even fix it. The
Printing Department is being for-
ced to close down because of poor
ventilation of deadly fumes. How:
ever, she observes, a requisition
for a fan, approved two years ago,
goes unheeded due to lack of
money.

“I have been here over 10
years," asserted Professor Thom
O'Connor, “and I’ve seen what
could have become a great depart-
ment go to tubes because of lack
of money. Granted, we’re into
bad times, but so is everybody
else."

Within the department, the mo-
ney is distributed by a committee
comprised of faculty, though they
welcome student representation.
However, the funds given to the
department as a whole are alle-
gedly so minimal that each area
gets only a fraction of its opera-
ting costs.

Regarding the demonstration at
the A" ' atinn " "" I” ll.
was suggested that the students
participating bring along their so
quipment and paint all day. “Why
not?" wryly commented one
student. "They have about as
much equipment as we have."
