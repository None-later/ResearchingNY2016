SUNYA Security “Aided and Abetted” Recent Campus Raid

The Ignorant Perpetuate Ignorance

“Real justice?" This was the
response of one SUNYA student
in reaction to the St. Patrick's
Day on and off campus drug raids,
Despite mounting medical and
social evidence that marijuana is

not addictive. socially or biologi-
cally harmful (in Asia. marijuana
and hashish have been used for
centuries). the police arid campus

sellers of marijuana as though
they were hardcore criminals.

The “real justice" comes in the
wake of the ﬁndings and recom-
mendations of Nixon's own hand-
picked commission to study mari-
juana. The commission, headed by
former Pennsylvania Governor
Sltafcr states that “no penalty
should be assessed for private use
or possession of less than an
ounce of marijuana." The system
(Nixon) ignores social change.
even when the social change is
recommended from within. The
ignorant perpetuate ignorance.

it is no small wonder. then, that
SUNYA's own security team,
headed by John Henighan, “aided
and abetted" State Police and
Narcs in making the Oil-campus
bust. Acting as agents of the
powerful ignorant, the police
blindly follow orders from above
(and the integrity of those above
is in hot dispute). The power of
the system remains intact.

if there is a heroin problem on
campus, it should be treated medi-
cally, not with insane use of force.
if there is a “marijuana problem,"
should our own “campus securi-
ty" aid in further social injustices?

Laws are made by men to suit the times in which they live.
As knowledge expands, men must change the old laws to
suit their own generations. During the past few years the
medical profession has closely studied marijuana and found
that it is time to change the laws that regulate its use.

The ctirrcnt marijuana laws are severe, often permitting
long prison terms for simple possession of the drug and , in
some states, imprisonment and ’eyen. death for sale and
distribution. These laws are the result of several decades
from cmotionalism, misinformation, and myths that ii;ch
recently been debunked. The following are some of the
most common: ’

myth: Marijuana is an addictive drug.

fact: Physical dependence and dose tolerance do not
develop with the use of marijuana, and withdrawal
symptoms are not seen when usage is discontinued.

myth: The use of marijuana leads to the use ofmore
dangerous drugs, particularly heroin.

fact: There is nothing inherent in the properties of
marijuana that leads to the use of stronger drugs. An
overwhelming majority of marijuana smokers never use
heroin; what causes a progression to stronger drugs are
personality and evnironmental factors.

myth: Marijuana causes aggressive behavior.

fact: The aggressive effects of marijuana are minor
compared with those caused by the abuse of alcohol:
furthermore, the pacifying effect of the drug on an
individual serves as a deterrent to violent behavior.
myth: Smoking marijuana leads to sexual
promiscuity.

fact: Although some users report greater enjoyment
of sexual intercourse while high, anyone who attempts
to use marijuana as a means to seduction will be
generally disappointed, for sexual inhibitions are rarely

broken down by the drug.

These facts have been supported by many doctors across the
country. Acting on these reports, both the National
institute of Mental Health and the National Commission on
Marijuana and Drug Abuse have supported “dc-crimi-
nalization" of marijuana.

Several New York legislators have begun to take action.
Some of the 17 laws recently introduced in the legislature
call for a reduction of penalties for simple possession; others
call for legalization. Legislators should realize that present
marijuana laws cause more harm to society than the drug
they seek to prohibit. There is not medical, legal, or moral
justification for sending those to jail who use it. As stated
by the New York Timex, “a failure of the legislators to baso
legal sanctions on the best medical evidence available can
only undermine respect for the law."

At least 68% of today’s college students have used
marijuana one or more times; therefore, the majority of
students are criminals. The general knowledge of
marijuana's widespread use serves to make current laws a
farce and should serve as a catalyst to change them.

myth: A student can do nothing to change the
current marijuana laws.

furl: A student over 18 means a vote to any
legislator; therefore, he may listen to your voicc. Write
to your representative and urge him to support
Assemblyman Franz Leichtcr’s bill (No. A 4944)
calling for the sale of marijuana in licensed liquor
stores, and Assemblyman M.H. Miller's bill (No. 3181)
calling for a great reduction in penalties for thc
posscssion of marijuana.

Passiall...Fail 'an

Opinion by
Steve Gerber
University Senator
Member, Undergraduate Academic
Council

in i969, this university em-
barked on a program of Pass-No
Credit grading for all freshmen
and sophomores. Unawares to
most students here at SUNYA,
this policy is currently under revi-
sion and by next fall all under-
graduate students may be graded
on an A-E system. Under this
proposed change, due to be re-
ported out to the University
Senate by the Undergraduate Aca-
demic Council for the April l7th
meeting of the Senate, the only
Pass-No Credit courses would be
only those courses speciﬁcally
designated S-U by the depart-
ment. This proposal is in effect a
return to the pre-l969 grading
system.

The faculty involved in the
revision of the current S-U system

 

    

FrOm S-U to Screw-U

have severely misjudged the opin-
ion ofthe student body in mistak-
enly believing that the students
were unhappy with S-U grades.
This was in part due to the vocal
protests of those students who
felt they needed letter grades for
admission to graduate programs.
However, in 1969, a referendum
was held to determine true stu-
dent opinion on the Pass-No Cre-
dit system and and one must
question why a referendum is not
being considered now to gauge
student opinion on different grad-
ing systems. ,

The proponents of the A-E plan
point to the "failure" of the S-U
system. However, S-U has never
really been truly evaluated. The
Class of l973, the ﬁrst class with
S-U grades has not yet graduated,
and the speculations as to the
effects of Pass-Fail on graduate
shcool admissions remain just
that, speCUlations. Even under the

 

Pre-registration
is Aggravation

To the Editor:

Miss Andrea Elberger ie to be
applauded for her letter published
in the March 17th issue of the
ASP. Specifically I refer to her
position that because Senior and
Junior students will be paying
higher tuition rates they should be
granted priority in'Dl’e-tcsiitru-
tion. This is the only logical and
just solution to such an unfortu-
nate situation. it is indeed unfor-
tunate that upperclussmen will be
forced to dig deeper into their
pockets in order to pay their
tuition bills. However, what. is
even more unfortunate is theI fact
they aren't at present being given
any additional benefits for their
money. How can the administra-
tion expect students to pay more
for their education and yet run
the risks of not getting the courses
they want. and need, in order to
complete it? Juniors and Seniors
are aggravated enough already
when they find themselves in the
lust alphabet group, pulling class
cards on the 15th day of pre-
regiatrution. What the administra-
tion is attempting to do is to force
them to pay more for the same
uggravationa.

As a Junior next semester, l for
one won't allow them to do this
to me without first DOING some-
thing about it. ium attempting to
institute a new seniority-based
pro-registration system which
would allow those Seniors and
Juniors who will be paying
higher tuition rates. the first prior~
ity in pro-registration. l have been
working on this project since hurt
November and don't intend to
drop it at this point. I call upon
the entire academic community to
work with me to get this proce-

To the Editor:

I would like to offer this letter
to you in hopes that it may be of
interest to your readers.

Thank you
I). Ludirrs/ty

There have been many predic-
tions about the future concerning
droughts, fumines, and such. Pre-
dictions such as these have always
existed, though usually never find-
ing themselves coming into being.
But now more than ever can
one imagine a revolt by nature, in
her trying to tell us the need for
balance and harmony.

Last summer 1 was ittvited to
share in the harvesting of some
fruit trees. 1 was timchd to see
the vual. quantity of food that was
given from these four trees. The
pears, apples, and peaches that
were picked that day would have
been enough to last it fumin for
many months in u needy situa-
tion.

i think about the many families
in our country having to receive
welfare to help in their living. And
i think about that for two or
three dollars apiece, fruit trees
could be given to them through
their welfare payments or some
government help: and in a few
years not only would these trees
be an excellent source of food and
nutrition, but they would also add
some beauty to the sometimes

these letter grades to,S-U at the
end of the semester. Past exper-
ience shows that leaving the po-
wer to designate courses Pass-No
S-U plan, few courses were taught
and graded on a true S-U basis.
Most instructors marked papers
and exams A-E and converted
Credit solely in the hands of the
admittedly reluctant faculty has
led to few educational innova-
tions.

The proposed change fails to
provide any viable means for stu-
dents to explore and experiment
in unfamiliar ﬁelds on a Pass-Fail
basis. Students should be graded
on the basis of achievement, not
on a lack of achievement. Does
the student who passed a course
his ﬁrst time have any more
knowledge than the student who
attempted the course three times
before passing it? The university,
speciﬁcally the University Senate,
must decide where its priorities

very coarse surroundings.

Some friends of mine in college
are planning to ask their student
senate if for one year they could
use their class money for planting
a small fruit orchard to be used to
help the needy of their town,
while also giving the students
something good and free to eat.
Churches could do something
similar, in either giving certain
families these kinds of trees or in
planting their own.

i spoke to my father about
planting some trees on our proper-
ty and he grouched out some-
thing about fruit rotting and the
lawn mower, extra expense and
care...but yn see dad, they are
very strong trees and almost com-
pletely self-sustaining, and agen-
cies do exist that would readily
take whatever fruit we couldn't
use to give away fresh or to
preserve: for still most of the
world is hungry.

Thank you
A friend

Meaningless
Numbers Game

To the Editor:

Let me begin by saying that the
mandatory Puss—Fail system is the
most. important innovation in
higher education since theology
was dropped us it required course
at John Hopkins University in
1876. it does more than allow
students greater latitude and flexi-
bility in their learning; it directly
confronts the inequalities that
abound in grading systems of any
shape or kind. After all, marks
given on an examination are a
reflection of a great composite of
factors other than just intelligence
or knowledge and are therefore
poor measure of capabilities or
achievement. And when used by
graduate, law or medical schools
as a means for admittance the
absurdity is overwhelming.

How can a learned person on an
admissions committee truly evalu-
ate a student by such meaningless
numbers? How can he Juatly com-
pare one student's grade with
another in the same class, let
alone in a different class of the
same course, different course in
the same field. different field in

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

lie: with the students or to some
mythical graduate school admis-
sions committee.

Grading systems based solely
on achievement have already been
implemented successfully at other
universities. At Harpur College,
(SUNY Binghamton) stﬁdents
have the option to take a course
on an S-U graded evaluation. in
addition, if a student fails a
course, (letter grades of D or E, or
Fail,) there is no entry of that
course on the student's transcript.
Yet suggestions made by the stu-
dent representatives for a system
similar to Harpur‘s have been
largely ignored by an Under-
graduate Academic Council un-
willing to commit itself to any
grading innovations.

This is not to say that an option-
al system of S-U is a necessarily
good grading system. It may place
those students who elect for an
S-U grade in a bad light when a

majority of students enrolled in,
the course are graded A-E. How-
ever, it is naive to assume, as have
'some administrators and faculty,
that the student who elects S-U
grades is not aware of its potential
pitfalls. I

The onus and responsibility of
attaining an optional Pass-No Cre-
dit system lies with the student —
it is unrealistic to hope that the
faculty will welcome a mixed
grading proposal. And it is no
longer one of the administration’s
concerns to placate a student
body which seemingly has no in’
terest in the issue, on a “political.
ly apathetic campus." This is an
issue that has bearing for all stu-
dents here, regardless of their po-
litical differences. Talk about a
new grading system, think about
the relevancy of grades, and most
important, let's get organized to
prevent the encroachment of our
academic rights.

the same school llnd ultimately
different schools? it is time for all
undergraduate centers of true
higher learning to adopt a munda-
tory Puss-Fail system for at least.
two years if not for all four. And
it is time for graduate, law and
medical schools to rely on other
methods for evaluation even if it
means using simply one giant ex-
amination. Because until the com-
mon sense of pass-full ie recog-
nized, undergraduates who have
the chance to thrive and grow
under its enlightenment will peti-
tion for A-E grades so that they
will not be discriminated against
in graduate school selection.

But while examinations are a
fact, it is high time for faculty and
administrators alike to try their
beat to make them as fair and just
as is possible.

i think guide lines should be
established to assure the student
that all tests will be equitable. It
might be it good idea to organize a
University-Wide Committee on
Examinations to loosely control
all testing procedures. This com-
mittee could set up guide lines for
various academic fields and hear
grievances against the exceptional
inequalities and suggest remedies
along general policy linee.

Naturally though, the final hope
rests with each individual teacher
because unfortunately as long as
examinations are in use, profes-
sora must recognize that exams
are and will remain an important
part of the education system. and
should not be joked with or used
irresponsibly.
