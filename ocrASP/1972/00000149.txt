"Way of Beating Out" 35:] : p, ,

Sophomore Steven Aminoff.
Arts Editor of the ASP , sees
the tuition hike as taking more of
his money. “i have a way of
beating that." he says. Steve plans
to take as many incompletes as
possible this term to retain his
sophomore status and still stay in
school. This will save him the
difference between the future
lowerclassmen and upperclassmen
rates for the first term.

No Worries

’Cause Parents Pay

 

Bernadette Bossert, a freshman
on Alumni Quad first replied.
“My parents pay for my educa-
tion. so i don't have to worry
about it." But Bernie is not total-
ly apathetic. “Sure i care." she
said,“ because a lot of my friends
have to pay their own way and
work." She believes one way of
saving money would be not to
give out houses to the administra-
tors.

 

 

No One
to Complain to

Representative of the out-of-
state student at SUNYA is Sheila
Tucker from Berlin, NJ. Sheila's
neighborhood is not concerned
about the tuition hike because,
“Nobody ever heard about Al-
bany State." Sheila. a junior, will
have to pay an additional $400 a
year. She also has a problem most
SUNY students don't have. “i
don't even have a representative
to complain to." she gri as.

point is that with so much of the

sions. and so forth. the state's

Many Take

As a senior, Jeff Weiner will not
feel the affects of the tuition hike.
According to Jeff. those that are
being affected aren't doing much
about it. "i think they are taking
an apathetic point of view to-
wards everything." Jeff himself is
not active enough to protest. but
has some suggestions. “if enough
kids get together, they should
close down the place. it is a pretty
radical view. but if anything is
going to get done you just have to
take those measures.

priorities away from highways and   

Junior Jeff Bookman was eager
to share his views. "l'd like to go
to law school.." he said. “but
probably not at a State Universi-
ty." Therefore. Jeff will be affect-
ed for only one year. Although he
is not actively involved in protest.
he attended one meeting concern-
ed with the hike. He thinks more
publicity might help. Jeff is not
too hopeful though. “it should be
fought. but if it'saecepted. we‘ll
have to." He sees it as affecting
the middle class because the poor
are subsidized and the rich can
afford it. He can forsee the costs
at state colleges rising to meet
those of private schools.

won't feel much personal effect
by the hike. "l have very good
parents. 1 have one year to go, and
they'll foot the bill." He doesn't
believe there should be separate
rates for the upper and lower
classmen.

No Tuition in France

Library staff member and inter-
national student wife. Eliette
Carlier. told of the college situa-
tion in France. The colleges are all
nationalized. charge no tuition
and have very cheap room and
board. A twenty dollar fee is
charged. which most foreign stu-
dents have covered in their schol-
arships. As for SUNY. according
to Eliette. international students
like her husband Christian who is
going for his doctorate, “have a
waiver of tuitions." in the tuition
hike last year some tuition waivers
were cut. The students met with
various administrators and manag-
ed to get some back. “Some

low Tuition a Subsidy

   

Although James Blodgett has an
assistantship. which covers his
graduate tuition. he has much to
say on the subject. "Low tuition
is a subsidy to the middle class."
He would not oppose higher rates.
as long as a higher scholar incen~
tive would subsidize the poor. He
admitted to "arguing my pocket-
book." He said the economic view
is that it is not a contribution to
society to turn out more B.A.'s.
“l‘m all in favor of having a free
education if possible. but it's a
question of priorities."

College Will Be Elitist

Senior Barbara Sakellarides said.
"i really sympathize with the kids
who are going to he scraping the
money together." She believes
college will "go back to an elitist
type of thing." She thinks that
freshmen and sophomores are
going to think even more about
school. and that if they had to
pay the same rate as uppercluss—
men. “more would be encouraged
to drop out."

Extra Burden on

Those Who Pay
Their Way

Graduate student Eunice Holt,
who commutes from Albany

doesn't think the tuition hike will
affect her. "'l‘uition should not be
allowed to go up at all for any
student." she said. “it puts an
extra burden on the student who
pays his own way...l think that's
really unjust to the student."

  
   

 

Won't do Anything

“I probably won't do anything."
says Pat Etta. “l'm married and
it’s hard enough to go to school as
it is without having to pay extra."
Pat did sign a petition. and says
that. “The march this afternoon
probably showed what the stu-
dents think."

 

Will Escape in Time

Al Lash. a senior. will escape the
hike in time. “l'm over and done
with. 1 figure that's the way it is."
What if Al were just a junior? “l'd
probably be really pissed off!" All
he could suggest was that the
students protest and petition. but,
“i don't think it would do any
good."

 

"Too Apathetic"

Junior Andrei Koval flatly said.
“l'm leaving school." He was plan-

. ning to leave before news of the

hike but it was “the deciding
factor." Andrei said that he is too
apathetic to protest. but “if i
were more involved with school i
would have." He plans to try to
get a residency in California where
he can attend school tuition free.

WilHtave to Work
This Summer

 

Has a Scholarship

The tuition hike won't affect
those like freshman Bill Heller.
who is covered by a regents schol-
arship. "However." said Bill. “i do
feel that tuition should definitely
not be raised. The state is wasting
so much money in so many ways
that it is unfair to ask students to
compensate for poor handling of
government funds."

 

Will Have to Borrow

Tema Rakitu may have to give
up a future summer abroad be-
cause ol the rising prices. “i'll
have to borrow extra money on a
loan." she said. When asked why
she hasn't protested 'l‘ema answer-
ed. “l'm iazy..l should. but...
ummmm...the protest was during
classtime...l didn't find out about
until this morning...l'm not an
activist."

 

Fran Ginsberg says that. “I'll
have ,to work this summer for
sure." Before the hike. any money
she would have earned would
probably not have gone towards
school. She still may have her trip
overseas in the next few years,
"Depending on how generous my
father gets." When asked if she
thought anything could be done.
she replied. “At this stage of the
game l'm not sure."

 

to Congressman

Lloyd Fishman. a junior. will be
working extra hours during school
at the snack bar. For the first six
weeks of the summer he has a job
with New York City. and then
will work at a camp. He wrote to
his congressman that it is unfair
that the taxpayer gets hit with a
tuition hike while money is wast-
ed. One example of such waste.
according to Lloyd. is the South
Mall. “l've been stirring at that
ugly thing for three years."

for Work -Study

Freshman Candy Chadwick in-
terrupted her studying to reply
that the tuition bike will mean
"Harder going." She has a brother
also in a state college. She will
“try to get work-studylncxtterm. i
know u lot of my friends. unless
they get help. won't be able to go
to school." if she can't get work-
study. Candy will "manage some
how." She believes a small tuition
should be imposed upon the
CUNY system.before SUNY tui-
tion is raised. She hasn't protest-
ed. and returning to her book
explained "i can't because l'm a
Bio major and i spend my time
studying."
