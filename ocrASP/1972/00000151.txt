BB: "...rebuilding
around
our battery."

by Lloyd Fishmln

The \ﬂicoming baseball season
will be "one of rebuilding," ac-
cording to Coach Bob Burlingame
because, in order to equal last
season's 9-4-1 record, the Great
Danes will have to fill many vacat-
ed positions left by last year's
graduates.

The team is characterized by
many new faces as only six letter-
men are returning.

“We are rebuilding around our
battery," says Burlingame and
how right he is. Last year's pitch-
ers compiled a superb 2.12 ERA,
and three of the four hurlers are
back. Junior southpaw, and cap-
tain, Nick Ascienzo, will be the
mainstay of the mound. Last sea-
son, he yielded only two earned
runs in 30 innings for a remark-
able 0.58 ERA.

Sophomore Kevin Quinn posted
a 3-1 mark with a 2.38 ERA,
walking only nine men, while
striking out 26, in 33 innings. The
third member of the mound crew,
Vic Errante, had a 2.26 ERA, and
two saves, as a reliever last year.
indeed, the pitching is strong and
should prove to be the core of the
team.

At the other end of the battery
is junior catcher Jack Lenhy. Jack
was last season's leading hitter for
the Danes with a .343 average. He
also led the team in RBl‘s (12). in
addition, he is a fine defensive
catcher.

Coach Burlingame sees his main
problem in the "Keystone Combi-
nation," that is, shortstop and
second base. He calls this area
“very green right now." he is in

dire need of s shortstop; however,
Dan Del-‘orest, a1 converted” first
basenisn, has the inside track right
now.

At second base, Howie lsrael, up
from the JV, la in the lead for that
position because of his experi-
ence. Much of the season's out-
come will rest on these two posi-
tions, and Burlingame has his boys
“working like the devil on de-
tense."

First base is another undecided
position. Ray Angrilla, a transfer
from Nassau Community, is lead-
ing the candidates for that posi-
tion. Angrilla, according to Burlin-
game. is very versatile and has a
good aim.

At third base, Coach Burlingame
has Bill Lapp. Lapp, according to
Burlingame, "is much improvedﬂ
expect him to be a real fine third
baseman."

The outfield is characterized by
a solid center field, surrounded by
two question marks. Occupying
that middle ground is Tony Tedes-
co. Tony was the leading hitter
during the Fall baseball season
with a .375 average.

Out in right field, Frank Cnstal-
do, up from the JV, has the inside
track. He is a good hitter, and
proved it with the Dane Pups last
year. in left field, Bill Hopkins
and Vic Guilianellu are fighting it
out. Vic is ncntcher by trade, but
plays first base and the outfield as
well. Buriingame considers him ,
“promising with the bat." Albany-
will be correcting in the
SUNY Athletic Conference this
year, and because of it, the sched-
ule will be tougher. Among the
opponents are Cortland, Oswego,
Brockport, and Oneontu, who fig-
ure to be the prime contenders.
The Danes did not play the latter
three last year, and Oneontn has
won the SUNYAC the last three
years.

how good his team is after a
week-long trip to North Carolina.
The team will glay‘da exhibition
games in seven Ila-ya against some
of the class competition of that
state. Among the four squads to
be played are Gardner-Webb Col-
lege, last year's NAIA homo-run
leader with 54 round-tippers, and
High Point College, perhaps the
best in the state.

With this kind of pro-season
schedule, the preparation must be
good for the raged campaign
ahead. if the pitching comes
through as expected and some of

the green spots are filled out'

capably, the 1972 varsity baseball
season will be a good one.

Track: "On paper, »
this is ..
the best team 'o‘vori”

The Albany State trackmeo hope to continue their 24 game winning
treat for the upcoming amson. “On paper, this is the best team
ever," mid Coach Bob Munsey.

The track team has many stars. Cleve Little, Dave Tellier and Cliff
McCard are all standouts as use runners hold all of the
school wirinting recorqh. Co‘ach Manse] sees a strong possibility that
all of these records will be hoken this year.

The Ion'r did-noes are also drong. Freshman Brian Quinn leads the
contingent m ole-Is  two-miles. Backing him up in the

‘ ‘ mile an siu Sore! and Arnie shell.
All three of them can also com-
pete in the BIO-yard run.

The 880 was weakened this year
ﬂee Peter Payne, the Albany
record holder, is studying 'off-
ampus. Payne has been Cwork '
out on his own but his availability
for meets is still in question.

The Mil-yard dash hopes rest
mainly on Sal Rodriguez, "the
Ciao Kid." He was hurt last year,
butilgllks in top shape this year.
Bill Brehn, a top 440 man last
year, was hurt in an auto accident
and his duties will be confined to
managing the team.

in the field events there are also
many outstanding performers.
The weight men are led by Don
Van Cleve and Rudy Vido. Don, a
senior, was a leading man last year
but he will be hard pressed by
Vido. In his first year of track,
Vido has broken the school record
for the shotput despite his lack of
form. Rom Andersen and Tom
Moore are the javelin throwers.

Leading the pole vaulters is
Moore, who is co-reeord holder in
this event. Roger Mattison, a
junior, should join Moore in the
pole vault. Dave Reynolds is back
spin to lead the high jumpers.
The jumpers should be aided with
the possible addition of basketball
players Byron Miller and Reggie
Smith. Smith has had some exper-
ience and anyone who has seen
Miller play basketball, knows how
he can jump.

The long jump is weaker than
Int year due to two major rea-
sons. One is the graduation of Sol
Moshenbcrg, the school's record
holder, and a third place finisher
apinst University teams of the
East in the lC4A's last year.
Andersen and McCarg are leading
the contenders to pick up the
slack.

Things are not all bright this
year. Last year, nn' injury was not
tragic as the depth of the team
was strong. Now an injury could
hurt the team immensely. The
cold weather has also hurt the
team. It has been impossible for
