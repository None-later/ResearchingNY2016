Your faithful correspondent has .

covered a lot of music lately -
some of it really fine, some medi-
ocre, and some of lt'lust painful.
So here it is:

BLUES AT SIENA: , ‘

Over a week ago the Siena Col-

lege Entertainment Committee
put on one of the finest programe
this area has seen in some time,
Their two-day Blues Festival fes-.
tured Workshop and Concert ap-
pearances by John Lee Hooker.
The Muddy Waters Band, Arthur
"Big Boy" Crudup, the Luther
Allison Band, & the James Cotton
Blues Band. After a nondescript
opening set by the (local) Charlie
Smith Band, John Lee Hooker got
things cooking Friday night with a
rousing set by the man who made
boogie. Muddy Waters followed

with a fine, strong performance -
his band was tight, full and driving

and there was an incredible

amount of energy left in ole Mud-

dy himself.

Arthur Crudup opened Saturday
night's show with a long, varied
set of his country blues. High-
lights included “That's All Right.
Mama" ("The song that made
Elvis Presley famous and left me
as broke as ever," "Big Boy"
noted) and two unrecorded, more
recent compositions of his. And
then the Luther Allison Band ex-
ploded - the sound of the future.

  

Luther is young (31) and, with his
current band, seems destined for
super-stardom. At times reminis~
cent of but never derivative of Sly
and the Family Stone, his en-
semble was tight, brassy, infec-
tious, driving...just amazingly
good. Luther himself is a fantastic
guitarist — warm. mellow, and
unique. Over an hour-plus jam
that evolved into a history of the
development of the urban blues
and the evolution of rock and roll.
the band displayed a ﬂuid sense of
dynamics and a perfect mastery of
their material and their audience.
And the audience loved it —drew
Luther back for two encores and
would have kept him all night if
they could. After a long history of
scraping around, Luther and his
band have a first-rate contract
with a good label — Motown's
Rare Earth label. Watch for their
album, and for them.

James Cotton followed Luther's
incandescence with a fine set of
his own. which unfortunately was
ruined by excess amplification
from the sound system. Since
James had bemoancd excess am-
plification in the workshop just
that afternoon, it was bitterly
ironic to see the work of this
solid, veteran performer, ruined
by one wrecked operator. The
system, "Nightshade and Dark
Productions." delivered the one

 «am and» mediocre

    

jarring note in an otherwise won-
derful weekend. Siena College is
to be thanked for putting together
this program - and I certainly
hope that they will do it again
next year.

GOSPEL-ROCK IN THE
GYM

The SUNYA Concert Board had
less luck with what promised to
be a fine program last Friday
night. The Kenny Loggins Band
.with Jim Messinn opened the pro-
gram and stole the show. Loggins
is a happy<go-luckie folkie-white
gospel type who's written some
fairly interesting songs. He gave
them a strong performance. ably
abetted by Jimmy Messina's cool,
precise guitar work and arranging
talent. Mcssinu's‘ arrangements
tend to span the gamut of Ameri-
can contemporary music, and this
night was no exception. Jon
Clarke provided wondrous back-
ing on saxes, ﬂutes, and recorders.
while AI Garth played a solid
fiddle and doubled on sax as
needed. The results were really
nice; they closed an all-too-short
set with a West-Indian flavored
jam titled “Vahevela” that really
cooked, and after a brief encore,
they were gone. I suspect we
might be hearing quite a bit from
them in the future.

After that. the affair went stesd- ’

ﬂy down hill. Billy Preston and

with a clean. driving guitar solo. l
The rest of his set, though, was
loud, clanking, mechanical soul/
rock a la Buddy Miles at his worst. I

The major disappointment of
the evening came from Delaney
and Bonnie. Bonnie herself was
fine, wonderful; the lady has style
and class in a business not often
noted for either. Their band was
OK but not spectacular;when the
sax players weren‘t soloing they
were tolerable. Delaney, though,
was something else. In a fit of I
don't know what he decided to
become his own lead guitar play-
er. As a rhythm guitarist he's just
there but as a lead player he's a

disaster. His solos were exceeded
in their stumbling ineptness only
by their lamentable frequency.
Both his playing and his general
demeanor transmitted in feeling of
internal dissolution; I only hope
that he's still around in a while...
we've seen the road kill too many
of our musicians of late.

Delaney'd left him. First I had to
suffer through a mercifully brief
opening set by Sweathog. Sweat-
hog's LPs are decent mindless
music, when you're up for that,
but Sweathog in person is LOUD,
mechanical, flashy, and beneath it
all lifeless. The one moment of
interest was supplied when

maxed his solo by using his head

New from Crabby

by Eric Graober

 

 
 
 

ROTTEN TO THE CORE: Crabby Appleton

(Elektra 74106)

Don‘t trust your first impression of Crabby
Appleton. Like the cartoon nemesis they are named
after, they may appear to have very thin qualities
but further investigation will reveal them lo be a
solid rock ‘n roll group. ullhough not the type that
aims at the jugular vein or makes you want to roll

up into a bull.

Hank Harvey's light bass is probably what makes
Crabby Appleton's music sound so hollow at first,
The core (and the core is anything but roitcn) lies in
the snappy, co-ordinnlcd drumming of Phil Jones
and Flaco Falcon (the latter on congas and lim-
bales). They like to alternate their boats so that the
drum patterns interlock. Mike Fennclly is the group
leader: he writes and sings all the songs as well as
being quite proﬁcient on guitar. Although not big
on solos. the man they go to when the going gets
rough is keyboard man Casey Foultz who gets the

only extended piece on

the album, "Gonna Save

You (from That)", and it's a good one although not
likely to knock anyone off their feet.

Fennelly's lyrics are not to be ignored either as
they often hi1 deeply into the heart of the rock 'n
roll spirit. “You Make Me Iiol" espouses the
breakup of a marital relationship to further the
beneﬁt of love: “you know it's not such a shame.
you ain’t the first and you won’t be the last to give
up the man who gave you his name." “Paper to
Write on" is a very funny spool on the typical
country-western ballad. A touch of philosophy runs
through “It Makes No Difference," a song with a
universal message: “So go on chasing what's within
your dreams, go make your time, and play your
part. But when you listen to your dreams played
back, be sure you feel them in your heart."

Quick pace, tight drumming, and strong Icadcrship
are the elements that makes "Roiicn to the Core" :1
good album. Crabby Appleton may not be an
important group but they are more fun than a
Tcrrytoon cartoon and there is nothing wrong with

that.

The Godfather Review

by Robert Varini

Those of you who have turned
purple from holding your breath
so long can relax: Paramount’s
film of The Godfather has arrived.
It cost $6 million; a conservative
estimate would be that it will
grass at least five times that
amount. It's undoubtedly the best
investment since the first offering
of shares in Xerox, and I wish I
had a piece of it. Based upon a
fifteen-month bestseller which
Gallup says seven out of every ten
Americans have read. the movie
was solid from the minute
director Francis Ford Coppola
started shooting. and the hush-
hush publicity centering on Mar-
lon Brando in the title role didn‘t
hurt. either. Like most “long-
awaited" events, however, The
Godfather is a distinct disappoint-
ment.

The problem, I think. lies in
Coppola's approach to the source
material. Mario Puzo's novel was
so widely read because it fit all
the prerequisites of escape fiction:
sharp. clear, clipped writing, full
of action, characters with whom
one could empathize, with the
added fillip that the subject of the
Mafia—sorry, I mean “organized
crime"—had never been handled
in fiction quite that way before.
Puzo's first draft of the screen-
play, we are told, was in fact the
basis for what the author assumed
Paramount wanted—an action-
Pack2d. suspenseful ‘fnmﬂy' saaa.
Then Coppola got into the act,

turning over the canneloni cart:
his aim was to create an in-depth
view of a world in miniature, a
world running itself by its own
rules. conscious always of honor
and loyalty. And thus any
thoughts of making The God-
father a French Connection-type
suspenser went out. the window.

The film runs three hours. For
much of the way it's a long. long,
plodding three hours. You see.
with Coppola at the helm. every
scene. every line, every gesture has
to relate in some way to a them-
atic statement. A henchman can-
not merely be garrotted; we have
to have a full-face, extended close-
up to emphasize the twisted moral
values our protagonists swear by.
Don Vito Corleone can't simply
romp with his grandson in the
garden; he has to cut a pair of
fangs out of an orange peel and
stick them in his mouth as a
metaphor for the conflicting play-
fulness and menace that has
guided his life. Because the
director has no sense of a personal
style—see Finian's Rainbow if
you‘re not convinced—he uses bits
and pieces of everybody else's
whenever there's a chance to
make a thematic point; ultimately
the film looks like it was directed
by more people than How The
West Was Won. Don't let Coppola
kid you—it‘s pretentiousness. not
a heart attack, that does The
Godfather in.

novel probably prompted the cast-
ing of Brando as Don Vito. Never
mind the age difference; never
mind his wax-dummy appearance
under ten pounds of makeup (I
think if the generally dim lighting
were ever brought up he'd melt
quicker than Margaret Hamilton);
never mind that his high-pitched,
mumbly voice is completely at
odds with his stocky appearance.
What Brando brings to the role is
exactly what Coppola wanted—an
intensity of feeling that would
imply the torture and torment of
the Don which doesn't come
through in the cliched dialogue—
and that, I maintain. is exactly
wrong. Since he gets no help from
the script. revised, might I add, by
Coppola, Brando must resort to
weird mouth and eye movements
alone. the result being a per-
formance that is the God-
damndest thing since Walt Dis~
ney.s Abe Lincoln dummy "got
up" and “spoke” at the World‘s
Fair. (There's a giggle or two to be
found here: Watch Brando as he's
mourning his dead son Santino at
the undertaker's. Cut out his voice
and you'll see a perfect imitation
of Red Skelton saying “Goo'night
and may God bless").

As for the other actors-well.
there are some superb per-
formances, notably Al Pacino's
Michael. Richard Castellano's
Clcmenza. Sterling Hayden's cor-
rupt cop. and Robert Duvall's
Hagen. Others are downright em-
barrassing—John Marley. shrill and
monotonous as Jack Woltz:
Richard Conte's dull Barzini
(Contc seems to be brought out of
thc woodwork only whenever
anybody makes a movie about
Italians); Diane Keaton's amateur~
ish Kay Adams; and an actress
whose name I don't know, por-
traying Connie Corleone-her
pseudo-hysterics were so bad I
cringed, visibly. Please be fore.
warned—the film is terribly. ter-
ribly brutal. It's not rated "R" for
its sexual content, I'll say that.
Weak stomachs, stay away.

As a matter of fact we should all
stay away. The tautnesa of Puzo's
novel that truly made it one you
"couldn't put down," inferior as
literature as it was, is manifested
on screeen only rarely: the rest of
the film's length leaVea me numb.

I can't say I was bored, exactly
(although it seemed the rest of the
sell-out audience was. after two
hours had lumbered by), but I
