editor’s note: The judicial work-
shop steering committee, of which
Leila Moore is acting chairman,
has prepared the following sum-
mary of the proposed judicial
system now being considered on
campus.

 

 

 

A little more than a year ago, a
coalition, of University Com-
munity members met to discuss
the problems of campus adjudica-
tion. We met as a community,
worked together as a community,
and have evolved a proposal for a
community judicial system. Sum-
marizing only the most basic
changes and inherent principles,
the Steering Committee for the
new judicial proposal would like
to present out community with a
capsulized view of the proposed
system.

Last year's workshop revealed
many undercurrents of change.
The participants had been charged
with the task of formulating a
new judicial system, developing
lines of jurisdiction, and develop-
ing adequate procedures for hand-
ling cases. But as discussion
reached its peak. it was realized

that what was really needed was a
major reorganization of the judi-
cial system - a reformation of the
mode of thinking upon which our

present judicial system was built. ~

The unification of all university
members in the process of intel-
lectual growth, the rise in SUNYA
population, the abolition of such
restrictions as prohibition of alco-
hol in residence and curfew hours,
and especially the increase in in-
fractions of a more serious nature
made it clear that this university
can Ill afford a judicial system
that is scaled to deal with out-
moded life styles and obsolete
social restrictions. Deficiencies
such as .lack of organization, in-
consistently applied procedural
safeguards, absence of coordina-
tivo efforts between and among
existent judicial bodies, lack of
means for redress (of many types)
of grievances, and ineffective
interrelationships between univer-
sity constituencies have made our
present judicial system ineffec-
tual. There is clearly a need for
the creation of a new and more
effective judicial system. To abo-
lish, or at least to minimize, the

chief purpose of this proposal.

The changes put forth by the
judicial proposal are not merely
substantive changes but are philo-
sophical changes as well. The most
important innovations have oc-
curred In the areas of organization
and Interrelationships. Pictorally,
changes in basic organization and
structure are as indicated in the
diagrams:

As noted on the first diagram,
the system represented depicts
only the student system. The
complexities and overlapping of
functions performed by other
parts of the system, in addition to
duplication of jurisdiction and
lack of definition of responsibi-
lities of each part of the system
had produced confusion and im-
perfect understandings of the to-
tal judicial system. Coupled with
the above problems Is the fact
that there is little if any mutual
understanding and/or input into
the component parts of the sys-
tem. A student has no recourse of
action against a faculty member; a
faculty member has no recourse
of action against a staff member.

ing from out current system.
Clearing House

The proposed judicial system
has simplified adjudicatory routes,
and has provided a central organi-
zational and facilitative force in
the form of the Clearing House.
Particularly in the beginning
stages of implementation, the
Clearing House will be instru-
mental in: 1) assisting community
members in determining the ap-
proprlute route of referral for
cases; 2) advising community
members of procedures to be fol-
lowed in a given case; 3) inform-
ing community members of revi-
sions to part or all of the judicial
system; 4) acting as a pre-hearing
body in emergency cases or in
cases where there is clear and
present danger. Additionally the
Clearing House would deal with
problems such as lack of defini-
tion of jurisdiction by assuring
that cases are referred to the
appropriate adjudicatory body.

Associated with the Clearing
House would be the Office of the
Clearing House Coordinator, who
assists in the smooth functioning

of the judicial system. Addition-
ally, the Clearing House Coordina-
tor may serve as a liaison between
the Clearing House and llll adjudi-
catory bodies, again enduring i-i-
fective functioning within the new
system.
Community Concept

The greatest single advantage in
the new judicial system, howr-wr.
is the recognition of the cunstitn~
ency concept. In our current
system, all constituencies (facility.
students, staff, etc.) are not
equally relayed to the judicial
sphere. The new system estab-
lishes necessary relationships lic-
tween and among the various coir
stituencies and opens channels for
redress to all constituencies. Iiy
bringing all constituency J'utlicml
practices under one system, im-
proved interrelationships (amnnll
members of the university cuin~
munity) will be fostered.

The new system also fncilituti‘s
the establishment of standards for
dealing with cases both on campus
and in the courts; it ensures mun‘
consistent application of slnml~
ards of due process; and, by rccog
nizing all existent forms of judi-

not a matter of double jeopardy
when the campus odjudicatory
bode deal with a case while the
cue II also being heard in a court
ofilow?"

The university judicial system Is
not attempting to ulurp the
authority of criminal courts. it is
a subsystem of the traditional
court system, in the same way
that military tribunals and admin-
istrative hearings are. Often a uni-
versity judicial system is best
equipped to handle cases which
occur within its jurisdiction. If
"trial by peers" is a prerequisite
of justice, then how can justice be
better accomplished than by pro-
viding that each university con-
stituency adjudicate cases in-
volving its members? University
adjudication has been practiced
here for many years, although it
has been recently that the cases
have become more serious in na-
ture. However, instances of theft,
assault, vandalism, slander, dis-
honesty and many other potential
“court cases" exist now within
eucry constituent group com-
prising this university, and uni-
versally the conxern is and always
has been for the individual and his

role within the university. Every
procedure for adjudicating cases,
now in practice or proposed, pro-
vides not for a means of avoiding
the courts of law but for indivi-
dual decisions to be made with
regard to the relevance of court
action to the offense. Nothing in
the proposal usurps the right of
the individual to seek recourse in
a court of law: it follows, then,
that nothing in the proposal
should usurp the right of a consti-
tuent group to seek recourse in
the same fashion--on an individual
basis.

SYSTEM 3

Violations of the law may also
e ’ ' “ of ' ", regu-
lations, in which one the uni-
versity reserves the right to hear
such cases even though they may
also be in process in criminal
court. Is this “double jeopardy"?
To draw a parallel, violations of
state law may also be violations of
federal law; in such instances, the
violator is subject to two trials-
one for the state offense and one
for the federal offense, even
though a single act resulted in two

concomitant violations. Both the
state and federal governments re-
tain the right to hear such a case
because each has differing juris-
dictions Double jeopardy is not
involved. The same reasoning apb
plies to the university. Our juris-
diction is directed only toward
the SUNYA community. When
the case of a violation of this sort
is heard within the university,
such a hearing constitutes the
reconsideration of the status of
the individual over whom the uni-
veroity has jurisdiction. As well as
affecting the relationship) of a
university member to the outside
community, a violation may also
affect the relationship of this
member within the university.
Therefore, the university reserves
the right to hear such a case
because it falls within the univer-
sity‘s jurisdiction. Since double
jeopardy applies only to the same
case being heard twice by courts
of the same jurisdiction, double
jeopardy does not apply to univer-
SIlY adjudication concurrent with
criminal court adjudication.
Lastly, the problem of imple-
menting the proposed judicial
system remains to be considered.
Our intent is to seek recognition
of the system as the judicial

branch of government Within the'
I' ' “, Senate, which II retrog-
nized u the primary governing
body for university matter. We
feel that the need for legitimacy
for the system is best satisfied in
pursuing such recognition . Re-
gardleuiof the ultimate "home" of
the judicﬁl' iyotem, however, im-
plementation is not difficult be-
cause it simply entails the encom-
passing of constituent judicial pro-
cesses within an overall judicial
system. The only major modifi-
cation within the sdjudicatory
process occurs in the case of
student adjudication. Many steps
have already been taken toward
the improvement of procedural
details within the student aspect
of the system. Therefore, the only
major task with regard to imple-
mentation would be creating and
insuring the effective functioning
of the Clearing House.

The new system should not be

seen as a panacaea for all ills
within our current structure. It
cannot reduce crime rates, not can
it guarantee "justice" to all. It
can, however, lead to some greater
degree of consistency within the
system itself, and it will most
certainly make more visible the
avenues for dealing with com-
plaints and infractions. Finally,
and perhaps most importantly,
this new system's centralized ap-
prouch will allow for a far more
comprehensive evaluation of the
judicial process and a concomitant
ease in adapting to current and
future needs.

The groundwork for a new and
more effective judicial system has
been laid by this proposal. We
need only to identify those within
the university who are willing to
participate.

ACPJ Budget Slashed to $0.00

by Art Breen

"T00 POLITICAL" to handle,
was the verdict of the Student
Association‘s executive budget
committee last Saturday, as next
year's budget for the Albany Co-
alition for Peace and Justice was
reduced from $3,300 to $0.00.
The Coulition,n “radical education
group," is requesting money for
films, speakers, literature and
radio programming for the '72 -
'73 year. The program for the
current year included the October
13th tench-in, the discussion with
lawyers Patti Roberts and I’ml'i-s-
nor Arthur Kinny from Rutgers,
and lith Friday's talk with Karl
Hess in the Campus Center Assem-
bly Hall. The group also showed a

series of current events films on
campus last semester, and it main-
tains a news table in the Campus
Center Lobby. For the next two
months, the ACPJ has planned
speakers from the Irish Republi-
can Army, the medical profession,
and the American Indian Move-
ment. They hope to continue
these programs next year, its well
us begin programming for WRI’I
and perhaps WSUA.

Budget Committee is also cx‘
pr ted to reject appropriations
riqur‘sts from Lllt! Pence Project
and the SUNYA Guy Alliance,
under four of the 'I'rustee's guide-
lines against political spending of
student tax money.
