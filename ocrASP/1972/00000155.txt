To flll.’ Editor:

A while ago, representatives of
thc Italian-American Student Alli-
ance presented Dr. Sirntkin with H
petition of some 1,000 numcs
calling for a department of Italian
and Itulian-Amcriciin Studies at
SUNYA. Dr. Sirntkin, though ro-
ccptivc to the idea, informed us
that there wusn ‘t sufficient money
for such in department at this
time. We therefore agreed to work
through existing departments It)
establish two courses tit least: The
Malian-American, a sociology
course, and the Hislnry of Holy,
which would be under the history
department. Both departments
made committmenta for thch
courses in talkti with us. The
history department will offer the
course on Tuesdays and
Thursdays from 9:46 to 11:00.
The course is divided into two
sections, the History of Italy from
Roman times through the Renais-
sancc (Hist. 455A) and Italy since
the Renaissance to the rise of
Famism and the contemporary
scene, with its 82 myrititl politicni
parties (Hiat. 456 B taught in the
Spring xcmceter). The course will
be taught by Dr. Barker ttnd will
be open to all students. The call

The sociology department has
approved a new course also: Elli-

Commentary by
Susie Hoffman & Les Wright

On Monday, March 20th, about
2000 students from SUNY,
CUNY and high schools acroae the
State gathered to rally and'lobby
for two bills presently in commit-
tee in the Legislature - one guaran-
teeing the continuation of the no
tuition policy at CUNY, the other
returning SUNY to its pre-l963
status as in tuition free institution.
About 60 students from Albany
joined the demonstration. Fol-
lowing is the account of the
demonstration by a member of
SUNYA Students Against Tuition
(Part of the Statewide Coalition
For Free Public Education) and a
discussion of what comes next.

When I arrived at the Capital for
the demonstration fairly early in
the morning, I was met by a
handful of others, some from
SUNYA and some from New
York. We had the task of being
marshalla and greelers. After an
hour's wait, the first buses from
New York pulled up. From that
point on everyone had his hands
full. Meeting buses as they arrived
got to be fairly difficult. For the
most part, the students were
well-organized and know what
they were to do. This is not it)
ignore a couple of problems, such
as the one bus-loud of students
who disappeared downtown b0-
oiiusc we were meeting another

A little More,
A little less

To the Editor:

I um writing this letter to inform
the other students at this univer-
sity of the far from courteous
service that I received from one of
the urea inerchuntti. About three
weeks ago I brought in a ring to
be sized (made smaller) at Stuyve-
raiil Jewelers in Stuyvesant Plaza.
The woman sulealutly at the atom
at the time estimated the price of
the job to be abont $3.00. She
told me that It might cost a little
more, a little less. I waited for
almost three weeks for the job to
be done and then finally I re-
ccived a phone call that my ring
was ready to be picked up.

Upon returning to the store I
was told that the cost. was $6.00.
Quite enraged I left. the store
telling another aelealady that I

Demonstrators at the Capitol

Refuse to See

As the numbers grew, it was
precedent-senior to watch all
these students united in protest,
including a large number of high
school students. Blacks, Puerto
Ricena and whites, from Upstate
and the City, picketted together,
assembled for the rally, and
worked together to fight. tuition
throughout the afternoon.

There were no hassles until we
tried to see our legislators. Letters
had been sent out in adVance
notifying legislators that students
would be coming, and appoint-
menta were made with several
“key” members. Most, however,
managed to have meetings that
afternoon, were out of town, etc
Some legislators did see lobbying
students, but. of those I went to
see there was no such luck.
Bridges, whom we had made an
appointment with two weeks in
advance, refused to see us.
LaVerne, who is on the Senate
Education Committee, sent one of
his aides to see us. Supposedly on
our side, that is, on the side of
education, he maintained that
education should no longer be a
priority in New York State! The
rest of the afternoon we got. no
further than secretaries. Rumor
had it that Rockefeller, officially
out of town for the day, had
called it special meeting.

At 3:30 ll second rally was held
on the steps of the Capitol. Stu-
dents felt that March 20th was it
beginning, not an end. It was the
beginning of students across the
State coming together to fight for

Students

what everyone needs - a quality
public education ayatem for us,
our brothers and sisters, and all of
society. '

Ten years ago, students tried to
unite in this way but they were
broken apart by Rockefeller and
his friends. Right now legislators
from Upstate and the City are
making a deal in an attempt to
again split up SUNY and CUNY.
The budget they plan to [lose this
weak allows the politically more
sensitive no-tuition policy at.
CUNY to remain, but leaves
SUNY out in the cold. Upstate
legislators are going along with
this deal because SUNY already
has tuition and it is easier to let
the cute go through for us. This is
why we need to stick together and
continue to pressure our legisla-
tors. They were obviously con-
cerned by a movement of SUNY
and CUNY together, and now is
the time to involve other students,
faculty members and citizens to
build enough support to become a
political power that must be dealt
with. Each year after them is
passed, a supplementary budged is
enacted. The bill for No Tuition
at SUNY is still in committee. lta
sponsor, Senator Bernstein says
strong public pressure will bring it
out on the floor. “Students
Against Tuition" is asking stu-
dents to write to their legislators
before they go home, reminding
them Ihut the increase in tuition
for SU NY is still slated to go into
effect, and that. we don’t accept a
bargain to save CUNY and leave
SUNY out.

Art Students Pay Sums Above Tuition

A

Alt'I‘ molds the senses and spirit
of its audience, the community at
large. Greater participation yields
greater scope and quality of art.
To fulfill its obligations toward
raising the cultural level of our
society, the University must sup-
port the fine arts as parent and
protector,

’I‘HE present budget does not
permit the Department to func-
tion adequately. There are not
enough courses to satisfy the Uni-
versity community's need for art
education. The art major expe-
ciltlly is humpcrcd, not only by
long working hours, but Mist) by
the monetary bite of supplies,
mutcriul, art books and ltih fees.
In financial sacrifice the artist
shows his dedication.

’l‘HE Art Department's budget
has rl'lilulllf‘d rclaliirrtly unchanged

_____—__—_—______———_______
_______—___—_—___———_____—______

Would talk to the manager the
following day. This did me abso-
luter no good at all. He was even
less obliging. He told me that the
price was exactly the same as they
were charged to have it sent away
to be fixed. I agreed that this
might be eobut that I should not
be charged for his employee‘s
negligence. I did not feel I should
be charged for her inadequacy. He
repeatedly told me that
NOTHING could be done and
that the price could not be
changed.

It was not the price so much
that annoyed me but the fact that
a cuatomer'a word is worth
nothing and that an employer‘s
mlatake will most probably go
unnoticed. Ia this the type of
store you would like to deal with?
I don‘t think so. So my advice
would be to bring your business
to other area jewelers. The service
at Stuyvesant Jewelers couldn't be
worse.

Statement by the SUNYA Art Council
[or ilirr'v years in a lime of iri-
flulion, and cannot meet students‘
demands for necessary services.
Therefore, the Art Council de-
mands an increase in the Depart-
ment's budget allotment to pro-
vide:

...More teachers and- courses, to
reach more students

...More student asaistantahips for
aefcty and availability of space
after classroom hours

...Live models for drawing,
painting and sculpting classes

...Improvements in the physical
plant, including sufer ventilation
in graphics

...Thc purchase and maintenance
of capital equipment, c.g., wheels,
kilns, presses and sews

...An increase in working space-
--lhc gallery occupies it full third
of the building

THE Art Department must be
funded on a parity with other
major disciplines represented in
the University. We insist that por-
tions of grants not earmarked by
the donor for other academic pur-
suits be used to finance the fine
arts.

IN a meeting Thursday, March
23, art students and their
teachers, in mutual support, re-
solved to end lub fees for the use
of Departmental facilities. Stu-
dents will no longer compensate
for deficient budget by paying
sums above their tuition.
Teuhe” will not further parody
n bursur's role in the collection of
funds. Unless countered immedi-
ately by an increased budget, the
production of art tit SUNYA will
suffer greatly from these twin
actions, if not come to a lhall.
