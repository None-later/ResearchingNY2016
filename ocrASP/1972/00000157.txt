both a large and warm reception

from the student body.

First on‘the progrman was an
ultra-modern beat and rythm
dance, "Pantheon"-a Selection
from "The Unsung", in which the
all-male troupe of dancing lndian
braves set a very vivid and strong
musical rythm with body sounds
and movement, minus musical

‘ score. The physical mastery of the

dancers’ movements was augment-
ed by the appearance of young
male Indian bodies shining with
sweat from physical exhaustion.

The dance conpany also present-
ed a premiere performance of
“isadora Duncan set to the music
of Frederick Chopin. The female
dancers were very impressive in
their ability to successfully cap-

‘ture tlle dance style of Isadora

Duncan. Each stage of her life was

‘Audience Apathy

Either‘classical nlusic has fallen far
out of favor, or there is lln awful

at SUNYA. 'l‘he Inst two concerts

one was almost unattended! (in

world's greatest pianists was on
tllis campus, and no one bothered
to check up on it. Roger Shields
played to about 30 people in the
I'AC's main theater. The applause
sounded like scattered gunfire.

’I‘he Ill-aux Arts concert was
really onlyllillf full--any place else
and they would have packed the
house! I don't know whelller this
is the fault of Music Council, who
(lid as little as possible to plihli-
ci'/.c lllt' concert, or the students
themselves, who fail to cheek
schedules, clipboards. or anything
else. I guess tllat on a campus
where political apathy reigns su-
preme, musical apathy cannot be
far behind.

Last on the preogram, but by no

of “The Moor‘s Pavane" with mu-

the Dance Magazine award for

structure and refinement of clas-

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Battlefield is about it soldier, Zapo
(played by Jerry Brown) who is so
bored waiting on the front that he
hides his time by knitting, and
finally asks his captain to at least
send him a goat for company.

Instead, his parents played by
Stephen Aminnff and Diane
Waterman, show up with It picnic
lunch complete with wine, cakes,
and parental advice. They instruct
Zilpo as to the proper and humane
manner in which one must con-
dllct himself during a war, es-
peciully with motherly concern
about care of prisoners. So Zi-pr)
(Marshall Winklcr) is dilly invited
to join them as the “captured
enemy" lunch guest.

Picnic came off very simply and
honestly due to the mllch (le-
serVi-(l credit of cast, crew, and
the director, Bob Veilni. Also, the
technical effects were a great. asset
to the show. Matthew Murphy's
lighting and sound for the brittle
effects were just right. Even the
waltz numbers lasted Ioilg enough
to create the absurd notion of
dancing during a war. Bob Verini's
direction combined illl these ele-
ments of the show to create a
tongue-in-cheek atmosphere of
trilgi-comeily, llnd then stating the
author's message-that is: the
hardest battle of life to win is
loneliness and iis long as we dream
we have the cllallcc to temimrurily
defeat the enemy.

Working to create this overall
effect were the actors themselves,
who created perfectly believable
characters. ’l‘heir concentration
anti inner energy was sustained
throughout the show. It's hard to
l colnplish this, mueh less keep it.
It was especially seen in the part
of the mother. ller prim and
proper old-world ways compli-
lnented the rest. of the characters.
She added a touch of Burns and
Allen‘like humor with the father
that added to the over-all satire
which was intended. Even the
Stretcher-Bearers (llobin Sagon
and Mary ’l‘ieile) were constantly
energetic as they ran ill and out in
search of wounded and dead.

I enjoyed I’lcrlic because it cre-
ated the illusion of farce and
fanttu withmlt the tedlouu exag-
geration or phony indication that
is sometimes mistaken for theatre.

Michael Lampert. Student Association President

Thousands of resident students
returning to their dormitories this
week from spring vacation have a
surprise in store for them: Money.
SUNY Chancellor Ernest Boyer,
taking the advice of legal council,
has ordered the SUNYA admini-
atration to refund all monies col-
lected from students through a
disputed telephone charge. The
action effects every SUNYA stu-
dent. residing in a dormitory and
climaxes a four month campaign
led by Student Association Presi-
dent Mike Lampert. to have the
money restored to student pock-
ets.

Boyer, in a letter dated March
29th, wrote Lampert that “ar-
rangements will be made to re-
fund the (telephone) charges col-
looted" and that their initial col-
lection was “technically incor.
rect".

The amount of money involved
is thirty dollars per telephone,
divided equally among the
phone's users. Thus, uptown stu-
dents sharing a six man suite stand
to collect five dollars each from
Boyer's action: the amount rises
to fifteen dollars for Alumni Quad
students who double up in rooms.

Assistant Vice~President for
Management and Planning Robert
Stierer said yesterday that most
students will be receiving their
checks by mail. Those students
who currently have a balance due
on their university account will
have the refund applied to that.

Up the Creek

Boyer's actions assumed added
significance because it placed him
at odds with local administrators
here at SUNYA who were op-
posed to returning the funds. All
the ASP reported on March 3rd,
Vice President John Hartley, nct-
ing on verbal "assurances" of
SUNY Central Administration
that the state phone subsidy
would be dropped, ordered il fif-

teen dollar charge added to stu-
dent bills in August and again in
January. The ofﬁcial authoriza-
tion never came and SUNYA stu-
dents found themselves in a
unique position—they were the
only students in the state universi-
ty system paying the additional
money.

Hartley defended his action,
claiming that given the situation
his was the “most logical and
rational decision" and that his
performances “were perfectly in
line with what the Board of Trus-
tees said." He wrote Central Ad-
ministration arguing that the
money should not be refunded
and that his position was “perfect-
ly defensible".

But Lampert countered with
two letters to the Chancellor.
claiming that a similar situation
occurred in Plattsburgh earlier this
year—where the money was re-
funded—and also that Hartley had
no authority to institute the fee in
the ﬁrst place.

Central Administration found it.-
self caught between the two—and
solved the problem by throwing it
in the hands of legal counsel It
was probably the wisest course;
Lampert had pledged to seek Cen-
tral Council permission to sue if
Boyer kept stalling. "In ,terms of
legalities, the Chancellor was up a
creek," he explained.

Wicked Procedure

Yesterday, Lampert was visibly
elated that he had emerged the
victor in the verbal battle and that
now students would be getting
some extra pocket money. "1
clearly think it‘s the right de-
cision," he explained and went on
to add that “to have been the
only campus iii the SUNY system
collecting the fee was plainly ab~
surd." Though Boyer disagreed
that students were entitled to
receive extra interest payments

because the money had been held
some six months, Lampert seemed
unconcerned since “the interest
payments would amount to no-
thing anyway."

John Hartley had a more aub-
dued reaction, noting “We have
been instructed to make the re-
fund and we will do it.” “It's clear
what the reasons behind the' de-
cision were. The (telephone)
charge wasn't applied to the
whole state and the directive
didn’t get out on time."

Students have apparently won
their battle but the fruits of via-
tory may still be along time com-
ing. The refund procedure will be
handled through the Bumar's of-

fice, which is already plagued with
manpower shortages and sizeable
delays. As Lampert observed:

“The implementation of this is

going to be wicked."

Stierer said yesterday that the
entire refundlng process will be
handled through a local deposi-
tory and not the Dormitory ln-
come Fund “which will speed
things up a bit." But he
cautioned: “There is a substantial
amount of paperwork and check-
ing involved so we cannot give a
speciﬁc schedule at this point."

Last year. an Indian Quad room
and board rebate that affected
200 students took one clerk some
eight. weeks to handle. This refund
inVOIVes some 5,000 students so
the delay could be extensive.

Lampert called this arrangement
“clearly unacceptable” and prom-
ised to fight to get students the
refund by the end of the semester

. setting the stage for renewed
controversy. Sticrer said earlier:
“Some students may not. got re-
funds by tho and of this semester"
ilnd one familiar with the work-
ings of the SUNYA bureaucracy
hild to conclude that even that,
perhaps, was an optimistic fore-
cast.
