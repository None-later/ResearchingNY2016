last year's levels, there would have
to be an incrase in board rates,
Zahm noted.

Zahm warns that this no in
crease for board rates “is a one
semester shot. We will have to
wait and see if we can hold the
line for the Spring semester or
whether there will be an incrase
next January." FSA, like every-
one else. is subject to inﬂationarv

said that programs developed by
the Center “will...be interdisci-
plinary and approached in a man
ner by which the student is sys-
tematically exposed to effnrls

study at the center."

The new option offered to qullll

The race is on.

State legislators returned to
Albany Monday, after a 10 day
Easter-Passover recess, planning to
bring this year's session to a close
within two weeks.

They left Albany having passed
Governor Rockefeller‘s
hold-the-line budget with only
minor revisions. The lawmakers
out only about $30 million from
the Governor’s original recom-
mendation of $470 billion. The
budget was thrown out of balance
only a few days after the new
ﬁscal year started by the settle-
ment of the short-lived CSEA
strike. The agreement means that
the state must find a method to
deal with the $80 million dif-
ference that has been created. The
problem of how to re-balnnce the
books along with a variety of
other legislation will be on the
calendars for legislative action.

During the next two weeks, legi-
slators will consider a proposal to
amend the State's consitution in
order to allow casino style gam-
bling in the stoic. If passed, the
measure would not go into effect
earlier than 1973 since the voters

will have to approve the amend-
merit.

Two separate no-feult insurance
bills are also currently being con-
sidered by lawmakers. One
measure, sponsored by Peekskill
Republican Senator Bernard
Gordon and backed by the
Govenor, would provide that
people involved in auto accidents
would receive up to $50,000 for
medical expenses plus $1,000 per
month for 3 years for loss of
earnings after the accident and up
to $5,000 for property damage to
other than the car without having
to go to court to prove fault. The
other measure, sponsored by Sen-
ntor Thomas Laverne
(ll-Rochester) and Senator John
Hughes (R—Syraclne), would allow
$3,000 for medical expenses for
one injured person and a total of
$15,000 for all the victims of one
accident. Under the Gordon plan,
a person could not sue for negli-
gence unless medical expenses ex-
cecdcd the limits, if the accident
occurs out of state or if someone
is killed or severely muimcd or
disfigured. Thc Laverne measure
does not prohibit negligence suits
based on fullll. Both measures
have received shurp criticism from

legislators as well as other groups
including the New York State
Trial Lawyers Association. Charges
that the bills discriminate against
the'black and the poor have also
been leveled by some groups. It is
possible that no no-fault plan will
be approved this year.

Various measures dealing with
prison reform and ways to speed
the judicial process will also be
dealt with in the next two
weeks. A package of bills to re-
form the state's much criticized
pension system is also awaiting
legislative action.

The legislators really do not
have. too much to do, and have
done comparatively little this ses-
sion. This session, often labeled a
“do‘nothing legislature" seems to
be living up to its reputation. The
legislators have usually only found
it necessary to stay in Albany for
three days, and few eloquent
speeches and emotional appeals
have highlighted these short ses-
sions. The basic reasons for this
lack-luster legislature stems from
the fact that two special sessions
were held in December and that
for many lawmakers this is an

Constitution for Student Workers

The FSA student Workers Organization, the ﬂedgling student
workers union, held a meeting March 22, during which their
proposed constitution was read and discussed.

The meeting was well-attended, and interest in the union
appears to be running high. Copies of the constitution are
available in all campus. kitchens, and those workers who have not
already signed it are urged to.

The FSA Student Workers Organization is potentially the single
most powerful student group on campus; by representing student
opinion to FSA management it will benefit not only student
workers, but certainly all SUNYA students as well.

Common Cause Tonight
A leading organizer of Common Cause a national citizens group,
will be speaking here Tuesday, April 11. 8:00 p.m. in LG 18. The
following is a statement of explanation by one of SUNYA's
student Common Cause members, Larry Schlcifer:

“Don‘t just sit [hero and complain. Let's do something to
rebuild America,"

With these words. Common Cause, the citizens group, is asking
your help to turn Amcl‘icrl around. To this and Common Cuusc's
Atlantic Regional Coordinator, Robert S. Colodzin, is holding a
meeting on Tuesday, April II, 8:00 p.m. in LC 18.

Common Cause is ll nlltlonul non-partisan group with over
200,000 members lobbying in the public interest at llll levels of
government. Common Cause is concerned with issues—not politi-
cal parties or cundidntcs. The major issues with which Common
Cruise is concerned are:

“...to overhaul llnrl rcvilulizc our governcmnt institutions...to
withdraw Americun forces from lndochinu...to provide equal
opportunity for llll...l.o preserve the cnvironmenl....to eliminate
poverty...Lo provirlc everyone with decent housing...to improve
our education system...l.o provide necessary job skills...to overhaul
our health system...to protect the consumer...to plan carefully for
population growth...to sustain economic growth...to achieve more
effective ways of dealing with luwlessness...to improve urban
transportation."

Common Cause considcrcs the new youth and student vote a
potentially decisive force in the fall elections. But to transform
the voice of the newly enfrnnclliscd into ll unified force will
rcquircI cxtcnsivc orglmizutionlll experience. At. the meeting this
Tuesday, Common Cause will provide the organizational ex-
pcricncc to lay the groundwork for the formation of a “New
Voter's Lobby.” Common Cause believes that the “New Voter’s
Lobby" will be an excellent way for the newly enfrnnchiscd to gel.
involved and participate in the political process.
