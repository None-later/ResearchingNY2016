THIS YEAR 'I'WA OFFERS S'I'UTELPASS.

If you‘re planning to go to Europe this summer.
don‘t be surprised if you find yourself sleeping in
an uncomfortable place.

With more students than ever planning to take
advantage of low airfares, decent sleeping accom-
modations are going to be tough to get.

Not that back-packing it isn't fun. But after a
while the ground starts getting kind of hard.

You could play it safe and make reservations
long in advance. But that can take all the fun out
of traveling, since you may want to stay longer in
one place, less in another, or change your plans
altogether. ’

That's why TWA has come out with Stutelpass.‘

For only $4.80 a day. you get a decent place to
sleep. continental breakfasts. tour discounts.
mail-drop services and more.

Stutelpass works like this.

When you purchase your TWA tickets. you can
also purchase the Stuteipass for 20, 40. or 60 days.
At only $4.80 a day.

The Stutelpass booklet contains 20 vouchers.
which can be used every day or every few days.
In any 50 cities serviced by Stutelpass. If you
don't use them all. just return them for a refund.

All you have to do in Europe is either phone or
visit any one of 12 Stutelpass offices before 3 PM.
'Ihll them where you want to go and they'll arrange
everything.

When you get to the esthouse or student
hotel, just hand them t e voucher.

There's nothing more to do.

No taxes to pay.

No service charges to pay.

No advance reservations to make.

And for every 20 vouchers you buy TWA throws
in 6 special vouchers. Which can be used for
tickets to a play in London. the use of a bicycle
in Amsterdam. tickets to a bullfight in Spain, a
three-course meal in Venice. tickets to the Olympia
Music Hall in Paris. a smorgasbord luncheon
in Copenhagen and more.

All this for $4.80 a day.

’l‘WA‘s Stutelpass.

Now you don't have to worry about finding a
decent place to sleep.

.In December. the lawmakers
met first to decide upon a newly
reapportioned map for the state
and then met again later to help
make up the state’s_ huge
1971-1972 deﬁcit by passing new
taxes on alcohol, pauline and
cigarettes. Rockefeller’s vow to
stick to a no growth budget this
year eliminated the chance for
much don-r “main. and heated
debate as evidenced by the smal-
lest cuts in the budget in many
years as well as a quick vote of
approval with much bi-psrtisan
support. The hold-the-Iine budget
plus the tax hike voted in Decem-
ber meant that the vote conscious
legislators would not have to even
speak about more money from
the people with only about 6
months left until election day.

So the race is on to close the
session so many legislators can
return home to hit the campaign
trail and enter yet another race;
the race for votes.
