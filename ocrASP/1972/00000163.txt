was a calculate'di show of strength by President
Nixon. None of the bombers was reported hit in the
strike, but continued 352 strikes would run avhlgh
risk that one or more of America’s mightiest

' bombers may be shot down.

President Nguyen Van 'i'hleu also was running a
major calculated risk, the commitment of two
regiments of infantry from the Mekong Delta to the
current worst trouble spot, the siege of An Loc, a
provincial capital 60 miles north of Saigon where
10,000 government troops are surrounded by a far
larger enemy force. Fighting in this sector, however,
had tapered off enough that helicopters could take
in supplies. The two Delta regiments are part of a
20,000-man government force pushing up Highway
13, the main route into the region from Saigon. The
column reported little ﬁghting and little progress
toward An Loc.

The Mekong Delta was comparatiVely quiet but
vulnerable to a major enemy push, with the loss of
two regiments of the govemment’s better troops. As
in past days, there were scattered hit-and-run
attacks in the lush rice land of the Delta south of
Saigon.

U.S. ofﬁcials, in attempting to evaluate the pluses
and minuses of Hanoi‘s second largest offensive of
the war, said a standoff appeared to be in effect at
the moment. Although North Vietnamese divisions,
in the early days of the offensive across the DMZ
collapsed the government's northern defensive tier,
they have been unable to follow up this success.

Saigon has heavily reinforced both the northern
front, which begins about 10 miles south of the
DMZ, and the area south of An Loc along Highway
13.

Casualties in the current fighting are said to be
heavy on both sides. The government, however, has
refused to give over-all casualty ﬁgures.

The U.S. Command said three Americans have
died, 23 are missing and 10 have been wounded
since the start of the offensive. Also, 19 U.S.
aircraft have been lost.

A key factor in the northern ﬁghting has been that

I for the ﬁrst time in the war, the enemy was engaged

in almost wholly conventional ﬁghting, not only
with tanks and massed infantry formations, but

r"“ ‘ 4  ‘t unils,’ '4‘ _, at least
one SAM battery. A SAM earlier slightly damaged a
862 in a raid just south of the DMZ.

That incident served to highlight the danger for
the giant bombers over almost any major North
Vietnamese target. Hanoi has vastly strengthened its
antialrcraft defenses since the United States called a
halt to the bombing in the North in 1968. Air
Force ofﬁcials said in the past the 8525 simply
could not survive against SAMs since they could not
twist and turn the way more mancuverable fighter
bombers can.

The U.S. Command would not discuss details of
the Vinh attack, but North Vietnam said the attack
began in the pro-dawn hours with waves of attacking
planes.

 

The command acknowledged that while U.S.
troop strength inside Vietnam continued to dwin-
dle, down 5,500 to 90,000 in the last reporting
period, it was swelling outside the country. The 7th
Fleet picked up at least 3,000 men last week as
more ships steamed into Vietnamese waters.

All of Indochina Feels BrunlL of War

NEW YORK (LNS) — During
the last month, liberation forces
throughout Indochina have
stepped up the pace of their mili-
tary struggle against U.S. support-
ed governments and troops. In
mid-March rebel forces in Laos
seized control of the CIA intelli-
gence base of Sam Thong, about
90 miles north of the Laotian
capital of Vientiane.

Since then there has been in.
tense ﬁghting around the nearby
major CIA base of Long Chieng.
Rebel forces threatened to seize
the base in January but were
driven back. Should they be suc-
cessful in capturing Long Chieng
this time, that would leave no
organized defense line between
the rebels and Vientiane. The
guerrillas have also gained control
of Highway 13 between Vientiane
and the royal capital of Luang
Prabang.

Although U.S. strategists had
predicted that the NLF would
launch a major Tet offensive this
year in South Vietnam, it did not
occur. "We don't have a habit of
informing the U.S. military com-
mand of what we are doing and
what we will do," a PRG spokes-
man in Paris explained, and said
that “recently the U.S. udminis~
trntion has made very noisy prop-
aganda about the "imminent of-
fensive by the Liberation Armed
Forces as a pretext to concentrate
more aircraft carriers and 352‘s,
as a pretext to justify the escala-
tion of the airwar."

In the ﬁrst 10 days of March,
Hanoi reports over 300 sorties
were flown over North Vietnam,
attacking primarin civilian tar-
gets. During the same period, 6 of
these planes were shot down. Be-
fore March was half over, the
number of U.S. air strikes against
North Vietnam had cquullcd the
total number during the entire
year of 1971, the New York
Times reported on March 9. On
March 8, U.S. ofﬁcials In Saigon
announced that henceforth there

full-scale bombing of North Viet-

In a report issued March 15th
by Vietnam News Agency in
Hanoi, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the PRC of South
Vietnam issued the following
statement:

"Since early March, 1972, the
U.S. has sent their 8-52 strategic

0.5. Policy

ITHACA, N.Y. (LNS)—The U.S.
government calls its Vietnamese
policy one of "urbanization "
Critics say it is genocide. As the
air war in Indochina increases in
intensity and civilian casualties
mount, it is more and more evi-
dent that the systematic destruc-
tion of the rural population of
Vietnam is the essence of Ameri-
can strategy. So reports Gary
Porter, a researcher who has seen
parts of a multi-volume, secret
study by the Rand Corporation
which, according to Porter, pro-
vidcs the most detailed evidence
of U.S. war crimes in Vietnam
thus far.

Scholars have tried unsuccessful-
ly for years to get the study
declassiﬁed. “Small wonder," says
Porter. “...Thcsc volumes are the
U.S. equivalent of the German
archives which provided the Allies
with their evidence of German
war crimes."

In Interviews conducted from
19615-67, with Vietnamese victims
of bombing and shelling. the Rand
study substantiates the Indlscrlmi-
mite bombings of villages, the

“Hundreds of U.S. aircraft re
peatedly bombed and sfrafed
many densely populated areas in
Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang
Binh provinces and the Vinh Linh
area of the DRV, killing or injur-
ing many civilians, mostly women,
children and old people. "

Meanwhile in" Paris, U.S. dale
gate William Porter announced
March 24 that beﬁwas postponing
the talks indeﬁnitely, because, he
said, the DRV and PEG refused to
involve themselves in what he
called “serious discussions."-

The fact that ‘the U.S. has effec-
tively scuttled the Paris Peace

deliberate and systematic destruc-

allows for no distinction between
combatants and civilians. These
acts clearly violate the Hague Con-
vention and the Geneva Conven-
tion of 1949. Incidents such as
My Lai are not isolated cases of
brutality, but are representative of
the U.S. policy.

A refugee from qung Sac Vil-

June 1965 that “my village was
attacked by napalm as well as by
shell bombs...Wc were neither

lery shelling. This year, from
January to May, we were attacked
by aircraft 7 times. These attacks
killed only one guerrilla, but
killcd many women and children.
We were most afraid of the air-
craft bombing—that is why vIl-

Axelrod Promoted; Gets Chairmanship

by Vicki Zeldin
Capital Correspondent

Dr. Donald Axelrod, full pro-
fessor of public administution, has
been appointed to the chair—
manship of the department of
Public Administration, effective
July 1, 1972, for a three year
term.

Axelrod was hired as a full
professor at SUNYA on a three
year contract beginning in April
of 1971, with a salary of $28,200
a year. Axelrod retired from a
statejob as assistant deputy direc-
tor of the budget some two years
ago. He receives a state pension of
$19,000 for his 84 years ofsorvicc
to the state. In total, the professor
receives $47,200 from the state of
New York.

In his new post as department
chairman, Axelrod will not receive
any additional salary or fringe
beneﬁts according to Dean of tho

 

Graduate School of Public Affairs,
Gray Cowan. In fact, according to
the dean, he will be working
harder than before. Cowan stated,
“We are fortunate to get Axelrod
to take this on...it’s kind of a
labor of love..." Several other
professors were interviewed for
the position, but none of them
wanted it according to a faculty
member who had been consi-
dered. When questioned why he
took the chairmanship which
would mean more work for the
same pay, Axelrod stated, “I
think that the Graduate School of
Public Affairs Is an exciting and
dynamic place to work."

Axelrod comes to SUNYA hav-
ing done graduate work at Colum-
bia and receiving a PhD from
Syracuse University. He has lec-
tured at a variety of colleges
Including Cornell and Berkeley.
Axolrod Is the author of several

articles and has co-authorcd two

books all in the field of Public

Administration. He has never held

a full time university level teach-

ing position before coming to

Albany in September.

Axelrod defended his lack of
teaching experience by stating
that a department of the GSI‘A'S
nature should have a mix of
“...not only academicians but also
people with practical exper-
ionce..." Dean Cowan stated that
Axelrod had been appointed "be-
cause of his recognized authority
on budgets and finance and his
academic background."

According to Cowan, Axelrod
was reccommended as first choice
for the position by a committee
consisting of the entire faculty of
the Public Administration Depart-
ment. The student advisory com-
mittee in the department also
recommended Axelrod for the po-

sition. Orville F. Poland, currently
chairman of the department, has
held the post for 5% years, and
will now return to teaching.
Axelrod was hired without ten-
ure, as is the case with most
professors. He will come up for
tenure review while he is serving
as department chairman, but it is
not known If his position will
affect the decision. Axelrod stress-
ed that tenure decisions were
made on a university-wide level
and not just by the individual
departments. In an earlier inter-
view, Poland, the current depart-
ment hcad, stated, that because of
Axclrod's lack of teaching expor-
ienco he had been hired “with the
understanding that he would not
receive tenure." However, accord-
Ing to the school's dean, Axelrod
was Irlred with tenure, because, “a
man of his caliber could not be
expected to come any other

way."

When questioned about the dif-
ference in answers concerning Ax-
elrod‘s tenure status, Chairman
Poland stated that the dean must
have simply made a mistake. Po-
land stated that earlier this year a
decision had been made to not
grant incoming faculty tenure un-
less there were rather extenuating
circumstances. As to whether Ax-
elrod‘s position as chairman
would serve to enrich his chances
of receiving tenure, Poland stated
that it would be unlikely although
he did state, "admittedly it is
awkward to have a chairman with‘
out tenure." Poland stated that
"upwards to 50%" of the Public
Administration faculty have come
to the department having had
outside professional experience.
He did admit howeVer, that very
few members of the faculty who
