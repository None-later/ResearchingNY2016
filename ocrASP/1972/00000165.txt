Racial Trouble Flares at Coblcskill

by Frank Kollirch, Jr.
Editor-ln—Chlet
Coblasklll Student Press

Apathy died at l:45 am, Wednes-
day April 12, 1972, when a large
cross was ignited in front of a
predominantly Black wing of
Vroman Hall at SUNY Cobleskill.
A rock thrown through a window
caused a Black resident to catch
sight of the cross and thrust
Cobleskill into state wide recogni-
tion.

The result was an estimated
$10,000 damage, done to the ad
ministration buildibg, two dining
halls, and two resident halls, ac-
cording to Dr. Walton A. Brown,
President of SUNY Cobleskill.
The administration building is
clad in large mirror finished palte
glass windows and roughly ten
were broken, most of the office
equipment on the ﬁrst floor was
overturned. In the dining halls and
resident halls several windows
were vroken, plus car windows
were smashed.

Causes

When questioned about the un-
derlying c iuses of the disturbance,
Mr. Douglai. Long, Student Activi-
ties Director, replied, “It's pos-
sible to check-off a list that‘s a
few years old." As of this aca-
demic year, the causes of tension
are many; during intramural bas-
ketball season the high competi-
tive spirit caused skirmishes be-
tween Blacks and Whites, several
faculty members resigning. an of
leged attack of a White girl and
the subsequent conviction of a
Black girl, the fruitless search for
a Black cultural center, the fights
provoked by both in town and on
campus by the use of certain

phrases to denote dislike, requests
by the EOP advisory board and
Blacks for larger enrollments, the
resignation of the BOP director,
Mr. William Washington, the dis-
approval of 24 hour open dorms,
the closeness of finals and gradua-
tion plus the difference between
other campus centers and Cable-
skill with student resentment of
the difference. Then, Monday, du-
ring the noon meal hour, a fight
broke out between Blacks and
Whites. The alleged cause is said
to be monetary debt. That after—
noon people hecame fearful that
trouble would begin anew.

After the destruction, caused by
both Blacks and Whites, the Black
students gathered in the lounge of
Dix Hall, a dorm where most of
the Black co-cds are housed. Al-
though all trafﬁc stopped in the
dorm, it was not by force but
rather by fright. Meanwhile, the
Black students set up a discussion
center.

Aftermath

While the administration start-
ed picking up the pieces, law
enforcement officers from the
State, County and 'I‘won arrived
and students learned of th
mornings trouble.

As students started for classes,
conferences were being con-
ducted in the administration
building between Dr. Brown
am! the campus fraternities,
who allegedly bad a strong band
in causing the trouble.

In the Dix Hall lounge, the
Black students explained what

had happened and expressed
their fears that total blame and
total retaliation would be aimed
at them. Once again they re-
quested larger enrollment of
Blacks and a fair and impartial
investigation. As of this time no
person has been arrested al-
though students have placed the
blame on one or the other racial
group.

Tensions sky-rocketed and the
appearance of the Black stu-
dents, journeyingin mass from
Dix Hail to the Dining Hall for
lunch, added to the already
confused and frightened state of
the campus community.

Outdoor Day

Wednesday was an out-doors

day, which brought hundreds of
students out to discuss what
had happened and what might
occur that night. Outwardly,
the campus returned to normal
but some began arming for fur-
ther action, and the state troop-
ers were outside of the campus
observing people coming to
Cohleskill. Towards the after-
noon, lead pipes and wine began
appeari ng on the campus scene,
and people were traveling in
groups.

N ews S pread

The news of the incident
spread across the state and par-
ents began pulling the students
home, while the administration

sent others home. Even next
year’s applicants were being
sent back to their home com-
munities even before their arriv-
al. Statements were issued to
the media and the campus radio
station, WCOB, was “rcqucst~
ed" to read an official state-
ment.

Foreboding

During the night and UHF!)
morning while students gatli
ered in groups for protection,
the Black students once again
met in Dix Hall where thm
remained awake all night, t'i-in-
ful that something further
would happen, hoping, and [His

entire campus, that nothing

had primarily administrative back-
grounds had come in at Axelrod‘s
age and rank.

Axelrod has been the subject of
several newspaper stories done
both by the ASP and the local
media because of his seemingly
high salary and his pension bene-
ﬁts both of which come from the
state coffers. Axelrod stressed
that part of the money he receives
from his pension came out of his
own pocket since he contributed
towards it. Dean Cownn stated
that Axelrod's salary was “to-
wards the higher end of the aver-
age" within the department.

A large number of bills have
been introduced in the legislature
to reform the state's costly pen-
sion system. Some of the legis-
lation would prohibit people from

collecting large pensions while al-
so working for the state in ano-
ther capacity after retirement.
Such legislation has been intro-
duced in the Assembly by Amster-
dam Democrat Mary Ann Krup-
ask, and in the Senate by Albany
Republican Walter Langley. When
asked to comment on the Axelrod
appointment, Krupsak stated, "he
is one of the kind of individuals
that are beneﬁciaries of special
privilege legislation...it is unjusti~
tied..." Krupsak continued that
she was pleased that the leaders in
the legislature seemed to be mov-
ing towards pension reforms.

Fighting Intensifies in Vietnam

North Viets Push Bock American Forces

SAIGON AP -

Waves of U.S. bombers carpeted
the An Loc battlefield with fire
and explosives Thursday, trying to
smash enemy assaults that cap-
tured part of the provincial capital
north of Saigon. The government
troops there were surrounded and
in danger of being overrun.

"There's a perimeter on the
southern edge of town That's
about the only friendly place in
this whole country up here," a
U.S. pilot ﬂying over the battle-
ground radioed.

Enemy troops and tanks, ap-
parently at the price of heavy
losses, braved all the bombs, but-
lets, and shells that could be
brought to bear on them and
drove deep into the town, (50
miles north of Saigon. Field re-
ports said thcy also captured a
nearby airfield, making resupply
and minforcomentol' the l2,000
government troops, or what was
left of them, extremely hazar~
(lous.

About 30,000 North Vietna-
mesc troops are reported commit-
led to the battle just south of the
Cambodian border. Earlier they
seized two nearby district head-
‘luartcrs.

High Point of Offensive

For the North Vietnamese, the
rupture of a provincial capital
would be the high poinl so far in

their 15-day-old offensive. Pres-
ident Nguyen van Thieu has or-
dered An Loc held at all costs,
fearful of the effect the town's
capture would have on the morale
of his soldiers and civilians loyal
to his regime.

Fifteen miles to the south of- An
Loc a 20,000-man armor and in-
fantry rescue force remained

' stalled in the face of enemy fire.

Commanders said they could not
advance because of enemy resist-
ance, a factor totally disregarded
by the enemy just to the north.
One U.S. adviser voiced impa-
tience with the government com-
manders, saying: “I wonder why
we stay bogged down here.

the situation deteriorated
hourly, some quarters in Saigon
expressed belief the senior U.S.:
adviser in the region had underest-
imated the enemy, something the
allies often have done in the past.
SAIGON AP -

Wednesday » All available air-
power was thrown into the battle
Thursday in the hope that aerial
bombardment would prevent (le-
feat.

U.S. pilots, in exchanges of radiv
o conversations, told of bombing
factories and a village near An
Loc.

There were no reports on num—
bers of casualties on either side.
They were exptceted to be high,

Key Battle of War

Militarily, An Loc has little sig-
nificance, but if the defenders are
overwhelmed it could be the
worst single disaster of the war for
Saigon's forces.

Military sources said the in-
creased attacks and their fury
indicated the Communist
command has opened a new phase
of their lS-day-old general
offensive, their second greatest of
the war. Intelligence had predic-
ted this all along. In view of this,
the sources said, Saigon itself may
be the target of rocket attacks.
Military sources said the North
Vietnamese have movedmost of
an estimated 30,000-man force
from northern Cambodia and
southern Laos across the border
into South Vietnam‘s vulnerable
central highlands.

Fighting continued around Fire
Base Bastogne, guarding the
southwestern approaches to llue
12 miles from the city and 65
miles south of the DMZ. The
senior U.S. officer said that the
fall of Bastogne would be a lacti—
cal military setback because the
enemy would be within range to
shell line with 130mm artillery,
which has a range of 17 miles. The
psychological impact, howevrr,
would be great if the enemy be—
gins shelling the ancient imperial
capital.

 

WASHINGTON AP - American
ofﬁcials are expecting the North
Vietnamese “to take a swipe" at
the ancient imperial capital of
Hue in the next few days, an
attack viewad asa major test of
President Nixon's Vietnamization
program.‘

Predicting a real battle between
the North Vietnamese 324th Divi-
sion in league with elements of
the 304th and the lat South
Vietnamese Divisions, one mili-
tary expert said the fighting “will
be the final examination of Viet-
namization."

The officials said the 1st Divi-
sion is the best in South Viet-
nam’s Army and they point out
the unit has not been committed
to battle in the current fighting,
leaving it ready to go.

One source, citing captured
North Vietnamese documents and
testimony from prisoners, says
Hanoi hopes to capture liue and
other cities in an effort to incite a
countryside uprising, undermin
the Saigon government and play
on anti-war sentiments within the
United Slates.

Shaping Up

members said Thursday the U.S.
government appears to be re-esca-
lating American involvement in
the war.

“If news reports are accurate,
our country is now assembling in
Asia one of the largest air armadas
in military history," they said in a
letter to President Nixon. The
Members of Congress for Peace
Through Law asked Nixon in the
letter for a full report on the site,
purpose and cost of contemplated
U.S. military action in Indochina.

The American position would be
affected enormously by a battle
for Hue.

Failure to hold the city ‘would
dangerously weaken defense lines
in the northern sector and open to
attack the American air base at
Phu Bai, just south of Hue.

Moreover, the failure of Saigon’s
best troops could indicate South
Vietnam is not able to defend
itself and, therefore, the failure of
Nixon‘s program of troop with-
drawals and ultimate reduction of
U.S. military involvement, If the
base at I’hu Bai were endangered,
its defense probably would in
crease the U.S. combat casualty
rate and refocus American public
attention on the American involv-
ement. American reinforcements
were flown to Phu Bai Wednes-
ay.

Paris (APl—The chief of the US.

tnlks revealed today that President
Nixon made a secret proposal to
the Vietnamese Communists to
resume the talks today.

"The only response came in the
form of a mushrooming invasion
of the Republic of South Vietnam
by North Vietnamese troops.

Ambassador William J. Porter
told an airport. news conference as
he relurnod from consultations in

Nixon made his secret proposal
“through a private channel“ on
April 1, Porter said, and the Com-
munist side received it the next
day. The proposal thus was made
two days after the first effect of
the big North Vietnamese offeri-
sivc below the demilitarized zone
was felt. rI‘he South Vietnamese
on March 30 were drivon from the
first of the string of border bases

Porter gave no clue to the identi-

(APl—Sen, George McGovern
says he‘s an underdog in Massa-
chusetts but hopes to improve his
organization enough to defeat
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie in the
April 25 Democratic presidential
primary.

McGovern, speaking to ncwsmen
iit Boston's Logan International
Airport as he began his Massachu-
setts primary campaign Wednes-
day, said: "Our organization is
not as strong as it should be at
this point, but it is coming into

Muskie, meanwhile, told six
Democratic state officials in Bos-
ton he will campaign “as much as
is needed to win" in Massachu~
setts. The six officials are heading
Muskic's delegate slate in the

Scottsdale, Ariz. (APl—The na-
tion should treat drug abuse like
unemployment and aim at keep-
ing it as low as possible, says
Raymond P. Shaft-r, head of the
National Commission on Muri-
juana and Drug Abuse.

"We generally discuss drug abuse
in terms of elimination," Shafer
said Wednesday. "It may be that
the misuse of drugs is not. subject
to total elimination. Therefore, it.
might be useful to regard drug
abuse as we do unemployment,
making a judgment that social
policy should aim to keep drug
abuse to an irreducible mini-
mum."

Shafor, the former Pennsylvania
governor, was the keynote speaker
at the American Medical Associa-

tion's 18th annual conference of
state mental hcluth representat-
ives.

He called on the AMA repre-
sentativos to reassess the drug
