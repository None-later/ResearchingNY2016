A measure that would require all
students. with some exceptions,
to live in state owned dormitories
is being considered for intro-
duction by Anemny Majority
Leader John Kin'ton.

According to the Long Island
lawmaker's legal counsel, James
Catterson Jr., the bill was prompt-
ed because of “...pure and simple
economics..." He cited a news
story from Stony Brook indies;

off campus. Catterson stated that
there would be 6,000 empty dorm
beds in the SUNY system next
year. He claimed that 2,000 of
these spaces could be absorbed by
administrative ofﬁces. Empty
dorm beds 'mean that the state
loses the money paid for rent. and
consequently the state must pro-
vide funds to pay off the dor-
mitory bonds that the rent would
normally cover.

Construction Costs Rise

Catterson also noted the rising
cost of construction as a factor
influencing the framing of the bill.
He claimed that original estimates
for the cost per bed were $6,000,
but the actual costs had exceeded
this amount in some cases by
$2,500 and by as much as an
additional $4,000 in other instan-
ces. Catterson stated that con
struction costs in New York from
l967-70 had increased 40%.

The measure, which is being
allowed to "mature for awhile,"
according to Catterson, would re-
quire all students in full time
attendance at a SUNY school to
live in a dormitory unit except
married students, students living
with parents, or their immediate
family, students who have shown
good cause why they should not
live in dorms and have been grant-
cd permission to live elsewhere by
their chief administrative officer,
or his dcsigncc, of the institution,

When it was pointed out that
the measure did little more than
to restate the SUNY Trustees
guideline for off-campus living,
and that it was quite possible that
even if this legislation was passed
the State might find itself in the
same situation as it is now.
Catterson stated that the measure
would be “regressive if it were too
strong..."

Some Exceptions

Current SUNY guidelines are
actually more stringent than the
provisions of the Kinpton mea-
sure. Only married students, stu-
dents living with their parents or
students who have persmission of
their institution's chief admini-
strative officer may live off-cam-
pus. In most instances, however,
no Eudents have ever asked the
permission of the administration
to live off-campus. Most recently,
though, acting SUNY Binghamton
President Gordon informed stu-
dents that all freshmen and trans-
fer students coming in next year
would be required to live on
campus.

Binghamton has been faced this
year with the possibility of having
to close several dorm units as well
as cafeteria space because students
have chosen to live off-campus.

Binghamton is not alone in its
problem, because as mentioned
earlier, Stony Brook also faces the
pombility of having to close dorm
units. Albany has also been hit by

"Common Cause" Speaker Cites
Need for Student Membership

By Mitchell Zoier

Common Cause, a citizens
group, held an organizational
meeting for its Albany area mem-
bers in LC 18, Tuesday evening.
Robert Colorlzin, political and
media expert who is now an assis-
tant director of Common Cause in
charge of five northeastern states,
coordinated and was the principal
speaker at the meeting. Although
the majority of the audience al-
ready belonged to the organi-
zation, Colodzin reiterated the
group‘s goals, accomplishments,
and structure.

"How to Vote"

He described Common Cause as
“...how to vote between
elections." This isdone through
the main thrust of Common
Causc’s energies, lobbying both in
Washington and the state capitals
(although the main emphasis is on
the national level). At the mo-
ment they are primarily lobbying
for less secrecy in government and
a program to completely rcveul
campaign funding. When one per-
son asked about whut the organi-
zation was doing in the areas of
Vietnam, family planning and o‘
thor “gut. issues," Colorl'rin replied
that Common Cause considered
sccrccy to he the gut issue, and
snid that this had to be eliminated
before work on the othch could
be attempted. Colorlzin also noted
that Common Cause takes respon-
sibility for spearheading the
“eighteen year old vote" nmcnd—
ment and is now concentrating on
a campaign monitoring progrnm
for the upcoming elections.

in regard to structure, Colorlzin
emphasized that Common Cause

“Programs for Master’s degrees
in New York grew rapidly in
numbers during the decade of the
1960’s. This growth was not
thoughtfully planned and con-
trolled on a State-wide basis, and
was notably undisciplined within
the State-supported universitics
and colleges."

This charge, along with claims of
poor administration of graduate
programs lending to unnecessary
duplication of programs and wide
Variability in standards for faculty
and student performance, was
lcvclcd in a study conducted by
the State Education Department
entitled “Master's Degrees In the
State of New York 1969-70."

The report charged that ncrr
dcmic counseling for graduate stu-
dents was weak, unqualified were
often assigned to graduate
teaching and undergraduate
courses were often taken for grad-
uate credit. More careful screening
of undergra luntes taking graduate
courses was urged and “The ad-
mission of graduate student”. into
undergraduate courses should not
be permitted except under excr-p-
tionnl circumstances."

The 90 page study was es-
pecially critical of the emphasis
placed on graduate programs in
education, primarily to accom-
modate teachers woo are seeking
the required number of hours of
graduate education to obtain pcr-
muncnt certification.The report,
recommended that standards for
permanent certiﬁcation of cle»
mentary and secondary school
staff be based on demonstrated
competence in the classroom. in
addition, it was recommended
that master's programs be made
independent of professional certi-
ficntion.

Review of existing programs in
order to weed out unnecessary,
and inr-ffectivo programs was rc-
commcnded by the study. it was
suggested that “regional co»
opcrntivc approaches among insil
tutions could strengthen graduate
programs." in addition, the report
recommends that the Regents do
not permit institutions not now
offering graduate programs to ho-
gin new programs “unless the
circumstances are mosl unusual"
or the grnduntc progrnm is u co-
opcrniivc effort.

i.cr‘s dogrccs in the state, criticier

grees that are awarded. It was
recommended that new academic
curricula lead only to a master’s
of arts degree, and that new pro-
fessional curricula lead only to a
degree of master of professional
science.

Discussions with students in
master's degree programs revealed
that most students were part-time
and usually had practical interests
and goals quite speciﬁcally occu-
pational. Students, especially
non-matriculnnts, suffered from
poor advisement, mediocre
teaching and very conventional
courses according to the report.
Despite this, the report found that
most students would rather "sit
back" than try to change their
situation. The report concluded,
“It would seem that an attitude of
collusive mediocrity has been
adopted among students, faculty
and administrators at the Master's
level." The type of student ad-
mitted to a master’s program
varied according to the insti-
tution, Those with the best aca-
demic nvcrngcs enrolled in sem-
innrics; those entering the four
year SUNY university centers and
the seven pmate universities came
next, closely followed by those in
the six specialized and technical
schools. Significantly below the
slate-wide average were the grad-
untc students at CUNY, the six—
tccn private colleges, and in the
six SUNY colleges surveyed.

It was found that students on-
rolled in Master’s programs at
schools offering doctorate degrees
had better resources than a stu-
dent cnrollcd in a school that
offered a master's as a terminal
dcgrce. However, students at
schools that also offered doc-
torntcs “May ﬁnd that the re
search interests of the institution
are more compatible with the
professional goals of doctoral cnn-
didutcs, to the point that he is
sometimes a second-class citizen
seeking a credential that is ques-
tionable in this setting." Schools
offering both a doctorate and a
masters were often found to have
11 well organized doctoral program
at the expense of a loosely struc-
tured master's program.

Master's programs at the SUNY
colleges were sharply criticized as
presenting "the least sutisfnctory
evidence of thoughtfulplnnning.”
Theses prepared by master's cun-
didntcs who attended SUNY col-
lagen were judged “...s|ight, badly
planned, and badly written."

“Programs for Masters degrees in New Vork...wero not thoughtfully planned and controlled on s
State-wide basis, and were muddy undisciplined within the state-supported universities and colleges,"
charged a recent report of a study made by the State Education Department.

that teachers belonging to the
graduate faculty must hold either
a doctoral degree or iis equivalent,
and are expected to be actively
engaged in research. SUNY univer-
sity centers, CUNY and the major
private universities adhered to this
stipulation for the most part.
However, the report severely criti-
cized the SUNY colleges in this
regard. “...it is fair to state that in
these institutions anyone who is
judged by his department to be
well-informed in a special ﬁeld is
permitted to touch graduate
courses in it, no matter what his
formal academic credentials and
cxpericncc may bk.“ The report
also stated that "The majority of

faculty members in the units of
both public university systems...
had published work to their
credit, but on the whole the quan-
tity and quality was below that of
their counterparts in the major
private universities."

Particularly hard hit were
teachers at the SUNY colleges.
'l‘-rming most of the publications
on the average in quantity and
quality “disappointing,” the re-
port pointed out that most
faculty at tlwsc schools had only
published in local journals and
spoken bcforc locnl civic groups.
The report stated, “While these
less prominent activities provide a
valuable public service, they do

not represent the kind of research

at the forefront of knowledge that
graduate institutions are expected
to produce." The study con-
cluded, “Certainly some Master's
programs offered in this group
(SUNY Colleges) have been ini-
tiated, under pressure of the need
to expand public facilities, with
too little regard for the scholarly
strength of those teachers assigned
to participate."

The lack of independent study
projects, ﬁeld work, seminars and
small group tutorials, and other
innovative and challenging course
work in many of the Master's
programs studied was also criti-
cized by the report.
