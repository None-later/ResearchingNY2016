Art Dept.
in Crisis

To all Art Dept. Members:

The events of Friday. March 24,
and Monday, March 27, have pre-
CiPitated a crisis in the Art De—
partment which calls for a better
understanding of what must be
done to continue a high quality
visual arts program in the midst of
austerity budgets. In order to re-
soivc some issues quickly and be-
fore rumor and confusion allows
the conditions to seriously
worsen, the Art Department is
calling for a meeting with the
administration. To get at this as
soon as possible, the meeting is set
for Friday afternoon, April 14, in
Fine Arts 126 at 2 pm. While the
meeting is intended for art faculty
and students and administration
members, the chairmen from mu-
sic and theatre will also be invited,
as what is said at this meeting
could very well have the greatest
impact on the future of all the
arts at this University.

There are a number of issues
which must. be met. These in-
clude:

l. The desirability of ii liib fee to
partially support areas where sup“
port is desperately needed but
denied by the University budget.
Questions have been raised regard
ing the right of the department to
authorize such fees to sustain its
own program. It is clear that
stutlans do not favor ii lab fee.
We must examine and understand
iiltcrniitchs.

2. The suggestion has been made
that. shops should be closed unless
supervised. This of course goes
immediately back to money. The
department is on record in every
ofﬁce of the University its favor-
ing maximum student access to
working areas. The present policy
is 7am to 11 pm every day of the
year (including Christmas and
Easter). if liability or higher poli-
cy requires certiﬁed supervision,
then an immediate and careful
reassessment of all shop hours
must be made.

3. The budget itself. We have
provided cost per student per
course estimates. We have provi~
(led an analysis based on faculty
salary and income from tuition.
Wi- liiivu shown that the art de-
piirlini-iil serves a great miitiy slu-
dciils considering the number of
art faculty. Should other depart-
ments- he asked to provide similar
jiisliﬁeiitioii'.’ Wliiil. is needed to
bring about iniprovenicul‘.’

-l. (iriiduiile assistants, The art
(It‘lllll‘llnt'lll has two regular gi'iidu~
ale assistants. if more gi'iiduiili-
ilkﬁ'lslillllﬁ roultl be assigned to the
department, it might serve to pro-
vide supervision for [lie shops and
much needed eiiiploymi-iit for
graduates iii the same time. A few
years ago we examined the griidu~
iite assistant situation, lliiil is.
when We Were told we couldn't
llllVI' iiiiy graduate assistants, It‘i»
iiiilly we were iillocnled two out,
of ii liitiil of some 350. Consider-
ing that there are only ii dozen or
so iieiidcniie buildings on this po-
dium, the division seems question
iible. ()n the biiiiiti of what priori-
ties iirc grnduiitc assistants as-
signed?

5. One of the strangest things to
come from the issues rccontiy
presented is the fact that com-
plaints miidc by students to the
ofﬁce of the Vice-President scam
to stay In that ofﬁce. The Univer-

FRIDAY, APRIL 14, 1972

 

sity ordinarily feels that the chain
of authority should be considered
in almost 'all instances. Indeed,
even in broad protest the art
students sought to reach each
level of the administration. The
question here is if student com-
plainta are to be heard in other
ofﬁces, is it not clearly the re-
sponsibility of any other office to
inform the departmental ofﬁce of
the nature or cause of such com-
plaints, and indeed who has
lodged the complaints? While stu-
dents or faculty surely have the
right to complain about many
things, we must really question
the anonymous eomplainer who,
given the protection of no identi-
fication, becomes an informer.
This is a very serious matter, and
it should be openly discussed and
a policy should be outlined to
which students and faculty can
subscribe. This might even be a
matter that should be brought
before the University Senate.

Collette Vietnam

’l‘o [he SUN YA community:

We have recently heard from Mr.
Nixon about his plan to withdraw
American troops from Vietnam.
Our newspapers point out that
these forces are only being moved
to Thailand and thus Vietnam will
still be subject to attack from the
air und sea, and the people will
continue to live in constant
danger.

Everyone knows that Vietnam is
being reduced to it wasteland, the
soil and rivers iirc being chem»
iciil|:v poisoned. it. will ttikc de-
cades for them to becoiric pro-
ductive again, if ever. The same
defoliiints which have caused the
collapse of the Vietnamese ecolo-
gy are also responsible for the
increase in birth defects.

People want to help end this
horror and would be prepared to
miikc regular donations. However,
conﬁdenCc is sometimes liicking

that every dollar collected will be

Registrar
Speeds Up

To the Editor:

After all of the years that. l
have been complaining about.
the Registrar‘s ofﬁce, including
some celebrated broadsides
years ago as an ASP columnist, i
feel that I must go out of my
way to compliment that ofﬁce
when a ﬁne job above and
beyond the call of duty has
been done.

When I did not receive a tran-
script of my grades after sum-
mer school last year, and then
again after last fall's semester, 1
made something of a complaint
to the ofﬁce.

i am happy to report that my
request has been granted, and
that since that time I have had
no trouble getting copies of my
transcript mailed to me at. my
home.

in fact, I have been receiving
these transcripts at rate ol'i
slightly more than one every
two weeks, ever since Feb. 1,
1972.

These biweekly reminders are
useful, for they contain a list of
courses I am now carrying, in
eiise I should forget. any of
them.

Further, i am kept currently
posted on the failure of the
Registrar's ofﬁce to act on the
grade change curds professors
have turned in, changing Incom-
pletes to grades. (i'm not com-
plaining; it has only been three
months.)

At it time when the adminis-
tration is desperately cutting
funds across the university, in»
cluding the amount. of ﬁnancial
aid that graduate students will
receive next year, however, I
can only wonder how many
other students ~are receiving
transcripts every two weeks
Adding up iin eight—cent
stump for each one, plus paper,
envelopes, clerical time for prc~
puriilion, printing, and mailing,
and the extra loud and time for
university postal ofﬁcials, it
seems that if mine is not an
isolated situation, quite a few
dollars are being dropped down
the drain.

i'm sure the money is not
enough to create ii few more
teaching lines, or even to foru-
iitiill equipment cutbacks. bul. i
should think the total might be
enough to ﬁnance either the
time to process the grade
change cards l have pending. or
the provision of ofﬁcial trun-
iicrlphi for thine students who
must wait. long periods while
jobs or graduutc school admis-
sions hung in the balance.

Sincerely.

Cuts Back

To the SUN YA community:

One of the most valuable yet
gronly disregarded assets this
semester to the SUNYA com-
munity is the opening of the
Day Care Center at Pierce Hull.
After much struggling, the Cen-
ter reopened us ii parent. cooper-
atch on $3.000 given it by
central Council in the form of
scholarships to students‘ child-
ren. Last month the Budget
Committee cut the budget. re-
quest for the Center to the same
amount, $3,000, but for a full
year (the previous allocation
was for one semester) with it
restriction lhlll. none of the
money be used for scholarships.
'I1ic rationale, typical of other
asiiiinc bureaucracies plaguing,
this school and our country, is
that if we spend the money on
equipment and make our Center
extremely attractive to faculty,
we can charge them high rates
and possibly give the students ii
break!

No parent is sending his child
to our center free of ﬁnancial
charge or work ruponsibility. If
this budget. in pulsed u rucom-

Day Care

mended, many parents will not
be able to return to school next
fall because they cannot 31fde
the $30—$40 ii week it will cost
them.

Our only recourse to the Bud-
get Committee's decision is to
take our case to the SUNYA
population in the form of ii
petition asking that some of
their tiix money go to the Day
Care Center in the form of
scholarships, so lhnt ﬁnancially
needy students with children
eiiii attend school.

We need those signatures by
Thursday, so give it minute of
your time and stop by at our
table in the CC lobby, or call
436-0184 for other info. We
need your help to be heard.
