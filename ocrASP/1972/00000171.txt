Lampert also points out that his
most important appointments -
appointments of people who di-
rectly affect policy - must be
approved by. Central Council. In
addition, the various committees
are appointed by cabinet mem-
bers, not Lampert, and he says
that “all the cabinet members
don't think like I do.” “The cabi-
net," he cautions. “is not. just a
group of yes men." “I have never
met, face to face, most of the
people I appoint," concludes the
SA President.

Lampert also’ commented on
charges that he has “attempted to
take over more that the executiVe
branch.” He claims that his slow-
ness to appoint Supreme Court
Justices was not an attempt on his
part to keep the court weak by
ensuring that there would be no
quorum He claims that the Court
has "no speciﬁc quorum" and the
three justices were still constitu-
tionaly able to decide cases. " l
have to admit to being slow,"
explains Lampert, “but the court
could meet with three judges." In
order to fill the missing seats,
Lampert claims that his cabinet
met for five hours screening ap-
plicants, and in early December
appointed three new members.
The court is still not up to its
constitutionally authorized size of

7 members, and over half of the

seats were vacant for an entire

semester. during which time the
court was inactive.

Finally, Lampert made remarks
about the alleged “communi-
cations gap" between his ofﬁce
and the students, asking: "How
do you effectively communicate
with 8,000 undergraduates?" As
existing methods of communi-
:ation he cites the annual report
nailed to students, and the publi-
mtion, “Bits and Pieces" which is
nailed to students in September,
ind in which all appointments to
3A offices are announced.

Lampert sees his task as one of
"upward, rather than downward
communication", meaning that it
is his job to relate student needs
and wishes to SUNYA and SUNY
Central administrators morethan-
it is to meet with students. “My
job" explains Lampert, “is to rep-
resent the students‘ interests,"
and he characterizes himself as a
“bureaucracy watcher.” As a spe-
cific example of how he has
“acted in the student interest“, he
cites several days of meeting; he
had with SUNY trustees and
Chancellor Boyer concerning the
recent tuition hike. He claims that
be, along with several other stu-
dent government leaders from
across the state, “persuaded them
to change the plan so tlial the not
taxable income waiver didn‘t end
at $8,000, but $l2,l)00."

As a filial example ofcommuni‘
cation with the students, Lamperl.
cites his "President's Report" to
Central Council. "Central Coun-
cil" he claims, "is much better
informed than ever before," as a
result of this regular report.

Middle Earth:

by Vicki Gottlich

Over on Dutch Quad, in the
director’s apartment in Ten Eyck
Hall, a dedicated group of people
work patiently and diligently to
supply this campus and the com-
munity with a Mfenul service that
meets a variety of needs. Only
two years old, Middle Earth has
gone through a variety of names,
locations, and functions to give
SUNYA one of the best referral
services in the area.

Two years ago this month, save
and people got together to form a
referral service similar to the Re-
fer Switchboard. Tliey worked
out of counseling, with Louis
Ring, who worked at Refer, run~
ning and organizing the organiza-
tion in those months before the
strike. However, John Tucker and
Louis Lieberman's offices in enun-
seling Were too small to hold such
a growing group of workers, and
Fall Semester, 1970, found Crisis
Line 5300, as it was called then,
operating in the Campus Center.
This, too, was inadequately small,
necessitating the move to Dutch
Quad. In the course of the past
year and half, they dropped the
“Line 5300" from their name,
and then changed their name com-
pletely to Middle Earth when they
expanded their services.

The original Crisis was basically
for switchboard referrals, u place

where people could talk about
their problems and come if they
had no alternatives. Middle Earth
has expanded to include couns
seling and educating the campus
and the community on relevant
topics. Middle Earth sponsored
the campus heroin seminar this
semester, and also goes out and

the repeaters, people who call on
a consistent level to deal with
their problems. The second deals
with drug information and educa-
tion, dealing with anything from
information on the effects of eer-
tnin drugs to how to handle a
person who has just taken some
drug. The third category is the
referrals, which include draft,
birth control, psychological, and
legal roferencvs. I’cer problems
conslilnte another major portion
of the calls. These are calls re-
lating to social, family, and sexual
problems. The last category con-
sists of trivia and miscellaneous
informalion, mostly concerning
information about the university.
When a call comes, the workers
have sew-ral allernatives. If they
feel incompetent to handle the
situation, they can refer the caller
to a special agency equipped to
handle the problem. But the staff
feels that it is best at talking the
problem out, the anonimity
making it easier for the caller to
talk. They offer a nonjudgemental
philosophy, giving alternatives but
never defniittI answers. Althouin
all calls are recorded, they are
done so only by the callers sex or
first mime, thus preserving the
anonymous nature of the calls.
Rut Middle Earth is more than
just a switchboard. Ongoing
training is continuous. There are
speakers and films and seminars
on the major problems, including
such topics as raising bail, suicide
prevention, the Gay Liberation
Front, and legal liabilities. These

mourns" ‘
are not open only to current
switchboard operators and new
recruits, but to the general public
as well. They are also constantly
revising their referral list to make
it up to date. This is done by
checking other referral agencies,
telephone directories, and through
personal connections. Within the
next week, Middle Earth also
plans a general reorganization to
operate more as a collective and
to get more people into the organ-
ization. They want the staff to
become better acquainted, which

would enable them to discuss
problems and share experiences.
Middle I‘lmhplays a vital role
on this campus. Yet, it is still not
without its problems. They are
funded on a yearly basis, and as
yet do not know where the
money for next year will come
from. There is also the problem of
a location for next year, though
they do have various possibilities.
The great number of volunteers
sometimes become disgruntled
and disillusioned, but on the
whole, they are working very well.

New Course
Offered

For the i972 Fall Semester, the
Department of Slavic Languages
and Literatures, in collaboration
with the Russian Student Club, is
offering a course in Russian Civili-
zation, No. 25.1, to students ofall
Departments. This course will
cover the development of Russian
Civilization from its inception to
ii)l7.

Knowledge of Russian language
is not required; the program will
be l‘I)ll(lllCI.l'iI in English. The aim
of such a comprehensive course is
to offer a broad survey of the
main fact-Ls in Russian culture, “a
development and impact. It will
endeavor In put into focus the
peculiarities inherent. to this dis
tinctive, multifaceted, sometimes
rather complex culture. It is also
hoped that through exposure to
the Russian cultural heritage and
to the different clinractt-ristcs of
its civilization, il broader under-
standing ul’ Russia lLself, and of its
242 million inhabitants, will thus
be derived. This, it is believed,

will be of substantial] benefit to
overall maturity and educational
dimension, and will stimulate bet
ter communication.

One should also keep in mind
that the scope of our own
American culture, for a substan-
tial part, is beholden to the con‘
tributions of Western European
cultural values; mainly Anglo-
Saxon and Latin. However, the
Slavic countries of Eastern Eu-
rope, mid among those, Russia,
have a great deal to offer as well.
Because of its geographic situation
and etlinical differences, Russian
civilization does present a most
valuable picture, cxpecially when
examined in terms of comparison
with the Western World.

This interdepartmental program
will benefit from the expertise of
various members of the SUNYA
faculty, who have kindly agreed
to add their contribution to this
undertaking. These participating
members are:

Professors» Robert F. Cock-
rellrMusic: Mojoinir S, Frintir
Fine Art; W.W. ilelscr'
Geography, John Nicolopoulos
History; Lois Sl()l‘.i""llt)lltll‘.ill
Science.

Furthermore, audio-visual nlll'
ti-rial will be used extensively.

The course will be given on
'l‘ucsdiiys and Thursdays, 8:45
pm. to 5:00 pm. Due to the
variance in length of the audio-
visual presentations, provision
should be made for occasional
enumc period extensions beyond
regular recess time.

Dr. Alexander I’. Obolensky,
Assistant Professor, Department
of Slavic Languages iind Litera-
ture, will conduct the program.
