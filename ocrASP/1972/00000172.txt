ing night club act which included
a segment where she accompanied
herself on piano while singing her
toe-tapping gospel-ﬂavored songs.
Soon she was in demand for night
club appearances and for TV guest
shots.

In the winter of 1966, Aretha
Franklin joined Atlantic Records.
Her first Atlantic single, “I Never
Loved A Man the Way I Love
You," was recorded in Muscle
Shoals, Alabama, under the per-
sonal supervision of Atlantic
Executive Vice President Jerry
Wexler. That record, released in
February of 1967, became an
immediate smash, selling over
1,000,000 copies and turning into
one of the biggest records of the
year, earned a certified gold
record and brought Miss Franklin

 

 

When Aretha Franklin made
her ﬁrst recording at the age of 18
she was hailed by critics as the
most exciting new blues singer to
arrive on the music scene since
Dinah Washington. Her ability to
project feeﬁng and emotion, her
purity of tone, her inspired varia-
tions and vocal gymnastics, and
her unique phrasing marked her as
a singer who would rise to the top
of the entertainment world. In a
few short years she reached a
position of such eminence that
she is now referred to simply as
Lady Soul.

Miss Franklin comes by her
musical talents naturally. She is
one of ﬁve children of the Reve-
rend C.L. Franklin of Detroit,
himself a reverend figure in the
world of gospel music. At an early
age Aretha began singing along
with her brothers and sisters in
the choir of The New Bethel
Baptist Church, her father‘s pasto—
rate in Detroit. The training she
gained in the ﬁeld of gospel music
as a youngster had a tremendous
influence on her musical style.
and the roots of gospel are still

present today in her singing.
At the age of 14, Aretha joined

her father on his evangelistic tours.

For four years she created such a
sensation as soloist with her
father’s choir in the nation's
churches that she was considered
by many to be the new queen of
gospel music.

When she turned 18 Aretha be-
gun to give serious thought to
singing blues. It was a difficult
step for her to tirl'e after her
many years of gospel singing. She
was encouraged to make the move
by Major "Mule" Holly, the has-
sist for pianist Teddy Wilson. Hol~
ly convinced her to audition for
John Hammond, Columbia Re-
cord A&R executive. Hammond
was so impressed by her singing
that he signed her immediately to
a recording contract.

Her career as a blues singer
blossomed. She started to appear
in one-night shows iind in con—
certs, and built a large and en-
thusiastic following among blues
and R&B fans. An exceptional
pianist as well as It gifted singer,
Miss Franklin developed lln excit-

the national and international
prominence that had been long
overdue.

In March 1967, Atlantic issued
her first album on the label, called
“I Never Loved A Man the Way I
Love You." Within a few months
it passed the $1,000,000 mark in
sales and earned Miss Franklin
another certiﬁed gold record.

By the summer of 1967, Aretha
Franklin had become the biggest
female star in the record world of
pop and sould music. During the
rest of the year she scored with
three more million selling singles:
"Respect," “Baby I Love You,"
and "Chain of Fools." She won
the NATRA (National Association
of Television & Radio Announ-
cers) poll as “Singer of the Year,"
and swept every trade paper poll
(Billboard, Cash Box, and Record
World) as the female singer of the
year for both single records and
albums. Her second Atlantic al-
bum “Aretha Arrives" also be-
came a best-seller.

Miss Franklin started off 1969
with her fifth million selling
single, "Since You've Been
Gone," and her ﬁfth certified gold
record for single records from the
RIAA. She became the first fe-
male singer to ever earn five certi-
ﬁed gold records. Her third Atlan-
tic album “Lady Soul" turned
into a runaway best seller, and
earned Miss Franklin still another
gold record by August, 1968. She
also won two Grammy Awards
from NARAS (National Academy

In the spring of 1968 Miss
Franklin made her first tour of
Europe, where she was greeted
with the same critical acclaim and
the same turnaway crowds that
flock to her concerts in this coun-
try. She played England, France,
Germany, Holland, and Sweden
and made many new fans and a
new album, “Aretha In Paris."

Aretha Franklin ﬁnished off
1968 with two more million sell-
ing singles, "Think" and “I Say A
Little Prayer,”and her third gold
album, “Aretha Now."

Nineteen sixty nine saw Miss
Franklin produce another mil-
lion—seller, “See Saw," bringing
her fantastic total of eight gold
singles and three gold LP‘s. She
also recorded the best-seller “Soul
’69."

So far in 1970, Aretha has
treated her fans to two more
albums: “This Girl’s In Love With
You,” and “Spirit In the Dark"
released in August, 1970.

Dr. Freddie L. Thomas of the
University of Rochester will speak
on “Historical Perspectives of the
Black Man’s Contributions to
Science and Technology." Dr.
Thomas is a Cell Biologist and is
internationally famous black-Sci-
entific historian. Many groups,
countries, governments, consult
Dr. Thomas on matters pertaining
to scientific contributions of the
non-white races.

Miss LeVem Bean is another of
the symposium speakers. She will
give some tips as to how minority
students may overcome a lot of

their difficulties in thier study of
science subjects. Miss Bean is a
black student, a senior majoring in
Physics. She hopes to start a PH.D
program next fall in BioPhysics.

THE BLOOD DRIVE

The Black Weekend Science Com-
mittee is sponsoring a campus
witle blood drive in honor of Dr.

Charles Drew. This is done mostly
as a service to the community to
emphasizo the work of Dr. Drew.
The Blood Drive starts April 14,
and runs through the PUerto-Ri-
can weekend, April 24. eeryone
is asked to donate blood in honor
of Dr. Charles Drew, who made
blood donation possible.

THE SCHOLARSHIP FUND

To establish a permanent memory
of Dr. Charles Drew, a Charles
Drew Scholarship Fund is being
organized. This fund will be used
to encourage more minority stu-
dents major in the sciences by
giving limited scholarships to
those that excel in the scienou. A
fund drive for this scholarship
starts immediately and will cont-
inue through the semester both on
campus and in the community.
All who believe, as we do, that
true social equality can come only
when all segments of society have
meaningful skills (which nteans
much more scientiﬁc and techni—
cal education for minoritim) are
urged to support this fund-raising.
