ward Air Control spotter plane,
the rice paddies and jungles below
looked diseased. The 13-52 “carpet
bombing raids" left mile after
mile of shattered jungle, smallpox-

like craters and scars in the yel-
low earth. Their paths of destruc-
tion stretched over mountain
tops, across rivers, and into valleys
like some chaotic attempt” to build
a super-highway from the air.

I first saw such raids in 1907.
Since that time the B-fzil's have
quietly continued their strikes.
But this last week they were back
in the headlines as a result of the
new Vietnamese offensive. Radio
Hanoi reported, “Another 13-52
Strategic bomber was shot down
over Ving Linh on April 2 at 3:30
PM. This was the second 8-52
shot down by liberation forces
and people in 3 days." When
asked about this report, Defense
Department spokesman Jerry
Friedheim said, "We do not eom~

Simultaneously, the US com-
mand announced it was rushing
twenty more of the huge planes
into llie Indochinese war to meet
the current Vietnamese offensive.

As US troops have been with-
drawn from active ground fight-
ing, the US war has become al-
most exclusively an air war, and
the most important weapon in the
Wllr is the 8-52.

The Boeing company built some
7114 of these giant Stratofortresses
at their Wichita, Kansas, and
Seattle, Washington, plants be»
tween 1952 and 1966, when the
last one was delivered to the Air
Force. These Leviathnns of the air
measure 156 feet long, stand
40'8" high, and have a wing span
of 185 feet.

Weighing almost 250 tons each,
they cost $8 million apiece to

added. They were designed and

Bomb Tonnage Can’t

Dear friends,

The Viet Nam war that President Nixon wants to lililh’t'
disappear from the news topics in the United States and
from the conscience of the American people, has probably
made great headlines on the newspapers you are reading .iiid

escape the attention of all those who are interested in
following the developments over there, especially when thi-
Nixon Administration is massively sending aircraft and
warships to our country for intensified bombardiaciits and
when “the possible Lise of U.S. ground forces is not rah-d

and Steve Colin

Over four million Indochinese
civilians who were alive and well
when Richard Nixon took office
are now dead, wounded, or refu-
geed (source: Senate Subcommit-
tee on Refugees). Another
360,000 Asian and American sol-
diers have been killed and
500,000 more wounded under Mr.
Nixon (source: Pentagon Office of
Information).

Once-peaceful Cambodia has
suffered widespread devastation,
the bombing of Laos has been
doubled with catastrophic results,
10,000 new Thai soldiers have
been introduced into Laos, the
A.R.V.N. has attacked the Ho Chi
Minh Trr..l from the air and on the
ground, and the bombing of
North 'liet Nam has been resumed
«twice a week since the first of
this year.

All of this is to say that there is
a substantial difference between a
Richard Nixon who seriously int-
ends to end the war, and .1
Richard Nixon who is waging a
war from the air even as he
removes his foot-soldiers.

 

Siang Boua Pha’s mother

My son, Siarig Boua Pha, was very ill
from sickness in his lungs in May,

1968.

He was in the big hospital at Moung

Kham, which was in a cave.

While he was there, planes bombed it

and he was killed.

More than 700 other people were bur-
ied alive in the cave at the same time,

 

In a word, the President‘s desire
to maintain a hold on Indochina
leaves him nothing to negotiate
about.

His latest troop withdrawal an-
nouncement is the clearest indica-
tion yet that he has no intention
whatsoever of ending the air war.
For in this statement he went out
of his way to stress his reliance on
the air war. With it, he served
formal notice that Nixon's air war
has replaced Johnson‘s ground
war.

The President's Nov. 13 state-
ment on the war was preceded by
the publication of a study of the
air war by a group of Cornell
University professors. Widespread
publicity was given to the fact
that while withdrawing ground
troops Mr. Nixon had dropped
nearly three million tons of
bombs in his first three years in
office, as much bombing as occur-
red duriag Mr. Johnson's last
three years.

The thorough, care fully worded,
and well-documented Cornell stu-
dy also revealed the widespread
devastation (‘nused by this bomb-
ing raised serious doubts about its
effectiveness, pointed out that it

will cost at least $3 billion this
year, and that the 50,000 tons
still being dropped monthly car-
ries the "potentiality and proba-
bility of severe civilian casualties."
To the best of our knowledge, no
one has yet challenged its ﬁnd-
ings.

Until now, the President has
successfully blurred this distinc-
tion by bringing American boys
home, keeping his air war secret,
and -- like his predecessor-- never
losing an opportunity to speak on
his search for a negotiated settle-
meat.

As the more than 500,000 corp-
ses produced under Mr. Nixon
suggest, however, this talk of ne-
gotiations is a brutal sham. It may
be true, as many Americans be-
lieve, that Mr. Nixon would ideal-
ly like to be rid of the Indochina
mess. But it is also true, in his
own words, that he intends to
keep fighting to “leave South Viet
Nam in a position where it will be
able to defend itself from a com-
munist takeover."

Given this national attention on
the air war, and the statement by
Republican minority leader Hugh
Scott that the President would

Nixon’s Ongoing Air War ‘

“surprise everyone" by dramatic
peace initiatives, it was widely
expected that Mr. Nixon would
attempt to minimize_ the bombing
iuue.

Instead he played it up.

When asked about air power at
his surprise pres conference, he
responded: “Well, air power, of
course...will continue to be used
longer than our ground forces..-
.and we will continue to use it in
support of the South Vietnamese
until there is a negotiated settle-
ment, or, looking further down
the road, until the South Vietna—
mese have developed the capabil-
ity to handle the situation them-
selves..."

"...Lct me also say this: as we
reduce the number of our forces,
it is particularly important for us
to continue our air strikes on the
inﬁltration routes. If we see any
substantial step-up in inﬁltration
in the passes, for example...we
will have to step them up.

To those unfamiliar with the
"newspeak" pf Nixon's air war,
let us interpret:

Ofﬁcially, our officials only ad-
mit two uses of air power: “tacti-
cal air support" to Asian troops in

combat, and "interdiction" on en-
emy supply lines to prevent infil-
tration.

As the Cornell air war study
documents, for example, 10 per
cent of our strikes in South Viet
Nam are considered tactical air.
and the other 90 percent are listed
as interdiction.

When Mr. Nixon speaks of con-
tinued bombing to prevent “infil-
tration,” therefore, he is talking
about the kind of blanket bomb-
ing of civilian targets that has
already left most of Indochina in
ruins; and he may even be threat-
ening resumption of the bombing
of North Viet Nam.

The President stated on Nov. 13
that “every promise that I have
made I have kept to this date and
that usually is a pretty good ex-
ample of what you might do with
regard to future promises."

Richard Nixon is indeed keeping
his promise to end American
ground fighting in Viet Nam, how-
ever gradually.

The only problem for those of
us who would like to see him halt
his mass murder in Indochina is
that he’s never promised to end
the war.

The Survivors...

Death comes in many forms to the villagers of

Laos.

During the last seven years American planes have
dropped well over a million tons of antipersonnel

bombs, napalm.

fragmentation

bombs, and

500-pound bombs on Laos. Much has fallen on
undefended villages, and most casualties have been

civilians.

Unlike Vietnam, two-thirds of Laotian territory
has been off-limits to pro-American ground forces.
This area in controlled by the insurgent Pathet Lao.
The American Embassy estimates that it is inhabited

by over one million people.

The American response has been to bomb the
villages, in an attempt. to destroy the economic and
social infrastructure from the air. For most of
these seven years the outside world has been

unaware of the bombing.

American officials deny that the U.S. is bombing

villages. Unlike Vietnam,

they do not permit

newsmen to go out on bombing raids in Laos. Few
outsiders have visited Pathet Lao zones.

In the fall of 1969, however, some 30,000 people
were taken out of heavily bombed areas in northern
and southern Laos by CIA-led mercenaries. The
refugees were put in camps in American-controlled

areas in the Mekong valley.

For the ﬁrst time outsiders were told of life
under the bombs, They listened in disbelief as
refugees described how they hid in holes, tunnels,
and trenches for years on end, how they feared to
light fires or farm their fields, how they saw loved
ones killed while running or crawling for trenches,

or while shielding a baby.

Well over one thousand refugees have been inter-
viewed by now. Several hundred case histories have
been recorded on film and tape.

We publish here but a few examples.

For all they have been through, these people are

relatively fortunate.
They survived.
