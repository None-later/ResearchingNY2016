On Friday. March 24th the ASP
published the first in a scrim of
human interest stories about stu-
dents on our campus and what
they are doing to make SUNYA a
better and more desirable place.

This week the ASP spoke with
Eric does, a Central Council Rep-
resentative from Colonial Quad,
Chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee and member of Sigma Tau
Beta Fraternity. In the past Joss
has also been Chairman of the
Undergraduate Political Science
Association and has served on the
Search Committee to ﬁnd a new
chaimran for the Political Science
Department.

As a Political Science major Joss
takes a very active interest in our
student govemment. He talked at
length about his work for the

Finance Committee and explained
what its responsibilities involve.
The Committee examines all re
quests for appropriations sub-
mitted by var-iot- student organi-
sations and reviews each group’s
budget, item by item. “We try to
facilitate the" work of Council so
that they don’t wute alot of time
mking small question about a
budget. We take alot more timeto‘
look at each line in the budget".
said Jose. “Once we make the

necessary cuts or recommenda-

tions I write up a bill and submit

it to countil at their next meeting.

I introduce the Bill and Council
acts on it." If a group requests a
very small sum of money to pay
for a ﬁlm or speaker, it is possible
for the Finance Committee to
approve that request by a major-
ity vote of the Committee mem-
ber without going to Central
Council for ﬁnal approval. “I
think most people would agree
that Finance is the most impor-
tant standing committee in Coun-
cil," said Joss.

 
 
  
 

 

Too Many Groups
One of Jo.” major grips ‘u that

there are so my different organ- 1
iaations on campus that it is im-
po-ible to keep up with all the

activities sponsored by them.
“I‘ve gotten in touch with jlﬂt
about every sinye group on cam-
pm", says Joss, “became every
group needs some kind of finan-
cing. [in allocating funds you have
to ask them: What's your
function? What are you doing?"
Owing to his 'pmitionu chairman,
Jess has probably been able to
acquire a more thorough know-
ledge of mmpus organizations
than any other student at
SUNYA.

Joss is also an appointed mem-
ber of the Executive Budget Com-
mittee and the Central Council
Budget Committee which has en-
abled him to view all ﬁnancial
aspects of student government.
“People wonder where the money

collected from student tax gas," A  Couldn't-l Eric J“ ll M W in Student
Joan said. "and that's probably the Amer-tion! hudllﬂl'y functions. Joss foals um Fin-Ice Committee

by Vicki Zeldin
Capitol Correspondent

A bill that would put an end to
mandatory activities fees at SUNY
campuses is currently awaiting ac-
tion by the State Senate.

The measure, sponsored by Hud-
son Republican Senator Schermer-
horn, is expected to pass the
Senate with little opponition, and
according to its sponsor, pass the
Assembly as well. Schermerhorn
also stated that he was “conﬁ-
dent" that the Governor would
sign his measure.

To support his case, the Senator
bronght to the chamber a folder
full of examples of what he
termed “degrading” and “distaste-
ful” literature. Most numerous
among the examples of news-
papers that he displayed was Al-
bany's Sweet Fire although the
Senator stated that he had seen
other campus papers that he also
disagreed with.

Schermerhorn stated that he

Kill Mandatory Tux

didn't "...agree with the type of
material..." used in Sweet Fire
and several other publications. He
claimed that he had received
"...letters from veterans saying
that it's not fair to have to pay a
fee to support an anti-American
newspaper...” The Senator con—
tinued, “...print all you want but
don’t force people to pay...it‘s
demeaning to people to support
something they don’t agree
with..." He stated that the fee
should be paid voluntarily.

Aside from what he termed
“anti - American" publications,
the Senator also objected to the
use of profanity that he found in
many papers. In his folder, the
Senator also displayed copies of
budgets of a variety of organiza-
tions funded by Student Tax. He
proferred a copy of WSUA's bud-
get and stated that the station had
claimed to be a leftist news media.
This evidentally stemmed from an
ad from the station that was run
in Sweet Fire stating, “WSUA-On
The Left Side of Your Dial."

A similar measure aimed at end-
ing the mandatory fee had been

introduced in the Assembly by
Staten Island Republican-
Conservative Lucio Russo. He too
cited obscene and politically ori-
ented publications in his explana-
Lron of the bill. This measure hm
failed to reach the Assembly floor
because of reportedly strong op-
position from some members of
the Assembly Education Commit-
tee. In fact, when questioned Int
week as to the status of his bill,
Russo stated, “I told Connie
(Constance Cook is the head of
the Assembly Education Commit-
tee) to forget it...”

Currently, all SUNY campuses
levy a mandatory student activi-
ties fee. Over $5 million is genera-
ted by the fee, which according to
the cancellor’s guidelines can be
no higher than $70 a year. Albany
State's fee currently stands at $60
a year, and both Swleel Fire and
WSUA are funded to some degree
by the fee.

In summing up his arguments in
defense of his bill, Schermerhorn
stated, “I wouldn't let my kids go
to a school that publishes papers
like these..."

   
     
   
   
     
   
     
   
   
   
     
   
     
   
     
     
     
    

A gathering of angy students confronted ROTC recruiter at the
Administration Building early Friday morning. The students, carrying
Vietcong flags, were demanding that ROTC stay off the SUNYA

campus.

Later in the day a larger gathering of students staged a rally in front
of the Campus Center fountain. The recent actions were pro prod by
the escalated bombing of North Vietnam ordered by the Nixon

administration.

Council Debates Schedule, Spring Elections

by Kim Steven Juhsse

The Central Council on Thurs-
day took positions on two contro-
versial issues facing SUNYA - the
197 3-74 school caldendar and the
Student Association election
schedule.

The school calendar issue was
brought up by Bob Gibson, chair-
man of the Ad Hoc Committee on
the Calendar, who asked for “in-
put" from the Council members.
Gibson laid out the ground rules
for the debate by outlining certain
mandatory State regulations, i.e.,
school cannot open later than
September 15 or have classes end
before May 15, and there must be
at least 30 full weeks of instruc-
tion. Two basic types of sched-
ules, the traditional and the early,
were considered. Under the tradi-
tional format, school would open
on September 15 with students

returning in January for final
exams and getting out in mid
June. The early plan is what is
currently in effect at SUNYAThe
major argument against the early
plan was that it hurt students who
work at camps or resorts which
may require them to stay until
Labor Day. The early plan suppor-
ters answered by saying that get-
ting out early gave SUNYA stu-
dents a jump in the student job
market. In a straw poll, which has
no legal standing, the Council
voted 18 in favor of the early plan
and 2 in favor of the traditional.

The second matter to come up
for discussion was the election
schedule. Mike Lampert, President
of the Student Association, asked
the Council for their position on
the issue so he could give a recom-
mendation to the Election Com-
missioner who has final say

in the scheduling. Three models
were discussed. Model 1 would
hold all elections, except Central
Council, on April 26, 27, 28, with
Central Council elections and run-
offs from the April elections on
May 3, 4, 5. Model 2 would have
all general elections on May 3, 4,
5, with runoffs on May 8, 9.
Finally, Model 3 would hold elec-
tions sometime in the fall.

Patrick Curran, the only fresh-
man member of Council, argued
that spring elections disenfran-
chise freshmen even though they
pay student tax. He sarcastically
asked Council members how often
they actually consulted their con-
stituents and concluded that stu-
dent elections were the only way
for students to voice their opinion
on student affairs. Councilman
Ken Stokem said that, with elec-
tions in the spring, people would

be too busy ﬁnishing papers and
studying for exams to vote.

In opposition, it was brought up
that since the terms of ofﬁce for
S.A. representatives expire in the
spring, the University would have
no student government for four
months with elections in the fall.
in two straw polls the Council
voted in favor of Model 2.

In another action, the Council
voted in favor of designating the
SUNYA Gay Alliance as a cultural
group for ﬁscal purposes. A
spokeswoman for the group stated
that the reason this had to be
done was that the S.A. wouldn’t
give them any money because
they thought they too political.
Jack Schwartz then made a
motion to designate the Albany
Coalition for Peace and Justice as
a cultural group for fiscal pur-
poses. The motion was defeated.

 

 

   

Peace People
Stage Protest

Albany peace workers demon
strated outside the Interna;
Revenue Service office at noon
yesterday, in their third succes
sive Tax Day protest against
military spending.

The demonstration. arrangeti
by Albany SANE (Citizens Or-
ganization for a Sane World
and the Capital Area War Tax
Resistance Center, took place
on the sidewalk outside the IRS
building at 161 Washington
Ave., Albany, from 11:30 am to
1:30 pm.

The demonstrators offered
passersby slices of apple pie of a
size to suggest how little is left
over for "human resources" af-
ter the military takes its 61 per
cent of the national budget.

They also distributed leaﬂets
with a pie-shaped diagram of
the national budget, illustrating.
that 61 per cent of tax incomesi
goes to pay for past and present
wars. The leaﬂet explained how
the big military expenditure ag-
gravates inflation.

An “Uncle Sam" ﬁgure with
sandwich-board sign explained
to taxpayers meeting the dead-
line for ﬁling income tax re-
turns where their money is
going.
