BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP)—Bernadette
Devlin, and another Irish member of the British
Parliament were sentenced in absentia today to six
months in jail for taking part in an illegal parade.

Nothem Ireland’s young Roman Catholic ﬁre-
brand and the other lawmaker, Frank McManus,
refused to appear in court in Ennlskillen and were
not represented by lawyers. But she said earlier she
would go to jail if convicted.

They were convicted of defying the ban on
parades by joining a march in Enniskillen in
February to protest the killing by British para-
troopers of 13 civilians on Londonderry's Bloody
Sunday.

Meanwhile, British troops battled vengeance
snipers in the streets of Belfast and Londonderry
Sunday night as guerilla gunmen retaliated for the
slaying of IRA chieftain Joseph McCann.

Assembly
Pushes
Constituency
Around

To the Editor:

After reading the centerfold in
Friday‘s ASP I am really pissed
off. I can’t see where students on
this campus can afford to not get
their backs up about the tuition
increase. The increase in tuition
reﬂects two things: 1) New York
State believm - and obviously
with just cause — that it can
decide how to spend tax dollars
and push its constituency around
and 2) State Universities, by
charging $650 tuition for frmh-
men and sophomores and $800
for juniors and seniors, are be-
coming as elite as private universi~
tics. if this increase goes through,
how much higher will tuition go?

In order for many of us to get
jobs we want that also satisfy the
demiinds of this society's tech-
nology’ a high school diploma is
no longer sufﬁcient. Just as the
state would never think of charg-
ing tuition to public highschool, it
is now, more than ever, the state's
responsibility to provide ii college
cducution for those that want it.
SUNY had no tuition until 1963;
CUNY, until now, has never had
tuition.

It is time we raise our voices and
make a stink. it’s time we tell our
rcprcscntutivcs in Congress where
we want our money to go. Forget
highways and state offices. Slop
screwing those people who have
liccn donc-in for so long already.
thn the stiitc wants to ﬁnd
money for somcthing, they find
it. it‘s time for lhcm to ﬁnd some
for education now.

To hear studcnls gch in to
ridiculous pushing around is (lis-
gusting. Excuses like apathy,

tion are sickening. Those students
looking for more extensive sum-
mer jobs, who are “facing facts”
are allowing themselves to be
manipulated for someone else's
beneﬁt. If people would only real-
ize their own power, they‘d sit
around a lot less.

There is an “mm timoncam-
pus associated with a statewide
coalition of city and State Univer-
sities that is only as strong as its
members. Students and campus
groups are welcomed and URGED
to join us in the ﬁght against
tuition.

Electoral Reform Overdue

N'G‘FQES Editorial:

Central Council grappled with a very major issue last
Thursday night: thar to do abOut Student Association
elections. Since eligibility to run and eligibility to vote are
both based on dormitory and off-campus residence,

elections have had to be delayed.

Budget Committee Cuts
Jewish Coalition to $0

To the Editor:

Just before spring recess, Budget Committee cut the Jewish Students
Coalition proposed budget for 1972-73 down to $0 (zero dollars). The
stated reason for such action was that our activities were “of religious
nature, or else can be fulﬁlled by Hebrew Club.” Such an assumption
is a sizeable error on their part. ,

The activities and programming of the JSC encompass a broad range
of Jewish interests. We are requesting funding only for those events
we label as being pertinent to Jewish culture. Hebrew Club functions
as does any other language club: its functions should be directly
related to the Hebrew language and Israeli culture, which they are.

Our objects is this—how can SA outrightly deny that Jewish culture
exists apart from Jewish religion? How can they deny that there is a
need for speakers of Jewish interest on this campus? How many Jews
on this campus are not devoutly religious and yet would pack a
ballroom to hear a dynamic speaker like Meir Kahane? How many
would even show up at a Soviet Jewry rally? PLENTY! Clearly a
campus with a Jewish population the size of ours cannot be satisfied
with only one or two speakers during the course of the academic year,
paid for by the political speakers' group, should money be available.
The need is great, and the time is now!

Jews of SUNYA! Don't be stopped on again while other groups get
funded. Urge your Central Council members to override Budget
Committee's recommendation, or Jewish need will go unnoticed
again. For more information, call me at 457-5227, or Giiil Smiley at
457-5189.

Tell Lampcrt and Central Council we're not through yet!

Sincerely,
Bob Kattan
Treasurer, Jewish Students Coalition

The newly instituted hous-
ing packet turn-in procedure
will leave most: students un-
certain about where they will
live next year until early

May.
But there is another ques-
tion concerning elections

that Council seemed to gloss
over Thursday: Should in-
coming freshmcn be allowed
to vote? The current system
seems unfair and capricious;
it denies freshmen voting
power - even though they
pay the mandatory tax. It is
also wasteful; since most
undergraduate students living
in Alumni Quad are fresh-
men, it is the small minority
of rcrurnccs who clect Coun—
cil mcmbcrs czicli spring.

Tlic timc sccms long over—
due for electoral rcform. We
hope Council takes a long,
hard look zit the issue at this
