ASP Queues

Kim Juhese

Reps Don't Talk

Economics major. Kim S. Juhase
complained about student repre-
scntation. "Reps don’t consult
constituents on matters." he said.
“The majority of the students
don't know their representatives."
Kim suggested greater publicity of
representative's activities and
office hours when the students
could speak to them. Kim would
like the Student Association to be
able to control parking.

SA 'l'oo Organized

"Not very much on mine." re-
plied sophomore Barry Gershon.
“but that's mostly because i never
got inVOIVed in it. but i do partici-
pate as a spectator." Barry had
some comments on the structure
of the association. “it's too or-
ganized." he said. “like a govern-
ment or a business." He called the
Michael Lampert exclusive inter-
view in the ASP “garbage. too
pretentious." He sees the Student
Association as "a service. much
like administrative services.” He
believes SA should be more in-
formal.

When asked the topic question.
freshman 'I‘om Capuano coun-
tered. “That's the association that
throws out the money, right?" He
continued. "it has a lot of rele-
vance because a lot of the groupe
that l'm in get money from it." ‘
Tom is a member of the Peace
Project and the “alien-American
Student Alliance. "l've always
thought of it as something way in
the dletance,‘I he added.

it's nec

Gladys Wells is a commuting
graduate student with two part-
time jobs. so she doesn’t have
time to spend on-campus. She
does attend some activities. “The
Davr- Brubeck concert was excel-
lent." she said. She also attends
some of the theatrical pro-
ductions. "Especially for sormone
living on campus they do a lot."
she said. She explained that the
SA. counts more for ()ll-Cilmplls
students because they are more

“None whatsoever." asserted
senior Leon Bruno. "i don’t to-
volve myself. l’m sure they have

some kind of effect on me."
Students Unaware

Steve Meyer. a physics major
had been at a Central Council
meeting the night before. lie de-
scribed the allocation powers of
the S.A. According to Steve.
“SA. could be more relevant in
informing the students just what
their opportunities are and taking
advantage of their tax money. A
large majority of the students are
not aware of many facets of the
8.A...." Stove believes freshmen

 

 

they know as much about the
organization as most upper-
cine-men.

 

  

SA Responsive

“Well, they sponsor a lot of the
activities, don’t they?" said fresh-
man Jeff Pliskin. Jeff said he
benefits from the activities. and
that anything concerning its rules
and policies would affect him.
"It's fairly responsive to the needs
of the students," he added. He
cited concerts, in "great. selection
of films". and the special week-
ends it sponsors. '

Leon. however. doesn‘t know
what these effects are. “i think
the less the better." he declared.
He believes the administration
should handle the situation. “Stu-
dents should have only opinions.
not power.” Pointing to the anti-
War slogans that were written on
the campus he said. "l'm ag

“It keeps people from having

said sophomore Susan Towson.
Specifically she was referring to
the Black students. The Student
Association is helping to fund
Black Weekend by subsidizing the

“It can’t do anything positive.

Senior Claire Russell complained
about the Student 'l‘ax card. As a
married strident she would like to
bring her husband when she at-

tain only one ticket on her tux

Not Too Relevant

“Not too much." said junior
Howard Hoffer. "[don’t try to
reach them. and they obviously
haven't reached me too much.
Howard called himself a “token
member" of the. riding. business
and outing clubs. lll' complained
of the one~year waiting list for the
riding club. and their required
meetings. This caused him to get
disenchanted. He spoke of the
appropriation for the business
club. which he thinks is too large
for a club of about ten members.
lie thinks the organization could
be run better. and that the movies
are overvpriced. Howard believes
that he tried to get involved. but
he was discouraged by the indivi-
dual clube. "i see myself as an
example." he said.

What Do They Do?

Art major Susan Vossler said
"That's. like asking ‘Why do you
like sunshine?‘ It's vague." She
continued. “What do they do. and
then I'll tell you." We discussed
some of the functions of the S.A.
Susan then said that she reads the
newspaper, listens to the radio.
and goes to the movies. She be-
lieves the communications are
important. Susan would like to
know which students get paid for
what positions. but does not ob-
ject to paying students for such
services. She didn't like the Dela-
ney and Bonnie concert. and

would rather see the money go
to more popular entertainers, like
Tull.

little Relevance

“Well. i work for it." said Tom
Clingan. S.A. media coordinator.
He sees the S./\. as an adminis-
trative office. a law-making body
and concerned mainly with bud-
gets. He said it offers many "hid-
den" things, such as the Xerox
service. and the SA lawyer. He
sees no reason to publicize the
activities of the S.A. itselfjust the
results. and the clubs operating
under it. He believes that the
“relevance” of the S.A. is unim-
portant. and the space for this
article should be given to promote
S.A. activites. rather than the S.A.
Personally. Tom. who is not paid.
gets “a lot. ol’ joy out of being able
to work with the media groups."
