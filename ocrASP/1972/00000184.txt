It seems spring has come to
Albany at last. This Saturday,
April 22, the Special Events Board

~ is sponsoring the State Fair, giving
us all a day to enjoy the spring
weather.

The annual State Fair, which is
held on the grounds behind the
Campus Center, does more than
offer a leisurely day in the sun for
students, visiting parents, and fa-
culty members. Proceeds from the
State Fair go toward the Student
Ambassador Program The money
provides scholarship aid for one or
more foreign students who have
all the qualifications for succeed-
ing in college except for necessary
funds.

State Fair brings on campus
organizations, the faculty, and the
entire student body closer to-
gether for a day of recreation. The
profits from such a day attempt
to bring closer world communica-

interaction of foreign students
from many nations—on our cam-
pus.

Co-chairmen Bob Kanarek and
Jackie Impero have been working
to get State Fair Activities rolling.
From 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM on

nity to have your fortune told. Psi

Last year about $1,400 was
raised at State Fair. Susan Pallas,
publicity chairman for State Fair,
hopes the event will raise more
this year because tuition is going
up. This year she has invited
elementary school children to
come, through letters to their
schools. State Fair is ready to
welcome all on Saturday for a day
of joviality and fun.

 

SUNY Vying for $8 Million from
Rocky’s Supplemental Budget

by Vicki Zeldin
Capital Correspondent

The SUNY system is hoping to
receive more than $8 million from
Governor Rockefeller’si supple-
mental budget which will go be-
fore lawmakers before the end of
the 1972 legislative session.

SUNY, like most other state
agencies and programs, will be
vieing for every additional mone-
tary morsel that they can acquire
from the limited amount of funds
in the supplemental budget rec‘
ommendation.

The university's original $407
million budget recommendation
passed the legislature virtually un-
scathed shortly before the sus-
sion’s Easter-Passover recess. At
that time, the lawmakers passed
the Governor‘s close to $8 billion
hold-the-linc state budget, cutting
only some $30 million.

If the $8 million request is
aPl’rﬂved, the university would
allocate $900,000 of it to allow
for 1000 additional freshman stu-
dents next year. SUNY would also
add close to $2 million to campus
and community college EOP and
SEEK aid. Another $976,000
would go to bolster the system's
scholarship program. Over $2 mil-

lion of the supplemental appropri-
ation would be channeled to the
university’s hospital operations at
its medical centers. Additional
monies for research at several of
the state's campuses would also
come from the hoped for $8
million appropoiation.

Tuition Revenue Allocations

As a result of the SUNY Trus-
tee's decision to hike tuition rates,
the university system expects to
generate some $20 million in re-
venue. The hike, which raised the
present charge of $550 by $100
for freshmen and sophomores and
$250 for juniors and seniors, was
announced in February and its is
effective this summer. Of this
revenue, over $3 million will go
toward covering negotiated salary
increases. The largest single chunk
of the tuition money - over $3
million - will go for maintenance
of new facilities and increased
utility costs.

More than $1 million will be
allocated to summer session pro-
grams which were hit quite hard
by this year's belt tightening.
Campus libraries will receive some
$2.35 million for acquitislons -
which were threatened to be cut
in half - because of scanty funds -
and staff. An additional $850,000
will be channeled to support in-
struction and departmental re-
search. Under the heading of stu-
dent services, which includes ad-
ministration nnd general services,
$2.15 million has been allocated.

An additional $300,000 will go to
aid the system’s urban Centers

Emerging campuses will also be
aided by the income from the
tuition hike. The health sciences
center at Stony Brook is slated to
receive $900,000. The new SHNY
college at Purchase can ex pool to
receive $223,000, and the upper.
division Rome-Utica unit can ex-
pect an additional $400,000

Programs emenating from SUNY
Central Administration will be
bolstered by some $560,000. liv-
gionalism programs and faculty
research grants will claim the ma-
jority of these funds with each
receiving $200,000.

Over $500,000 of the $20 nlll'
lion from the increased tuitiun
remains unallocated. Commume
Colleges are slated to rr-cmvv
$10.8 million in local assistance
aid to help them cope with in-
creased enrollment demands.

The Outlook

Whether SUNY will rocuivo all
of the more than $8 million that
it is requesting is uncertain What
is certain is that the university ran
8Xpecl. to face stiff competition
from many state llgum'll'ﬁ lluil
have won the public's sympathy
and support this year, Dollar and
vote conscious legislators will he
eyeing all supplemental hudng
requests with barely dulled hudgi-l
axes.

 Stone Talks About Albany State 

by John Falrhall

“I have agreat fondness for for-
mal building in a rural or park-
like setting." So said Edward
Durell Stone, Albany State's
famed architect, in a 30-minute
telephone interview. Speaking
slowly yet clearly in a voice that
faintly recalled his southern birth,
Stone tried to explain some of the
reasoning behind Albany State's
design. In a friendly tone, like a
grandfather to his young descen-
dent, the architect talked, obvi-
ously pleased (“flattered,” he
said) that students were interested
in him.

A "great honor"

Stone did not try to disguise his
satisfaction with the campus. He
is proud of it and believes that
others, the governor and students,
too, share his feeling. Perhaps it is
reading between the lines, but
E.D. Stone had an ideal in mind
when he designed the school. The
ideal was education; it occupies a
high pedestal in Stone’s mind. It
was a “great honor," he said.

Albany State, being Stone's

baby to such a large extent, must
reflect many of the architect’s
ideas concerning the ideal college
enviornment. He mentioned the
need to “maintain the quiet, rest-
ful quality of the college cam-
pus," and as part of this efforts
.toward this end, he isolated the
automobile from the heart of the
campus.

Indeed, Stone said the auto was
a “fundamental consideration" in
Albany State's design. The "time
honored tradition of dispersed
buildings" would haVe meant
more roadways. And as he put it,
“Nothing is more fatal to architec-
ture than to have buildings located
in a parking lot." Stone even
asked about the enduring battle to
keep autos confined to the par-
king lots.

No autos in Albany State

Autos do not fit into the formal
architecture and parklike setting
that Stone admires. His architec-
tural attitudes reflect a strong
belief in the beauty of the past.
Stone said he likes the “chateaus
in France...Versailles." As one
writer phrased it, “His work is

marked by a dignity and purity
reminiscent of classical forms..."
Albany State certainly is an out-
growth of this belief, the same
belief that inspired Stone’s
accomplishment in Washington,
the new Kennedy Center.

Climate, of course, effected
Albany State's structure. “it is
advantageous to have all the bull-
dings connected by covered
walls." As to other campus fea-
tures, Stone said that the colon-
nades which dominate the campus
are "quite handsome." The qua-
drangles have a “unifying” design;
Stone likes the way the dorms
“connect to the dining halls and
small sunken gardens."

Architect Stone pointed out
that Albany State is somewhat
unique in that it came out as
planned—no major plan changes
or obstacles emerged during con-
struction. “This is exactly as we
designed it years ago." He takes
pride in the “fact that these buil-
dings were built within the
budget and standards given us by
the State of New York...“ is an
extremely economical group of
buildings."

were mainly the ideal of the
school's former president, Dr.
Collins. You can call it“Collins
memorial tower," Stone sugges-
ted. As for the water planted in
the podium: "We turned this
necessity into what I consider a
blessing.”

Stone also shed some light on
Rockefellcr‘s interest in Albany
State. “He takes great personal
interest and pride...His architec-
tural taste is a very cultivated
onc...He's assured me...that it is a
job well done." Stone mentioned,
with some pleasure, that Rocke-
feller flies friends and visitors over
the campus.

Thanks to Elwin Stevens

Many other individuals played
an important role in SUNYA‘s
development. Stone insisted that
credit be given to Elwin Stevens,
Clifton Flather of the Dormitory
Authority, the governor, Dr. Col-
lins, and the Construction Fund.
He said he enjoyed “excellent
relations with state and university
officials...all of them enthusiastic
and helpful."

As for students, where do they
ﬁt into the formal structure of
Albany State? The clock ran out
and the question was never di-
rectly raisc.'. but Stone did ex-
press his jaw, the "fabulous"
feeling when ht Sow kids splashing
in the pool encircling the water
tower. in a parting comment, in a
tone that could only be called
sincere, Edward Durell Stone ex-
pressed his hope that Albany
