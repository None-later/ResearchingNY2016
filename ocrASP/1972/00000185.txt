Astronauts John W. Young and Charles M. Duke
Jr. thus achieved man's ﬁfth landing on the moon
and began a three-day scientiﬁc exploration on a
plateau high in the lunar mountains.

After a delay of almost six hours, Young and
Duke guided their lunar lender in a long curving
descent from orbit and brought it to rest among the
Descartes Mountains.

They were the 9th and 10th Americans to make a
lunar landing but the first to do so in a mountain
region.

'The third Apollo 18 astronaut, Thomas 
Mattineg 11, remained in lunar orbit aboard the
command ship.

The main rocket engine problem in his ship had
been isolated in a back-up steering motor. and
Mission Control ordered the moon landing delayed
while the problem could be studied. A go-aheud for
the landing came shortly before 9:00 PM, EST, and
Young and Duke hogan thciispowercd descent to
the moon's surface during their 16th lunar orbit.

The astronauts‘ planned first moon excursion was
delayed until 11:30AM, EST, Friday. It was not
immediately decided by Mission Control what other
effect the late landing would have on the second
and third surfucc excursions.

Young and Duke are scheduled to deploy an
atomic science station near the landing site. They
will also use an electric car to roam the surface in
scorch of evidence of volcanoes thought to have
convulscd the moon billions of years ago to form
the bright. rugged mountains which cover most of
the lunar surface.
