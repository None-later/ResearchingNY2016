Tonietncrms 0 Myth

Analysis
by Paul Smith

in support of the most recent

escalation of the air war, Melvin

Laird, Secretary of Defense rind

Admiral Thomas Moorcr, Chair—

man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
attempted both to evaluate the

tactics of Hanoi rind llll‘ N.F.L.
and to justify American reaction
in the light of the Geneva Accord
of 1951. These official spokesmen
characterized the latest develop-
ments as "an invasion of the
South by the North, ii flagrant
disregard for the demilitarized
zone, a disregard both for the
territorial integrity of the South
and the legitimate desires of the
South Vietnamese people". in
short, their claim was that
everything would be ﬁne if the
North would simply leave the
South alone.

Since these people wish to root
their righteousness in the Geneva
Accord, let us re-exainine its
terms. The Conference convened
in the Spring of 1954, just a few
weeks after France‘s crushing de~
feat at Dien Bien Phii on May 7,
after which the Vietnamese were
in an excellent position to bargain
for maximum benefits. instead,
on June 8, they offered to agree
oto the temporary separation of
the Northern and Southern zones
of Vietnam although they were
exercising control over three-
quarters of the country. This con-
cession was made on very closely
defined conditions.

One that the administrative
separation of the North and South
at the 17th parallel was pro-
visional and in no way to be
construed as a permanent divi-
sion—Final Declaration, Paragraph
6. Two, that elections would be
held within two years to assure

_the uniﬁcation of the country-

PAGE 8

Chapter 2, Article 14 and Final
Declaration Paragraph 7.

The 6th Paragraph of the Final
Declaration states in black and
white that the purposc of the
1954 Agreement is to “settle mili-
tiiry questions with a view to
ending hostilities, and that the
Military Dcmarkution Line is pro-
visional and should not in any
way be interpreted as constituting
a political or territorial boun-
dary." These points were accepted
by all members of the Conference
with the exception of the United
States and the Brio Dai Regime
(the former puppet emperor irri-
der the Japanese, later installed by
the French in lilin as their figure-
head).

Although not accepting the
agreements, the United States
gave a solemn undertaking not to
disturb them by force or threat of
force“ ch Preliminary session.
Mr. Bedcll Smith- Final Declara-
tion. John Foster Dulles. who had
for almost ii decade been de-
vcloping his policy of "contain-
ment", especially in light of the
success of the Chinese Revolution
in 1949, betrayed his real feelings
about Geneva two days after its
completion—“'l‘he conference rid-
vanccd the independent status of
South Vietnam to prevent the loss
of North Vietnam from leading to
the extension of Communism
throughout South East Asia."

Dulles warned the French that if
they were to retain any inﬂuence
in Vietnam, they must order the
hated Bao Dai to appoint Ngo
Dinh Diem as Prime Minister. This
was done and following a farcical
plebiscite in the South (contrary
to Geneva) Diem completely ous-
ted Bao Dai and was established as
“President, Prime Minister and
Minister of Defense" of the "Re-
publle of Vietnam" with the full

backng of the United States.

On February it, 1955, the tem-
porary government in Hanoi pro-
posed the restoration of normal
relations between the North and
Southern zones, for mail service,

roads, railroads, air and sea traffic
and so on. The proposal was
rejected. Hanoi also in 1955 urged
the South to participate in a
consultative conference in pre-
paration for 1956 nationwide
elections. This was rejected. Re-
peatedly in May and June of
1956, in Jilly 1957, in March of
1958, in July 1959, the govern-
ment in Hanoi made the same
offer. Each time it was met by a
refusal.

The reason, of course, was clear-
ly stated by President Eisenhower
in his book, Mandate for Change,
“Had elections been held, possibly
80% of the population would have
voted for the Communist, Ho Chi
Minli“. The primary feature of the
Geneva Agreement was the rccog~
nition that Vietnam was one
country rind one people. At the
time of Geneva. both the govern-
ment in Hanoi iind the Bao Diii
Regime in Saigon were claiming
sovereignty of the whole country.
The Geneva Conference made no
pronouncement on this question.
Specifically it was deferred to
July of 1956. when the matter
would be presented to the people
themselves iit a gcneriil clcction.

From the perspective of history.
i submit that the myth of the two

'Vietniims is the product of iipolo~

gists for American self-interest. in
following this course, we have put
ourselves squarely in line with all
foreigners—China, France and
Great Britain-Hwho liiivc unsuc-
ccsafully tried to manipulate Viet-
namese for its own purposes.

Yes? No? Yes?

To the Editor:

i read with great interest the
article “Only Yes Men Ap-
pointed" in last Friday’s ASP,
which was the latest installment
of the ASP's war on Mike
Lampcrt. I especially enjoyed my
characterization as a “Yes Man
to Mike—as i suppose did anyone
else who knows me and my vari-
ous periodic disagreemtns with
Mr. Lampcrt. The allegation is so
ridiculous that [see no reason to
prove anything here.

it surprises me, though, as a
former editor of the ASP, that the
ASP (or the few who control its
"news" policy) could claim that
its newsis fair or impartial. Com~
pare the two or three "get Lam-
pcrt" articles to the one poorly-
written “Lampcrt Offers De-
fense." The headlines, layout,
style of writing—mil are biased
intentionally to give Lampcrt the
greatest amount of bad publicity
and the least amount of good. is
this what the ASP calls fairness to
both sides?

Most of the criticism of Mike
Lampcrt centers around his failure
to do "enough"; he doesn‘t comv
municate enough, he doesn‘t rip-
point court justices enough, ctcct~
era. What surprises me is that
these criticisms came from the
mouths of a few elected officials
who, far from doing enough, linve
not done anything. The current

ASP philosophy seems to be to
concentrate on the jealousies of
the inactive few—whether they be
in the Central Council, the Senate,
or the Graduate School of Public
Affairs, or anywhere else. If the
ASP seeks fairness primarily, not
sensationalism or scandal, it
should allow all sides to be heard,
not amplify the mouthings of the
malcontents while misrepresenting
those who are too busy working
to engage in nonproductive de‘
bates.

it's unfortunate in some ways
that the administration of Mike
Lampcrt puts so little emphasis on
publicizing its achievements, be-
cause these far outweigh the few
shortcomings so loudly prirrotted
by a handful of publicity-seekers.
i have always been taught that
there are two kinds of people:
those who do the work, and those
who claim the credit; rind i‘vc
stuck with the ﬁrst group because
the competition is so much less.
This explains why people don‘t
hear or read so much about the
constructive things that the execu-
tive branch has done: we're too
busy working to shoot off our
mouths in self-praise. it‘s a pity
more of our “elected representa-
tives" don‘t do the same—We‘d
have a better Student Association
for it.

To the Editor:

It seems that our brothers up at;
State have learned a lot at the
institution, including elitism. and
the expert use of capitalism. The
whole concept of black weekend
was flawed since it made an ap-
parent efforts to incorporate the
brothers and sisters of Albany and
the rest of the area into its pro-
gram. The flaw became fatal when
the prices charged were so out-
ragiously high, and presented in
such an attitude of pay-up—or-get-
out.

Perhaps white culture can afford
to have an enlightened group that
decides what culture is for the
great unwashed masses, but the
entire concept of the negritude
movement is that true culture and
"folk-spirit" is inductive and
springs from the whole people to
form some general culture. Our
music, our religion, our style of
facing the myriad problems that
all too realistically confront us in
this world, all are informed by the

Bartenders

The Greed of the Whole Affair '.

unique and individual responses of
each brother ﬁnding his own solu-
tion to his own problem. That's
why any black weekend worthy
of the name must exhault all
brothers, and seek to incorporate
the participation of the entire
community. Less is a failure.

The greed of the whole affair is
symbolized by two events that

the full two dollars for people to
utter the dance being held in the
Campus Center. This at 2:30.a.m.,
when the dance was listed to end
at 3:30. What some did that
make.

The correction of these glaring
contradictions with the very con-
cept of negritude should help to
make yournext black weekend a

 

happened to me. First when I true success for all the people!

tried to enter into PAC to see the
dancers on Friday night, there was
no change for a ﬁve dollar bill. I
had $3.50 cash in change. As I
tried to either leave the line to go
and make change, else be allowed
to enter for less than the full four
dollars, I was decried for making
such a fuss about a dollar. “Such a
fuss about a dollar". laughable
statement, black folk seem to
have to scufﬂe for every cent, and
shouldn't be downed for trying to
spend their livelihood wisely.
Secondly, after the show (which
wm worth much more than the
entrace price) they were charging

as Effective as PhD's

To the Editor:

Several studies have come out in
the past few years showing that
people with limited professional
training (bar tenders rind house-
wives with six months experience)
are just as effective clinical thera-
pists us psychologists with PhDs.
In light of the usefulness of
psychological training at the
undergraduate level, the ﬁndings
are not that surprising.

What the student learns in grad-
uate schools often doesn‘t help
him in his final professional goal.
And, with respect to graduate
schools in psychology the intense
competition, the many difficult—
but use!!!“ -courses. and the hos-
tile, insensitive instructors, often
make their students worse thera-
pists than they would have been
before training.

The dilemma is that the clinical
psychologist is so sensitch about
his achievement that, during ther-
apy, he is defending his reputation
and liypotliese rather than coun-
scling his patient.

If graduate study in psychology
is more detrimental than bene»
ficiiil, perhaps we should ﬁnd
some other way of training and
certifying those people who want
to become clinical psychologists. i
am trying to contact individuals
interested in establishing this
"outer school" in psychology or
who know of any such project
already established.

votes on the proposal were 5-4,
including the vote on the ﬁnal
version of the bill. it is clear that
in their support of mandatory A-E
the Council was far from uniﬁed
grading. Secondly, the report
states ﬁgures from surveys on
student opinion of S-U grades
conducted everywhere except
here at Albany Stiitc. One must
question why ii referendum was
not conducted to determine stu-
dent opinion on mandatory A-E

 

grading especially when there was
a referendum conducted to survey
student opinion on the then pro-
posed S-U grading system in 1969.

The feeling 1 often get from the
proponents of the mandatory A-E
plan is that “we're going to make
it as tough on you as it was for
us." There are also some adminis-
tmtors and faculty whose sole
concern is the “academic image"
of this university. They seem will-
ing to toss out the window the
few academic innovations which
have made undergraduate academ-
ic life more liveablc here at
SUNYA.

Dissatisﬁed with the contents of
the bill and the report, some
members of the Undergraduate
Academic Council, Dr. Littlefield
of English, Dr. Wilken of Mathe-
matics, and students Debbie
Natrinsohn, Tom Signed: and
myself have written a "Minority"
Report which calls for an Ad Hoc
Committee on Grading which will
report directly to the Senate. This
report also calls for the continua-
tion of the present S-U system for
fmliman and sophomores, with

A'E grades by petition to the .

Committee on Academic Stand-
lng.
