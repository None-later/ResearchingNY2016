WASHINGTON AP - Home De-
mocrats described the bombing of
North Vietnam as a dangerous
escalation oi the war Thursday
mid ordered the prompt drafting
ofabillallingfortbeeomplete
11.6. withdrawal from Indochina.

'lhe resolution, apmoved 144 to
58 , w- tbe stronaat antiwar
action taken so far by the Home
Democratic 0am.

Adoption of the resolution,
which sho denounced the North
Vietnamese offensive, was by far
the law victory yet scored by
the antiwar forces in the House
and is evidence of their growing
strength.

Previotu end-the-war rue-urea
have paced the Senate only tobe
buried in the Home.

The Home Democrats' resolu-
tion declares “the national inter-

peace with security would best be
served by promptly settlng the
dateto terminate all US. military
involvement in and over Indo-
china, subjectonly to obtaining
the release of our prisoner: of war
and all available information on
the missing in action."

It directs the Foreigh affair:
Committee to report out a bill
designed to meet that objective,
an unprecedented action by the
caucus, which normally only re-
commends that its policies be
carried out.

The resolution was first adopted
135 to 66 as a substitute for a
resolution endorsing President
Nixon’s Vietnam policy. After the
addition of language condemning
what it called the invasion of
South Vietnam by North Viet-
nun, it picked up additional

at in obtaining a permnent strength.

Among those switching to sup-
port tlre resolution on the final
vote were Speaker Gad Albert.
D-Okla., and Majority Leader Hale
Boggs, D—La. it was their firat
break with administration policy
on Vietnam.

Although the rules of the cauctl
make it pomible to bind all Home
Democrats to follow caucus poli-
cies when it is adopted by a
two-thirds majority, exceptions
are allowed and it was clear they
would be invoked by members of
the Foreign Affair: Committee
who opposed the resolution.

No antiwar legislation has ever
been approved by the committee,
thus preventing the House from
dealing with the issue in a clear—
cut, head-on nranner. All its pre-
vious votes on Vietnam policy
have been procedural motions and
amendments to other bills.

WASHINGTON AP - President
Nixon is at the point of decision
on Vietnam - one that could have
a major impact not only on his
efforts to reshape U.S. relations
with Communist superpowers but
also on the domestic political
scene.

The President will disclose his
decision within 10 days, breaking
off public silence on the con-
tinuing North Vietnamese offen-
sive and on the Hanoi-Haiphong
bombing raids he ordered to coun-
ter the Communist thrust.

The announcement has been
planned since January under Nix-
on's troop-withdrawal schedule.
He will announce whether with-
drawals will continue after May 1.
But the message also will be a sign
to leaders in Moscow and Peking -

' and to the flock of Democratic

presidential hopefuls ~ of the
shape of Nixon's election - year
Vietnam policy.

While liouse aides insist the
chief executive has not reached a

 

withdrawal rate decision. Nor,

in combat are airmen and advisors
to South Vietnamese ground
units.

The number of American com-
bat dead last week was the same
as the week before, but the other
casualties raised the total to the
largest number since last October.

The South Vietnamese killed to-
tal last week was the highest since
the week of Feb. 4-10, 1968,
when 1,152 dead and 3,349
wounded were reported, along
with 13, 118 of the enemy killed.
They were the highest weekly
casualties in the war.

The allied commands now have
reported these total casualties for
the war:

American - 45,703 killed in ac-
tion, 302,915 wounded in action,
10,132 dead from nonhostile
causes.

SouthVietnamese - 139,456 kill-
ed in action, 352,529 wounded.

North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong - 815,780 killed.

Nixon Suns Himself,

Goes Booting,
Thinks

they say, has he set a date or
written a message for disclosing
his next step.

But Nixon‘watchers sense an air
of presidential decision-making.

Tuesday evening, Nixon went
for a cruise aboard the presiden-
tial yacht Sequoia, plying the wa-
ters of the Potomac below Wash-
ington without any of his advisers
along. Aides said later that he
worked on a briefcase filled with
papers.

Then Wednesday, the President
cruised the Potomac again, this
time with a key military aide just
back from Vietnam.

Nixon had dispatched Brig. Gen.
Alexander M. Halg Jr., No. 2 man
on the National Security Council
staff, and four Asian exports to
Vietnam a week ago on a fact--
finding mission.

Six hours after Haig returned to
Washington, he was aboard the
yacht with Nixon and H.R. Hul-
domnn, White House chief of
Staff, delivering a two-hour report
on his findings.
