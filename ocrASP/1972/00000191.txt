The State Lacrosse Team won
their ﬁrst conference game of the
season 10-6 against R.I.T.
Wednesday. The weather made
the field wet and the sod that was
kicked up made the field slow and
the play on ground balls sloppy
on both sides. The game had a
mixture of good hitting and many
scoring plays.

Albany jumped out in front on a
goal by John Wilcox, assisted by
Jim Miller at 1:30 of the first
period. Thirty-seven seconds later
Barry Sadoff took a pass from
Jeff O‘Donnell, in a Man Up
situation, and put it past the
R.I.T. goalie. Then R.I.T. went to
work scoring four goals before the
ﬁrst period ended.

The Albany Danes came back in
style from a disappointing loss on
Tuesday, as they shut out three
year SUNYAC champ Oneonta
1-0. Captain Nick Asciendo ran
his scoreless string to seventeen
innings, but needed a three inning
stint by Kevin Quinn to up his
record to 2-0.

Asciendo, pitching on only two
days rest, gave up an opening
single and then pitched six inning
of no-hit ball, before tiring. Quinn
started the seventh and immedi-
ately got himself into trouble by
giving up a lead off double. A
ground ball moved the tying run
to third, but Quinn cracked down
and retired the next eight batters
to clinch the victory.

Albany managed only four hits
off loser John Wilhelm, but made
them count. In the bottom of the
ﬁrst, Frank Castaldo drew a walk
and was sacriﬁced to second by
Howie Israel. Jack Leahy, hitting
at a .344 clip, then singled in the
game's only run.

This isn't the ﬁrst time that
Asciendo and Quinn have teamed
up for a whitewash. Earlier this
year, Quinn pitched the first five
innings of a 5-0 New I’altz shut-
out, and Asciendo commented
that he's “always happy to pitch
in front of or behind Quinn." I
would imagine that Quinn doesn't
mind either.

The Danes now stand at
.500(3-3-1) with Siena next on
the schedule for a home double-
header. The ﬁrst game begins at
1:00 and some support wouldn't
hurt the diamond - men's chances.

Batmen Split Pair; Nip Oneonta-

Coach Burlingame called it a
"typical Union game." Catcher
Jack Leahy thought it was pretty
sloppy. Whatever the case, Union
made up a 5-3 deﬁcit with 5 runs
in the eighth to overcome the
Great Danes 8-5. The loss left
Albany at 2-3-1 while Union won
its maiden game of the season. Vic
Errente lost his first start this year
while Joe Ursheli got the win in
relief.

Errcnte started out very shaky
in the first 3 innings, walking 5
and giving up 3 runs. He then
settled down as his teammates
started getting but. In the bottom
of the fourth Leahy doubled with
one out. Tony Tcdesco then beat
out an inﬁeld hit, as Leahy raced
to third. Two walks, it passed ball,
anti in throwing error later, the
score was knotted at 3 all.

Errcnte hung tough in the 5th
and 6th while Albany scored a run
in each. Vic Guiiinelli got a “rib-
bic" with a sac fly and Ray

Angrilla (2 for 3) doubled in a run
to chase out starter Bob Mitchell.
Mitchell remained in the game
though, and turned out to have
the last lauﬂt.

With two out and no one on in
the eighth, Errente fell apart. He
gave up a single, walk, double, and
another single to set the stage for
the turning point of the game.
The score was now 5-5 with mn-
ncrs on second and third and still
two out. Coach Burlingame con-
ferred with Errente and left him
in to face the next hitter,
Mitchell, who was 0 for 3.
Mitchell promptly ripped a tre-
mendous drive to center that out-
ﬁelder Tony Tedesco miracu-
lously got his glove on. But the
footing was slick on the wet grass,
and as Tony skidded so did the
ball. Mitchell made it all the way
around for a game winning homer.
Sweet revenge. Kenny La Roe
came in and pitched perfect ball
the rest of the way, but Joe
Urshcli held off the Danes to
preserve the Union win.

The Albany trackmen won again Wednesday afternoon but it was
not an impressive win. The score for the meet was Marist 18, Oneonta
60%, and Albany 102%. The score is little indication of the meet, as
Albany's superior depth gave them the win.

The meet started off badly as Albany was disqualified in the 440 yd.
relay for running out of the baton passing lane. To make matters
worse, Albany lost the 120 yd. hurdles rind it was clear that it was a
bad afternoon for the short distances. The short distance runner's still
hampered by the injuries to Cleve Little and Ed Williams failed to win
a race. Harvey Sobel picked up two seconds and Rhodell Richardson
anti Cliff McCard picked up a third. It‘or McCard it was a disappointing
day which was made worse by his failure to win the long jump.

It was the long jump and triple jump that helped Albany win the
meet. Led by Tom Walker's two victories Albany swept the triple
jump anti took first and fourth in the long jump.

The weights were the key are Albany swept the shot, discus and the
javalin. Itudy Vitlo for the second straight meet, broke his school and
track record with a toss of 4H'2" in the shot.

Don Van Cleve finished second to Rudy untl then won the discus
before wrapping up the day with a third in the juvclin which was won

by Ross Andersen of Albany.

Brian Quinn again provod he's the team's bth long distance man
with a double victory in the 2 mile and the mile. It was in the mile
that Ilriun set a new Albany record with a 11:22.6 and then with a
9:40 he not a new record for the two mile.

The rniddltI distances were again strong with Sal Rodriguez and Rich
Ilower leading the way in the 440 and 880. Both joined Brad Peak
and Peter I’ayne, who arrived just in time, to loud the team to a win in

the mile relay.

This Saturday the Albany trackmen take on Sicna anti I’lattsburgh
home while at the same time the J.V. meets Cohletikill homo.
