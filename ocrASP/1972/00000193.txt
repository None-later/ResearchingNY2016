A bill aimed at halting the
levying of a mandatory activities
fee at SUNY campuses narrowly
passed the State Senate Friday
after over two hours of debate.

Proponents of the measure,
sponsored by Cornwall Repub-
lican Senator Richard
Schermerhorn, cited radical and
obscene publications, radical
speakers and the chartering of
buses for anti-war rallies as
reasons for killing the mandatory
assessment. They claimed that stu‘
dents should not be forced to pay
for activities which they did not
support or believe in.

Opponents of the measure
claimed that the right to levy the
tax was anexercise in self-govern-
ment, and should be permitted so
that students could learn about
the workings of a democracy.

Senate Minority Leader Joseph
Zartzki (D. -Manhattan) speaking
against the bill called attention to
the results of referendums held at
SUNY campuses on the tax issue.
In an attempt to counter claim
that students were opposed to the
fee, he cited figures indicated that
39% of the students voting at
SUNY Binghamton wanted the
mandatory fee, 45% of the
Cortland student body voted for
the fee, at Geneseo 44% voted for
the mandatory tax, Potsdam stu-
dents voted 14 to 1 - or 71% - for

the mandatory fee, at the Mari-
time College the vote was 6 to 1
in favor of the fee, and at the two
year school at Morrisville - where
freshmen voted on the tax issue -
the results were 24 to 1 in favor
of a mandatory fee.

Zaretzki stated that the ﬁgures
revealed that more students came
out to vote on the tax issue than
people who turn out to vote in
general elections. The Senator
continued, "...we would be glad
to have this on the Democratic
side..."

The Minority Leader also
pointed out that the campuses
must abide by regulations con-
cerning how often referendums
must be held on the tax issue, and
concerning the uses and disburse-
ments of the money collected. He
also claimed that even when the
tax was voluntary 76% of the
students contributed anyway.
Continuing the Senator stated
that the mandatory tax program
should be given more time since
the regulations concerning ref-
erendums and disbursements of
fees had only been in effect for
one year. He stated, "...maybe
democracy doesn’t work...but
let's give the future leaders a
chance..."

In summing up his arguments
against the measureL_the Senator
said, “We must give the student a
chance to learn how to govern
himself because he can govern
us...We must give democracv a

State University at the York at Albany _

chance to work even if it some-
times rubs us wrong..."
The Vote
The vote on the measure was a
slow roll call, and several Senators
requested that their names be

called so they might explain their '

vote. Senator Joseph Galiber (D.
-Bronx) voted against the
measure, and stated that they
were dealing with "...a crisis not
in conduct but in values..." and
continued, "...this is a very bad
bill...” Senator Robert Garcia (D.
-Bronx) opposed the measure and
stated "...elected officials are im-
posing on the campuses...shame
on you..." Republican Senator
Leon Giuffreda voted“ayc...with-
out shame." Democrat James
Griffin voted for the bill claiming
that a small minrity of students
controlled the fees and because of
this the money could be mi-
s-appropriated. New York Demo-
crat A. Frederick Meyerson voted
against the bill charging that the
lawmakers were afraid of the stu-
dents and had no faith in them.
Democrat Lawrence Murphy
voted for the measure terming the
levying of mandatory fees
"tyranny of a demand for money
from a group on an individual..."
and continued, “I stand by the
individual."

Senate Majority Leader Earl
Brydges (R. Niagara Falls), was
called to the chamber to cast his
needed " ye" vote. Senator
Ronald S afford (it. ‘Clinton

County), head of the Senate Com-
mittee on Higher Education voted
for the measure. Senator Thomas
Laverne (R. -Rochester), head of
the Senate Education Committee,
spoke against the measure and did
cast a “no” vote. Albany Repub-
lican lawmaker Walter Langley
voted in favor of the measure. The
measure passed 29 to 18.
Assembly Action

The bill must now go before the
Assembly for action, but its
chances of passage in this chamber
appear dim. Assemblywoman
Constance Cook (R. ~Tioga and
Tompkins County), head of the
ch amber’s Education
Committee--from which the tax
bill must be released for floor
action--stated that she was against
the measure. Noting that the fees
support what she termed “a very
important part of the educational
program..." including lectures and

Tuesday, Aprll 25, 1912

 

concerts, she stated that any
measure doing away with the fees
“must make other provisions..."
so that these activities would not
be killed as well. A measure simi-
lar to the Schermerhorn bill was
killed in the Assembly Education
Committee earlier in the session.

When asked to comment on the
Senate bill, Deputy Assembly
Minority Leader Albert
Blumenthal (D. -New York)
stated, “...it is a mistake to de-
prive students of this right" [the
right to levy a mandatory fee].

Assemblyman Milton Jonas (R.
Nassau), head of the Joint Legis-
lative Committee on Higher Edu-
cation, expressed opposition to
the bill, and after a quick talk
with Assemblywoman Cook in
which it was determined that the
measure had been killed in com-
mittee, expressed strong doubts
that the bill would ever reach the
floor for action.

Students March on Federal Building

 

by Glenn von Nostitz

The scene was strangely reminis
cent of 1970. The chants were the

’ same, the route was identical, and

the target was again the Federal
Building at the corner of State
and Broadway. The 800 demon-
strators were once again marching
down Washington Avenue, Friday
at noon, and wore once again
protesting an escalation of the
Indochina War.

This year the demands included:

1) Immediate and total with-
drawnl of all American troops and
material, and acceptance of the
Provisional Revolutionary Govern-
ment’s seven point peace plan,

3) An immediate and to United
States domination of the political,
economic, and social systems of
the world,

3) An immediate and to the
political, social, and economic
suppression 01' people in this

‘ 1 country.

The march began at the uptown
campus with fewer than 500 stu-
dcnts, continually picking up mo-
mentum and people as it moved
toward the Capitol. Traffic was

i disrupted along Washington Ave-

nuc and in front of the Federal

 

Building, where the marchers
stopped to hear a list of demands
being read. An anti-war slogan was
spray-painted on the main en-
trance to the Federal Building,
and the marchers left signs with
Maoist slogans near the other
doors. A confrontation was
avoided when a man proposing
repeal of the abortion laws took a
bulihorn in his hand, climbed on
top of a car, and began speaking

against legalized abortion. He was

persuaded to stop his speech after
being repulsed with loud boos and
heckling from the hostile crowd.

in spite of the clear, sunny
weather, the mood of the partici-
pants secmed serious. Clich‘ul
chants of “Peace, Now“ and
“i-‘Z-ll-ii-we don't want your fuck-
ing war" informed spectators
along the route what the partici-
pants stood for. Leaﬂets were also
passed out to people driving by in
cars. The march was generally
orderly and accompanied by the
usual police escorts. Bystanders
appeared unaffected and perhaps
a bit bored as the demonstrators
marched past homes, stores, and
offices along the route. Hons"
ewives came out onto porches, old
men stopped raking lawns, and
office workers peered down from
unner stories of office huililinns as

the marchers passed below them.
There was one minor incident
when an irate motorist attempted
to drive around a group of stu-
dents blocking his car, and ended
up crashing into the car ahead of
him. His misfortune was met by
loud cheers from nearby march-
ers.

At several buildings along the
route, including the Navy-Army-
Air Force Reservn Center and the
Internal Revenue Service, march-
ers placed signs with Maoist slo-
gans on the doors and windows.

After rallying for about 15 min-
utcs at the Federal Building, the
demonstrators proceeded back up
State Street to the lBM Building,
where they staged another brief
rally and placed signs on the doors
and windows. Curious office
workers peered down at the pro-
tcstors through tightly sealed win-
(lows.

Throughout the duration of the
march, there were no confronta-
tions between marchers and the
police. The police did experience
some problem, however, in keep-
ing the marchers from occupying
the entire width of the street.

And what did the people watch
ing the march think? Some
