machinery necessary to their
course. This has all been covered
in a general lab fee which has
become very controversial. Torn
O'Connor, program director of
studio courses, spoke for a group
of professors who refuse to charge
lab fees and are even willing to
close the shops if no money can
be found to run them. And even
Dean Hunsberger admitted that he
doubts the legality of such a fee.

Another issue is the lack of
teachers and courses, and the lack
of graduate assistants. The luttcr
are needed to supervise the shops,
which will be closed if there is no
supervision. There have been
many thefts as well as vundulisms.

Whether or not the meeting was
successful still has to be deter-

over by Eric Stogo, was able to
present its case and prove to the
administration that the art depart-
ment, faculty and students, is a
united group. Most important,
they succeeded in holding up ul-
locations, which were due April 1,
so that Hunsberger could review
the situation. However, he
couldn't promise that the new

in considering the needs of the art

needed funds, the Art Council
promises to continue to not until
their demands are met.

The art department is, surpri-
singly, one of the larger depart-
ments on campus. This semester

Allen Center Prepares

The new James E. Allen Jr.
Collegiate Center, named for the
late U.S. Commissioner of Educa-

year of "intellectually integrated
interdisciplinary education." Ac-
cording to the Dean of the Center,
Seth W. Spelman, the curriculum
content is in the process of being
identified by the 24 member in-
structional staff.

On Wednesday the staff will be
meeting with the 11th grade pu-

that age group's curriculum inter-

the time-shortened baccalaureate
program will also contribute their

TUESDAY, APRIL 25, 1972

 

 

by John Fairhall

The popular trend toward off-
campus student living may soon
overwhelm the local housing mar-
ket. According to a survey of
off-campus living done by the
Ofﬁce of Residence “Our current
population of 3,344 Off-campus
'students will...more than double‘
while the Urban Planning Council
of Albany estimates that there
will not be a significant increase in
the number of apartment units
within a student's price range."

The survey further predicted
that “students may find it impos-
sible to attend the State Univer-
sity of New York at Albany as a
result of a housing shortage." This
spells trouble for the university as
well: unfilled rooms mean a ser-
ious loss of revenue. As reported
in the ASP, there is a bill before
the state legislature that would
make dormitory living mandatory.

Tight Housing Situation

Even now, students are finding
it difficult to obtain housing at
reasonable prices. Of the 1941
persons who responded to the
survcy questionnaire, 49% indic-
ated difficulty in locating housing
while 37% indicated extreme-dif-

ficulty. The students polled rep-
resented 38% of the total off-
campus student population. A-
bout 3370 of the respondents were
commuting students, as opposed
to those who live off-campus but
do not reside at home.

Of those surveyed who lived in
apartments, approximately 46%
livcd in furnished apartments,
while 54% lived in unfurnished
facilities. The most popular living
urea wasAlbany; Schenectady was
a very distant second. The private
auto is the main transportation
although a large number of
students rely on the university
bus. Most off-campus students re-
ported commuting time as 15
minutes or more.

Suburbs welcome Students

Students will soon be pushed to
outlying suburbs in the quest for
decent housing. Joseph Scaring,
director of the Office for Off-
-Campus Housing, notes that there
are many apartment complexes in
the suburbs that would welcome

students—if students had trans '
portation. However, buses do no

yet connect the suburbs to th
campus, whichvmeans the crowd-

ed Albany housing situation will ,_

not likely change. Landlords can
charge exhorbitant rates for space
near the campus or the university
bus route.

The survey was designed to det- “
ermine number of single and mar- ,

ricd students, the type and cost of
apartments they reside in, the size
of their family or number of
roommates. the type of transport-
ation used to and from campus
and any problems they encounter-
ed obtaining off-campus housing.

Included in the survey are
housing predictions for the year
1974-75. Albany State is expected
to have an enrollment— under-
graduates und graduates—of
16,720. It is estimated that
10,694 of these students will live
off-campus (this figure includes a
projected commuter population
of 3,56”.

More Housing Needed

More non-dormitory housing for
students is needed, but it is not on
the way. One answer would be the
improvement of public transport-
ation to the campus. For now.
students must scramble for the
high-priced space near the cum-
pus. Scuring‘s office can assist
students—in fact, it is a good
starting point from which to begin
the search for an apartment or
house. The ofﬁce maintains a lis-
ting of available housing and
Scaring himself is very knowledge
nblc about the local housing sit-
uution. He is familiar with housing
laws and knows many of the
area‘s landlords. Infortunately,
Scaring’s office can not overcome
the basic problem the need for
more housing for on expanding
student population.
