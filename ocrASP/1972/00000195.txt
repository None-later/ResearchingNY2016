-majorlty of students on ' this
campus lrnow little about their
2 student government, and many
don’t know who the student as-
sociation president“ and " student
representatives are, i wonder
whether or not the student go-
vernment is relevant. A vast
beaurocratic organisation exists in
this University and I find it ques-
tionable as to whether or not the
government relates at all to stu-
dent. Granted, many students are
indeed apathetic, yet many stu-
dents feel that the student govern-
ment consists of a few elite:
students who may serve their own
interests more than the intersts of
the student body.

The Central Council of the legis-
lative arm of the student associ-

from the cum we pay for, and

the radio station and papers we
may listen to or read, students can
rightfully wonder-what exactly is
the purpose and relevance of the
student government. Most stu.
dents feel that they have abso-
lutely no contact or inﬂuence on
the decisions that are being made
in their own behalf.

Our student government has
failed to assert strong leadership
in instances where it was desper-
ately needed. They have failed to
be the vanguard of the tuition
issue and at best have been wishy-
washy with the entire affair. if we
can’t look to the student associa-
tion for support, who can we
expect to assume leadership?

I do not feel that the student
government or association should
be disbanded by any means. Even
a poor student government is het-

,w elevant is “Student A85

ter than no student government at
all. But , the Ieaderdiip should
attempt;to bring themuives out
of their beaucroeratic cubby-holes

I and get back into the needs of all

the students, and not just of few
students and organizations. Stu-
dent shouid be given the oppor-

tunity to actually vote, directly -

by referendum, on issues that will
affect them and one or two
people in the student anociation
mould by no means speak for the
student body when in turbidity."
they are only speaking for them-
selves. it is also the responsibility
of students. however, to become
involved in university affairs and
to find out what the issues are and
the politics behind the issues.
Only then will we have attained a
truly representative and relevant
student government.

SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP) -Apollo 16 astronauts rocket
out of lunar orbit Monday night
aboard their command ship, Cas-
per and start the 66-hour,
240,000-mile voyage home with a
record cargo of rocks.

The men of Apollo 16-John W.
Young, Charles M. Duke Jr. and
Thomas K. Mattineg iI—fire the
once bothersome command ship
rocket engine, which had delayed
the moon landing last Thursday.
to pull out of the moon's gravity
and speed toward a splashdown in
the South Paciﬁc this Thursday.

Tucked into Casper's hold were
245 pounds of rock and miles of
black and white and color film
taken on the moon. Geologists
believe the rocks may tell the
story of how volcanoes wracked
the moon 4-4.5 billion years ago
to mold lunar mountains and
carve canyons and valleys.

Young and Duke collected the
moon material during their 71-
hour stay in the Descartes Moun-
tsin region of the moon. They
lifted off Sunday night from the
highlands, a major portion of the
moon that had never been visited
before, in their lunar module,
Orion. With that cargo aboard,
they had achieved the primary
goal of the mission.

Duke and Young spent much of
the day transferring their moon
specimens into Casper.

Apollo 16's stay in moon orbit

was shortened by almost 25 hours
because of the problem discovered
before the moon landing last
Thursday in the backup control
system of Casper's main rocket
engine. The engine has fired prop-
erly twice since then and the
condition is not considered ser-
ious. But to guard against the
possible chance of the engine con-
dition worsening, officials ordered
Apollo 16 to rocket home a day
early.

Splashdown is set for 2:44 p.m.
EST Thursday.

Tuesday afternoon on the way
back to earth, Mattineg will walk
in space to recover ﬁlm from a
$1.2-million array of cameras and
scientiﬁc instruments in an out-
side bay of Casper. The astronaut
will leave the hatch of the com-
mand ship, inch back along the
craft’s side, remove two canisters
of ﬁlm and return them to the
safety of Casper’s cabin.

In another space development
Monday, ofﬁcials at the Minned
Spacecraft Center announced that
American and Soviet space ex-
perts have agreed to construct a
scale model of a proposed com‘
mon space docking system. The
move is viewed as a forerunner to
a possible U.S.-Russian joint mun-
ned space flight in 1975.

The agreement came in a set of
reports springing from a meeting
lst year in Moscow of American
and Soviet space engineers. it was
the third such meeting and anoth-
er is planned for this summer.

WESTCHESTER, Pa. (AP)-Sen
George S. McGovern predicted to-
day u clean sweep in Tuesday’s
Massachusetts primary and said it
would be "a happy day” in Penn-
sylvania as well.

McGovern launched an eight-
city bid to score a Pennsylvania
surprise win with speeches to en-
thusiastic groups in industrial
Chester and in the southeastern
Pennsylvania town about 30 miles
from Philadelphia, before heading
west for Lancaster, Harrisburg and
Pittsburgh.

Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, who
some think is the favorite to win
\the Pennsylvania balloting, left
Pittsburgh for a helocopter tour
of southwestern Pennsylvania.

Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, who is
banking heavily on television ap-
peals in Pennsylvania's major cit-

in Philadelphia, then flew to Pitta-

year in the line of duty.

Cardillo, 31, was shot in the
chest April 14 duringastruggie in
a Black Muslim mosque in Har-
lem. He died last Thursday in St.
Luke 's Hospital.

The incident in the mosque pre-
cipitated a disturbance in the
nearby Harlem streets.

Also present at the funeral was

NEW YORK (AD—Tom Wicker,
associate editor of the New York
Times. said Monday the most
“grievous failing” of the Ameri-
can news medi' is reliance on
ofﬁcial sources and “official attit-
udes."

Wicker commented before an
estimated 600 persons attending
the final session here of the two-
day A.J. Liebllng “Counter-
Convention" held at the Martin
Luther King Labor Center.

The conference, sponsored by
MORE, 1: weekly journalism re-
view, coincided with thc opening
Monday of the annual meeting of
the American Newspaper Publish-
ers Association.

Wicker said many editors had
fallen into the grasp of "spurious
objectivi‘r," limiting reporters
while relying on official versions
of the news.

"it's a copout, a retreat from
trying to write the news the way
only a reporter can get at it," he
said. “We must insist that some-
how we have i. tn be set free to
do our work,“ icker added.
