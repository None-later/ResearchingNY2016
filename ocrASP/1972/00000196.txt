 ’72--

THE ULTIMATE IN YEARBOOKS

 

FUNDED BY STUDENT TAX

 

As you’ll recall... at last word we were waiting [0‘
the capitalist pigs to ship the covers to Charlotte.
North Carolina. well, good news, the covers arrived
Saturday at 11 am. Now we’re waiting for the
downtrodden masses (i.e. the trucking union) to
unload the truck. They refuse to unload it until the
next workday, Monday. So, ﬁguring one day to glue
the books, - and two days to get them from
North Carolina to here, we should get them on
Thursday, plus one day to get organized, we should
start giving them out on Friday...God willing.

Next, we still don't know where they are going to
be given out, but it will be one of two places: in
front of the bookstore tunnel window, or in CC 305
(probably, 305). Only people with both fall and
spring tax cards may pick up the book on Friday.
The others will have to check Friday’s ASP for their
times.

The letters to the editor (pro and con) will be at
the information desk by Friday morning, along with
a box to deposit them in. To better enjoy a
completely unique experience, may we offer a few
suggestions...

1) Allow yourself at least 30 to 45 minutes to read
the book (there are alot of words, at times).

2) Don’t flip through the book. Start at page 1, and
work your way through. Torch '72 is designed to
have a certain “flow of logic”. There are happy parts
and sad parts. It’s hard at times, to appreciate one
section without seeing the section before it. (Besides,
knowing our luck, you’ll probably hit one of the
depressing areas and be bias toward the rest of the
book)

3) Don’t scream outloud as you read it, other
people who haven‘t seen it may overhear you, giving
the results of Number 2 (see above).

4) Don't run and call your parents. We’re all mature
adults now, and should be able to handle our own
affairs. (Besides if you can’t handle it, what makes
you think they can?)

5) If you should start to vomit, run outside and do
it on the grass. (Torch ’72 is a firm believer in
recycling wastes).

6) Relax, calm down and finish the book if you
hadn't (It gets happy at the end.)

7) Be careful not to knock someone down as you
run to the campus center to write your opinion. You
might drop the book, the wind might blow it open,
and someone might see it, giving the results of
Number 2 (see above).

8) Write calmly and clearly. Tell us what you
liked, and the “little” you didn’t like. Please use
words mentioned in the current edition of Webster’s,
only.

9) Go to the infirmary, and tell them what
happened. They'll give you a sedative made especially
for us. Go back to your room, and go to bed. (the
next day it will all seem like a bad dream.)

10) Read the future editions of the ASP and
Sweetfire, we may print some of the more common
opinions and give our excuses.

See you Friday, (we hope!)
love,

The people who saw it coming,
and turned on the fan,

Torch ’72.

"incomes confront Legislators;   ~
Action Taken on Pension Reform packa  T 

by Vicki Zeldln
Capital Correspondent

A veritable smorgasbord was the
menu of events served up at lut
week's session of the New York
State legislature.

The week began with a call by
several legislators for a full investi-
gation of the events and situation
at SUNY Coblesklll. The campus
had been torn by racial strife
resulting in damage estimated at
over $10,000.

Abortion Appeals

Monday saw a demonstration at
the Capitol by members of an
anti-abortion group-Right to
Life--calling for the repeal of the
state's two year old liberal abor-
tion law. Several hundred
Right-to-Lifers rallied at the Capi-
tol steps. Two area priests were
arrested for blocking an entrance
to the building, but were Inter
released on their own recogni-

'l‘uesday a contingent of young
RiﬂIt-to-Llfers converged on the
Capitol seeking legislative support
for their demand that the
Donovan-Crawford bill - which
would repeal the current abortion
law - be missed from committee.
Several female members of the
group gained access to the Assem-
bly floor, and refused to leave.
The Assembly adjourned while
the protestors were bodin re-
moved from the chamber.

Other Action

Other legislative action
included:

«Senate approval of the pro
posed U.S. constitutional
ammendment guaranteeing equal
rights for women. Three Senators
voted against the measure. The
bill now goes to the Assembly.
Fourteen states have already rati-
ﬁed the amendment.

é-‘l‘he Alemny Codes Commit-
tee reported out-e bill that would
restore the death penalty for mor-
der convictions in the state. The
measure would require a judge to
sentence a convicted murderer to
death unless the jury recom-
mends a life sentence. Currently
only persons convicted of killing
an on-duty policeman or a person
serving a life sentence who kills a
prison guard are subject to capital
punishment.

~The Assembly acted on a
package of pension reform
measure proposed by the Republi-
can leadership. The approved
measure, that now must go before
the Senate, would forbid pension
payments to retired public em-
ployees who receive over a certain
limit for consulting work for the
government or who return to a
public post in certain instances.
The measures also prohibit new

‘ of the legislative pension
plan after July 1 from receiving
retirement credit for prior govern-

ment service.

--A measure that would, for the
ﬁrst time, allow SUNY facility
members pay checks to be gur-
nishcd in order to pay campus
parking lines has been approved
and Sent to the Governor.

--Thc legislature has received
several proposals from the (lover-

 

nor dealing with a massive reform
of the state's judicial system, and
other proposals aimed at re-
forming the state's prison com-
plex.

Session’s End

The session, which has been
gearing up its activities in an
attempt to close operations
shortly, still has to grapple with a
variety of meaty legislation in—
cluding:

--a constitutional amendment to
allow casino style gambling cur-
rently prohibited in the state;

—some type of no-fault’.‘ auto
insurance nae-sire; --'~

--the Governor's supplemental
budget;

—somc type of aid formula for
the state's non-public schools:

as well as a variety of ﬁcom-
mendations emanating from the
Governor's ofﬁce dealing with
prisons and the courts.

Sources indicate that the leaders
hope to adjourn this year's session
within another two weeks.

Now that cases of smallpox have been reported on the continent ol‘
Europe, it seems urgent that our students planning to travel this
slimmer, even though limiting their excursions to the continent of
Europe and not going into Yugoslavia, Pakistan or other areas where
smallpox has been more prevalent right along, should obtain vaccina-

Wc are urging all student travelers abroad to report to the Student
l-lcalth Service as soon as possible for this vaccination so that they
may havu a reading well before their departure. It takes approximately
a week to bc surr- of a satisfactory "Luke" and in the event that
rcvnccimrlion is indicated for some reason, more time is needed.
