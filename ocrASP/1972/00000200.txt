TUESDAY. APRIL 25. 1972

 

 

 

by Mindy Altman

It aeema, according to some,
that for the coming full term,
there will be more SUNYA stu-
dents living off-campus than ever
before. At least that is the im-
preseion held by Joseph Scaring,
the Assistant Director for off-
campua housing.

According to Scaring, students
are looking earlier for off-campus
apartments and houses. Generally,
students would come in the sum-
mer to look for Off-campus hous-
ing, but now moat are making
arrangements earlier even taking
the responsibility of subletting
places for the summer. Scaring
believes that one of the reasons
that more students are interested
in living offcampua is because of

 

the increase in room rates. He
predicts that a larger percentage of
students than in previous years
will be living off-campus thia com-
ing fall.

0n the other hand, Dr. Charles
Fisher, Director of Residence,
does not think the situation will
be too much different this fall
than it has been in previous years.
According to Fisher. about two-
thirda of the students living on
campus during the year, return to
campus the following year. He
does not see these numbers chang-
ing for the coming fall. In fact, he
feels that the housing situation is
not at all bad. contrary to what
some people seem to think.
“Right now." said Fisher, “our
occupancy level is low, down to
about 89% in fact, as of March 1.

But thin in only becauae the uni-
veraity is not. like the open market
where there in aiwaya input and
output. Whatever atudenta the
university loses during the coume
of the year are not really replaced
again until the new fall term.
when all the dorms are ﬁlled up."
Fisher believe that the only dif-

ference in the situation from that v

of previous years in that new
housing is more available than
enrollment; position: in previou-
yeara enrollment poeitiom were
more available than housing. “in
is one of the requ why Mohawk
Tower on Indain Quad will not be
open in the fall. The 420 bed!
that the Tower has to offer in not
needed for the 1972-73 academic
year at thia point.

people believe that vacanclea are
caning a acme problem and, in
0rd: to help correct them, the
university would form 3’ policy
that would not allow ﬁmhmen to
live off-campus, no auch

in policy are about to he formu-
latcd.

Both Scaring and Fisher believe
that having an off-umpua housing
policy for all student in good.
Fisher in particular any- that peo-
ple can not be "cublry holed" and
that living off-compile ia a ﬁne
