Danes win;

O’DOnneII Nels 4 1

The Albany State lacrosse team
upped its league record to 2-0 as
the stickmen defeated Hartwick
College 8-4 in a game held here
last Saturday.

It was not an ideal day for a
lacrosse game. The weather was
cold, windy and rainy. Most of
the spectators who did come to
the game left at halftime .

Once again the star of the game
was co-captain Jeff O’Donell. Jeff
scored four goals and assisted on
mother. Jim Miller continued his
ﬁne play at attackman with a goal
and two assists.

Coach Bob Ford called this
game “Our sloppiest game of the
year." Ford felt that the key to
the game was our man down
defense. Eight times Albany was
short a man and Hartwick was
only able to score one goal and
manage six shots at the net.

The game was a very physical
contest as there was hitting all
over the ﬁeld. After the game
many of the players walked off
with bumps and bruises. Near the
end of the first half, the game got
too 'rough when a fight broke
out in front of the Hartwick goal.
All players on the field jumped
into the melee but order was soon
restored. Both coaches should be
commended for discouraging the
ﬁght. The benches wanted to help
their teammates out but Coach
Ford and the Hartwick coach
stopped their teams from going on
to the ﬁeld.

The first quarter was all Albany
as the Danes constantly put on
the pressure. Almost all of the
action was near Harwick's goalie.
The game was less than two min-
utes old when O'Donnell blasted a
shot to give Albany an early lead.

At 8:45 O'Donnell scored his sec-
ond goal of the game on a find '
individual effort. Tom Mullin
closed the scoring for the quarter
after taking a pass from Jim Mil-
ler.

It looked like it would be an
easy day for goalie Tom Hcister
but Hartwick was able to break
the ice in the second quarter on a '
goal by Rich Lapham. However
Albany continued to dominate.
Off the face-off, the Danes
charged down the field and
O'Donnell found Jules Scheider
for the Danes fourth goal. Albany
scored a few minutes later on
some good pass work by Jim
Miller. Miller from behind the
Hartwick net fed John Wilcox,
who was standing in front, for the
score. O'Donnell added a goal in
the closing seconds to give Albany
9 6-1 halftime lead.

Trackmen Score Easy Win

by Kenneth Arduino

The Albany State track team
dominated the triangular track-
meet last Saturday by whipping
Plattsburg and Siena by the score
of 111 pts to 33 pts to 36 pts.
respectively.

Albany Won every event except
the pole vault, the mile run and
the mile relay. But in the pole
vault and the mile run, Albany
took both second and third. The
Albany domination was also evi-
dent in the fact that Albany
placed at least two people in each
event except the 400 hurdles
which Albany placed only the
winner Bob Mallory.

Dave Reynolds was one of two
individuals to win a double for
Albany as he tied his own record
with a high jump of six feet-two
inches. Dave got his other victory
later when he won the triple
Jump.

The other dual winner was Sal
Rodriguez who won both the 440
yd. and 880 yd. run. Sal, only a
junior, ran the 800 for the ﬁrst
time this year and responded
with a fine victory.

As usual Rudy Vido broke the
school and track record in the
shot. This time he made it by two
feet with a toss of 50 ft., 6%in.
Rudy is undefeated and a toss of

 

56 feet seems believable before
the end of the season.

Versatile Don Van Cleve picked
up a chunk of point with a ﬁrst in
the discus, a second in the javelin
and a third in the shot. Rou
Andersen won the javelin to com-
plete the Albany sweep in the
throwing: events.

The sprinters, unlike their last
meet where they failed to win,
swept the sprints and short races.
Cliff McCard won the 100 yd.
dash, Lec Kardes won the 120 yd.
hurdles and Harvey Sobel won the
220 yd. run. They were joined by
Dave 'l‘cllicr, Tom Moore and Bob
Malone as Albany won eight of a
possible nine places in the sprints.

Brian Quinn's streak in the
mile was not broken even though
Albany failed to win the mile.
Quinn was held out by Coach
Munscy so that he could run the
three mile, which he won.

The J.V. team was unable to
stay with a tough Delhi team and
was only able to ﬁnish second in
the triangle meet also held here
Saturday. The Scores were Delhi
106, Albany 52, and Coblcskill
20. The J.V. is now I-2.

'l‘hc vamity is now 5-0 and has
won 29 straight. Their next match
is Wednesday at Queens college.
