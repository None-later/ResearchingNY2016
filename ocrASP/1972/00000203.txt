by Ann E. Bunker

Friday afternoon marked the dedication
of Indian (bred. The traditional corner-
stone-laying ceremony was enlivened by
the actions of a handful of demonstrators,
and the arrival of an evening gown-clad
mystery lady and eiﬂit lndlans.

A small crowd began to gather lust prior
to the scheduled event, and in the avail-
able time the anti-war demonstrators men-
eged to get ehold of some tape and effix a
sign reading, "1872-lndians, 1972-Asians:
A Century of Progress in American Mur-
der" to the lactern. where it remained
throughout the dedication.

Having accomplished this, the crowd
milled around restlessly. it was not long,
however, before certain dignitaries began
to arrive, providing a momentary diver-
sion. The hiyl point of this stage was the
arrival of an elegantly-dressed matron,
who somehow managed to make us jean--
clad hippies conspicuous.

it was not long after that, when a rustle
of awe went through the crowd, "Look,
Indians!" The next few minutes were
spent in high excitement as necks craned
to get a glimpse of the newcomers. To
facilitate matters, the lndians obligingly
filed up onto the podium in front of us
where we could ogle them to our hearts'
delight. It was at this point that the formal
dedication began.

The ceremony was opened by Quad
Coordinator Dave Jenkins, who offered
the opening prayer and introduced Quad
" ' ’ r ' r Kenny " L '
Schulmen's remarks were confined mainly
to the strike and the anti-war concerns of
the day. In closing, he dedicated the Quad
to the "struggle for human freedom and
peace."

Dave Jenkins again had the floor and
proceeded to run down the list of items
placed in the sealed cornerstone box.
included were such items as a c0py of the
Quad Association Constitution, an Indian
feather headband, Bob Brody's first an-
nual report on "four-plus-two", an ad for
Henway's, a strike poster, an empty Maxi~
mus Super can and an incriminating ciga-
rette. Added to the articles was a plaque
placed in the cornerstone Friday morning
by anti-war activists.

Walter Tisdale, the man in charge of
campus planning, and Vice President for
University Affairs Lew Welch had a few
remarks to add, and there was some
passing back and forth of the keys to the
quad, which only added to the solemnity
of the occasion. Mr. Tisdale attempted to
explain the choice of the name "lndian"
for the Quad and discussed the choice of
carpet patterns. Mr. Welch’s remarks were
brief, after which Ken Schulman placed
the box in the cornerstone. A benediction
by Rabbi Joel Chassin concluded the
ceremony.

Following the dedication, there was an
"lndian dinner” served in the Quad dining
room, where residents and giasts alike
sampled Food Service's delicacies. At 7
p.m., skin-designer Tom Two-Arrows end
his friends offered some authentic Indian
dances in the flag room, thus concluding
the festivities.

 

 

 

 

Editorial Note

lhe night before the Indian
Quad cornerstone was to be laid
and the dedication of SUNYA's
last residence quadrangle com-
pleted, a group of students got
together, in typical conspiratorial
fashion, and laid their own corner-
stone. There were no speakers, no
speciai dinners, no rallies, no
crowds. There weren’t even any
Indians. For what it was worth,
there was just a cement slab that
was propped forlornly against the
back wall of the space set aside
for the "official" stone. Any curi-
ous student who noticed the new-
comer Friday morning on his way
to class read these words:

April let, 1972

"We the students of the State
University of New York at Albany
dedicate Indian Quad to the
memory of all human lives which
perish and continue to perish in
the unjust imperialistic aggression
waged on the people of Southeast
Asia by the United States of
America. May this cornerstone be
the foundation on which our
generation and all future genera-
tions build a world of the peace
and lustlce we now struggle for. "

The War C

Albany: New Protest Planned

It was about this time two years
ago, on a gentle spring day, that
four students were shot to death
at Kent State University. And it
was at the same time that United
States troops crossed the Viet-
namese border into Cambodia, sig-
nalling a further expansion of an
already unpopular war.

It is two springs later, and times
change. The student deaths have
ceased. The Vietnam War contin-
ues. Many people have forgot--
ten, or choose to ignore. The
"Capitol Area Emergency Mora-
torium Committee" has done nci-
thcr.

The group, composed of repre-
scntatives from SUNYA as well as
a vast variety of peace groups
throughout the Capital District,
announced plans Tuesday after-
noon for “a silent, angry funeral
march" on the afternoon of May

4th. The march will co-incide with
other demonstrations and more-
toriums held across the country
that day, all aimed at the recent
escalation of the United States air
war or as commemorations of the
tragedies at Jackson and Kent
State Universities.

Here in Albany, the group plans
to assemble at the park across
from the intersection of State
Street and Broadway at 11:00
e.m. They will march silently up
State Street, pausing five times.
They will stop at the federal
building, leave a mock coffin, and
read a short indictment of what a
spokesman called “genocidal gov-
ernment policies."

They will visit the recruitment
office at '74 State Street and
follow the same procedure as "an
cndictmcnt of the armed forces."

They will stop at the Banker’s

Trust ofﬁce “leaving their re-
sponsibility for the deaths they
have caused at their door step."

They will continue on to St.
Peter’s Church, “indicting the
church for its moral bankruptcy
and its complicity with the war
machine."

Then the marchers will visit the
I.B.M. office at the top of State
Street, and ﬁnally, rally at the
steps of the Capitol, as has been
done many times before. “We
want to show our outrage at the
recent escalation of the air war,“ a
spokesman said, in explanation of
why such a march has been sche-
duled. "But the theme of thy rally
will be ‘Don‘t Mourn - Organize!‘
We’ll express out silent outrage in
the funeral march but we will also
show that we are not being pare-
lyzed. We will rcnew out commit
ment to change America."

Stony Brook: Police Pay Visit

by Maida Oringher

The crowds were a little smaller
than two years ago but the scen-
ario was much the same. Protest.
Confrontation. Rock-throwing.
Police.

Campus protests may have sub-

_ sided elsewhere in the country as
students gear toward a May 4th

moratorium, but at the State Uni-
versity at Stonybrook, demonstra-
tions have been occurring all

1 week, the faculty senate has sus-

pended classes end Suffolk Coun-
ty Police made a brief appearance
on campus to confront student
demonstrators.

Monday night, some 150 stu-
dents rallied in front of the Stony-
brook Computing Center, built a
ban ﬁre, and began tossing peb-
bles which soon turned to rocks,
at the windows. Campus security
police acted as human buffers and
then moved in to arrest one stu-
dent for tossing stones and bring-
ing wood to the bonfire.

The itrrcstcd student was
brought to a security car and
forty of the students converged
on the vehicle trying to force the
door open and free the captive. As
the car tried to break through the

crowd, students smashed the front
and rear windows; the security
officer suffering minor cuts on his
face.

An angry crowd of students,
chanting "Students Together“
headed for the dorms to round up
more student support. The crowd
grew to an estimated 500 and
moved toward the security build-
ing to demand release of the
arrested student. But the student
had already been brought to the
Suffolk County Community Sixth
Precinct where he was charged
with Class A and Class B misde-
meanota. He has since been re-
leased on $750 bail.

Night Sticks and Riot Gear

At this point, students returned
to the computing center and re-
sumed their earlier chanting and
rock-throwing. But this time, Suf‘
folk County Police had been
called to the scene. In twenty curs
anti numbering about fifty, the
men, equipped with night sticks
and riot gear, formed a human
line between the students and the
building. The crowd withdrew and
tear gas, which the police had
prepared for use, was never fired.

The students, now about 700
strong, retreated to a dormitory
and planned further strategy.

Earlier in the day, some 200
students rallied at the administra-
tion building and about 60 of
them went to the fourth ﬂoor and
rummaged through files searching
for information about research
activities conducted on the cam-
pus. But the files contained only
budget summaries and the stu-
dents vacated the building after a
higher ofﬁcial agreed to meet with
them and provide information
that they requested.

Reading Days to Action Days

Tuesday, students had another
rally at the administration build-
ing and then moved in, peacefully,
to a scheduled faculty senate
meeting. There, they demanded
that the faculty cithcr suspend
classes or decide not to impose
penalties on students who failed
to attend them. The faculty mem-
bers decided to Cilitcttl scheduled
rcuding days (which are ordinarily
held before finnls)suspcnd classes
this week, and make up the time
during the reading period.
