Dr. Pollock's tenure.

The method of admitting stu-
dents to Milne also has changed
during Foeseick’s period at Milne.
Selection presently is based solely
upon performance on a standard-
ized test as contrasted with pre-
vi us , " in which priority
was given to brothers and sisters
of students in school, the order of
submission of applications, and to
I children of Milne alumni or
: SUNYA faculty. The new proce-
I dure, described as totally object-
' ive, has becn designed to produce
I a student-body with a wide range
' of academic ability.

Fossieck‘s professional activities
shave been concentrated on the
' work of campus laboratory
.schools, particularly with the Na-
Itional Association of Laboratory
:Schools, and with the New York
IState Association of Secondary
'School Principals. He was chair-
:man of the High School-College
I Articulation Committee and chair-
man of District 16 of the princr-
Ipals‘ group. He has represented
' the association for 20 years on the
:Jenkins' Memorial Teacher Educa-
Ition Scholarship Committee of
' the New York State Congress of
. Parents and Teachers.

The Milne School will begin its
:127th year of operation in Sep-
Itember with increased emphasts
Ion research and pre-student-
:teaching laboratory experiences.
i'l‘he school will open without a
'7th grade for the ﬁrst time since
I 1929 as it. moves toward returning
' to a four-year- high school.

If you live on the SUNYA cam-
pus, you‘ve probably already en
countered two mysterious crea-
ures clad in yellow jackets bear-
mg long antennas that seem to
come from their bodies. Observers
have reported seeing such pairs
roaming through the dormitories
between the hours of 7 p.m. and 1
a.m. If you don't believe in sec-
ond-hand reports, sit in a dormi-
tory lounge and look for yourself.

No, they are not specimen
brought back from the moon;
they are the 35 SUNYA student
patrolmen - ready, willing, and
hopefully, able to help any stu-
dent in distress.

Bridge Between Students and Police

The leaders of this force are
three student coordinators, Bob
Gustavson, James Watson, and
Diane Kowalsky, chosen by Resi-
dence Director Chuck Fisher, Sc-
curitv Director Jim Williams. and

*SIINYA Student Patrol:
Ready, Willing, 8. Able to Help

SA President Michael Lampert.

The newly created patrol of 35
(nine are women) is a pilot pro-
gram created to build a bridge
between students and the SUNYA
Police and to bring to the Police
department an appreciation of
student values. “Gripe sessions”
between student patrolmen, coor-
dinators, and security Police, en-
able the group to share ideas and
suggest changes in the security
system.

On a more immediate level, the
force helps prevent crime on cam-
pus. Gustavson said that the stu-
dent patrol rclievcs the security
policemen to patrol areas of the
campus previously uncovered, and
since the program has begun, the
security office is receiving fewer
calls from students who need help
in the dormitories.

“Many students would rather
speak to a student patrolman,"
Gustavson said, "since they don't
have to worry about what they
are saying."

Williams, 60 crimes were reported
during March - a decrease of 52%
from March 1971. Although Gus-
tavson said that it is difficult to
explain the reason for the decline,
some believe that the student pa-
trol might haVe had an effect in
the great decrease.

Not "Eyes and Ears" of Security

Gustavson explained that the
yellow nylon jackets worn by the
student patrolmen serve as identi-
fication. “They are not spys,”
Gustavson said. “If the patrolman
are needed the students can spot
them easily."

“We are not the ‘cyes and cars'
of security," Gustavson empha-
sized," the patrolmen are students
and will related to others in that
role."

The 10 patrolmen on duty every
night - 2 for each quad - check
building doors, observe and report
victim crimes, act as witnesses in
court if need arises, advise victims
of alternatives (internal judicial
system, outside criminal courts,
charge in both, or do nothing),
refer someone needing a place to
sleep to 5300, get a student a ride
to the infirmary, and monitor
student-security encounters.
