WASHINGTON -AP- Sen.
Edmund Muskie, his once~bright
prospects battered by a series of
primary defeats, withdrew Thurs-
day from active campaigning in
Democratic primaries but said
he'll stay in the presidential race.
' Almost to a man, Muskie’s big-
name supporters said they will

stand by his candidacv. hoping he
might still emerge as a possible
compromise choice at the Demo-
cratic National Convention this
July in Miami Beach. Privately,
however, some conceded this was
unlikely.

Muskie told a jammed news con-

 "Protest Continues at Coliimbia

NEW YORK -AP- Two of five
occupied building at Columbia
University were reopened Thurs-
day es angry dispossessed students
wrested control of their class-
rooms away from antiwar
demonstrators.

The liberation of the 12-story

physics building, Pupin Hall, was
accomplished by a small group
who drove the demonstrators out
in a kicking, ﬂailing clash that left
several persons with minor in-
juries.

One of the score of graduate

students and faculty members
routed from Pupin, Rod Wallace,
30, declared:

“This was a planned vigilante
action. It is unfortunate that the

We are violating the law through
civil disobedience. We would not
have resisted arrest."

“I will not encourage violence
between students," Columbia Col-
lege Dean Carl Hovde announced
as he arrived at the scene.

However, shortly before the
storming of the hall, a leader of
the counterdemonstrators told
them: “The university did not
take any stand, they would just sit
back, they would not protect our
rights and if they wouldn't, we
will."

Earlier, the overnight occupancy
of the mathematics building by 30
antiwar demonstrators ended
when an equal number of students
who wanted classrooms reopened
climbed through a window and
forced out the protesters.

SAIGON AP - North Vietnamese
troops and tanks launched a major
attack today around Queng Tri,
the main city on the northern
front. Hours later a 0.8. officer in
the provincial capital said the
South Vietnamese were holding
their own.

As the nearest fighting exploded
three miles from the city, US.
Navy ships in the Gulf of Tonkiu
began shelling the North Vietnam-
ese positions and American planes
raided North Vietnam.

“This is certainly a major
attack," the U.S. officer told As-
sociated Press correspondent
Lynn C. Newland. “They threw a
lot of stuff in there this morning
and are going all out."

WASHINGTON -AP- President
Nixon plans to pull mother

July 1 ~ and to keep on bombing
North Vietnam until Hanoi half.
is "massive invasion” of the
South.

Announcing this in a 17-minute
radio-TV address Wednesday
night, Nixon appealed for nation-
wide support against what he
termed "this ﬁnal challenge" to
his program to get us. troops out
of South Vietnam without “sur-
rendering our friends to Com-
munist aggression.”

Nixon portrayed the current all-
out Communist offensive in the
South as a time of test in which
Saigon forces - if they continued
U.S. air and naval help - will foil a
desperate Hanoi gamble.

His new two-month withdrawal
schedule will cut remaining US.
forces in South Vietnam to
49,000, which he noted was less
than 10 per cent of the 549,000
authorized there when he took
office in January 1969.

The enemy's “one remaining
hope," Nixon said in words aimed
at stateside critics, “is to win in
the Congress of the United States,
and among the people of the
United States, the victory they
cannot win among the people of
South Vietnam or on the battle-
field in South Vietnam.

ALBANY, N.Y. -AP- The As-
sembly gave final legislative ap-
proval Thursday to a $1.15 billion
bond issue designed to meet New
York State's most pressing en-
vironmental needs.

The Senate had passed the bill
without dissent Wednesday and
unanimous Assembly approval
came in a brief iii-second man-
never.

If Gov. Nelson Rockefeller signs
it, as he has said he will, the
measure will be submitted to the
voters in November.

Most of the bond money - $650
million dollars - would go to pay
the state share of building new
sewage treatments plants across
the state. A companion bill detail-
ing the spending list 157 sewage
projects, and more could be added
if Congress passes pure waters
legislation that is not stalled in a
House-Senate conference com-
mittee.

ALBANY, N.Y. -AP- Despite
objections that it would jeo-
pardize the concept that a man is
innocent until proveii guilty, the
Assembly hiis iipproved legislation
to keep convicted dope pusliers in
jail for 60 days without bail if
they are arrested again.

Democratic Assemblyman Bur-
ton Hecht of the Bronx summed
up his support for the measure by
declaring, “You're not dealing
with an ordinary criminal here.
You're dealing with the scum of
the earth.”

The bill by Assemblyman Philip
Henley, R-Massapequa, would
prohibit the granting of bail to a
person charged with selling
heroin, opium or cocaine if he had
a prior conviction for the same
offense.

It was one of more than 160
bills approved by both houses,
most of them in the Assembly
which held an unusual BVi-Iiour
floor session.
