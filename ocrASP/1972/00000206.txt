Opening night, starring the rock
group, "Ice," drew about 600
students. Their regular Sunday
coffeehouaes opened with Chris
and Brian. The managers hope to
keep “Henway's” open more of-
ten, perhaps Thursday through
Sunday, according to Rich Jami-
son. The staff, howraver, is not
paid, and the job is time consum-
ing.

Other plans include moving the
sandwich bar and opening an art
gallery for student showings and
sales. Also, Glenn Valle is trying
to set up a movie theatre as part
of the enterprise. The group
would expand into the offices
adjacent to the L-Lounge, and the

Student Patrol

continued from page 3

The patrolman's job does not
include physical confrontations. if
a problem arises, the student will
contact a security policeman by
radio. However, Gustuvson added
that “a student patrolman should
be willing to intervene if someoiw
is being attacked and needs help
immediately."

Relate to Students

“We looked for someone who
didn't see the job us fill Adum- l2

registration cards that all students
ﬁll out. The new procedure in-
volves filling out a short form that

V- All issues of the ASP until

By using th'e'"form you can be
insured of a correct listing 'iii‘the
1972-73 University Directory.

This_will mike life a lot easier for
many students during the aca-
demic year. All students who will
be commuters next year are urged
to complete one of the forms as
soon as they are sure of their
address and telephone number for
the '72-’73 academic year.

Getting the directories to the
university community is most im-
portant and the lateness problems
of past years have been solved.
The basic solution to the problem
is that the directory is now being
printed in Colonic rather than in
Lubbock, Texas, thus saving many
wasted days of transportation
time.
