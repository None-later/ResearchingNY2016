Changing the Oppressor's Heart

 

The Passive Jew

by Shalom b‘olam

The Holocaust (murder of more
than six million Jews and four
million other peoples) is being
commemorated at the present
time. Ceremonies have been pian-
nod to honor the memories of all
those who were the Victims of the
Nazi horror. in the midst of these
plans. one can hear revived charges
that the .. Jéws went to their
deaths passively; rind further. that
Jews have always been passive.

To combat that image of pas-
sivity. books were written docu-
menting the resistance of Jews to
their oppressors. but few attempts
have been made to justify and
understand (in a modern light)
this so-called 'passive Jew.‘ And
today. we have defense groups
forming which see us one of their
main functions the dismissal of
passivity from the Jewish outlook.

l. for one. am opposed to this
villiﬁcation of Jewish passivity. on
the grounds that what has been
taken for a weakness is really the
greatest strength we Jews possess.
I would have to agree that docility
is wrong. but, again. I point out.

Jews have never been easily con-
trolled by any oppressor.

The Western political society in
which we live makes the grand
assumption that men must be
controlled. Political society is
established so as to control innate—
ly evil man and to force his
cooperation with his fellow man.
In a sense, than. the entire system
under which we live is concerned
with external controls on our be-
havior. and not upon the inner
depth of our helnpAs such, West~
ern political society is little con-
cerned with the hatred and frus-

PAGE 8 ‘

tration we harbor inside, so long
as those feeling can be success-
fully suppressed and not made
manifest in our dealings with out
fellow men, or those institutions
established to control us.

Active resistance of the sort
glorified by these growing defense
groups focuses itself on the in-
stitutions. Through violence and
violent tactics. an attempt is made
to force certain groups to change
their policies. And if those groups
refuse to change policy the ration-
ale is offered in terms of slogans:
Two of them for every one of us!

Therefore. by attacking the ex-
ternal controls which Western
society sees as the crux of the
problem (e.g. oppression). a gain
or victory is declared accomplish-
ed. But if you think about it.
nothing has been solved other
than the immediate situation - and
even that is doubtful. The resolutv
ion to the frustration and hatred
which create such phenomena as
the Holocaust and oppression of
minorities by majorities. needs an-
other means of resolution.

In seeking such a resolution.
Jewish tradition offers the teach-
ing that each man must be judged
by his merit, not his external
appearances. Merit is an internal
quality not observable by com-
puters or by a system. geared
towards classification of its
inhabitants. It can only be
discerned by learning to listen to a
person, and learning to appreciate
the preclousness of another
human being.

And such a course can be
followed only if one concentrates
upon internal change, rather than
external control. As such. Jews
have develoned a religious-ethical

system which fashions our ethical
thought of the day. You may
argue that such an emphasis in
Jewish life is the result of circum~
stances rather then desire. but it
matters little. for without such a
development. Jews would long
have disappeared. The Nazi men-
ace would have appeared in an-
other form to plague another
people.

if we are interested in changing
the way a man thinks rather than
the way he pretends to think (to
gain acceptance in society). a cer»
tain religious-ethical system must
be employed. Violence cannot ac~
complish anything more than
external submission. while inside
the bitterness ferments; and even-
tually it will explode into more
violence. In such a case. a vicious
circle is created: as is painfully
obvious in the state of world
affairs today!

The solution therefore lies in
accepting persecution rather than
being the pemcutor‘. accepting
oppression rather than being the
oppressor. But acceptance in a
particular way. Rather than sink
to the level of the persecutor. the
persecuted must strive to remain
pure in his beliefs. and convince
his oppressor that he is wrong.

My effort has not been to defend
the way in which my people
accepted thier situation during
World War II. but rather to offer
one suggestion as to possible
reasons. a brief essay can't hope
to take all factors into account,

only offer a brief outline. If you

wish to react, react through the
Jewish journal at SUNYA.
Zuchar. It is only through dia-
logue that conﬂict is resolved.

Continue 8-"

Through ’72-3

On Monday, the University Senate will
have before it a bill which would put all
undergraduates on a mandatory A-E grad—
ing system. The only exceptions to AE
gradint will be for courses designated by
departments as “S-U graded."

We find this plan totally unacceptable.
The Undergraduate Academic Council.
some of whose members are sponsoring
the new grading proposal, has failed
miserably in responding to student nch
and opinion in regard to grading. Faced
with some flaws in the present S-U system.
the UAC ovcrrezictcd to the point where
their final recommendation is indeed
reactionary. The council seems to have
taken the attitude. “well. we know the old
system works, so why not go back to that
one?”

Why not? He ausc the old system leaves
absolutely no options open to the student.
Because the old system has us striving for
a symbol instead of an education. Because
the old system has the same faults which it
had when we worked to change it in 196‘).

it is obvious to us now that the many
datory S-U system initiated in 1969 has
some weaknesses. Students wishing to
attend graduate schools feel that they may
have trouble gaining admission. But this is
no reason to scrap the system completely.
There is no assurance in the UAC plan that
departments actually will designate
enough courses S-U to meet the demands.
is the Senate going to ignore those stu
dents who are satisfied with S-U. who feel
it is meeting the goals of dc—cmphasizing
class competition. encouraging exploration
of new areas. and allowing more academic
freedom?

We hope not. The UAC proposal clearly
does not satisfy the needs of the majority
of students. Even those who desire grades
for themselves realize that there should be
a provision for students who want to
remain on S-U. Undoubtedly, there are
also incoming freshmen who choscAlbany
State because of its progressive system of
grading.

Instead of the UAC proposal. we support
the minority report of those faculty and
students on the UAC who are opposed to
the council‘s decisions. It calls for the
continuation of the present S—U system for
the academic year 1972-73. with the
opportunity afforded to students to
petition for A-E grades. lt recommends
that the Senate appoint an ad-hoc com
mittce on grading. independent of the
UAC. to continue sacking a solution to the
grading problem.

We urge the Senate to defeat the UAC
proposal.

Faculty Puzzled by Parking

To the Editor:

It appears that a number of
students are genuinely puzzled as
to why faculty and staff should
have special puking areas reserved
for them. I too have never heard
or read a real defense of the
policy. so it might be useful to
state a few reasons why I think it
is justiﬁable:

1) Because of the placing of the
lots. staff members must at best
walk as far every day as the
students do. who usually walk to
class not from the parking lots but
from the quads.

2) Because the students live on
campus unrestricted parking
would mean that all the near
spaces would be occupied by stu-
dent cars at the end of the day
when the rest of us vacate. Next
morning all thme choice spaces
would still be ﬁlled by the same
are. which would have been there
all night and might well not be
moved for days at a time. Thus
staff people would never have an
opportunity to use these spaces
no matter how early as far as the
students. Therefore apparent
equality would in reality be dis-
crimination.

These considerations apply
equally well to commuter stu-
dents. to be sure, and perhaps

they should have thesameprivilege
as faculty as staff. There is how-
ever. one difference between the
two groups, perhaps more philo-
sophical than practical:

3) Students are by nature tran-
sient. while the rest of us are
permanent—such at least is our
expectation. I have so far put up
with nearly nine years of gross
inconvenience at this university
(not just with parking!) and I may
have as much as 30 years of the
same to look forward to. I
honestly don't think that it is
unreasonable to ask that those of
us for whom this campus is likely
to be our more or less lifelong
center of activity be granted a
modest extra privilege to make
our daily routine here just a little
less inconvenient. The layout of
this campus is so unpactical that
in any event we are not greatly
aggravating the resident student's
inconvience. On balance the extra
convenience for us. minor though
it is. is greater: if the policy
should be changed the incon-
vience to us will ouweigh the
beneﬁts that the resident students
will gain.

In peace and good will.

SUNYA Pressured by HEW
into Illegal Action?

To the Editor:

Since you printed President Ben-
ezet's denial that our affirmative
action program requires quotes or
preferential treatment for minor-
ities and women, the evidence on
which thare charges were based
should also be of interest. In
January of this year, I sought the
advice of the Anti-Defamation
League as to whether the SUNYA
afﬁnnative action program was in
violation of state law. In my
correspondence with the ADL.
and in the ADL‘s letter to Presi-
dent Benezct, the following fea-
tures of the SUNYA program
were cited as objectionable and
illegal:

(i) a memorandum of September
28. 197l signed by President Ben-
ezet asked departments to “consi—
dcr anticipated vacancies through
terminations over the ﬁve year
period (of the program) and indi-
cate how many...could feasibly be
allocated to minority members."

(ii) the program itself says “the
University will defer the ﬁlling of
some positions until qualiﬁed mi-
nority members and women are
added to the staff of the Univer-
aity;"

(iii) former Vice President for
Student Affairs 'I‘hornc in a memo
of September 3 said... "temporary
preference in the hiring of new
personnel must be given to mem-
bers of minority groups...“ well
as to women." The memo con-
tinues: “As a guideline I would
urge that no fewer than one of
every three new and vacant posi-
tlons be need with minority mem-
bers. Additionally, one of every

APRIL 28. 1972

 

three positions should be filled by
a woman‘."

(iv) Vice President Sirotkin an-
nounced at the Educational Posi-
cies Council meeting of December
16 that 10 faculty positions for
1972-73 were “specifically ear-
marked for the appointment of
women and minorities;"

(v) Vice President Hartley was
quoted in the December 3rd ASP
as announcing a policy of “one-
to—one hiring of minorities affect-
ing all the administrative staff.
This means for every white (non-
minority member) hired. a minor-
ity member is hired."

Much more could be written on
this program and its implications.
To cite just one point: faculty
control over hiring is considerably
reduced by the mode of operation
of our Afﬁrmative Action Pro-
gram.

[t is not clear to me that this
program would have been created
by the SUNYA administration in
the absence of pressure from the
federal Department of Health,
Education. and Welfare. 1 sympa-
thize with the university's posi-
tion in being caught between
HEW, which can terminate all
federal contracts and has done so
elsewhere, and the ADL. whose
intervention has certainly brought
unwelcome publicity. But I feel
too strongly that quotas and dis-
crimination are wrong to allow all
the pressure on SUNYA to be
from one side.

Sincerely yours.

' FOR WHAT?! ,

To the Editor:

Driving a car with no brake is
no joke. In fact it's pretty scary
especially when you expect them
to work and they don't. Halon to
this story.

i brought my car to Vrbsnsc’s
Esso gas station on Western Ave..
(the Esso station next to Cosi-
moe). on Monday nite because I
thought I needed new brake lin-
ings. Before I brought my car
there. the brakes were working
perfectly. except for some squeak-
ing. which indicated that I pro-
bably needed new lining on one
o’r more wheels.

It was late so I left my car there
overnight and the owner told me
to call him Tuesday morning be-
tween 9 and 9:30 a.m. for an
estimate. The next morning I
called Vrbanac's Essa at 9:15 and
the owner told me that his mech-
anic had taken off all 4 wheels
and that I needed a new brake
drum and lining on the front ridit
and new lining on the front left.
The price: $65. I told him I was
sorry but I could not affort 865
and would pick up my car in a
half hour. The owner then told
me that the mechanic had done
no work on my car except check
the brakes and appraise the job
and for that labor there would be
a slight service charge.

I arrived at Vrbanac's Esso 30
minutes later to speak to the
owner in person. Unfortunately
he wasn't there. I couldn't under—
stand, I had just spoken to him a
half hour ago. Any way the mech-
anic would not let me take my car
unless I paid $10.17.

I said FOR WHAT?! Who ever
heard of paying 10 bucks for a
brake estimate? Then the me
chsnic said he was sorry, but
that's what the boss said. I didn't
want to wait around all day so I
paid the money and left.

Now. here's the killer. I drove
out of the station and proceeded
downtown on Western when I
realized I couldn't stop. my
brakes barely worked. Granted. I
don't know too much about brake
mechanics, but I most surely
know how to use them and this
time they didn‘t work. Well, to
make a long story short I brought
my ear to a brake specialist on
Central. I asked if there would be
a charge for an estimate. The clerk
said, of course not - just call us in
a few hours for an estimate. Well.
to my surprise I didn't need a new
brake drum, just new linings. The
entire cost. $40. That's $26 less
that Vrbanac Esso.

Being that this station is so close
to the university. I felt it was my

responsibility to communicate
that incident. This is an important
service provided by the ASP. I
hope students and faculty will use
it more, AND PLEASE, THINK
TWICE BEFORE DOING BUSI‘
NESS WITH VRBANAC'S ESSO
ON WESTERN AVE.

Administration “Finds No Funds"
for Chinese

To the Editor:

If our university's administra-
tion would care to check the
records of enrollment in our Chi-
nese language courses since their
inception. they would find a dra-
matic increase year by year. If
they would deign to notice the
world outside our university, they
might realize the increasing impor-
tance of China in the world today.

As a student presently taking
Chinese, I have learned that a
teacher win to be hired to teach
Chinese full time (including the
third year) for next year. This
past week the university decided
it had no funds available. At
present two years of Chinese are
being offered - the third being
disgracefully cut off in the middle
of this semester. The fact that the
Chinese langauge is so alien to
English. and that is is necessary to

learn characters, makes only two
years of Chinese ridiculous. It is
necessary to have a full three
years of Chinese for any sort of a
ﬁrm base.

In this university there seems to
be room for Black, Puerto Rican,
Judaic. and Italian studies. One
quarter of this world speaks Chi-
nese - is it any less important than
the above? The only reason I can
fathom why "no funds can be
found" for Chinese is that the
administration assumes that those
who are interested. unlike in the
other cases, will make no protest.
ls such protest needed to gain
what should be granted by com-
mon sense? If so, I humbly submit
that there are some here who
would be willing to do so.

Sincerely.

Drugs - Doctor’s Little Helper

To the Editor:

In recent years. the medical [Io
fession has lost a great deal of
respect with the American public.
The primary reason for this loss is
because many doctors are grossly
ignorant of the nutritional causes
of disease and attempt to compen-
sate for their ignorance by pre-
scribing dangerous drup. Uninten-
tionslly, physicians have become
less the healers of people than
salesmen for the pharmaceutical
ﬁrms and they (not students) are
the greatest drug abusers in the
world.

Because of the paucity of health
training in their educations. and
because of the powerful inﬂuence
of the American Medical Associa-
tion. doctors have ignpred various
common, inexpensive methods to
prevent and cure cancer. prefering
the more expensive « but ineffec-
tive - means sanctioned by the

AMA. This is one of the reasons
why a growing segment of our
populations believes that some
doctors will be responsible for
more deaths than liVes saved
during this decade.

The solution to America's
problem of poor health is greater
than shattering the myth of the
omniscent doctor; we must con-
currently work towards the
creation of a ﬁeld of “natural
doctors" cognizant of the fact
that good nutrition is as impor-
tant to prevention and cure of
disease as is the use of drugs.
People interested in working on
this problem - or who know of
any similar projects already
started in this area - please call or
