 by T. H. Littleliold

There's a- bill to revise the grad-
ing system on the agenda of the
University Senate that would turn
the clock back, if it were adopted,
three years ago. It advocates a
return to the old, mandatory A-E
grading method, a method that
was abandoned, for freshmen and

sophomores, in 1969. Just when.

we were beginning to think, some
of us, that this University might
have some chance of moving
somewhere ahead.

Two of the reasons urged by
those who favor going back to
mandatory A-E grading seem to
have some substance to them. The
ﬁrst is that when you’re trying to
learn something it helps to be told
whether or not you 're on the right
track. The more precisely you're
told, the better you‘re able to stay
on the track and keep moving.
The other reason is that, right or
wrong, .most admissions officers

and personnel officers still prefer
to include A-E grades among their
criteria of selection, and some
even demand A-E grades, at least
in the courses they consider most
signiﬁcant.

The trouble with the ﬁrst reason
is that in spite of our having fallen
into the habit of relying on A-E
grading as a yardstick for measur-
ing academic achievement, it isn’t
a very precise instrument. Often it
produces the illusion of informa-
tion about achievement while ob-
scuring the realities. A student has
to be sophisticated in interpreting
grades and clear in his mind as to
the evidence on which his "B" is
based and the relation of such
evidence to the substance of the
subject if he's to know what the
“B” really means. The same goes
for an admissions ofﬁcer.

There’s nothing wrong with the
other reason as an argument for
optional A-E or S-U grading, but

it fails to support a mandatory
A-E system because (1) some un-
dergraduates couldn't care less
about what graduate school ad-
missions officers thing; (2) few
admissions officers insist on A-E
grades, while some actually prefe‘
S-U grades because” they believe a
better kind of learning is likely to
take place in S-U courses; and (3)
hardly any admissions officers are
interested in having A-E grades in
courses that don’t relate to the
graduate specialty.

S-U grading isn't the final solu-
tion to the problems of student
evaluation, nor [is it sufﬁcient
without the use of supplementary
instruments, but is has certain
advantages. Nobody is misled by
an "S," as he might be by an “A,”
"B," or "C," into thinking he has
an exact index of the student‘s
achievement when he hasn‘t. Out-
psyching the professor plays a less
crucial role in an S-U course;
consequently, pursuing the in-
trinsic excitements of the subject
matter can play a larger role.
Students are freer to throw them-

selves into the parts of their curri-
cula that really turn them on
intellectually, concentrating their
energies where their strengths and
excitements lie withOut having to
miss out altogether on the values
of courses in more peripheral sub-
jccts.

When all the students in a course
are graded S-U there are extra
dividends. When the professor
doesn't have to organize his
course around the process of sort-
ing his students into ticky-tacky
boxes with alphabetical labels he
can concentrate on the potentiali-
ties of all of his students, rather
than upon their limitations. Apart
from independent study and com-
munity service courses, which are
in a different category, there are
at present a few dozen courses in
the whole undergraduate Univer-
sity that are approved to be grad-
ed S-U. There is no proposal for
increasing the number of such
courses now before Senate or any
of its councils and committees,
though there is a certain amount

of lip service to the desireabillty
of doing so.

Some scheme by which a stu-
dent can have the option as to
whether in a particular course or a
particular semester he is to be
graded A‘E or S-U would achieve
most of the advantages of EU
grading while giving any student
who wants it a chance to build up
a record of A's and 3's with which
to wow the admissions ofﬁcer at
the graduate shcool of his choice
or the personnel officer scrutini-
zing his job application. But that
is ruled out by the bill now before
Senate.

There is one provision in that
bill as it is written that may
appeal to some students. The bill
is so drawn as to provide that no
undergraduate student can ever be
flunked out of the university for
deficient grades. Probablyﬁhoudi,
that represents not the quality of
mercy so much as the quality of
thought that has gone into the
bill‘s drafting. Anyway, it‘s good
for a laugh, and that's something.

The New York June 20th pri-
mary is now less than two
months away, and while much
interest and activity is being fo-
cused on and generated toward
the presidential primary, an inter-
esting congressional primary has
developed in New York City.

The race is in the newly drawn
20th congressional district, run-
ning from W. 26th Street. The
primary is between two incum-
bents: William Ryan and Bella
Abzug. Representative Ryan has
been in the Congress since 1960
and is being supported by many
of the West Side office-holders
such as Jerome Kretchmer (EPA
Administrator), Al Blumenthal
(Deputy Minority Minority Lead-
er of the Ascmbly) and Council-
man Theodore Weiss. By contrast,
Representative Abzug is counting
on a strong turnout from women,
pence groups and minorities, for
whom she has considered herself a
special representative.

Those! who would be interested
in working on this effort can get
in touch with Steve Baker, who
will be working in Washington for
Representative Abzug this sum-
mer. He is presently in his first
year at Albany Law School and
may be contacted at 488 Madison
Avenue, or, by calling 434-4893
or 463-3395 (sooni).
