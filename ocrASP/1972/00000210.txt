and searchers In believing
that he might be alive and witil some-
on

W are unable to assess our son's
mental state alter several nights Iil the
woods but speculate that he may have
amnesia or might have made some kind
at “personality adlustmunt" to the life
style 01 tile person or group he is with.
Only this would explain why he has
not contacted us.

An individual picking him up might
have later panicku upon iinding out
that he was the object oi a search by
the police anti thousands oi people; or
he may have considered our sort. be-
cause of his mental state, a genuine
runaway irrim “cruel parents" and In
mood at assistance. Since the return oi
our son Is inromost til our minds, we
would hope that anyone who rntgllt
ave ANV rnlurrnatron concerning his

not hesitate to help since prosecution Is
certainly not our Intollt. Even the
