Trying to write an article about
the Star Spangled Wuhboard
Band is like studying fruit flies
without a microscope...whatever
that means. The colorful, versatile
Washboard Band, who will be
appearing this Saturday night with
Dave Bromberg and the Bottle
Hill Boys, defy all literary descrip-
tion. How can one possibly de.
scribe there on-stage antics as they
run the musical gamut from blue-
grass to opera? How can one begin
to list their wide array of instru-
ments that include jugs, spoons,
plungers, a typewriter, and the
one and only BathHouse Brass?
Why, to merely copy here the
lyrics to “Wish I Could Shimmy
Like My Sister Kate." or "She

Must be Jelly ‘Cauu Jerri Don'tzli'.”
Shake lee That," wouldn't give

you one iota of what they are all
about. But I'll try.

The group consists of Don
“Down-Home” Dworkin on'the
washtub bass and jam (the only
man who can handle two jugs at
once!), Greg “Wild Bill' Haymes
who plays washboard, whistles,
tamborines, spoons, brushes, ka-
zoos, nose flute, cymbals, mega-
phone. and would appear to be
the garbageman‘s best friend, Paul
“Jazzbo” Jossman on five-string
banjo and guitar (who is also the
sell proclaimed intellectual of the
group.), and Bill “Cousin Bill"
Polchinski who does to a guitar
what Mrs. O’Leary’s cow did to
