Senator Urges Scholar Incentive   

by Vicki Zaldln
Capitol Correspondent

Imagine that you are a student
whose parents earn a lot of
money, and you want to apply for
Scholar Incentive aid. Forget It
right? Wrong. Senator Ronald
Stafford (R: Clinton County),
head of the Senate Committee on
Higher Education, is currently
working on a proposal that would
allow a student to apply for
ucholar incentive aid using only
his income as the basis for the
award.

Currently, 21 student must in-
clude his parent‘s, as well as his
own income, when applying for

scholar incentive awards. Because
of this, students whose families’
not taxable incomes exceeded
$20,000 are not eligible for scholo
ar incantch awards. The Stafford
proposal would seek to change
this so “if it can be determined
responsibly...” that a student ic
footing his educational costs
strictly on his own he would only
have to declare his income when
applying for incentive payments.

The idea is that if a student
leaves home—in the financial
senstr-for any reasons, he would
still be able to afford the costs of
a higher education. Under current
provisions, in student must include

hil entire family‘s income when
applying for aid unions 1) he has
been living at an address different
than his college addr for at
least one year prior to his aid
application; 2) he has reached his
213i. birthday one year prior to
applying for aid; 3) he has been
married for a year prior to his aid
application; or 4) he has declared
himself financially emancipated
from his parents—which means
that he is no longer a tax exemp-
tion, and that he receives
nothing—no moneyI food,
clothing, etc.—from home—one
year prior to his aid application.

The Stafford plan would erase

would necessitate that a Itud'ent‘

no longer be included as an in-
come tax exemption by his par-
ents. If the measure is enacted
into law, it could open the door
for many students who are cur-
rently not eligible for any scholar
incentive aid to receive the maxi-
mum award, and increase awards
for many other students.

With the legislative session
racing towards its close, and with
the Stafford plan still not drawn
into bill form, it does not seem
that students from wealthy, or
even moderately comfortable,
homes will be able to file for the
maximum incentive uword next
year. Even if the bill appears on
the Senate floor, it is more than
likely that vote‘ and dollar con-
scious lawmakers will want to
know the legislation's price tag for
the state. Stafford claimed that
the cost to the state would be
“not much at all,” but was unable
to produce any dollar estimates.

' {Quantum-cw Actions f ,

Tuesday, - the Assembly ap-
proved c bill cppniorcd by Senate
Mqlority Lender Earl Brydgel
(R-Nizrgrn Fall!) that would allow
students whose farniliea’ net, tua- '
ble incomes are in excess of
$15,000 to obtain loans from the
Higher Education Assistance Cor-
poration (HEAC) and the State of
New York Mortgage Agency
(SNYMA) at 7% interest. Current-
ly students from these families
must obtain a bank loan at 15%
interest.

Under the provisions of the plan
often referred to as “deferred
tuition," which passed the Senate
earlier, a student would not have
to start repaying the loan until
one year after he has left school
or three months after he becomes
regularly employed, whichever
comes first. Students whose fam-
ily incomes are above $15,000
would only have to pay the in-

In an attempt to look before he spends, the new president of the University Commuters club, Mike Ellis, had decided in favor of
relinquishing his budget request for next year except for $50, until a survey is taken to decide what should be done to fund activities for
all commuting students. An initial survey of two Student Association funded activities indicated out of approximately 130 persons polled
only 4 were commuters or off-campus residents. Further polling will be continued to see if commuters attend or support the activites they
fiscally support. A survey to attempt a better understanding of how commuters feel about Student Association funding of various

organization and their respective activities is being conducted in todays ALBANY STUDENT PRESS. If you live at home, or with a

 

guardian, or with friends off state property, it would be appreciated if you would please help by filling out this questionnaire, as
organizations may be asked to turn their programs of activities toward the commuter and what he or she is interested in, be it quidter
cafeteria or paved walkways from the parking lots. This is also an open invitation to all university personal and on-campus residents to
express themselves on activities that occur on our campus, if you are dissatisfied with what is happening now. Place completed

questionnaires in the box marked U.C.O. in the Campus Center by the information Desk. Your help would be appreciated.
