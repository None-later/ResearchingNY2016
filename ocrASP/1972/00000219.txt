holding two hunran beings heads with I smile. We arefully ewere oi Vlet

7 Nam problem without presenting e picture such as this. Instead of fighting
apinst the war you are submitting yourselves to go along with Nixon's
BULLSIIIT. 11» whole centpus are hypocrites or the University itself we
in flitting against the war. This is not I yearbook, it is I book which
represents the true inner sell of the "so-called war haters."

I don't like the pictures of the "head" included with the senior pictures. i
truly do understand what you're trying to say with this book. And. I am

THE BOOK was (GREAT; GOOD. NICE,O;K.,SHI'I'........)

 

The picture inserted In the senior section sucksl Vou made your point
when you (on three or four other papsl-dtowed It in lull form - then pin
pointed it more ehd more. Including it on every page there
much. Being in that- row of seniors would have insulted me and pissed me
off. The cover was nice only sense dumby got Spring Weekend chocolate
on it. Any suggestions on how it can be domed? More colored shots
would have been appreciated. The mots submitted by students were I

interesting. funny at times end very enlightening. The two color shots of

not proud It all of the problems of this world. However, my college years

have been I tints of happiness too. (A little more is needed to raise people
up, don't you agree? Books such as this should ENCOURAGE because
they will last I long time and be passed down to future generations! Give
people something of VALUEI) It comes to my mind while looking
throudl this book that God through Jesus Christ is our only help if life,
and that through him everything can and does go wellll Believe me! I hope
you know this. If not, try it! I object to words used in this book such as
the above, which I have crossed out. They help NOone arid are wrong. This

two GAY brothers shocked my PARENTS III to hell. GOOD TRY - some
bummers. Especially, as I said, the senior section sucks!

 

work shows much conscious and serious effortll As far as that goes, WELL

DONE. I am completely serious about this. Thank you for asking my

opinion.

Just a note to say the yearbook is phenomenally territlic... communica-
tive, abusive, moving, shocking, in poor taste, and just beautiful.

Remember- Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors

Absolute unadulterated shit. Cliches and “awareness.” We are all aware of
the Viet Nam tragedy. Repetition can be eflective if it’ s not overdone, but
3 heads/page between Senior pictures is absurd and pointless. Yes, you
communicated - how ridiculous and useless a yearbook can be. How about
some active protest instead of "shocking" pictures to make an impact.
You missed the mark, you hypocritical capitalist asses.

 

Why did your research staff check into who really is the President of the
Pie-Med Pro-Dent Society. The person you have down is not even in the

 

organization. I, (the Pros.) had to get his resignation as Treasurer because

like you he was ‘doing a poor job. I hope to see another of your lull page
ads in the ASP apologizing publicly for mistakes such as this! How could

you do this to me. I thought up the idea and did all the work to create this
society. I hope my name appears in the next year's book as its Pres.
