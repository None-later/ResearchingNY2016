. byBlIl Brine
You win a few; you lose a few.
'Poco, due at the Gym Friday,
cancelled out when Richie Furay
came down with food poisoning.
The show will be rescheduled for
the fall, or so the Concert Board
claims. Bottle Hill & David
Bromberg & his Fabulous Tor-
pedoes (bassist Steve Berg & man-
dolin/sax player Andy Stattman)
came Saturday as scheduled, and
quickly decided that it would be
too cold outdoors (where the con-
cert was scheduled), so the show
was presented in the CC Ballroom,
which was stuffed way in excess
of whatever its legal capacity is
supposed to be. One can't help
but wonder; it was as warm out-
doors as it might reasonably be
expected to be at this time of the
year. If that wasn't warm
enough, why was a concert
scheduled outdoors in the first
place'.’ I asked, and was told “It
might have been eighty.“ Sure.
Fortunately, the fire marshall
wasn't around, and the quality of
the music made up for the hassles.
Bottle Hill had played their asses
off nearly all night the night

before at the Bethlehem Coffee-

house. so they weren’t as tight as ‘

they'd been in February, but
they’re still good; bouncy, in-
fectious goodnime freak-bluegrass
music. Their friend the
harp-player came on for a few
moments and was really fine;
some more experience & a
broader repetoire & he should
vault on to stardom.

And then, David. The opener
was a bit rough-Dave‘s got what
amounts to an anti-prescenee on-
stage (he rushes into a number. in
a somewhat graceless manner) and
his sound man was having 49
kinds of trouble with the SUNYA
sound system-whenever he turned
up the acoustic guitar mike he was
getting overloads and harsh,
cracking sounds from the
speakers. After a few minutes the
sound got straightened out and
Dave started to establish a real
rapport with the audience. and all
was well.

The man's a flawless guitarist
and a truly weird singer. His voice
cracks, hlcats, and in general be-
haves like a faulty sound system,
but it does communicate. After a

while, you take it to heart. The
Torpedoes are good-bassist Steve
Berg's sound is fairly heavy for
this kind of music but he makes it
work, and Stattman‘s mandolin
playing was sweet. Somehow,
Bromberg puts these disparate
elements together and makes
them work. His first LP, Columbia
(‘3l 104. llllctl simply “Dave
Bromherg" will do if you haven't

seen him; it’s good but somehow
it just doesn't communicate the
way that David the artist does in
concert. When he departed, the
hall was filled with overwhelming
applause (not an everyday occur-
rence here). Dave came back to do
"Sammy‘s Song“ from his LP,
told us “There’s so mtteh to
say--but I can't say it“ and dc-
parted.

 SIRINDBERG

‘ ’ Theatre council's last guest

artist presentation of the year will
be PLAY STRINDBERG, pre-
sented by the Repertory Theatre
of Lincoln Center on the PAC
Main Stage at 8:30 PM., Friday,

STRINDBERG, an American pre-
miere by Friedrich Duerrenmatt,
promises to be an even more
enjoyable and stimulating evening
of theatre. The play is loosely
based on August Strindbert's
“The Dance of Death," and turns
this sombre tragedy into a riotous
farce in the depiction of marriage
as a boxing match. PLAY

New York east-~all of whom will
be performing at SUNY-~won
unanimous raves from all the
criticsuyes. inclduing Clive Barrios.

“Troillua and Creuldl," the
third and ﬁnal major production

Everything, I mean absolutely
everything, pointed to that pro-
duction being the one this season.
An aheolutely flawless set, apt
props, an efﬁcient lighting and
running crew, gorgeous costumer,
a sensitive and intelligent director
in Bob Sugarman, a cast with
energy enough to make up for
what it lacked in stage experience;
it was all there. So what possibly
could have conspired against
William Shakespeare’s interpreta-
tion of the kind of men who were
the legendary 'leaders of the
Grecian and Trojan legions?

script the ﬁrst time you look at it.
The process of devaloping a
character is often long and trying,
but in an undoubtedly essential
aspect of any more than
light-hearted attempt at
Shakespeare. One does not
develop character, necessarily,
from hiccoughing, spitting,
picking one's nose, etc. The
feeling must. be at hand first, then
whatever gestures grow naturally
out of that feeling will look
timely on stage.

Even the most avid of
Shakespeare fans will grant you
that this is not. his finest play. But
it is still rich in the insights that
distinguish Shakespeare from
more mortal playwrights. No, the
fault, dear friends, it not in our
scripts hut in ourselves that we are
underlings.

The good moments were quite
good. Bill Doseher provided us
with it splendid Thcmitcs. Here is
n case of flying with the nuances
of Shakespeare instead of being
continually enrthbound. I'Ve not
