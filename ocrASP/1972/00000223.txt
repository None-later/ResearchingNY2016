Antiwar protests have erupted
across the country in the wake of
President Nixon's announcement
Monday night that he had escala-
ted the war by mining Haiphong
harbor. The demonstrations,
arrests, and shootings brought to
mind the campus turbulence of
two years ago, when “ “‘ " of
college campuses were closed
down and four students were shot
to death at Kent State University.

The Student Mobilization Com-
mittee reported last night that a
national student strike has been
set for Friday and national de-
monstrations have been called for
Saturday in cities across the coun-
try.

Students Shot

National attention was focused
on the University of New Mexico
in Albuquerque where two stu-
dents were shot by police Tues-
day evening. Mrs. Carolyn Babb
Cohen, a reporter for the campus
newspaper, remained in serious
condition late last night at a
downtown hospital. She was hit
with buckshot in the stomach and
back. The second student, Paul
Smith, was treatedand released.

Police had at ﬁrst denied any
