ALBANY, N.Y. - Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller said President Nixon
deserves the "support of the
American people” for his an.
nouncement of stepped-up mili-
tary action against North Viet-
nam. 

Rockefeller said in a statement
issued by his ofﬁce, “The Presi-
dentI faced with a deeply difﬁcult
situation. expressed himself forth-
rightly in his statement tonight in
setting forth a course of action

_ which he feels will reflect the best

interests of our country, and of
world peace. He deserVes the sup-
port of the American people."

New U.S. moves to cut off
North Vietnam’s weapons supply
were “inevitable and correct,"
U.S. Sen. James L. Buckley said
Monday night.

After watching President Nix-
on's Vietnam address on television
in a Rochester hotel, Buckley told
newsmen, “I fully support the
president’s decisions."

He described the military ac-
tions announced by the president
“consistent with the Nixon doc-
trine of withdrawing ourselves
from land involvement" in Viet-
nam.

The Conservative Republican
lawmaker said he believed Nixon
would receive strong support from
the American people.

"He got their backing when he
went into Cambodia," Buckley
said. and predicted the public
would recognize the blockade as a
“sensible decision."

Buckley said a ﬁnal assessment
of the current Communist offen-
sive would have to wait “until
more time has gone by."

But, he added, “the military
context required decisive mea-
sures to choke off the flow of
heavy equipment" into North
Vietnam.

Asked Whether he though Com- 3
munlst China might be prompted
to step up its weapon supply 
activities, Buckley said this was a .
possibility. . ‘

On the other hand, he said, sue
a move would place a heavy bur-
den on the Chinese economy.

The senator was in Rochester to
address a conference of theStats
Manpower Planning Council.

Sen. Jacob K. Javits. R—N.Y.,
said today he had urged President
Nixon to allow Congress to join
with him in making a final deci-
sion on Nixon's latest Vietnam
policy.

If Nixon comes to Congress,
Javits said, “we will thereupon
have iopportunity' to determine
what is necessary to protect our
troops and what part our efforts
in a military sense are being uti-
lized to continue the South Viet-
namese government."

“We may decide inCongress that
we want to do both," Javits said.
“But it is time that we decided
with the President and the Presi-
dent not decide alone."

Javits told a news conference
“that fact is that we have not
gotten ourselves out of the Viet-
nam mire soon enough."

Javits said that he felt that, if
Nixon did not confer with Con-
gress, it might be necessary for
Congress to cut off military ap-
propriation aid “in order to have a
say in what is a very, very grace
decision for our country."

He said, too, he believed that,
since the US. had equipped and
armed the Smith Vietnamese, “it's
time they stood on their own
feet."

"They are at least .is well equip-
pcd as the North Vietnamese and
therefore the question is ‘Do they
want a country?‘."

 

 

 

l)(‘llll1(l the Campus Center at 9:00
pm, Wednesday night to protest
Nixon's escalation of the war.
After a short time, the crowd
iiiovvd toward the lake, swelling
rapidly to about «I00 persons. A
large bonﬁre was lit during a
gathering in the dirt parking lot
behind Indian Quad, and enthu-
siastic marchers shouted their de-
mands for action.

A target was chosen quickly and
about 300 marchers headed down

the crowd reached Western Ave-
nuc, about 25 demonstrators
broke off without waiting for the
remaining marchers to gather, and
hurled stones at “The Bank,"
breaking four or five windows.
The rock throwers retreated and
the entire group doubled back to
the Campus Center,

There the crowd was urged to
meet at RPI Thursday noon for
further action, possibly to block a
major road, according to one
speaker. Perhaps 20 persons con-
tinucd to urge further action im-
mediately, but one speaker asked
the crowd to disperse and go
home.

People drifted off, but about 50
persons chose the administration
building as another target, break~
ing two or three windows and
splashing red paint on the stone
white surfaces.

It was an efﬁcient operation run
by a veiy loosely organized leader-
ship. The rock throwing lasted byt
a minute while the march ran for
an hour. An activi. t element, ma-
ny of whom spotted Vietcong
flags, provldadthe energy for the
demonstration.

A PRIIIESIMS

Late last night the ASP received
the following message and was
asked to print itzTonight, Wednes~
day, I‘Iic [inn/c. (National Com-
mercial Bank and Trust) represen-
ting all lianks as the mainstay of
the monopoly-capitalist class in
this country, was dealt with by
the people of Albany State and
the Albany community The ac-
tion was it trashing as a symbolic
attack on the business institutions
which rule this country and con-
tinue to oppress the people of the
world and the people of the Uni-
ted Statcs. The object. was not
iiecissarily to end the operation of
that bank or any at this time but
to express the militancy and anger
of the people. Our goal was ac-
complished, the bank was hit and
all of the people moved safely to
and from the target. We neither
promoted nor supported, though,
the actions after the attack on the
bank. The tactical leadership
claims responsibility for The Bank
action only!

There are three points to be
clariﬁed to the people involved.
First, at the mass meeting It was
decided on the need for tactical
leadership. This need is twofold:
There is the need for disciplined
action, many leaders is no leader
and only anarchy and disorder can
follow. Also the safety of the
people present, all of the people,
must be considered and until the
guns of the government can be
met by the guns of the people,

many of our actions must be
symbolic and not be looking for
confrontation and martyrs (only
ﬁght battles that one can win).
Second, the leadership speciﬁcally
decided on having the action at

night instead of later to allow for
the safety and increased militancy
ol' the people present. Third, the
target chosen was symbolic- one
bank oppresscs as much as thi-
next: The monopon capitalist class
does not divide into two, the goon
hanks versus the had: a bank is a
bank.

In general, the leadership wants
to stress that the trashing of a
bank is no the revolution, ’l‘lu-
most important aspect of ljlliltling
a movement is day to din political
work to develop the intitiative of
a large majorin ol' the people in
this country. Windows can hr-
repliiced, buildings can be rebuilt,
but when thtl masses of people in
this country become active,
aware and revolutionary,
the ruling class will not be able to
remain in power. As time goes on,
the actions will escalate and the
numbers of people will grow. All
revolutionary people must com-
bine their actions with day to day
work, their revolutionary p r n c -

t i c c with revolutionary tlico-
ry and must go among the people
of America to constantly organize
and agitate. We must continue to
build for the ultimate victory of
the people. We have only begun to
fight!

The Tactical Leadership

 

THE ASP STAFF WOULD
LIKE TO EXPRESS ITS
GRATITUDE TO OSCAR,
THE Al’ MACHINE, FOR
ITS DUTIFUL SERVICE
IN HARD TIMES.
