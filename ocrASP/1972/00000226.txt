classic example oi. an understatement! It scents that every
time you turn around, someone is asking for money; and if
they are not asking, it's because they’re too busy

In addition to all the Free events being sponsored by

Sunday night and Wednesday night film series; the ice

A voluntary activities fee works two ways. First, it gives
us the money to pay for the events; and secondly, it saves
you money. You pug! $3.00 once, and you are entitled to

during the six week session. In fact. if you attend every
weekly event in one week, you have already saved money
