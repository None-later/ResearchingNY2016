by Marcus Eliason
Associated Press Writer

JERUSALEM, AP —. The
bodies of 10 Israeli Olympic
sportsmen murdered in Munich
came home Thursday for burial,
yet another grim harvest of the
Arab-Jewish war.

“Jews, demonstrate. Do some-

thing, or they'll kill us all, one
by one,“ cried the brother of
slain weightlifter Yosef
Romano clutching at the dead
man’s cofﬁn.
'2 “Vengeance,” screamed a poster
clutched by an Israeli schoolboy
at Lod airport. where the bodies
were brought in an Israeli air-
liner along with the sportsmen
who survived the Palestinian
kidnap attack at the Munich
Olympics.

Hundreds of relatives clustered
around the cofﬁns, which were
mounted on army wagons. The
relatives wept, screamed, shook
their ﬁsts, fainted. The 10
caskets were taken from the El
Al jetliner and placed on If)
brown army command cars.

The coffins vanished under
heaps of ﬂowers and wreaths.

The command cars, headlights
on, rumbled slowly across the
tarmac to a quadrangle of police
barriers. Waiting inside were

President Zalman Shazar,

Prime Minister Golda Meir,
who was to have attended, was
absent. Her_sister died earlier in
the day.

The cer'emony took place in
83-degree heat at the same spot
where the bodies of 16 Puerto
Ricans were loaded into a plane
three months ago. They were the
victims of another terrorist
attack, that time at Lod Airport
itself.

"God full of mercy, who
dwells upon high, find a good
resting place for ...“ chanted a
military cantor, then reciting the
names of the It) dead men.

An [I’Lh David Berger of
Cleveland,‘t‘)hio, was flown to
the United States for burial. He
had immigrated here 18 months
ago and was a weightlifter.

Allon, taking Mrs. Mcir's place
at the memorial ceremony,
repeated Israel‘s Vt‘llt'tl warning
that neighboring Arab states
“who assist the terrorists ..will be
held responsible."

After the ceremony, the
command cars drovc slowly
away from the airport, followed
by hundreds of cars, and headed
to six different cemeteries
throughout the country.

The nation is in the second day
of a weeklong national mourning
period.

 

tehcnese Skirmish

TEL AVIV, AP —- Israeli
troops entered Lebanon Thurs-
day in search of marauders after
clashes in which two Arabs and
an Israeli were killed.

A military spokesman said all
troops returned safely about
eight hours later. He did not say
whether there had been any
ﬁghting in Lebanon.

The Palestinian news agency
Wafa reported in Beirut that
Israel was massing troops and
tanks along the borders of
Lebanon and Syria in an "un-
precedented buildup."

The Israeli patrol struck across
the border following two clashes
near the Israeli settlement of
Baram.

In the first incident, on Wed-
nesday, an Arab and an Israeli
soldier were killed, the spokes
man said.

A patrol searching the area
Thursday killed a second guer-
rilla, then crossed the border in
pursuit of other raiders, chasing
them to the Lebanese village of
Yaroun, he said.

The spokesman did not men-
tion the massacre in Munich, for
which Israeli newspaper editor-
ials have urged swift retaliation.

The Palestinian agency re-
ported scveral Israeli tank
columns took up positions near
Lebanon and Syria while beli-
copters landed troops through-
out the dav.

Jews Warned

by Anthony Collings
Associated Press Writer

BONN, AP — West German
Jews were warned Thursday that
terrorists may try to kill them
this weekend with bomb pack-
ages disguised as Jewish New
Year's gifts.

At the same time, police
tightened security after a re-
p0rlt‘(l threat of fresh violence
by Arab guerrillas unless West
(iermany releases the three
Arabs who survived Tuesday's
Olympics massacre that left It
Israelis, 5 Arabs and 1 German
policeman dead.

Cairo ofﬁcials of being partly
responsible for the horror deaths
in Munich.

Chancellor Willy Brandt's
government told the 32,000
Jews in this country that it
received a tipoff from an un-
disclosed foreign source that
they may bc the targets of
mailed bombs this weekend
during Rosh Hashunah.

A» German Interior Ministry
spoIEesman did not identify the
terrorists. He said the packages
may be sent from various places
in Europe by persons pretending
to be business people,

In Munich, Police Chief Mari-
frcd Schreibcr said at a news
conference the hostages had
been "doomed men" regardless
of German actions.

"Our only hope to save them
was if the Arabs made a mis-
take," he said.

Schrcibcr said the Israeli
government had repeatedly rv~
fused to yield to terrorist dr-
nninds that 200 Arabs Itt‘ltl Ill

Israel be freed in exchange for
the hostages.

He added that Tel Aviv ex-
pressed full confidence in the
measures of the German police
and only recommended that
they try to stall for the maxi-
mum amount of time.

The games went on discon-
solately, the ﬁve-ringed Olympic
flag at half staff. Munichers
watched in dazed near-silence,
their hopes shattered of staging
the “Getmutlich"-friendly,
happy, carefree-Olympics.

The Black September Palestine
commando group threatened in
a radio broadcast to “deal Ger-
many a heavy blow” if the three
terrorists being held for their
part in the massacre are not
released.

The group, named for the
September in 1970 when King
Hussein crushed the guerrilla
movement in Jordan, claimed
one of its teams carried out the
attack on the Israeli team.

Commenting on reports of new
threats by Arab guerrillas, chief
government spokesman Conrad
Ahlers said “all imaginable and
necessary” security precautions
had been taken.

Police have guarded the Israeli
Embassy in Bonn since the mas-
sacre of 26 people at Lod airport
in Israel earlier this year.

The Egyptian government said
in Cairo it had nothing to do
with the shooting and that West
Germany must bear full respon-
nihility.

TRAGEDY

 

AND AFTERMATH

Killers Hunted

by John Vinocur
Associated Press Writer

MUNICH, AP - West German
police hunted for 15 more Arabs
today and pressed an inVesti-
gation into the airﬁeld killing of
nine Israeli hostages on Tuesday.

Bavarian state police said the
15 were suspected of being ac-
complices in the planning and
execution of the Arab terrorist
attack Tuesday that killed two
other members of the Israeli
Olympic team and culminated in
the airﬁeld shootout.

Five of the terrorists and a
West German policeman also
were killed at the airfield. A
German helicopter pilot was
seriously wounded. Three of the
terrorists were captured slightly
wounded.

The three captives were iden-
tiﬁed as Ibrahim Badran, 20,
Abd Es Kadir El Dnawy and
Samer Mohamed Abdulah, both
22. They claimed to be students

The Olympic competition,

Israelis.

A Quiet Mun

CLEVELAND, OHIO AP -
Funeral services will be held
today for Olympian David
Berger, whose interest in the
birth of a nation inadvertently
led to his death.

Berger was one of 11 Israeli
representatives and athletes who
were killed Tuesday at the
Olympic Games in Munich.

Berger’s brother, Fred, 25, and'
sister, Barbara, 22, flew home
early Thursday aboard an Air
Force plane provided by Presi-
dent Nixon. They had watched
their brother compete in Munich
Saturday, then had gone to
Salzberg.

Their father said the President
called Wednesday night to ex-
press his sympathy and that of
the nation and to offer help if he
could be of any.

Berger was described as a
“gentle man, a quiet man," who
took up citizenship in Israel be-
cause “he wanted to be part of a
new country that was being
born."

Athletes React

MUNICH AP — Olympic
athletes went back to their
Sports, but many did so re~
luctantly.

Some proposed that some way
be found to demonstrate sym-
pathy for the 11 Israeli team
members who lost their lives in
an Aral) terrorist invasion of the
Olympic Village Tuesday.

Most of the athletes-including
many Amcricunﬂurveyed by
Associated Press reporters felt
the Games should continue. But
there were many with doubts.

An Italian hurdler, Sergio
Liani, suggested that medal
ceremonies during the remainder
of the Games be curtailed, that
national anthem not be played,
and that the awarding of medals
be done simply and quietly.

“I would prefer that the
Games stop," he said. “Many
athletes will have negative
psychological reactions. At least
there should be no more fanfare,
no more celebrations for vic-
tory."

A group of athletes gathered in
a corner of the Village-a
Ugandan hockey player, a Polish
girl runner, and a Pakistani track
competitor-felt the Games
should continue. But they
agreed that a tribute was in
order. They suggested that the
closing ceremony be changed.

Normally the closing cere-
mony, following the Games' last
equestrian event, features an in
formal march of athletes who
mingle rather than stick with
indideu_al teams.
