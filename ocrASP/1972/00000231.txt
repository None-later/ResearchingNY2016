Perhaps the most commonly

dents must stand in at the
opening of ,each semester.

It seems that the problems has
become particularly acute this
year. The much heralded ovsr-
night  Service (ODS),
designed' to provide students
with a minimal wait for books,
completely broke down. Stu-
dents opting for the overnight

service had to wait in line of up
to two hours. and on Wednesday
morning the system had become
so bogged down that the
decision was made to close down
ODS altogether.

And the situation in the regu-
lar booklines wasn’t much bet-
ter, by anybody's standards.
Although ﬁve and six hour lines
like last year's were not in evi-
dence, students complained that
the delays were still excessively
long, and that when they ﬁnally
were able to place their orders.
many of the orders were not
entirely filled because the run-
ners could not find all of the
titles.

Breakdown Blamed on Students

What was the cause of the
ODS's breakdown? And why
were the regular bookliniei so
long? Some quarters place the
blame on backstore mismanage-
ment. They contend that the FSA
operated facility has poor hiring
practices as student workers are
not obligated to show up on the
job. And they said? that the
management would have hired
students directly off the book-
lines as in previous yEars.

if the University bookstore is
having mismangagement pro-
blems, the bookstore brass are
the last to admit it.’I‘hey blame
the breakdown of ODS not on
management problems, but on

the students, and a critical lack
of space in which to place
packaged books. ODS orders
IredeivedlMonday were filled that
evening .siith the expectation
that students.‘ would return
Tuesday morning to pick up
their books. But according to
Bookstore Manager Arnold
Colon, a large number of these
students didn't show up until
the afternoon,‘by, which time a
severe backlog had developed.
There was not space to store all
of the accumulated, packaged
boods. Furthermore. a disastrous
backlog of customers rapidly
formed. The result was an “on-
slaught” resulting in “mass con-
fusion" and ultimately the
decision toshut 0m down com-
pletely.

According to Colon, it was not
worker absenteeism that led to
the ODS breakdown and long
delays on the regular line. The
problem of absenteeism is negli-
gilie, he claims, and he feels that
student cooperation has been
"wonderful". Another of the
bookstore personnel, however,
says that out of 125 students
hired, only 80 to 100 actually
showed up, and that this
absenteeism is "bound to
seriously affect” service. John
Kot, operation manager, did
point out, however, that in most
years the absenteeism problem
has been much more chere, and
that students have been es-

New Book Listing

Many students have wondered
why the management decided to
list books by author rather than
by section or professor, as is
usually done. The new listing
requires students to go to class
first to find out the names of the
authors unless the student
decides to road thtough long lists
of section numbers until he finds
the number of his course, a
rather lengthy process.

According to Colon, the reason
for making the change was to
"get the bookstore out of the
refund and exchange business."
Usually students buy all of the
books listed without first atten-
ding class. When they do finally

SEPTEMBER 8, 1972

 

 

by Glenn von Nostrtz‘

In many important ways the
1972 SUNY Master Plan released
last month by Chancellor Ernest
Boyer differs from the plan
drawn up four years ago by a
much different administration
during the height of the campus
turmoil. A lot has happened
during those four years to both
the educational philosophy and
the state's ﬁnancial situation;
development of which are re-
flected in this latest master plan.

The campus disruptions were
responsible for what seem to
have been a major change in
educational philosophy among
the more progressive admini—
strators. Many university fathers
came to realize during those four
years the magnitude of the
educational needs, and began to
think about making some
fundamental changes in their
educational philosophy.

Meanwhile, the state's ﬁnancial
condition continued to deteri-
orate, as was seen in the annual

budget cuts and the inevitable
hiring freezes throughout the 72
campus SUNY system. It seemed
that when the administration
finally became aware that there
were great and pressing educa-
tional needs, the ﬁnancial re-
sources suddenly vanished.

To some extent, then, the 1972
Master Plan is an attempt to
reconcile the new educational
philosophy with the realities of
the fiscal crisis. The master plan
proposes to do this through the
establishment of various “inno-
vative” programs, as Chancellor
Boyer terms them, which are an
attempt to “do more with less".

Dramatic Cutbacks

The cutbacks are most drama-
tically seen in the proposed
construction expenditures and
student enrollment. While the
old plan called for $2.9 billion
worth of new construction
during the next decade, the new
plan calls for only a $900 mil-
lion expenditure, most of which
will go toward construction of
the University at Buffalo’s new
Amherst Campus. The other
colleges and universities can
expect little or no major buil-
ding programs on their cam-
puses.

The number of projected full-
time students has similarly been
slashed from 393,000 in the old
plan to a projected 323,500 by
1980, a decrease of almost 20%.

In spite of the severe ﬁscal
cutbacks, university officials are
quick to point out that there
will still be growth, and that
attempts will still be made to
meet the newly recognized
needs. Most of this growth,
however, will be concentrated in
the “innovative” program now
being developed, while the
existing campuses can expect
little or no expansion whatso-
ever.

The “innovative” programs
include several projects that have

received nationwide attention,

‘such as the non-residential Em»

pire State College, and the three
emerging campuses at Purchase,
Old Westbury and Herkimer-
Rome-Utica.

Receiving the most attention
has been Empire State College,
which allows students to work
for degrees away from the con-
ventional campuses and class-
rooms, a concept which the
(Iliancullor refers to as “the uni»
versity without walls."

Boyer claims that the other
three emerging colleges are not
of the old ones,
each being “unique in its own
way." The College at Purchase,
for example. is designed mostlv

serving the university community

 

to prepare professionals in the
visual and performing arts. The
Old Westbury college will con-
duct a “campus in dispersion”
which will include a network of
study centers on Long Island
focusing primarily on transfer
students from regional com-
munity colleges.

The Herkimer-Rome-Utica
facility, on the other hand, will
admit only upper division
students -— juniors and seniors —
as well as ﬁrst year graduate
students, and will stress the
applied sciences and technology.

And for those students who
still prefer the traditional four
year, structured college, the

 

Boyer

master plan envisions the crea-
tion of “classical colleges" with-
in two or more already existing
colleges. The “classical colleges”
would be for those students and
faculty who feel uncomfortable
in the innovative programs, and
would emphasize traditional
courses and teaching mrthods.

 

ovarian:

 

 

"mth 1912 Master Plan is in attempt to

reconcle the new educationd philosophy with

the remiss of the ﬁscal crisis.”

 

 

Few new,vbold, or even liberal
programs are called for in the
master plan on the Albany
campus. Instead, the emphasis is
on consolidation and continuing
along basically the same educa-
tional path as before.

The master plan did make
some mention of Albany State's
Allen Collegiate Center, the
time-shortened bacallesurate
program that accepts high school
juniors into the university.

SUNY Central Administration
has placed a great deal of im-
portance on varying the educa-
tional pattern by bringing per-
sons of different aw groups on
campus. Various plans for doing
this are now in the works, from
allowing students to take off a
year after high school to work or
travel and being assured of a
place when they return, to pro«
grams allowing students to in-
terrupt their college educations
for other activities.

One of the most far-reaching
and potentially effective pro‘
grams along this line has been
dubbed "educare", and would
extend the learning process to
retired persons. “Educare” is

 

“students won't feel most of the effects

of innovation for some time to come.”

 

 

Little Innovation Here

The need for “classical col-
leges“ shouldn't prove too
overwhelming, however, as most
SUNY students won't be in-
volved in the innovative pro»
grams. Most of the innovaiiun is
confined to the emerging col-
leges; the average university
student won't feel most of the
offer-ta~ of innovation for some
time to come.

Here at Albany State the
amount of actual "innovation"
will be small. The Albany cam-
pus hus already had considerable
bad luck with at least. one inno-
vative program, pass‘fail grading,
and is now returning to more
traditional grading methods.

 

SEPTEMBER 8, 1972

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

aimed at bringing senior citizens
on campus and into the class-
room, changing the whole
character of the campus in the
process. People of all ages,
especially the young and old,
would be seen walking on Cam-
pus, in classes and in the dining
balls.

The "educare" program is also
part of a wider attemth to

provide greater interaction with
the outside community. This is
also supposed to be done
through cooperation with
community leaders, who would
work in conjunction with uni-
versity professors in offering
new courses. SUNY Albany’s
journalism project being offered
for the ﬁrst time this semester is
an example of this sort of
development. The project brings
various professionals from the
area media on campus, conduc-
ting sennnurs and working
closely wttli students and
faculty.

New Research Centers

The new educational philoso»
phy is mirrored in the proposed
new research centers, as well at
the other innovative programs.
The presently existing canton:
deal mainly With advanced
scientiﬁc research, such as
Albany's Atmospheric Sciences
Research Center and the Marine
Sciences Center at Stony Brook.

  
   
   

The newly proposed aliens on
the other hand, will deal mainly
with problems in the humanities
and social sciences, including a
center for the study of aging,
one for study of migratory
Ward another center for
urban studies. The Albany carn-
pus is slated to get a State and
Local Government Research
Center.

Not a Perfect Plan

The 1972 Master Plan may
seem to many observers to be
imaginitive, innovative and even
daring. But others, particularly
various student leaders on SUNY
campuses, have criticized the
plan for not being innovative
enough. They claim that it is
superficial because most stu-
dents will not be affected by the
reforms and new programs at all.
They complain that the reform
and innovation is being confined
entirely to the emerging cam-
puses.

Then there are the pessimism,
those who feel that the Master
Plan is a utopian scheme in-
capable of implementation.
They agree with the id ms behind
the plan, but doubt the admini-
stration's sincerity in actually
implementing their own pro-

one can get the feeling that
the 1972 Master Plan is really

only half of a plan, and that
the university would have gone
much further if it only had the
resources. The administrators
speak of how much they hope to
accomplish through their latest
plans. But it is possible to detect
in their voices a bit of remorse —-
remorse at those who were
responsible for shutting off the
generous flow of funds enjoyed
for so many years.

The 1972 Master Plan is a
“make do" plan. The ad-
ministrators must "make do‘
with limited resources; but s'.ill
achieve their lofty educational
goals. And that, it seems, is how
all of these innovatiVe programs
came about. They were an at-
tempt to do “more with less".

Perhaps the Master Plan will
never be implemented at all.
Perhaps it is too idealistic. But
whatever the outcome, the
SUNY administration has cer—
tuinly made some imaginative
and potentially fur-reaching
proposals, proposals which are
likely to spark alot of lively
debate in the future.
