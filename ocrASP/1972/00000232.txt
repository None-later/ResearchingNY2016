   Students Gear Up

' for Campus
McGovern Drive

The mmpus McGovern cam-
paign got off to an midni-
start last week in Campus Carter
375. Well over 160 enthusiastic
campm slipportera
turned out to hear appeah for
their bdp in the upcoming fall
campaign in Albany County.

Addressing the gathering were
Brian Mom, an Albany State
unit: and media directs! for the
local McGovern effort, and
George McNamee, campaign
coordinator for the Albany area.

They spoke of the need to sign
up strident volunteers 8 un-
v‘us, manning tabla, and
doing clerical work at McGovern
headquarters on Central Avenue.
Foru- were passed out to stu-
dents attending the meeting
uking about previous campaign
expaience, special talents, and
job preferences. Donation were
also solicited.

The meeting was also told of
theneed to carry Albany County
because of its impedance to
carrying the state, which is, in
turn, “important if we are to
win the election." According to
Moss, the plan is to nuke
Albany County the spotlight of
the state and even the nation,
where McGovern people and re-
gular Democrats can work in
close cooperation for a common

localism. The President has been
consistent and uncompromising
on these issues throughout his
administration, speaking through

television sets that would bring
in $408100 million each year in
continuing revenue free from
political control. But last year's
entire CPB budget was a mere
$35 million, and the bill Nixon
vetoed called for only $65 mil-
lion this ﬁscal year and $90
million the next. There is still no
excise tax on TV sets, nor are
the prospects of one likely.

The Commission’s own
sweeping pronouncements
about program diVersity, free
flow of information and the
public interest are all very rice,
but the proposed structure of
the CPB, ostensibly founded to
avoid political pressure, make
those high-sounding goals seem a
little ridiculous. The President
was to appoint 6 of the 12
members, with his appointees
selecting the remaining six mem-

Middle Earth Continues Willi New Plan: For ’72

The Middle Earth Project, which encompasses the

tion Program and a Student Counseling Program
operates out of Ten Eyck hall on Dutch Quad.
Middle Earth is run on a noniudgmental philoso-
phy, not offering advice but providing alternatives.
It’s a referral centei, hurling information concer-
ning most any student problem. It focuses on the
campus community and its conﬂicts, among them
pregnancy, (Imp, administration, peer groups,
parents and friends (or the lack of them). It
providm an outlet for those who are frustrated,
disgusted, lonely or confused. It connects students
with all forms of off campus aid, state and private.
Discussions are conﬁdential. The tone is friendly,
rational and one of persepective.

SllllYA Crime Study Released

by Eddy Trink

Professor Robert Hardt of the
School of Criminal Justice, has
recently completed putting to
gether a study of crime on the
SUNY at Albany campus. The
survey, entitled “A Victimiza-
tion Survey of Resident Stu-
dents on the SUNYA Campus,"
was conducted in the spring of
1972 and consde of a que—
tionaire which was answered by
137 randoniy selected students
living in dam on campus.

The report indicates that most
crimes committed on the Alhny
campus were petty theft, where
either cash or personal property
worth unrkr $25 was taken.
Ibweva, the study also indi-
ntes that a majority of the
thefts occurred on the Colonial
and Ind‘mn Quads 3 compared
to State and Dutch Quads
where only 14% of dormitory
thefts were reported. Hardt
acknowledged that there is no
apparent explanation for th‘n
diaepancy. Of the forty stu-
dents who indicated that they
had been robbed, only half
stated that they reported the
thefts tosecurity. With regard to
the level of crime on campus,
58% of the students reported

that the amount of crime on
campus either increased or
remained the same, while only
16% indicated that it decreased;
26% had no idea. Three-quarters
of those interviewed also indica-
ted that between thirty and
ninety percent of all thefts are
committed by resident stu-
dents. Other questions in the
survey covered various aspects of
how students protect themselves
from campus crime.

One other qustion in the sur-
vey did cover a rating of various
aspects of student life. Students
were asked whether certain
facilitea and upsets of campus
life were satifsctory, could
stand improvement, or needed
real improvement. It was found
that students rated their rela—
tiondrips with black students,
food service, parking facilities,
and crime on campus, in that
order, as the things in need of
the most 

Hardt, who conducted a
similar survey in the spring of
1971, intends to conduct
another this coming spring. He
hopes that these type of studies
can pinpoint chages in attitudes
about crime 0'8. a number of
years.
