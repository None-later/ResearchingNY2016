Fanaticism and Law: The lrresolvable Conflict

The“Cause”above the Law

The brutal slaying of 11 mem-
bers of the Israeli Olympic Team
brings into focus certain seem-
ingly irresolvable Conflicts en-
countered in dealing with the
ghastly actions of what has been
described as a fanatical group.
At least one dictionary deﬁnes a
fanatic as someone with "exces-
sive enthusiasm and intense un-
critical devotion." Important in
this definition, and essential for
comprehending the irresolvablc
conﬂict, are the words “uncriti-
cal" and "excessive." ’I'he fana-
tic, because he is a fanatic, does
not act out of logic, he acts
uncritically. His devotion to his
cause is illogical (or it would not
be fanatical) and the means he
employs toward his objective re-
flect both his “excessiVe en‘
thusiasm" and “intense un-
critical devotion."

'I‘he fanatic does not act judi-
ciously; e.g. he does not act in
accordance with commonly or
universally accepted guidelines
and, more importantly, he re-
fuses to admit that these guide»
lines apply to him. The fanatic
has his own standards and me
thods and therefore plays by his
own rules. The rules of society'
its laws, moral standards, guides
to action—have no influence on
his behavior since he places his
"cause" above the law and acts
by rules (his own rules) which
reﬂect this.

Retribution is payment for a
crime. For it crin e to be com-
mitted a rule or law must be
broken. But the fanatic rejects
the notion that the rules of
society apply to him. He has his
own rules and usually these rules
come into conflict with those

by Mitchell Frost

that govern society. So when he
employs methods which while
adhering to his own private set
of rules break the laWs of the
larger society, he has committed
no crime, he maintains. Society’s
laws are not legitimate and do
not apply to him. And when
society exacts a penalty upon
him for his crimes he views this
penalty as a criminal action in
itself and not as a punishment or
retribution (witness the Black
Panther philosophy). So the
fanatic cannot "pay" for his
crimes, as can the more common
criminal who recognizes the
legitimacy of the law but
chooses to break it anyway,
from the fanatic, the most that
can be exacted is society's pro-
verbial “pound of flesh."
Recognizing that the fanatic
plays by his own rules, how far
will he go and how much is be
willing to risk? The Arab guer»
rillns havr- shown it willingness to
die for their cause and have
employed methods so out
rageous that death was inevtt
able. But death is omnipresent
where the fanatic is concerned.
His enthusiasm is "excessive"
and devotion “intense.” Death is
not something to be feared but
to be avoided where possible as
an obstacle to the completion of
the undertaking. 'I'he fanatic ac-
cepta death as a symbol of his
unyielding devotion to the
cause. Thus he cannot be de-
terred by threats of punishment
for unless he repents, if I can use
that word, he can never be
punished, at least not in this
world, only martyred. So the

conflict between the fanatic and
society remains unresoIVed.

So if he cannot be deterred,
what can we do about liim'.’
Well, once he has committed his
crime he can be locked up and
removed to where he can no
longer assail law and order, the
basis of every civilized society.
This is done not to punish him
for his misdeeds, though that is
one of its espoused purposes,
but to protect innocent law-
abidiiig citizens from those who
refuse to respect legitimately es
tablished laws and rights. But we
want to intercedi- before he can
wreak havoc on the community.
How can we do this?

Since we have already deter
mined that the fanatic cannot be
deterred from his goal, we must
at least make it hard for him.
Firstly, the resources which the
fanatic must draw upon, as any
criminal needs resources, must
be dried up. 'l‘ylng this in With
the present crisis, the Arab gucr
rillas get most of llll‘lr money
equipment passports, i-tc _ lrorri
sources insidi- IA‘Illilllill and
Syria. 'l'lime countries must take
firm positive steps to cut off the
supplies which flow to the gucr
rilla forces. If they cannot or
will not, then the rest ofltlie
world could act in unison
through the UN. perhaps, til
crush the guerrilla forces inside
the Arab countries. As both
these alternatives are unlikely
Israel could invade Syria, Lelia:
non, and any other neighboring
country which harbors fanatical
Arab guerrillas in order to insure
her own security and ‘jllcuru

the
safety of her citizens

SUNYA Draft Counseling Lauded

To the Edilor:

I was recently accorded the
unfortunate opportunity of
being classified l-A and on the
verge of receiving a “GREET-
INGS” notice. I turned in des-
peration to the SUNYA Draft
Counseling Service and received,
in my estimation, very excellent
and competent counseling.

I refer specifically to Dave
Messick, the Director, who de-
voted a wealth of time (at my
convenience, not his) in hashing

out my problem--providing me
with meaningful advice and in—
formation. His counseling was
both reassuring and knowledge—
able. Thanks to Dave (I couldn‘t
have done so without his help) I
am free of the notorious Selec~
tive Service. In many ways our
counselors’ efforts go unnoticed,
and I think the SUNYA Draft
Counseling Service deserves our
campus appreciation.

Dear President Bertezet:

I am an alumnus of SUNYA
(Class of '71) whom you might
remember for my activities in
the University Senate and as
chairman of a Student Affairs
Council committee. I recall the
verbal commitments to the cause
of social justice which arrived
with your administration, and I
applaud all steps taken in this
direction. I now write to insure
that you are aware of a great
cause, in the hope that you will
unequivocally stand with the
side of justice.

The cause I write of is that of
the United Farmworkers Union
ind the national boycott of
non-UFW lettuce. Since leaving
Albany I have seen the grave
injustices inflicted upon farm'
workers and their sole vehicle
towards' equality— theii‘ union.
There is no doubt that their
cause is just. Farmworkcrs in
Arizona are lucky to get their
minimum wage of $1.60/houi
since they must compete with
“wetbacks” (illegal workers)
who will often work for half of
that wage. For all of the hard»
ships placed upon the farm-

worker there are few rewarth.
Today's farmworker is that c'o.
vered by' unemployment Insur-
ance, not coverEd by workmen‘s
compensation. Even children
who work on farms are speciﬁ-
cally exempted from child labor
laws.

The boycott is the only effec-
tive non-violent tool available to
the union. Agricultural em-
ployees are not as easily com-
municated with as urban wor-
kers. (This problem is intensified
by the thousands of migrant
workers who have no real
homes). Strikes are broken by
importing illegal workers (a tac-
tic which the Nixon admini-
stration gives tacit approval of)
or by duping students into
strike-breaking. In Arizona, Ida-
ho, and Kansas, bills have been
passed which cripple any signifi-
cant union activity. In Arizona,
the bill not only makes strikes
illegal, but anyone who says
"boycott lettuce’ can be fined
up to $5,000 and/or imprisoned
for up to one year.

These conditions and these
laws exist because wealthy grov
wers (often small farmers like
Tenneco, Bank of America, and
Greyhound) place their own

greed above the dignity of their
employees. The onlyj language.
enterprises like these understapd
is dollars and cents. g This [is
where the boycott cornea inijffi
consumers refuse to buy non~l
UFW lettuce, it will forcel the
growers into negotiating con1
tracts. Lettuce picked by Team;
sters (i.e. Iceberg) should alsovble
boycotted because these union
contracts were signed at the re-
quest of the employers rather
than the employees. ‘
As President of SUNYA, I,now
ask you to join the boycotters‘ at
non-UFW lettuce, and to dd
whatever possible towards insu-
ring that no campus facility (i.e.
Dining Halls, cafeterias) serves
any lettuce other than lettuce
bearing the UFW’s Black Thun-
derbird trademark. Your cooper-
ation in this matter would do
much to fulfill the announced
commitment of your administra-
tion to the cause of justice for
all human beings. You are a tall
man, and now the opportunity
to stand tall with pride on the
side ofjustice presents itself.

Respectfully yours,
Barry Kirschner

good anti-Caiinunists smoke
pot. Once the more hardened
traditionalists soften, die, or try
it themselves, marijuana will be
regarded as just another social
amenity.

From a radical viewpoint, the
effects of widespread, accepted
and legal use of grass are pro-
blematic. The Black Panthers,
stern revolutionaries, long ago
banned all drugs from their poli-
tics. Operating from the van-
tage-point of the colonized
Black, they saw how drugs kept
people down and. only stoned
the revolution.

The search for a “high” sub-
stitutes an ephemeral goal for
the awareness of life's ugly rea-
lities. PM can serve the same
purpose for potential white revo-
lutionaries. At some level of use,
and at some ebb of political
awareness, grass ceases to he
liberating and becomes dullirig.
It makes the present liveiible.
Especially in suburbia, pot seems
to serve the same function for
teenagers as booze, sex iIlI(I suc-
cess serve for their parents:
they all make boredom and iso-
lation palatable.

You needn't assume il (‘llII'
spiracy in guvcr' menl, but only
that some powerful men in Llilh
country tl’i‘ intelligent (which is
at Icnat somewhat plausible), to
speculate that our lenders are
looking on drug use with in-
creasing l'iivrir. Liki- selling wliiir
key to the Iiidiiiiis, it works. A
lot of frustrations (and potential
trouble) iiri- dispelled by getting
loaded.

Similarly, legalization of man-
juanii can Iielp to hand off po~
tcntial trouble for the American
economy. Our system of state
capitalism requires predictable
consumers, and, in pot, the ecu
noiny will find one more stou-
dily expanding market among
young people.

It's ii well-known fact that the
big tobacco conglomerates are
already gearing up to corner this
huge new market. The pro-
ponents of legal pot shrug off
this prospect. They point to the

advantages of industrializing
grass: it would put crooked
dealers out of business, furnish a
better and cheaper product-- and
you could still grow your own.

Such touching faith in an eco-
nomic system so many of us call
corrupt is sorely misplaced. A
more consistent approach indi-
cates that pot after legalization
would probably be mass-pro-
duced (and eVentually syn-
thetic), of poorer quality. just as
costly as it is now—vand there‘d
belittle room for competition, if
the sales of cigarettes or autos
are any guide.

It seems, appearances other-
wise to the contrary, that many
of us still believe the free enter-
prise system is free. Or, rather,
we bemoan the evils of capi-
talism,only to forget them when
it's grass-mot cars or color
TV's--that the marketplace oro—
mises to give us. Isn’t it hypo-
critical to buy a chunk of the
system only if the price is right?

And if pot's made legal, we'll
have to silence that line we've
given our parents for years: that
objects are not liberating. If
we're sickened by their material-
ism, their mass-produced needs,
their resort to pills or the bot-
tle, Wt‘ can't say it’s “dif-
l't-reiit” when we want our thing
sanctioned.

In The I‘ul‘h‘ull ii/ Loneliness,
I’hilip Sliiler remarks that drug
users “may be enjoying the cur-
rent more, btit they are still
plugged into the same machinery
that drives other Americans on
their Weary and joylesa round."
By expecting too much from
marijuana, and too easily accept-
ing its pleasurable effects, we
may ultimater electrocute our—

Many present pot laws require
"cruel anti unusqu punisli~
merit" and clearly must be soft-
ened. But legalizing grass could
well give the American economy
and its free enterprise myth-
ology their biggest shot iii the
arm in years. And that fix might
