WINGERT

NEW COACH

by Ralph Mohr

This fall there is a new face
among the coaches at the Uni-
versity gym. Joining thecoaching
ranks at Albany will be Norm
Wingert, a graduate student who
will be in charge of the Booters
for a year.

In the Hartwick College grad-
uate, Albany hopes it has found
the leadership, skill, and desire
necessary to produce a winning
soccer team.

Although last season was a
disastrous one for the team,
Coach Wingert will find some
talent remaining from last year’s
2-9 squad.Coach Wingert feels
that team captains Larry Herzog

"',_.-.(stxting fullback), Uzi Haimoff

(starting wing), and John 'l‘hayer,
(goalie) will give 100% all the
time.

John Thayer, one of last year's
outstanding goalies in New York
State, now suffering from torn
ligaments, will be back in the
nets very shortly for the Danes.
Three other veterans who have
excelled in practice thus far are
George Keleshian (halfback),
Carlos Alvarez (starting insides).
and John Streeter at sweeper
fullback. Mark Solano, who has
been away from Albany but not.
soccer the last two years. has
returned to star at winged full-
back.

How much this year's team
will improve is hard to say. The
talent is there; it is now up to
the players to decide how far
they wish to go.

 

Runners Look
Strong Again

by Kenneth Arilurno

Albany's cross country team is
preparing for its eleventh season
under Coach Bob Munsey and it
looks like another great year.
Munscy's men have a ten year
record of 87 wins and 18 losses
and are coming off u very suc-
cessful l0—3 record and are the
defending SUNYAC champs.

The team has lost three top
runners from last year including
the two Albany record holder»,
Brian Quinn (in the 5 mile) and
Dennis llackett (in the 3% mile).

Even though these men, along
with assistant coach Larry Fred-
crick, were the backbone of last
year's club. the team bus found
replacements. Returning letter-
men Scott Abercrombie, John
Koch, Bill ﬂoral, and Bob Elias
form a strong core of experi-
ence.

The big news is a transfer from
lt‘nrdhum, Vinnie ltedu. Reds is

already cast as one of Albany‘s
top runners. The new “Fordham
Flash” brings big meet experi—
ence to an already seasoned
club.

Another runner counted on is
Nick DeMarco, who sat out last
year With injuries. Nick was the
number two runner two years
ago and is expected to return to
that form. John Stanton, injured
last year, also returns.

The Albany team takes on a
new foe early this year when it.
travels to West Point. The Army
may be the toughest. on an alv
rcudy rough schedule. The first
meet is at Brockport September
16 with the Danes returning
home a week later to face the
Coast Guard and Montclair
State.
