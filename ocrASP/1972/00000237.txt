There is one very big question mark in Albany's
Donas’ upcoming fall baseball season: Nick Aseien-
‘iio's pitching am. Last year, Nick made the
SUNYAC all-star team with a phenomenal 0.84
ERA, but, to put it very bluntly, this year it‘s sore.

Without Nick, our pitching staff will be led by
veteran Kevin Quinn and newcomer Dave Bentley,
both of whom ’show great promise. Jack Leahy,

last, year‘s superb catcher (.327 batting average)
will be back, as will Bill Lapp (3rd base), Ray Ang-
rilla, and Ken Large. Newcomers Bentley and Terry
Kenney are being counted on to produce some of
the badly needed offense we lacked last year. The
team is muhd rout with Dan Deforut at shortstop,
Bill Hopkins at second base, and Steve Devito, jack
of all trad. The major loss is Frank Castaldo to
football.

Without Nick's million dollar arm, the Danes
will flirt with the .500 mark all year. With Nick, the
Danes can and should make some real noise.

Coach Burlingame deplored the lack of interest
in the sport, on both the fans and the students part.
When only 14 boys go out for a sport of this signi-

It might be rough going for Coach bob Ford’s.
Albany State football team. Ford’s main problem
will be what is he going to do about a quarterback.
Right now there are four candidates for the job.
Last season’s second stringer Rich Petty, who
ﬁgured to move up this year, decided to forego
football because of personal reasons. Adding to
Ford’s problems is the status of ace running back
Bernie Boggs. Boggs is suffering from a bad back
and will not play this season. With the likes of R.I.’I‘.,
Brockport, Hudson Valley and Siena on the sche-
dule, the Dane will be hard pressed to better last
year’s record of 4-4.

Belated congratulations to Albany distance runner
Dennis Hackctt who graduated last May. Hackett
was named the 1972 recipient of the Scholar-
Athlete of the year at Albany. Hackett was a
member of both the track and cross country‘teams.

Combined totals of last year’s 11 intercollegiate
teams shows Albany posting a 76-55-2 record. Two
of those teams, cross country and tennis, were

 

 

More headaches for the soccer team. Soccer Ciach
Bill Schiefflein has been suspended from coalc ;ng
for one year for disciplinary reasons. Rep a;
Schiefflein is Albany graduate student Norm rill
gert. Wingert, a former goalie from HartWick, wr
have his work cut out for him. The hooters have
been somewhat of a disappointment in the past fgalo
years, posing a measly 2-9 record last year: A.
season from the soccer team this year might be

asking too much.

ma be on the way for the entire athletic
relclretlijtmenltI program for 1973. The university has
adopted a talented student admissions program that
will set aside a maximum of 5% of each freshman
class for students displaying excellence in a particu-
lar ﬁeld. This should prove a big plus for all .of the
intercollegiate teams since in the past recruitment
has been hampered by the academic standard. in
total the Athletic Department could receive no
more than 13 students through this program in any
one year. Football Coach Bob Ford will be the

 
  

    

 

dance, it is not only disappointing, but a disgrace.
The team does not even have a manager. For those
of you who are too busy to try out for the team,
and for anyone with school spirit, the first home
game is against Potsdam, a major rival who we must
best. This game counts in the SUNYAC standings
for the spring. So get off your fat rear ends and get
down to the baseball diamond on Saturday, Septem-
ber 16 for the big 1:00 doubleheader. The team

needs your support.

MORE HELP FOR BATMEN

by Richard Mark Yanku

During the 1972 spring base»
ball season two baseball players
were trying to help their respec-
tive team win the NJCAA rc-
gionals at. Monroe Community
College at Monroe, NY. Co»
bleskill Ag & 'l‘cch. was playing
Hudson Valley CO in the first
game of the rcgionals and the
former won it, 3-2. At the time,
Dave Bentley, pitcher and so-
cond baseman was playing for
the Cobleskill Tigers and Terry
Kcnny, centerficldcr was playing
for the Vikings of ll.V.(_l.C.

Today, both of them.- standouts
arc transfer students to Albany
State playing for Bob Bur-
lingamcs' Great Danes varsity
baseball team. And now, instead
of battling each other, they will
be trying to put their efforts
together and pull a few wins for
Albany during the fall baseball
season.

Duvc Bcntlcy, ll nutch of
Gloversville,achicvod ii 4-1-1

pitching mark for the Tigers last
year. He allowed only 5 earned
runs over 41 innings for an ERA
mark for nine innings of 1.10.
He struck out 33, walked only
nine, and hurled three complete
games, including one shutout.
Dave also excelled at the bat,
with a .320 batting average in-
cluding four doubles, one triple,
and 16 ltBl'u. He averaged one
run batted in for every bit he
got, sixteen RBl’s-sixtccn bust.-
hits!

’i‘crry Kenny, a product of
Cardinall McCloskcy High
School in Albany, won the
gdden glove award for fielding at
l'lVCC in 1971. Ho wound up
last season batting .305 (18 hits
in 59 trips to the plate), scoring
ninc runs, knocking in eleven,
and became one of only two
Vikings to hit over .300. Jay
Silvorman, publicity director at
llVCC, said that Tony was ii
"ltuzil comr-r In tln- 1972 barn»
ball year "

in this writers' opinion, Kenny
is a natural for playing center-
field. He has speed, agility, and
most important, a great throw-
ing arm. As Dave Bentley put it,
“he is unbelievably accurate."
The Texas Rangers and Kansas
City Royals scouted his fine
talents last season, but at that
time did not offer anything to
him. However, he will un-
doubtedly be scouted again this
year and next, and will most
likely be offered ll major league
contract. Asked if he would lilkt‘

QB JOB IN QUESTION

by Mike lgoe

An apt title for describing
the prospects of the Albany
State Football Club in 1972
might be "The Year of the Ques-
tion.”

When Head Coach Bob Ford
and his staff opened training
camp last week, they found
themselves confronted with an
abundance of uncertainties. Bc-
sides the usual toll taken by
graduation, il‘ll! Albany roster al-
so showed 21 number of key ploy-
crs missing for Ulll' rr-uson or an»
other.

Coach Ford, “These situations
have left us a little thin in
spots."

But all is not dismal for the
Great Danes.

As Assistant Coach Ray
Murphy put it, “We probably
have the most talent we’ve ever
had. It's just a matter of getting
it to gel.” From practices have
emerged a number of players
who scam rl‘ildy to do the job.

Freshmen Marvin Perry and
Noel Walker buvc l)t'l'll impress-
ivv in priiclir-c. Also Albany
should llith' plenty of di-plh ill.

task would be placing pi-oplc in-

coachiiig staff's questions will be
answered tomorrow when Al-

moves illld his consistency, for
be neither has sizc(5'9”-l701bs.)
nor blinding spci-d (5.0 in the
110).

Despite his impressive pcr-
l'ormuncc last season, Payne rc‘
mains ll rclativr- non-entity to
the fans. Not bcing a spectacular
runncr, he loses out on publicity
to guys like Briggs and Lonniel
Davis. Docs it bother Puync'.’
“No, because the people on cam-
pus and my friends know whciil
do a good job." Could he carry
the offensive load or emerge as a
leader of thc ol'fcnsc'.’ "Ycrili,
tlic QB'H look up to me iind
Lonnie (Davis). They feel more
confident when lll‘ and l are in."

Lonnie Davis like l’iiync,
cracked the Albufiy lineup as a
freshman. Davis cvontuully
wound up at fullback where he
gained 338 yards rind millli' .‘i
'I‘D's. He could hnvr- liiid morn,
but injuries forcvd him into
limiti'd action for tho lilh'l. .'i
giimcs.

Ford iii very optimistic about
Davis’s ullrt‘llClli'd potvntnil He
says that Duvn. doi-sn‘t know
how good he can bc. Lonnie
concurs, stating flint it's ll qur-s-

tion of the right mental attitude.
“Physically, I'm ready. 1 will do
better this year. It's a question
of learning how to psyche your-
self."

Although Ford feels that
Bogg's running abilities can be
replaced, hc wonders about
Bogg’s leadership qualities. I
asked Payne and Davis if they
felt they could or if they had to
become lenders. Davis: “We de-
finitely huve to become offen-
sive lenders. Both of us. We can

get the offense going if we pro-
vide the leadership." Payne
:igrccs, adding that, “We started
last your. The team looks up to
us."

The team is young. There are
29 freshmen on the squad. Even
the now crmtiiptiiins are only
sophomori-s (Arnie Will-line-
biickcr, and chon Andrcudis-
offensive tackle). if the offense
is to move, the two men to
provide thr- impetus will have to
ho Lonnie Davis and Cnrvin
l’uyno. UHUlllly, a young green
team like this is subject to being
ciitcn llllVl‘. But with two quality
running bileil to show the way,
perhaps the Danes can really
improve on their 4-4 record of
last year.
