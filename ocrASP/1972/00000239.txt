Recently I had the good for»
tune to come upon a most In)-
portant but olncure blues man.
He appeared in the South after
many years of abence on the
music scene. This man is Har-
monica Frank.
Now, what makes Frank so
important? He is a blues man
because, to us, he practices an
old art form in a very new way.
You see, Frank hm the amazing
ability to play both guitar and
harmonica at the same time.
Unusual? Not quite. But what is
so extraordinary about his music
is that he dots not make any use
of his hands or a stand in playing
the harmonica. Instead, he in-
serts the harp longways into his
mouth-rand plays his guitar si-
multaneoust Now, to top it all,
Prank can insert a second har-
monica between his upper lip
and his nose. And (imagine this!)
So all of you harmonica
virtuosos...0n your mark, get
set, BLOW!

Sex and the Reader

by Valerie Rapp

For people who are interested
in themselves, a good place to
focus that interest is on sex. Are
they being limited by sex or are
they aware of all the potential in
it’! Basically, what it gets down
to is roles—the various sexual
roles assigned by society, not
just the role; of housewife or
doctor but the entire role of
male or female. For instance,
certain qualities, such as tender-
ness or strength, are assigned as
masculine or feminine. Anyone
who thinks that thme qualities
are innate migrt reconsider if
they read up a bit on other
societies, where the assignment.
of qualitim to the sex is totally
different.

But for those who are pri-
marin concerned with their own
society, a number of good books
are around, to shake loose ideas
in your head and open your
mind to new paths. Simone de
Beauvoir’s The Second Sex tho-
roughly examinm woman's role
in modern society, how woman
is formed, myths about women,
and justiﬁcations. While the
chapter on biology is outdated,

the rest of the book is still

current. If you want to under-
stnd how thing came to be as
they are, Page Smith’s Daughters
of the Promised Land is a short,
readable history of American
women, perhaps more objective
than most women’s lib books.

For those who want the latest
on sex, they might try Germaine
Greer's The Female Eunuch. It
covers basically the same terri-
tory as The Second Sex; al-
though it lacks the same depth it
is a lot easier to read and shorter
as well. Besides, it’s divided into
sections such as "Curves,"
“Sex,” "Puberty," and “Ro-
mance," making it easy for you
to find your special interest.
Also, there's Kate Millett‘s
Sexual Politics, which has re~
ceived the whole spectrum of
comments from brilliant to lou—
sy. And as for politics, The
Dialectic 0/ Sex by Shulamith
Firestone, is about really bring-
ing the revolution home.

The opposing viewpoint is not
represented as well, at least by
modern writers, with Norman
Mailer being the most outstand-
ing of the opposition. Read his
The Prisoner of Sex for an at-
tack on Kate Millett, Germaine
Greer, etc.

Unfortunately, these books
deal mainly with what is and
little with what might be. While
an understanding of what is is
fundamental, looking ahead and
ﬁguring out whr't could be is
also important. Most impr rtnnt
of all is to make We Hard; 4; a
means to an end, the 510'. being
to act, to chimp, y- unwa and
others. You may as Well make
the most out of your sex, what-
ever it is.

Allly Pallcy that dimrsaed every Beethoven sym-
phony and which at to pt ifyou wereoolor-blind
or conscrvativs or ambimxtrous or all ofthe above.
As an outrapous plagrist and backstabbirg associ-
ate of Editor Palley, I feel compelled to add this
sequel dealing with one of the touchstones of the

orchestralilqmtr-e' .

Almost chry hater of classial music knows and
loves the W “I812” overture, that pro-
duct of (according to Sir Thomas Beecharn), “one
of the few composers with the unmnny ability to
drive you straight out of your skull.” The Schwann
Ll’ Catalog listed at one time 29 available Staeo
recording of the piece, so you an see that a
fortune may easily be wasted on reaming of this

one piece alone.

Well, different people want different things out of
life, so there is some philosophical basis for this sort
of overkill. Now, the question arises, whidr record-
ing do you want? Here is my rundown of the

situation:

If you always were fond of the fourth of July and
Hiroshima and other subtle nineties of life, I
strongly recommend the brand new lbs Anqu
Philharmonic recording with Zubin Mehta. This is
far and away the louder! recording of the l8l2. It is
available on the London label and is positively
guaranteed to disturb your suilemales ad museum.
The brass are not Io be believed (featuring of course

Iubisl Robcr Bobo).

The best overall performance of the work may be
heard on the old RCA Viclrola recording featuring
Frilz Rciner and the Chicago Symphony. It is nol
quite as "Hiroshima" as the London recording, due
to its age, lcfl handed RCA recording lechniqucs
and lhc mum: of Dr. Fritz. However, this one is
easier on the purse, as it goes for a mere $3.49.

Eugene ()rmandy and the Philadelphia orclreslra
have a recording oul on Columbia which is ﬁne, if
you agree that an orchestra should sound [be way
Philadelphia does on Ilrc Columbia label. I mighl
point oul llIaI l’lIIIIy courts a much larger string
scclron IlIan any other Amcrrran orclrcslra which. if
you are a vrulinisl. Is palatable.

l have never heard me Czech Philharmonic record-
Ing, buI I can roll you IlIIs about it: If you ﬁnd it on
the Supraplron label, grab it. It IS probably woth
Icn Iimrsrnorc than What you paId for il. However,
be wary of Arlia or Parliamanl recordings of [he
piece. They usually sound like they were recorded
al the bottom of New York Harbor.

The Berlin Philharmonic has armtirgwilh Her-
bcrl von Karajan on DOG that will cosl you seven
dollars and leave you dissappoimed. II is a compe-
Icnl recording whose princrplc flaw is than il docs
nor go beyond being merely competent. The ﬁdelity

Is (of course) super.

Leonard Bernslerrr and the New York Plrilhar‘
monic have a very Interesting versron oul. You can
always depend on Lenny Io be Ilrcalriial, and Ihrs is

rIglrl up his [in pan alley.

The Minneapolis ( nee Minnesora) Orchcslra has a
supnsrngly good rccurdrng of [he prcce our on the
Mercury label (the label bcrng Its worst feature).
'llIIs one is faIrly pcrcussrvc and ccrlzunly heals

many other recordings

Slay away from: the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra,
