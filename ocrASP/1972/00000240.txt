REGISTRATION
EXTENDED

New York (AH—A federal
court panel of three judges
Thursday directed that voter

,'_‘ " in New York State
continue through Sept. 23.

The justices held that a section
of the state election law which
had terminated general registra-
tion earlier, except for a brief
period in October, violated the
Voting Rights Act of 1970.

The ruling did not deal with a
challenge to the constitutional-
ity of the matter or with other
causes of action.

The Brooklyn federal court
panel on Aug. 31 extended the
deadline, setting it as Sept. 16 or
whenever it issued its ruling in a
suit brought by a group of stu-
dents represented by the New
York Civil Liberties Union.

The Special bench consisted of
Court of Appeals Judge Walter
R. Mansfield and District Judges
John Bartels and John F. Dool-
ing Jr.

It was u temporary restraining
order that had set the deadline
for Sept. 15 or whenever the
ruling was handed down in the
challenge to section 355 of the
state’s election law.

The court directed New York
City's and Nassau County’s clcc-
tion commissioners to make
available to voters the oppor-
tunity to register during rcgulur
business hours on at least four
weekdays per week until and
including Suturduy, Sept. 23.

The court's order directed New
York secretary of State John P.
Isomcnzo to notify election
boards in all the state's counties
of the decision und said, “the
responsibility will then full upon
each such board to comply."

The judges suid they con~
sidcrcd it unnecessary to decide
whether section 355 violates any
of the amendments to the Con-
stitution und they dismissed ccr~
tuin causes of action challenging
the requirement that voting regi-
strum bc rcprcsentutlvns ol' the
two lending political purtics
Democratic and Republican.

The 0 Civil Liberties Union hnd
charged thut ending registration
at election bonrd liuudquurtcrs ut
other pluccs would mcun the
disonfranchisemunt of thous-
ands- of qualified voer whose
duiiy “exposure to the presiden-
tlul campaign during September
would induce them to register."

Nonpurtisun groups pushing
registration as well us u hull-
dozun cullogt students were
represented by the Civil Liber-
tlos Union.

Urges

InvolvenLenI’

Vicki Gottlich

More student involvement in
student government was one of
the themes of Central Council’s
ﬁrst meeting.

The four standing committees
provided for in Central Council
rules, Athletic Advisory Board,
Finance Committee, Grievance
Committee, and Political and So-
cial Positions Committee, were
approved as standing committees
for this year. Also, a new com-
mittee was wtablishcd to review
appointments to University
Senate made by President
Benczet. The committee will not
actually l)(' a screening commit-
tee, but a means to get to know
the candidates.

Ad hoc committees were also
established. It is the wish of
Central Council and chairman
Kcn Stokem that these commit»
Lees serve the needs of the entire
student community. Any stu-
dent, and not necessarily a
member of Central Council, may
come before the Council with a
request to establish an Ad Hoc
committee. The committees
established so far are Student
Association Election Reform,
Campus Recreation Facilities.
and Publicity and Involvement
in Central Council and Student
Association. All students are in-
vited to participate on these
committees or any others that
Will lw formed.

In his presrdi-n"s report, Mike

    
  
   

,at Albany il making, ' plans} for
, impunity—University- Day
Saturday, Oct. 21, when the
university will hold open house
or raaidenta of the Capital Dia-
trict. Acitivitu for that day are
being planned in order to en-
hance the relationship between
SUNYA and its surrounding
community.

President Louis '1‘. Benezet sees
the program as a symbolic means
of strengthening the link
:between the university and its
public constituency. In a prac-
itical sense, Community-
University Day will allow the
public to visit the campus, to
inspect its physical plant, to
view its complex equipment, to
sample its program, and to talk
with rthusa who are involved in
the mission of the university
center.

Sorrell E. Chesin. assistant vice
president for university affairs,
heads the steering committee for
the day's events.

Said Dr. Chesin, “1 sec this day

lrsmpert presented a copy of
summary of the master plan for
the goals of the state university
system. A status report on
WSUA-FM was given lo each
council member to read before a
bill will be praentcd. Lampert
also spoke about a proposal
made last year by Sandy Lufti
for a seniority pro-registration
system. He believed that the bill
that will be introduced does not
agree with the proposal the
council approved last year.

A motion to approve Joel Lus-
tig Controller was passed by
council. The council, by the old
rules, had only the meeting after
the appointment was made to
veto that appointment.

In another move to aid stu-

and the Unireraiy. Already In
progre- are plans for exciting
exhibitions and displays, ﬁlmd
and lectures. recital: and drama-
tic offerings. There should be
something of interest at the
university for everyone."

He added that the students will
play a large part in C-U/da'y'a
activites. “They will be serving
as tour guides and information
guides, and will be involved in
various presentations throughout
the campus," he added. “ In
fact, we’re looking forward to a
gymnastic exhibition and a
modern dance program which
will have student participants.
We are excited, too, about some
of the unique and interesting
faculty presentations that are
being planned."

Four subcommittees have been
formed to assist the steering
committee with plans for the big
day.
dents, Council approved a bill
concerning due dates of stu-
dents' bills, introduced by Lam
pert. An ad hoc committee will
be established to look at the
whole process of billing, with
the purpose of giving students
more time to pay their bills.

Chairman Stokem introduced a
bill, also approved, to transfer
$500 from theiﬂnngency' Spand—
iing Line? to a Central Council
OperatinglEzpenseHr Refresh-
ements Line. The money will be
used for publicity and unex-
pected needs.

The lust bill, also introduced
by Stokcm, was an amendment
to the constitution calling for
more time to consider appoint-
merits.
