New York looks like its going
to be a critical state for George
McGovern. It is urban, it Is
industrial and not incidentally, it
commands forty-one electoral
votes-votes that need to be
chalked up in the Democratic
column on November 7th if
reformers’ idyllic political
dreams are to be translated into
victory come early winter.

 

There is probably another added
factor: Corning has always been
a loyal Democrat as well as a
realist; a strong party showing
will assure the victory of the
machine's own candidates.
Canim’l; aid has helped the
Senator but it has created prob.
lems as well. Albany is looked
"PO" as “the spotlight of the
nation" and the amlysis,~ “Cor.

“We assume the McGovern
supporters are a lot more prag-
matic than many might think
they are”, explains Brian Moss, 8
SUNYA student who is working
on the campaign. “We’re not

goes something like this: if the
McGovernites can forge a succes-
sful political coalition with the
regular Democrats and the coali-
tlon continues to be successful,
it will show people in the coun-
try that such political coalitions
can be built anywhere.

The McGovern people remain
conﬁdent but they are out to
capture the student vote be-

plained, "the student vote is
going to make a difference”.
There are several specific reasons
why this is so.

The co-operative venture has,
thus far, been rather successful.

moments in late summer when
the McGovern camp suffered a
few ripples of paranoia; a fear
that Mayor Coming and the

regulars might "sellout" and
undercut the ticket.

But that has changed now and
former New York City Mayor
Robert Wagner, who is heading
McGovern's statewide campaign
and has strong ties to the regu-
lars, is probably the biggest
reason why. He has helped ease
the feelings of trepidation and
now the relationship betWeen
the two camps is described as
“fairly cordial".

Where then, does this leave the
campaign? The McGovern
people, despite being outclassed
by the money, professionalism,
and expert political savvy of
Republicans like Rockefeller,
Javits, and Buckley remain op-
timistic.

The polls show McGovern
trailing nationally by over thirty
percent of the vote, but, youth-
ful supporters like Moss explain,
"we have a lot of confidence in
our pcrsuasiveness, our candi-
date, our own ticket and

Richard Nixon." The McGovern
people have been through the
pessimistic predictions before,
remembering all too well when
their candidate was polling two
and tree percent before his
strong showing in New Hamp-
shire. They are sure Nixon is
going to “blow it" before elec-
tion duy.

Mcuovernmltes s! r- the
McGovern/youth coalition as
mutually beneficial. “Listen”,
Moss explains, “if students and
young people make some kind
of impact in this campaign, they
will be regarded as an important
force in campaigns to come. If
we don’t pull it off with
McGovern, chances are our po-
litical power as young people
will decrease."

Meanwhile, they are doing the
canvassing, registration, organi-
zational work and leg-work from
which political victories are
built. They are making full
utilization of student hpr and
scouring the campus for more
voluntcvrs.

They all cheered loudly as he
entered the plushly appointed
Plantation Room at the Albany
Hyatt House. Sargent Shriver
was immediately surrounded by
about 20 admirers, all trying to
talk to him or shake his hand.
They were Albany‘s wealthy
Democrats. ML ny had paid $50 a
head just to ha\e the privilege of
being there.

Hi Ya, There!

Shriver answered their greet-
ings with a dcep‘throutcd, “Hi
ya, there," and “good to see ya,
glad you came."

Shriver stood on top of a chair

to address the gathering, shun-
ning the podium and micro«

phone, and speaking entirely

without notes.

Yalie Organized Affair

First he introduced the organ-

izer of the affair, is man by the
name of Hesburgh, who also

happened to be one of his Yale
classmates. Then, with formal-
ities over, he launched into his
campaign tirade
Nixon administration.

Only Poll that Counts...

“The only poll that really
counts“, he began, “ is the elec-
tion". Unlike McGovern, Shriver
is a political orator of the old
school, a man who speaks with
force and pounds the air with his
fists to add omphasis to his
words.

Looks, Acts, and Flies like a...

He told them that “We've got a
person who looks like a Presi-
dent, acts like a President, flies
around like a President, but
doesn't know where the ship of
stall- is going, he just rcucts."

and a weathervane: “Nixon
points to where the wind is
blowing. He’s a good politician."
And in a statement reminiscent
of one his late brother-in-Iaw
commonly used in the 1960
campaign, he said that what the
nation needs is some “inspira-
tion” and a “sense of direction."

All We Need is YOU

Shriver ended his brief, punchy
speech with: “Nixon may need
I'I'I‘, but all we need is YOU," a
line that brought spontaneous
cheers from the enthusiastic
supporters.

News of Hostages

Then someone passed him a
small, hand-written note, and 8
suddenly terse Shriver told the
audience that the remaining
Israeli hostages had been slain by
the Arab terrorists.

The mood of both Shriver and
the audience had been suddenly
transformed, and the now som-
licr Shriver delivered some
remarks about the events of the
day: “We might interrupt what
was going to be a very happy
occasion by remembering that as
long as we fail to practice here
and abroad the fundamental
principles of the JudetrChristian
ethic, the violencc in the world
will not cnd.”

A large number of those
gathered departed after Striver
had delivered these ﬁnal com-
ments.
