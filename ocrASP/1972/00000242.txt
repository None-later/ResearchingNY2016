By Bob Mayer

On Tuesday evening, Septem—
ber 5, shortly after 7 o'clock, in
huge Eastern Whisperjet carrying
Democratic Vice—Presidential
candidate R. Sargent Shriver lan-
ded and taxied to a stop at the
Page Airway Terminal. Waiting
there were some 2,000 enthu-
siastic McGovern-Shriver sup-
porters who came to hear the
man they hoped would replace
Spiro Agnew in November. The
aircraft, nicknamed “Lucky Se—
ven" came to a halt and, waiting
to greet Shriver was Mayor Cor-
ning and a host of other local
politicians. The crowd, who had
expected Shriver to appear at
6:30 had patiently waited for
this moment while being enter-

tained by the “Star-Spengler.
Washboard Band.” As Shriver
appeared, the crowd began
cheering and waving at the tall,
well-groomed candidate who af-
ter 13 hours of rugged cams
paigning still appeared fresh and
wide-awake.

Shriver moved up to the po-
dium after a short introduction
by Mary Anne Krupsak, candi-
date for state assembly. He deli-
vered an eloquent speech that
criticized the Nixon administra-
tions' record of the past four
years. He began by accusing the
president of fostering high un-
employment, increased inflation,
a rise in crime, an increased
federal deficit and mounting

 

welfare rolls. He pledged that
“after we take over the White
House in 1974, we're going to
take over the state house here in
Albany." He went on to say, “a
state like New York that has
produced men like Franklin
Roosevelt and Al Smith and
Herbert Lehman can do better
than Nelson Rockefeller." His
remarks drew loud applause.
The vice-presidential candidate
then mentioned Nixon's recent
Labor Day pronouncements on
the “work ethic" referring to the
GOP as a “no-ethic administra-
tion."Concluding the speech
with a plea to get supporters
involved in registration drives, he
told the audience, “Nixon may

need lTT but we need Y-O-U."

Sargent Shriver then moved to
the fence that separated him
from his exuberant audience for
a handshaking finale. Several stu-
dents in the crowd urged him to
visit Albany State. He then left
the airport for a meeting with
the local NAACP in Albany,
leaving a half hour traffic jam in
his wake.

There was no hint in the after-
noon rally of the confrontation
Shriver was to face later that
night, when over 150 students
from State marched peacefully
to the Hyatt House to face the
vice-presidential hopeful,

and to question his views of
the Olympic Village killings.

The Story

By Al Senia

You reach the penthouse of
Mohawk Tower by taking one of
the three elevators to the floor
directly below and walking up
the ﬁnal ﬂight of stairs, past the
unﬁnished carpentry and the
loose sawdust, the naked, hang-
ing light ﬁxtures, the scattered
tools and materials that suggest
incomplete construction work.

The penthouse is ﬁnished now
even to the point of carpeting.
Only the furniture still is mis-
sing. If you stand against the
long row of barren windows on a
clear day and look downtown,
you will see as far as the twin
towers of the South Mall pro-
ject. and beyond.

It is the view from the opprr
site side that is somewhat more
revealing. From there, you can
see virtually the entire SUNYA
campus. And if you crane your
neck slightly, you might even
notice the second ﬂoor of the
administration building where
SUNYA President Louis '1‘.
Benezet and his vice—presidents
spend their working day. It is a
rather ironic view. For it is on
that very floor that those very
men decided the fate of Mohawk
Tower early this past summer.
The ramiﬁcations of that deci-
sion are just beginning to be felt
now in several varied ways.

You might ﬁrst notice the ra—
miﬁcations in the hesitancy of

Behind the Tower

student government leaders to
trust Benezet and his administra-
tors to the extent they did one
year ago at this time. They speak
of him in different tones now.

You might notice the mults in
the crowded quarters student
association groups share in the
Campus Center. They have come
to increasingly blame Benezet
for their discomfort.

But probably you see the rami-
ﬁcations of Benezet's decision
most clearly by simply counting
the number of student faces in
Mohawk Tower. There aren't
any.

For the story of how Mohawk
Tower underwent a transforma-
tion from a dormitory to an
academic ofﬁce complex is not
as simple as one might expect.
Call it a study in institutional
bureaucracy, university priorities
or possibly, administrative indif-
ference, for it is all of these and
more. It is a lesson in student
impotence, an examination of
their lowly status at State.

Vacant Space

Originally, Mohawk Tower was
to open this academic year as
SUNYA's newest dormitory,
home for several hundred stu-
dent residents on the newest of
the four quadrangles, Indian.
But underutilization of dorm
space at SUNYA changed all
that. Eleven percent of Albany
State's dormitories were vacant
last year, reflecting a trend
throughout the entire SUNY
system. Statewide, some 5,000
bed spaces were left empty or
converted to other uses.

That situation was a cause for
concern to SUNY ofﬁcials here
in Albany because empty beds
mean less student rents and al-
timately, less money to pay off
bonds ﬂoated by the State Dor—
mitory Authority to pay for
dormitory construction.

Allowing Mohawk to be used
as a dormitory this year—which
almost certainly would have
meant opening an empty tower
at the university-~would ob~
viously not sit well either from a
public relations or an internal
university standpoint.

The sad fact was that poor
planning had left the university
with a tower it had no use for, a
rather gargantuan white ele-
phant.

So il was decided to negotiate

with the Dormitory Authority
to see if the tower space might
be used for other purposes. The
negotiations were lengthy, com-
plex, and secret. Whilu they Were
occurring, student representa-
tives met with various admini-
strators in an attempt to receive
space allocations in the tower
and relicVe overcrowded condi-
tions in the Campus Center.

Space Dispute

As spring approached, it
seemed a dispute was developing
over who would receive the an-
ticipated floor space; it would
either be given over to student
oriented services, academic de—
partments, or a combination of
the two.

Student representatives were
told by lower level administra-
tors thut once final negotiations
