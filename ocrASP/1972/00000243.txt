 FM V‘ Proposal ’ Wins Council StIPP0"

by Ellyn Sternberger

Last Thursday night, Central
Council approved some appoint-
ments, reversed a decision of last
year's council, and resoundly de-
feated one of President Lam-
pert’s bills.

The meeting begsn'with a very
standard procedure of approving
the appointed members of this
year's Finance Committee. The
names were presented by chair-
men Steve Gerber and despite
some question of a possible re-
signation of a Council member,
the appointments were quickly
approved.

The next order of business was
a discussion of the new parking
regulations. Each Councilman
was asked to look at his map of
the campus as Vice Chairman
Pat Curran discussed the many
confusing new regulations. Cur-
ran and Chairman Keri Stokem

had just come from a meeting
with the head of security, Jim
Williams. There was a long dis-
cussion about the new regula-
tions, in which President Lam-
pert told the Council that the
mica were stricter than those
agreed to at a "mythical" meet—
ing between student representa-

I, osm

tives and security last spring.
Lampert questioned the legality
of the rules and the discussion
ended when the Council decided
to delay discussion until next
Week, when Williams and Jack
Hartley mtld be invited to
speak and an ad hoc committee
would be established to investi-
gate the question.

duced as the President’s appoint.
merit for the position of
Assistant Coordinator for Politi-

conducted.

A motion was presented to ask
the Administration to suspend
classes on election day so that
the newly enfranchised students
and in general the University
Community in general could
take part in the Presidential elec-
tion. When President Lampert
indicated that Chancellor Boyer
already let SUNY schools know
ofhis disapproval of such action,
the motion was amended. The
final wording of the motion
(which was passed unanimously
and recorded as a white ballot)
urged President Benezet to ask

The next motion was intro-

concerned the campus-affilitated

presentation about the center
and the President of the Center

tions. The bill was passed and
reversed a decision of last year's

Tips from the Top:
A Councilman Speaks

By Patrick Curran
Vicc~Chairman, Central Council

Why would anybody want to get involved in
student government? Why should a student even
believe that the Student Association can make
things happen? And whilc we're asking question:
What's a Central Council, and where is that thirty
dollars per semester mandatory activity fcc going?

Central Council, the legislativa body of the stu-
dent government here at SUNYA, is feeling very
self-conscious this year. The members realize they
havo a difficult job before them, and are fully aware
of the effect they can have on this university
community. But Council folk dll‘ not blind to the
fact that. their schoolmates cxpcct littli- of them,

this wide-spread altitude, this year’s Central Council

Parking tickets will no longer
be a joke under the proposed
parking guidelines prepared by
the Security. Office. The traffic
and parking control program has
been changed since last year and
put under thc authority of a new
Assistant Director of Security,
Karl Scharl.

The program has been in prep-
aralion since last spring when
two changes in the Education
Law were passed by the legisla-
ture. The low establishes that the
same traffic rules and regulations
apply to the campus as to any
city. And Sccurity officers now
have the full power of police
officers in the actual perform-
ance of official duties. This
means that all tickets administer-
ed by Security will have to bc
paid. Students who do not pay
their fines can have thcir trail-
scripts and degrees withheld.
Faculty and staff can have their
fines deducted from their .szil
dries.

Basically, Security says tough-
cr r-viforcemcnl will bc the major
difference from lost your, 'I'hi-
regulations fur the coming year
have only a few significant
changes. Security also has a tow
truck at thcir disposal this your--
and tbcy will use it. Sim-v last
January, 200 cars have I)CI,‘II
towed away.

In an intcrvicw, Scharl empha-
sized that the new regulations

Proposals for building a new
lot will not be Scharl’s worry.
His office does not have funds
for building parking lots. Scharl
has enough of a problem, any-
way, in trying to solve the park-
ing problem tut has, thus far,
defied solution.

 

The new parking regulation:-
scheduled to go into effect Sept
ember 18 will probably be delay
ed, according to Mike Lampert.
Student Association President
The University Council (the
board of trustees for Albany
State), which must approve the
regulations, acted Friday to del~
ay their enactment. The Council
encouraged campus governing
bodies to examine the regula-
tions and submit comments to
vice-president Hartley during the
next two weeks. -.

The University Council acte
after its chairman, J. Vanderbilt
Struub, received a letter from
Lampert, criticizing the lack of
student and faculty input into
the development of the parking
rcgulations. This year's regula-
tions, availablc around the cam-
pus, include some significant
changes. Cars are to be registered
yearly for a fch dollar fee and
assigned to particular lots. Park-
ing fines are to be five dollars, in
place of the graduated scale of
fines used last year, a change to
which Lampert objects.

Ccntral Council and University
Community Council, an advisory
group, will meet next Thursday.
These groups and the executive
committee of the Senate are
expected to discuss the regula-
tions.

consultations, says the vice--
presidents were aware of the
crowded conditions in thc Cam-
pus Center and that a “wide
variety of potential uses were
discussed.” While some discus—
sion took placc on the possibi-
lity of moving studcnl groups
ovr-r to thc tuwcr, Wclch says
that no specific case for any one
group was made.

Sour Taste

But tlic i-xplunatioiis ItaVc left
a sour tnch in the mouths of
some students who werc in-
volvn-d in the discussions. Lam—
pcrt says he is unable to under-
stand how Benezct could have
remained ignorant of student de-
SIFL’S for space in Mohawk ’I‘o-
wcr. Lampert points of a con—
fidential memorandum he sent
to Bcnczct on May 30th as one
specific instance of the men-
tioning of thi- need for mori-
space. The memo says In part: “I
am sure you (Bent-act) can un-
derstand that I, too, have vested
interests in space. Student
groups could use more office
