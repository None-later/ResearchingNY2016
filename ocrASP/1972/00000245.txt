ALBANY STUDENT‘PRESS

The [Great ‘
Rip-of ‘

Some called it the greatest student rip-off this universit
had ever seen. Others were only mildly surprised. ()rrc AS
editor, on campus during the summer, commented: “The
really pulled a fast one this time."

“They” refers to SUNYA President Louis Benczct and hi
administrative subordinates. And the “fast one” refers i
Mohawk Tower, the white stone structure that dominate -
lndian Quad. A tower which, as our news pages not
today, has opened this year with no students inside of it

What scents most significant about this decision was the
complete lack of direct student involvement and the
credibility gap that was created not only by the actions o
Benezet, but by his vice-presidents as well.

Throughout last year. interested parties were continually
assured that no decision had been made on what was to be
done with Mohawk. Student Association President Mike
Lampert came away with a personal assurance from
Bcnczct that he would be consulted before a decision
would be made.

The promised consultations never occurred. Rather, the
decisions were made when most students had gone llttlttt‘
for the summer, ASP and WSUA ceased functioning, and
Larnpcrt was interning in SUNY’s Washington, D.(.‘. officc.

Only then could students learn that there was absolutely
no roorn in that twenty story tower for student needs or
serviccsuan interesting fact since it was they the budding
was originally constructed to serve.

Sirrcc assuming office, President Bencch has prltlt'tl
himself on building a university

“community” and. re
fleeting that notion. administrators have often called on
students to place partisan interests aside “for the good ol
the whole."

Concert Board
Urges Participation

To the SUNYA Community.

As we all start a new academic
year, University Concert Board
is in the midst of planning an-
other year of concerts. This year
the Board is making a special
effort to get your feedback-
your opinions, your complaints,
your satisfaction. Most. of this
campus does not understand the
set-backs we are up against-mot
purely through their own fault,
but. through the fault of a lack
of communication. No—-we are
not. a group of people sitting in
the Campus Center deciding who
we would like to see here.
Rather, we are a frustrated
group of students trying to cope
with inﬂated prices, small and
accoustically poor concert
facilities, and largely varied
musical tastes on this campus.

Our program is funded by
student tax-~your money. Un-
fortunately the money does not
go as far as we would like it. to
go. First. of all, as everyone pays
student tax, we have a
responsibility to satisfy as many
musical interests as possible. It's
just. not fair to concentrate
purely on large rock acts. We
must ﬁt in our folk, jazz, black
and contemporary music also.

The Concert Board is well
aware of the fact that the largest
musical interest. on this campus
is rock, however. Unfortunately,
all those groups you would like
to have here are those with
ridiculously high prices. A
supergroup will automatically go
to a school or ball with a larger
budget. Also, our facilities are
not. large enough to seat. many

people; therefore, ticket. sales do
not provide adequate funds for
the cost of entertainment. We
have always believed that. since
you have already spent a large
sum on mandatory-tax, we have
an obligation to keep ticket
prices down. This can be
changed if there is a genuine
feeling shown on this campus
that students will pay more to
see a superstar here.

The University Concert. Board
is distributing questionnaires on
Tuesday and Wednesday on
dinner lines and in the Campus
Center on the subject of con-
certs. Please-answer honestly.
It‘s easy enough to say on
paper-yes. 1 will spend $5.00 to
see E, L & P, Clapton, or the
Allmans; but, when the time
comes and the wallet is thin, will
this really be the case? Also,
when asked who you would like
to see here, don't slap down the
biggest name you know-your
overpriced, Wealthy idol of the
past. four years. Think of the
drawbacks we face and of the
other muscial interests of this
campus. Please be sincere, but
sensible. We are striving to hear
from all the students here, not.
just our friends or the people
who have nothing but com-
plaints based on their misunder-
standing of our set-backs and
responsibilities. We welcome any
comments or suggestions
throughout the year and we
promise a great year only if we
have your feedback, cooperation
and understanding.

Sincerely.

All God’s
Children
Cheated

To the Editor:

Having recently been finan-
cially raped at. the bookstore
during the semi-annual textbook
purchasing ritual, I noticed the
mammoth sign declaring that.
textbook prices established by
the publisher are used nation-
wide.

Rather than being selectively
cheated at. Albany, it. appears
that students in our dear coun-
try are now being universally
cheated.

The good people at John Wiley
sent me their catalog last month
from which I have already pur-
chased a single text. However,
yesterday I paid $15.75 plus tax
at the bookstore for a computer
science book by Borko. On page
244 of the catalog I could have
mailed away and had it indivi-
dually wrapped and delivered to
me for a mere $14.50 (i.e., 8%
lens). I doubtthat this represents
the exception.

One might guess that buying in
quantity reduces pricey Guess
again.

Respectfully.
Anthony Paoune

The Children of the Tube

“I Dreamt Lucille Ball was my Mother"

by Rick Mitz

My mother spent. so much time
at. PTA meetings and other con—
cerned parent organizations, that.
I grew up thinking Lucille Ball
was my mother.

While Mom was taking courses
in Doc Spock l and Joyce
Brother's ll, Lucy was there.
After a tough day at. public
school I’d turn on with Lucy,
my surrogate mother, who never
let me down except. once when
the tube blew.

it's bad its toll. i went. straight
to the couch when Lucy and
Desr got divorcnd. And I was a
ward of CBS when they took her
show off the air.

Dr. l‘rt'udt'nfeldt. and l had
long sessions about it.

"What. comes to your mind
when you think about. your
mother?"

“Half an hour a day, five times
a week. Including re-runs." And
it wasn't. much different for the
other kids on the block. Manny
Wineland, whose mother spent
her time selling door-to-door
salve, chose a substitute mother
whose show was taken off the
air. Manny had a nervous
breakdown at age 7. Imagine the
trauma of having your mother
cancelled after 13 weeks.

The whole neighborhood lived
vicariously through TV. Mary Jo
Maddock had a dog named
Lassie. Alex Tubline had a horse
named Fury. Pamela Gibson had
an uncle named Ed who Look
in?! to the circus every Sunday
night. She recently went into
mourning when they cancelled
him after 20 years.

We used to get. lost. in space
and say Howdy to Doody. We
had a father who know best, had
a maid named Hazel and took all
of our pediatric problems to the
doctor of our choicev-Bcn Casey
or James KildarP. Where are they
now?

We watched hundreds of
mothers-not. unlike our own,
real or televised" pour out. their
breaking hearts to all of the USA
on Queen For A Day. We'd
comb out With Kooky. the pre-
IiontJtl snxsymbol with hair.
We'd watch December Bride, the
grandmother of us all with lav-
under hair. And we'd chit cliu
and rltumba into the hearts of
America right. along wtt.h Kath-
t'rint' and Arthur Murray's magic
steps. We learned to rebut“
"Mother, pit-use, I'd rather do it.
myself." Arid We did it ourselvus.

WI' coiiti-iriplutod life with
profoundly meaningful qut'ts‘~
tioris like, "Suzie, why did you
leaVe Jimmy‘s bike in the
driveway?"

And we didn't need sex odu-
cuLion back in the {10's. We had
the Mickey Mouse Club Mous-
koteum, when.- a whole genera-
tion looked on when Annette
reached puberty, which is some-
thing none of its will ever forget.
including Annette.

Today's generation of children
of the tube have it. much worse.
Imagine some kid who has
Archie Bunker as his substitute
father.

"Hi, daddy."

"Stii‘le yourself, meathead.”

And then there’s the prime
time identity crisis.

“i just can’t get used to Mary
Tyler Moore being single after all
those years that. she was married
to Dick Van Dyke,” a con-
temporary said recently. “The
Chutzpah of Dick Van Dyke to
run off to Arizona with Hope
Lang and then flaunt it. on
Saturday nights-only sixty
seconds after Mary signs off. I
shall never forgive him."

But my heart still belongs to
Lucy. I can't relate in any
meaningful way to the new,
single, independent Lucy with
two grown kids--maybe it's sib-
ling rivalry--but. i wouldn’t. miss
the reruns of the old Lucy show
for a visit home. Everyday at
3:15, i hop downtown to the
department store of my choice
and tell the salesman that. I'm
interested in buying a TV. And
for the thirty minutes it's back
to the womb via a TV set.

But. I'Ve run into problems.
Recently l encountered a kid.
my own age, waiting in appl-
iances for Donna Reed to begin
--at llll' same time Lucy was to
begin.

“I want to watch Donna

d," be said. “And 1 got hurt-

handlr- this like maturi- adults.
My Lucy is better than your
Donna. Nuhhh!"

“Oh. yeah? WI'“ at least Donna
never got divorced."

"No. Just cancelled."

He pulled the plug out of the
TV set anti run off. “I'm gonna
tell the salesman on you," he
jirored. And the salesman came
over to mediate and plug the set
back in.

Some people just can’t. seem to
cut the cord.
