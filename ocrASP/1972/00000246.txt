Faculty Student Association, the all-inelmive corporation that
provides essential services for the SUNYA student, remains virtually
an unknown entity in the eyes of most resident and non~resident
‘ “‘ ‘ alike. Few students realize that the food they eat, the
books they buy, the card shop, the billiard room and bowling alley
they patronize (to mention just a few) are all services proyided by

We present this very brief introduction to the corporation in the
hope that it will better acquaint students with its various sub-

divisions. Much of this material was compiled by J. Stephen Flavin,
an ASP reporter who has specialized in coverage of Faculty Student
Association for the past several semesters.

Originally, the material was to be distributed to all students as a
brochure, but problems with composition, finances, and distri'
bution, along with a laissez-l'iare attitude by the management, has
seemingly resulted in the scrapping of the project.

And so, we present this oVervicw of lt‘SA, the campus corporate
monopoly. ignored by some, liked or despised by others, its
existence is mandated by state law. And that means no matter what,
you may think of it, it is here to stay.

pansion of the stationery and
school supplies, and has recently
opened up a separate card shop
across the hall from the main

store.

The bookstore management
has been under strong pressure
to move the operation “out of
the red.” Inventory Shrinkage
(items marked down, stolen, or
outdated) accounted for
$60,000 to $80,000 this year
and last. Bookstore managerial
errors and a lack of space have
attributed to another $80,000 to
$100,000 in losses for the last
two years. Corrective measures
undertaken by the new manage-
ment include hiring of security
personnel and a rudimentary in-
ventory control system.

FSA operaties a multitude of vending machines on campus, including nearly 50 Pepsi and a few Coke

machines.
