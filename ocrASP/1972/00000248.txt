i don't know whether we’re
making sortie sort of history for
the Albany area or not, but 'Joel

'Cha'dabe's Free Music Store
seems destined to become one of
those venerable institutions
which make good music schools
peat. if only the UniVersity
Community knew of what was
taking place in their own back-
yard! Maybe there would be less

1 talk of “dead weekends."

Friday’s concert was no excep-
tion to what seems to be an
unwritten rule: FMS Concerts
must be interesting....intriguing
to the point that listeners would
want to return. In actuality,
most of the concertgoers are
puzzled. They are being exposed
to a new form of music, a music
that has yet to_be categorized
into oblivion. it is spontaneous,
or soit seems. And it uses all the
facilities that Beethoven would
have had his audiences use—not
just the ears.

And to prove a point, the FMS
usually has a sight-and-sound
piece, one with lights, or movies,
or something to distract one’s
eyes from the performers them-
selves. The philosophy is that
watching the performers has ve-
ry little to do with the music
itself—a partial explanation for
the fact that while modern mu-
sic does fairly well on record,
concerts of it are rather rare. At
any rate, it was hard to ignore
the running, hopping, and frene-
tic activity of lean-Charles Fran-
cois, the guest percussionist en
route from Paris to San Diego.
His piece (pieces eventees/ for
guitar and percussion was a mix-
ture of pensive, slow moving
sounds, wild, sharply contrasting
noises, and a bit of visual slap-
stick. All in all, it was good for
about l0 minutes of really en-
grossing music and a laugh or

two. ‘lhat should be enough to
please the cynics, although the
super-cynics in the audience re-
rmined unconvinced.

Any further discussion of the
music on the program (a piece
for bass trombone 8r. tape, a
piece for ﬁlm, electronics, &
trombone, and Chadabe’s
Echoes for giitar,trorrbme per-
cussion, & electronics) is, i
think, secondary to its mison
d'erre. Electronic music is the
music of an era, much as recor-
der consorts and string quartets
hail from the 16th, l7th, and
l8th centuries. The mere fact
that few people bother to listen
to it does not distract from its

' importance. Everyone knows the

old “Beethoven must be a raving
maniac to write like that" sto
ries; tales of reviewer‘s disgust
throughout the ages. After a
while, though, what the review-
ers say becomes lost in time,
while the music itself retains all
the timelessness that is art. That
is also an old story, but it is
always ignored in the face of a
few very stubborn people’s egos.
Personal taste, and the pride we
all love in our own tastes, is a
tough nut to swallow.

It would be detrimental to the
cause to say that one should go
out and see the Free Music Store

because it is educational. No one
would go. Electronic music is -
entertainment, and if you are
not entertained, there must be a
reason. if you can ﬁnd the rea-
son, analyze it, and you might
be able to enjoy more of what
should prOVe to be the way of
the future.

 

 

cocktail Plays

The first of “The-Second-
Monday-And-Tuesday-of-the-
Month-At-Four-O’clock" con-
certs with Findlay Cockrell,
pianist, will be held in the
Recital Hall of the Performing
Arts Center, State University of
New York at Albany, September
ii and I2. The publicis invited
at no charge.

Mr. Cockrell has selected for
his first program “Paganini
Variations by Liszt and
Brahms." It is an introduction to
a forthcoming concert he will
play with the Albany Symphony
Orchestra, which will feature
Rachmaninoff’s “Rhapsody on a
Theme of Paganini" for piano
and orchestra.

Next month's “Four-O'Clock"
concerts (October 9 and to) will
be a performance of the Rach-
maninoff "Rhapsody" with the
second piano substituting for the
orchestra.

 

 

Sarato'go Center:
8.5. 8. T. Perform

By Bill Brina

Don Cooper, 3 pleasnat, mel-
low performer gave Friday nite’s
Blood, Sweat & Tears perfor-
mance at Saratoga a promising
start. For their ﬁrst two or three
numbers—taken from their new
singer’s (Jerry Fisher) repetoire,
the “new” B,S, & T sustained
that promise. Fisher’s voice is
strong enough to cut through
the horns without straining and
his own material cooks. “The
Crow‘s Funeral," performed in
Swedish by Swedish lead guitar
player George Wadenius, wasn't
too impressive in its own right
but the horn fanfare intro-
duction was stunning-4t mana-
ged to summon the spirit of
atonal serialism without actually
being atonal.

But then the band launched
into Dylan's “Down By the
Flood" and this writer's hopes
fell apart. The plodding, heavy~
handed arrangement epitomized
the worst of the“old" B,S, &
T---dragging tempos, a Joe—
Cocker-caught-in-mo-
lasscs-stagger-aroundby singer
Fisher; those we've—heard-thcm--

a-thousand-times-before canned
B,S, & T horn riffs. From there
on in it was all downhill: some
blasts from the past, the new
band sounding exactly like a
recording of the old: a lifeless
rendition of “M for Melissa"
from Steve Katz (who was pret-
ty lifeless all night, in fact) and a
tour-de-faree of Carol King’s
“Snow Child"---everyone Soloed
on everything, except possibly
the block ﬂute, every solo was
pedestrian to an extreme severe
even for pop, none of them were
connected in anv wav to any of
the others, and the whole god-—
awful thing was interminany
long-«felt like two hours, at
least.

The "new" band seems almost
as lost and without direction as
the last edition did. They might
do themselves and us a favor
were they to bury B,S, & T for
good and seek some more crea-
tive environments. Given the
dollar-drawing power of that
name, though, it seems a safe bet
that that will never happen.

like Peter's just-released solo LP,
Winds of Change, they should
be good. Mahavtshnu follows
and there can be little doubt
they will not be merely good—-
-they will be excellent. if you
have not yet heard them in
