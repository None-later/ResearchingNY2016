It's now less than two weeks
before the Albany Football team
embarks on their last year of
club football as in 1973 the
team moves to varsity status.
The puzzle still continues as to
who will bathe top signal caller
with three meh battling it out.

Last year Coach Ford and his 

staff, realizing that starter Bill
Flanagan was graduating and
Rick Petty was not returning,
looked elsewhere for a replace-
ment. They decided to pick the
best athlete and convert him
into a quarterback. The staff
looked toward Jeff O'Donnell,
who was a starter in the defen-
sive secondary. O'Donnell is
quite a natural athlete but has
never played the position and
has lots to learn.

Gordy Kupperstcin has had
some experience playing quarter-
back sparingly twa years ago.
Assistant Coach Ray Murphy re—
rmrked, “Gordy is the best all
around of the three." Working
against Kupperstein is his height
at only 5-6 and weight of 160
pounds. One wonders if he can

take 'the pounding of a full

season. 4

The other candidate for the
job. is John Bertuzzi,’ who is
tabbed as the quarterback of the
future; John is the best passer of
the trio. He, however, must
make the big adjustment from
his high school offense to the
more complicated Albany of-

,fense. The edge right now at

quarterback must go to O’Don-
nell.

Albany will have to count
heavily on its ground attack.
Sophomores Lonnie Davis and
Carvin Payne lead the rushers.
Davis right now is nursing a bad
shoulder but will be ready for
the scrimrmge against Hamilton
College. Backing up the starters
are freshman Marvin Perry and
Noel Walker.

With the graduation of Cleve
Little the pass catchers lack a
deep threat. The leading candi-
date for split end is freshman
Bob Baxter. He's got good speed
and a tremendous pair of hands.
At tight and veteran Ed Perka
returns. Perka is a fine blocker
and also doubles as the Mum's
punter.

Albany 9 Wins

by Rich Yanku

Make room Cincinnati, Make
room Pittsburgh, here comes the
Great Dane Machine. Pittsburgh
and Cincy lead in batting average
with a ,270 mark in the majors,
however after Saturday's double—
header victory over the Utica
Pioneers, the Great Dane‘s bat-
ting average is .34 3.

The Albany State Varsity Buse-
ball Team banged out 24 hits in
the doubleheader and won by
scores of 11-5 and l0—9. Both
games went one inning over theI
regulation play with State com-

'ng from behind to win the first
on a big six-run seventh inning.
Ruy Angrilla smacked four sin-
gles in the first contest and
drovo in three runs, two of them
coming in the big eighth. ’l‘erry
Kenny and Dan DeForest each
tallied two hits & two RBl's and
Dave Bentley stroked a triple
and single. Kevin Quinn pitched
well, winding up with a comv
plete game, striking out six and
walking nine. He threw only 79
pitches as compared to 16.")
thrown by the opposing pitcher.

The offensive line is led by
co-captain Kleon Andreadis at
guard and Hudson Valley trans-
fer Bill Adams at tackle. Adams
was switched from TE because
the coaches felt that his talents
would be Wasted backing up

started where they left off in the
ﬁrst game. SUNYA scored three
quick runs in the first inning on
a hit and run double by Jack
Leahy, scoring Terry Kenny and
run scoring singles by Bill Lapp
and Ray Angrilla. However, just
as Albany rallied in the first
game, Utica chopped State's lead
to nothing in their last half of
the scvonth. Ken LaRoe started
for the Danes in the second
game and Coach Burlingame was
hopeful that Kenny would last
ﬁve innings. But Kenny, ham-
pered by pulled ham-string mus-
clcs in both legs, had to be
pulled out in the fourth inning
after giving up a three-run homer
which cut the Danes lead to 7-4.

defense must keep the oppo-

The big guns on the line for the
Danes are tackles Frank Villa-
nova and Jim "I‘iny' Holloway.
It will be their job to put pres-
sure on the opposition's quar-
terback. Veteran Vinnie Pierce
will be at one end and Ron
Gardner will probably be at the
other. Returning to football
after a year’s absence is Rudy
Vido. Rudy will backup the line.

Co-captain Arnie Will returns
as a starting line backer and will
be joined by sophomore Don
Mion. At cornerback the leading
choices are Carl Jones and Bill
Hamilton. The secondary lead
by Vic Giulianeli safety John
Johnson and Bruce Cummings.

Albany must look to the fu-
ture. There are only seven
seniors on a team of 63, 27 of
which are freshmen. This year
will have to be a season in which
the team gains the much needed
experience. Realistically a .500
season is doubtful, However, big
things can be expected for the
first year of varsity ball in '73.

The Olympic Force

by Bill Heller

lescurcd by the "political"
holocaust of mass murder last
week, lies a deep rooted problem
that might make this Olympics
the biggest farce the sports
world has ever seen. Threatening
to steal the simple beauty of
competition and sport, the all
purpose Olympic bureaucracy
seems content to add travesty
upon travesty. The ﬁnal disaster,
built upon a pyramid of bad
decisions, mental lapses, and
outright misuse of authority,
was the basketball ﬁnal between
the United States and Russia.

l’u tting their spotless record on
the line, the Americans waged a

US. team back onto the court,
the scurekecper insisted that
there should have been three
seconds left when the Russians
took the ball out. The clock was
reset at three. it should have
been set at two if anything,
because the Russians had already
used one second. In a ﬁtting
ending, they scored the winning
basket at the buzzer.

Since then there have been howls
of protest and rage from the
U.S., none of which changed the
result of the game. Kevin Joyce,
who had been the catalyst in the
U.S. comeback surge with key
outside baskets, put it bluntly,
"They‘ve been out to get the
US. all along. Well now they've
done it." Is this true?

There is evidence to support it.
Hadn't U.S. boxer Reggie Jones

resulted in the subsequent ﬁring

Wayne Collette and Vince

TUESDAY. SEPTEMBER 12, 1972

 

 

 

by Mike lgoe

The Albany State football
withing staff was appropriately
Md for last Saturday’s pre-
geuou clash with RPl. _

Clad in deep purple jerseys,
Bob Ford and his assistants pro-
vided more than enough sugges-
tion of mourning as R?! wal-
loped Albany 28-6.

For the Danes it was largely a

.tory of being outclassed in
every department of the statis-
iiacolumns.

lil’l coach Dick Riendeau had
been looking for a quarterback
but has apparently found his
mm in Brent Rupp. Rupp's ac-
curate passing overcame several
fourth down and third down and
long yardage situations for the
Engineers

The Albany squad didn’t make
may mistakes but these errors
accounted for three RPI touch-
down. Ed Perka’s knee hit the
ground on a panting attempt
and the ball was called back to

the 24. Four plays later the
Engineers capitalized.

A fumble on the 22 and a few
missed tackles on another play
helped to widen the point
spread.

However, a few facts should be
noted about the nature of the
game.

Riendeau's game plan was con-
siderably more stable with most
of his team back from last year.
Also, the RPl mentor didn't frec-
ly substitute for some time.

By contrast, Couch Ford tried
out many different combina‘
tions of players throughout the
game. In addition, Albany had
three quarterbacks to look at in
a game situation as compared to
RPl’s two. Whenever the Danes
posed a scoring threat, liiendeau
immediately returned to his
starting defense.

It was Ford‘s substitutions,
though, which may have
answered some questions about
the coming season.

‘ertuzzi Looks Good;
Danes Crushed 8-6 ' 4'

John Bertuzzi, who reportedly
wasn’t much of a scrambler, ran
for State‘s lone touchdown and
moved the team the best of the
three quarterbacks. Bertuzzi
may have landed the number
one quarterback spot.

Another good performance
was turned in by Marvin Perry.
Perry ran four kickoff returns
back for a total of 58 yards. In
fact, had it not been for a missed
block, Perry might have taken
one return all the way for a
touchdown.

in the receiving department,
Bob Baxter had thc sure hands.
Baxter grabbed two passes for
ITK yards.

Thus, the big word now for
Albany is work. Hopefully, the
practices leading up to the Sep-
tember 23 season opener wili be
marked by the emergence of
more individuals who can help
the (in-at Danes put together a
Winning campaign in 1972.

Runners Rounding

Into Form

by Kenneth Arduinn

(Tun a tcam lUb’t' its top runner
and slill have n In-llr-r team than
last year" This is Lhc question
thi- Albany i'mssi'uiinlry team
Will lry in answer, and after
talking to coach Bob Mliiim'y the
answer is an optimistic yl-s

Last year Brian Quinn was far
in front as the top runner for the
Danes With I4 wnis This year
Brian has lrnnsfcrcd but Coach
Munsi-y is not worried. lf trans-
fer Vinnie itcda can shake his
foot injury he will probably be
the favorite to take over the No.
1 spot.

 

ltr-turnees Bob Elias and Scott
Ahercrombic and transfer Jim
Sliradcr are off to slow starts
and can use sonii- work. The
hope is they Will he in top form
by mid-season.

'l‘hc freshman sensation of the
prc-scason is ()arlo Clicrubilio,
an Albany boy Carlo finished
ninth out of 207 in a scrimage
on Labor Day llis time for that
race was better than Quinn’s
time when he won this race last
year. Carlos is expected to chal-
lenge Reda for the No. 1 spot.

John Stanton and Paul De-
Marco are returning from in-
juries which kcpt them out most
of last season, Pro-season work-
outs shows that both men
should be ready for the season.

Two other freshmen have im-
pressed Coaeh Munsey and their
Albany future looks bright. Both
Leo Smith and Phil Doyle are
making a rush at making the
varsity and they will give Albany
their best in the future. The
future is also bright because only
Abercrombie and Stanton are
seniors.

Overall the Albany team has
depth, especially in the top
spots. Last year Albany found
itself outmanned in these spots
and it cost Albany a victory
against Colgate. This should be
no problem this year.

One major disappointment is
that Brockport has cancelled out
of the meet on September l6.
Couch Munsey is willing to take
on anyone just to get some
(‘iinlpt’tlllUn before two tough
succssivc inatchcs. Last year
Montcliiir State bcut Albany for
thc first time by only two points
and the barriers want to avenge
that defeat. One week later Al-
biiny takes on its toughest op-
ponent, the Army, for the first
time. These two meets will show
how good the team really is.
