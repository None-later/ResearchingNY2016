“A ph stool education requirement sill remains the only general
undurgraduote requirement at SUNYA."

~I'UESDA‘Y, SEPTEMBER 12, 1972

New Phys

Despite the fact that nobody
wants it, a physical education
requirement still remains the
only general undergraduate re-
quirement at SUNYA due to a
policy of the State University
Trustees.

The State University Trustees’s
policy, which "was adopted on
November 9, 1967, was con-
.cerned with governing the
conduct of physical education
programs at the State University
of New York. The policy stated,
“lt'shali be the policy of the
State University of New York
that all regular undergraduate
students of the State University
must complete a physical edu-
cation program satisfactory to
the Chancellor of the Univer-
sity.”

As a result of this policy, the
Faculty Senate on March 18,
1968 issued a revised physical
education plan which reaffirmed
the physical education require-
ment. The policy stated that
each undergraduate student
should fulfill a four unit or two
year requirement in physical
education over and above the
hour requirements for gradu-
ation. The plan called for a
revision of the program in
September, 1972.

in October, 1971, the Senate
defeated a new revised physical
education program that had
passed the Curriculum Com—
mittee and the Undergraduate
Academic Council unanimously.
This left the old physical edu—
cation progrum still in effect.

The defeated plan had called

for the granting of credit for
physical education courses
within the hours required for
graduation. The Physical Edu-
cation Department had urged
that the learning experiences in
the required courses warranted
the earning of degree credit, and
that the students attitude
toward physical chcation
would be improved by the
granting of credit.

As to the requirement, the
Physical Education Department
felt that physical education
should still continue us a re-
quirement duc to the fact that
Albany's admission requirements
are nof based on selecting
students with basic under-
standings and skills in physical
education and the fact that
physical education contributes
to the present and future phy-
sical and mental health of the
individual 'l‘ln- consensus against
tlltt ri-vnnon plan was that [110
faculty opposed the crodit whilc
thc students opposed the rte
quircmcnts.

At the end of the 1071-72
academic year, the Under»
graduate Academic Council and
the Senate took more action
concerning the physical educu»

gtion requirement. The action

was taken on u bill proposed by
Mike Lamport, Presidnnt of
Student Association.

The ﬁnal version of Lampert's
bill, which passed in the Senate,
proposed that the unit concept
for physical ’ " be
changed to credit which would
be counted within the credits
required for graduation. The
maximum credit allowed in
physical education for courses
below the 300 level to be
counted‘ towards graduation
would be six credits and would
be graded “S” and “U”. Credit
in physical education would not
he made retroactive to any pre-
vious date, but would begin with
the Fall, 1972 semester. The bill
recommended that all students
enroll in Foundations of Phy-
sical Education (PE 101), al-
though it was not a requirement.
The bill also called for the
abolishment of the physical
education requirement at
SUNYA, if the Chancellor of the
State University would approve.
This request to the Chancellor
could only be acted upon if the
State University Trustee’s policy
on physical education was
changed.

who have a 4 credit physical
education requirement to satis-
fy, will have to take either three
or two semesters of physical

courses are taken.

All upperclassmen now have a
one year requirement to fulﬁll
due to the fact that one year of
the original two year require-
ment was waived by the Under-
graduate Academic Council. The
Physical Education Department
had requested that the Council
waive one year of the require-
ment due to their limited staff in
relation to the num tars of
students in the past. Doctor
Alfred Werner, Chairman of the
Men's Physical Education De-
partment, commented that he
doesn’t expect to waive any part
of the four credit requirement
for new freshmen at this time.

Werner, speaking on the re-
quirement, said “that if the only
reason that students take phy—
sical education is because it is
required, then it should be an
elective."

in a letter dated August 3,
1972, the Chancellor of the
State University, in response to
the Senate's request, stated that
the Executive Committee of the
Central Administration is dis-
cussing the issue of the physical
education requirement with the
intention of developing a re-
commendation for the Board of
Trustees. It was hoped that this
recommendation would result in
a new policy being issued by the
Board of Trustees concerning
the physical education requiri-

munt.

ltohcrt B. Morris, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, In a
memorandum stated "that lit'
_cxpcctcd the Albany request to
eliminate required physical

education would precipitate an
overall policy for the State
University." He noted that no
action has been taken by the
'l‘rustccs for the Fall, 1972
semester, thcrcl'orc, physical
education continch to be
required for graduation at
SUNYA. As soon as action is
taken by the 'l‘ruslces, Dcan
Morris assured, all faculty and
students on the Albany cumpus
would be notified.

Under the new physical cdu~
cation program, PE 101 will be a
two credit full semester course,
while all of the original quarter
semester activity courses will be

One major problem that has
arisen due to the new program in
physicaleducation concerns the
student who has taken three-
quartcrs of a year of physical
education and only needs one-
quarter of a year more to fulﬁll
his requirement. Under the new
program, the student will have
to take a full semester course
since no quarter courses are of-
l'ercd. Werner, in reponse to this
problem, commented that
“when you huvc change, prob-
lems arise that can't be helped."
Werner claimed that it wouldn’t
be possible to offer quarter
courses for students who found
themselves in this situation.

Michael Freedman, Undi-r-
graduate Studies, [JUlllLl‘tl uul

Trustees policy makes the phy

State University of New York at Albany Friday, September 15, 1972

by Bob Mayer

George McGovern could not come to Albany with the
same optimism that accompanied him to Miami. One must
almost wonder whether the lonely, depressing days prior
to the Democratic primaries once again loom over the man
and his army of followers.

Yet there was a time when 70 per cent of the nation did
not know who he was. There was a time when drinking at
campaign parties was done to for at problems, not
celebrate victories. There was a time w en the prairie man
from South Dakota was given no chance of capturing the
Democratic nomination and those who thought differently
were viewed as naive idealists. And what proved to be of
least importance, there was a time when Harris and Gallup
put McGovern’s support between 3 and 5 per cent of
Democratic voters.

Yet McGovern had something to tell America and as
more and more voters began to realize that they could
trust Muskie to commit himself to nothing, or that they
coundn’t put Humpty Dumpty together again, a man some
said had no charisma began to look like a refreshing change
from the stale bread being offered.

And then came New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and
Michigan, and suddenl Time and Newsweek started writ
ing about some kind oi/new political phenomena that was
beginning to make itself felt in American politics. As
Michigan and Wisconsin rolled by, it was becoming easier
to understand how a hard hat in Detroit was voting for the
same man as the student rebel in Madison. What strange
wonder was making its way into the political fiber of
America?

The answers became clearer as Democrats in Texas and
New Mexico voted, as Oregon and finally California made
their choice. A lot of people were fed up with the “old
politics" of political expediency and favoritism.

George McGovern went to Miami and it was his show all
the way, but things have not gone smoothly since. His first
vice-presidential running mate was forced to leave the
ticket because unlike the rest of America, he was guilty of
the moral sin of psychiatric aid at one time. His campai n
contributions have been challenged and the polls offer
little optimism. With all of this behind him and much more
ahead, George McGovern came to Albany yesterday.
