One way of preventing a bike theft is through the use of thick
chains and locks.

 

timing To Bike Owners

by Steve Dallal

Are you one of the many
students on campus who own a
bicycle? If you are you might
become another of the many
students who have had their
bicycle stolen in the past year.
Since the start of this academic
school year, bicycles have been
stolen iit an alarming rate. On
Colonial Quad for example, an
average of one to two bicycles
are stolen every day. The drama-
tic rise in thefts is mainly due to
the increasing number of bicy-
cles on campus.

Why have so many SUNYA
studean brought their bicycles
to school this year'.’ Steve
Schwartz (also known as “10
speed Steve") of Hamilton Hall
is a bicycle fanatic. His main
reason for having a bike on
campus is “just because" he
"enjoys it," llrI often enters
endurance races and has ridden

cross-country from New York to
Boston. Other students like to
ride not only because it is con-
venient, but because they just
like riding bicycles.

However there are many here
who use their bicycles as a
means of getting around. just as
others would use a car. Many
feel that riding is a lot better
than taking SUNY shuttle buses
and that it makes downtown
Albany, Colonie and Northway
Mall a lot more accessible. One
cycling enthusiast, Peggy
Skieresz of State Quad feels that
having a bicycle is “the best way
to get away from the hassles and
pressures of Albany State. A
short ride down School House
Road," she claims,"hritigs you
into the country and away from
the sterile whiteness of Albany
State.”

Whatever ones' reasons for
owning a bike. you have to take
great care to prevent yours from

library Service Improved

by Michael Sena

The university library is now
open until 10 PM Friday and
Saturday nights under the new
direction of C. James Schmidt.

This increase in library hours
was done without an increase in
library staff due to new re-
scheduling procedures, according
to Schmidt.

Schmidt recently replaced in-
terim libraries director Jonathan
Ashton who returned to tea-
ching here in the School of
Library Science.

()ther Developments

A Government Publications
Department was created this
year consolidating the activities
of the ltecords Department and
the Documents Room. The
Government Publications
Department, located in room
8-29 of the library basement,
will order, receive, and house all
government publications. All
available federal, state, city,
local, UN and foreign publica-
tions will be kept there.

Department, according to Mr.
Schmidt.

Schmidt disclosed that the
library budget this year is
$2,4 87,000, the same amount as
last. year.

He also said that the size of the 1

library staff is approximately the
same as last year. There are 170
full-time employees plus student
assistants. Of that total, 55 are
librarians, and the remainder are
typists and stenographers. One
problem that has plagued the
library is a lack of workers to
catalog new books. There is
presently a backlog of 10,000
volumes that have not been
catalogued, and the library ex—
pects to purchase some 40,000
new volumes this year. Schmidt
estimates all of last year’s acqui-
sitions will be catalogued by
January of next year. There are
presently some 600,000 volumes
in the library and the library is
still expanding rapidly.

The response to the question

varied. With the help of program

city chairman George Itamsen

horned to the new check-out
system put in operation in Janu-
ary 1972. This was when the
entire collection was reshelved
and recatagorized.

Books with titles from A-K
were all placed on the third floor
and books with titles from L-Z
were located on the second
floor. The library staff assumed
that since this system was more
“logical”, it would become
easier for library users to find
books. This system, used at the
Library of Congress, cuts down
the delay in getting books on the
shelves to about 24 hours.

Libraries Director Schmidt
hopes that increased hours and
the creation of special depart-
ments and the elimination of the
cataloguing backlog will improve
service.

For the future he hopes that
the total potential of computers
and advanced information tech-
nology can be examined in an
effort to make records more
iicccsible and accurate, and to
improve service to the university
community.

Under the direction of C. James Schmidt (above), newly appointed

Although they are living in a

are faced with discrimination.
Off-campus housing and summer
jobs are hard to obtain, and
students are often hampered by
racial prejudice. Encouraged by
the authorities, most inter-
