by MarcyLRothenberg‘

The Pierce Hall Day Care Cen-
ter was originated to provide
low~cost, high quality day care
service for the university com-
munity. Such a facility embla
parents of small children to con-
tinue their education without
the hassle of crippling child-care
costs.

In operation since February,
the center is run as a parent's
cooperative. Meetings are held
monthly to discuss curriculum,
ﬁnances and general programs.
Approximately 92% of the funds
needed to operate the center is
contributed by the parents in
the form of graduated fees. The
remaining 8% is provided by
Student Association.

The center is equipped to ac-
commodate up to 30 children,
ranging in age from six months

to five years. Many of the chil-
dren in Pierce are under three
years of age; most other day care
centers do not accept children
that young. Consequently, there
is a considerable waiting list:
two out of five applicants must
be turned down.

The fulr-time staff is composed
of three group-heads and one
assistant. They are supported by
the energies of Community Ser-
vice vmunteers, work-study stu-
dents and parents themselves.
Dependable persons who like to
work with children are en-
couraged to volunteer their ser-
vices. Interested parties are
asked to phone 436-0184.

Besides the need for human
resources, the Pierce Hall Center
is faced with financial problems.
it is currently trying to raise the
$3,000 necessary to meet pre-
sent operating costs throuin De-
cember. Without these funds,
the cost to the parents will have
to be increased. Should this hap-
pen “half the people would drop
out," according to the staff,
since most are students with
limited incomes.

One year ago this past Wednesday, theAttica prison revolt ended
With a police assault that left forty-modead. including thirty-hm
inmates and ten hostages.

Following the insurrection, a commission was appointed by Chief
Judge Stanley H. ﬂuid of the State Court of Appeals to investigate
the events surrounding the Attica rebellion. Heading the nine-
member commission was Dean Robert McKay of New York
University Law School. One SUNYA graduate student, William
Willbanks served as a member of the panel.

Three days ago, the Commission made its report public. The
highlights of the investigation are contained below, along with
related stories on pages 6 & 7.

The
indings

McKay: Possibility of Another

The
ecommendations

-Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller
should have gone to the prison
before ordering the assault to
satisfy himself that there was no
alternative, and that all pre-
cautions against unnecessary
force had been taken.

--The riot was no conspiracy
by revolutionary prisoners, but
rather a “spontaneous burst of
violent anger” by a new breed of
inmates unwilling to accept the
“petty humiliations and racism
that characterize prison life."

—Rockefelier could not and
should not have granted com-
plete amnesty to the prisoners
but might have waived prosecu—
tion for some of the lesser
crimes.

—Prisoners should retain all the
rights of citizens except that of
liberty of person, including the
right to be adequately paid for
work, to get and send letters, to
express political vieWs, practice
or ignore religion, and to be
protected against summary
punishment,

'Prisons should no longer be
“shrouded from public view,“
but should have free circulation
of literature, regular visits by
outsiders,
outside by prisoners.

and controlled trips

-Only minor changes have
been made at Attica since the
riot and the possibility of a
recurrence is "very real."

—There was indiscriminate fir-
ing by some police who stormed
the prison. All 10 hostages killed
in the assault died from police
bullets.

~Guards and police clubbed
and otherwise brutaiized many
prisoners as they were being
herded back to their cells.

-—No evidence substantiated
rumors that prisoners were sin-
gled out to be killed by the
assault force, or that any were
"executed" after the prison was
retaken.

—The assault was not carefully
planned to minimize loss oflife.

Attica “Very

—Programs should aim at en-
hancing the “dignity, worth and
self-confidence of the inmates,
not at debasing and dehumaniz-
ing them.”

—Community groups and out—
side professionals should be al-
lowed to pirticipate regularly in
prison in life.

'Guards should be paid well
and trained to “sensitize them to
understand and deal with the
new breed of inmates from the
urban ghettos and to understand

McKay Commission
Hits Racky,

Jails

Weapons were not the most suit-
able', there were no safeguards
against excessive use of force
and no adequate arrangements
for treatment of the wounded or
prevention of reprisals against
prisoners.

~National guardsmen entered
after the shooting stopped and
did not fire a shot themselves.
They provided the first medical
treatment.

-Prison ofﬁcials gave out false
reports to newsmen of prisoner
atrocities, and some resisted con-
ceding the true facts when they
became known.

—The prison system and entire
criminal justice system needs re-
structuring to make rehabilita-
tion the main objective.

Real”

and control the racism within
themselves."

—Vocational and other educa-
tional programs “must be con-
ducted in accordance with the
preceding principles. "

-The “unfair” parole system
must be changed to include clear
standards for grant or denial of
parole, procedures to inform an
inmate why he has been denied
parole, and ways to help him
find a job and a place to live if
he is released.
