Reactions
to McKay

Reactions to an investigative
commimion's report on the
bloody Attica prison uprising
have ranged from optimism
about its role in fostering prison
reform to allegations of bias in
favor of the inmates.

Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller
and Correctional Servica
Commissioner Russell Oswald
have said little about the critical
ﬁndings.

Rockefeller congratulated the
nine-member McKay Com-
mission for its work, but did not
take up the report’s assertion
that he should have gone to the
prison before ordering the as-
sault that led to 38 deaths.
Oswald, the man in charge of the
prison system then and now, had
no comment pending his analysis
of the 514-page report.

"The testimony and narratives
assembled by the commission
will help in understanding the
problem and the events leading
up to and during the rebellion at
Attica," Rockefeller's three-
paragraph statement said, in
part. "This is essential to
carrying out our prograrm for
improving our system of crimi-
nal justice."

Rockefeller, who asked state
judges to appoint the commis—
sion shortly after the incident,
did not mention commission
recommendations for prison
reform or a number of other
highly critical points leveled by
the commission at the state's
handling of the bloodiest prison
riot in American history.

Oswald, while not commenting
directly on the report, said at a
news conference that Rocke-
feller's presence would not have
resolved the situation because
the rebels‘ demand for amnesty
would have remained a stum-
bling block.

Rocky Refused
Oswald’s Calls

'l'he McKay Commission's re-
port, made public Wednesday,
shed light on the dialogue which
took place betwaen Gov.
Rockefeller and Russell G. Os-
wald, State Corrections Com-
missioner, during the three»day
Attica uprising.

Wounded men lie on stretchers inside tiie Attica Correctional Facility shortly after a police assault with
tear gas and guns regained a portion of the prison that had been held by rebellious convicts. Picture

taken Sept. 13, 1971.

The report said that before
ordering police to storm the
prison, Oswald phoned the
governor three times suggesting
that Rockefeller come to the
prison.

The ﬁrst call was after the
"observers" had pleaded with
Oswald for Rockefeller to make
an appearance, the commission
said.

At a public hearing held by the
commission, Oswald testiﬁed
concerning’that call:

“1 suggested that it would
seem that it might be approp-
riate for someone as warm and
understanding as Gov. Rocke-
feller to walk that last mile and
come, although 1 went on to
express the View that I didn‘t
feel that it was going to be
productive."

Later, the commission indi-
cated, Oswald phoned the
governor again and suggested he
agree to come to discuss a re-

yected 28-point peace plan if the
inmates released the hostages
and returned to their cells. The
governor rejected that proposal
also.

The report says that Oswald
phoned the governor a third
time on the following morning,
just before the assault, and asked
him if he had thought about the
matter again through the night
and had reconsidered. Rockc»
feller remained firm in his deci-
sion not to come

Willbanks

by Glenn von Nostitz

"The facts speak for them-
selves."

So spoke William Wilhanks, a
member of the Attica Investi-
gating Committee, yesterday.
Wilbank talks from a vantage
point that is more revealing than
most. A graduate student at the
School of Criminal Justice here
zit SUNYA, he served on the
special state investigative com-
mission that probcd the bloody
events that occurred at Attica
State Prison one year ago this
week.

Wilbanks was one member ofa
widely diVersiﬁed panel that in«
cluded a housewife, a wealthy
businessmen, and an exvconvict.
In retrospect, he feels the
unanimity the committee
reachcd was surprising, in view
of the varied elements that
comprised its whole.

The small disagreements that
did exist were ironed-out during
long hours of committee merit-
iiigs, where the report under
went careful scrutiny. Additions,
deletions, and compromises were
made, and in spite of the con~
troversial recommendations,
consensus was ultimately roach-
ed.

Ari Unsure Role

At the start of the hearings,
Willianks was unsurc about.
exactly what had happened at
Attica, but after it year of in-

depth research and study his
thoughts lllth' taken definite
shape,

Faults All

Attica Principals

He feels that all of the princi-
pals in the Attica tragedy are to

blame. Comments Wilbnnks:
“There were no heroes at
Attica."

Consequently, the report
criticizes the inmates, Governor
Rockefeller and Commissioner
Oswald, the State Police, and the
prison authorities. The group
least criticized in the report was
the National Guard which was
responsible for administering
first aid and performing other
essential services. Wilbanks
notes, however, that the Na-
tional Guard command was not
required to make any important
decisions and that they did not
participate in the shooting.
“Perhaps if they were more in-
volved, the report would have
criticized them too." he said.

Wilhanks revealed that it was
not the Committee members
themselves who did the actual
investigative work. Rather, the
state hired general staff workers
to do most of the actual re-
search. ’I‘lius thc Commission’s
rolc evolved into supervision
over the staff forces.

willlttllkli, on the other hand,
had 'il somewhat unique posi-
tion: he was the only student on
Lhc panel. He has a strong in-
tvriest in the field of criminal
Justice, so research work came
naturally to him. Eventually,his
experience in the field helped
him direct the actual research.

Over 3,000 personc were inter-
viewed throughout the course of

the investigation, including in-
mates, policemen and prison
authorities. Testimony was
heard from Commissioner Os-
wald and Governor Rockefeller.
And the committee had free
access to information on autop-
sies, various government docu-
ments, and “every other piece of
information the state had
available concerning the mass-
acre.”

One problem encountered
during the project was a lack of
cooperation among State Police
and inmates. Some 20% of the
state police at Attica during the
uprising refused to answer
questions. Ten percent of the
inmates refused to cooperate.

Legislative Reluctance

Wilbanks seems to have adop—
ted ii rather pessimistic view
about the future of prison re—
form. He feels that the report
will have little effect unless the
public strongly pushes for penal
reform legislation. He clairm
that the “legislature is simply
not ready for it yet." The fact
that. “inmates do not vote" was
given as a reason for this reluc-
tance among legislators.

Wilbanks pointed out an in-
teresting irony: One of the
investigating committee's mem«
bers wasn‘t even on the com-
mittee. The particular member is
an ex-convict and has not yet
had his personal rights restored
even though he has been out of
prison for over ﬁve years.

Harlem

said he noted only “superficial
changes, such as more black
oriented hooks in the prison
library."

in Buffalo

Among the speakers addressing
the crowd was Assemblyman
Arthur 0. Eve, D—Buffulu, who
acted as an observer inside the
prison during the uprising.

Speaking of that role, he siiid,
“The governor set us up to get
killed" but added that rebel in-
mates allowed the observers to
leave the prison unharmed.

“Thinking about that," he
said, "you have to believe that
the animals Were not in D yard
but outside, in the government."

Eve: 32 Inmates

Died “Beautiful Deaths”

A'I'I‘ICA, N.Y. AP — Mourners
gathered in the‘ rain outside
Attica Correctional Facility
Wednesday to honor the memo
ory of the 43 men killed as the
result of the bloody convict up-
rising a year ago.

Assemblyman Arthur 0. Eve
of Buffalo, who led the cerev
monies, said the 32 inmates
killed died “beautiful deaths"
because their deaths “contri-
butcd to the lives of others." He

stressed, however, that the
memorial activity was for all
Ihosc who died—including a

guard killed in the initial riot
and 10 hostages held by the
rebelling prisoners.

A dozen speakers including the
mother of one of the dead pri-
soners, focused on expressions
of “a determination that ‘Attica’
shall not happen again," as
editor Clarence Jones of the
Amsterdam News, a black
weekly, put it.

The ﬁrst speaker after the first
of three one—minute periods of
silent prayer was Mrs. Laverne
Barkley, mother of Elliott
"an." Barkley, 2. young Black
Panther leader of the rebels after
the inmates orgainzed in the
court heard they held. He was
killed during the assault, author-
ities say.

Holding back tears, the well-
driessed, attractive woman told
the crowd “We will never forget
this...l will never forgive anyone
for taking my son's life. 1 hope it
never happens any other place.
It should not have happened."

Jones, ii member of the McKay

commission, later in the program
called on Gov. Nelson A.
Rockefeller to declare a general
amnesty for all persons con-
nected in any way, on any side,
with the uprising.

“We are here to express a
determination that ‘Atticas' shall
never happen here again. I am
sick and tired of memorial ser-
vices. I am sick and tired of
violence...We lost 43 of our
brothers...I am sick and tired of
blame. I say to our governor, if
you couldn’t have compassion
then, let’s have compassion
nowl...Let's close the wounds
and move forward with the de-
termination that it shall never
happen again."

These speakers’ remarks to the
45-minute gathering of about
200 persons were in sharp con-
trast to comments made to a
handful of reporters when he
arrived by radical attorney Wil—
liam Kunstler, a member like
Jones of a committee of about
30 outside mediators during the
97-hour rebellion by 1,200 in-
mates.

He volunteered his disagree-
ment with a special state com-
mission that said in its report
Tuesday that hostages should
not be taken by inmates who
riot to express greivances.

“Hostages should be taken,"
Kunstler said, adding that hos-
tages were valid political tools to
redress greivances against the
established system’s power.
“Out of those hostages has come
it wave of prison reform across
this country,” he said.
