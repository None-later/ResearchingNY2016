Washington Merry—Go-Round

WASHINGTON—1n the midst of
campaigning hard for George
McGovern. DenDtn'aticvice pres-
idential candidate Sargeant
Shriver is quietly declaring his
independence of the Kennedys.

Shriver, whose marriage to
Eunice Kennedy 19 years ago
made him a charter member of
the Kennedy circle, has thus far
carefully avoided painting himr
self as it bearer of the Kennedy
lirgrii'y.

IrrsLead, in his campaign
speeches, Shriver has drawn on
his experiences with Lyndon
Johnson, whom Shriver repeat.-
Hilydescribes its a great architect
of domestic affairs.

Shrivcr's campaign tactics it”
but those who claimed a month
ago that McGovern's elioicc ot
Slirrvi-r as his running mate was
an attempt to cash in on the
Kennedy charisma.

Intimates tell us just the op-
pusitc is truemthat neither the
Shrivers nor the Kcnnedys par-
ticularly want the association.

Members of Ted Kennedy's
staff, we are told, often view
Shriver as an outsider who par-
luyed his association with the
family into a shot at. the big
time. As proof, they review his
resume of jobs:

ron hendren

First, Shriver managed the Chi-
cago Merchandise Mart for old
Joe Kennedy. Then he ran the
Peace Corps and the poverty
program. Finally, he became
Ambassador to France,

All along the way, some Ken-
nedy insiders feel, Shriver traded
on the family name.

But Slirivcr's friends argue lllill
the association with the Ken-
nedys has hurt its well as helped
the vice presidential candidate

Twice, the Kennedys inter-
vr'ned to prevent Shriver from
accepting the vice presidency. ln
1964, Lyndon Johnson dangled
the job in front. of Shriver, but
the Kennedys reportedly ()lijet‘l'
ed and LBJ withdrew the offer,

Shrivur reacted by staying with
the Johnson Administration
even after Bobby Kennedy an
nounced he would run against
LBJ in 1968.

Four years ago, Hubert Hum-
phrey considered choosing
Shriver as his running mate, but
once again the Kennedys inter-
vened.

Then came George McGovern,
who may have offered Shriver
his last chance to declare his
independence of the Kennedys.
lf Shriver runs a good race, he
will become a powerful figure in

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER It), 1972

the presidential stakes in 1976.
Perhaps that is what. Teddy
Kennedy is really worried about.

POW PREPARATIONS

The date remains uncertain
when the 528 American pri-
soners of war in North Vietnam
will return home. But. the Nixon
Administration has made sure it
won‘t be caught unprepared
when the prisoners are finally
released.

A special government task
force—using the code name
“Operation Egress Recap" has
already set up medical centI-rs"
around the country to receive
the POWs. Once they arrive,
each will be assigned a special
counselor who has been tho-
roughly briefed ori the prisoner‘s
background from his eating
habits to sex life.

The difficulty of readjustment
is expected to vary widely A
team of doctors, who have made
exhaustive studies of POW prob
lems, have told the Pentagon
that some POWs may be surpris-
ingly healthy despite their or-
deal. Others, say the doctors,
will suffer from what is called

The Youth Vote:

the “concentration camp
syndrome." The symptom inv
elude fatigue, fits of depression,
memory loss and temporary im-
potence.

‘The Defense Department has
begun to brief families on what
to expect when their imprisoned
loved ones come home. Wivos
are warned to expect a tremen-
dous emotional letdown a few
weeks following the return. This
will come once the wife realizes
that her husband's presence does
not solve all her problems.

At the medical centers, Care
will be taken not to force the
prisoners to readjust to Ameri-
can life too quickly. Each pri-
soner will be allowed only a few
phone calls, and his immediate
family will be kept at a distance
until the prisoner has been tho-
roughly examined.

FRIEND OR FOE?

President Nixon would like to
be known as the consumer’s
friend. Yet it was the White
House that delivered the ﬁnal,
killing blow to nu-fuult. auto

mean that trial lawyers would

in forest Their loss would be the
consumers’ gain ultimately in
the form of lower premiums.

The bill that would have estab-
lished a national no-fault system
finally came to the Senate floor
a few weeks iigo. Despite the
opposition of the trial lawyers, it.
was given a good chance to pass.
But then the White House werit
to work.

At least four Republican sena-
tors, we are told, were originally
in favor of no-fault but. their
minds were changed by the
White House team. By voting‘
time, the administration knew
the bill was dead. John Evans, 8
staff man for the President‘s
domestic affairs adviser, John
Erlichman, sat. in the Senate
gallery and witnessed the execu-
tion.
