Jane Fonda in Hanoi:
Surveying the Damage Done

by Jane Fonda
Pacific News Service

I left my hotel in Hanoi at

three o'clock in the morning of

July 12th, in a camouﬂaged car,

accompanied by members of the

Committee of Solidarity With

the American People. We were
driving to the district of Nam

Sach, 40 miles east of Hanoi in

the province of Hai Hung. We

traveled at night because of the
danger of straﬁng by US planes.

By the time we arrived in Hai
Hung province, the sky had be-
gun to lighten, Many people
were already in the fields; a lot
of work is done in the dark
when there is less danger of
planes.

Centuries ago, the peasants of
Hai Hung had fought two fa»
mous battles against the Chinese
feudal lords. Later, the province,
with its large coal mines, became
the cradle of the Vietnamese
working class under French ctr
lonialism.

Nguyen Dinh Tri, well-known
author of a novel about Nam
Sach, told me, ‘Men from there
would go to work in the mines
while their wives remained pca
sants. On weekends the men
would come back homc,‘ he
laughed, ‘that way we ccmcntcd
the worker-peasant alliance.‘
Today, Nam Sach has a popu-

lation of one-hundred thousand.
The majority grow rice and raise
pigs. They are protected from
flood and drought by a compli-
cated system of miss-crossing
dikes. The importance of the
dikes becomes apparent when
you consider that the entire Red
River Delta is below sea level.
The river beds are raised many
yards above the plain due to the
accumulated deposits of silt,
washed down the mountains
over the years. A young boy in
Hanoi said,‘At the time of high
water 1 can stand on the street
here and see the sails of the
boats going down the Red ltivvr
way above my head,‘

We walked through the mud
on the narrow paths that run
between rice paddles. Ahead, 1
saw my first dike. Like all major
dikes it rose gradually about 8 or
10 meters above the fields, and
was made entirely of earth,

Some people on bicycles and a

few water buffalo pulling carts

were moving along the top. 0n
the other side was the large Thai

Binh River.

This particular point was at-
tacked for the second time the
previous morning by F-4's and
A-7’s. It is a most strategic sec-
tion, for here the dike must hold
back the waters of six conver-
ging rivers. These rivers will he
raging down the mountains in
less than two weeks.

The planes had been here twice
so far that week, and they were
expected back. Yet all around
were people, knee- and elbowv
deep in the mud; planting thi-ir
rice, carrying huge baskets of
earth to the dike: getting on
with their lives.

Someone said 1 was an Amcrr
can. Peoplr- smiled. There was no
hostility. Not any, and 1 search
ed their cycs. That will stay With
me long after the war is over.

As 1 stood on the top of thc
dike, all 1 could see were rico
paddles and, in the distance,
some clusters of hamlets no in-
dustry, no routcs, no communi»
cation lincs, no military tar-
gets just flat rice fields. Then,
suddenly, bomb craters lllll'd
both sides of the dikc, gaping
holes, some ten meters in tllil’
meter and eight meters deep.

The bottoms of thc craters were
two meters below sea level. The
crater from a bomb that had
severed the dike was practically
filled.

The main worry was the da
magc done by the bombs which
had fallen on the sides. '1‘hcsc
cause earthquakes which shatter
the foundations of the dike and
cause deep cracks that zig-zag up
the sides. Bombs has also been
used that penetrate the (like on a
slant, lodging underneath and
exploding later. This causes seri-
ous intcrnzil damage and makes
rcpair work hazardous.

'l'hough difficult to dctccl, tlic
wcakcniiig of the (like base is thc
real danger. lf thcsc cracks aren't
repaired in time, the pressure
from the water which Wlll soon
be (i or 7 meters abovc plain
level will cause the dikes to give

way and endanger the entire
Eastern region of the Red River
Delta. Since May 10th, Nam
Sach has been attacked 8 times;
four times against the dikes.

The other major dike l saw in
Nam Sach, on the Kinh Thai
River, ha been completely sever-
ed a few days before. The repair
work was dangerous because of
unexploded bombs.

Filling in the huge craters in a
monumental task. The Cuban
Ambassador in Hanoi told me
that a dozen or more Cubans,
accustomed to working in the
fields with thc Vietnamese, col-
lapsed after three hours of pack-
ing the earth into a dikc

Waiting out a heavy downpour
in the district headquarters, I
talked with Nguyen lluy Ten,
-l7»ycar old Chairman of the
District Administrative Commit-
[00. He spoke wrth pridc about
the imprOVcincnts made in Nam
Sach sincc lhc revolution of

pilals, sanitary facilities bcing
burlt. “l' told me that illitcracy

BOOkS:

“What’s a Nice Girl Like You...”

by Peace Moffatt
AP News features Writer

New York (APr‘Joycc Teitz
could have written about herself.

After all, she's the personifica-
tion of a liberated woman-—28
years old, the graduate of Har-
vard law school who successfully
coordinated the Coalition
Against the SST in Washington,
DC.
But when Miss Teitz wanted to
offer models of liberated women
in book form, she chose to write
about others—a broadcast jour»
nallst, lawyer, physician, Oceano-
grapher, physicist, company prc-
sident, campaign committee
chairman, economist, foreign
service officer, systems analyst
and writer. The result is, “What 's
a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a
Place Like This?"

Here for a brief visit, Miss
Teitz explained why shr- wrriti-
her book. “When lstartcd Work
ing, 1 found other working Wo
men who were admirablc, and
who had satisfying personal
lives, but who weren't cmasculir
ting, as liberated womcn worr-
said to be. I thought then how
hclpful it would have been to
have had models like that carlicr
So one point was to providc role
models for women, and another
was, indirectly, to congratulate
women who have workcd all
along.

“I felt it was important to go
step by step," she continues “I
wanted a personal approach to
show the women were real pcii
pie."

The liberated women Miss
Teitz wrote about do not know
each other. Eight are married,
six have children and only two
are actively involved in the femi-
nist movement. Their lives are
different, but according to Miss
Teitz, who spent three months
interviewing hcr subjects, they
share several qualities.

“They are pioneers," she says.
“in realizing pr-rsoniil aims, they
have created ncw roles which
integrate a working life into a
personal one. They slltlrc some
problems, including a lot of pros-

Miss ’l'i-iII. adds that thc singlc

In spite of the problems,
though, Miss Teitz thinks the
costs of pursuing meaningful
careers to the women involved
were slight, and the rewards
great. “It just seems that every-
thing improves when a woman is
working," she says.

The author‘s own background
was career-oriented, but she re-
calls that whcn whe was 19,
nobody suggested she might
want to go to law school, In
fact, when Miss Tcitz was 20,
she took an aptitude test and
recalls, “The results showed 1
was good at working with people
and good with words. That's
pcrl'i-cl for ii lawycr, but. what
was suggested was that l becomc

"is iiiic who is not satisfied to

who has to try to foist that kind
of “in off on other women too."

Now, with the women's libcra-
lion movcmcnt, Miss 'l‘eitz
thinks the tide is turning. In
fact, she says, “It‘s harder now
for women who want to stay at
home. But for women who want
to work" it's easier."

leisure living

WEST LAFAYETTE, 1nd , Al’
The year 2000 will be a great
iimc for leisure living with hom-
ing devices in golf balls and trees
that grow as fast as flowers,
according to James Peterson.
l’t'tt'r‘son, a professor of recrea-
lioii at lndianu University and a
spci'ialist on recreation and
parks for the extension service at
Purdue University here, sees this
prospect for the turn of the
century:
A Work week of 2/1 hours
with four~duy weekends.
Playgrounds under the
oceans, and giant domes creating
total climate control over hun-
dreds of acres of recreation land
'l‘rcos growing as fast as flow
uni now grow and forests planted
and harvested automatically
Golf balls with homing dc-
vicos and golf courses watered,
inowud and tended by robots.
Artificial moons to turn night
iiito day over broad areas of
landscape.

"The problem for us today Is
that we haven't prepared for thc
lciirurc time we already hiivc,'
l’ctursun says.

One. of the most immediate
problums facing recreation-
inindcd Americans is the overuse
of parks and similar natural
Ilrotlh‘. Limits may have to be put
on how many pooplu can be
admitted at our: time to theI
popular national and state parks,
he says.

But l’otunion said he thinks the
problems of overcrowding may
work themselves out in the long
run as loisuru time is spread over
