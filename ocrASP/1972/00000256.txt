Variety is the spice of the
current SUNYA Art Gallery ex-
hibition. The works displayed
range in type from notebook
drawings to plexigiass sculpture
and in quality from grand to

' gimmicky.

Larry Kagan’s plexiglass varia-
tions, while very commendable
works of craftmanship, some-
how fall short of being valid
descriptions of space and form.
The rope and twine imbeddcd
cubes are quirky, amusing whim-
sies. The table pieces - curved
and interlocking - please and
fascinate the eye as the gallery
lights play with the clear yet
solid plexiglass. Indeed, I
thought, these are the knick-
-knacks of the future to be
arranged on clear vinyl end-
tubles in ii room full of Con-
structivist furniture. The one
cube 1 did really like, however,
seemed to be an accident. Tire
cube appears to have been
cracked and filled with plaster of
paris which adds ti contrasting
rough surface as well as an
opaque solid material to The
plain plexigltiss cube. (The com-
ments I heard about this cube
ranged from “ugly” to “gross,”
but I loved it.) For the most
part, however, no dynamic im-
pulse or meaning of the form is
received by this viewer from the
artist and his work.

Thororighly delightful and
fresh are the “Sketches from an
African Notebook" by Sara
Skolnick. The images remain as
immediate to the spectator as
they were to the artist as a
minimum of lines describe fully

the African landscape and peo-
ple. Written indications as to
what color a certain area should
be painted maintains a freshness
of vision for the viewer because
each will mentallv f‘oaint’f a

different shade of green where
indicated by the artist, thereby
creating a new, private image. I
found the drawing of the open
sewing porches of Blantype es-
pecially appealing for their “just
across the street" feeling.

So what is happening on the
second ﬂoor of the gallery?
“Iberian Paths, No. 3" smacks
you in the face. (The reason for
this greeting, in addition to the
use of speciﬁc "bright" colors in
the painting itself, is the place-
ment of a large work at a dis-
tance of only about ten feet
from the climbing gallery-goer as
he attains the last stair.) I like
the oranges, reds, and turquoise
blue painted together, but I seri-
ously cannot tell whether this
painting by Peter Taylor is sortie-
thing more than a rcriliv fini-

addition to my living rodm.
More might have been done with
the rectangular shapes that the
colors take, perhaps dealing with
space and color more along the
lines of Klee.

Carroll Cloar's “plain and sim-
ple" (quotes because all is not as
apparent as the phrase would
imply) “The Rose Eater," is a
ﬁnely executed, detailed render-
ing of a strangely amusing rrn-
ment precis. The capture of a
ﬂeeting incident is a photograph—
ic conception, thus exacting
painting technique to reinforce
this idea. Quite possibly the
event never occurred, in which
case Cloar has snapped an in-
ward photograph of a moment
of imagination. What is import-
ant is the preservation of that
delicious moment of the rose
eating.

if variety is the spice of this
show, then selection and omis-
sion constitute the vinegar of
reviewing it.

Isaac Hayes Plays RPI

Isaac Hayes will appear in Con«

Troy, New York on Friday Sep-
tember 29 at 8:00 pm. as part
of a weekend program presented
by the Rensaelaer Union on the
R.P.l. Campus.

It's been ti long journey for
lstiac Hayes in his quest for
recognition. But he’s already

soull classics as “Hold On I‘m

chestra, and be transformed
familiar songs, such as “By The
Time I Get To Phoenix” and
"Walk On By,” into eleven and
twelve minute mood pieces, of-
ten proceeding them with in-
tensely personal monologues.
More recently, ti double-record
album of his score to “Shaft,”
the MGM film about a Black
privritr eye, became the No. 1
LP in the country.

His music innovations, his
mysterious, spiritual image, and
his rise from cotton fields to
concert halls prompted his fol-
lchrs to dub Hiiycs “Black
Moses." Accordingly, his “Black
Moses" ulhiim covur depicts
Hayes on a river bank dressed in
a long hooded rohe. The cover
unfolds in the shape of it cross

donated to a home for the elder

money to Black students, he's
appeared at the Colorado State
Prison, and he's been involved
with philanthropic organizations
In Memphis.

Considering everything that
he's accomplished thus far and
hearing In mind his capacity to
create new surprises. Isaac Hayes
will certainly reign as one of the
phenomenons of the 70’s.

Johnny Cash and 50’s R Er R

by Ron Barnell

Two of the best shows of the
summer "specials" attractions at
the Saratoga Performing Arts
Center occurred on successive
nights in June, and in many
ways the music performed those
two nights had some long-stand-
ing historical bonds.

The Johnny Cash show, return-
ing for its second appearance at
SPAC, featured country western
singer Cash singing some of his
standard numbers like “I Walk
the Line." “Bo Named Sue,"

Starts

and so forth. It was helpful to
keep in mind that Cash started
out originally hack in the early
50's as a rock and roll singer
with such choice numbers of the
day as “Ballad of a Teenage
Queen" or “Home of the Blues,"
Presently, however, Cash and his
travelling show have been em»
phasizing the country-gospel tra-
dition that a lot of the contem-
porary country-western scene
seems to be involved with lately.

opened up the show with some
renditions of his early rock and
roll songs (he both wrote and
sang “Blue Suede Shoes" before
Elvis Presley made a million-
dollar hit out of it), and closed
with a ﬁne country-ballad,
“True Love is Greater Than
Friendship,” that he wrote fora

Next out in front ofthe SPAC
audience were the Statler Bro-
thers, a gospel-oriented quartet
group who, like the Carter
Family that followed their act,
drew heavily on the folk<ballad
material of the Tennessee and
Virginia uplands region, con-
siderahly updated in their own
special brand of modern prose.

sung in alternating choruses and
rounds that led to a conclusion
of stunning effect. Joining Cash
for the finale was his charming
wife June Carter, who also. sang'_
together with Cash on “Jack-
son" and "If I Was a Carpenter.”
All in all a great show, one to be
enjoyed by all, even if they're

scene.

ing of “Maybeline,” has man-
aged to ride the crest ever since
and currently has two records on
the charts: “My Ding-A-Ling"
and an album “London Ses-
sions." Music of this era has
made it big comeback as cvr-
dcnccd by the large audience for
the Shri Na Na concert at Sara-
