 Boaters Have '

,Winning Attitude

by Nathan Balant
If enthusiasm and spirit can

win games for a team, then,

Albany’s soccer team should go
undefeated. ‘The team's whole
outlook has changed; obviously
for the better.

After interviewing co-captain
Uzi Haimoff and several players
on the team and watching their
practice, I believe that the soccer
team has an excellent season
ahead of them.

_The players are really behind
their new coach this year; a
sharp contrast to last year’s
team. The new coach, Norm
Wingert, appears to relate very
well with the players. Uzi says
that this is due to the coach's
winning attitude, “He not only
expects us to win, he knows we
will, and the team knOWs it too!
We are going to sweep our first

three games, provided we have '

no injuries to any of our key
personnel. After that, -people
will start noticing us." The two
factors Uzi emphasized were the
great new coach and the new
winning spirit that has taken
over the team.

The cocaptain added, “Our
mgjor; question mark is our
super goalie, co-captain and last
year’s MVP, John Thayer. He's
out with a bad leg, but our
number two goalie can more
than do the job."

Several of the players men-
tioned the fact that the team
had won a scrimmage tourna-
ment this past weekend. defeat-
ing Ulster County Junior Col-
lege, 1-0 (one of the toughest
junior colleges in the state),
Hudson Valley, 3-0, and tying
Orange County, 11. Carl Haeus-

ing, a three year Albany veteran,
mentioned that this was the first
tournament Albany had won in
his memory.

With the football team rebuild-
ing. the soccer ﬁeld just might
be the place to see a winner this
fall.

T DANES WIN
SCRIMMAGE

by Lloyd Fishman

The 1972 varsity saccer squad
under first-year coach. Norm
Wingert, is one of ability and
high hopes, The team, trying to
recover from last year’s ghastly
2.9 mark, is looking to take the
SUNYAC title.

Wingcrt, a former soccer star at
Hartwick. and now a graduate
student at Albany State, is
highly optimistic. The hooters
have looked impressive in
practice as well as in their pre-
season tum-ups. Last weekend,
in a tournament sponsored by
Hudson Valley Community Col-
lege, Albany took the games
with a 2-0-1 record defeating
Hudson Valley and Ulster C.C.
by 3-0 and 1-0 scores respec-
tively and tying Orange C.C.

This weekend howcvcr, Lil”
Dunes faco a stiffer challengi-
with a Quadrangle at Albany.
Participating will he (,‘olgatv,
Williams, and Plaiisliurgh, along
with till' host loam.

Coach Wingcri has reason to In-
proud of his team. 11c says,
"almost all starting players arc
key players.” At fullback,
Wingt-rt has co-captain Larry
Herzog (center fullback) and
John Sirircicr who the coach
cites as the fastest man on the
squad. Strecicr was a forward
last season, and Wingcrt says,
“he has come a long way”.

At halfbacks, th' Danes rcly
on George Kclcshinn and Karl
Hausing. ’l‘hc hooters coach
liutcs, "They are the motor of
tho mam. If they play well, thl.
learn moves wcll." 'l‘hcrel'orc, as
Kclcshiari and Hausing go, thi-

team goes. lt will be up to them
to move the squad.

Up front, the Danes arc pin-
ning their hopes on Carlos A1-
varcz. The exceptional forward,
who Wingcrt says has “the
qualities to ho an All State and
possibly an All-Amoricanplay—
or", will he rclir-(l on heavily to
score goals.

The goaltcnding chores might
be a prohli-m for :i whilc, 'I‘hc

top performers, John 'l‘hayt-r,
