Only those students with whom
the two ofﬁces could not. come
to a satisfactory accord over bills
had their registrations termi-
nated, said Biesler. This high
number of dismissals is unusual
and not expected to reoccur
without similar circumstances.

’l‘crminations, or dismissals,
basically fall into two categories;
academic and disciplinary, There
is a large difference between the
two types of dismissal.

Academic dismissals over the
past five school years have been
inﬂuenced by a wider range of
factors, according to data sup-
plied hy Dr. Bruce Gray, As-
sociate Dean of University Col-
lege. These factors include the
University's motiing to the up
town campus in l967I the begin-
ning of the E.O.P. program in
i968, the student strike in the
spring of 1970, and S-U grading
and its problems in 1969.

The number of students
dismissed for academic reasons
has never been more than one
hundred for any school year
since 1964 according to Gray's
ﬁgures.

that it is very easy for workers
to grab food whenever they
want. Snack bar workers could
“steal” food, too, but Zahm says
there are fewer of them working
at a given time, making them
easier to watch.

Some students are sure to ob—
ject to the new regulations or
harbor other complaints about
their jobs. Zahm says there is a
deﬁnite grievance procedure this
year, outlined in the employ‘
ment pamphlet. Workers can car-
ry a complaint to a supervisor, a
chef, and ultimately to him. Last
year the grievance procedures
were not effective, Dimtisfied
workers organizad themselves
and sent representatives to
Zahm. Hc say; he talked with
them last year and will do so
again if another organization is
formed.
