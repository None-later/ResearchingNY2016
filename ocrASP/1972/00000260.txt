There was that silent air of
expectation in the waiting room
of Page Airways as some 100
local McGovern campaign work-
ers and the local media awaited
the arrival of McGovern and
Kennedy. Two of the perhaps
most popular men in the coun-
try were about to land in a small
urban city called Albany in up-
state New York. Those in the
room felt a sense of importance
knowing that in a few short
minutes they would share in a
moment of history that men of
importance and fame bring with
them. Outside, a small group of
welcomers waited for a glimpse
of the men before they would
head for the downtown assem-
bly.

After the United 727 carrying
the Democratic nominee anrl his
colleague landed, the two pro-
ceeded in a somber, quiet and
melancholy way towards the
small group of people. Somehow
I sensed that the two men felt a
terrible strain that a campaign
must inevitably place on a candi-
date.

Both men wore the face of
disappointment and as Ted
passed the starry-eyed admirers
who said “I saw Jack here" or
“He's just like Bobby,“ Kenne-
dy‘s face spoke of personal an-

 

guish and grief. To the people
shaking the hands of the two
men it was like finding oneself in
the presence of royalty; to the
two men it was another day's
campaign ahead of them, and
the road to the White House was
all uphill.

Both men had seen happier
(lays and now more than ever
they knew the country needed
their help. it was a decision one
could not change and each of
them had acCcptcii the challenge
and sacrifice years ago.

As the two men arrived at the
capitol area over ten thousand
people lined up on the sidewalks
and flowed into the streets to
greet their arrival. Being familiar
with the problem: that disturbed
America, the crowd had not
come so much to hear what
McGovern and Kennedy had to
say, but rather to see the men
who could meet the problems
and hopefully bring America
home again. McGovern seemed
encouraged to hear Mayor Corn-
ing‘s statement that this Was a
bigger crowd than had turned
out in l960 when President-to-
bc Jack Kennedy spoke from
these same steps.

After Corning introduced the
two senators, Ted Kennedy
spoke, adding some sarcasm and

levity to the rally when he told
the audience, “I know the temp-
tation that the voters in Albany
face. If you vote for Richard
Nixon he‘ll take Nelson Rocke-
feller out of Albany and send
him to Washington. We ask you
to make a sacriﬁce. Put up with
Nelson for two more years and
vote for McGovern on November
7.”

Kennedy went on to say,“Now
the question we ask is the same
one that was asked in 1960.
What kind of leadership do we
want for this country and for
the world? The choice for 1972
is a choice between the comfort-
able and the concerned. It is a
choice between those who care
only for the rich and special
interest and those who care
about every citizen. it is basicalv
ly a choice between government
for the few by Richard Nixon
and government for all by
George McGovern.“

When Kennedy introduced
George McGovern a loud cheer
went up from the audience that
was heard far into the business
district. They yelled for him as if
all their hopes and dreams, all
their frustration and anger, all
their disappointments and griefs
could be carried away on the
shoulders of this solitary mini.

McGovern, like Kennedy,
opened his remarks with the
same humorous sarcasm. He
apologized for a delay, saying,
“First let me say that we are
sorry about the delay because of
the electrical problems on the
P.A. system. But we don't have
as many electric wire experts as
President Nixon does.”

McGoVern spoke confidently
about winning the election and
vowed to restore government to
the American people. He lacks
the persuasive oratory skills that
his colleague and friend from
Massachusetts possesses, for
McGovern is an issue oriented
candidate — and his supporters
seem to Care more for his ciindor
and sincerity than anything else.

Before he could finiiih his ad-
dress the rain begun to full heavi-
ly and the two men escorted by
numerous secret service men and
reporters run for cover

The crowds, anxious to get out
of thiI rain and return to their
cars and buses, left “to streets
surrounding the capitol clut-
ten-d.

For most. the rain was no
liothi-r Many felt it was well
worth the chrome to meet the
man they hoped would bring a
little more sunshine to
America.

enereul Disease:

Symptoms, Preventionmnd Cure

Last year there wore 403 cases
of gonorrhea treated at the
health service here on campus,
and probably equally as many
people went to the Washington
Park Free Clinic and/or Albany
County Health Department.
Thouin not nearly as many,
there were cases of syphilis
found and treated. What about
those who did not know that
they hiid had ii contact and may
well he ll reservoir of the di-
sease? What about those who
just did not seek treatment? Will
it, like a cold, just go away?

The consequences of untreated
VD can be felt many years after
the contact with the disease.
Gonorrhea will produce sterility
and arthritis in both males and
females. There is painful pelvic
inﬂammation in women, as the
bacteria begin to invade the re-
productive organs. Babies can be
blinded during delivery if the
mother has this disease at the
time. Gonorrhea can he passes
on until treatment is obtained.

Syphilis can result in insanity,
bone deformities, heart disease,
and it can be congenitally passed
on from mother to baby. Un-
treated, syphilis can be passed
on for up to four years.

The signs and symptons of
both of these diseases are very
different. Gonorrhea detection is
relatiVely easy in males, for they
usually know themselves that
something is wrong. They have a
great deal of pain and burning on
urination and there is a pus
discharge a few days after they
have come in contact with the
disease. Detection in women is
very difficult because they do
not notice the signs even when
they are present. The vaginal
discharge, when present, may be
thought to be normal. Our
health services’ policy is that ifa
girl is up in stirrups for any
reason, a culture for gonorrhea is
automatically done.

The signs of syphillis will de-
pend on which of the three
stages of the disease is present.
The ﬁrst stage will have a sore
on the point the bacteria entered
the body. This can be genital,
mouth, or sometimes the fingers.
In females this may be internal
which makes detection almost
impossible. This sore will usually
disappear without treatment.
This is mistakenly thought to be
the end of the disease. The
bacteria is actually spreading
throughout the body. Within
about 6 weeks to 6 months the
secondary stage of the disease
may begin to show itself. This
can entail a rash on all parts of
the body. This rash will not hurt
or itch, and will last from a few
days to three weeks. Patches of
hair may begin to fall out and
the person may begin to experi-
ence severe headaches, sore
throat and inflamed eyes. If un—
treated these symptoms will also
disappear as though the disease
had been cured. The tertiary
stage is Intent for possibly years.

There are no clinical signs
usually at this stagi, and the
presence of the disease is de-
tected by a blood test. The
bacteria begin to attack the cen~
tral nervous system, the brain,
bones, and ultimately will spread
to all organs of the body.
Prevention of these diseases is
a great public health problem.

measures may help to cut down
the incidence, but will never
wipe it out.

Though we cannot prevent this
disease we still are able to cure it
at any stage of development.

Massive doses of penicillin can
be given and usually will take
care of the infection. If someone
is allergic to penicillin there are
other types of drugs which can
be used just as effectively. It is
well to remember that penicillin
was thought to be a cure for
everything when it first came on
the market. Since then we have
found that there are strains of
bacteria developing immunity to
penicillin. There are strains of
gonorrhea that are beginning to
do the same thing.

A single dose of pencillin may
not be effective in treating any
one of the veneral diseases. It is
therefore requested that the
person return for a check up in
about a week. If the pencillin
has not stopped the growth of

the bacteria it will continue to

cause damage, and can still be
transmitted. Contact with and
cure of syphilis or gonorrhea
does not mean immunity. Even
if someone had the disease and
was cured, if he is again exposed
he has just as good a chance of
getting it again.

Anyone, no matter what his
age, can obtain a diagnostic test
and treatment for syphilis and/

A Matter Of Concern

by Al Senia

Venereal disease-dong a subject of embarrassment, uninterested and
general public ignorance-43 becoming a growing problem for
concerned public health ofﬁcials. The reason is simple: gonorrhea is
spreading at an alarming rate here on the SUNYA campus, across
New York State and nationally as well.

Reported cases in the United States have increased ﬁfteen percent
in the last five years. An estimated 75,000 New Yorkers will
contract the disease this year alone. And here on campus. infirmary
head Janet Hood comments: “We’ve had a problem of epidemic
proportions for the last few years."

To deal with the unprecendented increase, New York State health
officials have launched an ambitious, sophisticated prevention
program aimed at screening, identifying, and treating those with
venereal disease and have coupled it with a broad education,“
program to bring the issue to public attention.

The program is primarily aimed at those between the ages of
fifteen and twenty-four, the group reporting the highest increase in
gonorrhea.

National Epidemic

The increase in V.D. on the national level can be traced back to the
mid—sixties when a widespread sense of complacency settled over the
general public, the medical profession and the government. The
problem seemed under control; treatment and prevention program
gradually found their funding lessened and, eventuallkeliminated
altogether. Gonorrhea then began a resurgence, steadily climbing up
the statistical ladder and spreading from the inner cities to suburban
areas. The situation here in New York State provides an interesting
case study.

In the mid nineteen-ﬁfties, (and very early sixties) the rate of
reported gonorrhea crises stayed at a rather constant rate of 20,000
per year. By 1964, it had grown to 33,000 cases, a noticeable rise.
The increase became more pronounced four years later when 46,000
cases were reported. By 1970, public health officials found
themselves with a full-fledged epidemic: nearly 50,000 cases were
reported that year, a one hundred and twentyvfive percent increase
in the space of a decade.

By the end of this year, about 75,000 people should be infected
with the disease. Sophisticated reporting and tracing techniques are
no doubt responsible for some of the rise. But there will be more
gonorrhea cases reported in the state this year than cases of mumps,
tuberculosis, chicken pox, strep throat and the common cold
combined.

“That is what. we call an epidemic.‘ commt nts Mr. Daniel
Vandermecr, the Veneral Disease Program Coordinator for the
Capital District. "Over two percent of the male population between
twenty and twenty-four years old has the statistical potential for

n

t

acquiring the disease.

"Everyone is talking about an epidemic," echoes Mr. Mike Roskoe
of the Albany County Health Department. “The increase is

nationwide."

“What we have is a whole lot of balling and Very little education in
preventive techniques," summarized a third spokesman. “It’s just
amazing."

Statistical increase

Here on campus, Dr. Janet Hood of the Student Health Service is
so concerned about the problem that she has met with residence
staff personnel on the quadrangles to discuss the cause, scope and
prevvntion of the disease. She, along with members of her staff, have
volunteered to make themselves available to small groups of
interested students “at virtually any hour of the day or night” to
provide information and guidance.

The campus llH’Tt'ilSL‘ in gonorrhea this year is not especially more
pronounced than the year before (when 400 cases were reported and
diagnosed) but, according to Dr. Hood: "It has been a steady
problem and it has not been decreasing."

Statistically, the university V.D. rate seems high but a truly
adequate measuri- is Virtually impossible. ltates are usually measured
in terms of number of cases per 100,000 population. Using this
criteria produr'cs a rate higher than that reported by forty-three
states (including New York) last year. However, the infirmary's
(-xt'cllt'nt reporting system, and the fact that the population here is
in that population segment most directly affected by the increase,
are compensatory factors.

()n the other hand, there is no way to measure how many students
Wt'lll to free clinics, medical centers or private physicians for
treatment

The oiin certainly In that the higher than inn-rage rate is of concern
to lll)i\'('l'.\ll_\' hciilth officials and is probably higher here than in the
rest of the (fiipitiil llistrict.

What is of more immediate concern to Dr. lloinl Is the four
reported cases of syphilis this year. The disl'nsl’ is more dangerous,
lasts longer, and is more difficult to treat in its advanced stages than
is gonorrhea. The case rate here is “much higher than the rest of the
city," according to llooii, who went on to comment: “That scares
me."

(‘ause and Prevention

What factors are responsible for the dramatic rise‘.’ Health officials
blami- a combination of factors A general lack of public attention
and information, the increased use of birth control pills (and a
corresponding decrease of the us:- of condoms, which help Check the
spread of the disease) and, of course, inc‘eased sexual promiscuity.

But there In also ii complicating factor Involved: What officials call
the asymptoimiln' character of the iliseusc

When a male contracts the disease, symptoms are easily recogni-
/.able Not so with women. l'lighty to eighty-five percent of women
who contract the disease have no idea they are infected; they show
no symptoms. The result is what Vundermeer calls “a great reserve
of unreported infected females that can unknowingly spread the
disease Very rapidly."

To combat this “silent epidemic,’ a number of federal state. local
and private agencies are pumping money into treatment and
diagnostic facilities. Vanderineer estimated that over three million
dollars will be channeled into statewide VD prevention, and evrn
that is probably not enough.
