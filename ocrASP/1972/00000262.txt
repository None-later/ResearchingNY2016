Save Day Culilre

by Tom Crane
Associated Press Writer

New York AP — Hundreds of
social workers left their jobs at
Day Care centers throughout the
city yesterday morning to stage
noisy picketing at Nixon cam-
paign offices in Manhattan to
protest against impending cuts in
federal funding of the centers.

One group of demonstrators

turned up at the Roosevelt
Hotel, where the New York
Committee to Re-elect the
President is located.

A mass protest meanwhile
took place at a Nixon storefront
campaign office at 620 Madison
Ave., where shouting, placard-
waving pickets pushed inside and
disrupted all campaign activities.

As the demonstration grew to
about 1,000 persons-most of
them women-the picket line ex-
tended around the corner to-
ward lt‘ifth Avanuc on both 54th
and 53rd Streets, llninlt’ll‘
tionally establishing a (ll)|ll)lt'
line in fruit of the New York
campaiiig headquarters of Sen.
(ivorgc McGovern, on East hilrl
Street.

The demonstration was called

by Local I701, Community and
Social Agency Employees, an
affiliate of th AFL-ClO State
(Tounty and Municipal Em~
ployecs, and the “Ad Hoc
Committee to siivc New York
Day Care.“

The Rev. Leonard Miller, as
committee chairman, said a third
of the city's 180 day care cen-
ters face closing and 90 more
under construction would be
wiped out by legislation now
before Congress.

A picket sign read, “Nixon cut
day care funds 50 percent-stop
him!" At 11:15 am. more than
an hour after the protest began,
pickets at the Nixon storefront
spilled over from the sidewalk
and took over the street,
blocking all traffic on Madison
Avenue and forcing police to
detour it to Park Avenue.

Local I701 said skeleton
forces were left on duty at the
various day care centers to look
after the preschool children of
working mothers.

Leaflets in English anti Spanish
told passerbys that “funds for
people to livu continue to he cut
back while Nixon continues to
spend .‘iillitl million a day on the
criminal Vietnam war."

The lcafIi-ts said $l00 million
could finance the city's day care
centers for four years and ex}
horted, “We must stop politi~
ciaiis from ripping off our Cltll‘
dreii's lth's now,liel'tire It'stoo
latc.'

“if I were President Nixon

Revolution

Peace Courses Study Change and Conflict

by Mindy Altman

You are walking along the po-
dium. You are passing through
the Campus Center Cafeteria of
the Lecture Centers. There are
people around you who are in
costumes and make-up, They are
motioning towards you, pleading
with you, pointing at you, ask-
ing you questions. They are
reaching out, telling you some-
thing. You stop, look, listen,
think. That's it, think. The point
of it is to get you to think.

The people in the costumes
and make-up are part of Ed
l-layes' Theater and Revolution
class, and to get people to think,
according to Hayes, is one of the
main purposes of the class. The
Theater class is one of two
taught by Hayes. The other
course is entitled Peoples‘ Libe-
ration, and both courses are part
of the Peace Studies Program
which has been instituted at.
SUNY Albany.

The Peace Studies Program is
being conducted as an inter—
disciplinary approach to the
problems of war and peace,
social change and conflict resolu-

tion. Ed Hayes' courses are
taught through the Political Sci-
ence Department under their in-
dependent studies program. The
Political Science Department,
along with the Afro-American
Studies, Anthropology, English,
Philosophy, Rhetoric and Public
Address and Psychology Depart-
ments, are offering thirty-two
courses this term as part of the
Peace Studies Program, whose
aim is to explore practical solu~
tions of the aforementioned
problems on an international,
national, and local level.

This is based on the premise
that a meaningful analysis of the
issues of war and conflict can be
best achieved through a “syn-
thesis of insights" and data from
various fields of knowledge. The
Peace Studies Courses are basic-
ally divided into two groups;
International Relations and Con-
flict Resolution.

It is Hayes’ courses which seem
to be attracting the most atten-
tion, however. Hayes, who is not
officially an Albany faculty
member, but rather this semes-
ter's “pacifist in residence" is
from the Radical ’l‘hcater ’l‘rain-

ing and Organizing Center in
New York . He has many strong
ideas abouts education and the
classes that he is conducting
He believes that on the whole
too many peace studies pro-
grams are on an intellectual and
abstract level and that it is inhe-
rent in the nature of a peace
studies program to reject a lot of
what academia holds - namely
the traditional classroom set up
where the teacher is the leader.
Hayes believes that the teacher
should be more of a coordinator
where his ideas and participation
and those of the students are on
an equal level.

Concerning his classes here, he
described the Peoples' Libera—
tion course as an exploration of
alternative life styles such as
co-ops, collectives, and com-
munes. It will also consist of
looking for alternative educa-
tional systems and ways to free
ourseIVes from the roles of 50A
cicty. This includes sharing
thoughts and getting in touch
with one another. The Peoples'
Liberation class spent the week-
end of September 15-l7 at
Dippikill to help devolop the

course's direction.

Hayes described the Theater
and Revolution course as “de—
signed to give everyone the idea
of the effect that theater has on
social change in a non-violent
way."

The course has two focuses.
One focus is of students learning
the skills of guerrilla, street and
puppet theater and then going
out and doing the theater to see
the effects on the audience. The
second focus in that of inviting
people of other theaters, such as
The Living Theater, and The
Bread and Puppet ’Iheater, to
come up, talk about what
they're doing and demonstrate
their styles of theater. The
Theater class attended a training
weekend during September 8-10
at Dippikill.

Hayes believes that "strong po-
litical convictions can be ex-
pressed through the use of art,"
namely, theater. He wants the
“demystification of the arts."
What this means is that people
need not be professional actors
to work in theater. Theater has
to be integrated with social
change. He feels that “theater is

a way of asserting ourselves and
also has great communicating
value. It deals in symbols which
speak to people. It tries to make
people think." Hayes also be-
lieves that the university campus
is somewhat like an island, iso-
lated from the rest of the world.
His courses are an attempt to
make people aware that there is
a world outside.

The Peace Studies Program can
presently he used as a second
ﬁeld and anyone who is in-
terested should contact his advi-
sor. According to Barry Sloan,
student coordinator of the Pro.
gram, Albany is one of the few
schools in the country to offer
such a program and has been
asked by a number of institutes
and foundations who would like
to study our program and supply
grants if such a program would
become a major.

According to Sloan, a Peace
Studies Ofﬁce will soon be set
up in Social Science 375. He
emphasizes that anyone who
wants to volunteer their services
is welcome.

Once again this year, the ln-
dian Quad kitchens are spon-
sering a vegetarian meal plan for
those studciils who were less
than enchanted with the ad
mittedly limited choice of
cuisine lli. Albany.

'l‘hc vegetarian plan, which be-
gan operation last Tuesday
t-Vcning, offers meals acetrptable
to people who, for health,
moral, or other reasons, reject
animal flesh as a source of nour-
tslimi-nl.

Home students decided on the
vegetarian plan out ofdislike for
the cafeteriii's treatment of
meat, calling it "too grcasy" or
simply “lousy”. Others chose it
because of their objection to the
slaughter of animals for food.

“Last year, lots of kids didn‘t
really follow the vegetarian
pliiii,‘ said Diane Blitstein, ini-
liatiir of the project this year. “i
mean, if tltc cafeteria was having
Southern-fried chicken, they'd
lakc it. lltit this year, i think
"tire of the kids are what you'(
call ri-iil vegetarians."

'l‘hc cooks iit liidian take much
of the food from the regular
"it‘llll, l.lH'll change it to fit
Vi-gi-lai'iiiii requirements, pro
ducing dishes such as spaghetti
without meatballs. They also
prepare such delicacies as lentil
stew and artificial meats (from
mashed soybean iiitd other sul)‘
alttllt't‘hi Naturally, the partici-
paling studciils may also choose
from lht' variety of other funds
available to cvn-ryonc At least
one slttili-iil rcsuiiu-d llll' regular
meal plan this year, dissatisfied
wtll‘ llll' quality of last year's
vegetarian i-itlri-i-s

()itiiitiiilly, tlic pliiii was iii-
tended for one hundred slu-
dciits. llowvver, when only
twenty students responded, Mr.
.li-rry (furrow, lii-iid of the ltitliun
Quad ltllcllt'llh, approved the
project anyway. Half the stu-
diiittii ilthlth'll belong to the "-1
plus 12".. ii. and cxpcriiiient iii
communal living.
