Delivntown . is Friend ier
But Buses A Pain

by David Lerner

While the prospect of catching
an 8:00 SUNY bus when it's five
degrees below zero and it just hit
8:01 might not strike very many
people as being quite humorous
(unless you are pathologically
sadistic), a large amount of stu-
dents, mostly freshmen, are
going to have to undergo this
ritual every day. twice a day for
a year. The question asked of
these lost souls was what did
they think of living downtown
in the Great Ivy Way? Herewith,
is what a few of them thought,
minus a few very colorful adjec-
tives.

The one overriding item on
everyone's mind was the bus,
described anywhere from too
small, too slow, too bumpyI but
“thank God it comes." Not
everyone was as kind in their
criticism, but it was universally
disliked. Aside from this how-
ever, all other comments about
Downtowa were strikingly posi-
tive.

Philip Safran, a freshman said,
“The people are much friendlier
there (downtown) than up here.
Probably because we're all fresh-
men and there aren‘t that many
of us." He continucd that then-
"is a party just about every night
on weekends if you can find it "
He explained thiit weekends be-
gan on Thursday night and con»
tinued until Sunday.

Most students like the idea of
larger rooms without suita be-
cause there is more room for
parties and such, but found that
it becomes necessary to retreat
to one of the lounges if the
roommate won't shut off his or
her stereo when the other wants
to study.

Further, it seems that no one is
down there at all except to sleep
on weeknights and to line during
weekends. Everyone stays Up-
town during the day because of
the trauma of taking the bus
Imckand forth. '

This problem is also their big-
gest asset, that of being able to
“get away from it all" after
classes every day. Also, they are
across the street from the city
proper, with all of its attrac-
tions. Then too, many Uptown
people migrate Downtown on
weekends for precisely the same
reason besides just getting to
visit friends and seeing once
again what a real brown building
looks like.

Finally, the two dissenting
commean heard about life
Downtown had to do with food,
First, much of the food caten
Downtown was “what Uptown
people did not eat.“ And worst
of all (and prepare for it shock‘
iiig disgrace beyond words), the
COKE machine did not work
until September 12! (Fan you

Seyles Hall Houses Internatio

Sayles Hall on Alumni Quad
has been converted from a
graduate dormitory to an Inter-
nation House. Work began on
the concept of establishing a.
residence hall for the purpose of
housing international students in
September, 1971. Ruth Fordon,
counselor in the International
Student Ofﬁce, working in con-
junction with Dr. Ward, the
Director of the International
Student Ofﬁce, sponsored open
meeting to set up a committee
that would write a proposal for
the International House. This
proposal was submitted in
January of 1972 and approved
by the Student Affairs Council
on March 9, 1972.

According to the “Proposal for
the Establishment of an Inter-
national House," the purpose oI
the House is to "provide an
optimum menas for fostering
intercultural understanding, a
'conducivc atmosphere for the
student from abroad to beneﬁt
fully from his overseas sojourn,
and a facility allowing pro-
gramming emphasizing inter
national educational education."
It is to scer as the center of
many cultural activities in-
cluding varied menus, films,

Located on SUNYA‘s downtown campus is Saylcs Hall (above)
which houses sonic l00 graduate and undergraduate students, About
40% of the residents are from foreign countries.

 

“31‘

speakers, concerts, informal
language classes and intercultural
workshops.

Currently there are approx-
imately 100 students living in
Sayles International House both
on the graduate and under-
graduate levels. The students
come from countries throughout
the world representing almost
every continent, Americans are
encouraged to reside in the
Intemationai House, and about
60% of the students living there
now are American, with 40% of
the students coming from other
nations. Since the program has
just begun, many of the people
that applied last. spring to live in
the lntcmational House were
admitted. However, according to
Miss Fordon, it is hoped that in
future years an cljual balance
will be achieved between
American and Foreign studean,
males and females, graduates and
undergraduates.

iiiilStiidenis

Whenver possible, an American
student rooms with a foreign
student so that each can take the
fullest advantage of the oppor~
tunity provided by Sayles to
know people of other culture.
Sevinder Singh, a foreign gradu-
ate student from India majoring
in Business Administration and
one of the three resident ad-
visors of the International Heuse
admits that at times there is
some difficulty in understanding
one’s fellow students, but that
everyone gets along famously.
He feels that the House “makes
foreign students feel at home
and gives them a strong sense of
identity," Most people involved
with the International House
seem to agree that it is enor-
moust successful in helping
foreign students adjust to the
academic community, as well as
providing a base which will bring
about better understanding of
individuals of diverse cultures.

Environmental Program Shows Promise

“pretty good, about as we ex—
pected," according to Scott.
Leading the way was the Ens
vironmental Forum, being con-
ducted by ,Professor Rienow.
“There is a lot of faculty interest
in Environmental Studies." con-
tinued Scott.

Professor Scott explained the
thrust of the program, saying
that, "One must look at En-
vironmental Studies as a dis-
cipline concerned with the world
as a whole system. The concept
of environment has its own
theme, and its own body of
knowledge. What is needed are
cnvironinciitaiists with multiv
disciplinary backgrounds."

Such ii background is what
Professor Scott brings to the
program As an undergrad he
niajorcd in biochemistry, and
did graduate work in botany. He
has hall a Ionglinie concern for
the chIronment, Though he
does have this background, he
docs admit to lack much know-
ledge of the social sciences, and
says that, "'l‘he scientiﬁc
answers are around. Solving the
problem of the environment is
inoslly a social problem."
