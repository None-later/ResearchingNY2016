Viet Veterans
for McGovern

Dear Veterans in College:

The nomination of Senator
George McGovern for the Presi-
dency has been greeted with
enthusiasm by veterans all over
the nation. Letters pledging a
willingness to work or financial
support for the campaign have
come from people on active
duty in Vietnam, Germany anti
bases throughout the world.

Twenty-ﬁve years of prepara-
tions for war have brought to
America ten years of actual war.
The veteran has become the for-
gotten man in this deadly game
of “brinksmanship.” Senator
McGovern‘s proposal to reduce
defense spending to a reasonable
level and to divert our resources
to the more pressing social and
economic needs of the American
people is of great importance to
the veteran,

The legislative record of
George McGovern has reﬂected a
strong stand for the veterans of
all wars. A decorated combat
Veteran of World War ll, he
favors increases in the Cl Bill to
meet the rising costs in educa-
tion and extensive government
action in cooperation with pri-
vate industry to curb the high
rate ol' unemployment confront-
ing today’s veterans. Unlike

Beisler Objects

Richard _Nixon, Senator McGov-
ern does not have a "secret"
plan for peace that has failed at
the expense of over 20,000
American lives, countless more
Vietnamese and billions of dol~
lars. Unlike Richard Nixon, Sen-
ator McGovern would not con-
tinue to bomb indiscrimately,
nor would he bomb at all. The
McGovern plan for peace is pub-
lic, in keeping with the honor
and integrity of the American
people. The Nixon “game plan"
which equates “peace and pros-
perity" with more war, massive
bombing, inﬂation and greater
unemployment must cease. The
veteran can play a key role in
restoring peace and purpose to
American policy at home and
abroad; the election of George
McGovern as President will bring
a new and better government to
the American people.

Veterans for McGovern organi-
zations are presently forming on
campuses and in communities
across the country. Working
closely with local McGovern for
President offices, many are still
understaffed and lacking funds.
We encourage and need your
support. If you‘re short of time
and money—remember, it takes
little time to register and no
money to vote. if you haVc any
problems, questions or sugges-
tions, feel free to write or call—
we're here to help you out.

Sincerely yours,

G. Dudley Acker, Jr

"énwai’s Opeii'i'to‘ iiii on?” campus

To the students of Albany Stale,
For those in the university
community who have felt a lack
of weekend entertainment on
campus, help is soon to arrive.
This Saturday Henway’s will
open for its first full year.
Started as an experiment late
last April, Henway's will provide
dancing, l‘olk singers, theater
groups, and various other forms
of entertainment throughout the
year. The goal of Henway's is to
provide an inexpensive place for
Albany State students to go to.
without having to run off cam-
pus. The potential for such an
arrangement is enormous, many
ideas have been suggested. The
success of any idea however will
depend on the student response.

For many who remember us
from last year, this year will be
somewhat different. The interior
has been painted, we have new
furniture, we will have beer al-
ways cold on tap, and wine and
soda will be served too. Among
other proposals, there has been
talk of setting up a snack bar,
allowing campus artists to dis-
play their work for possible sale,
and showing old movies on cer-
tain nights. A community bulle-
tin board will be placed on the
outside of our entrance, so stuv
dents can leave announcements
or just about anything posted
they want others to see. Initially
we will only be open Saturday
and Sunday, but with any luck
Henway's should be open Thurs-
day and Friday in the near fu-
ture, Again, this will depend on
both the need and success of our
endeavour.

A totally student run affair,
llenway's is managed by three
students: Brad Allen, Mike
Siembieda, and Rick Ginsberg.
These people havr- worked ex-
tremer hard over the summer
and iii the past few weeks to gel
things reain for fall 1972 Other
students haVe been hired, all
help is being paid this year. What
appears to be our greatest 0b-
stacle is once again selling our

idea to the community as a
whole. The managers wish to
avoid becoming toodictatorial in
the running of Henway's, and
thus will hold a meeting every
Monday night at 7:30 in Hen~
way’s, to discuss the previous
weekend, what needs to be
changed, and any new ideas
which come up. Everyone in the
school is invited to these
meetings and all suggestions and
thoughts will be weighed equal-
ly.

One great problem Henway’s
faces at the beginning of our
operation, is to make enough
money so that our debts can be
paid off. Not only is this impera-
tive, but a constant revenue is
needed for possible emergency
changes or repairs which may
arise. Thus far, we have accrued
debts in the range of $5,000.
Such an enormous figure is the
result of buying bars and taps,
coolers, obtaining a liquor li-
ccnse, product insurance, work-
man's compensation, paint, a
partition for our entrance, and
advertising, to name just a part
of the total picture. Running a
business legitimately has proven
to be an enormous pain in the
ass, involving many more details
than I care to mention. Ob-
viously our greatest problem has
been funding, ﬁnding enough
money. Our ace in the hole has
been FSA, as they haVc almost
unbelievably helped us and
guided us in every way possible.
Henway's is greatly aware of the
help it has received, and the
managers wish to publicly an-
nounce that without FSA, run
ning an operation like Henway's
would have been an impos‘
sibility.

lit relating all this to you, the
university community, I hope to
make you understand the prob-
lems we face. In order to hire
top performers- this year, we
can't operate as cheaply as in the
past. Last year, while the place
was continually packed, we bare-
ly broki- even after the few weeks

we were open. Thul, on night:
when there is live entertainment,
(as opposed to any a record or
movie night) we must have a
cover charge to cover the cost of
the particular entertainers. Ini-
tially we will operate with a $.60
entrance charge which will en-
title you to a free beer or soda
on Saturday, and a free coffee
and donut on Sunday. This may
not sound expensive to the new-
comers, but you Henway's vete-
rans can see the disparity. Beer
prices will be cheap ($.25 a
glass), as will other prices. Please
keep in mind how much we've
laid out in advance before bitch-
ing about how much Henway’s
has changed. Remember we‘re
still student run, anyone can
have a say in our functioning,
and that we're still cheaper than
anyplace in the Albany area. If
we turn out successful, our
prices may be lowered.

So help us. Complications are
bound to set in. Already we've
discovered that our bar with taps
and coolers won't arrive until
early October, so a makeshift
bar will be necessary at the start.
We must be careful to protect
our license, so no drugs will be
allowed in Henway's, and any-
one under 18 years of age will
not be served alcohol. Offenders
of these rules will be asked to
leave. We invite everyone on
campus to come to Henway’s,
your student ID will be neces-
sary for admittance. Thus far
we‘ve signed some of the most
popular artists in the Albany
area to play for us. The rock
group Skin, The Star Spangled
Wasliboard Band, John Simpson,
and Hector will all be appearing
in our opening weeks. Henway's
can quickly become your place,
if such a desire is,shown. Watch
for our advertising, and please
come around. Just remember,
Henway‘s, located in the heart
of Indian Quad. See ya there!

Sincerely,
Rick Ginsberg
Corneliqu ofHenway's
