A Young View of Washington

The Elderly Citizens

The oldest member of the
1972 United States men's Olym-
pic swimming team was an an-
cient 25. The commentators and
experts could scarcely believe
that a man so many years be-
yond his prime could have made
the team.

And while for most of us 25 is
not a particularly frightening
age, that. swimmer has already
felt the pinch which every day
forces scores of Americans out
of jobs, and in some cases nearly
out of society. The victims are
the elderly.

For the Olympic competitors
who will be too old to particir
pate in future games, new doors
will open and new careers will
begin. For many of the elderly.
there is no such hope Only the
misery of disease, the despair of
being in want. and the loneliness
of being forgotten.

Today, one in every ten Amixri~
cans is (55 or older. By the end
of the century and let's face it,
that's iintsii faraway lhc figure
will l)t' cltrscr to one in six, or
roughly 28 mlllltttl persons.

At a time in their Ichs during
which they could coiitribulu
most in tcritis of experience,
these Americans llllVl‘ Ilt'l‘ll girl-n
llll' lcasl iippirrluiiily. At a trmc
WIll'll they most tll‘i'tl medical
care, llii-y l'illl ll‘llhl afford it At
tr Iiiiii- when friendship and corn-
llilllltrllh :iri- Vital, they are often
.ill but for-gotten. And so iiir-
stoiy goes.

More than three fourths of our
:igcd suffer from at least. one
t‘lll'ltllIC disease. (inc-half suffer
from two or more. Persons lib or
tht't‘ arc twice as likely to be in
need of medical care, and, once
hospitalized, lend to stay twice
as lt)l1|,,’llt~i young people

Physical and mental health are
related and it follows as no
surprise that. the incidi-ni-i- of
psychiatric problems ls highest
among the elderly, who also
make up the largest segment of
|)illlt’llL.\. confined to mental lius
|lll.tllb

Sovietﬂnien'

Al. the same time, half of the
families whose heads of house-
hold nre over 65 have incomes of
barely $5,000 per year. In fact, a
fourth have incomes of under
$8,000. Of the older people liv-
ing alone, half have incomes of
less than $2,000 per year,

These problems are not. new,
they simply have grown through
lack of attention. As early as
1961 the White House Confer-
once on Aging unanimously
called for the creation of an
Institute of Gerontology within
the National Institutes of
Health, And in every Congress
since 1960 William L. Springer
(R~[|l,) has introduced legislation
in the House of Representatives
to do just that. All to no avail.

But earlier this year his propos
a1 finally passed the House. If
11 It. 1114124 ultimately clears thr-
St-natv the bill will accomplish
two important objectives. First,
it Will establiin the long sought
for Instituti- of Aging which will
serve as a focal point for all
activities within the National Iii

Washhigton Merry-Go-Round
Peace Hopes Dimmer in 1972 ,_

President Nixon was elected on
a promise to end the war and
win the peace in Vietnam. He is
now trying to keep the war issue
under control until after the
election. But. military intelli-
gence reports from Southeast
Asia indicate there may be trou-
ble ahead.

When Henry Kissinger made
his celebrated transworld jour-
ney for peace just before the
Republican convention, many
interpreted it as more political
window-dressing. The President,
30 the theory went, was just.
trying to dramatize the search
for peace with no real hope of
rit'heiving it.

But we have learned at the
highest level that. the President
believed the Kissinger mission
had a good chance of succeed-
ing. Both Moscow and Peking
were urging Hanoi to settle the
war.

Nevertheless, the initiative fail-
ed and President Nixon respond
cd with some of his most hawk
ish language in his acceptance
speech Now Kissinger has again
been dispatched abroad, this
time to Moscow, Success is run
sitlcrt'd ii Iiingshtit ths time.

Iiul ll‘lt'l‘l’ is good reason for
Kissingt-r's continued frantic ill'
t.ivily. The intelligence reports
from the war zonc stay North
Vietnam still packs the punch
for one more major offensivv
The President is convinced it
could come any day now, just in
time to stir up the Vietnam War
issue before election day,

Kissinger, howcvur, is traveling
with a new rice up his sleeve. It is
President Nixon's vast Icad Ill
the polls. Hi- and the President
are hoping it thI convinci- llaniii
that, no matter what. happens,
Nixon will be reelected, They
are trying to impress upon Ilanui
that the President will be easier
to deal wlLIi before than after
llll‘ election.

MONEY SQUEEZE

Civil rights activists are private-
ly complaining that George
McGovern’s presidential cam-
paign is hurting their own efforts
to raise funds and stay afloat in
a tight. economy. Many liberals
who might. otherwise contribute
to civil rights causes are giving to
George McGovern this year.

One group caught. in the
squeeze for liberal money isIthe
Southam Christian Leadership Con.
ference, founded by the late Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. We have
learned that. SCLC decided to
close several of its branch of-
fices. SCLC headquarters in At.-
lzinto refused immediate com-
ment on our inquiries. But. we
have learned that sc-Veral people
who are leaving the organization
intend to work for George
McGovern.

McGovern, meantime, will con-
tinue to compete with civil
rights groups for money and
personnel, but will try to revive
interest in the civil rights move
thIIl which has seen its political
impact. on the nation diminish
considerably since thtI death of
Dr King three years ago.

DIFFERENT ENEMY

A I‘t'tfi'lll Dt'ft’nsc Intelligence
Agency report discusses those
iiiililnillisLIt' missiles that the
Sovrcts havr- installed around
Moscow and Leningrad.

In the past, it was assumed
that HIV Russians were worried



about. an attack from the United
States. But the DIA report. aux--
gests that the Russians were
really worried about. the me.
dium-ranged nuclear missiles
which the Chinese were develop-
ing. These will be capable of
striking cities deep within the
Soviet. Union.

We have already reported that
the Chinese have deployed a
small arsenal of short-ranged nu-
clear missiles—all aimed at the
Soviet -.porl. of Vladivostock,
located just. 30 miles from the
Chinese border,

none KONG CRACKoonliil

For decades, British-controlled
Hong Kong has functioned as an
international watch for foreign
nations trying to find out. what.
is going on inside mainland
China.

Now that. China has begun to
open its doors to the world, it.
has also begun to complain
quietly to the British about for
cign spy operations in Hong
Kong directed against the main-
land. In rcsponse, the British
have effectiver cracked down
on Soviet and Clllnf‘ﬁl.‘ National-
isl spy rings.

IIUWUVI‘I’, the British Will make
no ovorl. move to force the
United States to reduce its over
sized China consulate in Iiong
Kong. But the British will cau-
tion the United States to limit
its operations to monitoring
Chinese broadcasts anti inter-
preting Chinese periodicals.
