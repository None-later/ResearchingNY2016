Heroin Examined

“IT’S SO GOOD, DON’T
EVEN TRY IT ONCE.” Heroin
in Perspective. Edited by David
E. Smith, MD. and George R.
Gay, M.D. Prentice-Hall. 208
pages. $5.95. Spectrum paper-
bound $2.45.

Heroin, says Dr. Gay, “is the ‘I
don’t give a damn drug,’ the
social anesthetic."

And the search for the anes-
thesia, the escape it produces,
has brought an explosiVe epi-
demic of heroin abuse. Once
confined mainly to ghettos,
where it was largely ignored,
heroin recently seized middle-
class white American youngsters,
and more likely blue-collar kids,
and untold thousands of Viet-
nam Gls.

Why the appeal of such a drug,
so “good” a first experience can
be highly euphoric, but later so
dangerously addictive and des»
tructive? Drs. Smith and Gay
offer a diagnosis and discuss

Sex roles are not perpetuated
in Soviet schools. After examinA
ing children's books available in
Soviet bookstores, I‘ve found
that Soviet children are not ex-
posed to storybooks which de-
pict the mother as the house-
keeper and the father as the
worker, which many children's
books in the United States do.
In fact, the Soviet people can
not grasp the meaning of the
word 'housewife.’ A Russian
women asked a friend of mine
what her mother's profession
was. After attempting to ex-
plain the wife/mother role, the
Russian woman asked,‘Doesn't
she work?‘ To withhold one's
services from society is a crime
in the Soviet Union.

As a socialist state, the Soviet
Union does not use or exploit
women to sell goods or services
as do private companies in the
United States Absent are those
disturbing advertisements which
portray women as mindless
people whose main interest fo
cuses around make-up, fashion,
and how to get. a man. 'l‘hisis
not to say that Soviet Women
lire not interested in looking
attractive. In the (lum depurl.
rnent store in Moscow, women
stand in line to buy stylish
clothes. Beauty parlors are be
ginning to spring up. Contrary to
IlUIlUIur belief, Soviet Women
have not turned into masculine
creatures. They are women who
are responsible, independent,
complete individuals and are
capable of performing in all us-
pucla of life.

Drug abuse is by no means a
simplistic, cause-and-effect af-
fair, controllable by “law and
order" methods, they write.

“The bitter fact is that heroin
dependence and other drug
abuse patterns that include
tranquillizers, alcohol, sleepting
pills are merely the symptoms of
a complex medical, psycho-
logical and social disease whose
causes are interwoven with the
very fabric of American society.
We can cure America’s heroin
epidemic only by understanding
the full dimensions of the pro—
blem and developing effective,
consistent means of treatment
that are based not on precon-
ceptions but on ‘what works."'

drug abuse problem to be ‘Public

Enemy Number 1,’ we must
realize that the trueenemy is
ourselves-witness our immoral
and unjust involvement in
Southeast Asia, our racist atti-
tudes, our inability to deal with
problems of minority ghettos,"
and other social ills.

“Our country must undergo an
immediate and dramatic re—
orientation of national prioritim
and we must look for contem-
porary solutions to contem-
porary problems," they assert.

Other authors discuss the
pharmacology, the social and
psychological aspects of heroin
use, and treatment methods, in-
cluding methadone, Synanon,
Daytop and other programs.

In a concluding chapter, Dr.
Allan Y. Cohen says people use
drugs because they want to and
will stop only when they want
to. The course, he says, should
be to ﬁnd alternative, not sub-
stitute, attitudes, strategies,
activities and life-styles that can
help people attain their legi-
timate personal aspirations. An
appended glossary of street and
drug terms add another passport
to understanding a complex
epidemic through this insightful
book.
