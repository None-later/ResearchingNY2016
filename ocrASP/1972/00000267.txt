Coffee House

v It‘s underneath a what?

' The Eighth Step Coffee House, located on 14 Willett Street in
Albany, is truly a “peoples” coffee house, open to everyone’s
digestions and talents. This non-profit organization, run by 21
directors (including a warm and friendly manager, Jake Bryan, and a
programming committee) is now in its fifth year of operation.

The Coffee House's program is wide and varied. Monday thru
Thursday nights include ping-pong, bridge, rapping, and if-you-want-
-you-can-sing. The first and third Thursdays of the month are open
nights, when anyone who would like to perform, by singing
sketches, strumming, etc.. can do so to an appreciative audience. The
last Thursday of every month. a movie: This month it‘s “Dr.
Strangelove.” livery second Thursday there‘s a discussion, but,
because of the incredible ﬂexibility of scheduling in order to meet
everyone’s needs, these Thursdays (or, in fact, everyday) may be
switched up, turned around. or transferred.

As you walk into the coffee house for the first time, you may
think that you havethe wrong place. But, after going inside. you feel
at home, comfortable and relaxed in a couch. with friends. in a
warm atmosphere. Martha. the waitress. will tend to your every need
and serve you ciders. coffees. teas. or cocoas, ranging front darj'rcling
tea to peppermint cocoas.

Beginning about time on weekends. arid lasliiig until everyoirc's
gone. there is a paid entertainer. usually folk. (1n lflllllly and
Saturday there is a $1.50 cover charge. which really just barely
“covers” the cost of tire entertainer. Lasl Friday. a full-house plus
sonre listened to the sweet siirgiiig John Wilcox. Wrtlr a law degree
from Stanford University. John has decided that it was easier to be
honest with himself as a songwriter that it would be as a lawyer. He
has traveled throughout the lhiitcd States. and was the singer/song-
writer for~,thc l'ortable liolk l‘estival. a group of ('aliforiiia
folksingirrg friends. llis songs. such as “l’oolsgold.” “Sidewalks of
New York." or "The Road."(a|so on his album) he performs
sincerely and earnestly. putting a spell of tranquility over the
audience--yel his lyrics stay with you. Many people spontaneously
began to sing along With the songs they knew. really extending the
coffee house‘s purpose to be a gathering place and a meeting place
for the community. Unexpectedly. we were also happy to listen to
two other fine pcrforriicrs. .liin Ringer and Mary McKaslin of
California. who came ~vitlr John. l:()l all who were there. II was a
truly enjoyable evening.

Future ctenrs at the Eighth Step include a planned all-night
crecli'iri night sitting-up session and workshops in the ('ripital
Di:trict l‘Ulk Music ('lub, l’rckin' and Srirgiir' and (iatherrnf This
Friday features country and fiddle music With the Mcdcocui Trio.
and Saturday, the Star Spangled Washboard liand. ’l'lrc colt'ce house
is also used by the Dove (‘o-rip for food distribution. and as .l
meeting place for Vapccttla. a science-ﬁction chili. and is open hit
any kind of public meetings.

The lirglith Step. started by eight focus churches 111 Albany. is
relaxing. warirr. aird an almost profitable place to go it what yotr
want is good music and friendly people. any day ol’ the week.

By the way. it's easily found at the corner ol State and Willcit. |tisl
