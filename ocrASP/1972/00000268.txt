Brandenburg Concerti

by Glenn von Nostitz

The Bradenburg Concerti
now outnumber the 1812 Over-
ture in the Schwan Catalog,
which lists twenty-four complete
recordings of the Bach, and
twenty-two of the 'Ilichailrowsky
With so many versions now on
the market, there is quite ob-
viously something for everyone:
high price, low price, large or-
chestra, small orchestra. There
are even competitive versions
played on authentic versions. Of
the recordings I have heard so
far, my favorite is the Munich
Bach Orchestra conducted by
Karl Richter on DGG's Archive
label, followed closely by the
Concentus Musicus on Tele-
funken and Ristenpart on None-
such.

The Ristenpart offers a clear,
stylish performance on a budget
label, and the ’l‘elefunken offers
the old instruman with great
stylistic accuracy. But the Rich-
ter offers much more than this.

The Richter utilizes many, but
not all of the authentic instru-
ments found on the ’l‘i-lcfunkcn
recording: thc high clarin trum
pets, recorders, natural born,
and baroque oboi-s. 'l‘lu- rcsult is
a sound deﬁnitely more authen-
tic than thal fouan on most
recordings, yet still familiar and
likcziblc to our modern cars.

And With this mixture of old
and new instruments, ltichtcr
presents a performance full of

vervo, energy and infectious spi-

rit. llis approach has often l)t'('n
criticized as being too subjective,
yet perhaps with tlic Brandi-n-

burgs his lack of objectivity is a
good thing. So many Branden-
burgs now on the market lack
Richter's imagination and dar~
ing. From N0. 1 to the end,
Richter's ensemble never stops
driving, while the l Musici and
Berlin Philharmonic often sound
dragged out and tired. Richter
does, admittedly, go overboard
with his infectious spirit in the
ﬁnale to No. 3, as it is taken a
bit too fast. This is done again in
the ﬁrst movement of No. 6.

The balance between the in-
struments is nearly perfect in the
Richter recording. The ex-
ception is the opening of No. 2,
in which the trumpeLs are slight~
Iy overpowering. Otherwise, the
trumpet, recorders, oboe, and
violins have practically the same
weight. The balance is particu-
larly ﬁne in No. 5, where flute,
violin and harpsichord are equal
partners.

Speaking of No. f), the harpsi-
chord cadenza at the end of the
first moi/omen! . is played un usual-
ly well. Often times thc pcr-
former comes to a complete stop
at thi- middle of llic cadi-n'ui,
losing much of the momentum.
This problem is not encountered
in the Richter recording.

There is one other Bran-
denburg recording worth men-
tioning, which in spite of its
American budgct label, is rather
good. RCA Victrola has rc-
corded tlic (lollcgium Aurcuni.

The playing on this recording
is clean and accuratc, and With

flirly good intonation. 'l‘lic or
cliestru is very small, and the

There wu joy apin in Mud-
vilIe—at least in this comer~when
ChairMs. Wurtz of the SUNYA
Concert Baord took pen in hand
to tell the student community
that the Board would solicit
their opinions before planning
another year of concert. At least
the Board has ﬁnally decided to
crawl out of the hermetic shell
it’s been in for two years.
Hurrah!

Unfortunately, it’s all too clear
from Ms. Wurtz’s letter to the
ASP that the Concert Board still
has no clear understanding of its
function. If one could make any
realistic decisions from input
gleaned from mass question-
naires then the Board’s polling
program might make sense. Well,
why can't you get any useful
feedback via that route?

’lbere are a thousand answers
to that question, all of which
can be summarized in one
phrase: the concert booking
business is too complex for that.
You want the Allman Bros.
Band? Fine...but the Allnians
will be down in Miami recording
their next LP when you've got
an open data. You want Cat
Stevens? Fine...hc wants more
money than you can afford. You
want Hot Tuna? Fine...they're
available on a Tuesday-they cost
too much to put. in the ballroom
and the Phys. Ed. Dept. won't
give you the gym. You want
Santana? They can't decide
whether they've broken up or
not; anyway, they're not tour-
ing. Neither's Clapton...he hasn't
had a hand since January, I971.

Do you want X'.’ (Names
changed to protect. the guilty
from here on in) Sure, their
agent will let you have them if

  
 
    
     
    

you'll take the Travelling Dog-
shit Blues Band (managed by the
same greedy agency) for $3,000
to open. Do you want Y? Fine,
his manager would love to sell
him to you...especially since
nobody else will touch 'im. Not
since he’s been strung out on
smack for six months and his
drummer‘s a whip freak...they've
had to bribe untold little
chickies and their irate parents
in the last tour. Want. Z?
Remember those lovely, high,
screaming guitar lines on their
live album? That guitarist split
from them six months ago; he's
got a new band of his own now,
which you haven't heard of yet.
You will...six months from
now...when his price will jump
b/ at least four grand. What
about his replacement with the
Z's 'I‘hal dude might play better
if somebody broke his arm.

OK, I've over-sensationalized
(and for those of you who
thought they recognized X, Y, &
Z, don’t write in; you're all
right...and you're all automatic
winners of the Worthless Infor-
mation Contest! Congratula~
tions.), but you see the problem.
The business is too complex and
the Concert Board's too amateur
to begin with; all those question-
naires can do is provide another
layer of excuses for the Board to
fall back on when the shit comes
down for lame programming.

“Pay more to see a super-star
here?" Is that organization a
Concert Board or an Entertain-
ment Committee??? If it's going
to be the latter, ﬁne and be
honest about it. Change the
name, let's quit pretending that
any form of non-academic con-
temporary music can be art, and
we can send the Features writcrs
off to cchr it! (A Clevoland
newspaper once decided that
pro»wrestling should be covered
by their drama writers, not by
thc Sports Dept. Nuff said).

But if there is anyone left on
this campus who retains just a
dab of the wild, dazzling sixties
vision of entertainment of art
mixed in one swirling explosion
of emotion and life, then let‘s
try to get down with this prob-
lem and deal with the specifics
necessary to see that vision
brought; through the haze of
confusion, commercialism in the
business, and loss of direction on
the part of programmers and on
to a reality. Bill Graham (the
promoter of rock, not of Nix-
on’s Jesus) is gonna be in this
neck of the woods soon--at RPI
for a lecture. Let’s hope we find
Ms. Wurtz & the Board there.
They could do worse for a start.

Meanwhile, a few crawl-out-on-
-a-limb suggestions: bands &
people you probably haven't
heard of but will soon. Copper-
head is a roaring, full-blast West
Coast outfit headed up by guit-
arists John Cipollina & John
Murray. The ﬁrst John founded
the Quicksilver Messenger Ser-
vice and graced that band's ﬁrst
4 1/2 albums with his crisp,
compelling leads; the 2nd John
was a Haight-Ashbury original
who played with the early
Quicksilver and involved himself
in a dozen pioneer counter-
cultural activities. Their West
Coast performances have stolen
the show from Hot Tuna and
very nearly from the Grateful
Dead. Right now they're record-
ing their lst album; they're sup-
posed to come East sometime
$00".

Larry Caryl-ll and li'ourpluy are
right now where John McLuugh»
lin and the Mahavishnu Orches-
tra were at this time a year
ago-poised right on the edge of
a breakthrough in public recog-
nition of their spacey, guitar-
bascd jazz-rock cxplosions. Lar-
ry's been on the cdge a couple of
times before; cach time he's ne-
Vcr quite madc it but this time

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1972

The ﬁrst. of the heavily touted
RPI/American Bureau of the
Arts Concerts at the RPI Arm-
ory came off last Sunday nite as
a wildly uneVen show. The
Mahavishnul Orchestra was sim-
ply brilliant; guitarist-leader
John McLaughlin's playing was
ﬁrmly integrated with the band‘s
ensemble textures, pianist Jan
Hammer and bassist Rick Laird
produced some truly stunning
solos (Rick's was a real surprise;
in the past he’s been relegated
pretty much to the background),
and drummer Billy Cobham‘s
power and energy seemed
boundless. Their repetoire was a
carefullv blended mix of the
familiar-- Meeting of [he Splrlls
and You Know You Know --with
newer material written by John
and by pianist Hammer. All of
iluan hour and a hall’s worth of
some of the densest and most
complex music of our time--
worked beautifully.

To get to that, though, an
audience of about 4,000 had to
suffer through Peter Frampton‘s
opening set. Peter himself -- re-
cently cx- of Humble Pie ~- is a

 

nan.~.~.u.unu~u.i.““at. .a

McLau'

strong English hard rock guitar
player; he layed down those
thick, blocky chords that
Humble Pie was known for and
laced ﬂashy, knife-edge lead
work over them. But his band,
Frampton's Camel, was some-
thing else. The bass player was
painfully inept and the others
were obviously unfamiliar with
the material (mostly from Pete's
new LP). Frampton can't sing,
but he tried anyway, and he
can't do arrangements, so he
didn't even bother to try. In all,
it was a poor set from an artist
who can...and probably will, do
a grcat deal better.

And whcrc was J. (icils'! Good
question-whatever was left of
the audience was wondering that
for nearly an hour. ltound about
midnitc J. and the band finally
slaggcri-d in, crockcd to thc gills.
For about ii?) minutcs tlicy play-
ed 2 very short and most peculiar
sets. For a band that's, usually
extremely prccisc, they were un-
believably sloppy... and they ran
through their rcpctoirc at break-
ncck Spl'l,'(l, lliough considering
tlic shapc thi-y wcrc in. lust

 

   

     
       
  
  

 
  
    
    
    
   
   
    
   
      
    
     
   
 
   
    
   
   
    
 
  
 
  
 

 
 
 
  

   
 

playing at all was a feat. Despite
the sloppincss‘, it was all great
fun, and the audience loved
it...and J, himself played the
finest blues guitar-«high and driv-
ing-that he has in some time.
Clearly, both he and his band are
badly in need of a rcst..and so,
after almost flVL‘ hours of that
Armory, was the audience.

was not, Almost all of their
songs wore vcry good, with two

ly cxccllcnt. .loIiuli has it good
moody quality, and they usc a
lot of strong trcbli- sounds, mak-
ing tlicm slightly rcminisccnt of

out, the screams and chi-crs
brought the rest of thc audicnci-
running in, to total bi-twvcn
two and four-thousand attend»
ing. After playing two songs,
Bcrry said that they Wt'l’t'
warmcd up am! he announccd,
“lt's 8:06 now, we'll bc (Illllt' by
8:46." And at 8:40 llt' was donc,
having played some of his great-
est songs, including Hail, Hail,
Ifocli and Roll, Sir/cc! Lilllc
Slxlci'n, Muybcllnic, uml Ito/l
Utlt'r Iii'i'llioircn He also (lid his
latest hit, Ding u ling, which got
most of the young iiudicncc out
of their seats and up against the
stage.

After the “end,” Bcrry an-

nounccd that he would play an
cxtra, and its the first notes of
"Jonny ll. (.loodc“ went up, tlii.I
crowd wr-nt wild. lli-rry looked
stunned when tlic iiudicncc
drowned him out during tlll'
chorus of the song, and later
wlicn sonic gills got onto tlll'

hands (or security) to Ict the

nti-ly inundiitcd by kids. As ller~
ry finished “Johnny ll. Gouda"

after u fcw minutes tllt' stage was
clcari-d and llcrry and his group

stamping and chanting for more,
but, as they slowly realized, it

. All in till. the performing dur-
ing the concert by lluri'y'ii biiiiil
was quite good until “Johnny ll.

mostly background music and
came out to the front to show
how excellent It could be.

Last Sunday night was truly a
wonderful night at SPAC. For a
short time it seemed as if the
Saratoga concert season would
end on a sour notemthe weather
was bad, only ii half of the
ampitheatcr was ﬁlled, and Dr.
John did not show-up. Upon
licaring tblit be w'as not tripping
in that night, a number of peo-
ple left. The atmosphere was less
than pcrfcct.

But l.llt'b‘t' short-comings wr-rc
quickly forgotten as soon as
Stevie Wonder was led on stage
wearing a copper-colored
crushed vclvet djellabu. 'l'hc hap-
piness and l‘ecling with which lie
pcrformed each song radiated
tllll. to the audience. It was easy
to 500 how much performing
lllt‘tllll to him. Schral times
while Stevie was making his way
from behind his moog toward
llic microphone in the front of
the stage, his face was almost
cxprcssionlcss. OnCc he touchcd
the mike a gigiintic smile swept
across his face and his whole
body ciimc iilivc. He was in
almost constant motion and was
having a really fantastic time up
there. ’l‘hc whole show was
I'lt‘iy‘gtllllﬂ and fun. The mem-
bers of his linclcup group, Won-
ilcrlch, wnndcrcd around stage,
sometimcs playing, sometimes
Just listening and smoking ciga-
rt'Ltos.

way sini'i- the (lllyti of Littlc
Stu-Vic Wonder His music has
become much dccpcr iiliil intri-
rate. Along Willi his usual pluyv

qinlc surprised when he played

most tiilciitcd musicians to come
along Ill quite a whilc.

Stevu- played a number of his
lilbi such as "Yes to You, Yester~
me, Yesterday," and "For Once

was his "You and l“ which is on
