the first half to take the lead, as
the ball found its way through a
maze of players into the Albany
net. The second half saw Albany
.time and time again pelting a
series of barrages against the
opposition’s goalie, but was
thwarted on each occasion, until
Uzi Haimoff scored on a spec-
tacular sliding kick to record a
1-1 tie which held for the rest of_
the game.

Despite their finishing last in
the tournament, Coach Wingert
was pleased with the perform-
ance of his players. This ended
the Booters’ impressive preseason

Coming off a recent tourna-
ment victory, the Albany soccer
team met their opponents last
Saturday with high apprehen-
sions. It was the Booters' second
quadrangular meet in two weeks,
and it was felt that the momen-
tum of the Hudson Valley vic-
tory would be present there,
however two heartbreaking goals
trickled through Henry Oswald's
outstretched hands and halted
Albany's second drive for a
quadrangle victory.

The action was fast and furi-
ous, but it was as if the fates had
ruled against the Danes in their schedule with a 2-1-3 record and
ﬁrst game. Despite a brilliant a tournament victory. Coach
showing by our team, Platts- Wingert stated, “These teams are

Kevin Quinn and Ken LaRoe
combined their pitching abilities
to enable the Albany Great
Danes to gain revenge over the
Potsdam Bears last Saturday in a
doubleheader by scores of 1-0
and 7-0. Some of you returning
students may remember last
years‘ double loss to Potsdam
when they hosted Albany. It
cost State two losses in
SUNYAC play, but this week’s
victory pinned the losses on: the
Bears.
In the first contest, Quinn
allowed four hits over the first
three innings, getting into and
out of a “runners on 2nd and
3rd, nobody out jam" in the
third stanza. After two consec-
utive singles had opened up the
Bears' third, Quinn set aside 17
batters in a row. The next man
to get on for Potsdam came with
two out in the eighth inning.
Kevin then retired the last four
he faced. Thus. he retired 21 of
the final 22 men. Quinn would
haVc never gotten 17 in a row, if
Albany could have scored, and
they had many chances.

Many of the fly balls hit by
State were held up by hot, mug-
gy air that surrounded the ball
park. In the first inning, Terry
Kenny singled with two gone,
moved to second on a bulk, and
stole third base, and then catch-
er Jack Leahy hit a “one-two"
fastball into Ieftwenter. The ball

hung up just long enough to be
caught. In the bottom of,the
7th, the Danes loaded the bases
with one out. However, Kew‘n
Quinn, who narrowly missed an
extra-base hit in the 5th, went
down swinging and Dave Bentley
whiffed. Bentley retaliated for
his “K0” in the bottom of the
