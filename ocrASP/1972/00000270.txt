Lack of trained personnel, lack
of interest in becoming coun-
sellors on the part of SUNYA
students, lack of opportunities
to train new counselorsi, and
lack of space seem to be the four
major obstacles confronting Di-
rector David Messick's attempt
to reestablish Draft Counseling
at SUNYA this year. These four
obstacles were revealed by Mes-
sick at a poorly attended meet-
ing held in the Campus Center
on September 11.

David Messick, who was the
Director last year, pointed out
that he was the only trained
counselor: left, and that it would
be very difﬁcult to open the
center this year with only one
trained person. Last year 11
people were trained to be
SUNYA draft counselors. but
only 7, including Messick, lasted
through the year. This year, due

 

 

 

to graduations, attrition, etc.,
Messick ﬁnds himself the only
one left in the organization. He
pointed out that last year, they
were able to meet the com
munity needs, that is to say that

without help. Mr. Messick
estimated that the center han-
dled 800 students last year with
draft problem, questions, etc.

The meeting, which included 7
students and the Director and
this reporter, was, according to
several of those attending the
meeting, poorly publicized. This
was offered as an explanation
why the turnout at the meeting
was so poor. Director Messick,
however, counteredthis argument
by explaining that draft coun-
selling is something that takes
up much of one's time, and that
those students who wanted to
make a serious commitment in
this area were in attendance at
the meeting. He pointed out that
those students who were “too

  

 iiuris Drdﬂ Counseling ’

busy" to attend the meeting that
night would probably be too
busy for effective counselinﬂ
work. Those people with a sin-
cere interest in working in this
area would have made a serious
attempt to ﬁnd out when and
where such a meeting was being
held. By the end of the meeting
it turned out that there were
only four possible trainees in

attendance at the meeting. Mes-
sick indicated that this situation
made it very unlikelv that any
organized draft counseling ser-
vice would be available to the
students on the SUNYA campus
this year.

A third problem adding to the
difficulty of the situation is that
there would be a problem train-
ing those students who would be
interested in becoming coun-
sellors. He said three possibilities
existed: 1) That he, along with
some local counsellors could set
up a training course. However,

IPC Tours for Peace

On Saturday. September 9, a
contingent of nine men and
women from the Tri-city area
went to Syracuse to participate
in the NY. State Coordinating
Conference of the IndoChina
Peace Campaign. Groups repre-
sented included: The SUNYA
Peace Project, the Schenectady
and Capital Area Peace Centers,
the Friends Society and Albany
Area NOW

Present at the meeting
were representatives and coordi-
nators from the principal upstate
cities. The [PC will tour the
week of October 8-14. The key
cities include Rochester, Buffa-
lo, Ithaca, Oswego, Albany,
Schenectady, Troy, Binghamton
and Syracuse.

The Indochina Peace Campaign
is national in purpose but will
concentrate its energies on
awakening peace mntinnnt in the
seven states where its potential
effects can be the greatest: Cali-
fornia, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, New Jersery, and
New York. Education and Com-
munity Coordinators in each

state will go to a broad range of
community groups with new gra-
phic and informational materials
about the war; such as a room
sized silk-screen exhibition from
students at Immaculate Heart
College designed to evoke the
human reality of the war, the
culture, the land and the people
of Vietnam.

Speakers for the tour include
actress and social activist Jane
Fonda. Tom Hayden, member of
the Chicago Seven, a founder of
SDS and radical organiZer in
New Jersey, and folk singer Hol-
ly Near soon to appear in
Slaughterhouse FiVe. Tom, Hol-
ly, and Jane will discuss their
recent tour of Indochina, the
nature of the war and the cul-
ture of Indochina people. They
are also prepared to do slide and
ﬁlm shows of the above.

Also available through the
Speakers Bureau is former Spe—
cial Forces agent and ex-POW
George Smith. Area groups wish-
ing to have speakers and other
elements of the IPC tour, should
contact the CA. or Schenectady
Peace Center.

he added that demands on his
time this year, for personal rea'
sons, would be many, and that
he was not sure if he could help
in this area. 2) That students
from SUNYA could travel to
Siena College and participate in
ii program there. Messick indi-
cated, however, that the Siena
plans were not clear as of yet
and that this possibility would
require further investigation. 3)
That Central Council appro-
.iriute some funds for people to

be trained outside the arczi,
either in New York or Buffalo.
This solution, too, has not bccn
established as viable. Mr. Mcssick
added that he would investigate
further each of those three pos-
sibilities and call another mect~
ing to inform the interested
people as to what the results
were.

The fourth problem, and per-
haps the lciist important relative
to the others, is lack of space
Since last yl'ill', Ci-ntral Council

Dr. Nicholas De Luca of Al-
bany has recently been ap-
pointed principal of the Milne
School, the campus laboratory
school of the State University of
New York at Albany. Since
1970 he has been assistant direc»
tor for redesign of the Capitol
School District Regional Suppli-
mcntary Educational Center, a
planning and development
agency serving 102 public
schools and 127 non public
schools. His work for the fede-
rally sponsorcd program has fo-
cused primarily on assisting
school personnel to plan and
implement instructional and
managcmcnlprocesscs to Innkl'
llicir schools different and bet-
ti-r.

Following is an interview with
Dr. Dc Luca.

As you begin your new job,
who! kind of sliupi' is lhc Miliii‘

De Luca: ‘Milnc is coming out
of some problem years as to iLs
mission and functiom-problcms
which were partly financial and
partly method of approach. in
about 1969 the University cx-
perienced a ﬁnancial pinch and

Dr. Nicholas DeLuca (above) was recently appointed principal of

austerity, the school is finally moving ahead, according i0 DeLuca.

state school system. We worked
with students, teachers, admini-
strators and community people
for better schools. I also hc‘oed
work on aiding school districts
develop grant proposals and also
with workshops for teachers and
administrators.

Dean Gardner of SUNYA’s
School 0/ Educali'on said that,
“We are fortunate to have Dr.
Nicholas De Luca as the new
principal of Milne. He is a brighl,
young, innovative administrator
with hiin polenlial." On what
basis do you llilnk he would
make such a comment?

De Luca: i am thirty-two years
old if you want to call that
young. I have been working with
innovative programs for the last
ﬁvc year's.

Whal schools did you do your
undci'gmduulc and graduate
work ul.’

Di- IAICiIC My B.A. was in
anlliropology at Columbia. My
Masters and Doctorate are from
SUNYA. My M.A. is in Educa-
tion while my Doctorate is in
Admistralion.

Ilus Anlhropolngy been uscful
lo you In any way as (In admini-
slmlor?

De Luca: Yes. Anthropology
givcs you a philosophy and ii
framework on human beings
that allows you to be an admini-
strator or whatever. Experience
with Anthropology allows you
to look at human beings from a
lot different ways and perspec-
tives. Human relations are not
simplc. They are the product of
long trains of i-vvnls, sometimes
reaching far back into history.
So you don't take everything at
its face value. You huvu to be
aware of the things related to it.

I understand you were at
Berkeley for a year.

De Luca: Yes. I spent a year
there doing post graduate work
in Anthropology.

Would you evaluate your work
in the other posillona held?

De Luca: I think i was success’
fui in the other positions I’ve
held, both as teacher and ad-
ministrator. I was always satis-
ﬁed with my performance and
so were the people I worked for.

In a press release issued by the
SUNYA ofﬁce of Community
Relations you were quoted as
saying you intended to maintain
an excellent educational pro-
gram and engage in making
Milne a ccnler [or research. de—
velopmenl, and innovative leach-
ing lcchniques. How do you plan
lo go about (his?

De Luca: i think that is our
mission. In three years we
should arrive at that goal.

We will be changing the tradi-
tional stucture of the school. We
have already moved away from
the traditional seven department
form to four interdisciplinary
tcnching teams. We are already
in the process of examining the
senior year program to create a
four year sequence to feed into
additional oppotunities besides
the Allen Center.

The Allen Center is a program
where high school seniors comv
binc their senior higii school and
freshman college years.

How was (he sclcclion process
by which you were chosen han-
dli'd?

De Luca: it was a thorough
one. As i understand there were
five interviewed by students,
faculty, graduate students and
professors from various depart-
ments. We spent an afternoon of
nicely handled intensive inter-
view.

How did the search commillec
find you?

De Luca: i found out about
the job through ii placement
announcement and simply ap-
plied.

Ilo you have any final com-
men! you would like lo make?

De Luca: My job as an admini-
strator is to help others do their
job, not to make rules.

Anthropology says to an ad—
mislrntor, “be aware of the di-
Vi-mc circumstances surrounding
Words." The history of mankind
thrives on its diversity. Anthro-
poloig creates in a person an
awareness of the rclativcncss of
things. Nothing is hard and fast.
it niach you like people as
pcoplc and bc interested in
pl‘Opll'.

Thank you Dr [)1' Luca.
