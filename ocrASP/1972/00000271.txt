Gardner Steps Down

as Ed School Donn

by Kathryn Turone

On September 7, 1972, Ran-
dolph S. Gardner, Dean of the
School of Education since 1962,
announced to the department
charimen of that school that he
planned to resign as dean effec-
tive August, 1973. Gardner plans
to return to teaching in the
Departinent of Curriculum and
Instruction.

 

Dean Gardner has been with
SUNYA since 1947. He held the
positions of Professor and Chair-
man in the Department of
Mathematics, and then director
of education up until 1962,
when titles were changed and he
became Dean of the School of
Education. The Dean has held
his present position longer than
any of the other present SUNYA
deans.

In retrospect, Dean Gardner
felt that the last decade has been
one of extensive growth which
will never be equaled. The pro
gram which has developed the
most in the past decade is the
graduate program. In 1962,
there were approximately 500
applicants for graduate school
and of them 100 were accepted.
On the other hand, 5,000 appli-
cations were made last year and
over 2,000 students were ac-
cepted.

  
     
    
  
 
  

  

  
  

     
 

For most Albany State Students it‘s been “back to the books" this
month. But for some of us whose books were never ordered by the
bookstore, the opening of the semester has been rather enjoyable.

 

 

The faculty has also grown
dramatically. In 1962, there
were 87 faculty members and
presently there are about 192.
Gardner’s only disappointment
is the lack of progress concern-
ing the training of teachers for
two-year college institutions.

The Dean feels that the time
he has spent in his position has
been most rewarding. He believes
he has been successful through
the accomplishments of his fa-
culty and the students. However,
he thinks that the position of an
administrator ought to be
changed occasionally. Such ac-
tiun should be taken to bring

new ideas into tows within the
system. On the individual level,
he feels that the change is also
good for personal growth.

Dean Gardner would like to
write more often, as in his pre-
sent position he rarely has
enough time. He also misses
working directly with the stu-
dents. Unfortunately, now it
seems the only time he comes in
contact with students is when
they are in "trouble" or if they
have complaints. Although he
has “thoroughly enjoyed" his
administrative position he is
looking forward to teaching
once again.

by Pat Curran

There are “zero future world
:hamps”.ln the Albany State
Dhess Club' as far as club presi-
dent Jack Uppal can tell. There
isn’t even a reasonable facsimile
of the Bobby Fischer-style
player among the club's mem-
bers. (Jack personally prefers
Spassky’s approach to the game,

but has no expectations of ever
achieving the Russian's skill).
But ‘shortcomings’ such as these
don’t discourage Mr. Uppal or
his ﬁfteen to twenty chess-
mates. They continue to meet
twice weekly for the battle of
brains at the checkered boards.

"The best way to learn the
game,” says Jack, “is to play
against people who are better
than yourself." That’s how a
person eventually learns the
various systems and strategies
such as the “Sicilian Defense,“
(Yup! That's the same kind of
razzle’dazzle that was used in

ltejkavik). To sharpen their wits
at the Wednesday (7:30 pm.)
and Saturday (1:30 pm.)
meetings, the club (which con-
sists of anyone who shows up)
sometimes engages in “Five-
minute games". When each
player's clock is set to tick off
the total of ﬁve minutes he or

she will have to make his/her
moves, the game beginir—and
whizzes along at a seemingly
sacriligioua Dace for this staid
deliberate game. The competi:
tors follow the regular rules but

must make each of their moves
as quickly as possible. The
player whose clock expires first
loses the match, regardless of
who is in command of the of the
board at that time. It's an ex-
citing variation of the game, but
it‘s not something you’d do for
relaxation very often.

The twice-a-week brain-drain
sessions don't satisfy the desire
of some members to play chess.
So they participate in tourna
ments-«at school, at the Scheme
tady UMCA, and occasionally in
New York City. On September
30, a small-scale tourney will be
held here at SUNYA, and Octo-
ber 14-15 a larger competition
will be held at the Schenectady

"Y". There is a $10 entry fee for
the latter, which will be ile-
frayed for each Albany Stati-
member by the Chess Club
'l‘oumaments such as the one at
the UMCA and in New York
(Iity are often sponsored by the
US. Chess Federation or the
New York State Chess Associa-
tion. in order to participate in

these matches, in addition to
entry fees, a person must be a
member of the sponsoring organ-
ization. The are fees involved
here also, bu again, the Chess
Club can offer a reduced rate to
its members.

At present, there are at least
ten SUNYA students enrolled as
Junior members (under 21 years
of age) in the U.S. Chas Federav
tion, and Jack Uppal expects
this number to grow.

Sometime around mid-
November, the Albany State
Chess Club will host an exhi-
bition by Senior Master Ken
Rogoff where he will play
against a number of people
simultaneously.

It

For now, “chessvter Uppal
urges any and all friends of the
age-old sport, lL‘ﬂtll’tlll’SS of ability
to stop in at a meeting. What the
club really needs, of course, is a
Fischer disciple who stomps
away from the chess board in
the Campus Center game room,
refusing to play with those dis-
tracting pinball machines
“(linging" behind his back.

By the way--if you really want
to make an impression, he a!
least ten minutes late for the
meeting.

Sweetfire To Resume Publishing

by Mike McGuire

"Sweetfire", SUNYA's alter—
native newspaper, will put out
its ﬁrst issue of the year within
the next few days, possibly un-
der a new name. According to
staff member Barry Davis, the
trend in “Sweetﬁre” will be
towards more coverage of the
community and toward less em-
phasis on the campus itself.

Community institutions of
prime concern to the "Sweet
ﬁre" staff include the various
day care centers in the area and
the alternative school which is
currently located in St. John's
Lutheran Church. The staff is
also interested in forming food,

legal, medical, and auto coopera-
tivea in Albany. Cooperative ar-
rangements for getting food and
legal and medical help are fairly
common in cities in the North-
east. The auto co—op, a newer
idea, is simply a garage at a
central location in the com-
munity where community
people try to xteach basic auto
mechanic skills to other com-
munity people. The facilities of
the garage are shared by all in
the community who need them.
Auto coops are now operating in
Buffalo and Rochester.

Among movements that are
backed and publicized by.
“Sweetfire” are those for
women’s and gay liberation. Ef-
forts to attain community con—
trol of institutions in Black com-
munities will also be strongly
supported. An area of special
concern is organization of local
tenants by the United Tenants
of Albany and by tenants'
groups in the city housing pro-
jects. “Sweetl'ire” will continue
to support Albany Prison Soli-
darity.

An immediate goal of the
paper is to publicize the planned
appearance in the Capital Dis-
trict of Jane Fonda and Tom
llaydi-n as part of llll' Indochina
l’i-aci- Campaign on October 9.

“Sweetfire” is published ir-
regularly by a collective con-
sisting of “The Terror", “Shar-
ky", Alan, Barry, Jaye, Karen,
and Hormone. Editorial de-
cisions are made collectively.
Copies of the paper are available
free in various places on campus
and in the community.
