The focal point of the Indo
china war has moved again into a
region where the names are oh.
Cure, the objectives unclear and
the outcome uncertain.

For more than a month North
Vietnamese regulars have been
striking at towns and military
outputs south of Da Nang, an
area that many military analysts
believed was overdue for its
share of the nationwide North
Vietnamese offensive. 7

Que Son and Fire Base Ron's
were overrun and retaken. ’l’ien
Hiuoc fell. ’Ihen determined a-
saults were made against Mo Duc
and Ba To.

A couple of hundred militia-
men, with heroic help from an
Amerimn adviser, hdd out in
M0 Duc though outnumbered 10
(oil. The town of Ba To fell, but
the nearby camp is holding, sur-
rounded and under siege.

Hamss'mg attacks have been
building against Duc Pho.

All the towns are district capi-
tals in the three southern pro
vinces of military region 1
Quang Nam, Quang 'I'in and
Quang Ngai. ’Ibe Viet Cong
spent years booby-trapping and
frustrating American Marines
and infantrymen who tried to
clear cut elusive guerrilla forces
from the jungled mountains in
the west and the ricerich coastal
plain in the east.

Hanoi's original scheme for the
offensive, according to one ana-
lyst, was to seize Quang 'I‘ri in
the north, Kontum in the central
highlands, and Binb Dinh on the
central coast. Then they could
have closed on the provinces in
between and taken the northern
half of the country.

That didnt't happen, but it
could explain why Quang Nam,
Quang Tin, and Quang Ngai are
only now beginning to feel that
crunch of the offensive, nmrly

six months after it began.

It also is possible that the
North Vietnamese, having suf-
fered severe loss in other areas,
prefer to fight here now.

hnap'ne a ﬂock of sheep, fol-
lowed by three camels, aossing
the busist intersection of a large
US. city at 5 p.m., and You ha"
a little sense of Cairo—one of the
noisiest and most crowded cities
I've ever seen.

Multiply by a thousand the
excavations for new buildings
that mark downtown San Fran-
cisco or Philadelphia, and you'll
have some sense of how Tel Aviv
and Jerusalem look today.

These images are but a hint of
the cultural pp: that separate
countria like Egypt and Syria
from Israel, and all three of
them from the United States.
They make nearly imposible
what is already a difﬁcult task:
communicating to Americans
the tenuous and shifting rmlities
of life in the Middle East.

Even now, many American
Jews take the slightest criticism
of Israel as a sure sign of anti-
Semitism, while many American
Arabs view any disapproval of
Arab policy as proof of a Zionist
plot.

Quite apart from thae obsta-
cles to understanding, however,
I‘m handimpped by my own
feelings. Part. of rue—and an im-
portant part, too—is in Israel,
where some of my oldest and
best friends live.

I go back there again and
again, attracted and repelled,
loving it and hating it, at ease
there in certain ways I am never
comfortablo‘hcre, and equally
umnlcrtaﬂe there in ways I
never experience here,

In the past few years, however,
I have also made new friends In
the Arab world. I've come to
understand something of their
extraordinary culture and I have
developed deep feelings of
sympathy for the Palestinian
Arabs who once lived in what Is
now Israel

Bear all this in mind then as I
try to make a political judgment

But the Absence of War

mm the mctions of a
month's trip into a few words:

The whole arm, it seem. is
moving to the right. The Arab
nations are shifting in that direc-
tion and the inﬂuence of Islam is
growing among the Arab peo'
pies, Israel, too, is shifting
towards the right as the view-
points held by Israeli expansion-
ists and hawks become more and
more acceptable to those in the
center of Israeli life.

I do not think any immediate
danger of full-scale war exists in
the area. No Arab nation or
combination of Arab nations is
mpable of succesfully conduct.-
ing a ' war against Israel and
neither are the Palestinians. And,
at the moment. Israel has more
than enough Arabs to deal with,
for today Israel is in fact a
bi—national state~except that the
million Arabs who live within it
and the borders of the occupied
territoria are and will remain
secondAclass citizens. Some
Israeli leaders recognize the im-
plications this large Arab popula'
tion holds for the future of a
Jewish state; others, unfortua
nately, do not. Abba Eban has
complained that when he raised
the question of Israel's future
demography if the state had
more than a million Arabs in it,
one of his fellow cabinet mem-
bers jeered at him with “Demo-
graphy, shemography."

Arab leaders are still reluctant
to criticize publicly what they
believe to be incorrect policies
and actions of other Arabs, thus
maintaining a formidable barrier
to real peace,

Meanwhile, the voices of dis
sent in Israel have become more
isolated from the mass of the
population and more susceptible
to suppression with the assent of
the majority, The conﬂict grows
between orthodox religious
forces and those who are de-
manding a relaxation of the tight
hold the religious community
has on such matters as marriage
and divorce. The ﬁght has been

The city of Albany is not
nestled at the bottom of the
fountains, nor is it hiding in the
tunnels or lecture center seven.
It is out there in some indiscern-
able fog, und the problem of
every dorm resident is to get to
it and reaffirm his belief that
there is more to life than quad»
rungles and towers.

When the “I've got to gct out
ofherc or thesiglit of white’ll kill

be is around lots of green. If you
don‘t have too much time and
you're desperate for a park nt-
mospherc, a quick ride on the
SUNY bus to Draper Hall will
take you a block away from
Washington Park. It is u smull
replica of Central Pnrk, and al'
though night time safety is not
unr- of its key features, it is still
it place where trees are left alone
and not symmetrically aligned.
There are also some beautiful
houses in and around the park

that. are worth jealously admir—
ing.

If you have a car, or a friend
with one, take a ride south along
route 85 to Thatcher Park. This
State Park is open all year and
has a beautiful overlook area of
Albany and her surroundings.
During the warmer seasons, pic-
nic areas and swimming facilities
are available and there are scenic
trails for hiking. In the winter,
the park has a twelve mile area
set aside for snowmobiles. (Does
anyone have one, here?) There
is a five to seven mile area for
cross-country skiing and snow
shoeing and a towless ski slope
area.

For those among us who be-
lieve there is more to education
thzm the classroom, there are
places in Albany which provide
more than pure entertainment.
The Albany Institute of History
and Art, 125 Washington Ave-
nue, will have a folk art. exhibit
October 5 through 30, entitled

m...  n Arr 

“Fabric of the State". If din-
monds are your bag, then the
gem exhibit which is currently
being shown at. the New York
State Museum, located in the
State Education Building, should
prove interesting.

Starting in January the lcgisla-
ture is in session; then you can
get your education and enter-
tainment in one package by
watching your favorite State
Senator or Assemblyman in
action. In addition, tours of the
Capitol are given all year round
during the week and on Sutur-
day mornings. While at. the Cup—
ital, a visit to the nearby Schuy-
ler Mansion is also worthwhile.
Along the same vein, but. less
well known, is Cherry Hill

building is over 200 years old
and is the last of the Van Rens‘
sclacr homes in Albany. It. was

Parking Policy Presenting Problems

by Ted Isibnn

Regulating parking on the
SUNYA campus is a difficult
task. There are 3600 spaces for
over 4500 cars and some means
of coordination is obviously
necessary. New directives issued
by Campus Security were sche-
duled to go into effect on Mon-
day, September 18, but student
concern over the way they were
established compelled the Uni
vcrsity Council to defer action
until the problem could be stu-
died more thoroughly.

Enforcement. in the past has
been admittedly sporadic and
ineffective. The Personnel Poli-

University Senate submitted an
extensive report at. the Senate’s
January 31, 1972 meeting. The
report disclosed that. for the Full
'71 semester 16% of the fines
issued to students were paid, and
only 8% of the faculty/staff
penalties were collected. Accord-
ing to their report, “The conclu-
sion is that. the present fine

it effective as an enforcement

phase. John W. Hartley, Vice-
Prcsident for Management and
Planning was named chairman,
and the members included John
F. Buckhoff, Director of the
Physical Plant, Robert. G. Nurn-
berger, Professor in the College
of General Studies, James II.
Williams, Director of Campus
Security, and Richard A. Licsc,
Chairman of the Central Council
of the Student Association.

Most of the proposals were
acceptable to all members of the
committee but there were seve-
nil that were particularly irri-
table in the eyes of student
leaders.

Formerly the registration fee
had been set at $1 for two years
and the committee increased it
to $5 for one your. The rationale
behind this decision was that
funds were needed for the main-
tenance of the lots, and smu-
funds wcrc not forthcoming,
Furthermore, the yearly rcgistru
tion would facilitate planning,
since Security would be ableI to
have an accurate count of the
amount of motor Vehicles opera

Student Association President
Michael Immpert argued that the
$5 charge amounted to a “park
ing fee,“ which was illegal, and
he stated in a letter to John
Ilurtley that, “While I can accept

When you tire of attempting to

yourself that there is an Albany
Public Library System. The Har-
manus Bleeker Branch at 19
Dove Street sponsors a noon

propose crosses that thin line
into becoming a parking fee,"

Plans were made by the com-
mittee to segregate the big lots
at Dutch and State Quads be-
tween faculty/staff, commuting
students and resident students.
Faculty and staff members
would be assigned spaces closest
to the podium, followed by
commuting students and then by
resident students. The under-
lining assumptions were the
same as those in the report of
the Personnel Policies Council-
Parking Committee:

“Faculty and Staff, because of
irregular hours and in order to
avoid ﬁnancial loss to the Uni
versity and the loss of class time
to large groups of students re-
quire dependable parking near
the Podium.

“Commuting students, because
of the necessity of driving to the
campus, should recoivo first con-
sideration after Faculty and
Staff.

“Resident students, because
they live next. to the Podium and
in most cuses use their cars
primarily for recreational pur-
poses, huvu the least reason to
ruquirt- pnrking spaces near the
Podium."

Licsc, the student member, ub-
jcctcd to this entire rationale. Hc
hild originally objected to it on
the Senate floor, when the re-
porl was submitted in the form
of a motion to stand the report
back to the Personnel Policies
Council to investigate a first
come-first. schc policy for park
ing on the uptown campus.

In it memorandum to John
Ilurtlcy lic uguin raised his criti-
Cisms of the policy. He would
agree to divide the lots into
faculLy[stuff/commuting stu-
tlvnts und rt-sidi-nt students, but
commuting sludt‘ltts face the
some problems us faculty and
staff members in finding places
t'lust‘ to the podium “Why

Lampert had objected to the
$5 registration charge, calling it
an “illegal parking fee." Section
562(c)3 of the adopted policy
states, “Payment of fees for the
registration and parking of vehi-
cles...such registration and park-
ing fees when collected shall be
deposited in the State University
Income Fund." SUNYA now
had the legal authority to levy a
parking fee.

In a recent interview Lampert
‘expressed reservations as to
the wisdom of the $5 fee. Ac-
cording to Lampert, several
“peculiarities” cannot be dealt
with, There are no provisions for
students attending SUNYA for
only one semester. Should the
fee for them be only $2.50?
Many faculty members haw: two
curs. Must. they register both for
$5 each? Lampcrt is not sure if
yearly registration is really
needed for smooth administra-
tion, and he believes $5 is too
high.

Section 562 provides for the
adoption of parking regulations
by the council of each state
campus. On September 8 the
SUNYA University Council was
scheduled to meet to discuss the
proposed policy. In a letter to J.
Vanderbilt Straub, Chairman of
the Univursily Council, Lampert
requested a dclny. His appeal
was based on procedural ques-
tions.

In a precedent setting move
President Lampert appeared at
the University Council meeting
to raise his concerns The Coun-
cil agreed to defer action on the
plans to allow the community to
suggest changes.

the Senate Executive Commit-
tee declined to act and the mat-
ter was referred to the Univer-
sily Community Council of the
