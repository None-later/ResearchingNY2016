'THE ICEBERG WAs SET UP TO EMBAREASS THE TITAN/C
Frost Sees the Light at the End of the Tunnel

by Mitchell Frost

President Nixon's “Vietnami—
zation” program has so seriously
limited his options that once his
re—elction is secured he will have
no choice but to cease the
bombing and withdraw the re-
maining troops from Southeast
Asia.

In a rather comical turn of
events it was the President‘s very
own Vietnamization program
which forced him, in the end, to
ahandom our commitment to
South Vietnam. Vietnamization
is founded on the assumption
that the United States can safely
withdraw its troops from the
conﬂict while the ARVN (the
South Vietnamese army) takes
over more and more of the
combat role resulting eventually
in a totally “Vietnamized” war.
However, by gradually with
drawing U.S. support on the
ground, the President has been
forced to protect the allied ef-
fort from the air

Pentagon estimates vary
as to how long air covuruge will
be needed in the war but it is
generally admitted that such
support will be vital for at least
two years. But the President
cannot wait for two years; he is
tired of the war and waan to
throw in the towel now. This the
President has made “perfectly
clear," So the case will go to
Hanoi. ’I‘he Communists can
press either for what they need
or for what they want. If they
are satisfied with the mere neces-
sities required for their takeover
then they will simply return the
captured American I’.(}.W.s and
wava goodbye as the last of the
American ground and air forces
leave. If they want more than
jult that--if they demand, say,
that the U.S. pull out first and
topple the ’I‘hieu government be-
fore our prisoners are returned
to us then we’ll come to the final

showdown.

Gradual withdrawal was an ob-
viously absurd policy to pursue.
To pull out 95% of our troops,
substantially undermining our
bargaining position and then,
from this weakened position to
get tough with the enemy seems
entirely illogical. But recent
events have made our continucd
presence in Vietnam not only
impractical militarily but uri~
justified morally now as Well. As
Mr. James Burnham, a onetime
’I‘rotskyite, pointed out nearly
four months ago, the entire char-
acter of the war has changed.
“The United States interwned in
South Vietnam with the ob-
jectivo of prcVenting its takeovr-r
by organized Communist powur
based locally in Hanoi and sup-
ported by Moscow arid Peking.
'l'hc U.S. opposed the takeovr-r
(a) because it was judged to
endanger major US. interests
and, ultimately, global peace and
stability; (b) because the U.S. is
against the forcible imposition
of a rr-gimc on a people or
nation counter to their own Will.
(c) because in the case of lndii
China the U.S. had specific
treaty commitments as Well as
implicit obligations from its role
as victor in the war against
Japan. 'l‘hese considerations,
which motivated and justified
the geopolitical objective,
seemed and seem to me con<
vincing.

“Now, however, the President,
ail commander in chief and chief
executive, has abandoned the
objective. Moreover, by his [en-
thusiastic cooperation with
lluiuiia and China] he has alien
doned the political and moral
considerationc that justiﬁed the
objective. To exchange lulaome

toast: with Chou and Brezhnev

at the same time that you are
dropping square miles of bombs
on junior camp followers of
Chou and Brezhnev is a political
contradiction and a moral of-
fense.

“When ﬁghting no longer has
political meaning, it becomes
butchery. Commenting on Presi-
dent Roosevelt's failure to bring
the war with Japan to a close
following the battle of Leyte
Gulf, General J.F.C. Fuller
writes: ‘What the scalpel is to
.the surgeon, war should be to
the statesman, and whatever the
causes of the war may he, should
the aim of the stateman be
purely destructive, then the ricti»
vities of the soldier will become
those ol‘ the slaughterllousc...'l‘o
be a sane political instrument,
war demands a sane political
end, and to he attainable that
and must be strategically possi-
lilc.‘

"In the present case it is not
necessary to discuss whether the
end is or was...str:itegically possi-
ble. Since the end to which the
military action was the means
has been renounced, it is now
irrelevant. "l'he game is lost in
Vietnam,' Servan-Schreiber sums
up. ‘Il.'s time to mm.”

The President has, by now,
resigned himself to this, Stewart
Alsop, in his Newsweek column
(May 22) ertt‘h“ "For more
than a year now, the President
has been askng from the North
Vietnamese only a triiiiiilucr-nt
fig-loaf to cover ii tolal American
withdrawal from lndochina. Ilc
has been asking for all agreed
exit that could be made to loolt,
if not exactly honorable, at least
not downright iiidt‘ccntf' It ap-
pears the war will be over short-
ly regardless of who wins in
Novamber. The American sur-
render in Indochina was drawn
up four years ago and its too late
to change course now.

Environmental Bond Issue on Nov. Ballot

Vote to Clear
the Water

Your air, water, and land are at stake this November 7.
The environmental bond issue, $1.15 billion in funds for
environmental projects, is on the ballot.

The bond issue must be passed. The Pure Waters bond
issue of 1965 is running dry. More money is nccdcd for
projects that will be increasingly expensive if delayed any
longer.

The bond issue covcrs air, water, and land:

» $650 million towards ncw sewage treatment facilities,

«$150 million for fighting air pollution from schools.
hospitals, and municipal incinerators, '

$175 million to help communities begin recycling [llL'Il‘
solid wastes: and

v $175 million to acquire park lands, wetlands, and other
unique lands. ‘ ‘

Tlic moncy is for local use in your own towns and Clllt's.
Municipalitics and the federal government will provrdc
matching funds; thc expenditures will soar past tlic $1.15
billion provided in tlic bond issuc.

'l‘lic bond issuc .i'lltJllltl pass, if pcoplc arc as cnviroii
mentally conccrncd as they sccin. But dozcns of citizens"
groups that arc now campaigning for your vote lt-gir
:ipiirliy. 'l‘licir message is, in part. to go to the polls and
look for thc issuc on the ballot. Don't assume it Will pass
automatically.

There is popular rcscntnicnt against any big cxpcndi
turcs. But voting down this bond issue would he .in
economic blunder. It is goingI to cost a lot more than ill . l 3
billion to protect rind rcstorc our state's ciivironnicnt. 'l‘lic
bond issuc is a crucial, but small downpayrncnt, on an

"If One Condones War,
One Cannot Curse
Terrorism"

To the Editor:

I was amused by Mitchell
Frost’s analysis of fanatics and
terrorists (September 8, 1972),
especially by his suggestion that
Israel invade Syria and Lebanon.

Mr. Frost’s complaint appears
to be that terrorists are not
governments. Governments can
destroy human life in wholesale
lots and escape punishment.
Governments can decide who is
dangerous (or who might be)
and take immediate action;
people cannot.

Doesn’t Mr. Frost realize that
terrorism is simply “individual
initiative” applied to war(which
“every civilized society" engages
in sooner or later)? How can a
conservative hold briefs for the
actions of the collectivists in
government and condemn the
highest expression of individu—
alism—the right to kill one’s en-
emies?

One cannot have it bothrwayn.
If Mr. Front wishes to condemn
terrorism, he cannot endorse it.
If a sniper who is a law unto
himself is anathema, so is the
government, so is the society
which uses B—52's to destroy its
enemies or the enemies of its
friends.

If one condones war, one must
not curse terrorism. The terrorist
lacks the muscle of a civilized
society but his morality is no
worse nor even any different.

When Mr. Frost is ready to
execrate the President of the
United States and any other
leader who engages in massive
acts of terrorism, 1 will be wil-
ling to listen to denunciations of
less powerful killers.

Yours truly,
Lester Heuerling

ASP "Faggotales" Unfair
to Gays on Campus

To The Editor:

We, as members of the gay
community on campus, wish to
take this opportuhity to state
our objection to the irrespon
sibility demonstrated by the
Albany Student Press in pre-
senting the article “Faggotales”
in the Friday issue, dated
September 22, 1972.

The ASP, as the official stu-
dent newspaper, has shown cx-
traordinary carelessness in not
even printing a byline in an
article of comment. This news-
paper has a certain responsibility
to the University community,
including its gay members, It is
painfully evident that, without a
byline, the typical reader will
associate the article with the
opinions of the uniVersity gay
community. We demand that the
ASP iichr again present a gay
article of comment to the Uni»
versity without a byline.

We object particularly to the
ASP publishing an article that

bandies about the pejorative
label “faggot.” The ASP would
not present articles about other
minority groups on campus
using the common and highly
offensive put-downs associated
with Blacks, Jews, Puerto
Ricans, Women, etc... Further-
more, thc ASP would not treat
any of these communities on
campus with the apparent lack
of concern with which it treats
the interests of the gay com-
munity. As Student Tax payers,
we object most strenuously to the
offhand treatment we have re—
ceived.

In the future, we expect the
Albany Student Press to exercise its
journalistic responsibility with
more care, and we will take
appropriate actions to insure this
end.

To the SUNY Community:

There have been several pro
jecur in Albany aiming at the
reform of prisons and parts of
the judicial process (which are
systematically discriminatory,
therefore .unjult.). One of the
most recent, a half-way house,
is prospectively a fantastic pro
gram. Known as the Garnet
House. located on First St. in
Albany, it will serve as a home
and growing center for people
whose societal mighed roles and
lifestyles haile led them to be
victims of our prisons (sup-
posedly rehabilitation centers).
This could lead us into a terribly
rhetorical or completely esoteric
discussion of anything from the

P.0.W.-M.I.A.

To the SUNYA Community:

From talking to various people
I've found that few of those
wearing P.O.W. - M.I.A. bracelets
realize they can write to the
families of the men whose names
they wear. To do so simply
address the letters: “To the
family of" followed by the
man's rank and name and send it
to V.l.V.A.; they'll forward the
letters.

For those unaware of P.O.W. —
M.I.A bracelets, here's the infor-
mation. By sending to V.l.V.A.
(Voices in Vital America) you
may request either a nickel
($2.50) or copper ($3.00) brace-
let inscribed with the soldier's
name, rank, and date of loss. It
is to be worn until the Red Cross
is allowed to see the prisoner
and can assure his family of his
status and humane treatment.

The bracclct's importance is
varied. First, in writing to the
family the wearer may give them
some comfort in knowing some
one, a total stranger, is cori-
cerned for their son's or hus-
band's welfare.

Secondly, by allowing others
to see the bracelet and ask aborit
it, people are constantly re»
minded of our prisoners of war
and men missing in action.
Hopefully, this is one way to
prevent their becoming a forgot-
ten group of men.

'I‘hird, for one's own self v in
the middle of a seemingly awful
problem, just seeing the bracelet
is a reminder of how lucky we
all really are merely by being
alive and well.

Fourth, the bracelet transcends
political ideologies in these Ite-
publican- Democratic times. It is
an expression of concern for one
human being from another, out
side the realm of man-made poli-
tical systems.

Good Day!

To lllt' Editor

In reading the Sept. 8 ASP,l
noted that Jack Anderson's col-
umn will be appearing in the
Friday issues. Good!

In one of his columns he
wrote: “One of the least likely
men in America to shoot a prmi
dent or seek to overthrow the
govenment is Paul Harvey, the
voice of the status quo. Yet the
Secret Service considers him a
menace to the Prcnldent because
he'onco climbed over a security

Mr. Lester l‘leverling, whose

ting to governments the right to

dual who wants something from
another be prohibited from
using force to get it. He cannot
hold up his neighbor at gun
point to steal his money. If he
does, government is granted the
right to use this very same force,
through the police and the
courts, to punish him. Such
force in the hands of govern-
ment has been legitimized by
tradition I

On the international sphere a
similar rule applies. Countries,
under international law, are pro-
hibited from using force (waging
war) for some nationalistic gain.
Wars of aggression are not al-
lowed on an international scale.
As laws are necessary on a na-
tional scale, so they are neces-
sary on an international scale. As
dieyare enforced through the use
of legitimate force on the na-
tional scale, so defensive wars
are generally recognized as legiti-
mate means of rebuking an ag-
gressive war-making country.
This is precisely the nature of

our involvement in Vietnam. If
Syria and Lebanon do not con-
trol the terrorists who attack

Israeli citizens within their own
countries, than Israel is certainly
within her rights to defend her-
self from such attacks throuﬂi
the waging of a defensive war
against the countries responsible.
The contradiction does not hold.
