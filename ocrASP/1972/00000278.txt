 

“There's just a little bit of
magic in the country music that
we’re playin’," sing POCO’s les-
der, Richie Foray, and indeed
‘there was. Furay's bouncy en-
thusiasm, Rusty Young‘s jumpy
steel guitar, Tim Schmitt's solid
bass and the talents of drum-
mer George Grantham and gut-
tarist Paul Cotton (who replaced
Jimmy Messina) mixed into one
magical whole the last time they
were up this way—almost two
years ago at the Union Chapd.

With any luck, they will again
Saturday nite at the SUNYA
gym. We’d be less than honest,
though, if we didn’t note that
the band hasn't exactly broken
any new ground in the past two
years, and that more than a few
of their shows in that interval
have been marred by a very
harsh, unbalanced sound system.
All-Audio sound of Boston is
handling Saturday’s show, and
they are one of the best, so let’s
hope that the magic will work
again. If it doesn’t, the Concert
Board’s advertising slogan, “You
asked for it," may take on can-
notations that the Board might
not have intended.

Folk Dance: lip 8. Kicking

marrow from the gym every
Thursday night from 6:00 to
8:30 as SUNYA’s International
Folk Dance Club conducts its
weekly session. The club, under
the direction of folk dance en-
thusiast and SUNYA senior
Debbie Bayley, is a place where
both novices and experts in the
art of folk dance learn, teach,
practice and socialize.

Members of the club also per-
form in the Albany area; the
group's ﬁrst engagement this
semester will be at Hudson
Valley Community College's
Festival of Nations on October
29

According to Debbie, folk
dancing got its start as a social
activity in the United States in
the 1930's, when Vyts Beliajus,
a Lithuanian, emigrated to
America and started folk dance
groups all over the country.
There are several groups in Al—
bany. The one here at the Uni-
versity draws about thirty partie
cipants a week, from Renssalear
and the community as well as
from the student body.

Harlol opened with a few
really good songs, among them
“Slave Boogie" and "Midnight
Rider," their own compositions.
They aren't a large band, but
they all played well, especially
the twelve-string and lead gui»
tars.

The vocals in Hurlo! were fair,
but by no means outstanding.
The drumming was good, and
the organ was good, but not too
noticeable in this part of the
concert. Ilarlol did another
song, “Built for Comfort,"
which was a very good song with
a strong beat, probably their
best for the night.

After a few minutes, .lum I"ur‘

COME SEE THE HANGINGI

 

 

 

In addition to regular groups,
folk dance camps and work-
shops, where experts in the field
teach and introduce new dances,
meet periodically. Debbie notes
that while folk dancing exists all
over the United States, it has
practically disappeared from the
peasant societies where it orig-
inated, and where the radio has
now replaced folk expression
with rock and roll.

Debbie’s background in folk
dance includes a year‘ she spent
on Cyprus researching authentic
folk dances (quickly before they
disappear). She also has taught
folk dance at the Albany Jewish
Community Center, and she as-
sistant teaches the folk dance
course that is in the University’s
physical education curriculum.

Debbie teaches mainly dances
from Eastern Europe and the
Middle East. She says that
dances from Serbia, is part of
Yugoslavia, are very popular.
“Yugoslavia has a different
style-nervous. People seem to
like Serbian dancing. Everybody
likes to bounce around."

Right now the group is also
trying out a few English dances,
which they will perform at their
Hudson Valley engagement on
October 29.

- Great Sound

though they’re obviously not as
well know they're probably
just as goo , if not better. Con-
sisting of seven regular musi‘
cians, specifically band members
on lead guitar, organvocals,
drums, trombone, trumpet, bass
and rhythm guitars, this group
achieved one of the best sounds
heard from a non-“super‘group”
in along time. (The members are
Marc Hoffman, Gene McCor-
mick, Joe English, Earl Ford,
Steve Marcone, Kent Dchlicc,
and Jerry Sorn, respectively in
order of their instruments listed
above.) The band had with them
two musicians sitting in, Sam
Brook on sax, and ltogcr Madi-
son on Conga drums. 'l‘hcy
plnyctl several songs, all out-
standing, cspecially good
though, were “Talk is Cheap,"
and “Everybody Wants to be a
Rock and lloll Star."

A few minutes after .luni I"uc

poinlmcnt throughout Llil‘
audience, because they had i-n-

They began with “Early in tho-

songs, iioiic really fine, except
for one in which the I)ilhb' player

Gridders Rush To Victory '

by Mike Igoe

The ground game was the or-
der of the day Saturday as the
Albany State football club
dumped Stony Brook, 14-0.

Carvin Payne, Lonnie Davis,
and Marvin Perry were the key
men as the Great Danes racked
up 271 rushing yards. In fact,
the running game was so effect-
ive that quarterback John Ber-
tuzzi attempted only four pas-
ses, all of which were in-
complete.

The Danes started to move
early in the game and took their

for a touchdown after 11 plays.

Those critics who immediately
ruled out Albany's chance in
the game because of the pre-
sence of freshmen in the starting
lineup should look at the per—
formance of Marvin Perry. Perry
netted 82 yards in 11 carries and
also scored the first touchdown.

Despite the strong ground
game, Albany was unable to put
any more points on the board
until the fourth quarter. Five lost
fumbles wiped out the chances
for further scoring. Then, in the

ﬁnal stanza, Lonnie Davis tallied
the clinching touchdown for
State.

The defensive unit which was
expected to carry the Danes also
had a good day despite some
sloppy play. The return of Jeff
O'Donnell to the safety spot

after a brief quarterbacking stint
was hidilighted by two into--
ceptions for the safetyman.

'I‘im Myers stopped a Stony
Brook drive by grabbing a piss
in the end zone and bringing it
back to the 37. In addition,
Frank Villanova had a hand in
numerous tackles.

Coach Bob Ford was pleased
with the victory but was a bit
annoyed with some of the mis-
haps of the contest. “Our off-
ense has made phenomenal
progress," noted the third year
pilot of the Gridders, “but those
fumbles really hurt!" “Bertuzzi
did a good job reading defenses,
though and our offense was able
to move the ball consistently for
a change."

Ford also expressed disap-
pointment with some of the
defensive work. “There were a
few plays when we had ﬁve or
six shots on tackles and We
still had a hard time. I hope we
can get these problem cleared
up because my scouters tell me

last Saturday at LeMoyne.

State won the first one, 4 to 3,
when 'I‘orry Kenny drovu homc

run in the top of the scvonth
inning. LeMoync took the night
cap, 4‘0 when Albany could
manage just three safeties
allowing the Dolphins to score
three runs, two of which were
unearned, in the first. inning.

Dan Deidorest to pinch hit. Dan
delivered the tieing run with a

second hit of the day, a double,
moved to third on Tom La-
vigne's sacri fice hunt, and scored
the winner on 'I‘erry Kenny’s

IoeMoync scored all the runs
