PUPS B UMBED 70-2

by Ralph Molir

Joe Murphy must have felt like
a duck in a shooting gallery as
the Albany JV soccer team
played host to Cobleskill in their
first regular season game last
Saturday. Joe, normally a fuIIA
back, took over as goalie for the
JV team when Rod Fortran was
injured early in the first half.
Despite his fine effort, Albany

was crushed 10-2.

The main culprit was (leorge
Sayward who scored 5 of the
opposition's goals. This star
freshman wa.. the spark of
Coblcskill and Albany could not
contain him.

The two Albany goals came
late in the second half when
Louise Gmtiro stunned the oppo-
sition as his bullet shot zoomed

Although playing well indivi-
dually, Albany lacked the co-
hesion necessary to display a
fine team effort. As they be-
come more experienced a great
improvement should be noticed.

REFS SPOIL

BOOTERS OPENER

by Nathan Salant

On Saturday afternoon, the
Albany Soccer team opened
their season on an unhappy foot,
losing to Geneseo, 4-0. Albany's
hooters played two different
games; a very poor first half due
to lack of aggressiveness, and an
excellent second half due to a
totally different aggressive, fight-
ing style of play. You would not
have believed that the same team
played both halves, and contin-
ued to battle despite a three goal
deficit of which none should
ever have scored. One was accid-
entally scored via a defensive
crossup, and the other two
thanks to the referees.

The opening minutes of the
first half showed Albany’s boot-
ers afraid to go out and play
offense. They seemed to hold
back; fearing making a mistake
and allowing a Geneseo break-
away. Wings were playing as if
they were halfbaeks, halfbacks
as fullbacks, and fullbacks even
closer to the goal. This resulted
in a spotty offense, and three
Geneseo goals, the first scoring
at 10:20 on a IO footer by
center inside Ed Usinger. Usingcr
scored again several minutes later
on a fluke goal that rolled in
just out of the reach of goalie
Henry Obwald who was partially
screened on the play. On the
opening kickoff following the
goal, Albany made a sudden rush
at Geneseo but failed to score
when Alvarez's shot hit the
crossbar.

At 32:05, the first questv
ionable play occurred after a
corner kick by Geneseo. A shot
on goal was taken, and goalie
Henry Obwald reached back to
his right to make what appeared
to be a beautiful, one hand save,

only to have the referee signal
goal. He claimed that the ball
had crossed the line in the air,
and that Henry had merely bat-
ted it out afterwards. The en»
suing argument was to no avail,
and the score was 3-0 as the half
ended. This reporter was there,
and cannot help but wonder
how the ref could have seen the
play, considering he was out of
pesition - to the right and rear of
the goal mouth, and screened by
several players. He probably did
not see it, but being a loyal
Gencseo resident, he saw
through the wall of players well
enough to call it a goal.

In the second half, Albany
came out like bats out of hell.
The Danes brought the game to
Geneseo, missing several scoring
opportunities by some nice de-
fensive work by Genesco’s full-
backs. Then, at 3:35, a Geneseo
breakaway was broken up by a
sliding tackle by fullback Bruce
Michaela. To Albany's conste-
rnation, the ref called a penalty
shot. The sliding tackle is legal,
providing the tackler makes con-
tact with the ball. The ref
claimed Bruce never touched it.
I wonder! The penalty shot was
made, as are most of this type,
and this put the game out of
reach.

The Danes continued to battle
on, outshooting Geneseo 10-8 in
the second half, but to no avail.
Final score---Geneseo 4, Albany

Although the loss was a huge
disappointment, the players have
not lost faith in themselves. Cap~
tain Larry Herzog summed it up,
"Sure we’re disappointed and it
was a tough loss. But we're not
going to get down on ourselves.
We’re going to beat Hamilton
this Wednesday and we’ll be
coming home at .500."

Albany State avenged last
year’s defeat at the hands of
rMontcclair State by walloping
them and Coast Guard in a home
cmwcountry meet last Satur-
day. The score of the meat,
which was the fastest in Al-
bany's history, shows Albany's
complete domination. Albany
had 24 points, Montclair State
66 points and Coast Guard had
60 pointc.

The Albany team which lacked
aggressiveness last week, came
right out from the start this
week. The first mile was run in
ﬁve minutes with only two
Montclair State runners being
able to stay with a pack of
Albany runners. At this point
Albany only had to hold posi-
tion to win even though the
Montclair State runners were
one-two.

As they broke into the clear
with only .9 miles to go Al-
bany’s Vinnie Roda was sand-
wiched between the Montclair
runners. Behind them there was
a sea of yellow as Albany had
seven of the next eight runners.

The Montclair runner, 'i'im
O'Donough held on to first with
Reda second and a Montcluir
runner third. Jim Schrader, Nick
Demarco, Bill Sorel and Carlo
Cherubino and John Koch took
the fourth through eighth spots.
Phil Doyle and Scott Aber-

Harriers Avengé

mmhia took tenth and ele-
venth. Except for Abercrombio
who won expected to start clow-
ly and John Stanton who ﬁn-
ished twenty all the Albany run-
ners broke twenty eight minutes,
an outstanding performance this
early in the season.

Coach Mumey was quite
pleased with the times by all the
runners. At the beginning of this
year’s training Mutiny slowed
down practice to prevent the
team from peaking too early in
the season as the SUNYAC
championship and the Albany
Invitational are late in the year.
Even with the runners about ten
days behind in training as com-
pared to last year, their times are
three to four meets ahead of last
year.

For Vinnie Reda this was the
second time he has led the Alv
bany team. Though he has not
won a race, it took a super effort
by the Montclair runner to win.
It was the first time that three
runners had broken 27 minutes
in a race at Albany.

The most pleasant surprise was
Nick DeMaI'cowho ﬁnished fifth.
Nick had an off meet last week
but came back with a strong
performance. He shownd no sign
of the injuries that kept him out
last year.

Next Saturday Albany takes
on its toughest opponent, Army.
It is going to take a super effort
to beat Army.
