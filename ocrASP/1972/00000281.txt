Ms. Arlene Emery Brown is a
graduate student at SUNY Al-
bany in anthropology. Aside
from carrying out her graduate
work however, Ms. Brown is the
Upstate Coordinator for the
Coalition for a Free Choice. She
works part time in Albany at the-
new office that the Coalition
just opened on Washington
Avenue. ‘

The Coalition is a political
action organization which was
started last spring in response to
what Brown terms, “a near disas-
ter" in regard to the New York
State Abdrtion Law. Last spring
the abortion bill was repealed by
the New York State Legislature,
and the repeal then vetoed by
Governor Rockefeller. The Coa-
lition was formed with the speci-
fic intent of saving the abortion
law.

According to Brown, the Coav
lition is different from other
abortion organizations in that it
is purely a political action group.
That is to say, it is not an
abortion agency, a birth control
agency, or any type of environ-
mental agency. Brown's objec-
tive is to “coordinate the efforts
of group and individuals who
want to preserve the present
abortion law." The abortion law
is the only issue of the Coalition.

The Coalition, in that it is only
a political action group whose

 

Pro-

aim is to work through the
legislative processes, has pre-
viously worked primarily in the
downstate area, where it has
made contributions, through
funding and volunteer efforts, to
the primary campaigns of state
legislators of both parties who

'voted against last spring’s abor-

tidn repeal bill. The Coalition
has done much to help save the
abortion law. To raise such
funds was the first act of the
Coalition when it was formed.
And the organization will con-
tinue its campaign efforts
throughout the state in the up-
coming elections in trying to get
its pro-abortion candidates clec~
ted or those candidates running
with right to life candidates
against them. Brown emphasizes
the need the Coalition has, es-
pecially with the election so
close at hand, to get its pro-
abortion law legislators into
office. The way she explains it is
like this: that ifPresident Nixon
wins another term of office,
there is a strong possibility that
he will appoint Gov. Rockefeller
to a position in Washington. If
this occurs, Lt. Gov. Malcolm
Wilson will be taking (iov.
Rockefeller‘s place.

According to Browu, Li (iov
Wilson is a staunch champion of
right to life, and unless there are
legislators in the assembly to
counteract him, there is the
chance that the repeal of the

odlitian: L a
Abortion ‘

abortion law will go through.
'Brown urges volunteers to
work for pro-abortion law legis-
lators. In the Albany area, she
suggested working for Mary Ann
Krupsak, currently an Assem-
blywoman who is running for
the New York State Senate from
Amsterdam. Brown says that
those interested in working for
Mary Ann Krupsak may contact
Brown.

After the coming elections,
according to Brown, efforts will
be put forth to organize people
to lobby on a local level and to
also get a professional lobbyist
to work in Albany. Further-
more, shc says, some work will
be done for public education in
terms of motivating people to
work for the law. They shoud
write to their legislators, and
apply pressure to counteract the
right to life groups.

Brown is also involved in set-
ting up chapters of the Coalition
in major upstate cities, such as
Syracuse, Rochester, and Buf-
fate, in smaller towns, such as
Watertown, and also here in the
'I‘ri-City Capitol District.

For the purpose of setting up a
chapter for Albany area there
will be an organizational meeting
Saturday, October 14, from ll
A.M. to 1 RM. at the First
Presbyterian Church located at
the corner of Willet and State
Streets downtown, Brown em-
phasized that anyone who is

 

  
     
   
   
   
     

 
 

 
 

     

  

   

  

    
 

interested in the organization
should come, as officers will be
elected. Many volunteers are
needed to work in the office and
to form committees. The com-
mittees will take care of various
actions such as publishing a
newsletter, leaﬂetting and get-
ting exposure on the various
media. The Albany chapter of
the Coalition will be working
out of the same office that
Brown, as Upstate coordinator,
is now working out of on Wash-
ington Ave.

Also invited to attend the or-

ganizational meeting were the
women‘s liberation groups from
the Albany area, including the
SUNYA Women's Liberation
Group, the men's liberation
groups, and the public action
groups of various churches in the
area, and groups such as ZPG
and PYE. Volunteers are also
needed to work as day care
helpers during the organizational
meeting to serve those who
come with small children.

Students. Service the Community"?

by David Lerner

In accordance with the new
edict issued from the Admini-
stration ordering a public rela-
tions facelift for the SUNYA
campus, it is hoped that a few
hundred gallons of paint will
provide the panacea in strength-
ening relations between Campus
and Community. It's been sug-
gested, however, that their reme-
dies for poor community rela-
tions are misdirected—not an un-
common occurrence today.

The real cure, first of all, is
free. Second, it is of beneficial
service to the community as well
as the campus, and third, it is
not so obvious it ruse as putting
a suit on a derelict to make him
look presentable. The cure is in
LCD 30A next to University
College and has been waiting for
its due recognition for two
years, and it's called “Com-
munity Service."

Community Service has been
actively involved in aiding phil-
anthropic organizations such as
The Albany Association for the
Blind; Headstart, The Urban
League, and The Senior Citizens
Bureau, to name four of the ISO
agencies it serves. It also supplies

volunteers to the Capitol, but
how charitable that is will have
to wait discussion for another
time.

Community Service is a three
credit course open to anyone
except freshmen for a maximum
of two semesters. Its specific
function is referring interested
volunteers to any one of its 130
participating organizations.
Everyone taking the course is
required to put in six hours a
week at his or her agency. There
is a lot of freedom in the selec-
tion of the agency and it is
assumed that the person would
want to work at least those six
hours since they chose it in the
first place. Over 2,000 SUNYA
students have participated in the
program, logging over 150,000
volunteer hours ranging from tu-
toring drop-outs, manning
switchboards, conducting sur-
veys, teaching photography to
ghetto kids, helping out in hospi-
tal emergency wards, in short,
there is nothing that can't be
done if you have the time to
Volunteer.

Along with the six hours, a
short paper is required outlining
the type of work done, the
history and structure of the
agency, the relevance, or lack of

it, to the student’s expressed
academic goals and ambitions,
and overall impressions of serv-
ing the community. There is also
one mandatory evaluation ses-
sion during the first semester.
No experience in volunteer work
is needed, not that any of the
agencies expect any. All that is
wanted is reliability and punctu-
ality.

Freshmen may volunteer. In
fact, Mrs. McKinley, Director of
the program, emphasizes that
freshmen are especially encour-
aged to volunteer (only not for
credit). They need not write a
paper, attend that session, not
put in a minimum six hours
though they are free to do so. It
seems that there are never
enough volunteers to do the job
that needs to be done, which by
the way, does not include paint-
ing Dutch Quad.

Community Service will be
busy recruiting new volunteers
on Community Day, October
23, as well as showing a special
Community Service film while
the Administration will be show-
ing all the Visitors the freshly
painted Pool Room.

 

 

Henway‘s enters the new year with bright prospects.

Henwuy’s Grand Opening A Smash

by Judy Daymont

Enthusiasm, excitement, and
satisfaction were the sentiments
I ia' reigned supreme at
Henway's on the afternoon of
this year‘s grand opening last
Saturday, September 23, The
eagerness expressed during the
ASP interview by chway's
management ,was surpassed only
by the reception this unique and
truly co-opcrative Venture was
given by the students of Albany
State.

OVer 750 residents and friends
poured into the “Heart of Indian
Quad" and‘listened, drank and
danced to the music of “Skin "
The following iiight‘s criter-
taiiiment, much to the delight of
Henway's patrons, was the folk
milU'ilIl' of John Simpson.

How, do you t k, will this

service be able to escape the fate
of the Bookstore and Rath-
skeller'.’ The ansWer is simple,
F.S.A. will not run chway's,
but instead take a truly advisory
position on its Board of Direcl
tors. In tact, what has been
F.S.A.'s role? “(F.SA.) has
helped us in any way we want-
ed," explained Brad Allen, co-
manager,

In essence there is no con-
ceivable way that chway‘s
could have opened without be»
coming part of F.S.A. According
to state law, a liquor license
could otherwise, iichr have been
obtained. The $5,000 debt ac-
cumulated was taken over by
F.S.A. and no stops have been
placed on bids for improvements
or innovations within the limits
of good busint ‘ practices.

 

ALBANY STATE CINEMA

 

The money story is as follows:
The $.50 cover charge pays for
the live entertainment and one
free beer, or coffee and dough-
nut. The $.25 charge for beer
and soda cow-rs, in addition to
the price of the beverage, the
cost of the free food, supplies,
overhead, and payroll. All sub-
sequent profits arc put directly
back into Henway‘s and used for
improvements and payment of
their debt.

An F.S.A. bookkeeper will
balance the books, take care of
receipts and registers. No cut
will be taken out for admini-
strative costs, It is estimated that
it will take ill [casl three years to
clear the debt As to what hap
pens Wllil the profits their, it can
not be determined.

The ralioiiiile of the existence
of lli-iiway's is perhaps chs~
tinned and argued by some, but
it is seen as crystal clear to those
involved with its production. In
a nutshell Il fills the gap in the
university‘s need for high

quality, inexpensive, varied and
convenient entertainment. Not
only does it provide the service
of selling refreshments, but it
offers a place for social inter-
action, a requisite otherwise un
fulfilled by the Rathskeller and
Campus Center

The idea of ii complement to
our existing entertainment faci»
lities was initially proposed back
in the 1970-71 school year and
had its roots in a recommenda-
tion as early as 19636, Original
plans for the “Satellite Union,"
located it in Hill basement of
twu adjoining dorms on Indian
Quad Modeled closely after our
Campus (‘i-nlcr, the selling of
food, renting of recreational

equipment, and a place for stu»
dents in "go" wvrv its main
goals

IIUWPU‘I, it was not iinlil April
In, l$i7‘_‘ that llenway's opened
under lhc iiiziiiagcrial giiidciice
ol 'l'oiiy i'idiill and Rich Johnson
and the watchful eye of Bob
Brody. then dorm director. He

has left his mark indelibly im'
printed on Indian Quad, for not
only was he instrumental in the
realization of Henway's but it is
for his famous dog, that our
night club was named. They
were just about able to break
even last year, though by no
means was its lack of financial
prosperity due to lack of pa-
tronage.

Saturday and Sunday night
festivities are open to the SUNY
Albany students and their
guests. To discourage non-lini-
vcrsity persons, one must show
their Albany college I.D. upon
entering or be a guest of an
Albany student. In the latter's
case, proof of age is required to
i)l"'liJlL’ to purchase beer. If you
are a minor, and not a guest, a
college I.D likewise must be
presented, subsequently you will
not be able to buy liquor. AI-
tliough the price for beer, $.25,
is thc same as at the ltalhskcller,
there is popcorn and pretzels for
everyone at chway’s.
