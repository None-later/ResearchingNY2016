dispensing nothing more " 'hion

by l969 and the drunken,

the "Death of Hippie," it was all

A NIXON:

Washington AP — Negotiations
between presidential aide Henry
A. Kissinger and North Vietna-
mese diplomats have reached the
f‘very serious" stage and Kissin-
ger likely will return to Paris for
more talks next week, the Star-
NeWS reported today.

The newspaper quoted in-
formed sources as saying nego-
tiations have narrowed to the
point tlial the two sides are
bargaining over a political
formula for changing power in
Saigon.

It said the mechanism for set-
ting up a new government is to
be tied to the formula President
Nixon proposed May it for a
ccasc-fiic throughout Indochina
and the Withdrawal of American
hoops.

 

"We Will End the War"

Kissinger's latest meeting with
the North Vietnamese diplomats
in Paris ended after two days.
That round of talks followed an
I I‘day interlude. Previously,
talks between the Kissinger and
the North Victnamsc had been
more than ll days apart.

Both the White House and the
North Vietnamese have denied
that the two days of talks pro.
duccd a settlement of the Viet-
nam war.

llowcvcr, President Nixon told
an ttUdlCl"‘t‘ in Los Aiigclos Wed-
llCStlily mg I. "We have piepaicd
the South Victninnesc so that ii
is now very clcai that they Will
be able soon to undertake then
complete defense \vitliout oin
assistance We ate going to end
our involvement. We Will end the

war."

Nixon Neglects Nation
for the Military ,

During four years in office. President
Nixon has been preoccupied with summits
and confrontations. with the bombing of
North Vietnam and with ft'ttl‘ for thc dcfcat
of his protege. President 'l'hicu.

He has had little time or energy to spare for
the domestic concerns of American society.
He has allowed problems to fcstcr and grow
worse.

Because of this neglect. many Americans
have become disillusioned and have come to
believe our socicty is in an irreversible dc-
clinc. My own View is that on i' society is basic»
ally healthy and capable of self-renewal. Wc
might all be surpriscd to scc how readily
rcncwal could take place with an end to the
war and with a new. more responsible
national leadership under George McGovern.

Since the end of World War II, the United
States has spent more than one trillion. four
hundred billion dollars for military purposes.
Despite the rhetoric about reducing forciin
commitments and altering our national
priorities under the "Nixon Doctrine," the
Administration continues to place primary
emphasis on military expenditures.

Althouin Mr. Nixon said that his I972 and
1973 blttlgcts would allocate more for
“human resources" than for military pur-
poses. the military budget is increasing.
inflated by the costs ol the massive bombing
campaign in Vietnam. Assuming a continua.
tion of present policies. the Brookings Insti-
tiiiioii has lorccast a continuing increase in
defense spending which could reach about
$100 billion in l977.

The fact that wc are living beyond our
means 77 primarily because of extravagant
military costs —— is obfuscated by glowing
references to the GNP (gross national
product) and our so-callcd “trillion dollar
economy." Swept under tlic rug are such
salient but uncomfortable facts as that infla-
tion and the Federal budget deficits ——
amounting to about $125 billion during thc

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1972

  

.-. ,
four Nixon ycars ~ are prime contributors to
the overall GNP. Nor does the (NP take
account of an intern Hional balance-of-
paymcnts deficit of more than $30 billion in

The GNP is not a true measurc of useful
prtxluctivity; it is only a crude compilation of
money spctll for purposes ranging from steel
production to the publication of pornog-
raphy, from education to gambling. Iivcn the
increase in crime is a stimulus to the GNI’.
since we have to spend more on law enforce-
ment. ()n ilic other hand. the costs of pollu-
tion and a deteriorated environment are not
reflected in Ilic (iNl’. The National Urban
Coalition estimates air pollution costs at
$13.5 billion annually and water pollution
costs at $l2 billion annually. These are in.
cluded in the GNP only insofar as we try to
combat them and then they appear as part of
the “trillion dollar economy."

(‘oming down to earth. we encounter a
society deficient in education. transportation.
housing. health care. and community dcvcl—
opnient. During the same dccadc in which
our GNP has more than doubled. our cities
have deteriorated rapidly while Federal pro
grams designed to aid urban areas have been
starved for funds.

At the same time. the Nixon Administra-
tion insists we can well afford its rising mili~
tary expenditures. It is a travesty and an out-
ragc that here in the land of the "trillion
dollar economy" millions of our citizens can-
not afford and do not receive adequate health
care; riiillioiis of our children are denied ade-
quate education; millions of Americans are
forced to livc blighted lives in urban and rural
slums; and some Amcri 'ans even go hungry.

A reordering of our national priorities is
long overdue.

APermanent Change for the Good?

 

 

F. S. A.

Grows Responsive

FacultyStiidcnt Association has recently taken three
actions which indicate a deeper sensitivity to student needs
and a clearer awareness of its role in the community. We
applaud this incipient tendency and hope it results in
improved service to the campus in the long run.

l-lciiway's. Indian Qiiad's student pub. is one beneficiary
ol FSA‘s new .iititudc. It is difficult to obtain a beer
license in New York State. and especially so for a student
run operation. I‘SA generously provided chway's with
legal counsel and expedited its application. The Corpora
tion also contributed significant financial aid.

For several years, jewisli students have wanted to

establish a kosher kitclicii on campus. With the coopera-
tion of ITSA. one has finally been set up on Dutch Quad
this ycar. The corporation donach botli kttcltcn space and

til I .000 in funds.

Food Service has ill the past made

between purchasing union and

no. distinction

iioii~union lettuce.

Prompted by :in open letter to President liciiczct tScpt. 8
ASP, p. 9) which explained the plight of the migrant
worker and proposed a local boycott, Food Service joined

the nation wide effort.

For several years, the ASP and other media groups have

oblcctcd to I’SA's indifferent attitude towards the Lt)lll-

niiinity it serves. 'I‘licrc have been food strikes, cndlcss
talks, and .1 series of broken promises from FSA. Now FSA

is .ii last giving consideration to sttldL'tit complaints and

suggestions. There is still a lot wrong with [ltL' corporation:

considering the number of years it has been in [he rcd,
[here is no doubt it is in many ways badly managed. (Sec

front page).

The absurdly long lines students must put tip with in the

book store, the large losscstlic Patroon Kooiii suffers cacli

iiioiiili, and Illt' indifference wliicli Food Service slioWs its
student and ftlll'ilitlc' employees. all demonstrate the

corporation’s irresponsibility.

The Faculty Student Association has long been (leaf to
student complaints. Its i‘cccnt generosity towards Hen-

way's and the kosher kitchen, and also its boycott of

nonunion lettuce is, we hope, the beginning of a

permanent change for the good. But we remain (for now at

least) skeptical.
