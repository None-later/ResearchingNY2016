Young View of Washington

"Dear Senator...’

WASHINGTON—"Dear Sena-
tor,” the letter began. “What are
we going to do about porno-
graphy? It has even crept into
my favorite television programs,
and I'm so embarrassed. Please,
Senator, tell me what I can do
about pornography on TV."

The Senator‘s eyes ﬂashed mis-
chievously as he dictated one of
the shortest congressional res-
ponses on record: “Dear Mn-
dam: Turn it off. Sincerely,
Stephen M. Young, USS."

Until his retirement in 1970,
Stephen Young (ID—Ohio) was
known throughout the Senate
and indeed around the world for
his cryptic responses to consti-
tut-nts who wrote what be con-
sidcrcd stupid letters,

During his career Young, like
other rcprcscntiitchs of popu-
lous states, received thousands
of piccns of mail each Wiick. Asa
rcsult, stupid lettcrs were not
hard to come by, and Young’s
collection of replies is now con-
sidcrcd ( c (Onc of his favor
rites was “Dear Sir: Some idiot
is going around putting your
signature on insulting Il-ttcrs,
and l am advising you so that
you can Lakc steps to protcct
your good namc. ")

But Senator Young’s rcputa-
lion notwdhstanding, consti~
tuvnt mail is taken seriously by
most nicmbcrs of (.‘oiigrcs

liiuiiitioned and (I1‘Illll.l'(l, how
could you possibly find lbc luck

 

during a national political cam-
paign is as good a time as any to
let your officials know your
views.

There are a few simple do’s
and don't's which will make
your letters, telegram and
phone calls more effective.

First, letters. They should be
short and to the point, always
on one page and generally cover
ing no more than one subject.
Do expect a reply signed by
your representative but don‘t be
surprised if he personally never
sees either your letter or his
reply. Remember, legislators (Se-
nators especially) receive hun-
drcds and in some cases even
thousands of pieces of mail oath
day. To answer cach one per-
sonally would M an impossible
task. It should he cnough for
you to know that most li-gis-
lators vicw thcir mail as an im»
purtant haromctcr of public
opinion. As a rcsult, they pay
attention to it and your lcttcr
makcs its mark along with all thc
others.

'I'clegrams are often chn mori-
cffcctivc. For one thing, lhcir
cost forces you to bc concisc
and for anothcr the Sciiator will
rcalizr- you fclt strongly cnough
to makc an investment largi-r
than thc pricc of a stamp.

You should know that thcrc
arc spccial rates for telegrams to

to Senators or to other impor-
tant govarnment officials. While
a regular 16-word telegram mes-
sage would cost. $5.45, you can
wire your representative in
Washington a message of equal
length for $1.25 ($1.00 for tele-
grams to your state government
officials). Check with your local
Western Union office for details,
but in all cases remember to ask
for the special rates.

Telephone calls are acceptable,
but it's better to put your views
in writing. If you do telephone,
don‘t expect to speak to the
congl’éssrmn or Senator himself
Ask for one of his legislative

you money on both ends: for

Consciousness Raising

by Phyllis Hyman

“What should I wear tonight
Janey? I sure do want Frank to
be proud of me at the dance!”

"Darling," says Mother sweet-
ly, “don't you think it’s about
time that you get yourself a
man? You're not getting any
younger you know...."

“Boy what a life that guy has!
Twenty-six and a confirmed
bachelor - can’t beat that!”

Consciousness raising? "I'm
not oppressed," you might in-
sist. Well, maybe you‘re not. But
the more necessity of uttering
this cxprcssion would seem to
exaggerate its falsity. A group of
women living in the 4+2 dorm

shall we say, self-deception. We
havc formed a group, not for the
purpose of perpetuating female
sexism, but in ordcr to allow
women to discuss exactly what

realistic living situation.

We meet on a weekly basis in
trying to grow and change to-
gether. Our sessions have been
open and enlightening. Marriage
has been discussed - its many
facets being enumerated and ev-
aluated. Why is a woman in her
late twenties and unmarried con-
sidered an old maid and un-
doubtedly immensely lonely,
while a man in the same situa-
tion is considered a “free” bach-
elor who is really “living?” Is it
impossible for a woman to be
happy in her work or career
without the "help" of a man?
Family influece is a source of
much sex-role identification.
How many daughters have been
brainwashed into believing that
they must cultivate a certain
appeariincc in order to “catch a
man?” Any luck of a specific
physical atrributc placed a res—
ponsibility upon the woman to
mukc hcrself attractive. As far
back as we remember, it was
always the female who had to
make sure she wouldn't dirty
herself and always act in a “lady-
likc” manner. ’I‘hi- male could
play and tumble and be as rough
as hc wished. Ilcally, now, what
kind of frccdom is that? And
Ihi-si- arc thu type of roles that
HIV woman has accepted un-
