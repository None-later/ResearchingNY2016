“Marioe,” Hip Preacher

by Pam and Michael Rosenthal
Alternative Features Service

Marjoe's been preaching the
gospel since he was four years
old. We once saw his picture in
an ancient Life magazine. He
was six then, with peroxided
curls and little white cowboy
boots, performing a marriage
ceremony over a couple who
must have possessed either a
transcendent faith or a highly-
developed media-sense.

The name is derived from Mary
and Joseph, and Marjoe was the
hottest thing on the pentacostal
circuit for a decade. He suspects
that he earned about three
million dollars during those
years, though he never saw most
of it, his father having split with
the take. Abounding with out—
rageous details, Marjoe’s story
comes across as another gro—
tesque saga of person as pro-
duct, life as hype, slow death
through merchandizing.

But Marjoe endured. in his
mid-teens he refused to continue
preaching, instead bummed
around, living awhile with an
older woman whom he credits
for much of his sanity. He went
back to preaching on his own at
the age of twenty.

Now, some ten years later, he’s
sold his hustle to the movies,
featured in a documentary that
attempts to expose the Holy
Roller racket-- a film that’s a
portrait of the kind of show lny.
that allows pious America to got
it on and still be washed in LllI'
blood of the lamb.

The movie follows Murjol.‘ on
his last tour, through revival
tents and marble temples,
through the singing and the
stomping and the backstage
money-changing too. lntercul
are personal raps and con»
l'essions, and footage from Mar
joc's curly preaching years-1t
terrifying little automaton rccil-
ing hellfire by rate, but entirely
professional, Billy Graham
speedcd up to 78 rpm.

This documentary isn’t much
of an expose. The largely
simple-minded mmera loves to
zoom in on crisp ten and twenty
dollar bills, as though each
appearance of filthy lucre were a
sordid and shocking revelation.
There are also "serious" shots
(Marjoe contemplative) and
more zooms ( a lighted joint at a
New York party, to symboliZed
big-city sophistication,Coca Cola
at a pastor’s patio lunch, to
stand for Middle American
dreck.)

But. Marjoe endures this too.
For whatever his motives, sin-
cere self-purgation or a sharp
sense of where the real action is
(or more probably, some freak-
ed-out combination), he comes
through as an extraordinarily
talented, magnetic, sexy, and
even likeable showman. With his
Pierre Cardin suits and Mick
Jagger strut -- he's studied Jag-
ger, and puts the act. to better
use than we‘ve ever seen on the
rock and roll stage" Marjoe perv
forms miracles of audience in-
volvement. Middle-aged men and
women dance and sing. bubble in
tongues, and fall into quivering
orgasmic fits as they “meet Jesus
tonight."

There's still the hustle, though.

It's ironic too that filmmakers
from a generation that places
such a premium on self-ex-
pression, on actively getting it
on, should so need to distinguish
between us and them. Because,
in fact, it looks like they’re
getting their money's worth at
least as fully as most rock aud-
iences. Marjoe blesses, clasps,
grabs, touches his flock; If it’s
consumerism, it's a less alienated
brand of consumerism than we
saw among the unmoving,
glazed- eyed crowd on the hill at
Woodstock. And most import-
ant, Marjoe's people don't pay in
front. We plunk down our $4.50
or $5.50 to hear some watered-
down stompin' from Leon Russ-
ell, and it's just tough if we
don‘t. get it. on. Marjoe's can«
gregants don‘t pay until after the
Spirit hits them. At least they
get to try before they buy.

Luckily the unsympathetic
focus doesn't destroy the film,
perhaps because We’re made to
feel that Marjoe has experienced
some level of rapport and affect-
ion for his congregations. We
may be suckers for his line, just
like his little old ladies, but we
believed it when he said he
enjoyed getting people to loosen
up and have a good leﬂ”lhul
maybe he‘d still be in the
business if he could have cut. out
the hellfire and damnation parts.
And they do loosed up: the film
is most exciting when we see
people in ecstasy, shuddering
and crying, or smiling and hug-
ging. The spirit of Murioe's
people comes through despite all
odds.

"Mmjoe" is now showing at the
Hellman Colonic Center Theatre.
