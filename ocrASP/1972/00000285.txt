Experimental Theatre

David Epetein’l exciting play,
They Told Me That You Game
This Way, will be presented this
weekend, Sept. 29-Oct. 1, in the
PAC Arena ’llieatre u the first
major production of SUNYA's
Experimental Thmtre Group.

Somewhat ambiguous in con-
tut, the play concerns two
POW's thrown together in a pri-
son cell, pending execution, for
crimes unknown to the au-
dience. What we see developing
is an acute sense of fear mixed
with confusion and reverie as
Alex and Peter struggle to main-
tain sanity in the face of an
impending and inevitable death.
A strange comradeship develops
between the two: Alex-strongI
verbal and muscular-transposis
fear into hate and uses a fright~
cried and withdrawn Peter as his
only target. Indeed. both char-

acters alternate between a sense
of repulsion and contempt for
uch other, -andanineseainble
need for mutual reliance and
affection.

A double cast will present
They Told Me this weekend:
Joseph Ritter (Alex) and Keith
Smith (Peter) in one cast; Gerald
Faber (Alex) and M. Lawrence
Brown (Peter) in the other. Each
cast will alternate the perfor-
mances on Friday at 4 pm, 7:30
pm 8: 9 pm; Saturday and Sun-
day at 7:30 pm & 9 pm. Admis-
sion is free but tickets for the

' show must be picked up at the

box office a half hour before
curtain time.

The actors have matured their
given roles under the fine super-
vision ol' Dr. James Leonard,
director. E. Trelease is stage
manager and Joe Riley is de-

Suddenly, it's advertised all
across the hi-fi storefront in big
bold banners. “Come in and hcar
itI yes. we have four-channel
sound!“ What is all this that we
hear going on the contemporary
hi-l'i music scene‘.’ To answer the
question of what this new deve-
Iopmcnt in recorded sound en-
tails, I think it may prove hclp-
ful if we take a brief look back
at the history of multi-channcl
audio technology.

In one sense there is nothing
new about four-channel sound.
The use of several channels for
stem rind/or spatial sound crr
huneement goes back many
years and includes such well-
known rind inspired efforts as
the sound track for Walt Dis
ney's “Fantasia,” “The Robe"
and other films. 'l‘hosc fortuntc
enough, for instance, to see
“From Here to Eternity" in a
large movie bousc may recall thr-
drill field scene when the sound
suddenly came from all parts of
the theater. The movies, there-
fore, promoted some of the first
early experiments in the use of
multichannel audio for enter-
tainmi-nt reproduction, and it is
sad to see that today this aspect
of experimentation and IllanIl'
tiori in movie audio has been
neglected iii favor of experi-
menting with wider screen sys-
tems such as cincrama and so
forth. (It indeed looks like the
use of three—dimensional audio
in the movies has gone the way
of the three-dimensional film it-
self a castaway from the early
fifties.)

What is new about niulti-
channel today iii that it is being
offered as a home-listening sys-
tem for the first time »— as it
relates to music in that two
additional channels are added to
the stereo pair, the resulting four
channels being designated as left-

This weekend’s performance of
They Told Me That You Game
This Way should prove highly
stimulative, keenly emotional,
and, certainly, more food for
thought. ,

SUNYA’s Experimental
Theatre group will hold audi-
tions next week for its second
major production, Gallows Hu-
mor. Written by Jack Richard-
son, it is a play in two parts
which explores both an execu-
tioner’s funny, yet sad home
life, and a condemned man's last
blissful hours of life; it is a
humorous play. James Leonard
will direct the show which will
be presented Nov. 15-18 at 8:30
pm and Nov. 19 at 2:30 pm in
the Studio Theatre. Auditions
will be held Oct. 2, 3. 4 at 7:30
pm in the Studio Theatre.

Ill lllc “surround-sound" type
of l'our-charincl reproduction.
the basic idea is to surround lhc

the drums in the center-rear. .r
horn in I'roiil-Icl'l or bass in llic
right-rear channel. While this
form of “surrourid-sound" r'c
production rarely makes claim
for a l'acsiiiiilr- reproduction of
reality. it docs tend to iiicri-rrsc .i
lrslcni-r's perceptions of a musr
cal piccc and (you can't vcr'y
wr-Il ignore musical sound when
you are literally surrounded by
it) tlrcri-l'orc this lypc of four
cliriiincl reproduction has found
its greatest advocate In the pop
and rock music field.

The second type of Ioiir
cliriiinel reproduction, which Wc
may call "ambit-nee rcpro-
ductiori," provides perhaps lhc
most valid use of the quad-
ri-cordirig method in that it at
lulnpta to provide thosc slime
sonic impressions that one
would havu if one were at ri live
concert. By placing microphones
at strategic locations at. the rear
of u concert hall we are able to
pick up those subtle nuances of
musical reflection that add the
warmth and intimacy that we all
mociatc with Li live musical

hell. by combining this retir—

primary information being
played by the musicians on the

possible to capture an accurate

Changes in Ticket Policy

With the upcoming Poco concert, the University Concert Board is

initiating a new ticket selling policy. For 'the first time. Concert
Board will permit students the option of buying reserved tickets.
This change in policy necessitates a different procedure for

concert- goers. Whether reserved tickets are an innovation students
want ls still moot. However, Concert Board is attempting the
experiment for the beneﬁt of concert-goers, and the Paco concert

will determine its merits.

The doors for the reserved tickets will open at 9:00, at the rear of
the gym building (the side facing the track). The doors for general
admission tickets will open at 9:15 in the front of the gym (the side
