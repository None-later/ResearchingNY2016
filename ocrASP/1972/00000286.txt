Security problems in Alden
and Waterbury Hallsdominated
the discussion as the Walden
Council held its first meeting of
the year of Monday, September
25 in the Waterbury Lounge.

Alden Hall especially has been
plagued by a high rate of crime
this year, culminating in a stu-
dent's room being robbed at
knifepoint on the night before
the men's

newcomers»:   norms

Suggestions offered. at: the”
meeting included beefing up
Alumni Quad’s soon-to-start Stu-
dent Security Patrol, putting
locloboxes on' all outside doors
and keeping them locked aftera
certain hour (they are theo-
retically kept locked after eleven
p.m. now), getting the SUNYA
Police to walk through the two
balls nightly rather than drive
past, and the stationing of a
SUNYA policeman on the quad
at all times every night. Dorm

informed the Council that origi-
nally a University police ofﬁcer
was to be stationed downtown,
but that the funds for this ofﬁ-
cer have since been eliminated.

A Security Committee was
formed to pursue the matter
further.

Also discussed was a proposal
to start a movie series on Alumni
Quad. Educational Committee
Cochairmen Mike McGuire and
Brent Kigneruclaimed that a film
catalog they had received offer-
ed recent ﬁlms at low prices, and
that the Council could break
even or possibly make a proﬁt if
they charged 50c admission. A
downtown series would have the
advantage of saving downtown
residents the trip uptown to see
a movie. The movies would be
scheduled so that they would
not. conflict with the uptowu
film series sponsored by Albany
State Cinema, Tower East Cine-
ma, and the International Film
Group.

In other Council business, new-
ly elected Council President Ira
Birnbaum asked for the creation
of a committee to revamp the
Walden Association Consti-
tution. Among its deficiencies,
he said, was its lack of any
procedure to amend the consti-
tution. A committee was set up
to redraw the Constitution.

Henway‘s has come a way
from last year, and the prospects
its managers see are that much

i more fantastic. It is hoped that

it will be open Thursday and
Friday as well as Saturday
(8:30-1:30) and Sunday
(823011230) nights. When this
occurs Friday will be designated
as folk night, Saturday as rock,
with Thursday and Sunday open
to Varied and diversified enter-
tainment. The hours to be open
will rest on the participation of
the student community.

The question of the type of
liquor to be served also relies
greatly on the tastes of the
constituents, as well as economic
feasibility. Where a beer permit
costs $300 a year, a beer and
wine license goes at a cost of
$1,300. Although no commit-
ment can be made as yet, if
sufficient interest is shown in
wine, according to Rick Gins-
berg, the added cost will not be
a factor. As of now, Henway’s is
operating on a daily permit basis
of $20 a night.

Deﬁnitely the most significant
of the proposals for Henway‘s is
the inducement of full student
participation. This extends l'ur-

tner than just offering your ser-
vices, but a genuine part'in its
management. Brad Allen, Rick
Ginsberg, and Mike Siembieda
are the student operating man-
agers and are paid by the hour
furl their services, along with
their staff. They all are vehe-
mently opposed, however, to
Henway’s becoming dictatorially
run, either by administrators or,
particularly, students. Therefore
every Monday night at 7:30
there will be a town forum to
discuss and field the impressions
and opinions of the students at
large.

Of course the most important
aspect of Henway’s governing
body is the Board of Directors.
These people have been ex-
tremely co-operative in their
dealings with the managers. The
directors include: Norbert Zahm
(Associate Director of Faculty
Student Association), Gary
Jones (Head of Student Activi-
ties), Charles Fischer (Head of
Residence), Tom Daley (Dorm
Director of Indian Quad), Dave
Jenkins (Quad Co-ordinator), a
Quad Board member, and tho
three operating managers.

Henway's relationship with
Indian Quud and university Is
one of co-opcration and peaceful
coexistence. It is in competition
with the Campus Center, but
this is tilkl'n for granted by ioth,
Being situated on thiI quad rind
in, thcorticnlly, llSiiIJIl‘ and used
space, the area occupied by
chwny‘s, when not in use by
same, is available to (llllttl, dorm,
and other organization‘s activi-
ties, Because of ii l'cw incidents
last yciir--thu management has
written u statement of policy
concerning the use of "drugs."
Let it be sufficient--

“The management of Han
uiuy'ss recognizes its rcsponsi»
bility as regards all Federal and
State laws, as well as University
policy, concerning the use of
“drugs” on the premises, We
discourage the USL‘ of any such
“drug” (marijuana, hiishish, and
“hard drugs") on premises.
Anyone attempting to use or
consume any “drug” in ch~
wuy's will be asked to leave."

The most thrilling interview
was between an ASP reporter
and chway. As quoted from
Ilcnway, “RUFF, RUFF, ARF,
RUFF," which roughly trans-
lated means--“Ya'll come down
to Henway's, hear? "

Dorian

by Andy I’nllcy

When Thi‘ Dorian Woodwind
Quintet came to the SUNYA
campus last year, it was a rainy,
horrible night, and everyone dc-
cided that it would bi- really
great to stay home. I didn't. And
I was happy...“ was one of the
highlights of last year's schedule.
Last night the Dorian played to
half ii house-"a crying shame,
since the main theater is not that
large. And the concert was bi-l-
tcr than last year's. It contained
less novelty in terms of “mo-
dcrn" music, and mori- novelty
in terms of now iirriingiamr-nts of
old pieces.

When one speaks of ii hand,
any type of hand, one talks in
terms of togetherness. The Do-
riiin Quintet is together, impec-
cably so. They work as one, and
this is only possible because they
are all so good at their particular
instruments that they ni‘i-dn't
worry about missed Cur-s and
wrong notes. Only the best in
the business can get away with
this. And the Dorian is certainly
one of the best.

The most obviously popular
piece on the program was ii
Mordechiii Itettmiinn trnnsci‘ipr
Lion of the Vivaldihar‘h doubli-
violin concerto, 'I‘hc transcrip

taking notes?) and Leo came
on, From the ﬁrst instant, he
held the overﬂowing Chapel
spellbound. I‘m glad I‘m not ii
guitarist; I'd feel intimidated
after hearing Leo. Fingers ﬂying

acoustic twelve-strings in a cori-

Unfortunately, not every piocv
on every program can be popu-
lar, and tho Milhaud Trio and
The Rivr-rri Cappricio were too
utonal for most of the audience
to sit comfortably with, though
the Milhaud was hardly atonal at
all, with some delightful ﬁgurvs
for [hp bassoon thrown in for a
chuckle or two.

to control his warm, husky voice
in a way that makes it as much
an instrument of expressiveness
