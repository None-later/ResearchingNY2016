PICKS FOR THE WEEKEND

Football—Albany vs RIT

The Albany football team returns home tomorrow
afternoon against BIT, one of three varsity teams to
face the Danes this season. The recent success of
Albany can be attributed to a tough defense. In
fact, Albany has a shutout string of 11 quarters
datin back to last year.

BIT. is basically a running team. They depend on
John Humphrey who had a long gam last year
against .Alhany 8: Jack Ronnno who ran for 82 yards
last week against Hobart. They have a top notch
pass receiver in Mike D’Avarzo who caught two
TD passes last week. ‘

Against Stony Brook, Albany fumbled 8 times,
losing 5 of those. If they play this sloppy against
RIT, they will be eaten alive. Bertuzzr must es-
tablish a passing attack to open up the holes for the
running backs. This game should be a real good
contest.

Prediction: Albany 21-RIT 20.

Soccer - Albany vs Queens College

The Booters return home tomorrow after losing
two games on a combination of bad breaks, and bad
calls. Hopefully their luck will change against
Queens College.

Prediction: Albany 4-Qucens 2.

Cross-Country: Albany vs Army

The Harriers face their toughest opponent ever
when they travel to West Point to face Army. Army
has a powerful team. Three of Army's runners have
bettered Albany's cross-country

record by 30

seconds. '
Prediction: Army will win easily over the Danes.

Baseball - Fall Baseball Tourney

Today at 12:30, the Albany State Baseball team
faces SUNYAC champ Oneonta in the opener of
Albany's Fall Baseball Tournament. Oneonta has a
tough team and figures to battle eastern power LIU
for the tourney championship.

Prediction: Oneonta 7, Albany 4, LIU should win
the tourney.

Pro Football - Jets vs Houston

The Jets offense looked great last week with Joe
Namath throwing for 6 TDs. However the defense
was not too impressive. The Jet secondary has to
tighten up.

Look for New York to return to a running attack
which proved very successful in the opener. The Jets
have an easy opponent in the Oilers. The game is
not being televised on Sunday.

Prediction: Jets (SI-Houston 17.

Pro Football - (Monday Night) Giants Vs Eagles

Two of the worst teams of football square off
Monday night. New York didn't look bad against
Super Bowl Champ Dallas last week and should win
their first game of the year. Norm Snead is the
probable at Quarterback.

Prediction: Giants 27-Eagles 21.

Danes Come Home; Meet Tough Foe 

by Bill Heller
Returning from Stonybrook
with a 14-0 victory, the unde-

feated (1-0), unscored upon,
1972 Great Dane Football team
will put their talents on display
for their Albany fans tomorrow.
They will face a veteran Ro-
chester Institute of Technology
squad, who pose a threat on
both offense and defense. Don’t
be misled by the fact that RIT
got bombed by Hobart, 63-13
last week, for Hobart is possibly
the number one college team in
New York State (they shutout
RPI 47-0 the week before). Al-
though Albany showed fairly
well last week, they will have to
play better Saturday, or possibly
get run over.

Against Stonybrook, the Danes
used an explosive running game
(271 yank) and an unyielding de-
fense to do the job. The Wish-
bone trio of Marvin Perry (HB),
Lonnie Davis (PB), and Carvin
Payne (HB) rolled up 82, 70,
and 55 yards respectively. They

passes, all incomplete.

The only real question on of-
fense was sloppiness. The Danes
fumbled five times, yet Coach
Ford isn’t too worried. “It was
mostly eureka-nus, as most of

90mm."

  

the fumbles occurred after the
backs had the ball, and not
during the handoff."

Meanwhile, the defense limited
Stony Brook to 145 total yards,
only 45 rushing. Big days Wen;
enjoyed by tackle Dom Pagano
(in on 11 tackles), safety Jeff
O’Donnell (2 interceptions), and
cornerback Tim Myers. Myers
helped on 12 tackles and had a
crucial aerial-theft on the Al-
bany goal line. All in all, the
defense really jelled and should
be able to do it again Saturday.

However, it won't be that easy.
RIT uses an unbalanced line,
that could confuse the Dane
defense, and possess their own
quality runners. To begin with,
there’s tailback John Humphrey,
who went 67 yards from scrim-
mage to score on the first play
against Albany last year. Along
with Humphrey, who likes to
run wide, is fullback Paul Ro-
mano, an inside threat. Finally
there's Joe Woode at slotback.

Woode is a dangerous runner
who likes to catch the football.
Both offensive and defensive
lines are studded with returning
lettermen and are capable of
doing eVerything they'll have to,
to make the day miserable for
Coach Ford.

What will Ford try to do to-
morrow? “Defensiver we’ve got
to stop Humphrey on the sweep
and Romano on inside dives.
Of fensively, we want to establish
our inside running game with
Lonnie Davis and see what they
try to do to compensate. Basical-
ly we want to probe for weak-
nesses. As far as passing goes,
we'll throw more than last week
to pen them up a little."

There you have it. In 1970, the
Great Danes upset KIT 30-21,
while last year Albany was
crushed at Rochester 4121. To-
morrow, look for a punishing
battle, but expect the Danes to
utilize the run and to come out
on top, something like 23~M.

Booiers Drop Second

by Nathan Salant

The Albany State booters lost
3-2 last Wednesday despite out-
playing Hamilton for most of
the game. The Danes came out
fighting, and jumped out in
front early, when George Kuh-
shian blasted a 22 yarder into
the lower left corner of the goal.
The load looked like it would
hold up for at least the first half,
when suddenly Albany's offensi-
seemed to fade. The result was
similar to last week's loss to
(ii-nl-soo; defense, no offense,
and two Hamilton goals. The
first goal was scored on a perfect
cross and tip in. the second on a

penalty shot thanks to the refe-
ree who called a hand hall on a
35 yurder which appeared to
have bounced off a fullback's
chest. The ref claimed the ball
hil his shoulder, and thus a hand
ball. The call was a poor one
because the rule states that on a
shot, a hand ball is only called
when a player deliberately and
ﬂagrantly places his hand or arm

booted over the crossbar, Alva"
rez picked the far corner and
tied the score at 2-2. Was the
score to remain tied? Not if the
refs could help it. First, Alvarez
was tripped up in the penalty
zone, but no call was made -- for
one reason or another « and play
continued. Then, at 30:00, Ha-
milton scored, lhanks to some
faulty footwork on the part of
the Danes’ defense.

Finally, a combination of our
own stupidity, and the referee‘s
ability to see through a wall of
defensive players, put the game
out of reach just when the tying
goal appeared to have been
scored. With 7 minutes left,
Ki-Icshian headed a corncrkick
into lhl? goal, only to have it
nullified by one of the officials,
who claimed the ball had
touched George's shoulder as he
headed it. I guess that it’s just
another case of the “ref with the
x ray eyes." The Dunes went to
the arguing game, and lost more
than the goal when Alvarez put
his hand on the rcf'a side to try
to get him to turn around and
listen to the argument. Alvarez
was automatically thrown out of
the game and the Danes wort-
forced to play shortlmnded for
the rest of the garlic.
