SUNY Albany’s student popu-
lation continues to grow an-
nually while the size of our
podium and available clam,
office and recreation space re-
mairis the same.

 academic podium was
designed to accomodate 10,000
F.T.E. (full time equivalent)
students and at present it
handles almost 12,000 such
students. Mr. John Hartigan,
Assistant Vice-President and
Controller, explained that most
of the crowding stems from the
fact that SUNYA was originally
designed and built to provide
only four years undergraduate
education. In, the 60‘s when
emphasis on graduate level pro-
grams increased, Mr. Hartigan
siad that the SUNY Master Plan
was changed to provide in-
creased space for use as graduate
school facilities to meet the
proportional rising demands for
this level education.

Besides an increased number of
students, this change also meant
that more space on campus had
to be devoted to research. With

more graduate courses, there
were fewer large classes so less
academic use has been made of
the lecture centers than if
Albany had remained an under-
graduate school. However, the
lecture centers are beneficial in
serving the SUNYA community
for other than instructional
purposes, such as providing
ample space for numermis
movies and speakers on campus.

Mr. John W. Hartley, Vice
President for Management and
Planning, said that our “sell-
ective crowding” on the podium
has been primarily in the
Humanities and Social Sciences
departments, the campus center,
bookstore and library. Some of
the crowding has been alleiviated
by the opening of Mohawk
Tower on Indian Quad for office
space. The departments of
Economics, Sociology and
Foundations of Education have
moved to Mohawk, and Mr.
Hartley said that during the
winter break, the Department of
Criminal Justice, which is
presently located. in the base-
ment of the library, will also

Council

by Steve Meyer
In a bizarre beginning to a
night filled with important bills
and tension-packed votes, Cen-

tral Council came to order last

Thursday night and then im»
mediately adjourned amid much
confusion. Chairman Ken
Stokem then called a special
meeting to order and Council
began to consider the business of
the evening.

After reports by the standing
and ad hoc committees, Presi»
dent Mike Lampert’s vetoes of
two bills passed by Council a
week ago were brought up. The
first veto was on the Media
Groups Use of Income Bill. Lam-
pert's primary argument was
that an income line (which is
substituted for use of additional
income over that line in the
group's budget) allows for better
ﬁscal control, tighter book-
keeping, and a better control
over how a group decides to
spend their monies. In addition,
Lampert pointed out that last
year's Council eliminated use of
income and that their judgement
should be heeded. Eric Lon-
schein, Councilman and WSUA
station manager, moved to over-

Condemns

ride the vet, Al Senia, ASP
editor-in—chief appealed to Coun»
oil to overturn the veto so the
ASP could add more pages with
the additional income they
hoped to raise. Glenn Von Noa-
titz, councilman and ASP news
editor, explained that the ASP
was budgeted for an average of
16 pages an issue, and 1624
pages have been issue sizes so far
this year. Later issues would
have to be small, and contain
many ads, if use of income was
not granted. After further dis-
cussion, the veto was upheld.

President Lumpert had also
vetoed a bill to increase the
membership of the Athletic Ad-
visory Board to assure freshman
representation. While asserting
he was morally in favor of the
bill, he had hoped that A.A.
Board could be asked what they
thought as well, citing the lack
of communication in recent
years between Council and AA.
Board. He and Chairman Stokcm
agreed on a one week delay so
that A.A. Board could inch and
report their decision back to
Council.

A proposal sponsored by Vice
Chairman Put Curran and Bob
Kattan had Council supporting
Indian Quad‘s attempts to alle-
viate the hazardous conditions
of their Parking Lot No.8 and to
have a safer lot constructed.
Quad President Lcnny Fromer
said that the parking lot is down

move to Mohawk. This will give
the library much needed addi-
tional space.

Also, moving from be down-
town campus to Mohawk will be
the Graduate School of Public
Affairs and the Social Welfare
Department. Mr. Hartley ex-'
plained, “This will open up more
space downtown for the expan:
sion of the James Allen Col-

     
  

Crunch * Seen as nrollment

legiate Center and the College of
General Studies” (the adult
continuing studies program).

Mr. Hartley and Mr. Hartigan
are both working on proposals
for the Capital Budget report for
next year. They hope to obtain
the needed increase in money
for the enlargement of academic
space. However, they said they

would not know the results until/
. , , (1

ﬂ

Grows

next year’s budget had been
approved and passed by the
legislature.

Regardless, the SUNY systems
enrollment continues to groW,
The Master Plan predicts an in.
crease of 7500 F.T.E. students
annually throughout the SUNY
four-year campuses and in luau
there will be 206,000 more
students than there are today.

V

Miscn

Our academic podium was designed to accommodate 10,000 full-timeequivaleni students. and in
present it handles almost l2,000 such students.

Evictions,

by the lake, surrounded by trees
so no one can look in, poorly
lighted, and out of hearing range
of the Quad. This could subject
students to assault, harrassment,
and robbery, said Promer. Cen-
tral Council unanimously passed
the bill and cast a white ballot of
solidarity.

In urging Council to support
George McGovern for Presidi-nt,
Barry Davis said Nixon‘s reelec-
tion would be "a tragedy for
SUNYA students." Ed Loputin
did not think Council should
“lend its help" to either candi‘
date. Mitch Frost, Grassroots
editor, supported Lopatin's
stand. Mr. Vernon Buck, direc-
tor of EOP, proposed the bill to
be sent to the Political and
Social Positions Committee and
have ll student referendum
looked into. This was done after
further debate.

Finance Committee then intro-
duced two bills for group alloca-
tion purpoaes from the Emcr
gency Spending Line. A proposal
to grant SUNYA Gay Alliance
$975 for educational purposes,
gay dances, and movies was
made. Chairman Stokcm
questioned Paul Travis, Gay Al-
liance President, as to whcthcr
he thought the group Could earn
their $200 income line through
only a few diincvs. 'l‘ravis said
the gay community would come
through. After cutting $25,
Council approved the buduci

Finance Committee then recom-
mended $526 for AMIA's hiring
a fourth student assistant to
supervise intramural games. The
large increase in student partici—
pation in such sports as football
and basketball necessitated the
call for additional manpower
and funds. After Chairman
Stokcm questioned the $2.25 an
hour wage paid, and President
Lampert stressed the supervisory
aspect of the job, the budget‘
was passed.

A group led by Barry Davis-
and Barry Sloan proposed that
council endorse the 7 Point
Peace Plan of the Provisionary
Revolutionary Government of
South Vietnam, Ed Lopatin
tried to refer this to PSP Com-
mittee, but his attempt failed,
Chairman Stokem informed
Council that a similar measure
was approved by a Central Coun-
cil of two years ago, Dun
Williams felt Council's endorse-
mom would be inintcrprctod an a
statemcnl of general student
opinion. i'hc bill was then ap-
proved.

Scth Ugclow introduced an
amendment to the Organization
of the Exocutivc Branch of Stu-
dent Association. It would allow
Council to review Ll‘ll.‘ President's
iippointirients to the jobs of
Controller, Business Operations

ator posts, Eric lionschcin pro-
posed that the bill be made

Pine Bush Continued

continued from page 1

Even more important is the natural water
supply provided by this area. Billions of
gallons of high quality water lie trapped in
the sand, beneath the layers of clay and
natural blocks. This reservoir could be the
answer to the communities' projected water
shortage in the future. Should, however, the
surface be bulldozed and ruined, harmful
substances could pollute the water supply.
Asphalt paving of roads through the area
would not allow rain water to soak back into
the ground, thereby creating a potential
run-off problem and slowing the recharge
rate. In addition, the Pine Bush serves as a
natural laboratory for environmental, biolog-
ical, botannical geological, and historical
study. It has been used frequently by local

school groups, not to mention by specialists
in several fields for extensive research.

Various groups Such as P.Y.E., the Albany
Taxpayer's Association, and Nature Conser-
vancy have long been interested in this area
and have now come together to form a
coalition: People for the Pine Bush. R,P.I.
has organized an entire class of architecture
students whose purpose it is to study the
area and come up with proposals for either
its preservation, or its development. Various
interest groups have made proposals ranging
from complete development to a 600 acre
park to a complete preservation of the
natural areas which sill exist.

It is the hope of the People for the Pine
Bush that this small but precious part of our
environment will not meet a fate similar to
that of Fort Orange, which is now preserved
for future generations under layers of con-
