' A Chat with the Veep

Spiro T. Agnew. Vice
President of the United
States, was recently inter-
viewed by Marc Rosenberg
and Anne Casey of the
Washington Campus News
Service. The following are
excerpts from the text of
that interview.

Mr. Vice Prestdcnt. what role
do you expect to play in this
election year?

I think there will be 3 dual
role, First of all, i have certain
ongoing responSihilities as Vice
President My function: a; \‘le'

those assignments are UnE'itnLZ

What, in your opinion. is tbr
main objective for the nears
media, what is the purpost’

I think the purpose of the
news media is to inform the
American public, not. to advcr
caie social change. And that is
one of the principal quarrels I
had, that they were advoates.
that they were very aggressive in
attempting to persuade the pub
lie to adapt their point of View l
don't think that's the function
of the news media. The media
should reflect the facts on both

of ii very weak cumpiiiuii buried

We feel that the President's
programs are extremer im»
portant to young people. We
think he has done a lot. He
supported the 18-year-old vote
from the beginning. I supported
it from the beginning. We don't
regard youth as a monolithic
structure. We like to appeal to
young people on an individual
basis, to respond to questions
about programs that they are
interested in.

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1973’.

 

because, as we know, primary
and secondary education is pri-
marily ﬁnanced by the pro-
perty. taxes and local taxes
from the school district and
local government.

So I would say we made a very
diligent effort to make sure that
funds are there for higher educa-
tion to expand properly. The
difficulty has been that there has
been a much greater expectation
of higher education for every-
one.

The open admissions programs,
which have failed so miserably at
the City University of New
York, are an example, in my
judgment, of a complete waste
of the educational dollar. They
cause people who are not quali-
fied to pursue a college educa-
tion into pursuits they are just
unable to complete.

In trying to prove that they
can be suitable candidates for ii
(ll-unu- at a four-year college, we
are wasting irretrievahlv dollars
that should he used training
these people for a useful career
in Mimi-thing they can do. Look
at llll' drop-out rate, and look at
lllt- comments of many other
i-tllii‘zilors on Ibis. lt's nul
enough Just to provide dollars
for education.

nnt qualified to lliiili-I‘lalli' llll'

normal assignments that: they
would get as college freshmen. I
think that cuts down on the
effectiveness and the improve-
ment of the traditional courses
that are being offered.

There is always this encourage-
ment of the unqualiﬁed person
to attempt to get a conventional
degree. Even if he is not quali-
ﬁed, even if he doesn't have the
high school credentials they
attempt to say, “well, he didn’t
get agnod high school education
and therefore he should have
remedial training as he starts his
college years." Now that may be
true in a few cases, but the place
to do that remedial education is
in a junior college, not in a
four-year institution which has
enough trouble providing the re-
sources to complete its general
curriculum.

And as far as the breakdowns
in the high schools themselves in
providing the youth with the
opportunity to cope with the
college curriculum, if the high
schools are deficient, let's spend
our mom-y on making sure our
high schools correct their defl-
cicncii-s. Let's not try to remedy
the situation by messing up our
four-year curriculum.

Charles Gregory "Bebe" Re-
bozo is a special friend of Presi-
dent Nixon. He should be. One
way and another, he has made
Nixon very, very wealthy.

One example of how Bebe has
enriched the President occurred
in February l967, when Nixon
came down to Key Biscayne for a
vacation. It was one of the rare
occasions when Bebe asked Nix-
on a favor. He asked Nixon to
pose for a photograph with one of
Bebc's friends, Donald Berg,
head of the Cape Florida Devel-
opment Co., whose friends in
clude friends of Meyer Lansky,
the hoodlum in exile in Israel.
lll return for posing for that pic-
ture with Berg, Nixon was given
two pieces at Florida real estate
at a large discount, He bought the
marked-down properly at very
little cost. The two lots are said to
be worth $150,000 liiilay Berg
used the photograph l()l' pul)ll('lly
that helped llllll sell other real

huge profits.

chauffeur. He worked for Pan
American as an airline steward.
He and a brother ran a gas sta-

tion.

During World War ll, he was a
civilian pilot for the Air Trans-
port Command. After‘ the war, he
really got going with a self-
scrvice laundry that grew into a
chain of laundries. He became a
stockholder in two finance com—
panies. Then he hit the jackpot in
Florida real estate.

In 1950, when Smalhcrs told
Nixon to take a vacation in
Florida, Smalhers asked Bebe to
“show Nixon a good time." The
two men met. liked each other,
and have remained fast friends
for 22 years.

When President Nixon came to
Miami Beach to accept the Ite-
pulilican Convention's nomina-
lit)”. he stayed in his five-house
compound on Key Biscayne.
Bebe packaged llial property and
those houses for him a $500,000
package

There are five houses ringed by

ALL FOR. DICK

Many people say Bebc's a good
guy. True, his business opera-
tions have been under investiga-
tion a couple of times. So what if
Representative Wright Patman
said there was something fishy
about that $80,000 loan Bebe got
from the Small Business Admin-
istration over objections of many
members of the SBA staff?

So what if the Small Business
Administration guaranteed the
rents in the Centro Commercial
Cubano, a trading mart in which
Bebe and friends had invested
$900,000 — a guarantee that made
the government (that’s us, the
taxpayers) take all the risks
instead of Bebe and his friends?

So what if the Miami regional
director of the Small Business
Administration, Thomas Butler,
was an investor in Bebe‘s Fisher
Island and a stockholder in a
bank Bebe heads up',’

Let's not detract from Bebe
licbozo's real purpose. Forget all
that business. Bcbe‘s life is
devoted to Nixon.
