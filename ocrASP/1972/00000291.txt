Miss Army Recruiting Gives her Best to the Boys;

Jane Fonda is scheduled to
speak here this Monday. A
capacity crowd Will probably
greet her at the gym and l‘m
quite curious as to the kirtd of
reaction her appearance will
draw. She is a folk hero of sorts
and l suspect ilrat site will be hailed
Monday, by the students arid the
on-campus press, as a national
savrour. All this despite the fact

that she hasn’t yet grown out of

her “ naive schoolger stage since
she entered the public arena in
1962. At that tiriie. you rriight
remember, she was Miss Army
Recruiting. Today she recruits

ls it a Bird? A Plane?
It’s a White Elephant

The Defense Department’s tragic waste of national
resources continues unchecked. The SALT agreements
signed last Spring by the Soviet Union and the United
States may have limited offensive and dcfcnsivc .ttttt
ballistic missiles, but the loopholes were many .rrrd
obvious, and the American military establishment has lit't‘tl
exerting great pressure on Congress to apprth- m-rr
weapons systems not outlawed by the arms limitation
pact.

The most expensive project now being proposed is thi-
rarely discussed B-l bomber. Last year the Air Force \\'.is
allotted $350 million for research and development of tin.
new manned bomber, which is intended as a rcplttct'tiit'tit
for the 15-52’5 presently used by the Strategit Air
Command. This rather small sum (by Pentagon standards
represents only the “tip of the iccburg” as far as lllltllt‘
furtding is concerned. Plans call for purchase of 250 oi
these new planes at a cost of $60 to $70 million klPll'tt'.
And if one takes into account the new ground suppori
Facilities, spare parts, and the new tanker fleet that Would
be required, the cost per plane amounts to some 3‘10 to
$100 million. This figure does not include the incvilalilr'
cost overruns. The entire B—l program may end up costing
us anywhere from $30 to $60 billion, depending on who is
doing the estimating.

Unlike opposition to the ABM in 1969 or the SST last
year, citizen groups have not rallied on Capitol Hill against
the 3—], probably because the bomber project has not yri
achieved a cost overrun large enough to create a ptiblir
scandal.

A more important reason why the discussion has been so
low-key is the condition of thcjob market in the aerospat «-
industry. The B-l’s prime contractor, North Ameritan
Rockwell has had to lay off thousands ofworkcrs in rctt'itt
months due to aerospace cutbacks, and hopes to hire bar it
about 15,000 of the laid off employees to Work on lltl‘
Ed.

All in all, the 15-] looks like an even bigger “wlitli
elephant" than either the SST or ABM. (Zriiics li.i\r
claimed that the 15-] offers only marginal advantages out
the existing fleet of 1562’s, and have pointed oiri [bar it
may very well be obsolete by the timc ii bctoirn
operational in 1980. Indeed, the whole court-pt ol ihn
inaiincd bomber may be obsolete, as we have Ltilllt' moo
and tttorc to rely on our long-range land based llllSSllt'H and
Poseidon submarines to provide otir deterrent,

It seems. then, that the main reason for building the l’: l
comes down to jobs for the aerospace industry. Without
the 15-1, the already hard hit aerospace firms will li.t\<' In
lay off even more engineers, technicians, and prodiniroir
workers. Final approval of the 15-1 would act as a “shot lit
the arm" for the defense finm,

Unfortunately for the taxpapcr, such a lease on lllt
would be only temporary. After the first new bombers roll
off the assembly litres, North Arirericaii Rockwell .iiitl lllt
other aerospace firms will be seeking new, ((tSllll'b
weapons contracts, and the military planners wrll propo'n'
new weapons systcirrs to provrdc work for the idle deli-nu
contractors. What this means is that new weapons SYSlt‘llt‘r
must continually be built not because they are needed to
ensure national security or protect American interests but
to keep the aerospace firms healthy.

President Nixon often speaks of converting a “war
cw'lUmY mm A Peace economy." As long as his atlmrnr
stration continues to back such new projects as the h l
bortibcr, such an“aei'r.ispace economy” will remain only a
dream.

Hood Elucidates ASP
Venereal Disease Articles

To lltc Edilor:

May 1 commend you for your
r-xcellent and educational arti-
cles on VD in A.S.P., September
22, 1972. Since the paper is read
all over the state, I would like to
correct the opening sentence and
another allusion to the same
figure later in your article. We
treated 400 cases of VD in
1970-7]. We did not report and
diagnose 400 cases, There is al-
ways a discrepancy between
Irr‘ulcd cases and positively drag
nosed (hence reported) cases.
Last year ('71-'72) we (reeled
fewer cases than '70-'71, but
because improved culture medi-
um was available (Transgrow) we
had more proven (reported)
cases than in '70-'71.

Also, to avert a general panic i
would use the word “can” in-
stead of “do” where you list all
the possible complications of
gonorrhea. To quote a doctor at
County Health, however, it is
accurate to say that, “Five min-
utes with the wrong guy can
blow motherhood."

It is also true that babies can
be blinded at delivvry with gun»
orrhea, ‘ it this is why all in-
fants’ eyes are prophylactically
treated immediately after birth
with appropriate medication. 1
have noted to my horror that
some of the books published
recently for the commune-
dwellors about how to live off
the land and how to do your
own delivery of u biiby, etc, utc.,
t'ail even to alludo to this neces-
sary measure to prt-vr-nl liliiid~

lll‘SS.

Thank you, too, for pointing
out that diagnosis and treatment
of V.D. are performed free
through the Student Health Ser-
vice this year, Massive doses of
penicillin are required preceded
by screening for syphillis, anti
the most dangerous thing a per-
son can do is take small amounts
of penicillin by mouth. This will
never cure gonorrhea and will
only mask syphillis, rendering
future testing for syphillis im-
possible to interpret.

Finally, I should like to em~
phasize the value, even thouin
limited, of the condom in the
prevention of syphillis and gon-
orrht-a. Since the advent of“thc
pill,“ the condom has lost in
popularity. As a contraceptive,
with foam, jelly or cream used
by the female, it is of some value
and as a prophylactic against
vr-noral disease also somewhat.
effective and worth using.

Abstinence, by the way,
should not be overlooked as the
safest and most effective way of
preventing not only conception
but VD as well.

Your articles should be viewed
as a positive contribution to the
community. What a proud day it
would be for SUNYA if we

An Open Letter
to John Hartley

Dear Mr. Hartley:

I welcome this opportunity to
express my thoughts on the new
parking regulations I have re-
searched the area quite exten-
sively for a course and a forth-
coming ASP article. Most of the
changes are acceptable. There
are a few that are quite objec-
tionable.

The change in the registration
policy represents several prob-
lems, The increase is too high. A
more realistic sum would be $2.
Presently, there are several situa-
tions that cannot be dealt with.
What happens to the student
who is here for only one semes-
ter? Must he pay the full $5?
Many faculty members own two
cars. Is it right to charge them
$5 to register each car?

i can find no legitimate reason
to discriminate against com-
muter students. They face the
same problems in reaching the
university as faculty and staff
personnel. in a memorandum
dated March 22, 1972 Rick
Iiiese best expressed thr- criti»
cism of this practice, “Why
should faculty and staff have a
preference over commuter stu-
dents in this area, unless it is to
keep one of the few remaining
vestiges of faculty status alive?
This concept, however, runs
totally against the idea of a
‘university community' and
treats students as nothing more
than ‘socond class eitizuns.‘

Some changes should be madc-
in the operation of the shuttle
bus. During peak hours it might
be advisable to run three bosses.
It should be a practice to run
one bus clockwise around the
campus and one countorclock-
wise for people going to particu-
lar points on the campus,

1 am certain the Univursity
Council will lnkc some of those
points into t'onsidorntion.

Yours truly.

and this year‘s tragedy is the
ultimate proof.

How can one talk about peace-
