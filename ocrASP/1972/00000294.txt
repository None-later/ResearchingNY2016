Harriers Tough In Defeat

by Kenneth Arduino

Albany put on a brilliant per-
formance against a tough Army
team before losing 24~32 in a
cross<country meet Saturday. Al
bany’s dual meet record is now
5-1.

Alhany was expected to be
destroyed by Army which is
now 4‘0. Army currently has
three men who have all bettereil
the Albany school record This
fact plus the home course ad
vantage made Army a big favor
ite, Even the normally optimistic
Coach Munsey was reluctant to
predict a win.

Alliany, though, showed their
poise and ability as they stayed
with the Army top runners most
of the way. With only a mile to
go Albany was only one point
behind and Vinnie Iteda was
closing In on the Army's number
3 runner, but then the strange

course became his undoing, The
Army runner knowing that a hill
was coming up act, Ierati-d down
a depression and gained enough
speed to get him tip the hill
ahead of Iteda. Vinnie was an
able to cut the [earl again.

Army took the first three
places with Albany finishing
fourth, Fifth and sixth, with
Iteda, Hill Sort-I and Jim
Schrader respectively. Nick
Dernarco, Scott Abercrombie
and Carlo Cherubino finished
eight, ninth and tenth,

The Albany ltuniier of the
Meet award was given to Jim
Schrader for his great perform
Iint'c. Jim missed most of prac»
tice this week because of leg and
knee injuries, but he was able to
sprint the last Ilt) yards to pass

ever." Bill was in twelth place
with a mile to go and then put
on a great sprint to finish fifth.
He started his charge on the
toughest part of the course
where Iteda's charge failed

Coach Munsey said that this
was his “most pleasant experi-
ence In eleven years of coach
irig." He felt that his learn per-
formed well and showed they
were not afraid iif Army

The Army (3 '1 also had
praise for the (lr it Danes, IIc
tolil Coach Munsey tlial he was
happy to run against Albany and
it was their toughest meet so far,
He was hoping Albany would
push his middlemen to their
potential but Albany did better
by beating them.

On a day when the weather-
man predicted 100% chance of
rain, the Albany booters hustled
onto the field looking for their
first victory of regular season
play. They gave it 150% effort
and the weather was no factor.
Sparked by two goals by Carlos
Alvarez, Albany went on to de—
feat Queens College handily last
Saturday 6-3.

Queens scored first to 'take-
the lead, but Carlos Alvarez,
after he had earlier missed a
penalty shot, scored soon after
to tie the grime at 1-1. John
Streeter scored on a free kick as
the ball ‘curved into the net, and
Leon Sedefian scored later in the
first half to give the Danes a 3-1
lead. Queens scored again and
looked like they were going to
explode had it not been for the
excellent Albany defense which
held them at bay, for the re-
mainder of the first half.

show'they have displayed thus
far. Leading 3-2, Uzi Haimoff
and Carlos Alvarez teamed up
for two quick goals which prac-
tically ended the game for
Queens. Queens could only score
once more before the filial gun,
but Cliff Wnlzcr, playing superbly
throughout the entire game,
finished off the scoring with one
more score for Albany.

John Thayer. returning from a
leg injury, played exceedingly
well in the goal throughout the
entire game for the Danes.

Wednesday, Coach Wingert
takes his team to Oneonta where
the hooters hope to even their
season won-loss record. Last
year Orieonta demolished
Albany 8-]. This is Coach
Wingert‘s home town, and there
is little doubt that he would
savor a victory here.

It was an ideal weekend not to
play baseball, and the games on
Saturday would probably have
been postponed, if it had not
been a tournament.

The "games" started on Fri-
day, with the first two contests
pairing LIU against Central
Connecticut and Albany versus
Oneonta. Central took advantage
of numerous LIU miscucs, and
advanced to the semi-final rouan
with a 7 to 2 win. However,
Albany’s luck did not go as far
as Central's. Albany bowed to
the Red Dragons of Onconta, ti
to 2, to take a seat in the losers
bracket. The Danes had battled
back against Oneonta in the top
of the fourth, knotting the
score, but found themselves
trailing by four runs via John
Szczeck‘s three-run double in
the bottom of the fourth. Kevin
Quinn had his three game win
streak stopped and saw his re-
cord drop to 3-], Iii the other
first round games, Scranton and
Springfield advanced to lltc
semi-finals with Scranton l)l':Il
irig City College of New York, I
to (l, and Springfield trimming
Ithaca, 7 to 4.

On Saturday morning, thr-
Iosers played out their t'titilcsls,
with Ithaca taking it on the t'lilii
again, 1'2 to It), losing to LIU,
antl Albany beating (IthY, '3 to
t), behind Ken LuRoe’s three
hitter. Jack Leahy and Nll'h
Ascienzodrove in State's runs,
while Dave Cohn set them up by

stealing two bases in a row.

In the final round, it was
Springﬁeld and Oneonta tied
after five full innings, l to 1.
With two gone in the top of the
sixth inning, Springfield scored
five runs against Oneonta
pitcher, Cary Davis, who got
into a wildness streak. He hit a
butter, walked three and
committed a costly error which
gave the opposition a .‘l to I
lead. But Springfield. with dark»
ness setting in, wanted more.
Instead of making an otit to get
