by' Bruce *

Defense was the name of the
game- last Saturday as Albany’s
Purple People Eaters led the
Danes to a 28-7 victory over
‘RIT.

The defense provided one
touchdown, gave the Danes great
field position that setup two
other scores, recovered four
fumbles and picked off four
passes. The shutout string of 14
quarters without being scored
upon was ﬁnally broken in the
warming minutes of the game.
The statistics were almost equal
but the tough Albany defense
made the difference.

The weather was not favorable

l

to the fans sage sparse crowd
dim up“ bit it didn't bother
the Danéi ground attack'chal-
king up 214 yardE'. R1 was
troubled by this weatherman-
pleting only 5 of 18 passes in a
strong, gusty wind and had to
depend on a ground attack.
Albany opened the scoring the
third time they had the ball. Tim
m' crunching tackle jarred
the ball loose from RiT's quar-
terback Wade Winter and Albany
recovered on the opponent's 31
yard line. Albany drove to the
goal line on 11 plays, all on the
ground, highlighted by a 14 yard
sweep by Marvin Perry to the 3
yard line. From there. McCoy

rosonberg

Allister went up the middle for 6
points.

RIT took possession of the ball
and started to march up the field
primarily on runs up the middle
by Jack Roman and end sweeps
by John Hu nprey. Winter com-
pleted the first pass of the day
but the drive was halted and the
Tigers punted to Albany's 22
yard line.

On the first play, Bertuzzi
made the key play of the game
when he faked a handoff and
went back to pass. The freshman
signal caller made his first com-
pletion ever at Albany a memo-
rable one as he found Bob
Baxter some 30 yards in the
clear and Baxter scampered 50
yards to the goal line/out-racing
a RIT defender.

State completed their scoring
for the half, thanks to the de-
ense. With RIT punting, Albany
swarmed in on the punter and
Vinnie Peirce got his hands on
the ball. The ball skidded back-
ward. In the scramble Arnie Will
picked the loose ball up and ran
ten yards to give Albany a 210
half time lead.

RIT, hoping to stop a psyched
Albany defense, received the
second half kickoff but gave the
ball right back to Albany two
plays later on a fumble. Albany
couldn't do much though and
Perkn was forced to kick. Once
again RIT turned the ball over
When Surely John Johnson
stepped in front of his men and
PiL‘ked off the ball bringing it
back to the Tiger’s 40. The

Unsung Grid Heroes:
Offensive Line

Danes

by Bill Heller

Almost overshadowed by u
great defensive showing, the
Danes who ran that Wishboncv'l‘
Sumtdﬂy deserve mention here»
not only Bertuzzi, Payne,
Allister, Perry. and Baxter, but
that wonderful forgotten entity
-the offensive linc. Yes, there is a
reason that Albany rolled up
three humlrcd yards against
aioumltl'l‘ defense, and it wasn't
only nifty running and well-
timed passing. It took some gut
blocking by the men that make
up the interior line.

Basically a young hunch who
have all been recruited, the of-
fensive line was unstoppable in
the first half, pavmg the way for
130 yards on the ground. Play

meeting place of ol'fcnsch and
dcl'cnsivv lincs is called, is an
unglumoruus, unnoticed jul).
While the backs and ends, and
own the defensive line share the
headlines, these men quirtly do
their work. Who arc they?

To begin with, thcrc's chon
Andrcadis, strong offensin-
tackle, who is co-cpptain of the
Great Danes. Isn't it rurc for an
interior lineman to be co-
capuiin'! As Coach Ford puts it,
“leaders coma in all dil'forcnt
sizes, shapes, and speed. Ilorc we
just try to let them emerge."
Anyone that watches Kleon will
be impressed with his great dc-
slrc and personal pride. At the
other tackle is Mike Bossier, who
has replaced the injured ’I‘y Cur-
run. Not big, Hauler is the typo
one "cnii't keep out of the line-

up,“ something Mr. Curran will
have to disprove when he returns
to action.

'I‘hcrc‘s been tremendous
competition for guard spots,
between three tough linemen.
Bill "Black Bart" Adams, llick
Duell and Joe Renaldo all saw
plenty of action against ltl'l‘.
Adams. in marricd vctcrun, is a
transfer from Hudson Valley
Community College, whcrc he
starred at tight i'nd last year.
Instead of fighting lid I’crka for
that position, Adams moved to
guard, where he earncd a starting
role and has performcd ad
mirubly. A convortcd fullback.
Rick Duell uses quit-kncss and
power to prch his point. .lot-
llcnnldo "lmsilgdlyn according to
Ford. Combining size, nli’t'llulll,
and agilily, hc has conn- on
lately to clinllcngc for full-limo
status.

Perhaps the most nnprcaslvn-
llnl'niull is 5'0", l70 pound
freshman ('cntI'r Andy Loo. Luv

'l‘hcsc than arc the men that
movu tln- Wishbone. Oh yes, I
almost forgot about the rest.
Marvin l’crry, made like a tackle,
throw grcnt blocks for his bud-
dies in the backfield. Splitimd
liob Baxter caught two pussies

for 86 yards, one a 77 yard to
bomb. Carvin Payne rolled up 7'7
yards in eight carries while
McCoy Allister, subbing for the
injured Lonnie Davis, really
came through Allistcrloggcd 76
yards in his first start, and may
have earned many more. Mean-
while, mild-mannered John
livrtuzxi ran the Wishbone like
Ito's been playing it for decades,

He was truly outstanding at the ‘

lu-lm in both play calling and
reading the defense. Enough

wobbly punt that bounced on

Payne quickly jumped on the

in the fmquarter, play was
sloppy by both teams. Albany
lost the ball on two fumbles

Arnie Will in a series of three

but RIT's fourth down pass was
dropped by Joe Moffett in the
end zone. With the seconds
ticking away, Wade tried a long
pass but Jeff O’Donnell picked it
off and Gordy Kupperstein ran
out the last 10 seconds to pre-
serve a 28-7 victory for Albany.

Outstanding for the Danes on
defense was Tim Myers who was
all over the field. The Danes
offensive line was quite impres-
sive,openingl up many holes for
the , backfield.

Albany now takes their 20
record to Niagara next Saturday
night.

The Radical Bible - A modern Invention or modern crutch?

Radical Bible Relevant?

THE RADICAL BIBLE IS
THE RELEVANT BIBLE to
more than 30,000 young Ameri-
cans who have purchased copies
during the past 3 months.

Pick any hot issue today~
peace, justice, equality, freedom,
love, the poor, etc.- and the
Bible has something to say about
it.

Now dig out those relevant
passages from both the Old and
New Testament, group them un-
der key, meaningful and current
classifications-then match them
up with the writings of today’s
statesmen, educators, politicians
and philosophers, authors, revo-
lutionaries and churchmen, and
you have a hard-hitting, fast-
paced little Bible that’s as rele-
vant today as the Bible ever was.

This unusual American bible
offers a unique and morally
forceful approach to today’s
monumental problems of war,
hunger, racism and economic ex-
ploitation.

As such, the book’s inter-
twined statements form a cogent
philosophical, ethical and moral
critique of the relationship be-
tween the 'rich and the poor of

THE RADICAL BIBLE un-
doubtedly will fill a vital need
among modcrn Americans" the
need for articulate and compel-
ling moral statements that ad-
dress thcmsr-lvr-s to today's prob—
lems in contemporary terms
—but with traditional theological
backing.

The English adaptation (it sold
more than l0(),()00 copics in
Europe under the titlc BIBEL
PROVOKA'I‘IV) is now in its
third printing which brings to
60,000 the total printed in
America.

This adaptation was under-
taken because thc publishers be-
lieved the scriptures had been
used by Christians, pcw and pul-
pit, too long only to comfort the
afﬂicted, and they felt they
should also afflict the comfor-
table. Thc scriptures remain con-
temporary, thcy feel. 'l‘hey ad-
dress themselves to thc problems
which face us, if Wt' care to
listen. The Bible doesn't give pat
solutions, but it can prick the
conscience to the point we are
driven to see solutions and to
become part of the solutions.

Every Thursday night the third
floor of the gym is ﬁlled with
the sound of music. Cheerful
music, solemn music, music that
wants to make you move. Every
Thursday night, starting 8:30,
the dance studio on the third
floor is filled with people. They
have come for Israeli dancing.

Israeli dancing was instituted
here in 1969 when Hillel ap-
proached David Surowitz, then a
freshman, asking him if would
like to teach the dances that he

      
  

knew. David said yes and has
been teaching ever since. Ac-
cording to him, Israeli dance has
become more successful every
year. Now under the sponsorship
of Hebrew Club, dancing draws
between 80 to 90 people every
week. Last year, because of the
success of Israeli dancing, Dr.
Edith Cobanc, Chairman of
(iirls‘ Physical Education, in-
iormcd quld that those stu-
dents thcn attending Israeli

dancing on Thursday nights
would be able to receive gym
credit. A fourth quarter gym
course was also offered. This
year again those students who
attend dancing on Thursday
nights will receive one credit per
semester, and there will prob-
ably be a day course taught next
semester. Roberta Kupietz will
teach the course as she did last
year.

'At the sessions on Thursday

assistant dance leaders, Roberia
and Debby Rosenman, teach and
demonstrate the dances. About
three new dances are taught at
each session and dances from
previous sessions are reviewed.
The dancers who come are both
beginners and more advanced.
According to Debby those who

nights David, along with’ﬁ
from, Union and RP], people
from groups such as Modern
Dance and Folk Dance, Jewish

white. Debby finch the group
very worthwhile because it ‘I the
type of club where people can't
be shy. Dancing leads to, to-
getherness and sociability be-
tween people. It is a good way
to meet people, especially for
freshmen. It is neither structured
or restricted--dancing is a very
free and easy type of club where
everyone can participate. Most
people ﬁnd it very relaxing and
informal. Debby says it is a good
way to “let off steam from the
tensions of the week." People
pick up dances Very easily and
quickly as many of the same
steps are found in the different
dances.

To let off steam, relax and
enjoy are indeed the reasons that
many people come to Israeli
dancing. However many other
people come because they wish
to be more culturally involved
with lsrael. According to David
Surowitz, ever since the 1967
Arab-Israeli War there has been a
growing desire on the part of
many people to identify more
closely with Israel, and doing
dancing is one part of relating to
Israeli culture. Dancing makes
many people more aware and
sensitive to the Israeli situation.

This year Israeli dancing has
been drawing a record number
of people. According to Roberta
Kupietz, the grOup hopes to put
on a major performance this
year, similar to the one put on
last year during Israeli night.
Other projects are under
consideration also.

The October Album Bag

Miracle Lick's debut album,
“Thirty Days Out," (Reprise MS
2085) provides yet another
proof that the Warner Bros. con-
glomerate will release anything
these days. Right now, Miracle
Lick is harer a mite better than
your typical good bar band.
They might turn into something
one of these days, but at the
moment their roots and in-
ﬂuences are hanging out a bit
too thiously. The LP opens
with an acoustic guitar riff sto'
len from the irateful Dcud's
"Uncle John's Band," displays a
vocalist who's imitating Roger
McCain a bit too blatantly, and
gets down with it on side two
with some stolen Allman
Brothers guitar runs (executed
rather stiftly, at that). Buck to
the bar circuit, boys, and prac-
rim)-o.o.i

fetcr Frampton‘s Camel
played at RPI earlier this month,
so it's as good a time as any to
mention Pete's recently released
solo LP, Winds 0/ Change (A&M
SP 4348). Rest assured, the al-
bum's a great deal better than
the concert was. Pete's one of
the best English hard-rock gui-
tarisls, and this album displays
his style quite well. The studio
format gives him a chance to
come through. The material
vuries~al| of ii. is at least toler-
able, and two or three songs-r
“Oh, For Another Day," “Fig
Tree Buy," and “The Lodger"~
stand on their own merits.

l’r's demonstrated on their last
album, "Fragile", that they had
ﬁnally learned to build their
separate talents into one co-
herent whole. Now they’ve re-
leased a follow-up, “Close to the
Edge" (Atlantic SD 7244) that
builds on and refines the style
developed on “Fragile.” “CIOSI:
to the Edge” is a "concept"
album; the title composition oc-
cupics all of side one, and a
mimsuitc, "And You and I"
shares side two with the longish
“Silll'l‘llll Klmtru."

I'm gent-rally prejudiced
against “court-pt" albums,
most of them tlon'l hich the
balls to stand up as rock and roll
and they don't have the intelli'
gcncc to be anything else. Jethro
'I‘ull's [‘hick as a Brick" was
merelyr the most recent of a
long string of such diameters. But
if any blind could bring one
off,ch cauld, and, happy sur-
prisc, they did! Credit for this
Hupnrb album goes to all fivq
members of the band, but priv
marily to dirccrsinger/lyricist
Jon Anderson, bassist Chris
Squire, and keyboard magician
ltick Wakeman. Squire supplies

the cojoncs; his bass ﬁgures are
completely unique, very Euro-
pean in a way that's hard to
define but easy to feel, and
totally compelling. He doesn't
play a rhythmic bass, and he
doesn't play counter-point to
the guitar (the way Phil Lesh
does), and he doesn't even play
the jumpy, driving lines Jack
Bruce perfected. His conception,
his phrasing, and his timing are
something else.

Rick Wakeman supplies the
musical intelligence to keep this
melangc together. Equally adept
on grand piano, harpsicord, or-
gans, mellotrons, and synthe-
sizers, he has to be the best
keyboard player in rock (Keith
Emerson paid to see him in
concert recently) and one of the
best keboard players in any style
of music today. Anderson sup-
plies both the vocals and the
lyrics in fine style; his high-
pitchcd, a-scxual voice becomes
the perfect instrument for the
twisting, surrealistic pictures his
lyrics paint. There's a printed
lyric sheet so that you can figure
it all out, but it’s more fun jugt'
to lay brick and let phrases-
"Crossed a line around the
chungc of summer’i..“Changed
only for a sight of sound the
spacc ugrccd"... flush through
your mind. With each listening,
different phrases seem to flush
out, so it all works out in the
and.

I have only one reservation in
recommending this album-this
Is dense, complex, layered
music, On my stereo, which is a
fairly fancy rig, the production
and separation are excellent. On
a cheap stereo, the album might
sound jumbled and chaotic. But
then. iweren'tt you really
looking for a good excuse to
upgrade your rig?
