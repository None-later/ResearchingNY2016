For Uptoniin'g ,C-Il a

by Arslynn Abare

If you’ve driven or walked
onto campus recently, you have
probably noticed large, pastel
signs with a purple and white
graphic of a U and a C. These are
not misplaced Utica Club adver‘
thements. They are announce-
ments of SUNYA’s upcoming
community-University Day
Open House.

The event is slated for Satur-
day, October 21, from 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. It was planned as an
effort to develop town-gown re-
lationships “giving all Captial
area residents a chance to see,
hear, and share the university
and its activites."

Now, the next logical question
is what activities are going to be
seen or hear, much less shared,
on a typical SUNYA Saturday.
Herein lies the rub.

First of all, October 21, is part
of Homecoming weekend. Pro
gramming for that day includes
an alumni tent, which will pro-
vide refreshments and music
from 11 am. on; the Homecom-
ing Parade at 1 p.m.; and the
Homecoming football game, this
year against Brockport, at 2 p.m.

In addition, a hast of exhibits,
tours, lectures. multi-media pre-
sentations, performances, coffee
hours, demonstrations, discus-

sions and displays have been
planned for the day.

’Hie lecture center alone has
scheduled over 20 presentations;
from a media trip through the
Adirondacks to a multi-media
introduction to philosophy;
from a university produced film
about Community Service to a
television tape of “Oh, What a
Lovely War.”

Administrators and faculty are
planning to be on hand in rela—
tively informal situations. The
history and English departments,
for instance, are planning coffee
hours, and Dr. Benezet will be in
his office, ready for visitors,
from 1 to 3.

Lectures will include a discus-
sion and demonstration of stage
lighting by the theatre depart-
ment; “Planning for your Aged
Parent," by the School of Nurs-
ing; and “Police and Local Com-
munity," by the School of
Criminal Justice.

Exhibits are planned by a host
of groups. To name a few, dis-
plays will be set up by the
departments of art, classics,
English, German, Italian, atmo-
spheric science (on the 22nd
floor of Mohawk Tower), bio-
logy, chemistry, geology, phy-
sics, anthropology, geography,
inter-American studies, psycho-
logy and sociology, the Office of

International Programs School
of Business, School of Social
Welfare, Inﬁrmary and Physical
plant are also planning exhibits.

'11“! Allen Collegiate Center
and College of General Studies
will man information booths,
and tours have been planned for
the nuclear accelerator, experi-
mental greenhouse, PAC, library,
computing center, a residence
area, steam plant, motor pool,
maintenance shops, physical
education building, and the
health center.

Student input in the effort will
center largely around the volun-
teers who will act as general bus
and walking tour guides and who
will man general information
booths. Guides and booth sitter
are still needed, and any one
interested should come to one of
two training sessions: Tuesday,
October 10, at 4 p.m. in LC 1,
or Wednesday, October 11, at
7:30 p.m. in LC 21. Those who
are interested, but who cannot
come either time, should contact
Ron Daniel, T7796, or Aralynn
Abare, 7-7716.

In addition, students will be
performing in music ensembles
and theatre productions, and
will be at work in art, language,
and science labs. Also, several
student association organizations
are expected to participate.

Off-campus housing director .loe Scaring also spoke to the group
and informed them that he had had a personal conversation w1ih lhc
mayor dealing with the entire problem.

He assured the students that no one would be thrown out into [I c
street.

Various forms of protest were also discussed, including llil'
possibility of calling for a general student rent strike. The Sludi'il'
decided to place a bulletin board in the Crisis 6300 office on Duim
Quad as a central communication point and a place to post i-vwim.
notices, if any are received.

During the meeting students also charged that the my L».

Women’s Liberation
Off to a Strong Start

by Mindy Altman

On Monday night, October 2,
meeting room 315 in the Cam-
pus Center was starting to fill.
By 7:30 there were 50 people
there, and the first meeting of
SUNYA Women's Liberation got
under way, led by President
Peggy Nadler. Peggy helped in
starting Women’s Liberation on
campus last year when in coming
here :is u Freshman, she saw thzil
Ihcrc wcrc no women’s organiza-
lions.

Women‘s Liberation has conic
u long way since last year, and
this ywr's group promises to bc
illl cxtrcmcly activu one. Many
issues and activities were taken
up and discussed zit the first
meeting, This year, Women's Lib
is sponsoring a number of speak
crs, who are being sent here by
Capitol District Women. The
speakers will be representing the
Niitioniil Organization of Wo-
mcn, abortion, radical feminists,
education, lesbianism, sexuality,
()ldcr Women's Liberation, wo-
men and politics, and women
iind work.

A number of committees and
groups were also set up at the
meeting. Pcoplc volunteered to
sit ill. thc Womcn's Lib table in
Lhi- Campus Ccntcr. 'l‘hc tohlc
will be in the lobby on Tuesdays
and Fridays from 11:00 to 3:00.
A .riommitlcc was also assigned to
take care of Women’s Lib publi-
city, which includes posting
signs and notices about mcctings

and lectures on the uptown and
downtown campuses, and off-
campus. Another group was
formed to take care of getting
the films that Women's Lib will
sponsor this year. It was also
decided to have discussions on
the films after they are shown. it
was also decided that SUNYA
Women's Lib will be getting in
contact with the women's lib
groups of other universities.
Women's Lib has also under
taken n number of activities and
projects in conjunction with the
SUNY Caucus on Women's
Rights-Studan group (COWRS).
One of these important issues is
getting a birth control program
into thc infirmury rind ii full
time gynecologist zilong with a
referral system for abortion and
a counseling scrvicc for birth
control. Other projects include
ridding the campus of sexism in
courses, forming a state wide
women's newsletter and getting
more women’s studies courses ul
SUNYA so that iln interdiscipli-
nary second field and major can
get under way. This term a
number of courses are being
offered already: History of Wo-
men in the Americas, The Rhe-
toric of the Women's Rights
Movement and Womcn in Mo-
(lcrn Literature. 'l‘hrcc new
courses will be offered in the
spring semester: Women in An-
liquily, Women in European His-
tory, and Contemporary French
Women Authors. Courses being
planned for Fall '73 include:

Women in Drama, Spanish Wo-
men Writers of the 20th Cen-
tury, and Ethnology of Women.

Another major issue discussed
at the meeting was that of con-
sciousness raising. Consciousness
raising groups, which are small
awareness type of groups in
which problems, feelings and ex-
periences can be discussed, are
forming on each quad.

Furthermore, anyone who is
interested in obtaining Ms. Magu-
zine or Speakout, ii locnl wo-
men’s newsletter may obtain
subscriptions through Womcn's
Lib. Speakout is always looking
for people to contribute materi-
al, Material is also nccded for the
Women‘s Forum column which
is found in the ASP every Fri-
day.

SUNYA Women's Lib has in»
deed gotten off with ll strong
start. According to Peggy, the
group will be active this year in
trying to reach many people and
many aspects of campus life. All
men are invited to join nlso. For

ing involved and working with
the various groups call Mary Ann

office in Albany to the indivi-
dual schools. Under thc new
system a single application will

this single form will be processed
at the central office and sent to
the schools listed by the stu-
dents. Also, prc-scrccning for

academic screening to apply to

As SUNYA evolved into a large
university center, the academic
admissions standards increased.
A student with a high school
average in the 79-80 range with
high SAT scores could reason-
ably expect to be admitted in
1964. In 1972 those with aver-
ages in the 85-87 range faced
questionable chances of gaining
admission. Complete data on
