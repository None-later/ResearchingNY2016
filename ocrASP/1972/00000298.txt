The Forum

Should Seniors Move In?

Dr. Charles G. Fisher
Director of Residences

Increasingly, colleges and uni-
versities are considering alternate
uses for campus residence halls.
This "creativity" has been neces-
situted by two factors—residence
halls recently opened or nearing
completion whose need was
based on u growth curve that has
subsequently leveled off, and
larger numbers of students elec-
ting to live off-campus. For
some administrations facing this
dilemma, the housing of senior
citizens on campus has been
identified as one viiible alterna-
tive. Interest in this possibility
hurl been generated by the fol
lowing factors.

Many students, at least since
the middle sixties, hnvc indi~
culled rcpezitcdly thut colleges
iind universitici; today do not
represent the “rciil world"*they
luck relevance, The same ncu~
dcmic iiluofncss which wuii con-
sidcrcd an udvuntiige for ritu<
(it:an u generation ago iii seen by
today's students: 6’] ll basis to
criticize the a? experience.
With at least omc justification,
those students are suying thut
their cumpusci; me too protected

from the world. In order for the
college experience to be mean-
ingful, they feel there is ll des-
.perate need for more real-life
experience. One way of bringing

    

Charles G. Fisher
thc,reul world onto the campus
might be to provide oppor~
lunilies for students to relate to
ii mbrc diverse campus popu-
Intion.

For (their part, many senior
citizons hLIVc been vocal in their
dissatisfaction with the standard
lure of retirement homes and
communities. Just as the college
community is seen by many of
its students, these institutions
for the aged are also judged ii
shallow reﬂection of reiil life
with little or no opportunity to
rclutc to u broudcr ugc spectrum.

These people see no need to
leave their own communities and
enter one where their days are
ﬁlled with meaningless activity
to keep busy. They feel as if
they can still make a signiﬁcant
contribution to their sociegy as
well as lend meaning to their
own lives through post-retire-
ment activity. Most possess
knowledge that can only come
from years of signiﬁcant experi-
ence-experience that can be of
value to others, particularly
young people.

Another factor to be con-
sidered is, actually, the catalyst
allowing the consideration of
other than student use of resi-
dence halls in the first. place.
Many residence programs are
having real difﬁculty in main-
Iainlng ii satisfactory level of
occupancy. Most administrators
would be loath to re-establish
the parietal nile requiring on-
cumpus residence which was en-
forced tit many institutions up
until a few years ago. And yet,
the enrollment growth of coil-
logos and universities bus slowed
appreciably und residence hulls
which were planned five and six
ycuru ago arc-just not needed
toduy. In uddltion, students in—
tcrcntcd in experiencing us much
of a “real life" living environ-

Editor's Note: In' this tutu: the ASP continue- it! 

series, “The Forum" In which a relevant qucatlon ll
asked of various university leadera. The question
today is: “What are‘ your views on a proposal to
house senior citizens in vacant dorm space on

campus?"

tructed to off-campua accommo-
dation: where Ii higher degree of
independence can be realized.

It is not surprising, then, that:
the possiblity of housing senior
citizens on campuses has been
raised. The Saint Mary's Housing
Project in Syracuse is, perhaps,
the ﬁrst project to encompass
this concept. Sevoral years ago,
Syracuse University and the City
of Syracuse found that. each
owned adjacent land insufficient
to meet their respective needs
for additional student and senior
citizen housing. They developed
a cooperative project combining
both types of housing in a single
architectural plan, with Ii signifi-
cant. number of shared facilities
and services. To date, their ex-
perience him been positive with
the degree of interaction be-
tween the two generations most
impressive. Beginning with the
current ucudcmic your, the State
University of New York, College
at Buffulo, is leasing one of its
residence balls to Erie County
for use us a senior citizen hous-
ing facility. The possibility of
joint programming although not
originally planned, is now being
considered with considerable in-
Icrcst from both the students
und the senior citizens.

The udvuntugcs of this kind of
cooperative housing are several.

Basically, retired people have
many things to offer which can
prove valuable to student: who”
are facing the reality of finishing 1
college and entering a particular
occupation or profeulon. An
example might: be the benefit ,
that a retired Chemical Engineer '
could be to a student in Chemi-
cal Engineering just beginning to
consider his professional career.
Additionally, many retired peo
ple have developed skills not
necessarily related to their pro-
fessional lives which could also
be of meaning to college stu-
dents. A life long interest and
subsequent ability in carpentry
could easily strike a responsive
chord in the life of a student.
with n simiinr, but as yet unde-
veloped interest In this same
area.

On the other hand, it is sug-
gesth that the lives of senior
citizens could be enriched mea-
surably from their experience
with students as persons of
worth with many skills and
knowledge to be shared. The
self-esteem of these people could
be raised considerably as a result
of their feeling that they are
needed by others and con-
sequently, that they are still
people of worth.

The possibility of such u pro—
gram being given serious consi-
deration at the Stute University
of New York iit Albany is un-
known iit this time. The need for
additional academic and admini-
iitriitivc space this year has been
great. enough for a residence
fucility to he used for thie pur-
pose. However, the housing of
senior citizens in S.U.N.Y.A. res-
idence hulls remains u viable
possibility and one that will war-
rant close attention should the‘
need arise to devise additlonnl
wuys to use residence halls.
