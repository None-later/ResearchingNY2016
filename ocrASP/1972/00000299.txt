 

Withdrawal

Propped-up lhieu Prevents Peace Accord

By W. AVERELL HARRIMAN

The writer was PresidentJohnson 's Ambassador to the Paris peace talks.

WASHINGTON — The American public
is entitled to know what the President's cur-
rent plan is to end the war in Vietnam. As the
election campaign heats up. Henry Kissinger
has held highly publicized secret talks in
Paris and in Saigon. An impression that real
progress toward peace is being made is being
created. Secretary Rogers personally predicts
peace before the end of the year. Yet nothing
has been disclosed of the substance of these
talks and therefore it is impossible to judge
whether realistic offers are heiiig made or
whether the ﬂurry of activity is just part of
the effort to re-elect the President.

The last public United States offer was the
withdrawal of all American troops within
four months after the start of an inter'
nationally supervised cease-fire and the
return of our prisoners. If the North Viet-
namese are being required to give up perina-
nently their military struggle while Thieu re-
maitis in power. there is no possibility of the
offer being accepted.

When l was the American negotiator in
Paris we recognized that cease-fire first was
not a promising route. The North Vietnamese
have beeti consistent in asseiling that
political arid military aspects of a settlement
are indivisible. To a guerrilla a cease-fire
without some settlement is a surrender.

Any political settlement must necessarily
involve the status of Thicu. Since the bomb-
ing halt of November 1968 opened ilie way to
serious negotiations. President 'l'liieu has
been a major obstacle to a compromise solu-
tion.

Although we had agreed in October I968 to
join the negotiations after the bombing
stopped. he first reneged on his commitment
and then created the unseemly dispute over
the shape of the table in order to break off or
at least to delay talks until the new Adminis~
traiion took office. Finally. just before the
inauguration in I969. the path was cleared
for substantive negotiations including the pri-
vate talks which were the only place progress
could be made.

During this period the North Vietnamese
had removed most of their forces from the
northern two provinces of South Vietnam and
practically ceased fighting there; Instead of
seizing the opportunity for immediate dlsv

cussion of mutual reductioti of hostilities
which Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford
had publicly called for as the first order of
business. the Nixon Administration took as
its first task restoring of close relations with
Mr. Thicu. These relations had become badly
frayed as the Johnson Administration applied
pressure to induce Mr. Thicu to participate iii
the peace talks.

Then. as now. President 'I'hieu saw his pri-
mary goal as maintaining his personal posi-
tion. This meant opposing a negotiated solu-
tion since any compromise would inevitably
eliminate his absolute power.

The Nixon Administration tolerated
'I‘liieu's scuttliiig of real negotiations by
refusing to Iiave his representatives partici-
pate in private meetings with the National
Liberation Front. When. two months later. he
condescendcd to accept private meetings. he
stated that under no circumstances would he
agree to a coalition government. He continues
to oppose adamantly any coalition govern-
metit although it is obvious that there can be
no political settlement without some sharing
of power.

liven now. when the comings and goings of
Dr. Kissinger have raised some hope of
moving toward peace. Mr. 'I‘liieu has again
dug in his heels. This month he called for
coiiiiiiiiiiig "relentless bombing" of North
Vietnam for "six or seven months more" io
produce the “total destruction of their eco-
nomic and war potential."

So far as we cart tell. the Nixon Adminis-
tration has continued to give Mr. Thicu veto
power over the United States iicgotiating
position. Despite the Administration's a-
vowed solicitude for the right of the South
Vietnamese people to self-determination it
helped to create and then excused the faults
of'l'liieu's re-election in a one«candidate race.
The overwhelming majority of the South
Vietnamese people clearly want peace. They
showed this by giving the most votes in last
August's Senatorial election to a Buddhist
slate which emphasized a compromise peace.
Instead the people have been made victims of
continuing war and are subject to repressive
military rule. including the jailing and
torturing of non-Communist opponents and
'he suppression of the press.

“Contrary to Hartley” Cars
Ticketed at Colonial, Indian

To the Editor:

The recent confusion con-
cerning parking regulationswas
exemplified by the events of this
past Tuesday. As a University
Senator. l was informed at. the
Oct. 2 meeting that parking
regulations Were still suspended.
l was further informed that they
would not. be enforced without
due notification of the entire
university community in the
media.

Contrary to this assurance
from Vice President Hartley.
cars were ticketed and towed
from the front. of Colonial
Quadrangle and ticketed in an
approved area on Indian Quad-
rangle. The question arises as to
why the two quads with the
parking facilities

worst Wl't‘t'

selected for the initiation run of
the tow truck. It. seems that
resident students are being harassed

by this selective enforcement.
Why wasn't towing begun closer
to the academic podium, where
a larger proportion of faculty
and staff cars would be parked?

Again it. seems that the credi-
bility of both the administration
and the University security has
been threatened. If rules were
enforced consistently. to both
students and faculty. there
would be no complaints. But
selective. unanounced adherence
to a previous set of regulations is
not. in my opinion. reasonable.

Open Letter to Hartley

 

$5.00 Parking Fee Unfair

Ib-ur Mr. Hartley

As a graduating senior as of
this December. I find fault with
the present regulations regarding
the fee for parking. As I under‘
stand it. the fee is $5.00 for the
full year ending next September.
Since I am graduating in three
months. I do not. feel that it is
right that I should pay the full
year's fee. I feel that an equi-
table possible alternative is that. I
and others who will not. be hert
next semester, should be charged
for only one half year, or $2.50.

Certainly there are extenuating
circumstances in any rule of law.
and the law should be not only
fair but ﬂexible. As I mentioned.
this is just a possible solution
perhaps other people have (lif
i'erent suggestions.

Before closing I would like l.t.
ask one question: what is the
rationale behind the $5.00 fee?
Last year. stickers were only
$.50 and now they jump up Lc
$5.00. Why the inﬂationary rise
in cost? Who determined that
$5.00 was the "asking" priee':
Why wasn't the cost set a $2.50.
$3.50 or $.50?

The campus has been un-
usually silent over this issue
Apparently acquiescence is tbc
theme. l feel a policy statement
should come forth with regart
to this issue.

Please respond as soon as pos
sible. I might add that I have not
paid my parking fee as yet.

Thank you for your time ant
consideration.

The Game
of Patriots
_ and Traitors

To the Editor:

In a letter in the ASP (Sept.
26). Mitchell Frost. claims to see
no contradiction between con-
demning terrorism while sup-
porting war. And yet. in the
body of his letter. he not. only
demonstrates the contradiction.
but. be fully endorses it.

First he says that the power to
punish terrorists "has been legi-
timized by tradition." He then
says that. the United States or
Israel may kill innocent people
in countries that. harbor ter-
rorists-for this is precisely what
“the waging of a defensive war"
does.

Mr. Frost. has no qualms about
killing people provided “tradi
Lion” spreads the responsibility
thin enough to prevent guilt. He
fails to see that his "morality" is
simply “might makes right." The
American colonists had no
“right” to overthrow an estu-
l)lished government by force.
But. they did it. so they are
patriots instead of traitors.
Later, the coiifirtleracy faich iii
a similar they were
“rebels” instead of patriots,

InUVl‘ 50

There is no power on earth
which can lirini: presidean
Johnson and Nixon to justice '
no powur which can punish any
government which is strong
enough to do whatever it damn
well pleases, Tradition and moral
right. have nothing whatever to
do with it,.

Bookstore Fouls-up Again
and Again . . .

To the I‘Idilar

Once again the bookstore has
done it. again. It has performed
in its usual fouled-up manner.
And who suffers for this gross
ineompelance‘.’ No one but. the
students.

The following is the ease in
point: a certain chemistry pro-
fessor ordered a sufficient num-
ber of books for his course. The
bookstore. howrwer, felt that the
professor was over-ordering anti
automatically eul. back his order.
The result is that one third of
the class is without a textbook.

MORE BABIES THAN CROPS

The professor then reordered
additional copies to compensate.
which still have not arrived. It is
now four Weeks into the school
year. How is the bookstore going
to compensate the students
without texts who will have a
quarter of the time to catch up
on their work if the books even
come"!

Will we, the student body,
allow this outrage to continue?
How can we. the students. fight
the FSA run monoply?

ASP Fouls-up
Again

To the Editor:

Well. the ASP has done it again.
On Oct. 3. the ASP printed a
correction for the address of
Voices in Vital America
(V.I.V.A.) which had originally
been printed incorrectly in Lynn
Axelrod's letter on Sept. 26.
However. your correction needs
to be corrected. The address of
V.|.V.A. is not 342 Madison
Ave. in Albany. but rather 342
Madison Ave.. New York. New
York. 100I7. How about trying
again. so that all those who are
interested in obtaining P.O.W.-
M.I.A. bracelets plus other as-
sorted literature. bumper
stickers. and buttons front this
fine. non-profit organization
may do so?

Sincerely yours.
