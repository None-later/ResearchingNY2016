Put a smile
on that
pumpkin

It’s the perfect autumn day:
sunny, but crisp and cool,
with the smell of burning
leaves and the colors of
changing foliage. A great
afternoon for getting into
the mood of the season and
carving out that pumpkin.
And even though it’s “that
time” of the month, you’re
feeling really happy, with a
smile as broad as the pump-
kin's. Because you
have the comfortable mm
feeling of Taman nonm
tampons’ internal sanitary
protection. And the confi—
dent feeling you get because
Tampax tampons free you
from irritation, odor and
worries. Comfort, freedom
and conﬁdence are impor-
tant to you and to women all
over the world, so it’s no
wonder more women trust
Tampax tampons to help
keep them smiling.

 
 

 

Our only lnlerut ll protecting you.

Young View of Washington

Pollution Continues

WASHINGTON—Like its prin-
ciple spokesman in the Senate,
Edmund S. Muskie (D-Me.), the
drive to conquer pollution has
experienced a meteoric rise to
oblivion.

It was predictable enough: All
the symptom were there, from
over-exposure in the press to
well-informed zealots who
brought more emotion than
facts to their argumta. As a
result, the headlines and hearings
are all but over and many of the
pollution problems remain vir-
tually untouched.

The increasing difﬁculty we
are experiencing in disposing of
solid wastes provides the most
evident example that pollution
has not subsided along with the
headlines.

Americans now discard over
250 million tons of trash annual-
ly, better than 2,000 pounds for
every citizen, and the amount is
expected to double by 1980.

Our methods of coping with
this man-made mountain contin-
ue to be astonishingly insuffi-
cient. Nearly seven months ago I
reported that 94 percent of our
nation's open dumping systems
were inadequate. Unfortunately,
that ﬁgure is still accurate today.
Moreover, three-fourths of our
municipal incinerators are not
only inadequate, they are among
the worst air pollution offend.
era.

In some urban areas the prob-
lem is already critical. In New
York City, for example, trash
diapoaal (when you can get it at
all) costs twice what it does in
most other parts of the country.
And in the next two years the
nation's largest city will have
used u all its available land fill
space. at then? Today’s tech-
nology dictates additional, ex»
pensive processing plants, and
that will raise disposal costs fur-
ther.

Faced with 250 million tons of
trash, you would think we might
take a hard look at such items as
disposable cans and bottles.
Mother Earth needs roughly 100
years to decompose completely
the average can. As for throw-—
away bottles, they become per»
manent fixtures, forever embed-
ded in a thousand forgotten land

jack anderson

ﬁlls at best, or obstructing road-
ways and stream beds at worst.

And yet, only one state—Ore-
gon—hes taken steps to discour-
age throw-away containers, and
the federal government has bare-
ly begun to study the subject
seriously.

Recycling, not only of bottles
but of virtually all our trash,
may be one answer. In New
York City alone it is estimated
that $34 million worth of scrap
could be retrieved from the
municipal flow each year.

Another possibility is hunting
trash at heats so intense that
virtually no pollution results,
and then utilizing the resulting
energy to produce, for example
electricity.

Both of these approaches are
technologically feasible today.
Indeed, recycling has been going
on for better than 50 years, and
in fact nearly half of our coun-
try's supply of copper is recover-
ed from scrap. Likewise, 30 per-
cent of all aluminum, 20 percent
of all paper and 18 percent of all
zinc.

However, because it is not al»
ways economically desirable to
recycle, government encourage-
ment will likely be needed be-
fore this approach can provide a
signiﬁcant contribution to re-
ducing the trash mountain. As
for high—intensity burning, that
too is expensive.

The first prerequisite, of
course, is increased public aware-
ness, not through emotionApack-
ed charges and counter-charges
but through a continued patient
and reasoned presentation of the
facts. As Mark Twain wrote,
“Habit is habit, and not to be
flung out of the window by any
man, but coaxed down-stairs a
step at a time."

Our habit of being careless
with trash has had decades in
which to become ﬁrmly en-
trenched. It will have to be
coaxed. That may be harder and
less dramatic than headline
splashing, and certainly it’s not
nearly so much fun. But it is the
only effective way to accomplish
a job which must be
done.

Blacks Pressure All

Black leaders in Afﬁl‘rltil and
Africa are trying quietly to per-
suade boxer Muhammad Ali not

exhibition boul in South Africa
in November.

'l‘hc day before Ali's recent
fight against It‘loydtl’uttcraon,
Ali's business manager Herbert
Muhammad, mot privately with
scvtirnl blitt'k African leaders ill. ll
cosy lunch at the United Nu-
tions. Included were Ambussu~
dor I’urali of Somali and Ambas-
sador 'I'hiun, the permanent rcp-
reacntutivc of the Organization
of African Unity.

They argued at length that
Ali’s visit would be a major
setback for opponents of South
Africa's hated policy of apur-
theid. But apparently their argu-
ments were unuvuiling. Herbert
finally shrugged and said Ali had
signed a contract and that no
one could change Ali's mind.

But the black lenders haven't
given up. They intend to appeal

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1972

to the aging leader of the Black
Muslim movement, Elijuh Mu-
hammad himself, to convince Ali
not to go to South Africa. All is

n 1 Trial: Rape

by Janice Pinchot

I couldn't go to see Arnold
Pro-kin, but Mr. Downs, Assis-
tut District Attorney, came out
to speak to me. I wanted to
know how many rapes were re-
ported in the past two years in
Albany, in how many of them
were arrests made, and how
many of those arrests resulted in
convictions of rape. Good ques-
tion he says. He couldn’t. tell me
how many were reported be
cause he didn’t get any infor-
mation unless an arrest was
made. There have been 700 felo-
nies since January 1 of this year,
and since each case is filed under
the person’s name, not type of
crime, he couldn’t supply that
information. He was able to give
me a guem for convictions; pos-
sibly ten convictions on all
counts of sexual abuse and one
conviction for rape, in two
years! it is the worst rate of

conviction for any of the felo-
nies. You just. can't. prove it to
the satisfaction of the jury. Take
a “for instance." A man breaks
into your bedroom and goes
through your jewelry case. You
wake up and scream whereupon
he clouts you and leaves. If you
can identify him, you can have
him convicted of robbery. But if
he breaks into your bedroom,
goes through your jewelry case,
clouts you when you scream and
then decides you don’t look so
bad and then rapes you, you
can’t get him for anything, even
if you can identify him. The jury
will think “you know you can’t
get him on a rape charge, so you
are making up the robbery to get
a conviction." The law and jury
seem to bend over backwards to
protect the man.

Just recently there has been a
relaxation of the law in this
respect. Article 130.15 of the
Penal Code originally demanded

Faggotales

...And so in the spring of '68,
my freshman year, I admitted to
myself that I was a nigger faggot,
and with two strikes against me
went to bat. At first it was just
Larry and 1. Larry was my clo-
sest friend who I had “revealed”
myself to, and we leaned on one
another to supply the moral
support that each other lacked.
We never went to bed, because
we wouldn't have known what
to do once we got there, so we
talked and daydreamed.

But something was bound to
change because although Larry
was the only guy friend I had, I
wasn‘t the only guy friend Larry
had. He had met others since
me, others who were older and
knew about the places gay peo-
ple gathered in Albany, inclu—
ding a her four blocks from
Draper Hall. I swore on every-
thing that I held sacred that I
would never go to that place.
Hell with a location like that
you're bound to be seen by
everyone. It took Larry and his
friends all of three weeks to talk
me into it.

it was disgusting! Guys Were
dancing together and had their
arms around one another. Some
wcrr- even kissing...on the lips no
less. There it was before me;
everything i had been raised to
fear and find disgusting. Icould
only store. After 19 years of
running away, i had returned
home...And I loved it. i danced,
laughed, I smiled and grinned,
from t: to ear. 1 was free, reully
free (0 so I thought). For the
first time i openly danced with
Larry, and We didn't pretend to
be practicing new dance steps
behind closed dorm doors. And
when we left at 2:00 to catch
the shuttle, we walked through
the snow, arm in arm, singing
the "Supremes" greatest hits

life has never been the same. I

much to belong, and be a part
of, what I then thought was
total gay life. I slowly changed
myself into a classical, young,
sophisticated, faggot.

And honey, 1 tell you now,
you should have been there!
Those were truly the “good, old,
days." Sweetheart 1 carried on
like you wouldn’t believe...An
entire new wardrobe, of course.
Coats, (Flah’s or Bloomingdales,
maxi or midi, but never mini,
leather or suede preferred), for
every ﬁve degree temperature
change. Bell bottoms, naturally.
(In those days only the moat
avant-gardc wore them). Flashy
body shirts (Pierre Cardin, who
else?) with puffy sleeves. Shoes,
(Italian and French imports on-
ly, ncuer American), with blunt
toes and “slightly” higher heels.
Jewelry galore, (sterling, rhine-
stone, or jade), but always taste-
fully worn. Hats with matching
scurfs. Knitted body-ﬁtting
swoaters (Truth and Soul), and
sunglasses for every day of the
week (Spanish or German, be
cause everyone had Italian stud
French). it cur-st me a, fortune,
but E.O.P. or no, I was a queen
determined to possess...and pos-
sess I did! (Remember girls,
where there‘s a will, there's a
definite way).

I was no longer a ore-med
major. I longed for the “Arts.” 1
mean really now, who ever heard
of a fag that didn‘t design, or
act'.’ Unfortunately I could do
neither, but all was not lost. 1
did know something "arty"...
Photography! Yes, Dorothea

gave up everything two yeurs

my feet, (or at) I thought), and
the fact that l hurl not as yet

my new life and what would
happen years from then...Well

an eyewitness (in effect) to the
rape making “uncorroborated
testimony" useless for evidence.
A woman could appear at the
local precinct black and blue
with torn clothing and sentinel
ﬂuid in her vagina, and would
still be unable to get a convic-
tion. The testimony of her body
was not enough. It could have
been just some passionate lovo-
making, and she turning women
scorned, had decided to ruin her
lovers name. And since 90% of
rapes occur without witnesses a
conviction was almost impossi-
ble. The 195th Session of the
New York State Legislature
amended article 130.15 striking
out “uncorroborated.” But that
is causing some confusion in the
D.A.'s office. Mr. Downs knows
he needs less evidence to prove a
rape occured, ut he doesn’t
know how much less. That has
to be ruled on in the courts. But
ultimately, he must have a case
that can impress the jury.

Jury of ones peers is a very
hard thing to come by. Mr.
Downs explained that he doesn’t
like to have men on the jury
because they say to themselves
“she asked for it." But women
are just as bad, saying “she could
have avoided it if she had...."
Accordingly the victim must
play the part in court. Sweet
little innocents have a better
chance in court than others. The
defendant's lawyer routinely
tries to make the victim look
promiscuous. “You led him
on,” “You asked for it," “It
wasn’t rape,” or “When you
were making love to the defen-
dant” are often part of court-
room rhetoric. And woe to you
if you knew the defendant be~
forehand. Your case is lost. Mr.
Downs estimates that approxi-
mately 50% of the victims know
their rapists.....

Most cases, though, are not
'liodéit to trial. Ninety percent
are handled through plea bar-
gaining which routinely reducm
sentences dramatically. Because
of the difficulty of making a
good case for the victim and the
impossibility of getting a con-
fession of rape from the defen-
dant, most cases are not die-
posed of satisfactorily for the
victim. Some rapists, however,
will choose to hold off for a
trial, hoping that the jury will, as
usual, find him innocent of rape.
Many women, upon finding that
their case will be going to trial
try to withdraw it, in vein. The
prosecution will not withdraw it
unless there is evidence that the
charge is false, often making
women take lie detector tests.
’I‘hey estimate 10-15% of the
rape charges are fabricated; most
jurye seem to feel that 90% are.
And this is often what keeps a
woman from reporting in rape;
the is roughly examined inter‘
nully for seminal fluid, uisked to
recount her experiences for the
precinct, the D.A.‘s office and
the jury, at least. (as well as an
explanation to her friends and
her husband), expecting to be
leered rat, at each retelling, and
then find herself being told that
it wasn't raps at all. And with no
conviction, her rapist is back on
the streets.

Mr. Downs had no advice on
protecting oneself from these
unconvicted rapists. He simply
advised not to trust strange men.
He included in this category men
