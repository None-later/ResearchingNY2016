“Parsec ” Needs You

Parsec is a science fiction mag-
azine.

Don‘t snicker, leer, or turn
away upon reading those words,
those laughable, childish words
"science-fiction," becaUse if you
do, you have no right to take up
space in overcrowded lecture
halls for the Thursday night
movies, or to curse that there is
again no way you can get into
Eng 213. (The word is “hypo-
crisy".)

You see, we had a meeting on
Monday night for anyone who
wanted to work on putting out
the fourth issuc ofParscc. it was
a well publicized meeting, with
announcements in classes and
articles in the ASP Graffiti.
Three people showed up. Among
ourselves, we decided that three
people are not sufficient to take
upon themselves the task of edit-
ing a magazine, a good magazine.
We also decided that we were
not satisfied with the last issues,
which were poorly edited and
proofread, and published morc
because thcy were “there” than

ing plecas” and men picking you
up hitch-hiking. i also include
young hippie types or straights
(most rapists are 20-30 years
old), any man you know slightly
(It is estimated that every wo-
man knows a potential rapist),
and your husband (no husband
can be convicted of raping his
wife). 80 who can you trust?

Not even in the ivory towers of
SUNYA are we safe. Mr.
William, Director of Campus
Security reports there has been
one "rape" investigated by secu-
rity in the past two years. An
arrest was made, the accused
convicted of sexual abuse, not
rape. But he adds that like other
communities rapes occur with-
out being reported. (Criminolo-
gists estimate rapes occur 10
times as often as reported). One
woman on campus that I spoke
to estimated that in a group of
20 women of which she was a
member, at least two or three
knew someone who was sexually
abused, if they had not been
abused themselves.

And perhaps it even makes
more sense to try to forget it
than go through the legal haseels
where no one will believe you
anyway. Certainly rape is a hot
topic for conversation at dinner.
Why would you even tell your
friends if you know all it was
going to boil down towns, “I'll
bet she loved it?"

So that is where we stand

morally and legally. Morslly,
good girls don't get raped (unless
they are caught with their boy-
friend when the foiks get home)
and promiscuous girls can't
(what’s the big fuss if she’s not. a
virgin?) And legally the only
jury we should have - a jury of
peers (similar victims of rape) - is
not available to us. At present, it
is not the rapist who must take
the stand, the victim must,
which allows the defense attor-
ney to question the victim's
morality, a point never in can-
test in other cases. But it is
really not the victim who is on
trial, It is the imaginary women
that is the conglomerate of
myths running rampant.

This condition has remained
with us too long. I asked Mr.
Downs what. could be done to
improve the situation. He be-
lieves that the whole corrobora-
tion ruling should be dropped as
in the Federal law, where there
is no attempt to attack the
morals of the victim; the judge
simply cautions the jury that the
victim might be making the
story up. He also impressed the
importance of immediately re~
porting the rape, thereby in-
creasing the chances of finding
seminal fluid in the vagina, al-
though he cautions there have
been many completed rapes
without an emission. But that is
like closing the corral after the
horse has escaped. indeed the
corroboration clause should be

dropped and it behoovu us to
lobby in groups or singly for
this, but we must educate as
well. We must expose such
myths as “women want to get
raped” or “nice girls don't get
raped.” We must make it known
that it is not socially acceptable
for a man to “seduce” his date.
No woman wants to have herself
exposed to a strange man who
will leave her in pain and bleed-
ing. Any woman can get taped it
she happens to be walking in the
wrong place at the wrong time,
and no one should demand psy-

works both ways; if some wo-

behavior.

Crossword Contest Rules

Puzzle solutions must be submitted to the Albany
Student Press office (CC 334) by Monday, 12 noon
following the Friday that the puzzle appears.

Name, address, phone number, and social security num-

ber must appear on your solution.

Puzzle solutions will be drawn at random until three

correct solutions have been chosen.

for two at the Patroon Room in the Campus Center (not
including liquor and tips). Dinners must be claimed

within two weeks of notification.

No one working on or for the Albany Student Press is

eligible to win.

Sorry, only one entry pcr person will be accepted.

 

 

But for now, let's get back on
the streets after dark. No, not
alone. Take nightly walks in
groups to exercise your freedom
of movement as well asto patrol
your neighborhood. A group of
five or more women is more
than safe from an attacker; they
can easily subdue one who is
attacking another woman. if
you're walking homr.l alonc wear
a hatpin, carry an umbrella (use
us a bayonet) or a whistle in
your hand. 'l‘hink ubout stamp-
ing on instcps or kicking knees.
Start really looking iit faces and
cars and practice recalling them.

These and some very good self
defense ideas come from a hook‘
let that the Women Liberation
Group on campus, as well as the
Albany chapter of N.().W. has:
“Stop Rape." We must remain-
bcr that the best way to stop
rape is to go after the problem
