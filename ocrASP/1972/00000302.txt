“Archimedio” oi RPI

An open letter to the members
of the SUNYA community:

You are warmly invited to
participate in a conference]
festival ARCHIMEDIA which
will take place on the RPI cam-
pus 12-15 October. The event
will be organized by the School
of Architecture, as a region wide
event.

The primary purpose is to try
to foster better communication
of ideas across disciplines, across
professional boundaries, across
social boundaries, and to exam-
ine how various media can help.

The program will include:

Three major lectures; work-
shops led by diverse experts;
films, experiments, demonstra-
tions, exhibits, a large Archi-
party, a dance performance, an
event at Troy Music iiall...and
you.

Among the distinguished
guests who have agreed to come
are Buckminster Fuller, Robert
Bummer (psychologist. author of

Andromeda

by David Consalves

An unmanned US. Air Force
satteiite, Scoop VII, probing for
microorganisms in outer space,
has returned to earth carrying a
powerful and deadly new or-
ganism, the Andromeda Strain.
Scoop VII lands in a small desert
town in the Southwestern U.S.
and the Andromeda Strain,
which could, if allowed to exist
unchecked, kill all existing life
on the planet. The four, with the
aid of millions of dollars worth
of scientiﬁc equipment, must
accomplish this with speed and
precision, using Scoop VII, the
old man, and the baby as their
only clues. They reach their goal
with a great deal of luck, but not
before a number of disasters
come close to destroying them,

“Personal Space”), Charles
Jencks (historian, author of
“Architecture 2000“) and Don-
ald Appleyard (planner, author
of “View From the Road”).

We intend this to be a confer-
ence of major stature. But major
conferences ILeld ,on college cam-
puses are often inaccessible to
the local communities (they read
about it in the papers). ARCHI-
MEDIA will have contributors of
national and international rc-
pute, but its major participants
are intended to be the campus
and local community members.

In line with that, ARCHI-
MEDIA will be free (except for
the Fuller talk and the dance
performance), and will be open
to all. If you want more infor-
mation about scheduling, places
to stay. whatever, please call me
at the School of Architecture,
270-6460.

Sincerely,
Alan Greenberger

John Moyail to Play of Union

Two good shows are coming
up at the Union College Chapel
this weekend: Friday nite the
pop-folk trio, Gun Hill Road,
(that opened our own POCO
concert quite well last weekend)
opens; folksinger Jim Dawson, a
friendly, mellow singer is fea-
tured. On Saturday, Glass Harp,
a rock trio from Cleveland that
mixes the populism of Mid-
western -bands with some pretty
advanced excursions into sonic
textures, will appear. Tickets for
the Glass Harp show are a real
bargain-only $1. to non-Union
students!

Women's

by Gail Ratlibun

Isn't an artist an artist, regard-
less of sex? Lawrence Alloway,
in the booklet introducing the
new show to the SUNYA Art
Gallery, suggests that the rea-
soning behind the title “New
York Women Artists" lies in the
fact that more artists who are
women are without galleries
than men who are artists, and
these thirteen women wish to
stand up and show their work
together as sisters in protest.
How about 13 “New York Men
Artists"? The! is a strange title,
but one easily changed without

Strain on Campus Tonite

and the planet.

The Andromeda Strain is a
potentially exciting science fic-
tion thriller based on the recent.
bestseller of the same name. I
say potentially exciting because
the film falls short of its mark.
This is partially due to the fact
that the book also did not live
up to its potential, but the major
fault lies with the director. The
ﬁlm starts very slowly, and its
poor pacing makes the story
drug on. While aiming for
realism, a necessary element of
the story, it never comes across
as fully as it should. The movie
is advertised as the story of
“Milli of the most critical hours
in man's history!..." and it
claims that the suspense “...will
last through your lifetime!" It’s

 

talning film.

major shortcoming, iioWevcr, is
that it lacks intensity, one
hardly ever feels that the world
is in danger of being wiped out,
although the point is stressed
over and over again. The basic
suspense ol' the movie hinges
upon this, and its failure means
that the movie lacks suspense
until its closing minutes.

The film is suvud by excellent
sets and photography, and by
consistently good acting. As a
fictional scientiﬁc suspense film
it is filled with computer bunks,
video screens, high power elec-
tron microscopes, Scientific talk,
and loads of other space age
gadgetry, uan the imaginative
scbr do an excellent job of
mixing realistic scientific
equipment with the fictional
aspects of the story. The photo—
graphy is excellent in terms of
the film's setting. The sharply
photographed, stark desert
scenes at the beginning of the
film contrast well with the
brightly lit antiseptic labora-
tories of the Wildfire Station.
The fine visuals and technical
effects help the film along, and
there Isn't one poorly acted
scene In the movie.

There are some minor political
and military aspects to The
Andromeda Strain, but don't
look 'or any messages, political
or otherwise, In the film; there
really aren't any. It is a science
fiction film made purely for
entertainment. It comes close to
failure as science fiction, but It II

second thought to “New York
Artists" title which would not
seem strange at all even if it were
noticed that all the artists were
men. (in that case the question
would become “why New York
artists?") All of which proves a
point to me, and that is we can
get so caught up in a title that
the title becomes the main object
of speculation and not the work
itself. These are thirteen talented
women. ’I‘hr J got together and
put on an exhibition of their
work. Together. That's all. And
the title that they gave it reﬂects
this simple process.

One! gallery-goer commented
at Sunday's opening that the
exhibition was most “deﬁnitely
feminine." Is this an insult?
Some will act as if there Iiad
been an affront made and de-
fend, “You only say that be-
causc you know the artists are
women, and you're looking for
so-called feminine character-
istics." Sound familiar? The de—
fense presupposes that “defini-
ter feminine" is a derogatory
,commcnt. ’l‘iie “defender”
would seem to want to deny
women the characteristics that
made art by women distinct
from that of men and give their
art identity. In distinction i can
in no way sec inequality or
inferiority.

0n the other hand, is the
comment a positive one? Was
that visitor apt in irriplying that
feminine characteristics were
apparent in all the work? What
are feminine characteristics?
Some wriuid any the art of
women is naturalistic in agree-
ment with the so-called practi-
cality of women. Others feel
that women‘s art is physically
conditioned. "A third view iii-
terprets domestic techniques,
such as sewing and kriottlng, as
an index of femininity." (View
of Paley Norvoll arid Sarah
Draney as stated by Alloway.)
The ﬁrst two views may apply to
both men and women artists; I
don’t feel that the realm of the
naturalistic and physically eon-
ditioned nor of the practical is
solely that of the women. Men,
however, are not by J'“

at Gallery

ing in touch with domestic tech-
niques. I cannot imagine
a male artist execut-
ing Norvell's printed vinyl ruf-
fles, so closely is it linked with
sewing techniques. (It also re-
minded me of too many dishes
done while staring out the guy
vinyl-curtained window over the
sink--an experience not familiar
to most men.) Paula Tavins’
“Snow Princess” of small bags
sewn to canvas and painted ran-
dome with magna is another
example demonstrating the
domestic technique theory. And
Sarah Draney makes her slender
leaning branches comply with
the theory when she wraps
colored thread around them. She

is in ii sense making them hers’

(not his) with this thread-
wrapping.

Is other work shown, then, not
“definitely feminine"? Yes, I
believe that it is not. My gallery-
goer was generalizing, and I can
buy Norvell's and Druriey's idea
of the feminine in art. “llung
1-4” by Sharon Gilbert and
"White Moth" (which hovers in
space over the exhibition) by
Audrey Hemenway are two of
m y' favorite works as well as the
aforementioned, but they do not
strike me as peculiarly feminine.
They don't fit my new, narrow
criteria. (Someone did comment,
however, that “liurig 1-4" rc-
minded hor of “dilapidated
diaphragma." if indeed this was
Gilbert's inspiration, ii new cri
toria for feminine art may have
been suggested.)

The exhibition dominating thr-
lower hqu of the gallery is
“Photography Canada." As
usual, the gallery crew has done
a good job of presenting the
highly journalistic work of this
varied Canadian group. The
majority of the photographs are
straightforward, quality, 111') rrriri.
black and white protraits and
“slices of life." The main fault
of this exhibit is too much of
the same thing. The small color
photographs provide little relief
from the sameness of subject
matter and technique. Strieter
selection might have given this
show more punch than lt throws
