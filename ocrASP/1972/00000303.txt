The quivalent Of 7 Hiroshim Aombs
Are Being Dropped On

Indochina Each And Every Month

And that's after six years of protest!

Explosives equal to 420 Hiroshima A-bombs have already
been dropped on Vietnam.

Millions of men, women and children have been killed,
maimed or left homeless as a result of the bombing.

——(Ilul this is what President Nixon calls (I policy of "great
restraint"!

He tells us he is winding down the war — and then says that
unless North Vietnam accepts his terms. there will be no re-
duction of the bombing. (As a matter of fact, there will prob-
ably be a further escalation.)

“Those who have had a chance for four years and could not
produce peace, should not be given another chance,” Nixon,
October 9, I968.

On this October 9th, it will be [our years. Can our conscience

stand the guilt of another [our years 0/ this kind of immoralil y
under Richard Nixon?

American conscience to care only about US. casualties, not
about the lives of Vietnamese.

Do we really not care about the people we kill?

Americans will not always be able to ignore the consequences
of our actions. We will be asked: How could it happen? Where
were you? What did you do?

I '1 Just protesting is not enough.

[ ] Voting your conscience ll" not enough.

Your dollars are crucial. Your dollars can .t'lop Ihe killing. Make
it possible for George McGovern to awaken the people before
November 7.

President McGovern would end the war.

People of conscience must make this final sacrifice: contribute
your utmost!

Regardless of where the
“seniors” live, certain problems
are inevitable. The lack of kit-
chen facilities would be a serious
handicap since elderly people
generally enjoy preparing meals
and are not accustomed to insti-
tutional food. To the "seniors,"
stairs may be an inconvenience,
fire drills a harrowing experi-
ence, and the gentle vibes of

modern theories and techniques.
Accordingly, they may feel intel-
lectually intimidated by their
younger classmates.

Despite this pessimistic evalua-
tion, I do believe that housing
senior citizens on campus could
result in a mutually beneﬁcial
cultural exchange if we take‘care
to make some preparations. Of
primary importance is the con-
sultation of the student body by
the administration before taking
any action on the program. Fail-

pus lies not so much in the
situation itself, but with our
motives and initiative in pursu-
ing the project. If we can look
beyond our economic needs and
are willing to make some accom-
modations and sacriﬁces in order
to serve both groups I believe
that a rewarding cltural experi-
ence can be achieved. The cri-
tical question which we must ask
ourselves is “are we willing?"

feelings of resentment and hos-

Several alterations in the physi-
cal layout of facilities and in the
university's professional and
non-professional stuff would be
necessary. Kitchen and residence
facilities must be investigated
and accomodated to meet the
needs of the senior citizens. An

Should presently vacant dorms
be used to house senior citizens?
There are a number of points to
be made on both sides of this
issue. I will first consider the
drawbacks of the proposal, and
while you may consider them
insigniﬁcant, I surely do.

Let us assume that we are
living on campus with one hall
on each quad ﬁlled with senior
citizens. It is a proven fact that
senior citizens are considerably
less agile than younger students.
How would the "senior" be able
to dodge the frisbeea, the foot-

ceivors who run with abandon
on the quads?

And what about fire drills?
Any State Quad resident knows
that those buzzers would wipe
out half the senior citizen dorm.
with coronary arrests. Which
leads to other problems. Are we
to expect the ASP, budgeted for
too little space as is, to produce
a weekly obituary page?

The list of minor problems is
endless. Most students here are
worried about their future, their
careers, and therefore we usually
spend the darkness hours in our
rooms studying. The senior citi-
zen, with few of those concerns,
would probably prefer partying
at night. Their loud parties
might force multitudes of young
students to the library where the
noise problem is already out of
control.

Finally, the problem of mixed
dating must be considered. In
this ease, I will attempt to speak
for the male students on cam-
pus. We all know how old men
go for young women. Who does
that leave us with? You guessed
it! And what about the loose
sexual mores of senior citizens
that we've all heard so much
about? After all, what do they
care about a reputation? Fellow
male students, as protectors- of
the purity and virtue of our
female classmates, can we let
this happen?

Okay. So much for the argu
ments against the proposal. To
consider the positive aspects of
this proposal, 1 must be serious,
because when you stop to think
about it, it is a fine idea.

is ﬁlled with some activity, some ‘
meaning, this problem becomes
all the more serious. Living on”
campus would allow the senior
citizen to be involved in a'
young, healthy, stimulating at-
mosphere.

We, too, stand to gain from
such a proponal. While campus
life provides a pleasant respite
from the real world, a little
diversity around here surely
would not hurt. Sometimes I
almost forget that the very old,
and very young exist. With
senior citizens living on the
quads, campus life would be
more interesting, more varied,
and a little more real. Wouldn't
it be nice to talk with a spritely
septugenarian once in a while?
Maybe all those years on earth
has given him something valu-
able to share with us.

Finally, not too many senior
citizens would be able to make
such a move. The senior citizen
living here would be the one
with motivation, the one flexible
enough to try it, In a sense, they
would be the cream of the crop.
So I say, let‘s let 'em in.

The “gray lib" movement lives.

To the survivors, our light to contain communism in Southeast

oppose.
