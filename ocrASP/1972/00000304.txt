“They scared the living hell

Hutton Valley coach Burr
Reeves expressed this feeling
about the Niagara football club
that his team clashed with last
weekend.

Although the Vikings were
able to dump the Niagara Purple
Eagles 27-0, the first half of play
saw a battle of defenses as nei-
ther team was able to score.

Speaking at the weekly lun-
cheon of area coaches and sport's
media, Reeves found two atten-

The Hudson Valley squad wit-
nessed a defensive show last
Saturday but the Albany
Gridders can also expect to see a
sound offfensive performance by
the Purple Eagles.

The Niagara offense will fea-
ture three men who have played
together all through high school
and college - quarterback John
Scotto, and running backs Ed
Renica and Bob Ruth.

“Scotto really hurt us last
year,” observed Ford. “He’s a
fantastic scrambler and an ac—
curate passer. He seems to pass
the best when he's under'pres-
sure.”

Renica, who was named Nia-
gara's Most Valuable Player in
1971, led the club in rushing
yardage.

The senior covcaptain also han-
dled several defensive duties
throughout the schedule.

Ruth, another power runner,
received the Most Valuable Back
award in 1970.

“They’re a funny team," con-
tinued Ford. “They have a num-
ber of guys who play many
positions. You‘re never sure
where they're going to be. Quar-
terback John Scotto, for exam-
ple, has also seen action at offen-
sive and defensive tackles.”

The Great Danes will find out
mtlytho‘w sneaky the Purple
Eagles are tomorrow night at
7:30 in Niagara.

Vinnie Reds and Nick De
Marco led a powerful Albany
team over R.P.I. and Sicna in a
cross country meet held last
Wednesday.

This was built up by the local
papers as a meet between Al-
bany and RPI and a race be-
tween two of the top runners in
the area, Siena's Joe
Rukanshegiza and Albany‘s own
Vinnie Reda.

Boaters Play
Great But Lose

by Nathan Salant

Albany‘s bootmen went down
to their third defeat of the year,
versus Oneonta, but played one
of the greatest games an Albany
soccer team has ever played. The
game ended with a score of 4-0,
but the score was meaningless.
The only thing that truer mat-
tered was that unranked, 6 goal
underdog, Albany had held the
team many people consider to
be number 2 in the state, to just
1 goal for the first 80 minutes of

play.
Albany used a totally new
game plarr—' - - man to man

coverage with one free fullback
who worked as a sweeper. The
name of the game was to be
defensive and not offensive. Al-
bany was to go for breakaways
only—no sustained offensive
drives. It was the only way to
defeat a team like Oneonta, a
team consisting of 2 All-
Americans, a new player, Furouk
Karishl, who is one of the best
soccer players in America, a
team which has averaged 7 goals
a game, a team that has been
undefeated for the past two sea-
sons ofleague play.

The game opened with what
was to be the dominant feature
of the game—Oneonta on of-
fense, and Albany playing tough
defense. The Oneonta forwards
Were constantly bringing the ball
up, only to be forced to pass.

who promptly booted the ball

game plan.

As the game progrcsscd, OncA
onta became disorganized—they
wcrc not used to a 0-() score.
The pressurc was really on them,
and things lookcd great for Al
bany, when our old nemisis
struck :1 questionable call by
ref. With [:15 to go in the first
half, an Onconta attack was bro-
kcn up via a sliding tackle by
Albany dcfcnscman Mark
Solanu. As Solano fell, his hand
accidentally touched the ball,
and the rcfs faked us out by not
calling :1 pcnalty (which was
actually a good call), however,
when he got up, his elbow
touchcd the ball, and ref farthest

hand hall must be intentional.

llwsc kicks. The half ended with
the Danes trailing H)

in thc second half Albany
came out playing that same
dogged, tough dcfensc, and the
scorc stayed at H) until, with
less than 10 minutes to play,
Farouk Karishi scored on a fluke
goal. At this point, after playing
such strong defense for so long,
the Albany defense collapsed,
ﬁnally yielding two goals to a far
superior team,

Football—Albany vs. Niagara

The Danes, who are flying high after their opening
victories over Stony Brook and RIT, travel to

Niagara tomorrow night.

Albany has shown a strong running attack out of
the wishbone-T, coming up with stars like McCoy
Allister and Marvin Perry. John Bertuzzi proved that
he can complete a pass, one a 78 yard touchdown

pass to Bob Baxer.

The defense has really gelled. Co—captain Arnie
Will was outstanding against RIT assisting on 2i
tackles. The defense has permitted just 17 points in
their last five games dating back to last year.

Niagara, 1-2 lost to Hudson Valley last week.
Returning from last years squad that Albany best
are quarterback John Scotto, halfback Ed Renica,
fullback Ron Tuholsky and halfback Bob Ruth.

They have an explosvie offense.

The night game shouldn't bother the Dane offense
since the ball is hardly thrown but the defensive
secondary might have some problems seeing the hall

in the lights.

Prediction: Albany, 28; Niagara, 14.

Soccer ~Albany vs. Cortland

'l‘lie hooters are having problems scoring this year
as they were shutout for the second time this year.
They now stand 0-2 in SUNYAC play. Last year

Cortland beat Albany 3-],

Prediction. Cortland, ll; Albany, 2.

To quote Coach Wingert, “We
have nothing to be ashamed of—
There's nothing the be ashamed
of when you hold a team of
Onconta's quality to just four
gualr'thc fcwcst they've scored
this season, We played superbly,
There's nothing else to say ex‘
cept that this was one of the
greatest games Albany has ever
played." The team was In total
agreement with the coach, and
