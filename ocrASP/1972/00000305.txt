by Ken Arduino

The defending champion Pitts-
burgh Pirates take on the Cincin-
nati Reds this Saturday after-
noon when the National League
playoffs; begin. Oakland will take
on Detroit in the American
League playoffs also this Satur-

day.

Both the Reds and the Pirates
have explosive offenses while
their pitching has been suspect.
Both teams won their respective
divisions easily.

The Reds are sparked by
Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan.
Morgan was acquired in an off
season trade and just might be
the Reds M.V.P. He's a top
hitter and is one of the top base
stealers in baseball. Along with
Pete Rose and Bobby Tolan, he
gets on base for Bench.

Last year Bench had a horrible
year. But this year he has made
up for it by being among the top
homerun hitters and RBI men all

year. Tony Perez follows Bench
in the order forcing the opposi-
tion to pitch to him.

Cincinnati pitching has some
question marks. Gary Nolan, the
ace of his staff, has been injured

but is expected to start; his
effectiveness is in doubt. Don
Gullet, Wayne Simpson and Jack
Billingham have all been erratic
in starting roles. Ross Grimsley

the other possible starter is in
only his first full season.

The ball pen is exceptional
with .all-starl- Clay Carroll.
Carroll just set the major league
record for saves’with 36. Pedro
Barbon and Tom Hall back him
up.

The Piratm'. ace Steve Blass also
has an injury problem. He was
hit with a line drive last Satur-
day but is expected to start. Doc
Ellis, Nelson Briles, Bob Mouse,
and Bruce Kison are five solid
starters. Dave Giusti and Ramon
Hernandez lead a good bullpen.

Roberto Clemente leads a phe-
nomenal hitting attack which
sees .300 average hitters sitting
on the bench. Willie Stargell, Al
Oliver, Rich Hebner, and Manny
Sanguillen are all all-stars and
top hitters. Pittsburgh also has
the top bench in baseball with
three hundred hitters like Vic
Davilillo and Richie Stennet.
These men though will see as
much action as the starters.

NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAG

by Bruce Maggin

The National Hockey League
opens its 1972 season tomorrow
night with a host of player chan‘
ges and two new teams. Because
of the formation of the rival
World Hockey Association,
many players have left the NHL.
The two new teams are the
Atlanta Flames and the New
York Islanders.

It's been over thirty years since
the Ncw York Rangers last
drank champagne from the Stun-
iey Cup. This could finally be
the year. With the player losses
of Boston, New York must rank
as solid favorites to take the
Cup.

The Rangers are a solid team
from top to bottom but they
might be a little weak on defense
because Jim Nielsen is out for
three weeks with a broken bone
in his foot. Look for Couclr GM
Emilc Francis to make a trade to
plug this gap. Brad Piirk ranks as
the second best dcfcnscman in
the league and was outstanding
with Team Canada In their series
against Russia Rod Sciling is oni-
of the most under rated defense

man. The Rangers are set in goal
with Ed Giacomin and Gil Vill-
mieure, two of the best.

Upfront New York possesses
the top scoring line in the NHL
in All-Stars Vic Hadfield, Jean
Ratellc and Rod Gilbert. Walter
Tkuzuk ranks as a coming super
star. Barring injuries, New York
should go all the way.

The Montreal Canadians are a
young club but seem to be a
year away. Ken Dryden is a
super goaltender but Montreal
must find a backup for him. The
loss of J.C. 'I‘remblay to the
WHA is going to hurt but Serge
Siivard seems ready to take over
the leadership on the blue line

The Boston Bruins have I)t‘l'll
hurt very badly by defections to

On paper Oakland may have
the best team in baseball. Reggie
Jackson is a great hitter but has
been hampered by injuries as has
Dick Green. Sal Bando has not
had the year he is capable of
having. It‘s been Mike Epstein
and Joe Rudi who havetaken up
the slack and kept Oakland in
front of Chicago. Matty Alou
and Don Mincher lead a solid
bench.

Vida Blue, ‘ahtild out through
Max, has not pitched as well as
he did last year. Oakland cannot
rely on him again. The burden is
shifted to Jim Hunter, John
Odom and Ken Holtzmiin; these
men will have to do the job. The
bullpen is a good one with three
solid pitchers in Darold
Knowles, Rollie Fingers, and
Bob Locker.

The Detroit Tigers battled to
the second to last day of the
season before winning the pen-
nant. They have to be tired.
Mickey Lolich, Woody Fryman

and Joe Coleman are the Starting
pitchers. They will have to do
the job as the second ljrie pitch-
ing is rather weak. Fred Scher-
man leads an average bullpen.

The offense is led by veteran
Al Kaline, who was benched by
injuries early in the year. But
during the stretch drive it was
Kaline who became the hottest
hitter and is now over 300. The
injury to Bill Freehand is a
tough blow to the Tigers but
they caught the Red Sex with—
out him and Duke Sims and
Tom Haller filled in admirably.
Norm Cash and Willie Horton
will have to supply the power
and fielding magician Ed Brink-
man will lead a tough dcfensivu
team.

If games were won on pnpcr
Oakland would be the choice to
beat Detroit. But on the field it's

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 6. I972

may be Wondering what a wo-
man who’d remind you of your
grandmother was doing hitching
downtown in the middle of the
night after seeing the horror
movies at SUNYA. Our hitching
luck wasn’t good at all, so I got
the chance to talk to this de-
lightful lady for more than an
hour and found her to be ex-
tremely sharp, knowledgeable,
and wonderfully energetic. When
we finally got to Alumni Quad,
someone got his car and we
drove her home near the Palace
Theatre, in one of Albany’s
older sections. I resolved to see
her again.

I decided to choose to inter-
view Ruth when I learned of the
proposal to house senior citizens
in Vacant dorms at SUNYA to
relieve the loss of revenue due to
the student migration off-
campus. Ruth and I had talked
about the University and how
she, as a senior citizen and a
member of the neighboring com-
munity, benefited from State.
She travels to the uptown cam-
pus about twice a week, and
hardly ever misses the weekend’s
activities. Her favorite pasttimes
here are attending both the regu-
lar and experimental theatrical
productions at the Performing
Arts Center, sitting in on as
many lectures as she can, and
viewing the various movies pre—
sented here. Ruth takes great
advantage of the theatre “Nd
movies at a cost her pocketbook
can afford. She also reads the
ASP regularly. On the surface,
Ruth seems like a good candi»
date for on campus housing. She
lives alone, is looking for low
cost housing in a nicer neighbor-
hood, iind certainly uses State to
the fullest.

When the proposal is reduced
to basics, however, serious proli-

lems arise. Senior citizens would
be on campus to take college
level courses in the College of
General Studies. Ruth finished
high school, but never made it to
college in the Depression years.
She has considered taking
courses several times in the past,
but would prefer auditing them
instead of competing for grades
in a pressure-packed atmosphere.
I would suspect this sentiment
to be widespread. At this point
in their lives, senior citizens may
value learning more than a 3.5
GPA and a piece of rag for a
degree.

As far as SUNYA goes, a major
decision will be the location of
the housing. Ruth is against liv-
ing on the uptown campus. Her
reason—"isolation." Living in
“Stone City" could strand the
"seniors" on a slab of concrete,
out of reach of shopping facili-
ties and the city of Albany,
where they could relate more to
the familiar people and places.
The noise and lifestyle of stu-
dents could easily disturb the
elderly, says Ruth. She objected
also the the suite system, citing
the elderly's preference for pri«
vacy, and doubting seriously
whether six senior citiznns, with
their complex needs, could get
along. Food would be another
problem. Allhough Ruth said
she would enjoy not having to

Steve Meyer

  

prepare all of her meals, she
doubted that seniors could eat
the spicy food served here, stat-
ing their option for blandness in
their diet.

The downtown campus solves
some of these problems, but
creates others. The ‘ r“
is more refreshing and tranquil,
and the dorms are across the
street from the city of Albany—a
major factor. Seniors would not
have to put up with the uptown
tulmult but would be con-
fronted instead with the big has-
sle of downtown living: the bus.
Last winter, I stood in -16 de-
grees cold for half an hour be-
fore the bus came. Our elderly
friends simply cannot take the
strenuous bus route day in and
day out, not to mention the
crush at 8:45 am. and the 2:00
bus in the afternoon. Ruth, a
veteran of the SUNY buses, says
many of her age group could not
stand the ordeal. If separate
transportation can be arranged,
this problem may be circum-
vented. Another possibility
would be to hold all their classes
in the downtown area.

Ruth said she loves little chil-
dren, iind would consider volun—
teering for the Day Care Center
in Pierce Hall downtown. The
great advantage senior citizens
hiive is their worldliness and
years of experience in day-to-
day living. Their help could be
used in any number of campus
projects.

Unfortunately, one of the big-
gest objections Ruth Iias is the
tremendous change this would
be in her life. She says the
elderly would think twice Iii-fortl
radically altering their lives at so
late a juncture. The changes in
volvcd scare Ruth, and she is
unsure if she would make the
decision to move that would
alter the way she lives; it is a
pattern deeply ingrained in her
by now.

 

The roadblocks to success that
drop up In the proposal are
numerous and vital. Even if a
goodly number of senior citizens
would participate in the, pro«
gram, we must solve problems of
the location of the housing, and
the ' " “_ L ‘ young
and old. The uptown campus
seems unrealistic; downtown is
more feasible, but questionable
at best. Additionally, SUNY of-
ﬁcials must get more feedback
from the elderly. Ruth and her
peers merit a greater chance to
express their views on what
could be a momentouqstepln the
alleviation of Albany’s senior
citizen problem.

At a first glance, the housing
of senior citizens in our vacant
dormiton appears to be an ideal
solution to our complementary
economic problems. The elderly
suffer a critical shortage of ade-
quate, moderate priced housing
while SUNYA is in a period of
ﬁnancial difficulty, partially due
to the trend towards off campus
housing and the resulting decline
in revenue.

The merger of our academic
community with that of our
elders has possibilities beyond
the economic realm. Both
groups have much to learn
through the exchange of experi-
ences and ideas. Our "seniors"
would have the opportunity to
become involved in educational
pursuits regardless of wiiethcr or
not they chose to do so on a
formal levcl. Campus organiza-
tions and activities furnish
another area for their recreation
and growth. Living on campus,
“seniors” could enjoy the con-
Vcnicncc of the library, the art

allery and the gymnasium a
could attend the numerous cou-
certn, films. and lectures pro-
vided for the enrichment and
enjoyment of the university
community. Similarly our or-
ganizations and Day Care Center
can beneﬁt from their. experi-
ence.

However, along with the posi-
tive pouiblilitiu there are I few
features of our campus and some
differences between the two age
groups which might hamper the
success of the proposed living
experiment. On the most basic
level our dorm facilities may not
be functionally adequate for el-
derly people. While the uptown
campus is convenient it is iso-
lated from the outside com-
munity. For senior citizens the
close proximity of shopping/"Id
houses of worship is not a con-
venience, but a necessity. A walk
from State Quad to Stuyvesant
Plaza can be more of an ordeal
than an outing for an older
person, particularly during the
colder seasons.

The suite system has its obvi-
ous limitations if it is to be used
for housing senior citizens. Oc-
cupancy would necessarily be
restricted to unmarried
"seniors." Even if the suites are
shared by "single" members of
the same sex I would seriously
question whether elderly people,
who generally spend a substan-
tial amount of time in their
residences and rooms, would
find that this arrangement allows
for enough privacy.

Housing our “seniors” on the
downtown campus has its own
problems. While Alumni Quad is
conveniently located for contact
with and access to the outside
community, it would make it
necessary for our new residents
to commute uptown for classes
and activities. In a way, this
would defeat the purpose of
housing them on campus in the
