in relation to the article written by Bill Brins of
your staff concerning the lsaac ljaye’s show, i

' would like it to be known that this particular critic ‘
is obnoxious himself. - ’

From this particular critique of the ASP 10/3/72,
it is obvious that this writer is white. It is obvious
that he could not relate to the performance because
of his being whitell

in, the article, the critic mentioned about a
dancing girl. Well, for your information, this so- V
called dancing girl was lbien Washington; a young
lady whom lsaac Hayes took into custody who was
formally serving a sentence in prison. l-kr being on
stage was to let the people be aware that she was the
one so many had heard about; also her purpose was
to bring Isaac Hayes on stage.

The following statement that this writer wrote is
totally untrue: “That kind of a buildup places an
enormous strain on the performer to deliver excite-
ment on an energy level of the introduction, and
Isaac just couldn’t do it". When lsaac Hayes spoke
that night, his first words, the ﬁeld house was quiet.
Isaac Hayes was like a god with command over his
people.

Another quote which is untrue: “The Black
Moses, l’m afraid he is not, and the ponderous
manner in which he now performs his own music is
fast transforming what was once a considerable
talent into a Black Sominex." For anyone to sell as
many albums as Mr. Hayes did and to write the
musical score for the film Shaft, and to win a
Grammy award is a great accomplishment. For
anyone to make a statement like Brina did is
nothing but an ASSN The only way lsaac Hayes
could become a “Black Somincx" is if POOR critics
like you are kept on the staff of this or any

newspaper Since you, Brina, couldn’t relate to the
performance of issue Hayes, you should have stated
it in your article, instead of giving a critique which
is total“Y “Mine” Craig Martin Jenkins

 Hollis Frampton will
show and discuss his films. His
works seem to resemble logical
hypotheses, propositions and ul-
timately paradoxes. They are
more intellectual than any films
within the American avant-garde
since Sidney Petersen. He has
become incredibly proliﬁc, like
Brakhage and Warhol in their
most radical periods. The speed
and quantity of his productions
have qualified, contradicted and
engulfed all his past work.

His work is m various fronts
creating visual polomies and ex,
perimenting in style. One of his
latest films, Zarn'a Lemma, is an
exercise in mathematical logic In
the cinema, a film about struc-
ture and rhythm. Critics Jonas

efforts as major poetic works.

1200 Hear Fonda Al Gym

Although the turnout was con-
siderably larger than expected,
students were only moderately
enthusiastic as they welcomed
Jane Fonda to the Albany cam-
pus last night. The crowd of
1200 which greeted the famed
actress-tnrned-political-activist
gave their polite attention and
silent support; but for n few
outbursts, there was little excite-
ment in the gym. it was a far cry
from the day when an over»
ﬂowing crowd shook the walls
of the gym in support of Bill
Kunstler.

Fonda, touring aspart of the
Indochina Peace Campaign with
Tom Hayden, folksinger Holly
Neer, and ex-POW George Snith,
drew on her own experiences as
an actress and also on her recent
visit to Vietnam in an attempt to
make the war once again a per-
sonal issue. Although the
speeches seemed rhetorical and
too familiar to some, most of
the audience was impressed by
the sincerity and concern with
which Fonda and the others
spoke.

The evening's activities began
as Holly Neer, a Los Angeles-
based folksinger who accom-
panied Fonda to North Vietnam,
interspersed anti—war songs with
her account. of the trip. She
spoke of the deep—rooted culture
of the Vietnamese people, and
her refrain, “Hang in there a
little bit longer," dedicated to
the women of Vietnam, also
seemed a plea to the audience to
continue anti-war activities.

Neer was followed by ex-POW
George Smith, who detailed the

Group Tours Capital District

Antiwar actress Jane Fonda
said Monday that during her
tour of North Vietnam she saw
women whose bodit's were cov-
ered with pellets from U.S. anti-
personnel bombs, and childrcn
who lost arms and leg»; from
picking up “bomblels” dropped
from American planes.

Speaking at 'l‘roy's Emma Wil-
lurd School, from which shc wus

fair treatment he received in the
POW camps. Captured in 1963,
Smith advocated that the North
Vietnamese policy on prisoners
was the same then as it is now:
“The prisoners will be kept until
the end of the war; when the
war ends they will be released."
He supported the Seven-Point
Peace Plan, and asked the and-
ience to help him convince “the
ones that don’t believe" of the
truth about the war.

While Smith was an interesting
speaker, most of the eyes in the
gym were on Fonda, who
throughout the speech sat on the
podium, nervously eyeing the
crowd. Greeted by cheers as she
rose to the rostrum, the pretty
actress, dressed in bluejeans and
an lndian shirt, began with the
Nixon quote much-used by
McGovern supporters, “Anyone
who is given four years chance
and couldn't end the war
shouldn't be given another
chance." Confronting the aud-
ience with the staggering figures
of those killed, wounded or
made homeless in Vietnam in
the last four years, she defended
her visit to North Vietnam,
claiming that she was denied
entrance to South Vietnam and
was only assuming her responsi-
bility to get at the truth. Yield-
ing to Hayden, she noted the
absurdity in the fact that “You
can get an academy award for a
false role in a movie but are
indicted for treason if you speak
your views as an American citi-
7.en." ’l‘he crowd‘s applause sig-
nalled agreement.

Fonda went on to criticize

graduated in 1955, Ms. Fonda
said "half" the bombs U.S.
planes drop on North Vietnam

small bombs “which can't des-
troy military targets, whose only
target is human flesh."

Vietnamization (“it assumes a
cynical view of the American
people...that as long as yellow
people are the ones killed we
won’t care") and the continued
bombing of North Vietnam,
which mairns those “most vul-
nerable—women, children, and
the aged."

Describing the first thirty-two
years of her life as “wasted.”
Fonda said that she too was
“apathetic” and "cynical." But
she insisted that if we let things
go on as they are now, “We will
have lost the ability to think for
ourselves. We may be doomed to
skim the surface of our lives for
the rest of our lives...lf we can-
not feel for the Vietnamese peo—
ple how can we feel for any-
body?”

The Peace Campaign group,
though blasting Nixon, came
short of endorsing McGovern,
claiming that they wanted to
remain independent of politics
and personalities. But Hayden
did stress during questioning,
that McGovern's position is the
one that is generally accepted,
and that his plan for ending the
war is the only one. He said he
was sorry about the fact that a
lot of people are talking about
voting for McGovern but few are
working for him. But this in-
action, judging from the eve-
ning's responses, should not.
seem unusual. if it wasn't for the
glamour of Jane Fonda (and the
added surprise attraction of Don
Sutherland in the audience), it is
questionable whether there
would have been much student
response at all.

tons of bombs the United States
dropped all over the world dur-
ing World War 11," she said,
quoting Defense Department stav
listies.

“The equivalent of Hiroshima
is rained on those people every
five days," she declared.

Ms. Fonda said before she be-
came active in the antiwar move-
ment she refused to believe the
US. government “could do such
things."

With the academy-award-
winning actress on her tour of
campuses Ill the Albany area
Monday was long-time political
activist and Students for a De-
mocratic Society founder Torn
Hayden.

He said til it speech before
1,500 students at Siena College
in nearby Loudunville that “the
administration tells us the war is
winding down when, in fact, it's
never been higher, more devas-
tuting, more destructive.”

Hayden said he and Ms. Fonda
are part of a group known as the
lndochinu Pence Campuign,
which he tiilld trims ui “exposing
clcurly the contradiction be-
lWl'i‘ll what the administration
says and what's really happen-
ing "

Mn. Fonda called on the uudi~
t'nct‘ ut Emma Willard to bring
pressure on newspaper editors to
tell “what really is going on in
Vietnam." She said the truth
about the war “is being kept
from its—the government is lying
and deceiving its own people."

As tillt.‘ concluded her talk at
the private git'ls‘ high school
here, she said “it's nice to come
brick. it was on this stage where
l acted for the first time in my
life. it's nice to do something
real for u change."
