Inside Look At A Nixon Man

by Nancy Albaugh

“Nixon I] going to win by the
biggee't‘ landslide ever."

These words are not the pro-
phesy of a Jeanne Dixon, nor
determine the location of the
incumbent's victory. Instead
they reﬂect the belief of Dan
Duncan, President of the Albany
State Young Republicans.

Working in conjunction with
the Albany area Committee to
Re-Elect the President, the
SUNYA group has about a
125 student-membership. They
have been involved with can-
vassing area residents, finding
out if they are pro-Nixon, and if
so, if they are registered to vote,
although as Dan said, “I've been
putting in more time for the
local candidates."

Right now, higher emphasis is
placed on the local candidates
because “most of the people feel
that Nixon is so far ahead we
don't bother them. We don't
want to put on too much
pressure and make them change
their minds...we'll hold off until
the last two or three weeks
before the election and then hit
them."

The “main thing” committee
members have been doing is
manning the 24 telephones at
the 855 Central Avenue head-
quarters from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
“We've been calling mostly regis-
tered Republicans and asking
them to donate time and
money."

This is not to say that the
old-fashioned door'to-door cam-
paigning is being dismissed. On
the cold, miserable, rainy Satur-
day he was Called by the ASP,
Dan had to postpone the inter-
view because he had to save two
such ardent campaigners waiting
for him on a street corner from
contracting pneumonia. “Can I
call you back'.’ I think they
might be just crazy enough to be
out there."

Why Nixon

Dan sees many reasons why
the student should vote for
Nixon.

“This Is the first time in 20
years that we've been spending
more money on human re-
sources than on the military," he
stated.

The Vietnam issue is handled
better by Nixon, Dan feels.
“McGovern's thing is to nego-
tiate out of a position of weak-
ness...if someone has the upper
band, sure they'll give you a raw
deal."

Dan also points out that Nixon
has arranged for an all-volunteer

army. Next year "a lot of 18
year olds don't have to worry
about the draft after June 30.
By July 1...there'll be an all-
volunteer army."

An issue that McGovern has
been criticizing Nixon about is
the unemployment. Rut Dan
says, “It seems to me that when
you bring 600,000 men out of
Vietnam, of course/you'll have
unemployment. And with com-
panies like Boeing and Lockheed
cutting back, you have more
people out of jobs.” Dan has
confidence that Nixon will lower
the rate of unemployment, but
that it will take some time.

Nixon's world policies have
been good, Dan thinks. “And
then there are the Russia and
China trips—they signify his
working for world peace and
unity.“

Dan blames much of the male-
dministration of the government
on the Democratic Congress.
They have refused many of
Nixon‘s proposals, the major one
being the guaranteed minimum
wage proposal.

“One thing kids at State would
be interested in," Dan states, "is
Nixon‘s support of Israel. The
lsraeli ambassador to the US
came out and said that he
thought Nixon should be sup-
ported in the next term.’I Dan
states that Nixon is doing well
with ii any Jewish businessmen.

Like most Catholics, Dan
favors Nixon‘s stand on abor—

tion. “Well I like his stand. I
think it's a good one, being
against abortion.” He went on to

give his personal views on abor‘

tion and then stated “Nixon is
doing well with Catholics also
because of this issue."

The drug problem is still a
major issue concerning us.

"Nixon is trying to cut down on

the drug traffic. I guess he's

made agreements with Turkey
and other places. I personally
think that no one should make
money of other people’s habits.

And the up. line —that's a

pretty good thing. I wouldn't

mind 500 bucks..."

The SUNYA Support

Dan stated that Republican
support has grown over the past
two years at SUNYA. "In the
'70 campaign for Senator Buck-
ley, we took surveys...and only 3
people out of 200 sampled said
that they were Republicans, This
year it's a lot higher Wc'Ve been
doing surveys in thr- dinncr lies.
and I'd say l2 to 15 people of

200 say they're Republicans."
Why such a small number?
“Well, I think a lot of people
don't like to come out and say
that they're for Nixon when
there are a bunch of other
people around...l think they
know Nixon's going to win by a
landslide so they don’t bother to
come out for him.” 12 to 15 out
of 200 is “not too hot, but it‘s
better than just 2 or 3." Dan
feels that many people haven’t
made up their minds yet, and
when they do, many more WIII
support Nixon.

Another promising aspect
about election '72’ for Nixon is
that Rockefeller is also working
for the cause. Dan feels this
shows more New York State
support than ever before. I

When/asked whether the Fri-
day ASP editorial in support of
McGovern would make a dif-
ference in the student vote at
SUNYA, Dan replied, “I can't
see whether it will make a dif»
ference or not who the paper
supports." He added, “Why
should our mandatory student
tax go to support McGovern?"

Dan first became involved in
the campaigning for candidates a
years ago with the 1964 Presi-
dential campaign. “I got in-
volved in the Goldwater cam-
paign when I was Freshman in
high school, and I really thought
he was going to win...He was
honest and lliked him."

“(nice at Albany lwas a mem
ber of Young Americans for
Freedom, being chairman at
one time. ...But it got a littlc
too conservative for my tastes, I
mean when they got anti-Nixon
and supported Agnew for Presi
dent..." So, Dan withdrew from
the YAF and joined the Young

Republicans. This is his second
year as President.

Benezet Knew III Housing traction, Coming say

“We are going to have to be much more‘

by Glenn von Nostitz

Albany Mayor Erastus Corning
revealed Friday morning that
SUNYA President Louis T.
Benezet knew as early as last
Spring that the city would be
cracking down on students
renting apartments in violation
of city residence codes.

According to Corning, Benezet
assured him that “there is ample
space on campus.‘ for students
to live, and that “He would not
in any way countenance or en-
courage thc city to violate the
law,"

Corning hinted that there
would be little administrative
interference in city enforcement
of the zoning laws, and that the
Albany State administration
would iiol stand in the way of
possiblc student evictions. The
mining, ordinance stipulates that
unrclalcd people cannot live in
lhc Silml' dwelling.
liul Bonezcl said yesterday
that the Coming statements
"pa/JII- me." The SUNYA Presi-
dciit claims that he remembers
hearing no such statements last
Spring concerning the Univer-
sity's role in the housing issue,
saying that, “The mayor and I
talk about many things and with
all due respect to the Mayor, I
think he escalated the impor»
lance ol the conversation."
Apparently, the Coming remarks
were made to Bencch verbally
and without any written letters
being exvliangI-d between the
two.

BI-nczcl went on to say that
llll‘ administration “does not tell
sludI-nls where to live." “It
would be untenable for this
administration to take .1in ac

tion that would twist students
arms and force them to live on
campus. We grew out of that
stage long ago," he added.

There has recently been some
speculation among affected stu-
dents that the administration
would like to see more students
living on campus, thereby
ﬁlling up vacant dorm space and
helping the state pay back con-
struction bond debts.

   
   

As a solution to the housing
problem, Benczet proposes the
construction of married stu-
dents' housing built near the
campus. He claims that he has
been trying to obtain such hous-
ing for years.

Enforcing the Law

The revelation came during a
meeting of SUNYA student
leaders with the Mayor in his
City Hall office early Friday.
The parlay was slatcd as a dis-
cussion of the recent studctn
housing crisis and as an oppor~
[unity to “open lines of com-
munication" between students
and the Mayor,

Barry Sloan made a iiiolioii to

Council last week endorsing

raised about the legality of a

the bill, felt that the Council

obvious farce of the original

tion" and that “we are going to
have to be much.more rigid on
it, since the problem is getting
worse." He reportedly told the
SUNYA President that “my
hand is forced to enforce the
law."

And “enforce the law is
exactly what the city proceeded
to do. Responding to complaints

Morris Avenue, the city notified

lating the law, and brought
many of them in for hearings.

In addition to telling Benezct
about the forthcoming crack-
down, Corning urged the Real
Estate Board and landlords not
to rent to students this fall.

During the last 30 days, the
Mayor's office has been receiving
“more and more complaints"
from different svcliiins of the
city, particularly from the
Manning Boulcvard Association.
Thcy city has notified landlords
of houses which have had com-
plaian made against them that
they may be violating the law.
At the present time complaints
concerning some 50 separate
dwellings have been filed, pos-
sibly affecting more than 200
students.

According to the Mayor, sever-
al landlords are now taking their
cases into court. If the court
decision goes against the land-
lord, he must notify his tenants
that they must move.

The Mayor emphasizes that
the tenant has a “perfect right"
to appear in court and state his
case. If the tenant can prove that

is confident that the city would
win a court battle, since we're
convinced that our zoning or-
dinance is legal.”

The Mayor pointed out that
“the demands have come on us

to enforce the law" and that

“this is what we're doing."

 

Moratorium Not Likely
Steven Gerber, Chairman of
Central Council Finance Com-
mittee asked Corning whether
the city will restrict itself to
acting only on complaints, or
“will they suck out violations
where there are not comv
plaints'.’" responded

tiona until the end of the aca-
demic year. Corning, apparently
caught in' the middle, reiterated
that there is “tremendous
pressure" on him to enforce the
law, and stated that “we'll do
our best to inconvenieice ten-
ants as little as possible."

The Mayor pointed out that
very few people have ever been
put out on the street and that
“If it's a question of time, and
people need to move, we will
give them the time that is
needed."

The danger that students may
actually be evicted this semester
seems slight. After eviction
notices are served, a tenant can
go to court and have his case
heard, a process that could take
several months.

Later in the meeting Corning
elaborated on the contents of his
talk with President Benezet:
“We made a very clear pitch to
Dr. Benezet and told him what
we were going to do. We in-
formed him that we were going
to have to act."

The major complaints received
at he Mayor's office are the
parking congestion caused by
several car owners living in the
same dwolling, the hours stu-
dents kccp, which Corning
claims “are different from home-
owners”, and complaints that
som children arc
