During the Spring ‘70 strike, a
new student awareness demand-
ed an opportunity to learn from
a “living” experience, to contri-
bute to the community and not
just take from it. Community
Service, a volunteer action
group, was formed to fulfill this
request. A 3-credit, S-U graded
case was started where students
contributed their time and ser-
vices to an Albany agency. Two
years later . . . how far has this
program come in answering the
student’ demands for relevancy
in the academic curricular?

“I grew up in a very protective
environment. I’m only now
ﬁnding out how impoverished it
was. Community Service...it's
like dropping in on the world
once a week."

Discovery plays a big part in
the Community Service pro-
gram. The students find them-
selves uncovering more of
society and of their own char-
acter in one semester than class-
room and textbook could do
during their entire four-year stay
at SUNYA. Albany politics are
not just words in a newspaper
article when the funds for the
‘get-the-kids-off‘thc-streets‘
recreation program you are
helping to organize are cut.

 

If the answer is yes, we think that we
can help you decide what to do. g-

If it’s stimulating discussion that you 0

dicated columnists as well as your

Maybe it’s ego-tripping, but you
can’t argue with the satisfaction
these students feel over a smile
they've brought to an old per-
son’s face or the knowledge to a
young person's mind.

Why do these students burden
themselves with this 3-credit
course? Any one of them will
tell you it’s a toughie. It means
six houri. a week (excluding
transportation time), evaluation
sessions and a 5-8 page paper.
Yet over 600 students pre-
register every semester.

When the program began in
Fall 1970, many students found
a worthwhile outlet for their
free time. As the program con-
tinued, however, many more
students discovered a sounding
ground for their fields of study.
Biology majors were quick to
apply for Albany Med and psych
majors flocked to Capitol Dis-
trict Psychiatric. Finally, stu-
dents could see their textbook
theories in action; they were
learning and contributing. This
trend towards career-oriented
voluntarism is still on the in—
crease and threatens to mono-
polize the program.

Mrs. Hedi McKinley. director
of Community Service which is
now under the auspices of the
School of Social Welfare, would

says the Community Service

Program seeks to instill a spirit
of true voluntararism in the
student. The career-oriented
volunteer. though he finds his
work worthwhile, can miss the
rewards of volunteering for the
sake of helping alone.

Whatever their reasons for
volunteering, many students
repeat the course for the maxi-
mum second time. In an attempt
to better understand the needs
of the second-time-around stu-
dent, Sue Seligson and Esther
Schuster, two students who have
already completed their year of
Community Service, are con-
ducting a study. At evaluation
sessions they talk to these stu'
dents about their reasons for
returning to the program.

“It's amazing! I spend alot
more time at my agency than six
hoursmYou learn to get out of
yourself, to more open with the
world. It’s a good feeling."

Most of these students have
learned the value of what Mrs.
McKinley would call “truc vol—
untarism," Their purpose now is
how to present their feelings to
others.

One attempt was a film en-
titled “What's Your Name"

Seventeen Norway maples are
