' ’iSlokem= SA R

by Ellyn Sternberger

Whether you choose to believe
it or not, Student Association is
the government for under-
graduates at SUNYA. Often, SA
may appear to be very imper-
sonal and bureaucratic. But this
year, Central Council, the legisla-
tive branch of student govern-
ment, is trying‘ to bring SA
closer to the students, and more
students closer to SA . Ken
Stokem, Chairman of Central
Council has deﬁnite views on
just how this is to be accom-
plished. '

Btokem feels that Central
Council is responsible to the
students in the budgeting of
Student Association money and
in acting as the “voice of the
students." About $600,000 is
collected in mandatory Student
Activity Assessment Fees (Stu-
dent Tax) each year, and accord-
ing to Stokem, “In budget-
ing...we hope to reflect the in-
terests of most all segments of
the taxpayers. We make a special
effort to fund to a greater extent
these activities which draw the
most student interest." He adds
that it is often very difficult to

determine priorities. Groups‘
often ask_for twice as much
money as SA has to appropriate
to them. The budgeting process
cuts down the requests, but Cen-
tral Council always has the ﬁnal
voice.

Stokem says that Central
Council also acts as a voice of
the students. The Council acts as
a lobbying and pressure group
for the students with regard to
the Administration and the Uni—
versity Senate. “Very frequently
we take stands on something in
the name of the students regard-
ing University policy. Central
Council takes it upon itself to
support things of a political
nature in the outside world,”
says Stokem. He noted in this

vein that during the past few
weeks, Central Council has en-
dorsed the Seven Point Peace
Plan of the National Liberation
Front, andzhas taken a stand on
the Presidential candidates. He
says that Central Council acts in
what it believes to be the best
interest of the students.

Stokem feels that the students
do not have a responsibility to

.39" , a?

espons‘ive

the Central Council, but to
themselves. “Central Council
will do a lot more of what they
[the students] want if they get
involved. This year Central
Council is making the greatest
effort ever to involve the stu-
dents. So far we’ve been success-
ful in involving over one hun-
dred new people in student
government since the beginning
of the year," and he is hopeful
that this number will double.
Stokem emphasises greater stu-
dent involvement as one of the
goals of this year‘s Central Coun-
cil, claiming that, “the more
people we have. the more we can
do., These people who are
becoming involved are going to
be surprised to find the amount
of influence they can have on
Central Council policies."

In addition to greater student
involvement, Stokem says that
one of the goals of Central
Council this year is communica-
tion: “Quad representatives are
making a more conscious effort
to communicate with their con-
stituents through newsletters
and informal meetings. The ob‘
ject is to get Central Council
closer to the students. Central
Council is not apart from the
students. We’re all students."

When asked if he felt there
were any obstacles or major
problems that Central Council
faced this year, Ken said there
were no serious obstacles. While
claiming that the problems be-
tween Central Council and the
Executive Branch have been
“overplayed” by the campus
media, he did admit that a pos-
sible obstacle existed in juris-
dictional problems between
them. “lt is my own personal
belief that Central Council as-
sumed less of a role last year
than they were constitutionally
intended to. Central Council this
year will encounter obstacles in
rcasserting themselves in their
proper role because the Execu-
tive Branch took up last year
where Central Council slackcd
off... Last year the President did
overshadow Central Council by
his personal knowledge of Stu
dent Association and his pet'-
sistcnci- in formulating Student

Association policy This war

that doesn't appear to be the

case. The Central Council rind
the Executch differ often on

matters of policy but it's only a

matter of coincidence rather

than organized action.

Stokcm goes on to explain that

Representatives from the Student Association of the
State University--SASU--will be meeting with student
government leaders from Albany State this week to discuss
the feasibility of the student government here joining the
statewide organization. On Thursday they will go before
the Central Council and prcss for a vote on the issue.

Wc hopc the (Iouncil takes a careful look at the proposal
and think seriously of joining. Many of Albany State's
sistcr schools, including the three othcr university centers,
arc dues-paying members. It scclns time for the Albany
Stiitc Sludcnl Association to scriously consider joining the
fold.

SASU has donc a lot in the past two years to bring rhc
SUNY scllimls closcr togcthcr through their student
govcrinncnis and to break down the political isolation
