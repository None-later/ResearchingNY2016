Year Of Sorvivlal On Nation’s Campuses

continued from page 3
The lack of broad student sup-
port for any action that could
lead to violence was vividly
demonstrated on the Berkeley
campus in mid-March when the
Students“ of a Democratic
Society SDS held a rally de-
manding dismissal of Prof.
Arthur Jensen for what they
called his racist views. Five
demonstrators were arrested.
Police action didn't cause a
ripple on the campus. The next
day SDS members were at the
plaza trying to pass out litera-
ture denouncing Jensen as a
racist. Most students politely re-
fused the mimeographed sheet.
Around the plaza, once a hive
of political activity, students
cluster around free-lance musi-
cians. Tables are set up at vari-
ous points but most are for vote
registration and one was passing
out literature on the Berkeley
sailing club.
What caused the dramatic
change in the student mood?
Students, faculty, administra-
tors and radical leaders have a
great variety of answers but
three basic ingredients are found
in almost every explanation: the
changes in the draft, fading in-

tensity of the Vietnam war and
the economy.

Some radicals are attempting
to maintain a very low profile.
Wendy and Mike, who declined
use of last names, were deeply
involved in the violent People’s
Park riots of a few years back.
Today, operating out of a
second floor apartment in an old
residence near the UC campus
they insisted in an interview that
“the same condition exists now
as existed at the time of the Free
Speech Movement and People’s
Park."

“This is the year of survival,"
said Mike, 34, who attends near-
by Grove Street College. “In
time of recession, a lot of radi-
cals are going back to school for
survival and to organize.”

He complained that the new
draft legislation “has co-opted a
lot of potential radicals. They’re
not worrying anymore.”

Wendy, a UC graduate student,
is wrapped up in women’t libera-
tion and predicted that there
will be “a resurgence of antiwar
activity because of the air war in
Vietnam."

But Adrian Kragen, professor
of law at UC's Bolt Hall, con-

cludes the “radical groups can’t
get support. These smart kids
realized they were not getting
any place with a violent ap-
proach." _

Kragen conceded that “One
soothing factor is that the ad-
ministration and faculty are a lot
more willing to sit down and
listen. We were not prone to
discuss. We didn’t talk. We told
‘em."

Larry Seidman, a graduate stu-
dent from Harvard and co-
president of the UC student
body last spring, sees students as
“critical of the war and Nixon.
They’ll vote for a change."

"But as to violence," ‘he said,
“there is a tremendous intoler-
ance... Confrontation tactics
have been discredited. It does
more harm than good."

An intangible factor in the
changing student mood, Seid—
man believes, is that "the
novelty of the student move-
ment has worn off. It's old hat.
Who can wear the longest hair,
have the shabbiest clothes, no
longer gives identification. Most
students arriving in college today
know the language, the issues
and the music. Dress is improv-

History professor Leon Lit-
wack, in assessing the student
mood, said, “They’re still very
restless.”

“After Cambodia,” he said,
"the students simply wore them-
selves out. There was disillusion-
ment with the radical move-
ment, the political process and
their own effectiveness."

After the calm set in, he said,
“students began looking else-
where for escape and expression.
Some turned to religion. Others
moved to communes. They were
frustrated in their inability to
make meaningful change.”

Cambodia also is viewed by
sociology professor Neil Smelser
as a turning point.

“Cambodia was a glorious
moment,” he said. “The idealist
felt something really revolution-
ary happened. It didn’t. Disil-
Iusionment followed. Politically
nothing could be done. After
Smelser sees the “student as less
radical, less likely to act on
political beliefs and less anti-
intellectual.”

As chairman of the Berkeley
academic senate’s policy commit-
tee, Smelser expressed the
opinion that the faculty has
“turned off from radical-
ism...and are now glad that
peace and quiet are back."

He said that most faculty “feel
picked out for excessive punish-
ment“ by state officials through
lack of pay increases and staff
reductions. He added that “mo-
tions are afoot to organize
teachers."

“The draft is no longer a
source of neurosis,” said English
professor Charles Muscadinc.
“Students are more cynical.
Hopelessncss could become in-
tolerable and they could cx-
plodc."

David Corvo of Seattle, Wash.,
it junior, said incoming freshmen
are “morc concerncd about their
careers" than causes and many
“are having to go into dcbl
earlier to get rm education."

Lack of activity might be illit’l’
butablc, hc said, to the fact
students “don‘t have as much
Icisurc time. Pcoplc hich to
Work to stay in school."

In officil il yciir, Chancellor
Albert II. Bowkcr vrcws the calm
as “partly cconomic and partly
political."

“'l‘hcrc is concern about piirl~
liinc Jobs," hc said in an inlcr~

view. “Cost of living is up: Fees
are increased. Before the draft
hung over students all through
college. The war was de»
escalated a lot faster than I
thought it would be. They got
the 18-year-old vote.”

Stanford fenced all last winter
with a different situation. Radi-
cal leadership is more visible and
vocal but was unable to mount
any campaign that attracts broad
student support.

Vice provost Robert Rosen-
zweig said, “I think we are over
the hump. This is not serious
revolution country. A lot who
thought it was found revolution
was serious business. When peo-
ple are threateneu they act to
protect themselves and get
tough."

Commenting on the temper
the faculty, Rosenzweig ob»
served that the “ {BCUItyis fa»
tigued. There is a growing sense
that violence is a threat to the
institution which they really be-
have in."

Frank Miller, editor of thr-
Dai'Iy last spring, said thcre was a
tremendous change in the cll»
mate from the spring to fall of
'70. Students found animosity al
home for what had happened.
Violence had turned more poor
ple off. They were amazed that
in the case of Kent State a lot of
people thought that studcn ts goi
what they deserved."

Stanford is phasing out RO'I'l'
activity and Miller, himself it
naval ROTC cadet, said that if
the issue had come up at this
time “I doubt in the prcseril
climate that it would be phiiscd
out."

Miller said he saw little chancc
of a revival of big student
demonstrations.

But Don Lee, revolutionary
senior student suspended for
three quarters for leading mill-
ins, insists that radical activin
on the Stanford campus has
been succussl‘ul.

Journalism Program Gaining M

by Don Butterworth

The ﬂedgling program of
“Seminar in Journalism” insti-
tuted at the beginning of this
current semester, may very well
be the precursor of an expanded
program in journalism. The suc-
cess of this program depends
primarily on student support
and the continued infusion of
state funds.

General student interest with-
ing the SUNY system generated
enough enthusiasm to cause
Chancellor Boyer earlier this
year to investigate the feasibility
of establishing a journalistic
curriculum within the State
University. A task force com-
posed of students and members
of the working press, instructors,
and administrative personnel-a
good cross-section of academic
life-~was appointed expressly to
determine the viability of such It
program. Ultimately, the com-
mittee concluded that the State
University of New York should
foster the beginning of such a
curriculum. As a result of the
task force report, Albany was
designated as one of three SUNY

units to offer this program:
Buffalo (whose four-year course
in journalism has only recently
been founded), and Morrisville,
who for several years has offered
a two—year program, were to be
the others. According to Peter
Idleman of the College of Gen-
eral Studies, Albany is an ideal
location for the student to learn
news-writing, in that the capital
area is a center of governmental
activity. This factor, plus the
reality of the newspapers in the
Albany area extending intern-
ships and the use of facilities to
journalism students, serves to
lend an aura of success to the
new seminar course in jour-
nalism.

The format of the present
course, while not entirely for-
malized, is, however, committed
into the hands of interested and
capable faculty of both the Eng-
lish and Business departments.
Among them is William Rowley,
former religious editor for the
Knickerbocker News for scvoral
years and winner of a national
award in recognition of oul~
standing religious journalism.

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 10, I972

The seminar at present con-
centrates on the news-writing
aspect of journalism, as opposed
to the management field, since
student interest lies in favor of
learning writing technique.
Withing the next few months,
the 15 presently enrolled stu-
dents, with the guidance of
Rowley, and his experienced as-
sistant Peter Hickey, will at-
tempt to establish internships
for students with Capital News-
papers.

While the students are ex-
pected to develop and complete
an independent study project
concerning a topic in the jour-
nalistic field, another feature of
the course is the weekly presen-
tation of guest lecturers. Among
those scheduled to appear are
Dr. H. Schulte, dean of the
school of public communication
at Syracuse University, and ex”
rcporter for UPI in Spain, and
Jack Newfield of the “Village
Voice."

Although attendance at these
lectures is mandatory for the
students of the course, the gen-
eral public is also invited. Ac-

 

  

cording to Idleman, field trips to
radio station WRGB and the
Capital Newspaper offices are
also being proposed.

However, it must be men-
tioned that at present there is no

 

 

“Albany is

an ideal location."

 

 

journalism major at Albany
State, nor a second field; indeed,
there is presently not even a
developed program but simply
the germ of an idea being tentav
tively explored. Of this fact,
Idleman was emphatic, while
being optimistic of the future of
the seminar.

Depending on student support,
there may be a larger program
institutcd in the future. He ex-

iimeiitum- = *

ore-ed the belief that a liberal

arts education is essential back-
ground fOr news writing, the
only way in which to be ap-
praised of important trends in
contemporary society. News-
papers, being cognizant of this,
have thus adjusted their hiring
practices. Idleman commented
that eventually money infused
into the program from the state,
combined with wider student
interest, could build a good cur-
riculum. The transition into a
good graduate journalism pro-
gram, such as that of Columbia
University, could then con-
ceivably be easily made.

All this, however, lies inde-
terminantly in the future.
Should the devotion of news-
papermen, instructors, admini-
strators, and students alike be
any indication, then the jour-
nalism program at Albany State
is insured. Not only may stu~
dents eventually be able to
channel their talents into a
worthwhile career goal by their
own efforts alone, but with the
help and hope of capital area
newspapers as well.

A Peek at Co-Ed Housing

by Arlcnc Kafkcr

As parl of the many innova-
tions occurring on this and many
other collch campuses through-
out the country, the State Uni-
versity of New York at Albany
has continued its policy of put-
ling rcsidenlstudents in a co-ed
housing situation.

There has been much confu-
sion as lo cxactly what co-
crluczilional housing consists of.

hall. This reduces actual co-ed
housing to those balls or por-
tions of residence halls where
men and women are housed in
adjacent rooms or suites, The
other above situations are often
referrcd to as "mixed" housing.

After having spoken to various
students, Suzanne Piercc, State
Quad Coordincator and Judith
Condo. Director of Eastman
Tower, [his reporter was left
with a very positive attitude
towards the success of this ex-
perimcnl. This year, there are

male-female friendships which
otherwise might not have oc‘
curred. There is an increasing
awareness of the problems and
thoughts of the opposite sex.
This type of college experience
is perhaps one of the best in
preparation for coping with the
rcal world, outside of the iso-
lated scholarly community.

One of the only problems
arises with students losing a
sense of caution that they might
olherwrsc have. They are so used
to 500ng both males and females
in llll‘ dorm that they don‘t
react In either a strange male or

some concern with campus
