New Paltz 15-50

by Ken Arduino

The Albany State cross-
country team had an easy time
of it when they destroyed New
Paltz on the Hawk's home
course, last Friday, by the score
of 15-50. That score is the
highest possible score in a dual
cross-country meet. The victory
gave Albany an 8-1 record this
year and a 9-1 lifetime record
versus New Paltz.

Albany State was missing two
of their best runners for this
meet. Coach Munsey gave both
Vinnie Roda and Nick DeMarco
permission to miss this meet.
Vinnie was running in New York
City, Saturday and Nick had
some school work to catch up
on.

Munsey was not worried about
the luck of these runners. In fact
he was happy to be able to give
some of his other runners ii
chance to win against this weak
New Paltz team. The strategy
worked as without Redu and
DeMarco, none of the runners
were quite sure who was going
to make a move and who would
win. Each runner felt he might
be the one to do it.

As the race began there was no
doubt which team was going to
win the meet. All of the Albany
runners were in a linelmding the
New Paltz runners. By the first
half mile the Albany runners had
formed a pack and had a sizeable
lead over the New Paltz runners
who were about ready to pack it

With the team title taken care
of, the feeling out process
among the Albany runners was
taking place. Jim Shrader, Bill
Sorel and Carlo Cherubino all
were at the top of the pack, with
Phil Doyle, John Koch. Scott
Abercrombie, and John Stanton
right behind. The New Paltz
team was already out of it as the
first mile was run in a fast 5.01.

The Wandering was over as Jim
Shrader made his move on the
second mile and started to open
a small lead. After he ﬁnished
two miles in the time of 10:17
he was told by Coach Munsey
that he was on pace to set the
New Paltz course record and
Shrader set sale for it.

Shrader finished first in the
time of 26:38.5 breaking the
course record by 14.5 seconds.
Carlo Cherubino finished
second, followed by Bill Sorul,
Scott Abcrcrombie, Phil Doyle
John Koch and John Stanton.
There was only 70 seconds
between the winner Shradi-r and
the fifth place Doyle.

Shradcr after the race said that
he knew he was close to the
record but was not sure if he
could get it. He also home that
another Albany runner could
have caught up and pushed him
to run even faster. Even though
no one got Clust‘ enough to push
him he comfortably broke the
record and his performance
earned him the Albany Runner
of the Meet award.

Not to take anything away
from Shradt'r's and the Danes
pcrl‘oriminces, the opposition
was Vi-ry weak. Racial troubles,
injuries and other problems have
all but destroyed the New l’altz
team. They had to hunt around
to get enough men to field a
team. It was an extremely poor
performance by them.

Albany's next meet is Wod
ncsdny afternoon at home versus
l’lattsburgh, The Danes will li'y
to keep their IIHJ record againsl

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1972

 

to know and love so well. One
simple question must be asked:
Who is the idiot who is respon-
sible for the playing of the nine
in such ridiculous conditions?

The game opened with an Al-
bany attack, and with two min-
utes gone by, George Keleshian
missed an open not 5 yarder.
After that, the game settled
down to a see—saw battle be‘
tween two rain-soaked teams.
With about 30 minutes gone by
a Cortland drive appeared to
have ended via a sliding save by
goalie John Thayer, only to have
the ball slide off his shirt, roll in
front of the goal, and be kicked
in. Five minutes later, the same
play occurred, with the same
result, and the score was 2-0.

New down 2-0, the Danes dc-
cided to pull their characteristic
come-from-bchind and fall short
drive which was climaxed by a
Cortland player being ejected
from the game, and a successful
penalty shot by Carlos Alvarez.
Thus, the half ended with the
score at 2-1, Cortland.

The second half opened with
an Albany drive that failed to
score, despite the taking out of
the Cortland goalie via ll sliding
tackle, and a subsequent cross in
front of an open net, but no one
was there to tip it in. No sooner
did Cortland take control, than a
goal was notched, making the
St'Urt‘ 3- l.

The Danes battled back, and
scored another goal a few min-
utes later. Albany then appeared
to tie the game on a shot that
was caught by the Cortland
goalie inside the net, hobbled
inside the net, dropped, and was
subsequently booted through
the net by Uzi llaimoff. How
ever the ofﬁcial nearest the play

 

did not blow hie whistle to signal

a goal despite the remoul ot‘

the hall from inside the not by
Cortland’s goalie.

Upon questioning after the
glue, the Cortland goalie readily
admitted that it was definitely a
goal. An excellent source re-
ported that the other ref had
exclaimed to our bench, "How
do you like that call," with a
look of amazement on his face.

The subsequent two goals
scored by Cortland came on
breakaways which probably
would not have occurred had the
score been tied, or if the Albany
defensemen had used sliding
tackles to take the men out of
the play.

It is fine to blame the refs for
part of the loss, but the Danes
did little to help themselvos. A
key offensive player seemed to
move in three speeds: slow,
slower, and slowest. Only one of
the three halfbacks was playing
enough offense, the other two
kept falling back to play de-
fense. There was a general lack
of hustli.I on the part of many
players, and an unusual lack of
aggressiveness on the part of
schral normally aggressive
players. Some of these problems
may have been due to the poor
condition of the field, but you
must remember that Cortland
played on the same field, and
scored five goals.

This Wednesday's game against
RPI will feature several position
changes, and will probably give a
good indication oflwhether or
not the Danes will have a re-
spcctable record this year. This
is the must game!
