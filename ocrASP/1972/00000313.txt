by Mike lgoe

Football coach Bob Ford had
his players ready to expect any-
thing in last Saturday night’s
game. As it turned out, though,
his men pulled a few surprises of
their own as Albany demolished
Niagara 43-0.

On the opening kickoff, Noel
Walker grabbed the ball and ran
it 94 yards for a touchdown.
However, an offsides penalty
nullified the play.

Marvin Perry later ran in to
score but this was also wiped out
by a penalty. The opposing
defenses then proceeded to hold
each other socreless for the
remainder of the first quarter.

Then, in the second period,
Carvin Payne scored Albany’s
first points of the game. Mark
Fuller’s extra point attempt was
blocked.

Just before the end of the half,

worry about preserving the half-
time lead was more than quelled
by the team’s 34 point outburst.

0n Niagara’s first possession of
the ball, cornerback Bill Hamil-
ton snatched a' Jim McLaughlin
pass and ran 26 yards for 3

Vince Pierce booted a 37 yard
field goal and the Danes took a
9-0 lead into the locker room.
Pierce's kick broke the school
record of 35 yards which he
held.

In the second half, the Danes
completely dominated play. Any

touchdown. In what seemed like
an instant replay, Hamilton
grabbed another pass less than
two minutes later and scored.

At the beginning of the fourth
quarter, it was John Johnson’s
turn for an interception.

Carvin Payne showed his ap-
preciation for the defensive
back's efforts by adding another
six points to the Albany cause
several plays later. Payne logged
a total of 104 yards in eight
carries for the night.

Late in the game Coach Ford
started liberally substituting and
the reserves responded in a big
way. Backup quarterback Gordy
Kupperstein and running back
Bob Gusberti contributed two
more touchdowns to the point
spread. In addition, the second
string defensive unit held
Niagara when the Purple Eagles
were threatening.

Albany’s total offense con-
sisted of 216 rushing yards and
21 in the air. The defense regis-
tered six interceptions, recover-
ing a fumble, and allowed only
53 yards altogether to Niagara.

On Saturday, the Gridders face
what might be their toughest
opponent this season when State
meets unbeaten Hudson Valley
at 2:00.

After losing to Oneonta Stati-
twice in the last four days, the
Dane's lfall Baseball squad will
be looking forward to the two-
game tilt at New Paltz on Oct.
lilth. The loss to ()neontn at
State's lfall Invitational was not
half as important as the defeat
handed to Albany when thi-
Darius visited the Dragon's den
in a league contest. 'l'ht- final
score was 5 0, and Kevin Quinn,
whom- rcttord dropped to il~‘.£,
was on the tiiilcnd of fotir costly
errors which gave Oncontii the
five runs, all uni-IIrnI-d.

It was Ont-ontn's first league
game and gave Albany thcir ini-
tial loss in the HUNY cont'erI-nttc
matched up with two victories.

Albany has two games left in
li'iigui- competition in the fall,
both versus an inexperienced
New I’nltr. club. A doubleheader
win at the lltiwk‘s nest could
present SUNYAC With a tight

"The"

by Barry Atlas

Imagine traveling back in time
to the year 1937 and observing
college life as it. was then, seeing
college men wearing tuxedos
with baggy pants, the coeds
adorned in ankle length lacy ball
gowns, dancing to tunes like
"Sunny Side of the Street” at
the prom.

It all happened last week in
Schenectady. The clock was
turned back 35 years at Union
College where_t.he filming of
Arthur Laurant’s "The Way We
Were" took place. The campus
appeared as it did in 1937—all
the ivied building with hundreds
of people walking around in the
dress of the period—and you
actually felt as though you were
transported through time.

When I first arrived at the
campus last Friday, I went to
the gym where they were in the
midst of filming the prom SCt‘nl‘,
There I saw 200 formally
dressed men and women doing
take after take, dancing the
lindy and jitterhug, till they got
it to perfection. Repeatedly they
would change the angle of tin-
camera, hoping to get a different
perspective on the scene. It
seemed like back-breaking work,
as these people were working
steadily from 7 am. to 7 pm.

They were finally preparer] for
Barbra Streisand’s entranci- to
the prom. Her part called for her
to break up the prom in her role
of Katie, a student fora Young
Communist radical. They reshot
her entrance about II dozen
times till it was just. right. Also

Movie at Union

caught in the camera's lens were
Robert Redford and Bradford
Dillman, the costars in the
mov1e.

It was fascinating watching
director Sidney Pollack (who did
“They ShooEt Horses, Don't

~ r (pour —

THESE NlGHTS...

 

 

They?") work with the stars and
help them realize their full po-
tential. It appeared like hard
work for the stars, roles needing
unlimited concentration and ef-
fort. But when the scene was
complete and success was at-

tnlned, all of thou_worklng on

the scene had an expression of
achievement on their faces.

After the day's filming was
over, I was waiting for my friend
Alan to change in the dressing
room, when my friend Leslie
and I were approached and
asked to be in the movie. We
decided to take advantage of this
once-in-a-iifetime experience. In
order to be in the movie I had to
cut my hair to a very short
length and was fitted with
clothes and hairdo of the time.

By the time they were through
with us, we were looking, talking
and living the year 1937. The
company went out to Pittsfield,
Massachusetts for the day and I
played one of the spectators
watching and cheering for
Robert Redford in a rowing
race. Fortunately, we put a lot
of effort into the cheering and
got the scene done in a few
takes. The time went by very
quickly and the work wasn't
difﬁcult. Not only were we all
fed well, transported back and
forth and paid for our services,
but we got the chance to partici-
pate in II most thrilling experi-
CHCO.

I learned many thing about
the ﬁlming of a movie. For
example the director uses his
cart to get the most out of
everyone cooperating in the ef-
fort. The camera crew and staff
have a great rapport with the
cast and were very patient with
us. This is a necessity for making
a successful movie.

,AlnD, I saw how hard the stars
work, seeing them put in over 12
hours a day for a week with few
breaks. A lot of hard, serious
work is involved in filmmaking,
especially when you consider
that well over 60 hours of film-
ing is used for a 20 minute
segment.

Basically, the story deals with
Barbra Streisand and Robert
Redford as they go from their
college days where he was a
B.M.O.C. and she, the campus
radical. It follows them at a
reunion 6 years after graduation,
their unsuccessful marriage and
subsequent divorce. The scenes
done at Union College, Pitts-
lield, and in Balston Spa will be
used as ﬂashbacks for the ﬁlm.
The movie is set to be released
next fall.

A.S.tl. Opens

by Andy Pallcy

It could have read like a romance story: “It was
opening night at the Albany Symphony. All the
wealthy patrons of this great metropolis were
there, as well as hundreds of young ladies in
flowered dresses and luxurious gowns..."

Alas! ()pciiing nights at the Albany Symphony are
getting better all the lime. biil they have a way to
go before they reach llIL' (lulth ()pening-(‘oncert-ai-

300.000 dollars. and a couple ol Conservatories

they work (I consider Albany a handicap to
almost anything), they do well. They make musu‘,
and they could do thlSL',

can play the lltheI .Sﬁvrnplimrv well, which they
did, it had glare and form, and made sense, as all
music should.

The Beethoven lz'ig/I/h Synlllflllllvl' posed greater
problems to the A50, and they had iioiiblc with
them. the piece, ohvniusly, musz sense as musu'
