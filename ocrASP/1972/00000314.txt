Botclorf & Rodney

by Russ Craig

This album should not be
overlooked. Upon hearing
their name one would think
that they were a comedy
team, but John Batdorf and
Mark Rodney make mighty
fine music. Both sing and
play electrified six-string a-
coustic guitars. John Bat-
dorf performs almost all of
the lead vocals and his voice
resembles Graham Nash’s.

Although they do, at

Council Sets Parking Strike 

Labeling the new university-
wide parking regulations “illegit-
imate“ and with Central Council
members asking "What alterna-
tives do we have?", Central
Council wrote and passed its
own parking policy last night
and called on the student body
to ignore the ofﬁcial university
policy.

It was almost certain that Stu-
dent Association President
Miehael Lampert would veto the
bill within 24 hours after its
passage. Lampert had argued
strenuously against the motion,

But Central Council Chairman
Ken Stokem set a special session
of Council Sunday night to
override the expected president-
ial veto and set the gears in
motion for a universitvaide
parking strike in six days.

The strike is set to begin
this coming Wednesday morning
at 7 :30 AM.

At that time students will be
asked to park in virtually any
legitimate campus parking space
on a first come first served
basis. This opens up faculty and
staff parking spots to student
vehicles.

The dramatic Council action
was the culmination of a series
ot events that began earlier this
SQIMIAEI’ when security officials,
wrthout consulting students,
drew up a strict new parking
policy that established priority
parking for faculty and staff and
cracked down harshly on vrolar
tors.

Emotional Debate

Aside from partially rewriting

the parking policy and calling

for a student parking strike, the
bill also enpowered Stokem to
establish an ad-hoe committee to
“co-ordinate enforcement of the
new (Council) parking policy"
and appropriated one hundred
dollars from Council's Emergen-
cy Spending Line to “educate
the university community about
this action."

The campus and community
media will be notified of the
impending strike.

“What we are doing, explain-
ed Council member Eric Lon~
schein “is setting up parking on
a first come - first serve basis in
legitimate campus parking spaces
on all gravel areas around the
podium and quadrangles. We
have no other choice. We are
being ignored. We have to do
something to make ourselves
heard."

The debate on the Council
floor became highly emotional
ill times as members moved to a
vote.

“We‘re tired of being pushed
around," Lorischein exclaimed
at one point. "I really feel Its
about time we got off our asses
and started asserting ourselves
on things we think are right."

He was one of the err-sponsors
of the bill.

“I‘m tired of this ailnrniis
[ration going around telling stu-
dents they are going to listen to
them and then not doing so,"

H

said Steve Gerber, another mem-

ber of the studcirt government

But there was strong object ion
from Lampert who argued that
the bill was unconstitutional be
cause only state trustees can set

parking regulations and because
the bill usurped Lampert's eon-
stitutional power by calling on
Stokem to implement various
ections of the bill.

Lampert also felt that Council
would lose credibility by adopt-
ing the bill and that the action
would also hinder future stud-
eiit-administratiVe relations.

Lampert tried to halt debate
on the measure and then at-
tempted to substitute a motion
that Council consider taking leg-
al action instead of rewriting the
policy. He lost on both counts.

Many of the Council members
argued that all other means short
of a strike had been tried un-
successfully and that a lawsuit
would prove too costly and
time-consuming. It was this view
that ultimately prevailed as
Council voted 16-1-2 to adopt
the bill and set a
strike.

Last Resort

The (‘ouncrl action is the liites‘l

->-Passage of a Council bill
suggesting specific changes in the
parking regulations.

All three of these actions have
had only minor effect. Student
government officials have

so far been successful only in re-
ducing the parking fines from
ﬁve to three dollars. The call for
first-come, first—served parking in
Dutch and State Quad, a lottery
system of parking in several
other lots, the paving of Indian
and Colonial lots, and the de-
mand that students be guaran-
teed meaningful eonsultation in
future decision making meetings
have all been largely ignored by
the administration.

It was clear that the sponsors
of last night‘s bill saw the call
for a strike as a measure of last
resort.

It was also apparent that Coun-
cil members were piqued at the
unequal slatus the regulations
bestow on students at the uni-
versily.

()nu Council member was more
succinct: “Why should a faculty
member who gets to campus at
noon have a reserved parking
spot close to the podium while a
commuter student who gels here
at 7.00 AM bare to park over a
quarter of a mile riwriy""she
asked.

The student complaints
against the landlords center
around high rents iiird poor ser-
vices. They charge that landlords
can usually get higher rents from
students than from a single
family because the studetils pool
together to pay the rent They

also complain that many of the
apartments are poorly, if ever,
maintained, and that most of the
"ieiiovations' have been made
as cheaply as possible.

regulations they were joined
briefly by Ray Glass, 3 past
student body prmident of SUNY
Binghamton.

Glass told the group of similar
administration-student differ-
enees on the Harpur campus and
outlined the role the student
government there played in
declaring “open university park-
ing." Glass said the measure was
so successful that “open parking
exists on the Binghamton cam-
pus now."

Student government leaders
here obviously hope for a similar
success.

“If students on this campus
don‘t do anything, I‘m going to
move that Council disbund itself
for the rest of the semester,"
oric Central Council member
said while the final version of
the bill was being drafted.

He was obviously joking. But
lhe Council is taking a political
risk in calling for the student
body to mobilize behind it come
next Wednesday. Not only will
the strike be the acid test ofjust
how effective students, working
together toward a common goal,
can be It will also be a test of
just how adequately'the legisla-

Students met with representatives of three Albany neighborhood
associations Wednesday night in an effort to "open lines of

coinriiunicatiorr" between them.

Itubrii decried “examples of no
enforcement of Aiming codes"
on the part of the city. He cited
several recently renovated s‘lrui'
tures in his neighborhood, which
he claims have no fr re escapes, ilh
examples of “lack of enforci-
mi-iri of codes "

Intermediary Needed

Later in the int-cling, (li'llll‘ill
(‘ouncil I’rnarrcr- ('omrnrttcr-
(‘linrrnirin Stevrin (Berber told the
neighborhood associations that
he would be willing to iiet as air
"intermediary" betwr-en them
and the students living off-
Culliputi. lie urged them to call
him whenever they have a coin'
pluiiit against ii house, and said
that he would contact the stu-
dents affected, asking them to

stop the disturbing activity.
According to (iivrber, if the stu-
dents IrVe m an li-l or li-Z area
illlll do not stop annoying neigh-
bors, "they Will be evicted."

All in all, the meeting seemed
to be successful in opening up
lilies of coiiiiirunicalron between
the students and the neighbor-
hood associritioiis. Students and
homeowners learned tlial they
agree on iii-Vera] iinportriiit
points, including the necessity to
do something about the landlord
problem. The neightborhood
groups agreed to use Gerber as
an intermediary, and they also
offered to cull Joseph Scaring,
off~ciimpus housing director
about “problem landlords" so
tlial he could better help stu-
dents in finding off-campus
housing.
