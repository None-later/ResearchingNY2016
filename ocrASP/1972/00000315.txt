Most undergraduates hardly
give a thought to the Alumni
Association until they do, in-
deed, graduate and become
full-fledged Alumni. The Alumni
Association of SUNYA is now
trying to start a trend that will
prove the importance of con-
tinuity betWeen the Student
Association, with which under-
graduates are mainly involved,
and the Alumni Association,
which is the vehicle that keeps
graduates in touch with SUNYA.
The Alumni Association, with a
long established history behind
it, is now starting to move ahead
with new innovations that prove
the importance of this conti-
nuity.

The Alumni Association has
many functions and activities
which enable it to create bene-
fits for both alumni and for the
university community. The

Association, by providing vari-
ous services for its alumni,
keeps them in touch with the
university community and
creates reciprocal relationships
which beneﬁts the university as
well as the alumni. Among the
various services, events and
special programs available to the
alumni are a travel program
which provides very commen-
dable accomodations and rates,
group insurance, group pur-
chasing, campus facilities in-
cluding use of Patroon Room,
Campus Center Library, Book-
store and some atheletic faci-
lities including use of Mohawk
and Dippikill campuses, place—
ment and activities. In addition,
there will be a number of ser-
vices for continuing education.
A few of the planned programs
are Summer Alumni Institutes,
regular graduate study and re—
fresher programs, alumni semi-

nars, reading lists ’snd scholarly
publications and papers. Publi-
cations such as The Carillon, a
quarterly newsletter which pro
vides information about alumni
and activities at the university,
directories and brochures furnish
excellent contact with the
23,000 alumni. In addition, the
Alumni Association maintains
contact through branch organ-
izations, fraternity and sorority
groups, awards and recognition
for successful and active alumni,
and an Alumni Association
Handbook.

There are various ways in
which the alumni provide sup-
port for the university. One very
important aspect is in regard to
funds. With the establishment of
the Alumni Association in 1849,
the alumni began its fund giving
by amassing the capital that
built and supported Sayles and
Pierce Halls, the ﬁrst resident
halls, in 1930. In 1964 the uni—
versity fully acknowledged the
importance of the Alumni As-
sociation by establishing an
Official Ofﬁce of Alumni Affairs
which is partly ﬁnanced by its
own funds and partly by state
funds. In order to provide the
$35,000 in scholarships that the
Alumni Association gives out
each year, Sayles and Pierce
Halls were sold to the state in
1965. Today, the alumni con-
tinue to support the university.
The class of 1972 established it
Scholarship Fund of $5,800 that
will provide one scholarship per
year. Some graduate scholarships
are also given. The most recent
major fund effort for the uni‘
vcrsity rriiscd enough money to
purchase the carillon bells which

are housed in the central tower
of the campus.

The alumni have demonstrated
support for the university 'in
other ways besides the financial
aspect. Some examples of this
are political support. involve-
ment in university governance
and policy making, help with
placement and distinguished
alumni as speakers and guests.

There has been a tradition of
strong leadership in the Associa-
tion. Many individuals have
worked conscientiously and
effectively to create an organi-
zation beneficial to the univer-
sity as well as the alumni. In
1964, the official Office of
Alumni Affairs was established.
The office has four full-time
staff members. part-time gradu—
ate assistants and varying num-
bers of work/study st'idents.
The two professional staff
members are David Jenks ’64,
Executive Secretary of the
Alumni Association and his as-
sistunt Elaine Drooz Friedman
‘45. Mr. Jenks is also Director of
Alumni Affairs for the Univer-
sity. There is also a Board of
Directors consisting of 14
members and an Alumni Council
which is a body of class and

branch representatives which
meets twice a year.
Today, close association

between the Student Association
and the Alumni Association is
being realized. In his Alumni
Diiy report, Student Association
President, Michael Lampert '73,
visualized the idea of a "con-
tinuous community" between
alumni and undergraduates as
the individual moves from

  AA Fuses Allimni-Irlnderrilmd'3"““'“'“y

undergraduate to graduate. The
Alumni Association maintains
this association by becoming
directly involved in university
life through sponsorship of
several activities. The Student
Photo Contest is due to be
started next month. Plans are
now underway for Community-
University Day which will re-
involw alumni with the univer-
sity. The Association was also
responsible for providing the
magazine, Nutshell, which all
new incoming students received,
The Student Association has
respectively demonstrated its
interest in the Alumni Associa—
tion by voting to loan the
alumni the $5,000 needed to
begin the annual giving program
and to offer interested alumni
the opportunity to purchase the
student tax card. In addition,
three undergraduates, Michael
Lampert, Eric Joss, and Tom
Clingan, are directly involved in
the Alumni’s Annual Giving,
Program Student Association
Vice-President, Eric Joss, states,
"the three students who have
become involved in the Alumni
Association, by speaking to
various alumni groups, are
helping in an effort to gr-l
alumni rcinvolved in thc univcr
sity.”

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

FRIDAY. OCTOBER 1'5, 197?.

by Jay Flavin

A new~year . . . a new semester
. . . new faces'. . . the same old
problems.

Belieing a mood of congeni-
ality at the first monthly
meeting of the Faculty-Student
Association's Board of Directors
was an evident muffled anger
and distrust over 21 years of
FSA Director-Management dis-
play of “benign neglect.” This,
the second year of more than
just token student power on
FSA's ten member Board of
Directors allows the 4 student
directors and the ﬁrst ever stu-
dent secretary, Tom Clingan, to
flex their vocal muscles in anger
and disgust over “continuing
FSA managerial inefficiency."

The Board meeting ran
smoothly until E. Norbert
Zahm, FSA‘s executive director,
broached the problem of con-
tinuing losses in the SUNYA
Bookstore (see graph), Honor-
able mention went to Faculty
Housing, and the Patroon Room.

Routine Board business con-
cerned the “liquidation” of the
Mohawk Campus horses. Noting
that accurate records have never
been kept until this year on the
diverse operations lit Mohawk
Crimpqu (funded by FSA for
between $60,000-3100,000
annually). Gary Jones estimates
that horse back riding at
Mohawk loses approximately
$7,000 a year. The entire stable
of 9 horses and equipment are to
be sold. True to FSA's style of
operations, the horses at
Mohawk urc ridden Western
style and our Physical Education
Department and riding club
teach and ride Eastern style. No
firm estimate of Value could be
placed on the stable though at
least three parties are intcrcstcd
in the acquisition.

The Mohiiwk Campus stuff are

also sccking pcrmi on from the

Board of Directors to obtain a
Club Liquor License. Because of
a~ lack of precise information
regarding consumption of .Bring
Your Own and On Premises
booze, this motion was tabled.

FSA management received
approval to sublet office space in
Executive Park Tower to Cri-
minal Justice Incorporated
(members of SUNYA’s Criminal
iJustice Department incorporated
to conduct research independent
of the University). Justice In-
corporated will pay $300 per
month for 2,500 square feet.
The 2,500 square feet costs FSA
(the student body)
$12,000-$13,000 annually. FSA
is supposed to receive office
space "gratis" from N.Y. State.
However, the state has seen fit
not to provide space for FSA
management, therefore, FSA is
leased to Executive Park Tower
3rd floor for 3 more years. Lease
costs FSA $33,000 per year.
“FSA does not need half the
space it pays for," claims
Norbert Zahm.

“We can not debate the wis-
dom of FSA’s lease in the ﬁrst
place," said John Hartley,
SUNYA Vice-President. The
lease was signed 3 years ago,
“and we must abide by it. The
$3,600 income from Criminal
Justice Incorporated is better
than no income,” summizcd
Hartley. Hopefully included in
the sub-lease is costs incurred by
FSA to move electrical outlets
and wiring of Xerox copiers and
Burroughs computers; approxi-
mate moving costs may run
$1,000.

Zahni now braver explained
FSA losses. Zuhm predicts no
loss in the Faculty Housing
Operation this year. Further,

abound. "Unless Patroon Room

.busineu increases, this will be

the last semester of Waning
Dinners in the Patroon Room,"

-declared Zahm.

Lampert and FSA secretary
Torn Clingan were not amused.
Zahm noted that “things were
looking better" but admitted

that the Bookstore was still in 10

trouble. Sales were off $55,000
this year. Lampert pointed out
that he personally had gone “on
the line" to students assuring
them that long booklines were
no more and that the new
management was making
changes to correct FSA’s ﬁnan-
cial picture and imbalance of
quad proﬁts paying for other
FSA operations.

Zahm assured the Board that,
despite faculty complaints of
arbitrary book editing, 92% of
all textbooks were received in
time for bookrush.

Lampert and Clingan voiced
heavily their disgust of the
“abissimal failure of the over-
night delivery systcm." Lampert
labeled the collapse as “mana-
gerial responsiblity" and claimed
to know of 4 managerial errors
loading to the ODS collapse, but
would not elaborate.

SUNYA President Bcnczet
urged the Board to go on to
other business and the touchy
problem of Bookstore in efﬁ-
ciency was tabled, momentarily.

Benezct then appointed a new
committee to review the FSA
annual audit, simplify it, and
report back to the Board. Also, a
committee wns appointed to
look into possible uses of
Waverly Place, an FSA housc
rented out for over 6 yours at
$150 monthly, FSA paying
taxes and most utilities. Both
committees have "heavy" stu-
dent representation and it would
appczir that this is the your FSA
will be “under the gun.”

The present policy is a team of

The piitrol is more “service”
