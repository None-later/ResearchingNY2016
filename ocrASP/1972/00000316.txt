An Open Letter to Benezet

 

    

Only Union Lettuce is UFW's

Dear President Benezel:
I understand that the Facul-

ty-Student Association of

SUNYA recently joined the
national boycott of non-union
iceberg lettuce. As a co-ordin-
ator of the Albany Area Lettuce
Boycott i would like to con-
gratulate you on being the first
local institution to support the
lettuce ivorkers in Arizona and
California in their struggle for
better living antl working con-
ditions.

There is one point I would like
to clarify for you in reference to
the Aaltm memo of September
22, 1972. Lettuce marked with
the Toamster symbol is not
union lettuce. The Teamster
symbol is used to by the growers
to avoid signing contracts with
their workcis who want to be
represented by the United Farm—
workers Union (UFW). It is very
important to purchase only ice-
berg lettuce bearing the United
Farmworkeis' black eagle label.

The struggle is between the
l'arniworkeis and the growr-rs,
not between two unions. In June
1970 the UFW petitioned the
lettuce growers for secret ballot
union representation elections.
The growers ignored the request.

and signed back-door ‘sweet-
heart‘ contracts with the Team-
sters Union. As a result 7,000
lettuce workers went on strike—
almost all the lettuce workers in
the Salinas Valley—to prove they
wanted UFW representation. In
March 1971 the UFW and the
Teamsters signed an agreement
in which the Teamsters recog-
nized UFW jurisdiction to re-
present I'ai'mworkers. But the
lettuce growers have refused to
acknowledge this agreement anti
are today claiming they have
'l‘eamstcr contracts and that
their workers belong to the
’l‘eamsters. This is not true. It is
a ruse of the growers to mislead
the public, foil the boycott, and
avoid signing genuine union con-
tracts with their workers.

The following companies have
UFW contracts and sell UFW
union label lettuce: D’Arrigo
Brothers of California, Mel
Finerman Co., Freshpict Woods,
lnc., lntcrharvest lnc., Lucas &
Sons, Pandol Kt Sons. l believe
they all have New York City
outlets and some of them sell to
Menands distributors. If I can he
of any assistance please contact
me at «1896022.

Sincerely,
{\lllfil 'I‘ltuycr, SUN YA '7]

Nyquist Holds State, Funded
‘ Colleges Accountable

by Robert M. Shaw
Associated Press Writer

As the state looks for ways to
help private colleges and univer-
sities with their financial prob
lems, some tough questions are
going to demand answers.

State officials will have to de-
cide how deeply, if at all, they
should get involved in deciding
how the money they provide
should be spent.

Educators will have to decide
how much control the state
should have ovor their affairs.

The institutions will have to
decide how deeply into their
financial business the state and
the taxpayer should be able to
look.

And state officials also must
decide how to balance the pub-
lic's right to know and the pri-
vate college's right to privacy,

All these questions fall under
the general heading of accounta-
bility. And you can hardly men-
tion that in educational circles
without provoking an argument.

State Education Commissioner
Ewald Nyquist recognized this a

couple of weeks ago when he
was speaking to a meeting of the
Commission on Independent
Colleges and Universities.

“Accountability is never a pop-
ular subject," the commissioner
said, “and I am well aware that
your degree of enthusiasm for
these types of accountability
may well range from apathy to
outright repugnance."

The types of accountability he
mentioned range from control
over all spending policies and
patterns to setting minimum
standards of quality that must
be met for aid to continue.

But Nyquist said there can be
no compromise on how far ac-
countability should go.

"I am convinced that any in-
crease in public funds must be
accompanied by full disclosure
of financial information," he
said. But he advocates doing this
“in ways that limit public in-
volvumcnt in institutional pro-
grams."
Such methods, the commis—
sioner said, would include ex-
pansion of the scholar-incentive

program and the voucher system
where the aid is actually given
first to the student who uses it
at any institution he chooses;

Nyquist acknowledged some
arguments against full accounta-
bility by private institutions—
and in public education as well.

Som: believe that making
colleges divulge all their financial
doings will lead to hurried com-
parisons of expenditures which
could lead to hasty conclusions
about quality.

In other words, some op-
ponents of full accountability
say that pressure from full dis-
closure might force them to pay
more attention to low-cost pro-
grams at the expense of higher-
quality programs that cost more.

Nyquist challenged the educa-
tors to help ﬁnd the answer by
helping to find "the levels of
accountability that you believe
are appropriate and adequate to
satisfy the public and that public

funds follow public interests and
that tax funds made available to
private institutions are used con-
structively and effectively."
