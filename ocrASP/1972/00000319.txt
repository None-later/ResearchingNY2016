THE BEST TO YOU
EACH MORNING

MON— FRI

"Love Means
You Never Have to Say!"

by Rick Mitz

Future Shock, the sociologists
tell us. Future Shock? Never.
We're suffering from Schlock
Shock. And it all revolves
around one word: Love.

What used to be so personal,
private and intimate has turned
into a merchandising formula for
wealthy would-be poets and ca-
pitalistic couldn’t-be writers who
never have to say they’re sorry.

Mass-produced love, like hula
hoops and Barbie Dolls, is a new
vogue. “Love is universal and
love is an easy thing to merchan-
dise," says the merchandising
director of Paramount records.
And not only are there bountiful
banal books and multitudinous
maudlin movies about the sub-
ject, but we're buying those
books and seeing those movies.
We're not being taken by it.
We're taking it in.

We’re allowing today's million-
aire mod prophets to perpetuate
old romantic myths that dictate
the meaning and greening and,
worse yet, how we can find
Love.

In order to find The Meaning
of Love, you have to play hoc-
key at Yale, break away from
your rich father and find a poor
girlfriend who has leukemia.

You'll find it if you get rirl of
your bad breath. Or the frizzies.
Or psoriasis. Or your mild case
of terminal acne.

You'll find it if you buy the
world a Coke,

You'll find it if you live alone-
alone-alone with a cat named
Sloopy.

Cardboard Love is enveloping
-- rather than developing -- us. In
poetry, in movies, on television,
in alleged literature.

"i used to be in love with my
teddy bear, but i love you lots
more..." praclaims a book called
“i love you” that's guaranteed to
be so impersonal you can give it
to anyone -- your lover, your
mother or your teddy bear. One
dollar please.

Or Peter McWilliams who has
written a slew of sappy books
(“Come Love with me & be my
Life," "I love therefore I Am,"
not to mention “The Hard
Stuff: Love") His books contain
such hard stuff as:
first

I lived for love.
then

I lived in love.
then

I lived love.
now, with you

I just

love!

’I‘wo dollars please.

But their books read like WalA
green greeting cards compared to
the works of the fathers of them
all: Erich Segal and Rod Mc-
Kuen.

Love Story: about a mule stu-
dent who plays hockey instead
of hookey. About a coed who
gets married and then buried.
$5.95 in hardvhack, 950 in
paper-brick please.

Anti Maestro McKuen: “If
they could overlook my acne]
and the inch I lacked/ to carry
them to heaven,/ I too could
deal in charity." $1.50 please.

“Rod puts into words all the
things I feel," said one girl I
know who doesn’t even haVe
acne. She considers McKuen's
prose-poetry to be good litera-
ture because it puts her feelings
into words. But good literature
takes words and transforms
them into feelings.

McKuen and Segal deal in
greeting card kitsch, but on a
different level than the others.
They manipulate us into wanting
to believe that love is easy. Their
works are read quickly, cried or
sighed over quickly. They lead
us into a fantasy world, where
life is a love story, where lone-
liness is a national pastime, ex-
ceeded only by leukemia and
acne. And they laugh all the way
through the bunk and to the
bank.

Love Story has sold more than
five million copies and was made
into a successful (financially,
anyway) movie. McKuen's books
and records have earned The
Bard more than $5 million a
year, Not bad for a little love.

And what does it all mean“? It
means that We're desperate
enough to find out the meaning
of love that we'll go through
one-night stands with McKuen
and Segal, who have become Dr.
Reuliens in romantic drag. every-
thing you/ always wanted/ to
know...

So what does it all mean? The
answer is probably best put in
one of McKuen's own poi-ms:
“If you had listened hard
enough/ you might have heard/
what I meant to say: Nothing."

But whatever they meant to
say, they say it over and over
and over again.

Maybe lovr- means you never
hill/P to say.
