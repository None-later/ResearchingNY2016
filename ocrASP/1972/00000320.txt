American film, there are sparks
of ideas, never quite developed,
hinting of originality and intense
self-examination. WHO I
HARRY KELLERMAN, AND
WHY IS HE SAYING THOSE
TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT
ME? is, I think, just such a film.
It succeeds, however, where so
many other American films so
disappointingly fail—it manages
to be complete, it tends to leave
one satisﬁed, because there is
decisive, logical action that
Georgie takes.

Few know what it's like to be
on top, and Georgie Solloway is
one of the few. He lives in a
plush black and white penthouse
palace atop the General Motors
building in New York, has his
own record company', his songs
have all hit the top ten: "Finger
on the pulse, eye on the spar-
row, everybody loviii' Soloway-
style." His most prized posses
sion is ole aXc, his guitarrand
perhaps that copy of Time Maga-
zine with his picture on the
cover, which proves to himself
hc's real. Another prim-d pos. 's-
sion is Sol M0505, his shrink.
You see, Georgie is convinced
hi-‘s crazy:

"My marbles, Doc, they are
spilling. They are rolling out
onto lht‘ floor and behind the
refrigerator, where you can't get
at them aiiymori-...l Ht‘t‘ a lot, of
shows that aren't listed I mean
they are not in the TV Guide,
Sol...Thcri.-'s this fellow waan to
kill me, Sol. A fellow that I
don't know who it is I mean
you're not a paranoid if l‘Vl'ry‘
body really fltit's hate you, right‘.’
An outside force, a big gun from
out of town is si'rcwmg it up. 

Someone iiaini-d llarry Kcllcr-
man is calling up every girl he
knows, and attributing to him
several social diseases, several
marriages, illicit affairs, every-
thing and anything to hailinouih
him in the eyes of the friends he
does have.

Georgii- is (ii-generating
throughout the film, as wr-
watch. Perhaps the more l'rigli
ti‘ning thing about the film, and
the more brilliant thing is that
he is degenerating as We are
insidc his mind The walls of
subjective and Ulllt‘t‘llvt' l'ilin
have dropped lllt'll‘ bonds, and,
without warning, we are illtl‘f'
nater shown Georgw and his
madness is treated as another
level of reality. We never know
ahead of time when we'll be
launched into one of his llilllllt‘l'
nations When we are, il is all the
more friglicning because we
can't see the l)l)]('('llVi' ri-ality
behind it, just as Gi-iirgii- can‘t
When Georgi!I ti-lls Dr Most-s his
problem, there is a pause, then
the kind Doctor breaks into a
chorus of “Don't Tell Me Your
'l‘roublcs," assuming ltay
Charles" voice, and tIL‘l'I'llllllﬂ
from nowhere the Ray (.‘harli-s'
band and Singers to back him
up. Then, Just as iinnicdiali-ly,
things are back to normal. Wt'

 

have seen it, Georgie has seen it,
but, hopefully, it has not really
happened.

Photography, says Andre
Bazin, is such an objective art
form. You can manipulate your
environment, pose a picture if
you wish, but the camera will
still record objectively what
you've placed before it. This is
why the beginnings of interpre-
tive art occurred as Matthew
Brady was snapping his first
plates—the realistic approach
would be more than covered by
the new art form, the canvas
painters had better find some-
thing clsc. This sounds like a
digression, but the point it
makes is that cinema is poten-
tially such a strong medium. Our
minds takc photography for
factiand are all the more in-
secure when unrcality plays off
of objective photography.

Georgie's madness, most of the
time, takes him back in time, to
examine differenct episodes of
his life—Ruthie 'I‘rcsh, his first
love, Gloria, his wife, Allison
Dinsmorc, the singer :it the audi-
tion. And she has a very special
me" for Georgie about time,
for time is Georgic‘s problem.

“The time is out of joint" for
Georgie‘he sees things, the most
important things, in reverse,
after they have happened.
Georgie is constantly regretting
what is long over. HP has de-
stroyed any chance for a sane
lifi- himself. Who llarry Kelli-r-
man actually is doesn't matter,
bl'causu it is Georgie who has
destroyed anything he ever
loved, Georgie who has screwed
everything up because he
couldn‘t have the responsihility
to stop dreaming. The society
didn‘t demand he stop dreaming
(we'll get into that in a ino-
lllt‘llll). There was no Ill't’lf to
stop dreaming, And so dreaming
came naturally to Georgie, lle
dreamt his life away, lic's old
now, and he's still not sure he's
done anything wrong. He‘s not
sure whal he's done. liiki- King
Lear in tht‘ forest, he lrics des-
pi-ratclyh to examini- liinisi-ll',
only to find his powers of self
examination gone.

“King Lear, alone In the forest,
see he looks up at the sky, hi-
says. “Oh, God, lcl inc iiol be
mad "

“Help me, oh wizard," Georgie
asks Doctor Most-s, “I lie busted
on the yellow brick road "
Georgie l'l'fl‘rs to the Wizard ol
()1 over and over again. What
yellow brick road has filllt'tl
hiin‘.’ The road of success? What
kind of success"

Psychology and Psychiatry are
Ullillllt‘ to hiin Georgie, they
offer him a handful ofsand' and
there's enough slipping lhrougli
Georgie's fingers already When
his hallucinations help him
1'Xillllllll' his shallowni-ss as a
human being, his inabilin in
love anyone, (‘Vl‘ll liiiiisi-lf, lu-
M't‘h in himself Allison, llll‘ girl
from the audition Shi- too is
getting, old, older, she has iI

 

problem with time:

III feel like I just auditioned
for the part of human being, and
I didn’t get the job...all the time,
I think, I’m auditioning I get up
in the morning and the whole
city says, “Thank you very
much...that‘ll be enough for
now...l'm thirty four years old
today, and I’m not prepared. I‘m
prepared for twenty-two.,.l got
up this morning and I was all of
a sudden not young. Not old,
but all of a sudden not young."

Georgie sees in her, himself,
and decides that if he can love
anyone, it's Allison. He and his
Chauffeur Chomsky, go search-
ing in the night for Kellerman,
before he calls up Allison. l‘lc
ends up in the Lincoln Tunnel—-
“Hey, this tunnel has no end."
“It has no beginning either," Dr.
Moses (now a 'I‘unncl Cop)
warns him. He has lost his dirt-c-
tion—hc‘ll never get out again.

Georgie finally ends up talking

stating
wood?

to his father who runs a delicates-
sen/restaurant. Dad is plagued
by time too, modernization in
the place across the street, im-
pending death by hardened ar-
teries...

Dad has managed to do some
sandwich naming:

“I put your name on the
menu. Got all the greats in there,
sandwiches named after them,
the Jackie Gleason Special, the
Johnny Carson Salad, Sammy
Davis, Men Griffin, alla them]
got in there. And now you."

These sandwiches are named
after the ashes and (lust of the
American Dream—those who
have made it to the top, and are
probably as screwed-up as
Georgie. Othcr victims of the
American Dream. People like
Georgie are America; in the end,
Georgie hcconics this country,
great despite the fact that it's
falling apart at the seams, de-
ranged and out of kilter despite

the fact that it's outwardly on
top. The metaphor is complete,
and frightening. “I'm immortal,
Pop!" Georgie tells his father.
“Sure. Now go to sleep.” His
father answers. Georgie does.

The film is playing on campus
this weekend, in Lecture Center
7. It stars Dustin Hoffman as
Georgie, Jack Warden as Dr.
Moses, Barbara Harris as Allison,
David Burns as Georgie's father,
Rose Gregorio, Betty Walker,
Dom DeLuise, Gabe Dell, and
Shel Silverstein in a cameo. The
thing was written by Herb
Gardner, who wrote A
THOUSAND CLOWNS, and
directed by Ulu Grosbard. Music
is by Silverstein, performed by
Dr. Hook and the Medicine
Show, I suggest strongly, how-
ever, that you see the film on
Saturday night, for on Friday
night, in LC 25,1.F.G. is running
one of Alfred Hitchcock’s most
exciting films, STRANGERS ON
ATRAIN. v
