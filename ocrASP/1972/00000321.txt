Halsman in Albany

byes-a De Smtil

The Albany Institue of Art and .

History formally opened their
season last Friday with a speech
from the renowned portrait pho-
tographer, Philippe Halsman.
Born in Rum, raised in Ger-
many, married in France, and
presently living in the U.S., Mr.
Halsman has taken many photo-
graphs of such famous people as
John F. Kennedy, Richard
Nixon, Marilyn Monroe, and
Einstein, to mention only a few.
He has a creative skill, peculiar
in his style. of diverting his
subjects through conversation
and trying to psychologically af-
feel: them in attempts to capture
original poses. Mr. Halsman told
of how he achieved certain ex—
pressions through many amusing
anecdotes. One concerned
Bobby Fisher, who complained
about his extended sitting of 15
minutes. Bobby was wearing a
light suit and brought along a
darker one, not knowing which
one would be best to be photo-
graphed in. Halsman preferred
the dark jacket, and to compli-
cate matters, Fisher insisted on
also changing his socks and
pants, even though they would
not be seen.

To illustrate his unique style.
Mr. Hellman showed a few hun-
dred slides of his pictures. many

of which have previously deco-
rated the covers of popular
magazines, such as Life, Time
and Newsweek. Included in his
display was a picture of a
strongly persuaded Nixon in his
shirtsleeves, and a candid photo
graph of Einstein which cap—
tured the essence of this true
genius. Besides these, included
were character portrayals of his
subjects jumping. Mr. Halsmsn
feels that one can catch the true
character of an individual in his
jump. Caught in mid-air were
such people as Lucille Ball, the
Duke & Duchess of Windsor,
Simon & Schuster, and Rogers
and Hammerstein.

The presentation of Philippe
Halsman proved to be very excit-
ing and enjoyable, and brought
to the Albany area an interesting
preview of .the many things to
come.

Also included in the opening
show was a display of fabrics of
the state of N.Y., consisting of
handweaving and needlework
from the 18th century to pre-
sent. Made possible by a grant
from the NYS Council on the
Arts, in the display are repre—
sented fine examples of em-
broidery, carpets and fabric tex-
tiles, made throughout the ages
with great pride and craftsman-
ship.

Jacques Brel-R.P.I.

Think so? We hear a lot about
lakes dying. Entropy they call
it. When pollution reaches a
certain level, it can’t be
reversed. That's what bribes
do. Contribute to moral pollu-

the community of man. You
know what to do about it.
