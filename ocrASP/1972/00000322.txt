by Bill Heller

Saturday afternoon will mark
the start of the seventieth fall
classic between the mous-
tachioed Oakland Athletics and
the Big Red Machine from Cin-
cinatti. Looking at what should
be a highly dramatic confron-
tation, we'll see how the teams
match up in four key areas:
infield, outfield, pitching, and

bench strength.
Inﬁeld: Going around from
ﬁrst base to home, we get the
following matchups (Cin. A Oak i

1st base: Tony Pereze-Mike
Epstein; at. 2nd: Joe Morgan -
Dick Green (and others); short-
stop: Don Cheney - Bert Camp—
anaris‘, 3rd: Dennis Menke - Sal
Bando; and finally catcher:
Johnny Bench - Gene Tenace.

The biggest edge for the Reds
is at second and of course at the
backstop position. Joe Morgan
had a super year at the bat and
compliments it with his speed.
A's manager Dick Williams loves
to platoon his second baseman.
Chances are Green will start. but

Cullen, Ted Kubiak, and Dal
Maxvill. None are standout hit~
ters, although Maxvill flashes a
ﬁne glove in the field. Edge ‘
Cincinatti.

Johnny Bench is Johnny
Bench, probably the finest playv
er in the game today. Bench has
the arm, bat, glove, and speed all
over a promising but unproven

Just about evey footbiﬂl coach
will admit that a team has to
deal with one game at a time.

One might expect Albany foot-
ball coach Bob Ford, though,to
be particularly concerned about
the future since his team will
step up to varsity status next
season.

But Ford is always one of the
ﬁrst persons to attest to the
importance of getting ready for
one game in particular.

However, there is no doubt
that this weekend’s bout with
Hudson Valley is the game that
Coach Ford, his players, and his
staff have really been waiting
for.

Last spring Ford expressed a
strong desire to avenge last
season’s loss to the Vikings.
After a victory over Stony»
Brook, Ford noted that his team
couldn't afford to repeat the
mistakes of that game against
Hudson Valley,

cided ' A's vs.

self as a good hitter, good field-
er, and excellent baserunner.
Don Cheney hit well in the
playoffs, but lacks Campy's all
around ability. Edge - Oakland.

'I‘ony Perez and Mike Epstein
are an interesting matchup. Both
have the knack of hitting ‘em
out and knocking them in. Perez
may be the better fielder, but it
doesn't merit the nod over
“Super—Jew." Edge - Even.

At third, neither Sal Bando or
Dennis Menke have the great
stick. Menke is a trifle better
fielder, Bando slightly more dan-

Here Tomorrow

This week’s practices have also
shown evidences of a strong de-
sire to win. If determination
were the deciding factor in a
game, the Danes would easily
sew up a victory Saturday.

At any rate, tomorrow’s third
meeting of the two foes figures
to be ii hard fought contest.

Hudsoh Valley's defensive unit
has held the opposition to 353
total yards in four games in
addition to recovering four fum-
bles and picking off 15 passes.

The Great Danes, meanwhile,
have recorded two shutout; interv
cepted 13 passes, and recovered
eight fumbles.

Offensively, both clubs have
stuck mainly to the ground game
so far. In fact, the three Viking
quarterbacks have thrown more
interceptions than completed
passes.

The game really means a lot to
the team so I hope chryone will
try to attend. The support from
the Albany fans or the lack of it
for thatmatterjust might make a
difference.

RPI Cages Danes; Seven FonsAttend ‘

by Nathan Salant

Before Wednesday’s game with
R.P.I., several changes were
made to try to put some life into
the Danes‘ general game. Lnrry
Herzog, normally a fullback, was
moved up to the right inside
position to toughen up the of
fense. Karl Haeusing was pulled
back from the halfback slot to
fill Larry‘s place and Uzi
Haimoff was inserted in the
empty halfback spot. All three
turned in their best per-
formances of the year, but the
Danes were beaten by R.P.l. by
a score of 2-].

With those three turning in
such fine appearances, you may
ask, “How did we lose?" 'I‘hree
reasons: poor halfback play, no
play at all by our center inside,
and a slight hearing deficiency
which gave the game away,

The game was scoreless until
Herzog practically kicked the
goalie through the net, let alone

the ball, and with 10:00 minutes
to go in'the first half, Albany led
1-0. New Albany had a great
chance to put the game away.
but. a combination of bad breaks
and good saves kept the score
from changing, and the half
ended with Albany leading 1-0.
The 7 or so Albany fans—YES
COUNT THEM ON YOUR
FINGERS!!!!!** went wild, as
did the team.

The second half opened with
scvenil drives by both teams, all
coming to naught, until Don
Wemple put one away for the
R.P.l.-meii with 8:5] gone by.
The game seesawed back and
forth, but also got more and
more physical. Pushing and shov-
ing increased, but no calls were
made, An Albany breakaway
was stopped via ii hand ball, but
no call was made-apparently
the refs did not want the game
decided by a penalty shot.

With approximately ti minutes
left in the game, an l{.l’.l. player

As you probably know, I've

Well, this week, I'm going to
make excuses for the ref: he was

the ball was kicked, the whistle
blew, and a penalty kick was
called against Albany for no
reason at all. A player was sub-
sequently ejected from thegame
due to the official's inability to
distinguish between the letter
"f" and “s”, and his ability to
imagine himself being spoken to.

The resulting kick was almost
blocked, hit the far post, and
then. as if in protest of the call.
rolled along the line the length
of the goal. only to roll in at the
last moment. A storm of protest
began that continued after the
game. The claim was made that
the ejected player had used foul
language, and that the Albany
bench was guilty of the same
offense.
