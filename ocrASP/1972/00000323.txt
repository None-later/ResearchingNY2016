Th e Albany State cross-
country team, reaching the

tough part of their schedule,
gained some momentum as they
crushed Plattsburgh 16-47, Wed-
nesday at Albany. Albany is now
91, Plattsburgh is now 1-3.

Albany, which still has to com-
pete in the Merrimac Invitational
the S.U.N.Y.A.C. Champion-
ships, and the Albany Invita-
tional on successive Saturdays,
used this race as a practice of the
techniques they will have to use
in them. Coach Munsey set the
plan where a selected runner
would set the pace for a selected
distance and then turn it over to
a new runner who would do the
same. This enables the runners
to help each other out during
the race, a practice which is
necessary in meets with large
fields.

To help out with this plan and
to give them some work and
experience, Munsey added three

Harriers Romp Again

J.V. runners to the nine man
varsity squad. The plan worked
to perfection. The Albany first
mile was slow but the pace soon
picked up despite a gusty wind.
The Albany team had five run-
ners at the lead while Platts-
burgh had only one runner in a
challenging position. But he.had
to contend with too many men
to pose a threat to the lead.

At the three mile mark the
pacing had proven to be effec-
tive. Four Albany runners had a
good shot at finishing 27 min-
utes,_a feat no previous Albany
team had accomplished. Vinnie
Reds again led the way with a
26:34.8. Jim Shrader, spurred
by the presence of his brother,
was only a few yards behind but
comfortably in second. The bat-
tle between Bill Sorel and Nick
DeMarco for third was lost in
the excitement that all four were
going to break 27 minutes. Bill
caught Nick with about 90 yds.
to go, but Nick put on a last

minute sprint to beat out Bill by
two tenths of a second. Sorel
was timed in 26:45.6, the fourth
man under 27 minutes.

Carlo Cherubino, John Koch,
Phil Doyle, Scott Abercrombie,
and John Stanton ﬁnished sixth
through tenth. J.V. stalwarts
Richard Crana, Jim Genhardt,
and Jim Wilcox finished 12th,
13th, and 15th respectively.

Dispite the record time and the
battle for third, the most ap-
plause was for Ellen Turkel,
Plattsburgh's sixth runner. De-
spite finishing last, she was given
a well deserved hand for finish-
ing the course under tough wind
conditions.

This Saturday Albany travels
to the Merimack Invitational
which they won easily last year.
Little is known about their op-
ponents but Coach Munsey is
optimistic. He has a right to be,
because after today’s perform-
ance it jUst might take a super
team to bent Albany.

Fall Baseball

by Richard Mark Yaiiku

With the full baseball season
coming to iin end, a baseball
playcr hates to look toward win-
ter. Althouin mortI baseball will
follow with the start of spring
baseball, the winter prcscnls
muny worries. Thc “worries” arc
of it more physical and mental
type. The biillpliiycr mainly
worries about not swinging H but
for l‘ivv or six months, inability
to kccp in physical shiipc
through llic winter, and not scc-
ing a bull field until mid April.
The winters in Albany lust illlll

tlic first giimc of lhc spring is

“Do You Ball”

Kent, Ohio—A new umorals"
question has arisen at Kent State
University following an address
given to the freshman class by
KSU student body president,
Bob Gage.

Gage was scheduled to spciik at
an opening night gathering,
which started off freshman
week, and was attended by
freshmen, faculty, parents, Uni-
vcrsity administrators and the
president of the Board of 'l‘rus-
tees,

Gage announced at the podium
that instead of the usual "wcl~

come freshman speech" he was
going to talk about sex. This
triggered off some laughter and
murmcrings in the audience, but
Gage continued.

He launched into ii talk about
premarital scxr”Yuur father
tells you not to get caught, and
your mother tells you not to do
it. " '

Gage then told the crowd of ii
rcporl hc had seen documenting
tlic correlation bctwccn ii greiit
deal of Sl'xllzll activity and high
scholastic achievement, ridding,
l'l don‘t mean you how to go
out and lliIVl' scx to get A's."

Gage then concluded by say-
ing, “I want this to be u campus
where you can not only walk up
to your fellow student and say
‘hi.' but I want this to be a
campus where you can walk up
to another student and say ‘Do
you ball?”

Typical of the many reactions
to Gzigc’s speech was that of
parents who immediately de-
manded that their child be with-
drawn from KSU. “What he
(Gage) said fit cxactly with what
my neighbors wcre telling mc
about KSU rill summer. I
thought his speech was in ex-
trcmi-lv bad taste."

DEMONSTRATIONS
October I4

San Francisco, Ca.
(CPS)—"The war must be
ended,“ Richard Nixon told the
American people in August of
1963, “if the war is still going
on in January, it can best be
ended by a new administration
that has given no hostages to the
past."

Four years later, the war in
Vietnam is still going on. In San
Francisco the National Coalition
for October 14 is trying to revive
2i waning anti-war movement,
dissipated from four years of
energetic diffusion and countless
anti-war demonstrations which
drew no response from govern-
mental powers.

“We hope the demonstrations
on October 14 will not be a
continuation of the past," said
Joe Barthel, ii national coalition
worker, “but a resurgence of the
anti-war mOVement,"

Whether or not the demonstra-
tions will have it greater effect
than in the past is not known,
but indications are that the Oc-
tober 14 coalition will create the
largest (lemonstrations in the
piist several months.

Planning groups are established
in more than 20 major cities,
some of which have been plan-
ning tlic demonstration for as
long as six months.

The largest turnouts for the
demonstrations are expected in
New York and San Francisco.

The idcii for the mass (lemon-
stration originated in the San
Francisco area, where almost a
half :i million people marched
through the streets, in April
|!)7l, in ii mussch anti-war
dcmonstriition, only to arrive at
Goldcn (iiitc Park to hear
speeches from almost every
major movcnicnt group except
the anti-war people.

At that timc, the justification
of hiivmg so many different peo»
plc speaking was to get the
support of all tlic various groups.
The October H dcmonstration,
howcvvr, will focus on thc war
and thc Will’ iiloiic, according to
'I'crry (Iiirl, ii member of the
Octobcr l‘l national coalition
stccring coinmittcc.

“Wc‘vc bet-n able to gct to-
gether ii unitcd anti-war group,"

room and work on a project
together when they usually can’t
agree on anything."

One of the major problems the
Bay Area group had, she said,
was to get a list of speakers that
everybody agreed on. Presently,
ﬁve speakers are scheduled to
speak: David Dellinger, who is
involvr‘d with the recent release
of the POWs; Julian Bond, Geor-
gia state legislator; Ramsey
Clark, former attorney general; a
speaker from the Union of Viet-
namese; and a speaker from the
Bay Area coalition.

The coalition staff maintains
that the change of attitude in
the anti-war movement in recent
months can be attributed to the
Provisional Revolutionary Gov-

ernment’s Seven-Point Peace
Plan.
"The message behind the

demonstration," Bethe] said, “is
that there is a way to end the

war, but it‘s lying on the Paris
Peace table, and the Nixon ad-
ministration has imposed a
blackout on it."

The PRG seven-point peace
plan was presented in July,
1971, but has not been met with
approval by the Nixon admini-
stration. Nixon claims that such
a settlement would generate a
communist trike-over of Smith
Vietnam, although the plan calls
for elections and a coalition gov«
crnment, including all pro-
independent forces from the
NLF and members of the pre»
sent Saigon government.

Nixon has also said that Ameri-
can troops and POWs would be
endangered if the plan was ac-
cepted, cven though the seven-
point pcucc plan guarantees that
the I’OWs would be returned as
soon in; Amcriciin troops, wea-
pons and advisors are with-
drawn.

Proponents of thc seven<point
pciicc plan in this country say
the most important points in the
plan are the ones that call for
the US. to set a date for the
total and complete withdrawal
of its forces from Vietnam and
that the US, must end its inter-
Vciition in the internal affairs of
that country~spccificully it
must stop supporting the
Nguyen Viiii 'I‘hicu rcgime.

Mcmbers of thc October 1-1
national steering committee are
focusing on the publication of
the PRG peacc plnn during the
period before the November
election, according to Barthel,
because of the political sensi-
tivity of the nominees.

“We are aware that this is n
politically important period," a
representative of tlic People's
Press, no orgiiiiizution dealing
with information concerning the
()ctobcr I‘l coalition told CPS,
but this is the only period that
tlicrc is any hope to draw re-
spotisi' from tlu‘ government,
and get information to the peo-
plc."

Carl siiid theI impact the
dcinonstriition would have on
the November elections was
secondary in the minds of the
steering committee members.

“It doesn't mutter who is
elected in November," she said.
"The important thing is to keep
the uiiti'wur movement going.
If Nixon lb' elected, we're facing
four more yeiira of war, but we
can try to elicit some response."

"If McGovern is elected," she
concluded, “there has got to be
an active group to make him
keep to his word."
