The 'EverwatcthI,‘

Awesome Univac. . .

by David Lerner

Imagine, somewhere deep within the heart of State a Giant, buried
beneath shielding concrete and cobblestones, hidden from view in an
obscure section of the Academic Podium, protected by heavy metal
doors that remain, almost arrogantly, closed to the curious. Listen,
and imagine the purr and hum of a great underground network of
intricate wires, cables, connections, relays, and circuits. Try to
visualize an immense hallway of seemingly limitless length, ascep-
tically lit with white light casting its even shadow everywhere.

What massive Colossus is this that resides here in our humble
village, hinting to no one of its existence, yet commanding such awe
and reverence that those who have ventured to breach its walls and
have returned alive can only but guess at the awesomeness that lives
inside? What could it be that so controls our academic existence yet
goes virtually undetected, totally unnoticed by the Vast majority of
the residents of the campus?

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

 

Ah, but fear not citizens, for ’tis a friendly, or at worst, non-caring
unfeeling creature of which we speak. For there has yet to be a
UNIVAC 1108 that cried. Though while Mr. Spock might become
subconsciously angered at being referred to as a “son of a computer,
a descendant from a whole line of computers,“ UNIVAC couldn't
care less at the intended slur, but would merely regard it as a
statement of fact. Somewhere to be sure, somewhere in its huge
memory of a few hundred million computer words, within its
FAS'I‘RAND ll's or its «132 drums or its six magnetic tape machines,
or maybe even within the great Core itself, UNlVAC IIOB knows
what it is and what its purpose is here on earth.

It awaits, always ready to be of service to any studan who knows
that when mortal man can no longer help solve a super human
dilemma. he can turn to UNIVAC for the needed guidance. Defender
of the right to know, UNlVAC is armed to the teeth with air
impressch aray of components. This vast arsenal, quickly mentioned
before, deserVi-s, no, DEMANDS a further explanation,

'l‘ht-rr- are four drums, three of the type 432 and one of the type
1782. Each, (though not able to leap tall buildings in a single bound)
has the Capacity of 262,000 words and 2,1 million words of memory
respectively. Complementing these workhorses are the two
FAS'l‘ltAND drums each containing 22 million words of memory,
For the uninformed, a drum is a mass storage device designed to
handle the millions of requests UNlVAC will be risked to execute
during its lifetime.

Studnt Parking Srike Enters Third Day;

by Ellyn Sternberger

The parking strike enters its
third day this morning with all
towing operations thus far at a

the action calling on the student
body for help in meeting man-
power shortages. Tire future of
the strike appeared somewhat
uncertain.
