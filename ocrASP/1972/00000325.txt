Some partvtime student book-
store employees had “adjust;
merits" made in their work
hours Monday morning.

Arnold Colon, who has been
bookstore manager since Spring
Semester, said that the reduction
in hours of some part-time stu-
dent personnel was the direct
result of decreasing sales for the
first quarter of fiscal 1972. Ac-
cording to Colon, “Sales are off
$57,000 from last year’s rate.
This $57,000 is close to
$200,000 Off of projected in-
come in FSA‘s budget." Der
creasing income has mandated
savings in payroll and other
operating expenses. “Most of the
students affected were hired
during bookrush. and were told
they were hired on a day to day
basis," Colon claims.

The Bookstore has been
heavily criticmed for the past
three years because of continu-
irig losses and poor textbook

lettuce Boycott Gains Momentum

by TS. Prince
Special to the ASP

Phoenix, Arizona — “Don't let
the bastards grind you down!"

it is nearly ten years now since
that sign made its first appear‘
ance in the physically shabby
headquarters of the United
Farmworkers, and although
there have been many bastards.
the UFW has not been worn

The union has survived against
every bit of influence wielded by
Ronal Reagcn and those who

worse policies of the Nixon ad

no other organization has done
In history organiZed agricultural
workers, gotten contracts, and

Organizing workers in agri~
culture is considerably more dif-
ficult than organizing in an ur‘
ban environment. The Ult‘W's
membership is not well educa-
ted nor is it located in a small
area which makes for easy com
munication. The conditions of
poverty characteristiciilly associ-
ated With migrant workers force
families to move around as often
as butterflies in heat. Tens of
thousands of illegal aliens are,

growers to break strikes. and

illegals will work for as little as
 70 per hour

tions is if they hurt the growers
into submission.

As a top union organizer Jim
Drake explains:

“The great thing about the
boycott is that there you are
dealing with profit which might
mean 3 per cent, 4 per cent or
even 1 per cent. in a strike it's
the same thing, but there you
havo to do it for a long time
during which you have to pay
people—they've got to have
food. In an election you have to
get 51 per cent, but in a boycott
you have to worry about only '1
per cent or 3 per cent of the
people not buying a product.
Thai is why a boycott is the
most effective non-violent tool
in the world to use. It's really
surprising that it's not used
more, and it‘s not surprising 'hat
it's the one thing the growers
want to take away from us."

As the UFW has become more
successful, growers have been
rcdouhling their efforts to take
the boycott tool away. When the
grape boycott began, growers
sent their darling Ronald Reagi-n
to tell the world that his good
looks and health are directly
attributable to eating grapes
From 1907 1909 agribusiness
corporations used their influence
to see that our boys in Vietnam
would have grapes [Front 1007
to I069 grape shipments to Viet
nam increased from 108,000
pounds to 2,](57,000 pounds)
1072 has seen attempts by Nix
on appoiiilec l’eter Nash of the
National Labor Relations Board
to make the Ult‘W boycott illegal
on a national level [it failedl,
and by the Farm Bureau to gel
intliitidual states to outlaw the
boycott lfurin Bureau bills have
passed in Arizona, ldaho, and
Kansas, and one is on the Nov
ember liallot in ('alifornia.

ll is almost amusing to listen
to stories of the union before its
boycott strategy was adopted
According to Jim Drake, “After
the grape strike started We Were
completely whipped. The strike
started in September lltlib, and
by l)eceiiilier there was no hope

Some of us finally convinced
Cesar that he ought to consider
the boycott. It was agreed, and I
was made coordinator of the
Shenley Liquor boycott.

“There was no space in the
tiny office they had, so we
remodeled the bathroom. Rich-
ard Chavez built a desk OVer the
toilet. I slept there. I lived in
that office."

At the time there were not.
many experts who expected the
union to be around long. Drake
points out what saved la causal
“Well, none of us knew what. we
were doing which was a real
advantage The laborers thought
We were era/.y. Eventually they
saw it was as effective a weapon

The growers ignored these re

licily, but the Democratic Con-

boost it needed as delegate after

the strike over natioii~wide tele-
vision.

'l'oday, it is general knowledge
that a lettuce boycott is occur-
ring biit the issue is complex
enough to be misunderstood by
many.

l‘arinuorkcrs Plight

Farm workers may be the
poorest, most powerless people
iii America. They earn under
$50 per family per week taiid
that figure includes all members
of the family husband, wife and
children working). A child
often starts working at the age
ot twelve The labor itself is
sli‘viititillh and back-breaking, re
quiring continuous bending aiiil
picking.

Since the system of payinenl is
piecemeal, the worker is driven
to work harder and harder.
Usually, he finds he is unable to
pick by the age of thirty and is
left witlioul a marketable skill or
education, by then. he may have
a child of ill least eleven or
twelve who can work to keep
the family alive. And the exploi~
tive system begins iiuew.

responsible for the exploitation
of the farmwroker are not mid-
dle class; they have been ill)'
