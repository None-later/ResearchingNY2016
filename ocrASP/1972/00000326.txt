IN THE NA

by Robert Mayer

Each day the mail that arrives
at the Albany Student Press is
dumped on the various editors
desk. Much of it finds itself in
the garbage only minutes after
delivery. Occasionally a letter of
importance is seriously read and
then the editor is left with three
choices. He (01' Shel 03" throw it
away, can file it (often :is effec-
tive as throwing it away), or Clln
follow it up with the intention
of doing an article on it.

Several weeks ago I read a
letter that was addressed to our
office mailed from the “Citizens
Committee for Justice for Farah
Workers." That was the first
time l heard of the group and I
am sure for many of you this is
your first knowledge of theI
group. 1 was interested to learn
more of the Farah workers and
soon discovored another tragic
episode in the history of Ameri~
can labor.

The lndiislrial Scene

Familiarity with the plight of
the Mexican American has cen-
tered in recent years around
Ceasar Clievcz and the grape and
lettuce boycott. Now however,
Chicano exploitation is being
challenged at the industrial level
as well.

The challenges and reper-
cussions originate with the Farah
Manufacturing Company, a ma
jor U.S. supplier of men, wo-
men, and children slacks. The
story of the Farah workers and
their attempt thus far to union
izc and bi-comc part of the huge
Amalgamated Clothing Workers
is :i long, complex, and confus
mg series of cvcnts. One thing
that is certain is that the Mexi-
con Aincriciin workers who com
prise tlz'i’i of lrllt‘llll‘s work forci-
linw- xyslciiialically liccn put
down, ltt‘|)l from organizing, and
cxplnili-d at llic hands of Farah's
innnagcincnt and the cxisting lo-
cal powcrs. Much of what has
liiippcnl-rl to datc has liccn legal

LRll Reacts

The ways in which Farah has
rcspoudcd to its cmploym-s have
been challcngcd by the Niilional
Labor Relations Board in Allin-
qiicrquc. New Mcxico. The
Board has accused Farah of a
Wlfll' var -ly of abuses. it lists:

1 Farah “maintained a Closc
watch chr and survvilliincc of,
lll(' working [into activities" of
Vill'ltlllh groups of workers cm-
ploycd in different plants and
ill-partincnts “for the purpose of
intimidating llicsc cmploym-s
from giving support to or Ullil‘l"
wise bcing sympatlictic to the
union."

2. Farah ‘curtniled all talking
ninoung employees during work»
unit time when the previous prac-
licc was to pcrmit employees to
talk during working limc, pro-
vnlcd such talk did not lnll'rft'l’l'
with the work."

ii. Farah “warned uinployci-s
that thosi- who bccamc actch
for thc union could cxpccl harsh
lrI-almcnl" from the company.

-l. Farah “transferred from its
Gall-way pliiiit to the iatcway
machine shop i-iriployi-t-s who
wcrc known to lii- sympathetic
for, or prominciilly idcntil'icd

8. Farah “confiscated union
authorization cards which were
then being used by employees
for the purposes of solicitation
in the plant during nonework
time."

9. Farah “advised employees
that things would go bad for
them because they had union
authorization cards in the plant
and were soliciting for the union
on lion-work time."

10, Farah “questioncd cm~

sympathics and support."

Spread the Word

The job now is to inform llH'

justices that arc being waged
against the strikcrs. A nation
widc boycott of Farah slacks has
bccn organized by thc ACWA

FINANCIAL AID FOR THE FARAH STRIKERS in El Paso is contributed by members
of the Steelworkers Union employed at the American Sine/ting and Refining Company.
Picture shows a collection made at the plant gate this month. Other unions in El Paso and
around the country are supporting the union’s consumer-boycott campaign and are con-
tributing funds to the strike ellort,
