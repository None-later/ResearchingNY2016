You don't usually find insurance
companies out to save guys under 25
money on their auto insurance. Because
—let's face it—statistics show that young
drivers aren't the world's best insurance
risks.

But that's young male drivers as a
group. And that's also insurance com-
panies as a group.

We at the Colonial Penn Insurance
Company see things diiierently.

We realize that, no matter what
your age, you're still an mdivtdual. And
that being young doesn't automatically
make you a bad driver.

You may, in Iact, be a good driver
and a good insurance risk.

And you may qualin for our special
young driver rates.
