To the Editor:

As was the case in 1969, the
SUNYA Psychology Department
is insisting on releasing its best
instructor. What is their gripe
, against Dr. Caroline Waterman?
" III I969, an attempt was made to
get rid of Dr. Waterman which
had to be abandoned. III that
case the main issue boiled down
to the department's right to re-
lease a faculty member contrary
to student opinion There were

I IIIIJII student signatures which
Were strong testImony to Dr.
Watermau's superior teaching

ability, and were the dominant
determinants for III'I' reinstate-
ment
4 Today in 1972, we are III-
volw-II III the same situation
again The faculty has decided
not to grant Dr. Waterman
tenure, again contrary to student
opinion The question again rises
whom this University
caters If it is truly responsive to
student needs and desires, why is
teacher being re

as to

a superior

i Best in Psychology Dept.

leased? Obvioust student con-
sideration is being pushed aside
for other, less relevant issues.

As students of this University,
we feel a great injustice has been
done, not only to ourselves but
to eVery member of the tax
paying community. It is the UIIi~
versity's responsibility to em-
ploy the taxpayer's dollars to
provide the best education pus
sihle for its students. It is
frighteningly evident that de
partmental politics is taking pre
cedence over this goal. It is
neither our aim nor place to get
involved in departmental
politics, but it is our place and
right to see that we get the best
education possible. We feel that
(‘aroline Waterman represents
superior education in every sense
of the word, and we cannot
stand by idly and tolerate such
obvious injustice
