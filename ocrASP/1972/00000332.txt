Washington Merry-Go-Round

Big Brother is Watching

For some time now, Uncle
Sam has been developing a Big
Brother complex.

We have documentary evidence
that federal agencies have almost
unlimited access to confidential
information on citizens. Income
tax returns, social security files
and confidential bank records
are all open to federal snoops.

Not even the mails are inviov
late. Almost any government.
agency can ask the post. office
for a mail check to find out who
is- writing to whom.

Government agents have even
resorted to p king into people's
garbage, For a while, garbage
collectors in the District of
Columbia had a list of 50 persons
whose trash was set aside and
delivered in buriap bags to a
special room in a government
building. There, unidentified
men would come at night to
spirit away the bags for scrutiny.

So, it came as no surprise the
other day when we spotted two
government agents, dressed as
civilians, lugging large plastic
bags filled with trash aboard an
airliner in New York City. The
plane was bound for Washing-
ton.

One of my reporters asked the
men about the bags, but they
only made glib remarks about
helping New York's Mayor John
Lindsay get. rid of the city's
trash.

How widespread the garbage
game is nobody knows. But two
retaurant owners from Bowie,
Md, had adifferent encounter
with Uncle Sam on a train re-
cently The travelers, Kenneth
Gill and Donald Rembert, dis-
cussed the Watergate bugging in-
cident. They merely talked
about what they had read in the
newspapers.

A few days- later, however, a

Secret Service agent knocked on
Gill‘s door and proceeded to
question him about his know—
ledge of the Watergate affair.

It's only 1972; 1984 is still 12
years away. But, apparently, Big
Brother is already watching.

—AROUND THE USA

Lest We Forget‘President
Nixon told visitors privately the
other day that he was distressed
over the IT’I‘ and Watergate scan-
dals, but that he didn't think
they would hurt him on election
day. They were too complicated,
he said, for the public to tinder-
stand. The President also comv
menth that the public‘s
memory on government scandals
was short. He suggested that the
voters have already forgotten,
for example, what the I'I‘T scan-
dal was all about.

America, a Sleeping Nation

by Glenn von Nostitz

When George McGovern “calls
America home" he sounds alot
like the apple-pie baking house-
wife standing on the back porch
yelling for Johnnie to come in
and wash his hands because din-
ner‘s ready, But Johnnie doesn't
show up; Johnnie ignores his
mother's calls.

Well, America is nlot like
Johnnie. Somewhere back there,
somewhere between Cambodia
and the Democratic Convention,
lit-tween SST and ITT, thi- na~
tion disappeared. It's difficult to
pinpoint exactly when it hap-
pened, but the nation stopped
listening and began ignoring dur-
ing the past. two yr-ars.

Until last week at the Jane
Fonda extravaganza I thought
Ami-rica might be hiding on the
campuses, but now I know bel-
tur The gym was half empty and
the audience flew paper air~
plant-s during the puppet show.
Jane Fonda spoke the old rlie~
loric and then alol iif pr-oplc
thought they better go back to
Illt‘ll’ rooms to study or have a
good time rather than listen to
the other speakers. The applause
was polite and controlled

William Kuristlor spoke in that
same gym two years ago to a
greater then capacity crowd The
ri-sputisc was wildly enthusiastic
and UIH‘ can't help but compare
it with the dragged out, somber
I“Ulldil affair.

Political buttons seem to have

inevitable smile buttons. ContrOA

of Indochina and the millions on

there are no riots. The bombers

Faggotales

by Ronnie S.

Hello again...went on vacation
last week to my summer home
in Brooklyn. It. is lovely this
time of year. We have alot of
ground to cover today, so out
with pencils and paper, and let
us begin.

Apropos for the Oct. 21,
university farce, and keeping up
with our six week objective of
educating the masses by throw-
ing sunshine into their closets,
we shall today discuss a long
forgotten art. that is rapidly re-
appearing on the SUNYAmmpus;
namely finding sex partners in
the public men's rest roorm. Yes
dears, it's true... your mother was
right, there are dirty old men
lurking in the “boys” rooms,
wanting to commit wanton, pris-
sionatc, sexual acts to your bod-
ies. Only she was wrong on a few
details, first. most. of those “old”
men are really just bashful
young ones, secondly, you
wouldn‘t. mind sharing in those
“disgusting” acts yourself. But
don’t feel ashamed there are
many more like you in this
world, and on this campus; less
than one percent are dirty, and
few are old. Just peek under
some of those closed toilet. stall
doors, and you'll recognize shoes
belonging to some of the most
distinguished members of the
faculty and student body. (Peek
a little liirdier and you'll see some
of the most distinguished “mem-
bers” of the faculty and stuv
dent's bodies.)

Now there are those in the
gay community, particularly the
organizod gay community, who
condemn seeking sex in men's
rooms. And I agree. A public
bathroom is no place to go to
find love, happiness, or a mean-
ingful life. But if you remember
whr-rr- you left your life, and

"It is the court's belief that

you are now happy, and you just
want. some free, fast,
old-fashioned orgasmic sex,
THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE!
Besides most of the condemners
have tried it once, and if they
haven’t they shouldn't. be critici-
zing the seekers-of-truth
armngus. Now for the nitty-
gritty... where are these men's
rooms, you ask? EVERY-
WHERE! In humanities, earth
science, social science, physics,
and the library. On the quads, in
your dorms, and even your suite.
In public parks, public baths,
and the subway. (On the New
York BM'I‘ I recommend, Utica
Ave, Columbus Circle<59th st.,
125th St.., and Broadway Nas-
sau. IRT' Wall St., Fulton St.,
and Times Square. Why not walk
up to the token booth, give the
guy a dollar, say “one, please.
And the change in nickels", and
make a day of it.)

But. back to the campus... the
most. “in” place, and I mean
THE “in” place at. SUNYA,is a
little knrJWn men's room on the
first floor of the campus center.
No, not the big one by the
candy machines, this one is
much more private. Go beyond
the candy machines, but not as
far as the cafeteria staircase.
Stop. Now turn left and go all
the way to the windows. Stop.
Now turn left and go through
the Exit door. (Never knew an
exit was there, did you?) Now
through the other door straight
ahead. Stop. You should be fac-
ing a ladies room. Now turn
slowly to your left and iioila.
There it is. Paradise lost. Your
home away from home. But.
time is short (and 50's this space)
so... quickly enter and look
around. Yes it's small, but how
much room do you need? Now
go into one of the stalls, pull
down your pants, lock the door,
and sit. Wait until someone uses
the stall next to you. Then cas-
ually pat yoii-- foot near the
opening where he can see it. If
he pate in return, you‘re in
business. If not, stop, wait for
someone else, and start. again. If
he should pat his foot, stop
patting yours, write “Hi” on a
piece of toilet paper, and slip it
to him. (Don't. sign your name!)
If he sends back a message (such
as “Hello"), it's time to quit
stalling and get to the meat of
the matter, Write down what
you like to do, or ask him what
he likes. Your choices are' being
passive and/or active during the
act. of fellatio, and/or being pass-
ive and/or active during anal-
vgenitirl intercourse (sucking
and/or fucking, respectively).
Once that’s decided, the passtve
member of the former, or the
active member of the latter, guts
int.o thr- stall of the other. Lock
the door behind you and... Fini.
Sit back and enjoy yourself.
Now wasn't that simple? "But.
ah", you say, ” what it' someone
comes in and seer: the four
l'r-rxt'l”, tlrrod question. and I
wouldn't lead you this far witii~
out a solution would I‘.’ of
course not, silly. It's simple; take
a large shopping bag With you.
After you've fuurid ii partner,
open it up and let him stand
inside of it. If someone enters
and looks under the door, all
they'll see is two feet with a
shopping bag Ill'lWL‘L'll. Smart,

Got. all that down? Good...
