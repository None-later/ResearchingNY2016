Up-And-Coming Heavies

by Greg Shaw

A Iterna liue Features Service

How many of us can remember
a time when there was just
“rock” and everybody who
listened to it liked approxi-
mately the some stuff?

Nowadays the dividing lines
are pretty clear. The subteen
audience is hooked on music
that has evolved from bubble-
gum to a sureﬁre popular hit
formula based on common
archetypes of innocence. With
the Partridge Family, the Jack.
son Five, the Osmonds, and all
their spinoffs, and a large second
rank including groups like the
Gallery and Daniel Boone, sub-
teen rock has more than ever
become a world of its own.

Those past their early 20's are
either sticking with the remnants
of the lute—'GO's hard rock move-
menl. or embracing the new laid-
back, shelter-seeking folk music.

Right now it's the in-bctween
segment, the teenagers, who are
making the most waves with
their musical tastes. They lean to
the so-called "heavy" rock,
whose roots can be traced hack
1.0 1066'. it's one of the few areas
of rock where any experimenta-
tion is taking place.

The second wave of heavy
groups from Detroit has dried
out and the third, composed
mostly of English groups like
Black Sabbath, is still coasting
along. Now a fourth wave is
upon us, made up of groups who
seem to be popping up out of
nowhere and everywhere. Some
of them are dreadfully bad and
others show promise.

The thing to remember about
heavy rock is the importance of
riffs. The music is built on riffs
and rhythmic sequences that
through repetition pound the
song into your bones, if done
effectively. A heavy rock group
rises or falls on its ability to
invent new riffs and elaborate on
them in an interesting fashion.

Here's a few of the new-
comers:

" Highway Robbery opens
their first album (RCA 4735)
with a good solid pusher called
"Mystery Rider," followed by
anot er fast one, "Fifteen," and
by " uzy Woman," which starts
on ii cumbersome bass line but
builds into it Cream-style amA
phetamine lead guitar rampage.
Slide two hits two slow ones and
it fairly good closing number
called "Promotion Man." All
things considered, Highway Rob-
bery is one of the best new

outings I‘ve heard lately. They
have a good, loud, almost-
imaginative guitarist, strong vo-
coin, and all they really luck at
this point in a well-defined per-
sonality, I think they’ll develop
one soon.

‘ Although they sound heavily
English, Styx is from Chicago,
and they're produced by the
same guy who was responsible
for the Shadows of Knight a few
years back. Their sound is
largely organ-based and their
singing resembles the harmonies
of Grand Funk or Chicago. They
have a long suite called “Move-
ment For the Common Man"
that includes some interesting
effects, and they cook at times
on the other songs, but they
don't seem to have the necessary
drive to reach the top in their
chosen genre.

‘ Much closer to what it’s all
about is Ursa Major, whose
debut album (RCA 4777) hits
every base from the demonic
scare-chords of Amon Duul II to
n “Buck to the Land" number in
the Deep Purple style and an
obligatory quiet song, "In My
Darkest Hour," that’s actually
good. But "Liberty and Justice"
is it dull song based on an ex-
tremely boring riff, so these guys
miss getting top honors.

‘ ’l‘hat distinction goes to
White Witch (Capricorn 0107)
which to my mind hon every
thing a group needs to command
attention in the heavy swecpv
strikes. The singer has an incredi-
ble range, and the group shows
an uncanny ability tosound like
Block Sabbath at their best, yi-t
they also manage to do II song
like “Slei-pwulk" that sounds
like Abbey Ifoud if it llitil been
recorded by the Steve Mllll'l‘
Hand. 'l'bcir riffs arc connislcnlly
inVi-ntivv, the songs all move und
ki-i-p one fast-intich with their
use of special cffcctii. They also
appear] to lltc Jesus Freaks with
"Help Mc Lord," the hippies
willt “ll's So Nicc to Be
Stoned," and for those who re-
quire a gimmick (practically
cvcryliody these tiny») they've
got mystic symbols scriiwliid iill
ovcr liicir focus and ii lot of
promotional Iiokurn about iipiri-
turil awareness and psychic
Witchcraft. A Winning combina-
tion. 'l'hey'rc from (iiiorgin and
should go fur.
