Lat Friday marked the open-
ing performance of the RP! Play-
en in a fnclnating new musical
based on the songs and self of
Jacques Brel, the national folk
hero of France. The cast of four
faced the tremendous task of
performing the songs so that the
audience could actually ‘feel’
them, and very skillfully very
professionally, the messages of
Jacques Brel were conveyed to
us, the viewers, or rather, us, the
participants, and we were left
awestruck by their profundity.

The cast, which has been in
rehearsal for over a month, in-

Last fall, star baritone Robert
Merrill celebrated his 25th anni-
versary with one of the world's
leading opera houses —- the
What. This fall, for the first time,
Merrill is host of a national
television series — International
Performance on PBS.

Merrill will be seen each Thurs—
day night at 9:00 PM and each
Sunday at 4:00 PM on Channel
17 on the new series which is
bringing the best of recent
opera, ballet, and classical music
concerts from European tele-
vision to American Viewers.

Host Merrill introduces each
program and provides his own
unique insight into the music,
the composers. the choreograph-
ers, and the stars.

Merrill, who opened a busy
1972-73 season at the Met re—
cently in Verdi's “La Traviata,"
said that he accepted the invita-
tion to host International Per-
formance because he believes
television will play an increasing‘
ly important role in classical
music, and PBS is in the fore-
front of that effort.

“Color television provides the
same opulent productions of
opera and ballet previously seen
only in places like the Met,” he
said.

Merrill is particularly concern-
ed with taking classical music off
ii pedestal and giving it more
mass appeal.

“Rather than keeping people
away from concert halls, because
they can see elaborate product-
ions at home, television gels
people out by introducing a
much broader public to the
world of classical music," he

Acclaimed by critics as one of

the great natural baritones of
this century, Robert Merrill is

also one of the few opera stars
to venture successfully into
other areas of entertainment.

He has recorded music of the
Broadway stage including
“Porgy and Bess," “Showboat,”
and "Carousel," and recently he
entered the world of musical
comedy on stage as Tevya in
“Fiddler on the Roof," breaking
box ofﬁce records in several
cities.

Through the years, Merrill has
also received numerous cultural
awards, honorary degrees and
critical accolades coveted
throughout the music world.

On television he has been a
frequent guest of Johnny Carson
and other talk show hosts, in-
cluding Mike Douglas, Dick Ca-
vett. Marv Grifﬁn and Ed Sulli«
van. Among his favorite tele~
vision topics are his semi—pro
baseball career and his interest in
golf.

Merrill was born in Brooklyn,
NY, He says that like most
Brooklyn kids of his generation
he was born with a silver base-
ball in his mouth -- and if
itwercn't for his musical talent
he might have pursued a baseball
career. (It is Merrill's rendition
of the national anthem that is
heard at all New York Yankees
home games.)

As a teenager Merrill earned
some money for singing lessons
pitching for a semi- pro team
called the Brooklyn Kings. He
also worked in his father‘s shoe
business, and on the New York
resort circuit as a singer, an
emcee, and as straight man for
comic Red Skelton.

During one of those resort
atinls a vacationing performer's
agent heard Merrill and arranged
an audition. The next Sunday he
found himself the featured Dari-
tone soloist on a coast-to-coaat

which, in effect, is the world as

itA‘fter theshow, I talked to the
performers. They-were very ex-
cited and enthused about the
reaction of the audience. Each
generally agreed that an atmos-
phere of understanding and
accord was generated, mainly
because it was being performed
to and by people who can relate
to the words of Brel, and accept
them in agreement. Both young
and old alike are inspired by his
songs, but yet there is an open-
mindcdness necessary for their
comprehension beneath the
superficial - sometimes comic,
sometimes sad—outer story.

Besides the penetrating lyrics
and the cast's whole involvement
of their selves, credit must cer-
tainly be given to the superb
casting and guidance of Brant,
the director. The mood of the
songs was heightened by the
impressive accompaniment of
the musicians, directed by Bob
Dvorak, and the sensational eff-
ects and illusions created by the
lighting. The stage was an in-
clined platform, dcecked with an
adaptable scenery, whose slant-
ing achieved the impression of
the actors coming to the aud-
ience, and also gave the cast the
added experience of learning to
wall: at an angle of about thirty
degrees.

The play will be performed
next week, the 20th and the
215t of October, at 8:30pm.
And, instead of having to travel
to Paris to hear Brcl's songs, you
can hear it all at RPI in Troy at
Lounge 15, over the bridge and
across from the Troy Armory.
Tickets are available at the door,

NBC, Radio City Music Hall, and
later the Met, followed.

Merrill is married to the former
Marion Machno, a graduate of
the Juilliard School of Music and
a concert pianist. They met in
Manhattan when their mutual
cleaning lady, noting their
common interests, arranged a
date.

The Merrills have two teen-
aged children, David and Liz-
anne, who are both musically
inclined. David plays guitar and
has formed his own rock group
and Lizanne was on the stage
last summer with her father as
one of Tevya‘s daughters in
“Fiddler on the Roof."

and that lU/lt’ll [lender did do f/ll‘lll, llicv incri-

pollution was perpetuated.

Selwyn made other discoveries about the pond He
found that dissolved oxygen (leading to culropicaf
ion and tlitI premature death of a body of walch
was not yet a problem, but might be in the future.

No study was needed to show the pond is not
stagnant. There is a current in the pond, or at least
regular movement of yvatcr, aided by the sucking
action of the overflow drain that draws in water and
fortunately, oil, too. Water rushing in from storm
sewers and the action of what Selwyn lli’lli'VI‘S lo hv
underground springs, keeps the steady flow passing
down the overflow drain which connects, l‘\'l'lilllz|l

But Gary Selwyn could not provide ziiiswvrs to
every question. He thinks a chemical analysis of the
gas bubble that rise from the bottom of the lake
would be useful.

He wants an analysis of the sludge on the bottom
of the lakenthe sludge, he writes, may "wcll be
causing the death of the fish if vuriuos heavy metal
complexes are present." -

He would like to see a precise tesl for phosphorus
in the water.

And he would like to find why a tiny stream that
enters the pond on the northwest near lndian quad
is orange; he thinks it may he tainted by rusting
metal barrels embedded in the stream, but he isn't
sure.

He wants the pond and surrounding wooded area
better used by students, and better protected, loo.
Recently, workers sprayed and killed a number of
shrubs in the mistaken belief that they were poison
ivy. Dr. Kelly of the biology department, attending
Monday's meeting, expressed his anger zit lhv
spraying. He thinks the area is particularly valuable
because of the great diversity of plant life there, “1'
would like the area preserved as an educational
resource for the university.

Gary Selwyn urged al Monday‘s mot-ling lliul [he
