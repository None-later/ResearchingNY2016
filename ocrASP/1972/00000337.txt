Albany ran all over New Paltz.
In the first game, State won on
timely basehits by Bill Lapp,
Dan DeForest, and Terry Kenny.
Kevin Quinn who upped his
overall pitching record to 4-2,
fell behind 2-0 quickly in the
first inning. Albany, then tied

been achieved by shutting out
the opposition. Ken has also

It was a fine fall season and
by the looks of the fall squad,

if the co—captains and Coach
Burlingame can shake off the

Danes Win ’Big One’; Defense- Outstanding

by Bill Heller

In a wildly jubilant locker
room with choruses of “We’re
No. 1" providing an ample back-
ground, the Albany Great Dane
football machine celebrated its
latest and biggest accomplish-
mentz‘a sweet 16-14 victory over
highly-rated Hudson Valley
Community College. No one
stopped to ask, "Number one,

of heart-stopping football as the

lead changed hands four times
and the contest wasn't decided
till Albany's Dom Pagano drop-
ped enemy quarterback Rich
Sprague with six seconds left. By
then, HVCC had threatened a
miraculous comeback by getting
down to the Dane 40, but time
just ran out. Pagano's sacking
was a fitting ending, as all day

ever.

 

 

 

 

Out of eight “do or die"
situations that Albany came
through on, ﬁve were defensive,
two offensive, and one was pro-
vided by coach Bob Ford him-
self. The latter came when he
directed quarterback John Ber-
tuzzi to be trapped for a safety,
very late in the game, rather
than risk a punt from the end

a key series to keep the game in
reach. Key tackles were made by
Ron Gardner, 'l‘im Myers, Vinnie
Pearce, and Frank Villanova.

Offensively, give a whole
bunch of credit to Marvin Perry.
who broke off a 67 yard scam-
per to set up Carvin Payne’s 5
yard TD in the lst half. The play
came with the Danes backed up
to their 15, and really woke the
slumbering offense up.

The winning TD was truly a

an l-IV defender all over him,
Baxter nonetheless made a leap-

Ing grab coming down with six
points for his teammates.

So the Danes made the big
play all day and won the big
game. They made mistakes, but
who thinks of mistakes after you
beat a team with HVCC's cro-
dentials. After a 61-8 embarrass-
ing loss two seasons ago, and a
