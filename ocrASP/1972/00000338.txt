by Nathan Salant ~

The Albany Boaters lost twice
last week. once by Oswego on
Saturday. and by Union on
Wednesday. The Oswego game
saw the Danes score two goals in
30 seconds to take a halftime
lead. only to lose the lead and
the game 3-2. Wednesday‘s game
versus Union saw a sudden and
complete breakdown of Al-
bany's only strongpoint this year
—-defcnse. ‘

Saturday's game at' Oswego
looked like many other previous
ones as Oswego scored to lead
1-0. At this point. Leon Sedefian
was inserted into the left; half-
back position. and a sudden
metamorphosis occurred. For
some reason which cannot be
established Leon made the team
click. Suddenly the pressure was
on the Oswego defense. Passes
were on target. shirts on goal
tripled. Imd the Albany offense
came alive. With two minutes
left in the half. Seth-Tran si'm’etl
on it 90 foot drIVe. 'l'lrtrty
seconds later. a pass from
Sedel'ian was driven by Larry

Herzog to put Albany ahead 2-1
as the half ended. When play
resumed._for some inexplicable
reason, the Danes suddenly
stopped playing good ball.
Maybe this was due to the fact
that Sedefiun did not start the
second half. The Danes were all
back on defense. and Oswego
put two goals away. despite a
spectacular play by Scdcfiiin to
stop it breakaway after he had
just been reinserted into the
line-up. Once again the Danes
came alive. but just could not
score. The game ended 3-2.
Oswego,

Wednesday’s game saw a few
changes in the Danes' play. First
of all. their excellent defense
suddenly fell apart, Secondly.
the overall quality of play de-
teriorated. and thirdly. they lost
to one of the Worst teams in
eollige soccor. 'l‘he Danes had
tied the score at 2-2. via goals by
Larry llirr'rog and John Htreeter.
when the whole team just fell
apart. and the result was a 5-2
loss.

the season now, and it’s time to
take a look at why the Danes are
1-7. The truth of the matter is
that the team has played good
ball in most of its games. and
could just as easily be 4-3. The
team has been a victim of had
breaks and inconsistency. A
truly superlative performance
has been turned in all year by
Larry Hermg. who started the
year as a sweeperback. and was
subsequently put on the front
line to toughen up the offense.
The result has been a goal a
game for Herzog. Bruce Michaels
has any filled the gap left when
Herzog moved up, and the de-
fense as' a whole has been excel-
lent (with the, exception of the
Union game). The big problems
have been a lack of scoring (an
average of L7 goals/game). poor
halfback play. and a lack of
players. The whole squad con‘
sists of just If) guys, thus a grand
total of 4 subs. Every player on
the team has had at least one
outstanding game, but then
turns around and plays poorly in
the next two or three games.
The simple question is. why are
the Danes consistently Incon~

Itigbt now the season comes
down to one thing the Univer-
sity (Ti-liter Tournament Versus

also salvage a decent record of

on that Friday and Saturday
afternoon. to come to the soccer
field bleachers, After all. the
team has played better on the
road. and to quote one of the
players.

“I'd rather play on the road
because We get to play in front
of a big crowd. You always play
better with lots of people
watching. I just can‘t understand
why the students .at Albany
State are Inore interested in
drugs and t.v. soap operas than
in a team that represents their
school After all. it is their
school. isn't it?"

Is it your si‘hool‘.’ If so. why

don't you come out and watch
at least one of those games Who
knows. you might even give the
team the moral support it needs
to win, something you have not
done yet this year,

“Which way do we go?" —
That was the question of the day
as the Great Danes barriers suc-
cessfully defended their crown
at the Merrimack Invitational
last Saturday. Running on a
course with no markers and few
officials. five Albany runners
broke away from the field of
one hundred and seemed like
Vinnie Reda. Nick DeMarco. Jim
Shrader. Bill Sorel. and Carlo
Cherubino would easily tie for
first place. John Koch was in the
next trio of runners and Phil
Doyle was in fifteenth position
less than one hundred~fifty yards
behind the leaders.

However with th rec-quarters of
a mile remaining, a turn was
missed and the field followed
the Albany team. Realizing the
mistake. the first twelve runners
turned around only tofind that
the course had been rerouted, As
:1 resulted, runners who lltt(l
trailed by one hundred yards
found themselves ahead of the
orrgiiiril lenders. Thus at the
finish. Instead of having lllt‘ first
five or sixth places. the (treat

A strong Albany team takes on
the best of the SUNYAC
SCHOOLS in the SUNYAC
Championship this Saturday
morning at Albany. The Danes
who have been in the conference
only two years try to run their
record to a perfect 20.

Albany will be hard pressed by
a number of schools. all who
threatened them last year. Coach
Munsey feels that the top threat
is last year's sixth place finisher
Cortland State. Cortland has
completely redone their team.
which is led by George Pfeiffer.
who has broken three course
records this year, He is one of
the leading contenders for the
individual honors.

Last year's second and third
place teams Fredonia and Gen
i-seo rrre tough again this year.
Fredoitia has it well balanced
learn which is an advantage in
this type of meet (ieneseo is led
by Joe ('ontario who has set two

though there are some top indiv
Iiluals on them Last year's top

SUNYAC runner in the NCAA
championships is back again as
strong as ever. F‘ran Verdolivn of
Oswego State is undefeated in
both duct and triple meets this
year. He should be near the
front at the end.

This is the competition the
Albany team will face in trying
to defend their title. Albany's
top three runners. Vinnie Reda.
Nick DcMarco and Jim Shradcr.
will all be contending for the
lead, The rest of the Albany
team will have the responsibility
of clinching the title. How high
the Albany team finishes will
depend on how high these melt
finish. lf past performances are
any indication these men will be
fighting for positions in the top
ten, The Albany learn Will prob-
ubly go out fast trying to burn
out the opposition. something
they how had success in doing
recently.

The llarriers are happy I bi-
able to defend their title on I'llt'll'
