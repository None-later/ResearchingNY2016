Reports of Campus Crime Decrease May

Be Deceiving, Security Ch

by Mindy Altman

It may seem to many people
that crime on campus is down
from last year to this year be-
cause there is much less dis-
cussion about it. Reports are
circulating that the crime rate
has indeed dropped. However,
this is not necessarily true.

According to James Williams,
Director of Security, the only
thing that is down is the number
of reported crimEs. What this
means is that there are many
crimes committed which are not
being reported, including some
serious assaults. Williams asserts
that the only reports which are
included in official <11!li\llt‘\ ini-
those that people come and tell
security about. He says that this
year security has found out
about a number of :ll’lllt‘tl rob
herics that have taken place on
quads and which had not iii-en
reported.

However, it does seem to Will
Iams, by the type of crimes

being committed, that there is
not as much hard drug use as
there was last year. This is in
evidence because there do not
seem to be as many “stealing to
buy" type of thefts. But, the
“opportunity thefts" still occur.
This is the type of theft that
takes place when students leave
their doors unlocked, or leave
their belongings, such as wallets,
unattended in the library. The
library is a target area for such
thefts.

Williams believes that there
have probably been as many
crimes coniiiiItIi-d~ for instance.
this September as llieie were last

have been reported from Alumni

Quad as well as the uptown
campus, even though on Alumni
Quad it. is easier to spot strangers
because of the corridor system.
whereas, on the uptown campus,
the suites are more isolated,
making intruders more difﬁcult
to spot.

Why aren't many thefts re-
ported? Often, in cases of minor
theft, students feel that report»
ing the theft is more trouble
than the whole situation is
worth. And in cases of larger
burlaries and offenses, people
would rather not be responsible
for having the offender put in
Jail for two or three years. Many
times people do not realize that
things are missing, and many
other times, when they do, there
Is the feeling that reporting the
theft won't do any good any
way There is also a fear, on the
part of many people of retalia
tioii from the siispeet's friends,
if the erirne Is reported How
ever, according to Williams, such
retaliation has never occurred

Year to Date

 

 

 

This year, in hopes of provid»
ing more security and services
for the dorms, and also in help-
ing to prevent vandalism and
possibly some crimes, the Stu-
dent Secuirty Patrol is at work
again. Two students on each of
the ﬁve uptown and downtown
quads, plus two more students
for the parking lots are on patrol
from 7 pm. to 1 am. every
night. The program seems to be
successful. Part of the success
stems from the increased inter-
action between security men and

ief Asserts

students. Hopefully, the Student
Patrol will be expanded to day-
time hours also.

All in all, even though a num-
ber of efforts, including the Stu-
dent Patrol, are being made to
protect the university com-
munity, there is no conclusive
evidence that the crime rate is
down. Everyone is therefore
urged to take whatever pre-
caustion they can to prevent
crime and to report crimes to
security if and when they occur.

Environment Bond
Up For Vote Soon

There has been increasing con-
cern in New York about the
quality of our environment. It is
generally conceded that some-
thing must be done to halt the
rising levels of pollution in our
land, water, and air.

The 1965 Pure Waters bond
issue, which completed 342 sew-
age treatment plants, treating
2.8 billion gallons of raw sewage
each day, is set to expire this
year, and many enVIron-
mentalists have called for an
even more comprehensive mea-
sure.

This year the Environmental
Quality Bond Act is up for vote.
Edward Kramer, director of the
Environmental Bond Coalition
says that its passage is “allholut.e-
ly necessary to preservo the qua-
lity of life, in the Empire State.’
It would provide:

7.14650 million to help com-
"lul‘lltlt‘h construct new needed
sewage treatment facilities. This
money will be used to augment
federal and local funds for budd-
Ing the treatment facilities.

-$l.’)0 million to abate air
pollution, Clean air is a major
state goal and a serious eon

tinuing problem. The State is
insisting that pollution caused
by industry and private sources
be cleaned up by the polluters
themselves, However, in some
cases-schools, hospitals, munici-
pal incinerators-public buildings
are the polluters, and this por-
tion of the bond issue is to buy
air pollution abatement equip-
ment for these government—
owned facilities.

--$|75 million to help com-
munities begin recycling their
solid wastes. The vast mountains
of garbage and trash this year
will add up to 26 million tons in
New York State. This portion of
the bond issue will enable muni-
cipalities to make a start on
treating and reusing this garbage
“recycling it,

---‘lil75 million to acquire for-
est lands, and other unique
tracLs of land throughout the
state which are important for
ecological reasons, to purchase
wetlands, and to obtain sites for
reereational purposes such as
beaches and parks.

For oiiee, instead of just talk-
Irig about the pollution problem
the public has the opportunity
to get out and vote for a cleaner
and healthier environment by
voting for the iiivn'onmental
Bond Act, which appears as Pro-
position One on the November 7
ballot.
