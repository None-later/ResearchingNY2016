America’s

Mr Weintraub served in Vietnam with the Army‘s 1015i Airborne. Since
his discharge he has been with Pacific News Service in San Francisco.

by Peter Weintraub

“They get back and they're
like displaced persons," said an
official of the California Depart-
ment of Human Resources. He
was speaking of the almost three
million veterans of the Vietnam
war who have been coming
home to America, virtually un-
noticed, for the better part. of a
decade. Without the fanfare ac-
corded their father, they haVe
returned to families and home—
towns seeking to pick up the
threads of the lives they left
behind. Yet for many reasons,
the transition back into the civir
Iian mainstream has been fraught
with disillusionment, bitterness,
and all too often. failure.

In almost eVery negativi- sta
tistieal index, Vl(‘ll'lillll veterans
come out at or near the top of
US society. They are unemploy
ed at. a rate that exceeds the
national average by one and a
half times. They get divorced,
use drugs, and commit crimes at
rates far out ol' proportion to
their numbers. Ironically, llll'
authorities charged to deal with
the problem of the returning
Vietnamese veteran, particularly
those in the Veterans Atlniini
stration, are extremely out ol
touch with the realities of the
situation.

It is not that tl'tc officials at
the VA are uninterested iit tltc
Vietnam veteran, In fact, thi-ri-
have even been charges that tltc
VA is pampering Vietnam vets :it
tltc expense of Korean and
World War II Veterans. Rather.
tltc problem lies iii the approach
tltc VA is taking to deal with tin-
participants of what is now gctlc
rally regarded as the most (In
bious war in American history
As oitc disaffected \ictcran put
it, the VA “still think they're
talking to some guiig-ho trooper
coming home from Iwo John to
a grateful nation.“

Administration Building, Martin
J. May, Assistant Director of
Veterans Administration for
Northern California dismissed
the idea that his agency lacks
understanding of the Vietnam
vet. “You see," Ite said, recalling
almost thirty years with the VA,
“these men are really not at all
that different from Korean and
World War II veterans. They're
all human beings faced with thi-
problem of readjusting to cm
lian society after fighting a war
This is not easy, but with our
help and their own dcsirc, most
of these men. like their fallici's
before them, will succeed "

May went on to describe the
efforts the VA makes to tll'Itl

Coming Home

Bob is a tall. well-built ex-
infantryman, from the 25th divi-
sion, who returned from Viet-
nam about 14 months ago. At
first, he says. the most difficult
part of his readjustment was
getting used to the loud noises
of urban life which reminded
Mom of the sounds of war.
Gradually Bob realized that a
thind distance had developed
in relationships with people he
had once been close to. liven his
parents, Bob feels, acted differ-
ently towards him after he re-
llllllt‘tl front 'Nam. "I began to
lt't'l that people looked at me as
if I was sortie kind of critriinal,"
llt' siiys, "like all I did in 'Nam
was smoke (l()|)(' and kill bti-
bics "

"llcally the hardest part
about coming home," another
rcccnt rclurnec said, "is trying
to tit hack in exactly where yoti
left off When I came home I
could not wait to see my old
biiildics from school But when
tyc finally got together. there
was something that just wasn't

“I'Vc found in talking With

ki-y says. "that almost all of

period when they get back front
Victnnm. Sonic t’ci-I guilt, many

them feel cut oft from the rest

Mct‘loskcy's belief that thi-
vcti-rans's sense of being igiioi I'll
lies behind these pt'ultlcltt.s is
shared by Dr. (lcorgc Kricger,
(‘liict' ot' the Psychiatry Service
at the sprawling Veterans Admi-
nistration Hospital in l’alo Alto,
(‘alit'ornia I)r. Kricgcr contrasts
tlic hands and parades that greet-
cil tl.<- returning World War II
vctcran With the virtual cold
shoulder that his Vii-tnain coun
tcrpiirt fchr. when he comes
lltilllt'. "You iiiiist understand."
says Dr. Krii-gcr. “that most of
tltc Vietnam Veterans are well
aware of tltc Iiomccomings their
fathers received after World War
II 'I'hcy feel all the sacrifices

As a result of tlll this, a trcmcn-
dons amount of bitterness is
created.”

And at tltc cluttcrcd offices of
the Vietnam Veterans Against
tltc War iit San Francisco's Mia
sion district, .Iiicli McUloski-y
sounded an chn more direct
wnrntng. “Perhaps you recall tltc
