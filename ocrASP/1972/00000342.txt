The office is inset, twice-
removed from the crowded cor-
ridor of the Business Adminis-
tration building, nestled behind
an emptywaitingroom. It is the
usual white cubicle with tubular
windows and a view of parked
cars. Surprisingly, there is no
desk; instead a narrow table-
shelf extends the length of one
wall. It is cluttered like a desk,
with tape-recorder, typewriter
and professional journals.

“The center is no more than
the people in it. it‘s just the
staff."

Dr. John Tucker, director of
the University Counseling Cen-
ter, is short and dark with a cleft
chin and rectangular glasses. He
wears a dark striped suit and a
bright tie, patterned with
swirling Egyptian life symbols.
His voice is soft except when he
leans back to laugh. Beside him,
Mrs. Al Gene Biggs, recent addi-
tion to the center’s staff, listens
silently. Her soft Afro-cut hair,
oval face, and long legs are more
Ebony cover girl than psycholo»
gist.

The Counseling Center is five
professional counselors and
seven interns in advanced stages
of doctoral study. Their
building-block offices form the
foundation of one side of the
B.A. building, set side-liy-side
behind four waiting rooirg‘wlth
black, closed co’rri or
doors—'1 12 through 115. The
center shares the responsibility
for counseling the University
community with Resident Assis-
tants and Directors, University
College advisement, Health Scr-
vice, Graduate School of Social
Welfare, Placement office, EUl’
counseling, Financial Aids. Mid-
dle Earth, and 5300. Under.
standably, the Counseling Center
is continually defining its role.

Dr. Ruckcr leans forward.

"We are like a community of
counseling services. All the ser-
vices make great efforts to inter-
act with each other Bob

places with an emotional

Bureaucracy?

"Don't think of it as bureau-
cratic. I don't think that‘s right.
The bureaucracy lets us live
freely because they recognize
that we are the outlet for peo-
ple. We are the place where
people go when they don’t feel
they can talk to the bureau-

cracy.

 

Ms. Elizabeth Burns

What do they talk about?

"I suppose the most frequent
problem is decision—making.
Basically, we see people who,
because they can't resolve their
problems, become increasingly
frustrated, don't function as well
as they should. A typical situa-
tion might be an English major
wondeiing what he might do to
make a living. Or other decisions
about relationships. Someone,
for example, living off-campus
who spends most of his time at
home doesn't have the time or
the pathways to make relation
ships. The people who see us
about this are usually people
who have some apprehensions
about making social relation-
ships, inore than likely de-
fending themselves against (lei/el-
oping relationships.

“We sometimes get students
who just can't decide about
thcmsclvcs. ‘Whal kind of person
do I want to bc‘." ‘Whal kind of
life do i want to lead'." ‘l'm not

about it.

Drugs?

“It is not uncommon for a
student who comes to us to be
involved with drugs. But very
often that‘s not the problem. in
other words, a student will come
to us if he has: a drug iproblem
We do have students coming to
us with drug problems. But most
frequently they come to us
about something else and we see
that drugs are in their life some-
where. Sometimes very promin~
ently, sometimes not impor-
tantly. So. i would say yes, we
deal with drugs, but we view
them in the larger context of the
person's environment.

Sex?

“Again I have to put it in
context. We tend to deal with
sex in terms of the person. And
sex, in the years between seven-
teen and twenty-five is an impor-
tant topic, a serious question.
The biggest problem about sex
used to be guilt. Now much
more prominent are what l
would call frustrating cx-
periences wilh scx. A problem
occurs when a person hears the
kind of stuff our media keeps
telling him. He gets a high expec-
tation of something which is
very difficult to attain. Sex has

Dr. Coffey-“I'd go out on a
limb and say that we’d handle
anything that isn’t being handled
somewhere else on the campus.
Often different members of the
staff have more competency in
certain areas that might better
help the person."

Let's individualize. What's
you r competency?

Dr. Coffey—“My competency,
and it‘s one of the reasons that
l‘m here, is career development.
My concern is the choice of a
career versus a specific job. in-
dustry has jobs; people have
careers. We can't start doing
what the placement office is
doing or should be doing. But
somehow it has to be pointed
out that employment counseling
doesn‘t begin a month before or
a week before graduation."

What kinds of programs and
preparations are there?

Dr. Coffey-~ “Right now there is
nothing. l've been meeting with
other people on campus to find
out what they are doing and
there isn'l anything. One of the
reasons I'm here is to pull it all
together and gel something going.

"One of the places the Coun~
seling Center can offer its
greatest service, and you have to
recognize my bias in saying
this, is on the afl'ectiVe levul,
