Frisbee

WASHINGTON AP—Over a
period of four years. the Navy
spent $375,000 in a scientific
study of Frisbees to see if the
flight characteristics of these
plastic toys could somehow be
adapted for warfare. But it was
no go.

From high atop Hurricane
Mesa in Utah, scientists sent
Frisbees, and clay pigeons as
well, spinning into the air.
Tracking cameras monitored the
flights from the 1,000-foot-high
cliff.

Warfare

As with all flight testing, the
experiments were preceded by
extensiVe wind-tunnel tests at
the Navy Ammunition Depot at
Crane, Ind.

The results of the tests were
reported last month in a paper
entitled “Adaptation of the Fris-
bee Flight Principle to the De-
livery of Special Ordinance."

in the nonclassii'ied paper, the
Navy was careful to note
throughout that Frisbee is “a
registered trademark of the
Whamo Manufacturing Co." of
San Gabriel. Calif.

Tire Settlement

NEW YORK AP—Time and Newsweek magazines
reported Sunday that the United States and North
Vietnam have reached agreement on a peace settle-
ment in Vietnam under which South Vietnam's
President Nguyen Van Thieu would remain until
replaced by a caretaker government. .

Time said, “Hanoi has agreed to negotiate directly
with the Thieu government while the South Viet-
namese president is still in power, which it has said
that it would never do."

The magazine commented that this part of the
United States-North Vietnamese agreement meets a
demand by President Nixon that he not participate
in the down fall of Thieu whom Nixon has promised
never to abandon.

Both magazines said a cese-fire would be in effect
while the negotiations went on.

According to Time, once a ceasefire is established,
three committees would be formed:

Oneﬂun expansion of the international Control
Commission to supervise the ceaseﬁre.

'I‘wo—rA composition of representatives from the
Saigon govr-rnment and thc Provisional Revoluv
tiunary Government maintained by the National
Liberation Front in South Vietnam This commit-
tee, consisting of Communist. ncutraiisl and Thieu
government factions would crcatr- the caretaker
government to replace Thieu.

Threw—A committcc composed of the United
States, North Vietnam, the 'l‘hreu government and
the Provisronul Revolutionary Government.

it would work with the international Control
Commission—which is made up of lndia, Canada
and Poltind'”arbitratrng who controllcd what turri-
tory at the timc ol' tlu- ceasefire, ru-gotiating the
withdrawal and the rclcusc of the prisonch of war
and the other large ovr-mill prohlcnis of ending
combat in Vir-trurm."

Newswcck said [hill after the ccascl'lrc and u
short-Iivcd interim govr-rnmcni, lhcrc would bc a
national clcctioo supervised by France in South
Vietnam.

  
 

USAF On Alert

| scrim at two US. Air Force bases reported sunday‘

that special alerts 'of air transport units, which
they said possibly were in preparation for cvat‘ua»
tion of US. prisoners held by North Vietnam, had
been cancelled. The Pentagon, meanwhile, said no
“unusual action” had been taken with rr-gurd to the
POWs.

The reported alerts, combined with published
reports that an agreement for ending the limlilitics In
Vietnam was near, had giVen rim to speculation that
measures were being taken to fly I'm-d Ammﬁm
POWs out of Indochina.
