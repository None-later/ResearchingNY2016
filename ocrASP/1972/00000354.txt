' , by Bill Brina

Kris Kristofferson and Rita
Coolidge graced a smallish,
shamefully unenthusiastic aud-
ience with a truly first-rate per-
formance last Saturday nite. In
defense of the audience, they
might have been bummed out by
the hour-long delay that ensued
when a bass ampliﬁer blew out
during the sound check. The
audience wasn‘t allowed in, and
(typically) norone' bothered to
inform the waiting multitude of
what was going on until after the

doors were opened. And-When '

the concert did get underway,
the sound balance for the ﬁrst
few numbers was horrendous--a
loud, annoying cracking noise
marred the vocals and ruined the
mix.

Thanks to the yeoman service
of the ECC’S Carm [3an that
buzz soon disappeared ano the
bulky system was coaxed into
producing a passable repro-
duction of what the musicians
were laying out. And what they
were laying out was mighty fine.
“Tasty” is an overused cliche in
the music business but it's the
perfect description for the c ire-

ful, sympathetic support that
the Dixie Flyeis, led by organist
Mike Utley, gave both to Kris
and Rita.

Kris was,...well, Kris was Kris.
Kristofferson is an intensely per-
sonal artist, and either you relate
to him or you don’t. It isn’t hard
to be put off by his flat, color-
less voice and the consistently
low-key pacing of his show, and
I guess that, to judge from the
audience's lack of enthusiasm,
many were. After all, it had been
the week of mid-terms...long,
tiring, and drawn out, and the
audience might have preferred
ass-kickin’ music to Kris' melan-
cholia, For some reason, though
--pernaps precisely because I was
as tired and drawn out as I
was--Kristofferson‘s gentle tales
of burnt spirits and lost oppor-
tunities struck very close to
home. To judge from the num-
ber of half—closed eyes and gent-
ly nodding, intensely focused
expressions in the audience, he
struck home often enough to
make the show worthwhile...but
not to enough of the audience to
get the response he deserved.

But the only excuse that can
be offered for the lack of re-

deserved the likes of Cactus.

Mason at Union

by Kevin Daniels

Have you ever attended a
concert where you were de-
prived of your basic, inherent
right to audience silence during a
performance? Well, last Saturday
night the boorishness of the au-
dicnce prevailed again. The disi
respect was not present, mind
you, when Dave Mason was on
stage,but, rather, only when the
two folk singers, Jimmy and
Vella, performed. Though their
performance was quite good, the
crowd chatted, screamed, and
clapped their hands during the
couple's 40-minute set. With
Jimmy on guitar and Vella on
both guitar and electric piano
(she can really waiIEl, we were
treated to an extraordinary
ﬁnale, entitled "Rain." Who
sang the chorus, which consisted
of about 30 or so lines, each
with the word ‘rain.” A great
job, and the audience, as if
trying to make amends for its
earlier lack of respect, gave them

a standing ovation ~ the most
shallow, half-hearted ovation
l’ve ever heard. It was sickening.

The featured act with Dave
Mason came on a little later, and
he beautifully breezed through
almost every number on his
HAlone Togctlii'r‘
few more tunes
“Headket-pcr.” Mason‘s guitar-
playing was impressive, and cs-

album, and a
from

pccially mellow. The band was
very tight, and most of the tunes
came across like their recorded
version except for “Look at
You, Look at Me," which adds a
lot of wali-wah into Mason's
solo. After about an
Mason left to thunderous ap-
plause, only to return with
Jimmy and Vella, who aided in
the vocals and percussion.
Funny — the audience really
seemed to like the two folk-

hour,

singers, once they were singing
with Mason, and, after it was all
chr, the crowd was screaming
for more. Mason came back and
shouted, "This one is just to
bring everybody down so you
can go home W it’s acoustic, and

if you don't want to listen,

li‘uirc."

Overall, the artisLs were really
line, but the audience could
have stayed in lN‘d,

Louis Falco on Friday

SUNYA loves originals! The
Louis Falco Dance Company is
an original and exciting
company making its SUNYA
debut, October 27. Louis Falco
may well be the dancer’s Mar-
shall McLuhan. If he is not, it
remains that they share certain
philosophical premises: namely,
that the message is not the mes-
sage. The medium is.

As a choreographer and a dan—
cer, Falco is concerned that his
dancers be complete theatrical
experiences. He is one of the few
choreographers to use speech in
dance. Intense care is given to
set design, music, and lighting.
His collaboration with other
artists makes for a unique ex-
perience involving all the senses,

In addition to his work with
other artists, Falco has been
collaborating with a group of
scientists from the University of
Michigan, uniting their technical
innovations, with his danci-
artistry. Lloyd Cross, a physicist
at the University, designed the
ﬁrst dance sets using laser beams
for Ftilco's company. In this
kind of work, the dancers bodies
are illuminated by laser beams
arrayed in specific patterns. The
result is that a true .‘l-dimen-
sinnul image of the body is
formed, and it is impossible to
tell visually whether or not the
body is actually there.

Falco integrates his
logy, music, speech, and artistic
settings, with a personal warmth
and il sincere desire to get his
message across to pmph- ll:-
