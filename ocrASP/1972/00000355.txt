injuries as Vinnie Reda had a
bad cold and Nick DeMarco was
hampered by a leg injury which
prevented him from practicing
all week.

As the meet began, Cortland,
the team which was expected to
give Albany the most trouble,
broke out fast. They were led by
their top runner George Pfeiffer.
The Albany team decided to
stay with the pace as previously
planned and not to go out and
chase the fast starting Cortland
runners. Pfeift'er ran the mile in
4:49 which was only 14 seconds
behind the course record pace.
Albany's top runners, Vinnie
Reda and Jim Shrader ran aA1155‘)
mile.

Pfeiffcr continued to set the
pace with a 9:51) two mile mark
with the Albany runners just a
few seconds behind. The toll
l'ivtI Albany runners were all hiin
enough to gain a win but a drive
by the fifth runner would clinch
victory.

After the fourth mile mark,
Pfeifl'er was well enough in the
lead but the other Cortland
runners could not keep up with
the fast pace. As they faded, it
was obvious that Albany was
going to win. Vinnie lteda and
Jim Shrader were side by side
battling for second. Both were
easily in front of the fourth
place runner. Bill Snrel, Nick
DeMarco, and Carlo Cherubino
were all in the top twenty and
the team battle was for second
between Cortland and Gcncsco.

Pfcil'fer easily won the race
finishing in 25:40.4 which was
the ninth fastest time ever on
the Albany course. Vinnie Reda
opened up a little to beat out

Shrader. Vinnie was clocked in
25:54.0 with Shrader 4.5
seconds behind. Reda's time was
the third fastest ever turned in
by an Albany runner. Shrader
was aiming to break the 26
minute mark and did so by 1.5
seconds.

Bill Sorel ran a steady race and
finished seventh. Nick Dob/lat mo,
running hurt, struggled in tenth.
Carlo Cherubino finished 18th
to insure victory. John Koch put
on a great performance after
falling down to finish twenty
fourth. Scott Abercrombic
finished 27th. It was Koch and
Abercrombie who insured vic
tory by finishing ahead of three
Cortland and three Genesco
runners.

Homecoming Day featured an
alumni hospitality tent which
offered all sorts of food and
drink.

After Saturday's 13-13 tie with
Brockport, Coach Bob Ford and
the football team might want to
visit a similar place.

For it will probably take more
than a few beers to help them
forget the numerous and costly
mistakes committed by the club
in the contest.

The opening kickoff saw big
Jim Holloway boot the ball
down to Brockport‘s 15 yard
line where it landed out of
bounds.

However. a penalty forced Al-
bany to kick over. This time
Holloway got off a short kick
and the ball bounced back to the
‘15.

This set off what seemed to be
a continuous string of mistasz
for the Great Danes.

The Eagles were unable to ca-
pitalize on the good field posi»
tion, though, and were forced to

\

 

\

‘“""sia.spy“c;saag

punt. Albany received the ball
on their own seven.

After the Danes got off only
two plays, McCoy Allister fum-
bled and Brockport recovered on
the Albany 15. Three plays later,
the Eagles were on the score-
board.

The kick was good and Brock-
port had quickly grabbed a 7-0
lead.

Then came another stroke of
misfortune for the Danes. Brock-
port tried a flat kick which
appeared to be an onsides kick
but actually wasn't.

The ball popped into the air,
the wind cut it down just be-
yond 10 yards, and a Brockport
defender jumped on the ball.
Once again the Albany defense
provided the heroics and Brock-
port was unable to pick up much
yardage.

It was then time for Brockport
to punt and for Albany to make
another mistake.

Noel Walker got a hand on the
ball but couldn‘t hold on and
Brockport gained possession.
The Danes' defensive squad
halted another threat by the
Eagles by holding them on the
three yard line.

When the Albany Gridders
took over, John Bertuzzi and
McCoy Allister went to work to
give the Danes some operating
room.

On the next play. Marvin Perry
spotted a hole and raced ahead
for an 82 yard gain. Unfor-
tunately, Perry fell and was pre-
vented t'rom going all the way.

Noel Walker scored Albany‘s
first touchdown of the game
four plays later. Mark Fuller
kicked the PAT to tie up the
game.

The tie didn't hold up for long,
though.

Shortly before the end of the
first quarter. Brockport‘s Dave
'l‘urkow broke through State's
offensive line, snatched a lateral.
and ran unmolestcd for a touch-
down. The conversion kick
soared wide to the right.

In the second quarter, the
Eagles mounted a strong drive.
But Bruce Cummings inter—
cepted a Dennis Roslowski pass
on the two to stop Brockport
from scoring again.

Albany could get no farther
than the 43 yard line on the nut
series of plays, however.

Several fumbles killed a num-
ber of Albany drives during the
period and Brockport enjoyed a
13-7 halftime lead.

Third period action saw Al-
bany march 69 yards in eight
plays for a touchdown. Carvin
Payne took the ball in for the
Danes. Mark Fuller’s kick was no
good.

More fumbles and an inter‘
cepted Bertuzzi pass thwarted
the Danes‘ chances for addi-
tional scoring.

With Just over a minute left in
the game, it appeared that Al-
buny might be able to pull offa
victory. But Carvin Payne fum-
bled on the 20 and the Great
Danes had to settle for the 13-13
tie.

All in all, Albany was lucky to
salvage a tie. The Gridders lost
seven of ten fumbles and suf-
fered two crucial interceptions.
The Albany defense showed the
pulse they’ve become famous for
in preventing Brockport from
blowing the game wide open.

Marvin l’crry (lid his best in the
quest for a victory. Perry racked
up 1‘.” rushing yards in just 15
