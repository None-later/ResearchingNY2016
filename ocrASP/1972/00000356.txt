Strike Truce Called;

Towing Banned

All indications are that the Student Association Parking Strike was
a success. Strike leaders met with several administrators Wednesday
morning in an attempt to reach some sort of agreement on parking

regulations.

What came out of the meeting was a decision to stop all towing of
cars until the recently approvad new Parking Regulations 90 into
13th. Meanwhile, a newly created joint

effect on November

committee of the Student Affairs Council and the University
Community Council will negotiate on the two major parking
grievances: parking on the gravel areas and segregation in the train

lots.

What this means is that until new provisions are decided on, or by
November 13th (whichever comes first), students will be allowed to
park in any legitimate space on campus. Both Campus Security and
Central Council will enforce “no parking" regulations in certain

“safety zones."

50 open parking, the main objective of the strike, is now a reality

Bureaucracy, Apathy

News Ailuhni'ix
by Al SL’IIIﬂ

There are two ways to look at
everything III SUNYA. The first
is to see wlittl is apparent. The
second is to see what its really
there.

So it is with the promotion
and tenure system. What seems
apparent is an eluburete struc-
ture designed to provide faculty
and student. evuluution of the
merits of individuul professors
and puss judgment on their per-
formunct‘.

But whut is really there is u
I'ltiwed bureaucratic system, It
system thul pieces greiit amounts
of powur in the hitndh‘ of u few
illld gent-rally excludes students
from hirving much more than it
token any on the quality of the
education for which they pay.

pt)W('l’5-Lllul.'lli‘ have apparently
decided that filling out teacher

most systematic, and most quuli-
LitIth‘ method.

Student power is further dl'
minishvd by denying students

History Depurtment. for exam-
ple, did so julit recenLly.

don’t lIaVe executive committees

The only comprehensive study
on the matter was the Rothmun
Report. II study lotus-d in Febru-
ary of 197] by the Central
Council's Acudemie Affairs
Commission. The twenty-one
puge report concluded: “In
summury, student participation
varies in each department. In
some as the natural sciences...the
students tire very active and have
much influenco on department
policy. In others such as the
lt.P.A. department, they can't
