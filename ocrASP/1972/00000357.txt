The reaction of department
chairmen to the writing of the
report is also interesting Some
provided the students with de-
tailed explanations of their de-
partmental structure and the
role students played in it. Others
reacted negatively. The report
has this to say about the astron-
omy department: “They did not
wish to answer. All they said is
that this school has too many
bureaucratic committees ﬁnding
overlapping information...and
the university would be better
off without so many of them"

The Geography Department
chairman was even more abrupt.
In the words of the report: "The

FRIDAY OC'l C‘bi' 3'

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by Glenn von Nootltz

The odd thing about Richard
Gaocoyne in that he seem- so
nonchalant. He's been an Ania-
tant Professor of Classics here
since 1969 and was up for
tenure review earlier this year.
He received positive recommen-
dations from fellow faculty
members and the department
chairman, and he is very popular
among his students.

Yet the University still denied
him tenure. And although he
doesn‘t have another job lined
up yet and has a family to
support, he doesn’t seem parti-
cularly worried. He just seems to
accept his fate, and fate has been
rather cruel this year to Pro-
fessor Gascoyne.

The whole Gascoync story
contains many of the problems
inherent in the tenure system no
it operates at this University.
There is the often alleged lack of
student inﬂuence in determining
which professors should be ﬁred
or promoted. Who, students ask,
should make the ultimate de—
cision? A Dean, reclining in his
carpeted office? A committee of
faculty members? Or should the
students, the people most
directly affected by the tenure
system (beside the Faculty mem-
ber), make the ultimate de-
cisions?

And there is the problem of
what many obseerrs term a
“cold” and “impersonal” system
which grinds on with little re-
gard for human feeling or
emotion.

“No PILD. r w Slash"

The reason why Gascoyne
won‘t be teaching here next year
seems simple on the surface. He
doesn't last long here at
SUNYA, no matter how good he
may be or how wellvliked. Com-
ments Gascoyne: "No PhD . . .
slash. you‘re through."

He completed all his doctoral
course work at Columbia and
has begun work on his disserta-
Linn. But even the fact that ho is
rapidly nearing the completion
of his doctoral work didn't seem
to have much effect on Lllt‘
tenure di-cision-makcrs,

 

Criteria

Faculty members all receive a
copy of the “Faculty Hand-
book” which, among other
things, eiplaina University
policies in regard to continuing
appointment, tenure, and pro-
motion. The handbook liata five
criteria for determining an in-
atmotor's ﬁtness for appoint-
ment, tenure or promotion.

Fiist of all, the instructor is
supposed to show “mastery of
subject matter.” The book
doesn't go into much depth ex-
plaining what this means, but if
his testimonials are to be be
lievcd, Gascoyne certainly ful-
ﬁlls the qualifications in this
area. One of his professors at

 

’nio tenure decilion-makm
also uk about the candidate'-
“Ihillty as a scholar," “effect-
veneu of university lervice,”
and what they term “continuing
growth." In all of these areas,
Gucoyne'a Departmental Re-
commendation gave him very
high marks. Former professors
of Gascoyne'a were quoted as
having “outstanding experi-
ences" with him an an under-
graduate. He was cd-director of
Classics Weekend on campus in
1970. He is a member of a
plethora of professional associa-
tions, and was Vice-President of
the Eastern Zone of the Latin
Teachers Association. His con-
tinuing growth was exempliﬁed

The Guscoyne Affair:

 

uh Humborger, “why should it
be recon-ldared?"

Humbergor did any that the
decision to release Glacoyne has
made “essentially on hil own
merits." But he later pointed out
that there was at least one ex-
traneous factor which inﬂuenced
the decision making. If Gas-
coyne were to be tenured, the
result would be a 100% tenured
Classics Department, which,
according to Hunsberger, would
seriously reduce ﬂexibility. Once
an instructor is given tenure he
can be fired only under very
grave circumstances. According
to Humberger, “tenure in not
something to be considered
lightly."

The amount of student Input
into the tenure decision process
hu become a subject of some
controversy, not only with the
Gaacoyne can, but with the
tenure cases of Do. Caroline
Waterman of the Psychology
Department and History Pro-
fessor David Goodman as well.
The Arts and Sciences Commit-
tee has six members in addition
to Dean Humberger. There are
presently no students on the
committee.

Whether the inclusion of stu-
dents on the committee would
have affected the ﬁnal outcome
of the Cascoyne case is uncer-
tain. All of Gaacoyne’a student
evaluations were highly favor-

"Only On Paper I Failed"

Columbia has said, “He is now a
thoroughly equipped young
classicist whom I would trust
teaching on any level short of
the doctoral seminar.” And the
former Classics Department
chairman claimed that, “Mr.
Gascoyne is decidedly superior."

The handbook also lists “effec~
tiveness at teaching” as an im-
portant criteria. in this area,
Gascoync’s proof of competency
are the highly enthusiastic rc-
commcndzitions filled out by his
students. Of 104 qucstionnaircs
completed, all of the students
thought Gascoyne had “excel-
lent mastery" of his subject
matter, 103 thought that he
"organized the course well" and
102 found that his lectures were
“interesting and stimulating." in
addition to Lhcsc recommendir
tions were unsolicited student
testimonials, including lcttcrs
supporting Gascoync in his

tenure struggle,

and respected among students, fellow faculty members,

and the department chairman. 'l‘lic iio—tciiurc decision was

by his work toward advanced
degrees.

The Classics department facul-
ty voted unanimously to re-
commend Gnscoyne for tenure.

It is quite clear to all that
Gascoync did very well in all of
the criteria. But the fact is that
he does not yet haVe his doc-
torate. As he told this reporter,
“Either you have it or you
don't,“ Unfortunately for Gas-
ciiyiw, he still doesn’t have it.

Another Reason

The case isn't all that simple,
however. According to Ruth
Schmidt, Associate Dean for
Humanities, there was at least
one other reason why Gascuyne
wasn't rcliired. She cites a “de‘
creasing interest in Latin und
(,Ilussicul Studies."

Gascoyne is quick to point
out, however, that although the
number of students majoring in
Classics has declined somewhat,
the number of students taking
courses- in the Classics Depart-
ment has doubled during the
past three years. And it has been

Of course, the argument iii not
all one-sided. There are men like

the Collage of Arts und Sciences.
He doesn't find anything wrong
in the Guacoyne decision at ull;
the decision doesn't seem at ull
unusual to llllll. “Reconsider?”

Hunaberger doesn't seem to
feel that the tenure system is
particularly cold or impersonal.
He rather glibly justifies the way
it functions, saying that, “Any
organization is forced to make
personnel decisions, and if the
individual is not given tenure,
he’s not likely to feel very warm
about it." He dl’iIWB an analogy
between a university and "in-
dustry," saying that there is
“more consultation" with the
employee in ii uniVersity than in
industry.

able, and it has been suggesteo
that student members of the
committee would be more likely
to listen to their peers than
would faculty members.
The Tenure Machine
Apparently, then, the dc—
cisicn-makers found the re-
commendations from faculty
members, the student evalua-
tions, and university service of
less importance than Gascoyne’s
lack of a Ph.D and the inﬂexi-
bility that would result from a
100% tenured department.
