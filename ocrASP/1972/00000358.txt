Washington Al’ — Presidential
aide Henry A. Kissinger said
Thursday “peace is at hand" in
Vietnam and, in his View, can be
achieved in three or four days of
private diplomacy.

The Saigon government, how
ever, remained a principal stum-
bling block, stating that the
South Vietnamese could not be
bound by any North Vietnam»
U.S. agreement.

“to participate in the making of
their own peace."

In summation, the President‘s
key foreign policy aide gave the
view that 'I'hieu would ultimate-

Kissinger said there need not
be a long delay that remaining
difficulties could be settled in
one more, negotiating session
“lat-ting no more than three or
four days."

In Paris, where another round
of formal peace discussions Were
held Wednesday, the North Viet

otherwise, if the 01-1 Ill dead-

question, said he could not con.
ceive that llanoi would seize
upon such grounds to scuttle
peace efforts that have come so
close to fruitation.

"We believe," he said, “that by
far the longest part of the road
has been traversed and what
stands in the way of an agree-
ment now are issues that are
relatively less important than
those that have already been
settled."

Saigon radio emphasized that
South Vietnam would not be
bound by any agreement but (lid
not indicate whether Saigon
would oppose it.

"We in South Vietnam have
the right of sett'~determination,"
the broadcast said, “A separate
agreement between North Viet-
nam and the United States does
not concern us in any way."

In the Wake

by Holger Jensen

Associated Press Writer

Hanoi talked peace Thursday,
but: ordered its forces to con-
tinue fighting until the United
States signs a cease-ﬁre agree-
ment worked out. in secret.

North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong troops responded with in-
tensified shelling, small-unit
ground attacks and terrorist in-
cidents in South Vietnam.

South Vietnamese head-
quarters reported 113 enemy-
inintinted incidents, including 81
shelling attacks, in the past 24
hours.

The Saigon command said it
was the largest number of at.-
lacks in any 24-hour period
since the 'I‘ct offensive of 1968
but U.S. sources said they were
of “no military significance since
most consisted of only one or
two rocket and mortar rounds.

A Viet Cong document cap-
tured in Da Naiig indicated the
stepped up attacks would con-
tinue for the next two days, and
U.S. troops in the northern port
city Were placed on heightened
alert.

The newspaper 'l‘in Song, con-
trolled iiy the presidential
palace, said President Nguyen
Van 'l'hieu ordered the comman-
ders of all four militiiry regions
to crush any enemy attempts to
create “a general uprising."

bodia, the high command in

of the capital, at noon. A
spokesman, Col. Am Rona, said
the enemy fled during the night:
as the Cambodian column began
an advance from Kompeng Speu,
25 miles southwest of Phnom
Penh.

The U.S. Command announced
the deactivation of 19 Army and
Air Force support units and the
resumed withdrawal of an A37
jet squadron that was delayed by
enemy activity around Saigon.

The total was 1,210 men,
mostly postal, supply, signal,
transportation and medical de-
tachments. The withdrawals
lowered U.S. military strength in
Vietnam to less than 33,000
men. President Nixon has set a
goal of 27,000 men by Dec. 1.

The U.S. Command also an—
nounced no Americans were
killed in action last week, the
second week in the past five that
no combat deaths were reported.

The South Vietnamese com-
mand reported 580 of its own
troops and 2,785 of the enemy
killed last week, the highest
totals in ii month. Saigon said
2,075 government troops were
wounded and 146 were missing.

The allied commands now have
reported these casualties for the
war: Americaniilﬁﬁdd killed in
action; Iltlil,xt75-wounded,
10,281-dead of nonhostilc
causes and 1,699 missing or cup-

was near.

Donald Johnson, U.S. admini-
striitor for verterans' affairs, said
in has Vegas that 'l'hursdiiy's
announcement "does show the
negotiations liiiVe borne fruit
and that Hanoi has indeed now

One woman leaving the cathe-
dral earlier said she found the
news hard to believe. "It seems
so sudden because the Wiir has
almost become it way of life,"
she said.

Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked
the Pentagon Papers to the press,
said in Ithaca, N.Y., that the
news of the proposed settlement
was “a tribute to the American
people and the antiwar move-
ment." He added: “It definitely
looks like the President is about
to agree to the settlement North
Vietnam has proposed since he
has been in office."
