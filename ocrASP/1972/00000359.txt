Pulitzer Prize Winner Says

“Shriver a Truly Civilized Man”

by William Styron

I suppose it is a vain, yet
irresistible, lantasy on the
part of American writers
and artists to think that our
political leaders might be
interested in or he in the
slightest way iriiluericed by
their works.

Yet, I iind it a wintth
and strange lact that Sat»
gent Shiiver is trtily cori—
ceined with intellectual
matters, and the trope it
gives me lor a|l ol us is
derived iiorii personal ex»
perreiice.

()n a morning in lilol, l
was awakened at about
litill) (I am a late sleeper)
by a pleasarrl lertiale voice,
who told the sire was calling
from the ()l () rrr Washing
ton, and that Sargent
Shriver was on the line, It
was not a call lroiii a total
stranger, I had met Sarge
when john F. Kennedy was
President and since those
years my wife and I had
spent iriore than one plea~
sarit evening with him and
the tarnin 'sarge came tight
to the poriii, and that vi-
brant, enthusiastic voice
quickly buoyed rrre rip out

oi my slumber, just the
night before, he said, he had
read the 40,000—-word ex—
cerpt from my nt,.e|, “The
Coriiessions oi Nat turner,"
which had been published
in the current issue oi Har-
per's Maga/ine. All writers
like praise and Sarge's praise
for tiiy work was generous,
to say the least. But it was
not simple ilattery, it was
praise iriiorrried by the
deepest and rriost sensitive
understanding ol the iriipli»
cations of the hook. it may
be terrrembered that at that
time our racial crisis was at
its rrrost lioiriiying and ex~
plosive, with death tires in
the cities. Sarge's leelirig lot
the historic parallels be-
tween the contertrporaty
holocaust arid riiy own
work was both subtle and
penetrating augmented, I
might add, by that truly
rertrarkahle curiosity I have
come to connect veith the
Sargent Shtiver manner.
What about my accountoi
Nat Turner's actual revolt?
He loved the excerpt, he
said, but what about the
rest of the book! His rippe-
tite had only been whettcd

tor the entire story.
Wouldn't I please send him
a copy of the iinished hook

or copies rather : he
wanted to distribute the
novel to his stall and other
associates so that they too
might he as illtiriiiriated and
as moved as he had been,

Save lor my editor
and publisher and one or
two close irrerrds, it had
been the lust reaction to
Nat lrirrier that I had re
cerved and I need not say
that l was exhilaraied.

lhis little anecdote may

seem to rise out oi a sortie
what excessive seit pie
occupation, and might not
tell riiricli riiore than we
already know about the
exuberant, questing riiarr
who tirade the phone call.
But, in retrospect, that hriel
contact seems to have risen
ironi an almost miraculous-
ly sane and decent impulse,
one that has been shared in
America by very lew rireri
oi such inﬂuence and
power. It was the gesture of
a civilized mart in all the
truly valuable and honored
meanings of that term.
