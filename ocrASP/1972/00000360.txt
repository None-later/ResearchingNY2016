to be a series of Midnight Shows.
The Friday Midnight 'Show will
be a little known_ film by
Jacques Tourneur titled, The Co-
medy of Terrors. The Saturday
Midnight Show will be the re-
cent thriller, Wait Until Dark.

The Comedy of Terrors is just
that; a black comedy dealing
with two New England morti-
cians at the turn of the century
who, whenever business slacks
off, go out and kill people in
order to keep their financial
heads above water. One couldn't
ask for a more fitting cast: Vin-
cent Price and Peter Lorre as the
two Iindertakui’s, Boris Karloff
its the senile senior partner of
lhe firm, illld Basil Rathbone as
the much righteous holder of the
mortgage on Price and Lorri-‘5
little business, Add to this char-
iicter actress Joyce Jameson as
Price‘s wife and an appearance
by Joe E. Brown as a most
unlikely cemetery keeper and
you have one of the most charm-
ing spoofs of the horror genre
you could hope for.

Tourneur, who worked with
Viil Lowton in the forties to
make such fine examples of
subtle horror a); The Cat People.
directed the film from a script
by veteran fantasy writer Richv
zird Matheson whose credits in-
clude The Incredible Shrinking
