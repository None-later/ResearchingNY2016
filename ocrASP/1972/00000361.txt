Yehuda Hanani, the most. re-
cent addition to our illustrious
music faculty, has been des-
cribed as many things. Leonard
Rose (one of the three lope
cellists in the world) called him
“an absolutely first-rate cello tal-
ent, potentially one of the
wodd’s great cellists." The great
musicians of the world have
flocked to praise him, the critics
have given him almost unani-
mously rave reviews, yet he,
himself, is a modest, soft-spoked
man of great personal charm. He
has little of the overbearing ego
tism which sometimes mars the
world's great masters. '

The first question one asks is
why such an accomplished man
is teaching here, at a small,
budding music department? I
like the atmosphere," he states,
“There is none of that 'Conser-
vatory’ presure. It is easy to

learn and to teach here.‘ But,

then, what of the monetary as-
pect? Surely you could make
more money as a touring solmst!

You must have been offered a

rather attractive salary.

“Actually, it‘s not that fan-

tastic. You know, I'm really a

lousy businessman." He must be

Young View of Washington

The Old Nixon

WASHINGTON—The “Old
Nixon” surfaced for a few mom-
ents the other day when the
President addressed a gathering
here in Washington of families of
prisoners of war.

On the spur of the moment
Mr. Nixon decided to replace the
scheduled speaker, his chief for-
eign policy advisor Dr, Henry A.
Kissinger. Apparently the sub-
stitution was made so hastily
that even the Secret Service did
not have time to do their normal
advance work.

Certainly, precious little ad-
vance thought went into the
President’s eight-minute cxtem-
poraneous speech, for he took
the opportunity once again to
launch a needless attack on cri-
tics of his Victnnm policy, those
editors, commentators, business-
men, and others who opposed
the Us mining of North Vietr
mimcse harbors. Hc asserted that
these opinion lendch gave him
“precious little support,H adding
that “The most heartwarming
thing to mc was that those who
had so much at stake, lhosc who
had suffci'cd so much, the grcat
majority of lhosc whose hus-
bands and lovcd ones are POWs
or MlAs, stood by that dccision,
and I thank you vcry much."

All in all, the pcrformancc was
ncgativc and dcfcnsivc, not tho
sort of spcccli which might legit-
imately be cxpci‘iL-(l from an
incumbent (Ihicf EXI-culivc who
holds an liiiprccctlcnlcd 2d per-
centage poiiil lcad over his oppo-
ncnt with less than n month 1ch
before election day.

He also took thc opportunity
to press his hard lini- against mcn
who avoidcd Viciiium duty, say~
ing that “lhosv who have dcscrl-
cd America will pay ii price for

jack anderson

their choice.” He did not elabo-
rate on what he has in mind, but
any way you cut it, the policy
does not sound like one calcu-
lated to bring together a nation
deeply split, as it has been for
years, over a war nobody under-
stands.

For once in his life, indeed
perhaps the first time, Mr. Nixon
does not have to worry about
playing the role of the underdog.
His lead is so wide there should
be no need for bitterness toward
any of those who, rightly or
wrongly, but nonetheless sin~
ccrcly disagreed with his poli-
cies. In fact, if the lead proves to
herald a victory of the magni-
tudc now being predicted, the
President will hiivc a rare oppor-
tunity to do cxnclly what he has
said many times is his drcam « to
bring us togelhcr He would do
Wcll to concentrate now on his
plans for making that drczim a
rcalily

Unfortunately. political vic-
torics of such wide margins havv
provcii to l)c niixcd blessings,
both for lllt‘ Victor.» and lhc
country, It was on llll' hccls of
such a victory that l’rcsidcni

trary

Should Mr. Nixon rcccirc ii
conipnrnblc majority, we can
only hopc that he will rcalixc
that the vote in 1972, as it did in
1964, rcl'lcctcd mori- doubt
about thc nltcrnntiyc than con-
l'idcncc in llic incumbcnl. Sad to
say, that bopc is morc fcrvcnt
than rcnlistic, as his ri-marks to
the POW familics only too well
attest.

Washington Merry-Go-Hound

McGovern’s Used Car

Washington Dcmocriits once
again are dredging up tlic old
familiar question about Richard
Nixon. l’oliticnl posters arc ask-
ing votcrs: “Would you buy it
used car from this man?"

The question is cspci‘inlly un-
fair in this political campaign,
since George McGovurn actually
has bad morc cxpcricncc in deal»
ing with uscd cars.

The IRS, hows-var, found noth~
ing incriminating.

Senator McGchrn himself has
discussed the transaction frankly
Willi us. He called the money llt.‘

The deal was all pcrfcclly legal,
but it does provide a new twist
on an old question. A Republi-

suggestions seriously. The prin-
cess and I realize that you must
realize this progressive penal
colony, which some have the gall
to call a university, is supposedly
full of ideal American students,
with high lQ's, cultured back-
grounds, and grade point ave-
rages of 92% or better. Dealing
with people of this nature, in
your suggested manner, would
be useless since they are apa-
thetic, mindless, little creatures,
most of whom don‘t give a damn
about what some cocksucking
queer does, since this is a free
country, (Example, the cartoon
in Tuesday's ASP). Meanwhile
the rest of the lost souls are
determined to forget the revoluv
lionary spirit we once had, and
follow McGovern into the vallcy

Perhaps, in the future, women
will bc so liberated from the
prisons of their bodies tlial abor-
tions will become an outdated
issue. Contraceptives that are
100% effective have ycl to he
devoloped. Different methods of
artifical inscmenation and pre-
nutal growth in vitro could pro-
vide that ultimate liberation,
However, both advances in tech
nology and changes in attitude
will have to occur before those
opportunities become available
and those ideas accepted.

In conclusion, I SCL’ my bio.
logical function as the strongest
force oppressing me. thn I no
longer have to worry about the
personal sacrifices I will have to
make for the preservation of the
species then I will be satisfied.
Until then I see any means to
bring me closer to that goal as
not merely a possible alternative
but as one of my fundamental
rights.
