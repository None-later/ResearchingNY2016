"Truckers Favorites "

by Greg Shaw

Alternative Features Service

Commander Cody may be on
his way to stardom—in demand
all over the college and concert
circuit, worshipped in Europe
and heard round the world-but
his music has yet to lose any of
its small club, sswdust-snd-beer
quality.

If it did, of course, there
wouldn't be much left. Com-
mander Cody is the band that
took country music out of the
hands of the Laurel Canyon
dilettsntes, giving young folks
their first glimpse of the real
bulls and innate honesty in that
kind of music—and even did the
same for those Country &
Western fans lucky enough to
give them it try. But today‘s C it:
W is as for removed from its
roots as rock is, and u lot of
people don't realize how ruw it
used to be.

Asleep At The Wheel (recently
signed to United Artsts) is it new
outﬁt which is following in
Cody's footsteps and seems des-
tined to revolutionize country
music, but Cody is still the only

group in the world playing rock
& roll the way it sounded back
in 1955 when young Southern
country musicians were experi-
menting with the beginnings of
white rock & roll. For that
reason I wish they had more
songs like “Boppin‘ the Blues,"
"Good Rockin’ Tonight" and
“Git 1t," instead of less effective
Little Richard oldies, but a
whole album of rockabilly will
undoubtedly be forthcoming
and anyway, Hot Licks. Cold
Steel (1‘: ’I‘ruckc' Favorites (Para-
mount 6031) is lrendy a theme
nlbum of sorts.

If the title doesn't give it away,
the portrait of a gi int semi truck
on the cover and the lovely
cutouts on the buck—like one of
those old King truck-driving ill-
bums—is u sure tipoff. Truck
songs always had more vitality
than the rest of country music,
nnd this is largely a collection of
Cody's trucking favorites.

Real truck music is usually
sung by guys with it deep-
throuted Paul Bunyan kind of

voice, but when Billy (3. steps to

Drivin' Man” in his best Gene
Vincent tones, the result is is
fantastic and impossible com-
bination of styles. It’s a blend
which reaches the ultimate in
“Truck Stop Rock," which
could not have existed before
Cody but sounds right out of
some old Memphis jukebox.

There are three more trucking
songs on this album, including
the classic “Mama Hated Die-
sels.” it's one of those slow,
mournful, cryin’-in-your-beer
numbers, telling the story of a
family where both the father,
and later the fatherless son, gave
their lives to the big rigs, leaving
the poor brave lady in the mid-
rlle to crack from the pressure. If
this one gets heard in Nashville,
it‘ll turn a few heads.

Besides the diesel ditties and
two little Richard numbers,

'l‘ruclirrs Favorites is notable for
a lovely country song called
“Kentucky Hills of Tennessee,"
a moody rocker titled “Watch
my .38," and u really fine ver-
sion of the old Cajun tune,
“Diggy Liggy Lo." To top it all,
(Jody himself makes it nppenrnce
at the mike to sing "It Should've
Been Me." This curly '50's R 8:
B standard has never sounded
better, and it could be the hit to
follow “Hot ltod Lincoln."

Since 1 first saw them, l'vc
lwt‘n trying to curb my impulse
to over-analyze the significance
ol' Cody's sensational popularity.
To me, they're like a glimpso
into the reality of that 1955
’I‘ennessee roudhousc my mind
has conjured up over the years
whenever i heard one. of those
fini- old Southem rock records.
But the kids who buy Cody‘s
records most likely never heard
of Carl Perkins, and the only
explanation is that the old
rock& roll style really does have
thi- intrinsic irresistability I've
always believed it to possess. It‘s
niCl' to be vindicated, and it's
even better to have this kind of
music around again. Long liVe
rock & roll!
