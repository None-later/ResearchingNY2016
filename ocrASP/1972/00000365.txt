Promotion, Tenure Examined; Weaknesses Revealed

Continued from page two

But President Benezet en-
dorsed the report writing in a
position statement on June 20th
in which he stated: “In general,
both promotion and tenure
should be increasingly the re-
sponsibility of departments or
Schools. Recommendations up
the line which go past the Deans’
level should become increasingly
procedural and less substantive;
that is the pattern found in
mature university faculties." He
said reducing the University
Council’s role “was justified"
and that students and junior
faculty should play an undefined
"appropriate role."

Sirotkin continued: “In my
judgement, the recommenda-
tions constitute a measurable
improvement of our existing
procedures.” Students, however,
were not quite as thrilled with
the change. Lampert pledged to
battle the bill strenously on the
Senate floor if it was ever re-
leased for action.

But it never was. Instead. the
Executive Committee of the
Senate decided the plan was not
sufﬁciently “action-oriented,"
and it was tossed to a new
subcommittee for rewriting.

This second subcommittee re-
port as rewritten was released to

  

I. Moyer Hunsberger. Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences,

'l'hus Bent-rel kept his promise
of “reform” but at the same
time did not alienate powerful
faculty, deans and department
chairmen. Extent of sludenl in
I’ltl\‘l‘llll'l1l would have depended
on how one defined “appm
prune."

Vice President l’hilip Sinitkin

But the greatest fault of the
promotion and tenure system is
not that the department chair-
men and dean exercise an undue
amount of power in the differing
levels of bureaucracy; or that the
system neglects to bother with
significant student opinion,
though established bylaws recog-
nize its worth; or that promised
reform is at worst, retrogression,
and at best, maintenance of the
status quo.

The greatest fault is that guide-
lines guaranteeing students a
significant role in the entire
system have been written, dis-
cussed and adopted by the
Senate - and are virtually ig-
mired.

A little known report called
“lteport of Ad-Hoc Faculty-
Sludent Consultation Guidelines
Committee" was drawn up be-
ginning in the Spring of 1969
and released in December of that
year. The group was chaired by
Virgil Zimmerman and has some
rather interesting statements to
make about faculty-student
interaction in lhe promotion and
tenure procedure.

lls philosophy is mirrored in
the goal thal “students and
faculty together Wlll guide the
course and shape the destiny of
thc uiiiversily.”

lts nuggeslions, according to
the preamble of the report will
help the uniw-rsity community
carry out ii declaration of policy
passed earlier in lllli‘.) by lhe
Senate, a declaration lliat ill"
firmed “students are l'lllllll'li to
be consulted and their opinions
and desires Weighed In the for~
mation of decisions on academic

matters.
The report does iiol mandate It

uniform policy for student con-
sultation, but does giVe indi-
academic departments
“primary responsibility" for
drawing up a statement of
policies and procedures and
passing on the statement to the
Vice-(fliiiirman of the Senate.
'l'hc statement will, in the words
of the report, “make cxphcil the
circumstances and manner in
which student opinion will be
obtained, the Stllill’t‘l matters
scheduled for discussion, the
machinery to be employed for
selection of student rcpresenta
tivr-s, the greviaiice procedure
and such other procedures iis
may :ipproprizilcly be made ii
iiiiiller of record."

v idual

Specifically, the policy “as
sures" adequate Hl udi-nl
Department consultation
llirtiugh meetings and says “re.

presentative students may be
included" in faculty meetings
and committees. It states formal
student organizations "may"
meet occasionally with faculty
officers and committees and that
joint faculty and student coun-
cils responsible for matters of
mutual concern "might" be esta-
blished. It states matters of our-

riculum, appointment, promo—
tion, degree requirements,
course scheduling, grading,

library and laboratory policies
and teaching methods and pro-
cedures are legitimate student
areas of interest and that their
opinion “should be solicited." It
even bucks a student greviance
procedure “to assure justice
through a fact finding and medi-
ation."

And finally, it states the fol-
lowing in section 7: “Elemental
notions of ‘due process' dictate
that students be advised of the
policies and procedures which
have been adopted to assure
them the opportunity to be con-

sulted on matters of concern to
them and the right to impartial
consideration of petitions for
the redress of greviances."

In other words, it states that it
is the obligation of each depart—
ment to inform students of that
report and the existing depart-
mental structure. But few stu-
dents have ever heard of it.

Benezet has been given the
report at least twice and, accor-
ding to Lampert, “his reaction
has usually been silence."

So the potential poWer remains
unused, largely ignored since the
day it was granted, thanks to ii
combination of departmental
and administrative inaction
coupled with student ignorance
and apathy, lt is just this sort of
lethal combination that has let
the system continue as it is,
largely unknown, a matter for
student concern only when
popular faculty are eased out of
nontcnured positions.

This reporter was extremely
impressed with what I saw and
heard at the outing club meeting
I attended Wednesday night. Be-
fore tonight I had never heard of
them and after the meeting I had
wished I had, The entire set up
of the club is very informal;
when I asked the president of
the club who could be a member
of ()uting Club, he responded,
“Everyone is a memlii-i of out
ing club." This refers to the fact
that the club, likc many other
organizations of this campus, is
funded liy the Mandatory Stu-
dent lax...lle indirectly is invi~
ling anyone who is interested in
llie club to allcnd and take part

As the name implies, the out
mg club has to do willi the
outdoors Basically the club
plans trips to different recrea
liuiizil zii‘cs of HIV Northeast,
including areas of the nearby
Adirondacks, Vermont and New
Hampshire, just to name a few
(For various lengths of time -
weekciids, a flernoon, even week

Bacters Surprise Hawks

With 0-0 Tie

by Nathan Salant

When New Paltz came to town
Wednesday they expected an-
other easy win in what was to be
their march to the SUNY cham-
pionship. They were confident.
The Danes came in with a 1-7
record and the Hawks let A]-
bany’s hooters know it with
some pre-game taunting. When
the game was over, it was the
Danes who were confident. The
game had ended in a surprising
0—0 tie, and so had New Paltz‘s
title bid.

The Danes' play was superb.
John '1‘hayer had his first great
game in the net this year. Larry
Herzog continued his march to
All State and possibly All Ameri
can rating. Mark Solano starred
at the left fullback spot, and
Cliff Walzer turned in another
superb performance out on the
wing. ('oach Wingert said aftcr
wards, “Everyone played a great
game. I can’t nameonc particular
guy who was outstanding, We
simply looked great out there
against the number two SUNY
ll'illn.

One man did stand out in my
opinion because he savr-d lhe

dismal for the Great Danes' fans,
when suddenly, from no place,
supposedly slow Leon Sedefian
came leaping across the net just.
in time to kick the ball away. To
quote Coach Wingert, "Sedeﬁari
has the potential to be a great
player next year. He’s a superior
ball handler, and at his best on
defense. We'll probably drop
him back to the fullback posi-
tion, and with a little more
speed, he could be all SUNY
next year,"

(Ihalk a good game up for the
refs. They made a good call that
could hare won the game for
Albany. A shot was taken, hit
the crossbar, bounced straight
down, and was then battled out
by the Hawks goalie. 'l'WIcc this
year, the Danes bad goals scored
against us on lhis lype of play.
In both cases, the refs were out
of position, but gavethohnme
team :I gonl.’l‘his time the ref did
not signal goal an excellent,
although unfortunate call for
Albany.

Early in the game, George
Kelcsliiiiii was robbed of .I goal

shian might have had a serious
effect on the game, but fortu-
nately Albany lone injury ,short'
of having to put their substitute
goalie into the game.

Minor injuries have constantly
plagued the Danes all year.
Bruce Michaels, starting sweeper-
bnck, re-injured his knee, and

cht, Jubcrt hurt his let and also
took a seat. When Gregg Mc—
Millan was floored by a kick in
the knee, the Danes were down
to a total bench strength of our
sub‘goulie, Steve Carlson.

'l'his was a really big game for
the Danes. New Paltz is a vastly
superior lcam when compared to
our competition in next week-
end's tournament. Now, there's
more than hope for a Dane
sweep of the tournament. This
game has lifted ii sagging morale,
and may be the lzig lift the
hooters needed all year.
