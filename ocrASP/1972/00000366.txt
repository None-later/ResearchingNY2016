The Albany cross-country
team was beaten soundly by a
great Colgate team in Colgate,
last Wednesday. The 39-20 loss
was only Albany’s second duel
meet loss this year; Albany's
record is now 10—2.

Colgate, one of the top teams
in the State, went out to blow
Albany off the course and suc-
ceeded. Five Colgate runners
went out in mass and only Jim
Shrader was able to run ‘with
them.

' hrader put on an Outstanding
performance battling' ur‘lder‘the
pressure of five runners. With
400 yards to goI Shrader started
to pick off the men ahead of
him, one by one. He moved into
second only six yards behind,
before the Colgate runner pulled
away to win by twelve yards.

Coach Munsey, 'in ex laining
the loss gavc'credit to‘ t e very
strong Colgate team. In com-
paring them to Army, he cited

their superiority over Army in
the middlemen, but Army’s top
runners are better.

On past performances this
meet should have been very
close. But no one considered the
extraneous circumstances which
the Albany team was up against.
Only last Saturday, the Albany
team had to peak for the SUNY
Championship. Now, they had
to be thinking about the Albany
Invitational this Saturday. They
were not able to peak on this

V particular day.

This coupled by the long bus
trip, the cold, and nagging in-
juries, took the edge off the
Albany team. Next year, the
Colgate meet will be before the
Championships.

This Saturday. Albany hosts
the Albany Invitational. Coach
Munsey feels that the perfor-
mance against Colgate will have
no effect on the meet. He says
the team is not discouraged and
is not ready to lay down and

teams.

The Albany team will face top
competition from schools in the
East. Colgate who nipped Syra-
cuse and then soundly destroyed
Albany Is the early favorite.
Syracuse will also be here,
looking to avenge last weeks
defeat to Colgate. Albany is also
a favorite. Albany was nipped by
Army, a team that killed Syra-
cuse and lost to Colgate. On
their own course, in front of is
hopefully large crowd, the Al-
bany team should perform near
its peak. The times that the
Albany team ran in the SUNY
Championship would have con-
verted to a second place finish in
last year’s Invitational.

William Patterson and Keene
State are two schools which
could be long shots in this race.
Two top schools in the East,
CW. Post and Springfield are
entered, but their appearance at
the meet is in doubt. If they
should show up they would also
have to be considered good
choices.

Along with the Varsity race
which starts at 12:40, there is a
Junior College race at noon and
a J.V. race at 1:20. Last year's
champion in the Jr. College Di.

again favorites to take the title.

Danes Hope to Cure “Fum'bleilis”Soturdoy

The State University at Albany
football club, still unbeaten but
no longer unblemished, will take
a 4-0-1 record into a 1:30 pm.
game at Pace College, Saturday
(0cotber 28); The Great Danes
literally fumbled their chances
for a perfect season last week-
end, losing seven bobbles to
Brockport in a 13-13 tie.

Pace is 1-3-1, having beaten
Fairleigh Dickinson, 27-14 , last
weekend. The Setters have lost
to Kings, Hartford, and St.
John’s and played a scoreles tie
with Siena. Pace is basically a
running team Out of an I-
formation. Its best runner is
halfback Jack Owens, who goes
both ways, also playing defen«
sive end. Albany scouting re-
ports indicate defensive tackle
Ralph Zanfordino is the Setters’
top defensive player. The Danes
heat Pace, 28-0, in Albany in last
season ’5 ﬁnal game.

Despite setting several team
and individual rushing records,
Albany was frustrated by its
inability to hold onto the ball
against Brockport. In addition to
the seven lost fumbles, there was
a pass interception and a wind-

blown, onside kick recovered by
Brockport.

On the bright side, freshman
halfback Marvin Perry (Syra-
cuse) broke an 81-yard run from
scrimmage and totaled 191 yards

rushing for the.day, both new
school records. Additionally, he
is within 86 yards of the school
season rushing mark of 488.
Albany‘s 313 yards rushing total
also was a record. Coach Bob

Last Tucsday the Albany State
J.V, soccer team was over-
whelmed 8-2 by the J.V. power-
house of Oneonta State. The
Albany hooters were no match

quickly dcvclopcd into little
more than a showcase of

Defensively, Albany again
stopped several drives deep in its
territory and caused four Brock-
port turnovers: two fumbles and
two interceptions. The Danes
have intercepted 16 passes in
five games. Particularly out.
standing against Brockport was
freshman linebacker Ken Schoen
(Bellmore), who was in on 30
tackles, one short of the Albany
record. He also caused a fumble
and was named defensive back
of the week. Honored in the line
was defensive end Ron Gardner
(Great Neck), who participated
in 13 tackles and caused the
other Brockport fumble.

The entire Oneonta soccer pro-
gram has been an enormous suc—
cess this year with the varsity
compiling a 9-1 record and the
J.V. team boasting a 4-1-1 re—
cord. Oneonta blasted the Dane
Pups in the first half. scoring
four goals in the latter part of
the period. Each goal was the
result of crisp passing and good
ball-handling. Al. the same time,
Albany had trouble mounting
any serious offensive threats in
the face of the tenacious
Ont-onto defense. The offense
was able to manage only five
shots in the first half, one of
them bcing a goal by Wilhad
Rculcr on a shot from the right
sidl- at 35:20,

The second half strongly re-
scmblcd the first half in that
Onconta‘s offense and defense
continued to dominate play. Al-
bany was ublc to take only four
shots on goal while the Onconla
hooters pcppcred the Albany
gmtlic with a total of l‘uurly
shots, Onclilllo's relentless al-
lnl'k ncltcd Llll‘l'l' mortx scores in

bany goal was [he result of
nnntlll't' I'inc shot by Williad
liculcr at 13:20 of lhc sccond
