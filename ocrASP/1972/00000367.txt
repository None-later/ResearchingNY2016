“Almost-instant" subject list-
ings of library materials became
a reality in the library' at State
University of 'New York at Al-
bany. On Saturday, Oct. 21,
Community-University Day,
President Lords ’Il. Bcaeset acti-
vated the terminal linking the
library to the SUNY Biomedical
Communications Network com-
puter. The latter stores more
than 600,000 bibliographical
items online and more than a
million offline.

The new service, considered a
revolutionary development in
library service, will initiates new
service for SUNY faculty and
students and a new era in biblio-
graphical services at the library.

Presently the service will be
valuable especially to those
working in biomedical and re-
lated areas since the major por-

subjects, such related areas as
anthropology, education,
sociology, psychology and tech-

The system is suitable parti-
cularly for searching articles
concerning the relationship of
two or more speciﬁc nihiecis’; for
example, heart diseases and
smoking. When a properly for-
mulated request is submitted to
the terminal, almost instantly it
will type out a list of 10.recent
journal citations dealing with the
subjects requested. Additional
citations can be sought if
needed.

At the library the new service
will be provided by the Biblio«
graphical Services Unit of the
Reference Department. The de-
partment is a part of the Library
Reader-4' Service division, under
Anna May Lilly.

Grad School
I O C
For Minorities

A new program designed to
help the nation's graduate
schools seek out potential stu-
dents from minority groups is
underway this fall.

Called the Minority Graduate
Student Locater Service, the
program is offered by Educa-
tional Testing Service. ETS esti-
matm that about 10,000 to
15,000 students could initially
use the new service which is
offered free to both students
and institutions this year.

According to J. Bradley
Williams, ETS director of the
project, “One of the problems
facing graduate schools seeking
to increase enrollment of stu-
dents from racial and ethnic
minorities is that of identifying
potential students."

New Form Will Help

Now, students will have a
chance to voluntarily complete a
special 17-item questionnaire as
one step towards entering grad-
uate school.

information about the acade-
mic interests and goals of Black,
American-Indian, Asian-
American, and Spanish or Mexi-
can-American students who wish
to pursue graduate level educa-
tion, will be available to those
institutions seeking to bolster
minority enrollment.

Admissions ofﬁcers may then
contact students directly and
invite the applications of those
whose particular interests could
be served by their schools'
graduate offerings.

The locatcr service will be used
first by graduate schools in
December. According to
Williams, some 300 schools are
expected to join this year with
more offering the program later.

Nearly 2,200 counselors at
undergraduate schools across the
country have received informa-
tion about the program and can
supply questionnaires to inter-
ested students, whatever their
racial background.

The student response form is
also available with information
bulletins describing the Graduate
Record Examination (ORE). But
ETS suid GRE scores are not
included in the [center service
and that a student need not Laki-
the exam in order to participate
in the locater sorvico.

  Allen Center Ends Academic

Repetition by Combining Grades-

by Kathy Eckerle

Brubacher Hall reverberates
with a younger sound this year.
it hears a quicker step, a louder
laugh and, perhaps, feels the
pulse of a greater enthusiasm
than in previous years. For Bru-
bacher Hall houses the James E.
Allen Jr., Collegiate Center...the
Center that has brought the
senior year high school student
to the University.

Too often the high school cur-
riculum coincides with a typical
freshman year course load. The
Allen Center has eliminated this
duplication by combining these
two grades and relating the high
school-college learning ex«
parience as a continuous process.

After 11th grade the student
enters the University and, when
he successfully completes the
ﬁrst year, receives his diploma.
Eliminating a year of repeti-
tious study is only part of the
educational philosophy of the
Center. Their main goal is to
best prepare the students “for
useful and rewarding lives as
citiZens and as persons by mas-
tering specific problem areas
through an interdisciplinary
approach.”

Each semester during the four
year program deals with a cer-
tain inter-disciplinary topic-
human development, communi-
cations or the family to name a
few. The “Empirical Metho-
dology" section will teach the
students the technical know-how
to conduct laboratory experi-
ments in the Education, Religion
dz Morality, Economy and Gov-
ernment sectionsduringtheir final
two years. Field work is also an
integral part: each student will
be assigned, during their junior
and senior years, to (I private or
govvrnmcnt agency in conjunc-
tion with their Clusswork.

Admission to the Allen Center
is more stringent than for the
usual senior year applicant. The
same academic criteria is ap-
plied, but the maturity of the
student must also he considered.
