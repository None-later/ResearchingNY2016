PRINCETON, NJ. AP—The Gallup Poll reports that Democrat

George McGovern

is continuing to gain but still remains 23

percentage points behind President Nixon in their race for the

presidency.

McGovern’s greatest gains were among manual workers, where be
narrowed Nixon's lead to only 5 points—49 to 44 per cent, the poll
reported Wednesday. In August it was 63 to 28.

The over-all standings showed Nixon with 59 per cent to 36 per

cent for McGovern, one per cent
cent undecided, Gallup said.

The poll, taken from Oct. 13 to 1
registered voters.

August was the low point for

McGovern in the Gallup poll. A
64 per cent to 30 per cent for

McGovern and six per cent either undecided or for other candidates.
McGovern has gained in each Gallup poll since then. Gallup said

the movement of manual workers back toward their traditional

Democratic allegiance explained most of the Democrat's increase.
McGovern has also picked up some strength among Catholics and

Geller. Melvin Bers. Susan John-
son. Richard C. Teevan. Louis T.
Benezet.

All of the above people have
something in common. In some
way or another they are all
involved in the ﬁght to reinstate
Caroline Waterman of the

The Waterman

Psychology Department. This is
the story of that struggle and the
part played by each of the above
persons,

The story began some three
years ago, when Waterman was
"fired" and then suddenly rc-
instated,

Once again Dr. Waterman is up
for review, and her chances of
getting tenurc appear dim. 'l‘ruc,
many of her students consider
her the “best"professor in the
department. But that just points
out one of the problems in»
hcrcnt in the tenure system as it
operates at this University: How
important should the student
input be in making tenure de-
cisions'.’

Which seems to be one of the
central questions in the Water-
man case. As Dr. Waterman puts
it, “Who's in charge around
here?H

The Gauntlet

it seemed inevitable that the
Waterman case would surface
again. Three years may be along
time, but many of the depart-
mental objections to Waterman
survived and are as strong as
ever. But the main reason for the
sudden reappearance of the
Waterman case was the universi-
ty reouirement that a professor

Behavioral and Social Sciences.
The letter recommends that
Waterman not be given tenure,
and consequently no longer be
allowed to teach at this Universi-
ty.

own recommendation by Octo-
ber 318i. and then pass the case
on to l. Moyer Hunsberger, Dean

must undergo tenure review af-
ter teaching here for seven years.
if the professor passes the gaunt-
let of committees and deans
which comprises the tenure re-
view proccss unscathed, he (or
she) gets tenure and job security.
0n the other hand, if the profes-
sor is so unlucky as to be
stopped somewhere along the
line, he is officially out the door.

As of this writing it doesn‘t
appear that Waterman will be
able to successfully run the ten-
uri- gauntlet without a lot of
help, She got tiff to a rather
inauspicious start when her de-
partment recommended by a 9
to it vote not to grant her
tenure.

Department Chairman Richard
'l'ccvan was then required to
write a recommendation, or “lct~
ter of transmittal" to Melvin
Berti, the Associate Dean for

ences and his Faculty Personnel
Committee.

'I‘cevun's letter of transmittal
reads vory matter-of-factly. it is
intentionally written in an im-

personal manncr and sounds
very objective.
The lottcr describes Water-

man's performance in regard to

'l‘i-evan ft‘t'lii that Watcrman's
mastery of subject matter is
"about average," but that she is
"below average" in her ability as
a scholar, since she has written
only six articles in five years, “or
little more than an article a
year."

she is “above average" in depart-
mental service, having been ad-
visor to Cathexis, Psi Chi, and
chairperson of the Undergradu-
ate Curriculum Committee. In
“service at above the depart-
mental level" Teevan rates her as
below average, since she has
served on no university level
committees.

Teevan admits that “continu-

  

ing growth'. is a “very difficult

thing to assess." After some dis—
cussion he arrives at the con-
clusion that Dr. Wuterman’s
scholarship "is not up to par for
a tenured position at a Universi-
ty center.”

'l‘li c Department Chairman

does admit that Waterman's cf-
f'ectivunesii as a teacher is high,
and he rates her as “one of the

 

       
  
   
   

 

beat undergraduate teachers in
the department."
Not Everyone Happy

There are a lot of people on
this campus who disagree with
what Teevan's letter of transmit-
tal says about Waterman. Most
of them are students. There are
others, mostly faculty member!
and administrators, who do
agree. They don't feel Wateran
has done a very good job, The
students do.

Waterman disputes the conten-
tion that her "scholarly ability"
is questionable. While admitting
that she has written only one
article a year, she stresses the
quality of the works and not the
quantity. She claims that the
reviewers didn't look at quality
“closely enough."

Teevan felt that her service on
University Committees was not
adequate, but she claims that her
"readiness" to meet with her
students at any hour and her
"genuine interest" in her stu-
dents' interests is the “highest
kind" of university service, and
more important than serving on
committees and councils.

Almost everyone so far in-
volvcd in the Waterman case
agrees that she is a good teacher.
She was a semi-finalist for the
outstanding teacher award last
year, And her student evaluav
tions were extremely favorable.
'l‘hc evaluations are made on a l
to 5 level, with one being the
highest and 5 being lowest. The
lowest average score Waterman
ever received was a 1.6, and on
occasion she has earned a 1.0.
