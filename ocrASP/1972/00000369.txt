I McG Gaining

PRINCETON, NJ. AP-The Gallup Poll reports that Democrat

George McGovern

is continuing to gain but still remains 23

percentage points behind President Nixon in their race for the

presidency.

McGovern's greatest gains were among manual workers, where he
narrowed Nixon‘s lead to only 5 points—~19 to 44 per cent, the poll
reported Wednesday. In August it was 63 to 28.

The over-all standings showed Nixon with 59 per cent to 36 per
cent for McGovern, one per cent for other candidates and four per

cent undecided, Gallup said.

The poll, taken from Oct. 13 to 18, was based on questioning 1.220

registered voters.

August was the low point for McGovern in the Gallup poll. A
survey then showed Nixon with 64 per cent to 30 per cent for
McGovern and six per cent either undecided or for other candidates.

McGovern has gained in each Gallup poll since then. Gallup said
the movement of manual workers back toward their traditional
Democratic allegiance explained most of the Democrat's increase,

McGovern has also picked up some strength among Catholics and

under-30 voters, Gallup said, but Nixon continues to lead in all
major population groups except blacks and JeWs.

Where the Money is

WASHINGTON AP—Two
young heirs to a drug fortune,
grandsons to a secret campaign
contributor to President Nixon,
have loaned more than half a

million dollars to Democratic
presidential candidate George
McGovern,

The two are Nicholas Noyes of
Bloomington, lnd., and his bro:
ther, Daniel of Indianapolis.

A 2,100 page t-port by
McGovern for Pre.ident lnc. of
Washington, required under a
new federal e'i-t Lions Iiiw shows
Nicholas loaned the McGovern
campaign $200,000 on Sept. 12
and Daniel loaned another
$300,000 on Scpt. 20.

Together, the Noyes are the

All of the above people have

The Gauntlet

It seemed inevitable that the
Waterman case would surface
again. Three years may be along
time, but many of the depart-
mental objections to Waterman
survived and are as strong as
ever. But the main reason for the
sudden reappearance of the
Waterman case was the universi-
ty requirement that a professor

A U T

Behavioral and Social Sciences.
The letter recommends that
Waterman not be given tenure,
and consequently no longer be
allowed to teach at this Universi-

ty.

it is up to Beta to make his
own recommendation by Octo-
ber 31st and then pass the case
on to l. Moyer Hunsberger, Dean
of the College of Arts and Sci-

The Waterman Affair - Third in a Series:

"Who's in Charge Here???

Psychology Department. This is
the story of that struggle and the
part played by each of the above
persons.

The story began some three
years ago, when Waterman was
“fired” and then suddenly rcA
instated.

Once again Dr. Waterman is up
for review, and her chances of
getting tenure appear dim. 'l‘rue,
many of her students consider
her the “l)cst"profcasor in the
department. But that just points
out one of the problems iii-
hcrent in the tenure system as it
operates at this University: How
important should the student
input he in making tenure de-
cisions?

Which seems to be one of the
central questions in the Water»
man case. As Dr. Waterman puts
it, “Who’s in charge around
here?"

must undergo tenure review af-
ter teaching here for seven years.
if the professor passes the gaunt-
let of committees and deans
which comprises the tenure re-
view process unscathed, he (or
she) gets tenure and job security.
On the other hand, if the profes-
sor is so unlucky as to be
stopped somewhere along the
line, he is officially out the door.

As of this writing it doesn‘t
appear that Waterman will be
able to successfully run the ten«
urc gauntlet without a lot of
help, She got off to a rather
inauspicious start when her de-
partment recommended by a 9
to 8 vote not to grant her
tenure.

Department Chairman Richard
Teevan was then required to
write a recommendation, or “let-
ter of transmittal" to Melvin
Hers. the Associate Dean for

ences and his Faculty Personnel
Committee.

'l‘cevan's letter of transmittal
reads very matter—of-factly. It is
intentionally written in an im-

personal manner and sounds
very objective.
The letter describes Water-

man‘s pcrformancc in regard to
the five criteria for tenure and
promotion listed in the Faculty

service, and continuing growth.

'I‘cevan feels that Watcrman's
mastery of subject matter is
"about average," but that she is
“below average" in her ability as
a scholar, since she has written
only six articles in fin! years, “or
little more than an article a
year."

As far as her University service
is concerned, ’I‘eevan says that

she is “above average” in depart-
mental service, having been ad-
visor to Cathexis, Psi Chi, and
chairperson of the Undergradu-
ate Curriculum Committee. In
“service at above the depart-
mental ievel" Teevan rates her as
below average, since she has
served on no university level
committees.

Teevan admits that “continu-

ing growth‘. is a “very difficult
thing to assess." After some dis-
cussion he arrives at the con‘
clusion that Dr. Waterman's
scholarship "is not up to par for
a tenured position at a Universi-
ty center."

The Department Chairman
does admit that Waterman's ef-
fectiveness as a teacher is high,
and he rates her as “one of the

best undergraduate teachers in
the department."
Not Everyone Happy

There are a lot of people on
this campus who disagree with
what Teevan’s letter of transmit-
tal says about Waterman. Most
of them are students. There are
others, mostly faculty members
and administrators, who do
agree. They don’t feel Waterman
has done a very good job. The
students do.

Waterman disputes the conten-
tion that her “scholarly ability"
is questionable. While admitting
that she has written only one
article a year, she stresses the
quality of the works and not the
quantity. She claims that the
reviewara didn’t look at quality
“closely enough."

Teevan felt that her service on
University Committees was not
adequate, but she claims that her
"readiness" to meet with her
students at any hour and her
“genuine interest” in her stu-
dents' interests is the “highest
kind" of university service, and
more important than serving on
committees and councils.

Almost everyone so far in-
volved in the Waterman case
agrees that she is a good teacher.
She was a semi-finalist for the
outstanding teacher award last
year. And her student evalua-
tions Were extremely favorable.
The evaluations are made on a 1

to 5 level, with one being the
highest and 5 being lowest. The
lowest average score Waterman
ever received was a 1.6, and on
occasion she has earned a 1.0.
