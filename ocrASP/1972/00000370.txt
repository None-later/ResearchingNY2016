Food Fast for Half Way House

by Regina Colangelo

_On Wednesday, November 15,
Albany students will have an
opportunity to do a great service
to the community from which
they are only a few blocks re-
moved. By giving up supper on
this night F.S.A. will give the
money that would normally pay
for food to a community project
— a Half Way House for pri-
soners.

It is easy to forget that a few
blocks away from the isolated
Albany State campus, people are
facing problems of drugs,
housing, unemployment and im-
prisonment every day. One and a
half years ago the Community
Referral Center was organized
by former SUNYA student Gor<
don Van Ness in an effort to
help his community face and
solve these problems which had
become a way of life for the
people in the Arbor Hill section
of Albany,

The Community Referral Cen-
ter is a completely volunteer-
based organization which helps
people of the inner city deal
with problems of welfare, educa-
tion, health, drugs, alcoholism
and housing. The Center pl' -
its emphasis on dealing with the
total individual and his prob-
lems. The key to the program is
looking at individual needs and
trying to offer pasitive solutions
that will best serve the indivi-
dual.

ln View of the existing prob-
lems in prison, a new enterprise
was undertaken by the Com-
munity Referral Center. This
new enterprise, the Prison Pro»
ject, was developed and run by
Gordon Van Ness and Sam
McDowell. Under their direc-
tion, the project offers liaison
counselling, free legal counsel-
ling, free transportation to the
Albany County Jail and State
Institutions, and communication
between inmates and their
families, friends and employers.
The Prison Project has had an
80% success rate in securing cm~

“Don't get yourself into the
box where you think that voting
for McGovern is a referendum of
the anti-war movumcnt."

this Socialist Workers Party
view was expressed by Fred
Halstead, SWP l‘dtihl Presidential
candidate, at the "Forum for
Politics" last Monday evening,
The Young Socialist Alliance is
the young people's faction of
this party that currently sup»
ports Linda Jenncss and Andrew
Pulley as their presidential and
vice-presidential candidates.

the actual policy making

his party and of "big business“
to lllitlillrllll lhc relations he has
\vitli llit'lll, according to Hal
slciid.

Mcfiovern has said he is for an
end to the war in Vietnam, liiil
“every ainglc, solitary military
appropriation right down the
line, he voted for," stressed llal
stead. “ll was more important to
maintain party standings."

Ah the talk progressed, he grew
more and more vehement in his
argument against support of the

ployment for former inmates. It
has also found housing for these
men and their families, received
assistance for them through
Social Service, and established
social and civic events in the
community in which they can
get involved.

The latest endeavor in the Pri-
son Project is the restoration of
an old house at 67 First Street in
order to open a Half Way House
for prisoners and former pri-
soners. It will be an alternative
to incarceration and a preventive
rehabilitation center. Playing the
dual role of crime prevention
and rehabilitation, the Half Way
House will offer to the potential
offender and the former inmate
a place to go for education,
vocational training, community
resources, and social and civic
involvement. A liaison between
the Whitney Young Community
Health Center, hospitals in the
area and the Half Way House
will provide the men living there
with medical and psychiatric
treatment. The presence of a
Half Way House in the com-
munity will precipitate involve
ment between community mem-
bers and offenders and former
offenders.

Perhaps the most important
function of the Half Way House
will be to offer to the inmate
and former inmate a place to
acquire knowledge of what the
community is like

With this knowledge he will be
better equipped to adapt to the
community and the life from
which he has been removed for
years. Because these men have
been out of touch with the
community for so long and have
often lost all family ties, they
return from prison with no one
to rely on. This often leads them
back to the institution from
which they haVc been released
The Half Way House will seer
to function as the source which
these former inmates can rely

yelled llalstead, a large man,
heavy-jowled, with grey hair to
the collar in back and wire riin-

rent styles are copies of,

"The important thing is for
the oppressed to unite against
the opprcsaors," he asserted.
“What it boils down to is llll'

against me."

houses of this nature should
succeed in lowering the crime
rate in areas in which they exist
and offer the former prisoner
a better resocialization and
adaptation program than that
now offered in state penal insti-
tutions.

The Half Way House on First
Street will open in November to
inmates who are eligible for
parole within the next six
months. Until now,Sam and Gor-
don have recieved no govern-
ment assistance for either the
Community Referral Center or
the Prison Project which are
both desperately needed by the
Arbor Hill Community. Assis"
lance is needed in order to maki-
these ideas a reality and for the
survival of these projects.

Sam McDowell, (Jordon Van
Ness and the volunteers at the
Community Referral Center are
putting their ideas into action in
order to help their community
overcome the problems it is
facing. Albany " being our own
community for four years of our
lives * should be receiving our
help in solving these problems,
On Wednesday, Novvmber 13'),
we will have a chance to help by
participating in the campus wide
food fast to raise money for the
(Tommunity Referral Center and
the Prisoners' llalf Way House

In order to gel the money
from FHA, we need a list of
mean card numbers. 'l‘alilcs Will
be set up at the dinner lines on

By giving up one dinner we can
help make possible the prisoners'
