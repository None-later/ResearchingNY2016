Vietnam’s New Map

by Richard Pyle
Associated Press Writer

Saigon AP - With an indo-
china ceasc‘fire apparently near,
the map of South Vietnam looks
remarkably as it did 10 years
ago, Then the Viet Cong insur-
gents were running wild in the
countryside and the Saigon
government was struggling to
keep populated areas under con»
trol and highways open.

Today, as then, most of the
850—mile border from the demili-
tarized zone to the Gulf of Siam
is under the Communist-led
forces' control or is a jungle no
man's land ignored by both sides

Most Areas Open
Major cities, including all it
provmcc capitals, are fir l '

Saigon government hands, but
around some are concentrations
of enemy forces who harass de~
fenders, close roads and propa-
gandize the local people as they
did in the early ‘titls.

Most main highways are open
most of the time. but any one of
these vital lines of communica‘
tion can be closed at any
moment, almost anywhere.

Around Saigon itself, longtime
Communist strongholds like the
iron 'l'rianglc, War Zone (3, the
Saigon River corridor and the
rubber plantations liayc again
become operating bases for
enemy forces after a few years
of relative quit-t.

Cmﬁrl‘ designed to freeze the
forces of both sides in place at
the moment of the truce, the
question of who controls what is
of crucial importance. 'l‘o at-
tempt to measure this on a map
is deceptive because of the vast
areas of no contest, and because
the struggle continues to be
more concerned with people
than with land,

South Holds Upper Hand

Despite its severe setbacks of
the last seven months and des-
pite the appearance of the map,
the South Vietnamese goverir
menl still clearly holds the upper
hand.

from the U.S.—-backea pacific:-

government controlled 90.1 per
cent of the 19.1 million people
at the end of September, with
7.2 per cent in contested areas
and 2 per cent dominated by the
North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong.

These figures represent a pro«
greasive improvement since June,
when the Communists’ military
campaign peaked out on pacifi-
cation charts with 557,000
people, almost 3 per cent of the
total. under enemy control.

Although having given back
that one percentage point, the
Communist side is in a far stron-
ger position, strategically and
politically, than it was when the
offensive began March 30,

Some senior allied officials be-
lieve that while the enemy miliv
tary drive did not achieve its
overall objectives, Hanoi and
the Viel Cong probably are rea-
sonably satisfied with their
gains.

Some also believe that a cease-
fire plan that required the North
Vietnamese to withdraw from
the South, as President Nguyen
Viin 'I‘hieu has demanded, would
leave a Viet Cong force too weak
to control much of what has
been gained or to resist South
Vietnamese efforts to quietly
take it back,

Communist Stronghold

Areas of strongest Communist
influence are in the northern and
western parts of northernmost
Quang 'l'ri Province and the
mountains that run southward
along the coast and provide sanc-
tuaries for forays into populated
'owlands. This is true despite the
fact the South Vietnamese again
control the provmciiil capital,
Quang ’l‘ri.

In addition, tne Communist
side controls most of the central
highlands region along the Laos-
Canibodia tri border area, most
of the highland provinces of

Kontum, l’lciku and chunks of

Phu Bon and the coastal pro~
vinccs of Quang Ngai, Binh Diiili
and Min Yen.

Areas lost in the early days of
the enemyls spring oflemive and
not retaken include the border
areas northwest and north of
Saigon. Although An Loc sur-
vived a siege that petered out
after four months, Highway 13
remains a focal point and is still
closed in spots.

In many of these area the
people fled the fighting, creating
a burden of more than a million
new refugees but at the same
time depriving the Communist
side of a large pool of hostages,
propanganda subjects and con-
scripted recruits.

Saigon Blasts US.

by R. Gregory Nokes

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON AP—Saigon to-
day issued its strongest criticism
to date of the U.S.-Hanoi agree-
ment to end the Vietnam war, as
the Nixon administration con-
tinued to say the United States
won’t be ready to sign the
cease-fire by Tuesday as the
North Vietnamese have de-
manded.

Meanwhile, the Viet Cong said
it is determined to continue the
war unless the United States
either dumps South Vietnamese
President Thieu or forces him to
accept the agreement.

In a broadcast over the official
government station, the South
Vietnamese said “whatever our
ally's doings," Thieu ‘.‘will not
sanction mass suicide by the
people of South Vietnam."

The broadcast sarcastically re-
ferred to the United States as an
“ally who plays the role of
negotiator" and said 'I‘hicu
would not sign an agreement
which he believes would result in

a coalition government down to
the hamlet level and which con-
tained no provision for with-
drawal of North Vietnamese
troops from the South.

Sunday, Vice President Spiro
T. Agnew and Republican Na-
tional Chairman, Sen. Robert
Dole of Kansas, both said they
didn't believe a case-fire would
be agreed toby Tuesday.

Dole, in a televised appearance,
said he did not believe the ac-
cord would he signed before the
Nov. 7 presidential elections.

Another prominent Republi-
can, Sen. Edward W. Brooke of
Massachusetts, commenting on a
private briefing by Nixon and
top administration officials, also
said today that he did not think
the case-fire would be signed by
election day.

Brooke said, however, the
United States might sign an
agreement even if ’I‘hieu refused,
and added that the briefing left
him convinced that the United
States considered Tliieu's objec-
tions “political rhetoric."

Albany Prison Break

ALBANY, NY. AP—Three
poliCe agencies, the local district
attorney's office and the state
have begun investigations into
Friday night's massive Jailbreak
at the Albany County Jail. Au-
thorities said today that nine of
the 12 escapees were still at
large.

One of the escapees was cap-
tured Saturday night on a down»
town rooftop. The other two
were arrested in their Albany
homes. All surrendered peace
fully, officers said.

The county jail warden,
Robert Beamc, said the pri
soncrs, armed with at least one
knife, overpowered guards inside
the jail, injuring one slightly, and
locked them in a utility closet
The inmates used keys taken
from the guards to make their
way through a series of gates,
they said

Once outside, the men com
lllillldt‘l'l't‘tl a police van and sped
away The van was later found
abandoned on a downtown Al
baiiy street

One of the men still at large,
Ronald Miller, 21, of Albany,
was inadvertently released from
the jail five months ago and was
at large for four months. Securi
ty conditions at the jail were
sharply criticized in separate re
ports by an Albany County
grand jury and by the State
Correction Commission.

The commission, which has
supervisory authority over local
jails in the state, assigned two
staff members to the probe of
Friday night‘s breakout.

Dist. Atty. Arnold Proskin said
he would begin another lllVUstl‘
gation of the jail, and city, coun'
try and state police also began
investigations.

(Taptured on a rooftop after
police rcCi-ived a tip Saturday
night was 'l‘yrone Murphy, it)
Later that night police seized
Ronald Phillips, ‘13, at his home,
and Clarence Mctiary Jr, 17,
was arrestcd at his home nearby
early Sunday.

Police said the search for the
missing men would continui-

 

The. Key Question is Why?

by Mary Dresser

Newswoman Elizabeth Drew’s
key question is “Why?”

Each Monday at 7:30 pm. she
"Thirty Minutes
With..." interview program on
Channel 17 over the Public
Broadcasting Service by gently
leading her guest through a state-
ment of position. Then she
smiles and quietly asks: “Why?”

A-recent interview with Adm.
Thomas H. Moorer, Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, illu-
strates this technique:

Mrs. Drew: (Should this coun-
try be) number one, militarily?

Adm. Moorer: Number one in
every area. Number one in
sports, number one in industry,
number one militarily, number
one across the board.

Mrs. Drew: Why?

Adm. Morrer: Becausr do you
want to be number two'!

Such “why?” questions are part
of the implicit bargain Elizabeth
Drew believes she has made with
her audience. The bargain is to
value truth above TV entertain-
merit.

She sees her job as “getting
into the issues and laying them
out" so that her viewers can
draw their own conclusions,

“That‘s what democracy and
journalism is all about," she says
simply.

Mrs. Drew prepares for inter-
views by asking lierself‘ "if I (as
a viewer) had a half hour with
this person, what would I want
to know?"

She avoids the oVi-rtly aggres-
sive questions because she be
lieves this distracts Lllt‘ Viewers'
attention from the subject “In
side Washington" gossip is also
taboo on “'l‘hirty Minutes
With..." because Mrs. Drew ln-A
licves such questions take valu»
able time from an interVit-w
without shedding light on issues
of national importance

In order to build her instincts
for the right question at the
right time, Mrs l)ri-w spends as
much time as pussllilt' outside
Washington. She reads a lot,
talks to people in other parLs of
the country, and listens to her
friends" ideas.

Mrs. Drew’s questions are cho-
sen very thoughtfully. She be-
lieves it is essential to show her
guest's thinking process and not
simply his political reﬂexes.

“I don't want to get verbal
press releases or non-answers to
questions they obviously can't
answer,” she says.

If her guest is a candidate for
ofﬁce, Mrs. Drew may ask how
this person would change the
country. If the guest is already
in ofﬁce, her questions focus on
the things that have already been
achieved.

The single-person interview
format of “Thirty Minutes
With.,." gives Mrs. Drew 3

unique opportunity to follow up
a line of questioning and re-
spond to rapidly-changing news
development.

She recalls developing a set of
questions on the India-Pakistan
situation prior to interviewing
Defense Secretary Melvin Laird
and quickly discarding all these
questions upon learning that
massive troop withdrawals from
Vietnam had just been an-
nounced. Mrs. Drew decided on
camera that troop withdrawals
were more important to her
audience than the Mid-Eastern
situation.

She also threw away her pre-
pared questions on agribusiness
while interviewmg Agriculture
Secretary Earl But‘l. because she
sensed that food prices had be-
come a significant issue in the
nation.

Members of the working press
are among Mrs. Drew's regular
viewers because news stories
have a history of breaking unr
cxpcctedly on “'l‘hirty Minutes
V th..." Elizabeth Drew intch
Hen may turn up on the front
page of the morning paper or as
part of a “think piece" several
months later.

It was a front page story iii
May, l972, when Presidential
speech writer Patrick J. Bu
chanan charged the major net
works with bias and threatened
some type of anti trust action
However, it took nine months
before the Wall Street Journal
realized that in October, 197],
AFL'CIO George Mcaiiy told
Elizabeth Drew that if the

W

Democrats split with the “old
tradition"’...“Mr. Nixon will be
almost reelected by default."

Mrs. Drew concentrates on in—
terviewing during the program.
She makes her own incisive ob-
servations in the column she
writes as Washington Editor of
The Atlantic Monthly. More
than a year ago, in April, 1971,
she was noting that: "George
McGovern is being under-
estimated as a candidate. He is a
much tougher man than most
descriptions of him suggest, and
he has done a lot of quiet work
to get his candidacy moving."

This perception is not un
noticed by her audience. Ac-
cording to a New York lawyer:
“Elizabeth Drew...has been a
main source of vital, important
information, presented in level-
headed and non-dogmatic fash-
ion."

A priest in Saint Paul, Minne—
sota, says: "Your characteristic
genius lies in your ability to
steer a gracious course between
being bland and resorting to
needling,"

A housewife in Maryland calls
Mrs. Drew “one of the few great
interviewers on television,“ and
a doctor in New York says “If
woman‘s liberation means more
Drew, then let's get on with it.“

Mrs. Drew is conscious that
many women in America are
looking toward her as an exam-
ple of professional excellence.
Her mail is filled with testi-
monial letters from such diVerse
women as San Francisco house-
wives and the formidable pub-
lisher of Ms., Gloria Steinem.

However, her reaction to w
man‘s liberation is characteris-
tically that of the professional
journalist who happens to be a
woman. She seems genuinely
surprised that “people are taking
it so seriously that a woman is
doing this." She believes the fact
that she is a woman is “periphe-
ral” to liei job, but admits that
it has become very significant to
many men and women.

"After listening to people I am
beginning to believe that this is a
really serious issue in this coun-
try," she says. “It is important
and it hits very, very deep."

Mrs. Drew wants to continue
her “Thirty Minutes With..." in-
terviews on the Public Broad-
casting Service because she be-
lieves commercial television is
doing very little OIIC'LO'OIN.‘ inA
tervicwing.

She believes that the real isigni-
ficance of TV public affairs in
tcrviewing in contrast to written
interviews is that it permits the
audience to draw its own conclu-
sions.

“You can write a profile of a
person, but no matter how well
it is done, that sense of cheniis»
try doesn't come through, The
people are forced to their con-
clusions through the writer's
Words."

Of her half-hour profiles, Mrs.
Drew concludes, “I always finish
feeling there could hich been
much more-but perhaps that's
the way it should be."
