Opinion:

Most people today are ill-
equipped to understand gays.
The attitudes they hold are the
product of long years of misin-
formation and miseducation. it
is time for people throughout
the nation to reassess their posl~
tion. to replace the myths. and
to try to adjust their attitudes.

Why Are We So Biased?

Rejection of homosexuals goes
beck a long. long time. Once
considered witches. they are
cohdemned in the early days of
the Judeo-Chrlstlsn era as an
abomination. sinful wrong. in
days when survival of the species
was in question. opposition to
homosexuality is understand-
able. in these days of concern
for over-population. the same
condemnation is harder to sup-
port.

A second way the straight soci-
ety deals with homosexuality is
to label it "sick." Supposedly
this movas the treatment from
punishment to cure. to therapy;
but history shows that some
forms of therapy are more pun-
ishment than some punishment.
The medical model helps many
straights be better able to handle
the notion that there is such a
thing. it makes the straights feel
safer. if heterosexuals can put
homosexuality in a category.
with a label. they can put it with
the other unpleasant diseases
and try to change the behavior
to conform to their own. the
straights' way of behaving.
which by natural assumption is
"well."

Another cause of bias in many
straights is their own fear of
their own homosexual feelings.
All of us have the hormones or
both sexes. with or without sex.

Freud's notion of proleo
tlon comes through clearly in
much of the hostility thrown on
the homosexual. Perhaps the

research on lei-sexuality. which is
just really beginning. may help
society understand better the
possibilities of wider circles of
deep friendship.

Furthermore. what literature
there has been dealing with
homosexuality that has had wide
circulation has tended to empha'
siu the stereotypes and to ex'
plore the darker side of the Gay
ward. Little sensitive acceptance
has reached the general publicI
although there is some change in
the wind quite recently. Certain-
ly there has been little that
really helps put down the stereo-
types and the myths available to
the concerned counselor.

Some of tlie Myths

Ail Gays are unhappy. promis-
cuous charters after a substitute
for “the real thing" which has
eluded them because of some
family disaster that makes the
lily male hate women and the
any female hate men; homo-
sexual relationships cannot last.
Because most of what was writ'
ten until very recently came Out
of the clinic. where those Gays
who were unhappy were being
treated by those professionals
who labeled them slck. a deso-
late picture of the homosexual
has emerged. Only with the de-
velopment of Gay Liberation

have many homosexuals dis-
covered not only that they were
not "the only one" (a pliilrit
voiced repeatedly by those now
“out"). but also that there are
Gays who are self-assured. ac-
cept themselves and are not
guilt-ridden. The few who have
overcome the pressures of socie-
ty are leading the way for the
many who have felt too op-
pressed to break out. And while
there are homosexuals who are
promiscuous, and like to brag of
their exploits. there are many
who are most restrained in their
sexual activity. in other words.

the variety of sexuality in on!"
is just as. it il pi the insist"
world. 80. ice. I" ll" i°"'
relationships. PeOPi' "’m i°
forget the tempestuous love sf-
fairs of many heterosexual teens
when they react to the "fragile
relationships" between home-
sexuals.

Male homosexuality is caused
by having a dominant mother
and weak father; Gays hate peo-
ple of the opposite sex; homo~
sexuality is unnatural: homo-
sexuality is biochemical-genetic
in nature (homonally induced).
Just listing these myths together
shows that the straight world
keeps fishing for causes. but
contradicts itself. it does not
seem possible to list the cause.
or causes. of homosexuality. For
those who are it. it is natural. No
one in this society would
"choose to be homosexual." in
our oppressive society. unless
very strong feelings inside told
co that that was the way for co.
(Here "co" is used to replace the
“sexed” pronouns. his or her.
him or her). The human male
does not tell his penis what to
react to; it reacts or it doesn't.
The "unnatural" argument does
not hold when comparisons are
made across history or across
cultures. Nor is there any high
correlations between homosexu~
ulity and the decline of a society
(there may be with "decadent"
societies. since by the definition
of straight society. homosexuali-
ty is decadent).

Removing laws against homo-
sexuality would increase the
number of homosexuals. There
is no logic to support this argu-
ment; society is never going to
encourage homosexuality. nor

should it (any more then It
should insist that all heterosexu‘
al couples have children). Willie
legalization might allow some
who are homosexual to be more
open about their preferences. it

will not change those inner feel-
tags which direct us toward our
sexual mates. Since Kinsey's
figures show over 50 percent of
males in the States have had at
least one homosexual contact to
the point of climax. but not
even the wildest estimates of the
percent of the population that is
Gay go above 20 percent. it
seems clear that a single experi-
ence does not make a person
turn homosexual. Even if “up-
sst. confused adolescents may be
led by weil'adjusted Gays to
think "That must be what i am.
i'll try lt'." as one of my friends
warned the other di'iy. the evi-
dence does not support their
taking up homosexuality as a
primary focus of their sexuality
unless there are other factors
involved besides an unclear iden~
tit
What Can People Do?

Many people could rid them-
selves oi many of tleir stereo-
types and hang-ups by talking
with representatives of the Gay
Liberation groups. They will dia'
cover that they will not be se-
duced. nor assaulted. nor even
put down. Gayslust want others
to see them as human beings.

Gascoyne Decision Wrong

1‘!) the Editor:

l’lciisc grant me the oppor-
tunity to correct an error which.
i believe. was contained in your
issui- of Octobcr ‘27. Mr. von
Ntistit‘L. in his rcpori on “The

ri-i’iisi-ri iii criiiiiricnt iiii wlicliicr

hurl lilt‘ Illliilllnitills \lllllifll‘l of

his colleagues in the department
and the enthusiastic endorse-
ment of his students. I did.
however. indicate to Mr. Von
Nostit'l. that i do not reproach
those who arrchd at a different
conclusion To the best of my
knowledge all individuals in-
volved in this case have acted in
good friiih and without malice.
