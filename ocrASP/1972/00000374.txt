Judge Nanette Demblts is the
first womsn candidate for the
New York State Court of Ap-
peals which. as site explained to
a group of SUNYA students laitt
F'rlday afternoon. has presented
some special problems. "Thu
concern is that it puts women in
a more authoritative role in the
legal system." said Judge Dem-
blts. She hss been asked to
show. in her words - “a serious
interest. not just a skirt." Her

should be assumed from her
record.

The Court of Appeals la the
highest court in New York State
it interprets the State Constit
utlon and handles cases from the
lower courts. A sprinkling of
women can be found on the
lower courts in New York State.
but none on the aﬁimemhcr
intermediate court nor on the
7-member Court of Appeals. The
Women's Movement has expres-
sed a desire for more women to
hold positions of authority

Rockefeller htid at one time
said that the time has ended
when men alone should sit on
the Court of Appeals. However

But so far it twt‘mtl that other
criteria. namely scholarly ability
and university service. outwaigii
the student evaluations in the
eyes of her fellow faculty ins-.m-
bars who voted against giving her
either tenure or promotion.

According to Waterman. tllt‘
issue is “the rights of students to
get their money's worth 4 as

She feels that students should
have a louder voice in (lat-nouns

Judge Demqu said. "If liberal
constructionist means exploring
the actual impact of law on the
hurnsn being and on lives. than
you would have to call me llbv
ersl. But it should not be con-
sldercd a liberal point of view
but rather s rational point of
View."

To illustrate. Judge Dembtu
cited an example of s can of a

he was 13 veers old Although
he was never declared guilty. the

in the case of s decision of not

American system. one is in

Therefore because no guilt was
determined. a record of srreet

look at what is — at the social

destroyed.

Judge Donut: illustrated her
beliefs with further examples.
Recently there was a cue before
the Court of Appeals concerning
student voting in their campus
town. '11:- ruling was that stu‘
dents may vote only in their
home towns. The reality of this
decision. Dombits felt. was to
impede the right of a student to
vote. The emphasis should be on
increasing the suffrage. The
Federal Court ruled in accor-
dance with Judge Demblu‘s bO'
liefs.

Dembiu's last example of the
necessity for s Judge to be aware
of the social consequences of s
ruling concerned another Court
of Appeals case. The Court ruled
that Medicaid could not be used
for sbortions, Judge Dembits
said that the actual result of this
chision is that the poor can not
get abortions while the rich csn
