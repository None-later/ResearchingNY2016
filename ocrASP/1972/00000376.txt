This past Saturday saw the
battle for the cellar between
Albany’s Danes and Potsdsm's
Bears. and. as if to prove their
cellar filling qualifications. both
played miserably. 0n the whole.
Albany played a better game.
but it Was Potsdam who put
three in the net. to our big zero.
Once again it was a case of
missed opportunities. sub par
play by several key players. cru-
cial minor injuries. and George
Keleshian being ejected from the
game for the second straight
time.

The game began with an al-
ready hobbled John Thayer in
the Net for the Danes. but
Thayer was re-injured on a great
save and had to leave the game
in favor of Steve Carlsen after
only two minutes of play had
elapsed. ’i‘he Danes came out
flat. and Potsdam scored a goal
on a cornerkick early in the
game. After the goal. a patched
up John ’i‘hayer reentared the
game. but Potsdam continued to
control the mid-field area. and
the Danes just could not put it
together.

After a second goal was scored.
the Danes mysteriously came
alive; something which has
characterized their play this

For The Cellar

year. Suddenly. Albany began to
keep play on Potsdam’s side.
Just when things looked much
brighter for the Danes. George
Keleshlan met the mud, came up
fighting. and was consequently
elected from the game. This not
only took one of our better
offensive players out of the
game. but also demorailzed the
team. The half ended with the
Danes down 2-0.

The Danes came out of the
half time huddle with a sus-
tained rush at the Potsdam goal.
For the first 10 minutes of the
second hall'.the hull stayed on
the Potsdam half of thc field.
Albany dominated play. but
missed shots were the whole
story. l’lve times definite goals
Were missed: Carlos Alvarez
mlsacd ll breakaway; Hcrzog had
the whole net to shoot at. but
hit the goalie instead. etc. At
one point. Leon Bcdcfian drih«
bled through half the Potsdam
team. only to haVe his beautiful
centering pass botched up In
front of the not.

The DIInL-s' domination of play
soon ended. and u sci-vsaw battle
developed; one which saw seve-
ral Albany rushes go by the

boards. and a Potsdam goal.

The name of the game is scor-
ing, and the Danes Just are not
doing last that. despite out-
shooting their opponents by a
24-11 margin.

’i‘wo players prevented a real
rout of our Great (7) Danes—
Mark Solano and Clifi‘ Wslzer.
Cliff has been our second most
consistent player this year. and
has been doing an outstanding
job on the wing. As for Mark. he
played his greatest game ever. He
was all over the field. beating
everyone to the ball. keeping his
man from touching it. and
sliding others out if they had
the ball. These two guys played
their guts out. but all to no avail.
as Larry Hcrzog had his first
mediocre game of the season.
and the team followed his
example.

The regular season is over. but
it can be more than salvaged by
a win In Albany. Fan support
will be an absolute must if Al-
bany iii to sweep. Because the
competition is really not that
good. we have at. least a fifty per
cent chance of winning. With
your help. the team will win.
Remember. this team represents
yuurschool.

TUESDAY. OCTOBER 31, 1972

 

 

 

by Mike lgoe

A driving rain and a football
field which seemed like an over-
grown mud puddle set the stage
Saturday as the Albany football
team literally swam by Pace
26-0.

Conditions were so bad that
the Great Danes decided to kick-
off rathcr than receive although
they won the toss.

It was a good move on the part
of the Danes since the wind
would have been ugianst the
Pace kicker and, the forcefulncss
of the rain might huvc givcn
Albany players a hard tiniv
fielding.

As it turned out. the decision
proved to be an advantiigc in thi-
Griddcrs.

The Albany dcfcnsc, which is
fast becoming a lcgcnd in its
time. prevented the Setters from
doing anything with their first
possession of the game.

When the Dimes got “10 ball.
they didn't furc any bettcr on
the slippery surface and had to
turn the ball over to thc Scttcrs.
Once again State's dcfonsivc unit
went to work and Pncc couldn‘t
pick up a first down

John Bertuzzi came on and got
the Danes moving.

McCoy Allister and Marvin l’I-r
ry riin hard through the muck to
pick up good yardage and ad
vuncv thc squad.

collected five extra yards with
four Pace defenders on his back.
Then Noel Walker. making his
first start of the season. mugit a
Bertuzzi pitchout and splashed
ahead 28 yards for a touchdown.
Mark Fuller's conversion kick
gave Albany :1 7-0 lead which
lasted into the second quarter.
The Setters experienced morc
difficulty penetrating in the
second period. 'l‘hcir larthcst IId-
vnnccmont was to their own if)
whom they promptly fumblcd.
Bnrtu'tzi mixed up thc running
game among Allister, Walker.
