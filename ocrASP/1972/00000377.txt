Vice President John Hartley: “We have a serious situation."

Students Meet Hunsberger

by Glenn von Nostitl

Several students heading the
fight to reinstate Psychology
Professor Caroline Waterman
met with 1. Meyer Hunsbcrgcr,
Dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences yesterday afternoon.
The students presented Huns-
burger with a list of some 2300
student signatures on petitions
supporting Waterman in her
quest for tenure.

The students presented the
petitions as evidence to br' used
when the Waterman case reaches
Hunsbvrger and his Faculty Per-
sonnel (Iommittcv sometime in
tlic ncur future.

After br-ing presented with
tho pctitions, Dean llunsbcrger

The students pointed out that
the Psychology Department has
already reached a decision on
the Waterman case, recommen-
ding she be denied tenure by a
9-8 vote, and that “going back
to the department" would not
be worthwhile. Hunsbergcr rc-

llunsbcrgcr and the students
were extremely cordial. Huns

seven children. all of whom
“have been students."

FSA Faced With Hard Times

- An end to the subsidation
of dorm director meals.

— An end to support of In-
firmary meals.

- A limit to the amount of
money available through the
FSA loan service.

The various measures were
presented for discussion by
Faculty-Student Association

minislriition building, Zzihm was

Zuhni said he was mi-ri-ly pro-
scnling the package as a possible
means of improving the financial
position of tho corporation.

“These ill‘t‘ mcrcly alli'rnu-
fll't's,” lH‘ i-xplziined. “At this
point they are not specific reA
cornmcndations from the main
argument."

It will be up to the Board of
Directors -- a group of ten com-
posed of faculty, students and
administration to study the
"alternatives" and come up with
speciﬁc recommendations. But it
seems likely that some of the
alternatives Zuhin drew up will
become reality very soon,
though perhaps in modified
form. Discussion at Monday's
meeting centered around thv
deteriorating financial position
of li‘SA and immediate fiscal
constraint «merged as the mosl
immediate likely coursi‘.

Complicating the ﬁnancial
picture is the increasing reluc-
tancy of area banks to grant
lines of credit to FSA -- money
the corporation needs to pay off
debts, meet costs, and keep out
of bankruptcy.

The net worth of the corpora-
tion decreased by some
$200,000 last year and the de-
creasing figurr- is an indicator to
tho banks of a steadily worsen-
ing ﬁnancial situation. Net
worth is similar to collateral for
a loan and such a dramatic de-
crease in the figure, when viewed
in the context of dr-creasing sales
and steady losses, results in a
diminishing bank credit line.

FSA management had difﬁ-
culty securing the needed
$000,000 credit line this year
but Wert- eventually successlul
after arduous negotiating ses-
sions. “Fortunately,” Hartley
told the board, “we had a
friendly bank." But even so,
FSA must pay a service charge
above the usual interest rate,
send the bank monthly budget
reports and renegotiate the loan
in April rather than October.
This is evidence that the cor-
poration is considered a poor
credit risk.

And it is no wonder. FSA
came out in the red again last
year. The final loss was
$123,000, an improvement on
the $217,000 loss of a year
buforc but extensive

Hartley explained that the
point has been reached where
the corporation can not absorb
any more losses and still receive
credit from local banks. That is
why l’SA management is placing
such an important emphasis on
i-nding the year on, at the very
lt‘iuil, a break even point.

Unfortunately, they may not
got it. The first quarter audit is
complete and it offers little hope
for improvement. Food service
and bookstore sales are down
and profits for the period are
approcmbly loss than at this time
last year. Overall, l’SA losses are
running substantially higher at
