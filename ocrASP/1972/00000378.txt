Meet John Chow. He is the
Editor-in-Chief of "Torch", the
SUNYA yearbook. He is con-
cerned. His purpose in this year's
edition of the “Torch” is to
represent the students in record-
ing the events of importance
during this past year.

Last year, there was some con-
cern over the contents of the
“Torch”. The Editor-in-Chlef
and his Editorial board saw fit to
include pictures of bodies with-
out heads and other symbols of
their anti-Vietnamese feelings
within these pages. A number of
people in the student body, in-
cluding the Central Council,
voiced strong objections to this.
Consequently, as of last spring,
the budget for the “Torch” was
frozen and vJohn' Chow found
himself in quite a predicament.
Although he was in no way
responsible for the actions of his
predecessors, work on this year’s
yearbook was suspended until
the Central Council could decide
on some sort of action to insure
that nothing objectionable
would be placed within the pa-
ges of this year’s “Torch”.

Thus, school began, but work
on the book didn‘t. A month
passed and still no decision was
reached. According to Chow,
when he approached Michael
Lampert, President of the Stu-
dent Association, and asked him
if he could speak at a Central
Council meeting to put forth his
views and ideas for this year's
publication, permission was dc-
nied. So, Chow was forced to
speak privately to each indiviv
dual Council member. Finally,
he was able to speak to the
Council as a whole. He explained
that as of that point, the
“Torch” was in terrible condi
tion because work could not be
started until the budget was un~
frozen. The backlog of work was
so great that there was even a
possibility of not being able to
catch up with enough time to
put the book togethcr.

After prolonged discussion and
interrogation, the Central Conn-
cil ﬁnally decided to unfreeze
the budget with the provision
that there be a representative
from the Council, the Media
Coordinator, who would be plii-
ced on the Editorial Board. This
Board is a group of eight people
whose job is to assist the Editor‘
in-Chief in all matters of concern
to the yearbook. However, it is
provided in the constitution of
the school that the Editor-in-
Chief has the ﬁnal say in all
matters and cannot be overruled.
If the Media Coordinator,
Debbie Nathanson, who is also
connected with WSUA, the ASP,
Sweet Fire and other channels of
communication among the stu-
dent body, objects to something
being considered for publication
in the "Torch", she has the right
to bring it to the Central Coun-
cil. However, John doesn’t fore-
see any such circumstance

John has already personally
received many complaints about
the contents of last year's issue.
Students seem to want to have
campus life better represented.
So, John is trying to do just
that. He feels that the students
are the ones who are really in
charge of the book and he is
subject to their demands. They
are the ones who are funding the
book and to whom the book is
directed. The term "radical" in
itself doesn't have much mean
ing for John. He agrees with
Einstein in that everything is

relative. To use his own cx«
ample, to include pictures and
comments about Kent State in
that year's yearbook was looked
upon as perfectly acceptable
then since it did affect each
student's lifc personally. it was
something that uniformly af-
fected college campuses across
the country. However, if some-
thing violent were to be included
in this year’s yearbook, it just
wouldn't apply. But since no
one can tell the fuiurc, some-
thing that is out-of—placetoday,
may be accepted as part of the
norm tomorrow. The term rad~
ical may therefore change in
meaning from day to day, if tlil‘
situation demands it, John will
indeed include "radical" mater
ial. Things that affect the life of
a SUNYA student, whether they
occur locally, nationally or own

internationally, are of impor-
tance to the “Torch.” He feels
that people are bored with the
traditional college yearbook ﬁll-
ed with group pictures of various
people. Without giving away any
surprises that might be contain-
ed in this‘yesr‘s “Torch”, John
said that the students can look
forward to a creative and artistic
book. Acdleget yearbook doesn’t
necessarily have to be boring or
stuffy. it can be a tool for
artistic and imaginative people.

Despite a out of two thousand
dollars from last year's budget
and the vast amount of rising
costs, John is sure that this
year’s book can and will be a
superior piece of work. it will be
a book on the happy side, be-
cause as John said, there is
enough pessimism in the world
without this adding to it. The
student body is so often apath-
etic, that they need something
to create some enthusiasm, The
entire “Torch” staff is extremely
enthusiastic and very dedicated
to their work. They have been
and will continue to work very
hard on the book. it doesn't
have to be drab, and after talk-
ing to John Chow, this reporter
is convinced that it couldn't be.

The expccicd datc of release is
May lst. 'l‘hc untirc student
body is welconw to purchase the
"Torch" at lhai time By all
signs, it should be well worth the
money Buy il 'l‘hc University
needs cheering up.

ﬁghting in Vietnam for was to
permit the South Vietnamese
the luxury of democratically
choosing their own government, -

, then we should immediately pull

out.| In fact, claimed Mr. Buck-
ley, who bore an uncanny resem-
blance to his more famous
brother Bill, Mr. Nixon upon
taking ofﬁce should have deter-
mined immediately whether or

.rzot South Vietnam was vital to

our own national defense. If so,
we should have fought to win. If
not, then we should have with-
drawn from the War.

Mr. Nixon, with his trips to
China and the Soviet Union, has
done more, Buckley asserted, to
blunt the thrust of what he
called “responsible anti-com-
munism, not John Birch Society
stuff," than any other man in history.

On the economic front, the
author/journalist was no less
critical, calling the imposition of
wage and pflCt‘ controls a des-
pcriiti- move. The economy was
just lit-ginning in ri-ciiVi-r in mid-
1970, he claimed. whi-n Nixon
was shown ihc rl‘siilh (if the

His fiscal policies were no le-
irresponslble. Campaigning in
1988 he spoke out against extra-
vagant government spending.
Once elected, however, be
promptly ran up the largest
budget deficit in this country’s
history.

Mr. Buckley claimed that the
Presidency of Richard Nixon
will probably have a crippling
effect on the future of the con-
servative movement in America
simply because, rightly or
wrongly, Mr. Nixon is identified
by most Americans as being a
conservative. He is not, asserted
Mr. Buckley, and identifying so
incompetant a man with conser-
vatism will surely hurt real con-
servatives' chances for victory
later on. After all, said Mr.
Buckley, when conservatives say
to the voters “give us a chance,"
the public will respond “but we
already gave you a chance with
Mr. Nixon and we didn't like it."
it is, he claimed, unfortunate
that true conservatives-arc’being
saddled with so unconservaiive a
man.

Mr. Buckley spoke for approxi-
mately forty-lch minutes and
then took questions from the
floor. He then returned to the
l'lyﬂll. Housc where he was
staying and left on Wednesday
morning to speak at a college in
Missouri. “They’re really radical
