State University Chancellor Ernest Boyer is fond of eirllrrrrt st \\

Although the university administration here at Albany is our

students. We are not saying that every popular professor r

SUNYA Administration Drags Feet
on Ambulance

To the Editor.

The other day I was quietly
reflecting on my thoughts,

We all attend a university
which offers many services.
There are many extra-curricular
clubs and activities, just about
anything one could wish. But
one service, I believe, is badly
lacking, and that is an ambu—
lancu service.

We have an extremely good
and highly competent medical
staff, but there is usually a long
wait for competent emergency
first aid. We all recall when
halfback Iii-mic Boggs, during a
football game last year, was hurt
and wanted an interminable
period of time for an ambulance.

ICvr-ry timi- a serious accident
occurs it takes a minimum of
twrrnty to thirty minutes before
an ambulance arrives.

Looking anti asking around
campus to see if anyone was
intercsti-d in achieving a better
responsi- for crncrgency first aid.

I found a group of qualified
students, with an ambulance,
waiting for the administration to
give them the go ahead with a
student—run ambulance service.

These students, all emergency
medical technicians, certiﬁed by
the State of New York, have
been ready for approximately a
year.

First, the SUNY central ad-
ministration has a regulation
which says a student-run ambu-
lance serving the university is a
“no—no." Of course they turn
their backs when you mention
that Stony Brook has had an
effective student-run ambulance
service for more than a year, and
that Oswcgo also has had an
effective student-run ambulance
service for the past ten months.
Binghamton, too, recently
started student-run ambulatqu
Can Albany have a sturlI-iitruu
ambulance scrvico‘.‘ No, it isn‘t
allowed says SUNY central. ‘

The administration here on
campus hasn’t yet givun its up-

‘lt’s not the principle,
it’s the Money’

proval. Why? I don’t know and a
number of my colleagues don’t
know either, but, whatever the
reason it cannot be a very good
reason. Three colleges and possi-
bly many others have a student-
run ambulance service. So what
makes Albany different?

There are rumors that our
highly qualified medical staff
doesn't think the students can
handle the job, even though they
are certified by the State of New
York. My answvr is what make
SUNY/s students so drastically
different? They are qualified.
certified by New York State.
Somc of them arc not experi-
enced? Batoney, that‘s the old
.s'lttl‘Y"y()Il can't hich a Job un-
less you hich i-pr-rit-ncc and
you can't get r-xpcrii-ncc unless
you hth- a job. Which comes
first, the chicken or the egg?

To conclude, the beauracracy
of the two administrations?-
SUNY ccntral and SUNYAria
preventing Albany State from
getting a much needed service.
Everything is ready *qualified
personnel and an ambulance. All
that is needed is a wry stmplc
“ycs” from the Administration.
May we hear from them?
