The Final Poll

NEW YORK AP - President Nix-
on held a 26-point lead over
Democrat George McGovern
going into the last two weeks of
the presidential campaign,
according to the fourth and ﬁnal
Yankelovich poll.

The survey, commissioned
by the New York Times and
Time magazine, gave Nixon 56
per cent to 30 per cent for
McGovern and 14 per cent un-
decided. This was a 4 point gain
for McGovern over the previous
poll.

Based on the telephone inter-
views with 3,010 registered vot-
ers, the survey was conducted
from Oct. 15 to Oct. 24. It.
ended just before the ad-
ministration announced that
peace was at hand in Vietnam.

The four Yankelovich surveys
were taken in the 16 largest
states, which together have 332
electoral votes - well over the
270 that are necessary to carry
the presidency.

Survey results gave Nixon a
lead of 22 points or better in It)
states v Texas, Illinois, Indiana.
Ohio, Missouri, Pennsylvania,
North Carolina, Georgia, Vir»
ginia and Florida.

The President held a lead of

between 12 and 22 points in
New York, California, Michigan,
New Jersey and Wisconsin, the
poll said. In only one of the 16
states, Massachusetts, did
McGovern appear ahead.

The survey also showed appar-
ent growing apathy toward the
election. In the first poll last
July, 48 per cent said they were
“very interested" in the cam-
paign, but the figure fell to 39
per cent in the latest poll.

The Gallup Poll, meanwhile,
reported that it found “the
Democratic party has certain
strengths which may not be
apparent in the latest figures on
candidate preferences."

In its mid-October survey, re-
ported last week, the Gallup Poll
found Nixon ahead by a 23
point margin, 59 per cent to 36
per cent for McGovern.

But when the voters were
asked which political party they
thought best able to deal with
the nations's problems, the GOP
was ahead only 55 to lb per
cent, Gallup said Sunday.

Democrats emerged ahead of
Republicans, 51 to 49, on ques-
tions designed to test enthusiasm
and by one per centage point in
the campaign activity, the survey
found.

Where ‘ Did Reality 60?

News Analysis
by Robert Mayer

Somewhere amid the barrage
of cliches, Madison Avenue hard-
ware, and everyday stimuli, reali-
ty gets lost.

It gets lost on page 83 of the
New York Times, it gets lost on
the 7 o'clock news, it gets lost in
a bar in Anytown USA. and it’s
almost as if it never existed at
all.

The reality that is America
today is perfectly and justly
exemplified in the President
himself. Richard Mihouse Nixon
is just what we need to help us
forget that our neighbors’ kids
are full of pot and heroin, and
that our kids must be subjected
to these vile users.

“The President is going to stop
the flow of drugs into this coun-
try.,.he told us himself in a
special brondcast to the people
on nationwide television.”

Richard Nixon tells American
that the bum who held you up
last week is going to be locked
up and society will be once and
for all safe from the criminals.
“Nixon has sure got those crimi-
nals running scared because he's
tough and no bleeding heart
liberal."

And then there is the Nixon
who ended the war because “no
one wants war,..we don't want
to see our allies threatened with
those communists and their
bloodbaths, I mean he has
stopped the draft and well we
can't just leave our POW's."

Time and place to be announced.

And of course “Nixon has
made miracles with Red China
and the Soviet Union. He has
furthered the goals of world
peace." It just isn’t “those com-
mics" the “red menace” or "the
only good commie is a dead
commie" when it comes to
$$$$$$$. Now it's all legitimate
free enterprise for the sake of
enhancing world peace.

Then we have to remember the
Richard Nixon who has put to
rest our most heartfelt fears that
those boys who did not do their
duty to their country and es-
caped to Canada will never be
granted amnesty. "Why should
those bums who were yellow
cowards be allowed to come
back to this great nation when
my son went over there and did
his service (aside: killing gooks)
for his country?"

And there is the Richard
Nixon who knows that the
American way to deal with the
Watergate bugging is pretend it
never existed. Why apologizu for
it or wish it never happened
when for all intents and pur-
poses you can believe it never
occurred.

Daily, the newspapers haw:
another story about some scan-
dal or some swindle, If it isn’t
about wheat deals it's about
putting bugs in every American
home. If it isn't about some
individual linking the White
House closer to Watergate it is
some millionaire politician giving
some millionaire friends some
