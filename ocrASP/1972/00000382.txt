Young View of Washington

The Men Behind Nixon

WASHINGTON—In one way-
re-elected or not. and like it. or
not—Richard Nixon will surely
be remembered as one of the
most effective Presidents since
Roosevelt.

In four years he has (1) ap‘
parenily come very Close to
achieving peace of his sort in the
Vietnam conﬂict which has
plagued this country for twelve
years; (2) thawed relations with
Red China, America's bitierest
and most feared enemy for the
last. quarter of a century; and (3)
at the same time cased tensions
with Russia, whose leaders aren't
even speaking with the Chiiwse,
and who, along with Lhi- Chi-
nese, have been directly aiding
the North Vietnamese.

Those three accomplishments
in themselves mark Nixon as it
man of considerable talent, ti
diplomat in be reckoned with in
the affairs of the world.

On the other hand, Nixon has
proved astonishingly inept here
at home. He has cloistcrcd him-
self in the White House, sur-
rounded by one of the most
brazen and high’handcd collec-
linn 0f knuckle-heads, klulzes
and even crooks to be assembled
at one time in the White House
in this century And what is
equally remarkable, he refuses to
rid himself of the bums, even
when faced with irrefutable evi-
dence of their disservice to him
and in the democratic process.

Less fortunate still, the Presi-
dent‘s poor judgment about per
sonal tidvisors cxtcnds as well Lo
his choices for judges and cabi-
net members, for he has:

appointed ll Cblcf Justice of
the Supreme Court who zip
piirenlly tries to tell the Speaker

of the House of Representatives
what. laws should and should not.
be passed.

-appoini.ed a Secretary of
Agriculture who wihin months
after his confirmation perpeA
traced the Great. Grain Robbery
of all time, and exhibited his
scorn for the small farmers
whose interests he is supposed Ln
represent,

mappoinled a Secretary of
Commerce, now his campaign
finance chairman, who collects
millions of dollars from undis~
closed sources, funnels thous-
ands through obscure Mexican
bank accouan and defunct curs
poralions, supports i! spy opera-
tion from a small fortune
stashed in his office safe, and has
the unmitigated gall to maintain
that the whole affair is com-
pletely proper.

The mind boggles. Washington
hasn't witnessed anything like it
since Ulysses S. Grant floun~
dered in the near total corrup-
tion of his staff and friends 100
years ago. But the country rc-
clecled Grant, and Nixon, with a
25 point. lead, seems headed
toward his four more years as
well.

If so, we can only hope he will
have the good sense to cleun
house after the victory cult-bra-
tion is over, and find some iid'
visors who will help him devote
serious, innovative attention In
the problems herrl at home
which have gone begging for the
last decade.

But it's ti hollow ltopc, :.ul
voiced with much assuredncss,
for the only people who seem to
have Mr. Nixon’s car are those
who ought to be kicked out im
theirs.

Gay Consciousness Raising:

 

Shouting Won't Help

by Mary Guhin
SUNYA Gay Alliance

Repercussions from the “tea-
room" column have run from
official dismay, particularly on
the part. of the Community Rela-
tions Office, to small town up-
roar. An acquaintance who sent.
the column home to lilillale the
folks in a small town near
Rochester reports that. due to
the wide circulation if. received
there, the guidance department
of the local high school is revis-
ing its at him of SUNYA. Ron-
nie's mat. rial in general has
Caused reactions ranging from
the amused disbelief of Jon
Guttman to the outrage of ti
significant section of the gay
community. The letter following
the first column was only the tip
of that. reaction. Just. for the
record, we felt primarily that the
column was too personal; the
title was pejorative and a lapse
of judgment on the part of the
ASP; and that the content con-
tributed too much to stereo-
typical ideas about. Gays. Parli-
cularly objectionable was the im'
pression conveyed that imper-
sonal sex in public places is an
exclusively Gny phenomenon.
According to Laud Humphrey's

jack anderson

research, summarized in his
book, TEAROOM TRADE, a
significant portion of those men
who seek out this kind of sexual
contact. are not. men with a
homosexual self-concept. Many
are men who feel they need a
sexual outlet in addition to their
marriage; who are unable or un-
willing to invest personal re-
sources in an additional relation-
ship. Our point. here is not. to
defend or condemn anyone, but
merely to clarify.

We (yawn) decent homo‘
sexuuls thought that the column
should be educational if it is
going to exist. Which in all pro
bability means that it will not be
as much fun to send home to
your mother. We suspect this is
so because the truth about gay
folks is never so entertaining and
comforting as the myths and
misconceptions. (See excollenl
article in Tues. ASP 10/31). It's
easy to be certain that you
would not hire, house, or be-
friend, lct alone love, u freak in
Saran Wrap and bug-eye Foster
Grants. It is much harder to
know that we are, by and large,
indistinguishable from Dick 8:
Jane. Many Gays cling to that
protectivo anonymity in fear of
the consequences of being them-

Chill in U.S.-China Relations

Washington—*Warming Chinese
-American relations, which wea-
thered the bombing and mining
of Noth Vietnam's supply lines,
are chilling again.

The interception of Chinese
shipments, according to u CIA
report, has soured U.S. relations
with mainland China.

The repurl. reveals that Chinese
l'rcighteis uri» successfully un~
landing an astonishing amount
of supplies at hidden anchorages
up nnd down the North Vietnam
coast.

The supplies are unluudcd on
small burgers and boats, which
smuggle thc war booty Inshore.
’l‘he ingenious Chinese, we have
learned, even use huge water
proof plastic bugs in floul. sup-
plica ashore.

'I‘o disrupt l-lunol's aupplylinc,
Llic U.S. SchmllI Fleelhua inLer~
cepled somc Chinese shipping.
But such ucllnn, according to
the CIA, bus only prompted llw
Chinese to renew their pledges
of support of North Vietnam

THE LANSKY MEMOS—

WAHSING’I‘ON—The U.S. Jus-
tice Dept. secretly furnished Is-
rael with Internal Revenue and
Immigration Servica memos to
help convince Israeli uulhorlties
to deport aging crime lord, Mey-
er Lunsky.

Lansky tried to take advantage
of Israel’s strong refugee law,
which offers it home to all Jew-
ish refugees. But the Israeli au—
thorities decided thiil the law
was not intended to protect fugi-
tivus from Justice. Lunsky has
been given it one-way ticket back
to the United States, where he
facets fudcriil charges.

Among the U.S. documents
supplied to the Israelis was an
Immigration Scrvtcc memo link-
ing Lunsky Lu _t.he notorious
gangster "Bugs" Sicgcl.

The memo quotes tin Informer
nutncd Benjamin Baron b5 saying
that Ltinsky “was cu-leuder with
Bugs Siegel of LI gang employed
as ‘protaclionlal' of ii bootleg-
ging combine and...wua involved
in murder Llnd kidnapping."

A memo from the Internal
Revenue Service summed up
Lanaky’s career In these wordil:
“Initittlty’ii history shows that. he

won closely associated, both per-
