Billy the Kid Was a Punk

by Pam & Michael Rosenthal

Alternative Features Service

If, by some chance, the legend
of Billy the Kid occupies a cher-
ished place in your heart, you
might find Dirty Little Billy an
intriguing picture. Other than
flaying a singularly dead
horse—the nobility of the Old
West—ii. does not have much to
recommend it.

Even the advertising slo-
gan—“Billy the Kid was a
punk"—is a gross overstatement.
The word punk implies a surly
street arrogance that is entirely
missing in Michael J, Pollurd's
whiney, dreary, hollow-eyed
portrayal. It would have been
more representative of the film
to proclaim, "Billy the Kid was a
clod."

We approached the film with
some trepidation, knowing that
its writers, director and pro
ducers were all employed by the
same advertising agency, hereto-
fore famous for painting Braniff
airplanes pink and crushing Ben-
son & Hedges cigarettes against
windows and between elevator
doors. Faced with this unprece»
dented incursion of advertising
into filmmuking, we anticipated
something sinister and threaten-
ing-‘pre-fuhricated entertain

Records:

ment with an insidious hold over
the lower reaches of the imagina-
tion.

As it. turns out, the ﬁlm could
have desperately used some of
the compulsive, attention-getting
energy that is presently going
into the promotional campaign,
complete with Billy the Kid but-
tons and hats. Dirty Little Billy
is a long, wandering, painfully
amateurish ﬁlm, filled with re-
spect for the film-as-art, and a
touching enthusiasm for some
adolescent ideal of "realism," as
though the authors had but re-
cently discovered that the Old
West. was it brutal, dismal place,
and cannot restrain their eager-
ness to share the exciting news

It might have been possible to
develop a physical style to sug-
gest the grinding deadening ted-
ium of town life in the West; but
the ad‘agency habit of postcard
pietorialism proved too strong to
break. Everything glistens all the
time. Mud shines steel-blue on
people's foreheads; the stained
and tattered walls are so eye--
catching as to suggest a lucrative
line of stainaind-tattcr wall-pa-
per. Each rise and .s'el. of the sun
is attended with such mechanical
grandeur that you expect a new
Ctimaro to appear over the hori-
zon at any minute.

The plot is pretty minimal,

FRIDAY NOWEMBER 3, 1972

most probably because of some
ambition that this ﬁlm avoid the
“sterotyped” and the "obvious."
It does. Very little is obvious
except that. Billy Bonney runs
away from his parente‘ home-
stead and moves in with Berle
and Goldie, town whore and
gambler. Exactly why he does
so, or why anybody does any-
thing, is not so obvious, and not.
even very clear.

We spend the whole time wat-
ching Billy hang around the su-
loon, alternately bitching, sulk-
ing, and looking pre-occupied by
inner struggle, while we wait for
him to start doing anything,
even killing people, if that is the
most interesting thing he can
come up with. When Billy does
make his first kills, and some-
thing approaching a gleam creeps
into his eyes, the film seems
about ready to get underway,
just in time for the closing cre-
dits.

As the film meandeer along,
the only thing that engaged our
attention was watching Pollard,
already well into his thirties,
attempt to portray Billy at age
16 (remember that Billy the Kid
died when he was 21), That
Pollard has always been typed
for juvenile roles because of his
persistent bahyfnt and simple-
minded facial expression can be
seen as a reflection of the cu|~
ture's hostility towards adoles-
cents. Pollurd‘s attempt to iiiimc
youthful gangliness anti (ton-
fusion winds up looking like
mental retardation if not. out
right decay. The effect
incongruous that it is hard to
shaki- the impression that Billy is
older than anyone else in the
cast, including his parents

Next to patent insincerity, the
most, damaging Lhing one can
bring to a film project is the
sincere desire to be an Artist,
unzimomponied by anything in
particular to say. With its aching
purity of intention, reminiscent
of highsclionl literary magazines,
and overwhelmed by a million
dollar plus budget, I)irl_v Lillie
