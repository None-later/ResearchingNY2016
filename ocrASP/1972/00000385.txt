Face lift for House?

WASHINGTON AP — The
Nov. 7 elections promise the
House a new look if not an
ideological shift: younger, pos»
sibly 100 new faces, more Re-
publicans and several new blacks
and women.

Reports from Associated Press
newsmen across the country also
show the new 18 year old col»
lege vote is a factor in at least six
House races.

Strategists for both parties
agree the Republicans will pick
up new Seats, the Republicans
counting on a net gain of 26-
short of the Ill needed to take
House control away from the
Democrats.

Democrats figure the Republi-
cans will gain 12 to 15 more
seats unless a landslide vote for
President Nixon carries in more
on his coattails.

Republicans expect to win i;
new seats in the South and
strengthen the Republican-
Southern Democrat coalition
that guides House action on such
ideological issues as defense,
government spending, special
programs and busing,

The AI’ newsman report two
black women appear to have
elections cinchcd. They are
Yvoniii- Brathwaiti- Burke, Dr
(,‘alil'., cochairman of the Demo»
cratic National Convention. and
state Sen. Barbara Jordan, i)
'i‘cx

The only other woman with
that good a position out of 59
running is Elizabeth Holtzmaii,
i)-N.Y,. who unscatcd Judiciary

Chairman Emanuel Ccller, dean
of the House, in the primary.

Women also have a chance of
winning new seats in Maryland
and Colorado.

Two other blacks given a
chance of winning out of the 39
running are the Rev. Andrew J.
Young of Atlanta, Ga., and State
Sen, J.O. Pattersor Jr., of Mem-
phis'l‘enn.

The AP newsmen report the
impact of the new 18 year old
college vote is largely unmea-
sured even by candidates who
pin their hopes or fears on it.
One question is whether stu—
dents will vote in college towns
or back home.

Candidates who could be hurt
by a large student turnout in-
clude Fred Schwcngcl, Jr.-iowa,
Charles E Chamberlain. R-
Mich., Marvin It. Esch, it-Mich.,
John M. Zwach, R»Minn., Earl F.
Landgrebc, it‘lnc” and John '1'.
Myers, R-Inc,

The Constitution precludes
anyone under 25 from running
for the House but ncariy a dozen
candidates are under an.

The prospect of as many as
100 new faces in the 435 mem-
ber house doesn‘t mean voters
want to throw that malty out.

Some 57 of [be new incmhers
will replace scnior congressmen
not running for rc-clcction be»
cause of heavy retirements, rc-

districting and primary defeat.

Beyond the 57 dropouts,
congressional elections every
two years normally bring in Kit)
to 50 new members,

Nixon Addresses The Nation

by Gaylord Shaw
Associated Press Writer
Washington Ai’ President
Nixon said Thursday night “we
are ready to conclude" a Viet-
nam pi-acc settlement but “We
are not going to allow an elec-
tion deadline to force us into an
agreement which would he only
a temporary truce and not a
lasting peace."

in his first nationally tt’lt‘VlSl‘d
political broadcast of the canr
puign, Nixon (li‘clai'i-d “we arc
going tmign the agreement when
the agreement is right. not one
day before -- and when the
agreement is right. we are going
to sign, without one day‘s de-
lay."

“We have reached a substati-
tial agreement on most of the
settlement." Nixon said. “The
settlement We are ready to con-
clude would accomplish the
basic objectives" he presented
on May it:

A return of all prisoners of
war. “a ceasefire- throughout iii-
iiochina" and the right of the

South Vietnamese to determine
their own future “without
having a communist government
or a coalition government im»
post-d on them against their
will."

Without giving details, Nixon
said “there are still some issues
to be resolved..."

Nixon said he has insistcd that
these issues be settled before the
agreement is singed, adding
“that is why we refused to be
stampcdcd into meeting the ar-
bitrary deadline of October
Jilst.”

This was a reference to
Hanoi's contention that the
Unili-(l States had agreed to sign
a Vietnam settlement pact by
that date.

The Iiiiic~point agreement dis-
closed by Hanoi makes no refer-
t‘tlt‘l‘ to an indochina-wuii‘. cease
l'ire. Rather, it says “24 hours
after the signing of the agree-
ment, a ('l‘itb't‘ l'irI’ shall be ob-
served throughout South Vici-
niim.”

The nine-point draft agree—
ment disclosed by Hanoi also
says that all foreign troops
would be withdrawn from Cam-
bodia and Laos and that military
activities in those two countries
would end.

in his tapedvin-advance tele-
vision address, Nixon said some
are asking “Why worry about
the details?" He provided his
own answer.

“We are not going to repeat
the mistake of lutih when the
bombing halt agreement was
rushed into just before an elec‘
tion without pinning down the
details.

"Wc want peace -- peace with
honor -« a peace fair to all and a
peace that will last. That is why
i am insisting that the central
points he clearly settled, so that
there Will be no misunder-
standing which could lead to a
breakdown of the settlement
and a resumption of the war."

"1 am confident that we will
soon achieve that goal,"

The President told the voters
that “the leaders in Hanoi will
be watching" the results of next
Tuesday's elections.

“They will be watching for
the answer of the American
[)cupic.,.to this question: shall
We havu peace with honor or
peace with surrender?"

“Always in the past." Nixon
said, “you have answch 'peacc
with honor' and by giving tlial
same answer once again on Nov.
7 you can help make certain that
peace With honor can now be
achieved."

Nixon referred in his 2t
niiiiulc address to his Journeys
this year to i’I-king and Moscow.
He said his “injur goal in a
second term Is “to complI-lc the
foundations for a world iit
peace-so that the next genera
tion can be the first in this
century to live Without war. and
Without fear of war."

Turning to domestic issues,
Nixon repeated his nirnvw-laxes
pledge and said one of his top
priorities III a si-t‘tilid lt‘rlti would
be to curb the growth of the
federal government by shifting
more responsibility and power
back to state and local governv
nieiits.
