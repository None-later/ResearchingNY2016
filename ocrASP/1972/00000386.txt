if McG Support Urged

by Diane M. Cyganovich

The campaign for President
draws to a close. Four more days
and the nation will know the
results of years of work. Some
will cry for‘joywthers will tweep
in sorrow. In American politics,
as elsewhere, not everyone can
shout Victoriously. All the-statis-
tics point toward a Nixon win.
Yet, many McGovern supporters
ﬁght on with hope. The predict-
ion polls have been wrong be-
fore.

Supporters here on campus
differ little from those in other
places with one major exception.
Here the campaign faces a most
feared evil: Apathy with a cap-
ital A. Students for McGovern,
where are you? At the beginning
of the year 400 students vol-
unteered. Presently 100-150
work daily to further the
campaign, Most average 3-5
hours a week.

Does this mean that SUNYA
students are anti-McGovern? The
leaders here do not think this
the case. They believe that the
majority of students identify
with MCGchrn and will vote for
him. Why, then, are there so few
students activer participating in
the campaign"

Two reasons often given in
clude studies and lack of cam»

 

university co

paign excitement. School studies
limit the amount of time avbil-
able for extra projects. Also
there is little excitement in the
issum of the campaign. Vietnam
has quieted down and all other
major issues involve many im-
plications not easily seen by the
public. Because many students
do not fully understand various
issues, goes the argument, they
cannot get excited about them.

The campaign leaders here at
SUNYA believe that outside of
Vietnam, the corruption of the
Nixon administration and the
inconsistent stands taken by
McGovern are the two major
issues. Within the next few days
they feel reports concerning
corruption in the administration
as well as those about the con-
troversy of the Vietnam peace
proposals will not die but in-
crease.

When McGovern's campaign
inconsistencies are weighed
against these reports, McGovern
supporters see little doubt about
the outcome. If students act. as
pectcd, they will vote after coni-
paring Nixon Willi McGoVi-rn,
not McGovern With himself.
According to the organizers of
the McGoVern campaign this will
mean- victory for the Democrats.

Although the turnout for cam-
paign workers has been lower
than expected the monetary
contributions have been good.
The McGovern table in the Cam-
pus ()entulm- collected about
$350. Also through various
other activities $400 has been
raised. These events included a
Charlie Chaplin movie, the satir-
ical documentary of Nixon-
Milhouse, a party at Henways, a
beer blast and a guest speaker—
Allard Lowenstein. Most of
these activities received student
support.

From now until Tuesday more
important and interesting events
are planned. Tonight at 8:00ini
LC 23 a play, "Once to Every
Man and Nation," starring Piper
Laurie will be performed. The
Academy Award nominee, Piper
Laurie, makes this well worth
the 50 cents admission. Also
throughout the weekend there
will be a canvassing of all the
suburban areas.

Finally we have the activities
of election day. Busses will leave
from the circle to McGovern
headquarters starting at 8 a.m.
and ending at 7 p.m. Phone
canvassing will be done to re-
mind all registered Democrats to
vote. Baby sitters and drivers
will be needed. Students will act
as poll watchers and hand out
leaflets. There will also be a need
for people to work with the
sound truck.

The organizers are hoping for
500 volunteers. The need is
great. If you want further in
formation or would like to vol-
unteer please call 10517224 or
McGoVern headquarters,

CINCINNATI, Ohio AP - Sen.
George McGovern campaigned
through the Midwest Thursday
promising higher income for
farmers and saying he wouldn’t
let Saigon‘s ‘.‘lit.tle dictator," as
he called President Nguyen Van
Thieu, stand in the way of 9983‘“:
in Vietnam.

The Democratic presidential
nominee also said he thinks
hecklers who shouted and blew
whistles at Vice President Spiro
T. Agnew in San Diego Wednes-
day were planted by Republi-
cans “to make us look bad." He
added, “If ever I saw a put-up
deal, that was it."

The candidate, accompanied
by his wife Eleanor, made tele-
vision and radio appearances in
Chicago, spoke to an estimated
8,000 students and faculty at
the University of Cincinnati, and
headed for Battle Creek, Mich.
for another television appear-
ance,

McGovern repeated, in a tele—
vision broadcast for Illinois and
Missouri, that he does not think
it is his responsibility to try to
rally the country behind a
second Nixon administration if
he loses the election.

But he said “1 don't intend to
lose this election."

“I don‘t think it's my respon-
sibility to try to rally the people
behind policies that I disagree
with," McGovern said “There's
something more important than
unity. 'I‘here's the importance of
the truth, There's the impor
tance of this country laCing up

to its real problems...the corrupt
and dishonest practices of this
administration...of keeping the
pressure on until the war ends."

In a radio address recorded in
Chicago and played later in the
day on the CBS radio network,
McGovern said President Nixon's
farm policies have caused
150,000 farms to shut down and
forced one million people to flee
rural areas.

He reaffirmed promises to ap—
point a “working farmer" as
secretary of Agriculture, lower
property taxes, and take action
to raise farm income to 90
percent of parity, the theoretical
measure of fair farm prices.
Aides acknowledged this prob-
ably would cause an increase in
grocery prices.

At the University of Cincin-
nati, McGovern spoke in an
echoing concrete fieldhouse
nearly filled to its 8,200 capa-
city. Sprinkled through the au-
dience were some who held aloft
about half-dozen Nixon banners
and sporadically heckled Mc-
Govern with prcrNixon slogans.

McGovern, still a bit hoarse
despite a regimen of honey and
tea to treat his campaign-
strained vocal chords, said Presi-
dent Thieu is threatening to veto
a peace settlement in Vietnam.

At a telethon appearance
during the morning in Chicago,
McGovern called 'I‘hieu a “little

called him a “brutal and corrupt

The Third Porties...And Their Candidates 9

by Lee Byrd
Associated Press Writer

Washington -- Richard Nixon
and George McGovern are agreed
that they offer “the clcamst
choice of this century" in presi—
dential politics. Linda Jenness
and John Schmitz are agreed
that that's hogwash.

After all, says Mrs. Jenness,
the Democrats and Republicans
are no more than "Capitalist
Party No. 1 and Capitalist Party
No. 2."

Schmitz sees a similarity, but
says the Democrats are “Social-
ist Party A," and the Republi—
cans are “Socialist Party B.”

Mrs. Jenness and Schmitz are
two of this year's presidential
candidates. For voters with un~
common political appetites,
there is not only a choice but a
plethora of presidential entrees
on next week‘s election menu.

Granted. McGovern and
Nixon are, in the idiom of 1972,
the only “viable” candidates.
And certainly they're the only
ones with the cash to promote
their soupboxes like soapl'lakes,

But while the two-party sys»
tem is under far less stress than

it was four years ago — when
George Wallace won five states
and 9 million votes * there is

nonetheless an abundance of al-
ternatives, provided you don't
mind spending a vote on a man
who can't win,

Third parties and offbeat can-
didates have been part of the
(li-inoncralic stew ever since the
Quiils of Jefferson's day, though
few baVe surVived more than a
generation and most less than
that.

Those in this year's crop may
not be as colorful as, say, the
Loeofocos, the Goodies, the
Bucklails and llunkers of times
past. Bill their names may be the
most pretentious on record.

Consider, for example, the
Universal Party, whose univer-
salily has brought ballot recogni-
tion for nominee (iiibriel (ireen

the Communhit Party.

Schmitz holds the American
Party banner vaunted by Wallace
because the country “needs a
man who puts America ﬁrst."
But the America First Party has
a candidate of its own, John V.
Mahalchik. At best, Mahalchik
would have to settle for New
Jersey first, since that is the only
state where he is (in the ballot.

Schmitz, who is running for
president after having been
dumped in his California con-
gressional primary, appears the
leader in the third-party race for
ballot listings. His name could
appear in 34 states, though sev-
eral are tentative due to legal
entanglements.

The People's Party now claims
certification in 10 states, and
Linda Jenness may appear as the
nominee of the Socialist Workers
Party in 20. Both parties are
pursuing court actions aimed at
expanding those numbers.

The Socialist Workers Party
has the distinction of two presi-
dential nominees - both
women. Evelyn Reed is a stand-
in for Mrs. Jenness in New York,
Indiana and Wisconsin because
of constitutional questions over
age. Mrs. Jenness is only 31,
whereas the Constitution puls
the minimum at 35. The SWI’
argues, however, that the 20th
Amendment empowers Congress
to waive the requirement, and
most states apparently agree.

The SoCialist Labor Party can-
didate, Lou1s Fisher, is on the
ballot in at least eight states, and
the perennial entry for the Com-
munist Party, Gus llall, lists 13.
Libertarian candidate John
llospers is certified in two states
and hopes for five by election
day

Here is a brief look at some iif
these lesser‘known candidates
and their ideas.

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1972

calls himself the “Adlai Steven-
son of the right." A favorite: “I
did not oppose President
Nixon‘s trip to Peking. Only his
trip back." Playing on the simi-
larity between his name and a
popular beer, his bumper stic-
kers proclaim: “When you’re out
of Schmitz, you’re out of gear."

Schmitz sums up his platform
in two lines: ‘Domestic policy -
those who work should live
better than those who won't.
Foreign Policy - Don't go to
war unless you intend to win."

He says Nixon has sold out
socialism at a time when Ameri-
ca is a target of international
conspiracy. And “Any govern-
ment that's big enough to give
you everything you want is big
enough to take away everything
you 've got,"

Dr. Benjamin Spock

People's Party: “I‘m indebted
to the Johnson Administration,"
says the one-time baby doctor,
“for giving me an entirely new
and important career." Indeed,
Spock now devotes full atten-
tion to his role an elder states-
man of anti-war activism.

Spock outs an incongruous
figure among the ranks of the
New Left. He wears line blue
suits With vest and tie, a pocket
handkerchief and a gold walcli
chain. His hair is Wlllll' and
grows ever thinner, but he is
taiiiied and .spry at age litl
reflecting an enthusiasm foi
physical fitness which dates back
to his Olympic rowing days in
the 1920's

A visitor to more than 200
colleges campuses in the past
four years and a veteran of
Washington demonstrations,
Spock iii lli7l inherited the
reins of what began in l‘JliH as
the Peace and [freedom Party.

Many of the party's former
advocates now are in (icorge
McGovern's camp. but Spock
says “you waste your vote by
voting for Democrates or llepulr
Iicaiis. The rich and powerful
control bolli parties."

Still, he admits, “il's going to
take a long time" to build an
independent movement

Linda lenness

Socialist Worker's Party: A
one-time Washington secretary
and then schoolteacher in Spain,
Mrs. Jenness was enchanted by
the Cuban revolution and joined
the Young Socialist \lliance in
1966. She was born in El Reno,
Okla, but has lived in Georgia
most of her life — and in 1969
ran as the SW? Candidate for
mayor of Atlanta. A year later,
she ran for governor.

She has traveled in several
Latin American countries, in-
cluding a visit to Cuba at Fidel
Castro's invitation.

Mrs. Jenness calls for in “dem-
ocratic society where the people
who live and work in it make the
decisions." And that, she adds,
means “taking control of society
out of the hands of ii minority
of millionaires...and reorganizing
production" with nationaliza-
tion.

She refuses to designate either
Nixon or McGovern as “the
lesser of two evils" because “the
lesservcvil policy is a dead—end
road." She knows she'll lose, but
expects “to see a Socialist
America in my life-time."

J. Edgar Hoover called him “a

foe of Americanism."

The party's long-time general
secretary and a veteran would-be
candidate, Hall, at 62, says he'll
be happy “if I can beat out the
other leftist parties.”

His platform, he says, does
not. advocate communism, and
indeed, there are only three
planks: an end to the Vietnam
war and dismantling of the De-
fense establishment: a "massive
assault" on poverty, including a
$6,500 income for a family of
four; and elimination of racism.

John Hospers

Libertarian Party: The 54-
year-old chairman of the Univer-
sity of Southern California's
philosophy department is run-
ning for an office he doesn't
want to hold, for leadership of a
government he hopes will shrink
away.

Libertarians, simply, believe
in the least government possible.
“Each individual has the right to
exercise sole dominion over his
own life so long as he does not
forcibly interfere with the equal
rights of others," says the party
platform.

Willi that, llospcrs adovates
amnest for draft evaders, legali‘
moon of marijuana, the right to
bear arms, and strong pollution
controls. lle opposes public
schools, government economic
controls, censorship and welfare
programs.

“Our party is no more right
iliaii left," he says. “Conserva-
Iivcs rim very high on economic
freedom and very low on politi-
cal freedom. Liberals are very
high on political freedom but
very low on economic freedom.
We run very high on both."

Some would call it a mixture
of laisse'l. faire economics, avanle
garde morality and Jefferson's
suspicion of gowrni'nenl.
