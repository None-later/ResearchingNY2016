Grid Picks

by the Blonde Bombshell

DENVER vs. NEW YORK—If
Denver had a quarterback to go
with Floyd Little the Giants
would be in trouble. Without,
the Giants get an easy one to
rebound with.

WASHINGTON vs. JETS—-
Giants couldn’t stop Brown nel-
ther will the Jets. Kilmer, a ﬁne
quarterback, but _no Jurgenaon.
Namath, if he  blocking,
should have enough'.“t '
Redskins. '  ~

  

ATLANTA vs.’ [memoir

Gabriel is not the oldgG’abriel.
Defense looked bad verslis Oak-
land but so did Atlanta‘s. Atlanta
with a win moves into first.
Atlanta will squeak by.

CHICAGO vs. DETROIT—
Detroit is angry at Butkus and
their play will show it. Landry
to best Douglas in the battle of
running quarterbacks. Chicago
three game winning streak to
end.

CINNCINNATI Vs. PITTS-
BURGH—A battle for the top
spot in AFC Central. Paul Brown
is looking for a championship

o» upset.

but he will be denied as
Bradshaw leads Pittsburgh to

wm.

DALLAS Vs. SAN DIEGO-
Defense is still a key and Dallas
owns a superior one. San Diego
could use Thomas but he won’t
be there. Staubach is ready if
needed, but Dallasi shouldn’t
need him.

MIAMI vs. BUFFALO—Miami
still undefeated edged Buffalo

‘two weeks ago. It won’t be as

close even without Griese.
Simpson won’t have a field day
against the ‘fno-name” defense.

OAKLAND vs. KANSAS
CITY—The rivalry continues.
K.C. always seems to wiq the big
ones and Oakland and Lamonica
seem to lose them. If Lamonica
goes bomb happy it will be easy
for K0,. if not K.C. will win via
Stenerud's toe.

SAN FRANCISCO vs.
GREENBAYMThe pack is back,
but Scott Hunter is not Bart
Starr. Spiirriei' or Brodie can
lead 49ch to win.

supreme Court Works With SA

By Ellyn Slernberger

Courts are traditionally the
least known and understood
branch of government. Their
mysterious nature results from
the conditions of their opera-
tion. There is little or no
communication between the
people and their courts.

The Student Association Su-
preme Court is no exception.
This body of students. ap-
pointed by the President of SA
and approved by Central Coun-
cil, has no means of communi-
cation with the rest of the stu-
dent body until they actually
hear and decide a case. Chief
Judge Ted Salem feels that a
basic lack of continuity such as
is found in the Council or the.
Executive branch is one of the
reasons for the court's sh rouded
presence. “The court only meets
when needed. We don’t meet as
a group unless there's a case
present or we have to decide
whether we have to hear a case."

Even though the court is little
seen or heard it does serve some
important functions within the
Student Association. Salem says,
“The purpose really is to act as
an arbiter between the powers,
an arbiter between the President
and the Council to keep every-
body in line and to make sun-
they don’t do something Ihcy'rc
not designated to do. It also
serves as a laison betwvcn iiidi
viduals and the Student Associa~
tion that we have here." Salem
feels, "there is no way a student
could approach the Central
Council and really be heard. It's
very difficult to do that . .. If
it's an unconstitutional question,
he obviously can't ask the (foun-
cil to renege on it. So he has to
come to us."

Constitutionally, there is no
limit to the number of judges on
the court, but presently there
are six: Ted Salem, i’eii-r
Coughlin, Rich Wright, llicli
Matsil, Doug Kern, and Jay
Fisher. The last four abch
judges have been on the court
for about two weeks. Salem has
been on for one year, andin that
time has sat in on only four
cases. He says that the court has
heard only a handful of cases in
the past six years and usually
about two cases a year.

Despite the small number of
cases. Salem has found they can
classified into obvious cata

gories. "Cases we’ve board since
around 1966 have definitely
been cases relating to the power
of SAW designate money. For
example the Washington bus
case where the court allowed the
Central Council to authorize
funds to send groups to Washing-
ton. “Another major aspect of
our cases," Salem continued, “is
elections. People are always pr0‘
testing elections. For instanCE.
Myskania. We had a referral for
that last year and there are
about three cases on file about
it. . . We also handled the
case last year of Nydia Rivera
protesting the elections. . , There
are also cases about what an
agency of (.‘enlral Council can
do and not do. For example.
WSUA had a casu a couple of
years ago
power."
Salcni says that most of the
cast-s brought to the Supreme
('ourt are initiated by indiVIdiial
students. The procedure for this
is very Simple. One need only go
to the Student Association of
fice and ask the secretary for a
referral form. The compli-led
form is sent to Salt-m who asks
the judges if they want to hear
the case. If they do, a date for
the hearing |\ established at the
most ('()1l\'l'llll'lll llllil'. The court
doesn't he." l‘\t'l_\ l‘ilM‘ lllill is
brought up Salt-in pointed out
that, “if Iln-rc is ti ('i|\i' llllilii)

in our iiiri~iliclioii Ilii-n Wc llil\i'
llIl' option iiol lo hear it. Ever)

regarding ihi-ir

Salem feels that one of the
cause» of Lhi- courts almost
anonymous i-Xisli-ni'i' is lliill
pcoplc :iri- not aware of it. “The
major piolilr-in is that people
just don't l't‘illllA‘ that the court
is available to them to appeal
lo." Other than letting students
know that the court cXists there
really is no way for them to get

Salem says. "Actually the only
students 1 see who can piirtii'i
pair on the i-ourl arc the llll'lll
lit-rs of 11 Mi-inlii-rship is open to
the students ill the bcgiiining ol
the semi-slur "

In every government, there are
certain relationships between the
branches. Salem commented on
the court‘s relation to the
Executive branch of SA. “We
have an obviously close relation
with Mike Lamperf! because
he appointed us. He respects us;
we respect him. We act as a
Check on him just as we would
act as a check on any legislature.
. . That's about as far as it goes
aside from maintaining a certain
rapport between the president
and the judges.

Salem explains last year's
EXecutive-Court troubles:
“There were three or four mem-
bers on the court in the begin-
ning of the semester and Mike . .
. did not appoint new members
until December. By the time
that came about [Chief Judge]
(,‘url Stcvonson was obvioust
fed up Willi the court and lost
enthusiasm for it. It |thc court]
just never got off the ground."
Hall-iii feels that “this left a
bitter Iibll' in cwrybody's
month about the (‘ourt and of
course the relationship with the
I‘iXl't'lIllH' l‘lyi-ryiine li-cls now
that we are hostili- ltl Mike or
that we are his lackii-s because
its one iir the other. it was ii
mess last year. I don't think
We'll see a repeat this year."

As for the legislatch branch,
Salem “would like to see [itj

llli'lll. Not that Michael (lomi
