Continuing with layout, Mr.
'l‘isdale was asked why the Gym
in so far removed from the rest
of the Campus. His reply was
purely logical. If a line is drawn
around the outside of each
Quad. a large square results with
the Podium neatly in the center.
This is the socailed Academic
Area. The Planners did not led
the Physical Education, the
lnfirmary or the Services
Buildings should be within the
Academic Area. Further, it en-
»ables the Gym to be the hub of a
wheel with the tennis courts,
football and soccer ﬁelds, and
varsity field totally surrounding
it. Merely a matter of practi-
cality.

What of the parking lots which
are under heated debate right
n o w '2 Mr. Tisdale answered
simply that distance is a very
relative term. Using the same
Hypothetical Academic Area,
the Planners did not want the
pollution and congestion of
automobile trafﬁc to interfere
with the normal operations of
the University. The lots at State
and Dutch were built as close as
possible to those Quads as prac-
ticality allowed. Also, other col-
leges are so poorly planned that
lots are much further away; in
fact. students at Michigan or
Ohio State are not even allowed
to bring cars on campus. We are
extremely well off in terms of
where we can park our cars. As
for indian and Colonial, the
completed version of SUNYA,
not finished due to lack of
money. called for two lots, each
one a two story covered struc-
ture that would handle the cars
at lndian or Colonial as well as a
Grad Quad that would be built
on the other side of the lot. The
present lots are merely patch
jobs until the structures can be
built.

As for the often heard state-
ment that Albany State was
originally intended for a
southern climate, like Miami,

When this campus was first being planned over a decade ago, the
downtown campus was considered. But prob

Mr. Tisdale responded, “Well of
course we were all big boys,
those of us whoworkedon it, and
we knew damn well what the
temperature was here in Albany.
i lived here for many years...now
there's no validity to those
rumors at all. though there is
understandable reason to believe
this." He continued that
whether one was standing on
Campus, or somewhere else in
Albany. the winters ren't “fit

for man nor beast" o be walk-
ing the streets anyway. He said
that he realized that there was a
wind tunnel side effect of the

enclosed Quads with the towers
but that it was merely unfortun-
ate.

I‘hem is a more basic point as
to why the Uptown Campus was
built at all, instead of simply
extending the Downtown Cam-
pus. Mr. ’I‘isdale said in effect
that it all boiled down to mas—
sive bureaucratic red tape in-
volved in purchasing the many
small tracts of land required to
accomodate the extra 10,000
students anticipated in the ex-
tension. Before Uptown, there
were 3,000 full time students of
which 30 were graduates The

of 80%-20% undergrads to grad
students. with a gradual shift
toward graduate studv.

Mr. Tisdale concluded by as-
sessing the goals of the Univer-
sity in relation to its present
function. Is the Campus func-
tioning as a University should?
Answer, yes. is it functioning as
well as a University such as RPi?
Answer again, yes." But is it
functioning as well as it could
given the present state of the
physical campus? Answer ob-
viously no. But that is not to say
that the campus isn't always

undergoing improvements. that
within two years, we will be
functioning better than We were
the year before. Everybody here
is working towards that goal.
That'includes teaching, food ser-
vice, etc.

Walter Tisdale believes in the
University he helped create. We
will improve he says, but as we
are, we are already better than
others our size.

active in everything...[the other
relationship] is that we sit as a
check on the Council’s actions.
The Council usually has not
done anything so outlandish as
to warrant a decision except
maybe the strike, and we de—
cided it wasn't so outlan-
dish...that the Council never gets
into trouble means that maybe
it’s not doing enough in a lot of
areas. it should get into trouble
once in a while; experiment a
little more."

As for SA in general, Salem
feels that “we’ve been in a per-
iod of Executch dominance.
There's nothing the matter with
that, however, i think that the
government should be a little
better balanced The Council is
moving in that direction and the
Court is part ol‘ this, too. Wl‘

afraid of asserting ourselves to

that's no longer true."

Finally. Salem said, “Our pu r~
pose is contingent upon the pur-
pose of Student Association. I
don’t think Student Association
is responsible enough to students
and i think that students aron'l

tion...’l‘horo in a void between
the students and that great big
organization of BA. The Court's
purpose won‘t be fulflllod until
Student Association's purpose is

closer to the students."
