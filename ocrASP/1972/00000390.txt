news analysis

by Ruben Mayer

Somewhere I once heard some-
one say that the greatest in-
justice inherent in America's
democracy was that it reflected
its constituency. In view of yes-
terday's election returns the
above statement says a great
deal.

It says that the man who as
candidate for vice-president
spoke to a nation explaining
where he received campaign
funds, the man who in 1962 told
California and the rest of
America that we won't have
Dick Nixon to kick around any»
more, the man who dropped
more bombs in four years than
the U.S. dropped in both world
wars together, will remain in the
White House with the blessings
of a majority of the American
people. in fact, the largest
majority ever.

It tells us that America doesn't
give a damn anymore. It doesn't
care that 55,000 boys have been
killed for the defense of a ban-
ana republic. It is not concerned
about the suffering of poor
black, brown, yellow, red, aan
white people. To Nixon‘s
America there would be no stif-
fering if only they would work
and stop holding out their
hands. It tells us that millions of
Americans are content with the
Republicans‘ explanation of the
Watergate bugging, They are
content with inflation. they are
content with corruption and
worst of all they are content
with the status quo. Four more
years means four more yctirs of
the same government.

Something has happened to
this nation in the last decade.
The events of the past ten years
have gone by so swiftly that We
could hardly digest them. 'l‘i-liv
vision for the firsl few years
('nllullli“ il us to the horror irl
Vietnin ind for the last few
years liarilcni-d its toil, America
saw minority groups demand
what hail been denied to them
for two hundred years and at-
cUscd them of impatience It was
too fast We were on the moon
before the sixties ended. We
become ii computer society. Our
lives became rat rai'i-s as Wc
suffocated ourselves on the Long
Island Railroad. Everywhere
America looked she was being
threatened It was communism
abroad that scckcd to dominate
the world It was blacks at home

 

 

that wanted everything for no-
thing. The students were going to
riot and burn the universities.
The pushers were going to hook
our nation's youth. We needed
law and order; we needed some-
one who would hold back the
hands on the clock. Richard
Nixon was the one. In four years
not only did he hold the hands
still...he pushed them back a
century.

For those of us who look
unkindly towards Nixon and do
not view his past term in office
as encouraging let us as Mc-
Govern stated, "shed no tears."
We represent a united minority
of at least one third of this
nation. Remembering that it was
one third of this same nation
that 196 years ago led the
colonies into revolution. One
third of this country means
seventy million people and if
Richard Nixon believes that
seventy million people can be
ignored he is very much mis-
taken. If he belieVes that the
uniVersities will remain quiet
conclaves of indifference let him
try to blockade a harbor or
continue the war another year.
If he is under the impression
that he has free reign over this
country to do as he and his
associates will. he will learn fast
that he has not succeeded in
silencing those who oppose his
criminal antics. If Richard Nixon
believes that he can continu»
ously fool the American people
let him take heed of Lincoln's
words that you can not fool all
the people all the time. And,
finally. if he forgets that his first
duty is to schc the people, not
thc billion dollar corporations.
let him remember that the chic
ki-ns mill come home to roost.

As long as thcrc are men like
(ii-urge McGovern in our nation,
there is hope, Hope that some-
day Wc riiiglil flllfll illt' goals
established two hundred years
ago that still how not been
:it'lllt'Vt‘Ll. Hope that those who

Dixvillc, New Hampshire is a

A Staggering Nixon Victory

by John Fairhall

Shortly after 7:00 p.m. NBC
credits Nixon with Kentucky.
Tennessee, Indiana, Florida, and
Georgia join the Nixon column
soon after. At 7:30 ABC totals
show Nixon with a 35 point lead
over McGovern, 67—32. Nixon
has nine states and 115 electoral
votes.

Minutes later, Alabama, South
Carolina, Virginis, Mississippi,
and Florida are listed for Nixon.
A ’[‘V commentator reports that

Pierre Salinger, a top McGovern
aide, says that his candidate
must get New York, California
and Illinois to win.

(The old lady lending her
Western Avenue bar did not wait
for TV to predict the result. She
told her bar patrons the night
before that Nixon was the win-
ner. She told them he deserved
to win. Holding her bony hands
far apart for emphasis, she said

she had a long list of reasons
why she could not vote for
George McGovern.)

A NBC election analyst sug-
gests that part of Nixon's victory
is due to an expensive, personal,
voter contact campaign. The
blue collar vote in Indiana and
Ohio is scrutinized, revealing
great support for Nixon, much
more than he received in I968.
ABC and CBS predict Illinois for

Sitting on a stool, salt-and-
pepper hair pulled back and
rolled flat against her neck, she
said she did not trust McGovern.
She was asked about her faith in
Nixon after the Watergate ex-
posure. “Nixon can't always
know what the men under him
are doing, " she replied.

All networks declare staggering
victory percentages for Nixon, in
state after state. In the South
and Midwest Nixon is accumu-
lating 60—75 percent of the
popular vote. McGovern hopes
for a victory in West Virginia are
(lashed by ii network conclusion
that Nixon has won there.
McGovern gets the District of

as announcers recall Barry Gold-
water's, and even Alf Landon's,
miserable showings. The extent
of the defeat is evident in
Nixon‘s winning New York
State, a rare feat for a Repub-
lican candidatE.

As midnight approaches, the
networks wait for the customary
concession speeches. Shriver
appears and in South Dakota-
-another state he did not come
close to winning--McGovern
speaks. Smiling, responding to
the cheers of his still enthusiastic
supporters. he said:

“It hurt too much to laugh.
but I‘m too old too cry,”

quoting Adlai Stevenson.
He spoke of the long 22
month campaign, thanking

people and then addressed him-
self to the future:

“All of this effort will bear
fruit for years to come...I ask
you not to despair of the politi—
cal process in this country...So
let us play the role of the loyal
opposition."

Next, to the Republican head-
quarters whcre a fat, beaming
face congratulated the Republi-
can crowd, calling the vote “a
propcr tribute to the job Presi-
dent Nixon has done for the
United States."

'l‘licii Agnew:

”...in 1972 he won not on
faith, he won on performance."

'l‘lien Nixon, who appeared
twice, the second time in the
role of victor, accompanied by
“presidential music.”

“This will be a great victory
depending on what we do with
it." Nixon said more of course,
sticking mainly to light jokes,
and declaring hopes for the
American people in the next
four years.
