Tepetlino Wins Family Court

by Glenn von Nostitz
Mary Anne Krupsak, Demo-
crat-Liberal candidate for the
State Senate‘s 44th District won
a major victory over Republican
Conservative Robert Lynch in
heavy balloting yesterday.
Krupsak, who has often been
called a "fighter," based her
campaign on a platform of major
legislative reform and overhaul
of the state's pension and salary
structure. She is Roman Catholic
but took a strong pro-abortion
stand during the campaign, a
move which may have cost her
large numbers of votes and could
have meant her defeat. l-lcr
opponent focused on her strong
support of the McGOVCrn cam-
paign and attempted to identify
her with "radicals" through his
hard-hitting radio commercials.
Early returns from normally
heavily Republican areas showed
Krupsak ahead or close in most
(listriCts. Her main support, how»
ever, was centered in the City of
Schenectady. The final tally
stood 65,322 to 55,899.
Krupsak told this reporter last
night that her ovr-rwhelming Vlt'
tory may have been due in part
to the success of popular Demo
cratic Congressman Samuel
Stratton, who resoundineg won
re-election by a vote of l5t),l5l
to 43,854. His opponent, Paul
Ryan. was endorsed by both the
chi blican and ConservatiVe
,iarti as but was still considered
an "unknown." There had been
some speculation at the begin-
ning of the campaign that the
Republicans would cross-endorse
Stratton. Both candidates share
essentially the same vieWs on
foreign policy and defense, al-
though Stratton is considered
the more liberal on domestic

The three Republican can~

candidates in a very close con-
test. The trailing candidates iri-

issues. The campaign was
marked by an absence of debate
or contact between the oppo-
nents.

If Krupsak did, indeed, ride on
Stratton's coattails, there as at
least one local Democrat who
did not. Democrat~Liberal David
Roberts lost to well-known area
personality Clark Wemple by a
wide margin. Roberts, however,
was not particularly favored by
the Schenectady County Demo—
cratic Party, and he set up his
own campaign headquarters. He
had been closely involved in
reform politics.

in another Assembly race,
Fred Field beat Diane Dubiac in
the l01lrd district. Although he
is a Republican, Field down-
layed his connection with the
Rockefeller Administration,
which Dubiac expended a lot of
energy criticizing. Dubiac's con~
nections weren’t considered the
most savory, either, as she was
backed by the Albany County
Democratic Party, a relationship
she tried to dowuplay. She sur-
vchtl a rather strong attack
earlier in the year from liberal
SUNYA alumnus Steven Villano.
Field had the edge in this race
from the beginning, being the
incumbent for two terms.

Meanwhile, Assemblyman Neal
Kelli-her easily defeated his op»
poncnt in itcrtsellear and Albany
Counties. Kellclier won some
notoriety on the SUNYA cam-
pus a few years ago when he
attempted to block the appear»
ance of radical lawyer William
Kunstlcr here.

in the 104 th Assembly District
Democrat Tom Brown easily
beat another “'l‘om"~- 'l‘om
Conole. Thc ltlrlth is one of the
most heavily Democratic dis-

hy giving llt‘l' the lowest total ol'
the votes cast for the candidates
of the major parties. The other
trailing Democrats were
Supreme Court Justice Laurence
H. Cooke of Monticello and
Supreme (‘ourl Justice Bernard
S Meyer of (il‘fllll'lllll‘h'l. The
Liberal Party candidate,
Supreme Court Justice M. llcnry
Miii‘tusccllo of Brooklyn trailed

Stale Democratic (.‘liairniaii
Joseph (frangle, under the nor
mal course of cvans, could haVe
nominated two candidates to the
court this year and received on-
(lorscmcnhi from the chulr
limits. The Republicans then
would have nominated one can-
didate who would hch been
endorsed by the Democrats.
Crangle decided that the
Dammit; could win all three

tricis in the State, as Democrats
outnumber Republicans nearly 9
to 1. Brown’s victory was hardly
unexpected, although Conole
nearly defeated Democrat
Robert Keegan for the District
Attorney's post last year.

Conole thought that he could
win if Nixon broke the Demo-
cratic stronghold of Albany.
Nixon did succeed in winning
Albany, but apparently it did
not serve as enough of a boost
for Conole. The Nixon coattails
simply were too short.

in at least one other campaign
besides Field vs. Dubiac, the
Republican tried to disengage
himself from the Rockefeller
administration. Republican in-
cumbent Senator Walter Langley
ran against Democrat Len Weiss,
and stressed that he was not a
“rubber ‘tamp" throughout the
campaign. The difference be-
twr-en the two candidates was
mainly style,.as they both agreed
that there should be more legis‘
hitch power visva-vis the GoVer
nor. reform of the drug program,
and longer working years for
state legislators, Weiss’ style was
stronger and more outspoken
than Langlcy's, but he neverthe-
less lost, 82,493 to 62,997.

in other races, long time Al-
hany Police Court Judge Michael
’l‘cpedino won election as family
Court Judge over incumbent
Eileen Sullivan. Tepedino was
the Democrat, and so had the
backing of the Albany Demo-
cratic Organization. SulliVan, on
the other hand, had to rely on
hoped for Republican gains in
Albany County to win. She was
another candidate riding on
Nixon's coattails.

'l‘epcdino's tenure on police
court has been somewhat con-

State Democratic Committee
had not nominated a woman on

GOP Makes No Gain in

President Nixon’s large and im-
pressive nationwide victory fail-
ed to have much effect on Sen-
atorial races last night where the
balance of power remained with
the Democrats. The pattern that
emerged was one of close Senate
Conusts where both parties had
some seats in jeopardy.

Republicans failed to gain the
fiVe seats they needed to pro-
duce a 50 - 50 deadlock on the
Senate floor, and the results
failed to destroy liberal gains of
the last decade as some feared
they might.

In total, thirty three Senate
seats were up for grabs.

The returns from some key

Senate races:
MAINE....Four term Democratic
Congressman William Hathaway
scored an upset victory over
incumbent Margaret Chase
Smith in a race in which age
became the dominant facmr.

Hathaway led 92,000 to 86,000
with the returns still incomplete.

A dynamic Congressman and a
strong vote getter, Hathaway has
emerged in the House as a Pen-
tagoii budget cutter. He was a
member of the powerful House
Armed Services Committee.

Age was of special importance
in the contest because Mrs,
Smith, who has become incrcasa
iiigly hawkisli and conservative
and is not in good health, would
haVe become chairman of the
Seiiate Armed Services
Committee in the event of a
GOP Senate takeover, Hathaway
campaigned vigorously to win a
close race.

MON'l‘ANA....Dcmocrat Lee
Metcalf, a leading conservation-
ist and educational spokesman,
withstood a challenge by hard
line conservatch Republican
Henry Hibbard. a State Senator.
With over one-fifth of the vote
counted, Metcalf led 42,000 to
33,000 and was expected to win
with 56% of the final vote.
Mctcalf has been a consistent
critic of the Vietnam war, Volctl
against the ABM and has become

recognized as an articulate critic
of private power abuses, Hibbard
has supported preferential tax
treatment for banks, railroads,
oil utilities and mining interests
and voted against air and water
pollution controls, increasing the
minimum wage for the elderly
and consumer legislation.

Metcalf is G] and was first
elected to the Senate in 1960.
He served four terms in the
House where he was the princi‘
pal organizer of the liberal Dem-
ocratic Study Group.

SOUTH DAKOTA...D’2mocrat Jim
Abourezk defeated Republican
Robert Hirsch in a close race for
the seat of retiring Karl Mundt, a
reactionary Republican who has
not cast a vote in three years
because of illness.

Abourezk was expected to win
by a 54% - 46% margin.

He is a member of the House,
Judiciary Committee, active in
the fight for anti-war legislation,
education and ecology measures
and rural development programs.
He won a Congressional seat. two
years ago in a 52% upset victory.

Hirsch is an attorney and form-
er State Senator who is an estab‘
lished spokesman for large utili-
ties and mining interests.

The South Dakota race gave
the liberals the best opportunity

recent president of ldaho State
University.

With a quarter of the vote
counted, McClure led by 4,000
votes. He was expected to win
by a final margin of 54 - 46%

Davis won a hot Democralic
primary and had the actch sup'
port of liberal Senator Frank
Church, a wide and enthusiastic
student base and an energetic
campaign style.

McClure was one of the most
conservatiVe candidates who
sought office in this election
year, consistently opposing con-
servation and other major social
legislation. The race was a clear-
cut battle between conservative
and liberal forces in which the
conservatives emerged victor-

ious.

RHODE lSLAND....Dcmocratic
