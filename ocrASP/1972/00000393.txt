Billy Dean Smith Trial Goes to lury

Gov’t Eyewitness High on Smack at Time of Crime

In Fort 0rd, California, a mili~
tary jury of seven white officers
is expected to decide this week
the fate of a black soldier ac-
cused of murder in a Vietnam
“fragging” incident that killed
two youhg Army lieutenants.

Although there have been
numerous fragging incidents in
the war — 96 reported in I‘JISQ
and 209 in I970, resulting in
MN deaths ~ the fragging court-
martial of Pvt. Billy D. Smith is
the first to be conducted in the
United States.

It also has provided a focus on
issues that have baurited Amerrv
ca's involvamerrt in the Vietnam
war -- racism, antiwar feelings
among some troops, and the use
of drugs.

Trial Priitested

'I'hi! trial has been protested by
the Vietnam Veterans Against
the War and other groups.
“Under the Uniform Military
Code of Justwe, you're guilty
until proVen innocent and if
you're black, you're automatic-
ally guilty," Black Panther min
inter of cdueation Masai Hewitt
told one rally.

Smith, ii 24-year-old mustach-
ioed, soft-spoken black from the
Watts area of Los Angeles, is
charged with killing liit Lei.
'l'homas Dellwo of Chateau,
Mont, and Iiichard lIarlan of
Dallas, 'I‘ex.

Both died shortly after mid-
night March In, 1971, at the

Associated Press Writer

Bien Hoa Army base near
Saigon, when a fragmentation
grenade rolled into their quarters
and exploded, A third officer,
Peter B. lloggins, 25, of Harri-
son, N.J., was injured.

Army's Contention

The Army contends that
Smith, who was arrested within
two hours after the explosion,
rolled the grenade into the build-
ing hoping to kill his command
ing officer, (Iapt. ltandall L.
ltigby, and lst Sgt. Billie E,
Willis. Neither ltigby, who was
described by Smith as preju»
diced, nor Willis was present.

In additon to murder, Smith is
charged with attempted murder
and With resisling arrest.

It‘ollowmg the recent U 5.
Supreme (iourt ruling on capital
punishment, military judge (Jol.
Itawls ll. Frazier has ruled that
Smith cannot receive the death
penalty. But a guilty Verdict
could mean lifc imprisonrrii-rit.

(iiiilt Denied

Smith, testifying as the final
defense witness Wednesday,
denied any guilt on his part.
Instead, he told the. court he was
smoking marijuana with two
other blacks when he heard the
explosion in which the. officers
died.

"I got rid of my marijuana and
joined formation," Smith said
when asked about his reaction.

Another soldier, llenry Mc-
(Iliiy, 2‘3, of Chicago, corrobor-
ated the testimony. "I was
smoking dope with him," Mc
Clay said, “I was in the bunker
getting high when the explosion
went off."

The prosecution contended
that Smith was arrested after
Bradley W. Curtis, 20, saw some»
one resembling Smith running
from the explosion.

But under questioning by de-
fensi- attorney Luke McKissaclt,
(Tiirtrs said he “couldn't recog-
nize the person clearly," and
that he was “reading and smirk»
ing heroin . . . doing smack" at
the time.

‘Worliing Within the System’

Administration Turns Deaf Ear to Students

by Mike Lampert
Student Association President

Does the current University
administration believe in shared
authority on campus? Is force or
its imminent threat the only way
to achieve institutional change
on this campus? These and simi-
lar questions are troubling many
careful observers of SUNYA.

These questions seem to re-
volve around three central to-
pics. First, the topic of “univer-
sity community." Second, the
theme of “governance” (the de-
cision making machinery of the

denced a real belief in this con-
cept? As the ASP's editorial of
Friday, November 3, demon-
strates, it does not seem so. While
students have been systematical-
ly involved in the governance
system here, this in and ofitself
does not demonstrate a real be-
lief in community.
Governance

There are three ways in which
some people feel that our system
of "governance" is abused by
those who do not believe in
community. First, many deci-
sions and proposals, such as the

"Is force or its threat the only way
to achieve institutional change
on this campus?“

University). Third, the area of
“university affairs."

University Community

At the root of this topic is
what is sometimes called "af-
fected interest." The theme of
university community holds that
any person, regardless of that
person's ascribed social status in
this university, who has an af
fected interest in the outcome of
a decision has a right to be
represented in the decision mak
ing process. We’ve always believed
that this means that a person's
representatives have a right to be
invtichd, formally and informal-
ly. in discussions that will lead
to the decision that affects that
person. A critical element here is
that the involvement must take
place early on some decisions
eVen the evolution of tentatiVe
proposals tends to cause the
“tcntativr- proposer" to become
defensive, on some decisions it
causes the accidental closing out
of some valid options.

Have the past two years of
experience on this campus ew-

proposal for a three year bacca-
laureate program, come into the
governance system in such com-
plete form that the governance
system seems to do little except
rubber stamp them. Second,
major areas of concern, includ-
ing budgeting and priority set-
ting, seem to somehow never
enter the governance system, as
hard as it may try to corral

the community participate in
decision making? While partici-
pation is not always the same as
winning, a lesson which some
still have to learn, it is always
different from consultation.
Keeping our earlier discussions
of community and affected in-
terest in mind, it's easy to see
that participation supports com-
munity while consultation
denies it.

Failure to let all segments of
the community participate has
two main effects. First, several
careful observers have noticed
increased polarization between
administrators and students on
issues, and to a lesser extent
between faculty and administra-
tors. Eventually this will lead to
decision making along “party
lines," based not on the merits
of the issue, but on the source of
the proposal. Second, as some
segments of the community get
frustrated because this lack of
community decision making
does not meet their expecta-
tions, they will resort to more
forceful means of making their
point. Many of us believe that
rational discourse on the merits
is still a sound method of (loci

”...this institution is worse off
in terms of internal health
than it was...even one year ago.”

them. Third, after the communi-
ty government (usually the Uni-
Versity Senate) has acted, some
times its actions are ignored,
perverted, or subverted by those
who should carry them out, e.g.,
S-U grading, or seniority pre-
registration.

'I'herc is another important dif-
'erencc on the issue of govern-
ance: does the administration
simply “consult” with other
groups before deciding, or does

sion making, but as the ASI’
editorial aptly points out, is
rational discourse currently a
workable technique on this cam-
pus?
University Affairs

What's happened to university
affairs in a year? There are three
main thrusts of the area to look
at: progress on the “com-
munity” concept; the effort to
improve the university‘s rela-
tions with the outside com-

across a man With a set ol beliefs
that I think still run deeply
through a lot of American

them here.

The first was the very deep

to a monolithic and oppressiw-

was that “if they came and
asked for one car anil you let
them have it, pretty soon they'll
come back for the second car,"

The tlirril and perhaps the
deepest thing I saw, was a belief
that communism and the com
inunrsis basically governed wrth

munity ("university develop-
ment”): and a corresponding ef-
fort for the alumni (“alumni
development").

As for the ﬁrst, community,
even those who, despite the
earlier discussion, feel we are
still well off, would not deny
that we have less of a sense of
community today than we did
two years, or even one year ago.
Even if this is not directly the
fault of university affairs, that
concept has not achieved its
avowed goal of increasing the
sense of community on this cam-

us.

In these troubled budgetary
times, university affairs was to
increase the effectiveness with
which we told our story to the
outside community; it was to
increase our sources of outside
funding. There seems to be no
evidence that we are moving
toward this goal at anything
other than a snail’s pace. C-U
day, which was admittedly a
success from some perspectives,
is the exception, and not the
rule. It required such a massive
diversion of resources from
other activities that the sheer
effort involved seems to indicate
that We are not doing this job
well.

Lastly, the only area where the
university has made a concerted
effort to regularize communica
tions with outside constituencies
is with the alumni. While this
effort got off to a sound start,
the last seven weeks have been a
dismal failure from any perspec-
tive. We may, in fact, have done

Campus Movies Poorly Shown

To the Editor

Many students haVe spoken to
us of their regret that motion
pictures cannot be satisfactorily
shown on our campus. li‘eeling
that the movre stands beside the
phonograph record and the book
as a vehicle of insight and art, we
share their regret.

Educational Communication
experts on our campus feel that
movies are badly shown here for
several reasons. some projection-
ists, unaware that each Lecture
Center contains a screen, project
inovu-s onto a wall, which soaks
up and blurs the tones of the
picture Persons hired to deVi-lop
audio Visual programs for the
university are being nus-used as
prtijlrt'tiiin'lt'irlillli'itllln, and such
tecnhiciaiis are far too few here.
In addition, our projection
equipment is over-elaborate and
badly designed.

While we wait for matters to

andthen failing to follow up

evidence that this institution is
worse off in terms of its internal
health than it was two or even
one year ago.

This institution will survive. It
has survived major fires (Willet
Street), It has survived very bad
presidents . But there is a
difference between surviving and
prospering. The ASP editorial, as
well as some other acute people
here, seem to have good cause to
wonder if it will prosper.
