“Political Move”

Senior Steve Kipnis voted for
McGovern. He believes the re-
cent peace move was a “political
move," but is sorry a treaty
hasn‘t been signed yet. He voted
for the local Long island races,
not by party, but on basis of
who he had heard of and what
they stood for.

Don’t Trust Polls

Junior Peter l‘lusbach voted for
McGovern. lle lielith-s his candi-
date has a slight chance of win-

Will Restart War

“Nixon should go," said Chars
lie Bauer. He voted for Me-
Govern because “If i have to
leave the country due to the war
1 want to be able toconﬂ back."'
He believes the anti-war move
ment has gone downhill and is in
need of new lenders. He further
called Nixon's new plans for
peace "a lot of bullshit," and
thinks he would restart the war
after the election.

Domestic Issues

A McGovern voter, Steve
White said, “I really like his
ideas on Vietnam." Steve does
believe that the internal situa-
tion is the real important one.
When asked about the recent
mova to end the war, Steve
recollected about when, four
years ago, “in an English class
we talked about this and the
instructor we had said it would
be rcally terrible if Nixon waited
until just before the election in
’72 to pull the men out and that
seems to be what he's doing."

Coincidence

Nick Henny voted for Me-
Govern. He called the recent
move to end the war a “sheer-
coincidence." He lives in Al-
bany, but registered in Long
Island, so he didn’t vote in any
local elections.

Apathetic

Diana O’Connor is a registered
Republican who voted for
George McGovern. “l'm really
apathetic about both candi-
dates," she said. She is registered
Republican only due to the ur-
gings of her father, who is also
voting for McGovern.

Kim Smennak

Kim Smerznak, a sophomore
voted Nixon. “I hate Mc-
Govern," she said. One reason is
his “stupid welfare policy that
wants to give people who aren't
even working more than people
who are." She thinks Mc-
(lovern's speech about crawling
to l‘lanoi to get the POW's back
is “idiotic.” When asked about

“McGoVern offers America its

ductive and useful society,“ said
Bob Mayer. “and compared to
the corruption, dishonesty and
insanity that was demonstrated

Best Chance

Mark Pickering was found
working at a McGovern table in
the Campus Center, yet he is
only 17 and ineligablc to vote. If
he had the opportunity he
would cast his ballot for Mc-
Govern because he believes he
has the best chance against
Nixon. Mark is helping to pro-
vide people with the information
they need, especially concerning
absentee ballots and the candiv
(lates‘ stands.

McG Honest

for McGovern. “I don't trust any
politician. but he‘s a bit more
holiest than Nixon."
Gary also voted in the local races
in thc Yonkers area. He believes
Nixon will on"

he said.

Dave Fox

Great Hope

Dave “Dox” Fox put his check
on the McGovern-Shriver ticket.
His other votes were divided
between Democrats and Liber-
als. He thinks McGovern repre-
sents the people who are “put
down in society," and sees the
candidate as the “greatest hope
for change.“

“I can't vott,' answered Fran
Bernstein. She missed by 12
days. She did work for Mc-
Govern, however. She sees the
Albany student body as “very
apathetic, though the political
groups have made last minute
frantic efforts to drum up in-
terest."
