SASU: Rough Going for lnfuttt Organizatiuiii

Editoth Note:

The Student Association of the
State University of New York
(SASU) was created in an effort
to join together many of the
individual student associations
of the SUNY system so as to
better achieve common goals.
SASU has been in existence for
only I] few years, and so is
experiencing the growing pains
common to many infant organi-
zations.

Today we present the first part
in a series on SASU, hoping that
it will clear much of the air of
mystery surrounding this organi-
zation. As SASU grows and dc-
velops students can expect to be
hearing about. it more and more,
and we present this series so that
our readers will be able to fit
miliarize themselves with an
organization that may soon play
a central role in student govcrnr
itnL'e.

Part I is a general history of
SASU since its inception somt-
two years ago. Other parts will
follow on Friday and next Turns
day.

by Ted Libuii

During the summer of 1070
the State University of New
York was searching for a iii-w
chancellor. SUNY Central Atl-

In part, SASU emerged its an outgrowth of the students‘ mic (or

government leaders from the
various state campuses, pre-
sumably to provide a meaningful
student input into the selection
process. This proved 1.0 be it
sham in the eyes of most stu-
dents involved. They were
merely rubber stamps.

With this bitter lesson etched
in their minds student leaders
from the University of Buffalo,
the State Colleges at Osweuo and
Cortland, Stony Brook and
SUNYA mel to discuss the feasi‘
bilily of a slate-wide student
association and here the Student
Association of the State Univcr~
ﬁlly (SASU) was first conceive-(I.

governments throughout the
State University system."
Turbulent Childhood

But the optimism was soon
followed by despair as the infant
entered a rather turbulent child-
hood. Conl'lict over voting struc-
ture anti membership dues
clouded the first general meeting
which was held at the end of
October, 1970 and the resulting
compromises were considered
far from equitable.

Votes rinrl duos were appor-
lltlnt‘fl by type of campus. Each
Univvrsity ccntt-r received three
votes and was assessed $6,000 of
fifty (‘t'nls per student, which-

teen out of a possible sixty
schools. Membership was con-
stant at twelve. Money was short.
and interest at a low level.

At the December meeting at
Stony Brook Peter K. Zimmer-
man, SASU'B first Chairman re-
signed. The Executive Vice
Chairman Mark A. Borenstein of
the University of Buffalo suc-
cceded Zimmerman. He was
given permission by the dele-
gates to move the central office
to Buffalo. His charge was in
wretched shape.

The Executive Committee met.
in February, 1972 to redefine
SASU's priorities and objectives.
Four Were adopted: “(1) provid-
ing direct services 1.0 student
governments and student govern-
ment organizations, (2) provid-
ing direct service to students in
the State University, (3) provid»
ing services to prospective State
University students, and M)
monitoring the actions of policy
organizations that administer the
State University of New York
and Higher Education in New
York State in general, particular-
ly the Central Administration,
the State Education Department
(Board of Regents) and the New
York State Legislature."

This new bursl of energy
would be wasted unless struc-
lurtii improvements wore made.
Recruitment of new members
was til it standstill and disscnsinn
was rampant among member
schools. Evr-n the University of
Buffalo, long a strong partici-
pant in SASU, began to show
slress. The Buffalo Spur-[ruin on
January 26, 1972 stated, “This
campus contribuLt-tl $11,000 to
SASU this year. So far the solo
return on the expenditure has
been Li) provide travel money for
local SASU members to attend
monthly meetings at various
points in New York State.
Therefore, unless it drastic over-
haul occurs in SASU operations
in tho next two months, this

 

   

University should cease to be a
member.”
Conﬂicts from Within

Conﬂict between two and four
year schools continued to rack
the association. Community col-
lege delegates distrusted the
state four-year college members;
the four year colleges feared
domination by the University
Centers. The original duesand
voting structure had been a poor
compromise. Delegates ad-
dressed themselves to these
problems at the April member-
ship meeting at Cortland.

Community colleges are
governed by local boards of
trustees. It was clear that. SASU
could not serve their needs plus
those of the state campuses. The
Cortland meeting amended the
bylaws to exclude community
colleges from regular member-
ship. These schools retained the
status of “affiliate members"
and could partake in all SASU
activities, except voting.

The Second Annual Meeting in
June, 1972 at Stony Brook was
the scene for the next. improve-
ment. The dues and voting struc-
ture was overhauled. SchooLs
now receive on" vote per every
2500 full time students. Dues
are ﬁfty cents per full time
student with no maximum.

SASU leaders View “37273
with hope. The new structure
has closed the ranks and aided
recruitment. Service operations
are beginning to gel. On Septem-
ber 5, 1972 a legislative contact
office, direct by former Harpur
Student Association President.
Ray Glass, opened in Albany.

SASU has not. yet received
ofﬁcial recognition from the
Board of Trustees. A Committee
of ten, including SUNYA’s Stu—
dent Association President Lam-
pcrt will soon convene with the
Chancellor to discuss this issue.
