Foreign Students Shore Experiences, AS

by Robert B. ladeluca

One looks for differences, but
they are difﬁcult to ﬁnd. After
one has passed the surface veil of
language, the similarities are
much more obvious.

They are human beings, differ-
ent from the other human beings
composing most. the SUNYA
student body only in that their
places of birth are scattered
around the planet. There are
approximately 220 of them and
they make up the group of
foreign-born students now re-
ceiving their education on the
Albany campus.

They laugh, they are sad - they
work hard, they goof off - they
succeed, they fail - in short, they
have similar trails and goals to
most of us and, like us, art-
looking for additional education
as a method of meeting those
objectives --but on a campus far
from home.

Around 65 of them live on thi-
rlowntown Alumni Quad and 30
on the uptown campus, thr- l’t'
niziinrlcr sharing the same off-
campus pleasures and hardships
all Albany residents receive.

The downtown group, lllﬂl'llli‘l'
with around »l0 American born
students, form a NIIXI‘tI Hllllll'lll
body who share cultural lli'l'l
tagvs on a daily basis 'Ihi-i l|\'l'

Wt'eks had elapsed, the liuiiilri-rl
knew r-ach other wle 'I'lim
swapped aspirations 'l'lii-i
talked of the past and Illl' lll
ture. The similarities of llll'll‘
thoughts are remarkable.

“There are too many pl‘UlJll‘
interested in monetary lliings,"
says John Park. “I would like to
work with young doctors lll'lliﬂ'
iiig even more medical assistance
to those who are in rim-(l, (‘i-r
lain restrictions limit llll’ iiurii

ones don't want to trawl.“ John

joring in biology.

ple. With an (early life tutu-hing

They are serious, these friends
from foreign lands, but the im-
portance of their responsibilities
doesn't. separate them from hu-
mor and Iight-heartedness.

Graciela Perez, form Puerto
Rico, smiles easily. Technically,
she is not from a foreign land,
but her language and culture is
of a Spanish heritage and she
ﬁnds herself comfortable among
others with a Latin American
background Her smile will be an
asset as she helps promote tour-
ism in the island of her birth. “I

conjectures, “but I most certain-

The desire to transpose the
education they are recieving into
education for their compatriots
stands out. in all conversations.
“The mountains divide the rich
from the poor; the teachers
don't always want to go, every-
one wants the cities." Jon
Cominguez, doing graduate work
in educational psychology,
speaks of his Peruvian homeland.

“We need, not. necessarily pro-
fessionals, but. more technical
educators, more vocational
schools, more skilled people." A
former high school teacher in
Lima, he is preparing to Leach on
2i university level.

Frederico Weber sees a similar
situation in Mexico, where they
are “teaching unneeded sub-
jects." He sees no need for Lea-
ching the theories of nuclear
physics or chemistry when there
are no facilities. In a country
that has many part-time instrucv
tors, professional educators are
needed “Mexico lacks food," hl'
says, “it nr-i-ds nutritional tech-
nicians. Schools must revise their
philosophies." Frederico is ta-

tin-so children and their mothers.

The financial problem is one of
the big ones. "While they are
