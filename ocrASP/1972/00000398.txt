The soccer season ended this
past weekend with the big uni-
versity center tournament held
here at Albany. As I expected,
the hooters from Binghamton
ran away with both of their
games, and the championship.
Buffalo finished second, Stony
Brook third, Albany fourth. The
tournament MVP was Bingham-
ton's Bellotte who scored 3
goals, and notched 4 assists.

In the opening; game on Fri-
day. Buffalc~came from behind
to defeat the Danes by a score of
3-1, despite Albany’s over‘
whelming domination of play
and statistics. The game opened
with Buffalo on the move, the
Danes falling back, and several
super saves by Albany goalie
John Thayer. To stop the on-
slaught, Larry Herzog was
dropped bacl: to swecpcrhack,
and the whole game changed.
Now Albary completely con-
trolled play, bombarding the
Buffalo net with shots, but fail-
ing to score until Loon Sedefian
was tripped iii the penalty box.
The resulting penalty kick was
put in by Alvarez at 30759 in the
first half.

The Danes stayed on top as the
second half started. and con
tinued to dominate play, but
could not find the net. l"ina||y,
Buffalo got a break, and it was
the same old story. Buffalo
scored their first. goal thanks to
'2 big defensive errors by George
Keleshian and John 'l‘hayer.
'l‘liayer appeared to have made
another great play when Kele-
shian kicked the ball right out of
John's hands. The ball chntual~
ly reached the But‘falo right wing
who was momentarily in the
clear all the way down the side-
line. 'l‘haycr came out to get
him, failed, and a fluke goal was

scored which saw Greg Macmil-
lan chase the ball into the goal,
only to fall short of stopping it.
Thayer should not have come
out of the goal—the wing had no
shot, and would have been
picked up by Macmillan before
lie would have been able to turn
inside.

Minutes later, the refs took the
game into their own hands.
After a battle in front of the
Danes’ net, Thayer appeared to
have made a great flying save,
but was called for tripping, This
call was ridiculous as 'I‘hayer
definitely got the ball, and get-
ting the ball is the only pre-
requisiste for a sliding tackle.
This call was typical of the
rcffing we have suffered with all
year, and was unfortunately
characteristic of the tournament.
The resulting penalty kick went
in, and the game ended Il-l,

Statistically, the Danes outs-hot
Buffalo, 33-18, committed fewer
fools, and controlled play for
most of the game, but Buffalo
put ll in the net, to our one.
Also of note was the disgraceful
behavior of Buffalo's No l‘l
who should ltiIVc been ejected
from the game seVi-ral times. He
got into sew-rat scraps,
threatened an Albany player in
front of lhe refs, openly cursed
the refs to their faces, and was
guilty of overwhelming unsportw
manlike conduct. Wlicn (.‘oacli
Wingcrl complained, he was told
to shut up and sit down,

Island was totally outclassed by
the tougher, bctter skilled boot-
crs from Harpur. An early Bin-
ghamton penalty kick hit the
post, but did not matter, as
Binghamton still managed to
lead 1-0 at the half. Stony Brook
came out like a house on fire at
the start of the second half, but
Binghamton quickly put out the
ﬂames with another goal, this
time by Bellotte. A final goal by
Bingliamton merely served as the

The consolation game played
on Saturday morning saw the
Danes pull another near upset,
only to blow a halftime 2-] lead,
and later, a 2 goal edge. Once
again the Danes dominated play,
despite an early Stony Brook
goal.

With 19:48 elapsed in the first
half, at Stony Brook fullback

game, and that Stony Brook
would score at least one more
goal. When play resumed, the
Danes came out ready to kill,
and quickly scored at 4:55 via a
Walzer pass to Hauesing who put
it in. Now things really looked
good for the Danes—a nice, 2
goal lead, a disheartened oppo-
nent, and the realization that we
could win...and thcn~a lighten-
ing thrust at the Albany goal
resulted in a McGeady goal just
30 seconds later, to cut the score
to 3-2. Minutes later, Stony
Brook scored on a penalty kick.

That, and the removal of an
injured John 'l‘hayer from the
game in favor of sub. Steve
Carlsen, served to demoralize the
Danes. Steve starred in the goal,
making several fine plays, but
was unable to stop 2 Stony
Brook goals, The first was sim-
ply the beating of the defense,
and a resulting breakaway goal
from ti feet, The other goal was
scored via a line smash off the
post which rebounded off a
sprawled Carlsen, and into the
net. ’l‘licre' was no way Steve
could have stopped citlicr goal.
The game, and season, ended
with Stony Brook winning 5'3.

Binghamton outshot Buffalo

story.

Albany’s toumament performA
ance was far superior to her
season's play, but unfortunately,
our luck and the refs stayed the
same. The question voiced by
coaches, players, spectators, and
this reporth was, and is, “How
can you have a tournament with-
out good refs? To quote the
Buffalo sportswriter after he was
asked what he thought. of our
game, “It should have ended 1-”,
Albany." Questionable call fol-
lowed questionablc call, and
merely served to amuse the spec-
tators and visiting coaches,
'l'hese gentlemen who are sup-
posed to be certified referees
received $35 per giime, plus ex»
pcnses, and they do ahorrcn-
dous job. I realize that officiat-
ing is not an easy task, but I
wonder why better officials
could not he obtained for the
tournament.

Lastly, mention must be made
of three Albany players who
played outstanding ball through

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1972

 

 

by Kenneth Arduino

A good football team is a team
that takes advantage of the other
team’s mistakes and prevents the
other team from taking advan-
tage of their own mistakes. Un-
der this definition the Albany
State team has to be classified as
a good team, after defeating
Siena 36 to 21 Saturday.

Albany had a 14-3 halftime
lead and then took advantage of
three had miscues to add 22
points in the third quarter. The
fourth quarter saw Siena score
three touchdowns against the
Albany second team to make the
score respectable.

The game started in a light rain
which put a damper on this
rivalry. Albany ranked number 2
in the latest club football poll
came out with their normally
tough defense. Stopping Siena
on their first series, Albany took
the ball near midfield. After two
running pliiys, Bertuzzi made the
wishbone offense work perfect-
ly. He faked a hand-off to
McCoy Allister and rolled to the
right. The Siena defense went
for the fake and went after
Allister, Bertuzzi then pitched
out to Marvin Perry, who scam-
pered untouched 43 yards into
the end zone. Mark Fuller co-
vertcd and Albany led seven to
nothing,

Siena threatened once but
Bruce Cummings intercepted as
the Albany defense held Siena
without a first down until 3:10
left in the first quarter. The
Albany offense though, couldn't
do anything with the supposedly
Weak Siena defense.

The offense was able to lose 2”
yards on one series and gave up

 
 

    
 

   
 

 

    
   
   

     
    
 

     
  
 

    
    

  
 

  
  
 
   
    

got one first down but nothing
more as the Alliariy defense
dumped two running attempts
for losses. Siena tried to pass on
third down but it was short and
picked up by Bruce Cummings,
for his second interception.

The offense didn't want the
ball as they fumbled it on the
first play and it was recovered
by Siena on the eight The dc

as the high snap went right to

took off around left end and
bowled over for the two points.

Albany again didn't. move biil

broken tackles and a couple of

spins and Noel Walker had a nine

yard touchdown run to his
credit. Fuller got two chances at

the conversion, because of a

penalty, and made the second.

Siena could have used some
glue as they fumbled the kick
off which was pounced on by

Frank Leader, on the twenty-
seven. Four plays later, the un-
stoppable Marvin Perry went 17
yards for a touchdown. For
Perry, it was his last carry of the
afternoon. He finished with 120
yards on just 13 carries, 3 TD's
and the new Albany record for
most yards rushing in a sea-
son.

With a 36-3 lead in the fourth
quarter Coach Ford had a deci-
sion to make. Should he keep
the regulars in and impress the
polls or should he give some of
the men who see little action
some play? Ford went with his
bench.

Albany offense, now led by
Gordon Kupperstcin could do
nothing. His passing was way off
and the running attack poor.

The defense was also ineffec-
tive even though they did pick
off their twentieth pass of the
year. Receivers were open and
tackles were missed as Siena was
able to score three times. It was
loo late as Albany's first three
quarters made up for the fourth.

Albany got away with nine

fumbles (four lost), something
they can’t do against better
teams. The offense was not able
to sustain any drives and only
scored on big plays. The kicking
was Weak as Perka averaged only
Ill yards. Siena was also able to
get a couple of good returns
against the kicking team.
