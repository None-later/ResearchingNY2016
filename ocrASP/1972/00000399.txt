Below is the Departmental Recommendation, or “letter of
transmittal" written by Richard C. Teevan, Chairman of the
Psychology Department and sent to Melvin Bers, Associate Dean of
the Division of Social and Behaviorial Sciences on October 16th.

The recommendation came out of Teevan's discussions with
various faculty members in the Psychology Department as well as
the faculty meetings where it was recommended not to give

Waterman tenure by a 9 to 8 vote.

I will go down the list of evaluative criteria, commenting on each:
a. Mastery of subject matter: I have discussed this matter with
members of the department and based on their opinions and my
own, my rating of Dr. Waterman is about average for a person of her

age and experience.

b. Effectiveness in teaching: I have enclosed a summary of ratings
from students which Dr. Waterman has received. In my experience
with this form, these ratings are excellent. I would rate Dr.
Waterman as one of the best undergraduate teachers in the

department.

c. Ability as a scholar: Dr. Waterman has six published articles,
with one further article submitted to a journal. She has had her
doctorate for approximately five years so that this averages out to a
little more than one article a year. I believe this to be a below
average production for a tenured member of a good department at
the University level. I believe Dr. Waterman to be below average in
the area of ability as a scholar. I will mention this area again under

the category of continuing growth.

d. Effectiveness in University service: In terms of departmental
service I would rate Dr. Waterman as above average. She is the
chairperson of our Undergraduate Curriculum Committee, the
advisor to Cathexis (an undergraduate Psychology-Sociology Club),
and the advisor to Psi Chi. In terms of service at abch the
departmental level, I would rate her as below average. So far as I
know, she has served on no committees abovo the department level.

e. Continuing growth: This is a very difficult thing to assess. In my
own mind, I tend to look at the productivity of a person and try to
figure out whether or not he or she is visible in the profession or has
a good probability of becoming so with a reasonable period. This
does not take away from the subjectivity of the judgement, but it
helps me in coming to some kind of conclusion. Using this kind of
criterion, it is my judgment that Dr. Watcrmun will not become
visible is a reasonable time. In other words, it is my judgment that
Dr. Waterman's scholarship is not up to par fora tenure position at a
University Center and that this will probably not change. In terms of
teaching and departmental citizenship, she is already more than

satisfactory.

Using all of the above as criteria, and taking into account the votes
of the faculty of the Psychology Department, it is my recommen‘
datlon that Dr. Caroline Waterman not be granted a promotion to
associate professor or a continuing appointment at this University.

Waterman Responds to Teevan

Below is a response to ’l‘ccvan's
letter of transmittal which Dr.
Waterman wrote on October
31st. In this response shi- dis-
putes many of the findings of
Tecuan‘s recommendation, purl!-
cularly in regard to mastery of
subject matter.

a. Mastery of Subject: Dr.
'I‘ccvan's comments on this leave
the following questions un-
answered:

(I) With whom did ht! discuss
this issue?

(2) How were thcxc individuals
selected?

(3) 0n the basis of what evi-
dence did they arrive at tlwir

conclusions? (It should be noted

that none of my collcugucs has
ever attended one of my classes
and few of my senior colleagues
have had conversations with me
about subject matter.)

(4) What is the “average” for
my “age and experience"?

I'd appreciate it if the Faculty
Pcrwnnsd Committee and the
University Council on Promo-
tions and Continuing Appoint-
ments would attempt to got the
answers to these questions so
that they can make an informed
evaluation of Dr. 'l'covun‘s umur‘
tion. The fact that the answers
to these questions we". not
specified in the latter of trans-
mittal muhmt it Impossible for

me to respond to the evidence
on which the designation of
"average" was based.

The available evidence indiA
catcs that l have excellent
mastery of the subject matter.
Mastery of subject matter is one
of the the variables that uppcar
on the Psychology Department
teacher evaluation forms which
you have in my file. It's an insult
to the students to imply that I
can get those evaluations with
only "average" mastery. l“ur~
thermorc, if you Interview stu-
dcnta who huvc taken a givon
course of mine during different
semesters, you will find that l
have continued to revise my
reading lists and lectures in light
of new developments in the
field.

I understand that you hich
several [otters on filo from
pcoplt- who are highly know
ledgouhlv about my work which
substantiate my claim of (,‘Xttt‘l-
lcnt mustcrv.

I'd like to point out that while
mastery of UM! fiuld lit a nocua-
nary quality of an effectch
teacher, it In the ability to
genomic rnuslcry on the part of
the students that Is of para
mount Importance. I would
welcome tho opportunity to
have the review committees use

The "Waterman Papers"

some objective measure to com
pare the knowledge of my stu-
dents to that of students who
have taken the same courses
with other professors.

b_ non - in . u .
While I would not be expected
to take issue with Dr. Teevan’s
judgment that I am "one of the
best undergraduate teachers in
the department," I do wish to
take issue with it on two
grounds:

1. The data shows his com-
ment to be an understatement.
My teaching evaluations have
consistently been the highest in
the department even though I
often teach a required course,
Statistics. (You can validate this
by asking to see the evaluations
of my colleagues.) Furthermore,
last year I was one of the finali-
sts for the Outstanding Teacher
Award, scoring higher on the
criteria than the people who
were nominated by my depart-
ment. (I don’t know how I was
nominated, but it was not by the
Psychology Department).

2. His remark is open to the
interpretation that I am not
highly competent at graduate
level teaching. Unfortunately, I
have never taught a graduate
course despite my numerous re-
quests to do so.

c. Ability as a scholar Ur.
Teevan's figure of seven ar'icles
does not include my six conven-
tion papers which contribute to
what he refers to as “visibility”
or the three manuscripts in pre-
paration which will be submitted
by the end of January.

I seriously question the vali-
dity of this paper-counting ap-
proach to the assessment of
ability as a scholar, It is impor-
tant to note that nowhere in Dr.
Teevan's discussion of this cri-
terion is there mention of the
quality of my research. You

 

I am releasing these memos to
the press with the full under-
slunding (list some people who
serve on the appeal committees
may view this action as inap<
proprialc, I am doing this be-
cause I think it is time that the
students who are offcclt'd by
personnel decisions got a chance
to see how these decisions are
made. I hope that this sets a
precedent at this university for
full public disclosure. The peo-
ple who make decisions here
should not be permitted Io CIIII-
linuc operating in secrecy. They
should be held publicly nccount~
able for their actions.

have outside letters pertaining to
this, and you can see that my.
articles appear in highly f
spected journals with rig oils
refereeing standards and ' 0

,‘ " rates. One of my ar-
ticles was also reprinted in a
book which is used as a text.

While I am opposed to the
numbers game, I feel that if
number of publications is the
criterion that Dr. Teevan is
using, he at least ought to apply
it in a consistent manner. Last
year he recommended someone
for‘tenure who had approxi-
mately half the number of publi-
cations that l have. (I am not
attempting to imply that this
person should have been denied
tenure. On the contrary, I think
he is a strong asset to the depart-
ment.)

d. Effectiveness in university
service: Dr. chvan's statement
regarding this criterion is des-
criptivoly accurate. However, I'd
like to point out that l have
volunteered to work on com-
mittees above the department
level but have never been asked
to serve. I have served in an
advisory capacity to student
groups outside the Psychology
Department.

I am curious as to why my
availability to students including
during most lunch hours and
some evenings and weekends is
not viewed as a university ser-
vice. The purpose of this univer-
sity is to serve the needs of
students.

c. Continued growth: Please
note that not a single piece of
evidence is cited by Dr. 'l‘ccvan
to substantiate this admittedly
subjective judgment regarding
this criterion, The only objectch
basis on which we can attempt
to prcdict future growth is past
and present performance which I
have already discussed.

Waterman Responds Again

Waterman felt compelled to
write a response to ’l‘ccvoh's
supplementary letter of trans-
mitlul (which is reproduced be
low). The memo printed here
was written by Dr. Waterman on
November 5th, and disputes
many of the findings in ’I'ci-vun's
supplementary latter as well as
his original transmittal letter.
The basis on which the five
faculty members were selected
by Dr. 'I‘cevan is unclear. Since
they are not identified, it is
impossible to assess their com
potence to evaluate my research
The fact that someonc's in-

 

 

Um plow.
Slt‘nllltdlili- . -.. no .. . ..
that ’uholuily ‘jllirllll all] g... “any”...

ability to "imagine" me “engag-
ing in solid Interplay" can seri-
ously be offered as a reason for
denying me tenure is a strong
indictment of the whole tenure-
granting system. Furthermore, it.
substantiates my claim that I
have not been evaluated on the
basis of the ﬁve criteria.

No evidence is cited to support
the allegation that my research
"reflects little originality and a
rather trite use of theory." This
judgment was obviously not
shared by journal editors such as
Daniel Katz and Boyd McCand-
less who accepted my articles for
publication in journals with very
high reviewing standards. The
only study to which specific
reference was made is character-
ized by the second faculty mem—
ber as showing “limited imagina-
tion." This‘study was nominated
by some faculty members at
Buffalo for a Creative Talent
Award (an award sponsored by
American Institutes for Re
search. was reprinted in a book
of readings edited by Anthony
Doob and Dennis Regan, and
was described by Chester Insko
as representing "an interesting
contribution toward bridging thr-
gup between two apparently dis«
similar research areas" which
should “make a contribution
both to the field and to tho
journal" (see enclosed letter).
Furthermore, I don‘t sec how
anyone who has looked at my
vita can arrch at the conclusion
that l have only produced “two
pieces of work." (Dr. 'I‘ccvan
has acknowledged seven).

I notice that I've been dc-
moted from "one of the best
undergraduate teachers in the
department" to a “good undcr-
graduate teacher." The state-
ment that a "fiasco" would on-
sue if I were to teach “a solid
group of graduate students” is
devoid of empirical support
since I haven't taught a graduate
course. The assertion is one
more example of the way in
which some people have substi‘
tuted their personal prejndgn
ments for an objective assess-
ment of my past performance.
The available data on my teach—
ing is clearly inconsistent with
what the author of that state-
mom "would envision.“

I hope that the large amount
of attention being focused on
the criteria of research and con-
tinuing growth does not cause
people to lose sight of the im-
portance of quality under
graduate teaching.

New Inconsistencies n Warren Report
"The evidence clearly indicates that at least more than one
person was involved in the shooting."

by John Covert
Alternative Feature Service

You‘d think people would lis
ten to a man like Cyril Wecht.

He's a forensic pathologist--u
person with degrees in both law
and medicine. He's Research
Professor of Law and Director
Institute of Forensic Sciences, at
Duquesne University in Pitts-
bUrgh; and a Clinical Assistant
Professor of Pathology at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
School. He's also a recent past
president of both the American
Academy of Forensic Sciences
and of the Amcrican College of
Legal Medicine. Besides that,
he’s the Coroner of Allegheny
County (Pittsburgh).

But when the discussion turns
to the charges by Wecht of
discripancies in the Warren Com-
mission Report on the assassin-
ation of Presidcnt John Kcn‘
ncdy, persistent silence is the
official response.

This August, Wecht bccamc
the second non-governmental
medical export allowed to view
the items from the autopsy of
President Kennedy stored at the
National Archives in Washing
ton.

In a recent interview, Wecht
said he questioned the Warren
Commission's findings even be-
fore his two days of research at
the Archives. But when he came
out his conclusion was that “the
Warren Commission Report is
totally untenable, unacceptable
and absolutely incorrect as far as
its findings on Lee Harvey 05'
wuld and the single assassin
theorv."

The First Critic

The Kennedy family turned
over numerous items from the
autopsy to the Archives in Octo-
ber, 1966, with the stipulation
that none of the material be
released to the public during the
lifetime of Kennedy family
members, and that after five
years “recognized experts in
pathology or related sciences"
be allowed to view them.

The first “expert” granted per
mission to View the items was
Dr. John Lattimcr of New York.
Lattimer is a urologist-a kidney
and bladder specialist-whose
only qualification seems to have
been that he has been a consis
tent defender of the Commis~
sion's findings. Lattimcr spent
just three hours in the Archivss
last January and immediately
afterwards rclcascd his conclu
sion that the autopsy items sup-
ported the Warren Commission's
findings.

Wecht, then was the first critic
of the Warren Commission Rc-
port to be allowed entrance, and
this only after he spent nearly a
year attempting to get permis-
sion from Burke Marshall, a law
professor at Yale Law School
who acts as an official represen-
tatch for the Kennedy family.
chht says he probably
wouldn‘t have gotten permission
at all if Marshall hadn‘t been
prodded by others interested in
the autopsy items.

When Wecht finally did make
it to the Archives. on August 23
and 24, he said he discovered a
number of autopsy itt‘ms wort-
1nt-xplirably missingr most
notably the prcscrvcd brain of
the President and a number of

microscopic slides of tissues re-
moved from the bullet wounds.
So far, no one has explained the
disappearances. But what re-
mained at the Archives was
enough for Wecht to conﬁrm his
doubts.

In our interview, Wecht recre-
ated the scene at Dealey Plaza
and Parkland Hospital in Dallas
and at the Bethesda Naval Hos-
pital, where the autopsy was
performed the evening of the
assassination.

In Dealy Plaza, the President’s
car “had just made a right hand
turn and was proceeding to an
underpass when shots rang out.
President Kennedy clutched his
throat, Governor John Connally
was struck, thcn Kennedy was
struck in the head." By the time
the President was brought to
Parkland Hospital nearly 30
minutes later, be was already
dead with the basics of “life”
being preserved only by much‘
inc.

“Under Texas law the autopsy
would have been performed in
Dallas,"said Wecht. “But there
was much confusion, a lot of
shouting and ordering going on,
and eventually through ruse and
other tactics the body was taken
out a privatc door and put
aboard Air Force One for tho
flight to Washington.“

“Now, [he autopsy at Bethesda
Naval Hospital should not have
been any cause for confusion.
Unfortunately, instead of lhc
timc lapst‘ being used to gel the
most qualified pathologists for
the autopsy, thi- situation got
worse "

Inconsistencies Found

Wt't'lll said l.lll‘t'l' staff doctors

were given the task, only one of
whom had experience with for-
ensic pathology. “It was essen-
tially a military undertaking. Ad-
mirals, generals, FBI and Secret
Service personnel were present
in the room to oversee the
autopsy. The doctors acted as
military subordinates,"

According to records made at
Parkland Hospital, Wecht said,
doctors there noted two
wounds: one, a huge gaping
hole, on the right side of Ken»
nedy’s head, and the other a
round circular hole in the middle
front of his throat.

Doctors performing the
autopsy in Washington, however,
noted three wounds: the huge
gaping hole in his head, a smaller
hole in the upper back of his
head, and a hulc in his back six
inches below shoulder level. This
latter wound was puzzling be-
cause no exit wound was found
for it, yet the bullet was not in
the body.

“They concIUdcd,” said Wecht,
“that the bullet which had enter-
ed his back fell out of the same
hole onto a stretcher when doc-
tors at Parkland administered
pressure to the President's chest
to revive his heart," and, indeed,
a bullet had been found on a
stretcher by a janitor at Parkland
during the early evening of tho
twontyscctmd.

The wound in the throat. was
not even examined at Parkland
because doctors had, in their
haste, used the bullet hole to
insert a breathing device into the
President’s throat, Thus, the Be
thcsda physicians noted only
"an incision" in their report.
“No one thcrc had enough for-

ensic experience to realize the
incision was actually a bullet
wound," said Wecht.

And so. Wecht went on, the
doctors at Bethesda released the
body for burial and gave their
results: Kennedy had been hit
twice, once in the back (the
bullet of which fell out later
from the same hole), and once in
the head (the bullet of which
fragmented). Nothing was said
about the smaller wound on the
head; and, of course, nothing
was said about the throat
wound.

Wecht said the embarassing
part of the autopsy came the
next day-after the body was
already gone-when the doctors
learned for the first time that
there had also been a wound in
the throat. Rather than admit
their mistake and re-examine the
body, Wecht said the doctors
made a “despicable” choice and
“chose to be quiet about it."

The easiest way out was to
match up the wound six inches
below the shoulders in his back
and the wound in his throat.
“But you couldn't very well
have a bullet entering six inches
below the neck, then make a
sudden U-turn and exit out the
throat," said Wecht. “So they
simply altered the sketches that
had pinpointed the wounds I‘ve
seen the first sketches made of
the wounds and they showed a
wound six inches below the
shoulders. I've also seen the
holes in Kennedy's shirt and
jacket and everything matches
up. But in their testimony for
the Warren Commission the doc-
tors simply mchd the hole up
