Universi

by Henry Yegerman

As well as being the center of
instruction for ﬁfteen thousand
people, the university center is
also quite active in the area of
pure research. In present times
the funding of research in the
university comes from various
places. There is the money that
is alloted in the budget of the
university for work to he done
in the departments of the univer-
sity. There is money funded by
private foundations such as the
Ford Foundation, Carnegie and
the Kettering Foundations and
lastly. contributing the greatest
portion of the funds. are
branches of the federal govern-
ment under the auspices of the
National Science Foundation
and various offices of the depart-
ment of Health. Education and
Welfare.

The field of research grants is
extremely competitive and the
pressure to constantly \yin new
giants is great. Dr. Louis Salk-
ever who is Vice president of
Research (irants. states that re-

search giants at the university
center have gone up 20% in the
mist fiscal vear since the univer-

    

sity received eight million dollars
in funding and only made use of
sweat million. The extra money
was held over for research in the
present fiscal year.

The total amount of research
funds alloted to SUNYA is fif.
teen million dollars, compared
to the sum of eight million that
was given to the university in the
fiscal year 1968, a tremendous
increase by any standard

Obviously the university is
finding success in its competi—
lions. As Vice-President Salkevcr
“What determines
who shall receive a graiit is de-

explained:

pendent on many factors, the
reputation of the people. the
reputation of the school aiitl the
available facilities"

The administration is fully be-
hind expanded research .it the
university arid encourages the
facility to apply for giants as
well as handling the necessary
paperwork.

There ate seven giaiits to the
university Iroirr parts ol the De-
partment of Defense. for exam—
plc the largest giant ol approxt-
iitately 550,000 dollars is from
the office of Air Force Research

and deals with navigation
through clouds. Most of the Uni-
versity’s grants are in the sciencs,
overwhelmingly so. The total
amount of grants made in the
country last year in the huniani‘
ties was only 34 million dollars
and accordingly the percentage
of research done here for the
Social Sciences and the Arts is
minute.

The iiniversiiy will not do re-
seaicli on areas that will only
benefit individual concerns. ltlll
tiitliei stresses that the informa-
tion that is released is open to
all. That is why the Defense
Departments Lit‘tivnies in re-
search here are quite small as
opposed to some other schools
which do provtde secret research
Ioi sponsors pttlilic oi private.

It is the continually cvolvtng
iole of the university to change
with the times. In order to do
this it must he constantly striv-
ing for new iiiloiinatioii to betv
tet understand the times. and to
foster the development oI new
knowledge. disseminate ll wrthin
the community. and add to the
enrichment of education here at
Alharty State.

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER It). 1972

 

 

by Ted Liban

second in a series

When J. Smolick was fired as
Student Association of the State
University of New York Execu-
tive Director in June, 197]
SASU was left without a full
time contact in Albany. SASU
replaced him with a part-time
legislative assistant who moni-
tored activity in the Capitol and
worked with the association’s
lawyers in evaluatingbills. How-
ever, this was an imperfect sys-
tem.

To fill this void, the SASU
Capitol office opened this Sep
tember with Ray Glass as its full
time director. He had worked
for student rights for many
years. As Vice—President of Har-
pur's student association he
played an important role in the
establishment. of SASU. In
197l-72 he was Harpur's SA
President, He fully understands
the need for a full time staff in
Albany. “I found in the first two
years (of SASU) much of what
they did was passing resolutions.
We found there wasn‘t time.

Most of the Executive Commi-
ttee were Student Association
Presidents. It was difficult, if not
impossible to dedicate time to
SASU."

Glass will work with a program
that was first comprehensively
presented in March, 1972. At. a
conference to .be held this week-
end in Oswego these goals will
he sharpened and clarified by
the SASU membership. Glass
will attempt to get these goals
passed in the coming Legislative
session.

Much of the emphasis is on
financial aids. SASU will advo-
cate reforms in the Regents
Scholarship and Scholar Incen-
tive Programs, including increas-
ing eligibility at the under-
graduate leVel from four to five
years. Also stressed is the need
for an easing of the laws govern-
ing financial emancipation.
Eventually SASU leaders hope a
free tuition program will be
insituted throughout the State
University system.

Glass views the operating pro-

cedures of the Board of Trustees
as grosst unjust. The Governor
appoints members and they
meet in private session. As
SASU's representative he will
urge the enactment of laws guar.
anteeing the representation of all
members of society on the
Board. Also advocated is the
appointment of full voting mem-
bers of the Board representing
faculty, staff. students and alum—
iii. SASU will push for an open-
ing of Board of Trustee's oper—
ating procedures.

Glass, looking into the future,
sees SASU uniting with other
groups, such as the American
Civil Liberties Union and the
Sierra Club in the ﬁght for state
government reform. This in-
eludes permitting students to
vote at campuses, and amend-
ments to the constitution pro-
viding for referendum initiative and
recall procedures.

During the 1972 Legislative
session controversy erupted over
mandatory student activity fees.

passed the Senate and barely
missed in the Assembly. In a
newsletter to individual Iegisla-.
tors Chairman Mark Borenstein
of SASU stated SASU’s posi-
tions. “If a student body by
referendum authorizes its stu-
dent government to impose a
mandatory fee, then its expen-
diture should be determined by
the student government. Control
by the college administration un-
dermines the autonomy of stu-
dent government." One of the
most important duties of Glass
and his staff will be defending
students and their governments
against similar encroachments by
the Legislature.

A Recent Accomplishment

On April 26, 1972 a memoran-
dum signed by Vice-Chancellor
Spindler at SUNY Central auth»
orized campuses to institute
charges for sueh items as drop-
ping and adding classes. SASU's
members authorized Borenstein
to urge the reversal of this de-
cision at the Annual meeting
held last Spring. 'I‘hey unani-

U: Many New Goals Set 7

mously endorsed a statementde-
nouncing the new fees.

Borenstein fought vigorously
against the new fees. In fact the
Buffalo Spectrum stated: “Dr.
Boyer's acceptance of SASU's
alternative plan came after Mr.
Borenstein. chairman of SASU
had a private meeting with the
Chancellor in Albany."

This example leads into
another of Ray Glass’s duties. In
addition to legislative work he
will keep a close watch on
SUNY Central, the Board of
Trustees, the State Education
Department and other education
oriented offices.

SASU now has a full time
officer in the Capitol. He is
attuned to students needs and
knowtetteahle of their govern-
ments. Glass and his staff, which
includes Cortland’s former stu-
dent association Treasurer,
IFrank Llwellyn, should be cap-
able of adequately serving SASU'
