louisiona

NEW ORLEANS- The head of
Southern University in New
Orleans resigned Thursday,
bringing in a peaceful end to the
nine-day occupation of the
college’s administration building
by student militants.

Southern Vice President
Emmett Bashful said he was
quitting after 14 years as head of
SUNO in order to avoid a show'
down confrontation between
students and police "that might
result in loss of lives."

His action resulted from fever-
ish behing-the-scenes nego-
tiations. It was announced to the
students and hour and a half
after the deadline in Gov. Edwin
Edwards' ultimatum had passed.

The governor had set 1 pm. as
the deadline for students to
leave the building or be evicted
“by whatever means necessary."

Police had been placed on
alert, but no uniformed officers
:ver showed near the campus.

Bashful‘s resignation brought a
roar of applause and shouts of
"right on!" from the some 300
students who had gathered out
side the building.

Soon afterward, the some 150
students barricaded inside the
building marched out, holding
clenched fists aloft in the black
power salute.

Concessions won from Gov.
Edwards included academic
“amnesty"for students involvvd
in the uprising here and at llii-
9,000-student main campus in
Baton Rouge.

Student spokesmen insisted
that though the administration
budding had been fret-d, class

The main demand of the
students—the creation of new
executive councils under student
control—was not met.

Concessions won were, in add-
ition to amnesty, city bus service
along a boulevard leading to the
SUNO campus, authority for a
student audit of SUNO financial
books and some campus medical
services for the 2,750 students.

News Analysis
by Walter R. Mears
AP Political Writer

Sen. George McGovern's quest
for the White House was
doomed by the blunders of its
infancy, errors that all his cum-
paigning could never undo.

To the end they plagued his
candidacy. And in the end they
helped President Nixon attain
one of history's great landslides.

In part, the fatal ﬂaws
stemmed from what McGovern
had to do or thought he had to
do to catch up and win the
Democratic nomination in the
first place.

11 was particularly valuable to
ii president whose own campaign
organization had been impli-
cated in the June 17 wire-
tapping of Democratic national
headquarters, and whose top
White House aides had been ac-
cused of political sabotage and
espionage.

And it was particularly frus-
trating to McGovern, struggling
to take the attack, but always
forced to defend. Nothing net-
[led him more than the fact that
his own credibility, once rated
his greatest asset. was put in
question.

It was the imagc of radicalism
on one hand and indecision on
the ollicr that appeared the cen-
tral McGovern problem.

In that situation. McGovern
steadily cscaliitcd llic tone and

Again and again, he said it would
give nothing to anybody able to

But the old proposal, and the
impression it left, never stopped
haunting his campaign.

[000% For Eagleton

The Eaglcton case really began
with ii question, put, by the
Missouri senator’s account. by
Frank Mankiewicz, a top
McGovern aide: “Tom, do you
have any skeletons rattling
around in your closet?"

Eagleton said no, and hours
later. on July 13, he was duly
nominated to rtiii for vice presi-
dcril with McGovern.

'McGovern remained a candidate
in search of a theme that would

drive for the nomination,
McGovern had of necessity put
together his own organization in
the primaries, usually waning
head on into the opposition of
the party establishment.

That, too, left its scars,
notably in Chicago, whose
Mayor Richard J. Daley was
denied a seat in the convention
that nominated McGovern.
While Daley came around, some
in his organization never ap-
pcared to be wholeheartedly be-
hind McGovern.

There were the highly publi-
cized defections of Democrats
for Nixon. notably that of John

secretary of the Treasury.
