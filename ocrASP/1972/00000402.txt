Abouzerak, a liberal Democrat
from South Dakota, scored an
upset victory Tuesday in the
state's Senatorial race. Several
weeks ago, Abouzeralz delivered
this address on the ﬂoor of the
House of Representatives. Ex-
cerpts are reprinted from the
Congressional Board as a guest
editorial -ed.

by Hon. James Abourezk
Congressman from South Dakota

Mr. Abourezk, Mr. Speaker, it
is a dirty war.

It is u hateful war.

It is a war which has hurt us at
home more than we will ever
know.

It is murder.

It is lolly.

Are a hundred cities
rotten to the core

the best advertisement

of our way of life?

II is the second worst enter
pose of Wllli'll mankind has
been capable in the 20th ecu
tury.

II has shown ihi- iiiiinllmeiiial
sillpiilily of which mankind is
capable.

II has shown our incredible
capacity in swallow lhe sanit-
pack oI lies lllIlI' rrl’ler' lime.
knowrng in” Well all ihe Wlllll‘
thal they are lies,

And it goes on. and on, and
on.
The headlines We read lhis
month l'rom ihl- War l.l)ll(’ are a
nightmari- replay ol‘ lhc murder
and blood and Violence thal
have numbed our sense of
humanity for a (ll'l'ntll'.

Those are Iiuiiiaii Iii-mus, Mr

Speaker, on our side, on their
side. When a bullet rips the
ﬂesh, when a midnight explo-
sion scatter! the parts of the
body, and when the blood rum
on the ground, whether on our
side or theirs, it is a part of the
family of man that has been
destroyed.

Are we Cannibals? Do we pro-
pose to tame political passions
in Vietnam by killing or crip-
pling everyone there?

When does it stop, Mr.
Speaker? When?

In 1965 we were told, “Just a
little more time."

In 1966 we were told, “Just a
little more time."

In 1967 we were told, “Just a
little more time."

In l968 we were told, “Just a
little more time."

In 1969 we were told, “Just a
little more time."

In 1970 we were told, "Just a
little more time."

In l07l we were told,"Jusl a
little more time."

And now in I972 we are told,
“Just a little more time."

A little more time for what,
gentlemen? For murder, for
bllmllslici, l‘ur Violence, I'or tyr
army, all in the name ol' the
hrghi-sl ideals mankind can es
pouse.

Is lhal not sick" How can lIIal
l‘ail lo make your girls wrench"

Here we are, the gri-ales' and
mosi powr-rl'ul nation in II“-
world, conned lry a handful of
inililary dictators lo sacril’ii'i'
hundreds ol' thousands of lives,
In maim millions more, on a
political premise of worthless

Here we are, the greatest and
inosl powerful nation in the
world, made inlo lords and
laughinustocks because we lack
the guts to correct a mon-

strously obvious error.

We have sent hundreds of
tlionsands of people, including
50,000 at our own young, to
their maker, and the best We can
say of it that we leaned .not‘to
