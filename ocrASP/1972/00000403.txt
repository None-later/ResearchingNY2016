by Kevin Daniels

Jamming is fast becoming an
extinct art form that may well
be lost to the concert-going pub-
lic forever. True, there are still a
few artists around with a ﬂair
for the jam, but most of the
ones you’ll hear today are slop-
py,‘ unmoving grunt-and-groan
rip-offs of that late, unlamented
Edgar Winter conglomeration
called White Trash. Innovative,
logical lyrics get replaced by
Jerry LaCroix-styled imitations
ofa dog in heat.

last Saturday night It's a
Beautiful Day and Stonegrourid
at Siena college provided ample
evidence of this sickening trend.
In defense of Siena, both groups
were supposed to be openers for
Flash, and English are-rock band
led by ex-Yes-man Peter Banks.
Unfortunately, Flash ran into
paperwork hassles with their
visas and couldn‘t make the
date, so the school got stuck
with putlirig on the appetizers as
the main course.

And they weren't too appelil-
ing. Slrmegroimd has eleven
count'em members. That total
includes ex-Beau Brurrirnel srrigei
Sal Valentino. a mostly inaudi-
ble sax player, four female vocal-
ists Whose rrrairr purpose was to
try to imitate the fire of the
Leon Russell chorus. spotty and
irregular drumming. and fiVe
other musicians of even lesser

diltinctione.'~ Stoneground is
probably the only group Iknow

g of that could render Taj Mahal’s

Corinna as a Dylan/Winter High-
way 61 Revisited. In fact, almost
everything they did sounded a
good deal like Winter's run-
through of that Dylan number
(they did remember to change
lyrics for each song).

It's a Beautiful Day came on
trailing clouds of San Francisco
ego-hype and promptly pro-
ceeded to more or less slaughter
half a dozen of their recorded
tunes. The nadir of their descent
was reached when their old clas-
sic, “White Bird" was battered

into our ears with spike-studded
combat boots. And as bad as
that was, it didn’t hold a candle
to their “jam.” 7

Whatever hope was left of bet-
ter things to come plummeted
when all or some of the seven-
teen "performers" ln both bands
came out together for one solid
hour of rattling, tambourine-
pounding, and screaming oh-
yeahs! It would have made a
wonderful commercial for do-it-
yourself noise polluton. Their
finale of Dave Mason’s “Feelin’
Alright" was a can of deadly
botulism fed to a music-starved
audience.

Dawson/Travers

by Kevin Daniels

Another SUNYA extravaganza
down at. the gym had its bubble
burst Sunday nite by a very
sparse audience. Jim Dawson's
opening set was an edited, 55
minute version of the two and
one-half hour show he does as a
headliner (he did it at Union).
Those of you who didn't come
missed a very mellow perform-
ance of some fine music. Daw-
son’s back-up was a bit fuller
and richer, since his old bass
player is now covering electric
guitar, piano, and pedal steel
(the new bassist wasn't really all
that good, but he was newt.
Even though the background
racket in the gym l'rom thr- nuisr‘
of people moving around on the

wooden stands nearly drowned
out Dawson’s vocals, they did
come across (to those who could
hear them) very well. The high»
light of his show had to be his
performance of “Song Man.”
After a hurried intermission
Mary Travers came out to per-
form a seemingly fair enough
set. Her hand was particularly
inept, dragged down by a new
drummer who‘d just been added
the day of the performance, to
Mary's expressed delight and our
silent distress.
As a substitute for the encore
she didn’t really deserve anyway,
she returned to the stage for a
few bows and a kiss thrown out
to the paying customers beforc
the quick sprint for the pay-
check and the dark.

A Yippie Revolt

Young radicals, dejected by
their failure to whip up anti-

I’ve neVer understood why I

assertive. I developed my athle-

with my brothers and gain my
Dad's approval. It did work. But
then there were those times
when my family went out
“dressed-up" and I‘d have to put
on it dress. I was annoyed then,
and rccallrrig thosr‘ times now l

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

I‘d be playing softball some boys
passed by and made offensive
comments. I don't remember
them but they dealt with me
being a slugger and how they
wouldn’t want to meet me in a
dark alley. The comments hurt
me then and I still remember
them. One summer an en—
lightened male friend of mine
asked me if I wanted to play
second base in a softball game. I
told him no because I wanted no
comments made against mc and
I wouldn't feel comfortable. “9
said that l was good, badly
needed on the team, and better
than most ol' the othcr guys. llc
said that thcrc's no reason not to
do something I do Well anrl
I'IIIH) And he's right!

Now I am remembering what it
is likc for me to walk in any
city's downtown area. I feel like
a piece of shit. I feel base,
worthless, and like a nonentity.
The male scum that inhabits
tlicsc pIaCcs are mean and are
disrespectful. ’I'heir whistles,
winks, witticisms suck. I feel
unsafe amongst them. To them I
am an object for their mascul-
inity. Well, for all this behavior
is worth, these men can go down
to a storc and show off their
masculinity lo the toy dolls.

Tonight I was carrying a very
light packag i aiirl my companion
knew this. He still attempted to
grab ll out rri‘ my hands. I
rcfuscd to let go. l‘ll‘ said he was
trying to bc liclpful and I said
I'm not liclplcss. My point being

it would haVe been easier for me
to let him carry the package, just
as easy as letting someone else
do your thinking. I like to do
what I can, when I need help I'll
ask unhesitatingly.

Last week a familiar incident
reoccured to me. I met a new
man on campus and we bit if off
O.K. Knowing he’s been bum-
ming around for awhile and me
being hungry I asked him if he
would like to go with me to my
apartment for a few hours for
some home atmosphere and
cooking. Some time passed and
hc so deftly snuck in a peck on
my lips. ’I'hcn while sitting at a
table hc snuck in a kiss on the
head. I knew he wasn't moved
because he liked me. I asked him
why he did that. After a lengthy
discussion we concluded that
he'd been taught to show his
affection in this manner toward
girls. But then it included the
“how will she react to this move,
if she accepts my kiss will she
fuck me later." All this was part
of his not too innocent kisses.
He did not sec me as a person to
bc thought of as an equal. And I
am not making too much of
this! With male acquaintances he
said hr» has nothing to gain, But
from a female acquaintance
thcrc's the ever conscious
thought of will she or won’t she?
Hell if the vibrations were strong
I wouldn’t have minded some
action, but it offends me that
this fella saw me as a means to
his end. I don‘t like being used.

TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS MISS HEROIN

So now little man you‘ve grown tired of grass

You think you could never become a disgrace
Arid crid up addicted to poppy sccd waste;
So you'll start inhaling mc one afternoon,
You'll be taking mc into your arms very soon.

And oiii-c l have entered deep down in your veins

You'll “ch lots of money as you have been told
l"or darling, I'm riittcli morr- cxpctislvc than gold

You'll swindle your mother, and Just for a buck
You'll turn into somr-tliing vrlr- aiirl corrupt

You'll mug and you'll stczrl for my narcotic charm
And I'i-r-l contr-ritmciit Wltr'tl l'rii in your arm
