The Love Drug: the Nation's New Kick

by Buddy Nevins

Alternative Features Service

“There were nude bodies
everywhere, squirming to get off
of a large throw rug and into
their clothes.”

The setting of a new porno-
graphic movie? No—the police
report of a raid on a methaqua-
lone party, America's aphrodi-
siac drug kick that: is spreading

fast.

Called “The Love Drug” by
users because of its reported
loosening of inhibitions, police
first started noticing large scale
methaqualone abuse about six
months ago.

“We began finding those little
white tablets,” said one narco-
tics agent, ” along with the
regular assortment of pot ant]
pills. lt sent us running for otir
copy of the l’hysiciun's Desk
Reference (a book containing
data and pictures of all prescrip-
tion medicines) to find out what
everybody was using.“

Made under the trade name
Parest, SOPOR, and Quaaludc,
methaqualone is a non-barbit-
urate sedative given to patients
who have trouble sleeping.

Movies:

Illegal users of the drug claim
it causes drunkenness, slurring of
words and loss of muscle con-
trol. But perhaps the best-liked
effect and deﬁnitely the reason
most give for its growing popu-
larity is its enhancement of the
sex drive.

Orgies among users are not
uncommon and the racy drug is
in great demand with “swinger”
groups of young, married coup
les. One Atlanta doctor pre-
scribed methaqualone for co—ed
patients, visiting them after of-
fice hours when he knew their
libido would be at its height.
And many arrested recently for
sex crimes have been found to
be under the influence of the
drug.

“it makes you float right into
an affair," said a dental assistant
who uses no other drugs except
marijuana “l have to watch who
I take it With as it makes you
more susceptible "

lt is mctliatpialont-‘s use as a
love polioii that has officials
worried “This drug is not a
harmless placebo to be used at
every campus mixer," said Dr
DaVid t' Smith, a Florida phys
iciaii specialt/Jng in the treat»

ment of drug problems. “It is a
powerful central nervous system
depressant that can cause inter-
nal bleeding and other horrors in
overdose quantities. The fact
that it has reported aphrodisiac
qualities makes it all the more
attractive to drug abusers, hence
more dangerous."

Even such an unlikely crusader
as Jerry Rubin has taken up the
banner against methaqualone.
During the recent demonstra-
tions at Miami Beach’s political
conventions, Rubin and his Yip-
pies organized on “Anti-Downers
and Anti-Quaalude March" to
protest against the increased use
of these dangerous drugs.

“l don't care what the effects
art, they are death," said Rubin,
clad in a red bathing suit for an
outdoor press conferenCe an-
nouncing the street action. And
with Miami Beach Mayor Chuek
llall looking over his shoulder in
approval, Rubin complained that
“the government is shoving these
Quaaludcs down our throats to
keep our minds sedated. "

Despite llubin's explanation,
