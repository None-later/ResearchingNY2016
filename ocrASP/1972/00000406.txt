Open letter to Dr. Benezet

 

Benezet’s Skeptic Condor Welcome

Dear Dr. Benezet:

I would like to thank you for
your refreshing honesty during
the broadcast of "Intercourse"
on WSUA Wednesday night I
have read the criticisms cited in
Dr. Teevan’s letter of transmittal

to Dr. Waterman with great
skepticism. It seems to me that
many of these criticisms are dan-
gerously ambiguous. I am re-
lieved to find that the President
of this University reflects some
of my skepticism.

’Effective Teaching’
Minor Consideration

To the Editor:

The ASP has been giving much
attention to the problem of I‘t“
hiring and tenure in the univer-
sity. The cases of Dr. Waterman
(Psychology), and Mr. (inscoync
(Classics) were reviewed iii an
informative manner for the gen
eral student body. It is ticccssary
that those students iiol iii the
Psychology and (.‘lassics depart
ments fccl personally involved in
these cases, ltl addition to
Psychology and (Tlassics stii
dents. These cases are illustrator
of the lack of concern tI\I‘l

of the quality of instruction

I would urge the entire student

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 10, I972

In particular, I refer to your
comment on the part of Dr.
Teevan's letter where a member
of the Psychology faculty, in
describing Dr. Waterman, stated:
“She is far too defensive to ever
allow herself to be exposed to
the kind of interplay which will
lead to greater growth." Your
response was: “ . . . It doesn't
have meaning to me and, with all
respect to Dr. Teevan, I ﬁnd it
too subtle a statement to under-
stand." Your honesty in this
response is encouraging to m".
Such candor from an administrar
tor is welcomed. llopcfully,your
frankness is an indication of
what my fellow students and I
can expect in future coniniunica

tioiis With you

Sincerely yours.

Prestige Over
Education

To the luditor
I'm a senior, about to graduati-
from here with 21 HA. in psycho
logy If someone asked me who
to take for a course in psych,
who really wanted to get somc
thing from it, I'd say Dr.
(‘aroline Waterman, l have taken
her for Ilircc courses, to keep
my enthusiasm for my major
going, and l have a really good
background ill the field as a
result. She is the most Inspiring
teacher and one of the most
genuinely concerned with teach
ing undergraduates. In a typical
Waterman class you'll get to
know the people around you
and interest in class discussions
ller lccl ures dcniiinsl rate a “high
|evel"of mastery over the subject
matter and a true love for the
field. She is able to draw the
class together in a totally new
pcrsonalizt'd academic i'xpcr
iciici- ()utsidi- ol llic classroom
she is always approachable and
will spend a great deal of her
time helping students lli-r View
on education ill unique and
displays her sincerity Shc finds
that a teacher iriusl meet up to
the student's standards or resign,
and the students must givv as
iiiticli back in the classroom, or
not take the course In each of
the three courses I've taken I'Vc
had to work my off, all the

academic challenges

To the Editor:

It is obvious that. the students,
and sometimes, even faculty
members, have no say in which
teachers are ﬁred and who
receivu tenure. 1110 ability of
the‘ 'powers that be' to override
student decisions is so obvious
that the lack of student protest
on this campus is sickening.

The approved methods for
trying to keep a teacher at
SUNYA—such as petitioning and
writing letters to Dean
Hunsberger et al., obviously have
no effect. It is time for us
students to unite over a real
issue.

It is not necessary to mention
the truly lousy teachers at this
school who have gotten tenure,
even recently, in the ‘budget
squeeze.’ But it is worth men-
tioning a few names of well-
-lchd and Very dedicated, or at
least very controversial, teachers
who have been denyed tenure
over our shouts of protest: Mary
ltaddanl, Louis l“. lsmay.
(Iaroliiic Waterman. ltichard
(iascoyne, (icrry Wagner (rcm»
ember him?) the list is too long.

Writing to Dean llunsberger
Wlll relieve somc of your anx-
ieties, but will not get any rt
stilts except a basic form letter
saying something like ‘llow nice
of you to write. Wt' realize that

I am not saying that perhaps

tenure; I am saying that. the
student. voice iii totally dis-
organized and too weak on this
campus. University policy has
blatantly ignored us on ques-
tions like lack of art department
funds especially as compared to
the ‘hard’ science departments;
questions about health service
policy; questions of tenure; I‘m
sure you have as many com-
plaints as I do.

With the easy excnses of
‘budget squeeze' or ‘lack of qual-
iﬁcations,‘ Dean Hunsberger is
going to lop off the heads of
many more teachers (his year let
alone the next and the next until
this school consists of nothing
but a handful] of ‘internationally
known' teachers, thousands of
'hard' science majors, and thou-
sands of pillars.

It is time we took definite
action. No one with authority is
going to listen to us unless we
grab them by their throats. I am
seriously proposing a tuition and
board payment strike for the
spring semester |973, to be ob-
served by every student who has
ever felt any teacher in this
school has been unjustly fired or
has had to fight too hard to
prove him/herself worthy of
tenure against inestimable odds.
Any student who feels that the
university overlooked as on any
policy decision should join in
this strike Mohawk tower, park-
ing situations, mandatory dinner
plans in the dorms, the huge
bookliiics, the fact that we have
liiizils until December 2:, etc.,
etc., etc., etc.

Think of your gripes We must
unite, Universities are for stu-
dents and teacherswwe should
all be partaking in an education.
The hierarchy of decision
makers exists because of our
huge size, not because of their
inherent rigth to rule. They are
in ofﬁce to serve us. We must
make sure they fulfill their pro-
per function

Administration
Shows Contempt

To [111' Ic'dttm'

The administration through
the Vehicle of security seems to
be displaying its complete con-
tempt for the studans‘. The ad
ministration is Violating an agree
ttlt‘ltl reached with student
leaders. l was at the meeting
where an agrccmclll. was
reached. 'l‘ownig cars that are
completely on the gravel behind
the Humanities and Education
buildings is a direct and con
tcinptuous Violation of the

agreement. Read the letter' dis-
tributed by John Hartley. Vice»
President for Management and
Planning.

The administration is showing
complete lack of concern
towards agreements reached
with students. Well, administra-
tion, we read you loud and clear
we realize we don't count with
you, We realize our lives mean
nothing to you. You have de
clared war on the student.

Student Health
Offers Flu Vaccine

To the .s‘t/N Y/t ('oiiiniiuiily

'l‘he Communicable Disease
(Ienter suggests that flu shots be
i-dininistered to individuals of all

debilitating diseases including
caidio vascular, pulmonary,
renal or metabolic disorders. In
particular patients with rheu-
iiiiitic heart disease or other
heart problems, patients with
chronic respiratory problems
such as asthma or chronic bron-
chitis, patients with diabetes or
other such endocrine or meta}
bolic diseases. A new Vaccine
which is relatively painless and

produces no reaction is partially

which is causing flu this year
called the England strain.

The Student Health Service
will be offering flu Vaccine to
students in the abch categories
immediately for the cost of the
material, $1 .l0.

Please note that flu shots are
not recommended for normal
healthy students nor for llllel'
