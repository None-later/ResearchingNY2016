SUNYA Bureaucracy

To the Editor:

I had a very frustrating exper-
ience recently when I attempttd
to acquire funds to run a spec
tator bus to the Albany football
game Saturday, November II at
Plattsburgh. This year, despite a
pitiful turnout on the part of
Albany students, the team has so
far gone undefeated and the
game at Plattsburgh Is the
season's last. I personally know
of several students anxious to
see the game but cannot afford

to charter a bus independently. I

turned to Student Association
for help and asked if there was
any channel through which
money could be allotcd. For all
the response I got it sci-med my
suggestion was totally absurd.
Unless I represented an organ-
izr-tl group with a written consti-
tutirin and submitter] a formal
request to br- ri-vicwvd bi-forc
Central Council... No“ l called
WSUA and the person there oi)-
viously considered it very
amusing, “What game" I'm Just
a lowly, humble 1).}, who
knows nothing."

I believed him.

So I tried the Office of Stu-
dent Affairs and there received a
polite but nevertheless negative
reply. The Ofﬁce of Student
Activities was at least sympa-
thetic, but said it was too late
this year and to possibly Contact
the Athletic Department for
ncxtscason.

It just seems to me that there
is something lacking here in the
line of responsiveness to ideas
coming from unorganized
students if all are met with the
same interest as mine was. And
I‘m sorry that our football team
will not witness a turnout of
fans at the Plath'burgh game, but
then again, what else is new?

SUNYA's Kosher Kitchen 0 Positive Force

Cashiers
are Scapegoais

To the Editor:

Being a cashier for nearly six
years, in at least ten different
places, I have realized how cash-
lens are one of the most opp
ressed groups of unskilled
workers. In a grocery store, for
instance, cashiers are paid less
money than all other unskilled
workers such as stock boys and
ofﬁce help. A guy can apply for
work as a stock clerk and start
off with $2.00 to $2.50 an hour.
A girl who is unskilled has little
choice. She would nchr be hired
for stock work or she has to be a
cashier and make only $l.85 to
$2.00 an hour. ’Ihis isn't rmdly fair.
Cashiers are extremely impor-
tant to a store's reputation
l)t'(.'11\15(‘ they have direct contact
with the customers. The
impression the customer gets at
the checkout counter is his last
impression as he leaves the store,
A good cashier knowrs this and
does her best to be friendly and
courteous, although this is often
difficult.

No matter what goes wrong,
most customers bring their com-
plaints to the cashier. Cashiers
irri- llll‘ script-goats they got all
the grief. Just the other (lay, a
customer of mini‘ discovered
that somr- of thc plums she

purchased were rotten. Who did
she yell at? ME. What could I do
about it? I could tell her that she
would be given a refund and she
may quiet down, but I have to
hear her remark, ‘and I thought
this was supposed to be a GOOD
store!’

Customers are what keeps a
store going, and it is the cashiers
that have the most contact with
them. All the cashier training
manuals will say this and empha-
site how important it is for a
cashier to be careful with the
thousands of dollars that pass
through her hands every day. If
a cashier makes a mistake when
she gives out change and her
register is short, she gets yelled
at and is told that she has cost the
store money. If it happens too
often, she is fired. If a stock boy
makes an error in stocking the
shelves, he just has to do it over
again. Nothing is lost. He is
allowed to make mistakes. A cash-
ier's job is much more tedious
and errors arc serious. Why then,
are cashiers paid less than any-
one t-Ise'.‘ And why do they have
so little status.l
