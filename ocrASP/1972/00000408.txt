The Albany Great Danes will
attempt to nail down an un-
beaten season in its third and
final year of club football with a
season-ending game tomorrow at
Plattsburgh. The task will be
difficult, since the Cardinals
have won five straight after two
losses and have beaten Albany in
each of the past two seasons.

Coach Roger Casciani has a
strong defensive club that has
outscored seven opponents,
103-57. After losing to St. Law-
rence (16-0) and Nichols (14-6).
Plattsburgh has beaten Brock-
port (15-0), KIT (19-14), New
England (22-7), Plymouth
(21-6), and Bridgewater (20-0).
Against two common oppo-
nents, Albany tied Brockport.
13-13, and beat RIT, 28-7.
Plattsburgh shut out Albany,
28-0, in their first meeting two
years ago and won a 76 die
fensive battle last fall,

The Cardinals have three run
ning backs with more than 250
yards. The leader is Jim McMul-
Ien, who gained 111 of his 377
yards against Rl'l‘. He also is the
leading scorer with four touch-
downs. Ray Philbrook has
rushed for 304 yards and Joe
Guadalupe for 258, including
three 'I'l)'s Quarterback 'l‘im
White has scored 22 points on
three 'I‘D‘s and a pair of two-

poiiit convr-rslons.

Dane's Football

Freshman halfback Marvin Per-
ry has set a season rushing re-
cord for Albany with 653 yards
to date. His 191 yards against
Brockport is one-game high and
he leads the club with five
touchdowns, three of which
came against Siena. Albany built
up a 36-3 third-quarter lead
against Siena, then withstood
three final-period Indian scores
for a 36-21 victory. The tie with
Brockport is the only blemish on
Albany's 6-0—1 record.

Joining Perry in the all-fresh-
man backfield will be quarter-
back John Bertuzzi who has run
the triple-option, Wishbone-T
with finesse all year; McCoy
Allister 326 yards; and Noel
Walker, I84 yards and three
TD's, who earned a starting
berth two weeks ago.

Albany has rolled up 1,670
yards on the ground, while out-
scoring seven opponents,
176-55. The Dane defense, led
by tackles Frank Villanova and
Dom Pagano, has blanked three
foes. The secondary has stolen
20 passes, four by halfback
Bruce Cummings, who inter-
cepted three against Siena.

Albany's main problem; par-
tially a result of the offense,
which necessitates considerable
pitchouts atid fakes; has been
holding onto the ball. The (ireat
Danes have fumbled vlli times
and lost 26 of them.

Bowl, Bowl, Did Someone Sciy Bowl?

by Bill Heller

No, this isn’t an ad for AMF‘ or
Brunswick. It is merely the latest
gem heaped upon the heralded
and undefeated Albany State
grid team. As they go up against
Plattsburgh tomorrow, in the
hack of their minds will he the
possibility of a bowl hid. If the
Danes win, and thus Complete
their record at 70-], they‘ll be
in direct line for a bid from the
National Club Football Associ-
ation (NCFA). It wouldn‘t he
the Rose Bowl, but nonetheless
it would pit Albany against one
of the top club football teams in
the nation.

After a hush-hush meeting
with head coach Bob Ford and
athletic director, Joe (iarcia, I
gathered these facts, l‘lvery year
the NCI’A sponsors a club howl
game ' this year there will he
two: one on Friday night, No
vr-mber 24th at li‘ordham lliilver
sity, the other the l'ollowmg
afternoon at Mount Vernon Sta»
dium in Westchester. Four bids
will be handed out sometime
between now and gametime.

The bids are usually based on a
national weekly club poll that
had Albany ranked third after
the HVCC game. Since then,
Albany hasn‘t been ranked. This
is where the problems start. lh-
causes Albany plans to go to
varsity status next seasou,|Jn-V
declined to pay the one hundred
dollars annual cluh fee. So they
were dropped from the rankings

Despite this, the Nt,‘l"A has
dropped feelers iii Coach Ford's
direction. On October E‘llh
l’ord got :I call from Illl' I'Iesi
dent of the N(II"A saying that
Albany was being considered, It
they paid their (Ines. I‘lllltl had
to hedge, mainly her-arise he
doesn't how the authority to
make the decision. A call again

Why was Ford consulted and
not athletic director liaii'Ia’
’I'hiit's what has bothered (lair-in
up to now. “I knew nolliingol .i

If he was to be consulted by the
