V Boyer Slates SUNY Move

from the state for $10 million

ALBANY (AP) - A railroad
building of Flemish-Gothic ar-
chitecture will be the new head-
quarters of the State University
of New York administration,
which is buying the well-known
upstate structure for $1.7 mil-
lion.

Most SUNY offices now are
concentrated in leased space in
the modern Twin Towers build-
ing just northwest of the Capitol
grounds.

The building, and Albany land-
mark, stands on the spot where
Henrick Hudson was believed
to have landed in his exploration
of the river that bears his name.

The structure was built in the
early part of this century as a
copy of the famous Cloth Guild
Hall in Ypres, Belgium. It is
constructed of reinforced con-

thing plausible. “Nobody chal-
lenged them. They said they
hadn’t drawn the first sketches
to scale but now they could
remember where the wound was.
Every other hole scar, incision
and mark was drawn in exactly.
Only (his hole was several inches
off."

Weeht said that in December,
1966, he was allowed to View
the Zapruder film of the assass-
ination, which he did over 100
times in addition to examining
blow-ups of each frame. He said
that using this film, the FBI was
able to gauge the length of time

crete and steel with Gothic ex-
terior detailing. The four-story

building, at the foot of the State
Capitol, has a 13story central
tower capped by a gilded weath-
ervane depicting Hudson’s ship,
the “Half Moon."

In announcing the plan Friday,
Chancellor Ernest L. Boyer of
the State University said the
Delaware 8: Hudson Railroad,
the present occupants, have
agreed to sell the building for
$1.7 million.

The interior will be rehabilita-
ted, he said. Asked about the
present condition of the interior,
the chancellor said: “I wish
there was a good synonym for
‘mess.’ "

He noted that the university
long has had an appropriation

that could be used for the reha-
bilitation.

The university board of trus-
tees was thinking about building
a new headquarters before they
looked into the possibility of
purchasing the D & H building,
he said. As for the cost of
acquisition and rehabilitation, he
said, “We’re not talking about
much less money than building
and not much more either."

However, the university admin-
istration expects to move into
the D & H building in about two
years where a wait of four or
five years would have been re
quired for a new structure.

A small park in front of the
building will be expanded and a
dissecting street will be aban-
doned, a spokesman said.

 

ogisl Criticizes

the President was struck, which
turned out to be about six sec-
onds. They also test-fired Lee
HarVey Oswald‘s rifle (a single-
shot, bolt-action Munlicher Cur.
cane) and found that the quick
est it could be loaded and fired-
never mind aimed-was 2.3 sec-
onds. 'I‘his presented a bit of a
problem in that four bullets
apparently were fired, and [hi-
length of time between them
purportedly was six seconds. Yet
it would take nearly seven sec-
onds just to get off that many
shots,

The results Indicated it was
“an impossibility that one per
son could havu done all the
shooting," chht said it was this
contradiction that led to the

 

Commission's “single” or "mag-
ic" hullet theoryuwhich affir-
med that one bullet “entered
John Kennedy’s back and exited
through his neck, went into Gov-
ernor Connolly's right back
(breaking a rib), exited from his
right chest into his right wrist
where it shattered a large bone,
then went into his right thigh,
only to be found later on the
stretcher at Parkland Hospital.“

“Whatever needed to he done
to correct their inconsistencies
was done," Wecht charged, “be-
cause no one else know what was
going on and it was not until
years later that private investi-
gators had a chance to see the
evidence,"

"we never want to have a situa-
tion" in which force would have
to be used by students. He then
went on the point out how
SUNY Albany has a greater
amount of student participation
in campus governance than other
universities.

Another student questioned
President Benezet on the plans
to build a west podium exten-
sion, and wanted to know if the
project were dead. According to
Benezet, the project is indeed,
dead. “At least in our life time
a ‘ will not see the podium
extended,” he commented.

He did point out that there is a
serious space problem on the
Academic Podium, and that “we
will be pressing our case for
more facilities." He sees students
as potentially "effective sales
men" for the University. Com-
ments Benezet: “A lot of out-
side people cannot imagine that
this massive podium is actually
crowded." He sees the students
as an effective tooi in convincing
the community otherwise.

However, Italian majors and
minors will be requested to read
the materials in their original
texts. Moreover, Part A of Ital-
ian Civilization (Ita. 316) will be
a prerequisite for the majors and
minors who wish to enroll.
There is no prerequisite for all
other students.

"Elementary Italian" will be
offered on Monday and Wed-
nesday evenings from 6:00 to
8:00 p.m. It is listed as It. 101A,

arren Report

was found on the stretcher at
Parkland Hosjnal. chht says
his examinati .n of the Archive
x-rays shows particles of metal
in Kennedy's chest and also in
(.‘onnally‘s chest-traces of the
bullet that passed through them.
This same bullet, according to
the Warren Commission, was al-
so supposed to have broken one
of Connally's ribs and shattered
a bone in his wrist. The bullet is
a 6,5 mm, shell with an original
weight of 161 grams. Two more
inconsistencies presented them-
selves, smd Wecht, because the
bullet found at Parkland has a
weight of 159 grams:

(1) According to the Com-
mission’s report, the bullet lost
only lwo grams of weight in
passing through both Kennedy
and Connolly and leaving traces
behind in both;

(2) and after doing all this
damage to both men, the bullet
has “no deformities in its upper
two~thirds at all and the bottom
one-third shows only very min-
imul flattening with no loss of
substance, "

In addition, one small section
of the base of the bullet was
rcmovod by the FBI for examin-
ation, which brings up the ques-
tion of how the bullet could
have lost any substance in pass-
ing through the two men and
still weigh l5!) grams uflcr the
FBI sample was remoVed.

According to Wecht, 45 minutes
after the assassination 'I‘ippet,
“who was in a place he had no
business being" (since all‘policc
had been ordered to Dealey
Plaza), spotted Oswald walking
down a street, “decided that he
was the assassin," and went
after-only to he himself killed.

“J.D. ’I‘ippet was there to do a
job that because of his failure,
Jack Ruby had to complete two
days later," Wecht said.

“By legal definition we‘re deal-
ing with a conspiracy,” he said.
And who is behind it all? Wecht
points to members of the CIA.
He said it is a well-known fact in
Washington that Oswald had
been on the payroll of the CIA
up to the time of the assassins
tion. “The CIA has pulled
bloody, cut-throat operations all
around the world," he said, “yet
no one wants to believe that it
could happen here."

Wecht's conclusions, as limited
as they are, parallel former New
Orleans District Attorney Jim
Garrison‘s conclusions. Garrison
(with whom Wecht has con-
ferred on the assassination inves-
tigation) claims that a group of
right-wing CIA members along
with members of the Cuban ex-
ile community and others plot-
ted and carried out the sin-
atiun, believing that P ..ident

grow unconfined by telephone

horizon is uncluttered with neon

aren't InVited to eat at Joe's or

mountain hills seem limitless and

so do you.

This is the answer, you think.
It’s uncorrupted, they haven’t
found it yet; it's clean, it's pure,
il's everything the city isn't, so
you decide to stay here and live
on/off the land. The old Spanish
villages lic hidden like unmiiwd
diamonds, waiting for you to
discover and refine them. You've
heard stories about local rcac-
lion to strangers, but you'rc
different, and New Mexico‘s al
lure is irresistible.

Natives of northern New
Mexico make little contact with
the outside. Some villages still
speak 17th century Spanish, and
many people think the Black
Panthers are wild animals you
see in picture books. But you
don‘l know this, and you don‘t
know that the people hHVc al-

connection with America, and
you don‘t know that young Chi-

their teachers and talk about it
like it's as popular as eating
dinner. You don’t know that
these people have spent lifetimes
trying to acquire middle class

you discard it. A life of simplici-
