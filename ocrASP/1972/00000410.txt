Views from - the Other Side

The Saga of the Cafeteria Supervisor

by Barbara Fischkin

The woman in the Quad cafe-
teria whom you would most like
to avoid while running out with
three deli sandwiches for your
friends and two sets of silver-
ware to replace the dirty ones in
your suite is not really a wicked
ogre. waiting to pounce on her
victimes. Instead, she is just a
nice, normal person trying to do
njob.

And, even though it may seem
that she is there only to under-
mine your finest attempts at
sneakiness, her job is actually
that of a dining room supervisor.
She is responsible for the
smooth management of the en-
tire dining room during meal-
times.

State Quad supervisor Burnetta
“Bea” Wilson, when asked about
her job, blurted out “Don't get
me started." She was very quick
to explain, however. that she
feels students on the whole are
Ver" nice and that she likes work»
ing arotind them. “it's just that
some are spoiled brats and may-
be they had no discipline at
home," she added. As an exam-
ple of a purely destructive act,
she cued taking off the tops of
salt and pcpper shakers and put‘
ting foil on them. Bea, who has
worked for food service for four
years believes the students do
these things becausc, “either
they have nothing else to do, or
do it as a joke," She doesn't
think that this is their way of
complaining about the food lic-
cause, “Even the ones who say
the food is good still do it.”
Even though by this time shc is
aware of the typical dining room
tricks of coming in tlic side door
and handing food through the
back bars, Bcu was very shocked
to find girls jumping th'l’ thi-
conveyor belts. "Fellows, you
can understand, but to sec the
girls do it!" Bea did mention,
hchVcr, that she is extremely

fond of hcr co-workcrs and bi»
lic\'i-.~. thi-y arc all vcry honest.
Motherly Figures
Mrs. (iladys Cutlcr on Alumni
Quad, and Hclcn M. Wclch, on

Indian, are the two supervisors
who beat exemplify motherly
ﬁgures. Gladys, whose warm and
charming British ways are famil-
iar to anyone who lives or has
ever lived downtown, has been
working for Food Service for
ten’ years, and plans to go home
to England at the end of the
school year to retire. She seems
to feel very close to the students
living in Waterbury and Alden
Halls. Even while being inter-
viewed she stopped to ask one
young man how things were
going. When he told her he was
just about making it she quickly
scolded him and said, “Oh you
better be doing more than just
that." It is obvious that the
students feel much the same way
about Gladys: she even spoke
about a “lowly, littlc letter"
that an anonymous student left
on her desk in which he said,
"...it was just nice when we
came down in the morning to
get a cheery hello and the
motherly touch made the day."

Since Gladys has been working
for Food Service for ten years
she has seen many changes in the
student body and spokc about
them. “During the first ycars
there was a role call and every-
one had to check in and out.
You had just so many late nights
per week and if you went away
for a weekend you had to leavo
the name of the people you were
staying with." Shc added that.
“Kids were more afraid to do
anything out of the ordinary,"
and felt that maybe now thcrc
is, “a little bit too much per-
missivencss.” Even so, Gladys,
nevertheless, mentioned that, “l
try to bc as understanding as I
can with their attitudes, 'l'hrec
generations ago we wcri- so dif-
l'crcnt." What more could you
ask from your own mother'.’ With
that attitude shc will ccrtainly
be missed.

Helen Wclch scents to supervisi-
lndian Quad with much the
same spirit as Gladys has on
Alumni Slic is very proud of the
fact that some of the studean
comi- to her with special prob-

lems. She is obviously very true
to their confidences because
when asked to describe some of
the problems she answered, “I
can't tell you because they‘re
personal." Helen, who has been
working for Food Service for six
years, (“l can‘t say I hate it 'cos
I don‘t"), claims that her biggest
problem is people trying to
sneak in on weekends. Neverthe-
less, she did admit, with a glim-
mer in her eye that at times she
feels a little guilty rcprimanding
students, but soon added, “they
know they're not supposed to do
this.” Helen’s favorite story in-
volving infractions of the rules
concerns one suspicious looking
young man who claimed to
definitely have a meal card.
However, upon checking it, she
discovered that it was indccd a
meal card, but from Syracusc
University. “That was rcal cutc.
Of course he didn't cat. But it
was real cute." Hclcn ended by
saying that sometimes sltc gcts
the feeling thc kids don't likc
her, btit she doesn't think it goes
very deep. And from the scnti-
ments on lndian Quad, it docsn't
seem to.
Good Money

For Valerie Hurlbcrt. living a
dining room supervisor on Dutch
Quad was 2i frightening proposi-
tion since she is the only student
cmployed in the position. Val,
who is a Junior and a History
major, Worked in the dining
room last year. She was madc
supervisor this year whi-n thi-
woman who was originally sup~
posed to have the job did not
return. Val admitted, “At first i
was kind of leery. i know that
last year's supervisor had a lot of
hassles." But then, the fact that
she would be working morc
hours and getting more money
convinced licr to take thi- job.
When askcd about her fricnils‘
reactions to licr new position of
authority Val replied, “Well, I
made most of my friends whilc
working here last year. They
decided it was kind of funny."

Along with the distinction of

by Ann E. Bunker

The week’s voting for “Cam-
pus Chest" came to a rousing
finale Friday afternoon with
lndiiin's RA Mendy Mendelsohn
winning out over Ron Sim-
mons. It was close race and
right up to the gong it was
anybody's game. The final tally
was 1727 for Mendy, 1076 for
Ron and $450 for Year-Round
Headstart, the recipient of pro-
ceeds from this year’s Campus
Chest drive.

The nickel-a-vote elections
generated as much or more en-
thusiasm on campus as the re-
cent national elections. People
rushed in and out, stopping long
enough to clteck the up-to-date
tallies then racing out to drum
up more support for the candi-
datcs of their choice. Some of
the brothers of STE-Mendy sup~
porters-"were on hand to liven
things up, as were folks of all
persuasions.

Parking Hassles Subject of Discourse ‘
Council Discusses Parking With Hartley; Camp Board Gets 0K

News Analysis
by Ellyn Sternberger

A very wonderful and un-
expected thing happened last
Thursday night. The Student
Association came together. In a
long, infomal meeting, that SA
President Mike Lampert de-
scribed as part of the Central
Council's annual growing pains,
the Council members discussed
the concept and role of student
government at Albany.

At first, the Council '5 outlook
was very pessimistic. One mem-
ber felt that SA was up against a
brick wall (regarding the parking
rules situation in particular and
the UniVersity decision-making
procuss in general). Another
member suggested the Council
disband because hc, himself, was
ready to ri-sign.

As thc feeling of futility
summed to mount, hampert be»
gan to spcak. Exccpl for the
questions that intcrruptcd his
lalk, lil‘ spokc for about an hour.
'l'hc (Touncil's full attention

turned to the President and a
feeling of unity could be felt
among the people present. So
far, the trend this year seemed
to be a greater exertion by Gen
tral Council of its full power to
the point that some felt the
Council would oppose Lampert
simply to oppose him. With this
great cleft growing between the
branches (despite Lampert's ef-
forts to stop it) it was a welcome
relief to see the two branches of
SA in harmony. It seems that
the present “crisis” of student
participation (or leak of it) in
University matters has not only
brought the students into oppo-
sition with the Administration,
but has finally united the Stu-
dent Association.

This is not to say that every
Central Council member was
100% behind the final decision
the Council madc that evening,
But. for the first time this year,
this reporter could fch the tinity

During the regular business ses-
sion of the meeting, the Central
Council gave the Camp Board
permission to purchase a parcel
of land adjacent to the Dippikill
property. The purchase of the
approximately 80 acres was jus-
tified by a projection of its
future use. the esthetic value of
the view from the lake, and the
ecological effect to the water-
shed if it was bought by some-
one else and developed. The
Central Council also approved a
supplemental appropriation for

should not be helped by student
funds when the Administration
is “totally unresponsiVe to stu-
dent opinion and doesn’t even
stand by agreements that they
do make with the students."

The bill was tabled and a sub-
stitute bill was proposed. The
new bill called for the abolish-
ment of the $10 towing fee and
a refund of all towing fees al-
ready collected this year. It also
directed the SA President to get
legal counsel to see if the towing
fee as established, implemented,
and enacted without an appeals
procedure is legal. It was the
feeling of the Council as they
passed this bill that the fee
violatcs (luc process.

.lolin Hartley, Vice-President
for Management Si Planning. was
at thc Central (founcil meeting
to answer iiiicslions about thi-
towing that was done last week
(from behind lhc Humanities
building]. Hartley was not on
campus for part of last week, so
it si-cms that the decision about
towmg was made by Director of
Security, James William. Hart-

      

ley refused to answer many of
the questions until he could
speak to Williams who was at
home, ill with the ﬂu. The only
point that could be established
was that cars were towed from
near the podium because people
with medical permits could not
park in reserved spots. Hartley
saw nothing wrong with this; the
Council claimed breach of agree-
ment and student discrimina-
tion. The question session
yielded basically nothing.

During the report of the Com—
mittee to Coordinate the En-
forcement of the New Parking
Regulations, the Council re
turned to the discussion of the
present Student-Administration
strife. It was now that Lampert
changed despair and futility to
constructive, hopeful thinking.
The final resolution was to try
to establish a meeting between
the Council aitd the top Univer-
sity Administration. it was de-
cidcd that the fate of the park-
ing strike would be determined
after thin meeting.
