Welfare People is Bod People

AUSTIN, TEXAS (CPS)--A
University of Texas sociologist
has found that the majority of
Americans are reluctant to sup
port welfare programs because
they believe that poor people are
themselves responsible for
poverty.

In an article in the November
issue of Psychology Today, en—
titled “Poverty: We Still Believe
that God Helps Those Who Help
Themselves," Dr. Joe R. I-‘eagin
reports results of a nationwide
survey he began in 1969, which
examined beliefs about the
causes of poverty in America.

0f the 1,017 people sampled
in the study, more than half
located responsibility for pover-
ty in the characters of poor
people themselves. Such factors
as lack of thrift and proper
money management, laziness,
and loose morals and drunken-
ness, Were cited.

Fewer of the people querr
tioned blamed poverty on social
and external issues, such as low

 

wages, poor schools and pre-
judice, or on factors such as
illness or “bad luck."

People who hold a person re—
sponsible for his or her own
poverty also tend to have nega-
tive views on welfare programs,
and oppose anti-poverty propo-
sals.

Feagin says that he found that
in almost every case," a plurality
took an anti-welfare position."

Feagin also discovered that the
higher the income, the more
likely it was that one would take
an unfavorable view of welfare.

Respondents with a high
school or a college education
were found to be more anti-
welfare than those with a sixth-
grade education or less.

“This ﬁnding." says Feagin,
“deals something of a blow to
the idea that education elevates
onc‘s critical capacities, since it
is clear that a large number of
educated Americans accept
many myths and misconceptions
about welfare."

WELLS & COVERLY'S NEW SHOP
AT STUYVESANI PLAZA

A high percentage of those
surveyed gaVe afﬁrmative re-
sponses to such statements as:
many people getting welfare are
not honat about their need;
there are too many people re»
ceiving welfare money who
should be working; many
women getting welfare money
are having illegitimate children
to increase the money they get.

Contrary to the beliefs concer-
ning illegitimate childrenI Feagin
points out that most children
born out of wedlock do not
receive welfare. According to a
1969 Aid To Families with De-
pendent Children survey, three
out of 10 children on welfare are
illegimate. A recent study in
Utah found that 90 percent of
the illegimate children on wel-
fare had becn born before their
families went on relief.

Feagin states that the survey
data conﬁrm that “Americans
are dragging their feet on the
road toward welfare-slatism, and
that their reluctance is closely
related to strong beliefs about
the meaning of economic fail-
ure."

He concludes that "as long as
large numbers of Americans at~
tribute social problems to the
character defects of individuals,
massive economic reform will be
extraordinarily difficult. Indi-
vidual interpretations of poverty
mesh well with conservative at-
tempts to maintain the status

The Youth Vote

by Terry Ryan
Associated Press Writer

What happened to the youth
vote?

It was there and it did have an
impact.

Younger and more liberal can-
didates won state legislative
races and local contests in many
parts of the country with a
strong boost from ﬁrst-time
voters.

A University of Nebraska stu'
dent unsealed the chairman of
the state legislature's executive
board. A 26—year-old Vietnam
veteran will replace the oldest
member of Hawaii's house of
representatives. And an anti-war
farmer was elected county com-
missioner in Athens, Ohio, home
of Ohio University.

—A few candidates for Con-
gress and statewide ofﬁces clearv
ly won ontheir appeal to young
voters. In many cases, however,
older or more conservative can»
didates won despite immense
losses in areas dominated by
young voters.

The Rev. Andrew Young Jr,
40, the ﬁrst black congressman
from Georgia since Reconstruc—
tron, said young people were
essential to his victory. "I don't
think we could have done it
without the help of the younger,
more moderate voters in At-
lanta." he said.

'In this year of President
Nixon‘s landslide, the youth
vote made little difference in the
outcome of the presidential race.
Campus precincts almost uni-
versally went for Democratic
presidential nominee Sen.
George McGoVern, but this
strength was seldom sufficient to
carry counties or congressional
districts for McGou-rn.

More Liberal?

There were 25 million 18-t0-25
year olds eligible to cast their
first presidential election ballots
on Tuesday. About 11 million of
them wr-re Him-20 year olds
cnfranchised when the 26th
amendment lowered the voting
age in federal elections.

Some political analysts, includ-
ing ranking McGovvrn staffers,
had contended that young peo-
ple would be decidedly more
liberal than other voters and
could carry McGovern to vic-
tory. McGovern campaign ol'ﬁ

WASHINGTON AP—Jl‘he Bur-
eau of Indian Affairs Building is
back in federal hands after being
held for a week by militant
Indians and suffering damage
and loss estimated by the gov-
ernment at nearly $2 million.
But no one can say with cer-
tainty who won the strange
struggle or what it portends for
the future.

Many ofﬁcials are uncomforta-
ble with the precedents set, and
are uncertain whether the epi-
sode will worsen or improve the
long-troubled relations between
Indians and the government.

The White House and most
protesters were unmistakably re»
lieved to be freed from the
tightening circle in which they'd
trapped themselves: the Indians
refusing minor concessions in
exchange for their only bargain
ing point, the building, and the

Treaties caravan participants? Or
was it a spontaneous reaction, as

to Indians claim, to unexpected

problem such as ﬁnding housing

White House uneasily raising the
ante in recognition they would
use only words, not weapons, to
evict them.

“We didn't want another Kent
State in the BIA and we knew
damn well we'd have one if
police attempted a forcible ous-
ter of the well-armed Indians,"
said a White House spokesman.

One of the signiﬁcant con-
essions made by the WhiteHouse
negotiators headed by Leonard
Garment, Nixon's principal adr
viser on minority affairs, was to
agree to appoint a 20-person
federal task force to study the
demonstrator’s 20-point pro-
posal for reform

These questions remain to be
answered in the months ahead:

—Was the takeoVer of the BIA
building on Nov. 2 planned in
advance by the Trail of Broken
and food'.’

—Who really were these 300 to
600 caravan demonstrators?

—Whol led the mucking of
BIA files, pillaging of valuable
art and rampant damning of
property? To what extent will
they be held accountable?

—Will the demonstrating Indi-
ans be received back on the
reservations and in their urban
settings as martyred heroes, as
some of the Indians claim? Or
will they be outcasts who don’t
represent anybody and damaged
the common muse, as the White
House envisions?

—What is the future of BIA
Commissioner Louis R. Bruce,
who stayed with the Indians in
the barricaded BIA the initial 24
hours of the takeover?

—Why did the White House
promise the Indians amnesty from
prosecution for occupying the
building but not from punish:
ment for damaging it or for theft?
With what authority did it make
available $66,650 in cash to
speed the Indians' back home?

On The Commune...

dents are harrassed by locui
studs who hope to push the
hippies into a fight. Sometimes
their tauan are verbal, and other
times they pull knives, but fights
never materialize. The victims
are stigmatized us “chickens.”
Men with long hair are called
girls. Braless women are great
curiousities, and the reality of
seeing them coincides with
media-created images of "hippie
chicks." These signals arouse no
fear, though.

One afternoon, a caravan of
young and old Chicanos masque-
rading as hippies miirches up the
hill to the Kingdom. Some wear
head bands and beads, and
others have their faces decorated
with war paint. A bizarre funeral
parade, they climb the hill, say-
ing nothing. Commune residents
watch, trying to decipher the
message.

Is The Struggle Settled? Hard » .me A

WASHINGTON (AH—Hard
times are ahead for U.S. public
education during President
Nixon’s second term, the rid-
miniltration's top education
spokesman has told newsman.

“1 think this administration is
going to take a position of being
very spartan in virtually all de-
partments of federal government
and I am sure education will not
be spared," said Sidney P. Marv
land, assistant secretary for edu-
cation in Health, Education and
Welfare.

“We are in for some difﬁcult
times," the former U.S. commis-
sioner of education told a news
conference. “I am not prepared
nor do I know at this moment
how difﬁcult they will be but

 
  
   

  

I’m pretty sure they will be
difficult.”

Harland said the federal share
of public education running
about $6 billion annually or 7 to
8 per cent of total costs may not
decrease in the near future. But.
he indicated there may be a
rearranging of spending priori-
ties, with more money going for
research in the new National
Institute of Education.

Mnrland said the President has
made it elesr that he wants to
reduce inequities in the property
tax system for ﬁnancing educa-

tion, adding that this
“necessarily implies some role
for the federal government in
ﬁnancing elementary and secon-
dary education."

PRINCETON, N.J. AP m The
Gallup Poll says its next-to-last
pre-clection survey showed that
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy would
have made a stronger race
against President Nixon than
Sen. George McGovern.

Nixon led McGovern by 59 to
36 percent in the mid-October
survey. Asked how they would
vote if the choice were between
Nixon and Kennedy instead, the
same persons gave the President
only a 52413 edge, pollster
George Giillup said Sunday.

Kennedy's strength showed up
as early as December 1971,
when a poll showed him to be
the strongest potential candidate
among Democratic voters. The
Massachusetts Democrat trailed
Nixon by only 3 percentage
points at the lime, Gullup said.

Kennedy declined to be a
candidate, howcvr-r, iind hi-
campaigned for McGovern rifler
the South Dakota suniitor won

the nomination.

Gallup said the mid-October
poll showed Kennedy was
stronger than McGovern in sever-
al categories: among blue collar
workers, Kennedy lead Nixon by
53 to 41, while McGovern
trailed the President, 44 to 49.
Among Catholics, Kennedy led
Nixon 53 to 43, and McGovern
trailed him 37 to 59.

A group calling itself “Citizens
for Kennedy Committee" has
begun a drive for Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy's election for presi-
dent in 1976--but without his

sanction and encouragement.

Jeffrey M. Sternberg, 25, direc-
tor of the National Student
Union, said today the committee
will open an office in Washing-
ton in January. About 30 people
currently are involved, he said,
but declined to give their names.
