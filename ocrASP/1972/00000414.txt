“Atom Heart"-— Unsettling?

by Bill Brina

Last Friday and Saturday nites
the Dance Council presented a
most unusual interpretation of
“The Atom Heart. Mother Suite,"
twenty-three minutesot‘ the
music of Pink Floyd. The con-
ception itself was altogether ad-
mirable; Atom Heart Mother
fairly bets to be set to dance;
it’s definitely programmatic and
expressionistic enough to be
rich material for physical drumu,
yet it’s too abstract and non-,
specific to become any kind of
dramatic production per so. Best
of all, it's ambiguous enough to
lend itself to almost any imagi-
native interpretation.

What producer Steve Aminoll‘
and the dancers saw in tho

Suite, though, stretched even
the most. liberal bounds of inter-
pretation. Cited by shifts of
lighting that were uncomforta-
bly reminiscent of 2001, the
dancers shrieked and moaned,
played through ducts of attrac-
tion and repulsion, built minia-
turc social systems which
soomed to disintegrato on com-
mand from an external dynam-
ic, were alternately lifted and
flattened by the olecironlc
pulses of tho music, and ulti-
mately returned to their original
stasis. It was a startling concep-
tion, and to my non-export eyo
socmod oxtrcmcly wcll oxe-
cuted, yot it was ultimately un-
soltling. Unscttling, because it

settling, because it opted for the
easy cliche of portraying the
electronic pulse as physical pain;
insettling, because it. refused to
confront the nature of electron-
ic technology as an extension of
the way Man knows himself. 1
don't hear that in the music of
Pink Floyd, although I see it all
too often the way our cultural
avante~garde sees itself.

And Ono Note: All reviews are
subjective, of course, but this
one, due to the subject matter,
more so than most. Any com-
munications dealing with this
will be most wclcomc; it may he
as good it pliico as any to start it
dialogtic with you, the “cultural
consumor“ on this campus.

West, Bruce, 8f laing - finally

By Bill Brine

The first results of the summit. meeting of the kings of heavy
metal, otherwise known as Leslie West, Jack Bruce, & Corky Lalng.
are out. Yes, kiddies, right on time for the lucrative Christmas
season, here it is, “Why Dontcha" (Columbia KC 31929), the ﬁrst
installment from the mind-boggling $27 million (more or less)
contract that the boys nailed down. If you’ve been waiting for
something halfway intelligent with which to turn up the volume and
wreak revenge on all those Jams Taylor fans in your suite (or
apartment), this is it - it bushes, saws, and thunders in all the right
places.

If your tastes are a bit more eclectic, your reaction will be less
joyous. Oh, it‘s competent enough, all right, and some of it’s really
good. The opener, Leslie‘s “Why Dontcha," is a first. rate, full-blast
poundcr, and 50's “The Doctor," and we just haven’t had enough of
that kind of music done well of late. “Third Degree," an old Eddie
Boyd blues, gives Jack a chance to work out, and he proves that he
("all sing the blues, when he wants to, “LOVe is Worth the Blues" is
the masterpiece of the album, a riveting vocal by Leslie, and an
i-xquisltely layered instrumental break based on Leslie's “whale” riff
from “Nantuckct sleighr‘idc" that produces a total rush.

Too much of the rest, though, is ﬁller. "Out into the Fields"
sounds Iiko an nut-lake from Jack‘s earlier “Harmony Row" album,
(‘orky‘s dolnit us ii singer on “Turn Me Over" is competent but
colorloss, iIlNI Illt' loss said of "l’lousurc" and “Pollution Women" the
l)l‘Il(‘l' - ri-ml-mbcr “As You Said" from Dream's “Wheels of Fire"?
This band has :in onormous (Il‘ill of potential. They’re all fine
