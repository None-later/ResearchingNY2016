six major student productions
for the 1972-73 season. begin-

AFRICIIBBA

An exhibition by the members of AFRICOBRA will open at. the
State University of New York at Albany Art Gallery on Tuesday
Nov. 14. '

AFRICOBRA (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists) is a
Chicago-based group cooperative formed in I968 whose art strives to
express the styles and rhythms of black life. The artists say of
themselves, "Our people are our standard for excellence. We strive
for images inspired by African people/expericncr- and images which
African people can relate to directly without formal art training
and/or experience. Art. for people and not for critics whose
peopfeness is questionable."

Looked at from the outside, the work in AFRICOBRA comes
across an a strongly expressioniktic art whose creators convey
contemporary black experience and black history through powerful
outsize images that come at the viewer with the startling frontalily
of Byzantine icons.

Color is important to AP‘IIlCOBItA. .li-l'f Donaldson, Unt‘ of thr-
founders of the group says that the color is “color that shines, color
that. is free of rules and regulation s exprr-ssivvly awesome." In his
introduction to the exhibition t-atiiiouur- Donaldson, who is a
painter, speaks of “Coolitde colors,"

The exhibition shows work in a number of Thom“. Napoleon
Henderson and Howard Mallory niaki-s tapestries, “every fiber a
conducting vessel to hr- ri-irkoriotl Willi " 'T‘lii- viewers of the
exhibition are invited to “touch 'i-m and Ir-t 'r-in blow your mind.“

Barbara Jones who works in silk St'l‘t't'lilnﬂ chooses the medium
because it is important. lo the artists. that the work he inexperisivr-
and accessible to everyone. IIr-r styliLt-il images have thi- textural
richness and color of African fabrics and carry the message of black
nationalism

AFRICOBIIA will exhibit |)ltilillliﬂh of Nelson Stevens, Carolyn
Lawrence. Wadsworth rlltl‘l’i'l, aiiil (ii-raid Williams as well as i'tothiiiu

SUNYA Black Emmble and
Burundi Dancers, colorfully cos.
fumed and well rehearsed, treat-
ed the audience to folk dances
from Burundi, a small African
state. A violin solo by Helmul
Gnupner, a ltudent from Ger-
many, followed. More folk dan-
ciug, featuring the International
Folk Dance Club, the Ukranian
Club, and a Philippine group,
and a net of calypso songs per-
formed by Jim Bithop accom-
panying himself on guitar,
rounded off the ﬁrst. half of the
program-

'I'he second half of the pro-
gram began with a "Demon-
stration of International Cos-
tumel" ranging from an Indian
sari to American blue jeans, and
continued with more folk den-
cing-this time by the Chinese
Student Amociation, a Puerto

couple, and a Russian ensemble.
Technical difﬁculties marred the

ing. Good effects were achieved
by the previously mentioned
Burundis, and by the Ukruniuri
group, whose dance included it
couple of flamboyant gymnastic
solos. A little more rehearsal and
