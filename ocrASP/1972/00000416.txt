Soccer—A. Disappointing Season Revisited

by Nathan Salsnt

The soccer season ended last
weekend with Albany ﬁnishing
last in the university centers
toumement after losing both of
its games. Now it is time to look
back at what originally looked
like a very promising season.

Back in September, the team
opened its exhibition season
with some convincing play
against several established
schools like Colgate. The team
looked great, and this served to
raise hopes. Now that the season
is over, several comments can be
made about those games. First
of all, we can look back and
point out what was to be our
weakness all year-~lack of
scoring. We only averaged 1 goal
a game in those pre-season

games, and this was to be slight-
ly less than our season average.
Secondly, we can attribute the
team’s success to the other
team's poor condition which was
remedied as the season went on
and the excellent soccer we
played in those games which we
did not play during the season.

In our opening game versus
Geneseo, the pattern of the sea-
son vVas established-"the offi-
ciating want from bad to worse,
the team came out flat and
quickly fell behind, there was a
general lack of aggressiveness

 

and hustle, then a second half
resurgence which resulted in too
little and too late, many missed
opportunities, and too many
costly mistakes.

The only break in this pattern
occurred versus Queens, in a
game which featured 6 Albany
goals thanks to some unusual
hustle on several players’ parts,
and their totally inept goalie. We
played well enough to beat
Hamilton, but the refs gave that
one away. The loss to Oneonta
was expected due to their being
the No. l SUNY team by far.

The losses to Cortland, RPI,
Oswego, Stony Brook, and Buff-
alo were inexcuseable, especially
since we blew the lead in each of
those games. Our tie with New
Patlz showed how strong our
defense really was, and how
weak our offense was.

The season was highlighted by
outstanding play by Larry Her-
zog and Cliff Walzer. The second
half of the year saw the emer-
gence of Mark Solano and Leon
Sedefian. George Keleshian
never really came around for us,
partially due to his problem of

leaving games early due to a
disagreement with one of the
refs or an opposing player. Per-
haps the biggest disappointment
of all was Carlos Alvarez who
was billed as our star scorer and
offensive player, but fizzled
right from the start. The defense
was rounded out by John
Streeter, Bruce Michaels, and
Greg Macmillan. Karl Hauesing
starred at halfback in the tourna~
merit, but was a disappointment
in many of the regular season
games.

Unfortunately, last year’s
superstar goalie, John ’I‘hayer,
was plagued by injuries all year,
yet still did a good job in the
goal. Fifty saves might sound
phenomenal, but that is the
record he set against Oneonta.

So ends another disappointing
soccer season, our fourth in as
many years. However, thcrc is
hope for the future. Our star
defensive unit will all be back
next year, as will Leon Scdefiiin
and Cliff WHIZOI‘. Hopefully,

The Albany football team
which has beneﬁted from a num-
ber of breaks in some close
games throughout the season
had the tables turned on them
Saturday.

A questionable pass interfer~
ence call against the Danes with
just under four minutes to play
led to what turned out to he the
winning score as Plattsbu rgh slip-
ped by Albany 147.

As Coach Bob Ford's scoutcrs
had predicted, the game proved
to be a tight contest.

After both clubs exchanged 21
series of possessions in the first
period, Frank Leader came up
with a big play for Albany.
Leader blocked a punt and dch
on the bull zit l’lrittsburgh‘s ‘13
yard line.

John Bertuzzi, McCoy Alllslt'r,
and Marvin Perry took turns
racking up yiirdiigc to movv thi-
Dunes forward.

After six plays, Perry sprinlnd
hard to his left to put Albany on
the scoreboard. Mark li‘uilor
added the kick and Stiitc cn-
joycd a 7-0 lead.

In the second quarter quarter-
back Tim White of Plattsburgh
put on a classy passing cxliihi-
tion that got the hosts moving.

But two costly pcniillii-s
against Albany-a puss interior»
cnctI infraction and ii pcrsonzil
l‘oul callnhelpcd tlll‘ (iiirdinuls
along. Finally, a 21 yard touch-
down pass from Whiti- to Chris

Cringle capped the drive.

Jeff O‘Donnell was furious
that he was unable to break up
the play, but White's throw was
an unbelievably accurate pass.

The Cardinals faked a PAT and
went for a two point conversa-
tion but were unsuccessful in the
attempt.

As the half drew to an end, the
Danes mounted another scoring
threat. Lonnie Davis added some
punch to the ground gain and
once again Albany gol rolling.

Nocl Wiilkcr pickcd up it few
good blocks rind raced ahead for
a .11 yard giiin. Bi-rtu‘izi then hit
Bob Bzixtr-r on the 2H )ilrd line.
