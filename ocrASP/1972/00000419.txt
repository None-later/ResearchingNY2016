In California, the proposition
which would have decrimi-
nalized the use and possession of
marijuana, was defeated by a
two to one margin. Backers. of
the proposition had been opti-
mistically predicting ii cloxie
race~and had been expecting no
worse than a 60952-4096 defeat.
However, they announced they
will attempt to qualify ii similar
proposition for the next state-
wide election, predicting that
they will be able to pass the pot
measure (quate) “in another
election or two."

In Michigan, anti—abortion
forces defeated a proposition
that would have greatly liber-
itil'LCd abortion laws thcrc. 'l‘hr-
pro-abortion proposal also went

illy Inmates Riot

by Rich Kirkpatrick
Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA, PA. AP -
State police used tear gas Thurs-
day to quell a brief disturbance
at the huge Eastern State Correc-
tional Institution near here after
inmates assaulted three guards.
seized the maximum security
block and set fire to mattresses.

The rebelling inmates held the
block for nearly three hours.

Warden Robert L. Johnson
said the prisoners were unhappy
because they aren’t allowed to
ban: radios or television.

"We discovered that some in—
mates were making weapons

son said, explaining why they
were taken away several months

ago.
State Police Commissioner
Rocco Urella dispatched 60

troopers to the scene after an
emergency call from Johnson.

“We don’t have enough correc-
tional officers," the warden said.

The trouble erupted shortly
before 8:30 “.111. as guard Joseph
McCracken, 48, was escorting
the second batch of 35 men in
the block to the exercise yard.
He was knocked to the floor and
ﬁghting began.

Guards Thomas McCauley, 50,
and Herbert Williamson, 36,
rushed to McCracken’s side-all
were armed with small clubs-

demand that thtI United States

out of the block and lock the
door, preventing any escape.

Meanwhile, other inmates set
fire to themattresses, filling the
block with thick smoke.

The warden refused to release
the shouting men from the
locked block until sufficient
guards and state troopers were in
the area. and then only after the
tear gas cannisters were ﬁred.
This took place about 11 a.m..
less than three hours after it all
started.

The three guards were treated
for severe bruises at nearby
Pottstown hospital and then
went back on duty.

Fifteen inmates were treated in
the prison infirmary for smoke
inhalation, or for effects of the

tear gas.

Abortion

ALBANY, N. Y. AP -— An
intensive organizing campaign is
underway throughout the state
for a major counter-lobbying
effort against attempts. to repeal
New York State’s liberalized
abortion law.

The effort is being made by a
group known as Citizens for
Abortion Rights and Religious
Liberty, CARRL, a New York
City-based organization afﬁli-
ated with the New York Civil
Liberties Union and the Clergy
Consultation Service on Abor-
tion.

Anticipating what the group
believes will be another intensely
emotional campaign to repeal
the existing abortion statute.
CARRL's aim is to mount a
lobbying effort that will counter
the type of pressures put on the
1972 legislature by anti-abortion
groups such as the Right to Life
movement.

The 1972 session produced ll
repeal bill, but it was vetoed by
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. The
existing law allows a woman to
stick an abortion for any reason

during the first 24 weeks of
pregnancy. Opponents want
abortions restricted solely to

cases in which the molhi-r's lift‘
is in jeopardy.

Barbara Shack Will direct

year.

“We’re concerned that under
the pressure of Rigdit to Life
groups, there will be another
attempt made in the upcoming
legislature to criminalize abor-
tion,” Miss Shack said. “This
survey clearly shows that such
an attempt would be simply in
violation of the will of the ‘;
majority of people in this state."

CARRL ofﬁcials decline to :,
predict whether another repeal .
bill would be passed next year,
but they acknowledge that a
repeal measure will be ,intro-
duced.

“The right to life groups pro-
mised a primary fight against

those incumbents who voted H
against repeal last time but the ;
contests failed to materialize," I
Miss Shack said. “We also feel N

that because it was an election
year, many legislators voted for

repeal conﬁdent that Gov. ,
Rockefeller would Veto the 
measure." "

She said her group had been

unable to find a single candidate vl
for the Senate or Assemny who 
included his vote in favor of the , ‘
repeal bill as part of his cam- l

paign platform.

Several candidates who op-
posed the repeal hill did include
their pro»aiiortion stands in cam-
paign literature and discussed
the lliSUt‘ openly, she added, and
they were rl‘i‘llfﬂtt‘d.
