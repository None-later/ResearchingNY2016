“Everybody’s a yenta these daﬂ”

 

Since Miami, Radical Politics Lose Chic

by Rex Weinei
Alternative Features Service

New York City~Ncw York's a
desperate town these days, the
kind of desperation born of
boredom. Like shipwreck survi-
vors adrift, searching for land,
everybody seems to be asking
frantically “What's the next hip
thing gonna be?” For sure, in
New York, the good ship (Jourr
terculture has sunk.

You can't go anywhere in New
York these days without some»
body saying monotonously,
“The Sixties are over, Man."
Radical politics have become
definitely un-chie. Jerry ltubin
and Hut-y Newton caused barer
a right»on comment showing up
at a fashionable premieri- for
Jack Nicholson's tlt'W movie at
the NY. l"ilm Festival. At the
let-si-tty party afterwards at the
Ginger Man rcstauranl a wry line
of graffitti scrawled in the men's
room read “Jerry ltuliin votes."

New York politicos stirrcd
themselvos this past summer for
the Miami convontions, but the
activity, for the most part,
seemed perfunctory. Stickers
that appeared on downtown
walls urging attendance at the
Miami demonstrations seemed to
hang with half-hearted glue. The
Zippie contingent of the Youth
international l’iirty, based in
New York, tried valiantly to
inject some imagination into the
Miami effort, but the sort of
theater they performed has lost
its audience. A twanty-foot joint
hauled all this way up Fifth
Avenue last May caused a couple
of media giggles, and a Smoke-in
that was held in Central Park,
well...what else iii new? The Six-
tlm are over, man. A Junkie
Shootdn-ﬂew. that would've

been something!

Coming back after the Miami
ordeal (both Democratic and Re
publican) was like returning with
Napoleon from the sti-ppes of
Russia. “Shoulda stayed home,"
was a common opinion. i’eople
didn't know what to expect
when they went down there. But
they surely didn't expect such...
nothing. Devoid of real spirit,
lacking in creativity, empty of
any sense of new adventure,
empty of any sensiwthe Miami
demonstrations were plainly a
last gasp. And of course the
geriatric setting was perfect: the
Movvinent Went to Miami Beach
to kick the bucket once and for
all So bc it.

The aforementioned Zippics
tried to pull themselves together
upon returning to New York. in
addition to l'ollownig up on the
huge mailing list they had
gathered from the weeks in
Flamingo Park with a newsletter,
the Zips (lt'vis‘t-(l a plan to "bug"
the Nixon headquarters on the
fourth floor of the ltooscvr‘lt
llotel. Wearing masks and glovos
in imitation of the Watergate
crew, a party of ten actually
entered the mid-town hotel,
burst into the fourth floor and
released several jars of livv cock
roaches (thi- "l)ugii") much to
the befuddleinent Jl‘tﬂ‘t‘V‘mlrity
men. But the media never picked
it up as “news,” so of course the
whole thing was anouevent.
One night the windows of two
parked carii were smashed, not
an unusual event in this violent
city, except for the fact that the
cars belonged to Ed Sanders and
Jerry ltabinﬂboth Ylpplua.
Thereafter, some nervousness
ﬂickered at the Underground
Press Byndlcator office, a hang

out of the Zippies. Not that the
Zippics had anything to do with
the window smashing. But fac-
tionalism (not a cause of the
Movemcnt's death, as some say,
but really only a result) turns
out to be another souvenir
brought home from Flamingo
Park.

News of all this now ('irculatr-s
in New York primarily via gos-
sip, Everybody is a yi'nta these
days, and the City thrives on
rumors. There is no underground
newspaper, for one reason. The
[fat faded away long ago. Last
January the East Village ()lher,
surely one of the landmarks of
the counter culture, died of old
age and fatal di-bts on its seventh
anniversary. A new paper on
mediatcly sprang up the New
York Are, and for six months
and lllfll‘ issch and about ten
thousand dollars, New York had
a radical focus again but last
before siimiricr, the money ran
out. l'ind of party. Many ol' the
Arc pi-opli- wcnt to work at the
National Lampoon wliili- othi-ns
are Just hanging around, waiting

Waiting. Yi-ah, lllt‘ Sixties an-

'l'he Sixties are chr, the l“

way i see It) all that stuff is over
out of the way. The old idt'ntl
ties have merged with the main-
stream hip and hippie and yin
pie and radical and all that jazz.
A brand new character is now
set to emerge-"both culturally
and politicallyrand it will
probably have a great deal to do
with surviving the next four
years antler Nixon. 'l'hat'ii hip

To Off-Campus Students:

I would like to offer an explanation to those off-campus students

    

whose address and/or phone number are incorrectly listed in the
1972-73 University Directory.

The off—campus information forms, which many of 3“,“ ﬁlled om’
were designed by the Computer Center, Off-campus Housing Ofﬁce
and myself. These forms were designed to eliminate virtually 2,“
errors in the printing of names, addresses, and phone numbers mlhe

University Directory.

In a telephone conversation i had with Joe Scaring, l)irrui~[i,r).0[
Off-campus Housing, Scaring pointed out that his ni‘i‘ii-I- inrwﬂrded
the completed forms to the Computer Center as they were [l'('('|\'(id_
When asked for comment by Scaring, the Computer (‘miim tllll not
have an anSWeras to the cause of the foul~up.

Once again the bureaucracy has establishcd a pm «rim 1.,
"facilitate" matters, and then totally ignored the pl‘tlt’t'llll't‘ lit |.i\oi
of convenience. in short, future complaints H'ﬂtirilliig incorrect

[gangs should be referred to the Computer Center.

To the SUN Y/t Community:

it sccms to me that ever since l'vc been at SUNYA um tlmtll
seems to encourage every thing except education. Mosi oi 'n- .nurw.»
l've taken seem to exemplify this. For imp-um iln: liming}
Department discourages students from majoring in llI.i' l'n-lil in

making the lower leVel courses so intolerable that too Ill w. iIi-opli'
flunk out or withdraw. The professors encourage craniini no ii.illlit'
and competition but not learning. It is a Vt'ry uglx r-iu in 4n
through.

Last year 1 took introduction to Psychology only in ' ‘ml til
least 90% of the test material was based upon the text ll‘ w r I! ‘lisl
the professor merely alternated between his inim  .. iillll
“reading” the text. i don't think that many people lt'iii‘li '- w. iii-inn
treated as a sheet of computer paper five times during llir . "it"lt'l
and then haVc our ﬁnal grades determined by a coinpaiii . l 
done in this course. i hardly think we need to par iii-m u: ’m
that.

NUW 0M“? again, they are discouraging our educalion in.  at '“
rid us of some of our better teachers. I must admii ll i:  um
50m“ Very intelligent people as part of our faculty, but in. mm H!
them are not skilled at imparting their knowlcdgc in llll' « Iv. mm".

1 hope that when the university reviews an indivulual~ l"'~‘l"'” “‘
this school as a teacher, they remember that this is ,.n i-i! .i .iiiuniil
