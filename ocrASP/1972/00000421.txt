-'-j Berry

Raymond “Berry” Oakley. bass-player and occasional singer for
the Allman Bros. Band. died last Saturday iii a motorcycle crashjust
blocks from the spot where Duane Allman died last October 24th.
Berry’s motorcycle went but of control and plowed into the side of

a bus in Macon. Georgia.

It’s happened again. It's late Fall. and life is dying all around us.
getting ready for a cold, Itard winter. arid for the last three years it‘s
been fall when another firte musician falls in what should be the
prime of his life. Two years ago it was Jimi & Janis.last year it was
incomparable Duane. Berry won‘t be remembered with either, he
wasn’t that well-known; bass—players usually areii’t. But he will be

remembered.

Another motorcycle accidetit.
remarked, "He surely loved to ride too long. too far too hard. too
fast." At Berry‘s. I‘m sure someone will say tlte same. It‘s probably
the ettd of tltc line for the Allman Brothers Band. two deaths like
this are jttst too rrnrclt to take. At their peak. they were one ol‘tlie
fittest musical ensembles to grace the Idlld.i’llld they‘d only begun to
scratch the surface of their potential. httl the same blttes that gave
their music its inner drive arid urgency gave their lives a pace they
couldn't sustain. The power lliat lifted berry up smashed ltirti down
again. it‘s the Arnerrcati dreatir arid it‘s the American
nightriiare,..lhcy‘rc otie and ilic same. Play the blties

Someday perhaps ottr artists wtll learn to pace themselves. Will
learn to insulate the pain they play wttlr from the lives they lead. the
same way a chemist insulates a deadly vapor front lrts breathing.
Someday perhaps we‘ll create a society in which ilrosc of its wliosc
riervc»ends lie closest. most exposed. to the surface. don‘t have to
run blitidly in their pain Someday. perhaps..mcanwliilc...plziy the

Young View of Washington

Elderly Neglected

I reported that Congress finally
seemed close to passing legisa-
tion that would establish a Na-
tional Institute on the Aging
within the National Institutes of
Health.

And. indeed. after twelve years
of rejecting this much-needed
proposal to study the diseases
affecting the aged. Congress did
approve the measure in the clos-
ing days of the last session. Last
week. however. the President
announced his intention to veto
the bill because he views it as
inﬂationary and a duplication of
existing programs. He also ve-
toed a related measure to estab-
lish multi-purpose senior citizen
centers, extend volunteer pro-
grams for older Americans and
expand nutrition programs.

Thus. the elation of the bill's
chief sponsor. Congressman Wil-
liam L. Springer (R»lll.). was
short-liVed. Springer. who has
introduced legislation to estab-
lish a National Institute on
Aging in every Congress since
1960, was again rebuffed. this
time by the President himself. It
must be discouraging.

But how much more discoun
aging it must. be to America’s
older citizens whose needs seem
to have been forgotten by the
country they spent their entire
lives serving and who have yet to
find art effectiVe advocate for
those needs.

And their needs are many and
real Today. one iti th-ry tcn
Americans is (if) or older. and
more than three-fourths of them
suffer from at least one chronic
disease Ont-'llull‘ suffer from
two or mitrc. And as I reported
earlier. persons (35 or older are
twice as likely to be to wed of
medical care. and. once hos~
pitalizcd. tend to stay twice as
long as young people

'I‘o compound the malady,
their incomes are for the most
part fixed. and ﬁxed at a pretty
meager level: A fourth have in-
comes of under $3.000 per year
and of those living alone. hell
have incomes of less than
$2.000. That's not enough for
food. much less medical bills not
covered by Medicare and Med-
icaid.

Some of the supporters of the
Institute on Aging bill feel that
if Congress were in session the
President's veto would likely be
OVerridden. even though that
takes a twovthirds majority vote.
Unfortunately. Mr. Nixon em-
ployed the “pocket vr-to" to kill
the legislation merely by failing
to sign it within ten days after
Congress' adjournment. leaving
no chance for the legislative
body to overrule him. Now the
only avenuo seems to be a re-
introduction of the bill in the
new Congress sometime next
year - and that will start the
whole time-consuming process
over again. as has happened in
twelve previous years.

But even with all the attending
frustration it‘s worth it. By the
end of this century. 2H million
Americans will have reached or
surpassed the age of (if) - better
than one person in six. We can.
not afford to wait until then to
deal with the problems of the
aged. problems which sooner or
later affect all of Us who are
fortunate to live long enough.

Surely the elderly. already all
but forgotten by a society which
has no time or place for thusc
who cart no longer deep up with
its frantic pace. deserve more
than the thousand broken prom-

Washington Merry-Go-Round

iiNixon’s Four More Years

Next January 20. President Ni-
xon will begin four more years
in the White House. For the ﬁrst
time in his political career he
can follow his convictions with-
out worrying about the voters.

Some intimates say he has the
capacity for greatness during his
final four years. Others worry
that he is vindictive and might
use his new political freedom to
reward his friends and punish his
enemies. Here are our predic-
tions:

In foreign affairs the President
will dedicate himself during the
years ahead to achieving his goal
of .an era: of peace. He will
succeed. we predict lit with-
drawing the United States form
the wars in Southeast Asia. He
will also end the cold war era
and reduce tensions with the
Communist superpowers

Before his term is ended. we
predict the United States will
recognize Communist China and
restore normal trade relations
with both China and Russia.

He will fail. however to pre
vent war in the Middle East

At home. we predict the Pro
sident will revert to his basic
conservative nature arid go back
to a tighter money policy This
Will hold down inflation. til at
cost of nagging unemployment
and mild recession.

We also predict a Democratic
(‘ongress will dig deeper itito the
Watergate. l'l'l‘. grain and other
scandals. The President on t-lt-c
tron night went out of his way
to praise his two embattled cam~
paign aids John Mill'llt‘ll and
Maurice Starts who are Impli-
t'illt‘d iii the Watergate scandal.

This is the lip tiff that tho
I’rt‘sidt’til Will back tip lits tttdt-s
and cover up the scandal Mitch-
cll. we predict. will rt-mzun a
t'ltisc confidante but will not
return to the cabinet Starts will

be given it top appointment -
outside the cabinet.

In short. we predict Richard
Nixon will distinguish himself as
a peace president but will be
badly tarnished by scandal
during the next four years.

—HAVE JETSTAR. WILL
TRAVEL—

Globetrotter Henry Kissinger
could take a few travelling les-
sons from John Shaffer chief of
the Federal Aviation Agency.
Shaffer. we've discovered. is one
of the most travelled men in the
Nixon Administration.

Shaffer. who insists that it's his
solemn duty to “monitor the
national aviation system." ae-
complishes this goal by flying
around at public expense in a
sleek Lockheed Jetstar.

We have reported in the past
how Shaffer's “monitoring” has
taken him to such vacation spots
as Orlando, Florida. where he
played golf with Arnold Palmer.

Most recently. the FAA chief
flew in his government Jetstar
to Pittsburgh for the 25th anni-
versary of the Pittsburgh airport
Then he decided it was a nice
day for golf. So he flow across
country to his favorite golf
course at Augusta Georgia.
Tlll‘Pt' of his friends wanted to
go to Miami. So he ordered his
govrarnmettt pilot to drop them
off 300 mitt-s further south in
Miami.

We have learned the identity of
the thrct- t'rit-rtds- whom Shaffer
let usc his government plane.
'I‘licy arc 'l‘ltornton Fcrfuson.
President of Modern Air Trans-
port. Robert Lando. head of a
Pittsburgh advertising agency;
and Jay Van Vcclrteri. who
heads Larido's Miami office.
They flow to Miami while Shaf
fcr played golf in Aul'USta with
citt-cutivt-s of General Electric.

—INTELLIGENCE REPORTS—

GEORGE WHO? - The Chinese
public was told almost nothing
about the American election
campaign. The average Chinese
citizen, for example, never heard
of George McGovern. But a daily
bulletin. called Reference- News
has given the Chinese Commu-
nist cadres a surprisingly accur-
ate account of the campaign
developments. The re-election of
President Nixon, therefore. came
as absolutely no surprise to the
Chinese Communists.

Gay Opinion

by Mary Guliirr

Just a few quick thoughts this
week. As you may or may not.
be aware. there is yet another
dance this weekend. It would be
nice. of course. if alot of folks
came and had a gogd time
However. this is more than just a
pitch for another dance. It is a
brief inquiry into the notion of
community gay community.
We all know this is a year of
apathy, and that term has been
thrown around quite a bit in the
last three years So we ask only
that you consider a few things.

Who likes the bars'.’ Or rather
who admits they like the bars?
The general bitch is that the bars
are nasty. dirty. oppressive ex
ploitative. dehumanizing sexual
market places But that's where
people are. rtight after tiight
weekend after weekend. in Al-
bany. Boston, N.Y.(l.. or m .

Then there are those who
nevor go to the bars Some know
vr-ry few other gays. and are in
many instances quite lonely.
Some are afraid of being seen
and identified Others feel their
grtyness is not a major concern.
and busy themselves willi other
aspects of their lives There are
also the sympathetic tron-gays
who stay away for fear of being
rrrtsundorslootl. lalirlcd. or God
forlrid. apprtitit-ltt-d

It is possible that the need for
community has lit-cit vastly over
t-slirnatt'tl l’t‘rhiips most of its
already have all We want In any
citric. social :illt-r‘irttlivvs L‘HIIIIUI
continue in be titt'i‘rcd unless
thl')’ are supported Supplies of
money and l‘lll‘l‘g) are limited.
So: Bur people. downtown can
get along Without you for a few
hours. Closet people come out
and get it breath of fresh air.
Busy people. take some time to
show your solidarity. Everyone
else. turn out and dance with us.
