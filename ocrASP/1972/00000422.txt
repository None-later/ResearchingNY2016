The Berkeley Film House

by John Berger,
Alternative Features Services,

Berkeley, Califr-Without any
ﬁnancial resources to speak of, a
group of college-age men and
women in Berkeley, California
are recycling a once-defunct
30-room fraternity house,
turning it into a community
facility for the production and
nationwide promotion of fine
films by students and film ver-
sionaries.

The Berkeley Film House is an
entire community devoted to
film. Located within hailing dis-
tance of the University of
California on what used to be a
ﬂourishing fraternity row, it pro‘
vides room and board at rea-
sonable rates for people involved
in all aspects of film.

Members get training in film,
access to professional equip-
ment, and the financial advan-
tages of bulk film and equip-
ment purchasing, as well as con-
tacts within the industry.

The house provides or will
soon provide production,
processing, editing, screening
and distribution services, central-
izing all the facilities an inde»
pendent filmmaker needs,

Although they will not begin
ﬁlm production until January,
the Berkeley Film House is
already running a University of
California extension class in.

Records:

production, and conducts free
seminars for members. These
deal with sound, action, and
equipment for film plus docu-
mentary ﬁlmmaking. ‘

Organizers of the Film House,
however, are not narrowly pre-
occupied with the production
side of filmmaking to the exclu-
sion of the practical problems
related to film distribution and
employ ment in the industry.

A personnel service is being
extablished and a national film
distribution network is being set
up, Late this month, the Film
House will sponsor an exper‘
imental film competition with a
$500 ﬁrst prize; the first fifteen
best entries will constitute the
group's introductory film distri-
bution package. Prizes for the
contest are to be funded from
gate receipts obtained by the
Film House from contestants'
screenings.

Cut-rate film purchasing for
members is being made possible
through the negotiation of an
Eastman Kodak distributorship.
This alloWs the house to under-
sell most retailers in the area.

A primary general sourue of
revenue for the House currently
is rent and board paid by the

Gems Among
the Reissues

1972 has certainly been the
year for reissues, and in 1973,
they promise to appear even
more frequently. We can look
soon to repackages of all the
mid-60's English groups, now
that their options (most of
which were renewed for 5 years
in 1967) are beginning to lapse.

This means that the Searchers
material, for instance, no longer
belongs to Kapp in the U.S., but
reverts to Pye in England and is
available again to any American
company that wants it. With
Richard Nader planning an ling-
Iisli invasion revival show, as the
'(iOs begin to take on a nostalgic
glow and the Raspberries ride
the top of the charts, we can
probably expect these repack~
ages to do pretty well.

The first example is the recent
set of four albums from l’oly-
dor--I-leuuy Cream (3502), It't’lt'
Claplrm~~Al Ills Lies! (.1503),
(finger Ilalier~Al Ills [lest
(3504) and Joel: Bruce A! Ills
“('Nf (3505), Yes, the Cream and
associated stuff has gone to
l’olydor, and if by some over-
sight you have neglected to pur
chase one of the myriad albums
on Atco, and you don't mind
two records jammed into a single
plain white sleeve with no liner
notes or photos, then by all
means pick up these albums.

An equally shoddy reissue
much more in keeping Willi the
spirit of the music involvr-d is
The ()'.luyai (ireulcirl Ilils (ll/t

music has kept this group a

this album contains the l)l‘til of
their early stuff The only really
great song is “Lipstick ’l‘riices",
but then.- arc no real losers and
on the whole it’s ii very playable

Avuriciuus motives are okay
with me as long as they result in
the availability of more good

music. I wasn't aware that

had ever gone out of print, but

Aside from an excellent back
cover photo, there's not much to
look at or read on this album,
and little worth hearing for that
matter. Berry was never at lHllTll‘

the label are lacking in spirit and
originality, and despite whatever
worth their own records might
have, the Stevr' Miller liand

production facilities.

A screening room now under
construction also will be a
source of cash and a valuable
link to the community. Hope-
fully, the national distribution
network will also bring in
money; a store offering all kinds
of literature relating to film is
also being planned.

Even with all of these pros’
pects, the group still is not
content: they expect to under-
take the production of films on
assignment for industry,
government, and even the home.
Weddings may provide one
source of commissions.

Kenneth B. Belsky. the prime
mover behing this ambitious
undertaking, is a 22-year~old
who until recently had been

enrolled as a film major at the
University of California,
Berkeley, After only a few
months, however, his dissatis-
faction with the university's
failure to provide a film
curriculum stirred him to action.

He passed out a questionnaire
to 160 fellow film students con»
cerning the needfor a com-
munity film facility and after
getting a favorable response, he
set to work—without any
capital.

Literally talking his fantasy
into reality, Belsky interviewed
and consulted about 500 people
in business, academia, and
government. 'l‘hen, trading on
nativr- cliulzpuli, be rented the
$2,000/month frat house now
occupied by his group; he was
on the phone almost constantly
for three days until he found
people to fill all 30 rooms in the
building. Subsequently things
have gone so well that he has
taken an ill-room place across
the street from his first conv
quest.

Already, members of the house
include people in every branch
of cinema: script writing,
directing, acting, lighting,
camera work, and reviewing.

(‘rrandoise as many of the
Berkeley Film House projects
sound, residents appear well on
their way to realizing most of
them. When last seen, they were
getting ready to build a dome on
their patio, the site of a future
cafe. They're also starting a
library, a film ticket agency, and
an insurance service. it‘s all a
little mind boggling.
