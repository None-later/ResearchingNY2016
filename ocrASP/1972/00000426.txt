The Albany Great Dane bas-
ketball team opens their season
in fifteen days at Stony Brook.
After weeks of conditioning and
rigorous practice, and with a
scrimmage against the' U. of
Hartford under their belts, one
word can describe the attitude
of the Danes: eager. Eight regu-
lars are back from last season's
17-6 "rebuilding" squad. Along
with the five new varsity mem-
bers, they are capable of a great
year for head Coach Doc Sauers.
This is what the season should
look like.

Personnel

Probably one of the strongest
aspects of the team are the three
senior guards, co-captain John

Quattrochi, Bob Rossi, and Dave
Welchons. Labeled by Sauers as
the “soul of the team," Troch
can truly do it all: shoot, pass,
defend, and even rebound. Last
year he hit for over fifteen
points a game and wound up in
the top ten in the nation in foul
shooting. Perhaps his best attri-
bute though, is his quick thin-
king and leadership, and that
unique talent of controlling the
tempo of a ballgame. Bob
Rossi's story last year was a
chapter out of Grimm’s Fairy
Tales. Looking nothing short of
terrible in the opener at Will-
iams, Rossi came on to reveal an
outstanding outside shot, vastly
improved defense and a great
amount of hustle. He finished
the season with a 9.2 average.
The most consistent defensive
player on the court inevitably
turns out to be the last of the
trio, Dave Welchons. Brought up
to pass first, shoot later, Dave is

a great ballhandler with good
moves to match. His biggest
problem--he often doesn’t take
the shot when he has it.

The five returning big men
have one thing in common-~they
all range from 6'2" to 6‘4", not
big for a college front line. The
quickest of them is co-captain
Reggie Smith, who is much more
aggressive this year. He displayed
his assortment of shots, moves,
etc. and was very impressive
against Hartford. Byron Miller
averaged almost thirteen points a
game last season, showing signs
of greatness. He is a phenomenal
leaper, and will carry a huge part
of the rebounding chores.
Sharing the job at center will be
Bob Curtiss, Werner Kolln, and
Harry Johnson,. Curtiss, who has
a good outside shot, split the
position last year with senior
Don Joss. Like Miller, he must
rebound Well for the Danes to
win. Expected to play a lot at
both center and forward will be
senior Werner Kolln. Not an
overly adept hallhandlcr, Kolln's
strong points are his mobility
and board strength. Harry John-
son came on strong in the last
three games of '72, but showed
poorly in the scrimmage. His
most effective position is at ccn~
ter.

0f the “rookies,” Miami trans
fer Rich Kapner has progressed
the quickest. He's the fastest
man on the squad, but needs to
play a lot before he‘ll crack the
starting lineup. In a similar posi-
tion is guard Dennis ’l‘erry, a
very hard worker With a fine
outside shot. Mike Hill has been
through it before, playing varsity
three years ago. A good jumper,
Ilt‘ will play at center, probably
to I)l' used against very tall

teams. Fresh off the J.V., Jerry
Hoffman and Felton Hyche are
frankly in a “learning year," and
should see limited action.

Style

The Danes will “run as much
as they let us," says Sauers.
Attuned to a quick, patterned
offense, and an opportunistic,
pressing defense, Albany always
seems to be in motion-except
when they use the infrequent
sta-l-l. To compensate for the
perpelual disadvantage in height,
Couch Suuers has the boys dis-
ciplined to hurry the other
team's shots. This keeps the lane
uncongcsted, u must for state to
rebound. If Albany fails to do
this-it's trouble.

butes the poor away perfor-

they can't do any better at
University Gym. Dating back to
January, 1971, the Danes have
won nineteen in a row at home,
but they try not to think about
it.

Summary

Coach Sauers cites the team‘s
major goal: “to do as well in the
conference as last year. Realisti-
cally, we'll be hard pressed to
equal last year's mark. All the
competition will be tougher."
Those are the ever-cautious
words of Doc SauerH.The Danes
are a year older, a year tougher,
and a year smarter. They should
have an exciting, winning season
and possibly could be the no. 1
team in the area. The firsl game
is Dec. 2 at Stony Brook-the
first home game Dcc. Al ngninsl

A lost shoe caused the Albany
State cross-country team to end
its season on a disappointed note
in the IC4A’s last Monday. The
Danes had hoped to have fin-
ished ninth or tenth against 28
other schools. It was not to be.

Albany was in good shape can
ly in the race. Vinnie Reda was
up near the front and Jim Shra-
der and Bill Sorel were also in
the top seventy. Suddenly mis-
fortune struck Sorel as a runner
stepped on his foot knocking his
shoe off. After retrieving the
shoe, Sorel gamer tried to con-
tinue but his ankle did not allow
it and he dropped out.

John Koch, who would have
been the number six Albany
man across the finish line in-
stead, became’ number five. He
finished well back in 146th
place. This was approximately
60-70 places behind the spot
that Sorel probably would have
ﬁnished. The Danes were there-
fore knocked back to sixteenth.

As per usual Vinny Reda led
the Albany team, finishing an
impressive seventeenth. For Vin-
ny, a transfer from Fordham, it
was like going home and it was a
fitting end to a great season.

Not to make excuses for the
team but, it was an extremely
tough weekend. First, they had
the NCAA’s in Wheaton, Illinois
on Saturday and then this race
in New York City. A tired Coach
Munsey doubted that future A]
bany teams would attempt this
double.

With the season now ended, it

The disappointing finish in the
IC4A’s as mentioned above.

A team is only as good as its
individuals and they deserve spe
cial recognition.

Vinnie Reda had an outstand-
ing season for Albany. His re-
cord includes 2nd place in the
SUNYAC's, fifth in the Invita-
tional, and 17m IC4A‘s. Vinnie
and Sicna‘s sensation Joe Rukan-
shzigiza, have started a friendly
feud. Redii won the first but has
lost every one since then. This
feud should continue next year.
Vinny has been under some pres-
sure as he was billed as the man
to replace last year’s sensation,
Brian Quinn. Vinnie has come
through as a champion.

Jim Slirader has also had some
pressure on him. Coming from
the running Shriider family, his
brother is an All American at
Maryland, he was expected to do
a lot. He did less than expected
until the New I’altz met-t, whcre
he sci a new coursc record. After
that, he became the second best
runner on the squad. He finished
11rd in the SUNYAC's and ninth
in the Invitational.

Bill Sorel had a steady year.
“Mr. Consistency," he did a
great job all year as a runner and
also as a co-cziptiiiu.

Injuries again hampcrcd Nick
DcMarco. Nick who missed last
season with injuries run well
early in lIlt' your and then got
injured. The sccond luilf was ll
struggli- but he did do a great job
in both the SUNYAC's and the

John Koch another consistent
runner kept coming out and
doing his job meet after meet.
He was able to insure some key
wins by displacing opponents.

Two freshmen made the
Varsity this year. Carlo Chem-
bino moved in to take the fifth
spot on the team, while Phil
Doyle contributed fine perform-
ances and gained a year of ex-
perience.

There are two seniors who will
not return next year. John
Stantontried to come back this
year from injuries but was never
able to regain the form he had
two years ago. It was toolnd he
could not regain that form.
Scott Abercrombie, a top runner
last year never regained the form
of a year ago. He only showed
flashes of it during this season.

Next year, the varsity team
will be looking for its 100th
victory under Munsey. They
have 97 at this point. Only two
men are leaving so that the basic
part of the team will be back.
The varsity though may have a
worst record next year as they
are going to play the toughest
schedule of any team in this
school. Along with Army, Al-
bany also meets Syracuse in a
triangular mcct. Another new
meet added was one tentatively
planned with Holy Cross and
Williams. ’l‘hese meets along with
one against Colgate will be a
touin test for the Danes.
