The person who reigned over
the Catholic Church for two and
a half years as "Pope John the
Eighth" was actually a woman
whose term was cut short when
she died in childbirth.

Lawrence Durrell—who is best
known for his Alexandria Quar-
tet novels—has just completed a
book called Pope Joan. Accord-
ing to Durrell’s book, the ninth
century Pope broke with Church
law in more than one respect—
not only was Pope John the
Eighth a woman, she was not
chaste: during the day, Pope
Jonn reigned over Christendom's
faithful; but at night, she re-
portedly entertained a 20-year-
old paromour.

Although the Church has held
that the “Pepissa Joanna" story
is merely a myth, other writers
before Durrell have asserted that
Pope John was a woman. In-
cluded among these was a high-
Iy-regiirded Church historian
named Platinu, who wrote about
Pope Joan in his "Lives of the
Popes.”

Claude Lazevis' restaurant in
Paris has surprised almost every-
one by announcing that it is
operating at 11 profit after one
year of business.

Why the surprise? Because
Cliiude’s restuarant. called “The
Sampiere Corse," doesn't prov
sent its customers with a check.
Instead, eaters are told to pay
what they can afford. People
who are broke are actually en-
couraged to out without paying a
penny.

'l‘he Parisian restriurunteur Its a
dedicated communist who is
convinced that. pi’tlplumll‘ given
the opportunity-n‘etilly will
shart‘ what they have. The res-
taurant has no checks, no cash
registers and no cashiers. In-
stead, people merely put. their
money into an open cash box
and take out the change they
believe they are entitled to.

So far, the concept. is working.

paper and cans is such that the
monetary return would make
the program economical. The
going price, as of Nov. 6, is
twenty dollars a ton for cans and
ten dolliirs ii ton for paper, with
the cost of transportation being
piiirl by the purchasers.

Plan Laid Out

The major issues of the PYE
proposal involve the actual im-
plementation of such :1 program.
The plan is to institute it “two
IiilsltL‘I system" for paper recycl-
ing on the Podium and in the
residence balls. The system
would consist of two baskets,
one for "unclean" trash, the
Ullil‘i‘ for recy 'I’II1I(' paper.

" Recycling Efforts Need Support

$100 to help defray the cost. of
the program.

The case for recycling can be
defended on many grounds. It.
has been proven that the opera-
tion of recycling paper and cans
could return an ample monetary
sum, or, at worst, break even.
Through the recycling program
the University would receive a
great deal of publicity and com-
munity recognition. Most im-
portantly, the University would
be on its way to being an ecolo-
gically oriented institution with
illl ecologically awure popula-
tion.

Needs Backing

Currently, PYE is almost ex-
clusively responsible for Campus
recycling. Effectiveness and ef-
ficiency could be considerably
increased on 2i year round basis
if the Administration would aid
I’YI'I in insiiluiiiinalizing recycl-
ing on this campus. PYE could
then Clint'l‘illi‘illt‘ its activities
