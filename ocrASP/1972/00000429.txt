Boycott Stores Stocking Farah

To the Editor:

On May 2nd of this year workers at the Farah Manufacturing Co.,
San Antonio, Texas, called a strike. Within two weeks nearly 3,000
workers had responded and the strike expanded to Albuquerque and
Las Cruces, New Mexico. in the Sept. 11, 1972 issue of the New
York Times the company president swore “thnl. Farah never would
be unionized." Of course the company feels that. it is doing wonders
for the workers and that in the face of foreign competition it. cannot
afford union interference. At issue is the stark admission that at
Farah there is no collective bargaining on any level. The Company has
used every possible tactic to block federally supervised elections
where workers could exercise this basic freedom of choice.

in this atmosphere production demands can he set by the company
as high as they wish, and they can fire the worker who Cannot
physically stand the strain. Workers claim that wages increase only
when and if the company wants. Mexican-American women who
comprise the vast. majority of the work force, have complained that
the maternity benefits are far from adequate and that when they
rtrturn to work, they would lose their position on the pay scale and
alert tlh‘ beginners. The average annual lnCtintt' for all clothing
employees is only $4,300. Subtracting the highly paid supervisory
anti managerial ptmilitmra, who are Very wr-li paitl, ii. is figurt-tl that
the great, bulk of clothing workers earn Closer to $3,500 a your or
about $69 fl week. Much smaller local (“onipanII-s in the area which
are unionized pay in the area of l}; lU‘J/wrwit.

The whole picture involves numI-rous Violations of basic socrai

Dr, Ehemann Willi appointed to
the department. its an Associate
l’rofaanor in the Full of 1970.
Because of unIVerrIity regula-
tiuitu, Dr. Ehemann WuH re-
viewod for tenure in the Full of
lli7l, in which cutie tenure was
denied. The rationale generally
given wart that there wart lacking
a uufficienl body of favorable
student support (via utudent

The three basic criteria upon
which decisions of tenure are
based are (ll students evalua-
tion, (2) service to the depart.-
meni and community, (3) scho-
luriy ability, Obviously in Dr.
Ehemunn's cutie the first criteria
is fulfilled. His service to the
department is unquestionably of
high quality. Ati demonstrated in

Dr. Ehemann has superior com-
mand of both Econometrics and

the few professors who can of-
