by Bill Heller

A key man, if not the key man
to a big season for Doc Suuer’s
Great Danes has developed a con-
troversial history in his two
years of playing hoop here. The
man is junior, Byron Miller, and
What‘s happened to him is
enough to make one take out
the old violin and handkerchiefs.

Hot out of Gloversville High,
Byron came to Albany in l970,
to score 63 points in his first
three games for the freshman
team. But then disaster, in the
form of NCAA bureaucracy,
struck. The results of Byron‘s
SAT‘s showed that he didn‘t
predict the minimum NCAA
standard of 1.6. So he was
forced to sit out the rest of the
season. It muttered little that
Miller wound up with over a Hi
for both his trash and sopho-
more years, What counted was
that “reliable” prediction. I‘low
(lid he feel about the whole
thing? “I was disappointed
because I was just getting into
playing, I missed all those games
my freshman year. It was a
whole year‘s loss. something I'd
never be able to make up."

With only 3 games experience
from his freshman year, Byron
nonetheless found his spot on
the varsity last winter. He went
on to become the leading re
bounder, second high scorer,
and earned additional honors.
such as MVP of the Capitol
District Tournament and ECAt‘
Rookie of the Week.

It's often said that lightning
never strikes in the same spot
twice, right? Wrong. As the end
of the I7l-‘72 season

approached, Byron and his team-
mates seemed destined for an
NCAA bid. Seemed. Although
Byron missed 17 games as a
frosh, the NCAA decided it
wasn’t enough. They somehow
reminded themselves that
according to the “1.6 prediction
rule,“ Miller shouldn't have
played in any games in his ﬁrst
year. In a special ruling, they
declared Byron ineligible for the
last 3 games of ‘72, and the
Danes subsequently ineligible for
post-season play. This, then, is
Byron‘s legacy from the past.

I ran into Byron just before
Thanksgiving and posed a few
questions to the big forward.

ASP: “What do you think
about this year's team?"

MILLER: "Overall we’re
stronger an experienced ball-
club. 'I‘his'll have to he the year
we put it all together. It‘s a
tough team,"

ASP: “Because of the depth
and talent of this squad, you
may have to split your playing
time How do you Vit'W this""

can gi-t the Jtll) dour- No lrrrll-
