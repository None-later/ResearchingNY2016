COME (IVER AND
PICK OUT THE
PERFECT

by Audrey Seidman

Even representatives of the “al-
ternative press" have their differ-
ences, as a group of students
found out by listening to mem-
ber editors Leon Van Dyck and
Lenny Perlmutter at a discussion
sponsored by the Seminar 'in
Journalism course.

Van Dyck, formerly editor of
The Liberator, now edits The
Nortlisider, the newsletter of the
North Side Advisory Council of
the Whitney M. Young Center in
Albany's Arbor Hill. Perlmutter
edits the ll’asliington l’ark Spirit.

The main difference between
the speakers seemed to be their
vieWs of the role of advocacy
press. Van Dyck, who writes
mainly for Blacks but sells
mostly to Whites, sees his job as
exposing evil, people misusing
power, and judging them. Perl-
mutter says he writes for old and
young, (lay and straight, Black
and White, He runs his paper
more as a dialogue, believing
there is some good and some bad
in everyone, including politi~
clans.

Major points, such as the need
for community newspapers were
readily agreed upon. Van I)ka
pointed out the single-ownership
of most papers in cities including
Albany, resulting here in similar
Republican editorial policies, He
emphasized funding as the main
problem in running an “alter
native paper." The methods of
selling advertising space, sub-
scriptions and street hawking all
havv their “technical problems."
This is especnilly true when an
editor writes something dcroga
tory concerning an advr-rtiser.
Pi-rlmiitti-r, however, cited the
gooil relationship bctwn-i-n his
paper aiiil the Price Chopper
store, who's nonunion lettuce
he has boycotted.

l’i-rlmuttt-r's talk emphasized
philosophy lle t)])t'llt'(l by
saying he was "intimidated by
words," but did iiol seem to lie
so as he espoused many about
his fantasies of a community
paper. The Spirit, named for a
“metaphysical, organic con
ccpt," is a result of "something
one feels within in relationship
to the l't'sl of the community "

Both i-ililors, l’i-rlmiittcr

Seminar Hosts Editors

noted, had to start from “go.”
His paper was free for the ﬁrst
six months of publication since
beginning in the spring of 1971.
He later raised money by (lis-
cussing the concept of commun-
ity with local residents and ad-
vertisers. The Washington Park
area was played up as something
real, part of his “new reality.“
According to Perlmuttcr, when
the Capitol papers left the city
for the suburbs, the small things
were lost, especially the people.
Now the Capitol press is return»
ing some attention to tilt‘ Park
area. Ht' also tried to incorporate
the university into his coni-
munity. In sponsoring Wents
such as the Pinksterl'i-sl, the
Spirit becomes an integral part
of the community,

Van Dyck's efforts in The
Liberator were aimed to “edii-
cate people to the landlord,
housing commissioner. legis»
lators..." Yet alternative papers
must beware, as Perlmuttt-r
pointed out, as they often go
under because they “talk to
themselves." The credibility
problem, according to Van
Dyck, also haunts the “alter-
native press." These papers are
expected to show more facts
than the establishment press in
order to be believed.

l’crlinutter brought up the
problem of political endorse-
ments. His prc-clcction editorial
gave the pros and cons of Hindi
dates running for local office,
not naming a definite choice for
office. Van Dyck brought out
his paper and l‘tricil to not be
objective " llis‘ volunteers
tended to be the "politically
(lt'll‘llll'd students." 'l'wo of The
Liberator's best stories \K'l'l't‘ Van
Dyck's llllti~ll'll‘tl‘llltltillt‘ article.

Both journalists tttll't'l' the pub
lication of an alternative paper is
a trying endeavor in asking peo
pie to look at things in another
way. l’crlmiitti-r's paper has built
up from his fantasies to almost a
profit making organimtioii. yet
he lives “day to day Willi the
fact that if the paper got-s
under. that's cool."

touisiana Aftermath

Faﬁy Fired For Support

(CPS) — University officials at
Louisiana's Southern University
moved last week to fire several
faculty members suspected of
siding with students in the con-
flict which resulted in the deaths
of two black students.

University President la-on
Nt-tterville, who has been ltt'
cused of calling in armed polici-
to the campus, dispatched dis
inissal notices to two professors
and is suspected of dismissing
four or five others.

Both professors who have been
dismissed had spoken in support
of student demands, including
the firing of Netterville as pri-si
dent.

Dr. Joseph Johnson, head ot
Southern'i. PhysiCs Department
and one of those dismissed.

Investigations Begin

by Tom Jory
Associated Preu Writer

BATON ROUGE‘ La. AP - A
memorial service for the two
black students slain at Southern
University drew 400 people to
the steps of the state capitol on
Sunday as two independent
commissions prepared to begin
full-scale investigations of the
Nov. 16 police-student confront-
ation at the school.

About 400 blacks assembled
for the hour-long rally. Leaders
said it was in memorial for the
two dead students. John E.
Brown, who told the crowd he
had organized the event, said,
“The very existence of the black
race today is threatened."

Brown said several national
civil rights leaders had been
invited to speak, but he said
none was able to iittend.

Focal point for the activity
was the 30 minutes of violence
on Nov, 16 which exploded as
officers chased students from
Southern's administration
building. Denver A. Smith of
New Roads, La., and Leonard
Douglas Brown, Bilbert, La”
both 20, were sprayed with
buckshot and died of head
wounds. Authorities contended
at the start that officers fired
nothing but tear gas. Later,
however, they conceded that. an
officer could have mistaken a
shotgun cartridge for a tear gas
cartridge.

Only the l‘l-member com-
mission appointed by the state's
attorney general, William Guste,
could boast legal status and at
least access to subpoena powers.

But organiZcrs of the Black
People’s Committee of Inquiry,
outwardly skeptical of the of-
ficial investigation, said they,
too, would make their findings
available to authorities.

(lov. Edwin Edwards
announced over the weekend the
security force at New Orleans
would be beefed up for the
resumption of c Isscs, but be
discounted warnings from dis
sidents arid said he believes the
majority of thestudcnts wniit to
return to their studies.

Students havu demanded ' Hire
of a voice in the ildnlllllﬁtlitlulll
ot' lllt' nation's largest black
university, and huVe called for
the resignation of the school's
lift Vi-arold president, Dr (i.

 

Leon Netterville.

Two Southern-New Orleans
students are on the attorney
general's investigating com-
mission, as well as Revius Or-
tique, a black New Orleans attor-
ney and former member of the
Presidentfs Commission on
Campus Unrest, Jackson and
two other blacks.

Whites on the panel include
Turner Catledge of New Orleans,
retired executive editor of the
New York Times.

The black people’s committee
includes Georgia state Rep.
Julian Bond and two black
Berkeley, Calif., city council-
men.

 

FACT
OR
FICTION?

You should avoid exercise
during your period.

Fiction! The simple rules of
good health are always im-
portant, especially during
your period. Exercise, a
proper diet and a good night’s
sleep go a long way toward
relieving menstrualcramps
or preventing them alto-
gether. And remember,
you’re not “sick.” So there's
no reason not to follow your
normal routine.

2

There’s no odor when you use
Tanian tampons.

Fact. With Tanian tampons,
odor can’t form. Odor is no-
ticeable only when the ﬂuid
is exposed to air. With
Tampax tampons, ﬂuid is ab-
sorbed before it comes in
contact with air; therefore,
odor cannot form.

3

You should no! bathe during
your period.

Fiction! Contrary to super-
stition, water can't hurt you.
Daily baths or showers are a
must throughout your period.
Shampoo your hair, too. And
don’t deny yourself the
chance to go swimming.
Tanian tampons are worn
internally, so you can swim
anytime.

4

Single girls can use Tampax
tampons.

Fact. Any girl of menstrual
age who can insert them
easily and without discom-
fort, can use Tampax
tampons with complete con-
ﬁdence. Follow the easy di-
rcctions in every package.

Our only Interest In proteclliia you.
