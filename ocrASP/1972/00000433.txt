This is the city: Albany. New
York. The state capital is here.
So is a port, a lot of banks, a few
small industries, and about
130,000 Albanians. 3

Some people don't like Al-
bany. They're mostly dissatisfied
students and downstate legisla-
tors who spend only part of each
year here. They complain inces-
santly about the cultural waste
land, “hick town" atmosphere,
and the general lack of excite-
ment in the capital city.

Then there are those who real-
ly don't find the city so objec-
tionable at all. Albany certainly
has its share of faults, but on the
whole they see it as little worse
than any other American city its
size. “Look at Alburquaque,
New Mexico or Urbana, l'lllnios"
they tell us. “What do these
cities have that’s so excep-
tionai?"

They want to know why Al-
bany is always singled out for
extra criticism.

Case in point: A story ap-
peared recently in the Sunday
New York Times Travel Section
headlined, “is Albany a Capital
Offense?" The question was rhe-
torical as the story which fol-
lowed was essentially a rehash of
the oft-cited terrors of living and
working in the state capital. The
lead set the tone for the entire
story: “You ‘re in Albany either
on business or by mistake."

Urban ills

But is Albany really so much
worse than other American cities
of comparable size? Albany
backers point out that it merely
shares with most every other
city the usual plethora of urban
ills. it's not unusual, they claim,
that all of the major downtown
department stores have closed
down or moved to the suburbs.
Or that the major downtown
hotels have gone out of business
or become severely dilapidated in
the 'face of stiff competition
from suburban Holiday inns.

As in so many American cities,
Albany‘s tomblike railroad sta-
tion stands empty and splotched
with pigeon droppings, a stark
testament to days of heavy rail
traffic.

The city backers point to the
main business thoroughfare, Al-
bany's State Street is nothing
but one long row of banking
houses, a situation which is com-
mon in almost every American
city, it's beginning to look a lot
like Fifth AVcnuc. Even the
names of the banks are the
same: Chase Manhattan, Bank‘ of
New York, Banker's ’i‘rust,
Chemical Bank. A few small
stores hang on, thanks mostly to
the lunchtime crowds of office
workers.

As in numerous American
cities, the riverfront area has
been destroyed by the building
of massive arterial highway
systems which whisk workers
into the city a little faster after
work. Which means they don't
have to see much of the city

either way. Nice for the comv
mutcrs. Not so nice for the
downtown merchants.

And Albany has its share of
deteriorating brownstoncs, ugly
high rise low-income housing
projects and urban crime.

All of these afflictions are not
uniqucto Albany.

Things Get Done

indeed, Albany may actually
be better off than a lot of other
towns. Yes, there are some dif-
ferences, Unlike many other
cities, the police do answer calls.
The fire department responds to
alarms, and neither iii seriously
undermanncd.

Garbage is collected from
every neighborhood. The streets
are cleaned; the snow somehow
gets plowed. in short, the city
functions, which in this day and
age is something to brag about.
The city government may be
“corrupt and rotten", but the

Scenes like the one above are more and more common in Albany commercial areas as

State Street is the heart of Albany‘s central business district. The street is increasingly
being dominated by banking offices as retail stores go out of business or flee to the
suburbs. Consequently, streets are empty after 5:00 PM, when office workers are safely at
home in the suburbs

 

Albany's riverfront area has been seriously affected by the building of massive arterial
systems effectively preventing access to the river for citli residents. The expressways are
beneficial, however, to commuters who can whisk to and from downtown offices Without
stopping in the city itself. Nice for the commuters. Not so nice for the incrcluinls.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

average citizen here really
‘doesn't care. As long as his street
is plowed and his taxes don't go
up, he'll be satisﬁed. The Albany
machine knows how to please.

Albany is a slow city. The pace
is langorous. it is a middle-
American haven. The people

_ don't have to face crowds, sub-

ways, junkies, or high crime.
True, they are somewhat iso-
lated from a lot of mainstream
America, and most of them ap‘
pear happy. Happy, perhaps in a
provincial sense, but happy
nonetheless.

Living in Albany is a lot like
turning the clock back 20 years.
Albany in 1972 is a lot like the
aVerage American city in 1952.
The government is somewhat
archaic, but things do get done.
The city is not falling apart.

Hopeful Construction

This is not to say that Albany
is completely stagnant. There are
even optimists who see a “bright
and prosperous" future for the
city. They base their hopes not
on the massive South Mall pro-
ject, but on several other recent
developments which could go far
toward revitalizing the city core.

Most important of these is the

is iliat all sUch information

'i‘ccvan recommended that if
students so desired, they could
conduct their own evaluations
and make the information pub-
lic. However, he feels that if a
professor was against this, he
would not ho obligated to sacri-
fice class time for it to be done.
Students would have to contact
their classinatos outside of class
to gather evaluations. There
would not, be emphasised, bo
any restriction on releasing any
information gathered in this
manner.

Research is so important, in fact,

One problem being encoun-

ment is the faculty-student ratio
The department reportedly has
one of the highest ratios in the
entire Uiichrsity. This is partly
the result of large class sizes, and
the many nursing and speech
