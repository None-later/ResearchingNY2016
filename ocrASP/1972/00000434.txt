Japanese poetic forms have

and does not require familiarity

R.A. Job: like So

by Aralynn Abare

Resident Assistants here were
once paid room, board, and tui-
tion. Now. they get only room.
Despite this fact, at least Five
senior R.A.'s would make the
same choice if they had it to do
over again. ’I‘heir reason is not
the pay-~it avorages out to about
$20.00 a week-- nor the prestige
of the job, which can he, as one
ILA. explains, “like washing so
many pots and pans." Why
then?

“You do get put on the spot
sometimes, and there's nobody
to hide behind," he admits. Like
the time he was amidst 30 guys
and about the only one who
didn't want to fight. “I‘m just
thankful I got out of it alive..."
He‘s found the best approach to
be an easy going “I-live-
herevtoo," as, with the section
constantly reminding him that
R.A.‘s “ain't much," any other
attitude would be relatively
stupid.

“Ease into the administrative
stuff."

The only sounds in Ginny
Roth‘s section are a soft murmur
of female voices and the non-
descript classical record playing
on her stereo. Ginny. now in a
low-rise sorority section, is a two
year veteran. “When you're a
24-hour babysitter, it's difficult
to find time for private mo-
ments." Ginny considers herself
a “private person." “I’m not an
instigator, and it’s hard for me
to play a let's-get-to~know-each-
other role," she admits. She sees
an importance in knowing her
section, but adds that l‘in many
cases it's impossible," and that
an R.A. should respect a per-
son's right not to have anything
to do with you."

In his freshman dorm, Dave
l’reiich sees himself arbitrator,
socialim-r, and general instigator.
“Things like water fights and
impromptu trayiiig iii the snow
help make a section very close."
he explains, Cathy Blumberg, a
downtown ILA. last year, feels
much the same way. “I was
more than lust a holder of keys-
-\vhicli l Iike....l“reshmeii don't
know about anything or any~
body..,You're really needed,"
she points out. She holds that
upperclassmen are usually “set,”
but that freshmen, though some
will go off on their own. are
anything but “set.” l"l'hey'll ac-

cept differences, they know
they’ve got to if they are to
survive." "You're looked up to
in a I' shman sm'lion,"l)ave
claims, “and you'll soon find out
What ego-tripping is."

  

"lfresli
men are on an independence

hinge, and they don't know hou
to handle it," he continues.
"'l'he first two Wei-ks are spent

Although they both worked,

be a split. but there isn’t; and let
me tell you what a great feeling
it is to see this come out in
things like a kid in a wheelchair
dancing at ii section party."
Differences exist within these
five, but so do similarities. For
instance, all feel a comradie for
the rest of the residence staff.
Jack considers one of the best
parts of the jol) is the ‘in' to
meet the other 25 residence
people on the quad. “They're a
mixed bag. One is married; there
are artist-types, independents,
greeks. I expected a lot of ‘social
butterfly' types, but got to meet
25 new and different people; it's
nice." Ginny considers the staff
the best part. of the job, and
Davo attributes them with “rent
ly making you look at yourself
like you tit-Ver looked at yourself
before." Also, all like having
their own room. Ginny ranks it
second as to what she like best
about the job, Jack warns. how-
ever, to forget it “if you're just
doing it for the money or for the
room." He points otit that
“You'll find it's not worth it--
especially when some guy is yell-
ing outside your window at I
a.ni to let him in because he
can't find his l()('k‘l)l)X key."
And this is not the least of the
problems these five face
l“(ii'en‘teti.sl is frustration. For
Jack the pinnacle was when “a
kid stole Siilllllltl worth of his
suitemate'ssluft' He'd been kick

worst part of the job, then is
Chuck Fisher." For Dave, it‘s
policy “never made clear to us
that we are expected to know.
interpret and carry out.”

The drug policy seems to be
the most bafﬂing. “What's logi-
cal about a policy that gets me
into a situation that calls for
yelling at a guy with a joint in
his hand to return the chair he's
sitting on to the lounge?” asks
Chuck. “You can't be arrested
on the campus fo'r plain and
simple soft drug use," says Jack.
“yet we’re supposed to ‘educate'
people by explaining the pen-
alties. That’s ridiculous.” The
entire battle seems a losing one.
Statements like: "’Ihere are exactly
four straight guys in my whole sed-
tion" and “l was shocked out of
my mind to disCoVer I had
straight kids in my section"
seem the trend.

Administration seems a hassle.
(,‘liuck doesn't think R.A.'s
should sit duty at the tower desk
or have master keys. “The only
things I do when I’m at the desk
is to answer calls for people‘s
phone numbers," he complains.
“and it's a pain in the  to let
kids in." Another R.A.. despite
her closeness to the staff, resents
their irresponsiblity towards
things like getting to duty on
time, opening or closing the
laundry late. and not showing up
to meetings. “People have been
fired for this who were fabulous
in their sections," she explains.
"but the administrative stuff is
part of the job too." Dave warns
:iiiy ILA to be prepared for
these “little bullshit things." Be-
sides this, these l{.A.'s haVc a
