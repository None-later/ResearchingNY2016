“find the collective source & build”

Breaking Down All Those Walls

by Steve Nover

'l'hough the university has a so
called peace studies, a student
(.‘UUIIL‘II, anti many organizations;
it certainly seems that so much
more can be done here in Al
bany to create feelings of mutual
understanding and co-opcration.
Though the path is very narrow,
the yellow brick road is very
wide and we are all on it, wheA
ther we realize it or not, There
are many people who have got~
ten together and thus we are
able to say that We do have a
Refer, a 5300, a day care center,
draft counseling; and the needs
and problems of many different
people in varying spheres are
being cared for. Certainly we
need more people to give their
time and energy which is semi-
precious because of school and
personal relationships. But how
can an atmosphere of good will
and concern he brought to Al-
bany, with eVeryone taking part
and committing themselves to
making their community an ex-
pression of their beliefs, ideas
and hopes? Or rather, the feal~
ings are here already in many of
us and some kind of sensitive
stimulation that touches all of us
is needed to produce this new
community, to create this Crea»
tion.

Chnstmaa is coming up, and
w crcver we'll be spending it,
t era's a kind of excitement imd
closeness, but how far into the
new year will it last? Does the
spirit just come and goﬂcun it
actually be integrated in some
part of our being with abutting
effect? Exactly how We devote
our energy and what course of
action we take dopenda upon
ﬁnding our center and than
working from them. So we have

 

to find our individual renter and
then perhaps find our collective
source and build. Itather than
get more abstract, 1 wish to call
attention to some points where
change is needed and hopefully
it will set tiff a cataclysm of
events as we become more con-
scious of our Self and sensitive
to the environment.

How we use colour, in the way
we dress, in the environment,
how they affect us, is a kind of
psychology. Just as how We re-
late to one another will decide
whether we help open each
other up and expand, or whether
we do the opposite hacking
away, slirivcling, contracting
elosrng ourselves up so it is With
colours they cart relax us,
soothe us, be arousing or they
can put us to sleep. Being on the
campus and seeing the architeu
lure has an effect upon us, be-
sides whether we see boring |ifc~
less faces or smiling enthusiastic
people,

The SUNY buses which parade
around the city one hundred
times a day could use a change

about a day of dress colorfully,
