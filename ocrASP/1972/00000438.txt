Guarneri Quartet Plays to Full House in’ PAC

it gets to the point where the Guarneri Quartet is just too good to
be true. They.played a concert here Tuesday night which demon-
strated their musical capacities, as well as their intestinal fortitude.
Arnold Steinhardt, the first violinist, was suffering from a multitude
of colds, fins, and whatever else one can contract, yet he played an
acceptable concert. It was not perfect (some people hrrd the nerve to
grumble about the two scratched notes he played-probably the same
people who think the Albany Symphony is the World‘s best),but it
was still incredibly musical.

The Guarneri can play anything well. The Mozart Quartet is a nice
piece, one that challenges the intellect if not the pure physical skill.
it is a different piece to animate; the music must not only be played
accurately, but it must be played with an abundance of feeling. The
Guarneri seems to reﬂect over the music while it is playing it. The
pauses in the ﬁrst movement were impeccable-if someone was
working them by strings front above the stage it couldn‘t have been
cleaner.

It was in the Bartok Quartet No. (i where the Guarneri showed
their top form. It is a work ofa different language than the Mozart.
it does not convey its message iii R-lrar phrases and tonic-dominant
relationships. it is a piece unto itself, and with its five sister works it
constitutes one of the rrrost important bodies of chamber music eVer
written (more critics and rrrtisicologists arc jumping on the Bartok
bandwagon every day).

The rhythms are the irrrportaril thing. especially in the wonderful
third movement. where the dotted rhythms are thrown about with
delightful results. The adorable violin theme (using harmonics-not
unlike the falsetto voice iii application) added a new dimension, one
of folksy humor and compassion.

Bedriclr Smetarra wrote exactly one quartet of any worth. He
called it “From My Life," and threw into it musical portraits ofhis
first wife, his court apprenticeships, and his eventual deafness. it is
trtily, and the warm tones of the Guarncri are well-suited to it. Davrd
Soycr‘s cello is one of the monuments of chamber playing, and

10h“ Dallcy's violin sound is mellow and warnr. And last, but not at
all least, is Michael Tree. What a violist!

The Guarneri Quartet is probably the best in the world at this
time. it was our fortune to have heard them at this, the start of what
rrriglrt be the greatest quartet of all time.

Young View of Washington

Another Vietnam

An entire generation of Ameri-
cans has grown up during an era
when this country was partici-
pating in a war viewed as unfor-
tunate at best and wrong at
worst. While the long-term af-
fects of that war on the future
of the nation remain to be seen,
one sobering conclusion can be
drawn: It could easily happen
again unless Congress moves to
assert its Constitutional respon-
sibility to prevent the waging of
war without Congressional ap-
provalr

The nightmare of Vietnam has
been unique in our history. it is
the longest war in which we have
participated. It was waged far

from our shores and, for the
greatest part, irr spite of our
national conscience, For most

Americans it was a TV war, a
mammoth, Slll‘l‘t‘tlllsllC army
maneuver waged nightly on l.ll(‘
seven o'clock news. lixcopt for
‘thosu who fought, and their
families and friends, it was hit-
suiess as usual for the nation
And litlsitti-ss, as tlhllttl, was
good

Moreover, inst as it is rm
possible to find a
(‘illlSt‘ for Vietnam, it is difficult
to pinpoint a beginniirgirf lllt'
war and it wrll lll' t’tlllillly (lll'l'l'

her, no D-Day, and there will be
no famous memorials, like Iwo
Jima, or the Alamo, or battle-
ship museums to remind us
for most of all, we want to
forget. Unfortunately, forgetting
should be relatively easy-indeed,
far too easy.

When the generation of peace
we have been promised finally
comes, there will be little change
here at home to distinguish it
from the decade of war we will
have ended The problem with
that is that lessons are seldom
learned from mistakes which are
not accompanied by sacrifice.
And if Vietnam was a mistake of
the magnitude most Americans
seem to lwlicvu, it. was nonethe-
less not a mistake which
wrought great personal sacrifice
upon the majority of our cili-

Central Council Ponders Parking Strike:

Now What Do We Do?

by Glenn von Nostitz

“Where do we go from here?"

That's the question a lot of
people involved in student gov-
ernment here at SUNYA are
asking in the aftermath of the
recent parking strike.

Most council members feel
that another strike certainly is
warranted, since the administra-
tion has gone ahead with en-
forcement of the controversial
rules recently passed by the Uni-
versity Trustees — the rules that
precipitated the initial strike
action. Even since November
13th campus security has been
towing and ticketing vigorously.
Parking in the mtrin lots is still
segregated according to faculty-
strtdenl status. Parking is still
prohibited on tho quads. No
parking is allowed around the
podium except for vchic i-s Willi
medical pt‘rntils. And pcnpliI are
still being charged for towing.

But another strike is l‘ll'tll'ly alt
impossibility Strike loaders ilt‘l'

Helplessness

There are a lot of observers
who don't see the picture as all
that bleak. They claim the strike
was a success because security
was effectively prevented from
towing any cars. The campus
cops apparently did not want a
confrontation with students, so
they kept their shiny new tow
truck hidden safely in the ga-
rage.

Nonetheless, there seems to be
a deep-seated feeling among
some students that they are tru-
ly helpless in the face ofridmini-
strative tactics. The strike illus
trated how ear;in the administra-
tion can circumvent even the
most concerned efforts of stu-
dent activists.

Often cited by Central Council
leaders is at least one solid or»
i-trmplisltmt'nl of the strike of-
fort. This was lllt‘ series of mot-t-
ings which have Iii-on hold l)t‘-

tors, and which were aimed at
closing the “ctimnrirnications

Executive Committee of the
University which would act as a
"clearinghouse," but “not a rub-

would be subject only to the
veto of the University President.
