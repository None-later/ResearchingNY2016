"Lady

by Pam & Michael Rosentlial

Alternative Features Service

You may not be aware of it
(the word gets around slowly)
but blacks now comprise 40
percent of the American film-go-
ing audience.

Undoubtedly, the ramifica-
tions of this have only begun to
be felt, and already the effect
has been staggering. Super/Ly hus
outgrossed (financially) every
other ﬁlm for nearly a month,
and not one single production in
the recent black wave, from
Shaft on down to Blaculu, has
failed to yield a tidy profit.

There is nowhere near to pro-
portional representation of black
film critics. who are sorely nocd-
cd to sort out the whole busincss
from (in inside persi)cctch,so we
think that the first thing we
should remark about Ludy Sings
the Blues is that thc lzirgcly
bltiL‘k tiudiciitfc in :iltciidiinci-
when we stiw it lchtl cvcry
minute of it, chccring and his-
sing and talking hack to the
characters on screen the wziy
audiences used to in thc lcgcnd
my age of silent cinema.

Lady is littis'l‘d on Billii- lltill'
day’s autobiography, and for thc
first fifteen minutes or so sttiys
fairly faithful to its source,

One day, deciding that she has
had enough of the trade, Billie
leaves a customer in his long-

club that is udvertising for ii
dancer. Although she makes a
fool of herself as it (lancer, ii

and she opens that evening. Too

What’s lost is not so much a
result of the telescoping of time,
as ii real whitewash of emotional
quality. The role-reversal in this
scene conforms to the most con-
ventional of Hollywood's sexual
biases, while at the same time
sacrificing the strength, self-pos-
session and rugged integrity that
are present throughout Billic’s
book.

On screen, Billie is ii fluttery,
helpless, totally "feminine" crea-
