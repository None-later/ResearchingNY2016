  

c Davis: The Birth of the Cool it

by Arlene Scheurer

Now that Miles Davis has
achieved an amount of popu-
larity beyond that which Is
usually accorded jazz musicians,
it is more interesting than ever
to look at the various stages
through which he haS'passed in
order to get where he has. His
recently reissued album The
Complete Birth of the Cool
(Capitol M1 1026) allows one to
do exactly that. This album was
recorded about 22 years ago,
and it shows how much Davis
has changed. When this album
was first released it began what
has been called “cool jazz."
Therefore this is a very impor-
tant collection of recordings.
Tlte arrangements by Gil Evans
are like cumulus clouds. large
yet soft and billowy. Davis'
playing is relaxed (sortieiinies
too much so) and natural. llis
range is limited arid his soles are
sltort. Sales by Lee Koiiilx and
John Lewis add value to this
recording.

all artistic qualities. Holmes can
play with a lot of drive if. he
wishes, as is evident on “One
Mint Julep" and “Pure Sugar
Cane". But too much room is
given to such dead wood as “Go
Away Little Girl" and “It’s
Going To Take Sotne Time"
while Holmes is almost crowded
out by the heavy handed rhythm
team. On the other hand, not
enough space is given to trom-
bonist Garnett Brown and
Tenorist Selden Powell, both of
whom could have added quite a
bit to this album. Even so, this is
one of l'loInic's best albums in
the past few years and when he
is allowed to let loose his organ
playing is as good as nearly
anyone's in jazz.
