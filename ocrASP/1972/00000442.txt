News Briefs

LEWISTON, Maine AP —

Americans deny the inevitably
of death and consider it to be
similar to going to sleep in a
comfortable bed, a sociologist
says.
It is something to be ignored,
sent packing off to a nursing
home to slip away and die off-
stage, says Richard C. Dumont
of Bates College, who recently
coauthored a book, The/lined»
can View of Death: Acceptance
or Denial.

“The American apparently
does not die," he said.

Madison Avenue image makers
and businessmen seeking profit
have combined to project the
American corpse as alive as
possible, and going to sleep in a
casket which is often explicitly
advertised as a comfortable bed.

Dumont said he still personally
denies death “at the gut level.
Although I am more conscious
now of the ambivalence surroun-
ding death, it's no more compre-
hensible than it ever was."

He added that he personally
hasn't “solVed any better the
notion that 1'” die.

“It's good for the individual to
know that ambivalence of con
fusing feelings about death are
natural," Dumont said. “It's
helpful in view of individual
adaptation."

Dumont said his observations
indicate that Americans, di-
verted by an afﬂuent culture,
deny the inevitability of their
death.

And he credited the American
tendency to “run, hide and seek
refuge in group norms and
actuarial statistics...that blur the
individual face of death” with a
kind of national delusion of in-
vulnerability to it.

NEW YORK AP — The Daily
Express of London said Monday
that Martin Bormann, Adolf
Hitler's deputy in World War II,
is hiding on a vast Krupp estate
in Argentina, where he was
traced by the South American
country’s secret service.

The article, by spy expert
Ludislas Farago and former Ex-
press foreign editor Steward
Steven, wus distributed under
copyright in the United States
by the Chicago Tribune<New
York Daily News Syndicate and
appeared here in the Daily News.

The newspaper showed pic-
tures of a thick-set, balding man,
said to be Borman traveling
under the name Ricardo Bauer,
being interviewed by an Argen-
tine immigration inspector. It
siad Bormann was photographed
at checkpoint Mendoza in north-
ern Argentina th-n he crossed
over from Chile on Oct. 5.

SODOM, Israel AP — Centuries
before pornography and nude
movie scenes turned inning into
ho—hum family entertainment, ‘
this part of Israel was the._awing-
ingest-wicked city in the Worm.

Nowadays Sodom is dullsville.

From the dedicated sinner, the
closed thing to an illicit thrill is
picking up a lump of salt litter-
ing the empty landscape, bleaker
than Death Valley.

Sodom in 1972 is a nature
preserve, although just what the
Israeli government is trying to
preserve is difﬁcult to imagine.

There’s nothing here except
salt crystals, lying around like
snow, but a sign proclaim them
“protected natural emu" and
swiping them qualiﬁes as a sin,
or a least a crime.

In Old Testament days, Sodom
must have made Las Vegas seem
like a kindergarten. Along with
Gomorrah, which has vanished
from the face of the earth,
Sodom got top billing in the
Bible for unsavory repute. God
destroyed them both.

The scriptures don't make
clear exactly what was going on,
but Genesis says: “The men of
Sodom were wicked, great
sinners...Thc Lord mined on

Sodom and Gomorrah hrlmeto'nc
and ﬁre...nnd He curl-hm
those chi-wand lo, the smoke
of thy land went up like the
smoke of a furnace."

'ﬂlat's pretty much the way it
is even now, much to the dis-
appointment of tourists looking
for a little iniquity in the Holy
Land.

NEW YORK AP — The stars of
“Peepalive,” where for 25 cents
you can watch nearly nude
women on a revolving stage, take
their final bows today, according
to a spokesman for the real
estate man and attorney Edward
Finch.

Finch, uncle of President
Nixon's son-in-Iaw Edward
Finch Cox, was one of a number
of real estate holders identiﬁed
recently as landlords of building
housing sex shows and shops in
the Times square area.

The spokesman said Monday
that all such tenants will be
evicted from Finch properties by
next spring, either through lease
expiration; or legal action.

The first casualty is "Peep-
alivc." Other supposedly sala-
cious businesses operating out of
Finch buildings included several
bookstores and a male sex
cinema.

. A stators-anthem Fln’chuld
Illil corporation had not leased
the property to the tenants In
question and asserted it had
spent more than one year trying'
to flush them out.

In another development in the
city’s campaign to rid midtown
of pomography, a deputy com-
rnimioner in the Department of
Consumer Affairs said his agency
would soon start making weekly
reports of action taken against
alleged offenders.

DIJON, France AP — The first
electric-powered automobiles to
look like real cars instead of
beach buggies or props for circus
bears will go unglamorously into
service next year in Dijon.

Only the standard engine and
transmission have been replaced
in a series of 80 workaday
Renault R45 that Electricite de
France, the state-owned utility
monopoly, is modifying to serve
as repair and customer relations
cars.

It wants to push the idea that
autos that don‘t make smoke or
noise have grown out of the
futureland sections of amuse-
ment parks rind into something
solid enough that its repairman
can start driving in June.
