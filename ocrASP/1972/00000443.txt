" ask/eases: s agape

by Richard Yanku

A young, inexperienced junior
varsity basketball team at Al-
bany will be playing their first
game of the season at Hudson
Valley on Saturday, Dec. 2 at 2
p.m. Coach Lewis has tried to
smooth out the young Danes'
problems in the final three
weeks of the practice season, but
three words might sum up the
outcome of the first game: re-
bounding, inexperience and
Vikings.

The Great Dane “Pups” are
not big in size. To campersate for
their size, Coach Lewis has tried
to teach them how to box out
the bigger man, properly. In a
scrimmage against one foe,
Fulton-Montgomery the Danes
“held their own" according to
Coach Lewis, versus the big man.
While the biggest man on the
Albany JV‘s is about 6'2", the
tallest on Fulton was 6'7". The
results of the game turned out to
be pleasing to the team and
Coach Lewis as they got their
share of the rebounds, offcn~
sively and defensively.

Although most of the players
on the Albany squad have had
high school experience in basket-
ball, only one or two of the
players have had college basket»
ball experience. Ron ’l‘crry, from
Colonic, is the only JV not
having played varsity basketball
in high school. Jim Eisenman is
one of possibly two players with
college basketball experience.

In the past years, HVCC has
been big in size, they like to play
man to man defense, and they
like to utilize the press. Last

year, Hudson Valley played .500
ball, but most of the losses came
against teams much tougher and
out of their class. However, only
in two or three of those losses
did HVCC lose by 15 or 20
points.

The “Pups”, however, can

counteract their lack of experi»
ence and rebounding with quick-
ness and the ability to shoot well
from the outside. Jim Eisenman
possesses both of these talents.
He will, hopefully, be looked to
as quarterback or play-maker for
the JV's. “Candy” Lyons, al«
though just out of high school,
also possesses quickness and the
ability to take the outside shot.
He could give the fans of the
Albany JV's something to look
Forward to as the season moves
on. Jeff Boyer, from Lockport,
seems to have impressed (‘oach
Lewis on his rebounding ability
and Bill Warner's bood outside
shooting could present lmvns
some problems when he decides
to pick the starting five. Royce
Russell baffles this reporter and
Coach Lewis and his starting in
the game versus HVCC is nut-s-
tiunable. Royce definitely has
the potential to be starting for
ward, but he has the tendency to
Use his talents as a guard, and he
doesn't fit at the guard position

he tlloyce) does this swncliing
from guard to forward and back
so often in practices, he may l)l'
passed up by lA‘WIs as a starting
five player.

All in all, the JV team has to
do alot of straightening out, and
if they don't do it by tomorrow
--2 p.m.~~lludson Valley will
easily handle the “I’ups.” How-
ever, Coach LI-Wis has had the
small team blues as a basketball
coach before and has had his
share of Vt'lllllt‘l'> in small teams.

Hoopsters Open Saturday, Kpllpﬂurt

by Bill Heller

Injury and disease struck the
Great Dane Basketball team this
past week as they readied for a
tough Stony Brook opener
tomorrow night. Definitely out
of action are center-forward
Werner Kolln (mononucleosis)
and rookie RICh Kapner (hone
chip). Other assorted worries for
Doc Sauers are center Bob Cur-
tiss's ankle (hurt in the Mont-
clair scrimmage), Byron Miller's
sprained finger (shouldn‘t affect
him), and a bout with food

poisoning incurred by co»
captain John Quattrocchi and
Mike Hill. Both the latter two,
and hopefully Curtiss also.
should be 100% at gamctime,

If nothing else, Kolln's absence
will accentuate the key to a
successful debut, and in whole, a
successful year: control of the
boards. Besides losing his versa-
tility, the Danes will also miss
Werncr's fine brand of defense
and those all-important re-
bounds. 'l‘ziking his spot will be
Curtiss, a scasunL-d vet from last

year. Bob has a soft touch, but
lacks Kolln’s aggressiveness. Be—
hind him is Harry Johnson, who
continues to improve from last
year, and Mike Hill.

Sauers will go with Bob Rossi
and ’I‘rocli in the backcourt, and
Miller and cn-cziptain Reggie
Smith at the forwards. 6'2"
Dave WI-lchons can expect to see
action at both positions, but
primarily at his more familiar
guard spot. With either Curtiss
or Johnson in the pivoL, the
Danes, :it Tninimum, still have a

AND FOR THE PRICE 0
OF SCHAEFER BEERE, HE WAS

cohesive unit of seven players
back from last year. They are
experienced, quick, and all know
how to put the points on the
board. The question is can they
stop Stony Brook, no easy task?

Pacing the opposition is 6‘3"
forward Art King and his play-
mates on the front line: 6'6"
center Chris Ryba and 6'4" Bill
Grahms, both good rebounders.
King has credentials all his own
includi ig a nineteen point
average last year and the MVP of
the Schacfer Tournament. Their

"‘rds are big, but not particu-

larly fast.

Doc Saueis sums up his
feelings about the game, “If my
‘team performs as well as they
can, we‘ll win. They're bigger--
we‘re quicker. If we execute, we
win.“ The Danes have lost their
opener the last two years in a
row, but this one should be
different. Last year Albany beat
Stony Brook at home by seven.
Tomorrow. despite the absence
of Kath, the Great Danes should
kick off a great season with a
win in the neighborhood of
77-66.
