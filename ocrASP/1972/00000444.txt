Wrestling returns to the Al-
bany State gym this Saturday
when the grapplers from Albany
take on three other schools in
the annual quadrangle meet at 1
pm.

Albany which was 5-5-1 last
year finished second a year ago.
Defending champion Union and
third place finisher Dartmouth
College return along with new-
comer RPI.

This opens the season for the
Albany matmen. Last year the
team started out strong but lost
five men around mid-season and
ended up a dismal seventh in the
SUNY Championship. This
year’s team has already set an
improvement on that ﬁnish a
goal for this year.

This year’s team has already
received a blow. Top wrestler
Phil Minis was expected back
but he dropped out of school.
Cliff Wess, a returning letterman,
is under doctor’s care and is not
expected to see much action.
High school standout, Ed Bellas
was expected to go out and
didn't.

But Coach Garcia still feels
that this team should l)l‘ able to
better last year's record. He sites
the tremendous attitude and
fierce determination of the
team. This year, the matmen
may be in their best shape ever,
as Garcia has had four scrimmages
with other schools. He was
forced to schedule these scrim-
mages as the team is short
handed and could not scrimmage
itself.

This is a perenial problem at
Albany even though the talent is
present. It is a mystery to Garcia
and the atheletic department,
why every year there are not
enough wrestlers to give the
starters some competition. There
are still openings on the team to
those who are interested.

Leading this year’s team is
returnee Larry Mims. Last year
he had the best record in dual
meets on the team. Also re-
turning is three year captain Jeff
Albrecht who came off a broken
leg to have a seven and two
record.

Last year's most improved
wrestler. Doug Bauer, also re-
turns. After a year of experience
Doug should be one of the team
leaders.

The heavy weight division has
been usually a Weak one for the
Great Danes, but this year its
different. Albany has two top
contenders, Rudy Vido and
Frank Villanova. ltudy was iri-
jured last year and will have a
fight on his hands for the top
job.

Dick Moody at 126 and Tom
Hurn at I538 are the other re-
turning lettermen.

New men who will br- stepping
into the top positions are Will
Kntz at 1 l8, Ethan Grossman at
Ill-l, Jim Dickson id 177 and
Bob Ni-rtinger at ltll),

How far the Albany tr-am can
go will depend on how well
these mr-ii perform and how
many injuries thr- tr-arri suffers.
If they avoid llljul‘lt'h' they
should better last year's mark
but a few injuries ('ullltl spi-ll
disaster for the team.
