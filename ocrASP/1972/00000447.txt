Puerto Ricon Studies Show Progressive

continued from page one

What does the program look
like now?

Six courses are being taught
this semester in the Puerto Rican
studies program and nine more
are planned for the spring, ac-
cording to Perez. The courses are
taught by one full-time member
of the program, Perez, and two
part-time teachers. About 150
students are currently enrolled
in the courses.

What was your role in getting
the Puerto Rican studies pro-
gram going here?

The first meeting for develo-
ping a program was held inlate
1969, Perez said. The idea was
basically student initiated'I Perez
claimed he acted more as a
coordinator than an initiator. A
comprehensive paper outlining a
Puerto Rican studies program
was prepared by May, 1971.
This prospectus emphasized a
program at [he master's level,
but the emphasis was shifted
later to undergraduate studies.
Although there are Puerto Rican
students enrolled in graduate
courses at SUNYA there arc no
graduate courses in Puerto Rican
slurlii-s.

"Someone with a Pita in
humanities or the social scien-
ces." That someone should have
had some involvement or in-
terest in Puerto Rican studies in
the past, and "preferably,"

v though not necessarily, will be
Puerto Rican, Perez said.

He hopes that by the end of
January a person will be selec-
ted, though the job does not
begin until September. Whoever
is hired will also teach.

What will you do when a direc-
tor is hired?

Perez, once an EOP counselor
and now working to get his
Doctor of Education in coun-
seling and personnel services,
will probably leave the program
after next semester. He said of
his role in the program: “I’ve
just been ﬁlling a vacuum at this
point." The program, he said, is
“not my area of specialty."

What does the future hold for
Puerto Iticrrn studies at SUN YA?

Perez maintainer] great faith
that the program will be a de-
partment by the end of next
semester. “We're getting full
cooperation from the dean's
ol'l'icc" toward getting lull-time
people to fill the gap for next
year. Perez held that the lack of
full-time Puerto lticans cm~

ployed here--he is the only one«-
is a situation that must be im-
proved. New Paltz State College,
much smaller than SUNYA,
employs more full-time Puerto
Rican professionals, according to
Perez.
I‘Itt

Perez, who was friendly and
talked freely, suggested that
campus-wide reaction to the pro
gram has calmed down since its
fiery beginning. He’s right. Atti-
tudes of tolerance or indiff-
erence characterize the atmos-
phere here toward the program.

And this is a hopeful sign. it
wasn't too many years ago that
this university, supposedly re-
sponsive to all the people of this
state, was almost 100 percent
white. Then came the first
shock, the growth of the Educa-
tional Opportunity Program and
the consequent growth of the
Afro-American studies depart—
ment. The second shock was
Puerto Rican studies.

The third shock, or tremor,
came about the same time as
Puerto Rican studies: it was and
still is called the Affirmative
Action Program. This program
was drawn up in response to a
study by the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare,

which documented what every-

one already knew, that minority
groups and women, too, were
not employed in signiﬁcant
numbers here. 16 fact, for a long
time a. black face was a rare sight
in both the classroom and the
administration building.

These steps represent signiﬁ-
cant progress towards ending dis-
crimination in education here.
The fact that it took so long to
take these measures tarnishes the
university image, held by some,
of always being well in the fore-
front of social progress. But,
hopefully, the progress that has
been the result of so many peo~
ple bashing their heads against a
slow yielding bureaucracy, will
be maintained by that same
bureaucracy. For now that these
programs are moving forward
within the SUNYA institution, it
would probably be as hard or
harder to remove them as it was
to get them in.
