As we approach the end of
another semester, many of us
tend to reflect on the accom-
plishments and/or failures of the
past few months. For some this
past term has been a time of new
understandings, new insights,
and good times; for others it has
been a depressing and agonizing
ordeal.

There is always something that
transcends our own personal
anguish or our personal hap-
pincss. Often we tend to forget
that outside the three mile pi-r-
imeter road that encloses us in
this intellectual resort a real
world with real problems ('Xists

world where people actually do

see leaders chosen in smoke

which had been hastions of an
elite political philosophy were
suddenly caught tip in the fires

The villa used for the after-
noon session is set deep in a vast
stretch of parkland behind high
walls and closed, guarded, iron

The Whitc House said Kissinger

Administration sources in

senior officials to prepare for a
