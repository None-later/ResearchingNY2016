Albany’s depth and Byron Mil-
ler’s hot hand were the'key
factors in the Great Danes 66-51
opening win over tough Stony
Brook Friday night. Miller hit
ten for fifteen and his twenty
points were good for game
honors. The depth came in the
form of Harry Johnson, who got
to play early and often with
Werner Kollin out. Harry took a
while to warm up, but scored
ten of his tweIVe points in the
second half, when the Danes
blew the game open.

With Bob Rossi and Reggie
Smith ice cold, and John Qua-
trocchi not shooting (two for
five in the whole game), Doc
Sauers needed the offensive
punch from somewhere. He
found it in Miller and Johnson,
the latter seeming to improve
every time he plays.

Starting quickly, the Danes
raced to ii 6-0 lead, broke a
12-12 tie with an 8-1 spurt, and
were never headed after that.
Reggie Smith held flashy Art
King to five in the first half, as
Stony Brook fell behind 32-24.
After that, the best Stony Brook
could do was put on it helluva
halftime show with the Smitb~
town IndianettL—s, a group of
twenty-five precision kicking
lovelies who did their thing to
rock music. Outscoring the Indi-
ans Iii-3 to start the second hiilf,
Albany never led by less than
ten for the final twelve minutes.

The Great Danes did look a
little shabby in the opening min-
utes, but they then settled down
to play in
especially

disciplined dc fcnsc,

cutting off Stony

 

Brook’s shufﬂe play, one de-
signed to give the talented King
his favorite short jumper. King
ﬁnished with just sixteen, the

_ only Indian in double figures.

Three things prevented the
Danes from winning really big.
To begin with, the three Albany
guards, Rossi, Troch, and
Welchons, produced a meager
fourteen points, two in the sec-
ond half. Afterwards, Troch ex-
plained that his job for this game
was simply to bring the hall

pass 0 f. This c did,
getting five assists, although he
also turned the ball over a few
times. As for Rossi, it was just a
bad night, that's all. Bob
summed up his game in the
lockerroom, “I'm ready for Uti-
ca." Dave Welchons played an
effective steady game, iind a
typical one for him: good play»
making, great defense, and one
field goal attempt.

The second Alliany problem
was fouls, Although they shot a
perfect Ill-It) from the line, the
Danes committed twenty-one
personals, four each by Curtiss,
Johnson, and Miller. Fortunate-
ly, the Indians shot a horrendous
thirteen for twenty-four at the
charity stripe, and didn't lake
advantage of the whole situation
even when Sauers was forch to
rotate his players to keep them
for the closing minutes.

Finally, that old problem, re-
bounding, creeped up at times.
Kolln was missed here, but cer-
tainly not in crucial terms. Harry
Johnson pulled down seven
bounds, high for the Danes, but
there were sequences when
Stony Brook got three or four
shots at a time. The reason was
congestion. When the lane gets
crowded, that height disad-
vantage (something Doc Sauers
is very familiar. with) really
hurts. Individually, Harry and
Byron stole the show. Harry
does “just what Doc tells me to”
and if he keeps it up, he might
earn a starting nod over Bob
Curtiss, who shot well but was
not aggressive on the boards.
Byron demonstrated his offen-
sive potential, combined it with
a tight “D,” and overall played
an excellent. game. Also, Reggie
Smith did twelve and
stopped King in the first half,
but he is capable of much more,

The Great Danes hadn't won
their opener in two years. This
was undoubtedly their best first
game in years, as at times they
showed the ability to blow
Stony Brook off the court. As
the season progresses, expect to

HVCC Spoils Pups Opener

by Richard Yanku

A twenty point lead opened up
by the host, Hudson Valley,
early in the second half proved
fatal to a late Albany State JV
Basketball team rally as the
Dane Pups lost their season
opener 7 1 -li 1.

Herb Kennedy put on a (HIP
man show for IIVtIC in the first
half, scoring III of his gunn-
total 27 points as the Vikings
took a illi~$l| Il’il(l at llllt‘t‘
mission. IIoWi-vvr, the I’ups had
trailed by as much as lliirlccn

helping the Danes outscim- the

hosts, iii-10 in the last five
minutes of the first half.

The young Danes kept close at
the onset of the second half, and
even pulled to within three
points, 5047. But, Harvey
Dorsey of HVCC hit two con-
secutive field goals and John
(Tolox'ra scored six straight
points as the Vikings ran the
score to 59—39 mid-way through
the second half.

At this point Jim Eisenmaii,
the man who Ilic Albany JV's

Last Event Win. Lifts Aqua‘men to Victory.  

by Nathan Salant

The Albany swimming team
opened their season on a very
positive note this past Saturday,
as the Great Danes came from
behind to 'surprise Plattsburgh,
58-54. The meet came down to
the last event, with Albany trail.
ing 54-51, and Plattsburgh heavi-
ly favored to take the 400 yard
free-style relay, but the Danes
pulled it out - thanks to the
heroics of Ken Weber and Jaik
Schubert.

The meet opened with Albany
winning the 400 yard medley
relay, as Hart, Purctz, Gersten-
haber, and Van Ryn combined
to give the Danes an early lead.
The lead did not last, as Platts-
burgh took the next 4 events the
1000, 200, and 50 yard free»
styles, and the 200 yard indi-
vidual medley. However, Albany
took what later proved to be
several ‘ key runner-up spots,
picking up 3 points per event for
second place finishes in all four
events, and one point for third
place in the latter two.

Next, Albany closed the gap,

thanks to some fancy diving by
the highly regarded newcomer
Bob Canter, who broke the varsi-
ty record with 146.90 points in
the 1 meter required diving
event, and a Gerstenhaber vic-
tory in the 200 yard butterfly
with Schubert placing third.

The next few events saw the
lead see-saw back and forth.
Plattsburgh moved ahead via a
win in the 100 yard freestyle,
with Albany's Staples placing
third for one point. Albany
gained ground minutes later,
when Hart broke all previous
SUNYA records with a 22141.6
mark in the 200 yard back-
stroke, and Eson placed third.
The Danes continqu to battle
back, as Van Ryn won the 500
yard freestyle, and Weber
grabbed the number three spot.
The streak of wins ended at two
when Plattsbiirgh took the 200
yard breaststroke, but the Danes
took third thanks to l’uretr.
Canter got things going again by
taking the l meter optional (IlVl‘
Willi a 159.90, and it all came
down to the thirteenth and final

Dartmouth With 61 pts For
Union it was the fourth straight

tournament,
The new star for Albain is Will
Katz at 118 lbs. Katz, a wrest-

 

event, the 400 yard free relay,
with the Danes trailing by three.

The pressure was on, and
Staples, Weber, Schubert, and
Eson all knew it. They also knew
that Plattsburgh was a heavy
favorite in this event, and that
this would decide everything.
Albany was at a supposed dis-

advantage because both Weber
and (Schubert are long distance
men, and not sprinters. The race
opened with Staples, our num-
ber one man, swimming even
with his match, and the race
passed into the hands of Ken
Weber. Weber came from no

place to open up a Dane lead.

  

and Schubert followed by bust-
ing the race wide open. Eson
could have floated in, but chose
to go for the record, which was
broken via a 3:39.6 mark.

Coach Kelly was ecstatic over
the win, and both he and the
team were, “just astounded
when we won the relay, and
Plattsburgh was shocked because
they expected to win this race.

It took us about half an hour to;

get back to earth. It was a very
pleasing and exciting come-
‘Irom-behind victory." — To say
the least!

The Coach was even more en-
couraged by the relatively large
number of varsity records which
were broken in this, the first
meet. Since times improve stead-
fly, and with 4 records broken
and one tied in the opener,
Coacn Kelly can rightfully ex-
pect a winning year, and if the
tamcan continue at this rate, all
of its pre-seas'on goals will be
more than satisfied.
