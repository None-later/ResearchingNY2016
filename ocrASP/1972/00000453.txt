(CPS) — Students in the
Buffalo, Boston, and New York
City areas who had taken the
Law School Admission Test
(LSAT) preparatory c0urse, have
reported that practice questions
given in the course appeared in
part or verbatim on the July 29
and October 21 LSAT exams.

The students had all attended
the Stanley H. Kaplan Educa-
tional Center Ltd. LSAT pre-
paration course; an independent
educational service headquar-
tered in Brooklyn, New York,
with nine other centers across
the country.

The LSAT exam was explained
by Anthony Glocklar, LSAT
program director, as being de-
signed “to test the skills and
abilities required of a good law
student." The test is admini-
stered by the Educational Test-
ing Service, which disavows any
connection with courses or
books designed to improve test
scores.

Students who took the July 29
and October 21 exams reported
that reading passages, graphs and
parts of the Cases and Principles
section of the LSAT were dis-
tributed in class in the Kaplan
course.

People who took the course
were reported by one student as
“laughing through the test."
having been familiar with “50%
of the material.“ Other students

Gross Goes Big Time

Hollywood, Florida — A recent
outbreak of murders in the drug
underworld has vividly support~
ed police claims that the nation's
marijuana trade is fast falling
into the hands of hoodlums.

Marijuana is now a multi-
billion dollar business, involving
more money than all but the
largest industrial combines, and
it is only natural that so much
tax-free cash attracts organized
crime.

The large scale marijuana deal-
er in the past was generally a
college or graduate student with
no criminal background. These
amateurs made money supplying
their local campuses with a few
kilos of the illegal weed smug-

gled in from South-of-the-
Border.
But with the explosion of

marijuana use the small time
smuggler is being forced out of
the market by giant criminal
organizations. Not only do these
new breed of smugglers have vast
sums of money to invest, but
many of the principals involved,
like prohibition barons of old,
think nothing of shooting down
rival dealers.

"With so much money in-
volved in pot," said a U.S. Cus-
toms official, "there are bound
to be casualties."

South Florida, where a large
proportion of the nation's grass

previously enrolled in the course

could not attest to the 50%

figure, but contended that there
was some duplication.

Students who took the course
are being asked to sign afﬁdavits
about the similarities between
questions on the actual test,and
on practice tests given in class.

If sufﬁcient evidence can be
obtained, the ETS would be able
to obtain a temporary injunction
against Kaplan and therefore be
allowed to use discovery pro-
ceedings to subpoena Kaplan's
course materials and make an
informed decision as to whether
test materials have been dupli~
cated.

One affidavit states a conver-
sation was overheard before the
July 20 LSAT between a student
enrolled in the Kaplan course
and an instructor at the Center,
during which the instructor “in-
formed him (the student) that if
he could remember any ques-
tions on the LSAT and report
back to Kaplan, he would be
reimbursed." The affadavit con-
tinues that the student said, “I
think he mentioned $5.“

Another affidavit reuttcsts to
the similarities between the
course material and the test. and
their effect on the student‘s
success with the test. The stu-
dent's affidavit states,“Sceing
the two paragraphs bcforc . . .
madc it a whole lot easier. The
graph was the hardest oirc on the

test. seeing it before rcally

supply enters the country, has
seen some "pretty tough cus'
tomers" take over the business,
according to an area police
spokesman. Broward County
(Fort Lauderdalel Sheriff Ed
Stack, whose jurisdiction covers
acres of swamp land favored by
smugglers for airplane drops, said
that his deputies have noted an
upswing in the number of shot-
guns, carbines, machineguns and
large caliber revolvers taken
from drug distribution suspects.

In early fall, Stack said, his
deputies raided a house near the
edge of the Everglades where
they faund more than 1,000
pounds of freshly cut marijuana
recently smuggled into the area
and bound for the Deep South
and Midwest. As they attempted
to rush the front door, the
Sheriff said, a slight, 25-year-old
girl from South Carolina opened
up on them with a .30 caliber
carbine.

“Much to our distress," Sher-
iff Stack said, "we have found
grass pushers inevitably armed to
the teeth with weapons we iden»
tify with organized crime."

A major portion of the mari-
juana traffic in the Eastern half
of the United States is now
attributed to a group of felons
with loose connections to orga-
nized crime. The Dixie Mafia, as
police call them, smuggle grass
through South Florida and dis-
tribute it as far north as New

helped."

Students have reported that
the sections of the LSAT they
found duplicated in the Kaplan
course were distributed only in
class and collected before each
section was over. The disputed
passages did not appear in the
take-home problems, according
to many students who took the
course.

When asked about the matter,
Kaplan denied ever having seen
an actual copy of the LSAT.
“People have offered to bring
me back a copy of the exam. i
told them to disappear the other
way.“

Stating he didn't use the same
questions as the LSAT, Kaplan
continued, “What happens is
that so many people see a topic,
like if I have something on
Shakespeare and the LSAT has
something on Shakespeare, right
away (people think its) the same
paragraph, the same exam, when
it really isn‘t."

Kaplan said liTS has never
complained to him. “I don't see
any reason wiry they should."|1c
explained. “If they have given a
topic that appears again and
again. it simply means that the
ETS. the LSAT. has given the
same topic again. There is no
reason why they can't change
the topics each time.

iic said students come back

York City.

Miami police contend the
group's marijuana activities were
responsible for the recent execu-
tion-style murder of a former
organization member, ex-convict
Jackson Smith. Two teenage
companions who happened to be
accompanying Smith and who
were the daughters of a political-
ly prominent Louisiana family
were also slain.

Miami Police Department
horridde Sgt. Mike Gonzalez re-
ported that the shootings were
done by "professional mob hit
man" underscoring the ominous
new trends in the marijuana
racket.

The Violence connected with
the mob takeover of the marijua»
na business is not peculiar to
South Florida. A few weeks ago
another alleged member of the
Dixie Mafia, Charles Christian,
surrendered to police in Savrin-
nah, Ga., becuuso he claimed he
was marked for death by gang-
land exucutionors.

A mustachiood young man
identified with the marijuana
trade in New York City was
f0und decapitated in Brooklyn.
His murder was tied in with
territorial disputes among the
grass dealers of the city only
ifter his head was found in a
garbage pail near Fifth Avenue.

In Detroit and Chicago police
have seen a surge in violence

after a test and tell him topics
that were on the test. Then his
research team prepares a para-
graph on the same topic. “This
isn’t just us. People all over the
place are remembering the ques-
tions that appear again and
again. There is nothing wrong
with going over topics of past
tests.“

Glocklar explained that about
"one-eighth of the questiohs" on
the LSAT are new items being
tested for use on future exams.
The rest of the questions have
been used on previous exams
either as experimental items or
as actual test questions. “Ques-
tions are reviewed periodically"
stated Glocklar. “Those no
longer deemed relevant are re-
tired and copies of old tests are
destroyed."

William llrill. chairman of the
Legal Affairs Committee of the
Law School Admissions Council,
the organization representing
schools who use the LSAT for
admissions, reacted to tire dis-
covery of similarities between
the course and the LSAT by
saying "This is apparently the
first instance that there have
been actual lllillL'llillS given in
cram courses that l have know-
ledge of. We'll have to investi~
gate this wrtlnn our own
mechanism. We Will bring some
legal actions if they have actual

materials. Our basic concern is
for the integrity of the admis-
sions process.“

Some students who took the
Kaplan course have urged that
information regarding the dupli-
cation ofquestions on the LSAT
not be made public for fear of
damaging their chances of ad-
mission to law school.

John Leach, chairman of the
Committee of Character and
Fitness of the Bar Association
for the 8th Judicial district in
New York, was quick to reassure
thcm. “We are certainly not
going to disqualify the LSAT
score ofa person who talks to us
and let everyone else go. We will
not notify the law schools. We're
not going to penalize somconc
who comes forward with facts in
this matter, We don‘t consider
these people as having done
anything wrong."

But, Leach continued, “We
need a foundation to go into
coirrt and say we have reason to
believe that Kaplan is using test
material improperly."

Both the New York State At-
torney General and the Con»
sinner Frauds Bureau of New
Yotk have expressed interest in
the controversy, but IiTS has
expressed hopes that these routes
would not be rieccssary,rrnd that
the investigation could be dorrc‘
‘coopcratively" between stu-
dents and the testing service.

Capitol Correspondent

A state legislative commission
has taken a long, hard look at
campus construction throughout
the State University system and
issued a report giving the State
University Construction Fund
(SUCF) what might best be des-
cribed as mixed ratings.

The construction fund oversees
virtually all SUNY construction.

While landing the fund for

successfully providing SUNY
with the necessary academic
space in a period of intense
growth, the lengthy report, a
product of the State Legislative
Commission on Expenditure
Review, levels a number of criti-
cisms at the construction
agency.

Among the ﬁndings of the
report:

---96% of the projects surveyed
were completed behind sche-
dule.

---Finai costs of the projects

   

exceeded original budget re-
quests in over 60% of the cases.
 widespread structural deﬁ-
ciencies exist in many newly-
constructed buildings.

---The Construction Fund has
been “generous” in its payments
to architects, many of whom are
responsible for the structural
problems.

---Aesthetics have often been
placed above practical considera-
tions when planning architec-
tural design, often to the detri—
ment of students and facultv.

— Albany Campus Deemed

"Functional"

Acoustical Problems Revealed

The reporl. of the Legislative
Commission on Expenditure
Review seemed to contradict the
Popular notion that Albany
State is a non-functional, un-
comfortable architectural di-
caster.

Generally, the report con»
ciuded that most students and
faculty interviewed were autis—
fied with the design of the physi-
cal campus and the classrooms-—
or at least as satisfied as their
peers on other SUNY campuses.

Major acoustical shortcomings
were uncovered, however, and
pollution and ventilation pro—
blems on the SUNYA campus
also received some attention in
the lengthy report.

To better acoustics, structural
repairs had to be made on 19
large classrooms, 60 medium size
classrooms and 13 seminar
room here at a cost of
$107,000. The report noted that
in many cases, the cost of
making such repairs was borne
by the operating budget of the
individual campus involved,
rather than by the architect,
SUCF, or SUNY. But it men-
tioned no specifics in the Albany
case.

Not supriaingly, hull" of the
students questioned in the atti-
tudinal section of the report.
gave the acoustics on the
SUNYA campus a poor rating.
Close to 70% of the participating
faculty agreed with the student
assessment.

There were a number of other

Psychology Professor

surveys that bore surprises for
those who have had daily con-
tact with Edward Durell Stone's
White Wonder.

64% of the students polled
gave the physical design of the
campus an “afﬁrmative” rating.
New Paltz, in comparison scored

81% and Binghamton scored
lowest with 68%.
Anonymous student com-

ments were printed in the report
and they ran the gamut from
deep satisfaction to feelings of
frustration and annoyance.

“I have attended a total of
four different colleges in this
state and others," one student
observed. “1 would have to say
that this is the best campus
physically that. l have ever been
to. Mr. Stone's planning and
architecture are both functional
and beautiful, something rare on
college campuses today.”

But another student com-
plained that. "everything has
been planned, there is no room
left for randomness...This cam-
pus looks like a world's fair or a
gigantic radiator."

Some students found the Alv

bariy campus “organized,”
“majestic” or "intriguing" while
others labeled architect Stone's
work “artificial” "cold" and
“impersonal.”

One student complained that
they aymmetryed beauty and
relaxation rather then enhanced
them. “We need more trees,
more plants, more green every-
where. It is much too stark
around here. Concrete doesn‘t
make it!“

But the report noted that
favorable comments outpolled
unfavorable ones by better than
a six to one margin.

On other topics, eight out of
every ten students queried found
the Albany campus "functional"
but faculty members rated it
appreciable lower in this area.

The vast majority of both
groups found the campus “or-
derly." And not suprisingly, 93%
labelled it “distinctive,” the
highest rating of the four schools
surveyed.

But Albany scored the lowest
in the area of comfort, pulling
well below the composite aver-
age.

ommission Faults SUNY Construction

In addition, auditors and
SUNY ofﬁcials were at odds in
their appraisals of the multi-
million dollar campus complex
at suburban Amherst. Investi-
gators ' ’ " of
ably high costs in planning and
design and laid the blame for
financial problems on the vacil-
lating and ambigious attitudes of
administrative officials. SUNY
Construction Fund officials
differed in their analysis of the
Amherst project and disputed
the ﬁndings of the report.

Construction Delays

The auditors said that Constru-
ction Fund goals should be those
associated with any public
construction program: “High
quality facilities" completed in a
“timely manner" at “reasonable
cost." It. gave the construction
fund differing marks in achieving
each of the three criteria.

The report praised SUCF for
successfully constructing some
11,200 projects valued at over
two billion dollars in the rela-
tively short span of ten years.
Construction thus kept pace
with the rapid increase in SUNY
enrollment.

But praise was tempered with
the admonition that 47 of the
49 projects studied were
completed behind schedule.
More than a third of the projects
were two years late.

Delays were evident in all
phases of construction work, but
especially so in the planning and

design stage. The blame for
project delays was shared by a
variety of people and agencies:
SUNY, for changing the func
tion or size of the building or

" ,. ' a design plans; the
Construction Fund, for estima-
ting project costa that were
above budget allotments; and
the architects, for a generally
“poor performance."

Disphtes between contractors
and architects further slowed
construction work, the report
said, and illustrated the weak-
nesses of the Construction Fund
in maintaining full control over
the individual construction
projects.

The auditors chided SUCF for
the agencies’ loose controls and
they called the agency to exert
greater influence over individual
projects.

The Stony Brook Student
Union and the Fredonia Fine
Arts building were cited as the
most serious cases where archi-
tectural and contractual disputes
added to normal project delays.
The report noted that at
Fredonia the contractor dia-
puted “every decision the archi-
tect made."

Cost Overruns

The legislative report was also
critical of the Construction
Fund for allowing actual costs to
substantially differ from original
budget estimates. Thirty of the
forty-nine projects surveyed ex-
ceeded initial budget requests,
