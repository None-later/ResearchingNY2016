(ZNS) Pennsylvania state senator Henry Cianfrani, a strong public
foe of abortions, is in deep political trouble.

Senator Cianfrani's troubles began last Week when the Philadelth
Inquirer revealed that the Senator had secretly paid for an “1,1,1
friend of his to have an abortion two years ago. The story surfaced
just a few days after Senator Cianfrani voted in favor of a bill whim
will greatly toughen laws against abortion in Pennsylvania

The Inquirer has produced a sworn statement from tho sommm

Boyer Discuss

by Glenn van Nostitz

State University Chancellor
Ernest L. Boyer told a Wednes-
day afternoon press conference
that he is withholding recog-
nition of SASU, the State Uni-
versity Student Association, be-
cause he is unsure if it is “repres-
entative of all the students."
Boyer said that he would not
support any university-wide
organization unless he was sure
it was “entirely legitimate."

The Chancellor feels that the
fundamental issue in the SASU
recognition struggle is the “na-
ture of representative govern-
ment."

He refused to say whether he
would endorse the recognition
drive being held under SASU
chief Mark Borenstein. The drive
aims at obtaining the signatures
of at least 50% of the students
on each campus on petitions
endorsing SASU as their state
wide representative. Boronstein
feels that the recognition prob-
lem lies with SUNY Central Ad-
ministration, but Boyer says the
problem is in “the nature of
SASU, itself."

Boyer appeared somewhat
tired and softspoken throughout
the hour long press conference,
which dealt mostly with reports
on the three-year time shortened
degree program and a study rc-
ccntly released on univr-rsity
graduate programs.

llt‘ said that the time-
shortcncd baccalaureate program
has been greatly expanded over
the past two years and that it
now t-nrolls some 700 students
on fch campuses. This figure is
expected to rise to over 2,000
students by autumn 1973 when
the program expands to t-Ven

   
   
 

The Chancellor explained
some of the different approaches
being tried in an effort to shor-
ten the college career. He cited
SUNY Albany’s James E. Allen
Collegiate Center which com-
bines the last year of high school
with the first two years of col-
lege, resulting in what he terms a
“3-2-2” arrangement, meaning
three years of high school, two
years at the Allen Center, and
two years in an upper division
program

Schools such as SUC Buffalo
and Geneseo presently are or
soon will be offering programs
which simply cut out one year
of college, and are open to any
interested and qualified fresh-
man.

Emphasizing the experimental
nature of the time-shortened
programs, the Chancellor said
that the University firmly Int~
licves “that experimentation, as
constrastcd to blind embrace, is
extremely important, For this
reason each of the University's
time shortened degree models
will take a slightly different
approach to shortening the trai-
ditionul academic program."

He added that the aim of
time-shortened programs is to
“increase flexibility" by offering
a student the option of com-
pleting his college education in
less time, if he is so inclined. A
student may also choose to add
a year to college, increasing the
high-school-college sequence
from eight to nine years Asks
Boyer: “Who said we always
have to stick with four years?"

Graduate Evaluations

In other matters the SUNY
Chancellor announced :in aca»
demic audit program to strong-
thcn graduate study throughout,

the University system. Guide
lines drawn up by Central SUNY
call for periodic five-year evalua-
tions of all existing and new
graduate programs. The evalua-
tions will focus on such criteria
as faculty strengths, the quality
of instruction and research, and
aniticipated employment oppor-
tunities.

Under the new guidelines each
campus will establish detailed
procedures for conducting pro-
gram rcviews and reporting re-
sults. The first step calls for an
internal evaluation done by the
faculty group involved in the
particular graduate program
This will be followed by an
outside highly qualified panel of
specialists who will visit the cam-
pus and make its own evaluation
of the program.

Written and oral reports and
recommendations then will be
presented to the graduate dean
of the campus, who will submit
them to the Graduate Council
and faculty members of the pro-
gram. All of the reports will then
be submitted to Central SUNY’s
provost for graduate education.
Comments Boyer: “The painful
process of evaluation has just
begun."

Journal lluilding

In other questioning, tllt'
Chancellor said that negotiations
with the owners of Albany's
Journal Building are proceeding
smoothly and that acquisition of
the property is absolutely neces-
sary if SUNY plans for consoli»
datinn of office is to succeed.
The University has already made
arrangements to purchastI the
adjoining, partially abandoned
Delaware and Hudson building.
which it will ri-novali- llltiltll' and
out.
