(ZNS) Pennsylvania state senator Henry Cianfrani. a strong public
foe of abortions, is in deep political trouble.

Senator Cianfrani's troubles began last week when the phllmelphia
Inquirer revealed that the Senator had secretly paid for an ex-giyl
friend of his to have an abortion two years ago. The story surfaced
just a few days after Senator Cianfrani voted in favor of a bill which
will greatly toughen laws against abortion in Pennsylvania.

The Inquirer has produced a sworn statement from the Senators
ex-girl friend, 'Oommlmie WOW“ Patricia Arney. who slates thatihn

State University Chancellor
Ernest L. Boyer told a Wednes-
day afternoon press conference
that he is withholding recog-
nition of SASU, the State Uni-
versity Student Association, be-
cause he is unsure if it is "repres-
entative of all the students."
Boyer said that he would not
support any university-wide
organization unless he was sure
it was “entirely legitimate.”

The Chancallor feels that the
fundamental issue in the SASU
recognition struggle is the “na-
ture of representative govern-
ment.“

He refused to say whether he
would endorse the recognition
drive being held under SASU
chief Mark Borenstein. The drive
aims at obtaining the signatures
of at least 50% of the students
on each campus on petitions
endorsing SASU as their state-
wide representative, Borenstein
feels that the recognition prob-
lem lies with SUNY Central Ad-
ministration. but Boyer says the
problem is in “the nature of
SASU, itself."

Boyer appeared somewhat
tired and softspokcn throughout
the hour long press conference,
which dealt mostly with reports
on the three-year time shortened
degree program and ii study re-
cently released on university
graduate programs.

He saii' that the tinie-
shortencd baccalaureate program
has been greatly expanded over
the past. two years and that it
now enrolls some 700 students
on fch campuses. This figure is
cxpcctcd to rise to over 2,000
students by autumn [9713 when
the program expands to evvn
more schools.

The Chancellor explained
t101m! of the different approaches
being tried in an effort to shor-
ten the college career. He cited
SUNY Albany’s James E. Allen
Collegiate Center which com-
bines the last year of high school
with the first two years of col-
lege, resulting in what he terms ii
"3-2-2" arrangement, meaning
three years of high school, two
years at the Allen Center, and
two years in an upper division
program

Schools such as SUC Buffalo
and Geneseo presently are or
soon will be offering programs
which simply cut out one year
of college. and are open to any
interested and qualified fresh-
man.

Emphasizing the experimental
nature of the time-shortened
programs, the Chancellor said
that the UniVi-rsity firme he-
[loves “that experimentation, as
constrastcd to blind embrace, s
extremely important. For this
reason each of the University's
time shortened degree models
will take a slightly different
approach to shortening the tra»
ditioniil academic program."

'10 adle that the aim of
time‘shortencd programs is to

.ncrcase flexibility" by offering
ii studan the option of com-
plctiiig his college education in
less time. if he is so inclined. A
student may also choose to add
a year to college, increasing the
high-schooI-college sequence
from eight to nine years. Asks
Boyer: “Who said we always
IHIVl‘ to stick with four years?"
Graduate Evaluations

In other matters the SUNY
Chancellor announced an aca-
(Icniic niiilil program to strong-
till'n graduate study throughout

Boyer Discusses SASU,, ‘3 -. Year

the UniVersity system. Guide-
lines drawn up by Central SUNY
call for periodic five-year evalua-
tions of all existing and new
graduate programs. The evalua-
tions will focus on such criteria
as faculty strengths. the quality
of instruction and research, and
aniticipated employment oppor-
tunities.

Under the new guidelines each
campus will establish detailed
procedures for conducting pro-
gram reviews and reporting re
sults. The first step calls for an
internal evaluation done by the
faculty group involved in the
particular graduate program
This will be followed by an
outside highly qualified panel of
specialists who will visit the cam-
pus and make its own evaluation
of the program.

Written and oral reports and
recommendations then will be
presented to the graduate dean
of the campus, who will submit
Him“ to the Graduate Council
and faculty mcmbcrs of the pro-
gram. All of the reports will then
be submitted to Central SUNY's
provost for graduate education.
Comments Boyer: “'i‘lii- painful
process of evaluation has just
begun."

Journal Building

In other qucstioiiing, the
Chancellor l'lid that negotiations
with the owners of Albany's
Journal Building are proceeding
smoothly and that acquisition of
the property is absolutely neces-
sary if SUNY plans for consoli-
dation of offices is to succeed.
The University has already made
arrangements to purchase the
adjoining. partially abandoned
Delaware and Hudson building.
which it will renovati- inside and
