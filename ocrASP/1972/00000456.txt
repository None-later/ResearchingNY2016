Pass-Fail
Satisfactory

To the Editor:

As a spectator at last Monday's
University Senate meeting, I
must voice my disappointment
in that body's refusal to recan-
sidcr the so-called “Bill 36." The
predominant feeling, one which
I heard several times during the
rather short discussion, was
“let‘s pass something now and
get this issue off the floor."

Bill 36 called for the elimin-
ation of S-U grading for fresh-
men and sophomores, except in
courses which departments
designate as being graded solely
on an S-U basis (which I may
point out are uncommon within
the academic course offerings).
The Ellinwood amendment
which the Senate tacked on
allowed up to 30 credits of S-U
during a student's stay at
SUNYA. While the debate on
Bill 36 was going on, the Senate
delayed a vote until a poll of the
students could be taken. The
students voted against Bill 36 bv
i 3—2 margin, whereupon the
Senate totally ignored this and
passed the Bill. with the
Ellinwood amendment added.

Why was there this rush to
dump S-U? First, there was the
claim by some faculty members
that the majority of students
preferred mandatory letter
grades. The poll of the students
disproved that. The poll was
then ignored, with the feeling

" Bloodbath "

“We will never allow the imposi-
tion of [he [7 million people of

Richard Nixon, July 27, [972

For four years, President
Nixon has used the threat of a
"communisl bloodbatb“ to jus~
tify prolonging the war in Viet-
nam. Again on October 26,
Presidential adviser Henry
Kissniger alluded to "possible
massacres" after a cease fire as
one of the reasons why the U.S.
would not sign the peace agree-

 

Letters to the Editor

 

 

presumably being that if the
faculty didn't like S-U, they
were going to dump it, whether
or not. the students liked it.

I am currently a freshman and
taking S~U grading. I came to
Albany in some measure because
I thought an S-U option, at. least
during the first two year,
showed an admirable sort of
ﬂexibility about an institution.
It showed that. they had some
faith in the good judgment of
the students who that. institution

admitted, and that they realized
courses aren‘t graded uniformly.
Three months after I arrive at
the school, the S-U option is
considerably cut back.

Among our three other Univer-
sity Centers, two have a total
S-U option. Both Stonybrook
and Binghamton allow a student
to choose, an a course-by-course
basis, whether he wants S-U or
letter gradesi A student could
theoretically take every course
on an S-U basis, but this is rarely
done because of the pressure of
grad schools, employment possi
bilities, and sometimes a genuine
liking for grades. This way, the
half of the student body who go
on to grad schools can have
letter grades if they feel grades
are necessary. At the same time,
people who feel no need to meet
grad school entrance require-
ments wouldn’t. have to. Each
student would make the choice
based on his own wants and
needs; there would be no institu-
tional grading policy to dictate
that choice.

It would behoove the Senate
to look into this alternative to

ment negotiate-d with North
Vietnam.

The bloodbath charges are al-
most all based on an alleged
bloodbath in North Vietnam
after the Viet Minh (Vietnam
Independence League) came to
power in 1954. Nixon has
claimed, for example, that ad
cording to the Catholic Bishop
of Danang, “half It million
people died in slave labor camps
in North Vietnam" between
1954 and 1956.

Recent evidence, however, re-
veals that not only is the charge
of a communist bloodbath com-
pletely untrue, but that the
myth was in fact fabricated and
developed by the CIA, British

the current grading system,
rather than rushing willy-nilly
into destroying the last of the
ﬂexibility that once made this
school so attractive to at. least
ong member of the student
body

Campus Crime'

To the Editor:

According to the ASP ('l‘ues-
day’s article entitled “Campus
Crime"), the suspect. a student
“upon being told to leave by
Clough, allegedly attacked
Clough. Security was called.”
Having been president I can say
that upon being fired by Clough,
for no reason, the student finish-
ed what he was doing. The stu-
dent upon leaving told Clough
that he would be in Monday to
speak with him and others be-
cause he felt he was being treat-
ed unfairly, especially in light of
the fact that employees had
been “allowed” to run illegal
gambling operation with no
penalty. The student also said he
would check Friday to see that
he was paid for the hours he
worked. Clough promptly told
the student that it. would do no
good to speak to anyone and
guaranteed the student at that
very moment that he would not.
receive his "just desserts
”...security was called.

The ASP made it seem that
the student had anticipated the
arrival of security Monday and
threatened them with a knife
upon arrival. Having been at the
scene I can again refute this

Intelligence, and other US.
government agencies.

In October, a former high of-
ficial of the Saigon government,
Colonel Nguyen Van Chau, told
a reporter from Dispatch News
Service International that the
alleged communist bloodbath
was “100 percent fabricated" by
intelligence services financed by
the U.S. government.

Chan was In a position to
know. From l‘in-‘l to 1962 he
was head of the “Psychological
Warfare Section" of the Saigon
army, an agency that took direct
part in spreading the bloodbath
myth.

As a child, very depressed, I
ran up to my father crying
“daddy, you told me the lion is
king of the jungle, but everytime
I read a book about lions, the
men always win. Why is that?"
My father said, "Son, it will be
that way till lions learn to

pcteer. And as for me, I can say

an “I” witness.

The Saigon government, he
said, waged “total psychological
warfare" in 1954 to 1966 to
persuade Vietnamese and world
opinion that there was a terrorist
bloodbath in North Vietnam.
The campaign included distri-
bution of fake leaﬂets (purpor-
tedly written by communists),
which threatened rcprisals
against Catholics, and the opera-
tion of a fake “liberation radio"
station, whose broadcasts sought
to give the impression that the
communists were carrying out
revenge killings.

Chau labels as “ridiculous” the
charge of the Bishop of Dunang,
cited by Nixon, that half a mill-
ion people died in slave labor
camps in North Vietnam.

Further evidence is revealed in
a recently published study by
Gareth Porter of the Cornell
University International Rela-
tions of East Asia Project.
Searching for the origins of the
blotidbath story, I’orter found
that almost all accounts of a
bloodliath in the works of such
well-known sriters as Bernard
Fall and Sir Robert Thompson
are either undocumented, or
based on accounts in a single
book: li‘roin Colonialism to

written in 1964 by Hating Vim

duit for CIA funds. The book

was then published and distri-
buted abroad by the U.S Infor-
mation Agencv.

Porter found that the blood-
bath charges in this book are
based on “fraudulent documen»
tation." For example, Chi him-
self admitted in a recent inter-
view in The Washington Post
that his claim of a bloodbath
aimed at Vietnamese landlords
was based on a single village, in
which one pt'rsun was supposed-
ly executed. On this basis, he
“guesses"thut 5% of the people
in the North were killed-1 ﬁgure
which Nixon translated in his
July 27, 1972 speech into a
“minimum of 500,000 people"
executed. Chi also made up
quotes from Viet Minh directives
which make it appear that they
had a deliberate policy of liqui-
dating the landlords.

The original purpose of the
bloodbath story, according to
Chau, was to justify Suigon's
rerun-“1.1.0 negotiate with Hanoi
on ways to carry out the elec-
tions and reuniﬁcation promised
in the 1954 Geneva Accords.

Since thew-encouraged, finun’
ced, and promoted by U.S. of-
ficials--it has become a full
blown myth. And the Nixon
administration is still invoking
these fabricated charges to jus-
tify its refusal to conclude a
peace agreement to end the war
in Vietnam.
