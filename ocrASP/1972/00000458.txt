Monrning BecOmes Electra in NYC

by Steve Aminoff .

People headed into New York City this Holiday Vacation have an
interesting feast of theatrical entertainment happening on a some‘
what revitalized Broadway. Although the achievements of the New
York Shakespeare Festival shows (Two Gentlemen of Verona, Much
Ado About Nothing, and That Championship Season) constitutes
most of the newe, the opening of Joseph E. Levine’s Circle-in-the-
Square on 50th St. with a version of O'Neill's “Mourning Becomes
Electra” seems equally thought-provoking. '

It’s quite appropriate that the Circle-in-the-Square should open its
gorgeous new subterranean theater with O'Neill. it was the original
“Circle” down in the villagewhich renewed interest in O'Neill in
1956 with its production “Long Day's Journey into Night." ’

“Mourning Becomes Electra" is O'Neill‘s revamping of Aeschylus
famed trilogy “The Orestia." The three plays, "Agamemnon," “The
Libation Bearers," and “The Eumenides” are set in a New England
town after the Civil War. The once proud, "Tara-like" house tended
by Mrs. Christine Mannon (Colleen Dewhurst) and daughter Lavrnia
Mannon (Pamela Payton-Wright) for the duration is shaken by the
return of Ezra Mannon (Donald Davis) father and keeper of the
precious family name. Ezra soon discovers infidelity on the part of
his wife from the lips of his adoring daughter Lavinia (Electra
anyone?)

Colleen Dewhurst, regarded by many as the premier actress of the
American stage, delivers a powerful performance as the woman
whose desires run incompatible with her situation. To be sure, her
actions with a young sailor, Adam Brandt (played effectively by
Alan Mixon) are adulterous. But we sense that these are actions
which come from deep seeded emotional deprivations which have
been gathering and gathering inside of her. Even as she poisons her
husband at the end of the first segment of the triology, we are
moved to feel a sense of pity for her intermingled with contempt. '

However if this play can be described as “stolen” by someone, it
was certainly Pamela Payton-Wright who made off With our

attention. She handled the leading role in the play, as the troubled
daughter Lavinia, with an inexhaustible amount of intent focus or.
what it was she had to do. Plus, the characterization was nor
one-dimensional as, I think, O'Neill’s text often was. All in all a Very
exciting piece of work from a fine young actress whose futon.
endeavors we look forward to.

So, we have a great start for what looks to be a strong theater m
the heart of commercialland. Also look for in the up-comm“
months: Irene Pappas in Euripides' "Medea"; and George C, Scott

Nicol Williamson and Julie Christie in Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya."

Rochester Dancers}

by Kathe Morehouse

Wednesday, November 2‘),
saw a most entertaining dance
group from the University of
Rochester, performing in the
SUN YA gym dance studio. Un-
der the direction of Mary Ful-
kcrson, [he Tropicer Fruit Coni-
pany, a group of about l5 mem-
bch, combined a circus with a
“happening” to prcscni a mix-
ture of dancing, gymnastics.
comedy, singing, and drama in ii
piece called "Mirage."

From beginning to end the 90
minuie show provided its aud-
icncc with several ricliviiics
occurring simulianiously on
which to I'crrsl. One of the qual-
iiics Ihal Marry I’iiIkcrson rc—

of this working as the dancers
improvised within the general
framework of "Mirage."

The most memorable sequen-
ces included the following. A
group of people are scaled to-
gether on the floor. A girl is
pulling pennies on their bodies.
One by one as they get up to
leich the pennies fall to the
floor.  Mary is sianding on one
side of the room wiih ahuge
pillow. A boy is standing some
(IISl‘dllCC away with a large box.
“Arc you ready madam?" he
asks. He gives Iicr a command.
“Make a clicking sound wiili
your pillow," She complies and
then says to Iiirn, kicking hcr
pillow. "Kick your box." llc
docs.

IIc - “Sqiiccxc your pillow."

Slic - “Pick rip your box by
[he corner."

 
  
 
 
 
 
   
     
     
   

 

  
 

He - “Stand on your pillow."

She - “Do a somersault on
your box." 

One of the most incredulous
stunts was the one that polished
off the evening. From the corner
of the studio there entered a boy
who was so tall he could have
washed the ceiling. He would
not have been considered tall
but Ihai his shoes were nailed to
boxcs, raising him to great
heights. He wore a bowler Iiat,
neck lie and [cc shirt and carried
a walking slick. Carrying 2i pile
of clothes in his arms, Iic slrollcd
over to the girl in the box (the
whole evening she hadn‘t step-
pcd outside this box) and gave
her ihc clothes. “Gel ready,“ he
said, walking away. Al [his point
onc‘s uitcntion was slril'icd to
activities elsewhere in Ihc studio.
The next time anyone was aware
of the girl in Ihc box was when
she was bciug Iificd oul of her
box and oiilo lhc shouldcrs of
sonic uiionymous pcrfornici. I
say anonymous bccrrusc in IlL‘l
long vclvcl drcss bcgiin lo slip

he had lllliilCllIlIUllSly dis-
