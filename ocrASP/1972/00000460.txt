“Charm of the Bourgeosie"

by Pam and Michael Rosenthal
Alternative Features Service

This is probably the most ele-
gant, sumptuously entertaining,
and uproarisusly funny shaggy-
dog story you are likely to en-
counter. ll. also seems to be a
profound comment on power,
fear, and the bourgeois mind-
-but contrived with all the deli-
cacy and slyness that one likes
to associate with age, wisdom,
experience. For Luis Bunuel is
72 years old, and this may be his
best film. It. is also his first great
popular success, and except for
the first-run prices involved, an
altogether happy event.

The bourgeoisie in question
include the ambassador of Mir-
anda, a mythical corrupt Latin
America republic; two wealthy
businessmen, their well-dressed,
well-coiffed wives; and a young-
er sister. The six form a tight
social circle, dining together, the
women meeting for cozy af~
ternoon teas, the men for big-
time cocaine deals, the amba-
ssador and one of the wives for a
civilized extramartial affair.

We first. encounter the ambas
sador, one couple and the
younger sister on route to a
dinner party at the other couple's
home. But. there has been a
misunderstanding; the host is
away on business and the hostess
insists that the dinner was
planned for the following even-
ing. No matter-brilliant smiles
all around-and the fiVe friends
are off to a nearby inn. where.
however, dinner plans are again
subverted. It. seems that the inn
keeper has died that afternoon.
and lies unappctizingly in Illi'
next. room, surrounded by wail-
ing stuff and family and awaiting
it tardy undertaker.

And so it continues. ()ur six
bourgeois are attacked by Lt-rror-
ists, and by their own sexual

desires; they endure police ar~
rests, military maneuvers, bad
dreams, and shortages of tea and
coffee. For the simple-minded
punchline of this shaggy-dog
story is that they never get. to
eat. Yet they meet. all inter-
ruptions and inconVeniences
with the same marvelously
bland, bright smiles, beautiful
manners, in short. with all the
discreet. charm that keeps the
social machine in repair, in a
world that constantly threatens
to go out of control.

Of course, things can go out of
control in any number of ways,
and the bourgeoisie, balanecd
neatly atop an unsteady social
pyramid, arc plagued by a wide
range of imminent disaster-from
mixed-up dinner plans to murder
by revolutionary tcrrorisLs'. The
fear of exposed. uni

dewy-eyed young soldier, to
which the assemblage listens as
though it. were a harpsichord
recital. Some dreams are not.
announced, though, but seem to
grow directly out of the fabric
of social life. Soon after the
young soldier‘s dream, our group
is seated at it formal dinner
party, in a room hung with red
velvet curtains. The curtains sud-
denly part and the bourgeoisie
discover themselves on a stage,
confronting a jeering, booing
audience, while ii prompter fren-
tically tries to feed them their

lines. They run offstage, in
terror and mortification, and
one of them, mercifully,

awakens from this nightmare.

Yet, as absurd and surreal as
this episode has been, we are as
surprised as the dreamer to find
it was only a dream--for the
ambiance is identical to that of
the dinner parties that hava pro
ceded it. Again, embarrassment.
is the imminent danger, and
keeping it at. bay is what the
bourgeoisie use their discreet
charm for. In the dream se-
quences, the ill—mannered world
takes over, as people in pre-
carious positions of power must
cvcr fear and dream that it will
do.

in a final dream sequence, the
group is gunned down merciless-
ly before they get their second
helpings of an absolutely perfect
roast leg of lamb. Though, ac
cording to Chairman Mao revol-
ution is not a dinner party, still a
ruined, shot-up dinner party, rid-
(llcd with blood and bodies, is a
fantastic visual symbol of anLi'
bourgeois revolution. But ii is
still a dream, and our a-
mbassador awakens. and gains
back control by raiding his rc-
frigeratiir and finally getting all
the roast lamli he wants, cram-
ming himself Willi an eagerness
that Huggt-sls gluttony, self-
immcrsion, and desperati- fcar.

lf painted by Hogarth, these
frames, almost ending the film,
could be titled U'l‘lic Final 'l'ri-
uniph of the Bourgeoisie," or
"'l‘hr- Illusory Triumph of the
Boiirguoisic," or "The
Bourgeoisie 'l'rlumphant- Until
Next Time " But as filmed by
Bunuel. all of these titles are
implicit in the rich, lusty image,
a nice one to remember from the
most satisfying film we have
won Ill a very long time.
