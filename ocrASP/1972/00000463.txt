by Richard Yanku

It is hard to say why the
Albany State Great Danes JV’s
lost as bad as they did to Mo-
hawk Valley of Utica, 82—55, on
Monday night. The Pups looked
like winners versus HVCC when
they pulled off a spectacular
rally in the waning minutes of
the game. MVCC did not impress
me as the well-rounded club that.
Hudson Valley has. Then, why,
did Albany lose as had as they
did? The first home game? the
home crowd? the live broadcast
of Gary Sussman and Harvey
Kojan on WSUA’.’ Here are the
REAL reasons.

1. Four members 01 the squad
were ill and were playing the
giime”undcr the weather." One
player, Royce Russell. was out
of service caused by a llrltll)
sprained right ankle.

2. “No exocution,‘ said llul)
Lewis, coach of the JV‘s The.
meaning that the players were
not doing what they were tolrl
to do in practice. This was uh
\‘ious while watching the l’iips
sult'er their second straight set
back.

i/HOUDAY SING

For the games in the future,
the Hartwick and JCA games are
too far away to tell what we can
expect of the Danes. Not enough
is known about Hartwick, ex‘
cept for the fact that they are a
private school and they have the
money to recruit good basket-
ball players. The same is true of
Junior College of Albany. Joe
Quigley. a former city of Albany
high school Basketball standout,
leads the run and gun for JCA
“Mensa in: point of production.

t‘oach Imwis' team has the
makes of a line hallcluh. Jim
lCisi-nman is a truu leader and
with ltnyce Russell hack in the
lineup, the l’ups should make
good for the rest of the season.
As for this reporter, this is his
last article for the ASP. The
reason: he is leaving for Great
Lakes, Illinois in January 4th for
hasii- training in the Navy. By
the time he gets out of basic,
Mill‘L‘ll Ist, llt‘ would like to see
the (treat Danes Varsity and JV
teams at the summit in their
respective divisions. ‘nood Luck
to IlRM, Ken, and the ASP
sports staff. Farewell, for this
reporter is (il't~ to see the world.

Vikings need this one to stay/in
and will gel it.

EAG LES vs. BEARS“
Dempsey will get heavy yardage
out at” his toe to lead Eagles to
upset uvnr Butkus and the Bears.

‘lllOl‘S vs. FALCONS’ Nobody
in lhat division really wants the
title. The loser of this game goes
ll)'l"llyl‘. Brodie is back but
unless he starts Spurrier will not
let him in before the game is out
iil' reach, Van BriltTlIllII will he
ill-illi'tl.
