by Kenneth Arduino

Dear Santa,

You were so good to us over
the past year. This is the last
issue before Christmas so I

thought I would drop you a
note. Please bring the following
to my friends.

For the running backs on the

TOWER EAST CINEMA PRESENTS

football team: some glue to hold
on to the hall.

For quarterback John Ber-
tuzzi: a pair of stilts to see over
the linemen and the continued
health of his offensive line.

For the defensive line: an
additional 15-20 lbs. without
losing any speed.

For Conch Ford: ll way of
keeping all his juniors more than

 

one more year and a field goal
kicker who is consistent inside
the fifty.

For soccer star Larry Herzog:
the recognition throughout the
state he richly deserves.

For goalie John Thayer: No
games in which he has to make
thirty or more saves and a season
without injuries.

For Coach Wingert: a good
year of recruiting and a better
year against the refs.

For cross-country runner Nick
DeMarco: A season without in-
juries.

For cross-country runner Vin—
nie Reda: A great spring season
and a victory over Siena's Joe
Rukanshagiza next year.

 

 

season.

For wrestler Jeff Albrecht: a
season without injuries.

For Larry Mims: the recog—
nition he deserves as one of the
top wrestlers in the area.

For Joe Garcia: a season
where there are two and three
wrestlers for every weight.

For the wrestling team: an
improvement from seventh in
the SU NY championship.

For Dave Welcons: the urge to
shoot more.

For Bob Rossi: the urge to
shoot less.

For Byron Miller: a complete
season without any problems.

For Werner Kolln and Rich

    

injuries.

For John Quattrochi: a year
free from knee injuries

For Doc Sauers: The recog'
nition he deserves as one of the
best coaches in the nation. in the
form of a NCAA bid.

For the NCAA rules com-
mittee and the selection com-
mittee: a giant box of red tape.

For the basketbiill team: A
portable gym so they always feel
at home.

For all the spring teams: an
early and dry spring.

For the entire university com-
munity and Santa: a happy holi‘

 

 

shutting down our high school
during that notorious May of
1970.

As we sat there thinking about
how different things were now,l
asked my old friend what. had
happened? He looked at me a
little confused; almost as if the
question was before its time, and
for a few seconds gave the illlt's-
tion some thought. His response
impressed me as being perhaps
the most adequate answer for
those of us who have given illt‘
question any consideration. He
said, “the ﬁrst time you get
kicked in the face you get angry,
the second time you get kicked
in the face you get scared. and
the third time you get, kicked in

American young men dying for

not made clear to us.

One of the ﬁrst thinlﬁ I
learned in an intro psych course
I took was that frustration leads
to aggression and chntually to
apathy. What could be more
frustrating than to know that
people are getting killed for the
defense of a dictator, for the

had to close and one reason was
that our rock heroes were asking
for too much money. The record
