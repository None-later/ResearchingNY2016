“In case ‘of fire"...are the
dorms at SUNYA adequately
equipped to insure the safety of
their residents? A combination
of safety measures including
heat sensors, fire drills and fire
extinguishers, are used to pro-
mote fire prevention and safety.

In " ' these ,
Mr. John Buckhoff, Director of
Physical Plant, said that there
are heat sensors or detectors on
the ceiling of each room on all
quads. “These are activated only
by hear, not smoke, and are the
rate of rise type detector," he
stated. This means that rapid
increases in heat trigger them.
They are activated when the
temperature in the room reaches
120 degrees F.

Once a hear sensor is activated

it rings that building's fire alarm
which in turn registers an alarm
in the heating plant. The loca-
tion of the "fire" is, punched on
a tape device and a Security
guard is immediately sent to
check the building. In the event
of a real fire, he radios back to
the base and the Albany Fire
I" _, is called by a direct
line which is kept clear between
the university and the fire de-
partment.

The dorm alarm registers first
at the SUNYA heat plant rather
than at the Albany Fire Depart-
ment due to the frequency of
false alarms. However, on the
downtown campus, due to the
added distance and time it
would take to send a security
guard there, the dorm alarms go
directly to the Albany Fire De-

partment and are answered
immediately. This makes false
alarms from this quad especially
hazardous. Albany Fire Depart-
ment equipment has been in-
volved in two automobile acci-
dents in previous years respond-
ing to Alumnae false alarms.
False fire alarms are a prob-
lem. Mr. Buckhoff said that
there have been, on occsasion as
many as six or seven false alarms
in one day. He commented,
"The people setting off these
alarms are playing a practical
Joke, so to speak, and don't
realize some of the consequences
that can result from it." Such
consequences include not only
the above automobile accidents,
but a tremendous waste of time
and energy, the discomfort for
residents who must vacate the

 

 Fire, A Safety. Measures Seenas Efficient

dorm, and the possibility of in-
juries resulting from dorm evac-
nation.

The six regularly scheduled
fore drills during the school year
are mandated by State Educa-
tion Laws. Most students are
familiar with these proceedings.
In the event of an actual fire, the
dorm evacuation would be the
same except that the building’s
power would be turned off by
the security guard in preparation
for the fire department’s arrival.
In this event, battery operated
emergency lighting for the halls
and stairwells goes on. Exit signs
also rr~nain lighted.

Finally, in all dorms on each
floor there is a water type fire
extinguisher. These can be used
to put out fires of burning pa-
per, wood or clothing but are

orried Housing Outlook

by Diana M. Cyganovicli

Directly across Fuller Road
from the State University Cam-
pus stands a piece of land he-
longing to the university. Origin-
ally, this area was to he the cite
of married student housing.
What stopped the construction?

Like some of the other plan-
ned facilities, married students
housing was never completed. In
August 1970, 140 married stu-
dents units werc on the drawing
board. Eventually 400 units
were to be built in this area. The
plan was to go out on bid, in
January 1971. Then the first

budget squeeze came in Decem-
ber l970. All plans for construc
tion stopped.

The State Dormitory AgenA
cy's sale of bonds did not meet
what was expected. Paying back
past bonds was becoming harder.
The Agency was receiving loss
income than expected. Onc rea-
son for this was the number of
vacant dormitory rooms. All
these rooms were counted on as
income. thn income fell short
l.l‘l(‘ Agency could not sell mori-
bonds, as they would ncvcr bi-
iihlo to pay liiick lbi- mimcy
when the bonds wcrc turncd in.
Therefore the squat-1c on mom-y

brought the whole construction
to a halt.

The need for married student
housing grows with the UniVer-
sity. Many students are getting
married before they finish their
undergraduate studies. Also be-
cause it is hoped that Albany
will grow as a graduate school,
and as more graduate students
are married than undergraduates,
this presents the university with
another serious problem. If
housing cannot be offered to
students Willi families, these stu-
dents may decide not to attend
SUNY at Albany.

There are apartments living
built in tlic city. Most of those,
though, ill'l‘ not geared toward
tlic studcnts. Whiil is nccdcd is

campus.

At this time it is not known
specifically where all the married
students live as the surveys are
not complete. But it is thought
that most married students now
live in better areas of the city.
They have cars and they would
rather commute than live where
their children have no playing
area. This becomes a greater
problem because housing in
these areas, at a price affordable
to students, is hard to find.

not to be used on electrical or
grease fires. In dorm equipment
rooms and in the kitchen units,
there are special 002 type ex-
tinguishers. All of these extin-
guishers are checked twice each
year.

The last serious ﬁre on com—
pus occurred three years ago in
State Quad’s Eastman tower. No
students were injured but a bed-
room burned. Fortunately, be-
cause the door to the room was
closed and because of the fire
resistant materials which are
used to construct the building,
the fire did not spread.

More recently, Mr. Buckhoff
stated that there how been only
four or five small wastcbiisket
fires---nathing serious or of any
consequence.

Poor

At one time the university
looked into the practicality of
converting Mohawk 'I‘ower into
apartments. After two state rcp-
resentativcs looked over the
structure it was decided that the
cost would be too great. Buildv
ing Il new structure would be as
much as the cost of converting
the tower. Therefore this idea
was scratched.

As for the future, the State
UniVersity still owns the land
across Fuller Road. There is ii
chance, although small, that
housing will be consti‘uctctl.

The Students Dwelling (Ioni-
pany Inc., an organization fll‘lll‘
ing with the problem, hzid hoped
to rcceivv loans from Housing
and Urban Dt'vt'ltillllll'nt. The

FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8, 197?.

        

 

by Ted Liban
Arnold Colon has been at

SUNYA for almost one year
now. He's seen two book rushes
during this time as Manager of
the Bookstore. The first (last
Spring) offered no problems.
The second (this semester) was a
totally different story. The over-
night book delivery system,
which liad worked so well the
previous semester collapsed.
Lines were as long as four hours;
some were even longer.

Yet Mr. Colon views next
semester optimistically. He is
conﬁdent that the overnight
system can be successfully rein-
stituted and waiting time cut
down.

To insure this several steps
have been taken. Beginning Mon-
day, January 15 (the first day of
classes) textbooks will be on sale
in the tunnel of the Physics
building from 6:00 AM to 10:00
I’M, Monday thru Friday, Satur-

day hours will also be offered, if
necessary. Between these hours
students can pick up their orders
and order books for immediate
delivery. For those who prefer
the more convenient. overnight
service the hours are 8:00 AM to
4:00 PM. All orders-will require
a $1.00 deposit. To prevent an
overload on the system similar
to this semester's, only 1,000
overnight orders will be taken
each day.

Woman Security Officer Named

by Judy Daymont

At 2:30 on Wednesday, Dec-
ember 6th in his own office, Dr.
Benezet officiated the swearing
in of two Security Officers.
What made the ceremony so
unusual is that one of those
officers happened to be a
woman, the first woman on the
SUNYA Security Patrol.

Her name, Denise Patton; she
is 20 and a native of Troy. She
graduated from Hudson Valley
Community College with a ma-
jor in Police Science. Taking the
oath with her was Frank Cun»
ningham, a three year veteran of
our Security Police, but whose
official induction was delayed
until be fulfilled ccrtaiii educa-
tional qualifications.

Spring Book Rush Procedure Detailed 4 

Once again used books will be
bought and sold. For texts that
were used at SUNYA and will be
used during Spring '73 the book.
store will pay ‘A the listed price
of new editions. For bargain
hunters the store has a new
gimmick. For anyone who sells
books to the store between now
and December 23 and does not
accept cash, a gift certificate
with a ten percent bonus will be
iavailable These certificates are
redeemable for any purchase in
the store until March 1.

Three Book Limit

Some courses, especially Eng
lish, require several texts. Most
students do not buy all. But all
have to be displayed. This hypo-
thetical situation clearly illus-
trates resultant problems. For
instance, suppose Joe is taking
an English course with seventeen
books. He already owns books
l,ll,5,7,and8, and only wants to

 

purchase books 2,4,and 6. He
gives his order to the runner
during book rush. Twenty min-
utes later he returns without the
books Joe needs. It seems that
the runner went through the
seventeen stacks for my course,
but could not find my books. So
after waiting on line for an hour
he’s told to come back In a few
days. He leaves empty-handed
and furious.

Preposterous? No! Ask any
English student about the hassle
in getting books.

To alleviate this profs have
been instructed by the store to
designate no more than three
texts as books needed immed-
iately. Only they will be avail-
able during the book rush. After
February 5, when the crowds are
gone students can go to the
bookstore and leisurely purchase
the rest of the texts.

NORMl Organized Here

A newly- formedcampus chap-
ter of the National Organization
for Reform of Marijuana Laws
(NORML) is holding its first
meeting Tuesday night for the
purpose of planning a strategy
for lobbying the Legislature
when it convenes in January.

(Jo-founders Mike McGuire
and Dan Sachs explain that
NOItML has been working on a
national lPVDl to legiili'Le mari—
juana use for the past several
years. NORML‘s most recent

activity was Proposition l9 in
California, a referendum which
would have legalized growing
and possessing pot if the voters
had approved. The measure lost
by about ii 2 to I margin. but
Francisco

(lid win in San

 

County.

In New York State, the prim-
ary objective has been to per-
suude the State Legislature to
lessen or remove the penalties on
use of grass. Guy Archer, a New
York City lawyer, was a part-
time lobbyist for NORML in the
Capitol during this past session.

Because of SUNYA's location
near the Capitol, McGuire and
Sachs hope that the school chap-
ter will concentrate on working
to change the minds of the
legislators so that they could
support decriminalization as a
first step toward eventual legal-
ization.

’I‘he NORML meeting is set
for 7:30 Tuesday night in either
CC 315 or CC 375.
