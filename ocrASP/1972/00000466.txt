sometimes by as much as 55%.
Design changes and differences
in size of construction sites were
blamed for the unexpected cost
increases.

Significantly, the report found
that community colleges have
fared much better in keeping to
original budget estimates.

The cost of constructing a
student center in the SUNY
university system was about 70%
greater than comparable centers
for community colleges the re-
port noted. And the cost of
science and physical education
buildings ran higher for SUNY
than for both private and com-
munity colleges.

In another major area—quality
—the Construction Fund was
again taken to task. Major
structural deﬁciencies were
discovered on a variety of cam-
puses across the SUNY system,
and these were. in the words of
the report, "neither insignificant
nor isolated. "

Pedestrian handrails were
missing at Fredonia, stage eleva-
tors were found faulty at Stony
Brook. Plattsburgh, Oneonta and
Fredonia and fire alarm systems
were inoperable or inaudible at
Fredonia and Buffalo College.
The report noted that some of
these deficiencies violated state
building codes.

Air pollution was found to be
a major problem at the Albany,
Stony Brook, Binghamton,
Plattsburgh, Oneontii, New

Paltz, Oswego and Brockpmt
campuses. In some cases, local
ofﬁcials threatened local cam-
puses with court orders to halt
the practice. Some rehabilitative
programs were planned to lessen
the pollution problem.

Roof leaks were another major
area of cmcern, especially at the
College at Canton Where aeces-v
saryrepairs to ten damaged build-
ings were estimated at $100,000
by the auditors—contradicting
the Construction Fund estimate
of $44,000.

Major acoustical problems
dominated the Albany campus
where $100,000 was spent im-
proving a total of 92 separate
rooms.

Major electrical underground
cable repair at Binghamton will
cost some $300,000, according
to the report.

At New Paltz, the 'hcating
problem was so acute that one
faculty member reported a
temperature of 128 degrees in
his ofﬁce. it took a special
faculty committee and a letter
from the New Paltz Emergency
and Welfare Committee to get
necessary repairs expedited.
$220,000 was allotted for repair
work, the problem was diag-
nosed as inadequate design in
the original architectural plans.
The original architect wiis rc-
hired to make the necessary
repairs—and received a new
contract with additional
compensation. The illustration,
according to the report, is an

example of the all-too-frequent
practice "of additional compen-
sation for inadequate initial per-
formance."

The report also noted that the
money for much of the repair
work comes from the operating
budgets of the individual cam-
puses involved-thus straining
already tight budgets that
support normal college opera-
tions.

The commission members
noted that a consequence of
these dmigrrrelatred problems is
more costly maintenance for
local campuses and SUNY.’ it
said the problems stemmed from
a "complete lack of proper super-
vision of the work by architects
and engineers." '

The report went on to criticize
individual architects for placing
visual appeal above more
practical considerations. it cited
the example of an architect at
Oswego who repeatly placed exit
signs out of eyesight—in viola-
tion of the building code—-
because “the placement of such
signs compromised the archi-
tect‘s concept of quality design.

Amherst Explored

’Ihe committee members also
conducted a broad survey
designed to determine how satis-
fied those who used campus
facilities actually were. Over
2,200 students and 150 faculty
members were questioned on
four SUNY campuses (Albany,
Binghamton, Fredonia and New

future of Waterman Case Uncertain

conlinueol from page one

This reporter saw Deans
Hunsbcrger and 8ch about the
figures, and asked them whether
the new information would have
much effect on the final out
come of the case. Their
responses were quite different.
Berri was expectcdly noncomm-
ittal, but Moyer Hunsbcrgcr,
Dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences, vehemently denounced
them, saying that they were
“worthless” and "don't prove a
thing. " interesting contrast.

Another interesting piece of
information was uncovered this
week, namely that there are scv~
and faculty members in the

Psychology Department who
have been recommended by
Hunshcrger for “discretionary

salary increases" and promotion.
Professor J. H. Bowen for
example, had only one L‘ltlllJOl’i
but has been rccommcncd for
both a salary hike and report

cdly to full professorship.

Waterman secs some incon-
sistency in this, since she rev
ceivod eight citations and can't
even get tcnurc, much less
promoted.

The profs recommended for
pay increases (with the number
of citations after their names)
includc: N. Grccufcld (0), J.
Maucuso (l), J. ’l‘. ’l‘cdcschi
(iii), J. ii. Bowen (1) and ME
Emu (0).

Hunsbcrgcr did not comment
on the alleged inconsistencies,
but claimed that the citation
figures are meaningless because
they "don't go into enough
depth" and don't explain what
thLI articles were about." “I!
feels that all of the figures
should liich lici-n much higher,
particuliiry for Profussur J.
'l‘udcachi, whose output is L‘lill'
sidcrcd voluminous. According
to the Dean, the enthusiasm for

Paltz). Five major conclusions
were reached:

—Students and faculty
generally felt the actual physical
design of their campus and their
classroom facilities were satisfac-
tory.

--'I'hey physical campus itself
was generally rated more favor-
able .than individual classrooms.

—Students were generally more
satisﬁed than faculty.

—Science students and faculty
were more satisfied than were
social science students and
faculty.

——Lecture Halls were preferred
over classrooms and laboratories.

From these findings, the legis-
lative study concluded “that
emphasis has apparently been
placed on campus visual
aesthetics and design and less
emphasis...on classroom use."

The auditors also examined the
SUNY-Buffalo Amherst campus
and criticized its high sight-
development costs. They
claimed the Bizat Creek on the
campus was relocated, at a cost
of $4.5 million, when it could
have been re-routed at a cost of
about $l million. But Construc-
tion Fund officials disputed the
auditor's figures and said the
cost of relocation have been
closer to $17 million.

Auditors also mentioned that a
campus lake was being constru~
cted at a cost of $5.5 million.
Construction Fund officials
argued that the lake was created
to provide Fill dirt and would

actually have several million
dollars.

Finally, auditors criticized
SUNY for its ambiguity on the
exact amount it was committed
to spend on the entire Amherst
project and its vacillation on the
actual function of Amherst. The
auditors claimed that such inde-
cision led to higher planning
costs.

The Trustee decision in 1971
to limit enrollment to 30,000
and restrict expenditures on the
project to $650 million clarified
the magnitude of the Amherst
project and had several long
range goals—including the
elimination of most student
housing on the Amherst campus,
the report said.

interestingly, the findings of
the legislative committee parallel
some of the findings of an audit
done by State Comptroller
Arthur Levitt's office about one
year ago.

Both reports praised the
construction fund for accom-
plishing its objectives 05 success-
fully completinga multitude of
construction projects and so,
allowing SUNY enrollment to
increase. But many of the same
shortcomings were found as
well.

Both groups criticized SUCF
for lengthy construction delays.
Both issued an appeal for SUCF
and SUNY to work closer
together. And both noticed a
variety of structural defects
throughout the SUNY system.
