various groups have contributed
to the amount of events

Education. A depository library
is one legally designated to re-
ceive without charge copies of
publications by a particular
issuing agency.

of higher education, received by
the SUNYA library are “Where

Other research has focused on
cultural or political aspects of
high education on international
programs and on student unrest.
A final report is scheduled for

New Traffic Regulations

Changes in SUNYA traffic re-
gulations as directed by the NYS
Department of Transportation
have been made public by Mr.
Karl Scharl, Assistant Director
for Security.

Perimeter road has been desig-
nated a primary road, whereby
all trafﬁc from auxiliary roads
and parking lots is required to
yield right of way. In some
instances STOP signs are or will
be posted at intersections.

One-way roads on campus in-
clude the Administration Circle,
the small road in front of the
Physical Education Building and
the two main entrances to the
campus. The Circle and the Gym
roads are one-way in a counter-
clockwise direction.

The main entrance on Washing-
ton Avenue just north of the
Circle is northbound on the east-
ern access and soulbound on the
west, while the same holds for
the Western Avenue entrance.
All but the Gym road have been
previously designated as one»
way.

The speed limit for Perimeter
Road is 30 m.p.h. All other
areas, including parking lots, ac-
cess roads and service roads, are
I F) m.p.h.

Parking is prohibited on all
campus raods with the exception
of areas on the Administration
Circle posted with signs.

Caution is advised during the
next fcw wceks while adjust»
mcnts are being made. Several
Intersections ol'l'cr potentially

dangerous situations and moto-
rists arc urgi-d to be particularly
alcrt.

Colonial to be Paved

Just prior to intercession
break, John Hartley, Vice Presi-
dent for Management and Plan-
ning, announced plans for Colo
nial Quad Parking lot improve-
ments.

Prompted by complaints con-
cerning sloppy conditions in the
lot, the University Community
Council put in a request that 1)
the Colonial lot be paved as soon
possible, 2) until it is paved,
sufficient gravel be spread in the
lot to prevent further dangerous
rutting, 3) temporary alternative
parking space be found for some
Colonial residents to relieve
some pressure on the lot and, 4)
a public statement be made by
Hartley's office giving the expec-
ted time of paving and detailing
reasons it cannot be done any
faster.

Hartley’s office replied that
plans for remedying the situa-
tion have been underway for
some time. They claim the lot
cannot be paved until Spring
because the weather is too cold
and the asphalt would not ad-
here.

Meanwhile the directive has
been given to grade the lot and
spread morc gravel to tcmporiiri‘
Iy mollify the situation.

Indian Extension Completed

The Indian Quad parking lot
extension was completed prior
to intercession. Reportedly it is
now open for use and studcnts
are requested to park in the
facility. Beginning Monday,
January 29, Security will begin
to issue tickets to cars parked on
thclawn.

clared unconstitutional by a
