TYiiiiiti rare Discount

The Easter and summer plans
of many SUNYA students will.
be severly affected by the elim-
ination of discount youth an-
nounced Dec. 7 by the Civil
Aeronautics Board (CAB). The
National Student Lobby (NSL)
and senior citizen groups are
seeking to reverse the CAB de-
cision through Congressional
action. C All voted 3-2 that
domestic yonth fares are un-
justly discriminatory and should
no longer be permitted. The
decision implied the same fate
for international youth fares.

"The wolf is at the door,” said
NSL Executive Director Layton
Olson. "Although CAB has set
no specific date for terminating
youth fares pending a hearing
early in 1973, on the effect of
such a move. the discounts could
very well end as early as March."

“Since Congress can prevent
CAB from eliminating youth
fares, students should ask Con-
gressmen Harley Staggers (D-W.
Va.). John Jarmen (D‘Okla.) and
Sam Devine (R'Ohio) to insure
that the House Interstate and
Foreign Commerce Committee
sends the youth fare question to
the House floor during the first
half of 1973," said Olson.
“StUdents can also ask their own

congressmen and senators to
vote for youth fares when the
question comes up.”

Senators Frank Moss (D-Utah)
and Charles Percy (R-lll.) and
Cong. James Harvey (R-Mich.)
introduced bills in the last Con‘
gress authorizing discount fares
for both youth (under age 22)
and/or senior citizens (over age
65). The youth and aging groups
made a powerful coalition. The
Moss-Percy bill passed the Sen-
ate but died in a House-Senate
conference due to a stalemate on
another issue. NSL will inform
its 200 member schools and
other students when such bills
are reintroduced.

"CAB will continue to defer
final cancellation of youth fares
if students and Congress start to
take action," said Russell
Lehrman, head of Continental
Marketing Corp., a Houston-
based youth fare sales concern.

In 1968 CAB reversed its own
examiner when college students
protested the examiner's decision
that youth fares Were unjustly
discriminatory. CAB'vVas soured
on youth fares since then after
receiving mail from older traVB-
lers and legal pressure from Con-
tinental Trailways Bus System,
which has lost riders due to low

 

  

air fares.

0n the current decision CAB
Chairman Secor Browne, Vice
Chairman Whitney Gillilland and
member Robert ’l‘imm voted to
end youth fares. CAB members
Roberty Murphy and G. Joseph
Minetti voted to keep them. The
majority admitted that the dis-
count fares undoubtedly gene-
rate more traffic for airlines. But
the board argued that the fares
are closed to people who would
otherwise travel discount fare
and are open to people who
would otherwise travel full fare
to an extent that this age discri-
mination is unjust. The minority
argued that the discounts raise
so much added revenue that,
rather than burden full fare pas-
sengers, they beneﬁt these tra-
velers by contributing to com-
mon fixed costs. Moreover, if
any airline feels it’s losing on
youth fares, they can cut or
abolish the discounts, the dis-
senters added.

As NSL points out, airlines
make healthy profits on youth
fares except when guaranteeing
reservations. Some airlines have
scheduled extra planes for youth
fare passengers while others have
officially offered reserved seats
at youth fare pricr-s. Both dc

rounding areas. This capability
was designed into the system by
008. Undir the old tie line
system th’re were no toll
charges. You may recall that we
were given access the the NYS
tie line networl by 068 in
1969.

Because of the high cost and
heavy volume of these local toll
calls on the tie line system,
especially after normal office

 

hours, OGS proposed to remove
SUNYA from the tie line not-
work cffi-ctive December I,
l972. After hurried conferences,
both on this campus and with
005, we were granted a tem-
porary reprieve by 068 with the
understanding that we would im
plement controls to restrict lll'
line usage and to curtail non-
offictzil calls.

Currently, ()(lS is conducting
an extensive examination of calls
made on the tie liiti- network to
determine whether frequently
called numbers are of an official
business nature. ll' calls can be
identified as not official, the

facto and official guaranteed-
seat youth fares are very unfair
and uneconomiciil in comparison
to standby fares. However, the
board lumped both kinds of
fares together in its argument
that the fares are not sufficiently
successful in generating passen-
gers rind rcVenue to warrant (its
crimiiiating against middle-aged
passengers.

Youth fares were made to
attract passengers who did not
have settled travel habits. The

, .[

 

restricted standby discounts
were justified on the grounds
that young people have more
time than money while many
middle-aged travelers are busi-
nessmen with travel (-xpensv
accounts and fixed schedules.
