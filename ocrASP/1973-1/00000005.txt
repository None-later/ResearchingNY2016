A I Vet's Life
After
Discharge

Having defended the U.S. gov-
ernment's policies in Vietnam,
members of the Vietnam Veter-
ans Against the War (VVAW)
now have to defend themselves
against the same government at
home, and Alton Foss seems to
have achieved the dubious dis~
tiiiction of being the focus of
the government effort against its
own veterans.

Alton Claude Foss Jr. joined
the Navy after graduating from
high school in 1964. In high
school he was selected for Na-
tional Honor Society and Won
letters in football. basketball and
track. The all American boy
enlisted at age chenteen and
graduated from Field Medical
Sci'Vicc School at Camp Le
Jeunc, NC, He volunteered for
“sea duty" aiitl was assigned as a
liospitalman 3rd class to the 2nd
Battalion. 91h Marines, 3rd Ma-
rine Division in Vietnam.

In May of 1966 Foss was
accompanying a group of Marine
engineers as part of a security
force. They ran into an ambush.
He was wounded twice In the
left leg, his bones shiittcretl by
aii AK- l7 machine gun. l'lc was
“nicdci c'd" to Charlie Miitldon
Hospital in Danang. llc under
chI thc first of ten operations
on liis leg on tlit- way back to
the status.

Doctors did not put his Icg in a
cast. lit-cause tlic wountl was still
draining. instead. they put him
in traction at Key Wcst Medical
(‘i-iitci', Filtl'lliil, and thc strap
tlial held his lt-g tip cvvnlually

Notes On Soviet Youth, Black Market, Jewry

by Gary Riccinrdl

Lenin is More Alive than the
Living.

This slogan, posted prominent-
ly in a Leningrad airport, is
typical of the veneration the
Soviet government urges its
citizens to pay to their country
and its revolutionary beginnings.
l was fortunate to spend two
weeks recently in Soviet Russia,
and even more fortunate that
the time I spent there coincided
with the patriotic eclcbration of
thc unification of the various

Enormous cloth paintings of
Lciiin, Marx and Engels, and
smaller portraits of various lit-ro-
cs of the Revolution, hung from
all government buildings in the
i'ilics Ami-rictin nationalism,
t-spccially around patriotic holi-
days, is rart-Iy less than blatant,
but cvitli-nccs of Sovii-t patriot-
ism arc lit-avy cnough to stun llic
frircign visitor.

What lcavcs a far more lasting
tiiiprt-ssioii, howchi‘, is not thc
gaudy ornaments, but the
siiici-rc patriotism of much of
llit- liusstan pi-oplc. Matty, tis-
pccially those to whom the tourist
is introduced through ofﬁcial
chaiincls, nicrcly rcpcat the

Western pop music is very

Jewish culture in the Ukraine;
now, however, there is only one
synagogue there which is still
used for worship. Despite
Russia‘s long tradition of anti-
-semitism, this decline is also
attributable to the Nazis who
occupied Kiev for three years in
the Second World War, and who
either shot or transported to
camps thousands of Kiev's Jews.

The synagogue in Kiev is a very
old, ornate structure in the
Podol, the oldest section of
Kiev. The synagogue’s Jews are
all old men, and the old men
appear to be the last of Russia's
practicing Jews.

Young Jews, however, have a
strong st'nst‘ of identity, despite
their nonvobservance of religious
practice. They see themselves as
a group singled out for political
and social persecution. One Jew
in Kiev related that a month
before a friend of his had ap-
plied for permission to emigrate,
and a week later he disappeared
without a traco. Another Jew
posed a riddle:

“Why is Red Square the high-
cs‘t point in all Russia?"

“Because from there, you can
we Siberia."

The Look of the Cities

Moscow, Kiev, and Leningrad
are all very clean cities by west-
ern standards, and Moscow is
eSpecially so. The streets are
spotless, and the subways, called
the Metro, are fast, smooth, and
of course, clean. The Metro stat-
ions are lavishly decorated af-
fairs, replete with statuary, chan-
delicrs, white tile floors, and
marble walls and ceilings. Public
transit, including busas and troll-
eys, is the most popular means
of transportation. Public trans-
portation is cheap (slightly more
than 5 cents), and buses and
trolleys are operated on the
honor system.

Traveling from Moscow to
Kiev is, perhaps, like traveling
from New York to Nashville. ln
Kiev, the people are more open;
the pace is slower, and the City is
far less exciting. Kiev lacks the
Kremlin and the great museums,
but it is a much greener city:
sixty percent of Kiev is parks,
and in the summer months, it is
a popular resort.

Leningrad, however, is the
most beautiful of the three. Pre-
-p|anned and built by Peter the
Great, it is a city of palaCes,
cathedrals, and long, wide.
straight streets. The City is more
Western than the other two, and
this influence can be seen in the
architecture (much of it Italian),
tasted in the food, and seen even
in the strcets, which are slightly
dirticr than Moscow's.

Although Western newspapers
have reported urban crime is
increasing in the Soviet Union,
nevertheless, the cities are far
safer than most American cities.
Dark ctitryways and alleys can
be entered without fear of pun-
ishment, and the poorer sections
of the cities that I saw are, if run
down, far cleaner than American
slutns. No sluni is an enviable
