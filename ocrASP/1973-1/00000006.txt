by Joseph Daugherty

We see a distorted picture of the cinema of other countries.
Because of the nature and ‘politicsof film 'distribution we
see only a small part of the world's output of feature films and, for
the most part, we see the best. This cinematic tunnel-vision often
works to the best interests of the country in question. We assume all
Swedish films are marked with the maturity of Ingmar Bergman, all
Itslinn films must be of the some quality as those of Fellini and
Visconti, and all French film is us sophisticated as the work of
Rohmer and Truffaut. It is ll minor self-deception as these things go.
There is a great deal of film in this world that we don't get to see.
It's ii little like inspecting Hanoi after the bombings; as sincere as we
may be, we are still being shown only what "they" want us to see.

As I stated, this selectivity often works to the advantage of the
nation in question. The major exception has been Japan. For the
past twenty years one could assume from the Japanese films released
in this country that the only things made there were films the hill. of
Son of Godzilla and The Attack of the Mushroom People. Either by
accident or design the body of Japanese cinema has been inaccessible
to us until recently,

Over the next three weeks, the International Film Group, funded
by student tax, will present examples of Japanese cinema at its
finest:

Tonight (Friday, the 19th) Akirn Kumsawa's Ilri'ru (Living) will be
shown in Lecture Center 25 at 7:15 and 10:00. The film is the story
of an aging bureaucrat who has worked at the same job for thirty
years and learns- he is about to die of gastric cancer. Kurosawa,
perhaps best known for his Raslionion, explores the old man's mind
as he slowly concludes that he has done nothing important or lasting
with his life and his frenzy to complete some contribution to the
world before his death. 'I‘iikashi Shimura's performance as the
doomed civil servant who tries to justify his existence by building a
children's playground is legitimately touching.

Kurosawa has always been a director fascinated by the manipula-
tion of time as he demonstrates in this film by his bold use of a
complex series of flashbacks.

'ln Friday, January 26th, Kcnji Mizoguchi’s (.lgelsu Monogatari
wi. be presented in Lecture Center 25 at 7:15 and 9:45. Ugelsu is

an example of the "JidaiAGcki" period/costume film set in a small
rural vi liigc til the end of the sixteenth century. it is a time of war,
which)neans danger and violence, but also prospering business for
Genju o, the potter. Gcnjuro wants to stay in business and make as
much out of the war as he can with the help of his son. His son,
however, is determined to become a warrior.

The film is an ode to peace and tranquility in the form of a parable
about the short-sighledness of Genjuro and his- son, in their greed for
money and fame they will find nothing of real value. The Japanese
have a history of beauty and serenity played agiinst decades of
horrible civil war. The “Jedai-Gcki" film is a while flower growing in
a bloody battlefield. They are among the most beautiful and
emotionally rich films in the world and llgl‘fs'll is one of the best of
the genre

The fund film in Lllt' series will be presented on Friday, February
2nd, at 7.15 and 10:00 in Li-clurc Center In. Sima No ()niiu
