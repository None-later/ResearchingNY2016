The University Art Gallery of
State University of New York at
Albany soon will offer a remark-
able exhibition experience, the
"discovery" of a previously un-
known civilization, “Llhuros.”
All of the fragmentary remnants
of the “Llhuroscian culture" —
its utilitarian and ritual objects,
its scientific instruments, its
architectural ruins - are in
fact the conception of a single
contemporary artist, Norman
Duly, professor of painting and
sculpture at Cornell University.

Besides creating “artifacts,”
Daly has written Llhuroscitin
poetry and music and has estab
lished a considerable body of
Llhuroscian scholarship. The ex-
hibition will present Llhuros as a
_“real" ancient civilization for
archaeological, anthropological
and aesthetic study. it will not
expose the work as that of an
individual artist.

The exhibition to be on view

at the University Art (iallcry
from Monday, January 15,
through March 11 will consist of
more than iOO objects including
sculpture paintings and far
similes from temples, photo-
montages, and the like. Larger
dramatic pieces include tt-mplt-
doors, huge fragmean of frost-
cues, and a full-scale, spectacular
temple wall, decorated in has
relief. Taped sound will provide
music, translations of ritual
chants, anti an interview wtllt
noted Llhtiroscitin :ttitltritpo
logists.

The implications of th' (.‘Xltl‘
bition and Daly's concept go
well beyond imitation and [)ill’lr
dy. The “artifacts” are described

as quite beautiful, their qualities
enduring independent of the
Llhuroscitin context. Many are
ingeniously constructed out of
found objects, carefully patin-
ated to suggest an ancient origin.
The degree of disguise varies,
offering constant challenge to
the visitor's innocent assump-
tions of the reality of the
ancient culture anti of the rclitt»
bility of his own senses. The
ambiguity is heightened through
the use of real stone and marble
pieces appearing among those of
heavily encrusted styrofoum,
plastic and similar materials.

Likewtsc, the chants ol ltumtin
voices are interspersed willt L‘IOL”
ironically generated sounds
Thus, the unsuspecting visitor
first t-nlt-rs to receive straight-
forward information, to S('t'
works of logically varied scale
and purpose, to sense it consis-
tency of style and ancient sur-
faces 7 all factors which permit
ltim to Ihtlkf‘ an initial leap of
faith, to willingly suspend dis-
belief and accept the civilization
as authentic Presented also with
