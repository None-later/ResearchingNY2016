Last semester, the ASP printed
a series of articles. about pro-
feuors currently up for tenure.
You all remember the Water-
works Case--the professor, peda-
gogue, and champion of the stu-
‘dents ‘ wh'd"was” blackballed by
her department‘for what ap-
peared to be an advanced case of
cooties. You recall the admini-
stration's fair and just subjective
opinion of student support for
this professor. It seemed to me
that there was something more,
something different lurking be-
tween the lines of this tale.
Here’s the story as it really
happened: ,

Once upon a time last semes-
ter, Dr. Carillon Waterworkst
the Psychology Department
went through the mill for
tenure. Alter being swatted and
paddled around the department,
it became evident to her many
student supporters that the
administration was also pre-
paring a good spank. Students
manned tables at dinner lines
recruiting signatures from other
students in favor of helping
Waterworks, and the ASP began
full coverage of the case, but the
real clincher was a "letter to the
editor" published in the ASP.
The mighty pillars of S.U.N.Y.A.
began to tremble even while the
presses rolled.

That day, in Social Sciences,
one of Waterworks' colleagues
overreacted to the letter. It
claimed that Dr. Waterworkds
was the “best teacher" in the
entire Psych Department. “How
can you do this to me?" wailcd
the colleague, tcarfully shaking a
copy of the ASP at Waterworks.
"You are no! the best teacher,l
am, ‘Cause lsaid," he cried. He

then pouted and stuck out his
tongue. Just then, Scoop non
Troppo,. who was covering the
story for the ASP came on the
‘scene. The wimpering professor
spied non Troppo, tWeeked the
young reporter’s nose for news
and grabbed his lapel. “You’ll
pay for this, you little drip!" he
cried (as he shouted) and would
have wrung the reporter out had
something in his libido not
halted him. The professor then
sulked away from Waterworks’
office. “I’m telling," he said.

The case eventually led its way
to the ivory and plush offices of
a member of the administration.
Student supporters were there
granted the pleasure of an inter-
view with Oy More Hamburger,
Dean of Arts and Seances. As
the students seated themselves,
the Dean shifted his eyes and
made a nervous twirling motion
with his fingers at the corner of
his waxy moustache. The group
of students presented him with a
petition, signed by 2,360 stu-
dents.

“What's this? What’s this?" de-
manded Hamburger with a cor-
dial sneer.

“A petition signed by..." be-
gan a quuking student.

“If it has anything to do with
Dr. Waterworks' case for
tenure," interrupted the dean,
“you can be sure we will make
the fairest decision."

The students continued, “This
is a petition signed by 2,360
students in favor of granting Dr.
Waterworks tenure."

“Toilet paper!" shouted the
dean as he tossed the petition in
the face of the closest studean.
“Numbers are a humbug! I want
facts!" He reached into his desk
and whipped out the paper with

the psychology faculty’s vote
not to reinstate Dr. Waterworks.
“There! 8-1! And that’s a fact!"
he leered.

“But what about the student
evaluations? What about the vast
majority of enthusiastic students
appraising Waterworks?" pro-
tested the students.

“Of no use, whatsoever.
S.U.N.Y.A. students don't know

‘ anything," he said with a dis-

missing wave of his claw. “Now
this!" he continued, shaking
sheets of parchment before
them, “is an evaluation!" He was
referring to Psych Department
chairman Teethin’s report oni
Dr. Waterworks. Hamburger
cleared his throat and read:

Dr. Waterworks may be loved
and revered by her sludcnls, but
I think she's pretty mediocre
myself. She may be extremely
active in student affairs, but I
think it's 010! of nonsense. Her
research is minimal; she's been
published only eight times in the
last four years, not enough to
make the Psych Departincnl im-
pressive, And [JESides-J think
she's neurotic.

"Ha-Ha!" laighed the dean as
he held up the parchment.
“Facts, ladies and gentlemen!
Pure facts!" He leaned back in
his black leather chair. “Only
eight times, huh? That’s...let me
see..." and he reached for his
adding machine. “That’s...ah...
oh yes. Here it is. That’s two
times a year! Published only
twice a year! And everybody
knows we want quantity, not
quality around here.”

One Waterworks supporter ask-
ed if students might be able to
attend the final deciding meeting
of the Faculty Personality Com-
mittee. Dean Hamburger leaped

up and shouted, “NO!” Then he
slithered down one muttered,
“Who do you think runs this
joint?”

In the last phase of the case,
Scoop non Troppo got his hands
on some hot evidence ~- the
Science Citation index report. It
appeared that Waterworks had
been cited 8 times for her re-
search last year - 8 more times
than six tenured.members other
department and more times
altogether than ten members of
the department.

When University President
Benzedrine was asked about the
signiﬁcance of these statistics, he
said, “I wash my hands of it."
When Dr. Teethin’ was ap-
proached he meerly said, “I'm
not telling."

So once again, the mighty
pillars of S.U.N.Y.A. shook.
Once again, the students’ sup-
port of Carillon Waterworks was
justified. And once again, the
Psych Department had temper.

And back in the chandeliered
administration building, Scoop
non Troppo interviewed Oy
More Hamburger. The reporter
asked the dean what he thought
of Dr. Waterworks being cited
by more sources that the major-
ity of her colleagues.

“Crap!” broiled Hamburger.
But the dean quietly regained his
usual cool and slimy composure
and shrugged his shoulders.
“These numbers mean nothing
to me."

And the
trembled.

On October 10, at a pretria
hearing on the drug charge
Criminal Judge Murray Good<
man denied Foss the right to
have William Kuntsler as an
attorney. Goodman stated tha
Kuntsler could function as con-
sulting attorney, but could not
address the court or the jury. In
his motion to deny Kuntsler the
right to represent Foss at the
drug trial Assistant State’s Attor-
ney Robert Kaye repeatedly
made reference to the “circus
style atmosphere" that Kuntsler
might bring to a courtroom.
Apparently, Judge Goodman
accepted this argument: “I
would not allow disruptive pro-
ceedings in this court," he said
in gagging Kuntsler. Carol Scott,
a Gainesville attorney who was
supposed to assist Kuntsler iit
the drug trial said that she was
to do the research and the pre-
trial while Kuntsler was to be
the primary attorney. “That’s
what he was retained for,” she
said. So, having been denied
Kuntsler's assistance, Alton elec-
ted to defend himself. Goodman
appointed Public Defender Phil
Hubbert to be at Foss's side
throughout the trial in case he
changed his mind.

Foss was not very successful as
an attorney and was convicted
on November 20 of the felony
charge. He is scheduled to be
sentenced on December 14th
and could get up to five years in
prison.

After 0.5. Involvement: What T

byWiIIiam L. Ryan
AP Special Correspondent

(As‘the’ United States gets clo-
ser and closer to pulling out of
the Indochina quicksand, the re-
lief felt by leaders around the
world is going to be mixed with
apprehension in some areas.

The whole outlook for South-
east Asian leaders is about to
change radically. They will be
looking at a new and unfamiliar
sort of ball game.

The Nixon Doctrine

The Nixon Doctrine assumes

that the United States will avoid
future military involvement on
Asian soil. Southeast Asian mi-
tions are on notice that their
defense is primarily their own
problem, and that they enjoy
only the sort of protection that
is implicit in U'.S. power and
influence.

Their fingers crossed, ll‘lt‘SI'
leaders are hoping that China's
quarrel with the Soviet Union
and the need of each of the two
Communist giants to develop
new relations with the Ameri-
cans will provide a measure of
insurance while they prepare for
a painfully uncertain future.
Guerrilla movements, revolution-
ary pressure and outside en-

couragement of violence still
plague the area as it uneasily
prepares to make its peace with
Peking.

Honeymoon Over?

Once a Vietnam cease-fire
seemed near, Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia and Singapore began
comparing notes. All had been
accustomed to the comfort of
the US. presence on the con-
tinent. Now some of these lea-
ders sound like boys whistling
their way past the graveyard.

Primc'Ministcr Lee Kuan Yew
of Singapore visited Thailand rcv
ccntly and noted that the period
immediately after U. S. dis-
engagement in Vietnam “may
not necessarily be characterized
by peace and stability.” That
could turn out to be the under
statement of llll‘ your.

the Soviet Union, China and the
European Common Market will,
by their built-in conflicts of
interests, create a situation can-
celing out pressures on South-
east Asia. But meantime, he
says, the area "should use the
time given to us by the Ameri-
can presence to consolidate our
domestic systems and cooperate
with each other."

The Middle East:

Probably the No. 1 foreign
policy priority for Washington
after Vietnam is the Middle East,
where a lot of dynamite waits
for a detonator. That situation is
even more sticky for Americans
because the 0.8. energy crisis
puts greater emphasis all the
time on Middle East oil.

The Soviet leadership at the
moment appears both to want
and to fear continued turmoil in
the area, and puts on an odd-
liioking show. It denies Egypt
the wherewithal that might
tempt Cairo to bow to domestic
pressures and forget about pos-
sible settlement but at the same
time seems to encourage Syria in
calculated provocations of Lsmcl.

attitude, seems even more hurt
by his rich Arab brethren in the
oil nations who go on reaping
golden dollar harVests when they
could just as well be threatening
to create an oil crisis. What kind
0f Arab unity is it when Arab
rulers fail to take advantage of
such an obvioust promising
handle?

There‘s no real insurance that
some day the crisis mightn‘t
come anyway, touched off by
new hostilities provoked, for
example, by Syrian belligerence.
Damascus has been openly chal-
lenging th Egyptians to engage
in a new bout with Israel.

In Europe:

President Nixon wanted to get
back into the European picture
as soon as possible, to make
1973 a “year of Europe" for U.
S. policy. With Americans out of
Indochina, he will have a better
chance of getting that project on
the road.

bloc in the relaxation it could
bring, in the contamination it
could mean through less restric-
tion on contacts, in possible
erosion of Communist authority
in the bloc and perhaps even in
the Soviet Union itself. A peace
within bounds would be better -
one that could bring some of the
economic benefits without dan-
ger of political cost.

Russia’s Hopes

Moscow hammers on the
theme of needed results from
the preliminary meeting in Hel-
sinki. The Russians want it to
produce, this year, a full-dress
all-Europe security conference,
on their terms. That is, they
refuse to make any concessions
that would involve free ex-
changes of people, information
and ideas across ideological
boundaries. They make it seem
that what they really want is a
neutralized Europe resigned to a
dominating continental influ-
ence implied by the military
might of its Soviet neighbor.
They are in a hurry, too, be'
cause they do not relish possible
developments in Western Europe
centering about an expanded
Common Market whose econo—
mic muscle, already consider-
able, might be complemented
some day by some measure of
polilical integration.
