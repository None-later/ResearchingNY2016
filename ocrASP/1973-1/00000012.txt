Associated Press Writer
LOS ANGELES’ AP -' The
government prosecutor in the
Pentagon papers trial told the
jury that he will avoid any men-
tion of the Vietnam war during
the trial, calling it “irrelevant to
the charges."

As he spoke, some 20 Vietnam
Veterans Against the War
watched from front rows of the
spectator section. They had been
accompanied to court by mem-
bers of the defense team.

Defendants Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo have said they
released top-secret documents
on the war in an effort to end
the conflict. They call the war
the key issue in the trial.

But Asst. U.S. Atty. David
Nissan, in his opening argument,
said, “The government case will
not present matters irrelevant to
the charges. We will present no
evidence — no witnesses - no

documents to litigate the war.
There will be no witness called
to say whether the war should
have begun. . ."

Promising jurors a “calm, un-
emotional presentation of the
facts," he said: “There will be
no appeals to the passions and
prejudices of anyone."

He then listed the subjects the
government would not mention.

Nissen said he would not dis-
cuss whether the government has
withheld information on the
war. “Such matters are irrele-
vant," he said. “The charges in
this case do not deal with
making information available to
the public."

Ellsberg, 41, and Russo, 35,
are charged with espionage con-
spiracy and theft in connection
with the leak to news media in

1971 of top-secret papers detail-
ing origins of U.S. involvement
in the Vietnam war.

Nissen said the government

case would make no mention of
the newspaper publication of the
documents, no evidence on
whether other persons have
violated secrecy laws just as
Ellsberg and Russo did and no
evidence on whether the defend-
ants “felt justified or not."

“The defendants' motives will
not be discussed in our evi-
dence," said Nissen. "Motives do
not excuse behavior.”

The defense has contended
in pretrial arguments that a key
point of the expionagc law is the
requirement of intent to harm
the government of the United
States. Nissen has claimed the
government need not prove such
intent.

However, US. District Court
Judge Matt Byrne, in a speech
from the bench to attorneys
Tuesday, said the “congressional
purpose" of espionagr laws was
to protect certain information
“in prevention of injury to the

nation."

Everyone knows what happen-
ed at the Capitol District Tour-
nament, right? High~_flying, big-
time Siena came rolling into the
annual tourney at a perfect 5-0,
steamrolled over Albany, won
the championship, and left 7-0.
Meanwhile, the Great Danes, de-
moralized after losing to Hart-
wick, Binghamton, and Siena,
were never the same. It sounds
good on paper, but someone
forgot to tell Doc Sauers and his
boys how the story was sup-
posed to go.

All the elements were there.
The Danes had suffered back to
back losses to two teams they
beat last year. And Lord knows
how powarful Siena was. They
had knocked off Seton Hall, did
have an unblemished record, and
boy did the media blow them
up! Outlandish prEdictions of
the Albany encounter were
mixed with personal remarks as
the Tourney approached. Emo-
tions were peaking 'qn both
sides.

How did Sauers feel? “We had
a long talk on the' bus after the
Binghamton loss. the team work-
ed hard in nractice; They had
basically the same attitude to»
wards Siena as in the past. I knew
if we played a good game we
could win. And we did."

Doc ‘Sauers Works

Christmas Magic

Call it Christmas magic or any-
thing else, but when the Capitol
District Tournament comes by
at the end of December, the
Albany Danes play their kind of
ball. The game started poorly.
The Danes fell behind early
20-10, as Siena bombed Al-
bany's zone press. Sauers switch-
ed to man-to-man and the lead
was cut to three at the half. The
big reason was Quattrocchi, who
won the Tourney MVP, and Bob
Rossi, who canned 12 in the first
half.

. The second stanza was great -
if viewed from the Albany per-
spective. Reggie Smith got super
hot, hitting five in a row in one
streak, and finishing with 23.
Troch played outstanding ball at
both ends, clicking for 25. At
one point, the Danes led 75-56
but cooled off to take a 81-71.
victory. The big factors were
Albany's good rebounding and
top conditioning, as Siena look»
ed ragged towards the end. The
victory was for Coach Suucrs,
"one of the most satisfying wins
of my career since I‘ve been at
Albany,"

The next night was Union with
that big Championship trophy
on the line. The Dani-s raced to ii
thirir-r-n point lead in the first
half and then got hit hard With

The Albany wrestlers return to

matmen take on Amherst on the

Vafter splitting their first two

After finishing third in the
quadrangle meet, the Albany
team took on Williams. Pins by
Walt Katz and Larry Mims, along
with fine performances by Jeff
Albrecht and Rudy Vido, and
also helped along by two for

defeat the visitors.

One week later the Danes met

fouls helped put Troch, Reggie,
and Byron Miller in trouble, and
forced Doc to go to his bench.
Harry Johnson responded with 8
points and 6 rebounds to help
maintain a 31-22 edge at the
half.

Then the fouls took their toll:
Smith fouled out, and Troch and
Byron each picked up four. With
three Danes on the bench, Union
bounced back in the second half
and seemed destined to win
when they got possession with
19 seconds left and the game
tied. But a hurried Union shot
was wide and the game went
into overtime. Albany went
wild, especially Mr. Miller on the
boards, and the Great Danes
won by five. Bob Curtiss and
Dave Welchons each did a job on
defense. However, ll Was a lypl'
cal Albany win everybody

So the Danes repeated as Cap-
itol. District Champs, went on to
Whip Hamilton 95-58, and nip

regained their momentum and
their ill center, Werner Kolln

Pups HOpe for
.500 Year

by Nathan Salanl

Cautious optimism is how
Coach Lewis described his oul-
look for the remainder of the
Danes JV basketball season, and
with good reason. Definite im-
provement in its last two games,
high moral, great attitude, and
the addition of three new play-
ers should all help the team gel
aan put on a better post-
vacritioii performance.

The caution over optimism is
in there for a few reasons, the
mosl important of which is the
27 diiy layoff the players have
had since their last game. The
question is whether the team
will be able to resume where
they left off before the vacation.
and have the players remained in
shape? Fortunately, the team
will play Schenectady Com-
munity College this Saturday be-
fore playing SUNY rival
()ncontzi next Week.

Naturally Illjlll‘ll'h could be a
negative factor, should they
appear, as Will the quality of [In-
opponents' play. According lo
Coach livwm, “No team should
blow us off the court. l'vr- scout-
ed all of our opponents. All are
good clubs, but none are super
ll‘ilmh. We'll just have to play
them one game at a lime."

 
   
  
    
   
   
 
   
 
  
  
   
 

    
    
   
  

  
 
   

 

Coach Lewis is “naturally aim-
ing for a 14-4 season" (the team
is now 1-4), and believes "that a
.500+ season is certainly poss-
ible. We should get a pretty good
idea of how things will turn oul
after our next two games, versus
Sch. C.C. and then Oneonta
State."

In the near future, the team
will be taking on severai
traditional rivals, including
Siena, Union, and R,P.l. Siena
and Union are doing well, and
R.l’,l. beat us by 10 last time, so
this should be interesting. Hope-
fully, the addition of Harold
Merritt (6'4" center), Rich Kap-
ner (6'2" forward), and Ron
Edwards (5‘9" guard) will pro»
vide the needed depth that a
good team must have.

Hopefully. the team will blos-
sum in the upcoming g’dmﬂS. arid.
Willi a Iiltle luck and your in-
creased support, the Pups may
