ones Rally To Extend Streak

by Bruce Maggin

Clutch. That’s the word to
describe the Albany State Great
Dane basketball team. Just when
it looked like the Danes might
lose their first home game in
twoyems, the Cagera got their
second wind and poured it on to
down Marist College 71-57 Wed-
nesday night. thus extending
their streak to 22.

There were two old faithfuls
and one budding star that
powered the Danes to victory.
John Quattrocchi proved once
again that he is the most impor-
tant link to the team, Without
Troch in the lineup, Albany
squandered a ten point lead and
suddenly found itself losing.
That‘s when Bryon Miller along
with the ever improving Harry
Johnson and John Quattrocchi
hit for ten unanswered points to
put a close game into an easy
victory.

A big game by Jonson was
quite important since I'owards
Reggie Smith and Werner Kolln
were both hurting. Smith did sec
parttime duty but he was not
the same spark plug on offense
and defense.

Marist put itself out of the

game with its attrocious foul
shooting. The Red Foxes only
made 7 for 22 at the charity
stripe.

Both teams came out shooting
quite well in the opening half as
the teams stayed close. Marist
shot a hot 55% from the ﬁeld.
The lead changed hands 11 times
but the Danes were able to inch
away. Sparked by Johnson's
three straight baskets just before
half time, Albany was able to
take a nine point lead into the
lockerroom. Johnson at one
point brought the crowd to its
feet with an exciting backhand
layup.

It looked like the subs would
get some early playing time in
the second half as the Danes
stretched their lead to -lSu‘lS and
showed no signs of letting up. At
this point, Quattrocchi was
taken out for a rest and Marist
started to click. Led by Mike
Hart, Marist hit for nine straight
points. Troch was quickly inser-
ted into the game but Marist was
able to gain ti slim one point
lead, Then the Danes started
playing their kind of bulb tough
defense and the offense started
to roll. Albany was particularly
tough under the hoards. The

siun were not enough to push
the Albany State swimmers past
Union College last Wednes-
day. ’IheGreatDarier/immerswere

Danes didn’t let up. They took a

52-51 deficit and turned it into a
71-55 advantage when Doc
Sauers ﬁnally emptied the bench
with a minute remaining. In that
16-4 spurt. Marist failed to score
a field goal. Marist did hit for a
basket in the closing seconds but
it hardly mattered to the Danes
as they had their seventh victory

behind right from the very start
of the meet and a late rally fell
short.

Thr- loss was especially painful
for the Albany swimmers who
had won their season's opener.

Thc small pond which is located in the wooded area in the
