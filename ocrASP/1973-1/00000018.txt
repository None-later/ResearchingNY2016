Jazz is with us again, not that
it ever really left us...but you
didn't need this writer to tell
you that. Rock isn't exactly
dead--there are still several ex-
ceptional groups and a few out-
standing individuals mining the
genre--but it isn't exactly alive,
either. Once you get past the
Dead, Yes, the Allmans, and (fill
in your next two or three
favorites), there isn't that much
going on, and a good deal of the
second and third level stuff is
intolerably stupid. And so, jazz
again...wry, wise. and bitter-

‘sweet, augmented by technology

and tempered by the street.
Herewitht, some recent offerings:

The New Heavenly Blue
(Atlantic SD 7247) isn't really
jazz. and it isn't really any good.
The six musicians are well-

"Hew Heavenly

schooled and obviously compe-
tent on assorted guitars, basses,
keyboards, percussion instru-
ments, violins, trumpets, trom-
bones, and whatnots (wooden
cooking spoons?) but they’re
sorely lacking in inspiration. The
compositions are “cute” (that is,
resplendent with all kinds of
weird time signatures, bizarre
arrangements, etc.) but devoid
of content, and the singing is
rock and roll caterwauling at it's
worst. I’m reviewing this pot-
pourri only because NHB is led
by Dave Brubeck‘s son Chris,
and so has received a great deal
of totally unwarranted at-
tention. Avoid this overblown

jazz. A brilliant soloist and an

Bottle Hill Sparkles

The best bluegrass band from New Jersey graced the Ballroom last
Saturday nite for the third time in a year; Bottle llill could probably

show up once a month for three

years and still be eagerly welcomed.

If you haven‘t heard the band in at least one of their countless
performances in this area during thc past year you don't know what
you‘ve missed; they're loads of fun and killer musicians besides.
They turned in their usual fine set;Mitterboff looning around while

he played the best mandolin
delivering strong, honey-Southern ft

in the Northeast, Walt Michaets
avorcd vocals and delighting us

with his hammered dulcimer, and the others ﬁlling in capably. Just
one complaint-vthey shouldn't bother trying to spread the vocal
leads around; Walt is too good a singer to share thc starring role with
the others. The harmonies Were just fine, though.

Best of all, Bottle Hill came on first, so that wc didn‘t have to sit
through a full set by Country Granola first. (LU. would like to
follow in Commander Cody’s footsteps, but to do that they'll have
to find better musicians and less derivative material. Country
Granola might have come across better in a bar (ic, if the listener
could drink); perhaps Concert Board might consider allowing liccr
(at the least) in the Ballroom for such shoWs?

Lack Of Depth Hampers Swimmers

by Steve Katz

Albany Swim Coach, Brian
Kelly, did not have to look far
for people to praise in last
Saturday's meet against Stony
Brook. Great individual perform-

ances abounded as the Great
Danes took 8 firsts of the 13
event meet. By the end (if the
meet, however, Stony Brook had
outmanned Albany for a 62-51
victory.

Newcomers Star In

by Nathan Salaam

The Pups opened up their post-
-vncalion play on the right foot
This past Saturday night,
defeating visiting Schenectady
Community College by a score
at" 71-46. The Pups came from
behind very early in the first
half, and were never header],
thanks to strong performances
by Harold Merritt, Jose Alicea,
and Rich Kapncr.

The game opened with Albany
winning the jump, and missing
its first shot. Schenectady
followed suit when they took
control, and so the ball bounced,
back and forth, with neither
team scoring. The Pups looked
stale, and probably felt even
worse when Jim O’Brien sunk
the first of 3 straight baskets for
the visitors after 4 minutes had
elapsed.

Suddenly, the Pups came alive,
and led by Merritt, put 4 straight
through the hoop, to grab an 843

The l’ups went ahead 12-10 via
a drivmg, unrlcrliand layup by

Alicea which ignited a five
minute scoring sprcc for llll'
Pups, which saw Schenectady

Ryn pulled Albany close with a
victory in the 500 yd. freestyle.
In a situation reminiscent of last
week's contest at Union, Albany
was now in a situation to forge
ahead with victories in the 200
yd. breaststroke and the option-
al diving.

It was not to be however.
Albany fared no better in these
events this week than they did
last Week. Two successive losses
in the breaststroke and the op-
tional diving put the meet out of
the reach of the Albany
swimmers. Another Albany vic-
tory in the 400 yd. relay did
lime to affect the ﬁnal score of
62—5]. -

The first three meets of the
swim season have made it clear
that Albany has the individual
swimmers to keep up with any
school in the SUNYAC.
