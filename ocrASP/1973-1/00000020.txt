OTTAWA AP — The Canadian government has
received invitations from each of the four com-
batants to take part in a cease-fire obwerver force in
Vietnam, the external affairs department announced
Thursday.

The invitations from Washington, Hanoi, Saigon
and the Viet Cong satisfy one of two conditions
External Affairs Minister Mitchell Sharp has placed
on Canadian participation in the observer force for

r an initial 60 days.

The other condition remaining is the signing by all
four combatants of the peace agreements. That is
expected to take place Saturday.

Meanwhile, the defense department said 153
Canadian forces personnel are assembling in Mon-
treal. ready to be flown to Vietnam as soon as the
cabinet approves Canadian participation formally.
The total number of Canadians expected to be sent
is 290.

They will not be an armed force.

SAIGON AP — A surge of enemy action during
the countdown for a cease-fire has killed dozens of
South Vietnamese soldiers and one American and
damaged an American warship,

Twenty-two Viet Cong rockets blasted the Bien
llori Air Base near Saigon, killing the American and
wounding two others shortly before dawn Friday.

Bloodmobile Desires Donations

by Karen Klevanosky

Attention, everyone! Yes.
everyone! As long as you weigh
over 110 pounds, are reasonably
healthy. with no history of hepa-
titis, malaria or heart failure, and
haven’t been on antibiotics for
the past two weeks, there's a
good chance you can donate
blood. The Red Cross Blood-
mobile will accept your dena-
tion of a pint of blood on
Tuesday, February 6 from 10
a.m. to 4 FM. in the Campus
Center Ballroom.

Donating blood is quick and
simple. After a brief interview
and tests for weight, tempera-
ture, blood pressure, and hemo-
globin, one pint is taken. Since
the average adult has 10 to 12
pints of blood, you'll hardly
miss it! The actual donation
takes less than IO minutes. A
short rest and snack follows. The
entire visit takes less than an
hour. And if you come in the
morning .iiidtor call t57~721tt
for an appointment, you won't
haVe to wait.

The need for donor blood has
become increasingly acute in
recent months. Blood collected
from volunteer donors is the
safest (speeitii'allv. there is .i

by Glenn von Nostitz

Psychology Professor Caroline
Waterman's tenure prospects
never appeared particularly fav-
orable.

So we were rather surprised at
an unusual turn of events in her
dragged-out controversy. It came
directly before the intersession
recess in the form of a positive
recommendation from Melvin K.
Bers, Associate Dean for Behav-
ioral and Social Sciences. In it
memorandum labeled, “Action
by Associate Dean," Bers clearly
sided with Dr. Waterman, saying
that she should receive both
tenure and promotion.

This latest development came
on the heels of a negative recom‘
mendation by Psychology De-
partment Chairman Robert
Teevan, along with a depart-
mental vot.e against the be-
leagurcd Assi. ant Professor.

Bers‘ memorandum, copies of
which Were given to Dr, Water-
man and I. Moyer Hunsberger,
Dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences, was chock full of com-
pliments she sorely needs in her
file if she hopes to teach here
next year. Bers said that he has
seen “impressivo evidenCe of her
excellence as an instructor" and
that “the, record identifies Di'.
Waterman as a dedicated teacher
of outstanding capabilities."

The thrust of the Bers state-
ment was that Waterman is
strongest in undergraduate
teaching, the evidence primarily
being student testin‘ionials to
that effect.

He also touched on the other
four traditional evaluative cri-
teria, including her “substantial
ability as a scholar" and her
“continuing energy and drive,"
qualities which Bers maintains

 

are conducive to continued im-
provement.

Throughout the memo the
Associate Dean emphasized un-
dergraduate education as oppos-
ed to graduate programs, point-
ing out that nearly 80% of
SUNYA's students are in the
former category. He disagrees
with Department Chairman
Robert Tecvan’s commitment to
“major attention to our graduate
program," a commitment which
he says should not be pursued
"through the sacrifice of first-
rate performers in the under-
graduate area," Presumably, he
means people like Dr. Waterman.

Prospects Somewhat Improved

With this highly favorable re-
commendation in her hands, as
well as the recently released
Science Citation Index figures
working in her favor, Water
man's prospects for getting ten-
ure seem to have improved
somewhat. But that still isn't
saying much,

She still faces Dean I. Moyer
Hunsberger and his Faculty Per-
sonnel Committee, as well as the
Council on Promotions and Cori-
tinuing Appointments. The case
is expected to haVe its toughest
going under Hunsberger. The
Dean has made some statements
recently which do not bode well
for the junior Psychology Prof
essor.

So a negative recommendation
is expected soon from Iluns~
berger and his committee. It is a
recommendation that will carry
much weight, since llunsberger
has often been considered the
“king-pin" of the tenure
machine.

And Waterman still must live
down the strongly negative letter
of transmittal written by Depart
merit Chairman 'I‘eevan, as Well

as the departmental vote against
giving her promotion and tenure.
In the transmittal letter, Teevan
said Waterman was “below aver-
age" in service above the depart-
mental level, and that her prod-
ucation of articles is “below
average" for a "tenured member
of a good department at the
University level." In a later,
supplementary transmittal letter,
the Chairman quoted "fch facul-
ty members" who said that her
“research reflects little origin-
ality," “trivializatioii” and that
her work is ofsmtill significance.
Personality Produces Problems
But it seems the most difficult
obstacle in Dr. Waterman's path
is personality. According to
Associate Dean Bers, she is “out‘
spoken and actiVe in support of
her views," but she “tends to
produce some discomfort among
those most supportive of
traditional academic conven-
tions." Furthermore, Bers- cited
faculty members who said that
“her behavior is ‘disrtiptive'." It
was concluded by Bers in the
memorandum that Waterman is
a “strongwilled individual"
whose values and beliefs are
sometimes at “considerable
variance" with those “of many
of her senior colleagues."
Personality clashes are not.
however, a generally accvpted
evaluative criteria. Whether a
person is “liked” on a personal
level is not an official evaluative
yardstick, althouin it does seem
to be a very important one
entering this case. Indeed. per-
sonalin may be so important
here that it could very well
decide the final outcome.
Waterman may. indeed, be an
outstanding undergraduate
teacher. an excellent researcher,
and may show great potential

Bers Backs Waterman on Promo, Tenure

for continuing growth. But all of
these factors in her favor seem
to hold little significance in the
face of the personality problem.
The issue of personality seems to
be obscuring those of teaching
and research.

So Hunsbergcr and colleagues
will have to dig deeply if they
are to unearth evidence that can
be used officially to discrt‘dit
Waterman. Personality clashes,
and the “production of discom-
l'oit" are not considered official
evidence. Whether or not Huns-
bei'ger can justify a negative reA
commendation on the basis of
traditional criteria. then, is what
we are waiting to see. The report
of the Faculty Personnel
(‘ommittee should he released
soon.

Supporters Pleased

What seems to be pleasing
Waterman supporters now is not
only the favorable ri-commcridv
atin by Bers, but the fact that
they are not alone: There is

someone in the administrative
ranks who is on their side. Mel-
vin Bers agrees with them that
Waterman is extremely well
qualiﬁed in terms of the tradi-
tional criteria, and he has down-
played the personality issue.

Even if Hunsberger and
committee should decide to ar-
gue personality, claiming that
Waterman is “disruptive” or
“destructive,” he will face some
strong counterarguments.
According to Asso .ate Dean
Bers. “my efforts to obtain evi~
dence that Professor Waterman's
‘disruptiveness‘ is destructive
yielded little" and that "in many
cases the most serious incident
retailed by the faculty member
was embarrassingly trivial."

So it looks as if all the official
evidence is on Caroline Water-
man's side. That, however. does
not mean she will win her case.
Which is a good lesson on the
functioning of a university
bureaucracy.
