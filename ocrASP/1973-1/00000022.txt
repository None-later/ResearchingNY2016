n Giving a Damn

by Pat Curran

"You don't give a damn about
me, do you!

“And you think I feel the same
way about you. when my whole
purpose and goal is to serve you,

"I do my best to make this
campus, this “universin com
munily'a better place,

“Ye! you hate me. You (‘l‘lll
crze mid deniean me. You dis
trust and despise me to (he very
L‘OJ‘L‘, ()I’ l'lsf' yf)“ lg'llﬂ‘l‘ "ll',
because I am who! I am an
organization:Student Associa-
iron."

lf S.A. could talk, perhaps
that's what It would say. Perhaps
it would say, “I'm trying, but I
don't seem to be making many
people happy."

But then, who cares about the
“third ﬂoor clique" of the (2amv
pus Center? Who cares whether
or not those juvenile politicians
on Central Council givo $159.59
to the Protowalling Club, or how
many bills Lampert vetoed this
week? A student pays his or her
$60 mandatory tax, and what
does he/she get from it?

All of this wouldn’t be worth
writing about, or getting iii-
volved in except for the fact that
we'll face the samir thing when
we enter "the outside world."

While some say thiit we need

organization and government to
solve our problems, others point
to government and say, “There
is the problem,"

Let's take a look at Student
Ansocration, assuming we‘ll give
a damn about it for ii few
minutes, at least. What's not
right about the organization?
How many people really get
excited about the student gov-
ernment and the activities it

sponsors? Does anyone respect it
as a representative system which
can make things happen, and
bring about meaningful change?

Take a glance through Friday’s
ASP. The biggest issues currently
seem to be: continued anti-war
actions, federal aid to dissident
students, the Waterman case--
none of which Student Associa-
tion has any direct contact with.
The paper also contains stories
on Wild Wild Weekend activities,
and athletic events, in addition
to numerous advertisements for
groups and happenings which arc
funded by the student assess-
ment.

So what?!? ls S.A., supposedly
the formal organization of the
student body, taking on the
tasks that will effect people's
lives (assuming that the Associa-
tion is basically and potentially ii
good means of doing so)?

Granted, the SUNY Board of
Trustees has cramped student
governmcnui' range of activity
by limiting the use of mandatory
student fees to educational,
social, rind recreational pursuits,
and for the student media. While
loopholes presently may permit
governments to stretch this ’l‘rusA
tccs' resolution to accommodate
“questionable projects, it is
clear to this writer that ii volun-
tary tax is by far the best answer
to these restrictions.

But what then? Suppose S.A.
could extend its interesla. Would
more students becumu oxcitud
about what the Association's do~
ing, or would, in fact, S.A. fold
up because puoplo no longer are
forced to support it financially?

It’s no different in the “real

n

world, is it? Government costs
us morc.than its worth in View
of what we get in return. Poli»
ticiuns are, at best, removed and
unresponsihlc, and at worst,
downright corrupt. The general
mood today is one of uninterest
- "apathy" is the wrong word,
for it implies an obligation of
the individual to ask the govern-
ment what it's up to.

We’re saying, “The less govern-
ment and lsce of each other, the
better."

In ii ‘commuiiity" of our r.
tively small size, especially an
educational community, we
should be much less willing to
accept anything short of an ideal
way of life. If the government
(student government, anyway)
isn't what it ought to bc, don't
accept it! Rebuild or bury the
thing! If representatives artI
neither seen nor heard, dump
‘cm! Demand that they report
and answer for all their actions.
If the system has stagnated, turn
it upside down! Why tolerate the
$60 mandatory activity assess-
ment when you're not satisfied
with the way it's being spent!?!

And what of today, iit this
university? Will representatives
establish the ties with their con
stituents which may restore fiiitli
in students' ability to make
things happen? ()an elected stu~
dent leaders with the support of
the people they represent. gain
the respect of the faculty and
administration? Most impor-
tantly, will b'.A. lJUl'Ulnu truly
the Association of students on
this campus?

llufora we'll get affirmative
answers to these questions, we‘ll
all have to ‘give ii collective
damn.‘

War is Over

As we stand on the threshold oer. Nixon’s “generation
of peace,” let us hope that Our nation has learned the
futility of war. lf we have learned this, then maybe our
ave not died in vain. We have witnessed in the lust

boys h
ten years a s
No one can measure the harm that this war inflicted on in
as a nation, yet it divided us violently, alienating millions
pic by forcing them to choose between C(HlSClL’lltr‘

ready deterioration of our national Character.

()f PCO
and country.

For many of us on this campus, Vietnam has bci-n .iu
much a part of our lives as our education. Who can i‘ril'gi'l
the rnirrchcs, the solidarity, the enthusiasm, thosc Spring
strikes, and anxious waiting while those WC cared irbrrirr
were awarded their lottery numbers. It will be difficuli iril
us to think of .i world iii which bombs don't dcsrrm
hospitals and kill p 'asants working their ricc letltllt‘S.

What happcris now will, of course, dcpcnd on in,irr-.
factors. We leave an ally that is not cquipcd to handh- lllt'
responsibility of self-government. The Thicu govcriinri-ni
has always needed American business, American WL'upiriix.
and American troops. It remains our: of the most corrirpr
governments in the world. We have inVCStcd so much in
lives and money to support ii man who has refused [H
abide by anything that even rcscmblcs democracy. Him:
who have opposcd him in any way rcmain lrrr'kr‘d up in
inhuman cclls, and Mr. 'l'hicu has changed the Sldlll'. rri
political prisoners to those of common criminals so ll(' i.ilr
kci-p lllr‘lll iiiilcd.

We run only liopc now that there will bc no Ilirnir

Victnanis, and no more young men having lrr light [llr'

wars of old bureaucrats and sick gcncrals. We must girnrr
against cvcir the smallest U.S. involvement in thc llllt’iliui
affairs of smaller nations. LL't us join [lit‘ world in pram
instead ofdividing it in war.

In ciilier LilSi‘, the ASP wclcomcs this ;i(l(llll(rii in Iii:
