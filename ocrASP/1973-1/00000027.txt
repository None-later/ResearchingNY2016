Keeping Up
With the Jones

To The Editor: _

As one of the many students
closely involved in the Waterman
case, I have witnessed the admini-
strative blunders aptly described
in Elizabeth Jones' satire of
January 19th. While one can
mock some members of the
bureaucratic machinery, it is easy
to lose sight of the main Issue;
that of Student power. Under-
graduate and graduate students
maintain little voice in promotion
and tenure decisions at Albany
State. Dr. Waterman's case exem-
plifies student impotence in
dealing with the archaic
psychology department.

Sincerely,
Richard Weinbaum

Stalog Colonial

To The Editor:

An old problem has grown to a
fever pitch recently on Colonial
Quad. This is my fourth year on
Colonial and I‘ve had the pleasure
of seeing all types of residence
staff blunders. This “trained” col-
lection of "professionals" has
gone one step farther than this
student can take. In a year of
refrigerator problems, furniture
crack-downs and questionable in-

spection methods, my Quad staff
members have made little, if any,
attempt to air student opinion on
the above problem. Gestapolike
notices preceed all' search and
seizure operations. The food has
reached an all time low and still
Dr. Fischer. head of residence on
campus, can't understand why
students are moving off campus in
increasing numbers.

Such ignorance from above
seeps down through the residence
staff bureaucracy and the ones to
get stepped on are the misery-r
paying tenants of the state, the
students. Rumor is the law of the
Quad as students hide or remove
“staff designated contraband" to
a plac‘e where staff can't find it
and thus impose removal charges.

For four years, honest attempts
at hearing student grievances have
been lacking. This is my last
semester here but I would like to
recommend all campus residents
to consider off-campus housing
for next year. Save money and
grief.

StOp Pretending We're Democratic

(Ital

Straight talk from Senators is
as rare as winter flowers. No
matter what's coming down,
they always seem to be telling us
that everything will be alright,
thanks to our superior system—a
system that sends them off to
plush, paneled offices and sleek
Washington suburbs.

Veteran Arkansas Democrat
William Fulbright, however, has
been unusually frank about the
impotence of a tractable Con-
gress, and the steady drift
toward an authoritarian state.

The Senator's‘observations on
growing presidential power and
the fragile nature of democracy
are often tinged with resignation
these days--a resignation born of
twenty~ﬁve liberal years on the
Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, struggling with the in-
exorable rise of militarism
through the era of the Cold War
and Vietnam.

The Senate has deteriorated to
where nobody listens to any
debate", said Fulbright in a re-
cent interview with the Pacifica
Radio network. "It's dominated
at the moment by the administ-
ration and the military. They
win all the votes. It is the rarest
thing to have a dialogue or a
debate on the floor of the
Senate, as we did in the old
days. You see, they have a new
system of setting down the vote
under unanimous consent; and
when the vote is sci. Illl'll every-
body cli-zirs out and you can't
find 'cm, czin't gL-t 'i-m on the
floor

“This has dcvclopcd into n
syslcm which, in my opinion,
has undermined any ri-al signifi-
i'iiitci- of the Scnntc...l think it
used to play an important part
in our government, but I think
its [Iill‘l now is simply as an cclio
of thc Pentagon and llll‘ White
House,

“'I‘his has bccii :i ll‘l‘ll'l for thc
lasl, twcnly-fivc
World War II... In wartime or in
criscs, when you'rc concerned
with war, you tcnd to delegate
your powcr to the I’rcsidcnt.
This has always happcncd in past
wars... When the President
was...in the Senate, nobody
thought ho was Illfilllll)lt‘ He was

just another Sciiator Ilc mchs
sixti-cii blocks and then you
treat hnn as il' be has this private
pipeline to (loll ()l' course,
that's the way ll usi-il to ho in
incdii-vnl times. Wc'ri- Just not
very far from thi- l)lVllll‘ Right
of Kings of (Iliarlcs the First.
Aftcr all, that's in our history.
'I'hcrc's just. a Vcry slight patina
of civilization lictwci-n than and

yciii's, since

now, and it’s very easy to revert
to it."

For all its occasional huffing
and puffing, Fulbright doesn’t
see the prs establishment as a
particularly dependable ally
against the authoritarian trend
either.

“Many of the press,“ he noted,
“have acquired television sta-
tions which makes them subject
to the FCC which is subject to
the President, and therefore.
they are in the position to be
intimidated through that. I
mean, some of these big papers,
they don't want to lose a station
that‘s worth ﬁfty million dollars.
So they tend to say, ‘Well maybe
we better not go too far, and
maybe we won't give over-
-exposure to any criticism of the
White House.‘

“...It reminds me a little of
Louis the Fourteenth-the defe-
rence that everybody gives to
the leader in the White House,
and I think this is almost inevi-
table in a big country. Small
countries. where there's a sense
of community and people know

one another, have succeeded in
preserving a high degree of dem-
ocracy; I mean people like Nor-
way and Sweden and Denmark
and Holland...But when you get
above that, you look at China,
Russia, ourselves...

'The Senator’s resonant voice
trails off, mumbling other com-
parisons, thinking perhaps of
Oceania, Eurasia. He seems like a
tired, old dove in a hawk’s sky,
willing to accept what his
experience tells him is probably
inevitable

“Whether we can pull it out
and preserve some degree of
democracy remains to be seen. I
hope we can, but if we can‘t
we’ll be no worse off than other
people. We’ll simply develop a

different system, and maybe in a 100
years we‘ll quit pretending we're

a democracy and admit that
we’re an oligarchy or plutocracy,
which it seems to be.“

“It’ll be a long time after the
change has taken place that any-
body will admit it,” the Senator
concluded. “We always pretend
that it’s something else; as we do
today."

, "Big Daddy

by Robert A. Dobkin
AP Military Writer

WASHINGTON AP - “Hey. big daddy," says a
Pentagon pamphlet for returning prisoners of war,
“when your young son or daughter comes to you
ﬁnd sny5_ ‘Do you dig?’ you can say, ‘iny it on me

nu

dude, and right on.

The pamphlet. is ii dictionary of slang expressions
m help POWs -— some of whom haven't been home
in eight, years —‘ understand the language of today's

youth.

The head of a household, advises the pamphlet, is
“big daddy," Being high on either drugs or alcohol
is “blasted,” while to focus attention on something

is to “tune in."

“This is a part of the language and the slung being
your sons and

used by the youth of today *-
dsughters," says the pamphlet.

The POWs also can be expected to bc unawarc
that Americans ﬁrst. landed on the moon July 20,
1960; that Richard Nixon was elected in 1968 and Fm;
rc-elected in 1972, or that “U.S. infantry troops a. A.
entered the South Vietnamese village of Song My, nuns
My Lai in March 1968 and murdered 450 civilians.“

Summaries such as the latter are includctl in thc

" Is Coming Home

pamphlet to bring the prisoners up to date on major
events, sports highlights and deaths of prominent
individuals since 1965,

The pamphlcts will be handed out to the POWs as
they arrive at Clark Field in the Phillipinos, first

stop on the way home.

A Pentagon spokesman said the news summary is
.. r i .

not mandatory rcading' and In “no way intends to
manage the ncws."

“Some of thcsc guys are going to be out of touch

 

with current events and recent history and this is
Just another way to bring thcm up to date," the
spokesman said.

’I‘hc summary was prcparcd by NBC newsman
Pcli-r Iinckcs and Gordon Hart of Oklahoma State
UiiivvrSity, Navy reservists who wrotc it during
summer training.

Other synopscs cover such cvcnts as thc Kent
State shootings,

the Sharon 'I‘iitc murdcrs, the Joe

icr-Muhammcd Ali prizefight, the attempted
' ation of Gov (icorgc Wallace, Marilyn Mon-
dciith, thc |972 prcsidcntiai racc and, finally,
prcsidcntiril adviscr Ill'llry Kissingcr's succcssful
iicgotiations to curl llic war.
