by John Jekabson

Altematiye Features Service

Jacquelyn (‘hagnon is a young
woman who fervently wants to
lose her job. She has dedicated
herself to telling Americans
about the people of Vietnam
until the war ends. For over a
year she has been traveling
throughout the country with
The Indochina Mobile Educa-
rional Project (Box 39013.
Wash. DC. zoom). to shopping
malls. cottnty fairs. churches.
and college campuses.

"It‘s atria/.ing after all these
years how Americans know so
little about the Vietnamese as

people. about the kind of lives
they lead, their family struc-
tures. or their culture," Jacque-
lyn says. “We‘re so used to
seeing them merely as body-
coitnt statistics on the news."
To show the ordinary life of
Vietnam, the traveling exhibit
has photographs. not of atroci»
ties but of a farmer with his
water buffalo plowing the rice
ﬁelds or of a young boy eating
the fruit of a harvest. The
photos are purposefully low-key.
for the idea of the exhibit isn‘t
to instill guilt in Americans.
Films. music, poetry, and even
food from Vietnam are ollier

aspects ofthe exhibit.
Jacquelyn spent two years in
Vietnam, first Working for the
Catholic Relief Service. and then
with the International Volunteer
Service (NS). The lVS was
kicked out by the Thieu regime
in 197l for its support of the
student peace movement in Sat-
gon. When Jacquelyn returned
to the U.S., she and another
fortner lVS worker, Don Luce,
organized the Exhibit to show
Americans the character of the
people they had known in Viet-
nam, (Luce is the reporter who
uncovered the infamous Tiger
(‘ages at (‘on Sort used by the

government of South Vietnam
to imprison political opponents.)

The mobile exhibit spends lit-
tle time in the anti-war centers
of the U.S.. concentrating in-
stead on the heartland of middle
America -- such places as lowa.
Alabama. Georgia. and Florida.
“We‘ve had little hassle."
Jacquelyn says. “but whenever
local politicians try to block us.
as in Augusta, Georgia or St.
Louis, the publicity attracts
larger crowds."

A collection of Vietnamese
poetry that Jacquelyn helped
translate and edit is an impor-
‘ant part of the exhibit. Many of

the poets in the book have long
since disappeared into the dim-
goons of the Tltieu dictatorship.
Some are probably dead. The
collection includes poems sniirg-
gled oirt of the Tiger (‘ages to
Don Luce.

“Poetry is a very important
part of Vietnamese life.“ Jacque-
lyn says. “Their culture is best
understood by their poems. It
isn’t a poetry of a literary set.
but of the people. Peasants who
cannot read or write compose
poems irt their heads. memoriz-
ing lines by rote, But today most
poems of peace are banned. as
are alt those by Hi) (‘lii Minlr."

Jacquelyn learned to write
poetry herself while in Vietnam.
"We've been taught to hide our
emotions arid feelings." she says
“The Vietnamese don't do that.
Poetry forces you to reveal yoiir~
self. what you stand tor and

what you stand against."

mocks Ahead

by Nathan Salnnt
to the AP. release

According
on Wednesday, January 25,
National League President Chub

Feeney said that the  club
owners do not consider the
designated pinch hitter rule re-
cently adopted by the American
League a good one. He believes
that the rule may detract from
Ian appeal. Feeney says that
is all right when ad-

change

visable, but that the N.L. does
not believe in change for its own
sake.

The rule, recently adopted by
the A.L.. is basically as follows:
A team has the option to desig-
nate one player as the player
who will bat for any pitcher in
that game. This designated pinch
hitter must be listed on the
lineup card prior to the game as
the DPH.

[believe that Mr. Feenrry is a
perfect example of the conservrr
rive morons who have prevvntml
baseball from taking any major
steps to improve the game since
190]. when the foul ball as
strike three was dropped as a
rule. In fact, it would appear
