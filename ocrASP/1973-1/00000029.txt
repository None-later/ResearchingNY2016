this reporter spoke to sturlents
and to bookstore employees.
The lines were shorter airil every~

whole situation than they did in

Why has Mr Colon‘s "moir-
ster" of last semester suddenly
grown benevolent? "Fewer
books." replied Mr. (.‘olon.
adding that I“rry-over courses

both semesters. He also cited the
t.hrr-e~book-pr-r-eourse limit
which the Bookstore has placed
upon the faculty. Airy books
over the original three will only
be ciirried later in the seawater:

(lolon credited the faculty
with “closer cooperation in
giving us accurate class enroll~
merits." An inaccurate enroll-
inr-iit l'igurr- results in (NW or
