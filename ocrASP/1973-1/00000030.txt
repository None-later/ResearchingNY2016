BELFAST AP Roman
Catholic guerrillas hurled gaso-
line bombs and fired more than
800 rounds of ammunition in
numerous clashes with British
troops during the night in
Belfast.

Two soldiers were slightly
wounded, and the British Army
claimed to have wounded eight
gunmen. But only one was cap-
tured and hospitalized.

Explosions wrecked a pub in
Enniskillen and damaged a tele-
phone exchange in Ballyroniin.

The Albany area, if not
bubbling over with actual U.F.O.
activity, is certainly having a
surge of concern and fascination
about these well known‘Uniden-
tified Flying Objects’. Perhaps
finally coming into a time of
their own, these phenomena are
now more openly discussed and
a bit more seriously considered.

So just what avenues are open
to people intrigued by U.F.O.'s?
Well, for those whose interest in
the subject travels along the
intellectual linw, there is a
course in the philosophy depart-
ment, Phi 440 - Disputed
Borders of Science, that just
might meet the requirement. Or,

clear the study of U.F.O.’s has
become more widespread after
decades of disbelief and

negation.
‘Disputed Borders of Science’,
taught by Dr. Robert F.

Creegan, is an experimental
course designed to explore the
many aspects of U.F.0. theory,
philosophy, reality; to comment
on the sightings and reportings
of the phenomena; and to dis-
cuss the psychological and socio-
logical significance and implica-
tions of them.

Professor Creegan, who has
interviewed experts
internationally, points out the
secrecy surrounding
governmental involvement of the
subject, especially in the case of
the United States. Perhaps to

Ill-'0 3 Cause local Concern

compared to the supposed 2%.

One factor that keeps popping
up in any discussion of U.F.O.'s
is the societal lack of acceptance
of the subject as a legitimate
field of study. David Moise, who
is associated with ASGAP,
explained the reticence of his
colleagues to divulge their afﬁlia-
tion with the group for fear of
public reaction.

The Albany Study Group of
Aerial Phenomena is a small
(under 20 people) loosely-knit
group who take the observing of
U.F.O.'s as serious scientific
investigation. Generally spurred
by curiosity and, as Mr. Moise
puts it, puzzled by anything
unanswered by scienCe, the
members work alone or in small
groups following up sightings,

if curiosity has gotten the better stave off public

Last Thursday evening, the (Iciitral Council met in
room 375 of the Campus Center, as they are
accustomed to doing every week of the school year.
Next week, however, the meeting will be held in the
Indian Quad cafeteria at 7:30 p.m.

This was due to a motion offered by Vice-(.Iliair-
man l’at Curran. In an attempt to bring the Council
closer to the students, meeting will be rotated on
the various residential quads.

Council President Ken Stoke-m reported that more
pressure is needed to haVe the Univr-rsity Senate

system that would place all uiiivcristy personnel,
faculty, commuter and residents on an equal stand
ing.

Furthermore, the Council requested that. President
Bericzet and the University Senate suspend all
classes on the Monday after Easter Sunday (April
113i) iii order to allow all students ample time to
return to school after the holidays.

After sortie debate, the members overturned two
vetoes from Student Association President Michael

Secondly, it granted a $125 stipend to lllt' Financi-

Committee Chairman who spends close to thirty
hours a week in his duties.

Following an explanation and discussion of vari
otts pulling procedures, the Council decided on
utilizing a zero base poll for the Finance (Tommit
Lee's upcoming student opinion survvy. The poll will
ask how the student tax money should be used in
the future without regard to what is currently
funded

Towards the end of the meeting a bill introduced
by Barry DaVIs and amended by Eric Loiischcin
officially terminated the publication Iv‘u/l CIH'Ir'
(formerly known as Sweet Fire) and requested that
the Student Association llag be flown at half mast
