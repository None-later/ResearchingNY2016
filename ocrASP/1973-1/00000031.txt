Nuclear Blackmail

(ZNS) What are the chances of
a group of terrorists obtaining
nuclear materials and using
atomic bombs for blackmail?

Former Defense Department
researcher Lowell Printe warns
that such a possibility is be-

coming more likely each day.‘

Ponte states that the precautions
presently being taken to safe-
guard nuclear materials -- par-
ticularly Plutonium -- are ex-
tremely lax. He says that under
the present circumstances. it's
only a matter of time before
terrorists or extortionists are
able to steal or build their own
nuclear devices.

PIHIII‘ cites calculations made
by Here/rec magazine. Science
estimates that. by the ymr 2000,
70 percent of the electrical pow-
er in the U.S. will be supplied by
“I’astrllreeder” nuclear reactors.
Fast breeder reaCturs have one
quality that the present-day
steam nuclear reactors don't

According to the Atomic En-
ergy Commission, each year one
to two percent of» this surplus
plutonium disappears in process-
ing or is “unaccounted for."
Thus, there is no way to know
when a small amount of Plu-
tonium has been stolen. What
just a one-percent loss of Plu-
tonium would mean in the hands
of terrorists is almost mind-
boggling. One-percent of the plu-
tonium expected to be produced
by fast-breeder reactors in the
year 2000 would be enough to
manufacture 1500 atomic
bombs the size of the Hiroshima
weapon.

What would happen if just 1'
few pounds of Plutonium fell
into the wrong hands? Well.
l’onte actually wrote up a series
of scenarios for the Defer'se De-
partment about this. One
possibility is that terrorists could
hold New York City for ransom
for $10 billion. If the U.S. gov-
ernment refused to pay. the
lilackmailers would simply load

Rock Music Cease Fire Breaks Down

BOMBING CONTINUES

South Vietnamese warplanes
flew bombing missions in
support of the ground troops,
but the number of sorties was
not disclosed. Some of the
planes, along with tanks and
armored personnel carriers,
pounded Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese troops in treeline
hideouts along a highway near
Trang Bang, 30 miles from
Saigon.

The foreign ministries of
North Vietnam and the Viet
Cong’s Provisional Revolu-
tionary Government in South
Vietnam charged that the United
States and the Saigon govern-
ment have violated the peace
agreement.

IMPASSE EXPECTED

The cease-fire observers were
to he in the field by Tuesday.
but their departure from Saigon
was believed sure to be delayed
by the impasse on the Joint
Military Commission.

Ambassador Michel Gauvin.
head of the Canadian delegation,
said the international super-
visory body cannot move unless
the Joint military Commission
provides transportation, security
and guidance.

In the two days before the
cease-fire, four U.S. servicemen
were killed, four missing, and 19
wounded. An American soldier.
WO Anthony Dal Pozzo, 22. of
Santa Barbara, California, died
Monday of wounds suffered
Sunday, the first U.S. fatality
since the truce went into effect.

WITHDRAWAL GOES ON

The U.S. Command announced
the withdrawal of another 400
troops from Vietnam, the
second contingent of 400 merit
to leave since the cease- fire
began. This dropped U.S. troop
strength to below 23,000. Under
terms of the agreement, all
American troops must be out of
Vietnam by March 28.

In Phnom Penh, the Cam-
bodian high command reported
five clashes with enemy forces
on the day Cambodian forces
were to stop offensive military
operations to test Communist
intentions. A U.S. spokesman
said U.S. Air Force planes based
in Thailand suspended their
Cambodian operations Sunday
in line with the testing policy.

In Laos, military sources in
Vientiane said there were no
significant offensives to snatch
additional territory before the
cease-fire expected soon. But
they added that fighting in-
