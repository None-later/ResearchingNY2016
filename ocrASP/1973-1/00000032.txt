Graduate Employment Up

College graduates may no
longer be threatened with the
possibility of unemployment
which has faced them for the
past several years.

According to a recent survey
by the College Placement Coun-
cil, a Pennsylvania— based non-
proﬁt organization, employment
of college graduates increased by
6 percent last year. It is the ﬁrst
time in three years than an
upward trend has been noted.

The employers surveyed re-
ported that 47,600 graduates
were hired as compared to the
45,00 hired the previous year. In
1969-1970 there were 70,000
college graduates hired.

The survey found that the
openings made most available to
graduates were in merchandising,
federal government, public
a c c o u n t i n g ,
banking‘financeAinsurance,
chemicals and drugs, and state
and local government.

The biggest percentage boosts
in hiring activity were in re-
search and consulting n 88 per-
cent, chemicals and drugs -— 52
percent, aerospace -- 43 percent,
public accounting —- 37 percent,
electrical machinery -- 32 per-
cent, building materials and con-
struction -- 27 percent.

Unemployment in the en-
gineering profession, which had
increa ed 3 percent in 1971, has
now declined to less than 2
pen-cut.

Employment prospects for
graduating enginners are getting
brighter, says William M.
Kays,dean of Stanford Univer-
sity's School of Engineering, and
there may be a severe shortage
of engineers by 1976, when de-
mand may double the supply.
'Kays noted that the publicity
given engineering unemployment!
continues to affect enrollments
across the US. To counter the
effects of such publicity, the

under Kays’ direction, has begun

a campaign to attract students to

the profession.

The campaign will investigate
alternate routes into engineering,
which would introduce first year
students into the program with-
out stressing heavy commitment
from the start.

Kays also notes a greater in-
terest among students in envi-
ronmental issues, with the result
that enrollments in civil engin-
eering, which is involved with
many environmental problems,
have held up better than in most
areas.

Kays sense an increased in-
terest among undergraduates in
professional careers. According
to two college placement direc-
tors questioned in the College
Placement Council survey,

seniors this year were more in—
terested in finding employment
than a year ago. This year‘s class
was seen as being more practical
in its job-hunting efforts and
more aware of the reality of the
depressed job market.

Liberal arts students, however,
were said to be generally lacking
in knowledge about the job mar-
ket and the process of becoming
part of it.

Employers today are more
concerned with increased pro
ductivity and efficiency, says J.
Dennis Ryan, placement director
at Carnegie-Mellon University.
They want more of a (lemon-
stration of skills than just a
grade-point performance.

“Employers are finding the
students who are career-oriented
in their extra-curricular activities
become productive much sooner
than students without this
additional experience. And they
seem to have it much better
perspective as far :is their pcr~
soiizil goals," concluded ltyini.

View From the Left

by Robert Mayor

I do not address this letter to
the students who read my article
last Friday and responded to it
favorably. Those people who
understood what I was trying to
say, and who understood that
the death of 46,000 American
boys, the wounding of over
300,000 troops and the count-
less other casualties on all sides,
merits the front page, may
excuse me for “my unwavering
failure to adhere to the precepts
of journalistic professionalism."
To those students who did not
understand it, please allow me to
explain.

PARDON ME

Pardon my sentimentality,
pardon my cliches, pardon my
)mniscience, pardon my vanity;
but don't question the signifi»
cancc of that article. I did not
write it for myself. I did not
write it for those of you who
sympathiscd with Nixon's
“peace with honor." I wrote
that because there are a lot of
people out there who cannot
forget their efforts to stop the
war. When the U.S. destroyed so
much with the same callous
viciousncss that all wars precipi»
tate, then 1 will defend my right
and anyone clses right to
respond to it.

REHASH

I do not want to rehash “senti-
mentality” for fear of injuring
those who save their emotions
and sympathy for singing the
“Star-Spangled Banner" and Vt‘ll'
crating ll‘lt‘lf licro, Richard
Nixon. Nor do I wish to go into
any lengthy justification for the
article appearing on page one

DECAYING FAD

Unlike Mr. Frost, Mr. Scott
Alan Smith at least dignified his
criticism with a verbose,
pompous, and detailed letter
that unfortunately is historically
incorrect. Mr. Smith, or simply
Smith (who is fond of usinglast
names only), referred to the
anti-war movement as a "decay-
ing fad." He mustcertainly have
ignored the outpouring of
decent that culminated with an
inauguration protest that saw
over 100,000 people in
Washington DC. January 20th.

LBJ INNOCENT?

Smith went on to say, “Due to
no fault of his own, Johnson
soon found himself hopelessly
entrenched in a war..." I ask you
honestly, do you for one second
believe LBJ is innocent? Who
the hell do you think gave the
final orders to escalate the war?
It was not his “Harvard graduate
advisers, retained from the
Kennedy Administration." It
was his joint chiefs of staff who
led him. And those who deserted
him did so because they had
enough brains to realize that
following orders was proven 20
years ago to be no excuse for
genocide.

ASININE!

ln closing let me address
myscl f to one of the most
asiuinc statements l have read
in recent days. You referred to

Mawkish

Bob Mayer's front page
“newe” story (editorial) of the
last ASP issue on the ending of
the Vietnam war was just insult-
ing. In case you forgot the ar-
ticle, that piece of mish-mosh
began: “We were children inno-
cently attempting to anwith
a world that was full of things
children didn't understand. Our
elders understood because they
had witnessed the bitterness of
war. Yet our elders were for the
most part silent."

It was typical of the sentimen-
talism that plagues much of the
anti-war literature: mawkish, dis-
jointed, and of course pointless.
After reading Bob's article we
learned that: I-He wishes we had
never entered Vietnam (yawn);
2-He doesn't understand what
"power" is; 3-He doesn't like the
Cold War; 4-He doesn‘t like for-
ner President Johnson and last
but not least 5-He doesn‘t like
President Nixon.

Now isn’t that marvelous. I'll
bet you didn't know that Bob
would “much rather be a traitor
in the eyes of Mr. Nixon than a
son-of-a-bitch in the eyes of
God." I'll bet you‘re just thrilled
to pieces with this new know-
ledge. And it’s a lucky thing it
was put on page one. Otherwise
we might have missed it.

The Newest ln Apathy

Is it just my imagination, or
has everyone here at State gone
bananas. No one but NO ONE is
buying books this semester. It's
already the third week of classes
and I've bought only two texts
(woe is mcl), class assignments
never seem to get themselves
finished (not that they ever used
to but the l-don't-carc syndrome
now appears to have reached
epidemic proportion) and the
sweet scent of marijuana can be
found even in the stiiirwclls in

Left-Wing Economics
Explained

Sometimes a little item can slip
by almost without notice. That
cartoon on the editorial page Oi
the last issue of the ASP first
appeared on this campus in
“Sweetfire” (remember them?)
It shgws a valiant but exploited
working woman who laments
her inability to make a lot of
money. “I got a real job over at
Zenith," she says. “I solder these
little things all day long. Each
part I make sells for $5.98. I
make about 30 of these in an
hour and I put in seven hours a
day. Dat [sic] comes to
$1255.80 a day. Boy what a
salary! But the boss don‘t pay
me dat."

Now why, I ask, should he (or
she, her boss could be a wo-
man)? Because, you reply, she
makes $1255,80 worth of pro-
ducts. But does she?“Each part
I make...l make about thirty of‘
these an hour..." She makes?
All by herself?! If she works at
Zenith, or even if she doesn’t,
she probably doesn't make any-
thing. More accurately, she is a
part of the production mech-
anism. That is why she receives
only a part of the money re-
turned by the sale of the pro-
duct she helps to make. If this
were not the case, i.e. if she
really did make $1255.80 worth
of products a day all by herself,
then she could sit in her living
room for seven hours a day,
make her products, market
them, and keep all the income
she gets. But she can‘t. She
needs help. She needs hits of
help.

The people who supply the
capital, who miirket her product
for her, etc, do not do these
things for fun. They do it for
money, which is why she solders
things for seven hours a day,
too. It is only to be expected
that all of the other people who
are instrumental in the pro-
duction and sale of little Zenith
parts, also receive part of the
incomi- carried through its sale

Test It Before
You Buy It

by Ken Stoken

Masculine, Psilocybin, THC,
treated grass, opt-ted hash - do
these things really exist?

Studies of thousands of drug
samples from Street Drug Analy-
sis Centers in Los Angeles, the
University of Michigan, the
University of Massachusetts,
Broome County (SUNY Bing-
hamton) and the entire state of
Maryland have recently shown if
such dope does exist - they
haven’t seen any of it. '

Do you really know what
you're dropping, smoking, snort-
ing, or shooting?It seems that
drug users really stand an enori
mous chance of being ripped-oft
by dealers and friends that most
probably are no more know-
ledgeable than they are about
the real content of the dope
they are copping. Studies in the
above mentioned areas have
shown that between 66% and
74% (depending upon the area)
of all street drug samples sub-
mitted were either misrepr-
esented or adulterated. Mesca-
line, Psilocybin, and THC appear
to be virtually non-existent any-
where in the tested areas. Mesc
and Psilo smaples seem to
usually turn out to be LSD,
amphetimine, PCP, some com-
bination of these substances, or
nothing at all. No evidence has
yet been found of opiated hash
or grass and if grass has actually
been treated with anything, it‘s
usually PCP.

During the past year and a half
the Committee to Develop a
Drug Analysis Center, under the
chairmanship of Ken Kohlhof,
has been preparing a "Capital
District Drug Analysis Center
Proposal" and working towards
its impletation through the
SUNYA Campus. Kohlof, who
graduated from here last May
with a degree in Chemistry, is
presently a graduate assistant on
the Campus Center staff and

seeking an MBA, and has in-

formed me that the movement
for the establishment of the
Analysis program here on cam-
pus has recently been proceeding
well. (Specifics on the program
will follow in a later article.)
Here is exactly how it is done:
i. Mailers will be available to
the university at the Campus
Center information Desk and at
Middle Earth (Ten Eyci: Hall,
Dutch Quad) starting Tuesday,
January 30.
2. liidivrduzds Wishing to sub-
mit samples will pick up mailers
at these two points and send
them with the enclosed drug
sample to the designated address
(a commercial lub's, in New
York City, post office box)
where they will be uniilysiZed.
'I'he mailers are numbered and
thc numbers would be copied
down for later reference.
3. The samples are analysized
and the results of the analysis
sent to Middle Earth. The sender
may obtain these results by call-
ing Middle Earth (Crisis Linc
4576300) and stating the num-
her that appeared on the mailer
he used. There will be about a
five day wait from the time the
mailer is postmarked and results
will be given out once and only
once per sample number.
Student response to this tem-
porary service may help to deter:
mine the future of the Drug
Analysis Center which will hope-
fully be set up on this campus.

Results of the iinulysizcd sam-
ples will be published regularly
(without sample numbers) in
campus publications for wide-
spreiid ilissennnalioii of the
information obtained from the
analysis. More information on
the temporary drug testing 5ch
Vice and the SUNYA Analysis
Center Will follow in future
issues of tlnl ASP.
