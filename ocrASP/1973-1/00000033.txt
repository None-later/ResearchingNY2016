It was only five yars ago that
the SUNYA Master Plan pro-
posed the building of academic
podium extensions, a large field
house, married student housing,
a planetarium and conference
center, and numerous other large
projects designed for an eventual
student population of over
23,000 students.

But when we look around
SUNYA today we see what
appears to be a complete campus
smaller than the one called for :n
the master plan. Big projects like
field houses and podium
extensions, our administrators
told us, would have to wait
possibly for decades. Perhaps.
they told us, they would iii-yer
be built

The reasons for this sudden
halt in expansion were never
really explained. All the adminis
tration said was that there “isn't
any more money" and thal "the
legislature turned it down."

Perhaps it‘s now possible to
look back from our vantage
point of 1973, and to reflect on
the causes of the end of SUNY's
Golden Years.

It all seems to have stemmed
from a rather drastic change in
the mood of the electorate The
same Governor who at one time
pushed for massive SUNY
expansion, now seems to be
trying to cut back his own
creation The legislature, and
even Governor Rockefeller, have
taken the opposite tack. In a
recent press conference,
Rockefeller said that the taxpay
era are “fed up" with being
heavily taxed and not receiving
"adequate social servuzes. "

Consequently, he said he will
push for the creation of a new
“inspector general" partwhm'
task it would be to examine all
the state‘s educational programs

 

with an eye for budget cutting.
The idea is to satisfy the taxpay-

PAGE EIGHT

ers by cutting waste and ineiii-
ciency, and anything else they
don't seem to like anymore (in-
cluding perhaps research pro-
grams, fellowships, and the like).

It's all part of what some
observers see as a l“new anti--
intellectual movement" in the
state and nation, one in which
the clectorate's disdain for
educational systems has reached
unprecedented proportions
Witness a recent poll Voters
Were asked if llicy place “high
confidence" in university pro-
fessors. Ten years ago over 60%
had such “high confidence."
Today the figure has reached an
all time low of 32%.

So however you look at it, it
looks like trouble ahead for
education on all levels. The local

Golden Years
Are Over
by ( flt‘llll I'tlll .\ii.\!iI:

penchant for turning down
school district budgets is bound
to continue Even in wealthy
suburbia some school districts
are on the verge of financial
collapse

Anti on the national level,
Nixon's l‘J7-l budch request is
expected to eliminate many of
the long standing, "sacred cow"
programs. including Head Start
and much of the special assis
Lance to inner city schools
enacted under the Johnson Ad
ministration. These programs
have been deemed "failures" and
will be pared in an effort to keep
spending below $168 billion

A well-known New York State
assemblymiin recently reflected
what seems to be the views of ii
large number of his colleagues
and constituents when he
remarked that “waste of many
projects," "big salaries for pro‘

fessors" and a lot of “fine arts
stuff" should be cut from the
State budget

Quite obviously, the conse-
quences of such views are serious
for the future of education.

And although the economy of
the slate and nations appears to
be on the upswing, the public
still seems to think that too
much is lieing spent on educa-
tion and the public sector as a
whole. The fact that Americans
are saving at record rates seems
to show that this is more a value
judgment rather than iltl indlt‘tl'
tion of economic hardship

'I‘his university was conceived
and planned during the i-duca
tioiially enlightened years of
Kennedy's New Frontier It was
built with the help of Johnson's
Great Society and Itoclti-felli-r's
Liberal Republicanism.

But that is all behind us now,
as we face an uncertain future
under Richard Nixon's "New
American Revolution" and his
desire to hold down social wel
fare and education budgets

Today there is no longer
enough impetus. Spuliiik had
caused a broad reappraisal of
national goals, the ii-sull being
not only ii desire to close the
"missile gap" but the “brain
gap" as Well But that iili-iilisni is
gone

Now we have disillusioniiii-iit
With edUciitiori, caused in part
by the distaste left in the public
mind after the campus turmoil
anti the apparent failure of many
social programs willi which
intellectuals were

Letters to the Editor

Don't Be
Hoodwinked !

To the editor:

In the Friday, Jiinuary 19th
issue of AS? you ran two seduc-
tive weight loss invitations. One
was in the lower left-hand corner
of page 4 and was very obviously
an advertisement. I feel that as
in the ordinary press you should
have in print at the top of such a
column the word “Advertise-
ment.” The second‘ appeared on
page 7 under “Services.” One
can only conjecture what this
enticement involves.

I would remind students that
there is only one way for ii
healthy person to lose weight
and that is very simple and
well-known to iill.

I would hope our intelligent
students would not be trapped
into buying, for either $2.00 or
$5.35, weight reducing gim-
mieks.

Big Bad Richard
Not So Bad

To the editor:

One could almost assume from
the gloomy attitudes expressed
in all the Vietnam articles iii Ihe
ASP (1/26/73) that the eiiil of
the war was the worst news you
people have had in months. i
suspect that you haVe been htirp'
ing about that "maniac in the
White House who loves to bomb
women, children, and hospitals"
for so long that the reality of
Nixon ending the war has prolr
ably not sunk in yet.

What a horrible shock that
must be! During the election
campaign a certain candidate
from South Dakota whincd aiiil
sputtered that he, the guardian
of all righteousness, would with
draw all American troops within
90 days of the Inauguration. No
ceasefire, no guarantee of l’OW's
released, no attempt at any kind
of a settlement.

Now big bad Richard has us
out within GU days, Willi a cease
fire, with POW release, and some
semblance of an end to lhi-
conflict.

It must be awfully hard to
accept the fact that the “Peace
Candidate" won; aiirl you didn't
even know who he was

and eventually chose to escalate
it was because a shining corps of
Harvard-graduate advisors, re-
tained from the Kennedy Ad-
ministration out of respect for
the late President, guided him
ineptly in that direction only
to desert him later and to be-
come some of his most virulent
critics. In addition, military in-
telligence fallaciously informed
Johnson at the time that in
order to achieve the necessary
objectives in Southeast Asia the
United States would have to
engage in active military activity
there for only a few months.
Due to no fault of his own,
Johnson soon found himself
hopelessly entrenched in a war
which was becoming increasingly
unpopular but from which he
could not withdraw in fear of
(l) alienating our allies and of
12) setting a precedent of Com-
munist expansion in Southeast
Asia; both of these unfortuante
consequences would have re-
sulted inevitably in a shift of
power from what Mayer so dis-
ilainfully calls the “free wor i"
to the ('ommunists.

To cope with his situation
Johnson could have attempted
to whip the nation into a par
oxysm of anti-communist sen-
timent with the shrewd use of
effective rhetoric, but he refused
to do so; what he did attempt to
do repeatedly was to negotiate a
settlement with the Commu-
nists, but repeatledly he was
frustrated by a totally unrecep-
iive enemy On the other hand,
Johnson could liaVe withdrawn
abruptly from Vietnam thus
muting the vehement protests of
those against his war policy,
improving his image with the
public, and insuring his own
political future. Even though it
would havr- been politically
opportune to abandon his own
convictions. Johnson refused to
do so. He was genuinely con.
viiiced that remaining in Viet-
nam represented a course of
action which was in the best
long range interests of his
country, and if he had to suffer
lllt‘ torment of the protestors
who eyentually broke his heart
or if he had to sacrifice his own
M't'iiiltl term in office, then so be
II, for Johnson, who Mayer des-
i'i'ilii-s as “Weak”, no sacrificr‘,
iiol even his life, was too great
for his country liut now he is
dead, and it is evulenl that the
\'t'l'll]lll who Verbally pccked and
gnawed at him until he was dead
are now ileligliteilly feasting over
his rciiiiiins

And when there is nothing to

ls lr Revolution Yer, Mommy?

by Mike McGuire
A script for an imaginary television show of the present: ~
Middle-aged man walks on stage, sporting a wide grin.
Man: Good evening everybody. I‘m Pud Cholera, and we're here to

I play “To Tell Forsooth." What‘s your name, please?

Nam her One: My name is Abdul Al~Fanatiq, and t'm leader of that
vanguard of senseless Violence, Grey October. In the past several
weeks, we’ve blown up several airliners, mailed bombs all over the
world, and stopped the Olympics with a daring holocaust.

Host: Number Two, what's your name, please?

Number Two: I'm Abdul Al-Fanatiq, and recently I’ve led Grey
October as they violated every standard of moral decency with the
Lod Airport massacre, attacks on Israeli schoolbuses, and several
unplanned airline excursions to the Holy Land.

Host: Number Three, what’s your name, please?

Number Three: I’m Abdul Al‘Fanatiq, and under my leadership
Grey October spied on the Democrats, assassinated Walt Disney,
hijacked a relief plane en route to NicaragUa, planned to send two
Zionist eat-Presidents to Paradise, and, most dastardly of all, rigged
the Superbowl.

Host: And now we ask your celebrity panel to find out who’s
“telling forsooth." Each "no" answer gets $50,000, two parachutes,
and an Algerian visa. We'll start with Peggy Crass.

Crass: Number One, do you feel that one should work peacefully
within the system to achieve constructive social change?

Number One: NO!

Host: That's one card down and three to go. Tom Postum?

l’oslum: Well, Number Two, I'll bet that action at the airport
