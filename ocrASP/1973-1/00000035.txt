By Duval Snowden

Nowadays when you pick up an alburii labeled
Kudu or CTl containing the talents of any one of
these great jazz musicians-Hubert laws, Joe Ilen-
dersorr, Freddie llubbard, George Benson, and
Johnny Hammond-you are liable to ﬁnd listed on
the back, under personnel, the natne of Billy
Cobham.

Billy Cobham, a solid percussionist for twenty
years, has worked his way frotti the oblivion of
thousands of unknown drummers to third place on
Dowrrbeat's Jam. and Pop Poll.

I find ilie opportunity to intervtew Billy after his
concert with Maltavrshnu on Sunday and | asked
him how it feels to Irave tttoved in one year froitt
l‘)th on the Jail. arid l’op I’nll to a position
preceded by only lilvrn Jones and Buddy Rich.

“It’s good to know that people appreciate you.
Because out of a combined total of readers of
Downbeat arid those who heard me play, about 50
per cent of people voting ttre in a position of third
must have felt something. That riiearis I’m not only
“getting over" in my playing but I'm now coming
into recognition, which is hard for a lot of players
to do. lilvin Jones is just now coming rtito full
recognition."

As the conversation went on, we got to talkitrg
about the number one position on the Jan poll and
the man it's held by.

“Buddy Rich is an excellent soloist, his attack on
the formation of solos is very great. However, Rich
is still iii the itiusic rust for himself. He plays only
for liirriself arid not to exemplify any of the group.
And to be playing like tltal is very selfrsli, par
ticularly when it corrcertis the other musicians
involved. I personally would like to be thought of as
the drtniirrier who can statid out wrtlr the group.
When I’m playing I do exactly that it's very
rrriportarit to be able to play wrtlr musicians and riot
against them."

for those who want to calcli the Maliavrslinu
again, or rriaybe for tlie first tune, they will be
appearing at Madison Srpiare (iatdcti, l'clt I'oiuin,
Match IX. Brit for those who warit to catch Billy
('obharn before Iliat, he will be back in the area
next week to tap to tire sortie trioic arid to do a
drum cliritt, in Troy. Anything sooner than that,
you’ll have to settle for rust listening to White
Rabbit by (reorge Benson or the other new releases
by llunrnrond itlld (.‘aiter.

“The best that we are capable
of. The best that we are." Those
are the words that John
McLaughlin used Sunday title in
the brief invocation he gives
before the Mahavishnu Orchestra
plays. And though John is far
too modest to add to that, one
might as well simply say that
they are the best. In the year

and a half since John and his

musicians came together they‘ve
proven that again and again, in
concerts all over the country,

and on two magniﬁcent albums

The Inner Mounting Flame

and the justvreleascd Birds of

Fire.

Most of Sunday’s concert was
devoted to material front that
new album. opening wrtlr the
majestic cyrttbal llourishes and
rushing violin-guitar leads of the
title cut itself. The overall effect

of “Birds of Fire" is quite simi-

lar to that of “Meeting of the
Spirits," which used to he the

lrrveterate fans of John
Mayall, who warit everything
he's ever done, should be in
terested in knowrng that he has
tirade art albiirir as a sidertiari of
one of his sidernen, trurtipet
player Blue Mitchell. For those
who think Mayall discovered
Mitchell, forget it. He’s been a
prorttinerrt trumpet player iti
jail for a long time. Mayall has
only allowed liirii to fill his
wallet for the first time.

The name of this alhutit is
Blues" Blues (Mainstream 374)
and includes tttatiy other John
Mayall regulars, such as Freddy
Robinson on gurtar and llerrtiarr
Riley on terror. Mitchell plays
sortie tiice blues choruses here
arid there, but nothing really
outstanding. Mayall plays lior»
ribly and obtrusively. The group
never really gets it together.
Still, this album will probably
sell better than any that Milcliell
has ever tirade.

lzver since thiiriiy Smith cartie
on the scene, no organist has
been able to escape comparison

band’s opener. The Mahavishnu
Orchestra operates at the highest
energy level that any perform-
ing ensemble has even attained,
and the dense ferocity of their
attack delighted aficiondos as it
overwhelmed a small minority
(apparently unready for the
band’s music) who soon depart-
ed. The volumc level was rather
high but very full; All-Sound
Audio did an excellent job in
dealing with the gym's acoustical
difﬁculties, and the balance was
perfect (so much so that a good
portion of the audience didn't
realize that the first solo on
“Birds of Fire" was being taken
by keyboard player Jan llarirrrier
on synthesizer. John was playing
tracking chords on his twelve—
string guitar, but rrrariy seetiied
to think that he was soloing).
Creating the proper fullness for
this kind of music without deaf-
ening the audience is very diffi-
cult, and the results weren't per-
fect (it was deafening); I don‘t

think that ttiey will be until the
band is rich enough to sink half
a million dollars into a custom-
ized personal PA system. Til
then, All-Audio’s handling of the
sound must be considered about
the best attainable.

The bartd is also beginning to
explore musical fortns with a
more urellow litre. “Open Coun-
try Road“ exhibited a highly
developed melodic strain and the
ertsenible jamming was more
playful and less intense than in
"Birds." Jan l’lammer's synthe-
sizer work is featttred more
prominently now. and John did
several duets with drummer Billy
(‘obliam using his twelve-string
as a lead instrument (earlier.
he'd lrsed it only for backing
chords and massive, chorder
flourishes). John's been playtrig
wrtlr ('arlos Santana hiter
(John‘s influence is ohvioits on
Santana's latest Ll’), and a bit of
Carlos‘s rliythrrric I'urrk could be
detected here. Electric Violinist
Jerry Goodman lays ntit riiore
than he used to, btit his .XtrIris are
even faster and more atria/trig.
and Ire still delights audiences by
occasionally playing the Violin as
a guitar. ererr the volume level
declined precipitously for the
semi-acoustic “Dreams.” Jerry
came down to supply surprising-
Iy delicate background colora-
trorr for John‘s acoustic gurtar
magic.

When the Mahavrshriu ()rchesr
tra departed after an hour and a
half of alrtrost non-stop music.
the gym wrtnessed ati event al-
most as rare (lately) as the
evening‘s full house: a sustained
standing ovation that brought
the hand back for a few kind
words from John and a twenty-
mrrrute encore of material from
the earlier albtirrr.

'l'he Albarry Symphony ()r-
cliestia opened the program with
at "Pops" concert almost identi-
cal to the one they delivered last
week at the Palace Theater. With
due respect to all concerned.
