Administrators Interviewed on New Policy

by Mindy Altman

[n the past, the presidents of
the 29 campuses of the SUNY
system have always been appoin-
ted for indeﬁnite terms. Now
however, due to a decision made
by the system's board of lrus-
tees, the presidents will each be
appointed for S-year terms, at
the end of which they will be
reviewed and evaluated.

  

Louis Salkever

This new policy raises :i num-
bcr of qucsiions. Among them
are in what ways. if any. Will

 

 

dents who were interviewed
seemed to feel that the new

'policy for levaluating the presi-

dents is a good idea. Said Sal-
kever: “Experience indicates
that the job of president is more
wearing than if has been in the
pasi - the average time in ofﬁce
reflecis this. The 5-year period
gives the opportunity to deter-
mine whether or not a particular
presideni has sufﬁcient freshness
and iniercsi to continue in
ofﬁce."

However. though ihc S-year
reviewing policy is seen as :i
good concepl, the view was ex-
pressed ihiii ii is nothing lhal is
really new, bui rather a formali-
zing and syslcmaiiying of sonic-
iIiing which has already existed.

Not Threatening
None of the administrators
ﬁnd the new policy as particular
ly “threatening” to their posi-
tions even though the arrival of a

general on a lower level would
be affected. and that there
would be no major effects on
any speciﬁc programs or on lea-
dership. With faculty and sin-
dents as sensitive as they are to
university leadership, good per-
formance is compelled. What's
more, is ihai when the president
of a university is evaluated. then
esseniially, so are those who are
closest to him.

seems to be that the new 5-year
evaluation system of president is
not any sort of drastic step or
major change from the exisling
system. The administrators, in
judging how the new system
would affect their own positions
and the quality of education,
were not looking at the new
system in terms of “politics,”
bul rather as a “higher-minded
kind of thing," as Hartley put il.
After all, the Board of Trustees
who will be doing the evaluating
are affecled by other people,
and by the checks and balances
in ihe stale system of govern-
incni. Nothing is left to their
discretion eniirelv. As Martin
