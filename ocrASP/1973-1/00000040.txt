One of the most often heard
complaints about this school is
that the campus is cold. and
unfriendly. To a regretfully large
extent this is true. But to those
studerits who believe this, and
there are many, it is quite pos-
sible that they haven't looked
closely enough.

There are twelve organizations.
located on Colonial and Dutch
Quadrangles that supply an an-
swer to this problem They are
"Greek" organizations. fraterni-
ties and sororities. Mainly social
groups, composed of between
thirty and seventy individuals.
they comprise around ten per-
cent of the SUNYA student
body. Ten percent who would
say this campus isn't so cold and
unfriendly.

Despite the beliefs of many,
they are not just social organiza-
tions. Our two key words are
friendship and involvement.
Greeks take an active role in
virtually all student activities. In

such as Holiday Sing, Telethon.
State Fair. Homecoming, and
the AMIA program ,would be
sadly lacking if not for the sup-
port and involvement of the
various fraternities and sororr
ties.

Greeks are very much a part of
the various student governance
bodies, comprising them ii great
deal more. percentage-wise than
the ten percent they comprise in
the entire student body.

Greeks are also community

picnics. Many of them are Big
Brothers and Big Sisters for
needy children. even sponsoring
a few foster children.

Greeks work together. play to-

their constitutions. The friend-

and living together in an atmos-

are lasting friendships.
