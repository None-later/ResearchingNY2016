If Shakespeare hadn't come up with the line, “Lord, what fools
these mortals be,” it is a cinch that Mel Brooks would have gotten
around to coining it. Brooks, writer-director-actor, has made a career
of showing just how foolish he and his fellow-man can really be.
Currently, a sampling of what crazy antics they are capable of can be
seen in the adventure-comedy he wrote and directed, “The Twelve
Chairs." which opens at the SUNY Cinema, Feb. 3, at 7:30 and 9:30
in LC 18

“The Producers,” Brooks’ first venture in a feature-length film as
writer and director, won an Oscar for his highly original story and
screenplay.

He started to write comedy material for Sid Caesar in the late
‘40’s Following that work-out, he teamed with Carl Reiner to make
the now-famous “2000-Year-Old Man” comedy album. And Brooks
has managed, throughout his career, to keep topping himself.

“The Twelve Chairs“ is based on the novel by [if and Petrov, a
team of Russian writers who took a satirical look at their
post-Revolution homeland in the twenties and thirties. Sidney
Glazier, who was responsible for "The Producers," was executive
producer on Brooks‘ latest film.

Science: The Artificial Cell

by Saul-Paul Sirag/AFS

Here is a recipe for artiﬁcial
cells: to a buffered solution of
hemoglobin add ether. Stir until
the hemoglobin disperses into
tiny particles suspended in the
ether. Add an ether solution of
cellulose nitrate. A thin Iriyer of
cciiodion will coat each of the
hemoglobin particles. These
coated particles are quite tough
spheres and can be separated
from the ether by centrifugal
force. They are artiﬁcial cells.

We call man-made things artiﬁ-
cial and we ordinarily think that
there are limits beyond which
artiﬁciality cannot go-—at least
not in the near future. Artiﬁcial
cells we did not expect to see so
soon, But for the boldness of
McGill University student
Thomas Ming Swi Chang, artifis
ciai cells might still be futuristic.
Chang started making artiﬁcial
cells as an undergraduate in
1956 and now as it physiology
professor at McGill has summa-
rized his work in the book,
Artificial Cclli' (Thomas. New
York, 197]).

inside the artiﬁcial cell mem-
brane is usually hemoglobin-the
complex blood protein that or-
dinarily carries oxygen. Hemo-
globin is used because it is a
large molecule that will not leak
out of the artificial cell mem-
brane, and it will reliably hold a
variety of enzymes that will
work on the smaller molecules
coming in through the artiﬁcial
cell surface.

Under the pressure of the de-
sire to survive. our species is
making itself more and more
artiﬁcial. The line between arti-
vicial and natural is continually
being pushed back.

Young View of Washington

Kangaroo Traffic Courts

WASHINGTON Every year
thousands of Americans driving
out of their home states ﬁnd
themselves arrested by local con‘
stables for traffic violations,
hauled before roadside justices
of the peace, and sent on their
ways thirty minutes later and
$25 poorer.

if you’ve never experienced
the frustration of that scene,
you are probably in the minor-
ity. Hundreds of miles from
home and anxious to reach their
destinations, the victims are
faced with two poor alterna-
tives-pay the fine (it’s more like
a ransom) guilty or not, or come
back weeks later with your
lawyer to fight a case that more
likely than not may be stacked
against you from the beginning.
The latter is no alternative at all
considering the expense and
inconvenience involved, and of
course, virtually everyone pays
the fine.

But that modern-day brand of
high-way robbery appears to lie
on the way out thanks to a
Supreme Court decision recently
which voided so-called "roadside
justice“ iii()1iio The court ruled
that persons may not be tried by
Judges who double as mayors,
and who are responsible for
raising revenue for their villages
with the fines they collect.

Nothing that such jurists have
a buillsin "incentive to convict",
the Court declared that defen-
dcnts were thus deprived of their
right to a fair trial. Similar court
systems in 16 other states were
called into question by the
(jourt’s ruling in the Ohio case.

But the time for cheering is
not yet. Under the ruling, these

mayor-judges will still be permit-
ted to collect forfeitures and
accept "free and voluntary"
guilty pleas. So the incentive to
pay and forfeit collateral is still
present and the opportunity for
using roadside courts in forced
fund-raising has only slightly
diminished The court, in effect,
has merely slapped the hands
which have been reaching regu-
larly into motorists‘ pocket-
books.

indeed, the decision did not
criticize or restrict in any way
the almost universal practice of
employing non-lawyers as
justices of the peace or magis-
trates. These weekend judges
often depend on convictions to
supplement their income, and it
is not an unheard of practice for
the arresting ofﬁcer and the con-
victing judge each to take their
cut of the fine,

Such a system isn’t justice. it‘s
blackmail masquerading in the
guise of a badge and a court
docket. And one slap on the
hand by the Supreme Court is
not likely to be enough to stop a
practice which is both en-
trenched and lucrative for all
involved-except the victim.

Perhaps one solution might be
to direct all funds collected as a
result of traffic violations into
the state‘s general fund, thereby
removing the local incentive to
convict unfairly.

it's something that should he
considered. Corruption in traffic
courts, small matter though it
may seem to some, is but
another direct and effective
means of lessening Americans'
waning faitii in all levels of their
government.

Who Is the Real Diana Ross?

by Ron Simmons

(Editor’s note: the following is
an imaginary interview with
Diana Ross.)

Ring...ring...ring...

Hello?

you accept the charge?

Yes. This is Diana Ross... Hello,
Ronnie?

Hey Diana, ruliul's huppcnin’?
Nothing much, I was on the
bedroom terrace watching the
kids play with their nurse. How’s
the column going?

0.K. I guess... Congratulations. I

saw “Luriy Sings lllt‘ Blues," and
you were fanlaslic.’

Thank you.

how does it fuel to be Billie Holiday?

Alright... but just between you

“1" was great, but the film was
garbage. As a historical docu~
merit it was a farce from the
beginning. Billy Holiday's life
wasn’t like that at all. She was a
strong beautiful person, not
some simple-minded, weak, frus-
trated singer who had to be
saved by some strong he-man
whenever the going got rough.
She was married more than once

ed the habit at least ﬁve times.
You read her book didn’t you?

Yes, but Diana it‘s only a movie
and movies have been known to
distort the truth a little.

No! it‘s not simply a movie. It
"claims" to be a major black
motion picture, produced by
blacks, for blacks, about an im-
portant black historical person.
You realize that years from now.

when she's completely for-
gotten, that movie will be on
television? Our children will
watch it and it’ll be the only
reference they’ll haVe of Billie
Holiday's life; and it's not true!
You know what ramiﬁcations it
may have? I just hope the
“Diana Ross” story is more
accurate.

Well if you dislike the idea so
much why did you do it?

1 had to! i had to show people
that l have real creativo ability. I
wanted to prove that i am an
artist. 1 just wanted to act, it was
Gordy's idea to produce Billie
Holiday. He didn't understand
what it meant to me. I was
trying to break away from the
commercial image, he just want-
ed to make more money. You
know he wanted me to use her
old tapes at first, i had forced
him to let me sing my own parts.
i guess he didn't think i had
talent either... in a way it's both
sail and funny.

Why did you think you didn't
llultt' ubilrly before?

What hail l evvr done to plow i
have? I sang songs, written by
other people, arranged by other
people and produced by other
people. Ronnie, anyone wttli it

good writer and arranger who
would write arrangements that
are. best for that particular voice.

What's wrong uirih tliul.’
Nothing if all you want is

money. But now i want more
than money, i want people to

appreciate me for my own abil-

i'm lonely, and have been for a
long time.

How can you be lonely... You
have friends and millions of fans.
Hell you're one of the biggest
stars in the world. I wish I was
that lonely.

You don't understand. They
don't really know me, they
think they do, but they don’t.

You know how many of them
think my real name is Diana? It's
not, it’s Diane... I was named
after my aunt. i changed it to
Diana when i was 18 because I

thought it sounded more glamor-
ous, but deep down inside i’ve
always thought of myself as
Diane. And Diana, not Diane,
got all the praise, all the wor-
ship, and all the money. i don't
want to sound conceited, but as
a singer I have been praised, and
at times literally worshipped.
And for what?... mouthing
words to songs, that’s all. Talk.
ing the way Motown trained me
to talk, walking the way Mo-
town trained me to walk, They
made my clothes, my face, my
entire image. And you should
read some of my fan mail, those
people scare me. I mean, I feel
like I'm reading letters to God.
They all want to be like me,
especially the gay guys. That
really blew my mind, if they
want to be like real women,why
copy me?
