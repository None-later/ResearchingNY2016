Dear "All: the Alp, ”

I've been seeing the same boy
for about two months now on a
very casual basis. The relation-
ship seems to be satisfying to
both of us, since "tithes-oi us
wants to get serious right now.

However, lately I’ve been
noticing little things that lead
me to believe that my boyfriend
is interested in my suitemate.
Although my suitemate has a
boyfriend of her own who she is
very happy with, I can't help
suspecting that my boyfriend is
attracted to her.

Naturally, this whole situation
has upset me very much and I
really don't know which course
of action is best. Should 1 con-
front. my boyfriend with my
accusations or should i just lei.
things work themselves out?

D.R.

Dear D.R.,

Accuslng your boyfriend of
being interested in your suite-
mate is a serious matter. If you
do so without sufﬁcient justifi»
cation, you may run the risk of
hurting both him and your suite-
mate. Since you were not spcci-
fic as to what sorts of “little
things" you‘ve been noticing
lately, I can only say that at this
point you would be wise to give
your boyfriend the bent-fit of
the doubt and assume that he is
only being friendly toward your
suitemate or that maybe you are
exaggerating his actions in your
mind.

However, keep your eyes open
from now on and if these “little
things" continue, then it would
be necessary for you to have it
out with him, but only after you
have enough evidence to support
your accusations.

Dear "Ask the Asp,"

I'm a freshman and live in a
four man suite on Dutch Quad.
Last semester, my whole suite
got along really well. Now,
everyone except me has decided
to rush sororities this semester.
Even though rush hasn‘t. really
gotten started, I feel left out
already. How can I keep from
feeling like an outsider with my
future Greek suite?

Independent

Dear Independent,

Under your present situation,
you might feel somewhat
pressured to rush a sorority
yourself. However, we helicvo
this would be a very poor reason
for becoming a Greek. We are
sure your witemales won‘t think
any less of you for remaining
independent. But as the semester
goes by, they will be spending
more time with the sorority and
less time in the suite. When this
happens, you should first make
an effort to learn more about
Greek life, so that the talk of
mothers and hell night won't
leave you out of the conVermr
lion. Next, you should take the
initiative in getting closer to
your non-rushing friends and in
developing your own outside
interests. The social whirl of
rushing will not be so enviable, if
your own life is an activv one.

Black Girl: A Beautiful Film

by Toni Brom
Affirmative Feature Service
Hollywood produces few satisr
lying films these days, but Black
(lirl is one of them. Director
Ossie Davis sticks to the basics
of characterization, dialogue and
interaction, working from a fine
play by Ms. J.E. Franklin. There
is little flashy “produetion
value" hereuno sensational drug
busts, violence, sex or breath-
taking cliiusc scenes. It's il
straightforward story of it com-
plicated black family, the self'
destructive forces within it, and
their resolution.

The cast is uniformly excel-
lent, without a single out-
standing performance to out-
shiiic the others, or a weak one
to detract from lhem. 'l'hc char-
acters are so lit-lii-Viihlti at; people
you forget the acting~~iind that's
it high compliment to the film.

As drama, it is not particularly
a milestone, hui Bloch (llrl is
always interesting and conveys a
moral lelih'tln in powerful
fashion. As an evening's enter-
tainment, it can't be beat.

For once, a black drama
doesn‘t lzlkl' place in a big city
ghetto. Mlllilll Rosie's family
rl‘hltiets in a working L'llulti suburb,
too obviously in the Los Aiigeles
ilfl‘ii but supposedly in Michigan.
Men play only a peripheral role
in llii! family The tensions and
lllinil of the iiiteriilion are he-
lwl‘i'll three generations of black
women, Mums Rosie, her grown
daughters and her mother.

Mama Iloiile works in it while
woman's house to support lll:r
daughters, and lives vicariously
through her college-education
adopted daughter Neltu. Rosie's

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

own daughters are married and
live nearby, but haven‘t ad-
vanced above their mother's
social position. They hang
around Rosie's house a lot,
acting like the wicked sisters in
Cinderella. The black princess in
this case is Billie Jean, daughter
by another man, a dreamer who
wants to make a career as zi
danCcr.

Neither Mama Rosie nor her
daughters think much of that.
Rosie wants an educated
daughter and the sisters don't
want to set- any advancement
that would draw family affec-
tion from them.

So the drama unfolds, cen-
tering on unopened and hidden
letters, the aspirations of Billie
Jean, jealousy toward the
adopted college girl Nelle, and
the slow process of self-
awnreness ms Miimii Rosie begins
to understand her own harsh
demands on those around her.

Sure, it’s heavily melodrae
matic. Under different circum-
stances, il. is a common enough
story played out. in thousands of
upwardly mobile white families.
The difference is that the
possibility for upward mobility
is suddenly real for blacks,
making the family conflicts real
and terribly important. it is
meaningful now for young
blacks to see ii sister fight
throuin those fiimily hassles and
jealousy and still make it.

The specific circumstances of
Miimii Rosie's family-1i much
more fluid assembly of relatives
than exists in ii typical while
uuhurbun family-lends particular
fascination to the film foriwhiusa.
’l‘lie interrelationships, jealousy
and role-playing become
infinitely more complex, and an

the web tightens, more difficult
to escape.

The struggle for advancement
and the pursuit of a personal
dream-abated to one extent or
another by all the characters in
Black Girl--is a basic human one,
though segments of the white
left might be jaded about it.
That struggle, ﬁrst made indiv-
idually in the family and then
collectively, makes all the
difference; there's no social
movement without it. Black Girl
is an old-fashioned primer on the
importance of respecting your-
self. It's a beautiful film.
