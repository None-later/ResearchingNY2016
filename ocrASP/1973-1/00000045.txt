Letters to the Editor

Coronary Phlebotomy

To the editor,

My heart bleeds for Mr. ('olorI's pour
bookstore and its poor parent FSA. both
of whom cannot seem to operate near
anything other than the brink of fIIIaIIciIIl
disaster. And no wonder: for. us Mr.
Colon so lucidly explaim in the January
30 ASP. “books are being sold at some-
thing of loss." | for one feel shumc at
having bad-mouthed these noble and self-
sacriﬁcing institutions for four years. “If
the student had to buy his botth else-
where," Mr. Colon furlltcr explains.
“they'd have to pay even more." Such
shining altruism brings [cars In my eyes.

Thank you for your C(lllL‘t‘lll about us
students. Mr. Colon. but i want In Iillllll
attention to even VllSlL‘l scllsarIIlIt-c than
yours. Last scmcsICI :I ccrIIIIII Inuit-wit

The rcfmendum fault; to make u distinc-
tion between the student activity tax and
the athletic fee. Due to the narme of
compelilive athletics. the team sIzes must
be liIIIItcd. Funhermore, only football
and basketball aIIIacI a sizeable amount

The student 'dCllVIIy fee goes to support
the Sludcnl Association groups. These
groups covet rccrealional. cultural. aca-
demic. and politlcal concerns. Most of
these IrIoups do not exceed tlIIrlv to

forty members. The total membership of
these groups fail to exceed 50% of the
student body. Must the remaining halfof
the student body Support these activities?

The mandatory tax has other disadvan-
tages besides forcing the majority to
finance the minority. The Board ofTrust-
ccs Resolution adopted March 24, I‘l7l
put many restrictions on mandatory stud-
ent tax monies. The use of funds is
restricted to programs which benefit the
campus community in the following catc-
gorics: I. Programs of cultural and educa-
tIonal enrichment, 2. Recreational and
social activities, 3. Tutorial programs. 4.
Athletic programs, both intramural and
intercollegiate, 5. Student publications
and other media, 6. Assistance to recog-
nized student organizations, provided
that the purpose and activities of the
organization are of educational, cultural,
recreational, or social nature, 7. lnsnrance
related to conduct of these prOgrams. 8.
Administration of these programs, 10.
Reimbursement to student officers for
service to student government.

Even if ('enlrul Council appropriated
money IoI an area slightly out of the
realm of these guidelines. the chief ud-
IIIIrIisIIuIIvc officer of the Universlty has
the final authorin of enforcing the "ten
coIIIIIIaIIdIIICIIts" and thus would not
release IIIL' money. The Trustee‘s Resolu-
tions apply no such restrictions to a
voluntary lax. Thus if student opinion
was Interpreted to favor community
based activities, which would not really
benefit the campus community, the
Council could appropriate money for
these nIIrnnwc
The majority of students are paying a
tax for beneﬁts which they seldom, if
ever, use. This practice should not and
must not continue. Only you, the stud—
ents, can change this practice by turning
out to vote for the referendum. We need
207: of the students to vote to change the
present policy, so vote “yes” on the tax
referendum. Se”, Ugeluwl
