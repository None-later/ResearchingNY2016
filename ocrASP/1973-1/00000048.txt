Demolish Oneonta

by Kenneth Arduino

The Albany wrestling team
with revenge in its eye demo-
lished Oneonta Wednesday night
in an away match. Last year the
Danes had expected an easy
match and got beat badly. This
year they worked hard all week
long. ready to pay back their
opponents. They did and quite
handily as the 31-9 score might
indicate.

Oneonta might have gotten the
feeling that it was not their night
after the first match. Still unde-
feated Walt Katz demolished his
opponent 22-1. Coach Garcia
continued his praise of Katz and
called this match his best ever.

Albany lost the next two
matches. including the 134 lb.
class where Oneonta has the
conference champ. Ethan Gross-

Albany. In a battle of unbeatens
at the 142 lbs. the Dane’s Larry
Mims bested Oneonta's Nor-
leans. Both are great wrestlers
and might meet again at the
SUNY Championships.

Another undefeated Albany
wrestler, co-captain Jeff Al-
brecht won his match via a pin
in the second period. It is a
tribute to Jeff that he is hitting
stride now but was still able to
win before he hit it.

Swimming

by Steven J. Katz

Albany State Swimming Coach
Brian Kelly is a calm, taciturn
man. Coach Kelly, in a manner
much like U.C.L.A.'s John
Wooden, is a man of little out-
ward emotion. Whether it be a
hotly contested meet such as the
Stony Brook meet or a re-
sounding defeat such as the one
at the hands of R.I.T.,Kelly’s
demeanor remains the same.
There is little hint of the pres-
sure that goes with trying to
mold a winning swim team at
Albany State.

The swim season thus far has
been characterized by frustra-
tion and unfulfilled promise.
The meets of the spring semester
have for the most part been
agonizineg close. Albany takes
it share of events each meet.
Swimmers like Len Van Ryn,
Ken Weber and Marc Eson are
always clOSe to the top in their
events. Yet these wins servo only
to compound the frustration of
ii team that so far this season has
always fallen ii bit. short. An
extra win here or a second place
in some other cvr-nt and
Albany's record would he dras-
ticiilly different.

The cards iIll seem to lw turned
against Kelly and his swrmmvrs.

fcrcncc hrin l)t'(‘ll blessed with
fair greater amounts of funds.

owner of it briind ni-w fit) yd.
swimming pool. Limiti-d funds
and ii somewhat undeveloped
ri-cruiting system lItIVt’ pliiccd
Albany in il rut difficult to climb
out of. Fresh, new talent, thc
tonic that Albany desperately
needs, has been presented with
little incentive for attending
Albanv.

The swim team lacks the repu-
tation of continued success that
attracts so many ballplayers to
the basketball team’s tryouts
each year. Albany’s high aca-
demic standards and complete
lack of athletic scholarships all
but completely slam the door on
prospective Albany swimmers. A
vicious cycle presents a great
obstacle in the path of Albany’s
swimming hopes. Albany will
not attract more top-{lite
swimmers until it has more suc-
cesses. Yet Albany will not have
a winning season until it gets a
few more prospects.

Kelly’s task of building Albany
into a strong swimming school
will become even more difficult
at the end of the present season.
The one strong point of the
team this season, that solid nu—
cleus of seasoned, accomplished
swimmers, will be broken up by
graduation next year. Out»
standing swimmers such as Miirc
Eson, Juik Schubert, Pcti-
Gerstenhiibcr and Bill Hiirt who
graduated in Januury will be
difficult to replace. Eson is ii

put on two ridiculous moves:
one, a turn-around wrong

With the fans stomping from
the opening tap, the Danes come
out like fire. Albany never
trailed in the first half and three
times built a six point lead. Yet
despite the great ball they were
playing, the halftime ended tied
at 33. It seems that both
Gilliums were as good as their
press notices. Ron hit for 15 and
Dan added 8, to consistently
bring the Golden Eagles back.

seven. But here's where all those
intangibles like pride and team
character play such a big role.
And there were 3,000 tangible:
- 3,000 Albany fans who
refused to give up in their team.

First, Byron hit a follow-up to
cut the lead to three. Then
Troch got! fouled as he awished a
20 footer. He made the three
point play. Reggie, who had
reinjured his ankle, gamer came
back in. This got the crowd even
more wild as the screamed
“D-fense, D-fense."

5:26 — Bob Nossi gets not. A
22 foot jumper ties the game at
58. Ron Gilliam answers with a
bomb to give Brockport the
lead, but Reggie comes through
with an unreal 3 point play.
Gilliam hits two foul shots and
with four minutes left, it’s 62-61
Brockport.

Bob Rossi gives the crowd ran
orgasm with two more jumpers
iind in u fantasy of emotion, the
Danes stall the game. When
’I‘roch hits 2 free throws and
Reggie docs likewise, Brockport
is finished. The Great Danes
hold the mighty opposition to
one point in those final four
minutes. As the final seconds
tick away, the Albany team is

one big embrace.
