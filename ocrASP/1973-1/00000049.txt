Zionist Youth Movement and

before this season, put on a great
match before losing 6-4.

After that it was just about all
Albany. In a battle of unbeatens
at the 142 lbs. the Dane’s [airy
Mims bested Oneonta's Nor-
leans. Both are great wrestlers
and might meet again at the
SUNY Championships.

Another undefeated Albany
wrestler, co-captain Jeff Al-
brecht won his match via a pin
in the second period. It is a
tribute to Jeff that he is hitting
stride now but was still able to
win before he hit it.

Tom Horn lost his first duel
meet match against last year’s
runner-up in the Conference
championships. Horn is a real
comer and has been improving
steadily.

Albany received two forfeits at
167 and 177. Doug Bauer wrest»
led his wouldbc opponent zit
177 and easily defeated him in
an exhibition match.

Newcomer Frank Herman who
joined the IL’ilm for the second
semester won his first match of
the year. Frank, who wrestled in
High School, will add depth and
competition for the l90 lb. class
which has been a weakness this

year.
Undefeated in duel meets,
Rudy Vido rounded out the

scoring with an impressive vic-

tory in the heavy weight divi-
sion. Both Coach Garcia and
Coach Peterson felt it was a
needed match for Rudy to gtiin
experience and confidence,
Adding these ingredients to his
physical zilrributcs will make
him ii gi'ciii wrestler. Credit to
this Victory must go to the
wrestlers tlicmsvlvus. They have
not had :i match in it) days and
Il would have been easy to have
been out of condition. Hard

Swimming

by Steven J . Katz

Albany State Swimming Coach
Brian Kelly is a calm, taciturn
man. Coach Kelly, in a manner
much like U.C.L.A.'s John
Wooden, is a man of little out-
ward emotion. Whether it be a
hotly contested meet such as the
Stony Brook meet or a re-
sounding defeat such as the one
at the hands of R.1.T.,Kelly’s
demeanor remains the same.
There is little hint of the pres-
sure that goes with trying to
mold a winning swim team at
Albany State.

The swim season thus far has
been characterized by frustra-
tion and unfulfilled promise.
The meets of the spring semester
have for the most part been
agonizingly close. Albany takes
it share of events each meet.
Swimmers like Lcn Viin Ryn,
Ken Weber and Marc Eson are
always Close to the top in their
events. Yet these wins serve only
to compound the frustration of
a team that so far this season has
always fallen a bit short. An
extra win here or a second place
in some other event and
Albany's record would be (has
tically different.

The cards all seem to be turned
against Kelly and his su'immcrs.
Several other schools in the con-
ference have been blessed with
far greater amounts of funds.
Potsdam for example is the
owner of a brand new 50 yd.
swimming pool. Limited funds
and a somewhat undeveloped
recruiting system liavv [)itlcl‘d
Albany in a rut difficult to climb
out of. Fresh, new talent, the
tonic that Albany desperately
needs, has been presented with
little incentive for attending

Albanv.

The swim team lacks the repu-
tation of continued success that
attracts so many ballpiayers to
the basketball team's tryouts
each year. Albany’s high aca-
demic standards and complete
lack of athletic scholarships all
but completely slam the door on
prospective Albany swimmers. A
vicious cycle presents a great
obstacle in the path of Albany's
swimming hopes. Albany will
not attract more top-l’lite
swimmers until it has more suc-
cesses. Yet Albany will not have
a winning season until it gets a
few more prospects.

Kelly's task of building Albany
into a strong swimming school
will become even more difficult
at the end of the present season.
The one strong point of the
team this season, that solid nu-
cleus of seasoned, accomplished
swimmers, will be broken up by
graduation next year. Out-
standing swimmers such us Marc
Eson, Jaik Schubert, Pete
Gerstenhaber and Bill Hart who
gradualed in January will be
difficult to replace. Eson is a
two lettcrmzin and ii standout in
the backstroke nvvnt. “art was
also a backstroke mlll’i and the
second half decline of lhc team
has been linked in part to Hart's
cai‘ly graduation. Jaik Schuler
will graduate with four letters,
specializing in the butterfly
event. He was the team's co-cap-
tain for two years. Rounding out
the quartet that will he so sorely
missed noxt your is Petr-
Gcrslcnhaber, also a 'fly man.
Pete has a Chance to reach stale
finals in the butterfly event for
the third straight year.

Unless some new talent is un»
covered, next year may be an
extremely bleak season for the
Great Dane swimmers.

The lockerroomwas so packed
and so loud - a lot of skin
slapping, a lot of smiling faces-
players hugging each other,

narrow hall, in the visitor’s

coacii suddenly opened the door,
and pointing across the hall,
roared at his team, “That's how
a winner sounds.” That then, is
the Albany Great Danes — a
winner.

Brockport came into Univer-
sity Gym to destroy the incon-

clinch the SUNYAC crown, in
their arsenal Brockport shopped

had a pre-gamc tap drill to really
psyche you out. Butone thing
they did not have was the home
court edge.

Very close to 3,000 Albany
ftins packed the stands, the
aisles, and ovary open space in
University Gym. They came to
watch a great Brockport team,
but more important they came
to stand by their Danes us they
faced thi-ir toughest challenge.

Four In A Row For Pups

by Kenneth Arduino

The Albany Junior Varsity
basketball team using it tough
zone defense, held Adirondack
Comminity College to just lt'ii
points in the second half as they
won 67-43.

A large crowd, many of them
early arrivals for the Varsity
game, saw Ron Edmonds Coliil'
off the bench to lead a balancv

attack with tWelve points.
Albany which opened up an
early lead against the poor

shooting visitors, saw the lead
slowly dissipate as sloppy hall
handling and numerous turn-
ovcrs was the order of the day.
With the J.V. trailing for llil‘
'first time, Tom Newman sank
two free throws and ihen
Edmonds did his thing. He hit a
running lay»up, rebounded his
own missed shot and then scored
an unbelievable tip in to spark
the J.V. to a 37-33 lead at
halftime.

' 63 Byron Miller jumping like a
gazelle, had 10 rebounds and 12
points —- Bob Rossi, in the
ciutch, also 12 markers - and
Reggi. omlth. Reg had 7 re-
bounds, 4 assists, 15 points, and
put on two ridiculous moves:
one, a turn-around wrong
handed bank shot, and the other
a super-big 3 point play.

With the fans stomping from
the opening tap, the Danes come
out like fire, Albany never
trailed in the first half and three
times built a six point lead. Yet
despite the great ball they were
playing, the halftime ended tied
at 33. It seems that both
Gilliams were as good as their
press notices. Ron hit for If) and
Dan added 8, to consistently
bring the Golden Eagles buck.

The second half stiiricd like
the first. Again the Dunes built
two six point lends, the lust
49-43 with 1|:30 to go. 'l‘hen
Brockport put it together. In the
span of loss than five minutes,
the visitors run off a lfi-L! spurt
to seemingly bury iht' Danes. It
was 58-5]. the game was under
the sow-n minute mark, and

things looked vcry bleak.

seven. But here’s where all those
intangibles like pride and team
character play such a big role.
And there were 3,000 tanglblel
— 3,000 Albany fans who
refused to give up in their team

First, Byron hit a follow-up to
cut the lead to three. Then
'l‘i-och got! fouled as he swished a
20 footer. He made the three
point play. Reggie, who had
reinlurad his ankle, garner came
back in. This got the crowd even
more wild as the screamed
“D-fensc, Dfense."

5:26 — Bob itossi gets not. A
22 foot jumper ties the game at
58. Ron Gilliam answers with a
bomb to give Brockport the
lead, but Reggie comes through
with 1m unreal 3 point play.
Gilliam hits two foul shots and
with four minutes left, it's 62-61
Brockport.

Bob Rossi gives the crowd i an
orgasm with two more jumpers
and in a fantasy of emotion, the
Dunes still] the game. When
Trocli hits 2 free throws and
Reggie does likewise, Brockport
is finished. The Great Danes
hold the mighty opposition to
one point in those final four

minutes. As the final seconds
tick away, the Albany team is
one big embrace. '
