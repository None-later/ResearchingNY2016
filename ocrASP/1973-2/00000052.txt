Speaker on .I.F.K. Assassination

By Wayne Balducci
Special to the ASP

On November 22, 1963.
President John F. Kennedy was
assassinated while riding in a
notorcade through downtown
Dallas, Texas. Ten months later,
a presidential commission head-
ed by former Chief Supreme
Court Justice Earl Warren de-
livered the conclusions to their
investigation of the crime. Essen-
tially, what the Warren Report
stated was that the assassination
was the act of a single man, Lee
Harvey Oswald, who ﬁred three
shots from the southeastern
most window on the sixth floor
of the Texas School Book De-
pository Building. Two of the
shots found their mark and the
other missed. One of the bullets
allegedly passed through the
President's neck and went on to
wound Governor John B. Con-
nally. The other bullet struck
President Kennedy in the head,
exploding away a large part of
the right side ofhis skull.

Subsequent inquiry by various
individuals and groups turned up
many inconsistencies in the re-
port and found many un‘
answered questions about the
case. The controversy has been
raging ever since.

One group based in Wain
ington, DC. and comprised of
such notable figures as Bernard
Fensterwald, Jr., former Senate
Counsel and presently chief
counsel to James Earl Ray,
Richard Billings, journalist and
former associate editor of Life
Magazine and William Turner,
author and former FBI agent,
has for the past several years
devoted itself to the problems of
the issassination and the efforts

to resolve them. Named the
Committee To Investigate
Assassinations, this group has
collected and analyzed
mountains of evidence, even to
the extent of employing com-
puter systems in their research.

Perhaps the key piece of evi-
dence in the investigation is the
famous Zapruder film approxi-
mater 400 frames of 8mm color
film taken by Abraham Zap-
ruder, a Dallas C.P.A., as the
assassination took place 75 feet
away from him. This film clearly
shows the progression of events
as the presidential limosine was
fired upon. The film is a graphic
visual record of the slaying and
provides the opportunity for
precise spatio-temporal measure-
ments of the car and its passen-
gers. What the film renders
under careful scrutiny is a refu-
tation of the conclusion of the
Warren Report that a single
bullet wounded both Kennedy
and Connally and that the fatiil
shot to the President's head
came from abOVe and to the
rear. In fact, what the film
reveals is that the two men were
struck by separate bullets and
that the._l'atal head shot came
from the front and right. (Surv
prisingly, the Commission never
bothered to examine the film for
these important clues.)

Mr. Saltzman will show. the
Zapruder film as an integral part
of his program as well as some
footage of two other less cele»
brated movie sequences. The
greater part of the presentation
will be taken up with 2i large
number of slides of the more
than 500 photos that were
snapped during and immediately
following the assassination.

Along with the analysis of the
physical evidence, Mr. Saltzman
will also examine the nature of
the conspiracy, its participants
and scope as well as explanations
of the reasons behind it.

Mr. Saltzman will be open to
questions throughout the pro-
gram and will devote time at the
end to a general question and
answer period.

The presentation, sponsored
by the Student Association, will
begin at 7:30 p.m. in Lecture

Interview

by Kenneth J. Freed

WASHINGTON AP - President
Nixon’s Peking and Moscow
‘trips made the Vietnam settle-
ment possible, according to
Henry Kissinger, which in turn
frees the United States to work
even more actively for a new
global relationship. _

‘Whether the peace is fragile or
not,‘ Kissinger said Thursday,
‘depends in part on the
Vietnamese; it depends in part
on outside countries,‘

The presidential adviser added
during his first major broadcast
interview with CBS diplomatic
correspondent Marvin Kalb, that
'I don't trust the good will of
the parties.‘ .

A lasting peace depends in
large part ‘on the actions of the
Soviet Union, the Peoples
Republic of China and on the
sort of relationship we'll be able
to establish with North
Vietnam.’

What this means for Moscow
and Peking, Kissinger said, is for
them to see what massiVe mili-
tary aid to Hanoi means ‘in
terms of the incentives' sUCh
shipments lend to resuming the
lighting.

This also holds true for the
United States, the presidential
adviser acknowledged, but he
pIEdged strict adherencv to lIIl‘
ceasc~fire agreement signed
January 28, which limits the
American military aid to Saigon.

In explaining the overall U.S.
motivvs. the former Harvard

 

political Sl'll‘llllsl. said Nixon ‘l'i-lt

that we had to end the war on

honorable terms so that we
would be free to be taken
seriously in the conduct of other
events.‘

According to Kissinger, ‘when
this administration came into
office four years ago, Vietnam
was really our national obses-
sion. It was almost the only
foreign policy that was being
actiVely debated....the President
held the View from the beginning
that we had to change the
emphasis of that concern' and
this, he said, led to the Moscow
and Peking summits and the
arms-limitation agreements with
the Soviets.

In more narrow terms, of the
immediate chances for peace,
Kissinger told Kalb, “I‘he biggest
task is now to move a generation
that has known nothing but war
toward an attitude of perice,‘

This is the chief motch for his
trip next week to Hanoi,
Kissinger said, 'to establish a
new rclatioiiship.to establish

The Federation of American
Scientists announced this week
that it is challenging the Nixon
Administration and the defense
department because of their pol-
icy of developing and perfecting
environmental weapons of war.
The Federation is a nationwide
coalition of natural and social
scientists and engineers, formed
at the end of World War [I in
efforts to see that science would
be used for peace rather than for
war. The Federation’s Council
charged that the development
and continued use of environ-
mental weapons "offends the
conscience of mankind. and, in-
deed, may involve the Com-
mission of War Crimes."
Federation Director Doctor
Jeremy Stone said that the Fed-
eration had collected evidence
which indicated that weather
modification was first used by
the C.l.A. in South Vietnam in
1963 to control demonstrations
and to cover covert operations
there; Stone said that rainfall
was deliberately enhanced over
Laos in 1966 during an experi-
mental program——and that the
US. Joints Chiefs of Staff imple-
mented an operational program
of weather modification in [min-
china in 1967. The Pentagon has
never denied using such environ-
mental weapons iii Indochina.
saying only that such operations
"have not been carried out over
North Vietnam." 'l‘l‘ll‘ Pentagon
has not commented on weather
modification efforts over Laos,
Cambodia or South Vietnam.
The Federation, in a statement
this week, warned that weather
modification “can lead to other

dangerous innovations in geo-
physical warfare: the ateering of
storms, the manipulation of cli-
mates, the inducing of earth-
quakes and so on." Efforts in
the U.S. Senate to stop environ-
mental weapon research, led by
Senator Clifford Case, were
opposed and ﬁnally killed by the
Nixon Administration last year.

The Federation said that un—
usually heavy rainfall struck
North Vietnam in 1969 imme-
diately following U.S. cloud-
seeding operations, and that
thousands of civilian deaths re-
sulted. Said the Federation: “If
enhanced rainfall has caused
flooding in North Vietnam, the
participants in this episode will
be as guilty of war crimes as
those Nazi generals who were
convicted of destroying the
dikes in Holland in World War II.

Mummy Autopsy

DETROIT AP > An autopsy on
a 2,600-year-old mummy has
turned up a perfectly preserved
heart for the ﬁrst time, says a
harm of experts at Wayne State
University's School of Medicine.

The mummy is that of a 35
year old man.

Dr. Robin A. Burraco, report-
ing on Thursday’s autopsy, said
the embalming process had per-
fectly preserved the heart and
aortic blood vessel.

Barracu hopes to extract large
amounts of antibodies from the
dried blood to learn about dis-
eases in ancient Egypt. Such
research will reveal more about
the evolution of diseases in man,
he said.
