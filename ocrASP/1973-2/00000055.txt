Norman Daley:

The Elaborate Jake

By Bill Brina

The "discoverer" of Llhuro-
scian civilization, Norman Daley
of Cornell, is a pleasant bearded
artist who recently made the
astounding discovery that he
walks around on a pair of
wobbly, uneven stills with a
large bird perched atop his head,
or so he informed an attentive,
capacity audience in the Art
Gallery last Thursday evening.
His remarkable display, a parody
of a museum exhibit of ancient
civilization, has drawn the most
intense response that the gallery
has seen in some time, so per-
haps it was only natural that a
personal appearance by the artist
himself brought forth such dis‘
parate types as the two highest
administrative officers of the
university and the two largest
cocaine merchants in the Capital
District (presumably the former
were not aware of the latter).

Mr. Daley spoke for some
time, explaining his fascination
with the effects of set and
setting on the way man views
art, and on his own reflections
on the remarkably consistent
ways in which man's culture
inflicts injury on man's psyche.
Llhuroscian civilization as a
medium is a product of Mir
man's interest in alternative
settings for art; the exhibit as a
message is the product of his
concern with the way man
mangles himself. We all walk
around with the uneven stilts
and perched bird of the Llhuro-
sciun priest, and the artist him»
self has a particularly nasty fowl
to contend with.

None of this is exactly new
ground, The way Mr. Daley has
assembled this, however, and the
deftncss with which he fliiys
assorted sundry academic hides
make this exhibit a delight to
romp through. But is it really
art?

One viewer was heard to re
mark, "This is all one elaborate
joke. lt's amusing at first but it
wears thin quickly." ls this
exhibit the world's largest ouc
-liner‘.’ i don‘t think so. The
crucial distinction between art
and discourse lies in the de-
liberate, ultimately undecipcr-
able ambiguity of the former.
Critics can ponder, analyze, iirid
dissect, but what ultimately
makes art art is its ability to
emerge from the analytical pror
ecss with its mystery intact. Why

is the Mona Lisa smiling? What
makes Bitches' Brew more than
a collection of tones with speci-
ﬁed pitches, volumes, durations,

and so forth?

Where can this ambiguity be

found in the Llhuroscian
exhibit? The key to that
question can be found in the
plaque on which the rationale
for the collapse of Llhuroscian
civilization is stated: perfect
birth control and stupefying
apathy! When the ﬁrst cracks in
the Belief in Reason that cater
gorized the period of the En-
lightenment and of the nine»
teenth century edifice of science
appeared in the late 1800's,
there also rippeared the fore-
runners of those schools of be-
lief that suspect that our
Western Civilization is dead, or
at least dying. Anrl certainly the
twentieth century has provider]
ample ammunition for such are
guments. Are [UP the Llhuro-

And if so, urtiy’.‘ Here the
prophets of doom ari- hopelessly
divided One school liasi“|ly
maintains that our physical
abundance has led us to lost-
touch with the old verilics, thi-
olrl moralin (gent-rally irritr
sexual), truth, and
righteousness. This is the
classical “explanation” of the
decline and fall of Rome, and it
is an explanation that, on first
glance, the obituary of Llhuros
lends credence to. Yet another
school basically maintains that.
the fall of ii civilization is
generally due to the persistence
of obsolete customs, values, and
modes of action in it time in
which thc objective circum~
stances of the culture have been
trtinsl‘ormcrl.A careful examinzr
tion of the remainder of the
exhibit would seem to lend
credence to this theory.

And so the ambiguity Why did

Norman Daley doesn't tell us, he
throws back mirrored images of
our culture's contradictory
beliefs, and he sets those images
up in an unending oscillation.

Heartbreak Kid - lnescapable Cruelty?

By Nlike Lipprrm

Every young Jewish male l a his Vision of the
ideal woman. The trouble i:, this Vision may change
from time to time, and if N imbi-r 2 appears on the

third day of his honeymoon with Number I . . .
This situation is the basis for the blackly comic
“l'leartbreak Kid," a film eventually more tragic
that it is humorous.

Lenny Kantrow (Charles Grolin) finds his dream
in Lylah Kolodny (Jeannie Berlin), the epitome of
the New York JAl’ (on first impressions). She's not
so much the princess as she seems as Lenny finds
out on the first night of their honeymoon. Lylah’s
lovemaking alternates between imploring Lenny to
"tell me again how wonderful it was," chomping
Milky Way Bars, running off to "go pecpec," and
rapturing about the next ill) or 50 years together.
No doubt, Lylah is one of the most obnoxious
women in film history. She is makeup and sunburn
cream, sloppy double egg salad sandwiches, raucous
at the wrong times, not too bright, and very, very
real... exactly the person Lenny decides he never
wants to see again.

And then, enter Kelly, Kelly Corcoran (Cybil

Sheppard), the rich blond Minneapolis beauty who
steps out of a TV commercial into Lcnny's tor~
turous Florida honeymoon.
She is the Unattainable Woman, the creature that
every average middle-class New York Jewisli nothing
lusts after from afar and possesses only in fantasy. It
doesn‘t matter that there's nothing to her other
than her body; her entrance line (“you‘re lying on
my spot") is, to Lcniiy, more splendid that all the
wisdom and poetry of the ages. One touch (she
ruffles his hair), one cutesy gush (“you're my little
teddybear") and he is lost to this archetypal
cheerleader frotn the mysterious Midwest.

For Kelly, he risks everything. He divorces Lylah,
and runs off to bravo the subs/,cro Minnesota winter,
the Captain of~l£verylhiiig boyfriend, and the
pos. ssivr- father (Eddie Albert), the only one who
sees through Letiiiy's false life aiirl blustcring front
because he‘s an cxpci'l at it himself. But love rind
deli-riiiiiiatioii prevail, and Lenny finds himself at
llllilllll‘l' wedding With another stranger (at least he's
sli-pt Willl her he (liilllt! all the “how wonderful it

 

was") who already is showing signs of being more
than she rim)an

Lenny loses no matter what he does. He doesn't
know what he wants and can't tell the difference
between his conflicting dcsii't-s. llis women are
rcally no different. Kelly is richer, quieter, and more
chic than Lylah, but they're essentially the same
stupid, nagging person. Lylah won't sleep with
Lenny until after they're married-Kelly must wait a
day to think it over. Lylah yells, Kelly just crooks
her little finger. Lylah spends hours in front of the
mirror, Kelly comes out of an embrace smoothing
her hair. Neither is a prize for life, but Kelly is more
impressive to have by one‘s side, and isn’t that all
that counts? Both parts are splendidly acted, al-
though it struck me that this was the full range of
Ms. Shenpards talent, and she just might wind up
doing hair commercials. Jeannie Berlin, however,
looks like she could do anything she wanted to.
Charles Grolin has a part which calls only for
overacting, whether he is lying to his women, the
Corcoran's Kelly's jock friends, to himself, The real
Lenny doesn't exist, but Grolin puts oVer a few
convincing fantasies.

The film is highly touted as the product of Elaine
May‘s directing, Neil Simon's script and Bruce Jay
Friedman‘s idea. it's not evident where one ended
and the other took over, but the dialogue more
resembles a Nichols and May routine than it does
The Odd Couple. The best scenes are long dialogues
in which at least. one of the participants is verbally
destroyed, and it's htird to believe that Ms. May did
not write most of those scenes. She still has much to
learn about directing, such as what to do with a
camera, but since this is only her second picture, her
tendency to Vlt'W the film as an extrapolation of a
lelt-vtsion skit can be forgiven, especially as there are
some scenes which are brilliant. After Lenny has
tolrl Lylah he "wants out. of the marriage" and he
sees her grasp at happiness destroyed, the next scene
is a tracking shot of a Greyhound bus heading
North, while a lush arrangement of “Close to You"
breaks out.

The “Heartbreak Kid" may be derided for its
stereotypes, but its characters are all exploded by
the end The film rirls itself of the dangers of
sentimentality liy opting instead for ii cruelly, from
which no one escapes. if you sit through It lwtcc,
you might fiiid yourself squirming in shame (luring

Bingliamion Nip: Wrestlers

by Kenneth Arduino

And then there were three.
Albany‘s unbeaten ranks lost a
member this weekend when Jeff
Albrecht was beaten while the
Albany State wrestling team was
losing to Binghamton, 24-20.

Albrecht lost via a twelve to
four decision to a fine wrestler.
Albrecht this year has been sen-
sational coming off an injury
racked season last year. After a
broken leg, there was some
doubt if he would ever wrestle
again. But he came back at the
end of last year and is still one
of the best in the State.

Still remaining undefeated for
the Great Danes arc Larry
Mims. Walt Katz, and Rudy
Vido. Mims easily defeated his
opponent pinning him. Minis
seems to be the most consistent
wrestler on the squad either
pinning or nearly pinning every

Can you oldtimers out there
remember the Atlanta Braves
teams of the late 1960’s? The
Braves were always capable of
fielding hard-hitting lineups with
the likes of Hank Aaron, Rico
Carty, Joe

Torre and Ed
Matthews yet they never were

  

successive: week. this time tn

opponent. At this point he
seems to be our best bet iii the
SUNY's.

Walt Katz remained unbeaten
gaining a draw. After this match
Albany knew it was going to be
a real struggle. ('oacli Garcia and
Coach Peterson both remarked
that this would be a close match
based on Binghamtoii‘s past per-
formance. Rudy Vido kept his
unbeaten streak going the easy
way by wuining on a forfeit.
Sophomore Doug Baucr who
was moved brick to I77 against
()iiconta won at that weight
again. pinning his opponent.
Doug, who wrestled most of last
year ill l77 was moved down to
I07 this year. It is a cicdit to
hint that he can do .i lob at
either weight and not hurt the
team

For the rest of the team it was

able to win a single pennant. I
don't think it would be far
fetched in the least to liken
these same Brave teams to the
present Albany State swimming
team.

The Albany State swimming
team went on the road last
weekend for the second

     

 

 

an afternoon of dissapointment
as no one else could gain some
points. Dick Moody was shut
out, Ethan Grossmzin dccisioned,
and Albany, which usually is
leading at the half way point,
was trailing. The heavier weights
could not make up the differ-
once.

This Wednesday, Albany has
its first home match since Dec-
cmhcr In as they take on the
Grapplers from Fairleigh Dick~
cnson University. It promises to
be 'I tough match and a large
turnout could help the 3-2
grapplers obtain their fourth
win/I‘hc match is at 4:00 in the
gym. Saturday, the grapplcrs are
away again at (‘. W. Post with
Snuihtiiiiptoii. it will be another
tough one for a team that never
seciiis to get two easy ones in a
row.

Potsdam. The team bus carried
eight athletes to Potsdam which
isn't even enough to field a
baseball team much less a
collegiate swimming and diving
team. The Great Dane swimmers
were not unnerved by this fact.
If their performance can be used
to judge the morale of the team,
one would have to say the
swimmers were in great spirits.
The Albany swim team left Pots-
dam with ten new personal
records for its swimmers and
.wo varsity records.

Potsdam, the site of the meet
itself. is a strange place to say
the least The enrollment at this
school, located in the wilds of
Northern New York, is about
one third that of Albany's.
Nonetheless, the school has just
completed building an imprcs»
slvc athletic ficldhouse housing a
hockey rink, an indoor track and
a pool that dwarfs Albany‘s one.
'l'his great building spree has not
gone for nothing, for at the same
time l’olsrlam has fielded a
swunming team able to rival any
team in the SUNYAC,

'l‘lic Potsdam ti-ani‘s strength
was strongly in evidence on
Saturday when they defeated

the Great Dane swimmers.
However, one would never have
guessed the true outcome of the
meet from the expressions of
Coach Kelly and his swimmers at
the end of the meet. In both the
Individual Medley and the free-
style relay the swimmers
brought back to Albany new
school records. Len Van Ryn set
the new medley mark with it
time of 2:134. The freestyle
relay team of Tom Staples, Marc
Eson, Len Van Ryn, and Ken
Weber lowered the school's free-
style relay mark by four
seconds. At the same time, Jaik
Sliubcrt, Ken Weber, Marc Eson,
Les Puretz and Jeff Roscn could
all be pleased with setting new
personal records in their indivi-
dual events. The big guns of the
Albany swim team had
responded even stronger than
expected. However, Albany was
unable to return to school with
that much desired first win of

Lack of depth will not be a
suitable excuse for the Great
Dane swimmers this Wednesday,
however. That night the Univer-
sity Gym’s swimming pool will
be the site of the SUNYA

will face the swimming teams of
Buffalo and Binghamton. A win
here would go a long way in
relieving State’s second semester
