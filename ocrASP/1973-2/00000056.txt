Danes Make It “A Sweep;

by Bruce Maggin

What does it take to beat the
number three and four ECAC
Division 3 basketball teams,
Brockport and PotsdamI in one
week? It takes a determined
team with great team work plus
3,000 raving fans. With these
ingredients the Danes finished
their sweep with a hard fought
63-54 victory over Potsdam last
Saturday.

Albany won the game because
of the hard work under the
boards by the forward line of
Smith, Oirtiss and high leaping
Byron Mill'er. Even though Pots-
dam possessed a 6'7" center,
Albany still managed to out-
rebound the Bears 48 to 38.
Smith was particularly tough.

snaring 12 rebounds.

Maybe the real story of the
game was the fans. Another SRO
crowd stomped, clomped, and
cheered the Danes to their 25th
straight home victory. Potsdam’s
small delegation of fans gave the
Bears a good welcome but this
hardly compared to the rousing
standing ovation the Danes
received when they were intro-
duced.

Albany got off to an early 4-0
lead as Olﬂias and Miller both hit
ﬁeld goals. Potsdam was not able
to hit a field goal till more than
three minutes into the contest
and the Danes were able to open
up a ﬁve point lead. The Bear's
All-American candidate, Mike
Deane. proceeded to get hot.

canning four straight shots and
Potsdam was able to catch
Albany, 18-17. Good defense
was displayed by both sides.
Albany used a zone defense to
stop high scoring Potsdam.

Albany was able to forge ahead
with some big offensive
rebounding. Rpssi had his fine
touch, hitting four ﬁrst half bas-
kets. With less than a minute
remaining in the half Albany
once again tried to play for the
last shot. Just like the Brockport
game, the move backfired with
Potsdam’s Jerry Marks stealing
the ball and he went in for an
easy layup which Harry Johnson
goaltended. Never the less, the
Danes still took a 30-28 lead
into the lockerroom.

The Danes looked like they
were going to blast Potsdam
right off the court at the
beginning of the second half
with Miller and Smith hitting
buckets. The Bears still hung
close with center Ted Renee and
Deane leading a 9-2 spurt,
putting Potsdam into the lead
for the last time. As in the past,
Albany came right back. Smith
and Werner Kollin both
converted offensive rebounds
into baskets. Potsdam was
unable to score for four minutes
but Albany could not capitalize,
managing only one basket. The
teams each traded baskets twice.
Curtis converted a pretty Smith
pass to giVe the Danes a 54-49
lead. A shot by Deane narrowed
the lead to 3 when Albany took

Albany Pups Edge Rival Siena

by Nathan Salant

The Albany fans, who were
wise enough to come early for
the Potsdam basketball game
Saturday, were treated to a real
thriller as the Pups defeated
visiting Siena 71-64. The game
was not decided until the final
15 seconds of play. The game
was characterized by the Pups'
usual cold spells, but as usual,
they came alive when the chips
were down, and finished on top.

The game opened with Siena
winning the draw, and quickly
jumping ahead 40 With 4
minutes gone by, the Pups
rallied. Two baskets by Merritt,
two more by Alicea, and l by
Kapner put the Pups ahead by 5

Siena started closing the gap
Vlll 3 straight baskets by Jim
Scully The score was 21‘15,the
time 8.20, and the Pups leading,
when the pace of the game was
set. Siena crept to within 1 point
thanks to the red hot Pops
Clarke. Albany called a time
out to try to slow the pace, but
the effort was futile as Clarke hit
another basket when play
resumed and Siena lead by one.

Now the Pups came alive,
rattling off 5 straight points, but
than Albany went back to sleep
and Siena put 4 on the board.

PAGE TWELVE

When one of the Pups rolled
over in his sleep and committed
a foul at the buzzer, two more
Siena points resulted giving them
the lead.

The second half opened with
the Pups wide awake, and the
jump, the shot, and the basket
all went to Albany, as did the
lead, 32-31. Siena came right
back to nose ahead by 1, and the
next 8 minutes of play saw

single basket see-saw action.
Both sides got innumerable

breaks, and both sides took full
advantage of them.

Once again the team which
committed the violation or foul
would suffer, and once again it
was Siena who did both. A 3
second violation resulted in the
bull going over to Albany, who
gave it back to Siena, who gich
it back to our Pups, who finally
managed to lay It up and Ill. 'l‘hi-
Pups lead by fl, but Siena again
came back, as Tim Welt-horn;
sunk 2 for the Visitors rind pulled
them ahead 5554, with 6.50 to

go.

The third break went to
Albany, and if the saying that a
team makes its own breaks was
ever true, it occurred right then
and there. On a Siena break,
llich Kapner forced a jump bull,
won it and tapped to Eisenman.
who pulled the old give and go

with Alicea and the Pups lead
again. Next, Merritt forced an
offensive foul against Siena, hit
his two resulting free throws to
up the Pup lead. Twenty seconds
later, Alicea hit for two, and the
Pups led by 5.

The game was still within
Sienii‘s grasp, and they meant to
come back rind get it. Votara
closed the gap to 3 points with ii
short one, and when Albany

Danes. Albany marched up court
and scored twice, to lead 67-61
with 50 seconds left in the game.
Things looked good, but Siena

to 3 points, when Albany called
timeout with 16 seconds to go.
The pressure was on, and when
play resumed, Sienii had to give
ii foul to get possession. The
berge went to the line, hit one
and missing the second, but the
rebound went to Albany. Siena
was forced to foul again. This
time it was Merritt hitting for
two, stealing the inbounds pass,
and sinking one with 2 seconds
left to make the final score

off and hid. The Danes scored
seven straight points, five from
the foul line, to put the game
out of reach. With less than two
minutes to play, Dean fouled
out and the game for all inten-
sive purposes was over. In the
closing seconds, Doc Sauers gave
the subs their chance to play.
Terry 's shot at the buzzer sent
'the crowd home with their
63-54 victory,

A great deal must be said
about the Potsdam team. They
put up a good ﬁght even though
they were a tired bunch, having
beaten Oneonta the night
before. Deane was most impres-
sive taking game scoring honors
with 19 points.

But what about Albany? This

      

is the same team that lost to
Oneonta by 20 but best Brock-
port at home. The difference
appears to be those 3,000 fans.
The Danes have looked so good
at home but have been equally
bad on the road. Unless a
miracle happens, Albany is out
of SUNYAC contention with the
winner of the Brockport-Buffalo
game the champion. Albany’s
only hope is an zit-large bid to
the NCAA playoffs but they
must win the rest of their games,
including those on the road if
they are to be considered.
Albany fans can savor the past
week's victories but if the Danes
played up to their capabilities on
the road, Albany could be sitting
on top of the SUNYAC.

Fisher Gets Tough With RA’  

In a memorandum issued Wednesday afternoon, the Ofﬁce of Residences outlined its position
regarding the RA protest and work stoppage. The move came in response to repeated demands on the
part of the Resident Assistants for an increase in their remunerations--demands which crystallized last
week with the initiation ofjob action on lndian and Alumni to get any action on their grievance. By
demonstrating their discontent, the RA’s had hoped to open up meaningful negotiations with their
superiors. It didn’t work out that way. Meetings with Charles Fisher, Director of Residences, last week and
early this week yielded nothing. in light of this, the other three quads moved closer to joining the work-
