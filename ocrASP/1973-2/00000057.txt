by Patricia Grady

Are you looking for an exiting,
educational experience that iri-
cludes a tin-expenses. paid trip
to New York City? If you have
an interest in what'shappening
all over the world. then perhaps
you can have such an experience
by participating in the National
Model U.N.‘s annual conference
this April 14-29.

The N.M.U.N.. an inde-
pendent. student-run. non-proﬁt
organization. invites colleges
from all over the United States
to help stage a mock U.N. con-
vention. Each oftlre |28 partici-
pating schools comprise a delega-
tion for one nation. The pre-
tense. however. is quite exacting,
Not only are the 3 main councils

(General Assembly, Security

Council, and Economic and
Social Council) represented, but
the program's first phase pre-
conference research often iri-
cludes a briefing conducted by
the ambassador of your delega-
tion’s. country. The goal of this
preliminary phase is to acquaint
each delegate with the eco-
nomic, social. political and
cultural convictions of a citizen
of his chosen nation, In the
second phase, resolutions based
on this research are submitted to
the “Secretary General" who
will then compile the cori-
ference‘s agenda.

In between committee
meetings and the World (‘risis
discussions, time is given for

UNYA Future Dim for Goodman...

by Al Senia

The long and coinplex struggle
Assistant History Department
Professor David Goodman has
been waging for promotion and
tenure reached a dramatic con-
cltisiort earlier this week when
the University S‘entite Council on
Promotion and Continuing
Appointment voted to deny him
botli promotion and tenure,

The UniversilyCounciI is one of
the last significant hurdles in the
tenure process. The case now
goes to Vice President Philip
Sirotkin and President Louis
Benczet for discussion. It is ex-
pected that they will uphold the
('outicil decision.

The action significantly thins
chances that the popular but
controversial history teacth wrll
return to the lIIIIVL'IsIly to teach
next scmcslcr Ilis bid for con-
tinuing appointrncnt \\tl\ rc-
icclcd last year,

(ioodinan sccmcd surprised .rr

hearing the pcssiirnstrc vcrdrct
that seemed to confirm the

 

worst expectations of many of
his supporters. “This place is
crazy," Goodman said. “They
change the standards (for pro-
motion and tenure) from year to
year and they change the stan-
dards frorri person to person."

Goodman had made a half
hour presentation to the com-
mittee to plead his case.

It is a case that has dragged on
for some two years up through
the multi-Itiyered bureaucracy.
Goodman and his supporters,
unlike severer other faculty
members who have faced similar
battles to remain in teaching
positions at the university, shied
away from massive pirblicity
campaigns and angry studcrit
political movements. They opted
for a rtrorc subdued. personal
approach and concentrated their
efforts on lobbying With

I.cy university L‘HIIIIliIllL't's.
nrcctrng \yrth titiIVL‘Istty admin-
stratois. including l’tcstdcnt
Ilene/cl .rrrd attempting to
apply external pressure through

SUNY Central Administration.
In short, it was an approach

that stressed working within the

established framework.

To many of Goodman‘s sup~
porters, it must have scented
that approach has been ti dismal
failure thus far.

Two bids for proriiotion and
tenure have been unsuccessful
and an attempt to gain con-
tinuing appointment (term re-
newal) was shot down by the
history department last year. A
Irearing before a Senate grie-
vance committee yielded little iii
the way of positive results.

Now there are signs the tactics
are changing. The key question
for Goodman is whether or not
these newly promised cl'loris
Will be too little, too late.

Student backers oi (ioodnran

\llltlL‘IIl support rootcd. they
hope, in the lllllltllt‘tls oi \lll‘

Llil\\cs wtlltrrr the past scvcral
scrncstcrs. Undergraduate stu
dent Rick Ginsberg. who has

been involved with the case since
its outset is hopeful students will
flock to Goodman's tattered
banner once they realize the
injustices his supporters argue
are inherent in his case.

Ginsberg also plans to air the
case before sympatheticmembers
of the New York State Legis-
lature is the hopes substantial
outside pressure can be applied
to administrative officials at the
university.

And Goodman's supporters are
hopeful that Central Admini~
strators in the SUNY system will
come to the aid of the be-
lcagured assistant professor. Vice
Chancellor McKenzie was
appraised of the status of the
case tit a rct'ciil meeting and
promised tlrc students he would
