Uptown Shuttle Bus... Only Seven Minutes?

By Jerry Goldhagen

Here, there, and everywhere,
but not a shuttle bus to ride on.
That seems to be one of the
major complaints concerning the
uptown tin-campus sltuttle bus
service. There are others. if you
happen to be one of llrc many
people who are totally confused
about when, where. and how to
use the shuttle bus to their best
advantage, then read on.

According to reliirblc sources,
the uptown shuttle bus service is
designed to alleviate parking
problems at SUNYA. Tn rrclricve
this rtoblc goal, SUNYA has
been utilizing two xlruttlc buses
simultaneously since the bcgin-
rring of the academic year. Tltc
only exceptions are dtrrirrg the
two coffcc breaks turd uric lunclr
brcuk L‘tlt‘ll drry, when only one
bus is upcrrrting. Theoretically, it
ltrlltiws llrul this syslcrn slruuld
provrdc u bus within seven
mrrrutcs :rrtywlrcr'c on tho shuttle
rtrtllc.

It sounds simple enough.
There should be no apparent
reasons for the shuttle service
not to work smoothly and efﬁ-
ciently. Right? Wrong! Accord-
ing to one of the friendly and
talkative drivers, “Our services
are not being used to full poten-
tial. Mostly the secretaries use us
to get from their Cars to the
podium and back ugtrin."

Bccrrusc of this situation, prrrk-
irrg on the uptown campus has
persisted its tr major problem.
Officials have not yet forgotten
the student parking strike of not
tun long ago in addition, now
than wintcr has arrived. l‘cwcr
