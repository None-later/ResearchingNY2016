‘Governor Rockefeller began
his testimony last week to the
combined Assembly Senate and
Codes Committee.

The open hearing was held for
those legislators and citizens
who wanted to hear the Cover-
nor explain his program which
will amend the Penal Law in
order to make life sentence man-
datory for all pushers. i

The Governor pointed out that
his basic objective was to deter
people from addiction and to
put a halt to the trafficking of
drugs through pushers. thus al—
leviating crime in the streets. He
felt, as many Citizens do. that
something definitely has to be
done to help those innocent
victimized people. The big ques-
tion is whether or not his pro
gram is an answer.

One important recommenda-
tion was made by an Assembly
Codes committee member. The
life sentence for an addict and
pushers may be an effective
means of preventing crime
caused by pushers and those
addicted, but this still leaves an
open gap where crime is induced
and caused for other reasons.
Therefore by adventing the life
sentence for all serious crimes:
(robbery. assault) the gap be-
comes filled with equal preven-
tion laws. Consequently this was
probably one of the most
brought-up points during the
hearing. Such a situation would
be the housewife who gave a
couple of her diet pills to a
friend and thus would be eligible
under Rockefeller's program to a
minimum of twenty years with
no chance of plea bargaining or
parole. But while still under the
Governor's program. the holder
of leg.) 15 ounces of any hard
drugs and straight cannabis
would not undergo such severe
penalities of life sentence and no
parole.

The fact here is that under the
Control Substances Act enacted
last year. a pound or more of
any classification of hard drugs
shall be listed as criminal posses
sion in the first degree, This
possvsion of anything less than
a pound is only a misdemeanor
or Class E felony. However sel-
ling or giving drugs ofany (yuan
tity would result in a 1st degree
charge.

The Governor expressed sur-
prise to this fact and referred
back to the housewife saying
that without prescription for sel-
ling, "she runs the risk."

Senator Berstein (33rd Dis~
trict, Bronx) raised a point to
the effect that drug users don‘t
rob. assault, or murder while
under the influence of drugs. but
after. In other words, prevention
laws based on the addiction of
the robber or assailant would
not apply.

The Governor answered by‘
pointing out that while it is true
that heroin addicts obtain a pla-
cid state upon usage developing
a “nod” and statistically don’t
commint crimes while actually
experiencing the drug; for the
L.S.D.. hashish, and other hard
drug users this is not true. These
hard drug users may rob and
murder while under the influ-
ence of that drug.

“This law does not punish the
addicts but the addict pusher."

Although the Governor made
the above statement, there is no
inclination based upon his pro-
gram that this is true.

A hypothetical situation was
directed to the Governor from
Sen. Manford Ohrenstcin (27th
District).

It involved three men. each of
thirty years of age. that while
driving, hit and killed someone:
one driVer under the influence of
narcotics, the other affected by
liquor. and the last an intention-
al murder.

[t is interesting to note that
under Rockefellcr's program the
second and third driVers would
be eligible for release from any-
where from five to ten years.
But the first driver on narcotics
would be sent up for life im-
prisonment without a cliancc of
a lessened sentence or parole
The Governor then was asked if
the first man’s lawyer asked for
executive clemency. what would
he do'.’ Rockefeller replied. “I
would not be here."

The Governor's hard stand on
the drug pusher and addict is in
direct contrast with his proposed
“War on Drugs" with the Narv
cotics Addiction Control Com-
mission. menioncd in his state-
ments in 1961i and (57. However.
as the Governor said 'I‘uesday “I
have made mistakes. but that is
no reason to throw up your
hands and say that nothing is

effective.” “They can make new
addiCts faster than we Can treat
them." Consequently to add to
the establishment of this pro-
gram is guaranteeing a $1000.00
reward leading to the arrest and
conviction of a pusher. 100% tax
on all monies or property ac-
quired through convictions of
trafficking of drugs. 100 tempor-
ary judges for the sole purpose
of easing-up court congestion
dealing with Cases of drug users.
and complete alleviation of fi-
nancial responsibility to local

Other Interesting Aspects

The most imporant non-legal
point brought up was by Assem'
blyman Arthur Eva (lrlllrd Dis-
trict. Buffalo) who is on the
Governor's shit list and
viceversa. Eve said that the bill
would create havoc in the ghetto
tnicknamcd “Ghetto Genocide
Bill"). The bill is mainly ghetto
orientated. for this is where the
‘junkic'. pushch and addicts are
concentrated.

There is little argument that
something definitely has to be
done for thc victimich person.
Whether or not the program of
Governor Itockcfcllcr's will be-
come the shining star for New
York State or another stench in
the backlogs of the Governor
and Illt' legislature will remain to
be sci-n ~ as the program bill will
soon cross the Jagged and treach-
erous terrain of the Asst-mlin
and Senate.

For The Governor

Spedd to the ASP

A small. but united ad hoc
gathering of 35 Working class
and student activists from the
Albany area staged a picket line
demonstration outside thr-
Washington Avenue Armory on
Tuesday evening. February 6th.
The purpose was to protest the
speaking appearance inside of
New York Governor Nelson
Rockefeller. before a black tic
dinner of the State’s Chamber of
Commerce. The affair was staged
mainly to give Rocky an
opportunity to convince his
business culprits of the viability
of his recently proposed. rcers-
sive narcotics control legislation
though also. he must have cer-
tainly praised the work of the
Warsaw. N.Y. grand jury in its
work of handing down criminal
indictments on the Attica
brothers. The pickctrng began
outside the armory entrance at
around ti o'clock P.M., one hour

700 Hear E

by Steve Meyer
Special to the ASP

Have you ever wondered about
the seemingly strange events sur-
rounding the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy in
November, 1963? Well, a com-
puter systems graduate student
named Robert Saltzman has
spent 6 years making an ex-
haustive investigation of those 6
seconds in Dallas, and spent al-
most 5 hours last Wednesday
nite holding an overflow Stand-
ing Room Only crowd of 600 in
LC-7 on the edge of their seats.
His presentation of slides, films.
and the famous Zapruder movie
of the assassination weaves an
elaborate tapestry of a complex.
thrilling. and frightening story of
conspiracy.

The ﬁrst bombshell Saltzman
laid on the audience was his
initial statement that Lee Harvey
Oswald (lid not fire a singlcshol
that day; and that Sirhan Sirhan
did not kill Robert Kennedy. as
well as Martin Luther King being
killed by someone other than
James Earl Ray. Bill those other
assassinations arc sttiril‘s unto
themselves; Saltzman plunged
directly into his wild and often
unbelievable. but chillingly

from his throat, strike Texan
Governor John Connally in the
seat in front in the right shoul-
der. pass through his right wrist.
and lodge in the upper thigh of
his right leg. This one bullet had
to inflict all that damage. since it
was the only one left.

Robert Saltzman in a lengthy
and graphic showing to the
audience of the eyewitness Zap-
ruder film. clearly showed that
Connally was not struck until
almost 2 whole seconds after
Kennedy had been visibly hit.
Additionally. the alignment of
the bodies of Kennedy and Con-
nally would have the bullet tra-
veling a zig-zag, up and down
course totally iit odds with basic
theories of motion of a pro-
jectile. The audience clearly saw
that the same bullet could noy
have hit both men. The reali-
zation that the official govern-
ment report was a blatant and
possibly ill-liberate lie galvanized
the crowd and spurred Saltzman

the grassy knoll in front of
Kennedy’s car. “ From the re-
peated and close-up showings of
the Zapruder film, we see Ken-
nedy struck by 2 seperate bul-
lets, then Connally hit, and
ﬁnally the fatal head shots del-

ivered by 2 of the gunmen. As

the Warren Commission stated.
the fatal blow was from the rear.
as Oswald was behind the car.
The film does show Kennedy's
head lurch forward. but only for
a split second. and then snap
violently backwards, this action
supposedly from a rear shot.
Saltzman believes that his shot
number 5 was from the Dallas
Textile Building (from the rear)
aan arrived almost simulta-
neously with shot number 0.
from the grassy knoll in front.
Both these bullets impacted
upon the President‘s head, but
the greater force and direction
of the closer shot from the
grassy knoll literally blew out
Kennedy's brains. anrl threw him
back into the arms of his wife.
who was in back of him. The
Commission said that Kennedy
fell backwards from a complex
neurological contraction after
the rear shot hit him; Saltzman
cites a Secret Service agent in

blood and brains from what the
Commission said was a shot

through Kennedy. then through
3 parts of Connolly’s body,
lodge in his thigh. and then be
found completely intact on Ke-
nnedy's stretcher seems to be
beyond explanation by the es-
teemed Warren Commission.
And to add insult to injury, the
Commission conducted ballistics
tests and the same type of bullet
fired at the same range through
the wrist of a cadaver was almost
totally destroyed from the im-
pact. Yet. this “magic bullet"
went through 2 men in 4 places
and came out with no more than
a few scratches. Believe it or not,
the Commission fired a bullet
through a pile of cotton .and the
bullet was clearly disfigured!

Saltzman hypothesizes that the
“magic bullet" was fired into
Kennedy's back from the distant
DalvTex building. From precise
positions of the car from the
Zapruder film. the ass 'sin in the
Dal-Tex building was aiming di-
rectly at the back of the Pre-
sident’s head, and the distance
involved caused the bullet to
drop to enter with low velocity
into Kennedy's back. This bullet
penetrated only 2 or 3 inches
and fell onto the stretcher after
heart massage and an emergency
trachiotomy were performed in
the hospital‘s Trauma Room.

the weirder theories of cori-
spiracy. although strange. some
are very plausible. From thr-

nedy’s head off! There is also a
man on the other side of the
street with a sign that he never
holds up until the car speeds
away with the dead President.
The sign says: S.O.B. Kennedy,
The sign man then shows the
sign in all directions and then
calmly walks away! Meanwhile.
the umbrella man has folded his
umbrella and calmly walks off as
hysterical people rush in all di-
rections about him. Saltzman’s
conjecture is that the umbrella
man signalled both the com-
mencement and stoppage of the
ﬁre, and the sign man reported
to the gunmen that they had
done their job well. This was to
signal off a second team of
assassins that Saltzman said
lurked a mile down the road!

Then, there’s the Dallas police-
man that wasn't really a Dallas
policeman; a photo exists of a
man dressed as a cop with the
wrong badge, the wrong shoes.
and a microphone in his ear!
This man is also seen in a much
earlier photo of Kennedy at the
Dallas airport. Saltzman believes
that a massive conspiracy,
known to J. Edgar Hoover and
perpetuated by the C.I.A.. killed
Kennedy after he found out
about a secret second invasion of
Cuba planned by the CIA and
vowed to “crush the CIA into a
million little pieces," Apparent-
ly. says Sallzman. they returned
the compliment.

Finally. we have the known
information that Lee Oswald
was an informer paid and em-
plovcd by the government agon-
l'_\' Oswald was definitely sci up

spiracy. When he was about to
