FEBRUARY 9, 1973

 

by BJ Chall

It has been said quite often
0115! Counting the times I read
aloud my rough drafts) that
working on the technical staff of
a newspaper is cut. and dried. If.
is true that the. Albany Student
Press has more than its share of
razor blades, but. it is a com-
plete misstatement to say
that the production room lacks
humidity. Humility, perhaps.
With all the sweat that. goes into
each issue one could construct
an artificial lake to supply water
and salt for the entire Capital
District (excluding Menunds, of
course).

You may be wondering what
kind of person joins a technical
staff of a newspaper. Here at the
ASP We have a compulsive paper
eater, three escaped convicts
from a road gang in Georgia
(chains intact), a sophomore
that thinks he's a T square (we
only keep him on because he's
so straight), and a streetcar
named Desire. What kind of pa-
per brings together such diverse
people, you ask. (l‘ll bet you
didn't know that the ASP was
two-way, did you?) That's a
good question.

When a lcch worker has been
with the paper for six months
his name is pul into a pool. if
the name flmlls, we drown the
worker. (Until now the requisi-
tion for three acres of lead foil
has gone unexplained). If there
is a vacancy in the position of
Technical Editor or Associate
Technical Editor, all of the sur-
viving tech workers are put into
a draft. The first one to sneeze
fills the position. 01‘ course,
lhcre is no refusing. The last one
in refuse the position of Asso-
cialc 'l‘vchnit‘al Editor was later
involved in lhl' Armor Meal
scandal (very deeply involved, I
might add). And once you're in,
that's it.

The paper itself is conceived
days in advance when llll' Adver-
Lising Manager receives the Ads
for the paper. While she claims
to he strivmg for increased rev-
enue, she secretly gloals over all
the extra pages that she, single-
handedly caused the entire tech
stuff to labor ovvr. When told
that there was not enough news
copy to fill the pages she assign-
ed, shr- was heard to scream (in
twelve states) “1 don't care!
More Smokey Bear!" Sic was

Tecli lr 2: leave It
or Hard ASP: at the Time

fond of rhyming couplets and
Public Service Ads as filler.

The excitement begins when
the editors try to determine the
length of their stories. It was the
middle of last semester that one
of the news editors submitted
Les Miserables to ﬁll a space
four inches by five inches. The
only time the Editors would out
anything from a story is if it
were on fire. On other occas-
sions, when a single headline is
supposed to fill a full page, we
have smokey bear and some
movie star telling us to fight.
cancerous forest fires. The hus-
band who rearranges an apart-
ment until his wife is satisfied
with the placement of the piano
does not. know what it is like to
move a story (in several pieces
already), to cut it up again to
make it fit a new space, and to
move it a third time, keeping
everything perfectly parallel, and
listening to the editor exioll the
cuteness of the headline (if it is
written before 2 AM). It. finally
gets done, but the conditions are
such that there is a constitu-
tional lest planned in the Sup-
reme Court (is Tech Cruel or
Unusual punishmenu?)...

Each year, when the Editor-in-
Chief takes his oath of office on
a copy of Newsdny, he tradition-

ally gives a State of the ASP
speech. This year, the Editor was
elected when he was (not sur-
prisingly) out of the country.
(There were those who suggested
that he fill his term in abstentia.
No one knew where it was.)
However, by default, last year's
motto still remains...“l’lus La
Change!" is written in invisible
ink on page 4 of each Aﬂ’, And
there’s change. Last May an edi-
tor suggested that page one be
printed in reverse - white on
black. Last month, an editor
suggested little drawings in the
upper left hand corner of the
ASP, and as the reader ﬂipped
through the pages, it. would look
like a movie. “We can show
coming attractions that. way!"
he said. We couldn't tell him
that there are no edges on the
upper left.

But still Tech endures. Editors
may come and go, and there
may be issues with no copy
whatsoever, but there’ll always
be a tech staff. Similarly, there
will always be prickly heat... No
one wants a bald head, but. no
one wants to lOSe one. And
finally, and this is a fact that few
remember in times of stress;
“Where else can you get tech—
nical-er in black and while?"

Dear Disgusted,

1 think your best alternative
would be for you to sit down
with your roommate and bring
the issues out, into the open.
inform her of the things she's
done that. have irked you and
point out how her incessant
complaining has irritated your
entire suite as well. Be gentle
and tactful, for you do have to
live with this girl for the rest. of
the semester.

However, if this action on your
part proves to be fruitless, it will
then be necessary for the entire
suite to discuss their grievances
with your roommate, for this
would probably be more effec-
tive than simply having you talk
Lo her. But action of this sort
should only be used as a last
resort, for your roommate is
going to feel like she is being
“ganged up on“, and this is
bound to cause a certain amount
of ill feeling between her and the
rest of the suite.

Dear "Auk the Asp."

This past December, I was
dating someone from R.P.l. We
saw each other for abOut a
month. He wrote to me once
over intersession and seemed to
be still interested in continuing
our relationship. Now, R.P.l. has
been in session almost two
weeks, and I haven't heard from
him yet this semester. I can't._
understand it and I don't know
what to think or do.

Dear B.E.,

Perhaps the best solution is to
try and forget this guy. He has
had ample time to get in touch
with you, if he wanted to. How-
ever, if you are someone who
finds that “not knowing" is
worse than knowing the truth,
we suggest that you call him.
That way, you should at least
hear the reasons for his actions
and thus know where you stand.
Don’t think of it as humbling
yourself: it is for your own
peace of mind.
