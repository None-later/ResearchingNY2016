Our Job is '
Serving Ourselves

To the editor:

I read Mr. Colon’s remarks about the
University Bookstore (ASP, Jan. 30) with
both anger and amusement. Who is he to
dictate how many books a professor may
begin his course with?0fcourse, the
alleged increased efficiency of the Book-
store might be further enhanced if Mr.
Colon would cut down the number of
book-orders allowed from three to zero.

Judging from my own experience, he
might as well. Many of the students in
one of my classes still cannot purchase the
one textbook assigned for the course. I
ordered the correct number but the
Bookstore apparently saw fit to cut it
down. In fact. in eVery semester in recent
memory the Bookstore has screwed up at
least one of my orders in one way or
another. The Bookstore serves itsell',not
the students. It remains what it has been
for all too long: a disgrace.

I propose instead a series of “dubious
achievement awards." Let each student
submit the names of the worst teachers
he has had (with or without reasons).
Then let the ASP publish the names of
the “winners” and five runners-up in
every department. Then we will at last
have something of real value for the
SUNY student.

It's About Space!

To the editor:

It's about time! Two and a half years
after its inception, the Five Quad Ambu«
ance Service is finally getting undl'I‘Wily.

Mr. Balslikoff is to be applauded for his

unwaivering determinism to push for a

campus ambulance servrcc. Although I

feel somewhat badly for Mr. Opal's prr

tcntial loss of income. I woultl hope that
no one would ever find themselves in
need of his services.

One point in the article deserves Cllirlfl'
cation. Dr. Hood is cited as stating that
"the average time of arrival was ten
minutes" for a commercial ambulance to
:lrrivr- at the plum where it was needed.

in the form of a phone call or a knock at

Last year, the fiscal situation eliminated
a chance for negotiating remuneration.
What do we have this year7ReBldent
Assistants presently receive roomI the
price of which is $650 per year. On a
weekly basis, that is $20. This is the
lowest remuneration ever received at this
University by Resident Assistant staff.
With no major job responsibility changes
prior to January 1973, it. does not seem
equitable to the present Resident Assis-
tants to pay them 1/3 of the previous
salary. Nor does it seem fair to do the
same in the future.

About 1/3 of all the Resident Assistanw
this year must hold second jobs to fin-
ance their education. One would think
that their performance as a Resident
Assistant would be impeded by this. But
the staff was still sitting duty, responding
to emergencies, attending staff meetings,
working with other students, and assisting
in residence administration. This indeed
has been quite a strain and has resulted in
disgust with the remuneration of this year
as well as that offered for next year by
the present staff.

What the Resident Assistants need is
your support since they are working for
the students of this Univvrsity, We wish
to persuade the University administration
to pay us a remuneration commensurate
with the involvement in the duties and
responsibilities of being it Resident. Assis-
tant.

no one would have to worry about the $2
service charge if there was no furniture
that didn’t belong in their room.

And what, pray tell, is wrong with the
suite system?" communications between
you and other students is lacking so
much. you should be grateful for the
suite system-at least you have three
friends.

Also, Mr. Pavlis, you say that "everyone
on Colonial knows that the food is much
better on Dutch Quad”. I wouldn't say
that. And I have eaten at Dutch many
times (or maybe I was just lucky and hit
good nights-all 20 of them).

You also claim an investigation is need-
ed in the cafeteria. For one so strongly
opposed to investigations it seems rather
strange that you would contradict your-
self this way.

You say you’ve liver. on Colonial Quad
for four years. If you've despised it so
much, why didn’t you move?

I’ve only lived here since the beginning
or the fallsemeiter and I love it. I don't
believe I’ll be complaining in my senior
year.

For you, John J. Pavlis, I sincerely hope
that after graduating you'll find all illi-
riches in the world, so you’ll be able to

build your very own Utopia!

Telephone basic service charges will be

to any earlier system, but rooiil charges
will be raised fifty dollars per student per
year to compensate.

Housing has also announced more lcn-

Apathy is Here i ‘
But I Don't Care

by Mitchell Frost

A few issues back I alluded to a trend
here at State. a trend l labeled "apathy"
though now, after further thought, I see
that “apathy” does not even come close
to describing the way so many of my
fellow students feel.

It is impossible for me to analyze the
current academic and social lethargy as an
outsider for the very reason that lam not
unaffected by the forces (whatever they
are) which have brought about this con-
dition, Whatever it is that is disturbing
students is disturbing me as well. What I
write. then. can be looked upon as being
both critical and subjective. It affects us
all.

Sincc much of the "involvement" that
was in lad during the tiU's and early 70's
ccitlt'rcd around the war in Victnurn It
comes as no surprise that With the “wt
riding-down” oi the Will ilicrc should also
be a “winding-down" of opposition to
the war And lo the extent that the War
served as a calalyﬂ for other issues
(abortion. niariJliana. etc) it was to be
expected that the "involvement syll-
diolilc" not outlive the issue which
tlcalcd ll.

Bill I do nol grieve for the fallen
demonstrations or arty of the other manl-
tcslallons of the activist era." (jood
