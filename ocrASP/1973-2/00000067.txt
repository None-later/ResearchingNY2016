Wrestlers To Victory

Rudy LTH‘Ll to power his way,
instead of wrestling, during the
first period and it was scoreless.
Both wrestlers showed little
wrestling in the second With
Rudy staying on top and picking
up riding time, His opponent
finally escaped and Rudy found
himself heliind.’l‘hc filial period
was almost the same after Rudy
escaped to tie up the malt-h.
Action was so iion-I-XIstcnl tlial.
lioth wrestlers were penalized
for the lack of action. Rudy,
though, knew he l‘()Lll(l sit and

by Bill Heller

Many 'weeks and twenty-five
basketball games ago, the
Albany, Great Dimes started
against the University of
Buffalo, by whipping the Bulls
7661. The tradition was- home
court supremacy, and it involved
winning big,
games against the likes of
Buffalo State and Brockport. On
Wednesday night, the University
of Buffalo ended that tradition,
76-62.

UB, unlike the mere claims of

hard~to~helicve

Siena, are bigtime. They have

played Niagara (narrowly los

ing), have beaten Georgm $1.,

Cornell, Brown, and this Sunday

will play the University of Mary-

land - the same Maryland that is
one of the best teams in the
nation,

Besides their reputation, the
Bulls had 6'6", 250 lbs. of Curtis
BIat-kmore, their all time leading
rclitiunder and a real tank under
the boards. Their high scorer was
li‘lt" lliirace Brawley, a flashy
forward with a 16.1 average.
Rounding out the front line was
(3‘6" Jim Triblile, hitting at 10.8

anti Ii'il" guard, completed the
offense With a 1:3 K norm. Also
to see action would he a it'll"
aiitl another ti't‘i" forward. In

other words ‘ a BIG team.

Gaing for the Dar

   

ies was their

    

Dd’ht-i

home win streak. and a lot of
momentum. Albany had just
knocked off Brockport and Pets
dam, and found themselves
ranked 2nd in the state (college
division).

The game started evenly, but
by the 10:00 mark, the Danes
had opened up a 21-16 edge

Then. dynamite. Bob Rossi
canned 3 buckets to cut it back
to 9 with 11:00 left. Bob Curtiss
scored ‘ Byron hit a jumper and
a tap. Now it was 57-54. The
crowd was wild, expecting ano-
ther Albany miracle, as the clock
:howed 8:00.

UB opened it to 62-54, but
’h'och and Rag hit to pull the
Danes within four. Vartanian
scored a lay-up and Reggie
fouled out. With 5:00 to go the
Danes trailed 65-58, but again
refused to quit. ’I'rot‘h hit a
Jumper, but it was Albany‘s last
gasp. Vartanian scored 3 more
lay ups and the streak was over.

Twenty-ﬁve in a row.

The difference in the end was
size, certainly not desire. Witness
Harry Johnson, who had magni-
ficent spurts in the 2nd half and
chipped in 5. Curtis, Smith.
Miller, Kolln, and Johnson all
did as well as could be expected
against the Buffalo giants. Braw-
ley and Vartanian combined for
44 points, and Tribble and
Blackmore owned thw‘f’uoards.
The most interesting states was
the foul shooting: Albany four
for eight, UB eighteen for thirty-
«three there's the 14 point
margin. It was defeat, but it was
defeat in style. “To give your
best, even in defeat. What more
can one ask?"
