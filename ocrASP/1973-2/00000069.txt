Alumni Assam nan,

Keeps Alumni in Touch with SUNYA

by Ronnie Fallon

The undergraduate’s under-
standing of the word“alumni" is
often nothing more than a vision
of a faceless crowd. Very few of
us are aware of the varied his-
tories and accomplishments of
the alumni. We assume that most
of them are teachers since
Albany was first and foremost a
teachers' college.

However, before we investigate

~,,,.r-,

The numbers have been reversed, but

are only 29,000 living alumni of
SUNYA.

Tire director of the Alumni
Association, David W. Jenks
(Class of ‘64), was asked to
describe the alumni. He replied,
“While it is hard to characterize
the alumni as a group, it is save
to say that they form the lead-
ership in New York State Secon-
dary Education is a way un-
matched by any college or univ-
ersity. They have distinguished

\llll retain an interest in the

development of the University,
chieﬂy because of the influence
and experiences it has provided
for them in their own lives.

There are no firm statistics as
to the breakdown of alumni by
occupation. A majority of the
alumni are involved in education
at some level, whether it be
teaching, administration, or
counselling. This is, of course, to
be expected since Albany was a
teachers‘ college. However, hun-
dreds of the Alumni have dis-
tinguished themselves by pur-
suing variorrs careers in the pro-
fessions and in business.

When asked about the attitude
of the Alumni towards the uni-
versity. the Alumni staff stated
that in some cases the alrrrrinr
have a hard triire relating to the
new campus. This is understand-
able considcring that many had
previously not kept in touch

brace the stereotyped image of
the students. They have a more
realistic View of today‘s carripus
life. primarily because iriairy of
tlicrii are involved in education.
Mr. Jenks stated that "The al-
ttriiirr til the university are

President Millard Fillmore. She
taught in Buffalo High School
and was First Lady of the White

istratioti.

Vincent Julian Donehue (class

American Theatre: he directed
‘Surrrise at (‘anipobello’ for both

president of the Southern Tier
Sales Executive Club, he helped
develop professional marketing
standards. He is currently a
member of the Alumni Asso-

Kate Stoneman (class of 1866)
was awarded for her pioneering
in the legal profession...the first
woman graduate of Albany Law
School and the first woman law-
yer in New York State. A special
law was passed in order for her
to be admitted to the bar. She
was an ardent suffrage worker
and taught at SUNYA for 29
years.

Of course, this is only a small
sampling of the Alumni’s acc-
omplishments. The reputation of
the University has beneﬁted
from ilrc accorriplrsliments ofits
aluirinr. These sketches have
omitted many fine educators
and numerous other achievers
for lack of space.

So we see that the function of
the Alumni Association is to
keep the Alumni in touch with
the University, as well as supply
botli the university and alumni
with certain services.
