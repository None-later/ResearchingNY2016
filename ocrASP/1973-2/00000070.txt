When Curtis Smith 0fth€
English department began the
long procedure of securing ten-
ure, he had few qualms. He was
assured by many of his most
respected colleagues that there
would be little question of his
succeeding, it was simply a mat-
ter of patience. "

So when DonaldSMUfZQI, the
acting-Chairman of the English
department, issued his ofﬁcial
statement that he was not re-
commending Smith for tenure,
many people were surprised The
teaSons‘ for his decision were even
more surprising: he claimed that
Smith was a “divisive force“
within the department.

The argument boils down to a
difference of opinion about just
what constitutes a healthy, pro-
ductive department. Stauffer ap-
pears to advocate a harmonious
fellowship of gentleman-
scholars, while Smith contends
that such harmony is false and
stagnating. “A department (or
society) in which respectful,
honest debate cannot be waged
cannot be expected to grow," he
says.

In the letter of transmittal
which accompanies the chair-
man's full report. Stauffer ad-
mitted that Smith was qualified
in the fiife areas recommended
in the Guidelines Concerning
Promotions in Ran/ed and Crui-
(inning Appointment, and for
good reason: V
Smith has attained an impres-
sive reputation in the field of
science fiction lie was asked to
hectth a founding incinhci of
the Science Fiction Research As-
sociatioii, and was recently re:
quested to contribute to a hook
on science fiction by Dr. liikc

Curl Smith: A “dwisrve force?”

Barmeyer of Germany. He has
written and published numerous
articles on the subject, and has
spoken at a number of forums
and conferences.

-His teaching ability, based on
student evaluations, is very high-
ly rated. In his AfrotAmerican
Literature and Science Fiction
classes over the past three sem-
esters, 85% of his students rated
Smith as excellent or very good,
15% rated him good, and 4%
rated him fair or poor. In
response to the question, “Does
the instructor make students feel
free to ask questions, disagree,
express opinions, etc.?” 81%
rated him as excellent, 15% as
very good, and only 4% in the
last 3 categories.

Dr. Stauffer have refused 1,,
recommend Smith?

one reason may he that the
department Vote on Smith't tt-n
ure was not unanimous. its tmd.
ition dictates. The ftr\l Wile
showed an even split pro and
con. However, when the second
vote was taken, he was appoved
by a 2-to-1 margin. A possibility
for the chairman‘s hesitaiicy is
suggested by his breakdown or
the vote-first the total vote (35
to 19), and then the vote minus
the student representation (33
to 19). Students on the l2nglisli
department committee are \Up‘
posed to have equal \l.llll\ Dr
Stauffer has subtly littllt‘tilctl
otherwise.

-Uni\’ersity Service has been an
integral part of (‘urt Smith'slife
at SUNYA. He has at various
points been a draft counselor.
chairman of the board of dir-
ectors for the Peace Project,
chairman of the Committee on
Academic Freedom and Griev-
ances, on the faculty advisory
committee for the English de—
partment and faculty advrsor for
PARSEC, a science fictioti mag-
azine. He is currently involved in
a project to transport people in
the Albany community to Visit
iclativcs in prison.

The area of Continuing
Growth is perhaps Smith's
strongest. He pioneered the es-
tablishment of science fiction at
SUNYA. with little prior study
of the stthlccl, and educated
himself to his present level iii

he was asked to pilot the then»
