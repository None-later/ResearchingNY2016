“But once on the plane they were shaking hands, hugging each other and hugging the nurses. I told
theml‘WVelcome home, glad to see you."’l‘hey replied to me, “You bet."

Abel said that on the 21/3-hourﬂight to the Philippines, the men asked what they could eat, talked
about politics, women's fashions and sports, and read the Stars and Stripes, the military newspaper.

In Saigon twenty-seven happy but haggard-looking American prisoners of war arrived yesterday, freed
from Viet Cong captivity after a last-day dispute that delayed their release by l 1 hours.

Paper name tags pinned' to their shirts ﬂopped in the wind as the ex-POWs emerged from the six
helicopeters that brought them the 75 miles from Lee Ninh, north of Saigon.

The first prisoner to come out of the helicopters in Saigon was a young man on a stretcher covered
with a gray blanket. Although he appeared ill, he raised himself up and smiled and waved to a crowd of
about 75 that cheered and whistled.

Twenty-ﬁve other prisoners, most in baggy blue and gray fatigues and sandals, walked pasta receiving
line shaking hands with US. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and Gen. Frederick C. Weyand, commander
of US. forces in Vietnam, before boarding a rear entrance to the aircraft.

A, US. Embassy ofﬁcial said the 27th released prisoner, Richard Waldhaus, ofPittsburgh,California,
had requested to be taken to the Saigon Army Hospital and would be taken there.

Little is known of Waldhaus, a civilian. His presence in Vietnam was not widely known until his name
turned up on a Viet Cong radio broadcast last October, announcing his capture on Aug. 4, 1971.

The prisoners arriving in Saigon looked thin and tired, but most smiled broadly as they walked across
the floodlit landing apron.

  

Some of the men carried black plastic bags containing a few belongings brought With them from
captivity, One prisoner was wearing a yellow baseball cap.

The receiving group walked to the front of the plane to welcome the man on the stretcher and then
returned to the rear entrance where they cliallcd with each man, slapping a few on the back and giving
them a 1i le push up the stairs.
