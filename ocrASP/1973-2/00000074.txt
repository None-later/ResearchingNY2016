‘7221. ME AGAIN HOW WE DIED TO MAKE THE
WOPLD $AFE7? FOP DEMOCRACY... ’

M t Your President:

Benezei Quiet, Isolated

by Glenn von Nostitz

He seems so' lonely at times. He cer-
tainly must feel isolated. President
Benezet is not the sort of man who eats
lunch in the student Snack Bar or
makes his appearance at raucous home
basketball games.

He is much too quiet, much too re-
served for that. He would rather meet
with a small committee of fellow adminis-
trators in his plush conference room, or
eat lunch\ with friends at the Hudson
River Club.

His style has been termed “plain” and,
at times, “stiff.” He speaks in the usual
“administrativoese,” the speech pattern
so common to all university officials.

The President does not seem the sort of
man who often raises his voice. On the
contrary, he has a very quiet, perhaps
ineffectual aura about him. Some say he
appears melancholy, but perhaps he is
merely relaxed. That is a good quality for
a man in his position of responsibility to

His public speaking-lit least on an ex-
temporaneous hasis--is usually not
smooth. The delivery lll interspersed with
many “uh‘s” and pauses in mid-sentence,
He appears to be thinking very intently
while he speaks. His voice is friendly and
paternal.

President Benezct has been criticized
for a “lack of dynamism." But it has also
been said that this is really no fault of his
own. He, himself, has mentioned the
many restrictions placed on his freedom
of action by BUNY Central, the Un-
iversity headquarters downtown. They
tell him exactly how much his adminis-
tration can spend, what for, and how.
Perhaps that is what makes him seem so
tried and ineffectual.

Observers say that Benth relies exv
temively on his vice-presidents and assist-
ante. They any he becomes an isolated at
times that nearly all his information
cornea from such aides. True, he rarely
natures onto the podium and even lean

on“; w; mu: m sew ":4

onto the quads. But that isn't really a
valid criticism. Every big administrator

has to rely on assistants.

Nevertheless, the isolation does exist.

"Patrlotlun Is a pernicious,
psychopathic form at Idlocy."
G. 3. Shaw

 

Benczet was heard to remark at a meeting
held about a week before the beginning
of a semester last year: “When do the
students get here?" Apparently, he didn't
know, and had to have someone tell him.

At other times he seems Very well
versed on the latest advances in educat-
ional theory. lie wrote a very progressive
and even "liberal" article recently for the
Chronicle of Higher Education in which
he maintained that students should have a
greater role in what they are taught.

One time Benezet reportedly asked a
student leader what he should do to
become more visible. The student suggests
ed that, for a starter, BeneZet eat lunch
on lndian Quad and meet ll few of the
students there. Benelut thought it was a
good idea.

Yet he has never been seen eating there.

Bent-set seems worried about the prob-
lem of alienation, both on and off
campus One of his chief concerns has
been the gulf between students, faculty,
and administration.

But he has never been quite able to
bridge that gulf. lie seems so helpless in
do anything about it.

The system is too big for him. Priorities
get lost and red tape strangles. There Is a
failure to communicate.

And President Louis Benazat is just one
of the noiseless--well--greased “gears” in
this “university machine," a machine that
has overwhelmed us all, including him. it
continues to run smoothly, processing
thousands of diplomas a yearI but we still
haven't found a person to can cut
through layer on layer of bureaucracy
and really run it.

Sweat 8 Grumble
The Apathy Is Taxing

Today, tomorrow and Thursday, a slender, irregular trickle of student;
will vote in the SA elections. Forty-five people are competing for seats in
the Council, the Senate, and Fresh Class offices. That means at least
forty-five people will vote, and, in comparison to past elections, that will
not be a poor turnout.

The great majority (if SUNYA students not only will not vote, bill also do
not know the diffcrcnct, for cxamplc. hcrwccn the various Lfillil'sll‘ll

The common .lSSulllptiiHl regarding [his disinicrcsl among \Illtlt‘lll\ lll
their own goycrnlilicc. is that such apathy is rcgrcttilblc and ought to hi-

in common with all unquestioned assumptions. [his unc is vcry vague.
And in common with all knccjcrk attitudes, this one is also automatic. liut
why should apathy be changed to anything? All most people want is simple
contentment. Whenever one becomes passionately involved in any piilitlcul
issue, he usually grows agitated and starts to sweat lilltl grumblc. And none

of us like to be around people like that.
Every Tom, Dick 85 Harry

it is not our intention to defend apathy; [llzlf would he a contradiction in
terms. But neither is it our intention to advocate that cvcry Tom, Dick and
Harry blindly, feverishly rush out and vote. Such ll bland and mindless
pronouncement has no more meaning than public scrvicc ads which urgc
apartment house tenants to help prevent forest fires.

We are all going to be dead anyway, and any impassioned political activity
which lacks clearly and consciously dcfincd goals is not only unseemly but
wasteful as well. Rather than dash mildlyult'lllllllllg'llkt“It) vote, just slow
down and think: one of the issues at stake iii [lic upcoming election is who

A Bloody Good Show

To Student Blood Donors:

On behalf of the Albany Area Red
Cross, We would like to express our
sincere thanks to the many students who
donated blood at the Bloodmobile on
Feb. 6. The excellent turnout of donors
produced 289 pints of badly needed
blood, a total which ties the record for
the most blood ever collected at the
midwinter campus Bloodmobile. To those
who patiently stood in slowly moving
lines, We offer our special thanks. Their
willingness to put up with the delays
caused by a large donor turnout made the
work of our staff much easier. And
finally we would. like to thank the more
than 100 people who have already made
appointments to donate blood at the
March 7th Bloodmobile. Their commit-
ment promises to make the next blood
drive as successful as the last one.

We sincerely doubt that the mass
exodus to the exits was caused by a
sudden epidemic of 8:00 classes on
Thursday morning. Beingpossessed of per-
auditory capacities, we failed to hear any
fire signals given in the gym.

Alas, these "loyal" tans seemed to hold
no esteem for the spunk recently ex-
hibited by the Great Danes. They un-
fortunately can accept only victory and
do not appreciate the superior efforts
expended. Those of us who are true fans
remained until the final buzzer, a fitting
tribute to a gutsy team.

Do You Really?

To the editor:

The following petition is circulating in
the downtown dorms, Alden and Water-
bury. lt expresses the sentiments of many
people who have not had a chance to sign
their names. . .

“We . . . as members of the SUNYA
community, demand that the State Uni-
versity of New York at Albany dissolve
its selfvappointed rights to conduct un-
fair investigations and seizures of personal
property, and dictate unfair restrictions
regarding our private lives, without our
consent. This is primarily in reference to
privately owned, UL. approved cooking
utensils and refrigerators which use the
electric current provided by university
housing. We feel that the University and
our elected representatiVes have failed

and erred in their representation of us in
such matters. We demand immediate
abolition of all room searches and sub-
sequent seizures of private” property,
especially for the aforementioned
"illegal" items which can and should be
easily inspected by University officials.

We realize and adhere to the principle
that this would reduce friction between
various levels of the campus community,
and would in no way instigate additional
monetary or temporal expenditures.

We therefore demand an immediate end
to undemocratic, discriminatory and Vain
policies and regulations on this campus."

Andiwe really mean it.

Sincerely,
Anna Marie Myra

Four Years Ago

Four years ago. on January 16th, 1969,
a young university student in Prague set
himself afire in the main square of that
venerable city in the heart of Europe. His
action was a deliberate protest against the
forced occupation of his country by
armies of the Soviet Union and the other
Warsaw Pact llillllHLs Three days later he
died. The occupation forces still remain.
For the people of (‘Aechosloyllkizi the
memory of Jan Pallich still remains. It
would seem filling to note the
significance of his deed at least on its
anniversary, especially since the condition
that prompted it has not changed The
followmg poem about the event needs no
added comment

And here gallop Picasso's hulls

And here march Dali's elephants on
spiders '5 legs

And here rides the knight of La
Mancha.

And here the Karamnzovs carry Hamlet

And here is the core of an atom

And here is ii cosnionaui's base on the
moon.

And here stands a status- WIthoui its
torch

And here runs a lurch Without a statue.

And it's very simple: where the man
ends,

The ﬂame begins.

And then in the silence can be heard the
mumbling

of worms in the ashes. For

In essence billions of people

Are keeping silent.
