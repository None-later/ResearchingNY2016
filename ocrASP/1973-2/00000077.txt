Wrestlers Split;
Vido Wins Twice

by Kenneth Arduino

Rudy Vido remained unbeaten
in dual matches but Larry Mims
and Walt Katz lost as Albany
split a weekend set, walloping
Southhampton 503, then being
beaten by a tough Post team
24-9.

Vido was sensational, pinning

his Southhamptori opponent
with one second left in the first
period. Rudy won by a o-Z
decision against his Post op
poncnt.

Frank Hemian, the surprise of
the second semester. won both
his matches as did Doug Bauer.
Against Southampton, Albany
received many forfeits and was
never pressed.

Brit Post was difficult. Albany
knew it was in trouble when
previously undefeated Wall Kill'l.
was handled with few problems
by the wrestler from Post.
Things got worse when Larry
Ming, also undefeated, was

Swimmers Drowned

The bleak Albany Swimming
season took a turn for the worse
(if that’s possible) last Saturday
during a dual meet with Bridge
water and Fredonia. The two
collegiate swimming powers
came with well stocked teams
and had little mercy on Albany's
beleaguered swimmers. Both
teams defeated Albany rather
soundly, with Bridgewater emer-
ging as the ultimate winner of
the meet.

When a team loses more often
than it wins, it is usually better
for all concerned to look at the
solid performances of individual
athletes. Fortunately that's not a
problem on the Albany Swim
team. One need only look to
Len Van Ryn and Marc Eson to
find stellar performances one

beaten by Post's top wrestler. I
was a tough match but Larry
could not pull out the win.

It was not until late in the
matches that Albany got on the
board. Doug Bauer, Herman and
Vidohelpedalleviate some of the
embarrassment.

This Wednesday the matmen
return home to face the
wrestlers from Marist. it should
be a good warm up for the
SUNY Championships this week-
end. ('ome out and cheer for
your 5-3 grapplers.

can draw solace from. Van Ryn
was even more spectacular than
usual —if that's conceivable. He
took the 200 yard individual
medley and the 500 yard free
style setting a varsity record in
the former. A Van Ryn victory
has come to be as expected as a
cold, dreary winter day in Al-
bany. Marc Eson came through
with another great day, ﬁnishing
second in the 200 yard back-
stroke deapite stiff competition.
The only other good news on a
rather soggy day for State, came
when Jaik Shubert broke his
personal record in the 200 yard
butterﬂy. Jaik had set his pre-
vious best time just one week
befor at Potsdam

I've always been struck by the
iv‘r'nrmruity of the small SUNY

colleges’ athletic domination
over the larger university cen-
ters. Brockport, Fredonia, Cort-
land always seem to be able to
find the financial resources to
ﬁeld a strong swimming or has-
ketball team while the big uni-
versity centers are left wiping
the egg of their faces. In spite of
the growing testimony against
the cliche of the dumb athlete,
Albany’s high academic stan-
m may be creating a drain on
the amount of athletic talent
available to the more academ-
ically competitive university cen-
ter. It is unfortunate but in some
spots Albany may have to sacrif-
ice athletic excellence for acad-
emia. Is it asking too much to
have intelligent, winning ath-
ates?

7 Sieno Tops Danes With Some Rough Grills};~

Nothing original in the heads

Miller in the lockerroom after
the game. The game wasthe
Siena.war and this time, for the
first time in four years, the
Indians toppled State78-75. The
contest was highly emotional
and highly debatable. Siena dev-
astated Albany in the second
half.— built up a 17 point lead—
but, as usual, the Danes staged a

IOSGDDBVQ

magnificent comeback, only to
be frustrated in the end as four
Great Danes fouled out. The
majority of the 6,500 people at
the Washington Avenue Armory
loved it.

It was the largest crowd at the
Armory in ten years. There were
banners, mass cheering, and
plenty of color before the game.
During the game there was just
as much color.There was the

time they stopped the game to
give the ball to Fred Shear, when
he broke the All-Time Siena
scoring record. Shear finished
with 21.’I‘here was Rod Brooks,
who hit for 22 and pulled down
9 rebounds. and Don Rafferty
and 6'10" Eric Stnppenbuck
who hauled down 11 and 9
bounds respectively. For the
Danes, Reggie Smith had 16 and
10 rebounds. Byron Miller
scored 20 and Bob Rossi
bombed in 14. But most impor-
tant, there were some rough
calls.

The tone of the game was set
early — Siemi got ahead and
Albany got in foul trouble. The
opening minutes were a personal
battle between Shear and
Reggie, each hitting B in the first
12 minutes. The difference, as
the Indians edged up by 5, was a
tenacious Sierra defense— man to
man, double teaming of the
wings" keeping the Danes from
penetrating.

In the last six minutes of the
first half, the only Great Dane to
score was Byron. He was good
for a spurt of 8, but couldn‘t
offset thr- entire Siena team.
Albany trailed 3&le at the half.
Although playing good defense,
the Danes were not moving well
at their end of the court. And

pecially Rod Brooks, who hit
three 3 point plays in a row. The
streak, which infuriated Doc
Sauers (he and the other Albany
fans thought one or two of them
might be charging), opened up a
55-41 spread. It got even bigger
'when Brooks hit ajumper at the
11:30 mark to make it 61-44.

Then, just like the Brockport
and U13 games, the Danes went
wild. But this time there were
complications: those rough calls.
While Bob Rossi, Reggie, and
Byron brought the Danes within
8, Troch, Byron, Werner. and
Dave Welchons all got their
fourth personal.

Nonetheless, the comeback
continued. The minority Albany
fans woke up, as the Sierra lead
got cut to 5 with 3:00 left. The
teams exchanged baskets and
then it was bye—bye Byron and
'I‘roeh. Both fouled out in the
space of two seconds— the score
was 7-Iv(i7— there was under two
minutes left— and the Siena
crowd was having a premature
celebration.

Reggie swishcd a jumper, then
combined a steal with a lay up
to rally the Great Danes. After a
Sit-mi free throw made it 75-71,
the roughest call of all finished
the Danes.

Dave Welchons made a stuff,

All things taken into account, it
was a lousy weekend all around,
and mic that will hich to be
tlllll'kly forgotten. After all, you

to Will most of them.

picked up the ball and raced the
length of the court. With 69
seconds left Dave laid it in as he
collided with Stappenback in
mid-air. The basket was disal-
lowed as Welchons was called for
charging, his fifth and final per-
sonal. Even if the play was char-
ging, it was kind of amazing that
the basket was disallowed. 22
seconds later Werner Kolln
fouled out. Brook scored on a
breakaway to wrap it up.

There was a wide range of
opinions on the game. Many felt,
and it is largely true. that Siena
outplayed the Danes and des-
erved the win— i.e. the officia-
ting was fair and didn't make a
difference. Even Doc Sauers
stated, “It's I5 on 5; the players
play the game." Yet valid or not.
no one can deny the importance
of the fouls, especially Wel-
chon’s. As Reggie and Bob Rossi
put it, “the fouls screwed our
momentum.” To complain of
home court officiating is sour
grapes. Likewise to take any-
thing away from the Sicna effort
would also be bush (as bush as
the Siena announcer who contin-
ually and purposely mispm‘
nounccd John Quattrochi's name).
Let it simply be said that in this
reporter‘s eyes, right or wrong,
there were some very rough
calls.
