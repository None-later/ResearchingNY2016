Dorsie W. Willis, who has
carried the burden of a dishonor-
able discharge from the US.
Army for 66 of his 87 years, was
ofﬁcially cleared by the govern-
ment last week.

But despite the broad smile he
showered on friends while
accepting his honorable
discharge papers, the man who
has shined shoes for 59 years
couldn't ,hide his resentment.

“It kept me from getting a
ﬁrst-class job," he said. “They
admit after 66 years that they
made a mistake, but who‘s going
to make up for it?"

Willis was one of 167 black
soldiers dishonorably discharged
after what came to be known as
the “Brownsville Affray" on
Aug. 13, 1906. On that day, 16
to 20 men rode through
Brownsville, Tex.. randomly
shooting into lighted windows

Army Discharges 66 Year Ste

and killing one man. ‘

Townspeople blamed a unit of
black soldiers at Fort Btown,
but a series of military investiga-
tions failed to establish the iden-
tity of any of those involved.

The unit volunteered no infor-
mation on the culprits and all its
members were dishonorably dis-
charged NOVJZS, 1906, for their
“complicity of silence."

Last September, Army Secre-
tary Robert F. Froehlke called
the incident a gross injustice

and changed all the discharges
to honorable.

“They ﬁgured we were all
dead, but I saw it in the paper,"
Willis said. “I told them one of
us wasn’t dead, anyway."

So Froehlke sent two represen-
tatives to the Zion Baptist
Church on Minneapolis‘ near
North Side to right the wrong.
Maj. Gen. DeWitt Smith Jr. of

Wahington, D.C., made the pre-

Willis feels that, at the least.
it's what he deserves.

“None of us said anything
because we had nothing to say,"
he said of the Affray. “it was a
frame-up straight through. They
checked our rifles and they
hadn't been-fired. And we was
infantry. We neVer had any
horses to ride."

Willis, who was born in Missis-
sippi and completed sixth grade
in the Oklahoma Territory, came
to Minneapolis in 1913 to find
work.

For 5‘) years he was a porter
ind slioesliinc man in the North-
western Bank Building Barber

needing a cane to get around, he

finally retired last fall. —

LONDON

The U.S. dollar steadied on Europe's money markets 'I'hursday fo,
the ﬁrst time since it was devalued Monday night, suggesting that the
world monetary crisis of the past two weeks is coming to an end

Bankers and other ﬁnancial sources interviewed here warned that a
number of uncertainties remain which could well ht't‘jt money
markets unsettled for the next few days or even weeks Iiut none
predicted a further crisis selling wave of dollars in the Inlmt'dirite
future such as the one last week which forced Washington to
devalue.

Foreign exchange dealers said there were signs that, money market,
were adjusting to the dollar‘s new exchange rates after the in W

Revision of Board Plan Seen as Probable

by Glenn von Nostitz

The “possibility” of revising
board plans next year is now a
“probability” according to
sources inside the Faculty Slu-
dent Association.

Norbert Zalim, FSA Executive
Director, said earlier this week
that plans are now in the works
to eliminate the customary Suri-
day breakfast, and replace it
with a late morning “brunch”
and a Sunday dinner served at
the usual supper time. The plan
is expected to meet with broad

Despite the relatively small size
of the Alumni Office, it is per-
haps one of the busiest offices
on campus. This is understand-
able when we consider that in
addition to keeping track of the
Alumni and answering their vari-
ous requests for information, the
office also sponsors many pro-
grams and services. These pro—
grams are little known by the
students. This is unfortunate
since technically they cart take
advantage of these programs sim-
ply by joining the Association.

student approval, as attendance
at Sunday breakfast has always
been small.

Zahm cautions that this pro-
gram is still in the “preliminary
stage" and that its implementa-
tion is not yet definite. How-
ever, other sources have indi-
cated that it is probable the
program will become effective
next semester.

There has been some specula-
tion that the new Sunday
arrangement will be coupled
with a board hike next year. It
has been suggested that the Sun-

day plan cotdd conceivably be
used as justiﬁcation for a hike,
since the brunch might cost FSA
more titan the present Sunday
breakfast. Director Zahm would
not commit himself as to
whether there would, in fact, be
a board hike next year, and
Food Service Director Peter
Haley had “nothing to say"
about it.

One other indication that a
hike might be in the offing came
from the financial aids office.
The office in now allowing $700
rather than the usual $650 for

board next year, and financial
aid applications have been
printed and distributed with the
higher ﬁgure. According to
Financial Aids Director Donald
Whitlock, this extra $50 has
been tacked on “just in case"
Food Service should raise meal
contract prices. “We just want to
be covered" says Whitlock.

The aids office must give a
periodic estimation of costs to
the federal government, which
provides most of the aid funds.
The director wants to be sure
that the office does not “fall

short” of the required funds.
Whitlock claims that his office
has not yet received any word
about contract price increases,
however.

Executive Director Zahm says
that FSA is presently “trying to
put the whole package to-
gether." Whether the package
will include a rate hike is still
uncertain, although the meal
plan alterations appear immi-
nent. The FSA Board of Direc-
tors meets next Friday, and any
new proposals should be looked
into afler their.

also purchase a tax card at a
somewhat reduced rate if they
wish to attend University coir-
cerls, plays, etc. Local Alumni
also receive by mail a calendar of
Uiiivcrsitv events.

The Alumni Association also
helps sponsor Homecoming and
Alumni Day. These events give
the Alumni an opportunity or
reunions and to get reacquainled
with the campus. In addition,
llrc Association members hold
branch meetings in their home
conmiunrties from time to time.
These chapter meetings are
usually attended by a repre—
sentative from the camus. who

ties. These chapters sometimes
organize projects of their own to
help the University and students
in their area. The Washington
l).C. chapter recertlly decided to
send air area sludcnl to SUNYA
on a scholarship.

One may wonder how the
Association manages to organize
and supervise these various pro-
grams. The slrricture and leader-
ship of llrc Association is on 11

governed by a fourteen iricriihcr
lloard of Directors. The current

There are another three full-time

including an assistant, Mrs.

The Office also hires four in
