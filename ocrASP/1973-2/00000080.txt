Not too long ago, there was a
movie called “They Shoot

 Marathon Highli’g

won’t be surrounded with the
same kind of desperate tension.
The marathon to be held here
will be sponsored by Henway’s
in honor of its ﬁrst anniversary

hts Hen

Horses, Don't They?” For any-
one who doesn’t remember it, or
may not have seen it, the movie

i x. centered on a dance marathon in
the 1930's in which Jane Fonda
and Michael Sarrazin remained
exhaustineg awake through six
weeks of dancing.

Well, everything supposedly
has a revival sooner or later. The
Dance Marathon is coming back.
And it is coming to SUNYA.
This marathon won’t be like the

and it should be loads of fun for
everyone, both contestants and
spectators.

Henway’s One Year Anniver-
sary Special Dance Marathon
will take place the weekend of
March 2325 and will last for 48
hours - from Friday 8:00 PM. to
Sunday 8:00 pm. Music will be
both live and taped. The prizes
for the winning couples will be
cash, hundreds of dollars worth,
but the amount depends on the
number of couples who enter:
the more people who enter, the

Apparently, even though the alarm did go off in

short circuit or the fact that the alarm may not have

According to Dave Seligman, “The system down

abundance of false alarms may have had something
to do with the short circuiting and jokineg an-

The involved procedure which dormitory and
security officials must follow for reporting fires
could have accounted for the alleged delay. Alv

Residents of Oneida arid ol ()rrorirlaga's first floor
were allowed to return to their rooms at five a.m,.
frilly two hours after the tlirce o'clock alarm.
Several. even then did not go back to bed, but
rather preferred to cal and Icriiiniscc over their first

make up for the loss, but neither one knew of any

where there was much more smoke.

Smoke damage occurred in the lobby of Cooper Hall. Other
damage included the bursting of a water'pipe.

The furniture which caught on fire was being stored in the tunnel
temporarily, according to John Bucklioff, Director of the Physical
Plant, pending a “scratch and dent sale" to be held soon by the
Housing Office to the public. Scratch and dent furniture is university
furniture which can no longer be used because of the damage dorie
to it due to wear and tear. According to Brickhoff, the presence of
the frirniture in the tunnel did create a fire hazard. As SUNYA does
not have any warehouses. however. the scrvrcc tunnels are alien used
for storage, but only if necessary.

Associate Director of Resrdences Garry l’ctre did not believe that
the furniture created a hazardous situation. It did not present arty
more of a hazardous sitriation than anything else would. for
instance, the furniture in a dorm room. according to I’etrc. What's
more. the service tunnels have been used for storage ever since the
university was built, and the fire inspectors who come through
regularly have never recommended that the practice he stopped.

Tire cause of the fire. which started among some pieces of
upholstered furniture. is unknown. According to Petrc, it did not
sccm as if the fire started by spontaneous combustion. However, it
could not be determined whether or not anyone had been in the
scrvrce tunnel. or how anyoire might have gotten in there. I’etrc
stated. “(.‘halk it up to accident.“
