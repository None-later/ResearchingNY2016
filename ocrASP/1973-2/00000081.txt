WASHINGTON, DC. (CPS)
—— Late in January President
Richard Nixonl. told a nation-
wide radio audience that “(’I’he)
search for waste has led us into
every nook and cranny of the
bureaucracy."

He defended his 1974 budget
cits in that address by claiming
that he had merely pruned out
some “old programs that out-’
lived their time, or that have
failed."

Critics feel the tool used to
"trim" the budget was a
sharply-honed axe that, in the
words of one columnist. is
“pointed right at the heart of
the Democratic party and its
program." Actual budget cuts
amount to some $12.3 billion of
which $10 billion is carved from
the program aimed at the poor
and underprivileged.

According to the budget, out-
lays for the ﬁscal year starting
July of 1973 will total $268.7
billion, roughly $20 billion over
last. The largest proportionate
increase in spending was in the
direct cash grants to college stu-
dents in the form of government
scholarships. The defense
budget, although up several
billion dollars,. dipped below 30
percent of the total budget for
the ﬁrst time in 20 years. Little
hope was given for reductionsin
defense spending based on the
termination of overt U.S. partici-
pation in the Vietnam war.

Where then did the econo-
mizing take place?

Ehrlichman replied 'that the
President was not asking for
higher taxes on the affluent,
because the overall tax burden in
the country was already so high
as to threaten economic incen-
tives in the private sector.

This prompted one observer to
quip that the Nixon budget was
based on the “Inverse Robin
Hood theory of economic
development." or "take from
the poor and give to the rich."

Bodyguard for Nixon

by Frank Connier
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON AP — The Secret Service. by some accounts, is
having trouble replacing President Nixon‘s chief bodyguard. who was
ousted last week. A spokesman denied the report.

Sources within the elite plainclothes police force said Wednesday
there is a scarcity of willing candidates for the job. Public
information officer John Warner said: “We're not having any
difﬁculty at all; a replacement will be announced in the near
future.“

The dissenting sources said at least four senior agents have rejected
the assignment because of unhappiness over circumstances involved
in the Feb. 9 transfer of Robert H. Taylor, ii former special agent in
charge of the White House detail. Taylor, 46, was transferred to
what most of his colleagues regard as a lesser position.

Asked if the top agents had balked at assuming primary responsi-
bility for presidential protection, Warner said “that is totally
unfounded."

Richard E. Kciser, 38, holds the post on an acting basis.

Ronaldl L. Ziegler, White House press secretary, Tuesday specifically
denied published reports that Taylor was transferred because of
disagreements on security matters with H. R. Handeman, Nixon's
closest personal aide. Ziegler said he felt the two men “got along

Aid For Vietnam

by Jim Adams
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON AP * 'I‘He White House reportedly is consulting
leaders of Congress to determine how strongly postwar financial aid
for North Vietnam is opposed on Capitol Hill.

A Republican leadership source disclosed the consult Lions
Wednesday as the White Housc and Hanoi announced a joint
economic commission to consider US. reconstruction aid for the
North.

Congress has made clear it is in no mood to consider aid for llanoi
now. But the source indicatcd the White House is trying to find out
what congressmen would consider approving after peacil is estab-
lishctl and all Amcrican POWs are rcturm‘d, and the missing are
accounted for.

Rep. l‘l.lt. Gross, R-lowa, said the commission is “the conduit for
the handout" and added, “I'm opposed to paying lhcm anything."

Chairman (ii-urge H. Mahon, D"'TI‘X., of the House Appropria-
tions Committee, which would hich to approve assrstancc money,
says Congress would not approve ll now Iiul he would not speculate
on what might happen later.

“'l‘liis isa very bitlcr and disturbing llnng for the Ami-ricnn people,
Mahon said. “I think cvuryunc Will Wilnl lo lrcad very cautiously in
lIIlh ill't‘il and l ccrlainly will."

Son. ('hzirlos E. I’i‘rcy, R-lll., has said also he does not believe
Congress would approvc aid for Hanoi unless it is contrihulctl jointly
by US, allies.

Secretary of State William I’. Rogers told the House Foreign
Affairs Committee last week that is what the Nixon administration is
trying lo work out.

’WILOOM  MII’ MANY'OF YOUR VI! ...'

by Dolores Barclay
Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK AP — Myles J.
Ambrose. special consultant to
President Nixon for drug abuse
law enforcement, said on
Thursday that Nixon soon will
propose legislation to Congress
calling mandatory minimum
sentencing in narcotics cases.

Ambrose, a special assistant
attorney general and former US.
commissioner of customs, made
the announcement before a
hearing by the state legisla-
ture‘s Joint Codes Committc on

Gov. Nelson A. Rockefellcr‘s
\I'

proposed drug program.
Ambrose said the President
will propose such legislation
within the next few weeks. and
that suggcgtcd minimum hcn-
lcnccs “will be substantial,"
adding:

Illldiidutory

, x\ \

“They will treat all offenders
equally. They will reduce plea
bargaining processes. They. will
provide for speedy trials, in con-
junction with stiffer bail require-
ments for those arrested for traf-
ficking in heroin and cocaine."

Concerning details of the Presi-
dent’s proposed legislation,
Ambrose said that as a federal
official it would be “inapprop-
riate and possibly presump—
tuous" for him to discuss them.

But Ambrose did not comment
on the disparity in the judicial
s ‘nlencing of convicted nar-
cotics offenders and plea bar
gaining.

“Judicial sentencing patterns
do not reﬂect any attempt lo
achich any special national,
social or policy objectives. 'l'hcy
frequently rcflccl the views.
prejudices and idiosyncrasies of

    

the individual sentencing judge,"
he said.

Ambrose said plea bargaining
had been over-used, even though
it had a place “in certain circum-
stances.” He did not elaborate.

Questioned by State Sen.
Abraham Bernstein, D-Bronx,
concerning mitigating circim-
stances in a defendant's life
affecting sentencing, Ambrose
said such circimstances should
not be taken into account.

“People who sell heroin.
regardless of how they come
about having it, are murderers
on the installment plan and we
have to stop them." he said.

Ambrose also said youthful
narcotic violators would have to
be jailed if they were convicted
of selling heroin, but he did not
specifically say whether a
mandatory sentence should be
applied.
