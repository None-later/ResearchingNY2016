Legal action hm been initiated
against the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) in the latest
attempt to stop consumer use of
the controversial FDbC Red
Dye No. 2.

The widely used food coloring
is found in foods, drugs, and
cosmetics. Alone or blended
with other dys, it colors ice
cream, hot dogs, processed
cheese, luncheon meats, dry
cereals, pickles, cmned fruits.
pet foods, salad draainp, jellis
and jams, candies, gelatins, non-
cola soft drinks. lipstick, as well
as many other items.

On January 24, the Health
was "vroup petitioned the

to prohibit continued cer-
tiﬁcation of the dye, contending
that it lacks requisite legal status
for certification, and that there
is substantial evidence of its
toxicity at very low levels.

The waxingth organiza
tion has been engaged since No—
vember, 1971, in stirring public
interest to eliminate the dye
from the consumer market.

The ﬁrst indication of the
dye’s potential danger was a

report of two studies conducted
in Russia in 1970, where labora~
tory animals fed low levds of
Red 2 experienced fetal deaths.

The FDA began a series of
tests in 1971 to determine possi-
ble hazards of the dye. Pregnant
rats ingesting various amounts of
Red 2 in distilled water were
found to have a higher incidence
of fetal deaths than identical rats
not fed Red 0 This method of
administering the dye is known
as gavage.

The FDA concedes that about
50 percent of Red 2 is consumed
in beverages. especially carbon-
ated soda pop and soft drinks
made from pro-mixed powders.
Consumption of these beverages
often approximates the gavage
type dosing described in the
above experiment.

A5 a result of the tests, a
committee of FDA experts in
toxicology, genetics, and repro
ductive physiology recommen-
ded:

“It would be prudent to limit
FD&C Red No. 2 only to indi-
rect or incidental applications
involving food; that is, limit use
of the color to such applications
as food packaging where migra-
tion to food is nil, color marking
of animal food additives, and to
external uses in drugs and cos-
metics.”

The FDA scientist: also recom-
mended that daily intake of Red
2 be limited to nomei than
.075 milligram per kilogram of
body weidit, which is too low a
dosage to permit effective color-
ing. (A single can of cherry soda
can contain 3 much as 62 milliv
grams of Red 2.)

The National Academy of Sci-
ences (NAS) was asked by the
FDA in December 1971 to re-
commend : course of action.

Tests were conducted by labor-
atories, under the auspices of an
inter-industry committee repre-
senting the Grocery Manufactu-
rers Association, the Pharma-
ceutical Manufacturers Associa-
tion, the Certiﬁed Colors Indus-
try Corporation and the Cos-
metic Toiletries and Fragrance
Association. These tests reported
that in pregnant mammals ad-
ministered Red 2 in dosages of
27, 90, 300, or 1000 mg/ltg of
body weight, there were no ap
parent birth defects or effects of
the dye on fetal survival.

However. among rats and mice,
the incidence of fetal deaths was
consistently higher for Red 2
than for the controls, ranging
from three to nine percent for
the dosed groups as compared to
only one percent for the con-
trols.

"While the laboratory may not
have considered the difference
statistically signi ficant or worthy
of mention," says Consumer Re-
ports, “Consumer's Union medi-
cal consultants are reluctant to
dismiss it so casually."

Consumer Reports is published
by Consumers Union. a non-
profit organization dedicated to
providing the public with infor-
mation on consumer goods and
services.

Another study of albino rats
revealed that gavage feeding has
a great impact on fetal mor
tality. The point of the expenv
ment was to demonstrate that
there shouldn’t be great concern
over ingesting Red 2 in solid
food.

However. more than half of
Red 2 intake comes from
colored beverages, colored drugs,
and colored vitamins, which can
be taken With water,

After evaluating the industry
studies, the Committee on Food
Protection of the NAS main-
tained that they “failed to con‘
firm" the Russian and FDA

findings that Red 2 causes fetal
deaths in certain animals.

The committee concluded in
June 1972 that the animal data
did not indicate :i health hazard
for humans.

The FDA then proposed to set
a L5 mg/kg body weight toler-
ance for Red 2, which is 20
times the maximum level origi-
nally recommended by the FDA
scientists.

The proposal was never
enacted.

In November 1972, further
Russian studies revealed that
female animals fed Red 2 at
doses of LS mgi'kg body weight
experiencrd inhibition of the
estrual cycle and atrophy of the
ovaries, Pregnant animals ex-
perienced impaired lactation,
and 300 percent as many fetal
deaths as the controls. One out
of seven animals born alive died
during the first month, and
those that survived did not grow
as well.

The studies found that male
animals fed Red 2 had a de-
creased length of sperm life, a
decreased movement of sperm,
and a reduced reSIstance of
sperm

The Health Research Group
claims that the results of the
studies undertaken by the indus-
tries were invalid. "The tests
were arranged so that it all came
out right." said Dr. Sydney
Wolfe. “The dye is extremely
toxic in small amounts."

Both the Health Research
Group and Curisumi'r Itt'purlx
recommend that Red 40. u ni-
ccntly developed food coloring
approved for its safety in April,
1971, be substituted for lied “.2.

Red 2," says Dr. Wolfe, “and it
isn't as deceptive." RE.

Dr. Wolfe goes further, recom-
mending that the public should
not be overly concerned With
the cold‘healthYLeir food, and
instead eat a “health and essen-
tial diet."

The Health Research Group’s
petition, which is the first of its
kind regarding Red 2 to be
presented to the FDA, also
maintains that FDA certification
of the dye is illegal. “C1

According to the petition,
“Certification is basically an
FDA service to industry to
assure it that artificially colored
products will have a uniform
color. Certification is a judgment
merely on trueness of color, not
on safety. Under thelaw, a certi—
fication should occur only after
the FDA has adjudged a dye safe
or given it a provisional listing."

Red 2 had been given ii provr
sional listing as a previously
marked dye in 1960. 'Ihensung
expired December 31, 1971. Al-
though the FDA has proposed
safety tolerance levels for the
dye in July 1972, these tole~
rances were never enacted, Since
January 1972, the FD&C Red
No. 2 has had no provisional
listing, and no safety approval.

As rr-quired by 21 U,S.C. 376,
“ProVIsionul Listings of Com-
mercuilly Established Colors,"
(1(2) (A) and 21 U.S.C. 376 (d),
the FDA must act within 90
days after filing of the petition.

Since June 1972, the FDA has
Cl‘rllflt‘d river 270,000 pounds of
