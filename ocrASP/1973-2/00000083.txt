imerits, has a couple of unusual jazz
albtims 0111. Paul Mom's Inside
II (KE Jlti00)is pecttliar ‘more
in terms of form thair in con‘
tent. The idea is to have Mom‘s
flute featured amidst the sounds
of nature. The result is some
nice mood music. with the natu-
ral beauty of the [lure captured
well. but very little happens
musically.

In Weather Report‘s second
album on Columbia called [Sing
The [Jody lz'lr’clric (KC 3] 352).
there exists ample proof that ilris
very “electric” group is not just
an invention of engineers and
studio geniuses.lri facl.on side
one. where the strrdio is avail-
able, there is far too much atten-
tion given to tricks. and far little
to the musicians Orr side two.
which is taken from a live con-
cert in Japan, the true strength
of the group becomes obvious.

The co-lcaders. reed man Wayne
Shorter, and Joe Zawintil, who
plays various keyboards. show
that they are capable of playing
both inside and otttsidc convert-
tional rules while avoiding chaos
and producing sortie very dynaA
mic music. It is a musical conver-
sation that is unrestrained. yet
decipherahle. One will cut in on
the other. they will react sortie-
timcs sharply. at other timcs
gently. until one of them will
once again be soloing freely. it
reminds one of tacks spinning on
a table, hitting each other arid
skipping apart. What is more
important. is that thc tccling
that these musicians have for
each other, and the strong stip-
port of bassist Miroslav Vittioiis
and drummer Litc (iravatt arc
the source of sortie greatly lll-
spircd solo activrty. This album
must be rated as half great. half
fair.

beauty. The combination of Earl
on soprano, and Carl on alto,is
lso noticeably different in
sound. The concentration seems
to be more on mood than on
melodic development, and the
mood is pleasant and euphoric,

Young View of Washington

The Death of the OED

WASHINGTON-Even as the
body of Lyndon Baines Johnson
lay in state in the Austin, Texas
library which bears his name, his
successor in the White House.
made clear his intentions to
abolish the Office of Economic
Opportunity, the war room of
Mr. Johnson‘s battle against
poverty,

It was ironic that the new; of
OEO‘s demise should come rrt
the time of Lyndon Johnson’s
death, but the news itself was no
surprise. The organization's life
has been as stormy as was the
Johnson Presidency.

Head Start was perhaps OEO's
best known creation. A program
to aid underprivileged pru-
schoolers, it was the mainstay
which assured the agency's con-
tinued funding by Congress in
the midst of failures on other
more turbulent fronts, failures
like the Job Corps, which
created expections both in Con-
gress and among its participants
which the program‘s adminis-
trators knew it could not fulfill.

Therein lies the real cause of

0130‘s failure and the failure of
the “war on poverty" itsr-lf‘
expectations were created
among the poor and within the
American public as a whole,
which the government had no
intentions of fulfilling, indeed,
which it knew would be imv
possible to meet.

The existing programs adminis-
tered by CEO will be divided
among various federal agencies.
the bulk of them going to the
Department of Health. l‘Irllr
cation and Welfare. Predictably,
the organization‘s controversial
legal si-rviccs program is not,
among thust' [)l't)]l(ll~i(‘(l to llt‘

Paul Harvey News

transferred, and presumably the
President will again push for the
creation of a separate legal ser-
vices corporation, more directly
under his control.

R. Sargent Shriver, the Demo-
cratic candidate for Vice Presi-
dent in 1972, is OEO’s best
known former director. Known
on Capitol Hill as a “super—
salesmun," Shriver was able to
wrangle funds for the agency's
programs but. failed to deliver
the results he so eloquently
promised.

He is likely to join the large
group which will no doubt
oppose- lhe dismantling of CEO
when Congress considers the
President's fiscal year lEl7Il-7‘l
budget proposal, scheduled to be
presented this week. The Admin-
istration exudes confidence that
the President‘s proposal will
carry in Congress: We don't in-
ttrnd to do away with 0E0
programs, they say, merely
transfer them to the appropriate
agencies for administration.

What they fail to add is that
hidden away in the cavernous
bownls of NEW, programs which
now operate under the flag of
the Executive Office of the Pfttn'
idcnt will have little muscle of
their own to use in fighting for
survival at the departmental
money trough. 'l‘hus, good pro-
grams in time will stand a lwttr-r‘
than-fair chance of ports-hing
along wrtli the bad.

'l‘hrirc's ti word for it It's.
called backlash. It's what hair

tr'ntly exceed, and by astonish
iirg margins, that which is do

‘l'he Homosex Manual-Part I

This will probably be the first
part of a series of articles dealing
with sex and love, how and why,
They will not be exhaustive writ-
ings but excerpts from a for-th-
coming book “The Homosex
Manual”. I feel the Gay Libera-
tion movement has dealt fully
with all the other aspects of gay
life, but tenth'to be shy when it
comes time to talk about nuts
and bolts.

Anywuy getting back to sex
and love. 1'” start off by saying
that in no way am lam expert
on gay sex or gay love; l speak
solely form personal experience;
rather extensive experience l
might add. So if I should say
something that you disagree with
feel free to write me and say so.
Secondly anyone who says gay
sex and love is the some as
straight sex anti lovr- is full of
shit. There are some similarities
but mostly differences. One ma-
jor difference is timing, which is
our topic for today.

Point l- Most straights come to

grips with their sexuality before
gays do. Which is logical since
society encourages straights to

indulge in Wanton sex around

the age of 15 or so. Parents
don't get. upset if a straight boy
announces he has lost his virgin-
ity at the age of 17. They'll
probably be relieved if it hap-
pens when he's 19, and damn
near applaud if he finally gets
some by 21. Regardless of social
standing or family income, get-
ting some pussyiis a sign of
manhood and maturity, and the
sooner one becomes a man and
matures, the better. My father
was so openminded that he was
willing to take me to a house of
prostitution when l was 16.
(Fortunately Mom said no, and
my virginity was left intact.)
Point 2- Sex in America is
competitive; plain and simple.
What else would you expect in a
capitalist state? However since it
would be grossly unfair to make
someone compete without prior
warm-up, a man is excused from

using a little mathematics, Wl'

childhood dreams. Not so for
gays, who, due to increased mat-
urity at time of threshold, pain-
fully recall what rotten sex part-
ners they were at 19. (Take it
from someone who has had
them young. They‘re lollsyl)

Where does this leaVe us‘.’ What
does it all mean? Simple. Lead-
ers and spokesmen in the gay
movement must realize that the
newer members of our forces are
suffering and undergoing a pain-
fully traumatic period in their
lifes. Most important they will
not be as psychologically fit to
partake in the struggle ahead as
older members. Now l know
what some of you are thinking;
gay sex shouldn't be, and isn't.
as competitch as straight sex.
Well l say yes, and no. Gays are
not that concerned with how
many men a particular guy has
hurl, but they are more concern-
ed with how good a person is in
bed. There's nothing wrong with
this; our lives are naturally more
sexual than straights because we
are more honest about it. WP
haw- trnditionally always enjoy-
ml the finer things in life, and
one of them is good sex, with
a lot of swmit.

As for you clost-tcases, and
newly reborns, what does this
ml an to you‘.’ It means that you
fears are real. and you have a
right to ht» shy. But the faUIt is
not yours. It nit-ans that I'm
going to do something I wish
someone had (lone when l was a
freshman. and jllSl coming out;
namr-ly talk about the more t-m-

Point 1 You're probably right if

H‘llt‘l’d gays irVoirl you for two
main reasons, First, you're basic-
