In the last issue of the ASP this
column gave only brief mention
to the Advertising Department.
Several members of the Ad de-
partment felt that they were
being ignored, deliberately.
Nothing could be farther from
the truth. let it be said that the
Advertising department is by far
the largest single source of grief
on the entire paper.

Last March, for example, was a
particularly slow period, news
wise. The front page story was
something about the increase in
the amount of algae in the came
pus pond; and the effect it may
have on 1986 enrollment. The
centerfold was to be an en»
quiring photographer asking
thirty students from the third
floor of the Campus Center what
they thought of the fact that
Spring was only two weeks
away. It was a typical twelve
page paper . . .One news story, a
picture back page, and some
letters that the Editor solicited.

The Ad manager at the time
was not satisfied with what he
called a “puny” twelve-page
paper. He went out that evening
and rounded up ten pages worth
of ads (half‘full pages, to allow
more copy and tech work, of
course). The tech stuff dele-
gation (the tech editors and the
two biggest tech workers we

“Ask the ASP”

Dear Ask ffll' Asp,

1 had u very wonderful and
serious relationship with my (ox)
boyfriend for about a year. Al-
though we had little arguments
hero and there during the your
that we went together, we were
very close. Last work, be called
me up and told me everything
was ovor. Of course I was vt-ry
upset but the thing which madl-
me feel better was the hope that
we would remain friends. [still
expect him to call me evory day.
just like before, but he hasn't
called me yet. l’m very deprive;-
ed about the whole thing und 1
just don‘t know what to do to
get myself out of this depress-
ion.

Dr'ar W. A ,

When a serious relationship
such as you had breaks up, it is
nach to expect things to goon
“just like lllfftit‘t' " You scam to
feel that llt‘ too hilll wool: to be
friends. He may have lllllllll'll
thb‘ in your last conversation to
either prevent hurting you so
much, or In Mlllllll‘ his own
conscience in any case, they
seem to ani- llt‘l‘ll empty words
on his part since he hasn't gotten
in touch with you sun-r- you
broke up. With this in inniri, lin-
bcsl. thing for you to do now in
to accept the fact [but the ruin
tionahip is over.

Now: Letters to “Ask the ASP”
can be sent to CC 326.

Hour Ask the Asp,

Is a guy enlitlcd to his room at
least our night of the weekend?
Here's the situation. My room-
matc's girlfriend is always stay-
ing over both Friday and Satur-
day nights, and if l'ni lucky I get
a place to sleep iii someone vlsc's
room or :i mattress in our suiti-
room l'ni gelling really tired of
pulling out (no pun intended)
Our main problem is

for him
that the girl is in a
(woman) room, and cannot l(ll.'l(

male and his girlfriend place
much importance on llll‘ll‘ sexual
relationship, but I lhink my fvcl

many, many students on this
cumpUs, in all cases, one basic
principle holds true. Your roomr
male and yourself both have the
right of privacy, yet you each
have a responsibility towards
each other as well. You cannot
expect your roommate to givv
up his sexual life completely; yet
at the same lime he cannot
expect you to give up your bed
two nights of the week, (-5-
pccially when you have nowhere
clsr- to sleep. This is where com
promisi- comes in.

Discuss the problem sensibly
with your roommate, muking
hini aware of your point of view,
and see if you can come to some
sort of compromise which is
agreeable to both of you. Per-
haps he’ll try to find somewhere
else for you to sleep. Or maybe
ln-‘il reduce his activities to one
night it week. But. 1 certainly
think some sort of compromise
is called for, because you are
definitely getting the bad anI of

had) went to see the Ad Mana-
ger. We asked him why he had to
make the-paper so big. We had
told him that bail was refused
for the “Tech Ten" and half of'
the rest were still missing. We
had asked him, therefore, to
take pity on us; he didn’t have
to stay and do tech work until
5:30 a.m.

His answer was cold and brief.
l‘l have to add pages. That's
why they call me the Ad mana-
ger!“ he said, and waved us out
of his specious ofﬁce.

’I‘liet Advertising manager is no
longer with us. The bank was
ﬁnally able to gel. funds to clear
his check, and he bought his
own university. (Just for spite,
for the next three months, he
placed twelve half page Ads per
issue).

The current Ad manager de~
fines Advertising as the act of
being adverse. One of our more
recent papers had very few ad-
vertisements. It was due to the
post»Christmas slump. She
claimed that she had to do some-
thing for Ad stuff morale, and to
keep the Ad production people
off the streets (at. least when she
was on them, she was heard to
mutter). She disappeared for
several hours. Actually she was
in the back of one of the file
cabinets, looking for more Pub-
lic Service Ads and old accounts.
(Re'clect Senator Keating, the
Rice Paddy, Lucky Strike
greens, and Lunch at the Pat-
rnon Room on one page!) She
found enough ads to fill a
twenty page paper. At that mcr
ment someone walked in with a
letter to the Editorabout AMlA
coverage in the Capitol News-
papers. The Ad muniiger (af-
fectionately called “theox”)
jumped up and down and tin'
nounccd that the paper would
lie twenty-four pages long.

ew/ leisure/ pre view
inﬁldﬂhLASE '
[K it Advertises to Pay

Several editors complained.
They said that they didn't have
the copy to fill such a paper. She
wouldn’t budge.

When the layouts for the ads
were distributed to the editors,
there was general confusion
(back from the front?). The
front page had three ads, and
were placed in such a way that.
the ASP/TUESDAY had to go
along the side of the page, and
the main headline would have to
start on the bottom and be
continued on page three. Page
two was even worse. The text
was to run down the first col-
umn for the first inch and a half,
and then would split up into two
columns of eight millimeters
each. The text would make a left
turn at the middle of the page
and finish on half of the last
column.

These problems were in turn
straightened out. The Ad mana-
ger did not realize that stories
should have a readable layout.
Her reasoning was that the ad
vertisers PAY for what they get,
and the Ad people never get
their names on the page. On the
other hand, the literary people
(news, arts. sports, editorial
page, etc.) get to sign their work,
and don’t even pay! In fact, she
said, voice rising, the editors
GET PAID! I explained to her
maid that there is a difference;
that this is a newspaper, and as it
free press . . . “That's the point!
a FREE press! Is that fair?" She
ﬁnally agreed that the news is
important, and said she would
not put any more ads on page
one.

There is not much we can do
when the ad department decides
to turn a few screws. “Who pays
for this paper, anyway?" is a
familiar cry. This gives us an
opportunity for revenge. We can
go to the masthead and double
the sum of "funded by Student
'l'ax "
