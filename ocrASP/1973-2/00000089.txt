. Danes, Lose Again .on

by B'rucq Maggin

The season ended Wednesday
night for the Albany State Basi-
ketball team. It was just the final
blow to a season that was sup-
posed to be but wasn‘t, as the
Danes lost to Plattsburgh State,
thus eliminating any chances for
a playoff bid.

This was the year that the
Danes were going to make it.
Two years ago the Albany State
basketball team was overlooked
in favor of Hartwick for a NCAA
tourney bid. Last year it
happened again. Just when it
looked like Albany was on their
way to the playoffs. the SUNY
conference found a trivial rule,
eliminating the Danes' chancesl'
for post-season play.

But this year it, was going robe
different. Four of the Dane
starters were back. Doc Sauers
and the team seemed assured of
at least an zit-large bid and had a
good shot at the SUNYAC
crown. This, however, was not
to be the year. it wasn't the
NCAA selection committee‘s

fault, nor was it the fault of the
SUNY conference. It was the
Danes own failure of not playing
good consistent ball throughout
the season. Blame it on the refs
or blame it on the fact that some
of the teams Albany lost to
played over their heads, but it
still was the failure of the Danes
toplay good, tough basketball as
a cohesive unit on the road.

Now we don’t have to play
anymore guessing games as to
how Albany could make it to
the playoffs or SUNYAC COMOH'
tion. It just doesn't matter what
the other teams do if Albany
can't win.

The big problem at the univer-
sity is that we expected too
much from the basketball team.
The school newpaper and radio
station overated the team and
the Danes themselves played
above their heads in a couple of
key home contests, creating
much excitement. Everyone rev
fused to admit to the simple fact
that the Danes just aren't that
good. They‘re just an average
hall club with a great coach.

The Plattaburgh game was like
many other Dane road perfor-
mances. The team came out and
stunk up the court in the early
going falling progressively be-
hind. Plattsburgh ran off 12
straight points before the Danes
were able to get on the board
and the score got worse. Rossi
finally put Albany back into the
game as he started popping from
all over. The Dane defense didn't
arrive till ten minutes into the
contest. Pluttsburgh was allowed
many easy shots and uncon-
tested layups. Albany was lucky
to be in the game at half time, as
they were only down by ten
points.

The second half wasn't too
much better than the first but
Albany started playing some bet-
ter ball. Albany still could not
close the gap with Plattsburgh's
lead fluctating between ten and
fifteen points. Finally the Danes
awoke and started narrowing the
score, helped by some Platts-
burgh turnovers. Byron Millers's
basket with less than two and a
half minutes brought the Danes

Sixth Win. The Albany State
Wrestling team did something
they Were unable to do all last
year - win six matches. It was an
easy win, as a crowd of about a
hundred saw the Danes destroy
Maris! 46-3 Wednesday night.

Leading the Danes were 167
pounder Doug Bauer and heavy-
weight Rudy Vido. Bauer had
the quth'Sl pin of [he year. 52

The pin followr-d a takc down
after only ll SL‘CUlKlS.

Maris! came with only si‘vcn
wrestlers and were forced to

take three forfeits. To recover
they announced one lineup
which would have given Moody,
Grossman and Horn of Albany 21
forfeit. Instead they switched,
giving Walt Katz and Larry
Mims, along with Grossman, the
forfeits.

This forced Moody to wrestle
without warm up and both he
and Horn without mental prep-
aration. ll had no effect on
Moody who gained a superior
decision of 18-0. Ilorn was
beaten 7-L'i.

won 4~3.

Herman was even more drama-
tic as the match was tied in the
last period. With 15 seconds left
Herman picked up his man and
slammed him to the mat. He
then let him escape and held on
to ii one point Victory.

Albany's other winner was cap-
tain Jeff Albrecht. Albrecht was
all ovor his man, leading 10-0
when he pinned him down early
in the third period.

SUNYA Women 37-24. Foul
trouble in the fourth quarter was
responsible for the third loss of
this season. The Albany women
were 3 points down after making
up a twelve point deficit. Dut-
chess had trouble with our
player-tosplaycr defense. Unfor-
tunately, co-captains DeLucco
and Simon fouled out midway
through the final period and
McCormick, with Al personals,
was forced to play cautiously
Lack of depth and cxperiencr-
was a factor for the rest of the
contest.

by Nathan Salon!

Well Kuhn and his cronies are
at it again this spring. Led by the
likes of Joan Payson and Joe
Brown, they apparently intend
to sacrifice another baseball sea-
son to the almighty dollar.

It is really a shame that the so
called “Hot Stove League” has
degenerated into the “Hot Strike
League,” and it is the owner's
fault. At this time of year, as
news of contract signings come
in, the interest of the fans
should be warming up after a
long, cold winter to the team of
his choice. Instead, thanks to the
owners, the fan must bicker over
who is right --- the owners or the
players --- instead of the obvious
superiority of the Yankees over
the Mats.

No sooner does the American
Leauge take the first major step
forward in 71 years, than the
combined owners decide to
throw baseball back to the days
of John McGraw and Cy Young.
The situation is simple: there
will be no spring training until
the owners have ii just and hon-
orable settlement (and we know
how long that took in Vietnam).
Collectively they prefer to be
known as men of economy men
of intelligence and men of hon»
esly. I call them shylocks, jack-
asses, and liars.

To be fair, let us examine the
issues from the owners' point of
view. The owners are the ones
who “run the show." What’s
good for the owners is good for

Thoughts on the Baseball Strike

basele - just ask them!!! In
this day and age, aman like Phil
Wrigley cannot be expected to
run the Chicago Cuba at a slight
loss. Just because Mr. Wrigley
has seyeral other profit making
businesses and probably writes
the Cubs off as a tax loss, is no
reason for Wrigley to provide the
public with a popular form of
entertainment. Doesn’t your
heart just pump peanut butter
for poor Phil, a multi-
Amillionaire.

How about men like Atlanta's
ex-General Manager Paul
Richards, who, if I remember
correctly, proposed the use of
minor league players if the major
leaguers went on strike.
Wouldn't you rather see a Joe
Schmoe from the I’awtuckcl
Putrids playing first base instead
of Henry Aaron. Perhaps men
like these would come up with
even more l)l‘llllilnl suggestions if
they drew Wllill the best AAA

person buys a scorecard, add on

fan is usually good for at least a

' 1.», (among

frank and a soda, add on another
$1,875,000. This makes the
total value of our deal
$4,610,000, without even con-
sidering souvenirs, all ticket
prices, local radio and LV. con-
tracts, and their share of the
NBC contract. Renting out of
Shea Stadium is quite inex-
pensiVe for the Meta, as is the
rent of most stadiums, and of
course they generally get a tax
cut.

What do the owners want?
They want the reserve clause to
remain in effect, thus binding a
player to his team, like it or not.
In baseball, you cannot play out
Your option, because it means
unemployment. They want
lower costs and restraint on so]:
iirics, one of their few reasonable
demands. They also want to
retain their God-like power, al-
though they expect the players
to accept them as benevolent
fathers instead of slaveowners.
They would prefer to giVe the
players ii right which most union
employees have -- the right to
binding arbitration of contracts.

Of course the owners are
willing to compromise. They
have llﬂl‘til‘d to their own pro-
posals to put the reserve clause
untlcr investigation, and to coli-
tinuo llii- pension fund as it was
outlined last year.

Then, last week, a major break-
through -- the owners offered a
binding arbitration clause to the
players. Obviously the players
were getting what they wanted,
so they would agree to this

r” rim. V.

reasonable arrangement, then
the strike was as good as over.
Fortunately for the players,
Marvin Miller, their lawyer,
happened to notice a few things
- like the fact that a contract
could not be arbitratod for a
second straight year. Oh, by the
way, the players would have to
give up their right to a maximum
salary cut of 20%. Of course the
owners, who were honest
enough not to bother men-
tioning these loopholes would
not take advantage of them. To
have the player win in arbi-
tration, and then take it out on
him by a 50% salary cut in the
next season would be morally
wrong — but shrewd business --
and the owners need money!!!”
I believe that it is about time
that the owners opened their
blind eyes to the fact that what
is good for the players is also
good for baseball. They have
trouble accepting men like Cleon
Jones as their intellectual equals.
They do not seem to realiZe that
$10 per day meal money is not
enough to feed Tom Seaver, let
alone a loud like Boug Powell.
They prefer to ignore the fact

that slavery went out with the
civil war. They try to pan their
financial stupidity off on the
players, or perhaps even lie to
them and the public, by pleading
poverty.

Well the players won't buy it,
and neither will the fans. The
fact is that what is good for the

fans is best for basede. The fans
will not pay to see minor
leaguers. The fans want spring
training, not excuses. The fans
want to talk deals, not dollars.
The fans want a full season, a
real pennant race, and a real
World Series.

Last year, the fans lost
interest, the owners lost money,
and the players lost spring
training and several crucial
games. If you put these facts
together. my dear Mr. Kuhn,
you and your cronies will realize
that another strike would be a.
disaster for baseball -- perhaps
the Final Disaster!

So let‘s get the lockout over,
the contract settled, spring
training started, and Beene back
on the pitchers' mound. The
players are right, and Kuhn and
Company know it.
