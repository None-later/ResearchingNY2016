by Ann E. Bunker

Two lines on Dutch Quad-
rangle bring to a total of five the
number of fires on campus
within the past two weeks.

Residents of Van Cortlaridt
Hall were roused early last
Friday morning in response to a
fire in that dorm. The blaze was
contained in a trash hopper iii
the basement and was quickly
extinguished by the sprinkler
system. No cause has been deter-
tiiiried for the blaze.

Sunday evening. residents of
Stuyvesant Tower were forced to
evacuate dtie to a blale in that
dorm. Reportedly the fire was
caused by a Irotplate and was
confined to a closet. Damage to
the room was not extensive btrt
several articles of clothing were
destroyed.

IRAr

by Dennis Pahl

 

On Thursday, February 15,
SUNY at Albany presented Eoin
O Murchu speaking in LC 24 on
the conﬂict in Northern Ireland.
The major emphasis of his lec-
ture centered upon British ini-
perialistn and the treatment of
Northern Ireland as a iieo-colony
of Great Britain: a neo-colony
being a country which has been
given political independence
while still under the throes of
economic domination.

Iioin 0 Murchu is the director
of publicity for the Irish Repub-
licaii Army tIRA). lIe is also the
editor of the IRA theoretical
rotiriials. After graduation from
ilre University of Drtbliri, Ire
became active in the IRA and
newspapers which were pro-
nationalist.

Ile began his lecture stressing
the point that ltl\ analysis of the

Speuke

Irish conflict would not be ob-
jective, ﬁrmly convinced that
the IRA is in the Right! The
IRA, O Murchu explained, is
fighting British imperialism' in
the name of the working people
of Northern Ireland and those
oppressive forces, industrial and '
financial monopolies and the
British government, which ex-
ploit the farmers, small business
men, and workers of Ireland.

0 Murchu emphasized time
and again that Britain is leading
a terrorizing campaign to stir
sectarian confrontations be-
tween Protestants and Catholics.
Much of the bloodshed he said,
Iias been the doings of British
soldiers disguised at times in
civilian clothes. The Britiin so|<
diets are enforcing the desires of
the British government to divide
the Northern Irelaiidcrs along
religious litres and blind them to
their real interest u national iri-
tlcpcrideiicc. Ile calls the sol-

diers, “a repressive instrument
that terrorizes the people." The
presence of a police state in
Northern Ireland he says is part
of Britain's “imperialist plan to
control the wealth of Ireland.”
The IRA‘s primary function is
to provide leadership in political
organization and to provide the
necessary action that will guaran-
tee the rights of the Irish masses
to control their own flow of
capital. 0 Murchu tried to dis-
pell the myth that the Irish
Republican Army was totally
representative of the Catholic
mirrorin in Northern Ireland. He
implied that there is a great
amount of Protestant members
in the IRA by claiming that he
only knew of “a handful of
(‘atholics in the IRA." Ile said
that the suggestion that the IRA
is aligned with the (‘atholic
cause is one more example of
British propaganda aimed at dis-
rtriittiig the Iiisli workers.

After recounting a history of

British attempts at obliterating
the national consciousness and
culture of Ireland, 0 Murchu
bitterly described the effects of
British imperialism. In the last
five to ten year span, 300,000
jobs were lost in Northern Ire-
land, Due to the rapid rise in
unemployment thousands were
driven from their homes and
emigrated.

The blame must be placed on
imperialism, 0 Murchu con-
firmed; the movement of capital
invested abroad by big business-
men iti Ireland who have "deals"
with Britain. They seek higher
and quicker returns in invest-
ments from abroad rather than
investing in Ireland for home
development. “As the resources
ﬂow out so do the people."

'l‘hotigh Great Britain does

chu claitited other foreign mori-
opolies add their share to dis-

rupting Irish nationalism. Gov-
ernments and monopolies repre-
sented by the Common Market
who dominate the economies of
underdeveloped nations, and the
US. (the Mobile Corp. for in-
stance) were examples of these
disruptive forces.

0 Murchu concluded his lec-
ture by debasing the British tac-
tics employed to promote sec-
tarianism. He re-emphasized his
abhorrence for British measures
by saying sardonically that
“they only murder children be-
tween the ages of five and nine
and old men between the ages of
60 and 70, Catholic as well as
Protestants."

Tire people of Ireland. he said,
Iiave two choices: “we can gro-
vcl until we die, or fight back."

IRA as the “first scientific soc-
ialist organization in Ireland."
