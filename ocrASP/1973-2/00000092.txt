Although the petitions backing
Waterman were signed by over
2300 students, the letter writing

somewhat more effective. Accor-

people more aware of the issue."
The letters, on the other hand,

persuaded the administrators
that tltere were cogent reasons
for keeping Waterman.

Another boon to the students‘
efforts was the publishing of the
“Waterman papers" in the ASP

were letters of transmittal writ-

Dollar Finds it Rough Going

by Fred Coleman Associated
Press Writer

LONDON AP - Is the French
franc next? or the British
pound? or even the dollar again?

The dollar crisis of the past
two weeks appears to have died
down after President Nixon‘s
second devaluation in 14
months, As in childbirth, the
second devaluation could well
prove easier.

But money markets around the
world are still nervous A major
worry is not whether there will
be another round of monetary
turmoil but when.

Some money managers are
already trying to decide which
currency will bear the brunt of
the next attack on world mone-
tury stability.

“’Ihc dollar is not out of the
Woods yet," a foreign exchange
dealer here said Saturday.

Governments and businessmen
generally agree that only
sweeping reforms of the inter-
national tradt- and monetary
system can stop the pattern of
recurring money crises of recent
years.

But they also concede that any
agrccnivnt on such reforms
could he yt-ars away, Morr-
troublc is Iil-tt-ly first.

Part of thc gloom comes from
the link between monetary and
tradc prolilctns.

'I'Iit- world's major trading
nations ang-t-d last week on a
ll“\\’ wt of exchange rates for
lIlt‘ll‘ money, adjusted to the
tit-w dollar devaluation. But they
still must discuss the related
problem of trade restrictions.

some European officials see
the dollar devaluation as only

the first round in a protracted
struggle ovcr trade questions
that could l‘lld iii a three-way
tradc way involving the United

States, Wt'hii‘l’n Europe, and
Japan.

And any trade war psychology
would rcnt-w pressure on money
markets, restarting the same old
longvplaying record.

Perhaps worse, some officials
IJI’IIPVI‘, each monetary or trade
crisis makt‘s the overall problem
that lllut‘Il harder to solve.

For the moment. however, thi-
experts still appear to bc digi-s
ting the implications of last
week's (It-Valuation. The seeds of
the crisis stretch hack years

This gap, or (Il‘fll'll, made the

many and Japan.

 

it was the deﬁcit that even-
tually induced President Nixon
to devalue the dollar in
December, 1971. Devaluation
was supposed to make American
goods cheaper abroad, increase
export sales and eventually erase
the deﬁcit. It didn’t work.

American ofﬁcials argue that
the devaluation wasn't big
enough and that foreing trade re-
strictions in Europe and Japan
prevented the desired trade tum-
around. By the end of 1972 the
deﬁcit had swelled and touched
off the crisis that began
February 1.

As in every monetary crisis
since the British devaluyinn of
November, 1967, the probiam
soon grow too hot to be handled
in old-fashioned ways. In the old
days governments could simply
issue statements denying the
crisis, promise to defend existing
exchange rates, and put down
speculative attacks. No longer.

In the mid-1960's, the big,
American—owned international
companies found it more
profitable to leave the dollars
they earned Eu rope. The fund of
these so-called ‘Eurodollars‘ has
grown to $70 billion. the biggest
intcmational moncy p00| in “1,.
world.

'l'rcasuros of international com-
panies reasoned that with the
Unites States in deficit and West
Germany in surplus, the mark
would go up iii any currency
realignment, and the dollar
down.

So they sold dollars and
bought marks. And they did this
in such volume that eventually
they forced their bet into a
winner. The only way to run on
the dollar was another devalu»
ation, the Nixon administration
decided.

’l‘hc devaluation was arranged
in little more than a weekend by
Paul Volcker, undersecretary 0f
the Treasury, ﬂying an Air Force
presidential plane to Europe and
Japan.

Dcvaluation steadied the dollar
at new exchange rates. The
selling of dollars stopped. Conﬁ-
dcncc began to return. But the
trouble was not ovor.

Strikes and other economic
troubles were pushing the British
pound down. French national
elections next month were.

crisis, experts said.

Prime Minister Edward Heath
of Britain, among other leaders,
stressed that the ﬁrst priority
now Shauld be to reform the
whole international monetary
system

The dollar, Heath argued,
could no longer adequately
ﬁnance world trade as a reserve
currency.

Others quarreled with the
whole idea of fixed exchange
rates.

Different countries have dif-
ferent business cycles, election
timetables, labor relations,
inﬂation rates and so on. Each
of these factors is bound to
affect the value of money sooner
or later. Opponents of—ﬁxedl—
rates argue that. they can only"
stay realistic for a short time.
Sooner or later one or more gets
out of line, becomes subject to
speculative attack and another
crisis is on.

An alternative to fixed rates
would be ﬂoating ones, moving
up and down according to the
supply or demand for any
particular currency. Britain,
Japan, Italy, Switzorland and
Canada are all floating now. But.
businessmen generally dislike
floats. It its harder to arrange
contracts without knowing what
the price will be on the date of
sale.

So debate on these and other
questions continue in the
attempt to reform the whole
system. The threat of another
money crisis is never far away.
