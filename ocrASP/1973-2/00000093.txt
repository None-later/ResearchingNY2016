Correspondent

SAIGON AP - The Hanoi Hil-
ton in North Vietnam no doubt
deserved its nickname. “the Hell
Hole.’ but. in the words of an
army adviser held less than a
year in the South, jungle
confinement by the Viet Cong
was ‘ilie ultimate bunimer.‘

Information pieced together
from the 15.8. prisoners released
from the North and South so
far. plus their general condition,
confirms Capt. George Wanat‘s
verdict that imprisonment by
the \'C was ‘a hard piece of
cheese.‘

Wanat, from Waterford. Conn.,
spent the first five months of his
10-month captivity alone
chained in a snake and ant
infested bamboo cage. living on
one bowl of rice a day and
occasionally some bread and
pork fat.

His father. who talked to him
by telephone at Clark Field. said
“'anat's body was so distended
from malnutrition and bouts of
malaria he could not yet wear
Western-ster clothes.

The 27 men brought out of the
jungles in Loc Ninh, 75 miles
north of Saigon, to board the
American helicopters looked dif-
ferent. dressed differently and
acted differently than tl’itist‘ rc-
leztsed in Hanoi.

For one thing. thcy hardly
knew each other. They stood
there awkwardly iii tht-ii' grct-n
Viet Cong pajamas and Ho (Tlii
Minh sandals making shy iiiiro
ductions.

‘It looked Ilkt‘ an attempt had
been made to fattcn lhi-m up a
little in a hell of a hurry" said a
senior L' S. offici‘r who went to
help \tll'l oltt Illt'
bureaucratic in-fightiiig betwt-cii
the Viet Cong and the South
Vietnamese that delaycd the rte
lease ll hours.

The prisoners wcrcn't sup~
posed to reveal much about their
confinement. but little by liitlc.
grim details have slipped out.

POW’s [Survived Malaria, Starvation

They had survived on stew
made of rats and dogs, and some
had eaten tiger and elephant
meat.

Chief warrant officer James
Hestand, a helicopter pilot from
Oklahoma City, had dropped
from 160 to 107 pounds in 1.3
months of iungle captivity.

S. Sgt. Bobby Johnson of
Detroit, a prisoner of the Viet
Cong for nearly five years,
looked as if his gaunt frame
could barely support the weight
of the hospital bathrobe draped
over his shoulders.

Mrs. George Waldhaus of Pitts-
burg, Calif., gasped when she
caught sight of her 25 year old
son Richard after a fourvyear
absence.

‘I didn't even recogniZe him,‘
she said, almost in tears. ‘He
used to have a round, fat.
chubby l'ace.‘ Civilian Richard
Waldhaus, the mystery man
among the prisoners released by
the Viet Cong, stepped off a
plane in San Francisco barefoot,
holding a pink Carnation and
murmuring ‘Love, peace' after
US, embassy officials whisked
him secretly out of Saigon.

strong camp organization headed
by senior officers, that kept
them mentally and physically
alert with classes, exercise, even
some feeble attempts at home

entertainment.

In the bamboo cages of the
south, the men were usually
alone, moved often to avoid B52
strikes, traveling mostly on foot,
living the mole‘s life of their
guerrilla captors, sleeping on the
ground or in hammocks.

The general condition reflected
where they had been.

Most of those coming home
from the Hanoi Hilton were
pilots or air crew members. In a
large part, those with injuries or
deformaties suffered them in
ejecting from their aircraft or in
parachuting into heavy canopy
jungles.

Flight surgeons always give this
last bit of advice to pilots taking
off on a mission: ‘Beforc

Bette Midler tit RPI

Bette Midler sings rock ‘n‘ roll,
torch songs, rhythm ‘n‘ blues,
just plain old time blues, sophis-
ticated show tunes, and lots of
nostalgic musical trash. turning
through sheer talent brassy
oldies into pure gold.

Skipping across the stage in
wedgies or plastic sling backs,
punctuating words with fingers
tracing designs in the air, Bette
creates choreography out. of
body-English. The tiny (6 foot,
1-inch), red haired fireball of
energy is enthusiastically and
aptly called "The Divine Miss
M” by her fans. Besides being
divine, she’s also sexy, sassy, sad,
bawdy, outrageous, funny, im-
peccably musical and above all
approachably human.

make her album one of the
biggest—selling debuts of the

Iri‘J-t, and the controversy it has aroused, it has held a prominent
plat-c in the rcpcrtory of tlic I‘iiiglish-spctiking stagc.

In this play nothing works out as the romantics say it should. But
the style is necessarily romantic to dramatize thc ludicrousniass of
the charactch and the Siluitlltlnh,'tlllll Show manages to rationalize
cvrirything into a romantic scheme-e even his socialistic vicws are
assimilated into dramatically t-ffiictivc characters and situations.

serious points to IJI’. made about such things as the absurdity of war
