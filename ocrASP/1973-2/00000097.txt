by Bill Heller

The season‘s never over for the
Albany State basketball team.
They are a proud bunch who
never give up and always give
100‘}.

Let‘s look at the record. After
handily beating a poor Oswego
team. Doc Sauers and the Al-
bany Great Danes recorded their
18th straight non-losing year. At
home. where a majority of the
Albany fans get their only look
at the Danes. they have won 26
of their last 27.

The Danes are not an average
team - they did not play over
their heads against Brockport or
Potsdam or anyone else. They
simply played up to their-poten-
tial. It's a big difference.

So. they have played inconsis-
tent on the road. Inconsistent.
and not poorly. For they did
beat Siena. Union, and Fredonia
away. Does their inconsistency
mark them as only an average
team'.’ Or are they a very good
team. who simply didn't hit

their potential in some away
games?

I took these questions to Doc
Saueis.

ASP: Is this an average team?

Sauers: “This team is like a
little girl. When she’s good she’s
very, very good. And when she's
had. she's horrid."

ASP: Have we played over our
heads at times. or rather. up to
our potential?

Sauers: “We’re absolutely as
good as any team (including the
University of Buffalo) we've
faced this year. There's no ques-
tion about it. We‘ve got the
personnel." ASP: What has gone
wrong?

Sauers: “Our defense has been
terrible. That's why we've been
losing. We scored enough points
against Siena and Plaittsburgh to
win. Teams were better prepared
for us this year than last. Poten—
tially. we are better than our
record. In many ways. maybe we
aren‘t tough enough. If so. it‘s
my fault for not making them
tougher."

ASP: What can you do for the
remaining games?

Sauers: “We don't have much
practice time. We just have to

'lay the facts on the table and
hope the team has the pride to
respond."

ASP: Do you think the sea-
son's over?

Sauers: “No - it's never over.
We'll be giving it our best the
rest of the way."

*****#‘###¥#****

On Saturday night,in front of a
poor crowd of maybe 1,500. the
Danes completely outplayed the
Oswego Lakeis. 81'50. The
Danes started slow and then
burned up leads of 9-2. 15-8.
23-l2. 31-13. and finally 41-19
at the half. Byron Miller was
ridiculous in the first half, scor-
ing 14 on a 6-7 performance
from the field. Albany shot 56%
in the first stanza. and then ran
away in the second half.

In the end. everybody scored
for the Great Danes: Byron-18.
John Quattrocchi < 9. Werner
Kolln. Bob Rossi. Harry Johnson

and Reggie Smith - 8. Dave
Welchons and Dennis Terry - 6.
Bob Curtiss and Jerry Hoffman -
4, and Felton Hyche-Z. Needless
to say. it was a balanced attack.

Besides Miller. Dennis Terry put
in a good showing. as did Jerry

Hoffman. Troch looked rejuven-
ated, playing his fine D., as did
the whole squad. Also, Dave
Welchons really did a fine job at
both ends of the court. It was a
runaway, but a nice game to
show one and all that “it's never
over."

What a Difference a Year Makes; wreﬂler's Finish 4th

"by Kenneth Arduino

One year ago, at the SUNY
Wrestling _Championships, the
Great Danes scored 14% pts. and
finished seventh.

One year ago. the Danes were
headed for a 6-5-1 season in dual
meets.

One year ago. Rudy Vido
broke his foot and missed the
championship.

One year ago. Larry Mims was
injured in the Very first round.

, . -3 > ,s _.

 

    

One year ago. Jeff Albrecht
was just getting back from a
broken leg.

One year ago. Walt Katz.
Ethan Grossman. Frank Herman
and Jim Dickson were not on
the team.

One year ago. Albany's highest
finishers were fourth place.

But this is not last year. The
Albany team this year went to
the Championships to regain
some lost respect. Albany fin-
ished fourth. with 61 pts. Lead-

i

Blown. y

ing the grapplers were Rudy
Vido and Larry Mims. but it was
a total team effort.

Albany‘s one champion was
Rudy Vido. Rudy seeded fourth
in the heavyweight class. despite
his 8-1-1 record. was sensational.
He won his first match 6-3. then
beat the previously unbeaten
number one seed. In the finals
Rudy had to beat the number
two seed. a local boy from Pots-
(lum. Even with the crowd
against him, Rudy would not be
denied winning I 1-7.

Coach Garcia praised Rudy.
pointing out that in high school
Rudy could muscle his way to
victory. Now. with the hpr of
wrestler Don Mimi and Coach
Peterson. he has been able to
learn how to wrestle. Rudy still
has not reached his peak.

Inirry Mims, who was the
second sccd. pinncd his first
opponent and mchd into the
finals \Vllll a second win. Larry
l'accd llic number one scctl and
was hciilcn liil.

.lcl'f Albrecht coiiliiiiicd his
hard luck. as lll' was injurcd.
Yet. lii- wa. able to win two
matches and finish fourth.

'l'oni llorn. seeded only fifth
npscl the number four seed from
lii‘iickpoi'l in ovr-rlintv. Unfor-
tunalcly 'l'oni like many other
Albany wrcstlcrs drcw lhc num-
bcr oni- sccd for lhc second
round. mi was beaten but
(‘zillll' buck and won his next two
mntchcs to clinch lliiril.

  

  

 

Freshman Walt. Katz. won his
first match with a pin but was
beaten by the number two seed.
Katz was beaten 4-0 for third.

Albany had to fight the seeds
all evening as they were seeded
low despite some good wrestlers.
It was a credit to Albany to do
so well despite the seeds.

Doug Bauer easily won his
opening match but ended up
fourth for the second straight
year. Frank Herman and Jim
Dickson both were beaten by

number one seeds and finished
fourth.

Garcia summed it up "They
(the wrestlers) did a hell of a
job." The goal this year was to
improve on the seventh place
finish and it was reached. Garcia
felt that with a few breaks Al-
bany might have pulled out
third.

Albany's last home match is
this Wednesday at 7:30. Come
out and support the most im-
proved team this winter.
