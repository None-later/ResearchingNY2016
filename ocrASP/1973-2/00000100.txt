_ ' Students-Speak Out on Tnure C

CIII’I Smith:

by Chris Masteison and
Stacey Jar-it

The tenure case of Curt Smith.
a member of SUNYA’s English
Department. recalls the cases of
other professors in various
departments at tlte university
this year.

There are supporters who al»
ledge the professor is qualified.
There is a bureaucracy that has
rendered decisions more negative
than positive. And there is a man
on the way out.

It has become a familiar tale.

The specific tenure case of
Curt Smith began ‘drawing atten-
tion several weeks ago when the
professor decided to present new
evidence to Acting Engliin De-
partment Chairman. Donald
Stauffer v evidence that. he felt.
would benefit his catise and did
eventually lead to a second vote

The ﬁrst vote by department
members ended in a 20-20 dead-

'lock. The second tipped the

scales to Smith by a vote of
35-l9.

It was the latter vote that
buoyed the hopes of Smith's
supporters. The elation was to
be short-lived because Acting
Chairman Stauffer soon respond-
ed with a negative recommenda-
tion.

And the case began its aScent
through the multi-Iayered bu-
reaticracy.

Interested students visited With
Ruth Schmidt, Associate Dean
of the College of Arts and Sci
ences, to discuss the case. Her
recommendation. ultimately.
was a positive one.

I. Moyer IIunsbcrgcr. Dean of
the College of Arts and Sciences.
was the tiext recipient of Smith's
case. The Arts and Sciences
Committee discussed the merits
of gratitiiig Smith tenure after
professors from teaching at the
same institution from which
they received their doctorate.
This policy has recently come to
light as Mr. Alan Wheelock, an
instructor in the English Depart
ment. is obtaining his doctoral
degree from SUNYA at the end
of this semester.

Allegedly for this reason. Mr.
Wheelock can no longer teach
Albany State students, but It]-
stead must find employment

hearing Smith and one of his
former students — Michael Lipp-
man — speak and ﬁeld a variety
of questions.

The vote of that committee
composed of both faculty and
students, brought more bad
news. It was uniformly negative.

Smith was told Dean Huns-
berger's recommendation and an
explanation of the committee‘s
vote would be forthcoming.

As of this writing. it has not
been received, and Hunsberger
could not be reached for official
comment.

While they watched and waited.
the supporters of Smith met to
review the evtdetice of his case.
They feel he is qualified because
of the interest his courses getter-
atc among the student body,
because they claim be ranked
fourth among members of the
English Department last year in
publications and awards and. fi»
nally, because of his “continurng

A group of concerned students

of such a fine teacher Marty
Schaffer, a spokesman for the
group. ridiculed the policy as a
silly bureaucratic tradition and
stated that Wheclock's teaching
effectiveness is “too good to give
up." And when speaking to the
many students who have taken
Wheelock's courses. thcre scents
to be a feeling of near unanimity

porters say, is mirrored in his

number of “professionals who
seek his work and advice."

But his backers are uncertain

mental policy of not coritiiiutiig
the employment of instructors
who have received their doctor
ates from the same university is
the entire basis for not consi-
dering Wheelock‘s appointment.
Furthermore, Stauffer agreed
that this is a good policy as it
would create an “unhealthy
situation" for both the profcssor
and the university as a whole if
there was not a transfer of stu-
dents lo another college when
they began to teach. Ruth
Schmidt, Associate Dean of Arts
and Science, Division of Human-
itics, concurred Dean Schmidt
stated that this policy prevented
what is known as “inbreeding”

mind of the professor as well.

The Heartbreak Kid

If you‘re in the mood to
interview a prodigy, you might
try to talk to Jeffrey Soreff;
Jeffrey is a student at Harvard
University who enrolled there
last full -- at the age of 13.

As the youngest student in
Harvard history. obviously
Jeffrey has been bombarded
With questions and interview re-
quests from numerous reporters.
As a result. he has apparently
decided not to talk to any mem-
ber of the press whatsoever.
According to Boston's Real Pa~
[)1'r. the llut‘l'dt‘fl Crimson is the
last iwvvspaper to havr- caught
Jeffrt-y off guard: it interviewed
Iiim briefly last fall, and than
prisst-d along some of his
thoughts.

Jt-l'fri-y reported that he was
ll‘lit‘lll. upon developing a heart

attack machine which he said
would use microwaves (quote)
“to induce a heart attack at a
distance." He is said to have
explained that you could use the
device to eliminate popular poli-
tical leaders without making
martyrs out of them. Jeffrey is

reported to have told thoCrr’mr

son (quote) this would he a
useful way of slowing down a
movement."

The 13-year-old is said also to
have explained that he plans to
join such diverse groups as
S.I).S.. Young Americans for
Freedom, the Young Democrats
and the Young Republicans.
Said the Harvard freshman:
(quote) "It's not that I agree
with them, but I would like to
get a sampling of their psycho-
Iogtes."--Zodiuc
