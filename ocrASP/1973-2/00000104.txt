Dcur Ask the Asp,

Everyone has been writing to
you about problems with their
boy friends or roommate‘s girl-
friend. What do you do with a
suitemate who thinks she’s a
monkey? She lurches through
the dorm making obscene noises
and the suite constantly reeks of
bananas. This isn't the worst
part . . .how can anyone take a
shower while "The Ape-Woman"
is swinging on the shower rod,
screaching at the top of her
lungs.

This is not a put-on. We really
can‘t even bring friends into the
suite because she harasses them.
And dinner is a total disaster
--wii.h her puwing through her
food looking for edible morsels.

We have tried to reason with
her, to no avail. We like her
«amt-limes she keeps us enlerA
tamed. But life lh’ miserable. We
all can't move out of the suite-
--and who would take an Ape-
wuman in as a suite-male? What
can We do? We have no cage! if
you don't belich this letter is
sincere. you can contact anyone
in Melville-Steinmth and they
wrll verify this complaint. We are
g(riol w )ing bananas.

Sincerely yours,

The Second Dawn

Dear N.N.,

If you’re sure every way of
reasoning with her has been
attempted, perhaps you should
try ignoring her. A bit of cold
treatment and she might realize
what she’s doing. You say she
keeps you entertained. Perhaps
(consciously or unconsciously)
you are encouraging her to con-
tinue her antics. In which case,
not paying attention to her
actions may at least persuade her
to tone down a bit.

PS. We think you should take
our advice because a situation
like this iii nothing to "monkey"
around with.

Dear Ask the Asp.

Most of my childhood close
friends were the kind who never
stopped talking about them-
selves, always enjoyed bragging;
in general, they could never do
enough to build themselves up in
the eyes of other people. As a
result. I have grown to dislike
people who talk about them-
selves (or at leiisl be wary of
those pciiplc), especially if they
scum to be saying how good
they are. how smart they are,
how cool they are, etc.

Fortunately i've found that
With my better friends this
doesn't mailer too much. be-
cause I see enough of them to
form my own opinions, anrl i

also see them when they talk
about other things. Recently I've
found a situation where this
dislike of people has struck very
close to home. Namely, in job
interviews, 1 have been having to
talk about my experience, edu-
cation. qualifications, etc. This
makes me very uncomfortable,
as you can probably imagine.
The worst situations are where I
think .I have some good points in
relation to the job being dis-
cussed. (Bu‘ildina myself up in
other words). That really makes
me squirm. Do you have any
suggestions as to how I can feel
comfortable talking about my-
self?
Thank you very much.
"Self-umbivilized"

Dear "Self-ambivilized",

The line between conceit and
self-confidence is narrow, but
you must realize that there is a
distinction. And your aim is to
gain more self-confidence in
speaking. Perhaps your best
course of action would be
through those better friends you
mention. If you can discuss the
problem with them. you will
liaVc made the first. step in talk-
ing to others about yourself.
Remember, they will not take
wlial. you say as bragging about
yourself . . . they are close to
you and know better. When you
find that you can talk com-
fortably about yourself to your
best friends, the transition to
talking at Job interviews should
be easier.
