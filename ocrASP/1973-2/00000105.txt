Ross Hunter’s “Airport”

by Larry Menkes

The producer, Ress Hunter,
brings to life Arthur Hailey‘s
best-selling novel Airport. He has
brought together twenty—three
aeademy-award-winnlng actress!
es and actors. “Airport” is a
powerful suspense drama that
takes place at night during a
seven-hour period while air inter-
national airport in the midwest
is plagued by a crippling bliz-
zard. A mired airplane is block-
ing a vital runway and a second

jetliner is trying to limp back
home after surviving a mid-air
bomb blast, The audience will
feel the jarring tension of the
explosion as if experiencing it
first-hand.

The film revolves around the
contrasting roles of the charac-
ters both at the airport and in
their personal lives. The charac-
ters each stand at the critical
point of their personal lives and
the decisions which they must
make are made in the tension-
fiIIed setting of the airport. Larch
decision that they make will
have serious repercussions on the
lives and the decisions ol the
others.

The characters are familiar
ones, brii the perlorinarrces of
the cast make them rare. Helen
Hayes. as the innocent old lady.
has once again proveii that she is
indeed the first lady of show
business. She extsts in her own
oblivrous arid happy world. The
methods of world-wide travel
which she uses are only outdone
by her description of them to
Mel Bakersfeld and his assistant
(Jean Seaberg).

Dean Martin, as Bern Denier-

est, the pilot of the bomb-
injured jetliner is seen in a role
far removed from his Thursday
night boozr: sessions on NBC. He
exhibits a great degree of sensi-
tivity in dealing with his preg-
nant mistress, who is also his
stewardess, as well as the passen-
gersfor whom he is responsible,

Burt Lancaster‘s performance
of Mel Bakersfeld is of the same
caliber as his academy-
award-wtnning portrayal of "I51-
mer Gantry." His “the-hell-
wrth<you" attitude earns the
audience's respect and tttItllltil‘
tioii In his role. one sees the
probleriis of a man confronted
by adversity on all sides a man
watching his life crumble around
Illlll.

The Director (icorgc Scum”
used a refrigeration system and
other techniques on the set (lur-
ing the filming to make the
conditions as real as possible

by Bill Brine

A recurrent problem that all
reviewers must live with is the
threat of creeping stalencss: one
hears so much that is so similar
(and of so little worth) that soon
the ability to react with
unalloyed enthusiasm to a new
artist gets frayed away. It‘s
doubly delightful, then to herald
the debut ofa new artist (new to
Ameriwm ears, at any rate)
who’s simply brillartt. The
man’s name is John Martyn &
his album Solid Air (Island
SW9325, distributed by Capitol
Records) is simply one of the
best (and most totally
unexpected)releases of |‘)7_i,
The packaging is stunning; the
songs (mostly original) (In;

arrangements — particularly of
Danny Thompson’s double bass
and of John “Rabbit”
Bundrick’s keyboards — are just
perfectly right

With the proper exposure and
intelligent promotion, John Martyn
could be a full-ﬂedged star.
However, Island will have to do
more for him than they’ve done
so far: he's been ‘packaged' on a
tour with Free & Traffic. The
former is a prototypical English
hard-rock baird (albeit with an
occasional gift for producing
interesting music) and the latter
is a once-outstanding super-band
fallen on hard times lately. so
John's in danger of getting lost
in the shufﬂe for a while yet.
lint fear not; someday,
somehow, Martyn just has to
break through.
