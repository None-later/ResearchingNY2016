Art Blasts Gunny

To the editor:

A comment in Tuesday’s ASP. "One
traditionally now speaks of a film as an
art form, which is a ridiculous term,"
intrigues me

I have no idea whether Professor Gunn
was quoted correctly or not. I do admit
that "the art" of anything may be ridicu—
lous. but [am convinced there is an art to
ﬁlm. as there is to music, painting, and
other creative fields.

In my humble opinion. if cinema is not
an art form. then there are no art forms.

Bad Marx

To the editor:

I hardly expect students to make every
tenure fight close. After all, what good
does it do‘.’ Some students and reporters
beat their brains out to save Waterman
and before anybody can own get back to
classes this ('url Smith case comes along
What's tiie use 7 you can't win them all,
can you’.’ And the ones you lose. .Weil,
there are a lot of good teachers looking
for it job.

Many of those teachers undoubtedly
bothered Certain faculty and administra‘
tors at other uniVersities the way Curt
iinseltles some people here. And Curt is
only a Marxist. The unemployment line is
a haven for subversives; out there
searching for a classroom are anarchists
and Republicans and worse Smith is
lucky he's had a Job as long as he has.

Yet still, if uobpdy has enough energy
to '.\‘t'tit‘ letters, or Visit some of tlic
people along the decisiorrmaking route,
can’t we at least force those people to
make a pretense of logic in this action - to
take enough notice of us to take a little
care" We are as yet uninformed as to
which of the five criteria conCi-rning
tenure Smith failed to meet, and I think
we can assume that his superb student
evaluations are not at the root of the
problem for II. u again, maybe they
are ). So why then must We lose (.‘urt
Smith?

As the largest part of this university, the
sludents, there are hundreds of questions
We put forward that are never quite fully
answered. This is a question we should
persist in uiilil we get a satisfactory
response.

What Did You Say?

To the editor:

Recently, the Speech Pathology Club
and the Audiology Club of SUNYA spuri-
sored a hearing clinic, the proceeds of
which were to benefit Telethon i wish
more students had taken the advantage of
this opportunity to haVe their ears tested.

their hearing This problem becomes pur-
ticulariy acute the later it is iii the

What I am referring to is the magnitude
of the noise pollution contributed by a
multitude of stereos, radios. and other
means of communication. During the day
and the early part of the evening it is not
so bad since, I have learned to think and
write in lime to the music [the faster the

An Offer Not to Refuse

To the editor:

I am writing concerning a problem
which affects those of us who use the
library extensively. 'I‘lianks to the prolifv
cration of zimatuer Mafiuso who wtult in
ripping off books. pickets, etc,, from
persons using the library - articles which
they may not need or ever use n those of
us who have a great deal of research to do
are forced to carry about with us our
coats, text books, notebooks, etc., when
we are searching for library materials.
While it is but a minor inconvenience, it is
an inconvenience. I prefer to concentrate
Upt my research witliotil the encumber-
aii apparel designed for 20 degree
ten ures draped about me in a 75
degree library. I prefer to have the free-
dom to make notes or to utilize the
books of the library without the incon—
venience of carrying about notebooks and
various other articles which may or may
not pertain to the research at hand.

As I know of no committee to which i
might appeal, I am writing to the ASP to
suggest that somewhere in the library --
perhaps in the downstairs hallways or in
the lobbies -- lockers he installed of the
variety in use in the bookstore (25 cents,
refundable). This would allow the users
to store their temporarily unneeded para-
phernalia and to concentrate on the
matter at hand: their education. Thank
you.

Vietnam has long been called a conflict

our hunger for “news” will probably keep
him from ever leading a normal life.

The network news teams have become
experts at on-the-spot reporting. Anchor
men learned their mindless banter by
reading and rereading press releases while
our astronauts cruised through space. in
Dallas and Memphis and Les Angclca they
learned to be solemn and somber during
on-the-spot live coverage of a death.
State funerals were covered with the
same thoroughness as the Thanksgiving
Day Parade. The same concerned team

It's it good thing we woke up in time to

it a shame that LBJ, who strove so
valiantly for peace, should kick off just
before the documents were signed? Of
course all the networks had a half hour
obituary in the can and ready to roll.
After shedding tears for our former
president, we watched a “recap” of the
war which had just ended. Back to the
days of body counts, we got to see again
the man whose mother watched him die
on the tube. His body went into a plastic
bag much like the one we throw garbage
in, (And don’t miss the fifteen part series
that probes the breakup of an American
family.)

Hundreds of thousands of men were
allowed to return from Vietnam anon-
ymously, to become vets on college
campuses and construction sites, in unem-
ployment lines and offices. Our returning
prisoners should be allowed to go home
without the crass eye of the television on
their front door.

Horse Tenure
To the editor:

Tenure and promotion cases have lie-
cuinii part of the staple diet of the ASP
lately, and i fear that the righteous
indignation which greeted the earlier
cases may come to be replaced by a

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

 

passive acceptance of the inevitable. The
firing of superior teachers now occurs
with the monotonous regularity of coups
in Argentina. This week's head on the
block belongs to Alan Wheeloek of the
English Dept. His crime is that he is a
graduate student of this school (presently
completing his dissertation). The English
Dept. has a policy against hiring its own
graduates, (which seems to indicate some
sort of lack of faith in the department‘s
own products), but Mr. Wheeiack de-
serves to be an exception to this policy.
Alan Wheelock is one of those rare
teachers who is worth getting up in the
morning for. His lectures are consistently
interesting, even when they concern
basically dull material. The backgrouan
information that he gives his classes
makes it clear that he is both extremely
well-read and a painstaking researcher. Ht.-
shows a very broad range of knowictlge
beyond his particular field of study, and
he constantly relates the subject matter
to larger realms and concerns. He is
conspicuously lacking in the egomania
which infects some of SUNYA’s more
distinguished scholars: the benign sages
who stand impregnabie behind their wall
of erurlition, occasionally stiﬂing a
chuckle at the ignorance of humanity.
Wheelock remains e approachable.

t2

 

Tenure is not what he is asking for,
either, but merely a renewal of contract
until he comes up for tenure in 2 years.
He has certainly earned this much.

Sinner Repent

To the editor:

Wednesday evening, Feb. 7, Robert B.
Saltzman of the Ci‘lAprt-senled a program
about the assassination at President
Kennedy to a capacity house in LG 7.
Part of Mr. Salt'Lman's presentation was a
display of books written about the assas-
sination and related events.

Last night i received a phone call froin
Mr. Suitzman (i had made the arrange
ments for the lecture) and was informed
by him that he found one or two of the
books missing from his collection when he
was preparing to speak at Skidmarc this
past Monday night. Since he hadn‘t un-
packed this material since his appearance
in Albany the previous Wednesday, it is
obvious that some person or persons (a
conspiracy perhaps?) made off with the
books from LC 7 here at SUNYA.

Needless to say, Saltzman is distressed
by this state of affairs as these books are
virtually irreplaceable since they are out
of print, not to mention the fact that
they provide him with information and
material for his work.

in this regard he asked me to make a
plea to those involved in the larceny to
please return the books-Arm questions
asked. A reasonable procedure would be
to IeaVe them lit the Campus Center
information desk. if that seems too in
timidating. ii phone call to me (472-640(3)
arranging a pick-up spot would be fine
Another option would be to send them
directly to him. The address lit: Robert ii.
Hallmriiin, (J’i‘iA, PO. Box 766,
Schenectady, NY. 12301.

The important thing is for him to get
his books back, I repeat that there will be

no i-iiibiirriissment to those involved; and
1 Would urge those responsible to comply
with this request as soon as possible,
