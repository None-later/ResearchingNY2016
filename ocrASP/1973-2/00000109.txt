The Hawks from New Paltz
were shot down before they
could ever get off the ground
Wednesday night. when the
Albany State matmen hunted
them down by the score of 44-0.

it was evident early that it was
the night for the Danes. Ex-
pecting to lose the 118 lb. class
via a forfeit, (due to an injury to
Walt Katz) the Danes received
the good news that New Paltz
was also going to forfeit it,
along with 126 lbs. and heavy-
weight. The l'orfeit in the heavy-
weight division was a disappoint-
ment to the crowd who wanted
to see SUNY champ Rudy Vido.

The matches were over quick‘
ly. Ethan Gi'ossman broke a los-
ing streak beating his opponent
5-0. Larry Mims followed with a
pin in 2:11 of the second period.
At this point the crowd was
aware that it shut out was a
possiblity.

Senior Jeff Albrecht wrestling
his last match in the SUNYA
gym won a superior decision
11-0. Jeff tried vainly to pin his
opponent but could not find the
right combination.

Tom Horn had the same prob-
lem. He dominated his match
but could not find the pinning

combination and had to settle
fora9-2 decision. '

Doug Bauer started off slow
and was actually behind until
the very end of the second
period when he barely beat the
buzzer with a takedown. But all
doubt was erased on who was
the better wrestler in the last
period, as Bauer mopped the
ring with his opponent. He ac‘
tually pinned him twice, the first
time on the fringe of the mat
and the referee ruled that they
were off it, the second time in
the middle of the mat in 6:14.

The most exciting match was
senior Jim Dickson's. Dickson
always comes out to give his all,
and he gave the crowd ii thrill.
He picked up his man a number
of times, slamming him to the
mat. Though he fell behind in
points early, his superior
strength enabled him to pin his
man with just five seconds left in
the match.

Frank Herman capped off the
shutout as be dominated the
second half of his match to win
a superior decision,

The Danes, now 7-3, travel to
Rochester this weekend for the
New York State Championships,
They end the season next ch>
nestlin at RPI.

J. V.

by Nathan Salzint

The Pups went to New Paltz
this past Wednesday, and may
never go back again, it is rare
that a team devastatcs another in
the J,V. Leagues, but this was
one of those exceptions, as the
Pups now 8-3 simply overt
whclmcd the opposition by a
score of 9268.

The game opened with the
Pups, led by Harold Merritt,
scoring the first i) points. The
lead quickly opened to 12
points, and Merritt sunk 1-1
points in the first -I minutes of
play. As New i’iilt'l. immediately
found out, he could scorc at
will, and would Icich the game
curly in the second half after
scoring a record 32 points.

With 8:22 left in the first half
the hapless New Piillv. fi found
out about another kcy I’up scor
ci', Josc Allct‘ll, who hit the first
of ll) straight points right then
and there. The lead quickly
widi-ncd to ill points. and the

game appeared to be as In the
bag as ever, and for once the
Pups kept it that way.

When Alicea went cold five
minutes later, Rich Kapner took
up the slack, hitting repeatedly
from the corners, iind ballooning
the lead to 28 points. When New
Paltz finally put 4 straight
baskets together, thanks to some
sloppy play by the Pup defense
the buzzer went off to end the
first half with the score 52-32.

The opening of the second half
sin the Pups put up a veritable
canyon between themselves and
the outclassed Ncw Paltzur's, as
the bulge reached 32 points.
Finally, it was time for the
rarely used Pup subs, who got in
somc valuable playing timc. for
most of the second half. Against
our second stringers, New Paltz
could do nothing, and ncctlloss
to say, the Pups won, 92-bit.

Coach Lewis was pleased, but
realistic, about. the will. “We
pulled the fast break off Very
well and opened it up early.
Kapncr had a great game in «Very

category, and Merritt scored at
will. However, New Pain. is not
one of the stronger teams we
play, so you have to put the
game into its proper [in
spectivc.” Agreed, but it‘snice to
beat a team you are supposed to
beat by a 34 point margin
Loosing back just one month
ago, the Pups were down in the
dumps with 1! 1-4 record no
offense, poor defense, and a
pessimistic future. Things chang»
ed rather rapidly, when the
Pups’ two key players joined the
team in January, Harold Merritt
and Rich Kapner. Suddenly, the
team was scoring, rebounding,
and most importantly, winning.

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21’), l‘l’ll’)

 

by Bill Heller

Byron Miller did a complete
turnabout in the 2nd half and
with the aid of a whole group of
hot Danes, led the way to an
87-54 romp over New Paltz.
Werner Kolln, Bob Rossi, Bob
Curtiss, and Dave Welchons t'lll
were on, as the Great Danes shot
53% from the field. The Hawks,
not as bad as everyone thought,
stayed with the Danes for 15
minutes and then entered Mr.
Rossi.

Playing one of his best games
of the year, Rossi came off the
bench to shoot 5 for 6 and blow
open the first half. The senior
guard was hitting the offensive
boards and making crisp passes
to compliment his hot hand.
With Welchons shooting 34,
Curtiss 4-6, and Kolln 5-8, one
can understand why the Danes
almost hit the. 90 mark.

Dunes Finally Win On Road 

The mainstay however, was
undoubtedly Byron. After a
horrendous first half of 3-9, 5
turnovers, and poor defense,
Byron did his thing. in the
second half, Miller banged in
7-12, finishing with 23 points
and 8 rebounds. it's a credit to
Byron to see him bounce back
the way he did. Perhaps it in

‘ dicates a sign of confidence and

maturity - i.e. the rounding out
of a superb ballplayer.

The game itself was never
really in question, Although the
Danes got off slowly, it was just
a matter of who would tun them
on. The answer was Rossi, and
he helped change a 22-20 game
into a 37-241 runaway at the half

A thirteen point lead isn‘t us
urilly a trcmcndous one, but
tonight it was. 'l‘hc Dani-s built
up a 5:135 spread and were
never hciidcd. llill'l‘y Johnson
and Dennis 'i‘crry cacli chipped
in six in llic last ten minutes to

make it a complete route.

The big question for the Danes
is post-season play. With the first
annual ECAC Tournament loom-
ing as a definite possiblity for
the 13-7 Danes, one thing is
clear, The next 3 games, all
home: Genesco (Friday night),
lthaca, and Williams, are definit-
ely important and will indeed
reVeal if the season for the Danes
is over, or very much alive. The
latest NYS sportswriters poll
shows Albany seventht With six
teams going to the NCAA's, the
chances for an ECAC bid are
good » if we win the rest of our
games, they are very good. Are
you going to come and find out
what happens, or just sit iind

Mermen End Streak

by Steve Katz

if on last Wednesday night you
were someplace on campus you
probably noticed a certain added
exuberance in the air. Perhaps
you jeard‘ cars honking their
horns or the sounds of truim»
pliant, joyous laughter. The
reason for all the intense jubila-
tion on an otherwise dreary wet
school night before midterms
was the fact that the Albany
State swim team had won its
first meet of the term defeating
New Paltz 55-47.

The victory Wits Iiot entirely
unexpected as the Ncw I’alt'l.
swimming team had a reputation
of medeocrity that prl-cccded
their appearance at the gym. The
New Paltz swimmers looked ripc
for the killing bringing a I tlllll ll
record to the meet. Albany
hopes for that long sought after
victory were enlivened by the
fact that New l’altz lliltl only
eight swimmers.
