Tire Board of Directors of the
Faculty Student Association put
off their final vote on a pro-
posed board increase Friday,
after student members argued
that they wanted to see the
proposal in writing before
casting their votes on the
measure.

The postponement was a vic-
tory for students. btrt probably a
short-lived one. The Directors
are expected to approve the 4%
across-the-boatd food hike when
they meet in special session
within two weeks.

The boost wrll add tip to $16
to the cost of a strident board
contract per year. increases in
cash food prices in the Campus
Center can also be expected
ortce the authorization is voted.

While the meeting was anti-cli-
mactic in its final outcome. it
did provrdc valuable insight irito
the student role within the
“non-profit" FSA corporation.

FSA Acting Director 13.
Norbert Zahm said the board
increase is necessary because of
rising food prices, extra feeding
days. an aritrctpated employee
pay increase, and a “number of
things that could happen."

Included aritoitg the latter cate-
gory are a drop in university
enrollment (which would rcstilt
in less income for the cttl'ptiluv
tron). an increase in the cost of
batik loans. and an increase in
direct operating expenses. Zahm
labeled these uncertain expenses
“management risks."

“You never know when some
body is gotiig to get caught in a

What seemed to get Lampert
most incensed was that part of
the proposal which granted
management the “authority” to
hike cash prices in the Campus
Center. but did not mandate the
action. Cash operations in the
cafeteria have continually lost
money while the quadrangles
have consistently turned a
profituwhich means not only are
resident students bailing out the
rest of FSA, they are bailirtg out
the rest of food service as well.

“i can‘t buy the proposal un-
less the prices are across-the--
board," he said, noting that it
penalized food service students
from “a food servrces point of
view."

The remark set off another
round of debate, with Balk
noting that “To mandate that

And so the arguments contin-
tied for well over an hour, until
the students insisted they receive
the actual proposals in writing
and be given time to appraise
their worth.

The differences between stu-
dent arid administrative mem-
bers of the FSA---differeitces
that have been noticeable for
four years now~--were best illus-
trated in the remarks of Dean
for Student Affairs, Neil Brown.

In explaining why he felt it
was not unfair to have students
build up a ﬁnancial buffer for
the corporation even though
they were receivtng no direct
benefits in return. he said.
"Students several years ago paid
for Camp Dipprkill and things
like that...there is a legacy each
of its has here in the
institution."

"But what one student asked
