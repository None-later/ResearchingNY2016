Less Dough for Politics, Athletics

By Mike McGuire

There are three types of lies.
said Mark Twain. regular lies.
damned lies. and statistics. And
it was statistics. Central Council
saw. when SA President Mike
Lampert told of the results of
the recent poll on use of the
student activities funds.

More university-wide concerts
are the top priority in how the
student tax is spent. according
to the results which Council
heard at their meeting Thursday
night. The poll had been held
with the mandatory tax referen-
dum. February l2-15,

The poll asked students
whether SA should spend much
more. somewhat more. the same.
somewhat less. or much less
money In each of fifteen areas.
For purposes of interpretation.
"much more“ was assigned a
value of l and “much less" was
assigned a value of 5. Then the
arithmetical average was found
for each question, If the average
voter wanted the status quo on a
particular question. the average
would be 3.00; if they wanted
more money it would be from
2.99 down to |.U()'. if they
wanted less money the range
would be 3.0I to 5.00. This type
of interpretation is referred to
technically as a- lakerl Ranking.

Concerts were most popular
with a schoolwide average of
l.81, Films followed with lift
and Performing Arts were third
with 3.34. Rounding out the top

half-dozen were speakers with
2.33; Newspapers and Radio
Stations with 2.34; and Fine
Arts with 2.44. Following those
were Recreational Groups with
2.45; All-University Weekends
with 2.47; Quad Programming
with 2.60; Academic Groups
with 2.81; and Intercollegiate
Athletics with 28]. Voters sug~
gested nearly the status quo for
the yearbook with a vote of
3.01.

On the “less money" side of

the vote were Magazrncs wrth
3.26; and (‘iiltriral and litlinic
Groups with .Uil. Political
Groups were least popular wrtlr
3.66. biit these groups are not
funded now and can't be due to
a regulation of the SUNY
Trustees relating to mandatory
activity fees.

Lampert. in the table of results
he gave out at the (‘ouncrl
meeting. broke down the aver-
ages by quads arid between those
who voted for voluntary tax and
those who voted for mandatory
tax. Voluntary and mandatory
voters differed substantially only
on three questions. Fine Arts
ranked 5th in priority for volun-
tary voters. but 8th for nianda»
tory. Newspapers and radio sta-
tions ranked 3rd among manda-
tory voters and oih among Vol
iintary voters, Recreational
groups ranked thi among volun-
tary and 51h among mandatory
tax supporters.

L'impert also computed the
standard deviation (a measure of
consensus) for each question.
The highest consensus was on
Yearbook, Films. and Perform»
irig Arts. the lowest was on
funding for Intercollegiate
Athletics. Political Groups. All-
-University weekends, and Cul-
tural and Ethnic Groups.

The Opinion Poll also asked
students whether they supported
use of SA funds for political
purposes. whether they sup-
portcd use of SA funds for
contributions to (‘oinniiimty
Servrce projects. and whether
they supported a orrc~tcrm e\‘-
penditure of 314.000 for WSlIA
to go l5M- Stereo instead of
FM'Mono. Voters turned down
political expenditures by a
7‘l’7rv-ZI'Z margin. They sup-
ported (‘onirnunity Scrvrce con-
tribiitioiis by a 7(l’.i-.l()'.i rnargiu.
and they voted for I‘M-Stereo by
a (i4%3(r"n margin.

There was little variance lit the
quad-by-quad vote. except in
two cases. Voluntary voters on
Dutch voted against FM-stereo
by a $671.44"! margin. while
FM—sterco won by only one vote
wrtlr Stale Quad mandatory
voters Also. Alumni Quad
(downtown) voted 3.08 on the
Quad Programming question.
wlirle the question got Jot)

by Kathy Eckerle

On Tuesday. February 5. Pros-
ident Benezet announced to the
University Senate that SUNYA
had finally been recommended
for affiliation by Phi Beta
Kappa. The announcement
marked the culmination of our
third attempt to join the exclus-
iVe scholastic honorary.

SUNYA's efforts to be part of
Phi Beta Kappa date back to
years when Albany was still a
teacher’s college. Our applica-
tion during the 1950’s was rejec-
ted and. though no official rea-
son was given for the action. the
insufficient siZc of the school
and the library were suspected
to be the cause.

In 1967. SUNYA again
applied. At that time. the univer~
sity was in a period of transi-
tion: President (.‘ollins had re-
signed. teachers were experi»
menting with courses and form»
ing new departments. and pass
fail for freshmen and sophrr

mores was soon to become a
reality. Ou'r bid for afﬁliation
was again rejected.

The Phi Beta Kappa Corri-
mr'ttee, headed by Mr. Dewitt
Ellinwood of the History De-
partment. petitioned Phi Bela
Kappa once more in 1970. This
time. the three—year process of
consideration ended our pursuit
for recognition. The Phi Beta
Kappa Senate recommended
thiit SUNYA be accepted.

Sigrium Laudis Threatened

With the formation of a Phi
Beta Kappa chapter on this cam-
pus, another scholastic honorary
will be overshadowed.

Signum Laudis, Albany‘s own
scholastic honorary. has recogr
nixed outstanding academic
achievement since June It. lilllt)
when the first group of students
were inducted by President Bru-
baclicr and Dean Metzler. Since
their, Signum Laudis has con
tinned to single out a select top

however. that may keep our

on Dec. 5. 1776 at. the College
of William and Mary. its purpoae
has been to “recognize and en-
courage scholarship. friendship
and cultural interests." The sel-
ection committee will look for
“broad cultural interesLs“ as well
as “scholarly achievements" in
its rippliCants,

this failure is that the teachers
