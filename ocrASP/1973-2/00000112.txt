SASU Conference Here

By Glenn von Nostitz

Over 100 delegates from carn-
puses around the SUNY system
met here last weekend, yester-
day, and today, for the second
annual SASU legislative confer-
ence.

SASU, the Student Association
of the State University, is spon-
soring the conference in an ef-
fort to provide a “healthy inter‘
change between the elected and
the electorate."

Numerous workshops have
been held or are Still scheduled,
ranging the gamut from an
analysis of the Budget Process,
and the Role of the Board of
Trustees. to Student Fees and
the Legislative Process. Also dis.
cussed was the SASU legislative
program, consisting of the
various bills and positions being
pushed by the state-wide student
organization.

The Saturday workshops coir-

HeaItLEetam;

ccntrated on aspects of inter-
University relations, and the
Monday worksltops featured ses-
sions with legislators here on the
Albany campus. Today is the
last day of the conference, and
on the agenda are appointments
with legislators at their offices in
the State Capitol Building.

On Sunday morning the dele-
gates were to have met with
SUNY Chancellor Ernest L.
Boyer for a breakfast workshop
at the Governor's Motor Inn, but
the Chancellor never showed up.
Boyer was slated to discuss the
“current state of the State Uni-
versity" and to informally an-
swer student questions, No rea»
sons were given for his absence.

On Sunday afternoon a special
membership meeting was held at
the Campus Center, during
which all new policy statements
by-law changes and resolutions
were debated.

Among some of the piovmrrm
being urged by the SASU leader

Regardless of what happens in
Vietnam in the coming months,
the U.S. may well be fighting its
next war in Thailand.

Already the US. is shifting
much of its military strength in
Indochina to Thailand, primarily
for continuing bombing attacks
on the Democratic Republic of
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia
but also, increasingly, with an
eye toward combatting liber-
ation forces in Thailand, too.

Currently, there are 50,000 U.
S. troops and ground personnel
in this country and here. also,
can be found the Seventh Air
Force, six U.S. airbases and the
headquarters of the Military
Air. 'nce Command, Southeast
Asia (MAC-SEA).

Meanwhile, in l.l‘t(' remote jun~
gli- and mountain areas of Thai-
land, guerrilla activity increased
during 1972.

operations were launched Dec.
11 last year at two troubled
areas on Phy Wae and Doi
Pachik of Nan province. A total
of seven Commanding officers
and 21 officers of the Cavalry
Division were killed and three of
its helicopters were downed by
ground-fire. The commander of
the Forward Cavalry Division
returned safely in a helicopter
crippled by guerrilla fire.

Thailand's “suppression opera-
tions" are counter-productive by
all accounts. Five years ago, the
Thai government attempted to
cut the guerrillas off from the
people by shifting the people to
new areas.

By removing and shifting
whole communities and popula-
tions from their old environs and
settling them in new areas, it was
believed that the guerrillas could
he deprivr-d of their base and the
sources of their supplies and
food, isolated and eventually
annihilated. This technique
I'ailcd against the Montagnards in
Vietnam. In Laos it only threw
up a new problem A of refugees
fleeing the new settlement.

But SICA'I‘O which has its
headquarters iir Bangkok and is
assisting the suppression opera
tions sets store by this It'(’l1‘
niquc, which is also the littsis of
tllt' “pacificntion” program in
Vietnam.

As it i‘csttll, the insurgency
problem, with which the ’I‘lrai
govr-rnnient is obsessed, has at"
tprii'crl a new dimension Irtll't't'tl
resettlement of |ll't)])lt‘ has con
t'l'l'tl such large areas tit llttI
traditional communist pockets

ii “fret-fire /.oni-" along thr-
'I'lttiiltitttllaius I)()I‘(It'l‘.'~i

A study of the resettlement
efforts has found that refugees
living in the new settlements
amount. to less than half the
population of the villages that
were forcibly evacuated. More
trihrrl people, the young men
cspccirilly, have guru.- frirthcr into
the mountains to avoid rest-uh»
merit

I)t'spitt' lavish aid by volunteer

groups and Thailand’s SEATO
allies, these centers of rehabilh
tation are poorly administered.
For instance, at Rong Sun, the
resettled people were promised
an irrigation dam long ago but it.
has not. nuterialiwd. The govern-
ment, not surprisingly, is unable
to get the cooperation of the
people for its having failed at
its own attempts to wipe out the
guerrillas, the Thai government
is already asking for more U.S.
support. Thai rulers are obsessed
with a “domino theory" of their
own, fearing a spread of libera-
tion forces from Laos and Cam-
bodia. Given guerrilla gains over
the last year, it is understandable
why they are so worried.

SOU’I‘HAMP'I‘ON, England AP
- Jason (Tardy was so sltt'prlst‘tl
the first time a traffic warden
threatened to givr' him it ticket
tliul Irv lrurst into tears. Jason Is
it years old.

The snappy rcd Italian sports
car llt‘ was driving was only a
batter operatr-d toy, with a top
spt‘t'tl of “.1 H1! miles per hour.
And Jason was only driving on
the sidewalk otitstilc the store
here whi-rt- his mother was Irtry
rrrg grocI-i'ics.

'I canw out of Illl' shop to find
.lrisrrn In tours with a traffic
warden standing chI' Irini,' his
mother. (‘yrrthta (Tardy, said
today. u'lht' Wrrrdi-n rirsistI-rl that
unless I carried the car home hi-
would issui- inc a ticket. At first
I thought he was joking, but he
assured mu Iii-wasn‘t.”

She nianngi-d to get homi-
carrying the car in one hand and
the groceries in the other, with
an unhappy small boy in tow.
Then she protested to policu.

PoliciI explained that tnift'rc warden
.lohrr [)alrymple was indeed
serious. It may havo been news
to “10 (tardy family, but to the
warden, the toy they gavc Jason

The toy, which cost about
tittitl, has two gears forward and
reverse. lint the driver has to
supply his own brakI-s by
pulling his foot rlowrreron the
ground.

A police spokesman said the
warden was concerned uonly
with the safety aspect for the
child drivrrrg such a Vehicle on
the road."

Iii-gally, the sidewalk is part of
the road. Mrs. (7ardy, however,
l't'llltlillt‘tl unctriiviiict-d that her
son's motoring Iralrits were a
dnttgcr either to himself or to
society ttl large.

“Jason tiftt'll accompanies inc

said. “We‘ve passed lots of police-

The committee to end my
toilets in America reports that it
is slowly making progress In its
efforts to wipe out pay toilets iii
the U.S. fort-var.

The group, which calls itself

‘CEPTIA', was formed in
Chicago under the leadership of
Steve Karganovic, a graduate stu
dent in International Relatior,
at tho University of Chicago.
Karganovic reports that Chicago
politicians are beginning to
introduce resolutions, which, if
adopted, will outlaw pay toilets
at airports and gas stations.

(.‘EI’TIA insists that pay toilets
are both inrmoral and unfair; the
group says that it's downright
degrading for someone to have
to come up with a dime--or even
a tprrrrtcr~- simply to use a toilet.
In addition, says CEPTIA, the
pay toilet is sexist; Krrrganovic
explains that women always
have to pay to use a toilet, while
urinals are free to men. CEPTIA
l'urthcr charges that the prry
toilet is controlled by a mono-
poly; Karganovic says that vir-
tually every coin-operated john
in the United States is now being
built by the Nik-OrLok Corpor‘
atiorr of Indianapolis.

(IEP’I‘IA has adopted an
insignia of a clenched fist,
holding a chain and padlock,
protruding from a toilet bowl.
The Chicago organization has
also iinnounded that it will soon
come out with its own news-
paper for members: It will be
called the “Free Toilet Paper",
