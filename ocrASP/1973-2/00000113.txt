PHILADELPHIA AP - The
American Dental Asstmiation has
challenged a report published in
its own journal about possible
danger of lead poisoning from
near-empty toothpaste tubes.

A group of Philadelphia
researchers report in the
February issue of the Journal of
the American Dental Association
that some children may be
getting dangerous amounts of
lead from their toothpaste tubes.

“Unfortunately, the article.

whether they represent brands
which haVc a major share of the
market. " an association spokes-
man told The Associated Press,

“As far as the associatinn has
been able to determine, all major
brands of toothpaste, which
represent approximately 90 per-
cent of the products sold today,
are presently packaged in either
plastic, aluminum or aluminum-

Prominent Conservative Criti-

Taking the Law Seriously

New York
Prominent conservativu William
1“. Buckley, Jr., who recently
called for repeal of the laws
governing marijuana, said in a
magazine article, released today,
that he did so because any law
that is largely ignored, as is the
marijuana law, weakens tbtI presv
tige of all laws.

Writing in the current issue of
Redbook magazine, Mr, Buckley
criticized the anti~pot advocates
saying, “The overwhelming ma
jority of those who are against
any reform in the present marir
