by Bill Brim 4

She ,billa herself as “The Divine
Miss M" and "the last of the
truly tacky ladies" in the same
breath; by whatever billing she
requests, she is simply fantastic.
Bette Midler is a devastatingly
funny comedienne, a beautiful
singer, and a totally engaging
presence. She stormed the stage
at teh RPI Fieldhouse last Fri-
day nite in an atmosphere
charged with hype and antici-
pation; two hours later even her
press clippings seemed pale.
Everything about her is totally
improbable and unbelievably in-

 

   
   

congruous; a voluptuous torso
bracketed by- very ordinary un-
derpinnings below and a kewpie-
-doll face topped with Raggedy-
-Ann orange curls on top, en-
cased in costumes that were
laughable in the Fifties. “Trash
with Flash" the lady calls it;
she's her own PR agent! The
program that she and manager-
/arranger/pianist Barry Manilow
have put together is camp,
sleazy, a barrel of fun. and very,
very touching.

Bette Midler could have played
it straight: her singing alone
would eventuall have cata-

pulted her to stardom. She tore
through an amazing range of
material: an old Bessie Smith
blues, a torch song (the lovely
“Am I Blue"), Broadway-show
material ("Friends"), and Fifties
rock and roll: “Do You Wanna
Dance,” “Do You Love Me,"
and the epitome of ultimate
trash: the Shangri-La’s “Leader
of the Pack." She tackled some
Forties material, too: the An-
drew Sister's “Hubba Hubba"
and “Boogie Woogie Bugle
Boy," and triumphed with every
piece. What makes Bette Midler
more than just a singer, though,
is the way she skewers the social
gamcsmanship and role—playing
that make this kind of "trash"
socially significant. Her sarcastic
explanation of “hubba-hubba"
(“in case you never knew, it
meant . . . hot shot") cxtcnds a
nostalgic romp into a sly poke at
hypocrises of past and present.
Bcttc docs for nostalgia and
for (amp what Commander
Cody does for country music: at
the same time that the genre is
lovingly resurrected, the culture
that produced it is withered by
what Miss M calls “quadruple
entendrc." The world of the
Andrews Sistcrs, or the world of
the styliZcII Fifties high school
of “Leader of the Park" is as
mythical as (,‘ody's “Kentucky
Hills of Tcniicsscc." As unreal as
both worlds are (and were),
they‘ve cxertcd a strong influ-
ence on the lchs of most. of us.
in this neck of the woods, Miss
M‘s nostalgia is, ofcourse, much
closer than the Commandch
(you have to have spent a couple
of years in the Midwest or the
South to really appreciate
Cody); it's New York nostalgia.
And even those of us who t‘till'
adier ourselves safcly past its
bIIIeful influence can't help but
laugh.

The Who, What, and Why of Rock Decadence

by Lynne Bronstein
Altemstive Features Service

This is the age of glamour
rock. Guys are putting on lip-
stick and eye shadow, adorning
themselves with sequins and jew-
els, even styling their hair.
They’re painting their fingernails
black and green. They're de-
claring themselves gay and
writing songs that more than
suggest homosexuality.

“This is the age of decadence.“
the critics declare. After all. the
green nailpolish fad was probabv
Iy inspired by the movie Cab-
aret. and everyone knows how
decadent Germany was in those
repressive times. One rock writer
rcccntiy pointed out that the
reason a guy like Lou Reed is
finally popular is that his kind of
music and lyrics are more at
home in a time of chicli dcca-
deuce than in the olddays of
[lower power.

Gcc, and i thought flowers
were also a symbol of “feminini-
ty." Feminiiiiiy. nothing‘ Don't
be fooled by this glamour trend
Underneath the frills and rougc.
there exists a liatrcd of wmiicn

audience have long since de-
fected to “women's music" for
entertainment. As women re-
think what popular music is all
about, Ilie results of this polar-
ization are beginning to show. in
the next few years we're going
to see an onslaught of female
musicians, some in groups, and
finally (i hope) an end to the
nonsensical concept of “male”
and "female" forms of music,
with male musicians jumping on
lhe bandwagon to copy the fe-
male musical .i'IyIc rather than
female artifich

Since l007 sonic Irreversible
"bonds" have lakcn place. not
the least of which is the yearning
by women to find a diffcrcnt

.inIi \Iilh them. many ollici
forms of [CpftESSIOII will have to

go. People are going to discover
the "feminine" and “masculine”
within all of us and stop shun-
ning or' persecuting the “f-
eminine.” To hope for this
change is to see the' present
“time of despair and decadence"
as not as bad as it seems. There
are ﬂowers amidst the garbage.

America in the 1970’s is an
ostrich sticking its head in a hold
to chase away the future. But
the ostrich doesn‘t know what it
fears and would be amazed to
discover that the future will only

serve to brighten its feathers.

So you guys out there with
your bright new plumage —
don‘t be afraid of yourselves
now that you’ve gone glam-
orous. Learn to loosen up and
regard people as individuals.
Learn a little about the sex
you've borrowed your new look
from and cease to taunt us.
Maybe in time you'll also notice
what we girls have known for a
long time 7 that it‘s hard to cry
and be real and human when
mascara runs in your eyes.

Donna Curry Perlorms

Music for Voice, Renaissance Lute, Baroque Lute and Classical
Guitar will be performed at 3:30 p.m. on February 27, 1973 by

lutenist-singer who convincingly presents a complete picture of the

rich repertoire -v

from 15th century to the 18th. and from Italy,

Spain, France, Germany and England. Her guitar arrangements
demonstrate the changes in style of later composers and players.

may point out how present'day instruments and techniques alter the
effects planned by the composer, who is almost always a player
~composer. All questions about the instruments, the literature. and

performance are welcome.
