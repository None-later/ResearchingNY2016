by Steven J. Kalz

The Great Dane Swim Team
should have been in really bad
shape as the team headed for its
nfeet at Oswego last Saturday.
After all, Oswego was another of
those small colleges that have
somehow got enough money and
talent together to establish
themselves as SUNYAC
swimming powers. The Oswego
team had a big college type
swimming pool and the team
itself was ranked as high as
number two in the SUNYAC by
some observers.

Instead, Albany was looking
forward to the meet. It was the
last meet of the season and the
meet had no real importance for
the SUNYA swimmers. At the
same time, New I’altz, which
had to be everybody's favorite
swim team after last week’s
Albany win, was there as well.

   

So Coach Kelly decided to ex-
periment. State distance swim-
mer Len Van Ryn found himself
entered in the backstroke event,
while backstroke star Marc Eson
was a Great Dane entry in the
100 yd. freestyle. Most State
swimmers were entered in events
they had-swam only in practice.

The meet itself saw Oswego
taking the meet while domin-
ating most of the competition.
Albany swimmers did their best
in their new, unfamiliar events,
however. Len Van Ryn ﬁnished
second in the 200 yd. back-
stroke event as did Marc Eson in
the 100 yd. freestyle. At the
same time, those Albany swim-
mers, swimming in their usual
events, put on quite a show. Jaik
Shubert, swimming in this last
regular season meet for Albany,
beat out a tough Oswego swim-
mer to finish first in the 200 yd.
Butterﬂy event. Later, Ken
Weber, who has been coming on

strong the second half of the
season, took first in the 500 yd.
freestyle, setting a personal
record time for himself with a
mark of 5142.1. Two of the
team's breastrokers, Les Puretz
and Rob Geir, made a strong
showing in the 200 yd. breast
strokeevent, finishing second to
the Oswego team.

Next week, the team will travel
to Geneseo for the three day
SUNYAC swim finals. It will be
interesting to see how well
Lennie Van Ryn and the other
State swimmers do against the
best swimmers in the state uni-
versity system. The meet also
signals the close of the collegiate
swimming careers of two of
Albany's finest athletes, Marc
Eson and Jail Shul)crt. Coach
Kelly will huvv a great deal of
difficulty finding replacements
for these two consistent winners
in the 200 yd. backstroke and
butterfly i-vvnts.

Albany Clips Geneseo; Miller leads Danes Over Ithaca

by Bill Heller

Yeah. Byron Miller. Mr. Byron
Miller. The graceful forward hit
just three field goals (10 points,
all in the second half) in Friday
night's win over Geneseo. He
was mad, so he took it out on
Ithaca the following night.

Combining his short jumper in
the lane with bombs from the
corner and floating drives, Byron
poured in a career high 32 points

 

against the Bombers. He shot H
for 23, hauled down 12 re-
bounds, and had 3 assists. He
was beautiful. The win was very
important for the Danes, who
raised their record to 15-7. They
now have an excellent chance
for an ECAC bid and still are
slightly alive for an NCAA berth
(basically because Potsdam was
upset by Cortland Friday night).
The Danes close their scheduled
season here, tomorrow night a-
gainst Williams. It'll be the last

regular season and possibly the
last home game (the ECAC’s
might be held at University
Gym, if the Danes make it)for
ﬁVe graduating Seniors: John
Quattrocohi, Bob Rossi, DaVe
Welchons, Bob Curtiss, and Wer-
ner Kolln.

On Friday night, the Danes
held off a stubborn Geneseo
squad 77-68. The game was over-
all sloppy, but Albany put to-
gether their defense and held the
visiting Blue Knights to 26
points in the second half. Six
men hit double ﬁgures for the
Great Danes: Troch (who rc-
injured his knee, but nonetheless
put in two good games this
weekend) was high with M, fol-
lowed by Reggie with 13, Wer-
ner Kolln and Bob Curtiss at 12,

and Bob Rossi and Byron with
10 apiece.

On Saturday, Ithaca invaded
University Gym. After a 30
point loss to RPI the night be-
fore, they found themselves in
the same position as the Danes:
Win. or giVe up all hopes for post
season play.

Falling behind 38-26 at inter-
mission and 66-50 in the second
half, the Bombers staged a great
rally, only to fall short at the
hands of Byron. Miller swished 3
big buckets in the stretch and
also had a key rebound and
assist to finish the opposition.
Bob Curtiss contributed a strong
game with 12 rebounds and 8
points. Werner and Reggie both
had 12, Troch added 10, and
Rossi clicked for 8 for the Great
Danes.

“Oh, the fans are great when
the team is on

It's our team now - we‘re No.
1!

But if they lose a game or two

Forget about them and give
cm the screw.’

Tomorrow the Danes close
their regular season against
Williams. If there isn't a packed
house - it'll really be a shame.
Especially with a bid in the
balance and maybe bye-bye for
ﬁve Great Danes. Let‘s get with
it. Fans.

 

 

Congratulations
The ASP Sports staff extends its congratulations to

the five graduating seniors on the Dane Basketball

team. Thanks Troch, Bob, Dave, Bob and Werner.

 

 

Union

The Albany State Great Dane

The game was as good as over,
and the few fans in attendance

lack of free throws, and Steve
Kelly‘s 2] points, were consider-
able factors in the Pups down-
fall.

In sum, it was a repeat of the
teams' first miitchup. Albany
just could not handle Union's
two big men, could not pull
down any offensive rebounds,
and simply dropped dead for
tlmse key seven minutes in the
second half.

At least the J.V. team is guar»
iintced u .500 season, their
record now 9-8, with this Wed-
nesday's mutchup with Williams
prior to the varsity contest.

On a side note, the annual
Alhuny Alumni Game was won
hiindily by the Yellow team, led
by Dan Zeh's 24 points, and 15
apiece for Adiim Reeds and Jim
Sandy. The Purple team, center-
ing around all time Dune scoring
lender Rich Miirgison and Mike
Adams, was ulieiid for must of
the first half, but was totally
outclassed in the second half by
the much younger Yellow five.
