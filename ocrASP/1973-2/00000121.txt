Berkeley. Calif./AFS--Barely
before the 'polls closed last
November 7. the pundits who‘d
awakened America to an apoca-
lyptic vision ot‘a united. vindic-
tive “Youth Vote“ were choking
on their rakisli new Woodstock
slouch hats.

Like newly enfranchised
women ﬁve decades earlier. the
pesky first-time voters had
proved too orriery (or simply
too many) to fit in anyone‘s back
pocket. and most professional
observers consigned the “Youth
Vote" to the garbage-bin of poli-
tical science textbooks.

Overlooked in their rush to
greener statistical fields was the
fast-growing iniprrct of the stu-
dent vote in

“Minimum. as an identiﬁable
voting bloc, often determining
the choice of city council mem-
bers and the course of local
referenda.

Nowhere is their inﬂuence felt
more strongly than in Berkeley.
The scene of almost constant
campus upheavals since I964,
this polyglot Northern
California community began to
feel the students‘ impact at the
polls only in I970. In that year,
incensed by the US. invasion of
Cambodia, University of
California students provided the
organization arid the votes for
Ronald V. Dcllums, a radical
Black anti-war spokesman on the

City Council, to upset air err-

trenched liberal Congressman.

Following up the November

l‘)70 election of Dellums to the
Congress and of a young liberal
to tltc State Assembly, students
again provided the margin In
April 197] for a liberal Black
Mayor and three radical (‘in
(‘ouncil candidates.

Unlike nearby Davis, site of
another campus of the Univer-
sity of California - where stu-
dents coristituc 45 percent of
the people, and last year elected
a liberal majority of the Davis
because they lack an awareness city council - fewer than a
qttartcr of Bcrkclcy's 120,000
people are students. But III the
April 1071 city clcclltitisua year

Iiito cl’l'cctA-studcnt

local elections
where state law and sometimes
capricious local officials permit
students to register at their
college residences. Four million
college students rniglrl have no
palpable effect on a one-sided
Presidential election in which at
best they would constitute six or
seven percent of the vote, but in
college towns the large propor-
tion of residents who are Slll-

votes went preponderantly to
the candidates of the radical
April Coalition: with more than
thirty City Council candidates in
the race, students gave a clear
majority to each of the four
Coalition nominees, and more
than 60 percent oftheir votes to
the liberal of the two mayoral
candidates (who won by a
plurality of just 56 votes in the
city at large.)

Similarly, Berkeley‘s students
contributed heavily to the narA
row (52.5 percent) victory of a
radical rent control measure here
last June and to the over-
whelming majorities III the I072
general elections for Rep.
Dellurns arid Scn. Mctiovcrn (73

Capitol Jobs Offer Various Opportunities

by Audrey Seidman

Jay Goldman, a SUNYA sen-
ior, said he is “very interested in
politics.” That is why he is
working as a legislative aide in
the New York Senate.

Jay is one of the many stu-
dents herc who ltavc found jobs
at the State Capitol, not five
miles from campus, for the pres-
ent legislative session. Their rea-
sons for applying for legislative
jobs range from a desire for
governmental experience to a
need for money rind/or grad-
uation credit.

lay got his job through one
academic channel. the chis
lalivc lrrtcrrislnp class. taught by
Roy A. Spcckhard, Associalc
Dean of l’oltttcal Sctcricc. Speck-
liard described the course as
"much like an Independent stu-
dy tn the legislative process."

‘His main duties are to answer
constituency letters and write ex-

search paper on the process of
passing a bill.

One interesting experience he
has had so far was when he had
to handle a roomful of trial-
-lawyers lobbying against the
no‘fault insurance plan. He en-
joys his work, and feels that “by
working down here you actually
have an input."

Another way to get academic
credit for working at the Capitol
is through the Community Servi-
