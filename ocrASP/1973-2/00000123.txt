A New ASP Feature

 

 

 

For as long as arty of us. even the most ancient, can remember, our
university has been "in transition]. “changing. on the way.“ The
rate and pressures and oscillations of change continue unremittineg
to intensify. and in the turmoil the purpose. the character. the phi-
losophy of our institution have come to seem to some uncertain:
challengineg uncertain. disconcertineg. or even demoraliungly un-
certain.

It is possible that our university intends to build on the traditions
of cullegi'um. that is. a community of students, those now in the role
of teachers (Irwgisrri) and those now in the role of students (scho-
lari): the bastc Idea of collegiuni is Iliat everyone in the community
is a student. This posstbility can be nourished hydialogue among the
members of the "college." that is students and faculty and their
representatives we call administrators.

ASP reﬂects siudcnt concern and tlllt‘llc‘t‘luul ulcdltullilll to this
idea. Special encouragement should be given. however. to the lacitlt)
to speak in dialog about where we are headed in our “transition " Br
dialog we mean soiiicilnng less mechanical than whatever Is suggest-
ed by the current phrase, "input into the decision-making piotess ”
It has been decided to reserve a page III the ASI’ ever} Tuesday to

Coalition to Retain Discount Fares

Washington, DC. (CPS)--An in-
tensive lobbying effort seeking
Congressional authorization for
the continuation of youth fares
on domestic airlines is apparent-
ly paying off.

A recent Civil Aeronautics
Board (CAB) decision threat-
ened the discount plan with ex-
tinction. Congress is considering
legislation to override the CAB
ruling.

Last week, Representative
Harley Staggers (D.-W. Va.),
chairperson of the House Inter-
state and Foreign Commerce
Committee, introduced a hill to
reinstate the air travel discounts,
Any legislation on youth fares
would have had to clear Stag-
gers’ committee before reaching
the floor of the House for de-
bate.

“It‘s a really good sign thatth
chairman of this committee is so
obviously in favor of youth dis-
counts," said Rob Simmons of
the Coalition to Retain Air Dis-
count Fares (CRADF). “Wu only
wanted him to introduci-
another person's resolution on
the floor," he said.

There are already two other
bills in Congress concerning
youth discount fares, both favor-
able. Representative William
Keating (IL-Ohio) and Senator
Frank Moss (D.-Utah) intro-
duced youth fare legislation in
the House and Senate earlier this
your.

The lobbying campaign is be-
ing coordinath by CRADF, a
group that shares office space
with tho National Student
Lobby (NSL). CRADF has gain~
l'tl the support of a number of
otlwr student organizations.

The new li-gislation includes
special fart: authorization for
“Individuals who are 2] years of
age or younger, or lib yl’ttrta' of
age or older," in the words of
the Moss proposal. The inclusion
of the senior citizvn clause had
garnered additional supporters
for the lobbying effort, includ-
ing tlw American Association of
Retired Pirrsons and the National
Assoctation of Retired Federal
Employees.

Htudi‘iits at West. Virginia Univ
I-rsity look .i spi-rinl Iiilorirsl Ill
lIH‘ itl'fiirl store a key to thi-

struggle lay in the hands of a
fellow West Virginian, Represen-
tative Staggers. The Congress-
man's ofﬁce was deluged with
letters and telegrams of support.
The student newspaper, The
Daily Athenaem, took a strong
editorial stand in support of
youth fares, and along with the
student government helped or-
ganize the campus for the cam-
paign. The student response was
instrumental in Staggers’s deci-
sion to introduce youth fare
legislation, claims the National
Student Lobby.

NSL and CRADF have con-
tacted a large number of con-
gresspeople in their lobbying
effort and are guardedly op-
timistic about the chance for
passage of the legislation. The
Moss hill cleared the Senate last
session. but ti House Version died
during debiitc over the sky-
jacking bill to which it was
atlachcd.

Although thtl reaction in Con»
gri-ss s'i-cms favorable, CRADF
(loordinnlor Steve Russell warns
the fight is not ovar yet. “There
are some procedural problems
and some strong lobbies agninst
the discounts." he said. One of
these lobbies is the Trailways
bus lineI whose suit four years
ago prompted the CAB review of
airline rates and discounts.

In the December 7 CAB ruling,
the panel held that youth fares
wcrc unjustly discriminatory,
The majority of the CAB mem-
hens felt that the discounts had
outlivud their usefulness as a lure
'.o new air travelers, and simply
had become underpricnd seats.

CRADF argues that airlinw do
benefit economically from the
lower fares, “because they take
care of empty seats which cost
relatively little to ﬁll." The
lobby feels the heart of the
dispute. is the lumping together
of standby fares and discounts
on guaranteed reservations.
CRADF would eliminate the
guaranteed reservation discount
as oni- step toward revising Iiir
fan's. They point out the orig-
inal concept of standby dis
counts was justified by the CAB
itsclf. ’l‘hc CAB had encouraged
youth fares in the mid-60's on
till“ grounds that young people
