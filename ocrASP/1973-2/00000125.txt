Why Women's Liberation?

By Patti Masliiioff

A father and son were in an
auto wreck. The father was kill-
ed and the son was rushed to a
hospital for emergency surgery.
The attending surgeon looked at
the boy and said, “I can't oper-
ate, that's my son."

the Mother's a surgeon. he’s a
cbauvinist.

women also "failed." Women's

FRIDAY, MARCH 1%, 103/.

The twelve-year-old now goes
to Junior High School where the
girl takes Home Economics and
the boy takes shop. It is the rare
case where the reverse is true.
High School continues this for-
mation of the sex role: girls are
trained to be secretaries and
boys to be auto mechanics. Even
the college bound students are
pressured into sex roles. Think
about it-think carefully for it is
not so obvious for the student
who intends to continue school,
How many parents encourage
their daughters to be teachers?
Why‘.’ Because it is a good job
for a girl. She can thkt‘ off whcn
she is vacations are
convenient for caring for the

theless towards the goal of role
liberation.

Fifty years ago, women were
granted to right to vote. At this
time, it was a debatable issue.
Were women capable of voting?
Today, it would be considered
absurd to take away the
women's Vote. How much of our
sex roles today are accepted as
unconciously and falsely as was
the role of women 50 years ago
in the political system'.’ Fifty
years from today, or perhaps
even five years, we will look at
our scx roles today and wonder-
in the same way that we are
amach now that the women’s
vote was a result of radical strug-
glc.

Young View of Washington

The Generol's Baby Sitters

WASHINGTON-4t. took along
time, but Congress ﬁnally is
about to take a close look at the
traditional but wholly-
unauthorized military practice
of providing enlisted "servants"
for generals and admirals.

A General Accounting Office
study requested by Senator Will-
iam Proxmire (D-Wisc.) recently
disclosed that there are 1,722
soldiers ofﬁcially designated as
personal aides to generals and
admirals. The cost to the Ameri-
can taxpayer is in excess of $13
million every year just for the
pay and allowances of these
men.

These enlisted personnel are
assigned to 860 of the military's
more than 1,300 general and flag
rank officers, usually on the
basis of rank (one aide per star),
Proxmire, with the highest
ranking military officers having
as many as eight, or two per star.

According to the GAO report,
tlic allocation of aidcs has alarm-
ing racial ovcrtones. For ex
ample, some 98 per cent of aides
in the Navy arc li‘ilipinos. In the
Marine Corps, (in pcr cent are
black.

Mort-over, promotions
far more slowly for aides than
for other unlisted pcrsoiincl 'l'ht-
aVi-ragt- Navy man at tlic rank of
E ti rcccivcs a promotion in nine
years, while a Navy little at the
samc rank is likcly to stay there
for IR ycars.

lint most slim-king of all are thc
ill-meaning chores routinely as

generals' private cars and those

dening; cooking meals for mem-
bers of the family, even when
the commanding officer is not
there; running errands for gen-
erals' wives; babysitting; dog-
walking; cleaning swimming
pools. The list goes on.

Thcsc duties are not author—
ized either under law or written
military procedures;| nonetheless,
through a combination of long»
standing tradition and the fear
of reprisals, aides have felt com-
pelled to do the bidding of their
masters, no matter how de-
meaning the task.

Already Proxmire has received
letters from aides, their families
and friends which underscore
the GAO conclusion. One aide
told of having to make the beds
of his commander‘s lazy child-
ri-n, and being required to servo
the family dinner on Christmas
Day while other soldiers were at
home with their own wives and
children.

l’riixmirc has introduced legis-
lation specifically forbidding the
practice of turning aides into
personal aiitl family servants. His
proposal is likely to have strong
support among Republicans and
[)cmocra ' alike in both Houses
