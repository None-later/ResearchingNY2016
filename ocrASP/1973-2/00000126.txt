Welfare Myths Explored

By Elinor Houldwn

The subtitle is We Ain't Gonna
Shufﬂe No More. The mothers
who speak out are leaders of the
black, white, red and brown

ghottos of Milwaukee. They
speak for the poor all over
America.

They are backed up by solid
editorial research. This book
shows that almost everyone in
this nation is on welfare, though
for the rich it's called “farm
subsidies," “defense contracts."
“guaranteed loans," “oil deple-
tion allowances,” or “tux-free
capital gains."

The US. gives $60 to $70
billion a year in assistance to
business and the rich. A favorite
example: over 300 people made
more than $200,000 in ‘69 and
paid no federal income tax at all;
among them, 56 persons earned
a million, tax-free. "A tip of our
hrit goes to Ronald Reagan," say
the editors, “a millionaire who,
in 1970, had a house provider]
by the suite, drew over $111,000
in salary, but still paid no state
income tax at rill.”

A chapter on “Poverty Pimps"
li‘lls how billions of War on
Poverty dollars never reach the
poor at all. “We feel we're just
urban prostitutes," one mother
says. “Anybody can draw tip it
proposal and present it to HEW
(or) the CEO people and say
they are going to do something
for the poor, and make a lot. of
money off us.“

“Welfare Mythology" deals
with society's fantasies. Welfare
lakes most of your taxes, they
cry. A factual comparison shows
the cost of welfare was under
$15 billion in 1070t-hu1f of this
was federal money-while war
[are costs for fiscal '71 were
$73.0 billion-over a third of lhe
federal budget!

“Ask the ASP”

1)t-rir Ask the Asp,

Why is it that people gel tired
on 3 hour car trips? I told my
suitemates that it’s because the
mind and body must exert ener~
gy to keep one's physical and
mental state in momentum with
the car at 65 mph, They laughed
at me. What do you think?

Dear Ask the Asp,

Whenever I go home for vaca-
lion, my parents expect me to
spend almost all of my time with
them, We always end up having
arguments because they think I
spend too much time away from
home With my friends and not
enough time with them. I think
that I divide my time in such a
way as to please my parents and
myself. 1 really hate to fight
with my parents but 1 do think
that they are being unreason-
able. What should I do?

M.F.

Ucur M I" .

H:in a talk with your parents
and explain to them your point
of Vll‘W. Tell them that although
they mean a lot to you, your
friends mean ll lot to you too,
lintl rightfully M). Perhaps if, ill.
the beginning of each VliL’illlUl],
you discuss with your parents
which days you're planning to
spend with them, they‘ll rcaliLe
that you are not abandoning
llH‘l‘I] for your friends, which is
what they might be fearing. A
little reassurance is probably all
that they need.

Another myth: Put them to
work to solve the problem. A
percentage breakdown shows a
fourth sre senior citizens and
half are children. Then there are
the incapacitated, the perma-
nently disabled, the blind. About
eight-tenths of one percent are
fathers looking for work. This
leaves 13 percent-mothers, one
fifth of whom are already em-
ployed or in job-training, the
others with small children at
home. New York City's “Get
Tough Policy” revealed only
296% of those on old were em-
ployable in the current econom-
ic structure.

Now the myth about welfare
cheaters. These 7 in a thousand
are certainly publicizad. But
little is said about the real
frauds--the states with their ille-
gal “residence requirements"
and “waiting lists" and the cipher
game they play. manipulating
federal standards. Maryland's
“standard of payment" is only
65% of need, and Mississippi‘s

their profits from the book to
welfare rights organizations, and
asking people who can afford
the books to put. them in the
hands of people or groups who
cannot. This book is important.
It. will clue you in on facts. It
will tune you in to the voices of
the poor:

"This country spends $6500
for 3 seconds of war," says one
of them, “and then talks about
$2400 for a family of four fore
year. Now what kind of sense
does that make?"
