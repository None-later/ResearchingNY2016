“outsider” status, was our close prox

l Greek Students Come Alive-

University students throughout the United States and western Europe are
now more “passive” than at any time since the 1950’s. Although the
conditions which gave rise to the great upheavals oftlie last decade remain
essentially unchanged, the student movement remains uninvolved and
disinterested.

This is not the way it is in Greece. Greek students, for years the most
passive in tlic Wt’ht’ttl’c now beginning to protest the police-state tactics and
brutality of the ruling military junta.

Wliilc Atllt‘l'ltilll students five years ago were activc. the Greek students
were subdued. .iiid were often looked ttpoti as :niaclironisms iii a decade of

turlin lance.

'l'lic silictlulc for the balance oi the semester appears uncncouraging.
Actording to the Student Association Political Coordinator. there is a
“possibility” that Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate. may appear. But
that's about it.
