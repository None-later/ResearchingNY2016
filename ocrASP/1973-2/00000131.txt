by Kenneth Arduino

The Albany State wrestling
team ended up a successful sea-
son Wednesday night as they
beat RPI 40-11. It was a success-
ful end to the 8-3 season. It also
took some of the sting out of
last weekend‘s eighth place
ﬁnish in the New York State
Championships.

Last weekend everything look-
ed pretty good. Albany was in
third place after the semiﬁnal
round, Rudy Vido and Larry
Mims were in the finals. and
both had a good chance to win.
But the roof fell in. Mims was
decisioned by a wrestler he beat
in the SUNY Championships,
Vido was beaten by Benedict of
Union. the only wrestler to have
beaten him all year.

But Albany might have held on
with some points in the consol-
ation rounds yet only Jeff
Albrecht who finished sixth
could get points and Albany
dropped down to eighth An

weekend for the NCAA College

Jeff Albrecht closed out a fab-
ulous career with the Great
Danes by winning in 3:49 via
default. Too bad his career end-
ed on that note and not a pin.
Tom Horm faced one of the top
wrestlers in the area and lost via

‘ a decision.

Bruce Cummings wrestled 167
and did something no Albany
wrestler has done all year; pin an
opponent in 30 seconds. It was
the fastest pin of the year by an
Albany wrestler.

Senior Jim Dickson was unable
to go out a winner as Iic never
really got started, and was easily
beaten. Frank Herman won via a
forfeit and then Rudy Vido add-
ed another victim to his list.

Except for Mims and Vido the
season is over for Ilie wrestlers.
Much improvement is evident
from last year‘s 5-5-l team, It
was a good season.

built a five point lead. Troch
proceeded to get really hot and
scored four buckets in three and
a half minutes to open up a
65-55 bulge. At the 7:00 mark, a

Harry Johnson jumper made it
71-59 but it was all downhill
front there.

Dick Small scored ten to pace
at Williams comeback. He hit a
jumper to make it 73-65, a foul
shot put it at 77-72, successivo
baskets cut the Great danc lead
to 79-74. 79-76. arid til-78. The
time left was 57 seconds and
everyone was shaky.

_ ruin the ECAC bid and make it
Troch's last game. The three
years of playing for the Danes
meant nothing now. The 17
points and 6 assists he had ac-
cumulated in the game also were
meaningless. It was all on the
foul line.

The “best man in the world to
shoot foul shots (as Doc Sauers
put it)" had personal thoughts as
he walked to the line. “I was
thinking ifl missed we wouldn’t
get a bid.“ As the Danes walked
off the court, the fans were
stomping and John Quattrocchi
was smiling. Tough. It has been
an up and down season for
Troch. Tonight was up. He will
be one hard man to replace next
year.

 

 

There will be a meeting for all
persons interested in trying out
for the men's varsity and junior
variety tennis teams Tuesday
March 6 at 4:15 pm. in Room
125 of the Physical Edueation
Building.
