Seance animosity

“The subject l'm speaking
about today is the relationship
between Scott Fitzgerald and
the world of the twenties. it‘s a
two-way relationship let its never
forget-- how much did the
twenties have to do with
Fitzgerald's being what he is.
how much of our image of the
twenties depends on what Fit?»
gerald said about it.”

So began Arthur Mizener,
author oft The Far Side of
Paradise, and'iproniinent specialist on
F. Scott Fitzgerald. For those
who missed the lecture, and
more thaii that, the reception
afterwards. it‘s truly a pity.

At 1:00, L. C. 3, usually only
half full for total attendance of
the American Studies class, was
overcrowded Friday. when other
interested students and factilty
filled the audience to listen to
Professor MIZL‘HL’I, guest speaker
for American Studies. He spoke
for fifty minutes on Fitzgerald
as a literary historian of the
period oftlrc l‘tZU's.

“i would like to suggest to
you,’ Prof. Mireiier explained.

campus exchange:

by Mark Litcofsky

Students at .S‘UNY u/ .S'Ionr'
Brook litrve demanded of their
administrators the initiation of
extensive safety precautions on
campus. This action is the rcstrlt
of the accrderrlal death of an
til-year old freshman who fell
35 feet through an uncovered
manhole. it had been deter-
mined that "inhaling steam and
getting scalded" was the cause nt
liis death. The students also de-
mand the fixing of Wiring and
lighting, faulty roads, and the

 

 

twenties lived by an ethos that
was genuinely and seriously
trying to be at once worldly and
intelligent, fashionable (if that
isn‘t a derogatory term), up with
their society...and yet thought-
ful. seriously but not solemnly
alive. This was the world that
Fitzgerald had a very acute
imaginative sense of.”

His speech went on to define
Fitzgerald's works more clearly.
He (Fitzgerald) wanted to main-
tain the link between literature
and the common man. The
common reader complained that
the writers were too obscure, the
writers complained that the
readers were too stupid. Fitz-
gerald (and some of his contem-
poraries) tried to bridge the gap.

“Oneol the wonderful things
about Fitzgerald‘s imagination is
integrity. liowevcr, looking back
at it you could say. well we were
a bunch of fools. He never hesi-
tated to say we riiiisl remember
how we felt when we were
there-- we had a great time,"

What Dr Mixener tried to
point otit again arid again, was

such as the allocation of
