Mangione Plays Colioes

The Chuck Mangione Quartet, a jazz ensemble from Rochester,
will be heard: in concert March 9 in the Cohoes High School
Auditorium. The concert which will begin at 8 pm, will be for the
beneﬁt of the Cohoes Community Center.

The Chuck Mangone Quartet features the leader on piano and
flugelhorn, and Gerry Niewood on a variety of \woodwind instru-
ments. Slim Johnson on bass and Joe Labarone on drums are the
remaining members of the group.

Chuck Wane has become well-known to locale fans within the
past year thfough- several concerts in the area. Last' summer, the
Rochester musician performed the opening concert at the Saratoga
Performing Arts Center. The performance featured Mangione‘s
arrangements, performed by a full symphonic orchestra from
Rochester, with Mangione conducting.

Since then, the quartet has appeared in concerts at RPI College and
at the Rowntowner Motel and Restaurant in Colonic.

Chuck Mangione and his brother, Gap, who plays the keyboard
instruments, began playingjazz in their early teens around Rochester
when they sat in with visiting “name” musicians such as Art Blakey,
Oscar Peterson and Max Roach. When Dizzy Gillespie heard Chuck

.play he was so impressed he presented him with one of his famous
“up-do" trumpets. Mangione later turned to the ﬂugelhorn which he
felt was better suited to his style of playing.

In I960, the Mangione brothers received acclaim in an appearnace
at the Randall’s Island Jazz Festival in New York City and shortly
thereafter recorded their first album, “The Jazz Brothers," a
Cannonball Adderley production. Chuck Mangione then went on the
road with the Jazz Messengers of Art Blakey. After a stint on the
road he studied music at the Eastman School of Music in his home
citv and later became a member of the facultv.

Cohoes Community Center.

E.S.P. Machine: Magic is Fact

by Saul-Paul Sirag
Alternative Features Service

When the first Apollo astro-
nauts went to the moon in 196‘)
they were tracked by NASA's
sophisticated complex of talents»
etry in Houston, Texas. Also
following their progress, from
Florida, was one T. Galen Hiero-
nymus using a small gadget he
had invented in the fifties. He
wrote a 32-page report describ-
ing physical changes in the astro-
nauts frotti lift-off to splash
down and through their quaran-
tine period.

According to Joseph Gooda-
vage. writing in Analog, Decent-
ber 1972. l-Iicronymus's “vitality
intensity values“ for the Apollo
15 astronauts correlated closely
with the findings of the medical
telemetry system used by
NASA's chief ﬂight surgeon.
Brit, concludes Goodavage, “for
finely detailed, in-depth draina-
tic impact, the Hieronymus nia-
chtne seems to have a clear
advantage over the most sophis-
ticated communications system
in the arsenal of space technolo-
to"

The Hieronymus gadget is a
psionics machine, a devtce that
amplifies pt’f power, that is,
extra-sensory perception. Several
such devrccs are currently beirig
researched and developed It] the
Sovrct Union (sec Psychic l)is-
covcrics Iicliind the Iron (‘ur»
turn. by ()strtiridcr and Schroe-
dcr. Prentice Ilall. 1970.) Bell

Telephone and ITT are quietly
researching psiottics.

The Hieronymus machine cori-
sists of a scanning tray attached
to a flat copper coil sandwiched
between two quarter-inch thick
sheets of plastic. The coil is also
attached through an electrical
circuit to a verriicr dial. To
detect , say 7.1!“: in a rock sample.
you place the sample 7 or a
picture of rt in the scanning
tray. Then. with one hand
touching the plastic surface of
the machine. the other turning
the verriier dial,yotr concentrate
mentally on the zinc.

Eventually you will find a set-
ting that associates with a panic
ular feeling of the haiid on the
plastic for example, a furry
feeling. If the feeling is strong,
presumably there is a fair quanti-
ty of zinc in the sample. Others
may find Zinc associated With
the same scltirig though not
necessarily with the same feel-
ing. The machine apparently,
amplifies your natural psychic
ability to detect zinc.

However, when Analogs edi-
tor, John Campbell, investigated
llieronyirius's machine iii the fif-
ties, he found, quite by accidcnt,
that the machine worked just as
well Without its power source

into lhc Wild-blue yoridcr: be

Actually physics has not been

more pattern we see and the less

When the Altman Brothers
Band drifted on stage last Satur-
dny nite (shortly before 9 pm.)
the weeks of hassling and confu-
sion that preceded the show, the
bomb threat that many of Us
knew had to be coming. and
Albany’s long, long rock and roll
drought fused with the growing
legend of the Allman Brothers
Band to create a fever pitch of
excitement and anticipation that
this area hasn’t seen in ages.
