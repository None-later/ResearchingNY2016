Miles Davis and Maynard Fer
guson are-two trumpet player-
who have been able to stun the
tide of faddilln and change to
the point where they have al-
ways been able to sell, enough
records and draw well enoudi at
concerts to keep themselves in
the money. They have done this
by “keeping up with the times"

 

and they are still doing just that.

but in different ways.

Davis has gone the hard rock
line, and it bu paid off com-
mercially so well that he is prob-
ably the biggest money maker in
jazz. Asthetically, he has suf-
fered horribly. His solos are now
little more than a repitition of
schreeehes and staccato monot-
ony that make each of his
albums and the cuts within each
album, virtually indistinguish-
able from each other.

Such is very much the came in
Miles' new album, 0!! the Corner
(Columbia KC 31906). He has
behind him one of the stiffest,
and unimaginitive rhythm sec-
tions ever to disgrace a jazz
group. The personnel is not
listed, but. it appears that Carlos
Garnett is one of the reed men,

Davis & Rat

and '- the only plays whoqu-
topt into the mimic, and even
then it's on a‘vay superﬁcial
lewd. Cdulnbia hi probably
foueen the ineritaﬂe public
buedorn with uni- nouaenle. and
hshiedtospikethereeordupa
little with some electronic gim-
micha (echo, dlannd switching,
etc.)

Jazz people are beginning to
ignore Miles. and rock critics are
only praising him because al-
thouﬂi they don't understand
the music they are intimidated
by Mr. Davis' reputation. If he
doesn't straighten up soon, this
jazz titan migit fade away into
the sunset.

Ferguson has taken another
route to the bank. His most
recent recording-M1". Ilom
Two (Columbia KC 31709)~
makes use of the popularity of
some hit songs (Spinning Wheel,
Start, etc.) and has stretched big
band arrangements around them.
There are some ex huberant solo-
ists (his whole band is from
England), and some amusing
charts, but I miss the daring
excitement of Maynard’s Color
Ilim Wild days. Ferguson freaks,
and big band fanatics may like

Sinking of big hands, I re-

Poseidon

By Joseph Dougherty

There is a strange fascination
for the “Big Picture," the epic.
It's a little like going to Niagra
Falls; you wonder how some-
thing so big can possibly work.
Unlike the falls, most “Big l’ic-
tures" don't work.

Irwin Allen is perhaps best
known to you as the producer of
the Losl in Space and Voyage to
Ihc Bottom of Ithcu television
series. He has never been accused
of going over anyonc’s head and
he is the producer of The Porci-
don Adventure. Mr. Allen, in his
own Iilllc way, has come up
with a rather cute “Big Picture."

Before going any further let
me make [be following clear:
Poseidon is pure escapist lilm. It
is rtol fair to judge it as a scrious
work; it's too big to hc a work
of ail. If P().\'t‘f(l(lll is a work of
art then so is the Hoover Dam.
Those of you who wish to dc—
l'cnd the artistic merit of the
Hoover Dam may contact me
privately.

Eighth Step

Eighth Step Coffee House, 14
Willett Street, Albany, will pre-
sent the folk trio of Chris, Tony
and Tony, in a program of origi-
nal country music and contem-
porary folk music.

Prior to their present arrange-
ment, two members of the
group, Chris and one of the
Tony's, were members of a
group known as Brother’s,
Lover's, and Friends. As such
they played many of the coffee
houses in this area before leaving
for the west coast. Returning to
this area, the two got together
with another Tony to dovolop
and continue their style of origi-
nal country styled music. In
performing and singing, the
group will be using guitars with

Adventure--Escopism

On New Year’s Eve the liner
Poseidon is struck by a ninety
foot tidal wave. The ship cap-
sizes leaving only a handful of
stereotypes alive in the ship’s
main salon. The ﬁlm is the story
of nine of the stereotypes who
attempt to climb up to the
bottom of the ship and escape at
the point the propeller shaft
passes through the hull.

()cnc l'lackman is the head

priest who preaches such revolti-
tionary ideas as the thought that

leads his party consisting of Jack

Rcd Billions as a vacationing

It was the kind of discovery most men and women
work a lifetime for. Yet these young men still have most
of their lifetimes ahead of them.

Why do we give young men and women so much free-
dom and responsibility? Because it's good business, and
we're in business to make a proﬁt. But in furthering our
