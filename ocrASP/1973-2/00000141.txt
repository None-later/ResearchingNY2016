State University at Albany will
ﬁeld a varsity football team be-
ginning next fall, it was announ-
ced Monday by athletic director
Joseph Garcia. Approval to grant
varsity status to football after
three years on the club level was
given by the Athletic Advisory
Board and by Louis T. Benezet.
president of the university. The
move has been recommended by
coach Bob Ford and Garcia.

Ford has guided the Great
Danes to records of 2-4, 4-4. and
61-1 during three club seasons.
The most recent schedule includ'
ed three games with four-year
varsities. against which Albany
compiled a 1-1-1 mark. Next

fall, six of the expanded sched-
ule of nine games will be against
varsity opposition. In addition
to continuing relations with
RlT. Brockport. and Platte-
burgh, the Danes have added
contests with two Massachusetts
colleges, Nichols and Curry, and
with local rival RPl. They also
will play club teams from Stony
Brook. Siena, and Niagara.

“It‘s difﬁcult to schedule for
the immediate future in foot-
ball." noted Garcia. who has
scheduling responsibility for AI-
bany's 20 men‘s intercollegiate
teams. “Most established var-

would ﬁeld a varsity team until
the Board gave ofﬁcial approval.
All-in-all. however, we are pleas-
ed that we have been able to

number of schools have expres-

their schedules when current
commitments run out over the
next few years. “For instance.
we will pick up Norwich in 1975

Pups

by Nathan Salant

The season ended on a
pleasant note last week for the
J.V. Pups, when they capped a
successful year by defeating
Williams in a well balanced, all
around good Performance.
Looking back at the season, this
game told the whole story, as
Kapner pulled 19 rebounds,
Merritt 11 rebounds and 12
points, Alicea scored 10 points,
Eisenman 19, with 7 assists, and
Boyer and Edmonds provided
these key players with vitally
needed rest during the game,

Back in December, when we
went on vacation, the Pups were
burdened by an embarassing 1-4
record. Their defense was weak.
offense fair, and rebounding
almost non-existent.

It looked extremly dismal for
the Pups, attnought there were
some bright spots, particularly
Jim Eisenman and Jose Alicea.

Eisenman, who score 27
points in a losing effor in game
number 1, consistently found
the hoop. averaging 24 points
per game through the ﬁrst five
contests (including his high of
31). Eisenman was rated a fancy
guard. and did the job in

- Steady Improvement All Year

racanbination Rosai-Quattrocchi
style, leading the team in total
points (252), assists (65), and
total field goals, while serving as
ﬁeld general and captain.

Alicea got off to a slow start,
but those double ﬁgures started
entering the scorebook after
game five, and continued for the
remainder of the season. For a
relatively small player Alicea did
a better than average job under
the boards, and came through
with many clutch steals.

When January came, the New
Year brought what were to be
great tidings in the forms of
Harold Merritt, Rich Kapner,
and Ron Edmonds, all of whom
would play a major part in the
rejuvenation of the J.V. Five.

First. came Kripner, a soph
who made the varsity back in
October. but due to an injury
and lack of playing time, was
dropped into the grateful hands
of the JV. to keep in shape and
stay fresh. He responded
quickly, shooting 43% from the
field, and hauling down the
number two notch in
rebounding. The loss to Siena at
the Washington Armory can be

partially attributed to his
absence from the lineup, due to
an ankly injury sustained in the
previous game.

Next came Edmonds, and
unknown quantity of unknown
quality. who came through with
some ﬁnd games in the latter
half of the season. Finding
himself relegated the the “third

guard” position, he readily
entered the game at Coach
Lewis' bidding, and provided

Alicea and Eisenman with much
needeth without reducing our
offensive capabilities.

Lastly. but definitely not
Ieastly, came Harold Merritt.
Merritt, a transfer from Broome
Tech. provided the Pups with a
second big man to help support
Jeff Boyer who was ﬁnding his
hands full with double time at
the center slot. Merritt did it all.
He led the team in rebounds
(120). free throw 7:: (77.5%).
high game (32), average points
per game....  in sum, he could
really pick it, and he did.
although it is generally conceded
by everyone. including Merritt.
that he did not realize his full
potential, especially at the
offensive boards.

Before Christmas came in
January. Jeff Boyer was seeing
all of the action at center.
Naturally, Jeff had his ups and
downs, but he proved to be the
Pups’ No. 1 percentage shooter,

with an excellent 54.1% from
the floor. With the arrival of
Kapner and Merritt, Boyer saw
less action, but continued to do
the job and showed some flashes
of varsity progress.

Then there were the others,
Dan Theberge, Barry Ruzek,
Tom Newman. Royce Russell.
Bill Warner, and Lloyd Dunweil,
all of whom generally did the
job when called upon, thus
providing Coach Lewis with a
fairly reliable bench.

With the season over, it's time
to ask: who shall make varsity
next year. and who shall not.
According to my calculations,
there are at most five empty
spots on next year‘s Great Dane
Kapner has to be
considered a sure shot. especially
since he made the team this
year. Merritt will probably be
called upon to help replaCe some
of the big men in front who will
be graduating. and may very well

Wrestling - A Great Team With A Great

by Kenneth Arduino

“Desire”, "Discipline". “Atti-
tude” and “Pride” are four
words that are posted in the
wrestling room. They are the
key for a successful season and
this year's wrestling team met
them to the letter.

This was a rebound year for
the grapplers who ﬁnished 8-3
and ﬁfth in the SUNY Confer-
ence. It was a “great team ef-
fort," according to Coach Joe
Garcia. “They worked hard to
meet the criterion necessary for
a winning season.“

It was a young team with only
three graduating seniors present,
Captain Jeff Albrecht. Dick
Moody and Jim Dickson, AI-
brecht did a great job at 150 lbs.
He showed little effect of last
year‘s injuries which almost and-
ed his career. An injury to Jeff
in the SUNY Championships
ended any chance he had at the
title. As three year captain. he
was cited by Garcia as an out
standing leader who was able to
combine wrestling and aca-
demics.

Dick Moody at 126 lbs did it
fine job despite limited high
school experience. A real IiiistIr-r
on the mat and team man he was
able to make up many technical
weaknesses. Dickson. who wres-
tled at 177 lbs and 190 lbs also
had limited high school exper-
ience but never failed to make
the matches exciting.

Rudy Vido and Larry Mims

 
  

 

 

TUESDAY, MARCH 6, 1973

were two returnees that a lot
were expected of and they did
not let anyone down. Vido im~
proved steadily throughout the
year winning the SUNY Chllm‘
pionship. Another year of wrest-
ling under his belt and there
should be no stopping him.
Mims was the man who was
expected to pin aan rarely did
he not. Larry has all the moves
and a season without injury
should allow him to reach his
true potential.
Two other
showed steady

returnees who
improvement

were Tom Horn and Doug
Bauer. Both started off slowly
but got hot. For Tom it was his
first full year and his ability
showed. Bauer started the year
wrestling up a weight but found
his home at 167 lbs.

The surprise of the year must
he Wall Katz. Though injured at
the end. Katz who is only a
freshman. impressed all with
cool head under pressure.
Another year of wrestling should
blossom out a new star.

Newcomers Ethan Grossman
and Frank Herman helped carry

the team all year. Grossman was
hot early when the lower
weights carried the team. Her-
man, who started wrestling sec-
ond semester. gave Albany the
depth and strength they neededin
the upper weight classa.

With only three graduating sen-
iors things look good for next
year. Ken Knickmeyer, who
backed up Albrecht at 150 lbs,
should be able to move in at 150
lbs. Transfer Don Mion 190 lbs.
will probably force Herman
down to 177 lbs. Bruce Cum«
mings. who had the years fastest

team with Miller to form next
year’s best forward combination.
With the lots of Roni and
Quattrocchi, Eisenman will
probably fill part of the void at
llieward slot. and assure the
fans of 3 more years of
"Downtown" shah. Alicea also
has a good shot, thanks to a job
well done this year. The hut spot
will probably be up for grabs,
with Boyer and 'nieberge the
most likely candidates. although
everyone will have to be a look
see.

To finish this season and this

article, a quote from Coach
Lewis: “The team deﬁntiely
improved. especially after

January. After all. we did go 9-4
in the second half. and we won 4
of our last 5 games. The
important thing is that we have
dzvelopa‘] several good prospects
for next year’s varsity, and
several others may be a year
away. Recordwise, the overall
season was not as spectacular as
I might have hoped. but 108 is
certainly respectable"

Rest assured. Great Dane fans.
the future is in good hands.

Future

pin against RPI. will also be in
there battling for a spot.

A good team must have good
coaching and Albany had it.
Head coach Joe Garcia has 18
years of experience and know-
ledge to pass on to his young
_team. Assistant Coach Ted Peter-
son did a ﬁne job running prac-
tices and taking over when Gar-
cia was busy as Athletic Direc
tor. He also did a ﬁne job in
building conﬁdence and spirit
among the team.

It was a great year, and next
year looks to be even greater.
