SAIGON ,
The Communists declared on Thursday mght they are suspending

release of the last American prionsers in Vietnam because the United
States went back on a deal for withdrawal of all us. trOOps by the
weekend.

The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong called the altered us.
position "illegal" and refused to hand over the remaining Pows in
Vietnam pending "an appropriate answer from the US. side."

The 138 prisoners had been scheduled for release in two groups
Saturday and Sunday in Hanoi in exchange for an accelerated Ug
troop pullout that would have put American forces out of Vietnam
by Sunday, three days ahead of the deadline in the Paris Consume

FRIDAY, MARCH 2'5, I973

 

by Ronnie Fallon

This spring a new system of
pre-registration will be instituted
at SUNYA-a seniority based
system.

According to this new system,
graduate students will register
first, followed by seniors,

juniors, sophomores, and fresh- .

men. The order of registration
within these levels will be deci-
ded by alpha rotation, which we
know us the previous preregistra-
tion system.

This spring, academic advise-
ment will begin on March 5. The
actual preregistration will begin
Monday, April 9, and continue
through Friday, May 4, in the
Colonial Quad U-Lounge. This
may seem like an unusually long
time period for registration,
however, it is important to note
that there will be a spring recess
from April 14-22. At this time,
the alphabetical order within
class divisions for this spring's
prc-rcgistrziiion has not been de—
ctdcd.

Because of the adoption of the
new grading policy, there will be
a new procedure instituted at
pre-registration. The new grading
system states that students dur-
ing their four years at SUNYA
have the option of taking a maxi-
mum of 30 credits S-U, with no
more than 6 S-U credits in their
major ‘and minor ﬁelds com-
bined. These 30 S-U credits do
not include courses designated
S-U by their departments. There-
fore, at pre-registration, the stu-
dent must sign a card to obtain
S-U grading for an ordinarily
A-E course.

It is important to note that
even iuniors and seniors who
may have been on S-U grading
for their first two years, have the
option to trike an additional 30
S-U credits. This in only possible
because it is a transitional peri-
0d.

A word of caution should also
be given to those students who
are unsure of their rrrtijnr til
minor fields. According to this

new grading system, if a student
takes more than 6 S-U credits in
a ﬁeld and later decides to major
or minor in that ﬁeld, the addi-
tional S-U credits will not be
counted towards fulﬁlling the
requirements. So we see that
even underclassmen should give
careful consideration to choos-
ign S-U courses.

The new systemof pro-registra-
tion was adopted because of
discontent with the alpha rota-
tion system. Under the alpha
rotation system, no consideration
was paid to the student‘s class
year. Juniors and Seniors some-
times found themselves closed
our of courses they needed to
graduate.

Many upperclussmen found
this situation unfair since under-
classmen have more time left at
SUNY'A in which to take the
needed courses. It WIIS also taken
into consideration that upper-
clzissmcrr pity $|50 more tuition
per year, since it was believed

the 300 and 400 level courses,
which required experienced staff
to teach and thus cost more
money.

Statistics also show that upper-
classmen, per ratio of their num-
ber in upper division courses,
drop upper division courses less
often than do underclassmen.
Research results lhave shown
that the drop rate for underclass-
men enrolled in upper-division
(300 and 400 level) courses
(approximately 34%) is consider-
ably greater than the drop rate
for upperclassmeri in upper level
courses (approximately 9‘7).
This means the many upperclass-
men get closed out of courses by
underclassmen who eventually
drop, anyway.

In light of this, the discrimina-
tion against underclassmen dur-
ing pre-registration is justiﬁed,
especially since the underclass-
men will beneﬁt front the sys/
tern when they reach tlppcrclass
status.

Fundamental in the adoption
of the seniority based system
was Sandy tutti, a junior at
SUNYA. A psychology major,
Sandy became aggravated at
being closed out of courses and
decided to do something about
it. She received independent stu-
dy credit for her involved under-
taking which included research,
organization and augmentation
of materials. After months of
hard work and battling the
bureaucracy, Sandy's efforts
were rewarded. In the fall of
I972, the Educational Policies
Council of the University Senate
and the University Administra-
tion accepted the system for the
fall of 1973 implementation.

While the seniority based pre-
registration system will not solve
all the problems, such as closed
courses rind insufﬁcient number
of sections, it is hoped that it
may case some of the aggrava-
tions of pre-registration.
