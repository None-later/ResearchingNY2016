by Ann E. Bunker

Growing up in South Bronx
can be as depressing as poverty
itself, The realities of life offer a
sharp contrast to the American
dream. the ethic that anyone can
go anywhere. The inconsist-
encies of poor housing. local
crime and value differences
combine with other such factors
to create a discouraging environ-
ment.

Among the chief problems of
the South Bronx is its educa-
tional system. At a time when
schools even in relatively well-
off neighborhoods are exper-
iencing problems with educa-
tional effectiveness. schools in
the South Bronx are getting the
problems even more intensely.
The relevance of career-oriented
goals is all but lost under such
conditions.

Many of the kids in this
neighborhood have reading levels
far below satisfactory for their
age group. By the time they
reach junior high. the problem rs
a serious one. There is a need to
strengthen the reading skills of
these kids if they are to continue
on into high school With any
SLICCCSS.

Concern for the
faced by educators
SSouili Bronx (as well as other
areas) has led the State Educa-
tion Department and related
agencies to initiate an innovative

problems
in the

education program called Project
Redesign. The South Bronx
junior high is the New York City
Conponent of the pilot program.

Project Redesign is an attempt
to structure a model school,
utilizing new educational
approaches and technuques.
Called ‘an alternative junior
high,’ the South Bronx compo-
nent hopes to ‘get kids turned
on to learning.‘

An immediate goal of the
program is to improve the
reading skills of kids who are
dangerously behind in reading
development. Proponents of the
program hope to motivate these
kids, making education relevant
to them and their world. This
pilot program also serves to
demonstrate new educational
techniques and strategies that
may come to be employed on a
widespread scale throughout the
state educational system.

In line with the motivational
goal, coordinators of Project
Redesrgn are trying to initiate a
pen pal program between the
junior hiin kids and college
students. The purpose of such a

program is explained by one of

the educators involved:

Recervrng letters from and
sending letter to a college
student rs 50 Simple a concept
but somotivating and exciting
an experience for a student
who has had little or no

contact with people in
college or' outside his or her
tmmedlate environment.
Sharing one's concerns about
growing up with an under-
standing young college stu-
dent ls certainly a positive
outlet tor a Junior high
school student. Ono's tears
about his future and concern
about his won education can

be greatly alleviated by
verbalizing them and
channelling them through

this kind of experience.

Such a program would be
invaluable as a learning force.
The writing practice would be of
considerable merit and could be
used to structure reading within
the program.

Dr. Joseph Bosco of the Center
for Curriculum and Instruction
here at SUNYA is extending a
plea for interested students to be
pen pals with the South Bronx
kids. No great deal of work is
involved; it just takes a little
concern and a few minutes to
share what you can in a letter.

The pen pal program is looking
for two types of persons. They
need aware irrdrvrduals whose
planned profession is mapped
out and who are working toward

.i definite career goal. Such per-

sons can correspond wrtli kids

who express interest in the same
field.

Just as much, however, the

program coordinators are
looking for interested students
whose futures are uncertain stu-
dents who can share with their
junior high kids the realities of
their uncertainties: and hassles.

In both cases, the junior high
students can come to identify
with their pals. Through such
correspondence, the South
Bronx kids may recieve much-
needed educational motivation
while finding a friend.

Of primary inportance in this
program is honesty.There will be
no censorship involved, as
program coordinators are
pushing for the establishment of
frank and candid communica-
tion.

Another important considera—
tion is the trust factor. These

Boyer Accep
State-w

The thorny issue of student
governance in the State Univer-
sity system is about to be re-
solved.

Student govcrnment presidents

from throughout the State
University system met with
Chancellor lirnest L. Boyer

Tuesday afternoon and sources
close to the negotiations say the
Chancellor has “tentatively ac-
cepted" a proposal for an of-
ficially recognized, state-wide
student government that would
represent all SUNY students on
mutual matters of interest. The
Chancellor‘s legal counsel is re-
portedly studying the plan, these
sources say, and the agreement
will be finalized at an April lSth
meeting to be held here in
Albany. Student government
presidents meanwhile, are dis-
cussng the proposal with their
executive governing bodies on
their individual campuses.

The reported agreement cli-
maxes a two year struggle by
various stitderit leaders to obtain
an officially sanctioned state-
wide stirdentgovernment. State
University faculty already have a

similar representative body.

The proposal calls for the cre-
ation of a 64 member Student
Senate that would be composed
of student government pres-
idents and delegates elected pro-
portionally from every schooliii
the State University system. One
delegate would be provided for
every 3500 “full time equi-
valency“ students on each
SUNY campus. Community
colleges would also be guar-
anteed representation under the
proposed set-up.

The group would be officially
recognized by the Chancellor
and the Board of Trustees, the
governing body of State Univer-
sity. Approval of three-fourths
of the local student government
bodies would be required as
well. Funding would come out
of the Chancellor‘s discretionary
funds.

While the new student govern-
ment would be “the final voice"
for all SUNY students on state-
wide topics---Iikc tuition and the
issue of student representation
on the Board of

ts Proposed
ide Student Gov’t

Trustees-«individual campuses
would maintain their own auto-
nomous local student govern-
ments that would deal with
issues of a less broad interest.

For Albany State, this means
the Student Association would
continue its usual operations of
dispensing money to campus
groups and legislating for stu-
dents on this campus. But it
would be expected to defer
issues of statewide interest to
the new Student Senate.

The new government structure
would replace the current SASU
(Student Association of State
University), a confederation of
student governments that is not
officially recognized by the
Trustees. Albaity State is not a
member of SASU.

Leaders of SASU strongly
endorse the new plan and played
a large role in its drafting. They
plan to maintain the SASU
organization as an independent
stttdent service group and hope
the leadership of both
groups---as well as the delegate
meinbersn-will be identical.

Harrington: "We Can Change" (1

Michael Harrington, author of The Other America, a book that
inspired the War on Poverty, lectured Wednesday evening before a
crowd of 150 students. The former chairman of the socialist party, a,
who has for several years supported the contention that the
Democratic party was the basic vehicle for social improvement, told
the audience that “social change must be achieved through the
liberal wing of the democratic party." He noted that socialist
candidates in the past have not been successful in securing more than
ot/rr in a national election, even in the midst ofa capitalist depression.

Stressing party unity, Harrington claimed that unless the working
class under the leadership of AFLCIO president George Meany, and
the liberal left or McGovernitcs can come together, we will not have
a liberal democratic president in the forseeable future. “The two
Georges" (McGovern and Meany) riiust be brought together on
common areas of agreement. One such area he suggested was the
elimination of tax loopholes for the rich and for the corporations.

He called for the creation of a nation-wide coalition made up of
working class Americans, poor and minority groups, the youth and
the liberal working class. “The Democratic Party needs all three and
no one group can doriiiriatc the coalition."

Mr. Harrington ended With a strong condemnation of President
Nixon‘s hindering federal programs created to help the working ‘
class, poor, and retired Clll/.L’n.\.
