The main point concerning Joe
Balt‘ior‘s situation at SUNYA
seems to be that his is another
case of a faculty member who is
supported by students. cummin-
ity‘ and faculty colleagues. yet
will not be remaining at the
university. However. Balfior's
case does not involve tenure,-as
so many recent cases. have.
Rather. it is because Joe Balfior
was not hired at all for a regular
teaching line position that he
will be leaving. Statements cori-
cerriirig the situation have been
made by Ballior‘s supporters and
administration.

Balfior was invited to come
here three years ago on a one
year lectureship contract. Lec-
turesliips do not involve tenure.
After being here a number of
months. according to Btilfior. he
was asked by the chairman of
the Theater Department (at that

return the following year. Bal-
lior said yes;

When the vote to renew Bal-
rior‘s lectureship contract came
before the Theater Department,
Balflor claims that the vote,as.
reported to him by then Chair-
man Pettit, and that it was una-
nimous in his favor. In fact,
Ballior was offered a two year
lectureship contract, which went
into effect.

Last spring Balﬁor was recom-
mended for another one year
lectiireship contract. After the
vote went through the Theater
Department, a majority of which
voted for Balfior the’proposed
contract was turned down by
Ruth Schmidt, Associate Dean
of the Collge of Arts and Sci-
ences.

The reason for this, according
to both Morten Hess, a SUNYA
alumni who heads a committee
working to keep Balfior here,

designed for flexibility and to

Balfior. himself, was under the
impression, due to what Pettit
had told him, that as far as
renewal went, if he went on the
teaching line he would be work-'
ing for tenure, hiit that the
lectureshrp appointments could
go on indeﬁnitely as long as
people wanted him. Because Bal-

of the Theater Dept. voted in
favor of him. But Balfior was
turned down by Schmidt.

According to Hess the reason
for this was that fouro f the
seven tenured faculty lmembers
in the Theater Dept, voted
against Balfior, even though the
three that voted for him‘ inclu-
ded the chairman and two other
faculty members whose fields
are the same as Balfior’s, namely
acting and children's theater,
I'Iess also cited Balﬁor’s lack of a
doctorate as another reason why
Balfior was denied appointment.
Iless feels that this is totally
unwarranted because Balfior,
who is 58 years old, has a
lifetime of experience in the
theater.

Wednesday night that all of
China is ‘a vast scliool.’

Chen was brought here by the
Chinese Club to speak on ‘cduczi-

Chen. flanked by the New
York State, US, and Chinese
ﬂags, did not touch on the con-
troversary. but rather confined
himself to discussing Chinese
education and its development.
Although he spoke of the educa-
tiotial system as it existed in
China before the I949 rcvolu~
lion, he concentrated on the
reforms which directly resulted
front the (heat Prolctariiin Cul-
tural Revolution of the latter
sixties. and which, he said. is still
going on.

kai Shek, whom Mao Tse-tung
and the People’s Liberation
Army ousted from the mainland
in 1949.

Chen said Mao Tse-tung‘s ideas
‘went farther’ than Sun Yat
Sen’s, and that in the intervening
years since I949, Chen esti-
mated China‘s literacy rate has
risen to fifty per cent.

Chen said the Cultural Revolu-
tion was a ‘dodt-yourselfrevolu-
tion.' and that its greatest
accomplishment in the educa-
tional system was the integration
of theory rind practice. Before the
Cultural Revolution, there was
the ‘thrcc-door Student': the
student who went straight from
his home to the university and
then to a professional post and
worked in the
factories or on the farms.

The Cultural Revolution was ‘il
reaction to such clitc specializa-
tion, and it was :i time of it
cacophony of opinions and of
student-run universities. The
climate of the Cultural Revolir
tion encouraged the expression
of individual opinions, and
hand-made posters expressrng
slogans and brief ideas plastered
the universities

In an attempt to give a picture
of the time, Cheri said that first
posters were hung on all avail-
able wall space. When wall space
was taken up, wrics were strung

time, the student again returns

munity in order to prevent the
growth of a new elite. Every
school is afﬁliated with a factory
