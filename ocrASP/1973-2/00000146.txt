Should the United States con-
tinue to provide economic aid to
South Vietnam. Laos, and Cam-
bodia? Should we help rebuild
North Vietnam?

President Nixon, Professor
Kissinger. and POW spokesman
Col. Robinson Risner think we
should; Congress remains un-
convinced while anti-war radicals
just aren‘t sure. But almost no
one has yet tackled the tough,
overriding question: what policy
objectives would Washington use
the aid to pursue?

The answer is far from clear.
Dr. Kissinger. for example. told
NBC that the United States
would not object if the
Communists unified Vietnam
through “peaceful and dem-
ocratic means." while some olr
servers believe that he expects
the Communists to do just that
within a year or twu at most. If
that is trite. then Washington
-vidi-ntly agreed to contribute
‘Io healing the wounds of war
.ind the postwar reconstruction"
either as "reparations" to obtain
a face-saying agreement from the
(Toinniiiiiists. or in keep open
future options With ii (Trim-
miiiiist Vietnam.

'l'his. lllt\\'('Vl'l". would not ex-
plaiii why Washington rushed to
build up Saigon s Air l‘.t)ll‘l' and

Nixon is so willing to risk his
political capital gcttilng the un-
popular $7.?» billion aid packagi-
through an iilrI-ady-liostilc (fini-
gress. Nor does Ihc

that the idea of aid came not
from llaiiiii but from Wash-
Iiigtiiii. wliI-rc ll has l)l't'll under

On balance. then, it seems that

mechanism. This multilateral ap
proach is what the aid p80 kﬂﬂe's
loudest "critics" favor. Senators
Fulbright and Proxmire. for ex-
ample. have blasted the idea of
“American Iiid." while at the
same time offering to support
multilateral aid. “My purpose in
making it (the aid) multilateral
would be to disengage the Am-
erican presence from Indechina
and to allow them to settle their
differences among themselves.“
explained Senator Fulbright. “I
do not think it's our respon-
sibility to continue to dictate
how this part of the world
should be run.“

Whether Nixon is pulling the
wool over Fulbright‘s e,'-s. or
Fulbright is pulling the wool
over the eyes of his anti-A
interventionist supporters. is un-
clear. But when we remember
that former Pentagon chief
Robert McNamara now heads
the World Bank. and that former
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson who has
glowineg spoken of the prof-
itabti- invr'stmcnt opportunities
in South East Asia - heads lltt'
United Nations Development
Programme, the user»; of mult-
llttlt't‘tll aid become clear.

Under such anspiccs, any aid
to North Vietnam would he a far
cry from either l“reparations” or
the ri-ccnt “nirstrings” private
contributions to rebuild the
Bach Mai Hospital in his
l’i-brii: y ‘lli press conference.
Dr. K singer described an! to
llaiioi as “an attempt to enable
the leaders (ll North Vietnam to
work together with other coiiir
tries. and particularly with West
l.‘l’ll countries. In (I m()|’(‘ ('(Hl'

More important. though. by
supporting aid to the
(‘onimunists in the North. Nixon
and Kissinger have further
strengthened their case for a
continuing commitment in the
antrCommiinists in the South.

FRIDAY, MARCH 2'5, l‘l'l‘i

 

 

 

 

 

by Kim Steven .luhase

In 1974 there will be a gubernatorial race. Governor Rockefeller,
who has been in office for 15 years, has not yet stared publicly that
he will run for his fifth term but only that he wants to "keep his

options open. ”

If he decides nor to run, there is only one

Republican who could possibly get the nomination and still keep the
Republicans uniﬁed. That man ls Speaker of the N. Y.5. Assembly

Perry 3. Duryaa Jr.

One reason for the almost universal admiration for Speaker, nor

just from members of his own party but from the Democrats also,
might be thar he is hard to pin down on issues. A: Speaker, he

doesn't have to vote except in 65585 of ties. This makes it impossible

to get his positions from his voting record. When questioned

personally on stars issues, he has a strange talent of seeming to be an

borh sides of an issue. He states that he is strongly for conservation

but than he might see times when the environment might have to be

sacrificed for the economy, He makes a public announcement that
Rockefeller's budget should be cur 60-75 Million dollar: making him
seem likea fiscal conservative. Yer, when lquesr/aned film about the

amount he told me ll was just a minute quantity of no consequence.

The in rerview took place in Duryea'r office located just behind the

Speaker's rostrum. He was Inc/idly and very cooperatr'i/a but he

struck me as a man who has been interwcwed thousands of times

before with nothing new to my.

Q: You were first elected to
the Assembly in 1060. and in 0
short years you rose to the
Speakership. What accounts for
your rapid rise?

A: I’ll have to be very frank in
saying that there was a [rt-men
dous turn river in the Assembly
in lUli-l. President Johnson car-
ried every county in the State
and this meant that younger
men in llll' Assr-mbly. like my-
scll'. were able to move ahead
more rapidly than they would
have been Ullll'rwlsl'. l“l)l' this
reason. I was given an oppor-
Iunity relatively early in my
lcgislzitivr' career to more into ii
leadership capacity.

important cIirci-rwisc for Ii per-
son to change his efforts from
lime to time and I also think
that institutions such as the
legislature gaIii something from a
new personality. a new look.
from time In time. The quote
you are referring to is made to
the fact that I think a person
should arrive on a scene at a
particular job, do the best he can
for sonic specific period of time
and then go on to something
else.

Q: Is there a possibility that
when you feel your time period
in the legislature is up you might
decide to run for Governor?

A: I haven‘t given that much
thought. New York State has an
incumbent chief executive who
indicates that he is considering
running again in 1974 so specu-
lation about what might happen
in the future in so far as that
office is concerned is certainly
previous.

Q: Has Governor Rockefeller
ever personally told you that he
would run for another term?

A: He has not said to me that
he would running again in ‘74
in specific words but he has said
publicly that he is keeping his
options open and he is certainly
considering running for another
term.

Q: Is there competition be-

tween yourself and Majority
Leader of the Senate Warren
Anderson?

A: I think that there is a
friendly competition between
the two houses but I don‘t think
there is competition between

leaders that relates to one trying
to outdo the other or out press
release the other. I have been
extremely close to Warren
Anderson on a personal basis
and I suspect our leadership re-
sponsibilities will bring us even
closer.

Q: You have split with (lover-
Iirir Rockefeller on such matters
as tax cuts and budget cuts. lIt)W
arc your relations \yitli thi-

herent in our system that there
is a division between the execu-
tive, the legislative and judicial
and the Governor respects the
independence of the legislature
and the legislature respects the
independence of the Executive.
Built into our executive budget
system is the need of the Gover-
nor submitting his budget to the
legislature no matter who the
people involved may be and it is
the legislative responsibility to
review that budget; in some cases
to make cuts and in some cases
to reorder priorities and I'm sure
that the Governor recognizes
that when the legislature “does
it's thing." so to speak....that the
legislature is acting responsibly
and is serving the people of the
state...

Q: There has been some ques-
tion as to the extent of New
York State‘s budget surplus.
Why?

A: This is a Variable and it
relates to many different things.
I'll give you iiri exampleAt this
time of year. and the state fiscal
year ends on March 31. New
York State income tax payers in
many instances are receiving
funds. Now if the refunds are
mailed out in March they are
charged against the current fiscle
year. This could cut into a
surplus. The checks could be
dillllyt‘d because of servicing in
the office or in administrative
procedure. In that case. the
checks might not be mailed until
April. 'l‘his item alone of
till 175 million dollars would

out in the form of refunds to
taxpayers next month. That is
the reason why there is so much
question as to the size of the
surplus. Another reason is that
we are doing business in New
York State at the rate of $8
billion is 80 million and that's
not a big variation. Therefore. in
a business this size it’s almost
impossible to predict to the dot-
lar what the surplus may be on
any given day.

Q: This week you suggested
that the Governor's budget
should be cut by 60-75 million
dollars. Where should the cuts be
made?

A: A cut of 60 million is only
V: of 1% of the total budget.
That's not much money. A cut
this size could be an accumula-
tion of a job or two here. a job
of two there; a small program
here. a small program there.

Q: There has been much con-
troversy over the matter of tui-
tion at the State UniVersities
Assemblyman Henderson has in-
troduced a bill to eliminate tui-
tion while there are those who
want to make tuition equal to
that of private schools. Where do
you stand?
