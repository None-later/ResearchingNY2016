a deathblow to private higher
education and this would be a
very serious problem in our
state. A totally free state univer~
sity system might hurt the stu-
dents in the long run because
certainly. if the state were to
assume total cost. it would mean
the growth of the State univer-
sities would be reduced and the
number of seats available in the
future would be leg than other-
wise.

Q: Chancellor Boyer has called
for almost a complete halt in the
expansion of SUNY. Does this
mark the end of the great SUNY
expansion?

A: One of the reasons the state
university system has grown so
tremendously over the past dec-
ade, was that the funds were
available through the state uni-
versity construction fund which.
incidentally. receives its money
from some tuition collection and
other revenues from students
Without that, the growth
wouldn't have been as great as it
was and looking to the future.
even though we may go through
a period now where expansion is
curtailed. we certainly would
not grow as fast. relatively
speaking. as we would if we do
have some income to offset
costs.

9' There has been much de~
bate as to whether there should
be a mandatory student in a:
the state universities. Both Sena-
tor Schermerhom and Senator
March; have introduced bills to
abolish the mandatory tax. Do
you feel that the organization
funded by this tax can get along
or. s volutary basis“

A 1 think they could probably

get along on a voluntary basis.
0n the other hand, this is the
kind of decision 1 would like to
see student government make. l
don't think we in the legislature
should impose our will on cam-
pus in areas of this kind. One of
the great trends in higher educzr
tion nationwide is the participa‘
tion of students in their on
governance and this is the kind
of decision 1 like to see students
make.

Q: You have long been an
advocate for environmental con-
servation and have opposed off-
shore drilling off Long Island.
But is there a possibility that the
economic benefits to New York
from offshore drilling might
outweigh the potential environ
mental hazard?

A: In 1973. I am opposed to
off-shore drilling in New York
State waters. .that‘s not to say
that in the year 2000 when we
have a very serious energy pro
blem that that position should
not be reviewed. Someone will
be around besides me to make
those decmons. I'm sure at ins:
pomt But I think that a decision
of this kind LS a question of
balance Right now we don 1
need energy that might be stored

Pine Bush ﬂ

by David Lcmer

The development of Albany‘s
Pine Bush wilderness area,
moved one step closer following
a public meetingon March 7 at
City Hall. I ‘

Aftermonths of letter writing,
imploring, demanding and wait-
ing, the long anticipated meet-
ing. pitting The People for the
Pine Bush against the Mid‘
Atlantic Construction Corpora-
tion, produced little visible re-
sults. The Mid~Atlantic develo-

rs revealed some vague plans
for their 263 acre. 2,000 unit
housing project in the area,
along with plans for an exten-
sion to the Washington Avenue
Extension. perhaps out to Route
126

The People for the Pine Bush
environmental coalition brought
out their facts as well: the claims
of “environmental uniqueness"
and the fact that 2.5 billion
gallons of pure water from
which Schenectady. Guilderland.
Colonle and Albany all draw
some of their water supply, will
be in serious threat of pollution
if the Pine Bush is covared over.

Despite the insistance that of
the first 32 acres of develop-
ment. 65”: will remain un-
touched. George Keleshlan, Pre-
sident of PYE. said. "Much of
the ground cover will die when
disturbed during construction,
Because of the type (lf soil on
me Pine Bush, a very delicate
balance in the unique area must
remain undisturbed,"

David Barley, of the develop-
.ng company also promised to
