Society:

by Saul-Paul Sirag
AFS

We all know that something is
rotten in America and the world,
and that it just has to change.
But how? One of .the more
interesting proposals to come
along recently is Willis Harman‘s
prediction that parapsycholygy,
by its challenge to the scientiﬁc
and social paradigm of our
culture. will be a major force in
bringing about a new (and bet-
ter) society.

Willis Harman. who made this
prediction at a parapsychology
conference ar U.C. Berkeley
recently. is the Director of the
Center for the Study of Social
Policy at the Stanford Research
Institute and is also Professor of
Engineering-Economic Systems
at Stanford University. Now.
why would such an established
researcher godirectly against the
Btablishment? Answer: they are
desperate.

But it's more complex than
that. The so-called ‘paradigm
change' is already well begun.
(Thomas Kuhn in the The Struc—
ture of SCientriic Revolutions,
1962. popularized the word
‘paradigm' to mean ‘a pattern of
perceiving. valuing. and acting.
associated with a particular view
of man in the universe.‘ so you
might as well get used to it.)

To get on with my point.
signiﬁcant numbers of middle
class people have had ‘lhe
psychedelic experience: “have
had their own paradigms
changed. Some of these
psychedelicists have dropped out
of the dominant culture and
have made an uneasy alliance
With the political leftists, who
got "15" paradigms changed by
reading land further changed by
tear gas ans billy clubs). and the
blacks. most of whom grew up
With nonrestablishment
paradigms.

But the way to cope with
change is to understand it. So
the Establishment says. ‘Who
seems to be into altered states of
consciousness and has not linked
up With the Left? why. it's
psychic researchersl' Yet the
distinctions between Left and
Right itft‘ misleading. In fact.

these distinctions are part of a
paradigm that is itself changing.
What if ESP and psychokinesis
(mind over matter) and reincar
nation are for real? The implica'
tions of parapsyChC’loﬁy 3'9 radi'
Cal. Just listen to what (at least
according to Harman) is i“ issuer

The scientific paradigm thai
parapsychology challenges
assumes: 1. All knowledtle
comes through the physical
senses. 2. Quality reduces to
quantity. 3. We can know only
about the objective not the
subjective. 4. Freedom is an illu-
sion; determinism 5. Conscious-
ness is a passive side effect. 6.
Memory is stored data. 7. Time
is unidirectional. 8. Mind cannot
inﬂuence the world without
physical linkages. 9. Evolution
takes place only through random
mutations. 10. There '5 no survi-
val of the personality at death.

This paradigm is sometimes
Called ‘materiallsm.' and
although Americans tend ro give
lip sen'iec to religious transcen-
dentalism. it is the success of the
materialist paradigmi that has
given rise to the industrial state
with its own paradigm:

l. The dominant (and ade~
quate— value is acquismve m-
aterialism. 2. Efﬁciency is
achieved through subdivision of
work into meaningless small
pieces. the machine method. 3.
The economy can and should
always grow — ‘thc bigger, the
better.’ 4, Nature should be con-
trolled and exploded. 5. The
Search for knowledge is to gain
more control over Nature ii
The indiVidual is the determiner
of the good. society is an aggre-
gation of individuals pursuing
their own interests,:hert~ being
no overriding purpose i except
perhaps survival i.

There are items dear to the
hearts of both Righiists and
Leftists in both of these lists
Yet I think it's clear that thc
psychedelic \‘li‘Vs‘pOlnI challenges
every one of these points. So
Harmon scees the pnrapsy-
chological patadigm as lined up
to a large extent with the lll’
sights of the psj‘chedclice expor-
it-iice. He said lhc L.S.D, was an
important part of his own
paradigm shift. And he CIIL'S

"Pisces Apple lady"

By Ron Simmons

I’m really sorry about Friday
before last. and I had intended
to write the Friday before that
but I didn‘t because that Friday
was my birthday. and man it was
the best fuckin’ birthday in the
world.

I really like my birthdays. not.
because it means something big,
but because I get to go through
this beautiful head trip, where I
get into myself and my own
head. and make a lot of future
plans and examine past mistakes.
And if I start telling people my
birthday is coming. it's not be-
cause I want them to give me
stuff but because it’s on my
mind ti lot and I look forward
to checking myself out.

So this year I decided to start
my self-celebration the Thursday
night before my birthday with a
bottle of wine (Cold Bear). and
my Inst “J.” Then Billy called
me and begged me to come out
to the bur that. night. because we
hadn’t seen each other in it long
time and he hiid forgot it was
my birthday. At first I said no (I
really wanted to be alone) but
then I said OK. for a little
while. So I got stoned and start-
ed getting ready to go out. but I
didn‘t feel like getting “really”
dressed so I wore my smiling
faces t-shirt. . and put on my
wool cap instead of combing my
hair. I looked pretty lousy so I
decided to go all the way and
put on my rhinestone choker
(that I bought in Macy's “Finer
Jewelry" when I was much
younger and had courage) and
one of my larger rhinestone rings
on my index finger.

Anyway I went to the bar and
the usual Thursday night crowd
was there. but. Billy hadn't ar»
rived and I got pissed off be-
cause it was 11:30 and he hiid
said 11:00. So I danced and u

FRIDAY, MARCH 23. 1973

few people wished me it happy
birthday and Keith gave me
something for the head. Then
Billy burst in and without saying
a word. led me by the hand to
the cloak room and gave me this
big piiper bug and yelled “Happy
Birthday" and kissed me ...It
was a cake; a real live birthday
cake! It was a beautiful lemon
chiffon cake that he hiid made
from an old recipe. I was speech-
less (believe it or not) because I
SWear I never expected it. I felt
good! So we danced until the
bar closed and he left before me
and I left with Keith. who's
this really great hairdresser freak.
and really strange. First we got
some more shit for the head. and
then we went to my house to eat
the cake. This was iii about 3:30
in the morning and I had been
23 for 3 hours already and I
wasn‘t really hungry. so we de-
cided to work up a case of the
munchies and play some records
first and Keith told me that he
had never heard of “Osibisu.”
which is my favorite group, so I
played some of my favorite
tracks and we were starting to
get into them when Danny (my
roommate) and Pauline walked
in. So we all worked up a big
case of the munchies and went
to the kitchen to eat cake and
milk and Isaid it would be nice
if we had candles...And the next
thing I knew Danny had put 3
candles on the cake- and turned
out all the lights and they all
started singing "Happy Birthday
To You." I fell. like a kid again
and wanted to cry and shit. I
mean I felt so fuckin’ good!

The cake was ﬂawless and we
ate half and then Keith and
Plluli‘ie left and I wrote in my
diary and went to bed at about
5:00.

Friday at 9 am. the plumbers
came to fix the bathroom wall
and started tearing it down. I got
up and went into the kitchen
and found out that Danny
hadn't gone to work. which was
sort of ii downer because I hiid
wanted to be iilone. So I got
stoned again and went out for u
bottle of wine. The day was so
beautiful! I felt like it spring
commercial. Rita. Peter and
Chip were walking down the.
street um] I invited them to stop
up. Chip did so we drank Lind
got higher. Then someone
knocked at the door and Estelle
come in with it birthday card and
ti bottle of Cream White Coir
cord. which freaked me out lie-
caiusc the only time 1 MW it is
when I'm home in Brooklyn
smoking on the park bench and
wv chip in to buy u Lastc. llovc
the stuff. So we got even higher
iiiid someone else knocked lit the
door and Keith walked in look-
ing really cool in ii dutigiirec
jllL'kt’l. and jeans and wide (lurk
sunglasses. He hiid some more
stuff for the bend and we started
gelling high llll ovur again and l

...’l‘lie plumbers freaked out. I
HI'VCr saw two men work no hard
iiiid fuel to repair ii wall in my
life. But they couldn’t finiah and
decided to come back the next
diiy, So we ate the rest of the

_,___..._._-—-——

cake and talked about Arnold's
party the next night and what
we should wear and I realized I
didn't have anything and got
sort of down. Then they all left.
and I cleaned up the house and
played records and got the mail:
a card from Annie. and one from
my parents with a check for $20
which made me feel good. Then
Danny cooked a great dinner
and liiter I invited Benny and
Carol over. and later my mother
called and I spoke to the whole
family and felt even better. Then
ii package came for me and it
was it gift from Jonie in Roches-
ter. who is my favorite female
person and the only straight girl
I'm in love with. It was it book
called Journey into lxtlan by a
guy called Carlos Castaneda. and
it’s all about this Indian named
Don Juan. Later on I went to
the bar and came back and went
to bed. I was really exhausted
but boy did I feel good.

When I woke up Saturday I
found Publio sleeping on the
sofa and Keith sleeping with
Danny and plumbers freaking
out again and working faster
than they had the day before.
We all washed up in the kitchen
and Publio went to the store and
bought some stuff to make
French toast for breakfast. We
decided to act like faggots and
ate in the dining room and used
the good china. and new silver.
with the percolator on the table.
While we were eating and listen-
ing to Ella Fitzgerald ‘5 Greatest
Hits 1936-1939. we started disv
cussing Arnold's again and how
we didn’t have any money to
buy something new. And just
when we were thinking of how
to come up with a new combina-
tion of our used clothes the mail
came in and Danny received his
tax return. We were rich! Danny
and I said good-bye to everyone
and. running in the rain. hailed ii
cab to Colonic Center only to
find nothing chs'. tres‘ chic
enough for our tastes, and re-
turned to Armadildoe. Danny
bought an entire outfit from
shirt to shoes and jewels. but I
couldn't afford anything big so I
decided to “go simple" and
bought this "darling" little pink
terrycloth “nothing” to wear
over my bare shoulders and
niiked chest; unbuttoned of
course...The party was ﬂawless
and so were we. Derrick decided
to wear white double knit trim~
mad with red feather boa. and I
got high and thought he was the
“Ghost of Christmas Never
Was.” Eventually I got higher
and then but and started an
gilging in foreplay with different
guests on Arnold's bed. Then I
brought one of them home and
finished where we left off.

'l‘hc next morning the guest

Kerner Exposed By Press

Who told on Kerner?

He remained a governor for
two terms and then was appoint-
ed a federal judge through an
assortment of administrations in
Washington.

Meanwhile. Democrats who
used to be able to cover for one
another remained in absolute
control of party machinery in
Chicago.

If Kerner. popular, respected.
esteemed. had all that clout and
all those friends-"then who told
on him?

Kerner’s undoing began when
it snoopy newspaper reporter
from the Chicago American dis-
covered thiit car dealers were
cheating the state on sales taxes.
The state revenue director-the
man who let it. happen-- was it
close friend. personal counsel
and campaign manager for Ker-
ner.

But because of Kerner's im-
peccable reputation. he was able
to shift the blame from his
friend by promising to find and
prosecute the guilty-which he
never did.

But the window was open a
crack.

It was a Chicago newspaper,
Chicago Today. which identified
the number two man in the
Illinois State Revenue Depart-
ment as a syndicate payroller.

It was a Chicago newspaper
which exposed a dummy com-
pany prospering on state busi-
ness and run by Kerner’a closest
friend.

It was Chicago newspapers
which hucktracked on that

ron hendren

friend. Ted Issues. to discover he
had it hand in or control of state
boards which regulated banking.
insurance. savings and loans.
liquor sales--and racing.

By July of 1971. handsome,
personable Otto Kerner was be-
fore a federal grand jury investi-
gating race track stock deals and
admitting to the ownership of
substantial race track stock him-
self.

Yet it remained for Chicago
newspapers to throw open the
window. Kerner had bought that
stock at. a bargain basement
price. sold it for what it was
worth and had reported the in-
come ais a “capital gain."

But. because he had ruled so
consistently in favor of the race
track people who had been so
generous with him. the news
media, the public and the federal
authorities were alerted.

It's interesting-bribe money
which he’d claimed as a capital
gain apparently should always be
identified by politicians as
“regular income."

Anyway. the US. Department
of Justice was able to readily
weave the rest of the web.

But what I'm saying is that
lawmen were alerted two years
ago by newsmen who sniffed the
first of this stink eight years ago
when they persistently pursued
leads from clandestine sources
because they were free to. May
they ever be.

And who also dared to ques-
tion the propriety of a political
crown prince.

May they ever dare.

Young View of Washington

Human Guinea Pigs

It wasn’t much. they told the
prisoner. just minor surgery on
his brain designed to make him
less violent. and with the surgery
came the promise of freedom.

A scene out of 1984'? No. The
time is today and the location is
the California Medical Facility tit
Vucavillc. where operations like
the one described above were
recently performed on three
prisoners.

What the prisoners were not
told is that the poychoaurgery
would render them incapable of
feeling pleasure or sadness. and
would forever render decision
making difficult for them.

But the end goal was achelved--
permanently altering the sub»
jects" behavior-and that seem
to be enough to satisfy it grow-
ing number of medical and gov-
crnmcnt authorities who support
psychosurgery.

I’syclioiiurgery is just one of
the many forms of experiment-
utions which are being conduct-
ed on humans toduy. often with-
out Lhcir full undarstunding and
soml‘lltnl'ﬁ without their know—
lctlgc.

Sciiiilor Hubert H. l'lumphrcy
(l)»Miiiii.) lutu lust month intro»
diiccd legislation to act rigorous
guidelines goVerning medical ex-
periments involving people,

He reminded hiii colleagues of
u biirbiiric syphillia‘ study involv-
ing till) black men which was
conducted over u period of -IO
yours in Alabama. The men. all
afflicted with uyphillia, were
given $50 plus buriul expenses
to undergo treatment for their
disease. At laiiiit 28 and perhaps
as many us 10'] died us it result.

Humphrey iiald the fact that
these men volunteered is clear

indication that consent of those
involved is a totally inadequate
standard. The most dangerous
experiments almost always find
the poor and uneducated as their
subjects. people who may not be
able to understand or fully com-
prehend the danger to which
they will be exposed.

In some cases. according to
Humphrey, individuals may not
even be aware they are the sub-
jects of ii teat. Recently. accord-
ing to associates of consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, the Uni-
versity of Michigan dispensed di-
ethystilbestrol (DES) to coeds
who feared they might be preg-
nant. DES is a synthetic estrogen
which has been linked to cancer.
The daughters of some 840
women who were given DES in
the early 1950's are now found
to experience it high rate of
malignancies. according to
Humphrey.

’I‘o stern unwarranted and
overly dangerous experiments on
humans, Humphrey has pro-
posed to establish a National
Human Experimentation Stun-
durds Board. an independent
agency authorized to draw up
rigorous guidelines governing hu-
man experimentation in projects
financed by federal funds.

The board would have iiub~
poeiiu power and the right to
hold hearings; it could obtain
injunctions to halt experiments
not in compliance with its guide-
lines.

Meanwhile. the experiments
go on. and the majority of physi-
cians conducting them. says
Humphrey. have never even
studied the ethics of tasting.
