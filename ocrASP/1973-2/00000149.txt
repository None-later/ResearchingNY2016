"Big Star" is Sparkling

By Greg Shaw

A change is about to come
over pop music that is sure to
take many by surprise. It may
not happen overnight, but hep-
pen it will. and within a year.
What am 1 talking about? Well.
unless I turn out to be wrong for
the first time in my seven years
as a paid observer of the rock
scene, I do believe that singles
are about to regain the impor-
tance they held prior to 1967.
And not just any singles, but the
kind of exquisite, finely crafted
masterworks of pop rock that
poured out. of England before
flower power hit.

I‘m not gonna try to build a
case here because I get 500 new
singles every month and can see
trends building, and you
Wouldn't be able to find mnsl. of
the examples I could cite (but
take note of the Raspberries,
Rowan Bros. Move, Mott the
Hoople, Slade...and of course
R&B. which has never amounted
to much outside of hit singles.
yet is becoming the biggest thing
in pop. totally dominating the
charts) but just take my word.

And not only are singles
themselves coming back. but
they‘re coming from England
like nvvvr liel'oro lWho 502 we
can‘l he lllvutlﬂi twice?) and
now by Amuncan groups trying
to sound English. Yeah, the
Raspberries, but I have in mind
:in won more valid example.

.\ group called Big Star has
released their first album on
Ardent 2803. Ardent is a local
Memphis label with only one
other artist on its roster. and it
looks llkl' becoming an impor-

l:ml rompany on the basis of
this album. Bu: Star features
Alon Chilton, formerly vocnlisl

\‘Vllh the Box Tops. but this
group sounds nothing like the
olhI-r. Whlll ll sounds like is all
[hosi- great English singles l was
lulking about. That puts them a
quantum jump ahead of the
llzipshurrws. although they lose a
low noslnlgin points in the bar
gain.

Seldom hilVl‘ I heard a song
cry out to be on the radio the
way “When My Baby’s Beside
Mo" does. As catchy ns uny great
light pop single could possibly
ilhplri‘ to be, it stands with the
best of ti e Hollies or Budlinger.
Unlike the heavy lead vocal of
the Box Tops, Chilton blends his
VOICl‘ with co-Ieader Christopher

(Solution to last week's puzzle)

 

Bell to produce a full satisfying
Hollies harmony. and the rest of
the group backs up with instru-
mental and stylistic precision.
It‘s hard to believe this album
was made in Memphis. There’s a
track called “Feel” that sounds
like a cross between Led Zeppe-
lin and the Sweet. “In the
Street" sounds like Budfinger
not imitating the Beatles. “Don‘t
Lie to Me" sounds like a com-
bination Humble Pie and Yard-
birds. “My Life is Right." sounds
like Bedfinger when it's imita-
ting the Beatles. The whole al-
bum. in fact, has that warm.
exhubernnt freshness always
found in the best English pop.
That’s about the highest
praise I can offer. other than to
say Big Star doesn’t overwhelm
you with its Englishness. the

way almost every other Ameri-
een Angloid group from Christo-
pher Milk back to the Knicker-
bockers has done. Their sound is
genuinely their own, and it’s one
you’ll grow to love for the
uniquely crisp acoustic guitar
style as well an the more deriv-
atlve vocal harmonies.

This is the kind of group that
ought to be producing Top Ten
singles like clockwork, and will
be if the direction of pop music
continues to change in the direc-
tion I've already indicated.
There are in fact four likely
candidates on this album. So if
you appreciate a good pop rec-
ord the way I do, why not get
this album now and let the rest
of the world catch up at their
own speed? Being ahead of your
time has never been so easy.
