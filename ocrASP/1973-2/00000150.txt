films—my aims. It is a difficult and dangerous
question, and I usually give an evasive answer: I try
to tell the truth about the human condition, the

l truth as I see it. This ansWer seems to satisfy
' everyone, but it is not quite correct. I prefer to

describe what I would like my aim to be.”

—Ingmar Bergman
There is a good possibility that Sweden's Ingmar
Bergman may well be the single most powerfulforce
in modern cinema. His ﬁlms are unmatched in
complexity and honesty, and their perceptive in-
vestigations into the nature of man are without

peer. Like no one else, Bergman is a ﬁlmic poet.

Mar. 23rd) at 7:15 & 9:45 in LC IB, is Smiles ofa
Summer Night, a comedy about love, deception and
misdirected dignity. At the turn of the century, a
wealthy lawyer goes to his former mistress to see if
she can do anything to help make his young wife
more affectionate. The mistress, however, is of a

mind of her own.

While enjoyable as a romantic comedy the ﬁlm is
also a good deal more. In his book on Bergman,
Robin Wood wrote, “With its own individual and
complex ﬂavour, the astringency balanced and
modified by qualities of warmth, tenderness and
charm, Smiles ofa Summer Night remains one of
Bergman’s perfect films.” The film is also the source
of the new Hal Prince - Steven Sondheim musical A

Little Night Music.

Smiles of a Summer Night will be joined by a
short film called The Dave by George Coe and

 

Advance tickets for the Bergman Trilogy will be
on sale tonight at the door of LC I8 before the
screenings of Smiles of a Summer Night.

The ﬁnal film in the series, presented on Friday,
1C 18, is one of
Bergman's most recent films, The Passion ofAnna
made in 1970. On a small island we meet a number
of characters all in some way controlled by guilt
over their pasts. Anna feels responsible for the
motor accident that killed her husband and son and
those around her carry with them the ghosts of
failed marriages, lost dreams and unhappy love
affairs. Beyond these private guilts the community

actress and a long time member of the “Bergman
Players" who include Max von Sydow, Gunnar
Bjornstrand, Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and
Ingrid Thulin. This brings us to the matter of acting
in the films of Ingmar Bergman.

Bergman's company of actors includes some of the
ﬁnest and most gifted talents in the world. Each one
offers an almost impossible consistency of per-
fection. They are another reason why these ﬁlms are
so rewarding.

Bergman films are not simple to understand; they
do not serve their message on a plate. These films
invite you to a challenge; a challenge to seek the

Country dancing is a unique
