AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT BENEZ'ET

March 20, 1973

Dr. Benezet: .
What are the Lealreasons for Dean Schmidt’s rejection of the Department

of Theatre’s recommendation that Joe Balfior be rehired next year? Can it

be that such reasons are so lacking of objective merit that they could not
stand open scrutiny?

Why will neither you nor Dean Schmidt consent to a meeting with
concerned alumni having possession of expert personal knbwledge in the
matter, to hear additional testimony on Mr. Balfior’s ability and potential
value to the University, and to consider a. rebuttal of the arbitrary and
fallacious reasoning in the ofﬁcial explanation of your Administration's
action? Can you possibly believe that the Dean's information was so
complete, and her judgment of such omniscient quality, as to preclude the
remotest possibility of error on this decision?

Why do you refuse even to acknowledge your responsibility for reviewing
a questionable decision of the person to whom you have delegated some of
your duties? A competent administrator does not abdicate responsibility
when he delegates it.

When all appeals for a responsible discussion between reasonable people
are rejected out of hand, as has been the case in this situation, it seems
justified to publish the facts as we see them, with the onus of any
misconception falling upon the parties which rejected the opportunity to
correct them.

The following statements represent, in our opinion, a probable ex-
planation of your Administration’s actions in this matter:

1. You find proven teaching ability of little consequence without support
of academic degrees; even a lifetime of professional experience is given no
weight.

2. The vote of four faculty members whose expertise is in other areas was
given greater credence than the vote of those best qualified in the field to
which the appointment is to be made, and contrary to an outstanding
recommendation by the Department chairman and the unanimous support
of student representatives. It appears reasonable to ascribe at least part of
the negative voting to intra-departmental politics irrelevant to Mr. Balfior’s
qualifications, and the Dean’s decision to a desire to give support to the
faction so voting.

3. You are quite glib with speeches to alumni about your desire that they
manifest continuing concern for their alma mater, but demonstrated by your
arrogant and close-minded refusal to see us, that your opinion of our

Oldies But Goodies

Beginning Monday evening and for several evenings to Follow over 100
SUNYA alumni and students will start a massive “Plionathon” campaign in
support of the Alumni Annual Fund Drive.

The “Phonathon” objective is to gain enough support for the building of
[ltL‘ proposed Alumni House-Conference Center complex. Somc $175,000 is
needed before construction can begin on the facility. which is to be located
near the campus lake. I

The volunteers will meet in the lower lounge of Fulton Hall, where some
30 telephones have already been installed. and will then call about 4.000
ilunini throughout the United States.

The need tor a c'tililt‘i't‘liic' facility on campus is obvious. it will serve as
the local point ol alumni activity on campus. and will provide much needed
Space for conferences. meetings. and continuing, education programs. It will
reduce miich oi the hcavy burden being placcd on the vcrcrowdcd
