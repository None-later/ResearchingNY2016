The ECAC Basketball Tourna-
merit marked the closing of the
Albany Great Dane basketball
season and for five Dane cagers,
it was their last game in an
Albany uniform. Bob Rossi,
Dave Welchons, John Quat-
trochi, Bob Curtlss and Werner
Kolln will all be sorely missed.

For Bob Rossi it was his best
all around season. Always
known for his outside shooting
and sometimes criticized for his
bombing, Bob never had much
of a reputation for defense or
ball handling. But this year, im-
provement in both these depart-
ments was evident and Bob got
more playing time.

The “Bob Rossi bombs" were

still evident but were more con-
trolled as Roui led the outside
shooting attacks against the
zone. His outstanding Capital
District Tournament was a high
light of his career along with last
year's last second heroics.

Dave Welchons is Mr. Defense
for the Danes and this season
was no exception. Dave who
usually draws the other teams
top scoring guard did an out-
standing job on defense. Dave
also was a valuable ball handler
which helped break the press.

Welchon's problem was his
lack of offense, though he jmda
high shooting percentage. He
proved that a man can con-
tribute without scoring many
points.

Two year captain, John Quat-

trochi. was a super ballplayer all
three years. A team leader in
assists and steals, John set the
tempo for the club. This year he
concentrated less on scoring, yet
he greatly contributed. He was
nationally ranked in foul shoot-
ing for the last two years.

But statistics don't show his
value. Quattrocchi made the
Capital District all tournament
team two years in a row, includ-
ing a twenty-five point perfor-
mance this year. Making the two
winning foul shots against
Williams in the closing seconds.
Scoring the ﬁrst nine points in
the opening round of the
ECAC‘s. Truly a clutch per~
former and team leader.

Bob Curtiss lost his starting job
this year during pre-season. Yet,
he started every game. An injury

It was a very long and very
frustrating season for the Albany
Great Dane basketball team.
Frustrating all the way to the
end - that coming when the
Union Dutchmen outplayed the
Danes in the ECAC Champion-
ship Game 69-64. The tourna-
ment was just as mysterious to
Albany fans as parts of the
regular season. For in the open-
ing round the Danes played a
magniﬁcent ﬁrst half against a
so-so St. Lawrence ﬁve, taking a
41-19 spread into the locker-
room. Albany eased over the
Larries 69-55, and Great Dane
rooters pointed to the ECAC
Championship plaque. There was
to be one big obstacle though,
Union.

The Dutchmen had certain
thing going for them in the

 
      

 

tourney. To begin with, there
was the vivid memory of the
Capitol District Championship
Game in December played at
Union and won by the Great
Danes in overtime 57-52. There
also was a loud group of Union
fans. in the half-full University
Gym.

The opening game was Union
and Fredonia. As expected, it
was a boring defensive game won
by Union 46-38. The trip to
Albany proved to be very embar-
rassing for Fredonia, as they also
lost the consolation game to St.
Lawrence 67-36.

The second game Friday saw
the Danes rip apart St. Law-
rence. John Quattrocchi scored
Albany’s ﬁrst 9 points, as they
raced to a 9-2 lead, one that
would only widen. Harry John-
son came off the bench to score

‘1'

8, as he, Byron Miller, and Bob
Rossi blew it open. Troch ﬁnish-
ed with 16, Harry and Byron
had 12, and Rossi added 10 in
the impressive Albany win.

But tomorrow was a new day.
Troch started the Championship
Game hot again, scoring 7 points
early to lead the Danes to a
18-10 edge. After a sloppy be-
ginning by both teams, the game
settled into a pattern: Union
using a very tough man-to-man
defense, and on offense, 8 pa-
tient, disciplined, penetrating
game - Albany was hitting the
offensive boards and also playing
good defense, but they were
fouling and committing too
many turnovers.

As the half progressed, Union
ever so slowly pulled away. Pa-
ced by forward Mike Doyle, the
tourney MVP, the Dutchmen
built a 36-31 edge at inter-
mission. The stats showed the
Danes shooting as well as Union
(15-32 to 13-27). rebounding
better (21 to 1‘1), and still
losing. The difference was turn-
overs and free throws. rl‘he
Danes had 6 more mistakes than
the opposition, while at the
Charity stripe, Alhnny was only
1-2. Union was 10-14.

To the delight of their noisy



maqnlen

Danes End Frustrating Season; Lose in ECAC Finals

following, the Dutchmen reeled
off ﬁve straight points to open
the second half. Albany kept
throwing the ball away, not
penetrating, and getting deeper
and deeper in trouble. The situa-
tion got worse when Bob Curtiss
and Byron Miller both received
their 4th personal. At 12:00.
Union led 49-37 and the Union
fans were eating it up.

Byron was left in with four
fouls. It was now do-or-die - the
Danes needed someone. The
someone was Bob Rossi. As
erratic during the year as the
team, Rossi chose now to put it
all together. The senior guard hit
two free throws, a jumper, made
a steal and two more foul shots
to spark the Danes. The dormant
Albany fans roared to life when
Byron scored on a drive and
Rossi clicked another jumper,
and so did Byron. At 7:25,
Miller scored on a breakaway as
the Danes drew to within 54-51.

Union called time out to re-
group. It was here that Albany
had severe defensive lapses.
Charlie Gugliotta scored an un-
contested lay up, and two Al-
bany fouls led to four more
Union points. Bob Rossi’s two
steals resparked the Danes. Bob
Curtiss hit a lay up and Werner

 
 
 

   
 
   

Kolln made a three point play to
cut it to 60-56. But Doyle scor-
ed on a give and go lay up to up
the margin to six. Kolln's jumper
put it back to four but that was
it. Union scored ﬁve straight
points, used a four corner stall,
and won the Championship.

The daZed Great Danes sat
motionless on the bench, as the
All-Tourney team was announ-
ced. It consisted of Byron Miller,
Jim Bassett of St. Lawrence, and
3 Dutchmen: MVP Doyle, Geoff
Walker, and John Dennio. Union
had played a great defensitIe
game, and were also impressive
with their style of offense. They
were well coached and showed
great desire.

The ﬁnal stats were similar to
the ﬁrst half: both teams shot
48% - Albany out-rebounded
Union 33-29. and out-
"turnovered" them 22-11. The
Danes were 8-9 from the foul
line, Union 19-28. Enough stats -
you the reader along with me
the writer, are a little weary of
basketball. Although it was an
up and down frustrating year for
the 17-8 Danes, the many high
points made it very exciting.
Now it's over. Goodbye and
thanks to Troch, Rossi, Dave,
Werner and Bob. We will miss
you.
