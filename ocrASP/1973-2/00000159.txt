Women's liberation at SUNYA Takes Many Forms '

by Patti Maslinoff

The Women 's Liberation illui'c»
men! is alive and well on (he
Albany Slate Campus. [in] i/
sccnn‘ In many rim! it has been
opera/ng underground for no!
loo much is known dbl)!!! it.
There are several different
groups each will] difﬁwnl goals
and activities.

The start of the Women's
Movement at SUNYA is hard to
determine for many of the
women originally involved have
disappeared. Piecing to ,cther the
various bits of in.ormation it
appears. that the birth of the
Women's Movement on the
Albany Campus was during the
student strike of Spring 1970.
Thr- Assembly Hall had been
taken over to serve as a Day Care
Center and a Women's group
bcgati to develop. Throughout
this period and the following
year, thcy bore the _titlc of
Women's Liberation Front. This
is an indication of their radical
and political nature, similar to
the leftist movement of the
time. The problems bctwccn
thosc women more politicized,
and those women who preferred
conciousness raising was the
major source of conflit during
the fall semester of lEiTt). Most
ot' the womcn in this original
group split to join other groups
which lll'iil'l" fit them. A cooling
period followed, and in the Fall
ltl'il, the Women's Liberation
(iroup arosc on Campos Accord-
ing to Slicrry Sussman, who has
lu-i-n Iti\'Uth‘(l front the begin
ning, the Women's Group now
has a more positivr- approach..-
“Jtist keeping it ongoing is fati-
t.i.stic "

ltul part of tbc reason that llll'
Women's Movement has liccn

funded by student

 

Your senior portraits for the

active on the Albany campus is
that it is not restricted to one
group. Women's Liberation is an
intensely personal experience.
Each woman needs to express
herself in an individual way and
the variety of groups and activi-
ties on this campus reﬂects this
need.

The Women's Liberation
Group is an SA funded “cultur-
al” activity. According to Peggy
Nadler, who presently heads the
group, “its purpOse as stated in
the Constitution is to inform
men and women in the
university community of prob-
lems which face women and to
find solutions to remedy them.
We do this through films and
speakers.

The group meets every
Monday, alternating its format
every week, for a three week
period.

A film is presented on the first
Monday. The purpose of the
documentaries is information.
This year, though other films
have been sliowu which accord-
ing to Peggy are very similar to
films shown in much of the
media today. Hopefully, bccaustI
they are shown by Women‘s
Liberation, viewers will take a
deeper look.

A speaker generally is on the
agenda for the second Monday.
'l‘lu- speakers have come from
out of the area, within the
Albany community, and from
the unwcrsily, 'l‘opics haw-
included women in the church,
media and ('(lllt‘uilllli.

The speakers and films [)i‘UVltll'
a sourcc of “(WV ideas to be
discussed as a group and to In-
i-xamincrl personally. Andrea
explained Lllc reasons that shr-
attends the films anti spcakcrs:

“i feel ascnsc ofunity that what
I face is not unique and may be
shared by women all over the
world. I realize that other
women are confronted with the
same problems."

The third week is a business
meeting. Discussions include
plans for action, weekend
conventions in the area and new
ideas to be explored. Generally,
these are thrown open to the
group and then followed
through by individuals.

A group of women ris‘ now
working on an April 6, 7, 8
weekend convention to be held
at Albany State. It is intended to
covor a broad spectrum of
interests from its start on Friday
eyening until the conclusion
Sunday afternoon. The tentative
plans schedule a speaker for
Friday night to lecture on
Women and the Media. It will be
followed by thiI entertainment. at
Henways of the band-Sweet
Jenny Grit. Workshops are
planned for Saturday. The topics
are to include: Women in
Politics, Verbal Karate,
Abortion, Women in Literature,
Womcn in Medicine, Feminist.
Cou ns‘cli n g, Housewives,
Secretaries, Women in Prisons,
Lesbianism, Women in Science,
Women in Media, Self-Defense,

Saturday night should feature

Peggy 7-5l84). The weekend will
conclude with a party and
speaker on Sunday.

Another group of women
within the Women's Liberation
Group concerned about the
gynecological services on
campus. Barbara Mntilsky felt
that the services offered on cam-
pus were inadequate and invest.
igated a full—time gynecologist
and/or clinic. She was prepared
to do the arranging but found
Dr. Janet Hood to disapprove of
the idea. Dr. Hood, according to
Barbara, feels that the facilities
offered in downtown Albany are
sufficient. Barbara feels that a
more student-oriented clinic is
needed with sensitivity and ser-
vices (including education)
geared to the needs of the
female student. The possibility
looks very dim, and Barbara
added, We have to educate our-
selves. We never can learn
enough about our own body. it's
our body and our respon»
sibilily,"

Consciousness Raising Groups,
although originally started
through the Women's Liberation
Group, now operate separately
and on their own momentum.
State Quads Consciousness
Raising Group meets weekly and
according to Barbara Malilsky
and Sue Potter, both activtI with
this group, it has been a very
liclpful and growing experience.
What is II‘.’ 'I'ht-y dcscrihc it as a
"a small group of women who
discuss things prevalent on their
minds, ol'l'cr ideas and prcparc

cast into the “feminine” rate,
how to deal with jealousy in
women and present and future
roles in society. And even if no
conclusions or answers are
reached, it is helpful to know
others are in the same situation.
Barbara and Sue stressed some
of the misconceptions that both
men and women have of
Women‘s Liberation and
consciousness raising. They feel
that it is more of a “liberation of
people" and that “men don't
realize how much they will bene-
fit." To exemplify this
statement, they told of an
incident several weeks ago, at
which several male friends were
invited to it consciousness raising
meeting to because of a desire to
communicate and to
demonstrate that this group does
not see itself as “against men."
They went apprehensivcly, but
came out beginning to
understand, as one of the men
felt the next time that he picked
up a copy of Playboy. Barbara
said that men are surprised to
find that the women in
Consciousness Raising are
“good-looking" and have
boyfriends, which destroys the
myth that women are involved
in Women's Liberation because
they are ugly and can't get
married.

The Women‘s Student Caucus
is another student group on
campus. This differs from the
Women's- Liberation Group in
that it is a branch of SUNY~widc
organizationMSlNY Women's
(faucus. This group, which
Maryann Topccck presently
heads, deals with (in-campus
