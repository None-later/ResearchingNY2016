women's liberation at SUNYA

the quota system for males and
females regarding entrance to
the unviersity. Because of this,
MnryAnn says, it is necessary for
a female to have a higher average
than a male. They are concerned
with sexism in class-remarks
made by professors. Many of
thuse involved in this group are
graduate students and thus con-
cern often centers about pro—
blems for the graduate student
such as--femalesl receive accor-
ding to MaryAnn propor-
tionately less grants than males
and the need for day care cen-
ters. There has been a day care
center in Pierce Hall, yet it is
now failing due to inadequate
funds and workers.

The Women's Faculty Caucus
headed by Ms. Joan Schultz of
the English Department, is
another branch of the SUNY
Women‘s Caucus. It also is
concerned mainly with
university problems, especially
in relation to the women
faculty. “It is the academic
world‘s equivalent to NOW
(National Organization of
Women)“ said Ms. Lois
Sklepowich. “It is not a personal
or psychological group, but
rather very political and
effective.“

in general, the Women's
Faculty Caucus is concerned
with the fair employment of
women. Much to their delight,
Albany State has chosen by the
federal government to be investi-
gated in terms of eqqu employ-
ment of minority groups in a
study entitled Affirmative
Action Plan. The equality of
employment of women is now
under investigation and a report
is expected sometime this year.
Recently, an Equal Employment
officer for women, Dolores

Roger

Barracana Schmidt, was appoint-
ed, with the Caucus’s help in the
screening and selection of
applicants. A subcommittee of
the Women's Faculty Caucus is
now working on the Women's
Studies Program. They recently
instituted a Women’s Studies
Minor and are discussing plans
for the future, (perhaps a major)
but it was not done without a
complex history of events:

In early 197i, Mr. irving
Verschoor, then Dean of General
Studies, received letters from
women in the community in-
quiring about the possiblity of
women's courses. Ms. Elinore
Posner, also involved with the
General Studies program,
contacted M. Diva Daims, of the
English Department, to discuss
the possibilities. Ms. Daims, Ms.
Joan Schultz, and others met
together to plan courses. By the
end of the semester, though they
were told that there was no
money available. However,
during that summer, Daims and
Schultz were notified that in the
Fall, ANS 300 Women in
Modern Literature would he
offered. They taught the course
jointly, adding it to the full
schedule, because the English
Department did not recognize it
as part of their load
requirement. However, the
Department course committee
ﬁnally passed approval and last
Fall semester, ENG 3|3, Women
in Modern Literature was

offered.
Daims feels that a Women‘s

Studies course such as Women in
Modern Literature, which she
teaches explores an opportunity
for questions not usually asked
in litcr:iture....what assumptions
are made in literature about
women, how accurately is the
characterization drawn, is the

woman portrayed as a whole or
as part of a man? Do male as
opposed to female writers treat
women differently?

There are over 460 students
registered in courses now desig-
nated as Women's Studies. Yet,
comparitively there are few
women involved with the various

wom en's groups. Daims.
Sklepowich, and Hahner .all
agreed that a connection

between the Women’s Studies
and the Women's Movement
may not be valid.

Daims said that students have
come after class to express their
involvement in Women's Libera-
tion but that there is no effort
to do Consciouspess Raising in
class. “Some students," she said,
“take my Course because they
might. want to approach litera-
ture in another way.”

Sklepowich commented that
most of her students fall into
one of two categories. Either
they are very committed to
Women's Liberation and take
the course because of a “high
degree of personal involvement”
or they do not see themselves as
part of the Movement. These
students in the latter category
are, according to Sklepowich,
perhaps even afraid or turned off
but they are curious.

Although the Women's Move»
ment is varied and active, it is
still small when one considers
the number of female students
attending SUNYA. Various rea»
sons were proposed to explain
this. Sherry Sussman felt that
“people don‘t feel that Women‘s
Liberation is something to be
attended." MaryAnn 'I‘opccek
explained that some women are
turned off because the groups
are not political or radical
enough.

MaryAnn summed up the
feeling of the movement:
“People must be concerned.
People want things to happen
but they just don't movr-
Nolliing is going to be handed to
women. it has he demanded."

Mock Senate Planned

The 23rd Annual New York
State Intercollegiate Mock Sen-
ate Session is set for March 28th
through April 1st. The Mock
Senate in the past as will be in
the future is a viable source in
setting a proximity among New
York State colleges and univer-
sities. With this different
approach to youth in govern-
ment, a convergence and closer
contiguity exists between the
students and the administration
which they represent.

During the five days of Mock
Senate, only three days will be
used for the actual session. On

Friday, the Assembly Chambers
will be the location for the
session of the Mock Senate. If
time allows, an invocation by
the Speaker of the Assembly,
Perry Duryea, will be given in
the installation of the President
of Mock Senate. This function
will be at 9:00 a.m. on Friday,
March 30th.

At the first meeting of Lhr:
Mock Senate Delegations, llll'
Mayor of Albany, Erastus Cor-
ning, will give his annual speech.
This will take place at the Shem
ton Inn Towne Motor Inn, 300
Broadway: 7:00 pm, WCdni's-
day, March 28th.

Whatever John Lindsay's
motives, political or mental were
for retiring from a post that he
held for nearly eight years, he
has caused fissure in New York
City.

Out of seVeral of the names
entered in the miiyorality race,
four stand out as being top
contenders. Nevertheless credit
should be given to all those who
hch seriously considered the
idea of seeking one of the most
unwanted positions in the politi»
cal realm.

Representative Mario Biaggi is
one of the strongest contenders
in the race. He is a man with
many credentials in his back
ground, and as in the past, is
campaigning on the law and or
der theme. Decorated many
times in his role as a police
lieutenant, Mario Biaggi seems to
reﬂect many of the character.

to stop dragnct detentions and

“groundless suspicionsihat the
people detained are living in the

Horsemeot

(ZNS)--Customers in Portland,
Oregon, have shut down the
city's only horscmcat store.

The reason for the closing of
lllt‘ J & H Markcl was not a
protest, however. It was simply ii
deluge of customers desperately
trying to buy litil‘bt’ml’iil'— more
i-usloniers than the small market
could handle.

It all started when d l’oi'llzind
nl'wapupci‘ i‘vcl'ntly I‘L’pnl'lEd
that an Uri-gun woman had been
svi'vmg lll‘l' husband horsemcat
for thc pilbl three years, without

.l & l'l Murkrt. lid Carroll, said
that the artich- apparently infor-
mud hundreds of potential
customers in Portland that
horsi-iiii-at was available at prices
much cheaper than those of
beef.

The result was lilies of people
ill the door, and not enough
Inl'ill to go around. Carroll has
llt't'li form-d to close his market
until lTI' can locate a large 4‘-
nough supply of horse steaks
and horse ribs to feed his new
i‘ilsliinici‘s.
