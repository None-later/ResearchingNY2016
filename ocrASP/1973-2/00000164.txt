A Music ,fOr People

by Andy Palley

There is a strange irony in the
arts. When a ﬁlm premiers at a
Broadway theater, it can im-
mediater , or almost immedi-
ately. judged either a master-
piece or a failure. When Marc
Chagall paints another protrait,
thousands of people bite their
nails to keep from spending their
inheritance to buy it. But when
a composer of “classical” writes
a long-awaited string quartet. it
migltt take years before the
musical world sees what is
behind the notes,

Composers have learned to
accept this state as normal. and.
in fact. have decided that it is an
unusual turn when a work is
understood soon after its
writing. Elliot Carter. one of
America‘s very great composers.
spent last weekend here at
SUNYA listening to superior
performances of some of his
greatest works. and saw that his
time was beginning to come.
Though performances ofCarter‘s
work are still rare (due possibly
to the extraordinary difficulty
of the music). their increasing
number points toward entrance
into the “standard repertory“ of
classical musicnan unjust system
perpetrated by economic necess-
ity.

The difference between most
modern instrumental music and
Elliott Carter's music is a human
one. Carter's music is poetic.
bated in human existence. At
times it can be harsh and cruel
(as in his I’ulitzer-I’rize-Winning
String Quartet No. 2). or lyric
and ﬂowing (as in his amazing

Piano Sonata). There is never
one side to a true master, and so
it is here. Although a composer
eventually communicates with
far more people than the aver-
age, working- class slob. oiie's
foibles are really no greater or
lesser than the other‘s. And
anyone who pretends they are
will probably overstate tlieni-
selves into oblivion.

Carter's music is most oft des-
cribed as being turgid. thick. and
incomprehensible to the listener.
Not to make and obvious corti-
parisoii. but Brahams‘ music was
equally incomprehenstble to his
public. The fact that the four
members of a string quartet
could play four dissimilar lines
at any one time does not mean
that all four are not discernabel.
Il'i Carter‘s First String Quartet,
the opening fantasia contains a
number of sections where every-
one cultivates their own gardens.
If the playing is right (and the
Composers String Quartet
played it better than almost any-
one eould). the effect grows
upon the listener in an unusual
way. One feels that one is
becoming a good friend of all
the instruments and their diff-
erent cries and laments. It is new
ground broken perhaps by
Bartok in his six string quartets.

When Carter is riot provrdiiig
variety in this way. he finds
other ways. Themes are iiitio-
duced. repeated almost culirilil-
cally on different instruments.
and then mysteriously die away,
They might return or they might
not. Or. as in the Summi on.”

Mr. Carter (who. at ()5. is a
Burgess Meredith lookalike) has
seen much come and go in his
lifetime. He is qurte outspoken
about his likes and dislikes in
music, As one might expect. he
leans toward the subtle and the
philosophically human com-
posers. Aaron (‘opland's early
works interest him greatly. hirt

As far as iiidiVidual peilor-

laud the Dorian Woodwind

Williams for a fine job on
Carter‘s Tympani pieces; and the

Quartest is must listening. It‘s
indeed a shame that I can‘t
describe these performances fur

day for that. I‘m sure.
