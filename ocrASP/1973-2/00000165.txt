Saturday, March 17th marked
Albany's Synchronized Swims
ming Club’s fourth, lat place
win in Eastern Intercollegiate
Synchronized Swimming Con-
ference (EISSC) competition.
This was the first victory for
Albany in routine competition,
which was held at the University
of New Hampshire. Albany had
won stunt competition for three
consecutive years.

The contest for first prize was
hard fought as twelve schools,
including the Universities of
Vermont, New Hampshire,
Maryland, and Buffalo and the
colleges of Geneseo and Brock-
port. battled to win the most
team points. The trophy will be
added to their display case col-
lection along with five medals,
won each time a routine placed
first, second, or third.

Albany competed in every
event, except one, with every
routine bringing in points. In the
beginner category, large groups
was won by “Queen of Hearts",
performed by Paula Norton,
Sharon O'Connor, Molly
Schmid, Holly Sherman, and
Joanne Trabold with Sharon and
Paula, “Snow White and Rose
Red", winning the bronze medal
in small groups. ,

“Ugly Duckling" with Sylvia
Case, Ruth Everett, Peggy
Dalheim, Bev Schmidt, and Don
Frament, took large group inter-
mediates; with Bev and Ruth, in
“Pop Goes the Weasel” placing
5th and Dave Amell and Sylvia,
as “Hansel and Gretel" coming
in 7th in duets.

To make Albany‘s sweep of
large group events complete, the

the bullpen, but only Bolin was
consistent last year on a team
which totalled only 25 saves.

The outfield is solid, even with
a mediocre Yaztremski. Reggie
Smith, certainly one of the most
underrated players around, will
be in right field, with another
good all around player, Tommy
Harper, in center.

The infield is strong on the left
side, with Rico Petrocelli at
Third, Aparicio at shortstop, and
Doug Griffin at second base. At
first base, the Red Sox are trying

to'pass with Cecil Cooper, a
rookie who is highly rated, but a
contender should not be
counting on rookies.

After that, the Red Sox have
no one, so they may very well
lack the depth to stay in a long
race. Either way, no Yaz means
no pennant contender, but "You
never know in Fenway'hsjust
ask Bill White.

After a decade of mediocrity,
the Cleveland Indians have
finally admitted that they need
to embark on a major rebuilding
program. One wonders what
took them so long. Onc also

Synchronized Swimming has
not come to an end yet this
year, however, for the team is

wonders why their rebuilding
program called for trading away
three of their five real major
Ieaguers: Graig Nettles (28 years
old), Phil chnigan (28 years
old), and Ray Fosse (26 years
old). Certainly these players
haVc at least seven or eight good
seasons ahead of them. Oh-
viously, they must think that the
players they receiVed (Charlie
Spikes, Rusty Torres, Jerry
Kenny, John Ellis, Brent Strom,
and a host of other youngers,
and an oldster, DaVc Duncan-~28
years old--— have a real future,
and if they do not, boy will
thosc fans in Cleveland scream.

Speaking. of Cleveland fans,
they are the ones who come
disguised as empty seats, usually
about 70,000 of them. Perhaps
if they were more noticeable,
the team could haVc afforded to
pay some better players and
prospects, but...

On March 2 and 3 the

season with a trip to the
N.Y.S.A.I.A.W. Championships
held at Oneonta. Taking the four
women who qualified, Albany
bested all its past performances
at the States by ﬁnishing six-

teams.
Highlights included Shelly

and Steve Dunning. The Indians
are even talking about using a
reject from the Mets, Brent
Strom, as a starter. If you can-
not break the Mets' starting rota-
tion, your ability is question-
able. Phil Henningan, the Indians
oniy decent reliever, went to the
Mets for Strom, so the word to
Cleveland fans is that: there is
no relief.

Ray Fossc went to Oakland for
Dave Duncan, a fair cathCer, but
in no way a good deal for the all
star Fosse is. John Ellis, once a
"Lum‘~cring Load" in the big
ballpark in the Bronx, will haVe
more room to spread out in, in
Municiple Stadium, and may
Very well beat out Duncan for
the catclicr'sjob. Chris Chamhliss
is at first base, a fairly good
hitter. The rest of the infield is
up for grabs between such super-
stars as Jcrry Kcnncy, Jack
Brohumer, Frank Duffy, and
Dave Bell, all uncertain quanti-
ties, to say the least. None of
them can be expected to fill the
void which thtlcs left.

The outfit-Id will be a big
question mark. If the young

Talk about strengths on this
team, and the first stop is third
base, where the “Human Vac-

everything in sight. Brooks
Robinson is 35, and will sooner
or later have to begin to feel his
age. At shortstop is the weak

good glove, one season a good
stick. Bobby Grich will fill the
spot left by Johnson, and will
turn in another fine perfor-
mance. At first base will eventu-

rough '72, going 13-16, but he
should be good for another 15
wins. Alexander is the unknown
quantity who can make or break
the starting rotation, and may
very well carry the Oriole’s pen-
nant hopes on his shoulders.
Last season he boasted a 2.45
ERA as a fifth starter and long
reliever, and he is highly rated
by many. The Oriole bullpen
will be weak, with only Ed Watt
having a decent '72, and no
improvement in sight.

The Orioles gave up too much
to get Williams. They no longer
have the depth that made them
pennant winners, and will have
trouble keeping up with the
Yankees, Detroit, and possibly
Boston.

The Boston Red Sox's chances
can be summed up in one name:
Carl Yaztremski. If Yiiz returns
to his old form which has been
noticeably absent for two
straight years, then the Bostons
will be troublemakers. If not...
there are always the Bruins and
Celtics.
