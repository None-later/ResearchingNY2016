This Could Be The Year of The Yankees

by Nathan Salant

Yes, baseball fans, this is the
year of the Yankees! That old
winning way has returned to the
Bronx, courtesy of such young
stars as Bobby Murcer and Graig
Nettles, established pitchers like
Mel Stottlemyre and Sparky
Lyle, a hot, new but in Matty
Atou, the Yankee management,
and a host of others.

This year marks the fiftieth
anniversary of Yankee Stadiuml
and this season may well mark
the start of another fifty years
of glory. Gone are the names of
Ruth, Gehrig, Dimiiggio, and
Mantle, but in their places will
be a new breed of stars.

Joe D. is no longer centerfield,
but in his place is one of the
youngest superstars in baseball.
Bobby Murcer got his 100 grand,
and is ready to follow in the
footsteps of his illustrious pred-
ecessors. Last season, Bobby hit
.292, with 33 HR's. 96 RBl's,
and led the league in runs scor-
ed, Look for Bobby, who was
under .200 for the first two
months of last season, to hit a
solid .lilU, with all of the other
stats rising, thanks to a vastly
improved Yankee offensive line-
up.
Hank Bauer no longer patrols
left field, but in his place is Roy
White, a solid ballpliiyer. Despite
an off year in ‘72, in which he
only hit .272 witli 54 RBl's and
10 HR's, Roy will be out there
on opening day. This s -on ltoy
will no longer be forced to play
the power hitter, ii role which he
was pressed into out of access
ity, and one which is not natural
for him. ltoy Will be batting
second, and Will be able to do
the things he docs so well go
with the pitch, hunt. and bit and
run The aVi-riige Will l)l' back up
at .290 where it usually is, and
he may cvvn brI-ak Iltltl People
have been knocking ltoy's Weak

arm for years, but when he hits
.300 and the Yankees go all the
way, no one will notice it.

Joining White and Murcer will
be: not Tommy Henrich, but ii
suitable replacement, Matty
Alou. Matty came to the Yan-
kees for Gardner and McKinney,
after hitting .314 last season,
and the Yankees are counting on
him to resume his momentarily
broken string of 180 hits per
season. At 33, Matty is by no
means over the hill, and can be
counted on for at least 5 more
seasons of fine play, barring in-
juries.

Johnny Mize is back home (in
the farm, but the Yankees pulled
a Mize out of the over the hill
gang when they obtained
Johnny Callison last season. Cats
lisoii went out and hit .250, with
9 HR's and 34 [{Bl's, not bud
for dead wood. Callison will see
lots of the DH role, and will
come on for Alon in the late
innings to get his shotgun arm in
for defense. Ron Swohoda will
see lots of lefties this season, and
he claims to have his old “it
swing back. He may be right
since he is leading the Grapefruit
league in l baggers.

The days of the late lted
Rolfe, and more recently ()leti-
Boyer, are gone, but last season
the Yankees come on strong
after bringing up Uelerino San-
che'L to play lliird base. (,lelcrino
did a fine job, but has since seen
his Job taken away by the arrival
of (iriilg Nettles from thc ln
tliiiiii. Nettles is a golden glovv iii

and .is the [ill

At shortstop, Phil Rizzuto no
longer reigns, but the veteran
Gene Michael is there, a fine
fielder who is ironically nick-
named “the Stick"---something
he has never used effectively.

Gene was always losing his job in
the spring to the likes of Reuben
Amara and Frank Baker, hot by
May, he was planted at the hole
between second and third. This
year Gene is the shortstop no
matter what, and he may be
encouraged by this new trust in
him to improve on his .233
average and 32 RBl‘s. Backing
him up will be Hal Lanier,
another Veteran, another fine
fielder, and another zero at the
plate.

Unfortunately, Bobby ltich-
ardson no longer plays second
base, nor does be lead off, and in
his place is the much maligned
llorace Clarke, [for years, Clarke
Wiis known as the worst pivot
man in the league, and the cry of
"Clarke S--ks" often filled the
air as he dazzled the fans With
his circus act at second base. He
would do It till'“l.lil't>W wild to
the :5 fans in the upper (leek, trip
over second base, etc. Then,
suddenly, things changed. llor-
ace matured last season, led the
major leagues in turning the Dl’,

and the fans began cheering. No
way he Will ri-vr-rt to his old,
useless form, and he will im-
prove on that .‘J/ll avuriign.

At first base, lton liloinbcrg

llcliiiid the plate is the ncw llill
lllt'lU') , 'l'buriiian Morison Mun

son swatted a solid .280 last
year, and can be expected to
have a better year at the plate,
thanks to the abundance of
lefties the Yankees will see. His
back up will be either weak
fielding Jerry Moses, or the
promising, non roster player,
Rick Dempsey.

Did you know that Mel Stot-
tlemyre ranks among the all time
Yankee pitchers in almost every
category? Among his more not-
able stats are his Mil lifetime
wins, all but 9 with nonconten-
ders, and all in the space of 8+
seasons, Another sign of his class
is his 40 career shutouts, second
on the Yankee all time list, anti
first in the AL. This year, with
better fielding for Mel, he is a
lock to win 20,

Backing up Stottlemyre are
Fritz Peterson, Steve Kline, Mike
Kekich, and a host of others.
Fritz has established himself as a
solid starter, and will probably
hit. for 20 wins. lf Kline resumes
where he left off last August, he
will also reach the 20 win pla-
teau. Kekich is the least reliable
of the starters, but he is also the
youngest and has grcat |ltllt'lll.liil.
lf Mike can survive the first
inning, pitch some more l‘tiln‘
plete games, and live through the
hell of his personal problems, lll‘
may come out with shining
colors iind Win 17 games. If not.
he may find himself in the bull
pen.

Now we come to thc Yiink's
only l’I‘iIl problem. middle relief
and a fifth starter. Last season,
thc Yankee bullpen was a parade
of clowns who could be counted
on to iiiiikc sure that a team
would not hold their lead against
the Yanks, but. would insure thiil.

important changes, all for the

year in the RR. League this past
winter, and with his new Albany
State based fan CIUb, will be a
lock to make the team and really
contribute something. Blasing
ame has done very well in spring
training, as have rookies Jim
Magnuson and George Medicli.
Mcdich is a good bet to come

may he the fifth starter, while
Magnuson battles, fellow rookie

last spot (in the staff. Casey Cox

set with l'lunibugger‘s recent

students at his office that “I can
only respect ii teacher if he or
she has hiid iit least one scholarly
work published and if [hey are
