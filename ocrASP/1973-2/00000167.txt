by AS. Nyne

Central Council met last Thursr
day iii the laundry room of
Waterbriry Hall in an effort to
get "closer to the people," On
the agettda were thirty-seven
bills dealing with strikes. appro-
priations. white ballots. and im-
pcaehnients.

Council Chairperson Canned
I'Ioklttii introduced eight bills
calling for the impeachment of
President Lurupit. Lumpii irri-
rtiediately castigated I’Iokum for
"precipitating ingenuotrs dissert-
troii for his own personal rrrr
brttgarieous satisfaction." Debate
on the bill cotttiriued for twenty
mtritites until Acting Chairman
“Pack” Current informed
llokum tltat his motions had
died for lack of a second, sirice
the Official Seconder, Maryjurre
Buttons, was absent from the

meeting securing refreshments
from the snack bar, which was
uptown.

Radical sniokesmaii Bury Davis
introduced a bill appropriating
the ASP salaries lirie to the My
Lat Veterinary Center. While all
agreed that the hospital needed
rebuilding, sentiment reflected
the statement of liberal spokes-
person Micki Gotbucks that the
involved animals “should put!
themselves up by their boot-
straps.“ and she moved to
amend the motion to send $50
from the Central Council re-
freshments litre instead,

A second-degree amendment
was offered by Finance Chair-
person Steel Girder which appro-
priated all $5.000 remaining in
the refreshments Itrie. “Enough
is too much." exclaimed Vice-
Chairperson Current, who
moved to refertlie matter to the

Ad Hoc Committee on Washer-

was seconded by Radio Council-
person WSUAve Golightly,
which set off a minor 30-minute
dispute over whether or not any
of the other motions had been
seconded.

Several residents of the dormi-
tory appeared iii the room to
retrieve their laundry and were
dragooiied into joining a Central
Council Committee on Laundry
Soaps.

While the Chairman and Vice-
Chatrman consulted Hoyle‘s
Rules for Games for guidance
about what to do next. a verbal
battle arose among three conn-
cilpeople over who should pay
the extra penny tax on the bag
of potato clitps.
