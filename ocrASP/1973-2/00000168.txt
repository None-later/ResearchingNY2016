Associated Premise

Administration members all
OVer the nation have taken OVer
the student unions in what
appears to be the largest out-
pouring of unrest since the Cam-
bodia invasion. As of this morn-
ing more than 400 colleges and
universities remain closed with
the number increasing every
hour. The rioting is in response
to what administrations feel is
growing student encroachment.
What sparked the mass closing of
schools was attributed to the
deaths of four college deans at
Bent State University. and the
shooting by student security of
two black vice— presidents at
George Rockwell University.

Chanting slogans like “2, 4, 6,
8, all you students masterbate,"
and burning transcripts, adminis-
tration members are upset over
student apathy and student in-
t ' One ‘

' ‘ ntinn

spokesman at Princeton, who
wished to remain anonymous
said. “God damn it, those F---en
students are so freakish, we can ‘t
even talk to them with all that
loud music blasting."

The National Guard was called
out last night on the University
of Maryland. when about 100
administrators gathered on
“Route One. overturning student
registered cars, and breaking
dorm windows. The head of the
Maryland Guard has ordered a 9
to 5 curfew for all administra-
tors who must now remain in
their ofﬁces till they leave.

Students have by and large
remained fairly apathetic to the
recent uproar. One coed at
UCLA was quoted as saying,
"Now that the Spring is here,
they just don't want to stay in
their cubicles. It's more fun to
riot. I remember when l was
younger, we used to do the same

i' A

Ballbany State

President Louie Ben-gay-zet
and Vice-President Crockin led
several administrators to the
Campus Center where they
assembled to hear a speech by
Mayor Eruthmus Mourning. The
Mayor, speaking from the CC
fountains told the crowd that
“we administrators have been
too long held responsible for too
much. It’s time they learn that if
we got something to say, we‘re
gonna say it now."

Student Association President
Michell Lumpot and his asso-
ciate Tom ClingsOn were reporv
tedly disturbed by Ballbany
State Administrators. Mike, in a
rare interview with the Kick IN
the Asp told this reporter.
"Frankly, I'm surprised, this 1‘“
ﬂeets a primigenous recension ol'
ribald shandrydan, and is basic
ally ultimogeniture ophiomanr'y.
besides whichI it's a fucking
shame."

To the Editor:

Let me state first that this letter IS not
for publication Under no circumstances,
do I want to be stabbed in the back again.
Everytiine I turn around another so-called
"reporter" front the ASP is there to
misquote me on another polysyllable
expression of solidarity with the ruling
clique on this campus.

Yes. I love power. Yes. I love polish.
Yes, I love the soft black leather couches
that abound in administrative offices,
Someday I hope to be an llllllillllﬁlriiltir
myself. and when llurl day corrrcs. I
intend never to talk to any of you again

For that matter, I don't think I‘ll talk
to any of you starting right now. As I‘ve

Sick(sic)

To the Editor:

I would like to make one think per-
fectly clear: The ASP’s constant useage of
the term “infirmary” is both incorrect
and misleading. The proper term when
referring to the student health service is
the Student Health Service.

The word “infirmary” implies sickness.
No one is “sick” who enters the doors of
the Student Health Service-only “un-
well." And it is equally implicatory that
the word means that infirm people work
in the Student Health Service. That is
simply a dirty rumor.

I wrin the ASP would cease these
rrrcsporisrblc mistakes of jargon. I also
mall the ASP would stop writing about
ilrc Student Health Center, which in my
opinion, is beyond comment. I also wish
the ASP woiild...wcl|. that's another story
and I'm terribly busy.

The Truth Lies
To the Editor:

I am damn sick and tired of Wading
truth. Every time that I pick up
the ASP I only get the bare facts. Have
none of you any idea of even the most
basic tenets ofjournalism?

Don't you realize you must stop your
outrageous distortions of news events,
and fabricate news events completely? As
long as anything in the ASP cven re-
motely corresponds to reality, you might
just as well tell the whole truth instead of
the tiny kcrnal of it you presently dole
out to your readers.

As il stands now, people complain the
ASP niisqllolcs them. Don't you realize if
