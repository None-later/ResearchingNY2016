Myer case:

= I Credentials, Teac

by Glenn von Nostitz
News Analysis

Dr. Yasli l’. Myer has some
c\cellerrt credentials. Ari As-
sc .rte Professor of Chemistry
here for the past fotrr years. he
has \rr‘rtten triariy highly im-
pressive articles for significant
journals. has received top honors
from iriiportarit people in his
field. and has beeti or will be an
invited speaker at several major
conferences.

Brit try as Ire may. Dr. Myer
has yet to be promoted to the
position of full professor. Three
times he has gone through the
promotion machine. and three
times he has been rejected,

This is not another tcnrire case.
Myer already has terirrre. wlrrch
he received back in roux, Before
that. he taught at Yale. So the
much discussed "tenure
squee/c". tn which too many
professors are vying for too few
tenure positions. is irrelevant in
this case. For better or lot
worse. Yasli Myer is staying here

at Albany. There is little the

University can do about that.

Perhaps that is the reason it
has been a relatively quiet case.
attracting little attention from
anyone outside the Chemistry
Department. except for a few
deans and committee chairmen.
Brit that does not mean it is air
unimportant case. Any case that
helps explain the functionings of
the often mysterious tenure
machine can be called irri-
portant.

The machine rutis smoothly,
even effortlessly. Some call it
impersonal. others say it is
necessary. In Dr. Myer's View. it
is unfair.

Low Ratings

While his academic UfCthllllul':
may be impeccable. Mycr's en-
tire record as an Associate I’ro-
lessor is certainly not wrtlrorrt
blemish. There are the low stri-
derrt ratings he received back in
the Spring of WW). Ills under-
rraduate students gave him only

a 2.13 on a scale of 5, iii which 5
is "excellent". In the Spring of
I97], his rating was even lower.
only a 2.07.

The low ratings Irave been
seized upon by tneri like I.
Moyer Hunsbergcr, Deaii of the
College of Arts and Sciences.
and Malcolm Smiley, former
Associate Deatt for Science and
Mathematics, as reasons to deny
Myer the promotion. a promo-
tion that would mean a corr-
siderably increased salary and
tnore prestige.

The most recent student
ratings have improved sortie-
what. grving him a 3.44 in the
Spring of l‘l72. But to the
numerous deans and councils.
this still wasn‘t high enough.

What has been surprising is
that many of Myer‘s students
hrvc agreed wrtlr the deans and
councils. It is surprising because
in most ierrure and promotion
cases. the students and decision
makers are usually at opposite
extremes.

On the other hand, it is not so
surprising. because the dislike;
for Myer’s teaching methods
appears generally widespread, iri-
cluding botlr students and his
colleagues.

Professor Myer blames his poor
ieaclririg ratings on the unpopu.
lar stand he took on controver-
sial issues a few years ago. He
was against S-U grading from its
very beginning. and says he still
opposes it today.

He is also very demanding of
his students. another factor
which may account for his low
ratings. Additionally. Myer says
the subject ritatter, physical
chemistry. is dry no matter who
teaches it.

Finally. the figures cited by
the administrators were pro—
duced errtrrely by under-
graduates. Myer says he does
rrrriclr better among his graduate
students.

But the men who make the
promotion and tenure decisions
don't see this. or simply don‘t
believe the chemistry professor.
so he continues to be turned
down for promotion.

Mayor Of

by David Duriaway

Oakland, Ca.AFS A Will
Bobby Settle be the next mayor
of Oakland and Elaine Brown
the first woman on the Oakland
City Council? It is more than a
possibility, as the campaign pulls
into its fourth month for the
April l7 elections.

The chairman of the Black
Panther Party has been waging
an effective and tightly organ
ized campaign for mayor burs-ed
on the principle of returning
Oakland's wealth to the prior
and oppressed communities, and
reorganizing city priorities. Scale
proposes to raise some ten mil
lion dollars by increasing city
service charges and business
taxes, cutting emergency riot
funds, sharing, and
increasing taxes on the giant,
semi-public,l’ort of Oakland.

With this wealth he proposes
to futid u whole-range of social
survrces, such as jolrtraining,
increased personnel at public
schools ritid hospitals, and
building more low-incomi- public

Oakland

The Panther‘s blueprint for
change has been curer'uny
worked out to re-ordcr the city '5
priorities along the line of
serving the "people", which iii
this case means the many ethnic
groups of this city of 400,000 “
Asians, Blacks, Chicanos, and
Whites. it is a “grass-roots" cam-
paign that draws heavily on
neighborhood support on the
precinct level.

As long-time residents, both
Scale and Brown are familiar to
the Black community of
Oakland. Through the Black
Panther Party, many or Seale's
ideas have already been enacted,

although on a much urn-liar
scale. The Panthers nowoponaor
several free clinics and free
breakfast program- as well,” an
escort service for the elderly (of
all races) to protect them form
muggers.

The crucial factor in Seale's
plans is the wealth that can be
garnered from Oakland's munici-
pal income. If this falls short, as
some of his three oponents have
suggested, all the social program
may dry up as well. Already,
(resident Nixon’s actions in cur-
tailing the Office of Economic
Opportunity and other programs
have most the city of Oakland
some ten million dollars in'anti--
poverty funds. 0n the other
hand, even without additional
revenue, some changes can be
made. Seale would probably
decrease civic spending on such
projects as the luxurious down-
town Oakland plaza which is
now costing the city millions of
dollars while it effectively
decreases 'thenumber of lower
income housing units.

The present mayor, John
Reading, has advocated the
trickle-down theory of spending:
increase business tax writeoffs
and subsidies and the money will
triekly down to everyone.
Unfortunately, during the seven
years of the Reading administrate
tion the unemployment rate for
Oakland has increased 3%.

The Scale program is essential-
ly an application of the program
of the Black Panther Party to
electoral politics. Why has the
Party chosen this route to social
change? Huey Newton and
others in the Party have
suggested that the original con»
frontation politics of the sixties
were no longer appropriate,- to
their goals. Instead, they have
been trying to rctrench and in
the past year have been concen-
trating on building up a solid
local liaise of support in the
Black community.

If any Panther candidate is
going to take the actual reign of
power here in Oaklaiitl it will be
Bobby Seulc. This is where the
Panthers were started and where
they are heist known A" their own
community. Bobby Scale and
Elaine 'Brown are focusing on
registering 50,000 new voters in
Oakland, mostly in the Black
and Chicano communities. That
way, even if they should lose in
April, they will haVe built. up a
grassroots organization for the
future. Will there be a “people’s
earthquake" in Oakland‘.’ Listen
for it in two short months.

 

by Duval Snowden
ASP legislative Correspondent

Although people are being shot
in the United States everyday,
no one takes notice until a pub-
lic ﬁgure is gunned down and
fatally wounded or killed. Peo~
ple took notice when they heard
the echos across the country
about the shooting of Senator
Kennedy. They took notice of
the more recent shooting of Sen-
ator John Stennis of Mississippi.

By now, one would think that
somewhere between assassina-
tions and murder attempt:
meaningful progress would have
been made to stiffen gun con-
trol. The truth is, serious meth-
ods have been taken to curtail
the sale of these guns which are
primarily used in assaults. For
example, the 1968 Gun Control
Act restricted the mail order sale
of guns. It also required registra-
tion of purchasers of guns and
ammunition and upon such pur-
chase, identification and proof
of age.

In New York City, the pur
chaser of a handgun must be
fingerprinted, photographed,
pay a registry fee and produce
two character references. Along
with this, the buyer must show a
valid need for the use of such a
weapon.

Even though strict require-
ments are attached when at-
tempting to purchase handguns,
still 51% of the murders, accord-
ing to the National Commission
on the Causes and Prevention of
Violence, are committed by
handguns. The “Saturday Night
Specials" have shown an increase
of 2.5 million in sales.

One of the long time advocates
of tighter regulations on small
firearms has been Senator
Joseph L. Galiber (Bronx, 32nd
District). This year the Senator

 

SENATOR CALIBER

has introduced legislation which
would take gun control a couple
of steps further. If the bill is
passed it would put a total ban
on the manufacture or merchan-
dising of 25 caliber weapons of
arty description, 22 caliber auto‘
maties and 22 caliber revolvers
with harmls less than four
inches. The bill would also give
stipulation as to the advertise-
ment of any of those types of
guns manufactured out of state.

Galiber seems to realize that
for any effective measures to be
done concerning gun control,
legislation must not only be en-
acted, but carried out to its full
intent and purpose. Not like the
Gun Control act which has been
drilled with loopholes and leaves
gun purchasing laws up to the
localities. Though it is true of
good strong rules in New York
City, once outside of Manhattan,
jurisdiction and prudence take a
new turn.
