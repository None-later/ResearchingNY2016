Once a year, our administra-
tion makes a public display of
rewarding excellence in teaching
by granting a few Outstanding
Teacher Awards. This event usu'
ally takes place in the spring
after many excellent teachers
have already had their contracts
non-renewed. I‘m sure that the
majority of SUNYA students
view these awards at best as
tokenism. However, some inter
esting details of the awards pro-
cedures have just come to my
'attention which indicate that the
tokens to be selected will not
necessarily be those who were
m0st highly evaluated by the
students

Everyone in my department
has recently received the follow-
ing memo from Dr. Teevan: “Dr.
Waterman is in the final consid~
eration for a teaching award.
The committee invites each fac-
ulty member of the Psychology
Department to send his or her
ideas and comments on this to"
the chairperson of the awards
selection committee

SinCe faculty members rarely
observe each other teach, it
would seem appropriate to ques-
tion how they can evaluate a
professor‘s teaching effective
rims incl: my teaching has at
ready lJl‘t'tl evaluated this year
by colleagues who lll'thr aili-iid

 

ed my classes, i can provide you
with some illustrations of how
this is done. Dr. Tedeschi rated
me “highly as a teacher of un<
dergraduate students," but
pointed out that my “lack of
maturity in interpersonal rela-
tions would not lead to the
prediction that she would per-
form at the same level with
graduate students." The sup-
plementary letter of transmittal
included a statement from an
unidentiﬁed faculty member
about u “fiasco” that he “would
envision."

i am not concerned that pre-
dictions and visions like the
above will be taken seriously by
the selection committee. (The
statements appear to have made
little impression on Dean Bers,
Dean Hunsbcrger, President
Benezet, and the majority of
members of the Faculty Personv
nel Committee and University
Council.) However, even if “evi-
dence" of this nature is totally
disregarded hy the selection
committee, ii is obvrous that a
finalist who has the active sup-
port of his or her department
has an advantage over those of
us whose coll‘agues View us as
“poor citizens" and “divisive in-
fluences '

In addition to soliciting inlor
matron lroin finalists' colleagues,
the selection t'omniillcc has also

requested information from the
ﬁnalists themselves. Speciﬁcally,
we were asked to “read and
respond to" a number of criteria
outlined in the Chancellor's
Guidelines for “Awards for Ex-
cellence in Teaching." It is only
fair for me to point out that
many, but not all, of the criteria
listed in this document appear to
be quite reasonable However. 1
view the ﬁnalists‘ self-evalua-
tions regarding those criteria as
irrelevant. The Outstanding
Teacher Awards should not be
turned into an essay writing can
twt on Why l Am a Good
Teacher. 1 would like to be
judged on what i actually do in
the classroom, not on what i
Claim to do, Furthermore, even
if i were able to accurately
report my classroom behavior, it
is the imput'l uflhix behavior on
my SIllL/L’IIIS' that is of para-
mount importance, not the opin~
ions of the selection committee
about this behavior.

While student evaluations were
evidently the determining factor
in the selection of ihc finalists, it
is clear that selfcvaluations and
department support Will he lm*
portant variables iii the selection
of llll‘ wrnni-rs 'I‘lii‘reforc, the
teaching awards competition is
at least partially an essay writing
contest and partially a depart
mental slilltliirll) contest

Oscar Goes To Wounded Knee

by Duval Snowden

Two years ago a man an-
nounced to the press that he
would not accept the Oscar for
best actor of the year. Many
criticisms were delivered and
laden upon George C. Scott that
year. However, his convictions
were firm. He had decided not
to accept the Oscar because he
believed that the reward system
of theatre was not a correct one.

Tuesday night marked a rerun
of those actions, as Marlon Bran-
do, chosen as the best actor for
his role as the Godfather, de-
clined the award on the basis of
the actions taken by the United
States towards American Indi-
ans. A representative of the Na-
tive Americans Afﬁrmative Im-
mage Committee, Sacheen Lit-
tlefeather gave the message to
the audience is or i should say
crowd. The beautiful Apache ln-
dian said that “Mr. Brando re-
gretfully cannot accept the
award because of the treatment
of American Indians in this
country."

The crowd, caught by surprise,
gave off some vocal hostilities.
later to be drowned out by
applause. The majority seemed
inclined to applaud the famed
actor's courage for keeping in

mind the theatre's demeaning
interpretation of America‘s only
real natives. This refusal was aim
a direct reply to tlll‘ l'miod
States for the actions iiwi [1,.
