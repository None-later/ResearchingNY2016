Hesse: An Overview

by Mark Gilmonr

Hesse is easy reading. His prose
flows. The Bantam and Farrar-
Straus editions available in the
bookstore are phenomenal trans-
lations from the original Ger-
man. Hesse's problems-though
he wrote his last novel in
l943--are our problems. Reading
Hesse is not a Sophistic escape;
it‘s a digging into the hard real-
ities of life.

The Writer 'r for the Seven/[ex
Series edition on Hesse, also
available in the campus store,
deals with the symbolism and
import of his major works. It's
moderately well done, though it
hit tedious. It is advisable to
read the original works before
reading this commentary (Edwin
Casebcer, Warner PL, 1972).

Three years ago I met my firsl
Hesse l'reak in Genesco. l was
llllll‘ll‘l‘ll years old and a college
sophomore and I‘d iichr heard

commit suicide. Harry Haller
can‘t take life. He sees the ab-
surdity of his middle class, pam-
pered existence all too clearly;
he sees the insanity of their
wars, their overall ignorance of
themselves and each other. The
book makes you want to run
into the shower with a razor
yourself until you’re more than
half—way through; then Hesse
makes the steady climb back to
his justification for living. If
you’re considering suicide, read
Sreppenwolfc first. You may
change your mind. Don't read
It'lingi‘or'r Lasl Summer. You
may not; in Klingror the chilrnt‘~
ter neVer goes fur enough to
reason it iill out.

The (llasr [10ml (fame, para-
doxicnlly, was an indictment of
people who totally reject hour-
geoisic society. lf you‘re reading
Hesse for the l'iral. time, I suggest
yoii don‘t read this one first. it's
lhc hurdl'st of his works in read;
it comes off serious and lllltllOl‘l'
lalive, but it's really a satire on
the fulilily and ullimulc (loom

Contest Winners

Journey to the East is a
montage of Hexse's characters
marching away from the banal-
lty of Western "logic" toward
the aubllmlty of the East.

Narcissus and Goldmund is
perhaps Heaaa'a most enjoyable
and readable work. Apart from
the heavy symbolism-which you
can try to figure out in the
critical essays--Goldmund is a
baffling and enviable character.
He ﬁnds out how to make love
to fifty-five peasant girls--
without verbal foreplay and
without being chauvinistlc-‘and
he leaves them all happy.

Hesse drqu heavily on Freud
and Jung and Neitzsche as well
its the Eastern mystics. He con-
vincingly relates the subjectivity
of Eastern thought into the pat-
tern of our Western tradition,
though he goes so far as to
sayA-in Sfcl)[)€l1w0/f€--thal the
things about life that the East
has spent thousands of years
trying to learn the West has
spent those same thousands of
years trying to suppress. He
draws much of his symbolism
l'rom Freud and Jung (predom-
inimtly Narcissus and Goldmmid
and SIcppcnwo/fe and Damien).
Like Zarathustra, he cries out
against the bestiality of man.
He's always talking about going
home-through the dirt and the
humbug and the suffering and
the glory and the torment--
nevertheless: home.
