Bergman’s Trilo

by Kenn Rabin

This weekend, The Inter-
national Film Group is privileged
to show, for the first time in this
country, the complete, uncut,
and correctly sequenced Trilogi’
of C liamher Plays 0n Fair/l and
Religion by lngmar Bergman.
Through A Glass Darkly will be
shown Friday in LC-lS, Win/er
fig/II Saturday, and The Silence
(uncut for the first time) on
Sunday. All films will be shown
at both 7: l5 and 9:115 PM

The films form a logical pro
grcssion of faith, hope, doiihl,
and ultimate uncertainty alioiit a
world outside that of man. What
makes Bergman's search so en-
gaging, of course, is that il_ is
our search that is so poignantly
pi'oli‘ayed on the screen, lt is the
struggle we all share; the struggle
with ourselves, with each other,
Willi the abstract Bergman 's tal
ent lies in his ability to create a
metaphorical world, where the
abstract becomes physical, and
intensely personal--therefore,
Identifiable, able to be coped
with.

'l'lirnug/r .Al (r'laxi' I)arklr. thi-
first film, has becn subtitled by
Bergman, “Certainty achieved."

t

Sister and Brother in THROUGH A CLASS DARKLY

This is the first step towards
coping with the matters outside
the realm of the phystcal~the
first thing one must do is estab-
lish their existence. “God is
Love," is the message of this
first film (it is stated by one of
the characters at the end). ll is
the kind of love a father may
have for his son or daughter, a
husband may have for his wife,
or a brother may have for his
sister Minus, the young boy,
haying no communication With
his father whatsoever, is seeking
a guarantee, a sign that his father
is there. The parellels Bergman is
establishing are iihVious as
Minus seeks his father, and a
definition of love, we all seek
evidence of another Father, and
his r-alrn .if love, When, in the
last low of the film, Minus stops
in liewnderment, and says aloud,
"Daddy spoke to me!" he has
rel i-ived this awareness. If God is
Love, 'lll'll Minus‘ awareness of
his riiinrr‘s love, of the guidance

uni-sell i». an awareness of a type

PACE 6A

 

 

of God. The film, finally, is an
optimistic one: God is Love,
Love exists, therefore, God
exists. We need seeek no further.
Minus and his father, David, are
both concerned for Karin
(Minus' sister, David's daughter),
but David is upset bccuasc he
watches his daughter's terminal
illness in a Clinical manner. The
dichotomy between Father
watching sick (laughter with
love, and Father watching sick
daughter with Clinical eye is the
important one. if the Father in
the film is the falher in the
rcligiou. se, thcn how does he
watch us, his Clllltll‘Cltr‘Wllll love,
or clinically, as an experiment?
Could God be tortured in his
attitude towards us, even as
David is towards his daughter?
Divided between the emotional
and the scientific? Was the crea-
tion of Man and Life an act (if
Love, or an experiment? The
films asks these questions
through the rich, dark texture of
the photography of Sven Nye
quist, Nyiiuist has photographed
almost all of Bergman‘s films
with a consistency of excellence
that often goes unnoticed, but
should be emphasized. To my
mind, he and Von Sternbcrg's

   

 

int "he. . :

photographer, Lee Garmcs, are
the two greatest photographers
of black and white film. Each
can manipulate light and dark-
ness, depth not necessarily of
focus, burt rather of attention,
usint'. the finest shadiiigs of tone,
which look natural, but are
iarder lhaii hell to achieve

The "lteilucinin," as Bergman
calls it, from Metaphysical to
physical, lrom intangible lo iaii
gililc, continues Willi the second
film, WIN/cl [lg/ll This film,
.siihlitleil "certainly unmasked,”
is particularly slioi'l, darkly pas
toral (iii the tradition til the
early film of Victor .‘i’ostroiii
and Carl Dreyer), and relatively
simple. If l)aVii|, tlic l“ill.lll‘l in
'I'Iirougli rl ti‘lusi Hark/r (played
by Gunniir Bloriistrand) was the
main character of this second
film. The film examines his
doubt, us he fails to comfort a
suicidal man The Mtlll, played
by Max Von Sydow, commits
wicide despite the priest's
attempts to calm his fears about

 

 

 

 

‘i

      

the world situation. Feeling he
has failed, almost convinced
himself by the man's rationale,
'l'omas fathers a doubt which
grows. ll is a iloithl, perhaps
about the very i-\islcnec of (hid,
liiil it is lriggercd by the hick of
logic, of perfection, of orilcr and
sense lo the lliings 'l'omas is
aware of aroiiiiil him. He is a
coward, however, and niiisl con-
tinue to hide behind the chiiich
establishment (now wrlliiiul
I'ouiidalion in his mind), for he
hasn'l enough nerve to step otil.
from Ilic protective lllillll'xl‘l.
'l‘oinas tries to comfort the man
and his Wife.

“We fill" our simple daily Ines.
And lheii some terrible piece of
iiilorinalion fort-es itself into our
M‘L'llll‘, siifc \\tll'lll ll‘s llllll'l‘
lliaii We l'.ill hear The whole
slate of affiiiis is so ii\cr
wliclining. liod becomes so re»
mote "

Ironically, this is what happens
to ’l'omas. ln llll' end, the only
consolation he can offer is: “We
must trust in (lod. We must go
on living." lle survives by merely
giving li-serVIce to that which
was once important to him.
Only Martii, the woman who
stands by him, and lows him,
has hope:

“If I could only lead him out
of his emptiness, away from his
lie god. if we could dare to show
each other tcndcrniss. If we
would believe in a truth..."

The truth, “(loll is Love," is
no longer true, or enough.

three films is llial llii- l)avul
'l‘oiiias role has now passed out
of llll' picture liiornstrand‘s t'l'lil‘

to l’riesl, to total abstraction
Although he is not in The Sil-
('lll't‘ his presence haunls it, his
doubt, hii. own silence, and in
ability to communicate carries
over from the other films
(Wl/Ilcr Light is sub-tilled The
Unnlnmilcmilx). While this line
is moving towards abstraction,
the hub of each film moves
towards the physical, the cold,
the methodical and mechanical.

This can he used as a formula
for other aspects of the films,
but in this brief introduction,
more should be said individually

iriore complex films,

important. What is niosl inipor

the only cumplclclr \t’ll\’llll/
films. It makes one see, hear
(very loud silence, more olli-n
than not), feel, and, yes, cvr-n
taste and Loucli and smell. ll is
tight, close, unrelentless It is
i'rutiC, liniiit'tlizite, and torn
