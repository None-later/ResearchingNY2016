Mark-Almond Joy

To the Editor:

I too attended the Mark-Almond Band
concert which Kevin Daniels found unen-
joynble. Contrary to the void of feeling
which it. left with Mr. Daniels, 1 found it u
‘very enjoyable concert. Mark-Almond
was classiﬁed as a jazz band in the K110
and this is as close as you can come to
- describing them. Their music is not. for
bouncing around to, but. for listening and
concentrating on. 1 found some very
“moving” moments during their session
Itind from the periodic clapping I heard
Iduring a number and not just. at the end, 1
think that there were others like me who
’ especially appreciated the membt-rs'
'icfforts.

.- It. also appeared to me that quite a
5-substanlial portion of the audience
3,wantcd the band to reappear, rind they
lfrlid this with more enthusiasm than just
:' )ur of wanting “equality of price with
)erformancc”,

I also find it hard to Iit'IIl'VtE that Mr,
Daniels could call “Back tn the City"
which is incorrect. anyway) a survivor of
hrec years of Mark-Almond. The song
"The City” which the band played zit
Union contained similarities in tho Il‘itfl
vocal and the chorus- background mllsit‘
only. The rest of thr- song was completer
different. (If you wiin to compare, then-
were no drums in llit‘ original, instead (if
it flute solo Almond pltlyf‘tl Illt‘ sax in thi-
original, and there was no trumpl-i zit it”
in the original version.) As for the “ii-ss-
than iiurlible vocals“, I must agree that I
missed Jon Mark's vocals, for I (In liki-
tin-m, however, it jar/.7. liltilfl pliiys Illuslt‘

Sunday night-the campus dining halls
were closed and the GO. Snack Shop was
packed. I hurried hack to my room and
slipped in. Roommate gone-4 checked
the closets for EIf-infiltrators. I locked
the door. Clawing through my closet,
deep into a cardboard box in the back
corner, beneath a pile of dirty clothes, 1
found a 15-cenl, cellophane-wrapped
package of Beef Jerkey. I slipped back
out. into the hall, past the elf-seniries
outside (The pink one was sleeping in the
shower; the other two were playing
purchisi in the center stairwell.) and out.
into the night.

I rim. 1 slowed to a natural walk at. the
podium-past. the bookstore and into the
tunnel. As I passed under Education, I
could hear a Tyrannosaurus Rex rumbling
along to my left. He was tearing a
Humanities student apart with his tiny
hands. I wanted to cry out, but I
swallowed my nausea and slipped my
hand into my pocket to feel the cello-
phane package. Feeling reassured, I
walked around 1.0 the cayerns under the
natural sciences section of the Podium

of Ronco paper stock.

I found my Beef Jerkcy in my coat. and
carefully lore off the cellophane. I bit
into it, lasting 11, turning it over in my

mouth. I felt myself growling convul-
sivvly.
I heard footsteps. Someone was

running, splashing through the puddles in
the tunnel-echoing toward me. 1 thrust
my food I)IICI( into my pocket. and pulled
Lht‘ lzipels of my coat up around my neck.

A body hurtIt-d in beside me and lay
there, i'ringing and quivering, I recognized

Ride of Broom-Poney Executives

lIlhI'lIIIIIIt‘ to fill! Iiiﬂll si-Iiiiiiis And there's.

  

the creature as a ﬂedgling Central Council
Member that. I knew from my dorm. Hi:
was clutching a blue notebook to his
chest.

"Are they after your food too?" I
asked. I hadn’t. talked in hours and my
voice sounded alien to me.

“‘No! No!" he whispered vehemently,
hoarsely. “This is the SA. Budget"--he
pulled the notebook tighter to him--“1
took it. out. to read it over and they’re
after me..!"

"Who?"

“ The Great Green Dingoes on their
broom-ponies and their pursuing
hounds...!"

As he said this I could hear their
barking and tromping echoing toward us.
The ﬂedgling jumped up.

“No! No! Stay!" 1 clawed at his arm.

“I can't! I have to get away!" He
stumbled out. and splashed into the
tunnel. I heard him fall a few yards away.

"Eat it! Eat. the budget before it's too
late!" I felt myself screaming.

He scrambled up and ran on. I watched
him turn at a Stop sign as the men on
their broomsteeds pulled up beside me.
The dogs were barking and licking at. my
face. 1 think they smelled the Beef
Jerkey.

"Did ye see the varlet‘.’" cried one

I sat and stared at them. I was paranoid
as hell.

“He's just. a Plebean," said another.

"Aye," muttered the ﬁrst. “Well and
we'd best move on and about..."

They gallopped off, dragging the dogs
iIWﬂy. I felt for my Jerkcy and, ﬁnding it,
put it. in my mouth. I was still shaking
convulsively. I felt the spiced meal be-
tween my gums and it made me growl in
the brick of my throat.
