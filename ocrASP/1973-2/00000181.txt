The basketball playoffs get un-
derway tonight and all eight
teams have a shot at the crown.
It will be the breaks and possibly
the home court that will make
the difference. Here is a quick
analysis of the opening round
games.

BOSTON vs. ATLANTA: The
Celtics finished with the best
record in basketball and was a
surprise to many clubs. They are
centered around the fast break
and their center. Dave Cowans
runs it to perfection, Last year
Cowans was tired in the playoffs
and played badly. this year it
should be different. The major
reason wlty is the 'dCthllSIIIUII of
Paul Silas. A real totiin rebound-

er. he helps take the pressure off

Four Teams Chasing Red

by Kenneth Arduino

The National League West in
keeping with typical National
League style has a load of teams
that can win. Only the Padres
have no chance and a key injury
to a star will end the chances. A
rookie sensation could change
the whole team picture. It will
also be a season in which Hank

Cowans. John Havlichek is an
all-star and though hampered by
injuries should again lead the
team. The most improved ball-
player on the team is guard Don
Chaney. Always tough defensive‘
ly this year he has become an
offensive threat. The other guard
is Jo Jo White, a great offensive
shooter.

Atlanta has two fine shooting
guards in Pete Maravitch and
Lou Hudson. Both are relied on
heavily for the points and off
nights by them will end things
quick. Walt Bellamy at center
will Iiave to be inspired. He must
dominate the boards stopping
the fast breakaiid Gilliam. Both
have been injured but must rc-
lurii to top foriii to beat Boston.

NEW YORK vs. BALTIMORE:
Hayes and Uirscld are low men
who control the boards TIIC

Aaron makes his move at Ruth‘s
record.

Cinncrnati will try to retain the
crown but the West already have
one problem. Gary Nolan is iri-
jured rind the loss of him for any
part ofin season will hurt. Jack
Billiiighani. Ross Grimsly. Don
Gullct and Jim McGlotIrlin will
ham to pick up the slack. 'l‘ht-

bullpen is excellent with Clriy
Carroll and Pedro Borbon.

Johnny Bench leads a power
offense. Joo Morgan. 'I‘ony Per-
ez. Petr: Rasc and Bobby ’T‘olan
give the Reds cxplosivcncss and
speed. Richie Schcinblum and
Joc Ilaguv lead a top bench. If
there is a weakness. it‘s at short
but Darrel Channcy and Drch
(.‘oncription are adequate.

The San Francisco Giaan have
one key to their season - a
comeback by Juan Mririchal and
Sam McDowell. If they conw
back along with newly acquired
’l‘om Bradly. the pitching will be
good enough. Unfortunately, the
bullpen is non-existent. The
power is thvrr: with Willie Mc-
Covoy, Dave Kingman and
Bobby Bonds. Chris Spcir and

Bradley will nece$itate bringing
Lucas in.

‘The guards are another great
match up. Frazier vs. Clark,
Monroe vs. Chenier. They all
should neutralize one another
but an injury to one will swing
the tide. The beaches are about
equal.

MILWAUKEE Vs. CHICAGO:
.How to stop Jabbar is the name
of this defensive struggle. No
one has found the answer and
Ray and Awtry will be hard
pressed to stop him. Oscar
Robertson is a great one arid can
pour it on. Bob Dandridge and
Lucius Allen are maturing and
will help out.

Chicago, though, can‘t be cli-
triinatcd. Though their centers
do not score. the cxplosiveness
of Bob Love, Chet Walker. and
crry Sloan cannot be counted

out. Norm Van Lier is a tough
defensive guard and Chicago
plays a grinding defense.

IDS ANGELES vs. GOLDEN
STATE: L.A. are defending
champs and are still impressive
Wilt Chamberlain ,is shooting
over 70% and rebounding the
best in the league. Jerry West
and Gail Goodrich are explosive
guards and clutch performers.
MacMilliam and Bridges are ex-
cellent forwards and the bench is
strong. Pride also runs hiin on
this team.

Golden State intist Itavc the
shooting of Barry. Rtissell and
Mullins. Nate Tlittrrnond did a
great jrtb at the boards all season
and must do it again . The team
must play as one and not as
individuals like they seem to
want to. Only a team game can
heat LA.

5 for Top Spot

rT‘ito Fuentes hold down the
infield and Gary Maddox leads a
swift outfield. Dcrkor, Reuss,
Roberts and Wilson are good
pitchers. Ray and Cladding load
a more than adequate bullpen.
Catching is weak and the infield
of May. Helms. Mctzgcr and
Radar is just slightly above aver-
agc offensively. It is the outfield
that must carry the team. Jim
Wynn, Bob Watson and Caesar
Cedcno lead the outfield with
’l‘ommic Agcc and Jesus Alou
backing up. It is this outfield
that must produch to win.

The Los Aiigclcs Dodgers are
trying to come back and thr-
pitcliing must lead it. Downing.
John. Messcrsmith. Ostrion and
Sutton tll‘t‘ a top fchsomo, Brew-
er and Riclicrt lead tho bullpen.

A Year of Learning

by Bill Heller

Sitting it out. Warming the bench. Waiting for
next year. There. if needed. Wlialcvcr you call it. it's
plain not playing. Three returning Great Danes.
Dennis Terry. Jerry I'loggmtttt, and Felton Hyche, all
rookies. did not see too much action this year. This
was supposed to be a learning year for them. How
did they feel about it? This reporter posed six
questions. individually. to the trio.

ASP: Did you expect to play more this year than
you did?

HOFFMAN: [)oc told me it'd be a learning year.
but you still expect to play. It‘s a rotiin feeling
when you think you‘re good enough to play and
you don‘t get a chance

HYCHE: Definitely. I thought I'd play more this
year iii preparation for next year

TERRY: Naturally, although you need time to

HOFFMAN: No. If anything there was less pres-
sure for me. When I got in, the game was already
either won or lost. You're just filling in time till the
game ends. It just makes you want to contribute in
tight situations even more. Anybody can run and
gun.

ASP: What did you learn this year?

HOFFMAN: I've gotten 200% better defensively.
This is the first year I really learned how to play
defense. Alto. I got srnaricr working for Doc.

HYCHE: Ballhandling. team defense, running a
team as a guard.

TERRY: I learned what Doc wants y0u to do.
ASI’: Wltat about next year?

IIYCI'IE: I think I can help the team next year.
I'm looking forward to playing next year. but it‘s
going to be rough.

’I‘liRRY: I‘m coming out there to start at forward
on guard. I‘m going to work extra-hard this summer
on defense. jumping. and ballliandling. l have to
come back next year the best in everything. It‘s the
attitude yoti have to have.

IIOI‘FMAN: I‘m dying for next year to come
around. I feel I can handle the pressure of tight
situations. I‘ll Work really hard this summer on
quickness and ballltritidling.

ASI’, When you got down about not playing. what
did you tell yourself”

II()I’I5MAN: You have to realize you're not
working just tor this year. but next year and the
year after

IIY('III-.: It‘s the respect oi riiy peers that kept me
playing You just like to stick wttli soriictliiiij.r you
