Oakland's Tough Again in AL. West

by Nathan Salant

The Oakland A's are one of the
top teams in the A.L., and if you
want to talk about team with
depth. this is the place to begin.
Owner Charles Finley traded
away slugger Mike Epstein,
catcher Dave Duncan, and .314
hitter Matty Alou, but the As
attack will remain virtually un-
daunted.

Tlte pitching staff is super-
lative. and is probably the best
in baseball. The A‘s have solid
starters in Ken Hulthan, Jim
Odom. Vida Blue, and Catfish
Hunter. Rob Gardner. acquired
from the Yankees in the deal
wlticlt saw Matty Alou join
Felipe in New York, did a fine
job last season, and is counted
on as the fifth starter. Solid
relief will come Darold Knowles,
Rollie Fingers, and Paul Lind-
blad. the key in the Epstein deal.

The outfield will be led by
Reggie Jackson, art All Star, and
Joe Rudi, a .316 hitter. Bill
North and Angel Mangual will
share up center with their fine
defensive play, and the A's hope
to see some life in their hats.

Now tltat the A's have traded
lioldout Dave Duncan to the
Cleveland Indians for Ray Fossc.
the A‘s have added another
possible All Star to their col-
lection. Witli Fosse behind tlte
plate. series star Gene Tcriacc
Will take his glove out to first
base, and Mike Hegan Will sit
out. Three experienced hands
are prepared to play second 
Ted Kubiak. Dal Maxvrlle. and
Dick Green. Bat Throwing Bert
Campaneris Will miss a week irt
April, thanks to his delayed sus-
perisiort, but will be back to lead
the league in stolen bases. and
team leader Sal Bando cart be
counted on to do the job at the
"hot corner.“

Rich McKinney, Baiido's back-
up ai third, Will probably coir
irnue to find that corner too
hot, and Will see plenty of action

Sitting On
The

as the team’s DH. For Mc-
Kinney, a Yankee failure, the
DH will be a blessing because it
will keep his strong bat in the
lineup, and leave his non-
existent glove in the dugout.

ln sum, Oakland will be up
there to battle Chicago, Califors
nia, and any other surprises that
may come along, and the A‘s
look like the class of the AL.
West.

The California Angels may
make their first appearnce in a
pennant race this year, thanks to
some gifts from their arch rivals
the Dodgers. For injury prone
Andy Messersmith arid expend-
eable Ken McMulleri. the Angels
traded themselves into conten-
llOll.

Pitching will coritirtue to be
the Angel's strength. Nolan
Ryan should win at least another
20 games. as Will Clyde Wright.
Rudy May cart be couritedori. for
at least I5 wins, and a successful
comeback by newcomer Bill
Singer Will round out the 4 man
starting rotation. The bullpen is
one big question-mark, but be-
tween the DH artd those starters,
it may rarely be called upon.

Behind the plate will be Jack
Hiatt, a .289 hitter, and a good
defens'ive fielder. His backup Wlll
probably be Jeff Torborg, a dead
but With a super arm. First base
Will be occupied by Bob Oliver,
a poor fielder. now that Frank
Robinson hasjoined the outfield
squad. When Robinson is the
DH. the outfield duties Will he
shared among Keri Berry, a great
defensive outfielder who
iitatured its a hitter last season,
Vada l’inson, a very reliable vete-
ran, and the gift front the
Dodgers. Bobby Baleritine. Le-
roy Stanton, part of last years'
gift front the Mets (along With
Nolan Ryan) Will be available if
needed

Ai second base Will be Sandy
Aloniar, a fine second sacker,
Veteran Leo Cardenas Will hold
on to the shortstop slot, and the

NBA. Playoffs

Varsity Bench

tiorner will be allotted to ano-
ther Dodger present, Bill Grabar-
kawitz.

Look for a solid California
team, and a possible dark horse
winner in the West.

Chicago White Sox

The Chicago White Sox, or
Wood. Allen. and Company, are
back. and Willi more power arid
hitting than the Sox ltave ever
had. The acquisition of Ken
Henderson from the Giants has
strentliened their defense as well
as added another strong hat. The
Sox raitk as one of the most
explosive teams in the League on
the offensive side, but their
pitching may prove to be their
downfall.

What cart one say about Dick
Allen? MVP. HR leader. RBI
leader...No matter where he
plays, he cart, and Will do it all.

The Sox boast a fine outfield
With Ken Henderson, ('arlos
May, arid l’at Kelly, all of Whom
cart wield that stick and run like
Should one of them falter, Rick
Reichardt is Waiting in the Wirtgs
to step out of his DH role arid
take over.

Althouin lid llerrmann is
something of a defensive weak-
ness. his long balling but more
than makes up for the extra
bases opposing runners will take

be back. apparently fully re-
covered front his brokeit wrist.
and ready to renew his reign ol
terror as of old. Mikc Andrews.
no slough at but, Will corittriiic as
the keystoner for the double
play, and lid Spcmo Will be there
to flip him the ball frorii short-
stop.

On the mound Will be a defi-
title 25 gaiiie wriirier', Wilhtir
Wood, backed ltp by Stan Baliii
sen, a 20 game Winner. and
prontisirig newcomer Steve
Stone. Terry Forster Will anchor
the bullpen, but where the Sox
will go for pitching after that

First Round

remains to be seen, or Sain.

If the Sox ﬁnd a couple of
pitchers, they are a lock to take
the West  baiting injuries. If
not, then Oakland and Cat will
finish ahead of them.

Kansas City Royals

The Kansas City Royals will be
a typical mediocre team unless
they find themselves sortie start-
iitg pitchers. They have the rif-
fense, and the game‘s best young
power hitter iii John Mriybcrry.
Uriforturtately, wltilc be burned
tip the league last season, the
rest of the league did the same
tliirtg to all of the Royals' staff.

l’aul Splittorf. Wayne Simpson.
Dick Drago. arid Bruce Dal (‘iut-
ton are the untiiipressive starting
four.Tlie Royals are hoping for
comebacks by Keri Wrigltt and
Steve Barber. but after that.
they need help, If Ted Abcr»
riatliy can liritber up his 40 year
old arm. he Will be the bullpen.
Tltc Royals are placing hiin
hopes on rookie Mike Bitsby
who has pitched superbly in
spring training. Unfortunately,
they have no stopper who can be
counted on, and a lot of ifs and
uriimprcssrve arms. and Will pro-
bably lose many 7-6 type games.

Ed Kirkpatrick had a fine ‘72
season. and is the artcliorriian
behind the plate. John Mayberry
will rule first base. Star second
httSCtlttttl (‘ookic Rojas Will have
no trouble holding on to his spot
in the lineup, while l’aul Sclnttil.
lir'ed l’atck arid llal Mc('rac bat-
tle several rookies for the other
infield spots,

The outfield Will be strong
both ways, With llopkrris, Otis.
and l’inrella, dcprte the trade of
Scheinbloom to the Reds. You
can look for plenty of runs to
cross the plate both for arid
against the Royals, and you cart
also look for them to battle
Minnesota for the fourth spot iii
the West.

The Minnesota TWins are in big

trouble. They desperately need
big comeback seasons from the
constantly injured Tony Oliva.
and one time All Star Jim Kaat.
Without Oliva’s big bat, the
Twins can hang it up. Without
Kaat‘s arm, the Twins will be
desperately in need of three
starters.

The outfield is solid with
Oliva. If, as I suspect, Tony Sil\
out for it good part of the
season. the Twins will need it
body to join Larry l‘lislc and
slugger Bill Darwrri in the out-
field. The catching situation is
weak, With George Mittcrwald
and Phil Roof battling to sec
who can hit .200 and reach
second base on the third hop,
Danny Thompson and Rod

('tircw form a fine D.ll. corriho.

birt the elderly llar'nioit Killi-
brew may not be able to play
enouin first base to keep the
infield solid. The I)” Will help
llarntort. btit wlto wrll play first
base when he is sitting in the
dugout? Certainly not Sieve
Brtiuri who established himself in
llarritori's old position at third.
Joining Kaat iii the starting
rotation Will be Bert Blylevcit.
and Dick Woodsori. How the
Twins cart talk about a five mart
rotatiort With only Blylevcn
coming off a decent ‘72. ttitd
after trading Jim l’erry for a
minor leaguer, is beyond me.
How the Twrns could trade
l’crry for notliirtg is also beyond

me. How the Twins could lltIdC
away their Whole bullpen. I):ch
LaRoclic. is also hcyorid me. sir
perhaps their whole team theory
is beyond me.

The one tltiitg which is not
beyond me is the fact that the
Twins are in big troirble. With
the losses the Griffith's suficrcd
this past season, the aftcrriiath
of this one may find them on
relief. The Twrris may very pits.»
siny find themselves tcrrrbly
close to the Texas Rangers in the
cellar of the West.
