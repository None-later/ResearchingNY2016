School of Public Affairs MovesUpto

by Mindy Altman

Since it seems to be an accepted fact that Mohawk Tower on
Indian Quad will not be used for residence space, ilic tower is
rapidly filling up with various departments of ilic university,
particularly lliose in the social sciences.

One of the iicxi groups slaled to move is ilic Graduate School of
Public Affairs ((iSPA). currently locaied in ilic downtown campus in
Draper lliill, 'l'liey illl.‘ scheduled to mch in June and will be
occupying (» doors in lllt‘ Towcr. from U to I4 inclusive.

The move uptown Will be it big change for (iSPA. which has never
been located uptown. illltl Will mean a number of ililngs lo both

According Io Roy. /\. Speckhrird. Associate Dean of CSI’A, there
