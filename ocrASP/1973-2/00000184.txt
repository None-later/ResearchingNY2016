by Tony Rose

Once again, this campus ex-
presses its awareness of the fact
that Black is more than Beauti-
ful. it is an experience which
will be conveyed through the
events of this Black Weekend.
The concrete structures and for-
eign faces are left behind for
friends, ideas and Blackness. We
can relax and love ourselves once
more. We can put aside the
books and papers we are a slave
to and exert our energies to-
wards the education of our
souls.

The purpose of the Cultural

   

Weekend is to exchange ideas.
and absorb information concern-
ing our experiences. Most of all,
we will be striving to be togeth-
er, hoping we become more
adept as Black people and as
Black students. The weekend
will give us an opportunity to
explore facets of our lifestyles
and culture denied to us during
the school year.
Black Weekend—1973

This year’s weekend is April 6,
7 and 8. last year's weekend
was heavily funded so we had
more to work with. This year we

Poet Don L. lee will be featured this Sunday. April 8. as part of
