J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., Monday
rejected a White House effort to
obtain special treatment for
presidential aides in the Senate‘s
investigation of the Watergate
affair.

Ervin repeated his vow he will

seek the arrests of White
House aides if they do not honor
subpoenas to testify under oath
in formril private and public
sessions.

He also told a news conference
he believes White House counsel
John W. Deanlll was involved in
a “conflict of interest“ because
he apparently represented key
presidential advisers while trying
to learn if they were involved in
sabotage and espionage at-

tempts.
Later Monday, Ervin and the
special senate investigating

committee he heads Were criti-
cized by presidential press secre-
tary Ronald Ziegler.

Ther Watergate Investigation,
Ziegler said. has been “plagued
by irresponsible leaks of tidal
wave proportions" and Ervin
should “get his own disorganized
house in order so that the inves-
tigation can go forward in a
proper atmosphere of traditional
fairness and due process,“

Ziegler issued his statement at
the Western White House in San
Clemente,CaIif.

In New York, Republican
National Committee Chairman
George Bush said the President
has nothing to hide but his
.. .,. . ,

efforts to cooperate have been
“drowned in a stream of leaded
innuendo and hearsay.”

Ervin had been asked earlier
Monday about news leaks from
the special committee and said
“About all you can do is to pray
to the good Lord to give some
people a sense of restraint."

He said he intended to release
no such information “in the
absence of concrete evidence of
wrongdoing."

Ervin also said Monday he has
accepted an invitation by Atty.
Ge. Richard G. Kleindienst to
give committee members access
to the FBI‘s own Watergate in-
vestigation.

He said this access includes raw
FBI files which he said would be
safeguarded from public ex-
posure and would not them-
selves be placed in evidence.

Ervin called Nixon‘s claim of
executive privilege "spurious."
He said it does riot apply in
sitUations where there are allega-
tions of illegal or unethical cori-
duct.

Calling Nixon‘s extension of
the doctrine “executive poppy-
cock," Ervin said, “I think he‘s
shooting the so-called executive
privdege doctrine way out past
the stratosphere.“

Ervin said ifhe were president.
“I Would fire in not less than
two minutes any aide that wotild
not go down there and testify.“

Ervin refused to comment on
reports that convicted Watergate
burglar James W. McCord told

for arrest warrants if they are
ignored, Ervin said.

He said there are "multitudes"
of cases upheld by the courts in
which the Senate has issued such
warrants and tried persons for
contempt.

Asked if federal courts would
not free those arrested on writs
of Itabeus corpus, Ervin said it
was unlikely because the Senate

Do We Care?

This was the speech Marlon Brando wrote for delivery at the Academy
Awards Ceremony. where Brando refused an Oscar. The speaker was
Slitislteen Littlefeatlier. We print it here as a guest editorial.

For 200 years we have said to the Indian people who are fighting for their
land, their life, their families and their right to be free: “Lay down your
arms, my friends, and then we will remain together. Only ifyou lay down
your arms, my friends, cart we then talk of peace and come to an agreement
which will be good for you."

When they laid down their arms. we murdered them. We lied to them. We
cheated them our of their lands. We starved them into signing fraudulent
emerits that we called treaties which we never kept. We turned them
irs on a continent that gave life for as long as life can remember.
