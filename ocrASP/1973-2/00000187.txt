By Bill Brim reel/my

The long-awaited product of the reunion of the
a ﬁve original Byrds is out, and it is my painful duty
to inform you that Byrds (Asylum SD 5058) just
isn’t what it could have been. It is often pleasant
and professional, and at times even charming. The

ing feature.

if this album is a reliable indication of who’s
where, then maybe Gene and Chris should go hunt
up McGuinn’s last set of sideman and go out on
their own.

story, Wyke, for all his failure iit
prose. is actually quite brilliant.
alld loves games. Oh yes, he
loves games. Director Mailkie-
wiez lets its kilow jlist how much
with shots of his animated fig—

sense of mystery. excitement, or
suspense, and his (and Schaf—
fer's) major profound statement
about how decadent old men
must make way for decadent

young men is so completely
worthless that it lodged in my
mind afterwards and produced
profound concern as to why it
was included.

There’s nothing new, signifi-
cant, or entertaining here. Stay
home, check the TV listings, and
wait far a rerun of'TheIMaltese
