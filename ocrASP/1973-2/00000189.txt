Associated Press, San Diego by
Ron Roach

Keri Norton, a relatively un-
known "ham-and-egg" fighter,
out-slugged Muhammad Ali Sat-
urday and upset the former
heavyweight champion. Norton
was awarded a split decision in
the 12-round bout.

Norton, a 28-year old ex-
Marine whose biggest prior pay-
day was only $8,000 , picked up
$50,000 and opened the door
for million-dollar purses by
whipping the “people's champ-
ion.” the former heavyweight
champion of the world.

Immediately after the fight,
Ali’s manager, Angelo Dundee,
said Ali had suffered a broken
jaw in the first round, but there
was no visual evidence except
for slight bleeding from inside
the mouth that Ali was badly
hurt.

Referee Frank Rustich scored
the fight 7-5 for Norton, judge
Hal Rickards had Norton ahead
5-4 and judge Fred Hayes favor-
ed Ali 6-5. The Associated Press
favored Norton 7-4.

There were no knockdowns in
the fight that saw Norton pressu-
re Ali throughout.

The partisan crowd of about
12,000 at the San Diego Sports
Arena cheered wildly as Norton

frequently forced Ali into the

corners and banged away with
haymakers to the body and
head.

Norton, from Jacksonville, Ill.I
but fighting out of San Diego,
entered the bout ranked as high
as sixth in the world but was
rated a 5-1 underdog to the
31-year-old Ali, who had won 10
ﬁghts since his only previous
defeat, the heavyweight title
match against Joe Frazier two years
ago.

"You missed me, sticker!" Keri
Norton mocked Muhammad Ali.
"You ain't hit nothing but a
ghost."

Norton, a powerfully built ex--
Marine carried on a one-way
conversation as the usually loq-
uacious Ali kept his mouth
closed.

After Saturday's fight, when
Norton shocked the boxing
world by winning a 12—round
split decision, the reason for the
former heavyweight Champion‘s
silence was explained: A Norton
punch had fractured his jaw in
the first round. The 31-year-old

Ali, who used to “float like a
butterﬂy, sting like a bee," did
neither. Yet despite the injury,
he very nearly won the fight.

Ali was taken to Clairemont
General Hospital where an hour
and a half of surgery was needed
to wire together his left jaw-
bone, broken three-quarters of an
inch apart.

Ali will be hospitalized “for
two or three days," his trainer,
Anglo Dundee, said Sunday.
“From all indications, he's going
to be fine."

Dundee was ready to call any-
one a “jerk” who suggested that
Ali is washed up as a fighter.
“We've already talked and he
asked how long it might be
before he can get back into
training," Dundee said.

Yet he admitted “everything's
up in the air. What's the sense of
even trying to project? You
don’t know. The doctor pro-
jected three months but you
never know. It’s all according to
how the healing goes."

Norton wasn't sure which
punch-“I think it was an over-

hand right” broke the jaw of Ali,
who was in his 11th fight since
losing to Joe Frazier two years
ago for the undisputed title.

“I didn't see the punch that
did it," Dundee said, "but after
the first round he had a fleck of
blood, a clot, on his lip. Then his
mouthpiece started filling up
with blood. I knew his jaw was
broken. I wanted to stop the
fight before the second round
but Ali wouldn‘t let me."

Ali was in good condition at
221 pounds, 11 more than Nor-
ton, Dundee said, “and without
the broken jaw he destroys this
guy head over heels."

Ali “proved what I've known
all along," Dundee said. “He has
all kinds of guts. How can any-
one question his courage?
They‘ve done that all along, you
know."

Norton, at 6-feet-3, stood as
tall as Ali but at 210 pounds
weighed 11 pounds less than the
seemingly sluggish favorite.

He had never gone more than
10 rounds in his 29-1 pro career
and appeared to tire in thc llth

when Ali’s punches seemed to
carry more sting and brought
blood from the inside of Nor-
ton’s mouth.

But the underdog came out in
the 12th still trying for the
knockout over All instead of
settling fora decision.

Hearing the shrieks of encour»
agement from the crowd, he
took the offensive, backing Ali
into the ropes and whaling away
with both hands for the sixth
time in the fight.

Ali, now 41-2, was guaranteed
$210,000 for the fight. He
waged a fairly even battle Wilh-
out a damaging blow until Nor-
ton connected with a right that
dazed Ali 40 seconds into thr-
sixth round.

To find error with Nathan's
article was unfortunnlley too
easy. For openers Buford will
not be in Baltimore‘s outfield,
he has gone to Japan. Other
factual mistakes are “Merv
Rettcnmund a fine rookie of
two seasons ago” (He is about to
enter his sixth season in the
majors); "34 year old Woodie
Fryman“ (He will be 33 on April
12); “ latcs Brown is over-
weight, 35" (He will be 341 in
May).lf Mr. Salant would check
the April l975i issuc of lirlrchu/I
Digt'SI he an Vcril'y thr-
ages. Nrrtlian' m-ling for thr-
Ynnlrr-cs shows up in his writing.
For example, hc said lliiil “AI
33, Matty (Aloul is by no riiciriis

'I‘iant no youngster and Nathan
wonders if he can still pitch

Luis 'l‘iant is only 32 years old

Nathan also claims that Brooks
Robinson, Mike Oiellarzmdjusr

about the whole 'I‘igcr [cam is
too old. One wonders if ugc is so
important to Nathan in looking
at baseball teams then why did
