Mural Brightens UpE

The splash of color Iivening up
the second floor balcony area of
the Campus Center is the creat-
ion of Jon Henry of the Ed-
ucational Communication
Center. Tire 160 foot mural took
three months to complete arid
consists of twenty 4’x8' panels.
It is painted iii six coats of
liquitex arcylic paint on mas-
ontte. Gallery lights may be pur-
chased to illuminate the area.

The mural was paid for by the

Among the fundamental prin-
ciples of Twin Oaks are non

sexes. In one of the slides Ms.
Wise showed as part of Iier lec—
ture. a male Twrn Oaker was

plaiiied that this was typical of
the iron-sexual itatttrc of work at
Twin Oaks, She herself is a
member of Twin Oaks construc-
tion company.

The principle of non-competi-
ttori pervades every area of Twni
()aks' life, front volleyball to
sex. Volleyball. according to Ms.
Wise. is it major pastime at Twin
Oaks. It is iroir-coiitpetitive be-
cause members do irot keep
score, and instead of rotating by
teaiti, they rotate under the net.
As for sex, Ms. Wise explained

by Julian Schuman

Alternate Feature Service
It seems like only yesterday.

“The expert China-watchers who
congregate here in Hongkong are
more than usually agog, and no
wonder." China’s leaders “were
going to plunge this poor coun-
try rigltt through the bottom
again...The epople are exhausted
and disillusioned."

the author of this clap of
thunder was Joseph Alsop
perched in the British colony in
late May, 1964 on one of his
China fact-finding missions. For
15 years this eminent, national-
ly-circulated American colum-
nist had been issuing prognosti-
catiori of Cassandra proportions
on China' fate. This time he had
the country sinking into depths

It was less than a yearafter l

second time. Living in Peking, I
had already journeyed to the

1900-63, it seemed to me and
other observers Itere, as well as
the Chinese, that in general pro-
gress was talking place. Whatever
their mood, the Chinese scarcely
appeared disillusioned. (I had
scarcely had time to unpack
when in early October, 1%}. I
was brought up to date by Mr.
Alsop as to what was happening.
I was living in the rttidst of “a
worse pass than (,‘Itiiia Iias ever
experienced")

ly. the coltirirnist continued to

intellectuals" had been “reduced
to the meanest forms of menial
labor in physical conditions that
would shock a inormal jail-
visitor.“

Turning his guns on US. in-
tellectuals and liberals and left-
wingers, Mr. Alsop pointed out
that “Monster Stalin used to be
slavered over by the European
left. Mad old monster Mao is
slavered over by the American
left today."

For this unbending scholar of
China affairs nothing had
changed, at least not until Mr.
Alsop got back to China after an
absence of about 25 years.

Having spent a month here he
has now joined the ranks of the
not so few American tltiiikers on
China who have revised their
previous conceptions about this
country. It
welcome him aboard.

becante the order of the day,
leaving slaveriiig readers of the
old Alsop gasping, if not feeliitg
betrayed, “‘Much of what I saw,"
Ire cabled on December 3, “was
eye-popping."

A December 15, 1972 report
front Nanking by the author
informed the Alsop readership
that “the change Ill (‘Iiina may

prove ntore iittpoiaiti for the

world future than the change in
Russia that took place with
Lenin’s October revolution."'

Writing on the same subject -
the new Alsop was “conﬁdent
that the month I have spent in
the New China constitutes the
most significant reportoral work
i have ever done" - he had
further thoughts. "The right way
to see the new China, in truth, is
to forget the communist label,
and to consider the revolution as
a specifically Chinese event."

Like any number of old China
hands who returned to China
after many years, he saw places
he had been familiar with during
his younger days. In the case of
Captain Alsop of World War II,
it was his old stampiitg grounds
in the southwest, Szechuan and
Yunnan province.

Pouring over the steady stream
of recent happy tidings coming
out of every place in Cltina
visited by the distinguished
author, I reached back iit merit-

yesteryear.

China Report: Evervthiniz Has Chanmﬂ

“gnawing hunger, made worse
by chain-gang conditions, now
prevails in every region of the
Chinese countryside."

It was only a few years later
that China was to ﬁnd herself
plunging into even more and
more misery by way of an
Alsop-contrived “descending
spiral.“ According to his calcula-
tions, Chairman Mao might have
to sacrifice millions of lives to
save his regime from collapse.
Then came the “vanishing Chi-
nese" since it appeared the peo-
ple were living on 600 calories a
day, an intake scarcely enough
to sustain a one-year-old.

China’s population has moved
forward. as has the world.

With his own eyes last Decent-
bet and .Ianttary Mr. Alsop
learned that there is flexibility
and efficiency in the People’s
Republic - “Everything in China
Iias changed." "the quality of
life has changed, vastly for the
worse for the ancient ruling class
but for the better for everyone
else." Whatever tears need be
shed for the ancient ruling class,
a tiny fraction of China‘s hun-
dreds of millioits, this is no small
laccomplishment Mr. Alsop has
acknowledged arid it certainly
was not arrived at in the last few
years.)

A trip to a commune brigade
outside Chungking proved to be
“a marvelous experience."Shops
in Yu Hsi country (population
200,000) in Yunan province
“are nearly as well stocked as
the shops in Peking." In the case
of Peking, other visitors like Mr.
Alsop have credited the Chinese
capital with a surprising variety
of products in the stores.

For those of us old enough to
be familiar with the old relent-
less Alsop, this, indeed, is no
small change. Having waited
around a considerable number of
years for the Alsop Armageddon
in China, there are those for
whom the time has arrived to
cast away all illusions.

As to other longtime devotees
who may still be clinging to the
hope of the returit of Mr.
Alsop's old friend Chiang Kai-
shek there may be some disillu-
sionment in tire ranks. After all
lie had once told all of us:
“There is in fact nddoubt at all
that Chiang and his government
at present intend to make the
landing attempt on the Chinese
mainland early this summer, or
perhaps in the next favorable
season in the autumn" of 1961.

For such followers there is
little left. They can only bleakly
inquire: “Say it isn‘t so, Joe?"
