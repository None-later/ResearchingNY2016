Ann Arbor Political Party Opts For Radical Change,

by Ed Zuckerman

ANN ARBOR, Michigan (CPS)
»~ The meeting in the basement
of the public library here looked
like an 803 meeting, circa 1969.
The hair was profuse and the
rhetoric high. When a resolution
was brought up to support the
Indians at Wounded Knee, and
one person questioned whether
the group should support an
"illegal" action, the resolution's
sponsor cried, “Every fucking
things that‘s right is illegal!"
Half of the too people at the
meeting cheered.

But the major debate of the
evening was not over whether
the group should seize a budding
in sympathy. Instead the young
people dcbatcd how many candi-
datcs they should run in the
upcoming school board election

For this was a meeting of an
electoral political group the
Human Rights Patty (IIRI’) of
Ann Arbor, Its roots clearly lie
in the student movement at the

giant University of Michigan
here. But. when these young
radicals were admonished to

"work wrtliiri the system." they
did Now they are a major force
in local politics.

In last spring‘s city council
election. the Human Rights Par-

ty deﬁed all predictions by win-
ning 24 per cent of the vote
city-wide and two council seats
in wards heavily populated with
students. The HRP wins, which
came at the expense of liberal
Democrats. resulted int a dead-
locked city council, where the
Republicans have live votes, the
Democrats four, and the HRP
two. With no party having a
majority, it took two parties to
pass anything. In general, it was
the Democrats and the HRP who
got together,

“The gap in rhetoric between
us and the HRP is great." said
Dcmocratic Mayor Robert
Harris. "The HRP says We want

socialism and total public owner-
ship of everything In the world.‘
and the Democrats won't say
that. But when you get away
lrom the rhetoric. there is very
little difference operationally be-
tween the “RP and the Demo-
crats, while ilic gap between the
Democrats and the Republicans
IS Wild."

Accordingly, when the time
came to dectdc how to spend
$1.4 riiillion in revenue-sharing
ftiiids this year. the Democrats
took one look at the Republican

proposal, which allocated

Seek Advice From Wise,

(ZNSJ The l'ollowmg passage is
a diiccl quotation lioni a Boy
Scout riiaiiual of lllt‘ niidvl‘l-Ill's:
(quote)

"In this chapter much has been
said of the active measures
which a boy should take in order
to become strong and well We
should be equally concerned in
savnig and storing up the natural

forces which we already have.

“lit the body of every boy Itl
lits teens, a very iiriportarit lltiid
is produced This Iluid is impor-
litlll ot the whole body Sonic
parts ol it lirid their way into
lllt‘ blood, and through the

blood givc tone to the muscles,

power to the brain and strength
to the nerves. This is tlic sex
ﬂuid and is formed by the testi-

clcs.

“When it appears to a boy's

body, it works a wonderful
change. Ilis chest deepens, his
shoulders hioadcn, arid his ideals

aic changed and enlarged '

“When it boy reaches the gc of
15. to, or 17. this llu1d is
occaslnnally discharged from the
sex organ in the night...” is a
perfectly normal experience...
boys need not worry about these
experiences. Tlle are natural,
but no steps should be taken to
excite seminal emissions. That is
ttlitslllll’wllt)“.

$500,000 to debt retirement and
$200,000 to garbage collection,
and promptly fled to make a
deal with the HRP, whose pro-
posal is heavily weighted in favor
of child care, health care, and
youth and drug programs.

The HRP has also won Demo-
cratic support to pass ordinances
that make it illegal to discrimi-
nate in housing or employment
against anyone because of sexual
preference or marital status,and
that prohibit employment agen-
cies from supplying scab labor to
companies undergoing strikes.
The city council has also. under
I'lRl’ prodding, endorsed the let-
tuce and Farah pants boycotts
and designated one week last
June as Gay Pride Week.

And there was, of cotttsc. the
law that made Ann Arbor l‘a-
omits: the ordinance that it‘-
duccd the penalty for smoking.
possessing or selling marijuana to
a $5 line. The law was struck
down by a local judge last fall
because of its conflict with state
law. but, wlnlc the case is being
appealed by the city, the 35 law
remains In effect

While the Democrats have
joined the HRP to pass these
laws, they have turned around
and voted with the Republicans
to reject many other llRl’ pro
posals. Among those that have

been defeated, generally by a 9-2
vote, were proposals to cut off
city services to war industries, to
forbid the importation of strike-
breakers from out of the city, to
establish rent control, and to
appoint public housing tenants
to the city housing commission.

But, to the HRP, a loss can be
as good as a win, since the city
council chamber provides a tra-
ditional political forum for radi-
cal political ideas.

"We want to bring up things
that can be passed," says HRP
council member Nancy Wechs-
ler, “but some issues dealing
with community control and
worker control are beyond the
order of what you can have in a
capitalist society. By bringing
them up, and having them de-
feated, we help make people
aware of the contradictions of
capitalism."

Both Wechsler and her HRP
colleague .Ierry De Grieck say
they consider themselves “revo-
lutionaries,” “But I don't know
if there will be a revolution in
this country for a hell of a long
time, to say the least," says De
Grieck. “And nobody is giving
us a blueprint. I think, at this
point in time, in this town, a
third party is a good thing to
invest energy m."

Adds chhsler: “The hardest
question wc have is when to

settle for what we don’t want.
The question is: Does it really
represent some kind of change?
Even when we acaept a compro-
mise, we always make the point
that it's not enough."

Ann Arbor Republicans ex-
press distaste for HRP style
(Wechsler and De Grieck come
to council meetings in blue jeans
and have on occasion sent out
for pizza). But politically the
Republicans simply view the
HRP as “little Democrats."

Because they appeal to the
same left-of-center constituency,
HRP criticisms of the Demoerats
are harsh, and the Democrats
reply In kind.

"The Republicans are just
sitting back and enjoying all
this." said Democratic Council-
Inaii Norris Thomas. He, like
nearly everyone else in town,
expects the Republicans to
sweep to the inayorship and a
majority on the city council in
next month's election as a result
of the Democrats and HRP split-
ting thc non-Republican vote.

But the HRP is not concerned.
“We can't look out for the inter-
ests of the Democrats," says De
Grieck. “1n the long run,l don‘t
think it will make much differ-
ence anyway if the Republicans
win. It‘s one of our principles
that the Democratic Party is not
going to bring about social
change. If we accept the lesser-
evilism trip. it just keeps us
farther away from the goal."
