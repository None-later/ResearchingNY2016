by Mark Gilmotir

I place this statement as candiy
date for the Understatement of .

the Week Award: Friedrich
Nietzsche is not parlor reading.
Nietzsche wrote Thus Spake Zar-
athustra in 1885. He went insane
in 1890. He died in 1900.
Strauss paid tribute to this man
by naming his primeval-futuristic
composition Also Sprach Zara-
thustra; it’s better known as the
theme to 2001:A Smchdys-
seyrrhe ﬁgure Zarathustra runs
back thonsands of years to the
origins of Zoroastrianism.
Nietzsche’s work runs a few
thousand years ahead. of our
present state of civilization in its
humanitarian import. Much as
we are inﬂuenced today by the
works of the Beatles and Jimi
Hendrix, Nietzsche found much’
of his inspiration in Richard
Wagner. Just as our generation is
being inﬂuenced by Vonnegut
and Tolkien and Hesse, these
men were inﬂuenced directly
(predominantly Hesse) or indi-
rectly by the works of Friedrich
Nietzsche. Tolkien wrote a trilo-
gy; this man wrote three, though
they‘re-nonfiction.

Zarathustra spent ten years in
his cave with his serpent and his
eagle and he finally came down
to the Market Place to tell the
people all about the great things
that he‘d learned about life in
his days of meditation and cori-
templation of the workings of
nature. No one wanted to hear.

performance of a rope dancer.
All causists, truth-seekers, self’
proclaimed gurus and 'Bodhavis-
tas can find a strong identity
factor in Zarathustra and his
frustrations with the bourgeoisie
herd.

Zarathustra is, in part, a satire
on the Bible; it‘s constructed
complete with songs and psalms
as well as the “gospels” of Zara-
thustra. It is in itself a Bible ~— a
textbook on how to transcend
one‘s level of existence. If it
doesn‘t contain the means, it
certainly stands as a strong ex-
hortation. if you think that you
understand the physical unt-
verse, that you have the an-
swerfs) to man‘s problems, that
you‘re a highly intellectual and/
or spiritual person and that

floundering, fool,

Mr. Nietzsche wrote this book

liberation With Caution

By Barbara G. Ortok

A step towards liberation
comes when a woman can
View the different societal sex
roles and prohibitions and
make her own decisions about
how to deal with them.

The less restrained college on-
vironmcnt, the freer dorms and
apartments can provide a place
for the emerging woman to do
some growing. Usually she now
has more freedom to think
about her body, her morality,
and her sexuality than she did
before: at home and in high
school, where most people
weren't very open and often
not. very interested in changing
the rules by which women
must be bound.

So now we st-c llll' collegi-
wumnii facing her (lllL‘lnIlil zi-
bout her si-xualily. The woman

stinence, or hetero- or homo-
sexuality (against htir inncr
desires) is still sadly trapped in
her own personal chains, no
matter how free other people
judge her to be. We must
make our own decisions and
follow them through before Wl'
will be on our way to frec-
dom. Liberty is not the girl
who is an easy lay only. Being
ashamed of onc's virginity or
homosexuality should lend a
woman to a decision, not an
cmbarrassud avoidance of sex.
We must come to terms with,
and love, our sexuality, our do
sires, our goals.

them? That freedom is only
given from their attention (sex-
ual or otherwise)? Women
without underwear are stared
at, whistled at, commented on,
grabbed at, "approached" by
the more respectable men and
attacked by the more animal-
istic. We must realize this atti'
tude and take it into account
as we make decisions about
our clothes. We may do well
to consider what happch to
people around us when we
don‘t. wear them.

own puss sion of our own

our bodies? 'I'hey ttrc beautiful,

and full of life. Realization of
this can lead us to “free our-
selves“ too far. A woman
whose body is up for grabs
has as much liberty as the
woman who is imprisioned by
sexist mores against her de-
sires. As long ns women are
looked at. as pieces of meat, as
long as it is acceptable to ogle
us when we walk down the
street our freedom will not be
complete, no matter how
much personal liberation we
attain. A big part. of liberation
comes with the understanding,
acceptance, and love of our
own bodies. But true liberation
only can exist when everybody
is free from regarding women
as incomplete without men, as
lesser beings, as sex objects.
Women are beautiful, richly o-
iitritioiial, sensitive people,
wonderfully different from
men in many ways. Our differ-
ences are important arid wor-
thy of repect and love. We
wouldn‘t be women without
them.

Young View of Washington

A Good Time Had By All

Roy L. Ash, director of the
President's Office of Manage-
ment and Iiudgct, came up to
the, Hill the other day to try
to convince House members
that his was not a position
that should require Scnatc cuti-
firmntitin.

As it turned out, the on
counter was it scene straight
out of student government
(lays, conducted in uncertainty

But first it little background.
Ash, whose present position
often has been termed second
only to that of the President
in its power, is a former chief
i-xcciitive of Litton Industries,
which presently has mtirc than
it half billion dollars in dis

l.ltl' Navy. Several weeks ago
(in n column crititlctl "Exit

operational powers like depart-
ment hcntlii, no powur tit nil,
in fact, except llti an agent of

the President carrying out ad-
ministration policies.

Aftcr the snickch died down,
Rep. Chet Holifield (D-Calif.)
politely disagreed with Ash's
own assessment of his power,
and allowed as how it scumcd
pretty clear to him that con-
trol of the purse strings in-

duties.

Rep. John J. Rhodes
(R-Ariz.) then contributed his
belief that Congress ought not
to pass the bill “in a fit of
pitjut‘." over Mr. Nixon‘s im-
poundmcnt activities. No
points: very weak rejoinder.

All in all, everybody’s
tongues seemed prctty well on-
trcnchcd in their respective
cheeks, and then the Justice
Department contributed its
two-cents worth and nearly
topped the whole show.

'I‘heir judgment is that the
legislation is unconstitutional,
because it would retroactivoly
require conﬁrmation of Ash,
requiring him to be removed

Churches look Homeward

Churches, after a generation
of preoccupation with spread-
ing their inﬂuence abroad, are
looking homeward.

Foreign missions are being
de-emphasized by many de-
nominations. Morc and more
pastors intend again to tend
their own ﬂocks.

Unless our own house is in
order, we preach a hypocritical
sermon to the rest of the
world.

Moral degeneracy and social
conﬂict in our United States
has been less than a good ex-
ample.

Thc other day a vagrant was
brought into the Memphis city
court of Judge Ray Churchill;
he was tired, hungry, homeless,
and 72,

Judge Churchill asked, “Does
this man deserve to go to jail‘.’
Yet, can I send him back to
the streets to starve?"

His honor said, “I'm going to
give him 30 days just. to put a
roof over his head as some
public charity should have
done. But, with all the chari-
tics in Memphis, I‘ve never
seen a rcprtnsentative of any
one. of them in this courtroom
trying to help. I have to put. a
man in jail against his will and
mine because those multi-
million dollar charities choose
to look the other way."

Charity, when it was called
"charity," was administered by
churches on a most. efﬁcient
and effective neighborhood,
pcraon-to-pcrsun level.

Government “welfare” admin-
istered by half-a-hundred fed-
eral, state and local agencies

church charity.

Most organized charities, with
their top-heavy administrative
expenses, have tended to dis-
courage voluntary giving for
our home-front. poor.

But. there is increasing evi-
dence that churches-including
some of the most liberaI--are
re-evnluating their mission, re-
viving the old “charity begins
at home" concept.

And the religious recession of
the 1960’s is ending--- coinci-
dent with, if not directly re-
lated to, the churches’ renewed
relating to the needs of home
folks.

Further, the psychological
fascination for exotic places
which heretofore motivated
much generosity in the direc-
tion of foreign missions is nil
in our shrinking world.

Episcopalians and United
Presbyterians, watching the re
sponse in more conservative
churches, haVe themselves
about-faced homeward, giving
regional and local divisions
more say-so as to where their
money goes.

It's not an either-or realign-

ment; it‘s ti shift in emphasis.
Even the ultraliberal United
Church of Christ is curtailing
foreign missions-~increasing the
share of each collection which
each church keeps for its own
disbursal.

And now concern is that any
church, to justify its existence,
must. rclatc primarily and
directly to the inLErcsLs of its
own congregation, its own
home community.
