Towards More Efficient Wars

By Robert Manning

Iii War Wit/mill l’iill. Mlt‘llttl‘l
Klier has illuminated [\ITH'I‘lt'lel
global strategy in all its iiiili
tary and political dimensions
with a devastating thorough
ncss. In doing so, he avoids
both the redundancy of radical
litany and the uluofncss of at"
tidemiu.

With a veritable ocean of
documentation, Mr. Klarc illii
strates the MiliLary-lndustriiil

1n the face of such plans us
are so skillfully depicted by
Mr. Klurc, the conclusion is iii-
cvitablc lhul. Vietnam, far from
being an aberration of Americ~
an policy, is just ii test, and
that the government hopes
that the wars of the future
will be more efficient, as the
wrinkles in American counter-

Dialogue in Ab '

By Andy Rafkin

“It's not. the dilly-dollying
that gets to me." Look at that
crowd shufflel'.

Two friends sit on a second
floor hotel lobby and look out
over the street through the
long dusty windows. The
crowd slices each other. each
person just missing the ﬂying
meteor of a soul that dazzles
past him, past. him leaving be-
hind only 0 trailing smell of
the morning’s wetted down
deodorant. All saying hello in
the brushing of sleeves. The
two lobby sitters continue.

“It gets to me but the ter-
rible thing is I enjoy it. 1
mean 1 really dig just sitting
here, doing nothing, often
thinking nothing. Like a cut, I
sit, blink and look knowledge-
able.”

“What about that job you
bad? You can't. go oti saying
those kind of things about
yourself. You'll go erazy!...You
do tlo plenty!“ _

The first friend watches two
young girls' hips slide past
him. They are jibbering in
some language he doesn’t un—
derstand. “I quit two days
ago," he finally heaves with re-
licl‘. The shock of this news
grabs his friend‘s Lhrout.

“Owwwliiii'? Already?"

“11mm”, the first one sings.

“What happened to that
surge of independence? 'l‘hat
drive Lo build Rome. You

looked lo the sky.“

“Home wouldn‘t fit in the
1)1|L'k of 11 kitchen. Besides, I
could only get hamburgers for
lunch in that damned DriVe-in
bordcllo.”

at the back of the kitchen.
When I went down there once
to get some more ammonia l

office was in that dark base-
ment. His ofﬁce door was
chained, but. not tightly
enough so that I couldn't see

“Well. I‘ll be."

“What will you be. You sit

“Well, 1 hate it."

The second man doubles

“1 hate it because 1 get

"1...1 enjoy it from the inside
out though. You give yoursrzlf

At that moment in young girl
walks up the stairs that lead
up to the second story lobby.
Her blond hair kicks and
sways with her eyes, with her
walk, antl with the spring
breeze that follows her ascent.

“Well I’m goin‘ to how: to

first friend.

The pretty blond sets a trick-

as she sees the first friend
rushes to him. Her arm links
