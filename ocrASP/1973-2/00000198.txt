 (1 You. Scarecrow -

by Josephy Daughertyl

There will be ample film on campus this weekend
for even the most ardent cinephile.

On Friday, the Internatioiral Film Group will
complete its series on the Cinema of Ingmar
Bergman with the recent The Passion ofAnna :. The
film is the story of few people tortured in different
ways by their pasts and an inability to cope with the
present. There‘s Andreas (Max Von Sydow) who lras
adopted the life of a hermit after a ruthless divorce.
He meets Anna (Liv Ullman) crippled by the auto
accident that claimed the lives of her husband and
son...an accident she feels responsible for. She clings
to her “happy memories" but she remembers the
marriage as being better than it really was. Anna is
living with married friends, Elis (Erland Josephson)
and Eva (Bibi Andersson). Elis, a cynical architect,
can only deal with things on a cold, business-like
level. He Iras gone so far as to amass a large
collection of photographs of people for his private
study into the nature of "emotion." Among those
in his file is his wife, Eva, who moves under the
constant fear that Elis will someday “see through
her."

Bergman places his four characters on a small
island; then isolates them even further by placing
them miles from the only village. The metaphor of
hermitage and guilt is extended by the presence of a
lonely old man suspected of torturing the island's
animals.

People tortured by their emotions or lack thereof
has been a continuing theme through the work of
Ingmar Bergman. Nowhere is this theme more
dramatically demonstrated than in The Passion of
Anna" The film Will be shown on Friday at 7:15 &
9:45 in LC 18.

For those rrrtercstcd in somethrrrg a little different
in their filmg SunyCinema wrll present It'va Was.
Everything But Legal! on Friday at 7:30 and 10:00
in LC 25. You can bring your own raincoat or rent
one at the door.

Midnight, Friday in LC 18,0ffcrs the opportunity
to View the early work of a young American
director. Many people think I’cter Bogdanovich’s
first film was Tire Last Picture Show. Almost three
years before Picture Show brought him to promi-
nencc Bogdariovich made his first. and perhaps best,
filnizTurgEIS., Made on a low budget in 1908 while
Bogdanovrch was working as an assrstarit director
for Roger Corniari, Targets is a chilling exploration
into the nature of fear. The film has been called a
“real horror movie," in that the horror comes frorii
the nature of our everyday lives and not front the
laboratory of a irrad scientist. Targets tells the story
of two men. cach unknown to the other, and the
actions that Will bring them face to face in one of
the most electrifying climaxes iii the history of
sound llllll 'l‘hcrc'rs Ilyroii ()rlock (Iloris Karloff Ill
ltl\ lttsl American role) a star of lroiioi films who
decides to rctirc when he sees that the terror of
everyday life in irrbari America lar surpass ariytlrrrrg
hc could do on the screen. As a favor to a young
director frrcrid (played by liogdrirrovrch) ()rlock
plans to make a lrircwcll appearance at .r driverrr

is a nice, clean-cut young man who drives a white

him to the drive-in movrc where Orlock is to appear.
lle hides behind the huge secrrerr and masked by lhc
artificial horror of the movie he deals out true
horror...rea| death.

It is rgre that a film achieves such a galvanizrrig
effect. Targets is unique as a filrri arid as an
observation on the nature of our society. It is
impossible to rccoirmicird it strongly enough. 'l'ar-

SunvCinema will present Vittorio De Sica‘s The
Garden of The Finzi-Contr'nis 0nS'dlllrd‘dy. April 7th
at 7:30 and 10:00 in LC 18. The film takes place in
Italy just prior to the start ofthe second world war
and shows the effects of Mussolrrir's anti—Semitic
edicts on two Jewish families. Dominique Sands
plays the young daughter on the I’rirzr-Contirrrs
family that retreats rrito the world of their walled
garden as the madness grows around them. And
there is Giorgio, who lives in the heart of the city
and tries to show the FinziL‘ontiriis the dangers in
closing themselves off from the world and ignoring
the danger.

Vittorio De Sica, one of the major powers in thc
ltaliari Neo~Rea|ism school of filmniakirrg, has made
a hauntingly beautiful film about the desperate
nature of love. De Sica has always been air uncom-
prorrrrsing artist and this film increases his already
peerless reputation. The Garden ofThe I"r‘rizr'-. .
Crrlrlinii' is a subtle and rewarding film well worth
your attention.

You must have noticed that Marx Brothers movies
always seem funnier when you see them with a
together audience. Instead of seeing 02 with only a
handful of people crowded around a small tv
screen, see it with five hundred other people who
grew up with Dorothy and the Wicked Witch of the
West. It promises to be quite an evening. The
Uptown branch of Emerald City is LC 18, Midnight,
Saturday the 7th.

On Saturday, April 7th, lIiG rnvitcs you to your

own childhood with a midnight screening of the
1939 classic The Wizard 0102 with Judy Garland,
Bert Lahr, Ray Bolgcr, Jack Haley, Frank Morgan
and Margaret Hamilton. I doubt there's anything
new I can tell you about the technicolor fantasy
that made Judy Garland a star at sixteen, birt I can
tell you not to stay away just because you‘ve seen 11
a dozen times on televrsion. A Midnight show has 11
certain Magic about it and a Midnight of The Wizard
ufOz. has rirore than the average amount of magic
tort.
