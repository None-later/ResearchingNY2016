by Mark Gilmour

Homer Bixby is the true ruler of Al-
bany State. He is a recluse; he lives in
a broom closet in the Mohawk Tower.
He- believes he’s the present incarnation
of HP. Lovecraft, and he's a vanilla ice
cream addict.

Friday night I came through the line-

in the dining hall. As I was putting my
tray down, a dude with a big black hat
and a green plaid blazer stepped up
beside me and touched my shoulder. I
recognised him as one of the hustlers
from the Campus Center Recreation
Room. “How come you ain’t taking
part in the Spaghetti Boycott?" he ask-
ed mediplomaticallyg. I noticed that
most of the people around me had
taken the meat sauce and not the mac-
aroni.

“I've joined the March for Starch,“ I
said, sitting down. "I have to eat a
loaf of bread every meal or the equiva-
lent in macaroni or potatoes...”

“You’re a dedicated man,” he said,
“but enough protocol!" He handed me
an envelope.

“Is it...is it from him?” I gasped.

“Yes. Yes, it’s from..Jlim," the hust-
ler said respectfully. He took off his
hat briefly as he said it. “I hope it’s
good news. I'd hate to see ya get the
boot. Many a swell game a B-ball we
had over to the QC,” he said, starting
away. “And there ain’t many suckers.
like you around no more. I can use a
fiver now and then..."

I opened the envelope. There was a
dirty scrap of legal paper inside with
some writing on it: "Bring ii box of
six Sealtest ice cream sandwiches to
the janitorial closet next to 21078 Mo-
hawk Tower within two hours or the
world will find out the truth about
you."

I couldn’t eat. I took my tray back
and buried down to Stuyvesant to buy

the ice cream. Back at Mohawk Tower
I took the elevator.

‘Homer wasn’t in his room. There
were only buffers and brooms and
Ajax cans and toilet paper in the clos-
et. The only sign that anyone lived
there was a tattered COPY of‘ Machi-
velli’s Prince, resting on a shelf over
the sink.

Homer came out of the elevator as I
stepped out into the hall again. He was
four feet ﬁve inches tall and he looked
like Mayor Richard Daley dressed up
like an auto mechanic. “Did you bring
the stuff?" he asked me.

“I did," I said meekly, holding out
the package.

“You’re not a lobbyist from the
Dairyman’s League?"

“No. No..."

“You're sister’s running for Miss Hol-
stein of Rockland County..."

“No. Not that either. No political
afﬁliations..." I tried to assure him.

“What do you mean no political afﬁl-
iations?" he cried, tearing the package
open.

“I don’t like to get mixed up in..."
“Don’t you live in the dorm...?"
"Yes."

""eople are searching your rooms
if '- there, taking all sorts of liberties,
gm  away with murder! They're [fir-
ing the teachers who're too active and
too good instead of the too poor and
the too ineffectual! They're raising
prices and dropping quality..!"

I‘d forgotten the March for Starch. “I
joined the March for Starch,” I said
meekly.

Homer was licking the ice cream out
of the sandwiches and throwing the
chocolate wafers away. “Go mutter for
peanut butter..." he said.

I was getting scared. I was worried
that he was going to tell the world the
truth about me.

"I have a mind to tell the world the
truth about you," he said, between
licks.

“I'll join the Grievance Committee!
I'll send letters to the Campus Coali-
tion!”

"Oh, you stand there with your cock
in your hand and you call yourself a
man..!" he sang, taunting me.

“Oh, please don’t tell them!" I plead-
ed. “Listen! Listen, I'll even go to S.A.
meetings!" I was desperate.

“What in hell would you do that for?
You want to solve the problems, not
contribute to the confusion..." Homer
ﬁnished the last of his vanilla and
threw the Sealtest box in a waste re-
ceptacle. He poked around in the clos-
et and came out shouldering a broom.

"Say," I thought to ask him, “you’re
the ruler of Albany State. What are
you doing about the problems down
there?"

“I just finished bufﬁng ithe whole.
22nd floor. I’m cleaning this campus
up top to bottom. 'I‘op ﬁrst..."

I felt a flow of admiration for my
leader. “You won't tell them, will
you?” I called after him, remembering.

“Just keep that ice cream coming!"
He passed around the corner, singing:
“Got you all doped with religion and
sex and TV..."

I pushed the elevator button. I rode
down to the lobby, relieved that I
could live on, undetected—undetected
and free. Only Homer and I would
know that I was u--Oh! Too horrible
for words-~a...agh...wasp.

did not have their contracts renewed,
in large part, sources say, because of
Quint’s style, and Hunsberger's support
of Quint. Most of these people, the
source adds, “left the department in
various degrees of alienation."

And the ones whose contracts were
not renewed were fired because “their
standards Were not high enough."

Students and faculty at U Mass also
explained that even faculty who were
leaving the department were “afraid to
speak out against injustices there."
Quint reportedly “harrassed” professors
and had, what one professor called,
“ridiculous standards.”

Hunsbergers resignation followed a
meeting between him an the faculty of
the history department, which was
called to discuss the proposed reap-
pointment of Potash as department
head. At that very tense session, Huns-
berger reportedly told the faculty that
he “was coming in good faith" to con-
sult the department concerning the ap-
pointment. However, according to stu-
dent newspaper sources at U Mass, Pro-
fessor Dean Ware stood up at the
meeting after Hunsberger had spoken,
and told the gathering that he had a
Xerox copy of a letter signed by Huns-
berger and U Mass President John
Lederle stating that in fact Potash had
already been recommended for a job.

It seems, then, that Hunsbcrger told
the department they would be con—
sulted after he had allegedly already
filed a recommendation in favor of
Potash, the man most of the depart-
ment opposed. Many professors in the
history department felt that l‘lunsbcrgcr
was not consulting them in good faith,
in spite of his assurances.

This, along with numerous additional
problems with other departments, ul-
timately led to Hunsbergcr's resigna-
tion. He said that he thought it would
be “in the best interest of the Univer-
sity" that he resign.

Letters to the Editor

Oust Hunsberger
To the Editor:

If the University seriously desires
to raise standards and to reward good
teaching it will immediately move to
dismiss I. Moyer Hunsberger from his
post as Dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences. Steps must also be taken
to remedy the damage he has already
done.

His judgments in the tenure cases of
Dennis Helmrich and Curtis Smith, and
more specifically his letter concerning
the case of Curtis Smith, are reason
enough to immediately ask his resigna-
tion.

One does not dismiss from the facul-
ty :1 pianist/teacher of the calibre of
Dennis Helmrich in the name of high
standards-It is a common judgment
among musicians that Dennis has the
highest ability. He is one of the Finest
young musicians in America. The local
reviews of his recitals alone make clear
that it is an honor for thc Univrrsity
In have him on the faculty. ’I‘hi-rc is
not the slightest possiblity of rcplacnig
him with someone better, or rcmoti-ly
as good. We are informed that unspi-c-
ificd objections have been made to his
grading policies. Presumably the Donn,
while knowing nothing of music, ob-
jccts to the shape of his bcll curve.

If the University system wants to fl"
ward good teaching, then it would bc
promoting Curtis Smith and not forcing
his departure. There is no fincr
teacher/critic on this campus, a fact
that the student evaluations Illilkt' [M‘r
fcclly Clcur. Dcan llunSIJI‘fﬂl'f‘s li-lli-r
makes ii farce of thc wholc system of
evaluation. The system was instituted
for the clear purpose of rewarding
good teaching. The Dean‘s lettcr is ill
once so arrogant and so stupid that il
approaches intentional dishonesty. ln
Dcan Hunsbcrgcr's mind good teaching
evaluations become an instrumi-nt for
punishing.

Normally-one pities mediocrity. But
when it is allied with gri'zit personal
arrogance and placed in a position of
power it must be cl'iallcngud.

$150 more in tuition per year than
underclassmen. Consequently, they
shou|d get ﬁrst pick in choosing cour-
ses.

However, when we turn to the pres.
ent system of upperclassmen getting
first choice of dorm rooms, we ﬁnd no
reason why these people are getting
first choice in the choice of dorm
rooms, since everyone pays the same
amount for room and board. Surely, it
is of a discriminatory nature since fed-
eral law prohibits discrimination on the
basis of race, sex, creed, and age. Un-
less the University can justify such ll
policy, and it is plain to see that it
can't, it should change the policy be
fore room contracts come out.

Harris Says It

To the Editor:

I do not want Sammy 'l‘homas' letter
regarding the present student uprising
in Greece to be understood as a popu-
lar stand among Grook»Americanii at
this school or anywhere else. Indeed,
Mr. 'I‘homas' article is u fasciltic in
nature as is the corrupt Junta strang-
ling the (heck people everyday. The
reason for the apparent, ‘lence in
Crook Univoniitics during the tter part
of the sixties was four - fear from re
prisalis. This iii not to underscore the
cfforlai of the American students, but
during the last six years in Greece
there is documented proof of revenge
being taken on friends and families of
“unruly” students, consisting of tho
cruelest tortures and even summarial
executions. ’l‘hc urcallcd awakening of
(in-alt students is not that at all. It in

expresion can be interpreted as “trea-

son." And all this in the place when-
democracy was founded.

As for the present economy which
Sammy defends, a closer look is war-
ranted. It is in most part benefiting the
already wealthy through tax exemp-
tions and corruption at all Icvcls of
business and government. It is th-
Onasiii' of Greece who own the airlines
and ships who are rot-king thi- gains.
The U.S. isn't faring too badly either
with a “home away from homc" for
the sixth fleet in the Mediterruncan. So
instead of calling (lrock students (or
American students) animals and barbar-
ians as Sammy would have it, let us
work with them in their struggle until
the dictatorship comcs tumbling down.
And BRAVO to thc A.S.l’. for speak-
ing out on issues of international ur-
goncy for people cvcrywhi-rc.
