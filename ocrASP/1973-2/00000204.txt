The Albany springs continued
their reputation for wetness as
the Albany State track team is
preparing to open the season this
weekend. Their first_ meet is an
away meet in New Paltz against
the home club and Oneonta.

The Danes, who lost for the
. first time in three years last year,
;‘ are being hampered by this rain.
The runners can still run in the
> iuruiels but the field competitors
 will be the ones hurt most. It is
Very similar to the indoor track

Track Team Seeks Successful Season

Open at New Paltz Saturday

club, where the tunnels were the
only facilitiy that could be used.

To continue the winning tradi-
tion Albany will have to expect
key performances front some re-
turnees. it is too early. at this
point, to tell if any youngsters
will be ready to make a contri.
bution.

The sprints will be in the hands
of two top returnees, Cliff
McCarg and Harvey Sobel.
McCatg ran the 60 yrd. dash

indoor and will probably run the
l00. He also will anchor the long
jump. Sobel is the top 220 man.
Both these guys should do the
job as long as they stay injury
free.

The middle distances show a
youngster named Bilasli and
Chuck Hower, Both ran indoors
and had very good years. Bill
Sore], a cross country man, may
also try his luck at the 880.
Sorcl did run the 1000‘ indoors
but the smaller distance might
hurt him.

The mile and two mile are
solid. Carlo Clierubino and Jim
Shrader, both cross-country runv
nets and botli ran indoors. Shra-
der is exceptionally strong and
prefers longer distances. Sorcl is
another one to be reckoned
with.

The shot pill and the discus are
iii the hands of Rudy Vida and
.lim Holloway. Rudy kept break.
ing his own record last year and
should continue to do so with
more experience. Holloway is
another big man who threw it

during the winter.

The jumps will feature McCarg
and Reynolds. Bothjumped dur-
ing the winter. McCarg was out-
standing in the long but he will
also be working on sprints. Dave
Reynolds is the school record
holder for the high jump and
also does the triple jump.

So the season will begin and
Albany is not accustomed to
losing seasons. Well, this one
should be no different, unless
Albany is crippled by injuries.

Once again pro-registration has
begun in the Colonial Quad U-
Lounge. A number of new pro-
cedures concerning registration
and the grading policy are being
implemented. These are as fol-
lows:

- The seniority system has
gone into effect, replacing the
alphabetical system. Under the
new system graduates will pre-
regtstcr first, followed by seniors
(88 or more credits), juniors
(So-87 credits), sophomores

(24-55 credits), freshmen (fewer

ting students and open.

— Under the seniority system
students will ro longer be desig-
nated by their class year. Rather,
they will be categorized by their
academic classifications. (Fresh-
men = FR, Sophomore = SO,
Junior = JR, Senior = SR). Class-
ifications are determined by
completed course credit infor-
mation on file at the end of
February.

— The grading system has
changed again. As of the Fall
I973 semester, an undergraduate
student may elect to be S/U

than 24 credits), non—matricula-

 
   

_ .............4 a.»~w«_

graded in any course which is
normally A-E graded. A maxi-
mum of 30 credits may be so
selected. Of these 30 credits, 6
credits may be in the major,
second field or a combination
thereof. In addition, a student
may register for any number of
courses designated by a depart-
ment for S/U grading in the
Schedule of Classes or its supple-
ments. The 30 S/U credits do
not include S/U credits received
before Fall, 1973.

The current pro-registration
period will be the first oppor-

tunity that an undergraduate
will have to indicate which
course or courses in his or her
Fall class schedule should be
authorized for S/U grading. An
other opnnrtunity to select S/U
courses (or change back to A-E
courses that had been selected as
S/U) will occur during the add-
drop period of the Fall semester.
The last day to add a course will

# Finally, next semester will
offer students an opportunity to
cross-register for courses at other
campuses within the area. The

participating institutions I are
SUNYA, Albany College of
Pharmacy, Fulton-Montgomery
Community College, Hudson
Valley Community College. Im-
