Washington D.C. Demands
End of Colonial Status

Press Release from the League of
Wtiiiieii Voters

The Nation‘s capital will see an
end to its colonial status before
the Bicentennial in 1976, if the
League of Women Voters and
the Coalition for Self-Deter-
mination for D.C. can arouse
citizen respome.

756,000 citizens of our capital
still are unable to elect local
govemment ofﬁcials. In the Dis-
trict of Columbia. President
Nixon appoints the Mayor
Commissioner and the City
Cauncil. These ofﬁcials are
answerable to the President, not
to the District citizens.

The District of Columbia has
no Representatives in Congress,
eVr-i though its population is
greater than that often states.
Our Congressman. Carleton
King. who has other important
duties. must be concerned wtth
local district affairs such it:
determining the registration for
for dogs in DC. or (leading:
whether kites may be flown
there.

It Will take a hill by Congress

to provide locally elected of-
ﬁcials and control of local taxes
and affairs. A Constitutional
Amendment must be passed by
2/3 of the members of both
houses of Congress and by 3/4
of the State Legislatures to allow
D.C. to have representation in
Congres.

We believe that if voters of this
nation realize the great unfair-
ness of imposing all duties of
citizenship on the residents of
Washington while denying them
the rights of every US. voter
living elsewhere. they will ask
their Congressman to support
home rule and Congresssional
Representation for the District
of Columbia.

Opinion:

A Curt Smith Defense

Opinion by Barry Davis

Fellow students I am fed up
with what we mean to this uni-
versity. For most of us the rea-
son we are here is to learn.
Outstanding teaching in my
"naieve" opinion facilitates
learning. I say naieve because
that is not the position of many
administration figures at this in-
SlIUilon,

It seems to me if we meant
something to IIIIS university the
prime goal here would he in
cdut‘utc us and to find the lit-st
pL’UPIL' in help us become
learned This universin hclixivcs

Curt. we are told. is not a good
enough scholar. His MarXist Clill-

He hasn‘t published enough and
he hasn't published in the right
