MOUGlNS, FRANCE

lcy rain fell on the Riviera
home of Pablo Picasso all day
Monday as his family met in
seclusion to discuss funeral
arrangements for the century’s
most influential artist.

His son Paulo, appearing at the
gate of the villa to let in mem-
bers of the family, told newmen
nothing had been decided.

“There is nothing deﬁnite
yet,“ said Paulo. “You know.
the death of my father causes
problems."

He refused to speak at length
with newsman at the closely
guarded gate. But authoritative
sources confirmed earlier reports
ﬁltering out of the villa that the
family wanted a private funeral,
perhaps away from the Cannes
area.

Paulo, son of Picasso’s first
wife, Olga, refused to explain
what he meant by problems sur-
rounding Picasso's death.

The painter died Sunday at age
9] from a heart attack and fluid
in the lungs. His body lay in a

Armand Anteby, Picasso’s
business manager and an attor-
ney, indicated to newmen that
Picasso had left no will directing
the disposal of thousands of
paintings, worth perhaps mil-
lions of dollars, stored in various
rooms in the villa.

Son Paulo, 52, arrived at the
villa late Sunday. He joined the
painter's widow Jacqueline, 47,
and her daughter Catherine by a
previous marriage.

Picasso‘s three illegitimate
children, known to have been on
uneasy terms with Jacqueline,
did not come to Mougins, They
were his daughter Maya, born of
his liaison with Marie Therese
Walter. and a son, Claude. and a
second dailgl.ter, l’aloms, born
of his liaison with French artist
Francoise Gillot.

The villa “contains a greater
wealth in modern paintings than
most of thw world‘s museums,"

said one friend of the family.
“Picasso collected not only his
own paintings but those of his
greatest contemporaries, inclu-
ding Matisse, Modigliani, and
Braque. The house is an artistic
gold mine."

Picasso kept up his. intense
artistic activity to the very end
of his life and was still painting
in the early hours of the morn
ing of the day he died.

'The only insider to talk to
mwsrmn at the- gate was Picasso‘s
Italian born gardener, Jacques
Barra. Visibly moved and shak-
ing with emotion, Barta said he
was allowed to enter the dead
man's room to embrace liiiri for
the last time.

“He is dressed in a gray suit
and is lying on his bed sur-
rounded by white gladiolas,"
Barra said. “He has a peaceful
expression on his face as though
he were asleep."

Communications Report Cites - lsolation

Cont'd from front page

.
When asked who would be re-
sponsible if both the President
and Executive VP were absent,
those interviewed expressed in-
consistant answers or none at all.
Tire writers noted that the situa-
tion can be “relatively simple to
correct," going on to mention
that Dr. Tompkins, who was
involved in a similar study at
Kent State prior to the May
l970 crisis, “had observed un-
fortunate effects of such con—
fusion during a time of crisis."

The second problem facing the
administration and its effect in
“slowing, delaying, and con-
fusing" members of the SUNYA
community was described as
“layer'ism.” More than a third of
those talked to in the adminis-
tration felt that, “The system
suggests procrastination to
people. becausc there are so
many steps you wonder how
anything gets done,"

The final most frequently men-
tioned communication problem
was the “absence of clearly artic-
ulatcd organizational goals." The
bulk of this criticism rests on the
shoulders of President Louis
Bette/ct. One Vice-President
said. “There is no common set
of goals articr'lated by the Presi-
dent or anyone else." Ari assist-
ant to the l’resrdcnt remarked,
"It there are clearly defined
goals. they have not been spelled
out for me. There aren't any
tlcar goals. That is one of the
icer communication problems of
lllt’ llriivcisily."

llic group involved in the re-
port. in Iesponsc to repeated
gr lL'\’ttlIL'L'S concerning university
goals. requested from l’rcsrdcnt
llciic/ct a list of goals he be-
lieved he should promote as the
chief adriiiriistrator of SUNYA.
'l licy were as follows

the university communi

ity and interests of students who
are admitted to the State Univer-
sity at Albany.

To establish and reconcile our
missions as a university center of
top quality in undergraduate ed-
ucation, graduate education, and
research."

The interviewers threw in an
additional five fictional goals
and questioned those interview-
ed as to which they interpreted
to be Bcnezets. Among the five
ﬁctional goals were, “to en»
courage the faculty at SUNYA
to spend more time and effort
on research and publication."
Another one was, “to raise ad-
mission standards to the point
where only the ublCSl students in
the state wrrl be admitted to the
university."

Only PM of all the people
questioned selected Benezet‘s
five goals perfectly. Only 3% of
the students identified the goals
accurately. This indicates a clear
failure on thc part of the I’rcst-
dent to make known his ideas
and hopes to members outside
the Administration burlding.

When those questioned were
informed as to Benelct's five
original goals, the team discover»
ed that there cxrstcd wtde ac-
ceptance supporting the Prcsi»
dcrit, The rcport citcs. “were
these goals of l’ic'stdcnt Berle/ct

frequently and widely" circula-
ted, a better understanding of
the administration and greater
cohesiveness in this university
would occur. That initiative, the
report noted, “must be taken by
the President."

When members ofthe adminis-
tration were questioned as to
what were inc least credible
sources of communication on
this campus, The Albany Slu-
dent Press won hands down.

Out of the twelve deans that
were involved in the study, one
half felt that an administrative
manual describing procedures
and routine instructions was
lacking, a third felt that they

of them claimed to be isolated
from the administration. Again,
the lack of university goals was
frequently criticized and over
half felt that there was too little
face to face communication on

campus.

The report also noted that
there was dissatisfaction with
the Bookstore, the registrars
office, and the library although
only a minority of faculty men-
tioned all three as problem areas.

When faculty members were
asked what they considered to
be the least credible sources of
communication at SUNYA. the
ASP was again heading the list

to be complacency on the stu-
dent's part, the study still
proved to reveal some problems.
it found that students had little
knowledge of the procedures in~
volved and people delegated to
handle specific problems. They
did find that 57% felt isolated
from the administration (some
students preferring it that way.)
There was one noteworthy find-
ing that illustrated differences
between students and the rest of
the university. The report says.
“Administrators may be sur-
prised lo learn that their least
credible source is the students‘
rriost credible source-- the Al-
bany Student Press. "

What does the study say'.’ It
says that We bulk of this univer-
sity's members feel alienated
from their administration, That
certain problems Will always re-
main but sortie can be corrected
and should be corrected. It calls
on the President to acknowledge
his rcsporisrbility to. not just
administration members. but all
members of this community.
And perhaps most important. ll

 

were not being sufficiently con»
sullcd before Significant decis-
ions were made. When the deans
were questioned as to what were
the credible sources of corti-
rnuncration on tlirs campus, the
Albert y Student Press once again
surtaccd as the least credible. It

"The system suggests procrastination

to people, because there are so
many steps you wonder how

anything gets done. "

 

 

 

may be important to note that
the first criticism coricernrng an
administrative manual. may in
large part be due to the relative-
ly short time several deans had
to faiiiiltarize themselves wrtli
their new jobs. Seven of them
had been in their rob for less
than a year and a hall.

0ch seventy faculty members
were included in the study. llalf

“After sevena \cars of hearing
studcril snoi'ts and demands. it
may come as a surprise to the
reader that our sample of 133
students had fewer complaints

the study."

llowcvci.dcspitc what appears

risks that we as an academic
community fully understand the

cation. In regards to tcclirigs of
