By Phineas Israeli/AFS

The Best and the Brightest,
David Halberstam‘s highly-
touted study of the men who
planired and executed the war in
Vietnam. is sadly a case of the
book which could have been. It
is sadly so. for Halberstam
trpparently did the legwork but
not the soul-searching requisite
for the task. As a result he
produced a best-seller but blew
his opportunity to educate the
American public about the true
depravity; of our government.

The flaws in this book can be
diagrarnmed as a set of contra-
dictions, beginning with the title
itself. by which Halberstam
promises to convey the mon-
strous irony of the war, that this
genocidal policy was produced
by the so-called cream of Ameri-
can society. Yet it is this very
irony with which Halberstam
never fully comes to grips. He
opens the door and moves to the
edge of the abyss, exposing
McNamara. Rusk, Bundy,etc. as
a paranoid. schizophrenic and
super-machismo lot (the evr-
deuce which l-lalberstarn has
compiled for this portrait is well-
-rrrglr massive, btit for a sarriplc
there rs the spectacle of Lyndon
Johnson dismissing a war critic
as a man who "has to squat to
piss." and telling an associate
alter the (julf of Tonkin Reso-
lrrrrou and arr strikes, “I didn‘t
just screw l'lo (‘hi Mrnh. l cut his
pecker off "

But then. as if unable to bear
the truth of the American sys-
tcrn. Halberstam turns away
from history and from lllL' stark-

 

ness of his own revelations, and
ascribes the war to til: “nistﬂtes”
of the decision-makers, leaving
in the wake of his lurid disclo-
sures the ludicrously pale im-
pression that these men were
indeed so bright and so success-
ful that they could not conceive
of failure, and therefore made a
foolish war, but if they’d only
known!

To understand how Halber-
stam entangles his title and his
theme in such a web of liberal
ambiguity, it is necessary to con-
sider the contradiction of his
method which is that of at-
tempting to simultaneously
write an “inside” account of
Washington decision-making vis
a vis the war, and a deﬁnitive
history of those decisions. The
revelations which Halberstam
makes are indeed fascinating to
read (for sheer callousncss it is
hard to beat Dean Rusk agreeing
to the bombing of North Vict-
riam with the remark, "In for a
dime, in for a dollar.") Yet the
contradiction between writing
an “inside” and a deﬁnitive
account ultimately leaves the
book high and dry, good in the
parts for which the author got
people to talk, weak in the parts
for which he has nojurcy quotes
or special information, but iri-
sists on writing as if he did have
tlicrri.

The distorting effects which
such a method cart produce are
underscored in the dctailsofthc
book, Daniel Iillsbcrg, for ex-
ample, lS mentioned in the nar<
rativc Sixteen different times,
thus givnig an exaggerated View

of Ellsberg’s role in events,
whereas the entire Council on
Foreign Relations, that institu-
tion through which the needs
and designs of Wall Street are
translated into the substance of
American foreign policy, is men-
tioned only seven times (David
Rockefeller, probably the most
powerful man in the American
Establishment, and the closest
approximation of an American
Caesar, is not mentioned once).
To fully account for the failure
of this book, however, it is most
important to note how the con-
tradiction in method becomes a
contradiction in content. Halber-
stam's great strength as a politi-
cal journalist is his feel for the
way in which the grid of a
bureaucracy lights up to make
decisions--the way individuals
“handle” each other, suspect,
maneuver and ultimately despise
each other, acting all the while
to protect their own positions
and prestige on the "inside" of
power. This feel for what Hal-
bcrstam calls “the Play" in tan—
dem with his revelations of the
statements of “the Players" them-
selves, is potentially a kind of

goldmine for informing the
American people about what our
government is really like.

The vagueness and inadequacy
of Halberstam's analysis of the
war is eloquently demonstrated
by the conspicuous lack of elo-
quence and explanation with
which he concludes the book.
Discussing Nixon's continuation
and expansion of the war in
Southeast Asia as a “step by step
repetition of the mistakes ofthe
past," the author concludes,
“There was, Americans were
finding, no light at the end of
the tunnel, only darkness." But
without probing the deeper
why‘s and wherefores, the facts
of Amariuin political economy, the
resources and strategic position
of Southeast Asia, etc., Halber-
stam looks through the telescope
backwards, mistaking the way in
which the Washington bureau-
cracy operates for the meaning
and purposes of its operations. It
is as if the author gave no
reﬂection to the inherent diffi-
culties of writing "inside"
accounts--- that they ultimately
accept the ideological assump-
tions of the edifice being peric-

-The Besz‘ and the Brigh res

hated-«and hence the distortion
ensues, the war emerges as a set
of “mistakes” of the players,
whereas the structure of the
Anierlcan system, in which and
for which the ‘principles’ are
‘playing,’ remains essentially in-
visible.

Thus, the ironies of the title
are finally paid off at the ex-
pense of the book, the joke is on
Halberstam himself. Setting out
to explain how the ‘finest' male
representatives of the Amqrican
elite could not perceive the futilv
ity and the evil of their war
policy, Halberstam becomes im-
mersed in his own quagmire of
vagueness, ambiguity and un-
reality. For once conceding the
leaders of the Kennedy and
Johnson Administrations their
‘brilliancc' and their ‘qualities.~
he can explain neither their ‘fail-
urc' to l‘orego the war. nor
Nixon‘s perpetuation of tlic
same. Halberstam's flaw is, at
the botton, his basic inability to
perceive or accept the nature of
the American system, which pro-
duces and is subservient to such
men as the subjects of The Best
and the Brightest.

New album by Kottke

by Bill Brina

Leo Kottkc has been touring
with John McLaughlin quite a
bit lately, which is king of ﬁt-
ting, because they actually share
a good deal in common. They
are both brilliant, totally unique
guitarists and they are both ori-
ginal personalities. Most im-
portantly, both of them exist
independently of the standard
categories of the music business,
and so both are forced to create
their own markets. John has
done this quite spectacularly of
late, and now it looks like Leo
may ﬁnally be ready to make

Psychokinesis and the Press

by Saul-Paul Sirag
Alternative Features Service

There is a fantastic tug-ot‘war
going on between Time maga-
zine and Stanford Research
Institute about psychokinesis, of
all things. Don’t think it’s a
small war. The struggle is over
Uri Geller, the man “who can
make clocks run backward," and
the foundations of the powerful
are shaking.

Uri Geller, a 26-year old Israeli
linguist, has under closely con-
trolled laboratory conditions
demonstrated his ability to
change matter in scientifically
inexplicable ways — such as:
bending metal, disappearing met-
al, creating fractures in metal,
repairing fractures in metal, ru-
pairing torn-up leaves - all in a
matter of seconds. This was thr-
bombshEIl that Andrija
Puharich, an MD. who lttts
studied psychics for 25 years,
and Geller for the past IH
months, threw to a large nudiv
once at a para-psychology
symposium at U.(J. Berkeley on
March the ‘1 th.

Two days later 'I‘intr' Magazine
came out on the stands with an
article accusing Geller of fraud.
They also bitterly attacked lllt‘
Stanford Research Institute and
smeared the physicists, Harold
l’uthoff and Russell ’I‘arg, who
checked out Uri (lellor and
found him genuine. I say
"smeared" because “Inc does
not havu much ofa scientific leg
to stand on.

The Department of [)nl'r-rrsr-,
which funds most of SRI [‘1‘
search, brought in two psycholo
gists to give opinions about the
methodology of the (it‘llt'i‘ rt'
search, One cquivocatt-rl, and rbr-

Meanwhile “file‘s editors had

suggestions. Then further re-
search was carried out. Puthoff
and Targ will present their re—
sults to the public on March the
9th at Columbia.

Time really jumped the gun.
And if anyone was sloppy it was
[one because they were overly
impressed with Geller's reseme
blance to a stage magician. True,
(loller is a showman, and has
demonstrated his abilities on
many stages, especially in Israel
and Germany (where he stopped

fail-safe" cable car system.)
But Geller, in these shows, can
make a silvrrr dollar disappear,
and come back a few minutes
later bent in half. Sure, he has

this can happen only if the

Perhaps Time really believes
more than it is letting on. Time
has clearly tried to create news

knew that the public disclosure:
