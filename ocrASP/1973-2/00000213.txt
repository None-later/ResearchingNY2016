CrawlingAmqul presented in
Experimental Theatre's closing

Jules Feiffer satire ending with a
successfully exciting twist.
Cleverly introduced ttt a jazz era

twenties. But vCrarvlt'IrgArnuId
occurs in tire near future with its
own type of decadence. it is a

Dlttlitg the air raid drill the cast

ran min‘dlessly around tlte stage
thus losing the essential delight
these characters derive from
panic. Some of Mrs. Enterprise‘s
litres could easily have been
Edith Burtker’s. but we only saw
sturelied lace and so lost the
essential comedy that the script
demands. The satire of the
American family ittlrerertt in
Mrs. Enterprise was buried urtder
lter over-postured formality.
However, this point was not
totally buried. Molaitt Gilmore‘s
loud. shuffling souctant porv
trayal of the house servant was
set just right. Her character-
izatiort slid perfectly into the
scrrpt's ltavirtg her reverse the
