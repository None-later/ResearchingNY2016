“Close ones are always good
ones to win"--Coach Munsey.

Clutch performances were the
key in the track team’s double
victory over Oneonta and host
New Paltz in the season opener
last Saturday. The contest was as
close as the 84%—78‘/r18 final
score, with Oneonta garnering
second place.

When a team can come up with
ten personal bests and two
school records in an opening
meet, you are looking at a Squad
of classy, clutch performers. In
their brief existence, the track-
sters have compiled an impres-
sive overall record of 38-6, and
have beaten 35 of their last 36
opponents. The 1973 squad cer-
tainly has their work cut out for

 

them if they are to extend the
present seven meet win streak, as
injuries have taken their toll
early in the season. Saturday's
win, however, makes the next
few weeks a little brighter.
Coach Munsey had made seve-
ral estimates which predicted
Oneonta as a one point victor.
Twenty-eight men, led by ctr
captains Sal Rodriguez, Cliff
McCarg, and Rudy Vido, proved
that Munsey is a poor bookie
(which is OK in this case).
McCarg, in the coach’s words,
was the “superman of the day."
In the trials of the 100 yardt
dash, he led all. qualifiers in tying
the school record of 9.7 seconds.
Cliff later won the ﬁnals in 9.9 .
In between, the Albany senior
anchored the 440 relay team to

BROADEN YOUR
CAREER OPTIONS

Do you know that of 200 thousand people in the
United States who make in excess of $100,000
per year salary, 70% of them are graduates of the

American industry regards
ROTC program graduates who elect to pursue a
civilian career as highly desirable, top-level pros-
pects, because of their management and leadership
exposure through ROTC?

Do you know that ROTC provides management in
dozens of career fields and opens up substantially
increased opportunities for executive employment
at salaries starting at $10,000 annually Iollowmg
graduation? (The options stay open until you
complete a Masters or Law degree if you prefer)

You should know these things. You should also
know of a program now available for SUNY stu
dents to satisfy ROTC requirements in 2 years,
during school for only 4 hours per week. At
Siena College all 2 year students draw $100 per
month for each month's participation Class times
are arranged to meet your schedule.

To qualify you must be completing your sopho-
more year in college, have a minimum 2.5 aver-
age, and attend a 6 week summer session (all
expenses paid plus $460.80 pocket money).

a second place ﬁnish by making
up a 16 yard deﬁcit in 110 yards
and won the long jump, an event
he rarely practices. As if that
wasn't enough, McCarg led the
220 dash to personally match
New Paltz’s team score. Harvey
Sobel placed in both sprints and
showed signs of regaining last
year's form.

Rodriguez, the school record
holder in the quarter, and frosh
Tim Bilash ran into tough com-
petition in that event and placed
second and third. Both ran fine
early season times and the Dane
coach has pegged the duo as the
new “golddust twins". Both
Bilash and frosh half-miler Tom
Crowley were robbed of better
performances by tactical mis-
takes due to inexperience.

Steady field events performers
came through once again with
needed points. Senior Dave Rey-
nolds did his usual scoring by
placing in the high jump and
winning the triple jump. John
Streeter placed behind Hound in
the triple and also took second
to an impressive Oneonta fresh-
man in the intermediate hurdles.
Streeter, the defending SUNY-
AC champ, was close to his own
school record, and Coach Mun-
sey feels that he can run well
below this mark by the end of
the season.

Rudy Vido led the shot men as

Track'T‘eom Wins; Mchrg & Shrader Star

they took three of the ﬁrst four-
spots; Paul Guttman and “Tiny”
Holloway finished second and
fourth. Guttman also won the
discus throw and was the reci-
pient of the team's “ﬁckle feath-
er" award for an excellent Dane
debut. Bob Malone picked up
points in the high hurdles and
high jump; also scoring in the
jumps were Jan Giga and Mike
Okurily. Lee Kardas and Tom
Moore finished third in the hur-
dles and javelin respectively,
while Tom Horn. took fourth in
the pole vault.

In this observer’s opinion, the
distance men stole the show.
The months of practice out in
the Albany winter weather pay-
ed off as each man recorded
personal bests. The Dane milers
took second, third, and fourth in
their event with Bill Sorel
(4126.5) leading Jim Shrader
(4227.2) and Rich Hower
(4228.6) across the line. These
times are all within six seconds
of the school standard. Sorel
came back an hour later to take
third in the half mile, narrowly
missing the two minute barrier
with in 2200.7 clocking.

A perfect end to the distance
machine’s performance came in
the two mile. Nick DeMarco,
who joined the squad last week,
replacing injured freshman Carlo
Cherubino, surprised just about

everybody with a 9:45 second
place finish. He was closely fol-
lowed by Curt Woodcock, who
clipped 30 seconds off his pre-
vious best in a fourth place 9:61
effort. Coach Munsey was im-
pressed with both performances,
which are among the top six
times by Albany runners in this
event.

Jim Shrader, however, was def-
initely the star. In talking to him
before the meet, Jim had hoped
to better his personal best, but
was unsure of the strength he
would have left after the mile.
As far as I could see, there was
plenty of juice left in the Mid-
dleburg junior as Shrader broke
Brian Quinn’s 9:35 school rec-
ord by 24 seconds with u 9:1].‘1
clocking. Coach Munsey called
this the classiest Dane perfor
manee ever, and when question-
ed as to how fast Shrader might
be able to go when he is pressed
by stiffer competition, Munsey
commented “after today, who
knows.”

Tomorrow the tracksters host
RPl at 3 pm. The natural rivalry
between the two schools, espec-
ially in the two running sports,
prompted an RPI captain to
comment two years ago: “When
we get together, it will always be
a good meet, because we hate
State's guts." Be there.

Is Albany’s Present Gym Sufficient?

by Nathan Salant

Have you ever visitied the
Phys. Ed. building during the
year, and found the basketball
courts empty? If you have,
you were quite lucky.

Have you ever wanted to go
down and play tennis, only to
have your plans ruined by the
weather? Have you ever tried
using the numerous outdoor
basketball courts during the
Winter (November to April)?
Have you ever wanted to get a
good running workout in, only
to find the track off limits, or
snow covered?

Have you been "fortunate"
enough to take a tennis course
and hit the ball off the gym
walls for 50 minutes, twu days
a week? Isn't jogging around
the auxiliary gym a wonderful
workout, and the “best” place
to hold our jogging classes?
Don’t you enjoy being stuck
inside and doing nothing in
your outdoor activity classes
when the weather does not co-
operate?

Have you ever been fortunate
enough to visit Potsdam Col-
lege, a college of approximate-
ly 4,000 students? Have you
seen their Phys. Ed. complex
with its: Hockey arena seating
several thousand; swimming
arena seating 1,500: numerous
basketball courts, and main
varsity court scating double
the school's total enrollment.
indoor softball fields; indoor

tracks, etc? If not, perhaps
you have seen Cortland.
another small school, or Platts-
burgh, which is even smaller,
yet hosted the Collegiate
Olympics.

Have you ever asked the
question: Why don‘t we have
those facilities? After all, we
only have 10,000 more
students than Potsdam, and a
fraction of its facilities.

Naturally, your next question
is: Why didn’t the gentlemen
who planned this university al‘
low for more areas for activi-
ties? The fuel. is that they did.
Are you aware of the fact that
the plans for this university
called for a multipurpose Field
house, seating several thousand
more people than our gym?

Now you ask, where is this
field house I spcak of? Perhaps
you will l)l’L‘()m(' upset when i
tell you that it is still in thr-
plans, still on the drawing
board. Perhaps you will be-
come cvcn more upset when l
tell you that well ovcr
$l,f)(ll),()f)().()l) has been spent,
and apparently wasted, on
clearing and preparing land for
that non-existent ficld housc.

Now that I havv hopefully
gotti-ii you upst-l. lcl. mc aggra-
vatc you t'W'Il more by rc-
minding you of the night
“f the Allinaii l5rolhcrs (Ton
ccrt, which was hcld at grczit
financial loss, thanks to llic

relatively tiny seating capacity
of the Palace Theater. If we
had that field house, with esti-
mated capacity for 10,000
People for concerts, at least
7,000 more students or out-
siders could have seen that
concert, which may very well
have at least broken even ﬁ-
nancially.

I ask you: How long can the
university community tolerate
this ludicrous situation? When
will people begin taking action
to provide us with the neces-
sary facilities for the many ac-
tivities l have mentioned?

Just think of the many uses
we could make for that field
house.

Phys, Ed. courses would havo
a place to work in. Varsity
teams would have a place to
practice when it ruins or
snows, Albany State could
easily afford to have many
more speakers like Ralph
Nader with the largest indoor
structure in the 'I‘ri-city area.
There could be more concerts,
thanks to the money we might
make on renting out the field
hoiisc to local ligih schools for
their basketball championships
and other admission activities.
If an activity filled the field
house, and the university got
NW: of the gate, student assoA

to become more responsive to
student activities, and :perhaps
their budgets would be in-
creased, thanks to the new
revenues. Who knows -- may-
be, since it would be state
funded, we could attract an
ABA or WHA club to play
here. We could deﬁnitely in-
crease the number of intra-
mural sports being played,
thanks to the areas this filled
house would provide, and such
things as intramural tennis
would not be rained out. The
possible uses, as you can see,
are huge.

The time has come for ac-
tion, and a proposal is on the
desk of the proper authority
for the formation of :1 Phys.
Ed. based Activity Facility De-
velopment Committee. This
committee hopes to receive of-
ficial status within the very
near future, and to begin
drawing up plans for that field
house which we are owed!
However, the committee will
need support. and plenty of it.
If the university community
does not bolster the efforts of
this group, it may fail, and we
will remain in the disgraceful
situation we now suffer with.

If your Phys. Ed. courses are
being ruined by the monsoons,
and you want to prevent this
from re-occurring next ‘year,
the committee needs your

“a NI in." H...‘( Um i.i..gi.v..ii.vy,l'.i

help. If you are one of the
thousands who play intramural
sports, and you want to play
more games, a ﬁeld house,
which will increase the number
of available courts, is just what
you want, and should ﬁght
for. The committee needs the
complete support of the con-
cert board, so that we can
have more, and ﬁnancially suc-
cessful, concerts. Support is es-
sential from all cultural groups
who seek space for visiting lec-
turers and speakers, and who
find themselves hopelessly
crammed into the lecture halls.

Toall of those Great Dane
fans who supported our team
this winter, how would you
like a seat for the big games,
like the one versus Brockport?
If so, the committee must hear
from you.

If you share my feelings on
any of the above issues, the
committee desperately needs
you to: call, write, or visit Mr.
Merlin Hathaway on the third
floor of the Phys. Ed. build-
ing; write to myself, care of
the ASP sports department, or
letters to the ,cditor; call, visit,
or write to Lloyd Fishman,
President of AMIA, the AMIA
Office, and AMIA Council
members. The committee will
do the work -— if you show
your support!!!!!ll
