Elkin & Fishman Discuss AMIA's Situation

by Bruce Maggin

Recently the budget Committee at SUNYA recommended that AMIA‘s submitted
budget be cut by more than $3,000. With this in mind, last Friday ‘I talked with AMlA
advisor Denny Elkin and AMIA president Lloyd Fishman to get an overview of AMlA
and find out why they felt that the budget cuts were drastic.

ASP: What is the basic appeal of AMlA?

Fishman: We try to appeal to the average student to come out and recreate.

ASP: How many people participate in AMlA?

Elkin: Last year 4,120 athletes took part in AMIA activities. We have no way of
knowing how many individual students take part in AMIA. This year we estimate that
approximately 5,000 athletes will participate in AMIA sports. This does not include
spectators and ofﬁcials involved in each activity.

ASP: How many sports does AMIA have?

Elkin: There are 19 sports that a student at Albany can take part in including Flag
football, Soccer, Cross-Country, Bowling, Golf, Wrestling, Basketball, Handball, Squash,
Swimming, Volleyball and Softball.

ASP: What sport is most popular?

Elkin: Team-wise basketball with 110. Softball has the most students involved with
1,306 taking part last year.

ASP: Can anyone participate in AMIA‘.’

Elkin: Anyone who pays student tax can compete. We don’t require anyone to take a
physical. According to AMIA’s consitution, which was printed in 1947, this organiza-
tion is for men only. Last year, the AMlA council recommended that it might be a good
idea to allow girls to compete. Right now girls are participating in volleyball, bowling,
swimming, and softball. They are not permitted to compete in contact sports, in the
ease of the Jockettes (women's AMlA softball team) we were not trying to discourage
them from competing in AMIA. We only felt that the Jockettes Would rather compete
in League Ill but just missed the meeting. Right now they are competing in Mague 1.

ASP: Who really runs AMIA'.’

Elkin: This is sort of a tricky question. It's really a combination of the AMlA Council
and myself. I don't make any of the decisions. I just advise the council. I am the
University’s representative. The AMlA Council is composed of 14 members with one of
these spots left open for incoming freshmen. They determine all policies. The three
most important members on the council are the chairman of the officials committee,
treasurer and Lloyd, the president.

ASP: Why did the budget for AMlA get cut?

Fishman: The big reason is the people on the budget committee and Central Council
on the whole are not AMlA participants and do not know how we operate.

Elkin: It's all part of the idea of mass programming.

ASP: Where were the cuts'.’

Elkin: The toughest cut came in the area of our Student Assistants. Next year the
budget committee recommended that the total salaries of our four assistants should be
cut from $4,000 to $1,600 or 80 cents an hour. These four student .tants must
cover a Vast area because there are so many games going on at the same time on many
different fields. All of these students must be mature, responsible and people you can
trust. To pay them 80 cents an hour would be ridiculous.

Fishman: The budget committee and Central Council are jealous of the salaries that
the student assistants make. 'I'hey complain that the assistants make more money
(3800) than SA president Mike Lampcrt ($700). They don’t say anything about the
power and prestige that they have.

The other big cut in the budget is that ol' the referees. The budget committee feels
that we are paying our officials too much. Right now we are paying our referees in
basketball and softball $2.50 and $2.00 a game and in football $2.75 and $2.25 a game.
i don't feel that we are really ovarpaying our officials. Over the summer I umpire games
in the Stan Musial baseball League and I get $13 a game. The budget committee feels
that our refs should want to do it for the enjoyment but who wants to rcf a game on a
Saturday morning in the rain.

Elkin: I think we pay our refs a fair dollar and even then they don't always show up.
We can't function without refs. We haVe to make the salary appealing enough so people
will want to show up.

The salaries for the student assistants and for referees comprise $9,500 of our budget
of $10,400. The money we pay goes right back into the hands of students.

ASP: What is the future of AMlA'.’

Elkin: if we had the money We can expand. One sport which Would definitely be
implemented is three-on-threc basketball. ()llier sports that i like to see are one-on-oiie
basketball. indoor floor hockey. watt-r polo, bike rallies, and Men a boxing tournament.
But the big key is money.

The money and the facilities we have no way compares to many other schools. Iwent
to an intramural convention and it's depressing when you compare budgets and facilities.
We couldn't even publish our freshmen handbook and a school like Buffalo University is
able to publish four separate books. To give an example of how far intramurals have
progressed at some schools: Nassau County Community College even has intramural sky
diving.

ASP: What about the facilities here?

Elkin: During the winter, we are working with 110 basketball teams and only twa
courts. The only free time in the gym in the winter is before 3 o'clock and Gym C.
Between P.E. classes, the varsity teams and the intramural basketball teams, the gym is
used all of the time.

Compared to other schools we are behind again in facilities. Smaller schools like
Potsdam, Cortland and Plattsburgh have their own field house. Many school intramural
associations haVe been able to bUild their own facilities.

ASP: What about the student who just wants to shoot baskets on ii Friday night?

Elkin: There is no place for people like that. At the beginning of the year they
couldn't even get equipment. What this school needs is a person to coordinate a
recreation program.

ASP: How did AMIA do in the student association poll'.’

Fishman: We fared pretty poorly. Basically the people who voted are student
association oriented.

ASP: Any final comments?

Elkin: There is a demand on campus for an organized athletic program for the aVcrage
student. AMlA is that program.

We submitted a budget that is not padded. We need every cent listed for equipment,
student assistants and referees.

Analysis of the AMlA situation: The purpose of the new budget submitted is mass
programming (cuts in smaller clubs). This in itself can be questioned but if AMlA is not
a mass activity of this uniVersity, i don't know what is. One can just look at the athletic
fields each day to realize the great extent of this program. The budget cut is uncalled for
and completely ridiculous. 'l‘he liudgetcommittte is completely insensitive to the needs
of many Albany students. If anything, more money should be appropriach to make the
program on par with most universities.

it might not be too late to stop this slash in the budget. Central Council still has to
apprch the budget. If AMlA can go into Central Council with the names of as many
students as possible requesting that the budget cuts be restored, maybe our
representatives will see that AMlA is a vital part of this university. But you as a student
must become involved. The best way is to send your letters to me or the AMlA office, if
you don't have time to write a letter, lam enclosing a form at the bottom of this article
Just fill in your name and your ID number and check that you want the budget cuts
restored. Please bring all your forms or letter to the ASP officc or the AMlA office.

If you just sit back and let the other guy fill out the form and you do nothing, then
maybe next year there Won't be any intramurals to play.

l. Moyer Hunsberger, Dean of
SUNYA’S College of Arts and
Sciences, seems to be a man
unable to escape his problems.

Formerly Dean of the Arts and
Sciences College at the Universi-
ty of Massachusetts at Amherst,
Hunsberger is encountering
many of the same kinds of an-
iagonisms, misunderstandings,
and poor departmental relations
that plagued him while at the
Massachusetts college:

-r There are the numerous resig-

    

hy Al Scnia
News Analysis

nations among faculty who find
it difﬁcult to work with him.
During the past two years three
department chairmen have
stepped down, an associate dean
has left, and several other profes-
sors have been forced out.
—There are the critics, both
vocal and publicly silent, who
are raising many of the same
criticisms here as were raised
against the Dean at U Mass.

They say that he is “unrespon-
sive,” "repressive," “uncompro-
mising,” and "unfair."

campus, much like the student-
faculty committee formed at U
Mass aimed at attaining the same
goal.

—And there are the poor rela-
tions with many departments in
the Arts and Sciences College.
At U Mass, Hunsbcrger encoun—
tered problems mainly with the
art and history departments. The
professor there claimed that as
many as one third of the depart—
ment heads had resigned an ac-
count of Hunsbcrgcr.

Here at SUNY Albany, the

problems seem to be centered
around the art, geology, and
biology departments, although
antagonisms are found elsewhere
as well.

In recent weeks, considerable
information has been unearthed
concerning the Dean‘s activites
while at U Mass — information
which has considerable bearing
on how he operates the Arts and
Sciences College here. There was
news concerning how the Dean
closed an art exhibit because it
was "obscene," a move which
caused considerable furor on

campus, with charges of censur-
ship being leveled at the U Mass
administration. There was the
firing of popular professors at U
Mass, most notably Richard Del-
la Grotte, who complained that
“good teaching not only does
not count, but may actually
work against you." Hunsberger
had called him "irresponsible."
Most important, however, were
Hunsbcrger’s problems with the
history department at Amherst
— problems which led to his
resignation, and problems which
many faculty members say are
