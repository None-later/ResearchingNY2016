Recently the budget Committee at SUNYA recommended that AMIA's submitted
budget be cut by more than $8,000. With this in mind, last Friday'l talked with AMIA
advisor Denny Elkin and AMIA president Lloyd Fishman to get an overview of AMIA
and find out why they felt that the budget cuts were drastic.

ASP: What is the basic appeal of AMIA?

Fishman: We try to appeal to the average student to come out and recreate.

ASP: How many people participate in AMIA?

Elkin: Last year 4,120 athletes took part in AMIA activities. We have no way of
knowing how many individual students take part in AMIA. This year we estimate that
approximately 6,000 athletes will participate in AMIA sports. This does not include
spectators and officials involved in each activity.

ASP: How many sports does AMIA have?

Elkin: There are 19 sports that a student at Albany can take part in including Flag
football, Soccer, Cross-Country, Bowling, Golf, Wrestling, Basketball, Handball, Squash,
Swimming, Volleyball and Softball.

ASP: What sport is most popular?

Elkin: Team-wise basketball with 110. Softball has the most students involved with
1,306 taking part last year.

ASP: Can anyone participate in AMIA?

Elkin: Anyone who pays student tax can compete. We don't requirc anyone to take a
physical. According to AMIA's consitution, which was printed in 1947, this organiza-
tion is for men only. Last year, the AMIA council recommended that it might be a good
idea to allow girls to compete. Right now girls are participating in Volleyball, bowling,
swimming, and softball. They are not permitted to compete in contact sports. In the
case of the Jockettes (women's AMIA softball team) we were not trying to discourage
them from competing in AMIA. We only felt that the Jockettes Would rather compete
in League ill but just missed the meeting. Right now they are competing in League 1.

ASP: Who really runs AMIA?

Elkin: This is sort of a tricky question. it's really a combination of the AMIA Council
and myself. l don't make any of the decisions. I just advise the council. l am the
University's representative. The AMIA Council is composed of M members with one of
these spots left open for incoming freshmen. 'l‘hey determine all policies. The three
most important members on the council are the chairman of the officials committee,
treasurer and Lloyd, the president.

ASP: Why did the budget for AMIA get cut?

Fishman: The big reason is the people on the budget committee and Central Council
on the whole are not AMIA participants and do not know how we operatc.

Elkin: It's all part of the idea of mass programming.

ASP: Where were the cuts‘.’

Elkin: The toughest cut came in the area of our Student Assistants. Next year the
budget committee recommended that the total salaries of our four '. stunts should he
cut from $4,000 to $1,600 or 80 cents an hour. 'l‘liese four student assistants must
cover a vast area because there are so many games going on at the same time on many
different fields. All of these students must be mature, responsible and people you can
trust. To pay them 80 cents an hour Would be ridiculous.

Fishman: The budget committee and Central Council are jealous of the salaries that
the student assistants make. They complain that the ~ .stants make more money
($800) than SA president Mike Lampcrt ($700). They don't say anything about the
power and prestige that they have,

The other big cut in the budget is that of the referees. The budget committee feels
that we are paying our officials too much. ltiglit now we iire paying our referees in
basketball and softball $2.50 and $12.0tla game and in football $2.75 and $2.25 a game.
i don't feel that we are really ovcrpaying our officials. Over the summer l umpire games
in the Stan Musiiil baseball Leagur- and i get llilli a game. The budget commith feels
that our refs should want to do it for the enjoyment but who wants to rcf a game on a
Saturday morning in the rain.

Elkin: 1 think We pay our refs a fair dollar and cvvn then they don‘t always show up.
We can't function without refs. We have to make the salary appealing enough so people
will want to show up.

The salaries for the student assistants and for referees comprise $0,500 of our budget
of $1 t),rl00, The money We pay goes right back into the hands of students.

ASP: What is the future of AMIA’.’

Elkin: If we llilll the money we can expand. ()nc spurt which would definitely be
implemented In lli. eon-three baskclball. Other sports that I like ll):~'t'1'i|rt’t|ll('~(ill onc
basketball. indoor floor hockey, water polo, luluI rallies, and mm a boxnig tournament.
But the big key is money.

Elkin 8. Fishmon Discuss AMIA's Situation

The money and the facilities we have no way compares to many other schools. I went
to an intramural convention and it's depressing when you compare budgets and facilities.
We couldn’t even publish our freshmen handbook and a school like Buffalo University is
able to publish four separate books. To give an example of how far intramurals have
progressed at some schools: Nassau County Community College even has intramural sky
diving.

ASP: What about the facilities here?

Elkin: During the winter, we are working with 110 basketball teams and only two
courts. The only free time in the gym in the winter is before 3 o'clock and Gym C.
Between P.E. classes, the varsity teams and the intramural basketball teams, the gym is
used all of the time.

Compared to other schools we are behind again in facilities. Smaller schools like
Potsdam, Cortland and I’latlsburgh have their own ﬁeld house. Many school intramural
associations have been able to build their own facilities.

ASP: What about the student who just wants to shoot baskets on a Friday night?

Elkin: There is no place for people like that. At the beginning of the year they
couldn't even get equipment. What this school needs is a person to coordinate a
recreation program.

ASP: How did AMIA do in the student association poll‘.’

Fishman: We fared pretty poorly. Basically the people who voted are student
association oriented.

ASP: Any final comments?

Elkin: There is a demand on campus for an organized athletic program for the average
student. AMIA is that program.

We submitted a budget that is not padded, We need every cent listed for equipment,
student assistants and referees.

Analysis of the AMlA situation: The purpose of the new budget submitted is mass
programming (cuts in smaller clubs). This in itself can be questioned but if AMIA is not
a mass activity of this university, 1 don't know what is. One can just look at the athletic
fields each day to realiZe the great extent of this program. The budget cut is uncalled for
and completely ridiculous. 'l‘lic budgctcommittce is completely insensitive to the needs
of many Albany students. If anything, more money should be appropriated to make tlic
program on par with most universities.

It might not be too late to stop this slash in the budget, Central Council still llih to
apprch the budget. if AMIA can go into Central Council with the names of as many
students as possible requesting that the budget cuts be restored, maybe our
representatives will sec that AMIA is a vital part of this university. But you as a student
must become involved. The best way is to send your letters to me or the AMIA office. if
you don’t haVe time to write a letter, i am enclosing a form at the bottom of this article
Just fill in your name and your ll) number and check that you want the budget cuts
restored. Please bring all your forms or letter to the ASP offiCc or the AMlA ol'ficc.

if you just sit back and let the other guy fill out the form and you do nothing, then
maybe next year there won't be any intramurals to play.

Special to the ASP

l. Moyer Hunsberger, Dean of
SUNYA’s College of Arts and
Sciences, seems to be a man
unable to escape his problems.

Formerly Dean of the Arts and
Sciences College at the Universi-
ty of Massachusetts at Amherst,
lluiisberger is encountering
many of the same kinds of an-
tagonisms, misunderstandings,
and poor departmental relations
that plagued him while at the
Massachusetts college:

i-Thcrc are the numerous resig-

nations among faculty who find
it difﬁcult to work with him.
During the past two years three
department chairmen have
stepped dOWn, an associate dean
has left, and several other profes-
sors have been forced out.

—There are the critics, both
vocal and publicly silent, who
are raising many of the same
criticisms here as were raised
against the Dean at U Mass.
They say that he is “unrespon-
sive," "repressive," “uncompro-
mising," and “unfair.”

i-Tlicre is an “Oust Hunsbcrg-

er" movement forming on this
campus, much like the student-
faculty committee formed at U
Mass aimed at attaining the same
goal.

—And there are the poor rela-
tions with many departments in
the Arts and Sciences College.
At U Mass, Hiinsberger encoun-
tered problems mainly with the
art and history departments. The
professor there claimed that as
many as one third of the depart-
ment heads had resigned on ac-
count of Hunsbcrger.

Here at SUNY Albany, the

 
 

ALBAN

 

problems seem to be centered
around the art, geology, and
biology departments, although
antagonisms are found elsewhere
as well.

In recent weeks, considerable
information has been unearthed
concerning the Dean’s activiies
while at U Mass * information
which has considerable bearing
on how he operates the Arts and
Sciences College here. There was
news concerning how the Dean
closed an art exhibit because it
was "obscene," a move which
caused considerable furor on

campus, with charges of censor-
ship being leveled at the U Mass
administration. There was the
ﬁring of popular professors at U
Mass, most notably Ricliard Del-
la Grotte. who complained that
“good teaching not only does
not count, but may actually
work against you.“ Hunsberger
had called him “irresponsible.”
Most important, however. were
Hunsberger's problems with the
history department at Amherst
s problems which led to his
resignation, and problems which
many faculty members say are
