continued lrom 039: one
paralleled here at SUNYA.

The history department story
goes as follows:

In 1968 Hunsberger appointed
Robert Potash to be head of the
U Mass History Department in
spite of the fact that most of the
faculty there — especially the
junior members — opposed him.
and in spite of Potash‘s opposi-
tion to a new constitution which
had just been passed by the
department 26-11. However, the
department faculty acquiesced
in the Potash appointment be-
cause it was ostensibly for only
one year and they had been
carefully assured that the com
nuttee searching for a surtable
candidate from outside the uni-
versity would continue to oper-
ate.

However. tn the words of one
disgruntled faculty member.
Hunsbergei "arbitrarily" dis-
solved the search committee in
the fall of Whit and then. 3w
cording to this same protessor.
“miraculously resurrected it" on
February 11. 1069 in order to
endorse his recommendation oi
the reappointment or the un-

popular Potash. This same pro—
fessor went on to say that, “It
was not surprising" that the
“committee members reluctant-
ly concurred" since they were all
Hunsberger appointees in the
ﬁrst place."

On February 13 Hunsberger
announced that he would meet
with the full history department
faculty on Febntary 20 to dis-
cuss his proposed recommenda-
tion of Potash‘s appointment.

However. on February 18, sev-
eral faculty members “accident-
ally" received in the mail a copy
of a personnel action form show-
ing that Potash had already been
recommended by Hunsberger on
February ft. approved by the
Provost on February II. and by
the President on February 13.
the day on which Hunsberger
announced that he would meet
With the history department to
discuss his recommendation.

At the February 30 meeting.
Hunsberger was directly asked if
he had already recommended
the reappointment o1 Potash
and. acctildlllg to another prr»
lessor. llunsberger “indignantly
denied that he had." Before the

 

ogmzed overseas medical schools.

Student Financial Aid Approved:

 

Congress gnores Nixon’s Budget Priorities '

Washington D.C. (CPS)—
Acting with unusual speed, the
House and Senate have approved
funds for several student ﬁnun-
cizil aid programs for academic
1073-1974, including a small
amount to initiate the Basic Op-
portunity Grant (BOG) program.

Congressvirtually ignored Pres-
ident Nixon’s spending priorities
in funding NDSL loans and sup-
plemental grants. The President‘s
budget had deleted these twu
programs and requested $622
million for the ROG program
instead. But (‘ongrcss has
thatched to the penny the totril
funding level for student assist-
ance sought by the President.

$872 million with the lion‘s
share being given to 8005. (‘on-

The $33 million difference is

by Congress for NDSL loans btit
impounded by the President.
('ongtcss took this money and
added it to NDSL loans for
zrcrrdctnic 1973-1974, bringing
the new appropriations for stu-

dent ﬁnancial aid for next year
to $895 million. Another stu-
dent aid program for next fall,
Federally Insured Student Loans
(FISL), received funds lust 0c-
tober.

Showdown

The reshuffling of funds could
provoke a sliowdDWn between
Congress and the White House
over spending priorities.

day.

There was some resentment in
the House at the manner in
which the Flood Amendment
appeared overnight. But Con-
gress is aware that the programs
had to be funded soon to beneﬁt

feel the state of chaos in ﬁnan-

Student Lobby (NSL). one of
the many groups trying to force
action on the appropriations be-
fore tlic end of this session of
Congress.

to pass the measure.

if ﬁnancial aid appropriations
were not voted on this session of
Congress, then thousands of stu-
dents would not know if funds
would be available for next fall
and they would perhaps post-
pone entering college for a year.
This would have had a disastrous
effect oti higher education which
already has had millions of dol-
lars in federal aid axed by the
Nixon budget.

The big question is whether or
not Nixon will accept the insult
of having his budget priorities
completely disregarded by Con-
gress. Student financial aid could
easily become another victitti of
the battle between the legislative
and executive branches for con-
trol of the federal pursestrings.

Nixon could simply veto the
bill. let it die unsigned or sign it
into law and their refuse to
spend the money allocated for
the programs he wishes to cart-

cel. A. veto could tie up student
ﬁnancial aid for months. If the
President decides to impound
funds for $5005 and NDSL
loans, students will be left with a
fraction of the money available
last year being administered, for
the most part, by two untried
and untested programs — B005
and FISL loans.

Olson is pleased that ﬁnancial
aid ﬁnally cleared Cotigress and
is on its way to becoming law.
NSL supported the funding of
the existing programs before the
new ones, as required by law. It
had listed as its ﬁrst priority
rapid action on the part of Con-
grcss to allow students to plan
for the next academic year with
sortie idea of what funds would
be available.

At least the first step in this
process has been made. It is now
up to the White House to deter-
mine the fate of student finan-
ciul aid for acaderiiic 19734974.
