Animals Seek Executives

Eleanor Seiling, President of
United Action for Animals, Inc.,
announced today that UAA is
turning to the universities in an
intensive search for young exec-

utive talent.
“A new breed ofhumane lead-

ers is needed," she said, “and
they should come from the res-
ervoir of well—educated young
people now In our universities
and abour to embark upon their
careers." She noted that his-
torically almost all of the people
in animal welfare work in gen-
eral and laboratory animal work
in particular are there because of
a keen sense of injustice to
animals and a high degree of
motivation.

But. she observed. "they lack
birth the ability to inform them-
st.‘l\t.'\ adequately and the profes-
\lllltdlhlll needed to solve corri-
pit-x problems,”

Mm Seiling is del'riritc about
the qualifications needed by can
dldritcs. "A liiuadIy-liasr‘il t‘tllM tr-
tiori is essential." slrc slatc. “be-

cause anyone who is going to be
effective in helping animals must
develop a composite of many
skills. including biology, law, ad-
vertising, public relations, and
corporate administration. They
must be diligent readers and able
to write well. They must be
adept at library research, compe-
tent analysts of what they read,
and possess the ability to com-
municate articulater without
being abrasively vocal." She said
that a highly motivated person
with a broad basic education can
develop these skills, but that it
would take time.

Miss Seilirig estimates that it
Would require four years of in-
tensive orr~lhc-ioh training with
UAA to prepare a candidate for
the “kind of executive leader-
ship we envisage.“

The President of UAA poiirted
out that there exists a Vital need
for leaders of executive calibre
Ill the licld of animal welfare in
general and laboratory animals
rtt particular and that the re-

wards are great, personally and
professionally. “But,” she add-
ed, “candidates t'or this work
must show a very high degree of
motivation.“

Interested persons should write

Inc., 509 Fifth Avenue, New

details, keeping in mind the
qualiﬁcations outlined.
