scandal is grabbing headlines,
the Wall Street Journal reports
that another potentially
damaging scandal — involving
John Mitchell and other high-
ranking republicans — is brewing
in New York City.

The Journal states that a
federal Grand Jury is
questioning witnesses involved
in the Robert L. Vesco case.
Vesco is an international finan-
cier, who, until last year, headed
up the inbestors overseas services
conpany. The US. Securities
and Exchange Commission is
charging, however, that Vesco.
Illegally used his position with
the company to loot it of $224
million in mutual finds.

According to the Journal

sources close to the New York
Grand Jury are reporting that
Vesco's associates are testifying
that he gave a quarter of a
million dollars to the Nixon re-
election committee last year in
an unsuccessful effort to have
the investigation against him
halted. The Journal states it has
learned the following details in
what it terms “another murky
affair."

Vesco met in March of 1972
with former Nixon cabinet
member and campaign finance
chairman Maurice Starts to
arrange for a “cash donation" to
the reelection committee. Stans
suggested tiia Vesco contribute
$250,000, with most of it in
cash. Stans then set up meetings
between Vesco's associates and

former Attorney General John
Mitchell.

The President's brother,
Edward Nixon, was later
contacted at LaGuardia Airport
ab0ut how Vesco’s contribution
should be sent to the Nixon
committee. Ed Nixon was
reportedly then flown by heli-
copter form the airport to a
Vesco corporation headquarters
in New Jersey where he per-
sonally arranged for $200,000 in
lOO-dollar bills to be brought to
Washington. Several days later,
the money was carried to the
Nixon committee offices in “a
worn brown briefcase."

According to one of Vesco's
attorneys who was present
when the $300.00 was turned
over to Stairs the Vesco repre»

sentative carrying the nomey re-
layed a personal messagecfrom
Vesco. The message was: “sure
hope we get some proper help
somewhere along the line."

After the $200,000 was
received, Mitchell contacted the
chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and other
S.E.C. ofﬁcials and arranged for
meetings between S.E.C. investi-
gators and Vesco‘s representa-
tives.

The Nixon committee
eventually returned all the
money to Vesco 7 but not until
this year, nine months after it
had been given. The money was
returned only after word of the
large icontribution reached
Washington newspapers.

Vesco, in the meantime. has

Independence "for v C

by Melvin Mencher

An old idea in a new garb is
moving through the halls of aca-
deme. It is "independence," in-
dependence for the campus
newspaper.

But there's more than meets
the eye to this new-found free-
dom, Some student newspaper
staff members who have had a
chance to experience indepen-
dence are now having second
thoughts. That feeling of
independence which in the
process of transformation
appeared to be a good and
healthy occurence has taken on
an altogether different connota-
tion -- independence-by-pressure.
Going off campus to attain a
free and unfettered press in rear
lily has become a restriction of
the press' ability to serve its
readers, and the actual benificia-
rivs are those college administra-
tors who had always wirslietl that
initiative student journalists
would go away.

Independence comes at a time
when the restraints on the Col-
lege press hriVe all but vanished
because of a series of federal
court rulings. Sturient news-
papers liave the same freedoms
as the commercial press, the
courts have said. Significantly,
the increased intereiit in the
independent newspaper occurs
just as students are flexing their
political muscle, College admini-
strators can l'orsee intent-ii: acti»
vism by the college press in local
matters, in legislative elections,
and in state politics. At a time
colleges ilrt’ worried about their
financing, an aggressive college
newspaper is hardly their idea of
an asset.

The college press has been
widening its interests ovor the
years as it examiners social rririli-
tics in a society supposedly com-
mitted to equality. The college
press has moVed from concern
over equality for the races to
equality for the sexes. Its next
stop could well be an examina-
tion of the inequalities that
wealth, or" its lack,

Independent college news~
papers liavr- iii-cit around a long

time, particularly in the Ivy
League. But the idea had never
caught on.

The ﬁnancially independent
newspaper relies almost com-
pletely on advertising and most
college town could not support a
daily or weekly newspaper.

Editor Mike Wines of the Uni-
versity of Kentucky Kernel --
which has been financially in-
dependent since January 1972 --
advises college newspapers think-
ing of going it alone to hire a
full-time advertising manager, a
professional adviser and a book-
keeper And to make sure the
advertising base is solid.

"The economics of campus
newspapers makes independency
a chancy proposition for
anyone,“ he says

Tire Kerrie! which Wines de-
scribes as the "nation’s only
completely independent paper it
it state university, excluding off
campus newspapers," has an ad-
viaer who serves as general manor
ger and handles budgetary mat
tors. The adviser is also available
for consultation on editorial
matters, but only at the request
of the staff.

Since losing the university's
$40,000 a year subsidy, the
Kernel has been doing well on
advertising income. A factor,
according to Kernel staffers, is
the ineptitude of the local news-
papers which are owned by a
trust and administered by a
bank. The local newspapers havr‘
a ill percent campus readership.
'I‘lir- Louisville (,‘ourrier-Joui'iiul
reaches iii) percent of the stu-
dents. The Kernel claims to have
a 04.5 percent campus reader-
ship.

The college newspaper that
publishers off campus, is distri-
buted only to priid subscribers,
and receives no direct or indirect
financial assistance from the univ
verriity is it rarity. Most news-
pupch tlirit assert they are in-
dependent usurilly refer to crliv
toriril freedom rather than their
financial status

Most so-calied independent
newspapers remain on the cam-
pus. At the University of Colo-
redo, the Colorado Daily’s letter-
head describes the newspaper as
“an independent student news-
paper," referring to the fact that
in 1968 it surrendered the com-
pulsory student activity fee,
which supports most student
newspapers. The Daily is now
completely supported by adver~
tising. But it is given space on
the campus rent-free because it
is a student organization.

Drawbacks of independence

Most college newspapers that
have become ﬁnancially inde-
pendent plan to continue to
distribute their newspapers to all
students, even though students
will no longer be paying for
them through the student acti-
vitv fee.

At Colorado and Kentucky the
editors say that full distribution
makes their newspapers truly
campus newspapers, whereas
newspapers like the Cornell
Daily Sun and the Michigan
Daily -- which charge $10 a year
for subscriptions -- reach a third
to half of the students. Free
distribution is also easier to
maintain; paid subscribers re-
quire service. The Michigan
Daily says its circulation had
been galling off because of fai-
lures in its delivery sustem. And
at Harvard, where the Crimson is
delivered to paid subscribers, the
problem of deliVery has been
persistent.

College administrators anxious
to make their campus news-
papers independent may find
trouble from an unexpected
quarter -- local commercial news-
papers.

Coilege newspapers before in-
dependence received a third to
half of their income from the
student activity fee. Now 95
percent of their income will have
to come from advertising. The
Stanford Daily for example, now
sells about $100,000 in adverti—
sing. Under iis projections, it
will have to sell about $180,000
in advertising in 1978.

The effect on the news staff is
more subtle, At the Colorado
Dally, when the newspaper be-
came independent and had to go
into the marketplace to sell
advertising, it found resistance
among merchants who were up—
set by the Daily '5 radical politics
and its use of so-called obsceni-
tiesr

Kirk Ladendorf, a former edi-
tor. said the staff was aware it
was endangering its hope for
survival.

"We tended to be more care-
ful," he said.

Adminstrators describe this as
responsibility. Those in aca-
demic ivy‘clad towers would say
that this lessens the students'
ability to experiment.

The idea of independence
