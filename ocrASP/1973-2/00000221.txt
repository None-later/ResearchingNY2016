Why is therea lettuce boycott7
Migrant farmworkers are
struggling for a decent life for
themselves and their children.
Their employers-corporate
growersehave refused to nego-
tiate or conduct union elections
with the United Farmworkcrs
even after 7.000 lettuce workers
in the Salinas Valley went on
strike in August of 1970. Unlike
industrial workers. agricultural
workers are not protected by
labor legislation guarantecing
their right to collective hare
gaining A national boycott is
the only way the farmuorkera
have of forcing the growers to

growers will have to sign con-

Why is there a boycott of all
.40 stores? Mr? is the largest
seller of scab lettuce in the
country. A&P is selling lettuce
from growers who are denying
farm workers basic rights. A&P
has consiStenly refused to we
operate in any manner with the
national lettuce boycott. ln
Albany. the regional Fuller Road
management has refused to dis-
cuss the lettuce boycott.

Why do farmworkers need a
union7 Farmworkers need a
umon for the same reasons all
other industrial workers need a
union. Farmworkers need a
union to guarantee their rights
to organize and sign contracts
and to bargain for fair wages and
important beneﬁts such as un-
employment compensation and
limited use of pesitiCidcs. A
union would protect farm-
workers from these miserable
living and working conditions:

—Over 90% of farmworkers‘

—In 1971, at least 12% of

Is it all lettuce or just iceberg?
Only non-UFW iceberg head let-
tuce is being boycotted. Why
not try romaine, leaf lettuce,
escarole. chicory or spinach in-
stead?

ls UFW lettuce available?
There is a small amount (about
15%) of lettuce harvested under
contract with the United Farm-
workers Union. The only way to
be 100% sure it is union lettuce

union label right on the lettuce

Independence for Campus PreSs f

continued from page nine

at. the University of California.
The student press on the cam-
puses of the Univerity of Califor-
nia system had long bemlibeml
in its polities, frank in its useﬂof
language, and unstinting in its
criticism of Governor Ronald
Reagan and his University Board
of Regents. One regent, John
Canridy, was particularly vehe-
ment. about those newspapers.
He insisted that President
Charles J. Hitch do something
about. them. In 1969 Mitch rc-
sponded by appointing a Special
Commission on the Campus
Press, asking it to explore “the
possibility of need for n written
code of performance."

In its findings the Commission
suggested that as many news-
papers tis possible sock ﬁnancial
independence from the univer-
sity so that press conflicls with
school administration could be
kept. at a minimum. lL recog-
nized this was not. feasible for all
the newspapers in the Californian
system. The mild tone of the
report, indeed its. strong defense
of the students‘ rigth to publish
without interference, angered
some of the regents. One tried to
censor the report itself. Caniiday
simply put it aside.

Criiiaday had assembled exam-
ples of what he described as
proof that the newspapers were
“instruments of satin-political
advocacy and (were used) for
the dissemination of lewd and
til)st‘ent’ articles and [)h()l.l)‘
graphs." (The Commission had
found that “the occasional Use

Californian on the Berkeley cam-
pus refused to go along. After 99
years of publication on campus,
the Daily Californian found it.
could not. cover the campus
freely under the guidelines of
the regents and moved out.

To keep the newspaper sol-
vent, Wuicher said, the paper has
become “nothing more than a
shopper two of the ﬁve days of
the week."

Independence was suggested to
the staff of the Daily Nexus on
the Santa Barbara campus of the
University of California last sum»
mer after it conflict. with the
president, who had comman-
deered the newspaper to publish
a retraction that the staff felt.
was unnecessary.

“aning watched the sad do
cline of the Daily Californian at
Berkeley after it. was shoved off
the campus by the University we
decided to remain very way of
university motivations," editor
Mike Gordon said.

Repression in South

In the South, massch social
and political changes were set. in
motion by the decision 0'. the
United States Supreme Court.
that. ordered the desegregation
of public schools. The Campus
press not only reported these
changes, if. urged them on recal-
citrant. communities and states.
At the University of Florida, the
Alligator looked into politics
and condemned the activities of
the pork~choppcr, the politician
from northern Florida who
bowed to the old ways. In the
mid-l9f305, the Alligalor's zeal
caused the president of the uni-
versity to ﬁrt' the editor.

When 1 invcsLiguletl the Sllull'

Newspaper Editors. The Daily

If any newspaper in the l' niver-
sity system could make a go of it.
without university auppoort,
Californian editors fall; they had
the best. chance. Now, more than
a year after independence, the
editor of the Daily Californian,
Christine E. Weicher, sums up
her sentiments about what. in-
dependence has meant to her
newspaper: “The only merit 1
see is the freedom we have over
our editorial page. Those who

have actually beneﬁted from our
move off campus are the regents
of the University of California.
Independence was never de-
signed l.o help the newspaper or
aid in training the staff involved,
but. rather the Berkeley admini-
stration and the regents are. now
safe from pomible libel suits and
embarrmmenl."

“The image of the institution
retained by the traditionalists in
that of a pleasant, moral
Christian community, designed
to incubate businessmen and to
recruit, rig has been traditional
within this institution, cadres for
the state's political system.

“A new aggressive group repre-
senting urban Florida and
national urban values no longer
accepts sacred cows nor ﬁnds
the pleasant, provincial fraterr
nity and sorority life anything
but funny.”

The editor of the Alligalor in
1965-66, Benny Cason, took
little interest in the social activi-
ties on campus. He paid more
attention to faculty and admini-
strative decisions and to the
quality of scholarship and in-
struction than he. did to the
results of football games. He also
looked ill. Florida politics. As a
result, the president fired him.

This rule of the uniVersily its

ment class or physics laboratory.

infused by young men and
women whose talents extend
beyond headline writing and
event-oriented reporting, then it
is the university that must pro-
vidc the classroom and the prac-
tical experience for these stu~
dean. it is thr- univcrsily that
must provide the idea of whﬂl.
journalism is all about, its values,
its relation to society.

The university is precisely the
placo for journalistic experi-
ment, for in the commercial
world new concepts are
approached limidly.

Those administrators who are
inclined to follow the California
and Florida examples would do
so against their self-interest.
They might reﬂect on the role of
the free press. One of its tasks is
to defuse potential ideas that if
suppressed might shatter the
community. A campus news-
paper that is ﬁnancially healthy
so that it can reach everyone on
l.ll(' campus (most. independent
papers sell to only a third of the
sludcnls) and has plenty of
space for news and opinion
ultimately works to the butter-
menl of the university.

Don’t change
your summer
plans

If you’re going to spend a
lot of this coming summer
around the wafer—sailing
and swimming—you‘ll want
the protection of Tampax
tampons.

Girls have frequently
wondered about swimming
during those difficult days.
Old—fashioned napkins
make swimming
impossible, but with
Tampax tampons the
message has always been:
"Go ahead and swim."
You’re dependably
protected internally. And
you never have to «our
worry about anything Wm
showing under aunnnt
swimsuits because internal
protection is invisible
protection.

80 don't change your
summer plans just
because your period might
interfere. Tampax tampons
let you sail, swim, water-
ski, sunbathe—just like
any other day of the month.
