egyi

by Andy Palley

Julius Hegyi and Richard
Nixon have one trait in com-
mon. Both can and do commit
the most incredible blunders in
personal relations, and both
come out smelling like roses.I'm
not sure whether Hegyi can live
down the mistakes he made
during the last Albany Sym-
phony concerts, though. In fact,
the ripples are reaching into the
musical world like a mini-
Watergate.

The problem is a persistent
the Albany Symphony has hired
three of the greatest pianists
alive to play three large con-
certos. Philippe Entremont left
the concert two years ago in ii
huff. Eugene leomiii was

furious with Maestro Hegyi's
handling of Beethoven's Fourth

Piano Concerto last year, but
tried not to let it bother him (he

turned to the orchestra after-

ward and chuckled, “Well, I'll
see you on the battleground

tomorrow").

What Hegyi did to Misha
Dichter, this year's soloist, was a
two-fold insult. He insisted all
during the rehearsals of the
Brahms First Piano Concerto
upon a mediorcrity unsurpassed
in the annals of classical perfor-

mance. In addition, his know-
ledge of the work was question'
able. This was evident in con-
cert when he conducted with his
eyes glued to the score, giving
half-hearted cues and ﬂimsy
grate"- .Praagil‘vm. it.” til:
remarks made by Dichter about
the music. Dichter is only one of
the top musicians of our day and
a prodigy of immense propor-
tion.

What it seems to boil down to
is that Julius Hegyi will not
share a spotlight with anyone.
This was proven in a dramatic
way at the premier concert in
Troy Music Hall on Friday, April
13th. After the entire concert
was ovor, and the conductor and
soloist had taken their first
hows, the applause was tremen-
dous. Everyone was; calling for
Dichter. Well, Dichter came out,
followed by Hegyi. This
happened twice more, wiili
I-Iegyi hogging the limelight all
four times. Dichter was furlUUs.
He had played under Bernstein,
Szcll, Leinsdorf, and most
recently with the London
Symphony under Ceccato, and
was never so rudely treated,
both in rehearsal and in concert.
Conductors are supposed to help
bring out the music, not bring
out themselves.

Scondcrlizes

'Julius Hegyi thinks that he is
capitalizing on the popular
notion of the “Conductor as
Superstar,” as Leonard Bern-
stein, Michael Tilson-Thomas,
Zubin Mehta and Sir George
Solti have done. Unfortunately,
none of these conductors have
ever lost their dedication to the
music as Hegyi has done. They
are helpful leaders, who acknow.
ledge greatness when they see it.
They know what making music
is all about. That‘s why they are

Con Ric

by Mitchell Zoler

With the release of this album,
a forseeable and, to most
extents, superfluous debate has
begun among “experts” as to
who is the better keyboard
artist, [tick Wakcman or Keith
Emerson. I call the arguments
superfluous since it iscomparablc
to a discussion of who is
superior, Mozart or Brahms.
While each has his points. each is
also, unquestionably, a genius
and ergo any decision boils
down to a question of taste.

The analogy of classical
masters also fits well, since in
Wakcmaii's album we reach one
of the best extensions of the
well developing medium of
"(‘lassical ltock." The way this
can be defined, in terms of
Wakcmaii‘s album, is that
Wakcnian will take a theme and,
although he might repeat it, be
will render it virually undetect-
able to the original through Vari-
ations ii context and orchestra
tion. This is in opposition to the
way I would deﬁne a traditional
pop-rock piece, which can be
identified by the virtually
unmodified repetition of the

Guest '

at the top of their ﬁeld.

Julius Hegyi is a showman. He
has done wonders for the pres-
tige of a second rate orchestra.
He is also a good-enough
musician to handle such an
orchestra. If one were to throw
him in front of the Philadelphia
Orchestra, where every player is
a virtuoso, he would collapse in
a fit of insecurity. Either that or
the players would refuse to pick
up their instruments. Which the
Albany Symphony would have

I . t

done, had Misha Dichter been
self-centered enough to tell them
so. Instead, Dichter played
Saturday night. He played so
incredibly that the audience was
outraged when he didn't mimi-
out for his bows. Misha Dichter
had raced out the side door loi-
the more civilized world of \‘.-,t
York City, with a pl‘nmisc lrom
promoter Sol “Until that llli lllll'

akemon Excel?

Orchestration plays a large part
in this album,usually reaching the
heights of an unbelievable tour
(le force, although at times the
diversity dcgcncratcs into a
needless ego trip. What occurs is
that the music cons ts virtually
of Wakcnian on piano, electric
piano, harpsichord, mellotron,
electric organ, electric harpsi-
chord, organ (from St. iilcs,
(lripplegate, England) and
various kinds of mougs. This
point is underscored by an
accompanying photo showing
him surrounded by this mess.
Somehow, Wiikcmaii can coor-
dinate them into unified,
sensible, polishcd picccs of
music.

  

 

The works are much too
abstract and complex to in-
dis: wind and tliscilsscd in
plcccs. 'l‘hc best l can (hi is to
say I think they are all excellent.
'l'licir relation to any of lleiiry's
wivus is probably remote,
although Wakeiiian stutcs,“...it is
my personal conception of their
characters in relation to key-
board instruments." It really
makes very little difference

ECKANKAR: The Search for IT

Eckankar, the Ancient Science
of Soul Travel, will present a
film of the Living ECK Master
and an introductory talk and
discussion by Dr. Stephen
Brown on May 2 at 8:00 p.m. in
Lecture Center 25. The follow-
ing is an interview with Dr.
Brown.

What is Ec kankar'?

Eckankar, the Ancient Science
of Soul Travel, is a direct path to
total awareness, that Ultimate
Reality we call God. Through

that is theirs. The pursuit of
happiness, whether it be physical
pleasure, emotional involvement,
or mental knowledge is merely
the search for Truth distorted by
the individuals' lack of spiritual
unfoldment. Each individual is
free to choose exactly how he
will seek the Diety known as IT.
The essence of God is a spiritual
current, which when viewed
from the Soul‘s eye flows out of
the Ocean of Love and Mercy in
a wave which can be seen as
light, heard as sound and felt. as
an inner contentment. Eckankar

The Great Mail Robbery

After a year and a half of
operation, America’s latest gov-
ernmental Edsel, the Postal Ser-
vice Corporation, is grinding its
way toward crisis as mail deliv-
ery grinds to a halt. Same-day
miiil service, which at one time
was the pride of the nation, has
already become a thing of the
past in many parts of the coun-
try. The grand scheme of incor-
poriiting the postal system, oper
ating it as a business, cutting
costs and speeding delivery, has
simultaneously become the butt
of a new breed of cruelty jokes.

Former Postmaster General
Winton Blount, sitting in on one
of the early brainstorming ses-
sions on the problems of mail
delivery, is reported to hiiVe
said: “I‘ve been listening patient-
ly now for three hours, and all I
want is a simple answer to a
simple qucslion: [f it is neither
SnUW nor rill" IHH’ “(51”. [10"
gloom of night that is holding up
the mail, then just what the hell
is the trouble?"

The trouble is that the postal
corporation has moved too far
too fast in an effort to cut costs
at the i-xpciisc of scrvicc. While
the mail volume increased by 11.3
billion pieces over the last two
and a half years, the number of
postal employees tlccrcuscd by
more than (33,000. New
iiiachiiics designed to automati-
the mail syslvm were installed
without proper testing, and the
system has been designed around
other machines which are still on
llll' drawuig boards.

The haste has resulted in long
hours of mandatory chrliinc for
remaining postal cmployccs,
plummeting Worker moral to an
all time low.

(Jiily lop posliil administrators

bureaucratise which translates to
high salaries. Today 20 postal
officials are salaried at $42,000
per year or moreuas many high-
paid executives as are author-
ized for the entire federal execu-
tive branch minus cabinet mem-
bars.

The new approach calls for
centralized automated mailing
centers, and even before the first
of these new complexes was
finished and tested, the corpora-
tion committed itself to spend-
ing $5 billion for additional cen-
ters.

Meanwhile, neighborhood post
offices are being phased out and
local post-masters have not been
allowed to fill vacancies. 'I‘hat,
coupled with ever»increasing
growth in suburban population
centers, has pushed local offices
to the brink. One California resi-
dent rcported it took Ill days to
receive a letter mailed from ii
post office only 25 miles from
her home.

Members of Congress have
been flooded with similar com-
plaints. Senator Alan Cranstun
(l)-(7a|if.) told his colleagues that
constituent complaints about
mail service in the nation's lar-
gcsl stale siimclinics reach i()0
per day in his office. 'l‘hat level
of congressional mail flow spells
trouble for the fledgling postal
service corporation.

And ('Vi‘ll the corporation ad»
