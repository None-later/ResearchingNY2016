The DiVine Bette;

By Bill Yenne
My ﬁrst memory of Bette Mid-

and her New Yearfs Eve concert
at Philharmonic Hall, attended
by the cream of the rock/show
biz world, was met with glowing
reviews. And now a ﬁrst album.

“Do ya, do ya, do ya; do ya

wanna DANCE wi' me,
BABYl?"
The first side opens with

Bobby Freeman‘s Do You Want
To Dance? demonstrating her
interpretive potential, that bub-
bles under the surface of this
album like a volcano ready to
erupt. Her style is a synthesis of
all the guts and soul of Janis
Joplin and all the sauciness of
Mae West. it boggles the spleen
to conceive of such a synthesis.
Superstar, that Leon Russell
wrote with Bonnie Bramlett, is
another casein point.

“Baby, baby, baby, OH
BABY!! I love you.”

Conjuring up visions of Bessie
Smith makin' 'em cry in Carl

the song; and especially the title,
suits Bette Midler.

Leader of the Pack, on side
two, aside from being the best
version of this song ever record
ed, is a prime showcase of her
stage power. Building into a
racy, yet polished rocker, the
only thing it leaves to be desired
is to see it live.

Ranging from blues and rock
to gospel and whimsey (check
out Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy
and Kitty Wells’ Delta Dawn on
side two), this will be one of the
landmark albums of 1973. Bette
Midler’s rich style and total pres-
ence are going to make her to
the 70‘s what Presley was for the
50's and the Beatles were for the
60‘s. And Lord knows, after the
lethargy of the last few years, we
need it.

So check this one out folks.
It's a monumental album, and
just maybe, Bette Midler is the
light at the end of the tunnel. l

here lies john thomas
murdered from be
hind .1
by the greedy mechanism
of mechanized

madness

and a thousand electric
gods

roaring with

traffic.

come, let us toss machines,

our modern metal flowers

on his unburied body
sitting in this hollow wooden box. they say
it takes a day

or two
for sleepless slugs and manylegged worms to make their way

through the wooden package to the sleeping human prey.
on skin, lung, hair, brain, tongue and meat they feast,
on beggar's banquet of the blind.

ask not man nor nature
to complain of death—
each is busy feeding the other,
each toasts the others’ health,
and rising from their common table
they exchange their jokes about joiin tliomas
whom they murdered from be
hind, stabbed with lifts.

and someday while you’re walking lonely

far fromthere on some vague mountain
and you hear the distant murmur of some graveyard highway
or someday while you're locked away in

in your apartment city cell
and you hear the closeclose churning of the vehicles below
you may recall that its only

the sound of our electric gods

grinning laughing

holding their sides and roaring

with traffic.
