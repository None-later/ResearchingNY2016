A few years back Andy Warhol
informed us that “in the future,
everyone will be famous for 15
minutes." He forgot, however,
to tell anyone what to do after
they've Wd from brief fame to
years of displaced obsolescence.
Jefferson Airplane doesn’t: seem
to know, either, as evidenced by
the confusion that reigns
throughout their latest release,
'I'liirty Seconds ()uer Winterland
(Grunt BFL1-0147). Jack
Casady and Jorma Kaukonen
(with help from black fiddler
Papa John (Jreach) have found
an answer, and it's call Hot
Tuna, but that isn’t Jefferson
Airplane, although part of the
confusion is that almost half of
this album-the good half-is
really Hot Tuna: eleven minutes
of Jack, Jorma, and Papa John
churning through "Feel So
Good" and the dark, menacing
"l‘rral by Fire." 'I'una makes
sense » instrumentally, conceptu'
ally, and lately even vocally, In
fact, Jorma turns in the best
vocals on the album, which is
another way of saying that
(iraciv's lost her voice com
[Ilt‘fely (oh yeah, Paul Kantner
and ex Quicksilver David

the less said of their vocalizing
the better). lnstrumentally the
only difference between this live
recording and a ’l‘una LP is that
John Barhata's drumming is a bit
more civilized (and therefore less
fun without being much more
interesting) than Sammy “the
Basher" Piazza's.

Precisely those extraneous
elements are, of course, what
used to be a majestic phenome-
non the Jefferson Airplane; Paul
Kantner's acid/lucid/deranged
Visions propelled by those trade-
mark cluster harmonies and the
penetrating, sarcastic Gracie
Slick, All three elements have
fallen apart. Slick's voice is a
hurrit-out shell of Its former self
(testimony to the wondrous
pume of menthol Cigarettes
and cocaine), the harmonics ure
laughable since Marty Balin's
departure, and so, sad to say, is
Paul Kantner’s head. Paul's
visions are confused and dis-
jounted musically, lyrically, and
thematically. llalfway thru the
“Crown of Creation" (the theme
and lyrics of which were stolen
outright from a John Wyndham
science-ﬁction novel), while Paul
intones “In loyalty to their kind,
they cannot tolerate our minds".
Grace cracks “1 can’t, either."
Amen.
