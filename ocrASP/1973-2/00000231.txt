Tracksters Whip Sieno & Plottsburgh;

Reynolds Leads Albany to Ninth Win

by John Koch

The Albany State track team
extended its dual record to 9-0
in a 83-50-47 win over Siena and
Plattsburgh Wednesday.

The meet was the ﬁrst held at
Plattsburgh’s new outdoor faci-
lity. The Danes' performance
was a solid team effort but was
not as impressive as the victories
during the spring break. With an
important meet tomorrow
against Binghamton, Stony

Brook, and U. of Buffalo, Coach
Munsey gave two of his starters
the day off and switched other
men into different events to
conserve strength.

Dave Reynolds led team
scoring by finishing first in the
triple jump, second in the high
jump. and third in the long
jump. Other wins were recorded
by

by Bruce Maggin
“l don‘t want a losing season“
commented lacrosse Coach Bob
Ford after the team‘s fifth loss.
Winning has been somewhat of
a tradition by Albany State‘s
varsity teams. Since lacrosse was
introduced, the stickmen have
wheld this tradition. ’l‘hey h‘ld
lost only four games over the

past two seasons.

Danes Struggling
But this year things are dif-
ferent. Because of graduation.
this year's lacrosse team is young
and inexperienced. So far they
haw been struggling, posting a

Lee Kardas - high hurdles

Cliff McCarg - 100 dash

Tim Bilash - 440

John Streeter - 440 hurdles

Bilash, Tom Crowley, John Crea,

Sal Rodriguez - mile relay

Mike Okurily - long jump

Bob Malone - high jump

Rudy Vidol- Shot Put

Tom Moore - Javelin

One of the most interesting
events of the day was the return
trip which featured Coach
Munsey dacning in the aisle to
the music of James "Tiny"
Holloway.

The tracksters were impressive
in their four meets during the
spring break. R.P.I, was the first
victim, coming up on the short
end of a 79-66 score. The Danes
then broke Queens College's 213
meet win streak in a closi-
8593-78 win. Hurtwick finished a

distant third. Team depth was
the deciding factor as Queens
won over half of the events. In
winning both sprints, Cliff
McCarg tied the track record in
the 100 with a 9.7 clocking.

The team score remained close
throughout the contest with
Queens holding a slight edge
going into the final events. Jim
Shrader led the three mile
runners to a 1-2-3 finish with a
team and track record of
111: 14.8. This gave the Dimes a 6
point lead which was not relin-
quished.

The filial outcome was decided
in the jaVelin throw. In his final
attempt, 'l‘om Moore jumped
from fourth place to first with a
new team record of 190'5)”. Had
Moore remained in fourth, the
Albany cffort would have fallen
a half a point short of victory.

Face Losing Year
Middlebury 6-4

2-5 record. The stickmen will
have their work cut out for a
winning season because Albany
must win the next four out of
five games against some pretty
tough opposition.

Wednesday the team managed
its best game of the year but still
lost to Middlebury, (5-41. The
stickmen took a 4-3 lead into
the final period but lack of
depth plus inexperience hurt, as
Middlcbury scored three times
to gain the win

Hariwick's Five Run Ninth Clouis Albany 9-6

by Mark St. John

The Albany State baseball
team lost a horrible game on
Tuesday in the top of the ninth
When Hartwick exploded for five
runs including a three-run homer
over the 320 mark in left field,

Hartwiek got off to a quick
lead when they tagged starting
jPitcHer'Ken LaRoe for two
runs in the first. Then in the
fourth after walking in Hart»
wick's third run, LaRoe was
relieved by John Bertuzzi. With
bases loaded and no out, Ber»
tuzzi was able to get the first
hatter he faced to sacrifice to
center. Bases were then inten-
tionally loaded to set up the
force at any base, He proceeded
to pick-off the runner at third
and then struck out the last
batter to retire the side,

The most action for Albany,
who had been held to only two
hits for the first fiVe innings,

came in the bottom halfof the

was hit a pitched ball. Then Jack
Lcaliy, team captain, smashed a
hard hit single between sr-cond
and third and Hartwick's short-
stop could iioi handle. Bill
Lapp, Albany's third baseman,
followed with a hit through the
hole, knocking in Albany's first
run. First baseman Nick Ascien-
