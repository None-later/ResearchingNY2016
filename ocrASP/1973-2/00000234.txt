cotintry one grotesque lie after
another bathed in the rhetoric of
a dieing ideology.

He said that he was appalled at
this senseless. illegal. action, and
that he immediately ordered an
investigation by “appropriate
govciriiitcnt authorities." He did
not say that these appropriate
government authorities included
men like John Mitchell, John
Dean ill, and others who are
now candidates for prison seri-
tences. He went on to say, “1

the government or at the rev

that Patrick (iray resigned as
director of the FBI because he
birrucd "political dynaniitc"
that "could not see the light of

He \ptik’c about his desire to
leave "no implication whatever
ol personal wrongdoing on their

concern that tiic investigation
“guarded the integrity of otir

Today. Nixon does not appear
to be in any great trouble with
the voters of (‘cmralia. Btit there
is more questioning.

Ronald TOIarsky, a 28—year-
old dupiicating-riiachinc sales-
man discussed his feelings as he
and his young son fished m a
pond near their apartment.

“i think the whole tliitik
should have been opened tip and
exposed and forgotten," he said.
“The whole basis of the Republi-
can party is being undermined."

"i voted for Nixon riruseli'. i
personally feel that. since the
election and since Nixon was
voted in with such a landslide.
Nixon got the Idea that he could
do wliatcvcr lic dariiri well

"This is Middle

She said she wouldn‘t be sur-

Nixon was involved. But site

November and said she would
probably do it again.

“i don't think it has anything
to do with us." she said. “i‘m
just a small-town girl."

At the Pet Mart down the
street. Mrs. Vernon Ellerbush.
45, chatted about the case as .she
stocked shelves with chemical
solutions used in fish howls.

“As it goes the disclosures, l

tics as long as there has been
politics, The American people
lorch these kind of things." site
said.
