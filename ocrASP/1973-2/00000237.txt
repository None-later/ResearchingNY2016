Steve (:ierber,

 

Let's not asstrrrre that the Strident Association's
gloomy past prevents an aetive helping home. I
know that most ot‘ us look at Student Association as
a do-riothrng self-fulﬁlling bureaueraey. and certain-
ly tlie people who work in the Student (Eovernnient
are sometimes gtrilty ot' ego-tripping. In ten years.
this University has nearly dotibled iii si/.e btit tlie
problems of tire past have not been solved
the problems have grown rnueli worse. Anyone who
has stood In line for three hours at Ilie lltrrsrrr's
()t'tiee eari tell you that tlie bureatreraey I|iat is the
Adrrirrrrstratron of this seliool rs unable to deal Willi
even Ilie sriirillest hang -ups.

Let me outline sortie streerlie probleriis Whreh l

in tact.

hope we can solve rt'l arii eleeted:

 

 

‘. I". .2 Students are members ol the lloartl ol
Drreetors tltat rtiri FSA. tliotrgli our tL’plL‘MHlllllltIll
Is nowhere proportionate to tire Ineonre we generate
for the Lttlptiltllltllt. and we Will be able to etteet
some key ehariges.

Many leel that tlie niarrdatory drriner meal plan
