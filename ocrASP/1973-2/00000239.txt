"Walking Tall"

By Michael Lippman

I don’t think I'm capable of
summing up Walking Tall in a
way that would convince people
to see it. The great things about
this film defy verbal description,
but it is one of the most impor—
tant films to come along in quite
some time, and it should be seen
before it sneaks out. of its un-
noticed run at Cine 1234.

There have been previous
movies about tough cops who
believe in “Law and Order." The
creatures who populate the
Dirty Harry's and the French
Connections are machines, cold,
slick weapons of someone’s idea
of justice. And now, here is the
true story of Sheriff Buford Pus-
ser of McNairney County, Ten-
nessee, a man with a conscience.
(Amazing! A movie--in 1973,
alienated. anti-heroic America-
--about a man with a con-
science!) And a man faithful to
his wife, devoted to his children
and parents, ﬁercely dedicated
to protecting the weak and exA
ploited, a peaceful man, yet one
who will kill when necessary.

It all sounds like a Middle
American delight, and I hope
that upon hearing of the new
Law &Order film, Nixon will
place it as top priority for a
White House screening. It should
be enough to send him and his
crew running for their mediocre
former lives, safe from public
scrutiny. Because Walking Tall is

a film about a revolution, about
how the little people rise up
against the spoilers, those who
would corrupt and step on every
value ever known as decent, just
to cram a little more cash into
their already-bulging pockets.
Buford Passer is their Hero, all
Seven Samurai combined into
one avenger, out to destroy
those who, with their prosti-
tution, fixed gambling and poi-
soned moonshine have brought
the outside world into the para-
dise of his home.

It is something of an event to
see the portrayal of a man who
will say “no” to injustice and act
upon it, The question of action
is beautifully juxtaposed with
the problem of obeying the law.
Buford represean both ends, a
man dedicated to defending the
very laws which hamper him,
fighting the men who have so
warped these laws to their own
use so as to have no respect for
their enforcement. Yet he is a
man who won't be held down, a
man who will, quite legally, in~
stall public toilets in the cham-
bers of a crooked jUdge, a man
who will inform a prisoner of his
various rights (arrested for a
brutal torture) and punch him in
the groin with each one,

This is a violent picture, but it
is also an iiislriiclch one, 'I‘lic
violence here is not used for
shock value, or to inciti- spccula
|ion about thc nature of the

 

 

man. Walking ’I‘ull reminds us of
the practical nature of violence
as used to stop the killers by
their own methods. Such acLs
are painful to watch, and we are
reminded that things are very
had here indeed, when Buford's
nine year old son, riﬂe in hand,
must guard his wounded father's
hospital bed. 'I‘hat's where it
ends, when the ordinary citizen
waits too long for the hero to
arrive.

Butterfield 8. Better Days

By Kevin Daniels

Few people who have I'Vt'l‘
graced the stage or studio can
match the quality and the sweet
ness of Paul ButLErfivltl's Vtit'tils
and harmonica playing. Having
an amazing lung capacity (and
being definitely the best liar-
monica player in the Northeast
today), "Butter" is in good form
with the hornless “Better Days "
Featured was much of their
latest album of the same name
v-“Better Days"«— consisting of
Butterfield, Ronnie Barron,
Amos Garrett, Geoff Muldar,
Chris Parker, and Billy Rich.
They were made for each other,
for as each of them comple-
ments the whole Very well.

As the show progressed. we
heard from their latest. album
“Buried Alive in the Blues,“ a
Nick Gravvnites song featuring
Muldar on electric piano and
Barron on piano with Amos (lai-
rett. playing lead guitar, all quitt-
well. The following “Highway
28" was quite notable being in
itself biographical in nature
“Broke My Baby's Ileari" gave
Ronnie Barron a eliancc to show

his Vocal abilities on this his own
composition and it sounded
good t‘Vl'tI without the soft brass
that i.- on the recorded Version
of this t'lIl “Ni-w Wnlkin Blues"
showed Us Butterficld on “11'
piano for a while with Muldiir's
slidc gtiilar complementing (Ear
rolls lezitl guitar movements
And, actually, the most movmu
of all the pieces rendered was
the beautiful Bobby Charles

After a notably brief set, liui

applause, sliowmg how well thi-
band wzts received, and the band
played lIII't't' songs in the encore,

show went off fairly smoothly in
the Armory, despite a small
lapse in a spot that sent Muldar
screaming “Fix the damn
sound!" At one time during
“Small Town Talk“ and there
was the most obviously notable
“lack of evacuation procedures
necessary" which might open
the Armory more and more to
the public for more diversified
events. All that went down was
most satisfying and totally ex-
hilt-rating.
