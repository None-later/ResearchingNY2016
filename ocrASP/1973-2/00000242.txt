Trucksters Triumph Again; Stand 12-0

by John Koch

For a team member, it was
tiring and disheartening. For
Coach Munsey, it was a night-
mare. No, the track team did not
lose. They defeated Stony
Brook, Binghamton, and U. of
Buffalo in Saturday’s meet. But
it was the end of a very long and
tiring week of competition.

Slightly fatigued from spen-
ding the spring break in Albany,
the tracksters traveled to Platts-
burgh Wednesday, easily winning
a triangular meet. To add to the
long afternoon and evening
rides, the team bus broke down
due to a lack of water in the
engine.

Saturday the Danes left at
8:00 to take a ‘short' day hop to
Binghamton (l consider it to be

a long trek when the importance

 
 

of the contest is taken into
account). And, as fate would
have it, the bus broke down
again. As a result, the team
arrived only twenty minutes
before the start of the meet.
Even the weather would not
cooperate. it was a cold and
rainy day at Harpur and these
factors led to the poorest Dane
performance of the season.

The Munseymen did finish the
day on the winning end of ii
73-51Vz-34-17‘h score in the
‘University Center' quadrangular
meet. Stony Brook finished
second and host Binghamton
was third. Team depth was again
Albany's trump suit as the first
three squads split the sixteen
gold performances evenly.

Albany‘s five first places were
scored by the team's more con-

sistent members. The mile relay
quartet (Tim Bilash, Rich
Hower, Tom Crowley, and Sal
Rodriguez) won their specialty
with a 3:29 clocking. Rudy Vldo
set a track record in the shot put
with a toss of 51'1/4". High
jumper Bob Malone, who is
having a fine season, led his
event with a 6‘2" leap. Distance
ace Jim Shrader broke his own
team record and the track record
in the three mile run with a time
of 14:13.

The fifth Dane win came from
John Streeter, who won the
intermediate hurdles. ‘Streetcar'
also finished a close second in
the triple jump, and as a result
was given the team's 'fickle
feather' as the best Dane per-
former.

Sprinter Cliff McCairg had a
tough day, taking second ill hoth
(lashes to II Stony Brook runner.
McCrirg injured his font three
weeks riin iii a freak accident
and has not hot-n ill)l(‘ to run
hI-rivy workouts.

It. would l)l’ nl(‘l‘ it' thr- team
could sit. hack and lolik at the
past week. llowr-vr-r, thr-
pressure is at its peak this wet-ll.
This afternoon at 11 PM, the
Danes host Williams College in
the final durrl must of the
season. As strange. as it may
seem, the State trucksters arc the
underdogs in this contest.
Williams has a very tough squad
and the Danes are still hurting,

mentally and physically, from
the last three weeks of a grueling
schedule.

Friday morning the squad
leaves for Fredonia, the sight of
the SUNY conference champion-
ship. The eleven team field may
find it tough dethroning Cort-
land, the 1972 winners. Brock-
port is favored with the
defending champs. Oneonta and
Albany have the only remote
chances of upsetting the two
phys. ed. schools.

The team schedule after the
conference meet has not been
finalized. The Athletic Advisory
Board has granted the team
monies to attend the Upstate
New York Track Champion-
ships, to he held at R.l.'l‘. on
May 12. A decision will be
reached early next week as to

the number of Albany entries.
Individuals who qualify for the
IC4A (Rutgers University), and
National (Wabash College) Track
Championships have also been
voted funds for these contests.
At the present time, three men
have qualiﬁed for these meets.
Rudy Vido has qualiﬁed in the
shot put with his 52'7" toss. In
the 100, Cliff McCarg has mel
that standard with his 9.7
second time. Three miter Jim
Shrader has broken the [4:20
qualifying mark three times this

season.

Final dual meat of the season

today - Albany vs. Williams
College at 3 PM at the track.

SUNYA Boots Western Historian I

by Rick Ginsberg
News Analysis
Special to the ASP

Dr. David Goodman has been
an assistant professor in the His-
tory Department since 1968. His
contract is to expire this Spring.
Rather than wait until his ﬁnal
year of contract, Goodman de-
cided to attempt to gain pro-
motion and tenure in the Fall of
1971.

In October of 1971, the his-
tory department met on Good-
man’s case, and the rcsult of
their vote was negative. Good-

  
     

man’s scholarship was consi-
dered deficient by the depart-
ment, his teaching only “com-
petent,” and his University ser-
vice questionable.

In his letter to Associate Dean
of Arts and Sciences, Paul
Wheeler, Kendall note that,
“Mr. Goodman’s book, A
Western Panorama: The Travels,
Writings, and Inﬂuence of .1.
Ross Browne...is a basically
immature study of a figure who
is of secondary importance in
American History." He adds that
it is not a “significant work of

 

scholarship."

This harsh treatment of Good-
man’s topic and the work itself
was refuted by many nationally
known historians. Howard
Lamas, the Chairman of the His-
tory Department at Yale Univer-
sity considers Ross Browne of
considerable significance. J.
Golden Taylor, the editor of
Western American Literature, re-
viewing Goodman ’s book, states,
“The present work is really
somewhat overdue, for although
the career and writing of J. Ross
Browne provide some of the

 
 

most authentic. revelations of
major aspects of life in the West
during the turbulent quarter cen-
tury following the Gold Rush,
his significance has not before
been fully assessed." Several
prestigious Western scholars do
not agree with the letter for-
warded by Kendall. Also in this
transmittal, Kendall wrote there
was a question about Goodman's
competence as a graduate
teacher. This is based on only
one graduate course taught by
Dr. Goodman, and when student
evaluations were elicited, they

 

 

WMM

were overwhelmingly positive.
in regards to Dr. Goodman’s
other book, Arizona Odyssey.
Dr. Kendall notes it is a good
volume of bibliography, but it is
not a work of historical inquiry.
Again, notable historians refute
this, among them Paul Buck of
Harvard, who feels bibliography
is a Valuable tool and proper
venture for an historian. Sidney
B. Brinckerhoff of the Arizona’s
Pioneer’s Historical Society calls
Arizona Odyssey "an essential
volume. not only for libraries
