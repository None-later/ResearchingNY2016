The 1973 commencement will
be somewhat of, as Alice Corbin,
Commencement Coordinator
puts it, a “mini open house."
Though the actual commence-
ment exercises will take place on
Saturday, May 26, there will be
a number of other activities dur-
ing the weekend for both the
graduating students and guests.

To begin, on Friday night, May
25 at 8:30 there will be the
torch ceremony, a traditional
event. President Benezet and the
president of the alumni assoc-
iation will both speak. The torch
ceremony serves two functions.
One is to welcome seniors into
the alumni association. The
other, the passsing of the
torches, or candles by seniors to
underclassmen serves a symbolic
function. Seniors invite under-
classmen to be their torch-
bearers. The ceremony will take
place on the front steps of the
university between the Adminis-
tration and Fine Arts buildings.

On Saturday the events will
begin at 10:30 AM starting with
a University Wind Ensemble
Concert in front of the Per-

Antioch College Strike: Poor Are Ignore

('3

PS

Students at Antioch College
went on srike April 20 in protest
against President Nixon‘s pro-
posed funding cuts for financial
aid to college students, and the
Antioch adninistration's failure
"to meet commitments made to
poor and minority peoples at
Antioch."

The basic complaint is that
since 1070 the administration
and board of trustees at the
college have actively recruited
poor and minority students. but
are now ignoring those students‘
problems in continuing to attend
Antioch.

Feeling a need to nroaden the
ethnic and minority base of
students participating in social
change programs at Antioch, the
college instituted a New Direc-
lions Program in the summer of
1070 aduilling 145 poor and
minority students. Many of
those admitted had no money.
and were on a “total nccd"
basis.

The New Directions Program
has continued but students
maintain that 11 has been a con
stunt battle on their part to keep
11 going. There have been several
confrontations With the admin-
lslltllltlll, including a strike in

ltllt‘ 1071). for a statement of

commitment from the admin-
istration.

Leaders in the current strike
said they are afraid that Pres-
ident Nixon‘s threatened im-
poundrrent of funds allocated to
college financial aid programs
will result in serious cutbacks in
existing aid programs at Anti.
och. Antioch has birdgetcd
$300,000 to assist students re-
quiring financial aid next year,
but sonic students aid they
would be forced to withdraw
from the school or go itrto dcbt
by getting high interest bank
loans if government aid pro-
grams arc curtailed.

Although Congress has approvv
ed funds for several student li-
nancial aid programs April 18.
overriding President Nixon's pri-
orities. students say they are still
not satisfied.

“We expected a higher
amount to be allotted to finan-
cial ind." saris one student. “but
lllCIL is still less availablc to
colleges and students presently
getting money.“ lie pointed out
that Congress had approved the
same amount of moue) that
President Nixon had appointed
to student financial aid. and [hit
more moneywould he needed to
:rdcquntcly provide for poor and
working class students going to

cipate m the events on another
campus til the same prrcc ptrid
by students at the sponsoring
\chool. It would also encourage
greater cooperation in planning
concerts and other major events

my system.

Easier Admittance

University‘s four year colleges

college.

Students told Antioch Pres-
ident James P. Dixon that they
would go on strike if he did not
set up a meeting between college
trustees and a group of students
receiving financial aid. Dixon re-
fused to set up the meeting.

Students then issued a state-
rnenl explaining their decision to
strike:

“New Directions students are
still lacking a solid guarantee
that their status as students is
sccure. The administration
stated a year ago that New Di-
rections is its first priority. 11 is
time now to apply pressure to
the adninistration again to re»
new their cornniitrneril to New
Directions’ financial and stir
dents."

The students are demanding
that college trustees sign a legal
contract guaranteeing that the
college's existing financial aid
program qill conlirriic rirrtil all
students currently enrolled and
requiring financial aid have grad
urrtcd. About onc-lhird of all
Antioch students receive fintm»
curl aid.

To ensure than llrc \lllkL’ is
effective. members of the strike
committee have barricaded illl
buildings on campus and havc

be a "modest change."

He said that applications to the
University ('cnters Albany.

before. wlirlc applications to the
technical and agricultural col-
leges has increased somewhat.

instance, several students were
bodily removed when they
attempted to use the school
gym.

The adninistration to date has
failed to take a stand on the
strike, and President Dixon has
been out of town. The board of
trustees is expected to hold a
meeting April 27, but the presi-
dent of the Antioch-system
issued a directive saying that the
strike is a local matter and
should not be dealt with by the
board of trustees.

Faculty have been split on the
issue. There have been several
faculty meetings. and some pro-
fessors have cancelled classes
while others have arranged to
hold classes elsewhere.

Student body reaction to the
strike has been mixed. There was
some question as to how closing
down the school will affect the
cafeteria workers. who struck
for live wccks last winter when
33 employees wcrc laid off by
the college.

Students asked how the cafe-
lcrizr workers could expect to be
paid if the school is closed. and
were reassured that the strike
committee was working with the
calctcrrria workers‘ union. The
cafeterias have been kept open
and \ludcnls are being served

dormitory beds. and said that
the University is dorng "every-
thing possible” to utiltve the
c.\llit \pncc I’icscnlly. only
about ‘Ll'r’ of the dorm \prrcc at
University campuses is filled.

l11 order to deal with this
situation, Boyer says the Univer-
sity has developed four alterna-
tivcs:

cold meals.

Many of Antioch‘s 1100 stu-
dents are unsure about support-
ing the strike because they feel
the issue is nation-wide. and that
a strike at one school won‘t
affect those who have decision
making power about the issue of
presidential impoundmerit of cd-
ucational funds. Strike leaders
counter that regardless of
Nixon's economic cuts it is the
school's responsibility to provide
for students already enrolled
there.

Some students say they are
tired from the cafeteria workers‘
strike last quarter which also
polarized the school, and some
seniors, anxious to gel the re-
maining credits necessary to
graduate. are nol willing to miss
class,

Other students argue that it
would be more reasonable to
delay the strike until the
Supreme (‘ourl rules whether
Nixon‘s irnpoundrnenl of educa-
tional funds is legal. If the ruling
is in the students‘ favor. they
say. then the strike will have
