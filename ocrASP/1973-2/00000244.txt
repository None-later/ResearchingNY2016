Down in the depths below the
lecture centers. among the laby-
rinth of tunnels and corridors,
lies the everpresent, but little
known Educational Communica-
tion Center. It is here that the
busy teams of ECCworkers
produce many of the films,
recordings and graphics seen and
heard in classes.

According to Acting Director
William Mulvey, the ECC felt
lost a year ago, but now is
meeting more faculty and
students. An overview of what
the ECC offers was sent to the
faculty. According to this, the
purpose of the ECC is to
“further the cause of instruc-
tion.” This is done with its
services, and instructional
development.

The services include films.
audio visual. repair, listening
laboratory, television and audio
recording, graphics and still
photography. and film produc-
tion.

Instructional development is
deﬁned as “ a rather long term

cooperative commitment
between the Educational Com-
munication Center and a depart-
ment or professor for the
purpose of carefully and
properly mediating a sequence
of study or a full course of

study.” ECC is invited to
become involved in aspects of
planning.

Mulvey believes the key to
instructional development is the
long term committment between
the ECC and the professor
in an effort to develop
something “instructionally
sound."

Now underway is the produc-
tion of a film of triggered
lightening on a Digicol color
analyzer. In cooperation with
Dr. Richard Orville of the
atmospheric science department.
cinematographer Carl Howard
has filmed lightening on a closed
circuit T.V. color camera which
takes a black and white image
and breaks it down in up to 33
shades of color. The color
coding shows the density of the

lightening. ’
According to Dr. Orvrlle,
15/ l 000 of a second of

lightening is equal to 1 minute
of film.ln another atmospheric
science project, Dr. Orville Will
have photographs ofseveral days
of a storm over the NY. area
seen in a film of a few minutes.

Howard’s job is to take the
idea of the professor through the
entire filming process -— writing,
editing. He has just completed
two, half-hour films on four
internationally known sculpters
for the art department. ,

A new teaching method is the
Phillips Norelco I’.I.P. machine
which rises sirrwr 8mm ﬁlm and
audio cassettes It works by an
electrical impulse which starts
and stops the film along with the
narration. Students could use
this on their own time and go to
the instructor for further
assistance. In theory, Mulvey
believes the “Instructor would
have much more personalcontacl
With the students because he's
there when they need litrrr.
Bruce Marsh of the Physics

 

 

Department is preparing material
fora problem solving course that
will be using this equipment.
The students would receive a
homework assignment, and the
machine would present the solu-
tions, but require active parti-
cipation by the student. Marsh
sees these new methods as
playing “an increasingly impor-
tant role.“ which would “free
the instructor to do the more
important and difﬁcult part of
education." So far the PIP
machine is only on use at Brock-
port and Broome County Tech.

ECC produced the film for the
Community Service Program,
various prorects for the intro-
ductory KCU course, the experi-
mental pliilosophy course. and
many others.

ECC is asked to do many
non-university projects because
their staff is so professional. but
this business must be turned
down because its charge is to
support rnstructiorr. Costs for
ECC productions are usually
split between the center and the

New Grading Policy Effective Fall ’73; 5/0, A/E Offered

by Sue Leboff

SUNYA will have a new
grading policy in the fall. This
latest episode in the apparently
endless grading wrangle is a com-
promise between faculty.
students and administrators who
advocate total Sill for freshmen
and sophomores and those who
oppose any use of S/U grading at

second ﬁeld.

Courses which are designated
by a department ats S/U, such as
physical education and English
Composition, do not count as
part of the 30 creditallowance.
Thus, a student in the English
Departmental Program, which
includes 24 credits of depart~
mentally designated S/U courses,
can take 140 additional credits
S/U, including six more in his or
her major If this not-necessarily~
hypothetical student entered
SUNY With six S/U advanced
credits in English, he or she
could graduate as an English
major With all 36 credits In the
major S/U.

The partial S/U policy is the
most common grading innova~
tron in the country; it is also one
of the hardest to Justify philo-
sophically. The theory behind
total S/U is that it Will
encourage instructors and
students to discover IlanV‘dllVP
mvthods of teaching, learning
and l‘VltIUallt)", and replace thr-
goal of an acceptable grade with
the goal of the acquisition uf
knowledge in thl' student's
mrnrl. Adhr-rvrrts of A/E grading
can argue that competition,

pressure and evaluation are
psychological necessities if one is
to learn anything in a course.

But partial A/E, partial S/U
fits poorly into any theory of
education. Schools which adopt
the half and half policy can hope
that it will encourage students to
use their S/U allowance to
explore areas that they would
hes'itate to take A/E, lrut,
according to one study,
“research indicates that three
fourths or more of the students
who use the puss-fail option
would havu taken the course
anyway”. The fact that in
schools using the partial system,
students on S/U and students on
A/E attend the same classes
makes innovation nigh impos-
sible, instead of devising new
methods of learning and
evaluating, professors must goar
their courses toward conven~
tional Ar’l‘l grading, and merely
convert to S/U for some
students.
