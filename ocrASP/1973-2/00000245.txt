and schools. but for anyone in-
terested in the fascinating and
varied history of the state." In
none of Kendall’s remarks is
there any discnssion of the
favorable reviews.

As a result of this meeting of
the department and the sub-
sequent letter by Kendall. con-
cerned students began to come
to Dr. Goodman's defense.
Several hundred letters were
written to Associate Dean
Wheeler. all in Goodman's favor.
The History Student’s Associa-
tion met and Dr. Kendall agreed
to meet with the students. Ken-
dall did mention that he was not
expressing his opinion, but that
of the department. Kendall em-
phasized that his job was to
forward the opinions of the de~
partment.

The next step in the process
was the meeting of Dean Huns-
berger’s Committee on Promov
tion and Continuing Appoint
ment. The committee voted 3-3
on the case. One member of the
committee remarked privately to
Dr. Goodman that he would
have had all the votes but three
people felt he should wait until
his mandatory year. Dean Huns-
berger's letter of December 27,
1971 mentioned that the depart-
ment would have preferred to
withhold judgment. Ilurtsberger
noted that the committee felt
Goodman‘s teaching and scholar-
ship had been proven compe~
tent, and that the department
should decide what to do With
the ﬁeld of the west Dean Hum.
berger himself felt that Dr
Goodman‘s books were not good
enough, and that his contribu‘
tion in advanced courses wasn't
clear.

Following all of these negative
outcomes. Dr. Goodman had a
conversation wrth President
Benezet. in January of 1972
Benezet told Goodman that he
should be optimistic Ile asked
Goodman not to release infor
mation to the ASP or the Times
Union because legislators would
react. and SL'NYA could be only
hurt lie continued by making it
clear that he and Vice President
Sirotkin could not help Good-
man .that year They did feel

thede l‘rermomibititytogood
teaching. Interatingly. four
months after this meeting. Bene-
Zet sent a letter to Goodman
saying he was just speaking to
Goodman as a colleague, not as
President. it seems 303th said
a few thinﬁ out of place.

The next step after Huns~
berger's letter, was the Univer-
sity Committee's meeting
chaired by Dr. Cannon in
February of 1972. The commit-
tee's vote was split, but went

against Dr. Goodman. This com-
mittee’s recommendation goes
from the Vice-President to the
President. Recently. it has been
learned from one member of Dr.
Cannon‘s committee, that the
committee as a whole generally
favored Goodman's case. and
would have voted him tenure.
but felt that he had come up too
early. Nobody. the committee
had informally decided, should
getearly tenure. They felt that if
they had agreed on promotion.
that would justify tenure. so
both were denied. This reporter
personally met with Dr. Cannon.
and he related that Goodman
had a strong Case. and should
have no trouble in the future.
The University Committee then
gave a negative recommendation.

At this time. Peter Zimmer~
man, a Goodman supporter. met
with President Benezet and
asked him questions on the pro-
cedure. Benezet replied by let-
ter: “The general rule remains
that a professor's future is and
should be decided by his peers in
his department."

During the hearing of the Uni-
Versrty Committee. Goodman
was only allowed a few minutes
to speak. Dr. Cannon agreed to
give Dr. Goodman another hear-
ing. Later in February. the com-
mittee met again. Goodman was
given one week to solicit letters
concerning his work -» not much
time considering his books
would have to be read. com‘
merited on. and reviews returned
in writing. Yet, there were seve-
ral replies. Iluward Lamar of
Yale said. "'Ihe J. Ross Browne
biography is a well researched
and much need study of a signi-
ﬁcant Western figure " Itobert
Utley, chief historian of the
National Parks Scrvu'e. swote,
“Arizona Odyssey is an impor~
tant contribution to western
Americana and. with earlier

min; mark; the anuior. Dr.
David Goodman, :- a who!" of
high J1!!!“ and distinction.”
Apia, however. the committee
went against Goodman. These
mim 'ﬂe glossed over and
ignored. Benmt agreed with the
committee. On March 14.
Matthews. Dean for Personnel,
sent a letter to Goodman in-
forming him of the denial by
Benezet and the University Com-
mittee, but added that no one
got early tenure and that Good-
man should wait for reconsider-
ation at a later time.

About this time. several in-
terested students met with Bene
zet conerning Goodman's case.
the Praident was very cordial,
and impressed everyone with the
importance of due process. He
reminded them of the work-
ability of our system here at
SUNYA

In April of 1972. Dr. Good
man was up for contract re-
newal. This procedure is handled
by the department and acted
upon through the Associate
Dean and the President. follow-
ing the recommendation of the
Chairman. Dr. Kendall denied
contract renewal. He based his
reasons on a department vote of
II to 11 and the idea that Dr.
Goodman's work had been
thoroughly evaluated. 'I‘his.
according to several department
members, is not the truth. No
thorough evaluation actually
took place until Fall, 1972. Ken-
dall quoted two of the negative
in his letter to the Associate
Dean and none of the positive
comments. Kendall reports that
in Western Panorama, Goodman
is “uncritical about his source
materials, a failing which
weakens the value of the nami-
live." Kendall comments later.
“...his (Goodman) intellectual
interests include so little of what
ordinarily concerns historians
that I fail to see how he can be a
good teacher of history. Need-
less to say. I would not want Mr.
Goodman to apply his concep
tion of history to the Depart.
ment's advanced students."

In June of 1972, Dr. Goodman
ﬁled several grievances to the
University Grievance Commit
tee. The committee found that
the case was not handled with
complete fairness, They related:
“We make no judgment as to the
Validity of his case for promtr

tion but reconmmd that the
me be reviewed by the presi-
dent.” After reviewing the re-
port of this hearing. Beneut
commented. “My conclusion is
that deliberate prejudice and un-
fairnm in the evaluation of Pro—
fessor D. Goodman for promo
tion to Amociaic Professor have
not been demonstrated in the
hearing board's report. I must
decline therefore to accept his
grievance or to reconsider the
present case for his promotion."
It seems due process is followed,
but adhered to only when desir-
able.

That bring us to this year's
happening. The ﬁrst step was
again the department’s commit-
tee, which met in October of
1972. Somewhat surprisingjy,
the history department went in
Dr. Goodman’s favor. The vote
was 12-9 for tenure and 11-11
for promotion. Interesting. the
votes higher than his own were
10.7 on tenure and 96 on pro-
motion. It does seem possible
that with budgeting so tight.
many of the junior faculty went
against Dr. Goodman to protect
themselves. Once more. it was
Dr. Kendall's job to transmit a
letter to Associate Dean Melvin
Bers. At ﬁrst. Kendall sum-
maried the department feeling.
He ended this section saying, “A
majority of the ranks abOVE and
tenured members believe that on
the basis of his published and
prospective work~--in the
wewest. in philanthropy. in local
history » and his record as a
teacher. Mr. Goodman should be
promoted to and granted a con
tinuing appointment." Yet. the
very next line he writa: "As
Department Chairman. [strong-
ly recommend that Mr. Good‘
man not be promoted or given
tenure." Kendall syas in the let-
ter. “I concur with those
opposed to his candidacy...last
year. The only change has been a
net change of four votes." Ken-
dall's letter was sent to Associate
Dean Bers for recommendation.

Bers agreed with Kendall. Ile
based his opinion on scholarship
deficiencies. Bcrs said his rc-
marks were based on a survey of
some people in the history de-
partment. Bers said that the
more accomplished people find
Goodman wanting. With the
above rank and tenured vote in
Dr. Goodman's l’avor, this seems

Colleges and universities have
chosen a wide variety of meth—
ods to lry and bring the students

Other schools have been liberal-
