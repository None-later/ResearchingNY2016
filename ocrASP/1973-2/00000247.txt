against him. the board concluded, be-

cause he had spied on them.

About four nights after Mohr‘s arrest, a
WAW house was gassed - it couldn‘t be
entered for two weeks.

The surveillance issue did not ﬁrst
surface with the Mohr case. Most students
had been aware of campus surveillance
for some time, in the fall of 1971.
Michael White. a Kent WAW leader
formally proposed an investigation of
campus surveillance. The Student Affairs
Council - composed of students, faculty
and administration - approved it.

When the proposal was taken to Olds.
he prodirced a statement denying illegal
surveillance, which he had been preparing
to release. Finally. however. he agreed to
forrii a committee and iii March, l‘)72, he
did so. The committee dissolved itselfsix
months later with polite implications by
the ﬁve student committee members that
the others would be content with a
whitewash.

A report of the ﬁve sttiderits reveals the
riiain problem was lack of access to raw
data. Apparently Olds had ordered Fyke
to give the committee access to the raw
ﬁles and Fyke had refused. denying
Olds's right to know the details of stir-
veillarice activity. The committee had
been content to revrcw index-card files
and had concluded there were rto iron-
ctirriinal tiles. lhc students. who took
seriously their mandate to discover “the
nature and kinds oi records being kept."

consolidation had already taken place

dents. The activists resent the pacifiers.

Glenn Olds replaced Robert White as
president of Kent in September. 197]. A
former campaign assistant to President
Nixon, Olds was appointed ambassador to
the United Nations Economic and Social
C0unci| soon after Nixon took ofﬁce.
Those who don‘t admire him call him
“the diplomat," or. as one faculty mem-
ber put it, “Olds has the cliches down."

Gordon Keller, a political scientist who
is chairperson of the faculty senate and a
fortner member of the local Civil Liber-
ties Union board. has written. “...the
university‘s response has been essentially
twofold: it has inflated its rhetoric about
reconciliation eveti while the realities of
genuine community and communication
are absent. and it has increased its secur-
ity forces."

University Center

One of the ﬁrst pacifiers was an enor-
mous new University (‘eriter, paid for
with student fees. It is devoted mainly to
lounge areas. meeting rooms arid admini-
strative ofﬁces (“ no! student administr-
ative ofﬁces." Cxujko is quick to point
out). A very small area is devoted to
offices for student organizations, govern-
ment and press. The adnrirristraiors who
sit in the University (‘entei are tliouglri of
as "babysitters." They are intermediaries.
who ttrtist ordirrarrly speak for the stit-
dctit groups to tltc adriiiiirstratiotr.

eventual death of four students and the
wounding of eleven others. Everyone
today has heard of Kent State and what
happened there on May 4th. Few cart say
they experienced it. And still fewer cart
see arty justice coming forth as a result of
those needless d ‘atlis.

When you are actually present at a
catastrophe such as Kent. you are morc
