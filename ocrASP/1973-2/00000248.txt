Philip Tompkins' memories of
the Kent State tragedy are more
speciﬁc than most, more de-
tailed and more deliberate.

But that's understandable.
Philip Tompkins was a faculty
member at Kent State. Follow-
ing the tragedy. he chaired a
special internal task force on
communications set up by the
university president to study the
causes of the shootings.

The tale Dr. Tompkins tells is a
painful one: a story of needless
bloodshed, ofﬁcial uninterest
and university complicity. It is a
story of four students whose
only crime, it seems, was being
at the wrong place at the wrong
time on a fateful day in history.
It is a story of four young
persons who unknowingly sacri-
ficed their lives for nothing more
than what was for many, a pass-
ing, popular, political cause. And
it is a story that, significantly.
has no heroes.

Tompkins served in the Rhet-
oric and Public Communication
Department at Kent State, first
as an instructor and then as
department chairman. The find
ings and recommendations of his
task force were presented to the
UnIVL‘I‘Slly for consideration. The
administration, he asscrLs,
“promptly ignored them." Frus-
trated by the “lack of change" a
year after the tragedy. Tompkins
joined the Rhetoric and Com-
munication department here in
Albany in the fall of 197]. His
findings were later published as a
150 page book entitled (‘oni
muriicaliori (.‘risis ul KI‘II/ Stale.

What the 'I‘ompklns task force
discovered was “unbelieveabli-
ineptitude" Within the (Kent
State! administration," inepti‘

tude that was a major contribu-
tive factor in the four student
deaths.

That conclusion is significant,
says Tompkins, because one in-
vestigative body -— the Scranton
Commission — blamed the
National Guard for the blood-
shed. A second agency — the
local grand jury — blamed the
students. “But both accounts,"
argues Tompkins, “don’t tell the
whole picture." There is still the
matter of university complicity
to be considered. “No one ever
questioned the university’s role
in this." Tompkins adds.

At the heart of the administra-
tive "ineptitude" at Kent State
was the weak governance struc-
ture. Kent State President
Robert 1. White was “literally
invisible" on May I, 2, and Il.
even though, Tompkins says,
“almost everyone knew there
was going to be some sort of
trouble .l.he students had
promised an action," on the
night White left.

When the campus crisis
erupted, there was no individual
clearly in charge because White
consistently refused to delegate
decision making power “in eVen
the most minute case.

Some
vice~presidents Were unaware the
president was out of town, and
others had differing Ideas about
who was in charge in his ab
sence.

Complicating the situation was
the fact that the (Iity of Kent
had a newly-elected Mayor # the
man who ultimately called in the
guard on Saturday without con
suiting anyone at the university
'- who knew no one at Kent
State except President White.

As the situation steadily deteri~
orali-d at Kl'lll during the

bloody weekend of May 1, 2 and
3, communication became mud-
dled. Students trashed stores in
downtown Kent on Friday
night, clashed with National
Guardsmen who were called on-
to the campus on Saturday, and
burned down the ROTC building
on Saturday night. “The univer-
sity." recalls Tompkins, “was
like a driverless car going down-
hill without brakes.” No one was
talking to anyone else. Leader-
ship was absent. Faculty and
students were uninformed. And
city ofﬁcials did not know how
— or with whom '- to deal at the
university.

The most significant finding of
the task force centered around
the prohibition of the right of
assembly - forbidding the right
to gather in groups, ’l‘hat prohi-
bition would provide the later
justification for breaking up the
ill-fated Monday afternoon rally
on the Commons — the rally
that left four dead and eleven
injured. Many studean and fac-
ulty never learned of the prohi-
bition, Tompkins says, because
the administration never
bothered to tell them.

Leaflets announcing the ban
on assemblies were distributed
to some -- but not all * dormi-
tories on Sunday afternoon, and
one announcement had been
made on the campus radio star
tion But classes were ordered
held on Monday and because of
this, confusion developed. Many
faculty shared 'l‘ompkins‘ View:
“It didn't occur to me and to
most others *- that there was no
such thing as assembly,"

The task force found later that
slightly more than half the stu-
dents knew their right of assem»
bly had been prohibited, that

c

the rally was an illegal one. Only
about one third knew that the
Guardsmen's riﬂes contained live
ammunition.

“Some administrators,“ adds
Tompkins, knew of the live
ammunition but took “a non--
responsible reaction to it...thcy
washed their hands of the whole
thing."

More confusion developed over
who had actually ordered the
ban on assemblies. At a Monday
morning meeting in a downtown
firehouse between university and
guard officials, each side thought
the other had ordered the ban.
Tompkins put forth the hy‘
pothesis that remarks by Ohio
Governor James Rhodes made at
a weekend press conference were
misinterpreted by a university
official. The official, thinking
the ban had been ordered, went
ahead and ordered the printing
of the leaflets announcing it.

The general confusion follow-
ing the shooting, coupled with
rumors and with inaccurate press
reports (one local paper reported
twu Guardsmen had been slain
and students were sniping at
Guardsmen) led to the immedi-
ate closing of the university. As
students left, they wore Lhur.

  

u oughiy searched 4 as were their

belongings and rooms. The

search of the 24,000 student
campus yielded a hunting riﬂe, a
shotgun, 60 knives, three sling-
shots and several BB guns.

Tompkins labels the semester
following the shootings “the
hardest period of my life...there
were great feelings of despair."
Classes were rumored to be infil-
trated, tenured faculty and stu-
dents were suspended without
trial or hearings. Tompkins was
convinced there was “a definite
coverup" of the shootings by an
unresponsive administration. A
state grand jury convened and
indicted students and facnlty for
their role in the killings. No one,
Tompkins says, “questioned the
culniibility of the National
Guard." or the performance of
the university in that time of
crisis.

And what of lessons?

“It seems to me," Philip
Tompkins says, "I learned some-
thing about Iiow not to run a
university. But that's obviously
no comparison to the loss (of
student lives-l,"

“What did come of it? Very
little. I’m quite sure the students
didn't want to be martyrs.
