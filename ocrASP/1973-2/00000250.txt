Perhpas one of the most
exciting moments I‘ve spent in a
New York theatre in a good long
time was the evening I journeyed
to the Chelsea Theater in
Brooklyn to see a marvelous
company of singers-dancers-
actors called “El Teatro
Campesino."

What these people could do
which I found to be quite a rare
achievement was tell us the story
of their people in such a
refreshingly joyous manner that
we culd not help but take very
seriously the ardor of these
Chicanos (Mexican-Americans)
and their struggle to improve the
situation today in the migrant
camps, in the barrios (Ghettos).
and in small towns throughout
our country.

Performing in both English and
Spanish (but expressively
enough so that you’ll know what
they‘re talking about regardless
of which language you favor)
“EL Teatro" will present their
first full-length presentation
called "La Carpa de Los
Rasquachis" (The Tent of the

ampesino Comes to Albany

Undardosa). “La Carpa" a work
collectively written by the
15-member troupe" as the news
release points out."is a series of
actos (skits) based on the history
of the Chicano people in the
southwest and Mexico." I might
add that the story deals
specifically with one family who
comes to the United States
seeking a better life in the post-
war era, who soon learn that the
smiles of the friendly farmers
who greeted them as they
crossed the border soon
disappeared if the farmers
thought they were not getting
every last ounce of energy from
these people that they possibly
could.

In a weekend when this
campus has been treated to a
romantic, musical look at life
amoung grape harvesters in
California‘s Napa Valley in the
form of our musical extrav-
aganza “Most Happy Fella". it's
quite nice to hear from a group
of actors who have actually
picked those grapes. These are
actors who can sing,perhaps a
bit more honestly, about the

lady Dogcatchers?

You would never have heard
the phrase "women's lib" if
women had received a fair shake
from employers.

Other grievances are of mini-
mal consequence by comparison.
What justified the uproar was
the fact that more than a third
of our nation's workers are
women-- but they still get the
jobs men don‘t want. And only
rarely is her pay equal to his.

Willi the Equal Rights Amend-
ment just il handful of states
away from ratification, those op-
poscd are ri-viving thc argument
that women “must be protch-
cd" from (liingcrous. strenuous
work.

In technical or physically dc-
mrinding jobs, 1.5 million
womcn :irc pi-i-scnlly proving

Why dirty their hands? Money,

Marilyn Bi-is works as a car
pcnlcr's apprentice for $5.62 an
hour In less than threc years. as
it Journeyman carpenter, shc'll
l‘ilrll $0.10 an hour,

Beth Briggs still works for thc
{ch-phone company, but shi-
switched from u desk job to
construction-for $25 a wcck

ln Lakcland. Fla, two petite

Long Beach, Calif.. has a lady

Oakland. Calif.. and Ann
Arbor, Mich., are using police-
women--for unrestricted slrccl
patrol.

Coed Kathy Piipapanos of Lon
sing. Mich.. is a highway con-
struction engineer.

Blue collar jobs are no longer

While the Equal Rights
Amendment was undcr consider-
ation in Arkansas' legislature.
Sen. Mutt Jones talked it down.
He said, “You don‘t want to sm-
those swcet and tender little
bodies with builds torn off by
shrapnel."

He said, “Women are put on

nccds of miscriiblc mcn. "

this ugly history of child abuse in
the Washington area.

'l'hc tragedy is not limited to
the District of Columbia, or to
t‘lLiiss, or to poor people. Indeed.
child abuse cuts across all social.
economic and geographic strata.
The problem has attained ularm-
ing proportions. Around 700
deaths related to child abuse
occur each year in the United

iiillc.igui-

50.000 to
abuse

States. Another
200,000 suffer physical
every year.

In New York City alone. ac-
cording to Jule M. SugarmanI
head of the city's Human Re-
sources Administration, more
than 10,000 cases of child
neglect or abuse wcrc reported
last year. Many times that num-
bcr wcnl unrcporli-d. One pro-
Vision of Humphrcy's bill would
require doctors, nurses, school-

In any event, and primarily its
a result of llumphri-y‘s and Mon-

tragedy of child abuse has been
brought into national locus for
the first tiinc in recent years.
Field hearings continua in Monv
dale's «subcommittee, and it is
likely that legislation will reach
the Senate floor sometime this
year.
