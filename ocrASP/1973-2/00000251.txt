Grease drips off your Submarine,
Mouthfulls of lettuce shreds.
The fluid Saturday nights

of flitty young things,

eyes like rented lightbulbs.“

All smoke—eod up and waiting

for the light show of neuclear war.

In communes that smell

of babyshit,

in dark rooms where slender Fords
needle up the highway of the arm
We are massing.

Cheap wine pude on a picnic table,
the troops limber up (and down)

upanddown in the long grass,

by the river where

the beer tin flotilla
passes peerlessly
unquestionably defiant.

After Pound and Joyce und
Faulkner it's hard for these l’lllO
to accept a genius who practi-
cally comes off as it hack in his
Science-fiction based genre. A
large part of the book contains a
discussion of the idea: [5 Vonne—
gut ii Sci-Fi writer and, if he is,
who in hell cures'.7 Too often our
college courses tire submerged in
the past (eg. Modern Phil ends
with Kant; 20th Century Am.

gives us it feel of what is going
on in literature Ioday and tho
interchanges und interactions be-
