The Year in Review

Once again Albany State varsity teams turned in an outstanding
season. This was especially true with Football, Basketball, and Track
and Field.

The football team was the big surprise this season. Not much was
expected of the football teamwhen practice opened but the team gelled
as the season progressed. They came within three minutes of an
undefeated season, finishing 6-1-1. The highlight of the season
probably came near the end of the Hudson Valley game when
Albany's goal line defense held to give the Danes a 16-14 victory.
Next year, its a whole new season with the Danes going varsity. The
team should have a good future ahead of them with Coach Ford at
the helm.

The soccer team had its usual high hopes before the season started
but ended up in a familiar position, winning only once. The
Cross-Country team came up with Vinnie Reda to replace Brian
Quinn and the Harriers had their usual fine season, winning the
SUNYACs for the second straight year.

Doc Sauers came up with his eighteenth straight non-losing season
but the basketball fell short of an NCAA bid. The Dimes provided
the school with many thrills. During one week, Albany polished off
the fourth best College Division team, Brockport, plus Potsdam in
front of their home fans. Still Albany had its problems on the road
which really hurt their chances for a bid. The Danes ended up
hosting the first ECAC upstate tournament but lost in the finals to
Union. Even though Albany finished 17-8, it was still a disappointing
year.

The wrestling team was another surprise, as they posted a fine 8-3
record. Larry Mims had an outstanding year and Rudy Vido gave the
crowd alot to cheer about in the heavyweight division. The
swimming team once again had their problems, many times lacking
enough men to field a complete team,

Coach Bob Munsey and the track team keep rolling right along.
Tuesday they finished their regualr season to end undefeated. The
lacrosse team, who are normally used to success, are‘ struggling this
year due to inexperience and will probably how their first losing
season ever. The baseball team has been going along at a 500. pace
this spring but they still lead the SUNY conference because of their
fine fall record. Jack Leahy is having another fine season and has
hopes of playing pro ball next year. Coach Bob Lewis'tennis team
was beaten for the first time Tuesday. They now stand at 3-1.

Congratulations to Byron Miller and Bob Ford on winning the
1972-73 ASP athlete and coach of the year awards. 1 would like to
personally thank all fo the players and coaches. 1 know the ASP
sports page has sometimes been critical of the teams but we realize
that they are certainly doing the best they can.

Sorry About That

Being Sports Editor. I always wondered if people really read the
sports page. After Wednesday night I know for sure. It really seems
the folks own at Channel 17 got basketball and hockey mixed up
and I relayed that false information about the Knick game to you. l
am really sorry. I appreciated most of the phone calls from you
except the one at six in the morning.

It‘s been a fun year. I hope we can do it again next year.

Trackmen Finish Unbeaten;
Tap Williams 93-52

by John Koch

The Albany State track team
finished an unblemished dual
meet season with a 93-62 home
victory Tuesday over Williams
College. A fairly large crowd was
on hand to watch the Danes
easily overpower their guests and
record their thirteenth win of
the 1973 campaign.

There was a cautious attitude
by the team before the contest,
which had been billed by Coach
Munsey as being very close. This
was not Very evident as Albany
won by its second largest margin
this season. Perhaps the Dane
mentor should use more effec-
tive scouting methods in the
future.

The (one of the meet was set in
the first event. Rudy Vido led a
1.213 sweep of the shot put
giving Albany an early nine
point lead. The Munseymen
widened their lead when Cliff
McCarg and Mike Okurily tied
for first in the long jump. The
1140 relay team gave Albany five
more points in winning their
event. Thus, after three events,
the Danes were leading 22-1.

Williams then made their only
serious threat of the day, The
Massachusetts school‘s pole
vaulters took the first two spots
in that contest; distance runner
Jay Haug placed first in the mile;
the high hurdlch snatched the
top two positions, This left
Albany with a six point lead.
Williams did not get any closer.

State opened up a sixteen
point gap when Paul Guttman

Bilash and Sal Rodrigues placed
in that event. Frosh Bilash ran
his best time of the season, 50.0,
which is only .1 seconds from
the track record.

John Sti'eeter and Dave Rey-
nolds broke Lin: team record in
the triple jump with leaps of
“‘9 3/4" and 44'4 3/4" res-
pectively. With their first and
second place points, the meet
was all but over for Williams.
With the pressure off the Albany
team as a whole, individuals
really went to town.

Freshman Tom Crowley, who
had sprained his ankle Monday
afternoon, won the half mile in a
quick 1:58.13. ‘Crow,’ who has
had trouble in pacing his races,
let the Williams men set the first
quarter tempo. He then passed
the trio of opponents and held
his lead throughout the gun lap,

Cliff McCarg won both sprints
in his last meet on the home
track, in addition to anchoring
the 11110 relay quartet and win-
ning the long jump. Four wins in
a meet is an indication of the
strength and competetiveness in
the Albany senior,

Two miler Jim Shrader again
ran a qualifying time for post
season competition with a 9:15
clocking. Shrader led the race
until the final lap when William's
Haug passed him. Haug broke
the existing tuck record with :i
time of 9:08. To get an indica-
tion of the consistency in pacing
each lap of a two mile race,
Shrader reeled off quarters of
(if), 68, 70,70, 70, 71,71, and
71) seconds.

You might think that one
school record was a good day‘s
work. It wasn't good enough for
John Streeter, who also set ii
new standard in the intermediate
hurdles. His Williams opponent,
running much faster times
throughout the season, lost his
steps on one hurdle and seemed
to be in trouble. Unfortunately
for Albany, he regained his
tempo and broke the tape .2
seconds ahead of Streeter, who
ﬁnished with a 56.3 time. Then
Scotia junior also recorded his
fastest quarter mile time as part
of the winning mile relay quar~
tet. Sal RoRodriguez had the
fastest split for the Albany win-
ners, 50.0.

The single performance that
left most of the spectators gasp-
ing was turned in by senior
Tom Moore. Moore has been
doing consistently well in (he
javelin, and Won the meet
against Queens with his dramatic
record-setting toss two weeks
ago. He really sent the splinter
ﬂying Tuesday and broke his
own team record by 211 feet! Ill
winning the event with a 21-1‘7“
fling, Moore qualiﬁed for both
the 101A and National track
championships. As a compari-
son, Moore’s best effort last year
was 163‘.

In winning all 13 decisions this
season, the tracksters will start
the 1974 campaign with a win
skcin of 18. The Munseymcn
have now beaten 47 of their liisl
‘18 opponents and will in-

ASP: What makes you think you're good enough?
JACK: Hitting. My hitting is my biggest asset.
ASP: Have you faced anyone really good?

JACK: 2 guys - Rich Fusari, now playing AA ball for the Phillies - I faced him in my
freshman year and went 0-2. Also, Dave LeMancyzk last year -

relief pitcher for the Tigers.

ASP: The baseball draft is in June. What would you say your chances are of getting

drafted?

JACK: I‘d say that my chances would be slim. Coach Burlingame has sent my stats to
all scouts who‘ve asked him if he has anyone he'd consider major league potential. If no
one drafts me, I'd like to go down to Florida in the spring, walk into a camp, and see
how I compare. I’d try to find a team not deep in catching. The catcher 1 replaced here,

ASP: What have you proved to yourself while you 've been here?

JACK: I‘ve proved to myself that I can be a consistent hitter. 1 proved it in the
summer leagues also. Last summer I hit .345 for the Schaefer Brewers in the Albany

ASP: How long would you give yourself a chance to make it?

JACK: As long as I'm progressing, I‘ll continue. Everything‘s been picking up this year
