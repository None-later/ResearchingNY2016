Special to the ASP

It has recently been learned
thatwhile Dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences at the Univer-
sity of Massachusetts, 1. Moyer
Hunsberger allegedly opened the
personal mail of some of his
subordinates.

According to Professor Ryan
Drum, who has since left the
Massachusetts School. one of the
major reasons Hunsberger was
forced to resign from U Mass is

"purge" to cttd acadcrriic
freedom on this campus. It was
the third consecutive day til
such expressed public concern.

because ‘he was “caught illegally
opening - other people’s mail."
Drum says that much of the
other University politics Huns-
berger was engaged in was “not
totally unexpected among some
of us" but that it was “shocking
to everyone" that Hunsberger
was allegedly engaging in such
activities.

Drum says that he was one of
the “victims” of this alleged mail
opening, and that Hunsbergcr

had a personal vendetta against
him because of the popularity of
the courses he taught. He claims
that oftentimes his classes were
overﬂowing with students who
were not even enrollled in his
courses, and that “Hunsberger
did not like this." He claims that
Hunsberger “tried to shut me
up" and. in a telephone conver-
sation yesterday, he said that
Hunsberger refused to confer
w"h him about the controversy

surrounding the courses he
taught.

Apparently, the discovery that
Hunsberger had been allegedly
opening mail came when he be-
gan to make public statements
containing information which
appeared only in the personal
letters which he supposedly
