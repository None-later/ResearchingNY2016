the gap to be ﬁlled by tlte NSF

The Biology Department. on

grant money to be used for

for improving the quality of the

tion expected these cuts to be
rriade up for by the NSF money.

Dr. Allen says that he com-
plained “bitterly” to the admini-
stration about the cuts. He
claimed that department was
“digging its own grave” since the
grant lasts for only ﬁve years.
After the ﬁfth year, he says the

JERUSALEM

When Joshua fought the battle
of Jericho 3,000 years ago to
win the Promised Land for the
Jews, he set up headquarters at
Gilgal near the River Jordan.
Today, countless wars later, Gil-
gal lives again.

The long-vanished Biblical post
is a Jewish settlement on occu-
pied Arab land, where young
lsraeli soldier-farmers grow
tomatoes and guard against Arab
guerrilla inﬁltrators. It is tiny,
but it is symbolic.

Modern Israel, which cele-
brated its 25th anniversary May
7, still relies, like Joshua, on
armed forces to maintain a
Jewish state in the Middle East.
It has won three wars against
huge odds, and is ready for
another, ifit comes.

“The root of the problem,"
says Premier Golda Meir, “is that
our Arab neighbors have not
reconciled themselves to our
existence." Noting the latest
threats of war from Egypt‘s Pre-
sident Anwar Sadat, Israeli
Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. David
Elazar adds, “many Arabs still
think the only solution is to
destroy Israel."

For the Arabs, destroying Is-
rael would be an awesome task.
Willi only smuggled guns and an
improvised army 3,000 regu-
lars, l4,000 uridertrained re-
cruits, four cannons, no tanks
the Israelis beat the armed forces
of seven Arab nations in I948.
That was when the Jewish state
was born and the Arabs tried to
wipe ll otit.

In 1950, wrili an organized btii
untested force, Israel rotrted

Israel At 25: An Evaluation ~

Egypt. And in six days in 1967,
the Israelis eviscerated the
armies of Jordan and Soviet-
supplied Egypt and Syria.

Today the Israeli Defense
Forces are vastly stronger than
in 1967, and Arab strength is
questionable. Moscow still arms
the Arabs, but the Russian ad-
visers have gone home from
Egypt and Israeli reports say
Egyptian defenses are a sham-
bles. King Hussein of Jordan
wants peace, and the Syrian mili-
tary in the past has proved less
than effective.

Israeli Finance Minister Pinhas
Sapir disclosed in April that Is-
rael has spent $6 billion building
its defenses since the 1967 war,
and plans to spend $10 billion
more in the next six years.
Thirty per cent of this year‘s
$4.7 billion budget is for de-
fense.

With its American-built Phan-
tom Jets, Israeli-made missiles
and supertrained pilots, the Is-
raeli air force rules the Mideast
skies. Foreign reports say an
Israeli-built jet is almost ready
for production. For the ground,
Israeli engineers have modiﬁed
and improved the army's Ameri-
can and British tanks, and de-
signed an Israeli “Galil” assault
riﬂe that its designer claim outv
shoots anything in its class. The
Israeli navy has started to pro-
duce its own advanced gunboats.
The Arabs appear to have none
of this self-sufﬁciency, and little
skill with sophisticated weapon-
ry.

But as Israel turns 25 it is not
fighting but seeking peace and a
permanent, secure existence

among its Arab neighbors.

Mrs. Meir and her government
insist that negotiations are the
only way to peace. The Arabs
insist that before a start can be
made Israel must withdraw from
everyiridi?-'of the 26,000 square
miles of Arab land taken in the
I967 war.

Israel has never made it clear
exactly where it wants its new
borders, but it is no longer wait-
ing for Arab agreement on a
map. Informally, it is taking over
the land it wants with concrete
and asphalt instead of the ink
and seals of a political contract.

Israel lives in peace with its
own 366,000 Arab citizens—the
families of those who stayed
instead of ﬂeeing their homes in
the I948 war. But the only
other signs of Arab-Jewish co-
existence to appear in 25 years
have been in the captured zones,
where about one million Arabs
lived under Israeli occupation
since I967.

More than 40,000 of them
now commute to Israel to work
on Israeli pay scales. Almost all
the apartment buildings spring-
ing up in Israel, and the new
hotels appearing in Tel Aviv, are
built by Arab labor.

The fact that 40,000 Arabs are
helping build the Jewish state
raises the troubling question of
who will replace them as
laborers if they return to Jor-
danian rule, and how would ls-
rael handle the west bank popu-
lation if it stays attached to
Israel?

The dilemma is philosophical
as well as practical. Morally,
most lsraelis do not wish to rule
as masters over an alien popula-
tion. Many feel the Israeli creed
of Jewish labor is weakend by
relying on Arab workmen, and
Mrs, Meir admits “what worries
me is that we are getting used to
if so fast,"

0n the practical side, some
lsraeli leaders warn lltal if the
occupied territories became part
of Israel, Arabs would be 45 per
cent of the population bv I980.

The plight of the Palestinians
outside Israel is the most
troubling problem in the Middle
liast, and the Aral) refugees are
the fuel that keeps the fires of
crisis burning.

IN THE NATION

A virtually unpublicized nu-
clear experiment, to be con-
ducted by the Atomic Energy
Commission, is scheduled for a
Rocky Mountain area in north-
west Colorado this spring.

The code-name of the con-
troversial project is “Rio
Blanco." And the experiment
will involve the explosion of
three 30-kiloton nuclear
devices» all at the same time" at
the bottom of a 6000-foot
hole. “Rio Blanco" is an attempt
by the A.E.C. to hollow out an
enormous underground chimney
which will presumany ﬁll up
with billions of cubic feet of
natural gas.

“Rio Blanco" was given the
go-ahead by the Environmental
Protection Agency only after the
agency was reportedly pressured
into doing so by the White
House. If this initial experiment
is successful in creating natual
gas supplies, then A.E.C. propo-
sals call for the exploding of
between 12 and 30 nuclear
bombs underground by I975.
And if that experiment works,
phase three of “Rio Blanco"
suggests -- believe it or not -- that
between 200 and 300 bombs
would be exploded together,
probably late in this decade.

Environmentalists, as might be
expected, are lining up to op-
pose the Rio Blanco tests. The
A.E.C. concedes that large quan-
tities of radio-activity will leak
into the atmosphere, even in its
small initial tests. In addition.
the agency confirms that all of
the natural gas produced will be
made permanently radio-active
by the blast procedure, but the
agency insists that these radio-
active levels will be low. Some of
the natural gas to be produced at
first is expected to be so radio-
active that the A.E.C, is already
making plans to sell it at dirt:
cheap rates. ZNS

crimes have been enacted in Flo-
rida, Montana, Nebraska, Geor-
gia, Connecticut, Nevada, Arkan-
sas, Wyoming, Ohio and Utah.
Arkansas and Tennessee legisla‘
tors also have passed capital
punishment bills that are await-
ing governors’ signatures.

The Supreme Court ruled last
July, in cases involving Texas
and Georgia, that the death pen-
alty as imposed in most states
was unconstitutional.

Most of the new. laws and the
pending measures list speciﬁc
crimes for which the death pen-
alty may be imposed—usually
the killing of a policeman or
ﬁreman and various other types
of murder.

The most recent restoration of
the death penalty came in Con-
necticut and Nevada where
action was completed last week.
In both states, the conditions
leading to imposition of the
death penalty include the mur-
der ofa policeman or ﬁreman on
duty, murder for pay and inur-
der cornmilted by prison in-
mates scrving life sentences.

Arguments over just when the
death penalty should be ini-
posed—if at all—have stalled
capital punishment bills in seve
ral states.

In Pennsylvania, for example,
the House Law arid Justice Corri-
mitiee combined six measures
into one bill that would have
mandated death for persons fur-
nishing drugs that cause a user's
death, for hired assassins, for
anyone convicted of a felony
that results in death, for killers
of on-duty policemen or ﬁrci‘ren
and for those who murdered a
hostage or committed a killing
during a hijacking.

After two days of treated dc-
bate, the measure went back to
committee for further work.
Opponents claimed that the bill
had too many inconsistencies.

The Mississippi legislature
passed a bill that would have
made the death penalty manda-
tory for a convict committing a
murder and for persons con-
victed of prettiedilaled murder,
aircraft piracy, treason and rape
ofa child under I2.

Gov. Bill Waller vetoed the
bill, saying that, although he
favored restoration of capital
punishment, the measure

enacted was unclear. Al’
