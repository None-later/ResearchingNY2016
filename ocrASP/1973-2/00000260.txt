WASHINGTON

Ousted White: House counsel
John W. Dean III will be sub-
poenated and required to testify
before the Senate Watergate-
committee on his reported claim
that he can link President Nixon
to the scandal’s coverup.

Dean will be granted immunity
to gain his testimony if he in-
vokes his right against self-
incrimination.

Sen. Sam J. Ervin, DN.C., the
committee chairman, said Tues-
day he will not decide whether
to call the President to testify
“until some reason to call the
President is known to exist." He
added: “So far I have no infor-
mation the President was person-
ally involved."

White House press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler was asked
Tuesday whether a broad White
House denial of presidential in-
volvement in Watergate was in-
tended to include a denial of
awareness of any covcrup.

The statement. issued Monday
with Nixon‘s concurrence. had
said “any suggestions that the
President participated in any
coverup activity or activities is
untrue.“

Ziegler said he could not go
beyond the statement. but
added the language "was itot
chosen to draw a distinction
between participation and
awareness."

The Watergate story continued
to develop on (‘apitol Hill, in the
Justice Department. It] the Pen-
tagon papers trial in Los
Angclcs. the State Departmeitl
and in the federal courthouse in
Washington.

Ziegler said Nixon was de—
voting very little tinie to the
various investigations btit he is
"spending a good deal of time"
on restructuring his White House
stall. shattered at the top by
resignations.

Asked about a report that the
President once had wondered
aloud whether he should resign,
the press secretary said: “I have
never heard him wonder that out

loud."

Ilie seven-member Senate

Under testimonial immunity, a
witness cannot be prosecuted for
what he admits. But it does nor
prevent prosecution on evidence
gathered independently of his
committee voted Tuesday to
grant testimonial immunity to
Dean and at least five others
should they invoke their consti-
tutional rights against self-
incrimination.

'Ihehearings are scheduled to
begin May 17. The committee
voted to subpoena Dean, fired
April 30 as Nixon‘s official law-
yer.

it was learned the Justice De-
partment was asked Monday to
waive a rule requiring 10 days
notice by the committee that it
intends to ask immunity grants.
The department was given six
requests for waivers.
testimony. A tederal judge issues
the order compelling a witness
to testify after application by
the Justice Department.

Sources close to the committee
said the Icadoff witnesses will be
Bernard L. Barker, Eugenio R.
Martinez, Frank A. Sturgis, and
Virgilio R. Gonzalez, four men
from Miami who were arrested
with James W. McCord Jr. inside
the Watergate offices of the
Democratic party. The four will
be interviewed by the committee
staff Wednesday.

Also on the tentative witness
lists are E. Howard Hunt and G.
(Iordon Liddy. The Miami men
arid llunt pleaded guilty at the
start of the Watergate trial to
conspiracy. burglary and wire-
tapping McLord and Liddy were
convicted of the same charges
after trial. Hunt already has been
granted imrnunily by ('liiei‘ US.
District Judge John L. Sirica.

“We‘re goiitg to do our thing in
a cairn, orderly. and objective
way." said Sen. lloward liakci,

member of the committee. Tilt)

Hunt Forges '
JFK Cables

LOS ANGELES

Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt hastestifted that
special presidential counsel
Charles W. Colson directed him
to forge cablegrams linking Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy to the
killing of South Vietnamese Pre-
sident Ngo Dinli Diem.

Hunt, in a Watergate grand
jury testirnotiy released here
Monday by the Pentagon papers
trial judge, said he had found
enough in State Department ﬁles
to hint at Kennedy involvement
in the i963 assassination. But he
said Colson declared that wasn’t
“good enough" and ordered the
forgeries.

in Washington, (‘olson denied
the charge.

US. District Court Judge Matt
Byrne released the testimony as
part of the mounting evidence of
government involvement in the
Pentagon papers case and the
prosecution of codefendant
Daniel Ellsberg.

Hunt sais he was working on a
White House probe oftlie Penta—
gon papers leak in W71 when he
spotted documents that might
be used to embarass the late Pre-
sident Kennedy's family. He said
some documents also appeared
to be iitissirig. atid he figured
tltose would be the most dama-
ging.

llttttt said he relayed this infor-
mation to ('olson. and Hunt
quoted ('olsoti as saying, "Well,
what kind of tiiatcrial have you
dug up till the tiles that would
indicate Kennedy complicity?“

"lnferentially. one could say
that it was a high degree of
administration complicity in the
actual assassination of Diem and
his brother."

He recalled that Colson said,
“Well. this isn't good enough.
Do you think you could improve
on them?"

“I said. ‘ch, l probably could,
but not without technical assis-
tance,’ Hunt testified, noting
that as a former CIA agent he
had been given training in
“Floating forged newspaper ac-
counts, telegrams. that sort of
thing...
