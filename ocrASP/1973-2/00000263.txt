by Bill Brina

Some musicians add more to a
performance or a recording than
sheer technical skill; call it what
you will--verve, drive, charisma,
funk: some have it. and some
don’t. Eric Clapton, for all his
technical skill, does not. Jerry
Garcia does, and his presence on
Merl Saunder‘s Fire Up (Fantasy
9421) makes an already good
album even better. Merl is a
master of that style of keyboard
playing best described as
“mellow funk.“ It’s sweet, :1 bit
gritty, proficient without being
ostentatious, and goes down just
ﬁne behind some equally funky
Garcia guitar work and singing.

 
 

 

Jerry's playing here doesn't bear
much resemblance to the style
he employs on his own songs;
it’s closer to the r-and-b styled
playing he‘d use on Pigpen's
material.

With expertly styled backing
by bassist John Kahn, drummer
Bill Vitt, and rhythm guitarist
Tom Fogcrty, Merl and Jerry
(with hpr from various other
assorted musicians) tackle mater-
iiil that ranges from J.J. Cale's
After Midnight, which is render»
ed in ii miinncr more reminiscent.
of JJ than Eric's version was to
the soul-smooth Charisma. The
album concludes with a nine-
minute scorcher from ii live

KSAN broadcast, Lonely Aven-
ue. The fidelity on this one
number isn't the greatest but the
playing really does a slow bum.

A good deal bouncier but just
as funky is the debut album of
Bad Buscomb. appropriately
titled Black Grass (Paramount.
PAS 6048). The record compny
didn't supply any background
information and the album itself
doesn’t either, and so I don't
know who these people are.
Whoever they are, they're good.
Bab Bascomb appears to be a
mainly black soul—bluegrass
band. The singer (Bascomb him-
self, 1 think) assays a variety of
soul styles, but what he‘s best at

As 1 listen to “Around the

wistfully recall the raw begin-
nings of this revolutionary step
towards a multi-media year-

It was a blustery Thursday in
January when the courier sum-
moned me to the office of John
Chow. Upon my arrival, l was
ushered into the "inner chum
her” by a 6'7" mute entirely
bald save for the long braid
down his back. The "chamber"
was a myriad of tapestries and
incese. A man-servant appeared
and, with a forceful blow struck
a huge gong. Before the deaf-

ening rcverbariitions ceased,
Chow entered with his inter
preter Jiiy Rosenberg. Both
looked extremely unhappy. l

after it week of hard-pressed

4,000 recordings.

sists of a standard soul rhythm
section, occuional bran. and
bluegrass-picking banjo and
ﬁddle. This odd mixture works
best on the title cunt. and on the
nine-minute hoedown/soul-

stomp Bo Diddley. The juxta-‘

position of the street- comer
jive, a driving Slyderived electric
bass, Buscomb’s frantic pleading,
and the bouncy, bluegrass-bright
playing of the banjo and the
ﬁddle produca a result I'll
guarantee you’ve never heard
before. There are a few mistakes
and some empty space on this
album, but the concept issound
and these people should go far.
Are you ready for black grass??

Bad Bascomb isn’t. the only
one trying to create this new
hybrid. Working from the other
direction, white country singer
Joe Stampley is doing the same
thing. Soul Song (0326007) Dot
Records, who cases Stampley
with material that ranges from
pure Nashville countrypolitan,
which I assume most readers of
this will dislike (so do 1; ya gotta
be a member of the “Silent
Majority" to get off on that
junk) to pleasant, rhythm and
bluesy material. [Tearing a

country artist attack Mind-b is in
itself a novelty. but Stampley
does it. well, particularly on the
title song and on You Make Life
Easy. But the killer of the album
is his all—out version of I Can'l
Help Myself, one of the best soul
singles of 7 or so years ago.
Stampley really gets down with
it, shedding his polish and sacri-
ficing all other values to ur-
gency. Kudos also to the uniden-
tiﬁed pedal steel guitar player on
this cut; he manages to impart a
generous wallop fo soul with an
instrument that is hardly, if ever.
identiﬁed with the genre.

A few artists alone do not
make a trend, but 1 would not
be at. all surprised to see more
attempts to mix the two musics
that have been strongly iden-
tiﬁed with separate races: soul
and bluegrass/country. Both
forms have a good deal more in
common than is generally real-
ized; some rock bands (the
Dead, the Flying Burritos near
their end) have played with
using elements of both styles
together; and now genre perfor-
mers themselves seem ready to
take the plunge. Both musically
and socially, this promises to be
one of the better developments
in some time.
