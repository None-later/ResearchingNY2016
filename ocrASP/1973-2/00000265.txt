Hunsberger Expected To Address Faculty Today

by Gary Ricciardi
l. Moyer Hunsberger is slated to
speak before an assembly of the

' College of Arts and Sciences 2:00

this afternoon in LC 1. His
scheduled appearance will be his
first public one since this week’s
confrontations between students,
faculty and administrators be an
over the question of his possi 1e
suspension and related issues.

The scheduled meeting of the
College of Arts and Sciences is

ordinarily a routine affair, but the
controversy surrounding Dean
Hunsberger adds to this assembly
the tension which has characterized
administrative and student relations
this past week.

Last night Dean Hunsberger an-
nounced in a written statement that
he has accepted the post of Provost
at the University of Oklahoma’s
Norman Campus. It is expected
that he will personally announce his
resignation to the assembled faculty

at this afternoon’s meeting.

The Steering Committee of the
loosely organized students who
have held sit-ins in President
Benezet’s office and public rallies
througout the week, is encouraging
students to attend today’s meeting.

The Committee is urging students,
however, not to interrupt what is,
in formal terms, a faculty assembly.

According to Chris Masterson, a

by Al Senia

I. Moyer llurrsberger has resigned.

The Arts & Sciences Dean. a contro-
versial ﬁgure in numerous tenure cases at
he trniversity this year said in a written
ttaterncnt last rrigltt that he will accept a
provost position at the University of
Oklahoma.

“1 have been offered and I have ac-
cepted the position as Provost of the
University of Oklahoma at Norman," the
statement said in part.

As Provost, llunsberger will be second
only to Oklahoma President Paul Sharp in
deciding internal acaderrric affairs at the
university. lack ('orcoran. Director of
(‘orrrrrrtitricatiott at the Oklahoma carri-
pus, said [It a telephone intervtew
yesterday that lltrnsbcrgcr Will he iii
charge ol "preparing the total academic
program and budget for the university."
Hunsbergerdre added. Will be “in charge ol
all faculty appointments, promotion and
tenure issues." Ilis salary Will be $3X,000
a year.

In his statement last night. Hurrsberger
said he made the move “with mixed
ciriotroris" because "l have truly enjoyed
irry Work here arid ant leavmg because this
new appointment appears so promising."

“I have appreciated the opportunity to
work with faculty. students arid admiri-
istrators at Albany," llunsberger's state-
rrietit continued, “and particularly the
support extended to me frortr rrrarry sides,
even when the circurirstanccs trray have
been difficult."

University President Louis 1'. Benelet
was quick to offet congratulations to the
departing dean. liencLet, in his public
statement, said the appointment “is a
tectrrtgiriton of his stature as an ed-
ucational leader."

llurisberger. liericlel added, tirade "a
significant contribution" to the university
through his deanship.

Both Hunsberger and Benelet were uti-
available for additional corrrrrretrt. An
unidentified spokesman at the Hurts-
beiger residence said the Dean was at-

member of the Steering Committee.
“Several faculty members are
drawing up proposals concerning
Dean Hunsberger’s review and that
of the tenure and continuing ap-
pointment system. I hope that stu-
dents will be there to support these
proposals. But I think the faculty
should be allowed to dominate the
meeting. This is their issue as well
as the students’. I hope students do
not try to take over the meeting,
but help faculty at their request."

H UN SBERGER OUT

The controversial Dean announced last night
he will take a position at the U. of Oklahoma

lending a dinner in Massachusetts. There
was no comment from the Benezet res-
idcnce.

lltinsberger’s announcement confirmed
rumors of his imminent departure that
had circulated around the univeristy
throughout the day.

The search committee that selected
llunsberger to be l’rovost at the Okia-
Ironra campus had been looking for avail-
able candidates since last fall. Cor‘coran
said. Hunsberger was one of three names
sent along to the university president
“within the last week."

l’resident Sharp, (‘or'coran added, se-
lcclcdl‘lunsberger on the basis of the
committee’s recommendations “as well as
personal interviews."

('orcorarr revealed that Hunsberger had
travelled to the Oklahoma campus last
week to rrreet with the president and
discuss contract terms.

Reading front a press release issued by
the Board of Regents yesterday, ('otcoran
quoted the Oklahoma president as saying
“I am delighted Dr. Ilunsbergcr has
agreed to serve as Provost." The position
was characterized by the president as
being “one of the most significant at the
university,"

lit the release. l'lllllSthgL‘l was quoted
as saying: “l look forward to rriy new
duties as provost."

('orcoran also revealed that the search
committee and the university president at
Oklahoma both knew of Hunsberger’s
past problems at the University of Mass-
achusetts and SUNY-Albany. But he iridi-
cated that knowledge did not seriously
lessen Hunsberger's chances of employ-
ment at the urriversily.

The search committee was described as
a "faculty committee." But asciicond
university spokesman said three students
served on it and that all elements of the
university corttrnuttity were included.

llunsberger will assume his new duties
on August lst. It is expected that a
search committee here will name his
replacement as Dean of the College ot
Arts &. Sciences sometime over the
summer.
