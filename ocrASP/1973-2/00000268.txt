Crime Rise on Campus Means
More Guns for SUNY Police

by Glenn von Nostitz
Campus security is chang-
ing. The old “campus rent~a~
cop" image of the retired.
benevolent men who giveout
parking tickets by day and
lock up buildings at night is
being gradually replaced
with a new image. in which
the professional. alert and
stable characteristics of the
campus police forces is
stressed. it is all part of a
state-wide program of
professionalization. aimed
at ccmbatting a crime surge
which has reached major
proportions on some SUNY
campuses.
l’rofessionalization has
meant that on many cam-
puses security units are now
hardly distinguishable from
regular community police.
and in some instances the
name has been changed from
“campus security" to "cam-
pus police" to reflect this.

that campus security l’orccs

handguns. Undergmdelines

guns on campus are
anathema. and raise the

students voted over ten to
one against the use of
handguns by security of-
ficers and eight to one
against the use of mace.

Nevertheless guns have
reportedly been purchased at

the way in at SUNY Buffalo.

Housing

The overcrowding in the

been reduced from the crisis

altogether. The atudents

students remain in triples.

This is the first year since

been overcrowded. At the

This year. the dorms opened
at about 105% capacity.

The figure 105%may not
look too high on paper. but it
means that students were
stuck everywhere from
lounges on lndian to
apartments on Dutch and
guest rooms.

Despite the overcrowding.
the university had as smooth

according to Charles Fisher.
who was Director of
Residences until September
1, The Acting Director. .lerry
l’etre. says that while there
were objections from
parents. and even some coin-
plaints from students' State
asseniblyinen. such coin-
plaiiits come in every year.

Mr. l’etre and Me. Fisher
both believe that the housing
criSis stems from the fact
that both the freshman class
and the munber of new
transfer students are larger
than the official projections.

Mr. Fisher contends that the
university aimed to admit
3000 new students. and
overshot this goal by about
400. The proportion of con-
tinuing students who chose
to live in university dorms id
not change from last year.

Mr. Rodney Hart. Director
of Admissions. agrees that
the number of fresh men and
transfers is high, However.
he suggests that the housing
problem might have been
created in other ways. He
notes that more freshmen
proportionally come from
outside the albany area this
year. and thatmany students
who live within commuting
distance have elected to live
in the dorms. contrary to ex-
pectations.

There is no doubt that a
conscious effort was made to
recruit a large number of
students and to fill up the

Our campus security men may be operating under
the delusion that they are'peace officers" empowered
to make arrests and carry handguns.

That was the startling conclusion drawn from an iii-
vestigation headed by Student Assocmtion l’reSident
Steve Gerber this week. At a press conference held
yesterday aftemoon. Gerber stated that SUNY Cen-
tral is working under the mistaken belief that security
men are technically “peace officers."

According to Gerber. "peace officers" are required
to undergo an intensive eight week training session
sponsored by the Munic1pal Police Training CounCil.
and that of the eleven "peace officers" empowered to
carry guns at SUNYA. some may have taken only a
four week course. and are not legally entitled to exer-
CJse the full privileges of a "peace officer." Those
priVileges include carrying guns and making arrests.
