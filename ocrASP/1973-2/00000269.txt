At about 7:45 Wednesday
night. Chairperson Eric
Lonschein‘s gavel struck the
table. signaling the begin-
ning of a new season for Cen-
tral Council.

Council did not waste any
time in getting down to
serious business. After tak-
ing care of a few procedural
matters. the agenda was
suspended to discuss the
issue of campus security of-
ficers carrying guns.

Student Association Presi-
dent Steve Gerber informed
the Council that a number of
campus security officers
have been bearing arms
while on duty. Both‘ Gerber
and Vice President Barry
Davis have been devoting a
great deal of time and energy
of late to the investigation of
ways to end this. Working
closely with the SA. ex-
ecutives has been Sandy
Hosenblum. the SA. lawyer.
who was present at the
Wednesday night meeting.
Rosenblum indicated that
the gun carrying practice
raised both legal and. as he
termed ~it. "ecological"
questions.

Arriving at the meeting
shortly thereafter was the

 § Gunlssue lends Coimcil

other invited guest. Director

.of Security James R.

Williams. Appearing relax-
ed and puffing on a long
black pipe. Williams non-
chalantly accepted
questions from student
leaders and Rosenblum for
almost two hours.
Williams informed the
Council that there has been a
series of incidents duringthe
past few years involving
armed crimes on campus.
Suprisingly enough.
however. Williams opined. "I
don't think carrying
firearms will prevent a
single crime on campus."
This opinion seemingly
runs counter to the justifica-
tion offered by the Office of
Community Relations.
which is the Admi8nistra-
tion spokesman for this
policy. A news release
issued by this office calls the
problem of violent criminal
acts on campus "large
enough to warrant carrying
firearms as a deterrant to the
potential criminal and to
protect members of the cam-
pus community as well as
police force members in-
volved in any action." This
fact plus William's ex-
Dressed doubts about the

deterrence value of the
weapons led to Rosenblum's
basic question: “Why the
guns?“

While admitting he did not
feel that the guns for security
officers is ii. necessity.
Williams did reason that of-
ficers would be less hesitant
to approach dangerous
situations if they had a gun.
He claimed he knew of two
instances in which this in
fact was the case.

The discussion moved to
the question of who
specifically was carrying a
gun. and of the eleven securi-
ty officers now armed. the
legal authority of the five
was seriously challenged.
Williams apparently felt that
all eleven were. in one way or
another. authorized to carry
guns. but many student
leaders. especially Gerber
and Davis remained uncon-
vinced.

Later on in the evening. the
Council passed a bill ill-
troduced by Steve Gerber.
urging the University Senate
“to petition President
Benezet to suspend the use of
loaded firearms by security"
except under a few specific
circumstances.

Arab states expropriate U.S.-0wned

PROPERTY: The Internal Revcnuc Si-i

What Goodman will do next
appears uncertain. He has the
right to appeal the tenure deci-
sion. and that now seems likely.
One thing is for sure: Goodman
will not give up without it strong
fight. The university has not
heard the last from him.
