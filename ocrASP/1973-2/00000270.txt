The Albany State book
;: store's long-standing
' reputation for being a peren-
nial money loser as well as a.
place of inconvenience and
long book lines may soon be
a thing of the past.

That should be the case if
Gary Dean has his way. For'
Dean. who is the new
manager of the book store. is
determined to make a. go of
(what has generally been an
unprofitable operation. In
fact. the University . who has
leased the store to the Follett
Company. a Chicago based
firm. is trying a whole new
approach to the book
business this year.

The new manager spoke
about the changes taking
place in the book store. Ap-
parently Albany's long book
.lines had garnered quite a
reputation for themselves.
because. according to Dean:
, “When i came to Albany in
June. the major problem fac-
ing me was to find a way to
get the lines down. My ex-
perience in this business has
shovt = me that the self ser-
vice wncept is the one that

 

Bookstore Service Works

works best.“

In order to install the self
service system. the Follett
Company had a number of
walls taken down. Thus. a
roomier L-shaped store was
created.

According to Dean. the self
service concept has been a
success so far. He estimates
the average time spent by
shoppers to be between 25-30
minutes as compared to the
longer waits under the old
tunntl system.

Dean also talked about
some other areas connected
with the book store. When
asked if he actually expected
to make a profitthe first
year. he admitted that it was
too early to analyze sales
against such factors as
returns. shoplifting. and ex-
pense.

in regard to what the
bookstore was going to carry
in the way of goods. the
manager noted that "our
primary function is books."
He added. though. that the
store will try to keep a supp-
ly of items which are called
for most. Food will not be

'baryDenn.Boohtouw
one such item. however. “By
contract we were asked to
eliminate the food." '

Finally Dean wish-
ed to thank students for their
cooperation during this
“period of acclimation." ‘ho
thought that of of‘the biggest
problems would be getting
students used to the new
system. But so far he has
found the transition in-
credibly smooth. That. at
least. will be one less

problem for Gary Dean to '

cope with in what promises
to be a very demanding job.

Students can stay in triples

predicts that most students
will indeed choose to remain
in their triples. Those

they still are charged a lower

Not all students were un-
happy in their temporary
housing. UntilTuesday.four
girls. Darlene Hill. Lily
Munoz. Pamela Profit. and
Regina Wilson werelivingin
a large bunk-type room in
Sayles. Originally eight
girls had lived there. butfour
were quickly moved into
regular housing. The room
contained four bunk beds and
little else. The dressers were
in the closets. The only visi-
ble furniture was a folding
chair. Yet there were

the four said. “i cried wlion i

Campus police departments
on the larger campuses have

'been increasingly plagued

by armed robberies. and now.
drug related crimes. But the
situation at the smaller two
and four years schools. es-
pecially in the more rural
area. it is quite different. Ar—
ming of security police is
staunchly opposed by the
directors of several
small departments. some of
whom are retired police of-
ficers who want nothing
more than to enjoy a
somewhat leisurely retire-
ment.

it does not appear likely
that the SUNY Binghamton
force will begin using
handguns simply because
the crime rate there does not
warrant their introduction.
the campus is in a suburban
area in the State's southern
tier. a location which has
traditionally had little major
crime. The security force
there doesn't even use night
sticks.

Most categories of crime at
Binghamton have decreased
with the exception of drug-
related robberies. and that is
the one problem area facing
the security director there.
However. there have been no
requests from members of
the security force for
handguns to deal with the
situation.

The guidelines for
handgun use were rigorous-
ly formulated by SUNY Cen—

tral Administration. land in
the eyes of some security
chiefs- too rigorously tor-

. mulated. Part of the problem,

one director said privately, .
is that SUNY Central Ad-
ministration's security\
policies are statewide in
their application and leave
little room for ﬂexibility.
“There should be some sort
of accomodattons for local I
needs" echoes another direc-
tor.

Several campus security
chiefs have expressed the
fear that without handguns
their forces will eventually
turn into “mere watchmen"
and that llocal police will
have to be called in to deal

with serious crimes.

But how readily members
of the campus communities
across the state will accept
handguns is uncertain.
What is certain is that on
most SUNY campuses crime
rates are rising and that
many of the crimes -
particularly drug related
ones- are violent. This situa-
tion may prompt some
students into aaccepting
handguns in the hands of
their campus security of-
ficers.

On the other hand. many
students remain skeptical
even in the face of all the
assurances. Many still feel
that the guns are not
necessary and that their ex-
istence on campus is an in-
vitation to their usoand

possible misuse.
