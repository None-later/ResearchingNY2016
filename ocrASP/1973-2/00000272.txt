Suggestion to SPAC

by Kevin Daniels

Again this year as the
summer comes to an end.
Saratoga Performing Arts
officials are considering the
future of the special event at
the complex with final deci-
sion on next year supposedly
to come soon. But S.P.A.C. of-
ficials announcements are.
as always in the past. con-
fusing. Even though the
attendance to a record 80.000
(Benny Goodman dre’w 9.000
himself) people. it is ex-
tremely well known that the
special events. such as the
Allman Borthers. BB. King.
and Weather Report. The
Temptations, Pink Floyd and
last week's Santana<
Mahavishnu fusion aare
what is responsible for keep-
ing the whole S.P.A.C.
season from being a tremen-
dous financial failure. But
due to local pressures by
SPAC area residents. poor
security precautions. and the

selling of too many lawn
tickets the concerts may
have to find a new way into
the area. Is it not strange that
the arts center‘s
businessmen could allow the
ballet and orchestra. a poor
financial risk. to continue at
a loss and then make the an-
nouncements that they have
about the special events
future.

A perfect example of the
total blame being mostly on
the performing arts people is
the Allman Brothers concert

‘ of this last summer. A crowd

totalling about 28.000 was in
attendance and soon before
the Brothers were to come on
stage the usual mob ofpeople
from the lawn. wanting to
fight the price scale and be
able to see the act. were
allowed to stampede their
way down the aisles pushing
and shoving their way past
the customers seated in

front. True things may not
have been so bad if these
people were not so intent
upon standing up during the
concert, or did not literally
push seated patrons out of
their seats who were now
forced to stand on their seats
min order to see. but security
(middle aged ushers) were
not adequate in handling the
mass hysteria and in result
the fire marshall was forced
not to allow the concert to
start until these people movl
ed back. The road manager or
the Brothers had the chore of
literally begging the crowd
to move back a little. to no
availand theBrothers stayed
in the dressing room wan
ting to play. After no Success
and thousands of dollars be-
ing at stake for SPAC and the
Brothers. everybody con-
cerned crossed fingers and
prayed no one would get
hurt. After their first set an
intermission followed and
again the fans (fanatics‘.’i
were begged to step back a bit

produced The Great Dic-
tator as an indictment of
the tyrannies of that
Bangerous and rather
ridiculous world leader.
In later years. Chaplin
stated that TheGreat Dic-
tator would not have been
made had he known the

representative off the set.
The GreatDictator prov-
ed to be one of Chaplin's
most popular features.
Chaplin’s rantings as
Adenoid Hynkel brought
the newsreels and radio
speeches of Hitler into
their true perspective.
