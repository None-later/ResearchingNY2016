The one lesson we learn from
history is that we learn no lessons
from history and. with the so-
called “Watergate Committee"
now in recess. probably the only
conclusion we can safely come to
after the many long months of in-
tensive testimony is that we can
come to no conclusions safely. It‘s
still too early to pin down any
specific charges of wrongdoing on
any of Mr. Nixon's top aides or
former aides. much less Mr. Nixon
himself. yet. not too surprisingly
there are those among us who.
despite all the present confusion
over the facts. are sure of one
thing: Mr. Nixon should be im-
peached.

No doubt the call for impeach-
ment at this early date stems more
from a deep personal resentment
on the part of his critics over Mr.
Nixon‘s policies than a genuine
concern for our government's
political survival. Those who
want now to impeach Mr. Nixon
wanted in'72 and ‘68 to defeat him
at the polls and. failing that. tried
throughout his term to destroy his
effectiveness. The current tirade.
then. is but another chapter in the
long war between Itichard Nixon
and his enemies Those who de-
mand his removal by impeach-
ment seek only his removal. How
it is done is. to many of his critics
and enemies. secondary.

But to call now for the
President's impeachment is both
foolish and dangerous for im-
peachment carries with it certain
inherent. dangers that the im-
peachment lobby seems un-
concerned about. No American
President has ever been impeach-

ed with the exception of Andrew
Johnson and historians now

Impeachment (and

why we shouldn ’t)

generally agree that even his was-
the result more of unfair personal
antagonism than anything else.

This should indicate. from an
historical perspective at least.that
impeachment holds a perilous and
at most a precarious place in our
system of checks and balances,
And this is as it should be for no
other constitutionally-sanctioned
political event takes us down so
uncertain Lind disasteru
ridden a road as
does the impeachment of a Presi-
dent. It islikeenteringamaze. We
can only enter the process blindly
and with no precedents and few
signs to guide us we rely as much
on prayer and luck as on the
tcchnician's skill to see us
through. Impeachment is
probably the most revolutionary
and therefore the most unwieldy
and least workable solution
provided by our Constitution. It is
the swashbuckling dare-devil‘s
approach to politics and this is
why it has been utilized only once.
more than a century ago.

Yetatthe same timeitis precise-
ly its revolutionary
characteristics that give it, for
some at least. its appeal. It whets
our appetite for the flambuoyant
and the bizarre. Our thirst for an
exciting and monumental
historical upset would well be
satisfied if we could. in our
lifetime. impeach a president.
And. heavenknows. Richard Nix-
on has given us many a good ex-
cuse.

But such impassioned
enthusiasms are the breeding
ground of disaster and a sober
reflection on both the costs and
benefits of such a move should
cause even the most outraged
among us to hesitate before taking
us blindly into that jungle.

Increased freshman and transfer-student
enrollment this semester means many new
faces on the Albany campus; faces un-
familiar with the atmosphere and crises of

our community and indeed. a. problem in
themselves.

The overcrowding on this campus in
somethingthat is hard to ignore. especially if
you are one of those fortunate students
assigned “emergency housing" in a lounge.
or a freshman in a tripled-up room barer
adequate for two. The first week of school
saw dinner lines extending through
flagrooms, long waits at this office and that.
people crammed in sweltering classrooms.
These hassles are by no mean unique to this
time and place. but do necessitate immediate
concern and evaluation.

The problem of overcrowding
extends way beyond the physical discom-
forts of classroom and dorm. The whole issue
of quality education is at stake. On a campus
suitable for 10,000. we are pushing 15.0(io
How long is this to go on? Till we hit 20.001).
25,000? Where and when will the line bc
drawn?Shou1dn‘t it have been drawn long
ago?

What it boils down to is a question ol
priorities. Money must be‘ made. yes. and
contracts must be fulfilled. but what does
this institution exist for? The concern for
quality education and the maintenance of an
atmosphere conducive to it seem all-but
forgotten in attempts to make ends meet and
mass-produce college graduates.

While we recognize the attempts being
made by University personnel to deal with
the immediate overcrowding crisis con fron-
ting us. we express extreme concern over th
perennial trend to tax our resources to the
limit and beyond. at the expense of our very
reason for being here. '

Manhattan Revisited

by Roxanne Reisch

Job hunting in Manhattan this
summer proved to be a com-
petitive race for thousands of
students seeking too few available
jobs. Already in May. employ-
ment agencies throughout the
mid-town area were swarmed with
eager college students ready to
grab at any temporary positions
along with the usual f1°°d of
college graduates. One could con-
spicously spot the student. sitting
or standing uncomfortably in his
Sunday best. perhaps on the steps
of Manhattan's 42nd Street
Library with the New York Times,

The truth of the summer job
situation in Manhattan was that
there were hardly enough
specifically designed summer
jobs for the student on vacation.
Those summer jobs (perhaps as a
fill-in secretary for a vacationing
one or a luncheonette runner) ac-
tually advertised as such were im-
mediately filled still leavinga ma-
jority of people out of luck. The
summer job. per se. was truly a
scarcity.

Time Magazine reports in its
August27thissuethattheemployv
ment situation has improved.
"The seasonal rate of unemploy-
ment between the ages of 16 and 19
is now 14.8"; compared with 16% a
year ago; but the statistics do not
tell the difficulties of findingajob.
particularly for students seeking
summer work."

Many students resorting to
deception. lied to employers and
employmentagencies by claiming
that they sought full time employ-
mcnt as opposed to merely
summer work, One lawyer look-
ing to hire a receptionist told me
any girl who says "I’m not going
back to school". "I need money so i
have to work” or "I'm going to
school at night" was almost im-
mediately disqualified because of
the probability of her lying.

Yet. many students did secure

 

jobs in the manner only to quit and
inconvenience their employer
later in the summer. One friend in—
volved in this familiar routine ex-
plained. “I‘m doing the job
anyway so what‘s the difference if
they hire somebody permanently
two months later.“ One can only
speculate about the differing at-
titudes of a worker seriously look—
ing for full time employment and
the student knowing that this is
not his livelihood but rather a two
to three month escapade designed
primarily for making money. Un-
fortunately. students are driven to
this deceit.

While spending days onlined-up
chairs in employment agencies. I
caught a glimpse of forthcoming
struggles to obtain meaningful
work. One employment agent in-
terviewing a girl. pathetically
typical of so many other job
finders I witnessed, first asked.
"How fast can you type?“ Her
speed of 30 words per minute was
adequate to place her into any de-
cent paying job.

Quickly offering the young lady a
job as a trainee in an insurance
firm for $100 a week. angered she
explained. “I want something
related to my field of sociology. I
didn‘t go to college for this."

Rather than experience this
cultural shock away from the con-
fines and bubble-like protection of
the university campus. it is im~
perative to realize the gap between
the businessand academic worlds.

In many businesses office skills
such as typing is worth more
than the college diploma.

For most students. other than
the handful who will survive the
rigors of competition and even
tually emergc as ready made doc<
tors. dentists or lawyers. evaluw
tion of obtainable employman
positions and preparatory steps
towards a particular goal must bt
made if one Wishes to secure
meaningful jobs if any Well pay-

A Word From

Tenure! Those of us who
are returning students will
remember that word from
the end of last semester.
Many of us along with many
concerned faculty members‘
met in the Ballroom and
spent a. night sleeping in the
Administration Quad“ (ad-
ministration building).
Many of our finest teachers
were getting the axe. Un—
less we begin acting now the
situation will continue. Es-
pecially for freshmen and
sophomores we must
reverse the trend. We have to

begin making our views
known now. The major
problem with last

semester's problem action is
that it came too late. I invite
everyone in the University
to a meeting in the Fireside

Running Scared

lloward Phillips is scared and I

at home on page 34. next to an arti-

Harvey is ai'cal American. and he
has more right to be scared than
the rest of us. except for maybe

The President thanked both
Harvey and Phillips for theircon—

assured Harvey that even gloom-

Center.

One of the main problems
at this institution is the way
decisions are made.
Students and/or faculty are
often taken for granted.
Changes are reported to us
and that‘s called consulta-
tion. We are being affected
by two decisions made over
a year ago without the Ad-
ministration going through
channels. One is the
transformation of Mohawk
Tower on Indian Quad into
an office building. The kind
of decision all the people liv-
ing in triple rooms ap-
preciate I’m sure. The other
decision was the decision to
allow Security to use guns
under certain limited con-
ditions. In my next column
I‘ll be discussing these two
decisions.

The gun issue will be dis-
cussed atthe Senate meeting
on Monday. September 10.
3:30 in the Assembly ‘hall.
All members of the Univer-
sity Community are invited,

 

he was "too much a patriot and a
man of integrity to let that

ing. the l’reslugnt excused himself
momentarily to decentralize a

responded to it: determining that

The President again thanked

both Hill'ch and l’liillips fortheir
concern. and made a phonccall to
somebody whom he instructed to
"take ciiizcol'Howard". He assured
llai'vcy that. its llowai'd Phillips
once said. he carcd "too much for
oursystcm of checks and balances
to let the institution of the
Presidency become an empty
ceremonial shell."

Harvey said he hoped so.
because he'd hate to see his cause-
our cause yielded away.’l‘he Presi-
dent excused himself for a mo-
ment. and Harvey looked on in awe
as he reduced the concentration of

Harvey reports that he is

Iloward Phillips. Richard Nixon
is neither a changed man nor a
dead one. Unlessthings gofurther
than even liberal historians have
reason to expect. out President

be making. good boots for many
years to come.
