Attention
Elsewhere

WASHINGTON AP -
President Nixon. who had
been holding news con-
ferences less. may now be
enjoying them more.

After I 14 months
without a televised
question-and-answer ses-
sion. Nixon has held two
in the past two weeks.
With them, the President
appears to have made
substantial headway in
his effort to move past
Watergate and turn atten-
tion to other issues.

There was evidence of
that in the marked con-
trast between the two
news conferences. one
Wednesday, the other at
San Clemente. Calif. on
Aug. 22.

The San Clemente

appearance. Nixon's first
news conference in any
setting since March 15,
was dominated by
Watergate. Eighteen of
the 21 questions were
related to the scandal. and
most of them were harsh-
ly worded.

Indeed. Nixon at one
opoint answered a ques-
tion he had not been ask~
ed. breaking in to express
his irritation at the way
the questions were going.
“Just a minute." he said.
“We have had 30 minutes
of this press conference. I‘
have yet to have  one
question on the business
of the people. which
shows how we are con-
sumed with this.

ltwasdifferent Itwas
different Wednesday. A
half-dozen Watergate

questions were among the
14 put to the President.but
there were no new points
raised. Inflation. oil.
foreign policy. and taxes
were major topics raised
and covered.

In San Clemente. Nixon
faced the questions piled
up during nearly 10 weeks
Senate Watergate
hearings. With the in-
vestigation in recess. and
Congress just returning
form a month off. there
was no such pressure
Wednesday.

Nixon quickly went on
thooffensive.announcing
he would prod the

 

Democreatic-controlled
Congress to act on ad-
ministration proposals
by submitting a new
State of the Union
message,

As in San Clemente.
there was a Nixon jab at
the news media as he dis-
cussed his effort to
rebuild confidence in the
administration.

“It is rather difficult . ..
to have the President of
the United States by in-
nuendo. by leak. by. frank-
ly. leers and sneers of
commentators - which is
their perfect right ~ at-

that. confidence being
worn away." he said

"Now how is it
restored? Well. it's
restored by the President
notallowinghis owncon—
l'idence to be destroyed
...Secondit‘s restored by
doing something."

Nixon said that is what
he is trying to achieve. but
added that the news media
have not paid much atten-
tion. “Your attention is.
quite understandibly. in
the more fascinating area
of Watergate.“ he said.

The President wan ts the
attention
elsewhere. and the in-
dications so far are that
his two news conferences
served that aim.
