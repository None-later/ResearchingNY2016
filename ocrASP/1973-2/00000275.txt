1 Gov. Thomas Salmon
promised the townspeo-
ple of Holland there
would never be another
rock festival in the state
of Vermont .

,The governor made the
trip Wednesday, to in—
spect the site of a festival
which drew 35.000 people
to the Canadian border»
town. The planned three-
day event erupted into
gate-crashing. fights and
a shooting incident. The
rock music was cut short
a full day early‘ when the
promoters . could no
longer pay the bands to

 
 

 

By the time Salmon
reached the hillside where
' throngs had camped. the

area had been partially’

cleaned b y promotor

Ronald “Mac” Worth and

a group of young people

who worked all day‘
Tuesday .
The people of Holland
told the governor they
had suffered no personal
injuries and litle property
damage. but they said the
emotional scars were
deep.
Salmon said he fully
understood their feelings.
because his town of
Rockingham had been
beseiged by “motorcycle
scrambles" several years
before.
"i know what a mob
scene can be like in a rural
community Salmon told
the 125 persons gathered
on the windy hillside
"The only good news is

that the thing has
become so visible and
such bad news . par—
ticularly in terms ofthose
who live here. thatwe will
change our laws and our
regulations in our society
so we we will nothave any
more rock concerts in
Vermont ever."

He said laws would
have to be carefully
written to insure they
were constitutional and
did not hurt those
gatherings which were “a
part of Vermont life.“

The laws to prevent

festivals because they

and a part of the Vermont
tradition. like
agricultural fairs. accor-
ding to Salmon.

Salmon said new state
legislation should be on
the books by January . In
the meantime . he
repeatedly said local of-
ficials had adequate laws
already to deal with rock
festivals or other un-
welcome gatherings .

He mentioned an or-
dinance he had written for
Rockingham which set
forth the guarantees
promoters would be re-
quired to post before em-
barking on large -scale
show of any kind.

A number of the
townspeople were critical
of Aty. Gen. Kimberly
Cheney. who suggested

the town settle for a securi-

ty bond rather than seek-
ing an injunction against
the festival.

Selectmen asid they
tried to seek Cheney‘s aid.
but were told there was
nothing they could do and
to let the festival proceed.

Salmon drew a sharp
line between himself and

Cheney. saying emphatically,
“I'm not the attorney general.‘

The governor spent
about one hour at the
festival site,

LOS ANGELES — AP-John D. Ehrlichrnan. former
top domestic adviser toPresidentNixon.hae been in-
dicted on charges of perjury. burglary. and con-
spiracy in the break-in at the office of Daniel
Ellsberg‘s psychiatrist. a source said Wednesday.

Three other former White House aides — Egil
Krogh. David Young. and convicted Watergate con-
spirator G. Gordon Liddy - also were indicted for
their alleged roles in the 1971 break-in. a reliable
source said.

Krogh was charged with solicitation ofaburglary.
conspiracy and aburglary. Liddy and Young were
charged with b urglary and conspiracy to commit a
burglary.

Elirlichmaan sent word through his attorney that
he will surrender here Tuesday. A districtatwrney‘s
spokesman said Ehrlichman would be arraigned the
same day after being booked. fingerprinted. and
photographed. Tuesday is the deadline set forvolun-
tary surrender of those indicted before arrest.
warrants would be issued.

The other three men were unavailable for com-
men t. Officials said it was expected they would sur-
render here although they have the option todo so
elsewhere

Sources close to the county grand jury. which
issued the indictment secretly Tuesday. indicated
that. the perjury charge resulted from contradictions
between Ehrl ichman's testimony here lastJune 8 in a
secret grand Jury session and his later public
testimony before the Senate Watergate committee ,

outer contradictions were believed to stint in
three memorandum presented to the grand jury dur-
ing its prob'e.

The White House interoffloe memos reportedly in-
volved Ehrlichman. Korgh and Young in plane for
the break-in. Krogh and Young headed the under-
cover White house “plumbers squad" charged with
plugging leaks of secret information.

I The indictment was ordered sealed until at least
one of those indicted had surrendered. and Diet.Atty.
Joseph Busch declined commenton the indentities of
those named.

The maximum sentence upon conviction for
burglary. conspiracy to commit a burglary and per-
jury is 1 to 14 years in prison on each count.The max-
imum sentence for solicitation is 1 to 5 years.

The probe here was an offshoot of the Pentagon
papers trial.

The trial judge revealed last April that he had been
told of a break -pin at the Beverly Hills office of Dr.
Lewis Fielding. who had once treated Ellsberg.

Later it was disclosed that Liddy and a conspirator.
E. Howard Hunt. had engineered the 1971 break-in at
the request of “the plumbers squad."

US. District Court Judge Matt. Byme dismissed
charges against Ellsberg and Anthony Russo
because of what he declared was government mie-
conduct.

Ehrlichman has maintained he did not know of the
break-in until after it occurred. although he
authorized "covert. activities" by the plumbers
squad.
