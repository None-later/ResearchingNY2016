What‘s 5'9". weighs 165 lbs.. is
extremely inconspicuous. and
has the arduous job of making
the Great Dane offense go? The
answer is mild-mannered .lohn
Bertuzzi. And although mild-
mannered may sound corny as
hell. it's really the only way you
can describe the sophomore QB
of the Albany Danes.

Coach Ford aptly calls him it
“total team player.“ Ford goes
on to say that the Danes realize
ttiatJohn puts the team firstand
his own new mplisliments se-
cond. and thatthis in itself is im-
portant.

l personally found out about
John's make-up when i tried in-
terviewing him last year. tic
wanted nothing to do With it. in-
ststing that there were other
guys more worthy of an inter-
view. and besides. he didn’t have
that much to do wrtli the team's
success.

On the contrary. John was
largely responsible for the
Danes. 6-1-1 record last season.
He's not a great passer. he‘s nota
great runner. btit he possesses
that mysterious quality of
leadership. And. of Winning.

lr‘ord suys,”lie's a unique kind
of guy. an athlete w itlt the ability
to lead our defense. He inspires
confidence. He's one of the
greatest leader's I've ever r'r-irr-lr
ed."

well. The basic play is the triple
option where the quarterback
can either ltarrd off to the
fullback. keep it. or pitch it. Un-
derstandably it requires splitse-

querit split second decisions.

The AMIA Scene

by Nathan Salant

This week‘s article is directed
especially towards the freshmen
and transfers to this university. I
hope to be able to supply you
with some information regar-
ding the intramural sportsseene
for the guys on this campus.

Have you ever tried to get up a
football game. and found
yourself stuck with it "big"2 on 2
game? ldver try getting 18 guys
fora softball game. and Wind up
with a 6 on 6 romp through
centerfield‘? Do you enjoy corri-
peting in swim meets. golf and
tennis matches. paddleball
games. etc? Wouldn‘t you enjoy
them even more in an organized
league? Ever have these
problems? interested in mak-
ing sortie money as an official?

The Albany Men‘s intramural
Association. or AMIA. is
probably the most inclusive
group on campus. Well over
3000 individual students par-
ticipate in this organization
eireli yeirr. Membership is
automatic if you are of the
eliiiiivmistie sex. and have |)tll(I
your strident tux.

'I'lie AMIA is run by a ('lHltlt‘lI
of H students and n member of
the student itt'LlVILIUH staff. Mr.
Ileniiis l'Ilkin. as advrsoi'.
Presently. there are two \‘ttt'llllL
seats on the eoriiieil. and n
sper-inl one for a freshman
representative. 'I'he ('tlllllt‘lI
meets on \lt’edliosrhiy nights at
7(ltl. and riiiikes all decisions
regarding sports offered. roles.

it is to make favorable changes.
Let me emphasize that all
meetings are open to all
members.

The football and soccer team
entry deadlines have passe

who wish to joina team may still
do so by visiting the Intramural
office in CC356. and speakingito
