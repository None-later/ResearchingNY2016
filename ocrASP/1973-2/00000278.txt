With last week's temperature
in the mid-nineties. most

'students sought refuge in any

cool spot they could find. but it
was still busi as usual for
Coach Robert Ford and his 106
Albany State Football players.
For them it was workouts once a
day during the week plus twicea
day on weekends as Ford and his
assistant coach Bob Murphy try
to mold these men into two
cohesive units.

it's a special year for Albany.
as the Danes embark on their
firstyearofvarsityfootballafter
three years at the club level.
Ford feels that “this is the
strongest team ever." However.
Ford cautions to add that "We are
no longer playing teams like
Pace any more." Among the new
opponents will be Nichols.
Curry and crosstown rival RPl.

The problem facing the Dane
football squad as well as other
Albany teams is the ability to
compete with other schools on
and off the field. One hundred
and fifty-six players originally
wentoutforthefootbaliteam but
30men had tobecutafterthefirst
workouts due to lack of equip-
ment and locker facilities. Ford
and Murphy are quite capable
coaches but the team is com-
peting against schools with six
full time coaches. The rest of
Albany's staff consists of part
time personnel and like every
other year the staff is new to the
school. Recruitment is still it
problem.

New Talent Revives Booters' Hopes

Beaten practicing liar e whian season

It should. however. be an ex-
citing first year for Albany. as
Coach Ford has developed some
excellent talent. The defense
should be better than last year‘s
superb squad with ten starters
returning and plenty ofdepth to
back the starters up. The defen-
sive line is soiidwitli ftudy Vido.
Vinnie Pierce. Frank Leader.
Hon Gardner. .llm "'l‘iny"
Holloway. Frank Villanova and
Dom Pagano all sure to putpien-
ty of pressure on opposing
quarterbacks.

'l‘he linebacking situation is
strong with the return of Ken
Solioen and Don Minn., Herm
Springertakcs overin the secon-
dary with the graduation of.lohn
Johnson. Joining Springer will
be captain Arnie Will. ’l‘im
Myers.Jefl'O'l)onnell.and Bruce
Cummings.

Offensively. the team has been
hurt through graduation. injury
and other personal reasons.
Sophomore John Bertuzzi
returns as the starting quarter-
back. Ford describes Bertuzzi as
a fine leader and "A hell of a
wishbone quarterback."
Currently there are five
freshmen battling for the second
string spot.

The key to the Danes offense
has been their running backs.
but the running corps has been
depleted with the departure of
Carvin Payne. Lonnie Davis.
Noel Walker and McCoy
Allister. 'l‘he blunt of the load
must fall to last year‘s super
freshman halfback Marvin
Perry. Coach Ford feels that
Perry looks real good and more

determined than ever. Vying for
the other halfback position are
freshmen George Hollie and
Orin Griffin. Both are excellent
prospects and both possess good
speed. Griffin runs the hundred
in 9.8. 'l‘om Deblois has the in-
side for the fullback position.

Last year's starting tight and
Ed l’crka has been forced to give
up football because of a back in-
Jury. Luckily for Ford. Bill
Adams is on hand to fill the posi-
tion. Adams. it transfer student
from Hudson Valley. was
employed as an offensive
lineman lastycar. while backing
up Perka.

When Bertuzzi did put the ball
into the air lastyear. his favorite
receiver was split end Bob Bax-
ter. Baxter is stronger. bigger
and faster than last year and
could have a big year. He is
being pressed by trackman Cliff
McCard. McCard has no
previous experience but his 9.7
speed could be a key asset.

The offensive line is a. t
shaky with depth belnga big fac-
tor. Returning starters are Ty
Curran. Mike Basia.center Andy
Lee. Joe Rinaldo and Bruce
Court. Missing will be Rick
Duell. who quit school.

The squad will scrimmage at
Union College tomorrow and
here against Hudson Valley the

following week before the
Danes‘ September 22. varsity
premiere. hosting Stony Brook.
The defense seems very strong.
How well the offense gels will
determine the success of
Albany's football team.

are considered to be solid

The questions are many:
Will the comparatively

Will that ever present
problem of discipline be
solved'.’ Lastly. will the
stigma of it losing team be
forgotten“?

An answer to that last
question can be soon in the
cliango in attitude of several
veterans who, for the first
time. have a really hopeful
outlook.

Coach Bill Schefflin
claims that this is the best
team in the past ten years at

comes down to: Can the team
win more than one game This

be seen.

years of construction.

According to Joel ’I‘ruc from
l’laiit Adiiiinisl ration. the vast
lllitJUl'lly of the Silt in the pond
now is the sandy soil (which
more closely resembles sand
than soil) turned up from
all the heavy construction
naturally needed to build a
monolith such as SUN Y Albany.
Very little siltliig is occurring
now from such natural sources
as runoff

The fact remains that the
banks of the pond have been
severely ci'odcd and that the bot-
tom is over three feet shallower
than it is supposed to be. Gary
Selwyn (Chemistry) and Paul
()‘liricn (Biologyl both un-
dergraduates here. compiled the
only chemical study ever done
on th is pond over ten months
ago. in which they cited the
serious silting problem which
has in some areas reduced the
bottom from five feet to six iii-
clies, ltecoinnicndations for
dredging were made at that time

speedy action would follow.

According to Selwyn. silting
is an immediately correctable
problem. The dredging. in con-
junction with the reinforcement
of the banks with clay will solve
the problem quite satisfactorily.
In addition. Selwyn and O'lirien
support the implanting of open-
cnd pipes from the banks deep
into the surrounding soil to

relievo the pressure exerted on
the banks by the massiveilmounl
of ground water
around the lake. The ground

up the now empty. dried out lake
in less than two days.

The dredging of the lake was
