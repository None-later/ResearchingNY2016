Gerber Demands Investigation
On Legality of Firearms Use

The student government presi-
dent of the State University of
New York at Albany has charged
that some security officers on
State University campuses have
been making improper arrests
and. in some cases. bearing
firearms without the proper
training.

Steven Gerber. an un-
dergraduate student and Presi-
dent 6f the SUNY-Albany Stu-
dent Association. said an in-
vestigation conducted in con-
junction with the Albany legal
firm of Rosenblum and
Leventhal revealed that a
special training course for the
university's security officers
hasnotsutisfied StateEducaticn
Law requirements for
designating a graduate of the
program a ' peace officer."

Only specially trained peace
officers can execute arrest
warrants and. with the approval
of tlic local campus president.
carry firearms. The training

must consist of “the minimum
‘ training required forlocalpolice
officers by the Municipal Police
Training Council." according to
the StateEducation Law.
Gerber said university of-
ficials apparently operated Un-
der the mistaken belief that a
special four week State Univer-
sity of New York "Training
School for Campus Security Of-
ficers" fulfilled the trainiug re-
quirements. “But,” Gerber con-
tinued. "according to our legal
counsel. that course produces
security officers - not peace of-
ficers."

Under state law. security of-
ficers are prohibited from carry-
ing firearms or making arrests.

Gerber‘s View was verified by
Charles C. McCloskey. .li'..
Director oftfie state's lliireau for
Municipal Police. McCloskey
explained thtt in order to obtain
peace officer status. campus
security officers must take the
same training course mandated
for municipal police agencies.

McCloskey backed Gerber's
contention that the four week
long State University training
course did not legally give
security officers who passed it
the higher peace officer status.

“That course certifies a stu-
dent to be acampus security off-
ficer, not a peace officer.“
McCloskey said.

Gerber added that only six of
SUNY-Albany‘s forty«eight
member security force have
passed the required course to be
a peace officer.

Gerber pledged the entire
security issue would be brought
before the Monday afternoon
meeting of the SUNY-
Albany University Senate for
consideration. He said a bill
backed by the Student Associa-
tion UlllIIllg for the investigation
of the use of firearms ‘ and the

WINFIELD. W. Va. AP — Sheriff’s deputies. acting
on a tip from a squirrel hunter, have harvested a
cultivated field of marijuana and four alleged pot;
farmers.

Putnam County Deputy Sheriff Dennis Edwards
said the four were arrested when they came to the
isolated marijuana plot about five miles from here
Sunday.

At the time. deputies were chopping down about
500 plants. some of which were 10 feet high. Edwards
said. The plants were healthy, well cultivated and
apparently had been growing most of the summer.
he said. Police estimated the market value of the
harvest at $30,000.

WASHINGTON AP ~ The House voted contempt
action today against Watergate conspirator G. Gor—
don Isiddy for his refusal to testify before House .

'l‘he 334—to»11 vote in effect turned the matter over
to the US. attorney‘s office for prosecution.

Conviction carries a maximum one-year jail
sentence and $1,000 fine, Liddy already is in jail for
contempt of court due to his refusal to tell what he
knows about the Watergate affair.

The House contempt action stemmed from his
refusal even to take the swearing-in oath in July
before the [louse intelligence SlleUlllfllllI(‘t' which
was probing alleged Central Intelligence Agency
connections with Watergate,

Iiiddy'H lawyer contended that under the Con-

the oath.

The current shortage of
available meat attributed to
President Nixon‘s Phase 1V
price guidelines has forced the
SUNYA Faculty-Student
Association to adopt restraining
measures in order to insure
satisfactory continuation of the
meal programs here.

The most notable of these
measures is the abolisliment of
unlimited seconds of the meat
dishes served in the quad
cafeterias. Norbert Za‘fim. FSA
director. stressed in an inter:
view the alternative. non-meat

Hit hardest by the crisis is the
Kosher meal plan. The cost of
Kosher meat has and will be ris-
ing much more steeply than
other meat: the FSA Food Ser~
vice has been fighting a deficit
due to these inflated costs. and
has not been able to compensate
for the 1055 despite attempts to

Less Meat on Plates

Food Service was not un-
prepared for the impending meat
crisis. As early as June 1973.
Food Service Director Richard

A. Finke began to accumulate
$250,000 in food inventory forthe
SUNYA cafeterias. ordering
earlier and in greater quantity
than usual in anticipation of the
shortage. In addition to a short
supply of meat. raw produce has
also become a difficult good to
obtain lately.Thisinavailability
of fruits and vegetables is at-
tributable to the unwillingness
of the wholesalers to sell raw
produce until price restrictions
are lifted on September 12. Pro-
jecting the cffectsoftlie liftingof

sured that all efforts will be
made to keep from increasing
the prices of food at the Campus

necessrty to do so.
