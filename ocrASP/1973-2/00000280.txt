We can say whatever we
want toabout Nixon. We
can call him a war
criminal. we can call him
a iacistwe can call hima

call him a racist. or we
can call him what he

so inspile of everything.

violating the first law of a

So history will
ultimately judge all of us
responsible. The early
seventies will go down as
a period of government
corruption and public
aquiescencc. Richard
Nixon will go down as the
President whose
administration was

Watergate while the
people will be
