The Roots of Watergate :
lt Started in the Classroom

by Douglas LeComte
In the news this last summer it
was Watergate, Watergate,
Watergate. The Senate hearings
on T.V. gave us a close-up look of
how the (pick one)
b) military, c) mind
operates. It was the don'tAmake-

a) corporate,
statist

waves, don't-back-the-crowd, l-
was-only—following-orders kind of
mentality which was so evident as
the witnesses were paraded
before the Ervin committee. In-
dividual morality was smothered

come to mind. Nobody wanted to
upset the pecking order of things.

Nobody had the courage to
stand up and say' HI want out,
this is wrong; lwon't take part in
it."

Yes, the group. Acceptance in
the group is all that counts. From
kindergarten through high school
you are called upon and ex-
pected to be part of the “team,”
to make sacrificies for the sake of
the group, and to form un-
breakable bonds cit affection for
your homeroom, school, city,
county, and state, even though it
was often as not purest fuck a
coincidence that put you there

in the first place.

And if you decided to forsake
the group and follow your own
dictates, then it was generally
conceded by teachers and
parents alike that you were
withdrawn and anti-social and
something had to be done to br-
ing you back into the fold and
rescue you from your erratic
behavior, Backward and
deficient children were even to
be promoted wnh their peers, so
that poor little Johnny, even
though he wouldn't learn to read
or write, would not feel "left out"
and no longer a port of the
group, In colleges, scholarship
and achievement were to be dis-
couraged with pass-fail grading
systems replacing traditional
ones,

Perhaps we are reaping the
rewards of John Dewey in educa»
tion; the stress on group achieve-
ment, the denigrating of in-
dividual achievement, the idea
that getting along with the group
should be the prime measuring
stick of the child's progress in
education, the notion that there
are no fixed moral laws or eternal
truths.

It is only a short step from here
to the attitude that t can do
something that is wrong because

a) everybody else is doing it. or

wrongdoing, ten apologists will
crop up to say it was not his fault,
he was under group pressure, he
is only a product of his environ-
ment, he did not know right from
wrong or similar such trite non-
sence.

And the truth is that many of
the people so loudly condemning
the Nixon administration are the
people who persistently support
the collectiwsvist group mentality
philosophy prevalent at this time
and so well displayed by the Nix
on people Dewey had his conter
pa rts in economics, politics,
sociology, and psychology and
most of the professional Nixon
haters support the banal ideas,
immoral theories, and parasitic
anti-individualist philosophies
promulgated by this
breed of men.

WOllYty

So maybe some of those who
call themselves progressives or
liberals, who keep denying in-
dividual responsibility and
freedom of choice, ought to take
a deep look at the sickness that is
Watergate and see where the
climate that bred this kind of
morality originated. the rot lies
close to home

 

 

S.A. President Steve Gerber‘s recent disclosure thatcampus
security personnel may not be legally qualified to carry gum,-
and exercise other privileges of a “peace officer" raises a
number of serious questions.

The "independent investigation" ordered by Central Council
concludes that there is an incongruity between what the law
states. what trustee guidelines prescribe. and what the actual
situation is. Apparently, SUNY-Central o.k.‘d a too Wtiiik
training course for its security personnel. while the la v “-
quires an eight-week course for certification as a "peace ltl
ficer." Trustee regulations state that such actions as itl’l'ir‘tlx
and the bearing of firearms are restricted to those persoi Ill‘l
designated "peace officers.“ What it comes down to is that ii is
now possible. if not actual. for a person to believe himself .i
peace officer and exercise the privilegees of one while in ftii'l
he is not so qualified. It is a disturbing thoughtlf. upon in

S.U.N.Y.A. Saga

by D. Schnookelbuum

With the craze for nostalgia, I,
Dorothea Schnookelbaum, have
decided to recreate 1950's
college life, by describing the
quaint existence of 1970's
Albany. With the serialized
adventures of myself, a
homespun, small-town girl from
“the Island,” hoping to make it
big as iust another ID. number
in this dynamic and metropolitan,
"Capital District" university, I
will tell my struggles. Apologies to
Jon Guttman; eat your heart out,
John Galsworthy!

“Oh Henrietta, Henrietta! Look
at Phyllis, and Lomonte in that
body.” Alter an ever so slight top
to my apathetic roommate, | ex-
claimed, “Not his, I meant the ‘57
Chevy”

"Well, I’ve told you about my
sister and Lamonte, and you
know Phyllis is a senior. Sorry
about the wound; l used to
spar with Muhammed
Ali, and besides how could you
see Lamonte so well? It‘s so darn
dark in this room. You'd have
thought that Edward Durrell

Stone was born in a tomb, not a
womb. I cannot see a thing.”
“No matter," Henrietta explain-
ed, “l really won’t have time for
dates. Mortuary science is a dif-
ficult field of study, and I'll only
have time for the silent types."
After unpacking their fifty pai-
rs of torn and artfully patched
icons and a dress they’ll share,
the girls run down to their first,
hearty meal. Undiscouraged by
several students, they
enter the dining
