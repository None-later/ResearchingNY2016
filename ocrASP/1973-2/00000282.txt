Last week at the half
filled Palace theatre, se-
cond billed to the New
Riders of The Purple
Sage, was the Fabulous
Rhinestones. a group
from NY. State living
now in nearby Woodstock,
and veterans of many
N.Y. and Long Island
area clubs. The group
multi-talented and ver-
satile are now understan-
dably very discouraged
with the predominantly
Albany State crowd in
attendance Thursday
past. Admittedly lead
guitarist Dale states....“it
was a very young crowd
not really in age but in

musical. maturation and
respectability."

Yes. it was quite a good
set. not as good as some of
their past downstate per-
formances: but it is very
difficult toput out when
some few in attendance
are yelling “New Riders"
all through your set.
Think about the poor peo-
ple present who did not
like theN.R.P.S..andthe
hard time any group
would have ‘getting
down” to such outcries.

The Rhinestones came

Van Morrison's latest
release. “Hard Nose The
Highway" (BS 2712). is
not the “Jackie Wilson
Said" material that we
heard last year at this
time. Rather. Van
Morrison is reminiscing
on different times ofyear.
as well as aspects of life.
and he explores the mood
to be found with each. For
this reason. the songs are
set against a. background
where soft electric guitar.
piano. and strings are the
most prominent in-
struments. while the
horns on which Morrison
is usually so dependent
become played down. and
are only ocassionally
brought to the forefront.
Most important to the
songs are Morrison‘s
vocals and lyrics. and the
music as a whole.
Generally on the softer
side. the songs may be in-
dicative ofanew direction
and emphasis for
Morrison. He may be com-
posing as Paul Simon
does. Simon feels that it is
importantfor him to write
for his own age group.

It is probably a. coin-
Cidence. but the first cut
on the album. "Show in
Anselmo". features it
chorus which brings to
mind the chorus in

Simon‘s “Save the Life of

Van Morrison is accom-
panied by the Oakland
Symphony Chamber
Chorus. which is used a
bit more heavily. This
manages to convey a
wintery feeling but
carefully avoids the
Christmas carol sound. In
one of the few instances
on the album. Morrison
uses horns here in sec-
tions which are probably
the loudest rock parts of

the album. in order to
break the established
mood. These are jux«

taposed against the tran-
quil proceedings wellas
against the chorus. which
comes in once again dur-

probably the mostsimilar

enough to keep away any

"Wild Children” is a

song won't be of any in-

ment. as well as a subtle
but effective use of vibes.
As a whole.the songlacks
interest. The vocal “dut-
dubbing" Morrison ex-
changes with the strings
is either amusing or very
interesting: I haven't
made up my mind. Butthe
main problem is that I
have an immense liking
for the Byrd‘s version
(which. on 5—D. was called
"Wild Mountain Thyme")
The harmonies they put
into their two-and-ahalf
ininute rendition surpass
by far the vocalization
that Morrison puts into a
long five minutes.

The outstanding song of
the album lS so in a very
qutet way. "Autumn
