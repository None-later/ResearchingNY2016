by Harvey Kojan

The Albany Great Danes foot-
ball team. sporting their newly
acquired title of 'varslty' for the
first time. passed their initial
test of the season as they
whipped Union in a controlled
scrimmage this past Saturday.
The fact that they were vie-
torious is not the truly signifi—
cant factor. however. What is
noteworthy is the manner in
which they performed. and
although it can be stated with
some certainty that they were
not poetry in motion, there are
several positive conclusions
that can be drawn.

Quarterback John Bertuzzi
directed a consistent attack in
the first half. bolstered mainly
by the running of Marvin Perry
and GeorgeHollie. Hollie. one of
the many freshmen to be found
on this year's squad. was par—
ticularly effective, speeding 30
yards early in the game. This
fact should be especially pleas-
ing to 'intimate Albany rooters
who realize the evacuation of
running backs. which started
taking place lastyearnowhereto
be seen are McCoy Allister. Noel
Walker. Lonnie Davis.orCarvin
Payne.

Replacing them are a host of
freshmen. headed by Home and
Orin Griffin. another fine
prospect. One of the major
problems with the team last
season was the number of
fumbles. With
freshmen operating together in
the wishbone offense. 'it remains
to be seen whether a slackening
in the turnover department will
occur. Nevertheless, the ability
to move the ball which Albany
displayed was definitely a good
sign.

The Danes may seem to have a
revolvnig door With regards to
backs. but this is not the case
witii the offensive and defensive

lines. which are Virtually intact

quick look at the offensive line
shows Bill Adams at tight end.

Court at left guard. Andy Lee at
center. Joe Rinaldo at right
guard, Mike Basla atrighttaekle
and the club's number one
receiver, Bob Baxter at splitend.

sell off—
swe line is a must for any con-

tending ballclub. and it appears
that this is a specific plus in
Albany's favor. And ifany of the
aforementioned players should
be unable to play, .100 Amedore
is around to fill in capany at
both center and guard.

The defense. which was
always good and at times
brilliant last season. showed no
signs of weakening. as they
st fled the Union offense
repeatedly in the early going. As
a matter of fact. the first defen—
sive squad did not permit a
touchdown. and it was only later
in the contest when both teams
were experimenting that Union
was able to put some points on
the board. Tackle .liin "'l'iny"
llolloway was qu1te excellent.
and with regulars fi‘rank

returning to the lineup. there
should prove to be an interesting
battle there. The other defensive
line standouts. Ron Gardner.
Vinnie Pierce. Rudy Vido. and
Frank Leader should provide the
Danes with more than ample
strength and depth on the line.

Meanwhile the secondary is
anchored by the ever-present
Jeff O'Donnell. who picked off
two passes Saturday. and cor-
ners Arnie Will and 'l‘iinniy
Myers. And With returning
linebackers Ken Schoen and Don
Mion. the entire defenSive squad
taken as a whole which was
directly responsible for the
team's fine showing last your.
looks to have lost nothing but
gained the intangible but impor-
tant factor of experience,

New Plan for Tuition Payments;
Students to be Billed Earlier

 
    

by David Harrienger

Assistant Vice-President
Robert Stierer has an—
nounced a. new plan to make

all students pay their spring

tuition. room. board and fees
by registration day, January
itth. All students will be
billed prior to registration.
and failure to pay by then
will cause cancellation of a
student's eligibility to attend
classes.

The details of the plan have
yet to be worked out. but
should be finalized and dis—
tributed by October lst.
Following are the proposals.
all of which are tentative:

Students continuing study
from the previous semester
will be pro-billed. and the
Bursar‘s office will estimate
the student's bill. basing the
estimate on the bill for the
previous semester.

 

   

New students attending
SUNYA for the firsttime will
be allowed to estimate their
own bill. Forms will be sent
out by the bursar‘s office. on
which the student will
calculate his costs and pay
the proper amount. The bur-
sar's office will check all the
bills. SUNY at Binghamton
has used this method in their
bill collections. and is
reportedly having success
with it.

 

Regents and other
scholarship holders can
show official proof as
authorization to have their
payment deferred, All
stndciits With accounts
payable who do not show of-
ficial authorization will be
finalized and nii‘oriiiation
distributed on October lst.
according to Sticrer.

The new procedures were
deemed necessary by univer-
sity officials because the pre-
seiit system creates large un-
paid bills i'or the university

since student bills are not
fully collected until long

after the semester has

started. Late collection of

money has proved very dif-
ficult. especially in the case
of students leaving school.
There is also a university

regulation which states that

all tuition is payable on the
first day of classes.

The bursar's office had
hoped to start the new
system with the fall
seiiiostor. but, according to
b‘tierer, could not Work out
problems with the various
financial aid programs in
time to put the new plan into

_ effect. Aletter distributed to

   

students during the summer
explained that the new
system would be in effect this
spring.

The bursar‘s office first
tightened up its collection
procedure in the fall of 1971.
when it sent a letter to
students requiring them to
pay by January or face
cancellation. 5700 stops on
registration for the spring
term were issued. but only
one student had his atten-
dance actually cancelled.
liased on this past ex-
perience. it is expected
students will work well with
the new system. Most of the
SUNY colleges already use
early collections. either in
advance of registration or by
the start of classes. said
Stierer. Albany is one of the
last state university units to
adopt early payment.

The difficulty of the un~
iversity in collecting the
bills under the current
system is illustrated by the

fact that last year. over 2,000
accounts were unpaid for
that your alone. The state at-
torney general. to whom
overdue bills are referred.
has a special task force
assigned to the collection of
these payments. mostly from
dropouts. Since 1965. they
lie ve processed bills. and are
u.” up to the spring 1969
term.

'l‘h no w pay men t procedure
is being worked out as a joint
effort of several departments
involved: Admissions.
Financial Aids. Student Af-
fairs. Student Life. Graduate
Studies. Academic Affairs.
Residence. University
College. the registrar and the
bursar. All these offices are
being consulted by Stierer in
finalizing the plans.

Bursar Acquino: Cracking down hard.

in deciding what methods
to use. a committee headed
by Mr. Edmund Klee. from
the office of management
analysis. visited several
college campuses in the area,
including NYU. Penn. State.
Binghamton. and Buffalo.
Mr. Klee. and Mr. Acquino.
university bursar. Mrs.
Kathleen Molinary. assis-
tant bursar. and Mrs.
Patricia Fisher. of the Office
of Mnagement Analysis.
were on this research com-
mittee.

A study is currently under
way by a management
analysis unit studying the
operation of the bursar‘s of—
fice. This committee is ex-
pected to recommend some
changes in the organization
of the bursar's office. Most
likely these will entail a
separation of the student ac—
counts function from that of
the collection and dispersion
of cash from other sources.
Some accounting functions
will probably also be assign-
ed to the accounting office.

 

   

   
 
 

These recommendations.
mentioned also in previous
audits. have problems in the
timing. implementation.
staff. and apce requirements
which would have to be dealt
With before they could be ini-
plemeiitcd.

The amount of money that
was collected lust your
totaled seventeen million
dollars. of which some ten
million dollars was in
billings for tuition. nearly
two million dollars of tuition
fees being waivered for
various reasons. such as for
graduate students. foreign
and disadvantaged students.
and employees. Almost four
million dollars went for
room rentals. 'l‘lie seventeen
million total includes tui-
tioii. room. board. fees. and
scholarships.
