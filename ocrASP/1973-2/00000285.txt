NEWS BRIEFS

compiled by Barry Schwartz

SANTIAGO: GHILE'AP The new military junta buried
Salvador Allende on Wednesday and' then was reported
to have formally taken over power in a ceremony at Ber-
nardo O’Higgins Military School.

The official radio said _a new cabinet was sworn in at
the ceremony. but the names of the ministers were not
released.

There had been rumors the coup leaders were con-
sidering Gabriel Valdes. a former foreign minister and
now a top U. N. official, for the presidency oflghe coun-
try. But Valdes said Wednesday in Lima, Peru, on the
first leg of a trip home from New York. that “I will accept
no offer for that kind of a job because I'm happy with
what I'm now doing."

WASHINGTON AP - Watergate special prosecutor
Archibald Cox says that U. S. District Judge John .J.
Sirica's ruling in the White House tapes case had the
effect of excluding evidence from the grand jury rather
than obtaining it.

In a supplementary brief filed late Wednesday. Cox
asked the U. S. Court of Appeals not to “shrink from en»
try of a coercive order" directing President Nixon to
turn over the tapes to the Watergate grand jury.

Cox. White House lawyers. and counsel for Sll‘iCit
argued their positions before a seven—judge Appeals
Court panel Tuesday. The special prosecutor was given
until Friday to file any additional written arguments
but had them ready within 24 hours.

The White House has until next Wednesday to file its
response.

An Appeals Court decision in the case is expected by

Oct. 1. It is expected toend up before the Supreme Court.

Cox had subpoenaed White House tapes of nint-
Watergate-related presidentail conversations. The
President refused to comply. He contended that a presi.
dent cannot be compelled to obey a court order,

The issue was argued before Sirica who said that
before he could decide whether the President had it
legitimate basis for withholding the tapes. he would
have to listen to them in private.

The White House then asked the Appeals Court to
throw out Sirica‘s order on the grounds the District
Court judge lacked the power to order the President to
hand over the tapes.

Cox also disputed Sirica's order. The special
prosecutor said the tapes should be given to the grand
jury or. at least. he should be allowed to listen to them
along with Sirica.

_: Davis, Gerber ASSail .Lack'O-f I
~ Student Input On Appointment

by Glenn von Nostitz

Student Association Presi-
dent Steven Gerber and Vice-
President Barry Davis
charged Wednesday that stu-
dent leaders were “ignored”
and that no attempts were
made to consult student opi-
nion in the recent appoint-
ment of Richard Kendall as
acting Associate Dean for
Behavioral and Social
Sciences. Kendall. formerly
history department chair-
man. was appointed in July
to replace Melvin K. Bers.

Gerber claims that he was
"informed. but not con-
sulted" on the appointment
and Davis says that. "It was
another one of those
decisions where students
were informed. but never
consulted." Gerber asks:
"How could they fail to be
aware of the student opinion
on Dr. Kendall?"

Kendall is considered to be
a controversial figure
because of his role in campus
politics and his opposition to
the tenure bid of popular
history professor David
Goodman.

Gerber and Davis see the
alleged lack of consultation
as particularly serious in
light of events last Spring
during which students stag-
ed a sit-iii in President
Benezet‘s office in large part
because they felt they were

not being adequately con-
sulted on tenure and other
key decisions.

After the Gerber and Davis
allegations were made. Vice-
President Phillip Sirotkin
was reached for comment. He
claimed that “there was con-
sultation with students“ but
added that it was “not for-
mal." He was unable to list
names or the procedure used
for cons ultation. but
suggested that SA President
Gerber “is the one to ask"
about when the consultation
took place and who was in-
volved in it.

Sirotkin elaborated that
there is usually “minimal
consultation" when only an
acting appointment is being
made. but thatstudentwould
serve on the search com—
mittee to find L‘. permanent
replacement.

Taken for Gran ted

Davis also charged that the
alleged lack of consultation
“shows once again their
ability to take students and
faculty for granted when
making a decision". The Stu-
dent Association Vice—
President said he told
Sirotkin that. he would be
"disappointed and upset" if
be appointed anyone “to be
acting Dean of Arts and
Sciences." Added Davis: "He

really took me literally by
not consulting us when nam-
ing the Associate Dean."

Davis draws a parallel
between the Kendall ap-
pointment and the decisions
made earlier on the use of
Mohawk Tower. the in-
troduction of firearms on
campus. and the parking
decisions last year as “all
unilaterally made.“

Gerber said that there was
“no excuse" for not con-
sulting the student leaders
since “all three officers were
in Albany at the time."
