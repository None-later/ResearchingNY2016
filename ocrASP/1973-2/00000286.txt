Sometimes you notice
them, and sometimes they
hang unseen. Obnoxious
blots of color. hastily

adhered like a treasure of,

misfit trading stamps:
desperate messages
hailing salvation and half-
price sci-fi paperbacks:
THESE are the essence of
contemporary university
communication! THESE are
the words of today's youth.
leaders of tomorrow! THESE
are one of the major causes of
primary land pollution!
Yes. of course. I'm speak-
ing of the creative.
humorous. and socially
significant array of posters.
flyers. and crayon-and-
looseleaf communiques that
adorn Albany State's many
bulletin boards. walls. and
14in. X 14in. white concrete
pillars. I‘m sure you're at
least AWARE of these
modestly penned messages.
And I'm willing to bet a 1931
Buffalo nickel that you've
even gone as far as reading
some of their slightly uneven
lines during your hours in
front of the 0.0. or while

waiting for the cafeteria
doors to open. But have you
ever...well, have you ever
read BETWEEN those lines
(so to speak)? Has the hidden
message lurking BEHIND
that penciled plea ever
reached your sensitive and
humanistic awareness? No.
huh? Well. there IS a lot up
on that there bulletin board
that takes some looking for.
And I don't mean by having
to lift up one message to see
the one that's stapled behind
it.

“Due to a job action of the
workers of the Capital Dis-
trict Dog Pound. we are un-
able at this time to procure
the types of quality meat you
are accustomed to. We will do
our best to...alleviate this
problem...ln the meantime.
however. we ask you to limit
yourselves to 2 guinea-pig
burgers per student..." This
subtle memorandum is (or
was) to be found in the
cafeteria at Colonial Quad.
No. I'm serious. The obvious
attempt at outright humor
does little to mask the dis-
content. the fiery contempt
for a beaurocratic establish-
ment that utterly disregards

the needs and wishes of the
proletariat. It's astriking ex-
ample of that “underlying
message" sort of thing that
students direct at other
students. while resident ad-
ministrators guffaw in their
superficial interpretation of
such dispatches.

Other such informalpieces
around campus provide
similar ambiguity and a
chance to raise almost
mysterious hidden
meanings from their content.
One of these is the magic
markered notice announcing
the sale of someone’s "Bob
Dylan Collection: 14 Dylan
records. 6 Dylan posters. 3
Dylan books plus pictures
and clippings." This
enigmatic article obviously
marks the final Death of
Woodstock Nation. the end of
the Age of Aquarius. and the
extinction of the Pepsi
Generation. It is a sad eu-
logy. yet it's writer does not
give up hope. he or she mere-
ly transfers it to the only
definite and lasting promise
left. Which is. of course.

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER M l ‘r

  

 

 

 

by Michael Sena

At night. the tunnels are a
great place to be in. for those
students who haven't had
enough heat in the daytime.
With an approximate
temperature of 110 degrees
the tunnels offer an excellent
opportunity to sweat
profusely. I. however. went
in the tunnels to do some ex-
ploring. and to show that
adventuring is not dead at
Albany State.

As I straggled along un-
derneath the Education
Building. I noticed a few
other hardy souls who were
down here. with damp
foreheads and sweaty arm-
pits. What the hell are they
doing here? What am I doing
here?

Moving along. I noticed a
lady with high—heeled clip-
clop shoes following me. I
have a frightful suspicion
that she works for an enemy

could be out to get my top

her evrl grasp. I must con-
fess riiy exploring is only a
front to cover up my premier
(ilJJL‘CllVU to gather m-
telligence data on the struc»
ture and operations oi the
tunnels.

Underneath the Campus
Center. at the crossroads of
the tunnels. there are three
giant garbage bins that emit
the worst odorr I have ever
had the misfortune to smell.
No unrilogy can quite fit the
stem-h tllill those bins had.

least if Nature calls I'll be
prepared because I‘m lean-
ing on 89 large boxes of dou-
ble fold toilet paper (the kind
we get), with 17 larger boxes
of regular toilet paper (the
kind they get) on my left.

Moving further along. I
noticed a balding man with a
mustache and attache case
entering the tunnels. He
must have followed the trail
of sweat that I left behind. Be-
ing in too much of a hurry. I
forgot to cover my tracks.
Anyway. this man gave me

the weirdest look that you'll
\ :ver' imagine. I can't really
blame him. If I saw a guy
wandering around in the
tunnels with an open
notebook and pen at the
ready. I would do a double-
take too.

liy far the strangest incr-
dent occurring on this
journey was when this
bearded student in a green '1‘-
shirt came storming by lllc.
Upon seeing me. he came to a
screeching halt. (Oh-oh. the
enemy conspiracy has track-
od me down and are going to

and fearful for my life. I
answered affirmatively. I
told him. “Yes. I'm gathering
intelligence information for
our government on the
tunnels." He. too.replied that
he was investigating the
tunnel situation. What a fool!
Doesn‘t he know that it's like
a steam bath in here?
