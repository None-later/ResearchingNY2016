by Andrea Carson

Approximately one hun-
dred and fifty women and
men in varying stages of
enlightenment attended the
first Women's Liberation
meeting of the year which
was held Monday evening.
The steering committee dis-
cussed the fall schedule. the
birth control clinic on cam—
pus. the new Women's Center
and then opened the discus-
sion to enthusiastic par-
ticipants.

Ideas proposed by group
members included the for-
mation of a Rape Clinic and a
Self'Help Clinic. Interest
was shown in the develop-
ment of a selfdefense class
for women on a more ad-
vanced level. a week-end at
Dippikill. a movement to
protect the abortion law from
Right to Life gronps. and a
class in automotive repairs.

Members of the steering
committee. Barbara
Matilsky (President). and
Patti Maslinoff (Treasurer).
imphasized that they did not
wish to dominate the group
and urged interested
members to develop and pur-
sue project ideas.

group, which include

stereotyping and dis-
crimination on campus.were
presented for those new to

the ideas of Women‘s Libera-
tion. Ms. Matilsky emphasiz-
ed that the Women's Libera-
tion group serves to educaste

 

the campus community to
problems women encounter
through the use of films and

speakers. and provides a
communication link among
female students.

The functions and
workings of the con-
sciousness raising group. an
important component of
women's liberation. were
outlined and participants

discussed the merits of such
a group. While some pointed
that the C-R group could
easily degenerate into a
“bullshit session", the con-
sensus was that the 0-H.
group was of great value in
helping women to deal with
their problems.
Through the efforts of last
year's group. a birth control
clinic will be opened by the
Student Health Services.
Contraception and counsel-
ing will be available to the
u ni versity community
beginning in October.
Another innovation is the
Women‘s Center which
opens Monday September 17
at 9 A.M. Located on State
Quad. Cooper Hall. Room
100. the Center will serve as a
resource area for literature
and tapes. a meeting place
for women and a coordina-
tion center for various ac-
tivities. Those interested in
joining a consciousness
raising group or any activi-
ty or creating a new project
committee can sign up at the
Women's Albany Center.
Hours will be posted in next
week‘s ASP.

Hartley also stated that the
present situation of those
carrying guns maintained
until SUNYA heard word
from SUNY Central as well
as McCloskey. Gerber stated
that he had learned from
McClosky that only "pcacc
officers" are permitted to
bear firearms.

“Peace officers" can be
designated only after they
have taken a special course
of the Municipal Police
Training Council, as op-
posed to the program under
the authorization of SUNY
Central that security officers
normally take. There has
been some question on this

The institution of fall elec-
tions is part of an effort to in-
crease student involvement
in Student Association af-
fairs. These elections are es-
pecially advantageous to
freshman and transfers who.
for the first time. are being
given not only the power to
elect some of their represen-
tatives for this year but also
the opportunity to run for
these positions themselves.
Self-nomination forms are
being accepted in the SA of—

Voting and positions are also
