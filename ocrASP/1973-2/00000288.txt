A-Duy Belles Apathy

Last Saturday‘s Activities Day
was perhaps the most encouraging
event to occur on this campus in a
long time. The record turnout
astounded everyone; sign-up lists
for participating groups were far
greater than anticipated. If
organizations have collective
egos. they certainly were
bolstered. All told. it was a great
opportunity to see and be seen: to
learn. to share and to enjoy.

 

While predictably the "joining"
fervor will cool, and promises i
made in spurts of enthusiasm will ‘
weaken. what happened lastSatur-
day is important in another
respect. It showed that with proper
organization and timing.
successful events are possible.

Perhaps this year's Activities
Day will make the standard and
overused excuse of “apathy” less
tenable. So often it‘s not apathy
itself. but rather the belief that
everyone is apathetic that dis-
courages success even before an
event is out ofthe planning stages.

Activities Day set a precedent.
one which would be wise to follow
A mood has now been struck. a
success been recorded. It 18 now up
to us to "do with it what we Will.-

President “Inoperative” so
Impeachment is Necessary

This letter is in reference to your “editorial” in the September 7 issue
of the ASP. I do believe you’ve taken the rational position in relation to
the inherent dangers of impeachment. As you stated, if is a “breeding
ground of disasfer" and should be approached with great caution. Bul
fhere are some weaknesses in your supportive reasons for not con-
sidering impeachment, “and why we shouldn'i.”

In your first paragraph you point out that “it's still too early to pin
down any specific charges of wrongdoing on any of Mr. Nixon’s top
....or former aids." As I'm sure you're aware, Mr. Erlichmon, number 3
man while he was at the White House, has been indicted and specificalv

ly charged with burglary, conspiracy, and perjury in the 1971 break-in
of the office of Daniel Ellsberg's former psychiatrist. Also indicted in rela-
iion lo the break-in, were Egil Krugh, Erlichmon's lop assistant and
David Young, a former aid to Henry Kissinger.

These developments have been quite recenl and possibly you weren't
aware of them when the ediloriol was submitted. Though surely the
long-standing indictments against Maurice Slons and John Mitchell
stand as specific charges. (In the case of the Mitchell—Stems indictments,
even though they weren't covered in the hearings, there have been links
established between Mr. Vesco and the Cubon’s caught in the break-in
of the Watergate complex.)

The second point you make isthot this “current lirode... is but another
chapter in the long war between Mr. Nixon and his enemies." Here
possibly lies the main crux of our President's problems. His enemies, as
he sees lherri are: the couch, who ask him to give up his lupes; the con-
gress, for selling up the Watergate panel and “showing a disappointing
periormance;" and finally the press.

We have on "inoperative" President. One who ok_s ill people lo
leave Walergale to lhe courts, than states he will abide only by a
"definitive" rulinghe himself being the iudge of what a “definitive ruling

is.

We have u presidenl who works out Ci "strategy" or bottle plan
against a senate inquiry. Teslimony shows that in furiive effort to dis-
credit the committee members, he voiced no obiection to “dirt” digging
on several senators (ex. Senator Weicker).

We have a Presidenl who repeatedly condemns the press for printing
innuendo and leaks. The some press ("vigorous") that through hard long
hours of work uncovered this mess.

In short we have on embollled President. And us the Seplember
7th New York Times editorial by James Reslon sums it up; Mr. Nixon's
mosl serious problem is the complicated stole of his troubled personality.

Yes, we have only one President and he must be treated as such. But Il
may come in be that in lhu face of more substantiated evidence of ms
conduct we may have no olltei‘ ullurnulive, and in ihal case: impeach we
niusl!

Yours truly,
Richard Edcliiiun ‘77

Your pOinls are well taken However, lwould like lo pornl out that you

crr if you believe that Mr. Nixon l‘) inoperative. He is :iolyei. Therefore

he should not be impeachedin llionks for writing.

Fritz Defended

To the Editor:

Just as Iris Alexander and
Stephanie Stewart were displeas-
ed by Fritz the Cat, l was iusf as
displeased with what they had to
write about ii. To begin with i
would like to say something that
might need reiterating in light of
Watergate; America stands for
freedom and included in that
freedom is freedom from cen-
sorship. I know it's difficult but i
feel that we should all lry to keep
that freedom in spite of the recent
Supreme Court decision. I am oc-
luolly appalled at the suggestion
that the films shown in lhe future
be carefully screened. | lirivc a
mind and I don’t need, and ldoin'i
wnnl anybody else deciding
upon which films i can or cannot
see. I don't care if my peers or my
elders are doing the censoring,
no one has the right to make such
a decision. By doing so my rights
are being impinged upon and l
don't think lam the only person
who Wlll not tolerate ihui.

Concerning the film itself, l feel
that the problem was a basic niisv
understanding. Robert Crumb
delinilely did nnl mean in
promote piuludice. His sole pur-
posu us (i liuiiiorisl was to
produce a lunny film that would
dmuki: people laugh AND iliirik
He did not intend to discriminate
against any particular racial or
ethnic group. As for as I can
remunibe: liu also knocked lho
Jewish faith just as hard as he did
uiiy racial group. In my opinion
it's even possible that ilie whole
pom! was to phony
liburuls such as people who show

ridicule

the opinions expressed in Fritz

Wliui disgusts me is llibi in than:

Jusl because: it upsal llium, dousn'
moan they have the right in lry

am reminded of the incident in
Jersey last year. Although the
details of this incidenl slip my
mind what I do recall is that
Eldridge Cleover’s Soul On Ice
was banned from o schoollibrory
and from use in a classroom. ls
this what we are coming lo? Even
though I do not particularly care
for Mr. Cleaver or his book, I cer-
tainly do nol think lhoi that is
reason enough to ban it.

To conclude I think the follow
ing quofe would be appropriate.
Though it perloins to books
meaning and

uyohd that:

“l uni .irioriilied to be told
that, in the Uniled States of

To llic Edilor.

l must take issue with llie letter
about Frilz the Col written by Iris
and Stephanie
appeared in

A la xo rider
Siowori which
lucsdoy's ASP. Yes, lugree with

you this film did illuslruie much of

the evil in our society, expunolly

pruiudico; and yes, it did seem lo
be dirocled against black poor

plu. However, it was done in such
a way that it made lhcsc pro-

iudicos soom ioiolly ridiculous
and absurd. ll exaggerated
lliings so much that l was forced to
laugh at ii. i believe that film was
putting pruwdice down by mak-
ing it so totally absurd and I think
if did u damn good iob. One of
the bust ways i moku a point is to
ovorompliusizo ii and to stretch it
to the point of ridiculousneh. This

suli. “n ‘3‘" in America showed

outrageous preiudices by people
in all walks of life and of all
diifereni races (depicted by
various different animals). When
people can be made to laugh at
something like that and then lhey
stop and think about what if is
they are laughing or, don’t you
think they realize that they are
really laughing of themselves
and their own stupidity? Movies,
like any art form, can’t be taken
at their face value. We have to
figure out, according to our own
preiudices, what the writer
meant. Do you really think he
was trying lo show us how
wonderful it is to be preiudiced?l
don'l.

Secondly, I would like to know
how you can decide that this
movie was an insult to everyone's
inlelligence (as stated in your
letter). Don’t you think that lhove
the right to decide what is and
what is not an insult lo my own in
lelligence? You can't speak for
"everyone." You may speak only

for yourselves.

This sort of brings me to my losl
poinl.Who has the righl-lo screen
films or cartoons and then decide
who! I may or may not see? You
say lhol movies broughl to this
campus should be pro-screened
(basically censored). No one has
0 righl lo decide who! l may or
may not see. lhave a mind. It is up
lo me lo use ii to inierprel lhingsl
see and make my own iudgemeni
about them. No one has the right
to fell mi: tho! I can not see a
movie for any reason, whether it
is conlroversiol or not. Because
something will obviously not
please everyone, is that a reason
to run away from it? I hope not,
because if you) spend YOU' life Yun-
ning from things that aren’t iusl
this way you'd like them, you are
going lo be gobbled up before
you know who' hit you. If you are
going In odvocu‘e censorship of a
harmless thing, like a movie, in a
relatively calm place like a
college campus, I’d hate to think
what you have in mind for the
real world 1984, here we come.
