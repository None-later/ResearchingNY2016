The" Snack Bar
Speaks Out

by Neal Farbor

The Cam-
pus Center Snadi Bar is generally
regarded bySunya students as an
extended joke, on exercise in
poor taste, an elaborate plot
perpetrated by government of-
ficials to undermine or otherwise
destroy the morale and physical

health of the student body, a
natural emetic (0 BLT is by and
large cheaper to purchase than
Ipecac), or perhaps a research
program concluded by the
Physiology Department to deter-
mine just how much strain the
human stomach can actually en‘
dare. l have heard complaints
from students ranging from
band-aids in their milkshakes to
pubic hair in their tunafish
sandwiches, I may be blamed for
the Milkshake Speicals, as the
bandages do occasionally fall
from my lingers as I use the
milkshake machine, although I
will take no credit for the pubic
hair incidents The fact remains,
however, that the snack bar is a
much-frequented place and is un-
doubtedly crowded after classes
break, on week-ends,after
movies or concerts let out, and es-
pecially during the first couple of
weeks of the new semester.
Ordering from the snack bar can
be particularly chaotic during a
"rush." As a matter of fact, Liz
MacFarland, the High Priestess of
Hamburgers, was supposed to
have taught CRP 202, "The
Proper Way to Order at the
Snack Bar Without Giving the
Workers any Unnecessary ’Tsurris'
"; however, she was not granted
tenure because she destroyed
and burned Deon Hunsberger's
grilled cheese to a crisp. So, as a
public service, a list of “helpful
hints" has been compiled; For the
benefit of both the customer and
the FSA worker, please
familiarize youself with and
follow these suggestions:

l. When ordering drinks from
the soda fountain, STATE with
your order, "ICE" or “NO ICE"
and "SMALL" or "LARGE."

2. When ordering from the
sandwich board, remember that
sandwiches are made on white,
rye. whole wheat, or hard roll (5d
extra), and that all sandwiches
lettuce and
mayonnaise, unless the worker is

are made with

specifically told otherwise, It
saves
preference rather than having
the worker ask you.

3. When ordering from the grill,
STATE whether you want the
hamburger or fronkfurter roll
toasted, whether you wont let-
tuco or tomato or mayonnaise
with your order lMMEDlATELY
when you order, NOT after it has
already been made.

4. Orders cannot be made “to
go" behind the counter. Plastic
bags or brown paper bags may
be obtained from the cashier.

time if you state your

5. Familiarize yourself with the
snack bar hours

Monday - Thursday 10 a.m.- “p.m.

Friday. W cm.» l2 midnight

Saturday 9 am. - l2 mid night

Sunday 2 pm - ll p.m.

Dont’ be disappointed: The grill
and sandwich board closes,
without exception, 'lz-hour before
closing. The soda fountain and
sub bar remain open.

6. One very impartant thing to
remember is that when ordering
please speokd LOUDLY and
CLEARLY and DlSTlNCTLY. ft is
often quite difficult to understand
what customers are ordering.

7. Coffee, tea, hot chocolate,
and milk are self-service
operations.

8. The Beer Bar is NOT self-
service. Please ask one of the
workers to assist your
9. One may find the following
items at the cashier counter:
knives, forks, spoons, napkins,
coffee stirrers, sugar, salt,
pepper, plastic or paper bags,
and lids for soda cups. Remind
the cashier if these items are run-
ning low.

10. To help the cashier: hand
dollar bills to the cashier flat, not
crumpled up or folded; be aware
that items over 10c are Subied to
7% sales tax; be aware that
prices are subject to change.

ll. Probably most important isto
help allnviate the Garbage
Situation, The snack bar could be
run more efficiently if there were
more workers behind the counter
and less workers cleaning up
after the customers. PLEASE”
EMPTY YOUR TRA/S IN THE
TRASH CANS LOCATED
THROUGHOUT THE
RATHSKELLARH It takes so little
effort - you inevitably pass by a
trash can as you leave the
Rathskellar. Tell a worker if the
trash cans are full so he can emp-
ty the can and put in a new liner.
Please keep the condiment
counter, the soda fountain area,
and the grill area clean. ft is real-
ly unnecessary to leave straw
wrappers, crumpled napkins,
used teabogs, unused cups, emp-
ty sugar or Sanka packets strewn
all over the counter

l2. Become familiar with the
different snack bar stations, and
order what you want from that
particular station, it there is a
large crowd, tl cannot be ex»
pocted that a person making
hamburgers can drop everything
and run over to the fountain to
get a customer a Coke.

Seriously, though, I have
written this article with the hope
that service can be improved,
and with the intention that

operations can be maintained

our work hat states "Our Job is

meant lacetiously, I must
emphasize the word "SERVE",
We workers do not determine the
price of food, the hours the snack
bar is open or what is being
offered. Our job is to serve and
wait on our customers. And
believe me, for every customer
that gives us grief, there are one
hundred others that are friendly,
outgoing, patient, and un-

Redford as "The Candidate’

To prepare for the title
role in his newest film.
“The Candidate.“
presented by SUNY
Cinema on Friday,
September 14. Robert
Redford spent a great deal
01' time researching old
magazines and film clips
in order to recreate how a.
realvlife U.S. senatorial
candidate looks and
dresses. Director Michael
Ritchie and a team 01'
professional political
party men sought to
achieve visual credibility
to match the authenticity
of the original script by
Jeremy burner. who was a
spccchwritcr for Eugene
McCarthy during the 1968
presidential campaign.

Ordinarily. a star is in-
sulated from the public by
studio guards and his per-
sonal en wuruge. but Red-
ford insisted on being in»
valved in everything dur-
ing location shooting. "It
made the picture more

realistic this way," Red-
ford said. “We went to real
political rallies we shot
all three rings of the
political circus. and I
hope we can show our
audiences what a
senatorial race really
looks and sounds like
from the inside 

"The Candidate" is the
story 01' an idealistic
lawyer who is seduced
into u. big-time political
race. and who gradually
finds himself torn
between his ambition and
his conscience. A
Redford-Ritchie produc-
tion for Warner Bros. it
was directed by Michael
ltitchie and produced by
Walter Coblcnz. Starring
with Redford are Peter
Boyle as his campaign
manager and Melvyn
Douglas as his father. Ca-
stzu‘ring are Don l’m'tci'.
Allen Garfield and Karen
Carlson.
