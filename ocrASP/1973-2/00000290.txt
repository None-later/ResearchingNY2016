campus, off-campus. uptown. downtown people
(always we emphasize our differences.) no doubt any
and all of these factors are important. but as we begin
this fall 1973 at sunya. let us remember that what we
have .in common is even more important than our dis-
parities. for when we dismiss them all and get down to
the nitty, we still have one thing in common our
beautiful BLACKNESS. can u dig it? with this attitude
and a positive assertion of our talents “umoja” will be a
feeling we share rather than just a word we hear.

together black people. come together and work with the
brothers and sisters working for us on campus. come
together and support the efforts ofour people in the com-
munities. come together and build with black students
on other campuses. and above all. black people, let‘s get
the academic education we need to make the years we
have before us productive years.

Music from Distant Corners

by Kevin Owen

By far the most exciting
music that I have heard in
many months comes not
from the studios of Lon-
don or Los Angeles. but
from tiny villages
scattered throughout the
world. presented by Non-
esuch Records in theirEx-
plorer series. An album
entitled “The Nonesuch
Explorer: Music from
Distant Corners of the
World (a. two-record set
which. incidentally. sells
for $2.29. a far cry from
what one usually pays for
an album these days)
serves as an excellent in-
troduction to this
treasury of the world's
music.

Side one. "The Far
East". presents music
from Bali. Java and
Japan. It opens with the
Ramayana Monkey
Chant. an astounding
vocal piece performed by
a chorus of over 200 men
as part of a religious
ritual. Next we are treated
to examples of Balinese
and Javanese “gamelan”.
a musical form whose
weirr‘. subtle rhythms
have influenced such 20th
century composers as
Elliot Carter. The sampl-
ing of Japanese music in—
troduces such classical
instruments as the shaku-
hachi. an end-blown flute.

 The Truth About Gershwin

The "public" Gershwin
and the "true" Gershwin
are not one and the same
as the soon—to-be—released
b'ook Gershwin: His Life
and Music by Charles
Schwartz. reveals. The
75th anniversary of Ger~
shwin's birth is being
widely celebrated begin-
ning September 26. and
there are many aspects of
his life and work that are
practically unknown
quantities even at this
late date. several decades
after his death in 1937, As
a result of stories
repeated over the years
about America‘s most
famous composer. an im»
age of Gershwin. as man
and musician. has been
established as a
“definitive” one. though it
is far from the case as the
biography by Mr.
Schwartz shows.

M r Schwartz's
Gershwin. with an in-
troduction by Leonard
Bernstein. has avoided
the pitfalls of taking at

face value the cardboard-
l‘acade image of George
Gershwin. as propagated
by press agentry as well
as by the composers
friends or those of his
family. Instead. the
author. while tracing Ger—
shwin's life from his
childhood through his
evolution as a composer
of Broadway and
Hollywood musicals and
symphonic and operatic
works. has dug beneath
the surface and has come
up with facts to substan-
tiate his conclusrons, 1n—
cludirlg information
about controversial and
hidden events. Whether
proving that the famous
opening clarinet glissan-
do of the Rhapsody in
Blue was not Gershwin‘s,
or that the composer was
assisted in the orchestral
realization of lllS
symphonic works and his
opera Porgy and Hess by
Joseph Schillinger and
others. the author has
relied on facts rather than

fiction.

Many myths
Gershwin's per—
intelligence.
musicianship, and
prowess with the ladies
are laid to rest. Also ex-
plored are Gershwin's
tremendouscareerdrives,
his compulsive yet
unsuccessful

study with
name musicians. his psy-
chological problems. his
frequenting Of brothels.
and his relations with
women and his family.

The claim by Alan Ger-
shwin. that he is the com-
poser's illegitimate son is
candidly and openly dis-
cussed too.

The author of Gershwin
is uniquely qualified to
write about George Ger-
shwin. As composer. im-
presario. music director 0
Composers' Showcase,
music professor. and
former jazz musician,
Charles Schwartz has had
a long acquaintance with
George Gershwin‘s work.

and the koto. the familiar
Japanese zither. In addi-
tion there are the sounds
of the Kabuki theatre and
the folk melodies of the
Flower Dance.

For those of us who
thought that Indian music
began and ended with
Ravi Shankar. side two
may provide a few sur-
prises. From the classical
expressions of such in—
struments as the sarangi
and vina to the street
minstrel music of the
Bauls of Bengal is quite a
journey. The music is
often complex. butalways
fascinating. The ex-
perience of classical In-
dian vocal music is atfirst
shocking. so unlike
anything in the Western
tradition is it, but ourears
quickly adjust, we are
overwhelmed by the
virtuosity of the perfor—
mance.

Sides three and four
return us to the somewhat
more familiar territory of
the Western Hemisphere.
A steel band from
Trinidad and a panpipe
ensemble from the high
sierrar of Peru highlight

side three, which also
features music from
Rhodesia. Mexico. and the
Bahamas. The final side
opens with excerpts from
“Music of Bulgaria”, one
of the better known
albums in the Explorer
Series. The music is a
fast—paced energetic
whirlwind performed by
the Naitonal Ensemble of
Bulgaria. Also here is
village music of
Yugoslavia. which offers
a duet on djura. and zurla.
double reed instruments
which are related to the
oboe. Bouzoukee from
Greece and folk fiddling
from Sweden round out
the album.

The music on these
albums is captivating and
immediately accessible.
The influence of much ofit
on people such as Frank
Zappa and the Incredible
String Band is striking.
The albums themselves
are well recorded. inex—
pensive and contain ex-
cellent explanatory notes
about the music and the
instruments on which itis
performed. For a truly un-
ique musical experience I
highly recommend the
NoneSuch Explorer
Series.
