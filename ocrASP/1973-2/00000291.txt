.Wlio is Charlie Kaplan?

By the year 1918.
Charles Chaplin had been
in movies for four years,
had turned,out over fifty
short comedies. and had
become the best known
personality in theworld
His popularity had. in
fact, reached manic
proportions. His earlier
films were being con-
tinually re-edited and
released as new produc-
tions and any number of
imitators with such
blatantly deceptive
screen names as Charles
Aplin and Charlie Kaplin
attempted to cash in on
the public's insatiable
appetite for the vision of
the little tramp with the
bowler hat and oversized
shoes.

Chaplin had become
more than the funniest
comedian in the then
short history of the
movies. His screen

character had become the
universal symbol of the
little man doing battle
with the Establishment.
The Establishment may
be represented by nothing
more elaborate than the
cop on the corner or an in-
timidating waiter in a
cheap restaurant. But the
mass audience un-
derstood what it meant;
they had been there. And
in the mute figure of the
little tramp they found
their voice.

The essence of the
Chaplin ofthis period is to
be found in A Dog’s Life.
Here is the famous
Charlie character, seedy
in appear ance yet
fastidious in demeanor:
the whole world seeming-
ly against him yet ever
th e d r e a m e r a n d
dauntless optimist.

Shoulder Arms.

first major Chaplin
classic. was produced
during World War I and
released shortly before
the armistice. The idea of
a comedy about war and
soldiering was con-
sidered a daring risk at
the time, but audiences
including the allied
soldiers to whom it was
shown in the trenches
loved it. ShoulderArms is
the original of the whole
genre of service comedies
which continues by way
of Catch-22 and
M.A.S.H.

The Pilgrim was
Chaplin‘s first
wholehearted venture
into the realm of satire.
The object here is small
town America, its Puritan
mores and accompanying
hypocrisy. Chaplin‘s por-
trayal of a bogus minister
managed to upset a. few
people at the time The
Pilgrim bears the rather
odd distinction of having
been banned throughout
the state ofPennsylvania.

These three short films.
which together run a total
of nearly two hours. were
joined together by
Chaplin for European re-
release in 1958. It was at
this time that Chaplin
compiled the brief
prologue and composed
the score which accom-
[iitliy this presentation.

In preparing A Dog‘s
Info illld Shoulrlur Arms
for release With sound. it
was necessary to subject
both films to a process
