‘ Columbia:

CPS Five years ago last:

grievances against Colum-

of building occupations and
demonstrations un—
paralleled in the history of
American universities.

nationwide attention on stu-
dent problems. goals. and

Warned that the trustees
would not countenance any
interference in the name of
social activism. the Senate
reversed a decision to recom-
mend that. the trustees cost

consumer-advocate
proposals at. corporate
meetings.

In the face of increasing

ticipetion in boards of

Any potential for larger
concerns seems benumbed
by a. combination of
pressures for grades. as
reasonable supply of dope.
and co-ed dorm life. Com-
mentators compare the con-
temporary scene to the im-
age of the apolitical and
sucess-oriented '505.

Yet Columbia University

costs. inflation. and tuition
spiral ever upwards.
