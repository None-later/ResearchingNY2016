g WorkersgProtest Death to Hundreds in Chilean Coup

South African police shot
and killed 12 black workers
during a labor riot in a gold
mine near Johannesburg.

The incident that ended
Wednesday was the most
serious black-white confron-
tation under South Africa‘s
apartheid regime since the
1960 Sharpeville shooting.

Another 27 Africans were
reported injured. 2 seriously.
and t policeman was hurt.
Officials confirmed the 12
dead had been shot. Earlier
reports said one African
worker had been hacked to
death by fellow workers.The
shooting brought a drop in
South African gold shares in
London and prices on the
Johannesburg exchange fell
across the board after a
selloff in the gold section
spread to other industrials.

Brokers said the market
followed a pattern set by the
stock exchanges after the
Sharpeville massacre in
which 67 Africans were
killed and dozens wounded
13 years ago,The riotingbroke
outTuesday afternoon at one
of South Africa's most
modern mines. the Western
Deep Levels. owned by
Anglo-American Corp.

The disturbance. said to
have involved many of the
1.000 machine operators.
climaxed a. week-old pay and

job classification dispute.

Mine manager Algy von
Holdt told newsmen Wednes-
day that some 75 to 100
workers. whose demands
had been turned down. tried
to prevent others from repor-
ting for the night shift.

Police were called in when
workers stoned white mine
officials.

Von Holdt said the crowd
grew bigger and the 20 police
then on the scene tried to
break them up with tear gas
and a baton charge.

When the blacks began set-
ting some buildings afire and
looting others. Von Holdt
said. police reinforcements
were called from surroun-
ding towns. A senior police
official said his men opened
fire only when the rioters had
gone "absolutely berserk".

Von Holdt said the distur-
bances were over by 2 a.m.
Wednesday and the morning
shift reported for work as
usual.

Facilities for Western Deep
Level's tens of thousands of
Workers are considered
above average by standards
here. It is also one of the
wealthiest mines in the
world. Last year it made a
profit of $68.9 million and
paid $29.8 million in divi-
dends.

SANTIAGO, Chile AP -
The new military junta
buried Salvator Allende on
Wednesday and warned arm—
ed supporters of the dead
Marxist president that they
would be “shot on the spot if
taken prisoner."

Scattered resistance to the
regime continues and unof—
ficial sources estimated that
between 500 and 1.000 per-
sons had been killed since
the military revolt Tuesday.
Explosions were heard in

some industrial
neighborhoods and snipers.

buildings. exchanged fire

dred leftists surrendered

said. In another brief skir—
mish. soldiers moved in and
occupied the large state-
owned textile factory in the
capital.

Officials said the new
government expelled 150
Cuban extremists from the
country Tuesday. They were
escorted to the Argentine
border.

Firm estimates of
casualties were impossible
to obtain since no movement
was permitted in the city and
no official figures were
issued.

Many people have been
stranded ever since the coup
in office buildings and hotels
. not allowed to return to
their homes or to go out for

food and drink. All
businesses were colsed and
the streets were empty of
civilians.

There were conflicting
reports on the whereabouts
of Allende's widow. who was
believed to have returned
recently from Mexico where
she took part in relief work.

Washington Denies

Involvement

WASHINGTON AP - Amid
official denials of US. in-
volvement in Chile‘s
military coup. the State
Department Wednesday
appeared disposed to hide its
time before making contact
with the new government
leadership in Santiago.

The sensitivity of
Washington‘s relationship
with the new military junta
was underscored by charges
from leftist groups here and
in Latin America that the
responsibility for Tuesday's
ouster of President Salvador
Allende lay not in Santiago
but in Washington.

Demonstrations with anti-
American overtones were
reported in Argentina. Mex-
ico and Costa Rica. among
other countries. in
Washington. 150
demonstrators gathered near
the White House bearing

placards saying. “Let Chile‘s

State Department
spokesman Paul Hare said
the coup was a Chilean
“internal matter" and that no
elements of the US.
governemnt were involved.

Based on past experience.
State Department officials
said it was not surprising
that the US. was accused of
complicity in the takeover.

It was understood that
Washington would allow
several other governments
to recognize the junta before
it makes it‘s move.

Prior to recognizing a new
government. the State
Department normally deter-
mines whether the regime in—

national obligations and [S in

reports of widespread
resistance in Chile to the new
leadership raised questions
about its Capacrty to govern.

Assuming the junta is able
to consolidate its power.
there was little doubt that
relations between the two
countries would Improve.

Public Watergate Hearings to Resume

by Michael Putzel
Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON AP - Seek-
ing to wrap up its probe
quickly, the Senate
Watergate committee
Wednesday voted un-
animously to resume public
hearings Sept. 24 and
attempt to complete them by
Nov. 1.

Chairman Sam J. Ervin. D-
N.C.. said the panel would
“expedite the proceedings by
hearing witnesses with high-
ly relevant testimony“ only.
He said the committee was
"not responding at all to
pressure“ to keep the
hearings from public View.
Committee aides were quick
to note that Nov. 1 is only it
target date and suggested
that the committee won‘t
stick to it if it uncovers
dramatic new infor-
mations and
financing in the 1972
presidential race. 'l'hUSB
matters will come under
scrutiny when the panel

campaign

completes the Watergate
phase of its investigation.
There is little question that
committee senators have
lost their taste for the long
and detailed examination of
the type they conducted into
the Watergate break-in and
White House cover-up.
Before summer recess. they
operated on a five~day week—
ly schedule of hearings: in
the last six weeks of
hearings. they hope to meet
three days a week.

Committee sources gave
various explanations. Sen.

Colson Dropped
As Witness

WASHINGTON AP
Former presidentiaICounsel

dropped as a witness before
the Senate Watergate com-
mittee after his lawyer said
Colson expected to be m-
dicted by a federal grand

Once the Watergate figure

Shapiro apparently was
informed of Colson's status
by the office of Watergate
special prosecutor
Archibald Cox. which also is
probing the lﬂllsbcrg

returned four indictments ill
the case last week.

Wednesday. “that's their

not to. I would not be disap-

when they resume. The CBS

Uncertain

'l‘hc NBC 'l‘elevision
