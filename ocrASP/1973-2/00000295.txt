The long hot summer is

, almost over.- Sunday the pro

football season begins and the
weeks of preparation end. Now
it is all for keeps.

The NFC East has had a team
in the last three Super Bowls and
if the pattern continues. they
should have it again.

Washington. last year‘s
runnerup. has not stood pat.
They acquired Duane Thomas to
go along with super back Larry
Brown. They also have a great
blocking back in Charlie
Harraway.

At quarterback Washington
has the problem of who to play,
Sonny Jurgenson a fine passer
or Bill Kilmer. the man who led
them to the Super Bowl?

Defense has always been
Allen's specialty and the addi-
tion of All-Pro Dave Robinson
can't hurt. If there is a Weakness.
ti is at middle linebacker. butthe
rest of the team is solid.

Dallas. the ex-Super Bowl
champs never have a bad team
but this one may not be a good as
some of the others. They too
have two capable leaders. But
neither Roger Staubach nor
Craig Morton has proven that
they can do the job for the full
fourteen games.

Walt Garrison and Calvin Hill
are back but the depth is now
missing. Lance Alworth and
Ron Sellers are gone and Bob
Hayes clashes with Coach Tom
Landry.

Also gone is the heart and
spirit of the defense Chuck
Howley. His replacement D. D.
Lewis may be good buthe doesn‘t
have Howley's knack for being
in the right place at the right
time. Injuries have affected Bob
Lily and he will notlongerbe the
super tackle he once was.

The once great Giants are hop-
ing to elevate themselves back to
the prominance they shared in
the early Sixties. The offense is
back with the NFC t l passer.
Norm Snead. Randy Johnson is
almost as good and though un-
happy with it. he claims he is
willingtoaccept it. Ron Johnson
is a great back but needs the
super blocker in Charlie Evans
to help.

Bob Tucker and Bob Grim lead
a deep corps of receivers to go
with an improving offensive
line.

Jack Gregory loads a more
than adequate front four which

is backed up by an equally deep
squad, of linebackers. Draft
choices, such as Rich Glover and
Brad Van Pelt will probably sit
with Glover struggling to even
make the squad.

The secondary is where im-
provement is needed and it has
looked solid in training camp.
The Giants will go only as far as
their defense will take them.

The Eagles have a quarterback
now in Roman Gabriel.but their
big receiver Harold Jackson is
gone. The running game is
nothing to get excited about and
Tom Dempsey will probably be
the offensive threat with his foot.

The defense is young. inex-
perienced and poor enough that
Gabriel will never have a safe
lead to play with.

St. Louis is rebuilding but
their number one draft choice
has not signed. They will try to
win with Quarterback Jim Hart.
who is nothing to build a
franchise on. Donny Anderson's
vast talents will be lost on a los-
ing team. The once mighty
defense has lost Larry Wilson. a
legitimate super star.

The Central Division has
always been a rugged one due
mainly to its location. Last
year‘s Winners were the young
Green Bay Packers. Led by the
powerful running of John
Brockington and McArthur
Lane. They surprisingly won
their division.

Scott Hunter. a young quarter-
back. was good enough along
with Bart Starr's coaching to get
into field goal position for
Chester Marco].

One would expect this team to
get better with time especially
with an ex-college coach who
needs time to adjust to the pros.
but in their case it may not be
proven out. Bart Starr is gone
and Hunter who is fighting for
his job with Jerry 'l‘agge will be
on his own.

The defense has lost both Dave
Robinson and Ray Nistchke.
The Packer‘s fortunes are all
dependent upon the offense and
specifically the quarterback.

The Vikings had one of their
worst years last year but if the
pre-season is any indication
things have changed. Fran
Tarkenton looks like he found
the combination to lead an
offense which may have an out-
side running threat. for the first
time in years with rookie Chuck
Foreman.

 

 

 

PAGE lrIlGi*i'I'EEN

 

  

The defense. though getting
old. is still one of the best..lf'the

toffense can give them some

breathers and they can stay
away from injuries they still
should do the job for the Vikings.
Fred Cox must also regain the
form of two years ago for the
Vikings to go all the way.

Detroit has a new coach in Don
McCafferty. a new defense and a
new play. Conservatism is now
replaced and no job is
guaranteed. Quarterbacks Greg
Landry and Bill Munson has
been able to move the team well
but the starting job is still up in
the air. The backfield. if healthy.
contains three top runners in
Steve Owens. Altie Taylor and
Mel Farr.

The defense. led by Lem
Barney. have looked good so far.
But it doesn't seem to be cham-
pionship material and is
definitely not deep.

Chicago is having a fine
summer but how can you win
with a quarterback who only
completes 87% Bobby Douglas
can run but he can‘t pass. Carl
Garret is a super runner but the
lack of passing won‘t help him.

The defense is still led by Dick
Butkus. and little slower but
still as mean. The rest of itis an
unknown quality and not cham-
pionship material.

The 49ers unlike most teams
will have to use the pass to setup
the run. The runners are less
than adequate but with passers
such as John Brodie and Steve
Spurrier and receivers like Geno
Washington and Ted Kwulick.
the pass will be the thing. The
strong defense should help the
49ers take the weak western
division.

The Falcons have been touted
the last few years as the team to
upset SF. Without a proven
quarterback. the road will be a
tough one. Dick Shiner. Bob Lee
and Pat Sullivan are all can—
didates with Sulliavan seeming
to have the inside track. The run-
ning game. led by Art Malone
and Dave Hampton is great but
not enough to counteract the
weakness at quarterback.

The defense is tough with John
Zack and Claude i-iumphroys
along with Tommy Nobis in the
middle.

L.A. has u new quarterback in
John Hadl and a new and in
ilarold Jackson. The running
game is barely adequate. with
Larry Smith the big gun.

 "  Pro V other: Start Pldflllff  keel" Sunday

The defense will have three or
four rookies and except for the
Olsen Brothers. an inferior pass
rush. If L.S. is going to go
somewhere every rookie will
have to come through.

New Orleans is going to have a
super dome next year but itwill
be a real long time before they
have a super team. Archie Man-
ning is an improving quarter-
back but he misses many games
due to counteless injuries. Ball
players come and go and none
stay around long enough. The
defense is porous. the offense in—
consistent.

There are player problems but
managerial ones as well.

So there‘s the N.F.C. and here‘s
my picks; it will be Washington.
Minnesota and San Francisco.
The wildcard? New York.

The A.F.C. is led by undefeated
Miami. They still hve a. regular
season streat going and are out
to get the record of 17 in a row.
There have been very few
changes. The running backs.
Kiick. Morris and Cszonka are
all back along with quarter
backs. Bob Griese and Earl
Morrall.

The “no-name defense" has
gotten the name and again will
be back together. One thing is
pretty safe though. they will lose
at least once this year.

The New York Jets have a
healthy Joe Namath this year. if
he can stay away from the in-
terception he will put points on
the board. John Higgins still
hasn’t decided whether he will
play or not but. Boozer has and
along with Jim Nance gives
them a respectable backfield.

The defense has been
remodeled with Larry Grantham
retired and Gerry Philben hav-
ing been traded. Charlie Winner.
who will take over the coaching
job next year. has instilled anew
defense and I41 draft pick
Burgess Owens has improved it.
Weakness may be at linebacker
due to Grantham departure and
Al Atkinson‘s so-so exhibition
play.

The Colts have a remodel team
and a young one. Marty Domros
is statistically a good quarter-
back. whothor he can lead the
club is a question. Lydoll
Mitchell. Don Nottingham and
Dick McCaulcy are the bucks
and arr: all young.

liuffulo sooner or later in go-
ing to hch a good team, as they
got enough high draft (:llUICOB.

With OJ. Simpson they have a
good running attack. Veteran
quarterback. Dennis Shaw and
rookie Joe Fergusen can both
throw but mistakes cost them
clearly. The offense can't play
defense and neither can the
defense. Until that can stop
somebody. Buffalo won‘t go
anywhere.

New England has a solid
quarterback in Jim Plunkett
despite last year's statistics.
What running attack they had
went to Chicago with Carl Gar-
rett. The defense is as bad as Buf-
falo's. New coach Chick Fair-
banks deserves better.

The central Division has
always been called the weakest
but this could change this year.
Pittsburgh stood pay feeling

whole crew is back. Bradshaw.
Hanratty. Harris. Fuqua and

Pittsburgh faces one of the
toughest schedules going and

almost every game.

Kori Stablcr and George Blandu

Guys More Tomorrow '

by David Levy
One of this country‘s most

popular participant sports

and. as evidenced by the tur-
nout at Forest Hills last
week. increasingly popular
spectator events is Tennis. A
great deal of attention has
been paid to the exploits of
the touring professionals as
well as that inimitable
hustler. Mr. Riggs. What
should be realized is that
before joining the lucrative
professional circuit. the vast
majority of players
graduated from the
collegiate ranks. One of the
year's biggest surprises.
Sandy Mayer. is still com-
peting in intercollegiate
play.

S.U.N.Y atAlbany hasa
team. Although they are no
threat to Stanford‘s title. the
squad is a definite contender
for the crown at the S UNYAC
Tournament which deter»
mines the champion of all the
state schools, Coming off a
fine 8 - 3 season in ‘72-'73 in
which they placed second
only to Oneontu in the
SUNYAC moot. Couch
Robert Lewis has compiled
an impressive group of
returnees to comprise the
fall squad, The season is
broken in half. with some
matches being played in the
fall and the remainder dur-
ing the spring. Although
graduation has taken away
last. year's top three men.
Coach Lcwis does not appear
bothered as he feels that he
now has n more consistent

carry them through an ex—
cellent. your. it should be
noted that in the two
