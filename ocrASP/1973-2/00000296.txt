 

Batme

by Kenneth Arduino

Chalk one'up for Siena. The
annual Albany-Siena
rivalry started this Wednes-
day when two undefeated
baseball teams met. Siena
outlasted the Danes 7-5 in 10
innings.

Albany, now 2-1 had to bat-
tle back to stay in the game.
Two runs in the last of the
eighth put Albany back in a
tie. .Vic Giulianelli. the
Albany hitting star. came up
with his third hit. a triple.
With two out it looked like
Vic would be stranded but
Tom Blair singled in a run.
stole second. and scored on a
Slave Deforest double.

Siena won it in the tenth on
a single. a stolen base.
another single and the se-
cond baseman throwing the

ball away. a single to short
and the shortstop throwing
the ball away.

Starting for Albany was
Roy Slutsky. Roy. a hard
thrower. was able to get out
of jams with his speed. but
four walks and four wild
pitches proved to be his un-
doing.

One apparent weakness
that Albany showed was
defensively at catcher. Siena
had six steals without being
thrown out. Albany pitchers
also had six or seven wild
pitches which might have
been blocked by a more ex-
perienced catcher. Vic
Giulianelli played rightfield
most of last year and needs
experience. Albany pitchers
could help out by watching
the runners a little more
closely.

Not everything was bleak.
Guilianelli's hitting was ex-
ceptional. Steve DeF‘orest
clutch hit, Terry Kenney's
two great throws from
centerfield and Steve
Devito‘s scoreless relief
pitching.

Another important thing
was the spirit of the club.
They never gave up despite
the fact they didn't score
between the third and eighth.
Their comeback shows a lot
of class. Siena is no push-
over. and their pitcher Dick
Wood was outstanding. strik-
ing out 12. It was no disgrace
to lose this hard fought
game.

The Batmen new travel to
Potsdam Saturday for their
first SUNYAC game.

Boaters Optimistic

by Nathan Salant
Impressive! That was the
feeling which was predomi-
nant on the soccer sidelines
and. wonder of wonders. the
fans were "impressed" by the
Albany Great Dane Booters.
and not the competition.

You remember the hooters.
don't you? You know: great
exhibition season. 1-13
regular season,“seven fans
attend". "booters kicked
twice." less than thirty goals
in a season..."

But wait. What's this?
Final score: Albany 5. Sons
of italy 4. Final score:
Albany 3.5 - Marist2.0. Final
score: Albany 9. HVCC 2.
True. the Danes were
winners during last season's
exhibitions. but they totaled
a mere 11 goals in 8games as
opposed to 22 in four this
year. Could things be
changing? What's the
story?

Ask Coach Schiei'felin and
he'll tell you the story. begin-
ning with the recruiting of
such high school stars as
Arthur Bedford and Wayne
Garroway. Next. you will
hear about the new balance
on this team: "Every player
has played at least two
positions in our exhibition
games this year. We have
depth this year. something
we never dreamed of last
season. Players. who would
have started on last year's
varsity. are filling the JV
ranks this year."

Remember how those
breaks always went against
the Danes last year? What
about this year Coach? "This
year we are making our own
breaks. Last season we
scored 1! we were lucky. This
year we are forcing the
breaks in our favor."

Let's take a look at the pre-
season games: The Sons of
ltaly came to town last week.
and ran into "some specy.
spicey meatball" as the
hooters scored 5 goals in the
first half. and sent the JV in
to hold the lead.

At Marist this past Satur-
day. the footmen pulled off
the first come from behind
victory anyone can
remember. Down 1-0
and 2-1. the hooters rallied to
dominate the second half.
with newcomers Jose Ruano
and Bob Schliggel tallying
for a Dane win.

The second round saw the
Danes blast Marist off the
field. 5—0. Hector Martinez.
Leroy Aldridge. Wayne Gar-
roway. Jerry Garlick. and
Emerich Browmarck all
scored. and Arthur Bedl’ord
ta member of the AllWestln—
dies High School Team of 72—
73) had 3 assists. 'l‘he Danes
were so effective that Coach
Schieffeiin could remember
no more than 5 Marist shots
in the game.

However. the big win was
on Monday. when HVCC. a
team which has always
found the holes in the Dane
defense. came to town. As
many expected. iiVCC broke
on top witliaquick.although
somewhat cheap. floating
kick into the net. Suddenly.
the Danes amazed everyone
by rattling off five straight
goals before HVCC was to
score again. and the game
ended as a rout.

An obviously pleased
Coach Schleffelin praised
the passwork of his young
team. and pain ted out that the
Danes has put 22 goals into
the scorebcok in a mere four
games.

Coach Schieffelin also
emphasized that these teams
are not on the quality level of
the SUNYAC teams the
Danes will face this year. as
the only team which ap-
proached the level of play of
the weaker SUNYAC squads
was HVCC. However. these
teams are also the ones you
must beat if you want to
dream of a 500+ season.

Personally. I believe that
this Saturday's traditional
Quadrangular meet with
Colgate. Queens. and
Williams will give a truly
concrete indicator ofthe type
of season the fans can expect
from the hooters. Apparent—
ly, Coach Schieffelin agrees:
"We'll see our first top notch
competition. and we‘ll know
where we stand after we have
gone up against thosetcams."

As for a first string, or
“starting team,“ there is
none. Everyone will play.
thanks to the new talent. and
much larger squad which
allows for more sub-
stitutions. Obwald appears
to be the strongest competi—
tion for the goalie slot. with
the fullback. halfback. and
front line still very much up
in the air due to the ability of
so many players to play
several positions. book for
Obwald in the net. Solano.
Aldridge. Schliggel. and
Cobanc in the fullback spots:
Rolando. Rovito. and Bed»
ford at halfbacks. and Car-
roway. Walzcr. and Ruano or
Sedefian up front.

So far. so good for the
hooters. Unfortunately. I
cannot help remembering
that the hooters have been
here before. Yes. they do
have the talent. but as
Scheiffelin point. blankly
states. "we'll have to go out
and prove ourselves.“ The
Quadrangular will tell a lot.
but Wednesday's opener ver-
sus RPI will tell it all!

inside the Danes

by Bill Heller
How the Wishbone Works

Although spectacular to

watch. the wishbone attack

often confuses the average

fan. simply because a lot of

people don‘t understand how

it works.

There are eight basic plays
to Albany's offense. each of
which can be run to either
side. The most important is
the inside veer used roughly
fifty percent of the game.
More commonly known as
the triple-option. it provides
three distinct possibilities
and many headaches for the
defense.

The inside veer. as all of
Albany's plays. starts from a
full backfield (quarterback.
two halfbacks. and fullback).
in the first phase of the play.
the quarterback "rides" the
fullback. to the line. while the
two halfbacks swing to the
outside. Here the quarter-
back has his first option. to
hand off to the fullback or
not. He bases his decision on
a defensive key. one of the
two unblocked defenders. If
this first key swings out. the
fullback gets it: if he plugs
the hole. the quarterback
keeps it.

Now the quarterback reads
the second key. the other un-
blocked defensive man. lfthe
key closes on him. he pitches
to one halfback while the
other halfback blocks. lithe
key closes on the halfback
the quarterback keeps it.
Now, isn‘t that simple?

Similar to the inside veer
is the outside veer. which is
the same play but run one
hole further to the outside.
Here the fullback goes to the
hole outside the tackle,

wherein the inside veer it‘s
the hole between the tackle
and guard.

The most effective way to
stop the triple-option is to
have the defense flow with
the direction or the Veer and
wait to react. rather than at-
tacking the offense. When
they do that though. they're
open to three more Albany
plays: the counter. the belly.
and the counter-option.

in the counter. the halfback
that normally blocks for the
veer gets the ball and goes
against the direction of the
veer. When the defense waits
to react. the quarterback
might call the belly. This is a
power blocking play. where
the halfback gets the hand off
and follows the fullback
through the hole. 'l'here's
also the counter-option.
where the quarterback fakes
the counter and either keeps
or pitches.

The other basic running
play is the fullback dive. a
simple hand off with no fake.
If you‘re not totally confused
by now. I'll try harder.

Although not conducive to
a great aerial attack. the
Wishbone does present oc-
casional opportunities for
the big pass. This comes
about because the defense is
forced to single—cover the
split end and is always
worrying about the triple-
option. At times. the op—
posing secondary will come
too close to the line ofscrim-
inuge (to stop the veer) and
leave itself wide open for the
bomb.

You can see the Danes test
out the wishbone tomorrow
morning at 10:80 as Albany
scriinmages against Hudson
Valley.
