Order of the Veiled Prophet. a
group of about I.000 white
men. He was then arrested
when he took the further step of
lying in front of the UM hand

of his views on a subject which
he determined to be of public
importance." Nevertheless, the

Alumni Laws
Under Revision

At a recent candidates‘ meeting
on Alumni Quad. students were in-
formed that there would bc a
referendum on the ballot down-
town. along with the names ofcan-
didates running for office. Reac-
tion ranged from “What the hell is
a referendum?" to “ How cart I vote
Ior' something I don't know
anything about?" to “Who are the
elitists \tho write referendums
without asking me to help them?“
:\s a result. this article is being
\\ rtlten to explain What the Alttrtt-

is important.

The fear was voiced at the can-
didates‘ meeting that, with so little
publicity. the referendum on the
constitution would be defeated. If
this happens. Alumni Quad‘s 52.-
|Xt).i)0 budget \tould remain
l'rolen. as it is now pending accep-
tance of the constitution. Ad-
ditionally. without a constitution.
Alumni would not be permitted to
have a quad board. There would be
