The junta that toppled Salvador
Allende reported Sunday that ann-
ed civilians were still resisting
military authorities and warned
they will be killed unless they lay
down their weapons.

At least three persons have been
summarily executed since Allende
died in last Tuesday's military
coup. according to ofﬁcial ﬁgures.

Commission

Washington AI’ A federal
criminal justice commission says
that agrandjury indictment should
no longer be required for any
criminal prosecution.

A grand jury should be retained
as a part of thcjudicral system ori|_\
to iniestigate cases of broad public
concern. such as political corrup-
tioti. said the National Adttsor)
Commission on Criminal Justice
Standards and (ioals.

In a RSK-page report. the corri-
nitssioii recommended a broad
range of reforms in the court
system. Most were designed to
speed trials,

I lie report was prepared by a
member task force headed by
Daniel .I Mcador. a law professor
at the l rinersrt) of \trgtnia. It
coitcluded a two-year study co\cr>

town Santiago. If they are accused
of criminal action. they are moved
to the larger national stadium in
the suburb where “the situation is
then serious."

“Many people have been con-
demned to death and executed in
the national stadium. including
foreigners." the sources asserted.

The reports of executions and a
large number of arrests have not
been conﬁrmed by the junta.
although it has repeatedly warned
that those who resist will be ex—
ecuted immediately.

Helicopters flew over Santiago
on Sunday dropping leaflets that
declared the junta "would not turn
away from executingwithout delay
those terrorists who attack soldiers
or carry arms...“

The junta has announced the ex«
ecutions of three persons accused
of resisting the new regime. Two
were identiﬁed as "extremists" and
thethird was said to bea policeman
who killed two of his superiors.

" I he presentation of evidence is

commission asserted.

The commission said . howeter.
that "in some circumstances. cs-
