every building in tlic mall area
woul soon be demolished.

Many of the residettts were
elderly. and some ltad lived tn the
mall area all their lives. Most ofthc
businesses were marginal. Almost
everyone who lived and did
business there was poor. and for
them the move proved difficult.
Most went to areas directly adja-
cent to the project site. and others
just seem to have disappeared.

in July of I967 it appeared that
the state would do something to
alleviate the acute housing shor-
tage which had developed. Plans
were announced for the construc-
tion of a large housing project
directly below the main mall srte.
The project was to contain a
number of high rise butldings.

Rockefeller administration called

time will tell whether workers will
shop in Albany's stores during
their lunch hour.

That the mail will help the

economic climate of the Albany
area is not questioned. The ques-
tion is: How much'IAnd. isit worth
all the money being spent on it'.’
Will Albanians actually use the
mall facilities, or will the giant
complex sit empty and dark after
working hours?

This leads to what is perhaps the
basic controversy ofthe whole mail
project. Some critics have charged
that the mall represents disordered
priorities. and that the money
should have been spent on com-
munity health centers rather than
fountains. on pollution control
facilities instead ofexpensive mar-
ble covered buildings. and on
public housing projects rather than
an elaborate cultural cortiplex

another was hired to complete the

That the delays have cost money
is shown by the fact that it will cost
nearly twice as much to transplant

originally anticipated. The Matt

years ago. but since that time the
