'tr‘y mm D. Selim

“spite denials by university
officials that such a group ex-
ists. the ASP was able to track
down the University Senate
Council on Formulating Petty
Annoyances (COFPA') This
well-hidden group. chaired by
Emmanual Kafka of the Depart-
ment of Animal Husbandry (his
work has been in breeding
bitches). spends its time
searching for new and in-
novat ive ways to make
students' life as miserable as
possible.

After more than a year of
searching. the ASP was able to
locate Professor Kafka. and to
obtain an interview:

ASP; Professor Kafka. why is it
that no one knows of the ex
istence of your council?

KAFKA: Well. it's fairly ob-
vtous. If there were one place to
put the blame for all the petty tiri-
noyances around this place.
studen ts might be able to effect
some changes. By keeping the
ex istcnce of this group secret.
students continue to think that
all ill the annoyances are com-
r'identiil.

ASI’. \\ Ital is Itexactly thaiyoui
t'lllill('ll does"

lx’AI-‘KA We tll'L' rliarged with
brainstorming the new ideas to
implement each semester that
continue to plague students.

ASI" Iiiit Vi but does that nicitii‘.’
What kinds of innovations have
you Hill“: on Witli‘.’

I(AI"K/\: Well. I certainly don't
have tone to list all of them but
we have Iind quite a few major
successes. One we are especial-
1y proud of around here is the
biirsitr's office. Years ago. we
had a severe problem. Students

pay their bills and leave. ()bv
vioiisly. that couldn't be
tolerated. but the itdiiiinisti'ation
(-ouldn'tcomeupwttliasohition.
So we simply decided
to [WI all of the
bursar's office money in coni-
puter'izmg the DIIIH. That had
twoeffecte first. we had to lot i
couple of people go. so the lines
in front of the bursar‘n office
became intolerable. and second.
there was no rrioney left to hire
good people to program the coin-
puwrs. ()iir motto is "Garbage
lI| garbage out," If you can
screw up the information going
mm the computer. then you Will
only get garbage coming out. so
students Will be held up even
longer.

ASI' In That all you did with the
biirsitr'n office'l

KAI"KA Lord no We started an
entire plIIIt‘y of paperwork liiit

whom they almost iiuvei IIlUVIl

luvt‘n when it student goth to the
Window they stay more for an

hour or no

[\f‘il' In that it“

Bet You Never Heard 'of This One!

KAF‘KA: Certainly not. We had
to devise a massive training
program for the persons who
work there. Do you think that it
is easy to find people to work in
that office? We have nationwide
searches to find the exact per-
sonality type. Most people
would find their guilt driving
them up a well if they let a poor
student wait 30 minutes at the
window while they talked about
a party or a movie only a fewfeet
away. Most people would cut
short the conversation and go
help the student. Do you have
any idea how long it takes to
train It person to continue with
the conversation until the stu-
dent beginsd dribbling at the
mouth?

ASI’: Well. I never realized...

KAI"KA. Of course you never
realized. You young punks
think that all of these things
about naturally. You
no idea how many hours

t'UIlH'
hth-
ol committee work it took to
rIe\-'i.-Iopjiisttheoverlappingand
irrelevant forms for the bursar 5

office alone

ASI' What else have you done?

I(AI"I(/\. Well, one study lllitl
took quite it long time was to find
the one point on campus that
would be the least accessible to
tiiu greatest iimomitof students.
We were looking for the ideal
spot to pred'ugister students.
and to accept dropadd (cards.

The administration really tied
our hands behind our backs on
this one. by demanding that
these things he heldt on campus.
and taking away the gym except
for registration days.

ASI" What did yoti do?

KAI"KA: We mapped out the en»
tire campus. and figured in the
number oi commuter students.
parking. student patterns of
travel. and dozens of other lar'
tors. and With the

Colonial Quad Il-Iioringe.

AHI' 'l'lilil ll it"

KAFKA: Don‘t insult me. young
man. We had many other things
to consider. First. there is ab-
solutely no place to park near
the Colonial Quad for those peo-
ple who just want to stop off and
hand in a drop-add card. Then.
we figured that after the
academic podium. Indian Quad
was out of the question because
too many professors have their
offices in that Quad. and itwould
be convenient for too many peo-
ple. Besides. classes are held in
that Quad. and there is a parking
lot. State and Dutch Quads were
out because both have parking
lots. Some commuter could
stop off on his way into school.
or on the way home. That is un-
thinkable. especially during
pro-registration.

ASI': Have you worked with
other offices?

KAI-‘KA' Sure. almost all of

them. For example, suppose

you begin reading the ad
Iiiinisti'ation's propaganda. We
have presidents and Vice
presidents going all over town
talking about how we want to
make this place ltt‘tittﬁfilllltr to

take courses in any single
semester. you 'tl'lJltllllllllllllclll-
ly out of school. Ifyiin wantto
get back in. you have to reapply.
and Witll. several months for

rciidiiiission

ASI' What's the big deal?
Students just apply several
months early.

l(AI"I(/\ ’l'hat'h’ the beauty of it.
We keep this rule it secret. no
almost nobody reapplin early.
'l‘hey make all ltllltlfi of plans to

AHI‘ You mean there IH no

[2203

 

KAFKA: Of course not. [is stu-
dent has a good average. owes no
money. and isn't in any sort of
trouble. all you have to do is
check this and give him apertnit
to register. Under our system. we
say that four separate offices
must approve the re—
registration. even if the student
has a 3.5 average. and took one
semester off. say. to earn money
or have a baby. They go through
roughly the same process as
someone who flunks out.

ASP: unbelievable. Do you
make all of the innovations
around here?

KAF‘KA: No. sometimes we just
help out. For example. this year
another group unfortunately
made. the excellent
suggestion that"bumps“be put
into several roadways to slow
traffic down. We got the idea as a
finished product. but at the last
minute grit the change made that
raised the bumps high enough
to. say. smain the flywheel cover

ASP: That's really impressive.
I‘m almost afraid to ask about
the registrar's office.

KAFKA: You're right. That‘s
one of our favorites. Ever since
we showed them how to file
everyone's information by the
old student number. just before
the changeover to social
security numbers. thereby
screwing up the books for more
than three years. we have been
under constant call by them.
We did almost everything
