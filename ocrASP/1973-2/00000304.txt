Allende: State of Seige

by Susan Leboft

“State of Siege". a
somewhat propagan-
distic but well—
intentioned movie
directed by Costa-Graves,
is asemi-true account ofa
political kidnapping in
Uruguay. Seeing "State
of Siege" Tuesday night
and learning of the coup
in Chile Wednesday mor-
ning gave one an eerie
sense of deja vu.

The film is frankly sym-
p athetic to the
Tupamaros, mainly
young urban guerrillas
who kidnap a shady
American operative nam-
ed Phillip Michael San-
tore. and a Brazilian
diplomat. In the course of
the film one is made to see
that the Uruguayan police
persecuted the
Tupamaros and active un-
ionists in a very brutal
manner. under Santore's
direction. The Uruguayan
government. nominally a
democracy. is shown to be
no more legitimate than
the Tupamaros
themselves. The film
played at the Hellman for
a week. a suspiciously
short period of time. con-
sidering that the average
stay of a first run movie at
the Hellman is about a
month.

Despite an exaggerated
insistence on the
'I‘upamaros' goodness and
purity. “State of Siege" is
an effective movie. It is a
thousand times more
effective when the follow-
ing morning another
revolutionary movement
in another South

American country is
destroyed with the same
bloody determination the
police in the movie dis-
played.

Disturbing' com-
parisons between the film
and the “suicide” (a word
doomed in this case to
forever be encased in
quotation marks) of Dr.
Salvador Allende
Gossens spring to mind
immediately... In both
cases. Marxist
revolutionaries were
pitted against the forces
of law and order. In both
cases. each side had a
measure of popular sup-
port. The citizens from
whom the Tupamaros
“temporarily ex-
propriated" cars at gun-
point showed a
remarkable amount of
acceptance of the
guerrillas. Allende had a
clear popular mandate.
although. like Nixon. he
eventually abused it. In
each case. the antagonists
were guilty of mutual
provocation. Both
Allende and the
'I‘upamaros angered the
middle Class by acting
vigorously against their
interests. and violating
the law in the pursuit of
their cause.

The most disturbing
question the film brings
into play is whether there
were Santore—typc
Americans in Chile. The
film demonstrated that
Americans who work in
Latin America through
the Alliance for Progress
are there to further

American economic in-
terests. rather than simp-
ly to aid the host country.
We know that before
Allende was elected, the
International Telephone
and Telegraph Corpora-
tion seduced the C.I.A.
into plotting against him.
Fortunately. the C.I.A.‘s
schemes were never put
into action. Certainly
American officials in-
volved with Chile, at‘least
the majority of them.
denied Allende the sup-
port that could have saved
him. The US. worked to
undermine Chile's credit
rating. and generally
treated Allende with un—
seenin caiiousness. If all
this does not amount to
meddling. it amounts to
something that could be
called malignant
neglect“.

Those who argue that
Allende fell because he
acted beyond his mandate
must add that he acted
beyond his mandate
because he was forced to
acr alone. If he‘d had
anything near the type of
help the repressive
Uruguayan government
had from the United
State v in the film. his term
of office mighthave ended
with much better results.
and with much less harm
to the democratic cause in
Chile.

 

Gilbert:

" Alone Again at Saratoga'

by Maureen D. Greiss
Last Thursday night.

Saratoga Springs Perfor-
ming Arts Center
presented Gilbert
O'Sullivan in concert.
The concert was the open-
ing of his first U. S. tour
and therefore his first
appearance in front of “a
live" American audience.

The program began
with comedian Marty
Barris who had expressly
promised the audience
only one “dirty” joke.
However. his many all but
subtle inuendo's made up
for any lack of playful sex
humor

Also appearing on the
same bill was pretty
blonde-haired Maureen
McGovern who attained
her fame with the Gram-
my winning hit song from
The Poseidon Adventure -
"The Morning After". In a
strong. lovely voice. she
sang a total ofnine songs-

ranging from blues to
ballads.

Then. out popped
Gilbert who had just

ﬂown in from England.
He was wearing a black V»
necked sweater with a big
red "G" on the front as
were all members of his
orchestra.

When he stopped to
chat, he was exceedingly
charming with a distinct

British accent and
childlike expressions. It
was unusual to watch him
stop. in the midst of his
new release. “Out of the
Question" to dance with
his bandleader.

Towards the end of the
concert. he sang the songs
which made his a recor-
ding success, such as
"Clair". “Alone Again
Naturally". and his
current hit. Get Down".

After the show. Miss
McGovern signed
autographs backstage
while Gilbert was
nowhere to be found. The
suspicion is that he
changed into street
clothes. put on a hat and
casually strode by his
anxious fans. But that's
only a hunch.

Gilbert(real name Ray-
mond O‘Sullivan) was
born in Waterford.
Southern Ireland in 1946.
His father was a butcher
there when the family
decided to move to
England. it was during
the Beatle era. when
Gilbert was still a student
at Art College. that he
developed an urge to write
songs. He never intendel
to be a recording artist
and to this day he cori-
tends. “ l'ni essentially a
song writer slio happens
to record his own work-
not a pop star."

The Greatest Musician

ll) 1.. Dari.»

We slipped into a bar
near the subway. to have
one last drink just as the
last call was being made,
As the bartender runlcdl
his glasses in the wash
tub we ordered. and soon
were slipping into a back
booth. Behind us a drunk
rattled onward about the
greatest musician he had
ever seen in his eighty
years of life. “Even
greater than..."
somebody he mumbled.
With curiosity I turned
and asked who he was
speaking ol. The old man

claimed now to have met a
veteran returning from
W.W.l., who he claimed
was the greatest guitarist
he had ever seen. Again as
he rambled onward. "‘he
could only play slide
guitar. that's all he could
play and he would make
all of these young dudes
look sick". impatiently i
asked the man how come
he could only play slide
guitar. could not he pick
also? and if he was so
good what was his name.
He says. "i don‘t know
who . he was just with his
regiment in a railway sta-
tion singing some crazy
song about the moon."

Again i asked why the
guy only played slide
guitar"? The answer

followed. “nobody
believes me when 1 tell
them. The guy had losthis

now just hild‘alluok lot a ilullti.

and he had this way of
rigging an old spent car—
tridge. his slide. into the
hook and he played." The
old guy then stumbled out.
i came back the nextiiiglit
to see if he would come
back. for my curiosity
was aroused but nobody
had ever seen him before:
another artist was lost in
the annals of Lime.

Weather Report: Sweet Nighter

Weather Report is one of
the most successful,
tasteful innovative
groups in the world today.

With roots that are
entwined deeply around
Miles and further onward;
J De Z a winul o n
keyboards: Wayne
Shorter on saxophone,
Miroslav Vitous. bass;
Eric Gravatt. drums: and
dom Um Romao make up
the group that has made
its name an important
part of the annuls ofjazz.

Appearing last Sunday
in Lenox and earlier this
summer at S.P.A.C. with
BB. King. Weather

Report is at last receiving
their due acclaim among
the straighter. un»
sophisticated audiences
of rock music.

Side one of "Sweet
Nighter” opens up hard
and heavy with a nun-
coniposed by Zawinul cn-
titled "Boogic Woogw
Waltz". ’l‘he drumming is
precise piano synthesiz-
cd. and Shorter's alto sax
the only indicator needed
of his talents. At the end
of the cut the band burst
forward in flying furor,
harmonizingecstatically.
Next."Manolete”.written
by Shorter. is incom-
parable. with a tune
beginning with a funky.
wild jazz improvisational

type of drumming. The
percussions are great
with assorted other studio
musicians aiding
throughout. "Adios"
completes this side. also
being composed by
Zawinul along with the
first two cuttings on the
next Side; "125
Street Congress“ and
“Will”. In fitting conclu-
sion to the album "NOD
stop Home Again.‘ is a
tribute to Shorter's
talents with some mighty
fine horn being exhibited.

some to comprehend a
