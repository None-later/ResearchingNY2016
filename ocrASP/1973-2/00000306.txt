Maybe it was because no one
had anything else to do...maybe
becauscot the earlier football scrim-
mage...maybe the publicity...or
maybe the fact that the team has
been winning. but well over 400
fans showed up for Saturday's
Quadrangular Tournament. and
they were "tilted to one of the
better soccer exhibitions this cam«
pus has seen in a long time.

First. the fans saw the Danes
devastate Williams. as the hooters
dominated play. Next. the hooters

In addition to the immediate
cllcctsol the budget cut. l)r. Ward
was concerned With its long range

students wrll now he iit the hands of

(It further concern to Ward is
the fact that the new regulations
"eliminate the private student."
Under the new system. the “spon-
sored" student. the one usually
funded by his or her own govern-
ineitt. is in art advantageous posi»

()rie argument presented by Dr.
Ward was the fact that the waiver
program was such a modest one to
begin with. Under the old
regulations the school was allowed
to offer waivers to 2 per cent ofits
student population. Wardclaimed
that the 2 percent figure was never
even reached.

Rodriguez was less than satisfied
With the general support given to
the international students on this

need for ntore cooperation among
groups on campus. he expccially
pointed to academic groupssueh as
the foreign language departments.
He stressed the cultural and in-

departments.

(Ienerally speaking. it is
