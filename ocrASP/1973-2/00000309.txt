 Albany; ‘N.Y.-AP - Morale
dipped in the Albany Police
Department a few years ago
because only a few policemen were
granted the opportunity to loot
parking meters. a patrolman iden-
tified only as “Officer Y“ told the
State Investigation Commission
Thursday.

“Some men were unhappy
because they were not getting their
share." he said. “So the sergeant
decided that the money should be
divided equally amongst all
members of the squad, no matter
who picked it up."

Did that solve the morale
problem? “No.” said Officer Y.
“the men started to steal from each
other.‘ '

The testimony drew chuckles

from the 60 persons gathered in the
small ooumOotrL._lt»was given in
the third day of public hearings by
the SIC ‘into alleged police corrup-
tion in New York's capital city.

Ofﬁcer Y did not physically
appear in the hearing room He
was closeted in an adjacent room
with Joseph Fisch, the SIC chief
counsel. The answers by Ofﬁcer Y
to question were heard by the
audience through a loudspeaker
placed in the haring room.

The disembodied voice sketched
a systemized pattern of parking
meter thefts and store burglaries by
the squad on which he served.

"I acted like 1 went along. I told
them I took stuffl didn’t take. My
standing improved and l was
accepted." he said. The policeman
said the thefts and burglaries were
encouraged by his squad leader.

parking meter thefts shortly after
he joined the department eight
years ago.

"You paid the sergeant for the
parking meter assignment. You
would 'give him SlS for each time
you got the assignment. It was a
good assignment," he said.

The money collected was not all
turned in. The officers kept some of
it.“

Ofl'icer Y said he once netted
$125 in a single day in parking
meter dimes and nickels. “I‘ve
heard of them taking $300 a day.

our salary because we were getting
such low pay.“ he said. At that
time, Albany policemen were paid
about $6,500 a year. The salary has

since jumped to near $9.000.
After several squad members

complained that they were not
given a chance to loot the meters.
Officer Y said. Kennedy decided to
divide the money equally.

"We’ would put the money in a
large paper bag. and use a small
paper cup as a measuring device.
The money would be put in small
paper for each man of the squad."

OfficerY accused Kennedy ofin-
timidating men to persuade them
to commit burglaries.“Many times
he ordered men to get things ior
him."

“The preferred way was to open
the door and close it afterwards.“

said the unseen witness. “Some of
the men weren't that patient, lllct
