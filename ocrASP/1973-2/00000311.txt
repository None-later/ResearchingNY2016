On September I, 1973 Public Health Law 33, Mental
Hygiene Law SI, and Penal Law 220 credited this
state with yet another distinction. New Yorkers were
about to face the “toughest drug law in the
nation.“

The purpose of the law, stated in general
terms was to reduce in number the rising corps of hard
drug addicts whose search for means of supporting their
habit led to an increasingly higher violent crime rate.
Why is the new drug law necessary? What is the new law
all about? These questions were frequently asked of
Governor Roekerfeller. the prime crusader for the new
legislation. The bill was vehemently Opposed by New
York City‘s mayor John Lindsay. many district at-
torneys and prominentjurists. law enforcement officials.
and civil libertarianslargely on the grounds that it would

 

crush an already o\erburdened criminal justice system
and discriminate "irrationally" against drug
offenders. Despite claims the bill lacked sensitivity. the
conservative legislature. eager to appease their con-
stituents growing discontent with crime. made into law
the bill that mandated inﬂexible penalties. /\s for
Rockerfcllcr.the state's consistent record of failure in the
streets. courts. and rehabilitation centers would do little
for a five term governor hot on the trot for the White
House.

The genesis of the new lawpointed at the failure ofthe
state's efforts iii the past. One upstate legislator remark-
ed. “the millions and millions of taxpayer dollars poured
into rehabilitation programs only provided a small
percentage ol thestate's addicts with a fair program at
best. The governor concluded that the only workable
deterrent to rising drug addiction rested wrth still
penalties looming over the heads of dealers atrd user's."

 

larlurclan expensive pne at thal.'l he state had spent well
over two hilliori dollars in the establishment and marri-
tanence ol these facilities. liul the governor did not shy
away lronr the blame. He told a groupol legislatorsthat.
“the state‘s emphasis on rehabilitation of drug addicts
was irot solving the problem. Our program vras trot
achievrng that goal and I'm not only ready to admit it.
I'm anxrous to admit It. llut l artr corivrnccd that alter
everything else. there is notliriig less we cart do.

 

'While the new laws may have been targeted primarily
towards the use and sale of heroin. the specifics ofthe bill
Were not. There is something in the law for everyone in
possessionofany narcotic. And while the laws success in
reducing drug abuse remains to be tested. one thinn it has
effectively raised is the level of confusion among users.
sellers. and others who in someway concern themselves
with the bills provisions.

The state of New York. iii an effort to communicate
the perils of illegal drug activity, spent a whopping half
million dollars in a last minute media blitz. The theme of
the campaign was “Don‘t get caught holding the bag."
Newspapers throughout the state carried the all too
familiar chart classifying felonies and penalties for in—
dividual drugs adding in some measure to the confusion.

What follows i s an attempt to sift through the myraid
ofdetails. elliminate the rumors. and illuminate the bill's
emphasis.

The new legislation forces judges to impose life
sentences on any defendent who is convicted of either
selling or possessing specific amounts of specific drugs.
It also imposes a minimum prison sentence for those
convicted of the sale or possession of lesser amourtts of
certain illegal drugs. The extent on which a defendant
can employ “plea bargaining,”a system in which a defen-
dant agreesto plead guilty in return fora lesser offense. is
li.rtited in degree and stringent penalties are imposed on
all second offenders.

 

llie lavr covers over 40 drugs ranginglromrrrarnuana
to | Sl).lococain.arid heroin. Drugs pi'cscrihed,sueh as
iliet pills including arriphetamirics and coiiglt syrups corr-
tairiing codeine are part of the law and provide penalties
for their misuse or sale. Anyone convicted ol
selling arty amount ol a narcotic drug must be sentenced
to life in prison. llie new law defines rrarcotrc drugs to
include opitirri and opiates. cocaine, heroin. methadone,
rriorphine.and codeine. Possession ol live inilligramsol
