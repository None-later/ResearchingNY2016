DeMarco Finishes First

by tom Alanine

One hundred wins for cross-
.country coach Bob Munsey.as
Albany defeated Plattsburgh
and St. Michael's in a
triangular meet at Plattsburgh.
Albany, now 3-0. is l00-l8
overall in its ll years.

Albany dominated the field
as expected finishing all seven
runners ahead of the op-
ponents. Nick DeMarco was
the‘winncr in a time of32z37 on
the (Li mile course. DeMarco.
who has finished second in his
last race was followed by Curt
Woodcock. Chris Burns. John
Koch. Vinnie Reda. Bill Sorel
and Ron Dunn.

For Reda this was his best
showing yet and Coach
M unscy was very pleased about
his performance. Reda is
counted on being one of the big
men at the end.

injured Jim Shader again
skipped the meet. He might be
ready for Saturday‘s meet ver-
sus the Coast (iuard and

Montclair State. Saturday‘s
winner Carlo Cherubino and
Herb Hasan did not run.

The quality of the competi-
tion was minimalbut the course
is long and foreign and
Albany‘s performance was im-
pressive. The question of
whether this team has peaked
too soon is not yet discernable
. Last year Albany beat
l’lattsburgh l(i-47.

Albany last year hosted
Saturday‘s opponents
Montclair State and Coast
Guard. The sco res Were Albany

Mohammed Ali: Always A Champion?

by Blll Heller

“i want Joe Frarier! 1 want Joe
Frazierl." Muhammed Ali yelled
into Howard Cosell's mike. alter
his split-decision victory over Keri-
nyNorton.Coscllsoberlyanaly/ed
it as Ali. knowing that now he
wasn't good enough to regain the
championship. simply wanted to
avenge his lirst loss to l‘ra/ier. And
then retire.

In fact. Cosell has gone to a great
ends to prove that A li isn't the same
fighter he was in his prime. “He‘s a
shell of the fighter he once was."
llut everyone realizes Ali isn't the
same young boxer who did so
much for his sport of boxing. And
Muhammed Ali realizes ittoo: “lfl
was in my prime. I would‘ve
whipped Kenny Norton."
