Danes Optimistic For First Game

Brook.

by Bruce Mnggin

Tomorrow afternoon the
Albany State Great Dane football
team will play its first game ever as
mnity team when they cot-r.-
cfub opponent Stony Brook in a l
p.m. start.

Last week tiie Danes scrim-
maged against Hudson Valley.
Albany was flat and was soundly
defeated. but Coach Bob l‘ord dis-
counts tfie loss. “Looking at it from
the winning and losing aspect. it
was a disaster. Looking at it from
the gross viewpoint. we got it
chance to see many different peo-
ple and try out many different
things. it was also good to knock
the wind out of the sails. The team
was a little for and happy after the
Union scrimmage and expected the
next nine opponents to roll over."

The fact that Coach Ford played
his entire 82 men squad did not
help matters either.

Against Hudson Valley. the
defensive play was fairly respec-
table with only one of two
breakdowns occuring. They didn‘t
stunt and played their normal base
defense.

On offense Ford felt that starting
quarterback John Bertuzzi “did
not have a good day reading
defenses." Also there was the
problem of rotating many players
in and out of the lineup. Because of
lack of playing time. halfback can-
didates George Hollie and Own

2 wwﬂﬁ

Griffin only carried the ball oncea
piece. Ford feels that “You must
get the ball into the hands of people
who can put the ball into the end
zone." Hopefully. they will see
more action tomorrow.

One of the negative trademarks
of the Dane football team has been
fumbles. This was quite evident in
the Hudson Valley game. The
Danes. by using the wishbone-"f.
cause their chances of fumbling to
greatly increase because of the
many split type decisions that must
be made. The numerous fumbles
against Hudson Valleywere partly
caused by the many new players.

Physically. tiic Danes came
out of the Hudson Valley scrim-
mage in very good shape.
However. on Wednesday. starting
center Andy Lee banged up his
knee and isdefinitely out for Satur-
day's game. Joe Amedore will take
his place. The injury to Lee is
doubly unfortunate because the
offensive line has been one of the
few weaknesses on the team rind he
will be missed. Also missing from
tomorrow‘s game will be defensive
end Vinnie Pierce. who will be
replaced by Frank Leader.

Coach Ford prides himself on
having a super job done when
scouting opponents, with such
techniques as computer readouts
being used. But this is the first
game for both teams and not much
is really known about Stony

Last year Albany grabbed an
early lead and held on to defeat
Stony Brook 14-0. Stony Brook
finished at 4-5. Their coach is high-
ly optimistic about the coming
season. Coach John Buckman feels
that “There is nobody on our
schedule we can't beat. One of
Stony Brook's defensive ends .lim
McDanicls, as quoted in the Stony
Brook Statesman. said “Last year
we went in ft little scared of
Albany‘s reptitatiori and we lost f4-
f) without letting them complete a
iss. This year i know wewill win."
Stony Brook does have good
talent but depth has been a
problem. They have excellent
speed. including a big fullback who
runs the hundred in 9.7. Stony
Brook. like Albany. runs out ofthe
wishbone—T. On defense they use
the pro set.

 

Coach f-‘ord hopes to "out hus-
tlc. out coach and out organize
Stony Brook." He plansto try and
establish a running game and
hopefully wear Stony Brook down.

The keys for this week and weeks
hence will be how well Bertuzri can
read defenses and how strong is his
offensive line. The defense is solid
but they must settle down.

The weather forecast for
tomorrow‘s game is good and Ford
hopes for a big turnout by the
students.
