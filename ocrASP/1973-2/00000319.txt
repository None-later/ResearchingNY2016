Danes Optimistic For First Game

by Bruce Mnggin

Tomorrow afternoon the
Albany State Great Dane football
team will play its first game ever as
mnity team when they entert—
club opponent Stony Brook in a l
p.m. start.

Last week the Danes scrim-
maged against Hudson Valley.
Albany was ﬂat rind was soundly
defeated. but Coach Bob l‘ord dis-
counts the loss. “Lookingal it from
the winning and losing aspect. it
was a disaster. Looking tit it from
the gross viewpoint. we got a
chance to see many different peo-
ple and try out many different
things. It was also good to knock
the wind out of the sails. The team
was a little fat and happy after the
Union scrimmage and expected the
next nine opponents to roll over.“

The fact that Coach Ford played
his entire 82 men squad did not
help matters either.

Against Hudson Valley. the
defensive play was fairly respec-
table with only one of two
breakdoWns occuring. They didn‘t
stunt and played their normal base
defense.

On offense Ford felt that starting
quarterback John Bertuzzi "did
not have a good day reading
defenses.“ Also there was the
problem of rotating many players
in and out ofthe lineup. Because of
lack of playing time. halfback can-
didates George Hollie and Oron

Griffin only carried the hall oncca
piece. Ford feels that “You must
get the ball into the hands of people
who can put the ball into the end
zone.“ Hopefully. they will see
more action tomorrow.

One of the negative trademarks
of the Dane football team has been
fumbles. This was quite evident in
the Hudson Valley game. The
Danes. by using the wishbone-T.
cause their chances of fumbling to
greatly increase because of the
many split type decisions that must
he made. The numerous fumbles
against Hudson Valleywerc partly
caused by the many new players.

Physically. the Danes came
out of the Hudson Valley scrim-
magc iti very good shape.
However. on Wednesday. starting
center Andy Lee banged up his
knee and is definitely out for Satur-
day's game. Joe Aniedore will take
his place. The injury to Lee is
doubly unfortunate because the
offensive line has been one of the
few weaknesses on the team and he
will be missed. Also missing from
tomorrow‘s game will be defensive
end Vinnie Pierce. who will be
replaced by Frank Leader.

Coach Ford prides himself on
having a super job done when
scouting opponents. with such
techniques as computer rcadouts
being used. But this is the first
game for both teams and not much
is really known about Stony

Brook.

Last year Albany grabbed an
early lead and held on to defeat
Stony Brook l4-0. Stony Brook
finished at 4-5. Their coach is high-
ly optimistic about the coming
season. Coach John B uckma it feels
that "There is nobody on our
schedule we can‘t beat. One of
Stony Brook‘s defensive ends .litn
McDanicls'. as quoted in tlic Stony
Brook Statesman. said "Last year
we went in a little scared of
Albany‘s reputation and we lost [4-
t) without letting them complete a
pass'l'his ycarlknowwewillwin.“

Stony Brook does have good
talent but depth has been a
problem. They have excellent
speed. including a big fullback who
runs the hundred in 9.7. 'Stony
Brook. like Albany. runs out ofthe
wishbone-T. On defense they use
the pro set.

Coach Ford hopes to "out hus-
tle. out coach and out organize
Stony Brook." He plans to try and
establish a running game and
hopefully wear Stony Brook down.

The keys for this week and weeks
hence will be how well Bertuzzi can
read defenses and how strong is his
offensive line. The defense is solid
but they must settle down.

The weather forecast for
tomorrow‘s game is good and Ford
hopes for a big turnout by the
students.

The Albany State (ireat Danes

hooters opened their I973 season
this pastWednesday.-.no believe it
or not. they won. 11 was a convin-
crng 3-0 victory over host R.l’.l..
and it was the first time in I3 years
that the Danes had beaten their
arch rivals. It was also the Danes
ﬁrst Win in one year. and the first
time the Danes have been over the
.500 mark in two years. and quite
honestly. provided this writer with
his first opportunity to write about
a Dane season win in two years.

The game can be summed up in
two wurds which have not been
uttered on the soccer fields here at
SUNYA in eons: Dane Domina-
tion. The Danes were devastating.
much more so than the score might
indicate. Check out these stats:
R.l’.l. had only six shots on net.
and Dane rictiniridcr Henry
()l)Witlt.l was called upon only once
during the entire game. an obvious
tribute to the [rite balance this team
displays. Meanwhile. the Ditties
were putiinielirig the NIH. out
With 2H attempts. including 3 goals
and 5 off the crossbar.

The game opened with Albany in
possession and l{.|’.l. unable to
cross the mid field line. Once again
it was merely a riiritteroltime until

the Ditties scored the first tally of
the game. coming after twelve

minutes of play. (jarroway. alone
in froiitpickcd the corner. and it
was quickly l—t). Fifteen minutes
later. the Danes tallied again. as
Aldrich scored. and the score was
2-0 at the half. It could just as well
been 54) With a couple of extra
breaks. but. as things turned out
they were not necessarv.

The second half opened with the
only |t.l’ l. threat ofthe day.arid it
went quickly by the boards. Once
again Dane Domination set in. and
Brow-Marke went the length. led
Martinez. and the Danes scored.
l-inal score: 3—0.

Stars of the game? None really.
It was exactly the type of team ef-
lort Coach Scheiffeliii has praised
rtgltt through the exhibition
season. Interestingly enough. Jose
ltuario. the star of the exhibition
season. barely touched the ball. as
the Danes scurried to concentrate
the play on the R.l’.|. right side.

However. Carlos Royito. a btgdts-
appointment in the exhibition
season. finally came alive and
played his best garric of the year.

All in all. it was a firi‘e start for a
team composed of ‘ freshmen.
all of whom were playing their first
college gariics. Coach Schiefleliri
was satsil'icd with the win. but felt
that the Danes ltad failed to
capitali/e on several scoring
threats. Surprisingly enough. he
had little to saya’bout thcganie, his
emphasis now on the possible tur—
ning point. or proving point of the
season" this Saturday at lii'cdonra.
