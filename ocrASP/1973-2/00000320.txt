of ﬁnancial assistance available un-
der the Higher Education Oppor-
tunity Program (HEOP) to include
textbook aid. Students will now be
allowed up to $50 a semester or $25
a summersession for books.

The HEOP program is designed
to encourage minority group
students with ability to attend
college'and to successfully com-
plete their studies. It combines
financial assistance with counsel-
ing. remedial studies and special
tutorial work when required.

In the [973-74 school year,some
5.300 students are expected to par-
ticipate in the program and will
receive an average of$ I400 each to
cover the costs of tuition. room.
board and other academic costs.

The University of New
Hampshire has reduced tuition for
in-statc students for the second
year in a row. The University
received one of the biggest percen-
tage increases in its history in the
budget adopted by the state
legislature.

University President Thomas H.
Bonner said that not only are ap—
propriations up and tuition down.
but that instatc applications from
students have increased ten per-

cent, dormitories are full and-the
demand for on-campus housing
has increased.

Sixty inmates from Ossining
State Correctional Facility will be
attending Hostos Community
College (CUNY) in the Bronx dur-
ing the [973-74 academic year.

The prisoners, who will be buscd
daily to the school, will comprise
the largest gr0up of prisoners in
any study-release program in the
state. The program is an offshoot
ofa program began Iastyear by the
Center of Puerto Rican Studies
and Research at CUNY.

Participants in the tuition free
program will be selected by
members oftlie Hostos counseling
staff and must be approved by a
release committee. The program
was approved by the New York
State Legislature in l97l. The
legislation excludes prisoners
associated with organized crime.
those convicted of violent crimes.
those judged escape risks. those
serving long or additional
sentences. those who have
threatened persons outside the cor-
rectional institution and “those
who display undue emotional up-
set.“

According to Dr. Frank Bonilla.
Director of the City University
Puerto Rican Center. State Cor-
rectional officials have made no
stipulations regarding security dur-
ing the l4 hoursadaythe prisoners
will be away from Ossining. The in-
mates will be free to mix with other
H ostos students oftheirchoice and
will be free to participate in ex-
tracurricular activities.

A Louisiana state grandjury has
closed its term without returning
indictments in a I972 shootinginci-
dent at Southern University that
left two students dead. After
questioning fi7 witnesses. thejury
said it was unable to determine
who fired the fatal shots in the con-
frontation that began when
Louisiana state police moved onto
the campus to dislodge black
students who had gained control of
the Baton Rotigce campus tid-
ministration building.

'I'hc Stale Agricultural and
Technical College at Ftirmingdale

Nice Guy of the Senate,

by Elle Axelroth

As chairwoman of the Universi-
ty Senate. Dr. Edith Cobiine
believes in completely “open

I policy." To insure communication

with students she is trying ad-
ditional techniques this year. One
such technique is an open Senate
forum between University Senate
meetings. 'l‘hese mectingsare infor-
mal and are open to all students
who wiin to air their views on
current issues. bring new is sites to
the attention of the Senate. or who
just want to see Universin govern-
ment in action. They are also
\nluitblc to Senators who want to
study an issue before it comes to
the llooi of the S 'nate.

l hc University Senate consists
of two-thirds faculty and onc<third
students. They are the governing
body of the University and
ttssunic legal power from the Board
of li'tixtccsolSUNYA. l’thenntc
decides such matters as grade point
average necessary for dean‘s list.
the calendar. parking regulations
and use of firearms by Security,
Subcommittees of the Senate deal
broadly with such issues as coin-
miiiiity relations. promotions and
tenure. aiiid judicial reform.

by the chairman is due to the “in-

chairman. the “individual‘s per-

others. She believes that the
