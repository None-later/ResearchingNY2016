Though they appreciate the

need for a day are Center on cam- -

pus. residents of Pierce Hall are
currently circulating a petition
protesting the usurpation‘of their
dorm space by the university.
“Wethe undersigned residents of
Pierce ‘Hall ﬁnd that wearedenicd
those facilities which all other
residents of this University do ob.
tain. We are the only dorm which
does not have an area in which we
are ableto assemble. Wewould like
to request that the Day Care
Center which is located in our
lowor lounge be relocated to
Brubacher ‘Hall. We are charged
the same amount as other residents

The children become the unwitting objects

 

of this University. yet we are un-
able to have a dorm party ora full
assembly of the residents.

“We feel that it is important to
note that while we believe strongly
in the day care facility, we also
believe strongly in equal facilities
for all residents of this University.“

The reason students advocate
the use of meacltcr Hall for
relocation is because. according to
co-author of the petition Elise
Douglas. “no one is ever in the
lounges there.” The protesting
students understand that the un-
iversity remodeled the lower
lounge. but also felt the university
was being discriminatory. Section
meetings are held in a small lounge

on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. but full dorm
meetings are impossible through
simple lack of space.

The purpose of the petition is to
make people aware of the situa-
tion. “Maybe we can't change
anything this year. but may be next
year." is Miss Douglas' attitude.

An alternative solution to the
dorm‘s grievances would be using
the area the center now occupied
on weekends and nights. Since the
center is not open then. they feel it
would be possible. A problem
arises however. lfstudents were to
use this area. it would immediately
become a university-afﬁliated
space. As it is now. the university
has no responsibility for main-
tainencc there. If the university
were afﬁliated. janitorial services
would have to be provided.

Sabrina Viscilla. co-author of
thc petition. hopes that students

later was revealed to be former
Albany Policeman. Donald
Leonard. took the stand. He
recited a list of more than a dolen
burglaries he‘d committed between
I962 and I967. the period when he
\vasa mcmbcr oftheAlbany Police
Force. Mr. Leonard named Police
Lieutenant Kenneth Kennedy. who
was a sergeant at the time. as the
organizer ofsome of the burglaries.
Under Kennedy‘s orders. accor-
ding th Leonard. policemen robb—
ed {021 I’cnncy‘s and Lowe

Wcstgate shopping center.
According to the witness.
Kcnncdy also coordinated
systematic robberies of parking
meters. Mr. Leonard Iiad bribed a
sergeant with Slim so hccould be
assigned to parking meter collec-
tion. Upon gettingtlicassignmcnt.
Iic had taken home up to $250.00 a
week front the meters.

Mr. Leonard further testiﬁed
that Albany policemen had to
make contributions to the
Democratic party in order to get‘
promotions.

On 'l'hursday. the third day of
hearings. another “Mystery
Witness" also added to the
testimony of alleging burglaries by
policemen. As of this writing. this
witness‘s identity remains a secret.
despite the fact that Mayor Cor-
ning has called for his unmasking.

According to this witness. who
also stole hundreds of dollars from
parking meters. Lieutenant
Kennedy took charge of dividing
mcter money up equally among
seven to fourteen men. so that no
one hadgcd burglar would be en-
vious of another. However this
“didn‘t solve the morale
problem...the mcn started to steal
from each other".

Postal Rate Hike?

WASHINGTON AP - Post-
master General E. 'l‘. Klassen Mon-
day proposed raising the cost of air
mail and ﬁrst class letter stamps
two cents and increases in the other
classes of mail ranging form 6 to 38
percent.

“The cost-price squeeze has
affected us as much as it has
affected the rest of the economy.“
said Klassen in a speech to the
National Press Club.

Klassen said the new rate
schedule would be submitted for
approval of the Postal Rate Com-
mission Tuesday.

Asked if he thought Congress
would ultimately allow the rate in-
creases.Klassen said “I don‘t know.

If they don't. taxpayers are going
to have to pay the price“ of
operating the postal service.

Klassen said the proposed in-
creases in all classes of mail would
amount to an increase of $2.l
billion in postal service revenue.

Economy moves within the serve
made it possible to cancel the
proposed hikes of last January.
Klasscii said. adding: “However.
most of out customers clearly in-
dicatcd that high service standards
were more important to them than
our efforts to hold the line on ex-
pcnditurcs in prices."

Undcr Klassen's proposal the
price ofan air mail stamp would go
front ll cents to I] centszﬁrst class
from the current eight cents to 10
cents. Second class rates would in-
crease 38 per cent: thire class 25 per
cent. and fourth class parcel post. 6
