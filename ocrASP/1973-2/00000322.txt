Speck! to the ASP

On Sunday, September l6,
Senate Majority Leader Warren
M. Anderson announced that the
proposed $3.5 billion Bond Issue is

.a total transportation package
which is as important to the
economic wellbeing of Upstate
New York as it ,is for residents of
the New York City Metiﬁopolitan
area. Its defeat in November
would be a “most serious" setback
to‘economic growth in the move-
ment of people, goods and services
all over the State, he said.

Speaking at the dinner of the
Empire State Petroleum Associa-
tion at the Neville Hotel in Ellen-
ville, Senator Anderson urged the
industry to join in a campaign to
help the public fully understand the
purpose of the proposal.

“If the people are given the facts.
they will support it,"lie predicted.
They will see that it contains the
answer to New York State's pre-

sent transportation probiems','and
seeks to solve many of the

problems of the future as well.

“Some are calling it a subway
subsidy plan of interest only in the
metropolitan area, and wonder
why those of us in upstate areas
should be concerned.

“Well, it’s'not that simple.

“This proposal offers more than
just help for the subways."

"It would put the State on the
right track toward- -a balanced
transportation system, encom-
passing not only’ big-city subways
but also intercity rail service.
municipal bus service, arterial
highways and completion of our
interstate highway network and the
old Erwin. now Donovan, rural
roads program.

“Make no mistake about this:
The proposed Bond Issue is a rural
transportation package. Of the
$3.5 billionwhich itwould provide.

SL4 billion will go for highway
construction including $400
million it] the Long Island and
lower-Hudson suburban area and
$750 million in the rest of what we
call ‘upstate‘.

“With federal and local sub-
sidies. this means that more than $4
billion in highway improvements
will be advanced over the next few
years. And, while someemphasis is
going to be placed on arterial
highways, the bulk of the road
funds will be used forthe improve-
ment of existing facilities and for
the town road program.

“Of equal importance to
providing the tracks and cars for
the railroads and subways, the
buses and terminals for city bus
service, and the concrete and
asphalt for highways is the man-
date that the Department of
Transportation developed by I975
a plan for meeting the State‘s
future transportation problems of
moving people.

“This-is important because it
would not only meet today‘s
problems, but would insure that we
have the capability to face new
problems as they develop,

"Those who have doubts about
the size of the Bondilssue should
recognize the size of the problem.
They would see that inflation has
taken more than its share of the
bond funds approved in I967. and

that the defeat of the l97l bond pro
nasal left the State without gentry
to meet some of its obligations.\‘
“These ' people] should
also recognizethat, if this proposal
should fail, our revenue structure
will not provide what the best
transportation experts deem ade-
quate funds for highway construc-
tion. let alone subsidizing
operating costs of mass transit.
“The effects on the peoplcof our
State through the loss of services.
and on the economy as well. would
be most serious.”

NEW YORK AP - Mobster Car-
mine “The Snake“Persico went to
trial Monday on a charge of plut-
ting to harbor an accused murder
fugitive, with a judge again trying
to black out his underworld record.
A similar attempt in another case
was ruled out of order on appeal.

"Please use restraint in covering
this trial,“ Brooklyn federal court
Judge John Bartels (pld newsmen.
“‘if any defendant here has any
prison record please do not publish
it.“
