In the Name ofAllende

To the editor:

This letter is in response to
Susan Leboff's article “Allende:
State of Siege" which appeared in
the ASP on Sept. l8.l have been in
this country for a little more than a
year and each time I am more con-
vinced that the people of the US.
are illiterate when looking at
problems of developing countries.
This inhuman illiteracy is operated
in the "concern and goodwill"
perpetrated by the US. on the
nations of the Third World in the
form of “development aid".

Susan is really naive when she
says that “if he‘d (Allende) had
anything near the type of help the
repressive Uruguayan government
had from the U.S....his term of of-
fice might have ended with much
better results..." Do you expect the
U.S. gosernment to commit
suicide’.’ If you did not Know: the
indUstrialiIed countries "transfer"
resources tti underdei eloped coun-
tries in the form of "aid" (like in-
structing policemen and
militarynien in the techniques of
torture and repression) only tti
protect their own interests. iti-
terests which are compatible with
an espltiitritise social structure til
"free enterprise and democracy"
and incompatible with a soctalist
gtiiernment likeAlleride‘s. As in
"State of Siege" when the tour-
nalist said " l he (ienerals. who are
ntit ricli. htit are supposed to
protect the rich. the bankers and
loreigti inicstnients " lliese
(iettertils. Susan, are trained in
“ashtngttin under the
"Allianceior Progress" in the holy
name of prtiiits.

The human murder by pii\erty
and starvation in Latin America is
secret. lhe systematic \itilence is
not apparent but it‘s real and con-
stantly increasing. its l’lUlflCilliil\

It) these statistics. the amount
shared by (i millions at the top of

the pyramid is the same as the
amount shared by I40 millions at
.the bottom in Latin America.

History teaches us that some
nations specialize in winning and
others in losing. Latin America was
precocious: it has specialized in los-
ing ever since Columbus landed in
San Salvador. We are no longer in
the time of the Conquests. but our
region continues to exist at the ser-
vice of other‘s needs. as a source
and reserve of oil and copper. meat
and bananasiChiquita).coffee and
raw materials destined to the rich
countries. and mainly to thell. 5..
which profit more from consuming
them than we do from producing
them. Along the way we ha\e e\eti

For those who see history as a
competition. and “Americans” do.
backwttrdness and pmerty are
merely a result of its failure. We
lost. others won. But the winners
happen to have won thanks to otir
losing. because the history of Latin
America‘s underdmelopmeni is an
integral part of the history of

To The Editor:

I'm sorry to hear that. the
controversial film. Fritz—
Ihe Car . . did not strike the
fancy oi voicere Iris Alex-
ander and Stephanie
Stewart. If their interpreta-
tion was that it was "a.
negative film promoting pre-
judice inlits true form. aimed
specifically at black people"

(I happen to disagree), then
so be it. But. to imply that
those who chose the film did
so for that. purpose. intended
or not, is grossly unfair.

The suggestion to screen a
future film or cartoon, and
not Show it if lls contents
may not please everybody.
amounts to prior censorship.
I definitely believe that prior
censorship has no place on
this campus.

Any film cannot. please

everyone If you Eel-W the
film. and felt insulted by
“poor taste” afterwards.
remember. you could only
have come awav with that,
feeling by seeing the film in
the first. placeamd that was
because there wasn'ta small
group of people screening
films. deciding what
everybody should and
should not be able to see.

it someone wants to do
something about the movies
shovt'rn on campus. then that
person ought to volunteer to
be on a. movie committee for
next semester.

The SUNYA Ripoff

by Tom Tortoriei

The term “rip-off“ is basically
American in origin. It first came
into use in the mid-l960's to ar-
ticulate what the nasty political
and commercial bureaucracies
were doing to all the peaceful.
nature-loving rind altruistic young
people ofthe era. Well. to make a
btiririg story short. the earnest
yotithfreaks finally decided that
the only way to “get back at the es-
tablisliment" was to to first form
some sort of a union. ti
brother/ sisterhood, The so-called
subculture that resulted went
through all sorts of weird changes
for a while. but its music. books
and leaders ne\er let the people
forget that they were constantly be-
itig exploited by tiiaterialisrn. war.
and false ialties. It was about this

WHY‘.’ ln I973. these naive youths
cannot answer such questions. It
seems that their sickly justified
brand of buccancering has
somehow become almost ‘faddish‘
in its general popularity and. alas.
no veritable end is in sight.

All right. examples. An indepen-
dent (very independent) research
firnt reecently made a study of the
amount of lobby and lounge fur-
niture that could be found in
privatcsuitcsand dormitory rooms
on campus. The results of this
study were never published. but the

'rccommendation made HllCdECdll’
suggested something to the effort
of “...chaining lounge armchairs
and sofas to ltiunge \salls." The
proposal then went on to outline
the simplest and most secure
methods of doing so.
