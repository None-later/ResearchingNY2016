 

 

First there was Brian's
Song. a poignant. true story
of the friendship between two
football players. one of
whom was dying. Now there
is Bang the Drum Slowly. an
intelligent.poetic portrayal
of a similar situation.

The afflicted player is
Bruce Pearson. a third-strin g
catcher on the fictitious New
York Mammoths. His friend
is Henry Wiggen. an all-
American Tom Seaver
prototype. Immediately, we
learn that Pearson. a
backwoods country boy. is
dying of Hodgkin‘s Disease.
Realizing that a player of
Pearson's marginal - ability
would be released by the
team if his condition should
become known. Wiggen
resolves to keep the matter
secret. Indeed. he forces the
club to agree not to cut Pear-
son. as a clause in his own
contract. Bruce Pearson's
steady deterioration makes
it impossible to hide the truth
as the season progresses.

This is a multi-faceted
film. There is poignancy. yet
there is also humor. and

Bong the Drum Slowly

satire. Much of the satiric
aspects are directed at the
components of baseball.both
as a game. and as ametaphor
for life‘s wider spectrum.
The acting performances are
fine. Robert de Niro. as Pear-
son is essentially an anti-
hero. One feels sympathy for
his plight certainly. less for
him as an individual. He is
far from the near flawless
image of the doomed
protagonist. He is minimal-
ly intelligent: incredibly
naive. He knows that he is
dying. yet he cannot quite
understand why. Outwardly
courageous. he fears death
greatly. Pearson drifts
toward the end cognizantly.
yet ultimately unable to
grasp the essence ofthe“shit
deal" he has been handed.

Henry Wiggen. sensitively
portrayed by Michael
Moriarty. gropes desperate-
ly for a pointof reference. for
meaning in this most tragic
of situations. as he attempts
to make his friend‘s last
weeks more bearable. At the
same time. he is in the posi-
tion of preventing unknow-

Old Lem on- New Twist Chaplin At The (Circus

by Patricia Maud

If it's flair. a new twist
to an old lemon, 8. little
humor to stifle your
boredom that you’re look-
ing for. go see the City
Center Acting Company.
Their three day perfor-
mance this week was
quite the debut. They
began with Anton
Chekov‘s “Three
Sisters". seconded it with
“Beggars Opera”. by John
Gay. and for the grand
finale they did a
marvelous skit with
Shakespeare’s “Measure
for Measure".

The Company‘s produc-
tion of “Three Sisters"
was one that will be long
remembered here at
3.U.N.Y.A. The script
was superny rendered
and realistically por-
trayed. The touring com—
pany. being directed by
Boris Truman. utilized to
the fullest our theatre
facilities. Movement on
stage was well cued. keep-
ing audience attention
focused on the main
characters while
assisting seconds in
spatial variation for
effect. The utilization of
triangular placement not
only of actors but props
as well. added dimension
to characterizations.
Location seemed to
provide clues through
which the audience could
deduce possible under-
mining relationships
betwixt characters.

All three presentations
seemed to add more com—
edy than perhaps
originally was intended.
butitwas done quite well.
In “Measure for Measure“
the usage of the carny-
type characters. slapstick
comedy routines and
costumes kept the play
alive. Sam Tsoutsouvas
was as hilarious as Lucio
as he was ridiculous as
Captain Solyony in
“Three Sisters". David

Ogden Stiers was
probably the most ver-
satile actor on stage. He
played not only the dim-
witted teacher F‘uodor but
the noble Duke with sueh
off-handedness that he
never ceased to astound.

Costume and setting
was appropriate. Other
than the seeming
bleakness deemed fitting
to the Shakespearian
play. settings and
costumes were given the
finest of treatment by
Douglas Schmidt and
John David Ridge. respec-
tively. The starkness of
the backdrops coupled
with the furnishings of
the households sent us
whirling backwards in-
time. deporting our com-
pany at Yalta. summer
home of the Chekov fami-
ly.

The usage of the double
stairway and loft in
"Beggar's Opera“ and
“Measure for Measure“
was used skillfully by
performers. The make-up
and seatings of the ladies
of the town kept us
laughing. The flag-
waving. whore—bounding
theatrics of Gisela
Caldwell. Cynthia Her-
man. Patti LePone and
Mary Jane Negro added to
audience response a tinc-
ture of Elizabethian color.

The lighting of Martin
Aronstein greatly
enhanced script inter-
pretation. I particularin
enjoyed the subtle treat—
ment given to the plays by
slight dial adjustment for
dramatic effect. The usage
of a hollow echo in the
third act is as was first in-
tended and heard.
Lighting of the portrait of
the sisters in the burning
province was as poetic a
rendition as possible on

.I

stage. It gave the strobe
effect of an epic piece of
D.W. Griffith silent film.

There is little more that
I can praise without seem-
ing pretentious. Direction
and .choreography.
dancers and musicians fit
the demands of produc-
tion based upon the
variable of time. The
Cossack dancing of Ben—
jamin Handrickson and
the members of the
Prozorov Household. the
acrobatic—direction of
Gene Lesser and the
graces of Leah Chandler
leave our beloved
playwrights a just ado.

Albany State Cinema will
screen Charlie Chaplin‘s
1928 comedy The Circus on
Sunday. Sept. 80.

The Circus was made at a
time of severe personal
problems for Chaplinxhis
mother became ill. and he
was going through adivorce
from his second wife but
these factors did not seem to
affect‘his work. The Circus is
reminiscent of Chaplin‘s
earlier films. Fast—paced.
imaginative. with only a
touch of pathos. it is
Chaplin‘s most light-hearted
feature.

One of the last great silent
comedies. The Circus was
made just as Hollywood was

frantically converting to “all
talking. all singing. all dan-
cing” pictures. In the first
ye er of the Academy
Awards. the Academy of Mo-
tion Picture Arts and
Sciences honored Charlie
Chaplin with a special award
for “Writing. Producing.
Directing. and Starring in
The Circus."

In 1970. Chaplin composed
a musical score andwrotea
song for The Circus. and
mounted a world-wide
reissue of the film through
hisoldstudio.UnitedArtists.

The tremendous response
to the forty year old film
proved Chaplin‘s artistry
to be as
as GVBI'.

Yes, there are a lot of
good reasons for women

 

to quit smoking.

Find yours.

( ) That “Smoke Pretty" ad makes me furi-
ous. Whoever made that up knows where the
money is—fewer women than men are quit-
ting. But they won‘t get rich over my dead body.
( ) My closet smells rotten. my clothes smell
rotten; I'm sick of it.

( ) Lung cancer deaths are twice as high
among women who smoke as among those
who don’t.

( ) I’m still young. The longer I smoke. the
harder it will be to quit and my chances of be
coming a real heavy smoker go up.

( ) It's one kind of air pollution I can do
something about. People in the room with me
shouldn't have to breathe dirty air.

( ) I want to be a teacher. How can I dis—
courage kids from smoking when I smoke?

( ) I seem to be sick 8 lot I also smoke a lot.
Women who smoke like me have more chronic
illness. lose more time from work, are sick
more often than those who don’t.

( ) I know my father's been trying to quit.
How can he with me still pulling away?

( ) Iwant to wake up feeling fresh and clean
again. I've had it with nicotine hangover in
the mornings.

( )'Ihc thing that appeals to me most is:
If I quit and stay quit. in most cases. it can be
as if I never sinokcd.’l‘herc‘s something about
this that absolutely knocks me out. A clean
slate; at real second chance. You just don’t get
many of those.

( )I quit once for 10 days and. frankly,
I felt pretty good about it. I like that feeling;
this time I’m quitting for good. Lord knows.
I’ve done a lot harder things in my life.

( ) So many people I know have quit. I‘m
beginning to feel stupid about smoking.

( )Therc’s something very cool and self-
assured about women who don't need
cigarettes.

( ) I thought it was hopeless; I quit once and
went back. But someone told mea lot of people
had to quit over and over before it took. I’m
trying again. It can't hurt.

( ) If I quit. I'll save 50¢ a day. That's $3.50
a week. $14.00 a month. $182.50 a year. That
buys almost 2 gallons of gas a day. A record a
week. Seven movies a month. After a year. I
can fly toi¥_..,m._7#_and back on
cigarettes I didn't smoke.

( ) Somewhere in the back of my head I’ve
been nursing the illusion that smoking is really
only dangerous for men. We just seen the lat-
esi statistics.'fhe death rate for women who
smoke is more than 20% higher than women
who don't. We’ve come a long way baby. but
I'm not going any further,
Now all you need is help and encouragement.
Send a postcard today to: Women and
Smoking. Rockvillc. Md. 20852. And we'll
send some booklets to help and encourage you.
