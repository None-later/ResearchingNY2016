meet Saturday. Albany defeated
Montclair 25-36 and Coast Guard
I940. '

This is the first race that an
Albany runner failed to win.
Montclair's Tim O'Donahue. a
former lrish steeplechase cham-
pion. was the winner but Albany‘s
superior depth won it for them.
Nick DeMarco ﬁnished third a lit-
tle more than 30 seconds behind
the winner. Albany also ﬁnished
fourth and ﬁfth with consistent
Chris Burns edging Curt Wood-
cok. Carlo Cherubino clinched the
victory, ﬁnishing seventh.

Albany's next race is Friday at
Army along with Syracuse. This is
a match that Albany would dearly
like to win but is handicapped due
to the lack ofsharpncss of Albany‘s
best runners,Vincent Reda and Jim
Shradcr. It will be up to the depth
to pull Albany through.

The J.V, team finished eighth in
the Hudson Valley lnvitiational.
They were handicapped due to the
ineligibility of three transfers for
this race.

Back to back to buck to...'l'he
offensive line was great. the
defense tremendous. but the
most spectacular aspect of
Albany‘s recore—breaking 69-6
win Saturday was the
backfield. The Danes rushed
for roughly 565 yards. as seven
Great Danes ran for t\\ er fifty
yards each.
