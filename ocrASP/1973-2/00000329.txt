Editor's note: Thefollawr‘ng was
presented by Dr. Morris Finder to
the Committee an Outstanding
Teacher Awards. of which he is a
member.

I move that our committee
whose aim is to Identify teachers
deemed outstanding must assure
the university community that
their efforts are gutded by prinv
ciples that do not encroach upon
the full freedom of teaching and
that do not violate the first princt-
ple of evaluation. My Inquiry
shows that these princtples have

been disregarded by our com-
mittees to Identity outstanding
teachers with the result that

although our university has been
anardtng poles to such teachers.
the university community has no
assurance whether
these teachers ha\e learned
anything. let alone whether they
have learned anything vvorth lear-

FRIDAY, OCTOBI‘ZH ‘1 l '.

 

by Doug Horwitl

Hubert Humphrey. in a speech
before a receptive Freedom Forum
audience last Monday night,
declared there is a direct relation
between American national securi-
ty and the present food and fuel
shortage. “We are an unplanned
society," he stated in his speech in
Schenectady. This lack ofplanning
is one of the major reasons that
America and the world are ex-
periencing a severe shortage of fuel
and food.

Humphrey pinned much of the
blame for shortages on the afﬂuen-
tial tendencies of many of the
Western nations. Americans. he
said.“are gluttonswhenitcomesto
fuel.“ Humphrey noted that the
fuel shortage exists even though
American refineries are working at
full capacity. 'I'herclorc.
Humphrey suggested. American
must incrcnsc its efforts towards
finding more sources ot cnetgy.
whether It be solar or nuclear. I he
Senator was careful to stress that
preserving IItItIiIal environmental

 

conditions is a necessity. lltc iti-
div IdiItIl role. he said. is also Impor-
lattt in conserving vvhiit ithtittth

energy is left.

Humphrey cited that the world
critical food shortage in the world
today is enough to account for a
lack of national security in
America. He said. “People will
fight for food. they have to have it.“

The Senator offered the follow-
ing evidence in support ofhis belief
that unless something is donein the
near future. a world economic
depression will occur. one which
would probably be. “an in—
convenience for us. disaster for
others." Over the years the United
States has produced surpluses of
food that have fed millions abroad.
but due to a number of un-
dcsircablc factors. thos'c millions
are facing starvation.

For instance. meteorologists
have predicted that it twenty-year
cycle ofdroughts‘and floods will be
upon the United States and [lit
world Very soon. The el'lccts of
such natural disasters has already
been experienced iIt many Icgions
around tltc vsorld. In addition. tltc

HHH Wants Food Planning

Humphrey suggested that an
“international food surplus hank"
be established that would begin
with the top priority of fccdingthc
nations of greatest neeed.
Humphrey pro posed that it similar
“food reserve“ program should
begin in the United States.

Placing corn. wheat and
soybeans on reserve. would help
relieve market prices when they
reach “skyrocketing” proportions.
This. Humphrey stressed. would be
of importance to both consumer
and the nation in terms of national
security. for when there are food
shortages there is no national
security. A program calling for
food rcserv cs might also help
eliminate economic disasters as a
result of large food exports such its
tltc Russian wheat dciil. According
to Humphrey. that particular tran—
saction alone cntpticd tltc gratntiry

the SUNY budgetary system for
operating ina waythatdiscouragcs
academic departments from using
media facilities to achieve greater
productivity.

A third contributing factor to
underutilization of SUNY
educationle television is the lack of
an adequate faculty reward system.
The report charged SUNY with
failing to recognize television
teaching as valid criteria for
promotion. Nor. it added. does the
SUNY copyright policy encourage
work on instructional television
because the policy gives control
and ownership of television tapes
