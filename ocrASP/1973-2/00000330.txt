When this 25-year-old researcher

wanted to investigate a possible cancer treatment,
we gave him the go-ahead.

We also gave him the rightto fail.

and nvc him the go—ahead. He built two half-billion

National Institute of Health. '

The lasers proved unsuccessful in treating cancer, but
we'd make the same decision all over again. We entered laser
