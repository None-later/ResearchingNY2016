by Mitchel later

So here it was, the first real vaca-
tion of the year. True, there was
Labor Day, but thatcomes when it
is still sweltering and T-shirts and
shorts are worn and the days drag
on because they‘re long and hot
and you have little work and it
should still be summer. this must
be a dream. and after these three
days it will allvanish likea mirage.

But when Tuesday came.
everything was still there like we
left it. At least the crispness of air
also came. to turn the underripe.
unfamiliar taste of classes in the
summer into the sharp, comforting
taste of classes while the leaves fall
(a taste that's been with you since
you were six and in first grade and
is called the start of the "season"
once we finally leave school).

There is a definite sense of in-

irite Relativist
in Residence

To the Editor:

After reading Ms. Glickman‘s
article on the downtown dor-
mitories, l was appalled to find out
under what conditions lam living
under. Being a resident of Water-

decision that falls on campus. in
one of the few substantially sized
ekoduses that doesn’t quite know if
it should be occurring.

For one, the dorms remain open.
There is not any other four-day
weekend which has this condition
(of course four days is not that
NUCh) but it is as long as
Thanksgiving. and the resulting
three day week has tremendous
psychological power in the ability
to persuade us to shear off one or
two unnecessary days of classes to
make the four days seem a lot
longer.

Not having the tradition of
returning hoine for at least half of
us (in fact. being completely void of
tradition for about half of us) if
offers the only autumnal oppor-
tunity to go to Boston or New
Hampshire. or wherever you can

friendship to paraphrase
Ms.(i|ickinan. I don‘t believe the
people downtown are more friend—
ly than their counterparts uptown.
Friendship is something that com-
es from the individual and cannot
be propagated froin anopendoor.

(irantcd minor inconveniences
do exist, lripled rooms and im-
proper \cntilatioii to name a few.
But uptown students in their white

 

 

share expenses to.

Conversely. the length and lack
of destination can be great motiva-
tion to simply have two more days
of partying (or. perish our
thoughts, study).

It‘s probably the easiest time to
get a ride home. or at least toward
or to New York City. For one
fleeting week there actually
materialize Riders Wanted tickets
on the Board which are not all
filled when you call.

Actually, with it virtually perfect
timing this year, the further pur-
pose was served of a catch-up
period for all those forgotten
readings that piled tip in H3 of a
semester. Yes. unbelievers, 1/3 of
the semester is totally behind us. It
boggles the mind, how much time
can be wasted when you really are
trying.

 

tinuing possibility of power shor
tages we each have a responsibility
to consider means by which such a
situation can be avoided. In-

personal consumption of electrici-
ty but what of the real offenders-

Quotation of the Day
I think it's about time Mayor Corning came out with
some substantive answers to the questions brought
about by the SlC... c". Tom",
Mayoral Candidate

'COrruptian On High...

The Press in the United States today has the unique opportunity it not
obligation, to play a decisive role in the cleansing of an Administration
thoroughly riddled with corruption in the highest levels of office. Thems-
closure byAssistant Attorney General Henry Petersen that Vice Il rcsiIdcni
Agnew‘s sordid history as Governor of Maryland ISIHOW under investiga—
tion. with the possibility of impeachment andor indtctment a very distinct
one. should therefore by a cue to the Press to continue its thoroitgttjoh oi

investigation.

One must remember. that on viewing Agncw‘s recent history. it tlhtllttttls
in denunciations and censures ofthe Press. One man has never before ttlkcri
it upon himself to singly seek to discredit and destroy an ll‘lSlllIUIllIilll such its
Mr. Agnew tried to do two years ago With his scathing criticism of lllt'
"liberal" Northeastern newspapers and television stations. it then must
come as no surprise that in air Administration on llIch brink of partitiqu to
again accuse the Press of denying Mr. Agnew a lair hearing betore ilii~
American Public. Henry Petersen's disclosures to the press should beconi
mended as the real defense of Constitutional rights. by now ll is tlll\|tll|\
that a irutli that the Administration doesn‘t like to see wrll ever he issued
from within its hallowed halls. It is then concoinmitaiit upoIn men ot cttn~
science like Petersen and men of responsibility such as those iii the l'l'C\\Iii
continue their defense of the rights of the American public to know.

We cannot let the Nixon Administration. which from inception was bu»
ed on projecting images of men that didn‘t exist. from casting Agncw in lllL'
light of innocent underdog; victim of the vindictiveJustice l)Iepurtnietit oi .i
vengeful Press. While we cannot say whether Mr, Agnew is innocent. \i c
must certainly declare him no victim oftlic underdog syndrome of which lic
cries. Certainly Mr. Agnew has the constitutional rights that arty oiliei
citizen oftlie United States has. But we cannot let him declare. asliis
boss Nixon has done. that he is above the law of this country. and that tic
cannot be judged by the American people. btit only by the nebulous
"history".

The humani/ation ol' the Presidency and now it appears. the Vice
Presidency as well, begins and will invariably end on the pages Uli’tthptlllsl'
blc newspapers.

...And Low
Burglary. Larceny. Pilfering.

Those were some of the charges heard last week as former i\lhi|ll\
