WSUA Combats Apathy ‘

It is all to apparent that
apathy is a way of life at
Albany State. Rather than
cite the obvious manifesta-
tion of the “I don‘t care" syn-
drome: I will propose a par-
tial solution to the lack of
communication around cam-
pus. There- is certainly
enough diversity of interest
within this large community
that no member therein
should have to be ata loss for
people with whom to
promulgate a common ac-
tivity. However. we regular-
ly hear ouselves and our
fiends complaining “that
there is never anything to
do" WHY???

Largely because in an in-
stitution of this size com-
munications are very dif~
ficult; without the aid of a
mass media. What WSUA is
offering is its time and
facilities to any interested
individuals or groups who
have an idea to share. Ifyou
believe you are “into”
something that fellow
students could profit from
sharing...please tell us so.
The mechanism for the im-
plementation of this concept
is called MINI-PROGRAMS.
They are 3-5 minute presen-
tations that are integrated
into our regular program—
ming schedule. The pre‘
recorded shows will be
played every 2 hours on the
half-hour beginning at 7:30
am.

What should the content of
the programs consist of?

ruthenium smcr 

That is limited only by the
boundries of our collective
imaginations. Suggested
topics include (but are by no
means confined to) political
and cultural mobilization.
alternative new accounts of
relevant personal ex-
periences. academic or
philosophic dissertations.
original or non-original
poetry and drama etc. ad in-
finitum... Background music
will be available from
WSUA's extensive record
library.

This is a perfect opportuni-
ty for anyone with a casual
interest in radio to explore
their talents. and the poten-
tial of the medium. So if you
have any feelings aboutwhat
should go over WSUA's air-
waves. take an active role.
and put your ideas and per-
sonality there.

Anyone wishing to par-
ticipate in this com-
munications experiment
please get in touch with
Howie. WSUA‘s Public Af-
fairs Director. Leave a
message for me at the sta-
tion. (457-7317) or stop by our
studios located in room 320 of
the Campus Center. Please
keep this offer in mind if you
or your group have a
message to communicate,
feel free to take advatage of
WSUA‘s resources. Maybe
this will start the ball roll—
ing. so people can find out
where and how to get in-
volved. and we all can
broaden our horizons.

Chaplin and Canyon in The Kid

Before the relcttsc of THE KID
in I92l. Charles Chaplin‘s
phenomenal popularity and
acclaim rested almost entirely
upon his many short comedies. He
played a leading role in Mack
Scnnctt‘s I914 feature-length
production. TILLIE‘S PUNC-
TU RED ROMANCE. but had no
bond in the writing or direction of
that frcnctic opus which is much
more Scnnctt than Chaplin.

Chrrplin had made abortive
cplortttions into thc lcuturc-lcngth
form on two occasions In I915.
whilc working for thc Iissrtnay
company. he htrd stttrtcd produc-
tion on at film to be called simply.
LIFE. Howcvcr, tltc dcmund for
his short comedies forced him to
ubnndon the project. (mucbol'thc

and picccs from other Chaplin
comedies and additional material
not made by Chaplin. cvcnturtlly

SHOULDER ARMS was
planned and finished as a Iivc-rccl
feature in l9lll. Chaplin. however.
decided that it did not sustain that
length and cut it to three rccls
before releasing it to the public. (It
should be notcd that it decision of
this sort did not rcprcsent any
significant financial sacrifice; so

licult to undcrstttnd how this 0c-
currcd rrs thc milicu ol’ the film is
rcmttrkubly similrrr to thc |.ondon
slumsofChrrplin‘sownchildhood.
l'hcrc is no doubt more of
Chaplin's own cxpcrtcncc in this
film than any of his previous
scrccnpluys. In this rcgurd it rtrnks
with the much later l.|Mli|.l(iH'l’
