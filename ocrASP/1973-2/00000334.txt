as well as thejustilications for their
existence. The logic of granting
such roadway freedoms to the in-‘
dividual driver would be to grant
that driver the right to increasingly
jeopardize ""5 life of every
motorist he passes.

But what about products that

affect the consumer alone. without
infringing on the health of others?
Does the gov't have a right to ex-
pose and forecany remove com-
modities that when in his posses-
sion solely affect himself and no
other? If a consumer is aware of
“W inherent danger of a
product, then why should a
regulatory agency (like the
FDA be created to obstruct the
decision process and right to
purchase aspirins for his Excedrin
Headache Ill?

The answers become obvious
when consumers realize that our
free enterprise system isn‘t really
that free at all. The process of free
choice dwindles instantaneously
with the quantity of products and

the necessary information on the
market that each must include for
intelligent consumer; decisions.
Even when product information is
exposed by government, conﬂicts
still occur with industry. Then who
will have the ﬁnal say? If exposure
is the alst right permitted to our
Federal Bureacracy. thaen'in all
consumer conﬂicts, industry will
be victorious, despite false adver-
tising, ambigious and misleading
product waranties and deliberate
ommission ofinformation. lfthere
are no rules regulating industry
and actively protecting that less
than omni-intelligent housewife,
then who will?

Genuine consumer choice occurs
only when a full disclosure ofinfor-
mation is present, as well as com-
plete option ofalternatives to select
from. The basic presumption of
consumerism is that these alter-
natives will stimulate morc innova-
tion, which in turn will hopefully
lead to noteworthy product im-
prnvcmcnts.

The essential problem is making
a gov‘t responsive to the general
citizen consumer. and to abolish
or grossly limit governmental in-

tervention in the economy. With
WHOM big government will side-
the average citizen or corporation-
is the issue in consumer debates.
Judging from past prodigious per-
formances of our majoragencies. it
seems natural to react negativelyto
them and their huge, inflexable,
and insensitive structure. When
Federal regulatory in 51,-
tutions cannot even regulate suf-
ficiently their own organization,
then independent citizen involve-
ment becomes mandatory. The
currently intimate and secure
relationships of business in govern-
ment is an insult to American
Democracy and continues

to plague every public
spirited the citizen. Who
wouldn‘t despair with over 10,000
corporate lawyers swarming
throughout the city blocks of
Washington I). C. alone, lobbying,
bribing and subtly coercing
government officials

What then is the answer lor
responsive government? The best
method for correction is simply to
continucly challenge. monitor and
direct all government powers by
citi/cn involvement. Any grotip
possessing powers can‘t be trusted
indcfinitcly- government is no ex-
emption. Regulatory agencies by
theory act as a referee between iii-
dustry and government. But like
anything. they too react to pressure
and are susceptible to Itivortism
frorn either side. Historically,
agency ollicrals often have conic
from the very industry under
regulation and later became rdcn-
tilicd with the very interests in that
industry. Monetary bribes. the
promise Ul employment alter
government retirement. and those
“special hciiclits" ol product dis-
counts arc all extended to cor-
porate lavorilcs. Rut L'\t:ll thch
rcpulsivc activrties tircn't tin-
avoidable. II more people Writlltl
takc democracy seriously lt.\ cori-

tributing participants and less as
apathetic spectators, then possibly
our government would react
differently.

How important is the average
citizen; what is his potential to
direct the government? Consider
these examples of citizenship by
just one unelected, middle class,
and previously unknown in-
dividual:

-lt was Ralph Nader who, with
the assistance of college un-
dergraduates, investigated, over-
tyurned and pressured to restaff
the Federal Trade Commission.

-It was Nader who was responsi-
ble for the “Wholesome Meat Act
of I967", which standardized state
meat plants to Federal re-
quirements.

-It was Nader who established
the first auto safety act in
American history, “The National
l’raffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act", written when there were 5.5
deaths per |00 million miles of
vehicle travel iii [907. In 197! it
was 4.7. The result was thousands
of lives spared “969-70, H.000
lives alone), despite the increasing
amount of vehicles (4.2 annually. ii
vehicle miltige increase of 4.7 an-
ritrally).

If there is any lesson to bc lctir'ri-
cd from these arid many other
astonishing accomplishments ol
his, it is that the intli\idti;il still
counts iii our society. Our govern—
ment. regardless of its enormity.

The effect ofthese laws is to take
people with no special skills and lit-
tle education and deprive them of
employment. Who are these
people? Generally the young and
the black. As Congress has hiked
the minimum wage, unemploy-
ment among black youths has shot
up way ahead of their white
counterparts. In the early fiftiesun-
employment among white and
black teenagers was about the
same. Then, in the late fifties, the
minimum-wage rate was raised
from seventy—five cents to a dollar.
The unemployment rate of black
teenagers shot tip from eight per-
cent to approximately 20 to 25 per-
cent. For \vhitc teenagers. it rose to
