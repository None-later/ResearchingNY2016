rather than the divisiveness that
has afﬂicted the association for the
last six years.

Ever since I967. the year of the

C.I.A. disclosures, N.S.A. con-
gresses have have been the scenes
of angry confrontations between
the association's leadership and
disaffected radicals. blacks.
women. and gay students.

This year's congress started out
in much the sme way. with angry
attacks on Higgins and his staffby
blacks and women. One black stu-
dent struck Higgins and another
called him a racist and anthSemite.
At one point. the delegates voted
to call for the for the staff‘s
resignation.

But the congress ended with a
display of unity. with the delegates
endorsing the renewed in—
vestigations of the Kent State
shootings. amnesty for draft
resistors. the release of political
prisoners in South Vietnam and a
boycott ofGiillo winc because ofits
producer's refusal to negotiate with
