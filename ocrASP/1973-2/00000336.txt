“Disappointing.” That was the
one work uttered by a somewhat
upset Coach Scheiffelin after last
Wednesday‘s game versus
Hamilton. and with good reason.
The Danes managed a mere l—l tie
with the visitors. but more impor-
tantly. there were several glaring
problems in evidence, and they
have cast a shadow over what
might still be a bright season.

The simple problem with the
soccer team is lack of teamwork.
The talent is there. the togetherness
is not. It takes a super player to
dribble from the center line to the
goalmouth and score. and Albany
has a shortage of super players.
Perhaps it is the melting ofall that
high school talent into one pot
which is responsible for this
problem- each star is tryingtoout—
do the other one. and all that they

are succeeding in doing is playing
mediocre soccer. The word pass
has been struck from the team‘s
dictionary ILl'he classic give and go
play is non-existent. There is no
offense. _

This team has the potential to be
the greatest team in the history of
Albany State soccer, yet it is falling
on its face. The players have got to
get it together. and in a hurry. Now
is the time forcriticism. not like
last year when the team went l-6
before anyone realized how poor
the situation was.

This week the Danes are off.and
then they return to action at Cor-
tland this Saturday. (Speaking of
Saturday. it is merely Yom K ippur.
the holiest day in the Jewish
religion. yet the soccer and football
teams are both scheduled. Mycon-
gratulations to whoever is respon-

inexperienced.“

Picked as probable quarterback
for the Albany game is Mike
Anderson. a o‘ 1“ I90 pound senior.

Anderson look over the quarter-
backing duties for the last two
games of last season. The Eagles
offensive line will be anchored by
team captain Jim Mcl.oughlin. a
(i‘. IXS pound senior from Whitc
Plains. N.Y.. who will be playing
his lotirtli season. Mcl.otiglilin is
expected to sltll‘l at center. The

sible for that.) lfthe hooters can get
it together and play team soccer,
they can be winners. if not. they
will improve on last year‘s record
bya mere tie: l-l2—l. ltwould bea
shame if all that successful
recruiting went for naught. Unfor-
tuntitely. the outlook for the season
has become one bigqucstion mark.
A quick look at the game backs
this up. as Albany scored first. blew
the lead on a penalty kick on a
stupi‘diplay. and failed to take ad-
vantage of a ridiculously large
number of goal scoring oppor-
tunities. It does not even matter
who scored. and the outstanding
play of individuals like Bob
Schlegel is totally overshadowed
by the poor product. The word
from Coach Schcffclin is that
cliaitgcs will be made. The word is
really: Shape up or ship out.

Moran who will fill one of the
guard slots. Greg Czech. a senior,
has been tapped for fullback. The
team's second leading rusher last
season. Don Bruen has carried the
ball for lbO yards.

On defense. sophomore Dave
Kassler will be handing one of the
tackle positions, while Dave Russo
will take the other side. The
linebackirig corps will be led by
middle linebacker Felix Viccino
and outside linebacker Mike
Cavanaugh.

Cinncinatti‘s long period of
waiting is over as they finally have
an opponent in their attempt to get
back into the series, it is the Mets.
The problem that they now face is
did they lose their momentum and
do the Met‘s have too much
momentum to be stopped.

The-Red‘s. who lost last year in
the Series, put on a great stretch
drive to beat out the Dodgers and
ﬁnished with the best record in the
National League. Over the season
the Reds hold an 8-4 bulge overthe
Mets.

There is no doubt the Mets have
momentum. Sixteen wins out of
theirlast twenty is momentum.The
question is did the stretch drive
take everything out of them'! In
I969 they had enough left. ls this
another miracle year?

If pitching is 90 percent of the

game, then the Mets might
just have the edge if their arms are
not too tired. Tom Seaverr who
probably is the best in baseball. has
had some soreness in his shoulder
and also has had trouble in the past
with the Reds. Backing him up are
lefty‘s Jon Matlack and Jerry
Koosman. Both had losing records
but pitched the last six weeks like
twenty game winners. Another
starter who might move one of the
lcl'tys outisGeorchtonc.whohad
the best winning percentage of the
four.

Relief in the form of 'l ug
McGraw is always available. His
second half performance made tip
for his poor first hall which put the
Mets in the hole. Harry Parker.
Burl Capra and Ray Sadccki are
adequate back ups.

 

 

Reds-Mets

The Reds have gone all year
without one of their aces. Gary
Nolan. but the slack was picked up.
Jack Billingham pitched all year
like he did in the play-offs last year.
Don Gullct had one of the best
percentages in the league and Ross
Grimslcy had spots where he was
unbeatable.

The bullpen of Clay Carroll.
Pedro Borbon. and Tom Hall is a
lot deeper than the Mets but none
of them are equal to McGraw.

fielder in this even match-up.

Bud Harrclson is still one of the
top three defensive short stops. and
he‘s also hitting respectably. Dave
Concepcion was the Red‘s
shortstop and was having a super
year but he‘s hurt and Darrell
Chaney cannot hold Bud‘s glove.

Rookie Dan Driessan moved
out Dennis Menke by batting .300.
His defense is shakey. Wayne Gar-
rett has been "M r. Clutch“ for the
Mets and though he won‘t hit .300.
he has more power.

The Red‘s outfield is still shakey.
Bobby Tolan has been suspended
and won't see any action. Cesar
Geronimo will play center andhe is
a defensive gem but he can‘t bit
much. Andy Kosco will probably
play right. The big man is Pete
Rose. The League‘s leading btitter
