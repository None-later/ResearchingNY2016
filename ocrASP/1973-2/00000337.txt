all about. as Nichols College at
Massachusetts defeated the Danes

Nichols was perhaps the
toughest learn that Albany will face
this year. Going into the game. the
llisons were undeleated. beating
Plymouth State and shutting out
the University of New Haven. 'l’he
Nichols team was expected to be up
for the game as itwaslioinecomiiig

were themselves up Ior the game.
even though they lirid won the
previous week by sticli a large
score. But Albany met their old
nemisis. ftimblitis and could do lit-
tle all al'ten oon.

Coach Bob l‘ord called the game
a “Disaster.” chalking it tip as “one
of those days".

A look at the statistics will show
why it was a disaster. Albany

dominated the game with the (i reat
Dane (iround Machine rolling up
over 300 yards. The Danes were the
best team between the thirty yard

Israel Claims Arabs ' Routed 

Compiled from the AP

General David Elmr...the Israeli Chief of Staff...says that his forces have decimated tho-Egyptians in

the Sinai and all but wiped out the Syrians in the Golan Heights.

0n the Suez front.;.EIazer says that the stage of operations against the Egyptians have reached what
the calls the “mopping up" stage.
I Elazar also reports that Israel has launched its ﬁrst massive large-scale air attacks across the Suez.
The target, he says, is Port Said at the mouth of the Suez Canal. V

Israeli tanks moved up during
the night with fresh crews and were
taking the initiative on both the
Suez Canal front and against
Syrian forces on the Golan
Heights, Herzog reported.

EIaLar refected Syrian claims
broadcast by Radio Damascus that
the Israeli counterattaeks had been
thrown back. He said only a few
Syrians were holding out in the
Israeli-occupied territory. Elazar
did not go so far as the Israeli state
radio which said earlier in the day
that the Syrian army was “fleeing
l‘I disarray toward Damascus."
Syria‘s capital about 40 miles
northeast of the Golan Heights.

Egyptian Claims

Egypt said Israeli jets bombed
Port Said at the Mediterranean cn-
trance to the Suez Canal Monday
night. inﬂicting civilian casualties
in the first attack on a major city in
Egypt since the new Middle East
War began.

the Israeli military command
said its aircraft attacked near the
city throughout the day and that
the targets were missile batteries
and military installations.

"Ilie batteries were damaged
and put out ol use and the iri-
stallations were but“ ily damaged
an Israeli communique said.

Izgypi claimed its ranks punched
deeper into the Sinai today under
crncr from warplanes knocking
otrt \ital Israeli dclenses. Israel
said its forces were on theol'lensivc
and had destroyed all bridges
across the Suc/ Canal. trapping
lzgyptian troops in the desert
without supplies.

The Israelis pump about $350,-
000 worth of oil a day from Sinai
wells.

The earlier communiqucs from
Cairo did not say exactly how far
into Sinai the Egyptian forces had
gone since ﬁrst crossing the canal
onSaturday as Jews observed Yom
Kippur. the solemn day of judg-
ment.

The Israeli state radio said
Israeli troops and armor pursued
the retreating Syrians. The broad-
cast said Syrian soldiers were run-
ning away on foot and that Syrian
columns began withdrawing
toward Damascus. less than 40
miles from the battle lines.

Students Rally in Support

by Bob Mayer

Saddcned in the wake of the
latest Mid-East hostilities while
hopeful for whatﬂsraclcalled Mon-
day a “turning point” in this new
war, several hundred students
gathered in the Campus Center
Ballroom last evening for an
Emergency Meeting.

The meeting was called for by
the SUNYA Jewish Student Coali-
tion to offer a response to the pre-
sent crisis cngulﬁng Israel and her
Arab neighbors.

The goals ofthe meeting were to
provide a plan of action for
students in Albany. A plan that
would in some way relieve the
frustration that comes from being
thousands of miles removed from
the tragedy of a fourth war in a
quarter of a century for the Jewish
homeland.

CPCA Will Review Memo

In August of 1972 Vice President
for Academic Affairs Phillip
Sirotkin wrote a rricrnoraridumto
Deans and Department Chairmen
in which he declared that when a
tacirlry member has been con-
sidered in his mandatory year and a
ncgatiic decision rendered. the

ty. and was sent to the Senate's
(‘ouncil on Promotions and Con—

llie critics charged that Sirotkin
had no power to issue the
riiernorandum. and that it is the

It is the task of the (‘l’('A. they

Senate llooi directly alter the
meeting began 'l he bill risked the
Senate to "allirni i support lor
the policy on reconsideration of
tenure and promotions" enun-
ciated in the 1972 Siroikiri
memorandum.

Sherman argued that once a
negative dectsion has been
rendered. the University is under
“no Obligation" to undertake a
new lull-scale reconsideration til
the same case based on substantial-
ly the some evidence, merely

“because there are those who feel
the original decision was in error."

He also said that reconsideration
only increases the uncertainty
among university ol'ficuils over
how many teaching lines will be
open at the end ol the academic
year. making it more dilficult to
recruit replacements.

Student senator and Student
Association President Steven (icr-
ber spoke against Sherman‘s bill
directly after it wits introduced.
saying that the tenure policy
should have emanated lrom the
('I’('A. and that it is up to the
('I’CA to vote on whether they
agree With the Sirorkin memo. not
the Senate. as Sherman proposed.

Student senator “HHS likened
the riicnio to the gtiri issue which
doiriinatcd the Senate discussion

.itlniinistration “is coming to the
Statute alter lllc decision was
