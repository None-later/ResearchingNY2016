Students Mobilize Against Drug Law

by) AlSenln
SASU Press Service

The first organized student
protest group aimed at reforming
New York State‘s new drug law has
surfaced.

Three lthaca College un-
dergraduate students-AndchIsey.
Kenny May and Shawn Bennett.
have launched a campaign to im-
mediately lessen the criminal
penalties for possession and use of
marijtrana within New York State.
Their eventual goal is legalization
of the drtig. The students say the
support they have received from
the 80 public and private colleges
they have contacted thus far has
been “ovenvhelming”.

ting as spokesman for the group.
explains: “One day a couple of us
had an idea and tovcrnight it just
blossomed. Every school \ve‘v'e
contacted has expressed support."

The students have organized the
state into l2 regions. selected one
school in each area as a coor-
dinating center for protest ac-
tivitics. and contacted student
government officials for their
cooperatioti. Among the SlINY
schools that will serve as regional
centers are the four university
centers (Albany. liulfaio.
llinghamton. Stony Brook) and.
‘I’clscy says. the State (‘ollcgc at
New ’aIt/.

'l elscy adds that an
organi/ational meeting will be held
at the ltliaca campuson October |2
to l4 where specific policy
decisions will he made. Every
school in the state will be asked to
send a representative.

tentatively. the students plan to
hold a November rally in New
York City as “a show of strength".
After the rally. they hope students
will return to their regional college
communities to work on fund rais-
ing activities and organized corti-
munity action aimed at pressuring
the state legislature “to reform the
newa passed law“. 'l‘heir aim is to
get over |ti0.tl0(l students to the
New York ('ity rally.

“It's an election year and we're
hoping the lit year old vote will
have a political effect (on the
legislators)". Telscy cxpla ins. “This
organi/ation is art offspring of the
antiwar movement...wc‘ve believed
we've learned from otir mistakes
and now we know how to work to
get things done."

“We started off at less than

But I think we're going to surprise
