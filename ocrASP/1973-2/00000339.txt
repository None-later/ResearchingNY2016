Chapel House .an oasis

by Doug Hour“:

A place to escape from the hustle
and bustle of everyday life is in-
creasineg hard to find these days.
This may particularly be true for
-those sttidcnts who reside on one of
the five crowded quads on the
SUNYA campus. But unknown to
many of the University students.
there exists a quiet and peaceful
hideaway only a few minutes walk-
ing distance from any point on the
uptown campus. Those who have
been to the Chapcll House are
aware of what this reporter is
describing.

The Chapel House isa beautiful-
ly styled old English manor house
built originally for Billy Barns, the
last Reptibliean "Boss of Albany"
(which speaks for the age of the
building). The btrilding was used as
Barns' summer home when part of
the campus was used as a golf
course. Albany State students now
tise the house lot it wide range of
actiyities,

Chapel House is located on the
wooded hill directly in back ofthc
physical education building and is
approachable from two directions.
l-or those who are walking. there is
a dirt and log stairway located
across lrorn the women's field.
which leads right to the hotisc. liy
car. the (‘hnpel llotisc may be
reached lrorti a drive entrance
leading out of the large parking lot

across from the gym.

As mentioned before. there is
always something going on from
the time the house opens (about to
in the morning) until the time it
closes iii the late evening hours.
Some ofthe activities include. yoga
classes Tuesday evenings begin-
ning at 7:00. a coffee house with
folk music every Sunday night at
8:00. Episcopalian services
Wednesday and Stinday evenings
at 7:00. Jewish Sabbath services
Friday and Saturday. and Chris—
tian services Sunday. A group of
seven people staff the Chapel
House. including Secretary
Dorothy Moreton. (Episcopalian)
Pastor Harold llaum. (Catholic)
Fathers Paul Smith rind Jim Stcur.
Sister Helene Mailcy. Ministers in
higher education (Baptist)
Reverend Andy Smith and
ll’rcsbytcrian) Reverend l'larvey
Bates.

Sereral programs are in the
planning stage. such as a medita-
tion room. and poetry hours wliiclt
ltopcfully will begin in October.
Depending on student response. a
Dylan Thomas Day is being eon-
sidcrcd lor‘0etober 27 to corn-
meinor'ntc the noted Welsh lyric
poct.

for those people who arelook-
ing tor-some peace and relaxation
or are just in the mood for rapping.
the Chapel House is there to use.

defeated. the Senate began con-
sideration of a bill proposed by
faculty senator DcWitt Ellinwood.
which called for the creation of an
ad hoc committee. appointed by
the Senate Executive Committee,
and charged with reviewing the
Sirotkin memorandum and
delivering a report to the Senate.
Senator (icrhcr argued against tbc
I‘iitlt\\t)tii\ bill. stating that if
another ad hoc committee were
or'giini/ed. thcrc woiilc be “too
many councils and committees"
discussing tenure-related issues.
arid that there would be
operational tlifficulticd in orgartil—
mg sticli a coirimittcc and deliver-
trig a report by lillinwood‘s
deadline ol December lst. (icrhct‘
suggested that either the SPCA or
l’r‘esidcnt Ilctie/ct‘s ad lioc corri-

mittec on tenure reform should
review the Sirotkin policy.

Speaking directly after (ierber
was Senator Shane. who argtrcd
that the President's ad line coni-
mittee should not be chosen
because it contains 50‘}? students. a
figure Shane appar'cntlr \tL‘\\'s as
being too high.

By voice vote the Senate lrnzrlly
decided that the CI’CA should
review the Sirotkin memorandum.
and established a Noverttber 5th
deadline for the committee's
report,

In its last order of business lor
