Cordiality was the opening
theme between the three can-
didates for mayor in a debate last
Wednesday night at the Institute
for History and Art on
Washington Avenue in Albany.
Unfortunately. the handshaking
and friendliness between incum-
bent Democrat Mayor Corning.
Republican independent Carl
Touhey. and independent Vincent
Bytner. was not present when the
debate ended.

Embanssing Questions

One fact that became increasing-
ly obvious and even blatant at one
point was that each candidate had
placed either two or more of their
supporters or members of their
family to ask embarassing
questions of their opponents.

The one blatant case was when a
man with a “Touhey for ‘Mayor“
button on his lapel questioned the
mayor rigorously 0 his ﬁscal
budget . bringing up disparaging
points of fact.

The question dealt with the
mayor‘s lateness in disclosing the
tax picture. The Touhey supporter

PLle ON YOUR NCW

asked whether voters would know
exactly what the budget was before
the election. To this question. the
mayor replied. "I will state the
maximum and minimum tax rates
prior to election.“

Columbus: ii Political Symbol

By far thehighlight of the even-
ing was M r. Bytnerhimself. His ill-
placed remarks brought about
tongue-lashings from both of the
other candidates. Butit was when
Mr. Bytner introduced a white-
haired man dressed in red velvet
clothing and a 15th century hat
with a feather as his "independent"
symbol that caused the audienceto
roar with laughter. it seems that
the man was to symbolize
Christopher Columbus and the
search for new ideas.

Said Vincent Bytner. “I‘d like to
say that if Carl would like to bring
his elephant and the mayor would
like to bring his donkey. l‘d be
thoroughly delighted."

All three. coincidentally dressed
in navy blue attire gavebriel' open-
ing remarks alter which the small
audienccolabout one hundred and
twenty-live people was invited to
trsk questions.

Bytner attacks Touhey

Mr. Bytncr. who runs a travel
agency on Central Avenue was the
first to speak. Reading all of his
statements from pieces of paper, he
directed the thrust of his attack on
Mr. Touhey and the Republican
party.

of the four judges. two
Democrat, and two Republican. it
was thetwoRepublicanjudges who
voted to throw Mr. Bytner off the
ballot in his bid for mayor because
his signatures had not all listed
their ward numbers.

Mr. Bytner said. “Apparently
the Republicans are fearful ol
rire.,.tind il Iweren't on the ballot.

 

some of the votes would go to the‘
Republican candidate.“

Mr. 1otihcy,who wasthe second
to speak. directed most all hiscom-
itients against Mayor Corning.
He spoke basically about giving
peoplethcirmoney's worth. exorbi—
lillll taxes. open bidding for city
coittracts. enlorcing the housing
code. and called for city-wide trash
collection I'orevcryone IiVingin the
city.

On closing his remarks. Mr.
l'ouliet said cuttingly. “I would
rieier want anybody to vote for me
loi tutor or Iear... that possibly
questions would be raised or his
wellari'e wotild hccut till it he didn't
\ttit: lor ('2rr1 lotihey."

Lastly. incumbent Mayor ( or
ning spoke. One til his inrrioi
points at this debate and .ri
numerous other times is the tat-t or
his consistency, Hc mod. "A. ml.
know. 1am running for Mtt_\ol on
the Democratic ticket. I not .i
Democrat. Mr.'1'otihe_v is I’tlllllltlt.’
on theRepublicanticket and he‘s .1“
independent. Mr. llytner is run
ning on an independent ticket and
he's ll Democrat."

Mayor Corning also \ptrLt
about his goals lor the ltlltltt‘
namely. the Ten 1-_\ck and \\ilIt'l
pollution projects. About thw-
projects he said. "I look Itll\\illti
and hope liltll l will he lll.|\iil m

Short of going to lsrael to aid in

consensus that students here could
help in other“positivc ways“. Jack

were here because they felt the
tragedy in their gut. Openning his
remarks with an anecdote that
would soften the pitch for money.
(iell'and told the story of the
teacher who asked students to say
the first things that came to their
mind. One child said “ice cream“
while another said something else.
and when Jackie ('oheri's ttirn
come he sriid. “‘I pledge $1,000.00“.
