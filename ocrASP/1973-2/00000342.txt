Most students have been ex-

statements of how it is thc“people“

posed to direct their government.

stitrrtional power. Most students
as well as these “people” also are
aware of the wide gap between
these civic textbook theories and
the reality of the American power
system. Why is there such an enor-
mous discrepancy here between
what should bc and what is prac—

Students are no exception. They

too often are victimized by unfair
price fixing, indiscriminate hous-
ing and zoning regulations,job dis-
crimination, ecological suffering
and and contamination and in any
other forms of social injustices.
Despite the fact that they can now
and later be manipulated by our-
sidc forces. they do have advan-
tagcs in confronting these forces.
For one thing students have oncof
the best opportunities for creating
organizations for the purpose of
actively participating in their
government. Students have the
necessary monetary funds
available to create tasting
organizations they possess the
greatest amount of idealism, am-
biion , imagination and flexibility
of any single group in society to-
day. ‘l'hey are the largest group that
usually comes first and closest to
understanding and realizing the
magnitude of many American
problems. coupled with a sincere
willingness to experiment on a
solution to those problems. Ihe
