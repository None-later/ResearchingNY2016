 



Regent Crltlelzes Nyqulst

 

The only: black member of the
Board of Regents has condemned a
ruling  the Commissioner of
Education as “a capitulation to the
virulent racism which con-
taminates the atmosphere in...sec-
tions of New York City.“ Regent

' Kenneth B. Clark thereby “public-
ly 'dis'a'ssociatcd" himself from
Commissioner Ewald B. Nyquist‘s
August 29 affirmation of “the ex-
clusion of black and Puerto Rican
children from the public schools in
District l8,“ Canarsie.

Nyquist's ruling upheld a deci—
sion by the City Board of Educa-.
tion which refused to enter minori-
ty group Tilden House children in
District l8 schools. The reason for
the refusal was “rapidly growing
minority registers“ in the schools.

Regent Clark charged that “the
Commissioner‘s ruling ignored the
fact that the constitutional rights of
these American citizens are per—
sonal and immediate.“ Clark re-
quested the other Regents to dis-

Sher   

sociate themselves'with the deci-
sion, but received the response:
“We are not dissatisﬁed with the
Commissioner‘s efforts to imple-
ment the Regents‘ policies."

Clark currently is helping
'NAACP lawyers bring the Canar-
sie situation before the Supreme
Court.

Watergate Course Offered

The Watergate scandal Is now on
SUNY Buffalo‘s list of academic
endeavors.

A new experimental course is be-
ing offered by the Political Science
in conjunction with the Law
School. and the History and
Philosophy Departments. The
course, taught by ﬁfteen faculty

members. is titled “perspectives on

Wateragte." .
According to Political Seience

Department Chairman .Iohn Lane.

the course is designed to separate
"the wheat from the chaff.“ The
problem with understanding the
Watergate affair is not the lack of

Seniors Not Much Different

An extensive survey of students
who were college seniors in I97!
conducted by a group of
researchers at the Educational
Testing Service has found that the
students’ basic goals appeared to
be pretty much the same as
students ten years ago, despite the
possible influences of social and
political upheavals of the past
decade.

As in the l960's. the survey
found. almost all the students still
felt the need for more formal
education, more than half reported
they expected to earn a Master‘s
Degree sometime in the future. and
more than a fourth hoped to earna
doctorate or equivalent
professional degree. .

The survey also found that cri-
couragcrncnt from family and
friends appeared to he the greatest
influence on a scnior's decision to
go to graduate school.

The report was based on
questionnaires completed by some

Sirotkin and theSenate

Midterm time is here and the
average student is busy studying
for exams, while faculty members
are, forthe most part. busy correc—
tingthem. Butlife outsidethe study
cubicle still goes on. There was
Agnew‘s resignation and there was
a new war in the Middle East.

On campus there were some im-
portant developments as well.
Members ofthe University Senate
challenged Executive Vice-
l’resident Phillip Sirotkin over a
memo he had written last year
specifying certain tenure
procedures to be. followed
procedures quite unpopular with a
large faction of faculty members
and student leaders. Ilis critics
challenged not only what the

Alumni House

Progresstng
A decision nirirlc by lhc lfni\ci-
ally Senate. in ii iccciil meeting,
was another step for the Alumni
Association in their crrriipaign to
build an Aluniiii llorisc. A niaJoii—
ty vote of the Senate passed a hill
enabling the Association to criti-
stt‘ucl a proposed Alumni House

on the University Campus.

The idea of an Alumni House
first came into existence about one
and a half years ago, when the
Alumni Association decided to in-
itiate an annual fund drive. Many
ideas were discussed concerning
how the money would be spent.
Scholarships and various other
donations were considered, but the
Association realized there was a
greater need. They realized thatthe
U niversity needed another place on
campus, other than the over~
crowded Campus Center. where
various activities and functions
could be held. This new building,
known as the “Alumni House",
would serve both the Alumni and
the student body as a conference
center. The Alumni House would
offer facilities for mcctings. con-
ferences. receptions. Alumni of-
ficcs. cdricution.
seminars: institutes, or inst a place
for the Alumni to come when they
are visiting the campus.

llic actual design and location
of lift: building is still in the plan-
ning stages. Ihc Iloard of I)ircc—
tors estimates that the building will
cost somewhere in the
neighborhood of $l75.tlflfl. As of

collected and in November. the

destroy any of the surrounding
foliage. Tentative ideas for the in-
terior of the building include a
large lounge or recep ion room, of-
fices, meeting rooms, and perhaps
a huge picture window that would
look out onto the rest of the cam-
pus.

This project is the first among
many future projects which the
Association planstoinitiate forthe
benefit of the alumni and the un-
iversity community. Speaking on

   
   

behalf of the Alumni Association.
Director David Jenks remarks. “It
is an effort on the part of the Alum-
ni Association in broadening the
University by reaching outwards
from the University and bringing

others in." Judy lr‘autz

CC Space Problem

Several problems have arisen
this year concerning a lack of space
this year. The Student Association.
ASI’. WSUA. and other student
groups with offices have an over-
crowding problem in the Campus
Center.

with its governing. Their offices are
used as meeting rooms almost daily
for ten or more people. The old
meeting rooms have long ago been
utilized for student activities. Since
these offices are used for that dual
purpose, it is not possible to con-
solidate them in order to create ex-
tra area.

space for student offices and

damage the surfaces.

The University originally was
not aware that the towers would
need periodic recaulking. The
problem first reared its head two
years ago when the oldest towers
started to leak. Livingston Tower
was the ﬁrst to leak. and was
recaulked last year. State Quad‘s
Eastman Tower was recaulked
earlier this year. Some leaks are
already appearing in Mohawk
Tower. which is onlytwo years old.
The University is charging that
since it has started to leak so quick-
ly. Mohawk has a deﬁciency in its
construction. and that the builders,
the Planet Construction Company.
should assume the costs. The Dor-
mitory Authority has put this
charge into a letter which I’lanet
has not yet responded to.

Mr. lluckhoffcxplaincd that the
buildings are composed of a rein-
forced concrete structural frame.
Onto this frame are bolted the out-
side panels. which are
prefabricated. TheJoints between
