UP: It is well known that the
Black and Puerto Rican Students
did not support you in the last elec-
tion, because the problems that
affect them were not articulated by
you. As President of the Student
Association what can we as Blacks
and Puerto Ricans expect of you’?

Gerber: As Black and Puerto
Rican students. you can expect me
and SA to listen. try to understand
the problems which affect minori-
ty students. and to work with great
efforts to correct these problems.

UP: Now as President are you
aware of the problems which affect
minority students?

Gerber: Yes. I met with Mr. Ver-
non Buck. Director of EOP.todis-
cuss the needs and interests of the
minority students. 1 was unable to
meet with EOPSA because they
had not elected their new officers
yet. I'm also hoping that I can in—
crease the communications
between SA and the student body
to the point wherein no student will
hesitate to call SA if he or she has a
problem.

L'P; (hung in the fact that there
is only a small percentage of Black
and Pureto Rican students on this
campus. do you think thataneffec-
tive FOPSA organization will be
able to exert any political influence
on this campus with or without
your support'.’

(jt‘rht'r: Yes. with or without my
support. if EOPSA is organized
and able to present their point of
view in the right form. they can be
influential,

UI’: Can EOPSA count on you
for any support?

Gerber: Yes. if I know what the
particulars are,

(’1’: Most minority studentshave
different social. political and
economic backgrounds from the
white students. It has been a fact
that most of the entertainment on
this campus is not geared to out
taste Do you have and plans to
remedy this situation?

Gerber Forced to Face Issues

Gerber: No, because the decision
of entertainment is not left entirely
up to me. But as far as a remedy is
concerned, the remedy must come
front two different areas. One area
would be through the political
arena. Another area would be the
recognition by the entertainment
committee to present programs
that will reﬂect the cultural needs
of the students.

UP: There‘s an absence of any
meaningful involvement of EOP-
SA in the Student Association
What do you intend to do about
this discriminatory situation?

Gerber: There is not much 1 can
do, ButlwillsuggesttoEOPSAto
organize them effectively so that
they elect students to the Senate. I
asked Craig Jenkins to give me a
list of Black and Puerto Rican
students. whom he felt would bein-
terested in working with SA. Craig
has failed to follow through on my
suggestion.

UP: This year the EOPSA
budget is 527.000. Thereisalso one
thousand H.000) EOP students. at
$64.00 per student the total
amount comes to 564.000. Now
EOPSA submitted a budget last
semester for 588.000. we were
granted 550.000. Also. over the
summer you and other members of
SA decided that $50,000 was too
much to operate the eighteen ([8)
organilations under EOPSA. so .
the budget was cut from 350.000 to
327.000. It appears to bc a habit
for you and your committees to
renegnnitscommittmentstoEOP—
SA. W'hy‘.’

(iwlwr: first of all. yourfacls are
totally wrong. The orignal budget
submitted by EOPSA was for $60.—
000 which EOPSA could not
justify. When an organiration or
club submits its budget to the
finance Committee. that
clubiorganization MUST be able
to justify each dollar it has re—
quested. At any rate Michael
Lambert. then President of SA,
sent a recommendation to Central
Council advising them to ap—
propriate 535.000 to EOPSA.

After carefully reviewing the
recommendation. EOPSA was
granted $34000. During the
summer SA waslorced tomakc ad-
juslmcnls in its budget to accom-

 

modate the basic needs of other
clubs/organizations within the
system and also to allow for the
organizing of new activities on
campus for the coming semester.

UP: Going back to my previous
question: where is the extra $37.-
000 going? Are there any
justifications for committing this
beastly act?

Gerber: Again. | assert that the
information you stated is incorrect.
First of all $l4.50 of the $64.00
mandatory student tax goes to in-
tercollegiate Sports. The remain-
ing $49.50 goes into SA budget to
operate the clubs/organizations
under SA which also includes
EOPSA. This is one thing most
students do not realize. and that is:
central Council does not grant
money to each club organization
according to the monetary value of
each student.

UP: It is the opinion among the
Black and Puerto Rican students
that there are some racist elements
within your camp: this is probably
why Blacks and Puerto Ricans are
having problems with your
organization. How do you plan to
deal with these elements to prevent
further polarimtion'.’

Gerber: As far as I know. there
are no mambers in the decision
making capacity in SA. who IS
overtly racist. This is a racist cam-
pusineveryscnse ofthe word. And
it would be sheer ignorance to say
that it does not exist. When I say
that there is racism on tbiscampus,
I say that because there is racismin
society. The society we live in
promotes racism. And what we
can try to do is campass racism on
this campus: make people aware of
this deadly disease and raise their
consciousnesses. It would be naive
to think that we are going to end
racism on this campus when the
structure of our society has built
racism and reverse racism into the
minds of people.

UI’: Is it possible at this point for
you to meet with a delegation of
Black and Puerto Rican students
to outline your programs and
policies‘.I

(jt‘rbt'r: Yes. anytime. preferably
'l uesdays or Thursdays.

Profs Report on China

A delegation of Chinese-
American scholars headed by a
State University professor has
returned to the United States with
a variety of new information on
medical practices in the People's
Republic of China. The group
spent 40 days travelling some 6.000
miles on a tour of hospitals.
research centers and medical
facilities in the country.

The 13 member delegation.
headed by Dr. Frederick Kao.
professor of physiology at SUNY's
Downstate Medical Center. visited
over 25 medical facilities in nine
major Chinese cities. The areas the
doctors discussed with their
Chinese hosts included acupunc-
ture. public healtlt programs. den-
tistry and Chinese herbology, In
total. the visiting group met with
several hundred Chinese scientists
and physicians.

Dr. Kao. interviewed shortly
after his return to the United
States. said the group observed “a
treasure trove of concepts and
techniques potentially useful to the
American phystctan.“

The \’l\|l(Jr5 studied a number of
new applications of the ancient
Chinese art of acupuncture and
reported that it is now being used
extensiiely to treat a variety ofdis-
ordersincludingdeaftiess. myopia.
glaucoma and schirophrenia. the
technique is also wrdely used to in-

due: labor and for oral surgery. in-
cluding routine tooth extractions.

Dr. Kao characterized China's
health care delivery system as
“deﬁnitely advanced in...delivering
up‘tovstandard primary medical
care to all members of society at a
low cost." He went on to observe
that “Everyone in the country is
now protected under some form of
lovr cost health plan which
provides complete coverage."

lhe visiting scholars also
reported that their Chinese
counterpzfrts are concentrating on
basic medical research. with the
cure of common recurrent diseases
like cancer. heart disease and
bronchitis as top priorities.

Prom an overall perspective. the
group found that the Chinese have
apparently successfully combined
the more traditional Chinese
medical practices with Western
techniques. Chinese herbs are often
prescribed along with antibiotics
for the treatment of ailments. Dr.
Kao said. and surgery is often
coupled with acupuncture
anesthesia.

The result. he said. is a anew
kind of "ecumenical medicine"
with good effect in clinical and
research areas.

lhe trip. was sponsored by the
American Journal a] Chinese
Medicine and the American Socie-
ty of Chinese Medicine.
