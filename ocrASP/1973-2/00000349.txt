The latest war in the Middle East is an exercise in insanity. We
,_I. have seen six days of bitter ﬁghting. and both sides are suffering
grievous losses. Men are dying in Israel, and they are dying in Arab
countries as well. They are dying for the same insane reason that»

men have been dying since time itself.

There is nothing to be gained from this war. The detente between
the Societ Union and 'the United States is threatened, as both sides
i find it necessary to bolster their allies in order to avoid an em-
I: . barrassing defeat. All that can happen as a result of the resupplying
2 l is that the war will go on even longer, and that the danger of the con-
I ‘ ' flict spreading will increase accordingly.

Ii ( , The Israeli bombing of Damascas and the Syrian bombing of an
r lsraeli Kibbutz are indicative of the even more hideous turn this war

To the Editor:

The Environmental Studies
Department at Albany State is
currently faced with an important
decision. On the one hand it can
stand proud of its achievements
and mold its program around the
ideals of its founders. It can exist
as an alternative program. one has-
ed on close student-faculty
cooperation and trust. This
philosophical base is fundamental
to the department‘s existence.

The other course of action is
really not a course at all. but rather,
a dead-end. The rationale behind
structuring a department program
inﬂuenced more by administrative
desires than by reasoned judgee
merit based on past performance, is
faulty. One suggestion has been
made indicating the need for a VIP

qualified, lesser known instructors
go unnoticed, than such a policy is
irresponsible.

Attempts to structure course and
department requirements will do
more harm than good. In my
mind. to structure creativity is to
limit it. The Environmental
Studies Department is inIexistcnce
today because of the unselﬁsh
dedication of students and faculty
enraged by the rapid degradation
of our environment. They decided
to explore the problems and epx-
criment with solutions. To a large
extent they have been successful.

I fear the department is headed
towards ineffectiveness. If it is to
be a showcase to the community, if
it is to bring prestige to the univer-
sity, let it do so through its
achievements and its dedication.
not through its structure or by its
hiring practices. The decision is
important for it will show the un-
iversity community that a depart-
