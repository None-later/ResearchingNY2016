ii, Miteirerr Zoler

Branching out in a geometrically
erfect semicircle were the ap-
roximately fifty hard-core
layoff-game spectators who
rammed into a corner of the first
001- of the Campus Center, the
edasteled television located at
heir focus. Streaming out of the
ides were the constantly in ﬂux
tandees who ﬂeetineg took in an
nning or. obviously late for a class,

:; only asked for the score.

Applauding in unison a barely

scratched-out run by the Mets, or

aughing at the omnipresent sneer
on the face of Pete Rose. this small,
but representative cross section of
not only the campus. but most of
the southern Hudson River Valley,
seldom seen

    
  
   
   

 
  
  
 
 
   

Totally reminiscent of I969, a
mass uplifting of spirits has taken
place, concurrent with the rise of
our home team through the stan-
dings and then their decent

"(although at this time, yet to be

 
 
 
 

resolved) showing in the playoffs.
Numerous baseball watchers

  
  

. have tried to analyse this in terms

of the short duration ofthe rush. or
be way it came, from a nadir of
uch seemineg devastated propor-
ions. Perhaps the means might

   
   

:add or subtract one or two grains

of sweetness to the end effect. but it

 

- truly made little difference. We all

 
  
 
  

would like to see a winner, and if

  
 
 

 the Mets had started out a house of

 

 

fire, their post-season praise would
not have been diminished, while if
they had fallen short. the sour
noises about Berra and the other
personnel would have begun again
in mid-season form.

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

But, of course. the happy fact is
j. that they did really pull it out dur-
 ing that hectic last weekend, and

 

 

    

 

 

   

most people are probably a lot
better off for it. These past two
weeks of baseball euphoria have
also been accompanied by more
than its share of dismalness.

The carte blanche given to
Agnew to investigate leaks in his
case was a fairly unexpected
development. While it surely com-
es as no surprise that Agnew would
like to destroy Irec PFCSS

this country. the fact that he
might now have the tools to make a-
few dents in it is not only surprising-:.
but scary. Dominating the news
though. was, of course. the Arab
Isreali conﬂict which has now
come back to haunt us. For the
past few days it has been only those
scanty and contradicting govern»
ment reports that have been more
eagerly awaited than the inning by
inning score.

For those of us who listened in
panic to the initial reports that
territorial losses had been sustain-
ed by the already meager holdings
of Israel, the games were a salve to
assure us that. perhaps in the end
things will turn out the way we
would like.

And for those who had no senti-
ment about the war. the playoffs

  

by the Middle East Committee of
Youth Against War and Fascism

Today, in the midst of the
ﬁghting, the latest fighting in the
Middle East, it is of the greatest im-
portance that progressive people
here not lose sight of the fun-
damental issues which have
described the Middle East conflict
for many years:

That the Middle East conflict is
not. and has never been, a matter of
religion or a question of Arab ver-
sus Jew. Golda Meir and Moshe
Dayan are not fighting for the
Jewish people who suffer from un-
employment, racism. poverty and
war under the Tel Aviv regime. In-
fact. the Israeli government was
one of the first countries in the en-
tire world to extend diplomatic
recognition to the fascist and anti-
sernitic Chilean military junta
which today is rounding up.
arresting thousands and ex-
ecuting hundreds of Jewish

progressives. Thejunta has actual-
ly permitted the Chilean daily

newspaper El Mercurio to broad-

cast the threat "there should be a
Jew ha rrging from cverylamp post."

That the Middle East conflict
has always taken the form of a
deliberate campaign against all of
the oppressed in the Middle East
specifically Palestinian and Arab

Eng 313:

people. The Palestinian people
were driven from their homeland
and have been subjected tomany
years of 'bombing, detention, dis-
ease and poverty. The Arab people
of the Middle East have been killed '
or maimed, their homes reduced to
rubble, their lands occupied with
the help of U. S. - made
napalm.chemicals and bombs used
by the Israeli military.

That the main responsibility for
the Middle East conflict has always
rested with the very same military
and economic forces and interests
which unleashed the‘bloody con-
ﬂict in Southeast Asia. U. S. big
business. and particularly the ma-
jor oil companies and the U. S.
government which protects them.
The oil in the Middle East is more
plentiful cheaper and easy to get
out of the ground than anywhere
else in the world and so the Profits
to the U. S. oil companies which
control the oil wells in the Arab
countries are astronomical. In fact
the annual proﬁts are nearly three
billion dollars to U.S. oil com-
panies from sales of the Middle
East oil to Europe and Japan and
represents half of the total return
from all U.S.forcign invertmcnts.
Israel is the most reliable battering
ram US. big-businesshas in order

to punish any Arab country which
dares to try to take control ofthese

Group Speaks Against War

oil resources from the filthy rich
foreign oil companies. And so the
US. government, which allowed
Jewish victims of Hitler‘s death
campsto perish during World War
11 rather than permitting them to
emigrate and escape to America.
does not give Israel billions of aid
in Phantom jets and other military
hardware out of humanitarian con-
cern for the Jewish people but out
of a greedy concern for oil profits.
In their greed to acquire and main
tain control of Mid East oil and
other resources, U.S. big business
has done everything from helping
to overthrow progressive
governments as happened to the
Mossadh regime in Iran. following
an oil nationalization there, to sen-
ding the Marines as they did to
Lebanon in 1958 in order to rescin-
the regime of one of their iillIL'\
there who was about to bc
overthrown.

All progressive people should
support the just struggle of thc
Palestinian and Arab pctiplcs to
gain control of their land rind
resources and to build ii llt't'
Palestine where all its pcoplc.
Arabs rind Jews. can live Ill pcltt’c
andjustice. This is the orin sold
tion to the conflict in the Mltldlt'
East.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

FRIDAY. OC'I'OBI'IH I.', 1 tr

 

Amerika

by Nancy Miller -

The 1973-74 Experimental
Theatre season got off to a
rather inauspicious start
with the staging of
"Amerika: An Evening of
Song and Dance" this past
weekend in the Performing
Arts Center's Lab 11 Theatre.
The format was that; of the
durable musical review and
the result was the
anthologizing of some of the
best that. the popular and
show music traditions have
to offer.

But. the difficulty with the
show lay not in the format.
but, in its essential lack of
substance. Although the
enseinble‘s self-professodin-
tention was to present the
cultural differences among
the "people. ideas. and
traditions“ of Americans. it
did not, succeed in conveying
this vision to the audience.
The selections seemed ar-
bitrarily chosen and the
order in which they were
presented lacked thematic
coherence. Because of these
basic deficiencies. the show
lacks a curtain intens-ty and
the momentum which is so
essential to a good theatrical
performance.

Good Open Air

The fourth annual "OCLOUCY
sing" will take place on Stirr-
day afternoon, October 14.
from 2:00 to 5:00 on the Alta‘
mont Village Green. Spon-
sored by It‘AC'l‘ a human-
i'clritroiis organization
whose initials stand for I'l“l)l‘

drews. .Ioiiii Mullen. Maxine
Wriirko. Pete and Dottie
Spoor. Greg Clarke. Del
Spolrr. Itick Itowluv and Jack

Falters

This is not. however. to
detract from the individual
porf’orrritinces of the players:
Jody Hiatt. Bruce
Kolfor'liouse. rind Debbie
Zusman. Singing in various
combinations the trio
brought to life such sen-
timental favorites as "The
Telephone Hour" (Bye Bye
Birdie). "There Ain‘t
Nothing Like a Dame"
(Sor‘th Pacific). and “Singin‘
in the Rain“ (which, contrary
to popular belief did not.
originate witli(A Clockwork
Orange). Especially effec-
tive was their sympathetic
rendition of “Mr. Bo
Jungles.” In addition. the
solos by both women“You
Made Me Love You. 1 Didn't
Want To Do It." and “My Fun-
ny Valentine" focused atten-
tion on individual talent
most favorably. One only
wishes there were more
choreography to supplement
some of the numbers.

The transitions front song
to song were achieved
smoothly. and the revue
proceeded rapidly to the up»
liftingr strains of the finale.
“Before the Parade Passes
