12.....N-N5‘? was a blunder.

Black must have overlooked
whites 18th move. The black
knight will be trapped on
QRS but whites knight on
QRB is defended by 20. N5-
87. In an attempt to activate
blacks king rook. 20.....N-N5
followed by P-KS and R-KBI
was tried. This however
weakened blacks king
knight and black had gloomy
continuations had he
attempted to keep the knight.
After this knight was gone.
white could give up his
knight on QRB for blacks
other knight and go into a
favorable endgame. After 44.
K-B4 white is hard pressed to
prevent 45. N-BS and 46. R-RB

South were having a bad
game that night. and needed
the slam to “catch-up". The

Tricks and Trumps

Lo and Behold! South is a
lucky man: the Jack holds.
Next. he cashes the two top
hearts and throws ol'fhis two
worthless diamonds.
South's nextduty was to pull
trumps and claim his con»
tract With 8 spades. 3 hearts.
1 club. Hut alas. as fate would

trumps on the first round.
With Htlll some hope lel't.
South led a small club and
played his King hopmgto be
able to next finch-so spades.
llut East would hour of no
such thing. He quickly
grabbed his Ace and played
back a club. South won but
eventually had to concede a
spade trick to l‘lnst‘s Queen.

It's a shame that the hand
was doomed to llllllll'l‘ after
the hearts bchavcd so nicely.
but south can easily llllllll

South should discnrd his two
clubs. Instead! When the bad
spade break is discovered. he
can reach dummy by playing
a diamond to his King

attempt-5 fails. South
again play on diamonds. and
thus finesse spades to claim
a handsome slum bonus.

we move off campus. that's
cool. but don't be so ignorant
us to believe that we no
