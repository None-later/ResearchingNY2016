Strange Story of Grey Owl,
written by his friend and
publisher. Lovat Dickson.

Grey Owl was known to
naturalists and adventurers
here and in Britain as a half-
breed (Apache mother). who
spent much of his life in the
Canadian woods trapping.
hunting and living among
the Ojibway tribe. His books
were considered to be to life
in the Canadian wilderness
what the Robinson Crusoe
story was to life on a desert
island. GreyOwl's lectures
were enthusiastically

received and he was
applauded as the
charismatic spokesman for

[)0 you ever have nightmares
about being buried under mounds
of garbage? Or of being locked in
the trash room of Livingston
'l owcr With the residents throwing
their day old (or semester old) ap-
ple cores. orange pccls. used
klecnexcs. unwashed tunal‘ish cans
and soggy tea bags (in you'.’ I do!

Solid waste is a large and smelly
problem. Every American (that in-
cludes you) produces about 5
pounds of garbage a day. Where
docs one put 2“) million tons of
garbage a year. especially now with
a nation-wide shortage of garbage-
calcrs'.’

Sixty per cent of lhlb garbage is
paper which can be recycled. You
can help by recycling your paper
waste. A program for recycling is
now being started in the dorms. All
paper except magazines. wax
paper and carbon paper can be
recycled. Use a two-basket system
where one waslebaskct or box or
paper bag is only for paper and the
olhcr for the rest ol your garbage.
When you lake your garbage lothc
llilhil room. you can also take your
paper and put it into the up—

 

propriatc place for recycling, if
your trash room does not have a
place for paper recycling. please
call me. Lynne Jackson. at 457-
8569.

If you are wondering about the
purple and yellow barrels lhatyou
don‘t see in the domis. they are for
can recycling. The reason that you
don‘l see them yet is that they are
Silli being painted. If you would
like to help. call the above number.
Any kind ofcanwill be rccycledex-
cept arosol cans. If. however.
someone should put garbage into
the barrels. the cans will not be
recycled because no one likes to
sort through melting popsicles or
gooey ice cream wrappers. Please.
just pul cans Into these barrels.

The problcmof solid waste can
be partly solved through recycling.
but it takes the help of everyone.
Please help end my nightmares of
destruction with the pleasant
dream of communin eco—
cooperation. Recycle your paper
and calls.
