Far Friim Over '

Associated Press TEL
AVIV AP ,- The new Middle East
war enters its sixth day today, but
unlike 1967, when the Israeli
military machine at this juncture
had decimated its Arab foes. the
ﬁghting is far from over.

“It is not going to be a short
war." Maj. Gen. Aharon Yariv, the
deputy chief of staff, toldnewsmen
Tuesday night. “The people of
Israel can expect no easy and

elegant victories. We will have to_

do a lot of ﬁghting."

It was a different story six years
ago on the dawn of the sixth day of
battel. The armies of Egypt and
Jordan were defeated. Only Syria.
staggering under punishing Israeli
attacks, still held out along the
Golan Heights. By nightfall it. too.
fell.

In the span of six June days.
Israel in lightning series of attacks
had destroyed more than 400 Arab
planes. many of them still on the
ground, set ablaze ior captured 500
tanks, killed more than 20,000
soldiers, and captured thousands
more. The Sinai Desert was a tank
graveyard as Egyptian soldiers fled
across the Suez Canal.

This time Israel's forces ﬁnd
themselves entagled in a savage
struggle against a stubborn Egyp-
tian army in the Sinai desert and a
determined Syrian force on the
Golan Heights.

Since the Arabs attacked last
Saturday. Israel‘s losses have been
high not only in tanks and planes.
but also in the lives of its young
men.

Israel‘s costlyl and complicated
system of fortified bunkers along
the Suez Canal. the Bar-Lev Line.
was all but demolished. The Egyp-
tians regained the entire cast bank
of the canal. driving the Israelis
three to IO miles back before they
could extahiish a newdefenseline.

But why wasn't the speedy
success of 1967 duplicated?

In a word. surprise.

The Israelis used it to victorious
advatage in 1967 with their pre-
emptive attack on the Arabs. On
the first day Israel won complete
aerial superiorityl
This time. Yariv said Tuesday

   

CAMPUS CENTER

night, thegovernmenthad made the
tough political decision not to
strike ﬁrst. He said the govem—
ment did not want to be hit with
new charges of aggression that
might affect relations with the Un-
ited States, its chief arms supplier.

But it was equally apparent that
the government was not expecting
the ‘Arab attack. which came on
Yom Kippur. the holiest day of the
Jewish calendar. Israel's front-line
forces were greatly out-numbered
in tanks and troops.

This time the Egyptian and
Syrian air forces also had the
protection of advanced Soviet an—
tiaircraft missiles, installed since
1967. Spurred by the humiliation
of their defeat six years ago. the
Arab forces also have been ﬁghting
better and with more fervor.

The Arabs are not shattered on
the sixth day of the new Middle
East war. and that in itself has
almost wiped out the shameful
trauma of the last war in 1967.

Whatever the eventual outcome
of the new fighting. just the fact
that the Egyptian and Syrian ar-
mies are still shooting today is a
source of cautious Arab pride after
six years of living with the taste of
humiliation.

On the last day of the six-day
war in 1967, the Arab armies lay
prostrate. their weapons
destroyed, their men dead or penn-
ed behind the barbed wire or Israeli
prison camps.

Israel had made a mockery ofthe
boastful threats uttered only a
week before by the leaders of
Egypt. Syria. Iraq, Jordan and
other countries. Sinai, thc (iolan
Heights and the west bank of the
Jordan River were lost. and the
Moslem shrines of East Jerusalem
were under the control of tlichws.

But as dawn broke on the sixth
day of the new war. the Egyptians
had a foothold in Sinai. having
driven the Israelis out of their first
line of defense on the Sue]. Canal.
The Syrians, who gave up their
vaunted fortifications in two days
in 1967. still were slugging it out
with the Israelis across the Golan

Heights.
