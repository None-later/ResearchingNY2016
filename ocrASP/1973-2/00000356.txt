by Kenneth Ardulno

Last Tuesday the professional basketball season started. Here is a quick

rundown on the prospects of the teams.
NBA East

BOSTON: The Celtics with Cowans. White and'Havlicek should take
the division. Their starters are fine but depth might be lacking. Another
question mark is can they beat the Knicks in the playoffs.

NEW YORK: The starting ﬁve is back even though Monroe is presently

‘ injured. The depth is there too. Age might be a problem but experience and

pride should propel.

"BUFFALO: With new faces MaeMillian and DeGregorio joining
McAdoo the talent is there. but experience isn’t. Lack of depth will be a fac-
tor. '

'PHILADELPHIA: Doug Collins will help but the team is still poor. No
:lg guy; no depth. lnevitably they will be better than last year as they can't

e worse.

Capital Bullets: The teamwork teamwork should be much improved.
Hayes. Unseld and Riordan are an impressive front. Clark will play all
year: Lack of depth and a new coach might hurt.

A I'LANTA: Maravich and Hudson are allstars. Bellamy is getting old
and no backup is in sight. I
Houston: Walker and Marin give a good offensive but Otto Moore is no

champion center.
. CLEVELAND: Carr and Wilkins are great guards but whatarcthey go-
ing to do for rebounds. Too many question marks up front.

West

CHICAGO: Love. Walker. Sloan and Van Lier are a tough four. They
seem to get enouglt out oftheirthrec centers. Depth is bettcrthan average.

MILWAUKEE: Jabbar and Dandrigge are scorers and the Big O is
healthy. If he stays that way theywill be tough. The benchis questionable.

DETROIT: Lanier is super but the rest of the team is barelyadequate.

K. C. OMAHA: Archibald would get even more assists if he had
somebody to pass to.

GOLDEN STATE: The key is Kevin Joyce. if he can runthe teamthey
should win/if not they won‘t be championship material. Barry. Thurmond
and Mullins are the central points with Russel off the bench.

L.A.: Without Wilt they are hurting. Smith is a decent but an inex-
perienced center. MacMillian's scoring will be missed. West and Goodrich
must score heavily.

PHOENIX; Hawkins and Scott are great players but too bad they don't
play as a team.

SEATTLE: Bill Russell must turn the team into a cohesive unit.
Haywood becomes the center but how good of support will he get.

PORTLAND: The run and shoot machine led by Petrie. Too bad
nobody plays defense.

ABA East

KENTUCKY: Losers in the play-offs. Gilmore and lssel are the leaders.
They do everything right but win the championships._

NEW YORK: Erving comes home and improvement should be obvious.
Depth lacking up front but starters unmatched. Is there enough basketballs
for everyone.

CAROLINA: Cunningham and CaIdWelI are tough but the league
catches up with them this year.

VIRGINIA: Without Erving the Squires are not contenders for anything
but last.

MEMPHIS or PROVIDENCE or whereever they are this year: Is Finley
still boss'.’ The team can‘t change until these problems are cleared up and the
team can worry about basketball.

West

INDIANA; 'I lie Champs an: back and are about due to win their division
for a change. '

U I All: [hey are gcttingoldsotltey will have to conserve energylor play-
oils.

SA N l)lI€(iO: I he uricoacliablc Wilt is now coaching. With him at center
it‘s possible for the newcomers to win it all.

DENVER: They are good but the div1sioii is too tough. Ralplt Simpson
leads them on.

SAN AN I'ONlO: Movtng front Dallas to San Antonio doesn‘t change
the team.

How can a hockey team lose one
of the top goaltenders in the NHL
and still be odds on favorites to
repeat as Stanley Cup Champs?
The Montreal Canadiens lost
goaltender Ken Dryden, who left
for a law practice, but Les
Canadiens should remain on top of
the NHL. Montreal has more
depth than any other team in the
league and should be able to
replace Dryden and some of the

' other skaters who jumped to the

rival league. Michel Plasse, Wayne
Thomas and Michel LIII’OCIUC are
tabbed to replace Dryden.

If Stanley Cups were decided on
paper then the New York Rangers
would probably have a shelve full
of them. Unfortunately the
Rangers Iiave failed to even win
once. Every year the Blticshirts
find another way to lose or come
up with another excuse for losirtg
other than that of choking. 'I'Eiis is
because there are no real
weaknesses on this team, Maybe
new coach Larry l’opcin can
turn pcrenial bridesmaids into
brides.

The Boston Bruins once again
face the same problem they have
faced in yearspastzlack of goalten-
ding. Right now Gil Gilbert is the
top netminder and only time will
tell whether the situation will im-
prove, There is also the question of
Pltil Esposito coming oft a knee
operation.

The Bullan Sabres have made
great strides in only three years of
existence. primarily due to some
smart draft picks. The big problem
may be dissention on the club as
many players don't get along Wllll
'72-'73 coach of the year Joe
Crozicr.

Last year was a disaster for the
Toronto Maple Leafs but this year
could be different. General
Manager Jim Gregory has com-
pletely revamped the goaltending
situation, getting veterans Doug

Favell. Ed Johnston and Dune
Wilson. If some of the Leaf rookies
can develop. then Toronto might
justsneak back into the playoff pic-
ture.

The Detroit Red Wings missed
the playoffs by two points last year
and probably haven't improved
themselves enough to make it this
year. The netminding situation is
still shaky. New Coach Ted Garvin
should ltave his hands full this year.

The most improved team in the
league this year could be last year‘s
big loscrs. thc New York Islanders.
With tlic nrrttal of highly touted

The Chicago Blackliawks lost

The big change for this year is in

ptimistic Danes Ready

by Harvey Kohn

Optimism is perhaps the
most appropriate word to
describe the feeling of the
Albany Great Danes football
team as they ready themselves
for game number four of the
1973 season, the opponent. be-
ing hometown 'l'lVal Siena
College. This attitude. which
has permeated all of the Dimes-
practices. is a direct result ol
last Week's slaughter lot a
highly-overmatched Niagara
University squad by the
ridiculous score of 75-9.

Commenting on the victory,
in which lltc Danes gained 583
vards. coach Bob Ford said:
“The first tinit played almost
fliitvlessly...l think the defense
was almost to the point where
we 'inislicd last year.“ But l‘ord
is also cautious. for he noted
with a ring ol dismay the ct-
cessivc number of luinblcs

not betaken Iightlv. in view of

these statistics: The Siena
quarterback. Skip Carte. has
amassed big yardage in the two
games thus far. throwing 52
times and completing better
than 50 percent of his passes.
He has four touchdown com-
pletions to his credit, while
neither Niagara nor Hudson
Valley was able to sack ltim for
a loss. Bob Dcnmcn lteads wltat

ning attack, while Jerry King
provides capable receiving for
Carte‘s passing.

Defensively. they are bigger
and stronger than Albany
State. btit do not possess much
quickness. which could lead to
their demise. The Danes intend
to run right at that weakness
with a running game with the
emphasis to the outside. where
speed is more of a factor.

depth of Siena. which could be
a key if several of their starters
who were injured in the last
game. a brutal, hard-hitting af-
fair which Siena lost. cannot
return. As far as Great Dane in-
juries go. John Cage. the big
running back who has looked
impressive since joining the
team‘ after transferring from
Syracuse. has a badly sprained
ankle which is currently in a
cast. Center Andy Lee is still
out with a knee injury. and
there are several other ailments
which may prevent some ofthe
Danes from playing at full
effectiveness.

Whatever the outcome ofthe
game. it should be quite in-
tcresting. especially since there
are few teams on the
Danc‘s schedule who throw the
ball as ntuch as Siena. 'l'hc
Duties will play their usual style
