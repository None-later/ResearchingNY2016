Journalism Second Field Offered

.A new second field in journalism
wrll be offered by SUNYA starting
next spring semester, it was an-
nounced today by William E.
Rowley, Department of English.
who has been appointed director of
the journalism program.

.He asked interested students to
bring their ideas for the develop-
ment of the program to a meeting
at 3 pm. Wednesday, Oct. 24. in
Campus Center 315.

Consisting of some new courses
and some offered regularly by
various departments in the univer-
stty. the program is being designed
to combine some training in jour-
nalistic writing, and some practical
work in the media. with a critical
study of the role of the media in
society. it is intended primarily as
partial preparation forjoumalistic
careers. but its courses are open to
other interested students. it should
help students planning journalistic
careers to test their interest and to
give them a “Second Field, Jour-
nalism“ listing on their transcripts.
which could help them getjobs. To
this extent. it will be vocational
education. but in a context of a
liberal arts education. For the se-

cond field. students will take it
minimum of IS credits in a
coherent selection of courses. at
least six of them advanced courses
(300 level or above. or with prere-
qursites).

There is only one requirement
for thesecond ﬁeld: skill in writing.
to  demonstrated by the end of
the junior year by submission ofa
substantial sample ofwritingto the
student‘s academic advisor and the
director of the journalism
program.

Core courses. with the spring.

Relief May Be In Sight 

by Glenn von Nostltz

The crowded conditions on the
academic podium may be in for
some relief if a plan now being
promoted by the Campus Planning
Ofﬁce is approved by SUNY Cen-
tral Administration

What Campus Planning is
proposing is the construction of a
l25.000 square foot building.
twice the size of the Social Science
Building. to be completed in l976.
and they are asking SUNY Central
to approve $400000 in the next
budget in order to conduct
studies. hire an architect.
and do engineering work. The most
likely location lorlllr: rcwstrticture
would be directly across perimeter
road irorn the campus lakc where
llrc licltllrotrsc was to have been
htrrlt. included in the btrrldirrg
would he oilicc and
classroom space for social scrcncc
rrrrd humanities departments.
although the space allocations are
not dciitritc at this time.

('nriipus I’lttnnrng. says that the
present campus was designed to ac-
cotnodatc l0.000 sttrdcntsrrnd now
holds H.000. Although enrollment
was originally projected to reach
20.000 by Whit. this has been
reduced in H.000 and it is still im-

told that we still have enough

According to the Assistant
Director. we are “now at the ab-
solute limit“ and “can go no
further.“ Because of this severe
overcrowding he feels that the
prospects are “very good" that
SUNY Central will approve the
budget request. True will make it
emminently clear that we need
space.

Even if SUNY Central does give
“the go ahead.“ there will still re-
main at least one major obstacle
before construction can actually
begin. and that is approval by the
stat: \ltlitil‘c of the funds re-
qtrrr sittrl work. True is op-
timistic about the prospects iorap—
proial. “llrc legislature is not full
oi malicious people." he says. he
says. “ and ii they are convinced
that there is a genuine need.
the} \Hll approve rt," lie feels that
it will take littlcconvincingto show
that a serious need docs cxrst.

('ommcnts lruc: “'l'bis campus
has been well endowed over the
past ten years. and it is hard to con-
\incc the legislature when we‘ve
already had so much." He iccls that
our being well-endowed iii the past
has created an attitude that the U n-
i\crsity "doesn't need anything
else" which has consequently led to
the overcrowding problems not be-
ing iaccd.

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1973

One factor leading to the ‘
probable choice of the old field
house site as the project location is
that the architecture of the new
building may clash strongly with
the rest of the campus. Placing it
behind the campus lake would tend
to isolate it somewhat.

The possibility of building the
new structure across Fuller Road
from the uptown campus has not
been entirely ruled out. The Un-
iversity ownsseventy acres of land
there. and may have to sell it ifit is
not put to use soon. Building on the
site would serve to keep the land in
University hands. However. the
area is it long distance from then
cadcmic podium. and would create
many problems due to its in-
convenient location.

ll all goes according to schedule.
the architectural and engineering
work should begin this summer .
However. actual construction
would not begin ior several more
months as the final “logistics.” as
ll'tlL' calls them. are worked out.

ding.
