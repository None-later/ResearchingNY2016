Gerber Disclaims

ASP/UP Quote

On Friday. October l2. the ASP
reprinted an interview between
Steve Gerber. president of the Stu-
dent Association, and Unity Press.
an alternative Third World
newspaper on campus. The story
was reprinted in its entirety and
‘with the permission of the Unity
Press. In that story, quotations
were printed which later Gerber
vigorously denied ever saying. Ina
meeting between the ASP; Mr.
Gerber; Vernon Buck. who is a
Central Council member and also
the Director of the Educational
Opportunities Program: and Fred-
dic Stokeland. the president ofthe
EOP Student Association ' a group
funded through SA student tax.
Gerber took issue With the com-
ments he was purported to have
tnade concerning the method SA
used to appropriate funds to EOP—
SA.

The origitial budgetary request
made by EOI’SA was for $64,000.
Mike Lampert. then president of
SA. upon recommendation ol his
Executive Branch Iiudgct Com-
tiiittee. eiit that request to 535.000
which ('cntral (‘otincil lurther
reduced to 327.800 ill thc close of

school business in May. A few bills
came in to SA from EOP totaling
$2300 which Gerber is required to
pay first and ask questions on later.
The bills were paid out of the
Emergency Spending Line of SA
and have not as yet been acted on.
Central Council must now decide
whether to take the $2300 from
EOPSA‘s present appropriations,
since thebills were all incurred by
that group. or to let the University
absorb the loss and allow the group
to hold its present appropriations.
In any event. said Gerber. there
was no SA decision over tti
summer to cut EOPSA‘s budget as
had originally been reported.

“Frankly lhope thatCouncth‘en-
tral (‘ouncillsitsonthedamnthing
the whole year and doesn‘t LIL‘CItlL'
anything.“ Gerber said.

Finally. Gerber comrricntcd that
minority programming was the
single most activity that this lin-
itersity can provide and that Hil’r
SA. the group responsible lot It]
tercst programming. “is the single
tiiost important group that SA
funds oti this campus.“

acute. The money donated does
not go directly into the. purchase of
weapons. It is used to buy everyday
essential needs. to help settle im-
migrants (especially Russian Jews
who continue to arrive in large
numbers in spite of the war). and
other services. This frees other
tnonics for the purchase of
weapons.

Ilic other way to monetarily
lipr Israel is through the purchase
ol bonds. I'hese bonds are a direct
loan to the Israeli government. and
earn interest. A one-hundred
dollar bond matures iii fifteen
years and at the end til that titne is
worth 5 I80.

Blood donations are not nccdcd
as of now. but "we irate lists oi
hundreds of students \\Iio will
donate blood should the need
at'isc." says Shaw Ihc .ISt‘ is

arise. the Albany students Vtill be

Ilic third method of helping
Istaci is by going there to work oti a
kibhutl. III a tummy. or anywhere
clsc to lrcc someone else to light.

“There are twenty students ready‘

to leave immediately and thirty to.
forty others ready to leave at the‘

end of the semester," according to
the activities director. These
students will pay their own way to
Israel ($420) and will do volunteer
work there for six months. Those
students who are leaving im-
mediately are losing all credit for
this semester. as well as their tui-
tion. room. and board already paid
for this semester. Those students
who will be leaving at theend ofthe
sctiicstcr will probably be on some
sorty ofjoittt \vork-ulpan program.
where they will also Icam Hebrew.

"We are asking for sacrifice and
commitment from the students."
Ilic students signing over FSA
paychecks to the Israel Emergency
Fund and those who will be going
to Israel are used as examples of
this sacritice and commitment.
