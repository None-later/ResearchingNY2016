Bith C'ontml‘Here atLast

At long last SUNYA has a binh control clinic.
. The recent announcement of the institution of a contraception
clinic on campus is welcome news. For ywrs. interest groups like

PYE and Women‘s Liberation have pushed for such a service right
on campus. The Student Health Service offered little advice
and no direct services in this area and blocked all independent
attempts to set up an on-carnpus facility. Health Service argued
that the organization of such a senior: would take a tremendous
amount of time. effort and responsibility and questioned the need
for an exclusively campus clinic.

Student pressures prevailed upon the Health Service to set about

coordinating a binh control program Now. months later. with
the cooperation of the Albany Medical College. conception control
is a reality.
The atmosphere in which the clinic is conducted and the attitude
of stall and clientele is cructal to the clinic's success. Mutual trust.
cooperation. and understanding is of utmost importance at this
time. as the response of SL'NYA women will determine the luturc
direction of the program,

UN-eﬂectiveness

To the Editor.

The recent outbreak of violence
in the Middle East has shown the _
ineffectiveness of the United
Nations in its ability to control
member nations. and possibly a
beginning of its debacle as a world
peaCe-kceping force. The Security
Council convened and the General
Assembly met; but only to adjourn
in an atmosphere of cross-
aecusations and ﬂagrant outbursts
of tempers.

The United States and the Soviet
Union have also shown their
weaknesses as two of the crin-
trolling members of the nations til
the world. Out of |35 member
nations. only 25 are developed. but
I still fail to set: why thcrccannot be

able to exert a force sufﬁcient

Israel has Iongtricd to adhere to

To the ,Editor:

Linda Gaylord‘s article of 0c—
tober 9, I973, entitled “E.O.P.
Questions Answered", does more
than merely answer questions
poorly; it lies.

According to Ms. Gaylord. there
were seven hundred students on the
Educational Opportunity Program
in I968. There were I61 students
entering the program in the fall of
I968. I being one of them. Ob-
viously. Ms. Gaylord‘s research for
this article was pronouncedly in-
adequate as she neglected to con—
sult either the present director or
associate director. Ms. Gaylord
stated that of the "700 students" in
I968. “none of these have
graduated lrom S.U.N.Y.A.“ I
would like to inform Ms. Gaylord.
and the University at large. that
mttny of us have graduated. As a
matter of fact. seven of us"
graduated in less than 4 years.
Some of usgraduatcd with honors.

Many of us have continued our
education III the graduate level. I
personally .now of at least two
graduates at law school. three doc-
carrdidrttcs and several
master's candidates, without
pretending to have followed the
careers ol the entire class. I have

to stand on the bank and look at
the condition of the water. "Ugh! 
you might say. “Go down to the
waterfront? What a mess.“ Unfor-
tunately. this was the opinion of
many people in the l960‘s...the
Hudson River was already a dying
waterway and beyond hope in our
afﬂuent (or is it efﬂuent) society.

people living in the Hudson River
Valley who did not give up that
easily. These people realized what a
