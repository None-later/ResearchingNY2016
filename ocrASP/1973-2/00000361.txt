On Finding the

by Dennis Esposlt'

One rosin reason for lack of
government responsiveness to the
general public is simply because in
many respects the American
Government has become exten-
sively absorbed in sewing the many
private invested interests of this
country. Much to the extent that
corporate irresponsibility is
ﬂagrantly widespread. consumer
deception growing, and federal
agencies unquestionably
bureaucratic and inﬂexible. The
primary answer to correcting these
intolerable abuses is'by restoring
the average citizen back in his
government to challenge these for-
midable private forces. New
professional. and full-time citizen
groups must be established to on—
due the uneven balance
perpetuated to the people. especial-
ly since over 90% of this country‘s
legal representation is eagerly
working to protect only private
groups. associations. and in—
dividuals.

The proposal before students at
SUNYA is the creation of a New
York Public Interest Research
Group - an organization which will
in fact. give the Albany students
the actual power to do justice
against many social evils that beset
them and others. The process of a
NYPIRG is as follows:

Students begin by erecting a
student-funded organization of
students. faculty. and a
professional staff to work on
public interest problems. First. the
students begin by hiring a‘

professional staff of lawyers. scien- ’

lists. and engineers to create a
stable and lasting structure. lhis
professional staffis an absolute re-
quirement for the group‘s stability.
Since many student public interest
research projects can be in-
terrupted by numerous holidays
and summer recess periods. a full-
time working staff can still con-
tinue to work on projects for
Albany students. Moreover. any
desire to correct many of modern.
complex problems requires lasting
perscrvancc. continuous follow up
efforts and essential continuity. of
which otin a pcrmanent orttarii/a-
tion can rcndcr. In addition. the
stall Is "ceded to
inwslrgatc ill'l-‘HS whcre

ilcnt rights and problems lhctr

 
  

   

credentials. knowledge. and exper-
tise are instrumental to the student

cause.

The staff is hired. ﬁred and paid
for by students. It is the students
who must tax themselves a $2.00
per semester fee in order to finance
the staff. The fee is completely
voluntary and goes as a separate
line on the semester tuition bill
along with other optional fees such
as class dues. laundry. or health in-
surance. This separate NYPIRG
line can be put on the bill only after
the majority members of the un-
dergraduttte student body consents
by either petition or referendum to
establish the organivaiion and that
they want to .i'tlppurl the funding
of NYPIRG.

Once students collectively con-
sent to the voluntary fee. the Siti-
dcrit Association and or Ad-
ministration will be approached to
secure ccompletc university ap-
proval of NYI’I R(i. lricvitably. the
question of whcthcr NYPIRG is
educational or political or botfi will
likely arise before tthUNY Board
of Trustees. It is important to
cmphasr/e that for each step for
eventual NYPIRG success. a
strong and united student body Is
needed to help crcritca PIRG. The

road ahead is difficult. bttt over
400.000 students across the coun»
try have already completed it.

list is virtually limitless.

The professional staffhired (cen-
tral office and clerical) can cost
anywhere from $200,000 and
above. For this reason. schools in
the surrounding region must merge
their funds. But since Albany State
has a large constituency and prox-

are certainly assured of a healthy
part of that staff working for us.

Perhaps one can come to the best

understanding of the value of the
collegium by considering what
meaning it has for the student. the
younger scholar. One need not ap-
prove of the kind ofCollegium that
obtained at the early Universities.
especially Bologna. which was fora
time a “University of Students,“
where. and here I quote from
Nathan Schachner:
“The student body was con-
scious of its power. there were
clashes of temperament. and the
Doctors may have felt a certain
jealousy when they saw their
students organized and indepen-
dent. They pursued a selfish and
short-sighted policy. They sided
with the town in all conﬂicts; thcy
tricd to restrict the Doctorate to
fellow—citi/cns. The students began
to assume triore and more power
and authority over the academic
Studiutri. over lectures. over
courses of study. hours and
mcthods...even over the private
lives of their professors. until thc
grave and reverend Doctors...werc
reduced to a state of servitude. of
slaverytothcir pupils. unparalleled
in the history of education before
or since.“

We may add that the Doctors
might not absent themselves for
even a single day without permis—
sion frorii the students. and that if
hc “failed to secure an audience of
three or more depending on the
nature of the lecture. "he was fined
as though he had been absent; and
lie — not the pupils ~ had to be punc-
tual." If any prolessor“skippcd a
chapter...he was fined." Indeed the
students had the right of prrva/ro.
or discoinmuning the professor
found to be. or considered to be. iri—
compctcnt. it is possible that the
students foolishly granted the
faculty fifty-fifty voting rights in
academic matters and thereby lost
tiicit power.

But that anotnolous moment of
student pow'cr docs not. of course.

we might consider as the model for
a modern collegium. Power and
the formulation of policy accor-
ding to distinct and vital
philosophical principles to be
maintained by this body. One of
the central goals of this institution
is to elevate the student scholar to
the intellectual level of the teacher
through as nearly a mutual and
equal pursuit of knowledge as
possible. The student is to share in
the quest. be encouraged to excr-
cise his own imagination. stimulate
his own curiosity. The danger of
examinations as inhibitors of fear-
ning must be avoided. therefore. In
this connection. the cxpcricncc of
the early Einstein may prove in
structivc: 0f the l’olytcchnic Ill
