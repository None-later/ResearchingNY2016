by Jack Uppal
and Brian lGreen

It is often true that when a
player has a cramped posi-
tion he is more liable to make
errors. The reason for this is
largely psychological
(claustraphobia?) In any
event. a spatial advantage is
actually intensified by the
addition of the psychological
factor. Two games will il-
lustrate this point.

Tricks and Trumps

by Henry Jacobson

When used according to
directions. the right dosage
of bridge conventions can
strengthen any partnership
and eliminate Ulcers by
facilitating the bidding on
certain difficult hands. But
when used to excess. they
can lead even a good
partnership to tie bridge
hospital (usually for the
removal of a nutlignant
partner). An overdose may
kill the partnership by over-
laxing the player's'
memories when the use of
certain valuable items might
be clouded by this constant
drudgery of remembering
and being able to utilize a
plethora of conventions.

So if your partner 15 nor

Message To Grassroots

yall say u wanna git
your heads together

but dope ain't shit

cuz it don't care whether

The UNITY PRESS
newspaper is by definition
“very much together." from
beginning to and black
students are given an oppor-
tunity to become more aware
of the forces which shape our
environment. BLACK
ROOTS has stated before
however. we must move from
the “level of reality as
awareness to the level of
reality as change.“ this
should not alienate u. we are
always going thm changes.
but change for the sake of
change ain't sayin nuthin!
let‘s have some for real
changes. (if u don't think
they are necessary check out

u wanna be free
forever and a day
or jus long enuf
to cop u a tray

it'll make u feel
like u on cloud 9

‘ but then it'll steal
your fertile black mind

and give it to the man
who smiles when he sees
u and sweet stuff sam
down on your knees

our environment ) before
changes can come about
however. we have to share
our knowledge. BLACK
ROOTS appearing in the asp
every friday and
MICROCOSM IN BLACK
appearing in the asp every
tuesday will reflect the ideas
of black people. if we have

crying the blues

bout bein free

and paying your dues
for trying to be

none neither B LACK ROOTS

nor MICROCOSM IN
BLACK will appear. just as
UNITY PRESS will not
appear if our bruthas and
sistuhs are "too lame " to
know what‘sgoin on and “too
shame" to tell it like it is.
the followmg poem
reflects my feelings about
getting high. ichose todo the
article “Superfly” vs N.Y.S.
Drug Law for UNITYPRESS
because i hate to see my peo-
ple destroying themselves.

so next time u squirt
that shit in your arm
stop! think of the hurt
and all of the harm

u are doing “we people
who are darker than blue"
cuz u's more than a junky
u‘s a flunky toolllll!
