Too Much to Handle

by Patricia Maud

was hilarious. I went to the show
virtually unfamiliar with the com-
edy of the duo. Performing with
the comedians was a band of
Columbians by the name of
Fingers.

Fingers. headed by musician
Eyeartoe. constituted a major por-
tion of the show. Their instrumen-
tals consisted of the typical elec—
trics. with the slightly imentive
usage of a table ol unnamed
sounds. Altltottglr giirrrruckry

Mikis 'I'heodorakis: No other
20th century musical figure enjoys
such world-wide prestige and pop-
ularity as this giant of a man. who
is Greece's most prolific composer
and one of the most colorful and
controversial political figures of his
time. A giant both in physical
stature and in talent. 'l‘heodorakis
has composed a prodigious otttput
of music which has won awards
and captured the hearts ol'literally
hundreds of millions of people
throughout the world. His name
today is synonymous with some of
the most intoxicating musicextant.
but also with the unrelenting battle
of resistance to tyranny and op-
pression being waged by the (i reek
people against the military regime
currently in power. And. as he has
becorrre the spokesman for millions
of his (ircck countrymen. he has

word "concern" cannot convey the
nuance of the (ireek word that
'l'heodorakis used What he meant

A Profile of ‘ The Candidates... m...-

Vincent Bytner

by Judy Skolnlelt

Bright. Young, Timely. New,
Energetic. Right . are the words
plastered on a billboard on top nfa
travel agency on Central Avenue.
This is the headquarters of Vince
Bytner. the independent
democratic candidate for mayor of
Albany. ‘ Bytncr. the owner of
the travel agency believes he will be
able to topple Mayor Corning.
who is finishing his thirty second
year in ofﬁce. His youth is his
primary selling point along with
the point that he is the “indepen-
dent" candidate. His premise is
that the people of Albany will win
over the machine.

Why is a successful businessman

running for election., Hy tncr

claims that Albany is part of him.
He was born and raised here. He
went 'to school here and was a
social case worker aftergraduating
from Saint Rose. He now resides
here with his wife and children and
can no longer stand to see the pro-
ple of Albany silent. Bytner likens
himself to Christoplrcholumbus.
his mascot. for he professesto have

“the same perserverence to bring

new ideals to Albany that Colum-
bus had to bring new ideals to the
world.

Bytner believes that Corning
should not be allowed to serve
another term because in public ser-
vice as well as private industry the
maximum age for rClircment
should be any Inc. "Age." he
states “has defirrrte bearing on a
person's capacrty to prclorm the

 

almost overwhelming duties as
mayor under present and future
problems that have to be tackled.
It is quite natural that duties by
delegated to younger men in our
society“. He feels his forty five
years give him the experience and
the youth to serve well.

Bytner claims that he had been
offered the Republican nomina-
tion but had denied it. He calls
Touhey (theRepublican candidate)
aJohnny Come Latelyand accuses
thathecould not betruely indepen-
dent because of the support he is
receiving from the Republican par-
ty. Bytner claims that he alone is a
“non political politician" using
“fresh new approach". His cam—
paign manager-brother-in-Iaw.
lorry Roman has neyer been in—
vol\cd in politics before. and so he

says he is truer independent.

Bytner has just won a court bat-
tle over the legitamacy of his can-
didaey. He states that he was
counselled bya legal representative
on how his independent
nominating ipetition should be
filled out. These petitions were re-
jected by the same man who had
counselled him. and he was taken
offthe ticket. After taking the case
to court the incident has been
cleared and he is again running.

Bytncr is a businessman'and
believes that only a businessman
can manage the ﬁnancial problems
of a city. He is the holder of the
outstanding Businessman Award
of I972 and the immediate past
president of the Central Civic
MerchantsAssociation. Hethinks

he can be the “super salesman” that
Albany needs to go out and bring
big business to Albany. He
proposes a Ten year Tax Incentive
Alotrnent plan to help encourage
big conpanies to come to Albany
and thus carry some of the ﬁnan-
cial load.

With the extra monies from in-
dustry. he sroposes to build
sports and recreation centers in
Albany. He would also like to see
new cultural and social
developments made such as the in-
stition of heuuty contests to bring
community spirit to Albany. He
believes the capital of the state
should not trail behind in these ac-
tivities.

Bytner expresses interest in the
State University and is striving for
Better Communication between
the University and the city of
Albany. He claims he is interested
in the students because they spent
I our years of their money and time
In Albany and deserved to be con-
sidered in its politics despite the
fact that many do not vote here.
He hasdcmonstrated hrsinterest tn
the past by coming on campusand
d iscouragingthe use of inexpensive
carters because of the dangers they
possess;

Mr, Bytner encourages the
cooperation of the young. To help
bnng the people ol Albany into
their politics. he proposes monthly
toun hall meeting with the City
Department officials and the
crtr/ens so that better communica-
rron cart develop. In this way his
administration would not become
a new machine Bytncr strrrrs up his
campaign by saying that Ire is run—

and that no one is pushing him.
