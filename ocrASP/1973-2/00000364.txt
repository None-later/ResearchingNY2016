Erastus Corning II

by Riel Soda.

Erastus Corning the 2d become
the70thmayor of Albany inl94lat
age 32 - the youngest man to be
elected chief executive of this city.
He has remained in this office for
32 years. the longest of any mayor
in the tri-city area. Today at 64.
Corning, who claims that politics
has become “more challenging
than ever before" is running for a
9th term as mayor on Democratic
and Conservative lines.

In many ways, Corning is iri-
deed facingchallengesgreater than
those he has previously en-
countered. The recent iState Inver—
tigation Committee hearings into
wide—spread corruption in the
Albany Police Dept.. called for by
the mayor himself in response to ‘a
series of articles by Scott Christian-
son on the A. P.D. have put Cor—
ning into a defensive stance. The
hearings have unearthed a dismal
history of A.P.D. racketeering.
prostitution and organized crime.
which, according S.I.C chairman

Edward'Silver. reﬂects a “lack of
alert leadership on the part of top
city ofﬁcials". The Mayor, obliged
to defend his city’s Police Depart-
ment. rebuffed Silver‘s charges,
claiming that “nothing of any
evidence has come out of theS.l.C.
hearings. lt'sinnuendos,heresay."
Corning further asserts that the
A.PD. is the “finest in the state."
In anger over the hearing's
procedures. the Mayor has drafted
a six pointed assault on investiga-
tion tactics. The plan calls for:

I) Cross examination of
witnesses by defense attorneys

2) Strict limitation on the power
of the commission to grant im-
munity to witnesses for purposesof
obtaining testimony

3) Mandatory exclosurc of ex-
onerating evidence obtained in
probe

4) Right ofwitnesses to knowac—
cuscrs

5) T.V. coverage of hearings

6) Guidelines restricting manner
that witnesses may beinterrogated

Another obstacle, in Corning’s
path is the hard. extensive cani-
paign waged by Carl Touhey.
Republican candidate for Mayor.

that he has never failed to keep - /

quested that the Mayor make

said that he would only do so in bits
and pieces. Theresa Cook.

management against the ad—

Despite the attack against nim.

In each of his campaigns [or
