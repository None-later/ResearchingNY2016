The big meet ended just like it
did last year. as the Albany barriers
were soundly beaten by a strong
Colgate team last Saturday. The
score for the meet was Colgate 20

Grid

by The Blond Bombshell

After a horrible week of 6-7 and
the breaking of two crystal balls.
we will try again. Season record is
41-25.

PITTSBURGH over JETS by
ID. The Steelers are angry after los-
ing and the Jets have no air attack.
Pittsburgh should stop the run.

DALLAS over GIANTS by 7.
Giants are due to wake up but
Dallas has lost two in a row and
three is impossible.

ATLANTA over SAN DIEGO
by 3.The Chargersunder Foutsare
improved but Bob Lee got it all
together last week. He should do it
again.

DETROIT over BALTIMORE
by 3. Detroit lost to New Orleans
last week. They will be up for this
one.

MIAMI over BUFFALO by 6.
The leaders in the East fight it out
and the team with the better
defense should win. Therefore it
will be Miami.

CLEVELAND over
HOUSTON by 7. Cleveland just
missed against Miami. They
should have no trouble versus
Houston.

Leading the Albany charge was
Jim Shrader. who ﬁnished third.
some 35 seconds behind the leader.
It was a tired Shrader, who was
forced to go out fast to try to stay
with Colgate‘s top runner. He was
unable to do it and tired in the last
mile to lose second place.

Picks

GREEN BAY over L.A. by l.
The Packer offense is not too effec-
tive but it isa must game for them.
L.A. has been sensational but this
week the streak ends.

CHICAGO over NEW
ENGLAND by |. Chicago has not
won in a whilc.lt's about time to
change this.

SAN I‘RANCISCO ovcr NEW
ORLEANS by 9. New Orleans
cannot win three in a row. (This is
the same person who said they
couldn't win two in a row.)

MINNESOTA over
PHILADELPHIA hy4. ll'scloser
than anybody expects. but
Minnesota should stay undefeated.
though the Eagles are improving.

WASHINGTON over St.
LOUIS by 7. St. Louis won last
time. Washington never loses twice
to the same team so it will probably
lose this time but on performanch
must go with Allen.

OAKLAND ovcr DENVER by
9. Oakland‘s offense is coming and
their defense is tough. Denver will
be psyched but experience rules.

“Our fathers bod reached the frontiers which were
recognized in the partition plan. Our generation

Vinnie Reda. regaining much of
his lost form, finished sixth with
CarloCherubino ﬁnishing seventh.
Curt Woodcock. tenth and Chris
Burns. thirteenth rounded up the
first ﬁve. Dissappointing perfor-
mances were handed in by Herb
Hassan.Bill Sorel and John Koch.
Albany was again hindered by in-
juries with Nick De Marco not run-
ning.

The Colgate team was extremely
deep with their number one runner
running free and easy the whole
way. He ran the lirstthreemilcs in
l5:l0. an Albany record. This was
the same Colgate learn that heat
Cornell earlier this year.

With the last higdticl inch over.
Albany prepped forthis Saturday's

SUNY’s by taking on Hartwick
Tuesday. In the worst weather to
date Albany easily won 16—47.

Sitting this one out was the in-
jured DeMarco. BillSorel and Vin-
nie Reda. The outcome was never
in doubt with first Curt Woodcock
and then Carlo Cherubino setting
the pace. -

Cherubino took over near the
mile mark and never looked back.
running a time of 262l8 over the
five milc course and easily winning
Hero Hassan made up for the
Colgate meet by catching a tiring
.l iin Shrader for second. lliscffort
won him the "Runner of the Meet"
award. ('hris Burns liritshed fourth
with .lohn Koch sixth.

 

Soccer Edged 

Amalingly. the Danes did not
give tip. Several rushes were made
on the ()neonta net. all being
stopped. and then came the key
play. with a mere twelve seconds
left. A long pass by Aldrich lound

one break. Shot. stivc. rebound,

save and fell into the not A badly
beaten relcrec who was at least 40
yards away from the play could not
make the call. and al’tera bricl con-
lcrence with his cohort. the ball
was given to Albany on an rilcdged

that the refs knew that lllc)’\\crc

its SUNY crown. On paper they
have the best team even with Nick
DeMarco sitting itout. But, Vinnie
Reda and Jim Shrader have not
quite found last Year‘s form and
most ofthe team has been relative-
ly inconsistent. Hopefully they will
peak together for this meet and
perform as they did last year.

In .l.V. action the Pups were
beaten by Colgate 22-34 but Rich
Langford ran the fastest Albany
time ofthc day in winning in 2(y1l2.

In one of the tightest races
league I has seen in several years.
both playoff spots have yet to be
decided. GDX was knocked out of
first place on Tuesday, as the psy-
ched up Wildmen took them 7-0,
while the third contender. STB.
remained idle. EEP and KB are still
vaguely in contention, but in rcali-
ty. are pretty much out ofthc pic-
ture.

In weekend action. STB smash-
ed KB 20-0. thus maintaining their
strong playoff bid. Big games are
on tap for all of these teams. es-
pecially on this coming Sunday.

More on that Wildmen GDX

Wildmen scored on a broken play
which saw QB trike il in. GDX
played a very poorgarnc. and it was

ed a mere seven points. However
Sunday's rematch should see GDX:
(who was missing several starters)
back at full strength. and could be
quite a rnatclitip.

possibly the best in all of the

AMIA Football League [II

In League IIIA. Paine Hall has
been the team to beat all season. as
their ll-(H record indicates.
Strangely enough. their only tie
came against the cellar dwelling
Iladgcrs by a 7-7 score. In the ma~
Jor weekend action. the Pcrvcrts

and Dust tangled. and the result
was 26-6 in favor of Dust. thus
knotting them for second place
honors. Both teams close out their
seasons against relatively weak op-
poncnts. so it will take an upset to
break a straight tie.

In League IIIB. the Colonists

have wrapped up the title with an 8-
0 mark. However. the action con-
tinues with a battle for the second
spot. STBIII. Jungle Rot. and the
LA. Ramses are all looking for the
playoff bids. and STB battles LA.
on the last day of the season. and
the winner may take the bid.
