Forget all that has occured
previous to today 85‘ far as
Albany State football is con-
cerned, for the real 1973 season
begins tomorrow afternoon at
University Field. The oppo-
nent is Curry College, a varsity
squad from the outskirts of
Boston, and the important dis-
tinction with regards to this
particular team, as well as all,
the other teams on the schedule

Action in Saturday's crushing v

from now on is that they are in-
deed varsity, and not the sub-
standard material which the
Great Danes have destroyed in
three earlier football contests
this year. '

The latest slaughter oceured
last week against what is
labeled our “cross-town rival,"
Siena College. However, after
the Danes humiliated them on
their home field by the score of
7l-8. it becomes difficult to

.r.

consider Siena much of a rival
when discussing football. The
Danes accumulated huge sums
of yardage in the first half,
utilizing the wishbone to its full
effectiveness. Coach Bob Ford
stated: “We played the best first
half of footballl i think we‘ve
ever played here. John Bertuzzi
read well, ran the triple option
well, and threw well. Because of
his play basically we were able
to mount quite an offensive

u

ictory over Siena.

showing in the first half." Ber-
tuzzi and the offense was aided
by what Ford termed a “...poor
defensive game plan against
us,“ as the Siena defense allow-
ed Griffin. Perry, and Hollie to
get outside continuously

Now that the Danes have rid
themselves of opposition which
was obviously not in the same
class (with the exception of
course of Nichols, a varsity
team which defeated Albany
i4-7), ' Albany will find out
how good a team they trulyare.
They will be facing a defensive
unit which has been outstan-
ding for the past couple of
seasons, headed by all-league
linebacker John Gardner.
number 56. He and defensive
tackle Ed Rabino, who both
stand (1‘1" and weigh 220,
should provide some problems.
as they possess speed and abili-
ty which the offensive squad
has not faced thus far. Gardner
is particularly quick and agile.
rind can be expected to bcmak-
ing most of the tackles. The
general feclingis that ifCurry is

rely on their defense to contain
the Albany rushing attack.
whichhas been nothingshortof

offensively. Curry displays
some weaknesses, especially in
the area of outside running,
which they simply do not
possess. They also have been
lacking in their pass protection,

which makes for a very
dangerous combination. A
team can generally get by
without a big outside threat, as
long as their passing attack can
pick up theslack - witnessthe
New York Jets of past years.
But when there is also a
breakdown ’in pass protection,
it usually makes for a virtually
insurmountable deficiency-
witness the Jets of this season.
if Curry cannot pick up good
yardage on the ground. they
will be forced to go to the air.
and the Danes can subsequent-
ly rush quarterback Scott
Ahern into mistakes. if Ahcrn
can get the ball away. he‘ll be
throwing to either Jim
Williams, a very fast flanker-
back, or split end Rich Voll.

l‘hc Danes plan nothing
drastic in the way of game
plans. as they will be content to
move on the ground and stifle
('urry on defense. Coach Ford
looks for a game similar in
many respects to the Nichols
game. in which the Danes
fumbled seven times and lost
14-7. if they can hold onto the
ball.they should win. However.
if they are subvpar in any aspect
of play, it could he quite a

by Dick Barnes
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON AP -
Demands for impeachment of
President Nixon or his resigna-
tion mounted Monday as of-
ficial Washington prepared for
a barrage of formal actions in
the Watergate tapes confronta-
tion.

Sen. Daniel K. inouyc, D-
Hawaii. a member of the
Senate Watergate committee.
called for Nixon's resignation.
Americans “have suffered
enough" and “must be spared
this new pain and trauma.“ in-

While White House aides
sought to moilify critical
senators and congressmen with
explanations of Nixon‘s action,
criticism of the move continued
to pile up -asignificant amount
of it from Republicans.

At the White House, Nixon
considered whether to take his
case directly to the public,
whose confidence in the Presi—
dent was at a new low even
before Saturday‘s events, ac-
cording to a new Gallup Poll.

Rep. Morris K. Udall, D--
Ari/ona. proposed Monday
that .\‘ixon agree to resign in
return for the immediate con-
firmation of liotisc Minority
Leader Gerald R. Ford of
Michigan as \ ice president. and
