Boost in SUNY Tuition

WASHINGTON, D. C. (SASU)
- The recent recommendation
made by the Committee for
Economic Development (CED) to
double college tuition has drawn
sharp criticism from Student
National Education Association
President Thomas A. Santestcban.

Speaking for 80,000 students on
over I.I00 college and university
campuses across the nation.
Santesteban said. “Ifthis report is
accepted. it could become another
example of the Nixon Ad-
ministration‘s providing treatment
without diagnosing the illness.“

“This plan would double or tri-
ple tuitions, force students out of
their planned courses of study with
no consideration of such things as
loans already taken out for their
future. What are the possibilitiesof
today‘s students being able to
finish their education?"

“Where were the siudents on the
Commission?" asked Santesteban.
“It is extremely difficult for me to
understand how a committee can
presume to make recommen-
dations affecting the lives and
pocketbooks of millions of
students. and never seek their
opinions. The ineptness of this
committee is evidenced by its
shortsightedncss in its failure to
recogni/c today's educational
needs.

“How can students not be con-
sidered a vital part of such a corn—
mission?" asked Santcstcban. a
senior iit Northern Arilona Un-
iversity. I’Iagstaff. “They are the
real consumers of our national
product labeled ‘education.’ How
can a trade commission presume to
know the needs of students or of

education?

“This commission spent $400.—
000 on the study." he continued. “I
shudder to think how many
students could have been educated
for this amount of money. To real-
ly get at the problem, the money
should have gone into legislative
efforts to restructure the
educational financing system."

“It would be easy to compare
this to the recent Russian Wheat
Deal.“ the 23-year-old student
leader commented. “I seriously
question whether the commission
has considered the far-reaching
ramifications of its recommenda-

tion. Again. it appears tltat the
American public will be asked to
pay for an inequitable decision
made by a few.“

“Where are our vcslcd rights as
students?“ Santestcban asked. “If
we really are concerned on a
national level about the education
of students today. let's put the en-
tire program into perspective. This
report should be rejected. Any
future attempts to analyze and
develop the financial structuring of
education must include the real
consumer of education - the stir-
dent.“

The “Students for the Improve—

irt their interest of making both the
university and community rrtore

much for wheelchair students. the
visually handicapped. and those
with any disability as it is for those
students with no disability at all.

The first of such tasks isaimed at
modifying such architectural
problems now existing to include
the stairways. steps at doorways.
and far-away parking areas that

dormitory residence areas.

The library. as much an area of
academic impediment to the
visually handicapped as wheelchair
students. is but one aspect of the
University which needs modifica-

academic programs. At recent con-
