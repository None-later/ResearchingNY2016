Vernon Buck, director of "the
.Educational Opportunities
Program. took the opportunity at a
meeting between the ASP and Stu-
dent Association President Steve
Gerber to outline some of the
highlights of the BOP program.
facts that had been missed in a
previous ASP story.

According to Mr. Buck, there
were 168 students admitted in the
ﬁrst year of the program's opera-
tion back in I968. Since that class
(Class of I972) approximately l00
students have graduated SUNYA
from this program. There are 45
grads of SUNYA EOPwhoare con-
tinuing as grad students here as
well as three students who are
currently going for‘a doctorate.

Several of the BOP students
found careers in the Internal
Revenue Service. Two studentsare
currently employed by IBM.one of
them as the chief computer
operator. Many of the students
have gone into teaching careers.’

The EOP program is funded
from the New York State
Legislature and is directly respon-
sible_ to Vice President for
Academic Affairs Philip Sirotkin.
The EOP program SUNY-wide is
under the ministers of the Office of
Special Programs in SUNY Cen-
tral.

The funds come from SEEK
monies and are allocated for
counselingtutoring and other Ad-

ministrative activities. All other
costs are borne by the campus.
EOP provides this campus with
800 full time equivalent students.
the basis for teacher‘s salaries and
funds given to SUNYA by the

‘ State.

Buck explained the difference
between the EOP program and the
EOP student association as
perfectly analogous to the
differences between. SA and the
Administration of SUNYA. EOP-
SA is simply another special in-
terest group funded by SA
speciﬁcally for the purpose of
providing minority interest
programming.

The minority students. says
Freddie Stokeland. President of
EOPSA. are not sufficiently
represented by the various ac-
tivities commities in SA and don‘t
feel a real identification with the
school. “I don‘t have any great love
for this campus.“ commented
Stokeland. “It's not the feelingjust
of me or black students or minority
students. but students in general."

EOPSA. in its function of ac—
tivities coordinator for minority-
interest programming. has spon-
sored assorted academic and
cultural organimtions in addition
to the concerts and social func-
tions. Stokcland reports that those
on EOPSA strongly resent the
“partying” connotation frequently
affixed to the group by students.

As part of its ongoing examina-
tion and evaluation of New York‘s
State University system. SUNY‘s
Central Administration held a
joint seminar conference with the
Middle States Association (MSA)
of Collegesand Secondary Schools
on October l.2 and 3. MSA is a
well known northeastern ac-
creditation society.

The seminar. entitled “Campus-
Central Staff Relationships“, was
the ﬁrst phase of a two pan study
of the multi-campus state universi—
ty system undertaken by SUNY
and MSA.

Participants in the seminar in-
cluded two SUNY students. Steve
Gerber and Philip Deitch.
Presidents of the Student
AssociationsatSUNY-Albanyand
Nassau Community College
respectively; SUNY Chancellor
Ernest L. Boyer; several of hisstaff
members; and various college
presidents. Gerber is a member of
the SASU Executive Committee.

According to the Chancellor, the
goal of the ongoing seminar was
twofold: First. “to determine what
is working well (in the SUNY
system) and where improvements
can and should be made. and se-
cond. to provide administratorsof
other systems “an opportunity to
study and react to the operation
and organi/ational structure of
State University."

Though the seminar was
prittiarily concerned with ttikingtin
objective look zit the operations of
SUNY ('cntrtil and its
relationships to the components of
SllNYindividuaI campuses. thc
stiitc govcrnnicnt aitd the tax-
payers ol New Yorkissncsdircctly
affecting students through the new
SASlJ/Studcitt Assembly struc-
ture were discussed,

In an intervth after the session.
Albiiny SA President (icrhcr said
that of thc ctght working papers

prepared by the SUNY Central
staff as the bases for discussions.
three have special importance to
students' relationship with—and
effect upon-SUNY Central. The
three are entitled: “The Leadership
Function - An Overall View."
“Faculty Relationships." and "Ae-
countability Within the System.”

The paper on leadership. written
by C' " Boyer. " ‘the
role of central administration as
leader of SUNY. but stressed the
Chancellor's conviction that "a
central staff exists to service the
colleges within the system.“

According to Boyer. the central
staff serves five primary functions.
First. there is the “direction of Un-
iversity wide operations - the day to
day implementation of existing
policy." Second. there is the plan-
ning and development of new
policy. according to educational
trends and the needs of individual
campuses. Third. there is the func-
tion of educational change. “the
need to discover new educational
and administrative arrangements
that move ahead sharply from file
status quo.”Boycr said. The need
to analyze the effectiveness of the
University in meeting its objectives
is SUNY Central‘s fourth func-
tion.Finally there is thcjob ofcom—
munication and interpretation of
the University as a “collective
enterprise“ and response to
criticism.

Ari important part of the
operations of Central Administra-
tion involve university-wide (IUCI-
sion making ()ii this topic. the
piipcr states: "thc Chancellor and

Gerber sees the fur.iction of the
Student Assembly. and especially
its executivccommittee.as beingot
critical importance in getting
SUNY to respond to student needs
and desires. “Central Administra-
tion is such a powerfuland skillful
group of people."Gerber said.“ih:it
students must clearly understand
and be able- to express their
_,  on various issues.“ What
is needed. according to Gerber. is a
“mo-professionalism" on the part
of the students when dealing wilh
central staff.

Students seek   -

by Sue Leboff

When the N ixon Administration
cuts funds for Federal programs
the average person doesn't feel the
results directly. Butthe people who
use the Carver Community Health
Center in Schenectady are going to
feel the results very soon. Deprived
of Federal funding. the Center will
probably have to close down on
December 3|.

The Health Center is part of
Carver Community Center. which
is a l5—minute drive north of this
campus. in a neighborhood of
private homes which look past
their peak. The Center itself is
spanking new. an attractive. low
building of brick and glass. It
houses recreation facilities. a walk-
in mental health clinic. and. for as
long as it lasts. the Ifealtht‘cntcr.

Anyone who comes to get a

broken leg treated has to get helped
up the lour or five steps leading to
the Center. Once past the stairs.
patients find medical help for
broken limbs and everything else
besides: ftiII dental care. a “Well-
llaby Clinic“ for prc- and post-
natal crirc. and fl family planning
service provided by Planned
Parenthood. Also part of the
('cntcr arc out-reach workers. who
visit geriatric and homchound
DilIlL‘llIN tit thctr homes.

Were Carver to fold. the Well
Baby Clinic would continue to
operate out of Ellis Hospital, but
the dental program. the medical
program. and the out—reach
program would cease to exist. Per-
sonnel at Carver include 2 doctors.
2 dentists. 3 psychiatrists. out-
reach workers. and a clerical staff.
Mr. Jim Bishop is Director of the
Center. The SUNYA Faculty of
Nursing sends students who are go-
ing into community nursing to
Carver to train.

Carver handles 28.6% of
Schenectady's welfare clients. but
the majority of patients are
“marginal cases“ - people who are a
little too well off to get welfare.but
still not well off enough to afford
private health‘ca re. There are 2.248
patients at the dental clinic. 3.333
in the adult medical program. and
645 in pediatrics. Carver handles
everything from routine vac-
cinations to ambulance emergen—
cics.

Lee Ann Roberts. a transfer stu-
dent who plans on making social
Work her career. has been in-
strumental in bringing Carver's
plight to the attention of the
SllNYA community. Ms. Roberts
discovered Carver as part of a per-
sonal investigation of social service
facilities iit this area l u! up that
thc (‘cnlcr was worth \.I\ tut-,1. ot zit

least keeping open as long as possi-
ble. Ms. Rubens embarked on a
publicity and fund raising cam-
paign. enlisting the help of the rest
of her Community Development
Class.

She‘s tried to touch all the bases.
from sorority presidents to the
President of the United States.She
obtained astatement of support for
Carver from Central CounciL
which was sent to Health. Educa-
tion and Welfare. Nixon. and the
Washington and Albany regional
medical associations. Her com-
mittee is presently soliciting funds
from student and faculty
organirations. She's asked for
$50.00 from each fraternity and
sorority. Sl00.00 from each
class.Behind a desk in the lobby of
the Campus Center. the Carver
supporters have joined the par-
tisans of embattled Israelis and un-
ioniIed farm workers in asking for
students' contributions. Ms.
Roberts‘ goal is Sl.000.00. enough
to fund one out—reach worker on a
part-time basis until December.

One reason (‘arvcr is so valuable
to the [)Lt)pIC it scrvcs.accordingto
Ms. Roberts. is that 99A of the
doctors in Schenectady arc vcry
very cool to Medicare.“ This ttl-
titudc towards Medicare patients
has bccn verified by It survey cott—
tItit'fI'd In Mr Iiishop. IIlt' /\II1dlI\

Regional Medical Association. By
contrast. at Carver. one finds “real-
ly good rapport between the
medical profession and the
'marginal‘ people.“

The Center opened a year and a
half ago. Some funding for out-
reach workers came from Sharing
with Friends of the Quakers. but
the basic support was “00,000.00
from the Department of Health.
Education. and Welfare' for the
fiscal year ending December 3i.
I973. As Carver has an estimated
operating cost of around $6500.00
at month. this was ample funding.
but unfortunately for the Center.
the HEW money was reduced by
Nixonian impoundment first to
$8400.00. then $5600.00. and. al-
timately $2000.00. As a result.
Carver is running on people
donating their services. borrowed
money. borrowed time. The
Schenectady City Council recently
gave (‘arver $l000.00. enough to
keep the Health Ccntcrgoing until
December 3|. But even 50. services
are being cut back.

Also housed in the Carver Com-
munity ('cntcr isa separate walk-in
mental health clinic. Many of the
tower patients get help with per-
sonal problems there. This clinic is
funded by Ellis Hospital. and.
compared to the Health (‘cntctz is
III sound financial shape. Iltc

Carver Health Center has tried to
get funded the same way. either by
St. Clare‘s Hospital or Ellis. Thus
far St. Clare‘s has been totally un-
able to help Carver; Ellis is still
.considering the matter.

' The best thing for Carver would
be to get its HEW money back.
Withihai end in mind. Caerr
plans to join in a lawsuit initiated
by the Buffalo Regional Medical
Association against HEW. This
will be the ﬁrst lawsuit challenging
Nixon‘s freezes on congressional
allocations of taxpayers' money.
Since. after the initial cutback.
Carver was firmly promised
$8400.00. and Carver only ended
up with $2000.00. whether the law-
suit will be decided in Carver's
favor or not is what is known as a
$6400.00 question.

Mrs. Clara Stamper. R. N.. is the
smiling nurse in charge of the
clinic. whose manner is as brisk
and efﬁcient as any nurse of
folklore and fiction. She says she
likes working at Carver and knows
a lot of the people personally.
Compared to Ellis Hospital. where
shc worked for four years. she says
“I fch tltc people talk to us more
here than in the hospital." Asked
what she'll do if Carver closes. shc
replies. “I believe in positivc
thought. and so I haven‘t really
thought about what I‘ll do if
(‘arvcr closes." ii
