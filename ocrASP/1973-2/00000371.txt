A!

Egypt and Israel ordered their
troops to silence their guns Mon-
day after I7 days of bloody tank,
infantry and aerial combat.

But a U.N.-Seeurity Council
cease-lire deadline passed with no
indication Syria was ready to halt
its part in the two-front Middle
East war.

“There is no cease-ﬁre on the
Syrian front,” declared a high-
ranking Israeli ofﬁcer in Tel-Aviv.

Damascus said itwwas studying
the UN. appeal and Iraq. the ma-
jor Arab nation ﬁghting with the
Syrians, rejected it.

An honr after the cease-ﬁre
deadline the Israeli command said
f iring was continuing in some areas
of the Egyptian front, but had
stopped in others. “There is no
clear picture." acommunique said.

Cairo and Tel Aviv announced
they had handed down orders to
their troops to hold their fire unless
ﬁred upon along the Suez Canal
front that has been bitterly con—
tested since war erupted Oct. 6.

The Israeli state radio reported
Egyptian artillery was still shelling
Israel’s beachhead on the western
side of the Suez Canal several
minutes after the cease-ﬁre off icial-

ly went into effect at 6:50 pm. local
time.

But their radio's correspondents
said later the central sector of the
battleﬁeld was quiet and Egypt's
Middle East New Agency
reported that authorities reopened
Cairo airport for the ﬁrst time since
the war began.

The truce was jointly proposed
by the Soviet Union and the United
States, the superpowers backing
the warring parties. It was voted in
the Security Council early Monday
after an agreement worked out in
Moscow over the weekend by
Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger and Soviet Communist
party leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.

In addition to the cease-ﬁre in
place, it called for Israeli
withdrawal from Jordanian, Egyp-
tian and Syrian land captured in
the sire-day ‘h‘MXT of I967 and
negotiations aimed at a lasting
peace agreement for the Middle
East, site of four wars since the
Jewish state was declared in I948.

The Syrian delay in accepting
the cease-fire. if itcontinues. could
undermine efforts to carry out the
post cease-fire portions of the
agreement.

Kissinger stopped in Israel brief-
ly Monday on his way home from
Moscow to confer with Premier
Golda Meir and other Israeli
leaders, presumably to ﬁll them in
on the subsequent steps intended in
his accord with Brezhnev.

The cease-ﬁre came with the
Israelis claiminga net gain of about
His square miles of Arab land
over the truce lines settled on at the
close of the I967 Middle East war.

This additional occupation con-
stituted a strong trump for peace
negotiations called for in the
Security Council resolution.

Israeli officials said their forces
hold 745 square miles of territory
in a beachhead reaching about 19
miles into Egypt proper. west ofthe
Suez Canal. which has been the
cease-ﬁre line since Israel seized the
Sinai peninsula from Egypt in tlic
I967 war.

But Egypt claimed retaking con-
trol over a narrow battleground
along the entire eastern bank ofthe
I03-mile-Iong waterway, except at
the Israeli cross-canal spearhead
just north of Great Bitter Lake
about midway up the canal.

Some of the Egyptian positions

into the Sinai Desert, Cairo claim-
ed. But Israel said the Egyptian-
held strip was only two to four
miles deep and contained about
3l0 square miles.

Whatever its depth, the Egyptian
recapture of some of its lost Sinai
'and after six years was a morale-
builder in Egypt and the rest of the
Arab world, sorely conscious of the
celebrated six-day Israeli victory of
I967.

The Egyptian foothold on the
Israeli-held side of the canal-
displacing the Israelis from their
first Sinai defense lines also
appeared to give the Egyptians
their own bargaining cards for any
Arab-Israeli peace talks.

The Israelis said their push into
Syria. which began ill the end ofthe
first week of fightingin the Golan
Heights, left them with 370 square
miles of land beyond the lines es-
tiiblished when they captured the
heights from Syriti in I967.

The Syrians disputed Israel's
control over that much Syrian
territory. Iiut they made no claims
of holding any significant amount
of the Golan Heights land their
tanks retook when the war erupted.

The unfavorable position in the
field was viewed as a possible
reason for Darnziscus' hesitation in
deciding whether to accept the
Security Council cease-lire.

Iraq. which along with Town
and a number of less powerful
Arab nations had sent troops to
bolster the Syrians. announced
ovcr llughdad radio it would not
