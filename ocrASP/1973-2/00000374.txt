Antonlnns, will be reading at
SUNYA this’l‘uesday afternoon at
4500 pm. in the Humanities
Lbunge (nu-354). The event inan-
der English department and ESC
sponsorship. '

Everson, a wildly colorful and
dramatic figure, stands alongu'de
West Coast poets Robert Dunno
(whom SUNYA students may
recall having read here two years
ago) and Kenneth Rexroth apart
of the uncalled "San Francisco
Renaissance"; writers whose ini-
mersion in sensuous and mystical
modes of knowledp and ex-
perience made than the spiritual
fathers of the Beat Generation in
the I950's and I960's.

Everson's most recent volumes
of poetry are: The Springing of the
Blade (I967, The Rose of Solitude
(1967). Single Source (1966). The
Hazards of Holinesr (1962). and
The Crooked LinesofGod(l960)r

The book that introduced him to
national notice, in the late I960's.
was The Residual Years: Poems
I 934-1948. It covers ywrs working
as a laborer and lumberjack. then
an “inexorable incarceration" in
the Waldport Camp. one of three
conscientious objector detention
camps'r where Everson passed the
years of World War II. There are
poems about his lempcstuousber—
sonal life (two marriages); in his
own words, he wrote “a poetry of
physical celebration and tortured
sensuality.”

During the Brother Antoninus
years. l95l-l969. he wrote (“It
wasn‘t until I entered a coherent
body ofbclief that my poetry began
to have real content"); and he
worked. with the Catholic Worker
movement in the prisons and on
Skid Row. '

Then about four years ago. he
asst oil" the robes of the order-
literally. and in front of an
audience. during a reading at U.
Cal, Davis.

0f the post-mouncry years.
Everson says: “I began once again
to take up the theme of mysticism
in nature and I began to under-
standlhat it was the Indian who
held the key."

Now at the age of sixty one he is
poet in residence at U. Cal.. Santa
Cruz; he has married againand has
a son.

Last Friday night, University
Concert Board recorded its ﬁrst
sellout of the semester with its
homecoming weekend offering of
John Mayall and Dr. Hook and the
Medicine Show. Some 2800 people
attended. making it the most
successful gym concert since Sha-
_Na-Na in I971.

The evening's music started off
somewhat uneventfully with the
appearance of Dr. Hook. Ex-
hibiting a tinge of country. a dash
of boogie. ands wholelot of top40,
Hook led his crew through a 45-
minute set to the distressof most of
the audience. Although this band
does possess a good degree of
musical talent. the crowd just
didn‘t appreciate the corny humor
and the cheap Ihcatrics which
prevailed. It's it good thing there
weren't any tomatoes on hand...

John Mayall was an entirely
different story. The hand featured
the musicians from Mayall's last
non-anthology album. Jazz-Blues
Fusion and chf Hartley on
drums. ti member of the old
Illucsbrctikcrs. Mtiyall opcncd
with it quick rendition of Room to

Jeremy:

Real, Sad And Funny

by Steve Klein

The Hellman‘s Colonic Center
Theatre is presently showing a film
entitled Jermti'. It is a youthful
film depicting a love relationship
between two young (and very
believany so. by appearance. not
ability) high school students in
New York City.

Jeremy. portrayed by Robert
Benson (who many of you will
recognize by commercials he has
done in the New York
metropolitan urea. like Vita C
Colri. for whatever this bit of
triviality is worth). is it sixteen year
old htindicztppcr who loves horses
rind who always picks the winners
but never bets. .Icrcmy is tilso u
cellist in the school orchestra who
sorncdtiy aspires to go to Jurllirird
illld become it great musician. His
most inncr thoughts and emotions
are expressed through his music
and it is his friendship wttli his ccllo
IL'tIL’lIL'I’ that we first get an insight
into the warmth and depth ol the
hero.
