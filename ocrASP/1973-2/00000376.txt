Danes Rally

hy'Bruee Maggln

With the darkness slowly setting
in on the campus. the Albany State
football team stopped two Curry
drives in the closing minutes to
preserve a 28-20 victory for the
Danes.

It was a sweet victory for Coach
Ford and his team as they recorded
their ﬁrst varsity victory against a
varsity team.

It was a tough haidhittinggame.
very similar to the Nichols game.
Albany was able to eat up large
chunks of yardage but the CUFFY’S
defense proved almost im-
penetrable inside the twenty.

Albany started the game in
familiar fashion as they took the
opening kickoff and scored seven
plays later. George Hollie took a
pitchout from John Bertuzzi and
scampered 66 yards down the
sidelines for six points.

The Danes got the ball amost im-
mediately back after the defertse
stopped Curry. It looked like the

Siena game all over again when
Bertuzzi made the same call as the
previous scoring play with Hollie
this time going 73 yards down the
sidelines for what looked like a
score. Unfortunately the play was
called back on a clipping penalty
and the Danes' fortunes quickly
changed. 0n the next play Bertuzzi
fumbled and Curry recovered the
ball on Albany‘s sixteen. Three
plays later quarterback Jim
Ahearn found Mike Shaddeck in
the end zone for a 6—6 tie.

Albany continued its sloppy play
in the next series when Bertuzzi
once again lost the ball on another
fumble. The Danes got the ball
back and started marching up the
field. ﬁnding many holes in Curry‘s
defense. But as the Danes found
out all afternoon. Curry‘s defense
was like a stone wall inside the
twenty. This drive was stopped via
an intercepted pass. On the next
series Albany stalled on Curry‘s
nine and had to settle for a field

Albany's rushing game once again led the way.

Curry took the ball and for one
ofthe few times the Albany defense
wasn't sharp. especially in pass
coverage. Quarterback Jim
Aheurn mixed up his plays
beautifully and marched his team
right up the field. Much of the yar-
dage was picked up through the air
as Albany's zone coverage left
Curry receivers wide open. The
Coloniels took the ball over from
the four for a 13-9 lead.

Albany had two more drives
before the half ended but Curry's
tough defense stopped Albany
twice inside the Coloniels‘ twenty.

The second half started with
Curry once again moving the ball
as they drove to Albany‘s thirty
yard line. But the Coloniels were
stopped on a fourth and six when a
blitzing Rudy Vido came bursting
through to tackle Curry‘s quarter-
back. Albany took over and once
again got good yardage but were
stopped on a fourth down play on
Curry‘s eleven.

'l‘he Danes got the ball back four
plays later after a (‘urry punt to
their 48 yard line. 'I be whole com-
plexion of the game turned with

Row Over Fem Sexism Spreads

by Jill R. Cohen

in the wake of the growing con-
cern over sex discrimination. a re-
cent article by Al Thompson. a
junior at SUNYA. brought into
focus a relatively unnoticed exam—
ple of what he fell to be fcinalcsex-
ism on campus. Thompson. who
had enrolled in a Women‘s Studies
course. ENG 3|}.and wtistlic only
male in the section taught by
Judith Fettcrley. was asked by
Fetterley to refrain from
dominating class disciiSsions on
the grounds that “it is their (the
women‘s) course." lhompson
chose to drop the course tind.in his
columit iil l-ridzi}, October l2.
questioned l‘ctterlcy's rationale,
lhc following week Ms. fretterlcy
responded iii a lettci to the cditorin
which she claimed that possibly
"..,rcail quality in education for
women will have to take it form
which superficially appears as

uppci lctcl langlish course and
hecitusc Women in Literttttiic
seemed to be an interesting course
which might raise his coit-
sctotisncss of women‘s roles. lvle

despite the fact that ilic other two

sections of ENG 313 both con-
tained male students.

Thompson elaborated “lf Ms.
Fetterlcy‘s issue is that before
women can deal with males. they
must get themselves together. then
my sympathy and support is with
her...however. the classroom. ENG

males who register for these
