Association has charged that the
arrests of student leaders during
demonstrations last Nov. 16 at

‘ Southern University were respon-
sible for the subsequent death of
two students.

“All evidence points to the con-
clusion that the untimely and ex-
traordinary arrests robbed the
demonstrations of much of their
effective student leadership...and
were the immediate cause of the
confrontation that ended in death
on the morning of Nov. 16.“ the
NEA concludes in a 62-page report
summarizing the organization‘s
six-month investigation of last

year's violence at Southern Univer-
sity‘.

The decision by universiton—
ﬁcials to initiate actibn which led to
the arrestof'ludent protest leaders
and the ﬁring of two teachers'stems
from a tradition of authoritarian
central and exemplifies the nature
of Southern‘s deeply rooted
problems, according to the NEA
report.

In making the report pubic.
NEA President Dr. Helen D. Wise
described the problems at
Southern, outlined recommen-
dations for changes at the universi-
ty, and indicated how the NEA can
help students and teachers bring
about change on the campus.

     
 
 
  
  
      

 Blames '  Arrests
 I For'SOuiIiern 'Univ'.‘Deaths

The NEA report points to con-
trol of Southern University by an
all—white State Board of Education
and inadequate financial support
as the underlying causes of student
unrest on the campus.

The opinion has been expressed
by the governor of Louisiana and
otherslthatthetragedy atSouthern
was a controversy where blacks
were protesting against blacks.

The NEA report states that
although the president and ad—
ministrative staff at Southern
appeared to be the immediate
targets of student protest. “much of
the substance of thatl protest in-
volved matters over which the un‘
iversity administration itself has
never had control.“

The conditions of all-white con-
trol and inadequate ﬁnancing
reflect the tradition and the con-
tinued reality of institutional
racism at Southern. according to
the report.

Also. these conditions dis-
tinguish the student protest move—
ment at Southern from protests of
white students at predominantly
white universities.

Awareness Focuses  Tenure

by Sue Lebofl'

SUNYA can‘t be considered
totally apathetic. Apathy includes
an inability on a community‘s part
to unite against threats to its in-
terests. but at Albany State there
are some things which unite
students.

Students are dissatisﬁed with
tenure in. its present form.
Students are opposed to both in-
creases in tuition and decreases in
financial aid. The student who is
complacent about tenure or would
be willing to pay more for his
education is a rare bird.

Whether the strident voices of
protest that were raised last May
over the lcnurc issue will rcvccho
tlrrsycrrr Is not yet certain. lint it is
a sale bet that it a solution to the
complaints about texture is not put
lor'iyrrr'd. Ilicrc'll he more
demonstrations and the like. A
student group is ittst now orgrrnil-
ing around the tenure issue.

'I o conic tip with a solution and

N’S CRAFT FAIR

A project that. whether or not it
affects tenure decisions, is likely to
spark student interest is a
university-wide evaluation of
teachers. Hopefully by the end of
this semester. a group of students
including Ms. Natansohn will be
distributing forms to claSses. The
forms will be identical for every
class in every department. and on
them will be direct questions about
the course and the teacher. The
answers to these questionnaires
would then be published and sold
to students.

A similar project was carried
through in l9o7—I968. One
professor recalls that then. teachers
used to keep copies hidden in their
desks. in covertly pcrusc wlicnthcy
ucrc alone. Ms. Nathanson says
the group putting together the
book needs more help. and asks for
students to volunteer.

FIGURINES

.Strong forces, including Nixon
and Rockefeller, ,are actively
pushing for revisions in the ﬁnan-
cing of higher education. revisions
that may squeeze middle incoriie
students.There has already been a
start at organized opposition
within the StateUniversity. The
President of the Student Associa-
tion asserts that he would en-
courage vigorous united student
action against raising tuition and
lowering financial aid. This is a
prime concern of S.A.S.U. as well.
On campus ii is a more dormant
issue than tcnurc. but it is poten-
rially even more explosive.

Despite being involved in these
areas. the campus is not. involved
