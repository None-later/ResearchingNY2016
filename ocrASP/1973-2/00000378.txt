Central Council‘s most recent
meeting was comparatively quiet.
Two appointments. Joyce Feidler
Assistant Comptroller and Ken
Stokem as S.A.S.U. Coordinator-
were approved:

Whether by coincidence or not.
Council decided not to appropriate
money in two separate cases.
Dutch Quad did not get funds it
had requested fora telephone. and
the Associate Editor of the Torch
was denied the $300.00 stipend
Finance Committee had approved
for him.

There is an ongoing controversy
in Council over what exactly
Council's role is in dealing with
political issues outsidethe campus.
The question never gets resolved.
Arguments and long drawn our
discussions about it take place
periodically. on an average of once
each Council meeting.

What sparked this
episode iii the debate was a bill in—
troduced by Ira Hirnhaum, Ken
Stokcmiind Barry Davis callingon
President Nixon to resign. 'I'hc
very strong bill. which called for
impeachment should the President
in his poor judgment fail to heed
the will of the Central Council. was
defeated. IIowever. members of

week's

it In -:‘We¢l Session

council successfully petitioned. for
a referendum to ascertain how the
students feel about Nixon.

In the course of debate on the
bill. Chairpe'rson Eric Lonschein
read from the preamble of the Stu—
dent Association constitution. “To
provide for student expression of
moral. political. and'social con-
cern.." This would indicate that
politics is Council‘s constitutional
concern, but at least one Council
member has said at a previous
episode of the debate. that Coun-
cil‘s sole reason for existence is to
distribute the student tax.

Some niembersasked how coun-
cil could speak for-the students
without first polling them. Barry
Davis replied forcefully. “I believe
if we haven‘t been capable over the
last week of gauging the opinion of
the students. than ‘ >
ing iIL'I'L’ t
speak ltit'tltt: sir... . itttittld".

But at the sit me time people were
arguing over whether Council
could speak for the students. it
wasn't even clear whether Council
was speaking for itself. Lonschein
expressed serious reservations
about asking for the impeachment
of a president. ()ne memberstated.
“I |iist don‘t want to impeach my
President"

In the past two months. Council
has voted to "support the boycott of
non-union label lettuce. to ask for
restoration of Health education
and Welfare funds to the Carver
Community Center. But the
debate over whether Council can.
or should speak and act for the
students iii addition to themselves
in political matters continues.

An ad hoc committee to deal
with the chronic student dis—
satisfaction with Food Service was
established by unanimous vote.
One of the committee‘s numerous
responsibilities will be to “Make
recommendations for permanent
structures that would eliminate or
at the very least alleviate day to day
grievances about Food Service".

Before Council adjourned. it
heard the ﬁrst appeal fora waiver
ofthc student tax oftlte year. but. if

A. predicted. not the last. The girl
had already been granted a liaff
waiver in committee. but she felt
site was ctititled to a full waiver.
Speaking forcefully and argumen—
tativcly. with histrionics that some
members of Council found amus-
ing. the girl fought in vain for her
$Io.(lt). Council upheld the corti-
mitiee's decision. and then ad—
jourtied.

NEA Blames Deaths 

contlnued from page 2

“For when southern University

students complained about their

exclusion' from the policy deter-
minations that shape university
life. they were speaking to ad-
ministrators who are themselves
excluded from full and effective
participation in those defer-
minations at the highest levels.“ the
report says.

“They were speaking toa genera—
tion of Southern black educators
whose entire life experience has
taught them thutsubtlediplomacy,
accomodation. and at least out-
ward deferenoe to a white power
structure are the key components.
not only of the advancement of
black education. but ofits very sur—
vival.“ the report adds.

The report charges that
historically the all-white State
Board of Education Iias operated
Louisiana's black college on an
“irreducible minimum of tax stip-
port." I

This system of financing.accor-
ding to the NEA report. resulted in
the setting of rigid limitations on
career choices available to blacks
and forced black liberal arts
graduates itito post office and in-
surancc collecting jobs.

All-white control and resultant
poor financing has “imposed on
the black college student a sterile.
conformist. educational ex-
perience" and does little more than
"educate him for "good citi/enship'
iii a society that. in reality. exclud-
ed Ititii from full ctti/cnship." the
report states.

lti another section of the report.
the NIiA charges that students
Iiavc no adequate machinery for

the resolution of grievances anda re
provided no right of due process in
the strident disciplinary proccd tires
at Southern.

The largest movement of people
in the history of peacetime aviation
will take place next week. as
thousands of followers of Guru
Maliaraj .Ii coirverge on the
Iloitston Astrodome for what has
been billed the “World Assemblage
to Save Humanity.“

Thirty jttmbo jets have been
retaitted to transport disciples from
around the world. and first week a
caravan called “Soul Rush“ began
to take shape iii Boston. hopefully
attracting thousands of followers
as it passes throrigli major
American cities on its way to the
Astrodontc.

T his is what will happen next
week if the expectations of the
organizers of “Milleriiutn ‘73"
cotire true. (luru Maharnj .Ii.
whose promise is to bring world
peace. is convening the inter-
national comoetition to announce
a concrete plan for ending human
suffering and to usher iii ati age of
peace. His estimated six million
followers claim he has a gift that
cart transform the htrtnan race and
that he plans to offer this gift in
Houston.
