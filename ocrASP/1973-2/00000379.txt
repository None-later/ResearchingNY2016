' by John Christ

Due to recent federal court
orders more students than ever are
now eligible for food stamps.

The Food Stamp Act of [964
was designed to enable low-income
households to buy more food. of
greater variety. to supplement their
diets. Participants pay a small
amount of money based on
household size and monthly in-
come. for which they receive food
stamps equivalent to a largcrvalue.
which'are used to purchase food.

Many people who are eligible for
food stamps are unaware that they

qualify for this government Iargesst
which they support with their tax
dollars.

Eligibility is determined on the
basis of households: a family or
otlter group living together and
functioning as a single economic
tinit. A single economic unit isonc
which pools its resources andjoint—
ly buys things necessary to the
household. such as food. to be held
and itsed in common by all the
members of the household.

Until recently. a household was
defined by public welfare ofﬁcials
as excluding groups of unrelated.
unmarried persons. Last April the
United States District Court in
Northern California redefined
"household" as an economic iinit in

common living quarters which
shares common cooking facilities,
and customarily purchases food in
common for homeconsumption. A
telegram subsequently issued by the
Food and Nutrition Service ofthc
Department of Agriculture to at
public welfare ofﬁces in the coun-
try ordered compliance with the
District Court ruling.

The California ruling coupled
with a I972 restraining order for—
bidding welfare ofﬁcials to deny
food stamps because the members
of a household were unrelated. has
greatly increased student eligibility
for food stamps.

Households of unrelated per-
sons rejected under the old rules
may reapply . but welfare ofﬁces
are not required to notify then of
their eligibility.

Applicants are responsible for
proving their eligibility
qualifications under the new food
stamp regulations.

Households also must meet
other qualifications to be eligible
for the program:

Applicants must meet a net in-
come limitation computed by
deducting certain mandatory ex—
penses according to a standard for-
mula from all money received by
household members. except
students under Ill.

Shelter costs of more than J0 per
cent of the household income as
calculated after all other deduc-
tions should also be deducted to
calculate the net income, The final
net income ﬁgure is the basis on
which ﬁnancial eligibility is deter-
mined.

The limits for net monthly in-
come allowable under the food
stamp program vary with the
number of persons in the
household. The limit for one is

for four. $387; for five. $460; for
six. $533. for seven $600; for eight.
$667; and for each additional per-
son. add $53. The limits are higher
for Alaska and Hawaii because of
higher food costs in those states.

Households are required to not
have over SISOO in resources. in-
cluding liquid assets. and nonli—
quid assets. such as land. Excluded
are: a home; one carand unlicensed
vehicles; life insurance policies;
income-producing real estate
though you have to count the iti-
cortie elsewhere ; vehicles needed
for employment; and other
resources such as the tools of a
tradcsnian and farm machinery.

All members of the household
between the ages til I8 and 05 who
are able-bodied must register to
work. with the exceptions of
mothers or other members of the
household who have to take care til
dependent children under I7 years
of age; students whoarc enrolled at

How to Apply

The head of an eligible
household must complete an
application form and an interview
at the local welfare ofﬁce. Certain
documentary evidence should be
presented at the interview which
shows: where the household
resides. how many are in the
household: how much income they
have: what resources the
household members havczand how
much they are paying for rent.
medical bills.child care. education.
utilities. and other expenses.

If the welfare ofﬁce agrees that a
household is eligible to participate
in the program. the household is
awarrlcd food stamps according to
the number of persons in the
household and the net income. The
rumber of persons in the
household is crossmatchcd with
the net income figure to ﬁnd the
amount of money which must he
paid for the monthly allocation of
food stamps to a household ofthat
si/c. for instance. if there are four
people in the household. the
monthly allotment is always $I Io.
II the rtct income til the household
Is SISS. the cost for SI to worth of
loud strirnps will be $4l a month.

It the welfare office does not
agree. the head of the household
can demand a “fair hearing." 'llie
local welfare ofﬁce is obligated to
explain the procedures of ob-
taining a fair hearing to all
applicants for food stamps. and
must also assist the household in
making out its request and prepar-
ing its case for presentation to a
hearing authority.

Ihe hearing authority is a
higher-ranking person within the
welfare hierarchy. It may he the
highest-ranking officer of the state

News Analyﬂ
by Robert Mayer

No one has to be told that for.
this country these are not normal
times. It may be difﬁcult to deﬁne
what the norm is but it is certainly
evident that strange things are
happening. They are happening
with great speed. and they are
bringing a steady flow of confu-
sion. worry. rhetoric . and all the
other reactions of men
overshadowed and overwhelmed
as they are absorbed by crisis.

So it was not odd to wake up
yesterday morning and learn that
every United States military base
from Turkey to Fort Dix. NJ. was
on a full alert. while the Strategic
Air-Command was ready at the
President‘s notice to drop a wtpc-
otit front the bosoms oftheir flying
machines.

llut all this followed other days
of climax and trauma. Days that
saw Vice President Agnew. a man
who symbolized America's spirit of
hard. rightous work. moral
courage. a man who was John
(ilenn. (ieorgc Washington. Billy

Graham. Archie Bunker all in one.
stand humbled before a US judge.
guilty of betraying millions who
believed. however faintly. in the
worth of the American Dream.

And suddenly. as if God‘s wrath
was being hurled on the occupant
of I600 Pennsylvania Ave.. came
the devastating succession of
events that made Archibald Cox
the hero and Richard Nixon a
villian.

Nixon‘s popularity plunges to
20A For the ﬁrst time in the 201h
century a majority of Americans
favor impeachment. Judge Siraca
is about to hold the President in
contempt of court. The congress
goes full steam ahead on impeach-
ment. George Meany. representing
over I] million labor people calls
for Nixon's resignation. Western
llnion is flooded with thousands of
tclcgramscallingforimpeachment.
newspapers from New Orleans
(bypassing Manchester NH.) to
Oregon dcrmnd resignation or im-
peachment. The country is more
fired up over Nixon and his handl-

Mid-East-

ing of Watergate than any other
Administration action in ﬁve
years. Nixon agrees to turn over
the tapes. The crisis is only tem-
porarily and partially settled. The
question of his guilt is still in the
air.

Thousands of miles away a
cease-ﬁre is reached and violated
while the World watches the United
States come closerand closer to the
"brink" with the USSR.

The Watergate crisis and the
President's reaction to the Mid
Fast crisis may more than just
overlap in time. The more atten-
tion focused on the Mid East. the
less on Watergate. Fora President
whose survival parallels Watergate
developemcnts. the world crisis.
may have been a welcoming oc-
currenec.

There are those who will read
this and immediately dismiss this
notion as Nixon hatred. paranoia.
or rhetorical garbage. maybe all
three. llut underlying this notion
is the single fact that in spite ofthc

USSR‘s claim before the UN that

they will not send their troops into
the war front. the US still is on a
full stand-by alert. While there is
no evidence that the intent ofthc
USSR was to promote a confron-
tation with the US. as of this
writing the [President of the US
has taken what Kissinger called
“precautionary measures“ that
clearly go beyond a warning for the
Russians to stay out..

Kissinger spoke yesterday of
“annihilation.“ He talked about
this alert in terms of "future
generations." How can we in-
telligent humans even think about
Presidential misconduct when the
world is faced with “annihilation”
and the future of mankind may be
decided at this point in time.

Richard Nixon did not manufac—
ture the Mid East war. He did not
even mantifacturc the still vague
eveitt that prompted the alert. He
did not manufacture the cease-ﬁre
breakdown. But 2! than who is
desparatcly in need of saving

while. When the President sends

press in Dr. Strangelovian terms of

The tension in the Mid East is
real. The threat of world wide
confrontation exists simply
because the US supports Israel.
Russia supports the Arabs and
Israel and the Arabs are at war.
The concern expressed in the Un—
ited Nations is not totally
