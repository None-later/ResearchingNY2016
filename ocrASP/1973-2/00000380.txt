WASHINGTON AP — Denying
that the White House is “playing
with me lives of the American peo-
ple." Secretary of Slate Henry A.
Kissinger icin rejected any sugges-
tion that Thursday‘s ’Mid'East
developments were staged to
obscure the still-boiling Watergate
affair.

President Nixon postponed until
Friday a {10915 conference for
questions about Watergate. even as
new scandal disclosures surfaced
and Republicans in Congress
stepped up pressure for a new
special prosecutor.

The White House said Nixon
was too busy with the Middle East
to hold the news conference plann-
ed for Thursday night.

Kissinger. speaking at a State
Department news conference. was
asked wltether domestic problems
Iiud prompted Nixon to call
I‘hursday's early morning military
itICtlt.

“We arc attempting to cortduct
the foreign policy ol the United
States with regard for...futurc
generations." he said. adding:

"It is a syrriptorn of what is
happening in this cotintry tltat it
eycn could be suggested that the
United States would alert its lorccs
tor doiitcstic reasons.“

.\t another point. he said. "There
has to be a minimum of conlidcnce
that the senior oll’icials of the
.‘\lIlUflCiIII goycrnntcnl ill’C I’IUI

larger responsibilities than solving
their -par1icular “crises in higher
education.“ according to the con-
cluding report of the Carnegie
Commission on Higher Educa-
tion released October 9.

Summarizing nearly six years of
study and deliberations. the Com-
mission sketched broad guidelines
for a socially just and ﬁnancially
stable post-secondary educational
network of the future. The Com-
mission included hundreds of
speciﬁc recommendations aimed at
implementing these goals.

“Survival. with memories of past
glories. is not enough ofa program
for higher education as it ap-
proaches the year 2000." reported
the Commission. 'Nor is it enough
for society as it relies more and

The production of State Univer-
sity Theatre‘s Mary Stuart last
week was notable for the many
problems it presented - both to the
actor and to the general theatre-
goen Written by Friedrich Schiller
in the eighteenth century, the play
was based on the reign of Elizabeth
I and, in particular, on the tur-
bulent events surrounding the ex
ecution of her sister Mary. Queen
of Scots. On face value. then. one
might wroneg construe Mary
Stuart to be a strict historical
chronicle. but It“:th

lhe difliculty here lies in thc lact
that Schiller has taken great Iibcr—
tics with his material. and has riot
only twisted thc facts. but has. in
some cases. fabricated cycnts [and
L'lttll'actcls) ltl conform to Ills
philosophical and aesthetic ideals.

In scclong to recreate the Itidor
urn. S'cTtiller relied on the use of
lengthy and involved speeches and
far more y'crbalizing on motivation
and intention than iiiodcrii
audiences are used to. .As a result.

In attempting to capture the world
Schiller recreated. Director Al
Wiener sought to achieve a roman-
tie mode of acting. treading the
thin line between its effective rendi-
tion and its several pitfalls - namely
those of over-stylized acting and of
the “pontiftcating” to which inex-
perienced romantic actors are
wont. Unfortunately for the show.
these shortcomings are not
