Chess

_—

Ever since the beginning of
chess. players have been
confronted with the problem
of winning won positions.

Too many players have
fallen into the trap of believ-
ing that won positions will
win by themselves. and that
any old move ought to win.
Unfortunately. this principle
has never been true. The
player with the won position
should try to simplify into a
favorable endgame. while
preventing the opponent
from getting too many
counter chances for attack.

Conversely the player with
the inferior position whould
produce complications and
try forcounter attacks. in the
first game. white gets a good
game after the opening. but
allows black to get some
oounterpluy by carelessly
trying to simplify too

suddenly.
