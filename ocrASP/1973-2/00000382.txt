Chaplin once again deﬁed motion
picture industry convention and
produced a silent ﬁlm nearly ten
years after whole-sale conversion
to dialogue ﬁlms.- In I934 it was
rumored that Chaplin did shoot
some test sequencesdn an attempt
to outfit they famous r tramp,
character, a unionism: soon
g'l er up the. whole idea as 
tdgedoomed. ‘; ,Ctiarlie ' was .b’o’m if
silent, it Was thrdughi‘silence'tlidt he 
bicame s universal‘ﬁgure. and '
silpnt he would remain. Except for 
a short song Chaplin sings in com- 
plete gibberish near the end of the 
movie. dialogue is heard in '
MODERN TIMES‘ only from
loudspeakers and television
screens.

 

In the more than thirty-five years
since its original release.
MODERN TIMES has become
perhaps the most popular of the
Chaplin ﬁlms. Although ﬁrmly
rooted in the Depression period of
the mid-thirties, this satire of mass
production and its effects upon the
lives of factory workers has taken
on the aura of a timeless classic.
Challenged only by Rene Cltiir's
brilliant l93l comedy. A NOUS

TIMES remains thedefinitive ﬁlm
on the suhiect.

Actually. MODERN. TIMES is
concerned with a good deal more
than assembly lines. Some
criticism has been made" of the
ﬁlm's alleged lack of thematic uni-
ty, since we are presented with a
half-hour of Charlie in the factory.
then Charlie in jail. Charlie as a
night watchman, .as a singing
waiter, and so on. To this point of
view (which was widely voiced at
the time of the ﬁlm’s original
release) the effect is one of several
sequences which. clever as most of
them are, fail to add up to a uniﬁed
whole. What is overlooked by such
criticism is that the very matter of
day-to-day suvival always a strong
underlying current in Chaplin's
work, becomes in MODERN
TIMES the ceiitralconern.and in-
deed the very theme of the ﬁlm.
This was not only singularly ap-
propriate for the America of I936.
but also contributes no doubt in
large share to the film‘s remarkable
refusal to become dated.

MODERN TIM ES was to write
the final pages in twu very impor-
tant chapters of motion picture
hiStory. It was the last American

  
 

 
 

 
  

 

 
  

     
  
  
    

  

 

silent ﬁlm. Only Chaplin had held
out'for pantomime as a unique and
valid form in which to tell a screen
story. But now it had become near—
ly impossible to ﬁnd performers
who could act in the silent screen
style. The tradition had crumbled
around him and with his next pic-
ture, THE GREAT DICTATOR.
Chaplin came to terms with sound.
As the tramp character is inherent-
ly a silent one. it became necessary

that he be retired. Charlie, who
had during the previous twenty-
two years become the most famous
ﬁgure in the world, would be seen
no more.

Although audiences of the time
could not have known it. the sight
of Charlie and the young girl walk-
ing down the road in optimistic
hope of better times was to he the
final fade-out on inﬁnitely more
than a single film.

Why is “Billy Jack" one of the
most popular movies of our time“!

“Billy Jack“ is an honest movie.
Torn Laughlin and Dolores Taylor
star as the half-indian Billy Jack
and the anti—violent teacher of a
Freedom school. The story centers
around both sides ofthc generation
grip: its message is the hypocrisy of
America. the stupidity and lies
creeping out of Washington and
the need for compassion as well its
understanding bethcn people so
that life can survive.

Rex Reed compares “Billy Jack"
to the Culley case. the tight for In-
dian affairs. returning Viet Nam
Vets.etc. “Itspointscnmcthrougli
because it is an honest. loving lilm
that teaches peace through ii way ol
life so meticulously detailed in the
eyes of its chartictcrsand situations
that you get into the lilm and be
part of it....'l'hcii' problems and
