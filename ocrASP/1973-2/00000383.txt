Guest Editorial
Silence at Our Own Peril

Constitutional government in the United States may have been
suspended at 8:00 p.m. last Saturday night. President Nixon now rules
by ﬁat and force. He is no longer a legitimate leader.

With callous disregard for his oath of ofﬁce and the intents of Con-
gress and the Judiciary, the President first refused to abide by a court
order to produce Watergate documents. He then forced the resigna-
tion of the Attorney General and fired his Deputy and the Watergate
Special Prosecutor when they refused to condone his conduct.
Moreover, the President abolished the ofﬁce of Special Prosecutor and
dispatched the FBI to seal off their records. These decisive and un-
precedented actions represent the tactics of a military coup. They are
anathema to a rational democratic policy.

Even before these steps were taken, public conﬁdence in the Nixon
Administration’s ability to govern was at one of its all-time lows. Now
this support will deteriorate still further. The mandate of I972 has been
buried in a legacy of illegality, hypocrisy and deceit.

When elected ofﬁcials violate the sacred trust placed in them by the
people, the Constitution provides means for them to be impeached
and, if convicted, removed from ofﬁce. These procedures are very dif—
ﬁcult to implement and are seldom used. But if our were a parliamen—
tary system of government, the Nixon Administration would have
fallen months ago.

in the past, Mr. Nixon has cloaked his actions in aveil oflegality, but
now he has bared his intentions to f oresake rule by law. The President
must be impeached. No amount oflegal double-talk or political timidi—
ty can obscure this fact. The question of his past culpability is almost
moot. He is willing to maintain the Watergate cover—up at any cost.

There is real question whether the Congress and the Judiciary can
force Richard Nixon to deal with them within the conﬁnes of the law.
But our actions, for the moment, must be based on this premise.
Members of the academic community have a special responsibility.
They must articulate the principles which are at stake. They must im-
press upon CongreSsmen and other national leaders the gravity of the
current situation and their duties under the Constitution. Most impor-
tantly, they must communicate the strength of their convictions to the
public-at-large and join with others in a nationwide struggle for the
preservation of democratic rule.

The methods of response are numerous. Now more than ever. we
must write our Congressmen. The balance of mail over the next few
days will be crucial. Massive public expression ofdissent-no matter
what form it takes- is equally important.

The weeks ahead could represent either the redemption of American
democracy or the prologue to its collapse. We remain silent at our own
peril.

WASHINGTON - When Word came down

last week that the I973 Nobel Peace l’riic
would go to Henry Kissinger and Le l)uc
'lho. one of my British friends turned to me
in mock disbelief and said. “'lhat‘s sort of
like givingit to the IRA for showing restraint
by not blowing up all the train stations in
London."

His remark captured the tenor ofthc reac-
tions of many. both in Washington and
around the world, who viewed the selection
asa sham. Said former Deputy Secretary of
State George W. Hall. “The juxtaposition of
Henry Kissinger and II: l)uc'l‘hoslioWstliat
the Norwegians must liiivc a sense of
humor."

And. indeed, the very best that can be said
about the decision in inyjiidgcincnt is that it
was inappropriate. The selection of Dr.
Kissinger and Mr. llio does no honor to the
award. which has come to he recognized as
one of the highest honors the civilized world
can bestow upon an individual. While there
is no doubt that the contributions of
Kissinger and Tho to the negotiations which
helped bring an end to American involve-
merit in Vietnam were significant. the fact
remains that the negotiations took place in
the shadow of some of the most vicious and
unnecessary blondletting in the history of
that gruesome war. And the fighting still
goes onzif reports are to be believed. South

Washington:

Peace Prize?

 

 

Victniiin casualties today are still as high as
in many of the “war years.“

And while the Peace Prize committee‘s
avowed hope is that itsaward willcontributc
to a final. lasting peace in Vietnam. the fact is
that thc oppostie effect may ensue. for the
Norwegians will liavccrowned with the pri/e
of peace the very policies which nourished
the conflict for more than a decade.

Yes. the war seems nearly over. and yes. all
parties involved are to be commended for at
last showing the common sense and good
judgment to stop the barbarity. But let us
not forget in the euphoria of our gratitude
that there were many who believed not
without justification. that this bloody
business could and should have been prit
behind its long. long ago. And to crown its
late arrival with the Peace Prize may, in the
words of Dr. Henry Z'Stcelc Commanger.
give “a sort of retroactive autliori/niion to
wars of that kind."

Perhaps l)r. Kissingerand Mr. Tho could
make a noble and useful contribution by
jointly refusing the prize, a small gesture of
personal sacriﬁce on their parts in recogni-
tion of the tremendous losses which this war
brotight to all involved and in hopcthal what
happeiicd in Vietnam-the tragic wrongs of
both sides-will not occur again.

lid. i‘iotc: l.c l)uc 'l ho has refused the pole.
athoiigh Kissinger is still planning on going
in Oslo to accept.

To the Editor:

Clearly no student can advance the con-
icniion that he has not become immensely. if
not completely. disillusioned with many of
lllt,‘ governmental and public spheres within
this country. Rarely can a student pick up it
newspaper and not read about Watergate.
Spiro Agncw. presidential impeachment, or
police corruption in cities such as New York.
Jersey City. and even in ourown beloved city
of Albany. Such atrocities. appearing more
and more frequently. are now unequivocally
present within the Campus Security. Prior
to last week I had the utmost respectandird—
miration for this department. Howcvcr it
was nof until last Friday night that l iii-

seconds to produce identification. wliichtlic

officcr. grasping his shield in one hand and
clenching the other is a fist before my facc.

proceeded in turning over the papers rc-

and commitment to help women in their

this goal does not correspond with his com-

been seriously concerned with learning
about women in literature. he would have
remained in the course accepting a “docilc
