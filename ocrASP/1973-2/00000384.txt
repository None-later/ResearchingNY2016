Don't Save the Bond

As in November of I967 and l97l, we are
once again faced with a Transportation
Bond Issue. Known as Proposition One. the
bond calls for a creation of a state debt of
$3.5 billion the largest bond act ever propos-
ed. which over a thirty year repayment
period. will cost between 55.9 and $7.3
billion (depending on whose figures you
believe). ultimately rcsultingin highcrtaxes.

Of the $2.5 billion allocated by the I967
Transportation Bond Act. $622 million of
the mass transit money remains committed.
but unspent. Why has it taken six years (and
maybe more to carry out mass transit pro-
jects. when highway projects were carried
out with unprecedented speed?

The l97| Transportation Bond Act for
$2.5 billion was dccidedlydefcatcd. Perhaps
one would think that the voters did not want
another bond act for economic reasons. yet
the next year the I972 Environmental Bond
Act was passed by a 2 to l margin.

While it is true that the Environmental
liond Act represents a new concern for and
commitment to our environment. it also is a
clear. well written bill. with precise
mechanisms for spending its monies.

the I97] Transportation Bond Act lacks
most of these precise mechanisms. In fact.

must be part of or consistent with the
Statewide Masterplan for Transportation.

nor Rockefeller has recently announced that
the surplus will only be $52 million, while
Comptroller Arthur Levitt insists that it is
somewhere between $300 and $400 million.
Obviously, there is st. rte controvertiy s‘é‘r’é 
the exact amount. ‘ i

In addition, many of the highway projects
listed in the Statewide Masterptan for
Transportation. Volume Law in direct con-
ﬂict with guidelines set forth in the Statewide
Masterptan for the Environment. Alrca‘dy
tltcrc are fartoo many miles ofconcrcte facing
the state. From an environmental stand-
point. the answer liesin mass transit, but not
as proposed iii the I973 Transportation Bond
Act.A rejection of Proposition One will not
mean a rejection of mass transit, but rathera
demand for a better. more realistic plan for
mass transit. with less emphasis on
highways.

 

Altttough not completely without taudibte
intentions, the (973 Transportation Bond
Act is a basically unsound. stop-gap
measure. with far too many shortcomings to
warrant its passage.

As a member ofa Greek organization on
this campus I am tired of listening to and
reading about people who are continually
ptitting down (irccks. twill agree withthesc
people that there are times when members of
lraternitiesand sororities get loud and crude.
but I would also like to mention that other
"people" on this campus also “resemble
animals" when eating in the dining halls.
More often than not. it is theseindependcnts
that start food lights in the cafeterias. Simp-
