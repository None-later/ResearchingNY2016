‘ Impressive Danes Readying for Brockport

by Harvey Kojen

There are many factors in-
digenous\ to a ﬁne football
team. and after Albany State's
impressive 28-20 victory over

these significant indicators

became readily apparent. One
of the most important is that
the Danes displayed the almost
intangible capacity to “come
from behind." something they

it is really amaling how one y no
can rriakc a world of a difference.
Last year at this time. the Albany
State soccer team was lanquishing
with a miserable 1-9 record and
praying for a quick and merciful
end to a disasterous season. This
year. the hooters are 5-3»l
.ttrrcludiirg Wednesday’s win versus
.r strong l’lattsbttrgh team) and
eagerly look forward to their up-
coming major battles \sith
lirockport (home this Saturday)
and Union (Wednesday. away).
l'his Brockport grime rrrearis to the
booters what last season's
Brockport game meant to the
basketball team: a must Win for
post season play.

Let's return to the l'lattsbrirgh
game. lhe Danes and l’iattsburgh
were two evenly matched teams,
each of whom had to writ to stay
illl\L' tn the SUNYAC races. Whert
the clock ran out the scoreboard
showed. Albany 2. I’lattsburgh 0;
shots on goal Albany 2ft.
l’lrittsburgh 4. which bring to rnrnd
that rtcri Albany soccer phase.
l)ane Domination.

lhe game itself was more even
than the stats seem to indicate. as
the hall score was it 0—0 tie. Strong
Albany drives were being turned
back. as the l’iattsburgli goalie
stopped l5 shots. while the Dane
defense kept i’lattsburgh from
even vaguely finding the range.

When the second half began it
qurekly became obvious that the
first learn to score would win - it
was that type of all or nothing
game. first team appeared to be
l’lattshurgh. when a quick drive

caught ()bwald out of the net. and
the ball r'ollingtowardsthat gaping
goalriiotith. it looked extremely
dismal tortlrc Dane fans —when out
of the clear blue sky (or right
fullback slot to be more exact).
Mark Solano came flying iikea bat
out of hell to catch up to the ball
and steer it aside.

Solano is one of a handful of
veterans on this year‘s new Danes.
and he is also one of the best. last
year, Soliino anchored the only de—
ecnt tliiirg on the soccer field. the
defense. ilris year, he isthe veteran
the defense is built around, arid lie
combines with Selilegel itrrd
Aldrich to form one of tire finest
defensive iinits iii the league.

Alter a play like that. it would
have been a shame if l’lattsbrirglr
had scored. l-oitiinately, that play
sparked the Dunes. and when
i’lattsbnrgh committed a foul. they
were burned by Johnny Rolando

wlio knows?“

Some mid-season stats of iii-

('nnflnued on page N

had not bad to prove within re-
cent memory. As Coach Bob
Ford put it, “1 think that every
team in sports develops a per-
sonality...one ofthe traits some
teams have is the ability to
come from behind, and l was
exceptionally pleased with the
team's ability to do just that."

Another of these factors is
one of the most overused sports
cliches of all: the ability to
“come up with the big plays."
With the Danes in front by a
scant two point margin late in
the fourth quarter. Tommy
DeBlois fumbled on ﬁrst down
within the Albany 35 yard line.

On a recent set ofdowns. Curry
had moved slowly but convin-
cingly down the field, finally
connecting for a touchdown
pass. thus making ita very close
contest. With the Danes defense
perhaps tired from that
previous drive by the oppostion
(they had begun to weaken
noticeably in controlling the
run). it seemed the ideal situa-
tion for a game-winning
touchdown or ﬁeld goal. for lit-
tle time would have been left
for a subsequent Danes tally.

However, the defense “stuffed
theminlfourplays"accordingto
Ford, and the Danes quickly
added the insurance score on
long runs by Marvin Perry and
DeBlois.

One of the more evident

aspects of this game was the
complete dominance and

overall excellence of theAlbany
ground attack, which ac-
cumulted 540 yards against a
defensive unit with extremely
high credentials. For example.
the 28 points scored against
Curry wtha'e most in over th rec
years. True, the Danes had“ run
up such vast totals before, but
there is a marked difference in
rolling up big yardage against
Curry as opposed to Stony
Brook. Siena. or any of the
other less-endowed defenses
faced this season.

A rather intriguing matchup
exists this week for Albany, as
they face Brockport. one ofthe
two teams they did not defeat
last season en route to a 6-H-
record. However, last year‘s
game was an enigma. for it was
obvious from the start that the
Danes were a much linerteam
both offensively and defensive-
iy. In fact.the atmosphere in the
clubhouse after the
13-13 tie was one of a losing
squad, and not one which stiltr‘
possessed an undefeated
record. This game could be
quite different.foritisdoubtful
(and reports from Brockport
confirm this) that the Golden
Eagles have improved as much
as the Danes. noris it likely that
they can stop the vaunted
Albany ground machine that
Curr could not contain. The

are not a fancy team. probably
by need rather than design,and
attempt to overpower the opf
postion '
with a running game concen-
trated on the middle. it
remains to be seen whether
Brockport can pick up the four
yards per carry necessary to sus-
tain such an offense.

An Albany weakness which
cropped up last week was their
vulnerability to the short
passes over the middle. especial-
ly quick pops to the running
backs. Again, whether the
GoldenEagles can exploit this
will only be answered when
they take the field this Satur-
day. The basic strength that
Brockport has going for them
is. unlike Curry and Nichols.
that they have good. agile out-
side linebackers and ends.
necessary to stifle or at least
slow up an outside ground
game.

Look for a game similar in
many respects to the Curry
game. except that it should not
be as close. However, with
thcl)rines susceptible to mis-
takes and fumbles, and with
Brockport solid in offensive
potential. the game may be as

.clos ' as many have predicted. if

you can‘t get lolhc gameiit‘s in
Brockport. mind you). local
coverage will be on WSUA
(640). Saturday afternoon.
Prediction: 3444.

The Boaters face tough Brockport tomorrow afternoon.
