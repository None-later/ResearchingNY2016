PIRG: A Worthwhile Cause

The primary thrust of the current campaign is to obtain financial support for the
research operation. NYPIRG is asking the SUNYA student body to approve the in-
clusion of an optional $2 fee on their semester bills. This money will go to support the
costs of running the operation and paying the professional staff working with the
organization.

We urge support of PIRG and applaud the intentions of its leaders. At the same
time. however. we urge caution and watchfulnessthat the organization doesn‘t go the
way of the very evils it is challenging. The slogan “fight power with power" is a little
frightening in light of what power can do to a nation. an organization. a man.

The campaign goes into the classroom this week as NY PI RG takes its plea for sup-
port directly to the students (see story on page one). With thccooperationof in-
dividual instructors. class time has been allotted to PlRG representatives to explain
their program to the student body.

PlRG presents a structure within which the student can voice opposition to and
affect working solutions for corporate mismanagement. environmental abuse and it
virtually boundless scope of other social. ethical and economic problems.

Touhey for Mayor

The Albany Student Press endorses Carl Touhey for Mayor of Albany. Although
none of the candidates measure up to what we consider the standards necessary for
thejob. Mr. Touhey seems to represent the least undesirable of the alternatives.

Vincent Bytner, the independent candidate. simply cannot be taken seriously. and
he seems to be using the campaign more to advertise his travel agency than to raise
serious issued of concern to Albanians.

Mayor Corning‘s drawbacks are obvious. He has been Mayor since I943. and now
pretty well controls the machine formerly run by the O'Connells. There is no place
for machine government in modern day America. The problems confronted by our
cures are too monumental to be dealt with by the classic machine. but require an
enlightened. independent administration. This is what Corningis unableto provide.

Carl Touhey promises a “justified” city budget. an end to machine practices. rind a
general democratization ofthe governmantal processAlthough he has not propos-
ed major plans of his own. he does represent the first credible challenge to Mayor
Coming in 30 years. and for this reason deserves support.

The Party's Over!

Halloween is here again. It is an appropriate time to comment on the state of our
leadership in Washington. because they‘re all at a masquerade. You see. that manin
the oval office who always says. “I am the President“ is actually Willie Stark. And
Henry Kissinger. the popular guy in the administration. is none othertban Rasputin.
himself. Bet you didn‘t know that.

lhesc guys are very enthusiastic about Halloween. so they began their tricks and
treats a little early this year  a few dirtytric ks Ior‘ (icorge Mc(iovernand company.
and some nice treats for I'I'T. the Dairy Industry. and other friends.

Brit all holidays must come to an end. and the kiddies must go home to be on
Halloween night. Such will happen to our mrisqueradcrs in Washington oncfthe
neighborhood cops catch thewindovt soapers arid pumpkinsrnashcrs. The fun will'be
over,

Arab Awakening

To the Editor

One of the many things Israel is doing in
the Mideast conflict concerns the awakening
of the Arab masses to the flaws in the
governmental characteristics. The people of
the Arab lands have been blinded long
enough. It is time that they see the corrup'
iron in their governments. takca firm stand.
rind join in the restoration of mankind.

Unfortunately the majority of them have
not cycn riwrikcncd to the malice and mis-
direction of their own leaders and
governmental structures. Again they have
been shocked and thrown into it new war.
Hopefully this time they will begin to ques-
tiort tltc direction of their own efforts in per-
stiltzil terms. l’crhrips tltcy will realiie the
plundering of their own resource and stop

merely as a political tool of the Arab leaders
whose speciﬁc design was intended as a lever
to keep the Middle East in turmoil.

To trace the Palestinian problem, we must
go back to I948 when small groups of Arabs
living in the U.N. partitioned sectors fled
from their homes out of fear created by a
conspiring Grand Muffti whose most noted
photograph was taken in smiling com-
panionship with Adolf Hitler.

Fleeing from their homes into the desert
they were not met by concerned kinsmen.
but rather by a wall of superstitious ig-
norance and international politicians. The
governments seeing the plight of the im-
rnigrrintst'!) did not eagerly welcome them.
Instead they placed camps for these fearful
people on thc most desolate arid barren
stretches of their land rind gave them no aid
