The Personified Pipikin

by The Professor

Pipik. or in the plural pipikin. or more
colloquially. “navel.“( not as those military
forces which patrol the oceanic aqua pura.
but rather like the infamous belly button) is
indeed a subject of great worth and merits
further study.

Let us consider the term pipik - not as the
linkage that. in our congential development
linked us through the umbilical cord and the
amniotic gunk to our mother. but rather as
the physical focal point or. if you will. the
“center of gravity"of ourselves.

It is obvious that pipik is a cross—cultural
term. being found in such far away cultures
as the Japanese where I believe it is called
"hara". or the yiddish where it is called
"pipik." or the french where it is alternately
called “‘nombril." "centre" or “coeur.”
Cultural attitudes towards this appendage
vary however. for. in such cultures as the
French of Japanese where the name is syn-
omous with heart (coeur). belly (hara) or
center (centre and ham) one ﬁnds an ap
propriate amount of affection lavished on
this “\estigal" part of the organism. (as one
does not find in America. Fond ofdieting.

chefs as “Swanson” (T.V. Dinners).

We are all familiar with the expression
“Button your mouth“ which refers to the

to an excess . or the term “button” itself‘

knowing the truth of KNOWING OUR
BEl.l.lES! We want to button it up as if it
never existed. belt it to push it away. and
avois it in nearly whatever apparel we wear.
We lack neither the linguistic means for ad-
monisliing love as the French or Japanese
have or thejovial physical manifestations as
the Italians and (iermans (whose loves of
beer and pasta are often prominently dis-
played) have. Rather we detest out poor
pipiks and postnatally push them away. For

by Dan Gaines

When I first came to SUNYA as a
freshman, someone told me that each of the
quads had a stereotype. Alumni Quad was
full of cagerbeaver freshman and was the
most "together" of the Quads. State was
famous for partying. and had a jockish
character. Gay people congregated there
also. Colonial was studious, serious. and
apathetic. Indian was the home ofthefreaks.
intellectuals. and pseudo-intellectuals.
Dutch. being the home of fraternities and
sorieties. was into institutions. I guess these
stereotypes were as accurate as you cart ex-
pect any stereotypes to be. but I thought that
there must be some real differences beiweeri
the different Quads.

I‘ve been livingjon lridiari Quad. and. and
at the risk of beingcalled a chauviriist. I must
say that there are things about Indian that
makes it tnore distinctive. If not better. than
the other Quads. Some differences are ob-
yious It is well known that Indian is the
newest of the Quads. having been finished in
I970. On any rirglit you cart seethirr the tower

therefore called a skinroom. There are pretty
white pebbles instead of dirt. and Ilenway‘s

Indian Quad combines the atmosphere
of Alumni with the convenience of fit ing up-
town. Most of each hall uses a hall
bathroom. and as a result has art espirit de
corps of the highestquality. In the other up-
town quads you get to know your
suiternates. but may go a full semester
without knowing the re s of the Irall. Many

Thompson Resolution

To the editor:

Amid all the controversy about my article
“The Feminine Mystique." hopefully this
"self" clarification will be my “amen” on the _
subject.

Willing to take on all attacks from any
angle as to my dedication to the Women‘s
Liberation struggle or my sincerity. let me
make one thing perfectly clear. As an op-
pressed minority (black) I know what op—
pression. exploitation. racism. is and have
faced and fought it. (Where were you people.
watching it on eyewitness news?) However
this experience doesn‘t make me hate white
people or segregate myself. I sincerely
believe in the later Malcolm X‘s philosophy.
which after his trip abroad. was to give peo-
ple a chance to prove themselves. not to cor-
ner them first. If this philosophy is for
humanity and the benefit ofall then coin me
a "liberal" or “Mr. NAACP."

I told Ms. Fetterlcy. personally. before
dropping the course I wculd write an article
and would do so again if iii the same situa—
tion. While I do not care to discuss my per-
sonal reasons for dropping the course. if I
was so benevolent as claimed I do want to
state I may take the course next semester
hopefully with other interested males.
Again. I support the notion that before
women. blacks. indians. etc. interact outside
of'tltcir peers on key issues they must reacha
sense of solidarity. rid themselves of self
hate. mobilize. then seek allies. I support
equal opportunities for women in the Educa—
tion Field. equal job opportunities. equal
marital union. and the hiring of morelemale
staff members. Segregation of sexes in a
public institution. the classroom. is not legal
or triorally binding. The concept of "separate
but equal" has proven to be disasterous. For

me to promote such segregation ofthe sexes
is to promote and support sexism and
despair. This is something I will not do.
Mobili/ation outside of the classroom is
both legal and effective. The Equal Oppor—
tunitics Act forbids discrimination. and so-
called rcterse discrimination whether by sex
or race. lhis section of the law obviously
applies also to women. and all minorities.
l‘or vtomen to be given all women classes
vtould mean all minorities at SUNYA.
would demand the same options. Such a
fatal move would jeaopardi/e not only luri-

The Controversy Continued

Retirements and non-reappointments of
persons who have not reached a mandatory

of the University. Such policy has an impor-
tant impact on individual faculty members.
and therefore on students and potential
students of affected faculty. Many faculty
and most students see the issue as a conﬂict
between individual rights and institutional
efﬁciency - an opposition which predisposes
almost all of usto side with individual rights.
But before dealing with the qtrestion of what
rights are involved.ii is important tourrders-
tand certain facts about the operation of the
tenure system. and the practical conse-
quences of certain policies.

Statewide University policy. in confor-
mance with American Association of flu-
iversity Professors guidelines. requires than
no individual serte as a full iirne faculty
member for more than sctcn year's ttrtliout
receiving tenure. SUNV policy further rev
quires that faculty sening ti icrrii appoint-
merit of more than two years duration be
notified by May | of the nc.\t to last year of

allow for the possibility of correcting a mis-

be no barriers to reconsideration. if. for eit-
ample. acandidate who had previously listed
a major work as “in progress" or as “sub-
mitted for publication.“ is able to announce
that the work has been accepted for publica-
tion by the Oxford University Press.
However it ought to beclearthat there is no
right to an automatic reconsideration -even
though it is a privilege that may occasionally
be granted. It is also worth pointinglout that
the right which we at SUNYA now take for
granted - that of self nomination of faculty
for promotion and tenure. and of carrying
their case to the highest levels even without
departmental support — is of very recent
origin here. and. to the best of my
knowledge. does not exist at other major un-
iversities.

This article could end here. except that the
question is how to make the existingsystern

most casual reader of the ASP knows that
there are those who feel that good teachingif

that many senior faculty and administrators
are sadistic authoritarian incompetents who
delight in firing potentialcltallengcrsto their
potter and standing. and that Marxists and
an odd collection of other dissenters
(“historians of the west“) are denied
academic freedom. If such statements are
it ire. then the kinds of damage to the Univer-
.\II_\ which would result front rccogniIing an
automatic right to reconsideration are mild
in comparison to the atrocities which are
non being corriinittcd.

A recent story in the ASP suggested that
Professor Joe Jenkins of the math depart-
ment got tenure last year only because of
some specialinfluence exercised by the math
department. While I would like to believe
that my own department has achieved a cer—
tain credibility with the Promotions Council
and the Administration for the integrity and
conscientiousness of our recommendations.
I was myself naive enough to believe that
Jenkin‘s tenure and promotion had
something to do with the fifteen or so papers
he has written. his invitations to speak at
several international conferences. the
detailed comments on the signiﬁcance of his
Work supplied by eminent mathematicians.
the uniformly enthusiastic recommen-
dations of students. the unanimous respect
and support of his colleagues. and his invita-
tion to spend a year at the Institute for Ad-
yiiriccd Study in Princeton.

llttisc who feel that Ill non-tenured facul-
ty \\cl'c “purged” last year might do well to

Jenkins. did rccciw tenure.

Some of the latter group may haye real
