Garvey And DuBois

In the opening days of this cen—
tury. when black power was an un-
heard of term, two men dedicated
their lives to ending the opression
of the black community and restor-
ing its racial pride. Although to
some observers Marcus Garvey
and W.E.B. DuBois may have
appeared to speak for single cause,
their methods and goals were as
different as their backgrounds.

ln MARCUS GARVEY . the
youngl ' Jamaican who sought to
set'up an Africanempireemerpms
_the“Messiah"of Negroes in the
l920‘s. E. David Cronon‘s portrait
of Garvey reflects his unique in-
f luence on members of his race who
believed the dream of “economic
independence and self-respect.”
contributing thousands of dollars
to his all-black steamship'line and
his fund for the rehabilitation of
Liberia.

Maneatiny Lions

The maneating lion is uni-
que among Africa's
prenators both in its diet and
its single-minded pursuit of
its main stapleman. The
November SCIENCE
DIGEST reports there are in—
cidents of maneaters ram-
ming through a herd of cattle
to attack the herdsman or
clawing their way through
the walls of native huts to at‘
tack people. Tracking and
killing such beasts is a
tricky and dangerous job
writes wildlife expert
George Frame. l-Iis
SCIENCE DIGEST article
chronicles the "careers" of
infamous maneaters and
how they were eliminated.

Johnson views Garvey's "African
schenie"as an important factor in
his failure. declaring that the
“American Negro recognized the
plan as impractical and fan-
iastic...that could ultimtely meet
with nothing but failures
However, according to Robert
Highes Brisbane. Jr.. it was has
“overslndowing' of American
Negro leaders which led to (hr-
vcy‘s “career in America ﬁnally en-
ding with a prison term and depor-
tation“ on chargs of mail-fraud.
stemming from his ill fated
steamship venture.

W.E.B Du Bois edited by
William M. Tuttle. Jr.. examines.
through DuBois' own writings and
those of observers. the life of the
man who served for 24 years as the
voice of the N.A_.A.:C,'I’. His
editorial accusing the group he

, ‘ of r" L' _, a
“little less than nothing“ in a 25
year ﬁght for integration is com-
pared with his later stand in favor

of complete segregation as a means
of preventing blacks from losing
thsir identitv.

DuBois‘ advocacy of Pan-
Africanism, his rejection of in-
tegration and his Marxist beliefs
led to his resignation from the
Crises in I934. a move which left
him “far from the battlefield when
his side started winning." says
Francis L Brodercik. His race
consciousness. which Tuttle claims
“began to germinate in
adolescenceand burst in full bloom
at Fisk University.“ instilled in him
a sense of black nationalism.
Before his death at 95. Dubois ad-
mitted that progress in civil rights
“has hastened."but he also warned
“the great end comes slowly.
because time is long."

Sunday night past the vivacious

breviated due to the lute arrival of
the fourteen piece band. butthc sc-

nine-piece band came out bobbing

Black Ghetto Goodness

Before I commence on my
necessary embarkment of
sincere and loving transcrip-
tion. please acknowledge my
earnest wishes of successful-
ly communicating with you.
my “BLACK GHETTO
GODDESSES". For as I sit
here. with pen in hand. my
thoughts beinqgto drift like a
slaveship on unknown
waters. in the direction of un»
known lands. As the ship
docks. the melodic beats of
distant drums and hearts
cease. and it is then. that I am
taken to the nearest com-
pound. Alas. I begin to
realize how much I truly
need you and want to be with
you. my queen. [also realize
that I may never see you
again. Indeed. I shall truly
miss you. I shall missthc un~
believably cold and windy
nights at sea that we spent
together. I shall miss our bed
of rusty steel chains and
shackles. I shall miss the
coarseness of the salt-laden
wooden planks of the ship's
bottom. I shall miss the taste
of your tears you shed when I
was subjected to the
chustisement of the sup-
posed “Children of God". I...l
shall.,..I shall miss....l shall
miss you.

The year is 1973 and the
price of cotton has gone up
and up and up. The “Ships of
Sacrilege" no longer carry
the bodies of great warriors
across the once unknown
waters. A new type of bon-
dage has been initiated.

There is still the presence of
servitude and meager
rewards. There is not much
hope and consequently there
isstill the unkind hands of
fate that we must deal with.
We are truly in one helluva
mess.

However. now we are at an
advantage. We can not be
separated physically. Of
course. this leaves the pay-
chological aspect. Ex: AST-
'I‘ROLOGY.

Why is it that a Scorpio
male is incompatible with a
Scorpio female? Why is it
that a Virgo male can't “cut
the mustard" with an Aries
female?. Frankly speaking. I
can think of no reason other
than that perhaps one of
them is usingr the wrong
toothpaste, If we can only
learn to feel one another
rather than touching one
another. (if you can dig it)

Yes. BLACK WOMAN.
amd you also. my comrade
brothers. We have been the
victims of carefully planned
exploitation and systematic
tricknology. I'll grant you
that there is supportive facts
to this science of Astrology
and horoscope analysis.
However. are we so narrow-
mindcd as to deny one a
chance? Do we refuse one the
chance to prove otherwise
the characteristics of malig-
nant aspects. that onc's sign
may dictate? Must we be
"turned off“ by basic theory
or shall we walk hand in

Joplin And Gershwin

by Bob Rierlnger

Nonesuch Records is un-
doubtedly the friend and savior to
the classical enthusiast with a low
budget. Nonesuch albums are
now dominating the classical
record charts and with good
reason. The quality of the recor-
dings is comparable to that of the
non - budget labels' and the regular
retail charge is usually

at a price extreme attractive to
cvcryonc‘s pocketbook.

lhe music in the Nonesuch
catalog ranges fromthal oflhc pre-
Baroquc perios through modern
and electronic music. While the
offerings in the Romantic period
are rather meager. u baroque al-
l'icioniido would have a field day

devoted entirely to the music oflhc
Hub and l7th centuries. For those
who have it particular interest in
certain forms ofinslrumcnts. Non-
csuch has albums concerned with
diffcrcnl specialties such as The
Baroque 'I'umpﬂ or Four ('rn-
Iurir'i ri/ Ilarp Music.

One specialty Nonesuch is
currently selling very well is the
piano rag music of Scott Joplin.
lhc success of its Piano Rugs Iir

Vol. 2 ( ll - 7I261)has generated a
renewed interest in rags and pop—
ular music of the early l900's.
Joshua Rifkin. a talented per—
former. arranger. and conductor.

bringing forlhlheappcalingnalurc

most Iamous piece. the “Maple
lciil Rag." along with “The
Riigtimc Dance" and “Scott
Joplin's New Rag.“ Volume 2.
although it presents lesser known
composuions is probably the more
lively oi the two albums. opening

sound best when played between
four and six in the afternoon or
after II P.M. These times seem
