Harriers Take Third In Invitational

by John E. Koch

There weren‘t three thousand
fans giving Albany's five senior
barriers a standing ovation; a
farewell banner wasn‘t even
thought of. Probably few people
even know that State has five
senior runners. and even fewer
realized lltat last Saturday‘s
Albany Invitational was theirfinal
race on tlte home course. Such is
the nature of different sports.

The followers of Great Dane
cross cotintry were aware of tltis
fact: tltey alsti knew that the
'- .Vlunseynien were ready for the
home finale. And with the field iti-
clttding national class runners.
everyone anticipated art exciting
day. It was.

Student Assembly has been formed
tti act as a medium through which
SUNY students may participate in

information between University
students. the Chancellor, and the
Board of Trustees. which is the
legislative body of the SUNY

meeting of Student Assembly will
take place here this weekend.
November 2-4. First on the agenda
is the establishment of procedures
for electing officers and the Eir-
ecutivc Committee.

8 AS U Successes

Some success has already
resulted from student lobbying
that was organiled by SASU. For
example. a tuition hike of up to
ISM dollars per year was
prevented by student lobbying of
higher education. Also. students
were allowed to sit inon Board til
Trustees meetings for the first time
last year. Now. SASU is attemp-
ting to put a student representative
on the Board.

The greatest development of
SASU has thus far taken place iii
the area of student services. The
largest program is that of student
“Purchase Power." This is a

Insurance

A whole range of insurance
plans ts being offered to SUNY
students through SASU. One is a
$l0.U()ll lift: insurance policy at $20
a year. the cheapest rate in the
country. Another plan is that of
tuition term insurance from the
Beneficial Insurance Company.
This policyinsuresastudcnt that in
case of a parent's death. he will be
guaranteed sufficient money to
cover his tuition costs. In the
workings is an improved statewide
health insurance policy which
would be offered at a cost ofS42-45
per year.

Several other programs are also
tn the planning stages. SASU
hopes to have it tax—card reciproci-
ty program worked out by the mid
die of next semester. This would
allow at SUNY student it) use his
tax card at any SUNY campus.
two or three college centers have
already begun such a program,
SASU also hopes to take advan-
tage of block bookings for concert
artists. This would allow SUNY
campuses to obtain better per-
lormcrs tit cheaper rates. At pre-
sent. Jim Mossgmber. Director of
State-Wide Services. is involved in

“primarily on the basis tifits poten-
tial.“

Prof Association Reject Quotas

the American Association of
University Professors today issued
a statement rejecttngthc concept of
tenure quotas. Such quotas are a
dangerous approach to the
problems of faculty staffing in the
nation's colleges and universities
and a serious threat to academic
freedom. the nation's largest
professional organization of
college and university teachers
warned.

“Establishing fixed quotas." the
AAUP said. “may deprive the
profession of a large part of the
generation of scholars and teachers
which currently populates the non-
tenured positions at our colleges
and universities. It would be
preferable by far to employ avzirie~
ty of other measures - some affec-
ting tenured faculty. others affec-
ting probationary and nontenured
faculty. and still others affecting
prospective faculty members - to
ensure that the necessary burdens
of financial stringency and luck of
growth are shared to some extent
by all academic generations."

The AAUP warned in its state-
ment that institutions could tinder-
mine functions of tenure standards

it they provide that. no matter how
excellent at tiontenured faculty
member may be. he will not be
able to attain tenure because ofan
arbitrary quota.

“Foreclosing promotion to a
tenured position because of a
numerical quota is unacceptable."
the Association said. “Stricter
standards for the awarding of
tenure can be developed over the
years. with a consequent decrease
in the probability of achieving
tenure. But it is essential to dis-
tinguish a deliberate change in
standards. retaining a positive
probability of an individual's
achieving tenure pursuant to well-
defined criteria and adequate
procedures for reasons unrelated
to the individual‘s merits. is nevera
realistic possibility."

The AAU P said that the general
proportion of a faculty on tenure
can have important long-range
bearing on the nature rind quality
of art institution of higher educa-
tion. The Association culled atten-
tion to the following con-
siderations in dealing with the
proportion of tenured and non-
tenured faculty at an institution of

higher education where the total
sll.t.' of the faculty is not growing.

- The dcsncd distribution of
tenured and nontenured faculty
should be viewed as a long-term
goal rather than a short-term solu-
tion.

- A satisfactory long-range plan
may well imply that. alongthe way.
the proportion of the faculty on
tenure will at first increase and
then. as the force of the plan takes
effect. decrease. On the other hand.
long-range injury to an institution
may result from rigid and hasty
application of any single presumed
remedy. such as the imposttion ofa
fixed quota.

- Reducing the proportion of a
faculty on tenure produces very lit-
tlc short-run benefit by way ofﬂexv
ibility,

— Equity. and institutional
morale. demand that all or almost
all of the burden of satisfying the
desired tenure ratio should not be
placed upon the probationary
faculty. Attractive accelerated
retire tnent opportunities for senior
tenured faculty present one possi-
ble alternative.
