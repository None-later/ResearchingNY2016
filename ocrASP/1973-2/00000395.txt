State Audit Hits Westbury

by Chris Oberle
SASU Press Service

Two announcements from
Albany within the span of one
week have rocked the administra-
tion and the student body of the
State University College here.

An audit by the State Con-
troller‘s Ofﬁce has uncovered
numerous ﬁnancial irregularities,
and a statement by the Board of
Trustees has ended the school's
status as an exclusively experimen-
tal institution for disadvantaged
and older students.

A study conducted by the ofﬁce
of Controller Arthur Levitt in-
dicated that more than $97,000 in
supplies were purchased by Old
Westbury without allowing for the

competitive bidding required by
law. It also was disclosed that
thousands of dollars of mandatory
activity fees could not be ac—
counted for. and that at least $2.-
000 in student loans never were
repaid.

In general, the report blamed the
six-year—old institution‘s business
office for the abuses. Lax security
in the library and unsanitary con-
ditions in the cafeteria also were
criticized.

Old Westbury President John
Maguire did not deny the audit's
ﬁndings. He admitted that the
business ofﬁce “tried to do too
much” with too few employees.

The 66-page Controller's report
was issued just one week after the

State University Board of Trustees

announced that the role of the
college was to bedrasticallychang—
ed. A revision of the master plan
calls for Old Westbury to switch
emphasis from its commitment to
minority group, disadvantaged.
and older students to a new
program in the liberal arts. Next
year the school will become Long
Island‘s first public four-year
liberal arts insitution.

The college currently enrolls
l000 students: 42 percent black, l9
percent Hispanic. and 39 percent
white. The median age of students
is 29.

The new program, when it is ful-
ly implemented in I980, will raise
enrollment to 5000. The majority
of students will be liberal arts ma—
jors. and many of those will be
graduates of two-year istitutions.
Four-ﬁfths of the students will be
commuters.

Old Westbury students have
reacted to the new policy with little
enthusiasm. Senior Michelina
Fitzmaurice commented: "It‘s
ruininga very good idea. Iwon‘t be
affected. The people who will be
hurt are the incoming students and
those who just won't get here."
Other students and faculty
members also were skeptical that
the college's commitment to
“traditionally bypassed" students
would remain the same.

Roll Up Your Sleeves... 

by Ken We}

There‘s something you can do
this coming Tuesday. It‘ll take
about 45 minutes of your time, and
it good deal more of your psyche.
What I'm talking about is com-
pletely free. and. if you‘ll forgive
my corniness, is perhaps the
biggest thing you can do to help
yottrfcllow man. I‘m talkingabout
giving blood to llrc Red Cross.
Yeah. giving blood.

Now. why should you possibly
want to give blood'.’ First of all. it
costs you nothing, your body will
i'cplacctlrc blood yoti give in aboirt
34 hours. and you‘re going to save
\oirrcoric‘s life.

Saw it lrfc" lhosc are pretty
\ll'tlllg uords. And irrrdcrrinbly
lr‘uc lllootl is one ol those things
that l. l & l. inst doesn't rriakc.
llrc only way sotrrcbody iii a
hospital can get the stuff. and
thereby stay alirc. is if you gi\c it.

Yeah, you!

The reasons for feeling hesitant
about donating blood are varied.
Any psychology major can give
you several. It‘s something you‘ve
never done before. You‘re taking
something out of your body. For
someone you‘ll never know,
someone who will never personally
thank you.

Let‘s look at who‘ll be getting
your blood. A victim ofa carcrash.
A baby born with a blood disease.
A hcrnophcliac teenager. And
these aren‘t just statistics. The peo-
ple who need your blood to stay
alive arc real people - somebody
clsc‘s mother, father. sister or
brother. Real people who are irri-
portant to others.

Why should you be the one to
goc'.’ Because. Because ifyour pint
of blood isn‘t available in the
operating room there's no place to'
turn. You could give blood for

purely selﬁsh reasons. If you
donate, you and the members of
your family are covered for blood
needs for one year. You may need
blood in the future. And every stu-
dent that dOesn't “have time" to
donate could bedeciding your fate.
But that‘s not why you should want
to give blood this Tuesday. You
should want to give because it‘sthe
most unselﬁsh thing anyone could
do for his fellow human being.
The students of Rykman Hall
are sponsoring the blood drive this
coming Tuesday. November 6. We
are taking appointments so that as
little ofyotir time as possible will be
rakcn tip. Come to our table in the
Campus ('critcr today or Monday
from Ill to [2 and make an ap-
pointment. The Red Cross Blood
Mobile will be here from If) to 4 on
lticsday the 6th of November. It's
your chance to do something really
important for someone else.
