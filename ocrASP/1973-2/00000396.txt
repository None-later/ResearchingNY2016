original charges “untrue” and calls
he entire controversy that has
erupted over the status and training
of peace ofﬁcer: a “momumental
non-issue.” Williams claims there
is no real problem over the legal
status of peace ofﬁcer training
some of his ofﬁcers have received.
and adds his belief die the SUNY—
Albany peace ofﬁcers are legally
entitled to that status.
Senate Committee Reports

Williams contention appears to
be supported by a soon-to-be
released resolution of the
University-Community Council. a
SUNYA University Senate com-
mittee that was directed by the
Albany State L'niversity President
to study the security issue.

The resolution slates. "From the
review and examination made by
this bod). there is no indication that
the eleven men on the l niiersiti.
Police Force authoriled to carry
arms on campus are not legally cer-
tified to do so "

But the issue remains clouded
because the Counctl did not deal
directly with (terber‘s speciﬁc ac-
cusation that the men designated
“peace officers" at Albany and
other campuses had not completed
a required eight week New York
State Municipal Police Training
Counctl course. A member of the
Council explained the oversight in
these words "The Councd did not

fhc developments at Albany
have been overshadowed by the
chain of evenisthat have erupted at
other campuses.

At a Sll‘lY Buffalo open hear-
ing on arming. Graduate School
Dean Mc:\llisler Hull stated that
l,niversity President Robert Ketter
has dectded to authori/e his securi-

ty department to selectively arm
two plainclotbes security ofﬁcers
on each shift of duty.

Action in Buffalo

The announcement triggered the
occupation of Ketter‘s office by
about 70 students. who charged the
decision had been made without
proper student consultation. The
sit-in ended after Ketter threatened
the students with arrest.

A student group. calling itself
“Students Against Armed Securi-
ty." has now formed on thecampus
and is protesting the adoption by
Ketter of the recommendations
offered by the Committee on lntcr-
nal Security. lt isthesc recommen-
dations that Hull had outlined zit

The student group met later with
Ketter to discuss the problem. A

Stony Brook President John

io‘the Stony Brook Statesman.
H_0_WCVCI'., he also rcafﬁnned an
earlier position that ‘under the pre-

the Council recommendations did
not constitute a commitment or a
presumptio that arms would be
issued on campus. and later stated
that university police would not
bear firearms this year

The CounCil‘s recommendations

The statement which follows was
approved by the Association's
Committee A on Academic
Freedom and Tenure on October
I8. 197}. The Councilvotedon 0c-
tober 20, I973, to concur in the
statement.

Committee A. in registering its
concern over the fixing of a max-
imum numerical percentage of
tenured faculty. does not suggest
that an institution should be un»
concerned with appointment
policies which will permit it to br-
ing new members into its faculty
with some regularity. A sound
academic program needs elements
not only of continuity but of flex-
ibility. which is served by the con-
tinuing opportunity to recruit new
persons. and to pursue new
academic emphases. It is desirable
for it faculty to include those
recently arrived from the seminars
of our graduate schools as well as

those who are well established as
scholars and teachers.

Such considerations of flexibili-
iy are often adduced in support of
tenure quotas. But this misses two
central points. First. the system of
tenure does not exist as subor-
dinate to convenience and ﬂexibili-
ty. The protection of academic
freedom must take precedence over
the claimed advantages of in-
creased flexibility.

Second. imposing a numerical
limit on the percentage of tenured
faculty disregards a range of other
ways to attain a desired mix of
senior andjuniorfaculty. Indeed. it
imposes anincquitablc burden ona
vulnerable portion of the faculty in

academic staffing ihtit should

planning It would be preferable by
far to employ a‘ variety of other
measures - some affecting tenured
faculty. others affecting

department from granting the can-
didate. tenure.

Obviously this runs directly in
contrast to the spirit of the policy
as established by the Association.

Vice President for Academic Af-
lairs Philip Sirotkin has repeatedly
stated that this llniict‘sity does not
llllVC. nor ever did have. a policy
that included the criterion of
tenure quotas llic charges made
against this have been too
iiiiiiici'uiis to ignore. 'l’he Associa—
tion states that establishment of ii
icniire quota actually runs counter
to the expressed aims of those who
approve of such a system. namely
that it would provide for it more
fluid faculty. In fact. claims the
Association. “reducing the propor-
tioti of flexibility." They call lorthc
use of visiting faculty. and
graduate assistants as well its
tenured and non-tenured faculty to
accomplish this aim.

The Association eitds its
lengthy report by warning to all Ad~
iiiiiiistrtitions lhlll excuse their
policy of tenure quotiis. "li is'esscii-
titil to distingish ti deliberate

positive probability of an iti-

probationary and nontenured
faculty, and still others affecting
prospective faculty members - to
ensure that the necessary burdens
of financial stringency and lack of
growth are shared to some extent
by all academic generations.

While opposing the imposition
of tenure quotas. Committee A
recognizes that the general propor-
tion of a faculty on tenure can have
an important long-range bearing
on the nature and quality of an in-
stitution of higher education.
Given a situation in which there is
small prospect for signiﬁcant
growth in the total size ofthe facul-
ty. considerations which merit
attention include:

A. The desired distribution of
tenured and nontcnured faculty
should be viewed as a long«term
goal rather than a short-term solu-
tion. The ratio oftenurcd faculty is
itself the dynamic consequence ofa
complex ofactidcmic decisionsand

developments. each of which can
be reconsidered. These include I)
the rate of growth of the institution
and its faculty; 2) the fraction of
those appointed initially to tenured
or probationary positions; 3) the
use of visiting faculty members; 4)
the use of graduate assistants; 5)
the average length of the
probationary period of nontenured
faculty members who ultimately
achieve tenure; 6) the fraction of
nontenured faculty members who
ultimately achieve tenure; 7)the in-
stitutional policy on retirement;
and 8) the age distribution of the
total faculty.

B. A satisfactory long—range
plan may well imply that. alongthe
way. the proportion ofthe faculty
on tenure will at ﬁrst increase and
then. as the force of the plantakes
effect. decrease. Just as the end of
growth in the size of the faculty
leads to a gradual increase in the
ratio of those tenured. so the

Tenure Policy

and students convened to discuss
the present situation of the tenure
system. Present at the meeting

Association Barry Z. Davis. 'l'om
loriorici and faculty member Curt
Smith of the English Department.
the group noted that ilic Siroikin

to higher administrative levels for
consideration. It was said that
Sirotkin himself. author of the
original memo. when questioned
by Barry Davis. could state no ex-
planation of what “substantial new
evidence“ would be.

Talk centered on the method by
which a tenure reconsideration
would be handled. The proposal.
basically calls for the to approach
his departmental committee with
“substantial new evidence" that he
should receive tenure. lflhe rccon~
sideration results in a negativevotc

mllll. the request fails. If it is
favored by either group. it passes
on to the next level. where either
the Dean or the personnel com-
mittee must approve ofthe request.

gradual aging of the present faculty
will ultimately lead to a tendency
for the ratiotodecline. Long-range
injury to an institution may result
from rigid and busty application of
any single presumed remedy. such
as the imposition of a-ﬁxed quota.

C. It should be recognized that.
in .the short run, reducing the
proportion of a faculty on tenure
produces very little benefit by way
of ﬂexibility. It is only over a
period of several years that a
change in the proportion acquires
pertinency.

D. ' Equity. and institutional
morale. demand that all or almost
all of the burden of satisfying the
desired tenure ratio should not be
placed upon the probationary
faculty. Attractive accelerated
retirement opportunities for senior
tenured faculty present one possi-
ble alternative.

Foreclosing promotion to a
tenured position because of a
numerical quota is unacceptable.
Siricter standards forthe awarding
oftenure can be developed overthc
years. with a consequent decrease
in the‘ probability of achieving
tenure. But it is essential to dis-
tinguish a deliberate chang; ‘n
standards. retaining a positive
probability of an individual‘s
achieving tenure pursuant to well-
defincd criteria and adequate
procedures for evaluation and
review. from ti situation in which
the granting of tenure. for reasons
unrelated to the individual's
merits. is never a realistic possibili-
ty.

The low turnout might have been
due in part to the luck of advance
