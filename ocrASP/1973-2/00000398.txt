Growers, Teamsters, Local Officials Ally toSquash UFW

 

ﬁm/ orts G leisure

FRIDAY 'November 7. 1973:

An alliance of lettuce and grape
growers. Teamsters. and local law
enforcement ofﬁcials in Southern
California have been engaged in an
all-out effort during the last four
months to destroy the United Farm
Workers Union (UFW). George
Mean}. .President of the AFL-
CIO. has called it “the most vicious

Istrike-breaking. union-busting cf—
frirt that l have seen in my
lifetime." And Cesar Chavez and
the Farmworkers are once again
asking all Americans i0 join a
nationwide boycott this time
against Gallo and all other non-
tl'nion California wines. all table
grapes. all iceberg lettuce. and all
A&P and Safeway supermarkets.

Below is a report on the
background of how the current
situation developed and a discus-
sion of sonic of the questions that
have been raised about the
l-urmttork'er- I'etimstcr conflict.

History of l‘armworker‘s Struggle

guarantee of a job the following
week. In the ﬁelds. toilets were not
provided and often there was no
drinking water. Since growers
rarely took precautions to
safeguard the health of their
workers. an ' average of 800
farmworkers die each year from
poisoning by pesticides and her-
bicides and another 80.000 suffer
other effects.

In April I970. after a 5 year
strike a 3 year worldwide boycott
of grapes. and secret ballot elec-
tions. the growers finally agreed to
sign three-year contracts with the
UFW representing 85% ol the
(‘alifornia grape industry. Under
the lit-'W contracts. the minimum
wage was raised to $2.00 ati hour.

protection

corporate growers who now
dominate agriculture) attempted to
push through anti-union laws to
outlaw strikes and boycotts by
agricultural unions in order to
destroy the UFW. The growers
succeeded in passing these laws in
Ari/.ona. Kansas. and Idaho. But
in California. Florida and Oregon.
the Farmworkers organized
successful campaigns against these
laws.

The grape growers then changed
tactics. and again sought the sup«
port ol the Teamsters to beat back
the UFW. In December I972
Frank Fit/simmons. President of
the l'camsters. spoke before the
growers' organi/ation. the
American Farm Bureau Federa-
tion. and stated that he would
"welcome an alliance" with the
grotters to break the UFW which
he called "it retoluttonary move—
ment which is perprcting a fraud on
the \niericitn public." hit/sim-
tiioits liitei acknowledged that this
appearance had been tit'tsingcd by
President Nixon's lindcisccrettii't

“Snipers and goons have been

prehension of opening presents at

blue and white reveal five men. A
gratelul crowd is given the gilt oi
the Moody lilues.

“Higher and Higher" begins the

On the tock side. the Moody
Blues musically kick the (iarden's
ass. "Story In Your l1yes" and I‘m

and soulful as rock and roll can be.
What‘s tzisctntttiitg. though. is that
the Moody lilues can rock youand

“Are You Sitting Comfortably"
