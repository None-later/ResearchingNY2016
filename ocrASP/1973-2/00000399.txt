Young Gifted & Black

by far one of the most
talented students on campus
this year is brother Terry
Morgan. a bio major out of
Woodlands High. Morgan is
in every sense of the word
“young. gifted. and black."
when u rap with him u dis-
cover an awareness of self
which is hard to find and
even harder to turn loose. u
wantto learn more. and as an
artist Morgan can teach u.
writing is his thing. and if u
can get into lllikkl. Sonia.
yusclf' iman. and others...u
can get into moi‘gan. his
poems are more than words.
they are feelings, so ifu have
soul u can dcnl With Morgan.
sun-sign Virgo. check him
out!!!

“LACK ROOTS is sucking
the talents of' more and more
brothers and sisters who like
Morgan are "young. gifted.

He‘s a manchild in a ghetto

But he'll be fed humble pie
before he saves face.
He's a manchild in a blood-
bath.

But he'll have to cry before
he can laugh.
He's a nianchild
whirlpool.

But before he plays man
he‘ll play the fool.
This is the story of a black
manchilds plight.
He will have to do wrong

It's the saga of a black
manchilds flight.
