Williams With Mason

by Bob Riedinger

“The show must go on" and
Dave Mason was true to the old
show biz creed. Despite the tell-
tale symptom of impending ﬂu
which left Mason with a somewhat
raspy voice. the former Traffic
member's music permeated
smoothly enough through Chapin
Hall at Williams College.

Unfortunately. he also had to
win over an audience who abused
the intimacy the small hall provid-
ed. I was underthe impression that
booting in a packed house during
quiet accoustic sets was long gone-
but I may haveexpected rock fans
to grow up before their time.
Chapin Hall is an ideal concert
hall: can't the audience appreciate
the opportunity to get close to the
performer without giving vent to
its more obnoxious tendencies?

Somehow. Mason‘s beautiful
and delicate opener “Every
Woman." an accoustic solo from
his newly released album, managed
to surface through the restless at-
mosphere. Mason's accoustic
work was precise in his “Sad And
Deep As You" as well as with
"World In Changes.“ Jim Krieger
added electric backing to “World”

'giving this particularly mood -
. varying song a jazz feel not found
on the album version.

It was obvious. however. that the
crowd wanted to rockand roll, and
Dave Mason soon had everybody
moving once he was joined by the
rest ofthe group. Those who didn‘t
move were probably incapable of
doing so. and were content to sit
immobile and let Mason‘s stream-
ing guitar style flow through their
heads.

Dave Mason is a demanding
leader. but his group caters well to
his musical expectations. Their
timing was perfect and they seemed
to be enjoying a reallytogether per-
formance. Mason‘s own playing
improved over that of the first
show's. By now most people had
forgotten about his vocal dif-
ficultics and were lost in the excite-
ment of the music itself.

The outstanding performances
included “All Along The
Watchtower." a hypnotic “Pearly
Queen" and “Waiting On You.“
The latter two songs used the two
guitar-trade-off style which gave
the songs a heightened drive and
impact.

There were the usual songs from
Mason‘s Alone Together album
which revealed no signs ofoverplay
from the group. They also played
Stevie Winwood‘s “Baby Please."
But one ol the highlights ol the
evening was the gutsy blues
number featuring the organist on

  

a‘: - .

a. ((0)5: H

vocals. A change of pace from the
program. this drew a standing ova-
tion from the surprised crowd.

Because of Mason's desire for
the best possible sound. tuning of
guitars was not uncommon
between songs. This tended to
hinder the continuity and flow of
his performance but the resulting
quality of the songsjustifies the in-
terruptions.

As he finished his last song.
Dave Mason walked to the stage
exit. Ripping his guitar from
himself as if it was an uncomfor—
table burden. he seemcd to throw
his hands up inrelief. When hcdis—
appeared from view. the audience
began its obligatory standing ova-
tion. Dave Mason did not return;
he needed a good night's rest. not
an encore. The fans had reccitcd it
lions share of fine music,
