The latest round of White House deceit came early this week with the announce-
ment by special Nixon aide Fred Buzhardt thattwaof the Watergate tapes requested
by Judge John Sirica did not exist. in all there were 26 tapes turned over to White
House aide in charge of the tapes. John Bull. The two that did not exist. according to
Nt’izhardt, were those dealing with the conversations held between the President and
John Dean. The other missing tape concerned the conversation with John Mitchell.

Buzhardt said Wednesday that the reason the tapes were non-existent was because
at the time of the Dean conversations,the recording system malfu nctioned. Then. on
Thursday, Buzhardt changed his story. The system never malfunctioned (a comfor-
ting thought). it simply ran out of tape when Dean opened his mouth.

Who does Nixon think he is kidding? That he realized that he has made one unholy
mess ofthis nation is apparent. But that he believes that a few more outlandishlies
will save his useless credibility insults the intelligence of all Americans. How can the
single most important tape he suddenly found not to exist‘.’ H.R. Haldeman said he
heard the tape. Even Buzhardt said he heard Dean on tape. John Bull admits that for
three months he had no idea who had the tapes. or which tape anyone had.

Nixon is severely taxing the patience of this nation and that patience has about
worn out. The President's only saving grace is that he can quit before he's thrown out
of office.

Support for SASU

Today. tomorrow and Sunday this University is sponsoring the first meeting ofthe
newly created SUNY Student Assembly. Here on campus will be delegates from
every University Center, four year college. Ag. & Tech. School, and a total of eight
delegates from the community colleges. Their formidable task is to create a uniﬁed
student voice in the internal governance process ofthe SUNY system, the largest Un-
iversity in the world. Their success depends on strong student support and input
from tens of thousands of SUNY students at the grassroots level.

A great deal of confusion exists in student minds over the difference between the
Student Assembly and another state-wide organization. SASU. the Student Associa-
tion of the State University. An important difference between the two bodicsis that
SASU is not recogniled by SUNY Central Administration while the Student
Assembly is. SASU is independently student-funded while the Student Assembly is

funded by SUNY Central.

each organization's concern. While the two
hly is limited to internal University af-
eal with wider concerns.

Another difference lies in the scope of

A bill is being introduced in th

'l he meetings tomorrow are open to all stud
your new representatives in action. they need your support.

if ever lexhibit pride it i“ "M"-
ning my almost perfectly practical nature. it
is this pride that now forces me to address
suchan honorable personage as you. Mr.
President. In times of crisis. it is always the
practical man. by channelling the intentions
of the idcttlists. into it compromise. that
manages to bring satisfaction to the majori-
ty. In the dismissal of Mr. Archibald Cox as
special Watergate prosecutor I sense my op-
portunity to use this gift of pragmatic com-
promise to help holster confidence in
America.

The American public now. morethan ever.
needs to know that a truly great man has
accepted the position of special Watergate
prosecutor. This man must be able to con-
duct his investigation with speed and ef»
l'icicncy. The people must have confidence
that this man will expose the truth in these
Watergate matters and in that truth. restore
the faith of the people iii their government.
lhe man nccd display honor and integrity.
honesty and lorthrightncss: he must he a
man cspciicnccd \\ itli the law with a history
of coiiscrtatiic rcs‘pccl lot the law; a man
that has survived at least six major crises.
ha\ingthc ability to bear up rpthcr wcll un-
dcr lutiirc crises. the man must have what it
takcs. coolness is absolutely requisite.
coolnessthat inciciises \\ltcn the going gets
tougher. With sinccrc hope that you pcrceivc
the soundness of my suggestion. I do now
propose that you. Mr President. appoint
you. Mr. Nixon. to the office of special
Watergate prosecutor.

Who can question )ttut familiarity With
the pinblcms'.’ 'l'ltc most fanatic ol
Democrats \\ill admit that yoti. perhaps
more casily Illtltl any other man. can teach it
compioiiiisc With the President. With tlic
loi mcr special proscciiloi's victories in both
the United States District Court and thc
('ourt of Appeals. _\ou could legally search
through yotii tmn official l’rcsidcnltal
tlocumcnts and could listen to the Watergate
tapes Vttllltilll dealing with Judge Sirica and
a possible constitutional crisis. Certainly the

 

The. .  Faces of   p i

' A

r ‘ of the prosecutor could not be
denied; you have made it perfectly clear to
the public. that when Richard Nixon is a

public servant nothing. or nobody will
be able to restrict his powers. You‘re not only
a good man for thejob. incontext ofthe pre-
sent administration‘s demands. you‘re the
only man capable of beinga totallyindepen-
dent prosecutor.

There are problems. however. that must
be considered. With the announcement of
your self-appointment as special prosecutor
there will be the wild-eyed hysterical
network commentators who will probabalv
make vulgar innuendos to some vague con—
flict ofinterest. in order to get the President.

They will surely label you both a tyrant and a

dictator. some will demand your impeach-
mcnt while others will be sure you‘ve finally
cracked. Be brave. Mr. Nixon. such is the
abuse of a man who is earmarked to create a
structure of world peace must be ac-
customed lo.

lhc question of popular support of your
scll'»appointmcnt is hardly a question at all.
In November of last ycar thelittlc poeple an-
nounced to these l'nitcd States who it is that
is best stlllcd to rule over them. You have a
responsibility to finish tlicjoh that you were

elected to do. and finish it with the best of

your ability. and of course the more of your

tlithlltly’ you use. the better it 15.

llic last blockade in the way of you assum-

ing your role as special Watergate
prosecutor is the Congress. The confronta-
tion “till this large group of men may well
prove to be the final crisis in your political
career You may. at first, try to appeal to
them With the hope that you may fire the new
special piosccutor and seal off his desk in the
()val ()flicc. If this doesn‘t work you can
always consider rclilring Messrs. l'laldcman
atid l:t'llCltl‘tliln who \Mll 'surcl) along with
the good old White House try to tone down
the Congress. As for other alternatives. you
