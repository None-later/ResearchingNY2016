Foibles of RMN

To the Editor:

Richard Nixon said to the press on Oc-
tober 27. I973. “l have never heard or seen
such outrageous. vicious. distorted reporting
in 27 years of public life.“

In that same news conference he brought
up the case of Aaron Burr as a precedent to
support his withholding of presidential
papers. Nixon's history lesson was ex-
pressed this way:

“You remember the famous case involving
Thomas Jefferson where Chief Justice
Marshall. then sitting as a trial judge. sup-
poened a letter which Jefferson had written.
which Marshall thought or felt was
necessaryevidence in the trial of Aaron Burr.

Jefferson refused to do so. but it did not
result in a suit. What happened was. a
course. a compromise in which a summary of
the contents of the letter which was relevant
to the trial was produced by Jefferson..."

The historical truth is the letter was not
from Jefferson but to him, from General
James Wil kenson. Jefferson did not refuse to
emperate in the matter; he offered to be ex-
amined under oath. He gave the original
letter. not asummary ofthe letter to the U.A.
Attorney. who offered the letter to the court
for its use in the case.

Obviously Dick gave us a version that is
untrue. This may seem like a minorincident
but it symbolizes the disrespect Nixon has
for the people ofthis country. By tellingthis
impudent lie we can see he is not the President
but a man masquerading in the position for
his personal satisfaction and gain.

Mr. Nixon. the man who was responsible
(directly or indirectly) for hiring the cast of
the Watergate breakin is also the man who
will function above the law whenever he can
get away with it. He used illegal wiretaps to
spyon newspaper reportersiind political 0p-
ponents until the US. Supreme Court forced
him to stop. He authorized the "plumbers"
to burglerize and spy upon political op-
ponents until the American people found
out. The President withheld evidence in a
criminal case until the American people
forced him to stop. and he ignoredthat court
order until the Congress and the people ex-
pressed their outrage through talk of im-
peachment. And he secretly bombed Cam-
bodia until Congress found out and forced
him to stop.

Even after the press revealed these facts to
the American people Nixon has the gall to
question the competence of this institution.

Well Mr. Nixon. I have never seen such an
outrageous. vicious, distorted administra-
tion in the United States. If you agree With
me there is only one course of action and t hat
is to see that Nixon does not complete his
term in office.

Please do something to help express your
distrust of Richard and his friends. Write
your Congressman. write the House
Judictary Committee. join an organization
that will amplify your feelings. or contribute
money to an organi/ation that wrll express
your Viewpoint. If you can‘t do thesethings.
do somet hing. Because t he world needs your
help “now more than ever.“

Bock To Sotyricon...

To The Editor:

This article is being written in reaction to
the erotic film festival shown one weekend
ago at SUNYA. First. let us say that our
reactionto the festival itself , was positive; the
films showed cinematic quality. artistic ex-
pression. and sensitiveland humorous ap-
proaches to sex when those responses were
appropriate. Our real comment is on the
audience. I

The homosexual acts in the film were
shown: as natural courses of events and with
possibly more tenderness (especially the
female one) than most peoples‘ heterosexual
activity takes in. In the female-
subject ﬂick. the audience quietly was swept
away by the naturalness of the gestures on
the part of the women involved. There were
no sneers no relj-t'onst'i'oio defenses ofvocal
put downs (done for the benefit of the dis-
interested audience) by emotional Voyeurs.
Unfortunately. for both men and women. a
case in point was made by the polarity of
audience reaction. When a flick similar to
the one on female homosexual love and
lovemaking was shown. (involving 2 men)
the audience went up in a hot rage; it seemed
like a prize fight or a football game. The
men' were so blatant in feigned distaste: they
were afraid to sit calmly and be educated to
the comprehension of alternative sexual
modes.

The contrast between the audience reac-
tion in females as to men was unrnistakeable.

Women were able to understand and be
enlightened to the style of the gay world of
their sisters; contrary to men who yelled out
inappropriate howls as il'any sense of iden-
tificiation would be painful tothem. Socie-

ty gives the male such poor standards to live
DOWN to.. Their virility is such a fragile
thing that they spill their sperm and call it
love and mock tenderness.

Because the ﬂicks were notexploitive and
had social messages l regarded them as being
interesting approaches to their subject
matter.

The audience not only showed a tender
spot where homosexuality (male) was con-
cerned; but also with male supremacy. sex-
ism. In oneflick three peopleengaged in oral
and coital sex: though the circumstances
were unconventional (not in itself worthy of
criticism) the activities were justifiedbecause
the people doing them cared about each
others‘ sexual satisfaction; that is. no one
was abused (for the most part). But. when
the male of the group ejaculated all overthe
woman‘s face. the men cheered. The same
physical experience when engaged upon by
two men invoked all kinds of obscene com-
ments from men—derogatory to the act itself.
The question then is. how can these same
men expect lI'Olllt’Il to love them and make
love to them when the men depreciate the
women by their own conception ofthe acts
of Iovema king. Do THEY see it as abusive?
The ultimate put-down of women through
scx'? Or do they recognize it as the beautiful
and satisfying experience it can be to two
human beings. rather then mechanical.
orgasmic (but emotionally and spiritually
impotent) entities. I hope the answer the
audience gave was a false one; otherwtse.

out men—or back to Satyriconl

ISA Condemns
Student Government

Until now it had been a policy of Inter-
national Student's Association to maintain a
neutral stand concerning the Middle East
crisis. This is not because of an apathetic
feeling. but because we represent students
from both sides.

After learning of the abuses of some
students and of the student government of
this university to the Arab studentsand Arab
Association on campus. we can no longer re-
main silent.

We respect the freedom of thought. ex-
pression. and speech in all our members and
will always ﬁght to maintain these fun-
damental rights. International Students
believes in communicating on the basis of
mutual respect.

The time has come for us to raise our voice
to support the civil liberties of the members
of our organization. We will break any hand
raised against any international student on
this campus.

We heavily condemn the attitudetaken by
the student government towards Arab
students. We condemn their lack of respon-
sibility and lack of response to the violation
of the democratic rights of this country and
those of an open state university. We con-
sider this incident as an insult to our
organization and to all of our members. We
urge the student government to look upon
this incident with thescriousnessittlesertcs.

P. Y.E. Opposes Transportation Bond Act

P.Y.E. opposes the transportation bond act
for the following reasons:

-The $3.5 billion Transportation Bond Is ue
is the largest bond act ever proposed. would
double the direct debt of the state. and would
cost up to $7.3 billion to repay.

—Introduccd in a special session of the
legislature by Governor Rockefeller. the
bond act was inadequately prepared and
given too little time for the legislators to dis-
cuss.

-Although the bond allows 60% for mass
transit ($2.I billion) .40"«’ for highways (SL4
billion). when the federal matching money is
added. the balance practically reversesitself.
57% highways. 43% mass transit.

-Thc bill lacks prccrse spending mechanisms
(which the I972 Envtronmental Bond Act
had) has no long range plan for mass transit
and in fact. while all proiccts undertaken
must be part of or consistent With the
Statewide Masterplun lor Irarrsportation.
Volumes II and Ill do not wt exist.

—Two-thirds ($622 million) of the mass tran-
sit monies of the I967 Transportation Bond
Act remain unspent while all of its highway
monies ltavc been spent. If the I973 TBA is
passed. estimates are that it will take IZ-IS
years to spend the mass transit monies and
only 3-5 years to spend the highway monies.
The present administration has had a record
of slow spending on mass transit. which
means that the monies are constantly being
eaten up by inflation. while highways are
built almost immediately.

-No other bond act has ever allowed Torin-
direct subsidiztng of transit operations.
Lumping current operating expenses and
capital expenditures under one bond act is a
questionablepractice.

-’l'he Department of Transportation
suggests that the fares throughout the state

'will rise from 350: if the bond is not passed.

This is not necessarily so. Surplus moneyex-
ists in this year‘s budget. between $52 million
and Soilflmillion. depending whether you
believe (iover'niii‘ Rockefeller or Comp-
troller lctitt. respectively.

million per year is needed to subsidi/eiiansit
fares statewide at 35c. ()t her methods of sav-
ingthe fart-exist. (Rememberthai |‘)7-’l rsan
election year for the Governor and the
legislators and you can be sure that they wrll
come up with a plan to save the fare.)
Supportors of the bond argue that mass
transit money is desperately needed. l'hat
premise cannot be disagreed upon. but the
method of raising masstransit money can in-
deed be argued. l'he answer does not lie in
heavily indebting ourselves by passinga $3.5
billion bond which. in reality is weighted
towards highways. just to gain a stop—gap
solution to a problem which needsa thought-
ful. innovative. realistic. long-range solu-
tion. Therefore. P.Y.E. urges you to vote no
to Proposition One. but at the same time to
write (iovernor Rockefeller. Transportation
Commissioner Schuler. your State Senator.
and Assemblyman. urging them to come up
with a better plan for masstransit. indepen-
dent of any highway plan.
