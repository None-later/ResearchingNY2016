In RlT. the Danes findavery
capable varsity team. They
stand 3-3-l and are coming off
a 43-0 laugher against Siena.

Three years ago the Danes
got their first footballwinevcr
over RIT, and since then
they've alternately whipped
each other. Last year Albany
won 28-6. but in ‘7l. they
traveled to Rochester and lost
4I-2l. lntliatgame. RIT rack-
ed up Albany’s offensive star
Bernie Boggs.

RI'I' offers the best pair of
running backs in the Danes
schedule arid the college
division's leading return man.

yards and pose an inside alid
otltside threat. Alan l.enl/.
who dotlbles at split end. is
averaging 34.7 alid IS yards
respectively on kickoff arid

Operating out of a l’chr I.
Rll relies on their running
game. I’liey like to use
Romano on the (IIYL‘ lllid
Iluliiplirey on the sweep and
option pitch. Defensivcly.
they‘re solid and led by middle
guard l’aul lsbell. who's broken
all the RI | tackling records.

hard and lost. The game
tomorrow should be a test of
how well we can bounce back.“
To beat RIT. the Danes will
have to contain Humphrey and
keep the ball away from Lentz.
RIT is a very emotional team,
and they‘ll be sky high Satur-
day to avenge last year‘s loss.
Ford sees RIT as the crucial
game of the season as neither
l’lattsburgli or Rl’l. the l)ane‘s
last two opponents. have won
a game.
It‘s \ery hard to ciaItIate the

Pro Football Predictions 

by the Blond Bombshell

After an average 7-6 week
and being 56-35 for the season
we will try to have a big week.

BUFFALO over NEW
ORLEANSby 6‘. OJ. is back
and New Orleans' had
their super game last week.
They will not stop himlikethcy
stopped Larry Brown.

GREEN B A Y 0 ve r
CHICAGO by 6. Devine and
Packer fans wonder where the
offense went. It's a must game
for Green Bay and Chicago
can‘t be counted on fortwo ina
row.

DALLAS over BENGALS
by 3. Two good teams who are
as inconsistent as they are
good. This time its Dallas‘turn
to win it.

CLEVELAND over
MINNESOTA by 3. Nobody is
going I7-O so why not end the
streak this week. Minriesola
might just let down.

DENVER over ST. LOUIS

 

 

A KISS ON HIM.

 

 

 

 

 

 

ONCE BENEATH A CAMPUS TREE,
A KNIGHT DID COURT WITH LITTLE
SUCCESS A COMELY MAID KNOWN
BY ONE AND ALL TO BE A CULTIST.

AND THE KNIGHT DID APPROACH THE
MAIDEN FULL OF HOPE THAT SHE

WOULD FALL FOR THE OLD PRINCE‘
IN-THE-FROG ROUTINE AND PLANT

MED YOU'RE

by 3. Denver might be the most
improved team in the league.
Floyd Little will break a big
one.

H O U S T O N o v e r
BALTIMORE BY 3. Houston
is going to win one so why not
this week. The Colt fans
deserve better,

K.C. over SAN DIEGO by 4.

KC. might not have a great
offense but there is no way San
Diego seorcs many points
against that defense.

l,.A. over ATLANTA by 3.
[Wu Iiot quarterbacks and two
good delerises bill I.,A. isangry

this garlic for granted.

UNDAJhTED BY REBUKE, HE DID

TO DISCOVER THE EXACT CULT TO
WHICH THE MAID WAS COMMITTED

OAKLAND over GIANTS
by 9. The Giants season has

been pitiful so w
the horrors. If .Ii

made to look like a super star
why not Ken Stabler.

MIAMI over

JETS by 2. Yes it will be closer
than you might
Woodall is back at quarter—
back. Miami did not impress

last weekend.

49‘ERS over DETROIT by

will be playing at Williams
College. Maybe things will
change again. All that can be
said right now though is that
the four former ball players are
very disappointed. especially
Mr. Eisenman, on the sudden
turn of events which led to their
resignation. And when any
team loses four proven ball
players. no matter what the
sport. the holes they leave may
just be too big to fill. For the

player's sake, for the school‘s
sake. and especially for the
fan‘s sake. let‘s hope that any
differences will be quickly
resolved. For SUNYA is a
basketball school and it gets
cold enough up here even
knowing that Albany State
does have the best basketball
team in the SUNYAC. if not
the entire state!!

We'll have more on this story
next week.
