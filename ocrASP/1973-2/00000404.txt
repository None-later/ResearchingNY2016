When the Albany State

and their opponents. An

        

  

ECAC bid was on the line and

Basketball Team In Turmoil
Eisenman, Huche. Terry & Hoffman Quit

by Harvey Kojan and Doug
Lewanda

Four members of the Albany
State Varsity Basketball Team.
Jim Eisenman. Felton Hyche.
Dennis Terry. and Jerry Hoff-
man. have reportedly quit due
to internal troubles. The dis-
pute centered around Coach
Richard ‘Doc' Sauch and his
handling of four allegedly
recruited freshman from the
Capital District Area. After
learning of the problem, the
ASP contacted Eiscnman, a
junior. who starred last season
on the junior varsity basketball
team.

What Eisenman told us was
essentially this: After the first
practice ofthc year back on Oc-
tober l5. Coach Sauers in—
formed the four players that he
was going to “live and die" with
the freshmen. And upon asking
Sauers what his status was with
the team. the Coach told Jim
that his performance would
make no difference as far as his
position with the team was con-
cerned: he would be relegated
to the bench. When Eiseninan
asked the coach frankly
whether it would matter if he
“proved beyond the shadow of
a doubt that I‘m as good or
better thitn them" (the recruited

freshman). Saucrs simply

replied. “No.”

What perhaps is the most
ironic development in this
rapidly building dilemma is the
fact that in previous years.
there was one principle that
Doc never broke. He would
not use a player if he did not
have any ‘experience‘. That's
why Eiscnman played with the
Pups last season. For accor-
dingtothecoach.Jim beingthe
sixth man onthe Arkansas Un-
iversity freshmen team. and
playing against such name
schools as Louisiana State.
Jacksonville. and Memphis.
schools which play in front of
ten thousand people or more in
places like the Mid-South
Coliswm. or Freedom Hall to
nllml: a few. was not enough.
Jim consented and spent last
year with Coach Bob Lewis and
the J.V.. building up a poten~
tially sound team. What is sur-
prising. therefore. is the fact
that it appears that up to now.
Satiers has changed his ways of
running the ball club. and will
let ball players with no college
experience he on the roster.

This is not to say that these
four freshman lack talent in any
way—far front it. in fact. accor-
ding to liiseiiman. these players
“are the finest to come otit of"

 

be one of the most bizzare
games that the booters have
played as they defeated Union,
7-4.

The soccer team this year has

developed a solid defensive

lL’lll‘lliI n

the Capital District Area in
quite some time“ and “they
have some really great poten—
liftl. And coming from the
local high schools". he added.
“these kids would really be get~
ting a lot of well deserved
coverage and exposure." But
what bothers the four cit-Great
Danes at this very moment is—
why should it cost them their
jobs?!

As far as the remaining
players on the team are con-
cerned. the ASP has learned
that after—school practigc itself
has not begun on the brightest
of notes. Currently.tlierc is no
true cohesion among all the
players. little “clicks” have
formed. guys won‘t talk to one
another. and it seems that for
the present moment. a trip to
the gym forAlbany Great Dane
basketball practice is nothing
more than a requirement. a
chore. a task. it job for those
still on the roster. Even the
Coach himself seems to be a let-
tle bit edgy these days. Perhaps
he might be rc-evaluating his
decisions and maybe second
guessing himself (an art which
keeps as sports writers
employcd).

The year is still young.

Harriers Win
Final Meet

by Kenneth Ardino

While both the football team
and soccer team are much im~
proved this year most people are
taking the cross-country team
for granted. Every year they
have a good team so what'sthe
big deal. The big deal is that
this may be the ﬁnest team in
history. Last Tuesday they
demolished Union to wrap up
their dual meet record at fl-3
tying the l966 team for most
wins in a season.

The demolition of Union(l7—
43)is even more impressive
when you realize that runner
Nick DeMiirco is still injured
and both Bill Sorel and Herb
Hrtssrin was left home due to
tests. The first three Albany
runners bekL' the course record
led by Jim Shrader who won
the race. Vinnie Reda with his
highest finish all yertr rind Carlo
(‘herubino followed Slirudcr
in. Freshman Chris Burns was
fourth. Curt Woodcock. John
Kock. , Jim Stacey iittd Ron
Dunn all placed in the topten.

 

The performance on a course
which coach Munsey called
“extremely difficult" was even
more remarkable as it was the
first time Albany has ever run
on the course.

With the regular season now
over Albany now has a duel
record under Munsey of l08-
23. The Danes travel tothe Up—
state Championships this
weekend. Munsey is quite con-
fident that the Danes can repeat
as winners. He feels that the
team is peaking right now
which is just as he hoped for.
With Rcdti and Shrader on top
form, Albany will be tough to
beat.

liliis Monday the cross-
wuntrylcnm will petition the
Atlieletic Advisory lloard logo
to the nationals. Hopefully

their petition will be accepted
as it is possible for Albitny to
get its best finish yet.
