Don Ross. head ofthe New York
Public Interest Research Group
spoke to SUNYA students about
the organization last Thursday
night. His speech. attended by
about 50 people. included various
points of a political reform
package that NYPIRG would like
to see put into effectconceming the
New York State government.

The first point of the package
concerns the passing of a “freedom
of information“ act. Ross believes
that the first essential step in open-
ing the established political system
must be to make the information
accessible to the people. This
means that all political meetings
and records should be open to
public scrutiny.

Up to now. the state legislators
Itavc been shielded in a cocoon of
secrecy. NYPIRG wants to give
otir assemblymen visibilitvlforcc
them to make a stand on current
issues. defend their voting records.
and reveal their campaign expen-
ditures. The organization believes
that a cornmision should be set up
to mail information packets to
every voter concerning the can-
didates and the issues in the next
election. In the meantime. though.
until such a commissionis formed.
NYPIRG hopes to enlist ap-
proximately seventy-five students
to compile a pamphlet containing
an in-depth proﬁle on every state
legislator. In this way. more infor—
mation than ever before available
in one place could be easily ob-
tained.

The next step. after informing
the public so that it can vote in~
telligently, concerns giving the
average person the opportunity to

Ross Calls For Reform.
in NY. State Government ‘

also run for office. At present. the
middle-class working man cannot
afford the campaign costs in-
volved. It has been reported that it
costs $250,000 to wage an effective
campaign for an assembly seat
from a downstate area. It has been
suggested in previous years that
campaign expenditures be limited.
NYPIRG feels that a better reform
measure would be to make man—
datory absolute public financing of
all campaigns. forno open political
process can exist as long as there
are private campaign con-
tributions.

Another area of reform in this
package involves the institution of
strict registration requirements for
all lobbies in the state legislature.
Requirements must be toughened
in order to record Iiccuraqtc infor-
mation. such as their financial ex-
pcttdittires. In addition. a com—
mittee must be set up to enforce
such registration requirement laws.

Only an organization such as
I’IRG is capable of carrying out
such art enormous project because
it is the only one with ties to univer-
sity campuses and a full-time staff.
So far. eiglttccn PIRG's have been
established in various states. NYI’~
IRG. though. is the first one to
tackle such controversial issues im-
mediately after its formatioit.

Ross emphasizes that PIRG
is not a pipcdream-publicinvolve—
ment docs lead to reform. Right
now. Ross plans to establish l-and
2-person offices throughout the
state. to be aided by student interns
and professors on sabbatical. Job
openings are available in the
summer. while volunteers are now
being recruited for possible credit
durirtg the school year. A possible

idea for obtaining credit would he
the formation ofa political science
honors seminar restricted to six
students. whose goal would be to
try to gctti picccoflegislature pass-
ed in the assembly. Each student
would learn the ins and outs of a
particular bill. work under the
guidance of an attorney. and then
go front door to door of
assemblymen's offices trying to get
the bill passed.

A petition drive to get NYPIRG
into SUNYA is currently taking
place in the Campus Ccntcrand in
quad Ilagrooms. If it does get in. a
voluntary $2 fee will be listed on
each student‘s semester bill. This
cantpus would provide NYPIRG
with a strong base in the state
capital.

Anyone interested tit \oluntecr-
ing their services or learning ntore
information about this organira»
lion should drop by SUNYA
NYPIRG office located in the
basement of Seneca Hall on Indian
Quad,

NYPIRG is a student—directed
task force aimed at investigating
broad unrepresented common in-
terests and establishing reforms
when necessary. It has four main
areas of interest: consumerism. en-
vironmental protection.
governmental responsibility and
tax reform on both the state and
local levels. Eight or nine uniyer-
sitics are already members of the
organization at present in New
York State. SUNYA students are
petitioning for it to be admitted to
this campus.

The Pre-Bé'gis‘ts'dtirm

Now that we‘ve had time to

Expansion 0f Dorms

by JoAnne S. Andrews

Plans fordonnitoryextension to
meet the expected rise In enroll-
ment by the end ofthisdecade have
been all but scrapped for con-
sideration. This. according to Mr.
Gary Petre. is the policy as cs-
tablislied by Ernest Boyer.
Chancellor of the SUNY system.
Petre. Director of Residences.
responded to questions put to him
last week in the course of dis-
cussions about the severe over-
crowding that this campus faced at
the otttsct of the school year.

I’etre explained that the uptown
and downtown dorms are
equipped to house 5.379 rcsidertt
students. l'hc resident enrollment
at this llrtricrsityrn September was
5.5lll. the cause of tire housing
crisis. Ihis has since been
eliminated asrnore than that excess
has left school for It vtirtcty of
reasons.

lhis year total full time
equivalent enrollment in this un-
iversity is approximately 14.000 -
this includes graduate and part
time students as well as full time
students. I’ctrc reportsthat bytltc
year Witt) students enrollment iscs~
tintatcd to rise to H.055.

Asked if arty CKPIIITSIUIIS Will be
made wttli lltc dor‘rrtrtories. to
.rllow for this future increase. Mr.
l’ctrc says that there Is absolutely

no possibility of expansion.
Chancellor Ernest Boyer reports
that there are to be no more hous-
ing expansions on any university.
and no exceptions will be made.

Mr. Petre seems to feel that the
large increase of students will be
mainly graduate and part time
students. and for the most part will
be commuters. There are also more
students doing degree work. and
they too will be primarily com-
muters. Mr. Petre believcsthatthis
university is pretty well complete.
except for perhaps. a possibility of
expansion of the Academic
Podium.

Mr. Petre went on to discuss
rcgioitalism. where the trend of
students attending colleges is
becoming more ofstudcntsgoingto
school irt tltcir Immediate living
area. I here Isricontinuing increase
of more commuting students and
less students living on campus.

It scents that SUNY Albany is
well settled. and any housing
problems that may occur in the
future will not be so great that
housing arrangements can‘t be
made without any physical dor—
mitory expansion. Even if a grail
titt'hcrowd .tg did occur. not too
much could be done about It. ac-
cording to lioyer‘s policy. 'Ihus.
