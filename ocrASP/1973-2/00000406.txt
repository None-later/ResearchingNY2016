With a small but enthusiastic group of from 125 to
ISO students marching under intermittently rainy and
threatening skies. Thursday‘s “Impeach Nixon"

march on the state capital was a relative success.

The marchers gathered on the baseball ﬁeld of the
downtown campus on the corner of Washington and
Partridge and waited for the word to go. The crowd,
composed of students from SUNYA and some from
Albany High School. ﬁnally got underway sometime
around eleven o'clock. shortly after Mike Parenti. the

group coordinator. arrived.

The group. carrying signs calling for impeachment.
followed an American flag carried in the front of the

procession down the sidewalk to the capitol.

In keeping with SUNYA Professor Mike Parenti‘s
idea of “going to the people". the line followed a
somewhat circuitous route to the eastern steps of the
capitol building. With a police escourt oftwo motor-
cycles and several patrol cars. the demonstrators
marched down Washington Avenue to Quail Street.

Senate Majority Leader Warren
M. Anderson Friday. made public
a preliminary report from Senator
Ronald B. Stafford. chairman of
the Senate Committee on Higher
Education. which asserts that ex-
isting programs of college strident
aid had become so "fragmented"
that the system “has lost touch with
the needs of the students it is iri—
tcndcd to serve."

The comprehensive report.
\vhicli'was endorsed by the two
Republican lawmakers. calls f'o for
the establishment of ii Higher
Education Services Corporation to
consolidate the administration of
all existing systems of student
financial assistance. The corpora-
tiori would hcable to eliriiinateine-

costs. a multiplicity ofapplicrititrris
and delays in aid payriients. which

students are forced to seek illgh~

of college.

Senator Anderson said that lie
would refer tlicd report to the
Select Committee on Higher
Iiducation for ll}. evaluation and
approval. and tr the Senate
Republican Conference fr r crin-

system.

The report noted that New York
State directly supports l6 separate
aid programs. involving
schohrships. grants or loans. In
addition to these. other sources
support more more than 70
separate aid programs.

“Assuming that students are

which under the present system is
virtually impossible. the
procedures for qualiﬁcations may
require the completion of as many
as If) or more applications."
\ndc rson and Stafford said.

“ l'lie increasing number of corr-
strtucnt complaints and requests
for assistance received by all
legislators attests to thc inade—
quacics in the quality of service
provided by the present system.

“Delays in receiving aid pose
tremendous liquidity problems for
sortie students. 'l'lie questionable
status of emancipation for married
urrdergradrratcs is often patently
unfair. Interpretations of what
constitutes "rcsidcncy" vary wide-
ly. l'he dclatrlt rate on student
loans has risen from 2 percent in
i907 t ii an estimated ratcof'fiA per-
cent this year.

“All of these intolerable realities
are clear evidenced that we are not
living up to otrr State‘s commit-
ment to provide adequate
assistance for any student with the
ability and desire to pursue a
higher education.“

WAHINGTON (AP) Acting Atty.
Gen. Robert H. Bork testified-
Monday that r special; Watergate
prosecutor Leon anorski has
White House assurances he can go
to court for any evidence. including
presidential tapes, if President Nix-
on refuses to hand it over. “He‘s
free to go to_ court.“ Bork said.

Bork told a House Judiciary
subcommittee he believes Asst.
Atty. Gen. Henry E. Peterson has
already drawn up a demand for
White House documents not
previously producedl but said he
doesn‘t know what they are.

Bork also said he believes
.Iaworski will seek new Watergate
indictments in what Bork hopes
will be a month or less.

Bork said Jaworski was assured
of the freedom to go to court for
airy evidence during a meeting with
White House chief of staff Alex-
ander M. Haig Jr.. and White
House lawyers H. Fred Buzhardt
and Leonard Garment.

"Everybody agreed to it." Bork
testified. “That meansto me.thatif
he did it. he would not be fired.“

Ilut Bork said he personally had
not discussed with Nixon the
assurance that Jaworski coud go to
court for evidence.

In other Watergate-related
developments Monday:

-l)onald H. Segretti. a political
sabotcur financed with Nixon cam-
paigri funds. was sentenced in
federal court to serve six monthsin

Segretti has testiﬁed 'he was
recruited for his campaign
sabotage by former presidential
aide Dwight L. Champin. He
pleaded guilty last month to three
federal misdemeanor. counts ar-
rising from violation of federal
laws in the 1972 Florida
Democratic presidential primary.

-At Key Biscayne. the Presi-
dent conferred with his Watergate:
lawyers and the Florida White
House repeated Nixon's intention
to see the Watergate mattercleared
up. There were indications Nixon
and his aides were seeking to' settle
on ways to take the offensive
against the continuing tide of
Watergate developments.

_ Sen. Peter H.
Dominick. R-Colo.. publicly
broke with Nixon and advised
Republicans to proclaim in-
dependence from the White House.
Dominick. a long-time Nixon
loyalist. said in a DenVer speech
that the President should disclose
immediately all information onthe
Watergate investigations. The na-
tion faces a grave crisis of con-
fidence in Nixon‘s ability to lead.
he said.

—Watergate prosecutors disclos-
ed that ousted White House
counsel John W. Dean Ill told
them last week that he shredded
two notebooks taken from
Watergate conspirator E. Howard
l-Iunt's safe. The government has
contended for nearly a year that all
evidence in the safe had been turn-
ed over to the FBI.
