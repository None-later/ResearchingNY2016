Higher Education:
Who Should Pay ?

by Chip Berlet

Who should foot the bill for
higher education? A recent report
of the Committee for Economic
Development (CED) suggested
students should pay. setting off a
storm of controversy in
Washington. Charges. threats.
counter-charges and prophesies of
doom ﬁlled the capital air. Press
releases blanketed education
writers‘ desks.

When the rhetorical dust settled
the higher education establishment
found itself d ivided into twoarmed
camps. Fundamental
philosophical differences aligned
the free market/private enterprise
advocates against the societal
benefit/universal education sup-
porters. Not surprisingly. the
former includes business leaders.
private colleges and universities
and the Nixon administration
while the latter consists of labor
leaders. public colleges arid univer-
sities, some members of Congress.
and many student groups.

The Free Market thesis can be
synthesized in three salient points.

l)A college degree is sovaluable
iit financial terms due to increased
earnirtg power. that the private in-
dividual should be willing to
spend the money or go intodcbt
as a long-term investment which
would eventually be repaid
through higher net salaries after
graduation.

2 lRaisiiig public tnitiort to ritore
closely rcliect the actual coslsol an
education would narrow the gap
between priyate and public turtion
charges. thus making the two
systems more competitive aitd
thereby strengthening the many
linancially -shak’y prriate iri-
stiltittoits.

3i holding the student directly
would create a market economy
and a system ot supply and dernartd
whereby the student. as a con-
siirner. would detiiic the direction
of higher ed ticatioir throtigli ltis or
lter choice ol school and area ol
study.

Societal Beneﬁts

llic Societal llenclit proponents
counter these points saying:

it A college education
\altiable to society as a whole iii
terms ol the increased abiliton thc
iridiyidtial to solve the pr‘pblcms ol
the society. liirthcr. rccciit sliid ics
indicate that wlirlc iict starting
salaries may be ltighcr ltIt degrcc<
holders. gross lilctiiiic earnings
may he tongth the same doc to

s

rtiore years iii the job ruaiket aird
better seniority tor those \sliostail
nork attei secondary school.

I) lhe principle behind public
colleges and universities is to bring
a college education to all member s
ot society not inst the tiaditiotial
groups who cotild alloid private
colleges |hisdcinociiittcprinciple
should not be abandoned to sliote
up the sagging hulvtark ol private
institutions.

it While targeting rnoie aid
directly to students is a desirable
goal. the total abandonment of in~
stittitioital grants would destroy
the traditional systeitt oi higher
education as we know it and restrlt
in gloi ilicd ltadc schools strivrngto
increase earning power rather than
ediicaiioit individuals.

llie battle lines may lie drawn
around these two competing
philosophies btit criticism ol the
tnrtioiHlouhlrng plans “1c.ny
into piactialcorisidcralionsas well.

lhe (ll) plan suggests rinsing
tuition to cover hall ilie instruc-
iional costs ot education. it

recommendation which would at
least double tuition at public
schools while leaving private
tuitions virtually unchanged. Us-
ing costs of the 1969-70 academic
year as a base. the plan wouki raise
the average semester tuition‘at a
state university from $4|3 to $996
and at a state college from $309 to
$803.

The CED panel stressed tuition
hikes should be coupled with in-
creased student financial aid, with
flat grants going to lower income
groups and loans to middle income
families.

The CED plan is predicated one
shift to direct student aid rather
than institutional support. They
argue that this system is more
equitable because only those in
financial need would receive
government funds. The theory is
the same amount of money ends
tip in the college coffers. only the
route is different.

But Allan Ostar. Executive
Directorof the American Associa-
tion of State Colleges and Univer-
sities disagrees. He suggests. “The
writers of this report don‘t know
how legislators work. Experience
with federal student aid programs
proves that they are grossly under-
financed. and dependent on the
shiliting political priorities of
bureaucrats. Congressional Com-

mittees. and private ibenken.“

Loyton Olson. Executive Direc-
tor of the National Sttudent. Lab-J
by. echoes thisanalysis: “Promise:
of coupling tuition increases with
grants for low income students

. have been around for years. The
problem is that itnevcrquite works
out thatway. Grants never keep up
with the rise in tuition even for low-
income families. much less formid-
dle income families."

Critics ofthe CED plan fear the
legislators. especially on the state
level. might adopt only the tuition
boosting aspects of the probposal
and ignore the provisions for in-
creased student aid. They feel any
increased revenue from tuition in-
creases would immediately be
eaten up by cutbacks in ﬁnancial
support by state legislatures and
Congress. and by increases in
faculty salaries to meet inﬂation.

Heavy Debt

Ominously. Sterling McMurrin.
Dean of thegraduate school ofthe
University of Utah and CED pro-
ject director disagreed with his
committees‘ report on this and
other issues regarding tuition
hikes. “People and governments
just won‘t give enough money it if
they think the schools are already
getting enough through the
students.” said McMurrin. Healso
warned of the heavy debt burden
vthich would be accumulated by
middle-income students under the
CED plan.

For instance. under the CED
proposala student with a family in-
come of $l0.000 would receive a

$348 yearly grant. But Chancellor
Calvin Lee of the University of
Maryland; Baltimore County,
observes the CED tuition increase
would raise costs to the average of
$540 at public four year in-
stitutions. This leaves a gap of at
least Sl92. Further. Lee warned,
“add to this inﬂationary trend and
it adds up to a $740 increaseovera
5-year period.“ These figures are
on top oftheaverage yearly tuition
rate of $361 at public four year in-
stitutions. 'lt'sanelaborate way to
charge the middle class $400 a
year.“ said Lee. '

Under the CED proposal. the
cut—offlevel for government grants
is incomes over Sl2,000 per year.
Those with incomes above that
level would have to cover the in-
crease with cash on hand or
borrowed funds. For the govern-
ment grant to equal the proposed
tuition charges. the family income
has to be lea than $6500 per year.
This results in a situation where
lower-income students might be
able to afford college while middle-
income students could not.

This Would mean that middle-
class students, “would have to go
deeply into debt...in order to ob-
tain a college education.” claims
Allan Ostar.

“We just don‘t have confidence
in loans.“ said Ostar. Larry
Friendman. President of the
National Student Association.

\‘ ‘\‘ £3113“
stasis

. .il,
gl‘lllli

yljttlllily,’ “it

agreed, saying lower‘income and
minority students have always had
diffictu securing loans because
banks consider them bad
risks."Even with grants and loans.
many lower income students still
could not afford to pay the higher
tuitions proposed by CED and
Carnegie Commission." Friend-
man said. The student leader
warned that students would not be
willing to “mortgage their souls” to
get an education.
The Game Phn

All of the tuition boosting
recommendations. fit neatly into
President Nixoh‘s "’game plan" for
higher education funding which is
based on funding students directly
through Basic Opportunity Grants
and several loan programs while
curtailing institutional aid.

Last yearyCongress was unwill-
ing to accept Nixon's reordering'of
priorities in post-secondaryschool
finance and rejected his proposals.
When Congress snubbed his plans
he signed the billauthorizing funds
for higher education. buionly after
issuing a strong protest. This year
he as already threatened to veto the
measure unless Congress agrees to
his proposals.

The key to the struggle is the
ability of Congress to withstand
the pressure from the White
House. If Congress relents. state
legislatures will follow in swift
succession. Once fundingofhigher
education is shifted exclusively to
the administration's philosophy. it
seems I inevitable that higher
tuitions will follow.
