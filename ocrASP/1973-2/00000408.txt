. l ‘We Now Have The Means

The ﬁnancing of higher education will be a major concern of the newly-instituted
Student Assembly throughout the ensuing months. Current costs and the threat of
increased tuition have forced the issue to top priority.

The recommendations of the Keppel and Carnegie Commisions represent a step
backwards . in the trent toward facilitating the accessibility of higher education. it
is now the job of the students, through organizational frameworks such as the Stu-
dent Assembly and SASU. to provide effective opposition to those who limit the
right to education for all, poor and middle-income alike. As newly-elected Student
Assembly Chairperson Brian Petraitis has stated, the recommendations for revam-
ping financial aids programs serve to “play the poor off against the middle class.“
rather than to take signiﬁcant strides towards lessening everyone‘s burden.

The time has come for the student voice to be heard and we now havethe means to
do it. Through the statewide Student Assembly union. the students now have a
strong voice in decisions that affect them directly. Through SAS U. Inc. the arm of
the Student Assembly independent of direct Central Administration regulation, the
students of the state now have the power to take their case to court. if need be. No
longer will student input be ignored. They‘re going to have to listen.

An 0versight?

The Chancellor's office was most gracious this weekend in footing the bill for the
first Student Assembly conference held here at SUNYA. Room and board was
provided for delegates from all participating schools. There was. however. a gross
“oversight” on the part of the Chancellor‘s office: no provision whatsoever was
made to accommodate the press.

While we realize that the Chancellor‘s office had to draw the line somewhere. it
strikes us that ifthe Central Administration really supported the concept ofthe Stu-
dent Assembly some provision for publicity would have been made. Student media
personnel attending the conference were forced to fend for themselves if they even
managed to make it to Albany at all. There was a noticeable lack of outside media
coverage at the weekend conference as well.

it would seem that if the Central Administration took the idea of student input
seriously. it would have at least considered student press coverage of the Student
Assembly conference vrtaf.

Danish Delights

It‘s not often that we can tip our hats for something happening here at Albany but
our applause must go out to the Danes' fall sports teams. who are in the process of
comnleting the most successful season ever after Saturday‘s clean sweep.

The soccer team coached by Bob Schiefflin should be quite proud of their perfor-
mance this year bouncing from a single victory season last year to a win at last
weekend‘s University Center Soccer Tournament. They now have a chance at an
NCAA Tourney bid.

We send our hardiestcongratulations to Coach Bob Ford and the football team for
making their first year of varsity football a big success.

To Coach Bob Munsey and the cross-country team we wish continued success in
the national championships and in the inter Collegiate Association of American
Amateur Athletics(|C4.A‘) championships already having taken the State University
Championship and the Upstate title.

The athletics deserve our support for their fine efforts and outstanding achieve-

merit.

President John l". Kennedy was a great

him as a fine president. it man who. lll‘K'VCflll.
inspired trust and confidence in the
American people.

The nation was behind him as he
took the blame fora Bay of Pigs fiasco that
wasn‘t entirely his fault. and stood behind
him as he led our country though the thirteen
dark and crucial day til the Cuban Missile
Crisis. The whole world breathed a huge
sigh of relief when otir president stood
eyeball to eycbell with Nikita Khrushchev.
and the Russian blinked. America waslucky
to have .lohnKeiinedy during these crucial

Today's college students were quite young
when President Kennedy was in office. but

This is not a letter forcontributions. thisis
a letter of concern.

Consider the problems facing our state
and our nation. The ineffective manner in
which our present leaders answer this urgen-
cy. '

It is my belief after speaking to many New
Yorkers. that the state government does not
serve the needs of the people.

At a time when polls are showing public
confidence in politics and politicians at anall
time low. we need a man who not only is a
proveti administrator but a man that the
people can trust.

It is imperative that the public recognize
rfre need for an innovative, concerned.
trustworthy piibfic servant with astute ad—
ministratch ability. I believe I have found
such it man in Former Senator Charles E.

After personal interview with Senator

state government that is responsive to the
