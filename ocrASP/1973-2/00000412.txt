‘ Rooters? Hopes Rise

by Andrew Curtis

The Albany State soccer team.

soccer. won the State University
Center Championships in a hard-
fottght overtime final this past
weekend. The win thereby puts
Albany in a strong position for a
post-season tournament bid.

The Danes opened the tourna-
ment against Buffalo. Buffalo
scored I'irst.afieronly fourminutes
of play. but as things turned out.
tltat was their only score of the
game. Midway in the half. .losc
Ruano tied the game. assisted by
Edgar Martiner. Early in the se-
cotid half Albany was able to take
the lead \then John Rolando eon-
\erted a penalty kick. Ten rniritites
later. the Danes scored an impor-
tant insurance goal. when a direct
kick by Leroy Aldridge fotind its

cold and blustery Saturday after-

their first shutout this season. the
Danes tipped their record to 5-2
and. more significantly. evened the
record against varsity competition
to two wins and two losses. Just as
pleasing to the teiim and the
coaching staff was the fact that
they were victorious on the road. a
location that has brought the foot-
ball learn little success since the ad-
vent ol the sport three years ago.
Although allwas satisfyingasfar
as the actioti on the field was con~
ccrncd (from the IXitics' point of
view). thch were other things
which did not make lot an ideal
day. Not only was it a bit chilly

The tie would have to bedecided

The second half proved far
different from the first. as Albany
continued to move the ball.and the
defense all but completely stopped
any offensive moves by the Tigers.
With the game proceeding in that
fashion (RI. I. playing the “l-Z-J-

that the Danes would break the
game open with another score or
two. which is exactly what happen—
ed. In the middle of the third

The Danes now hope for an NCAA

SUNY league champs. More
significantly. the victory gave the
Danes their first possible shot at 21
NCAA bid. and almost a certain
berth in the ECAC post-season
play.

The Danes have come along way
from last year‘s 1-1 H season.
Finishing 8-4-1, and winning 7 out
of their last 9. with the two losses
coming in close valiant battles with
Onconta and Brockport. the Danes
have certainly become a for-
midable opponent.

"I feel that the ASP owes my

response of varsity basketball
coach Richard “Doc” Saucrs

after the revelations in Friday‘s

ASP.

In Friday‘s paper the ASI’
had learned that four players
had quit the basketball team
and it appeared that they were
trot given a fair chance to prove
themselves. ()therproblcmson

revealed.

about their status for the

them that lie was going to go

Junior varsity,

the ASP asked the coactr
whether the players who quit
deserved a chance to prng
themselves. Saucrs said that
"lie has seen l-Iofftnan. Ilyclie.

two years and knew what they
cart do and decided that what
the other players had in talent
was better. Sauers emphasi/ed
“lie would be the dumbestguy
III the world to try and help his

“the players in question had
really proved nothing. I wish I
could have given them a chance
but the guards last y -ar arid at
the present tinte were better.“

Another key poirit irt
l'riday‘s aritcle was talk of dis—

Evidence Senate Splits on

Sirotkin’s Memo

by David Inner

Amid rumors of impending i'n-

criminating evidence against Vice

President for Academic Affairs
Philip Sirotkin. the University
Senate convened/Moridayin a pen-
sive atmosphere.

The agenda for the session in-
cluded consideration of several
Senate hills dealing with tlie‘issue
of promotions and continuing ap-
pointments at the lfniiersity.
Debate in the Senate on the tenure
issue had been quite mterisne dur—
trig the past few weeks and the
promise of even more actiiedehatc
elicited little enthusiasm; from the
Senators.

Following the regular business
of the Senate, ltigliliglited by Louis
I liciie/et '5 President‘s Report in
\\IltL’ll he expressed his desire to
ticier again give the report to the
Senate. the relatiiely itiore impor-
taiit business facing the body got
underway.

to his report. Rene/ct referred to
the recent informal budget
hearings that were held duritig the
month of October. He relayed his
requests to SUNY ('entral for what
he termed “modest improvements"
for the campus and he added that
the Central Administration was
relatively supportive of his re-
quests.

(‘ompetltion

Benezet said that students
should remember that SUNY
Albany tnust compete dollar for
dollar with both public and state
supported private schools for state
monies. He added that enrollment
at both the state and private
schools has leveled off.

the President reported that this
University will compensate for the
excess enrollment faced this year
primarily by limiting the number of
rricorning freshmen next year.

the "workload" of the University

sooner do I stand tip to ask a ques-

tion or raise an issue. then they

Waterman referred in her com—
plaint to the attempt by some
Senators to have her ruled out of
order. .thus ending what could
have been an embarrassing dis-
closure. While their attempt failed.
the entire issue of the Sirotkin
memo was skimmed over lightly.
Several questions were asked:

0: Why was point one of the
memo included in the considera-
tion of a tenure case'.’

Vice President Sirotkin yielded
the floor to Bruce Marsh. chair-
man of the Committee on
promotions and Continuing Ap-
pointments. who responded by
claiming that the Senate guidelines
provided for such information to
be included in tenure considera-
iii)".

Tenure Quotas

Waterman contended that this
information provtding along with
the candidate‘s letter of transmittal
rt study on the rank and tenure dis-
tribution in his department) was
tantamount to a confession of a
tcriure quota.

Sirotkin denied that such an in-
tent was part of his memo. which
lie scored Dr. Waterman on since
the memo was issued before the
Senate guidelines were passed in
September I973.

Waterman again asked Sirotkin
why he insisted thatall information
requested in his memorandum be
kept separate from the official file
of the tenure candidate ifthe intent
was not to keep this file secret from
the candidate. Sirotkin replied,
and Marsh agreed that there never
was an intent to keep the files
separate but that in fact. they
would by open to general scrutiny.
.\'o explanation was given as to
why the request for separate files
was ritade iii the first place. Water»
