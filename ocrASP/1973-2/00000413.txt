“I‘m eonvmced that as we com-
municate with others and relate
our resources moredirectly to the
analysis of current problems the
University will be enormously

- enriched as well."

The Institute will cooperate with
the Commission of Critical
Choices fonAmerica‘. Both the In-
stitute and the Commission are
outgrowths of the original New
.York State Study on the Roles of
.a Modern State in a Changing
World.

The first priority ofthe Institute.
which initially will be administered
by the University‘s central staff in
Albany. will betto assemble and in-
tegrate the basic information and
trends data required for successful
policy analysis . The ultimate goal
ofthe Institute. using this data. will
betoidentify and analyze emerging
economic and social problems and
to develop and weigh alternate
public policy responses for the
State and the nation.

“The problems with which con-_
temporary society mustdeal“ saidl
Boyer. “are staggering in both
number and complexity. Many of
these problems are familiar-such as
social welfare. intergovernmental
relations. employment. aging. in-
dustrial growth. the environment.
crime and criminal justice. health
care. taxation and governmental
ﬁnance. Other problems are
emerging-such as energy. food. raw
materials. international economic
competition, international securi-
ty. transportation. land use. and
others."

Fiscal Surplus For ’73

by Stan Kaufman

Things are indeed looking up for
FSA. The predictions are that our
favorite campus monopoly will
wind up the fiscal yar I974 in the
black. for the first time in quite a
longtime.

'I'he Faculty~Student Associa-
tion has been losing money since
I970. In I972 it lost 203 thousand
dollars. But for the fiscal year en-
ding last June 30. the news was
good. in fact worthy ofcelcbration.
FSA had lost only 26 hundred
dollars. It was like the year the
Mets finished ninth for the first
time. They weren‘t winning yet.
but things were looking up.

l-‘SA Director E. Norbert Zahm.
the man in a great way responsible
for FSA‘s remarkable recovery.
has been otit of'towti this week. and
thus we have been unable to ascer-
ttiiti the secret to his success. Ac-

FSA has been supported. for the
most part, by contract meal
students. Bob Kannrck expresseda
popular sentiment among students
in claiming that the dining halls
should bear less ofaburden infun-
ding FSA. especially now that the
corporation has stopped losing
money.

The inequity which dorm
dwellers face by supporting FSA
would of course be remedied if
each service generated its own

which FSA is striving. but tintil

University and College. all
Technical and Agricultural schools
and from 4 state regions represen-
ting the two yettr community

on a ratio of one delegate per 3.500
students. A total of no delegates

Chancellor Boyer of SUNY
made his expected appearance at
the Assembly and warned of possi-

that he personally would not
recommend such increases.

The Sunday session marked the
climax of the Assembly weekend
with the vote to incorporate
SASU. Inc. into the Student
