‘Rough Sledding’ Seen for Albany Democrats

 

On Witnessing
the Decline

of a Machine

by Bob Mayer

It was an election night in
Albany and for an overwhelming
majority of Albanians sensing
some insignificance, it was just
another Tuesday evening. The
streets remained dull; the air, cold
and empty. The tenth lloor of 75
State Street was lit up, miraculous-
ly surviving the deadncss of the
downtown business district.

it was not necessary to tell the
elevator operators in the dingy lob-
by what ﬂoor you wanted. It it was
after 5:00 pm. there was an elec-
tion. and they and their old hand-
operated elevators would move III
struggle upward to the ul'lices ol
the Democratic Party.

The room swelled with eati-
didates. their relatives, and old

by Mike lgoe

Albany's Democratic Party.
which has beeniin control of city
politics {or 52 years, may find rou-
gh sledding ahead in upcoming
elections.

That. at least. is the opinion of
some observers of Albany politics
when they speak about Tuesday‘s
election results.

In the mayoral race, incumbent
Erastus Corning Ileked out a 3.000
vote victory over Republican-
Independent challenger Carl
'l'otihey. As election returns
became nearly complete late

Tuesday night. it be

came evident that Corning‘s
prediction of a 20.000 vote margin
Ul victory was considerablylarger
than reality In fact. the usually
sedate Corning seemed visibly
shaken while appearing on a news
program at a time when he was
only |.()()() votes ahead.

Despite the defeat, 'l’ouhey
called his showing a “milestone and
a breakthrough in Albany
polities " and noted that the people
til \lhany “hencclorlh are going to
demand and get good. clean
gmci‘nrnciit - or else."

[he challenge presented by
lotilicy was wrthotit a doubt the

years. in terms ol both the tally .

merit could be seen prominently in
downtown Albany. Atop a
building at the comer of State and
Pearl stood a bright red, white and
blue billboard declaring “Re-elect
Mayor Corning."

During the campaign. both can-
didates embarked on extensive
door-to-door meet the people
drives. Also. the traditional get
togethers were more frequent. in
contrast to other election years.
For Corning. gatherings ranged

November 14 to inspect city
records.

Although the Republicans did
lose two important elections. there
was not a complete feeling of loss at
campaign headquarters in the
Hyatt House. The Republicansdid
manage to capture two county
jtidgeships. District Attorney Ar-
nold l’roskin was elected to the
Albany Country Court and
Larence Kahn took the Surrogate
Court post. This marks the first

‘The close losses may
actually represent victories
for the Republicans’

from a visit on Benson Street to a
party at the Soul Shack; for
'l'ouhey. a rally at Washington
Park and a cocktail hour at the
Hyatt House Hotel were among
the outings.

An old hand in Albany politics
\\ ho doesn‘t wish to be ideiitilied
oilered some comments on Cor-
ning's slim victory:

"'l he people ol Albany are
generally lcd tip with what has been
going on. People will only tolerate

Republicans have been elected to
county judgeships in Albany.

In other city election results.
Democrats claimed victory in the
races for County Clerk. Common
Council President. City'l'reasurer,
(‘ity(‘ourt Judge, Coroner. and
Slicrill.

One thing should be notedabout
the victory of Jack McNulty for
Sheriff. In primary held last June,
McNulty beat party designate
William Mahoney for the nomina-
tion. It is felt by many that McNul-
ty could present a challenge to the
leadership of the O‘Connell people.
In addition to being popular in
Albany. as the primary indimted.
Me Nulty reportedly has ﬁve coun-
ty legislators loyal to him. in-
cluding his brother William, He also
draws on a broad base of pwcr
from Green Island. where he is
mayor.

Thus. it appears that the
Republican Party has made some
serious inroads into the
Democratic hold on Albany. The
close losses may actually represent
a victory {or theRepublicans. The
results of this election may be the
early signs of the death of the
O'Connell machine in the city of
Albany.
