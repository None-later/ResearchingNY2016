' see hints was treatedvto keen in-

sights 'r'fgChina as seen‘ through the
eyes or he Australian bomspeaker

’ who has visited China on several

occassions.

His ﬁrst visit to the mainland
came in 1964 (well before the Nix-
on and Kissinger trips) through the
permission of the Chinese embassy
in'IWarsaw. which granted him a
visa. It was during this first visit
that Terrill noticed the Chinese
people were, “Recovering from
their past and their poverty."

The pastthat Terrill cited as be-
ing disastrous to the Chinese peo-
ple came as a result of her en-
counter with the Western world.
According to Terril. the trouble
began in the early nineteenth cen-
tury when the imperialist nations
of Western and Eastern Europe
began exploiting the economic
riches of China. Because of the
weakness of the government. the
Chinese were taken advantage of
by Russia and Japan throughout
the nineteenth and into the twen-
tieth century. It was because ofthis
constant barrage of exploitation
that China could no longer cope
with and hence was brought to
ruins by the hands of foreign rule.
Terril explains. Says
Terrill: “The ,Chinese were not
masters in their own house."

During a more recent visit in
1971. Terrill was able to ask
Premier Chou Enllai his views on
this practice of exploitation by
other nations. Chou‘s reply was.
“China should control its own
destiny and above all China willin-
sist on her independence."

 

Dr. Terrill's talk then switched
to the [poverty problem which the
Chinese peoplearestitl recovering

 from. Terrills'aid’that Westerners
have clearly "underestimated how
underdeveloped the country still
is." Speaking in terms‘ofstatistics.
Terrill said that the current
Chinese population falls near the
850 million mark (about 14 the
world population) with annual in-
creases of between l5-l6 million.

Social Atmosphere

Dr. Terrill next 'tumed to a dis-
cussion of the social atmosphere in
China. ‘ He said that the basic
policies ofthe Chinese Communist
Party are very similar to the views
expressed in Confucianism which
constitutes a set of ethics about
social relationships. In other
words. it is hoped that through the
revolutionary efforts ofsuch men
as Chairman Mao Tse-tung and

Terrill Tells About China

For a country this size it is shock-
ing to find that it consumes only 5-
6 per cent of the world‘s goods.
Terrill continued by expressing his
observations that China is “still ex-
tremely backward.“ Evidence of
this backwardness can be seen in
the rural and village regions (80 per
cent of Chinese population is
found there) where the fields are
still plowed by hand.Because the
“methods of agriculture have not
changed. the economic progress of
China has been relatively show."
As far as ﬁnancial well-being is
concerned. Terrill noted that in a
country where the average annual
income per capita is $200. one does
not find mtny luxuries. However.
it was soon pointed out that the
$200 figure may be quite deceiving.
as Terrill said that. “Necessities are
there and are cheap. but there are
no luxuries." Just as Americans
may View their cars as necessities.
so the Chinese feel about their
bicycles. As Terrill explained.
there are about five million bicycles
in central Peking alone and “'in
Peking. ti bicycle is probably as

Premier Chou En-lai the internal
standards of living will be vastly
improved. These efforts to im-
prove the lives of the Chinese has
been clearly evidenced by the
noticeable gains in education. For
instance. it has been estimated that
at the time of the Chinese Com-

The Chinese are
“recovering from
their past and

their poverty."

Inunist revolution the national
literacy rate was between IOand l5
percent. Figures reveal that the
literacy rate is now between 80 and
85 percent. Terrill explained that it
is not uncommon to see peasants
reading. In this respect. the
Chinese peasant is modern; unique
to this Asian country alone.
What has made the educational
system in China so successful is
this; it is believed that Mao had at
one time been worried about a frac—

 

tionalizati

ideological practice’s between the

industrial and rural dwellers.’ In
order to minimize that possibility.
a vigourouscampaign was organiz-
ed to boost interest and attendance
in schools. Since that time. Terrill
explained. “Middle school educa-
tion has becomealmost universal.“
As another part of this education
effort. a birth control drive has
been under way for a short while

now.

l'errill noted however. that there
is still great uncertainty about
ltiglicr education. To begin with.
there simply is not enough univer-
sity space available for everyone to
beneﬁt from. But even with what
is presently being taught. there is
uncertainty as to what cati be
taught. For example. most of the
physical sciences and mathematics
are readily accepted. but as far as
social and human studies go. there
is still a degree of tension. Terrill
summarized by saying. “The C0 m—
munist Party is still distrustful of
higher education."

Politics

Politically and militarily. Terrill
believes China . has reduced .hc
high leveer pitch present in the
years immediately following the
revolution. ferrill accounted for
this casing in the political and
military atmosphere by'referrlng
back to the cultural revolution ol
the 1960‘s. It was at the height of
Red (iuard activity that Mao

WAS HINGTON. DC (CPS)- A
recent study by the Educational
IT esting Service (ETS) has con-
firmed that Vietnam veterans get
considerably less beneﬁts than the
benefits provided for World War II
veterans.

The study says. “When
educational allowances for the
Vietnam veteran are adjusted for
the average tuition. fees, books.
and supplies at a tour-year
public institution. the beneﬁts
remaining are insufficient to meet
the veteran‘s estimated living ex-
penscs.“

The World War It G.l. Bill
offered single vets up to $500 per
year for books. tuition. and fees.
plus $75 a month for subsistence.
today‘s beneﬁts give veterans $220
a month to cover everything.

“It is apparent that inllation and
It rising standard ol’ living have

In a letter to the New York
TfIIlPS in March. VA ad-
ministrator Donald Johnson said
the "present Isingle veteran
allowance of $l980 for a school
year is nearly three times the World
War [I allowance and gives most'
veterans more monetary assistance
than after World War II. even:
allowing for inflation and in-“
creased school costs.“

But the ETS report diagrees:
“The five-fold increase in the .
average tuition of four-year private '
institutions by I973. coupled with
the cos‘ of books and supplies. re-
quires the Vietnam veteran with
