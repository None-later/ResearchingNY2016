I-Corning’s Last Stand

on Tuesday the Albany political machine was nearly dismantled. Eight term
Mayor Erastus Corning ekcd out only a 3,000 vote margin over Carl Touhey, while
he had. been predicting all along that he would win by 20,000 votes.

Only a few observers thought the race would be so close. Brit was it really so sur-
prising that Touhey did well? 'We think not.

The 8‘ 1C investigations were an important factor in his favor. They turned up
what may be the most appalling corruption existing in any Americancity police
department. Also important was the lowering of the voting age to l8, enfranchising
young people who tend to be more independent and less tradition bound.

Furthermore, the machine operators are old. The typical committeeman is about
60 years of age and many are even older. They are simply not capable of doing the
same job they used to do, particularly when one considers that many of the regular
party voters are also old-some now too old to get to the polls, and others in
cemeteries;

Finally, the machine has been under greater scrutiny in recent years, and the
number of favors delivered to party faithfuls has consequently declined. The
machine is poorer than it used to be.

This latestelection was probably the machine‘s last victory. It has four more years
tolive. In order to survive beyond that time. it Would need more than some oil and a
few spare parts. Even a complete overhaul would not do. For there will be no place
for machine government in the American city of the 1980’s.

Not Crying Wolf

The oil shortage is no joke. It is easy to remain unconvinced] about the need for
energy conservation, and to believe that much ofthe shortage is being manufac-
tur ed by the oil companies in order to justify price hikes, force out independent
competitors, and build pressure forthe Alaska Pipeline. Or. perhaps it isanother of
Nixon‘s diversionary tactics.

It is quite cleaiJ‘, however, that the Arab countries have cut oil shipn'ignt's to the Un-
ited States. and that the oil industry’s claims may very well be justified.
lfthat is the case, as we think it is, then everyone is going to have to contribute to the
effort to save power. Students do not have to emulate Lincoln and read by ﬁre-
light, but they can help by dousing unnecesary lights, and by forming car pools
when going on home weekends. " IV
.But by and large. the burden ofthe conservation effort rests with the large private
industriesand govermnent institutions. Too many large office buildings remain
entirely litat night, and there are too malty super expressways and interchanges
across the country which do not have to be lit at 3:00 AM.

The big ﬁrms are the big power users. It is their responsibility to set an example
for us small power users.

Somethin’s ’Rotkin In Daneland

The Senate Meeting Monday afternoon was a classic case showing the inability to
come to grips with a plaguing problem. 'lhe discovery of another Vice-Presidential
memorandum, issued by Philip Sirotkin only to Academic Deans deserves an in-depth
study as to the legitimacy ofthisAdministratrion‘slclaim to innocence’l'he memoscemed
to clearly prove that Vice-President Sirotkin has no respect for the tenure system as it
exists at this institution, no matter how unfair that system is. It appears that sufficient
question has been raised as to [)r. Sirotkin‘s motives with respect to the issue oftenurc
that blanket denials by him and his supporters can no longer go unquestioned.

Dr. Waterman pointed out a number of perplexing inconsistencies in this Ad—
ministration‘s approach to the question. Why did l)r. Sirotkin request that a separate
file be kept ofa tenure candidate? Why did he ask for information not even mentioned
in the Senate Guidelines? for example, his memo asks for a departmental workload
analysis. Nowhere does this appear in the guidelines. Why does he want to know the
breakdown of tenure distribution in the particular department if not to base tenure tit
least in part on a quota system'.’

Finally. why, if President lienelet claims that the Department have the most inl'luen»
tial voice in tenure cases. is the memo addressed only to the Academic Deans. [bushy-I
passing the departmental level altogether?

“the purpose of this memorandum was ltlct‘lilhllhlltl secret lilc on tenure ctiiidtdiitcs
such that the possibility of subvertitigthe entire process of tenure is not oitt of the Ad-
ministration‘s grasp, then it is the dutytind the obligation ol the University Senate-to iti-
vestigatc with till due liiistc this. the most recent of thc conti trinig tenure mystctics.

To the Editor:

In behalf of the members of the “save
Carver Health Center" project committee,
there are many acknowledgements and
thank-yous to be made public. We feel that
this is especially important bectiusc our work
for the Community could not have been
done without the University Community
support. the Central Council. classes, and
hundreds of concerned University members.

Carver. and the committee. were especial-
ly pleased and proud of three of the four
cl' scs on campus. They took the time to
listen to our cause (which consequently
hecamethcir causeltind donated appreciable
amounts. The Seniors were an inspiration to
the rest of the University by donating
S|25.l)0, the Juniors followed suit with
“00.00 and the Sophomores $50.00. Stan-
ding above the rest of the (ircck
organizations, Kappa Beta proved human
concern with a $25.00 donation. Adding to
that the nursing students. students. and
[ziciilty members, iind we are on our way to
$700.00. just 30 per cent short of otir goal.
Being new at this game, we now realize mis-
tttkes we have made. but we also see the
human goodness accomplished. llic l'iiivcr—
sity. in the eyes of the public, no longer
stands cloistered. an entity. but rather tin iti-
tegrul part of the community.

Our special thanks go otit to the ('entrtil
('ouncil. who took a strong stand lot us
through a billcntillcd "Restoration of ('om-
miiiiity Health Centers.“ and consequent
news releases. Also. though difficult the lines
ol communication became. the ASP proved
to he ofgreat service to us. and the reporting
by Sue Leboff was factually coricci tllld ex-
ccllcnlly written.

tttbiisht-‘ti' with members of the athletic.
department and the basketball team. lasked
"Doc" how he would feel if the administra-
tion told him tomorrow that he would not
longer be coaching because they were hiring
it “rookie coach“ with a lot of potential to
lilift,‘ his place. I‘m stire he can see my posi-
tion and how I feel. It might not be a perfect
analogy bttt I think it makes my point.

I have been asked about my future plans
by some people who havt taken interest. I
pliin to possibly transfer to it Physical
l‘ducution school next year wheie lean pur-
stlc tl coaching career. Playing ball elsewhere
would be a rather difficult situation since I
would have to sit out another year of in-
eligibility because of NCAA transfer rule. l
have no bitter feelings towards any of the
btillpltiyers and I would like to wish Byron
and the rest of the team luck for the coining
season. I only wish that l cotild be out there
\Hlll tlictn this year.

I hope that lliiivccndcd this discussion for
good now. I really don‘t care to appear on

out lest .Bmuments developed that "Would
preventiany reallearning in bunches”

 

Mr. Thompson stated that he did not wish V
to blow this incident out of proportion; why.

then. did he feel compelled to mention that. ,

"...thc instructor, a iotanitm..."- would he
have felt less inclined to object if the instruc-
tor wusu man? A question of sexism already
arises: how many more could come up in the
class? - bickering about whether we as
women seek anv "superiors elitist position"
(which we do not) does not lend to a good
classroom experience. Wearc seeking "only"
our own identities and the chance to express
them to other women without anyone of the
opposite sex there to debate anything we say,
not because we are afraid, but because we are
searching. “A classroom setting" is not
always the ideal place for “interaction
between the sexes" when “the sexes“ is the
topic.

If Mr. Thompson sees us as attempting
“psychological tllld social castration of
males" why does he so much want to be in the
cliiss‘.’ 'l‘o argue? That. too. is self-defeating!
Also’without any offense intended,l want to
lastly point out such phrases as. “The sexist
notion thiit l was iii the class because of the
women or for some social gain. 15
groundless..." "S eking not to blow this
hopefully isolated incident out of its true
proportion..." “Some may attempt to call
this article male bitching'...“-—these are very
defensive phrases, and defensiveness. ex-
ploitation by presentation of one very biased
~1th of tin incident in very cliched ex-
pressions and platitudcsvis precisely what
we are trying to avoid by preferring women
otil_\ lll ling. Ill}.

lhcsc. tllld only these. tire the reasons that
\lt lhompson was asked tti let the women

in the class lend the discussions.

_ them. So why even think abouttheresults of .
Multiple Sclerosis or gunshot wounds orcar
accidents?

More and more people are thinkingabout
these things.- More advanced .med'
knowledge is keepingvmgretdlsabled peopl
alive. Also the disabled people themselvej
are coming out of the” woodwork. They no
longer stay at home, nor should they; I

All person‘s using the SUNYA cainpus
needn‘t suffer in order to achieve‘ the goalsof
one small group. SIPH doesn‘t wish all
others on campus to acquire a temporary or
permti nent disability! They only Want others
to see things as they set: them- looking up a
flight of stairs or through a 22inch doorwy
while seated in a 26 inch wide wheelchair.
They only want others to support their ef-
forts to eliminate these barriers to their in-
dependent living.

tt‘s not just the present or future han—
dicapped SUNYA population that has need
of an accessible campus. All handicapped
persons in the community who wish to at-
tend concerts. seminars. or occasional
courses should have complete access to
SUNYA also.

pretented us from loving each other. even
though our generation is into “free love."
"love thy neighbor.“ etc. Love is the most
beautiful of “II feelings. yet we aretaught not
to Itll't‘. especially not to love those of our
sex. In this society. how can I say “I LOVE
YOU" to people? I do love my fellow man. I.
one iigtinis‘. many. do truly love. not with ‘tl
sexual connotation. but with sincere
Iricndshtp. But why does society prevent my

It is impossible (or rather. society tttu/rtti it
