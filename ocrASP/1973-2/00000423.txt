siren Look to Youth

by Vinny Reda

The emphasis with the TAIbany.
golf team. as it seems to be
everywhere these days. is on youth.
(‘oaclt Richard (Doc) Siiuers made
that decision in the middle of his
team‘s season this fall. Hr: says.
"We have players on this team who
are going to be good - very good.
We find others on the team this
year who did not seem that they
would ever play any better golf. i
decided to go with the men who
had the most potential."

the improvement was slow lltlh
ycar. bttl it finally began to pay off
incur the season's end. Jim
l’orreca. a freshman shot a 73 in
tllL' Eastern Collegiate Athletic
Conference (ECAC) rcgionzils at
Syracuse. New York. It was the
best score by eight strokes for an
Albany golfer this year. He was
soon followed in the clubhouse
that tame day by sophomore .loi'
Mc('o._ . and his fine score of 7X.

l-orrcca's round gained butt 2i
bcrlhitithc [{CAC finals at Sutton.
Massachusetts. Although he did
not advance very far iii the lllltll\.
His ability to qualify lor them was
an outstanding feat for a freshman

Netters Finish Season

by Vinny Red:

The SUNYA tennis team com-
pleted its season on a good note.
finishing third in the State Univer—
sity Championships. held on Oc-
tobur l2~13at the SUNY at Cor-
tlatid campus. Although last year‘s
team had been a close second to
()nconla's powerful lineup. this
year‘s squad gave an equally
creditable performance. ()neonta
won. as they have six times since
I9ti7. but only by a 29-25 margin
tl\t.'l' \ihat Albany tennis coach
Bob leii'is termed. “a vastly im-
proicd (‘ortland team." Albany

l7 points.

comeback for tliis.spring transfer

LaHaise.
Bob Diskin. playing second

seed, did even better, advancing to g

the ﬁnals before losing. He was
Albany's highest tournament
finisher. just as he was their most
successful duel meet performer
with it perfect 6—0 record. Only a
sophomore. be advanced from his
number six position on the team
freshman year.

It was this type of improvement
which has most pleased Lewis this
year. After losing three varsity men
from last year's team. he realized
that only determined individual cf-
l’ort by his players overthesummer
could keep Albany in a favorable
position among the top state un—
t\‘L‘l'§lly teams. He got just that
from Kcstcnbaum. Diskin. and
also .Ioslt Council. who advanced
from the junior varsity to be this
year‘s number three seed with a fine
S—I duct mcet record.

th Lewis feels he got somewhat
lL'xs trom other players. He states.

“I am not satisﬁed with my four,
ﬁve. and six playerst They didn't
work outall-sumrn'er. I‘m not
criticizing them." It‘s just a
fact. Our one, two .ahd three men
were strong but there seems to be a
drop in talent afier that.“ I ‘

Lewis refers to Jon Weinberg
(No. 4), Leo Stemlich (No. 5).an'u
Stephen Taylor (No. 6). His point
may be justsiﬁed as none of these
men signiﬁcantly improved their
position from last year‘s team. '

All three, however, did reach tlie
semi-ﬁnals oftheconferencc cham-
pionships. They. like the other
team members. have further poten-
tial and more time to prove
themselves. both in this coming
spring season and the following
year.

What this all points to is a con-
tinuation of a solid Albany State
tennis program which could keep
(‘oiicli Bob lewis satisﬁed for
some time to come.
