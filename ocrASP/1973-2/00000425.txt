Molestation Alleged at Stony Brook

STONY BROOK (SASU) - A
Stony Book co-ed claims her
Chemistry teacher molested her
and promised to"repay her with an
“A”. The freshman student. whose
name has been witheld, alleges the
teaching assistant invited herto his
dormitory room to offer her help
on a classroom assignment. and,
once there. forcibly assaulted her.

“I had no real qualms about go-
im ' into his room,” the young
woman said. "I preferred to re-
main in the hall. thinking we would
go back to the Chem building after
he got some books. but he asked
me to step into the room."

The Student clairrrs Harris shut
the door behind her and pulled her
into his lap. "I told him that I

preferred to stand, but he gripped
me and said, ‘What is your
problem?“ and. quite frankly, I was
afraid to move."

The young woman claims she
freed herself momentarily. "but he
pulled me down onto his lap again
and began moving his hands all
over me." After astruggle. she says.
she broke free and fled the room.

Subsequently. she filed a com-
plaint agiinst the teaching assis-
tant with Dr. Sei Sujishi, chairman
of Stony Brook's Chemistry
Department. Sujishi has placed her
in another class, but has taken no
further action.

The student is considering lodg-
ing a formal complaint againstthe

teaching assistant with the Suffolk
County Police Department. She
has also accused Stony Brook Un-
iversity ofﬁcials with covering up
the incident.

Sujishi has denied the cover-up
allegation. “We are sensitive to her
feelings...therc is something that
happened. But we don't know
who‘s guilty or not guilty." He adds
that the Chemistry Department is
not conducting an investigation
into the charges.

The campus security force at
Stony Brook is conducting an in-
vestigation. but would not com-
ment on it when contacted by a
reporter from The Statesman, the
University‘s student newspaper.

- a host of things which go back
three years. At that time a small
group of students began exerting
pressure for a birth control clinic.
l)r. llood checked out the idea ex—
tensively but there was one major
hold-up which it was impossible to
get around. That was the law which
required parental consent for girls
rlrrdcr twenty-one who wished to
receive contraceptives. The
pressure group understood this
and eventually backed off.
However. the law was changed in
I971. lowering tltc age to eighteen.
Since then Dr. Hood reports that
she has been working for the in-
auguralionsol the clinic.

Another reason that it took so
long was that Dr. Hood wanted a
top quality program with cir—
pcricnccd personnel and a high
dcgrcc ol organilatlon. But
probably illc deciding factor was a
young man on a Rockefeller Form.
