Gall-oi Wines New. Target ofUFW Boycott

by Bob Barber

Livingston. Ca. (.CPS) Some of
the best-selling wines on college
campuses are the target of it new
boycott campaign by California
farmworkers and their supporters
around the country. These are
nearly a dozen wines produced by
E. and J. Gallo Winery. the largest
wine-producing corporation in the
United States.

For three months this summer,
Gallo was the target of a strike by
several hundred year-round field
workers and regular seasonal
harvest workers. They demanded
Gallo rescind the contract signed
with the joint Teamsters union in
July andrcviewits expired contract
with the United :armworkcrs Un-
ion. first signed in I967. The
tcainster contracts were signed
with only token consultation with
workers. causing observers to call
the Teamstcr power pact' a
" SWEE’I'HEART CON-
‘l’RAC 

This strike was part of a wave of
strikes by farmworkers
throughout California this
summer. strikes aimed at table and
“the grape growers who signed
with the Teamsters in what many
farmworkers charged was a coor-
dinated ellort todcstroythc UFW.

I'hi: UFW had sought to hurt
gi'ovver profits by slowing down the
harvest with pickets in the fields.
urging more workers to join the
strike. But pickcting was abruptly
halted last August when twu
strikers were killed in the culmina-
tion of weeks of violence directed
against the vineyard pickets.

Unable to effect economic
pressure in the fields UFW shifted
its emphasis to a consumer
boycott and the cities.

Now nearly a hundred of the
(iallo Workers have gone to major
cities throughout the country to
picket liquor and grocery stores.
urgriig tlte storcowncrs to take
(iallo wrnes off their shelves until
the company stgiis with the UFW.

In addition. a National Student
(i‘rlIItl Boycott committee has been
formed by several student govern—
ment officers at the University of
California at Berkeley. I'his coin-
nuitce originated altcr UFW direc-
tor (‘esar Chavez spoke to a
National Studcrit Association
met-ting earlier this year. Accor-
ding to a spokeswoman for the
group. corrtacl has been made wttli

The task of the boycott is a for-
midable one. for (iallo produces
one third of all the Wine sold iii the
tits lit l‘)7|. 'Iiriii' .Wllg’ilitllt’
estimated. the company made a

proﬁt of $40 million on sales of I l0
million gallons.

Many of Gallo‘s wines are low-
priced wines. often called “Pop
wines.“ aimed at college students
and the youth market. Many of its
products do not carry the com-
pany‘s name on the label. but any
wine labelled “Modesto. Califor-
nia.“ is made by Gallo. Examples
are Boone's Farm. Ripple. Red
Mountain. and Sanada.

This summer‘s strike at the Gallo
vineyards in Livingston scverly cut
back on (iallo‘s grape harvest this
year. although the company was
able to harvest some grapes by su-
ing strikcbr-akers from elsewhere
in the state. But since (iallo btrys
lit) percent of its grapes front other
smaller growers in California. tltc
boycott will have to be the UFW's
strongest weapon in winning
back the contract.

lhc Ubw contract. first won in
HM. provided protection and
oporttinitics never before available
to the (iallo workers-increased
wages. a medical plan paid for by
the company. protection against
irrational pesticide use. and thejob
security provided by the tinion hir-
ing hall. which replaced the
notorious labor contractor system.

Conversations with the workers
indicate that most important ad-
vantages were the new—found op.
porttinitics for self-governittcnt
among the Workers and the dis-
covery of the power to challenge
the company and its abuse of its
workers. The major mechanism
lot this was the ranch committee. a
group ol five Workers elected by all
the other vyurkcrs who handle all
disputes with the company.

Under the 'l'camster contracts
signed by (iallo earlier this year.
the medical plan. pesticide protec-
tion. the hiring hall. and the ranch
coininitttee are conspicuous in
their absence.

almost all its regular workers were

PIRG Growing Around

The State and Nation

by Kay Joslln

(CPS) - One of the most signifi-
cant student efforts today is a
nationwide network of non-proﬁt.
non-partisan consumer interest
organizations known as Public In-
terest Research Groups (PIRG).
Originated three years ago at the
inspiration of Ralph Nader.
I’I R65 are now located in 23 states
and in England. Canada and
Australia.

The student—funded
organizations represent the con-
cerns of college students but state
their goals as constructive social
change to benefit all citilens. The
I’IRGs were initiated on many
campuses as a result of efforts by
Nader Raider Donald Ross.and by
an efficient team of volunteers.
lawyers and professionals.

The I’lR(is have bccnestablish-
ed on campuses by petition drives
and student referendums which if
successful. enable the organization
to collect an optional. refundable
lee ofSl to $3 per student per term
at registration. Students may par—
ticipatc in PIRG projects for
academic credit. part-time work or
on a volunteer basis.

lhc research groups ha\e dealt
vvrtlt pi obleins iit consumer protec-
iioii. health care delivery. landlord—
tctiarit relationships. occupational
safety. protection of natural
resources and environmental
tillilIlU. and racial arid sevtral dis-
ctirtrtiittliiiri. Some groups
cmphast/c local concerns such as
stiip mining legislation. oil shale
development. nuclcar pirvvci plant

PIRG action is not limited to
campuses. many PlRGs have
aligred themselves with communi-
ty action organilations and en—
courage citizens participation on
PIRG projects. Some PIRGs are
being organized on the high school
level.

The oldest PIRG is in Oregon
(OSPIRG). where first year 250 un-
ivcrsity classes participated in I60 ,
PIRG projects. OSPIRG was in-
strumental in Oregon‘s successful
campaign to clean up the
Willamette River and worked to
insure passage of Oregon's or-
dinance outlawing tin cans.

The largest statewide PIRG
network. in Minnesota. spans l8
campuses and has a budget of over
5200.000. '

In Texas PIRG documented
cases of hiring practiced bytlie City
of Austin and various state agen-
cies which discriminated against
women. The findings were
reported to the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. the at-
torney general and the governor of
chas. They were able to insure
that no state funds would be given
to agencies that discriminated
against women.

Controversv over the construc-
tion of a free try from New York
City to Maine led to a coalition of
Vermont and Massachusetts
l’lRtis in art attempt to force the
coristitictroncompany'to file ancn-

White House Says
Another Tape Gone

WASHINGTON AP - The
White House is unable to ﬁnd a
subpoenaed dictation machine
recording made by President Nix-
on after a key Watergate conversa-
tion. White House lawyer J. Fred
Buzhardt testiﬁed today.

Disclosure in federal court that
the recording doesn‘t exist was
made a few minutes before Nixon
announced he will turn over to
Judge John J. Sirica notes. dic—
taion belts and other Watergate-
related White House tapes.

Nixon said he wants to clear up
“once and for all“ doubts about
two other crucial Watergate con-
versations the White House says
went unrecorded.

Buthardt said he first learned a
week ago. from White House chief
of staff Alexander M, Haig Jr..
that a search had failed to turn up
the belt recording. which was being
sought by federal Watergate
prosecutors.

It is the third piece of sub-
poenaed Watergate evidence that
the White House now says doesn't
exist.

Buzhardt told special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox last
June that President Nixon had dic—
tated his impressions ofa meeting
he had held April IS. I973 with
ousted counsel John W. Dean III.

The White House says the
Nixon-Dean meeting itself went
unrecorded because an unattended
tape recorder ran out of tape.

litixhai'dt said a search was
made for the belt recording of Nix-
on‘s impressions. btit that only
some written notes could befouiid.

Dean Itas testified that in the
April l5 mectingthc President ad-
mitted discussing executive
clemency as part of the Watergate
cover-tip. and that Nixon said he
had only been joking on an earlier

occasion when he said it would be
no problem to raise SI million in
hush money.

The other subpoenaed tape
recording the White House says
doesn‘t exist was a June 20. I972
conversation between Nixon and
former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell.

The White House had told
special Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox. who has since been
fired. that Nixon dictated onadcsk
recorder his own impressions of a
meeting with his ousted counsel
John W. Dean III the night of
April 15.1973.

No such recording exists.
Buzhardt told the court.

The phantom dictabelt recor-
dingisinadditiontotwoothertape
recordings which the White House
says do not exist.

Watergate prosecutors had
sought recordings ofconversations
of the April [5 Nixon-Dean
meeting itselfand ofa June 20. I972

“In the ﬁrst place." she said in an
hour-long interview. “I don‘t think
President Nixon should be, will be
impeached  no. I don't think he
should resign."

And how does Mrs. Ford feel
when she hears talk of impeach-
ment and resignation of President
Nixon at the same time her butt-
band is going through conﬁrma-
tion hearings in the Senate?

other things. about Watergate.

“I think that really and truly it
will probably take a long time to
get to the bottom of the testimony

think that in the end. it‘s go-
ing to work out all right for Presi-
dent Nixon.“ she said.

Eli/.abeth Bloomer Ford. at 55.

making city of Grand Rapids.

Mrs. Ford is a tall. stately
woman with high cheek bones and
a reddish bouf'fant hair style. The
years of political campaigning and
pressures have left only a few
wrinkles around her gray-blue
eyes. A pinched nerve in her neck -
the result of trying to open a win-
dirty in the house nine years ago -
keeps her from the goll and skiing
she loves.

And lroni dancing. "Oh. I do
some dancing in the privacy of my

once did modern dance under the
direction of dance stars Martha

(‘hriilcx Wcrdman. “But lately. I
haven't had any chance to."
