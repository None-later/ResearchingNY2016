It has been generally agreed that the present statetofitheenergy crisis is as serious as
most experts claim. This country is critically short of oil. lts effects will be pervasive
in our society for some time to come. This country will now. by necessity. learn to
make do with less fuel.

The mechanisms by which this country, and in fact. the rest of the world. came to
this abrupt and discomforting realization is tragic. That any people can ransom off
the security ofthe world for its own political purposes is an act of barbary. if not one
of outright international blackmail.

Yet for all our protestations. the trip by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to
Saudi Arabia this past week proves that without a doubt that country and others of
that region have the ability to do just yvhat they want to with their oil, We will have to
face up to the fact that we will be short of oil for some time to come.

Certainly. this shortage is no laughing matter. and little can he said to support it.
yet a fatalistic point ofviewcan perhaps yield some ultimately assuring insights to the
present dilemma. This country has been using far too much oil for its own fttturc
security for quite some time now. Experts in the field have predicted an upcoming
shortage for years. though because that shortage never materialized. f‘ewtook heed.
The consumptive pace of this country is such that even a slight decrease in our fuel
supply would seriously damage this nation‘s economy. but worse still. Would
dramatically alter the very style of life that most affluent Americans have become
accustomed to.

No one would seriously accept such a drastic change and so preferred to deny the
imminence of the crisis. That the crisis came now is perhaps a valuable lesson for
American society. We now have no choice but to substantially alter our way of living.
We can no longer blindly accept the view that for all time there will be fuel enough to
power all the luxuries we have come to expect living in America.

Governor Rockefeller‘s decision to reduce all legal speed limits to a maximum of
50 miles per hour. will. after due consideration. be accepted as the least price we
should pay for our many years of unchecked prosperity. Perhaps slowing down is not
such a bad idea at all. Perhaps accompanying the decrease in speed will come a
reductionin the pace oflifc which has run as rampantas our desire for more and more
wealth. A reduction in our pace of life will not onlynot bedetrimcntal to ourcollective

being. it will inevitably be an important aid in restoring a sense of calm in a nation
that has had far too much to worry about.

Hear No Evil

it came as no surprise to learn that portions ofthe tapes (the ones that exist) are in—
audible. lt makes sense that an administration that spends close to a quarter of a
million dollars to redesignthe interior ofthe President‘s personalshuttle 707 can‘tin-
stall a tape recordingsystemthat works. After all. the system was installed to provide
an historical record ofthe doingsinthe White House for all posterity. Such a modest
task certainly doesn't deserve much appropriations. lt's onlyforthe record. and who
on earth would ever want to know what Richard Nixon had to say?

Every phone in the White House is bugged except of course the one that John
Mitchell happened to call on. There are miles of tape of Nixon‘s memoirs already
stored in the Executive Office Building, but it‘s only natural that there wasn‘t enough
tape in the machine to record whatJohn Dean had totell the President about the cor-
ruption in his government. And an Administration keen on the latest technological
breakthroughs of the CIA . bugs that can pick up a whisper at l00 paces. can't find a
microphone to pick uptalk ofWatergate. Surprised? Not f'romthis Ad ministration.
