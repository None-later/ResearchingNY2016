Are Poetry and Physics Poles Apart?

by Ricardo Nlrenberg

It is a curiousfact that humanists are often
the best propogandists of science, and scien-
tists can be the staunchest defenders of the
humanities. But in spite of the exaggerated
compliments on both sides, they remain
poles apart. and l have not seen much
meaningful dialogue between both sides of
the academic podium, except at College or
University committee meetings (if that kind
of dialogue can becalled meaningful). 'l‘nisl
was thinking while reading Mr. Staley's note
in praise ofirnagination. Mr. Staley. being a
Professor of English. naturally tries to make
his point by showing how important im-
agination is for the physicists. for which he
calls as witnesses famous scientcsts. past and
present. Now. I do believe that imagination
is an essential quality for a creative scientist.
as it is also for a first rate chess player. The
problem is. what kind of imagination? As
one‘ who has spent most of his adult life
working in mathematics. I have often wrung
that question in my own mind. only to in-
crease my original perplexity.

Mr. Staley quotes from Whitehead, that
master of the old logician-pedagogue tradi-
tion. to the effect that science making is our
modern Attic tragedy; the order of nature in
physics our rcmorselcss. indifferent fate.
True. catastropheisat the end of'bothclassic
tragedy and atomic physics. but in that sense
only can i agree with the parallel. Still others
have compared our search i or scientific truth
to the Homeric epic. and I‘m sure one can
imagine many comparisons equally gratify-
ing.

The drama. the epic and the myths of the
ancients. however. are concerned with man‘s
fate and the mysteries of man's soul or (as
we would say today). of itian‘sconsciousand
unconscious mind. [he gods were sometimes
cruel. sometimes remorselcss and in-
different. btrt in their dealings they re-
enactcd niaii‘s passions. and looked very
much like projections of a collective tiri-
conscioiis. Who can say that of physics'
elementary partielcs‘.’ As Whitehead himself
said elsewhere (“'lhe Anatomy of Sonic
Scientific file )1 "The characteristic of
physical science is. that it ignores all
judgments of value; for example. aesthetic or
moral Judgments." And here again. by the
way. he shows his logiciaii's beiii ol iiitrid.|or
physical science ignores indeed iill itidginciits
of value except for one at iisvcry basis" that
everything that happens in this World obeys
to some (possibly unknown) inaihciiiiiticiil
law. This principle, coming to us from
Pythagoras and I’lato through (talilco. is
both of an aesthetic and riioral ri.itiuc lltit
once this bll‘tlt.‘ principle is granted. it httlltlc

  
  

 

true that modern physics doesn't concern

itself any more with moral or aesthetic

values. To achieve this simplification of

making just one value judgment took of

course a long time. as it was impossible for

primitive scientists to separate matters-of-

fact from morals or aesthetics. When

Heraclitus says “You will not step twice into

the same river." he is stating an obvious
physical fact: "it is another river." and from
there. with wonderful dialectical skill (the
observation is Borges'). making us accept as
if we had discovered it. a second statement:
“I am another.“ which is far from bcingjust a
physical fact. This constant drift (or. as we
would call it today. confusion) between the
two worlds of Nature and Man. was more or
less characteristic of "science" up to the
seventeenth century; one can still notice it in
Leibnitr. or Newton. and has almost com-
pletely disappeared in our own time.
Nutiibers and geometrical figures used to
have mysterious powers. and the right way of
life was demonstrated geometrically: sub-
stances wouldjoin in mysticalchcmical wed-
dings. and one could speak at the same time
of the motions of the soul and of the in-
animate bodies. Now instead. electrons are
not even little botinding balls: thcy are it
bunch of niirnbersaiid a system ofcquations:
they have nothing in common with human
beings.

Titus inodci n pliysicsis very beautiful. but
how can you speak of it as being poet’ 2 Mr.
Staley speaks of the poetry of physi '
poetry. it seems to me. can only exist where
things liii\c a soul and a human incastire.aiid
poets cannot be biit antiiiistsand iilelicniists
at heart. Aiiimism anti alchemy being of-
ficially dcfriiict. poets today can not be biil
dissenters. and frankly. I do not envy their
position.

properties. such as enabling one to acquire

laugh when l‘cyfllllitfl. in his beautiful “l.cc-

iiuiivclousistlre iititli than any artists of the
past iiiiagtircd‘. Why do the poets of the pre-

The P.B.I.

On Thursday. November 8. I973 at the
Troppy Kal Fish Store. proprietor Kilgore
Minnow set the thermostats of three tanks
(containing rare Alaskan Snow Guppies) up
to 74 degrees. Since Interstate Commerce
was involved. the President's Bureau of In-
vestigation was called in. in charge of the
case was the President's Executive Adviser
for Conservation of Heat. Energy and

Separation —of—Powers (PEACHES). John
Cash.

Cash rode into Greenport riding the first-
prizcwinning soapbox (used only after
carefully removing the electromagnet).
smoking a high sulphur cigar. Ducking
behind a wall. he broke through the glass in
the window and called out: “We know you're
in there. Minnow! Come outwith your hands
up! But first turn out the lights and make
sure the air conditioner is off!“

“In November? of course it is! Although
you couldn‘t tell it from the temperature in
the room! I got art offer from Swanson to see
three tanks as TV dinners. as is!“ Minnow
quippcd and fired a shot. He put on a rubber
glove. reached into a tank and gritbbcd an
electronic eel. and tossed it to Cash. Cash
fiiiiled a policeman and had the eel taken im-

a quit mutterin’

mediater to the nearest POWer Substation.

“Unit One to base!" Cash shouted into his
radio. “WABY” it replied. Embarassed. he
tried again. “Base this is Cash.Suspect Min-
now taking ﬂight down Main Street. Looks
like he's heading for l—43l“

"I‘m sorry. Due to cutbacks of power
usage, all transmissions must be restricted to
this recording.“

Cash ran to a telephone. found a dime in
the coin return and called the office. “You‘d
better send a couple of cars down I-
43...Right. Say. how‘s the wife?...Roger."

The police cars appeared immediately.
Minnow was racing down l-43. heading for
the border. Cash jumped aboard one ofthe
cars as it rolled down the highway. “Step on
it! We can catch him!“ Cash shouted. frang-
ing onto the license plate.

“Don't yoti remember the President's
speech? We aren't allowed to go faster than
50 miles per hour!"

"How did you expect to catch him. then?"

“ They sent two cars. didn't they? That‘s as
good as one car going IOU!"

Just as they spoke. the President's new
orders came through and all use of energy
stopped.

Toward A More
Humane University

by (ilenn Von Nostiir.

Several recent news stories in this paper
fiave shown that a good number of faculty
members and student leaders itrc not at all
pleased \vrth Vice President Philip Sirotkin‘s
performance in office. One of their most
often \tilccd complaints is that Sirotkiii
"practically runs the academic end of the [In-
itcr'sity singlchaiidcdly". that he issues most
of the significant itcadc mic policy directives.
and that University President Louis Bette/ct
Iiiis consequently become a sccortdary figure.

Not only do the critics dislike liiivtng im-
portant policies made by the Academic Vicc-
l’resideiit. but they don't particularly care
for what the policies say. A iiieiiio Sirotkiii
