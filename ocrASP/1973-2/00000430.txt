The Pain/er Sisters-are now one
of the most conversed about
groups today. Just being present at
their Roseland. N.Y.C. debut hasa
sort of “elitist” stigma attached to it
in New York social circles. with
tickets being highly competitive in
obtaining wherever they are to
play. These four girls have made it
to the top with ease. Straight from
the West they have takenthe whole
country by surprise. They took
what many people thought was
only a good gimic (not a new one
people would admit) and Itave
proven their talents.

The many comparisons with a
contemporary of theirs is un-
warrented. for they seem to have
gone Bette Midler one step better.
and they are doing something Miss
M. admits “Ij us' shy away from it.
gosh!" Yes the very art that Ella
l‘it/gerald had perfected
throughout her illustrious career.
llie art ol "scatting" is alive and
well. For those of you who might
be unsure what scatting is. it is
simply the improvisation and ill]-
ling through repetition ol
sometimes absurd. seemingly
meaningless syllables sung to a
melody. Yesthese young ladies are
\vrthout a doubt the best female
vocal group around in quite a Iew
years.

In their first major recording
clfort the album The Pointer
.S'ixri'rr (31548) is an extremely ﬁne
product. David Rubinson and
Friends lncorp. out in the West
did quite a fine job here producing
quite a big artistic and monetary
success. a raare combination at
times in the modern music world.
“Yes We Can Can“asong we have
quickly learned to adore was
released as the single from the
album is the one cut that is so ill-
representative We have to the past.

the band is quite a bit more than
just a back-up. On this cutting the
vocals also are a major instrument
entwined with the guitar. bass
acoustic and electric and the
drums. Ron Me Clure electric and
acoustic bassman uniquely
supplies the bass lines not only with
his guitar but with "Mr. Bassman"
type vocals also. along with the in-
divivualized scatting rendered by
Anita. Ruth. June. and Bonnie.
These are also complemented by
some fine free I'ormjazxdrummirtg
