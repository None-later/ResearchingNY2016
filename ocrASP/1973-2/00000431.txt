It was a cold windy autumn
Saturday afternoon, a perfect day
to stay indoors and study. but for
the Albany State football team it
was another chance to beat
Plattsburgh State.

Plattsburgh had beaten Albany
in till three previous meetings, in-
cluding lirst year‘s final ga me which
prevented the Danes from having
an undefeated season. But it wasu
different story Saturday as Albany.
aided by a strong wind and a tough
defense. broke thejinx with uneasy
52-0 victory over the Cardinals.

Ask any soccer coach. and hc

and that it is also the most im-

halfbacks arc responsible for
Ihc 60 yards around lhc mid-
hcld area. and must play
ollcnsc. defense, and ball con—
trol. Generally, the ccntcr haIl~

defensive struggle as neither team
could mount much offense.
l’Itittshurgh got the game'sﬁrst big
break when they recovered an
Albany tumble on the Danes 26.
The Cardinals marched down to
thcthrcc but the Danes hcld whena
fourth down pass was incomplete.
That was to he the closest
l’lultsburgh would get.

With the qtrartcr coming to it
close. thc Danes started on their
wary to a score. Aided by a rou-
ghing penalty call on it fair catch.
thc Danes started from their own
45. Aftcr Hcrtuui rolled out for
ninc._thc Quarter ended and the

   

Danes now had the strong wind at
their back. Albany was able to use
the wind to their advantage. scor-
ing all four of their touchdowns
when the wind was in Albany‘s
favor. The Danes drove to the 35
and faced ti fourth and four situa-
tioti. Hertuui decided to gamble
and called the ho nib to Bob Baxter.
The pass was a beauty. 35 yards in
thc tllr to thc gottllinc. where Bax-
tcr snarcd it for six.

'I'Itrcc'plays later Albany was on
the move again after a to yard
punt. they then drove to the 26.
This time senior co-captain Bill

   
 

Adams struck out of the line and
was It“ alone as Bertuzzi hit him for
it 22 yard touchdown. For Adams.
noted for the great job he does
blocking. it was a line way to close
out his home ctircer. catching his
first pass of the ycttrtts vtcll its scor-
ing his first touchdown in an Alba-
ny uniform.

again outstanding forcing the Car-

dinals to punt. Five Albany players
stormed in trying to block the punt
and Ken Schcon got his hands on

the ball giving Albany the posses-

sion on the 47. The Danes
engineered a nine play touchdown
drive. capping it when Glen
Swot! ski went up the middle for
six. Before the half ended the
ltrncs tried a 52 yard ﬁeld goal but
the attempt fell way short.

If I’Itittshurgh was going to get
back into the game. they would
