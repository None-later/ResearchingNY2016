It was a crisp Saturday afternoon as he Albany State football
team closed out their home season against Plaiisburgh. The game
proved most interesting as Great Dane quarterback John Bertuzzi
(Number IS above) came out passing and he led Albany to an easy
32-0 victory. The Danes were sparked by a tough defense, helping
the team to its ninth straight home game without a defeat. More
about the game on page l5.
