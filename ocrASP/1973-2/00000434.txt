ed. note: The following letter. sign-
ed by 85 college and university
newspapers, was sent to members
of the House of Representatives on
November I I.

To the Members of Congress:

We. the undersigned 85 college
and university newspapers from 29
states call upon the House of
Representatives to impeach Presi-
dent Richard Nixon.

At a time when popular com-
mentators delight in discussing
nationwide student apathy, Mr.
Nixon‘s repeated abuses of power
have rekindled the outrage of the
late l960‘s. Just as studenTs
mobilized to stop a tragic and im—
moral war. we now commit
oursleves to the removal ofa Presi-
dent who has forsaken rule by law.
We can not stand idly by while

countless revelations of corrup-
tion, illegality, and deceit shatter
the faith of the American people in
their governmental institutions.

On Sunday. October2l, the day
after the firing of Archibald Cox.
the editors of the Amherst Student
drafted an editorial calling for the
impeachment of the President.
While the grounds for indictment
had been apparent for some time.
there had been hesitancy to recom-
mend such an extreme measure.
But Mr. Nixon's decisive and tin-
precedented actions-his rule by flat
and force — permitted no other
recourse.

The Student circulated the
enclosededitorial. a revised version
of the original. to college and tub
newspaper's across the

editorial, along with a list of
signatories. Many papers had
aready called for impeachment
themselves. but there was a need
for a single nationalstatcment of
student sentiment to reinforce and
amplify these individual
statements.

'l‘ogetlrer. the undersigned
newspapers serve a population of
more than one million students.Wc
have a combined circulation of
nearly 700.000. Only limitations of
lime and monetary considerations
have kept this list from being
significantly longer. From Maine
to Washington. from Minnesota to
lcsas, from liberal arts college to
mtiltiiiiriversily, from elite private
institutions to broadly-based state
schools. the message is the same:
Ihc President must be impeached.
lhe campus commitment is un-
iiristakcablc.

llre impeachment of Richard
Nixon i.s prerequisite to the
restoration of confidence in our
system of government. The weeks
ahead could represent either the
redemption of American
democracy or the prologue to its
Collapse. In this time of national
crisis. the Members of Congress
must overcome political timidity
illld put aside partisan con-
siderations, lheir duties under the
Constitution are clear. lliey fail to
act at the nation‘s pci'il.

Very truly yours,

(Signed by Robert Steinbrook.

llie SUNYA library. said to
contain somewhere iii the Vicinity
of one million volumes, came
under question as rumors
.sprcad recently concerning the tin-
checked tlrcli of its books.

l'lic rumors cainc more or less
simultaneously with the mid-
.sciricster research paper rush. the
time when the most amount of
books are nccded at any one time.
Complaints “etc that many oi the
books supposedly otuicd by ilie
library. as evidenced by a card
caialogiic listing of them. are trot
“here the) are supposed to be. nor
have they bccn recorded as being
taken out. l'hrs prompted many
students to assume that they were
.stolcii.

Mr. lidrnond Mcncgaux, Dir-

ector of Circulation. was
questioned concrnr rig ln'c
suspected thicvcry.
When asked hotsiiiany books were
stolen. he responded witlra laugh.
He said. "I don‘t know how many
or \vliai types of books were iniss~
ing because an inventory of
library books has never been
taken." He added that lic did not
think that there \tct‘c as many
books being stolen as people hate
claiiiicd No specific amount of
stolen books was gitcn. lrovscvci,
though he Ielt that reports of thclt
arc exaggerated.

Mcncgatix asserted that people

books correctly. and alien they
can‘t find .r particular book, tlic\
asstiiiic that it has been stolen. V
