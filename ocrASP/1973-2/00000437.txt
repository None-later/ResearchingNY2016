Tricks and Trumps

by Henry Jacobson

The laws of Bridge is a
much neglected area of
study. Most players enjoy a
more sociable game and
therefore don't bother with
all the details involved in
citing a law when an
irregularity has occurred.
Butintournaments or money
games it is important to
protect yourself against
your opponents' possibly in-
advertant but nevertheless
illegal actions. So here are
justafewlaws which crop up
quite frequently.

1) A card is deemed to have
been "played" when any of
the following conditions
apply:

(a) ll declarer holds a card
face up. touching or near the
table.

(b) 11' declarer teaches and
touches a card in dummy and
it is explicitly obvious that
he intends to play that card.
The exception is when
dcclarer arranges the cards.

(c) A defender‘s card must
be played if it is held so that
hls partner can see its lace.

((1)1iisu. penalty card (to be
discussed later).

2) Calling of cards from
dummy:

(:1) 11' declarer. in followmg
suit. calls "high" when sum-
moning a card from dummy.
he can be forced to play the
highest card of the suit in-
dicated: the reverse applies
with "low."

1b) 11 declai'cr names a Suit
but does not state the rank.
the play of the lowest card of
the suit called is assumed to
have been designated.

(c) if declui'ci‘ names a card
which is not in dummy. the
call is retracted and u propcr
call is substituted.

Music

3) Either defender or declarer
may demand an inspection of
the previous trick until a
member of his side has
played to the subsequent
trick.

4) Any spectator (ki-bitzer)
should maintain absolute
silence throughout the play
of the hand and should not
make any comment concer-
ning a play or bid. His
manner or gestures should
be repressed until the con-
clusion of the play; nor
should he call attention to
any irregularity or error in
the play. He should also
refrain from quoting the
laws and giving unsolicited
information. The director of
the tournament IS the only
one authorized to give
rulings.

5) thn udclcndcr mach :in
opening lead out of turn:

(a) lleclurcr can accept the
lUild. In this case dummy‘s
hund is spread and (lcclnrcr
plays next from his own
hand. This unusual pluy ol'
curds is in cll'cr'l for 11115 rou-
nd only.

(b) The curd lcd may be
treated as u pcnzilty card as
dictated by (lcclzircr.

(c) llcclnrcr may demand
the true lcndci‘ to loud or
prohibit llllll lrom playing
that sun lor as long :15 the
offender‘s purlncr retains the
load. In this (' .' 2. 1111! illegal-

declarer finds that he needs
all three tricks in this suit.
Usually. if there is no infor-
mation available to obviate

‘tlicdecision.the best procedure
is to flip a coin.thenfinesse
accordingly. This method
usually works 500} of the
time. depending on how
smart your penny is. But
there IS a definite method
which wxll guarantee your
making all three tricks in
that suit. 11 goes like this.

Declarer leads the .lack

turn. decliu'cr agnin notices
