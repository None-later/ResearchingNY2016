[Tonal Games People Play

Jane Carlson. pianist, winner of
the Naumberg Prize, student of
Carl Friedberg and Myra Hess,
and faculty member at the Juilliard
School. will play a work with
which she haslong been familiar. It
is Paul Hindemith‘s major com-
position f or piano: Ludus Twirl/is
(“Tonal Garire"). subtitled Studies
in Counterpoint. Tonal Organiza-
tion. and Piano Playing. This
remarkable piece which contains
fugues and interludes with
aprelude and postludc owes much
to Chopin's preludes and eludes.
and Bach‘s well-tempered Clavier.
and is the major twentieth century
work in this tradition.

During the last years of his life
(d. I963) Ms. Carlson was an
associate of Hindemith. studying
and performing his piano works
under his direction. and her perfor-
mance of Ludus has received world
renown; here are quotes from her
concert and recording
reviews:...ingenious and
fascinating collection...successful
in conveying the shifting
moods...musical understanding of
rare degree...a gorgeous panorama
of power and delicacy...altogether
convincing tour de

force...remarknbly expressive
“character interliidcs“...firm.
brilliant. incisive. and certainly
authoritativc...(recording) the
most satisying of them all...con-
siderable interpretive insight. by
turns bringing out the music‘s
drama. humor. and charin...the
soft radiance of her playingis quite
stunning. In general she has made
this “notorious” Hindemith work a
very musical experience.
