 Pipe-Dream Come True

The heat is on. And with the cold weather this year grows the fear of a severe fuel
shortage; - and the fear becomes an actuality.

Across the nation the cry has gone up for the conservation of power. Lights dim,
thermostats slip, cars slow...

i Congress, in her turn. looks to ways to remedy the problem. Foremost lies the
memory that in the wastelands ofthe Alaskan frontier lie billions of gallons of oil.
There:_ for the taking.

And take it we will. This week the Senatcpassed the Alaskan pipeline bill by an
overwhelming vote. Man will soon be licensed to startripping up yet another corner
ofthe globe. The cry for the conservation ofthe earth is weakening in the stark face
of reality.

 

Many would argue thatthe Alaskan pipelineissue has been carefully researched and
that all care will be taken to minimize destruction ofthe environment. Yet. we have
seen man with his back up against the wall before. l-lisconcern lies not for the future.
In the immediacy of the situation he will snatch wildly for what he canget. He will
lash out blindly to fight the forces that threaten to overwhelm him; those very forces
that he created.

Who will suffer'.’ The land. certainly. But who can concern himself withsuch ii lux-
ury of thought when his very existence is threatened? Who. indeed. will suffer?

On one hand. we are screaming conservation. while with the other we are plotting
destruction. One has to laugh; not with glee. certainly, but with the realization of
irony.

Objection Overruled

The memorandum issued by President Benezet to the University Senate this
Wednesday provides a sad indication of the powerlessness of that body.

After much heated deliberation and debate. a carefully drawn-out Senate resolu-
tion outlining the procedures for tenure reveiw was arbitrarily cast aside by the
President. What sort ofa farce is this Senate? Why should they waste their time if all
their work is for nothing? The problem of tenure and continuing appointments is far
too important an issue for the president to be able to disregard the decisions of
the Senate.

The various councils now have the means whereby they can simply refuse to
recommend any final decision on a controversial tenure case. with the secure
knowledge that their lack of decision alone will providethe basis for the Administra-
tion to refuse to grant tenure.

With the review of the Curt Smith case now imminent, it would be wise to
remember. whatever the vote finally is, that students had very littletosayaboutit.

 

ERRATUM:
in a front page story on Friday. November 9th and in a column on 'I ucsday. November l3th.
it was erroneously reported that the French Department had voted against the promotion

0f PfOfCSWI' Douglas Alexander, Alexander had. in fact. been positively recommendcdu

by a l9-5-9 vote. We apologize to the French Department and to our readers for this error.

History. they say. goes in cycles. The
I920‘s. '40‘s and '60‘s were turbulent. if not
violent decades. while the pace was con-
siderably slower during the I930's. and the
‘50‘s. Pundits have been telling us that the
1970's will follow this pattern. with change
likely to come slow. The election of Richard
Nixon. they say. was the beginning ofthis
slowing down period.

Developments now seem to be proving
otherwise. and this may very well be the
decade ofthe greatest change of all. We are
now facing the culmination of so much of
what has gone on before. We have reached
two very iinportant'climaxcs known respec-
tively as Watcrghﬁfnnd the Energy ('risis:

Viva la France !

To the Editor:

Last Friday. in the ASP.onthe front page.
there appeared under the signature of Glenn
von Nostitz the following statement:

“This satire problem of allegedly ignoring
department votes has been charged by
members ofthe Graduate School of Public
Affaris in the case of Theodore Bayliss.and
by French professors in the promotion case
of Douglas Alexander. In the former case.
the department vote was against Alex-
antler."

Concerning Professor Alexander. nothing
could be further from the truth. Here are the
facts:

On October IS. l97l. the then Depart-
ment of Romance Langiiuges sent the
following resultsofadcpartmcntalvotccon-
ccrning thc promotion of Professor Alex-
zirider to Dean Schmidt - Yes. I9: Abstcn-
tions. 9'. No. 5.

Subsequently. Professor Alexander was
named Charirnan of the newly organi/cd
l-rciich Department for a period of two
years. His reappointment in this capacity
was recently considered by the french
Departman We feel it appropriate at this
time to make publicthc letter sent hy the
l‘tctlcll Department to Dean Schmidt cori-
ccriiing Professor Alexander's reappoint—
merit, The letter was .sigiicd h\ 24 oiri of 25
members of the Ikptirtiricni; and if was
dated September Zflih:

"We. the undersigned. members of tlic

Toword A More

To the Editor:

I wish to comment upon “Higher Educa-
tion“ by MA. Mcltzer. which appeared in
last Tuesday‘s ASP. The author states that
college is “it highly unproductive game." I
agree with iliisauthor‘s sentiments. however.
it enriiges me to read that the guilt for this
situation "rests heavily on the shoulders of
students."

This article is outrageous. What is wrong
with stimulating communication of a
physical nature? l resent anyone who refers
to a beautiful human experience with a sar-
castic tone. How can the author say that
“When most students leave the classroom
the thinking process grinds to halt." l must
assert. that when I leave the classroom I find
more than enough thinking processes going
on among my suitcmittcs and l.

l have come across more than one faculty
member who (it“BS not "try to alleviate this
problem of serious student apathy." flow
can a serious student react wrihiinytliing brit
apathy to it class where the main mark of
crcatitc irilcllcci is iiiciisurcd by how well it
