Jim Shrader became the first
All-American recipient in the
history of Albany State Cross-
Country this past Saturday when
he finished third among 250
runners in the National Collegiate
Division-3 Championship
(NCAA‘s) meet in Wheaton, ll-
linois. His time of 24:38 for the 5-
mile course placed him just 10
seconds behind winner Stet/e
Foster of Ashland (Ohio) College.

For Shrader. it was the highlight

R. Keith Munsey's l2 ycar Albany
State Coaching career, and forthe
runner‘s themselves it is as co-
captain Bill Sorel put it, “A dream
come true. It makes all the hard
work seem very satisfying and
worthwhile now.“

Sorel was one of six strong
runners who competed last Satur-
day for Albany at Wheaton. His
race was not a personal success.

Shrader. meanwhile. was
hobbled by a bone bruise in his heel
which.despitetakingtwo weeks off
from running. still caused sharp
pain. Yet rather than take any
more time off. he decided to run
with the injury. and his presence
proved inspirational.

team who would challenge the best
men from every opposing team.

It not only helped him. it helped
the team. Cherubino says. “He
made it so much easier for me to
run loose .and not worry about
pushing myself. that l beganto run
much better and relaxed races.“
Sorel adds. “ He became someone
to look toevery second. He gave us

You Can’t Win Without Scoring-A73" f

by Nathan Silent I
Last season, after every grueling
game, the first words out of
Coach Wingert‘s mouth were
always. “You can't win ifyou can‘t
score. and for G-d's sake. we can‘t
score. We had some opportunities
which my grandmother could havi
put in the net. and not one of OU
guys could do anything." you were
unfortunate enough to watch
any of last season‘s games. you
know that that was an understate-
ment. The Danes could not score if
their lives depended on it. A whole
24 goals in l4 games. includingthe

   

Martinel and Petriccione showed
on August 26. 'Ihe next stop was
New York City. whereJosc Ruano
was added to the list of All New
York City players who would be
surprising Albany in the near
future. As for (‘lifl Waller. he is
one of the ten veterans of last
season‘s team. Supplemented by
the likes of Paul Schich and Leon
Sedeftan. they have proven their
ability With their constant assaults
on enemy ttcts.

As for Pascuali Petriccione, he is
the exact opposite of the relatively
unknown Martinez. but the two
are a deadly duo on the field. con—

fine games forlheDanes. but. like

knotting the score when he hit the

As for Jose "Chipie" Runao. he
is probably the best offensive

 

against them. and his goal and 3
assists which led the Danes to a
com: from behind victory and a
lock on the NCAA bid. Despite a
broken wrist suffered in the Un-

Fullback; halfbacks, forwards,

and a good fcoach are all integral
and important part of the game.

tion. as are the quality

utilitymen needed to give the
