Gridders Face RPI
In Season’s Finale

by Harvey Kojan

The l973 Great Danes foot-
ball season. a season marked
for the most part by growth and
optimism, comes to a conclu-
sion this weekend as Albany
takes on “cross—town rival"
R.P.l. for the first time ever.

The Danes will be coming off
successive shutouts which have
upped their record to 6-2. while
the linginccrs have but one vic-
tory to their credit. However.
the l(.f’.l. record is not that
significant in relation to
Albany. sincc the schedule tltcy
play is far more difficult. for
example, four of the learns they
facc this year are irtrikcd in the
top It) for tire lambcr't Cup (the
honor bestowed on the top
l1istci'n Small College every
year) lhere is no comparison.
and ('oach f‘ord is the first to
agree. bctwccn Alfred,
Middlcbury (with tfic longest
winning str'cak in tlic nation),
('oasitjuardaridllobart—soriic
of tlic names on the Iiiiginccr's
schedule-andStony brook,
Sicria. R.l. l .. etc.

As far as specifics go. the
f{.l’.l. offense has had some
problems throughout the year.
but have shown signs ofgaining
sonic consistency. at least with
tlicii passirtg attack. This has
occurred as a result of the play
of Kim Carrara, the freshman

quarterback who has turned
out to be not only a good
runner, but a more-than-
adcquate thrower.

He is helped considerably by
an excellent collection of
receivers. headed by end Pete
Kettering. who was named “all-
east" this past week for his per-
formance in the St. lawrcnce
game. In that contest he caught
scvcn passes for over [00 yards.
ii Icat which no other reccitci‘
ihc Danes hate faced this
scason has coitic closc to.

lhc linginccr running game
has iicycr ically gotten a full
head of steam due to the simple
fact that tltcy do not possess
arty exceptionally quick bucks
(for thc outsidc runs), nor do
thcy hayc any big, bruising
hacks (for tfic insidc runs).
When a team has trouble both
to tfic outside and inside. it
usually means they tircri't going
to bc depending on tfic running
giiiric to any cxtcnt, which
should be interesting. since
most of tlic learns the Danes
liavc pltiycd have been ground
oricntcd. One exception was
Sicna. who had a very highly
rated quarterback, but tfic
qtiafity of the Indian ballclub
precludes any comparison with
it varsity squad like It.l’.l.

l'hc linginccr‘s strength lies
in their defense, which has been
consistent throughout the year.

 

In fact, Bob Ford calls the
R.l’.l. defensive line “maybe
the best front five we‘ve seen all
year.“ Whether they cart stop
the outside running game
remains to be seen.

howcycr the Danes
rushing may not be as effective
as usual. especially up the mid—
dlc. Fullbacks John Cage and
lorniriy DcBlois are botft iri—
