Anyone who believes that
apathy is running rampant through
Albany State better take a second
look. specifically at the Protect
Your Environment (P.Y.E.)
organization. Now in its fifth year
at SUNYA, P.Y.E. is going strong
and still growing. Presently the
organimtion has approximately
eighty active members working in
various committees.

Vice president Tom
Moyer outlined the goals of P.Y.E.
by stating the “First concern is the
school and the community.“
Among the major interests of the
group is the recycling of materials
around the university. According
to Moyer. the recycling committee
(coordinated by Lynne Jackson)
probably contains the most
members. This doesn‘t mean
however that their efforts are trott-
ble free. It seems that the janitors
are not totally cooperative in sav—
ing paper the way PYE has urged
them to do. Hopefully though. it
won‘t be long before thejanitors
and PYE members reach asatisfac-
tory accord.

Other projects that have been
planned and should begin any day
include the formation ofaeompost
heap across the street from the
Fuller Road side of themain cam-
pus. The idea of the compost heap
is to gather a couple truck loads
[up or organic wastes frotn
the SUNYA cafeterias rind
transform them into fertililer.
Moyer explained that this is only a
pilot project and it has yet at be
determined whether this will
become an annual event.

Unfortunately. there have been
complaints speculating that the
compost heap will attract rats and
basically create unsanitary con-
ditions. Because the wastes are
covered throughly' with dirt. it is
doubtful whether such conditions
will ever occur.

If this particular project does
prove to be successful its purpose
will be twofold. To begin with.thc
collection of organic wastes wrll
prove useful iii recycling what nor-
niafly would find it its way to tire
garbage. Secondly. the many trees
and bushes around the campus will
be appreciative of the rich fertilizer
(theoretically cyttitig dowti on titt—
iversity expenses).

A committee of particular
relevancy these days is the Energy
(‘ommission of l’.Y 1.. headed by
president Ann l)i/rird. Currently.
as one ttiiglit expect. the members
of this committee are concerned
with Nixon‘s energy policy par-
ticularly in relation to the energy
crises. Dilard stated the basic
policy of P.Y.li. by t‘eiiuirkingthat
“We support the short terrti
tricasriresolf’ered by Nixon." This

includes the lowering of speed
litriiis oti American highways. the
lowering of thermostats (which iti-

 

cidcntly the Albany l‘nitetsity
Council has proposed for SllNYA
buildings). ilrc ltiniiiittiin of tiri-
necessary lighting wheneiui posstr
hlc and the triiplerticiitiition of year

which I’ Y l'. strongly drsrrpptovcs
of are according to lh/artf. "l he

of air admission standards (for car
and factory). the rise of hiin stil-
phirr oils and the building of the
Alaskan pipelitie."' When risked
where energy would coiric frotii if
these Nixon measures weren‘t sup-
trotted. l)i/ard replied that she is

hopeful that tlte efforts of energy
research will be able to find new
sources of power. Dizard and
Mayer expressed confidence in the
prospects of solar energy in par-
ticular. Moyer continued by ex-
pressing his opinion him “We
(Americans ) have always been
gluttons" therefore the energy
crisis is useful in that it is a “Good
awakening for Americans. it
really hits them where it counts."

Many of P.Y.E.'s efforts are
directed at informing and educa‘
tion the public about environmen-
tal issues. Prior to this yea r's elec-
tion there was a committee aimed
specifically at "advocating the
demise of the transportation bond
issue." Because of the committee's
successful efforts. further study
ol'trtinsportation issues is in the
planning. The "Student Speaking
Group“ committee. headed by
l-lowie Sharfstein. is designed to
spur environmental interest and
awarenessintothe grammar sclioof
students ofthe Albany area. Other
educational and awareness efforts
tliw P.Y.E. is responsible for par—
ticularly at SUNYA include the
“Campus Center Exhibits"
organized hv Kathy Eastman and
the environmental announcements
on radio station WSUA coor-
dinated by Howie Sharf‘stcin.

Like any other active group.
P.Y.E. is responsible for a budget
which it is always seeking to keep-
halanced. Fran Schulberg.

that “Making things out of
recycled material won‘t cost us
much." and in addition. the public
will be made aware of how useful
articles cati be made lrotii things
around the ttousc.

Despite the relative success of
triatiy I’. Y. li. projects. the
organi/ation could always use
more help. Vice president Moycr
expressed his hope that the group
wtll continue to expand for ttr his
words. “ I he more people we have.
the more we can do." P.Y.li. is
always opcti to suggestions and

Existing programs ofcollege stu-
dent aid liave become so
"fragmented" that the system “has
lost touch“ with the needs of the
students it is intended to serve.
This was the conclusion of a
preliminary report on Student
Financial Assistance. prepared by
the New York State Senate Com-
mittee on Higher Education.

According to the report. “the
proliferation of aid programs lack-
itig central administration caused
the committee to study and
evaluate the total array of student
financial aid available to New York
residents."

The comprehensive report calls
for the establishment of a Higher
Education Services Corporation to
consolidate the administration of
all existing systems of student aid.
Such a corporation wotild be able
to eliminate inequities. excessive
iidiiiinisirative costs. duplicate
applications. and delays in
payments.

The report was endorsed by the
committee‘s chairman. Senator
Ronald ll. Stafford. and Senate
Majority leader Warren M.
Anderson. who tirade the report

alerted to the problems iii aid dis-
tribution in his own district where

system and at the satire time lower

The report itself was a detailed
study of existing programs, their
shortcomings and possible
solutions.

According to the committee‘s
findings. New York State directly
supports sixteen separate aid
programs. including scholarships.
grants. arid loans. Detailing each
program. the report noted that “as
a result of the diversity of program
objectives. public funds are dis—
hrirsed iii a variety of ways“ in»
yo differing criteria of
eligibility. In addition. tron-state
governments, private busiiic ‘
arid foundations. rind other agcn-

Surgeon» Tries To Forget

DALLAS (AID- Dr. Malcolm 0.
Perry. the surgeon who‘tried to
save President John F. Kennedy l0
years ago. wishes now he could
reclaim a few words he spoke
shortly rifter Kennedy died.

"I was pretty naive." Perry said
recently of his statement about the
tieek birllet wound at a tumultuous
press conference at Parkland
Hospital. His words have led to
endle 'peculation about ltow the
President was killed and whether
there was more than one assassin.

“Did yoti say entrance wound?“

“Yes. entrance wound.“ l)r.
Perry said.

This latter statement appeared

to be. atirl has led to suspicions
