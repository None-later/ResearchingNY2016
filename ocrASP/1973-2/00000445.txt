you could name. the problem of
buying street drugs is thatyou just
don't know what you‘re getting.

Three ofthe most common rip-
offs are mescaline, THC and
cocaine. Often. drugs sold under
these names are not those drugs at
all.

THC. or tetrahydrocannibanol.
the active ingredient of marijuana.
is the most consistent rip-off.
While amounts of THC can be
successfully extracted from mari-
juana and hashish, it tends to
deteriorate in only two to four
hours. making street sale of THC
almost a physical impossibility.
Alleged THC is usually phen-
cyclidine. known as PCP. Scr-
nylan. or Angel Dust. lts actual
medical function is a veterinary
anesthetic. Low doses of l’Cl’

i

produce sedation and general
numbness. but high doses cart
produce convulsive seizures.

A further danger of PCP is that
when chlorpromitzine. ti common
drug administered to LSD over-
dose paticnts. is administered to a
person who has taken PCP. the
result can be respiratory arrest if
enough PCP has been taken. Un-
fortunately, PCP is very often
combined with LSD in make
“mcscaline”.

Mescaline sold on the street is
only rarely true mescaline. largely
dtie to simple economics. Adose of
LSD is much smaller than a dose of
mescaline. and much more readily
available. Add to this the fact that
the effects of a weak dose of acid
are very similar to those of a dose
of mescaline. and you have the
both compelling and widespread
logic that selling weak LSD as
nicsailiiie is a smart thing to do.

ironically. the reason the de—
mand for mcsealine is so high is
that many people a ho want to use
hallucinogetis don‘t trust LSl)
becatisc it is a synthetic drttg. and
because of traditional lore concer-
iiitig chromosome datnagc. .t\n
"orginic" iticscalinc trip sounds
like the answer to built problems.

()ltcn. mcscalinc contains l’(’|’
as \\cll as acid. leading to the mer-
dues dangers already described,
Do It Now. a drttg information
foundation based in Phoenix. has
released some simple guidelines for
determining if mescaline is really
mescalinc.

l’irst. st/e is a factor. li'ttc

mesetilinc sulltitc requires a hall-
gnim dose lora trip. lhisisa cori-
siderableiiniount ol powder. and it

only a large capsule is capable oI

Second. the nature of nicscaline
sulfate is such that it cannot be
compressed into a tablet without a
argc amount of binding agent. so
nittch that a tab of mescaline \toitld
be so large as in lime to be broken
into pieces to be syyiilloued corti-
forta bly.

l'ittally. the
niescalinc is dii'lerent in the early

reaction in

stages. causing nausea and
y oiiiitiiig lollooed by the trip. With
LSI) there is usually nota sick lee].-
tng. So. it you don't feel sick fora
\shile. you're almost certainly not
doing real mescaliite.

Is The Energy Crisis Real?

NEW YORK (AP) -Thc question
no longer is whether or not there is
an energy shortage. There is. The
controversy now. at least among
concerns otir reaction

   

cconomi s.
to the shortage,

l‘he answer is a critical one
because the assumption made dic—
tates the action advocated. It is
here that the pros. who generally
agree that the country will soon be
llirting with recession. go their
separate ways.

Walter llellcr. former Kennedy
administration economic adviser
and now a University of Minnesota
prolessor. disagrees with Treasury
Secretary (ieorge l’. Sclitiltl. who
belicycs the public is over-reacting.
