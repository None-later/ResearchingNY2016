Binghamton Bursts Boaters" Bubble

by Nathan Snlnnt
“Disappointed. Yes. Discourag-
ed, no.“ That was Coach Bill
Schieffelin's reaction the day after
his booters were eliminated from
the NCAA Tournament by visiting
Binghti mton. Tlte game itself wasa
2-l. double overtime marathon.
and very reminiscent of the ﬁrst
meeting between these two clubs.
The difference. however, was the
outcome. lite Danes played their
hearts out. but they just did not
click the way they had all season. In

 

   

fact. it was actually one of their
poorer showings. but that is what
tournament tension and pressure
are all about.

lt was quite a game. and do not
let anyone tell you any different.
Over 2.000 fans braved the freezing
temperatures. biting winds. and
continuous snow. and they all got
their money's worth. Both goalies
put on exceptional performances.
especially Albany‘s Henry Obwald
who was super in the nets. Defense
and missed opportunities were the

Although only l—il going into the

order of the day. and the style of
play.

At times. the game resembled a
hockey game. especially during
those frequent periods of time in
which one team would dominate
play. while the other tried
desperately to clear the ball.

The ga nie itself wasa true battle
between evenly matched teams.
and opened with Binghamton
dominating play. After about ten
minutes of allowing the visitors to
bang away at the Albany net. the
Danes got it together arid reversed
the play. Ten minutes of Dane
Domination followed. but the
home teanr failed to score. Soon.
play became first and furious. with
excellent end-to—end actioti.

Minutes later. l.iiicwea\cr came in
on it breakaway. and ()bwald
stopped ltirii this time. Several
Dane drives were also falling short.
as (ioldstein kept the llinghamton
door shut.

End-to-end action continued.
until with just 3 minutes left iii the
half, lcroy Aldrick was fouled at
the 30-yard mark. llte resultant
direct kick was booted around in
front of the net. popped tip in the
air. and was headed into the goal
by Schlegel. l'lie erotvd went wild.

Danes came out smoking. but were
cooled off by Goldstein. The tide
reversed itself. and Bingha‘mton
began a five-minute pounding of
the Dane net. A lull in the action
followed. and then both teams
began to play sloppy soccer. failing
to complete passes or look for the
open man.

The first overtime period saw
both teams come close. but fail to
