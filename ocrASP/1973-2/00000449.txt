The circus has come and gone in
Cortland, and so has a tidy sum of
allegedly stolen funds. Hubert
Dickey,a Cortland College student
and former co-ordinator of a com-
mittee which sponsoredl the Cor-
tland appearance ofthe Hanneford
Circus. has been charged with
grand larceny in the third degree.

Dickey has been charged with
the theft 6r $300 from Cortland
College‘s Circulating Fund Circus
checking account, and the case has
been bound over to the grandjury.

Dickey was in the custody of
Cortland‘s County Sheriff for
several days. Bail bond has been set
at$5000 and cash bond at $2500. A
campus fund drive was undertaken
to raise bail money for Dickey‘s
defense.

Dickey ’s Disappearing Act

neitve'en July rpm 20 of this year.
Dickey deposited $2,525.95 in the
Circulating Fund account. The
Cortland student government has
since received copies of IS checks
which Dickey allegedly cashed
from the account since late July.
The sum of the largest check is
$300.

In early October, Dickey was
scheduled to appear before the C ir-
culating Fund committee to detail
what he knew of money found mis-
sing from the committee‘saccount.

He never got to explain anything
to the committee. An hour before
the scheduled meeting. Cortland
Director of Campus Security
arrested Dickey at the urging of
Larry Summers. student govern-
ment president.

Asked by a Cortland newspaper
reporter if he could live with the

Summers remarked. “l in."

Two days'before the scheduled
committee meeting, a college vice-
president informed Summers of
discrepancies in the Circulating
Fund account. The following day,
Summers contacted Glen Mauncy,
a member of the college union ad-
ministrative staff. who is partially
responsible for paying bills conse—
quent to the appearance of the
Hanneford Circus.

with Summers then. saying his full

Summers didn't like that. The

put out the word on Dickey.

Dickey was arraigned for grand
larceny at about the time he had
been scheduled to speak before the
committee.
