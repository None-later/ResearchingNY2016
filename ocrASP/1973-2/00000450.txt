Miss Woods Testifies

Dy III", F. Rout-I

Alsoehled Pres Writer

WASHINGTON AP - President Nixon’s personal secretary. Rose Mary
Woods, testiﬁed today that she had listened only to one part of a
Watergate-related tape recording that the White House says is missing an
18-minute segme’nL I

During Miss Woods' testimony. US. District Judge John J. Sirica said
that subpoenaed White House tape recordings were to be turned over to
him later in the day. 'He gave no’details of the transfer of ,the controversial
tapes, tong sought by federal prosecutors.

Miss Woods testiﬁed that she transcribed the taped portion of a June 20
I972 conversation that the President had with aide John S. Ehrlichman in
his old Executive Ofﬁce Building’ofﬁce.

The redvhaired segretary said she then also took down a portion when
H.R. Haldeman ﬁrst entered the office and all three men were speaking.
She said she listened to the tape only long enough to becenain Ehrlichman
had left the room.

The White House says 18 minutesof Nixon's June 20 conversation with
former chief of staff Haldeman is obliterated by anaudible tone and moon-
versation can be heard.

There were published reports over the weekend that Miss Woods would
testify that she accidentally erased the IB minutes but questioning had not
progressed to that point in a one-hour morning session.

Miss Woods testiﬁed that last week she twice listened toad uplicateofthc
June 20 tape and said “we listened to what has been called a It. ofother
names - a mistake."

She offered to explain but was interrupted by Watergate prosecution
force lawyer Jill Volner. who was attempting to establish what portions of
the tape"Miss Woods had listened to.

Miss Woods, who has been President Nixon's personal secretary for 23
years. was warned of her constitutional rights to remain silent and to con-
sult with her lawyeras thequestioning began. It was only thesecond time in
the federal court tapes hearings-which resumed today after a two-week
recess-that a witness was so warned. The other witness was Haldeman.

Miss Woods said that she was under the impression that theHaldemanr
portion of the June 20 conversation was not included in the prosecutor‘s
subpoena for nine Watergate tapes. The White House has said that two of
the nine tapes do not exist. a disclosure that ltxl to the hearing in Sirica's
courtroom.

Miss Woods repeated testimonyshe gave pn Nov. 8 that on Sept. 29 at
Camp David. Md..she was given eight tapes to transcribe. The first ofthcse
was the June 20 meeting.

But she said that when she got to Camp David, Alexander M. Haig Jr.
phoned her to say that she was not to type the Haldeman portion of the
June 20 tape. Haig is now Nixon's chief of staff.

“ltookthe message from Gen. Hriigand I thought. thank heavens. [don't
have to type the rest of it." she said.

“When ltestified in court on Nov.8 lwas still under the impression that
the llaldemztn portion of the conversation wasnotsubpocnacd."she said.

She said the President was in her cabin for 5 to 10 minutes on Sept. 2‘)
when she complained about how difficult it was to hear conversations
accurately

Miss Woods testified that thc President listened for about Il\'L‘ or ten
niinutcsund said. 'ldon't scchow you're-gettingunything.‘... He mentioned

Askcd whether she listened to the portion irr\olving llaldernan and the

“‘l did listen to the first part of ll so lcould be sure John lzhrlichmtin was
gone from the room, I listened only until they talked about something in.

At that point White rlousc lawyer Iconrird (inrmct to.de fortibcnch

NSA Pushes For Student Union

by Philip Sen-s

If the leaders of the National
Student Association have their
way. college administrators will
soon be bargaining not only with
unions of janitors. secretaries, and
professors but also with unions of
students.

For the the third straight year.
talk ofcreating a national student
union was adominant theme at the
association‘s annual National Stu-
dent Congress.

Delegates passed a resolution
declaring unionization of students
to bea top priority and establishing
a three member task force "to in-
vestigate and work towards the un-
ionization that express interest in
unionization."

The resolution also declared that

N.S.A. would “be the national
collective bargaining agent on
campuses subject to the approval
of each individual campus.“
As a first step. the association's
new president. Larry Friedman of
Queens College in New York City.
said he wanted to prepare “model
‘contracts' between students and
their schools" to help students
prepare to “cope with the realities
of faculty unions.“

The students had at least two
goals for creating a union:

- - Resuscitating the moribund
national student movement.

- - Meeting the challenge of
faculty collective bargaining.
which student leridcrs fear will
leave them out in the cold.

The students generally agreed
that the national student move-
ment that dominated the l9t’ili‘s
was dcttd. “We an: herein Mizirni
llcrich for the luncrrrloftlic student
movement." said Ron lihrcnrcicli.
the outgoing \‘S A Vice-
President.

Alan Shark.chairman ofthe stu-

dent senate at the City University,
said the union's suggestion that
students organize and bargain
separately really means that they
want students to bargain over dor-
mitory rules and student ' services
and let the faculty take care of
promotion. tenure. curriculus, and
class size.
He suggested that a student union
could negotiate over such things as
student evaluation of faculty
members, grievance procedures for
students treated unfairly by
professors or administrators.
grading policies. class size, and
academic freedom. “There is
nothing in faculty collective
bargaining that involves protecting
students." Shark said. “Faculty
unioniration is to protectfaculty
rights?

The way to counter that. he and
others argue. is for students to
form their own unions. While most
of the students supported the idea
of studcn unionization. many
questioned whether N.S.A. is the
hcstorguniraiion forcrcutingri un-
ion.

In the iiix years since it stopped
taking money from the Central ln-
telligence Agency. N.S.A. has had
to devote much ofi is energy to sim-
ple ﬁnancial survival. In the years
immediately after its C.l.A. ties
were revealed. N.S.A.‘s deficits
grew to half a million dollars.

Over the last few years N.S.A.
has reduced that debt to the point
where it is now down to 325.000,
livcn so. N.S.A. endured tinothcr
linrincuil crises this ycttr. mainly
because it did not get the support
frorn privtttc foundations [but it
lirid received in the post.

Outgoing president 'lini Higgins
suggested that the Association‘s
firitinciril rcsottrccs would really
only rillow it to curry on its most
basic programs. such as provrding
