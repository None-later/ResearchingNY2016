I Governor Rockefeller, amid the glory of his Albany monuments, took the occa-
sion last I Wednesday to commemorate the25th anniversary of the State University
system. Chancellor Ernest Boyer was in attendance, as beﬁts a monarch of such a
splendid creation. ‘

. What moreiinproductivelway is there to honor the twenty ﬁve years of SUNY ex-
istence _than to collect a group of back politicians andlstarched trustees to con-
gratulate themselves on the wondrous deeds they are lparty to? Is there a less ﬁtting
tribute to the students and faculty of the SUNY system than for these men to con—
gregate as Rockefeller honors himself and his stuffed shirt colleagues surrounded by
this, his most prized pyramid?

' Governor Rockefeller has oft times declared that he has built more than anyone in
history since the Pharoahs. Then it is ﬁtting that such a glittering event should occur
within the shadow of what has become to be sarcastically known as Rocky‘s
Tombstone Plaza. That both this university and the South Mall are little more than
mausoleums on Rocky‘s way toward the Presidency has already been wider
accepted. What an honor it is to be an architectural effigy foranegotistical governor
with pathetic delusion of power?

Whatever the cost that SUNY Central wasted on this ostentatious extravagan/a.
there can be no doubt that it could have been far better spent on the introduction ofa
new series of scholarships for students. The 25th anniversary of SUNY should have

been used for something constructive. not merely asa staged show. What better way
to strive toward anew era in higher education than I'ori'. the governor to initiate new

ﬁnancial aids on the occasion. The cost oI‘iicolIege education has risen consistently
along with the cost of simply existing in this state. and we cannot bring ourselves to
believe that the pompous politicians that polluted our halls last Wednesday.aftcrall
the students had been safer sent home for thanksgiving. needed that handout lunch
more than students need that elusive scholarship.

If nothing so altruiin ' as new money tort scholarships could be the outcome of
such an occasion. thcnat least the money could have been much more wisely spent re—
opening some of thos ' associate professorship lines which have been squeeyed out
by penny pinching administrators who tint -and again display their callous disregard
for the true interests of an instutute of higher learning.

Mutual back-slapping never solved any problem. and one that so directly affects
students - and in fact. all New York State residents who passively sat back while
Rocky built himself his own memorial - is only complicated when self-important
businessmen convene for. kudos. We have yet toscc the garish luncheon (with an ap-
propriater expensive wine to calm the thirst) that got a student through school.

A Question Of Rhetoric ‘

To the Editor:

I list these few brief pointsin an attempt to
defend my position in “Higher Education“
(ASP. Nov. l3) as attacked his letterby Ms.
Marleen Barr (ASP. Nov. lo):

(I) Ms. Barr asks rhetorically. “What is
wrong with stimulating communication ofa
physical nature?" I never once in thatarticle
implied that anything was wrong or im-
proper with such communication. I admit
not being able to survive physically or
errrotionally without it. My point wasthatas
the primary means ofcomunicationata un-
iycrsity it is just plainly inadequate.

(2) Again in a rhetorical question. Ms.
Barr asks. “Howoften do professors concen~
tune on triviality instead of intellectual
growth?“ I welcome this opportunity toask ii
lc\\ ol my own rhetorical questions. Are the
