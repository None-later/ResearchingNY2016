Butterfield And

by Bob Ricd'nger

Paul littterficld must have been
in an optimistic frame of mind
when he dropped the old “Blues
Band” title for his current group‘s
“Better Days" moniker. After
releasing several loose and disap-
pointing albums that are best
forgotten. Butterfteld managed to
pull himself together again. This
process ofgetting back in shape led
to a strong album appropriater
titled Belle! (My; featuring his
group of the same name.

II All Comes Back (Bearsville
BR 2l70) is Butterlield's second
outing with his Better Days group.
Unfortunately, the question arises
of whether the group is still seeing
better days. or if the state of the
Union is taking its toll on their
nrusic.

Technically. the sourtd of the
music is better than ever. The band
is probably the tightest one Butter-
Ireld has puttogether. Butter'field's
blues harmonica is approaching
tltc rawness of his earlier albums.

should go to Ronnie Barron Who
wrote the song and who put out a
mighty good vowl.

One part of the album got some
good material but not enough to
put it on the top. “Louisiana

cut on the album. It opens with a
simple yet seductive rhythm that

change or variation until the fade-

this before. Translated the song
scents to say. “You are getting
