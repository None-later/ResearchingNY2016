For coach Bob Ford and his»
football team. I973 was an in-
teresting beginning for varsity
football here at Albany State. It
was a year of continued success and
ittiprovernerit with tlte Daitesto tal-
ly dominating tlteir tltrce club
rivals. Albany firtislted with a very
respectable 7-2 record.

Perhaps Albany wris too
successful. The Danes were caiigltt

too easy. liour years ago. nobody

with three open dates. btit tltcre is

Ford is not sure where the foot-

l'his will probably happen when
Albany meets teams like ltltaca

Alleged Danes Discrimination

by Bill Heller

This is the first part of a two
part series. In my three yearsof
covering the Great Danes. l
have heard and seen a lot of in—
teresting things concerning
racism rtt Albany. My goal in
writing this is to enlighten peo-
ple. biit most importantly to get
the facts otrt and the myths
buried. the series will be
limited to football and brisket-
ball. the two sports I regularly
cover.although I regret ldidn‘t
ltavc the lime to extend it.

Baseball was supposed to be in-
cluded but Coach Burlingame
is away on sabatical.

What is racism in sports?
l'he term itself involves many
aspects especially when applied
to the world of tire athlete.

Ractsrtt cart be stackirtg
Blacks rttccrttrin positions. out—
right discrirttinatioti. a quota
systctii. or playing wltitcs solely
to appease white dominated
audiences. Racism can also be
an excuse. and notlting tnore v
an excuse for not playing. not
making a team or not perfor-
ming well.

Although sports at Albany
are small college. they often
mirror situations in the
professional leagues. Because
of that. comparisons to the big
leagues rtre pertinent and may
throw added insight to the

world of SUNYA.

llte rtiost intelligent rcrttark I
ever read about sports was by
Howard (‘osell iii a I’Iur'lto't'
interview. (‘osell said that
sports is a microcosm. a
miniature society in itself. Just
as there is conflict. racism. and
ugly situations iii the outside
world. there are these things in
sport. As long as there is
human competition irt sports.
there will be human problems.

   
   

“He’ll never get
tired. He’s a
Supernigger.”

familiar with the idea of stack-
irtg in football. I never really
thought about its irttplicatiorts
until I irttcryrewed ('ar‘vin

Administration spokesman Ted

be no ofﬁcial comment on thecase
by the administration. since “The

he acknowledged that. “the Un-

emphasi/ed that he couldn't speak

the President should not get in-
