A delay in the granting of tenure
to six professors at the State Un-
iversity College at Plattsburgh
h'ghlightstheopposingopinionsof
SUNY administrators and faculty
manbers on the issue of tenure
quotas

The controversy began on June
6. I973 when the faculty members
were notiﬁed by their deans that
Plattshurgh President Geo rge
Angeli had notrecommended them
for tenure. The President explain-
ed that by recommending the six
for tenure he would be increasing
the proportion of tenured faculty
in their departments to 75 percent.
Before doing this he wanted the
two departments involved to
dwelop written plans that would
establish the departments‘ long-
range ability to adapt to changing
educational needs. Angell feared
that departments with high percen-
tages of tenured faculty would
possess limited future ﬂexibility.

The six professors argued that
they had been denied tenure for

Hamburgthme Claim Owns

bitrarily had i mposed‘ a
departmental tenure quota which'
he refused to exceed without ade-
quate justiﬁcation.

The faculty members ﬁled a
grievance with the local chapter of
the United University Professors
(formerly Senate Professiona
Association. formerly SUNY Un-
ited). The grievance advanced to
the second level. which involved
review by SUNY Central. before
President Angell decided to grant
the teachers tenure on the basis of
the newly-developed long-range
plans produced by the
departments.

Since Angell‘s decision, all of
Plattsburgh‘s departments have
had to write plans outlining how
they will maintain ﬂexibility by
offering programs that will meet
changing student needs.

The Plattsburgh administration
argues that these plans do not
attempt to impose it tenure quota
on individual departments.
Plattshurgh Vice President for
Academic Afﬁiirs Joseph Burke of-
ficially disavows all systems of

 

one reason: President Angell ar- tenure quotas and ratios. He

echoes administrators throughout,
the state system by emphasizing
department-level planning and by
advocating the ideal of ‘flexibility"
in academic programs.

According to Burke. the most
basic question which every univer-
sity must ask is “what is the ability
ofthe individualdepartment to res—
pond to changes in programs and
staff in the l970‘s'." He feels that
the best way to answer this ques-
tion is for departments to develop
long-range plans similar to the
ones which currently are required
of each of Plattsburgh's 22
departments

Rep rcsentativcs of United Un-
ivcrsity Professions agreed that
these plans do not represent the es-
tablishment of an official tenure
quota system at Plattsburgh.
However. UUP is concerned with
insuring that a department‘s “flex-
ibility‘ does not infringe upon the
right of present faculty membersto
earn tenure l'hc president of the
I’lattshurgh chapter of the UUP.
Herman [)oh. vows to “fight any
specific references in the
departmental plans which litdeth
taiurc quotas." The case ofth: six
faculty members this summer in-
dicatcs that Mr. Bob and other
leaders of United University
Professions are willing to support
their words with action.

the lines are clearly drawn:
regardless of how much SU NY rid-
minist rirtors deny the existence of
tenure quotas. faculty members
and their bargaining agents will
resist any measures which hint at
the imposition of arbitrary quotas
or Ittltos.
