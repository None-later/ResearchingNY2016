property and had been seriously

neglected. It took eight dump
trucks fill] of garbage to clear the
area. There is now a good chance
that it will be put on the National
Register oinstoriail Places. Ms.
Betty Ernst. who owns this pan of
the Bush. runs a horse farm on it.
Her business has just about
rlniibled from the publicity thedig
‘eceived from all three Albany
elcvision stations. Proper care of
the land must now be taken. PYE
hopes to have historical plaques
erected onall thesitesand havethe
Old King's Highway route retrac-
ed.

Reasons for its preservation are
many. It could be a recreational
and open-space area which the
state needs more of. Billions of
gallons of high quality water lie
trapped in the layers of clay and
natural blocks. A reservoir could
be the answer to the community‘s
projected water shortage in the
future. if it is bulldozed and ruined,
the water could become polluted.
’llte l’ine Bush is a natural
laboratory for environmental.
biological. geographical and
historical study
