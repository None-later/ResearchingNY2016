The reputation of War and

a partof poite literary folklore. It
is cveryone‘s standard for the un-
conscionany long novel. andit wa 5
natural for a New York radio sta-
tion to make publicity for itself
during a fund-raising drive some
time ago by broadcasting. non—
stop. the entire text of Tolstoy‘s
tnasterpiece. It seems strange that
alongside this rather uncomfor-
table reputation there should exist
another.that of being the greatest
novel in the world. I must confess
to the helpless banalty of subscrib-
ing to this with as the Russians say.
both hands. though lam aware of
how grudgingly Tolstoy applied
the term “novel” to his work. A
great hater of putting labels on
anything. above all on his own
creation. Tolstoy wrote in a
characteristically Olympian note
that erl'aml Prua' could not be
classiﬁed under any oftheconven-
tional forms. but was rather“What

that is to say. is War ("Ill I't'Ilt't‘.
Well. not to worry lurthcr the
question what it is to be called. let
me statesome ol the reasons for the
book‘s reputation. It is great first
ol al I as a book of characters. For
psychological realism. Tolstoy is
unsurpassed in literature. The
tormented human creatures in
Dostoevsky remain forever in one‘s

portrayed. or rather portray
themselves This is not true of
Natasha. Prince Andrew. Pierre.
Nicholas. Boris. Anatole. Princess
Mary. and the other principal ac-
tors on Tolstoy's stage: they do not
seem to be characters in a book at
all.and areas free from the confines
of print as persons whom We have

ing. we know them a good deal
better than we know our actual ac-
quaintances. for in the case ol'the
latter. wea re sometimes atit loss to
explain why they behave as they
do. htrt no character of War and
I’t’tlt't’ ever baffles the attentive
reader. To be sit re. we may feel like
wringing our hands or throttling
Natash when she commits the
blunder ol‘ her life. leaving l’rincc
Andrew for the scoundrel Anatole
Kuragin. brit \"e are not in the
slightest doubt why she does it.
Indeed. il'wedid not understand all
too well. it would be hard to ac-

(a llrng them. as I Just did. "at:-

paradox that arises from the
always fruitlul comparison with
Dostoevsky. Dostoevsky‘s novels
aregreat tragic drarnasnot only i n
conception and import but in the
quitelitenrl stage technique that he
employed lor the construction of
practically every scene. His novels
are performed. while those of
lolstoy are most emphatically
told. And yet. such is the graphic
prmerol I olstoy‘sstylc that it ishis
characters. not those of
Dostoevsky. whom we remember
as having perceived with that
