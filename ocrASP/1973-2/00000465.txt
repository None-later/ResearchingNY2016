  Ballets .é’é Mims

by Vinny Redn

If this year‘s co-captains have
anything to say about it. the wrestl-
ing team at Albany State should
enjoy one ofits finest seasons ever.
Both tarry Mimsand Doug Bauer
feel that this year‘s squad will
better last season‘s fine 8-3 dual
meet record and possibly get a few
ltighe finishes in their three

'scheduled major tournaments.

Their own individual wrestling
skill and dedication also make
Bauer and Mims key leaders

toward achieving these goals.
Coach Joseph Garcia
strongly supports the team's

choice of captains this year. He
says “They show outstanding
leadership ability. In early season.
due l'omy administrative capacities
(Garcia is SUNYA Athletic Direc-
tor). Mims and Bauer have been
responsible for getting the younger
men acq uttintcd with our program.
and in getting the practices
organi/ed. They would ncy er blovy
tlteirown horns.but theyhiiyc been
an immeasurable aid to the learn ”

Doug Baucrjok ingly shrugs oil
the idea that his role isone ol llll-
portance. “I guess you could tusl
say'l lead the exerciscslttirn time to
tune.” ltc says.

for visiting it igli school athletes."

Bauer's point lolalasa freshman
was the highest on the varsity
teant thttlycar. Last yearhe had an
ll-3 record but felt he wrestled had-
ly. having failed to make an im-
provement. l-lis teammate and
close friend Frank Hemtan

iii a very diffictill tournament over

('oacit (iaretii leels that Doug‘s
weak spot iii the past has been his
balance. since the strength arid
speed were alyyriys there. In prac-
tice this year lie itxls he has seen
delinite trnproyeittent in this area.

\\tt:\llL'l ttt all respects. and has

great concentration. He's the type
you count on for a win in a big
meet." '

Mims is pleased with the quality
on this year's team. “We are better
this year.“ he states. "and we are
going to show just how much we've
iniproved.despile the fact that the
SUNY conference and the New
York Invitational will be much
more competitive this yea r.‘

Both Mims and Bauer are par-
ticularly looking forward to the
meet with the University of
Rochester on February sixth.
Mims says. 'Wc tied them lheyear
before and last year we were
leading lltrough the lower weight
classes and them lost the meet in
the heayter matches by a point or
No. Eyeryonc is looking forward
to that meet this year. especially
since \tc have stronger
heriyyneighrs " And Bauer
ttdds‘We really hope to get up for

\cry rewarding to beat them had-

later. When you wrestle-offthere is
a lolof tension.just astherewillbe
in the later big meets. In the past
we haven't been conditioned
enough for tournaments. This year
we will be,"

About their teammates? Take
Walter Kalz for instance at “8
pounds. Mims: “He did really well
last year as a freshmen. He‘s very
agressive and will be even better
this year.“

Ethan Grossman wrestles at |34.
Bauer. “Hedidn‘l wrestly much in
high school so he was only so-so
last year. but he's much improved
lrom what I've seen in practice.”
And on lom llorn (l5ll). Bauer
says. "He was excellent in practice
btit lte did not commit himself on
the mat enough tnmeels. lie lost a
lew iii the last period last year.
With ti little more aggressiveness
and the added motes he has picked
up. he‘ll be a real asset.“

M tins is also happy about this
year’s Ireshmcn arid he's eager to
help them come along "We how a

Mims points to Dim Mion (190)
and Rudy Vido (heavyweight) as
two veterans who are also
prepared. He feels that if the
match comes down to the last two
matches this year. Albany should
emerge the victor.
