Virginia Governor Linwood
Holton and the entire state higher
education system are being sued in
a sex discrimination action, sup-
ported by the National Education
Association. which conceivably
could open the door for back pay
judgments totaling several hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars.

The class-action suit is being
filed in US. District Court. Rich-
mond. by three former faculty
women: Sarita Schotta and B.
Patricia Dyson. both of Virginia
Polytechnic institute and State
University. Blackshurg. and Ruth
l’alial'erro. Longwood College.

case.“ "This suit," he said “which
challenges the policies and prac-
ticesofztn entire state in the ﬁeld of
higher education. attacks the
whole spectrum of sex discrimina-
tion. The DeShane Fund has sup-
ported women faculty in many
court cases challenging single dis-
criminatory practices. but this cer-
tainly is the most comprehensive
sex discrimination suit of its kind
in which we've been involved.“

The DuShaneFund. established
to protect the human and civil
rights of teachers. is supporting
litigation challenging forced
maternity leave policies. anti-
irepotism rules. and otherpractices
that discriminate against women.

in the suit Dr. laliaferro alleges
that sex discrimination caused her

A new college for prison inmates
is expected to be approved by the
Trustees of the State University of
New York (SUNY). The proposed
college would be the first of itskind
iii the nation. announced SUNY
Chancellor Ernest L. Boyer and
Corrections commissioner Peter

The program will enable both
nten and women inmates to
enroll in full-time study for two-
year associate degrees in liberal
arts and science and Bedford Hills

division of this facility has been
closed for renovation since last

Serious business

"This is an attempt to make
serious the business of
rehabilitation." Dr. Boyer-said,
"The college will have a liberal arts
curriculum because the prison
system already has vocational
programs. The problem is not so
ntuelt to prepare inmates for jobs
as to educate them in the broader
sense arid give them a better self-
image." he continued. He termed
tlte proposal 'a unique wxperiment
~ a correctional facility which also
serves as a separate campus."

“We believe the proposed
programs will make it possible for
rttore prisoners to rrtove back irtto
sxiciety arid lead productive lives."
said Dr. Boyer artd Mr. l’reisner in

conﬁned in the prison. the only

will be screened and then chosen."
a spokesman explained.

Diploma requied

An inmate-student will be re-
quired -to have a high school
diploma or an equivalency cer-
tificate which can be earned
through the prison system‘s
educational program. “Classes for
men and women will be separateat

“with the professors going back
and forth hetWeen the two
facilities."

l’risoners who become students
must have sentences ranging from
at least one year to life. Students
may enroll regardless of the
offense for which they were con-
victed. Pending approval of athc
State Legislature. the additional
costs of running the institution will
be paid by SUNY. and
maintenance will be handled by the
Department of Correctional Ser-
vices.

llte college will be the only
tuition-tree within the SUNY
system. Students will be
guaranteed the right to transfer
their credits to other SUNY
colleges pending their release from
