(CPS) - Under the Constitution
impeachment charges against a
President must be formalized in the
House and tried in the Senate, a
time-consuming process involving
committees. partisanship. power
and politics. Yet in meeting houses
andrschools, in union halls and on
sidewalks across the nation im‘
peachment proceedings against
Pres'dent Riclnrd Nixon have
already begun.

In Wisconsin. a state represen-
tative holds an informalhearingon
whether the legislature should call
for the President's resignation or
impeachment:

71 people registered in favor of
tire proposal. l3 agiinst. In a un-
anirnotis vote the National Board
of Directors ofthe American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) calls for
impeachment and launches a
nationwide petition campaign in
conjunction with Ralph Nader's
Citizen Action group.

Representatives from 35 colleges
met in Amherst. Mass. fortheNew
England College Conference for
lm peachment while 84 student
newspapers ran an editorial
originating with the Amherst Slu-
rlent calling on Congress to im-
peach. l3.000 people turn out for
an impeachment convocation at
the University of California in
Berkeley. hundreds of law students
lobby in Congress to gain
legislators support to impeach
while motorists passing in front of

the White House ‘honk for im-
peachment."

A Denver citizen‘s group rentsa
high school auditorium for an
evening to discuss impeachment.
The AFL-CIO Committee on
Political Education prepares infor-
mation packets for union locals ex-
plaining the national
organiration‘s support for im-
peachment and Citizen's Action
prints 50.000 pamphlets entitled
“Decision for the People,“

Newspapers are filled with
columns. letters. editorials. and
“impeachment poll“ results. Con-
gressional staffs are ﬂooded with
mail and phone calls and ad-
ditional help is added on to deal
with the crush. Everywhere are
petitioners. collecting signature

’iImpeachment Urged On G

The seriousness of the matter
diows itself in the words of those
who seek to impeach and those
.who question why. "Under these
circumstances it is imperative that
the people and their represen-
tatives carefully examine the
issues; the evidence. and theoverall
situation before coming to a deci-
s'on that will reverberate for as
many ymrs as America remainsa
republic." writes Jerry Jackson in
the Emory Wheel. “Such a decision
is to be taken neither lightly nor
heatedly.‘ he cautions.

One ofthefirst lhingsdhose who
teach about impeachment say is
that impeachment itselfis not con-
viction. only the formal presenta-
tion and airing of charges. Many

regard impeachment as a positive
and honorable way to ﬁnd truth
and restore respectability to
govcmment.

‘Pcoplc are scared." said one
Denver woman who said she sup-
ported impeachment because it
would "get things going so people
can believe in their President
again." Rep. Pat Schroeder (I)-
Colo.) said. “Impeachment is the
ultimate means of preserving our
government under law,"

Other find the list of alleged
White House crimes ‘unending"
and say their tolerance has been
stretched too far. Some have a
single goal: stripping Richard Nix-
on of his presidential powers.

Asked what the goals of his
group were.an ACLU spokesman
repl'cd. “First. 2Il$ votes in the
House,‘ The ACLU considers
itself a constitutional lobby. said
the spokesman. and PresidentN ix-
on”hasconsrstentlyand repeatedly
violated the Constitution.“

According to the spokesman the
ACLU stand is unprecedented in
their history. though he claimed
every President has violated the

Constitution in one form or
another. The spokesman described
the list of violations of Con:
stitutional guarantees committed
in the name of the Nixon ad—
ministration as "as long as your
am" and added. "We have never
been so terriﬁed ofan incumbent as
now." '

Though many who work forim-
peachment today are those who
fought against the War a few years
ago. the tactics are different. No

-massive demonstrations of the

kind that brought hundreds of
tltousands to the nations‘s capital
are planned as yet. and no group
has sprung up to coordinate such
an effort.

As a staff member for the
National Student Association
(NSA) said. “We‘re going to wait
for the groundswell to reach
Washington this time." He said im-
peachment groups were concen-
trating on education and explain-
ing the ruisons for impeachment
rather than calling fora specificac‘
tion. The NSA staff member cited
the example of the national
organiration. All-CR) sending
infonnrrtion packets to its locals
but letting arch separate group
take its own stand.

Rep. Paul N. McCloskey .lr. fR-
Calif). at a recent meeting in
Colorado Springs wamed against
sortie of the llCllVIllL‘S that
characterized the anti-war move—
ment. “If those who advocate im-
peachment are also demonstrating
in the streets or waving banners
and committing violations on the
law said McCloskey. “then it is
going to delay public opinion that
will accept impeachment its the
proper course of conduct.“

Nuttisdqr reported that a group
of lawyers commissioned by New
York multi-millionaire Stewart R.
Mott were circulating in
Washington a lSO-pagelist ofwhat
are asserted to be “indictable
crimes“ forwhich the President can
beimpeached . According to oneof
the lawyers. the list does not deal
with constitutionally debatable
issues like the bombing of Cam-
bod in but with “ordinary crimes
like burglary. conspiracy to
defraud the United States. con-
spiriicy to dcprive the people of
