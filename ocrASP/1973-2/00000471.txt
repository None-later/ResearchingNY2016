Sex d iscriminatiori in edttcatiott
v itlia few minor exceptions is now
explicitly illegal. but institutional
non-coiiipliance is reported rain-
punt across the country.
Non-compliance to Title IX of
he Educational Amendments of
I972 has been partially attributed
to the absence of official
guidelines. bttt many clear
\‘io latioris continue to occur, Some
common examples are: i

A woman student's residene}
detemtined by her husband‘s
domicile (while his legal home is
never determined by his wife's) in
order to charge married wotnen
residents out-ol~.statc tuition.
Different housing niles and
hours for men and “omen.
Classes limited to one sex or the
other. or required onl_\ lorone sex.
Quota systems and dillet'ent
standards for admissions and
ﬁnancial aid for ttien arid “omen
Different dress code standards
iticlttditig hair length and pants
restrictions.

ALBANY. NY. (AP) Nelson
Rockefeller's hair is almost white

step is as quick as ever. his mind is
as active as ever. and the ﬁres of
ambition still burn bright. At ()5.

Rockefeller is getting ready forone

Republican conservatives. his own
political stance has changed little,
it at all."'H'c‘s.aguy who goes in for
big ideas. who likes to try different
things.“ said one. “At one point it
was a big effort to rebuild thecities.
at ariotherpoirtt it wasa big push to

And Rockefeller speeches of late
have reflected little that could be
characterired as conservative,

lti September speech to the

that “so many of our soctal ilt-
