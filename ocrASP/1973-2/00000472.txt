"There is something deeply wrongin America." This was the verdict
reached by a majority of those polled in a survey commissioned by the
Senate and conducted by Louis Harris, the results of which were releas-

ed Sunday. It would seem incredible for this to be the opinion ofa ma-
jority in a nation as prosperous as is ours. Yet one must probe deeper
than mere material comforts to discover the source of such widespread
disenchantment with the quality of American life. This decline is
primarily due to a loss of faith in American institutions, and an almost
complete lack of confidence in the executive branch of the Federal
government. Only 19% ofall those polled expressed faith in the ex-
ecutive, the lowest evaluation ofany institution included in the survey.
This constitutes an astonishing revelation of Mr. Nixon’s true standing
among his constituents and serves to dispel any ideas that there may be
a “silent majority” who still support him. The survey also showed that
of all public institutions, only television news and the press have risen
in esteem since 1966. Confidence in both is substantially higher than in
the executive. Obviously the nation is notbeing swayed by Mr. Nixon’s
claims that it is the news madia. and not the government’s wrongdoing,
that have made Watergate into a major issue.

Meanwhile, questions of the President’s integrity have notyet been
resolved. Mr. Nixon’s lawyer and his personal secretary maintain
different theories as to how the famed “l 8 minute gap” in one of the
tapes had occurred. Mr. Nixon‘s spokesman claims that the gap was
caused by an accidental erasure of that portion of the tape by Mr. Nix-
on’s secretary. But the President‘s secretary, Rosemary Woods.has
said that she erased only a small part of the disputed segment. This is
but one more contradiction in the various stories offerred by the White
House, and Mr. Nixon is no closer now to allaying the public‘s doubts
about his integrity than he was when the existence (or non-ex istence) of
the tapes was first revealed.

That the peopleiof this country have expressed little faith in their
' government is not surprising. The above incident: is but oner of the
latest questions raised as to the President’s personal integrity,and were
both made public after the survey was conducted. A poll taken today
might find the nation‘s faith in the executive to be even less. The survey
also indicated that the lack ofconfidence is notgenerated to ward the
institution itself. but in the particular men in power today; the ex-
ecutive branch ofgovernment is the only institution in the survey which
engenders less faith now than it did in May of I972. Mr. Nixon‘s sub-
version of the Presidency has been totally responsible for the downfall
in the public eye of that once revered institution.

That people feel there is something “deeply wrong in America“ is a
sad commentary perhaps not so much on the state of the nation as on
President Nixon. An informal survey of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee conducted by the New York Times has disclosed that a majority
ofits members feel that impeachment would be justified if Mr. Nixon
were found to have lost the faith of the American people, even ifhe had
not committed an indictable crime. The peoplehaveannqunced their
verdict. The duty of the Congress is clear.

The Semester That Was...Was

'lhe semester has ended. As semesters go.
it was pretty much like any otlter semester;

them. As tar as semesters go. however. this
semester was just fine. lhirt is not to saytltat

Promises, Promises ‘

To the Editor: _

Since I948 Israel has grown as a nation to
such importance that even the high powers
of the world are in turmoil over this small
ponion of land. Some of thequcstionsbeing
asked on thisissueare:“Whose land isthis?”.'
and. ‘How come Israelis there with all odds.
against her?“ | feel the answer to these
questions comes out of Jewish history and
the writings of Moses and the prophets.

In the ﬁrst book of Moses, God spoke to
Abraham and gave him a promise: "To your
descendants lgive this land from the river of
Egypt to the great river. the river Eu-
phrates.“ And to another of the great
patriarchs. He gave the same promise: “Go
up into this mountain of Abarim and see
tltc land which lbavc given to the people of
Israel.“ Jewish history tells us that theirGod
promised this land to them and told them to
possess it and to destroy all wickedness in it.
As we read in the brink of Joshua they did
just that. biit soon after. as the peoplelooked
around them at the uncircumsised world
with tlll its pleasures and riches. they turned
their backs on God and disobeyed His com—
ntaodmurls. Because of this tltc Lord took
away their land: lirst Israel taken by the
Assyrians and then Judah taken by the
llabylontans. After 70 years of captivity.
('vrus. long ol Persia released the Jewsand
allowed them to return to their latid as
prophesied by Jeremiah. However. only a
retnrtatii returned because the others had
grown too accustomed to the pleasures of

Babylon. Brit slowly the nation began to rise
in power and authority even under the at-
tacks ol tltc Syrians and the surrounding

llilllUllS.

As tliehistory ol this new nation progress-
ed. the people agiin turned their bricks on
their (iod and looked more towards political
power and authority itntrl iii 70 A.l).j the
lcrnplc lll Jerusalem was destroyed and the
.lcws were dispersed throughout all the
world where they have been until PMX. As
the prophet E/ckiel stated in the year 580
li.C.li.. “l (Adonai) scattered tbciti ranting
tltc nations; and they weredisperscd through
tltc countries; in accordance with theircon-
duct and their deeds l judged them."
