extended cuts “Dancing .thh the
Moonlit Knight.” “Firth'of'Fifth,”
“The Battle of Epping'Forest," and
“The Cinema Show / Aisle of Plen-
ty.“ The only problem here is that
the album is close to fifty minutes
long. Whenlisteriingto the album in
its entirety for the ﬁrst time. the
music may cause ear strain. caus-
ing the songs to sound uncomfor-
tably indistinguishable from one
another. Suggestion: Take in small
doses (maximum doseone side). cs-
pccially if you are tired to begin
with.

Now about the songs. “After the
Ordeal" is the only instrumental
on the album. The first half ofthc
cut is pleasant guitar-piano play;
the second half is mournful organ-
guitar material. reminiscent of
f’rocol Harum. Itdragsjusta bit A
quiet accoustic number. “More
Fool Mc."stands out as the only
love songon the album. Sung in the
first person (1 Irate to tax your
memory of language) it is a
noticeable contrast to the rest of
the album. and almost seems otlt of
place.

Generally. the songs make social
comment through observations as
seen by the writer through himself
or through a :haractcr. In "I
Know What I Like (In Your War~

that of a gardener. lhe othersongs

the Staple Singers when they were

Keep your eyes and ears open for
the presence of Maria Muldaur
wherever or whenever she may hit
the metro area in the future. She is
one of the finest. sexiest and
emotional singers who I‘ve come
across since the days of Joplin. It
was a pleasant evening indeed. be-
ing the ﬁrst time a group of moun-
tain folk musicians got together in
this kind of travelling show. The
friendly neighborhood get together
with these people from Woodstock
urn only be hoped to rcoccur.
