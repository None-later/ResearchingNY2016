Better days are here for
Albany State Swimming. As
\vuve alter wave of swimmers
churned the writers of the pool
on Saturday. the Mcnncn
achieved a respectable fourth
place in the Great Dane Rclziys.

The meet consisted ol‘ri series
of eight relays and one diving
event. Two hundred and lilty
competitors represented twclvc
schools that were divided into
University and Junior Collcgc
divisions. The meet was
tedious. lasting four hours. It
seemed difﬁcult for the
swimmers to remain psyched
over such a long, period,
