Shuttle Bus Service

taiti that in the near future Mobil
will make cuts lll the amount of

Sirotkin said yesterday that she
believes that there is littlclikelihood
for the President to extend theap-
proaclring Christmas vacation.
l'he President. she reported. said
that before any final decision was
to be made. he would fully consult
with faculty rind students to assess
their views on an extension.
Sirotkin‘s office gave no date when
this decision will be ntade

Factors influencing the final
drxision. Davidson said. would iti-
elude the status of theother SUNY
schools and the seriousness of
Albany's ow'n lucl shortage.
Davidson also said thatall students
would be rnforrned ol the final
decision as soon as it has been
reached. If. however. no rrilirrg is
tirade rrntrl alter the vacation has
started. the Administration will iti-
loriu every student through a mail-
ing to his liorrie.

the possibility of a cliangeol mind.

Davidson eiuphasr/cd that she was

siori. Gerber said that there are no
definite plans to change the

ant damn sure of." Gerber said. “is
that the last thing the students will
