confusion concerning the
possibilities of waiving the pay-
ment of the Student Tax.

The new bill grants automatic
full waivers to students who are
members Iof the. clergy. who com-
mute to SUNYA from an area
greater than thirty miles away, who
work more than thirty five hours
per week. or who are responsible
for suppon or care of a child.
Documentation of automatic
waivers must be in the form of
proof of birth of the child or a
statement from the employer
listing the hours worked by the stu-
dent per week. The new policy
grants partial waivers to student
teachers and those students whose
education is ﬁnanced primarily
by the OJ. Bill.

Also considered for waivers are
sttidcnts who have files with the
Financial Aids Office or the Inter-
national Students Office. In this
case. the student should apply to
the Student Activity Assessment
Committee for his waiver. The
Committee will consult with thcof-
lice with which the individual is in-
volved and that ofﬁce will recom-
mend it decision to the Committee
as to the individual‘s eligibility for
a waiver.

Students who believe that they
are entitled to a waiver must apply
every semester. with the exception
of those demonstrating support or
care of a child. Such students need
apply only every other scinestcr.
All applications for the waiver of
payment of the Student lax for the
Spring Semester are dire January
28. I974.
