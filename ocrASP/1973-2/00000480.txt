The public heating room on the
second floor of City Hall was very
crowded. There were seats for no
more than ﬁfty spectators. while

many more than that
News number of Albany
citizens had shown up
for the city budget
hearing Monday
night. They were th'ere to urge the
Common Council not to approve
the proposed $4l.6 million dollar
I974 budget.‘

But the balding, white haired
aldennen seemed oblivious to the
plus of their fellow citizens.
Spmker after speaker from the
gallery went to the witness stand to
testify against the budget. but not
even a glimmer ofa reaction could
be seen on their staid. wrinkled
visages. They remained poker-
facad as critics charged that the
budget is a fraud. that it would
waste millions ofdollars in support
of political patronageand that the
aldemten should postpone their
approval of it until they could get
answers to hundreds ofquestions
“Are you going to be wooden head-
ed ma rionettes'." critic Theresa
Cooke asked them.

The response came at the end of
the meeting when the budget was
finally \ oted on The clerk read the

The. debate over reclamation

encompasses two questions: can
the land ever be adequately
relclaimed and will it befrcclaimcd'.’
In Appalachia the answer to the
ﬁrst question proves to be a ten-
tative yes. in the few cases where
enough time. effort and money
have been invested. It is too early to
tell just how successful the long
term rcsultswillbe.Thecxampleof
Appalachia. hOWever. also in-
diattes the answer to the second
question is no. Unless the ocm-
panics are forced to reclaim the
land they will not doit.
Biologists are concerned about the
effect strip mining has on nearby
ilnlmtll. aquatic and plant life.
Even on seemingly successful
reclamation projects only a small
pcrccntttgc of the original plant
species evcr retum because the
mineral content nfthc soil has been
iiltcrcd. Strip mining destroys the
feeding areas of big game birds
and forces them to ovcrpopiilatc
other atrctis. Costs of reclamation
projects \itry according to mine
liiCtlllUlli some land hits been
reclaimed at $3t)0;.n scrc. morcdif-
iicttlt areas may require up to $|t)_-
titlt) till acre.

Despite the disadvantages, strip
mining continues. lt accounted for
