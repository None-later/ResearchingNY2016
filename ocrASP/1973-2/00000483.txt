“The Paper Chase” began its 45
day shooting schedule with
locations on the campus of Har-
vard Law School. where the story
of law students coming to grips
with a destructiver competitive
system takes place. and then, in the
second week of production to
Toronto, Canada, where most of
“the comedy-drama was shot.

With a script by James Bridges.
who also directed, it is based on a
very popular l97| novel by John
Jay Osborn. Jr.,who wasa law stu-
dent at Harvard while writing the
book. Osborn ltas expressed great
satisfaction with the way Bridges
has been faithful to the book‘s
characters and getting across the
sense oftbe pressuresthcse men are
subjected to at Harvard to get good
grades.

"The Paper Chase" is an ex-
tremely youthful production. The
producers, Robert C. Thompson
and Rodrick Paul. could
themselves pass for students. and
Rod. at 20, is not only one of the
youngest film producers in
lloltywood. but is a year younger
than the star of tlte film, Timothy
Bottoms, who at tlieage when most
young men are starting out in their
professions is at the top of his. His
first film role at age 17 was as the
pitifully crippled young war
veteran in Dalton l'rumbo's
"Johnny (iot His Gun.“ His work
in that film came to the attention of

was eastingfor “The Last Picture
Show.” Timothy won the lead as
the sensitive young man stuck in a
dying Texas town. His perfor-
mances in both ﬁms have made
him one of the most sought after
young actors in Hollywood.

Botton’s leading lady.I equally
young. is beautiful Lindsay
Wagner, who is co-starring in her
second major film this year-she
recently completed Robert Wise‘s
“Two People“ in Parisand Moroc-
co. Timothy and Lindsay are sur-
rounded by bright, talented young
actors from the New York stage.
among them Graham Beckel,
James Naughton, Ed Herrmann
and Bob Lydiard. Because oftheir
background on Broadway, they
felt right at home with the veteran
in the film. John Houseman, the
legendary producer-director-
writer of sortie of the most famous
productions over the past three
decades. In his auspicious debut as
