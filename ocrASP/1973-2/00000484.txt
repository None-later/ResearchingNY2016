\ Fiscal lrresponsibility

There is only one word apprOpriate to deseribe’the Monday night
Albany Common Council meeting: APPALLlNG.

The aldennen erased any doubts in our minds that they are what
critic Theresa Cooke called “wooden headed mar‘ionettes" by voting
unanimously for Mayor Corning‘s budget.

The budget they so willingly passed was. like so many previous
Albany budgets. a complete fraud. It included millions ofdollars of
unnecessary expenditures - money that will most certainly end up
paying off friends. It was wftat one would expect from a political

machine.

We were naive. We expected more. After witnessing some very
close elections last month. we thought the incumbents would finally
initiate some reforms. But we were wrong. This latest budget was
presented in the same inadequate manner as before.

The budget came as a pamphlet. no bigger than a football
program. while the budget of the neighboring city ofSchenectady is
the size ofa Manhattan phone book. With such a flimsy l‘oriitat.it is
naturally impossible to adequately explain the proposed expert-
ditures. There are necessarily very few breakdowns of large lump

sum appropriations. with such listings as: “Labor. 5450.000" and

Youth Resources: $450,000."

the proposed expenditure of $4M) million is much too high fora
city of Albany‘s size. Syracuse. a city 70“); larger than Albany hits
only a $45 million budget. arid Syracuse rtiitsa zoo.a rnuriicipalair-
port. and has city-wide trash collection. allofwhicli Abariy hasriot.
Syracuse‘sallocations forstreet cleaning. snowplowingaiiid landfill
operations are all hundreds of thousands of dollars less tltari
Alhtttl\"s. while Albany‘s services are generally of inlcrior'titiality.
llie Albany budget allows $2100 per year for the rriarntcriancc of
eaclt police car. No saite person would kecpa car ifit cost that iitttelt
to run. 'I he budget gives $400 a y ‘ar raises to city hall white collar
workers. ivhileitproi ides rio raises for literallylttind reds til laborers
sllllcttt’lllltg the prehistoric $1.27an hour, lltc budget still assignst
custodians to city hall. a building no larger tltaii our own ('ampus
('eriter. Aniost ey ery litre of the budget is padded in this manner,

Yet tlte aldcriitert voted for it without a sitigledisseiit, lhcy voted
for ll iii the face of fervent pleas frorii the gallery to postpone the
mic until hundreds of questions cotild be answered. llicy \oted for
it in spite of all the hard evidence that this budget is a sham.

lhcy \ iolated lllclt'ptthllc trust by being totally irresponsible. lltc
contempt this city goiernrtierit shows for its citizens is beyond cont-
l‘llll’L‘./\lltl. \\‘C are rightfully disgusted.

'lo the Editor:

lam founder of the Institute for Studies in
Phenomenological Contextualism writing in
regards to the article by Arthur Brcen eit-
titled "The Semester That Wa s...Was“ which
upputred in the ASP on Tuesday. December

4.

Seldom (indeed. never in the ASP) have I
seen so sensitive and holistic an analysis of
the essence of existence at SUNYA. It was
very difficult for me to believe that such a
profound statement was able to find its way
into a campus newspaper.

I found it especially touching to lrrid
someone whose ideas are so near the core til
the phenomenological contextualist
methodology. Indeed. never has so faithful
and categorical a defining of material (llll/
immaterial essences been stated since tltc
phenomenological contextiirrlist Andy
Mdrich told the parable of the blind-deat-
rriute Ydria who. when given her sight.
hearingand voice through a ruiracleol faith.
strode into the market place stood on ll
pedestal. laced the crowd and rerriarketl
“lluh‘?”

It is such intuitive insights which seem to
well up from the collective unconscious that
\Hll make possible deliverance botlt trorri

unidirectional. riiultidimensional. holistic

SUNYA students are being swindled.
lhey are being swindled deliberately and
systematically by the English Department of
SUNYA. l'he swindle is called the “Popular

“Popular literature" isa term devised by
and for snobs. It is used most often by people
who have no li'rroii'lt'rlgt' of their subject.
since they cannot be bothered wrth "trash."
btit who write about it or talk about it
anyway,

“Popular literature" is the graveyard of
science fiction. It is where the Department
has hit ried the course originally designed and
taught by (‘trrt Smith (whom the Depart-
rriciit is also trying to buryt.

“Popular literature" is the trivial distrac-
tion of the semi—literate. which may not

Signing On The Line

To the Editor:

We are the students in Cun Smith‘sthree
English courses this semester. Curt‘s tenure
case is to be decided next week by President
Ilenezet. arid ashis students. we have follow-
ed this case closely. It was disclosed yester-
day that the Personnel Committee. which
last year had voted unanimously against
granting Curt tenure. agreed by a 6-2 vote
that this year he has presented substantial
new evidence in his favor. Last year‘s 8-0
vote against tenure recommendation is this
year a 4-4Iie. The next step is a recommen-
dation by Dean Schmidt followed by the
Council on Promotion and Continuing Ap-
pointment's decision. Next week the final
decision rests with President Benezet.

We should like to express our feelings
about this case by pointing out to the univer-
my community that Cu rt has been teaching
required courses for the past two semesters-
all of which have been just as highly
evaluated by students as his Science Fiction
.nrl Afro-American Literature courses a
year ago. In fact. last semester his graduate
level cotirsc was the highest rated course in
the entire English Department. He is
lcact'ing liriglish Composition. Popular
| iteraturc. and Science Fiction next
semester allot which were closed out by the

Curt‘s coursesare by no means "guts." He
refuses to fail anyonewhomakes an effort to
learn and will give him an opportunity to re-
write an unsatisfactory paper. As a result.
very few students are forced to drop Curt‘s
courses because they are failing. Is this not
the ideal goal ofedueation? We should learn
through our mistakes rather than be given a
"D" on a paper. receiving nothing from the
learning which is taking place save fntstra-
tion and failure.

Although Curt‘s assignments are heavy.
the classroom situation is structured sothat
everyone may participate. Attendance is
always large none of us like to miss Curt's
classes,

Perhaps we are only students. and as one
member ofthe English Department said at a
tenure review meeting last year regarding
students” teacher-evaluations. “What do
students know?" Not much about the legal
procts s involved in tenure. we're afraid
that llien. who does'!) However. we are
directly involved with (‘urt Smith and we
tiigc the ('PCA and finally President
liene/et to grant him tcririre. lhis ttttl\Cl'sll)'
cannot afford to lose ('un .ttiil we the
students will suffer the most it he is not
allowed to come back rtextyenr.
