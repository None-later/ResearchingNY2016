Hormones

EMKO is a highly etfecrive
spermicide in an aerosol foam
that is deposited at the open-
ing of the uterus with an ap-
plicator. The foam blocks the
sperm while the spermicide
kills them on contact.

EMKO contains no hormones
and does not enter the cir«
culation system or affecr your
body chemistry.

You use it only when pro-
tection is needed. Apply it in
seconds...up to an hour in
advance. Won't leak, run, or
interfere with sensations.

Recommended by physicians.
It is highly elfecrive, but so
safe and simple to use you can
buy it ill: drug departments
without a prescription.
