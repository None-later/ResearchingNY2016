The Danes are at Williams tomorrow.

taking on Williams College.

Last Saturday the Danes got
their feet wet with two outstan-
ding victories. The point
spread was more than even the
most optimistic could have ex-
pected. Losing only four
matches otrt of twenty and not
being pinned was unbelievable.

Veterans Larry Mims, Tom
Horn. Ethan Grossman. and
Rudy Vido all won both
matches and contributed a pin
each. The newcomers also
chipped in with everyone scor-
ing a point for the cause.

With this match 0111 of the

less trouble (in the road due to

vast experience. A young team

has mtich problems organizing
on the road. but with seven
returnees. the road trips are old
bill for Albany.

After this match the Danes
take on Bu 11an State at homca
week from Saturday. Because
there are finals the following
week. a small crowd is expected
but the Danes should do a de-
cent job at home.

During intercession the
wrestlers are expected to
wrestle in the MIT tourna-
rnetit. I his tournament is a life

Bedford Reﬂects on. Soccer Season

'by Nathan Snliint

Although the season has since
ended. the interest in soccer at
Albany State has only begun to
rise. With full winter and spring
programs ahead. the ASP talked
with Arthur Bedford. star fullback
ofthc Great Danes.

ASP: Arthur. can you fill the
readers in regarding your
background. etc.

Bedford: lwas born in Barbados.
and came to the United States last
September. I have always been in-
terested in sports, particularly
soccer. which I started playing
when I was five years old. I also
played cricket, table tennis. and
mo track for my school teams.
ASP: 1 am curious as to your
reasons for coming to Albany. l
know that you had offers from
other schools. Why did you decide
to attend Albnay State‘!

Bedford: A lot of schools ap—
proached meduring my senior year
with vague offers. Originally. l
wanted to go to Miami because it is
warm there. Also. Iwaritcd to play
against tough competition. but did
not watit to sit on the bench.

\thn Coach Schicllclin spoke
to me last year. he told tne that
Albany State was rcbtiilding. and
that 1 would definitely do a lot ol
playing. I wanted to go where 1
would help. Albany needed
players. Also. I knew most ol the
players who were coming Itcrc
because I played against thctn on
my school team. and had played
with them on the same teams such
as the Izastcrii States ‘\11 Star
Icam. Johnny and myscll also
played for the same cltib lL'tttll in
\ l't‘. Ilrcsc lactor‘s. plus the
reputation til the school lot good
education. helped me make my
decision.

\hl': What did yotr cypch prior to
lllls year's season”

Ilctll'ord: t‘cttianly not .in \( v\ \

which involves a more passing
tvpe game. We also had the
problem of what position each
player would do the best job at,
ASP: How do you account fortht
team's meteoric rise‘.’

Redford: First of all. the coach was
excellent. lie is a good trainer and
knows how to handle the players.
Second. there \tas good talk
between the players about the
different styles ol play.

us was the losses to l‘ictltillltl and

Redford: Basically. there is too
much competition front baseball.
football. basketball. etc.

ASP: Do you think thatsoccerwill
ever become a popular sport in this
country?

Redford: No. Definitely not. Back
iii 1950. the II. 5. beat England in
the eliminations of the World Cup
(‘haiirpionship by H). Ifthc sport
did not catch ontlicn.itneverwill.

Look at otrr games. Most ol'thc
crowds are loreigncrs. as are the
best players. [here is a lack of
American interest iii the sport.

Another problem iii the United
States is that hiin school soccer is
poor. whereas iii other countries.
hiin school soccer is on the level of
American college soccer. It is from
the hiin schoolsthat players Iortlic
national teams are chosen.

ASP: Can you explain what you
iricati about Iiiin school soccer be-
ing poor‘.’

IIt-tlfortl: Yes. I ook at the coaches.
\lost coaches are teachers. who

National Toumament. In most
other countries. you simply learn
from the better players.

ASP: Let‘s return back to the sub-
ject of the Albany State soccer
team. Who would you select for
the All-SUNYAC and All state
tcams‘.’

Bedford: Everyone. Soccer must
be played as a team. If the team
wins. than everyone is doing as
"ALI." job.

If you wnt me to single out in-

dividuals. I would say that some of
the guys have the potential to go
even further. Wayne.l.eroy. and
Johnny among others. certainly
lirive the chance to eventually
become All Americans. I hope that
someday lean get that honor.butl
played too poorly for it to be con-
sidered this year.

Also.chry. He is definitely one
of the best goalies around. He was
not as highly rated as the other
players. but did a grcrit job. keep-
ing as in games we could have lost.
He is the player I have the most
confidence in.

ASP: As you know. there have
been sotnc rather scrioirschargcs o1

here at Alhariy State. What is thy
situation on the soccer team? I:
there any racism?

ASP: This year. the team surprised
everyone with an NCAA bid.
What does the future hold in store
for the SUNYA soccer fans?

Bedford: Next year. the NCAA is
going to three divisions. lfwc are
invited. 1 think that we can win our
national division.

ASP: What does next year hold in
store for Arthur Bedl'ord‘.’

Redford: As you know. 1 was not
happy with my play this year. In
the beginning. the refs were upset-
ting inc. I became more involved
with them than with the games.
because of calls which I did not
agree with. Coach Scliieffcliii
rcali/cd it. and he straightened mc

My best game was against
Binghamton in the game we lost.
Weall wanted that gamc.but sortie

Ihcy still! that our limycristy
