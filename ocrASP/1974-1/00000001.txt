Smith D&Mill,er Spark Danes to

'by Bruce Might I .

Byron Miller‘s clutch followup
shot in the closing seconds plus
some real tenacioiisidefense in the
second half sparked. the'Albany
State basketball team to a narrow
victory Tuesday night against
‘Utica College.

The Danes really played two
different games. The first half was
one oftotal confusion on offense as
the Danes shotia poor 23% from
the field. But in the second half,
Reggie Smith and Byron Miller
took charge and they gave the
Danes two leaders to look for on
the court.

Once again Miller did not start
as Coach Sauers went with the
three "cshemn. Mike
Suprunowicz. Ed Johnson and
Gary Trevett. along with Smith
and Harry Johnson. The Danes
-quickiyi fell behind and with only
4244 gone in the game, Mr. Miller
came in to play the rest of the ball
game. The move didn‘t improve
matters as the Danes offense lugg-
ed. They lacked that much needed
quarterback on offense to control
the team. There was really no one
to look for on the court and
nobody wanted to take charge.
The Danes had trouble rebounding
and often battled one another un-
der the boards. At half time
Albany lourtd themselves down by
eleven points.

But the second half was a
different story. Seniors Smith and
Miller took over the leadership and
they controlled the offense. The
team was really moving well and
Albanviwas able to take the lead
for the first time after a l3-3 spurt
to start the half. At ihesame time

the offense was workinzt the
defense to quote Rich Kapner
“played the tough D." Ed Johnson
was pa rticular‘lyhmpressive in the
way he covered Utica's stariguard,
Rick Williams.

The contest proved to be very
similar to théWilliamdgame as the
outcome Went right down to the
wire. With under two minutes to
go. Albany found themselves up by
a point. Unlike the Williamsgame.
they tried to freeze the bail and the
Danes held it some forty seconds
beforei losing the ball to Rick

Williamsiwho was intum fouled to
prevent him from having a shot at
an easy layup. Williams, who is
Utica's best shoo ter. missed the
one and one situation and Albany

snared the rebound. The Danes .

had 56 seconds left and they still
clung to their very unsecure one
point lead. The Danes tried to
freeze it again andlthe seconds’tick-
ed down. The ball came to Miller
with 34 seconds to go. He held the
ball four secondsand faced a jump
bail if he held it a second longer.
Since he couldn't find anyone open
to passto, hecallcd a timeout. This
is where there is no substitute for
experience,

With time back in. Utica had no
choice but to foul Albany. This
brought Harry Johnson to the line
for a critical one and one situation.
He missed the shot but Byron
Miller‘s clutclt followup on the
shot gave Albany a three point
lead. The Pioneers hit with a se-
cond remaining but Albany had a
57-56 victory.

When Reggie Smith had to come
on he did. Smith helped spark the
team in the second ltalfas his twen-

Rich Kapner. in his quiet way,
got the job done as he served as a
steadying factor in the Danes
offense and defense. Rich reminds
one of former Dane guard, Dave
Welchons. Kapner I is still
hampered by leg problems and he
is not in the best of shape.

Byron Miller won back his star-
ting spot with great work in the se-

cond half. ' .Harry Johnson is still
the big question'markbn the team.
He has the talent, it's just the ques-
tion of when he is going to put it
together. Harry right now appears
to be pressing. He did manage to
do a good job rebounding as he
snared nine against Utica. ‘

Doc Sauers was “Glad to be
alive" after the Utica game. After
shuffling] his lineup in both the
Williams game and the Utica game,
Sauers will start Ed Johnson and
Kapner in the backcourt, Miller
and Smith atforward and Harry
Johnson at center against Cor-
tland.

return home for three weeks of
rest and relaxation. However.
such is not the case for the
Albany Great Danes Basket-

the Capital District Christ-

ritairy continued later in the
season as Stella gained revenge

cussed.

Union upset the Danes in the
final to abruptly end their
season after a string of vic—

almost identical to last year’s,
but there isa major difference.
