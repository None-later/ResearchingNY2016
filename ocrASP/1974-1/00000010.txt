Super Letdown

I think the University has something against tlte Super Bowl and
maybe rightly so after Sunday‘s game. for once again school was
about to resume right after the big gatnc. Much of the university
huddled around a television for what tnany thought would be a
most interesting matchup. Unfortunately. that was not the ease. as
the Super Bowl once again proved to be a super letdown.

Miami proved that they are an incredible machine but at the same
time. the Dolphins magnified the fact that football in the last five
years has become boring. With elaborate IOIIC defenses plus the
movement of the hashmarks closer, football is now dominated by
the ground attack. If the rim is stopped the field goal kicker is
brought on to make things just as dull. ‘

The National FootballLCitguebetter start thinking abotit sortie
rule changes or those many no shows that they have been talking
about will become non-paying customers. Let‘s bring back the ex~
citemcnt of the bomb. Not Csonka up the middle for" four.

Pressure on Three Freshmen

Rich Kapner must be one unlucky ballplayer as he continued his
string of injuries when he dislocated his shoulder against Brockport
two week sago.l,ast yea r he made the varsity basketball squad bill be
then litirt his ankle and after his recovery. Kapnei' played on the
junior varsity. 'l his year. Rich was not iii the best ol condition
because ol a charlie horse he sttstairied early in practice. Kapncr.
who will be out of action forat least three tiiore weeks. will be sorely
missed. Even thotigli he has onlya 3.x scot'ingavcragc. Kapner'does
many thin-gs that go unnoticed to the average fun. He plays a tough
aggressive defense and he has served as u stcadying influence for the
three freshmen guards.

lhe weight iii the backcotirt now switches entirely on lreslimari
Mike Suprunowiw. lid Johnson. and (iary Fi'cyitt. lhese three
haye shown dillereril levels of dcvclopriient in their lii'st season.

Supr'uiioyyie/ started to riiake the big adjustment to college ball
biit his progress has been hampered since injuring lllsllllly’l‘ earlier
iii the season against Cortland. Saiters fccls “Mike is back to yy here
he yy as before the injury and he slioiiltlbeadoiiblcligtit'c scorer."

Johnson Iias quickly becomcacroyyd layor‘itc “till his quick play.
.lohiison.rr product of the satire high school that sent Rob Iaiiierio
the pros. has had the problem of adiiisliiig lioiii a oriearn-oiie
ballplayer iii high school to a team player here at Albany. At the
start of the season. lad yyoiild take a shot instead ol passiiigto an
open man. No“ he has started looking for ilie free man. Sauers
would like a little riiore rebounding from I d bitt iii liinc. Johnson is
gotiig to be some kind of ballplaycr.

It'evitt‘s progress has been somewhat slower than that of John»
still and Suprunoyyicl' but he has started to cotne around. Hatters is
particularly pleased with li'evitt's deleiisiyc play. Ireyitt's rob is to
get the teanimoving. as he is quite a dt'ibbler. llis shirt is starting to
come around and he should see more duty now that he is the third
guard.

lhc Duties will need good support li‘om these Itcshiticn iii the
corriitig weeks if they are going to make any headyyiiy iii the
SliVYAt' this year.
