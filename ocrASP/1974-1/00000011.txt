Late Night Shuttle Service

by Mitre Semi and David
Harrienger

An agreement will soon be con-
cluded between the University and
the State Ofﬁce of General Services
to combine bus services. This pact
will allow SUNYA to make a ma-
jor cut in its gasoline consumption.
while maintaining nearly as many
bus runs as at the present. The later
buses running at night will con-
tinue to operate - a fact which
should allay the fears of many
downtown residents that night
brrses would be cut due to the fuel
shortage. However. during the
rtrsh hours. there will be fewer
regular buses for sttrdcrrts living
between Alumni and the Circle.
The 008 shuttlc stops only and'
Draper rind Alumni. This may in-
convenience students who live off
campus alortg the bus routes
sorrrewliat.

lhc ntaitt feature of the bus ser—
vice proposal. according to ll.
David Van l)yck of the Communi—
ty Relations ollice. involves the
DOS shuttle buses which serve to
ferry state employees from the up—
toyyn parking lots to the state office
buildings to the tJtt\\’ltto\\lt Albany
area. In the morning the state
errrployees park in the perimeter
parking lots of the State Office
building campus on Washington
Avenue. the DOS runs the
sitlllliChUSCS to carry them to work
in tlic area of the Capital down-
town. After each rtrti. the shuttles
retur'n empty to tire uptowrt park-
ing lots. llie plan under negotia-
rrori would have sortie of DOS
buses pick up students at Draper
llrrll on Western Aretiue. then
Altrttirti Quad. ritid rtrn tip
Washington Avenue to Ad-
rriiriistrrition Circle.

In the afternoon. the procedure
would be reversed. and the empty
()(iS buses headed downtown
would carry students from Ad-
rrrrnisrtatron Circle to l)rapcrarrd
Alumni tlrtrrng rush hours.

A SllNY A btis \Hli run back and
lottlr on Western Ayetttre to carry

Because of the fuel shortage. the
University has been faced with
eliminating 40 roundtrips of shut-
tle buses. The proposed bus shar-
ing. accordingto Vice President for
Management and Planning John
Hartley. will eliminate this necessi-
ty.
The bus arrangement is
scheduled to go into effect in early
February. and will apply only dur-
ing the hours when there is a rush
of students headed uptown in the
morning and-downtown in the
afternoon. At all other times. the
regular SUNYA buses will be in
operation . According to
assistant director of physical plant
lra l)eVoe. there will be no cut in
the number of busscs running dur-
ing non-rush periods. including the
late night buses. ft is tentatively
planned to use about twelve ()(iS

whose stopsare Draper and Altim-

Mtrcli disctrssiori has crtstred
srrice the need for a redrrctiorr in

possibility of reducing the rittmher

residents from attending many of
the social functions. movies. etc.

by David Lerner

A member of the University
Council on Promotions and Con-
tinuing Appointments‘alleged that
the Council engaged in unusual
and biased parliamentary
procedures in its deliberations over
the case of Dr. Curt Smith. The
charge held that the Council
deliberately attempted to subvert
Smith's chances to achieve tenure.
The charges were made by ayCoun—
cilman disgusted overthe Council‘s
actions during Smith‘s case.

The Council voted by ﬁve to four
with two abstentions to re-open
Smith‘s case for reconsideration
based on tltc idet that he had
presented substantial new evidence
to warrant such it reconsideration.
The Council member charged that

meeting. a negative rcommenda-

Stewart‘s vote against recon-
sideration was not included in the
Council's tally nor in its minutes to
the President.

The member took exception to
the wording of the minutes which,
he felt. unfairly misrepresented the
case to prejudice Dr. Smith's
chances. Specifically mentioned
were the minutes record of the
complaints made against Smith's
scholarly achievements or lack
thereof. "Although it was
recognized that the candidate may
not have produced as much as
desired because of entering a new
field. it was noted also that he had
entered the field at hisrown risk,
and therefore. the burden of proof
rested with him.“

This. the member said, is
nowhere near the proportionate
amount of comments made on the
case. and. he claimed. the minutes
are heavily weighted agiinst the
professor. ‘

Further. investigation of the
minutes shows that every positive
comment made about Smith was
immediately. meaning the next
sentence or within the same
paragraph. refuted by two to three
opposing objections. Thus. when
Council members brought up the

tion from Arthur Clarke. which
impressed some members. others

Smith as a scholar. There seemed

order to grant tenure. the majority
believed that there must be strong
evidence of both citcellcnt teaching
and solid research which proves
