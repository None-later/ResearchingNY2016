Security Director Williams:

Lock Your Doors I

by Doug Horwitz

Reported cases of crime on Albany State campuses
have been rising signiﬁcantly over this past academic
year. Director of campus security James Williams. said
he can't be sure the rise in reports necessarily reﬂects an
overall rise in crime. Williams thought that perhaps
students have more faith in the competence of the
department. so they disclose incidences that previously

Williams said. in order to curb the amount of crime on
campus we must Work towards a community effort.
“People have to help one another to help themselves” be
claimed. and that means becoming involved even though
it my-require the committment to be a witness. Williams
stressed that everyone “report suspicious activity.” Ac—._
cording to the security director. “we can get to the scene

would have passddunreported. However,there still Icons of any alledged crime in progress within a minute or

the possibility that there arejust more cromes being com-

mitted.

Most of the crimes committed on campus involve
theft. particularly articles from dorms. In the month of
Novemeber(l973) alone. $7.298 worth of property was
reported stolen. This represents a rise of over 50% from
the same month last year. Mr. Williams noted that most
of the burglary offences remain unsolved. In most in-
stances. the student is careless and forgets to lock his
door. As a result someone merely walks in and takes
whatever may be of value. To prevent being burglarized
Mr. Williams offerred the following suggestions.

W0

I) Keep suite and bedroom doors locked atalltimes.

2) At bedtime. keep wallets and all other valuable
belongings in the bedroom. not the suite.

December I97]

3) If buying a stereo system. buy one that‘s reasonably

cheap and not worth stealing.

In addition to followingthese precautionary measures
further sectirity is offered to the students by a student

creased:

security force which patrols each quad from 7PM-IAM

daily.

Williams said that be was "very pleased with student

patrol" but he noted further that even the most efficient
police force can‘t have large success without cooperation

lroni the community it is serving. In other words

Percentage change

Williams cited one example of students reluctance to
become involved. In the spring time when bicycles come
out in force. so do the bike stealers. Williams said then:
have been actual cases of people cutting off bicycle locks
in front of he library . without asinglc witness reporting
the crime. According to Williams. incidences such as
these will continue uncontrolled unless people are willing
to become involved and “help one another."

l'liough fewer crimes were reported in December of
'73 than in the same month of'72. the value ofthe stolen
property almost doubled:
