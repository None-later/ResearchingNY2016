In his recently delivered State of
the State speech Governor Wilson
stressed that his administration
will follow the“moderate way". He
will propose no new.
sweeping programs
to combat the ills of
our society. nor will
he seek to cut any of
the projects begtrn by his high-
spending pridecessor. By cautious-
ly travelling the middle ofthe road.
Mr. Wilson hopes that he can win
the Republican nominationand ul-
timately clcclioir to a lull term in
November.

I! is still too early to tell whether
this strategy is working. llie low-
key State of the State message was
designed to offend no one. and to
provide a little something lor‘

TUESDAY. JANUARY 22, rem

 

I974 will be a decisive year for
the Democrats in New York State
politics because for the first tlrne in
to years Nelson A. Rockefellerwill
not be a candidate for Governor.
Ever since Rockefeller became
Governor in I958, the state
Republican party has ruled the
Legislature every year except for
one year in the Senate and four
years in the Assembly. The
Democrats now feel that this is the
year they can takeover notonly the
Legislature but the Govemorship
as well. The first Democrat to
throw his hat into the ring for the
Governors-hip is curiously enough

You have said that your campaign
will be “election reform by exam-

A: ...What [have said is that we
will seek a maximum number of
small contributions. We will
report every penny that we receive
and where every penny goes. We
will do so. not based on what the
statute requires. but in timely
fashion and much more promptly
that the statute. U'ltimately. I‘d
like to see the state move in the
direction of public ﬁnancing with
an independent ethics board that
would have the opportunity to
oversee all this...

would you favor restricting the
amount of money a candidate can
trike in in contributions?
