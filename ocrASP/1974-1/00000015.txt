Bus Fares Hiked, Routes Cut

By Jill R. Cohen

“A critical shortage ofoperating
funds" has made it necessary for
the Capital District Transporta-
“tion Authority to increase fares on
all bus runs in the four-countyarea
served by CDTA effective January
I. I974.

The rationale for the fares hikes
was that one of the two sources of
revenue for the CDTA. the
mortgage tax paid by residents of
Albany. Schenectady. Troy and
Rensselaer counties. was severely
falling off. and could not be com-
pensated for by the fares collected
at their previous rates. According
to Dennis Fitzgerald. Manager of
Development for CDTAl . it had
been projected that by mid-
February the (“UTA would be un-
able to operate on its current
budget.

CD'I’A appealed to the county
legislatures for emergency funding.
btit was denied assistance. Witltout
the additional money. there would
ltave been an expected SZJIJXlO
shortage of funds between January I

E
| and April I. when the new fiscal 2

year begins.

This prompted the CD'l'A to
raise the btis fares so that operation
would not be threatened. Original-
ly'. the plan had calledi for the
elimination 01 most bus runs on
Sundays and holidays btit oti
January l7 it wass decided by
(‘Dl‘A authorities that the ad-
ditional revenue obtained; thus far
from the fare increase would iillou
tltosc runs which had been
scheduled to be discontinued as ol
January 30 to continue opeiiition,

l‘it/geiald noted that iii raising
the hits lares. the ('lll \ lcarcd a
loss in ridership which did not, Ill
liict. itiatcriiilr/e. Ihc consequent

increase in revenue was the most
salient factor in the decision to save
the endangered bus runs.
SUNYA students are likely to be
inconvenienced by the fate increase
and route cutbacks. which affects
all CDTA buses in the Albany
area. All routes that were formerly
35 cents are now 40 cents. including
the_ Washington Avenue (Route
l2). Western Avenue (Route l0)
and the Western-Washington

   

(Route ll) mm which are often J I

used by students. Should it be neit-
essary in the future to reduce bus
service as previously planned. it is
likely that the Western -
Washington run will be discon-
tinued.

The Central Avenue bus. which
goes to Colonic Center is now 50
cents. Further fare and schedule in-
formation maybe obtained by call-
ing the CDTA at 457-! IOO.

a small union of wood cutters and
haulers. is striking the giant pulp

Southern Conference Educational

between the cutters and the pulp
mills is the closest thing to inden-
.tured laborand sliarecropping still
left in this counrty.
