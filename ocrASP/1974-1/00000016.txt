lThé'Long Goodbye

' The new information to come out on the Curt Smith ease reminds us once again of
the Administration’s power to do exactly what it wants; regardless of the system of
checks and balances supposedly built into our govemmentalstructure. For two
years, students and teachersvhad fought a vain attempt to secure tenure for Dr. Smith.
They suspected then, as they know .now, that Smith did not gain tenure simply
because the Administration did not wish to grant him tenure. Smith, by his own ad-
mission, is~a “dangerous” man to have around.

By now, it should be obvious that this Administration just does not tolerate
maverick thoughts. As in all administrations, be they Federal or Academic, the
overriding rule of the game is total, absolute conformity. Any deviation from that
rule is necessarily wrong, and must be eliminated. In this case, Administration has
succeeded in eliminating Dr. Smith. But that is only one voice in a crowd. Despite the
Administration's enormous powers, it will become increasingly difficult for even
them to silence allthe dissenters. all the new-thinkers.

The recent display ofdisregard for the orderly rules of procedure in the conduct
and execution of Curt Smith‘s case only serves to amplify the indifference that the
Administration holds for student opinion in general. Professors have been granted
reconside ration, if not tenure itself. for examples of sufficiently new evidence far
less impressive than the evidence offered in deferse of Dr. Smith. It is truly unfor-
tunate that this man had to be both an excellent teacher and a free-thinker. Had he
been just either one. his loss would have been that much easier to absorb. That he was
both is an outrage not only to the profession of teaching. but to the University as a
tvhole.

There will be others men and women— deserving of tenure. for whom the Ad-
ministration will frnd the excuse to deny them theirjust reward. for one reason or
another. This is no time to be merely disappointed at the turn of events. There are
other Curt Smiths. and not all will go his way.

Bureaucratic Brainstorm

With the knowledge that the Office of General Services ofthe State of New York
and the State University of New York at Albany are in the process of working out a
deal concerning consolidation of bus services, it appears t that even state
bureaucracies can get together to work for the common good - occasionally.

The facts are that the 005 pays fora bus to shuttle Capitol area workers from their
cars in the Washington Avenue parking lot (located about lArnile from SUNYA) to
theirjobs at a time when the S UNYA buses are overcrowded. Conversely, during the
afternoon rush hour, the opposite is true, with SUNYA buses overloaded on the
downtown run. and the 005 buses going empty in the same direction bringing
workers back to their cars.

The idea is simple: to consolidate runs by using the 008 buses in the morning to
‘bring students to State, and in the afternoon to bring them home again.

There is a problem, however. About twelve OGS buses would be utilized while four
5 U N YA buses would run their regular routes during these rush hours. Since the 005
buses would stop only at Draper and Alumni Quad (the corner of Partridge and
Western). this meanbtthat off-campus students will either] have to wait for longer
periods between the green buses. go uptown other times than the rush hour, or walk
further to catch the bus.

On the positive side, this measure will definitely conserve gasolinelbecause about
forty runs of the SUNYA bus will be eliminated, conserving gallons ofthe golden li-
quid each day. More importantly, however, in a time when bureaucracies threaten to
become “orbs unto themselves" as Emerson said about men. some may feel a little
reassuranCC that such a measure. even as small as this one. can be worked out by these
complex organilations,

 

On page one of today's issue appears a story based in part on the normally confidential
rtitntiics til the December I7, I973 mcctrng of the Uniycrsity ('ourtcilon Promotions and (‘on-
ttnurng Appointments, We have not taken lightly the decision to publish this information It is
only in the interest of informing the university community on this extremely important riitrttcr
that we have chosen to do so.

WASHINGTON - ’l he initial impact of

Albany has great potential to be a better
school. but since this depends on the quality

of education and the quality of student from.

the school, the student- teacher bond should
be fostered. The professors losing their
tenure decisions have usually been popular

among the students. There is a theory that .

the practice of keeping a professorforthrec
years then denying him tenure is devioust
devised. and honestly clad as a method of
having a cheap source of teitehers.To have a
better school. some degree of stability should

L

be promoted so that the politics of education
don't overshadow the realities of learning.
The tenant farmer and landlord were both

bound to the system. as are the professors "

and the tenure committee. Both the com-
mittee members and the professors are
human with human foibles. but I wish they
both have the strength to find a more just.
less biased method to decide a professor‘s
tenure.
