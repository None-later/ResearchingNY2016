crowded Albany‘s Palace Theater
to hear the slightly celebrated
works of P.D.Q. Bach. l picssed
my..way through the tuxedos and
gowns of the first floor elite; made
a bee-line for the stairs. and found
my row in the great heights of the
Palace known as the-student ticket
section.' A pleasant girl Wearing a
white robe and carrying a harp
gave me a program and indicated
to me that my seat was “right this
way.” As it turned out. her station
was very close to where I sat. Even
at these heights I couldn‘t com-
plain; I familiarized myselfwith the
names of the works to be per
formed by the ample reading light
emanating [from her halo (an es-
timated 75 watts). Beforehand I
had no idea what pieces lcould ex-
pect to hear. if it weren‘t for that
scraphic blond I would have
remained in the dark. I hope she
doesn‘t get hit too hard by the
energy crisis - she‘s already been
cut brick 25 watts.

At 8:30 P.M. when the show was
scheduled to begin. the audience
was greeted by an insulting rin-
nouncer. who announced that

Professor reached the stage. After
he caught his breath. he introduced
himself with the aid ofa card in his
pocket. this being necessitated by a
brief lapse of memory. Wearing an
outfit made fashionable by the
likes of RufusT. Fireﬂy and Otis B.
Driftwood. the Professor was held
together by his tux tails and out-
Itaiiging shirtail. not to mention his
work boots. He briefly discussed
hisbackground at the University of
Southern North Dakota at Hoo-
ple. and proceeded to plug his
latest album. “The Intimate
I’. I).(). Bach“ on Vanguard
records. The Professor mentioned
tltrit pressing of the album was held
up by the vinyl shortage. although
Vanguard “offered to press it on
licorice."

Schickele explained the periods

Happy Children

by Kevin Daniels

()n a Septemberday In London‘s
Larisdowiie Studios. ()sibisti laid
down the tracks of their lourtlr
loitg play album and extended plziy

they had compiled a list ol’eight ex-
ceptionally solid songs. all com-
posed. arranged and performed by
therrisclyes ()sibrsa consisting of
llddy ()sqi. saxophone and flute;
Mac lottolt. lruritpet and
I'luegelhorn; Sol Aniarlio. drums
and bongos; Koli Ayivor. Congas
and Jean Dikoto Mandenquc. bass
is primal. basic. earthly. good-time
emotion packed music. Osibisa is
pure. fresh and flowing. l'heir
African and West Indian cultures is
brought to its fullest essence iit
their music. All of the personnel
are of tltc highest arid rarest order
of musicians wrth superbly solid
material rti this extrcmcls pleasing
offering.

The absence of Spartacus R.

hardly riotrceablc with replacement
Jean Dikoto heitig more than suf-

the program. The first nu 'mbei
was the “Schleptet in E flat.” in-
cluding the “adagio saccharino"
("having one of the sweetest
melodies"). the “yehudi menuet-
to." and the “presto hey nonny'
nonio.“

The piece's beginning was delayed
because the professor had no music
stand. When he wasn‘t given one.
he conducted hisquintet from a sit-
ting . and occasionally. lying. posi-
tion. A rather informal
relationship with the musicians
resulted as they lowered their
stands in order to accomodatc their
crackpot conductor. The first note
of the piece was long. sustained.
and loaded with anticipation. The
french horn player passed out.
Once this player recovered.
Schickele continued the Schleptet.
Working together. he and the
quintet surmounted the inherent
problems of the piece. Two
members of the quintet included
Albany professors Irvin Gilman on
flute arid Rene l’rinson oboe. who.
in spite of all obstacles. helped
wonderfully throughout the en-
tire struggle.

Before beginning the next
number. Schickele said.“lt's only
lair to warn you first many people
consider the Schleptct to be his best
work." With that off his chest and
oii ours. Schickele introduced one
til his own composition. "lime
chirte Nichtmusik." [his piece.
with Albany Symphony conductor
Julius llcgyr coitdueting a larger
ensemble. incorporated a number

til themes into a work of Morart‘s
which incident ally has a name
similar to Schikele‘s piece.

It scented to me that the piece
became ri contest for the musical

intellectuals of the crowd. When
you recognized any of the many
famous themes. you were entitled
to laugh - the laugh being an in-
dication of musical knowledge.
The less people who laughed, the
higher the point value and im-
mediate ego boost. If you laugh
alone; that‘s minus one hunderd
points. Least points went for“Dix—
ie." “Anvil Chorus (You‘d
recognize it instantly if you heard
it)". “Mary Had A Little Lamb."
and “For He's A Jolly Good
Fellow." Also “Oh Susanna.“
“Twinkle . Twinkle."and “I Dream
of Jeanie With The Light Brown
Hair." Somewhat more difficult
were the snippets from Beethoven‘s
"Pastoral" symphony and
'l'chaikovsky‘VNuteracker.“ as well
its it quick snatch of “Anitra‘s
Dance." from “Peer Gym." 11

certo." and a hit of 'l'il liu-
lenspiegel. lldid itot qualify for the
finals - ldidn't recognireall tltose I
didn't mention. l hope after
reading this. you don't think this
“game” actually took place. But it
sure felt like it did.

Ilclorc intermission. Sehikclc
presented I’.I).Q. llach's “(iross
Concerto for Divers l‘llllcs. Iwo
Irtirrtpcts and Strings." Ihe Itigli
point of this piece of odd iti-
slrumentation was Scltikele's vir-
tuoso performance on slide whistle
and on the ()scar Meyer Wiener
whistle. Ihe latter is one of the
smallest instruments to be featured
in orcltcstrri.but. as Schickele cunt-
merited. "What If lacks in sin". it
more than makes up for in flavor."

The “Echo Sonata for Two Un-
. friendly. Groups of Instruments"

opened the second part of the.

program. This masterfully e'x-
ploited the rivalry between
Woodwinds (ﬂute. oboe and bas-
soon) onstage and brass (two
trumpets. trombone and french
horn) located in the balcony. The
brass bullied their way through the
number and even refused to play
the final notes. But they did  at
gunpoint.

Tne last Work to be performed .
“Concerto For Piano Vs.
Orchestra.“ capped the evening off
as a spectacular show closer. The
movements. the '“allegro im—
moderato.“ thc “andtinte con Mr.
Motti.“atid the "Vivace Iiberace."
were perfect vehicle for the full
sound of the Albany Symphony
Orchestra and for the obstinacy of
Professor Schickelc on piano. The
Professor. at piano. is both the
height of restlessness and the
cpitonte of lethargy. At all times he
is quite a visual experience.

Altltotigli the Concerto did not
blow the roof oil the theater. the
professor‘s insane performance
blew the seat off his bench. Alter
this explosive climax lo the concer-
to. the piece was guidcd to its close
as the stiioke cleared away.

I’rrilessor Scltickele answered
the applause at the end ol the cort-
ccrt with numerous bows and
returns to the stage. Once he even
instantly stopped tltc clapping with
a mere flick of his upi'aiscd hands.
lliis could oiin be the power of
genius.
