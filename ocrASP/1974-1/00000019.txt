The Albany State basketball
team. like many young teams,
have been plagued by inconsis-
tent play. Last Friday was no
exception as they played a
lackluster game in beating
Stony Brook, 77-70.

Albany came out and looked
like they’had ﬁnally put it
together. Led by the Johnson
boys. Ed and Harry, Albany
was able to take a l4 point lead
and just about blew Stony
Brook off the court. Ed John-
son was hitting his favorite
twenty-five footers with great
consistency and Harry Johnson
was passing and shooting like
the old Harry Johnson. The
Johnsons teamed up for one
beautiful play when Harry.
playing some tough defense.
forced a Stony Brook turnover
and dribbled downcourt. where
he fed Ed Johnson for an easy
layup.

But just as things looked rosy
for the Danes. the team went
liar and allowed Stony Brook
to close the gap. Albany‘s l'ad
diminished because ihcycom-
riiitted needless fonts and
numerous turnovers. l he fouls
particularly hurt as Albany's
big guns. Byron Miller and
Reggie Smith were in foul dif-
ficulty. The Danes went into
the lockerroom at half time
with a five point lead btit they
could have led by twenty.

l'he second half echoed that
of the first with the Danes
showing some good spurts of
basketball but they retreated
into some sloppy play and

 

Stony Brook was finally able to
take the lead by a single point.
That seemed enough to awaken
the Danes. Albany started play-
ing the type of ball they‘re
capable of playing with Gary
Trevett's movement of the ball
being a prime factor. Quickly
scoring six straight points. the
Danes grabbed a narrow lead.
They then showed how well
coached the team is. when with
seven minutes remaining in the
contest. Albany froze the ball.
l'hey executed it almost to
perfection as the players weav-
ed around and moved the ball
from man to man. This forced
Stony Brook to foul and
Albany was able to sink eleven
baskets from the foul line in the
closing minutes to insure vic-
tory.

(iary Trevett has had the
problem of adjusting to college
brill. but Friday he played
perhaps his best game as a
Dane. He ran the offense in the
closing minutes of the game.
l'revcit chipped in with ten
poitits birt his work in the
Danes slowdown plris his ac-
curacy at the foullinc coir-
trihuted substantially to the
Danes‘ victory.

off his game. sltootitig only one

importantly. those shots are go-
ing in.

scored [8 points. Pete Koola
made his Albany debutand saw
substantial action with both
Miller and Smith in foul trou-
ble. He will need time to work
himself into top shape.

The lackluster performance
of the basketball team could be
partially attributed to the
lackluster crowd. With a cold
gym. the crowd‘s enthusiasm
seemed dampened and they
only came alive when Stony
Brook momentarily took the
lead.

One would think that the
cold gym would have cooled off
the Danes. shooting wise. This
was not the case as Albany shot

Sometimes it seems that the
forwards and the backeourt are
playing two different games at
the same time. Trevett may be
the one who can quarterback
the team. He‘ll have to show
that he can put two good games
back to back. The team will
need consistent play from
everyone.

Tonight the Danes take on
Marist College at the Gym.
starting at 8:30. it will bea good

~ Fail-to Pin Cortland

by Kenneth Arduino

The Albany wrestling team
took it on the chili for the first
time all year as the matmen lost
to Cortland Zl~l(i.

The matmen showed a little
rust and got off to slow start
losing two out of the first three
and managing to draw in the
third. The matmen then picked
up victories in four ofthe next
seven matches along with a se-
cond draw. Yet is was not
enough as they failed'to win any
matches via a pm. It was the

 

first time this year that they
failed to liayc a least one pin.

Again the inexperience at
