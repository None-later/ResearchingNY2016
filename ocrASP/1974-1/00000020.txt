Against SUNY at Stony Brook

by 'Glfr‘ lil'atner.
SASU MServiee

An injunction has been brought
against the University for
prohibiting married couples with
children from living in campus dor-
mitories. The suit was ﬁled. by
a group of married Stony Brook
students.

The suit is a class action and will
“in effect represent all married
students with and expecting
children." according to Barry
Frutcher. a graduate English stu-
dent involved in the case. The suit
stems from an incident last July in
which six married. couples with

 

children were informed that they
were “living in violation of Univer-

sity regulations" and were ﬁnally '

forced to evacuate their residences,
according to Elaine Frutcher.

Dr. Toll has said that children
cannot live in dormitories since
they were not designed to accom-
modate families.

Ms. Fruicher reported that after
an initial letter. which was con-
sidered an “ofﬁcial reprimand." the
students requested a hearing to air
their grievances and only received
another letter "reiterating" the
ﬁrst.

She recaTled that if the students

their child(ren) taken off campus.
they would be ﬁned 55 per day per
person in a retroactive'order. The
students were given two days in
which to make their decision.

of the six families involved,
three agreed to send their children
to stay with relatives. In addition,
one other acquiesced. but as both
parents were foreign and the child
was an American citizen. they
needed a passport to send the child
to relatives. Two couples. in-
cluding the Frutchers. left the cam-
pus four days later.

A University spokesman said
that “in general our position is that
the University has sought married
student housing but has been un-
successful like the other SUNY
campuses. We must follow
regulations...should not have
children living in the dorms.“

The injunction was ﬁled in the
Brooklyn Federal Court because,
according to Ms. Frutcher. it in-
volved a “grievance with a state in-
titution" so it should be taken to
the federal level.

The students feel that they are
entitled to live in tire dormitories
and are now forced to ﬁrtd offcam-

The leading letter was from Konstantin Simonov. the best known writer
