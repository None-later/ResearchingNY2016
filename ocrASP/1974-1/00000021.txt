In Tuesday's AS P was a letter to
the editor from a Thomas Robin'-
son. who complained of being be-
ing barrassed with a billing error
from a semester six year ago. He
wrote the letter in the midst of an
exchange of telephone calls.
records and other letters between
himself. the Bursar‘s office. the
New York Department of Law. the
Alumni Association and other par-
ties. The semester in question is
Fall. I967; Robinson was a Grad
student at the time. The amount of
money in dispute is 560.

There were three major par-
ticipants in thecxtended exercise in
writing. First. Mr. Thomas F.
Robinson. the SUNYA alumnus
whose account is in question.
Robinson. who sports a bright red
beard and jogs regularly the was on

with sincerity. He is presently do-
ing heart research at Rl’l. Miss
Barbara Iiiclby is the head of the

Ilie llursar‘s oltice in routineac-

Robinson at least two notices since

quent account with the Universi-

original bill to Mr. Robinson; a
copy was sent to Page.
Meanwhile. Robinson wrote
Page thanking him for acting ef-
ﬁciently and promptly to his phone
call and adding more information
to the pile. Miss Bielby then wrote
Mr. Page (sending a coy to Robin-
son) with further explanations.
Robinson was unsatisﬁed with the
itemization Bielby sent before; he
asked for a copyofthe original bill.

Unhappy about the entire situa-
tion. Mr. Robinson wrote the ASP
and the Alumni ofﬁce; the Alumni
office wrote back expressing its
sympathy. ASP began this in-
vestigation. Miss Bielby complied
with Robinson's request for an
original bill.and checked wtth Mr.
Saimond of the Office of (irad uate
Studies and the (‘oIIcgcoI'SL Rose

father had some reason for paying
$60 less. that it must have been
what was owed according to the
bill that was sent at that time. As
the exchange of letters went on.
Robinson suggested possible ex-
planations for the 560.

He wrote Miss Bielby and told
her that the problem might result
from the fact that he was “farmed
out" asa Grad Student Assistant to
the College of St. Rose. This
reporter called the College of St.
Rose; they paid Robinson by
check.

At another point. in late
November. Mr. Robinson wrote
toMr. Page again. suggesting that
the  State Scholar Incentive
Aitiird may account for the $60 in
question. Miss Biclby the same day
sent an itenii/ation of Robinson's
account of that semester to him
and Mr. Page. Mr. Robinson

spoke to Page alter reccitiiig this

Almost incredible is the fact that in

children's eyes were scarred by
“playful” toy instruments such as

and pea shooters. It was in an effort
to halt these senseless tragedies
that NYPIRG at SUNYA under-
took Its ﬁrst research project.

In three weeks following a
successful 5000 name petition drivc
NYPI RU students completed their
first Public Interest Research Pro-
ject - an extensive survey of harm-
dons toys in the Capital District
department stores. The project. un-
questionably successful and
finalized last month. was in-
strumcnlal in affecting immediate
action against violators of illegal
toys through publication of their
results iirid indirect legal pressure.

[he Albany toy survey was com-
piled by 25 student researchers
from Albany State University and
Sicna College. covered 20 different
name department stores. and took
only one \tcck_io coiiiplcic. ('oor—

Many managers. when ﬁrst
notified of their violations. ad-
mitted that they were aware of the
violations before the students had
told them so.

The reason NYPIRGaiSUNYA
chose this project reﬂects the im-
portance of it as not only a serious
metropolitan problem but a widely
unrealized national one as well. As
stated in NYPIRG's ﬁnal report:
“The United States Public Health
Service has esti

  

year 700.000 children are injured
by toys. Approximately l}2.000 at
these injuries require treatment in a
hospital emergency iooni...injurics
range from common lacerations to
