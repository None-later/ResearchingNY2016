Welfare Reforrns Proposed

The Temporary State Commis-
sion to Revise the Social Services
Law has recommended sweeping
changes to untanglcand streamline
social services and welfare
programs. Estimates that welfare
and social services will cost tax-
payers more than $4 billion an—
nually by l974, prompted the
Commission's proposals for
rcmcdial measures.

Senator William T. Smith. ll.
stated that: “The recommen-
dations of the Commission are not
put forth for the sake of change
alone. but in thc sincch conviction
that the State has now reached a
point where it must resume its role
as paccmakcr for the nation-
innovatingat a timcwhcn innova-
tion is a ncccssily. and raising its
creative insights to point the way
toward a newer and more effective
system ol'dclivcring social services.

The Commission recommends
an cnd to our present welfare
system which commingles financial
aid programs. medical assistance
programs, and various social scr-
viccs activities; and further divides
administrative and supervisory
functions between local and state
authorities.

Legislation will be introduced
ncxt week which would place full
responsibility for thc administra-
tion of public assistance and
Medicaid on the Statc IchI undcra
IJinsion of I‘inancial and Mcdicai
Assistancc within the Exccutivc
Dcpartmcnt.

Scnutor Smith said that:

"By placing full responsibility on
thc State. the present County ad-

    
 
 
 

ministrated. state-supcrmcd
welfare system. which .tIIU\\s
buckpassing and providcs n cout-
fortable means of cvadingaccorrn-
tability when things go niong.
would be eliminated."

It is further propost that \\lfIlltt
this Division two scparatc aan dis-
tinct departments be crcaiud for
Financial Assistance Admrnrxtra-
tion and Medical Assistance Ad-
ministration. The former \tould

Wilson Sends
Cautious Budget

by Glenn von Nostltz

' Governor Wilson sent the
legislature a record $9.38 billion
budget Tuesday that contained no
major spending initiatives or tax
relief. Most of the budget was
devoted to maintaining programs
begun by his towering predecessor.
Nclsonlockefeller .

In the field of cdurxition. the
budch proposed an increase of
SIX: million in aid to secondary
and elementary schools. but this
represents no real incrcasc, rcflcc-
ting only riscs in the costs ofcduca-
tion. I‘hc budget calls fora $587.9
million allocation to thc Strife Un-
ivcrsity of New York. I‘his would
allow operations to continue
basically at the prcs’cnt lcvcl with
some additional funding included
for dcvclopirrg [Empire State

_All in all. the budget from
vaiious Republican leaders was
very pasitive. and indicates that the
Governor should have little
problem getting the Republican
Committee called the budget a
“sincere. thoughtful and altogether
commendable plan for meeting the
most essential needs of our
citizens" and Assemblyman Joseph
D. Margiotta said the budget is “a
good one in its moderate and
responsible approach to
governmental spending."

There was. of course. deep
criticism from the Democrats.
They charged that the budget is
ovcroptimistic in its proposed
revcnuc estimates. and “unnacccp-
lablc in its proposed expen-
diturcs."

Most of the budget was inherited
from Nelson Rockclcllcr. Wilson
aides poinch out yesterday that
Mr. Wilson‘s own initiatives ac-
count for only 3 pcrccritol thc total
budch cost.

All in all. thc budget offended no

Duryea, Anderson Urge Aid Changes

by Robert Dechenl

The two most important men in
the New York State legislature told
a gathering of educators last week
that more government attention
must befocused on the prohiemsof

private colleges and universities in

the state.

Senate Majority Leader Warren
Anderson and Assembly Speaker
l’crry Duryca were two promi-
ncnt panelists at ti symposium on
the “Futurc of thc American
College" sponsored by Colgate Un-
iversity January |7th at the
Americana Hirth in Ncw York
City.

Duryca propost thc dcwlop-
mum of it ncw “meaningful
prirtncrsliip" bctwccn .xtatc and
private schools. wliilc .‘\ndcr.son
usde for a restructuring of thc
highcr education financing for-
niula so that privatc schools and
public schools would contpcli.‘
nrorc fairly for studcnts. Private
schools. be pointcd out. arc facing
a dcclinc in cnrollmcnls
bccatusc of compctuion from lhc
grant State and City Univcrsity
systcmk

Spccificrtlh. Andcrson said that
u rcrrScd \itltit‘lll aid program.
\\Iltt.‘Il would gi\c aid directly to
thcr studcni ruthcr than tli: lll sutu
tron. .ippcais to bc thc hcst tlIiCl'-
nutn c. l’rcscntly. about $50
miIIIon a _\t.'tll lb giicn du’cctly‘ to
prrvrrtc schools by thc slatc go\ cru—
incnt. and Aridcison says that this
figurc cannot climb much highcr.

 

increased direct aid to private in-
stitutions would necessitate
greater state control over private
operating procedures. which is
anathema to private school ad-
ministrators. The State. Anderson
said. "must prevent a school from
juggling its figures so that it can ‘rip
off the taxpayers."

According to the State Senator.
the advantages of giving aid to
private schools through direct stu-
dcnt aid includc freedom ofchoicc
for thc student. a stress ofqualily.
and the fact that such aid can be
directly geared to a student‘s nccd.
Student Association of the
Statc Univcrsity has taken a strong
stand against such a restructuring
of tlic aid program. sincc it would
in all likelihood bc couplcd with
grlcutly Incrcascd tuition at SUNY
schools. SASU officials hu\c cs-
pI’CSSL‘LI fcrir that the propost aid
to SUNY studcnts \uiuld not bc
:ibIc to co\cr tlic grczilly incrcrrscd
tuition costs. and that many pic—
.st'nl SUNY siudcnts would not bc
riblc to afford either a public or a
prurilc collcgc education.

 

Duryea said that thereare strong
indications that college enrollment
will contract in the late 1970‘s. ad-
ding: “it is expected that the
college going rate will stabilize in
conjunction with an absolute
decline in' the number of high
school graduates.“ All sectors of
higher education. he said. should
fall short of their enrollment goals.
with an absolute decline cn-
countcrcd by thc private colleges
tllld univcrsitics in the state.

Duryea Says

Spcakcr Duryca also called fora
rcstructuring of the student aid
program. although he introduced
no specific recommendations.
