More than l,000 people attend-
ed the New York State Conference
on Marriage and Divorce held at
the Commodore Hotel in New
York City this past weekend.
Sponsored by the New York State
Chapters of the National
Organization of Women (NOW),
the conference sought to
“challenge the existing order
through consciousness—raising.
education and legislative change."

Congresswoman Bella Abzug
opened the session. Hoping to
counter the‘ charge that the
women‘s liberation movement is
not concerned with housewives she
asserted that “it's time their work
be given dignity and their con-
tributions legal protection.“ Citing
statistics from a Chase Manhattan
Bank pamphlet. “What a Woman
is Worth.“ she criticized the es-
timated ﬁgure of$l§9.00 a week as
being insufﬁcient to live on. She is
sponsoring a bill in the State
Legislature calling for social
security beneﬁts for wives. widows
and divorcces.

A group of unidentiﬁed Women
in white masks and robes held a
public hearing to demonstrate

' against

 

Divorce, Aborﬁbn
Reform: NOW

the divorce dilemma.
Speaking about their own ex-
periences. they told the conference
of well paid cit-husbands eluding
child-support. court delays. red
tape. callous or bribed judges and
hustling lawyers.

Divorce reforms were called for.
as were reforms dealing with
marriage contracts. “the legal
model of the married woman.“ As
one participant remarked, the
deﬁnition of "model" is a “small
copy of the real thing.”

Thirteen workshops began
Saturday afternoon and continued
through Sunday. Some evolved
into gripe sessions and a series of
unburdencd confessions. others
became informative dialogues
between panelists and an audience.
Approaches varied from ineffec-
tive gestures of pacification to legal

debates.

The workshops unfolded a mul-
titude of problems. as well as a
search for their alleviation. High
on the list of complaints were the
“abismal ignorance“ of women in
general. the entrapment of the
model. married life-style. and the
inefficiency of the system in trying
divorce cases and enforcing
divorce decisions. Innovations
such as alternative life-styles.
homemaker compensation and in-
surance beneﬁts. pie-marital legal
education. and ante-nuptial con—
tracts, divorce centers. job train-
ing, ﬂexible and staggered work
hours, and children‘s representa-
tion in court aroused the most in-
terest and enthusiasm

Suggestions were made to
representatives ofStatc and Coun«
ty Bar Associations and courts to

amend present divorce practices
and procedures. Feedback. from

'ihe workshop data" will be

channeled to develop guidelines for
future NOW sponsored marriage
and divorce programs.

Speciﬁc bills proposed before
the state legislature deal with
property holdings. forced financial
disclosure. legal use of a woman‘s
maiden name, separation
agreements including t h e
educational support of
dependents and the rights of par-
ties in an action for divorce.

Closing speeches by State
Senator Mary Anne Krupsak and
feminist Betty Friedan urged
women to face up to realities and
responsibilities. Senator Krupsak
spoke of the crime of public “in-
difference“ to a legislative com-
mittee system in which “the power
of the committee chairman is un~
ilateriil." Friedan encouraged
everyone concerned to band
together and to set up divorce
clinics similar to the existing abor—
tion clinics that were fought for in
previous years.

As to the renewed abortion con-
troversy. announcements werc
made about future protests in
Albany and in New York City.

of fried chicken fame is in a linger
licking bad mood.

The 83-year-old colonel is \‘cry
upset with the Heublein Company»
so upset. in fact. that he has ﬁled it
$122 million (dollar) law suit
against Heublein.

The Heublcin Company rcccnth
bought up the coloncl‘s Kentucky
Fried Chicken outlets around lllt'
world. and began doing things
their own way. l‘hc Colonel tip-
parcntly is not impressed with lllt'
changes at all.

In his multi-inillion dollar \ttll.
the Colonel contends that the coin
pany is using his name and llllttgt‘
to market all kinds ol newliinglcd
things lrom pastries to drum
products. The Colonel insists lll-ll
