Hear Today, Gone Tomorrow?

Hugh Scott, and after hitherald Ford, have stated that they know of evidence
President Nixon has in his possession that would prove hisinnocence in Watergate
and its subsequent cover-up. Mr. Scott has claimed that he actually has seen this
evidence, while Mr. Ford has stated that he has not had time to review it. They con-
tend that while this material would completely exonerate the President, they do not
feel it proper to release it to the public. Yet the large amount of material released thus
far has tended to prove to to be damaging to the President‘s cause, thus it is very dif-
ficult to accept the idea that Mr. Nixon would refuse to release more material.
material which, if his spokesmen are to be believed, would save his Presidency. The
simple statement by the Vice-President that he has “not had the time“ to look at the
material is also incredible. The fact that the Nixon Administration is in trouble can—
not be disputed; could Mr. Ford possibly consider such documents so unimportant
as to leave them for when he can make time for them?

An aide to the President stated yesterday that Mr. Nixon intends to“fight like hell"
against impeachment. To release testimony which supposedly would contradict what
John Dean has said and which would remove doubts as to the President‘s innocence
(as they have been removed from Mr. Scott and Mr. Ford) could very welldcstroy
any impeachment attempts. Indeed. Mr. Nixon might not have to “fight like hell“ at
all. as his opponents might be forced to completely'acquiesce in the face of such new
evidence. But that evidence is not forthcoming: the President seems to have chosen a
strange manner of lighting.

But perhaps the President is simply considering the other material on Watergate
that he has released. First. the disclosure that two tapes were missing; more recently.
a third has been shown to have been. in part. deliberately erased. Those Were also ap-
parently meant to exonerate the President; the conSCqucnces of releasing even more
tapes. when considering the fate ofthe others. may be grave. Perhaps portions of new
tapes have been doctored to prove the President‘s innocence. and the Administration
is worried that tape experts willdetect that also. Perhaps no material exists at all. and
the President is attempting one last defense while the Judiciary Committee considers
his impeachment.

’l‘he willfull destruction of the eighteen. minutes of tape. PIUS Mt“. Nixon's IaCk 0f
evrdence. or unwillingness to release such cvrdence to prove his innocence makes it
appear even more likely that he is involved in Watergate or its cover-up. Without a
full airing of the facts. the public can now never be convinced of the President‘s
professed ' uiltlessncss. Such a disclosure would occur only if the President is im-
peached. I impeached, there can belittle doubt that the President will release all
papers that might prove his innocence. or else that the public will know that he cannot
do so. Until then. the Nixon Ad ministration‘s conductofthc entire affair makes it in-
creasingly difficult to grant the customary status of innocent until provcn guilty

Benezet to the Rescue

To the Editor:

I would like to express my thanks to Presi-
dent Benezet for the prompt action and deep
interest in the fate of Donald Van Clcvc and
Frederick Munro. the sons of Prof. Donald
Van Cleve. Foundations of Education. and
Prof. Edwin Munro. Hispanic Studies. His
action showed deep concern for the welfare
of both of these individuals in a time ofdirc
need. His concern was comforting and
refreshing to both Fred and Don‘s parents
and friends. Dr. Benezet's prompt and
responsible action shows the need. and the
existence of. each individual‘s concern for
his fellow man iii our academic comntunity.

Don and Fred were adrift in a Hawaiian
fishing vessel for almost two months after
experiencing engine failure. Rcccntly they
were found after drifting about two lliou~
sand miles south-west of Honoltilu. their
point of departure. Dr. Benc/ct was iii-
strumental in obtaining the services of
(jovcrnor Rockefeller‘s ollicc which helped
in obtaining a search for the missing vessel.
the forty -seven foot Kamokila. It was part-
ly through his efforts that the appropriate
agcitcies performed lengthy searchcs. which.
although unsuccessful. were the most we
could hope for here in Albany.

I respectfully thank him for his prompt
rind most valued action in this matter.

of ii social norm). This offsets the “Ideal
Norm vs. the Cultural Norm" controversy.
where some tolerence of dcviancy from the
ideal norm is allowed.

From this. we derive a simple sylloglsm
that proves dcviancy is violation of law. If
you use: A it! and ETC. therefore ATC. the
logical proof is noted. Deviance from law T
disorder. All disorder is illogical, Therefore.
dcvitiiicc is illogical. There it is! Deviance is
illogical because it produces disorder. There
tire two entities that define deviance:

I. Sell destruction

2. Anti-Social behavior

Deviance is not a drive because drives are
universal. l'hcrcforc not ullpeoplc conven
tlicir drives into deviant behavior. There has
to be it readiness to dcviate.

Sonic might consider that man‘s laws are
imperfect. and it's questionable as to
whether man‘s laws cannot be broken
without disorder. (laws such as riiniring it
stop sign or trafﬁc light with no oncoming
traffic). In such crises. this is not deviance birt
when deviance is replaced with sin. then sin is
dealt With accordingly by (iod's Law.
