 Professor Edward Cowley I

_ his hard to say whether it was the wind or
maybe yhe same time of the year. I woke up
thinking of Aschaffenburg and- wondering
why?

It was‘ back in I945, lwas on the way home
and on my way out of the infantry. I had 66
pointsﬁipoint for each month in service, two
points for each month overseas. ﬁve points,
for each battle star and decoration. and they r
all came to 66. Like hundreds of others with
about the same number of points: we had
just arrived at' this stagingarea, and we were

‘ from the tents. The Captain then announced

 

 

that from that time on there would be’a
twenty-four :hour guard on' thé latrine.
Another thing about Sergeants is that'they
did not do guard duty. so the responsibility
for protecting the toilet tissue fell on the few
of us who werestill quaslified for that kind of
work.Thal evening a Sergeant came into our
tent and told me that l was latrine guard
from 2 a.m. to 4a.m. Later that night. it was
probably 2 a.m.. an armed soldier shook my
sleeping bag and said it wastime. Now. lwas
warm and sound asleep and dreaming about
art or girls or other good things. The

 

standing in wavy lines in front ofa captain
who was talking about the routine we were to

follow each day. We were at the Aschaffen-
burg military airﬁeld and it had been heavily  e    
bombed. It was cold and desolate and windy, y 0 O O

and inside the nearby tents it wasjust as cold

Aschitffenburg latrine was not on my mind
at all. The soldier had a flashlight and the
beam jumped all over the dark green
pyramiid walls.He flashed it in my eyes;
“You awake?“ lassured him I was and told
him not worry. lwould watch thetissue. He
left and I pulled up the zipper and went back

 

and only slightly less windy.
I wasn't really listening to the Captain. but
then suddenly his face was in front of mine.

 

Times have changed so much, it probably has

no relevance at all to what we do today

 

 

 

 

He seemed very intense in the early dawn.
and he said. “Where is your hat soldier?“ At
first l thought he was concerned about the
cold. and I reached to my head to see if my
woolen hat was there; then he shouted.
“Don‘t moicl" However. I had already
touched my hat. and so I knew it was there.
He repeated. “Where is your hat soldier?"
and in a liiirly courteous military manner I
replied. "My hat is on my limit]. Sir." Iliad rto
idea why we were doing this. the war was
over. and we had \von.and l really wanted to
go back to lluffalo to see nty lriends. llut
then after a pause and a pattern ol frowns. he
screamed. "That is not a hat!“ Now. we had
never met bclorc. and ltliouglii it wasri rude
wriy' ol trtlking about someonc's hat. illltl I
didn't ktiow what he wanted or why. It was
my turn to speak. so lsaid in a less courteous

 

way. "My hat isa hat.Sir.“ Then he shouted.

 

 

Like hundreds of others with
about the same number of points,
welhad just arrived at this staging area

 

'where garbage was dumped. Actually, we

“But it is not a helmet!" and ol course he was
right. it wasn't a helmet, As the warwas end-
ed. and the field hadn‘t been bombed in eight
months. it seemed safe not to wear a helmet.
but he made me promise never to show uprtt
it lortnarron Without my proper hclinet.and I
agreed he was right. and wrili one final tern»
ble glance he moved on down the litie to see
wliai else he could do as Captain.

We returned to the cold damp tents. and I‘
sat on a cot rind said. “Jesus Christ. where
did they lind that son of ii bitch'r‘ We had‘
been assigned at random to tents. so thoscl
came with Irom the 94th Division were
scattered all ovcr,aiid we weierrll riowa part
of the lilltli l)i\iston. llierc were guys in my
rent from (icrirgra and Alabama. and we
talked about ilic ()kclcnokec swamps and .i
deliglitlul ethic that this one lellow kcpi
repeating. "It doesn't count it you're dr link!“
We drank some schnapps or something that
was warm. and then the whistle blew, and we
went out to another formation and another
session with our leader.

This time he had a plan. and l. of course.
had my helmet. lie was going to keep us
busy, and we were not to go into town and
were ordered to stay on the bombed-out air-
field. I was on the squad chosen tyo improve
the sump holes. We got shovels, and after
breakfast headed to a far end of the airstrip

 

had more holes lor duriiping than you ever
saw, [here were Still-pound holes and lllll-
pound holes and assorted holes of many
other botiib st/es, However. it bomb iiiitkeszt
round hole. and the army says that sump
holes should be square. It was our job to
rtiakc the round holes square. and this we did
day alter day. It took a long tiriie because
there were orin twoworked. It was difficult
to amass on poitits and not be a Sergeant. so
almost everyone was it Sergeant cxcept
another fellow tltltl me. Sergeants did riot
work on menial tasks. so ilic twriol us work—
ed aiid the rest watched and stiiokcd and now
and then talked about the Captain.

It doesn't embarrass the to not have been ii
military leader. lhere are many coin—
plicitttoris. but I the simplest leiiiis. lwasjusl
the right age to he in many ol the wrong
places. and II was bad iii those places lor
both the leaders and the led. Actually. this is
part of what at times has been a bigger
problem. I have discovered that lam even
less of a follower than it leader. This has been
a personal dilemma with which lliave had to
contend.

Back at Aschallenburg. time passed and
somehow it got to be pay day. We were all in
a single line leading to the Captain's table.
and when it came our turn, each of us would
shout his name. and a couple other people
would write down sortie thingsnrnd then We |l

 

would leave. The Captain said. “Nitrite
soldier?" I said quietly btit firmly. “Cowley”;
he said. “l"ull name": I said “I dwrird
Cowley". he stood up and glared and said. "I
said your lllll name." Here we were again. tlic
inrtn witli the hut trick was at it otice more i

knew. why didn't he say so. lhcurrriy liztdun
expression crillcd red lined. and that‘s what
he did to Inc. It didn't really make much

    

to Buffalo or wherever I had been.

The next morning the Captain was frantic.
and at the first formation hc raged up and
down saying over and mer again. "’l'lie
guard was broken. the guard was hrokcn.
Who did this‘.’ Who was responsible“.' What
kind ol soldiers are you?“ 'I he thought
quickly occurred to me. and probably to
others, than il he kept pressing he might lc.irn

It was our job to make the round holes

square, and this we did day after day.
