Displaying what one
observer coined a.“.leckyll-
Hyde“ pattern of Basketball,
the Albany Great Danes sur-
pressed the latter style suf-
ficiently to defeat visiting
Marist College, 70-52, Tuesday
evening at University Gym.
However. the ﬁnal margin of
eighteen points should not
obscure the fact that for a
significant five minute period in
the first half. the Danes looked
sluggish and unorganized. and
actually were tied with Marist
when the first twenty minutes
had elapsed.

Coach Doc Sauers was
generally pleased with the
team‘s performance. s 'iting
that it was especially satisfying
that the offense Worked well
“even though the sltots weren‘t
going in.“ However. he cottld
come up with no explanation
for the quick turn of events
wliiclt enabled Marist to out-
score the Danes ll-2 dtiring
one stretch. a stretch which has
become too familiar as far as
this year is concerned.

 

the Danes began slowly.
dropping behind l4-7 before
they finally regrouped behind
some excellent team play. led
by Byron Miller. who topped
all scorers with twenty points.
Urged on by the crowd. which
was far less than capacity.
Albany State tightened up on
defense and moved in front. I8-
l6. 1n the next five minutes the
Danes extended their lead to
nine points at 29-20 and gave
indications of a possible rout.

However. “Mr. Hyde" triok
over at this stage and sudden ly
it was tied at ll. the Danes iii-
explicably unable to move the
ball and slackening a bit on
defense Ron (ilackin of Marist
scored all six of his points in

 
  
 
 
    
  
    
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
    
  
   
  
  
  

 

 

 

this period, coming off the
bench to spark the team. Fora
period of approximately three
minutes the Albany State
players seemed completely
mesmerized, particularly Ed
Johnson, who scored just six
points in the game and “forced
the play" according to Sauers.

Whatever Doe Sauers ex-
pounded to his players during
halftime obviously brought
them out of their hypnosis. as
they quickly jumped out to a
six-point lead and were never

. headed. Significantly. Ed John-
stilt did not start the second
half. as Gary 'l‘revctt and Mike
Supruuowic/ worked the
backcourt.

Marist began forcing sltots as
the Dane defense continually
pressured the visiters into mis-
takes. Albany‘s jumping ability
also reappeared. as they out-
rebotiiided their opponents 2‘)-
2f) in the second half. for a 52-
49 edge overall, Harry John-
son. although off from the field,
grabbed off twelve rebounds.
high for the Danes. Forward
Joe Cirasclfa of Marist took
game rebound honors with
seventeen.

As the second half progress—
ed the Danes slowly built up
their lead. not on superior
offensive prowess (the shootirtg
being poor). but by virtue ofthe
defense. which limited the
equally poor-shooting Marist
team to just 2| points in the
final 20 minutes. With just over
five minutes to go, wltat is
generally known as “garbage
time“ became a reality. where
everyone is given a chance to
play and things usually get pret-
t) sloppy. liven freshman Mel
lh‘own got into the act. and
althouin he failed to score. the
crowd went wild as it driving

NYPIRG Compiles Albany-Wide Gas Prices

by Dan Gaines

A group of SUNYA NYPIRG
students went to more than two-
tliirds of Albany‘s gas stations this
past weekend checking prices and
conformity to the Cost of Living
Council‘s Phase IV posting re-
quirements. They found
differences of as muclt as l3 e per
gallon between gas stations selling
the same grades of gasoline.

“It: purpose of this NYPIRG

project was to make sure that con-
sumers weren‘t being overcharged.
to make sure gas stations had their
stickers out. and to make it possi-
ble for consumers to know where
they can get the best gas at the best
price.

l'he N Yl’l RG people went to 65
stations altogether. virtually rill of
them within Albany‘s city limits.
