One Year Trial Student Judiciary

by Larry Kraftolwitz (SASU)

A uniﬁed Student-Wide
Judiciary. intended as a major step
toward due process and the ad-
vancement of student rights, has
been approved for one year by
SUNY-Buffalo President Robert
Kctter.

Beginning this semester. the stu-
dent court. the ﬁrst ever to encom-
pass graduate. undergraduate and
night students. will hear cases in-
volving Violations ofnon~academie
conduct regulations and will have
the power to impose punishments
and various “losses of privilege
consistent with the offense com-
mitted."

Unlike its predecessor. a
skeleton student judiciary con-
sisting of five undergraduate
representatives. the Student-Wide
Judiciary will be composed of Ill
judges representing the irri—
dergraduatc. Graduate and
Millard Fillmore College Student
Associations. Each case will first be
heard by a panel of tlireejirdgcs.
tyvo of them front the defendant‘s
constituency. Defendants will be
able to appeal decisions to another
three-judge panel. again with two
judges from the defendant‘s con.
stituency and the third judge lront
the constituency excluded at the
tirst leyel. Finally, the defendant
may appeal to a “Supreme Court"
consisting of the chiefjudgc and a
just e from each of the other two
constituencies.

“ l he Student-Wide .ludiciary is
a complete judicial system iri-

The concept of aStudent-Wide
Judiciary had its roots in I969.
when Dr. Stein perceived the need
for an “umbrella“judiciary system
to deal with conflicts among stu-
dent governments, as well as those
between them. After four years of
deliberation with numerous stu-
dent leaders. Dr. Stein submitted a
linal proposal to President Kettcr
last May.

After extensive scrutiny by John
I. *ach. attorney for Dr. Kctterand
Walter Rolihan. the State State
University of New York (SUNY)
Vice Chancellor forLe alAl'friirs.
a revised resolution was sent brick
to Dr. Stein

the student governments had
originally sought the right to sub-
poena any member ofthe Universi-
ty community. including lactrlty.
stall and students and the right to
line anyone who i'elused to comply
with the stibpoena. according to
SA Stirdciit Rights Coordinator
(‘lill l’aletsky. llowcycr. a clrirrsc
was later discovered in the lllll\t.'l'-
sity‘s contract with the Senate
l’i'olcssional Association which
restricted students from hearing
misconduct charges against laculty
members.

the Judiciary charter was thus
airiciided sooiily sludcntswotrld be

ed to comply with a subpoena. llie

semester. Although no litres exist
for faculty members. the judiciary
can enforce faculty subpoenas by
appealing to Dr. Keller.

Another area of dispute conv
cerned Dr. Stein' and the student
governments‘ insistence that a
defendant must. be found gtiilty
“beyond a reasonable doubt."
Although Mr. Leach strongly
recommended that this wording be
changed to read “substantial
evidence." the terminology was left
unchanged at Dr. Stein‘s urging.
l'liis yvotrld give students the
beitclit of the doubt. since they
were the ones most oftcr on trial

“clcctcd otlicials. cycr sensitive to

more than scllscrying rhetoric and

7) Fair Political Practice: - A
state agency speciﬁcally charged
with enforcing these reforms.

Each legislator has been asked
where he stands doncerning these
reforms and his or her response will
be recorded in the study. No con-
cerned legislator has a valid reason
for not cooperating with our ef-
torts. 'l'hrce preliminary letters of
explanation and a questionnaire
were mailed to all Senators and
Asscrnblyinen before the study
began. because PIRG does not
ascribe to any political position.
does not threaten any man‘s con—
yietions. but rather hopes to
