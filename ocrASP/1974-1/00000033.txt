Goodman Urges Housing Freeze End

State Senator Roy M. Goodman
(R-L, Manhattan), Chairman of
the New York State Senate Com-
mittee on Housing and Urban
Development last week urged an
immediate and total end to the
current freeze on federally spon-
sored housing programs.

In their discussions with
members ofCongress. the New Yrk
delegation reviewed the principal
community development and
housing bills pending in the House
and Senate. The delegation
cmphasi/cd that it is essential for
New York as well its othcr major

sharply critici/cd the current freeze
on cxisting housing subsidy
programs and thc impoundmcnt of
lunds allocated to subsidy
programs by (‘ongrc. . Ihc
legislators pointcd out that thc rc-
ccnt rclcasc by HUD of sonic
fro/en funds was inadcquatc and

 

jsame age while. in fact, actuarial
' data show the difference should be
at least six years.

“As chairman of the Insurancc
Committee, I have instituted stall
research into this problem ofdis-
crimination and have discovered
many abuses. Women who rrrc

pool and forced to pay exorbitant
premiums and. at the same time.
are denied the right to pay by in-

after years ofaccidcnt-frcc drn ing.
