Between Nothingness and Eternity

by K.M. Daniels

“Between Nothingness and Eterni~
ty“

Barren of events.

Rich in pretensions

My earthy life.

Obscurity
My real name.

Wholly onto myself
I exist.

I wrap no soul

In my embrace.
No mentor worthy
Of my calibre
Have I.

l ant all alone
Between failure
And frustration

I aiii the red tltread

Between notlringness

And eternity .

(from "My I-lirte" by Sri Chin»
nioy)

 

The Mahuvishu Orchestra have
a strong track record as a live
group as well as being a fine studio
machine. And here in “Between
Nothingness arid Eternity" (KC
32766) we are lirially presented the
Mahavislinu Orchestra the on
album. l‘he concert was recorded
on an August Day in New Yorks
Central Park iirid has some excep-
tionally strong sottrid in its laior
fora live album.

The group. still intact at tltis
time, has captured their brand of
performance well here on this
recording. The album was
engineered by l‘irn (icclan. arid it
contains the Mahavishtiu we are so
very familiar to. Possibly the loci
that the orchestra is recording in an
opeti air atmosphere adds to the
unrestrained freedom of mine-
tiierit arid feeling ol the album.
