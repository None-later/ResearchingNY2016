' Cagers Lasers To Geneseo, Buffalo

by Doug Lewanda

The Albany Great Dane varsity
basketball team took their extend-
ed western New York road trip this
past weektfnd. and there is perhaps
only one word which could
describe the results of their travels -

i - DISASTER.

Friday night in Geneseo. the
Danes were demolished by an un-
derrated. but superior Blue Knight

squad. as Geneseo walked away -

with the contest, 93-7I. Reggie
Smith had started things on the
right note for Albany. as he con-
verted a three point play to open
the game. giving Albany the early
lead. However. it was all Geneseo
from that point. as the Blue
Knoghts completely dominated
play/in all departments.

The first half was rather un-
eventful as Geneseo managed to
maintain a thirteen point bulge
throughout most ofthe period and
the Knights went into the locker
room at half time witha 4I-28 lead.
Harry Ward was the star of the
game for Geneseo. as he netted 24
points and grabbed l| rebounds.
lohn Robota also contributed in
the winning cause with 22 points
.irid sixteen rebounds of his own.
Albany knew that it was not going
to be an easy task beating Geneseo.
or U.B. the next night for that
matter. especially after finding out
that freshman guard Mike
Suprunowicx would not be in un-
iform for the weekend games. He
came down with a bout of the flu
and did not suit up for the contests.

With a second half to play. the
Danes still had a chance to make it
a contest. However. the combina-

and the absolutely frigid shooting
of Albany State made the game a
runaway. The fact that Byron
Miller hit only one basket in that
. second half more or less told the
story. Thus. with about twelve
minutes remaining and the game
completely out of hand - Geneseo
had amassed their biggest lead of
the evening at 27 points. 84-57 - it
was time for Coach Doc Sauersto
get a good look at his substitutes.
namely Mel Brown. Pete Koola.
Harold Merritt. and the newest
member. Felton Hyche.

A couple of interesting notes
regarding the game: Ed Johnson
topped all Albany scores with to
pts.. followed by Smith and
Merritt who had fourteen. Yet.
most of them came in that high
scoring second half. when the game
was out of reach. Miller added only
nine. and Harry Johnson tossed in
but four. But perhaps the biggest.
or smallest statistic of all was the
fact that (iary 'l‘rcvettdid not score
at all. All in all it wasa lostevening
for Albany who now have a
SU NYAC league record of l -2. Yet
the team would not have enought
time to think about it because they
had another game to play the

consistently from all spots on the
floor. and passing like they should.
'Albany accumulated a 44-35 half
time lead. The excellence of the
first half was proven by the
statistics. as not less than four
players. Johnson and Johnson.
Smith and Koola poured in eight
points apiece in the stanza.

The contest started slowly, with
each team using a controlled wait-
for-the-open-man-to-shoot type
offense. Then things began to pick
up as the action was non-stop from
end to end. as the teams were
trading baskets. and the lead. The
Danes at one point were down by
six. at 24-l8. but a couple of fast
breaks and uncontested layups saw
Albany erase that deficit and in fact
take a nine point halftime bulge.
Albany needed a win here. not only
because it would salvage the road
trip and get them back on the right
track. htit their opponent. SUNY

toughest opponents over the years.

lhe second half started just like
the first. except for the fact that
Albany waited for Buffalo to make
the first move. With the lead and
the ball. the Danes were content to
hold on as long as possible. before
putting it up for grabs. This
strategy was costly as Buffalo
waited for Albany‘s missed shots.
and then proceeded to come down
court and score themselves. Allofa
sudden. an ll pt. lead had
dwindled to five. and this set the

   

 

tone of play for the last fifteen
minutes of the game. Horace
Brawlcy. one ofonly two returnees
from last year‘s squad. and Otis
Horne (both substitutes). were
responsible for this sudden change
of events. as the pair controlled
both the offensive and defensive
boards. Not to be outdone. both

still had the ball. A very successful
stall proved to be the margin ol'vic-
tory for the Bulls. lhc Danes had
