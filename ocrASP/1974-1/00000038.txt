,Adelphi University is in' the

midst of a student-faculty rights.

controversy involving a document
which gives students the power to
recommend faculty censure.

The Adelphi Student Judicial
System Act, which went into effect
on September 6, I973, was
presented to the University Coun-
cil by Kay Kimmell, associate
professor of Business Administra-
tion. last May. Asadopted, the Act
allows (faculty members to bring
students before the Grievance
Hearing Board and. also allows
students to take “unfair grade com-
plaints" to the court.

Adelphi's new judicial system
givesstudents-for the ﬁrst time-the
power to recommend the censure
of faculty members. The censure.
which has to be approved by a ma-
jority vote. could be included in the
faculty/member'spermanent record.

THE CURE with Charlie Chaplin

The censure provision of the Act
has outraged several Adelphi facul-
ty members. Dr. Donald Koster.
professor of English, cited the stu-
dent right to censure faculty as a
“violation of academic freedom”
arguing that a teacher‘s obligation
is to evaluate the work ofstudents.
“This is part of one's freedom as a
teacher...Who is qualiﬁed tojudge
between teaching practices'r‘asked
Koster. He warned that the threat
of censure might pressure some
teachers into giving students higher
grades.

Dresden said that there are
reasons professors should be sub-
iected to censure. especially for
failing to attend classes. But. he
also said that if it teacher repeated-
ly gives low grades to students. and
these grades are contested, then, it
may be cause for censure. “It

 

depends on how structured the

courses are." he said. "I think
students should have some means
of recourse.“ Dresden addedthat
the Grievance Committee is work-
ing on the problem.

Included in the Act, at Adclphi,
is a provision that enables the court
to require a faculty member to
apologize to a student whose rights
have been viloated. “And as for the
requirement for a faculty apology
to a student. that is unheard of!“
said Koster. He added that
students, due to their non-
profcssional background. are not
will qualified to judge faculty
members.

“I think the University Council
has exceeded its authority in ap-
proving this aet...." said Koster.
He has recommended that the
document be reviewed by the
Faculty Scnrtte.

Although the Faculty Senate has
not taken action on the censure
provision. its liy-l.aws Committee
on the Student Judicial System is

l‘hc rnticli debated arms control
issue will once rigriiii be under the
spotlight when the University
Senate reconveiieson Monday. At
the riicctiiig the arms control bill
presented by the University C‘om—
munity (‘ouncil will be up for
debate.

The bill that is to be the subject
ol'disciission at the Senate ntecting
on Monday concerns itself with
five main questions:

I) Whether there is an ap-
parent need for selected firearms
usage on campus,

2) Whether the conditions un-
der which ﬁrearms may be carried
by Campus Police Officersas listed
in present policy are appropriate
and adequate.

3) Whether the training given
to the Campus Police in the use of
lir'irr‘ms is adequate.

4) Whether the provisions for
carrying and iisrigc of firearms rirc
rippr'opr'irite.ririd

5) Whether the proyisions lor
rcyreyy ol action inyoly irrg ﬁrearms
and appropriate record and report
are adequate.
