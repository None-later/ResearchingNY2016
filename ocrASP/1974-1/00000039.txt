Council Debates Miami, Tokens

by Andy Rat'kin

lnaslough ofchaoticparlitimen-
tary procedure. Central Council
debated much. but resolved littleat
this Wednesday‘s meeting. Oneof
the tltrec major actions undertaken
was in response to students’ com-
plaints concerning the recent
procedures employed by class and
Council officers in the ticket sale
for the Miami trip.

Cateringtostudentswhoattcnd-
ed the meeting to voice their an-
noyance. the agenda was suspend-
ed to expedite discussion on the
Miami ticket issue. S.A. Vice-
l’resident Harry Davis explained
that although it was originally
believed that S.A. would subsidi/c
the newly chartered buses to allow
a contintiance ol the discount
price. S.A. later realized it was un-
just to fund a Junior-senior spon-
sored trip with student tax money
collected lr'orn the university at
large.

FREE ADMISSION

-O---------

 

It was pointed out that no dis-
ciplinary action could bi.- taken
against the class officers who
reserved 3| tickets for themselves
and their friends since the classes of
‘74-‘75 did not have a constitution
on file. Nevertheless. the ad hoc
committee is scheduled to issue an
investigative report in one week.

In other major action. the
proposed Riding Club budget was
defeated by a 5-l3-2 vote after
weeks of petitioning for money by
the group‘s representatives. Stacey
Frank represented the group and
argued for the institution of a
Riding Club at SUNYA. But the
Council was somewhat hostile to
her cause. with Rich Gordon
leading a fight against the propos-
ed club. He blasted the exorbitant
cost of $55 per person needed to
linanccthe clirb (the total proposed
budget was $|.l52) and cited that
the budget only allowed the clubto
scr\e twenty people in the entire
tiimersity.

Some members did feel Ms.
l-raiik‘s cause was duly loundcd.
howe\ei. since the Skydii irig Club
was landed with between $800»

storm per year and only ser\cd tit-
t)’ people. (iordon persisted. citing
the A.A.B.‘s refusal to finance the
club because of its limited
membership. Their refusal was

also based on the grounds that
since there were no home meets
planned. the club did not serve the
university community at large.

In a last plea. although hcrcause
seemed lost. Stacey Frank
emphasired that the cltib needed
more money per member than
other clubs. but that the club‘s
members also lityed out more cash
per person than members of other
clubs. After a motion to postpone
voting was defeated, the proposal
itself was voted down and Ms.
Frank and liercolleguc swiftly ex-
ited. obviously greatly perturbed.

A major political fire was later
stirred by the proposal of a bill in-
tended to restrict the influence of
the cxccurive branch. namely the
S.A. President and Vice-President.
in legislative Central Council af-
fairs. S.A. president Gerhcr‘s
absence ntade the bill‘s introduc-
tion interestingly timely.

lhe bill was proposed “because
of undue influence exerted by
members ol the executive branch
over Central Council decision." It
suggests a strident referendum be
taken to amend the constitution of
the Central Council so that the
phrase " l be president shall be an at
large. non-voting member of Ceri—
lral Council" be deleted, the
removal of this phrase would not

   

/\l .l‘i/\NY Li'l'lJDICN'l‘ l’lil'

 

give the president or the Vice-
presidnct voting power. On the
contrary. it would decrease their
prestige and influence on the
Council by making their political
status on the council negligible.

Debate on this subject was es-
pecially harsh. As procedure now
exists. the executive can initiate
bills and speak without a time limit
on their behalf.

l'ony Perez vehemently sup-
ported passage of the proposed
bill. Claiming that Gerber‘s infor-
mation was often unsubstantiated.
Perez felt that it was fine forthe ex-
ecutive to provide information to
the council. However, he stated
that.“whcn the executive guides the
mentality of the council that is not
separation of powers.“ Perez alleg-
cd that the council contained party
hacks who rubber stamped Ger-
ber‘s proposals. He cited six
proposals that Gerber advocated
and were immediately passed.

0n the other side of the issue. it
was pointed out that Gerber‘s bills
Were passed because they were well
argued and worthy of passing
regardless ol (ier'her's sponsorship.
A \ote to postpone discussion of
the bill was delcated 0-“); however.

The paper is expected to fold
