Barney Fowler, scourge of the
SUNYA public relations depart-
ment, is an old time Albany jour-
nalist who's been a constant critic
of what he sees as indecency. waste,
and I lack of discipline in
everything around him. He is well
known on this campus for his It-
tacks on the University. which he
has dubbed “Dirty Doodleland”.
He has criticized the alleged poor
behavior of students. and the sup-
posed waste and inefﬁciency in the
administration building. Fowler
has managed to attract a large and
devoted constituency through his
column in the Albany Times-
Union.

Barney Fowler has a desk at the
l'imcs Union but he only comes in
from three to about six every day.
He spends the time taking phone
calls. looking at his mail - he gets
about seven to eight thousand
letters each year from people
responding to his daily columns in
the "limes Union - and writing.
When I walked tip to his desk one
day last week and introduced
myself-we‘d madeanappointment
for three o’clock - he looked up and
said.

"You‘re on time."

We walked over to Fred

(CPS) The federal grand jury in-
vestigation into the fatal shootings
of four Kent State University
students over three years ago has
begun. During its initial meeting
last Decembera US District Court
judge charged the panel with
deciding whether there is probable
cause crimes had been committed
and whether indictments should be
returned.

The shootings occurred May 4.
I970 when National Guard troops
opened fire during a campus
demonstration against US military
involvement in Cambodia. leaving
four dead and nine wounded.

I'he federal grand jury is one
more milestone in the confused
and often anguished aftermath of
the tragedy which involved an
aborted investigatioti by an Ohio
grand jury. questionable decisions

A third question concerns the

Sylvester Del Corso. In related
suits lawyers oti behalf of three of
the dead students claimed that
these and other ()hio officials
willfully and malicioust conspired
to deprive the students of their
constitutional rights not to be
deprived of life without the due
process of law. according to Higher
[Li/llt'tlfftlll Hui/r (HE/J).

Assistant Attorney General J.
Stanley l’ottinger. head of the
Justice Department‘s (‘ivial Rights
division and the man in charge of
the investigation leading to the im-
parielirig of the grand jury. said in
November the “primary focus" in
calling a grand jury would be “to

because it cart order witnesses to
testify under oath and thus hold
them liable to perjury charges if
they lie.

and returned 1‘ indictments

SUNDAY I2 -

(CPS) It‘s a bad year for college
and university faculty. All over the
country at large state universities
and small state and private colleges
faculty members are receiving
some termination notices.

Some of the schools that have
cut back faculty effective im-
mediately or in June include: Kent
State University. 25 faculty
members: Southern Illinois Un-
iversity (SIU). l04; University of
Wisconsin system, 85; Antioch
College in Ohio. 33: West Georgia
College. 24; Westcrn Washington
State College. l00. .tentatively;
Mankate State College in
Minncsta 3: and Southwest
Minnesota State College. l3.

l‘bis is by no means a complete
list nor does it include the many
schools that are considering faculty
cutbacks. that have not replaced
teachers who have retired or
resigticd or Irave put full time facul-
ty members on part time status.

Althouin declining enrollments
and lower budgets seemsto justin
some of the cutbacks many dis—
missed faculty members and the
American l’edcralion of ’I'eachers
say that schools bare become over-
/c:iloiis about cost accountability.
blindly alideiiiig to arbitrary stu—
dent teacher ratios set by
legislatures. trustees and con-
sttlrnig Iiirns. Many schools are

As Enrollment Declines

hours nevertheless had faculty cut-
backs.

Enrollment has declined l0 per
cent over the past two years at Kent
State and university president Dr.
Bernard Hall estimated the faculty
cuts will save the university $224.—
800. plus l5 per cent in fringe
beneﬁts.

Faculty are unitingand confron-
ting administratorswith demands
for full information on university
-— wide funding. for corrrespon-
ding cuts in administrative salaries
and personnel (which few schools
have considered). for cuts in non —
academic areas and student ser-
vices. and above all for adequate
faculty participation in the
decisions regarding their jobs.

Students at Kent State are con—
ccrned because it has become a cer-
tainty that some non w traditional
curriculum including the Center
for Peaceful Change. an outgrowth
of the Kent State killings; the
Center for Urban Regionalism and
the Institute for Afro American
Affairs. will be eliminated by the
cutbacks.

I'Ire |U4 firings at SIU have
become a complex eourt affair. In
addition to firing the teachers. the
administration filed a class action
