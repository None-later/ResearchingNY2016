Governor Malcolm Wilson held
a press conference Wednesday
morning and told reporters that he
will do everything possible to
assure that workers losing their
jobs because ofthe energy crisis are
fully compensated with unemploy-
incnt payments. Wilson also stated
that he is setting up an office of fuel
and energy in the cxccutivcdepart-
ment of the state government.’

the press conference was
basically a routine affair. with no
other major revelations. Wilson
did say. however that he fully in-
tends to ltold a “full term" in the

Shock Probation
Measure Urged

A bill permitting the use of so-
callcd "shock probation“ in senten-
ciitg relatively minor criminal
offenders has been introduced by
Senator .losepli R. l’isaiii (R-

(I Ross tR.-West.).

"Shock ptohation" is a system
which periiitts the sentencing |udgc

It tltcrcby allows the court to te—

tool in promoting the rehabilita-

Under this concept. a judge might

the (iovcrnor also talked about
his proposal to move the state
nominating conventions to June;
from March. and also to change
the date of the state primaries.
Wilson said that he wants the con-
vention dates moved because “I
don‘t want it held during the
legislative session. since there are
already too many pressures on
legislators." Wilson also does itot
want to see a “long dragged out
campaign."

Wilson also told newsmen that
there are no state plans. such as
