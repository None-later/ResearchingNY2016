Winﬁeld as the parents of the boy
(Kevin Hooks). They give us a new
legendary image of beloved
parents. self-sadriﬁcing but not
cloying. Miss Tyson is quite
fabulous (she was nominated for

best actress at the Academy.

Awards. as was Paul Winﬁeld for
best actor. and she won the Best
Actress award from The National
Society of Film Critics). She
doesn‘t get a “big”'scene in any
customary sense. but she‘s such a
charged and intelligent presence.
so splendidly in tune with the
character she playsthat you can‘t
take your eyes off of her.

She looks startlingly thin and
gaunt. like a woman prematurely
aged by hard work and privation.
and she endows this mother with
bedrock reserves of pride, love and
toughness that are truly in-
spirational. ‘

Winﬁeld seems to overdo the
hearty. virile. laughing father at
first. but one accepts the
preparatory conceit when he
returns. an injured and subdued
man but still a loving. emotionally
unbroken man. His climactic scene
at the riverbank with Kevin Hooks.
is one of the most touching things
you‘ll ever see.

The ﬁlm title may be a minor
hang-up. Sounder is the name of
the family‘s coon dog. who is
maimed by a shotgun blast from a
deputy at the time of the father‘s
arrest. Sounder doesn't develop as

a child-loves-animal'picture. and
the ﬁlmmakers fail to exploit the
dog's symbolic importance; that is
to link his hardiness and endurance
to that ofthe father, the family. and
the race.

Suunderis presented by Albany
State Cinema this Saturday even-
ing. Because of the great demand
for this film. the group has chosen
to increase the number ofshowings
from two to three. and they urge all
to bring their tax cards. Sounder is
a distinctive ﬁlm—n family pic-
ture one can praise for its quality,
but expecially for its warm and
touching universal story.

Root or another volunteer reporter

coverage of local events ol'intcrcst

Iintidicnp. they do try to keep
posted on activity on Capitol Hill.

Althouglr Speak Out has passed
llli: time test ol'two years with it still
growing readership. it has not been
without its troubles. Because most
women who work on SpcrikOut tire
imohcd with women‘s liberation
groups. and because funding is
pi oyided by local feminist
orgnni/ntions. it is dilliciilt for the
pnpcr to be objective and critical.

. threatened to leave. Root explain-

ed that some women would not feel
comfortable with men in the room.
" this is it feminist paper.“

this is the reason for the jour-
nrrl‘s decision making policy-only
women may make decisions. Ar-
ticles contributed by men will be
considered by women. Root
believes “the Women‘s movement
got its bad name by the coverage of
the male press. The far-out and the
idiotic was emphasized. They
operate on the basic assumption
that although women ain't work.
their rent role is that of wife and
