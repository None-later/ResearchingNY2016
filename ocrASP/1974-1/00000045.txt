The Environmentalists

and the Energy Crisis

 

by Douglas LeComte

We wore little green American flags on
our car windows and we discovered a new
wordecologywhich most of us did not really
understand. but we knew it hounded
authoritative and it showed we cared about
the environment which was another word
which had that magic ring to it. Suddenly.
everybody was jumping overeverybod) 'o be
the ﬁrst in their neighborhoods to be known
as “environmentalists.”

And why not? The time was the l960‘sand
ﬁnally people were looking around at the
mess left in the streams. within the takes. on
the ground. and in the atmosphere and peo-
ple were deciding that the earth could not in-
deﬁnitely be used as a garbage dump.
Something had to be done to stop all this
pollution and more and more people were
jumping onto the ecology bandwagon.

The movement started out as a legitimate
protest against a serious problem. Rational
solutions were needed to begin to reversethe
trend towards dirty air and water. But then
something happened. The politicians saw a
way to cash in on a popular themcand pretty
soon it was seen that the way to win votes
was to think up “tough” and “uncom-
promising" laWs which would thwart the evil

designs of those wicked industrialists who
were. out to destroy us all. It did not matter
whether the laws were reasonable or even
workable. the people were asking for action
and to most politicians. that means passing a
law against something.

A senator from Maine who wanted to be
President devised the Clean Air Act. This
was one of the most unrealistic and un-
workabledaws to come out of Congress in
some years. which is saying a good deal, but
who would dare vote against clean air
anyways? Ecology. like safety, was becom-
ing a sacred cow.just like the Family and the
Flag in earlier times and few congressmen
would dare vote against a bill which
presumably would mean cleaner air. no
matter how ridiculous.

The bill set so-called cleanr air standards
for the country; standards which could not
be met with the existing technology. stan—
dards which were arbitrarily defined arid
standards which were totally unrealistic for
some p iris ot' the country. It was as though
Congr ss passed at law regulating the number
ol homicides and burglaries permissible itr
e.tcir city and state in the country. The cott-
grcssmen supporting such a bill might he
Iiai ed as champions of delusion which tltey
would really be.

 

 

 

The environment had been neglected

much too long but now the pendulum was
swinging too far in the other direction. Not
only would the politicintis beneﬁt by stumbl-
ing over each otherto see who could think up
the most anti-pollution bills, but the doom-
sayer crowd would profit. the religious nuts
would be given added impetus, the anti-
capitalist mentality would be fueled. the fad-
dists' numbers would no enlarged and all
these primitives who were so cnamoured by
the idea of western man imitating the “no-
ble" savages and renouncingthe materialism
of our age and, in fact, ther whole industrial
revolution—all these grouprenet‘ited by ex-
aggerating and twisting and distorting the
facts on environmental problems and advan-
cing ridiculous and hysterical stop-gap
solutions to such problems.

Thus laws were passed which choked up
the automobile engines with emission con-
trol devices which were given insufﬁcient
time to be perfected. Result: a 15%dccrease
in gas mileage. TheAIaskan pipeline was
delayed. This showed quite well that the
enviro-maniacs were more concerned with
the migrating habits of Caribou then the
l'recting of people in heatless buildings back
home. Off-shore drilling for oil has been
delayed. the building ofdeep-water ports for
tankers has been postponed. the building of
refineries has been stalled. the construction
of nuclear power plants has been slowed. the
mining of coal above ground and below has
been aggravated and the burning of coal has
been (discouraged all because of sir-called
environmentalists. Anu incy navethe gall to
say they have had nothing to do with the
energy crisis. Nonsense!

Technology is being used to make the
Alaskan pipeline sale. just as it is being used
to lessen the chances for oil spills from oll-
shore drills and oil tankers and also to stop
the spread ol oil it an accident should occur.
Rtttrottttl solutions to pollttliori problems do
exist and “c can develop ortt energy
resources without ruining (ttll'ttlt rind ttatcr'

The recent call for 50 mph speed limits
highlights the stupidity ofrcccnttlovernmcnt'
laws and regulations. Automobiles are US-
ing up much more gas than to years ago.
This is no good anymore so we are told to
slow down. Why are cars so gas hungry
today‘.’ First. emission controls make the
engine mach less efficient. The recent
devices were forced on the automobile by the
Clean Air Act of I970 which calls for un-
realistically strict exhaust standards at a con-
siderable cost to econotny. safety. and
driveability. Secondly. the automobile is
much heavier than to years ago.also causing
increased gas consumption. Why is it so
heavy? Along with the increasing use ofop-
tional equipment, the federal safety laws
which mandate heavier bumpers and other
structural changes increase the weight of
your car. Poorer gas mileage, in others
words. is mainly caused by government
edict.
