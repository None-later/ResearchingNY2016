A rather large crowd
witnesses the Albany wrestling
team‘s seventh victory as they
beat Oneonta State 29 to ll.to

run their record to 7 —- l.
Wednesday.

Albany. who at one point
trailed 9 —— 3 after three

matches, battled back with un-
defeated Tom Horn winning a
nine to five decision to tie the
imatch.Horn seemed to wrestle
the last thirty seconds with one
good eye after taking a shot in
the other.

Doug Bauer then put Albany
in front to stay as he picked up
Albany‘s only pin of the match
in 4:22. Forthe co-captain. it
was a great win, coming off his
two defeats Saturday and a sore
ankle that was again taped.

We decided not to wait that
long and instead examined the

squad right at mid-season.
The Danes, who lost twice
this weekend to Geneseo State
and University of Buffalo, are
now 7-6. and 1-2 in SUNYAC'
play. Spoiled as we‘ve been by
Coach Doc Saucrs outstanding

fans are worried about the
future of this year‘s team. and
ultimately of next year‘s team.
