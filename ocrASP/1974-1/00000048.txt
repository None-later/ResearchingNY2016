“Any movie biography of a composer must
look for some indirect way of convincing
us that we are party to the personal tile of
an artistic giant. British director Keri
Russell attempts in his film about Peter
Itich Tchaikovsky to bridge the chasm
between tile and art by reaching for a
cinematic style that captures the romantic
spirit of the composer‘s music. And . ..
the film la a triumph. Russell serves up
whole movements and complete arias as
his camera moves gracefully over the
events of the composer's lilo. Russell has
a marvellous aye: an Idyl in a pristine birch
forest. with Tchaikovsky and his sister
clad in white. la beautiful to look at. Russell
also uses music effectively. . . to lnluse

KEN RUSSE
THE MUSIC LOVERS

 

Glenda Jackson

The outpouring of color. oi detail. of
lantasy is matched by the performances at
the players. Richard Chamberlain, who
has been acclaimed In every medium from
the television series to the Shakespearian
stage. as the composer. and Academy
award-winning Glenda Jackson as his
Intense. lruatiat'id wile, display breath-
taking omotionat range.
Russell is not intimidated by Tchaikovsky’s
excesses. This time he has abandoned
himself to his aublact. and his dynamic
baroque style of shooting and editing
draws us boldly into scene after scans. At
momenta Russell achieves a kind of
cinematic aynestheela In which all senses
—vlaual. aural. oven tactile—seem to blur.
This film breaks down the conventional
distance between spectator and material:
it forces us to extremes. To understand
THE MUSIC LOVERS one must be willing
to experiment. to surrender to its
