Since September. the SUNYA

four people in each event. with the
best three scores counting. The
scores are based on l0.0asa perfect

Mary seems to belong on the beam,
her eyebrows are arched just
enough to give a ﬂair to her face, a
sense of dramatics. Her gestures
seem graceful. natutal although a
little hammy and. mostI important

Allyson. who also performs on
the beam, commented “You are
supposed to seem a little stuck up...
thumovcmcntsarc... supposed to be
exact.“

Mary Irad a Miami idea, “It's
all faked. after a while you learn
how you are supposed to move
your hands."

Mary is ready to dismount. Her
body is poised. her eyes oblivious

For all the pain. Gymnastics has
its value to the Gymnasts. Pattyl
Murphy. a sister of Chi Sig. said
this about its worth. “To see what

Allyson had another New “It‘s
