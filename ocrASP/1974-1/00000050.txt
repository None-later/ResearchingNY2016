day by the White House:
SPENDING - The administra-
tion proposes to spend $304.4
billion. the ﬁrst SJOO-billion-plus
federal budget in history. It is an
increase of $29.8 billion over fiscal
I974. which ends June 30.
REVENUES / The government
estimates it will take in $295 billion
in taxes and other revenues. in-
cluding about $2 billion from a
'windfall proﬁts tax on the oil in-
dustry. The deﬁcit will be $9.4
billion.

BUDGET PHILOSOPHY
Nixon said the budget provides
moderate economic stimulus and
promised to increase spending to
prevent a recession. The incrertscd
spending is as largely in undom
trollables‘. such as Social Security
and welfare.

DEFENSE - Defense spending
will rise $6.3 billion to a total of
$85.8 billion. largest in history.
()ther' delense-rclatcd expen-
ditures. including ltitids for the
Atomic l:nergy Commission. bring
delense outlays to $87.7 billion.

TRANSPORTATION - A'ma—
jor new thrust in the budget is what
is in effect a revenue sharing
program for transportation that
would allow cities to step up spen-
ding for mass transit. Funds from

in new funds would be used for the
totril $2.3 billion program.

INCOME SECURITY - Forthc
first time. federal expenditures to
support the income of needy
Americans, through Social Securi-
ty. public assistance and other
programs. tops $100 billion. It is
an increase ol‘SlS billion over the
previous fiscalyca r. A large pa rt of
the boost is in Social Security
benelit increases.

TAXI-IS - Except for the windfall
profits tax. the budget proposes no
new levies.

HEALTH - Spending for health
programs totals $26 billion. up $3
billion. most of that in Medicare
spending. The administration
