to stay out as long as it takes."

St. Louis. Mo. He and thousands
of independent truckers in at least
30 states were staying put. their rigs

determined they won't move
without strong governmentaction.

“We‘re between a rock and a
hard place." Sanders said. “If we
can‘t get these fuel prices rolled
back and some money in our
pockets. we‘ll let the ﬁnance com-
pany take over our trucks."

Inside many truck stops. drivers
slept. played cards and telephoned
home to say tlicy‘d be there some
time. Outside. the night sounds of

gear~grinding rigs humming down
the roads with their cargoes were
virtually non—existent in some
areas.
