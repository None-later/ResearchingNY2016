Galactic electric piano. high
energy mu_sic.and communication.
These are some of the more ap-
propriate words to use when dis-
cussing the Chick Corea and
Return to Forever concert held in
‘the Campus Center ballroom last
Thursday.

The rootn was lillcd front to
hack attd side to side with an
audience that couldn‘t help but en-
joy the mtisical experience of Cor-
ea and his group. Return to
Forever.. If anyone yvent in con-
fused about ja/J. tltey left having
seen and heard a prime example of
wltat the music is all about.

The philosophy of the hand. as
t.‘\’i(.iL'tlL‘C(.l by its magnetic perfor-
ntance. centers around corri-
ntuuication. From an established
Irumework of rhythms and an oc-
casional melody. the songs bccaiiye
dialogs for two instruments and
conyet'sations between all four.

McLaughlin inﬂuence is un-
doubtedly present. but it is in a new
context established by Corea and
Clarke. and‘espeeially by the per-
sonality of Conners expressed
through the emotional channel of
his guitar. He seems new to the
conversation way of playing. but
handles it quite well.

Lenny White. the drummer, had
little time for “conversation”; he
took advantage of his occasional
opportunities. More often. Wltite
was the powerhouse of the group.
who managed the itttcrtial floods
and torrents of his energy with
itma/ingdiscipline-crciitingatiex-
citing tension which heightened the
impact of each song.

the group played its most recent
album. Hymn ol' the Scrum/t
Ga/uxti. iii its entirety. Th ' album.
howeyer. is only an approximation
of what took place on the live stage.
li ch sting was given extended
treatment. allowing for dramatic
and building intensity which is only
hinted at on the studio albtim.
Althoitgh the album stands on its
ow it. anyone who has seen Corea in
concert will realize the album is
more like it souvenir. carrying cues
that remind the listener oftlte con-
ccrt's myrt/iu/i/i' extetided styles

 

and accompanying excitement.
Corea established his rapport
with the audience altirost irri-
titediately by giying "a little orien-
tattott" session that ultitiiately trac-
ed the audiettce's location to the
seyenth galaxy, Alter presenting
his group. he introduced the lirst
song. appropriately titled “llyinn
ol the Seyciitlt Galaxy." which

forecasted the dynamic space-jazz
to follow.

Opening the_ next number,
“After the Cosmic Rain." Stanley
Clarke set up a sustained hell or
glass-like tone on bass. to bejoined
shortly by Corea. who was feeling
out notes on his piano. The song. a
good example of interaction
between the members. intensified
to air unbelievable degree.
propelled by the group‘s unrelen-
ting drive. Conners became a key
figure. his guitar reaching new
heights of frenetic energy. The
applause duritig the song and the
oyatioti afterwards were inevitable
expressions of appreciation for the
best performance of the evening.

llte group ntastcrlully handled
the problem of following a
knockout song by changing the
locus momentarily attd giving l.cn-
ti_v White solo time. White opened
the song “'lhemc lor the Mother
Spaceship" with a remarkable
drum solo, After a lot of hard.
sweat-producing work with very
positiye results. White began a soft.
tight drum roll which sounded like
a steady si/Ile. Building up a bait
under a gradual crescendo. White

led the group itito some
triumphant music.
On occasion. problems with

White‘s drum microphones and
cymbal screws arose. but these
were remedied by a fellow whose

Clarke (“for the only time all even-

notic and ethereal qitality of Cor-

Record Review

What is Life But a Spectrum?

\by Rick Pulley

“What is life but a spectrum and
what is music but life itself;" so says
drummer-percussionist Billy
Cobham. on the liner notes for his
first solo album. “Spectrum.” This
philosophy is reflected in the
album as we are presented with an
ania/ing array of ideas. styles. and
air equally large display of rayv
musical talent. in the numerous
outstanding artists that (‘obham
