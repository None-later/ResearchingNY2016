Term Papers» Sold» Here. Stavisky- Says

Illegal term papercompanies are
operating “in the shadow of the
state capital," in direct violation of
the law. Assemblyman Leonard P.
Stavisky charged today"

.ReﬁearCh i Assistance. Inc., a
California based operation. is
offering term papers for sale on the
SUNYA campus.

Assemblyman Stavisky said he
would add this latest violation to
the mounting evidence. some of
which he has already accumulated
at downstate colleges and univer-
sities. Stuvisky has already found
illegal advertisements in a dozen
different college newspapers in the
New York metropolitan area..

On the Albany State Campus.
the advertising took the form of

 

pamphlets posted in the student
union.

Stavisky said he was “shocked to
see the open solicitation by term
paper companies so close to the
capital."

In response to this newest viola—
tion of the law. Stavisky said he
was transmitting the evidence to
State Attorney General Louis
Lefkowitl. and will be asking
Chancellor Ernest Boyer and
SUNY at Albany President Louis
Benczet. to investigate and enforce
the state law.

“Over a year and a halfat'tcr the
law first went into effect. college
editors continue to devalue their
degrees by accepting the thinly-
veilcd term paper ads," Stavisky
said.

Would Reform Lobbying

State Senator Roy M. Goodman
(RvL, Manhattan) and
Assemblyman H. Clark Bell (R-
Ulstcr) today introduced legisla-
tion to extensively reform re-
quirements and procedures gover-
ning lobbying activity in the State
Legislature.

The Goodman~Bell proposal
would rcquirethatall lobbyistsand
their employers register annually
with the Office of the Secretary of
State and would require a complete
financial statement from lobbyists
within 60 days of the adjournment
of the legislative session.

I'hc Goodman-Bell legislation
provides for citi/en suits against
violators. under which any citilcn
who initiates successful action
against it lobbyist who fails to com-
ply with Statc lawwould hecligible
for hall of tltc $ltlt) pcrdtiy penalty
recovered by lhc State.

In I971. ortly 322 lobbyists
registered “llll the Secretary of

need an effective law to ensure an
open decision making process.

"l‘hc current law which was
enacted almost seventy years ago is
so loosely drawn and unclear that
enforcement is minimal. 'l‘oo freq
ucntly. lobbyists use loopliolcsand
cut corners to evade full disclosure
of their purposes and procedures."

A lobbyist. in the technical
sense. is a person rctairtcd or
employed to proniolc or oppose
the passage of bills or resolutions
by the Legislature

No lobbyist could engage in lob-

The section of the state educa—

Stavisky. stating that no person

Marcilio responded to thc
btiirtigc of critical questions in a
style that was aircl'iil and sclf—
assured. While well aware ot the
critical ttltitudc ol ltis American
audience. he was unrullled by it.

and a woman front thc audience
began translating his remarks. but
at times hcr Iinglish was brokcrt
and sortie phrases wcrc incom—
piclicnsiblc. l‘owardtliccndoftlic

ly in tlic I‘.llglisll questions. but his
answers continued to he irt his
nativc l'or'lugucsc. Allqnotcd por-
tions below are pltritscs uscd bytltc
intcrprctcr spcakiitg lot Marcilio.

Marcilio maintained at several
points that the international press
was out of touch with reality and
was exaggerating rcportsinorder
to discredit Brazilian government.

ththci Ititi/il has iinper'ialistic
dcsiics » Ihc I’i‘csidcnt claims that
:t lira/than slogan is "Morc than
cici. good neighbor". and his
country's interest was iii dcvclop-

 

ing itself and maintaining peace
with its neighbors.

What was the role of the
Brazilian legislature under the
Military - Contrary to reports that
the Brazilian legislature is a rubber
stamp to the military. Marcilio
claimed in his speech that the
military “assists” the congressmen.
He later dismissed this question as
a problem for pilitical scientists -
and said Brazilians were attemp-
ting to deline the role of the
legislature iii modern society.
iHethcri claimed that the fticts
would come out - he sitid the
August convention in llrtililiii will
rcvcal the “r ‘tII trtitli“to tltc world.

Asked whether he felt the last
presidential election was fair. Itiid
popular participation. and includ-
ed opcn discussion of the can
didatcs before the elections Mar-
cilio said - there was indeed debate
in ittcrllousc.tticScnzItc. and iii the
press on the candidates. IIc claim-
cd that the pcoplc were content

\olc at the convention ltad in-
dicatcd tltc unanimity of support
behind tltc candidatc. he said.

What is the trtitli hcbind reports
ol political pi'isoncrs‘ torture‘.’
Marcilio claimed that some of the
reports in the press oit lirii/ilian
political torture were prepared
propaganda aimed at discrediting
the government. The sixty
terrorists released by Brazil in ex-
change tor thc American am-
bassador showed no signs of tor-
ttirc when they reached Mexico. he
pointed out. an example contrary
to the torture rcports.

Murctho said. as a politictan and
ii professor tic rtiiist allow that
cases of torture did occur. He
quickly added that his government
has tiikcit olticial action against
those involved iii political tortures.
He did not explain just what ol-
Iiciiil action was taken. I‘tt)WC\/L'r.

Whether Brit/il's economic
successes are being cvcnly dis-
tributed tlii'ouglidiit the country -
Marcilio did riot arisch this tpics~

 

tion directly, instead noting that in
even the US. there is inequality of
living standards from region to
region. while he explained that the
industrial regions would necessari-
ly be more developed. He said his
government had plans to develop
and integrate all the country‘s
regions - but what these plans were
he did not say.

Whether he felt the Catholic
church in BritIlI wasa Communist
agent - t-LI t’residcrttc said that only
it small number of the priests were
tising the cover of the church to
“Work against the country."
