Op Ld: 9 diamonds

Following memorized
rules can be very helpful at
the beidgc table. but should
not be adhered to blindly.

by Jack Uppal

Gambi.‘s in the openingr
usually involve sacrificmg
material for quick develop-
ment and attacking
possibilities. In the recent
Schenectady Winter liilllllgl,’
Tournament. Steven
Ladenheim. who finished
third in the tournament With
4' 2-"2, won two of his games
using such gumbits.

 

 

 

In the following hand.
taken from a local duplicate
game. the 9 afdiamonds was
led against South's 3 NT con-
tract. 'l‘he deuce was played
from dummy. East now
follows the "rule" that third
hand always plays high. and
puts down his Queen. South
takes the Queen with the
King and next plays the Ace
otheurts. He then leads adia-
mond to the Jack and finishes
With three rounds of hearts.

play his Queen. South wins
the diamond lead with the
Ten. Cashes his Ace of hearts.
He now tries to getto dummy
by finessing the Jack of
diamonds but this loses to
East's Queen. Now. on any
return by East. South can
play to the Ace of'diamonds.
play the top two hearts and
give up a heart. but cannot
return to dummy to cash his
heart winners. The result:
3N’l' defeated.

How does West know not to
play his Queen? Well. he
doesn't. but he can see that
his partner's lead denies
possesston of any higher
honor curds. 'l'hcrci‘ore. it
(*uultln'l possibly be correct
