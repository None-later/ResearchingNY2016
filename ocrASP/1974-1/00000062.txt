iTAP-ing Our Resources

The Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) likely to pass the state legislature this session would
have very serious ramiﬁcations for SUNY students.

TAP would abolish the present regents scholarship program and replace it with a system of
direct grants to students based entirely on financial need. it is intended to even the competition
between the massive public universities and the ﬁnancially ailing private institutions. so it
would award private school students up to $l700 towards their tuition bills. btit would give
SUNY students a maximum of only $600. This would attract students to the private schools.
which presently report over 30.000 vacant seats.

The $600 allocation to SUNY students would nearly cover the lower division tuitioncost.
but forjuniors and seniors. it would mean a shortfall of$200 since upperdivision tuition now
stands at $800.

in other words. thousands of SUNY students now getting their whole tuition paid would
have to start paying some of it themselves. Students going to private schools would beneﬁt
greatly. htit at the expense of us SUNY students. We say that this is unfair.

There are other serious drawbacks to the TAP proposal:

.The draft icgiskniou submitted by Assemblyman l’etcr Costigan (R-l’ortJefferson)
contains no provision prohibiting private schools from going right ahead and continuing lto
raise tuition after TAP is enacted.

-TAP does not rcquirc a contribution by private schools toward additional scholarships.

-'l'Al’ sets a precedent lor the “voucher " system ofaid to secondary and elementary school
education.

-mosl importantly, 'l'Al’ overlooks the state's paramount obligation to fund public higher
education. The amount ol'aid in the proposed bill l’orSlJNY and CUNY students is negligible
in relation to the total package.

SUNY budget. are very tight. Faculty student ratios continue to rise.
should not forget its obligation to the ptiblie schools created ten- years ago.

The lcgislatirrc

 

We urge the Select Committee on Higher Education. which is still studying TAP. to take
into careful accotint the many objections to the plan. TAP is backed by the powerful
Republican leadership. but perhaps the testimony of public school officials to be heard by the
committee later this month will change some minds. Wit-certainly hope so.

Which Hunt

Wednesday night's live-hour Council Meeting more resembled a witch hunt than it
legislative session. it was sad to watch a group of purportedly mature. intelligent people
scream for Eric Lonschcin‘s blood and hassle for hours over the best way to execute the matter.
Somehow. the crux of the issue was lost amidst the cries for blood.

Lonschein was wrong. admittedly rind without a doubt. So were the others involved who
abused their privileges, thereby tainting the Student Government. What they did not onlyhurt
themselves. ultimately. but also hurt the Student Association. Central Council.and the strident
body as a whole. it left a bad taste in cveryonc's mouth. a bad taste that will taken while to sub-
side.

lt was tight that some sort ofaction should be taken against the guilty. but the kind ofaction
Council took Wednesday night was a disgrace and a sham. For one. alter some five hours of
debate. Council rejected the recommendations of its own committee set up to investigate the
ﬁasco. thus doing absolutely nothing by waon punishment. But even more importantly.and
even more of ii disgrace to the students who clcctcd them. Council virtually ignored the
problem ol what to do about the seventy students still waiting to know if they could go to
Honda. in tact. when one of those present brought up the matter. she was ruled out ofordcr
and indeed. the Council laughed. And it wasn't even a snicker. It was a belly laugh.

Now. if ('ouncil thinks the rights of the students of this University isa laughing matter. they
deserve as much censure as Eric Lonscheiri. For while they condemned Ericrind the others for
their sellishncss and hick of concern for others. they were just as guilty of a similar crime.

(Apologies to those on Council whooffcred their servrccsto aid in straighteningout this mess )

Gasoline Rationing:

Washington The recent publication of

Diabolic Rationale

To the Editor:

Quotes are often useful tools for convey-
ing an idea or belief to others in words that
we ourselves may lack the finesse to coin in
such precise a manner. Last Friday. the
twenty 77 fifth of January, a letter was
written to the ASP entitled. The Devil Made
Me Do II. which by the use of quotes and
personal data. gave Mr. Macaluso‘s impres-
sion of the ideal state where individualism
would be abolished and conformity become
the rule. I tend to disagree.

This article was true enough in many
statements and generalities concerning the
development of onc‘s image of himself in
relation to others through contact with
other people. Yes. in a sense. society and
people in general tell us what we arcand urge
us in many ways to replace our idiosyn-
cracics with a conformity which lacilitatcs
their labeling of each ol us as either accep-
table. or as a “wicrdo” or "lrcrik." Society
sets the bounds of acceptable conduct and
transgressors pay thc price ol noriconlornir»
ly.

'l'hc generality was mct'cxtctidcd tliortgli
when it was flatly stated that. “Man is not an
individual but ultimately ri product ol
society and culture.“ History shown us that
this is much too simple a slatcmcnt. ll man
was merely a prodticl of society and culture.

nasty word about which nothing would be
done. -

Yes. non — conformity does have its place:

in society and it is a vital necessity for any
society to reach its full potential. The letter
claimed that individualin must be destroyed
and replaced with Brotherhood in Christ for
freedom to occur. Rather. through educa-
tion. individuality should be enhanced. but
for the purpose of bettering the society in
which individuals live and work. The
replacement of ignorance with knowledge
and the improvement of living standards for
the ccotiotnically deprived can only become
a reality if we take a deep and critical look
into ourselves as individualsand collectively
as a society. for the two are irrevocably in-
terlwincd. Then we must be honest with
what we find there. The rising incidence of
divorce. crime. interpersonal distrust and
situational morality certainly indicate that
something is wrong. It is up to us as in—
diiidtials. coirccrncd for the society which
surrounds us. to find out what is wrong and
“by. Only then will a Brotherhood in Christ
tlc\clop widely. and unbiased lovc become a
i‘crrlrty.

Verbal Backlash  :

To the Editor:

Recently in Delancey Hall on Colonial
Quad. a rash of Anti-Semitism has arisen.
After the Christmas vacation an insignia of
an lsraeli flag was placed on the door
between suites 303 and 302. The dorm direc—
tor thougbt there was nothing wrong with
doing so. Out of nowhere a swastika
appeared on the ﬂag. It was at ﬁrst ignored
and erased. Within the next few days. two
more swastikas appeared on the door. these
however were scratched deep into the in-
signia. It's obvious that someone living here
is either an Anti-Semite. or thinks that he is
being funny. Since we do not know which is
true. we would like to inform them that we
do not find thisamusing. Furthermore. there
have also been some remarks made that are
o\crwheliningly unfavorable to the Jewish
pcoplc.

lliough we haven‘t sum the swastikas ‘u
drawn. there have bcerr \erbal clashes with
certain people. and we leel that thus ' are the
ones who are dcliicing this lsraeli flag. We
don‘t want this conllict to continue and
