DEA Must Romania *

(CI’S) The U. S. Court of
Appeals in Washington DC hand-
ed down it rulingJanriary ISorder-
ing the Drug Administration
Agency (DEA! to institute “rule—
making procedures“ to determine
rl marijuana should he reclassified
within the dangerous drtrg
schedules. or removed from the
dangerous substance list
altogether.

('ur'r'cntly. marijuana is listed on
Sclrcdtrlc | ol the dangerous sub-
stances list. thereby cltis ging it
with heroin. llre National
Organization lor the Reform of
Marijuana Laws (NORML) filed
the suit which resulted in the court
order to the l)l-'A to look irtto

NEW. The Narcotics Bureau
replied that it v’as unable to recon-
.v'idcr the status of marijuana
because of “treaty obligations."
and NORML filed suit in federal
court.

When the NORML suit was
heard. government lawyers btrilt
their case on the assertion that an
international agreement ratiﬁed by
the US. Senate nine years ago (the
"Single Convention Treaty of
Not“) prohibited the US. from
rcclrrssilying marijuana. The
Appeals Court ruled that the treaty
does not prohibit a reclassiﬁcation.
and ordered the DEA to accept
Vt)RMI.'.s petition and investigate
the status ol the weed.

According to NORMI. attorney
l'etcr’ Meyer‘s. there is no indica-
rrorr ol when the DEA will hold
hearings. but he added "We hope
it's as soon as possible." It mari-
rrriirra is totally removed lrom the
dangerous drug schedules. it vvotrld

V’Measure   

Flip-top cans and non-
returnablc containers. which have
been littering New York‘s
landscape at a tremendous cost to
taxpayers and the environment.
will become a thing ol'thc past un-
der legislation ﬁled by State
Senator Bernard C. Smith of
Northport.

The Smith bill. which will be
effective this fall. would require it
deposit of three to live cents on
nearly all beverage bottles. cans or
plastic containers. It will reqtrlrc
that till such containers manufac-
tured. distributed or sold in the
state be labeled with the correct rc-
l'und amount.

Any person will he allowed to
return it redeemable container to a
retailer or a privately operated
redemption center and collect it re-
ltrrrd. l’lic rcltind will be payed
whether or not the container cart be
revised.

Under the Smith plan. flip-top
cans will be banned in the state
eighteen months after enactment ol
the lavv. Also banned is ill be plastic

\ectirdrng to Senator Smith. the
proposal vvrll save taxpayer‘s
thousands of dollars annually in
espensrvc cleanup costs and will
drrrirrrrslr flt'tlflfl and satiety dangers
caused by discarded containers.

Senator Smith said. "I rceogrri/c
that such a plan vvillplrrcerr burden

rarrrers tiia distrrhutur or rriarrirlzte-

Senator Smith added: “a plan ril

the legislation will affect all in-
dividual. sealed glass. metal or
plastic bottled. CtlllS.jttrS or cartons
which contain any bcer. malt
beverage. carbonated or non—
carbonated soft drink. mineral
water. tea or soda water“. It will not
affect containers used for other
purposes or containers that
presently carry a deposit require-
ment of more than live cents.

The refund required on each
container willb'u minimum ofﬁve

New York Department of En-

According to Senator Sriiitli.

; beverage. This includes any stan-
dardized container. if the dealer

A dealer may not refuse to apy the
refund if he sells that kind. size. or

A person also may return a con-
tainer to a neighborhood or
regional redemption center. ifsuch
a center is established. The
redemption center can be operated
by any individual or organization
that wishes to engage in the collec-
ting and sorting of containers. The

loperator of a redemption center
will have the right to determine
what types and brands of con-
tainch he will handle. However.
the operator of a redemption
