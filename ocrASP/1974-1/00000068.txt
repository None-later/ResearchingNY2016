Farr Trade Law
New York state‘s so —-called fair
trade law is an anachronistic anti
— consumer device designed to
maintain arbitrary product prices
and is particularly offensive in the
light of the inﬂation spiral. At-
torneyGeneralLouis J. Lefkowitz
said Monday in recommending
legislative action toamend the law.

“More than three decades have
passed since the enactment of the
statute during the depression ofthc
l930‘s when conditions at that time
required unusual remedies follow-
ing the end of the National

At that time.henoted. the fair —

state's anti — trust law. was passed
but now should be abandoned as
“as anachronistic anti —— consumer
device for price maintenance."

Attorney General Letkowitr. said
the bill be has recommended to the
Legislature would; provide that
only the individuals who sign fair

7 trade contracts would be subject
to court action to maintain the
price ﬁxed in such contracts.

“Consumer. civic and labor an-
ion organizations advocate the
elimination of this monopolistic
system which statistics show has
cost New York State consumers
millions of ofdollars over the years
it ltas been the law." he said. He
said such an artiﬁcial price struc-
ture has a negative effect in that I
induces consumers to purchase
commodities in non fair trade
states and the District of Colum-
hia. either in person or by mail.

“The amendment would limit

persons who sign the contracts to
maintain the ﬁxed price and
remove the indefensible anomaly
which binds. to a privately fixed
price. sellers who are non
signers." Attorney General
l.cl'kowitz said.

“ l'ltc least the Legislature can do
is to pass a bill which I have also
recommended to end the lair

'Solzheiiiisyii"

MOSCOW (AP) Alexander
Solzhenitsyn. the target of bitter
ofﬁcial attacks for publication of
his book on Stalinist labor camps,l
rejected on Monday a summons to
the Soviet prosecutor's office. He
said he would not appear for in-
terrogation.

The prosecutor‘s ofﬁce had
delivered a second summons to the
apartmenoftheauthor's wife. and
Solzhenitsyn said he refused to
acknowledge legality of the sum-
mons.

Followinga furious campaign of
official press denunciations of
Solzhenitsyn and his book. “Gulag
Archipelago.“ the prosecutor's ac-
tion could be the start of an

. attempt to silence the author by

arrest and
against him.

initiating charges

A summons was delivered on
Friday. but Solzhenitsyn‘s wife
refused to accept it. A new docu-
ment was taken to her apartment
Monday and Solzhenitsyn then
issued a deﬁant statement to the
prosecutor.

“In a situation ofgeneral illegali-
ty which for many years has existed
in our country - and the personal
eight-yeareampaignol'slanderand
harassment of me - I refuse to
acknowledge the legality of your
summons and will not come for an
interrogation to any state organ."
the statement said.

The summons. requesting his
appearance at l0a.m.Tuesday.did
not say why the procurator

wanted to see Solzhenitsyn.

“Before asking legality from
citizens learn how to observe it
yourself. Free the innocent from
confinement.

“ Punish tltose guilty of mass ex-
ecutions and false informers.
Punish the administrators and the
special organs which have per—
formed genocide exile of peoples.
Remove from local and regional
satraps today their unlimited
power over citizens. the ordering
about of courts and psychiatrists."

Solzhenitsyn apparently views
the shifting of certain nationalities
from one place to another in the
Soviet Union as a form of
genocide.

l'hc ofﬁce of procurator general
in the Soviet Union bears some
similarities to the attorney
gcneral‘s office in the United States
and has broad powers to in-
vestigate and prosecute crimes.

The summons was signed by A.
Balashnv of the investigative divi-
sion.

When asked about the sum-
motts. Bala hung up the telephone
without answering.

“Some Stations Refusr

to Comply with Rationing

(AP) Motorists cxpcctinga

appointed Monday as many ser-
vice station owners refuscd to com-

alternate-day rationing plan.

While ntost autos in the long

Press spot check indicated.

"I'm going out that door right

manager of a Kayo station in

line and waiting. ljust don't have
the heart to tell them to go.“

Meanwhile. Governor Malcolm
Wilson continued to press for
emergency powers to make the
plan mandatory and proclaim a
one-year state ol'cmergency. Dur-
ing the year. Wilson would assume
itcw powers over the use and dis-
tribution of electricity. gas. coal

A spokesman lor the governor

.UTA Helping Tenants

by Robert Decherd

Recently. a tenant on Western
Avenue. received a notice from her
landlord. The notice read: “As of
April I. I973. the rent for this
apartment will be raised from $123
per rttottth to $280 per month."

this sort ofoccurrcnce is not un-
common in Albany. now that
"vacancy decontrol" has been in
effect fortlirceyears. Tltcrc still of-
ficially exists rettt control in
Albany. brit three years ago the
sititedcgislaturc passed the “vacan-
ey decontrol" measure. which
means that when a rent controlled
apartment becomes vacant. the
apartment is no longer under rent
control and the landlord can raise
the rent to whatever 'lcvel he
pleases. So rent control is now
practically nonwxistent. except in
cases where tertants ltavc cluttg
tenacioust to their rcrtt controlled
apartments. Every day now.
tenants are exposed to new rent in-
creases.

United Icttartts of Albany
(UlA) is trying to do something
about the probletn. Created about
four years ago. UTA has been
working to protect tenants rights
and interests ever since. And they
are actively lobbying for laws that
will change what they consider it
landlord-oriented legislative
system.

'I‘hcit' chief target is vacancy
dccontrol. btit they have also been
pushirtg several other tenant-
rcltitcd bills. including provisions
that would ,prohibit rcprisals by
lattdlords against tenants who
report ltcaltlt and code violations
or joirt tenant organizations like
U I’A. as well as another bill which
\vould allow a tenant to tnake
repairs arid deduct the cost from
tltc rcrtt ii the landlord refuses to
make the repairs. himself.

legislation is not the total answer.

according to [HA activist (‘at'ol

 

Nelson. is owned by “slumlords”
who live elsewhere in the Capital

'District. and collect exorbitant

rents from afar and refuse to make
adequate repairs. UTA is working
with the tenants to make sure the
repairs are performed. and they
also provide legal assistance to
tenants who use the court process
to get repairs and protect their
rigltts.

Accordingdo Nelson. there are
two Albany landlords who have
been particularly troublesome.
Frank Romeo. she  has
bought up a large number of
buildings and has charged exorbi-
tant rents without making any
repairs. The City takes no action
against him because Romeo
tltrcatcrts ltc will evict all of his
tenants.

.loc Gerrity. the other “big
slumlrird" has holdings primarily
in the Hamilton Street area under
the shadow of the South Mall. Ac-
cording to Nelson. he buys houses.
allows them to deteriorate while
still collecting rents. and then
evicts the tenants. The houses are
boarded up. vandalized. and even-
tually thcyare demolished. Gerrity
is purportedly trying to accumulate
cnouglt land to build parking lots
and luxury apartment complexes.
According to activist. Mike
Howard. wltole neighborhoods are
destroyed by this.

Nelson says that UTA is in a
position to help students with their
housing hassles. too, She says the
organization would be qurtc will-
Ing to help students get repairs
