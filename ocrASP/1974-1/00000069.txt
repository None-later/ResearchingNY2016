lA Candidates’ Bazaar

Candidates and political hopefuls gathered at the Ramada lnn for a “getting to know you"
gala Friday night. The general atmosphere seemed hopeful. although. ofcourse. traditionally
tedious. The candidates all held basically the same belief: the Democrats could and would win
next November because the present Republican majority has one main thing going against it—
their abominable record. All thosewhomade it tothe event believed they could handlethcjob.

To be sure. those who hadn't arrived failed to do so not because they doubted their chances
of success, but due merely to the inclement weather that grounded air transport in New York
City and Washington.

All good intentions aside. so many people are running for the some positions in the primaries
that it seems quite unlikely that the party can unify itself by next September.

. Howard Samuels wants the gcvernorship. His campaign is already moving into middle gear.
So does Ogden Reid. who already has begun the lecture circuit searching for votes. Rumor has
it that United States Congressman Sam Stratton (D-Schcn.) may also be looking seriously at
the nomination. Furthermore, all three have a great deal of strenght iii the party. Stratton has
the aura ofa magnetic vote-getter:bolh upstate Democrats and moderate Republicans have
conststcntly supported him in the past. but he is very weak downstate. with little recognition
among the New York-Long Island constituency. Sainuels. on the otherhiind. probably has the
downstate region ﬁrmly in his camp. due mainly to his successes as the O'chhief, A SamueIS-
Strtitton ticket would probably be the single most effective ticket. though such a union is quite
unlikely.

Personalities were played down by the candidates. each being content to chastise the Nixon-
Rockclellcr years and propose the obligatory vagtic campaign pledges. All in all. it was a
typical political dinner. highlighted by it single bright personality: l’aul O'Dwycr.

' Mr. O‘Dwycr was at once the most believable man at the entire forum.and the reason isob—
vious: he was not running for office. Speaking of his new office as President ofthe New York
City Council. O’Dwyer described New York's new mayor. Abc Beanie. as often “
llis disarming candor and l
the stuffy occasion.

l'hc Democrats could in fact sweep the mid-term elections this year. by cashing in on the bad
Republican record and the Nixon-Watergate fiasco. But ‘ Allard Lowenstcin. the uri-
announced non-ctindidittc for the Senate said. the Democrats have an uncanny ntick lor trun~
mg what appears to be a walk—away victory into an electoral disaster.

A Token Change

The era ofthc chits has ended. With its sad passage no doubt will go the hearts and hear-
taches ol the preponderance ofresidcnt students who came to view the little nasties with a coni-
bination of outright contempt. ltorror. and resigned pragmatism. it is true. these modern
marvels of designed annoyance have seen their last Albany State laundry load. No longer will
they shatter arrogantly in the washing machines.

The Faculty Student Assoctation. after much consternation and the innumerable rumblings
of student ulcers. decided that. security notwithstanding. thc laundry tokens must go. They
were iii experimental use for a few months. and in that brief time. more broken washing
machines. more broken ptiticnccs. and more broken toes and irsts have been wasted on those
plastic monstrositics than might ever be recorded accurately for the histtirittnsol'tlie llllUrC.

Somewhere during the Middle Ages ol'the “Chit Era." the slots in which they were deposited
developed a voracious appetite known as “chit-munching.“ ’l his soon heralded the discovery
that chit-related accidents caused some machines to operate for tree. much to the disappoint-
ment of l‘SA. Thus it became it matter ofcvcryone concerned. it joint effort iioi often seen at
this institution. to divest ourselves of this evil plague.

 

With the advent ol the token-operated washing machines. the price ol'doinga laundry load
took it 20% increase. tint exactly iii keeping with the Nixon Administration‘s 5.5% increase
guidelines. but nonetheless. accepted. albeit hesitantly by the mass ol the resident population.
Students louitd it possible to write off the increase as ilic price ol producing the tokens
themselves. though the little devils could not possibly be Worth the nickel they were lorkingout
lot them.

[hits the announcement that the price ol the laundry would not return to 25 cents brings
with ll a lccling tliai somehow. thc students have been had. Students litiyc paid enough already
Ill terms of lost hours that could be far better spent in the prtisuit ol more productive labors.
and in the actital cost of the wash itself. It would bcn poor (lCClSIttll on the part ol l-SA. nlici
having acted. albeit unintentionally. iii the student‘s interest. to now imposcthe higher cost on
the poor quality laundry service oit ilic rcsourcclcss resident sltttlcnl.
