Gerber Assesses SA Role in Student Life

by Kurt Emmerich

President of Student Associa-
tion Steve Gerber sees SA as hav-
ing two major functions. To pre-
sent the students' point of view in
university policy matters, is the
first. so that the administration will
not alone A be responsible for all
academic policy. The second is to
provide students with a good
scholastic and social atmosphere
and to provide for enough student
activities to interest as many
students as possible.

As a senior and part-time stu-
dent at SUNYA. Gerber puts in 50
to 60 hours a week at hispost for
which he receives a stipend which
works out to be“...about two cents
"an hour.“ In an interview. Gerber

In a further attempt to com-
municate how he felt about S.A.
student relations. Gerber stated.
“The entire group_ of student
relations has improved because the
S.A. has attempted to relate
students‘ interests to the ad-
ministration and Faculty. He went
on to add. “We think students at
this school are a definite interest
group and should be consulted
whenever policy is changed or new-
ly instituted. I believe students
should be consulted in order that
new policies will not be instituted
that will affect tile way we. as
students. will pursue oitr studies."

'l‘he obvious breakdown of any
legislative system is in the area of
communication between the com-

the executive power...

e.\p|ained his interest and his goals
concerning the Student Associa-
tion.

He prefaced by saying tltat lie
feels the students are the most ini-
porttint part of a university com-
murtity. When asked how be felt
relations between SA. and the
SlllllClllS \tcrc. (ierhct' replied.
“Relations with students have im-
proved irt the last few monthsandl
htipc signilicantly since last year."
In elaborating on this ptiirtt. he
pointed out that llarry Davis (S.A.
Vice Pres). Controller Kanarck
and liirnsell had attended every
summer Planning Ctinlerence iii art

Nevertheless. political pressure has
mounted. At the January 30

was proposed that would remove

dent and Vice-President because of
their alleged “undue inlluencc" in
Ctittrtcil affairs. Davis‘ response
at ' strong. “ll Council feels they
