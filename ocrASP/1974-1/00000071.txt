Politics of a

.The Central Council _is the
legislative branch of Student
Association. As such. it is responsi-
ble for the passage of all bills and
the statement of policies. and the
approval of the Central Council is
necessary for any bills to be
enacted. It must also maintain a
working relationship with the ex-
ecutive branch ofStudent Associa-
tion. which is able to introduce its
own bills as well as to veto anv
legislation passed by the Central

"Stu-dent Legislature ::

Chairperson Eric Lonschein of
Central Council feels that “S.A.‘s
pfimﬂl'l’ ' function is to provide ser—
vices that are necessary to make life
bearable at this giant concrete
slab." He feels also that the Central
Council has a right to speak out on
political. University. or other
matters of importance. On the part
of .thc members. however. there
“seems to he a reluctance to stick
their necks out." To illustrate his
point. Lonschein cited a resolirtion
calling for the impeachment of

its approval. The Student Associa-
tion. for the most part. deals with
recreational activities. concerts.

Eric Lonschein, Chairperson of Central Council. has been the subject of re-

cent controversy.
Ceritral Council‘s main purpose is
to lorniulatc the budget and deter-
mine what groups get landed and
in what amounts. It is the
President‘s duty to recommend a
udgct to the Councrl. but It is up
to the Council to approic that
budget. Various SA. groups may
present tlicrr'hudgctuig planstothc
executive branch or to Central
Council and have their cases corr-
stdercd.

To the Editor:

The recent unfortunate case of unethical
behavior committed by Student Association
officers and others during the stile of tickets
for the Miami bus trip has been compounded
by the misleadingand confusing lead story in
last Friday‘s ASP. Important facts correct-
ning the findings and reconimerrdritroiw ol
the committee were left out. and other tllilttir
points were clouded by the reporting style. In
the interests of the student body. the whole
truth of this matter needs to be presented. I
feel that the partial publication due to spttL'c
of the minutes ol the Central Councrl
meeting will best allow an impartial viewing
of the statements til the \ar'ious persons in-
volved. Eric l.onschcin has stated that the
student body knows that he's stillclctl
throuin enough punishment. I sincerely
hope that these tllltltllcs allow you. the sill-

someone into the Campus Center after it

Ken Stokcm asked how many people were
in the room. Eric Lonschein answered4plus
Chris Brown's girlfriend plus the 2 people
from room 308 plus the girl who had a cold.
Ken Slokem asked Eric if he was doing
work'.’ Eric Lonschein replied yes. his serious
intent was to do work.

Lew Fidler said he was very disappointed

with the committee. as it had turned it fact-
t'indirig investigation into a "witchhunt."
People should consider that Eric rlucxwork
for S.-t in the office It would only be to the
detriment of all students to throw Eric out of
thy: SA ofﬁce. and the same for the other peo-
ple charged. Eric tiotcd that he‘d learned a
"tremendous lesson,“ He thought that taking
the building privileges away would be
detrimental to all of SA. Steve Meyer rriadc
the following points about the previous dis-
ctissioiis: l) Fric‘s justification for lying tthat
the committee was slanted against llllltl was
not ialid. and that the case was more one ot
rrlor motion that had been very dariiagitrg to
