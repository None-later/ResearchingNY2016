The Energy Crisis:

A Controlled Result

by Douglas Le Comte

Though the environincntalistsaggravated
the eitergy crisis by, among other things.
delaying the building ofthe Alaskan pipeline
and holding up the construction of new
refineries. and the Arabs made a bad situa-
tion worse with their oil embargo, it is
becoming increasingly evident that federal
price controlsarc the main reason behind the
fuel shortage.

Free ~ market economists have known
and demonstrated for over a centurytthat
.government intervention in the marketplace
distorts supply and demand and {csults in
shortages and unemployment. and nowlhis
has been painfully proven as. after 28
months of price controls. America. one the
land of abundance. is running out of
everything from plastic toys to paper bags.
from tennis balls to antifreeze. from canned
foods to home freezers. And everyone is go-
ing around accusing everyone else for the
shortages but. when you come right down to
it. it becomes glarineg obvious that the
politicians and the government bureaucrats.
either through ignorance or last for power.
are to blame to the plethora of laws and
regulations which have so grievously dis-
torted the natural rhythms of the
marketplace.

Think about it. This nation has one A-
third of the world's supply of coal. New oil
reserves arc still being discovered all the
time. We have plenty of natural gas under
the ground. Why do we have a fuel crisis?
This cannot be in a free society. If a com-
modity diminishes. then the price will rise ac-
cording to supply and demand. thus dis-
couraging l’urtltcr consumption. If prices go
ltiglt. demand will cbh.and the prices must of
necessity go dowrt. “the prices arcltigh arid
dcntarid does not d iminislt due to the impor-
tance of the commodity. then new corti-
petilors will enter tltc lucrative market. supp-
ly will increase and the price goesdown. It is
thus highly unlikely tlial ricccssary supplies
ol artytltittg would runout in a free markct
socicty.

Noyt take the case of natural gas. A lctlcral
control agency has held the price ol natural
gas at the wellhead down forycars. The price
has hccn held down at and ially low lcvcls
to “protect” the consumer. Since profits have
been held down so low. tltc natural gas coni—
pttttics hayc had tto inccntivc to risk Iaigc
amounts of capital in new wcllstogct the gas
from the ground Why bother if the profits
do not make it woriltwliile'l'lhc result has
hcen that a most important fuel has been lett
unexploitcd. save lor Oklahoma. (his found-
in the statc and used solely in that state is not
subjected to tltc whims of tlt economic
tyrants of federal price commissions. so
()klahorita will have no blackouts or brow-i
tiouts this winter. as all the gas that is needed
is delivered to tire electric companies hit
their generation at power

The price of retail gasoline and fuel oil has
been held down since August l5. l97l by the
various economic phases. The reason was to
figltt inﬂation (Ha!) The result was that con-
sumption was encouraged and production
and expansion of capacity was discouraged.
Soi now we have a shortage ofgasolinc iind a
lot of people who dcpcrtd oii it are out of a
job.

Let us look closer at tltc fuel oil situation.
Prices were frozen in the summertime. Fuel
oil prices are. naturally. lower in the

in winter. Result: gasoline
became more profitable to prodtrcc than fuel
oil. hence a shortage of fuel oil. last winter.
well before tltc Arab embargo. we already
saw premature factory andschoolclosings in
lack of

summer than

parts of the country because of
heating oil.

Another example. Prices for llat steel and
pipes were frozen. The levels at which they
were controlled made it more prolitablc to
produce flat steel instead of pipes. Result.
pipe has been hard to get for drilling new
wclls.

Shortages have been cropping up actually
everywhere. A timber company in Oregon
can‘t get glue for making plywood duc to
petrochemical shortages and it can‘t get
enouglt natural gas and propane to dry its
wood. Maybe 20“ workers will he laid off.
Stories like this one are being repeated all
around tltc country at firms that can‘t get the
supplies they need due to shortages caused
by price controls

Izvctt the most ardent supporters ol price
controls coitccdcd last summer that hch
shortages were dtic to Iro/cti prtccs. making
it unprofitable to bring bccl cattlc lontarkct

by Bob Riedinger

While the ltopcs of any fttrtltcr
Crosby. Stills. Nash and Young
team up are always in the
process of disappearing. tltcrc is
something else which dims the out-
look held by (‘SNY enthusiasts.
Iltis damper is the increasingly in-
frequent solo album product to
come lront arty of the quartct‘s
members.

As it attempting to keep his spot
irt tltc public ear.(irabant Nash has
made inntimerablc appearances as
a background vocalist for many
other artists including Dave
Mason and .lorti Mitcltcll. But the
time ltas come for the return of
Nash‘s spotlight.

ll rlrl lu/i'i (Atlantic SI) 72%) is

runs that range. On the lively side
there‘s “Wild Tales.” the title cut

rockcr of the album and Dave‘

ly puts the power into it. Lindley
also saves “Grave Concern.“
creating true interest in contrast to
the artiﬁcial attempt in the same

song by voice montage. "Ohl‘

Camil (The Winter Soldier)“ is an
upbeat. accoustically driven
protest tune which features Dave
Mason on twelve string guitar. His
rhythmic support of Nash‘s voca|..
harmonica and accoustic guitar is
worthy of mention. especially
[when he uses his guitar to un-
I dcrscorc the words. or using it to
: rttakc audio exclamation points.

“()n the Linc" is one ol the best
cuts oit the album. and includes a
titcc progrcssioti that the piano and

round out Nash's vocal which he
also docs on “l'rison Song" ( a cut
“their brings to mind “(‘bicago")
attd oti “And So It Goes"
(which draws directly front the
itiood of the Nash Crosby
album).

Ilic soltcr songs are “I Miss

Nash is built rellcctuc arid then
momentarily excited on “I Miss

dicate tltts. ()ti “Another Slccp
