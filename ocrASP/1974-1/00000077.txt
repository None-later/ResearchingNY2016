Address To Small Gathering

by Richard McRobert
It was on Lincoln‘s Birthday that
Ramsey Clark. former Attorney-
General to Lyndon Johnson and
{timed defender. spoke to a polite
crowd which 'barely filled the seats
oi Lecture-Center iii. and he
wouldn't let them l'orgct il. Speak-
ing quietly l‘or less than an hour as
though lecturing one ol' his law
' classes at Brooklyn College. he cori-
centrated more on projecting an im-
age than on speciﬁc issues. Clark‘s
appeal was for what he believes is
needed in our government today.

rationality did the convincing.
Clark went on to explain how the
absence oi such a philosophy is

mon the courage to “seek something
better as ti libertttor of the human
condition from want".
l'tiiking plainly of compassion
rind strength. Clark emphasired the
legal side of our current situation.
He tltlrihutes most of the troubles to
misuse and misinterpretation of the
Constitution. It is the exercise ol'ar-
bitrtiry power tltat will destroy us.
Citing the New Deal period and the
Civil Rights movement as examples.
Clark expressed his desire for social
change to occur through new laws.
liuss‘ing is one case of the law be-
ing misused to support tire status
quo rather titan alter it, instead til
promoting integration. it made the
"world .s'alc lor hypocrisy“ by buss-
ing the races apart. Another rtbtisc
ol the law was pointed otrl In its tiri-
cqttal application to the dillcriiig
social and cctiriomic classes.
Ramsey Clark knows. lic‘s bccn lti

who could not pay [or his scniccs.
Among tlicssc are tlic Indians. the

Clark stressed the importance of
judging such emotional issues on
the facts. the evidence ath nd. With
this in mind. he related the attempt
to impeach William 0. Douglas
when the Supreme Court Justice

censored according to I‘irst Amend-
ment rights.

Clark received one lively response
during the evening. as he attacked
those who say an impeachable

House ol’ Representatives" says it is

ponder what shape we would be in if
