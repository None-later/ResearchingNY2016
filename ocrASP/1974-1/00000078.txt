There is at least one corporation
whose purpose is strictly
humanitarian. It 5' name is Refer
Switchboard. Inc. Its purpose - to
help people of the Capitol District
with problem of any kind.
Organized 4 years ago by local
people. Refer Switchboard is a 24
hour crisis intervention center. For
the past three years it had been
housed in a building on Hudson
Avenue. The Switchboard has
recently] moved across the street into
a 2 story house at 339 Hudson.Two
big friendly dogs. Fred rind Sam.
greeted me on arrival at the old.
well-kept house with a small orange
REFER sign on the door. The
livingroom is furnished with
phones. couches. ﬁling cabinets and

»r.

a huge bulletin board ﬁlled with
headings of major problem areas
and their code numbers (a way of
identifying and compiling statistics
on problem areas and community
needs more efficiently).
As soon as I sat down someone
picked up the phone. spoke for a
- mintite. then called. “Does anybody
have a car?" An “I do" followed by
the appearance of Nowell crime
from the other room. "OK. OK.
Can you go to the airport to pick up
Ramsey Clark? He needs a lift.
Nowell rushed out arid a tall beard-
ed guy called Frabis by his friends.
sat down with me and tried to ex—
plain some of the services Refer
offers. how it works. and what its
basic philosophy is.
lhe conversation was relaxed and

natural. Occassionally the phone

rang. Someone called for a drug ID.
I’eople came in and out of the room.
Everyone said hello, but left. it a
private conversation. Frabis ex-
plained- that Refer is basically a
rel'eral service that tries to help peo-
ple with problems that are either un-
aivare of existing forms of
assistance or find themselves in a
situation where no assistance is
available to them. He emphasized
the point that as a crisis service they
provide a comfortable, nonconfron-
ting atmosphere for the pers'on in
[crisis where the experience can be
dealt with. They do not moralize;
they help. Frabis put it simply. “If
there‘s a resource we‘ll ﬁnd it or try
to make it."

Information is available on
everything from drugs. medical and
personal crises to facts on residence
codes in the area and legal rights of
minors. Some of the calls involve a
Iovers‘ quarrel. a lonely or suicidal
person. out-of-towners looking for
1 place to crash for the night. and
(id‘s who want to know if there‘s a
tood band or movie playing in
town.

lhc majority of calls that come in
are Irorn people between it) and 28
years old, However. the numbers of
calls from anxious parent_s and
senior citizens in the area are in-
creasing. An average 0 75 calls
come in every day and the phones
are manned 24 hours a day. seven
days a week. to help people who
want help. _

A core stail oi I2 members deal
mainly with the actual calls. At least
one of them is on hand at all times.
About 25 other active members help
out with the phones, do Public
Relations work in the community,
follow-up calls and keep track of
statistics on major problems areas
and information ﬁles. In addition.
various professional people and
concerned community members
provrdc help when it is needed. The
Refer staff represents a cross-section
of the community. High school and
college students. secretaries. nurses.
teachers. mechanics. drop-outs.
social workers psychologists. street
people. parents - all types of people
are involved in various aspects of
tlic organixatiori.‘ Counselors.social

workers. ministers,
other professional people donate
