. FEO. . V

The correct answers depend on
‘which of the FEO's I0 regional
headquarters the homeowners asks.
Unless he lives-in Boston.

“I don‘t think he can do it. l never
heard of it.” said a spokesman at the
FEO‘s New England ofﬁce.

The confusion about
homeowners and heating oil was
typical of the varied and often con-
tradictory responses from FEO
regional offices to a series of iden-
tical questions related to the energy
crisis.

The questions dealt with federal
regulations and policy. not state or
local situations. Answers came from
regional administrators or public af-
fairs ofﬁcers. In most cases, they
were off-the-cuff replies. not for-
mally prepared responses. The of-
ﬁcials did not know their answers
would be compared with those of
other FEO offices.

Does the federal government now
have the power to ration gasoline?

“No. I don't think so,” said the in-
formation ofﬁcer at the Atlanta
headquarters.

“I think it does." said a New York
ofﬁce spokesman.

“it is possible that gasoline
rationing may be implemented un-
der the Emergency Defense Produc-
tion Act." said the regional ad-
ministrator in Seattle.

The question was posed to the
FEU in Washington. “It doesn‘t
have the power to ration." said a
spokesman.

Ile called brick.

“ [here is some confusion about
that." he said. “The position is that

we would prefer to have speciﬁc
authority from Congress."

Who handles complaints about
gasoline or home fuel prices?

“Theyl contact the Internal
Revenue Service," said the San
Francisco office.

“They can either call us or the
IRS." said the Philadelphia head-
quarters.

“This is the place." said a
spokesman in the Atlanta ofﬁce.

The FEO in Washington said
such complaints should go'to the

economic stabilization section of
the IRS.

All the regional ofﬁces agreed
there was no way for service station
operators to give preferentiaftreaﬁ
ment to regular customers at the
gasoline pumps. But there was some
debate about exactly what that
meant.

“He can't discriminate, but he can
go ahead in a way in which he can
take care of his own regular
customers." said the Atlanta office.

An FEO spokesman in Dallas
reached for the regulations: “Let me
read to you. If they have as it nor-
mal business practice before the
mandatory allocation program a
relationship of providing certain
preferential treatment in connection
with the sale of products to com-
mercial accounts or bulk commercial
accounts. they may continue to
serve people in that manner.“

"Commercial people can get
preferential treatment simply
because they are commercial, but
there's got to be tio disciirrination,"
said the Boston office.

For the average citi/cn. just ask-
ing the regional HiOa question can
he a problem.

Ask the local information
operator for the telephone number
of the Federal firrcrgy Office in

While newly —— formed faculty
unions battle with their ad-
ministrations. students nationwrde
have found themselves left out in
the cold on bargaining that will
determine their class size,
curriculum. tuition and academic
freedom. I

Declining enrollments. a poortob
market and tight university budgets
have put many professors out on the
picket line, ﬁghting in a new way for
their academic lives. The faculties of
more than 2I2 institutions have
been organized into some kind of
collective bargaining arrangement.

Student bargaining units have not
grown proportionally. Only the in-
dependent student union at
Stockton State in New Jersey has
remained viable for any length of
time. That union recently
negotiated a contract with the
American Federation of Teachers
local to protect students during a
threatened strike by New Jersey
professors.

forms. They are an end user." said
the Denver ofﬁce.

“He doesn‘t come under the
regulations.” said the New York of-
ﬁce. “He has to go to the state.“

How can a service station
operator apply for an increased gas-
oline allocation?

“He fills out a Form I7. It goes to
the supplier. If the supplier Qlts it.
that's as far its it goes. He gets the
staff." said the Iioston office.

fice. A Form 17. We Irate them."
said the Denver office.

“He goes to his supplier." the
Dallas office said. “Sometimes the

Much of the problem stems "'0!"
the fact that neither students,
faculties, nor administrations have
been entirely clear on their roles in a
framework traditionally more
suited to industry than academia.

“Some hold that universities and
unions bytheir very nature are in-
compatible.“ commented a faculty
union leader at the State Universrty
of Buffalo. “A university operates
on a collegial model. while a union
is based on an adversary model with
management and staff set against
each other."

If students are to ﬁt into this
traditional adversary model. many
have asked. whose adversary are
they?

Students at the Fitchburg State
College in Massachusetts were
allowed to participite as a third
party in faculty v administration
negotiations. However. the students
found that both the faculty and ad-
ministration wanted them to
bargain against the other party.

The issue was somewhat clearer
when in I970 teaching assistants at
the University of Wisconsin
bargained as principals in
negotiations with the administra-
tion over Iengtli oI appointment. job
security. work load and class size.
The same year part ~ time student
employees at the Univesity of
Oregon were legally recognized as a
bargaining unit in a dispute over
working conditions.

Yet in both of these cases.
students negotiated primarily as
employees. it stipulation that most
labor relations statutes require to
authori/c collective bargaining.
