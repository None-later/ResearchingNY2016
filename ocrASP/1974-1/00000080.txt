Bright carpets and wall markings
radiate against the otherwise placid
interior. Reds. yellows. royal blues.
greens and purples crop up
everywhere including on the pipes in
the boiler room. A “recirculation

betore a meeting of the Select Com-
mittee on Higher lidtieation. SASU
I‘cutsltlllvc Director Ray Glass and
legislative Aide Babs Ranagttn
charged that New York State ranks
among the lowest in the nation in
pct capitii support lor' public higher
education. and that tltc |:\l’
proposal being prtlltltllt‘ti h.‘ PH“Ilc

s iyst is not opposed to the idea ol‘
indirect aid to piiyate collgegs as irt

stich and should be cotiplcd with'
assurances that the state will con-
tiriiie to adequately lurid public
schools. that piiyatc colleges will
make tlieiiisclyes more accountable
to the public. and that there will be
no decrease in the amount ol aid
giyen to public school sttidcnls.

lhc legislatiyc director claimed
that New York‘s liriaricial commit»
merit to public higher education is
inadequate. and that the State ranks
47th in pct-capita expenditures for
state institutions ol higher educa-
ttoii. (ilass also told the legislators
that only New Hampshire and Ver-
