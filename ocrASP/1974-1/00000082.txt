A ROYAL HUNT

The attack on the king is the
most decisive attack in chess.
Games of this sort usually
end soon after the attack has
begun. In some of these at-
tacks. the enieny king is
marched clear across the
board. and usually ends up be-
ing mated there. Therefore
only with great care should a
king be moved into the middle
01' the board. (However.
Charles 11 of Sweden. who
was a military genius. being
the king of Sweden liked to
move his king more than any
other piece. But it is doubted
that he won many chess
games.) Witness the royal
iiunt in the first game:

Solution to

MM. 7

‘JiCH i, 1974

South plays in 6 spades
after East makes an opening
bid of 1 heart. See if you can
spot the error with South's
plan of play.

Alter West opens the nine of
hearts. East wins and plays a
second high heart. which
South ruffs with the Ten.
South then pulls a round of
trumps and is only mildly up-
set when he sees that West
started with all three outstan~
dingr trumps. South then
cases the A. K of diamonds.
then returns to hand by first
playing the King and then
Am: of clubs. A club is ruffed.
a spade is played to the King
and the last side suit loser is
ruffed iii the open hand. South
has cooked his own goose! If
he returns to his hand by ruf-
fing a heart. Westoveri'uffs. If
instead South plays his
master Li'uinp on this trick.
West's Jack is promoted to ii.

winner in good standing to
defeat the contract.

South's error was his initial
play of trumps at trick three.

South can see that his con- _

tract is in jeopardy only if
spades are split 3—0. He must
therefore take the necessary
precaution of delaying the ex-
traction of trumps until all
ihis club and diamond losers
and ruffed out. After this.
dummy has a final trump
which can be played to pull
the last of West's teeth.

Of course. nothing more than
a good case of pessimism or
forethought
success 01' the contract. There
is no way to acquire this wild-
ly desired "disease" of an-
