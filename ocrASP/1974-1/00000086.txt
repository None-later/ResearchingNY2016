fNow More Than Ever

The House Judiciary Committee this week issued a deﬁnitive statement outlining
what it would consider to be an impeachable offense. In a rather broad interpretation
of the Constitutional provisions, it has ruled that an abuse of Presidential power, not
merely a criminal act, would constitute grounds for impeachment. Furthermore, it
appears that this decision closely captures the spirit and intent of the framers of the
Constitution,just as it confortns to the “abuse or power“ precedents upon which most
other impeachment proceedings against Federal officials have been based. Yet, in his
most recent news conference, President Nixon. in a not-so-astonishingly narrow view
ofthe Constitutional provisions, has argued that his impeachment could be based only
upon criminal mis-conduct in ofﬁce. It is, indeed. a strange and unique spectacle to see
a man under investigation in a position to delineate and prescribe the conditions under
which he might be investigated. It is obvious that Mr.Nixon hasnot only alpartisan in-
terest in limiting the scope ofthe inquiry, but an equally strong personal interest in the

outcome, as well.

It is to be hoped that the House. in conducting the inquiry into the President‘salleg—
ed misconduct, will display no such partisan attitude. For the President‘s actions to be
given all due consideration, all political interests must be laid aside. It is also to he
hoped that Mr. Nixon will co-operate fully with the Committee so that this matter may
beexpeditiouslyandjudiciousfyresolved. It is in the best interests of'all coiicerned.and
and especially for the country at large, to press for a quick and fair resolution of'tliis
contplicated matter, so that the innocent will be exonerated and the guilty removed
front office. Mr. Nixon‘s evasivcness and his uncooperative stanceonlyjeopardize his
own chances, as the country cannot come to the inescapable conclusion [Ital the Presi-
dent has something to hide rind has abused his power in the process of its coitc 'alment.
ft is necessary, now more than ever. for the President to be fully investigated on the
grounds the Constitution specifically provides. '

Give Us This Day

  

New York State is endingi

' first full week under the new gasoline rationing plan ini-

posed by Governor Wilson,which had already been in mandatory effect in Westchester
and Nassau Counties. The plan, which had been voluntary in New York City. called
for the alternation of odd-even license plates with odd-even numbered dates of the
month, which, it was hoped. would eitd the chaotic and economically disastrous lines

waiting for gasoline.

Reports filtering in since Monday indieatethat thc rationing system is havingat least
a partial effect on the formerly intolerable litres at Albany and Colonic area gas
stations. While waits ofan hour or longer were reported before the February vacation,
with lines of (>0 cars or more not uncommon. students now find that waits varied from
virtually non-existent to a maximum of half an hour.

While it is still too early to assign all the credit for thedrainaticallyimproved gas
situation, we can safely assume that the rationing plan hits helped. It is unfortunate
that built into the system is a clause making it mandatory for motorists to have less
than a half tank of gas when they pull into a service station. It is also unfortunate that
no provisions were made to require gas station attendants to remain open froniat least
ft am. to f) p.iit.. rather than the prcsctit situation where owners are opened fora more
profitable short period of trnie when motorists are forced to scramble to available

stations.

lthtiI enough time passes for the state to take stock of the effects of the new plant
motorists should not be surprised if spot shortages arid price gotigiiig persists. Ilte
federal government‘s gasolineallocation program, while severely insufficient iii terms
of the fuel needs of New York, nevertheless is flexible enough to allow even small iii-
creiiientrrf increases, such as the extra two million gallons that Governor Wilson was
able to get from Washington. While glib assurances from President Nixon that our
fuel crisis is over (while his energy chief Williiiitt Simon warns ofii possible 30% shor-
rage in fuel for March). we can hope that the Congress will now trike action to supple-
ment the limited measurcs that the individual states are able to make.

Art at or» the board rollback of crude oil prices, as Senator Ilenry Jackson of
Washington State has proposed, migfit Just turn the tide in the battle this nation hits
waged against its tight fuel problem,

There is no energy crisis, possibly a shortage.

To the Editor:

The ASI’ has, in the past. been highly
critical of many of the flaws that make Stu-
dent Association and student governance in
getteral an imperfect mechanism of represent

these organi/iitions often are of the ASI’. it
would be impossible for any of us to deny
that we are indeed far from perfect. The
errors of our ways are numerous and some
appear to beinhereiit in the system. However.
the fact remains that many ofthe problems of
student goveritancc do have apparent cures.
It is toward the eitd of applying tltese cures
that a new organization has been formed. the
United Student Front.
