Are The Oil Companies
To Blame?

by Douglas LeComte

Taken For A Ride.

As it was pointed otit recently in the New
l'ur/y' Timcs‘t “It is the ideal time for
pedestrians and joggers.“ With the winter and
the fuel shortage dragging on in dangerous
consort. the country was witness to the

the large fraction of the coriiniutors who rely
on the SUNYA bus to shuttle them to catn-
pus and back again. Slowly. but tin-

would they now conspire to create a shor—
tage? Why did they wait so long to rip offthe
“helpless” consumer?

Second. the talk about the huge excess
proﬁts the oil companies have been making is
largely an exercise in how to lie with
statistics. Usually I972 is compared with 1973
to show a huge gain in proﬁts. but l972 was
the least profitable year of the post-war
period. The profit issue is important because
it is the la‘“ z-faire cconomists‘ contention
that profits have been held too low by price
controls to induce development of new
energy resources. After—tax profits frorti
petroleum reﬁning are. according to Alan
Reynolds. tin associate editor of National

 

gasoline available, and the independents will
have difﬁculty obtaining fuel or be faced with
much higher prices. Many stations therefore
will have to close up shop.

The oil companies are not entirely
blameless. While they say they believe in free
enterprise they have been clamoring for tax
beneﬁts and import restrictions. If they were
more con. stent perhaps they would win
more sympathy fiom the public. In fact.
businessmen have often been in the forefront
of those clamoring forgovcrtimcnt intervent-
tioit in the economy. This is one reason why
we do not have capitalism in thiscountry btit
instead. a mixed economy. half free enter-
prise and half government controlled. The

SUNYA is moving toward implementation
