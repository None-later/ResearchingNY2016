F.

Wrestlers Fifth in

 SUN YA Cs

by Kenneth Arduino

The most successful Albany
wrestling team ever, received
some misfortune the past two
Weekends as they closed out
their season. Some kley injuries
hampered the matmen as they
ﬁnished ﬁfth in the SUNYACS.
These injuries also hampered the
team the following week in the
New York State Cham-
pionships, where the team
finished seventh.

The Danes went into the
SUNYACS with their best
record ever. They had hoped _to
finish as well or better than last
year‘s fourth. But lady luck had
another plan as they tied Cor-
tland for fifth with ten teams
competing.

On the bright side of the
ledger was the wrestling of
heaveywcight Rudy Vido. For
the second straight year he won
tfie heavyweight title, A 10-5 vic-
tory in the final round gave the
(i‘_‘“ 240 pourider a berth in the
NCAA division Il cham-
pionships this weekend. It also

totitrnued his undefeated
season,
lhe otfier two undefeated

wrestlers were less fortunate.
l,.irry Minis. I92 poundcr. kept
his streak going before losrrig in
the final round. Larry's loss gave
him a second place filllSIl. Also
undefeated. wrestler Walt Katz
saw his streak go by the boards
as he lost in a preliminary
rrratcli.

lo add to the probletris were
two key injuries suffered by
Albaiiy wrestlers. Doug Bauer
(fti7) hurt his shoulder in an
overtime match. Dori Mion..

who was on of the last wrestlers
to lose his undefeated season,
suffered a knee injury. Both men
were counted on to supply need-
ed points and their loss put
Albany at a severe disadvantage.

One week later the team
travelled to Rochester for the
New York State Cham-
pidnsbips. A strong ﬁeld was in-
vited and the injury ﬁddled
Danes had some tough com-
pany. In fact the top three teams
in this tournament all finished
ahead of the Danes at the
SUNYACS.

Larry Mims was top man for
Albany as he again won all his
tnatches until he reached the
final round where he was

defeated. The back to back
seconds in two real tough meets
is an outstanding accomplish-
ment. Larry‘s second was also
high finish for a capital district
representative as both Union
and RPI were invited. Union
finished behind the Danes in
eighth) RPI last in a ﬁeld of
eighteen.

Rudy Vido dropped out of the
undefeated ranks as he lost and
finished fifth. For Rudy, though
there is still the big match this
weekend to look forward to in
the NCAA championship. For
the rest the season is over and
even though there were a couple
of bad breaks at the end. this
could not damper the sucess that
this year‘s team enjoyed.

could only manage a 45-42 half-
time lead. Carrying the offensive
brunt was Reggie Smith, who
was six for nine from the ﬁeld.
and Mike Supronowicz. who
was four for ﬁve. Team scoring
leader, Byron Miller, managed
but one field goal in the first
half.

An omen of things to come
came with Albany’s ﬁrst shot of
the second half. as Byron
duplicated his ﬁrst half totals.
After exchanging baskets.
Byron adjusted to the fact that
his outside shot was off as he hit
two quick baskets off offensive
rebounds. After :1 Harry John—
son lay-up. Byron hit four more
baskets to open up the Danes‘
lead to ten points. New Paltz
was able to stay in the game
because of guard Dave Hudson.
who scored thirty-two points.
twenty of which came in the se-
cond half.

The Danes were controlling
the boards but shots Were not
dropping and New Paltz was
able to ctit the lead to five with
about six minutes to go in the
grime.

But twelve straight Albany
points put the game out of
reach. Harry Johnson scored 0
of them. giving him a new career

high of twenty-two points.
Johnson's last basket in the
streak gave Albany ninety-six
points, one short of their own
University scoring record. Mel
Brown took care of that when he
hit a twenty-ﬁve footer and then
followed it up with a break away
lay-up as Albany reached the
one—hundred plateau mark for
the first time.

Individual stars were aplenty
for the Danes. Harry Johnson‘s
twenty-two points was game
Itiin and he also contributed
sortie real good rebounding;

points and twelve rebounds.

Swimmers Lose

by Rob (ieier

“This has to be the unltl2kiest
team ever". gasped swimming cap-
taitr I.en Van Ryn in a frustrated
voice. Frustration is the key word
for it team that consistently wins in
the swimming events and then loses
meets due to a fifteen point
giveaway in diving. 'l‘his swimming
strength should reap its benefits in
the SUNYAC Championships next
week. but went unheralded as the
team lost all three meets held over
the last two weeks.

On Saturday. February 16 the
team traveled to Wildes-Barre to
lose 03-49 iii it meet against Kings
College. llic tneet was highlighted
by quick tiriies iii a number of'races.
Srcbeckei rind Masorni placed one-
two in the 200 yard freestyle. Rubin
swamped his opponent to win the
200 yard butterfly. Masom's steady
acin allowed him to defeat a tir-

   

ing King's swimmer for a first in the
200 backstroke. Van Ryn and
Dudley continued their winning
ways by placing first in the 500 yard
freestyle and 200 ard breastroke
respectively.

February 20 the reant lost to
Bridgewater State 59—54 iri what was
the closest meet of the three. Ken
Weber proved to be the outstanding
swimmer of the meet by placing sc-
corid in the 200 yard freestyle JUSl
after placing second in the grueling
|000 yard freestyle. It was ati ltd-
mirabfc feat' of endurance to swim rt
forty lirp race and then two minutes
later to sprint the eight lap 200 with
a time of 2:0|.5. Ken rounded olf a
fine. day by placing second to Van

Freshman Student Seized
On ‘No-Knoek’ Warrant;-
Marijuana Taken In Raid

Claim Cops Sought Acid

by Mike Sen:

AlbanyCity l’olicc. carrying a “no—
knock“ warrant. arrested an Alumni
quad resident for possession of mari-
jtiaiia last Tuesday.

the strident. ti freshman in Alden
“it” on the downtown campus. was
arraigned on a Class C felony and is
awaiting trial.

According to Neil Brown. Dean
for Student Affairs. ithe action by
plarriclotlics officers of the Albany
Police Department was not revealed
to (‘iimpus Securityortotlie Univer-
sity Admtrtistrittion prior to the
arrest. lhat action was a “departure
front understandings which have ex-
isted for several years between
SUNYA administrators and local
and state authorities." Brown stated.

Student ('liiims Harmssment

llie arrested student asserts that
lie was har'rrtsscd by the arresting of-
ficers. llcallegcs that he handed over
the marijuana upon demand. but
that the officers then “took the place
apart on the suspicion that there
might be narcotics other than mari-
juana" on the premises.

According to the student. the
policeman told liim that they were
“looking for 1000 hits til acid." then
proceeded to dump out his dresser
drawers. tear down posters and up-
end his desk. No LSD was found.

In describing the event. the stu-
dent. whose name is being withheld
because he is a minor. alleged that
the police "roughed" hint up. "Four
narcs came to the door and two
others stood outside." he said. IIt
claims they first asked him where his
roommates were. Ilc told IIlCl‘ll‘lhﬂl
they had “split to study". The of-
ficer's then proceeded to cotrduct an
liour-nnd»a-half search and
questioning

A hrillnratc said the police left a
note on the door of the student who
was busted According tti that stu—
dent. the note iciid: “'I'his room has
been raided Atty urtnuthorilcd per»
sotincl entering the room Will be
arrested. l'rrr tlict drug investigations
will be made.“ lfie note wtisallegcd-
I) signed “the iiiir'cs.“ Mike Axelrod.
an RA on the floor. conﬁrmed what
the student said. Axclrod said. “It
Iookcd like a teri-year-old wrote the
note." Another r'c11dent remarked.
“lici'yone thought it was a joke."

Only In "Understanding"

When questioned on the matter.
Security Director Jim Williams said
that this was the ﬁrst time this year
art outside agency has arrested a
SUNYA student.. According to
Williams. Security doesn‘t have sole
jurisdiction on this campus. "Out of
courtesy" the City Police may advise
Security of pending action. but they
do not fluf‘l‘ to. Speaking further of
‘t he case. Williams added.
“Anything we can tell you would be
speculation." It was “entirely their
[Albany City Police) case.“

Dean Brown concurred with the
statement regarding the informing of
University personnel prior to action.
He said that there is art understan-
ding with the Albany l’olice Depart-
ment that in the event ofan arrest.
someone from the residence staff
should be present. He noted.
Ittiwc\cr. that this is just an un-
derstanding. Brown further stated.
“I would hope that students will be
riiorc aware of tliicr vulnerability."

Knrlccn Kiirlson. Alumni Quad
('oordinttltir. said that in the fotir
years she has been downtown. “I
can't recall" the last drug bust by
City Police. She added that "we had
no prior information" about the
bust,

No Ivory Tower

According to Karlson. the drug
arrest will “scare a lot of kids."“We
aren't art ivory tower. we don't live
apart from the community." she
added. She went on to say that she
would be “very surprised" if there
was another bust downtown. She
added. however. that “people can't
assume that since we area University
wer'e are exempt from outside
authority.“
