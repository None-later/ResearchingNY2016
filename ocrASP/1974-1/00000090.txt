nion as the major‘clltld. Faculty
Student'Assocjation head Norbert
Zahm told the ASP that beginning
next semester. on — campus
residents will be able to purchase
Lunch — Dinner-meal cards with
an option forbreakt‘aston Sunday.

Zahm said that student reac-
tion had ﬁltered in through reports
submitted 'by the six food coni-
mittees onvcampus. .The ﬁve in-
dividual quad food evaluations
committees. plus the Food Ad-
visory Committee outlined
proposals to alleviate sutdent com-
plaints that Sunday presents a
severe inconvenience to students
on the Lunch —— Dinner imeall plan
since no meal is available to them
until dinner time.

The Food ‘ LAdvisory Com-
mittee is.'compo'sed of the chair-
mean of each of the ﬁve quad food
committees‘plusla member from
Central Council and the student
Association.

According to the present meal
plan, holders of the Lunch —
Dinner arrangement are entitled to
II! meals — seven djnners and six
lunches. The cost forkhat contract
is 56”. According to 'Zahm. the
Sunday Breakfast option for the
LD eards'will increase that price to
$630; a fee which he termed “Well
worth the money."

When approached with the con-
tract change, reactions from resi-
dent students was generally
favorable One student said that he
really didn‘t miss lunch on Sun-

day’s since. as he put it.l“l don't
come down from Saturday night
until around three in the afternoon
anyway.“

Most reaction however, was
more typified by another student
who said. “It really is inconvenient
to go without food from dinner
Saturday until dinner Sunday. It‘s
like I have to fast a whole day every
week. Once a year is quite enough
for me.“ ‘

Students didn't seem to object,

strongly to the price hike. saying
that the sixteen dollars was worth
the end to grumbling protestations
from their ravenous stomachs.

Students will be able to purchase
the new meal contract when they
sign up for dormitory space at the
end of the semester.

Mrs. Meir had telephoned President Ephriam Katnr earlier and told him
she would call on him to return her mandate to form a new Israeli govern-
ment because of criticism of the new minority cabinet she had lined up.

PARIS (AP) Police, ﬁremen and ofﬁcial investigators combed through a
wide forest area today seeking bits of wreckage from a Turkish Airlines DC—

history. _ .

Experts estimated that a careful search of the area covering several square
miles might take'a week. Only part of the black box with Vital recordings of
the plaine's functioning has been found and top priority is being given to ﬁn-
ding other pieces.

Personal effects of the passengers were being piled together. Bits of
clothing caught in tree branches waved forlornly in the light wind.

The newspaper France-Soir said it had received two anonymous telephone
calls saying that “this was done voluntarily. It was definitelyrin attack." The
two calls seemed to come from the same man who claimed he was a member
of the “Liberal Front." which he said was a political movement started out-
side France. There was no way of conﬁrming his statements.

Class Governments: In The Wake Of The Chaos

by Charles Prichard
In the aftermath of the recent
Miami bus trip controversy. there
has been much confusion itboutthc
governing bodies of this university.
One of the major issues which
arises is the construction of the
fotir classes. Just what rules and
regulations do they work under?
Are there any regulations other
than moral restrictions, controlling
them‘! What allows situations such
as the Miami Bus. Trip to occur?
These tire all questions which need
to be answered.

Not all of the classes are struc-
tured in similar manners but there
are some similarities among some
of the classes. The Freshman.
Sophomore rind Senior Classes all
conduct meetings in which a ma-

jority decision is needed to approve
a motion that has been presented.
Each of these classes also calls
meetings at designated times to get
together to discuss the current
status of the concerned class.
Before the recent Miami con-
troversy. however. the only class to
have a written constitution was the
Freshman Class. Dave Lutzger,
President of the class. explained
that the constitution was written.
with the aid of advisers. at several
publicized meetings held prior to
the December elections and copies
were mailed out to rill members
prior to the election. Thisconstitu~
tion. however. was not acceptable
to Barry Davis. SA Vice Presi-
dent. because it lacked an im-
peachment clause. It is currently

being revised to include some need-
ed changes.

The basic outline of this con-
stituliori was explained byILutzgcr
He noted “any expetidiiurcs must
be approved byri simple imrijority‘v
of class members‘at a meeting.
I‘lierc are mandatory ntonthly
meetings to be held and he said that
“I can call one at my discretion.“
Lutzker was concerned about the
recent chaos created by the Miami
trip and he emphasized that “We‘re
goingto be careful nothing like the
Miami problem happens to us."

Recently. Davis Iiiiscrilled l'orrill
classes to submit consititulions. in
response to the chaos created by
the controversy. The Classes of
‘74. rind ‘75. have had their
budgets lrozrtn until they submit

Davis said that “there is ab-
solutcly no class board." He in-
dicated that as far as he was con-
ccrncd. the classes without con-
situtions did “not exist.“ In these
classes. according to Davis. there is
no niclhod for recrtll or impeach-
ment.

The class ofﬁcers. before the re-
cent concern with the establish-
ment ol~ constitutions. acted utider
what Dave Joss. Sophomore Class
President. called “more or less a
moral restriction.“ There were.
however. some guidelines.

The Senior Class operated tinder
a “majority vote system." Jeff
Bernstein. President of the Class.
ckpulincd the decision making
process which he uses. There must
be it majority vote of 3 out ol'4 of-
Iiccrs on rt decision for rrtiy issue

for organizing or selling tickets.“
The three other ofﬁcers. Allen Alt-
man. Bonnie Redder and Bob Kat-
trin. voted on the issue and com-
prised a majority, thereby allowing
passage of the issue.

Linda Weinstock. President of
the Junior Class. stressed the im—
portance of having a constitution
tor each class. She indicated that
each class “should draw up their
own.“ Weinstock was concerned
about next year's Senior Class and
she emphasized that it was “impor-
tritit for the Junior Class to be able
to move to a structured Senior
Class.

.Ioss explained the structure of
tire Sophomore Class. which is
very similar to the Senior Class.
He noted that there is a “lot of
lrcedom" in the present system.
Regarding tltc Miami issue. Joss
said that he was contacted by the
Senior (‘lriss ritid asked to “go in
