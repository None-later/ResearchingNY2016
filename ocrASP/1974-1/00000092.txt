by John Christ

(This is a two-part series on the
legal efforts to abolish mandatory
activity fees at some of the nation‘s
colleges and universities. and about
the impact such an action could have
on student activity programming.)

(Part l deals with the legal cases
‘involved.)

A legal battle which may ultimate-
ly have a profound effect on all stu-
dent activities and organizations. in-
cluding student governments and
newspapers. is being waged across
the country. The collection of man-
datory activity fees is being opposed
on manycampusesand in the courts.

Currently. student activities and
organizations at most colleges and
universities are funded by trian-
datory activity fees collected from
students at registration for each
academic term. The money is
allocated by collegeadministratiorts.
student governments. special com~
mittecs set up within non-profit cor-
porations established to handle the
funds. or ii combination of these.
Such funds pay for everything from
the student newspaper and student
government. through student
athletics. down 0 new sets for the
chess team.

However. across the country a
number of suits have been brought
against the collection of mandatory
activity fees. and while none ofthern
has been successful so far. they in-
dicate a trend of thought that may
radically alter the funding ofstudent
activities.

Most of the casesairgue that since
students are forced to pay activity
lees. they are thus forced to finan-
cially support activities they may be
against. such as student new

Stereo audiophiles are always on the lookout lor new developments in sound and
LAFAYETTE RADIO has one that's really attracting music-Iovers' attention. It‘s the

editorials and student government
actions inconsistent with the
political viewpoints of some
students.

A major proponent of the aboli-
tion of mandatory activity fees is the
conservative Young Americans for
Freedom (YAF). YAF opposes
mandatory activity lees because the
money raised through them often
goes to non-conservative interests.

A memorandum to state chairman
of YAF in April. I972 stated.
“Where the student government is
left-wingtas it is in 9 of |0case5). the
money is spent to produce campus
speakers programs with it IO orZOto
one ratio of liberal or radical
speakers to conservative speakers. to
fund radical student newspapers. or
to futrd left—wing student groups or
projects."

It went on to claim that. “Many
lelt-vving groups and projects across
the country depend on student lees
involuntarily paid. and would cease
to eyist without the subsidy provided
by the mandatory fee.“

According to wllllftllJ ('urr’rrc. a
publication oi YAF's Legal Action
Committee. YAF plans to oppose
mandatory fees with the goal of es-
tablishing a "rational" definition of
“extracurricular activities." or until

a system ol voluntary pay merits is es-
tablished. While YAl- is by no means
involved in all of the cases. the
organi/ation or its members have
been involved in most oi them.

District Judge llermiin
rtiled against a requested Injunction
to prohibit the 'l‘ev'rur from printing

Scientists Pressing for I
Release of Nixon Report

Frustrated scientists are pressing
the Nixon Administration to release
a long-suppressed report that
recommends a substantial increase
in funds to support heart research
and education at each ofthe nation's
medical schools.

The report. which was prepared
by a special President's Advisory
Panel on Heart Disease in I972. has
been bottled up ever sincc.appurcnt—
ly because its liberal spending
recommendations run counter to the
Administration‘s desire to keep
lederal spending in check.

A copy oi the report was obtained
recently by The Chronicle. higher
education's weekly newspaper. llie
report contains do/ctis oi

Evaders Still Being Prosecuted

is still vigorouly pursuing and

cvaders. ,

As of Jan. i. there were H.000
men in some form oftrouble because
ot draft evasion. Selective Service
records show. In addition. the
Department of Defense has listed
32.000 military desertersat lrirgc and
the National lnlerreligious Service
Board for Conscientious Objectors
has estimated that when all
categories of violations are cori-
sidercd. there are 400.000 men who
encountered legal corn-

that amnesty would weaken such
siipport. He also feels that to grant
an amensty would be an admission
that the war was wrong. and would
lead persons in the future to refuse to
serve.

in the iirst six months since the
President‘s draft authority lapsed.
1479 men were tried and convicted of
draft evasion. according to Justice
Department records. Because the
Defense Department now refuses to
accept the enlistment of accused
draft evaders. a policy change from
previous years. those being brought
to trial and facing probable convic-
tion have no possibility til escaping
legal penalties. This policy was
spelled otrt iii a directive sent to US.

authority to draft men.

Currently all men must register at
age I8 and those receiving a lottery
number below 95 in the annual
lottery drawings. are being classiﬁed
l-A. l’ ‘lICC organirations have noted
that men who receive a l-A
classification often volunteer forser-
vice under the false impression that
they are about to be drafted.
However. draft can only be
reinstated through an act of Con-
gress and anyone classifiedl - A
would have ample time to volunteer
tor service if that happens. The
orgarii/ations have counseled.

Public opinion polls have been
hovering around 67% against a
general amnesty and congressional
action seems to reﬂect this mood.
Leading Senate liberals such as
