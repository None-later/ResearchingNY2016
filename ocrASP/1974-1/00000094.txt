Red Eagle,
Cold, dead, noble, Red Eagle.
Tomorrow they will bury you in Black Hill.
They think you have left me forever.
When I grow lonely for you
I will walk into the night
and listen to your brother. the wind.
He will tell me if you want me.
I will follow the path through the forest
upon which your moccasins
.  i have trod so many times.
'  I will hear the night sounds you
 .  have told me about.
 I will walk into the valley of Minnelosa,
‘ the sweet grass.
In the white moonlight I will pray.
I will pray to the spirits
and they will spark to me
as they have spoken to you before.
Then I will touch your tree and you
will softly whisper to me.
From the wind. from the night.fromthe tree,
from the sweet grass.
You will whisper to me,
Red Eagle. Red Eagle.
Upon the mountain.

looking back to the Experience of the Old
Ones. for Their Guidance.

An independent study course has been
organized at this university with the intent on
raising the level of consciousness .with regard,
to Native Americans. This will take Many‘
Forms. anywhere from films and discussions,
to this column.

A greater understanding of the Native
Americans can prove beneﬁcial to us all. The
rape. poisoning. and attempted domination of
our environment, coupled with the increasing
disenchantment with various existing in-
stitutions. indicates an alternative must be
sought.

Modern urban society are a people
devoured by technological progress. with no
conception of what the Natural Universe is
like. Artiﬁcial criteria of comfort define
everything that urban areas need and hope for
in the future. The total result ofthis unusual
social order is the absolute disregard for the
Natural World.

The White Man thinks the environment to
be an entity other than himself. to be
irreplltccably exploited and mercilessly
plundered. There is a limit which man cannot
surpass in reorganiling the land to suit his 0Wll
needs. He fails to realize that Nature demands
man to listen and respond to Her; that in-
evitably She is the Master who must and will
have the last word.

The Indian lives with his land. The Earth
sustains life. and without all other forms of
hit. man cannot exist. A revr: rence isdisplayed
for the everyday environment; an environ-
ment integrally interwoven with one‘s daily
existence. No virtue is seen in imposing hiswill
over his surroundings. The Great Spirit is their
Father. the Earth their Mother. He shares
with them the secrets of the universe: she
nourishes them. The Indian understands Her
Moods and Rhythms. The meaning of Life is
idcnlilicd through His relationship with his
fellow Men and their homelands.

#—

Man must live with the other forms of Life
on the Iandyand not destroy it. He must live in
HARMONY. There is Great Strength in this
idea. Humanistic interests must reign over
economic ones.

By raising ourconsciousness through the in-
creased understanding of the Culture of the
Native American. willan alternative be realiz-
ed and made available. Understanding and
communication with the attitude of Tnlly
beneﬁting and Icarnipg, rather than some im-
personal. condescending, totally empirical

" analysis, would be an ovordue change. The

richness of the Native American Way ot'Lifeis
without bounds and can compare with any.
There remains so much to Learn.

An initial step should be taken in the
cultivation of a Native American Studies
Program here at this university. Such a
curriculum could reach into every facet of our

academic spectrum.We are hoping to take that
step. This ol'coursc, will take time, understun~
ding. and a willingness on everyone‘s part to
reach that common goal.

It is important to teach the educators intrin—
sic Indian values to avoid the misunderstan-
dings arid slercotypings that have hindered
communication between our two Peoples.
llcad way can't he gained by simply transferr-
ing interpretations and symbols characteristic
in \vhileculturrllhistory intoan Indian setting,
I he Indian People must understand their own
uniqueness. and the significance of historical
events must he considered in terms of its im-
portance to Native Americans as a group.

It is my hope that by relating and making
available various Indian concepts. coupled
with the exposure of some poetry. literature.
as well as relating pertinent news events. that a
genuine levcl ol understanding can he al-
lordcd to both students and Iacullyulikc.with
the creating a more
worthohilc. responsch atmosphere in the
future. lor both our l’coplcs.
