Someone could have made
-himseit“a little money after the
Jonathan Edwards concert Friday
night. it' this someone had the
foresight to Set up a stand outside
the ballroom and sell linament for
aching palms. he would have
returned home a wealthy man. For
inside the packed ballroom a tall
and lanky. pale-faced musician was
leading everyone in a hand-
clapping. foot-stomping evening of
rock and roll.

Johathan Edwards. the conduc-
tor of this good-time excursion,
performed the best songs off his
three albums. as well as several un-
recorded songs. And with the
twenty-one songs he chose. he
couldn‘t have pleased the crowd
more.

Using a crisp voice. Edwards
sings like a contented hillbilly
whose broad smile is as natural as
sweet-smelling country air. His
rhythm guitar work is something to
give his hands to do while he sings.
But his specialty is harmonica (he
has several different ones that he
carries in a utility belt).

Foot-stamping Rock & Roll

Opening his set with “Athens
County." Edwards established the
sound that would predominate the
show—~upheat rock. with acountry
and .hluegrass edge coming from
Bill Keith on banjo(he also played
steel pedal guitar on many 'of the
other songs) and Stu Schulman on
fiddle. Keith takes to the banjo
with the poise ofa grand old grand
dad of the instrument and seemed
just as comfortable and 'content sit-
ting at the steel pedal. Schulman
was in best fiddlin‘ formérigid as a
statue except for his busy ﬁngers
and an energetic bow rrrm. All
night long Scliulnran‘s solos almost
inevitably drew applause.

“The Ballad of" Sweet Upsy—
l)aisy" ~a bluegrass "upsy" was
the best received song of Edward‘s
set until he wrrsjoined by Orphan
who set the songs moving with a
rock groundwork. And it was with
Orphan that “Don’t Cry Blue“ and

At 7:l5 & 91l5

Jesse Colin Young‘s “Sugar Babe"
knocked the audience off its seats.
Both songs featured amazingly
wild virtuoso harmonica from
Edwards. who must have blown
the innards out of the instrument
on "Sugar Babe." Eric Lilljequist
of Orphan (on electric accoustic
guitar) and Stu Schulman turned
out some of the most exciting solos
along with that of Edwards on the
same song. And after “Don't Cry
Blue” the audience applause con-
vinced Edwards and his musicians
to do a mini-encore of the song.
The night had an occasional
softer side best exemplified by the
slow country style of "tonight i
Started Loving You Again."

For his second encore. Edwards
couldn‘t have topped the dynamic
heights reached on “Train of
Glory“ and so he wisely decided to
perform “Paper Doll." a soft.
torigue-in-chcek song with only
him and Schulman on vocals—-
Scliulman doing mock flat liar-
