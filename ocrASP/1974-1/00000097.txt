Danes inECAC’s; Top Ithaca

by Doug Lewindn _

The AlbanyStatc basketball team
will get achance 'to avenge two
“previous losses this weekend as the
Danes received their second cen-
secutive Upstate ECAC tourney bid.

On Friday night Albany will travel
to host Union College to play
Brockport State in a 7 PM start.
Over the Christmas vacation. the
Danes lost a narrow four point deci-
sion to the Golden Eagles in a crucial
SUNY conference game. Brockport
will come into the game smarting
after blowing a NCAA bid.

If the Danes can get by Brockpon.
they will probably face Union Satur-
day night. Union's opponent in Fri-
day night‘s game is (knew. a team
that beat Albany by 32l The
Dutchmen. who are currently rank-
ed first in New York State.dcfeated
the Danes in last years ECAC finals.
No advance tickets will be sold. The
doors at Union will open at six.

the Danes kept their tourney
hopes alive as they closed out their
regular season Saturday night in
their typical road game style fashion
with a hair-raising 74—73 win over
Ithaca College.

The game had an unusual begin-
ning for the now |6-7 Danes because
Albany. which is noted for its slow
first-half play whenever they are not
in the friendly confines of University
Gym. scored the first six points of
the contest on superior all-around
play. Whetherit was the fact that the
Great Danes were looking ahead'ifor
a post-season tournament bid and
wanted to make sure to earn one. or
the fact thail lthaca had a season
record of'7-l7. Albany State looked
their best during the first ten
minutes. All five starters drove to
the basket quite frequently, grabbed
a large number of offensive
rebounds. and just out—hustled
Ithaca on all parts of the floor. With
the Bombers sfcoring their first
basket after 3:|0 had elapsed. State
managed to maintain that 0 point

buldge through most ofthe ﬁrst half.

Byron Miller. one of four seniors
playing in his last regularly
scheduled game was responsible for
the bulk ofthe Albany scoring. as he
moved inside once again. hitting
consistently on iihorter range shots.
Probably because of his great

broke their scoring record. scoring a hundred points for the first time ever. Pictured
above is Mel Brown, who hpd the honor ofscoring the bucket

success against New Paltz. and the
fact that his longer bombsjust were
not connecting. Byron converted on
7 or [3 for fit points in the first half
alone.

Yet the Danes could not pull
away. As it has been the style of all
of Coach Sauers basketball teams fa
well-balancedlscoring attack). when
one player does most of the tallying-
one must be wary of the opposition.
as they‘re probably not too far be-
find. Thisisexactly what happened.
The Albany zone defense had
broken down, and the switch to
man—to-man defense didn‘t seem to
work either.ftliaca finally woke up
with only five minutes left iii the half.
and began to connect consistently on
close-in shots from l5 feet or less.

One of their favorite'plays was the

fouled beforehand. And when the
Danes would be looking for this.
guard llill Frrfkins would liit from
long range (be scored l4 in the firstl
half).

ltliaca was able to take the lead for
the first time with only four minutes
remaining. From this pointuntil late
in tlic second half'.thc squads played
even basketball. The lead changed
hands not less than five times during
the waning momentsof'the first half.
The half ended on 21 Byron Miller
specialty from the foul line. as the
lane was cleared out for him with :03
showing on the clock. This bucket
cut the iiombcricad to two points at
38—36. Nobody else scored much for
Albany State; Reggie Striith and
Mike Suprunowicl. could only
riiuster two points eadh. lid Johnson
