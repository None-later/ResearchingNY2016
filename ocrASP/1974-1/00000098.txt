Proiiosal Would House Elderly
In State College Dormitories

Assembly Speaker Perry Duryea
(R-Montauk) has proposed legislat-
tion that would allow elderly citizens
throughout the state to return to
college not to attend classes. but to
live.

The uncommon sight of elderly
men and women strolling across the
grounds of State University cam-
puses arm-in-arm with younger
students might become an everyday
occurence if the legislation is ap-
proved and signed into law by
Governor, Malcolm Wilson. The bill
would allow unused college dor—
mitory space to be made available
for senior citizens from local com-
munities who are currently housed in
projects or homes they cannot af-
ford.

“We may have available spacethat
can be utilized to house the elderly-
and at the same time provide our
Senior Citizens with much needed
educational. social and cultural op-
portunities". Duryea explained in
outlining his rationale for the bill.
“Existing services at state. city. and
private universities could provide
clinical and nursing beneﬁts. poten-
tial access to academic classes and
possible use of nutritional and
transportation services."

Under the legislation. a govern-
ment agency or nonproﬁt corpora-

tion would administerthe dormitory
and the local college would maintain
the building and provide other
agreed upon services. Arrangements
would be negotiated through the
State Dormitory Authority and the
collected rents would be used to pay
off construction bonds.

“I regard this concept as a prece-
dent for more efficient use of state
facilities...it is to the state's interest
to ensure that these buildings are ef-
ficiently and fully utilized...".
Duryea continued.

A pilot project housing elderly
citizens in unused campus dor-
mitories has existed for almost two
years at the State University at Buf-
fan and the program appears to be
working well. When the nearby Erie
County Home and Infirmary was
renovated. some 300 senior citizens
were moved into a vacant dormitory
on the campus under a three year
lease State University Chancellor
Ernest L. Boyer is known to be a
strong supporter of the concept
because in his view it encourages
diversity on the campuses and allows
wasted space to be better utilized.

Dormitories Not Nursing Homes

Assemblyman George Farrell (R—
Floral Park). whose Committee for

the Problems of the Elderly un-
covered the fact that present state
law forbids unused college dor-
mitory space to be used for noti-
student purposes said no specific
campuses have been targeted for
:lderly housing and the actual
amount of space available for hous-
ing is as yet unknown.

Both Farrell and Duryea
emphasized that the proposed
legislation will offer no tart or social
burden to localities. since the Dor-
mitory Authority will require spon-
soring agencies to be “sound. can-
tintiing and fiscally independent
agencies or organizations.”

“The dormitories are not
equipped to qualify as nursing
homes“. Duryea added. Nor doesthc
Farrell committee intend they be
used in this way."

Streaking!

Rumor has it that a streak “I” be
taking place sometime next week
down on the Alumni campus
probably next Wednesday in Alden

reports of a streak held Wednesday
night on Indian Quad. Supposedly
the streakcrs were c0~ed. No info on

Loraine Costisick of Psi Gamma
points out that due to the nation's in—
creasing population and expanding
hospital facilities the need for blood
is climbing. and is now greater than
ever. Although the demand for
blood never slackens. there is a
decrease in blood collection during
the winter months. she says. As a
result an increased effort to "Hike
donations at this time fo the year is
riec try in order to meet the need.

The sorority‘s members are
Iiopclul that a large number of
students will make a personal com—
mitment to share their good health
with someone less fortunate than
they. l'hcrc is a strong personal
