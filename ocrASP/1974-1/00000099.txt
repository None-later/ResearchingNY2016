BALLROOM

Leon Van Dyke Battles Lecal J ob'.Discrimination

by Richard Nordwind

Leon Van Dyke had moved to
Albany from Philadelphia and he
needed a job. The year was I965.
Since he had experience as a
construction-laborer. he went to the
Laborer’s Union in Albany (Local
I90) for work, but he was informed
that no job was available.

For two months straight Van
Dyke went down to Union head-
quarters. only to be told each day by
the trnion boss. “No work today."
Soon Van Dyke realized that as a
black man he stood little chance of
getting work with a wltite Laborer‘s
Union. tiriless Ire took matters into
his owrr hands.

So Van Dyke came home trite day
alter being rejected lor' work once
more. and lashioned .i picket sign
lrorit homemade materials.
protesting the Union‘s dis-
crrnrrrratory' hiring practices. lhe
rie\t day Van Dyke marched with
the sign lll Iront ol the Union ollrces
lll downtown Albany. by Itinisclk a
one mart picket line. IIre lonely yigil
struck rcsponsrycclrords throughout
the city. Area new spapers picked tip
the story. arid gradually the one mart
protest turned irtto a wide scale
demonstration against linion dis-
crimination. l'ycntttally the Union
was integrated and I.eon Van l)y ke
went to work as a laborer.

.\ot Looking for (onstruetion

('nreer

“l rte\cr did see rirysell as a lite—
long construction worker.“ I.eon
Van Dyke says now. recalling his

early protest. but deeply angered

over unfair Union practices. Van

Dyke vowed to stay with construc-
tion work until these practices were

eliminated. As opponents of Leon ~

Van Dyke have learned over the past
9 years. he does not quit easily.
Instead ol~ launching a career as a

Laborer. Van Dyke's protest started ’

hint on the path of social activismon
behalf ol~ black people. an activism
that persists today. For nine years he

has picked at Albany‘s social eon- .

sciertce with the persistence ol‘a mos-

qtiito at a summer picnic. Now L '
enrolled in a Masters Program at _

SUNY at Albany in Education for
the Disadvantaged Adult. Van Dyke
still searches l'or' new ways to elevate
the economic and social status of
blacks.

He does not look the part ot’an ac-
titist. Short. stocky. bald-headed.
with art impish lace. artd engaging
laugh. Van Dyke has a boyish
charm. bcly'ing his 39 years. Inter-
\rewed belrrre a journalism class at
SUNYA on Iuesday l‘eb. 26. by
writer William Kennedy. Van l)y k’e
was tliotrglrtltrl in all ltrsansw‘crs. y'et

irony iil srttratiorts he has been in-
\olycd in since coming to Albany.

twin to 1970 the Brothers were or
\olted in lr'equent protests o\cr'
wltat they considered racism in
Albany. iriyolting both public and
prryatcdiscrimination. Ilousingand
robs lor' blacks were the basic goals
ol the Brothers.

IIre Brother's yoerlcioris protests.
tineortrpr‘oriiisrng positions. and oc-
casionally \ioleitt rhetoric. won
them the reputation as "militants" iii
the local media. Militaney had
lrrglrtening connotations lor rrrrtriy
Americans in these years ol black
inner-city rioting. so the media label
helped push the Brothers into the
center ol Albany's attention. llatcd
or oned. the Brothers were at least
known.

leori Van Dyke belrctes that the
layish rriedra coyer‘age oi the “nrrlr-
trrrrt Albany Ilr‘otlter’s" aided the
rnoycrnent.attlrc sirmctrnrc It helped
to destroy ll. ('ertarnly the media

University Remains Rasclst

.Only one black student was
enrolled in the graduating class at
Alban)‘ State University in I965.
'l ltr'outtltlhe aid ot'the Equal Oppor-
tunity Program (E.O.I’.). ad-
ntissiotlsand enrollment procedures
have been markedly liberalized. but
l-CU“ Van Dyke arguesthat racism is
"'ch and Wcll at the University.

Van Dyke knows that this racism
will not end without a light. "When
the 12.0. I’. program ﬁrst developed.
it only came out ol’ a power struggle
Wllll the school. It was not a matter
ol school ofﬁcials looking arotrnd
rod saying "Gee. wouldn‘t it be nice
and time a program tor under-
priyrlcged kids?" lhe program came
about because we lought lot it."

\o\\ Van Dyke is a graduate stu-
dcnt at this school. Van Dyke has
undertaken .in independent .sttidy ol
