Upstate TranSit Need Cited 33?.:.?;.‘i:":.:‘:?‘“"""“°'

‘State Transportation Com-
missioner Raymond T. Schuler this
week admonished a US Senate
Subcommittee on Transportation
not to overlook transit subsidy needs
of New York's Upstate cities.

Emphasizing that he fully en-
dorsed the position that the
Metropolitan New York Region
receive adequate transit operating
support. he said,“it is importantthat
I stress the need for similar help for
our Upstate cities. which have an
equal concerii in this area.

“I would ask that as you
deliberate. you remember that in ad-
dition to a New York City. we also
have a Buffalo. at Rochester. a
Syracuse. a Binghamton. an Albany.
and a Uticaand many smaller corn-
munities. all with great unmet transit
needs." he said.

lestitying before the Subcom-
ritittec at a hearing in New York
('ity. Commissioner Schiller was
critical oI separate lcderal funding
categories which make lorari inflexi-
hlc program. and the formula which
sexerely limits the federal and one
State may receive lor‘ transit capital
improvements,

Although it has Jll per cent ol the
nation‘s passengers. New York State
would be limited to II ‘l per cent of
;i\aiI:iblc urban transportation

funds’ under an Administmtion- ‘

proposed Uniﬁed Transportation
Assistance Act. he said. The current
limit is l2.5 per cent. plus whatcvcra
State may obtain from a dis-
cretionary fund.

“The iivailabe amount falls far
short of meeting even our basic
needs; the Staten Island ferries. the
Buffalo and Rochester transit
systems go unfunded." he said.
Because of funding constraints.
there is something over $3.5 billion
in New York project submissions
which the federal Urban Mass
transportation Administration has
not acted upon. he added.

I'lie Commissioner restated the
need lor it "single. unified. ﬂexible
transportation fund to assure eon-
riiiuity ol programs which afford the
maximum opportunities for innova-
tioii and ﬂexibility"

I'ointingout that no metropolitan
area. “or the most modest village, is a
thing apart lroni the rest of the
State." he said the “State must con-
tinue its role in coordinatinganddis-
tiiliiitinglundstirnongitsregions"to
insure that programs and priorities
are balanced across the State

Commissioner Schuler also
reported on increased use of public
transportation in the energy crisis.
From October to January. when
commercial aviation ﬂights dropped
28 per cent. load factors increased
from the 40-50 percent range to 60-
85 per cent.

“Other intercity travelers have
rediscovered the train." he said.
A MTRAK Empire Service had been
serving about 425.000 passengers a
year. December I973 natronagc was

up 63 per cent over the prior
December; the year's ridership had
increased by 38 per cent over I972.
During January. ridership on one
of the major intercity bus carriers in
New York State was up l5 per cent;
other carriers reported ﬁve per cent

making every effort to bolster the
public transportation systems we
have." the Commissioner said.

The rental ceilings do not apply to
public housing.

The new shelter policy replaces
widely divergent local rental
procedures currently in effect. At
present local departments set stan-
dards of maximum rental payments
and file these schedules wttli the
State, but did make exceptions up-
ward front these standards. In addi-
