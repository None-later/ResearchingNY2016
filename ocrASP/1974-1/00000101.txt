Hudson Valley may stop. The state‘s
huge agricultural industry might be

Scores of public officials. business
leaders and private citizens have
been streaming in to Albany this
“eel. to protest the federal
government‘s plan to eliminate one—
third of the railroad trackage in New
\ork State as it consolidates the
freight s} stems of bankrupt
railroads in l7 Nonheastcrn and
Midwestern states.

Almost all of the witnesch
appearing at interstate Commerce
Commission lCC hearings on the
plan hate made such forecasts of
economic doom for their com-
munities or business or for the state

Lauyer Torrance Brooks of Cat-
taraugus. a tillage of 1.050 in
southwestern \eu York. testified
“ednesday that the abandonment
oi the Penn Central branch line
through Cattaraugus. as proposed in

v the federal blueprint. would force

the paper»products firm of Cham-
pion lnternational Corp. to mme its
plant elseu here.

“It the \illage was to km: this ser-

 iice. it will mean the loss of Jobs for
E about KS per cent of the people in the
' entire area." Brooks said. The plant

A large number of the firms are
concentrated on the so-callcd “Ho-

Lake Ontario from Oswcgo to
Niagara Falls. This route has been
designated ‘potcntiully cxccss“ by
the federal Transportation Depart-
ment.

The new. federally financed Con-
solidath Railway Corp. authorized
by Congress in January, will com-
bine the operations of the Penn Cen—
trul and six other bankrupt carriers.

l'hc 'l‘runsportution Department
has identified about one quarter of
the region‘s track milcagc as“potcn—
tially excess" and has recommended
its abandonment as unprofitable.
