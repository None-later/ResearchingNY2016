~The task of ' reviewing erotic
cinema can be an enjoyable ex-
perience and it also may prove to be
a waste of time, money and celluloid.
The ﬁlm The Devil In Miss Jones
provides little of the former and
quite a bit of the latter. The notorie-

say I was a little disappionted.
Some fans of pornographic| ﬁlm
will say it's not the plot but what
they've got that is the standard by
which one evaluateslthe necessity of
these ﬁlms. I really can't agree. The
Devil In Miss Jones. starring
Georginal Spelvin. is about a virgin
who decides to take her own life. But
the trick is that she is given the
chance to partake in all the 'little dir-
ty'- things she missed out onin life.
Since she has been condemned
anyway. for committing suicide. she
decides to indulge in sex and wants
her time to be spent consuan and
possessed by lust before she makes
her trip to the inferno. Breaking her

Nuclear Plants Raising New Questions

This is a three part series on the

efforts to regulate their use. Part I

and scientists toward a nuclear

and business toward the plants and

plants have encourrtcrcd to date.

Always = on Sunday ' F --

ALBANY. (AP) - Gasoline
stations along the Thmway will be
opening on Sundays again, and the
legislature has seized upon that fact
to cancel its own special program of
Sunday gas supplies to its members.

The state Thruway Authority an-
nounced Wednesday that beginning
this weekend its gas stations will
open at noon on Sundays. ending
three months of compliance with the
national voluntary policy at. Sunday
closings.

At the same time. Gov. Malcolm
Wilson issued an executive order
reducing from l00 miles to 47 miles
the distance motorists must travel on
thc Thruway hcforc buying gas on
llrc "wrong" day under the odd-cvcn
rationing program.

A few hours later. Assembly
speaker l’crr) l)uryca and Senate
Maiority l.cadcr‘ Warren Anderson
issued a ioint slatcmcnt dcclaringthc

This program rcccn‘cd wide-
spr'cnd ncws media cmcrngc. and

several lawmakers immediately
denounced it publicly. All of the
denouncers were from the Albany
area or able to ride regular airline
ﬂights to their jobs.

Thc Thruway decision to open on
Sundays apparently came as pan of
an expanding state policy to end the
Sunday closings. rather than as a
waon let the legislatorsoffthe hook
on the Sunday supplies program.

Thruway Chairman R. Burdell
Hixby said the Sunday closings
policy “has caused hardship and in-
convenience to thousands of
travelers with legitimate reasons to
rravcl on Sunday." He said it also
had hurt the state‘s recreation in-
dustry.
