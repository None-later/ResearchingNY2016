by those morally superior beings who make
laws against what drugs we consume. which
movies we watch. on what games we may
wager and with whom we may sleep.

The rationale behind such laws is usually
that the State in all its bencficent wisdom must
protect John Q. l’ublic from himself. orclsc he
will surely drag his mind and body to the edge
of the abyss of Hell. the implication. ol‘coursc.
being that the public is too ignorant orloolish
to make its own decisions and so they must be
made for him. l'Iic rcccnt arguments in lithtl'
ol the State‘s various prohibitions also stress
the notion that not only the individual but

 

leave the theater and commit ii rttpc. Of
course. in actuality. some of the recent porno
flicks are so nauseating that there is greater
danger that the viewer may leave the theater
and join it convent. Nevertheless. there was
some thoughtthat the danger would not be
limited to tire perpetrator of the "crime." An
acid head. as another example. might think he

over somebody.
