Wrestlers Prospects Look Bright for  u a.

by Kenneth Arduino

Having to play second fiddle
to the basketball team, the
Albany wrestling team went out
and had the best record in its
history, despite a few nagging in-
juries. The " injuries piled up
near the end, which affected their
performance at the end of the
season and in tournament com-
petition.

This is not a gloomy report but
an encouraging one, as Albany
wrestling has ﬁnally come ofagc.
No longer is it just something on
the sports page. but it iszi very
sucessful team. that can hold its
own against anyone. Let‘s look
ill the record. Albany lost only

twice all year. Once was against
Cortland right after intercession.
when the Danes were admittedly
out of shape. In fact, despite
numerous injuries during the
S U N YACS, Cortland could
only tie the Danes.

The other loss came to power-
l'ul C. W. Post in a home meet.
Post is one of the State's very
best and losing to them is no dis-
grace at all.

Other than those two loses, the
Danes did a fine job, taking on
some very good teams and set-
ting them down quickly. This
year teams like Rochester, who
has beaten the Danes in the past.
could not hold their own on the
mat.

FRIDAY, Mllllllll ll, NW]

The men who did the job for
the Danes deserve much praise.
Senior co-captain Larry Mims
finished off a 39-5-I career by
posting a I3-l mark and getting
Ail-American honors for his ﬁfth
place finish in the
NCAA‘s. Larry. who has been
consistently one of the best. also
finished second in both the
SUNYAC‘s and the State Charli-
pionship. Too bad he is gone
after this year as he will be ex-
tremely hard to replace.

Probably the most popular
wrestler. at least by crowd reac-

tion. was heavcy weight Rudy
Vido.lic was the last wrestler to
lose 2i match, losing in the State
championships. He became a
two-time SUNYAC champion
and was sent to the Nationals.
Rudy's one problem during the
year was finding opponents, as
many teams conceded the match
to Rudy. When he did find an
opponent though he was
devastating.

The newcomer who added the
most to this team was transfer
Don Mion. Mion at i90pounds.
along with Rudy gave Albany a
devastating I-2 punch. Mion un-
fortunately wris hampered with
injuries at the end of thcscasori.

in only his second season.
soplimorc Wait Kut/ was looked
upon to provide that early lead
illld more times than not. lie

seem to get ihc quick points as

llickets are now on sale for State University Theatre’s production of

 

§before each performance.

Tom Horn. a |58 pounder,
also was a big key as he helped
carry the Danes early. The home
fans will probably remember him

for his action packed matches
and his last second victories.

Co—mptain Doug Bauer, was
bothered by injuries. throughout
the season. and because of them,
was inconsistent. Yet even
though he was having a hard
time, he was able to contribute to
the team by saving points for not
being pinned.lf he can stay clear
of injuries, he can help pick up
the slack next year.

Rick Lawrence and Frank
Herman I77 pounds had one of
those years as both were
hampered by injuries. yet at the
beginning of the season. one of
them was always healthy
cnlough to go out there and con~
tribute.

Newcomer Jeff Golden forced .

into the limelight.'rfue to injuries
started off slow but the rest of the
team was performing well
enough and it was not too
noticeable. Once he got his feet
wet though. he held his own
sgainst anyone and picked up his
share of points.

Ethan Grossman was a
mainstay early picking up quite a
few victories and pins. Because
of a shoulder injury and a few
bad breaks Ethan lost some of
his effectiveness. He should
rebound next year to early
season form.

Vic (iiigliardi and Brian
.Iuhrcy (l26 pounds) had the
still“: problems Golden had. in-
c\pcricnce. Yet as the season
continued. they also contributed
points. l'hcy arc the future of
this team.
