Aquamen Set for Swimming Championships

by Rob Geier

The Albany Swiml team is
engaged in the SUNYACCham-
pionships at Potsdam on Thurs-
day. Friday. and Saturday ofthis
week. Coach Brian Kelly was
optimistic about the teams per-
formance citing six swimmers
who rank in the top six in their
events.

'1 he team has been tapering lor
the last two weeks and planned
to ‘stiave down' on Wednesday
evening at Potsdam. l’racirces
lllytilycd less endurance sunn-
niing. illlti itirici-iiirriiing on
slioit spiinis lllrll deieloped tlie
swrrnnrcrs' sense ot pitting and
lot in llrc slrtry trig down process
is a ritual that is perhaps one of
the most idiosyncraticuspectsof
the sport of swrrnrriing. llie
swimmers slime all their leg,
arm. and body hair in tin ellort to
reduue friction and thereby
mllllnll/J: drag as they pull
through the water. lnsliavriig, a
layer of dead skin tissue is
removed which increases the
Mhsensrtivity to the water giv-
ing the {hump better feel for
the race. Perhaps the most im-
portant aspect of sliavrng down
is psychological llie swrrnrner
senses lie is going faster and
therefore does.

The swimmers were prepared
and the State meet will provide
the opportunity for swimmers
who have consistently won to
test their ability against other
New York State atheletes.

Coach Brian Kelly is counting on
the talents of freshman Dan
Dudley in the two hreastroke
events. Dudley Will also be corri-
peting on three relay teams, the
400 yard lrccstyle; 800 yard tree
and 40 Medley Relay

  

Se'nior Lean Van Ryn will be
competing in the 500 yard
freestyle. 1650 yard free. 400
yard Individual medley and on
two Dane relay squads. Van Ryn
has not has as good a year as in
the past. but Kelly feels his ex-
perience in championship cori-
petition will be an asset.

Junior Rick Masoin. who
shattered tour Albany swimming
WWI-(15] during regular season.

will swim the 50 and 100 yard

  

freestyle and Kelly believes he
could go to the finals,

Ken Weber will compete in lhe
500 yard 1rcestylc. and the 165i).
and should finiin among the top
12. In championshop competi-
trori double points are scored for
thc llrstl 12 places recorded.

freshman Mitch Rubin wrll
.swrm the 100 and 200 yard
butterfly Kelly pegs
Rubin as the key man lll the
medley rclays.

Jack Seidenberg is entered in

CVL’lllb.

the 100 and 200 yard
breaststroke eVents. and Kelly
says he should finish in the top
12.

Brent Siebecker has been
entered iii the 50-100—and 200
yard freestyle sprints and Will
swirnon three relay learns.

Albany has the highest seed in
the KUU yard relay, fourth of
twel\e teams. and will compete
[tom the erghtli seed in the 400
yard Medley and the 400 yard
freestyle.
