Overseas Bases

(ZNS) The United States has been
moving recently to increase its
“Military Presence“ around the
world.

In just the past week. the Pen—
tagon has been putting the ﬁnishing
touches on two agreements- each one
setting up anew US. Military Base
tilt the otltcr side of the globe.

()ne of the new locations is in
Greece: and the other is on the small
island of Diego Garcia iii the middle
ol’ the Indian Ocean.

In (ireccc. American military ol-
licials‘ and members of the new
(ireek junta have been holding talks
on what is known as “Homeporting”
part ol' the U.S. Sixth Fleet in
Athens. Under the proposed
Iionieportirig agreement. the United
States vvould assign six destroyers.
an aircralt carrierand a hospital ship
to work permanently out of Elclsis
Iiay. about I5 miles southwest of
Athens.

lilclsis Bay would literally act as

' “ Home Port". requir—

 

tlie task lorce s

irtg the assignment at ISOO Navy
dependents iii the Athens area.

In a separate'agreement involving
the Indian Ocean. the United States
announced last week that the British
government has permitted the US.
Seventh Fleet to expand American
Military installations on the British-
owned istiiiid ol Diego Garcia. This

tiny island is located l200 miles ol‘l~

the southern tip of India. and is
strategically located near the Persian
(iull‘ and at one end of the Sith
L'anal.

I'Iie Pentagon says it plans to
spend $29 million to build or expand
docking areas and air-landing strips
on Diego (iareia- and. possibly. to
turn Diego Garcia into a base lorser-
vicirig US. Nuclear Submarines.

I'ltc Diego (iarcia expansion
plans ol the United States have
brought some unusually harsh
criticism from the non-aligned
nations ol the area- including a
vigorous denunciation from the
usually pro-western government
oI India.

Soviets, Chinese Seen
Preparing for Conﬂict

([NS) Pacific News Service
reports that the people of China are
bertig primed by their leadership to
meet any escalating military threat
Il'tlm the Soviet Union.

Izsrled Soviet vvriter Alexander
Sol/liciiitsyri recently revealed the
nightmarish prospect. wrdely
accepted in the Soviet Union. that a
Chinese-Russian atomic war will
break out- costing b0 million Soviet
lives and riiany times that number of
the Chinese side.

Both sides have been preparing tor
a iiiilitaryshovvdovi'n with each other
since the Sino-Sovtct riIt lirst open-
ed in I959. At the present time. orie-
t|irrd oI all the Soviet lorccs are
positioned along the 4500»milc
Soviet Mongolia-Chinese border.

llie Supreme Soviet recently
votcda new campaign medal Ior scrv
vice on the Chinese tronticr. an act
which indicates the expectation ol
nevi riiilitary troubles. Some War-
savv I’act members. spcctlically
I’olrsh paratroopers. are reported
lor the Iirst time to he on maneuvers
in Soviet Asia.

In addition. the numbcr ot Soviet
divisions in Mongolia have been

Irorii I’ckrng.

Chinese Premier Chou En-l.ai has
repeatedly told Iorcigncrs that more
than one million Soviet troops
threaten China. And the Chinese
have built the most extensive tall-out
shelter system in the world. an ob-
vious signal that they expect to be
victims ol a nuclear attack.

l'acilic News correspondent
l‘riltl/ Schurniann reports there is
no hysteria in China about! the
prospects ol war. but that eon~
sidcriible apprehension appears to
c\rst in Russia.
