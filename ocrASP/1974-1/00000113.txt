dege
by Henry Jacobson

On any hand. declarer‘s
prime task is to make his bid.
On occasion. he will generally
forfeit an overtrick or two to
ensure the success of his conv
tract. Such a play is named a
“safety play." and is similar to
an insurance policy.

in each set or hands yours
and duininy‘s hand are shown.
What is the best way to play
the cards ifyou can only afford
the loss of:

a( 3) tricks: A9xx KQli)xx

May the King. if either op-
ponent shows out. finesse ac-
cordingly. The play of the Ace
first loses when the .lxxx is
before the Ace.

b )0 tricks: Axxx KQEJxx

Here. if you play the King
and the player over the King;
disci'ads. his partner Will
eventually Win a trick.
However. if the Ace is played
first. four tricks can still be
brought in by repeated Iinesso
of the Nine.

11' the player after the Arc
started out With no cards in
this suit. one trick has to be
losl in any event.

Contract: 6 clubs

Since this rubber bridge.
your only concern is to ensure
that 2 tricks in trumps are not
lost. if the outstanding clubs
are 2-2 or 3-1. you will always
make the contract. Therefore
you only have to worry when
either opponent shows up
With Q.le in clubs. 11' you lay
down the club Ace. hoping to
later finesse if Eastsliows out.
you meet with disaster if West
has ii void. The same facx
applies if you lay down the
Kling first and East has none.

The only safe way (100"?) is
to play a small trump from
say. your Iiand and insert the
10 11' West follows. if he does
have all four trumps. then he
is only gleaming 1 trick from
that holding.

If however. Westdiscards on
your lead ol a low trump. go
With the King. 'l‘hcn lead a
small trump ol'l dummy inten-
ding to finesse 11 East plays
small.
