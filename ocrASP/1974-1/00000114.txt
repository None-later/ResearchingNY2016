 

Revivai Meeting. ' V
or Concert?

by Maureen D. Griess

The Indoctrinationthat never was.

This would have been a more con-
cise billing for the'Seals and Crafts
concert at the RPI Fieldhouse
Tabernacle last Sunday evening.

Their message is religion and'their
religion is Baha’i. But obvious
audience signs such' as a consistent
undercurrent of chatter and
premature applause were clear in-
dications that the words were simply
incidentals to the music.

They claimed that they had not
come to proselytize anyone, then. ac-
ting out the part of ministers, they
proceeded to sing their praises to the
congregational lloclc.

The concept of Baha‘i. or an inter-
I'aith world religion, inspires their
lyrics arid style. Many oltheir songs,
such as "’l‘heEuphratesl‘and. “Hum-
mingbird.“ contain direct quotes
lromthe Baha‘i Scriptures. The new
hit song. “Unborn Child“ from their
latest album is based on one of the
Baha‘i beliefs. As Jim Seals points
out. “In the Baha'i faith, it is ex-
plained that the soul is an individual
at the moment ot'conccption.All we
are saying is for people to think
about it. nothing more." And so
they sang:

Oh tiny bad that growsin the womb
()nly to be crushed before you can
bloom

Momma stop, tum Mounds go back.
think it over.

Ilalia'i is a religionwound around the
prophet llaha‘u‘llah who was born in

AT $1

lrzin about l840. At age 27. he was
jailed for 40 years for histeuchings.
He urged all humanity to join
together in unity of races. classes,
colors. and religions. He tried to
promote world peace and make the
brotherhood of man a reality.
Baha‘u‘llah claimed that all religions
come from the same source; God.
Problems arise quickly when the
differing religions try toagrce which
sacred writings should be predomi-
nant. The ideal is a good one but am
it work?

The music ol‘Seals and Crofts is a
world language in itsell‘that anyone
can understand. They are it unique
l'olk duo and their two voicesblendel-
l'ortlessly. On stage and in private
they are accessible and want to talk
to you. buyour friend. This is the
advertised tender trap for the
product which is evangelism.

Why had this event been an early
sell—out? When asked. Why did you
come here tonight. some replied,

“I have an album of theirs," or

“I have it Jim Seals cap." ‘

Both Jim and Dash arc lotions
and their accents invite you to sit
down and relax. Dash says he likes
simplicity while exhibiting high plate
l'orm white patton leather shoes. ii
bright kelly green suit with side
pleats in the slacks lrom the call to
ankle. a purple shirt. l'our turquoise
rings. l'our turquoise bracelets and it
decorated stair studded lapel.

Jim and Dash reject progress and
urge others not to he overtaken by it.
Yet according to a stage hand. their
$59,000 retitcd sound equipment is
nearly as good as the quadrapltonie

twelve piece hartd complete with
drums. horns. organ and sax-
ophones. But as Dash explains.
"We have to be somewhat concerned
about money sinccall the people that
work I’or you depend on your
success."

The entire show was a myriad of
religious symbolism. During the
sting. “Diamond Girl." for instance,
a center object from the ceiling il-
luminated lights that poured over
the audience as they continuously
niclamorphosircd into stars. dots.
and triangles. “But he who does
what is true comes to light." ( Johnr.

Iluli' [tilt/e). Another instance was
when an apropos match lighting
ceremony in a pitch black room was
used as a device by the audience to
make the two reappear lor an en»
core.

the murky smell ol’ marijuana was
litllll. tor this was not their scene.
The audio level in the room had risen
steadily so that at the L‘lttJ.\\’llll Dash

reiii‘al meeting. No one was sitting
and those that were standing were
either dancing in the aisles or clap-
ptiigloudly. l'lieannotiiicenient that
came at the beginning was repeated;
Dash and Jim would answer
questions concerning the Baha'i
laitli [0 minutes alter the show.

Fifteen minutes later the soldiers
ol Baha'u'llah returned to a crowd of
about 500 people. Few were con-
cerned with the religion and most of
them trom seating in the rear of the
l'ieldhouse came to get a closer look
at Seals and Crol'ts. Jim gave a short
synopsis ot their beliefs saying, "We
areinstrumentsolthelaith and as in-
strumciits. we spread the message
and teachings." Altcrwards, those
with questions were invited to meet
the pair at the llolidaylnn in'l‘ruy.

Seals and Crolts are travelling

shield to spread the words ol
