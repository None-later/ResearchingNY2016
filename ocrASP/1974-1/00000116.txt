Your intrepid ASP reporter was recently
able to garner an exclusive interview with
that greatly admired and much sought-after
consumer advocate RolfNider. Mr. Nider had
just delivered a stirring speech about the
dangers of ﬂuoride toothpaste on the
reproductive systems of the wombat popula—
tion to an enthusiastic group of ladies fron‘
the Concerned Citixens to Ban Just About
Everything. After discussing the need for FAA
regulation of hummingbird flying patterns.
Mr. Nider and I left the hall and ldrovc us
both to the airport. from which we would ﬂy
to the Capitol and be driven to his home to
complete this thorough and profound inter-
view of the man who has so effectively shown
us the dangers awaiting the hapless consumer
at the hands of the big business predators.

Mr. Nider was at first reluctant to enterthe
car because it was an older model without the
netv 5 mph safety bumpers and door-guard
beams. but lconvinced him that il'he strapped
himself in tight on tlte rear seat and kneclcd
iortvard with his head between his knees. he
would be reasonably safe as long as | drtrve
less than IO mph. Though Mr. Nider never
learned to drive. his knowledge of
automobiles based on his pioneering study of
defects in the Cortiiir rapidly becartie obt ious.
as he asked me what engine l had,

“Oh. it‘s just a 350 witlt a 2-barrcl and lotv
compression engine." I volunteered.

"Yes." Mr. Nider replied, “but does it run on
steam or batteries?" And some people say Mr.
Nider has no sense of humor!

“it runs on low-lead gas." I proudly iri-
lorined llllii. He then muttered something
about not seeing any labelson the carthat said
it was gas powered and this was deceptite
adtertising and the Department oi transpor-
tation would soon hear about llll\.

Alter tte had Iiiially strapped oiirscltcs
careitilly onto our seats to the airplane and we
had taken oil and Mr. :Nidci . cai'eliil man that
he is. ltad tcmot ed the pillow irorii lt|\ month.

I toluiite’crcd that that seemed a logical
place to pttt bathtubs. but my attempt at
htiirioi wcot unnoticed. and he continued.
‘My .Nidcr's Riders hate bccii iritcstrgating
this pr. olcin tirt months now and Wt: hate

come upon some horrendous evidence on the
hazards involved each time a citizen ventures
into these death traps.

“Our scientiﬁc instruments have shown a
tendency for bathtubsi to overturn during hard
cornering maneuvers with occasional dis—
astrous consequences forthe occupantsinside.
especially if more than three are using the tub
simultaneously. What's more. nonc ofthe tub
builders have made collapsible faucets or
padded knobs. and they all have steadfastly
refused to install safety belts. roll bars. air
bags or even head-rests to prevent whiplash
injuries. And if you have ever come to a
screechirtg hall from 20 mph in a bathtub.you
know what I mean!"

“What can the hapless consumer do about
this outrage?" I asked.

“We must boycott bathtubs by refusing to
take batlrs and we must pass legislation to
protect the unwashed consumer from failing
prey to the selfish motives ol the bathtub eon-
glomeratc, l advocate." continued Mr. Nider.
‘ ssage oi the National Bathtub and Shower
Salety Act and the creation of a federal
Bureau ol Bathing which will enforce the new
safety standards. Furthermore. I will take
court action to take big business out of
bailitiibs and pirt the lederal government in."

While Mr. Nidei's words were sinking in. I
noticed he had taken the bag ol salted peanuts
the stewardess had handed him and carclully
placed it iii his pocket. linck at his lioiitc iii
Georgetown. i asked him why be bothered to
save nuts.

“I hate loiriid to my shock and arna/c-

Dear Student:

As you are aware. it new phenomenon of the
seventies has recently swept across college
campuses throughout the nation. This
phenomenon; known as streaking, has been
receiving a good deal of publicity in the
various news media. with new streaking
records being reported almost nightly on the
television.

Various eminent psychologists have been
consultcdrcgardingthis newfad. and have been
asked what they believe to be the cause and
rationale behind the streaking epidemic.
Rebellion against society. the blatant viola
tion of society‘s sexual morcsarid the like have
been cited. but the general reply is that
streakingisgrowing on campuses because it is
ltllt. ‘

We at Student Health Services believe that
streaking is indeed dangerous to sttideiits and
would like to explain to the student body
several of the perils we have uncovered. so that
every student may evaluate the lactsartd deter<
initic il be or she wants to streak.

liitegral to our negative position on streak-
ing are the weather conditions found at the
State Univc 'ty oi New York at Albany.
lciiipcratures usually are in the 30's
tlirotigliotit the month of March. and oc-
casionally drop well below the free/ing mark.
/\s eter'yone is aware. when it is cold out. one
lirsl iccls it in his or her extremities. usually
onc‘s lingers iirid tocs. A streaking student
however finds that he or she now has a tew
more extremities to be concerned with . Per-
mit us to expound. Picture at young Albany
coed. dressed only in boots. and scail and hat.

election which took place the day before
yesterday could spell disaster for any country.
It has not yet ceased to amaze me that almost
everyone that We spoken to has thought the
election to be unnecessary. That is to say. the
general feeling is that regardless of who comes
out ahead. the same steps would have to be
taken in dealing with the cconomic'problcms

Furthermore. and perhaps more important-
ly. none of the parties seemed to be saying
much of anything at all. not even by way of
making pledges. They were doing little else
than engaging in a sophisticated round of
nitrite-calling. In other words. there were no
clearly drawn differences between parties and
what their courses of action would be. andthe

These. results are extraordinarily mis-
leading. and it is this factor which disturbs me
as well as many of the people here. There
seems to be absolutely no proportion in the
system. Labor. ith its 30| seats. received
37.2% of the vote. the Conservatives 38. l% of
the vote. and the Liverals l9.3%ofthe vote. In
other words. the Laborand Conservative Par-
ties cach acquired approximately 300 seats.
each with It) million votes. and the Liberals.
for its meager l4 seats. had received 5 million
votes. Also. Labor wound up with more seats
than the Conservatives on less votes. This
kind ol'disproportionate representation seems
to itidicate a need for some sort ol'overhaul of
the British electoral system. Like anything
else. as Americans only know too well. it
becomes a matter of priorities. and in Britain
right now. people already talking about
holding another election. With the British
got crnmcnt resting on so uneasy a mandate it
is no wonder that the people grow more criti-
