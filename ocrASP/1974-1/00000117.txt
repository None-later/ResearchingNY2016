Of our generation it is
characteristic that we sttould discuss
the question of whether there is an
IDEA of anything. for we live in an
age when Platonic universrils are
rapidly evaporating. Karl
Mannheim‘s Drag/iurr'r'ii/ Our Tilllt'.
a book significantly published ltt
I944. proposes the theory that
modern life is best trnderstood rtt
terrtts of the gradual erosion of
“authentic paradigmatic es-
pcriciices.” by which term

Have we entertained the idea of a
Weekly symposium. colloquium or

trik'e a .turn perhaps to share
something which as recently excited

possibility of inviting our selves to
write an essay not intended to a
national journal. but intended only
to be circulated among our
colleagues. art essay which might in-
votve reflections on the present state
of academic departments. or what I
attempted to do in my 499 course.or
this is an idea fora course I had last
night when I couldn‘t sleep?

I offer these suggestions not as
merely alternatives to publishing in
national journals (although we shall
have to devise alternatives quickly
with the shrinking publishing oppor-
tunities university presses and jour-
nals are affording). but to un-

problems —- and the list could be
enlarged —- that bear directly upon
our lives and demand the most im-
aginative approaches.

My interest is not in attempting to
catalogue all the problems with
which we are beset. and most cer«
tainly not to offer specific solutions
to arty. My initial point was that we
have substituted these superficial
patterns of modular thinking
"I‘i'agtttents of adjustiment to art
everehanging environment“ ~ for
the authentic paradigmatic ex»
periences of students of the
humanities and of human beings.
the adoption of these paradigm of
existence has done us a great disser-
vice: it has encroachcd upon the
resources of' our own imaginative
creativity. forcing us to think in
traditional ways. and tempting us
with despair il'we should ever dream
of changing those ways. I don‘t
