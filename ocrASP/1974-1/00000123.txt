Cooke. who spoke. had several
criticisms. which she based on ar-
ticles in the Knickerbocker News.
about what she alleged wasa glut of
ot'tice space in the arca.'and she
suggested that residential facilities
be built instead or along with ofﬁces.

The only outright opponent has
been Chester Smith. an economist
and president of an organization
called Voice of the Taxpayers. a
statewide group Smith opposed; the
project for four reasons. the first be-
ing that “taxpayers statewide will be
holding the bag on this project it' it
doesn't pay oft. and my basis for
that...is that the Court decision in
the Supreme Court Appellate Dis-
trict. 'l'hird Department. Smith ver-
sus Comptroller U.D.C.. the Court
l'ound that U.D.C. Bonds area con-
tingent liabilityl' ot' the State of New
York."

Smith also objected on the
grounds that no Liniincialt tigures
were included in the ofﬁcial plan
book tor the project. He feels the
ll.l).C. has not given an adequate
explanation of the costs ol the
mcettaiilsiri ol ﬁnancing the project.
