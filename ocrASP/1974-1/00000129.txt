001   and "the Gang Disappointing In Gym

by KM. Danlets

.I just don't know how we did it
again you all! It seems that we are the
ﬁrst gi'oup of our size that l haveever
seen that has either: forgot how to
party or to have partied ourselves
out before we even started. We are
one of the few groups of people who
would dare to "beef" at being charg-
ed a “fin” to get in and who would
turn'I right around and want to get
out again.

Examination of this Fridays Kool
and the Gang concert (with the
Manhattans) will bear certain
reasons whiz;

The evening started late. more
than ninety minutes late. and people
were becoming just a bit cdgy.lThe
stage was set with only a small p.a.
system until after the stated show
time because the sound equipment
was late arriving. The crowd grow-
ing anxious. tired. and “higher” was
partying for a part but many needed
the traditional pre-concert recor-
dings to “get of“. (If a record player

was brought along we could have
had a dance while waiting). Un.-
derstandablyJ then by the time the
mellow Manltallans,’ arrived with
hand to the stage many people had
already began to “peak out".

The Manhattans. a very establish-
ed group more unfortunately did not
live.up to the quality of their past
performances. The Manhattans can
sing. and that is a fact. but they
didn't do too much of thatfl‘hcy did
sing a few oldies and a few contem-
porary times such as their great
original version of “When we get
married". “Midnight 'l‘rain to
Georgia“. and hit “There‘s no Me
without You". But one of the five:
Manhattans just didn‘t “get over“
with his Barry White image.“ guess
you had to be there to pick up that
last one.) It was bad. (Bad =awful)
Another severe dissttpointment is
Barry‘s ((12) penchant for talking.
’I'alking isiinart iii its place. now was
rather the time for singing. Barry #2
is still getting off on the question

i

“What is a man. What isa woman?”.
I think that is rather played out,
probably reliitiiig why many of the
younger members of the audience
got off.

The Manhattans should take a
break from the circuit and get their
act together.

After a brief respite Kool and the
Gang was to come onstage. The
group refreshed after a day of relaxa-
tion (granted me an interview prior
to the start of ihcslltﬂV-SCL‘ICI’lClOSCd
exclusive) wanted very hard to
please the sea of black faces in the
gym. We waited hopefully in an-
ticipation. recalling the songs we
wanted to hear in our minds.

But remember still that as of this
time had not had a sound check and
in the gym that surely was to spell
disaster. While the Manhattans were
onstage we had a hard time hearing
them also. lltey had no sound check
and sounded lousy so how possibly
could Koo! (lllt/ l/lt‘ (iung be any

appeared playing at the start “Jungle
Boogie". a sad mistake because dur-
ing the Iirst few charts the band
rendered a piece with a barely audi-
ble horn section.

It really wasn‘t so fantastic idea to -
leave the gym floor free of chairs
because over the accumulative noise
ol'the dancers shufﬂing their feet, the
band was lost in the shufﬂe.

poed it lot slower than the recorded
version and ill comparison seemed

the gang jammed out.

Special note must be taken of the
particularly bad lighting employed
in the show for what is a very visual
act. At no times could many ofus see
what was going down onstage so
many I imagined stared into space
iesulting in a most severe handicap
to KUU/ and Ilie Gang and the un-
eventful evening that drove many
outside and away before a conclu—
sion was reached.
