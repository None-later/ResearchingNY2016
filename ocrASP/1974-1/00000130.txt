How do you convert a lieldhouse
with 6.500 occupied seats into a cozy
living room? (Hint: Not by carpeting

,the hockey rink). Answer: Have a

concert featuring Seals and Crofts
along with England Dan "and‘John
Ford Coley.

'l’he personable air of the per-
formers made the March |0th sold-
out concert at the drafty RPl
fieldhouse seem more like a
neighborly gathering to enjoy some
talented triends.,

Warming Up A Chllly House

A&M Records‘ England Dan and
John Ford Coley. an ‘acoustic-
oriented d‘uol opened the evening
with a few light and lively songs
(perfect for an audience with rl
voracious'music appetite) England
Dan strummcd a I2 strin; guitar
while Coley alternated between ban-
jo. guitar and piano.

l‘or some reason. their harmonies
sounded very similtirto that ol'Scals'
and Crol'ts‘. Alter the first song.
England Dan casually revealed
liiiiisell to be none other than the
brother of Jim Seals. He wasn't
boasting; he was just being honest.
in order to trike the edge ofl this
startling enlightenment. he added
with a -hoyrsh“ grin.“we all ride
motorcycles together."

"I'm A Rambler." "Mud 'n
Stone." and “I‘m the Pilot.“ were
spirited arid upbeat in nature. eon-
trasting with an outstanding mood
piece. "What I'm Doing." Coley‘s
soft! piano Work built steadily in
intensity all anguished outcry ol
lrustratlnrr. with England Hall‘s
guitar appropriately supportive.

rlient. stressing ly rres the imprison-

England Dan knew it. This lightning
that preceeded the on-going thunder
walked back on stage and happily
said.‘V_l/t:ll.you talked us into it.“

Strange Interlude

During intermission. a round-
bellied man whose navel peeked out
from the bottom of his short 'l'-shirt
began spraying the stage and ceiling
with a grey-white mist. Did England
Dan and John Ford Coley com-
plaiil' about some unexpected com-
pany. which neccessitated the hasty
arrival and expedient services ol'E-Z
Exterminating Company? I was
mildly distressed as the spray dis-
placed much of the cold lieldhouse
air I had grown accustomed to
breathing. Shortly. l was informed
that the mist was only a spotlight
softener made of water and oil.

aspect ol Seals‘ and Crolts‘ perfor-
