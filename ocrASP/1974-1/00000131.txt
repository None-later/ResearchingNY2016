Mitggin

“l have to be satisﬁed with the l7-8
record." said Doc Saucrs as be
reﬂected on the just-completed
basketball season. This is really an
understatement. as Sauers took
three returning ball players and
molded them with three freshmen to
come up with a very successful com-
bination.

Lel‘t with no returningguards Doe
put his faith in freshmen Ed John-
son. Gary Trcvett and Mike
Supronowitz and it paid off. Their
inexperience plagued the Danes
tltrougltottt the early going but all
three matured as the season
progressed.

I’he Cagers really turned their
sL son around after their double loss
road trip. leaving the team at 7-6.
Albany won their next seven in a row

oung Cagers Face

including the unforgettable game
agaiitst Siena.

The team. though. was hurt by in-
consistent play. as Albaity often had
hot and cold stretches. The Danes at
tintes were undisciplined and took
too ittaity poor shots. Albany was)
best at the ruttning game as the l‘resh-‘
ment guards seemed more ae-
ciistonted to it.

the key to the team‘s success has
to be attributed to Byron Miller.
liyroii led the Danes in scoring and
became Albany‘s seventh thousand
point man. Miller was the man the
team looked to in the clutch. The
l)anes seemed to rely on Miller too
much. When Byron couldn‘t spark
the club. the team olten fell ﬂat. His
inconsistent play on the road also
lturt. But when Byron was at the top
til ltis gantc there was nobody with a

 

better shooting touch. In many
gantes he brought the Danes back
into eonteiitioit with his hot
shooting. lit tlte Sicna game Miller
provided the last minute heroics as
his shot with l4 seconds won the
game. Miller will be a hard man for
.l)oc Sattcrs to replace.
Senior co-capttiin Reggie Smith
had ltiiitscll another line year 'is' he
also closed out his varsity career.
Reggie was the team's leading ol l'cn-
sive rebounderand Saucrs lelt Smith
played as close to his potential as
possible.

llarry Johnson is really a true rags
to riches story as he never played
high scltool ball. Brit iit his three
years on the varsity squad. he cer-
tainly made a substantial contribu-
lltilt. Alter ait iiyylul start shooting-
\visc at the begiiiiiiitg ol the year.
