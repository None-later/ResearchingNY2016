Assemblyman Eve Charges Racism at SUNYB

by Glenn von Nostitl

State Assemblyman Arthur Evc
thinks the State University at Buffalo
is guilty of racial discrimination. so
in about four weeks he plans to in-
stitute court proceedings against the
University Center to correct the
situation.

In a recent wide-ranging interview
in his Albany office. Eve described
his efforts to achieve fair hiring prac-
tices at S UNY Buffalo and the entire
statewide SUNY system. He is try-
ing to find out about past and pre-
sent actions at Buffalo by talking to
staff members. and is obtaining line
item budget compilations‘and other
data on the number of minority

employees hired by the university.

The Assemblyman says the SUNY
Buffalo administration has been
generally uncooperative with his in-
vestigation. When he began about
two years ago, he says they com-
pletely refused to release any of the
information he requested. Eve adds
that the present administration of
Robert Kctter appears to finally be
opening some of the records to
scrutiny.

Eve also charges that SUNY‘s Af-
firmative Action program is not be-
ing properly adhered to. as well as
being inadequately funded.

Affirmative Action is at SUNY 7
wide program set up after Health

Education and Welfare Department
investigators uncovered widespread
hiring discrimination about three
years ago. Its aim is to increase the
number of minority group
employees in SUNYThc program
has set up unofficial quotas for the
University to meet. Afﬁrmative Ac«
tion is funded and operated directly
by SUNY Central Administration in
Albany. with a budget of several
hundred thousand dollars.

Evc calls this level of appropria-
tion “totally inadequate“ and thinks
it should be raised to near $700.000.
l’his amount of money would
provide an incre scd central ad-
ministrative staff as well asa staff for

cacti SUNY campus to oversee the
Affirmative Action Program on a
local basis.

The proposed I974 SUNY budget
calls for funding of one affirmative
action director on each campus.
which Eve calls “not enough."

He says that more money is need-
ed for Albany operations. ‘_‘With 72
campuses scattered around the state.
Central Administration just doesn‘t
have enough money to check on
everybody." Eve asserts.

the Assemblyman also criticized
the proposed SU NY budget for what
