Assembly Votes To Allow Tenants To Sue Lon

Governor Wilson's budget suf-
fered a cut of $63 million by the state
legislature's ﬁscal committees this
Wednesday.

This reduces the proposed budget
plan for the state‘s next ﬁscal yearto
a still record-level $9.31 billion. Two
areas which were heavily slashed by
the committees were the proposed
spendings in the areas of education

'and the arts. as well as several

proposed new state programs.

The budget plan now rests in clos-
ed conferences among the
Republican and Democratic
legislators since being presented to
them on Wednesday. after the
legislature had formally recessed for
the week.

It now is expected that the budget
plan will pass as is during next
week's legislative sessions.

In extensive budget chopping. the
committees allowed onIySI9 million
of the 530 million which Wilson re-
quested lor the state's cultural
organi/ations. and denied a re-
quested allotment for a contrmersial
program which would produce
cassette l.V. programs Ior lourth
grade social studies classes. which
would have cost $4.4 illion.

Ilte state uni -. y saw 59.1
million trimmcdﬁ its already
tight budget. an that; committees
recommended that student campus
overseas programs be placed tn a
moratorium. Ibc IUsllllClllIOH tor
the trimmingi ot campus ap-
propriations was that student
enrollments have slithllilcd. The
Sl\\ budget now totals $578
million tor the next Iiscal year.

 

llte committees denied funds lor
sc\cra| programs proposed by
Wilson. includingS7.2 million which
\\;is to prepare lor increased arrests
c\pcctcd under the new harsh state
drug law. the committee pointed
otit that drug arrests have not in-
creased so lar. l)a_\ can: and prison
construction programs also met the
committee's disapproial and were
denied. -\ SIS million day care
program had been planned.

()ric item not cut by the com-
mittees was .i 12 percent across-the-

(AP) The Assembly has approved
an anti — obscenity bill which con-
tains a list of sexual activities so ex-
plicit that it caused giggling and
tittering during debate.

the bill. approved l09 — 26 on
Monday. would ban “patently offen—
sive“ sex oriented material which
“taken as a whole. lacks serious
literary. artistic. political or scien-
tilic value."

The Senate approved a measure
with similar itttcnt last week. But the
two houses‘ versions differ greatly.
and there is no indication whether a
compromise betwccti the two can be
reached.

llotli bills would drop the current
standard banning orin material that
is “utterly without redeeming social
