(CPS) In higher education it
might be said that one thing is cer-
tain — tuition will go up.

However. recent national reports
recommending increases in tuition at
public institutions and moves by
many state legislatures to do so have
resulted in a ﬁrm commitment to the
concept of low tuition by both
private and public educational
organirations. as well as widespread
debate on the subject.

Carnegie Recommendation

Much of the debate has concerned
reports by the Carnegie Commission
on Higher Education and the Com-
mittee for Economic Development
(CED) recommending that tuition in
the public sector be increased in
order to ease the ﬁnancial plight of
the private sector and to make the
two more competitive.

The debate has also centered on
recommendations in the reports that
tuition increases be accompanied by
corresponding increases in student
aid.

Aside from all the controversy.
tuitions base been increasing at both
public and priiatc institutions. The
reasons gisenior recent increases are
inllation. higher costs. the energy
crisis and decreased reienues irom
other sources.

.4.
Studies show avg} tuition and
tees in public insti uttons hate in-

creased 44 percent in the last lite
years. For the l972 Jyear public
tunion rose 3.6 percent tor in state
studcnisand 43 percent lot out oi

state students.

lirieily. the Carnegie Commission
ud\t)t:ttlt:d increasing turtions at
public institutions in er the nest ten
years to a lesel oi one third ol in-
structional costs. along with

recommendations that a lowtutition
policy be maintained for he ﬁrst two
years of schooling.

the more radial CED report said
tuition should be increased over the
next live years at four —~ year in-
stitutions and over the next ten years
at two » year institutions until it
covered one hall' of instructional
costs.

Oppose Increases

Among the organizations that
have taken strong stands against tui-
tion increases are the National
Association of State Universities
and Land Grant Colleges
(NASULUC) which represents ma—
Jtll’ state uniicrsities and accounts
lot 30 percent at the student popula-
tion: the American Association oi
