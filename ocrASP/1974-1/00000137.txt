'  But Not 

The Lost Picture Show occupies a
place in the culture of America adja-
cent to that of Orson Welles‘ The
Magnificent Ambersons and
Sherwood Anderson's cycle of short
stories “Winesburg, Ohio."

But academic references aside. it is

a funny, sexy. touching. totally real
and human movie- a narrative of life
in a bleak. one-horse Texas town in
l95l. Or to be more specific, it is
about that particular year when you
leave high school and are groping
your way to some grasp of
adulthood - work, the Army. sex
and/or marriage. It is about the lives
that make their imprint on yours.
sometimes with tenderness or excite-
ment. Irequently with confusion ahd
pain.

Director Peter Bogdanovich‘s
capturing of a period - although shot
twenty years later - is an uncanny
time capsule. Robert Suitces
photographed it in a black and white
that is more eloquent and sensitive
than Technicolor. The lilm is a work
nl narrative art in the tradition of the
great American films of the ‘3lt‘sand
‘4t)‘s.

As its mythic center stands Ben
Johnson. as Sam the Lion, a throw-
back to a past western tradition and
integrity. who now runs the town‘s
pool room, diner. and one-aisle
movie house. Timothy Bottoms and
Jeff Bridges are the two high school

seniors. no longer boys and not yet
men. groping with girls in the shabby
back row of the theatre. while Father

elegantly udreelﬂirﬂhc screen.

An air oi suppressed sex broods
overthe town like twister clouds. It is
not sensationalism. but the tension
of lives lived in qutet desperation.

  

 
  
  

Bottoms has an affair with Cloris
Leachman. the panicky. middle-
aged wife ofhis coach. It isapathetic
seduction in which the older woman
is as nervous as the inexperienced
boy. and Miss Leachman won an
Academy Award for the compassion
other performance. But she won the
Oscar away from Ellen Burstyn, who
was nominated for her portrayal of
the ull-too-wise. restless wife of the
town‘s richest oilman.

But there is no point in cataloging
the Oscars and awards. because the
ﬁlm is the sum total of ind'nidual ex-
cellence. In her first screen role.
