Thugs On Campus

Ten-year-old Martin was playing at a pin-
ball machine in the Campus Center while
waiting for his father. Professor Zitelli. who
was attending a faculty meeting. Three
students approached Martin, lured him to a
deserted room. demanded the money from his
billfold. struck him when he refused to hand it
over and then grabbed the money and split it
among themselves.

This incident. occurring on Monday.
February I l. was described by Prof. Zitelli. of
the Dept. of Hispanic and ltalian Studies. in a
letter to the ASP on Tuesday. March 5. In the
letter he asks for a written apology from the
three culprits to appear within two weeks in
the campus paper.

I‘ knew that the type of cowardly thugs
described in this incident would not admit
their actions. but I looked in later editions of
the ASP to see what response would be elicited
from other letter writers. columnists. and
editorialists. l was a little surprised, but not
\ery much. to see absoluter nothing.

I'rn stire .‘Vli. Nixon must ltcmble in his
kneestoheartliattheASl'iscallinglorhisini-
peaehment. and maybe the ASP should call
tor the routing at all the crooks in Washington
but. just the same. morality begins at home.

I do not know howother students felt about
l’rol. Zitelli‘s letter. or whether anyone read
his letter. but I know it bothered me. ltdid not
bother me. perhaps. so much because ol the
act itself apparently tlielt is commonplace
on this campus but it bothered me because
at the question the boy‘s lather posed at the
end of his letter: "ls there any longer responsi-

I cannot answer that one.

But lean ask a tew questions myself.

mainly by students. State Universrty of New
York at Albany students. Should not someone
adk what kind of students are coming to
SUNYA'! Should not someone ask what kind
of admission standards we have here that per-
mit such criminals to enroll on campus?
Before we ask Mr. Nixon why he hired so
many crooks, should not we ﬁnd out who
brought so many crooks to SUN Y's campus?

The signs are all around, but other students
fail to mention it. ls it not pathetic. for in-
stance. that someone has to check the
students“ bookbugs and pocketbooks when
they leave the library since so many of our
bookreaders are thieves'! Is it not a sad com—
memory on the student body that a uniformed
gttard has to be posted at the exit ofthe aim-
piis bookstore to keep booksand records from
being “ripped off!“ Does it not bother anyone
to see moronic slogan painters defaceorie.ol the
country‘s most beautiful campuses with their
imbecile political sayings and idiotic nothings?

Does the clown. for instance. who lately has
been painting in blue-stenciled letters the word
"iii/lard" on the stone columns on the
podium really boost his pathetic little ego by
such acts‘.’

Tales of Telethon

Like other, unique events which occur with
regularity throughout the year. Telethon neat-
ly serves as a landmark by which to measure
that a certain part of your life is passing by
again. Although this time it‘s thrown a little
off schedule, being a month later than you
remember it. the spirit of the season remains.
The snow is gone or going. and this is a final
indoore‘vent before the grand attempt to come
out of hibernation.

The Night tends to sneak up on you. sothat
without fully realizing it. beginning with Fri~
day morning. you spend the next 30 or so
hours awake with the result that the rest ofthe
weekend is not worth very much either. As it
passes by you recognize that this entire ex—
perience has occurred belore: past memories
intcrniingle with the hazy present to produce a
mosaic of unreality.

Between 4 and 9 the voices of the student
organirers croak with fatigue. those acts held—
up nod offin the fireside lounge. Finally. one
excited participant runs in to inform that your
group goes on in less than a halfhour. tltistime
for sure. You drag together your body. which
is scattered about the empty room: full of
coats. barren of life. Some dope might roll out
to pick up the :spirits.. but they begin to scar
on their own as you realize you'll be perfor—
ming before people. you‘ll be part of an act
with mikes and lights.

The side crew and WSUA people and most
everyone else ﬂoating around in back of the
stage have seen this same phenomenon
happen live minutes ago and an hour before
and will witness it again two hours from now.

“research and writing in contem-

manage to filter in. Anyone who. in
the wake of the energy crisis. has
prayed for the recently demised shut-
tle hits while being blown to the gym
knows the defenses aren‘t foolproof.
And. even though Dr. Benczet stated
in I970. “lftlie rise ol'drugs comes to
the attention of the administration
and authorities. we can‘t look the
other way and they have to act. I
can't tell the outside authorities
“but to do. htit I would be disturbed

licult not to see the fun in u Com-
munity Day in which we are put on
display and sought out by
"laymen" desperately trying to dis’-
cover the truth in the myths.Efforts
by Dr. Benczet to reach the com-
munity via the College of General
Studies have also ﬂourished. We go
out to them by way of Community
Service. they come to us for instruc-
tion and everyone gains a deeper un-
derstanding of everyone else's dis-
contentment.

In addition to Community Service
there are other academic programs
which have been reaching outside
the university. In the last couple of
years the Journalism program.
directed by William Rowley has
grown into it second-ﬁeld discipline
with Albany State students working
as interns for local newspapers. The
Political Science Department also

' vironmental

sponsors interns who work mostly in
the State Legislature. The En-
Forum, which was
always quietly there. expanded
greatly under the leadership of Lou
lsmay. Environmental Studies is
now a major and students are out
working on projects including
archaeological digs in Pine Bush and
scenic preservationinthearea's parks.

A lot ofthe idealism is gone. The
new Pass-Fail system praised by an
ASP editorial in I969 has since been
modified almost to the point of
abandonment. Graduate schools
and the shrinkingjob market seem to
have won this round. You probably
could not get a student strike
together today. Nevertheless. things
are being doiie and even though our
causes are our own. our methods
seem to be ressembling those ol'our
parents more and more.
