Term
Responses

Aterm-paperscandalthatcameto
light last academic year prompth
widely varying administrative
responses from the eight major un-
iversities in the Boston area. accor-
ding to an. article in the March 25
issue of The Chronicle of Higher
Education.

The other three universities
Boston. Brandeis. and Tufts Univer-
sitites' instituted , proceedings to
determine the guilt or_ innocence of
the students involved. and punished ‘5
thoseafound gtiifty of infractions.

l the SLhIr‘o‘nicle. higher
edgcaltiopss weekly newspaper.
reports that five ofthosc institutions
Boston College. Harvard University.
Northeastern University. the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. and the University of
Massachusetts took nodisciplinary
action against students whose na tires
were found on the customer lists Ul
companies that were selling term
papers. Some refused even to look at
evidence implicating their students.

The institutions-\which declined to
take action did so quietly. often in
hehind-the-scenes negotiations early
last year with Boston University.
which had gained possession of the
students' names in a successlul legal
sutt against several companies that
had been selling term papers.

 
  

aper Scandal—Produce Varied

 

 

 

 

From Boston Universities

Mr. Silbcr saiditlierc were “hun-
drcds" of names involved. He com-
plained that the universities had
largely “swept under the rug the
whole scandal of term-paper
production." a scandal which. he
said. ltas “now become a national
scandal."

“When Boston University led the
successful legal light to put these
lirins out ol~ business. we discovered
in their files the names ofcustomers
from every major iiistitution\ in
melropolitari Boston. We found.

when we checked with these other
universities. that they were not in-
terested in having the names. 'l’hcy
intended to do nothing about it."
Mr. Silber said.

No details ol'the negotiations were
made public at the time, But the
general outlines ofthc situation were
revealed this month by John R.
Silbcr. the blunt-speaking president
oI Boston University. in an angry
speech to the American Association
for the Advancement til Science.

ed that many letters from the
theatre‘s marquee have been taken.
He requests that if any students
havethem they be returned.

He stated that the large green
letters are eight dollars apiece and
that the smaller red ones are four. At
least fifty letters liavelieentaken. It is.
therefore. quite expensive for the
theatre to continue replacing stolen
letters.

Woods. in a friendly manner. said
he merely wanted to appeal to the
students. “If they do have them. I

.Bill Would Allow Students

by Bob Moyer/(SASU)

A bill that would allow college
students to inspect their personal
files and correct any mis-statemcnt
with their own comments has been
co-sponsored by Republican
Senator John Flynn and Democratic
Assemblyperson Tony Olivieri. The
legislation. presently under review in
the Assembly Education Com-
mittee. would amend part of the
education law that relates to the dis-
closure of information held in a
student's personal file.

the measure specifies that any‘
college or university presently main~
tinaing records “other than grades“
must inform the student that such a
record exists and the date upon
which the files began. Students
iiotrld be permitted to inspect their
own record and supplement the in-
formation containcd in the tile with
any document or comment they
believe to be relevant to the record.
this could be done at least once per
semester and at “rrcasonable inter—
\als thercalter."

Assemblyperson Olivieri believes
the hill is necessarysbecause of an in-
crease in public demand for personal
privacy. Noting that student ﬁles
have long been a matter of conten-
tion. Olivieri claims that now the
issue has come :alive on a national
level and points to proposed legisla-
tion sponsored by Congressperson
deard Koch that goes beyond
students and includes tiles kept on all
eiti/ens. including members of Con-
gress.

legislators and citizens. in well u the
Watergate furor has added
significance and impetus ,for his
proposed legislation here in New
York State.

The legislation was strongly sup‘
ported by the City University Stu-
dent Scnate. However. one objection
has been raised by the Student
Associationof the State University
(SASU). Legislativcc Director Ray
(.ilass argues that it has been consis-
tent with SASU policy to withhold
support for any legislation that
would involve outside agencies in
matters that are of peculiar concern
to the university.

(i‘liiss argues that the proposed
legislation cncroachcd upon a un-
iversity governance matter and
might best be handled internally
within the SUNY system. Enactment
of such legislation might set a bad
precedant for legislative involve-
ment in internal State University
matters at some future date, Glass
lcels. He adds. however. that the
goal of the proposed legislation-
alltiwing students to inspect their
personal records-is a sound one.
