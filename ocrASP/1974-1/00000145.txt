called a resounding success in
' eliminating roadside litter.

A study by the federal En-
ironmental Protection Agency

Oregon Environmental Council.
The bottle bill. legally the

high percentage at these were lro

dropped from 37 percent to l8.9 per-f3

And the deposit law seems to have'
resulted in a reduction in litter in"
general in the state. A researcher forgg
the Oregon Depiirtment of En-’

reported that “The bottle bill has
created an atmosphere where people

‘ Mare-Federal Loans Next Fall

by Nell Klan/(CPS)

WASHINGTON—After some
congressional inﬁghting, a recent
House compromise has! virtually
guaranteed/that students from mid-
dle income families will have an
easier time getting subsidized federal
guaranteed loans next fall.

An informal compromise just
reached in the Special Education
Subcommitteet of the House has
cleared the way for.the eliminatioh
of the “nepdsvtest‘lfar many of next
year's Guaranteed Student Loan
(GSL) applicants}

The agreement came after con-
siderable dispute in the House over
amending one section of the GSL
program# the need! analysis~
without totally reevaluating federal
funding for higher education'. t

Under the previous law. any stu-
dent applying for a GSL had to
prove financial "need" in order to
qualify for government payment of
loan interest during the student's
school vears. The needs analysis was
determined by an independent
testing association which analyzed a
liiiiiily‘s linrincial statement and
reported how much the lriritily v\as
supposed to pay toward a student's
educational costs.

Until last year under the
provisions of the Higher Education
Act of l965. the government
automatically had paid the interest
subsidies foul! students with a fami-
ly income of under $l5.000.SfUaéTlT§

“from- wealthier families also got low
cost loans. but notinterest subsidies.

However. in I972 Congress had
amended the law to provide interest
payments for all students who could
prove financial need regardless of
family income. That change went
into effect last March.

Supporters of the I972 amend-
ment had said its purpose was to ex-
tend aid to a broader range of
students. not to apply the needs test
to the undcr—SlS.000 group.
However. the Department of
Health. Education and Welfare
(HEW) had interpreted the amend-
ment to mean that all applicants had
to pass the needs test.

Subsequently. some students from
laniilics with incomes under $|5.tl00
were jttdged to have “zero need“ by
the testing organiuttion.

Many complained that the
organi/ation's estimates were not
realistic because the inflationary
period the economy has been in pttt
the rtecds analysis totals at least two
years behind.

As a result the number} of
guaranteed loans granted
March to December ol last year was
oll' JZ‘ i'vcompared to I972. when the
needs test had been applied to the
lower middle income group.

lwo weeks ago the Senate passed
an amendment to a House bill that
would eliminate the needs test total!
loans applied lor by the undcr~
$|5.UUtl group. This amendment
sponsored by Clariborne Pell ( [)-R l)
was sent back to the House Educa-
tion and Labor Committee.

Meanwhile Senator James
()‘l-lara (D-MI) introduced a
separate hill into the House that
would clirriinate the needs test lor
families with incomes under $20.!)th
applying for loans of less than 5'2,-
tllltl. lhat bill was sent to the House
Subcommittee, on Education. ot
which ()‘llarii is chairman.

Opposition to the Senate bill iii
the llotrsc had centered oiri the
desire of certain Republican
nicrnbcr's. led by Albert Quic (R-

There had also been some tlpptlkl»
