G.M.,

(ZNS) A US. Senate subcom-
mittee has been told that General
Motors and a number of other
American corporations contributed
substantiallyto the German war ei-
Eorts during World War Two.

Bradford Snell. an economic
researcher and staff member at the
iU,s, ISenate monopoly and anti-
irust subcommittee, testilicd that
Ford. (i.M. and Exxon proiited
handsomely during the war by
supplying war material to both the
ttllies and the axis powers.

"Snell, in a copywrighted statement
republished by Detroit‘s Fill/i Ex-
law. says that American-based mul-
tinational corporations began es-
tablishing subsidiaries in Germany
in the l920‘s and ‘30‘2. G.M.. as an
example. acquired Germany‘s
largest automobile company

Adam Opel All. in I929. he states.

Snell reports that Hitler‘s govern-
ment awarded the order of the
Golden Eagle to a General Motors
executive. and the Nazi German
Tiaglc to a Ford executive lor their
companies“ contributions to the
Na/i‘s expanding war machine in
I938.

When war broke out. says Snell.
Hitler’s administration did not con—
iiscatc many ol the iorcign con-
trolled companies. Instead.
American-owned subsidiaries were
permitted :to remain operating In
private hands as long as they turn»
ed out tanks and planes inst 'ad ot
automobiles.

US. intelligence reports quoted
by Snell found that subsidiaries
united by (i.M. and Ford "Built
nearly 90 percent ol"the Armour

than 70 percent oi the Reich's
medium and heavy duty trucks."
Snell adds that (i.M. subsidiaries in
Germany manufactured bombers
and jet engines for the Nazi airl'orce
that were lar more advanced than
anything, (i. M. was producing in the
United States at the time.

Snell states that the multinational
corporations apparently wereable to
keep up contact during the war. He
told senator. “ ‘ommunications as
well as material reportedly continued
to How tor the duration oi the war
between (i.M. and Ford plants in
allied countries and those located in
