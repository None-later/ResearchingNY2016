In the soul market today are two
albums that ltave made quite a pop-
_u|ar impact upon the charts. Both
the Spinners and Aretha Franklin‘s
newest albums lack little in motion
and pleasure. Both outstanding
grotip arid artist have their latest
albums together so  stop buying
the single and start picking up the
albums.
