'by Vinnie Redri

I would not. normally. start an ar-
ticle with a personal statement. but
sirtce a misstatement ol' l'acts in my
March l9 article on the non-
returning varsity basketball players
could have damaged the public int-
age of a laudable organi/ation. l l'ecl
art apology is only lair.

the story made mention ol'“ltear-
taches" tell by the Alumni Associa-
tititt over tlte nttntber ol' blacks who
started on tltis year's squad. A closer
checking til tlte lacls woultl ltave

my sincerest apologies lor the cute
innuendo which. iii wltat l lcel to be
an otherwise accurate article.
promulgatcs itsell as a monument to
itiisjudgntent.

I‘Itere were many non-racial ex-
planations l'ortlte lalling rill inatten-
daitee at this year's gantes. although
Alhatty State coach Richard “Doc”
Sorters does admit that “the racial
controversy at the start til the season
iitigltt ltave beeti a lactor.“ the more
direct reasons. however. lte says.
were that “we got oil to a slower start
than usual l7-éll and we didn't do
too well in the Capital District lour-
rtariteitl here."

Another lactrir is that the quality
ol ball played this year at Albany
State. although olteit itiorc exciting.
did not rrtcrease sigititicantly ll'Um
the year belorc. or even lrom the
year helore that. llte team has kept
basically tlte sante scltedule and per-
tormcd basically as well. but no
better. against it. Stagnation. history
has shown. is neither nurnerreally
nor aesthetically popular.

lo end this condition. Albany
needs to attract more hiin school
standouts. and particularly the taller
ones. llirs would be the maon step
toward improving the team‘s
schedule and pciloimance. As
Sauers says.howeveiy“rri compete tor

Sitticr's does poittr out that iii a
way. Albany is getting it higher
quality ol athlete becattsc ol' the
inricli higher costs which private iri-
stitutioiis demand. artd “there are
not many schools in this part of the
country that can giv - a mart money

llic answer to the problem
probably does not lay iii the deep
recesses ol the rindcrgraduatcs'

face year alter year.

From the middle of February until

titude ol‘ diverse activities. Be it
AMlA l‘loor hockey. indoor soccer.
or women's tennis. the gym is con-
stantly in use. and Albany's athletic
teams are finding far too little time
for valuable. much-needed practice.

llte eortsensus among the coacltcs
ol spring teams is that some sort ol
building. whether it be a licldhousc
or even a temporary btrbble. is
drastically needed ritit only lor'
