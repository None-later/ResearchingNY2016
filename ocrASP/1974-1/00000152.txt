representation among students as a
group. and laculty and administra-
tioti as another group. on the Board
of Directors. in addition. it
recommends art increase of students
to the membership board. with the
President and Vice-President ol'SA.
and Chairperson and Vice-
(‘Iirtrrperson ol Council to be

others would bertppointed by the SA

Students are in a better position.

are closer to the people affected by
student-related discussions and are
generally more interested in policy
