ning the State University's I974

ghly the same level ol‘l'unding as last

lor next year will he cut. including
graduate leIIottships. the University
Press. Student Assembly. and
possibly the eontrot ersial (‘ollege at

sectors“ as reflected in the scaled
down University budget requests
during the past few years.

Downstnte Democrat support

I here are a few lawmakers. mostly
downstate Democrats. who say that
SUNY should get everything it is
asking for. Leonard Stavisky is one
such person.

Slavisky also believes that then:
should he ito tttition in SUNY. ’I'ui-
tion is presently used to pay the debt
service on the billions of dollar.|
worth ol' capital construction done
d uring the last decade.
Assemblyman Stavisky also thinks
SUNY should make it enrollment
iitoie opeii. although not as open as
the ('it)‘ University ((‘IINYt.

timates the budget surplus this year
as boil] bctWeen $350 and $400
million. and thinks that because of
this surplus the state has a respon-
sihility to better fund the University.

Another SUNY supporter is
Senator Abraham Bernstein. All he
would cut lrom the budget is the con-
troversial Instittite for PolieylAIter-
natives.

Assemblyman Franz Leichter.
known among college students for
his sponsorship ot legislation to
