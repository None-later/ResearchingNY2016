enjoy equality with the non-student
world in the way of ‘privacy. freedom
. and individual life styles. butwhen it
1 comes to rent - look out.

Students are paying an average of
$34 per room, as compared to an
average of $16 per room for non-
eampus renters in the City of
Albany. This fact was uncovered in a
report compiled last fall by four
Albany State students,who also
found stich facts as the average I67
percent differential in the prices
charged to students than to non-
students, This figure pertains to the

the I700 identified students in the
report.
