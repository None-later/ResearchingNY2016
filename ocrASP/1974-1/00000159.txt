.  World of Difference

A synopsis of the week‘s events revolving around the Watergate incident and related
events serves once again to demonstrate to the nation the depths to which the Nixon
Administration has sunk in the past two years. The ﬁrsituse of White House tapes in
court produced no repudiation ofany testimony given by former White House counsel
John Dean. as had been promised by the President and Senator John Stennis who said
be h and the tapes. Stennis had said months previously that once the public heard the
tapes. it would prove that Nixon was innocent of any implication in Watergate. the
Vesco case. and all of the other dirty business that has come to be associated with Nix-
on politics. He said that John Dean would be a man discredited before the nation.

.lohn Dean is not discredited by any means. The defense attorney for John Mitchell
grilled Dean for days on almost every detail of his testimony. yet he could not shake
him. What this means is that if Dean‘s account of the Robert Vesco contribution is as
accurateas it appears to be. thenlthe corruption which Nixon has promised us neverex-
isted is decidedly pointing”, to his closest frieitds and advisors. The nation has been
pounded now all yveek with the testimony coming out ofthe Robert Vesco campaign
contribution case. and as each day passes. the trail leads inexorably and inevitably
toward the President.

l he latest result ofthat trial informs us that an ex-Securities and Exchange Com mis—
sion aide. (icorge Cook. met with former Nixon campaign chairman Maurice Starts iii
the middle of a rice field and talked about an exchange. In effect. Stans promised
Cook help in obtaining his muclt sotrght afterchairmansliip ol‘the SEC ifin return. he
would delete a paragraph from an SEC testimony that said outright that Robert
Vesco illegaly donated 5250.000 to the Nixon re-election fund. In fact. Cook r/I'rldclete
that paragraph front the SEC transcript and defended his action to other SEC officials
\y ho were ctrrious as to why he did it. Replied Cook: Do we areally need that much
detail? We are talking about a $250 million theft scheme. why should $250,000 make
much dillerence'.’

Wheti that $250.000 is given to the President‘s election catnpaign from the same man
who had just stolen $250 million. yes. Mr. Cook. it would make a lot ofdifl'ercncc.

Certified Public Accountability

lhe Senate is currently considering ti proposal to finance Presidential and ('on-
gressionttl elections with public funds. The proposal won a key test this week when art
attempt to delete it from a campaign reform bill was defeated by a wide margin. The
hill/still faces a long light in the Senat *. an even tougher one if it is passed and sent to
the House. and finally the probability ofa Presidential veto. Yet. theabusesofthis past
Presidential electiory' make it clear that some form ofpublic ﬁnancing is necessary. The
tornier Attorney General of the United States is on trial for allegedly covering up a
5200.000 contribution to Mr. Nixon's election campaign and quasltingan investigation
of the man who donated the money. Several major corporations have admitted SCCTL‘lIJ'
donating large sums ofmoney to the President‘s fund. Big business must no longer be
the principal determinant of election outcome a President should not owe favors to
these tndust_ries. often at the expense of the people.

 

Several Congressmen and Senators. as well as President Nixon. have opposed the
m-asure on the grounds that the American people will not stand for having to con-
tribute to all candidates. including ones they do not wish to see iri office. More to the
point. perhaps. is that officeholders with great private backing do not wish their op-
ponents to have equal sums of money. Contributions to Mr. Nixon's campaign far
dwarfed those to Senator McGovern‘s. making it an uphill light for the Senator under
any circumstances. It is no wonderthat the President plans to veto the hill. hitt it is time
that the rich no longer claim a huge. often unbeatable. advantage over tliru'r opponents
lrom the first; day of the campaign. Public financing would provide equal. or nearly
equal. sums ol money to the two opponents in a race; for once. money would not b ' a
factor irt deciding the outcome. and a man could be elected on what he has done while
in\ ollice. and not on what he has accumulated.

Ford Moves On Right To Privacy Front

 

WASHING | ()N Several weeks rigu I
reported on an executive order signed by
President Nixon instructing the Internal
Revenue Service to ttrrti over the incortte tax
returns ol the nation‘s three nitllioti lartiiers to
the Department ol Agriculture. to assist
lcdct‘til olltcttils tn compiling statistics on tltc

I lie I'rcstdcnt's stdcol the story was tltttt the

by mail or otlterwrsc to request lat triers to sub-
titit the necessary data voluntarily.

Now. Vice President (ierttld l rit‘tli. head of

In my view. botlt the actions and vrords ol

running for equal time to peruse the tax
returns ol its particular constituents. Such is
the nature ot the bureaucratic beast.

lltattks to (icrald l‘tll'tl. that nonsense has
been averted. at least tor the present.

Deliver Us From Evil

[‘0 the Editor:

't‘he presure to change the constitution in a
way which would virtually take away the right
of women to terminate an unwanted pregnan-
cy is increasing daily.

Two amendments are being considered: one
is by New York's Senator Buckley. which
would allow abortion only to save the life of
the mother. The other would not allow irhor-
iioii under any circumstances.

I he basis used for these amendments isthat
a letus is allegedly a person from the triorticnt
ol conception. if this premise is accepted. it
leads to some absurd legal questions. Sotne ol
these are: If a wornttn uses contraceptive
devices such as the [U I). is she a rtiurder'ciz tor

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

there is ample time left to consider the choices. -
Without. further ado then, i will announce my
candidacy for S. 'A.'Viee President. I would
like to express my‘qualiﬁiaitl’ons in terms of
my past S.A. activities and my ideas for next
year.

Last year. I served'as President of Alumni

Quad Board. In addition to becoming ac-
quainted with the int ricacics and problems of

- programming. I learned from this experience

to handle many administrative details which
would be valuable to me as S.A. Vice Presi-
dent.

l his year. I have served as Central Council
representative from Alumni Quad. I believe I
nave served with diligence and dedication. be-
ittg one of only three Council members who
have served since September with no unex-
cused absences. l have also shown a
willingness to devote my time to S.A. through
my involvement on various committees.

lhrottgh my service on the Budget Com-
tnittce and Finance Committee l have come
into contact with virtually every S.A. funded
group. Asa result. I have been made aware of
the purpose arid the activities ol‘all ofthcsc
groups. a Iactor that I consider essential for
the position ol Vice President. l have also
served as Vice Chairperson of the Election
Relorni ('onunittee which proposcda number
ol tar reaching ideas. some ofwhtch have been
accepted by Council. intended to increase and
Iticilitrttc stirdetit participation iii llll‘ elections
and to make the electiott process more
representative and democratic. ln tiddition.l
\L‘I'\i:d as ('hatrpcrson ol the Min mi Investiga-
trori committee. which made every effort to
discover what really happened surrounding
the entire bus trip alfair and to do whatever
possible to ensure that additional buses be
provided tor as many ol those it ho wanted to
go its possible.

As for my ideas [or next year. there are two
directions in which I would like to set: S.A.
move. l-trst ol all. I think that students pay a
large etiotiglr sum to obtaiti programming by
paying their $04 riititidatory strident tax. the
Esltttlctll should not be required tsayc inun-
lltSlltIl situations). to pay lor tin tictiytty twice
.by being lorced to pay high prices lot' the ac-
tivities tlieitisclycs. I would like to see S.A.
lll(|\L' III the direction ol tree or less expensive
prices charged stttdcrtts tti attend S. A lttndcd
cyents. As it means ol ttitikttig tip tot revenues
lost tor lowering prices I would cailltor a sharp
iticrettsc iii the prices charged to tiott
students. the nurtrber ol which is substantial
lot cycrits such its concerts itlltl high quality

Illtl\lt.'S.

Secondly. I would like to see rt grczttcr

pcttettcc its tr qtttid president has led me to
believe that the quads are the most direct ttrid
accessible lllL‘rtllS S. A. ltrtsto do sottiethtiig Itir

to provide most lienytly lot that which would
