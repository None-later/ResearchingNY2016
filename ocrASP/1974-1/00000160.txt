by Douglas LeCointe ,

New? York State lawmakers

appear to be moving in the direction
of making student activity taxes

voluntary. a step which would be a
significant victory for individual
freedom on New York‘s campuses
and a move which is long overdue.
Indeed. it is a rarity when state
legislators turn away from
authoritarian efforts to legislate
morality by abolishing pornography
and encouragingdrug bustsand turn
instead towards enlarging individual
freedom of choice. but several bills
have been introduced that would
prohibit or severely curtail the abili-
ty of student governments to charge
mandatory student activity fees. as
reported recently in the ASP.

Many students. especially those
conservatives or libertarians. have
undoubtedly looked aghast at thepor-
tion ‘of causes. movements. societies
and newspapers on campus which go
completely against their ethics.
values and deepseated political
beliefs and which the undergraduate
has no choice but to subsidize
through payment of mandatory tax-
es. As Senator John Marchi says.
mandatory fees at SUNY "are used
to subsidize newspapers which are
often repulsive to many students. as
well as to the taxpayers supporting

Ithcse institutions."

‘ The bill which Senator Marchi in-
troduced to amend the Education
Law would prohibit the use of man-
datory fees to support'wampus

"newspapers. The bill‘will “safegtiiird

...the civil liberties .ofvstudcntirso’that
their contributions will not be used
to subsidize causes with which they
differ and which are advocated

' without regard to their approval or

idisapproval."

i The Senator goes on to recom-

‘V mend that student newspapers com-
pete in the marketplace for
patronage. the students then being
free to purchase those publications
they dcsirc.

lhis makes sense. A student
should not be forced to subsidize
newspapers which consistently voicc
scntintcnts be or she abbors. A stu-
dent slioiild not be forced to support.
in addition. activities wlticli seem
repulsive and coliipletcly alien to his
or her value system.

lest I be iiccuscd of biting the
build that feeds me. so to speak. let it
be known that the ASI' has been
very fair. to my know ledge. at allow-
ing those wrth contradictory views to
present their opinions either throuin
editorial columns or on the letters
page. Nevertheless. the basic
political viewpoint is decidedly at
one end of the political spectrum.
much to the dissatisfaction of those
at the other end. Why should tliosc
wrtfi opposing politics he forced to
subsidlle their opposition?

In an ulna/trig bit ol convoluted
reasoning. the ASP of March 26.
Cdlltﬂllllllca‘ that the Legislature is
“infringing on the rights of students
at State-run universities to fairly and
legitimately tax themselves for pnr~
poses they see fit."

You've grit that the wrong way
arottirdl It is ltlil, the student
government. who is mlr mgrrig on my
right to spend riiy money as I see fit.
You have no rigltt to tax me for pur-
poses you see fit.

You say: “Any action infringing
student rights. CSDL‘UHIII) on issues
about which the pompous
Legislature knows little. if anything.
can only be viewed with ouiirigc."
‘ I say that II is ion. lllt' sltttlctll

The Harry-Sam Debates: Part I

by Lawrence H. Pohl

(The following is the ﬁrst in a
series of conversations between
Sam, the ecu-nut, and Harry. the
progress freak.)

Harry: Hey. what's happening
Sam. Save any ducks lately? Ha.
Ha... hey. only kiddin' what‘s up'.’

Sam: For your information you
may be eating ducks in a while alter
they kill all those contaminated
Chickens.

Harry:
chickens?

Sam: Didn't you read about the
million or so chickens who were led
grain so contaminated with dieldrin
pesticide that they were labelled un-
fit for human consumption?

flurry: ()K. Rachel Carson, when
was this. I968 or so‘.’

Sam: March. l‘)74. llarry. March.
I974.

Harry: Aw. so what. We‘ve grit

What contaminated

more chickens than we know what to
do with. Hey. Sam. look at Peter
coming in his new car. What a
beautiful sight. (iod bless GM!

Sam: Yeah. (iod bless GM. Oh.
and God bless the plastics industry
also.

Harry: ()K nut.what did they do
iiow‘.‘

Sam: It was discovered this week
that seven workers contracted
cancer from working too close with
vinyl chloride. a plastic. The
spokesman for the plant agreed that
more research should now be done
to determine the harm being done by
the indiscriminate dumping of car-
cinogens into our air and waters.
(ircat. huh Harry. :1 new industry
motto is born: “We poison now. you
pay later.“

Ilarry: Hey. Sam. did you ever
consider the possibility that those
chickens might have been suffering

chickens they throw‘on the ice at

Sam: They should throw you on
the ice at- hockey games!

Harry: Sorry. Sam. But you‘re so
down on industry. What about strip-
mining?

Sam: What about it?

Harry: We need energy, right?

Sam: Some, yes...but continue.

'Harry: With an energy crisis. coal
is abundant and thus would be the
most logical substitute fuel. Right?

Sam: Wrong. but continue
anyway.

Harry: So. what‘s wrong with a
company going in. tearing up the
ground. getting the coal out and then
rclandscaping the site. Result:
energy for us. nice landscape for the
bird-lovers like you. Sam.

Sam: Ifthe strip-niiningindustries
were so concerned with relandscap-
ing. why would they insist on a
provision to a Congressional bill
ptttting a three-year delay before
choosing to relandscape and in addi-
tion.even af‘tcrtlirceyears there is no
provision which makes companies
have to relrrndscapc at all! ’l'hus. us-

Result: Energy for us. dirty air lows

our "sea to shitiiiig sea" Americans.

Harry: Well. Sam. once again

For What It's Worth

by Bob Mayer

Several weeks ago a student who
has been here for sometime recalled
that not long ago this university

administration bttildiiig was ours
when we wanted II. A professor
when asked what he thought of the
latest college fad called streaking.
commented. “Students have gone
lroni striking to streaking. l guess
the administration has won."

Several years ago. to be a student
meant something. It meant that we
were willing to learn moretliari what
was bcilig spoon-led to us in
classrooms. licing a student was an
experiment iii experience. It was be-
ing part of it new tdcntrty. lt tirade lit-
tle difference if yort went to Kansas

As sttidcttts we were all brotliersiind

there was some cosmic cricrgy that
was directing it» ltttii it new critt-
sciousness. those who deny that

Not everyone participated in that
new energy. not everyone agreed
wttlt the politics of rebellion. not
everyone felt that we were all woven
into a common bond. yet the minori-
ty did and those who did not could
never tictl) that the energy. rebellion.
and crciitrveness was very powerful
and that it rattled the loundationsof
every university tn this nation.

We wanted more than
politicians. teachers. and
nimrstirrlors were offering tlti.
We wanted our four years III it till-
iversity to mean more than .i piece of
paper celebrating our mastery of
nothing. We were eager to learn
about our world out there and Wu
were willing toliiiike sacrifices to see
that it was changed. We weir not ill—
ttriiidutcd by their power. we ‘iIITIlllV

worked in spite of it. We were not
miprcsscd with words because our
educational experience clearly
stiggcslctl that they were
ntcrtntliglcss We could not be co-
opted because we could not be
bought with cheap assurances and
pctty ctittipt'onttscs

We walked through this campus
knowing tlittt slicer ntiritbcr alonc
iiiiidc II ours. We discarded manon
:ociety‘s old values. not just for the
sake of rebellion. but because we saw
how hypocritical and dehumanizing
those values were. We didn't have ti)
look hard.

We wattilcd so liiucli more than to
be ii social security number. We
wanted to be people who could con-
tribute constructively in shaping the
world we had to live It].

So \vc look around today and it

that creative energy. that moral com-
lnitliicnl has dtsslpalcd.

and tlicsc pcoplc liii\c not lost that
deep sense of caring.

litit what we have lost can't bc

I am inst orlc student who misses
those days. I remember what it was

The
Maior Producers

by Mitchel later

The story in last Tuesday‘s ASP
concerning the non-performance of
the Paul Taylor Dance Company
should not come as a great surprise
to those familiar with the Theater
Department at SUNYA. This inci-
dent simply represents one more in-
cident in the continuous saga of the
cliauvinistic. elitist attitudes ex-

hibited by many of the department‘s

students and faculty. As typified by
Tuesday‘s story. Theater Depart-
ment people seem to be constantly
forgetting that they are not an in-
sulin community functioning solely
to further their own personal iri-
terests. As part of the University. us-
ing Student Association money to
partially lurid their productions.
they owe some allegiance to the rest
of the school. yet tliedcpartinerit l'rc~
tiiieritly ncts only iii consideration of
what would be best for itself and its

friends.
szcellcnt examples of this
behavior can be Iourid within the

incidents surrounding 'Ilii' ll'i':ui'i/
u/ 0:. a production that was laced rill
along the line with favoritism and
bias. With the low til a free trip to

If soiiieol tlicnirmes in tliclezids

another favorite practice of “water

giving prime roles to students who
