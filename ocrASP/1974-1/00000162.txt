For those of you who might have
forgotten. one of the few bright spots
for America in the I972 Olympic
Games at Munich. Germanylwas the
victory of Frank Shorter in the
marathon (26 miles. 385 yards). His
performance marked the first time
that an American had won the event
since I908. when John .I. Hayes was
awarded the gold medal after the
front-running Italian got his direc-
tions mixed up with about 400 yards
to go.

Shorter‘s victory was more con-
ventional. or so it seemed to be until.
again. less than 400 yards to go. At
that point an imposterjumped from
the stands in Munich‘s vast stadium
and pretended to be Ieadingthe ﬁeld.
until he was politely escorted off the
track. You would think that some
rascal knew just how much trouble
that last 385 yards would create
when he thought up the race. At any
rate. Shorter won his gold medal and
thereby was crowned the unofﬁcial
title of the world‘s premieredistance
runner.

Well. Frank Shorter is scheduled
to appear in Albany this Sunday.
March 3]. along with up to 300 other
performers. many of whom do not
take their distance running quite as
seriously. All will be competing in
l H Ti BANKATHON. a 25
kilometer road race from Schenec-
tady to Albany. starting iit l2 noon.

twenty-five kilometers is only
|5.55 miles so Shorter may not be
worrying about that last 385 yard
hex. and for that matter. no one else
need worry about Frank Shorter. He
is the odds-on favorite to win. and he

possibly may shoot for the American
record for this distance of one hour.
seventeen minutes. and 50 seconds
(on average of 5 minutes per mile) if
the weather is good. I

Other ﬁne runners are entered.
however. and a team comprised
tnainly of Albany Statedistance men
are among the favorites to win the
team title. They will be led by cross-
country All American.senior Jim
Shrader. Other members are seniors
Bill Sorel and Vin Reda.
sophomores Carlo Cherubino. Gary
Furlong. and Leo Smith. and
freshman Chris Burns. In addition.
35 year old Donald Wilkcn. a
professor of Mathmatics at SUNYA
will join this group. which will call
themselves the Albany Track Club.

Competition for the first ten
places will be fierce. Both merchan-
disc and trophies will be given out to
these tem men after they cross the
finish line at State Street ind'owntown
Albany. in front of the National
Commercial Bank and Trust Com-
pany. which also. by coincidence. is
the sponsor of the meet. An added
inducement is the possibility that
Governor Malcom Wilson will be
there to hand out these top ten
awards (again. weather permitting.
since nobody enjoys a soggy govcr~
nor).

Ihere is still plenty til room.
however. for weekend joggers to cri-
joy some friendly competition.
lroplties “Ill be given out to no less
than the first l50 finishers. so if
anyone is interested. they can still
enter by calling Bill Shrudcr at 462-

4429. Free busses will leave from the
Albany YMCA on State Street (two
‘blocks below Draper Hall) at 9:30.
l0:00 and “:00 a.m.. Sunday mor-
ning.‘ and transport runners to the
starting line in front of Procter's

Theater on State Street in Schenec-
tady.

Busses will also be provided for
those runners who find. after the
race goes along. that their limited
talents have left them stranded

Field House Is The Solution To Problems

Last of a Two-Part Series
by Doug Lewanda

The truck and ﬁeld tcamhas more
of a problem. according to coach

'R.K. Munsey. a man highly out-

spoken on the subject. Coach
Munsey was blessed with 82 students
trying out for spring track this year.
Yet. many have quit. or have been
forced to leave the team due to in-
juries. illness and absolute frustra-
lion.

Some of the problems en—

countered by the Coach are as
follows: He cannot plan workouts in
advance whatsoever. In fact.
Coach Munsey doesn‘t know until
about an hour beforehand what kiird
of drills he will incorporate in the
day's practice because of the cons-
tant changes in the weather.

Unless the team is outside. it is
very difficult for the field events to
practice. Ihere is no place inside to
pole vault. and activities like hiin
jumping. the javclin. and discus

throwing are usually out ofthe ques-
lion.

If in the gym. it‘s very tough for
the Mtinseyrneri toconcentratelhe
adjacent room holds the baseball
teatn with its batting practice; and
the constant echo of groundballs
makes it difficult for the track man
to work on their game.

Ihe tunnels are air impossibility.
'I he hard cement floors have led to
quite a lcwanklc and knee problems.
along wittt shin splints. Also. for the
itiiddlc distance runners. one com-
plete lap of the "course" is only .64 of
a riiilc. and with it dip right in the
middle. it throws off the runner‘s
timing. the only decent maximum
yardage possible is the 880. but with
those sharp turns at the ends of the
podium. the runners must always be
nary ol tltc "innocent pedestrian."

lhc conslttttl inhaling of the
tiiniicl'» Iriiircx throws lltc riirtncis'
breathing cortiplctcly otrt of whack.
and those \titli an) kind of allergy

really suffer.

These are just few of the many
reasons that have led to many ﬁne
prospects. including three or four
potential nationals according to
Munsey. to call it quits or go
elsewhere because of the poor
facilities for truck ttnd ﬁeld.

"Not only that." continues
Munsey. “but the existing track we
have now is not so super. Yes. it has a
beautiful finish. and we can still run
on it. l’hel'acl renwinsthatthetruck
design is from 26-30 years old.
there‘s it lot of waste. The curlicues
on the ends aren‘t needed; no track
has them anymore. This one should
have been built with eight lanes.
because as it stands right now. we
can't how it national or even a
regional meet on our track. With
only \I\ limes. all we can do is ltave
duals."

wouldn't have to worry about the
equipment being blown over if the
wind came from the wrong direc-
tion."

Like the other coaches. Coach
Mtinsey looks further than his sport
when mentioning any kind of new
building. “It's not a question of
track. That's one tiny piece of sand
on the beach. It‘s a question of the
whole student body having areas to
do what they want to do in their
leisure time. The term ‘ﬁeldhouse‘ is
a misnomer there should be a Stu-
dent Activity Ccnter at Albany
State."

As far as atitttirc structure for
Albany is concerned there are still a
lot of question marks. In the fall of
PHI. l.5 million dollars was spent
on earth impaclation and sight
preparation near the Indian Quad
section of Perimeter
Road. It looked like it was going to
be an actuality. Brit just when things
were going to get started. there wasa
Ircrtreridous financial crtiriclt in the
state and the plan was shelved.

the proposal called for an It lv2
lltlllltttl dollar btirldiitg. with an cigltt
ltlllC. Sl\ lap track (there are only 15
other ones like that in the East). ati
ice privrllrort, art auditorium with a

basketball area with scalingcapactty

Arid it noiild bc \lL‘litlllL‘l) possible
to use part of this area for other
sports during triclcnicrit weather.

r\ltct that failure. a proposal for a
lcltt|tttt‘:tl\ liiihblc was put in at tt
crisl \\ ell imdcr ctght riitiliiorr dollars.
\et this “(IS defeated h) the people
tI\t‘l III the Construction Company
lor Plants and l'tlclllltch Ior theState

Universities and the Budget Com-
tiiittee.

Thus. a new building to 'ac-
cortiodate the current overflow of
functions remains a dream of the
future. With the plans for copstruc-
iioii of a new home at
Siena College. this leaves Albany
State. the Showcase of the
Northeast. as the only school in the
Capital District without such an
edifice. All there is to show for the
alloted space is the planting of
several hundred seedlings to ﬁll the
now barren areas. Is it feasable to
drop sortietlring after spending 20%
of tltc total cost? Now with inflation
rind increased costs. atab of from I2-
|5 iriillion is not very unreasonable.

"I don‘t know what our chances
are of getting a l’ieldhousc in the
future." says Coach Ford. “I think if
it does crime. it migltl blue to be
llllttthL‘d lrom our'side of state funds.
In other nords. possiny ouralumni
group or if possible sortie fund rais-
r n.- scltcme on campus."

loacli Ilrian Kelly of the men‘s

\Iltl team adds. "In I972-73,
\lhan- State took 2nd amongthe ll
\lI\\ AC schools in the merall var-
sity spoils standings. this is tremen-
