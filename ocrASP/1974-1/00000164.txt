0 State University"

by Blob Mayor

According to a Secret memoran-
dum marked “For Eyes Only.“ Presi-
dent Richard M. Nixon has been
offered the post of university presi-
dent. vacated. by President
Benzedrine. The offer was made by
the Vice-President of Academic Af-
fairs. Dr. Fillitup Satyric.

Reliable sources within the
SUNYA administration have in-
formed Kick thttt details of Mr. Nix-
on's transfer to Albany State are
presently being worked out by White
House staff and SUNYA dean.
l'ricky Dick Kennel.Kennel has
reportedly made several trips to
Washington in recent weeks to iron
out some dispttte over salary and
other fringe benefits. .

Our sources claim that at present
several areas ltnvc been agreed upon
by both sides. l'he uniVCrsity has
made plans to change its name to the
New Nixon ,State University. The
Iormer President will rcceivea base
salary of 546539534 annually and
two free comps for all university con-
certs. In addition the state legislature.
has agreed in advance to waive all
state taxes on the President's ear-

~nings.Mr. Nixon has recently chang-

ed his official residency from San
Clemente to San Quenton and
therefore is eligible for exemptions
on federal tax claims. .
Kit'lr-i/t-tlte-ASI’ has also learned
that the President will prohibit any
disclosure of official university

' material to any committees on the'

grounds that such procedure would
set a bad precedent and may damage
I'uturc- university presidents from
making decisions without fear of
accountability.

The President will have a work
load of I hour per week loallow him
time to finish his new book. “My
Continuing Crisis From Whittier
to Watergate." According to one
metnber of Satyric‘s staff. the Vice-
l’residcnt believes that Mr. Nixon
will contribute much to the universi-

‘ty and carry on the cstccntcd goals of

ltis predecessor.
Satyrit. also lecls that the former

i U. S. President would typify a long

lasting philosophy in this tutiversity.
a philosophy that permits the
broadest interpretation of ad-
ministrative flexibility within the un-'
iversity guidelines.

Catastrophic Calamities

: by (lo-go Rilltt

Horror struck Albany State‘s
campus last week when King Kong
ran amuk between the Quadsand the
buildings on the podium. Twenty
students died of laughter and many
others run around screaming. Kong
squashed trees and bit offseetions of
Livingston Tower.

Kong created havoc when he
climbed the Carillon. but then drew
some cheers when he ripped the elec-
tronic equipment out and stopped
the noon chimes. The ape was
followed as he went his destructive
way by biology students with
tnicroscopes. photographers.
streakers and Security men shouting
“Stop! You are trespassing!“ _

King Kong also caused damage
when he tripped over the Infirmary;
he'l‘ell with his head in the Power
Plant‘s smokestack. which caused
him to sneeze. which made a terrible
mess anti smell and caused many
Dutch Quad residents to go to their
I'riends' rooms on other quads.

Kong‘s actions. It read in part: “The

institution. We resent the im-
plications of a-large ape del'iling the.

terfering with the education ac—
tivities that are in process here.“

Studenl reactions were varied.
The hysterical students could not be
interviewed: one girl in Ten Broeck

chair. Many students were “under
the influence" and were able to
thoroughly enjoy the "show."
