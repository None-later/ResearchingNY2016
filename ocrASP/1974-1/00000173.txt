“Welfare for Whom" was the

. question focused on by Leon Van-
Dykc and Stephen Werner during a
casual discussion arranged by the
Academic Activities Committee.

‘ The talk Tuesday night in 85255 was
designed to dispose of certain myths
surrounding the controversial
welfare system.

The speaker‘s goals were to “take
attention away from the welfare
mother. the AFDC (Aid to Families
of Dependent Children) image. and
to show that there are many in-
dividuals in our society who enjoy
some sort of an income subsidy."

Werner dealt with broadening the
idea of what constitutes welfare. Dis-

ARDLD, FINKILE

tributing welfare checks to people
below the poverty line is not the only '
form of public assistance. Werner
sees the tax and subsidy systems in
this country as forms of governmen-
tal aid which go to the non-poor.

From the charts and tables he used
the statistics proclaimed that the tax
structure does not fulfill its function
of income distribution. In other
words. due to tricks like oil depletion
allowances and misapplied farm
subsidies. the rich get richer and the
poor pay more taxes.

’I'heret‘ore. the government. due to
inappropriate tax structure and sub~
sidies gives "welfare". to the more
affluent classes. Werner's solution.-

Leon VanDyke. a grad student in
the Educatiort Department. wanted
to clear up our understandingol'who
is actually receiving welfare funds.

Although he has worked with
welfare rights groups here in Albany.
he stated that he “was not an expert
and had a limited view of public
assistance.“ However. his goal was
to show that the average welfare
recipientsare not black women with
excessively large families and no
husband .(muvbc with him

VanDyke explained that out ofthe

there are 2 or 3 children per family.

remember that “there just aren‘tjobs

To dispute the notion that the
funds allowed by the government are
squandered by “cheaters” the follow-
ing facts were presented.

One third of the total allowance
goes to train and pay the workers in
the system itself. Out of the actual
check a fixed rate for utilities and
rent is taken out. In fact. a big
problem for these families is that in
winter it more gas is used than
alloted for in the check. they must
dip into the food or recreation
money or their power is cut off.

The discussion branched off into
the manylproblems inherent in the
system. Out of the nine people par-

rest were students with expertise in
economics and social welfare.

Mark

by Maureen D. Grim

From among the majestic cor¥
ridors of the Iegisltttivc office
building. aloud noise emanates from
the office of Assemblyman Herbert
.l. Miller(l)-l“orcst Hills). The noise
is a voice cornitig from an extension
of the intercom belonging to Willis
Stevens. (Rep-Brewster) as he
presents the NY. State fiscal bttdgct
to the assembly. four floors below.

The lone tenant in the two room
carpeted office is a legislative intern.
l'otel from S.L'.N.Y.A.'s
(iraduate School of Public Affairs.
Settled behind it big front desk. he is
submerged in paperwork.

"Would you like to sit down? Mr.
cutter is at the meeting downstairs."

“What is vour job here?“ | ask.

‘Well. I do everything from work-
ing with bills. to answering phones
and opening mail to attctrding
derrioeratic caucuses.“

Matty of the 40-50 S.U.N.Y.A.
grads and undergrads currently in
the program do other such tasks as
designing surveys of constituency.
policing job input of a profession.
legal research and research of
histories of bills or projects.

Dr. James Riedel. coordinator of
the innovative legislative intern
program sits legs crossed in a revolv-
ing chair. hands folded behind his
head in his S.U.N.Y.A. office. in an
atmosphere far removed from that
ol the Assemblymrtn‘s chaotic
qttarters.

students who elect to take the 3—6
credits of independent study at the
capitol must contact hint after com-
plctiorr ol the prerequisite: either

requirement was made so that a stu-
dent will have a basic working
knowledge of the system before be-
ing immersed in it.

It is mandatory also that a student
applyrrig [or art internship contact
on their own the legislator tltcy lll'c
interested in working for. says
Ricch. He points out that
placements cart almost always be
made as students are :symbiotically-

Ricch says that students cannot
be lull time employees because it in-
tcr'l'eres with schoolwork. “You do
things for money or credit but not
botlt. l'hc money interns get is only
token."

Once a student lras secured a posi-
tion. hours cttu be discussed between
the legislator and the intern. From
then on. says Riedcl. “I would rather
the relationship be that ofemployer-
employcc. I have no intention of in-
truding on what students do down
there." He says that most students
have a brill because they do in-
terestiug work. But the wart on the
whole project. he says. isthat others.
because of their non-aggressive
tendencies. will take any job just to
bc tltere and spend all their time typ-
ing or sealing envelopes. He says.
“Students cart only blame
themselves for not liking the job.“

A second method for obtaining a
job as an intern at tltc capitol is by
contacting the assembly coordinator
tor the NY. State Internship
program. Mrs. Barbara Matula.
Over 55 colleges rtrtd universities
arotrrtd the state participate. with
S.U.N.Y.A. having the largest
rtttrnber of students enrolled. Relates
Mrs. Matrtla. “It all started 3 years
ago basically because of demand.
there were a lot of students here
walking around and no one knew
why they were here. A more formal
system was needed."

Any studcrtt who contacts Mrs.
Mrttula with a genuine interest is
guaranteed a position and a stipend
ol $|5ll part-time per semester or
$350 ltrll time pcrsemester. Upon lil-
iug the application. a student can cite
political prclerence and an area of
interest. Says Mrs. Matula.

I'hrough Barbara‘s program. two
minirnurtr demands must be met by
the legislators. I) that interns not be
used exclusively as clerical help and
go-fcrs and 2) that a legislator not
have too many interns in an ofﬁce
where one or more of those interns
are not doing important work. But

Courage interested students because
says Barbara. ‘If someone offers you
something for nothing. how do you
say no?“

Weekly optional training
seminars help to round out the in-
terns experience and provides an op-
portunity to converse with other in-
tents.

Interns who take the program for
credit one semester. frequently
return for non-credit the next. Says
Riedel. irr conclusion. “Students
learn the relevance between what
goes on in school rind what goes on
in the world. Internsltips in general
give art incentive to study what one is
all about. It is exposure to the kinds
ol problems that are raised in the
reality ol‘the real world and gives an
interpretive base with which to
learn."

In accordance with policy cs-
tablishcd by the State University
Trustees in |95l. professional facul-
ty may earn outside the university.
no tnore than 50% of their base state
salary. If the faculty member is in-
volved in rttedical research the limit
on additional earnings is 20%. These
figures tire derived after the deduc-
tion of "necessary expenses.“

The purpose of this policy. as
stated by the Trustees was to permit
and to encourage limited practice
and independent research as a means

'of attracting arid retaining quality

personnel. The limitation Was also
intended to limit a faculty members‘
outside pursuits “so as to ensure
primary attention to their faculty
responsibilities."

The latest investigation conducted
by theComptroIler‘s staff unearthed
consistent violations of the trtiktec
guidelines. For example. an
Associate Professor at the Buffan
Medical facility was earning $24.6”
annually from his state salary. Under
the guidelines. he is allowed to earn
an additional “2.307. for an annual
total of 536.920. However. his ear-
nings from other professional in-
comcs totaled more than $76,000 for
that same year. or I73% beyond the
permitted income. The university
which is responsible for illuminating
such discrepcncics. did nothing in
this instance. the auditors charge.
Similar transgressions. they add. ex-
ist at all four state supervised
medical schools. ' .

'l'rustce guidelines require staff
members to make an annual report
of all professional incomes. yet the
auditors discovered no standard
fortn to be filled out and no standard
procedure for obtaining them. The
investigation found a “less than
aggressive" attempt by individual
SUNY schools to secure and review
such information.

Upstate Medical Center. for ex?-

timple.grcquirestheirfneulty engaged ‘ . ’

in some form of private'p’rac'tice' to
submit an account of their annual
earnings. SUNY at Buffalo. on the
other hand. has a. voluntary. policy.
and at the Downstate MedicalCentéf'
when ofﬁcials of the school re- :
quested to review income records of
tire Radiology department. they
were refused access.

Proof of the failure on the part of
school officials to comply, with
trustee guidelines is evident at all the
state medical facilities. The report.
finds that at Upstate where income,
reports are mandatory. the' con-
troller's ol'liee did not have outside
irrcotne reports for a sizcahle group

‘of the institution‘s faculty

Consequently.they could “Hill
determine whether the total
professional income ' for
these individuals was within the rules
established by SUNY.

To correct theselincongrtiities the
trudilors mrrke several suggestions.
many of which appear in a similar
audit conducted in I968. The latest
aqdh" gain calls for the implementa-
tion 0 an adequate salary plan that
would not make outside income
supplementation so attractive to
medical faculty; The increased salary
would be ol't'setlby money coming
into the medical schools from out-
side patients of'medical faculty using
state medical facilities.

The auditors also call for the es-
tablishment of a central fund. All
fees and collections would be ad-
ministered from this fund and would
therefore provide a tighter. more ac-
curtrte account of money coming in
and out of the medical institutions.

It -is the controllers belief that if
these recommended measures were
to become part of the system. many
of the present problems would not
reoccur.

The State University has respond-
cd to the audit claiming. “we concur
with many of the comments in the
rrudit report. we agree that there isa
need for review of existing policies
and the plans now in effect at the
various tnedical centers."

AN OPEN LETTER TO STUDENTS

Can you imagine traveling through the Mediterranean world and
still receiving full SUNY Binghamton semester credit?

Can you believe that you can live in Malta.ltaly. and Tunis during an
entire academic year(or semester) for little more than what it would
cost you to remain on campus?

‘Well.it’s true; the SUNY-Binghamton Overseas Academic Program
in Mediterranean Studies provides just such‘an opportunity.

What's morc.studcnts majoring in Humanities including English
and Social Sciences including History receive excellent instruction.All
students in Liberal Arts are encouraged to apply.The language re-
quirements in Malta and Italy has now become optional although
students without any language background will probably want to take
some language study abroad.

Majors in Romance Languages are welcome to participate in the
Fall semester in Malta and Italy.But during the Spring Semester they
will travel to Aix-cn—Provcncc or Barcelona where they will live in
private apartments or with families depending on their preferences.

The S U N Y-Bingha mton Overseas Academic Program in Mediterra-
nean Studies is one ofthc few programs in the SUNY system that sends
students to the Islamic world.

The program is not only interdisciplinary but multi-cultural and

multi-country as well.
