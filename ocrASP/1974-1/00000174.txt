(CPsl—Despite claims that

streaking is merely fun and games.‘

police and university authorities
across the country have reacted in it
very negative manner to sneakers.

Although sneakers interviewed at
most schools expressed adesire to let
oll' steam or have fun in an absurd
manner as the reason for the streaks.
most police havetaken a bardline
approach by arresting and handcul-
ling all the streakers and bystanders
they were able to catch.

A survey of events at just 45
colleges and universities showed 94
arrests of student for streaking or
participating in the general melee
that has accompanied most streaks.
an indication that the total number
ol slfcltllcl’ arrests nationwide may
he in the hundreds.

Must ol'tllc arrests were onagrab-
hug ol local ordinance violations;
disorderly conduct. public indecen-
cy. indecent exposure. indecent
behavior. lewd behavior. and distur-
hing the peace. The largest number
ol arrests seemed to occur on the
evening of March 7. when mild
weather conditions promoted
streaking throughout the countrv.

U. of'Texas Students Demand Fee

5,000 Protest Mandatory Fee Cut By State Regents

Daily Trxun and the student govern-
ment. an estimated 5&0 students at
the University of Texas (Austin)
demonstrated against the Board of
Regents. March 20.

In an unprecedented more
characterin by students as a
'chental vendetta.“ the University
System Regents voted on March 15
to deny mandatory activity fee lun—
ding to both the sludent newspaper
and the student government.

lhc action was taken as part ofa
rcurgani/ation ol the student ser-
vices lee under a 'l'exas EdUCation
Aet amendment which gives ﬁnan-
cial relief to part-time and graduate
students “through proportionality in
the lee structure.”

Under the new lee structure the

mandatory charge will be lowered
and contributions to lhc Ti'xaii and
student government will‘appcar on
registration forms as optional
checkoll items.

lhc reorganization of the fee
structure. according to Sandy Kress.
student government president. was
:ln arbitrary mole lo "gut sludcnl
agencies that hate lutcly become
librant and challenging.“ Krcss said
the old lunding system had lully
Ctllllpllctl with the amendmcnl‘s
proportionality requirement and the
rcgcnt's action was without legal
basis.

Kress described the motion which
had been proposed by Regent Frank
C. lirwin us a "cult‘ulutcd stab" at
two organi/utlons which had at-
tacked his priorities ollen an cl'lcc-
