. ‘ “New Nixon,
- State University”

by Blob Mayor

. According to a secret memoran-
dum marked “For Eyes Only." Presi-
dent Richard M:"Nixon has been
offered the post of university presi-
dent. vacated by President
chzcdrine. The offer was made by
the Vice-President of Academic Al'-
Iitirs. Dr. Fillitup Satyric.

Reliable sources within the
SUNYA administration have in-
formed Kick tltat details of Mr. Nix-
on‘s transfer to Albany State are
presently beingworkcd out by White
House staff and SUNYA dean.
l‘riclty Dick Kennel,Kennel has
reportedly made several trips to
Washington in recent weeks to iron
out some dispute over salary and
other fringe benefits.

()ur sources claim that at present
several areas have been agreed upon
by hotlt sides. The university has,
tnadc plans to change its name to the
New Nixon State University. The
lormcr President will receive a base
salary of $4(15.ll‘)5.34 annually and
two lrce comps forall university conr
certs. In addition the state legislature
has agreetl in advance to waive all
state taxes on the President's citr-
nlngS.Mr. Nixon has recently chang-
ed his official residency from San
Clemente to San Quenton and
therefore is eligible for exemptions
on lederal tax claims.

It'it'lr-in-Ilte—ASI’ has also learned
that the President will prohibit any
disclosure of official university
material to any committees on the’
grounds that such procedure would
set a bad precedent and may damage
future~ university presidents from
making decisions without fear of

. accountability.

the President 'will have a work
load of 1 hour per week to allow him
time to finish his new book. “My
Continuing Crisis From Whittier
to Watergate." According to one
member of Salyric's staff. the Vice-
,l’rcsideut believes that Mr. Nixon
will contribute much to the universi-
'ty ttttd cttrry on the esteemed goals of
his predecessor.

Satyt‘ic also feels that the fortncr
U. S. President Would typify a long
lasting philosophy itt this university.
a philosophy that permits the
broadest interpretation of ud~
tnintstrative llexihility witltin the un-'
iversily guidelines.

Horror struck Albany State's

' ctttnpus last week when King Kong

ran atnuk between the Quadsand the
buildings on the podium. Twenty
students died of laughter and many
others ran around screaming. Kong
squashed trees and bit off sections of
Livingston 'I'owcr.

Kong created havoc when he
climbed the‘Curillon. but then drew
some cheers when he ripped the elec-
tronic equipment out and stopped
the noon chimes. 'l‘he ape was
followed as he went his destructive
way by biology students with
microscopes. photographers.

“Stop! You are trespassing!"
King Kong also caused damage
when be_tripped over the Infirmary;
he felt with his head in the Power
l'lant's smokestack. which caused
him to sneeze. which made a terrible
mess and smell and caused many
Dutclt Quad residents to go to their
l't'iends' rooms on other quads.
Security was finally able to cap

ture the lttrgc beast and retain it to
its estate in northern Westchester.
Kong is suspected of being an ex-
official in New York State govern-
ment; as he run about campus he
granted “it‘s mine -—|.built it!"

dent Benzedrine and t the. Infirmary

Ireleased a statement dcploring

Kong‘s actions. It read in part: “The
State University of New York at
Albany is a respectable and honored
iristitution. We resent the im-
plicutions of a large ape defiling the
physical aspects of the school and in-
terfering with the education ac-
tivities that are in process here.“

Student reactions were varied. .
