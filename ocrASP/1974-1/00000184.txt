vocals that anyTIimilarities arise.

With her particular. choice of
material. .she is ﬁlling a current void
in roclt music. speciﬁcally in pop

- blues. The question may “pop” up as

to whether or not that void
developed through lack of public in-
terest or lack of such a stylist after
.loplin‘s death in I970 and the release
of her Pearl album in'l97l. The fact '
that Cocker is. still around and is not
exactly enjoying the heights of pop-
ularity he had in I969 and I970
seems to favor the ﬁrst argument.

. . But Bell is a female and currently
there are no “gutsy women“ on the
pop blues circuit. She may click- if the
rock audience isn't overwhelmed
and bored by a nagging sense‘dfdiija

, vu that surrounds her music. Not
“only is there the Cocker-Joplin “

sound. but the album is loaded with

however. which rub the wrong way.
. “Yesterday‘s Music” and “We Had It
All” are. the nonentity songs of the
album. Non-entity songs have no
special endearing characteristics
and. in general. tend to be non-
descript. (Many albums suffer from
this common phenomena). The two

-. songs do have a fuzz-With guitar but

that's about all'that comes to mind.

’i Another irritation on the album is
- the

"of 'l‘inkcrbells. annoyingly lighten

intrusion 'of 'the Sweet in-

too many songs by adding un-
ydcsircable lluff where Bell might
have bccn better off overdubbing her
own voice or canning the idea of
v back-up vocals altogether. But Bell
isablc to survivcthc softy onslaught
in spite of their inclusion.

Bell does have something and on
“Queen of the Night” several things
become apparent with each listen-
ing. Maggie Bell has the ability to
transcend the Cooker-Joplin tag
whether or not she gains popularity
by fulﬁlling that image. She can do
more with her voice than she cares to
on most of the cuts. It is up to her
and her artists-and-repetoirc man to
find material like “The Other Side“
and "l‘rn‘dewin‘ds" ' through which
she as an expressive and unique ar-
tist can emerge.

Ivan Stcen. another teacher from

that his collcitgucs couldn‘t honestly

this “leaves open the possibility for

that the procedures could use some

alterations. ‘

lisnctly why the two teaching
awards exist is subject to personal in-
terpretation. Some may feel 'as
Solnick does that the “whole thing is
nssinine in that it has littlctodowith'
teaching." Or as Johnpoll expressed
along similar lines. “this is net what
teaching is for. teaching isn't a pop-
ularity contest. teaching is ~
something entirely different.“ Alex-
ander on the other hand sees
usefulness in the awards. “they‘rcan
attempt to recognize the importance
of teaching.“ He added. "I submit
that the cause and effect relationship
is less than first hoped but at least it
has meant teacher recognition.“

When Hclcn llorowitl. was asked
whether she thought the awards were
an incentive for tcllchcrs to work
harder she-replied. "I'm not so sure
it‘s an inccnlivc. for a really good
teacher is eager and anxious to tcllch

the really good teacher is doing it
for the love of teaching.“ Horowitz.
added in it sorrowful tone. "Unfor—
