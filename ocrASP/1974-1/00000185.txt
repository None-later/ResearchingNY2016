“When you start off with on
absolute powerhouse after com-
ing 00' indoor season," says
Albany State track coach R.
Keith Munsey. "it‘s kind of dis-
heartening to see it wither away
before your eyes.“

'l'hc'track team started off the
season with Si men. which was
the best turnout the sport has
ever had here. Among them Were
the top performers from the in-
door scason just completed. and
many of the leading men from
last year‘s spring team. The team

was stacked in many events.
“Our mile relay team. for in:
stance.“ says Munsey, “Would
have gone undefeated this year
I‘m sure.“

At last estimate, however. the

squad numbers around 60 men. ,

and many of those lost have been
key figures. Gone are Tim
Bilash. the team‘s best 440 and
880 yard runner this indoor
scttson. Dave'Cole. its number
one high-hurdlcr. and Tom Par-
dini. its most consistent longand
triple jumper.

. What most cmbitters Munsey.
however. is that the number
remainingon the squad can not

really be known exactly, since

many men have signed up for the
team. received physicalssigned
out equipment. and then rarely

. been seen again. “There‘s one
‘ guy‘who I haven't seen for three

weeks." says the coach. “yet he'll
come down some day soon and
expect to be in a time trial. The
heck with him."

The situation has been
building since last year. when
even captains. on the team. were
missing practices to play in-
tramural softball games. This
year. however. according to
Munsey. is worse still. “I‘m very
disgusted." says Munscy. “with
the attitude of a sizable number
of people this year. We base our
prospects on the men who sign
out equipment. and now we must
draw up completely different
line-ups because many of these
people have never even
attempted to make practice. -

“I do understand that one or
two cases have had problems
with their studies, but there have
only been two men who have had
the guts or common decency to
call me and say. ‘coach. I have to
quit.‘ “

It is il new attitude which has
bothered Munscy the most. He
remembers it time when the work
cthic was stronger with pcoplc.
Muybc. at times. it became too
strong. but it is not a Nazi-
liuhrcr relationship which

 

Munsey is advocating. “There

_ shouldn't boa legal commitment ’g
to any sport. People havethe

right-to do what they wish. but)
the kids here only know what
they have a right to do. They
don‘t understand. or don't care
to understand. that when they
commit themselves. they should
have some obligation to fulﬁll
that commitment

The outlook for the team.
despite these obvious problems,
is still fairly good. “We'll be up
there again in the SUNY con-
ference. although a few weeks
ago I would have said that
nobody could even touch us.“
says Munscy. Coming back in
the shot put is defending SUNY
champion Rudy Vido. and he
will be hacked by Paul Gutman.
.lim Holloway. and Tom Clcary.
Clcztry. just a freshman. will also

It may be that because track is
comprised almost entirely of in-
dividual performances. that a
different attitude can be seen in
this sport. as opposed to the team
sports of football and basketball.
Within these squads. What hurts
one hurts all, and peer pressure
can usually check any tendencies
toward unyonc missing practice
or becoming a primu donna.

Track. howcvcr. above all.
remains an individual ci't'ort.ttnd
ctrch mun more casin says to
himself. “What's right for me is
right for the team." In this case.
the condition has gone so far that
men arc saying. “The heel; with
what lsigncd. Ijustdon‘t want It)
go." There are reasons for this ill-
titudc. but there are also no cx-
cuscs for it. In Munscy‘s words.
“'l'hcsc people have the vote at
Ill. so why don‘t they start acting
like adults."
