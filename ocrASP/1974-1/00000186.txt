basic Ideas 'of lacrosse: have
remained the same; by‘using his
stick. the lacrossevpalyer takes

either carrying or throwing it and
opponent's goal.

Lacrosse attracts a unique
breed of‘ individual. its par-
ticipants unknowingly. almost
magically become dedicated to a
sport heretofore unheard of.
This intrinsic quality of lacrosse.
more so than any other sport.
leads young athletes to new
heights of achievement. '

Few athletic events known to
man require such a combination
of skills as does lacrosse.

Artie‘s race came after the first
regular race. l was feeling pretty
good. as my place bet in the first
race came in for a 4.20 return.
Most of the harness racing club
and Artie‘s friends were crowded
around the finish line. waiting

for the race to start.

Artie was in the fourth or last
position and as he came around
the first time. he was last. But lre
would come on. He crossed over
to the rail. before the turn. to
park driver three. who had the
best horse in the race. Artie was
still lost going into the
backstrctch. Along the
backstrctch. horse one and two
came off the rail and Mr.
Finkclbcrg took his horse and
boldly squeezed through, along
the rail.to take the [end he was
not to relinquish. The harness
racing club was in hysterics.

Artie bad a two length lead at
the top of the stretch but driver
three was coming on. Artie
maintained this lead. as he gave
the horse the whip and held off
three at the wire for the victory.
After crossing the finish line. Ar~
tte wuved his whip in triumph
and perhaps in rclicftlrat the race
was over.

The response from the harness
ructng‘ club was incredible as
everyone was going crazy. After
Artie returned to the winner‘s
ctrclc he was met by his parents
and a mob of admiring fans.

Artie. completely covered with
mud from the track but certainly
Jubilant. talked after the race. “It
was a two horse racerswhen it
came to the stretch. I realized I
had a shot and I gave it the
wlup.“ Naturally Artie was a bit
after his
horsc acted up in the paddock
but he got through his first test
on what he hopes will be u long

lcgislutivc interference.

the first official policy on the
collection of student fees was '5-
tublislrcd by the State llonrd of
lrustecs on November of l9tr7. l'lrc
guidelines approved officially the
university‘s sanction for collecting
roluntory l'ccs.

Until the November decision was
outlined. most students bclicvcd fees
were rrrundntory. Colfcctcd by com-
pus l‘ucully Student Associations.
the fees appeared on student bills
each semester. llrc FSAs then
deposited these funds in their own
nccounts in order to cxcmpl these
funds from rcgulrtr stutc accounting
procedure. It wns believed these fees
were going to be used exclusively for
student govcrnrrrents and extra-
curricrrlur student activities on the
individqu campuses. An audit by
the Strife Controller issued in llttrb
suggested this was not occuring.

Members of ACT stressed that the
evaluations will be used for student
information only; but. a recent
report of President Benezet‘s Ad
Hoc Advisory Committeeon Tenure
suggested that evaluations for tenure
should be conducted by students. in-
stead of the departments as they are
now. This is only arcport. however.

'l‘wcnty questions ranging from
the lecturing ability of the teacherto
the teacher‘s encouragement of stu-
dent ideas are asked in the question-
naire written by llill Rehfuss. and
based on models from Harpur. Cor-
rrcll. Stony Brook ntrd other schools.

The booklet will include each
student‘s response rated from A
through I) on some questions . A
through E on others. Questions will
also be averaged on at weighted basis.

Opponents of the evaluation say it
is "just another form." hinting it will
be useless if not harmful.

()thcrs say students life not
qualified to evaluate tcnchcrs. Still
others feel at standard form for nip
dcprrrtrrrcnts is meaningless.

llut workers answer these charges
saying pcrlrups someday this starr-
dnrdi/cd form will be used in con-
junction with n shorter departmental
form. Rclrl'uss said “it‘s general
crrottglr to hit everyone. btrt specific
