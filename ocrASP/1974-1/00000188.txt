Johnson

Ed. Note

Due to confusion in the Student
Association petitioning procedures.
possible Presidential candidate Tim
Johnson filed his form for what he
believed was the SA Presidential
form. The form was entirely
legitimate. complete with the one
hundred signatures. All Would have
been satisfactory were it not for the
fact that candidate Johnson filed a
petition for SASU dclcgatc. con-
l'usingit it scents for the Presidential
form.

llt'inging his problem to the notice
of President Steve (icrbcr. on Tues-
tltty. just thrccduysago. it was dccid-
cd that Johnson not he allowed to
switch his campaign to the l’t'csidcn-
cy.

Ihc mnltct‘. brought before Cen—
lrttl Council chttcsday‘nighl. was
resolved in the some manner. The
opinion was that there could be no
nay tll determining if the one hun—
dred signatures collected by Johnson
llll' SASU were done with tile
knowledge that lie was intcttt on run-
ning for the Presidency.

Johnson admitted that he was the
Helm ul lltt “unfamiliarity of
procedure.“ which led to his being
plttccd on the bullet for the wrong
post.

Johnson's only recourse now is to
thc Sttpt'cittc('ottt'l. bill it isdoubtl'ul
whether there is enough little
remaining lot the Court to prepare
and tlccttlc his case in time for the
elections on lttcsdtty.

Thomas

Sam Thomas. slowed down a bit
by the petition proceedure. has
become an SA presidential can-
didate to get a point across concer-
ning mandatory student tax.

Thomas has a lot of experience
with SA—in court. It seems that
when he became aware of exactly
where his tax dollar was going. he
didn‘t agree. Ho feelsthat ifASPhas
an editorial page and Central Coun-
cil can meddle in politics. hecould be

 

supporting groups he has no
to. or might be against.

'l’homas feels that the individual
students. here for the academics
SUNYA provides should not be
forced to support all groups on cant-
pus. So he battled in small claims
court for a refund of his $64. The
case was thrown out ofcourt due to a

Rudolph K.» Chiu chooses to
center his campaign around harsh
criticism of the present administra-

term is gun control. In other words.
his administration may well be
qualified to be called it 'onc issue ad-
