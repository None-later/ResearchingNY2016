The Student Assembly. which sets
the policies of S‘ASU. includes at
least one full-time delegate. plus one

from each school. The Assembly has
a lobby in the State Legislature
which concerns itself with areas that
affect students is their capacities as
students: e.g.. higher education.
financial aid. governance. student
rights. and voting right. The full-
time staff includes a legislativedirec-

SASU also provides services to

“purchase power“; that is. he can get
discounts on largeappliances. travel

of the Board to the Alumni Associa-

the correct addresses of alumni:
producing newsletters relating to

Class Councillor wishes to share
responsibility with other classmates.
this is done through a Class Board.

all elections were held iii‘the Carn-

pus Center. Now. for‘ example. a
student living in Alumni Quad this
year will be able to vote in Alumni
Quad for representation in Indian
Quad. where hewill be living next
year. A resident student must vote
for representation in the quad in
which he will be living next year;
commuter students should vote in
the Campus Center.

2. Sample ballots must be dis-
tributed prior to an election.

3. Persons attempting to vote
more than once in an election will
be penalized.

4. Candidates may not represent
living areas in which they _do not
reside.

It would have stipulated that
Senate elections and replacement
elections for Central Council
members be held at the end of the
spring semester. Presently. ahof the
Council members. all Senators. and
S.A. President and Vice-President.
are elected in the spring. with
another - of the Central Council
members elected in September.

The term of office for SA. Presi-
dent and Vice-President and Central
Council members runs for one year
from May IS. The proposal was
dcsigncd to encourage more
freshman to vote. The Committee
thought that it would receive better
election returns because voters
would know more people in their liv-
ing areas by November or
December.

U
The recently introduced Staf-
fo'rd/ Anderson Proposal/on student
ﬁnancial aid has received the prompt
approval of the Senate and the Tui-
tion Assistance Program‘ (TAP).
sponsored by Peter J. Costigan(R.-
Setauket). has passed the Assembly.
It is now expected that the leadership
of both houses will begin
negotiations to develops a com-
promise vcrsion of the two bills.

In this year. which promises a
significant change in financial
assistance for students. the Staf-
ford / Anderson Proposal (S. 9550) is
most comprehensive in nature. The
69-page bill. sponsored by Senator
Ronald B. Stafford (R-Plattsburgh)
who chairs the Senate Higher
Education Committee. Senate Ma—
jority Leader Warren M. Anderson
(R-Binghamton). Senate Minority
Leader Joseph anetsky (DL-
Manhattan). and over 30 other
Senators. rewrites practically every
section of the State Education Law
related to student financial aid. The
two—part proposal is the result of the
diligent efforts of" the Senate Higher
Education Committee staff under
the supervision of its Executivo
Director. Roger Noyes: If im-
plcmcntcd. S. 9550 will be by far the
most sophisticated state program for
awarding student ﬁnancial aid in the
country.

The Stufl'ord/ Andcrson Proposal
would be phnscd-in in two pnrtsz‘

|. an interim year program
lllttl would increase prcscnt Scholar
lnccntivc awards dcsigncd‘to mcct
the immediate list:le needs of-
students in I974-75.

2. the creation of the New
York Stutc Higher Education Scr-
\'tccs Corporation (l‘IESC) which
would become operational in I975.
Ill-ZSC would be responsible for the
administration and coordination of
it“ New York State financial aid and
guaranteed loan programs.

Interim Year 1974-75

During the interim year. which
would require an additional ap-
propriation of $38 million over pre-
sent programs. S3550 proposes to
increase Scholar lnccntivc awards
Irom the present $600 maximum to
$700 for students in public colleges
nnd Stiltlt) for students at private
colleges. Furthermore. the awards
would be determined ntorc equitably
by the introduction of a sliding
schedule of nwnrds whereby the

 

   
    
 

ly as the family income ‘rise's.
Therefore a SUNY student with a
family income of 55000 who is a
recipient of Scholar Incentivewould
receive 5400 rather than the present
$300 award. The Regents
Scholarship awards would be kept
intact at present levels. which means
that under the combined programs
the same SUNY student‘s'entire tui-
tion would be paid for.

Other highlights of the bill would
remove the requirement that the
Scholar Incentive recipient pay the
initial $200 of tuition. It would also
keep the present multi-student in
family formula and it would not im-
pose an award differential between
upper and lower division students.
Both these measures were the sub-
jects of controversy under the
original TAP proposal (for detail see
SASU Legislative Report. Vol. 2
No. 3. March 8. I974). Under the
Senate proposal no SUNY student
would be burdened with decreased
awards. and the revised awards
would apply to all students who will
be enrolled after June I. l974—not
just Freshmen.

Probably the most innovative
provision in the interim program is
the clarification of present financial
emancipation statutes which would
allow students who are ﬁnancially
indcpcndcnt of" their parents to
receive awards determined by their
own income. However. SASU will
be proposing amendments to some
specific.rcquircmcntsin the defini-
tion.o_l'. financial independence.

SASU will also recommend that
the interim program bc extended to
two years to allow for thorough
dcvclopcmcnt. publication and in-
put into the administration of limiti-
cinl hid under IIESC.

Awards under all programs would
be determined by. a complicated
needs analysis system which would
take into consideration the income
and other available resources
(assets) of the individual student and
parents. a reasonable expected 'con-
tribution from that income and
other resources. the' speciﬁc expense
budget required to attend the
student's particular institution in-
cluding tuition. fees. room. board
and general maintenance. an accep-
tublc budget level that would es-
tablish the limits of the annual cost
in which the State would share. and
the estimated amount of non-slate
aid available. The approved budget
level. the estimated non-state aid.
and the expected contribution from
income and other resources are com-
puted to dcterminc'that percentage
of' student nced thutlhe State would

be responsible for. These percen-.

tnch will bcdctcrmincd each year by
the HESC Board of Trustees in ac-

cordance with the amount of money .

appropriated by the Legislature for
the programs.
SASU Proposes Amendments
Until these schedules. regulations
and percentages are determined by

  

any income level. (It should be
noted. however. that the proposal in-

      

cludes a “save harmless" provision ‘

so'that students who received aid un-
der present programs before July 1.
I975 will receive awards under the
present or the new- programs.
whichever is greater.) Once es-

tablished. these factors will be sub--

ject to change every year. depending
upon the amount of funding by the
Legislature.

At a time when Congress is in the
process of eliminating the recently
enacted federal "needs test” on
guaranteed student loans because it
has greatly decreased the number of
approved loans. SASU believes it is

unfair to apply a similar needs test at '
the State level. For this reason. and ‘

because a rigorous needs analysis
system for grant programs will in-
crease the need for a flexible loan
program. SASU has also proposed
that S. 9550 beamendcd to eliminate
the needs test on guaranteed student
loans. ' 
In regard to the determination of?
income and other available
resources in computing award:
schedules. SASU believes it is un-
reasonable to expect parents to con-

system on then ardso _ ' ut .' ”
any sector of higher education of st‘

   

 
 
 

   

   

assets to include only ine'o',
producing property such as side
bonds and other investments. .

SASU will seek to amends 
of the bill that would prohibit use  .
monies-for educational opportunity .
programs (SEEK. EOP.,HEOP) for
supplementary financial assistance
for books and necessary
maintenance. .Assumedly. these
students would be eligible for pay-‘
merit of these costs under the general
entitlement program. but SASU ‘
believes that the benel'itsof these op-
portunity programs should be con-
tinued in distinct form within the
framework of the new aid system
rather than being lumped in with the
funds for the other programsmgp

SASU will also propose more
technical amendments to. the
proposal‘s method of defining and
proving the student's ﬁnancial in-
dependence from his or her parents.
Likewise. SASU will seek to amend
the hill to extend eligibility under the
various aid programs in the proposal 1
i“. five years for students in
educational opportunity programs
as well as stpdents who graduate
from two-year colleges and transfer
tp four-year colleges.
