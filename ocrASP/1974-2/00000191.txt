Robert Redford. who easily
adapts the smile of “eternal
assurance“. is an appropriate Jay
Gatsby. Unfortunately. a poor and
inflexible screenplay renders his
character overly reticent and
pondcrous. The constant phrase
“old sport“ grows'on one‘s nerves
even if its ample usage in the novel
did not seem to.

delineated in the originalteitt. but is
free to capture the character‘s cs—
settce in her own style. She doesso in
ii befitting drone of a voice. while
cheating in everything from a golf
game to a friendship and thinking
nothing of it in the process. Though
tt comparatively minor role. her
tcmcrity plays up Daisy‘s fragility as
well on screen as in print.

“The Great Gatsby“ exhibits a lot

'of silly sentimentality which

provokes an occasional chuckle
where none is intended. Gatsby and
Daisyull toool'ten trade unbearably
loirg love-struckstarcsat each other
which are broken up by comparable
shots of goldfish swimming in a
pool. Fit/gerald‘s gift of depicting
shallow di‘caminess in a rich, lucid
manner is so overlooked that the
film is actually it parody of the novel.

It is the opinion of these writers
that yoti stay home tonight. turn on
your reading lamp. and enjoy a truly
great Gatsby.
