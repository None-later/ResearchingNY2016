,I‘SLRCEOITU albums are supposedly .

‘ meant to be entertaining. But they
lose this capacity when they become

_ it” source of frustration. Barry
Goldberg comes dangerously close
(to this with his Atco release.‘Barr_v
.ﬁoldberg (SD 7040).

t For all the positive aspects of the
album. there seem to be just as many
negative ones and maybe even more.
With his experience playing
keyboards in Charlie Musselwhite‘s
Chicago Blues Band in the mid-
sixties. and in the short-lived Electric
Flag. and on the lirst Mike
Bliiomlield-Al Koopcr Super Ses~
sion. as well as on an album of his
own. Goldberg might have had a
dynatnitc album in the works.

In addition. .lcrry Wexlerand Bob
Dylan produced this new package
and Dylan very noticeably con-
tributes his lung power for back-up

'vocals on four songs. As il~ this

even the decent ones have their
weaker moments While some of the
hammers have an occasional
brilliant sparkle.

Maybe Goldberg needed side one
towurm up. Here his voeals basically
luck emotion as it" he was afraid to let
go. Ur else they suffer from being
forced and strained.‘ His contrived
rel‘drences in “Silver Moon" to the
guiding assistance of constellations
("Diana the huntrcss leads mean my
way.the ﬂeet-footed Mercury speeds
me home today. Orion the strong—
ltc helps me along. the Gemini twins
sing me a song") hardly seem l‘clt
next to his recounting of cops who
planted a joint on him in order to
bust him on the fiddle and banjo
vehicle ‘Orange County Bus."

Another disturbing tactor is that
his vocals are sometimes submerged
penneth the instruments so that

"\Vt'i’rds become indistinguishable. If

these are anything like Gemini twins

Becket. David .Hood. and Roger I Jingingil 5""8‘ “10" milth “‘6 IUCK-

Hawkins are included as personnel “ '

along with a number oiotherequally
talented musicians and (on two
songs) a sharp female back'up trio.
So the big question is: What went
wrong? «

It seems the quality ol'thealhum is
split in halt 4 out of 5 songs on the
ﬁrst side are disappointing or an-
noying. and 4 oitt ol' 5 songs on side
tWo are OK and Cicli impressive. But

main emphasis on lyrics. producers
shouldn‘t try to hide ihcvoice at the

has been as restricted in perlormancc

no voice. no continuity in lyric
