FRIDAY, APRIL 19, 1974

 

h U.S.' Supreme Court has up-

held th‘ constittitionslity of a Belle
Ter e Y. zoning ordinance which
allows the village authorities to
restrict the number of unrelated
studentsliving' together in a single
dWelling. g I '
 The . ordinance prohibits more
than tWo unrelated persons from liv-
ing' in a one family dwelling. The
speciﬁc action under question was
against six unrelated students who
were living in a rented house in the
village. which is near the Stony
Brook campus Long Island.

In a 7 to 2decision. the court ruled
that the enaction of the zoning law
was within the bounds of a village‘s
authority. Justice William 0.
Douglas wrote the majority opinion
for the court, which made it the ﬁrst
venture of the Supreme Court into
housing into local zoning laws in
nearly 50 years.

The ruling is expected to have a
significant impact on the students
and college communities across the
nation. as many university areas
have zoning ordinances similar to
Belle Tcrre‘s.

The case had been brought to US

.District Court in I972by three

students from the State U niversity at
Stony Brook. NY. and their
landlord. requesting that the Belle
'l'erre ordinance be declared un-
constitutional. The three students
had been servcd with a summons for
violating the ordinance. The District
Court ruled in September I972 that
the town had a lawful interest in
maintaining the “marriage and
blood related“ character of the
neighborhood and could do so
through zoning.

A Second Circuit Court of
Appeals overturned the latter deci-
sion in February I973 noting that in-
habitants of a neighborhood and city
officials “cannot under the mask of
zoning ordinances impose social
preferences upon their fellow
citizens."

l'hose who favor the Belle Terre
type of ordinance usually have cited
the physical deterioration of
neighborhoods and homes occupied
by an excessive number of residents.

The case was presented to the

 

Court on behalf of the village-by -'

Village Counsel Bernard Gegan.

who argued that the law is aimed at I,

retaining a traditional single-fainin

character in the community. Density , '

control. community stability. and
rent control were also claimed goals
of the ordinance. It was admitted by
Gegan in his ' February court
appearanccthat the law was primari-
ly aimed at students. but heargued it
was not discriminatory.

Lawrence Sager. a New York Civil
Liberties Union attorney who
handled the case for the students.
said that he was disappointed by the
high court‘s decision. In his argu-
ment before the court. he had said
that the village ordinance was “at
drastic odds with the fourteenth
amendtncnt‘s concept of personal
liberty and restraint upon state ac-
'tion."

Sources close to Sager incorrectly
predicted that Justice Douglas.
'l‘hurgood Marshall. and William
Brccnn would decide in favor of the
students. While Marshall and Bren-
nan wrote dissenting opinions.

supmne ('ourt mm William 0.  '

Douglas voted with the majority.
Brennan dissented from the ma-
jority opinion because he felt that the
appeal was based on a moot ques-
tion. since the students no longer liv-
ed in the hOUsc. Marshall main-
tained that the lirst and fourteenth
amendments gave citizens the right
to choose their political and social
ordinances. and that. therefore. the

ordinance was uncongtitutional.

Belle ‘l'erre Mayor James Philbin
is on record as being extremely
pleased with the decision. *‘This is
what we always felt was the case.”
l'hilhin said. “That is. the village‘s
right to be self-discriminating and
‘muitttaining the traditional family-
whatcver that is.“

Student Unrest Surfacing On SUNY Campuses

by Al Senia (SASU)

Student demonstrations and sit-
ins at tltc State University College at
New l’altz have subsided for the pre-
sent with apparent student victories
in several campus governance
matters. but student unrest over
similar issues has spread to a second
S UNY ‘camptts-lhc State
Agricultural and Technical College
at Morrisville.

Student dissatisfaction with catn-
pus inl'irmary operations.
meanwhile. has flared at SUNY-
Stony Brook and SUNY-littflttlo-

As students ended a week-long oe-
cuptttion of the administration
building at New l’altz. their counter-
parts at Morrisville launched an cf—
l'ort to increase student participation
itt many aspects of campus life.
Three hundred students
demonstrated peacefully on April 3.
presented a list of grievances to the
campus administration. and begun a
series of negotiations with the cunt-
pus President. the Vice President.
the local college council anti the
Dean of Education.

Negotiating sessions between a
small group ol student leaders and
eantpus administrators continued
throughout the week and various
campus rallies were held to appraise
students of the status of tltc
negotiations. there are some 2.500
students on the campus.

‘l'ltc major issues in the student
protest involve reform of the campus
Faculty Student Association and in-

stilttliott of a 24-hour intervisitation
policy in campus dormitories.

Newly elected student government
president Dave Burgess says there
are n number of secondary issues
lttcling the protest actions. These in-
elude:

-A lack ol adequate student par-
ticipation in the hiring uttd firittg of
luculty members.

-A dcmand lor consistent evalua-
tion by students of faculty perfor-
malice

-l'hc removal of the Dean of
Students.

-Rcl'orm ol campus infirmary
operations.

-An inadequate campus
bookstore.

- l'hc poor quality of campus
meals ttllti the lack ol'u cumpusdicti-
cum.

Burgess indicated that some
progress had been made by the end
ol the nch on institution of the
\isttutton policy and I‘SA reform.
httt he added that tltcadministration
has rclusctl to reply specifically to
man) ol the student demands.

Some ol the impetus for the stu-
dent protest. llurgcss added. may
huts come ttotu pt‘olcst actions at
51 t -\L'\\ |’:t|t/. “lhc mstigators of
the protest hcrc knew about the New
l'ull/ action and wanted to show
some support lot it." he said.
"Anyone who Lttotts about it here
supports it."

demonstrators said throughout their
week of protest activity that they
hoped similar actions would spread
to other SUNY campuses and spark
a new wave of student concern with
the quality of campus life.

At New I’altz. tltc week long ad-
ministration buildiug sit-in ended at
students were assured they would
have a stronger voice in determining
how the college should be run. Two
new advisory committees dealing
with overall edttcational goals and
the granting of faculty tenure have
been cslnhlishcd by College Presi-
dent Stanley Coffmnn. and a pop-
ular philosophy professor. denied
appointment because of his age. has
been rebired on a part-time basis.

In a letter distributed to the cam-
pus comntttnity last week. Coffman
said he supported retuinmcut of the
campus experimental studies
program and indicated he would
support a student rttn food service.
as long as the campus Faculty Stu«
dcnt Association was involved itt the
operation.

Additionally. the College
Assembly. main academic gover-
nance body at New I’ultz. passed a
resolution at the urgingol its student
members that calls on President
Coffman to respect Assembly
decisions as representing the entire
university cotninunity and urges him

to accept Assembly decisionsas hav-
ing the ".utmost importance" in
policy decisions.

During the week of protest.
students had charged that some elc-
tncnt of the faculty ignored
Assembly decisions and that the
New l’ultl. administration tacitly
supported the boycott.

In unrelated protest activity.
angry SUNY Stony Brook students
held college l’residcnt .lohn 'l'oll cap-
