attempting to convince the grand
jury to indict a few guards.

The Attica legal defense team can-
tends thiit prosecutors simply want
"A few token. guards indicted so that
the grand jury investigation will
appear to be a fair one.“ The defense
team charges that the first jury was
so biased against the inmates that it
indicted only prisoners. despite the
pleading of prosecutors. Now. says
the Attica defense group. a newjury
is being selected to indict a few
gtiards. thereby making thcenlire in-

A controversy ensued when the

r... Whom The Bell Tolls

Phones I'ang frantically in stodcnt newspaper ofﬁces across the state this week as word spread
that the bill had cleared the Senate Higher Education Committee and was on its way to the

Senate floor. I

State Senatordohn Marchi. a Republican Conservative from Staten Island sponsored a bill
that would prohibit the use of student activity fees to help finance student publications on state-
operaled campuses. l’urportcdly to “picilecl” students from the “many” incidents ol‘obscenity ‘
libel and “unacceptable” political. moral and social views. the bill would spell thedeath of many

state school papers and severely cripple those few managing to survive.

Mr. Marchi's apparent concern for the rights of students seems admirable. but his true
motivations .qu'esllonable. For one who claims to be working for the rights of students. action
that would eliminate the existence of the student press is hardly consistent. Beneath the bill‘s

benevolent veneer lies a blatant attempt at censorship aIid oppression.

llie valuc'ol the campus newspaper is inestiniable in terms of the broad range of services it
provides. It Is the sounding board for issues; it is a calendar of events; it is the core of com-
munications. lhc campus newspaper provides educational experience for those involved in its

production. as well as those others who participate in the politics of its pages.

It is unfortunate that so many college papers must rely upon mandatory student funds for their
survival.Yet we are sure that students would Iiiueh rather have to pay a little for their publication
rather than to have no paper ltl all. We are sure. as well. that the students would support if
newspaper that is free of censorship and oppression. rather than a do-nolhing rag that months

Mr. Marclii s proposal supposes that the student in our lJiiivcrsityliiive no brains. no sense of
decency or responsibility Apparently he does not think as capable of self-restraint and good

judgement. l'hiil is it tragic misconception.

the bill is currently being held back while the school singled out for Its particuliirol'fense is try-

ing to “work things out.“ Mr. Murclii has agreed to kill the bill if he is tisl'ied with the awaited
report. I he campus press should llicn be able loresunienormaloperations: that is. until the nexl

Discount'Fare

s Threatened

 

WASI’IINGI‘ON- Discount fares offered by
some air. rail and bus lines to youths. senior
citizens and the handicapped may be a thing of
the past unless llie House Committee on In-
terstate and Foreign Commerce moves soon
to act on legislalion already passed un-
animously by the Senate.
the Senate proposal. authored by Sen.
Warren (E. Magnuson (l)-Wash.) powerful
chairman of the Commerce Committee. came
last year in response to a ruling by the Civil
Aeronautics Board that prohibits air carriers
from ollering discount rates on either stand-
by or reservation basis. ‘I‘hat ruling is
‘sclltltllllctl to take effect .Iune |.jusl a few short
weeks away. and although the matter is on the
House committee‘s agenda. no hearing date
has been set.
ides lo Rep. Marley 0. Sluggers (D. W.
and Rep. John .larmon (l)-Okln.).
e iirmcn respectively of the full committee
il..tl its Subcommittee on Transportation and
Aeronautics. assure me that both men are
committed to holding hearings as soon as
possible this session.
I lie problem is that the committee is
presently bogged down trying to iron out
enei ,y crisis legislation. and in addition is fac-
ed Willi at least two more weeks of hearings on
‘lour key transportation measures. Taking
into account the upcoming April recess. it will
be an least the third week in May before the
committee could turn its attention to discount
‘Iurcs.
0n the surface Ilic issue does not seem to be
a highly controversial one. More than I70
.House members have sponsored or co-
sponsored discount l'are legislation of one '
kind or another. Almostalloflhosc proposals
authorize and encourage (but do not order)
air and surface carriers to oll‘cr lower rates to
youths (persons under 22). the elderly (65 and
over) and the handicapped. leaving the
percentage of the discounts and other
lvariables up to the carriers. .
The energy crisis. although it has apparently
delayed House hearing on the matter. but in
fact provided It plus to proponents ofditeount

lures who poiiil Io juiiibojels llyingal half or .

less than hiIlI capacity. “It‘s a terrible waste.“
says .lniiie (iroverman of the National Student
'l.obby‘s legislative stall. “Youngerand older
persons rarely fly because many of them live
on low fixed incomes and can‘t afford full air
fares. And so they opt for what they can af-
lord. automobiles. \ihicli in turn adds to the
gas shortage problem. while planes are llying
hull-empty all the time."

NSI. has been perhaps Washington‘s Iiiost
active organization working for passage of
discount tare legislation. The American
Association tll Retired Persons and other
organi/atioiis representing the young and the
old haie ioiced approval ol'disconnl fares.
but by most accounts lli|\ e not placed the issue
high on their list iil priorities. Theirlack ofac-
tioii. needless to say. has done nothing to
speed tip the Ilouse Committee.

indeed. one committee aide told me that if
students and senior citizens really want dis-
count lures. they had better let the committee
know it. He said committee mail on the subject
to date has been light. However. aides to both
Sluggers and .larmon indicated to me they had
been receiving considerable mail in support of
discount fares. bolli from within and without
their districts. In fact. it was in part pressure
from Staggers‘ West Virginia constituents that
led him to introduce his own version ol'lhc dis-
count titre proposal. which would. in Sluggers‘
words. “allow each airline to decide for itself
what it wants to do."'l'hat is basically the
thrust of Ilie Senate bill. .larmon. although he
has not taken a position on thcissuc so far. is
likely to go tilting with the rest of the corn-
niillee. Two other committee members. ltcp.
lhiii Kuykendall (It-Tenn.) and Rep. Bertram

I’odell (l)—N.Y.). have sponsored discount

legislation.
But all of this will be to ‘no avail unless we
