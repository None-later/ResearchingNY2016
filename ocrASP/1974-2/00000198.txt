becoming increasingly irregular and

undepend'lble as well its expensive.

First Class postage has risen nearly r
70% in the last five years while ser-

vice has steadily deteriorated.

Item ll: After New‘ York City
bought (the "subway system the fare.
increased 100'per. .cent in IS years
While the quality of servicediminish-
ed and the Transit Authority lost
money and continues to do so.

In the case of the Postal Service,
the system is under “public‘f (State) '
control and private enterprise is not
allowed to compete for the delivery
of lst class mail. IPSA however. a
private profit— making postal

system. delivers in seven states 2nd

class mail at $25 per l000 pieces
compared to the Postal Service‘s
price of $44 per l000 pieces (as of
I969). And II’SA makes a profit
while the Postal Service loses
money.

The subways. while under private
ownership, maintained their fare at
So for 36 years prior to the city's
takeover in spite of a 32% rise in
wholesale prices.

item III: The Tennessee Valley
Authority. the government-owned
power company. cost American tax-
payers over 2 billion dollars in sub-
sidies its first 26 years in existence.
yet power from TVA is more expen-
sivc than that available from‘any
privately owned power company in
‘America.

On the other hand. the SUNYA
bookstore. once a paragon of inef-
Iiciency and poor service. was put
under private profit-making control
and long book lines and shoddy ser-
vice became a thing of the past.

The fact is that virtually every scr-
vicc under government control or
ownership suffers from inefficiency.
waste and an amazing ability to con-
sistently lose the taxpayer‘s money.
A private company. on the other
hand. because it is a profit-making
venture. attempts to provide
economy. efficiency and good ser-

vice. If it does not its business‘will be
lost to a competing company which

provides better. more economical

service. A government operation
however. with no incentive for ef-
ficiency. just gets. more heavily into
debt. and the taxpayers end up sup—
porting inefﬁciency with ever greater
subsidies.

The solution therefore. is to get
the government out of running
businesses which could be managed
better under pure capitalism. as re-

.cent history proves that nearly

everything the State tries to manage.
control or regulate turns into a
hopeless bureaucratic mess.

The big question has been: how
exactly can private enterprise take
over the functions which the state
has been incptly operating for so
long'.’ Well. a booklet by Jarret
qulstein called Pub/iv Servies Un-
rlcr Luirrcz Fairy explains not only
why the government must get out of
dispensing so-called “public ser-
Vices" but also how private enter-
prise could take over and do a much
more economic and efficient job of
it. Wollstcin explains how laissel-
faire capitalism could run utilities.
education. charity. the phone
system. fire departments. the postal
system and the roads.

Let its take a look at roads. for in-
stance. Why not sell the highways to
private interests? There are those
who have a vested interest in seeing
that long. well—maintained highways
are available and accessible. These
would include the oil companies.
steel manufacturers and automobile
makers. Though the cost of building
and maintaining highways is. of
course. enormous. there are many
firms who could afford the price. In
I967 there were 104 corporations
with total sales over one billion
dollars. Many of these enterprises
are those with direct interests in sec-
ing that a well-kept network of
highways exists.

Many of the highways would be
toll roads. as they are now. while
another way for highway ownership
to be profitable would be to make
them a co-operative venture among
a chain of motels. restaurants. and
service stations. Costs to drivers

would not necessarily be much
higher than now. as the highway
owners must not kill the user‘s incen-
tive to travel by auto. If highway
tolls are prohibitively eiipensive.
other road builders. as well as train
and'airplane industries. would fulfill
the demand for lower cost transpor-
tution.

The incentive for buildingsafeand
fast highways likewise is that the
motorists would seek the alternative
of using someone else's roads or tak-
ing alternative transportation if the
highway is not up to high standards
of safety and maintenance. The ar-
bitrary and unrealistically low speed
limits now seen on the limited-access
highways would hopefully become a
thing of the past. and those who are
truly unsafe drivers due to drinking
or carelessness would be indentified
and simply banned from the
highway.

Each driver is now paying over
$I00 each year to build and maintain
highways. With private roads. the
driver would simply be giving the
money directly to the highway
owners rather than as taxes to the
State bureaucrats. With each driver
paying transportation expenses
directly. however. the true high cost
of automobile use would be brought
home more clearly and act as an in-
centive for seeking alternate
transportation. The accident rate
would decrease. pollution would
lessen. and fuel would be more plen-
tiful.

Rush hour truflic jams would be
virtually eliminated. Since the law of

supply and demand would regulate
the cost of road usage. increasing de-
mand (the supply of roads being the
same) would lead to correspondingly
higher tolls at normal rush hour
time. thus encouraging staggered
business hours to avoid rush hour. or
giving strong incentivo to leave the
car at home and use a bus ortrain. If
the demand is great enough. mass
transportation facilities would
proliferate quickly. and they would
not require huge subsidies from the
taxpayers in order to be profitable.
comfortable and economical.

The Michigan vote was morethan
a warning to Republican politicians
that they had better disassociatc
themselves from their Republican
president. i'hc' Democratic victory
in the 8th Congressional District
suggested more than Mr. Nixon‘s
unpopularity among the voters.
Tuesday's special election reflected
more than the futility in Nixon‘s
campaign to save his presidency.
The Democratic Victory this past
week clearly proclaimed that the
American people are just plain fed
up.

The President put agreat deal into
the Michigan election. The
Michigan Republican hierarchy did
not feel his presence in their state
would do much to help their can-
didule. They. in fact. encouraged the
White House to stay away. But the
White House was persistent and
Richard Nixon Iicw to Michigan
with one goal: tofprove through a
Republican victory that he was stilla
powerful force in national politics
and any attempts by the people in
Congress to vote for his impeach-
ment would hurt theirchances for re-
election.

Ol' course. conclusions can only be
drawn when there is a victory. In the
Mule-Linc White House

would have us believe that the con-
trupositive is inoperative. This is
revealed in the olficial response. Ac-
cording to Deputy Press Secretary
(icrald Warren the President was
neither "dismayed" nor “dishearten-
ed“ by the election results. You can
carry an untruth just so far. Arewc
to believe that Mr. Nixon and his
cabal arc “gluddcncd” and op-
timistic“ or perhaps just plain im-
mune to any negative interpretation
of the vote‘!

Whatever is said publicly. the
private discussions among
Republicans must be bleak and dis-
mal. They now have lost I'ourout of
live special Congressional elections
ol which at least three were assumed
to be safe Republican settts. They
can argue forever that issues like
energy. inflation. neighborhood
schools. crime. etc.wcre the cause of
defeat but these issues have often
served Republican candidates. not
hindered them.

So sooner or later enough
Republicans with clout willjust have
to say publicly what each one
already accepts privately. That is
that Richard Nixon is going to do
more to strengthen the Democratic
party in I974 Congressional elec-
tions this November than George

For What It’s Worth

McGovern did to harm the party in
I972. That is it bitter lemon to bite
on especially when you are talking
about the Number One man in the
Republican party.

Meanwhile the Democrats are en-
joying a new political high. From all
indications they are headed towards
u .VetO-proof ' congress this
November. l'hcy how a good
chance of capturing several gover-
norships. including New York‘s

After a nine: million dollar debt
their coffers are beginning to swell.
And if the Republican Party con-
tinucs to be plagued by its present
low popularity the Democrats just
may walk into loOll Pennsylvania
Avenue. The Democrats. so
proficient at showing off the scars of
intermtl political battle for the first
time in two decades can sit back and
watch the other side struggle with a
problem as big as LllJ. the Vietnam
War. Hubert Humphrey. and
George McGovern all in one.

Vice-President Ford. supposedly
the Republican party‘s last ace in the
hole drew perhaps the most absurd
conclusion from Michigan‘s elec-
tion. Citing ths election as “bad
omen" the Vice-President said “One
party control is not good for

America. And the trend in Cori-
grcssionul elections now is for the
Democrats to cud tip with an
overwhelming majority in the
House. llus will mean a legislative
dictatorship.“

James Reston of the Nt'u' )‘ork
linim described Mr. Ford as
"stupid" Ittsl week. llewasabsolutc-
ly correct. Since when does a majori-
ly in the House and/or Senate con-
stitute a legislative dictutorship'.’ Iiy
the same token one could argue that
it a Democrat ot‘chtlblican is presi—
dent then there is a Democratic or
Republican dictatorship. Similarly
it It Catholic is elected president. ac-
cording to Ford‘s logic we would
have a Vatican dictatorship. One
can be sure that when the
Republicans were suggesting a
“new majority" after the ‘72 elec-
lions. Mr. Ford did not warn
America of a one party dictatorship.

in spite of the Republican misfor-
tunes and the Democrats‘ new found
fortunes there are still the people of
Michigan and the rest of the nation
wh presently harbor a deep resent-
ment for all politics and politicians
alike. The Michigan vote simply
.suggesls that the American people
