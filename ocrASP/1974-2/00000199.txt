Mets in a Tailspin

by Bruce R. Maggin

-lf someone would have told
you that the Mets‘ Dave Schneck
and Don Hahn Would both be
batting over .400. you probably
would have thought that Mets
would be near the top of the
National League East.

However. this is not the case.
as the New Yorkers are moving
in the wrong direction and are
approaching last place. Before
the season started. the Mets‘ only
weakness appeared to be in
center field. After the first ten
games ofthe season. this position
has thus far prayed to bea Met
strong hold in art‘otherwisé field
of weaknesses. Schneck, who
had failed in previous trial with
the Mets. is playing the best ball
of any Met. His two-homerun
performance against Montral
Wednesday is goodatyidencc of
this fact.

A prime cause in the Mets

pretty ineffective relief pitching.
'l'ug McGraw doesn't appear to
believe anymore. as his earn-run-
average is over l0 and he has
contributed little. The rest ofthe
relief staff has proved equally in-
effective. helping to blow leads in
the late innings. Reporters love
.to second guess Mets manager.
Yogi Berra. for leaving in his
pitchers too long. but with a
bullpen that has thus far shown
little. Berra is certainly in a
dilemma.

Ace righthandcr ’l‘om Scavcr
claims to be the best pitcher in
baseball. AI pitcher of this caliber
should win the big game.
Throughout his career Seaver
has proved something less thana
clutch pitcher. Tuesday‘s game
against Montreal is a good ex-
ample. When a team has a losing
streak. like the Mets. the ace of
the staff is expected to pull the
team out of the slump. Scavcr

problems
supply them.

didn‘t do this and he has failed to
win a ame.

Run production is another big
problem. as the Mets are getting
nothing out of their first three
hitters. Lcadoff hitters are sup-
posed to get on base. The Mets‘
Wayne Garrett has completely
faich in this job. as hisaveragc is
under .l30. in Wednesday‘s
'gamc against Montreal. the
Mets‘ first three hitters. Garrett.
Millan and Staub. went zero for
twelve combined. adding up to
four complete innings of hitlcss
ball.

Thus far the Mets' season has
been a disaster. Berra probably
would say that things will turn
around and point to last year's
miracle comeback. However. the
Mets are playing ball like they
don‘t believe. The Mets can‘t dc—
pcnd on the other teams in their
division to lose. They must start
putting it together themselves.

saying around the Hub City. “Spahn

We all know by now that “it‘s
not nice to fool Mother Nature.“
but to the Albany Great Danes
baseball squad it must have
seemed that those margarine
people were up to their old tn'cks
over the past vacation. While
most of its were graced with the
opportunity to leave the wind
and cold for a while. the SUNY
defending champions watched

baseball a bit difficult. resulting
in several postponements as well
as a severe case of chapped lips.

Finally things got underway

splitting a double-header with
