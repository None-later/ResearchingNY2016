Albany felt 'extremely confi-

against Williams College. Dur-
ing spring intersession. the team
had captured two easy wins over
both Siena and Queens Colleges
(85-20. and 95-50), and one
closer victory (85-76) overdefen-
ding State University champion
Brockport. thereby extending its
three-year unbeaten dual meet
record string to 2| straight.
Some runners were given the
meet off. others switched events
for a change of see. a inst

seemingly light competition.
The complexion of the meet
began to change however. after

Danes Impressive
in Early Going

by Kevin C. Hilly

Last year Brockport blew us
off the field. Brady. Walsh,
O‘Bryan. and Harty scored a
goal apiece a week ago Satur-
day when Albany‘s Great Danes
opened their LaCrosse season at
Brockport. Connor. Walsh.and
Brady assisted on the scoring
plays. Albany played one man
short for five and halfminutes. as
a result of three slashing
penalties. outripping. one in-
terfelencc and one I un.
nessessary roughness penalty. It
was a game of mud and guts
played on a soggy Brockport
backwoods ﬁeld. A “Root Hog
Root!" game of defense was the
key to the close contest of
LaCrosse played that day. Bill
Jonat. Rolland Levie. and
freshman Dave Ahonen reacted
agrenivly to a strong Brock port
attack: holding them to two

goals. Albany‘s goalie Bob
Wulkiewicz stopped l3 shots and
allowed only two goals. The
final was the Danes first win ~~
Albany-4...Brockport~2.

The big gun for the Danes in
their second game was a Potter
by the name of Pete Connor. He
scored five goals and had one
assist against a hitting Hamilton
College defense. Attackmen
Steve Schaus pressed hard for
three goals and an assist. Brady.
Walsh. and Ccrra each scored a
goal. with Walsh assistingon one
as well.

The game. however. was not
peaches and cream. The halftime
had Albany in from 54. The
Danes “new coach. Dave
Armstrong. sparked the club to
score six goals in the second half.

Pete Connor opened the scor-
ing at last Wednesday‘s home
game against Middlebury
College. Middlebury came back
with two quick goals from two
agressive attackmcn to put them
ugcad. Connor hit again with
another unassisted goal in the sc-
cond period to tie the game for
Albany. Middlebury struck
again in the third.

into my event. thanks to the two
milers and Cleary."

Malone was confident. but
Albany had been burned
previously by ovcrconlidence in
the meet. Said Malone. “l was

pretty angry with myself after it

was over. i should bejumping 6
feet. 4 inches as idid indoors. but
I‘ve begun to stagnatc at 6 feet
even. i saw their guy practice
jump and I knew he‘d be easy to
heat. so I contented myself with
settling for a win.“

The win. at six feet, along with
Greg 'l'unningly‘s second place
jump of 5'10“. was more than
cnought to elatc the crowd of
teammates and spectators
gathered around the high jump
pit. by giving Albany its 22th
straight victory by a score of 76
to 69. It also completed another
strong individual showing for the
heroic Malone. who earlier had
taken second in the l20 yard high
hurdles to Williams‘Oscar Reed.
in a school record time of l5.4
seconds.

Malone docs little practice for
the hurdles. but the reason in this
case. is not ovcrconfidencc. “I'm
afraid il' I start working on
them.“ he explains. “,I will tend to
start jumping over them instead
of running over them as you
should do. Last year. though. I
did work pretty hard on the
hurdles.“ The result? “Well. I
wound up doing pretty well in
thc highjump."

Luckily. its hard to argue with
success. and Malone has been the
team‘s most successful performer
this spring. having gathered 25
points in three mccts. Only one
point back is John Streeter. who
has picked up three firsts and
three seconds in the 440 yard in-
lcrmcdiatc hurdles. and the triple
jump in the three contests.

and a third in the shot put against
Williams. Albany’s field men. in

cond places in both the shot put
