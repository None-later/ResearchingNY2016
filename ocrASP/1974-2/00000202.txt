SA Top Court,
Council, Deny
Johnson a Bid
At Presidency

by Mike Sens
Late Sunday night. the Supreme

Court voted to'ieject the petition of '

former Student Association
presidential candidate Tim Johnson
on a point of law. Justice Steve
Meyerreferred to a four year old
statue specifying that the petition of
a candidate must state the office the
candidate is seeking.

According'to Johnson. he filed a
petition for' which he thought was for
SA president. but actually was for
SAS'U Student Assembly delegate.
Johnson found out about the mis-
take and confronted Gerber. After
Johnson submitted a letter sayinghe
did not want to run for SASU, Ger-
ber invalidated his petition. John-
son‘s name would not appear on the
ballot for either SASU or SA presi-
dent. At this point things started to
happen.

Central Council voted that John-
son's name should be on the ballot.
earlier Sunday night. SA president
Steve Gerber then appeared and in-
troduced new evidence that some of
Johnson‘s signatures may be in-
valid. According to the election laws
all n‘ames must be undergraduate
students. Johnson had only a
minimum of signatures. so if any of
the students were grad student‘s his
petition would be invalid. Upon Ger-
ber‘s pressure, Central Council
voted to reconsider the matter.

The matter ended up in the SA
Supreme Court at l0:30 I’M. The
Court voted 5-! against Johnson.
Meyer speaking for the majority said
Johnson “was really fucked over at
everyturn.“ Meyer notedthulhe sym-
pathisizes with Johnson because an
SA office assistant gave him the
wrong form in the first place.

Justice Bauman. the one dissen-
ting vote said that the Court‘s deci-
sion was "unfair." “It is not proper
and just if Tim didn't beput on the
ballot, he never made a mistake.“
Bauman added. He explained that
Johnson shouldn't have to catch
SA‘s mistake. He added that the
decision was “pretty final.“

Meyer said that the decision was
reached after “heated discussion,“
indicating that tempers were Violent
and almost unanimously aimed
against SA and President Gerber.

PIRG Still Stuck At Boyer’s

by Dennis Esposit

The Central Ad ministration ofthe
State University of New York still
has yet to grant the SUNYA Public
Interest Research Group (PIRG at
SUNYAlpcrmission foratwo dollar
optional line to appear on this fall‘s
tuition bill.

It has been over three months
since .Iohn Hartley. Vice President
for Management and Planning. re-
quested authorization from SUNY
Central for l’lRG at SUNYA‘s
proposal. Any further delay in im-
plementation would almost
automatically end PlRG‘s chances
for their voluntary line. which will
mean that PIRG at SUNYA cannot
be placed on the bill for at least six
months.

The causes for SUNY Cen-
tral‘s procrastination are of par-
ticular interest. Reports indicate
mounting political pressures and in-
creased legal considerations for
PI R(l‘s proposal. Last week. Harold
Spindlcr. Vice Chancellor for
Business and Finance, acknowledg-
ed for the ﬁrst time that the New
York State Legislature was a persis-
tent factor in the consideration of
l’lltG.

Spindler. who allegedly promised
I’IRG at SUNYA's leaders a
definitive answer before the Easter

break. stated that many legislators
are now increasingly concerned with
the use of state university facilities
being used to support the statewide
NYl’lRG organization. '

Apparently, numerous legislators
are somewhat unsure over the im-
pact of NYPIRG recent “Political
Profit Project." The controversial
"Profile Project“ will be the first
comprehensive evaluation of New
York’s Assemblymcn and Senators
ever attempted in the state. and will
be publicized prior to the November
elections.

SASU (Student Association ofthe
State University) dclcgates‘meeting
with legislators several weeks ago.
said that many legislators were
worried over student obicctivity in
evaluating them. In addition.SUNY
Chancellor Ernest Boyer has
privately revealed that in his meeting
last 'month with Senate Majority
Leader Warren Anderson. the
organization of NYPIRG was dis-
cussed.

SUNY Central‘s legal department
also have been meeting with
Chancellor Boyer. In recent
meetings, SUNY lawyers have
cautioned Boyer over the possibility
of a lawsuit involving the State Un-
iversity and those who might dis-
aaree with the University beinit used

as a collection agency for outside
organizations not intrinsic to
educational functions.

. Specifically, they are questioning
whether the State University is on
firm legal grounds for permitting its
facilities to be used for non-profit.
nonopartisan organizations like.
NYPIRG.

Boycr's staff lawyers are also
aware of the potential statewide im-
pact of the l’lRG proposal. Their
answer to Albany State‘s proposal
will establish a sale precedent when
the voluntary fee question arises at
other colleges in the SUNY system.

SUNY College at l’lattsburg has
already requested the voluntary fee;
State University at Stony Brook is
currently petitioning for theirs. It‘s
an exercise in precuu iron forSUNY
Central; officials hinted that the
more campuses affected by their
decision. the greater the chancet at
a lawsuit might be attempted.

The extent to which the State Un-
iversity may collect voluntary fees
and under what guidelines. if any.
are at issue. In making that deter-
mination. SUNY Central ofﬁcials
have stressed that Albany State Un-
iversity is a state supported and con-
trolled institution, which must be
responsible to the state and ultimate-
ly the taxpayers who support it.
They said that any potential flak
from taxpayers about the use of stu-
dent fundcd organizations must be
seriously considered.

But Student Association Presi-
dent Steve Gerber views the issue in a
different perspective than SUNY
Central. When questioned last week.
Gerber strongly indicated that it is
the consensus ol‘studcnts and not the
taxpayers who should ultimately
determine what organizations are
voluntary funded on campus.
Secondly. it is the students. not the
taxpayers. who actually pay the
voltmtary fees at State Universities.

It has been rumored that SUNY
Central might prohibit the word
“PIRG” from appearing on the bill
and instead permit only the words
“Voluntary Fees."

0 Kim .luhase: How do you View
the position of Vice President of the
Student Association? ’

A. In Blrnbsum: The position of
Vice President I view as a very im-
portant one of course exactly what
he does is determined by the Presi-
dent and they have to work that out
however what i would intend to do is
do more than any just proscribed
duties I think u very important factor
for the Vice President is to go outon
his own when he gets upset about
something. when there is something
he feels should be done to create
issues and take them to Central
(founcil.possibly even the Senate.
not just sitting back... h

A. Ken Wax: Well the constitu-
tion dictates the Vice Presidcttt‘sjob
is g vent to him by thclpresidentult has
come to mean in past years that he
really has the management of the
situation within the Student
Association Office. He is in charge of
the operation and day-to-day ac-
tivities. In addition to this. the Vice
President also has input into the
President's decisions and can offer
tis own ideas on matters he doesn‘t
1;I\'L‘ direct control over
A: I’olydourlsrl would support the
President in carrying out his duties
and try to get more students involved
in student government and take an
active part in the discussion of the
issues with the students.

A:Baurnan: The Vice
President‘s job includes a lot of
things. I Would believe it would in-
clude initiating ideas introducing
legislation to ﬁre (‘entrat Council.
hopefully improving it. be mainly a
sounding board for students and
organizations representatives so at
least they feel they have some feed-
back into the organization.

0. Linda Gaylord: How do you
plan to deal with student apathy?

A: l'olydouris: To get more
students involved in student govern-
ment 1 would try to publicize the ac-
tivities of the student government
more. to publish the minutes for in-
stance in every weekly in every issue
of the ASP

A. Bauman: That‘s a problem that
people have been saying they have
answers to for as long as there has
been student government. There‘s
not really too much you can do ex-
cept go all out and make the best
government you have. so lhclstudents
want to gel interested in it. maybe
think its worth while. 'l'hclonlything
t can see doing is to do a little adver-
tising game goal of it and try to get
people involved that way

A. Blrnbaum: I think we have to
start here at a fairly low grass roots
level if we want to get people in-
volved and on this campus that
