I the anger and the’sarcasm surfaced
and were somtieh more effective
because they were unexpectedly
strong: yet still contained deﬁnite
elements of companion and
softness.

Ms. Morgan read works from her
book. Monster, and also some
poems written more recently. They
covered the political. intellectual.

. literary and emotional aspects of the

movement and ranged from a piece‘

on the Watergate women which sym-
pathi'zied with Martha Mitchell's
plight of having her “truths seen as
comic ‘ relief” and" depicted the
lonliness and loss of identity suffered
by Pat Nixon to a deeply personal

work which Ms. Morgan dedicated V

to her'mother. ‘ .
The high pointlof thepresentation
was her ﬁnal reading of the poem
“Monster“which emotionally
describes Robin Morgan’s reasons
for her involvement in the women's
movement. The poem gets its title
from the incident in which the
author’s son,“...on seeing me naked
for what must be the five-thousandth

time in his not-yet two years. he

suddenly [thought of the furry

creature who yawns through] his
fav’orite television program] con-
nected that image with my genitals;
laughed,/ and said. ‘Monster.‘ "
The poem goes on to deal with the
monster-like characteristices im-
posed on Women by men. It ended on
a note of touching and powerful
pride which was felt more by the,
audience. the majority of whom were
women. than anything else that
night. A standing ovation followed,
but the rush onstage by one woman,
in order to embrace and kiss Ms.

the sentiments of the evening.

There were some men in the
audience. most of whom stayed dis.
creetly out of the ront row, one or
two walked out when Robin Morgan
stated, during a question period that
she takes no enquiries from men. She
explained that, “most men will
change only when forced to change "
and that by stiﬂing them for a few
minutes they can perhaps loci. on a
much smaller ,scale, the frustration
women have 'felt when stifled by
men.

She also added that she used to
takequestions from men but claimcd
that most of the interrogations were
on “an intellectual lech which
hoovered, gently, near that of a
drunken flea... and ljust don‘t have
the time." Her stand was unfor-
tunate. There were few qucslions
from the women in thc audiencc.

There is this organiuttion called the Student Assembly. formed by and .i _ g . . . , . . . .~
' ' representingSUNY student interest at the legislature. In the Sta e Education --

recognized by the C huncellor of the SUNY sysiem and designed to operate as

a united student union type group in representing uniﬁed student opinion on v

SU NY-wide matters. The Student Assembly is almost one year old and con-
sists of all SUNY schools— the four year university centers and colleges. the
Ag and Tech schools and the community colleges.

There is also an organization culch SASU, Inc., which is about four years
old. consisting of just the four your university centers. most of the four year
colleges and some Ag and Tech schools. SASU Inc.. is an independent non-
profit corporation that still operates under the auspices of the Student

Assembly. Until this fall. SASU. Inc.

was not recognized as an ofﬁcial in-

stitution representing student interests by the Chancellor's ofﬁce.
SASt‘J. Inc.. while on the face of thcings appears to be identical‘in both
composition and purpose to the Student Assembly. is now in reality an

David Coync: This year. David
(‘oync has scrvcd as a member of
('cntral Cottucil. Through this he
has Worked with the past dclcgatcs to
SASU_und Student Assembly. He
has also gone to a SASU conference

a.

in which he lobbied with a few

othcr mcmhcrs of SASU and tom
llrown the Assemblyman from this
district. l‘rom thcsc involvcmcnts he
has gottcn to know what SASU and
Strident Assembly is about.

His areas of major interest are in
furthering reciprocity programs
between schools. l'his would mean
being able to use a university ID at
any of the campuses throughout the
state.

David believes the healthiest thing
that has come from SASU is a free
interchange of ideas between the
dillcrcnt schools involved. Also. he

I'ccls there have been signiﬁcant
gains due to the lobbying powor
SASU has used.

David is also runtting or Central
Council in hope that he might
hccomc chairman next year. Ht: feels
that this will not intcrferc with the
timc he needs to bc dclcgatc to
SASU and Student Assembly. citing
that there wcrc only about cight
meetings that this years delegates
were required ot attend.

become known by SASU as a hard

This week. during the election for Student Association officials. the names
of three candidates must be accepted by the student body as delegates .to
SASU Inc. What follows is an cxpluniation of who is running for that office.
their platfroms and qualifications

Linda's major interest is in in-

Linda is looking for more perma-

Kcn Wax: Having been on Central

Solicitations Committee. as well as

ntinistrators of this u Versity
qualifies Mr. Wax for SASU
delegate. Kcn l'ccls-thut SASU has
great potential but student involve-
ment will make or break it.

Ken thinks thttt by working in-
tnuttcly with the student govern-
ment and thc administrators at
Albany. Iic could represent our
students well.)

Mr. Wax‘s list of priorities is not
comprised of spcciliclcgislutivc bills.
llc feels it more important to let the
students know what is available to
them through SASU and Student
Asscntbly. Of primary importance to
SASU is continuing the respect
which thcy receive from the state
legislature.

 

Kcn would rather not say which
specific programs he is in favor of or
against hccausc he feels thc overall
philosophy of SASU‘s activities is
more important. Right now tltc big
qucstion is whcthcr to usc the money
they have in continuing to diversify
into new areas of studcnt representa-
tion or to focus the money into a
