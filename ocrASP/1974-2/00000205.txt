The State University of New York
has reafﬁrmed its support of faculty

tenture and rejected a quota system-

whieh would put a ceiling on the
percentage of tenured faculty in the
University.

"I

‘1 proposed:

Chancellor Ernest L. Boyer. in a i A

policy statement to presidents of
State University‘s 29 state-operated
campuses.‘ affirmed the Universitny
commitment to a continuation of
tenure. a tradition which he said “
has added enormously to the stabili-
ty and strength of our profession.“

Boyer further noted. “While there
are problems and potential for
abuses in its execution. the principle
is sound and the policy will be
preserved."

The Chancellor also stated:

“While a high percentage of
tenured faculty in a given depart-
ment Or at a campus may be
educationally harmful, it also seems
clear that an artifically imposed ceil-
ing cannot be defended.

“Such an arrangement ignores in-
terdepartmental and inter-campus
differences and may discriminate
against unusually gifted nontenured
faculty. including women and
minority group members as they
become available for employment in
larger numbers.

“For these reasons a rigid quota
system is unacceptable.“

The policy statemen. which is
supported by State University‘s
Board of Trustees. does recognize

('handefldr Ernest L. oner

the need to maintain a healthy tenure
balance at a time of plateanred
growth.

Dr. Boyerexplained. “The process
by which tenure decisions are made
must be strengthened to assure that
continuing appointment in the Un-
iversity is extended only to those
who have demonstrated the highest
competence and whose future per-
formance can be reasonably ex-
pected to be professionally ex-
cellent."

Each of the state-operated cam—
puses. the Chancellor said. will
clarify the criteria and procedure for
tenure decision. In addition. each
campus is to prepare an analysis of
its currentandprojected level of staf-
Iing and estimate the relationship
between tenured and nontenured
faculty dtiring the six-year period
between I974 and 1980.

datory age for retirement from 70 to
65 as well as the development of an
early retirement plan which would
make withdrawal from State Univer-
sity employment attractive at age 55
or 60.

The Chancellor said his statement
came in response to the reevaluation
of the existing tenure system as
called for in the University‘s I972
Master Plan and to "the tenure
debate which has intensified both
within and outside the progession."
It is the result of a widespread con-
sultation that has accrued duringthe
past six months.

"Dr. Boyer said that after ap-
propriate further consultation with
faculty. administration and
students. he plans to present to the
University‘s Board of Trustees
specific proposals for amendment of
their Policies as appropriate.

Suits Against Ohio State Officials

by Vernon A. Guildry. Jr.
(AP) - Spurred by suits following

'the deaths of four students at Kent

State University in I970. the
Supreme Court Wednesday opened
the way for citizens to take state of-
ficials into court to answer for their
acts.

The high court unanimously re-
jected the notion that state officials
have an absolute immunity from law
suits. They have immunity for their
official acts, said” Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger for the court, but
it is qualified.

the court thus kept alive damage
suits against Ohio officials brought
by relatives of three of the four
students slain in a confrontation
with Ohio National Guardsmen dur-
ing a protest against the Indochina
War.

The justices sent the cases back to
a lower federal court for more
proceedings to determine the extent
of the humanity of theofficials nam-
ed as defendants.

the defendants include former
(iov. James Rhodes. tlic adjutant
general ol the state National Guard.
officers and enlisted men of the
guard and the university president.

the suits were filed by families of
slain students Sandra Scheuer.
Allison Krause, illld Jeffrey Glen
Miller.

Mrs. Martin Seheucr. Boardman.

said ofthecourt's decision: “ltsltows
our system of j usticc is working. I‘m
very pleased that finally we're getting
something done.“

Former Adj. Gen. Sylvester Del
L‘orso. head of the National Guard
at the time of the incident. said: "We
were all agents of the state of Ohio.
We did not act as individuals."

The Supreme Court vote was 8 to
0. with Justice William 0. Douglas
taking no part.

Last month a federal grand jury in
Cleveland indicted eight of the
National Guardsmen on charges of

violating t e civil rights of the
students who . were killed~ and
wounded. The indictments were not
related to the civil suits on which the
Supreme Court acted.

A federal district courtjudge had
dismissed the civil suits at avery ear—
ly stage. saying he lacked jurisdiction
because the cases were essentially
against the state itself and therefore
barred by the federal constitution.

that action was premature. said

Amendment ban on federal suits
against states does not uniformly bar
such suits for damages against in-
dividual officials.

The U.S. Circuit Court at Cincin-

sion. adding its own view that the
doctrine of executive immunity was
absolute and that the suits were
doubly barred. The high court
reversed that view.
