The following is an-excerpt from
Snell's statement.

‘Prior to and during WorId‘War
II. General Motors. Ford and

Chrysler. dominated motor vehicle

production lnboth the United States
and Germany. Due, to its mass
production capabilities. automotive
manufacturing is one of the most
crucial industries with respect to
national defense. As a result. these
corpprationﬁretained the economic
and political power to affect the
shape of T governmental relations
both within and between Germany
and the US ins manner which maxi
imized corporate global proﬁts.

“In short. they were private
governments unaccountable to the
citizens of any country.‘ yet possess-
ingitremendous influence over the
course of war and peace in the world.
As a result they were able to max-
imize profits by supplying both sides
with the material needed to conduct
war.

“As the Axis Powers overtly
prepared for war. G M. Ford and to a
lesser extent. Chrysler. found
themselves involved in serious con-
flicts of interest and national
loyalties. Due to their concentrated
economic power over motor vehicle

i

production in both Alliedj and Axis
territories. the Big Three inevitably'
became major factors in the
preparations and progress of the
war. ' '

“G M's participation in Germany's
preparation for war began as early as
I955. That year its Opel subsidiary
cooperated with the Reich in
locating a new heavy truck facility at
Brandenburg. which military of-
ficials advised would be less
vulnerable to enemy air attack. Dur-
ing the succeeding years, GM
supplied the Wehrmacht with Opel
“Blitz” trucks from the Brandenburg
complex.

.‘l‘For these and other con-
tributions: to wartime preparations.

{GM‘s chief executive for overseas
operations in I938 was awarded the
Order of the German Eagle (first
class) by Chancellor Adolf Hitler.

“The outbreak .of war in
September. I939. resulted inevitably
in the full conversion of GM and
Ford of their plants in Axis countries
to the production of military aircraft
and trucks. During the last quarter
of 1939. for instance. GM converted
its 432-acre Opel complex in
Russelsheim to warplane produc-
tion.

“It was. of course, in the best in-

in the German war effort. Although '

GM. for example, was in complete
management control of its
Russelsheim warplane factory for
nearly a full year after Germany’s
declaration of war against the Un-
ited States on December ll. l94l.its
refusal to build warplanes w uld
have brought about the economic
collapse of its Opel plant. Moreover.
it might have resulted in confiscation
of the facility by the German
Government.

“In fact. on November 25, I942,
the Reich did appoint an ad-
ministrator for the Russclheim

GM and Ford demanded
reparations from the US govern-
ment for wartime damages sustained
by their Axis facilities as a result of
Allied bombing. By I967. GM had
collected more than 833' million in

reparations and Federal tax beneﬁts '

for damages to its warplane and

motor vehicle properties in formerly .

Axis-contrdlled territories, in-
cluding Germany. Austria. Poland.

press room for further comment.
GM replied: “The allegation that
G M assisted Nazi Germany‘s war ef-
fort is false. A German board of
managers appointed by the Nazis
assumed responsibility for daily
operations of Opel after September
3. I939. After the US and Germany
were at war. the operation was under
control of a German alien custom

However. in a footnote to his
report. Bradford Snell refutes in

detail the GM argument: “GM can.

declared war on Germany without
any apparent interference by do
German government up until

in its appointment of Luer. however.

Report Pins Infertility On Grass

by Warren E. Leary

BOSTON (AP) Men who smoke
large amounts of marijuana run the
risk of decreasing their fertility. ac-
cording to a report coauthored by
noted sex researcher William H.
Mitstcrs. w

.The report. published in the New
England Journal of Medicine. was
based on the work of researchers at

V the Reproductive Biology Research

Foundations in St. Louis. headed by
Masters.

Thcy tested 20 men who smoked
from live to l8 “joints” a week for IR
months or longer and found that 35
per cent had noticeably decreased
sperm counts.

They also found that blood levels
of the sex hormone testosterone
averaged 44 per cent lower in the
drug users than uonusers. and that
two of the chronic smokers were im-
potent “appurcntly in association

with marijuana use."

The report noted that one of these
men returned to normal sexuality
within two months after he discon-
tinued marijuana use. but the other
declined to give up the drug.

Mitstcrs coauthored the survey
along with Drs. Robert Kolodny an
Gelson Tom. and Robert M.
Kolodncr.

The study warned that the results
should be taken cautiously because
of the small size of the sample. lack
of data on the potency of the mari~
juttna and because it was impossible
to measure hormone levels and
sperm counts of the men before they
took up the drug.

The researchers worked with men
lit to 28 years old. They were com-
pared with 20 similarly healthy men
of the same age who did not use the
drug.

Sherman was killed by Ronald
Baldine. a bearded. 29 year old agent
of the Mahoning Ashtabula Trum-
bull Counties (MAT) Narcotics
Agency. Baldine ﬁred his' pistol a
.357 magnum loaded with .38 caliber
bulletéwithin “a fraction of an inch"
of Sherman's head. according to a
member of the Cuyahoga County
Coroner's office.

However. according to Capt.
Orlando DiLullo. director of MAT
and Baldinc‘s superior, the gun was
fired at a distance of two to four feet
from Sherman after Sherman made
a threatening move toward his belt
as if to pull out a weapon. DiLullo
participated in the arrest.

'l‘est ﬁrings by the Ohio Bureau of

Criminal Investigation conﬁrmed-

that the lethal shot was ﬁred atadis-
tance of less than two inches.

The incident took place shortly
after midnight on a rural road about
ten miles southeast of Kent. Accor-
ding to DiLullo. Sherman and three
companions had arranged to meet
with three MAT 'agents including
Baldine to sell the agents 25 pounds
of marijuana at $250 a pound.
