I have been involved in student
government ever since I- was in high
school. I was the Vice President of
my high school student government

association in my junior year (it is -

not Ilth grade because in Hong
Kong ..we ﬁnish our high school
education in I I years). Owing to the
misuse of student funds, the Presi-
dent that year resigned in the tmiddle
of his term. lassumed his Presidency
constitutionally. l .was reelected
President the following’t year—proof
of my competence in the ofﬁce.

Two years ago. I went to ajunior
college in Florida (Gulf Coast Junior
college). The areas I was assigned to
cover were on the activities of inter-
national students and the student
government association. This ex-
perience has greatly reinforced my
understanding of how student
government functions.

During my year at Gulf Coast. I
was invited to be a member of the
national honorary fraternity Phi
Theta Kappa in my sophomore year
and I had been placed on the dean's
list every single semester until my
graduation last May.

I did not participate in the
SUNY/t S.A. because I was just a
newly transfer student last semester.
Besides. I was working on a book
about the Orient for the Wallacet
Homestead Book Co. (a publishing
company which belongs to the
national ABC| television network).
The book was to help the American
pc0plc understand the Orient better
and it was published in January this
year under the title "Oriental
Primer.“

As a political science major. and
with my past working experience in
efﬁciency control. I would say I can
handle the job as S.A. President
better than any other candidates.
Because I was trained to be sharp in
spotting errors and analytical in ef-
ficiency control in actual business
administration. I havea keen advan-
tagc over othercandidates in making
the S.A. function more effectively.

Before I stop writing. lwould like
to mention one more thing.
Although I wonld not stop other
S A. officials from drawing their
salary. I will not draw the “.500
provided for my ofﬁce. I feel that
when a person is involved in taking
money from the students. he is just
not willing to let the students know
much about the budget. My refusal
in taking the money will definitely
put me in a better position in making
the S.A. budget more accountable
and accessible to our students.

P-AGE TWELVE

Suppose during the course of next
year President Benezet suddenly
declares martial law on campus, em-
powers Security to carry sub-
machine guns. informs studentsthey
have no right to help choose the new

university president. and orders all
non-tenured faculty to jump off the
roof of the Administration Building.
Meanwhile FSA triples its board
prices. and Mayor Corning decides
to burn the houses of all student
tenants. Off the wall? Only in degree.
but wouldn‘t it help if the Student
Association president who had to
face such an afternoon had a little
experience? Two years on Central
Council (one year_ as its Vice-
Cbairperson). a year in the Universi-
ty Senate. working as 'co-leader of
the NYPIRG Organizing Com-
mittee. and many other endeavors.
have given me valuable insight into
the kinds of problems a student
leader has to solve. and what
problem-solving techniques will
work in a given situation.

Anybody can say they're going to
do this or that. But how does a voter
judge which candidate has the best
chance of accomplishing the most?
Qualifications. Some people would
rather offer excuses than examples
ot‘experience.

 

Vice Presidential Candidates Make llinaI Pre-Election St

Ira Birnbaum

I believe that my involvement
with S.A. over the last two years
has given me the best preparation
for the job of Vice President, Last
year I served as President of Alum-
ni Quad Board. giving me an neutc
awareness of the unique. often
neglected. needs ofcommutcrs and
Alumni Quad residents. Further-
more. I became awareol' the need
to bring the Quad Board leaders
together to work out scheduling
conflicts and to diversify program-
ming.

This year I have served as aCen-
tral Council representative. My in-
volvement this year on Finance
Committee and on the S.A.Budget
Committee have brought me into
contact with almost every S.A.
Funded group. giving me a com-
prehensiontof the purposes of these
groups. which I consider essential
to thcjob of S.A. Vice President. I
have also served as Chairperson of
the Election Reform Committee.
thereby uttemptingto make it more
easy for students to participate in
the voting process. As Chairperson
of the Miami Investigation Com-
mittee. I was upalled by the attempt
of student government leaders and
class officers to use their elected of-
fices for their personal gain. I
would permit no such actions next
year. More important to many
students involved. I did my best to
see that extra basses be provided so
that as many students as possible
who deserved a chance to go could
do to.

Friends have told me it's
ridiculous, to fatten issues and

; , qualiﬁcations in this campaign, that

I too need a posiet' with a picture of
me. and that I can‘t possibly meet
eriough people on dinner lines.
movie lines. and door-to-door to win
the election. I don‘t believe that.
Anybody can talk about improving
communication between students
and SA. but relying on posters and
pictures rather than personalcontact.
in a campaign certainly makes that
go kind of candidate look aloof and not

I 3 genuinely concerned.

Next year I want to see SA tackle

things no one else has thought of. No
one else may see Sa's potential as an
organizational dynamo. well-
equipped to deal with student con-
cerns such as landlord-tenant
problems of commuters. consumer
complaints. and prices and service in
the university's bookstore and inﬁr-
mary. to name a few examples. At
the same time. something has to be
done for thevasttmajority ofAlbany
State students who are not getting
their $64 worth of the mandatory
tax. To deal with these problems I'd
establish the Off-Campus Student
Co-op. the Student Consumer
Bureau. and Project PROBE. Ad-
ditionally. I‘m developing an incen-
tive plan whereby more money
would be distributed to the quads
after they how come up with in-
novative ways to spend it. SA would
work closely with quad leaders to br-
ing forth their best talents. and to put
a stop to inter-quad! squabbles. I‘d
like to see Concert Board hold con-
certs which appeal to more people.
This may mean divvying up .the
money among fewer shows. Also. I'll
try to persuade Central Council to
appropriate money s'o that movies
will be free. That. in a nutshell. is the
$64 ltnswer.

  

One of my top priorities for next
year would be to insure active stu-
dent participationl in the selection
of a successor to President Benczct.
I would work for lower prices to be
charged for student taxpayers and
a corresponding rise in the prices

for non-student taxpayers. The
Quad Boards. beingthe mostdirect
contact S.A. has with our tax-
payers. should be more heavily

funded. I would establish a new
position of Quad Board Co-
ordinator to bring the Quad Board
leaders together to integrate and
diversify their programming. The
S-Quad VolunteerAmbulance Ser-
vice should be funded by any

means possible. but I would ap-
point a committee to look into all
possible outside avenues of fun-
ding. I Would have the S.A. take
over the chartering of basses for
the vacations (currently operated
rather proﬁtably byafew students)
at a non-proﬁt basis savina tb-
some $5 on each ticket.

My qualificationsi' for S.A.
President include my serving as
Colonial Quad representative on
University Senate forZ 1/2 years. I
have also been appointed to the
Council on Promotions and Con-
tinuing Appointments (where I
worked closely with the administra-
tion). For 2 years. I have served as a
member of the A.M.l.A. Council.
where I sponsored legislation which
allowed women to become members
of the council.

year. I did resign during the ﬁrst two

met at the same time as Council. I
did serve on Council committees.
however. throughout the year.

' I am running for S.A. President
because I feel that the present system
cannot continue to operate the way it
has in the past. I am shocked to see
people involved in student govern‘

'ment receiving special privileges.t'
This type of graft and corruption will
not continue under my administra-
tion.

" John Polydouris

Real power is always fought for.“
is never Blvcntand I aim to get real
power for the Student Association.
“Power to the quads“ might be an
allright slogan for my opponents.
but my slogan is "power to the per-
son." As a dynamic ﬁghter for
students‘ power I will make an
enthusiastic Vice President. An
enthusiasm as I have said before. is
one of the most important in-
grcdicnls in a successful Vicc Presi-
dent.

One way to increase revenue for
SA might be an on-eampus lottery
run by SA. Prizes could be given
from the bookstore.

'A decentralization of
SA completely would only serve to
weaken the students‘ power on cam-
pus. Qpponents of mine are for total
decentralization and I oppose this.
SA meetings should be level!
publicity and the decisions and the
minutes summarized in the ASP
every week.

Regarding tenure. SA has a moral
obligation to ﬁght for teachers‘
rights as well as students‘ rights and
should work in supporting teachers.
No qualiﬁed teacher should be
denied tenure.

I ttm very concerned over the
fact the State Legislature has termed
the university a "mature campus"
andt is ceasing the completion of the
budding plans of Edward Durell
Stone. A field house is necessary for
a university of our size. This Is the
first and foremost on the agenda: we
should also look forward to extran-

    

A major issue on campus is the
breaking of “Click Rule." We must
stop an elite minority from
allocating student funds for their

own {special interests. More input is
needed from the student body and
the student association should seek
it. Under the present system. this
isn't being done.

Another issue is the improper and
unfair funding of student groups. I
feel that all of the quad boards and
the commuter club should receive
the same amount. (Hopcfttlly$5.0(lt)
each). The extra money can be
found by cutting the E.0.l’,S./\.
budget (540.000) to where it is more
representative of the amount ol peo-
ple in the group. I also don‘t want
S.A. executives nor Central Council
members paid by student tax. This
would save $7500.

I feel that S.A. groups should be
allowed to spend their money in
which ever way they want. lhe
groups are the ones who really know
what the "people" want. not the S.A.
rulers (who place themselves abote
the intcrcsts of the students).

I also feel that the President ol the
Student Association has become too
powerful and authoritarian a job.
By giving out jobs to many people.
the S.A. will once again become il
voice of the masses. not ol just a
select few.

In conclusion. I would like to
point out that lhuvc gettrcd my catn-
paign to all of the people. I have not
made any private promises to
different groups. I hope that you all
have taken the chance to read our
different letters which I have [out
culatcd around the campus. I want
everybody. not just members at
quad boards or S.A. funded groups.
to know how I feel on the issues.
Let's all get involved and rctnrn the
control of government to all ol IllL‘

people!

Andy Bauman

What follows is a summary of my
candidacy in short and simpletcrms.
Read it and think about it. please:
their vote your conscience.

My qualifications for Vice Presi-
dcttt will speak for themselves. Wltilc
attending Central Council meetings.
I httvc gttincd a thorough knowledge
of its workings. As a tncmbcr of the
University Senate. Iunderstund how

university policy is formulated and
enacted. Because I was an otttspokcn
member of this years's SA Budget
Committee. I have heard from each

of the many groups iii the SA. thus
helping me understand the r in-
dividual problems. I have u better
awareness of the SA Constitution. as
a Justice on the Supreme Court.

My perspective. though. is not
limited only to within our own cum-
pus. As a statewide participant in the
Student Assembly ttnd SASU. Ican
understand the problems we face

with an often repressive State
Legislature. and our position in the
Stttte University system. In addition.
I am the Assistant SASU Coor-
dinator for the Albany campus.

My priorities as Vice President are
tiimple and quite feasible. My first
priority would be to create
recreational areas in each of the

sciousness should be put on lower
priority lists.
Issues- Academie-
ACT. the Assessment of Courses
and Teachers should continue. This
provides students with information
that is vital in the planning of an
academic career. The sturggle for
student participatory roles in faculty
tenure and promotions shall persist.
The rights for students to continue to
make their own decisions for time of
withdrawl should remain unchanged
rttthcr than moved to the 9th week.
More study areas should be
designated. for the residence halls
and the library are already choked.
Programming
In the area of getting more beneﬁts
from our tax dollar. lpropose the cf-
l'orls of S.A. aim toward the con-
struction of tltc Field House. Muss
programming and athletics will be
safer and more profitable. A
Programming Council should be es-
tablished to provide good events
t‘Vt‘I‘II' u't-t‘kt'ml. Thc'council.‘ com-
prised of mass programming groups
\vorking toward these ends. conflicts
in advertising and times and
locations can be curbed.
University Community
The students' needs and intcrcsls
should guide tltc sclcciton of a new
University President. The gym
should be open more often and the
basketball and tennis courts should
be lighted.
Services
S.A. should continue the support of
SASU and its legislative program.
including retaining our right to tax
ourselves and exempting student
from paying state sales tax on re
quired text book purchases. Tht
need for prompt ambulance service
ant) ﬁrst aid and medical training
should continue through The Five
Quad Ambulance Service
perpetuating.

  

shuptru

. .- .
quads. possibly including a pool
table. ping pong. pinball. and aT.V
set. I believe that the creation of
Ibcsc areas is long overdue. At the

same tintc. we must increase Qtutd
budgets. and concentrate on have
more Quad functions. at the saute
time we must make every feasible
attempt to reduce admission prices
for many SA funded activities. We
are paying $64 a year. and yet we still
must pity substantial admission
prices. I would say a reordering of
priorities is nescccttry here.

Finally. we must be sure that Five
Qtatd Volunteer Atnbulancc Servtcc
is funded in the future. We would

press for University funding. but if it
doesn't materialize. then we should
support it.

And so. Ittsk foryour vote. Thank
you.

 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 

‘ ' magn
Does one haVe to be I memul‘ 0f 'pus activities and a revised weekend

Central Council or have prior ex-
perience in student government to
become SA President?

I strongly disagree. As a‘Political
Science major. I believe candidates
are made. not born. One can still be
Jack of All Tradesmd yet master of
some. I qualify myself as an all-
around candidttlc and person. Liv-
ing on campus for three years on
Colonial Quad has made me more
aware of students‘ needs and specific
problems. I have been directly and
indirectly involved with various ac-
tivities and functions on campus. To
name a few: I was a reporter and
feature writer for the ASP. I am a
member of
Students Association. We played
competitive sports in the AMIA for
four years. I presently hold office as
Chairperson of

the

“Friends.”

should follow State  Board's
example and seek to gain extra '
revenue. This would 1not7pit the?
Quad Boards against each other or
he student government. but Would
rve the best interest of the students
it each respective Quad.
Commuters make up one half of
 this university. There is a need for
commuter involvement in allaspects
‘ f university life. Commuters must
assert themselves as a vocal part of
,the campus body. not just attending
classesfrom 9 AM to 5 PM. Bus ser-
vice should be provided so that com-

ten muters can be attracted back to cum-

whcdule at least up to 2 o'clock.

Students‘ interest is secondary to
the ad ministration‘s' real say in the
policy and decision making process.
Teachers that we have grown to love
utnd respect for their teaching ex-
cellence are being phased out and
replaced with robots. incapable of
teaching or of students’ needs. Re-
cent unrest on SU NY campuses all
point to the fact that students are
getting shafted with their eyes wide
open. More student pressure must be
applied to' improve the quality of
campus life.

Student government must be
brought out of the SA office and
Central Council meetings and out to
the students. SA not.only needs a
house cleaning. but a face-lifting.

   
 

New people uninvolved in the past
with student government should be

humane. diverse and multicultural

aroup.

I believe in mandatory student

tax. providing that all University
groups receiveafair allotment ofour
tax money and contribute to the
campus body as a whole. I support
funding for smaller groups as well as
big organizations

SASU conference as an observer.
and was instrumental irt rectifying
the Miami bus trip fiasco. ‘

To the oflicc of the Vice President
I would bring with men continuance
of my activities on behalf of the
students and certain concerns only
an SA executive can effectively in-
vestigate. such as halting the in—
creasing use of graduate students to
teach courses.

The job I consider paramount is
that of getting information out ofSA
and into the hands of the students.
Those of you who know my column
in the ASI' know that I‘ll try to make
SA information informal—person
to person—not boring. unread

newsprint. And. of course. with the
greater information students will
find it easier to get involved if they
choose to do so.

No. I‘m not going to make any
wild campaign promises such as
huge quad appropriation increases.
or ten cent movies. I‘d advise asking
any candidate who makes such
claims just where he plans to get the
money to do so. Is that candidate

planning to raise the tax?

The upcoming election will have

seven Presidential candidates vying
for the SA Presidency. but the
students will only have two real
choices. There is the continuance of
the status quo offered by six of the ,
candidates. and there is the new. in-

novative choice offered by myself. _
Some may feel that the above
statement borders on arrogance. yet
consider the following: They all feel
that SA functions should be cheaper.
but they can only be cheaper if the
students pay more tax. They all feel
that SA should be more responsive.
yet their suggestions to conduct polls
and create new committees are old
ideas. ideas that have been tried and
that have failed miserably. Their
premises are old and musty.
promises borrowed from other
politicians desperate for office.

Did not Steve Gerber offer these
same. time worn promises when he
ran for President? Did not the Presi-
dent before Steve offer the same
promises? Do you perceive any im-
prove ment in the Student
Association? If you do. the other six
candidates are the ones to choose
from . If. on the other hand. you feel ’
that something is terribly wrong with
SAttnd its services to the student
community. then I offer you a
different choice; a choice of new
priorities. new direction. I believe
that I offer the triumph of individual
rights and dignity over the choking
legalisms and political bickering
offered by the others.

I believe that tht-rstudents of this
campus need a bill of rights with cer-
tain guarantees from the SA.Such
guarantees should include a policy
on seeking redress of grievances
front the courts. not from the same
politicianswho make the rules. The
SAshould not be permitted to make
declarations or transactions that
carry political overtones. Not only
should SA involve itself in the tenure
process in order to retain 'good
professors. but it should involve
itself in order to release those
professors who are poor instructors.
ttnd thus harmful to the students‘
education.

Finally. the only way that we can
guarantee that SA will work right
and for the benefit of the student
community. is to lay the foundations
for a voluntary tax. No need for
polls. committees. political spoils
and the rest of the reﬁll mess
proposed to make SA more respon-
sive. These methods have been or are
being tried. and they don‘t work. But
a voluntary tax would force SA to
work. because if they worked. then
students would willineg pay the tax
in order toderiVe the beneﬁts offered
by a responsive SA.

If you feel it‘s tim fora change. a
time to put a more human face on
SA. then I ask for your vote. And In
your deliberations for a SA Vice
President. please consider John
Polydouril. He too offers a new
direction. Reject the old and
decrepit. and usher in a new era on
campus.
