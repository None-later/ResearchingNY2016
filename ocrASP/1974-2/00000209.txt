My name is Linda Kaboolianland
I am seeking election to a
SASU/Student Assembly delegate
position. My committment to these
organization runs deep. as I feel that
they are our most viable vehiclctlfor
changing the higher education
system so that.“ representsl the
students‘ wishes. voicing the views
of ,thuSUNY students?
SASU/SAlare growing to both
scope and effectiveness. They will
continue to protect our rights in the
State Legislature and present our
viewpoints to the Chancellor and
SUNY Central Administration.
They will only continue through
strong leadership and direction from
the SASU Executich Board. My
committment runs to representing
SUNY-Albany in such a position.
My Qualifications are: Active par-
ticipation at the SASU Legislative
Conference; Conference on Higher
Education: representative of SUNY-

David Coyne

By way of introduction. my name
is David Coyne and lam running for
SASU Rep/Student Assembly
delegate. I suck this position because
I have a genuine concern for the
future of two organizations that
possess great potential in providing
for the general welfare of all SUNY
students

| huvc'dcdicutcd myself to work-
ing within governance for two years
now and have also been a very active
participant in SASU and Student
Assembly.‘ May Ijust
say that my dedication to tppjob is
extensive and my experience is
significant.

There is. in thiscasc.an election to
office that is more important than

my own. There appears
to he only one candidate running for
SASU/SA esccutivc committee.

Alseat on the SASU/SA ex-
ecutive committee being held by a
SUNY-Albany rep is of necessity for
the continued growth of both the
organiration and our university. The
person who we must elect to this
position is qualified and committed
but most important the is a must for
SASU/SA. Vote for Linda
Kubooillln.

SA SU
Candidates

The Student Association of
the State University (SASU) and
the Student Assembly are the
two statewide organizations to
which SUN Y Albany send [bur
representatives. The Student
Assembly (established in
response to a resolution by the
S UN Y board of trustees) is the
legal body recommending policy
measures to‘ the! Chancellor and
the Board of Trustees. SASU is
the incorporated arm of the Stu-
dent Assembly which has as its
pritmtry purposes lobbying for
the student good at the
legislature artd SUNY central.

among the schools. S‘AS U dues

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Ken Wax

I‘m running for SASU represen-
tative and Vice President because I'
feel the two positions complement
each other well. Unlike the President
of SA. the Vice President is not
automatically It SASU delegate and ‘
| feel it important this position be
represented.

Delegates from all the State Un-
iversities and State Colleges meet
regularly in It sort of Senate to dis-
cuss and put together position
papers on various mattersthat affect
all SUNY students. such us Security
carrying firearms and the mandatory
tax. SASU lobbies at the State
Assembly and Senate on behalf of
student causes. Although a new idea.
still in its infancy. SASU isutoolof
the future and respect for the group
by state legislators is growing evcry~
day.

lattcndcd the Buffalo SASU con-
ference Its a representative/observer
from Central Council. I know what ‘
is going on and want to become a
part of this students‘ lobby.

I feel my record of past involve-
ment speaks well for itself and
provides a valid index of what can be
expected from me as a SASU
delegate. Thank you.

Ken Stokem

The coming year will see the fifth
anniversary of SASU. Inc. and the
second anniversary of the state-wide
Student Assembly. Albany
State as It single entity cannot have
much effect on the New York State
legislature. One-hundred. sixty
thousand students with voting
parents under one uniﬁed organiza-
tion (SASU. Inc.) can. Those same
l60.000 students demand many
necessary services (insurance. press
service. travcl programs. etc.) that
can be obtained much more cheaply
and effectively on astute-wide basis.

In the past year on the Executive
Committee. the Rules Committee.
and as Treasurer of SASU. Inc. and
Student Assembly. I have been in«
volvcd in the pursuit of these goals.
On this campus as a former hair-
man of Central Council and an ac-
tivc participant in most every level of
Student Association and University
Government I can effectively relate
Albany State students‘ interests to
these programs. I Would hope that
you would re-elect me as one of the
three delegates to SASUJnc/Stu-
dent Assembly and that you would
also support the candldacics of

David Coync and Linda Kabooliun.
