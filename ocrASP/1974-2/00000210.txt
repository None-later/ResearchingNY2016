A Curran-Wax Ticket
This year. the S.A..Presidential and Vice Presidential races are characterized by a
myriad of personalities. The air has been ﬁlled with promises, accusations and
counter-attacks. .which have done little to help clarify who stands for what. it is more
than difﬁcult or the average student to differentiate the person from the rhetoric and
to be able to assess the true value of what each candidate has to offer.

' ltlis 'essential that those persons elected to the executive positions be equal to the
tasks that face them. When all the crap that is politics is raked aside, the individuals and
their capabilities stand to be judged. The task of the S.A. executives is an enormous
'one. and Ink handles successfully. must be placed in the hands of the individuals who
best exhibit leadership and administrative qualities. Ability then. is a key factor in this
election. .

After intense conSideIation. hashing and rehashing. and exhaustivediscussion, the
ASP is throwing its editorial support to Pat Curran for President and Ken Wax for
Vice President of Student Association. 'Our decision was based onwhat we felt to the
requirements of the two jobs. the priorities involved. and how the individual can-
didates measured up to them. ‘ ~ -

I’at Curran is familiarwith the system and has proven himself-a concerned and in-
formed individual. He has experience working with‘the student government in the past.
while at the saute time being one of its most outspoken critics. He knows his way
around. and when-all is said and done. there is no substitute for true experience. No
amount of coaching. no claims of fresh approach can hope to equal the value of ex-
perience. especially when you‘re dealing with professionals: administrators. legislators.
bureaucrats; ‘ ’ ' .I.

For the sake of the students of this University. it needs a person who will not only
support and defend their interests. but who has the resources and the ability to carry
them through. No other candidate can claim such assets.

Pat is by no means limited to bureaucratic abilities. He is a dynamic personality. ;.;.
capable of insp'ring confidence in those around him. His are the interests of a student.
and he sees the issues in the perspective of a student. His concerns evidence an un-

sees what can be achieved realistically. rather that resorting to overblown promises or
nebulousﬂlueﬂionl that never could be realized. With Pat Curran. there is something
beneath the rhetoric. .

Ken Wax is mature. conﬁdent and verbal. but perhaps the combination of con-
ﬁdence and approachability stand out most strongly in his favor. As Vice President of
S.A.. his job will be to keep the ofﬁce mnninrt well. to meet the more immediate ad- ‘

ministrative responsibilities and to assist the President as executive ofﬁcer of the stu-
dent governing body.

The key to Ken is his accessibility. the easy manner in which he can deal with people
and their problems. This case of manner. coupled with know-how and drive. can only
be an asset to the average student-on-the-poditlnwho needs information, direction and
straight answer. Ken is without a doubt able to meet thejob of S.A. Vice-President.

A Curran-Wax team in the S.A. executive positions promises a mixture of com-
petenceand concern. When it comes to representation. the two most closely approach
the ideal. yet offer a realistic and practicable answer to thecryfor a responsive S.A.

Editor's Note: This article is Iheﬁrrl of a two-
parr series. Part II will appear in next
Tuesday's issue of Ike ASP.

Critics say the University is going downhill.
They claim the campus is overcrowded. that
our budget is inadequate. that SUNYA is los-
ing a lot of its best professors.

“Not so". says Philip Sirotkin. Vice-
Prcsidcnt for Academic Affairs. The Number,
Two man in the administration is quick to dis-
agree with most criticisms of SUNYAuppcur-
ing is the campus press and some of the local
media. He says they present adistortcd. unfair
picture of the University and that it “just isn‘t
so". Much like Richard Nixon is his “What's
Right With America" speeches. Sirotkin asks
us to look at what's right with the University.

Okay. then. What irrigbt with the Univer-

Hcre are some of the Vcep‘s own
suggestions:

The importance of SUNYA research is be-
ing widely recognized and is becoming in—
lcrcasingly uelltfundcd. It is becoming more
difﬁcult for high school seniors to get into
SUNYA'. only one out of eight who apply are
accepted. and next year‘s freshman class will
have an extremely high percentage of Regents
Scholarship winners. more than any other
school in the state except for Cornell. Colum-
bia and perhaps one other.

Sirotkin also points out that students are
having success getting jobs and those going on
for further study are getting into top medical.

probicm.’l‘hc quality of the teaching staff.
Sirotkin says. is extremely good. And then
there is the Cotnmunity Service Program. in
which hundreds of Albany State students are
working in volunteer agencies in the area.

Sirotkin wants to know why there is so
much complaining. it only makes the Univer-
sity look bad to outsiders. and makes some
people think twice before giving the University
more money. A bad reputation harms us
when the legislature is voting on our budget re-
quest. and it hurts the students who graduate
from here. 'l'hcy‘have to live with the Univer-
sity‘s reputation for the rest of their lives.

Well. Mr. Sirotkin. there will always be
complaincrs as long as there is something to
complain about. As long as something needs
improvement. as long as there are weak spots,
there will be people telling you how to do II
better job.

The critics you disparage are not condem-
ning the entire university.They recognize its
strong points. too. But there are some areas in
solid need of improvement. Notably. this in-
cludes the messed up tenure system. as well as
a lack of leadership and dynamism in some of
the upper levels of the administration. So far.
precious little has been done to change these
shortcomings.

We can't be so scared of hanging out some
of the dirty laundry for others to see. That is
the price to pay for self-improvement. which
comcs\onty after thorough self-evaluation.

 

Cbmmner. Services

 To the Editor:

If you aregoing to‘ bee commuting :student

 next year. that doesn't mean that your $64 tax
f money is lost to you. I am running for Central

Council as acommuter..and as your represen-
tative. one of my' major concerns would be to

2 provide as manyfserviees as possible for com-
‘ muters. These services will not only be social
'= functions. but should alsocncompass..those

problems that‘commuting students face with
landlords. transportation. food. etc.

As a commuter representative. communica-
tion poses a special problem. I will always be
available to hear your ideas and complaints.
and will make full use of the bulletin boards

' and newspaper to keep you informed.

Finally. I intend to treat this position with
the serious attitude that it deserves. bearing
always in mind the impact that Central Coun-
cil can have on students‘ lives.

Elections will be held April 23-26 from to
uni. to 4 p m. in the Campus Center. and on
the dinner lines on the quads. i would ap-
preciate your support.

Thank you.

Happiness Is
A Wet Podium

To the Editor:

Once again. the students are getting screw-
ed. Despite the beautiful weather. the foun-
tains are not on. Why not?

Because. according to President Benczet.
“the energy conservation program constrains

us. for nine months of the year. the campus is
our home. Not our home away from home.
but our home.

As it candidate for Central Council from
State Quad. [hereby state my main platform:
more university responsiveness to student
needs. in our present situation. this specifical-
ly means turning the fountains back on—and
at full strength!

If elected. I pledge to attempt to get the un-'

ivcrsity to become more student-need
oriented. This will not result in rhetorical
generalizations. but in solid. tangible ac-
complishments(such as a wet podium).

Curran Stands Alone

To the Editor:

For an SA presidential candidate who has
had to play down the role of current SA of-
ficers in her campaign. it sure was surprising.
and rather unfortunate. to see two of SA's big
leaders suddenly barge into the race and open-
ly announce hat they are behind Ms.
Knibloe‘s candidacy. l'm surprised also that
they thought it necessary. orthat they thought
it proper. in view of the fact that the SA Ex-
ecutive Branch is responsible for running the
elections.

Now the burden is upon Gayle to fully and
publicly explain the part these people have
Played in her campaign. While I respect her
and all the candidates for personally keeping
the campaign "clean." she must now prove
that the has been in charge of her campaign.
and that she can take charge next year, if
elected. Her cndorsers will not be at her side
“W yeﬂfwhcn. and if. for example. students
are told we will have no say in the selection of

The Facts For Wax

To the Editor: This yearweﬁn-that the Vice-
Presidential race is viewed with a signiﬁcance
not previously found in Student Association
elections. The responsibilities of the ofﬁce
have ﬁnally been awarded the attention they
deserve.

Examining the information available. on
each candidate for the Vice Presidency. lhave
used the criterion of each candidate's effec-
livencss as the determinant of who would best
fill the of ficc. Clearly the students need an of-
ficer who can speak on behalf of the students
and have the ability to drive his points home.
A person can have all the good ideas in the
world. but they are worthless unless they can
be Well-conveyed.

Having sat in on numerous Central Council
meetings | feel I can speak accurately on the
candidates‘ efficacy as a representative of the
students. With this in mind. lscc Ken Wax as
being clearly above the other candidates.

Ken Wux‘s views are Well-respected by the
council. l have seen him argue effectively when
tltc majority has accepted an idea because of
its superficial attractiveness. with the result of
conveying the idea‘s negative intracacies to
Central Council. He never speaksjust to hear
himself talk and is looked up to by other
members. This I cannot say ofhis opponents.

He works well with people and is never too
busy to talk ifa question is asked ofhim. lsaw.
as a student on the line. how he helped prevent
violence from breaking out when the ll people
were found at the head of the Miami ticket
line. Although he had the right to stay in the
(‘nmpus Center overnight. he did not exercise
it. and waited with everyone else on the line
outside the Campus Center. | feel it should be
noted that one of his opponents. whose job
was to investigate the entire Miami ticket
problem. came up with a suggestion so un-
workable that Central Council had to reject it.
thereby doing nothing to the people involved.

I would like to close this letter by urging the
election of Ken Wax. Hehas shown. at lcusllo
my satisfaction. the abilities to do a superior
job for the students of this school as Vice
President.

A Chair By Any
Other Name...

To the Editor:

A familiar principle of writingand speaking
is " Never use a long word where a shorter one
will do." Another, urged by Strunk and White.
is “Prefer the standard to the offbeat." Athird
principle. but one oflinguistic understanding.
is "Don‘t confuse writing with speech."

Let us examine chairperson in light of these
principles. It is longer than chairman. It is a
ncologism. while chairman is the standard
form. And the use of chairperson suggests that
the user is confused between speech and
writing: The suffix -manis unstressed and the
vowel makes it rhyme with [um in the speech
of many. the noun "man." however. is stress.
usually rhymes with fan, and in many of its
uses refers to male. But -man is an agenttve
suffix that need not refer to one of the sexes:

A Birnbaum In
The Hand

| wish to announce my support of the can-
didacy of Ira Birnbaum for S.A. Vice Presi-
dent. lra Birnbaum is presently a member of
Central Council. Last year he was President
of Alumni Quad Board and as such I believe
he has a strong sensitivity to the needs of the
campus outcasts — Alumni Quad residents
and commuters. He has shown a strong in-
terest in all aspects of Student Association.

Ira Birnbaum has been one of the most in-
volved and eager to learn members of Central
Council .He has also been the Council member
who has asked me the most questions this
year. There have been many times this year
when he has fought against the Executive
branch but it has almost always been based on
some facts. He has made some mistakes. but
I‘ve made quite a few myself.

Ira is very good with people. It‘s amazing
the number ofpeople he knowsand who know
him on Alumni Quad. He takes responsibility
very seriously. I believe that he is the best can-
didate running and I hope most students will
cast their votes for lru Birnbaum for Vice
President on April 23 — 26.

As a cancer patient. I address myself to

problems if we were united us a community.

Wookiye’s Charm

lo the Editor:

This is in regard to Hal Malrnud s column.
Wookiye. I wish to commend him first on his
lurch article. that ofTuesday. April 2. Ifound
that as this was the first ol‘the series to contain
primarily Mr. Malmud‘s own words.lit was by
'l'arthc most revealing and most powerful he
has written. It is true that the majority of us
will read his article sittingcomlortable in our
freshly painted suites. excl-aim about the
tragedy. and then proceed to the Rathskellcr

fora beer. Yes. increasingthc awareness of the
general public is a step in the right direction.
and ladmire Mr. Malmud greatly for making
even this small advance. [empathize with him
in the dispair he experiences at seeing a Peo-
ple. his People. needlessly destroyed by other
human beings. while the world passively
watches and criticizes. yet condoncs by
silence. i only wish. Mr. Malmud. in your
appeal to us. the students. instead of merely
raising our guilt at our own oblivion and inac-

_ tivity. you would offer some suggestions as to

what we here at Albany State min possibly do

to alleviate this and other similar situations. If
in'your article you Would have provided some

concrete suggestions for action one could

take. I know that I. for one. would respond.

and I believe that there are others among us ‘
also who if they knew what to do would not

allow this attrocity to continue. What are the

alternatives? If you believe letters to the

governments of these countries. or possible to

powers in our own nation would be beneficial.

please provide names and addresses. lam sure

that a student demonstration in Albany. New

York would have very little effect on the

governmentsol lira/ii or l’cru. What can a stu-

dent at a university such as this at this point of

his or her lift: realistically do“! You have open-

ed our eyes Mr. Mulmud.can you now suggest

a path to amelioration of the vision?
