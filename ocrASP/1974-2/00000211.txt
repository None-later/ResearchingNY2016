i- Iewingi , ndia harmonic concept of
Our Mother Earth and all Her Creatures. we
feel this is an ideal time to have these people
stay with us. ,

An ancient Iroquois tradition tells of. the
White Roots of Peace spreading in four direc-
tions from the Great Tree. symbolizing the
ﬁrst United Nations the world ever knew. Un-
der the [Tree of Great Peace. the People of the

longhouse gathered almost a thousand years
ago-and the White Roots went out to provide
a path by which all peoples could'find their
way to peace in the shade of the Great Tree.
The Iroquois People have always con-
sidered an aggressive “pursuit of peace" to be
their mission. In September. I969, a group of
young Mohawks set out to renew their com-
mitment to these traditions. They adopted the
name White Roots of Peace. Since then they
havejoined Peoples of other Indian Nations in
their quest for thelspread of peace and bar-
mony.
Members of the group have participated in.
or observed.such eventsas the Trail of Broken
‘ 'l'rcaties. Wounded Knee. and the Traditional ’
Indian Unity Caravan. For non-Indians, ex-
posure to this group is an important counter-
point to the stereotypes and non-Indian view-
points of some of the media. Their work is to-

 
     

this. all funds go to. the work of com-
municationi. publishing. and service activities
within the Indian community. Most of this
work isdone on or throngs the Mohawk
Reserve at Alrwesasiie on the St. Lawrence
River.

The day‘sactivities will include an all Indian
ﬁlm festival. arts. crafts. and book display,
continuing seminars locatul in the tipi on the
grassy area behind the Campus Center. a
“Meet the Press” type of conference at 2:30 in
the afternoon. photo displays in the Art
Gallery and the Campus Center, and
videotapes of Wounded Knee. also in the CC.
The day's events will culminate in a social
gathering that evening. with dancing. 'music.
etc. Everyone isencourapd lo bring their own.
although refreshments may be served.
Everyone is urged to attend as many activities
as possible. Programs listing the exact times
and locations'of all the events will be available
in the Campus Center.

,‘I’here on also be adisplay by TheSpirit of

LGood Mé‘dicine. an independent study group

here on campus. which will be located in the
main floor showcase of the library. This group
is dedicated to initiating a Native American
Studies Program here at this university.

way as to 't see thin. as lil'ack‘and white I

' have made an 'el‘l‘ortiiiot' to divide the world
>- into black people and  people, becaus’el
have known whites who, possess “soul” and

black-people who-would call me “brother” for
.a dime. I have tried not to see individuals as
right w' gersﬁor left wingers'because there are

people in he l‘left”  are'committed to

 

h nothingl'mor’e than  superﬁcial vanity.

while there exist'conservative individuals who

i . hive proved that they care for humanity and

the problem mankind faces. I bah come to
if test looking at people as intelligent or bor-
ing because so often my own stupidity has
produced totally incorrect conclusions.

So when a group of “women” get together
for a weekend to: expoit a biological distinc-
tion. to assume that life is little more than a.
coniinuingstruggle between man and woman,
and furthermore. that men. by their very
nature force women into a role that is
dehumanizing, degrading, and debilitating, I
'fail to comprehend much of their purpose.

Of course growingup as a male in society
that cherishes its masculinity. does little to ad-
vance maleconsciousness. In that respect
women have an obligation to impress upon
men and women the fact that society‘s chastity
belt is just another form of repression.

Women are not the only ones victimized by

 

society‘smacltismetrip.Snare men We are rais-

ed by our male fathersand female mothersio be

" I have earda woman (who happens to'be my
‘molherl on countless occasions stress that my
" sister-did not require as much schooling as
myself because she‘was a girl and 'she would
Ifind herself a husband. There are many men
' who would love to kis their male friends on the
cheeks. cry in front of their girlfriends. feel
submissive and protected. yet can not because
they were brought up with norms that dis-
couraged ‘sueh reactions. While some may
assume these reactions to be feminine, they are
1 nothing more than human responses,

  
 

What results is a certain ambiguity on my
part developing out of some cultured male
prejudice. Many “women Iibbers" are
arrogant people who disguise their own per-
sonal insecurities for pride. Other' .“Women'
libbers“ are intelligent. sensitive. human
beings. proud of their femininity. aware of
their potential. striving. not competing. and
involved in the politics of a genuine revolution
to change men and their absurd demands
upon women.

And then there are those women who are
not "women libbers" or “radical feminists“.
but just the other half of humanity. They are
students and mothers, doctors and accoun-
tants.social workers and waitresses and they
achieve anything their struggle leads them to.
They do not have to demand recognition
because their warmth. intelligence, and sen-
sitivity rewards them with ample respect from
us “boys.”
