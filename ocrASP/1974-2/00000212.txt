Albany mishaps. lwa me’zedtos'ee
I concert] '
SUNYA movie scene with all the'
filingstopl. There were' many strange
thirty-going ,on both in the crowd
andvbehind the scenes.

To start, a bluegrass band from

‘ lthacatknown as Country Cooking

came on:_, looking very much like

_ Cornell dropouts. With a banjo

:-player who also played guitar, a

mandolin player, accoustic guitar,
‘electric bass. and a female vocalist,
'the band was quite full sounding and

pleasing to the ear. They played a
number of good tunes and the
crowd. which was packed in the CC

‘ ballroom. enjoyed their music. The
group seemed to get into the crowd
spirit as much as those attending.

' The female vocalist.'whose name es-
capes me (as do the rest' of the band
members names), was a country girl

V from Colorado. Her allusions to a
certain Guru and her being “into the

lord“ drew mixed reactions from,

' some of the more vocal elements in

’g thel front rows, who were rather

wrecked. In spite of cat —— calls all
went well and it seems that

- Bluegrass has ﬁnally taken a firm

standing in the Albany area.

After Country Cooking the crowd
was primed for Commander Cody.
With the "sweet smell of Spring“ in
the air both in the crowd and
backstage. eve;yone..was ready for
the beer and boogie as promised in
the advertising proceeding the con-
cert. Commander Cody and his
seven musicians seemed quite relax-
ed waiting upstairs in the lounge. l
was really surprised they could walk
onto the stage with enough relaxers

. in them to stop an army. They must
all have very hardy constitutions,
although one band member did
remark to me that he can‘t drink
orange soda anymore.

‘ After getting on the stage and
playing for approximately one
minute the band was dismayed to

, into a typical. .

_ fuIe.. ,Whilefaftte‘rnptsjvnre
made torepair the voice mikes. the
commander did jumping — jacks
withhis lead guitarist Bill Kirch‘en.
Everyone. drank beer (well, . not

I everyone) and tried to take the mis-

hap in stride. When it became evi-
dent that the repairs would take
more than a few minutes, Ernie
Hagar (a new band member) played
a very beautiful instrumental version
of “BlueMoon”. on his peddle steel
guitar. The rest of the band joined in
and the crowd became very pleased
and appeased. After the song,
everyone just milled around and did
what you do while waiting for the
show to go on.lv Commander Cody
asked me if this was typical of the
school and I had to admit that these
little accidents happen all the time. I
said the concert would have been
more suited to the Palace Theatre
downtown and after explaining the
situation as best lcould (which was
minimally) he agreed.

It took about 25 minutes to get.
things going again. and after a short
jam which returned the crowd to it‘s
senses, the show went on. The first
number was a rocker which had a
fine electric ﬁddle part by Andy
Stein and an equally fine guitar run
for Billy Farlow. The second
number which was a truck driver
tune appropriately labeled “Truckin
and Fuckin" featured Andy Stein on
Sax. After this the band showed its
tightness by doing “Wine Wine
Wine“ which was good clean country
music. After a forth number, which I
have completely forgotten, for some
reason. the group did “Momma
Tried“ a Dead song which went over
very well.

A very notable tune was “When
the Sun Sets on the Sea“ from their
album Live From Deep in the Heart
of Texas. The song had a whistling
duet in the middle which I found ex-
ceptional. After this the group turn-
cd to boogie with a tune called “Oh
my my“ (nothing to do with Ringo‘s
Album). This song featured The
Commander on piano. The next two
songs got the crowd swaying andjust
as things started lto move the con-
ccrt's second bummer occurcd. At

due to those'samernylterio I

trial problems. The pooricom-
mander was sotrustrated that he left
the stage in a half and was im-
mediately brought down from his in-
creasing high. (Bummer Bummer)

The rest of théhand followed suit.

The crowd again was patient, and
fairly Quiet which is unusual at any

concoct wherea mishapocctuﬂeto ‘

'peeted booting and howling the se-

‘ éond time and everyone tried to get

back into the high spirits. Thirty
minutes later just as the group was
ready to leave. the problem was solv-
ed. The band. about halfway out the
door. decided the crowd deserved a
good concert and even though the
school was responsible for all the
trouble, they went back on to try
again.

As they made their thrid com-
eback I could tell the group was
eager to please everyone. They did
their best from the llth to the 25th.
A very different type of song forthe
Commander's band was “No count
blues“ which featured alot ofbrass in
a Dixieland — Big Swingbnnd
sound. The audience found this
quite enjoyable. Also included in the
last set were a few truck —— driving
numbers. rock and roll. country
western. and even a Cajun tune
called "Diggy liggy to" from their
Hot Licks and Trucker Favorites
album.

The group (band and audience)
really got back in the spirit ofthings
with the Beachboys song “Riot goin
on.“ With Bruce Barlow on bass.
Lance Dickerson on drums. and
John 'l‘ichy on rhythm guitar the
path was clcarcd for “Hot rod Lin-
coln.“ This was perhaps the peak of
the evening with everyone on their
feet boogicing. Aftcrthis came “Too
tnuch fun." “Not in this club.“ and
finally "Jailhouse rock." which kept
all involved happy. The group ex-
ited with the Commander smiling
andafter a few minutes of applause

‘and burning matches. they came

back for an encore. This is when the
ultimate bummer of the evening oc-
:ured.

As the first note ofthcencore was
played there was a sharp crackle, a
pop (no snap). and the power went
off again. With a look of total dis-
gust. the Commander left the stage
muttering “This is where I get off."
Even the crowd was ready to leave at
that point and exited orderly. tlp-
stairs I had a chance to share the
band‘s disgust for a while. The Com-
mander felt the crowd got ripped ~--
off because they paid to see It show,
really got into it. and then got burn-
ed. Everyone tried to joke. about it
but it was a lost cause. -

If anyone wants to hear the group
in the near future. they will be play-
ing at the Academy of Music in NYC

= on May 25. I assure you that the

sound system there won‘t be turned

' off due to electrical problems.

Elvin Jones. long-lime musical
associate of ‘trane and drummer
extra-ordinare returned to town last
week for four days of performances.
Last Wednesday night Elvin played
in ft free concert at the Albany Coun-
ty Jail. something he has been doing
f‘or‘quite some time now. Elvin. one
of the most personable and feeling
artists I have ever had the pleasure to
have met. realizes the great need for
people to betrcated humanely. Elvin
cares for the minds society has lock-
ed hchind its bars. many through no
fault of their own. He realizes society
owes these men and women so much.
so he willingly devotes part of his
time to public institutions out of" the
kindness of his heart. Few musicians
devote as large amounts of their time
and energy as Elvin Jones docs. for
be ically feels the need.

Elvin Jones is a for real person.

 Thursday. Friday. and Saturday

nights Elvin .loncs with group SlcVC
(irossman. reeds (four years with
Elvin): Roland I’rincc. guitarist
(with Elvin since January); and .lim-
my Garrison. bass violin (long. long
time musical companion of Elvin)
performed at the Last Chance
Saloon.

Elvin's playing was not quite as
good as he is known to have been iii
the past. the best. it seems due to

(ZNS) During Deep l’urplc‘s set at
the California jam rock festival
Saturday. guitarist Ritcltic
lilttcltmorc had managed to destroy
an amplifier and a loudspeaker by
bringing it with his guitar. He then
proceeded to slam the instrument
against a television camera as hard
till he could.

Instead of getting freaked out. all
of the t.v. technicith just smiled.
The festival was financed by A.ll.C.
and Ritchie lilackmorc's act had
been planned well in advance.

The California jam rock festival
marked the first attempt by a mttjor
corporation to promote a big out-
door rock festival, and A.ll.C. gross-
ed an estimated two million dollars
from about two hundred thousand
luns. 'l'ltcre were very few successful
gttte crttsltcrs and the crowd was
generally peaceful and stonctl.

some very pressing personal
problems. Elvin is a man who is very
emotional and feeling. Elvin .duc to
fatigue. pressure and l guessjust out
of the desire to be as loose as possible
for the show was a hit “jammed up“
when he appeared onstage.

lilvin‘s playing was affected
noticeably but Elvin never lost his
"cool." lilvin. in a noticeably rcdftc~
cd capacity to play. still out-ranked
the greater nu mbcr ol'jtw/ drummers
in the world. When he got rolling.
lein was smoking with his inventive
genius in full control of the sets.

Elvin as is they have been together

credit to IllCSt.‘ two buddies. Jones

Iilvin. who was "out there,“ still
managed to pluysomc fine solos. but

noticeably Elvin was a bit slowed
due to his own fair share of drink.

You know. if any other performer
ever did some of the things Elvin did
this weekend I think that most ofthc
bar patrons Would have been in-
furiated. liut with Elvin it really
didn‘t matter for most what his cott-
dition was. lilvin demanded respect
and he received it. When one realizes
the humanitarian nature of Elvin
.loncs all we have to think isthatthis
man cares. lﬁlvin remembers people.
