V ’I. guess reporters are always looking for different angles for stories.
Because] come from-New York City. I am accustomed to the loud

_ city sports fans. They have been labeled by many as the best fans in

V the country. The Knick, fans . _ think they are almost a part of
the team. With this in mind. I decided to see how the other half roots.
as I ventured up to Montreal to see the Expos play the Mets. Four
classes didn‘t stop me‘ and my suitemate from attending last
Wednesday‘s game.

Montrealis a long four hour drive, directly up the‘northway. It‘s a

pretty. simple trip until we started looking for the Expo’s ballpark. I

' am still not exactlylsure where Jarcy Park is located. as we managed
to get ourselves lost going to and from the ballpark. Asking directions
didn‘t help either. We pulled into a gas station and were directed to
Jarry Park in French. The trouble with that, though isthat neither of
us could understand any French.

We ﬁnally found someone who could speak English. and they
directed us to .larry Street, which lead us to the ballpark. lguest thatls
what they call it. After comparing it to both Yankeee and Shea
stadium. it looked like a minor league ball park. Its that small the
ballpark seats under thirty-thousand. Jarry Park did have a special
charm. Because there is only one deck, all of the fans are right in the
middle of the action; The ballplayers don‘t have to worry about any
shadows from the stands. Its also a refreshing change from the new

modern. standardized ballpark. _ , . .
We took our s‘eatsbehind home plate and Istarted observmg the at-

mospherc in the ball park. The first difference I noticed came from
the public address announcer. All of the announcements are made
first in French and then in English. It sounded like an echo and it took
some time to get used to. We also spent most of the day trying to
decipher the French writing on the scoreboard.

I found the fans in Montreal to be just as enthusiastic asthe fans in
the city. They love their baseball and they pack Jarry Park to see their
team play. They are even more excited now because the Expos are in
first place. They cheered all of their players on. but I was very supris-
cd to their reaction to Willie Davis. He was playing in only his second
home game at Montreal but still the crowd would be on its feet and
applauding. as soon as his name was mentioned. The fans think he‘s
the man that is going to lead Montreal to a pennant.

They still serve hotdogs and hamburgers in Montreal‘s consession

stands but I spent the entire game looking for some ice cream. though
I never found any. Theyalso havetral’l‘icjams after the ballgamc.just
like NYC.
- There was one big difference between the New York fan and his
counter part in Montreal. In the city the opposing team will constant-
ly be booed. It‘s a rare occasion when a player of the opposition is
cheered. In Montreal. the fans basically keep quiet when the op-
posing team is up and they even cheer for an outstanding perfor-
mance. In the game. the Met‘s Dave Schneck hit his second homerun
of the game in the ninth inning As he circled the bases. the fans seem-
ed a little in shock from the blast, but they soon rose to their feet and
gave him a standing ovation.

Journey“ to ,O'Iweso on Saturday,

'ppedtvith a smaller team than
ﬁnal, I head coach with a bad cold,
end espeetations of a difﬁcult meet

with both oswego and oneoma

' State Universities.

Yet from the moment Carlo
Cherubino grabbed the lead from
Oswego's Tom Simbox after the first
mile of the meet's ﬁrst event, the six-
mile run, Albany's day. like

‘ ‘.Cherubino's race. became a mere

runaway. The ﬁnal score read
Albany I04. Oswego 49 and Oneon-
ta 36, as Sate picked up its 23rd and

:iAth victories inltt row. .

Cherubino eventually lapped all
his competition in the 24 lap race and
finished with a time of 30 minutes;
2.95 seconds. over a minute and one
half ahead of Simbox. The time
qualified him for the NCAA Divi-
sion III championships. to be held a
month from now in Illinois. Chris
Burns and Eric Jackson took third
and fourth in Saturday‘s ract ot give
Albany a lead of ﬁve points. ‘

That lead grew consistently
throughout the meet as Albany
grabbed ll ﬁrsts and I0 seconds
alone in the III events. Holdingon to
seven yard lead going into the ﬁnal
quarter mile Lap, Langford was
caught by Oswego's Fran Verdoliva

with ju'it myria- to go. He never‘let ‘ .

Verdoliva get away however.  I

Batmen Unimpressive

by Mike lgoe

The Albany baseball team now
stands at 2-5 following back-to-back
losses to RPI on Thursday and Fri-
day and a split of a doubleheader
with Brockport on Saturday.

On Thursday. the batmen blew

a 5-0 lead and went on to drop a 6—5
decision to the Engineers. In the
fourth inning. Jeff Brcglio singled
home two runs to givethe Danesa 2-
0 advantage. The lifth‘ inning saw
Albany put three more runs on the
scoreboard.

Bill Hopkins led off with a walk.
Mark Fuchs advanced him with a
bunt. and was safe at first. Frank
Cnstpldo thcn singled thc l-Ioppcr
home. Fuchs advanced with ll Dave
licnllcy hunt and scored on an Rl’l
crror. ’l'crry Kenny hit a sacrifice lly
to bring Cnstaldo in.

With it 5-I lead after eight innings.
it looked as ifthc Danes were headed
for their first Capital District League
victory of the scttson.

llut along came the disastrous
ninth inning.

Rl’l picked up two runs with a
bases-loaded walk and a single by
Jay Gztrl'inkcl. With the bases still
loaded. up stepped Ron Page who
belted a triple to sew up the victory
for the visitors.

On Friday. the Engincccrs showed
some of that Collar City hospitality
with a (1-2 spnding of the visiting
Danes. The win gave Rl’l n 2-(l mark
in the Capital District League.

In Saturday‘s games. Albany took
the opener 4-3. but dropped the
nightcup.  Ill-8.

Kenny stroked two R Ills and
Brockport errors accounted for
another two runs in the first game.
Once again. though. Albany almost
snatched defeat from the jaws ofvic-
tory.

Coach "Bullet" Bob Burlingame.
who is rapidly becoming ll candidate
for Ripley‘s Believe It Or Not, made
an incredible move.

In the sixth inning with the bases
loaded and one out. the Bullet sent
up pitcher Kevin Quinn to but for
himself in‘place of the designated
hitter. The move told Brockport that
Burlingame was. calling for a hunt.
Steve DeVito was tagged out trying
to come home and Quinn eventually
struck out. Quinn. incidentally. had
not been up to but this spring.

In the four ‘hour nightcup. the
Danes outhit Brockport. I4-9. bl"
still bowed.

After spotting Brockport a 5-I
lead. the Albany batmen erupted for
six runs in the third. Frank
Castttldo‘s three run triple
highlighted the inning. A double by
Steve DcVito and Dan DcForest‘s
single guvc Albany another three
runs.

Brockport got four runs back in
the next inning. however.

The hapless Burlingame let Steve
Bosnk walk in three runs and wild
pitch another in before he saw ﬁt to
make a pitching change. Albany
added another run in the sixth inning
but that was as close as they came.

Brockport IOW leads the
SUNYAC Conference with a 7-3
record while Albany is in second
place with a 6-4 mark.

some weeks ago.

Other sour points to the meet from
Albany’s standpoint. came in the
shot put and the 440 yard relay.
Rudy Vido won the shot put with a
toss of 48 feet. It inches. but he is
still over ﬁve feet behind his best toll
of last year. and bag but three weeks
remaining to qualify for the national
championships.

In the 440 yard relay. Albany
dropped the baton not once. but
twice. during the race. Coach R.
Keith Munscy later quippcd. “We
now have shown that we can drop
the baton gracefully. I feel that this
week we shouldlwork more closely
on handing it off.“

Munsey wants everyone to be at
their best for this Wednesday‘s meet
with Union College. Union has
provenlthemselves to be very solid in
their meets so far this season. and
Albany will be without the services
of Shrader. who ill be running in
the Penn Relays on Thursday in
Philadelphia. ‘

Other performances Saturday cer-
tainly gave reason for encourage-
ment. Perry Hocltzell and Tom

‘Clctlry took one-twu in the javelin.

the high jump and added a 2nd in the
120 yard high hurdles. while Streeter-
grabbed seconds in both the in-
termediate hurdles and the triple

The meet ended as it started. with
an Albany runaway. Bedford, John-
son. Grifﬁn. and Jefson defeated
both OswEgo and Oneonta by over 8
seconds in the Mile Relay to put the
final victory margin at 55. At this
point. Munsey‘s cold was feeling a
lot better. and the coach was already

alking about the tough meet coming
up this Wednesday at home versus
Union.
