“H-Z-O. H-Z-O, H-2-0!“
“We want water, we want water!“
“W—A-T-E-R!"

About one hundred students
shouted these cries yesterday noon
as they gatheredaround the fountain
voicing discontent over the proposed
fountain shutdown for the rest ofthe
year.

Led by Central Council Chairper~
son Eric Lottschein. the group
marched around tlte dry fountain for
about half an hour. About five hun-
dred people watched.

The protests. touched off by ad-
ministration statements that the
Iountains would remain dry for the
rest of the acadentic year because of
the energy crisis. was termed a
success, but the administration had
decided last week to turn the foun-
tains on for the rest of the year.

Contactcd last week by student
l-ttders complaining about the
irrationality of the fountain shut-
down. Assistant to the Executive
Vice-President Justine Davidson
said the cost for turning on tltc foun-
Ittitts would be $l0.000 a season for
24 hour flow. and about $5.000 a
season for the l4 hour flow they are

I ttow planning. She said fountains

would be turnede from it am. to lo
p.m. at least until commencement.

toting ends today at 7 P.Mi

Because of plumbing problems,
fountains will not be on until next
'l'uesday. One of the state workers

said a main leak would cause
flooding in the bowling alleys
downstairs in the Campus Center.

With pctitiontcirculated. students
picketing and water balloons
thrown. the protest climaxed with
Lonschein reading the ad—
ministration‘s answer to the student
actions. '

The letter. from John Hartley.
Vice-President of Management and
Planning to Walter Tisdale. acting
head of Campus Planning. cited the
administration‘s decisions for foun-
tains “Weighing the effects of the
fountains on the spirit ofthecampus
against the energy saved by leaving
them dormant. my judgement isthat
the settles tip heavily to turningtliem
on. I think they should be on front
about It tt.m. to It) p.m. at least until
commencement."

‘l'hc administration says they are
also planning to put some colorful
chairs and tables around the fourt-
tain this spring.

On hearing of the furtherdelays of
actually turning on the fountains.
the protesters vowed to return to the
fountain on Tuesday. planning to
detnonstute unless the fountains are
tlowing.

There was a voting machine. too.

Student Association elections
took second place to the Indian

Nevertheless. people still wandered
over to vote. ask questions and even
to make sure that it wasn't part ofthe
larger display.

In sotne ways. it would have made
a better display. Ii t-rything about
the polling area seemed to defy
mechanics and sophistication until it
took on the aura ol'somc small town
election in whichall is casual. slow-
paeed and common sense ultimately
wins out.

()n the table. along with the
bttllots and buttons. were piles of
shredded. yellow paper. A poll-
watcher explained that each voter
had to have one before entering the
voting machine in order to make
sure “no one sneaks in from the
side." It sounded good-almost like
the sheriff protecting the people
from the one dishonest lout among
them. the fact that anyone could
shred up their'own yellow paper did
enter into one‘s mind-but it was
tempered by the idea that the most
advanced techniques haven‘t been
too good at preventing corruption.

was really do-it-yourself. From

stuffing it in the natural wood ballot

 

Local Men A rrested

by Nlney Alb-ugh

Campus Security arrested six
local Albany men. all non-students.
this week in two separate and ap-
parently unrelated incidents both on
Indian Quad.

The first arrests were Tuesday
evening as Security detained four
blacks who had left the Quad after
allegedly harassing a student. A
loaded.22-ealibre revolverwas found
in the rented car they drove. '

Arrested were William M.
Nuness. 23. of 778 Livingston
Avenue. Albany; Wayne Lee Brace.

MaGuire Avenue. Albany; and
Milton Clark'. l8. l35 Northern
Boulevard. Albany. All four were
charged with posse'ion of a
dangerous Weapon—a class D
lelouy. and trespassing---a violation.

After Quad residents phoned
descriptions of the car to Security.
Security stopped the four between
Dutch and Indian Quads. As crowds
from an on-going softball game
stopped and watched. Security. frisk-
ed the tnctt.

One witness said. “They had the
guys spread-ettgled over the Plum
they were driving. I didn‘t know
Security was that effective."

l'ltc arresting officers were Lt.
David l’rcdergasl and Investigator

lJohn .l. Ruth.

The four were arraigned in Police
Court Wednesday. but the Clerk‘s
Office would give no information

 

about bail. No date for the trial was
set at that time.

The other incident occt‘trred
Wednesday night just after ten p.m.
Residence staff members called
Security when they noticed two
"suspicious" men walking into 4+2.
Security stopped and arrested the
blacks. one of whom carried a load-
ed "Saturday Night Special."

The voting machine tiled ‘for the
more important election 'was a

testimonial to the unreliability of '

automation. “The first one broke so
we had to take this one from the
English department elections." and
the irresponsibility of the student
voter. “I forgot all about voting for
the amendments." Those under
eighteen along with the absentee
ballot devotees gave themselves
away by their inability to figure out
the Workings ol'this mysterious unit.
Ihe poll watchers though. one of.

calm . paternttl and helpful.
