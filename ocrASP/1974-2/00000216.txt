. Introduces Fountain Bill ,

Senate Votes To

by Kurt Zorn,

After a late start because
members had to go to a different
meeting koom. University Senate got
down to business last Monday after:
noon.

Senator Lonschein requested a
suspension of the agenda. Since
there were no objections. Chairper—
son' Cobane agreed. Lonschein
proceeded to introduce a bill co-
sponsored by some fifteen-odd
senators requesting that the foun-
tains be turned on thi) spring on a
regular basis rather than a “special-
event-only" basis.

Basically there was no opposition
to the bill. other than questions con-
ceming the con in money and energy
incurred by the running of the foun-
tains. President Benezet. unable to
answer these questions. promised to
have the necessary information for
the next Senate meeting.

Getting back to the agenda. a bill
was introduced by the Executive
Committee asking for a change in
the composition of the Graduate
Academic Council so that it could
act as a research review body to
replace and take on some of the
duties of the defunct research review
committee.

. Finally. the Senate strongly
defeated a bill which wouldrnovelbe‘,
last daytodrop classes. ltadvocated
that ‘...the grade of "W" will be
assigned... for a course dropped on
or before the last day ofclas'ses of the
ninth week of the term." This con-
trasts with the present policy of
allowing students to drop claues
through the next to last week ,of
classes.

David Hirsch. a graduate student
in the Senate led the floor fight

'agaiuttt the proposed change in the
”W"~grading procedure. Hirsch said
that the proponents of the bill

Keep Drop Date

drop courses back to the ninth week
of the semester would provide a
“kick in the butt" for students to.

He said that DeWitt Elinwood.
the leading proponent. claimed that
students tend to panic toward the
end ‘of the ysemesterr as the backlog
of work seems to pile up and cause
students to drop courses that they
really shouldn‘t have dropped.

Hirsch countered that a deadline
of nine weeks into the semester is far
too early for a student to judge their
status in the class.

It was a lean. tall Texan with adis~

mounted the steps to the stage of
Campus Center Ballroom yesterday
to deliver to a patient press and a
capacity audience his message of
redemption to the nation in general
and New York State in particular.

Clark appeared with Allard
Lowenstcin. the most vocal non-
dccltired Senatorial candidate in re-
ccnt political history. The two were
originally supposed to appear in a
debate forum but at the last minute.
the New Democratic Coalition. the
group sponsoring the event. changed
the style to that oftt straight press in-

Musicouncil Budget Cut Two-Thirds

by Andrew I’alley and David Lerner

Central Council. duringitsannual
budget review voted to cut the
Musicouncil budget to $3.000.“
decrease of almost $6.000 from its
budgetary appropriations of last
year.

Council took all the money from
the programming line with the Sim
plc result that Musicouncil will be
unable loprovidc any classical music
concerts at all next year by outside
groups. Council specified that the
$3.000 be used for l-‘rec Music Store
and Contact only.

Council justified its action by
inserting that Musicouncil had
sqttttltdct'cd vast sums of money on
unsuccessful programming during
the year. and therefore could not be
trusted with such a large appropria-
tion.

in addition, the Albany arch is
relatively short ol poptllttr music

In reference to the recent murders

“What kind of people are we" when
we send out police in an indiscrimatc
search for criminals.

concerts and Council. according to
members of Musicouncil. wanted to
use its money on areas that would
reach the roost students. thereby
justifying the emphasis on popular

concerts at the apparent expense of

classical music.

Council members purportedly
claimed that the attendance record

at classical concerts was notoriously

poor. and that the benefits of
classical concerts didn't even reach
students interested in thc classics.

Council apparently feels that the
necessary money for classical music
should conic front other sources.
primarily the Administration. The
seeming lack of sympathy for the
concerns of classically oriented
students is representative evidence of
general student non-support for this
type of cultural activities.

l he possibility of losing ground in
the area of community t'clulionsttlso
is quite high. l'ltc Musicouncil con-

said. “.Iavits said he Welcomes thocn-

few lhlli’do turn out to concerts.
malty are local Albany residents who
find thcsc “S the only direct connec-
tion tothcmussivc education institu-
tion that drains them of tax dollars.
the loss of these concerts could
further polttrizc thecontmunity from
the University.

Council recommended to the
Musicouncil representatives that
they compensate for tire loss by urg-
ing the faculty to provide more pet'-
I‘ormtrnccs for the students.
Musicouncil replied that such a rc-
quest would be an insult to an;
already ovcrburdcncd faculty. and
would defeat the aim of the group.
which is to provide talent that might
otherwise not be heard by the
students.

Music critics noted that the
SUNYA music faculty is not pur-
ticulnrly strong in the strings or brass
quartet liclds. l'ltcy pointed out too
Council that was not quite llS versed
in the liner points of music that tltc
only way lor someone to hear really
fine Beethoven. for example. would
be to travel to New York.

Finally. Council argued that
‘Clussicul music is not a money-
mnking proposition."

Council's action may have an
ellcct of establishing a priority
towards wlutt type of culture it
deems to be rclcvent to student in-
tercsts.

David Coyne. one of the members
of ‘the Executive Branch Budget
Committee. the group charged with
the responsibilityofdrawingupeach
year‘s budget. had agreed witli the
Committee‘s rccom'mcndution to cut
Musicouncil‘s appropriation. “It
cost between EIS and $25 per ticket
per student to the Student Associa-
tion to subsidilc these concerts." he
said.

"the Allmun concert cost S.A.
about Sit) per ticket per student."
The Allmun concert is generally con-
sidered mm of the most adven-
turesonic expeditions into music
that SA has ever attempted. especial-
ly one that was a large m‘oney loser.
