The City of Albany is preparing to
enact a new and stiffer zoning law
which will affect students living in
rented apartments. The city‘s Cor-
poration Council office is now
preparing a bill which will be in-
troduced at the next Common
Council meeting on May 6. The con-
tent of this bill has not yet been made
public. but it is cxpected~to provide
that the city shall have the authority.
to evict students and others who live
in rented singlc-family dwellings if
more than two unrelated people are
living together.

The impact of the measure on
students living off campus is poten-
tially that the city will have the
power to break up arty apartment
where more titan two reside.
Although much like present laws.
the new proposal would bring the
city‘s ordinancus up to date and
would give the Bureau of Code En-
forcement the power to take actiott
against offenders. However. the new
law should not be as drastic in effect
as to prevent all groups of students
from living together. In fact. accor-
ding to Joseph A. Scaring, Director
ol ()l'l-Campus l-lousingatSUNYA.
enlorcement of the law will not be

stringent. but . rather" limited to
speciﬁc cases where complaints from
neighborhuod residents are made.
The complaints are usually of ,ex-
cessive noise. crowded parking
spaces. or other such nuisances to
the permanent non-student residents
living near student apartments. Non-
etheless. the housing 'ofl'tce is
attempting to alert all off-campus
students as well as their landlords to

“the pending city ordinances. says

Scaring.""‘-» . M

The action of the Common Coun-
cil follows a ruling by the U.S.
Supreme Court on April I that the
group renting law of the town of
llclle 'l‘crrc. Long Island, was con-
stitutional. The town‘s ordinance
allows an unmarried couple to
eohabit a dwelling but prohibits any
more than two people from living
together. The Supreme Court ruled
7-2 that llcllc ‘l‘erre had the right to
use its police powers for more than
just the “elimination of filth, stench.
and unhealthy places.“ .Ittstice
William 0. Douglas wrote the ma-
jority opinion for the court. This ac-
lion. opened the way for other
municipalities, like Albany. to
follow suit in banning such group
living.

Women’s Rights Bill Passes

ALBANY. NY. (Al’) - A propos-
ed constitutional amendment that
would outlaw discrimination against
women in state and loutl laws was
approved by the Assembly Wednes—
day.

the measure is aimed particularly
at laws involving insurance. banking
and estate cases. said
Assemblywoman Constance E.
Cook, R-lthaca.

I'Ite measure must be approved by
the Senate and passed by the
legislature next year before it could
put to a stale referendum in the fall
of I975.

“These laws no longer dis-
criminate expressly, but there may
he built-in discrimination.“ said
Mrs. Cook. the prime sponsor ofthc
bill.

“This would change the weight of
the burden of proving a dis-
criminatory common law.“

She added that the constitutional
amendment would. in effect. give
women all the rigltts men have under
the state constitution

The bill would have the same
effect as the equal rightsamendtucnt
that must be approved by 38 state
legislatures to become part of the
federal constitution. The 'an‘tendr

tnent has been approved in 33 states.
including New York. but two state:
have repealed their approval.

After the bill was passed Bil—4.
Mrs. Cook headed for the speaker's
rostrum where she presided over the
Assembly. the first woman to do so
in seven years. .

“Women should have exactly the
same break in life that men have.“
Assemblyman William M.
Steinfcldt, R-Rochcstcr. said during
the short debate on the bill.

Miss (iunning said she saw
nothing wrong with women being
drafted for military service.

“C on gress can draft women
tomorrow if it wishes to do so.“ she
said. “We would not have had this
country if the pioneer women had
not stood with their guns next to
their husbands." \

the ordinance non/being «I
up by the Corporation Council is the

type of law which groups such as the ‘

Pine Hills Association have been
pressuring the city to pass. according
to Scaring. But pressure against such
laws exists too. he says—from
‘ landlords who stand to lose revenue
due to the decreased occupancy
which the law would mandate.

There have been in the past a few
major court battles between the
landlords and the city housing
authorities. ()Itc bout culminated in
a win for the landlords in Federal
Court. when a group of IS landlords
successfully maintained that the city
ordinance imposed against their ren-
ting to groups of people was un-
constitutiomtl. In September I972
Judge James I. Foley declared the
challenged portion ofthc statute per-
taining to multiple rentals was un-
constitutional and granted an in‘

junction against its enforcement. ‘

l'he city at that time failed to appear
or submit papers to back its position.
This decision prohibited any further
civil or criminal proceeding to en-
force the ordinance in R-2 or lt-3
districts which banned group living.
l‘hc recent Supreme Court ruling
has now overruled this decision.

Student housing In Albany resident

A

Iel nborhooda. such ea th a '

on Mercer Sh. would be threatened by the proposed houslng ordlnenee.

Current Albany zoning luw.
amended in I969. prohibits renting
apartments to groups which do not
constitute a family. and defines a
family as “one or more persons ofthc
same lineage or related by Irrgpge
oecttpying a premise an “Io/ling

together as a single housekeeper
unit: said family shall include foster
children.“

The housing bill is expected to
pass the Common Council. after it is
introduced at the upcoming May (a
meeting.
