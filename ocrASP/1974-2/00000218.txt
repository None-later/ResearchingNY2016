more than 45 days (which eliminates
the excursion fare). take a GIT. If

If you know a little about bikes.
you might consider buying one
yourself in the city you land and tak-
ingoff on your own. Most European
bikes are vastly superior to
American bikes for touring. so you
an be fairly sure of getting a good
one for about Sl00. In general a
touring bike should have (I) frame
joints connected by lugs or sleeves.
(2) total weight not exceeding 32
pounds. and (3) a wide range of gears
for easier hill — climbing.

For more information on bikes
and their are. look through a good
book like Eugene Sloan‘s The Com-
plete Bfr_l‘€fl$f or Eierybody‘s Bike
Book by Tom Cuthbertson.

You can get touring information
from AYH orthe International Bicy-
clc Touring Society. 846 Prospect
Street. La Jolla. CA 92037. In addi-
tion. the Hallwag ro Michelin road
maps will ensure that. whether
hitching or biking. you don‘t end up
on a road to nowhere unless you
want to.

If you want to hit many different
countries. but have limited time and
money. a student Eurail pass is
probably your best bet. These
passes. available only to certiﬁed full
time students. will let you'travel st:-
cond class through Western Europe
(excluding Britain) for two months
for S I 65. This pass will easily pay for
itself; for instance the rail fare from
Paris to northegn Norway and back
is about the cosf of the pass. Also
you can save on lodging by taking
overnight trains.

First class Eurail passes (open to

non -— students) cost SISU for 2| '

days. $190 for one month. $260 for
two months and .5300 for three
months. Children aged 4 — I2 ridc
half fare. Britrail passes tor British

Mia 22 — $45 for lSdays orStiSIor
one month. Both Eurdil and Britrail
passes must be bought before you
leave; you can predate the passes for
whenever you want them'to take
effect. Travel agents should have
applications for both passes. or you
can write the German Federal

Jobs in Europe are not as plentiful
asthey once were. but if your only
goal is to meet living expenses and;
not make money or even air fare
home. there is still exciting sweaty
work to be bad.

France for $6 —— 7 a day. room and

The International Personnel Pool

usually as camp workers —
litcguurds. rcccptionists. baby —

you apply once you‘re in Europe and
that you pay a SIU placement fee.
