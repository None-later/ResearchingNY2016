Schizophren

by Bob Rledlnget‘

Jun Akkerman. guitarist from the
Dutch rock group Focus. has
presented the music world with tin
albutn ol‘ striking schizophrenia.

Fortunately in ltis ettse it isn‘t an il-

lncss. it‘s just his way of handling '

what he likes. 0n 'I'a/wrttukt'ltAtco

SI) 7032). Akkcrman taps the
musical resources of l) ttte
lili/ahethan period and 2) rock. ltut
don‘t. get any ideas abottt
lzli/abethan Rock becoming the
next craze. Akkermau keeps the two
forms almost completely segregated
as it he wanted to consciously avoid
the synthesis tendency of groups like
Emmi)“- l.akc. and Palmer. and still
be able to record ottoncalbum
the music that keeps him practicing
ten hours a day when he's not on
tour. Whether or not the album
\torks depends on your listening

(\kk‘crman's approach to his
classical gttitur sectns a bit heavy-
hantletl lor someone whose only
gttitar idol isclassical virtuosoJulian
llreum. Occasionally the strings
sound :Is it the) are being gougctl.
Whether tltis is an accidental carry-
over [ruin his tliggings into rock
music or a subtle antl unique way of
tuning idioms is not certain. lledoes
c\|ttbtt cnthttsiasm lot‘ the material
though. and desettes that credit.

«\kkerman's itttcrest itt lhth cen-
tury music is represented here in
works by |)o\\|and one of the
greatest composers l'or lute. and

llalborne. ttnd Morely. among
others. Dig land's “Britannia.” a
rather sprightly gait. opens the
albutn. the song begins with a solo
lute sttttcntent l'rom Akkcrman
which is eventually embellished and
carried by time. brass. bass. and
drttms.

Another Dowland piece. ‘A
Gallium“ is a short but exuberant
ltttc solo. the other classical lttte
songs. however. are somewhat more
untrained and a more reflective.
(’l‘runslttted this means those ol‘ the
rock persuasion should have
patience).

\\'hi|c Akkcrman is an interpreter.
he ts also a writer. llis orchestral
piece ".Ia\ch" develops out ol'an ap—
preciation lor the composers includ—
:d on the alhtua. totally devoid of
rock. “.Iaveh" is a haunting and
heatttilttl song that also ventures

near impressionistic grounds. The I

contrast between the anguished and
disjointed beginning that soon melts
into a serene picttlrc tor the car
etnphusi/es the song's predominate
tranquility.

ltut «\kkerman rocks—on ttud ex-
perimettts as he proves with “House
ol the King" and "tummy." both ol‘
which tcatttre es-Vanilla l-‘udgers
l im llogarl and Carmine Appice in
their new illlpl't)\ ed lortn. “ House of
the King" is a locus jaunt which
t\kkerntan now pcrsonalizes itt his
bun-twang electric guitar lead. Ac-
tually it sottuds like electric rubber
bands played rather convincingly.

the opening segment. "I Am.“'
leatut'cs Akkerman on organ in the .
tradition of the best opera house’-
phantoms. A cultist chorus sings
Iree-lorm ltartnonies. For the'nexl
segment. "Asleep. Halt‘ Asleep.
Awake." he uses slightly distorted
guitars to achieve the effect ol‘
haywire clocks. An Indian inﬂuence
is present in “She Is." on which
Akkcrman imitates sitar tone and
tamhoura drone. Drummer Appice
catches like a magnet to the quick
bursts ol Akkerman and spins off
into his own solo on "tummy." the
only segment which is dissappoin-
ting because ot the dircctionless
playing that occurs when he is rejoin-
