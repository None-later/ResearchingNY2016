In many bridge problems. South is
playing the hand in a game contract
or slam. He (invariably a 'he‘lusual-
ly must find a clever way of
maneuvering one or two more tricks.
Well. today we‘re giving the
defenders a chance to shine. Again.
South is playing the hand. in four
hearts. but this time it will be shown
that the greedy South declarcrs (who
usually have the best hands) don‘t
always have to make the contract.

West. who has overcallcd South‘s
opening bid with | Spade. leads the
deuce of clubs. which is won in dum-
my. fire Queen of diamonds is led.
As East. do you cover the Queen of
diamonds when it‘s led at trick two’.’

Obviously. the answer is “yes”;
otherwise the seemingly rhetorical
question would not have been asked.

l‘irst let‘s see what happens if East
doesn't make this inspired play.

In chess. there are many offshoot
openings which are used in an effort
to deviate from lines which are too
well known by one‘s opponent.
These openings are usually risky but
have the attractive feature of being
exciting and mysterious. Often the
sacrifice of a pawn is involved. A
general rule involving garnbils is that
the best way to refute a gambit is to
accept it. ()l course there are excep—
tions to this rule (such as the Queen‘s
(ianrbit opening).

(Inc such opening is the Center

Bridg

by Henry Jacobson

West wins and returns. say. another
club. Dummy wins and the Jack of
diamonds is led. Whether East plays
his'King now or later. South cannot
be prevented from discarding two
losing spades. thus ensuring the con-
tract.

Now assume East has the foresight
to play his King ol‘diamonds at trick
two. He then leads a spade. partner
plays the Queen and follows with the .
Ace of spades. A further spade lend.
rul'led by East. sets the contract one
trick: one diamond. two spades. one
spade ruff.

If South has anything but a
singleton diamond. it matters not
whether East plays his King as soon
as possible. l'hc crucittl case is where
South has a lone diamond. and
spades must he attacked immediate-
ly lrorn Iiast's hand.

Chess

(Inc of the most popular lines for
black is 2, ...N-|\'li3 which attacks
the OP a second time. While can
now try to hold on to the extra pawn
wall 3. l'—Qli4 l’—Ql33; 4. l’xl’ le’
but whitc's backward Ql’ usually
provides compensation for the
pawn. Another plan lor white is to
transpose into the l’anowllotvinnik
attack ol the Caro-Karin defense
With 3. l’-Qli4 l’-Qli3;4. |’-Q4. This
usually leads to a highly positional
game with white having. the in-
rtrativc. Alternatively white can ig-
nore his hanging QI’ and play 3. I’-
Q4 which allows black to equalize
the material but which gives while a
laslrng initiative in the game.

Alth' 2. l’xl’ Qxl’ white can gain
time by 3, N-QISJ which develops a
prccc and attacks blaek‘s queen
simultaneously. Ilowever. after 3.
...Q-QR4 or Q-Ql the game usually
goes into an unclear game with white
havmg only a slight initiative.

However. one ol the best replies to
2. ...N-Kli3 is now 3. B-NSch and
alter black plays Ii-QZ: white plays 4.
0—04. l‘hisnllows wltitcto hold on to
his material advantage and also to
maintain the initiative. the usqu
line is 4. Ii-li4 l'-QN4; 5. B-NJ Ii-NS;
o. l'-Kli3! lI-III; and it is clear that
white wrll maintain the advantage.
lherc rs sortie counterplay in this line
Ior black. but it is almost nonexis-
tent.
