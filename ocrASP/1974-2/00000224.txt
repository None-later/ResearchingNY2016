3; come out of this thing afterull. Let us.
i hope the voters draw the logical con-

'clusion that the less power the
' politicians have over our lives the

better off we are.

Unfortunately. it is to be feared
that instead there will be a mass ex-
odus of the voters to the Democratic
Party. especiallly if the Republicans
put up a real: “nebbish” as their
Presidential candidate in '76. The
scenario could then proceed with the
left wing of the Democrats. as
represented by McGovern and
Kennedy. battling it (lit with the
Wallace forces in the Democratic
convention. The compromise can-
didate settled upon could then be
superstatist Henry Jackson. sup-

A . porter ofboth a big military complex
“ and also a big welfare-socialist type
I government. all of which is a hell of a
scary combination if individual
liberty means anything at allto you.

The newly-elected Democratic.
Administration in Washington
would then be faced with enormous
inﬂation as the government builds
up a huge budget deficit paying for
its expensive welfare boondogles.
The Federal Reserve would issue in-
creasing amounts of paper money.
and the decreasing value of the
dollar would cause the Democrats to
begin wage and price controls. thus
causing worse inﬂation as acute
shortages develop. unemployment
rises. welfare! doles increase. and
more paper money is brought faith
to pay for welfare. The powers-that-
be naturally would decide that the
solution is to put controls on
everything from bubblegum
manufacture to the sale of steel
girders and eighteen-hour girdles.
The resulting shortages. occurring.

when are makers of bubblegum.

girders and girdles decide they might

. as w‘ell‘quit and go on welfare—since

they‘re not making anymoney the
old way—result in widespread strik-
ing. demonstrating and an oc-
casional riot here and there.

At this! point the statist politician
.. can do one or two things or. worse.

,ye’t'. both. He can nationalize the in-
dustries. saying capitalism obviously
did not ‘work. or he can start a war.
since peace seemed to be bad for the
economy anyway. He can take both
steps if he really wants toappearasa
man of action and determination in
the face of imminent danger from
within and abroad.

Of course. if you want a war. it has.
to be far from home so the voters
won‘t mind it too much.and it has to
have enthusiastic support so the
voters will overlook the shortages
and other problems at home.

This means an incident. If you
want a good exciting war you've got,
to Travel an incident to whip up public
support for the upcoming battles. In
the past this has been done very craf-'
tily and successfully. Sending a
passenger ship full of smuggled
weapons into submarine infes'ted‘
waters worked really well once. since
the weapons were going to the guys
who. were lighting the submarines.
and the subs were sure to try to
torpedo the ship. which they did.

Since that trick and variotisi
variations of it have been used-
already. we might try something
new. Send Ralph Nader to Arabia.’
for instance. where he could try to
force the King to install seat-belt in-
tcrlbck systems on thedesert camels.
'l'he nomads might get mad enough
to kidnap oursafety apostle. and our
President could use that as the ex-
cuse to start a war.

All in all. the possibilities are
endless. The outlook is grim. Both
partiesappearmorallybankruptand
unconcerned with personal liberty.
especially economic liberty. Will the
voters see the alternatives? Roger
MacBride did in ‘72 when he cast his
Electoral Vote for something better.
Mike Oliver does in ‘74; he hopes to
start a new. free island nation
somewhere near the US within the
next few months. Anyone coming? .

Our student leaders have
developed a remarkable knack for
saying and doing the wrong thing at
the ’lwrong time. Just as the'Statev
legislature threatens the existence of
mandatory tax. various candidates
for SA. President and Vice Presi-
dent propose mcasurcs that would
render the tax system pointless and
destructive. Justus Central Council
calls for administrative respon-
siveness to a "University Communi-
ty". it defaults on its own respon-
‘sibility to that community.

The candidates have righteoust
decided that what SUNYA really
needs is free movies and parties.
Simple! Cut out a few non-
essentials. such as culture and
academics. or better still. cut
everybody‘s budget by twenty per
cent. Obviously. the mere factor of
attendenpe. with but a few thousand
students paying the outrageous fee
of fifty cents to a dollar each
weekend. proves that the twelve or
so movie houses on campus will in-
evitably fold without further sub-
sidization. (And if any goddam
elitist snobs think they're too good
for beer and circuses. that they want
v to go camping. or listen toa speaker,
or hear, some classical music. let

sake.

The purpose of any tax system is
to redistribute the community‘s
funds towards the community‘s
needs. Would the people of New
York State voluntarily cast their
"dollar votes" for minority appeal
programs such as low cost housing
or prison reform. there would be no
need for taxes. But God knows. none
of us are so far-sighted or selﬂess.
and thus we accept. the annoyance of
taxes. Bat if-the governmentwere to
take the money from the citizens
only to spend it. dollar for dollar as
they would. both government and
tax system would become a pointless
bureaucratic testimony to the spirit
of Catch-22.

S.A. is on the verge of fitting this
description.

Our Student Association's recent
actions threaten to destroy many of
the small groups it has previously
supported. thereby makingthe Land
of White Concrete more bland than
ever. Music Council seems to have
been the first to go. With impeccable
logic. our Leaders have once again

 

them go to a U.r:i'i‘yver§it_v“fog Christ's N

am

organizations which are ﬁf-
sustaining should be subsidiz ‘ y
S.A. If Music Council really deserv-
ed money. after all. it should be able.
to prove it- by not' needing it. Top
l‘orty radio and Congress have held
such logic sacred for‘years. But'l'op-
Forty programming can be very
destructive; thanks to Central Coun-
cil‘s wisdom. there will be no
classical concert series on campus
next year.

“But ab!"'say our wise represen-

' tativcs. “Untruc! The music depart-

ment students faculty can play all
they want. Who needs Horowitz.
alter all. when you‘ve got Findley
Cockrcll‘!“ Mr. Cockrell isa very line
pianist. I agree. but look at all the
fine rock groups on campus: Who
needs the Allman Brothers when
you‘ve got Sweatband‘!

IS.A. blames Music Council for
causing its own demise. and
granted. the group‘s leadership this

year was no bargain. But. “Reform!” ‘

say our student leaders.“and you
shall be restored“. But why get a new
jockey‘ for a dead horse'.’ Several
highly qualified people who were in-
terested in running Music Council
next year have now given up: what‘s
left to administer? It‘s like calling for
reform in the Spanish Republic.

Lastly. our leaders say. “Music
Council is not our responsibility“."lf
S.A. were to negotiate the issue with
the Administration. this argument‘
might hear some weight. but. in
reality. S.A. has merely renounced
its responsibility without worrying
about a replacement. leaving Music
Council like a baby on the doorstep
of an empty house.

()ur own words abouta University
Community mean little unless we
contribute to it. In a small city such
as Albany. the University is
necessarily a focal point of culture.
By destroying Music Council. S.A.
expresses contempt for its own con-
cept of the University. as it screws
both the larger community and the
student body.

And. music is not the only interest
' threatened by this destructive new

philosophy of student government.
if the combination of Catch-22 logic
and Top Forty programming are ex-
tended to their logical conclusion.
every minority appeal organization
will be similarlyjeopardized.and the
diversity which is essential to a real
university may well be stifled. But.
boy oh boy. will we have movies...

Over'the course of most of this
semester a “00.0009 budget. cover-
.ing all'areas of Student Association
'funding. was churned out. ﬁrst by
Budgét Committee and then by Cen-

. 'tral Council. With the budget con-

taining few of the outrageous in-
novations that Budget Committees:
have made in the past. thedocument
was dealt with in a relatively
streamlined process over the span of
six Council sessions.

There were only two‘ “issues”
which generated any semblance of
the spectacular confrontations one
expects from a budget hearing.
Significantly. both of these points
were ones that had not been resolved
in Budget Committee. which an-
derscores how effective the Com-
mittee was when it did make a
recommendation.

Five Quad Ambulance Service
presented the first major problem.
when they asked fora [well-justified]
budget of approximately $|2.500.
$9.000 of which was to pay fora new
ambulance. All other methods of
funding were either already being
taken into account. not available. or
too uncertain to be relied upon for
such a vital service. While most of
Council agreed upon the necessity to
fund l‘iivc Quad. it was realized that
such an expenditure might force a
raise in the munditory student tax
from its present level of $32 per
semester. With several bills now
before the State Legislature which
would do away with mandatory tax-
us. such a move on SUNYA (the
campus most visible and immediate
to many legislators) might have been
politically disastrous. Fortunately a
compromise was born which
sparkled in its simplicity and effec—
tiveness. and which brought an end
to four hours of meandering debate.
The cost of the new ambulance
would be paid through an internal
Student Association loan (taken
from the $l00.000+ Athletic Ad-
visory Board surplus) to be paid
back during the next four years.
With this ﬁnancial burden lifted. the
tax level could easily remain the
same.

The other major issue dealt with
an aspect of funding philosophymot
funding difficulty. Fucrza Latina. a
group representing the interests of
Latin—American students on cam-
pus. approached Council} stating
that the E0l’-SA was not responsive
to their programming needs. a func-
tion which should have been carried
out by BOP-SA. Utilyzing the logic

LOP-SA (that minority group stu-
dents‘bc allowed to program their
own events). and also using many
hours of debate. Council decided to
fund Fuerza Latina. granting it the
right to determine Latin—American
student programing.

One should not get the impression
,that it is only the complex issues.
