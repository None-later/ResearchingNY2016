wasn‘t'lsurprised at all, and the
Albany weather, according to head
coach Keith .Munsey. was “just
typical.“ All ‘Were prime factors
Wednesday as Albany State became
the number one college track team in
the Capital District. by edging Un-
ion College 73-72. .

the meet was built up all week in
the local papers as a “d ream match"
between two neighboring
powerhouses who somehow had
never faced each other before in var-
sity spring track. For a change. l
was not the only reporter of some
stature attending a track battle on
our campus. There were ace
sportswritcrs from The Km‘ck News
'1‘iiiies-Unt'0ni. and Selionet-Iudy
Gazette present. .

the weather. however. did not
prove very friendly for our guests.
The warm. dry hint ol‘summer which
had supplanted students from their
dorms to the campus lawns just this
past Sunday. had been driven out by
a brisk north wind. With it had come
cloudiness and temperatures in the
low 40‘s. making the day uncomfor-
table l‘or spectators, and nearly un-
bearable for the competitors clad in

" erb Hagan was ehtedlhteli"

shorts arid t-shirt's.

Yet everyonewas’iiot combiéiely _

unhappy by the conditions. Alterth

meet. Munsey said. “I've been telling ‘
‘ our guys all year that they just have

to live with these conditions. and use
them for their own advantage. Un-
ion doesn't know what it‘s like to
perform in this weather. When it‘s
cold there. they just go into their
beautiful warm lieldhousc. We learn
to be Iottﬁlier than they are.“ added
the coach. who still worethe rubbers
over his shoes which he used to keep
his l'eet warm during the meet.
39m of the people Munsey reached
on the toughness idea was Mel
Moore. Running into the wind on
his approach. Moore. said Munscy.
“pulled the upset ofthcday for us“ in
the triple jump. His leap of 42 feet. 8
Mi inches proved victorious byjust an
inch and a quarter over Union‘s sc-
cond place finisher. Equally impor-
tant was Gary Washington‘s third in
the event. as the points brought
Albany from six points back to three
behind. with Mo events to go.
Moore knew before he jumped of
the importance of a victory for the
team. but he also wanted the victory

been telling me that We been coming
along well all year." said Moore. but

Moore's problem so far has been
that many of hisbettet‘ leaps have

qualifying them. “I even fouled to-
day on my last jump of the trialsand

possibly the wind helped hold him
behind the line on that one.

Nothing held Rudy Vido back in
the shot put. however. as he won
with a itoss of 52' Ill/t“. The effort
qualified him for the National
Championships in Illinois next
month. The throw was also almost
four feet beyond his previous high
this year. and bested Union‘s top
putter. who had been out—distancing
Vido‘s throws all spring.

The improved performance did
not surprise Vido. however. Said
Munsey. “Before the meet. Rudy
told me that he would definitely beat
this guy today and not to worry
about it.“ Vido had a simple cx-
planation for his fine hcavu: "The
competition. man.“ The competition
finished at 50 feet. 8 inches. and

The happiest winner.3howeiIer.
was miler Herb Hanan. Hasan had
been having some tough luck this

spring. He missed the ﬁrst mccl of

the year due to a bad virus. and then
was tripped accidentally in the third
meet of the season versus Williams

' while running the mile. He was even

upset over the fact that this reporter
had failed to mention his fine 4:24
third place mile finish last week at
Oswego. “I guess third place isn‘t
good enough for the paper. huh?“
were his exact words.

Wednesday he made that over-
sight unnecessary. l’laced in the mile
in order to beat Union‘s Steve Jones
for second place. Hasan came
around the linitl turn right behind
favorite Rich Langl'ord of Albany.
and yards ahead of Jones. Then, in
Munscy‘s words. “Hasan decided
that .lones wasn‘t enough."

Langford was back. however. in] ,
the next-to-last event—the, 
mile run. He was there because“ r

Albany needed a sweep of the first

three places (nine points) to assure

victory. since Union was favored to
win the tinal event—the mile relay—
and pick up live more points.
Already leading by three. that would
give Union an 8-point edge. ex-
cluding the 3-milc.

From the start. the race was all

' Albany as Carlo Cherubino opened

with a (is-second first-quarter lap".
and just moved away from there. His
winning time was l4:39.4. with
Albany‘s Nick DcMarco second.
and the redeemed Langford third.

Union did win the mile relay to
close to within a point. but that was
as far as they got. Albany‘s win
streak was now 25 and Union‘s had
ended. at l5.
