Tuition Bill
Funding Denied

by Edward Maser and Daniel
Gaines '

PlRG at SUNYA received I
serious blow Friday when it was
learned that SUNY Central (The
SUNY system administration) re-
jected their bid for a spot on the bill.
The group had proposed that they be
funded with a voluntary fee that
would'appear as an optional line on
the bill.

The decision followed months of
unexplained delay. which involved
many unanswered phone calls and
other classical forms of impersonal
bureaucracy.

The rationale for the decision was
described by Chancellor Ernest

Boyer in a meeting yesterday with .

l’lRG at SUNYA Chairperson
Joanne Slaight and Projects
Chairperson Chriss Aidun. As Ms.
Slaight and Mr. Aidan understand
it. the proposal was rejected because
PIRG is defined as a private
organization which is outside the
University and “in” with private
schools. It was explained by Boyer
and SUNY Central Vice President
Cliff 'l'horn. who was also at the
meeting. that it wasn‘t possible to use
SUNY macltinery. which is State
machinery. to collect even an op-
tional l'ce fora private organitation.
This was also explained by SUNY
Central PR ntan Russ (.iugino on
Friday; he said that it was important
to see that the decision does not cort-
cern the existanee or the desirability
of PIRG funding. but whether the
specific proposal PIRG introduced
was ulegitimatc method of collecting
funds.

Eleven weeks ago. members of
HRS at SUNYA wrote to Harry
Spindler. Vice-Chancellor ofSUNY
for Finance and Business. and asked
for a decision on the validity of the
two-dollar plan. At the time Mr.
Spindler promised a reply within a
month.

When fottr weeks ltad elapsed
witltout an answer. members of
PI ltti at SUNYA continually called
Mr. Spindlcr‘s office over a dotcn
times during a two week period.
None of the calls were returned.

Spring had hit Washington. The
city needed a general cleaning: main-
taincnce men swapt up last year's
bark and leaves; caretakers spread
chemicals on the laWn to kill the
crabgrass that had sprouted despite
careful seeding; workers repainted
chipped patches on the Wltitc
House. And about 8.000 people
came to the city with the hopes that
their pleasant afternoon marelt
might urge Congress to clean out the
Oval Office.

For some demonstrators the‘

marelt down Pennsylvania Avenue
to the Capitol from the Lincoln
Memorial was their ﬁrst. Dis-
illusioncd with sending letters to
their Congressmen. they wanted to
get out and physically demenstrate
their desire to see Nixon removed
from office.

For many others. like the Yippies
and the Y AF. this rally was far from
their tirst. They came to Washington
as they have one every year since
the Moratorium of I969 to protest
the whole operation of the system.
“Another year. another demonstra—
tion." one student pronounced.

The National Campaign to lnt-
peach the President. with its head—
quarters a ten-minute walk from the
White House. organitcd the
demonstration. The Yippies. the At-
tica Brothers Defense League. attd
the Progressive Labor Party all urg-
ed their members to come.

The Campaign also attracted
some speakers for the rally after the
march: Congressman Parren
Mitchell. United Farm Workers
Vice/President Dolores Huerta
Chicago-Eight conspirator Davie
Dillinger. the Rev. Kilpatriek. and
folk-singer Phil Ochs.

The March was to start at lla.m..
but as Campaign worker 'l‘om
l‘lalfertv said. “Some kids got lterc a
week ago a lot got here three days
ago. ntore titan that got here two
days ago. and yesterday. well. yester-
day we were swamped.“

Headquarters for the Campaign is
on the second floor of a once grand.
but now decayed. red-brick building
of the same vintage us many Albany
town houses near Washington Park.
Protesters and demonstrators
drifted up there to get specific in'-
struetions for the march itself.

They were told to meet down by
the Ellipse. a lawn in the back of the
White House. Others gathered
around the reflecting pool in front of
the Lincoln Memorial.

The Yippies arrived first. having
speakers set up and a bank playing as
early as ten in the morning. They
smoked dope. dropped acid. and
begged for cocaine. by way of getting
in the mood for the march.

llugh“Wavy Gravy“ Romney was
there. attd so was A..l. Webermun.
'l'hc Yippies claimed that FBI agents
disguised as tourists were snapping
pictures of everyone there. At one

point. a federally registered car
pulled up with four men in
government-grey color suits. Weber-
man said over the crackling speaker
system. “There‘s a car out there in
the back. Looks like four pigs are
watching. We don‘t want themfln
come down for nothing. do we?“
Leaders of the group started moving
for the car. with faithful Yippies
following. Most got no more than
l00 yards toward the car when it
sped away. leaving hot rubber on the
asphalt.

At twelve. by the reflecting pool.
National Campaign leaders decided
to start the march. A parade permit
had been issued by the city. and.
about forty police. well-trained in
crowd cotttrol. moved their motor-
cycles out in military formation.

Marching down Pennsylvania
Avenue with the Capitol building the
only white against the sky.
demonstrators chanted “Dick must
go! March to Impeach! Jail to the
Chief! Shoot Ford First! and Patty
Hearst. Live Like Her!" A few
tourists watched. a feW truck drivers
gave demonstrators the finger. and a
few Volkswagens beeped their horns
appreciativcly.

Arriving at the platform site a
block away from the Capitol
building. the crowd sat down. sunn-
cd themselves. pulled out the grass.
and listened to speakers and enter-
tainers.

David Dillinger‘s theme was.
“Impeachment itself might be a
cover—up.“ He thinks Congress
might feel they ltave solved all the
problems if tltcy remove Nixon from
Office. whereas he says they‘ll have
only begun to solve the nation‘s
problems.

Woodie Guthrie era. sung tltrce
songs. He was interrupted by
streakcrs carrying the black. red. and
green Yippie flags fora split second
it looked like there might be a fight
between the Yippies and the crowd.
which wasn‘t in the mood for the
Yippie games. but Ochs said in a
quiet voice. “Hey people. just keep
still. Let ‘em pass quietly by. We'll.
get down to the business of impeach-
ment after they‘re gone."

‘1 After the demonstration. one stu-
dent suid. “The thing a lot of them
don‘t realirc is that Americans have
become inundated with strikes. The
march is just a starting point for

‘ something bigger.“

y him. Pat Curran
walked away with the
elcttton. capturing 53.8% of the total
votes in a six - way race.

Gayle Knibloe ran a distant se-
ettnd place with [8.6%. a figure far
below projected estimates made
before and during the election.

The necessary majority was not
expected. and Curran at best was ex-
pected to be involved in a run-off
with either Knibloe or llaiper. who
came in with only l4.6 percent ofthe
1358 votes cast in the Presidential
race.

Hnlper was expected to capture
the disscnehantcd fringe of students.
due primarilon the l'tlctthathc bas-
ed his cntirc campaign on the accusa-
tion that the Student Association
was an elitist clique.obviously inten-
ding to present himself as the pop-
ulist candidate.

His only competition to that fac-
tion was supposed to come from
Sammy 'l'homas. also alleging the
cliquish nature of S.A. The fact that
llttlper and Thomas combined.
totaled less titan in percent of the
vote indicates that citltcr the
students couldn‘t care if S.A. is clos-
ed Io their involvement. or they
simply didn't believe them.

Curran‘s surprising majority is a
significant blow to the present S.A.
in any event. Curran represents a
composite of the old Student
Association of the Mike Lampert
era. and the future. demonstrated by
tile active participation and direc-
tion to his campaign given him by
David Coync. probably next year‘s
Central Cottncil Chairperson. and
Lew Fidler. the classic student in-
stitutional political activist. focusing
his energies in Council and Senate
rather than on the_soapbox.

'l‘hc insult to S.A. is especially
hard since the top officers in the Ger-
her Administration. most notably
(ierher. Davis and Kanarek went far
out of their way to endorse Knibloe's
candidacy. 'l‘hough Knibloc tried to
disassociate herself from organized
S./\. assistance. she apparently was
not sufficiently successful.

In the Vice-Presidential race. the
unusually large plurality in Ken
Wax‘s 44 percent semi-victory is due
largely to two factors: his late con-
ccntrated campaign and Birnbaum‘s
apparent bulk of support coating
from the Alumni campus. where he
once was Quad board President.
