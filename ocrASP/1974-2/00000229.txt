by Maureen D. Giles-

One quiet nocturnal evening in
April. a small group of Puerto Rican
students. on invitation, descended
upon suite 504 at the State Universi-
ty at Albany. Topic of discussion:
discriminatitin

“We‘re called Spies, Ricans,
Slime, and Greasers," they said, “by
people on this campus.” Some had
flesh which was very dark; while
others has lily white complexions.
Some accents were easy, but others
were undetectable.

One Iightbulb shone bright in the
crowded suite living room as .iose
Rivera spoke about problems in thc
classroomf‘The typical Puerto Rican
who comes from a broken home had

Hut almost too late, programs like

those feelings of insecurity and

this is due to the desire of those in
