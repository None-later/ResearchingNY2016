Boyer’s SUNY Tenure Decision:

by Glenn von Noatitz
ALBANY- The State University
of New York is facing

News a serious “tenure
Analysis crunch" and
Chancellor Ernest

Boyer proposes to do
something about it in a plan soon to
be released. , V

Then “tenure crunch". as it I is :
termed. came about as enrollment in”
colleges and universities leied hff and _-.
as more and more juniory faculty
members reached their mandatory
ywr and applied for tenure. Unfor-
tunateiy SUNY stopped growing
and few faculty are retiring. so the
number of open tenured slots has
remained small.

The result has been a rash of high-
ly controversial tenure fights across
the SUNY system. Normally
qualiﬁed and popular professors are
"being forced to pack\ their bags. and
atonme institutions. most notably
SUN! Albany. their plight has
becomelthe most heated issue on
campus. Audents have organized in
support of popular professors who

have been axd, and confrontation

with the administration over the
tenure cases has become common.
The Chancelor‘scnure statement
represents an attemprto alleviate the
problem. It was dravnn up in

January and is now being evaluated

by other administrators. the .Faculty

   
 

 

Senate. and the Student Assembly.

The statement proposes 'several
mos that could relieve the cruncli;in
eluding:

.'I'lli

"Ereduction of the mandatory
retirement age from 70 to 65.

-extension of the timeperiod'after
which tenurel is mandatory from
three to four years at the senior
ranks. . "'

-maintenance 'o'f the present seven-
year rule. but making the “prior ser-
vice credit policy" more ﬂexible. It
would still be possible to count up to '
three years prior service credit, but
campus presidents] would be
authorized to negotiate this with
each newly appointed member to the
faculty.

-stressing more vigorously the
precess of tenure review. making
sure tenure is extended only to those
who are emminently qualified. In
other words. tightening up the gran-

ting of tenure. ,

development of a program for
retraining faculty to equip them to
serve in other. though not un-
necessarily unrelated. ﬁelds.

Boyer also calledffor a reaffirma-
tion of tenure ill the statement. “The
principle of tenure is sound and the
policy should be preserved.“

Quota System?

The chief objective of the
Chancellor's statement seems to be
avoidance of a tenure quota like that
imposed at the City University over
the vehement objections of the facul-
ty. ’ Under a quota system no more
than a fixed percentage of the faculty
in a department are allowed to get a
tenure. No candidate.no matter how
qualified. can receive} tenure if it
would mean exceeding the quota.

Some college administrators say a

70-80 tenured department is inflexi-
ble because attractive new prospects
cannot be hired. and thelsize of the
faculty cannot be reduced even if
enrollment declines. Faculty fcharge
that under a quota system morale is
destroyed because even the most ex-
ceptional junior professor cannot
receive tenure.

The big question now is whether
Bover’s modest proposals can
forestall establishment: of such a
quota system on SUNY campuses.
The Chancellor calls for a “healthy
ratio“ between tenured and non-
tenured faculty in his statement. at
are the measures outlined in the
statemqldusdequate for that goal?

Vice-Chancellori‘for University Af-
fairs Clifton Thorne a swers these
questions affirmatively. Thorne
thinks that enough new tenure

The first migrant farmworker

company in I967. The United
Farmworkers won this election and
negotiated a contract with Gallo.
Wages were increased. child labor
wasended. use of pesticides en-
datigering) farm workers was
restricted. and. the union hiring hall
system was instituted. as a result of
the contract.

Profits for Gallo also rose during
this period. Profits in I972 were 44
million dollars. Gallo spent I3

decade to ensure adequate space for
professors not presently tenured. He
suggests that some of
this expansion will come fromexten-
sion of education'into a lifetime ac-
tivitywith an increase in the number
of students older than 30.
Moreover, he says that in some
geographical areas expansion is con-
tinuing. The State is still developing
the college at Old Westbury on Long
Island. and will be needing a large
number of professors to staff it.
There arr. also some disciplines
where tenured positions will be
opening up. Thorne asserts.
Thorne does say that there will in-
evitably be an increase in the number
of controversial tenure cases and

that it will become more difficult .
than ever to attain tenure. “Writing

a statement doesn‘t change the
problems." Thorne cautions. “But
hopefully this statement will take
care of a large portion of the
problem."

It is still too early to predictlac-
curately what will happen to
enrollments and the size of the Un-
iversity.‘ Thorne says. But no matter
what happens. the University will
never abandon tenure: “There must
be job security. The steeiworkers
and teachers have it. Why not Un-
iversity professors?“

Last summer Gallo refused to
renew their contracts with the U FW.
They claimed that farmworkcrs
wanted theTeamatergUriionto repre-
sent them but no election wa held.
Gallo then signed a contract WI h the
Teamsters. Theworkers went-out on
strike in protest of the signing of the
contract. Gallo then brought in
strikebreakers and used violence to
try to break the strike.

In late September as the harvest
ended the workers voted to leave for
the cities to begin a boycott of all
Gallo wines. April .24 Was Boycott

The Albany friends of the
Farmworkers group has joined in
calling for the wine boycott.

A Delicate Balance

main unchanged. Thorne says. The
University may become more cogni-
zant of problems on the individual
campuses. but will not interfere with
specific cases.

A Delicate Balance

The Chancellor‘s tenure proposals
stack up like a balancing act. On one
side lies the distasteful tenure quota
system with its injustices to junior
faculty. 0n the other side are an in-
creasing number of hot tenure fights.

Accompanied by antagonized
students. bitter feelings. and an-
employment lines for axed
professors.

Tllorne may be right. it may be
possible to do the balancing act and
succeed; to avoid the tenure quota
and the tenure fights. But there are
thousands of young professors and
very few older. retiring ones. What
will happento all of the young ones
whf enrollment starts declining in
I980?

Tenure will not be abolished. no
matter how much students complain
about mediocre professors who are
protected by the tenure shield.
Professors must have job security
just like anyone else. and more than
that. they must have aczldemlc
freedom.

One temporary solution receiving
national -attention last year was
developed at Union College. ll small
anduuntil recently. all male college ill
Schenectady. New York. Union lliltl

’ several wellqualificd professors with

ivy League degrees and excellent
teaching ratings applying for tenure
last year. The college gave them ﬁve
year renewable contract; because
there were no open tenure slots blll
Union didn‘t want to lose them
altogether. Union‘s action gave the
instructorsjob security for five more
years. although they did admit to
having little academic freedom with
renewal of their Contract hanging

I over their heads.

Vice-Chancellor Thorne said

" SUNY closely examined the Union

College plan. but never seriously
considered adopting it. The Union
plan arous‘ed the ire of the American
Association ofUniversity Professors
(AAUP). who charged that it was a
first step toward complete abolition
oftcnure. Apparently. SU NY wants
to avoid inflaming the faculty.

But in a few years the tenure
crunch may increase in severity. and
We might see the Union plan. oravarin

iVeraity of New York. If the pflpttSillS

The New York Public Interest
Research Group. a non proﬁt. non-
partisan research and advocacy
organisation, has. openings for 75
student intents over the summer.
These posts are in Syracuse. Albany.
New York City, Buffalo. and Utica.
and are available on both a paid or

volunteer basis. with stipends of up
to 5750 available for a six-week  Culll‘ll

minimum stint.

NYPIRG. whose stated goals are
to instruct students in citizenship
skills and to channel student
research into responsible advocacy.
will assist volunteers in gaining
academic credit for their work. The
positions are open to any student.
high school seniors through
graduate. and faculty.

internships will be the f flowing:
Mortgage Lending Practices Study
(Syracuse); Mass Transit Plan

tionControl (Alb.); Guide to Public
Roads (Alb.. NYC). Establishing a.
Small Claims Court (Queens); and
compiling Consumer Guides (NYC).

NYPIRG gives the follow caution:

The internship experience will not be
a relaxing. easy way to while away
the summer. our standards are high
and all interns will be expected to
meet them. Projects will be super-
vised by professional staff members
who work long hours. Interns will be
expected to do the same.

’l‘he'Bureau of Cultural Affairs. an
agency within the city of Albany. is
involved in historical research and
archeological excavation. Projects
undertaken by this office are usually
confined to the City of Albany. but
may. at times. extend beyond thecity
limits to outlying areas of interest
and significance.

At this time the Bureau is in- .
tcrcsted in acquiring student interns
and/ or student wishing to complete
term papers or projects through field
work. Allocation of tasks will be
determined according to the in-
terests of the individual student and
will be based upon availability of
work. largely inﬂuenced by projects
already in progress.

The following areas of study will
be made available through this of-
lice:

HISTORICAL RESEARCH

‘I‘his work involves careful and
complete documentation which is
usually assembled through the use of
municipal and county records (c.g.
tax records. city directories. maps.
deeds and numerous secondary
sources). Research is often done in
conjunction with thcdiscovery ofnr-
tifacts or salvage materials ex-

cttvulcd at :lrcllcological sites within
the city.
Projects in related areas that are
designed by individual students may
also be taken into consideration.

petition sponsored by the newly
created Preservation League of New

New York State Council on the Arts.

Called “Unique New York.“ the
program invites individuals
throughout the State to submit
proposals on fostering community
amenities. interpreting anti
promoting the values of neighb-
orhoods and town centers. lluiting
environmental decay and otherwise
cnhnncillg aspects of the environ-
meat.

"Environmental Arts is a relative-
ly new area. ll vast open-ended field."
explained Kathleen Reardon, acting
coordinator of the “Unique New
York" competition. “it touches on
such areas as architectural.
economic and social history. public
on. planning. toning ordinances and
real estate decisions. if individuals
develop a sense of futility in dealing
with aspects oftheir environments. it
is largely because their ideas have no
outlets and no authority. We believe
there is a vast reservoir of en-
vironmentally productive ideas
residing in the citizens of New York
State. We want to encourage the

realisation of those ideas."

To be considcrctl. each applica-
tion must include file following:
I) lift: applicant's name. address.
social security number. telephone
number (with area code) typed on
the first page.
2) A brief (one or two page.
typewritten. double spaced) descrip-
tion of the idea or project. including
the significance of the project to the
community.
3) A statement of how the individual
will implement the proposal.
4) An explanation of public use or
recognition of the project.
5) A detailed budget for implemen-
