What The Defense
Pentagon

Compiled from Zotloe News Service

(ZNS) The Defense Department-
believe it or notis currently perfec-
ting a computer tint will be capable
of understanding your thoughts by
reading your brainwaves. '

Research on this Wild-like device

is being conducted at the Stanford ~

Research Institute in California un-
der a grant from the Pentagon‘s ‘Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency"
or [he A.R.P.A." I 7

Stephen Lukasik, the director of
the A.R.P.A.. states that the mind-
reading computer is programmed to
receive and understand the human
brain‘s electronic signals. The
A. R. P.A. says that it likes to refer to
the project. not as “a mind-reading
computer," but rather as “pattern
recognition techniques.“

The Pentagon's A.R.P.A. section
reports that the computer system is
designed to measure the electro-
encephalogram (E.E.Cr.) signals
emitted as a person thinks, compare
these signals to pre-recorded
patterns stored in the computer‘s
memory bank, and then to diagnose
what the person is thinking.

According to Stanford Research
Institute. the computers have
recorded up to 60 percent accuracy
in picking out the correct E.E.G.
patterns—and the research is'orilv'tn
infancy. '

The thought-reading project is
similar to another Pentagon com-

Dept Is Doing:

puter project called “speech recogni-
tion.“ in which computers are
programmed to understand spoken
words. M.l.T. computer scientist
Professor Joseph Weizenbaum has
warned that speech recognition can
be easily abused by a government.

Doctor Weiunboum predicts that
speech recognition by computers
would enable a single machine to
monitor millions of telephone con-
versations simultaneously. listening
for “forbidden words." Weizenbaum
explainsthat when a forbidden word
is recognized by the machine, the
computer can flash a warning to a
human operator who could then
monitor the “suspicious call.”

Weizenbaum has suggested that
his colleagues in the computer
science ﬁeld should refuse to engage
in such research.

The thought-reading computer. of
course. is a major step beyond a
machine that merely understands
speech.

Cambodia Backup

Forces Deployed
(ZNS) The united States
reportedly is preparing to land a
force of 5000 Marines in Cambodia
if the Phnom Penh government falls
to the insurgents.

Paciﬁc News Service states that
Marines on active duty in Okinawa
are reporting that stepped up troop
deployments are taking place at the

Drug related arrests have
prompted some to question the lac-

pose of arresting students, par-
ticularly on marijuana violations.

Koza-Shi base, in preparation for
what is called “OperationEaglePull.”
According to Marines familiar with
the operation. “Eagle Pull" is the
code-name for the landing of
Marines in Cambodia, allegedly to
protect American civilians there.

A Pentagon spokesman conﬁrms
that Marine and regimental landing
teams based on amphibious ships
have been operating “allover the
Seventh Fleet area of the Western
Paciﬁc."

The spokesman. however. when
asked about “Operation Eagle Pull.“
refused to comment on it.

Marines who are familiar with the
operation. have told Paciﬁc News
hm it involves a forced“

coast. awaiting a major military hits

ment.

According to reports. there were
1200 men stationed off the Cambo-
dian coast last month. They are now
reported to have been fortified by the
first battalion which shipped out of
Okinawaﬂappprently headed for.

Contrary to routine practice. the
Marines in this latest operation,

An ofﬁcial from the State Univer-
sity ofij York at Albany, where
one student was arrested for posses-
sionioffjust'over an ounce of merit
juana. said the arrest will “scare a lot
of kids...We aren't an ivory tower,
we don‘t live apart from the com-
munity.” the ofﬁcial said.

If convicted, under New York’s
new drug laws the Albany students
face a possible 15 year penalty.

At Northem Illinois University
two students were arrested at a con-
cert and charged with unlawful
possession of marijuana. A student
activities ofﬁcial said it had been
“standard policy at concerts“ that no
arrests were made.

lndochinalFunds
“Discovered”

(ZNS) The Pentagon reports it has
“found” an extra $266 million which
can be used to continue supplying
U.S. military aid to Indochina.

Just two week ago. Defense
Department ofﬁcials went before the
House Armed Services Committee
and reported they need $474 million
in additional funding in order to sup-
port the lndochina military com-
mitments. Without the funding, said
Pentagon ofﬁcials, American sup-
port for Southeast Asia would have
to be terminated soon.

The House was unswayed by the
warningandvoted last week to deny
the request.

On Tuesday of this week, the Pen-
tagon announced a surprise: The
Defense Department said it had
reviewed its ﬁgures and had dis-
covered that funds appropriated by
congrcss last year had been tem-
porarily lost.

The Defense Department said that
the $266 million which has been
found will finance military
operations in Indochina until the

mutants. d._'The arrest of one per-
 inay cause greater damage than
Ntlwnh. Three thousand people
maysee one bust and then the cops
have to handle'awo irate, high peo-
ple.” ‘ 

At Mdryllnd. when police of-
ficials said earlier busts would make
a “serious dent” in the volume of
drug dealing on campus. the student
government president said the law
ofﬁcers were not “reaching the big
people" and were in fact probably
“ﬁve levels away” from the top.
“They‘re not achieving anything ex-
pect getting a lot of publicity and
ruining these young people‘s lives."
the student leader said.

At this point the Maryland .it.
vestigation was reportedly slcppcd
up. leading to the latest arrest \\ lllCll
