Grover W‘ shout. to kickoff
the two weekend concerts on cam-
pus. The eventslwerepart of Cultural
Phtt‘s'e- V-“Knowledge' and Roots“
sponsored by E.O.P.S.A; ‘

After being introduced. Grover in

fturnfintroduced his band to the
audience. The quarter consisted of
«Grover on teno‘r. alto. and soprano
saxophones. James Simmonds on
electirc piano and clarinet. George
Johnson Jr. on drums and Charles
Fambough on electric bass.

Almost immediately Grover
launched himself into a warming
version of “You are the Sunshine of
My Life“. which almost instantly
started hundreds of heads to sway.
Grover‘s lyrical born here really ex-
pressed a completeness that' was
perfect.

Next Grover and band worked on
an extended Donald Byrd tune. in
which Washington‘s ﬁngers wercva
mere blur on the valves of his
beautifully engraved hornsl.
Energetieally Grover ran up and
down the scale ofhis sax as the band
very tightly-accompanied him.

Georgel' Johnson Jr‘s style of
drumming wasnothingﬁmcybut was
ratheflcrect. and well disciplined. as
Grover relaxed to let us see hisyoung
band work out.

The bass rhythms were extremely
high and at amplitude met precisely
by the rolling piano lead. As the
piano eased out. the bass stepped
into the lead. At this point the move-
ment of the bass lines were full. but
the volume of the sound was a bit
low. which didn‘t allow Clarles to

squelch marred a bit of the ban

 

 
 
    
  
  
  
  

 
 

Work. just befoe Grover rejoined the

group in working hrough the'

number. . V

Next Billy Holiday‘s “Easy Liv-
ing“ was explored. The piano started
off in a 'wind-winding fashion as
Johnson exploded on drums.
Grover. now on sxprano sax. moved
into this easier, ﬂowing tune. After
blowing an impeccably perceived
change. the bank picked up the pace.
Grover and James workedtogether

"before the horn subsided into the

backgroung and GeorgetJr. Was in-
tegrated into working with the
piano.

Appreciative. spontaneous.
applause again let the artists know
that this segment of the show was
producing the desired effect. Grover
then mellowed back into the work
and exited into a piece similar to the
intro but wilder in structure.

Right here. instinctively the band
seemed to know the time was right
for “Mr. Clean" which is probably
Grover's most noted song. After a
stunningly smooth transition the
group really started to rock out. The
piano man. using his uCry Baby".
wha-wahed onward with the bass
until they relinquished their hold so
that Geprgclcould get into his first
and only drum solo of he evening.

While before Johnson Jr. would
only seem to add the most basic of
rythmic patterns to the band‘s play.
he really laid down a “together” solo
with beautiful judgement in terms of
amount of length and approach. Not
too much by Johnson was just
pcrl'ect- for I seemed to have been

As the: group reenter-s after the

solthe‘yl'un through the chorus line '

in the final phrasing 'of the work

before running out again to ‘

applause.

Neat» a song that was “got
together“ in the found cheek.
“Where There‘s a Love“ was produc-
ed. Grover ﬂutters throughout the
wings ofa butterfly—as graceful but
faster. After another good piano
solo. Grover returned to alto sax.

Following a Stylistics tune. “Peo-
ple Make the World Go Round.“ on
which Grover played both tenor and
soprano saxes; the band gets funky.

Herc Grover packed so much
power into every breath it's incredi-
ble. The sound he produced was con-
tinuously full and powerful due to a
gifted ability of breathing extremely
smoothly. (Grover. still a young
man. should be able to retain his
wind for many years to come.
Grover's band also is extremely
young and certain technical
movements were not as clean as they
could have been. but these guys will
progress into musicians even better
than they are now.)

Grover. no showboat. let the band
play as he rocked to and fro on the
side of the stage. Again the band‘s
sound immediately gets fuller with
an increase in volume.just beforethe
band broke into “In the Ghetto.“

Next the final peice in the show.
Hancock's "Chameleon." was
provided. The popular tune was in
the same tempo as the original but it
lacked in power and appeal until the
change was made afterthc intro. The
change produced a step down from
“Chameleon‘s” structure but lost
'nothing in power. In a softer seg-
ment. it began to ﬁt into Grovef‘s
range. making it a lot better. because
Grover‘s group was not suited for the
faster style presented.

A thunderous applause rang merit

and Grover did one more. That one ‘

provoked a standing.ovation and
marked the end of an excellent ex-
ample of what black jazz is today.

Ihc Agonicx and Excess“ of a"
American Eli/c. prdwinning jour-
nalist Donald Dale Jackson has con-
structed a documentary of the

nation‘s judges. their philosophies.

their consciences. their personalities.
He offers a journalistic expedition
across the country‘s judicial
landscape. from a folksy justice of
the peace in Appalachia to the U.S.
Supreme Court. Judges from all
parts of the country. Republicans
and Democrats alike. are observed
during court proceedings and are in-
terviewed as they deliberate their
verdicts and punishments.

This is a book about people. the
people who happen to bejudges. and
only secondarily about our "system"
and the'justice it does or does not dis-
pense. The men and women vary: an
iraseible judge in a Connecticut
criminal court who “moves the
business" at the rate of hundreds of
cases a day; a bigoted Texas judge
who finds that “justice is what my
gut says it is"; another in Colorado
who can‘t make the punishment fit
the crimc:judges whosedecisions are
for sale:.and those who lie awake
nights agoniring over the sentences
they must pass.

JUDGES" demonstrates the
weaknesses and wrongdoings of a
judicial system vulnerable to
political promises and financial
gains. It also points to those people
who exemplify the most positive as
well as the negative aspects of this
system. For. as Donald Jackson
points out. each of the men and
women whose task it is to “do
justice" has individual fears and pre-
judices; special agonies and temp-
tations. and each comes to terms
with his conscience in his own way.
