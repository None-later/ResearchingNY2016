WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House Judiciary Committee Thurs-
day granted President Nixon's
lawyer broad privileges to par—
ticipate in its impeachment
proceedings. ,

The rules of procedure permitting
Nixon‘s lawyer. James D. St. Clair.
to see impeachment evidence,
suggest additional witnesses and
evidence and even question
witnesses was approved by the com-
mittee by voice vote.

The live television coverage of the
meetings was approved by the com-
mittee earlier but they .won‘t start
with initial presentation of
assembled impeachment evidence
scheduled to begin next week.

On a party-line vote. the com-
mittee rejected by a 22 to I5 vote a
motion by Rep. David W. Dennis.
R-lnd.. giving St. Clair the right to
cross-examine witnesses. The only
Republicans voting against cross-
examination were Reps. ~Tom
Railsbuck of Illinois and Hamilton
Fish Jr. of New York.

But the committee approved rules
giving St. Clair the right to question
witnesses and Dennis said later he
believed that would allow the lawyer
to cross-examine them anyway.

Opponents of. the cross-
examination right contended St.
Clair could use it constantly to dis-
rupt the impeachment proceedings
but chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr.
said in response to a uestion during
the meeting that he would not
tolerate any obstruction.

Procedures for the impeachment
proceedings also provide:

-Each‘ member will then have

does not consider signiﬁcant enough
to include in the summary.

-Al'ter that any member may
suggest seeking additional evidence
or witnesses and St. Clair will be in-
vited to do the same.

-St. Clair also would be invited to
supply a response to the committee
staff‘s initial summary of impeach-
ment evidence.

-Rulings on St. Clair‘s speciﬁc
participation at any point in the im-
peachment preceedings would be
made by Chairman Rodino and he
could be overruled by majority vote
of the committee.

The amendment by Rep. Robert
McClory. R-lll.. for live coverage of
any impeachment proceeding open
to the public was quickly approved
with little debate.

But Rodino said staffprcscntation
ofun initial summary of possible im-
peachment evidence to the com-
mittee next week will not be open to
the public.

He refused to speculate on how
soon expanded evidence presenta-
tion meetings in the following weeks
will become open.

Presidential counselor Dean
liurch told newsmen earlier that the
White House would have no objec-
tion to live television coverage ofthe
proceedings.

Nixon Didn’t Take Watergate Seriously

by Richard Pyle
Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON Al’rv'l'he
transcript of taped White House
conversations. released Tuesday. in-
dicates that President Nixon didn‘t
take the Watergate affair very
seriously for several monthsal‘terthc
break-in on June l7. I972.
In a telephone conversation on

tScptember [5 of that year at the

height of his own campaign for re-

election Nixon advised then At‘

torney General John Mitchell:
"Just don‘t let this keep you or

-your colleagues from concentrating

on the big game. l’ltis thing is just
one of those side issues and a month
later everybody looks back and
wonders what all thcshouting was

about."

He closed the conversation by tell-
ing Mitchell. “(let a good night‘s
sleep. And don't bug anybody
without asking me. Okay?"

The same day Nixon told some
aides. “We are all in it together.,This
isa war. Wetakea few sole and' ‘

“is a killer." and if White House
counsel John Dean was guilty. “then
half the staff is guilty...and frankly
then I have been since a week ago.
two weeks ago...“

The latter remark apparently grew
out of expressed agreement by Nix-
on and his top assistants that they

be over. We will give them a .1! hadn‘t moved fast enough to deal

shots and it will be over. Do“
worry. I wouldn‘t want to be on the'
other side right now. Would you?“

lint seven months later. Nixon
was confronted with the full story
not only of Watergate but ofalleged
attempts by some of this top aides
and associates. Mitchell included. to
cover it up.

Mitchell‘s case. he said to his two
top White House aides on April 14.

with information about the cover-up
that was then coming to thesurl‘ucc.
“ And three days later. in u conver-
itlon with Deputy Attorney
(icnerttl Henry Petersen. he referred
to the Watergate burglars as
“juckasses.” Gordon Liddy. he said.
“is crazy." Mitchell “wasn't minding
the store." and Jeb Mttgruder. Depu-
ty Director of the Re-election Com-
mittee. was a “weak fellow."

Council Has Final Meeting; Hear Farewell Messages

by Daniel Gaines

This year's Central Council met
for the last time Wednesday and
heard farewell messages from their

Chairperson Eric Lonschcin and SA

President Steve Gerber

Counctt also apparently laid 'down
a strict policy of not permitting SA'J‘
"giveaways" (letting group members
have old or used materials) by pass—
ing a bill insisting that two IFG pro-
jectors already possessed by IFG
members be either purchased from
SA or else they would I'recrchG‘s
l‘)74-75 budget.

A lrorcn budget means that the
group cannot spend any money in

one or more lines; this bill was
directed toward their equipment
line.

In his statement. Gerber said in
part. “I think it‘s important that stu-
dent leaders pick which walls they
are going to bang their heads
against. not that necessarily all walls
are removable. but rather that there
is a limited amount of energy with
wltich to tnove them.

Mr. Longschcin reflected on the
Council‘s activities. successes and
luilures. and discussed some of the
personal feelings expressed in his
column in the editorial pages.

The Supreme Court wants film like “the good ole days’:
So here It Is . ..

lllSI' FROM THE 30’s!

Council received a memorandum
earlier in the day from departing
Comptroller liob Kanarck. It con-'
cerned “A closing , note of un—
paralleled success“ and said in part:

"For the first time in our history
our audit will be clean...il' and when
we need to borrow money (the sur-
plus won‘t last forever) we should
have no problems and have
luvoruble rates."

Ile said later in the document that

hethuuked the Council for “trusting
the to the point where lcould assume
the job which taught me so muclt..‘.."

Council also defeated a bill in-
troduced by Ken Stokcm. Rich Gor-
don. and Lew llarr calling for the
censure ol SA Supreme Court
Justice Steve Meyer for not
i'csigning lrom the court when run-
ning for office. for releasing con-
fidential information to the public.
and for speaking aboutthe case out-
side of chambers. The bill failed
because there were no charges of any
substance. because the defendant
was not aware of all the possible
.clturgcs (the subpoena was open-
cndcd ). and because the case had no
evidence. only a clash of attitudes.

Another justice‘s case was of a
similar mtturc but was handled in the
some Imtnncr. l'hc justice was Andy
Iinuman.

Council also passed bills concer-
ning Athletic Advisory lioard
