Kent

by Curt Llehler i' 
(CPS) - May 4‘. I974 marks the
fourth anniversary of the l3-second

’rille barrage which left four Kent

State University students dead and
nine wounded. The shootings oc-
curred during a demonstration
protesting tlte US invasion of Cam-
bodia.

The ensuing years saw the tireless
efforts of parents and friends of the
dead and wounded to obtain a full
investigation into the tragedy met
with varying degrees of hostility and
indifference on the pttrt of govern-
ment officials. Confusion surround-
ed the questions ofwho fired the first
shot and why any gunfire was
necessary at all that day.

“The National Guard should have
shot all the trouble makers." said
Scabury I-‘ord. special prosecutor for
the Ohio grand jury that exonerated
the guard from any blame and in-
dicted 25 students. faculty and
"agitators" in connection with the
deaths.

“For every student bent on
violence there‘s a brutal policeman
waiting for him.“ William Saxbctotd
the American Bar Association two
days after the shootings. “They‘re
meant for each other and they‘ll find
each other.“

“the facts available to me support
the conclusion reached by the
President‘s Commission on Campus
Unrest that the rilleftrc was
“unnecessary. unwarranted and in-
excusable." said Atty. Gen John
Mitchell in announcing that he
would not seek a federal grand jury
investigation. Mitchell explained

there was no eyidcnce of a con-
spiracy‘to shoot students and no
likelihood of successful
prosecutions.

But protests. petition campaigns.
and lawsuits continued. Kent State.
as one high Justice Department of-
ticial put it. was “a case that would
just not stay closed.“ ,

In August 1973. the Justice
Department reopened? its investiga-

tion into the shootings and four .

months later called for» the long-
hoped for federal grand jury. Assist:
Atty. Gen. J. Stanley Pottinger
described the primary focus of the
federal panel as “to get the truth.“

On March 29. I974. the 23-
niember grand jury indicted eight
former guardsmcn. none higher in
rank than sergeant. on charges of
violating the students‘ civil rights.

- 'l'he Daily/(em SIa/ar said the in-
dictments could “prove the key to a
‘l’andora‘s liox‘ linking responsibili-
ty for the guards actions to National
(iuard and civilian officials ignored
by the grand jury.“

On April 17 the Supreme Court
ruled that the parents of three ofthe
dead students could seek damages
against those they claim were
responsible for the killings——Ohio
(iov. John Rhodes. National Guard
Adjutant General Sylvester Del Cor-
so. Assist. Adjutant Robert Canter-
bury. Kent President Robert White.
and four other guard officers.

“This may be the ﬁrst step toward

making those personsl-who may be

‘ultirnately responsible‘ for the
deaths of four students and the in-
juring of nine others liable for their

. we}. . i .
actions." said the Kent Slater. Th
recent indictments and court
decisions. however. left still basically
unanswered the questions of why
earlier federal investigations were
dropped. why information discoun-
ting the guardsmen‘s claims their

lives were endangered prior to the
shootings was withheld from the
original state grand jury. whether or
ttot tlterc was a conspiracy formed
moments before the shooting sto
shoot students. and what. in fact.
really happened at Kent State on

plain reasons for the continued
presence of Reservcol'licer 'l'raining

White never made it to the Moti-
day rally. but the university could
hardly help but know at the planned
demonstration. to the crowd at the
time of the rally were several police
informants and [honors Kelly. a
government intelligence officer.
