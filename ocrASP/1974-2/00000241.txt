The paper, which is in its l'ourth

plans for a twelve page national
supplement to college newspapers.
S/iiril editor (iary Ricciardi describ-
ed the supplement as “a journal of
politics and the arts.“

The supplement will include such
things as a story on Elvis Presley.
and interviews with noted figures
like Jack Anderson and Ramsey
('Iark.

In general. the editors plan lol' the
new paper to project a liberal oili-

sion of the Washington Park Spirit.
with the creation" of a national
supplement for‘college newspapers.
follows closely on the heels of
rumors that the ‘paper was ap-
proaching bankruptcy.

When questioned about this.
cdimrllicciardi said the paper had
been experiencing a seasonul’slumpI
He said the extraordinary financial
difficulties of late were the result ol'a
generally bad year economically. in
coitibitialion with the advertising
slump alter Christmas.

lhe paper was lifted from the
depths of poverty by donations
totaling around $3000. And a large
part ol the Sltltltl cattle truth the Stil-
dent Association at Albany State.

A New York State Assemblyman
who has had practical publishing ex-
perience helped the Spiril plan its
current national venture. according
to the editorial ill the May I-l4 issue
ol the .S‘pirt'l. which announced the
e\paeision plans.

I he editorial lurther underscored
what l<iceiardi said about the
Spirit‘s local coierage. “We still need
sustaining contributions: we still
need aIi increase iti subscriptions.“ it
slated. ‘II the supplement isa finan-
cial stlcces owcvcr. the Spirit will
not need to "burden its readership

’with‘ heart-wrenching tales 'ot‘;iis
ﬁnancial woes‘ for some time to
come." ' '

'l'he editorial-says ol' the Spirit's
ﬁnancial status“At present. it looks‘
as it the Spiril may be at the start ol‘a
ﬁnancially secure lil'e. Not too secure.
We hope because toomuch security
will make us fat and sluggish. Too
much security will make us look like
the slack-jawed. pul'l‘y-eycd
politicians we have taken profane

joy in earicattiring for the past four

years.“

“Iliit too little security." it con-
tinues. “leads to cynicism and itil'l'ec-
iii cness. and that is' condition far

The editoritil c m but,

Ricciardi is optimistic about the
I'utiire ol' the limiting/on ' I’urk
S/ilril. II‘ the local expansion comes
about. the circulation iscxpcctcd to
increase he says. Currently mostol'
the : S/iiril readers are state workers.

Marcbi Assaults Mandatory Tax

by (iruci Mastalli
(CPS) - Legislation has been ill-
troduccd in the New York State
Legislature which would ban the use
of mandatory student fees for stil-
dciil newspapers at every State Un-
iversity (SUNY)and City University
(CUNY) campus in the state.
Sponsored by State SenatorJohn
Murcbi (R-Wcstchester), the bill,

which was approved by the NY.

Senate‘s Higher Education Com-
mittee April II. has considerable
conservative support in both houses
ol the legislature.

"Use ol student activity lees l'or sup-

port ol studctit neWspapers in certain,

cases at public colleges arid other

are largely supported by stttdent

Opponents to the bill have
characterized it as a blatant attempt
to cripple student newspapers at
state supported schools dtte to cer-
tain allegedly pornographic material
printed in a student newspaper
recently.

Conservatives in support of the
Marclii bill said that many student
newspapers “claiming the special
protection ol' l'rcedom ol‘ the press
liaie printed obscene material.
published articles Icicliiig near-
libelous cril' ism at national and
