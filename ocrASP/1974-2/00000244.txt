“Satanism,” from "Exorcism" t0'
"Witchcraft," mysteries which have
intrigued and haunted humanity
since time immemoriul are covered

Magic. Ot‘t'll/II.\‘III and Parap-
sw'h‘o/vgy. edited by Richard Caven-

As ProT.J.B.Rhine. the founder of
parapsychology and world-famous
for his expericments in telepathy and
precognition. notes in his introduc-
tion. "This is a most unusual volume.
In it are listed scores of the strangest
topics imaginable. fantastic claims
about man and his nature and
destiny that in the past have been
banned by Churches. .goyernments
or schools. and hidden from the
young at home and in the public
library. They have been ignored and
scorned by scientists. Now. however.

they are assembled and conveniently
listed with readable articles for the
growing number of people who are
curious.“

Concise and lively articles, arrang-
ed alphabetically and cross-
rel‘crenced. range comprehensively
over experiments in cxtrnscnsory
perception; the study of" drugs and
dreams; historical mysticism such as
the (.‘abala, witchcraft. alchemy. and
the Tarot: practices like Yoga and
the sexual rites ol~ Tantra: ancient
doctrines such as reincarnation; the
views of believers in curious occult
cosmologics: the results produced by
famous mediums. and the tape
recordings ol‘ ‘spirit voices."
