Politics has helped me mature a
great deal as a person. When you are
in‘public life. you have the privilege

most. You are exposed to many
different types of persons all seeking
to better their own lot in life. The un-
fortunate thing is that many people
don‘tcarellhom they step on in order
to better their position. People don‘t
listen to what others say before they
make their judgments. That's not
fair to themselves or to otherpeople.
People condemn others for things
they would do themselves if they had
the chance.| Do you think there‘s

We all live together here on this
giant concrete slab. Tl'uclit‘s. an ar-
tificial environment. but it‘s really
not an artificial life. In fact.
sometimes it’s all too real. People
are at each other's throats at least as
often here as they are in the outside
world. In fact. here it‘s sometimes
worse because the reasons ' for
hostility are so much more petty.
Why are people like this." our Short

profitable and enjoyable way if we

the basis of your values: that‘s not
really giving him or her a fair shake.
Attempt to see wha that individual is

trying to say on the basis of his or"

her own value system. Instead of
formulating your response while the

The Smiling

"You‘re always smiling,“ Lou

’ lsmay. coordinator of Environmen-

tal Forum. greets me when he walks
into his ofﬁce on the second ﬂoor of
the Fine Ans Building to find me
waiting there for him.
“I think that it‘s got something to
do with this office.“ I respond.
And itdocs. ltis notthateveryonc
who comes in is smiling. Hardly!
Students come in with concerns
rangingfrotn those of a personal
nature to environmental or political
problems. But if you don‘t come in
with a weighty matter on yourmind.
then just to be there is cnougbt to
make you smile.
I arrived at the Environmental
Womb: as a sign on the door calls it-
corly for my 3:30 appointment. I
asked Lou. I had once called him
Mr. lsmay..but that didn‘t- last for
long. Everyone calls him Lou. But
Lou was at a meeting. so lspokc with
two ormtizers of the upcoming on-
campus Earth week. One of them
was curled up in the comfortable
green chair. the other. Dave. rocked
in the swivel executive chair. Dave
was placing calls to Senator Muskie
in Washington and to other public
l'tguresl. in an attempt to find a
keynote speaker. The names of
previous Environmental Forum
speakers on campus were
memorializcd in thcroom.,lettered on
construction paper and hung from i
strings which spanned the ceiling.
l.ou returns. l.ou...a very quiet
man. His face and graying hair show
signs of age. but his eyes and voice.
soft and direct. scent to defy time.

After greeting me. he walks to his
desk to find the afternoon‘s
messages. It has always amazed me
that Lou is able to find his messages
amid the sacttered papers on his
desk. He reads the first mcssagcand
comments: “Isn‘t that nice.“ “0h
l)amn!." he says alter the second
one. the phone rings. "Hi. This is
Queen Elizabeth." he says into the
phone. When the phone call is over.
he says the person on the other end
had introduced himself as King
George.

Lou brings me a cup of tea and
sits in a chair near me.

"Why do you think your office is
so different from many others on this
campus?“ 1 ask. -

Dave interrupts with a depressing
‘report on tltc search for'an Earth
Week speaker: “We have no one.“

Lou recommendscalling Muskie‘s
Maine office. Dave places the call.
“I wonder..." Dave begins. lleis put
on hold by Maine.

"Don‘t wonder." says Lou. “Use
the positive approach. Expect a
favorable reply and you'll get it.
People can read your voice. Dave.
thetrick isto balance yourselfso that
lbad vibes aren‘t given to people;-
Never be nasty. or rude. but sound

Lou apologizes to me as another

people workwith you. When youN

Lou turnsto me. I repeat myqucs-
tion. “Why do you think your office
is different and how did that
difference come about?“

“Take this room.“ he begins. “The
lighting is different.“ (Lou doesn‘t
like fluorescent lights.) “The stuff
around is different. The people who
come here contribute to what‘s
here.“

Lou points out the l’YE symbolof
a green diamond. “Donna's mother
made it." There is a drawing which
reads THINK AR'I‘. “Doris Cowley
made that." Behind a stack of
papers. Lou pulls out an old framed
photograph of a streetcar. There is
also a pink pig mounted on wood. It
was supposed to be an award to
Albany‘s biggest pollutcr. but was
never given. A small. very heavy
cannonball is brought out from un-
der the desk. A large woven rug of
gray background with a geometric
design of black and red hanging on
one wall was given to Lou by his
brother. A lavendcr'mting with
purple rectangles hangs next to the
rug. Lou says it is a portrait of
lttntsclf...“warm with a lot of cool“.
as it was described by tltcr artist.

"You know." Lou concludes.
"hardly a day goes by without alum-
ni calling or dropping by.
Sometimes they have information.
or ask for help. or ol't'cr’bclp."

I get up to leave. lt‘sdinncrtime.
Another student walks in to meet
Lou for a dinner appointment. Lou
introduces us to each other. “Patti
just asked me a question." Lou says
to him. “which I‘m not sure that l
have answered. She asked me why
this office works and how it came
about.“ The student doesn‘t res-
pond: he has something else on his
mind.

I had once asked another student r -~"w'mF

' - A’reeenttr'end’agamst the alleged _. V

evif‘vs”of:the so-called'corporate state '
has been‘v'a marked proliferation of
groups lobbying for something
vaguely.designated the “public in-
tercst." 'l‘hcy arrogantly proclaim
themselves asreprcsenting the will of
the population and the desires of the
common man. whatever that is.
They lobby against other groups.
portraying themselves as Don Quixh
otcs out to'dcfeat the armies of the
purveyors of “special interests.“

‘startdingjtpright and strong for the

protection of the little man against
the pernicious influence of the “big -
moneyed“ interests.

Usually these self - appointed

saviors of mankind. these apostles of

the common good. prevail upon the
lawmakers to protect the “hapless”
consumer against the big business
predators by passing legislation to
regulate and control whatever it is
that our chivalrousltnightsn shining
armor deem is harmful to the “com-
mon cause.“

After looking over the results of
these so—callcd public interest ac-
tions. it is time to ask a few pointed
questions to the leaders of such
groups. What makes you think you
represent the interests of the public
or the cause of the common people?
Who designated you the spokesman
for the public? What makes you
think youractionsare in my interest?

The audaciousncss of the elitists
who run such groups is indeed
remarkable. Recently a public
interest: group at SUNYA had the
presumption to demand that a line
for their organization be placed on
the regular tuition bill which is sent
toalltltestudettts.enablingcach per-
son to more easily contribute histwo
dollars to enhance his public in-

Unfortunately the ltarm done by
'public action groups cart far exceed
that done by the various oddball stu-
dent groups whiclt so enliven cam-
pus ccntcr lobbies with their various
idiosyncratic views of religion.
politics and sex. For the problem is
inherent in the titles with which such
groups label thentsclves. Notice the
prevalence of the words “common”
and "public" and the absence of
words like "personal" and “in-

organirations. They all treat
humanity as some sort of faceless.

wandering aimlessly about for want
of guidance from the exalted leaders
of public interest groups. The rights
and liberties of the pcrson.if the in-
dividual. are buried beneath some
vagueuconception of the rigltts and
welfare of the collective. of the
“masses.” Ofcoursc. there is no such
thing as collective rights. only in-
dividual rights. The collective is
made up of individuals. caclt of
which has certain rights and fiber—
ties. and it is the province of govern-
tttcttt to protect tltesc rights and
liberties. It is useful for would -—“be
tyrants and dcntagogucs. however.
to cloud up the distinction between
the individual and thcgroup in order
to serve their

'l hose who say they are concerned
with the public welfare are often
sincere. just as often ntisguidcd. and
occasionally tyrannical. Old Nazi
l'arly platforms and not so ~- old
Communist Party platforms are
filled with promises of money. jobs.

people with no references to per-
sonal rights and libc‘rtics which. of
course. are ignored if such a party
tries to implement its schemes.

More pertinent to current
problems. however. are movements

of marijuana. ban sales on Sundays.
ban various toys. vitamins. and
automobiles because some crackpot
crusaders have decreed them unsafe

lhc people responsible for these
tyrannical actions have tltc cnor-
mous satisfaction of knowing that
they ltavc the power to regulate an
mtlit‘idual's buying. eating. smoking
and sleeping Ittthits. What a grand
feeling of power they mustpossess!

When the efforts of such groups
are directed toward simply
providing readin accessible
educmion on such tltittgs as dclcc‘
live products and dil'lcring prices in
order to ltelp art individual make in-
telligcttt buying decisions. then a
useful service is being accomplished.
flat when such a group seeks to
