The ﬁrst weekend in May means many things todifferent people——
lots of sun. spring weather, baseball, and an upcoming vacation. But
to as many as twenty-two hopefulhorsetrainers, this weekend could
be the culmination of a lifetime. Yes. horse lovers, tommorrow, May
4th. at Churchill Downs in Louisville. Kentucky,twenty-two horses
or more will run a mile and a quarter in an effort to caputre a record
purse of $25l,500., a blanket of roses. and theil00th Kentucky Der-
by.

There is no standout among this year's crop of three year olds as
there was in I973 when Horse of the Year Secretariat swept the Derby
and the Triple Crown. (The Triple Crown of horse racingincludes the
Kentucky Derby, the one and three-sixteenths mile Preakness at
l’imlico Racetraek in Maryland. and the one and a halfmile Belmont
Stakes at Belmont Racetrack on Long Island). However, there are
four horses who are generally given the best chances of winning
America's most prestigious horse race.

Judger, withjockcy Laffit Pincay aboard willcomprise an entry
with Cannonade, who will beridde by Angel Cordero Jr. Both are
trained by Woody Stephens. as these two will bethe bettingfavorite
as a result of their impressive victories in several three yearold stakes
earlier this spring. Rube the Great. ridden by Miguel Rivera. who
won divisions of the Gotham and Wood Stakes at Aqueduct
Racetrack in New York and Aeeipter, ridden by AngelSantiago, who
won several allowance races a Aqueduct recently, comprise a Sig-
mond Sommer entry and the/Competition. Others in the ﬁeld include
(with jockey in parenthesis): Destroyer (Valenluela)._|.R,‘s Pet (Me
Hargue). Lexieo (Avila). Little Current (Nohoy). Flip Sal (No Boy).
Sharp (iary (No Boy), Buck‘s Bid (Macbeth); Confedervt'tte Yankee
((irant). (iaHai (Manganello), Agitute (ShoctitakcrLand Set N‘ Go
((iividia).

Competition between these horses during the past spring has been
fierce as race after race adifferettt one would win. Mailers were made
ntot' complicated when Protagonist. last year‘s top tWU-ycar old.
developed problems attd fittislted last itt several I‘tlees. Only Judgel‘.
Cannonadc. Rube the (ireat. and Triple Crown (yeti. that‘s the horse‘s
name -—he is also eligible for the Derby) have been able to win more
than olte stake race. |~'or these reasons. this year‘s Derby is wide open
with anyone having a sltot at winning. Asa result, Churchill Downs
may have the biggest field ever to race itt atty of the IOU Derbies.

I'lttndicapping this race is incredibly hard to do due to the record
number of entries. If you remember. last year on these pages I
predicted that Secretariat would win itt Kentucky and the rest of tfte
Triple Crown even though lie was coming off of a loss in the Wood
Melttorial to Sham and Angle l.igltt.. Not wanting to rest on my
laurels. I intend to select this year‘s winner. loo. The pick is Catt-
nottade. with Aceiptcr second and .ltidgcr third. My reasoning is as
follows: .Iudget'. who likes to lay last until half of the race is over. will
have tons of traffic problems goingarottnd at least twenty—one other
horses. Accipter will probably be ttcar or setting the pace while Can-
nonade. with a great closing kick. figures to be lit the middle of the
pack with less horses to pass than .Intfget'.

Two Racer

The Albany State Women's
Varsity Track and Field squad
fell to the Cherokee Track Club
of Springﬁeld College in a dual
meet at Albany on Tuesday, but
the SUNYA tracksters broke
two school and track records in
the meet. New marks were set by
Vicki Girko in the discus and by
Anita Bobersky in the javelin.
Despite these ﬁne performances.
the team could not overcome the
effectsof injuries to several key
runners, and the powerful
Cherokees out ran Albany to
take firsts in all of the running
events. The ﬁnal meet score was
Springfield 89, Albany 47.

Anita Bobersky‘sjavelin heave
of fox‘ 8 3/4" was good for a
strong win over Buckley of SC
who threw 82‘. Bobersky. who
threw l30' at the age of I4,accor-
ding to Albany coach Barbara
Palm, is still not in top throwing
form after being in an accident
last fall. Besides winning the
javelin. she took third in the l00
yard dash.

Albany discus thrower Vicki
(iirko was tops in her event as
site set the new school and track
record of [07‘ to heat l‘erscchino
of SC who had a l(l5‘ 4". Vicki
took third place in the mile run as

Yes ASP readers, there is a
tennis team at Albany State,
althouin this may be the first

tinte you‘ve read about it here. .

Maybe you know them as the

guys dressed in white, wlto‘

always secttt to be on the Indian
Quad courts on tftose nice warm
days when you want to play. But
the teattt is also out there when
the weather is bad.

Coach Bob Lewis‘ determina-

well. Mary Beck of SUNYA took
third in the discus with 88‘ 2 l/ 2".

Another valuable field events
scorer was Bernita McCormack.
who tooksecond inthe highjump
and third in the shot put.

The . running events saw
Springﬁeld taking all of the ﬁrst
places. as that team had its best ‘
meet of the year. Albany was
plagued by injuries. Ann Rugh,
who has been training since last
fall for the track season. was kept
out of the mile. 880. and 2-mile
because of an ankle injury. This
injury has hindered her all

,through the season. She would

have been a potential winner in

these events, having been in top

shape from fall cross country.

She has run a 5:40 mile in prac-

tice, and has run inAAcross coun»
try meetsAnother casualty was

sprinter Liz Naylor, who was

sick and could not compete.

Coach Palm noted that she
had to change her usual relay
entrants due to an tiniury to Con-
nie 'l‘rikoukas who runs the
dashes and botlt relays. Connie
did enter the 220, taking seeortd.
bttt was not up to her usual f’orm.‘
SC Won the 440 as well as the
medley relays.

Another second place winner '
for Albany was Mary Ellen
Foley, who fought a hard neck-
and-neck battle withILamsdenof'
SC in the 880. to lose by a stride,
in 2238.9. Lamsden had 2:38.55

Third place ﬁnishers ere Foley
and Julie Acton. who tied for
third in the too meter hurdles.
.Iulie Favi'eau in the 220. and Ac-
ton in the 440. Fourth places
were taken by Sharon Preston in
the long jump. Sylvia Cun-
ningham in the I00. Mary Amie '
Kennedy in the mile, and
Maurine Mauro in the 440. Meet
scoring 5.3.2. and l points for
first through fourth places
respectively, and relays scored 5
and 3.

Last Saturday the women's
track squad went to Cortland for
the Cortland llnvitationals.
There they took third place
overall beating Cornell and
Ithaca in the process. The
women‘s performance at that
meet was all the more impressive
due to the fact that only ten
athletes could be taken on the
trip. The other teams iii the meet
were Southern Connecticut and
Cortlandavhichtook first and se-
cond respectively.
