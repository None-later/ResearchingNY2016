Albany ,State‘s’traek‘ team had

its easiest victory of the season

Wednesday, as they trounced
lightly regarded Plattsburgh by a
score of "8 to l5. Many of the
team's top performers were given
the meet off in order to be Well-
rested 'for this Saturday’s
SUNYAC championship. to be
held at Plattsburgh.

The host school. unfortunate-
ly. is not representative of much
of the competition Albany will
face in the meet. Cortland,
Brockport (defending champ).
and Oswego all have men
capable of taking big points
away from Albany. Even in
Wednesday‘s dual meet held here
at Albany. Plattsburgh did dis-
play that ability.

Albany won each ofthe [6 first
places. l0 of l4 seconds. and 80f
ll thirds in racking up their
highest point total of the year.
The victory was also Albany‘s
29th in a row. tying the team‘s
and the school's record for con-
secutive dual meet victories.
Next week. they can set a new
one with a victory at Hartwick.

Sticlzmen Fail Again

The Albany State lacrosse was
looking foward to returning to
home turf Wednesday. They had
spent their. last three games on
the road and had lost the last
two. The team hoped that being
home would change their luck“
But things didn‘t Work out that
way. as Albany lost to a tough
Hartwick team. l3-6.

It was a cool windy afternoon.
as Albany prepared to take the
field. The Ateam‘s instructions
from. Coach Armstrong
appeared simple: Hit' them and
make them hurt.

The team came out very
aggressively. displaying some
ﬁne body checks. It‘s really
.(prisindhow much punishment
these .- must take.

Play in the early going was
fairly even. Albany. though. was
hampered by their lack of shots
at Hartwick’s goaltender. The
stickmen would come down and
setup. They would take only one
shot and 'Hartwick would be on
the attack. Hartwick , on the

sprint was 9.9 seconds, his best
mark of the year, as he was
followed by teammates Harvey
Sobol (l0.l) and Bill Brown
(104). T oni Cleary set a season‘s
best throw of I78 feet, 2 inches.
as he won the javelin.

Paul Gutinan grabbed tw0
wins for State. winning the shot
put (44‘. 3“)and the discus(135').
He 'will be counted on heavily
Saturday. especially in the later
event. Jim Holloway should be
right with Gurman in both events
also. as he was against
l’lattsburgh. taking second in
each.

An encouraging sign for
Albany was in the high jump.
Although Jan Giga only jumped
IS‘ “A” to win. he did it running
right into the teeth'of the wind.
Coach Bob Munsey is pleased
just to have (iiga competing
again. since a knee injury had
sidelined him for over a month.

Most of Albany‘s battles for
first place involved members of
their own teams. Phil Sullivan
(4248.9) bested Jim Stacy byjust
over a second in the mile. Bob
Malone bested Lee Kardas by
just 2/l0ths of one in the l20-
yard hurdles. Bob Eberlein (55. I)
upset Orin Griffin (55.8) in the
440. Giga picked up his second
win inthe triplejump by lessthan

otherhand. would get numerous
shots at the net.

Hartwick grabbed a H) lead,
but Albany was able to tie the
score in an extra man situation.
Hartwick soon started to
dominate play and started pull-
ing away. The Danes purious
defense let Hartwick penetrate
too frequently and that was the

been playing in State University

may want to hum a few bars of “Love
