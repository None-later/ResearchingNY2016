Students the idea that the ‘child
remains within all of us.” This is but
one of the many thoughts offered,
over the past seven years. to the
students 'of Dr] Curtis C. Smith.
Assistant Professor of English at
. Albany State" University. His con-
cepts have touched upon subjects
ranging from the science ﬁctional
woi’k’i'of Stapledon to the theories of
Marlll‘ﬁl’s energies directed against
institutions such as corporate
economy. university deansl. and the
tenure system.

He has been a man diverser look-
ed upon. To some on the Board of
Trustees he is both a dangerous
Marxist radical and an anarchist

students he is simply a bright. easy-

as he tsfiutione more casualiy of that

his situation.

Our HP-45 is one of two rite-programmed scientific pocket-sized

3. It displays up to 10 significant digits in either fixed-decimal or

Our HP-35 is the other. It handles 22 functions, has one Addressable

Both Professor Bernard .lohnpoll
and University President Louis T.
Benezet spoke to about ten people
last Wednesday as part of a sym-
posium sponsored by the Academic
Activities Committee. My ﬁrst ques-
tion was. “What is this committee?“

According to the posted fiyer. the
Committee formed in February to
“provide a forum for scriousdiscus-
sion of issues.“ 'lTieLgroup lclulm‘s‘
that discussion 15 stopped in th__e
classroom. and lhata place is needed
for students to "investigate “the
problems facing our people so that
they can consciously organize to.
solve them."

According to Pete 'I'omiscz. the
group was formed by progressive
students and faculty members. in—
cluding Curt Smith of the English
Department. l’cte is neither student
our faculty. He defined himself as a
Marxist-Leninist. Aha! I thought.
An outside agitator.

Both .lohnpoll and Benczet
speculated that the sunshine kept the
students away from their lectures.
Are they right or are students just
not interested in discussing the con-

what this university is all about and
why we are here is too abstract and
removed from our daily lives on

.lohnpoll arrived to discuss “The
Administration Against Education."
The former journalist called higher
education at SUN YA a “rip-off“and
usserted that more money is spent.
here on administration that on
education. He said that deans and
laid ministrators are people who. un-

qualified to teach. became wrapped\

up in the world ol'buretiucrucy.and
dumped on President Benezct and
Vicc- President for Academic Al'-
fuirs. l'hil Sorotkin.

“I think the mainjob that most ad-
ministrators do on this campus is
handout rooms for take-home ex-
ams." .lohnpoll said. “I really can‘t
see what other purpose
scrvc...but they‘ve got a goddamned
u mount of power.

Part of the problem. Johnpoll'
believes. is that we put too much
store in degrees. Calling the Phi).
"counterproductive". he said it
hinders one in finding ajob in many
areas. He also criticized teaching
subjects which led to bureaucracy.

to the members of the faculty and say
look you jerks. you run this school.
It would be a catastrophe because.
most of this faculty is too stupid to
_know what it‘s doing".

The disillusioned professor
vehentently pointedout what he sees
as the problem at the university. “A.
university is supposed to be a com-
munity of scholars.” he thundered.“
and there isn‘t a goddamn scholar in
the administration building today!”
Frustrated. yet dynamic. .lohnpoll
concluded confused: “I can no
longer say what education is."

The discussion began and Pete.
the Murxist-Leninist managed to
make the conversation more
political than educational. The view
of the university as a processing
center for perpetuating the
Capitalist classes was brought up
and the need for change discussed.

While mixing education with
politics I decided to scurry over to
the People for Socialism (another
Faculty-Student group) Open forum
on Miseducation. (cutting a class to
do so). 'l‘hcir signs using the word
“mind-raping" helped draw about
twenty people to this discussion.
Students and faculty members dis-
cussed values. cducation. and. of
course. politics. in a “consciousness~
raising" effort.

that the money spent on the goose-

halting voice. mostly to the
blackboard on which he illustrated
the essence of his message in his
"doodle".

According to Benezet. the univer-
sity student has many options as to
his purpose in being there. ’l‘heseare:

Community Service or PlRG:-'ihA-‘

The various rules a university may
play are complementary to this. The
university may: develop resources
for society: play politics (such as

competing with other institutions for .

money): produce professional
ltrianagcrs. or resource allocation;
strive towards intellectual prestige;
concentrate on campus governance;

ttnd intellectual growth. My pet;
ticipation in campus and community
activities. and a year of introspection
involved me in the political. social.
and philisophical options, which cer-
tuinly qualify as education.

Pete. the Marxist-Leniniat.
brought up again the class structure
and Capitalist functions of the un- ,
iversity. Benezet'very amicany ad-
mitted to holding a position which
perpetuated Capitalism. the best
system to his.knowledge.

l emerged, from these three con-
secutive. discussions, , on education
mont: confused that not. All had been
sponsored byHSpcialtstLgiroups. All
turncltxtnt‘t‘i the political ulse ofthe un-
iversity. All were sparcei'y'attended.

l’erhaps 'ihere wasn‘t enough
publicity. it was the wrong time of
day. or .lohnpoll. Benezet. and Peo-_
pic for Socialism lack drawing
power. Perhaps only Socialists want
to discuss education and politics.
Can the educational system be dis-'
cussed without bringing in politics?

I've decided that one‘s views on
education will be inextricably linked

‘lwithg one‘s political views. since
education 'is u perpetuation of
something. I still haven‘t come to
any conclusions on what education
really is or what political system
could best administer it. I researched
the literature in the area and it seems
that the authorities differ about the
not new questions of “What is
education!“ and “What should a un-
iversity be‘!“. But I guess I stopped
long enough toithipk about why I‘m
here; I‘m content with the answers.

Now I must confess that ldid not
attend these discussions due to my _

' avid interests in these abstractions.
but because I have to write ti paper
