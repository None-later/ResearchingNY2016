J. Vanderbilt Strawb is a'rich Albany conservative businessman who also happens.

to be on the SUNYA Board of Trustees. also known as the' UniversityCouncil. Over
the summer. with‘the complicity of President Louis 1‘. Benezet. Strawb will hand pick
his' Presidential search committee. He will stock it with other local rich. conservative.
anti-student. self-serving businessmen. who will not give a damn about the working
v qualities of the new President. but rather how well he will mold the to the upper class

4 style that Strawb and his crew would like lo see set in the Administration at. this institu-

tion. ., ,
The Administration reports that they are circulating letters to all faculty members
advising them to nominate members of their ranks to run in an election to determine
sis) names that will be sent to the Council. The", Council will have the power to select
L from that list any one orall ol‘them to serve on the Council‘s Search Committee.
Huy‘l'his entire procedure has the all too familiar smell of tokenism. For the purpose of
pyjesenting a superficially equitable Search Committee. the Board of'l'rustees. itt all of
,its infinite selfish wisdom. will permit some faculty. (ofcourse the Board willdetermine
who of the winners will serve) and perhaps even a student or so to complete the window
dressing. l'hatIis not sufficiently egalitarian to ensure that the wisest decisions will be
made concerning the new President. The Search Committee will still look much more
like Strawb‘s hand - picked plums than anytrue representation of uiiivei'sit)"interest.
Over the summer. there will be no students to voice their input. no faculty to make
suggestions. r )thing to impede the coercive progress which the Administration would
like to utilive so that they can presciittus with avl'uil ar'r'miip/iin September. They have
been planning this note foi'lquite iiliwliile. The signs have been evident for months. the
appointment by. the Board o‘f'J'l’rustees of Richard Kendall to the Deanship of the
Division of Behavioral Arts‘ and Sciences will likewise be made over the summer. when
there are no students. no faculty. nothing to mar the perfection ofthe Administration.
Finally. Bcnezet. by announcing his resignation effective next July. has avoided a
detailed review of liisrAdministration but instead has asked that his own university
conduct a policy review ofhislive year reign. If thatreview board will also consist of
his favorites. the StUdcnlS‘Cilll rest assured that nothing constructive will emerge from
their deliberatioris’t The Benezet years will look so rosy. so idyllic. so surrealistic that
the students will want to know why they were denied the privilege of attending
lieiie/et‘s Albany State.

An End....A Beginning

.

For some. the ‘nd of this semester represents the beginning ofa new life. while for
others it is simply} another semester break. a short pause in the continuous process of
education that for some reason or another must be undertaken. For still others the end
of the semester l‘rings only a large and menacing question mark.

We congratula c this year‘s graduating class. We congratulate those who know what
professional or raduate school they will attend or wha’tjob they will have. We hope
they are doing try at they really want. for we know all too well that many in America are
not pleased with their positions in society. It is important to realize. however. that your
happiness dcpuhds on ntore than position alone: your attitude is also essential.
Remember that if you can‘t get what you want. you can still be happy with what you
Itave. I

to those who are graduating and do not know to what that will lead them. we lend
courage. For those who cannot be personally secure in their future. we suggest that you
not panic. Eteryonc finds his place.

Some of you are leaving with a germ of an idea. a plan that hopefully will one day
bloom into the ideal business. book. or other creation. A few are offto a distant place.
a new home. and a new life.

I l‘or the rest of us it is business as usual. Mostwill have a job this summer. many will
be in school or travelling. still others will be idle. The summer will last a long time;
there is tiiuch of valuefor you tolcarn and experience. Idleness "an be valuable too; iii-
deed wc believe all should have a few blank weeks every few years.

~ the ASI' wishes all a good day. a good summer. a good life.

A Young View of Washington .

Is Justice’s Machinery Creaking?

 

In the last two decailchhe number of cases
on the Supreme Court docket has very nearly
ti'iplchnd in the last four years. the number
ol cases in federal district courts has increased
by more than I0.000 per year. to a total of
t43.2|o last year.

the problem of crowded court dockcts is
not new. but. at least in the eyes of'some ex-
perts. it is on the verge of becoming particular-
ly acute. these experts point to the explosive
rate ol growth in court business in the last two-
to-live years. and to indications that the rate
will continue to rise for the loresccahle future.

(hit: of those concerned is Chief Justice
Warren Ii. liurger. who last year established a
blue ribbon Study (irotipon the Caseload of
the Supreme Court. The group was chaired
by Professor Paul A. lireund of Harvard Law
School. and its members all are well-known
and highly respected both within and without
the legal coriimuriity. Al'tera full year of work.

of a new National Court.dcsigned to relieve
tIiejusticcs of much ofthe screening of cases
that now. according to some. takes too much
time away from their consideration of already
pending business.

Many members of the legal profession have
attacked that proposal and on tivariety of
grounds. One of the most cogent and per-
suasive of them. it seems to me. is that the es-

 To‘ Forgive, Divine

lo the I-Zdltor:

The fact that it surfaces all kinds of con-
trasting emotions. that politicians tell us that
the time is not ripe. that Richard Nixon's per-
sonal mess requires that he court any and all
right wing support. and any or more of a bun-
dred other reasons cannot allow us to deviate
front the dogged pursuit ofamnesty for people
who could not bring themselves to participate
in that tragic and obscene Vietnam war.No
one can predict how long it will take to
generate public opinion and thereby move
Congress. but that is not the real issue. We
Iiave to "hang in" on this issue for however
long it takes simply because it is the right and
decent thing to do.

At this point in time. We are not even asked
to evaluate every notice of those who dodged.
resisted. fled. deserted. etc. My personal sym-
pathies lie in the conviction that the civil dis-
obedience of these young men was forced on
them because of their enlightened insight
tlirouglt the liesand incredible confusionsthat
we were asked to swallow.Many young men
whom I personally knew felt a strong
allegiance to a more fundamental and impor-
tant law which their consciences would not
allow them to suppress. but whatever their
motive was. even if they \vcrejust plain scared.
our first task is to Iieal attd hind up wounds.

throughout the week of May (i to It). a
grottp of conegrncd people will be staffing an
Amnesty Table at the Campus Center to enlist
campus support. to share information. to in-
terview Vets. and to iiiundate Congress with
our reasoniiigs and demands. Although it is a
busy time for everyone. please 'join us'.

A Parting Tribute

to the Editor:

It is my iiitcntionto make a final statement
as retiritig President oftltc International Film
tiroup. l was iiifd'riried about the May lst
Central Council meeting as I am informed
about iitost S.A. meetings lam expectedto at-
tend: approximately four hours in advance.
Unfortunately. I had other commitments that
could not be broken. I wish that I could have
attended. as I would ltave liked to address to
the Council these comments. as a concluding
remark on four years‘ service to Student
Association; on three years as President ofone
of their organilations. Instead. I gave this
statement to my colleagues to read to the
Council. l'lieir refusal to let the statement be
read I can take only as an affront to the Inter-
national Film Group. a personal affront to
myself. and an example ofthe lack of respon-
sibility and responsiveness I have been faced
with lrom Student Association for four years.

I have decided. itisteiid. to present it publicly.
in the hopes that niuclt of the I.F.(i. audience
will also see it.

I find it an insult to the International Film
(iroup. and worse. an insult to our audience.
to show the films we show on outdated and un-

'usahlc equipment. It degrades the tremendous
amount of time that goes into the production
of a leature film as well as the tremendouj
amount of time put in by myself. over fou
years. itnd Mr. Dougherty and Mr. Newman

over the last two years. The five or so people
who could he said to be working for IFG at
any one time work hard. not only on the
evenings of the screenings. but all week. dorng
things and preparing things that no other film
group on campus would bother wnli. Perhaps.
in this respect. they are right: The audience

 

doesn‘t need pro—show music picked par-
tictilarly to serve the mood of the film. it
doesn‘t need to see the films uninterrupted by
faulty reel changes.

this. Mr._ Eiehhom. and his Ali-ny Slit -
Cinema. I would charge. have accepted these '
neglects as basic truths.

V I cannot enumerate how many times. and in.
what amounts. Mr. Dougherty and l have
used our owu money to obtain materials
relating to IFG. However. for starters. our
own personal equipment was down at the lee-
ture center for every screening. in order to
provide pre-show music. and. occasionally.
any sound at till. During the course ofthe last
two years. damage and aging. through use of
this equipment. has taken place. Our own
money was sunk into tapes. records. materials
for the showing of silent films. and all sorts of
publicity materials over the last two and four
years by Mr. Dougherty and myself respec-
tively. I would say that. in the course of the
four years I have been involved with the
group. particularly in ‘70-‘7l and '7l—‘72. I‘d
spent $70 to Stilt) total to see IFG work the
way I believed it was set up to work. I‘m sure.
in Albany State Cinema. the problem has
never come up.

0' Student Association finds the Inter-
national Film (iroup to be unnecessary to the
campus community at large. if they find that
an organization dedicated to serving a
dignified audience is out of place here. ifthey
expect to continue their begrudging semi-
sttpport ol our organilation. then it is proud
enough. and secure enough in its goals. to con-
tinue. here or elsewhere. without Student
Association. they need only tell its.

As I retire as president. I would like to ad-
dress Iliis message to our audience. as well as
to Student Association:

| reluse to let the organization I have
dedicated nty time. money. atid love to for
four years do anything half-assed. They will
use the best projection equipment available to
them. the best prints of the finest films. and
they will show them under the best possible
conditions. whether it be in Albany. New
York. or Nome. Alaska: whether their
endeavors be financed by a willing Student
Association. a graitt or fellowship in the Arts.
or by shovelling sitow and raking leaves.
Maiiy people have dedicated themselves to a
cause: to serve the audience. and the creative
artists who have made the films. Our purpose
will not be swayed by bureaucrats. members of
other orgaiii/ations. oranyoneelsc. We need
answer only. morally. to our own film
Iteritage. our own traditions of past presidents
and co-workers in serious film societies
around the country. and our own pride and
conscience as presenters of an art form. and as
aesthetic human beings.

La Dolce Vita

lo the Editor:

We would like to addressthis lettertoa par—
ticular prolessor in the Italian-Hispanic
Department who deserves to be commended.
'l hrough his total dedication and enthusiasm.
Iie has not only been able to TEACH us the
fundamentals of the Italian language but has
also instilled iii usa special love forthc culture.
the classroom atmosphere is one not often
found at this tiniversitymhis ability and desire
to transmit his knowledge has made us willing.
and eager to learn.

We would just like Dr. Cheruhini to know
that we appreciate him and we thank him for
making this year such a valuable learning ex-
perience. We hope that those who are lucky
enough to work with this great man in the
future are big enough to value and appreciate
him. We hate to see hint leave us. It is unfor-
tunate that our department didn't appreciate
him.

Witli best wishes for your future.

In LeComte’s Interest?

To the Editor:

I would like to thank Douglas Le Comte for
his mature and well-thoughtout appraisal of
the field of public interest work in Friday's
ASP. I assume Mr. Le Comte LIKES getting
ripped-off at the superniiirketand purposeful-
ly (iIV ES his younger siblings the most
dangerous playthiiigs Iie can find just to make
it ptiiiit.

to losdl'hiii isgshovm by Chancellor Boyer‘n re-
cent inexplicable'Edeeiiiion t‘o tilt'e' away our
local public interest group‘s proposed funding
system. In fact. in light-of that quitc'un-
democratic verdict (the majority of SUNYA‘

students have already pledged theirsupport '

for PIRG). I would additionally like to thank
Mr. Le Comte for waiting until the organiza-
tion was down on the ground before he kicked
it in its crotch.

In his printed crusade. columnist Le Comte
questions the “personal” interests involved in
the efforts of the public interest volunteers. I
would like to tttkethe opportunity to question
MR. LE COMTE‘S personal interests in
writing such it bitter and damning article.
Perhaps he wants to publicly show that he is
"above" succumbing to faddish trends such as
those challenging the "system" in the interest
of the common good. What a grand feeling of
power he must possess!

And what makes Douglas Le Comte think
HE is acting in the majority‘s Interest by
writing such one-sided and pessimistic ur-
ticles‘.’ Furthermore. why isn‘t H E out working
tjl further his ideologies (such as those per-
taining to consumer education) instead of sit-
ting in his room writing about them‘! The
current campus “self-appointed saviors of
mankind.“ as he terms them. are “self-
appointed“ because it is THEY who are will-
ing to get up offthcir assesand work. Anyway.
no one is forcing anyone to participate orcven
read the results of I’IRG price studies.

Once again. thank you. Mr. Le Comte. for
showing the “otherside” of the issue. I’IRG at
Albany is currently II crippled organization
due to the lack ofan adequate funding system.
I'm sure you are very delighted and quite
satisfied. It's nice to see that somebody is.

Social DiseaSes

'lo the Editor:

It was an honor to have been a delegate to
the recent N.Y. State Convention that
nominated John Emanuel as the SOCIALIS‘I',
LABOR I’ARTY candidate for Jouvcmor
and Robert E. Massi as the SLP
candidate for US Senator. Both candidates
live in New York .City where the Convention
wrts held.

In its platform. the SOCIALIST LABOR
PARTY of New York declared that recent
public developments havcexposcd the corrup-
tion of our political insititutions and the
Iragility of our most basic rights as citizens.

the Convention saw an encouraging sign in
“It: resulting loss of faith on the part of the
American working class in Capitulism‘s
political). .stt'ttcturci

' It urged the working class to go
further-to recognize that reforms can‘t make
the system work. and to replace capitalism
with a Socialist Industrial Republic.

Ihe SOCIALIS'I' LABOR I’AR'I‘Y denied
that there are strictly local issues in this cam-
paign. It declared that all social ills have their
basis iii a system based on the exploitation of
the working class by the capitalist class.

Warning that a vote for any of the
politicians is a wasted vote. it urged the
workers of N.Y. Slatho send a powerful
message of hope throughout the nation by
voting for the candidates of the SOCIALIST
LABOR PARTY . and for Socialism.

My vote for Emanuel and Massi in
November will NOT be wasted.

for Collegiate Association for the Research of

operating on many. different levels in many
parts of the globe. ltspurpose is multi-faceted
and its activities are very stimulating. One of
its prime goals is the uplifting of the present

this is an organization oftremendous value
and potential and all of you are encouraged to

Who Gets The Fee?

To the Editor: I 1
Question: 'What is the University Fee‘.’
Answer: - Bursur's Office - “the ‘Stop‘whieh
has been placed on your permanent record
(including registration) in the Registrar's 0f-
lice will he removed when payment has been
received and processed by our office." 

Adniinistration-Management and Plan-
ning Office: the Uitivcrsitydoes not assess the
fee. It is our responsibility to collect it. It is ad-
vised that you pay it. and then seek redress of
your grievance. Speak with someone in the
Chancellor's office about it.

Office of Administrative Services. State
University of New York: "that since the ques-
tion of the college fee has been raised by
various student organirations. Chancellor
Boyer litis asked his staff to review the entire
matter of the college l'ee."

This is not a scenario. but something that
actually happened to me about |"/z'years ago
upon leaving and then re-cntering the univer-
sity. Until then. I dutifully paid the fee
without question. Then I began speaking with
different officials to learn about the fee. I‘m
still not sure. and neither are the students
whom I've asked. “It! term university fee
seems very nebulous. ttlntl Lwould like to
know how the money is spent.

I hope that there iliil response tothis letter.
