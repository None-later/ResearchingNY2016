Would you give your support to the

answer. please read the following
narrative ol the events that led totlic
seven charges brought against him.

Alton Smith is n lllnck senior at
the State University ol New York at
Albany. (in November first. |‘)73.at
abottt ten p.m.. Mr. Smith was start-
dirtg on a street in Albany. As he was
about to enter his parked car.
another car sped tip nttd stopped.
llic two white men iii the cnrjumpcd
otit arid shouted. “llcy. trigger.“ at
Mr. Smitthcn they grabbed him
and started to d rag ltitn toward their.
car. all the while continuing their
rrbusivc language. As the two men
dragged nttd shoved Mr. Smith
toward their car. he shouted IrIr help.
He yelled lor the police. At that
point. one ol the inert said sar-
castically that they were cops. llut nt
Ito tittte. either hclorc orduringthcir
attack. did the men who indeed
were policemen identify
themselves with their badges. or any
ollicinl document. lhcy were dress-
cd in civilian elotltcs ol' denim:
neither looked ollieittl or especially
respectable: nttd their car was also
unmarked. lJtIprovokcd. they ltnd nt-
tacked ao itmoccnt man on the street
at ttigltt. lhere was certainly no
reason loer. Smith to believe. in
tire absence ol ttllicinl identiﬁcation.
that they were policctnett. lly the
trotc they had orally itlcntilied
themselves. tltcy had assaulted and
provoked grcat lcar in Mr. Smitlt.
lhcy gave thc itnprcssiort ol being
strcct tlittgs ottt on n lnrk to get a

his assailants. His hope was to make
a noise.

Soon Mr. ’ Smith‘s attackers
regained their gun. and then it un-
iformed policeman did appear. only

. to kick Mr. Smith's head. causing it

large wound. 'l'hen wounded and
exhausted and totally abused ~
Mr. Smith was put into a police van
ittid taken to the police stat ion. And
it was only after he had been hand-
cul'l'ed to a cliitirtind interrogated for
a while that Mr. Smith's assailants
identified themselves. with ofﬁcial
identification. as police. Mr. Smith
was their jailed for the night without
any medical care for his wounds. In
his cell the next morning. Mr. Smith.
still with pain. was again ltnndcuffcd
and then kicked iii the groin. and
told ttot to cnttsc any trouble.

littt Mr. Smith is not atid was
never a trottblc-r‘nnker. llis bail was
set at twenty-thousand dollars.
despite the fact that he has ticvcr
received even a trnll'ic ticket. lie is a
college student hoping to graduate in
.luoc. Mr. Smith is not a trouble-
tnakcr. bttt now he isirI trotiblc. lie is
in trouble tor reacting as anybody
would to street violence and brutali-
ty. Mr. Smith needs your support.
He is free on bail: his trial is coming
up in the near lutttrc.

Ilint night. when Alton Smith
tired his nttrrckcr's gun itt a desperate
attempt to get help. a bystander was
sttpcrltctttlly wounded. littt that

bystander is not even pressing
charges against Mr. Smith. because
it is clear that M r. Smith was not try-
ing to shoot anybody. Mr. Smiih
was trying to save his life by cnllittg
for the police. while. ironically. the
police were beating him tip. And or
course the charges against him are
also ironic. for it was /It' who was be-
ing assaulted.

tCI’S)~-~'l'wo groupsjfriendly to
the concept ol‘open admissions—the
idea that every highsehool‘graduatc
should be guaranteed admission to a
higher education institution
regardless of grades or finances-
have issued reports critical ol'current
open admissions programs.

Sharply contradicting claims of
"success" for the City University of
New York‘s (CUNY) program. the
school‘s faculty union charged
t'llNY with failing to give open ad-
missions students “ti reasonable op-
portunity for collegiate success“ and
the CUNY administration with mis-
management and misinl'orming the
public to conceal that fact.

the Professional Staff Congress
tl’HgI. the faculty union. said thcad-
ministration has allowed "myths"
nhottl open admissions to continue.
the roost dangerous of which is that
"open admissions is being udcquntc-
ly managed arid ndcqitntcly ltrndcd
by the (‘ity and State."

education “as currently organized“
mirrors the “highly stratified“
orgnniyntion of our society and
perpetuates the status divisions

“If dropping out is not necessarily
failure.” the report said. “retention is
not neeessrtrily success."

Stressing that its criticism of the
('lINY program was not an attack
on open admissions per  the l’SC
called for an investigation by the

knowledge that the Board “shares

American Drivers Ignore ‘
55 -MPH Speed Limit

Americans generally are ignoring
the nationwide 55 mile-an-hour
speed liiriit imposed to save gasoline.
but they are driving more slowly
than they did before the energy
crisis. nit Associated Press stirvey
shows.

Ilic Al' sent reporters in the 48
contiguous states to drive on the
htghvvnys on May I. keeping at a
steady 55 ni.p.h. pace. in all but a
handful of states. drivers whirled by
cars traveling at_the legal limit.

Authorities say the number of
speeding tickets is tip. 'l'roopers in
Oregon and l‘exas say they‘ve make

tttote than twice as many arrests tor
spccding this spring than they did
last year.

Accidents and traffic deaths are
down. lhc National Sufctycotincil
says trul'lic dcnths this March were

25 per cent lower. Some states
reported that the fatality rate had
been ctit iii half.

lhe average speed of cars in most
areas covered by the AI’ survey was
between (t5 atid 70 mph. above the '
legal limit. but below the rate
motorists used to travel when the
legal limit was 70 mph.

Under legislation passed by Con-
gress late last year. the states were
given tttitil Mnrcltto lower the speed
limit to 55 mph. All 50 states coni-
plied.

An Al’ road check iii January
showed that motorists in states
vv'hIclI lowered their speed limit
belore the deadline were obeying the
lnvv. driving at about 55 m.p.h.

llic latest survey indicates.
however. tltnt tltc growingavailabili-
ty ol fuel has riindc motorists careless
about conservation. '
