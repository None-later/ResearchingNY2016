Moore‘s livelier songs are reminis-
cent of the McCartney and Emitt
Rhodes school of music—both
vocally and in their knack. for the
light and catchy phrases. Moore.
however. carefully avoids the vocal
excesses that McCartney has been
attracted to as of late.

The 25 year-old singer is certainly
aware of his influences and he seems
to pull most from the spirit of mid-
sixtics rock and roll (it stillhada ru/l
then). The only problem here is that
Moore wants to maintain certain
contemporary standards followed
by many of the popular album
artists most noticeably the three
minute-plus tiniingof songs. Most oi

mark. when taken bcyond this time.
the listener expects more than just'
good feeling Illmul‘. he expects

development and dynamic changes
within the confines of the song.

"Aviation Man“ is a so-so
downbeat number. appealing for its
2:4tt time more than anything else.
Had “When You Close Your Eyes“
been recorded with a similar time in
mind. it Would have been able to eti-
joy its hit-making ingredients.

which are especially pretty and cott-
tribute to the album‘s more beautiful
moments. Yet these momciitsarc not
really dctclopcd alter their In-
trodiictioti and the same problem of
static character once again arises.
While the music is nice. it is this pcr-
sistaiit need for dynamic develop-
ment that hurts the songs and tltc
album in general.
