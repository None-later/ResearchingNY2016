It‘s rare in college sports to
find an athlete participating in
three sports. Ilut Rudy Vidodoes
it and he does it well.

Coach liill Schicl'felin is a
tniraclc worker. He took a soccer
team that won only once the year
before and transformed them
into a NCAA tournament team.
It took a great deal of hard
recruiting to revamp the team.
but Schicl'telin pulled it off. He
ptit togctltcr a solid team coin—

coaching was outstanding in
handling these young
ballplaycrs. His team should be
even better next year.

.iim Shrader of the cross-

American honors. and Coach
llob Munsey. whose track team
had other undefeated seasons,
finished second in the voting.

thsey feels that Cleary will be
reaching anywhere from 2.10 to 240
leet next year. “He is both a strong
perlornter and a clutch performer.
My track men would have rolled
over and died today under such
pressure."

Munsey then joked. "as a matter
of fact. they didn‘t need pressure to
roll tour today. lhey just heard the
gun go off and tainted."

Although disappointed with the
do)": showing. Munsey felt that the
learn had enjoyed an otherwise solid
season. He pointed at the 73-72dual
