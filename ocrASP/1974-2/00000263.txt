the housing proposal considered
by tltc Common Council of Albany
was tabled at the last meeting.

The proposal. sitnilar to tlte otte

ttllows two unmarried people to

Although this measure is sitttilar
to laws already on tlte city books. it
wottld give the-Bureau of('ode lin—
lorcetttettt tlte power to lttkcttction
against the nonrelttted families.

According to ()Il-(‘ttmptts
llottsing Director .loscplt A. Scur-
ittg. cttlot‘cetttettt ol' the lttw would
not he stringent. He sees it as a
means to evict students when
neighbors complain of excessive
noise. crowded parking and otltcr
"nuisances."

Six years ago. itt May ol"ottl. the
city‘s definition of it family was one
or more people occupying a single
dwelling and operating a sittgle
housekeeping ttuit.

llten in ‘69 that definition was
changed to one or tnore people oc-
cttpyiug a single dwelling ttnit and

retttcd apartments to several

landlords won. at least temporari-
ly, when l‘L‘tlUl'lll Court Judge
James |. l'oley declared the por-
lton ol theslattttechttllenged hy the
landlords was ttnconstitutional.

Itttt. when the Albany proposal
reucltcd the floor ol the Common
Council meeting .lttne .lt'd. no one
knew wltctltcr the Supreme Court
ruling legally Invalidttted the ‘72

Judge l-‘olev‘s decision. making the
'o‘) lutv (the stricter one) the dcl'tni-
tiott. The proposal was tabled.

SA President Pat Cttrran and
Veep Ira Bintbaum spoke with
Albany Mayor Erastus Corning
about the city proposal. Corning
supported tltc bill because ol'thc
alleged crowded parking. the noise
problems. the density of popula-
tiott. and the in'tbility of middlein-
cottte lam ilies to .Cttltlpclc

groups ol students who generally
pay higher rents tor the same space.

At the .lttnc er Common Coun-

to the bill was organized by the

lucted the city block associations.
landlords. and other interested
groups.

Lenny I‘erlmuttcr. publisher of
the Spirit suggested a compromise
measure .lttne 5. but the meeting
did not prodttce any agreement ex-
cept an assurance that any legislu~

exempt people cttrrcntly holding

MONDAY, JUNE 17,- 1974

 

 

 

‘ by David Lerner

As: President Louis T. Beneut
enters: the. lord months of his live

year Administration. he may ﬁnd
. himself faced with a new scmcstcr

once itgain without a Dean of the

1 College of Arts and Sciences. and

now without a Dean for the Divi-
sion of Behavioral ttnd Social
Sciences. By next .lttly. we will no

’ longer have a. President as well.

It’s your life.

Search Committees to recom-
tttend candidates to fill the two
Deanships have been underway
since ettrly last semester. They had
tiled their reports towards the end
of the academic year but the Un-
iversity has yet to act on those
recotttmendations.

the man closest to assuming it
new post is Richard Kendall. now
the Acting Dean for the Behavioral
Sciences division ttnd seeking that
post permanently. As of this date.
the SUNY Board of 'l'rustccs has
not approved it Kendall appoint-
tttcttt. for the simple reason that
they have not met since Academic
Vice-President Philip Sirotkin sent
in his recommendation to the
lloard in April.

Kendall held that post duringthe
year while the Search Committee
supposedly looked for a permanent
replacemettt. the Committee linttl-
ly released a “no recommendation"
to A 'ademie Vice—President Philip
Sirotkin Ittte itt March which
cleared the way for Sirotkin to
recommend Kendall‘s permanent
appointment to that post. The
Sirotkin announcement came as a
surprise to no one. In fact. many
disgruntled faculty and students
claimed that the entire Search
Committee process was rigged hy
Sirotkin from its inception. to
allow hint to make his own up-
pointmettt. l'ltc “no—
reeotntncndation" decision of-
Iicially climimttcd arty obstacles in
Sirotkin‘s path if in fact that was
his motive. lo be so rc. reports were
issued from his office vehemently
denying any such accusations.

.lttstine Davidson. Siroktin‘s
secretary. argued that the Vice-
Presldcnt had no foreknowledge
whatsoever of tlte Search Corn-
mittec's deliberations. and that he
never exercised any pressure on
any of the Committee members to
follow his lead.

Kendall was the subject of in-
tense controversy last year. as

creditors argued that emit dwell
respected Chairman" of the History ,
Department. :a position he held '
before assuming thc'duties ol' the
Acting Dean. ‘

l~lis detractors claimed that he

V ltttd no Qualifications in the field of

academia with which to run a Dlvi- 

sion. They claimed that without cx- '

rather than ttdministrtttiyc ends of
ed tteat ion. he could not’poss'gbly be
qualified to sit in judgment on.
teachers who havc'heen denied
tenure for one reason or another
when they come before him for
review. They feel his appointment
is simply a device by President
chexct to put a hatchet man in the
Dean position before he resigns
next .Iuly. .
The faculty has an extremely
sore nerve opening on the subject
of tenure review. They painfully
recall the days of H unshcrgcr when
tiles of teachers were allegedly
tampered with. false letters of
transmittal were sent. and pressure
pttt on key people to eliminate
l'ttettlty that didn't conl'ortildll‘ihe
