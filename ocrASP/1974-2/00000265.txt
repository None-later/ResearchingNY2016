 Or Maybe Never-

While the House Judiciary Committee considers the fate of the beleaguered
 Presidency. the greatest obstruction ofjustice continues to go unpunished in this na-
Ction. Richard Nixon is still the President ofthe United States. and the stalling and
‘ :delays of the “stonewall defense“ (a strategy more apt for the football ﬁeld than the
,7 residency) will continue to weaken the Presidency far more than the release ofall
subpoenaed evidence.

Nixon is playing games with this country. still hoping to preserve his untenable
osition in the courts of public relations. Two years after the break-in. we are still
hearing the sorry excuses of “national/security.“ executive privilege. and “preser-
ving the office of the Presidency.“

H There are no signs that the Judiciary Committee will vote for impeachment
1‘ before the end of the summer. For all their tough talk and strong letters. the Cott-
gressmen are clearly in no hurry to commit themselves to eliminating the cancerous

j parasite that has occupied the office of the President. Even with their warnings that-

the stonewalling tactics “may be grounds for impeachment itself." in their very

-' deliberatcncss. they are. in effect. begging the President to “be a good guy.“ resign
.Jland get them off the hook. Apparently the committeemen do not relish the
. burden of history that has been thrust on their shoulders.

V The Committee needs a shot in the arm i'n.thc form of a continuous barrage of
' public opinion and pressure. Without such a reminder. it is quite possible that the

Committee may join the majority of Republicans in the hope that the entire mess
withjust‘gp away. buried in the subconscious residue of yesterday‘s news.

_ The Committee still responds to the inspiration of letters from ltoitte. Perhaps
public pressure still carries its rightful weigltt on Capitol Hill. Nixon knows that if
;_ nothing dramatic develops to prod the Committee. the public. too. will be unable to
maintain its activism. But Nixon has been wrong before. far more often than most
of us would like to remember. and he may be wrong about the coinplaccitcy of the

American people. It took the students to unseat Lyndon Johnson; it will take the

students to unseat Richard Nixon."

When do you start to exist? By that. ldoit‘t
mean the regular heart-beating. sleep-and-eat
existence; I mean the you-are-your-own-
person. independent-decision-maltln‘ ex-
istence. All start. out as children. and eventual~
ly “grow up" and “take care of“ themselves.
Generally. the longer a child lives with his
parents the longer it takes to become indepen-
dent. l’arents are for making all kinds of
decisions. from what food to eat. to what
college to tittend. Not living with one‘s parents
forces the child to decide exactly what to do
with his/her tintc.

Living at college is an interesting com-
promise as far as seeing how a person‘s affairs
are resolved. The school will feed you (though
you have a choice of times and a veto on the
meal altogether). take charge of you when ill
or injured. ntake a few higltly reasonable and
very minor restrictions on your home life. and
occasionally ban you from the campus com-
pletely. You can decide for yourself when (or
whether) to do laundry. when and which
courses to take. and generally what to do all of
lltc time. For many it is a major change. and
adjustment is difficult. For others. who have
been more independent all along. it isn‘t.
Some go to college as they go to high school;
as commuters. living at home. They become
more independent Without a major change in
their cnvironntent. and still use their family as

thirsty ‘

Many get involved in other parts of the en-

its own newspaper and radio station. its own

Association) which operated relatively free

It is said that the purpose of theUniversity is
to’separate people from the realgworld. take
care of most of their needs and let them spend
their time studying life. reﬂecting on .tnanltiod
in general. learning" assorted skills and
memoriiing assorted facts. Arid college in
fact. does do this. It becomes a halfway house
from dependence to independence with the
added attraction of some real education in the '
process. ‘lihe University is seen by too many as
only a step in an arbitrary ladder of success.
but that is only part of it. While good grades
are often important to one‘s future. their
significance should not obscure the oppor-
tunity that college offers. It could be a last
chance to dabble. to think. to be doing in-
teresting things without too much respon-
sibility. It may bethe last time to find out what
you really want. By the same token. it could
also interfere with finding what you.really
want.

Independence is a desirable quality in our
society. and is actively encouraged. The Un-
ited States system of education guides each in-
dividual in incremental steps leading to the full
realization of each person's potential. Sup-

     

     

  
   
 

 
 
  
  
 

  

  

  
  
  

 
 
 

   
   
   
  

Our stay here can be viewed as primarily an
educational experience energized by an at-
mosphere of people and activity. In a sense.
there'is nothing more here than other people
to meet. new friends to make. and a whole
gamut of activities to do with them. Smiles.
honesty. laughter and goodness abound. It is
seriousness in a sea of recreation.
