the smite in tlte elapsing l9 months.

Morality is at the heart of the
issue ‘for proponents of total
amnesty. l'here are well over a
hundred thousand individuals
"who lntve already suffered a great
deal for their conscientiously held
tttoral convictions. and it is time to
call a [tail to that suffering." said
Robert llrown. Professor of
religion at Stanford. ’ As does
t'lat‘k. llrown ttrges that those with
the power to grattl antttcsty "begin
to bind up the nation‘s Wounds in—
stead of continuing to rtth still on
them."

lirown argues. Not only weretltese

crime scents to be that they were

We tttust “forget that some peo-

pm ' a varietyol emotions.
So'me’ praised. the , University and
epok'c of  unique time in their lives;
othcre'crittcized the “fountain of
learning“. saying they were glad to
be leaving the place «they‘d called
home for four years.

 One disgusted male student said

he was glad to leave Albany State

‘ because. “It‘s not the place for me

anymore." He added that he was
sorry to leave all his friends but was
not. sorry to leave the institution.
Ily way of contrast. a female stu-
dent characterized her stay at
Albany State as the “best four years”

.and “the end ofun era.“ Not only did

she feel academic accomplishments-
shc also felt she would never again
have the some experiences or
feelings.

Most students shared feelings of
relief. fear. cxeitcment. and sadness.
Some students expressed absolute
terror ill the thought of going to
work alter graduation because they
would meet a whole new breed of
people. They felt that they would

'meet people more like themselves in

graduate school..

Although many resident students
regretted leaving SU NYA because it
had become a “home”. some noted
that itt life there must be progression
and no one should allow himself to
get into a rut.

While most resident students will
miss their friends. commuter
students may not feel such deep loss.

going to graduate school. Most
students. hoWever. were not par—

One commuter student felt he had
lived a “sheltered life“ (at home with
his parents) and was anxious to get
ottt in the world and get a job. Alter
working a few years. he would think
ahottt graduate school.

When asked if he were anxious to
go to work after graduation. one
blonde-haired boy grinned broadly
attd replied. “I have to work the rest
of nty life so I might as well postpone
it as lottg as possible.“ This remark
probably sums up many students‘
leelings pretty aptly.

Generally. people agreed that the
school was outstanding academical-
ly. However. the general consensus
w ' that the school's size worked to

its detriment. although certain ad- '

vantages to being large were noted.
