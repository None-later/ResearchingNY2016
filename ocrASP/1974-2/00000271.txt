Ilu'nbanin and (Jentral (Iouneil Chairperson Dave

which would base limits or peopl on what the size of
the dwelling units; could reasonably lioltl. Dave and
Ira presented their plan to Mayor Corningand Coin-
inon (Jouneil I'resident Connors; at a city hall
meeting. At. the ensuing Common Council meeting.
Coyne criticized the tactic ol‘discriminating between
related and unrelated people and Iliriibalun proposed
their plan. Action on the issue. which had been ex—
pected prior to the start ol the school so that the city
wouldn't. have to worry about angry hordes or
students. was ' ain ptit oil.

The issue is still notdoad.Anotheramendment has
been introduced. which would require unrelated peo-
ple living in numbers greater than liord to apply l'oi'it
permit from the city. Since the (criteria l'ori suing
Stitle a permit have not yet been divulged. it is dil'»
lieult to asses the merits ol such a plan. In the mean-
time. the SA leaders have been attempting to contact.
Common Council members. on an individual basis to
more thoroughly discuaa their position on the issue.
