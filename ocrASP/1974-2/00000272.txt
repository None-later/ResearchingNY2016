tiott of a large sanctuary of

the primarily American expedi-

tent of the ancient city walls is in the
process of being uncovered.

said. “It would have been a lot worse
if it [the coup] had waited two days

Kendall Appointed Dean Of
Behavioral, Social Sciences

by David Lerner

Surprising no one. the'l'ureer
'I’ri/mm' reported in its August 26th
issue that former Acting Dean ofthe
Division of Behavioral and Social
Sciences RichardKendallhad finally
been approved to that post on a per-
manent basis.

The announcement of his up-
proval came from Chancellor

Iioyer‘s office iii a note of con-
gratulations to the Dean. issued
sometime during August.

Rumors had been circulating that
the appointmentlwouid come in the
summer. though Kcndall‘ was
nominated by Vice-President Philip
Sirotkin and supported by President
Louis Ilenech as early as March 2|.
'lhe speculation was that an. ap-
pointment over the summer could
not generate arty immediate feed-
back. tltouglt most admit that Ken-
dall‘s approval was simply a matter
of fortn.

Russell (iugino. ol'thc Liaison 0_f-
lice working out of the Chancellor's
office reported that inflict there was
no record of Kendall's approval.
(iugino based this statement on the
fact that the SU NY Board of
lt'ustces. the body it was thought
had to give its approval to any im-
portant appointed post. had never
approved the former History
Department Chairman durittg any
of its summer sessions.

(iugitto went on to say that any
reports of Kendall‘s appointment
were "speculation" “ldon‘t. know
how anyone got that information.
but certainly the Board tol'i‘rustccs)

never approved him 'over the
summer.“

The discrepancy appears to be
centered over the jurisdiction ofthe
two offices. ngino explained that
the Board must approve any up-
pointment which carries a salary of
over $20.000.which. he said. “your
boy (Kendall)certainly qualifies un-
tier.“

Justine Davidson. secretary to
Vice President Sirotkin said that
may be so. but the cutoff salary
Iigure is much higher.

in arty event. apparently. the

Chancellor was able to takejuritdic-
tion in the case and issued Kendall
his-approval..

The Administration is still
somewhat less than settled at this
point. as the position for- Arts and
Sciences Dean is vacant with no
thought to a possible replacement.

complish something during the past

lists a series of dates from June ill.

plain. itt chronological order. the
events that led to the theft: how the
combination lock ltud been changed
only a week before the 'breuk—in:
how : he first noticed scratches on
the inner door to the equipment
rootn. 'l'ne Moon Lee goes on
relating how one night a member of
Photo Service picked up the ringing
phone only to have the other party
hang-up. obviously checking if the
oilicc was vacant.

‘ “On June 27 at 6:30at night lcame
back from my job at the library. I
was Worried because of the scratches
on the lock from the day before. The
two innerdoors were locked. No one

checked the cabinctwherc the equip-
mettt is kept under lock. “1 was
shocked. I did not know how to
react." The cabinet had been emp-
tied of a series of Nikon bodies and
lenses. Only a few pieces were left
behind. They were used and looked
old. The Nikons were new.

someone who tried to break in locks

key and simply walk into the room
where the equipment was stored.
They are aware that there are
numberous unauthorized master

also aware that whoeverdid break in

I he case is bcittg cottductcd by In—

papers on his desk reminding him of
yet ineompleted investigations. The
Photo Service case is one of many.

attetttpt to discover tlte perpetrator
ol the crime. Roth coir only sayilhltl

What was investigator Ruth do-

use of the Psychological Stress
livaluator. a machine that measures
stress in the voice of the questioned.
Was the machine going to be used on
university staff members who had
access to the room‘.’ “No. at the pre-
sent we will ask only three students".
Ruth answered. Ruth described it as
a way of eliminating three
possibilities. However be outlined
no specific times for such a test. and
'while claiming to have tried to reach
all tltree students. to date only one
was reached.

The folks in the backroom of the
third floor are not very hopeful of
recovering their losses. Was the
equipment insurcd‘.’ “No. says
Mark. "we lost something a couple
of years back. ’lhe insurance com-
pany dropped us. Tltcy won't insure
us cause too many people have
access to the equipment." - Dave- in-

would get 20 per cent of the value

annually for coverage against theft.
We couldn't pay that."
