Arthur Malkin also said, “These '

profiles do not make any attempt to
make any value judgements about
the state legislators. Their main pur-
pose is to provide the citizensof New
York State the information to make
intelligent voting decisions in
November.“fl'he objectivity of this
study is in contrast to the only other
existing compilation of data on the
New York State Legislature which is
found in the New York State Red
Boo/r. 'l'hc objectivity of the Red
Book is subject to question because
it is written by the legislators
thernselved or by members of their
staffs.

The project was conceived by the
NYI’IRG State Board last summer
and was begun in December of I973.
Over '200'volunteers worked on it,

mostly college students but also in-
cluding ‘Wall Street lawyers and
housewives . The effort cost $30M”.
