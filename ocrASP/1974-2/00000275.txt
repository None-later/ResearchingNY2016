On Sunday night the annual
Business meeting of the STATE
Chess Association was conducted.
At the meeting. Ed Edmondson
related the present status of Bobby
Fischer. Fischer had mtidc several
demands on the procedure for con-
ducting the World Championship
tournament. but his demands were
rejected by the World Chess Federii~
tion (FIDE). This resulted in
Fischer's refusing to play in the
World Championship which is
scheduled for next year. The current
situation is still bleak, and the
chances of Fischer playing in the
championship are slim. Should
Fischer forfeit the championship.

that the former president would be
able to prove it is a truth that
politicians are corrupt and therefore
he was only acting in the realm of
truth. I didn‘t understand howthis
or anything else would actually have
kept him in office. lguess Dr. Kohn
didn‘t think that Nixon would un-

sent the letter.
