 1 Why we’re Different *

 

l _ A Message To Freshmen 8: New Students

Welcome to Albany, the land of sunshine
and green meadows! (If you find them.
please stop in and let us know where they
are we’ve been looking for them.)

We are the only store in the area that is
owned & run by music lovers. We have the
kind of music that you are looking for.

You will notice over the Coming year
that our advertised specials are far more

‘ exciting than our competitors’. That is

because what they advertise is no better
than the many, many unadvertised
specials going on every day at Just A
Song. If you stick with us you’ll enlarge
your record collection for less than
anywhere else in this area. Come see us.

Below we are listing the six reasons why
we think you should at least stop in and
check out our store before you buy another
record.

1) OUR EVERYDAY PRICES

Check for yourself. Visit all the record
shops in town. Nobody’s everyday prices
are lower than ours.

OUTS

overstocks you have ever seen anywhere.

& you don’t have to look through a moun-
tain of junk before you find something
good. What you see on the opposite page is
just a small sampling of what we offer.
ALL QUALITY STUFF.
