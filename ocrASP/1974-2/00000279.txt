: Invthisftbe ﬁrst chess column of
Q the semester. I would like to an-
notlnee some of the upcoming chess
events as well as the various places
yvhere students can play chess
"regularly during the semester. ‘l'his
maybe hard to believe. but the
Albany itrea is quite rich in chess ac-,
tivity in the form of tournaments
(mostly ll.S. Chess Federation rated
tournaments). clubs which meet
regularly and frequently. and
possibly a ‘chess league which
spoiisers matches between various
clubs.

Hrst ol‘all. lot the cotitpctilivc lot
among us . there are the tour-
naments. MajorS round tornaincnts
are held approximately once a
month. and minor qtuidriinglcs are
held roughly eyery week-end. l-oi‘
people who are new at competitive
chess: _Aniiijor tournament lasts one
complete week-end (All day Satur-
day. most ol‘ Sunday) where .is u
initior tournament usually lasts only
one complete day (usually Satiri-
day). Most tournaments are “.5.
t‘liess lr'edcration rated. which
means that each participant iiitist be

tion. the annual dues t'or such
memberships is currently Slit or SS

l'ormatioii about these clubs will be
ayailable at the SUNYA Chess Club.

A chess league was started about
two years ago. the SUNY/y Chess

Club did not participate last Spring ‘

because not enough students were
willing to play matches. However. it
there are students who would like to
play in a chess league. they should
come to the SUNYA Chess Club.

One more word about the
SUNYA Chess Club is important.
the club has a certain amount of
money which is used primarily to
pay Ior expenses inyoly‘ing tour-
naments and matches. One major
