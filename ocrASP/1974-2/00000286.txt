Graduation Leaves
Batmen With Large Gap

by Ed Heliter .
The Albany State baseball

team's prospects for the coming. .

season are still cloudy. Due to
bad weather and cold days
Coach Burlingame hasn’t been
able to look overthe up and com-
ing prospects on the team.

“Only two of last years starters
are returning and have their
positions pretty much locked up
while the rest is still up in the air."
stated Coach Burlingame. The
two returnees. who will be cx~
pcctcd to lead the squad. are ro-
captains Vic Guilianelli and Jeff
Breglio.

The greatest gap was left in the
pitching staff with the gradua-
tion of All Conference Devin
Quinn who compiled a 7-!
record last year. The hitting has
been depicted by the graduation
of Terry Kenny who set a school
record by batting .453 last
season.

Oneonta will still betough this
coming season. as they won the
Conference Championship last
season andlost very few players
for this upcoming season. Coach
Burlingamc expects to takeevcry
game as it comes and not to

worry too far in the future. This
weekend the Great Danes have a
doubleheader with Utica. where
mtrch experimentation is ex-
pected. They should have a
regular starting team ready for
the first conference game.
scheduled for September I4.
with a home doubleheader ver-
sus Potsdam.

ll‘ past performances are, any
indication of future endeavors.
the Great Danes should be able
to bring home the Conference

Championship as they did in the’

72-73 season with a |0-2 record
that season. '
