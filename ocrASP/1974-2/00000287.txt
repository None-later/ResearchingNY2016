With the growingawai'cncssol'tlie
American Woman plus recent rulings
by the Department of Health.
Education and Welfare. women‘s

‘collegitttc sports have skyrocketed.

across the college campus.
» Here at Albany things are no
dil'lereiit. the Women‘s 5pm“
Department budget has been in-
creased to provide better quality
competition on the varsity level. -
in past years. the budget has been
adequate for the needs of Womens‘
Sports. the increase in this year's
budget will allow for tougher
scheduling and larger tcain rosters.

l'he problem iti Women's- Sports
has been ol~ team strength. 'I his year
the teams hope to expand to allow
for increased participation. Leona
ltheitisli ol' the Physical Education
Department feels that Albany has the
resources for a successful women‘s
program. She described the situation
by sitying.‘|’liere‘s a lot at" tulenton

r this campus biit they'tiren‘t 'coming
ottt and participating."

Unlike' ,Mens‘ sports. the women
do not offer scholarships to recruit
for therarious teams. Matty ol‘ the

. women who come to the program
are inexperienced; “WWW” the
coaching must start with basics in
order to prepare for intercollegiate

'contpetition. Ms. Ithenisli praised
the stall lor their line work in past
hL‘lIb‘llllS. .

l his year. the I rack Club has es-
paiided to become a \arsity sport.
llie interest it.‘\Ci in other clubs is in-
ei' ising which may eventually lead
to \‘ars'ity programs.

At SUNYA the emphasis is on
education. Most coaches. men arid
women. leel that academics is at a
higher priority than athletics. The
students‘ interest in athletics s- more
than just coinpetitit'e spirit. l'lie en-
joyment aspect ot sports is stressed
as a lorm ol' recreation. the
emphasis ol‘ sports in higher educa-
tioii institutions is being changed by
society. Women‘s sport is trying to
keep up with the desires ol SUNYA
students.

will allow tor expanded scheduling
and larger learns l'or “’“mCH'S

combat rising prices in eqtiipitient
arid services. SA Controller Jerry
Alhreclit commented on the l'initu-

‘cial, picture iii general with ilie
l'olluwing statement. “We have two'
objectives that we are tryingto meet.
First. to avoid increasing budgets
when possible because our income is
lised. Second. to respond to a de-
mand for a better Womens
collegiate athletic program.“
