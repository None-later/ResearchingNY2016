brc‘viated prison sentences for‘thier part inlthe break-in ol" theDemocratic National
Committee office and the subsequent cover-up of their activates.

President Ford has set anueg precedent that 'will serve only to polarize this nation ‘
' into two groups: 'the lawless and super-legal super-rich, and the rest ol the people who

are bound by the laws of thc_Constitution. The President has proved that to have
money and inlluence in the United States is to be above the law of the common man.
To ti man who has broken every moral and probably every legal code applicable to
politicians and their‘behavior. Gerald Ford has promised Nixon that the law will never
touch him. Weare left with the haunting memory of H.R. Haldeman‘s comment to the
effect that yes. the President is. indeed. above the law.

I h -audacity of Ford's action is astounding! Other than the purely logical question
of thc'propriety of pardoning a man who has not yet been indicted, Ford is treading
critically close toward the misuse of his own power. L 's than three wecksago. Ford
ltad said that to pre-emptorily pardon the ex-l’resident would be both “unwise and llll-
timelr.“ We mu'st note that nothing of substance has happened since then that could
po 1ny have altered that point of view.

Not until all the’facts have been disclosed to the rcvoltcd American electorate
through the judicial proce. es. can the "wage wounds of Watergate begin to heal.
l‘iird‘. rresponsible act ol'pardo has madethistaskimpossible. Heis helping to feed
the llames ofdiscontent that Americans are demonstrating towards Wt hington.

lhe honeymoon is over. Mr. President. and separation proceedings may start
sooner than you expect.

Gimme Shelter.

Last lhursday night‘s decision by the Albany Common ‘ouneil to forbid more than
three unrelated persons from sharing an apartment. seriously threatens the status f
the thre thousand students who presently live off-campus. and the future of off-
campus living as an i stitution. Couched in euphemistic terms designed theoretically
to protect the delinition of“l'amily." the Council's decision was without a doubt design-
ed eil‘ically with the students in mind. '

It is truly unfortunate that supposedly mature and reasonable Council members
react in such an undistinguishing manner When pressure groups such a Neighborhood
Asso ions lobby to preserve their ‘elite" neighborhoods. This clearly dis-
ertini ttory legislation will hurt the downtown merchants w o depend upon the
business that the students bring for much of their income.

At a press conference held yesterday by SA President Pat Curran, SA lawyer Sandy
Rosenbloom proposed that all off-campus residents mark their money with a red pen
so that the local me ants can guage just how seriously y will be affected by the
sudden removal of the students.

On a more immediate level. the infusion ol'this additional threetho'usand residents
will mortally wound this campus. Since the campus is designed to hold only 5.400
residen iner ing that occupancy without increasing capacity will no doubtdestroy
this university. Logically enough. the A bany Common Council is entirely cavalier in
its attittide toward the fate of Albany State that isn't altogether in Albany. and whose
r . dents can‘t vote in the localelections.'l‘heir apathy is not unexpected. but theirlack
of human concern is appalling.

lliough Rosenbloom can comfort us by assuring that those students who have leases
a ile from the implementation ol'the new law. the fate of the Three ’I'bousand will be
in just as serious jeopardy by January. No student can take comfort in the un-
conscionable act of the Council. and we urge the Mayor to reject the Council‘s
proposal and demonstrate his concern for all of his cttizens.

Nixon: Justice Denied

In the period immediately lollowing
Richard Nixon‘s resignation of the Presiden-
cy. popular sentiment suggested that he be
spared the ordeal of a trial on the criminal
charges that led to his lossol'a political has n
the Congr Supporters ol'thi course ol'in—
action reasoned that Nixon‘s tall from powur
and his uii' sal disgrace served as sufficient
punishment for hi alleged misdeeds.

ore recent much popular support had
b n \‘press d for the view that the former
l’re. dent should receive [C than total im-
munity lroni the law‘s requirements-Some ad-
voeat ' of this view favored a sort of plea
bargaining: Nixon would be offered immunity
front prose ition in e change for an admis-
sion ol guilt concerning the Watergate cover-
up. Others felt that the special prosecutor
should have been allowed to pursue a convic-
tion: however. if a conviction had been ob-
tained. the former President's sentence should
have been suspended. At his p 'eonl'crence‘
ol August 2H. President Ford stated that the
spec il prosecutor had an "obligation" to take
' on against “any a lid all individuals" that he
saw lit to prosecute.

He did indie though. that had Nixon‘s
guilt be establi. ted in court, a Presidential
pardon would have been forthcoming to
relieve hint of his semen Sunday. in a sur-
prise move. President Ford granted Nixon tl
complete and tiitconditional pardon concer-
iiitig any crimes Nixon may have committed
during his tenure as President.

“Mr. Ford erred when he decided to pardon
Nixon. It appeared that Nixon was guilty of
breaking United States law while serving its

forcement of!" r‘ . It appeared that he had
been guilty ol violating his Constitutional
