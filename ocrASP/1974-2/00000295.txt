It is now much too late to debate the
issue: marijuana versus no marijuana.
Marijuana is here to stay. No conceivable
law-cnt'orccment program can curb its
availability. Accordingly. we offer these
seven recomnicudatiotis.

(I) Consumers Union recommends the
immediate repeal of all federal laws
governing the growing. processing.
transportation. sale. possession. and use
of marijuana.

(2) ('onsumcrs linion recommends
that each of the fifty states similarly
repeal its existing marijuana laws aiitl
puss new laws lcgaliliiig the cultivation.
processing. aiitl orderly marketing of
marijuana subject to appropriate
regulations. ..

Most discussions of legalizing mari-

juana anticipate that distribution will he

turned o\cr to the tobacco companies. or
the alcoholic-bcwragc companies. or to
similar large commercial enterprises. We
urge instead that illtll\ idtlal states experi-
