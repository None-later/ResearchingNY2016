This is not fiction. It happened here this
ast summer. The girl was taken to the
ospital for an examination and the Un-
vcrsity Police wrote out their report. The
ncident is still under investigation by the

lbanyJ’olice. ‘

Although the number of reported rapes
n this campus is not high. the number of
ckualassault cases is. The Director of
‘ecurity. James Williams and several
members of the University Police have
iscussed recently the different aspects of
the sexual abusecases: victims. suspects.
circumstances and possible preventive
measures that could be taken. There have
been seven reported cases of sexual abuse
already this year. as opposed to only one
reported inthc sa me period in I973. From
the standpoint of the University Police.
seven is seven too many. Officers Denise
Patton and Mary Daley stressed the fact
that these assaults have to be reported in
order far them to be stopped. They also
pointed out that reporting these cases
does not necessarily mean getting legally
involved. It will help to get the suspect
ol'l'thc street. James Williams said that'hc
felt one of the reasons more assaults have
been reported recently is dttc to the addi-
tion of female officers to the University
Police. There are two female officers
presently on the force. He also said that as
in any community. there are one to four
times more assaults than reported.

Although any one individual case may
not turn up enough evidence to make
positive identification of a suspect possi-
ble. the probability is great that this is not
the first time. This past summer. a suspect
was finally apprehended after 3 victims
individually reported their abuse cases to
the University Police. Individually they
could not have made an arrest. but with
three victims. positive identification was
possible.

The details of the assaults vary. but the
pattern is recurring: A female alone in a
remote part of the campus There are ex-
ceptions. For example. one girl this
summer was grabbed on the podium at
|:()() in the afternoon. The others all in-
volved seclusion. A girl sleeping with her
door unlocked at 3 A.M.asa guy crawled
into bed with her; anolhcrassaulted in the
lobby of her dorm after giving directions
to the guy. (her screams were left un—
answered); a girl hitching on Perimeter
Road.

According to Detective O‘Connor.
national statistics show that hitchiking by
college students is directly related to a
majority of crimes involving sexual
abuse, O'Conrior said that the overall in-

crease ol' public awareness has con- .

tributed to the increased number of
reported cases on campus. He also felt

police are more awarcofand sympathetic
to the situation.

Ihe Security lorcc feels that many if
not all of these instances could have been
avoided. Officer Patton offered these
suggestions:

I. Always walk in or near groups at
night. never alone.

2. Carry something with which to de-
fend yourself. such as a rolled newspaper
or pocketbook.

3. Stay in lighted and open areas.

4. lt'attaeked. get some positive iden-
tification of the individual. such as a scar
or other mark.

lhc important thing to remember is
that the more aware of the situation. the
less vulnerable. The college offers a self
delcnsc course for gym credit. It might
not he a bad idea for us to know what to
do. should it ever happen.

Yes. yes. we‘ve all hear the spiel: "If
you don‘t pick up your tax ear. your- nose
will fall off." “Carrying your tax 'card will
keep elephants away." and all that. But
I‘m not sure lhelicveit. l‘mjustnotsurc.
Matter of fact. an excellent case can be
made against those cardboard rectangles.
they make your wallet bulge own more.
They‘re not particularly artfully done.
they bend easily. get dirty. and look
crummy with all those numbers “it“‘d off.
Yet. despite this slew of anti-tax card
fodder. some Student Association peeple
still persist in insisting one should pick up
one‘s tax card.

You could trek up to the third floor of
the Campus Center and get one. But is
that the best thing you have to do with
your time???

Now. we all know that having a tax
card means you'll save more than halfthe
admission price on most movies. And a
couple of bucks on concert tickets. Okay.
big deal. But isnt‘t there an air about a
student who pays full price'.’ Something
that says: “I don't care about money.“

You are going to have to decide.

So. will you stop offat SA on the third
lloor the next time you're in the Campus
Center“!

It‘s your choice.
