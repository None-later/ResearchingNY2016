For the fifth time in the last six
yetirs. the NFC has shown that its

‘ strongest team is not as good as the

AFC‘ssuper bowl team. However. in
thrce‘ol'thc last four years. the N NJ
has won the season series of regular
season inter-league play.‘

Here-is a closer look at the teams
and their probable order of finish.
