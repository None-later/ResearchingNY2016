‘  “rrtou'rrr trim n:
can: '10 in: turns!"

There are two kinds of banjo freaks: them that
plays, and them that listens.

‘ If you’re either kind, Saturday, Septembng  your
kind of day. Because Pappy's Family Fun Pub and station
W.O. K. are throwing an incredible Banjo I amboree
and Contest.

IF YOU’RE A PLAYER iii
_ . If you play a great banjo, (or even a not so great 
banjo) just haul your frail body down to Pappy's and fill out an entry form.
IF YOU'RE A LISTENER  I

it
If you just love listening to banjos, there's only one thing better than 

a five hour banjo jamboree, and that's a free five hour banjo jamboree.

_ Just drop by Pappy's any time between noon and five—they'll be play—
ing all afternoon. (Look for the huge striped tent in front of our pub.)

IF YOU’RE A WINNER

We’ve got $1,500 set aside as prize money for our contest winners.
In the senior division, we’ll give $400 first prizes and $200 second
prizes for both picking and strumming. ($100 first prizes in our junior
division). There will also be a special prize for the person with the best
presentation, personality, Showmanship and costume. What's more
we figure everybody should be some kind of winner, so from noon tb
5 PM on Saturday, the 28th,. our pizza will be 1/2 price, and our "Peppy
Burger Special" will be $1.50 instead of $1.95.
