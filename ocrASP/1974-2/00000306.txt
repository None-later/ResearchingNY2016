AND WE ARE

ONLY ACROSS
THE STREET

 

by Paul Pelegall .

Three years I‘d known him.

_ I should say three years I‘d been ac-
quainted with him. No one really knew
him. Finally I discovered the reason for
his quietness and secretive nature. Until
then all anyone knew about him was
superﬁcial.

AlgU. Minium never got very close to
anyone while he was at college and I must
assume this was the pattern before he
came to State. While there he had
“friends” people he spoke with. and did
things with, but none were intimate with
him in any way. From the moment I met
him there was something about him
which Ingde me unealy even 

mi“ yew

 

He was very much into ‘ material
possessions. He owned an expensive
stereo.’a car. a toaster oven and a hot pot.
Only Ire ironed his clothes. Naturally. he
had a digital alarm clock.

Despite the fact that he was a pathetic
athlete (he was so stiff in all his motions)
his equipment was always the best.
Everyone else wore sneakers but AI had
expensive foreign made athletic shoes.

Since his father was an engineer for an
electronics ﬁrm he was quite well off and
bought anything he wanted. While the

,rest of us struggled to make ends meet he
never failed to whip a ten out of his
genuine leather wallet when he needed

One of the things Al had going for him
was that he was brilliant. He always knew
just what the professors wanted and he
did what they themselves would have

- done. Only he was better. All that he lack-

ed was creativity. The courses he took
were those which required the least
amount of imagination. Math and
economics were his majors but he took
enough social welfare courses to make it a
minor if he had needed one. He said he
took them because he wanted to beablc to
help people. many people. Yet he could
not carry on even one close relationship
with just one male or female. This was an
important thing I found out about Al. lt

resented. He said I was bossy and kicking

barriers I had to find a common subject. a
common hardship which we could share.

At the time ldecided to get close to Al I,

was having women trouble. trouble in the
sense that I hadn’t gone out with anyone
in months. As far as any of us knew AI

had never gone out with anyone but be ,'

It so happened that there were two girls
in the same suite that we liked. Aland I
talked for hours about them with our con-

had a line relationship with his parents
and never lacked affection. Al 'tis ah 'uys
referred to as “your son.“ this was not
too unusual but Al told me how he had
seen a look ofdisgust and revulsion on his
mother‘s face when she thought he wasn‘t
looking. .

What I thought would make Al break
the crust of ice which scparutcd him from
the rest of the people around him was a
date. So I decided to inject a little in—
itiative into him. since what he scvcrcly
lacked was confidence around women.
I‘ve seen himch so nervous around it girl
that he scwcd tt patch on his punts crook-
cd and Al is a perfectionist.

After so nmny setbacks. I needed a kick
in the butt myself to ask out a girl. I
figured this would be therapy for both of
us. We made an agreement that catch of us
would ask out the girl we pi'cscntlyhaiVL-zi
crush on.

short order and now the pressure was on

, Al. He was so nervous he was freaking

out. He was ready to give up and hadf

he would continue being a loner. His

' our relationship was built on one com-

mon interest all he had to do was find if
link with the girl to start things off.
Armed with this his confidence was at
least momentarily bolstered and he burst
from his seat. The speed with which he
generally made up his mind and acted was
another aspect of his machine-like nature
that always made me shudder upon
witnessing it. Still he had overcome it
great fear of his and l was sure this ex-
perience would make him act more
human towards everyone. Matty times
