Parallax: ' Familiar View

Alan Friedman

The Parallax View is a thriller in
every .sense of the word. This
suspense—packed, nerve-shattering
film will keep you on the edge of
'your sent through its cntireduration..
As an Oregon investigative jour-
nalist exploring the intrigue of
political assassination. Warren licat-
ty is excellent. He is backed up by a
line cast. The film‘s credibility and
even probability. due to its
similarities to reality. make it an ex-
tremely frightening contemporary
drama. Alan J. l’akluka's direction
and manipulative photography keep
the tension running throughout the
film.

Although Warren Beatty has-the
only major role in the ﬁlm.‘it does
not suffer because of it. Paula Pren-
tiss and Hume ‘Cronyn ars excellent
in their secondary roles. and Walter
McGinn. as l’arallax‘s emissary.
does a fine job in making the viewer
feel uncomfortable. His portrayal is
characterized by emotional com-
lness. The movie creates an at-
mosphere that will not leave you
when you exit from the theater.
Don‘t be surprised ifaftcrwards you
find yourself just the least hit

The Parallax View is a_
meticulously made. sophisticated,
film. However there are a couple of
unanswered questions that may
hothcruthc viewer afterwards. such as
what l’arallax‘s goal. their
motivation“! Although there are
these questions. the movie is strong-
enough and fast moving enough so
that you probably won‘t be bothered
by them until you ponder the film
afterwards: and you will nonder it.

'there's‘a surprisingtbing about it; it
all seems like so much fun. and no

One scene, (of rather peripheral.

no scenes in this lilm which are not).
is the hero‘s trip to the drug store to

by Joseph Daugherty

There is an Evening of Invaders
tonight. The International Film
Group is showing three hours of

. ' wholesale destruction in the foim of

‘ two more films from‘ the American
Fifties; George Pal's ‘and Byron‘
Haskin‘s film of Wells‘ The War of

the Worlds and' Ray Harryhausen‘s
and Fred Sear‘s Eath Versus the
Flying Saucers. ' .

'l‘heré‘s a special sub~genre of the

. science fiction ﬁlm which can only be

called “.Filmic S and M.“ or ﬁlms
which show otir little planet getting
the living daylights beaten out of it
by groups of outer space bad guys.

This week‘s films show two aspects'

of this sub-genre.

Alter the success of l’al‘s low key
Destination Moon. the producer
was able to work with larger budgets
and better talents. Next to The Time
Machine. War stands as his best
known \vork. llarre Lyndon‘s script
moves the Wells novel to southern

California and updated it to the year

of the film's production. l9§3.

Very little of the Welles story is
left and is replaced by a grand
’l‘cchnicolor and VistaVison display
ol earth under the Martians. The
Iilm is an example of a trait which
runs through most big studio
American Sci-ii. a trait stated by

John Banter in his book Sciém’e Flo
lion in Ihe Cinema as “...bent [on]
creating a literaldepiction of the fan-

tastic rather than evokinga mood.“ .

That “literal depiction" is carried off

quite well by Gordon Jennings and;
the Paramount special effects unit. ‘

‘ ‘l'he lilm has some very effective
sequences such as the scene in which
the hero (scientist Gene Barry) and
the ‘Minister‘s daughter (the ever
hyst'cric Ann Robinson) find
themselves trapped in a collapsed
farm house surrounded by the
sinister and strangely beautiful hat-
like war machines controlled by the
Martians.

All btrt two shots in the film were
made on a studio sound stage and
this artificial reality gives the film a
haunting surrealistic look. And on
the other hand there is Earth Versus
the Firing Saucers.

While the sul'ipl and direction of
Strut-err (Columbia. I956) is not up
to the Phi standards ol‘sliekncss. the
film works and succeeds on other
levels. The ﬁlm is worth watching if
only for the matchlcss special effects
at Ray Harryhausen. Harryhausen
is one ol the few melt who has been
able to take the concept of special
effects and raise it to the level of an

art form. The ﬁlm was made on a
much tighter budget than the Pal

film and. unable to spend largesums.

to build massive sets. the ﬁlm was
forced out into the sun to use real
locations. While the Martians in
War vattack studio cities. the In-
vaders i'n Saucers destroy “real”
buildings.

By no means is Saucch a true
"classic". but it must stand as one of
the most watchable films of the past
