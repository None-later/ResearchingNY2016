Although it is quite rare,-a game
will beylound to contain-only a small

‘ number of ‘ sniall mistakes oc.

casionally. Such a game is an artistic
achievement to be cherished. The
following game is almost illustrative

of this:

Notes: (a) This merely reinforces

white‘s pawn center and allow/s him
to shift his attention to the king side

and especially the now open KB file. i

(b) For the next few moves. black
has to cope with the threat of white

ed. - ' s

it is apparent that the cause of
block‘s bad game was his 11th move
which opened up the KBl'ilc. and
bolstered White‘s pawn center. This
should be a good lesson on the im-
portance 'of evaluating the positional
consequences of such captures.
