There can be no better way to
describe Lawrence §mulian‘s works
than to say. that they are indeed
heavily “peopled”. 0n close inspec-
tion of his paintings one can see the
very deﬁnite. effectiveness of this
emphasis on facial expressions as a
way to communicate a whole‘spec-
trum of feelings and emotions.

I found the huge. feathery pain-
tings of Jondra Nolan to bethe most
aesthetically pleasing in the exhibit.
There is an intense similarity of
design in all her works on display.
She makes a deﬁnite use of her par-
ticular britsh strokes and what she
calls "organic related form.“ One
does not have to stretch the imagina-
tion to perceive the close
relationship between , Ms. Nolan‘s
organic forms and the organs of the
body. especially the brain and the
stomach.

The styles of the artists who are
participating in the exhibit at
SUNYA are most certainly distinct
and unrelated.

' Albany’s Past and More

by Alan Frledmann

A short, ﬁfteen minute walk from
Draper Hall down Washington
Avcnttc brings you to the Albany lit-
stitutc of History and Art. and if
history is your thing it might well be
worth the walk. If an is your fancy.
you‘d better have a great love for
Edwin Austin Abbey and porcelain
figurines. or the museum is not likely
to satisfy you.

Most of the institute‘s paintings
are works by Edwin Austin Abbey. I
found his watercolors. and pen and
inks quite beautifully detailed and

realistic. but his oils left me cold. 0'

What I found most interesting
were the historical exhibits. On the
upper floor of the Institute. Dutch
colonial Albany comes alive. This
exhibit may help anyone taking
colottittl history. Matty furnishings
and utensils ofthc era are on display.
as are several period paintings. An
eighteenth century English room
which was transported intact over
tltc Atlantic pinc walls and all. also
sits on exhibit. As yoti walk through
it you can feel the history in the
beautiful furnishings. Included in
the room is a charming 1798 piano
lortc.

Down in the basement is more of
Albany‘s history. Nineteenth cen-
tury Albuny stands vividly before
your eyes in the prints of James R.
Dul'l’ty (on display through ()9—
tohcr). Egyptian artifacts share the
basement with Dutch Albany. On

Diverse Talents

l havc heard it said that it per-

and is at his best in concert. From
this it follows that in order to proper-
ly appreciate a musician like I)ll\l(l
lirombcrg we should see llllll in cott—
cert and listen to his most recent
album.

In :i live appearance llrombcrg is
loose, funny. and backed up by a

only by the star of tltc show. On

there. they fill out lirombcrg‘s
music. and are more than a rhythm
