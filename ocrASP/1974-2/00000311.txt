tstinguished publ service by adopting its discriminatory. antiatudent housing or-

I‘ "T dinanee; In that tinie.-due in large measure to the efforts of student leaders, that bill has _

"net received the signature of . Mayor Erastus Corning. While the fate of the Three

‘Thousand off-campus students hangs in the balance, the Mayor has promised that he

. will not act? on the bill for a few weeks at least. pending the submission of counter
proposals; He also promised that he would contact student officials at least one week

7 before signing the bill.' a ' V .

' t Central Council Chairperson David Coyne warned that theconciliatory move by the
Mayor was simply an effort to stall for time. hoping that in the interim. the controversy
will die down. Student Association President Pat Curran was more optimistic. saying
that he trusted Corning was earnestly seeking to reach an effective compromise.

Through it all. President Benezet an d Off-campus Housing DirectorJoseph Searing
have maintained a disconcertineg aloof position through this. one of the most critical
challenges to student security. Their self-servingdisinterest is of no help to the students
and mayin fact leave them literally stranded. ‘

Students have been clamoring to take action. threateninga total boycott of Albany
merchants if the bill is not totally defeated. Weare fully in sympathy with their motives,
as the merchants will most fully feel the weight of the students if they no longer receive
their business. While action is often an effective political device. perhaps it will, in the
long run. prove to be counter-productive. and serve only to alienate those whose sup-
port we need. -

We realize that it is difficult for students to sit idly by while secretive and intangible

discussions are being held in the Mayor's ofﬁce. In light ofthe somewhat hostile attitude
on the part of Albany ‘rcsidents and politicians. we reluctantly recommend that the
students refrain from acting in a way that might furtherjeopardize their own interests,
at least temporarily. if the delay is a delay without substance. then, and especially then
it will be time to act. For the moment. our interests can best be served by supporting the
Student Association in Jits struggle against an adverse political machine.

The Primary, Posses

Surprising the professional pollsters. the veteran vote watchers. and probably

' himsell'as well. Hugh Carey won the Democratic primary Tuesday. with a 200.000 vote

margin. The significance of the primary is minimized when we realize that the voter

turnout. only 25% of the eligible Democrats. was among the lowest in recent primary
history. Carey‘s margin is. nevertheless. impressive.

One thing is certain. Thcgubernatorial race was a cheap. dirty and undistinguishcd
attempt by each of the two competitors to discredit his opponent in order to garner
votes for himself. The voter reaction to the barrage of accusations by Howard Samuels

“against Mr. Careyis probablya good indication that the New York electorate isa good
deal more mature and reasonable than it is generally given credit for. Mr. Carey. for his
part. conducted himself in an almost equally unprofessional manner.

(iovcrnor Malcolm Wilson. however. has so many faults of his own that it would be
counter-productive. as well as totally illogical. to let these primary wounds split the
Democratic ’arty in a year that they have a solid chance to regain strength in this state.
This campaign was disappointingly lacking debates on the issues. and was far too
abundant in such ploys as personality smears. But. it would be sad indeed if the
Democrats cannot emerge victorious over the wreckage of the Republican party this
fall. '

'l he primary is over in more ways than one. Mr. Carey is now charged with the task
of uniting a traditionally split party. without whoscsupport he will not succeed in un-
scaling Wilson and permanently removing the taint of Rockefeller from the state
political scene.

Mocking Americon Justice

Upon Richard Nixon‘s resignation from of-
lice last month. one major question about the
Watergate calamity remained unanswered.
The question gnawed at all Americans.
Sliotild Richard Nixon be brought intou court
of law and be tried for his actions in the
Watergate affair? For the first time in otir
history. the nation faced the spectre of a
former Chief Executive being brought to trial
and given it prison term.

the legal status oI'Citizen Nixon remained
iti tibcyancc until this week. Then. with one
proclamation. President Ford put to rest any
doubts about Mr. Nixon‘s accountability for
his roles in the Watergate scandal. Ford
granted Nixon a cotiiplclc and total pardon
lroni prosecution. In that one sweep of
presidential action (ierald Ford made a
burlesque ol justice in America.

President Ford‘s action violates the spirit of
the Constitution and dcalsu scvcrc blow to thc
impartiality of American law. Ford has aban-
doned two articles ofAmerican faith - that no
man is above the law and that all men are
equal in the eyesof the law. In effect. Mr. Ford
has created ' the disaslcrous and tan
conscioniible situation of having II dual system
ofjusticc'. II system for the rich and powerful
itiid one for the ordinary individual. How can
we as it nation continue to respect the laws of
the land - laws that are supposedly enforced in
ii nonbiased nittnncr - when Mr. Ford dis-
penses justice iii such an uneven. inequitable
way'.’

Mr. Ford‘s action is comparable to conferr-
ing immiitiity from prosecution upon Hitler
rind only trying the henchmen Wilt r tairricd out
his plans. President Ford seems i be 'il‘i‘i-ij‘,
his stamp of approval to a very dutii '
rice; the precedent of a chicl‘cxccniitc ‘
commits a crime while serving his term uni. w
capes accountability for his misdeeds simply
by resigning his office.

in granting the pardon. Mr. Ford referred

I u, MII'C Waist-
to the great anguish Mr. Nixon has experienc-
ed recently. Mr. Ford and those who approve
of his action feel that by resigning Mr. Nixon
has already been "hung" and there was no
need to “draw and quarter" him. No doubt.
the relinquishing of his Presidency has caused
Mr. Nixon to suffer great ctnotiotial pains.
However other aspects of his fall from power
have not been as punitive. Mr. Nixon still has
his California and Florida nutnsions. houses
which were improved at considerable expense
to the American taxpayer. Mr. Nixon is en-
titlcd to a Iiiigc pcnsioti. ii $|tltl.t)(l(l a year
allotment for staff expenses. rind Secret Scr-
vicc protcctioti. In addition to this
munil'iccncc President Ford has asked Con-
gress to appropriate $450.000 to
facilitate Mr. Nixon‘s transition from
President to private citizen. Mr. Nixon mayb-
tormented mentally. btit lie is not cxtictlz
leading an existence that resembles life iii
Sing-Sing.

llic pardon was also a grave error as turns
the ttpcoiiiiiig Watergate trials itre concerned.
Mr. Ford has let it ruinous “double standard“
develop. Ford is saying that a taped conver-
sationts) between l-laldctnun and Nixon in
which the Watcrgtttc covcrup was discussed
ciiii bciiscd to prosecute one btit not the other.
Furthermore. Mr. Ford is saying that the
agents who carried ottt the leader‘s illegal tic-
tioiis can be prosecuted. bitt the man who
ordered ttic actions can not be punished. One
need not be it legal scholar to appreciate the
hypocrisy and unfairness in such tl situation.

Those who oppose the pardon did not want
Richard Nixon to be prosecuted out ofu feel-
ing of spite or viiidictiveness. They wanted
i-‘it-Iini-il Nixon tried to show that in America
it“ itl‘“ lilllS on everybody with equal weight -
ii-giurdlcss of who you are or who you ones
were. Iltit. Gerald Ford with his capricious
and imperious order has mudcu mockery out
of ttic judicial system.

;. Time for Democrats

To the editor

Now that the people of New York have
made their decision. and the smoke has
cleared. we find that Hugh Carey is the victor.
In a promise that Ihad made to myself and
Others I now support Hugh Carey of the in-
eopctcncc which now calls himself governor.

It is important for all those who had sup-
ported Howard Samucls to now rally behind
the Democratic Standard Bearer. All those
who know me and have read what I have had
to say know Iiow I supported Howard for the
position on Governor. It‘s hard to admit that
you are wrong. but in thisc 'cthc issue wasn‘t
right or wrong but who We felt could do the
bcstjob. lask again all those who supported
Howard it is important to come around and
make sure that Malcolm Wilson doesn‘t get
elected in November!

If you are interested in. your well beingus a
student it‘s important that Carey wins! If you
are interested in free Student government it is
important that Carey wins! If you are iii-
terested in a free student press then it‘s impor-
tant that Carey' wins! Ifyoti are interested in
the State of New York it‘s important that
Carey wins! If you~are interested about the
cost of beer it's important that Carey wins! If
you are interested in repeal ol'tlicabusivcdriig
laws it‘s importiint that Carey wins!

The Republicans have never given the
students reason to support tlic‘rn."'Every iriovc
they have made has been anti-student and pro—
big business.

Let‘s tnakc sure that Hugh Carey becomes
our next Governor. and the Republicans stay
out!

Correct TM

To the editor:

Regarding Daniel (iaincs' article on
I ransccndcntal Meditation (ASP. Sept. 6). it
is important to note that TM is a specific.
albeit. a natural and easy practice. As iii any
practice. there is a correct and incorrect
procedure. it I M is practiced correctly. it af-
Iords the mcditator with increased alertness.
more energy. atid a development of creativity
in all aspects ol his life. And if practiced cor-
rectly the process is charming in and ofitsclf.

ll practiced incorrectly. however. the
nicditator will experience exactly the symp-
toms reported by Mr. (iaincs: lediousncss.
lack ol charm. dullness of mind. Due to in-
correct practice the meditator soon begins to
Iiiid it inconvenient to meditate.

Ilccatisc now and then a nicditator may fall
into incorrch practice. SIMS provides every
mcditatot' with a lilctiiiic lollow-up program.
to assure that the simple and easy guidelines
Ior correct meditation are maintained. One
aspect of this lolluw-up is Personal Checking.
to assure correctness of experience. Another
aspect istlic Advanced Lcetures.to assure cor-
rect intellectual understanding of TM and its
relationship to the evolution ofconsciousncss.

I sincerely encourage anyone who Iiastakcn
l M instruction and is dissatisfied in any way
to call the SIMS Center (72 Fuller Road. 438-
5550) lot an appointment for personal check-
iiig or to attend the advanced lectures given
every Sunday evening. 7:30. Humanities 354.
I licsc will serve to renew both the charm and
the benefits ol I'M by assuring correctness of

SUNYA. what is your problem?!
I am a Visiting Student from New Paltz.
From the very moment of my arrival here I

is as follows: I was all set to check in. baggage

.the next day I went to registration to

problems and assist the veterans as well. This
may sound like sour grapes and self pity
because I haven‘t gotten my check. I feel that
Albany is the exception. not the rule of
