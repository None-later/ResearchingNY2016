he poster on this“ appeared in

:tlie I974 Torch. Though it represents

’ an Israeli viewpoint on the Middle

‘ ' East conflict. it was intended as a sad

and ; bitter geomment on the
senselessness of all war.

The poster on the right appears at'
the request of Arab students at
SUNYA. Understandably, they are
offended by the reference to the

A lsraelis‘“enemies.“ Therefore. Stu-
" dent Association. which is publisher‘
‘of the Torch. has agreed to provide
this opportunity for the Arabs to
present their side. SA itselftakes no
position. but wishes to air the dis-

'pute.

The underlying melssage of both
posters is the same: We are born as
equals. .not as enemies. We should
learn to live. work. and worship in
peace. and not waste the lives of
young men in wars: born of mis-
trust. misunderstanding. and hatred.

Each of us brings to this university
her/ his own cultural heritage. and a
sense of pride in that heritage. We
are many. we are diverse'. and we
each have our own beliefs.

But are we here'to profess our own
beliefs. or to discover and perhaps
understand the beliefs of others?

:QbykmnuhAMumo

With the Miami Dolphins

 looking to defend their title, the

American Football Conference
opens its season this weekend.
Here is a brief analysis.

Eastern

MIAMI: Czsonka, Kiick and
Warl'ield are lame ducks. but the
personnel isjust as good as last
year. They lost a great coach in

' Arnsparger and Buonicotti is a

year older. Despite this. the
defense should be no worse than
last year. If Shula can motivate
them. they should win their divi-
sion.

BUFFALO: ‘0.J. probably
won't rush for two thousand
yards but he will be the key man.
If he has another good year the
passing game will be set up. Joe
Ferguson hasa second year ot'ex-
perience under his belt. The
defense is improving despite the
lack of publicity. Lack of depth
may be a problem.

NEW YORK: Namath is back
and if he stays healthy, he will
keep them in almost any game.
Riggins must return to his form
of two years ago in order for the
running game to gel. Defense isa
question mark. as it is being
rebuilt under new coach Charlie
Winner.

BAL'IIMORIE: The Colts are
still rebuilding after their house
cleaning. Still hoping that lIcrt
Jones! is their quarterback.
Defense is young and inex-
perienced but will get better.

N l5 \\ l’ NOLANI): Jim
I’lunkctt has been much malign-
ed lor inconsistency but it‘s
tough to throw from the
ground. Improving all the time
on tlelcnse. they‘re still a year or
two away lrom making the big
move.

Central

PITTSBURGH: Joe Gilliam
gets to start and l'erry Bradshaw

is right behind.- The choice of
quarterbacks has polarized this
team before. Franco Harris must
return to his form of two years
ago. Joe Greene and Dwight
White lead a real good defense.

ClNCINNA’l'If’l‘hey had the
most strike-breakers and should
be in the best shape. Their
weakest point is middle
linebacker where Bob Bergy used
to roam. Ken Anderson does
the throwing as l’a til Brown does
his thinking. Isaac Curtis is their
deep threat.

CLEVELAND: In this tight
division Cleveland could shine.
Mike Phipps has to show it now
and (ing Pruitt will start from
the beginning. The defense must
improve and probably isn‘t
strong enough to stop Pittsburgh.
and Cincinnati.

HOUSTON: llbtiston is
already having a bad year.
Players are jumping even though
they have contracts. Houston’s

Western 

OAKLAND: Two lame duck
quarterbacks lead the team
which at least on paper has the
best shot of winning. They have
good receivers. line backs and a
good defense. But then
Oakland‘s had that for years.
(ieorge Blanda is still around
kicking.

DENVER: The surprise team
last year is moving forward. If
Charlie Johnson can get one
more year out of his old arm and
Floyd Little keeps running. the
offense is set. The defense needed

division. Yet it last yearwas nota‘

KANSAS CITY: Ler’i Dawson. '
is back and during theexhibition
season looked recovered. But he
is brittle and back-up Mike
Livingston hasn't proved a thing.
The defense is being rebuilt and
looks like it has gelled. Their
season depends on. Dawson.

SAN DIEGO: Dan Fouls is
stepping into Johnny Unitas‘,
shoes and will be in trouble. New
coach Tommy l’rotho claims the
team will surprise. but in this-
division it will be tough to im-.
prove on fourth place.

A new season is upon us.

which means another try at pick-
ing the learns:
Dallas over Atlanta by 5. Ciaig
Morton is leaving but with
