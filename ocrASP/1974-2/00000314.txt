*Scrimmage Hudson Valley

by Bruce Maggln

Optimism continues to reign with
the Albany football learn. as it ap-
proaches its season opener with
llol'stra a week from tomorrow.
after conrpletely dominating Union
College in a scrimmage last Satur<
day.

Coticlr llob icord was pleased with
ltis team‘s performance. "The team is
much improved over last year's tciini
at this time. We're executing much
better.“ Whether the improvement is
enough to put Albany on par with
llofstra is yet to be answered.

' Last year ilofstrri was outstan-
ding. finishing SJ and ninth in the
Lambert Bowl voting. The game
ligures to be a pretty tough challenge
for Albany but Ford still remains
confident about the outcome. “We
can beat Hofstra. but we must pla

our best possible game." r

Hotstra lnexperienced

The Danes might not have to peak
against Hofstra. as the Long
Islanders have only seven returning
starters. . Hofstra's coach Howie
Myers has so far not been en-
couraged by his team‘s progress for
the coming salon. “Our team isvery
inexperienced. We lack siu....l am
worried about being able to stay on
the same field with Albany."

Opposing coaches. though. are
ltn'lWlbto euggerate their situation.
lloi’stra plays a much tougher
schedule than Albany. so a mediocre
Hofstru  still give Albany a,
great deal of trouble.

Ford still knows little about
Ilofstra. “They area multiple offen-
sive rind defensive team. They have it
great deal of skill at the skill
positions.“ The outstanding .players
on llofstra rrre Tom Coalter. their
punter and wide receiver tirtd Mark
illankmeyer. a linebacker.

Danes lst on Astroturf

l-lol'stra will have two advantages
against the Danes. They will hrrvc
one game under their belts. as they
open their season tomorrow versus
Lehigh. The Dunes will also be play-
ing on ristroturf for the first time.

The Dani-s” offense showed a con-
tinual ability to more tire ballagainst
Union in their scrimmage. but Union
is far from a good team. so the
Danes‘ performance should be taken
into perspective.
'“Fullback Tommy Delilois was
outstanding. as he scored twice. The
other running backs. according to
Ford. "were respectable". Quarter-
backs John llertulzi. Dave Ahonen
and Ray ‘Dupree were all able to
move the team quite well. Ford felt

that Dave Sheuchenko was the out-

standing playeron the offensive line.

Ford Pleased With Defense

Coach Ford was pleased with his
defense especially at cornerback.
“Corncrbaclts llarry McDonough.
Bruce Cummings and Billy Brown

all looked good. Defensive tackles'

Frank Villnnova and Dom Pagno

also played well.“

()n the negative side for the Danes
is tlte fact that injuries prevented
Albany from testing sortie new per-
sonnel at two key positions. The big
questions still remain at tight end
rrrtd at one ol'the defensive end spots.
Saturday morning‘s scrimmage .
against lltrdson Valley will help
clear up that problem for Ford.
Albany came out of the scrimmage
witli the usual brrrrrps and brrrises
with the only major injury being a
sprained tiirklc by Ty Curran.

stealing the greatest part of the

23 Hopefuls

Under the experienced eye of
Coach Richard "Doc" Sauers twenty
three hopefuls teed off today in the
first of two qualifying rounds that
will determine the seven man roster.
The second Ill hole match will take
place this Sunday over the (ditto-plus

whistle bad sounded. Technically.

.that' probably should have been a

goal. and a stupid mistake could
have cost us again."

Between halves. Schieffelin
reminded his team that the English
had only landed the night before.
and would tire if pressed. Schieffelin
warned that. “They would probably
try to stall and slow the tempo“. and
urged his team to “Move the ball.“

At first. it looked like Schicffelin
had misjudged the opposition. as
South Hampton scored quickly with
the Dane defense “screwing up
again". forcing the committing of a
foul in the penalty zone. the resulting
free kick beating Obwald.

AndthCn...South Hampton went
completely flat. The old Dane

several near misses. (iarroway riﬂed
a direct kick rebound into the net.
Two minutes later. Garroway did it
again. this time on a Ruano center-
ing pass.

The Danes continued to control
play. with nothing resembling

end.‘ th. numerous Dane oppor-
tunities went high. wide. or were sav-
ed by the visitor‘s defenseand goalie.

Typical of the lackluster play at
this point wasa midfield direct kick
by South Hampton. on which only
one forward went dowul‘ield.

With 3 minutes left. Chcpe Ruano
booted a Jerry Lee Hing rebound in.

for the ﬁnal tally.

“This was not the team that lost 4-
i to Hartwick.“ said J.V. Coach Don
Prozik. “We played together, and
showed a one million percent im-
provement."

Schieffelin. while pleased with the
win. was not completely satisﬁed.
“We are still making mistakes. and
against good teams like South
Hampton. they will cost us. Each of
their goals came on our own mis-
takes. They took advantage of our
errors. and you cannot make mis-
takes against ri good team and expect
to get away with it.“

Typical of the visitors' comments
were those of captain Chris Booker:
“Your lads played very Well. We‘ll
have to have another go at it soon.“

“Your defense is good. your mid-
field play is good. but your forwards
just do not seem to complete your
plays with goals". said visting coach
Nick Striker.

 Lone   I,   

' wyer Raps

by Ellen Eekstekt

Speaking as the lone dissenting
vote on the recently passed Housing
Ordinance. Albany Common Coun-
cilman David Sawyer. in an inter-
view last week said: “I
M.“ do not think there will
in the be mass evictions [of
students] although
the potential istherc.“
Sawyer. who fought an uphill battle
in the courts to get his name on the
ballot. was elected to the Common
Council last November. Since
January he has worked to represent
his |2th ward which runs from Cen-
tral to Madison Avenues and from
Lake Street to Main Avenue encom-

passing some 7500 people.

News

There are In wards which com-
prise the Common Council.

Sawycr. sitting comfortably in his
living room. elaborated on the hous-
ing ordinance which affects some
90% of the city. He explained that
the Council had before it three
separate bills each specifying a
different quota of unrelated persons
in a single living unit. The proposal
establishing three rrrirelatcd persons
as the limit was the one passed two
weeks before. While MayorCor'ning
had no influence upon this decision.
the Neighborhood Associations did.

~"The trldcrmen.“ . said Sawyer. “felt

 

is

they had to do something arid
nothing else was available. Unfor-
trrmitely the billdoes not hit the main
problem.“

The main problem is that ol
absentee landlords. Some landlords.
said Sawyer. live as far from their
houses as Massachusetts. The
landlords are glrrd to rent to students
since they can get them to pay nrore.
continues Sawyer. the city is lryirrg
to get people to come back from the
stibrrrbs. while the students. said
Sawyer. are in effect pushing the
larrrilies out. especially since Albany
has such art acrrtelrotisingshortrigc.

sort ha riotist deteriorated within

added Sawyer.

‘lfthcexisting housing codes Were
to be enforced the landlords would
have to keep the houses up.“ The
people. he continued. just do not
realize this and therefore do not
know what to do. Sawyer claimed
that "the hill restricts people's living
patterns.instead we should push the
city to enforce the laws it already has
in the books.“

At ﬁrst. Sawyerexplained, the law
stated that “people related by blood
or marriage could only live
together.“ it was then changed to
read that “one or more ' persons
cohabitating together constitute a
family“ and there could only be one
family to a house. But neither of
these laws Were ever really enforced.
The present bill will not be retroac-
tive rind therefore students presently
living off-campus are assured of
housing at least through this winter.
Sawyer feels that the bill will
probably be enforced upon the basis
of what comes up: such as com-
plaints against the students.

The problem runs deeper than the
wording of the housing ordinance.
The present squeeze on student
housing calls fora “constructive ap-
proach by the university to the
problem.“ He suggested that maybe
the university should limit applicants.

to Draper and return Mohawk

native housing for students.

On Housing Bar

investigated this. found that the
landlord did not havea building per-
mit and worked towards terminating
the action.

David Sawyer proposes enforce-
ment byjudicial review instead of by
law as the housing ordinance states.
He wants there to be allowances for
special situations. The proposal
would have the people wishing to
rent a dwelling and the landlord pre-
sent their case to the housing board.
The housing board would then
decide. He said that he was “not try-
ing to create ntore rooming
housings" but that he wanted to at
least provide an rtlternativc for peti-
plc who have nowhere else to go.

Theonepositivcthingtocorneout
of this ordinance. said Sawyer. is
that it "brought housing to the
forefront of the city‘s attention."

David Sawyer. 12th Ward Alderman. discusses the  bill. He'
thinks the law will not solve the problem.

 

i Resisters Hesitant on Amnesty ’
