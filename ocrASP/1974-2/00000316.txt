". ' Three radar unit'sha've accidently become part of Dr. Kenneth Able’s study
. I, of bird migration. The project. now in its early stages. is being ﬁnanced by a
$35,000 National Science‘Foundation grant.

“The additional. radars were never requested.” said Dr. Able. a professor in I  4"

the biology Department who directs the Cranberry Lake Program. Only two
,‘had been sought and granted by the Ofﬁce of Naval Research. butduringthe
_ summer: three more units “spontaneously” appeared at the east end of the
Academic Podium. The two.that Dr. Able officially requested had been
delivered in March. 1974.' l ‘

;

Dr. Able couldn‘t explain the arrival of the new units other than
speculating that there had been-u computer error. Now that the radar is here.
the Office of Naval Research doesn’t want it back. The Korean units were
valued‘at S |50,000 each when ﬁrst manufactured. They will now be used for
spare parts and are available for others to use in research endeavors. s’aid
Able.

The added units have already proved useful. This summer a scaffold used
by painters fell off the east end of the Podium destroying the antenna of one
radar unit. A replacement was taken from one of the “accidental” units.

Able‘s research is aimed at examining factors which determine direction
birds take while migrating. Such factors include wind and cloud cover. His
research in this field has spanned the last six years. Work in this areais par-
ticularly useful to the aviation industry as birds ﬂying at high altitucs have
been known to be sucked into jet engines. Conservationists are concerned
with the threat to wildlife aside from the financial burden for industry.

l)r. Able had hoped to commence the actual field work by May. l974.
Problems in making the unused radar functional delayed the project until the
beginning of September.

The radurohservations are being made from the Helderberg“Mountains"
near Bernc. New York. This site. twenty miles southwest ofAlhany isdistrint
enough to prevent interference by tall structures such as the dormitory
towers.

Europe Still Holds Jobs for Students

Some student air fares to Europe
are still in effect. Youth fares and
other reduced air fares being sold in
Canada and Mexico. and continued
use of school charter flights all make
Europe still very much available to
travel minded college students»—
cven in the face of ever increasing in-
ternational air fares. As always.
students living in the eastern states
have less to pay than students at
western schools.

Also. lower winter rates offer
skiers inexpensive trips to Austrian
and Swiss slopes. One student ski
trip is only $550 including the round
trip flight ticket and accom-
modations during two weeks on the
Austrian slopes. General American
tourism to Europe was offsornewhat
this past summer. As a result. many
Austrian ski resorts are dropping
their rates for the winter ski crowd.

Facilities Office Goes Caulking

by Peter Feller

If you have awakened one mor-
ning to the sound of a painter on a
scaffold rccaulking your dorm. this
will be your first. but probably not
your only contact with the Facilities
Office here on campus.

The Facilities Office, headed by
Joel 'l'ruc. handles Physical Plant
projects done by outside contrac-
tors. lt is responsible for the sixty
buildings (uptown and downtown)
on SUNYA's 420-acre campus.

Also. the steady climb of the US.
dollar against falling European
currencies further decreases the cost
of a trip to Europe.

For students staying in Europe
longer than a 2-week ski fling, tem-
porary paying jobs are also
available. Most jobs are in
restaurants. hotels. and ski resorts.
Standard wages are paid. but the big
saving is the free room and board
that goes with each job!

Any interested student may obtain
free travel information and job
application form by writing to SOS.

Europe. Job processing can be
spccdcd up by obtaining and holding
3 passport sire photos and a letter of
recommendation from a teacher or
school official.

The painters on campus have a
two-fold job. They are recaulking
the dorms and weather proofing the
ceiling material. a task completed
last spring. They should be ﬁnished
within ﬁfteen days. 'l‘rue said. “All
the windowsund doors except in In-
diun Quad are made of steel. and in
order to protect and prevent them
from rusting. they're to be
periodically painted idmny‘ at ﬁve
year intervals."

'l'ruc answered the query of
whether the school will be able to
hold more people next year saying
that right now theonly way will bc to
increase occupancy over designated
capacity.

Last year. the Facilities Office
replaced the curbing rind resurfaced
all of Perimeter Road (4.2 miles
long). made acoustical im-
provcnrcrits in the lecture centers.
replaced the exterior concrete stair
treads. and put an elevator in the
Linear Accelerator Building.

budgetary restrictions hamper
fulfilling all the requests filed for the
Facilities Office. Projects are in-
dividually requested and approved.
Although Albany State is a very
young campus. proper campus
maintenance is essential.

'l we surmised. “We would like to
keep the plant standing physically
attractive. so that the students can
continue their academic pursuits in
the proper physical environment
suitable for this task.“

"A woman came up to me in a

Smith is in the unustiiil irition of
being an incumbent 'DA ; without
ever having L run for office. His
predecessor r Arnold. V‘Proskin.
resigned midway through his term to
become a county Judge. Smith was
then appointed by Governor Wilson
to fill the position. At the time of his
appointment Smith was the assistant

in a speech before the Young
Republicans Club of Albany State.
Smith explained his unfamiliarity
with politics.

August Crime Rate Rises

pared to the same month last year. The value of stolen property ntore than doubled. increasing l22‘;b from

"The only real complaint mylop-

Smith refuted. "They may be young.

Drug trials are at large part of the

“I‘m glad it's so. tough on the
