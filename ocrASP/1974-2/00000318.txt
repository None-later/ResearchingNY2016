' Ma chutetts‘ Senator Edward M. Kennedy announced yesterday his'deeision not to

’ "seek l’ rt ‘i nomination for the presidency in I976. He’t'erme'd his decision “ﬁrm,
‘t‘inalan unconditional.“j citing commitment to his family as his main reason.

. cl di gaiiy thoughts in that direction. Kennedy said further that he wouldactively
oppose ny attempts at a draft at the‘eonvention. . ‘ '
Ken dy‘s withdrawal accentuates his central status in the Democratic Party. as the ,
three-r maining top candidate possibilities. Jackson of Washington. Bentsen of Texas

i and’Mondale of Minnesota. all admitted that a contest without Kennedy would at least
.be a contest. Kennedy. himself. in his announcement in Boston said that his

withdrawal “will permit others who have been interested in gaining the nomination the

chance for exposure..." realizing his stature as the Democratic front-runner.

The nation will no doubt greet the Kennedyannouncement with curiousambivalence:
grateful that the sordid mess of Chappaquidick willnot bedragged through the media
as the election approaches. grateful that the nomination will not be clouded by the in-
evitable Kennedy mystique, yet disheartened that the young senator will not be given
the chance to complete the two aborted attempts of his older brothers. and unhappy
that it will not be a Kennedy that finally. ever. binds thedeepwounds ofthis country.

Kennedy is right in his appraisal that his withdrawal will throw open the field to
anyone in the Democratic Party. In the free-for-all that will probably result in the

wake of his announcement. the issues and the candidates will bare themselves to the _

scrutiny of a suspicious and exasperated public. Fresh ideas will hopefully emerge
from this cainpaignfresh faces and new goals for America as it starts its third century.
'I here is no single. strong personality on the horizon with a solid chance to defeat a
Rockefeller or a Ford. but there are still over two years remaining. Given the uncanny
ability of the Ford Ad ministration to focus public opinion against itself._it would not
be at all surprising (or disappointing for that matter) if Ford deprives himsell and the

' Republicans of the White House in I976.

We needn‘t be reminded of the astonishing convention victory ofGeorge McGovern
just two short years ago. as proofthat a candidate can emerge from the grass rootsand
capture the nomination. His successor hopefully will not repeat his mistakes.and Will
carry a victory home to the White House:

Tightening the Belts

Whether a political bluffdirected at the American peopletocalni their raw nervesor
a sharp-edged warning. President Ford has told the Arab oil producing nations that a
continuance oftheir exorbitant prices will destroy the world's economy and send us all
into a critical depression. Even Henry Kissinger. the bastion of Arab appeasement
issued a stern warning toOPEC~ the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Speaking indirectly. but aiming obviously at the Arab nations. Kissinger said that. “It
can be in the interest of no country or group of countries to base policies on a test of
strength. for a policy of confrontation would end in disaster for all."

the President had even more stern words for the oil producers. thinly disguising a
threat to counter the use of oil as a political weapon with the use of food and
technology as an equally effective weapon. Launching his “Project Interdependence.
I’ord promised that he will take tough measures to ensure an adequate supply ofoil for
America‘s needs. emphasizing that international co-operation is‘crucial ifthe world is
to avoid plunging into aégocreeconomic depression. “The danger is clear. It is very
severe.‘ .

the President may have finally passed the point of useless rhetoric. It is painfully
obvious by now that the words of well meaning diplomats will not reverse the
dangerous patterns that were set last year. One year ago on this date. talk ofan “energy
crisis“ was the substenace ofdoomsday sayers. and the world confidently proceeded on
its course bent toward ultimate confrontation. It took a war with a small country that
most nations would prefer not exist to awaken the world to the potential of an oil
squeeze. Not long after that war started. industries across Europe shut down. un-
employment soared. and economies and governments crumbled under the pressure.
'I he NA'I'O alliance was severely tested and almost didn‘t stand the strain. At home.
the inconvenience of short gas supplies. suspicion at the burgeoning oil company
profits. and the soaring inllation that has resulted from oil prices have brought this
country closer to economic brinksmanship than at any point since World War II.

Any tough measures Ford has in mind could not come too soon. It would be far
better for Americans to tighten their collective belts now. than to face widespread
deprivation in the future.

Doublespeak: Double Standard

 

 

 

 

v e - ' " by Marsha Krassneri

Language reflects the values ol'a society. In
a sense. we are all imprisoned by language
stereotypes. I'he manner in which we speak
reflects our power/powerlessness and our
ptissivity/aggressiveness. It is evident that in
itic area of language as well as other numerous
aspects within our culture. women are placed
in a subservient. passive. powerless. and often
derogatory role.

'Ihe Queendom of (iod!

Consider the following: sportsmanship.
kingdom. mankind. freshman. brotherhood.
In each of the above. the noun is described iii
terms of masculinity. When referring to
mankind or brotherhood we are supposedly
using tlietii iii a generic sense. yet they bolli
clearly suggest the male as the dominant sex.
One does not find queeiidom.
sportswoiiiansliip. or l'reshwonien present in
our vocabulary. the same is also true of hun-
dreds ol words iti which the female counter-
part is derived from the male noun. ‘Hcir-
lleiress‘.'hero-licroiiic‘.‘dlike-diicliess'.
'seulptor-sculptress‘ and ‘poet-poetess' are
only a tew of the numerous examples. Very
olten though. the suffix ‘css‘ or ‘ette‘ conjure
tip images of frivolous. unimportant roles.
llic one exception to the male dominance in
uiir language is in the area of marriage and
divorce. Ilridcgroom. bridal shower.
bridesmaid. and bridal bouquet are only a few
of the words derived from its female root -
bride. Unfortunately. though. women play an
active part in only this arena ~- in which their
sole function is that of wife. mother and
housekeeper. In addition. a woman is referred
to as a .‘divorcee‘ while a man is 'divorccd‘.
Similarly one commonly hears of ‘John‘s
widow ' Miiry' but rarely. if ever of
'Mary‘s widower John‘. , liven after death.
women are still associated with the men in

 

 

their lives. Obviously our language IS \IlllC-
