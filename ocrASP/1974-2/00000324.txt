Napoleon Sr'mphony is essentially
a comic novel; to judge it as a serious
piece of literary fiction is to do both
it and Burgess (and perhaps even
Napoleon) a large injustice. Burgess
' presents a ﬂawed man. a conqueror
with his pants down (in many places
literally) Napoleon is seen as a “Cor-
.sican blackguard" infiltrating the

lttgherkcircles of'p‘ower. This is a far

.cry from Tolstoy‘s monumental
monolith of an emperor.

Burgess‘ humor can be obvious.
He shows Napoleon as a farcical
cuckold. the last to know of his wife's
affairs. It can also be contained in
irony. characteriration and the
clever manipulation of language. but
it is never absent. The combination
of Burgess. 'BectbOVCn and

- Educated Heart

by Mary G. Goggln. PhD.

When I read Chancellor Buyer's
article "Needed- the: Educated
Heart." in a recent issue of our
Tower Tribune. lsaid:“Whereinthe
curriculum today can students find
these values which he is recommen-
ding to them. and how can they
become sufficiently convinced of
their worth to adopt them and make
them their own?“ To me. literature
seems to hold the answer. ‘

What are these values which the
chancellor believes could satisfy the
hanger of today‘s college generation
for “truths to which serious men or
women can dedicate themselves“?
Three of the four which he suggests
are Truth. llcautyand Goodness. He
quotes Albert Einstein: “The ideals
which have lighted me on my way
and time after time given me new
courage to face life cheerfully have
been Truth. Goodness. and Bwuty."
The fourth value which Chancellor
Boyer suggests is “warmth and in-
tegrity in our human relationships."

These ideals. we should perhaps
point out. are not new. The first
three were suggested long ago by
l’lato as goals ofan ideal education.
The importance of the fourth in ad-
dition to the other three was
recognized and emphasized by
Roman philosophers such as l’an-
aetius and Cicero.

The importance of this last value
as it is revealed in the “Aeneid” ofthe
poet Virgil'camc to my mind as I
watched recently a TV mm broad-
cast prescnting scenes of the tragic
events taking place on Cyprus. We
saw a family in Nicosia fleeing from
their home because ofgravc dangers
threatening them. A small station
wagon stood in front of the house.

possessions. The mother and

Then my thoughts turned to book ll
of the “Aeneid.” with Aeneas ﬂeeing
from the tires of Troy carrying his
OWn cherished father on his
shoulders and followed closely by his
wife and son.

This Latin epic is a “work of
literature in which we find not just
one but all four ofthcsc values. They
are also present in Sophoclcs‘ “An-
tigonc.“ Dante‘s “Divine Comedy."
and Shakespeare‘s “King Lear“. At
its besl literature does not state. it
shows with wordsand forms so mov-
ing that it touches the heart.

SEPTEMBER 24, 1974

 

by Paul Pelagalll

Findlay Cockrcll. on Saturday.
September 21‘. gave a concert which
was entitled Chopin's Greatest Hits.
I expected the Recital Hall to be
packed. 'with the combination of
Cock rell llndehOPln. Yet the empty
seats in the compact hall Were
numerous. » -«

I don't think this was because of
the other things occurring on earn-
pus. There wasa performance bythe
Kathryn l’osin Dance Company.
also in the PAC. and the usual corn-
plement of movies. none which were
,very good. The Dance Company
drew well but this could not account
for the poor,tnrnout at the concert.

Perhaps it‘s because few people on
campus know about Findlay
Cockrcll. He is a professor in the
Music Department and a truly ex-
cellent pianist. Although I‘m no es-
pcrt on classical music We listened
to enough. particularly Chopin. to
know that Cockrell is a line per-
former in a technical sense. As Well
as his technical skills he has
charisma. When I saw Cockrcll for
the first time I was impressed by his
physical stature and obvious cori-
lidence.

Before he played I thought he was
a ham.

After he played I thought he was
great. The show was Wednesday.
September l8. when he played four

098 Paris   

Scherzos by Chopin. I really en»
joycd this. and wanted to see more of
the same.

On Saturday I walked into the
Recital Hall expecting a light fora
sent just as l have to do everywhere
on this campus. lblinkcd a couple of
times to make su re my contact lenses
were over my pupils. I had my
choice of seats.

Whenever I listen to classical
music I try to envision myself in the
time period and country in which the
piece “as written. At Mr. Coekrcll‘s
Saturday performance 1 sat in a bo.\
across from the stage. There I was.
in nineteenth century Paris. I was
wearing tails and my hat rested on
my lap. My companion wore a
white. llowing gown. She rcsctnbled
Marie/\ntioncltc.prc-Rcvolutionol'

The music made it easy for my
mind to wander among fanciful
thoughts such as that. The pieces
played included the Minute Waltz.
Polonaise Mililairc. and the
l’olanaise in A Hat. Thcscarc three
ol the more well known pieces but
most were familiar.

eyes glued to his hands and my

elsewhere.

Two more performances of the
satuc program were given on Sunday
and Monday. On October 9-l0
Coekrell will play some Gershwin
piano pieces and on November Ill-I4
he will perform lleethovan‘s
"Tempest" Sonata. These concerts
will be at 4:00 at the PAC If you
have never seen cla cal music live
you should make an effort to get to
sortie of these. If you don't like
classical music you might change
your mind about it.
