The football program has ccrtainly come a long way in ﬁve years.

i It was just three years ago that Hudson Valley Community College
. was a big game on the griddch schcdulc. Now Hudson Valley is ti big

You can thI that Albany‘s football program has grown up as tho
Danes made both tthcii' York Timer and the Daily Nr'it'xthc past
wcckcnd. The News still hasn‘t recognized the Danes talcntsas one ol~
thcir reporters pickcd Hol‘strzi to casin licat Albany. But what do

sports writers know anyway'.’

We will see how for Albany has rcally come when they host power-

i lul All'rcd on Saturday. Last Saturday All'rcd dcstroycd llrockport,

who happcns to be one of our toughest opponents. Saturday‘s gamc
has thc makings I'or one of thc hcst collcgc football games in thc arc;

, in yours. I know Couch Ford would Iovc to scc it big crowd at tlic

game. as atlcndttncc in thc past has bccn sparse. With the Danes
ltomc undcl'catcd strcttk of nine on thc linc. he‘s going to nccd all oi
