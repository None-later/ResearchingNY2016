To Keep Poor , '

It is getting cold in Albany. A chill has taken to the air. and the stinging
frost that has settled over the city warns of an ‘early winter.

For too many of Albany‘s residents. the unwanted approach of the season
means cold nights without heat. and sickness possibly without help. For the
poor underprivileged. there is often nowhere to turn for sufficient remedy.
For these people. the Albany area United Way istheir major source of aid.

. Again this year. the United Way. aconglomcrate charity organization giv-
ing lands to thirty two individual charitable agencies. is seeking help.
Wltcthcr they reﬂect the changing times. or those changing times have press-
cd-thcrn for more help. the United Way this year will accept the active par-
ticipation of university students.

To organizations like the Red Cross. it could be the marginal assistance of
university help that enables funds to kecpjust one cxtrafamily healthy this
winter. With homcs for the children of the disadvantaged. the addition of
students“ support could keep one more child from taking to the streets in
search for his own kind of help over the winter

United Way plans to kick off its fund-raising drive in mid-October. to run
continuously until the first or second week in November.

Senior l.cc Annc Robertstl’sychology) is coordinating the drive. As the
first studcnt to cvcr hold a position on the United Way Board of Directors.
Roberts linds hcrscll' in an cxccllcnt position to spearhead the campus drive.
Roberts has attempted to coordinate the efforts of students and faculty.

llcr most succcssl'ul efforts have been through the intersorority council.
which she hopcs will provide the backbone of the Albany drive.

the goal of the drive is. on the surface. a modest total of one thousand
dollars. Albany scrvcs as a pilot program as it is the first one to involve
sludcnts directly. The fish-bowl status of the drive. Roberts hopes. will at—
tract attention and support for thc drivc.

“llnitcd Day." the final day of tlic drivc. should be the program‘s climax.
Roberts listed thc anticipatcd cvcnls including a basketball game at the La
Sallc Acatlcm) campus. a Faculty 'l‘alcnt Show. and a dance in the Campus
