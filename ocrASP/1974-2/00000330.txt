"I warned you that rose would die.

I knew it. ‘

I saw too many sallow leaves

Happily whirl-spin to their earthly death
To know that something was not right.
The sun melted into a now frigid eItrth
so early I

It made the evening air sting my nostrils.“
Somehow ‘

In my garden

This lone themed ﬂock of beauty
Survived

Until

You left me

In night

lnlovewithyou alone.

Dead leaves danced down the street
Like we did

In the good titncs gone.

“I warned you that rose would die.“
