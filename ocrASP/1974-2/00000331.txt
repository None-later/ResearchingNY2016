alter: {or Halt ?!

by Eddie ‘the whale" Fox

“Fish” in chess jargon is an in-
dividual who makes simple mistakes
or blunders that a seasoned player
rarely makes. This lesson is geared to
assist the beginner who feels that in
order to obtain a good game he must
memorize openings 15 to 20 moves
deep.

Memoriration is important in
chess just as it is in any subject one
endeavours to learn such as math.
history. etc. But just as in math or
history certain basic principles and
formulas are necessary to solve
problems or predict future events
over the chessboard. This is where
opening theory comes into play.
More important than memorizing
move by move it is imperative to tin-
dcrstand 'the theory or the plan
behind the opening moves it one
wants to improve the quality ofoncs
play.

The opening moves are based on
definitive ideas however unclear.
l'hese ideas form the foundation
where as the mines themselves are
the construction ol the ideas. R ttcbin
l’ine tells us that chess is play with
three definite assumptions:

it White. because he has the lirst
mo\e. hasa slight advantage. Conse-
quently:

2) White‘s problem lies in securing
the better position while:

.il lilack is laced \\ith the problem
of gaining equality.

SEPTEMBER 27, 1974

'l’heory is based on what is good
practice. If it's good practice then
theory is good. in the space allotted
here it is not possible to go into the
ideas behind each and every opening
just let it suffice to say that in each
and every opening. play evolves
around the center.

Ten basic rules for the beginner or
intermediate player to follow are:
I) Open with eitltcr the King‘s Pawn
or the Queen's l’awn.

2) Wherever possible.
dc\eloping mow that
something.

3) Develop knights before bishops.
4) Move each piece to its best square
and leave it there.

5] Make no more than 2 pawn moves
in the opening.

(it Relrain lrom early development
ol the Queen.

7) Castle as soon as possible
prelernbly on the kings wing

lit l’lay lor control ol the center.
0) Maintain at least one pawn in the
center II at all ptlssihiv.
