Might I suggest that you take up
the recorder. It is very easy to play.
and a nice sounding one cttn cost all
of $3.95. The rceorderdocs not have
the beautiful sonarity ofa violin. or
the resounding power of a trumpet.
It does have a soft llute-likc sound.

What makes it so attractive is that it .

is the easiest of all instruments to
play. The sound is produced simply
by blowing air softly into the
mouthpiece and the fingerings itre
quite simple. So. it' you already
know a little about reading music.
and desire once again to play an in-
strument. why not take up the
recorder?

The recorder is one of the oldest
wind instruments. It is the ancestor
of all rnodcrtr woodwinds. including
the flute. oboe arid clarinet.
Although its iatrgc is comparitiVely
limited (2% octaves). there is quite a

bit of good rttusie written by nutrrv of

the great composers. liven today
composers are still writing music for

' the recorder.

Historically. though
the recorder was mainly a folk in-
strument.

Recorders come in various sizes:
Soprano. Alto. 'l‘enor. and Bass. A
group of recorders playing together
is called a consort. It might be men-
tioned here that much coirsort music
is available. ' At one time all
recorders were wooden. Later they
catrte in ivory aitd porcelain. Today.
with the advent of modern
technology. we have recorders made
of lturd plastic. Although the price
of these plastic recorders is cltcttp.
the sound isn‘t. lpcrsonally pcrl'er a

The recorder is once again t'csllttl‘
