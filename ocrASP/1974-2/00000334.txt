k The State Legislature. with its political nose snifﬁng out the trends before the up-
' Etcom" g‘electionf; has been rumbling about the year-old Rockefeller'Drug Law. The
' '_8lid nly‘so‘eially conscious senators and assemblymen have been considering that
‘ ' perhaps a maximum of IS yearsimprisonment for possession of an ounce of marijuana

in bit’“stifl“. Withelections less than two mo’nths'away. it is felt that adisplay of polite
~ Ii, iialrdtsquietover the law will satisfy their newly' young constituencies. or at least
pacify them until after their re-election. Nevertheless. the rumblings are surfacing now.
and a hard look atone of the most repressive piecesof legislation to ever emerge from
the State Capitol is certainly in order. -
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Hugh Carey. despite his public stand against
repeal of the drug law. at least favors its reform - most notably the provision for a one
to fifteen year sentence for possession of marijuana. Even the Republican District At-
torney of Albany. Ralph Smith. whose comments on drugs go as far as recommending
that. “As far as I‘m concerned those (drug) dealers should be strung from the nearest
Iamppost” recommends that punishment for marijuana possession and use be greatly
A relaxed. He has even suggested that possessors of small amounts of marijuana not be
prosecuted at all. '

Governor Wilson. as far as can be determined. believes that the drug law is satisfac-
tory as it now stands. It is unlikely that he Would advocate a major revision of his
predecessor‘s program should the Governor get re-elected by some fluke. Certainly.
without strong leadership. the Legislature will not takeit upon itself to revise the law.

Students have the responsibility of lobbying during the campaign for the repeal of
this law. Now. at a time when support of the law is slipping daily. and when the
pressure ofelection day is increasing as quickly. coordinated student efforts will be the
most successful. The law must be revised. and only concentrated pressure will work on
a traditionally lethargic and stubborn body of lawmakers. If the present Legislature
cannot find it within themselves to change the law. then perhaps their replacements in
November will have the nerve.

Threshold of a. Nightmare

We a re on the threshold ofan era of shortages. With the world‘s growing birth rate.
increasing life spans. and expanding desires for higher standards of living. it is becom-
ing more unlikely that technological progress will be able to keep stride. It is possible
that new discoveries await us. but signiﬁcant changes will not- be effected for twenty or
thirty years or more. and this progress will be in the face of extreme pessirnists and
cynics who foresee the end of the human race within the century.

y Faced with a bleak future. we‘ve got to carefully consider our position as a country
and as an integral part of the world. As a country. we have made great progress. but
only at the expense of enormous amounts of the earth‘s resources. We cannot look
only at our own birth rate and say that population is in a “downturn.” nor can we say
we have enough food and oil in this country to “get by“. America is capable ofjoining
forces with the Soviet Union and the rest of the West and together keeping the rest of
the world down while we continue to sucke every last drop ofoil and the smallest speck
of copper from the Third World. America is also capable of restricting itself and
suspending its own progress to help uplift the entire world and provide generous and
for'esighted leadership. To some degree. statements by statesmen such as Henry
Kissinger are promising in this respect. yet we surely lack complete direction.

Our belts are tightening. but we lose sight of the fact that most of the world can‘t even
afford belts. There are a number ofthings we can do. and the easiest among them in-
volves stopping waste. We waste oil. coal. food. paper. metal. plastic. and just about,

' everything else. Even food is wasted. especially in institutions like ours. A quick look
at the finished trays in any of the school's cafeterias tell a very sad story. Commuters
can pitch in with the pooling system being organized by I’YE (Protect Your Environ-
ment). '

We all know the things we can do to alleviate the cited problems and the many others
facing us. Maybe. we‘d really better start doing them. .

After 1' once again mechanically rejected

Iivcr since I lirst noticed this obnoxious sear

originally a subtle discomfort has grown
rapidly iitto a full-blown neurosis. Soon it
passed the point where lcotild hide it from my

Unrelated Solutions

'l'leollowr'ng is o [utter/root the Dean ofthe
School of Nursing to Mayor Corning.

Dear Mayor Corning:

I urge you to veto the pending housing or-
dinance which restricts house-sharing by tnorc
than three unrelated persons on the grounds
that it in no way resolves thedifﬁcultics which
prompted its passage but. rather. creates new
ones.

This ordinance would preclude an arrange-
ment whereby four retired school teachers
might share a house or. where families might
take in several foster children. as well as
numerous other arrangements which evolve
among people as a means of resolving
economic problems or. as often happens.
IrcaltIi-relntcd problems.

I see no relationship between blood-
rcltitcdncss ttnd noise control. In rriy
neighborhood. lor example. there isu mother—
son household where they would wake tltc
dead with their screaming at cttcb other. Nor
is there necessarily any connection bctwccu
