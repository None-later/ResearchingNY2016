 4—10:  SUNYACs v ~

by Mike Piek'arskl

Coach Bob Burlitigame says
he is “pleasantly surprised" after
the Great Dane varsity baseball
team captured its third and
fourth consecutive State Univer-
sity of New York Athletic Con-
ferece (SUNYAC) games
without a loss as they tripped
l’lattsburgh 6-2 and 3-l last
weekend.

Senior 'l‘om Blair notched ltis
second conference win of the
season as Albany took the lirst
gante of the twinhill by a four-
rtin margin. Blair struggled with
ltis controlat times btit picl.cd up
the big otits when ntost needed.
Many ol'hisninc strikeoutscame
with men on base and Ctiach
liurlingtime added. “he did a lot
of clutch pitching.“ Returning
starter Jeff Breglio was the hit-
ting star as he drove in four of the
Danes’ six runs with two coming
on a home run.

In the second game.
rightliandcr John Dollard pitch-
ed an excellent 3—hittcr as the
Dancseeked out a CH win. Paul
Nelson's two~run triple with two
down in the fourth was the game-
winning blow breaking it I-l
deadlock. Dollard and Blair now
have identical 2-0 records in con-
ference play.

Asked about the Danes‘

chances tltis season. Coach
Burlingame. declined to make
atty predictions but said Albany
would need “at least ten [vic-
tories] to win the title.“ Last year.
Albany finished third at Ill-5 btit
won the championship the
previous campaign with a Iii-2
slate. With four wins already.
litirliitgatttc remarked. “We‘re
really ahead of schedule.“

The loss of scvett starters front
last year's squad has pttt quite a
crimp iii the manager‘s plans bttt
he remains optimistic. His “two
biggest losses“ are Kevin Quinn
and Terry Kenny. Quinn was the
ace of ltist year's staff with a 7-l
won-lost record itt Conference
competition and a stiperb 0.84
ERA. Kcnity. selected on tlte
ninth round by the Suit Fran-
cisco (iiants iii the recent college
draft. was one of Albany State‘s
finest performers. The center—
ficldet'fs .453 overall batting
average set a new scltool record
last year and his throwing arm
was the object of considerable
attention from pro scouts. Both
Kcnity aitd Quinn were chosen to
the All-SUNYAC teams for the
past two seasons.

Senior Vie (iiulianclli. fourth-
year starting catclter and team
.captain. is the top player in
Burlingamc‘s appraisal of this

 

year‘s team. Vic is “holy consis-
tent and hits the ball well“. said
the manager. liurlingamc is
counting oit Giulianclli‘s pchr~
fttl bat to provide ntuch of the
scoritig punch this season.

.lcl'f lircglio. junior first-
bttseman. is the other returnittg
starter (excluding pitchers) from
last year. lireglio is "a tiittely
hitter“ according to Burlingamc
and also hits with power. He is
Albany‘s leadittg hitter so far
with a hontcr and three doubles
attd lttts accounted for two Dane
victories.

he said.

littt the surprise of the season

Enthusiasm for the Albany

State football team has started to
bttbble over on and off campus
after ltist Saturday‘s etisy victory
over liol'stra. iii anticipation of
the Danes‘ toughest challenge
ever when they ftice powerful
Alfred at home this Saturday.

Publicity has never been better
for the young football program.
The team has previously been
overshadowed by schools like
Union tiitd Rl’l. But after the
team‘s victory over Hofstra. the
local tttcdiu litis starttid to
recogni/c the Danes‘ abilities.
Suddenly the team is on the front
of the ‘I'I'Imo' Union sports page

tattcc to OJ. Simpson’s kitee on

The Alfred contest could be
the biggest collegiate footbtill

Ford. its always. remains coit-
l‘ideiit about the upeomiitg
game. “I think we can beat
Alfrcd.'|'hey are it far betterl'oot-
ball team than llofstrti. We must

so Alfred ntust really be tough.
Brockport managed only 67
yards against a stingy Alfred
defense.

Alfred is perhaps the best

Ytincvich is a veteran of 35 years

His team playsa tough punishing

big tackles and quick defensive
ends could play havoc for the
Ditties. Yunevicli‘s philosophy
on defense is to smash the
quarterback and hurt him.

the Danes will be running out
of their regular wishbone-T.
Ford plans nothing special on
offense for Alfred but will try to
exploit Alfred‘s weaknesses.
Ford feels that the team must be
able to get the ball to the outside
