reasons for hiring these people. “The
goal of this music department is to
give the students the best musiatl

that the best way ofachicvingthis is
to select a faculty which is
knowledgable in music theory and
history. and who are also first rate
performers. “It is important to per-
form the music that people learn.”
Dr. (iottschallt stated emphatically.
In keeping with this belief. numerous
student and faculty exhibitions are
schedirled. encompassing solo.
