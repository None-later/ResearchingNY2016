“To .6" inhuman”, someone

once  but to Norwich? That
was the story after Albsn‘y failed

to come up' with a win in the Sc-
cond Annuathapital District
Fan Baseball classic. held here
last weekend. Eliminated by
North Adams 4-3 in a tough
opening-round match. next day‘s
consolation game was no eon-
solation to Coach Bob
Burlingame after the Great
Danes also dropped that one to
Norwich.by an 8-6 score.

In the tirritgame. it took an ex-
tra inning to reach a decision. but
the Danes still came out on the
short end of the 4-3 score. Tom
Blair got me starting nod and
was a little shaky in the first. put-
ting runners on second and third
with one out and a 3-l count on
the North Adam's cleanttp hitter
Vgolick. But two blazing fast-
balls sent the slugger back to the
dugout. as Blair induced the next
batter to line to short and ettd the
threat.

The. Danes came through in

their half of the inning with two
qutck runs on only one hit. Paul '

Nelson started it with a one-out
walk and moved up as Blair
‘rcachcd on an error. A double-
stcal off a missed bunt. set the
stage for captain Vic
Giulianelli‘s 370-foot double off
the right-center fence which
producer! the two tallies.

But North Adams bounced
right back in the second to knot it
at 2~2. With two down.
Zukowski and Stead singled and
advanced on a Blair wild pitch
before scoring on Erving‘s line
single to center. At that point.

'botlt Blair and opposing hurler

Dave l’icrcc settled down con-
siderably. as -ach allowed only
four hits the rest of the way.

Albatty regained the lead III
the fourth,whcn Carlos Olivcras
walked. was sacrificed to second.
moved to the third on Blair‘s
base hit. and scored on a
(iittlianclli sac fly to deep right.
lint a double and single in the
Adams‘ sixth attd it was tied up

The mere fact that all the runners
at Syracuse are on scholarships
shows the severity ot'thc competition
the ﬁeld. being that they‘re all simp-
ly last. The first two miles weredonc
antler ten minutes which to anyntte
should indicate that everyone was
far I'rotn jogging.

“When I s‘oy we were moving. we
were moving.“ said Coach Mttnsey.
"The first two miles it was all Albatty
tltett Syracuse gradually cltippcd
away." Munsey‘s elation was bubbl—
ing. “We‘ve got a team. Well. that‘s

just tough. I just lclt so happy.“

()nc tltittg is obvious as Coach
Munsey explained. “We don‘t want
to shoot ottr load too early: we don‘t
want ottr ttltitnatc peak now.“ Bank-
ing on this advice. the results the
Itarricrs and their fans can look
forward to in tltc near futttre catt bc
Itotlting sltort of attta/ing.

their record when they go back into

again to face Williams at llztlll.

With one out in the Adonis
eighth. Icftfielder‘ Stefanick
slammed his second double of

the game: a one-hop shot to the r'

left-center fence to start‘the win-

ning' rally. Another wild pitch ,.

sent him to third before scoring
on a sac ﬂy by Wright. Albany
went down meekly in their half to
pin the loss on an arm—weary
Blair. The righty had a good fast
ball throughout the game and
picked up six strikeouts. but
seemed to be getting hit hard in
the last few innings.

'l'hc consolation game with
Norwich the following day
should never ltavc been played.
With rain delays of 12 and I9
minutes respectively. and both
coaches seemingly more in-
terested in seeing their sub-
stitutes in action. the Danes were
outlasted by an 8-6 score.

Coach Burlingamc gave John

ineffective. In two plus frames of
work he was charged with live
ru‘iﬁ‘ nit three hits. walking live
and fantting one. His reliever.

seemed to spark tltc Danes. The
fans. who catnc. deserve a large
share nl the credit for Albany‘s
big victory.

The Danes must now be able
to satisfy their fans. who expect
.ttt undefeated season. Some
people belieye the players may
lta\c peaked too soon. After
heating Ilot'stra and Allrcd on
sticccssiyc Saturdays. What can
tltc Danes do for an cncore‘.‘
Albany could find it difficult get-
ting up for the easy ballgamcs.

Fullback 'I'otnmie DcBlnis
doesn‘t think it will be a problem.
“We ltave alot to look forward
to. especially on the offense. We
want an undefeated season.“
Rudy Vido feels “The team will
stcatn roll through the rest nftlte
season.“ Coach Ford's solution
to motivating the tenth will be
stressing llet'tur/i's absence.

The injury to liertuzzi is the
Danes chief worry at the mo-
mettt. but Ford has always ex-
pressed confidence in Ahonen‘s
quarterbacking. In previous
scrimmages he ltas shown good
ability to lead the Dane‘s
wishbone. He certainly proved
he could throw tltc football with
his touchdown pass to Bob Bax-
tcr against Alfred. A dry field
should help him against Rl'l‘.

With hontecnming next Weﬁk.
the players expect to play in front
of an even bigger crowd. after all
the excitement they generated by
their big victory Saturday.
