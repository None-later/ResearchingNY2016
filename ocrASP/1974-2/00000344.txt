Danesloclter‘ room after the football
team defeated Alfred 7~6in their
biggest game ever. Water flowed like
champagne over the ’mud-caked
tired bodies of the phyers as there
was exuberance all over the
locker-room. V '

The players had every right to
boast as they beat one of the best
small college football tear’nsin the
East and this resulted in the Danes
being ranked second only to Ithaca
in the-weekly Lambert Bowlvoting.

The game was decided for all in-‘
tents 'and purposes on one play.
Alfred hasjust scored. leaving them
one point behind with six and a half
minutes to go. The Saxons choose to
go for a two point conversion. lfcon-
verted it would have given Alfred the
ballgatne. as Albany‘s offense .was
going nowhere.‘

Alfred quarterback Chris Kristot'f

tired the ball but Albany‘s secondary _

converged to knock the football
away from an open receiver to keep
Albany in front. When questioned
about Alfred‘s strategy Coach Ford
said “In tltat situation you must go
for the win. I would have done'the
same thing.“

It was the defense that won the
garlic for the Danes. Led by pro
prospect Rudy Vido. the defense was
spectacular. allowing Alfred only
three first downs in the second half.
They constantly bottled up the Sax-
on‘s running attack with their great
pursuit and the defense completely
shut ol'l'Allred's highly touted pass-
ing attack. The secondary was out-
standing as llilly lirown. Arnie Will
and Donnie Mion all had a fraud in
key tumble icco\cries or intercep-
tions.

Perhaps the biggest defensive hero
for the Danes was punter _ Mike
Marrin. Marrin constantly put the
Danes out of potential danger with
his punts of about forty yards.

0n the offensive side. things were
dismal. Alfred Coach Alex
Yunevich's philosophy on. how to
stop Albany‘s wishbone was simple:
get the quarterback. And that is ex-
actly what his team did. as Albany's
starting signal caller John Bertuzzi
was injured in the lat quarter. put-
ting him out of action for amonth.

That left things upto sophomore
quarterback Dave Ahonen. Facinga
tough Alfreddclcnse. Ahonen. who
had limited college experience..had a
great deal ol'trouble movingthe ball.
He fumbled the ball nine times.

“I tried'to do the best I could." said
Ahonen after the game. “1 would like
to try it on a dry day. Most of the
fumbles were caused by a pretty wet
ﬁeld and Alfred‘s tough defense."
l’crhaps inexperience and ner-
vousness must also be attributed to
some of those fumbles.

Hertuui Hurt

The game was played in a constant
pouring rain. Coach Ford described
the field's condition as “wetter than
llcll.“ Alfred won the toss and
elected to receive. This was a
questionable move because of the
poor conditions.

Alfred‘s Scott Herring received
the opening kickoff and moved up

.i Runners Stun. Army 

by George Miller

The Albany State cross-country
team has once again proved their
high caliber of running this past
weekend. by upsetting a powerful
Army squad at a triangular match
with Syracuse.

It was a tnost rewarding and
satisfying tncet for the Albany
harriers.as they have been looking
forward to facing Army with a quiet
determination ever since last year‘s
defeat. The scoring done at 2 dual
.nects showed Albany topping Army
25-32. while Syracuse came away
with all the marblcsdowning Albany
22-35 and Army 25-36.

“My God. it was a thrill. " ex-
claimed Coach Bob Munsey. “Army
takes its losses really hard. It just
floored them."

The meet was ran over a 5.2 mile
course and according to Coach
Munsey. "A very. very hard course
to run." The times were very sur-
prising however. despite the overcast
conditions and strong. gusty winds.

Army placed their two top men.

4" three year veteran Dennis 'l'rtijillo
3 and former New York State churn-
» {Lpion llob Alitw. across the line

together with a 'wlnning time. of
27:l7. Carl Dugun of Syracuse came

J

in third while Co-captains Vinnie
Reda and Carlo Cherubino ctttnc in
fourth and sixth respectively with
titncs of 27:36 and 27:49.

An indication of the im—
prcssivcness of these times is shown
by their ranking in the top 25 titncs
ever recorded over the Drumlins
(iolf Course. since its completion in
I946. '

“Vinnie Rcda with his time.ran
hitrd enough to get l5th best.“statcd
Coach Munsey while “Cherubino
ran hard enough to get the l9th best
time ever."

Very itnportant places were
grabbed for Albany by Chris Burns.
llith. with a time of 28:09. Herb
llason. l2ih. with a time of 28:3l
and freshman Steve Archer. l3th.
with a 28:55.

“It looks like an upset but the way
we ran it. it wasn't. “ said Munsey.
Supporting this claim is the almost
unbelievable fact that Albany placed
five-men ahead of Army‘s third!

"We were undressed. showered
and sleeping by the time they got
their 4th and 5th men across." laugh-
ed Coach Munsey.

Reﬂecting on the race.Munsey
said. "They Wentout like a bullet
with a 4:45 mile on a hilly.
windswept golf course. When lsaw

pack | just about lost my cookies

but they‘re still under a lot of

pressure.‘ llchind thcmwerea string
of Syracuse men and a few Army.

.Tltcy \vcrc running like they meant

it. and they did. Reda was rttnning
against this’l‘rujillo kid and it was on
the last hill that Trujillo shot ahead."
Unfortunately as Munsey
revealed. “Rcda got a little lost on
the way back. He took a wrong tttrn
and Duggan just barely beat him

out.“ However. Munsey matter of

factly stated. “Vinnie lteda ran the
best race he‘s ever run."

Albany was in striking distance of

giving Syracuse the saute medicine
as Army. but Syracuse was able to
stretch it out on the last mile. ln ae-
tuality. it was tnorc of an inching
away than a marching.

“llerh l-lason went absolutely
eraly." said Coach Munsey. “He's a
spurt runner. starting off slow and
then he does a series of crazy
accelerations. He passes a groupand
then drops hack ttnd then passes
another group. The coach up there
said. ‘(iood'Lord. you're driving my
kids nuts.‘ In this way he was con-

Council Voids SOme ElectiOns;

Central Council voted Wednesday
night to invalidate the Student
Association commuter elections.
They also voted to extend current
voting on the quadsthroughtoday.
Central Council and University
Senate seats are ttt stake in theseelcc—
tions.

In the commuter voting machine.
names were not fixed so that they
“slid back and forth.“ said Vich
President Ira Birnhaum. l'le ex-
plained “you couldn't tell who voted
for whom."

Voting was extended until Friday
on the four quads because the
machine in Colonial could not be
opened Tuesday. 1 o make up forthe
lost day. Central Council decided to
have the SA elections extended until
l‘rufay on all quads.

Along with the SA cotnmttterelcc-
tions. the class of '70 elections were
also invalidated. In class elections.
only that particular class is entitled
to vote. llowever. tlte elassclections
were held In the voting booths so
that anyone who wanted to cottld
vote. Also. on Dutch quad. voters
could not write in for the '76 elcc~

 

tions.

The SA elections on Alumni quad
were also invalidated because of
illegal cleclionccring by many oflltc
candidates. "A number of Alumni
candidates“ stood by the polls and

tn'cd to influence voters. said llirn-w

beam.

The person who, is in charge of
overseeing the elections. and making
sure everything runs smoothly is
Linda Weinstock.

Last year Linda Weinstock was

allegedly reserved 6-8 free tickets for
herself. “I can‘t see howa person like
that can be election comissioner."
said one SA official. One SA leader
called Weinstock “incompetent”
and added that “she didn‘t know
what to do.“ There was “a lack of
organization not just on her part."
said SA President l’at Curran. He
added that “no one was trained to be
election commissioner."

In other Central Council business.
the executive body debated whether
to appropriate $500 and a $1th loan
tor the November second United
Way Drive. headed by Lee Anne
Roberts.

United Way

Roberts attended the meeting in
order to expla in thcdrivc to Council.
It will be the first time in the history
ofthe United States that studentsarc

Objections were brought up that
the goal was to raise $1000 and that
SA would be giving $50Q for ex-
penses. Some felt it would be “for-
clog the student body to make a
donation."

Seycral members appeared to be
annoyed at Roberts‘ constant “I
want..." “I‘ve worked hard." and "I
don't want to be embarrassed if it
fails." When Roberts was not receiv-

Student input into the tenure-and .

promotion process on New York
State campuses may be seriously
diminished as‘a result of the latest
two year agreement between the
state and university professionals.
However. th_ere is varied opinion as
to the extent of the erosion.

A primary'reason tor the different
interpretations now being argued is
the wording of'the pact. The contract
clearly states that. “academic review
shall mean a review and recommen-
dation by a committee of academic
employees...“ It does not explicitly

-dcny students the right to participate
in the evaluation and discussion
processes precccding a decision. The
accord does however prohibit their

V0165 front being included with facul-
ty votes. thus limiting students to ad-
visory status only.

Patricia Buchttltcr. director of
Strident Activities recently resigned
her position as president of the
Albany chapter of the United Un-
iversity Professionals. She admits
that her resignation was a personal
decision stemming from a conviction
that she could not simultaneously
be an “advocate of student
positions“ and president of a union
chapter.

Ms. lhtchalter. who participated

ing full-attention from Council. she
stood up nearly a half-dozen times
and said. “Listen to me. I'm talking.
You want to know where the money
is going.“

After discussion. the bill passed It)
in favor. 3 against. and 3 abstained.
When Miss Roberts departed. l’at
Curran expressed hisdisapproval of
Council's behavior towards her and
other people he brings ill. Couri-
cilman Lew Barr replied that Cttrran
“should consider a little tnore than a
nice pair of legs“ before he brings
people before Council.

Executive Board,

The major issues under Part
Curran‘s President‘s Report were
that the l-SA Executive lioard-
Michael Ii. Meyer. .Icft Sherman.
Len Barr. lra llirnhaum. Allan
Spintck. and Howie Grossman had
been approved; them will be a lor-
utation of an Inter-Quad Council to
have the quads work together and to
advocate their interests to SA: and
that there will again he segregated

l‘our bills that were introduced by
Finance Committee passed. A $500
supplemental appropriation was
pointed to thchlbauy State Cinema
so that they could loner their prices
to ﬁlm for tax card holders. The
fable Tennis Club and ltulittn-
American Alliance were given
budgets of $25. Chess Club was ap-
propriated a supplemental $05.

Chairperson Coyue ended the
meeting by announcing that Council
would have different guest speakers.
including E. Norbert Zahm and
possibly Mayor Coming. to com-
ment on various issues.

 

   

idthe negotiations with the state.
related how thefstudents were ex-
cluded from the process. ,

“The union doesn‘t represent
students. It does-not pretend to.
When the negotiators met with the
union representatives there were a
couple of back-to-the-wall issues.
The union was inflexible on two
issues: salary schedule and job
security.“ She continued. “Albany is
atypich ‘in regard to student par-
ticipation on these committees.
Generally it is encouraged. At the
negotiations however job 'security
was a major issue. And a majority of
the negotiators were adatnant
against student participation."

Bucltalter noted that since most
campuses had little student input
anyway. the intention may not have
been to eliminate student input. She
argues that more likely. the target
was administrators. who like
students are excluded from voting.
Still. she admits that the effect is
clean “They (students) no longer
have the vote.“

The former union president now
urges students to prepare for the
next contract in two years. "Takead-
vantage of the two years. Make sure
that there remains a real input. lfyou
(students) think these things are
wrong. now is the time to prepare.
Now you must build the bridges to
change the direction." ‘

ltuchaltcr‘s successor is 13mm:
Marsh. chairperson of the Universi-
ty Senate‘sCoucil on Promotion and
Continuing Appointment (CPCA).
Dr. Marsh has consistently defended
student input into tenure and
promotion considerations and now
is chapter president ol'aunionthat hs
in effect wiped out student votes
from certain levels of review.

Dr. Marsh admits little ofthecon-
flict of his predecessor. He notes that
students on his council will remain
members and the final votes on
recommendations will be separated
into faculty and student categories.

In order to comply with the ttnion
contract and at the same time ac-
contodatc students. Dr. Marsh said
that Cl’CA will now be an advisory
committee to the ttlrcsidcm and the
votes may be open lll meetings. in-
stead of secret ballotsas they were in
the past.

He argues. “Students : influence -
votes. Their suggestions are listened ’ s _
to on committees and they ‘havef
often influenced faculty members .t
with their verbal arguments." He

went on to note that in addition to
the direct input on the committees.
student evaluations are a vital aspect
of the decision making process.

Someone who agrees with
Chairperson Marsh is Phillip
Sirotkin. The Vice-President of

. Academic Affairs admits that it is

rare that he finds himself. “on the

‘ so me side oftltc fence with students."

As an administrator Sirotkin is also
excluded from voting. '

"This doesn‘t eliminate studenl
participation. I suppose if one wants
to exclude students one can try to
make a case httt students still will be
influential.“ Vice-President Sirotkin
has informed departments that they
are not to interpret the contract asa
signal to remove students. A notice
to departments reads. “...'l'hc
department or school shall provide
for its regular consultation with
students and others in such a way“
that will comply with the union
agreement. He also informed the
Deans of this university that there is
to be no diminution of student in-
volvetnent.

Sirotkin does admit that the
agreement has produced a “tough
line to walk on". However he argues
that in the last analysis students will
ltave considerable impact. “it is not
the numbers that make the
difference. It isthequalityol’input.“

Many students do not agree with
this view. They see the agreement
reached between the State and the
Union as a clear sign that they are
not to be included in these
procedures. Students Association
President l’at Curran summed up
their sentiments. “We are told that
we still have influence. We don't
have the vote. I wonder how they

'would feel if the Albany campus was

told by the otltcr campus chapters
that Albany could not vote but you
could talk and be influential. What
may he a bargain for the union is a
raw deal for us “
