Community-University Day is a
one day marathon which aims at
briitging the school and the local
community closer together. The
tltird annual C-U Day is Saturday,
October 5.

Latelythe University and the coin-
tnttniiy have been experiencing
tnany differences. C-U Day is ttot
designed to help solve politicttl
problems directly. On the contrary,
as explained by Sorrell Chesin. the
coordinator. it is hoped that com-
tnott interests will be expressed
rather titan loo-ti Albany social
issues. which tend to divide the Un-
iversity and community. Problems

Highlighted Tomorrow

Intve not been met in theipa'st and are
1101 anticipated this year.

This day allows the community an
opportunity to see the University in
its workings. Dr. Chesin deﬁnes the
aim of Community-University Day
as imparting an overwhelmingly
positive experience on the comintt 11i-
ty. with regard to the impact of the
University. the role of education as
an institution. ttnd the importance of
students as a group. particularly in
tlteAlbanycontmunity. Theinterae-
tion between the community 11nd
University is the dominant theme of
the day.

Dr. Chesin. serving as the over-all
coordinator. volunteered for this
position three years ago and has
assumed the role ever since. He is
supported this year by Dr. Schmidt.
as program chairman. Mr. Vati-
Dyke. chairman for publicity.
Attdrey Seidman and RalphBeisler.
as co-chairpersons oi' the services
subcommittee ttttd many others in
organiring this event. They have met
with mttclt cooperation from
tnenthcts of both the community and
the University. Most ol‘thc services
and equipment needed has been
volunteered by various members of
the University. ’ '

Serving as oneofthe few Universi-
ty campus-wide opportunities to im-
prove relations beIWecn thc coni-
muttity attd the University. Dr.
Chesin expressed that. “the Open
House garners support from all Un-
iversity members: students. faculty.
and stall. joined together to host the
public. Being a public university. it
is our obligation. responsibility. and
commitment to reach out to the
community.“

The community reciprocates by
sttppnl‘lliiig'ﬁl‘lNYA._ ln‘areas such
as Community-Service and Iocaljob
opportunities. the community. In

turn, reaches outﬁto the University.
