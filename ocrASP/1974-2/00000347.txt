In another study the National Cancer institute con
may be less susceptible to cancer than meat eaters.

Toset a proper control the institute compared the cancer rate among non
drinking. non-smoking Mormons with that among non»drinking. non-
smoking and non-meat-eating Seventh Day Adventists. Preliminary cori-
ciusions ot' the five year study are that meat-eating Mormons have twice the
cancer rate of the vegetarian Adventists.
