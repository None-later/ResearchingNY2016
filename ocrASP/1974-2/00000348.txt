’the Division or Crillege submitted an undeserved and uncomplimen'taryletter of
recommendationto the CPCA. There were many cases. usually involvihgzprt'gl'essors  «
whose studentsl'ratings were the highest and whose respect among the‘l'aculty was

found themselves the object of unwarranted attacks on their reputations and dismissal
of their services: The result of the union contract will mean that any decision reached

by the faculty will have that much less teeth in it without student input.

To be sure. the administration isn‘t given the power to vote on tenure recommen-
dations either. but this provision makes the contract that much more dangerous to
faculty. It will enable administrators whose dedication to the higher principles of
education. is questionable. at best. to excuse themselves from their own actions. Thus.
should another Carolyn Waterman .case come up again this year. Dean Richard Ken-

dall will have the perfect excuse to exert a defer-Io veto of any faculty committee deci-

sion.

SUNYA faculty ‘should be highly commended for their progressive stance on this
issue. ﬁghting the proposal from its inception. It is truly unfortunate that we are the
only university to beneﬁt from their insight into true matters of academic concern. The
contract is binding on this university for two years. During this time. close faculty-
student interaction will be crucial ilZwe are to preserve any measure of excellence in

teaching.

Albany will once again be the colossal ﬁsh bowl that all the gaping town residents

this university can only dmm of: a clean. patched, paved. repaired campus that one
would never suspect was inhabited by social human beings. ForCo mmunityl-
University Day. the students should shut themselves in. protected within the confines
of their rooms. so as not to despoil the perfection that the Administration is trying to
shove down the throats of unsuspecting visitors who have no way of knowing any
better. A student appearing outside on C-U Day will be an alien in his own home. We
do not belong here on Saturday. The displays. the student / mannequins, the pageantry
and pomp is all that C-U Day means. If we want to present to the outside community a
true picture of the monolith that takes such a large biteof their taxes. let them come any

Passing off Community-University Day as an example of how this college is run is a
gross insult to the sensibilities of anyone who sees this mockery for what it is. If it takes’
it Community-University Day to make essential repairs. to get the Administration out
their ivory towers and onto the campus with the rest of the population. then

Community-University Day should be a daily occurrence.

Fore Opponent Takes Favors

 

WASHINGTON The Forked-Tongue-of-
the~chk Award goes to one of the most
vociferous opponents ofair fare discounts for
youths. the elderly and the handicapped Civil
Aeronautics Board Chairman Robert D.
'i'imm.

'l'imm and his wife. it Was learned last week.
accepted favors from live largeairlincs on a re-
cent lour—wcek junket to Europe. and also
took a three-day Bermuda vacation courtcst
of United Aircraft Corporation.

Apparently. 'l'imm feels it is perf‘cctlyucccp-
table for high-salaried federal ofﬁcials to
accept favors. but that filling half-cmptyjum-
bo jets by permitting young people and others
to fly at reduced rates is. in his words.
“discriminatory".

I say “apparently” because 'l‘imm. whose
government salary is 340.000. has no comment
when I called his office to discuss these latest
charges by House Commerce Committee
Chairman Marley 0. Sluggers (D-W. Va.).

Of course. any way you cut it. it's wrong for
government ofﬁcials to accept gifts from the
very industries they regulate. But it takes
remarkable gall to accept those gifts. and in
the same breath tell the young and the old.
most of whom cannot afford to fly at full fare.
thin they shouldn‘t benelil from discount
at es.

In the first place. a majority of the Senate
has already approved discount litre legislas

introduced similar bills hill of” which are '

currently bogged down in the Subcommittee
on Transportation and Aeronautics). The
reasons for this groundswell of support are
many. but among the most persuasive it that it
simply doesn't matte sense in this time of

The Lost Soul

l was brought into this world.
On a dreary February Day.
And before i got to know her.
My mother went away.
So who was to take care of me?
The lost soul!
My father wasn‘t no good.
He said. “I would if i could."
llut like I said he wasn‘t no good.
So I was still.
The lost soul!
llut I. the lost soul lived on.
Willi the hpr of my grandmother
tlcur. .
Who when l was frightened would
hold the near.
Anti say. ‘llush child. ain‘t notliin
wrong."
And hum those genllc songs.
And be praying all the long.
l-or God to make it way.
for this child who was born.

Who said. “Hi do the best I can.“
For you and your son.
Until my life is done.
this may sound like the happy cn-
ding.

You see. they sent for mt: to come to
New York City.
Which was like stabbing me with a
king si/cd knife.
Ilccuusc all New York City has done
for me.
Is help me corrupt my life.
Other people saw it coming.
llut l was just too blind to see.
What the things i was doing.
Wcrc slowly doing to me.

begged me to do right.
She‘d say. “Watch who you hangout

And don‘t stay otit solatcutnight."
