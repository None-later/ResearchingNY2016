oym. Yiount. and
s a tiny, island-in the
1 Northern cycladeo group. It is sur-
’ nd , by four larger islands: Kea
to the west. Andros to'tbe north.
. Tinos to. the east and Syros to the
south. Its triangular coastline is
sleep, in most places and provides no
goodbarbors. The rocky soil sup~
ports no vegetation other than
olcander bushes and brushwood.
There is almost no writer at all. Only
on the east side can one ﬁnd a little
soil, a tiny spring. and a small stretch
of beach. All in all.Gyaros is so un-
pleasant and insigniﬁcant that
tourist guidebooks do not even men~
lion it.

Nevertheless. the island has an in-
teresting history. Theophmstus. a
student "of Aristotle. and Varro. a
contemporary of Julius Caesar. as
cited in Pliny and Elder‘s “Natural
History." both report that at one
titne the inhabitants of Gyaro's were
driven outby rats. Aratus. a Greek
author of the third century B.C..

calls the island "worthless." Cicero 

saw it in .luly of5| Ii.C. but offers no
descriptive comment. Both Vergil
and Ovid mention it in passing. The
geographer Strabo saw there shortly
after 3i li.C. a small and terribly
poor village of fishermen. .
Uyaros served the Roman Empire ‘
as a place of exile for condemned
criminals. In 22 A.I). a certain
Silanus. former governor of the
Roman province of Asia. was ac-
cused of extortion and narrowly es-
,caped exile on (iyaros. Similarly in
24 A.l).a man named Scretius was
spared exile on Gyaros; on the latter
occasion the emperor _Tiberius
remarked that there was no water on
the island. Both ineidentsare record-
ed in the “Annals” of Tacitus._'l;he
satirist .luvenal. complaining about
the corruption of Roman society.

Back in I966. the Nitty Gritty Dirt
Band started playing at the Paradox
Club in Orange City. They were
basicallya jug band at the time. This
original group was made up of
Jackson Browne. Bruce Kunkel.ztnd
Ralph Barr. and they cut an album
for Liberty records in I966. The
group was upset with the way Liber-
ty handled the recording and they
never recorded for them again. The
album was fairly successful though
and one sortg irt particulrtr.“lluy For
Me The Rain". was moved ittto tltc
"hit" category.

their peak in I97! with “Mr. Bo-

Their reviews have been mostly
favorable. It is felt by many critics
that they put on an enjoyable and
entertaining show. ~They not only

performers. They seem to hrtve

Until recently. cotintry'music had V

a small audience which centered
around the Nashville. Tennesee area.
Gradually it gained national accep-
tance and widespread radio play.
Now many bands makea living play-
ing country music. Many ofthe old
tunes are still popular while new and
original material is constantly being
produced by young writers.
Despite the fact that the new
music is similar to the old. the
different generations of country
musicians have only their music in
common. Most of the older
musicians come from the South
wltilc theyounger come from all over
the country. Southern conservatism
is seen in the musicians who are
reponsiblc forcotlntry music'sinitirtl
success. wltile the new bands have
values which might be distasteful to
some middle-aged people.
. For tltesc reasons cottntry music
has had two separate entities: The

the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (which is
made up or Jimmy Fudden. .lohn
Mcliuen. .lint lbbotson. Jeff Hanna
arid Lcs 'l'hompson) along with the
multitude of country musicians who
came in for the sessions.

The Dirt lland. which has tried
everything from country to hard
rock. are very proficient musicians
who sound just as good with
acoustic instruments as they do with
electrically amplified equipment.
This isrwhat made the whole thing
work. Only acoustic instruments
were used because the older
musicians would have it no other
way. The Dirt liand was ttware of
this. Actrff and tllclrest were im-
pressed by the ttdcptness of the Dirt
Band regarding production techni-
ques. .

()ncc mutual respect for tire
ribrliticsol botlt factions was cs-
tahlisltcd. the slag: “as set for what
turned out to be great music. Most
of the songs were written by A.|’.
Carter. the late ltusbruttl of
Muyhcllc. lioth were part of the
singing Curler Family. A few Hank
Williams songs are on the album.
which is expected of a collection of
great country songs. Iiarl Scruggs
plays "Earl‘s llrcrrktlown“ with the
Dirt liattdbackingatid he plays the
traditional "Soltlier‘s.loy"'uithhau-
joist Meliucn. Vi ar ('lerttcnts
plays a lanluslie \ctstou of "Orange
lilossom Special". All of tire older
musicians solo with the Dirt llrtnd
and the others playing behind them.
In a way the Dirt litutd is set in the
background somewhat bill it isottly
right that they stepped back a bit so
the talent they had accumulated
uould shine.

A precedent was set by this corn-
hittatlon of the old and the new. The
liurl Scruggs Revue. which consists
of Earl and three of his sorts. has
become very poptrlur recently.
Vassar Clements has recorded ‘4 ith
the (irateful Dead and Dicky llctts.
liyrott llerline. tltrce limes national
fiddle champ. has played with the
Rolling Stones and the Flying
Iiurrito Brothers. Witch Johnny

The Dirt Ilrmd. ct of have proved
that music ttlwrlys borrows from
what has come before. New ideusare
never so revolutionary that they are
not. in some ways. based on old can-
ceptions. They also made it evident
that music can transcend such
barriers as regional. moral and
generational differences. And aside
from all this. they put out six rideto
great country music. 1
