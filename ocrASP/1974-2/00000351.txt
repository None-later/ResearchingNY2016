a better life. and‘New York had a

An etthlblt of tits 'work Is In the Art cattery.

A Celebration in Mime

by Pam Burri

l'heater Council has something very special in store
for SlINYA arid the surrounding community. October
9-! l. Performing and giving workshops in a three day
residence will be tltc Celebration Mime 'l'hcntcr. from
Portland. Maine. 'I lie trottpc has art excellent reputation
and people of all ages who have seen tltcm perform were
enthralled by their ability to work logctlterand the utter
bcattty of their art.

Mime is man‘s most artcicrtt dramatic form. yet it is
one of the least known for the modern audience. It is as
old as civili/ation. yet is still preserved by actors like
tony Montanaro and his Celebration Mintc Theater.
these actors and actresses have spent their liveslcarning
to imitate lite. Though the art has always been silent. it
nottc the less speaks to us through its vitality. It has come
to include aspects of comedy. drama. acrobatics. and
dance.

lony Montanaro is tltc director of this troupe. “is
assistant is llccny Reehl. ()rtc review says of him: Mort-
tnmrro is more than a skilled performer. He is a leuclter.
...a|so a wry litte originator of material." (The ll’lrig
Slum/art]. Kingston Ontario) Another report out of the
flame .S'nrnltrr 'l'c/t'grmrr says "He is an enthusiast as well
as a faultless craftsman. qualities which have broken

through the I‘L‘sc‘l‘lcof many Marne audiences." It seems
from reading various critics tltl’litt.‘ CMTthrtt theirjoy in
the work alone is enough to captivate any audience.

the troupe of seven mctt and two women will perfortn
“An American Collage“ and other works here in the Pet-
forming Arts Center and give workshops irt tltc after-
noons. Wednesday through Friday. One of these
workshops will be open to the pttblic. the other two will v
be limited to SUNYA students ttrtd faculty. All
workshops are free. however the si/c ofthe classes will be
limited irt order to make them as rewarding as possible
for the participants. Sign-up sheets will be posted in the
Performing Arts Center on the second floor between the
Lab 'l'ltcater and the 'l'hcalcr Office. Performance
tickets will be on sale iii .the box office arid the week
before the performance in tire CC lobby for: 53.0” for
non-students. $2.00 student artd SLUO with Student
Association taxcard. The performance is being funded
by the Student Association.

the Celebration Mime 'l'lteatcr should be art exciting
experience for all who attend. The troupe will perform
and demonstrate their art with all the enthusiasm they
cart muster. and no doubt they will let a lot of that joy
spill over for us irt the audience. 'I'hcnter council urges
you to come and share in this celebration in tltcatcr.
