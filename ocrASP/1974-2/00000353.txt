_ Political Irony

with irony. Today while Richard Nixon lies in

~. 3 hospital bed. hislife at its nadir. the political

fortunes of Ramsey Clark are on the rise.

; Clark is the Democratic candidate for Senator

for the state of New. York. Decency and in-
tegrity - qualities alien to politics as practiced
by Richard Nixon - are the hallmarks of the
Clark campaign. The voters of New York
State are receptive to Clark‘s brand of politics,
as evidenced by his smashing primary victory
three weeks ago.

The people of New York and the nation
want a marked change in the poet-Watergate
style of politics. Politicians must respond con-
vincingly and decﬁtively to the abuses of

Watergate. In I974the1voters will seek a new ‘

breed of candidates; the public will favor
‘ ofﬁce-seekers who are not linked to big
‘ money, big business. or special interest
 groups.

Ramsey Clark, in acknowledging the voters' =

, concem'with the evils exposed byWatergate,
has stipulated that hiscamnaian contributions

The Javits campaign promises to be a
lavish, well financed affair, he already has,
amassed a colossal campaign treasure chest.
Javits has solicited contributions from all
segments of the business world. Banking. real ’
estate, and insurance interests have all
donated heavily to the Javits campaign. These
people will not give $100 or $200 but

Some have bought into the Javits campaign
for S l00.000. This should not surprise people,
because in his other three campaigns, Jacob

business world. Despite disclaimers by Javits
and his supporters. those large checks do
affect and sway the performance ofan office
holder; it would be futuous of us to think
otherwise.

While in the senate Javits has often been
slow to act on the major issues. He supported
us, policy in Vietnam well into the 1960‘s.
switching his position when it beciimethe pop-
ular thing to do. Javits waited a long time
before calling for Mr. Nixon to resign; even

the troglodytic Ja'mes Buckley called for Nix-t

on's resignation before Javits.

There is more to the Clark campaign than
just a SIM limit on contributions. Clark‘s
record in government is enviable. His years at

   

the Justice Department were noteworthy for
many accomplishments. in such areas as civil

rights, prison_rcform. and civil liberties. Clark "

was at the forefront of change. In addition. he
was a leader in anti-trust enforcement. cur-
tailing the mergcr activity of such industry
titans as IBM and HT.

A Bad Year for thePundlts?

The pundits say Clark has no chance of
defeating Jacob Javits, one of the most for-
mldable vote getters in the history of New
York State. But. in a tumultuous year such as
this, one in which both the President and Vice-
l’resident have been driven from ofﬁce,
anything is possible. As Senator .I. William
Fullbright can tell you, it is a bad year for in-
cumbents.
