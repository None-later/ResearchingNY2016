Collegiates at New Paltz. October 4 through 6. Albany will be sending their
two excellent singles players. Louise Covitt and Terri Kcrmun. Louise and
'fcrri are established veterans and should do well.

The strong doubles team of Pat l’odgorski and Dorri ilurrc should beuhle
to intimidate their opponentsund win the title. lionnic Ruwitzand freshman
