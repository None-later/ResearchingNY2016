starting assignment in a Great Dane
uniform. »

Coach Bob Ford has always ex-
pressed a great deal of confidence in
his young quarterback. “I think
Dave has looked ﬁne in two scrim-
magcs and in practice. The Alfred
situation was tough because of the
weather, so I can't .fault his perfor-
mance." Ford was referring to
Ahoncn‘s problem of fumbling and
inability to move the ball. On a dry
licld 'liord feels that Ahoncn will be
able to do a good job.

John Bertuzzi. the regular
quarterback, suffered a dislocated
left thumb in last week's 7-6 victory
over Alfred. The preliminary
medical report revealed tltat John
would be inactive for three weeks.
However. Bertuzzi has been working
out all weekand feels he can be ready
tomorrow. Coach Ford does not
want to rush the situation, so he will
go with Ahonen.

ltl'f and Albany httve met four
times in the past with the Great
Danes holding a 3-l advantage.'l'he
game last year at Rochester ended in

a l9-0 Albany victory. Coach Ford
calls this “an intense rivalry with

each game a physical test for both

squads."

On the season. RIT is 0-2 with
defeats at the hands of Hobart and
St. Lawrence. This RIT team is prac-
tically the same one that faced the
Danes last season, with the excep-
tion of a new head coach.

Coach Ford feels that RIT has a
very strong defensive line which will
put pressure on his offensive
linemen. l’aul lsbell at middle guard
is a standout for the Rl'l‘ defense.
Ford stated. "Rl'l‘ is as big defensive-
ly as Alfred. We must use our speed
to compensate for the weight we are
giving away." Ford hopes that the
Dane offense can move the ball to
the outside and control the Rl‘l'
defensive line.

On offense, the RIT line is very
young which will aid the Great
Danes. The inexperience of the RIT
offense should make matters easier
for the awesome Dane defense. This
is a defensive squad that held
Hofstra and Alfred to a mere thir-
teen points.

The Danes will be without the ser-
viccs of 'Jim Holloway. the litre
defensive lineman, who is out with a
shoulder injury. Coach Ford must

Munsey Happy

Afterwards Coach Munsey felt.
“They looked awfully, awfully good.
They ran a very relaxed race with no
real pressure. I think they surprised
themselves with rather fantastic
times.“

The weather couldn't help btrt
have a hampering effect on the
runners as a strong wind. which has
become a trademark of the SUNYA
campus, once again was up to its old
tricks. According to Coach Mu'nsey.
“It was good running temperature-
wise; the problem was the wind. It
was a real bitter wind.“

Regardless. it‘s apparent the learn.
as a whole. is continuing to prrt otrt
more in each meet then the
preceeding one. This trend is what
Munsey‘s been looking for.

As he says. “We‘ve reached that
higher plane of running; I do think
we are about there. You couldn‘task
for much better in Ocl’fmmuncci

for good weather tomorrow. The
rain last week made field conditions
dangerous for the players. Coach
Ford remarked that. “Our kids are
not taking RIT lightly. the team
morale was high at all our practices.“

Albany State is currently ranked
number two in the Lambert Bowl.

we're just continuing to run well."

Another surprising fact that
makes the win look even more im-
pressive is that Chris Bumsand Her-
bie Hason. State‘s number three and
four runnersdid not compete. Burns
stayed out due to a leg injury and
Hason was rested. -

Albany‘s freshman crop looks
very strong this year, as they helped
place the first seven men in the all
time top 50 times for Albanyrunners
here.

“This is really nice to see.“ stated
Coach Munsey. “They were rtrnning
without having to run.“

Face Williams

Tomorrow the barriers will haven

"little more to worry about. as they

face it definitely stronger Williams
team.

“We‘re looking forward to a little
more CIHINCHBC." said Coach
Munsey. “[f we do ottr drrty and
don't horse around - we gave
Syracuse a hattleand knocked Array
out of there - I don‘t think Williams
will handle us. brtt you never know.“

Admittedly. the competition will
be tougher bill that should make the
rttnning proportionally better. As
Coach Munsey says. “This team is
far ahead of any team we‘vccVer had
at this time of year."

Alton smllr will appeal his felony conviction sometime in December.

by Richard Nordwlnd

Almost one year after his arrest.
the controversy and legal manuever-
ing over the Alton Smith ease con-

tinues unabated. The Alton Smith

Itory epitomilcs the tensions
between the black community and
the Albany Police.as well asdistrust
between the University and the
Police.

On Nov. l I973, Alton Smith was
charged with 7 counts of felonies.
following a violent altercation with
two police officers. and the acciden-
tal shooting of a bystander. The in-
dictments were for lst and 2nd
degree assault and reckless cn-
dangerment.

Smith. a black Albany State un-
dergradrtate art major. had wounded
another State student. Miclnrel
Greggo. during the incident. Greggo
was not seriously wounded in the
shooting.

Only two facts about the Nov. l
incident are agreed upon by Smith
and the Police. One is that it took
place on Delaware Ave.. near the
Delaware Movie Theatre. at little
before It) I’. M. Secondly. both sides
concur that Smith was near his car

SA Lists lnvalidated Elections;
Some Council And Senate Totals In

by Nancy Albauglt

The results of several Student
Association elections are now of-
ficial: the rest of the elections Were
invalidated by SA President l’at
Crrrran.

l’rom lndian Quad. Maureen
De Maio won a seat on Central
Council. Roberta llarwitt won the
State Quad Council sent. and the
two Colonial seats went to Arthur
Levine and Linda Shore.

The results of the Council for the
Class of ‘76 will be released pending
the rerun of the commuter election.
The votes from the five quads were
not invalidated.

All the commuter elections (for 2
Council seats. a University Senate
seat. and the ‘76 Council) were in-
validated because. according to
Curran. the names slipped on the
machine so that when a person press-
ed a lever, he had nowayot'knowing
whose name he was programming
into the machine.

the elections for 2 Central Court-
cil seats and one University Senate
seat on Dutch Quad were in-
validated. said Currun. because the
machine was not working properly
and there was no space provided for
write-iii votes.

“16 Alumni Quad returns for 2
Central Council seats were irr-
validated becuuse one of the can—
didates was a pollsittcr. said Cttrran.
lra llirnbaum. SA Vice President.
declined to give the candidate‘s
name. saying. "He's still rrrnning.
and it might not be fair."

' Curran said that the elections will
all be condttctcd by paper ballot this
titne. they will not reopen
nominations.

Said Central Council Chairperson
David Coytrc. “I'ut tried to in-
validate as few of the elections as
possible. There was a lot of titnc and
money spent already. and he wanted
to save as much as he could."

Linda Wcinstock. President ol'the
Class of ‘75. is election corn-
rnisrioncr. Curran str d that the
confusion during the elections was

not entirely her fault. “We.need_ed
somebody. and she said she'd ltelp
out.“ llirnbaum added. "We all
should have educated her more."
Linda Weinstock in response to
recent charges of “incompetence”

said. “l can‘t see any justification of

it for me. 1 was under the impression
that I would be helped.“ She further
qualified her statements by saying.
"One person having all that respon-
sibility is ridiculous - that is. unless
that is the only thing they're involved
with. I‘m President ofthc Classof‘75
and Freshman class guardian as
well."

llirnbaum looks ahead to next
week‘s elections with a little more
hope. "We'rc too inexperienced at
this business to know perfectly what
we‘re doing. I expect that there will
probably be a couple of tninor flaws.
llowever. we've learned from ex-
perience. and Idoubt that we'll make
the major mistakes we made last
week."

Last Wednesday night. Council
repealed an election law that had
been passed by last year‘s Council.
llirnbaum alleges that before the law
was scratched [root the books. it was
violated several times. According to
the law. candidates for elected
SA positions must attend a meeting
to brief them for their respon-
sibilities if elected. This meeting is
supposed to beheld one Week before
the election. llut the meeting for
these recent elections was held two
days before the election was to he
held. Not all ofthe candidates were
notified of their obligation tocornc.

As well. the law stated that the SA
President, Vice-President. Central
Council Chairperson. and Vice-
Chairperson were to attend. Veep
lra llirnbaum was the only one from
SA who went.

Coyne said. "i don't think anyone
would deny that the bill was
violated. It‘s just that no charges
have been brought up as yet.“

when the trouble began. From this
point the two stories are radically
different.

“Alton was just checking out his
car. when two men called down the
street to him. ‘Hey nigger! Hey
coonl." says Smith‘s lawyer Mike
Feit. Only later. Feit states. was
Smith to discover that the two men
were policemen. The two cops. later
identified as Ofﬁcer Manion and
Dectective Tobin never presented
Smith with identification. claims
Feit.

According to Smith. the two men
grabbed him. and began beating him
for no reason. Feit recotrnts. “Alton
was down on the ground yelling for
the police to help."

A gun from the holster of one of
the policemen fell to the ground dur-
ing the fight. and Smith was able to
grab it.

“All Alton wanted to do was to
fire the gun in the air for attention.
He thought he was a dead man other
wise." believes Feit. Instead of firing
in the air the grin went off on street
level. wounding Michael Greggo
who had been sitting in a car one
block away. (ircggo had not known
about the altercation.

l’olice units in the area helped to
subdue Smith. and placed him under
arrest. Feit claims that Smith had
severe head injuries from his struggle
with the police. “which weren't
properly treated until days later.“

Smith was charged with several
counts of lst and 2nd Degree
Assrtalt. llail. set at $20.000. was
raised with the help of the NAACP,
and the Union Settlementv.

Smith took two lie detector tests;
one in mid-November arid the other
in May. Each confirmed his
testimony.

The District Attorney's office re-
jects Smith‘s assertation that he was

the victim of blatant police brutality. ..

Smith “suspicious”

“The two policemen were on a
prostitution stake-out when they
saw a black male. later identified as
Alton Smith. acting suspiciously“.
says Steve Coffey. prosecuting at-
torney in the Smith case.

The policemen. Coffey argues. im-
mediately identitied themselves to
Stnith. so as to ask some routine
questions. Alton Smith, Coffey
states. threw the first punches at the
policemen. and “fought like a mad
bull" before he was arrested.

Nor did the District Attorney‘s of-
fice believe Smith‘s version of the
shooting incident. “The policemen
thought that Smith was pointing the
grin right up in at them. not up in the
air.“ says Coffey. And Coffey further
claims that it took a number of
policemen to subdue Smith after his
ttrrest. “This was trot the actions of a
tuna who had just been severely
beaten."

The trial did not begin until July.
I974. It lasted five days. was well
covered by the local media. and well
attended by members of the black.
and University community. In his
three years trt SUNYA Smith had
built up an excellent reputation for
his art work. and academic
achievements. and many in the Un-
lversity came to support Smith. and
offer character witness in his
defense.

 imithCiontrOV’ersy Continues Unabate

The trial centered around three
main argucments: Did the“ police
offer identification to Smith?. did
witnesses on DelaWare Ave. actually
see Smith being beaten? was the
testimony of either Smith. or Ofﬁcer
Munich. and Detective Topin incon-
sistent with previous testimony given
to the grand jury?

The jury. confused by the exact
meaning of the seven indictments.
repeatedly asked presiding Judge
John Clyne for instructions. After
long deliberation the jury cleared
Smith of all lst Degree assault
charges. but found him guilty of two
counts of 2nd degree assault. In
other words. thejury did not believe
that Smith had attacked the officers.
but they did find Smith guilty of
resisting the policemen‘s perfor-
malice of duty.

Defense scores C lyric

After the trial. one of the jurors.
Louis A. lessicr said the jurors in-
correctly thought they could find
Smith guilty of resisting arrest even
though that charge was not part of
the indictment. Another juror.
William Straney. regretted he had
not “held out“ for an innocent \cr-
diet on all courtls.tlccot'dittg to l-cit.

Defense attorneys were furious at
Judge Clyne for what they felt were
"insufficent instructions to thejury.“
It was lack of knowledge. l-‘eit
believes. that led to Smith‘s two
count conviction. Smith was
sentenced to a five year probation
period by the judge.

So the process for appeal began.

Such a process is an expensive
one. and Smith with the aid of the
NAACP. American Civil Liberties
Union, teachers at SUNYA. and
community leaders. have begun a
fund raising drive to raise legal fees.
The Alton Smith legaldefensc fund
hopes to raise $2.000 through private
donations. and fund-raising events.
on-campus and off. The appeal will
be lodged with the Apellatc Division
of NY. stttte courts.

“Alton Smith is a remarkable
young man.“ says Paul Smith. a
chaplain at the University. and a
firm Alton Smith supporter. “He
battled his way up from a poverty
background. and he‘s displayed a
fantastic talent for art." Like many
others. Paul Smith does not believe
Alton Smith was capable of com-
rniting the crimes he was convicted
of.

D.A. backs his case

"Believe me." says Ralph Smith.
l).A. of Albany. “we took a good.
long look at this case before we
brotrglrt it to trial. Alton Smith did
have a line background, and be ob-
viously was a person of talent.“
Nevertheless. the D.A. felt the case
against Smith was strong enough to
bring to court. and strong enough to
win against any appeal.

“All these people who testify in
Alton Smith's behalf. how the hell
do they know what happened that
night?" asks Ralph Smith.

One person who does know it
Alton Smith himself. and he is reluc-
tant to talk for fear of endangering
his chances for appeal. ,

“The facts speak for themselves."
is all that Alton Smith will say about
the night of Nov. l.
