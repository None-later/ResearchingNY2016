There's two things every college student can use:
a break from the daily routine and an inexpensive :3
.meal. At Poppy's, we've coupled those two needs
V and come up with a great deal for you and a friend.
The next time you and a friend come to Poppy's.
we'll split the price of any large pizza with you

__ when you buy a pitcher of beer.
So come to Poppy's and get half of a Free Pizza

and a friend. It's a good deal and a lot of fun.

(Limit one per couple. Not valid on take-out orders.
Expires Oct. 20, l974.)

Right from the start. you
knew Tarnan tampons
were your best bet. They're
the only tampons to come
in three absorbency-sizes.
Regular. Super and
exclusive Junior — to help
young girls get started.
Tarnan tampons always
keep you feeling fresh,

And you always feel secure.
too. because you
know they’re softly
compressed for the
best absorption. You like
the assurance that nothing
shows when you wear them
and that you can'twa them.
You carry them discreetly.
You dispose of them easily.
You know that they're your
best bet when you‘re
buying sanitary protection.

But did you know
Taman tampons were also
your best buy? They come
in economical packages of
10's and 40’s, yet cost
about the same as other
brands that package
8's and 30's.

Taman tampons are
your best bet. And they're
also your best buy.
