similar surtax on corporationsé'or it may be voluntary. such as ﬁnanctal thrtfttness on

Thinkingback to a short seven or eight months ago. the people of Albany. residents. " '

students. faculty. and workers. were faced with a critical shortage of gasoline.a snor<
tage that had come close to paralyzing much of the EaStern United States. Lines for gas
were extensive, and prices began to rocket. At that time. Albany-area residents. mostly
facuuy and students. b'e'gania widespread car-pooling program to conserve gas. cut
down on costs. and. help make it through the winter. V

Winter hasn't'hit Albany yet. nor is there a critical shortage of gasoline, yet the need
for a earhpooling program is easily as important now as it will be in a few months. If we
are to prevent a repetition ofthe dangerous fuel situation that existed across the coun-
tryé ifwe are to prevent the oil magnates from forcing this country and the rest ofthe tn-
dustrialized world to its knees. if we are to prevent the collapse ofthe Third World at a
time when it is lirst beginning to show promise ofdevelopment, then localized efforts.
such as a modest car-pooling effort, such as the one we had last year. is a necessity. It IS
needed now, before it is too late.

Transcending Transitions

Transition is net/er a smooth procedure. Between one ad ministration and another.
or between one government and another. the transition period is a crucial time that
may set a tone for the running of that administration or government fora long time
thereafter. A transition between President Benezct‘s ad ministration and his successor‘s
will occur at the end of the spring semester. How quickly his successor can fill the posi-
tion and get the university running after Benezet‘s departure could shape the direction
this university will take during the next five years.

A transition .of equal importance occurs between changes in student government.

With the end of the Gerber StuldcntlAssoeiation' in May. the transition to the Curran, -r

administration seemed to have taken place very smoothly. and without complication:
The transition over the summer appeared to have prepared the returning students to
expect an effective Student Association. For live weeks. those expectations were not
disappointed. The results of the stgdent elections hasunfortunatcly changed that.

The electidnis for Central Council and University Senate had fortunately been
delayed by a CentraliCouncil bill for two weeks since no freshperson nor transfer stu-
dent knew the least bit about Central Council and the University Senate. Two weeks
later. the students knew something ol'what they were voting for. but S.A. was not quite
sure how to run the election. In transition. a new election commissioner was never
trained. not even selected. and was not prepared to take control ofthe fall election. As a
result. the entire proceedings lost theirvmeaning. as elections were extended and in-
validated when it was learned that one ofthe candidates was actuallya pollsitterduring
the elections. that names on the ballots were not ﬁxed. so that the students had no idea
who he voted for. and the absence of place for write-in ballots at some of the polling
places.

Students are justifiably disillusioned with this. the ﬁrstact that is visible tothe entire
student body by its elected S.A. ofﬁcials. A lesson must be learned from the mistake. A
future electoral catastrophe probably will not be as placidly received.

' Erroto

In the Council story on page one last Friday it was reported that Council voted to in~
validate some of the SA elections. Rather. SA President Pat Curran. under his ex-
ecutive powers. invalidated them. The'Class of '76 Council elections were not entirely
invalidated; only the commuter part was. As well. the Finance Committee bill passed
for funding Albany State Cinema was for $3.000, and not $500. as was reported.

Operating Procedures

 

The operation. It is on cveryone‘s mind.
Nett'sii'ee/t. the main source of hundreds of
thousands of Americans. publishes stories by
no less than seven reporters on the topic. Time
lends similar coverage to the event. The
mechanics of the operation. how Mrs. Ford is
responding to the surgery. how the family is
taking the crisis. the implications in the
political arena are all explored in depth. The
question is. why this amount of media
coverage“! The answer tio the query is. at the
very least disturbing.

The first consideration is that of common
courtesy. ls not Mrs. Ford entitled to some
amount of privacy in her time of torment?
After all. it does seem that it would be a
crttsliing psychological blow for a woman to
lose a breast. More important. her life hangs in
the balance. She sltottld have a time after the
operation simply to sort her thoughts and
decide upon how she wishes to live the
remainder of her life. This should not be a time
surrounded by glaring lights. crackling
microphones. and then and women with pads
and pencils. copying down every word Betty
from and her doctors say. It should be a
private time. one spent inquiet introspection.

Another consideration is ol'even grctiter int-
port. though. It concerns our View of what the
Presidency is and what. in fact. the office has
become in modern America. lfCongrcssmtin

It 'thllliti have been front-page news in

would. have received slightly less publicity
than Senator Birch Bayh‘s wife‘s breast cancer
surgery. You didn‘t know Marvellu litile had
the operation? Well. the surgery was similar
and It was performed on the wife ofu famous
Senator. One would think the press would pay
