stay through the weekend make up for their-leak of‘numbers. Few of
the tramplers are aware that their damage is repaired nightly while
they sleep. Even less realize that, long after they are in bed, people
are up, not playing, but working and performing some of the more
vital functions of the university.

A few who are aware, and happily so, are those whose excesses,
be they weekend or not, have managed to get the better of them. For
these stckly celebrants, the nighttime infirmary with its quiet atmo-
sphere andgentle nurses provides more good feeling than a quick
swrg of Southern Comfort ever could.

A few are aware and unhappy, too. They're the ones whose ex-
cesses make them more decadent than sick: As a result they find

OCTOBER 8, 1974

by Nancy Albaugh
‘y just looking at him, stripped
B away from the glamour and the
aura that surrounds Rolling
Stone Magazine, you can't distinguish
him from any other young executive
the morning after. lann Wenner is the
little boy made good. He isa traditional
American Dream success story in a
new culture. And he's nervous as hell.
A Berkeley dropout who started an
underground paper that grew (and is
growing), he still retains that sense of
the absurd, You get the feelingthat he
sometimes steps back and laughs at
himself—at the all too close
resemblance to that young executive.
We walked (15 minutes late and lick-
ing our hair down) into the dark red
room of the restaurant—a strange mix—
ture of the innocent, rustic country,
with its pine tables and panels; and the
experienced Moulin Rouge, with the
dark, hanging, red drapes. That com-
binalion of naivete and experience is
also Rolling Stone. lann is the link
between the back-to-nature people's
movement and the glittering decadent
rock stars. He is dressed in a regular
blue and red plaid shirt, just like he
wore in the late sixties, but he has an
awareness that could come only from
the post-coital seventies.
lann was sucking Bloody Marys that
matched the drapes. i couldn't tell
whether he always got smashed at
noon or whether he had staged the
whole thing to impress all the young
reporters sent by seasoned editors who
figured their young apprentices would
know the most about "that hippie
magazine." What the editors didn't
realize was that they themselves might
understand better the institutionaliza—
tion of Rolling Stone.

They might see it as representative of
the institutionalization of anything
once it gets big enough or rich enough.

But if anyone gets credit for making
Rolling Slone gather its readers it is
lann,

What is with this kid dropout that he
makes such a rise? It's not his manner
of speaking to you. He has this an-
noying habit of looking down at the
other person's hands, or chest. Only
rarely did he manage to pry his head
upto took one of us in the eye, and that
was in answering those few questions
he hadn't heard before. [felt like 1 real-
ly had to prod himtogethimto look up.
Anne Wexler, his pressperson and
public relations manager from New
York, a dark cigarette—lhroated ex-
potilic, explained the problem. "He's
been awake for two days. He's really
very tired."

Later, in reference to his National At-
lairs Editor's habits of writing and
drinking for 100 hour stints, Wenner

said: "I don't know how Hunterdoes it.

He stays up for three days at a time.

He's amazing." His eyes were brighter
when he spoke of HunterThompson—
that brash "new ioumalist" who would
never write down any of the executive
rhetoric lann seems at times com—
pelted to give. Perhaps that is part
of the reason lann was nervous, he did
have to give out a certain amount of
rhetoric. In any event, he shredded a
piece of paper with deft precision
while talking about the origin of his
magazine.

Rolling Stone was started because
Wenner sawa niche to fill. He thought
that anything written about drugs,
rock, or the New Left "was either myth
or nonsense." What he wanted was
tough, thoughtful reporting of
"cultural, stylistic and attitudinal
changes" among the young. "I
thought 1 knew what people wanted to
road."

He evidently did. Today the
magazine has a circulation of nearly a
half a million spread over three con—
tinents. It sounds impressive now, but
the first issue wasa different story. in a
fit of optimism (or stoned madness),
they made up 40,000 copies. 34,000
of them came back.

Today they havea professional staff,
Hunter Thompson- and toe Eszterhas,
among others. They solicit famous

writers—Tom Wolfe, Andy Warhol. “I
think we have access to more
professional people now," Wenner ex-
plains. But this wasn't so when they
started. Six volunteers in a rent-free
attic somewhere in San Francisco

churned out a little counterculture rag. .

Today, the rent they pay per month
(over $7,000) nearly exceeds the $7,-
500 Iann scraped together seven
years ago.

Some in the late sixties said the
magazine was representative of the
counter—culture. But what happened?
Has its status been changed?

"Well, this is the counter-culture.
We're living in it. It's been in-
stitutionalized." So has Rolling Stone
magazine. it is now looked upon as the
journalistic bible of the coast with
writers like Thompson and Eszterhas.
They take what they're doing
seriously—but they also have fun.

After the Woodstock flowers wilted,
everyone thought Rolling Stone would
dry up and blow away through the
wind, like so many other publications
from thatera did. ButStonedidn't. The
editors broadened theircoverage to in-
clude things like the Manson murder
trials and the Altamont concert
murders. They cracked stories,
stepped on toes, and gained in circula-
tion. But they also had a big industry to
cover, an industry that hasn't wilted-—

advertisers whose clients get panned.
"Anyone who would be that‘offended
by what we say wouldn’tadvertise with
us anyway."

lann's responsibilities have chang-
ed since the early days. He used to be
the day-to-day editor—assigning
stories, breaking reporter's backs for
stories; now he can afford to have less
of the soul work.

“I edit Hunter's stuff," he says with a
little gleam. All of a sudden I had a vi-
sion of him dreaming at night of grow-
ing up to become Hunter.

"t read most of the features for every
issue." When he's not making little
tours, that is.

But even so, around the office, it's
only half joke when people call him
“Citizen Wenner," says the Time'article
of ’73. You can believe that, too. This is
a new kind of a link between the two

is extremes, a man who -can understand

both the sometimes naive Bob Dylan
youth (Dylan is one of his favorites) and
the more decadent David Bowie tans.
It's this understanding that got him
where he is today.

Asked about the connection
between the two movements—the
back-to-nature vs. the decadent
sophistication of others, lann really

' didn't follow the question. But he tried.

("He's very tired, you know," Anne
piped in, lighting yet another
cigarette.)

"Rock music is the only really
American art through and through. I
mean you look at the origins of rock —
stemming from jazz and all that."

He was mutilating a twist 'emtie 'em
thing like the ones on loaves of bread.
Then he stretched his mouth open to
his back teeth and started chewing, in
the same placea catchews something
when it is really tough.‘. "lt's commer-
cial art, like any mass art. lt'sloud. lt's
brassy. Not terribly subtle. But I can't
think of anYthing more American."
Rolling Stone follows that
Americanization. lann looks with dis-
dain at any of the paper's competition.
"They're pretty bad. Nothing really
worthwhile has come out." He looks at
his editor hands, the hands that
created his empire and the look on his
face seemed to say, ”No one can take it
away."
