Midnight Motives

The people who clean, protect and
nurse this University in the after-
midnight hours have a lot of different
reasons for staying up so late. Some
want to avoid the traffic; others think
the nighttime atmosphere brings peo»
ple closer together. Parents either want
to be with theirchild ren during the day
or have to work at two jobs in order to
support them. Many are stuck. They
can'tgelbetterpositionsorhaveto wait
for promotions which will bring better
hours.

While motives differ, the ex-
periences of night workers are often
similar. Night people discover the
secrets that day people don’t have time
to look for. The places they was
assume an unreal quality as a result of

being unnaturally empty. This mysti-
que wears off on workers who, like
Alexander Dzieniszewski, also have
something of the supernatural about

.1 them. ~

It’s 2 am. and on the third floorof the
Campus Center WSUA’s “Night
Traveler" Bill Daughtry is scavenging
through the few records that haven't
been played the night before, Next
door the staff of the Albany Student
Press gives in to the hysteria caused by
exhaustion, gives up on ten more
layout corrections and writes an in-
coherent good-moming. letter to the
printer. They comment on the
sacrifices involved in working all night
and wonder where they ever got the
energy to do it.

If Mr. Hoban, supervisor of the Cam-
pus Center maintenance staff heard
them he would roar. Five nights a week
2 am. is the middle of the day for him
and his staff.

Mr. Hoban stands in the big, empty
lobbyof the Campus Center. Nobody

- is using the bathroom, nobody is sell—

ing jewelry. nobody is losing money in
the. vending machines. The steps are
polished, all the chairs down below in

_ secrets that an. -   time to look for.

thing on thel l is a broom. Mr.
Hoban has the to it takes to make
things like that I, ppen. He speaks
and his men tter, like chimney
sweeps cleanin n Santa Claus.

The women ‘ mble modem Liza

next to her mop ‘- broom wagon.

“How long v - you been doing

"Five years."  .

"Do you ever '- the graffiti?"

"Garn. no.”

"Notevenso imes?"

"Well, maybe. .

"Does it ever take you laugh?"

"No!"

"Maybe a littlef

"Well. some dﬂmake me laugh."

 

She looked down at the acid solution
used to clean off the writing. BeforeMr.
Hoban had said that "it burns your
lungs out."

Mr. Hoban knows other secrets too.
Garbage can be very revealing.

"Re-cycling is for the birds—when I
see the mess in here. Once we had to
use snow shovels to clean up the mess
after a Pizza Party. if they preach it they
should practice it." Maybe there are
some things day people should try to
hide from night people . . .ifthey can.

It is already 3:30 and the white
gowned princesses guarding the
sleeping castle let you in and say
they've‘been waiting. ‘ ‘

lane Fay and Kathryn Polsinello are
night nurses in the Infirmary, working
the midnight to eight shift. The placid.
intelligent faces on the two women turn
them into refreshing, almost ethereal
beauties. They sit in the empty waiting
room while the clock makes a knock-
ing noise that no one ever hears during
the day, and gently, using quiet tones
in order not to wake the patients, dis-
cuss the routines and problems of the
shift. it's difficult to relate that subject to
this situation, and more difficult not to
imagine the two women as something
not of our world.

Night Watch ' g " 1'

.m t

At 4 'a.m.*Ofticers Gary Sylke ‘and

Mary Daley are circling the Campus in
their Security car, discussing some of
the more serious incidents Jen-
countered by the night 'shift. Sylke
says: j ' ‘ I ' ’ I '
' "One night we gota suicide'call. We
went downand spoke to him“ for a'cou-
ple of hours. We tried to cheer him up
and told him to ‘Hang in there ' and not
to give up because he had alot to live
for. We put him in the car with‘u‘s and
this individual rapped with us and in
the end he felt betbr." ' ' ' "

Not-exactly something‘out of the Psy-
ch book‘s/yeti“ worked. Daley explain-
ed why: . '

“You don't come on as Mr. Law and
Order—or as a therapist, either."
Maybe they have something there.

The Security 'officers know other
secrets too. They know which parking
lot has the most thieves after midnight,
what to do with freshpersons caught
carrying couches from the Campus
Center and even what happened to the
woman reported missing and "only
wearing a teesshirt."

Classes start at eight and by eight-
thirty the chairs are uneven again in
the Campus Center, the infirmary fills
up With doctors and cases and the
Security ca rs get lost among the Beetle
Volkswagens. And the people who
made all those things into betterthings
for a while have gone home to deal
with the important things in life, like
kissing children good morning,
deciding whether to have dinner or
breakfast, and best of all, sleeping.
