On the first night of class however,
Lennig introduced us is his course by
offering many iokes, asoft shoe, and an
inquiry in front of the 150 students in
LC 18 as to whether the number 132

Three .years later Arthur Lennig is a
little bal \r but basically the same. The
love for 9 fantasy world of the cinema
is. as strong as ever, and so is the
romantic desire ‘gcrieate some,

level than if: 0 we find in our
mundane existence.) .

One lifelong desire is being fulfilled
now. After nine years of research, he
has written the biography of his
boyhood hero, Bela Lugosi, and will
see it released this week by G. P. Put-‘
nam’s Sons, under the title The Count
(available by _Nov. in our bookstore).

For many, Lugosi will remain the
mere number two horror man in
moviedom, behind Boris Karloff, yet to
others he is now a cult hero of great
proportion. in this book he seems to be
even more, because lennig under-
takes a labor of love asa repayment for
past considerations and thrills given
him by the man who started the horror
genre with his 1931 portrayal of

"Dracula."

iennig also writes about his own ex—
perience with Lugosi, as "the boy" who
invites “the count" to his Long island
home to see the cellar-like shrine he
has erected in honor of his idol.

Would they encounter starved and

revengeful slaves from Lugosl’s past
films? . . . To the boy the cellar was
hopelessly prosiac, but sh'll, there was
the shrine. Lugosi looked happily

Only by using his Peter iorre voice,
while hunching his back and quoting
from Poe’s ‘Telltale Heart"—“still, the

tapping the live microphone hidden in

class for the film.

The mood ‘waslosthoweverwhen his

America which can play, at different
speeds, syncronized scores with silent
films—began to fade in and outon the
film’s soundtrack. Apologizing first to

the class viewed the film.

“Vince, i'm tired,” he said, his head

America who puts icomplete

students whom he finds both "bright

had done injustice toanart."l'he films,"

he said when we had reached his of- '

fice, "were designed for music and
they need it. i show them because of
the various aspects of the art which
they demonstrate when shown cor-
rectly."

The office takes the uninitiated
aback. Here; in FA 323, seemingly
every movie lobby card in existence
lines the walls. At the far end is a
cluttered desk, behind which is a
sketch of D. W. Griffith with a quote by
him on the nature of art.

Posters of Chaplin’s Tramp, Lugosi's
Dracula, King Kong, and Rudolph
Valentino, hand-painted stills of
Barthelmess andDempster in Griffith's
tropical romance Love Flower, and a
larger lobby card BhOWinql Henry B.
Walthall shoving a Confederate flag
into a Yankee cannon in Griffith's

walls. I

Beneath them, even more precious
no doubt, are two smaller framed
momentoes. One is an autographed
photo of a young Neil Hamilton, a Grif-
fith star of 1925 who later achieved TV

fame as Commissioner Gordon in the -

Batman series. The other is an invita-
tion to iennig for the inaugurationof
John F. Kennedy as President.
Lennig is less motivated and more
cynical concerning politics today, but
his love for the film is unwavering "i

like,  Elthink in terms of films," he says.

"i too them seriously before most peo-

ple did.

 
 

“i started the IFG (international Film
Group) as a student here in.1953.
When 1 went to Wisconsin, i helped
form one of the three best college film
societies in America. Dartmouth was
one also." He did not recall the other.

As a freshman in college he began
film-making himself and overthe years
became intensely interested in the
silent film—especially, the work of
Griffith—and the sound film of the ear-
ly thirties. Yet his love of the horror
genre, and his deep feelings for Lugosi
remained. ,

‘The' horror film is aesthetically in-

teresting in its use of atmosphere,_
Gothicism, Romanticism, and German ‘

lighting and texture. But I was par-
ticularly pleased with Lugosi because
he had such style—“clan if you will. A
lot of films had villains but Lugosi was
an elegant one. He was a 'harbinger of
the night.’ "

In his words both spoken and
written, Lennig reveals a certain em-
pathy with the Lugosi character of
films. "He was a great contrast to the
goody-goody values being portrayed
back in the 40's when iwas a kid. it was
more difficult to have odd tastes and be
eccentric then, under extreme peer-
group pressure.”

Curiously, the "people" come off
rotherbadly in horrorfilms, as opposed
to their golden virtues in "message"
pictures . . . It may be thathorror films
are more honest about man’smotives
than the films praised for their so-
called reality . . . the people are often
more villainous than the monster and
perhaps are even more evil, because
they act in the name of/ustice and self-
righteous anger. (page 244)

Lennig sits back and begins to fill his

pipe with Borkum Riff tobacco.
Lighting up, he goes‘on, "You had to
make a choice then—either to give in
to the things around which you didn't
believe in, or also go on your lonely
way."
Vol/in (Lugosi ’s role in "The Raven”)
is the supreme egotist, but a man
whose genius warrants much of his
own high estimation of himself His dif-
ficulties no doubthave come from the
conflict of his own giant will and talent
with those of the "competent" ones
who plague his life. (page 184)

 

  

 

 

“You have to believe in Lugosi
because he is no sluggard. He's either
going to transfer brains, or mix the

. blood of an ape with that of a woman’s.

it is a kind of ritual where we always go
to see if maybe he'll make it thistime."

Whereas in reallife we must all suf-‘
fer various kinds of indignities and
fmstrctions, Lugosi is able to triumph,
of least for a while, over so-called law
and order. How delightful to have an
irritating colleague turned into a zom-
bie to do your bidding. (page 19)

Yet iennig stresses that the book is
more than just a fond rememberance.
"i did a tremendous amount of
research, went through university
vaults, examined scripts, and tried to
kill off the myths which existed around
the man. i went to Flumania and
Hungary to study his early stage and
film career and to see both his
homeland and Transylvania: a trip I
had dreamed about since eighth
grade."

bennig's next project which he has
been workng on since 1968 is a
biography of D. W. Griffith, the "father
of the motion picture."

5 he speaks about it his eyes begin
to brighten further and he points out, “i
do not study Griffith as a pioneer
merely—was some people do—buf
more in terms of the sheer humanity of
his work. When shown at the 'proper
speed and sound track, his films still re—
tain much of their emotional power.

"We are living in an alrnostinhuman
age with anemphasis onviolence, por-
nography, and the desire to 'be cool.’
Some of the most genuine things we
sneer at as being trite. i myself was
once too young and cynical to ap-
preciate Griffith's humanity.

"in his films, Griffith tried to
reconstruct the Southem dreams of his
youth, whether they were the idyllic
visions of heroism or the depiction of

young love. He is really like the young
Dr. Frankenstein . . . "

Bending down to the bookcase by
the side of his desk, Dr. Lennig came
up with a book and a quote from the fic-
tional scientist who tried to enter
"God's domain": “Have you never
wanted to look beyond the clouds and
the stars, or to know what causes the
trees to bend and what changes the
darkness into light? But if you talk like
that people call you crazy."

"Here is a man with a quest," states
Lennig. "Everyone says he cannot
fulfill his dreams. Yet, hetriesfo. That i
believe in. That book,” and he points to
my copy of The Count, "is proof that
dreams come true if you work hard
enough.

"Whenever l'd fake the book to a
publisher, they'd say ‘Who is Lugosi?“
Now he's a cult hero. [suppose if i live

well, not all of them," and he chuckles
as his eyes

Then he grows serious again as he
says, "You know, if I weren't pulling for
my main character, I wouldn't want to
do it. i would like to create (iii un-
cmolional response for the reactor if i
can. You should feel sad, after all, when
a man dies.

"When i reread my manuscript
about this event, i realized it did not
recapline what i felt at the time. Then
after 10 minutes of emotional fervor, i
wrote it again."

Wurtlswmlhmn sense. "The boy"
meets his; heroby the stage door: There
was no swagger lo the man stepping

through the door. He seemed almost to
sneak out. The boy greeted him, and
Lugosi his face lighting up, said,
"Hello, Arthur," even remembering
the boy 5 name. There was conversa-
tion fora lewmmutes, butLugosi waslll
at ease. Tlro/ he had appeared in a

As we got up to return to his class
and students, Lennig spoke, and the
boy seemed lhare again: "Intellectual-

sometimes a very sad thing but it’s a
very special thing also."

The movie had ended by the time we
returned and the class sat waiting for
his closing question and answer
period. Someone asked about Griffith's
abundance of close-ups of Lillian Gish
throughout lBroken Blossoms. “li's
simplified, because Griffith's idyllic
visions were captured in that one
face,” he answered.

Another asked about the implicit
sexual reference in the whipping the
cruel faihergives his daughter. uI don‘t
know," answered Lennig, "i've never
been into whipping. i'm saving
something for my old age." Much
laughter and some applause.

A final question concerned how
much Griffith empathized with the
Chinese hero, in his love for Gish. Len-
nig, hands in pockets, hesitated for a
second, and slowly spoke, "A lot i'd
say. Any man who writes a book or
does a film puts much of himselfihlo lf'."

it was 10:40. The class disbanded. A
few gathered around Lennig for some
last questions, before he removed his
ailing projector from the scene. He
would have to fix it one more time,
because it was something which
dreams were made on. " '
