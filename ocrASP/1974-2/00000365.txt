If you haven't seen the movie Easy Rider. 1
would suggest that you take it in if it ever com-
es to town. While the more visible aspects of
the social and cultural tensions which made
that powerful ﬂick possible have to a large ex-
tent subsided. the underlying problems that
are addressed linger on. Easy Rider offers
many classic themes that are worth exploring
but i would like to confine myself to focusing
on one that truly “lingers on" in the hearts and
minds of at least some of us.

The newspaper advertisements for Henry
Fonda‘s movie usually consisted of an engrav-
ing of Captain America (played by Fonda)
astride his soup’ed-up chopper coupled with
the legend that a: ; yﬁﬁ-lodkihg for

to become a surgeon. After one and half years
I switched majors because leouldn‘t cope with

aren‘t taught how to compete except with '
other girls. and then only if they are ﬁghting

are changed because we aren‘t taught how to
give all. Competition is a male trait. and when
women exhibit this characteristic they are
labeled “masculine”. or worse. a “castrating
female".

Band sat between showsglirst Satur-

_ day night. was a poster advertising a

meeting of the Career Development
Society. When guitarist Jeff Hanna
saw it. he laughed and said. “We've
been playing since Hob. I hope We‘re
developing a career.“

It isn‘t likely that many ofthe peo-
ple \\ ho saw the Nitty Gritty Dirt
Band in the ilallrootn knew they had
been around that long. Most have
heard the nante. and some know of
the “Will the Circle Be Unbroken"
albtnn the Dirt Band recorded two
years ago with many great Nashville
musicians. Few people knew what to
expect from the band.

l'hcy opened the lirst show with
sortie blues rockers. and gradually
moved into the country and
bluegrass music they do best. The
crowd was holding back. though.
The applause was polite. and reserv-
ed. Not until the Dirt Band played
Hank Williams‘ “Jambalaya” did
anyone get up to dance. The dancer
was a woman who had come from
Vermont to see them. She continued
dancing front that song to the end of
the second show.

From thcn on the energy was up.

Steve Martin came out to warm

McEucnx played a banjo medley
which included the beautifulspoken
ballad “Whipporwhill.” He sat
onstage alone. without shoes.ubder

' with his very personal message.‘

After the encore of “Circle.” they

"Foggy. Mountain Breakdown."
They left the stage to a tremendous
standing ovation.

to the Dirt Band.

"You guys are my favorites. lgot
