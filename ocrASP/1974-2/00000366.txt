Piano Sensitive

by Myron E. Bruin

Concerts are the most exciting
ways of enjoying music. and
premieres often matte the most exv

citing concerts. Albany. which is a'
town ol'neitherprofessional listeners
nor musicians. claims an orchestra
which. in its' 44th year is more im-
pressive thiiri ever. The ﬁnest
moments for the orchestra. marked
by bold climaxes and tender
softness. was during Beethoven‘s
('mit'erlu fill“ i’iaiiiiiyiri’f ‘b'ir'i'iilesrra
No. 3. PianistMaicolmFrager‘s clari-
ty and sensitive feel for the music
seemed to inspire the orchestra to
new heights. From a purely musical
point of view. the players performed
the piece with tltc sincerity that one
usually associates with good
orchestras. '

The A80 seems to enjoy playing
the “heavies” much more than other
pieces and consistently do better on
those written by the more prominent
composers. Strangely. these are the
more challenging pieces.
Traditionally. ASO progntms in-
clude a lesser known work. Tonight
it was Blacher‘s Variations on a
The/mt by Paganini. So obscure is
this composer that both his ﬁrst and
last name appmred in the program.
It is good to see the A50 expose
itself to different music. for it will
only prodttce a more will rounded
orchestra.

Conductor .lr-rrus Hegyi is an ex-
ample of one of those who mainly
keep time. What other conductors
do is make .1 visual display of the
music for the players to look at and
understand. Since there are almost

too musicians in a symphony
orchestra. each with his or her own
ideas. there isa need for one person.
the conductor. to interpret the
music. -

To fully appreciate the A50. one
must consider its members. While
some are college faculty members.
the bulk of the orchestra consists of
people from other walks of life. such
as housewives. students.

consideration. their program and
performance is admirable. One
never goes to he owed by grandeur.
one goes to enjoy a nice symphony
concert. It tonight‘s opening is any
indication. it looks as though the
Albany Symphony is going to hrtvea

OCTOBER 8, 1974

an

' [by Marla Abrams ,

'l‘he S.U.N.Y.A. Theater Depart-
ment presented The Ritircrs of
Eldritch as their ﬁrst production of
the term. it ran from October 2-6.
The word “rimcrs” means miners.
and. as the title connotes. The
Rr'rm'rzr of Eldritch deals with life
and death in a small mining town.

The script by Lanl'ord Wilson cap-
tures the essence of the futility of
such an existence by using recurring
dialogue. He also employs several
other imaginative effects. such as
one scene which opened with the
same dialogue as the previous one
ended.

the opening scene whetted otrr
appetites to find out “exactly what
happened in Eldritch.“ As we listen
to two old ladies gossiping about the
totvnfolk and the horrendous event
that affected them all. we hccortte
l'amiliarized with the members ofthe
town and their connection with the
“crime.” Eldritch is depicted as the
classic small town where “everyone
knows everyone else‘s business "

Barbara Zapp‘s lighting cllccts
blended with Robert J. Donnelly‘s
creative staging. Jerome llanlcy‘s
direction carried the thcmecllcctivc-
ly.

 

 

'l'hrougli flashbacks. we see the
trial and tire events which
t'oreshadow tltc rtttrrdcr of art old.
disreputable man named Skelly. well
portrayed by Christopher Paul. The
totvn views Skelly as disgusting.
suspicious and evil. This is because
ltc is filtlty rrrtd unkempt and is often
seen peering through windows.
Although we cart ascertain early in
the play that the characters are
referring to him when they speak of
‘thc murder.‘ we do not knowthnt he
was rtot the one who molested rt
crippled girl named Nelly. played by
Marilyn ()rnstcin. for which he was
killed.

l‘lir'oughout tltc play. the two old
ladies are heard saying. "When I
think of tltc ctil irt this world."
Ironically. they hate lrtbclcd tltc
wrong person "ctil". while tltc least

young man riamcd Robert is
revealed as tltc tr‘trc molester.
