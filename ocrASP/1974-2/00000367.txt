SUN YAC Success

by Mlltc Piekerskl

“Well. two out of three ain't had!“
In fact. it‘s pretty good. when you
rcalilc the Great Dane Varsity
liascbail squad is now sportinga 6-1
record in SUNYAC competition,
after taking two from Buffalo State
and dropping one to New Paltzovcr
tltc past wcck.

So what if the Danc‘s overall
record is 6-7. So what if they lack
consistency. As long as you win in
the Conference. you're doing all
right, baby.

The “road trip" began with is 10-2
shcllacking at the hands of New
l’altz. as Albany suffcrcd its initial
SUNYAC setback. “We just playcd
poorly.“ Coach Hurlingamc ad-
miltcd. liut the main problem was
the pitching. Using four diffcrcnt
hurlcrs. Burlingamc still saw his staff
issuc thirtccn walks. 'l‘hc Dttncs tic-
lualiy out—hit the winners by it 7-6
margin. but were unable to muster
any offense.

and allowing scvcn sal'ctics. Blair
“was tough in thc clutch" according
to the coach. Burlingamc cxplttincd

scoring and scwcd up Albany's fifth

in thc nightcap, it was (iiulianclli

John Dolla rd protcctcd thc lead over

i‘ollard scattered seven hits in

lnry and struck out six in going the
distance. “11c pitcli.d a real good
gnmc; a strong gttmc“, cxclnimcd
llnrlingamc.

lint Buffalo came back with single

following inning tnadc it a 2-2
hallgamc.

With two down in thc Danc sixth.
it was spa rkplug Olivcras again. with
another base on balls. Nelson‘s dou-
blc and Willnnghhy‘s wulk set the
stage for Giulittnclli's game-winning
bust: hit, as the Dancs captured their

triumph of the season.

they defeated Willierns College; 20-
37 for their ninth win afthe season.
One couldn‘t ask for'morc perfect
weather this past Saturday end the
am: could. just about. be said for
the Albany times. With sunny.werm
conditions prevailing. the barriers
needed little prompting to show off
their talents. as every Albany runner
turned in a personal best time.
According to Coach Bob Munscy.
“Time-wise we ran great. but space-
wisc it wasn‘t too good.“
Nonetheless. Co-Capitains Carlo
Chcrbino and Vinnie Roda were
once again at the head of the pack.
and recorded times of 25:31 and
25:41. over the ﬁve mile Albany
course. The Danes made it a sweep
of the first three places. as Steve
Arthur came in with a 26:19.
Williams placed their first man
across with a 26:34. He was then
followed in by BrianDtsvitt.who rants
26:43. Other Albany times were
Doug Van th (27:11). Eric Jackson
(27:14). and Fred Kitzrow (27:21).
Considering it was only ll dual
meet. and thus lacked the greater
pressure of larger meets. the times
were exceptionally lust. Cherubino‘s
time was the 14th best time ever run
on the SU NYA campus and was the
3rd best time cvcr turned in by an

meet there. Coach Munscy feels that _

the Colgate meet is coming et en
awkward time since. bcoeusc es the
season progresses. it becomes more
difﬁcult for the ntnncrs to remain
physically sound and mentally psye
chcd for each new meet. Theweck
after Colgate is the all important
S U N VAC Championships at
Brockport. which is what the teens is
really geared for.

‘ch can't stay up there forever. 3‘
says Munsey. “It took- us a few days
togct over the Army thing. lt‘sjusta
question of which ones we went, to
think of most. For ourown salvation
we want to think of the Conference
meet.”

Team on Upswinl

Obviously the squad is on the up-
swingas each man has been bettering
his own time in each successive meet.
11‘ they can retain this high level of
performance throughout the up-
coming wccks. the _hariicrs just
might walk away with a larger piece
of the action than. many people

Things weren't much better in the se-
cond halfas Albany was defeated 29-
7.

'i‘hc offense was rittlcd by
countless errors and thc dcfcnsc was
unable to compete with the endless
pressure of play. Some outstanding
players in the game were Dave
Duprcy. the quarterback and Jim
Pollack a receiver for the offense.
The defense was held together by
Kcvin Murphy, is possible prospect

well. A brief but citccllent perfor-
mance was tumedt-in by Martin
