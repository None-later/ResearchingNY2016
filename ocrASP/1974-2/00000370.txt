He added. however. that the flagrant

disregard- by the students hurt-his

This example supports a state-
ment by Director Williams. the head

'of Security. that the University

Police “don't ntake too many
arrests.“ While emphasizing that the
department has full police powers.
he stated that 'it uses discretion in
carrying out its duties.

The incident also sheds some light I

on the nature of the relationship

. between a unique police force and ‘
the community that it serves. Many . .

ofﬁcers in thcunitfeel that security is
specially suited to handle the univer-
_'sity community. Officer Frank Cun-
ningham explained that they were

. one of the very few units to have two

years of college as an entrance re-

. irquirement. " He also contrasted the

discretion‘us'ed by the University

“ IPolice to the tactics of some other
police units. 'He stated that the

forces is that they receive their power
from the Edu'ation Law rather than
the Criminal Procedure Law. While
the Education Law does grant
Security police powers. there are
some unique distinctions. Ofﬁcer
Robert Boehler explained that their
jurisdiction is such that several
judges will view the validity of off-
cainpus police actions‘differently.
He also” stated that the Education
Law gives them greater leeway to act
in the best interests of the university.
but he also feels that it place; more
restrictions on them than a unit un-
der 1 the Criminal Procedure Law
would have."

Firearms 1 Limited

The University Police are limited
in their use of ﬁrearms. Only the
director.vthe supervisor. and the in-
vestigators are'allowed to carry
guns. then this leaves only one

. policeman on campus who is
armed—a sore- spot for many of-
ficers. ,  ,. .,

Students Courteous

The attitude toward students on
the Saturday evening shift appeared
to be good. Contact between ofﬁcers
and students was courteous and
helpful from both sides. Ofﬁcer Jim
Gardener said that he has enjoyed

pressed the opinion that most
serious crimes are caused by out-

Hearing Aid
' Consumers, Says NYPIRG

The New York Public interest
Research Group (NYPIRG) called
upon state legislators “to act swiftly
to prevent unscrupulous hearing aid
dealers 'from victiinizing con-
sumers."

“At present it is open season on

fhearing-impaired consumers.“
_ NYPIRG researcher Sharon Frink . ,
charged. “Many dealers prey upon

the insecurities of the elderly and the
handicapped.“ she said.

Ms. Frink's charges came in
testimonydelivered today before the.
Select’Commitlee on Consumer
Protection apd the Temorary State
Commissionivon Problems of the
Deaf. at hearings on iicensure of
hearing aid dealers . held in
Rochester.

She criticized legislation spon-
sored last year by Monroe County
Assemblyman Frank Carroll.

because “it would amount to a blank
check to dealers and would offer to
consumers only a false sense of
protection.“ Carroll‘sr legislation

.; In " July or this 1 year.
program in: Chemistry,

Albany. .was placed"

"ProvisionallyAcceptable”cat cry '
by' a committee representing the-

State Department of Education.

Tcrmed “a program that might a

reasonably achieve the standards of

high quality after a three-year"

period.“ the department will: be
reevaluated after three years. At that

,time the program may move up to

classiﬁcation I) “Acceptable”—if
problems havebccn conqucrcd. or it
may move down to classiﬁcation 3)
“Unacceptable: a program that
should be discontinued"——if
problems somehow overwhelm the
program. ~

Dr. Antony F. Saturno. newly ap-
pointed as chairman of the
Chemistry Department. feels strong-,
iy that the former situation will be
more likely to occur. Although ad-
mitting to some "initial shock" over
the secondary classification. Satur-
no feels that the committee’s
statements are not a deathknell when
put in the proper perspective.

“The two biggest factors brought
out by thecommittce.“ says Saturno.
“were that the department needed
strong internal leadership. and that
the size of the graduate student body
was too small in relation to the
number of faculty."

At the time of the evaluation. the
department had no chairman. so
with Suturno‘s subsequent ap-
pointmctn. one-half of its problems
appeared solvable. The other half
will not be solved by a single ap-
point‘ment.’ it will take many added
enrollments.

Present trends show that the
number of graduate students is on
the decline. particularly in physical
chemistry. One remedy may be
found in what Saturno "terms “con-
crete recruitment activities." Twenty
recruiting seminars. to be conducted
around the state. have already been
budgeted for this purpose at $50 per
trip.

A surer answer however. would
seem to be found through an in-
crease in the relatively low amount
of financial support now given to
graduate students. it is a situation
that the evaluation committee was
well aware of. "The present level of
intemnl funding for the doctoral
program is quite low." the report
states.

Saturno is encouraged by the
SUNY Central Ofﬁce's recent accep-
tance of a proposal to raise a
graduate stipend from its present
$2800 per year. to $3300. Dr. Vin-
cent F. Cowling. Deanofthe Math
and Science Departments. points
out. however. that this is far from
assures the $500 increase.

“There have been a large number
of schools whose proposals have

been approved by Central Officesp

and then not been approved by an
appropriate legislative committee."
says Cowling. "We only can have our
fingers crossed in hopes that it will
pass."

He points out that such decisions
are often made on a "work load——
resources" formula. Under this
frustrating system. money is
allocated when added enrollments
and advanced programs are in
process. Unfortunately. without
added funds. such desired situations
rarely arise. It is reasoning of this
manner which has made it possible
for no new faculty line to open up in
the last five years. .

Nevertheless. Cowling is deter-
mined to “light tooth and nail to

consequences of being dropped are

pointments.“ He points out that

“All we want is a chance to prove
what we can do. i happen to think
that we have an excellent Chemistry
department. doing excellent work

and research. There are people in

every single area of thesciencedoing

ﬁne work."
Saturno Sees No Suffering

“i personally don‘t see the
program as _,suffering. merely
because of a lack of funding." says
Stuumo. "If we proceed in a positive
manner. we should not be in any
trouble.“

survey of . nearly 200.000 incoming freshmenat'  schoo, y
Cooperative Institution, Research Project (CIRP). 42% of the stud'etits
reported that they resided with their parents. _

A recent issue of _ Research Guri'enis. published by the Washiriﬂon
ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education. has compiled «me of the in
studies done on commuter students and their characteristics. I, V _ _  -

The primary reason for commuting is ﬁnancial beneﬁts. concluded a study, "
in the late I960'si by Robert French and Craig Scott of almost 33,000
students at 800differenl colleges. These “local attenders" lived at home while
commuting to classes and were mostly from lower family income groups.

Yet a study this year by Elizabeth Suchtir for the College Entrance‘Ex-
aminotidn Board revealed that the actual difference in college costs between
commuters and residents is only about $300 per year. ' l ‘ .

Some of the‘dil‘l‘crcncc. if not all of it. Suchar pointed out. may be
eliminated by higher transportation costs that resident students do not have
to pay. making the actual financial commitment of both commuters and
residents about the same. ' ' ‘ '

Nonetheless. financial considerations obviously play a big role for com- .
mutcrs. A study done at Wayne State University in Michigan found that the .
typical commuter at that school spent six hours a day commuting or work-
ing. With that many hours involved. these students usually scheduled
courses grouped together and often left campus immediately after classes.

With such a schedule. commuters often have little time for normal college-
reluted extracurricular activities and for developing relationships with other

students and faculty. _
