enough.” He [joined the Young
Socialist Alliance and became active
in the black liberation. movement.
Now Dixon feels that one struggle is
the same for all oppressed by the
“capitalist system." '

tasked him to tell me more about;

his individual reasons for joining
something so general as a movement
against oppression. He answered by
informing me that the-sense of my
question vias wrong..The Socialist
Workers Party was organized as a
qutlclittn to ‘Concretcact‘sof brutali-
ty.“ Dixon personally felt this in-
justice and has seen it affect other
people. It is only logical'that people
would unite for this reason. he said. ,
A “life and death struggle“ is‘going 3‘
on that can‘t be ignored.

'Streiallsts‘ vocabulary

' Dixon then began a discourse tre-
quently. quoting the socialists‘
vocabulary of categories and con-
venient ‘generaliwtions. He un-
derlined his examples with a mild
sarcasm. smiling at the same time
perhaps making it perfectly clear
that he wouldn't be overwhelmed by
bitterness.

‘ Capitalism. he explained. has

I asked him a loaded question:
whether'he therefore thought men
were inherently good and were only
kept from acting so because of the
present organization of society. He
eaplainedthatonce the major reason

2‘ for acting unjustly was removed (i.e.

capitalism) it would. still take
generations before people Would
treat each other fairly. but eventually
the most oppressive attitudes would

‘ be eliminated. In general it would be

an educational process under the
right conditions.

Dixon's convictions are supported
by such hopes and dreams. This it
the “Iirst time in history there is'tbe

possibility to provide for everyone." '

he said. Under thebestorganization
the needs of the entire world could be
met with everyone working just four
hours a day. Then there will be tithe
for people to become poets and
follow intellectual pursuits.
However. Dixon is motivated by

the worst fears as well. Capitalism. ._

he said. must survive on war. “There

can‘t be conventional wars in this.

mageddon at hand. the choice
be'comes“socialism or no humanity".

Dixon‘s case dl’owed‘thc' plethora

this cause: he must be a herald of _

great hopes while a prophet of
doom. is practical organizer while a
full-time philosoplter. (A salesman
too: according. to the socialist
newspaper. "l‘he Militant“. Dixon
was their top salesman of “prepaid
subscription cards“ for September.
Many of his "subs" were“hustled“ to
reporters and new photographers.)

Before Dixon left with a few
friends. I asked him whether he felt
optimistic about socialism‘s future.
“I'm optimistic.“ he said. “cause I
have no choice.“
