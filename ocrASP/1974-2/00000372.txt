election, that fund is expected to grow to cover the projeaed $40 million needed to run

Private contributions would be limited to only H.000, of which no more than 5100
could be cash contributions. In addition, Congress has established an Election Com-
 watchdog system to ensure. through the threat of court action. that the spen-
ding limitations are observed. The most crucial aspect of the bill is that for the ﬁrst
time. campaign linancingwill be paid in the most part by the public. by the people that
those candidates are expected to serve. The huge corporate interests. with their usual
unanny legal skills. will probably develop ways to circumvent the law. and exert
pressure on the candidata in any event. but they will now have to mart to overtly il-
legal methods to accomplish their task; The allegiance of the candidates will now be to

the people. where it should have always been and from where it never should have left. ,

Both parties are given the saute limit to spend -$20 million. which precludes the par-
ty in power from perpetuating itself simply because they have a greater revenue-
generating system. The $20 million rule works out to ten cents per citizen. an equitable
system when one considers the excess with which former Governor Rockefeller ran‘his
campaigns. The bill also allows for minor panics (that receive at least five per cent of
the vote) to receive the public funding a welL in proportion to the votes they received.
The bill extends to limitations on the spending in primaries and convention ﬁghts as
well. limiting a candidate to a total of no more than twice what that states‘ senator is

vallowal to spend. Much of a candidate‘s private contributions will be matched in full
by the public fund. If. f0: example. a Presidential candidate raised $5.000 in actual
twenty states. the public fund would match that $001!!) with an equal amount.
Primary spending would be limited to 5m million total. including money privately
raised from w'hatewr source.

[he‘fprovisions of the Congressional measure are already softened from their
original character. due in great part to the lhl’eatpf a Presidential veto. As it stands
now'. the bill is strongly deserving of support. and the signature of President Ford
would ob\iously be in the best interests of every voter in the nation. It was only a few
short months ago that appointed Vice-President Ford became appointed President
Ford. His tenure in ofﬁce isdue only to the fact that his predcwssor lead an irrepressi-
ble hunger for money, money that was obtained in many ass illegally. The Congress
deserts congratulations for an action. despite the disappointing delay. that is
desperately needed tozavoid any future Watergatu. any future embarrassments. any
future national disgra . '

There‘s No Place Like Home

Once again the makers of the free and the brave Big Mac come through. 0n the coat~
tails of Rocky‘s Supennall rides McDonald’s into the Hudson Park area to feed the
hungry Mall workers. What happened to thesubterranan restaurants they were going
to build? Perhaps the whole thing is a hoax. and we the unwitting participants in
another Cardiff giant scheme. Think positively. McDonald’s does not exist. Alas. that
doesn‘t work. We are playing “see no evil. hear no evil‘ that way. And above all we do
not play that game. We must wage war on McDonald‘s. Click your heels three times.
and say‘ rThere's no place for McDonald‘s...“

Thoughts On Checks and Balances

J 1

WASHINGTON— Sen. Lowell P.
\Veicker. .lr. (R-Conn.) thinks members of
Congress should make their ﬁnancial holdings
a matterof public record. Weicker has already-
done so. and last week he introduced legisla-
tion that would require the President. Vice
President. and members ofCongress to follow
suit.

In fact. the bill (5.4059lwould require every
federal employee in the executive and
legislath e branches who earns more than $30.-
000 a year to file an annual report listing all
assets and liabilities in excess of $1.500.

Not a bad idm. Sen. Weickcr. but good"

luck. You‘ll trad it. This year's campaign
reform legislation. which Senate and House
conferees finally agreed on a few days ago.
once contained similar provisions— con-
tained them. that is. until the conferees went
behind closed doors to hammer out at proposal
that would he agreeable to both sides.
Neddless to say. the dislosure provisions were
hammered Out all right: hammered right out
of the bill. in fact.

You see. it is difficult for a member of Con-
gress openly to oppose telling his constituents
where he keeps his money (and whom he
owes). beanie most people agree that the
public has a right to know whethe' an elected
repretentntive‘s votes are inﬂuenced by the
stocks he own or the creditors he owes. So the
ida it to vote for the proposal when the public
ts looking. but make sure theconfcrecs deep
gr II when they go behind closed doors to
cross the hst ‘t" and dot the last ‘i‘. (And my
goes it that if you write your representative
about what tuppated to the ﬁnancial dis-
closure provisions, he will respond. “It ain't
me. it's than.“ . '

That‘s why Weicker introduced his on Net
"filth Disclosure Act. a bill that will probably
put on the day Niagara Fella freezes over. At

Committee. and given the best of intentions 11
would be nearly impossible to hold hearings
and report the bill in this session.

So Weicker. according to an aide. “Ill

is occasionally used successfully to slip taut-1.1:

but only rarely works when to issue. lilt- mm

Sen. Warren G. Magnuson (D-\\'ush It» A
master at the technique. indeed. the nut-s n1
most of his bills end with the phrase "and 1m
