Wayne Berry,

by Guy Franks

Wayne Berry is yet another young
guitaerlaying song writer coming
from the Scuth trying to make it big
in the world of folk-rock music.
Walking in the footsteps of James
Taylor. John Prine. and numerous
others before himI he tries his hand
at gentle love ballads. songs which
evoke images of nature‘s beauty and
those which worship a better. lost
way of life. The latter. for him. scents
to best characterize the spirit of the
old South. Unfortunately. he adds
little to that which has already been
done in the field. and he and his
music may wellcnd up in anonymity.

His album is entitled Home A!
Lasl. from which one would get the
idat that Berry has been traveling
about the country and has returned
home where he belongs and where he
prefers to be. This would indeed
seem to be the case. asdcmonstratcd
in the first cut of the second side.
Dixie's' Pride. This might have been
a sensitive song. full of indignance
and pride. but Berry ruins any sym-
pathetic feelings which (he might
have evoked with blaring horns. una
necessarily loud backing vocals. and
a melody which. given half a chance.
could rival some of the songs at the
top of the AM charts.

But the second side seems to be

better than the ﬁrst. The next three
songs are soft pieces, reminiscent of
the great emotional storytelling in
Southern music. of special interest is
a song entitled Gene's Tune (Blotrrle
Guitar). wherein Berry describes his
youth and his fascination with Gene
Atrtry. both asa musician and a cow-
boy. The point is that Berry grew up
basing his dreams on images ofwhat

once was and is no more. That is the'

rough. cowboy way of life and the
music that was a part of it. it isu fan-
tasy based on forgotten truths. so
sad and I'ragilc.,He sings:

i always wanted a blonde guitar

i grew up dreamin‘ that I‘d own
one .'

But legends die and life just hits
you hard

'And dreams. it seems are
somehow always out of time

Least it‘s that way with mine.
His meaning comes through on this.
the best cut of the album.

The firs't side has five Songswhich.
when combined with the final song
of side two. comprisea group of very
ordinary melodies with few outstan-
ding features. He has a couple tear
jerkers about lost love. and happy
songs about love he didn't lose. But
on the whole. the words and music
all sound very much alike. They are

His backup music. while it is
nothing spectacular. is steady
enough tokeep the music respec-

been gained at the cost ol‘originality

Going Fast--Too Fast

by Neil Kenduclt

Hey there brother, what‘s goin‘ on?

I had to write to you for like time.
1 must pass on.

And remember me, dear bother.
like the time that passed as by -

The time we grasped in our young hands.
but now we must ask why;

Why we stand so far apart with me
so far behind;

Different as free man and slave:
the answer smites my mind.

For I am trapped in a web of fear.
which a needle sews for me;

And locked in a room with a bucking horse;
and the devil holds the key.

My life is a train on a pale fresh track.
headed toward a cold grave stone.

I'm going too fast and I can't slow down
'cause my will is no longer my own.

Living with trash in an underground tube
is all that is left of my lite;

As isit here alone staring blindly at fate.
my arm must concede to this knife.

And if ever perhaps I shall see you again.
it will only be a dream in my mind;

For it‘s'true that we do stand so far apart
with Being left far behind.
