 Checkmate}! ._  

by Jack tippal

The trouble started when black in-
advertently pushed a pawn to the
eighth rank and found that the pawn
had to be promoted. The general rule
that a pawn gains power as it ad-
vances had been obeyed. By the time
the pawn had reached the seventh
rank. he was more powerful than
most of block‘s pieces. But now on
the eighth rank, he had to be
promoted. There was nothing to do
but promote the black pawn to a
white knight! Why?

It seems that the game had not
been played according to all the
rules. This pawn had made several it—
legal moves during the game. In fact
black had planned several such ii-
icgai moves in an attempt to
checkmate white. The real trouble
began when several black pawns
were captured on passant al'tcr mak-
ing illegal moves. White noticed that
the moves had been illegal. but he
could not deduce which pieces had
moved illegally. The cx-puwn. now
turned white knight. in a repgntcnt
mood. had decided to set the record
straight. He told the white army
about thc illegal moves that black
had made. Enraged. whitc launched
a licrce attack. Mid-way through the
attack. the black queen was cap-
tured. 1n seems that the black quecn
had made several illegal moves even
before the game had started!)

However black. who was an
enthusiastic proponent of pawn
power. soon promoted one of his

pawns to a Queen. The coronation of
the new Queen brought a brief mo-
ment of comfort to the game and it'
appeared‘that a stalemate may have
developed. ' '

However it was soon discovered

that black had kept a secret record of, -

all the moves he had made (even il-
legal moves). White immediately
dcmanded to see the record: Black
refused. The matter was taken to the
Tournament Director to be resolved.
The T. D. however did not get to
decide this issue at the moment
because black had succeeded in cap-
turing the knight in charge ofbring-
ing the matter to the 'l‘.D.Enragcd
white promoted one of his pawns to
a knight and sent this knight on tl

mission to h ring the matter up before >
x.

the 'i'.l). Furthermore. white
protected this knight so that it too
could not be captured. And just to
keep black occupied. white launched
a mating attack on the kingsidc.

l'hc matter of the record was
brought to thc'i'.i).and itwnsdccid-
cd that the record had to be made
public. In four of being mated im-
mediately by whites mating attack.
black surrendered his record in an
attempt to reach an endgame that
may have had some strtlcmating
chances. Unfortunately for black.
the record was vcry clear that the
black King had also made illegal
moves and the mating attack was
almost completed. So. faced with it
forced matte. black resigned his King.

The black King had'resigned. and

theyQueen ascended ‘to the thione.

The Queeen (who had been‘
' promoted to that position by the old

King) decided that the game had
been so messy that the game should
end with the result that black be
granted a Bye for the game (which
counts as a win). Apparently black
escaped this game with a victory. (In-
cidentally the opening had been a
stonewall formation). Somehow
chess will never be the same again.
