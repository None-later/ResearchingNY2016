' You know when you‘re standing
in,front of the judge.rand he is about
to pass sentence. it all seems to be a
joke._lt doesn‘t really seem possible
that. this man is about to tell you
what is going to be done with a por-
tion of your life. Although this may
sound quite a bit far-fetched. it
stands to be true in many of today‘s
crime . indulgers. especially the
younger portion (ages l6-2l). The
seriousness of what has happened
doesn‘t surface in his mind until he
steps in his cell at the Elmira Reccp~
tion Center. Only then does the
reality of the long stretch of time
which he will be incarcerated begin
to affect him. When the judge said it.
he didn‘t make it sound like such a
long time. The personbecomes con-
fused. his mind is ﬁlled with a thou-
sand questions for which he has no
answers. When he gives up on the
questions bemuse he can‘t conceive
the answers. his mind rctrogrcsses
from the present to the past. He
begins to think about the days and
nights spent in the world outside.
precious memories! Then all of a
sudden, the amount of time he has
flushes through his mind. Hc
_rculizcs that he could be away from
the good free world outside forquitc
sometime. This. along with all the
questions for which he has no
answers becomes a very depressing
burden upon-his mind. In some
cases. a very weak minded person is
driven to his breaking point which
upon reaching he tries to “cut up". or
“hang up“. which are both very poor
means of attempting suicide. In
these cases. the person is so weak
minded. he is only looking at the
worst side ofthings. He feels that his

loss is so great that he could never
recover. However. he is not really
ready to leave this world. for if he
were he could find much more scverc
ways of attempting it. To him. his
attempt which is somehow ulwnys
foiled. is just a way of exemplifying

 
  
    

\

his depression. Once he has done so.~
he feels relieved of his burden. Coro-
mitting this act! also makes him feel
that he has gotten revenge on society
for putting him in the awesome
predicament he is in. lfit's not socie-
ty pressures. it’s the judge. his
mother. his father. had school con-
ditions or any number of other
things. The blame is always placed
somewhere else. This is a fantasy he
fabricates in his mind because he is
not yet man enough to accept the
fact that he. the one who held the
gun, or drove the car. or snatched the
purse. orwhatever the cause for his
being there. is the only one to be
blamed for his misfortune. Until he
is ready to accept the blame. any ef-
fort to reform. or rehabilitate this in-
dividual in my opinion. is hopeless. |
base my opinion on the simple fact
that you can‘t help someone until he
is willing to help himself. and a per-
son who feels he hasn't done
anything wrong doesn't feel he needs
to help himself. He will exploit any

efforts to help him because he is '

guiltlcss in his own eyes. He im-
murcs his mind completely and
creates and lives in a fantasy world of
his own. Everything becomes ajoke
again. But by and by. people who
came at the same time he did stan
making parole and he is still in. He
begins to deplorc what he is doing
and tries to find help. He converts
but the people who werc so willing to
help at ﬁrst are not the same. They
do not want to be bothered with a
person of his likes. Once again he
has come face to face with reality.
but once again it is too lute. Chances
are he will spend the rest ofltis life or
at least a major portion of it behind
penitentiary walls or bars. You see.
be projected :1 false image of himself
and unfortunately he will have to live
with it.
His Own Man

Incarceration hus runny effects on
people. lt makes some becomcquict
and withdrawn. It makes others
become loud and do things to try to
hccolnc lcndcrs when they don‘t rcul—
ly have the potential. while others
are dedicated followers from the
time they arrive until the timc thcy
depart. Something that is very rarely
seen is a person who is his own man.
one who doesn‘t do something
because everybody else does. or
won‘t do something because

'ev rybody

. tious. .They fear what otheri might
say. This is truenot only forpeople

who are incarcerated. but for people .

 

all over the world. Yet the peniten-
tiary is a very interesting place. You
know. the , dictionary defines
penitentiary as being a place of con-
finement or correction. That is a
very illusive definition. In all can-
dor. a penitentiary is a-place ﬁlled
with tension. fear. hostilities and in a
very camouﬂaged way it is invidious.
It takes a person who is incarcerated
a pretty good while to comprehend
what is happenning to him because
the penitentiary is also very in-
sidious. and the ways in which peo-
ple react to this is a very interesting
thing to observe.
inThe Crlmlnll Mild

All .of this put together in the
mind. poses one big question. What
motivates a person to commit a
crime‘.’ The answer. well a lot of
opinions have been given. those of
professional people and those of
common people. Nobody knowsthe
real answer because nobody is a
mind render. That‘s right. you can't
read the mind. Neither can you up-
praise a person by what he says or by
what he scores on any kind of test
and you can‘t make a sound judge-
ment on his character by the way he
acts in any given period of time.
Truthfully. I think the only time you
can pass judgement on a person is
when he passes from life to death.
Then you can say. well he was a
crook all his life. or whatever the oc-
casion culls for. So the qucstion.
what makes a person commit a
crime remains unanswered. at least
in my mind it does. Even so. any
crime. no matter what it is or who
has committed it. any crime is in no
way justifiable. even though lmysclf
have committed one.

Not a lot of people. if given the
chance to read this composition
would say it‘s preposterous. Maybe
you‘ve visited someone. saw the
front desk and visiting room ofajuil.
or maybe you‘ve even been on a tour
of the whole place. and it didn‘t look
too had. Well let me tell you that you
can never see an institution as it rcnl-
ly is as long as you're on the outside
looking in. l know because I'm here.
No doubt. to an outsider art institu-
tion may seem vcry comely. The

who bring with themselves and don‘t

of the people in these groups have

  

- two things in common. They try to

defy authority and they figure they
can beat the system. These two items
are the main factors in a small scale
war. The controlled versusthe con-
troller. Even though the controlled
side never wins. they never stop try-
ing. The correction officer is here
supposedly. to help the inmates.
which he finds difﬁcult and almost
impossible to do because to the in-
mates he is considered an illusive
adversary. Why? Simply because he
wears a uniform. and the uniform
represents authority. Here the mis-
understanding is created. The of-
ficer feels an inmate does something
or says somethingto him as a person.
This is not so. Confined in the in-
mate‘s r'nind is n hatred of such ex-

have that impression inculcated

lined quarters behind the peniten-
tiary walls create a very unstable at;

mosphere. So believe me when I say ,

that institutional environments are

get me wrong. Thereare a lot of peo-
ple who go through these changes

life. He emerges a substantially
better man than he was when he
entered. But there is still that
overwhelming percentage who are

not reached. They emerge from an I

institution with a more criminally in-
clined mind. That brings me to this
striking realization. Crime is here to
stay.
