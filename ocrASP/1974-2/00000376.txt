' fawn” to Hal Malniud‘s justiﬁed criticism

was eXtremely uncalled for. An apology was in
order as well as a realization that a mistake
was made. It is bad enough to be guilty of
racial ignorance, but the situation is inten-
sified by the defense of this ignorance. Hal‘s
reaction was on e of constructive criticism and
the response was merely a refusal to be
educated: -

‘. As to bringing in a dictionary definition.
nothing could be more absurd. Both the words
ﬁnegro” and "tidy" can be found also with
their traditional meanings. but no one would
be surprised at offense being taken at seeing
them used at this university. where people are'
supposed to be aware and sensitve. It is not the
dictionary~delinitions that are offensive. but
rather the connotations that go along with
these words. There are countless derogatory
and derisive words which could easily. and
happily. be dropped from our vocabularies
w“houtlosingttn iota ofcolor or rcdticing our
auilities to express ourselves.

" Accusing Hal of being an opportunist. hot
headed. and bitter, is reducing the situation to
that of name calling. He obviously has very
strong feelings on the matter. and through his
sincere caring is trying to‘omeliorutc a long
standing problem. Instead ofarguing against
his valid-point. why not get behind him and
face up to the responsibilities we all have?

More Protest

To the Editor:

In their responses to Hal Mulmud‘s letter.
-liorry Snndberg and the Inditttt Quad R.A.s
undeniably demonstrated our country‘s insen-
sitivity and indifference toward any problems
we cttn possibly overlook.

In referring the S'I‘li‘s light use of the word
“squaw.” Hal tried to show how derogatory
and destructive this term can bc. Besides cor-
rupting the Indian culture. the misuse of the
Indian language reinforces our inaccurate
views of these people and our contented
maintenance of these views. The use of
"squaw." in a time when Indians are
desperately trying to overcome their
stereotyped image. simply perpetuates our
misconceptions and defeats the Indians‘ goals.

Focusing on Hal‘s “hot-headed" attitudes
and "personal political ambitions." the
responders to his letter completely ignored the
Indians‘ point of view and the ideas Hal con-
veycd. The abuse of an Indian word was minor
but it highlighted our casual and reckless
manipulation of cultural symbols that we
neither understand nor care to understand. As

Caso’s Case

To the Editor: _

On Wednesday.0ctober 9. Ralph Caso.the
Republican candidate for Lt. Governor spoke
to a small group ofstudents hereut the univer-
sity. What he had to say was appa ' gto me.
anti lwould likcto mention some of nothings
that occurred for the beneﬁt oliiﬁll the
students. '

First ol' all the candidate spoke about the
State University system and told us (with a,
smile that made him look as if he hadjust had
an accident in his pants) that he could not
promise us that there would be no more in~
creases in tuition. In fact the present governor
has gone down on record as supportinga I00
percent increase in tuition at the State Univer-
sitics. It is also notable that Congressman
Hugh Carey has gone down on record suppor-
ting thc cottccpt ol' l'rcc tuition. and promising
at the very least no tnorc increases.

Mr. Cnso also told us that he intends to boil
full time Lieutenant Governor. This statement
is very interesting indeed coming from the run-
ning mate of Malcolm Wilson who in his oWn
l5 years as Lt. Governor managed to retain a
l'ul time law practice. rather titan full time
public service.

Finally. Mr. Caso attacked the Carey-ﬂ
Krupsak team for their “liberal-permissive“
stands. This attack is typical ofthc Republican
campaign. since both Mr. Wilson and Mr.
(.‘uso have found that thconlyttttucks they can
make on the Democratic ticket are of the
calibre of Mr. Wilson‘s statement which in
effect chalked ol'f voting l'or Ms. Krupsok as
nothing more than “voting fordirty books and
dirty pictures.“ In fact. Mr. (‘aso seems to only
be able to attack Ms. Krupsuk on false. sexist

 

‘ charges. at one point in the campaign alleging

‘lter to he gay. and therefore (to his point of
View) clearly not to be voted for.

The students of this university have not
been fooled by the glib doubletnlk and empty
promises they have received from the
Republicans. At the meeting with Case our
Student Association president. I’nt Curran.

~ stood up and gave a strong endorsement for
the Carcy—Krupsak ticket. That very same
night Central Council voted fora bill strongly
endorsing the two Democraticcandidates. In
an opinion pollconductcd at this university. -‘/4
of the students voiced their intention to vote
for (.‘ttrcy-Krupsuk. (Most of the rest were un-
decided.) Mr. Case told Put that we as
students should use the intelligence thttt got us
into this university in deciding for whotn to
vote. My answer to Mr. Cuso is that we
already have done so.

Whose Discrepancies?

To the Editor:

A little rebuttal in regard to the general
reaction denouncing the ASPs reportage of
the voiding of the SA commuter elections.
specifically SA President Pat Curran‘s Letter
the the Editor in 'I'uesday‘s ASI’(0ct. 8). In it.
he criticized the “shoddy journalism“ dis-
played in the article “Council Voids Some
Elections" (Fri.. Oct. 4) written jointly by
Mike Sena and Nancy Cook. Curran found it
"terriny disheartening to see so many factual
discrepancies." Indeed. there were factual mis~
takes. The nature of these were admitted and
explained on Tuesday‘s editorial page under
the heading "Err'ata“and can be summed up as
this: in regard to the commuter elections.
Curran invalidutcd them and not Central
Council as was reported.

l-Iowcvcg. C-urrup. in his letter. does not at-

.tack this Tuctual discrepancy. Instead. he

chooses as his focal point the treatment of Lin-
da Weinstock‘s role in the cancelled elections.
As acting election comntissiopcr. it was

Weinsiock‘s responsibility to properly oversee M

the elections. While not once denying the
veracity of the allegations served against
Weinstock. Curran disputes the handling of
the article by the ASI’s reporters. An
anonymous quote. a common journalistic
device. becomes a “totally unprofessional cut“
in Curran‘s interpretation. He says that
Weinstock should have been contacted for her
side of the story suggesting the record would
be set straight and her name cleared of all
allegations. I await Weinstoek‘s response.
The gist of Curran‘s letter. then. does not
dispute the factual accuracy of the article but
more 'the tough-minded journalistic sense it
exhibits. All too often run-of-the-mill. non-
committal —-«wishy-washy. shall we say. jour-
nalism predominates the pages of the ASI’. I
applaud the critical journalism of Send and
"Cook" and contend Curran‘sability to question
it seriously. Good journalism should elicit
response from its readers. The response.
however. should not attemptto censure the
reporting that caused it. It‘s about time the
ASP stirred some controversy.

Cancer Concern.

To the Editor:

This is in response to Steve Baboulis‘:

column in the October 8 edition of the ASP

At first. Ialso wondered why the press sub- 1
jectcd Betty Ford's cancer operation to so _
much public discussion. But then Iheurd and .
read in a couple of places. including Time '

magaline and thc“Today Show“thttt it was
Ms. Ford‘s conseious decision to publicize the
operation in the interest of those who would
thus be promplcd to get a breast cancer ex-
amination. Marcella Buyh wasthc firstpromi-,
ncnt woman to be so public about a mastec-
tomy. although she didn‘t get quite the atten-
tion Betty Ford got.

I think Ms. Ford did a genuine service.

Remember: breast cancer affects I out of I5 1

women over the age ol'40. That‘s a lot of pea-
pic. A lot of people you know personally. If

detected curly. it is curable. If not. it‘s a killer, if
The publicity around Ms. Ford's operation .

aims to invade one life in order to savc‘
thousands of lives.

Flu New

To the Editor: '

There has been considerable misinforma-
tion as to the need for Flu shots by various
segments of the campus. It would be helpful if
the campus could be advised that at this point
there has been no general recommendation for
Flu shots for anyone other then individuals
over 65 or those with a basic health problem.
By basic health problem is meant a severe
respiratory disease such as emphysema or
serious asthma. a heart problem. diabetes. or
other such problem as would render the Flu an
unusual risk for that individual. Students on
campus who feel that they have such problems
should contact the Stttdcnt Health Service
about the question of Flu shots. and others on

- campus such as facultyand staff should confer

with their private physicians. If there is a

change in this basic policy it will be an-
nounced.
