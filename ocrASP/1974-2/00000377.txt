_ s It all began last April when a place on Hud-
zson Avenue caught our attention. We‘sought

"out the landlord. and started talking...

The ' rooms would be fully furnished.
although wewereexpected to provide our own
beds. lamps. drawers and desks. This seemed

‘reasonable enough.

She asked if we would be wanting doors on
our respective bedrooms. and upon our afﬁr-
mative reply started adding on to the basic-
5375 rent figure. We got kinda pissed about
this and after much haggling got her to throw

' in two of the doors free. Sometimes you have

How many times have you known the per-
son who emptied out the ﬁre extinguisher in
your ball. yet you didn't say anything aboutit?
How many times have you seen someone

, tampering with the ﬁrealarrn. and just turned
your head away? And how many times have
you sat by in utter frtltration whilea drunken

the suite. or something init. leaving you and

- the rest of your suite-late! to. foot the bill?

If you answered “only once" to any of these
questions. that's once too often. Multiply your

done to remedy

Believe it‘oi‘ not'tand hopefully there are ‘

some who will believe it). there is something
that can be done about these situations. Grab
hold of your rights and take your information
. to the Judicial Quad Board. known formally
as the Quadrangle Judicial Committee. The
Committee members are the people to second
talk to. ‘
A  ‘ is set up by each residence
quadrangle and directs its attention speciﬁcal-
ly to those acts that cannot be tolerated

because they interfere with the processes of the 1

community or with the members of the com-
munity. But the Board can't focus its attention
on these acts if-it doesn‘t know about them. It‘s
our responsibility to let the Board know. The
Judicial Board is trying to work for us and

' The. processes used by the Judicial Board

follow due process of law and allow both sides ,

reach a fair decision. These hearings are not
considered formal legal trials and all matters
are kept appropriately confidential.

There is something to be learned whether a
