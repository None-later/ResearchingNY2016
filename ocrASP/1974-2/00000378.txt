As all fairy tales begin, once upon a
time there lived in Albany a person.
This person came to Albany on a cold
September morning to bring some
warmth to an old, tired town. As this
man entered the sleepy town byway of
the Northway a sound was heard down
the -Western Avenue. The Popula'ce
shoute, “Kalimba Mon!" Not in unison,
mind you, since it would be difficult in-
deed for the entire population of such
a town togat itall together at once. But
that' didn't matter much, because
Kalimbb' Man had come, comewith the
promise of his magic boxes. The
magical musical boxes that even the
lowliest peasant could pluck. $15
