Who needs non-conference games
anyway? The Great Dane Varsity
baseball team certainly doesn't!
AfteL dropping their seventh eon-
seeutive non-SUNYAC game to
Sierra on Wednesday 8-0. the Danes
saw their fall “exhibition” record ter-
minated at no wins-seven losses.

_ Fortunately. the loss did not
blemish the Danes‘ b-l Conference
state. But it was no ointment for
Coach Burlingume‘s complexion.

frequent srarting assignment. as

coming Ooeonta games. Bicber.

did not pitch as badly as the score
might indicate. A few seeing-eye
base hits. as well as his consistent in~
ability to get the big out. were the
main contributors to the righty‘s
downfall.

Siena got off to a quick start in
the very ﬁrst inning. as they scored
the only run their mound corps was
to need. A leadofl‘ single. a stolen
base. and two ﬂy balls and it was all
over. The Danes appeared to have
something going in their half when

l’oulﬁelson drew a one-out walk
and took off on a hit-and-run play
with lilnir at the plate. However.
'l‘ont lofted a short fly to left and a
hurried throw doubled Nelson off
first on a close play. That play was
only the beginning of the Danes'
woes. but it set the tone for the rest of
the ballgame.

The second inning saw a glimmer
of hope as Iiieber got the lndians in
order. including a strikeout. Unfor‘
tunntely. the glimmer turned out to
be just a flash in the pan as it was to
be the only l-2-J frame that Karl
would turn in. Vic Giulianelli then
smashed a one—hop shot to the fence
good for two bases leading off the
Dane second.but was left stranded as
Ciofﬁ got the next three without
allowing a ball to reach the outﬁeld.

runs: a one-out Walk to Plunkett.
