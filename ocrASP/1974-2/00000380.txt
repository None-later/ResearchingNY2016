" The segregated porkan system ls ‘I

“farthcorntng tn the ivory '

near future." 

by Mlltc Sena

The contemporary maxim that
students are the new niggers of the
World has again been validated With
the reinstatement of reserved park-
ing for both faculty and staff.

Vice l’rc dent for
fairs Lewis We lch has been forced to
revert to last year‘s reserved parking
system because of an agreement
worked out between the United Un-
iversity Professions (L‘ UP) and the
Governor's .0 c of Employee
Relations.

Assistant VlCL l’re dent of Un-
iversity Affairs Sorrell Chesin said
that the segregated parking system is
“forthcoming in the very near
future.“ All that is lacking is the Ad-
ministrative get-ahead. '

Student Association leaders
believe that last year‘s University
Senate decision to have first-come.
first-served parking should be bin-
ding because the Senate is the “duly-
elected" campus governing body.

The controversy started fourteen
months ago when a student parking
strike initiated by Central Council
led to the Senate‘s decision.
Under the previous system r
students were relegated to the rear of
the State and Dutch lots. commuters

and staff had the section closet! to

State and Dutch were the only paved
parking lots on the quads.

Through a complicated network
of‘ appeals. members of the UUI’.
onal
Associ' ion (SPA). filed a grievance
to have the reserved s stem
reinstated.

the union contended that open
parking violates part of their State-
SI’A Agreement ’ eunion explain-
cd that open parking diminishes and
impairs a “benefit or privilege"
provided them by law without “prior
notice of SPA."

The Senate Professional
Associaion. under the terms of their
contract. appealed the University
Senate‘s decision to President
Benezet‘s office. The SUNYA Presi-
dent designated Assistant Viee Presi-
dent of University Alairs Sorrell
Chesin to be in charge of the appeal.

Chesin found SPA‘s grievance in-
valid. e explained that the faculty‘s
right to parking had not been im-
paired because members could still
have access to the same parking lots
as before. '
