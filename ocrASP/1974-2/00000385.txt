n the first hour I rolled into an
I elevator just before it closed.
Two Frat men fell silent inside as
Ientered. I began to turn around so that
I could leave going forward but had
some difficulty. I smashed the
wheelchair against the wall once or
twice and rather spastically backed
into the door cursing the vehicle. I
didn't think much of the whole
process—after all, it was my first hour.
But the expression on their lacesl If
they could have squeezed through the
corner crack they would have. I tried to
smile at first, but their shock and tear
and embarrassment and complete in-
ability to handle the situation made me
very serious. I wheeled out of the
elevator quickly; they didn’t leave until
I rounded a nearby corner . . . . . . .
Their eyes were full of fear. They
were scared of me. -
I was a little scared of Mike, too. You
don't look at wheelchair people in the
eye; you simply cannot do it. They are
somehow less than human, their dis-
ability seems so immense, their hap-
piness so doubtful. 'And I, for the first
time felt this from the other side.

I stopped a girl on the podium and'

asked her to wheel me from the Bio
building to Administration. it was night
and she was extremely uncomfor-
table. She wished I hadn't asked,
breathed heavily all the way, and left
me at full speed when we got there.
She uttered not aword whileshe rolled
me, but made some noises when I
started conversation. I stopped talking
after a few seconds because I was get-
ting embarrassed.

the Co-Chatrman of Awareness Day.
He was kind enough to obtain for me a

wheelchair the day before Awareness'

Day. (Before, so people wouldn't-thinkl
wasn‘t really handicapped). Spending
a day in a wheelchair was an idea that
had been mulling about in my mind for
a few weeks. [was walking through the
Campus Center from one unimportant
place to another when I saw Mike, in
his wheelchair, sitting behind the
Awareness table taking names of peo-
ple who might want to spend Thursday
in a wheelchair and thus learn
something about how it feels. I went up
Without identifying myself as an ASP
editorand asked fora chaira day early.
A girl (not in a wheelchair) behind
Marc responded:

"Well, you can always rent one." She
didn't say it nicely. Mike didn't say
anything but I couldn't stand being
treated like a normal student any
longer so I identified myself, and was
soon assured that I'd get a wheelchair
a day early. '

"We need the publicity," said Mike.

l've been carsick, airplane sick and
just plain sick sick. But never
wheelchair sick. The constant vibra-
tion through the chair took some get-
ting used to.

The hill from the entrance to State -

Quad to the podium was the steepest.
"Where are any hills, much less steep
ones. on this campus?" you ask. Well, I
found these slopes while wheeling the
chair from Mike's suite on State to mine
on lndian and realized they become
important factors in that most obvious
wheelchairism: Getting around is
tough. About half the wheeling
students on campus have $1500
battery-driven mechanisms that power
the chairs. But there are other
problems.

I How do they piss? Can they visit the
third floor of an elevatorless dorm?
Can they have sex? And there’s eating,
putting posters on the wall, falling out
of the chair. ..

Well, rest assured: They can piss.

Every bathroom I've entered that was_

built in the last ten years has one stall
for the handicapped with a bar 'built
into the watt 1 don't ever remember
commenting or even momentarily
pondering the fact that some people
have to use it. Believe me, they are
useful!

Sex is a little harder. People have
trouble relating to wheelchairs with
people in them. (They might have more
luck if they tried relating to people in

’41:. F

' wheelchairs.) Yet there are a few who I

can relate and there do exist suites with
wheelchairs that occasionally produce
a bag of empty beer cans and a few

(hours of laud music.

\ As I rolled around ,campus those
who knew me would ask if I were hurt;
those who really knew me understood _
immediately. Those who i knew only
illghtly didn't know me in the ohair.‘A
guy who lives down the hall and I pass-
ed alone on the podium with nothing
but pillars and windows and he avoid-
ed the gaze of this handicapped per-
son, this wierdo, this cripple.

*

A friend's friend asked: “Can I ride-
it?" '
i got out of the chair, something I
hadn't wanted to do but before the
twenty-four hours were up I had done it
more than once. I live on the third ﬂoor
of an unelevatored dorm and had to
' leave.Also. on Indian the tower
basement-cafeteria route is blocked by
Henway's, and I just gave up and walk-
ed down. (I was told more than once
that lcould wheel to Dutch! Yeah, well I
could do it for a week andkeep my eyes
closed the whole time for that matter.)
A week in a wheelchair! My, what a
huge sacrifice. Did you know that some
people dd it their whole lives.

She asked if she could ride the
wheelchair. A few more asked for this
small indulgence and wheeled about
with glee. What an exciting toy!

Hmmm. ,

Once I switched, with difficulty, into
a regular chair without noticing a few
amusing ASP editors hiding the
wheeler. [didn't remember I should be
in it, walked down the hall and was
genuinely shocked when asked it I had
"forgotten something." How soon we
forget . . . when we can.

I’ve been carsick,
. airplane sick and
justplainsicksick.
