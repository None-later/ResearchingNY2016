membership of Greek organizations is
rapidly declining: In order to simply fill
up the sections once dominated and
totally populated by trats, the groups
have resorted to allowing in-
dependents to live among them.

instinct For Survival

From reading letters to the editor
written by members of Greek
organizations, it is fairly simple to
arrive at the conclusion that a
member of y a frat cannot critically
evaluate his role' on campus. The
superlatives intertwined in a letterirom
a frat member cloud the fact that much
of what he boasts about, or complains
about for that matter, bears a certain.
measure of truth. Unfortunately, each
time a brother responds to a criticism,
he winds itup bvtinadvertently (to give
him the benefit of the doubt) asking us
to join. It is the instinct for survival, for
Greek organizations, both fraternities
and sororities, are fast disappearing
from the face of the campus.

In the frat section of Schuyler Hall,
Dutch Quad, the brothers .of Theta Xi
Omega are holding a rush function,
complete with "beer and breads.” The
typical, mythical frat party is un-
derway, and anyone who enters con-
vinced that frat members are loud,
drunken, beer-guzzling, and women-
chasing uncouth slobs will leave
smugly reassured of their belief.

There are two large speakers hang-
ing from the third floor ledge. The
restraining links of hardened chains
wrapped around the steel supporting
fence on the third floor prevent the two
heavy boxes fromdepositing their con-
tents on the second floor. Most hours of
any given day, the chains don't have a
very demanding job, as their captives
present themselves as very meek and
unresisting prisoners. It is during these

   
 
   
 
 

    

hours that appearances, as they are
notoriously wont to do, mislead the.
casual eye.

Stereotypically Nondescript

On this hypothetical night, however,
those chains are being strained to their
limit. The drone of the nondescript
s p e a k e r s ,
stereotypically nondescript member of
the frat, is deafening.

For the uninitiated, rush function is

an attempt by a frat to recruit new *

members. With other types of
organizations, such a recruitment
process will take on different forms,
such as a rally, alecture, a formal
dinner, or, in the case of the recruit-
ment to attend this university, an
application and competition. With a
frat, a rush function is almost ex-
clusively a party involving some sort of
liquor (often beer, but recently tequila
sunrises or wine and cheese) and a
group of women, (usually a sorority,
but often enough a general population
of women on the quad).

As long as there have been frater-
nities theprevailing view of frats has
been that of beerand women, and here
they are playing up to the very
stereotype that they will most
vehemently deny. Ask V any frat
member what his frat is all about and
you will be told: "A frat is an academic,
service and social organization
designed to better the lives of the un-
iversity community." That blurb is so
automatic that it is reliably reported
that Potter Club has its members-to-be
sit naked on a block of ice and repeat
their impression of a frat‘s mison d’etre.

itiatees out into the middle of the quad

Are Rushees Masochists?

On the surface they are exactly what
their detractors like to claim, and then
some. Yet despite its problems, the
fraternity life on campus continues,
and with some groups, such as TXO,
still thrives. What makes them tick?
Are rushees masochistic?

Paddles Of The Past
Preserved through the ages, the in-
scribed paddles of past and present
brothers adorns the fence on the third
floor of Schuyler. Ranging back to a
graduate of 1970, paddles bearing all
manner of artistic design grace the frat
section. Each paddle bears the inscrip—
tion of the frat, either through its name
only, or through an intricate artwork of
its Opal of arms. In fact, there are so
many reminders thata'frat section is in-
deed a frat section, that it would be

BOSY to wonder it the frat has a
‘collossal, collective indentilicalion
‘ problem.

In Schuyler Hall, for example, the
entire south wall of the TXO section is
emblazoned with the coat of arms of
TXO. Half of it is done in dayglo paint.
Beneath that, also in dayglo are two
block prints of the letters, T-X—O. In ad-
dition are the thirty or so paddles each
bearing the initials of the frat.

Remarkably enough, the members
of the frat refuse to blend into an all-
encompassing, almost omnipotenf

their individuality. It would be easy
enough to classify the men of Potter

would be equally simple to classify the
men of TXO in a somewhat similarl
manner, except that you would be do-
ing yourself an injustice.

3.3 And Rising

With such an overbearance of overt
attempts at assimilating into "The Frat,"
it would be strange to assert that each
of the men of TXOis'anindividual uni-
que as each independent is unique
and maybe even'more so. The average
index of the TXO section is 3.3 and ris-
ing. Majors range from English to
Biology to Political Science. lnterests
range in equal numbers to the
membership of the frat. Not all of the
frat members are the "brothers" they
would like to pass themselves off as be-
ing. Not few of them are almost un-
welcome in the section, and some
others have strained relations.

The overwhelming majority
however, enjoy disproportionately
good relations with their neighbors, es-
pecially when taken in comparison
with an all-independent section.

Malcolm Putow, one of three rush
masters this year, said of independent
halls, "I‘ve never been so proud of liv-
ing in the frat as when I went around
distributing invitations to our formal
rush functions. These places were a
pig sly. They looked worse than our
section after our messiest party."
Purow, though he speaks obviously
with a vested interest, reflects much of
the opinion in the frat. The internal
organization of a frat such as TXO is
what keeps the section clean, and
keeps the hierarchy functioning,
Between the members, the three rush
masters, the rotation of party respon-
sibility, and the traditional president,
vice—president and treasurer, the work
of the group is divided sufficiently.

Chaos Vs. Organization

Independent life is chaotic. Frat life
is organized. Where independent life is
without direction, frat life has a goal, its
perpetuation. Where independent life
is unstructured, frat life has a founda-
tion. Where independents have rigid
impressions of Greeks, frat brothers
have equally rigid impressions of in-
dependents.

Bob Golian is the captain of theTXO
football team. Like most of the rest of
the frat, he is a junior, and he has
definite views of life outside the frat.
"When a bunch of independents have
a food fight, everybody says, 'What the
hell, it'sa food fight,’ butwhena frat has
a food fight they say, 'Look at those
animals, it figures a frat would behave
like a bunch of pigs.’ It's ridiculous, we
have to behave better than the average
student." Purow added, "Now that’s a
double standard."

lairne Soto is a sophomore. He is the
only Puerto Rican member of the frat
and is on the Educational Oppor—
tunities Program. Even more than his
brothers, laime takes his academic life
seriously, "Life on E.O.P. is pretty
'tough, like you know, in your senior

e .
year E.O.P. stops payingyour way
through school. That's when most of us

i on the program have to quit. Man, it's
tough." Living with the frat, for Soto, is ,

far quieter than independent life.
You Can Count On The Guys
lim Black isa freshman,and he is not
in the frat. But he'wants to be. He is from
Holland Patent, New York, between
Utica and Rome. "1 want to be in this
frat because it seems to be a place
where you can count on any of the
guys for a favor. You know what'l
mean?" As part of the rigamarole con-
nected with joining the frat, Black
attended all the rush functions and the

invitation~only informal and formal

events. So far, they have all been

liquor-and-women parties, a fact.

whichmay never have occurred to the
rushee.
Women Not Used As Lure

De Govanni defended the practice.
"We want people to come to these
events. No one will come if there isn't
any booze or women." Chauvinistic?
No, for he doesn’t think’ot it in those
terms. Womenaren't used as a lure to
attract horny males into captivity,
"booze—a nd-broads" parties are the

way things always have been, and-

DeGo'.anni., a conservative to begin
with, is not about to tamper with the
rule of the past.

Some of the other brothers have
suggested holding rap sessions with
rushees, to get to know them better.
Other suggestions included holding a
football game, or a keg while watching
a televised gameThe purpose, aslerry
Albrecht put it, is to get to know the
men that might be in the frat one day.
This he admits, is impossible with the
speakers blaring and the taps running
in a crowded lounge half filled with

Frats have had an assigned. task

which they have carried out without in-

terruption. STB has traditionally been

the one .involved most heavily», in

school politics. Central Council Vice- .
Chairperson Eric Klein is from STB, for

example. Most of the members of

Colonial Quad's Quad Board have

been from STB and the now defunct

GDX. .APA and Potter Club have

always been the backbone of the Dane

varsity teams, with most of Potter hav-

ing key roles in the successful season

the Dane football team has enjoyed so

far. Rudy Vido, SUNYAC wrestling

champion, all-star track and field man

and defensive lineman on the Danes

typifies the Potter Club legend. A

member of TXO has been the business

manager of many Student Association

funded groups for the past ten years.

The business manager of the ASP has
been an inherited position for those

years. Les Zuckerman is business
manager of the Torch, \Viewpoint,

Photo Service, Inter-Fraternity Council
and the ASP. Last year's. business
manager, lerry Albrecht, is this'year’s
Student Association Comptroller.
"And the beat goes on..."

At eleven o'clock that night lheenor-
mous speakers were silent, victim of
the drainage of the kegs. The women
had left and the few straggling rushees
were winding up their introductory
sessions with their potential brothers.
The rest went off to sleep. De Govanni
called after them, “You're coming to
the beer party on Saturday night at
Mohawk campus? It's a bring-your-
own-date affair." "Sure," one of the
faceless voices replied, "sure." He dis-
