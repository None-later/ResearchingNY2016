The play was’an experience i en-
joyed: finding the Arena Theatre was
an experience i didn‘t enjoy. I spent
20 minittes- walking through the
building; up to the third floor. down
to the basement. The people I asked
looked at m’e‘with blank looks and
just shrugged their shoulders. Final-

. ly'l latched onto two other lost souls

and westu'mbled acgoss the Arena
Theatre. Entering the Arena i found
a small intimate theatre-in-the-
round with seating for about 250
people. There were 50 people'with
me who seemed to enjoy the
Improvisation as much as I did.

The set tvus plain: a table strewn
with crumpled paper. three chairs.
and. a couch. At first I thought the
costuming was plain. when Len

entered in blue jeans and a work
shirt. This observation was proven
wrong when David Wolff. Joyce
Farra. and Tim Johnson. as

on a costume consisting of a shabby
dress and hobby sax.

The show about loncseo hiselfwas
very well doite. Barry Katz. the

kept moving so that the audience
didn‘t feel as though all they saw ere

. Four Letter Words ‘ '
And Lenny Bruce- ‘

by Paul Pelegelll

I frequently use four letter words
which are labelled Obscenities.
Sometimes they‘re longer than four
letters. For some reason most of my
friends use words like these to make
their language splcicr. Many people
employ obsccnitics as part of their
everyday vocabulary No one is real-
ly shocked attymorc to hear the word
"luck" or similar expressions. The
tltcatcrand movies have adopted
realistic language and even T.V. has.
One group of people who have long
been allowed to make obscenities
part of theiract are night-club com~
cdians. However. in the early 60's
the courts ndccidcd- to -.draw the
line somewhere.

Lenny Bruce happcncd to be at
this somewhere Most of us know he
was a comedian who used vulgarities
as the basis of his act. He was
arrested many times and died in I964
of an overdose of heroin. Not so
many of us have heard one of his
routines or know the circumstances
of his life just before his death.

Lunch Mandarin Style

by Srindy Ellenhogen
and Mellsse Ceust

The Peking Restaurant offers a
wide range of dishes prepared in the
Mundtirin style of Chinese cooking.
Mandarin differs from Cantonese in
that noodles are the staple rather
than rice. Wheat is found in abun-
dance in northern China. Marco
Polo introduced spaghetti to ltaly
upon his return from the Orient.
Mntidarin also employs hotterspices
than Cantonese: chili peppers.
scallions. curry. and str unisc: these
arc felt to have medicinal powers. In
addition to the stir-fried foods com-
mon in Cnntoncsc cooking (c.g. fried
rice. chow nicin. popper steak). cold
dishcs, inlcrcstitig soups. long-
cookctl means. and Cnsscrolcs are
popular. We recently sampled a
rcprcsenlativc selection of Mandarin
dishes at the Peking and found the
restaurant to be generally un-
interesting.

A typical cold dish is pickled cab-

bage (75:). When properly prepared
this spicy dish is anything but cold.

however here it tasted like slightly-

over-peppered cole slaw.

3 Assorted Flavors

Next we tried a promising Three
Assorted Flavors Dclicacy soup
($2.50 for 2). To our dismay. we
received a tasteless broth accented
with some strips of ham.
wintcrmelon. and a third equally
non-descript "delicacy." One good
note. however. was the noodles
which accompanied the soup. They
were freshly fricd. crisp. and
delicious. This started the inevitable
dippingol'noodlcs in tltcduck sauce.

Main dishes run about $4.00
apiece. btit since dishes should be
eaten family style. it is often possible
to share dishes,and combine with
soup to bring down tltc price. We
sampled the sweet and sour pork
l’eking stylc ($3.50) but were disap-

pointed to ﬁnd a carbon copy of the
Cantonese version. it was satisfac-
tory but lacked distinction.

Curry chicken ($3.75) was a large
portion of chicken in a fiery curry
sauce. We were pleasantly surprised
by this and decided that we had not
given the restaurant a fair chance.
Therefore we returned and sampled
beancake casserole ($4.50). which
someone had recommended to us.
The casserole consisted of soup with
beancake and Chinese cabbage and
although very generously ﬁlled. very
disappointingly bland. Bean cake. a
soybean product which is light
brown and of a jcllicd texture. does
not look appctiling. its flavor is in-
nocent. however and a suitable
supplement to more strongly
flavored foods. litit in this case it was
the mttin attraction. and as a result
the casserole tirade a poor showing.

Moo Shoo l’tirlt

Our final try was moo slioo pork
($2.95). a stir-fried mixture ofshrcdd-
ed pork. vegetables and egg. spread
with scallions and peppers. It is
iraditiomilly served with thin pan-
cakes-( I So each) adollop ofthe mix-
ture is placed on the pancake. which
is then rolled up and eaten. The Pck-
ing version relicd much too heavily
on soy sauce. whichdrowucd ottt the
llavors of the various other inv
grcdienls.

'l‘hc Peking offers it somewhat
better buy at lunch. A sclcctcd
number of dishes are offerth at
significant savings. e.g. chicken
curry at $2.50. and the food is
generally more carefully prepared.

Shanghai Better

believe the Shanghai.(799 Central
Avenue) which we reviewed
previously offers more taety and
authentic food.
