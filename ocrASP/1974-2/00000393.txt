An; amendment to the Education
Act of, l965,isponsored by,Conser-
vative Sen. James Buckley of New
York. gives college students access to
their own files. includinghigh school
and college personal recommen-
dations. For students who haven't
reached I8. the same rights are
transferred to their parents. The law
goes into effect November 20. —

The material open to student in-
spection includes everything in his or

academic work completed; level of
achievement. including grades and
test results; attendance data; interest

_ Requests to see the material must
be honored within 45 days. .

Students may'then request a hear-

records and to request deletion of
“inaccurate. misleading. or
otherwise inappropriate data con-
tained therein."

The law furthermore forbids third

agencies—access to student records.

shudders Drawn

The Buckley amendment has
drawn shudders from most college
administrators who envision
bureaucratic overload and serious
ethical and practical problems in
regard to students‘ letters of
recommendation.

“Letters of recommendation may
tend to be worthless if faculty know
that students may read them." com-
mented Charles Whitlock. Dean of
Harvard College. “There will be a
tendency for them not to be as
honest as they were previously.” he
said.

LONDON (AP) One year ago Thursday the oil producing liilllttns began
teaching the rest of the world an expensive lcSSon that could change the
economic facts of life forever—the era of cheap oil is over.

Beginning on Oct. l7. I973. the Arabs and their partners in thc ()rgnni/ii-

quadrupling the price of oil in less than to weeks.

Rich and poor nations alike still reel from that move.

Republlean Wayne Wagner clslmed as he spoke In the ballroom.

by Edward Maser

On Wednesday a‘ scheduled
debate between the two . Con-
gressional candidates for the Albany
area came to naught when the in-
cumbent. Democrat Samuel Strat-
ton. failed to appear at the Campus
Center ballroom. Republican
Wayne Wagner. the challenger.
stayed on to answer questions.

Stratton. who also did not show
up at a previous discussion in
Colonic. left word that he liiid been
“called back to Washington.“

Wagner attacked his opponent‘s
absence. saying that “running
against Stun Stratton is like cam-
paigning against the wind.“ He
called attention to his experience iii
economic affairs (Wagner is a
banker ttnd has fought business at
Buffalo State).

Wagner. explaining his program

In addition to fiscal 'matters
Wagner talked about voter apathy.
He noted the sparse attendance
(about forty people) at this par-
ticular talk and at the campus visits

of (iovemor Wilson and Hugh-

Carey. “I urge you to become in-
volved in politics. no matter what
your opinions are." Wagner explain-
ed.

The candidate cume‘out against
both forced busing of school
children and wage and price con-
trols. “They‘ve been tried before and
they don‘t work.“

He also attacked governmental
red tape. “The federal government
spends two billion dollars it you on
paper alone."

The talk was enlivened near the
end by the quips of Political Science

posed to help moderate the debate.

He told me tiiorc women prevail in
the teaching department and that
they‘re more “inclined to work with
children." He added. “They can
become interpreters if they wish.“

Marking System

I asked the two students about
their marking system at the Moscow
Institute.

The grading system is not too
different from ours lll Albany
l'chcrcdnik said. Usually students
take an exam. or what be called ti
"performance test." at semester‘s
end. Alex added. when students tttkc
illt exam it‘s usually “fttcc-to-l‘nce
with the teacher." i.c. close observa-
tion is maintained.

Language courses are "checked
very often in English." l’ctrov said.
There are frequent quizzes. its well.
l’ctrot also noted till the exchange
students were "given a proficiency
test hcrc“ prior to placement in
litnguzigc courses.
