__ g . I ustit'iable indictments of the 6f Attica brothers."
began Derrick-'Morrison.-Socialist,Workers‘ Party candidate for governor.
 . ...Mortipo‘n continued to criticize his opponents. voicing a radical platform
before'the small on-campus gathering sponsored by the Young Socialists
Alliance. ' ' .
Morrison declared Carey and Wilson “unfit to deal with the problems we
‘ face. Both these candidates are backed by the corporations which brought
you the energy crisis and inﬂation.” He accukd both parties of “cloaking and
._. concealing the real- issues by pointing to non-issues." _
If elected. Morrison says he will help people deal with inflation by raising
j wages. pension and welfare beneﬁts to meet rising costs. He also proposes a
: 30-hour work week and a five dollar minimum wage.

Morrison dislikes present policies which “urge the people to tighten their
belts." He believes it is the proﬁt system which is to blame for the present
economic situation. Instead of the government‘s “curtailing the
lifestyles of the majority." Morrison would like to see the system reformed.

A student. majoring in economics. labeled: Mor rison's economic solutions
absurd during the question and answer period. The student wanted to know
how Morrison could advocate reforms that would “surely result in galloping
inflation." Morrison countered with numerous examples of big business‘
abuse of the people. If these corporations refuse to help their employees meet
rising costs. Morrison insists they audit their books publicly and let the peo-

‘ ple see why. People must know “that this whole insane system has to be over-
turned.“ says Morrison.

‘I would toss out all indictments against the Attica Brothers“
Morrison says the state wishes to appear victimized by criminals when in
reality the criminals are being victimized by the state. Hewants to abolish the
present penal system.

Morrison. former writer for the socialist weekly Militant. is launching his
campaign primarily to educate the people to a Socialist alternative. He says
the people he encounters at his street rallies are interested because they have
realized that both Democrats and Republicans are guilty ofdeceitful prac-
tices.

Thirty thousand signatures got Morrison on the ballot. Looking at the ﬁf-
tccn SUNYA students in CC I I who came to hear him speak he commented
that from what he'd heard. he‘d drawn more people than Ralph Caso did in
the Campus Center Ballroom. ‘

Reaching Out ForMSfMoney

Campus Chest is gone. “Reaching Out Week" has taken its place. This
year. Multiple Sclerosis twill be reaching out to the SU NYA community Oc-
tober 2| through 25. The week is being sponsored by Special Events Board.
whose members hope it will become a new tradition at S U N YA to replace the
old tradition of Campus Chest.

Every day next week. f/rom 9 a.nt. to 2 p. m.. a table will be set up in the CC
lobby. Students will be manning the tables. asking fordonations in exchange
for free coffee and tea for the week. band-made candles. candy. cookies and
brownies baked by members of the local Multiple Sclerosis chapter. and
roses. carnations and pom-poms donated by the Capital District Florist
Association. In addition. two week-long contests will be held. with prizes
awarded to the winners at thcend ofthe week. The International Film Group
is showinga movie thisweekend. donating their proﬁts to Multiple Sclerosis.

The disease. Multiple Sclerosis" . affects the central nervous system. and is
olten called the great crippler of young adults. It results in deterioration of
the nerve coverings. leading to such problems as slurred speech and paralysis
ol arms and legs. conditions which worsen as the disease progresses. It most
oltctt afflicts people in their early 20‘s ttnd 30‘s.

All the monies collected by Special Events Board will go to the Capital Dis-
trict Chapter of the National Chapter of Multiple .Sclcrosisr, which now
serves 12 counties. over I million people. It provides over 500 known Multi-
pic Sclerosis patients with medical care. counseling. and social activities.
40%; of all monies collected go to'ntttionul research of Multiple :S_clerosis .

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

 

'by Maureen D. Grelse ' v
Many faculty, students. and members of the
Archeological Institute of Albany joined together Mon-
day night to hear Vassos Karageorghis speak on, “The
Royal Neeropolis of Salmis in Cyprus and the Homertc
World." . . _ , '
Dr. Karageorghis is the Director of Antiquttres. tn
Nicosia. Cyprus. He supervises. and as a ranktng
member of the Cypriot government. gives permtssston
for all-archeologicai work done on the island. In the Fall
of I973. he was given the honorary appointment afﬁd-
junct Professor of Classical Archeology at SUNYA. ‘
in the hour long presentation. Karageorghis showed
over 75 slides of excavations from Salamis during the
Homeric period. roughly the 8th century B.C. Speaking
with a Cypriot ‘accent. he focused on the small town of
Salamis. a window which opened Cyprus to the east. The
town. which was buried in sand. after being excavated.
revealed a gymnasium. a theatre and many tombs.
The focus of Karagheorghis' lecture was to illustrate
that many items Homer described iii the Iliad
and the Odyssey did not come from the Myccnean

period (the Trojan War). 1200 B.C.. but came from

Homer‘s own period. 800 I3.C. In other words. what
Homer did not know about the Trojan War, 400 years
earlier. ltc filled in with information from his own time.
Karageorghis showed slide after slide of items discovered
in Salamis from the Homeric period which Homer had
described as coming from the Mycenean period. He
emphasized that these were not Homeric inventions but
actual ﬁndings.

Among these items were vases. sculptures and swords.
Others included the“ skeletons of two horses. one that
was sacriﬁced and another whose head got twisted trying
to free the first and also died.

photographed and. then reconstructed. The wheel con:
tained ten spokes and each had a 54 centimeter lynchpin
of iron. The upper partof the lynchpin was it sculptured
ﬁgure of .a soldier. Other lynchpins were carved into the
head of a sphinx. The chariot box was constructed out of
plated osier wood. Karageorghis said that the chariot
was reconstructed to see if it was functional. “It really
worked." said Karageorghis. It was on display in
Nicosia, Cyprus. But because the museum is only a [cw
feet from the line dividing the Greeks and the links. [his
and other precious findings were moved to safely in
Limasel.

Four breastplates made of bronze were also dis.
covered in the town, each decorated with mnlti-fignrw
monstrous demons from Egyptian mythology.

During this period. it Was customary to bury precious
gifts with the dead. Among the gifts found in n lottlhtl'as
a bronze cauldron was ttot meant to be used and had no

were small ﬁgurines separated by a few inches each
which were plated with ivory. Chemical \\ct'c used to
keep the cauldronintact but when the chunncttn nun-
removed. it fell into many pieces. In the spirit ol inter-
national cooperation. the pieces were then senl in Ger-
man arcltcologists who put thccttuldron back together.“
was then returned to Cyprus.

After Karageorghis had finished. many people canni-
to the front to shake handsand congratulate hint on his
work. In conjunction with his visit. an exhibition. “the
