f theauthority and respect it has consistently relinquished to the Executive Branch‘xof
Student» Association over the past three years. Some‘ coiincilmen, in a move that sur-

prised many of. their fellowmembers and angered many others. challenged the Ex-_

ecutiite‘Braiich Organization Proposal offered by President Pat Curran. which passed
[Council last week: CIirran's organizational scheme would have provided for the es-
, tablishment'of an Executive-run group whichhe termed ’PROBE. Passed before the

. council elections were held, and before‘tli‘é new members tooktheir seats, the plan was V

supported by a narro'ui'one-vote margin of 7-6.

For the discussion over the highly. controversial PROBE, Council had originally.

'voted to go into Executive Session. a process by which all spectators and non-Council
members are required to leave” to let Council debate the issue in secret. It was during
this secret session that the organization plan containingPROBE was passed. Council
members. apparently frightened over the potential power that PROBE gave to the
President, offered a bill that challenged the Executive Branch Organization plan. The

bill sought to delete PROBE speciﬁcally from the plan, and make PROBE-like‘

‘ organizations illegal. .

Council did not accept the anti-PROBE bill, defeating it by a vote of 3-5-7. The seven '

abstentions aroused the ire of some Councilmembers who on both sides of the issue,
realized-the import of their decision. Here is where Council indicated their subser-
vience to the Executive branch. They thus abdicated any possibility they might have
had to exert a powerful voice in student government.

The original conception of PROBE as it was planned by Curran allegedly was one of
an organization. run out of the President‘s office and responsible solely to the Presi-
dent. formed to investigate organization, primarily the Administration..Unfortunate-
ly, the possibility of some future investigation into student groups was notleategorical-
ly ruled out. Information gathered coule be used by SA in dealings with these groups.
“Information is power." is "the credo behind which the concept of PROBE originated.
'but in light of the “Plumbers.” information obtained through covert action, or for the
purpose of coercion and acquiescence to student demands is not power, but suicide.
Curran had allegedly planned PROBE to investigate the inner workings of the Ad-
ministration. How far “in” they go would be dependent upon the capabilities of the in-
vestigators. ' .

The potential dangers of a PROBE are obvious. First, any semblance of respect the
Administration holds for students would be erased as soon as they learn that students
are secretly investigating them. Second, the power of the Presidency could be greatly
expanded until it is out of Council's grasp. It might be very dangerous fora PROBE to
be launched into student organizations. investigating student groups and even the
Council members themselves. Although a check on groups is fundamental to any
democracy. the potential totalitarian effect of this agency is possible. These checksare
provided in the tri-partite organization.

We are sure that Curran never had any of these potentially power-aggrandizing ideas
in his mind when he conceived of PROBE. but theinstitution of PROBE would live on
through precedent, until another Lampert (SA President |two years ago) comes to
wreak chaos on the internal workings of student government.

The‘liability of PROBE is of some question as well. Though Curran is ultimately
responsible for all actions taken by the executive branch of Student Association, a
PROBE effectively operating without direct control would be free to delve into the
lives and actions of anyone both within and without the student body. The thought of
spending even one cent of student resources to enable an organization to investigate
students is unconscionable.

Council voted to table consideration of Bill 74-75 #55 until next week when a com-
mittee of its members could meet to agree on the exact wording of the PROBE bill.
Council must be wary of the dangers in a PROBE-like organization as they consider its
authorization.

With the intent of theorganization as it exists now, PROBE is far too dangerous and
far too susceptible to abuse to be allowed to exist. The concept of PROBE can be better
executed through thepresently existing S.A. internal structure. Supplementing the
President with PROBE will not accomplish the goals which Curran seeks. Council has
its one last chance to assert itself.

Not A Lincoln But An Edse

   

WASHINGTON—President Ford went
out of his way to invite young people tc pa'r-
ticipate in his recent seriesof summit meeting:
on the economy. but from his initial
recommendations to Congress last week.
you‘d never know it. .

There wasn‘t a single provision in his
economic game plan desigri’ed' to benefit
young workers out in search oftheir firstjob.
In fact. the President made it clear that his new
programs were intended only to assist those

persons already in the work force, and that the .

requirements for eligibility exclude persons
who have not worked before.

To get ajob in his proposed new Communi-
ty Improvement Corps. for example, one
would have to have exhausted all his un-
employment insurance benefits—something

i‘Wthh the first-time job seeker obviously
couldn‘t do since he would not qualify for
those benefits in the first place.

This means that of all middle and lower in-
come wage citrncrs~those who will bear the
brunt of Mr. Ford‘s inﬂation ﬁghting
program-persons about to enter the work
force for the first time will be hit hardest.

.When National Student Lobby executive
director Arthur T. Rodbell made this point to
budget director Roy L. Ash in aclosed White
House meeting last Wednesday. the best Ash

. and his aides could come up with was. “There
are already u lot of programs to aid students."
He might have added. as Rodbeil did. that
most of them are funded at about 50 per cent
of their authorization.

But even so, that isn't the point. It isn‘t
students who are going to find themselves
against it slope wull under the President‘s
program «it is thoscwho huvejust crossed the
barrier into the work world and are trying for
the ﬁrst time to earn their own way. "

In today’s job market. crossing that barrier
successfully is already difﬁcult enough. With
unemploymtent approaching six per. cent
employers are, able 1 to hire experience '
workers for the same dollars that in better.
times couldghave been commandcdlby recent'

jects to improve. beautify and cnhttncu the en-
vironment of our cities. towns. illlil min»
trysidc." through his planned Community llll-

‘ provcment Corps.

To add insult to injury. the President
further proposed to saddle iinninrried tinge
corners with an additional live per cent hill-
charge tiix. beginning at the $7.5tiii-zi-ictii
level. a sum which Mr. Ford termed the tit-gin-

My mind. through my eyes. has been taken on a tout
from birth to death. through sickness and cure. with the
help of Dan Budnik and'l'he Albany Medical Center.

The tour we are taken on follows two basic paths. the
patients and the staff. Our tour of the doctor‘s lives Is
neat and clear. a barrage ofphotos ofstudents at Albany
Med. and several pictures of doctors both practicing
their trade and reacting to it. A

All of Bud nik‘s pictures are technically correct. but it
was in the photos of the patients that I found myself
drawn through the veneer of technical evaluation and
into emotional invo'IVement. ‘

In this way we are taken on a tour through life. Star-
ting as a premature baby. displayed to emphasize the
frailty to which life is heir. The ages of man continue‘un-
til the Viewer finds himself face to face with a pigtailed
beauty of. perhaps ten years. She is sitting on a bed With

her current reading matter in front of her, a copy of
Spookytown comics. As our eyes drift back into the pic—
ture. something not quite recognizable is seen (but this
is a series of shots about a hospital. so that must be)..an
oxygen tent. Our young lady is taking a short vacation
from her enclosed breathing space. . I

Through the ages of man. we are taken to several pic-
turcs which more than bring us down to earth. They are
shots of burn victims both young and old. Shots as part
it person‘s life that he will never see. his own plastic sur-
gery. Finally. toa rebirth: a man. ﬂexing his muscles, and
feeling strength in them for perhaps the first time in
weeks. as a whirlpool bath putslife back into his bones.

In this way our minds are taken through the cold
business of sickness and cure. and into the warmth of a
child in any setting. All of this set in a general chronicle

of a medical center. with its students. doctors. and .

mm

patients. .
Budnik displays his ability to preserve a series ofevents
on film in the other section of this exhibit (upstairs).
There. are displayed Budnik‘s pictures of his friend. a
sculptor. David Smith. This exhibit chronicles the work
of Smith. as he createdhnd revises his works. Smith
works in metal: painted, varnished. buffed. stainless. and
rusted. in his home. Smith is working and living. and we
see this through the eyes of Dan Budnik. . ‘
If you like Smith's work. the upstairs exhibit Will be in-
teresting to you. It is only a portrayal of Smith..l.l‘ptllall'8
we see sparingly little of the strength and creattvtty that
we see in the Albany Med study.
