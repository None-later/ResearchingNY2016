Some classical scholars. as one might expect. became university
presidents: Theodore D. Woolsey (l80l-l889) at Yale University. Cornelius

l903) at the University of California.

University. US. Secretary of State. and U.S. Senator. In I860 he was the can-

One of Everett's students at Harvard University was George Bancroft

left to become co-founder of the Round Hill School at Northampton. Mass.
He eventually abandoned teaching to devote himself to politics and writing
on American history. He served as US. minister in London and later in
Berlin. As Secretary of the Navy in l845 he established the United States

a monumental work still famous although somewhat outdated.

Lovers and Other Trials

by Joel Gross

Two Experimental Tlmtre shows
will be hokling auditions tltis
weekend. Trial by Jury, a musical
comedy by Gilbert and Sullivan. will

be having its auditions on Fri.. Oct. ‘

IS in the Studio Theatre. Loverst
Other Strangers. a comedy by Renee

Taylor and Joseph Bologna. will'

hold its auditions in the Studio
Theatre on Sun. and Mon. Oct. 20
and 2].

Trial by Jury is a light opera. It
was the first Gilbert and Sullivan
success. and its style set the pattern
for their later better-known works.
It's only one act in length. and the
plot is simple: Edwin. tired of being
in love with Angelina. has fallen in
l0ve with someone else. so she sues
him for a breach of promise of
marriage. The trial is the subject
matter of the play. which by use of
satire makes a mockery of the prac.
tice of Justice. Besides the two
romantic lads. the characters in-
clude the Counsel for Angelina. the
Usher (bailiff). a chorus of Jurists

and Bridesmaids and the highly es-
teemed Learned Judge. Production
dates are Fri. and Sat.. Nov. 15 and
16 in the Studio Theatre.

Lovers and Others Strangers is a
series of playlets which demonstrate
in wildly funny ways how lovers
often are truly strangers. Two of the
four playlets will be performed:

‘fBrenda and Jerry" and “Johnny
and Wilma”. In the first. Jerry wants
to get Brenda into bed but Brenda
wants a “meaningful relationship".
In the next one Wilma wants more
love from hcrhusbnnd. which rcsults
in an argument over who “can the
pantsin the family. Production dates
are Nov. 8 and 9. in the Arena
Theatre.

Class of 77
Meeting

Sunday, Oct 20

 

 

Chuck Wayne and Joe Putt-
wrapped up their ertasgcment at the
Persian Room with a small but
cheering group of: jazz fans. who
have probably never heard guitar
playing like that in their lives. Of
course, Albanians lead sheltered
lives, but this duo has stood even the
sophisticated jazz fans of New York
City on their heads. Their type of
quiet intensity is a rarity nowadays.

The whole evening at Shaker‘s
Steakhouse and Jazz Emporium was
kind of weird. First there was no
piano player to work with Sal
Nistico and Nick Brignola. But the
weight was too much for Larry
Jackson and Mike Wicks. and lucki-
ly Chick Esposito, a tenor player by
trade, sat in at the piano. Later Sal
Maida sat in at the keyboard, and
helped out even more.

Somehow the competitive at-
mosphere wasn't always prevalent.
Nistico seemed a little moody. and
only when he really pushed himself
did the powerful tenor player
generate the kind of excitement of
which he is so capable. Brigrtoltt
played some nasty alto. chewing off
dozens of choruses of each tune.
seeming to taunt and challenge his
fellow homman. He also played his
electronically hooked up baritone.
but it sounded too much like an
elephant who overdosed on Alka
Seltzer. to have added any musicali-
ty to his performance.

Mike Wicks took very few bass
solos. for which I am eternally
grateful, and Larry Jackson was a
spark plug behind his drum set.
despite the fact that Nistico was in no
mood to be sparked.

This weekend, guitarist bou Volpe
will bring a trio into Shaker't in
Troy. Lou has played frequently at

tthal‘eWha'atNewYorkCitymas

recently temrdcd with Don York.
and leaoontodo mrecordlngfor
Atlantic Records. He is one of those

guitarists with tlying'ﬁngers. buthe. v

also has an attraction for melody, is
his recent appurance earlier in the
year with Don York proved.

With Volpe will be Harvie Swartz
on bass. He is quickly becoming a
favorite in the Albany area.'H'e has
that big. hearty sound. and he can
play more notes in two bars than Os-
car Peterson. He has previoust
worked with the Thad Jones - Mel
Lewis Big Band. Lee Konitz. and is
currently with Barry Miler. He can
be heard on Jackie Cain and Roy
Kral‘s recentnlbum on CT] Records.

Larry Jackson will play drums.
and he has been the unsung hero. in
this area. on more sessions than I
dare think of . He is big and strong.
and resembles Charles Mingus at his
fattest. and one could hardly believe
that he could actually get around his
drums well enough to swing. But
once again. looks can be deceiving.
and they certainly arcin this case. Hi:
can play Jomfortubly at any tempo.
and can make anyone sound more
exciting than they arc.

Gcnc Bertoncini will be finishing
his two week gig at the Persian
Room on Broadway in Mcnands this
weekend. Don‘t let his gentle ap-.
proach fool you. His guitar lines are
bursting with hidden meaning. and
his understatement oftctt is more
affective than the loudest guitar
screeching of many of his contem-
porarics.

Next week at the Persian Room
will be the legendary bebop pianist.
Al Haig. Al has played and recorded

 historic importance in th. Cha

Al has been around for many
years. but has never receivcdthe
recognition he is due. MichaclJamcs
has written in Jazz & Blues that
"therc'have been few jazz men in
whose work one findr'so discreet a
balance. such Iucidity. such subtle
expressive power." Critic Max
Harrison wrote that» Haig “nearly
always bypasses the commonplace
resolutely. but without apparent ef-
fort." .lohn Wilson of the New York
Times wrote that Haig is "a strong.
two-handed pianist with a rolling at-
tack that is sometimes punctuated by
runs that have an almost brassy
quality.” Leonard Maltin of the
Village Voice proclaimed that “He's
just a damn good jazz pianist, that‘s
all.“

Huig has recently performed at
such New York City clubs as the
Village Vanguard. Brudlcys and
Gullivers. ,
