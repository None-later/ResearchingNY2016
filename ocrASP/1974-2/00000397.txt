OCTOBER 18, 1974

by Jack Uppal

The middle game in chess usually
features deep combinations] play.
Combinations are a series of moves
whieli accomplish a goal that the
player has set. Some combinations
are directed at cheekmate, some at
winning material. and some merely
at gaining a positional advantage. Of
all the various elements of com-
binational play, the “easiest” is the
attack v against the King. The
“casiness” of this attack is comprised
of one fundamental principle: The
attack against the King must he
defended immediately. A player
must of course defend the King
(players that sacriﬁce their King do
not win games). The important thing
is that an immediate (and sometimes
forced) defense is required. This
decreases the number of possible
moves a player must consider in a
combination where he may be plan-
ning many moves ahead. Two ex-
amples of attacks against the King:

25. R-Rlich! 8-81
26. Bchh Out
27. Rchh! K-K2
28. R-B7ch resigns

Notes: a) The CO rrcct move here is I’-
K4. in this opening,white usually at-
tacks on the Kingsidc and black on
the Quecnside. it is necessary for
black to drive away the knight on
whites 04.

h) This knight belongs on Q83.

c) not l7. ...l’x|’; lii.npr.
d)White should attack before black
removes his king to safety.

cl This was forced. On 20. ...K—K2:
2|.li-N5ch wins the Queen. Or 20.
...K-Ql: 2LQ-RS wins the knight
since 2|. ...Q-QZ 22.NxK|'ch NxN:
23.lixN wins the Queen.

I) Avoids the threat of El. ...l’-K4'.
22.N moves Norm-It winning the
Queen. Illaek is in a bind.

giA good try but this also does not
work. Not 21. ...K-Ql'.’: 22.0-R5L‘h
followed by P-N4 wins the N.

it) Seems to win a piece. but really
doesn't. lite rest is forced.
