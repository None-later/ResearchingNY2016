wgre’ 7 two highlights
at the University Wind
Ensemble Concert. Two trumpeters

played Vivaldi‘s: Concerto for Two‘

Trumpets and pianist Findlay
Cockrell played 'Cteorge Gershwin's
I Rhapsody in Blue. The two
trumpeters had a line tone and a
brilliantttttacl't. all making their per-
xfortnahce very impressive. Cockrell
played-pure Gershwin. What other
. pianists tend to do is overuse the sus-
tain pedal causing the music to run
together. ' Not Cockrell. Clarity and
feeling marked his performance
tonigltt. - '

There were a multitude of -non
musical excuses for the way the Un-
iversity Wind Ensemble performed.
As conductor Charles Boito put it.
the group is pressed for time and.
owing to a limited number of music

majors in the ensemble, the quality-

to be expected can only be so good.
Mr. Boito complains of departmen-
tal problems such as being short
staffed and so forth. In reality it boils
down to a question of leadership.
There are the same problems in all of
‘ the major music organizations here.
but their performances are often
very good and sometimes even great.
The UWE is a rather select group.
however. and can thus be assumed to
contain ‘many good individual
players. The problems arise when
they all play together. This underlies
the I crying urgency for good
leadership. In fact. it is not only the
conductor that must accommodate
to the large numbers of players. but
it is the responsibility of each
member of the ensemble to make
certain adjustments in his or herown
attitudes. It is not good enough that
each player play his or her own part
wcll. Each one must be aware of
what the person next to him isdoing.
“what the whole section is doing and
what the ensemble as a whole is do—
ing. In the Chaconnc movement of
the First Suite in El) the opening
theme is repeated throughout. At no
time during the piece did it seem that
any one section was aware of how
any of the other scctionswerc inter-
preting that melody. Ensemble
means together. but implies together
as one. There must be a unity of
thought as well as playing. There
should he as much listening as there
is playing, on the part of each in-

dividual. It is only when one listens
carefully thatlhe can begin to solve
musicafproblems.

Now for the wind part. Sinceall of
the instruments. excepting the per-
.cussion are wind instruments.
special attention mustbe paid to
breathing. It would be most helpful
ifthc first ten minutes of each rehear-
sal were invested in playing long
sustained notes as an' exercise in
breathing and listening to tone and
intonation. Each player and the con-
ductor as well will notice a
remarkable improvement afterjust a
few rehearsals of this.

The audience. for the most part.
enjoyed the concert. The UWE was
at its best duringthe Gershwin piece;
the musicians seemed to he inspired
both by the music and the soloist.
What this shows is that the
enthusiasm is there somewhere and
what is needed is a good set of cir-
cumstances to bring it out.

Sights,

by Paul Pelagllli

One of the ﬁrst breaths I took this
morning irritated my raw. parched
throat. As I coughed I knew this
wasn't going to be one of my better
days. Lately I‘ve been ﬁlled with
mixed. ambiguous feelings. Today
the thoughts that have ﬁlled me with
consternation took overand stayed.

'l‘hroughout the day l was very in-
troverted since I was constantly
looking at the aspects of my person
which i do not readily display. As
people filed past me on the lunch line
I had difficulty recognizing faces. I
wished to be silent towards the peo-
ple for whom [normally have a'good
word. I could not formulate any
thoughts while I worked. so I
couldn‘t pinpoint just what was
making me feel so worthless.

The day progressed this way until
dinner. At home with my apartment-
mates I almost relaxed. However.
the stimulating inanitics. with which
I usually grace meals. \vcrcahscnt. I
had a good evening planned htit my
state of mind left mcapprchcnsivc. I
was \‘cry full alter dinner and never
should have eaten those brownies.

 

We have to get the SUNYA bus
and hope we catch the start of 200i:
A Space Odyssey.

We missed five minutes of it but I
don‘t really care because lcan‘t keep
my eyes open. Thanks for nudging
mc Alan. I almost was out there.
This is supposed to be a good ﬁlm so
I should stay awake.

I remember the monolith and the
apes from the first time I saw this but
that‘s all that I recall. The monolith
means knowledge. something I
haven‘t been attaining as of late.

Another monolith on the moon.

I have to go through the some shit
that I put up with each day as I go to
what end‘.’ What am Igoing to do
with the lack ofpractieal knowledge
that plagues mc'.’ If you‘re truly ex-
cellent at some task or in some field
you have it made. since the monetary
rewards in this world go to those
who are superior. Mediocrity has
always been the degree to which my
abilities rise. The fact that I try to be
a decent human being and make life
more tolerable for those around me

is not sufficient for success. I truly
want to succeed at something.

Two ultra intelligent and compe-
tent human beings arc on the Jupiter
ship along with a computer whose
series has been perfect in operation.
Soaring through space while self-
degmding thoughts are forced into
my mind. I should have learned
about computers. An English major
with ca pabilitics at the mean will not
go far. Law school. maybe. But the
field is so competitive and you‘re so
average.

Who cares. I feel useless and I
don‘t care if anyone else does.

Do I have to stn rt again after this
is all over'.’ What am I complaining
about? The time I spend tutoringat a
prison has shown me my situation
isn‘t so bad. Yet there is a thin line
between them and me. since few of
them are real criminals. Dope busts
or petty larceny arc the reasons for
them being where they are. l’crhaps
their social or economic status has
caused them to be failures and out-
casts. Ilut society only sanctions
success. and l have no excuse.

the ambiguity of my confident
nature (confident when fed with
Iavornblc criticism). at odds with my
awareness of my shortcomings and
limited abilities. has rested on a
balance till tonight. I‘ve been
overwhelmed by myself. The reason
I‘ve been so affected is 'thc
predominance in my mind of me.
