Manhattan. I’m plagued by unusually ob~
noxious people bent on causing my evening's
ruination. I_ suspect it‘s a sort of franchise
operation.

Now. it‘s not like lgo looking for these sort
of people. I keep pretty much to myself. and
x -‘ rarely talk to strangers. But they seek me out.

Z ‘ I'll be waiting at the bar for Joe (all
‘ bartenders are named Joe) to mix up some
drinks. and a guy will come up to me. sit
himself down next to where I‘m waiting. and
introduce himself. Fine. I exchange the cor-
. diality. and stareoff into space. not wanting to
further the conversation. But I should be so
lucky.

Sometimes i don't have to wait that long.

the karate guy will be challenged by an un-

knowledgcby throwing someone. And this. of

More than unique aesthetic values are involved. Through the work of students. private
' studies have been prepared which show that the Pine

urce. 2) it is of unique historic and archaeological Value. 3) it is a rare inland pine barren (an
mogical rarity) and 4),it is useful as a natural buffer space. (The value of this region will be ex-

a future ASP article.)

ti From the Frog's Mouth is not anti-development! it is common sense to accept the premise that

there are places to build and there are places not to build.
The Pine Bush. what's left of it. should be set aside as a natural park. not a park to be littered

with paper wrappers and swing

sets. but rather an coo-park. an area which provides the hiker
