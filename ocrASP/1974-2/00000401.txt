by George Miller I
Coming oft“ one of their biggest

, wins of Ihc season this past weekend

at Colgate, the Albany State cross-
country team kept up their winning
pace. as they crushed Hartwick
College Tuesday afternoon.

Eleventh Victory

The Danc‘s cicvonth victory was
easily assured by placing five men
ahead of Hurtwick‘s first. For
Hurtwick it‘s been 11 disappointing
year. its the loss sci their record back
to 2-6.

It was at strong showing for the
Albany runners. despite the luck of
competition. and it also allowed
Couch Munscy to bring up some .IV
barriers for the meet. Tying for first

time ever on the Hartwick course.

With a 27:19.

     
  
  
      

“They ran just great}? said Coach
Munscy afterwards. ‘fl‘m just tickled
with the times." .' j'

The times-were good'and so was
the price. At the two milc mark it‘was
Vun th. Du'vis and Bums'lcuding
the way. with an impressive time of
9:56. For those of you who have
trouble with numbers. that‘s under
five minutes per mich

Batmen’s Statistics Reflect Season

by Mike Plclterdti

Well. we fed the stats into the com-
puter and the result was “too little
data.“ In tmth, the ﬁnal statistics
show only is 6-10 season for the
Albany varsity baseball team and
not is whole lot of promising
numbers in the hitting and pitching
departments. either.

It was not it great season for the
Danes. But looking at it from the
personnel standpoint. they did better
than many expected. Lack of ex-
pcricncc was the main cause for thc
“so-so“ campaign and Coach
IIurIingumc commented, more than
once. on the fact that then: were “u

The lack of any .300 hitter in

“Potentially we have three or four

expected more in the way of average
