Among the incapacitated are Ty
Curran. Orin Griffin. and Bob
Shucchenko. All three are keys to
the Dttne success this season. Cottch
Ford is hopingthat Curran and Grif-
fin can play tomorrow. although it is
doubtful that Shuccheoko will play.
He entered the infirmary last Week
with a concussion. and was later
found to have mononucleosis. liis
chances of returning to action this
season are questionable.

“Mass. Ma ritime is basically attir-
ty football team. and We were hung
ed around physically. although the
score was tto indication." remarked
Couch l‘ortf nbottt the medical
reports after the trittmph.

Nichols College is a solid team
that stresses the basic fundamentals
of football. Conch Ford calls the
Nichols squad very cuthusittsic and
one that makes very few mistakes.
“Nichols executes its plays very well.
They will not beat themselves by
mental or physical errors."

on-l break and probable goal. The
resulting direct kick was taken by
Raul Ortega. and Sykes. alone in
front-of the Dane net. sent it home
for what turned out to be an in.
suranee goal. ' .

The game opened with the type of
end to end. even play that most
soccer and hockey fans prefer. Both
teatns failed to capitalize on several
scoring opportunities for the ﬁrst
twenty minutes of play, including a
breakaway which was broken up by '
Dane fullback Leroy Aldrich.

With 20 minutes left in the first
half. just when a ﬂurry of shots at the
Dane net appeared to have been
weathered successfully. Goglia came
from the outside to send a 30-yard
shot at the Dane net. Albany goalie
Henry Obwald was completely
screened on the play. and ‘nevcr
even saw the shot". only “hearing the
sickening swish of the bull making
contact with the not inside the goal."

Danes Rebound

The'Danes came right back with
one of their owa. on Sclca‘s penalty
kick. which was set up after Bob

the penalty area. Selca neatly tucked
the bull in the left corner. pasta bud-

This time it was Quaraishi. picking

Dragon's end of the field for the first

the Leseburg brothers til the two
rttntring hack spots.

The tnorule of the Albany State
team is high for this game. Coach
Ford is weary of injuries trod cites
this its the ettrretrt problem. "Over
the last two years we‘ve been able to

haven‘t had serious injuries: they‘ve ~
just been crippling in the respect that

For the Danes there were several
bright spots in the loss. and some
serious disappointments. On the
positive side was Leroy Aldrich,
playing like the Ali-New York State
player he was last year. For the ﬁrst
time in ﬁvegames.Aldrieh played his
position, center fullback. and not the
whole ﬁeld. Carlos Rovito turned in
another ﬁne performace at center
halfback. and Bob Sohlegel played
well at the left fullback spot.

On the negative side, were injuries
to Emerick Browne-Markc and
Jerry Lee Hing. Hing. already suffer-
ing from a near-separated shoulder.
fell. re-injuring the shoulder.

Browne-Marke waskickcd in the
leg. and suffered a bad bmise. Also
of importance was the failure. once
again. of the Booters‘ forwards to
take advantage of the scoring oppor-
tunities which were presented them.
and too much dribbling by in-
dividuals. instead of quick passing
(known as one-timing).

“We played our best game of this
season." said Ouconta Coach Garth
Strant. “We remembered how close
we came to losing to you last year
(Onconta pulled that one out with
two late goals. 2-l ). and had no in-
tentions of lettittg it happen here. i
moved Qunraishi up to center halt'to
add some scorirtg pttnch. and he and
Sykes were successful in dominating

much of the second half play.“

“What can i say.“ said u disap-
pointed Bootcr Coach Bill
Schieffelin. "We are still experien-
cing tltc problems which lurve
plagued us all season——missed scor—
ing opportunities and overdribbling
by individuals.“

The Hooters have backed
themselves up against a wall. and
must now win every game they ltave
left (including‘ undefeated Union.
ttnd highly rated Binghamton) to
guarantee an NCAA bid. their.
next game is this Saturday.at l l pm.

SA President Pat Curran an- ‘
bounced this past weekend that he
would ask Central Council to delete
Project PROBE. the controversial
Executive investigative arm. from
the SA Executive organization plan.
Cottncil is expected to comply.

Though the existence of PROBE
was upheld in last Wednesday‘s
Council meeting. Curran wants to
delete it because of “over-reaction"
and “misundcrstandings“. and since
"at this point there is no way to
repair the image of PROBE".

I'lRG-like

Crtrran plans to set up an open
organization jointly with Central
Council that would workon the
kinds of projects he originally tutti in
mind for PROBE. These included
PlRG-like price comparisons of and
research on the bookstore and other
on—campus institutions such as the
Sttrdent lletrltlt Service.

One SA official noted that Curran
rnigltt place those projects under
another executive arm sttch as the
Ombudsman. '

Opponents of PROBE lutdn‘t ob.
jected to those kinds of" irr-
vcstigutions: they were concerned
with rumors of l'ltOlili in-
vestigations inttr students and ad-
ministrators. the Executive Branch
said that PROBE t'lltlltl be used. if
thC‘S‘Stlr)’. to clteck up on ad—
trtinistrtttors and students.

Curran pointed out that SA
groups cart always be investigated as
a matter of regular policy. “Audits.”
he said. “can still be performed by
the Comptroller."

Curran explained that in the era of
Watergate. all executives have to be
careful.

No ortc accused Curran of platt-
tting to misuse PROBE; opponents
such as Finance Committee
Chairperson Ken Wax and Council
member Andy (iotdstcin (State)
spoke of PROBE‘s answerability. its
control and the possibilities ot‘ubasc
by future SA Governments.

Secret Meeting

A group of opponents including
Wax. Goldsteiu. Speakers‘ Forum
Chairperson Rich Edelman and
Council member Russ Johnson
(Commuters) tnet secretly on Fri-
day. October llth. to discuss their
apprehensions about PROBE.

PROBE had passed Council the
Wednesday before as part of the Ex-
ecutive Branch Organiration.

At the October ninth Council
meeting they went into Executive
Session to discuss the President‘s
Executive Branch Organization. The
contents of Executive Session are
secret. but people leaving itnd then
retttrrting to the meeting after the
session said the six negative votes
(the plan passed) cottltl only be ex-
plained by a long discussion of
PROBE dttring the session.-

Hestricl The President

the group considered it Con-
stitutional Amendment that wottld
restrict the investigrltive powers of
the SA President into the personal
livl " of students. professors anti ud-
mirristrators. In a series of meetings
they spoke to various members _of
Council and other student lenders.
and decided instead to work up sup-
port fora deletion bill. -

Russ Johnson and Andy Golds-
tein introduced such a bill. “Deletion
of Project PROBE". into Cotrncil
last Wednesday. PROBE‘s existence
was upheld by Council. 3-5-7. Mtrrty
of the opponents expressed surprise
over the number of abstentions.

 

Places In Hell

Sandy liodner. Vice—Chairperson
of Speakers“ Forum said. with
apologies to Dante: “The hottest
places in hell are reserved for those
people who itt titnc of great moral
crisis retain their neutrality."

The group was still concerned rrnd
spoke to Curran artd SA Veep lra
Bi‘rnbaum on Friday morning. the
fifth. ‘

Curran was pleased to note that
the opponents of PROBE made sure
he knew that there was nothing per—
sonal in tlreiractions; there were no
hard feelings.

The Image

Curran said he came to his deci-
sion after evaluating the extent of
misunderstandings about PROBE.
the feelings expressed by the op-
ponents in meetings with him. the
A SI’ coverage and editorial. and the
intage ot‘ PROBE that was resulting
front all this. Since he felt that
I’ROBli‘s irnrrge would lessen its
effectiveness rtrtd cause dissention in

Faculty 'l'o Decide On Powers,-
Academt'c, Student, And Others 

by David (Inyne

l'oduy til 3:30 in the CC.

Ballroom tlterc will be a meeting of

the votirtg faculty to decide policy on
University governance. Proposed
nmendrnents to be voted ttpon in-
cltrde one that would transfer the
University Senate‘s academic
powers to an all-Faculty Council
and one that would in effect mttke
student representation in the Senate
nolonger dependent on yearly Facul-
ty votes. .
Not Forces At War

The cigltt proposed amendments
to the Faculty fly-laws were in-
lroduced for the first time at the
faculty meeting of August 28. first
meeting lacked the 40% quorum
necessary to vote on the issues
presented. If the meetitrg today fails
to draw a quorum. the proposals will
probably be voted on by mail ballot
and the issues will never receive the
public debate that they deserve.
Faculty on all sides ol‘the issucshttve
urged their colleagues to attend ttud
help reach a decision.

“! trust the faculty and the Senate can

troversial and substantive tlratt the
first. they reflect two very distinct
theories of university governance.
War (iames
One camp (and there is no intert-
tiou of making this souttd like forces
at war for there is much roorn for
compromise) believes irt all universi-
ty governance. a system in which
those affected by tr policy have some
voice in the decision making. These
people are in support of proposals
rturuhcr two. three. and five.
The second camp believes that the
faculty should be the governing body
. on rtll academic issues (and irt some
cases on all issues). Unfortunately.
an increase iii the power oftlte facul-
ty necessitates a comparable
decrease in the power of the other
constituent groups that makeup the
University. it is not that these people
have rntrlintentions. There are
members of every constituent body
that would like to increase the power
' of their respective group.
Black And White
'l'ltet‘e are very few people whose
philosophies rtrc qtrite as black arid
wltite as those reported above. Most
a re positioned somewhere between
the two camps. What follows is a
summary of tire proposals and some
of the opittiort on each side of cttch
one.
('otrneil Creation

Proposal ntrmber seven is the
most controversial of the
amendments. It calls for thccreation
of a Faculty Academic Council in
which the “powers of the Senate irt
academic matters shall be vested.“

 

 

 

 

this council would consist of “the
' President of the University. the
'Aeadcmic Vice President of the Ull—
iversity. the chairman ol'tlte Senate.
and all other Senators duly elected

‘ or nppoitrtcd who are members of

the academic stal‘l'of the University.“
The Vice President for Academic
Affairs would determine what does
or does not constitute an academic
matter.

Proponents of this amettdtueut
argue that academic policy should be
determined by the academic stuff.
they argue that the University
Senate is no longer the Faculty
Senate it once was. They say that the
Senate now deals priruurily with
such issuesas "pets. pistolsnnd park-
ing.“

Depends ()n Deﬁnition

Opponents to amendment 7 poirtt
out that the bills dealt with by the
senate over the past three years are
between 35 and 7bi academic
depending on the strictness of your
definition. More importantly. they
argue. academic policy affects more
than just the academic staff of the
university. that N'I‘Ps and students
are as integral to the determination
of academic policy as anyone. It is
further argued that no mic person
should decide what is and is not
academic.

Need For Distinction .

Professor Arthur Collins has in-
troduced rt substitute to proposal
number 7. It calls f'orthe equivalent
of a caucus of the faculty Senators.
Collins and the other supporters of
