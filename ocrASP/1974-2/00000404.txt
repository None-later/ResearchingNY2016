Itlcal Separation

Opponents to ‘the‘proposrtl claim
that-there is, no need ‘ for political
separaiittm on campus and that
legitlmiz ing such a thing by puttingit

iillhlllgi by-lrtws is counterproductive.

Olhcrs say that no one would ever at-
tain! a meeting of the Collins council
because it has no power.

'l‘hceffeet ofp‘roposal numbcrtwo
is. to reserve the l2 atalnrge faculty
Senators for the non-teaching
professionals (NTl’s). The ctrrrent
Senate has approximately I2 N'l'l’s
on it so the issue here is more one of
metltod than substance.

Proponents of the proposal say
that each constituency of the Senate
should be elected separately by and
from the constituency. Opponents
argue that Nl'l’s should not be
diflerentiated from teaching faculty
since they are included under the
delinition of voting faculty.

According to the Ad Hoc Com-
mittee on By-laws. “a vote in favor of
the resolution (proposal number 3)
would make student membership on
the Senate continuous until
modiﬁed by positive Faculty action.
A \ote iii favor would be a vote in
favor of a Senate broadly represen-
tative til the University community."

“A vote against this resolution
would be a into in favor of the idea
that the Senate shotrld become a
body representative primarily of the
academic and prol'cssiqpnl staff.“

has been renewed by the faculty rin-
anally since students first served in
I9ti9-l97tl.

Amendment number four will

_ only be introduced it'nutnbcrthree is

defeated. its total ell‘ect would be to
remove the three student seats from
the Executive Committee of the
Senate. I hose who oppose proposal
number 3 and support this proposal
argue that the students can not in-
tegrate their sell-interest with the
lotig-tcriii good ol the Unitersity.
'l’hose on the other side of these two
proposals say that students have

has when he \otcs on a change in

c\en the most conscientious student

conllict is no greater than that which
a faculty Senator has when the
totes on tenure criteria. In either
case. the solution is not necessarily
to eliminate the constituency ‘s \oicc.

resolution would be it vote in favor

community.“

Remove Staff Member?

Proposal number six would only
he introduced in the event of number
live being defeated. “The net effect
of this amendment will be to remove
from the Executive Committee the
one staff member provided by the
existing By—laws." Those who op-
pose six arid favor lite say that those
who are members of the service staff
should have a voice in Senate
matters too. Those on the other side
of this issue lecl that service stal'fare
unetl'ccted by most of what the
Senate decides and so they shottld
not participate in the decision mak-
ing process.

IOIOIOICIOI. I

by Hal Kenneth rm:

_ The Student Associatiori'elcctions were held farthesecOnd smith Titer-
day. Wednesday. and Thursday. This second and ﬁnal election was brought

about by problems that came up in the first election.

This time. the running of the elections was more centralized. due to the

placing of the responsibility for them in the hands of Linda Weinstock. As
Electrons Commissioner,'shc organized a committee of three people..in-
eluding Andy Dolan, Roberta Kupiec. and John Levenson. The committee
then tried to make sure that no problems would arise this time. and thntthe
elections would run smoothly. ' " ' ‘

As a result. only one minor problem arose. in the Campus Center. the
name of one candidate was left off the University Senate ballot for the com-

muter voters. Since these were paper ballots because no voting machine was

used. a list wuskept of everyone who voted. The error was not realized until
twenty people had voted.
