appeared to be an impregnable hold

One major reason for‘the Democrat's
strong showing is Malcolm Wilson.
Lieutenant Governor for 15iyears,
Wilson took over the state reins when
Rockefeller finally decided last year
that he could fulfill his White House
dreamifiom his launching pad of New

York governor. Although he has been _

- It ,was not until Carey’s surprising _

victory oVer Howard Samuels in the
Democratic primaries in September
that Wilson acknowledged his bleak
situation. He immediately went on the
'offensive, attacking his opponent for
his advocation of public strikes and his
responsibility for the nation's"double-
digit inflation, a direct result of huge
federal deficits in which Hugh Carey
participated."

But, Wilson’s liabilities are not all'
personal. 1974 looks likea bad year for
the Republican party. Watergate and
the economic situation, two issues
voters have clearly identified with
Republicah politics, look as if they'll
take their toll in the elections. Hugh
Carey has not failed to take advantage

‘ of present voter disenchantment.

Speaking at a dinner for the Liberal
party, Carey proclaimed, "Let the word
go forth to every politiCianrwho shows
up at the office to”pick up his check—
the free ride is over."

In his remarks delivered at the
meeting of the Associated Press
Ma naging Editors, Carey cited what he
called examples of financial waste and
mismanagement during the “spen-
ding spree" that served "the political
fortunes of the Republican establish-
ment rather than the people.” Carey
blasted the Republican administration
under Rockefeller and Wilson for
spending “two years and $250,000 to
prove there was no possibility of an
earthquake in northern New York." He
charged the Republicans also spent
nearly $500 million of 74 commissions

that serve as "career launching pads"
for party faithfuls. Carey accused the
party of spending $3 million on civil
defense and fallout shelters "a year
after those projects were abolished by
the state."

While Time magazine (October 21
issue) described Carey as "no high
powered thinker or spender," it is
precisely this characteristic that is
behind the Carey reputation.

Carey is not espousing the
traditional Democratic Liberal line. He
is taking moderate stands on en-
vironmental issues and busing. He is
assuming a cautious position against
taxes, promising to block President
Ford's surtax proposal from his
(Carey’s) post on the House Ways and

Means Committee. Carey has voiced '

support of the tax in principle, provid-
ed that the minimum income for
families is $25,000 rather than $15,—
000. in state taxes, Carey has said the
middle income family has been taxed
enough. Any new tax legislationshould
hit the upper income brackets.

While Wilson has accused Carey's
running mate of "being soft on crime,"

he cannotsay the same about his op.
ponent. In the October 14 debate
between the two gubernatorial con-
tenders, Carey attacked the governor
in his opening remarks. “I ask you what
crime fights you have really engaged
in and initiated. We had 300,000
burglaries in the metropolitan area,
3800 apprehensions and 327 convic-
tions...l am sure the Governor is not
proud of that record....As a matter
fact...under the 16 years in which you
have been with Governor Rockefeller,
crime has risen in this state by 379 per
cent." Carey has been an outspoken
Congressperson on crime, calling for
more neighborhood police in New
York City. In the past, he has appealed
to former Mayors for an increase in the
number of police patrols.

Like Wilson's liabilities, Carey's
assets are not entirely his own. His ri in
ning mate, Mary Anne Krupsak, [ill
and Polish, is one of the most eXL‘tliiirj

figures to appear in New York politics.
She is energetic, knows the issues
thoroughly, and is sensitive to the
political views of her supporters. it
appears that being a woman is not (1
disadvantage in the 1974 politics.

Even without Krupsak's help,
Carey's record alone is one that has
earned him considerable respect from
many politicians and voters both
Republican and Democrat. Carey
helped rebuild the Brooklyn Navy
yard after the government decided in
1969 to close it down. Six thousand
people now have to Il's there. In his OWii
district, Carey help'ed a group of P90
ple turn some of the most decayed
abandoned houses in New York into
tiveable homes.

Carey was a leading supporterof the
revenue-sharing law ‘that has brought
over one-billion dollars into New York.

Carey's progressive activities in
areas of labor have earned him the en-
dorsement of the powerful state AFL-
ClO. He also received the nod from the
Civil Servant’s Employee Association
(CSEA).

His campaign has successfully
drawn together many diverseelementii
of the Democratic Party, an achieve-
ment that has been rare in recent
years. For this reason it is not surprising
that there has been serious talk of
Hugh Carey's future in national
politics. However, for Carey, it is one

OCTOBER 22, 1974

.Described alternately as dull,
prolessorial, methodical, thoughtful,
unimaginative, politically sharp, and
politically dangerous, Governor
Malcolm Wilson will try, in a race as
only the state machine can prod him, to
capture the State House on his own
merits on election. ACan 55
vociferous obstacle to that goal is
DI:IIIOCl‘Ltl Hugh Carey. The battle that
the two have waged during this cam—
paign is akin to the wolf tearing apart
the sheep. Wilson's chances for keep-
ing his job are poor.

Wilson brings with him to the elec-
tion a record in state governmental al-
tairs that Congressman Carey ob—
Viously cannot hope to match, basical‘
ly because Carey has been legislating
in Washington. Wilson's major point of
attack is ironically his major weakness
as well. He has served as lieutenant
governor for 16 years under Nelson
Rockefellerand, until his boss' resigna-
tion, probably fewer than half of the
politically-aware electorate could
elicit the name of Malcolm Wilson. As
the State Republ‘can Party Chairman
Richard Rosenbaum admits, Wilson is
a "low-key" politician. Most of his
detractors will add that he is a “low-
key” man as well.

The Governor may be forced into the
spotlig ht in spite of himself, as Queens
Itoro ugh Presidents Donald Manes has
filed a civil suit against the Governor
charging him with accepting a half
million dollars in legal fees while he
was serving as lieutenant governor.
Documents presented to Federal Disv
trict Court reveal that these allegations
probably are true. The Governor said
that he has had no conflict of interest
since assuming the governorship. He
resigned his partnershipin his law firm
three days before taking the office of
Governor. Wilson further denied all
allegations in the suit.

in a recent New York Times debate
held With his opponent, Wilson
challenged Carey in a free—for-all
where accusations, misstatements and
policy issues all fought for the same
sentence. The Governor, responding
to an allegation by Carey of the state's
habit of paying lull»tirrie salaries to
prirttiine commission members, said,
"There is no public employee in the
state, other than the Legislature, where
a full time person is doing anything
other than full-time work.”

Carey: "How about the Southeast
Water Commission?" '

Wilson:  . .The members of the com-
mission are not compensated. Seine
corrimissioners are compensated."

' Wilson's bid for election cannot be
helped by the‘disclosure of his former
boss' huge contributions to . key

"political figures. Wilson said on the

Port Authority, "We cannot have men
and women who are paupers running
these Authorities, because that's not
the real world." The question was rais-
ed in regards to whether he would
change the composition of the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey,

Wilson didn't campaign too hard in the beginning.
Now he’s feeling the pressure.

Carey;  . . The Southeast Water
commission will make important
judgments on what we do with the
water table in Nassau and Suffolk
Counties.

"1 therefore don't know what this
cornmission is doing up in Syracuse
when the competence to make that
judgment is out in Stony Brook and
we can get it for nothing.”

Wilson: "Hugh, you have gone tothe
State University campus and told the
students what they want to hear——
namely that you are going to roll back
the tuitions.”

Carey: "No, i said, I would stabilize
tuitions, Governor, because I said that
the present tuition policy of the State
University is unfair to veterans, for in-
stance."

Wilson: "Let‘s talk about you ad-
vocating strikes against the people. . 

Wilson had said before the debate
that “when you get into a debate for—
mat. . . it is impossible for any contes-
tant to give a complete answer so as to
inform the people.“

Apparently, his rapid decline in the
polls immediately after the Democratic
primary prompted him to accept this
debate with Carey. Wilson has, in fact,
been gaining in the most recent polls,
picking up four percentage points on
his opponent in two weeks. His lowest
point was 29 points behind Carey.

The Wilson-Case ticket is depending
heavily on the image of the two men as,
as Wilson put it, "experienced, calm,
competent men." His campaign which
until fairly recently has been as bland

and retain William Ronan, who receiv«
~ed over one-half million dollars in gifts
from former Governor Rockefeller, as
the Authority's chairman.

On one of the few issues upon which
the Governor has taken a stand, that of

public campaign financing is perhaps.

the most perplexing. He has stated un-
equivocably, "I'm against public finan-
cing, which means that instead of go-
ing to feed the poor, that money will go
to the politicians." The coffers of the
state Republican Party are perhaps at
their richest point in recent history.
Wilson's stand on key issues is
characteristcally cloudy. He had
originally stated that he would not rule
out the possibility of a doubling of the
SUNY tuition in the coming year, but
has completely retracted that state-
ment. before a conference of the Stu-
dent Association of the State Universi-

ty, Wilson said that he has ."absolutely~»
no plans to raise tuition." He back-
tracked from that definitive pasition by
qualifying that his decision rests solely
"as long est am in ‘a position to in-
fluence the decision."

The Governor has stated more than i

once that he is opposed to the
President‘s conditional amnesty plan,
favoring instead trials fordesertion and
draft evasion before granting even,
preliminary consideration of amnesty. ~

Hisother major firm position is on the
state's bargaining power with public
employees. He is emphaticallyagainst
any revision in the Taylor Law, which
prohibits strikes by public workers,
and tu rther would veto any legislation
which contained a provision allowing
pensions as a bargaining issue in state
Contract talks. He would oppose raise
ing the pensions of civil employees.
saying the matter isn'teven one for dis-
cussion.

While he has no plans for new taxes,
Wilson has said that the possiblity has
not been ruled out for the middle in‘
come bracket, unlike Carey's stand of
taxmg only the upper income bracket
ll needed.

Wilson has been basing his cam—
paign against Carey partly on what he
considers is the Democrats respon-
sibility lor the loss of jobs in New York,
as well agztlie precarious positionvol
state tinanbing of mass transit. He said
that he is tired of talk and new
demands "the money, the money, the
money. l've put the taxpayers money
where my mouth is. l have put the local
taxpayers money where my mouth is,
and you and ourfriendsin Washington
(addressing Carey) who control the
Congress haven't put out taxpayers'
money where your mouths are. And M
stands for money and M stands for
mouth. We had enough mouth. 1 now
want the money and lwanted it a long
time ago."

Perhaps most revealing aspect of-
candidate Wilson is the literature he
has been diseminating to the public.
The great bulk of the inlorrnation deals
exclusively with what has been ac-
complished during his years under
Rockefeller, and the legislation passed
during his own administration, the ma-
jority of which were initiated under
Rockefeller's aegis. The literature is
surprisingly lacking in any policy
statements for the future . . . We know
what Rockefeller has done to us, and
Wilson is hoping that his association
with the Rockefeller "successes" wrtl
pull him through at the polls.
