Teriy Kenny Il' chasing an.

American dream. 1 He wants to be a

major league baseball player. Most .

young boys growing up in the United
States have that same dream. but
never get a chance to play
professionally. Kenny is different.
By playing minor league baseball
this past summer. Kenny has started
his slow climb to the top.

Unlike many of his teammates.
who are chasing that same dream.
'Kenny's baseball background is uni-

que. He reﬁned his baseball skills. ‘

while playing ball for two years at
Albany State. thus making him the
first athlete from this school to ever
sign a professional sports contract-

Terry was picked in the ninth rou-
nd ofthe baseballdraft lastJune. by
the San Francisco Giants, after
breaking Albany‘s l4 year batting
record. hitting .453.

For the months of July and
August. Kenny playedtheoutfield at
Montana in the Pioneer League.
Hampercd byarm and ankle injuries
for much of his two month stay.
Terry batted in low .2005. “The
pitching was outstanding."admittcd
Kenny. “They had good controland
threw a wide variety of pitches.“
Kenny. though. has shown the abili-
ty to hit the curve ball. a problem
that has ruined many promising
prospect‘s career.

Kenny is at a disadvantage
because he comes from the East. He
is trying to compete against players
from the West. who. because of the
warm weather. have played three
times as many games than Kenny in
preparation for pro. ball. These
players got to see a great deal more
pitching and were given a better
chance to develop theirtalcnts.Also.
Kenny. who is 23 years old. is com-
peting against many players just out
of high school.

Minorleaguclivingisnotthe most
comfortable life. but Kenny has
learned to enjoy it in hopes of realiz-
ing his goal. Terry. like all first year
ballplaycrs. earned five-hundred
dollars a month. The travelling was
especially tough. as Kenny had to
suffer through a couple of nineand a
half hour bus trips. When the team
was on thcroad. Terry received only
five dollars a day for meal money, to
spend in greasy diners all over the

Nortthst. The motels the team
stayed in were barely livable. Terry
and hisi teammates. though really
competitorsycre able to establish a
good relationships on these road
trips.

Kenny is a resident of Albany.
having gone toCardinal McCloskey
High School and then onto Hudson
Valley Community College. In hit
senior year at Hudson Valley. Terry
was the team's MVP and he batteda
respectable .330. But there were no
four year schools knocking on Ken-
ny's door with scholarships. He
chose to go to Albany State because
of the school‘s fine Business School

bv student association

Mitch 7-5187

funded

and because Albany lit his'economic I

situation.'

At Albany. Terry got that all im-
portant playing time and learned
baseball strategy from ‘ Coach
Burlingamc. He and Jack Lcaby
starred on the Danes 72-73
SUNYAC championship team and
Kenny was the MVP on last year's
squad. The Angels. l’hillies and the
Giants all expressed interest in Ken-
ny and the Giants decided they
wanted him the most. '

His chance for a sewnd year of
baseball is favorable. Because of
Terry’s fine throwing arm. the Giant
braintrusts are considering
switching him to pitching. if his hit-

:e‘Top

ting doesn't come along. Terry had
pref/loust pitched in high school
and one game for Albany. “Anyway
I make it is okay," stressed Kenny.
“The coaches knowwhat‘s best."

Kenny realizes the chances of his
making the majors aren‘t that great.
“1 will give myselftwo or three years
to see how I progress toward Triple
A ball or the majors....l was married
last May. so I don‘t want to waste
time." Currently. Terry is com-
pleting his requirements for a
marketing degree here. and he will
have that to fall back on.

'l'crry Kenny is a lucky man. He‘s
got aohancc to make hisdrcam come
true. Time will tell.

Ithaca Wins, Hobart Upset

(AI’) Ithaca College's football
team has taken another giant step
down the road to an undefeated
season. but Coach Jim Butterﬁeld is
trying hard to ignore it.

“I‘m not even thinkingthat way."
Butterfield insisted Sunday after the
Bombers posted a 24-l4 come-from-
behind victory over Wilkes College
in Pennsylvania. “There’s only one
thing I‘m thinking about and that‘s
beating Bridgeport. Conn. next
Saturday.

Hobart Upset'

Previously undefeated Hobart
was upset by Alfred 16-0 as Coach
Alex Yunevich‘s Saxon line held
Hobart's Little All-American. Rich
Kowalski. to 27 yards on 17 carries.
Kowalski went into the game averag-
ing |25 yards per contest.

In other games. Bob Russell
scored three touchdowns. all on
short runs. to pace Brockport.
Albany‘s next opponent. to a 33-l0
triumph over RIT. Steve Sutton
caught two touchdown passes from
John Farrar to spark St. Lawrence
to a 30-20 victory over Plattsburgh
State. and host Amherst Mass. shut
out the University of Rochester 27-0.

Ithaca. the top-rated small college
football team in the East. picked up
its sixth straight victory this season
by scoring three second-hall
touchdowns. The Bombers trailed
14-7 at the half and Coach Butter-
f'lcld admits he was concerned.

“At halftime we reviewed our
game plan.“ he said. “We felt that we
were a better half club than Wilkes
and we felt that we could beat them if
we just went to work.“

The Bombers tied the game in the
third period. driving 6| yards with
Bill Carey breaking loose for an
eight-yard scoring sprint. then surg-
ed ahead for the victory on Mike
Markowick’s 29-yard field goal.

Underdog Alfred stopped
Hobart’s running game with just 33
net yards. The host Saxons. who had
lost three straight. took a 3-0 lead on
a 26-yard field goal by Charles
Stanley in the first quarter. Alfred
made it 10-0 at the half after iuuior
defensive end Joe Van Cura
recovered Hobart quarterback .icll
'I'hon‘s fumble in the and tone. Rich
Hansingcr scored the other
touchdown by racing 32 yards in the
third period.

. “We moved the ball quickly. with
a minimum of dribbling by in-
dividuals. " said Schicffelin.“andfor
the ﬁrst time in several games. We
used the whole field. instead of

allowing play'to collapse in to the
middle."

Team Play~

Typical of the teamwork and

the. Danes' fourth goal. Fullback
Ricardo Rose stopped a Potsdam

Potsdam territory. and thep led-fed

Walton

by Kenneth Ardulno

The National Basketball Associa-
tion Western Division should
provide a great deal of excitement
this year with the addition of Bill
Walton and a host ofnew faces. Here
is tltc rundown.

Midwest

The Milrt'aukee Bucks have lost
Robinson. but they still should be

. tough. as long as Jabbar is around.

Despite physical problems. Jabbar
should be ready before too long. If

not. forget it.

Bob Dandridge and Steve
Kubcrski are the forwards. but depth
will be a problem. The guardsare set
with Allen. McGlothin. George
Thompson and Gary Brokaw. One
of them must quarterback.

The Chicago Bulls now have a
bona Iidc center in Nate Thurmond
and they should immediately becon-
tenders again.

Gone is Bob Weiss. who will be
missed. but Norm Van Lier. Jerry
Sloan. Matt Guokas and Pat Riley
are a foursome to be reckoned with.
If they can learn to play together.
they should be real contenders.

Adds Excitement ,,

The surprise team last year was
Detroit. They stood relatively pat
and it may show. Bob Lanier is the
big man and the key. Curtis Rowe

seem to get the job done. Dave Bing
runs the backcourt. which is lackin
after the loss of Lantz. The Pistons
did not improve themselves and it
should show in the toughercompeti-
tion this year.

Kansas City-Omaha has Nate but
that‘s about it. Jimmy Walker will
get his twenty-five and Nate will get
thirty. Sam Lacey is the center and
the forwards are weak. No depth is
another problem for the last place
Kings.

Pacific Division

Gone isJerry West. but the Lakers
may have a better team this year.
Elmore Smith is a proven center.
Connie Hawkins and Happy
Hairston will hold down the forward
spot. until Cazzie gets back from
knee surgery. Zelmo Beatty is now
the back-up center. lending depth.

Gail Goodrich and Jim Price will
handle the guard position. backed
up by rookie Brian Winters. The
Lakers will be in the thickof this

Purl/am] has the potential to be
the super team. Bill Walton will try
to turn the team around. as Jabbar
did with Milwaukee. He has much
better potential and better personnel
to work with. Sidney Wickswill help
him underneath and score his twen-
ty.

Player coach Wilkens will lend
stability along with super scorer
Geoff l’etrie. ll Walton can fulfill his
promise and the bench comes
around. it could be a big year.

Sean/e went out and got Tom
Burrelson. With tutor Bill Russell.
that raw talent could be flamest
into a superstar. Spencer Haywood
is one of the five best forwards in the
league. Archie Clark becomes the
playmaker. and Fred Brown and
Slick Wattsdo a good job in the back
court.

Kennedy McIntosh or John
Hummer will fill out the lineup. The
Sonics need a good start and some
luck in this real tough division.

Golden State has lost Lee. Russell
and Thurrnond. Whether they have
the replacements. only time will tell.
Cliff Ray is the center but he won‘t
score much. Rick Barry and rookie
Keith Wilkes will play forward. but
who will rebound?

Jeff Mullins and Dutch Beard are
at guard but-there is absolutely no
depth. Golden State doesn't seem to
have enough to compete.

Phoenix is destined to the cellar
once again. Charlie Scott and Dick
Van Arsdale will play offense while
Dennis Awtry and Curtis Perry play
defense. John Schumate. troubled
by blood clots. will be lost for the
whole season. Phoenixwill have to
