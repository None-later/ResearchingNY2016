as even- miracle melt Rudy Vido and
Tommy" Deaiots came out of the
game with more then their share of
aches and pains. I

The game had the makings of a
really fine competitive contest;
something the Great Danes haven't
seen since the Alfred game. Nichols.
like Albany. was undefeated and the
Bisons had defeated Albany in their
only previous meeting. Vido
described the game perfectly. ter-
ming it a “Natural Psych." '

Albany was ready. as once again
the defense led the way. The front
fourwere outstanding. as they com-
pletely shut off Nichols‘ ground at-
tack. allowing the Bisons only l3
yards. The pass defense was ade-
quate. giving Nichols the short yar-
dage.

The defense compensated for the
offense. which had trouble getting
started. It took the offense most of
the first half to get used to Nichols‘
multiple defense. The team was
hampered by over one-hundred
yards in penalties. which nullified
some long gainers. Bertuui‘s pass-
ing was off. as he failed to complete it
pass in six attempts.

Similar to Last Yorr'

The game started similar to last
year‘s Nichols-Albany game. as the
Danes fumbred the ball three times
in the early going and the team
wasn‘t able to get good ﬁeld posi-
tion.

Albany was able to scor'c the se-
cond time they had the ball. though.
They ate up good chunks of yar-
dage on the ground. as they drove to

Offense Show: Little

Beside that play. the offenseeould
not'muster much untilmidway in the.
second half. as, things seem ‘to
change. when Albany had the wind.
Al Martin’s ﬁeld goal attempt'from
31 yards wasjust wide. as it hit the
goal post. N ichols took over on their .
twenty. but could only move
backwards. forcing them to punt.

The punter kicked a short line
drive punt to the Nichols‘ 3ft yard
line. where Skip Scurry grabbed the
football and took off. He went
straight up the middle and was un-
touched as he flew into theend zone.
'l‘his-was Albany's first punt return
ever for a touchdown and the score
proved to bea key play in the game.
It put Nichols down by two
touchdown‘s at half time.

In the second half. the Albany
Great Dane ground machine really
started rolling. as DeBlois. Orin
Griffin and Glenn Sowalskie all had
large gains and blocked well when
they weren‘t carrying the ball.

The Danes were able to capitalize
on Nichols‘ mistakes. in the opening
minutes of the half. Albany
recovered a fumble on the Bison 32
yard line. Five plays later Sowalskic
went wide from the two for the score.

Midway in the third quarter. Don
Mion intercepted a Nichols‘ passand
carried to the 42. The Danes
drove down to the goal line. led by
three good runs by Sowalskle. From
the ten. Griffin took a pitch and out
ran his defender to the end zone.

Nichols then started on their only
successful drive of the game. as they
moved from their own twenty and I
marched to the end zone. Nichols‘
quarterback. Don Leonard ex- .

thought that Will juat got the top of ,
the helmet. .
This' brought the ball to the ﬁve
and two plays later. Bill Lefabre
, 'went over for the score. The two-
point conversion madethe seare 25-
8 and gave Nichols new hope. Their
seventeen play drive. though. was a
costly one. as: it used up a good
chunk of the clock (5:49).

,Albiiny Comes Back

Any thoughts of Nichols being
able to come back in the fourth
quarter were quickly dispelled. as
Albany came right back. driving
seventy yards‘and eating up' the
clock. The march was completed
when super fullback Tommy
DeBlois went over from the two. to
close out the scoring for the day.

For the Danes. it was a complete

team effort. similar to the Hofstra
game. Couch Ford felt that Nichols
was an extremely well coached team
and the itisons showed it in their
play. ,
The Danes. who were number one
in the country in yards rushing last
week. grinded up 374 yardsagainst
Nichols. Statistically. Tommy
Delllois was the star. as he chalked
up Is} yards on the ground. l00
coming in the first half. DeBlois
gives much credit for his success to
his front line. who he labels as “The
best in the East.“

Albany. now 5.0 has until Satur-
day to rest up for Brockport State.
The Danes have never beaten the
Golden Eagles. The players just
can't wait to geta hold of Brockport
this year.

Plattsburgb Edges Albany

by George Miller

Sometimes you play well. but
sometimes well isn‘t good enough.
This was the case for the Albany
State cross-country team. this past
Saturday. as they relinquished their
SUNYAC title to a hardnosed
Plattsburgh group 41-48.

Since the first meet of the season.
the barriers have been running each
race better than the previous oneand
it was just a matter of time before
that one race appeared; where they
just couldn‘t put out that little extra
to win.

"As a team. they ran great.“ said
Coach Munscy of Plattsburgh. "We
just ran good."

Flttt Course

The meet was run over an excep-

tionally ﬂat course at Broekport.

~ something that the Albany runners
aren't used to at all. The result,
I however. was very fast timeii. despite
a 30° temperature. snow flurriesand

a biting wind. For the 5 mile jaunt
Vinny Reds placed fourth for State
with a 25:02. Backing him up were
Chris Burns. 7th: Carlo Cherubino.

8th and Brian Davis. l3th.

Teague Wins

unfortunately... things turned out
one better for l’lattsburgh. as they
appeared to have one man ahead of
every Albany runner. Winning the
meet was Bruce Teaguc with a light-
ning fast 24:49. Following him in
was Brian Dodge. 3rd: John Evans
6th and their fourth man thh.

Illustrating the really fast times is
the fact that Roda was holding sixth
placeat the mile mark with a4z4l. By
the two mile post Vinny had moved
up a notch to 5th and was clocked at
a 9:44.

Fast Race

“ltwas u very fast race. " remarked
Munsey. “I‘m sure it's the fastest
SUNY Conference meet ever held."

' Regarding specific performances.
however. Munsey felt. “Reds and
Cherrie both didn't have their extra
sharpness. They rati very good but“

. M... ......,_..WWW.......M-W-

Concerning the remainder of the ..
team he said. “The rest of the group 
run very well.“ 9

Even though Plattsburgh and ‘-
Albany tilted the scores a bit. the
conference. which consists of ten, 3' ‘
teams. was still fairly well
represented. (ieneseo ( l03) had three L
strong runners grabbing 2nd. 9th

and llth place, but lacked the depth :1

to put forth a real challenge. Other
scores were Buffalo State (l35).

I'retty Disappointed

"We‘re pretty disappointed. " said
Munsey.“but we're not offering any
excuses. We ran into a team that wa
really keyed up for it. They ran an
extremely good race.“ .

The varsity will be lookin
forward to a chance to redee r»,
themselves this Saturday whe
SUNYA hosts the Albany l .
vitational at 12:40. Cross-count
fans can expect some good runni ‘
this weekend. as Coach Mun
simply stated. “We'll do somewh'

Coming To Sign Disputed Housing Bill

by Nancy Albaugh

Albany Mayor Erastus Corning is
expected to sign the Common Coun-
cil housing proposal that would limit
students to three periipartment. un-
less they were related.

Corning sent a letter to SA Presi-
dent l’at Curran. statingthtitthestu-
dent government‘s proposal was un—
workable. Their proposal. based on
the numberof people per square feel.
would not place any limit on the

tnumber of non-related people living

together. Corning thought the
proposal would allow too large an
increase in the downtown density of
population.

Curran is expected to contact Cor-
ning today to see if he will indeed
sign the proposed Common Council
bill.

According to the SA President.
“We havcdottcjust about allwecait.
It's up to him now."

Amendment to the Original?

SA was considering amending its
first proposal so that tltc square
footage required would be increased
in one-fartiin [ones to lower the
potential density increase Corning
feared. Curran said. however. "Ira
iiii'nhitum (SA Veep) and others dis-
cussed that this summer with the
mayor. and there were some
problems."

Last week. Corning had a study
done in the Manning Boulevard arcit
arid decided that if the SA proposal
were pttt itito effect. nearly 2,000 ex-
tra people cotild inch in.

Criticized by llirnitbum for using
the Manning Boulevard area rather
than a “student neighborhood."

Corning liiid another study done on
Statcand Hamilton streets. Hceites
that study in his letter to Curran:

4,000 More in 2 Blocks

“I looked at the two blocks that we
discussed at our last meeting anti in
each block it would have been possi-
ble to have as many as 2.000 un-
related adults. The 380 and 80
square feet just doesn‘t work ina one
or two family lone. lwould increase
the allowable density tremendous-
ly."

The specifics of the SA housing
proposal were that 380 square feel
would be required in it one-person
apartment. with 80 more square feet
for each additional person.

Birnbaum said that heagrecd with
Central Council's cit-Chairperson
David Coync. who said some weeks
ago that “Mayor Corning is playing
games with us.“ He thought that
Corning was “leading us on“ for his
own political motives,

Parking I’lan - Maybe

Corning did say that he would
cotisidcr the proposed SA parking
plan. saying he hoped “this will be in-
troduced iii the Common Council in
November." He made no commit-
ment to its support. however.

As well. the rather elusive mayor
said he had more ideas for other stu-
dent apartments. Last week he had
said l'liatclicr Homes in the south
ctid of Albany might provide some
housing.

'l his week he said. “I am going to
make a survey of housing accom-
modations such as Central Towers
and South Mall TOWcrs which I
know are not fttlty occupied. It may
be possible to have sortie units
available in either or built of these
buildings."

Corning said that in his opinion
students now living in apartments
oil-campus will ttot bctlircittciicd by
the new law when he signs it. Next
year. however. there may be
problems.

According to liirnbaum. SUNYA
President lienczet has made no
attempt to offer an alternative
proposal. He did attend a meeting
with Corning and the SA Execs.
however.

Some Student Association of-
ficials say SA is contemplating some
action before the mayor signs the

bill. Says Birnbaunt. “I know Pat
(Currant is opposed to this. but I
think it would be a good idea to
arrange a sit-in of some type bcthen
the time he tells us he will sign the bill
and when he actually signs it.“ This
action was also proposed in Central
Council Wednesday night by newly
elected member Michael Sakoff.

SA also proposed that the off-
campus housing office list all
apartments that have been granted a
“Certificate of Occupance." Cor-
iiitig thought this “could be worked
out."

small demonstration. and set it for
the next aftemoon when Curran
would be meeting with President
Benezet on the issue. After this was
all planned they found out that
Item-let couldn‘t make themeeting
that day: it was rescheduled for
Thursday at ten. But the people were
there. and they wanted to get the
answer. and they teamed that
Ilene/ct was in the office. Said
Mitlkiii: "i don‘t set: any need to have

tron.“
