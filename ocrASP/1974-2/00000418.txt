The Allen Center is not a clinic for
the‘ sick. as has been rumored. I
it is an institution for learning.
located at Draper Hail near the
downtown campus. and may be best
described as a sort of ‘Department‘
ol' Social Sciences. Technically the
Allen Center is one of the three un-
dergraduate Schools of SU NYA; its
students upon graduation receive a
t'ully accredited B.A. diploma from
the University. Draper Hall itself
contains a library. computer
’facilities. and classrooms.

'l'hc Allen Center offers but one '

major. called “Man and His lit-
stitutions." which covers in an‘ in-
terrelated fashion all of the dis-
ciplines involved in the social
sciences. The separation of subject
matter that occurs in the courses of
the uptown campus isthusavoided.

A special service of the Allen
Center is that it enables intelligent
high schoolers to pass up a
sometimes wasteful senior year and
to enter college directly.

Scholars with an interest in the
social sciences and a desire to par-
ticipate in both school affairs and'in
novel learning methods are
recruited. A B-plus average is the
grading requirement. Transfer
students. SUNYA freshmen and
upper-level students wishing to
switch to the socialscience major are

. also encouraged to enter.

The Center was set up with the

idea that those attending the place

. would become deeplytnvolved in all

voting bloc against students. The in-

terests of faculty and students usual-
ly run parallel. they say at the Allen-
Center.

All this brings up an interesting
question. Could the Allen Center.
which grants its students effective

executive power. have been set up as

a ‘sal'ety valve‘ to divert vocal and
dissident studentsand teachers away
from the main University'! After all.
the Allen Center was founded a few
years ago. when stud‘ent distur-
bances were common. Ad-
ministrators deny this theory. but in
one class we sat in on a female stu-
dent brought up the same subject.
“Here i can release all my
frustrations which I build up at that
stupid place uptown.“ she said.

Of all the Allen Center students
with whom we talked. not a one
characterited the institution as
“had.” indeed. most were
remarkably lavish in their praise.

Much_of the schoolwork consists '

in reading source materials (c.g..
John Locke for a political science
class and Plato for Philosophy )The
readings are then discussed and
debated in class. Many papers are
also assigned. seemingly more than
in uptown courses.

Often. a team of teachers lecture
together. which makes it easier for
students to see the intcrrelatedness
of subjects. Students sometimes pre-
sent relevant material to the class.

methods are widespread. ‘

rejected the appointment of Jay
Miller as the campus ombudsman.

Council failed to muster the two-.1
thirds margin needed to approve
Miller‘s appointment. The vote was
9-7 for his approval. with sixabstcn-
lions.

Miller. who was SA President Pat
Currun‘s choice l'or the job was re-
jected because of his “inexperience”
and “negative feedback" he got. said
Lew llarr. Chairperson of the Ap-
pointments Reviewing Committee.

The negative feedback revolved
around the Director of Albany State
Cinema‘s criticism of Miller‘s handl-
ing of his duties. Miller is a staff
member oil/\SC and orders lilms for
the film group.

I‘m told to do. only things I like. said
Miller.

Miller said that there is a "per-
sonality conﬂict" between the direc~
tor and himself.

“The Appointments Reviewing
Committee did a poor job.“ said
Miller. He explained that the com-
mittee did not balance out the
negative feedback he received with
the posititc responses he got from
others. Central Council is out to
shalt President l’at Curran. added
Miller. Central Council Chairper-
son Kline added that maybe Coun-
cil won't be a "rubber stamp" of the
SA President this year.
