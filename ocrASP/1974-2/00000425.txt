To the Editor: .

“You will forgive me if I tell you that my
people were Americans for thousands of years
before yourpeople were. The question is not
how you can Amc‘ricanize us but how we can
Americanize you. We have been working at
that for u long time. Sometimes we are dis-
couraged at the results. But we will keep try-
ing. And the first thing we want to teach you is
that. in the American way oflife. each man has
respect for his brother‘s vision. Because
each of us respected his brother's dream. we
enjoyed freedom here in America while your
people were busy killing and cnslaving each
other across the water. The relatives you left
behind are still trying to kill each other
because they have not learned there that
freedom is built 0:. my respect for my brother's
vision and his respect for mine. We have a
hard trail ahead of us in trying tcAmcricanirc
you and your white brothers. But we are not
"afraid of hard \trails." ——from Our Brother‘s
Keeper

Indian People have a vast respect for the‘
worth of the spoken or written word. The
Spoken word contains a life all it‘s own. an
endless life. The word is born. takes flight and
lives forever. And. when words have the value
of immortality. one is careful not to use them
recklessly or falsely.

in order for cultures to develop a mutual

understanding. there must be sensitivity with
respect as to how each perceives the universe.
in their characteristically unique way.
rCuItures can perpetuate illusions without be-
ing aware of it. and in a seemingly uninten-
tional and non-malicious manner. Yet. the
harm done isn't lessened any.

dings. _

The [1.5. is member of the United Nations
and is sworn to uphold it principles. The lJ,N.
proclaimed its Universal Declaration of
Human Rights in 1948 which provides: 1)
everyone has a right to a nationality; 2) no one
may be deprived of his nationalityor the right
to change his, nationality. This government
passed the Citizenship Act of 1924. making all
Indians citizens of the U.S.‘. violating the
above stated Declaration. once issued. For
those Indians seeking citizenship this was a
nice gesture. but for those who did not.a cruel
imposition.

Possibly you can imagine the situation of
Indian Peoples livingon thiscontincnt under a
truly democratic form of government.
Destroy that government. kill its leaders.
move the pe’ople to foreign soil. place an agent
on that soil to govern their affairs. gradually
establish a European system of law and order.
make him subject to state and federal laws.
then tell him everything is going to be all right
because. “We are a nation composed of all
types ol'peoplc under equal protectiott of the
law."

Unfavorable reaction to a situation such as
this is far from being “hotheaded” and “knit-
picking". Upon true realization of the entire
picture. one can realize that “bitterness” is a
relatively mild reaction to the outrages and
abuses committed (and stillso). against Native
People.

A man is not an ego-opportunist when he is
truly working for his people. The identity of
the individual is merged completely with the
consciousness of the group. There is no self
grin involved.

The Spirit ot‘Good Medicine seeks to bridge

The quantity of information produced in all
fields of knowledge is increasing at a tremen—
dous rule. making it difficult for one to keep
abreast of the latest developments. The in-
crease also makes it difficult to keep track of
studies and experiments already performed.
thus. irt turn. increasing I the. chances of
duplication of effort. Such duplication must
be avoided irt this day of inflation and high
costs. Time is of the essence.

The environmental area isa fine example of
this information explosion. Its inter-
disciplinary naturc. encompassing both the
natural and social sciences. provides data and
methodology vital to this new way of viewing
the earth and mankind's effect upon it.

How does a person or an organization go
about solving information problems? in a
governmental situationonesolution is to con-
solidate all ofthe units that arcconccrncd with
a curtain problem. and locate them in one cen-
tral locationsNew York State chose this solu-
tion for its environmental affairs. On July I.
I970. organizational units fromthc Depart-
rneut of Conservation and the Department of
Health were brought together to form the
Department of Environmental Conservation
tl).[£.C.).

Library services were not included in the
reorganiration and they weremissed. The peo-
ple.frorn the Conservation Department had a
small libraryol'approximately mot) hunksund
the Health Department personnel had been
served by a larger and more sophisticated
library which remained ill the Health Depart<
ment.

Various attempts were made during the past
4 years to establish some central library ser-
vices for the Department. The first push.
December l970—March l97l. was stopped by
the l97l statewide budget cutback and a
departmental emphasis on the reorganization
of its field services. In I972 a Self-learning
Center was established at [yr-1.0 head-
quarters. bnt this Center was mainly concern-
ed with training and career development
materials.

Later. with the help of the Division of Air
Resources. a librarian was interviewed. but
furtherjustification was required by Civil Ser-

vice and the Division ofthe Budget. In Spring
l‘)7.‘l the State Library agreed to ntakc a study
of l).l£.C.‘s library needs to prove tltc needed
justification. 'l’heir preliminary report came
out in May I974. Also during thistitnc contact
was made with the Massachusetts Audubon
Society Environmental Intern Program in
hope of acquiring temporary help for this pro-
jcct.

The writer was hired under the Audubon
El I' program and spent the summer following
up on the State Library study. A Task Force
was formed and with the help of the author a
report was turned iii to the Deputy Com-
missioner. it looks like l).li.C. is going to
rnnke it this time--thcrc are positions for a
Senior Librarian rind a Clerk heirtg considered
for the I975 Budget and the writer was hired on
a part-time basis to keep the ball rollingin this
direction.

While this whole sequence was occttrring.
the individual divisions and employees formed
their own collections. This has caused some
duplication of effort. and much wasted time
bysmplcyccsscarching for information. while
failing to help inter-divisional communica-
tion. A Department the sizeund importance of
l)_.l;'.C needs its employees spending time
solving environmental problems. not
searching and duplicating work alreadydonc.

Despite these problems. l).|;‘.C_ has done
an enormous amount of work and has ac-
cumulated tnuclt information arid data on the
environment. Various divisions publish
technical reports and the Division of
Educational Services supplies material for the
layman. D,E,c, welcomes requests for its
publications rind helps those who write or
come to 50 Wolf Road to locate additional in-
formation. Therc ure personnel to help those
who wish information now available under the
Freedom of Information Law. Use l).I;'.(‘_
You pay for it!

NO'I'E1lJibrary students and librarians: each
year brings more calls for our services through
the Audubon EIP. It is a fine way to spend
twelve weeks and if you are a student. it gives
Library School some reality. For more infor-
