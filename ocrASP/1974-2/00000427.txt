_ 5, Gentle Miller

 liig things are  store for cross-
oriuntry fans this weekend as the
Albany State campus will be the site
at the I974 Albany Invitational
~ Cross-Country Run.

An annual event. the Albany In-
vitational is one of the highlights of
the tall running season. as it
repeatedly draws large ﬁelds and
class competition from all over the
Northeast. *

In tomorrow‘s meet there will be a
total of 46 teams vying for top

‘ honors in three separate divisions:

' [our year varsity. junior varsity. and
junior college. I Since all teams will
not be entering a in“ team. the ﬁeld

‘ will total approximately 380
barriers.

The meet is set up in such a way so
that there is three separate racescor-
ressponding to the three divisions.
As in all cross-country meets the
team with the lowest score wins (i.e.
Iirst place man gets one point. bth
gels six points. l5th gets l5 points
etc. and medals will be awarded to
the top l5 finishers at the varsity

level arid the top ten in the other:
two.

The (inert Dancs.who fall into the
varsity classiﬁcation. will be
challenged by about I70 other
runners from 2! schools. With good,
still. competition lacing Albany this
year. they‘ll certainly have a job in
trying to improve on last year's 3rd
place linish.

possible outcome he replied. “There
are at least six or seven teams.any of
which could conceivably win this in-

I'd have to pick C.W. Post. They‘ve
won it the last two years.“

course tomorrow.

Certainly one of the best runners
in the region is Joe Rukarshagim ot‘
Siena.who in IS of his last 20 races
has set new records. In the previous
three years he's been here. Joe Itas

England Comes to 

by Neil Kenduek

The British sport of rugby has
become increasingly popular on
college campuses nationwide. This
year. a group of live enthusiastic
students from Albany have es-
tablished a rugby team and are now
applying for club status with the
school.

The team organizers ta coach or
captain has not yet becndesignatcd).
l-‘rank Martens. Elliot Sulsky. Tom
Sulrrlrotl'. Frank Morgiewizz. and
Bill Brenner are students with
limited playing experience. but un-
lirrritcd determination. They spent
most of last year creating the team
framework.

l heir plans have been successfully
put into action this Fall. Their team
ot'tlrirty players has been practicing
and scrimmuging regularly.
Although the majority of the players
have no previous game experience.
they ltavc acquired the basic skills
and have learned the ground rules in
a relatively short period of time.

Much ol the team‘s progress cart

trort ollercd by the players (it the

The competition is basic; ﬂesh on

Many Americans ﬁnd rugby quite
unappealing because of the negative
misconceptions they have about the
game. Rugby is often miseonstnred
as a savage game. that is played by a
gang of hrutes. who are dead from
the neck. up.. Quite the contrary.
Throughout the British Isles. rugby
is esteemed as a traditionally upper
class game. whose play is solely in-
tended l'or gentlemen. One cannot
simply get by with mere brawn.
Quick thinking and quick reactions
must be coordinated by every serious
player on the field.

l'onr Suhrltol‘l‘. a light framed
back for the Albany team believes
that. “The three essentials of the
gatnc are endurance. quickness. and
especially a ga rue sense. The guy who
knows what to do and where to be at
the right moﬁt'imt will never tire and
will always succeed." With
knowledge and “game sense" being
paramount. it is no mystery that the
talented Albany Knickerbockcrsarc
mostly comprised ol' local doctors
and lawyers.

Artotltcr ill-tourrded American
rrtytlt about rugby is that it is un-
sportsmanlike. and thus. an' un-
Amcrictrn type game. Wrong again.

Rugby has traditionally displayed
and encouraged sportsmanship and

* t'ello'wsliip. After each competition.

the home team islobliged Lto throw a
party for their guest team. ‘  .

This social reception gives the op-
posing players acllance to meet- one
another. and mutually savor the ex-
citement ot’ the game. over frosty
mugs of beer. “Rugby is more than a
sport. It‘s a whole social function.”
explains Albany rugby player.
Frank Martens. Rugby can singular-
ly make the distinction of being the
only sport where sore losersare near-
ly non-existent.

The members of the team seem to
be optimistic about acquiring club
status and. growing in size and pop-
ularity. lithe team becomes a club.
the school will lend them for the
purchase of uniforms and transpor-
tat ion. Spectator attandance has not
yet reached the scll-outhvel. but the
 arewcreasing with each
game. ‘Whggevcr is'in the vicinity
of the Elihu 'illi'come over out of
plain curiosity. They all get attracted
by the mass excitement." one team
member explained. Rugby is the ul—
tirurrtc in rawntlrletic competition. It
is colorful and exciting. Such dis—
tincti\c qualities al‘lnrd rugby a
magnetism unmatched by most
other sports.
