Danes Set For Brockport

by Les Zuckerrnan

Unbeaten Albany State. currently
ranked sixth in the Lambert Bowl.
will challenge Brockport State
tomorrow in a battle of defensive
football.

The game will begin at 2 p.m. with
a large Great Dane following ex-
pected at University Field.

Albany has faced Brockport twice
over the last two seasons. Ilotlt
games emphasized the strongdefen-
sive units of the respective schools.
This year‘s contest promises to
feature that same style of play.

The game two yearsago in Albany
ended in a Iii-13 deadlock. The
Danes rushed for ovcr400 yards. but
committed thirteen turnovers. This
was the ﬁrst game played by the'
Danes as a varsity football team.

Last year's game was more
frustrating for the Danes than the in-
augural contest. Brockport. playing
before a home crowd. shut off
numerous Albany scoring threats to
hold on to a l7-l4 victory. Once
again. turnovers hurt the Danes at
crucial points in the game.

Itrockpori is off to; shaky start
this season. They a" M after a 33-
th win last Saturday a. 'r it "11b:
lirgles litth a new head coach this
season. Dave llutter. He had been
the defensive much for several
seasons. Ilii-irr stresses defense to

his current squad and has been
successful in that department. He
uses a 4-4 formation. exactly the
same as the Danes.

Coach llob Ford is wary of the
fact that both Ilrockport and the
Danes use the same defensive
strategy. “Since we play the 4-4. we
should know the weaknesses. but
Brockport executes its defense so
well. that we‘ll be in for a rough
assignment. They come into this
game after a big victory. which
makes matters even tougher."

'l'he Brockport offense had been
struggling before last Saturday.
Coach liutter had been making
various shifts and personnel changes
to find a winning combination. Ap-
parently. he found the rigltt lineup
against RIT. The Eagles feature
Mike Scltlegal at quarterback. He‘s a
fine passer and signal caller. At
fullback is Mike Merritt. who was
llrockport's leading rusher last
season. llis skills are inside power
and excellent speed.

On defense. Ilrockpori is superb.
The from four rates as the ﬁttest that
the Duties will face this season iti
terms of ability. Mike Mueller at
defensive tackle and lien Oliver at
the end are the standouts. Thedefen-
itive secondary is quick and the
linebackers adequate. 0n the whole,
Brockport it a good defensive.

matchup for Albany State.

The Danes expect lirockport to
throw the balia great deal and to run
inside. Coach Ford calls them“not it
complete team like Nichols". “We
can try to keep them outside and
stop their inside strength." added the
coach.

Ford Pleased

Coach Ford is pleased with the
maturation of his defensive squad.
“We are playing great technical
football there have been few spec-
tacular plays. just consistent cort-
tainrncnt ."

'l‘hc Dane backfield of Tom
Dclilois. 558 yards in 76 carries and
six touchdowns. Orin Griffin. 373
yards in 42 carries and three
touchdowm‘. and Marvin I’crry. I62
yards in 37 carries and two
touchdowns. are expecting a
physical test against iirockport.
With the control of .lohn Iiertuui.
the wishbone attack will try to im‘
prove their already impressive
statistics.

Albany State has scored l96
points while giving up just 34. Ifthcy
can get points on the board iirtd stop
Brockport inside and in the air. the
unbeaten string will be secure. Ifthc
Danes commit numerous turnovers
then. as before. llrockport will prove
to be the unyielding opponent.

ﬂagrant fonts by both teams during
the second half. but both coaches
(Schieffelin and Plattsburgh‘s Bill
Utter) blamed the brawl on the of-
ficial‘s failure to maintain control of
the game. v

“The way to prevent this type of
brawl." said Schieffelin. “is to issue
warnings to any-players involved in
tit-for-tat fouling (I font you, you get
me back. I git after you again). It isti
rare player who will dare to continue
fouling. knowing that the next step
following a warning is autorttatic
ejection from the game.

The fans were also kept amused
during pauses in the action by the
utterances of Utter.who would. “put
his million dollarmoutb in gearafter
every call." to quote ortc fan. Typical
of Utter‘s remarks were. “We always
get the shaft wltcn we play here.“ and
“I have fifteen guys on the bench
who krtow you missed that ottc. ref."
Utter continued to scream that his
ten in was playing "cleanly". and was
being “chopped down by the Albany
butchers". something the non-

Plattsburgh rooters found rather
amusing, in view of the fact that the
statistics indicated that Plattsburgh
committed two fouls for every one

one-time passing exhibited against

Lake Placid to

Host Olympics  

I.AKEI’I.ACID.N.Y.(AI’) Ex-
citement rippled through this remote
Adirondack Mountain village
Wednesday as children. oldtimers
and businessmen focused their gate
on the dream of the l980 Wirttcr
Games.

“This will take care of Lake Placid
for the next 50 years!". said Lena
Dowie. operator of a local diner.
after learning the International
Olympic Comntittcc had selected the
village for the games Wednesday.

“We've been living on the last one
since I932.“ she said. referring to the
first time Lake Placid hosted the
Winter Games.

For Howard Nichclson. who was
skater Sonja IIenie‘s coaclt when
those games put Lake Placid on the
map. the announcement from Vien-
tta put new meaning into old
memories.

"It‘s wonderful." said the 62-year-
old Nicholson. talking about the
number of young skaters here Itop-
iitg for Olympic medals.

And while villagers partied and
gossiped in the mountains. officials
in Albany. Milmilessouth. prepared
to follow through on funding im-
proved facilities for the games.

(iov. Malcolm Wilson. who has
committed his administration to
backing the games. said he was
“delighted. enthusiastic and proud"
of the selection.

Estimates of what it will cost the
state to improve facilities in tltc
village run between $8 million and
fill million.

One state spokesman said
budgeting for the games could begin
its early as the 1975 fiscal your. next
April.

“He will do cverytltiitg to expedite
it so the state will be on time." a
spokesman for the governor said
when risked Wilson‘s timetable for
submitting his financial requests to
the legislature.

“He doesn't really have the go-
aiicad from the‘votcrs to begin mak-
ing financial plans." the spokesman
said. Wilson. a Republican. is seek-
ing election to it full term next
month.

will be pcrrttaneitt improvements so
the people of New York cart use them
afterward." ‘_

Mike Wilson. a seventh grader iii ‘
Lake Placid. will be a high school _‘
senior when the games are held and '
he‘s training to compete in the Nor—
dic ski event.

Kathy Pratt. I2. says. “I like the ‘ -

town the way it is and Idon‘t want to

see a lot ofcltungcs." But she says she “ ‘

looks forward to the games. I
“because it will be good for the town
and my family.“ “It‘s gonna be a
great place for the kids to grow up.“ ‘
one local booster said.

An cconontic boomis also part of
tire dream and many businessmen
contemplate cxpandingtheir lodges. '
hotels or motels.

“l fch it will be good for our
economy but we must be careful '
about indebtedness.“ said John Dix- .
on, vice principal for secondary
education.

And Peter Roy. 13. says someone
has already approached his frttltcr
about buying their house in order to
put up a motel.

Present estimates to improve ski-
relatcd facilities at Whitcface Moun-
tairt and Mt. Van Hocvcnbcrg run
about $9 million. according to a .
spokesman for the state En-
vironmental Conservation Depart-
rnertt which administers over state

About $7 million would be spent
at Whitcfacc to improve and create
trails. add tltrce lifts. put up and ex-
