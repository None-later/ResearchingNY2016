One block west of the Democrat
storefront on Central Avenue. a two
story office complex has been tem-
porarily converted into local cam-
paign headquarters for Jacob Javits.
Blotting the windows and con-
tributing signiﬁcantly to the com-
mercial character of the street is an
obtrusive banner-«“Jacob Javits for
Senator.“ .

mediately struck by the election

 
 
  

decor. l'he fine red carpeting is dis-
missed as unfortunate remnants of"
prior tenants. but for these walls
there is no excuse. They are wall-to-
wall carpeted with pro-fabricated

political signs that in a hundred _

different ways say that the most im-
portant thing in this world should be
sending Jacob Javits back to
Washington I).C. for another six
years.

the second tloor hall is littered
with these oak tag signs written in a
wild handwriting hardly suggesting
individual creativity. “Are they kid—
ding.“ l cautiously mumblc under

something more potent. but then it‘s
only l2:3() in the afternoon and the
Senator is expected to hold his news
conference in a half hour. "I'll have
some coffee. thank you.“

l'he men have conspicously

backroom. 'l'hesc aides. candidates

, A Fitted Smile

As the pressroom lills to capacity
an aide declares. “the Senator is
here." I turn my head and there some
25 feet behind me. Jacob Javits.both
hands extended, a fitted smile fixed
broadly across his face. is making his
way towards us. As he enters the
make-shift press room he introduces
himself to the more influential
members of the press. me not includ-
ed. and sits himself behind the table
prepared for this occasion.
.lavits is smiling away while I am

looking intensively for some sign. -

Something in the man's eyes. in his
voice. in his ntanncrisms that would
suggest concern. if not outright
maddening fear. that the election
will go to Clark. I should have
known that a survivor of I? years in
Washington is not going to let
ltimself look intimidated. That
would only give Clark‘s campaign
more.vnlidity. Besides. if his eyes.
voice. or hands did not betray his
alarm.perhapshiscommcntswould.
Fence Straddler

.lttvils. in the finest tradition of a

fence straddler suffered through this

news conference with all the eu-'
phemistic grace of a hemorrhoid'

commercial. He first pats himselfon
the back for providing the Albany
area with a federal grant for some
health program.

.lavils did not get to be Senator
without being attuned to an
audience and it was clear to Itim that
the pressaudicnce was not impressed
with this preamble. The Senator
then remarks. “Now. er. I think it
would be better from everybody‘s
point of view if ljust answered your
.questions. Really you don‘t want a
campaign speech from me."

 

Questions Hurled

It was not until the questions were
hurled and the answers hurled back
that one could truly appreciate
Javits‘ success in politics. I recall
thinking that if Richard Nixon
possessed a fraction of this man‘s
ability to answor a direct question.
Nelson Rockefeller would not be
Vice-President designce.

When Javits was asked ltow he in-
tended to use tapes of Ramsey Clark
that were made _in Hanoi and
supplied to the Javits campaign by
the Central Intelligence Agency. he
replied “ . . . having dealt with an
issue in the campaign as to Clark‘s
judgment with respect to foreign
policy. which he manifested in my
judgment as being inadequate to be
a Senator of the United States in a
paper he wrote on the Middle East in
which he suggested consideration ~-I
am trying to be as charitable as I
can. to the idea of a Palestinian state
between Israel and Jordan . . 
Javits never tnade it clear how the
Palestinians related to the CIA and
llanoi.

When the Senator was questioned
about his activities as head of the
I972 campaign to re—elect Richard
Nixon he responded that he opposed
Agnew's place on the ticket because
he thought Agnew had been
"dcvisive." “Two thirds of the
American people agreed with me
that ol‘ the two candidates Nixon was
the better. If lhad known then what

As the Senator was talking I
smiled thinking how absurd it was.
when just 48 hours before Richard
Nixon left the White Housethe
Senator of New York went on record
saying that “resignation would be
sterile.“

Jacob .lavits is a master. He has
learned the art of politics well. At 70 I
he is a skilled orator who knows how
to make vagueries sound like fact.
He looks you'straight in the eyes.
never raising his voice. never soun-
ding irritated. Like a master
rtuvigator Javits steers through the
thickest questioning. cletcrly direc-
ting his thought-out responses.

llut Jacob .Iavits isa little nervous.
He has taken rc-elcction for granted
for the past twelve yearsand liketuty
politician who suddenly faces a for-
midable opponent. he is relearning
that democracy survives on alter-
natives. According to those polls.
Ramsey Clark is just tlntt tilt alter-
native.

  
 

  
 
     

Troopers at
Jackson State

Over-reacted

(ZNS) A federal appeals court
panel in New Orleans has ruled that
Mississippi local and state police
grossly over-reacted when they fired
at students on the Jackson State
College campus four years ago-—
killing two students and wounding
seven others.

HoWever. that same three-judge
panel ruled that the surviving victims
of the shootings may not sue any of
the police who were responsible.

The Jackson State killings oc-
curred scveral days after the Kent
State shootings in May of 1970.
Testimony at a Mississippi trial es-
tablished that 43 local and state
police fired their riﬂes into a dor-
mitory ofblack studentsafter several
officers allegedly saw a sniper lurk-
ing inside.

The shooting. according to some
witnesses. went on for more than a
minute despite the fact that no shots
were returned from the dormitory.

The appeals court panel ruled that
although the police were responsible
for the killings. they are protected by

Mississippi state laws and the U.S.
Constitution from beingassesscd for
any damages that resulted.~
