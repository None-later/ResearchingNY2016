his hard to believe that this is the same faculty that fought soha rd at the U UPcon-
tracttalks to keep student participation on tenure review committees. It is hard to
believe that this is the same faculty thatargued the students: side on student effec-
tiveness on academic inpui. But this is the very same faculty that drew up proposals to
throw students off the University Senate. a proposal that was sidetracked only by some
iclever parliamentary maneuvering. This is the very same faculty that pushed for the es-
tablishment of an elitist Faculty Senate or Faculty Council. with all the powers ofthc
University Senate. while stripping the Senate of all of its authority.

The faculty is displaying a disturbing degree ofschizophrenia. a disease that is direct-
ly attributable to the U UP. The U Ul’ cannot maintain‘that it represents the views ofthe
faculty of this university. yet as an organized lobbying group. it is bent on imposingits
will on theirest oftheacademic body of'Albany. The U UP represents no one but its own
limited interests. When the enlightened faculty and student body realizes this. it will
understand that it takes the same degree of organization and coordination to present
an equally convincing case before the university community.

The UUl’ is playingtdirectly into the hands of the Administration by dividing the
laculty among themselves and dividing the faculty from the students. The Administra-
tiotr. recognizing the fact that they have a defined goal and a cohesive infrastructure
cannot help but play off the divisiveness that the U Ul’ is causing by pressing its uncon—
ciottablc proposals. '

Marriage American Style

Last night Rhoda got married. Millions of Americans. eyes ﬁxed to the screen.
watched one of television‘s recent favorites go through the matrimonial service that
has been the 'most talked about event since men landed on the moon. Even Mary Tyler
Moore showed up. i V . .

lo the casual observer the marriage might be thought to have been real. With full-
page coverage in the New York Tina's. the cover of Time and other magazines one
lorgcts the fact that Rhoda. her marriage. her husband. the celebration. the guests and
everything are fictional. ‘ '

Fictional l'. V. stars don‘t make the front pages very often. Social psychologists have
studied the obsession the masses often have with particular popular lreros. but those
lteros are almost always real people. What can be said about a society that. in the midst

of inflation. shortages and a sinking morale turns to Rhoda Morgenstcrn. We can say

nothing very good. .

the American Establishment has criticized over the past decade the “new
generation's“ tendency to "Drop-out and 'l'une-out“ and slip into fantasyworlds.‘l'o a
'certain degree. their fears were groundless. that is. to the degree that they singled out
the younger generation as the culprrt. But now that the era of plenty is ending we see
everybody. young and old. united in theirfascination for fictional Rhoda.

Is this our future? As food and oil disappear and population skyrockcts are we going

I -to mend our ways. establish new habits and ways ofthiuking .. . or are we going to turn

to our little boxes and watch Rhoda? Rhoda is not inherently an escape. but forhcrto

occupy the forefront of our minds when our only hope is to always be aware ol'the

world‘s changing basis of existence is a mistake.

To Confirm Rockefeller

The ASP recctlyrried an editorial I

which all four State Universities urged Nelson
Rockefeller to withdraw his name from con-
sideration for the Vice Presidency. The piece
cited such revelations as his gifts to his
associates and his underwriting of a book
criticizing Arthur Goldberg.

Further developments have included the
leaking of information showing that Rocky
owed over $820.0th in taxes for the last five
years on deductions that were disallowed by
the internal Revenue Service. The ASI'
editorial said. in a particularly vicious tone.
that "Rockefeller has gotten filthy-rich hands
ittttr every aspect ol government...” he cannot
get hituselfclected to the White House he‘s go-
ing to try his hardest to buy his entrance ticket
there.“ Of course. it‘s not popular to support
the rich. especially in today‘s political climate.
bill it seems that many l'actsare being examin-
ed out oi'perspcctivc. atrd some others are he-
irrg totally obscured.

ith: look a bit tnore closelyat the situation.
we find some interesting sitlclights. 'l'hc first
thing we must remember is that Rocky has
vast wealth. Money is not tlcarttr lriru. He oh-
vionsly realizes he has too much for one man
to spend. And his family has carried on a-
tradition of philanthropy rivaled by few. if
any. families in American history. So it
should come as no surprise that Nelson
Rockefeller has given thirty-three million
dollars to various charities over his career.
‘l'hirty~three million dollars! l’uurteen million
dollars were given away in the last ten years.
The cynic willargue that hedid this for income
tax purposesﬂhatrnuybe partially correct. llut
the fact rclmlill?Z that Rocky gave away his
money to good causes and helped other less-
lortunate people. We simply cannot forget
this when examining his competency for the
Vice-Presidency.

The matter of his gifts to associates should

~be re-cxumined in a clearer light. It has been
shown that many of the "gifts" were actually
forgiven loantr. It hurt further been discovered
that more of the gifts and loans were received
by friends in some type of ﬁnancial difficulty.

such as havrng huge medical L‘chtthcs or .urn-

ly problems. Overall. Rockefeller has merely
demonstrated more generosity. and he ts herng
criticized for it.

Then we come to the sticky prohlctn ol the
Goldberg book. This is indeed.trrr embarrass-
ment to Rockefeller. There is no justrlrerrtnnr
for his allowing the underwriting ol the lrtrok
by his brother. llut if we take Ruckclcllct's
testimony at face value. which we should he an
clincd to do. then it becotnesclcar that hcdtd
not know his brother was involved at the
financing of the project. It is also clear that
almost no one read the hook. llrc "punct-
hungry" millionaire could ccrtrunh Inn] .1

helping in the publishing of a L't'IlIL'trl trout

Well. one important fact returns to my tnrml

It just does not seem fair. Nelson Rockefeller
deserves to be confirmed.
