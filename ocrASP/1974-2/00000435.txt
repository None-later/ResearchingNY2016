explained that his true creatOr was *

Dennis Haight, a‘ schoolmate who is'

now .in forestry and knows nothing of
Ebbie's recent stardom. With another
friend, they formed the Big-3 Cartoon
Company, and created a whole en-
tourage of‘ characters to pass
classroom time more enjoyably. Eb-
bie's first big discoverer was an
English teacher, who conﬁscated him
and threw Ion into the hall, His High
School newspaper turned it down "as
being too weird".

With the passing of time, the 'Big 3'
dissolved, and the other two members
willed their characters to Ion to use as
he pleased. With the help of his brother
(who created the guy with the talking
hat whom you might know as Eddie)
Ebbie survived and many of his
cohorts were created.

As we talked, Ion instinctively took
out his pen and began to illustrate his
answers for me. “Ebbie first looked like

began as the stereotyped hippie, but
since' he's come to Albany he's
become more intellectual. His greatest
appeal seems to be to the left wing set
and philosophers.

By the time SUNYA students met him,
his body had changed from straight
lines to ballsof fur. Green'fur. "Actual-
ly, eeps are green." "Ebbie" Ion ex-
plained, "is an Everyman character;
sometimes he gets a bit pompous,
like me sometimes, i suppose."
Looking down I noticed familiar

"was a true innocent". He is Ebbie's
brother, and they are "like the

other, an idiot who thinks he's smart.

He was 'the adventurer' but he didn't

catch on so well, and disappeared at

SUN YA. It seems, "Albany doesn't

spark adventure too much".

Ebbie almost didn't make it on to the
SUN‘r’A scene. It was just through
dor‘mlriendswho saw it, likedit, and en-
couraged fan to bring it to the ASP. "It
wasn't all that good either.‘ It was
political at a time when political car-
toons were in. It didn't catch on but I
kept putting it in.There were six in dur-
ing my freshman year. I never
expected anyone to print me; I was
scared ashell to hand it in." By the end

it was time for the inevitable ques-

tion; "Ion, is Ebbie You?" He pondered
for a moment and replyed, "He's
somewhat like me, but I wouldn't count
on him being my alter-ego. He's my ex.
periences; only my immediate friends
know when he's me." "And what of
your other characters, are any of them
real people?" He explained, as he
probably has had too many times
before, that while some people inspire
aspects of certain characters, few
characters are really wholly fashioned
on people he knows. There are occa-
stonal exceptions. "People ask for
guest appearances, but I can only put
them in if they have characteristics
people can identify with."

As for taking stands on issues, Ion
emphatically told me: "My beliefs are
of no consequence anyway, but I ex-
press in each Character beliefs custom
tailored to his personality." It seems
now many people realize this because
many issues have put Ion into difficult
positions. Whenever a belief is ex-
pounded, people sensitive to the topic
get riled.

For example, based on an incident of
visiting the Campus Center men's
room and finding an inscription
proclaiming it for use of gay liberation
only, Ebbie‘s next cartoon found him in
righteous rage proclaiming "straight
lib" and attempting to liberate the
bathroom. The cartoon got terrible
feedback, but the inscription
mysteriously disappeared within a
week. Then began cartoons with God-

yf .
trey, a gay eep who is Ebbie's room- 7   F

mate ("no reference to my own room-

mate," he hastened to add) who was a ’zcce-Aﬂé

composite of all the gay people he
knew. He wanted it to bring out the
“human aspect of homosexuality: the
gayness is absent, except for the
reputation." Gay alliance thought this
was an insult, but "honestly, thatwasn't
the intention." He's been condemned
by the Italian alliance, women's move-
ment, and blacks on campus, among
others, and yet not all of each groupis
involved. Many like the cartoon
because they "see past the immediate
joke".

"None have been more sensitive to
what I've written than the ASP staff
itself. Slowly but surely they have been
forcrng me to become less controver-
sial. I've been swallowing my pride
and going back to the old zanies of
high school days."

Often he gets it from both sides. In
his earlier cartoons, when Ebbie was
still more political, Ion created a com»
pany of Vietcong eeps (green fur made
them great camouflage experts). It
was a human war; they bitched about
what they were doing, At times, the
enemies were the heroes.

 

Jon's brother, Robert, is an im-
aginative artist in his own riglitand
created hall 0! Ebbie's
compatriots—Eddie, Ellsworth, the
Eolltergeeps, Euphoric, Clint
Eepwood and Baby Ethelred
(below). Although his own school
Suny Maritime College, does not
print his cartoons, the ASP olten

has.

The two cartoons, directly above,
mark the beginning of a live-year
relationship between Ebbie the Eep
and the Albany student communi-
ty. The first was published in the

the second a little over a week later

on November 4.

He got a storm of protest from the
right wing who said it was unpatriotic
to depict communists as human
beings, they were “godless goons,"
and he was under fire from the left as
well, who felt they weren't dedicated
and staunch enough. "See what I'm up
against?"

He laughingly lellsofthe time he first
realized that EfiP was already a known
term on campus before he had ever
arrived, and that EEP on a jacket does
not signin a furry green personality;
Potters Club registered some anomosi-
ty before they realized Ebbie was not
related to their fraternity. Many in fact
have become his most congenial
followers. They didn't take offense
when an EEPeep was hit over the head

"How does Ebbie feel about the
women's movement?" I was led to en-
quire. it seems that Ebbie is a bit con-
fused about it.

"He echoes not only my confusion,
but the confusion of many of my sex,
Many guys are willing to go along but
don't really know what libbers want.
Aristotle is more knowledgeable—he
can see through the srncerity of one
like that. I'm rather envious of him—it's
something I can't do. And that's
because he's the inlelleclua.l of the
bunch."

The characters become what the
followers want of them.

"Most of Ebbie's followers
women, from a cross section of people I
know. He's a guy who could do no
wrong. In the real world he'd have a
hell of a time coping because the world
isn't made of appreciative ladies."

Unqie, a new character was one of
the quickest successes. A roommate
senior year inspired the character. He
was "Harpo Marx to Aristotle's
Groucho, a friedput anarchist whose
ways were outrageous—mind you this
is not my roommate—he took on a
character of his own. He appealed to
the anarchist in everyone; utterly in-
sane in a sly sort of way."

Another example of reader reaction
was to Squat the Magic Pig, whose
name came outof song by The Mothers
of Invention, and whose intentions
came out of an avant-garde play.
Squat is a talking pig who eats people's
faces; no one can see him, not even
Ion. He thought that everyone would
be disgusted with such a character
and was surprised at the wide follow-
ing he's acquired. Squat's fans always
ask about him and when he is going to
be in next.

  

who originally warn note or

but realizes "that jobs are getting *
scarce , , seesitas'a business hat might .
get him somewhere. Certainly Ebbie in

-the "realworld" would have tobe ._
modified. His appeal here is to students ‘

(and perhaps since Ion's T.A.ship last
year, to faculty), he would need to
become more universal. He'd have to
appeal. to "a = less sophisticated
audience" his father had told him, and
we had to laugh when lon repeated it,
both wondering about “sophisticat "
Albany students. He feels his techni-
que needs work, and that his lettering
is "atrocious".

Being lefty is anotherproblem, since
a cartoonist's hand has to rest on the
wet ink as the next frame is drawn.

When discussing the tntluence he
has through his 'work, he seemed
dubious. "In my radical days [wanted
to use my power to move students off
their rears. Ironically, at that time I
didn't have the power."

Now he seems less desirous of in-

fluencing and more intent upon amus-
mg.
“l was delighted to find I could
brighten up some people's life as a
clown. The price Ipaid was lobe iden-
tified in life as a clown. For every
threatening phone call and detrimen-
tal comment, I hope there were ten
who laughed. If that was the case my
reason for being on this earth is
justified."

"I only give the public what it wants.
My calling is to amuse, sometimes to
enlighten, but always to amuse."

As to Ion's favorite, at the moment it
might be Ungie, because there is so
much you can do with him.

“A little of me is in all the characters,
a little of everyone. A whole world of
humans have these traits. [put them in
everyone."

But what of the creator?

"There's more to me than meets the
eye on a 2 dimensional piece of new—
paper." Ion is not Ebbie the Eep, and
prefers when he meets new people not
to tell them who he is as they then
already know him. He seems resigned
that its human nature to make those
rash associations, but is upsetting
because very few people have really
gotten beyond that. He feels it is the

'biggest disadvantage' of what he does.
"1 don't like the way peole have made
value judgments on me due to my
characters," People have asked him if
he's gay due to Godfrey, and a dope
freak due to Aristotle. "I'm a victim of
my own characters. It hasn't done my
social life a great deal of good."

Arriongotlierpeople'scartoons, BC,
the Wizard 0/ Id, and The Spirit are
among his favorites.

Ebbie and Jon by this time are get-
ting impatient to graduate, "It's time for
us both to go on to bigger and better
things". But for those to whom eeps '
have become long time acquain-
tances, it will be strange to be without
thier familiar faces.

"One last thing:' I asked as we were
getting up to end, "what would Ebbie
say about having been interviewed?"
He stopped a moment to think, perhaps
to pub Ebbie's character in focus, and
almost unconsciously his pen began to

I smiled; "and what about Ion, what

"He'd probably say the same."

time for an answer, Ebbie isn'tl
