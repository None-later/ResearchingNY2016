"hard to argue with it fanatic.
y Newman. I have been told.
has an unﬁltered barroom voice.
with orange of about four notes. and
'ccassion one of his songs may
sound it lot like the last. I don‘t care.
i still think he‘s one of the best
songwriter-performers around. and
certainly rock's most intelligent

lyricist. '
- Sunday night a SUNYAaudiencc

I -. was treated to their ﬁrst view of vin<

rage Randy Newman: sardonic.
ile'iidpan. morbid. biting. touching.
weird. Alter listening to his albums
for two years. (and let me tell you.

5 ‘, I‘ve gone on Randy Newman hinges.
' ivlierc l hear so much Randy New-

man that I thought I would 'Sail
Away‘ myself). I believed that a live
1‘ perlormanee would be a disappoint-
tirent.
,_ Newman is a close range singer.
_ heavily orchestrated. with words of
quiet irony. rather than ilie
leadweiglit lyrics of rock. All ol
which lends itself tocithci' records or
nightclubs. httt not large college coti-
‘ certs.

Wrotig. Newman‘s style as a per-
l'oriner hletids iti perfectly with his
songs. His appearance. pure Neiv
York Jewish slrlep. epitomizes his
songwriting talents. Like his sotigs.
Newman is outrageously unim-

‘ posing at first glance.

‘ Stories about Randy Newman I

, he dropped out of U.C.l../\. because
liecouldn't find a parkingspot at the

'_ school one day. Watching him per~

 lorni. it‘s easy to believe. llis energy

 level is a total blackout.

The art of undercutting has been
perfected to a science by Randy
Newman. Nothing is sacred in his
songs. riot even liberals. One
number. “Rednecks.” has us
laughing at the ignorant. prejudiced
title character. “We don‘t know our
ass from a hole in the ground. iind
we‘re keeping the triggers down.".lliit
then he hits you right back with'this
line. “Down here we‘re too ignorant
to realize. that the north has set the
trigger lree. yes lrc‘s free to be prit in a
cage iii llarlctn in New York Cit

and he's free to be put in a cage on
the South-Side of Chicago.“

Randy Newman won‘t permit his
audience the luxury of condescen-
ding laughter. At least not without
becoming victims of his wit
themselves.

In concert. Newman sitves some of

his best lines for his own work. "This

song represents the low point in rock
and roll." he said about onenumber.
“ l his song almost reached a level of
mediocrity. except for this next

he commented in the middle

said. “It‘s like Leonard Cohen‘s‘

‘Sumnne: except on a lower moral'
plane.“ '

Deadpan humor is Newman‘s best
weapon. Hidden within that humor
though is a sensitive understanding
for people in trouble. “Yes baby. I

concert. fans called out for their
favorite Newman melodies. ‘

“You sure you want me to play

I'll just say that if you

you don‘t like Randy Newman.
you‘re wrong. And possibly crazy.
