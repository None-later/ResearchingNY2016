It would be nice if we could see
“the shufﬂe“ once more before it
ends. ‘

It would be thrilling to watch
George Foreman go down and have
the man standing above him, arms
raised. eyes ablaze. refusing to go to
it neutral corner as the rules of box-
ing demand—before it ends.

It would be ecstasy to watch the
man taunt his largcropponent.defy-
ing injury with lowered hands and
theloveliestsmile this side ofa locker
room...er. that is before it ends.

Because it willend you know. At 3
pm. our time—the ﬁnal fight of
Mohammad Ali will get underway.

It will be the final light because.
this time. he will be beaten so badly.

there will be no cries for a rematch.

no hope forucomeback afterwards.

Realistically. there should be no
time for the Ali-shuffle. no respite in
which to offer a taunt or smile. and
most ofall. no single moment where
All can loorn above George
Foreman. Even iftherc is, Foreman
will just get up and end the light in
victory moments later.

Foreman is the awesome punchcr.
and he is now ready. The reschedul-
ing of the light from September 24 to
tonight. because of the cut eye he
received in trrtinirrg live weeks ago.
has just allowed him to get in better
shape. ,

He is the world champion now.
and he will like nothing better than
to smash Ali before a world-wide
audience of 300 million people. Up
to 5000 of those may witness the
demolition locally. tonight. at the
Washington Avenue Armory in
Albany. ‘

Yet. there is a multitude of
reasons why Ali should win this
light. First of all. the Zaire govern-
ment says he should. A represen-
tative from it has risked Ali if he is
ready to win nearly every day.

The reason is simple. Ali speaks
for blacks all over the world. and in
Zaire he is a national hero. Ilis vic-
tory. the government hopes. would
bring the people together.
stimulating national pride and
growth. As with tnost natiotis.
growth stands for economics.

It is for this reason that this
festival was set up: to rid the world of
the idea that Zaire is still the
tumultuous Belgian Congo oi the
1960‘s. complete with voodoo dolls.
tribal warfare. and bloody political
coups. It is to attract the foreign in-
vestors who crin trip the country's
vast natural resourses.

Already. results have been less
than outstanding. A three-day
music festival. complete with great
black artists from around the world.
proved rather incoriiplcte of artists
and more so oi audience. The local
stiles of the fight. meant to fill tip a
05.000 scat. refurbished soccer
stadium. stood about 62.000 short of
that two weeks ago.

. It will be of further embarrass-
ment if Ali loses. and the Zairenns
start questioning their President
Sese Scko Mobutu as to why he led a
world-wide black leader to their
land. to be annihilated.

Anotlter reason why Ali should
win is pointed out by Jose Torres.
once world light-heavyweight cham-
pion. and now crusader for l’uerto
Rican liberties in America. He sees
Ali asa representative of struggling
minorit" groups in this country“

“An All defeat.“ says Torres.
“could be taken as not only a boxing
defeat. btit a defeat of character. in-
telligence and importance. For
although Foreman is black himself.
he could offer only minor psy-
chological help to his people." (NY.
Post. Oct. 26. page 26)

The third reason why Ali should
win is because of that glamorous
quality which he so abundantly
possesses. His has been a youthful
vibrance which enthralled us and in
the process. revived the entire game
of boxing.

He challenged the odds in earlier
days. as any young person should.
The talent was there to back up his
brash statements. boy-t ever. and the
beauty wris there as well. The face
was smooth. the feet were light. and
the niusclcs rippch birt never bulg-
ed. as do the flesh of brutes.

If you remember back far enough.
Sonny Liston was once being called
the greatest heavyweight champ of
all time. and not just by promoters.
boxing greats such as Joe Louis.
.lack Dempsey. rind Gene ’l‘rrnncy
echoed this feeling. A young man
from Louisville said that he would
beat this “Big Ugly Bear". however.
and he did.

Ali is no longer a young man from
Louisville. by boxing standards.yct
he would have us believe that For-
rnan is just that ugly bear. waiting
again. |2ycars later. to be beaten by
a youthful knight renewing con-
quests of old.

It does not stand tip: nothing does
to time. l‘or all the reasons wiry Ali
should win there is one glaring
reason why he cart not: he is not the
lighter he was. there will be no

politics in (icorgc l-'orenttm‘s list. no

psychology. no glamour: just brute
strength hitting ri javv eigirt years
older than its own.

Ali's last great fight was the first

lhc light strangely liriishcd both
men. Alter it. Ira/,ier could rro
ongcr take it pitnclr. and sorircliovv'.
Ali could no longer give one. He
became hcsrtrrnl iii the ring; he no

Today. heisat timesthc Aliofold.
In sparringsessions he is as‘fast and
as sharp as ever. Make no mistake.
as Howard Cosell might say. he is
still one ofthe greates athletes of all
time.

Yet something happens when the
real bell sounds. The moments of
quickness and power become few. It
does not seem as ifthc desire to corn-
bat isthcrc; the fire is gone fromthe
eyes.

When desperate. it rcttrrns. He
won the last two rounds of the sc-
cond Ken Norton light because he
had to in order to rivoid losing the

face three inches overin the process.

before the ninth round started.
humiliated by his old rival. In the
next three minutes. he took Frazier
apart with left jabs. right crosses.
lhen he returned to lethargy. his
margin of victory secure.

He will need more than moments
of greatness. however. in order to
defeat Foreman and this he knows.
That is why he reconjurcs memories
ofthcpttst Liston lights when he now
talks: not for our benefit. brit for his.
lt willbc futile however. because that
fire of youth can not be rekindled

ant-en Finish Third 

"by George Mlller

The Eighth Annual Albany In-

vitational Cross-Country Run was
V held this past Saturday and it cer-

tainly lived up to its reputation as
one of the most colorful and exciting
meets of the year.

The race of tnost significance to
Albany fans. the varsity division.
was won going away by CW. Post.
as they racked up only 47 points. Sc-
tond place in the twenty school field
was triken by. I’lattsburgh with 80
and Albany Statcgrabbed third with
37. just edging out Colgate with 90.

"I think it went off unusually
great." exclaimed Coach Bob
Munsey. “It was a thrilling linish.
There was a real good crowd and.
well. it was the most pleasurcablc In-
vitational we‘ve ever had.“

Far and away the most outstan-
ding accomplishment of the meet
was the record breaking time of
senior John Biedrzycki of C.W.
Post. The talented senior ilew over
the 5.0 mile course with a display of
running that was simply a joy to
watch. The new mark of 24:35.9
shattered the old one by four
seconds. and allowed him to beat out
his closest competition. teammate

Mike Butyns. by a huge margin ot‘40

.1

seconds. 'l‘bat I-2 combination was
all l’ost needed to lock up the vie-
tory. so the real brittle was over 2nd
and 3rd and 401 positions.

I'lattsburgh was once again a shy
faster than Albany. Ilrtrcc 'l'caguc
ran a 25:25 for 3rd place and John
Evans ttrrncd iii a 25:27. good
enough for Stir. which allowed the
Cardinals from the north country to
snare 2nd place from the Danes.

Carlo ('herubino tttth) and Chris
llurns (9th) turned in excellent per-
formances clocking 25:38 and 25:40
respectively.

“Iturns is just ti lantastic little
devil." chuckled Munsey. "This is his
first time on the course rtrrdcr fire
this year and his best time last year
was 26:52. We're talking a minute
plus which is great. llrcy both ran
absolutely lantiistic." Vinny Reda
complemented the front running
duo with art ||tlr place liniin via a
25:4l.

"I was personally ilitpt‘csscd wit h it
lot of things." continued Munsey.
"llrian Davis linished 22nd with a
Ztizll as a lrcshrnrin. Ihis was
tremendous," l’rcvrotrsly'. his best
time had been Ztizﬁll.

Perhaps the otic thing that did the
most damage to the Danes was a

chosen instead is very real.

"We can only really psyche

Coach. “We‘ve had them: Army.

If things do work out like
everyone hopes. it good showing in
the Nationals would be a very nice
topping to the cake. Regardless. with
the top caliber of competition that
the cross-country team faces. it‘s cer-
tainly' been an amazing year. and
that‘s a claim that few other SUNYA
teams can make.
