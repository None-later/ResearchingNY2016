[It began one early evening in the
summer of I964. Frederic Storaslta
witnessed the brutal rapeand assault
of a young girl by a gang of teenage
boys. He immediately fought off the

assailants but thegirl. though at least v

saved, had been seriously injured.
With this shocking experience in
his memory. Storaska traveled to
many Universities seeking informa-
tion on rape and assault. To his sur-

* {on-Rope to 

, prise Storaslta found that this was a

taboosubject and little research had
been done. It was mention he decid-
ed to devote his energies to un-
derstanding and solving this
problem. -

In November of I964. Storask
made his first presentation on rape
prevention to a private woman‘s
college. This was to be the beginning
of eight years on the college circuit
for the rape expert.

Twelve weeks after his ﬁrst speech .

a young woman testified for the
prosecution that her life had been
saved by Storaska‘s "information.
Many other cases and examples
have been given and veriﬁed by the
proper authorites.

Storaska‘s lecture is designed to

Fred Star-alto: rape prevent".
provide both men and women witha
realistic understanding of the
problem. He will prepare women
with the psychological and physical
techniques necessary in case of a
possible attack. Deploringthc usual
scare tactics usually used. Storaska
creates an atmosphere where rape
can be disucsscd freely and effective
ly.

Storaska‘sstylc combincdwith his
wealth of information will hopefully
install confidence in women for
handling rape cases.

‘ In may I972. Storaska founded
the National Organization for the
Prevention of Rape and Assault. He
directs the activites of the organiza-
tion with lhc help of volunteers.

In the past cight years. Storaska
has lectured to more than a million
students at over 400 colleges many

Food co-op member selects produce.

by Kathy Johnson

The OffCumpus Student Co-op is presently suppor-
ting a food co-op which is run by the 8th Step Coffee

House.

The O.C.S.C.. a newly formed group which seeks to
improve conditions for Albany State students who live
off campus. urges commuters to become involved in this
organization. The food co-op hopes to provide a viable
alternative to the rising costs and the preservative laden
foods found in the local supermarket.

The idea behind the food co-op is simple.‘l‘brough the
combined efforts of the members ofthc co-op. food is
obtained in large quantities directly from local farmers.
By eliminating the middle man they are able to purchase
food at wholesale prices and to pass on the savings to its

members. Not only are the prices lmver. but tltc food
' obtained is fresher and much of it is organically grown.
claim food co-opcrs.

Io become a member of the food co-op. oirc should
come to thc tilh Step Coffee House located on l4 Willctt
St. any l'ucsday afternoon between four and six o'clock.
l’lrcrc one may pick up a form to order food for thc
Iollowing wcck. ()rr the order form will be the name and
address ol the “litrrrily” in charge for that week. lirich
member must turn his order blank arid money in to the
Co-op organi/crs by the next Sunday. and on the follow-
ing lircsday he can pick tip his order at the hilt Step
Collcc “trust: between 4:00 arid (villi). As rt rncmbcr ofthc
co-op a student will provide his services and time every
few weeks by picking tip or distributing the food.

The following is a list of the food that was available

kuelin this past week. Items and prices may vary slightly from

week to week according to availability.
