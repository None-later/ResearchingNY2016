United Way. a> charitable
ganization which donates money
tOf other] organizations, began its
campaign at Albany State under the
direction of Chairperson Lee Ann
‘1 Roberts. This is the first-times cam-
paign Of this sort was conducted by
students on a University campus.
- United 'Way serves 32 agencies in
. Albany. including Boys Clubs,’ Girls
Clubs. LaSalIc School. adoption
agencies, and homes for unwed
mothers. United Way :works ex-
clusively for non-profit
organizations.
An organization wishing to apply
to United Way for funds must have
'their financial status evaluated by
United Way beforehand. Their
financial standing is compared with
other groups of a similar type to see
ifthere isamplejustification for their
receiving financial aid. United Way
will send one of their representatives

to determine whether the group is g

spending their funds wisely. Once
the group is judged eligible. the Un-
ited VWay‘s Board Of Directors
decides how much and what percen-
tage the organization will recieve.

‘work‘ing expenses. Roberts referred
[to thisas “slush money.” Most of the
money received goes back to the
agencies.‘

Because of the tight money situa-
tion, the date for the fund drive has
been extended to November 8. Nor-
mally. the drive ends sometime in
October.

Roberts emphasized that no
group or organization Is given
money arbitrarily. She said that
there are strict rules governing their
acceptance. The process is “very
conscientious.“

Betty Herzog and Randy Gardner
are the faculty representatives forthe
United Way campaign. Roberts'
works side by side with these faculty
members to solve matters such as
finances.

8.50 from Garcia

by Brent Klgner _ v ,  - ..

Alton Smith —the SUNYA student who was allegedly beaten
by police. then convicted for his attempts to resist them—wait disappointed
Wednesday night as Central Council voted unanimously to alloy/50¢ refunds
on all tickets to the Garcia-Saunders con‘c’ert. ' ‘

Fifty cents out of each ticket sold had been earmarked by University Con-
cert Board for the Alton Smith Defense Fund. It was Council's position that
such a donation represented an abridgement of studeiits‘ rights since.
although purchase of each ticket was voluntary. the appended charge was
not.

The difficulty stemmed partly from the fact that Solicitations Committee
had approved a plan whereby students would have an option of paying the
extra fee. while UCB believed that a single indivisible price would be charged.
In response to charges that UCB‘s practice may establish an unwholesome
precedent. Student Association President Curran asked that the case be con-
sidercd on its own merits. SA Veep lrii Hirnbaum reported that Smith‘s
lawyers feel they have found legal grounds for several thisconvicitons. and
lack of funds remains the only roadblock to his appeal.

A verbal endorsement of the United Farmworkers‘ Boycott passed after it
was decided that no student funds would be spent on publicizing that en-
dorsement. the resolution asks that students boycott Gallo wines. grapes
and Price Chopper supermarkets. which continue to market non-union
products. Council felt that it would be unwise to permit the $25 appropria-
tion to make its endorsement known to students since such an expenditure
may be construed its political. thus constituting a violation of 'I'rustces‘
policy.

In what appears to he a proliferating practice in Council. “objections to
consideration" were moved on four separate bills. This motion. which is
generally reserved lor hills which are considered so obnoxious deserve im-
mediate LIL‘ICill without debate. passed on two of the four bills. ()neol the two

“We will keep a close eye on the
effect these regulations will have."
said Bunis. “We assume everything

While these regulations are
written in the class schedule the
registrar feels. by the Questions they
receive. that most students do not
bother to read them. “We are trying
to start it public relations I 'v
In order to keep the student aware of
these regulations.“» explained Bunis.
“For the first time." said Bunis.
"there will be the distribution of stu-
dent data forms. The University is

‘ required by law to solicit this infor-

mation." “It: forms ask the student
to give his name. social security

applicable. veterans information.

responding if the student chooses to
do so.
