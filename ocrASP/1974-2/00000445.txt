Behe‘was never within reach. and no one could say that there was light at the end of
the tunnel. but the action by the Arabisummit in Rabat this past week has all but
assured the doom of any planned peace conference in Geneva. By acknowledging’ihe
Palestine Liberation Organization. moderate Arab leaders have subjugated their own
interests to‘,those of a universally recognized band of terrorists._A political settlement
now between Israel-and her- Arab enemies is more remote than at any time since the
I967 war. ' ' g

The P.L.0.' has never proven that a majority of Palestinians favors them as their
bargaining agent. Jordanian King Hussein. until Tuesday the sole source of resistance
to the terrorists” demands. had offered to allow a general referendum of Palestinians to
determine exactly where their sympathy lies. But the Arabs have shown their true
colors with this latest dangerous move. The P.L.O. has constantly called for the exter-
mination of Israel. and they have reiterated their pledge that they will not stop their
“holy war“ until all of Israel is “returned” to the Palestinians.

It then becomes impossible to believe Egyptian President Sadat that he irulysceks a
diplomatic settlement with his neighbor. that he doesn‘t intend. as he as so often been
charged. to push all of Israel into the Mediterranean. Granting the P.L.0. the statusas
"sole representative“ of the Palestinian interests substitutes the goal ofa political peace,
with that of unrelenting and proliferating war. The irresponsibility demonstrated by
the Arabs since last October. and the total disregard in which they hold the rest of the

'world threatens the security and fragile peace that has existed so far.

The week‘s developments have also re-opcned the wounds only partially healed by
the Nixon detente with the Soviet Union. The Soviets. seeing their opportunity to
reasscrt their power in the Middle East will no doubt re-arm their Arab allies. with ever
more modern and deadly weaponry. They are content with the knowledge that the new
confident Arabs have only to win a war with lSl‘Ilel once. Unfortunately. this places the
United States in a position from which it cannot retreat. We must. without wavering.
and with increasing determination protect. and if necessary. arm Israel in order to. as
Nixon correctly put it. "tip the balance Israel‘s favor." They cannot afford to be
trusting. they cannot afford to lose.

The United States has a number of devices at its disposal to execute such a policy.
Our policy of even-handedncss. which until now has reekcd of Chitnibcrlainesque:
appeasement. will have to be aborted until’lhe’A‘rab world turns again toward settle—
tnent. The power of trade with the Soviets will have to be used as a pressure tool to con-
vincc the Soviets not to arm their Arab friends. Such a concession on their part will
relieve this country of the painful and reluctant task of feeding fuel to the fire. The Uti-
itcd States has. since October of last year. consistently taken the lead in attempting to
work out a settlement. and has proved itselfwitliout question on the side of’diplomacy.
Unfortunately. the Soviets cannot make a similar claim.

The $2.5 billion Arab war chest should be a glowing reminder that the Middle East
will not achieve peace through its own means. and it is now up to the superpowers to
keep the peace.

Trick or Treat

The bags were a little cmptier last night. the smiles just a little less broad. Children in
their annual Metamorphosis. hit the streets across the country injoyous celebration of
Halloween. It is inconsequential that children have no idea of how Halloween
originated. It is equally unimportant that adults know little of the message of the occa -
sion. What has always been at the heart of the holiday is the laughter ofchildrcn. who.
this year. cannot understand why it is that Halloween wasn‘t as much fun asitwas fast

car.

But. what do child rcn know of recessions? Indeed. why should they care about war
and economics? For them. as it always should be. Halloween is a time for children to
have fun. to yell “Trick or Treat" and to get candy. Only candy is too expensive and
many people can‘t afford to give as much. But how can we explain the world‘s troubles
to the children? It is their holiday and it seems cruel to ruin it for them.

The laughs were a little more subdued this year.

An Interview 08W ‘ 

New C

by Myron E. Bruin

New to Albany State, but by no means new to
music, Stephen Osmond now has the job of
director of choral studies. He is young. He is
experienced. A ml he is hope/id. A onetime ac»
tor. opera singer, high school teacher. Os-
mond. takes on a position which hisformer
predecessors have brought honors in their
students both here in New York and oversees
as well.

During the course of the interview, Mr. Os-
ntmid seemed quite at ease. in [but he
sutiictitiiar spoke niutter-ojlj'actlv. He is well
11/) on current trends and ideas in music and
has a deep understanding of the choral tradi-
tion. By his manner. one would get the impres-
.i‘luti that lie was at home with music. To say
that llt‘ is businesslike would he [0 neglect his
l)(’ll(‘l' hall. the half that represents the joy of
music. H Iii/rash ideas and approach are much
welcomed. and his concerts will certainly be
.ronictliing to watch uutﬁir.

Q. You seem I0 be a busy man.

A. I am.

Q. What have you been doing?

A. Well...l‘ve been trying to make music.
that‘s what I‘ve been doing.

Q. I understand Ilia! you have some concerts
muting up.

A. Well the 26th (November) with the

Chamber Choir and thL4tthDccember with . 
the University Chorale and the'ghést shot by“; A

the University Wind Ensemble doing the
Shoenberg Variations. The programs are kind
of linked in the sense that they‘re part of the
Shoenberg-lvcs-Holst centennial. Since all
three of them were born in I874. and it's in-
teresting because there‘sa completely different
variety of' styles. th rce people couldn't be more
opposite. Geographically they are a cross sec-
tion...

Q. Tell "It! about yourself. Where have you
studied and in I/ilrlll?

A. I did my undergraduate work at
Northwestern. I spent five years teaching in
High School and college out there. lspent two
years at Yale studying conducting and voice.
Q. Were you originally interested in voice?
A. Well. I was originally interested in music
and theatre and voice. conducting and acting.
l was a professional actor for a while. I have a
pretty broad spectrum. The only thing I‘m not
too interested in is composition.

Q. Do you we pnd'c.r.rionul choruses develop-
ing (Is (I thing 0/ tlic_/iititrc?

A. Yes and no. My answer is bascd on what I
want to see. I think they should bearound tea
certain extent. but I certainly don‘t think they
should take over.

Q. What do you think til'muxlc critics?

A. I look at reviewers as another man‘s opi-
nion. and just because he happens to put it into
a newspaper doesn‘t make any difference to
me.

choral music? Do you get the impression that
choral music plays a minor role in music?
A. Not at all. The repertoire is much larger for
choral singing than it is for orchestral. I mean
without exception. take any composer and
compare the amount of performance time of
his symphonies to the choral works. Well take
Bach. Look at the cantatas. They‘re basically
choral. Brahms even. four symphonies. The
Requiem. Nanie . the Motets. The literature is
more abundant with choral music. Instrumen-
tal is just an imitation of choral music. That‘s
how it came about. If people have a preference
for one or the other it‘s just because they‘ve
beard different levels of performance.

 

 

‘People think that

iust because they're
singing with a hundred
and twenty five others,
their part is not very
significant.

.ltnis. more significant.’

 

 

 

Q. How do you like being here?

A. Well. that‘s sort ofa typicalquestion that I
get asked a lot. There‘s a lot of good things to
say about it and there‘s a lot of bad things to
say about it. I think positively. I enjoy it. I‘m
still here.

Q. What do you like about it?

A. I‘ve enjoyed the contact that I‘ve had with
the students so far. They seem eager and in-
terested in the material. Their backgrounds
are very diversified as far as the depth of un-
derstanding they have of music. especially
vocal. That‘s been very positive. The facilities
are good. There‘s a few things that could be
improved.

Q. What don’t you like? What problems do
you face?

A. The basic problems that face anybody.
The economic situation the way it is. we have
to cut a lot of corners as far as programs.
they're just too expensive. There‘s a lot of red
tape . there‘s a lot of red tape everywhere. I‘ve
kind of inherited a situation where people
don‘t understand the importance of rehear-
sals. how important they are. I think an at-
titude that has been allowed to exist around
here is sort ofa come and do your thing and if
you can‘t make it that‘s fine. Some people. a
very small minority of people. could be a little
more committed to their decision to be in-
volved inchoralmusic. Theydon‘t take it quite

seriously. People think that because they're
singing with a hundred and twenty-ﬁve other
people that their part isn‘t very much signifi-
cant. lt‘s more signiﬁcant. There is that much
more chance for error so they have to bethat'
much more prepared. .
Q. - What do you try to do as a conductor?
What are your aims and goals?
A. Well. basically three. One. to represent the
music as it is intended to be presented. Thus is
not the order of importance. The next.
probably the most important. is to be able to
convey what is it in the music to the ensemble.
to make sure whoever is singing or playing
(I‘ve done a lot oforcliestral conducting too).
that they are understanding what is coming ,
out of that piece ofpaper in front ofthem. that
they have an intellectual. and emotional. and a
musical response to what‘s written down—an
accurate one. It‘s not just playing a bunch of -
notes. The third is creating an exciting. in- v
teresting. and dynamic. I don‘t mean that in :
the sense of forceful. but just in a sense ofat-
mosphere for an audience. and cntertainingd
think a concert should be enjoyable.
Q. What do you .i't’t’ as the relationship
between choral conducting and orchestra!
cmtducti‘un? Are there any differences
possibly."
A. Basically. no. You got to know your
ensemble. how to get the sound out of it. You
have to know the music. Ninety percent of
conducting is studying scores. So that‘s the
same for both. The difference breaks down to
mainly choralconductors should havea good
background in voice. and an orchestral con-
ductor should have a background in most of
the instruments. A good conductor should
know both.

 

‘A lot of people
are turning to music.

Choral music
is an excellent outlet.’

 

 

 

Q. What directions. would you .my choral
tiiuslc is moving in."

A. 'I'herc‘sa lot more attention being paid to
contemporary music. 'I'licrcarc choirs that are
getting into the stylistic. concentrating more
on renaissance pieces or contemporary pieces
interested in Batch. which in an academic situa-
tion. I‘m not particularly sold on. because I
think it should be a pretty good representation
from each stylistic period. Some choirs I know
of spend the whole year on one program of all
contemporary music. That‘s a waste oftime as
far as I‘m concerned. I think people are reser-
ving more free time. spare time. and people all

Q. How do you think most people: regard-

acrosii the country are becoming more in-
volved in creating some kind of activities for
their leisure time. And a lot of people are tur-
ning to music. Choral music iii an excellent
outlet. '

'Why shouldn't a child
be’ taught to reocl'music

 

at the some time as
he is taught to read-
his native tongue?

 

 

 

‘Q. Li going to choral concerts more popular
these dam."

' A. I think so. yeah. In New Haven they‘re

very popular. New York has all kinds ofchoral
concerts going on all the time. They have a
very good audience. There‘sa lot of publicity
going into it. What a lot of schools are doing
now is that they‘re putting a lot ofimportanee
on sort of a liberal arts framework. And I
think they‘re trying to develop audience. as
well as performers. but a lot ofthe thrust now
is going into developing the audience. which is
really good and I think is showingaffect by in-
creasing audiences. But. generally. people are
getting a better music background at the un—
iversity level. In the elementary and high
school levels. there‘s a lot of room for im-
provement. I think choralconcerts are becom-
ing more interesting. People are trying to do a
program where multi-media things are in-
volved. doing more things with orchestra in-
stead ofjust piano or acappella. Acuppefla
singing doesn‘t turn too many people on. It
has a place. but it‘s pretty boring.
Q. What do you think of music t'tlttt‘dlftlll on
tho clciiictituijr and high school levels."
A. Well I think it‘s suffering. lthink it‘s poor-
ly funded. poorly taught. and the method of
teaching music teachers has to be drastically
improved. That‘s the first step. And finding
your good musicians and making them in-
terested in teaching at lower levels. because
that‘s where this country in particular suffers.
There are exceptions. There area lot of very.
very fine elementary school teachers. General-
ly there‘s not enough time given to it in the
curriculum and there‘s not enough teachers
available to do thcjob effectively. An excellent
example is: why shouldn‘t a child be taught to
read music at the same timelie‘s taught to read
his native longuc'.’ Music. just as much as a
native tongue. is the language of expression.
Q. How about IlIll.\lt' u.r a discipline."
A. It‘sfiiscinatingasiidiscipline.Itdisciplines
time. space. It‘s not two dimensional as
traditional disciplines. It has to do with
physical. oral. hearing. fingers. breathing.
Music is very healthy.
