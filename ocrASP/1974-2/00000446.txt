 Game}

by Paul Pellpli
“George. lets go to the track
tonight. I havea littleextra money.”
"We can‘t. Elliot and Carlos are
coming over to play poker. You’can
try to break your losing strait.” '

This must seem like a harmless
conversation between two men who
sometimes pass their time gambling.
Most people gamble now and then.
but some get hooked. One time leads
to another and another till the track
or casino is the most likely place to
ﬁnd a person.

A recently released motion picture
that deals with this vice is The
Gambler. which stars James Caan.
Gambling is a popular topic for ﬁlm-
makers this year. Another ﬁlm of
this type is The California Split
which was directed by Robert Alt:
man.

Thr’ Gambler is a very powerful
ﬁlm that hits the viewer like a jab
below the belt. Caan portrays an
English professor at a New York
City college who leaves his
classroom raps on Doestoevsky and
heads to a gambling parlor. At the
start of the film he gets set back $44.-
000. Where is he going to get this
money“! From his mom. the doctor.

The unlucky prof. takes the
money and his girl to Vegas and
doubles it. Slowly we ﬁnd that Caan
gets a bigger rush out of losing than
winning. My most frequent ex-

clamation throughout the ﬁlm was.

“What a sick guy he is.“

Without a doubt. this is Caan‘s
best acting to date. He's very
believable as the spoiled. fatherlcss
young man whose obvious in-
telligence. good looks and athletic
abilities cannot counteract his driv-
ing urge to place his resourceson the
line. His compulsive behavior leads
to a lack of sensitivin on his pan.
One of the heaviest scenes is when he
tries to make lotc to his girlfriend
(played by Lauren Hutton). after he
has blown all his Gish on abasketball
game. Heseems to enjoy the fact that
she is unreceptivc and her aloofness
serves as a catalyst for his per-
sistance.

As faras the former covergirl‘s ac-
ting. all I can say is: she looks good.
Hutton and Cybil Shepard should
go back to the cover oi
Cosmopolitan.

The (jumble! realistically con-
structs oncof the \ ices thatour way
of lilc leads us to espouse. If you
hate :1 relative who is a bunny
gambler.and a loser. it will make as
strong an impression as itdid on me.

The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3

by Eri Lindauer

Four armed men hijack a New York City subway
train. Ridiculous, yet, in The Taking of Felham One Two
Three. an unusual new adventure film, they almost pull it
off. The idea of hijacking a subway train and holding its
passengers for a ransom is far fetched, even for New
York City. but director Joseph Sargent is able to make it
work.

The ﬁlm is unusual as it is not simply a portrayal ofa
chain of violent acts by desperate men. but also one of
the few perceptive, humorous portraits of city existence
since Little Murders.

F0ur men. alias Blue (Robert Shaw). Green (Martin
Balsam). Grey (Hector Elizondo) and Brown (Earl
Hind man), take control of a Pelham Number 6 subway
train at gunpoint. They stall the ﬁrst car in a tunnel and
deliver an ultimatum to city ofﬁcials: the city must
provide them a million dollars within an hour. One
passenger will be shot for every minute the city is late
with the money

Enter Transit Authority Police Lieutenant Garher
(Walter Matthau). With methodical efﬁciency he
struggles to mobilize all of the citydepanments to insure
the safety of the passengers. The difﬁculties in ﬁghting
the city bureaucracy fast enough to raise the ransom
money provide a medium for Matthau and the others to

GR

exercise their talent for humor.

Pelham substantially reproduces the comic iron)
which often pervades city government. The absurdity oi
a mayor. worrying more about what the city newspupm
will say about his decision to pay the ransom thrrn lltt.‘
lives of the hostages. strikes a familiar notc.

Although containing many humorous elements. the
focus of the film is dramatic. The ability of dircclor
Sargent to combine the two elements without confusion
is ottc of thelilm‘s many asscsts. it is in this area that
many similar “adventure ﬁlms" suffer.

'l'crror felt by the hostages facingan uncertain future 1.
transmitted with a haunting realism. The frustration lcll
by Lt. (iurbcr as ltc tries to outgucss thc "ﬂawless" pltllls
of the hijackers becomes that of the viewer.

True to recent trends the ﬁlm contains the cxpcctcd
car 'chasc‘. In this particular setting. the race ls tigurrm
the clock. with police ofﬁcials making it desperate
attempt to race the necessary ransom money ncnm
town in time to meet the hijacker‘sdcadlinc. Visually L‘\-
citing and dramatically correct. the success of the chase
lies' in the fact that it remains simplya part ofa wholc pic-
turc. and is not merely an axis around which all other
cvents in the film revolve.

It is. the combination of Pelham's humor and drama
that combine to make it one of the most ctllcrlltlnlllg
adventure films recently produced.

. Anderson has made his departure
from the forty-ﬁve minute song; War
Child is a series of short songs
related in theme, a step backward
from Passion Play. Anderson seems
to be searching for new directions.

traditional album concept (as well as
the traditional concept album) as a
means of retracing his steps back to
his starting point.

From Al technical point of view,

Bowie Vs. Bleeps

We would like to publicly thank the
management of WAST-TV for
protecting our morals and virtues
from the horrendous onslaught of
filth and degradation that spewed
forth from the mouth of that bi-
sexual pervert David llowic.

Bowie and his band. The Spiders
Front Mars. were shown Sunday
night in thcirltist concert together. It
was an excellent show. but only due
to thc thankless efforts of those
wonderful (iod-fcttring ladies and
gentlemen tll \VAS’l'.

Willll u plcttsurc to hear the high-
pitcltcd. grating. L'tll‘ shattering tone
of the met-watchful censor as Bowie
cxcrctcd such obscenitics its Ir-u‘h.
u lr-rc, rr-.\. and n-Ii-rrr li-rn thank you
rnu'rrm.’ As CllCll resounding bleep
coursed through our skulls. our
hearts filled with pride that we were
Americans. and we rejoiced in the
knowledge that. once more. blows
wcrc being struck in lhc name of
purity. innocence and Mom's apple
pie.

If not for the unfailing efforts of
WASl. our lovely little town of
Albany would have been caught up
in it wave of unlcashcd sexual
hysteria (of an intensity ttcvcr hcforc
cxpcricnccd by man!) caused by the
unsavory utterances of David
Howie.

bcautilul pcuplc for saving thc lives
of our sweet children. sparing them
