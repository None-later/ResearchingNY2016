The idea behind the french defense
is to obtain a temporarily cramped
position while working for an even-
tual center break and making
judicious development moves.

The cute little gem that follows
seemed natural to show to our
readers. It wasn‘t very well played by
black, but white took advantage of
every mistake. This makes the game
instructional in that is shows how
one wrong move in the french
defense can lead to its destruction at
an early stage in the game.

Notes: a) 3. N-QZ maintains tension
