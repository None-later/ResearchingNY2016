On Tuesday night ldecided to give
up watching Zorro and M‘A'S'H
to go. see Cicely Tyson in the Gym. I
felt I was in for a very stimulating

Let me ﬁrst start though. with the
good parts. Ms. Tyson is a stunning
woman and an excellent speaker.
The ﬁrst half of her program was
used as a question and answer
period. She ﬁelded allquestionswith
honesty, wit, and humor. Most of

do anything. Itisup to the individual
to stop paying for the trash. or turn
off the T.V.- set.- '

Another question asked eoneem-
ed her preference as to which
medium she prefers perfroming in:
live theatre. movies or television.
Most actors and actresses I‘ve found
have always preferred one over the
other. Ms. Tyson felt that any
medium where she can get a part she
wants is alright. She doesn‘t really
prefer one over the other.

After about thirty minutes. she
began dramatic readings and poetry.
She is without a doubt a fantastic ac-
tress. She was able to create a mood
and hold it. Her characters seemed
to show through and she gave an ex-
cellent performance. She is probably
one of the greatest actresses alive to-
day.

Her choieeofmaterial is where my
gripe begins. I felt as if I was being
put down for one half of an hour.
Must. not all. but most of her
readings made the white race look

very racist in nature. Ase white sttt- "
dent I went to the gym to see herper-
form as an actress. not to be told how.
inhuman my race supposedly is. lfelt
very uncomfortable sittingthere.

I was surprised at how few blacks
were there. I guess this may be why I
thought that she was going to treat
us to a glimpse of her dramatic skill
and not her views ofblack troubles.

As a critic it is my perogative to
write what 1 fed. CicelyTyson seems
to be a line person. She has a lovely
personality and is a great actress, I
feel she could have and should have
used a littlemorc tact in choosingher
material.

The Poet’s Boast
552$:WW5W4M

Roman poets are not known for
their humility. To the contrary. they
.were sometimes given to boasting. III
the epilogue ‘ to his
“Metamorphoses” the poet Ovid (43
ll.C. - [7 AD.) utters this boast:

“Now l have completed my work.
which neither Jupiter‘s wrath. nor
l'ire.nor sword.nor hungry time will
be able to destroy. There is that day
which has no power except over my
body. l.cl that day. whenever it
dcsrr'cs. put an end to my life's uncer-
trrin spam. Yet. the better part of me.
e\ cr'lttsting. will be borne high above
the stairs. and my name will never be
tor‘gntrcn. Wherever Roman power
extends o\ cr conquered lands. there
I shall hc read by the pcoplennd. if
there isirny truth to the prophecies of
bards. i shall “H: by my lirmc
through it” centuries."

Curiously enough. Ovid‘s boast
has rrrorc than enmetrtte. His \tor'ks
are read in many countries that \\ crc
ne\cr undcr Roman r'trlc. He is
probably thc most poprrlnr ol’
Romain poets in this country.
Modern readers lik‘c his lrtrnkncss.
