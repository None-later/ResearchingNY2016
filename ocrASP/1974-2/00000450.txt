milar Mobil commentary has been printed in local
on explanation for our energy problems. This laiest

The Mobil rebuttal declares energy conservation as “but: word" which really represents more

government control and loss of freedom of our American life-style. The article. entitled “Energy

. ..(lrowth or Economics Stagnation.‘2 goes on to equate energy conservation with rationing. .‘lfhc

Mobil solution is not to disturb‘the American lifestyle (gluttonous. unnecessary waste) but
rather to ensure supplies of new energy by eliminating government control and reducing en-
vironmental standards. ‘ ' ‘ ‘ ~

From the Frog's Mouth resents Mobil Oil's arrogant policy of neglect towards environmental
values. How does the Mobil rebuttal deal with environmental concerns? Perhaps the most am—
biguous phrase in this and‘ other anti-environmentalist articles is its use ol‘ the word
"rwonable." “We favor full'pub'lic discussion and we want every reasonable protection for tlte
environment.” the report explains. What Mobil considers "reasonable environmental protec-
tion” is not substantiated upon in the article. V

The article concludes with a list of suggestions it believes would ease the energy situation (or.
as F TF M thinks. at least ease Mobil Oil‘s situation). Among these suggestions is the following:

“Retain desirable environmental objectives. but review the timetable for reaching thcnt in the

. Great idea! First. eliminate those environmental values Mobil Oil feels are “undesirable”
(Whichever they are): then take those environmental values considered important and look at
them in terms of our short-term crisis. What would be the result of this policy? You guessed it,

.we‘d have a near total neglect oi‘environmental concems. a later change in life-style (not because

ol‘ energy conservation as Mobil believes. but because of energy abuse) and a huge bill to help
pick upthe pieces ol‘our environmental neglect. (Will Mobil Oil chip in?)

Your dissent. themMobil Oil is an attempt to blame environmentalists and proponents of
energy conservation for our energy crisis. Next time. don‘t shower us with your social commen-
tary and public relations mumbo-jumbo and just come out and say what you really mean.
