A few days before his fight with
Muhammad Ali. George Foreman
called Zaire “the cradle of
Freedom.” He stood by these words
of innocence. and a few nights later.
he fell by them.

Foreman went to great lengths to
assimilate himself into the Zairois'
culture. Around his training camp.
or while sight-seeing over this new
land. he would wear the colorful
robes and jewelry of the natives.

Even more. be portrayed himself
as the great African warrior. and the
people loved him for it. At the pre-
Iight weigh-in. he kept his face like
stone. and every now and then raised
his huge arm and fist into the air. to
signify he was ready for combat,

Ashcdid.thcdrumsand shoutsot‘
12.000 people in attendance picked
up. It was no wonder that Foreman
would receive the bigger ovation. of
the two contestants. whcn ltc stepped
into the ring for thc dcfcnsc of his
world-hwvywcight crown.

The people of Zarirc. it seems. have
great feelings for their culturc. 'l‘ribtrl
rites and dances ttrc rcinzrctcd daily.
in order that the people may l'ccl
honor and pride in their bcginnings.
Symbols of strength and courtrgc.
above all. are respected. This is one
rctrson why President Mobutu Scsc
Scko (meaning “the all powerful
warrior. who. because of his inflcxi-
blc will to win. willgo from conquest
to conquest. lcttving fire in his
wake") brought the two grctttcst
lighters in the world-to his loud to do
htrttlc.

Foreman l'illcd tltc bill as divine
innocent. Ali did not. Although
rtcknowlcdgcd its the grcrrtcr block
lctrdcr. Ali confused many of tltc
people with his antics. l-Ic l'okcd hills

in workouts. pretended to behurt.
pretended to cry. .

. He joked about rumbles in the
jungle. rrnd voodoo dolls in
Forcmon‘s image with pins in them.
He wore is light brown suit with it
high buttoned Vtrn Hucscn shirt. He
seemed to be. more and more. an
American.

All is tr black American who un-
dcrstunds whtrt the nation onaircis
today. He sees that the people do
their dances in neon-lit soccer
studiums. that their president rides
to that stadium in It Mercedes.

    Proves It,Again  HeIS

for a living can be. in his fight against
George Foreman. ~

As his opponent attempted to
plant his gaze upon him before the
bottle begun. he teased him. and
Foreman lowered his hood. his one
psychological weapon lost.

The first round set the stage for the
fight. Ali. who was supposed to
move. did not. He lay against the
ropes. Forcmttn. who was then sup-
posed to connect. did not - at least
Rot to any spot where he could hurt

sion. .

The Zuirois did not in until the
ﬁfth round. Wednesday morning.
Then they began to appreciate his
ruthless effectiveness. For at that
time they began to see a change come
over the face of George Forcman.‘

A glaze of fear appeared. ever so
slowly. It wusa realization ofdcfcnt.
that he was losing dcspitc his
strength and courage. It was like
King Kong. atop the tallest building.
now realizing that those damned
sneaky little planes were actually
toppling him from his throne.

The scent: grew sud. in tr way. as
lofts trnd rights shot into Forcman‘s
disbeiicving face. The ﬁlm was Ali's
bcst round. as be connected from
beginning to end. The shouts of
"Alccc Bommcrtril" (“A|i. kill").
sporadic art the tight‘s outset. now
grew l'rcqucnt and constant.

At the cnd of the round. Ali‘s
trttincr. Angelo Dundcc. run ovcr to
thc closcd-circuit microphone trnd
shouted. "My mun will ltlkc him out
in four rounds. I'our rounds!" 'l‘hc
shouts continued. loudcr.

Yet the cntclcst treatment of ttll.
was Ali‘s. Hc dodged once in thc six-
th. and Foreman missed so com-
pletely thrrt his body almost toppled
out of thc ring. The chomp then
sccmcd to paw at him. hoping to
avoid further disasters.

Still. however. In the sixth and
seventh rounds. thcjubs of Ali con-
ncctcd. shooting l-‘orcmun‘s hcad

pion hard given up thctrsstrult on Ali‘s

sides. which somehow I'ltm’rbed
tremardous‘ amounts of punish-
mentn '

The end came in the eighth with
Foremen's arms now too weary to
sustain a counter attack. As he was
struck by yet another right, his head
fell over the top rope. and in the split
second it hung unguarded. was met '
by another blow. .

As hc lifted it back to the ring a left
jolted it; then as it ducked down a
right uppercut. He tried to remove it.
but Ali‘s coo! efﬁciency of punches
scored each time.

He straightened now. but a sharp
left jolted him upwards on his toes.
and before he completely descended
inguin. a brutal right had struck solid-
ly. Hc staggered to his right fora mo-
mcnt tls the fall to the canvas began.
