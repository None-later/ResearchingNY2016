“Let me thank all those in New

emotionless Clark. His concession
speech. and his campaign speeches

"Let me thank the more than 40.-

Clark ran his campaign with the

called an attempt to liberate the

about a ten per cent margin. “Why

porter complained.

"I fixed a goal and worked it [win-
ning]. but winning isn‘t everything.

iYou have to stand for something."

Yet. perhaps the lesson to he
learned from this campaign is that
integrity and stI'aighl-forwardness
are not as valuable as big money and
machine support.

Clark hit his high point shortly

instead of standing on a highway, catching
the breeze as the cars pass you by at 55 mph,
you could be catching our car. Amtrak may not
be as cheap as hitching. But for the little
money you spend, you get a lot more in return.
Nowhere else but on an Amtrak train do
you get so much room along the way.
We give you the biggest seat in travel. With
more space around it. too.
From our picture windows, we give you
the kind ofclose-up view of America you
can't get from highways and cloudbanks.
You can get a different point of view.
too. from the people you meet
on the train. Since there are no seat belts
to hold you back on Amtrak.
you can roam the train from car to car.
Maybe grab something to drink
at the snack bar or lounge car. And

On crossvcountry trips, you can stop oil along
the way anywhere you like. Then
board another train later with
I the same ticket.
