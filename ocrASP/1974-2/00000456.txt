Nelson Rockefeller‘s chances of
being confirmed for the nation's se-
cond highest office are ﬂoundering.
Many of the Senatorsand Represen-
tatives are who will have to judge

timillionuirc‘s immense financial

Critics of his confirmation argue

would be lln opportunity to exercise
power to eliminate competition in

Rodino remarked that he is not

that Rockel‘cllcr‘s wealth and in- ‘

llucncc are dangerous in the hundsof

office combined with his money are
iiol amenable with democracy,
critics urgue.

Both the House of Represen-
llilivcs and the Senate must approve
Rockcl'cllcr‘s Vice-Presidential
nomination by a majority vote.

by Beverly Hearn

Guy Jones. Director of the Com- .
munity Legal Rights Foundation.
Inc.. of Albany. has been living in
Albany on $50a week. Hcexplained
the Foundation‘s programs and ser-
vices. the results of which are ade-
quate payment to him for the ser-
viccs he renders.

The Foundation. located at 38
Chapel Street in downtown Albany.
is a legal advocacy group that works
for people in the community in their
interaction with thejudicittl system.
Founded in December 197] they
provide legal aid to the poor.

One of their programs is the In-
dependent Community Lawyers
Program. This makes litigation
available to tllc poor at no fee. ' ”

'l‘hc Community Lawyers
Program has distinct advantages
over other programs available to
Albany County residents. For exam-
plc. the public defendcr‘s office is
only pnrt-limc and operates on a
rotating blisisuis a result. there is no
regular continuity of service to a
client. The chlll Aid Society is
restricted to handling civil cases
only. in Albany County. The Com-
munity Lawyers Program.'on thc
othcr hand. employs the following
techniques:

I. one tittorncy handles cases from
beginning to end so he can maintain
a good attorney-client relationship;

2. casclouds are limited to
manageable numbers in order to
maintain high-quality service;

3.tlirough lhc Voluntccr Lawyers

vote against Rockcl‘c'llcr‘s confirma-
tiotl. in piirl because of his immense
\vciiltli. ’ I

plained tliiit Rockefeller is rich than

criminal defense services to im-
poverished clients; I

i.c. these lawyers are independent of .

the county government. and the
poor trust them more readily.

In addition to these needs. the
lawyers meet other community re-
quirements. which include legal ad-
vice to ininntcsofstatcand loclilcor-
rcctional facilities. legal services to
poor persons who are charged with
Federal immigration violations.

.Thc Prisoners‘ Rights Project is
for persons currently in Albany
County Jail. lt provides legal
assistance to them. This can be in the
form of legal tidvicc. help on an
appeal. orussistancc on n prisoner‘s
ﬂights-issue. In addition. this project
helps people getting out ofjail find
employment. housing or welfare
support. The Prisoners‘ Rights Pro-
jcct lobbies for criminal justice and
prisoners‘ rights. In short. l’risoncrs‘
Rights supports initiates its in-
dividinils.

Another program. the Youth and
llic Law Program. is it lcglll educa-
tioli program‘y for young people
between the ages of I] and I9. This
program teaches kids on the streets
what the law is all about. what their
rights are. how the system functions;
what its purpose is. etc. The informa-
tioil is disseminated on the street
level to various street academics.
youth—oriented guidance and Icar-
ning centers. possibly the Albany
Home for Children. and juvenile in-
stitutions.

To carry out this inlcnl. some paid
lccturcrsand some volunteers will

        
  

 
 
 
    
   
    
  

offer a course in the “Youth and the
Law“ Project. These courses include:

l. skits put on todramatizewhat a
victim does in case oftheviolation of
individual rights. consumer fraud.

'lundlord-tcnant hassles. political
pressure. hurrassment. alimony.
welfare.

'I'hesc episodes are followed by
discussions;

2. the explanation of legal terms:

3. the conducting of mock trials;

4. tllcasking ol‘qucstionsofyoung
people related to their own contact
with the law:

5. the setting up of panels and the
cncourtigcmciit of participation in
class lcgal projects;

6. the borrowing of techniques
used by ollicr slrcct lnw projects.
such as the one in Washington. D.C.

Through the “Youth and the Law“
Project. judgcs. policemen. and
lawyers can sitdown with a kill in the
Boys Club or in some other place
and discuss law. This exchange
provides education on both sides of
lhc fence. In addition to the
provisions above. field trips are con-
ducted to police. traffic. and family

~' cursioiisiirc also conducted

and trials. to parole hearings and
meetings of the Parole liourd.

houses. community orgiinimtions

the law school and its library. All
residents of the community are in-

Letters explaining the course have
been sent to other service groupsand
youth centers. Youth may make
suggestions concerning the
organization structure and focus.
presentation and content of the pro-
ject. and may get on the Boardiof
Directors. Community Legal Rights
people think that young people feel
comfortable in their work with the
law. some might want to help young
offenders on probation and parole.
They can identify with their peers in
similar situations.

Why is this organiwtion going to
tile plticcs whcrc the kids are to give
out this information? They feel that
in this way kids will be more rcccp-
live to the education. .

The Legal lnformatiori Service
distributes information to the com-
iniinity in regard to different
criminal justice issues. They answer
questions on tile telephone and in
person at thcirofficcs. All communi-
ty groups know about the Foundu- r
tion and publicize their telephone
number. As it result more people
downtown urc tiwnrc of the
organi/iition‘s existence than are
people uptown. As pul succinctly by
Guy Jones. “The people who need to
know know.“ It's illegal for the
organization to advertise formally.

(iuy Jones explained how he
became interested in the Community
Legal Rights Foundation. He had
worked with kids for several years
who had gotten in trouble with the
law. and it got into his blood. “The
poor get rammed right through the
criminal justice system." he said. He
cmphtlsllcd that the poor can't help
llicmsclvesutlicy nccd education in
order to do this. '

The Foundation is privately fund-
cd by donations. Two years ago. they
