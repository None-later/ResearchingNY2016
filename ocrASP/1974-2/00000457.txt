“~The rena‘wiiiﬁciear twelve, minu after ‘the polls closed in, New York: the.

, _- Republican'l’a‘rty was headed for the worst beating it had taken-since it assumed power
" sixteen yeais ago. All three television networks had predictedBrooklyn Congressman
' Hugh'Carey ahdState Senator Mary Ann Krupsak fro’m Cttnajoharie County as the
. ‘vict  n”. the Goi'ernor andLi'eutenanttGovernor races. As the results continued to
pourih-du'ring theeouse of the night, it was obvious that not‘only had the Republicans
' reliiiguished their'liol'd on the Govemor’s Mansion but that the Democrats had~cap~
wraith: State Assembly. a goal that had eluded them since the rise ‘of Nelson
' Rockefeller. I . I . ' ‘ ' . ‘
"The power base of the Assembly will be radiwlly—different when its members con-
{ vene'in «January. Brooklyn Assemblyman Stanley Steingut will probably be the new
Speaker. following the ousted Perry Duryea of Suffolk County. Duryca‘s .cozy
relationship with the Executive Branch has now ended. and it is doubtful whether
Stiengut will seek to establish a similar relationship with the new Governor.
’ Hugh Carey has assumed a responsibility that until now has only been in the fornt of
rhetoric. l'he Democrats have accepted a mandate‘of the people of New York on the
promise‘that they will “undo” the damage that the Republicans have done to New York
since Averill Harriman left office. Carey and the-Democrats can no longer claim the in-
itocence ofthe political “out” party, since as‘the majority party in the Assembly. they
must accept responsibility for directing the policies of.New York.
,Carey's victory is stunning. It has proven that Wilson‘s desperate campaign adver-

tising bliti which did everything but slander his Democratic opponent was unaccep-

 

table to the voter. Wilson accused Carey of bold-faced lies. had men ofquestionahle in- ,

telligcnce espouse inhuman crime-control solutions and harped on Krupsak‘s synt-
pathy toward the mill-treated criminal. It all failed. Wilson has disgraced his party as
well as the office he so tenuously held for ten months.

As students. we have voted out a possible doublingof state university tuitions. and
prolonged the life of the mandatory Student tax. Unfortunately. yesterday‘s election is
U an CSP‘CQllliiykhgiigW one for all New yomgséand for all Americans. Estimates have

‘ placed ivoter‘t'timout ntttiodliiiidght somethtin .close to 55 million. less than 38%oftlte
nation‘s registered voters. A Democratic mandate coming from such an apathetic elec-
torate weakens theicffort before it has begun.

Across the nation. Democrats pickedup a preponderant majority in the House of
Representatives. 'l'hcy gained close to fifty seats. approaching the number required to
establish a theoretically‘veto-proof Congress. Senate seats were added in proportional
numbers and as a result. they should have the numbers necessary to begin the job they
said they could do for this nation. The onus for action is on them. The Republicans can
now claim powerlessness. If the Democrats fail in their attempt. we have only to
remember President Ford‘s unusually perceptive comment to the effect that those who

lose today come back to win some other day. Nothing could be worse for the future of

tltis state and for the nation than for the Republicans to re-emerge if the Democrats
falter and fail to deliver.

The Republiain have been repulsed everywhere they reared their heads. The cir-
cumstances have never been more propitious for innovative. progressive legislation to

emerge from Albany. Washington. and the other state capitals. The problems that face
society in the two years before the Presidential elections can be conquered only by an
aggressive legislatures.

The mandate is clear.

In the final analysis it will be up to the Democratic party to prove itselfworthy of the
voters trust as well as to show itself equal to the great challenges it will meet in dealing
with a wide range of complex problems and issues. If the Democrats succeed in main-
taining the confidence of the electorate. and if they can mend at last their interior fac-
tionalization. we will see newly reborn Democratic force emerging to take the lead on

the national front in I976. as well.

Eleven Years Since Diem

 

Friday. November 1 was the eleventh un-
niversary ofthe overthrow of President Diem
of South Vietnam. That assassination brought
forth a new era in American and world
history. What was the outcome of the events
that ensued during that time‘.’ Sadly. practical-
ly all the results have been harmful, if not dis-
iistcrous. to our country and to the principles
of democracy we citeriéii.

Diem had begun to dely certain commands
he received from the United States govern-
ittent and the Pentagon. He had fallen out of
our country's good graces because of his dis-
obedience. and the Us. no longer felt that his
continuance in office was a necessity. The
government was far front displeased when he
was killed.

The coup ushered in our policy ot'esctiltition
which trickled into prominence through l964
and ﬂooded into national priority status in
I965. It was bewuse of this escalation that
President Johnson executed the policy that
any sane economist would tell him could lead
only to disaster; he allowed Americans to con~
surne all the “butter” they wished. while the
military received all the “guns” it deemed
necessary to wage and win the war. Only our
nation could perform this statistical miracle
lor any length oflirrie. But the long-range side
ellects are still being felt. ‘

Of course. another painful result has been
the division the war created in the nation. The
merits of the war itself were it major issue of
the sixties that still lingers today. But there has
been no calming ot'the bitter controversy aur~
rounding the P.0.W. and draft resister
problems. The latter has been recently “resolv-
ed" to almost no one's total utilfacthn.

And what war the effect of the war of the
