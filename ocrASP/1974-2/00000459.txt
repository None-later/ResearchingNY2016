Thursday night they're all packed;
Monday you can get a table anywhere.
".‘his one doesn't have Bud on tap;
drinks at that one are cheap—and
lousy. The Albany bars: From uptown
to downtown and Central to Madison
they reign supreme in the nighttime
hours. The llashing ol a neon sign
draws you to one; the shingle outside

0 M the door invites you into another.

The bouncer at The Silo is a sell-
proclaimed expert on the Albany
drinking scene, having been, belore
his present job, a bartender at W.T.'s
and a performer at The Sally DogThe
last, on Ontario Street just oll Madison
Avenue. he deemed "raunchy" owrng
to a recent change in management.
The new owners were "really into rac-
ing cars" and had opened the place to
18—year olds, which apparently
resulted in a large local (i.e. non»
SUNYA) lollowing. The Silo doorman,

a State student, said his band had .

played at the Salty Dog, until "a guy
decrded one night to drop his pants." I
suppose that's the tolerable limit to
raunchiness. Other reports deem
the Dog “hot, sweaty, loud, always
crowded, and servrng lousy drinks."
But it's guaranteed that you'll meet
someone you know there, there's
entertainment—and a packed dan-
cing ﬂoor—every night, and on
Wednesday there’s no cover charge.
Towards the back and downstairs at
the Ramada Inn on Western Avenue is
The Silo, named lor the silo that's out-
side and towards the lront ol the motel.
it's basically a place to go with lriends.
Couples come alone or with other
couples, groups at lemales, males,
lernales and males, jocks, lraternitiea,
sororities—a very heterogeneous mix-
ture ol (largely) SUNYA students. Not

businessmen have been filtering in
trom the upstairs restaurant and motel.
The bartenders (students and
protessionals) are very nice, there's a
pong machine near the entrance. and
the wooden lumiture and simple
decorations—horoscope plaques on
the walls, muted orange and white
lights in the ceiling—make tor a very
comtortable place to spend a lew
hours. A pitcher ol beer costs $2.25.
Thursday through Saturday The Silo
stays open until 2. During the week
music is supplied by a juke box; on
Saturday evening a lolk duo, Mikeand
Gloria, entertain.

Oh well, it's probably rust a dirty old

Suller's Mill and Mining Co, down
Western Avenue just a bit lrom The
bile, opened up last year. It began as
strictly a student bar, but lately more
and more "townies" have been show-
ing up. By 10:30 on Thursday night
there isn't a seat to be lound, either at

Pitchers here are $2.25,and come with
lrosted mugs, which makes the beer
much lrothier and colder. Sutter's
seems a bit smoker than some other
spots; this is because ol the grill at the
end ol the bar. The lood here is great:
cliarbroiled burgers, steamers, and
huge plates ol trench tries (they're only
35¢) are just a lew ol the attractions on

."Sulter's Bill ol Fare." Many

All the way downtown, at 234
Washington Avenue, is the Outside
lnn, which just recently has been
promoting itsett on the SUNYA cam-
pus.'lts one room appeared one Fri-
day evening to be titled and only halt
tilled at that, with a rather young and
noisy local crowd. The juke box was
loud, the bartender was rushed, the
drinks were bitter and the beers no
bargain. That was just one visit, but I
don't know what odds I'd take on its all-
around perlormance.

A little out ol the way, on Delaware
and Holland Streets, is the Elbow
Room. This is supposedly the place to
go it you want to leave the world ol
SUNYA and meet students lrom
Albany Med and Albany Law. Prices
are reasonable and it also leatures cold
cuts and a tree salad bar, with cole
slaw, macaroni and potato salads and
such. Legislature members and doc-
tors go there olten tor lunch, but it is
open to the general public, and there's
a Hathskeller downstairs.

ll anyone wants variety, there's
Sludley’s Pub on Madison Avenue, a
ba r that caters to local males—students
are permitted, but usually not too
welcome. And Pouli's, on Central
Avenue and Quail Street is interesting,
it you're interested in watching old
men sit around and play hand
shuttleboard. Women: Don't go alone!
(Not that you'd want to).

For couples and people who have
cars (and nice clothes) the place to go
is Woll ltoad iii Colonic, where (juitea
lew restaurants have very nice bars,
and there are a nuriiberol spots which

restaurant by day and .
The Hermit is about as close _
tan's East Side as you'll getth‘is tar up
the Thruway. The oval-shaped bar in
the center at the room is usually pack-
ed; around the circumterence (but a
sale distance away from the general
masses) are wall-side tables tor those
whose legs are weary; not from dan-
cing since it's usually so crowded
there's barely room to stand, let alone
move. The sawdust on the lloor con-
trasts slightly with the Titiany lamps,
stained glass and lloral curtains, but it
stops the bus boys (they're the ones in
the white jeans) lrorn slipping as they
run trom table to table, making sure, I
suspect, that no one's‘ stealing the
glasses. The drinks are decent and the
prices reasonable: it's a good place to
meet people, and the main attraction is
the knowledge that you've really
gotten away lrom the campus.

One ol the lirst thingsthat you notice
when you enter the bar at The Barn-
srder (in Colonie Center) is all the saw-
dust on the ltoor. Well, it's not sawdust;
it's peanut shells. The Barnsider gives
peanuts and cheese and crackers to its
drinking patrons. and that's just one
slight aspect of The Barnsider's enor-
mous appeal. Smaller than most
places, it's everything lrom a pre-meal
cocktail lounge to a line steak and
sea lood restaurant. But it'san excellent
place to go tor a really nice drinking
evening. For just a nickel or so more a
drink-in some cases not even that
much—you get a quiet table with a
candle in a jar in a music-less room
where you can talk without being dis-
turbed by pushy waitresses, and the
best mixed drinks around (made with
good graded liquor). Since it's part of a
restaurant, people walk in and out ot
the lounge as part ot their meal, but

evening. The only drawback, o sit

to The Bamsidér is that it has to end: _

early; last call is 12:15, on Saturday): 1’

12:45. It's closed on Siinday.
The list of Albany 'drinkeries is"
almost endless. Harold's Ollice, yet
another bar on Well Road, is popular,
the Varsity Inn, uptown right oil of
Washington Avenue promises drink-,
ing and dancing nearly all night long,
Adam's Apple on Central Avenue, a
new discothegue, The Shamrock
downtown on‘Elk Street, sworn to be
genuinely Irish. The sizes at drinks,
their tastes, the ditterent beers ottered,
all these vary lrom bar to bar. Most
places have a Happy Hour, usually on
Thursday sometime between 7 and 10,
when beer and certain drinks are halt-
priced. The most notable generality
that could be made aboutall the places
is that at every bar 1 saw more men
than women. I suppose that could be
interpreted as having deep
sociological ramilications, but I'm no
sociologist. All I know is that by the
time my research was nearly overt
was able to tie the stem at the
rnaraschino cherry in a knot with my
tongue. The theory behind that has yet
to be delinitively and extensively
proven, but that's next week’s survey.
