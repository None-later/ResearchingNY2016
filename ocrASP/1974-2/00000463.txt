ccivably, dangerous decision. They
were leaving a successful band that
could boast of live US tours and as
many hit albums. Itut they felt that
Savoy‘s music was becoming predie- .
table. Alterimuch deliberation. they
notified the remaining members of
their decision to leave. It wasa hard
loss for Savoy Brown. but they tried
to weather it and. in spite of
countless personnel changes they a re
