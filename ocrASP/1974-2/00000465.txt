Third Quarter Magic .

The third quarter explosion. 'I'hat‘s been the name of the game for the
Albany football team's offense all season. It‘s been their best quartcrall year.
‘I'wo weeks ago it was 2| points in the third quarter against Brockport and
last Saturday the Danes put an amazing 29 points on the board in their
favorite quarter against a shocked Curry squad. Both performances crime
altcr lackluster first halves by the Danes.

Witlt Albany‘sspecial third quarter heroics. one would imagine that Coach
Ford's halftime tqu must really be something else. But this is rtot the case
Ford‘s speeches have been far from the "win one for the flipper“ variety.

"I didn‘t say much at halftime." said l-‘ord about the Curry game. “I
thought wc played well ill thefirstltalf. Wcjustcouldn‘t get altoldol’thc foot-
ball. I told the team not to worry. and relax; things will workthcntsclvesotu
Ford was right. as the Danes completely cxploitedCurry in thcsccond hall.

\\ ishbonc 'I akcs 'l'ime

Instead. the reason for Albany‘s l‘ine third quarter performances is the
Dttnc‘s wishbone offense. The wishbone is a very contplcx offense which
develops slowly. Basically. it allows quarterback .lolm’ llcrtuzri to exercise
several options. while keeping the defense confused.

The key to the offense is Bernini’s ability to read the opposition‘s defense.
Thus. the Iirst half of each game becomes something of art cx pcrirnenl. with
Bci‘lll/ll prohingthe opposition‘s defense for weaknesses. l‘hc Danes do rtot
rcttlly develop an offensive gnmc plan until the third quarter. with the
resulting offensive explosions.

In the llrockport game. Dane fullback 'lommy Delllois run wild. Curry
scoutsrtt that game brought back a simple rcport:stop Delilois and you stop
Albany‘s ollensc. Defensivcly. Curry keyed on Delilois. rrtovittg an outside
linchaclqcr inside. and leaving that sldt.‘ relatively open. I)clllois was stopped
tip the middle. gaining only 37 yards. for below his average rushing perfor-
mance ol l2lf yards a game. With the middle jammed. Ilcrtuni took advan—
tage ol the wishbone. and exercised his other options.

I\ itii- Opt-n 'I'erritory

Instead ol gotttg up the middle. llcrlttZ/i tvcnt wide to the open territory. ||
iltcdclcndcrs on the side went Ior .lolm. tltc quarterback would pitch tltchall
to one of his hallbacks. Iltc halfback would have a blocker irt lront ol him to
block against one dclcndcr.llus lltlppcttcd repeatedly in tltctltird quarter
against Curry. as hotlt Orin Griffin and (ilcnn Sowalskie were sprung for

II the dctcnsc fails to pick up Ilcrluui. .loltn just continues wide. Curry

Often the rlelcnding team will try to move another rnatt ittto this area;
usually by sneakinga man up front the secondary to protect against the run.
It llcrtu/xi reads lltis. llt: will usually call the play action pass to Bob llaxtcr.
who I.\ tell uncotcrcd as the result of the movement of utcrt. This play has

by Virtin Redo

I was running downtown on
Washington Avenue when I saw her
come at me. ltwasa few weeksago. I
was dressed in shorts. sleeveless tee-
shirt. sweatsoclts. and Adidas. I
always am. when I run; and I run a
lot. All I do. some days. is run.

She was huddled against the brick

wall of Freihofer‘s bakery. just'

before Quail Street. Quail Street is
where i turn in. go over to Western
Avenue. and proceed to run back up-
town to the SUNYA gym. where my
running begins.

This day. l was delayed. by her.
She had black gums. and uniquely
spaced whitd teeth. She was wearing
a long dark dress—down to her
ankles-and a brown netted shawl:
and she stepped out now in front of
me. .

It had been a nice run up till now.
True. I had been inhaling exhaust
fumes for the past three miles. Also
true. i probably had rearranged-
marty of the bones in my legs by run-
ning on that abstract mess of slate
tltcy call a sidewalk on Washington
Avenue.

Ycl thcdtty had bcen warm. trnd a

few friends had waved to me for a
change. as they drove by in their
cars. My stomach was ttot giving me
gastric cramps as is its~wont. and I
had missed all the traffic lightsw
making my run harmonious with the
smooth tlow of nature.
But then this'witch stoppigd me.
He on thcc.“'she said with long
pointy fingers extended. as lskiddcd
to a stop. “Fic on tltcc for wearing
such sinful attire. If I see thee again
this way. I shall put the curse ol'thc
serpent upon thee!“

Now no ortc believes this. I am
sure. None of you have seen her do
the serpent routine. Maybe she has
put the curse of the bread mold on
your Canadian Oat as you left the
bakery thrift shop? But nozonly the
runncr is singled out for scorn.

Well. it is trtrc all the samc.and it
had a traumatic effect on me. Sure. it
was easy to say. “oh (ntodct'n
equivalent of ‘iic thcc‘). ya old
witchl.“ and then run away with an
eye out tor snakes. llut inside I was
thinking. “Why. why do I run?"

Which is wlty I write this. Yottsec.
every year. at least lch people come
up to me: "How can yort get yourself

once asked are probably now cad.

Ult does not matter how‘many
interested anyway. I don‘t have an
answer. Which is i‘cheap way to‘end
an article. but. as you see. you are
still only in the middle. The reason is
that I first want you to know that I
have tried to think this out.

To start. runners are romantics of
a sort. They reach for the ideal
realms. of friendship. nature.
physical perfection. and the satisfac-
tion of their own egos. l have tried
thcni all. however. and the result is
always just so much sh— but let me
illustrate.

I ran in a road race in a small Con-
necticut town a few summers ago.
There was a country fair going on.
and in this rural setting. we runners
felt irrevocably linked with the past.
nature. and ourselves.

There was even a horse drawn
parade before the race began. Unlor-
tunatcly. horses are pigs when it
comes to certain social mores; and

 

hole ii

Vinny lode.

unbeknownst to us. a motorized
street sweeper had spread the
pa radc‘s remainsout in a gentle sheet
over miles of the course.

It was 95 degrees in the shade. We
rrtn ill the sun. My first reaction.
after the race had taken us into this
aromatic area. was to turn angrily to
the runner beside my and say. “hey
slob. cut it out. huh?“

But he was saying it to me; and
everyone else was saying it to each
other. We now all realized this was
more than a momentary slip-up of
humanity. And so we hated rtaturc
thttt day. lltttcd each other, Some
were cursing. others were pushing.
ntuny were scert sliding in anger.and
a few simply fainted from it all.

I next felt that if competitors
could rtot fch forcuch otltcr in sucha
world. rttaybc learn members still
could. After all. they do in other
sports. Maybe I ran “for the team".

Other sports box their learns in.
however. between the boundaries of
their playing areas. It is their natttrc
to “play together“. Runners seek
freedom; they mustjnurncy outward
in order to find mutual peace. This
leads to problems.

Like two years ago. It was a week
before otrr biggest meet. the

stepping in a hole. I went to the
nationals in a cast. ‘

“Forget the team!" I thought. "A
runncr‘s love for his sport centered in’
himself." I would gain fame. get my
picture in the papers; become the
idol of millions of women.

I won my first race here at Albany.
This paper headlined that event:
“Rcda Leads State to Win."(ircat. I
thought. There was even a picture.

But it was not a picture of me. It
was an old untitled piii't'tire of some
ntthcr unattractive Albany runner
finishing a race. He was almost bald.
He was gasping in pain. He had spit
all over his glasses. '

A friend of mine told me he saw
two girls looking at the article on the
State Quad dinner line. One said.
“gee. this Vinny Reda is a star

"Yeah." said thcother.“butjust look

I ran the finest nice of my life this
year at Colgate. I led by too yards. I
began to think that this was the
masterpiece I had longed for. I miss-
ed a turn. went offthe course. When
I rcturnedl was in fourth place.

Something keeps me going even
now. Possibly it is the memory ot‘an
incident that occurred as I ran
through the streetsof my hometown.
on n winter‘s day live years ago.

I was in a bad mood. It was 5
degrees and the streets were clumps
of ice. left from a bad plowing job. I
had turned my ankle twice.

Added to this. I was running
without an athletic supporter. My
mother was washing them. I now
realired that in the winter. this piece
of cloth served tltc dual purpose of
providing both support and terribly
essential wannth. l was receiving
neither.

I saw a little girl standing on the
srtow Ctl\'cl‘cd lawn. bundled up irt
winter coats arid boots. She lliitl'li
very round four year old face and
stumpy little legs.

She was two and hull’fcct tttlland
very fat. Yet at that age we think of
them as rosy checked and chubby.
'l'ltc rounder the better. and she was.
In a few years. when the bloom of
childhood faded. we would all just
call her fat.

I could see that she was about to
speak. What would be the annoyittg
comment this time. I thought. You
have hairy legs. Where are your
clothes‘.’ Aren‘t you freezing your
rocks off dummy?

This time I would answer back. I
would not let any brat who was
headed for a corona ry at Ill tell me I
was stupid for exercising. ller big
eyes lit up. ‘Ah-hah! Now she
speaks." I thought. “And then. lwill
curse her out."

Running is gooood for you." she
said...l sunk to my knees. I was

r crying~or maybe laughing. .

I turned to see her waddling brick
into her house. "Come back. my lit-
