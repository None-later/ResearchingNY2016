Diffuse. ‘

by Nln'ey coolt V " ,L ~
Frederic Storaska,’ the leading authority on rape.

spoke last Monday night. November 4, to an enthusiastic ' '

audience of about 800 men and women. His humorous
style both entertained and taught those present.

. Ten years ago, Storaska said he broke up a gang of
teenagers attempting to brutally rupe an eleven year old
girl. After this incident. he sought 'hard information of
rape. Finding that there was practically none, he decided
to devote himself to researching rape and trying to solve
the problem. ‘ ,

When he felt ready to give lectures. Storasktiwtis not”
given it chance to speak because of the "taboo nature of
rape." His first lecture in~ I964 was limited to ﬁfteen
minutes at a private women's college. Later. by injecting ,
humor, many doors began to open for hitii.

Preventing Rape

Stornska discussed the common methods of “preven-

“ procediiig to break down their value and
effectiveness. The key point fora victim to remember i;
to diffuse the riipist‘s violence u never attack his ego

‘ structure. said the expert. lfthc woman treats the rapist

as it compassionate human being, she may communicate
and possibly rationalize with him.

"Never do anything that, it'll doesn't work, willdo you
harm.“ Storuskti repeatedly told his audience. Scream-
ing. for example, works only 50% of the timcjl‘hc other
Stl‘Xi’i who tittempt it do not survive, Storusknquippcd.

Kicking is (“101th methodthitt Storziskn says usually

up'fo‘r on , cond or two. , "

After all his years of research. Storaska explained that
there are only No methods that will never fail. The first
is that if the assailant has his hands around the victim‘s
neck. she is to put her hands to his face as ifto caress him.
Then. she is to move her thumbs up and put out hiseycs.
It is “as easy its putting your lingers in preserves." If she
decides that she cannot carry through with it, he willnot
suspect her of trying anything.

The second assured method is to find the man‘s Y

testicles. Place the hands upon them as if to fondle, then
smash them. It will put him in shock and may even kill

Siortiskti related. stories ofhow girls. by usingtlteir im-
agination, saved themselves from rape. For example. it
than and a woman went out on a date. The male decided
to get very aggressive. and wouldn't accept no for tln
answer. the women. being quick wilted. urintited all
over him. Another vomited on her boyfriend in orderto
iiitikc hini stop. One girl pretended to throw till epileptic
lit lllltl scared licr would-be attacker away.

'l'lirougliout the course of the evening Stortiska
repeated the phrase “nothingjustitics rape.“ He received
a great round of applause when be suited that what is int-
ptll‘llllll about it woman "is hermind. not her body:“ that
women ttl‘L‘ complex. intelligent human being! and
should be treated its such. Stornskn ended his lecture by
saying “leave in twos."

(ANS) A freshman at the Universi-

to organize one of the world‘s most
ignored minorities left-handed
people.

David McCall is calling on left-
!iiinded people everywhere to
publicize their predicaments by
writing backwards that is. from
right to left across the page instead of
Howell to right.

McCiill claims that left-hunded
people are forced curly iii life to write
in the wrong direction because the
world. he siiys.discriinintitus in favor
of right-hunders. He says that under
the existing system taught in grade
schools. lefties iirc coerced into
writing the wrong way. and end up
usually with finger cramps and
eullnuses on the tips of lingers.

McCtill insists it‘s much easier to
ptill. rather than push a pen orpcncil
across it piece of ptipcr and that.
therefore. lefties should write from
right to left.

llis motto is "Rewop Ytl'el" - -
which is. of course, "Lefty l’owcr."
