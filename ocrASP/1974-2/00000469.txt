Mandatory Reiu nd -

N Y PIRG is receiving some money from S UNYA this year. but its funding in future
years is not secure. The suit by some Pl RG members. who acted on behalfof the5.000
students signing the petition supporting the voluntary funding of PIRG. against Presi-
dent Benezet and Chancellor Boyer was thrown out of court. Citing Benezet and Boyer

as being unresponsive to the large number of students (getting 5.000 students to sign W

anything is akin to getting all the members of the House of Representatives. the U.S.‘
Senate and Alcoholics Anonymous to simultaneoust shout yes to anything). the suit
sought speciﬁcally to overrule Boyer‘s “arbitrary and capricious" decision not to allow
a “mandatory refundable line“ on the tuition bill. -

As it ’tums out. this decision by Boyer and Benezet was upheld by the court.
However. the decision makes little difference for this year. Student Associatioh in-
directly is helping fund NYPIRG through SUNYA PIRG. who has rmde a “contract
for-services“ with NY PIRG. This means the SUNYA group pays for the state PIRG‘s

services- lawyers. printing. and information. Sound technical and complex? PIRG mi

members are the ﬁrst to admit that it is.)
We would. therefore. urge and alternate way of funding NYPI R0. The mandatory

refundable line would be the most practical. but failing that. perhaps some other form
of contract with NYPIRG may be arranged. such as a voluntary contribution. for ex-

ample.

Approximately 90 percent of these crashes
could be prevented by an inexpensive (about
SI l.000 per plane to purchase and install)safe~
iy devise which would save scores of lives and
millions ol dollars. '

Itut the I‘edcrnl Aviation Administration
has delayed ordering use of this device for
years. and will not require airlines to install it
until late I976. (In a phrase worthy ochorgc
Urwcll's “dbuhlespeak.” the F.A.‘A. calls such
crashes “inadvertent contacts with the
ground.")

The facts are fully documented in hearings
conducted last month by the Investigations
Subcommittee ol'thc ilouscCommittee on In-
terstate and Foreign Commerce.

Witnesses before this subcommittee told
what one staff member termed “an incredible
tale of bureaucratic inertia.“ This may be a
generous understatement. when We consider
the lives that have been lost.

John H.‘ Reed. Chairman of the National
'l‘runsportuiion Safety Board. reported that he
has been trying since I969 to get something
done about the matter.

Iteed said he has urged the If.A.A. to re-
quire that all airplanes be equipped with
Ground Proximity Warning Dcvic .
Whenever it. plane strays’too close to the
ground. or descends too rapidly. the device
automatically shouts “pull up. pull up." and

talshes a red "Terrain" sign in the pilot‘s face.
It Works on much the samcprinciple as the
scat-belthuxzcr. Aslong as your seat belt is
fastened (or the pilot llies the plane safely).
you hardly are aware that the warning device

. tEthlb'.

llut why would an experienced pilot need
such a device? Shocking as it may seem. planes
sometimes fly into the ground simply because
crew members are distracted or even careless.

For example. the last words recorded in the
cockpit just before an Eastern Airlincsjumbo
jet crushed'last year were those of the pilot:
"We're still at 2.000 (feet) aren't we‘!“

l'rodded by the Investigations Subcom‘
mince. the F.A.A. finally has begun to act.
Last mon h it issued instructions which will
should It) new hitches dcvclop-~ guarantee
full use of the new safety device by late 1970.

As for the late I976 date. it now seems to be
the earliest possible. Neither Congress nor the
Safety Board feels a need to challenge the
current l’.A.A. assertion that any earlier
deadline would be physically impossible to
meet.

This story would be easy to explainwcrcit a
Cu. of official corruption or industry greed.
but it appears that maximum safety simply
became lost in the bureaucratic bullet for
which government is so famous.

In the meantime. if the laws of statistical
probability prevail. we can soon expect a ma-
jor air disaster which speedier action could
have prevented.

by Paul Pﬁgalii . r -. ’ ' ,

Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead. will be
playing so: an. weekend ~ with Méns:
Saunders and friends. Garcia is the most well-
known member of the Dead. with whose
music many people are familiar. Any Deadf
freak who reads this article will probably say. .
“So. what‘s new?“ but this short history‘is for
the uninformed. - .

The Dead’are not just a band. they are a
family which has evolved and grown since the
early sixties. Garcia and Ron (Pigpenl‘ ‘
McKeman were playing in a band called the
Zodiaee. In I964 Bob Weir joined them and
they formed Mother MeCree's Uptown Jug
Champions. With Garcia on lead guitar. Weir
on rhythm . Pigpen on organ and Bill Kreutz-
man playing drums. they asked a friend with
perfect pitch. a trumpeter named Phil Lesh. to
play bass. He learned it in two weeks.

As I965 rolled around the band. now the
Warlocks. had met Ken Kesey in I’an Alto. a
small California town. Kesey and Robert
Hunter. who would become the Dead‘s lyricist
in I969. were working as test subjectri for the
State Hospital. The experiments sought to

supplied the music for these Acid test"! and got
really high themselves; :'~‘The Grateful Dead.“
says Garcia. “isn't for cranking out rock and
roll...it‘s for-getting high.” .

As the hippie movement grew. so did the
seriousness with which the Dead took their
music. After hearing there was another band
called the Warlocks. Garcia picked up a die-
tionary: and found the words grateful and
dead together. lt‘sa musicological term from

Scottish and Irish folk ballads that have to do ‘

with visitations of the dead to clear the soiled
honor of a dead man.

Following a move to Haight Ashbury the
Dead became known as "the people‘s band.“
They played free concerts and dances.'l'hey
played in the Human lie-In at Golden Gate

. Park. Some of the bands they played with

were Jefferson Airplane. Big Brother'and the
Holding Company and Quicksilver
Messenger Service. ' \ g c "
Various personnel changes occurred as their
music also underwent 'a transformation. In
I967 Mickey Hart joined‘the band as the se-
cond drummer. In the three years that he was
with the band the Dead's music was really
spacey yet increasineg cohesive. Torn_Con-
stanten joined themfor theinecond album in
I969 and stayed till I970. Robert Hunter in-
troduced John Damon and Dave Nelson to
Garcia and they formed New Riders of the

Purple Sage after Garcia learned to play pedal ,
steel guitar they toured with the Dead in I970. ~

The Riders‘ country-western style. plus the in-
ﬂuence of David Crosby and Graham Nash.
led to Workingman's Dead. Crosby and Nash
made the Dead realize that they were neglec-
ting their vocals and harmonies. Since then
their albums have been, more mellow and laid
back. In l97l Keith Godshaux and his wife
Donna joined the band. Keith isa super piano
player. Shortly after. this Pigpen died 'of
cirrhosis of the liver.

The music is more diverse now. Rock and

things beginning to fall apart from no sleep

and work on the newspaper down in new york
"on the elections staying up to seven in the mor-

ning things like that are strange but jcrry gar-
ciu here this weekend with merl saunders they
play different music from the dead its more
funky and bluesy and they do dylan and i'm
looking forward to it but itsa bad sign because
it means the dead are on their way to breaking
up that’s what the l'f/Itlgt' mire said last week
but its been so long and the dead have meant
so much it‘s going to hurt a lot.

the first record i ever bought was a dead
album “workingman's dead“ and it is still one
of my favorites uncle john‘s hand and black
peter are on it they did both of them this
summer at rooscvelt stadium i never expected
them to do either one and they did them one
after the other that was one of the best
moments ever at a dead concert even if there
were a million people all standing for four and
a half hours tired hot and high and back after
they all stood there in the rain and cold

no more concerts ever said the voice but
they‘re all so much into music they have the
world‘s best rock sound system thousands of
pounds and dollars but its the best and they
are the best no question really the other bands
play music the dead are a celebration they say
there is nothing like a grateful dead concert
and they‘re right who else always plays four
five hours and sends you through space time
your own head and all the other places you‘ve
always wanted to go.

the recordjust went off it was the first side of

the skull and roses live album now the slow v

morning dew.
the dead are special they really are because
you see they're more than just a rock and roll
group they’ve been different from their begin-
ning. they always played l‘rcc concerts in those
long lost sun l'rttncisco love peace acid days
and ‘ they built a family around them.
everybody that worked with them became part
of the family. they‘ve had their hassles too like
when phil lesh's father milked themfor one
hundred thousand dollars but they‘re not rich.
their overhead is gigantic and maybe that's
why they‘re splitting up its just gotten too big
to be fun anymore they can‘t play small places
or take it easy and that‘s why it's sad for us
because they are the last there was always
some hope even in the darkest of the nixon
days that we might make a big change and live
happily ever after but its dying now their
american beauty is wilting and i'm holding it
by the stern and there's a thorn sticking in my
palm and i'm really upset when pig pendied i
" think it was a signal to them that things were

 

_ roll. country. traditional and some old  ‘

material can be found on any of their lucid!-
forts. Recently. the individual members have
taken to doing solo albums. Garcia has put out «

two. Weir one and Lech is working on an  .-

album of eomputerizod music.

Garcia also plays on other people's album.
He has appeared on about40to date. About- >
year and a half ttgo he began touring with

Merle Saunders who had once played with -

Dead in concert. Saunders is an excelldltt
organ player who plays a funky brand of
:music. - . .

This may be a portent of things to colt.
Even though Garcia has toured with the Dead
since he started to tour with Saunders the
Dead have had problems. Their new indepen-
dent record company creates ﬁnancial worries
along with their incredible sound system and
family of about l00 people.

These difﬁculties may not culminate in the
break-up of the Dead but it has helped the
different members of the Dead to produce
some fine music outside the framework of the
band.

dead reach for
the dark; star

going wrong the karma was still there but
there wasjust too much to fight they couldn't
put up the struggle pig pen couldn‘t they took
him in I973 with a bottle in his hand and the
next week the dead played at the hated nassau
colliseum and the people waited all day out-
side to get in and they passed out on line it was
so squashed and they busted a lot of people
and after that the dead said they‘d never play
there again.

 

the dead talk of love and life in their songs
and they talk of dark star that‘s out there in
cvcryone‘s night spinning ﬂoating and waiting
for us to get there. hob weir sings of his sugar
magnolia and everyone wants a sugar
magnolia because you can see her because
“she‘s got everything delightful. she‘s got
everything I need“ and garcia sings about
truckin and "what a long strange trip its been“
and lush sings about his box of rain “i don't
know who put it there believe if you need it or
leave it if you dare“ and pig pen sang “gotta
find a woman be good to me won't hide my li-
quor try to serve me tea“ and bill thedrummer
krcutrman never sings he just hangs on his
d ruins and keith and donna godchaux are new
and they fit in somehow. they just fit in.
but jerry is playing with merl slander: and
they‘re really good but that's all they are the
music and thedead are so much more than just
the music so much more and they can't take
that away from us no they can't take that away
from us the dead are ours forever.
