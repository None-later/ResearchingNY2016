below the earth.  g ‘
,So he had to resort to a rare: he
ca "“ed an unusually beadtiful'fliiwer
' to 's‘pring‘up’ f rain the ground at quite
“a distance fm‘nitthe spot where
Persephone and, her. friends were
amusing themselves. Of course
Persephone noticed it at once and.
being more venturesome than her
companions. left them to add this
choice bloom to her bouquet. But
as sozn as she touched the flower the
earth opened and the chariot of
Pluto with the god himself as
charioteer appeared.

Persephone was carried off and
the earth had closed over the chariot
before anyone was aware of what
had happened. Though Persephone
was terrified and wanted only to
return to her own home and her
mother. l’luto managed topersuade
her to eat six .pomegrunate seeds.
That gave him a permanent hold
over her.

Persephone‘s Mom

Persephone‘s mother was
Demeter. the goddess of grain and
vegetation. whom the Romans
called Ceres. You can easily
recognize her name in the English
word “cereai.“ Soon. of course.
Demeter missed her daughter and
began to look for her. During the
whole time that Demeter was
sorrowing. engaged in her long and
difﬁcult search. no grain grew upon
the earth. Eventually Demeter
found her daughter with l’luto
beneath the earth in the kingdom of
the dead.

Mother and daughter wanted to
return to the upper world together.
However. because Persephone had
eaten those six pomegranate seeds.
she was not entirely free to leave. A
compromise was worked out
whereby Persephone spends six
months above ground with her
mother. Demeter. and six months
below with her husband, l’luto.

promised eternal ,life to' their in-
itiates. This anew“ called the
Eleusinian Mysteries because the
rites belonged to the tiny village of

Eleusis. only a few miles from ~

Athens. v
The cult was very popular among
both Greeks and Romans;' even the
Roman orator Cicero wasaninitiate.

myth must have had a close connec-
tion with Eleusisnhe people ofSieily

specifically from the area of Hennu.
