Hugh Carey is' the new governor of New

York Stateand the outlook for better care of 

our environment ridesin on his coat-tails.
Granted. political promises are often‘a dime-
a-dozen. but the overall environmental stance
of Mr. Carey throughout the campaign has
been noticeably pro-environment. .
In a pre~election news release Mr. Carey ex-
pressed his support for pro-environmental
legislation and reinforced hisplans to push for

‘ their immediate enactment. For the moment.

let us assume that Mr. Carey was sincere in his
statements of support. If we do. then we can
look forward to the push for comprehensive
land-use planning. environment impact
assessment of significant public and private
projects. increasing federal support for the
i:iuilding of sewage treatment plants. enforce-
ment of clean air standards. reinforcing of
state standards to ensure nuclear power, plant
safety. and desire to create a strong energy
conservation program. Mr. Wilson‘s opposi-
tion to many of these pro-environment con-
cepts makes Carey‘s election even more im-
portant.

As of the new year. we must begin to plan
and help mold legitimate and effective en-
vironmental legislation” Mr. Carey's words
reinforce this dedication to envrronmental
values:

“The environmental movement. in general.
has acted responsibly and consistently with
good public policy. It should not and will not
in my administration be a scapggoat for the

shortcomings of government in addressing the
problems of shortages in energy and materials
and the need forjobs."

Our job ‘now is to see that he keeps his
promises.

An Additional comnwm............... ‘

November l5-I7 is the date for the Ralph
Nader sponsored meeting “Critical Mass"
which intends to examine existing nuclear
power safety systems and their effectiveness.
The current energy crunch has predictably
transferred blame to those groups insisting on
environmentally sound construction and
operation of power plants. Other argue that
this is no time to delay projects. However.
F'I'FM believes it is also untimely and
irresponsible to continue to build plants when
their safe operation is still legitimately
questioned.

Those who argue against the development
and implementation ofa mandatory conserva-
tion program are among those pushing for un—
needed power generating facilities. The solu-
tion is to develop a national energy policy
which insists on construction of new power
facilities onlywhen‘they have been proven safe
and only when they have been proven
necessary. Current information indicates that
neither of these considerations has been
shown to be true. Meetings such as the plann-
ed “Critical Mass“ session in Washington are
needed to put the environment-energy
problem into better focus.
