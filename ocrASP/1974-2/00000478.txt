Youth fares are still being sold in

Europe should think about going
while the cost is still low. because-
thcre is talk of doing away with the
Canadian Youth fares. If this

from the present 5283 to something
over $600 «quite an increase.

The only sure way to beata ban on
Youth fares is to buy one now and
use the first part of the ticket as soon
as you can. Then the return portion
is good forone year at the Youth fare
price. Youth fare tickets are also
refundable at any time.

Lockhart said. “We want to see the
FSA work.” he added.

Potsdam College Bresident
Thomas Barrington contends that
the FSA Board is responsible to him,
and he was against the firing of
Johnson. But Lockhart asserts that
it is a “conﬂict of interest when an
administrator can determinehisown

allocates funds for “administrative
expenses" which Lockhart says in-
clude travel and entertainment costs.

crowded into the student union dur-
ing a rally called the day before by
student President Dave Fenton.
Fenton told students to stay where
they Were. “Maybe they (the faculty)
will tell Boyer when he gets here how
little space we have.“

The academic space at Canton is
built to accomodate 3000 students.
but the dorm and student activity

and all the men are tripled in the
dorms.

When he arrived. Boyer agreed to
meet with the students. “We pointed
out a lot that was wrong.“ Fenton
said. “but he wrotedown very little.“

Boyersaid that little could be done
about the dorm situation-rite could
not justify construction when there

at Potsdam. But he did agree to look
into larger refunds for students in
particularly cramped quarters on the

Barbershop Out, Record

by Brent Kigner

aimed at improving facilities in the Campus Center were introduced in (en

to the FSA lioard of Directors.

Where bill til was a proposal for the renovation of the Rtllltnkcllut.

bill. which passed by a 2-] margin. has been marked for veto by S.A. l’itn-
dent Curran. and the pool bill was passed only after its primary claust- n...
removed.

Opponents of the record co-op hill brought up the possibility that [In-n

these operations.

As with the previous bill. Council felt that the pool and pinball bill should
have been better researched before being introduced. Since the bill‘s m

recommendatitm on to FSA.

'l'hese bills appear to be the beginning ola response to President (inrmn‘s

Directors. the time for action on FSA may be at hand.

In reaction to the recent affair ol'the Alton Smith donations and the ( ialcla

would prevent a reoccurrancc of such mandatory or quasi-mandatory con-

” I hind the typical law ﬁrm title
“Rosenblum and Leventhal)? works
an energetic woman attorney Linda

Leventhal. “I love every minute of ‘

my work with-students." she says,
her voice resounding with
enthusiasm on a rainy, Monday
morning. She settles back in abrown
leather chair in her small ofﬁce. a
toy-like, humorous statuette with
the caption “Sue the Bastard"sitting
atop her desk.

“We're a ﬁrm of lawyers ranging
in ages from 28-36.” Leventhal, an

_ Albany Law School graduate. says

of herself and her four male
colleagues who are retained by the
Student Association to provide free
legal advice to university students.
“We're young enough to relate to the-
studcnts and really understand their
problems."

The S.A. lawyers offer free office
or telephone consultation for
students from 8 am. to 6 pm. week-
ly. Sanford Rosenblum holds office

Avenue daily. Besides advrsing
students. the lawyers have their own
private practices.
Landlord Complaints
The most common student com-
plaint Leventhal receives is against

landlords. “When a student calls, the
ﬁrst thing l'llask him is, ‘Who‘syour
landlord?‘ I've come to know the
good ones and the bad ones." she
says. Most students call Leventhal
for advice on breaking lenses and

Because of the large  o |
student complaints. Leventhal  ,‘

not represent uan in court. "It
would be impractical todefend every
student.“ she says. “In cases where
one student co mplnins about
another. how does one defend both
students in court?" she questions. “I

advise a student on how to initiate a '

legal action or defend himself
against one.“ Leventhal also
arranges bail for any student who
has been arrested.

“Students win the most cases in
small claims courts." Leventhal con-
tinues. her eyes wide with interest

from behind gray tinted glasses. “lfa .

jacket. 1‘" advise him to file his own
suit and prepare a defense. The
process is simple in small claims‘
court because no rules of evidence
exist. It's satisfying for the student to
see justice at work." '

Each student lawyer is both a
general practitioner and a specialist.
“We‘re all uniquely qualified." she
quips. While Rosenblum deals with

expression becoming serious. “I've
had many cases where all it took was
a little bit of talking between the bus-
band and the wife to end'thc divorce

proceedings. If couan fails. a.

lawyer is then responsible for mak-
ing an equitable settlement.”

She pauses. thinks. and identiﬁes
another area that poses legal tangles
for the student: the Telephone Com-
pany. Five years ago. twenty five
telephones on campus were acciden-
tally ticd up to the university
switchboard. The students using
these phones were not being billed
for their calls. and took advantage of
the situation by calling such places as
South America. At the end of the
year. the telephone company dis-
covered their mistakc and sent out
bills of $800 and $l000. "The
students were legally bound to pay."
she said.

A coughing spell interrupts
Leventhal. so she sips water from a
little dixie cup. Unperturbed. she
continues. “If a person moves out of
his suite or apartment without pay-
ing his sharcofthe telephone bill. the
other inhabitants are responsible for
total payment. It‘s like a
partnership."

Leventhal finds it most difficult to
give legal advice in cases of motor
vehicle violations. “it‘s simply the
student's word against the
policcmun‘s."

Working amongall males presents
few problems. says Leventhal who is
single. “I find they treat me as a
woman and as an equal. yet they
recognize my unique problems.They
understand if I have to leave work
early to prepare a dinner party. I‘m
respected as a professional. but the
men still pick up my lab when we go

out to eat.“ she kids.

“The hours are incredible. lurrive
at the office at 7:30am. and leave at
o p.m. That doesn‘t include the
nights I have to appear in court."
Although the office maintains a 24-
hour a nswering service to handle late
night calls. Leventhal says her
telephone number is listed in the
local directory if a student finds it
necessary to contact her immediate-
ly. “Regardless of the late hour. I'm
still going to hpr the strident."
