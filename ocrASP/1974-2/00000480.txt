 

V  of the actions of    sociology Department is coming apart at

I ‘, f. th I seams. The controversy building Within the department threatens to tearit's foun-’ '

dations away due primarily to intense intro-departmental dislike-for Ray Foreré’ihe
7 Department Chairman. The situationin the department can only grow worse, unless
President Benezet decides to begin the search fora new chairman. The already crippled
department is trying to bind itself together—m least until after the State Education
Department sends'in its scholars to rate the department. Students do not need to be
strung along for the ride by, the Administration which appears to be waiting until at

least January before committing itself and the University to another three year ‘

renewal. Come January they will probably re-appoint this man who has shown a
record of intimidation and abuse of his firing powers by eliminating thoe who speak
V out against him. '

Forer admits he may have been in error in some of his past actions. “Perhaps my
wording was a bitharsh in some cases; [would apologize for that. but ldo not think the
substance of anything I said was in error.” He was referring to several letters of
transmittal to the Council on Promotions and Continuing Appointments in which he
stooped to personal insults against people who were up for either tenure or promotion.
He has put at least one letter of apology into one department member's file, but this
name-calling indicates an unprofessional manner (at best) in approaching his job.

Department members feel more than uncomfortable around the man. Forerpins the
blame for this attitude on four tenured faculty who are out to “get him." But it appears
that more than simply those four are opposed to what has been described as his
"ruthless" tactics. The problem is that the junior faculty members do not want to say
anything, for fear of being denied tenure, and the graduate students are afraid to open-
ly criticize the man, for fear that their degrees will be jeopardized. Six junior faculty
members once criticized Forer for not allowing them to participate in the selection
process for a new chairman. Not one of these six is now teaching at SUNYA: all were
subsequently denied reappointment, before they even reached tenure review.

By no means is the administration clean in this whole affair. The name of Sirotkin
and Kendall continually reappear wherever there is a question of denial of a faculty
member’s academic rights. In this case, Sirotkin. ignored protests by senior faculty
members over the way the department was being'run. Theydid not'listeti to grievances
by faculty who complained about treatment within the department.

The situation within this department is in some respects akin to that of other
departments. but other departments do not have the chairman. who some feel may not
be able to get tenure at another university. They do not have a chairman who uses in—
timidation and coercion to make people agree to his policies. They do not havea chair-
man who is afraid ofanyone who he thinks could look better than him in an evaluation.
They do not have a chairman who openly admits he does not know the new methods in
his? discipline.

It is now up to the administration. Will they keep this man who uses phrases like a
“caricature of an academic" to describe his colleagues. Will they continue to condone
the actions. merely because the power of the chairmanship is behind him, or will they
seek someone new, someone else from the department, who could come in with a
strong background, someone who could remedy the battered department and con-
struct one that does not have to spend time rebutting accusations their chairman
makes?

The answer to those questions is self-evident. The ad ministration - President Benezet
and Vice-President Sirotkin - must decide to deny reappointment. But this is not
enough, they must also account for their failure to respond to complaints from faculty
members, complaints voiced three years ago and longer.

Post script

It is curious that in light ofthe trauma of Watergate, due in great part to the efforts at
its cover-up, that the administration would take such great pains to conceal discontent
within its walls. Surely it is no great crime to admit that some administrative and
academic appointments were made in haste, or turned out unsuCCessfully. It would be
too much to ask ofanyone that every decision be the right one. The cloud ofsuspieion
only arises at overt attempts to hide the facts, to cover-up.

Chances Are Things Could Change

The Democratic Party is now lirme en-
trenchcd in power on the federal level of
government. It is interesting to attempt some
predictions of how the party will dissipate its
advantage by I976.

It is a simple truth of our two party system
that fortunes rise and fall with each turn of
events. What appears to bean invincible front
of Democrats might easily crumble in a
relatively short period oftime. What tiresome
ol' tltc possibilities?

l. The Democrats could proceed on the
assumption that this year‘s elections were a
sweeping mandntc for them. instead of the
truth; that Americans have mct‘ely repudiated
the Republican party. Perhaps repudiate is
too harsh a term; reprimand is perhaps more
applicable. Anyway. the Democrats may be
tempted by circunstnnccs to nominate a man
such as (icorgc McGovern, someone with a
limited appeal. for thc Presidency again. He
proved his inexperience with sortie un-
belicvttblc campaign blunders in l972. and by
emphasizing some possible legislation that
was attacked mercilessly and successfully by
Richard Nixon and other Republicans.

The point is. though. that a weak
Democratic nominee would quite possibly
lengthen the couttails of the Republican. and
at the very least, reduce the Dcmocruts'
holdings to it figure well below the over two~
thirds of the seals they now control. Inciden-
tally. with Tcd Kennedy out ofthe race, none
of the present aspirants for the nomination
seem overly dangerous to President Ford.

2. Ford could see his economic policies bear
fruit in the form of reduced unemployment
and a reasonably lessened rule ofinflution. If
his programs follow the plan. noticeable im-
provement will occur sometime in late 1975 or
early I976.

Of course. that timing is excellent for
November election. The recovery will his:

matter how loud the Democratic nllcmpls lIl
taking credit for it, it will almost certainly be
the President. and consequently.
Republicans, who will gain most from no on-
proved economic situation. This gall! to
prestige can safely be translated Inltl .Itl-
ditional Republican seats.

3. President Ford mayalso attempt to outlo-

policies lag in effectiveness. He could powhlt
