Introspective. . . .

A while ago I read a critique by Kate Millet on D. H. Lawrence's
Lady Chatterley’s Lover. Usually supportive of feminist writing, I
was, this time, enraged by her inability to see the different levels of
meaning. I believe she mis represented Laurentian characters and
misinterpreted dialogue. She had characters shouting things
where Lawrence had them speaking softly. It's a very different thing
tto gently say to a woman “lie down” than it is when you shout at her
0 o 1 . '

I think I've just pulled a Kate Millet on Jules Feiffer.l read this
week 8 cartoon and didn’t want it printed. I felt degraded by his
exaggeration and his depiction of such a non-existent stereotype.
He wouldn't put a man in such a useless, stupid role.

NOVEMBER 12, 1974

 

by Barbara Fischkin
CBS Elections News Correspondent
Linda Ellerby gave in to the little man's
harried attempts to move herearring to
a point'dead center on her left earlobe. 1
That was the extent of the “test run."

It couldn't progress to her right ear ‘1

because Ramsey Clark, with his elec-
tion eve hopes not yet worn down by
discouraging results, came in and stole
the show.

After things quieted down again
among the Clark supporters gathered
in the Commodore Hotel’s Windsor
Room in New York, Ms. Ellerby said:

"The network producers all knew

when Clark was coming out. It was 

planned that way so that all three
network cameras could get an ideal
angle. The three major networks get
together, but when minor newspapers
and student newspapers come it is a
push and a shove. 1 much prefer
covering fires. Thisis more hassle than
excitement."

To others, waiting for the final tallies
at the Commodore Hotel's Democratic
headquarters and at the Republican
enclave in the nearby Roosevelt Hotel,
the hassle was the excitement.
Broadcasters, reporters, bartenders,
actors, employees, mothers, children,
candidates, mothers of candidates,
Sisters of candidates, children of
candidates, neighbors of candidates,
priests, Hasidic lews, foremen, bums,
waiters, Pinkertons, students,
supporters and friends were
celebrating, crying, playing, singing,
iitterbugging, arguing, screaming,
writing, drinking, acting, praying and
applauding. One woman stopped to
realize that she couldn't remember
who ran against Rockefeller last time,
but for many the celebration blurred
out political consciousness.

It was street theatre, the movies,
Broadway and television all crammed
into four large rooms in two hotels and
spilling out into the surrounding halls,
elevators, lobbies and suites. The city,
itself was infected. Some who didn't
make it into midtown still managed to
get on the six o'clock news by showrrig
up at their favorite department store's
election day sale. Those at home could
watch it all and when the program
switched to Walter Cronkite
discussing the economy they could
swrtch to Channel Five and see
Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca in
order not to spoil the mood.

The mood was helped by scenery.
liar from being advocates of the empty
stage, the producers of both the
Roosevelt and Commodore
extr‘avnqaiizas were deliberate iii their
choice of sets. At Wilson and lavrts
headquarters supporters were hit over
the head With America. Plastic red,
white and blue blossoms were all over
the walls. Each one was precrsely the
same distance from the floor and not
more or less than three feet away from
the one next to If. In contrast, Clark
supporters hiid fashioned a patchwork
quilt With "Ramsey" sewn in yellow
lullul'ti The only red, white and blue
was it] a flag sitting unutJti-usrvely iii
the corner of the stage. The band
played Cabaret and the people
danced, ignoring, much like Sally

Bowles, the oncoming disaster.

stage were larger than life black and
whites: A smiling Mary Anne, a
smiling Hugh and, in the center,
eleven Careys, all smiling. There were
also signs like, "We were Number One
to endorse Carey-the Bronx-Pelham
Reform Democratic Club."They were
all homemade with magic marker and
oaktag.

In these settings the candidates
could be movie stars, Broadway stars,
even vaudevillians, if they had to.

Fade in to Carey acceptance
speech.

Hugh Carey yells, "Stop the music!"
Mary Anne Krupsakmust do the same.
Robert Abrams, candidate for
Comptroller doesn't know yet whether
he has won or lost and maybe that's
why he has more trouble than the
others getting the band to stop.
Uh..,take two.

Some of the stars, though, don'teven
need settings. All they need isahall.

Fade in to ball outside Carey suite on
twenty first floor.

Reporters wait outside the guarded
suite, ignoring remarks trom aides like,
"1 wish these people would get the hell
out of here," Bella Abzug, who is
running again for Congress, dashes
out in a long flowing, black cape and a
red, widerbrimmed hat, which, even
on her, looks like an exaggeration. She
confers quretly with one privileged
reporter, losing composure at the end
and exclaiming, "I never said that!"
Never said what?...But, she is off not
even hearing that or "How can she
wear that coat in New York?"

Fade out,

Those who represented television
were really on televrsion and all too
often they lived up to their stereotypes.

News Team touched his perfectly
corffured hair and searched the room

“What's your name?"

"lohn Conally and yours?"

"Barbara Fischkin."

"Oh yes. Of coursel"

"From the Albany Student Press?"

"oh..."

lohn Johnson, 'a member of the
Eyewitness News Team, in Clark
headquarters, wasn't much better. His
long arms served him well as he
pushed ASP Associate News Editor,
Mike Sena, out of his key place next to
Ramsey Clark, leaving Mike only with
fantasies that went like this:

"I went over to him later and said,
'You know Mister lohnson that was a
really bad thing you did, pushing me
like that!"'

'l'm sorry son. Come up and see me
any time and l'll give you a job.’ "

The street theatre, which took place
inside, was more real. The observers
became the participants and at times
they outdid the originals.

Carey, while giving his acceptance
speech was rivaled and, at times,
successfully upstaged by a gloriously
drunk, beaming, beautiful, frish
compatriot with white hair, a red face
and blue eyes more striking than
anything ever seen on television. He
had been singing and dancing and
leading the uWe want Carey. WE
WANT CAREY." chants all evening.
Now that he had gotten what he
wanted he took the victory personally.
While Carey spoke he cheered so
frantically it was a wonder the Dillon,
Carey and "Take an Irishman to
Lunch" buttons that he had pinned on
his white suit didn't come rolling off
onto the floor.

Street theatre knew no bounds. At
the Commodore it became vertical

became evident that the only way up
or down was the stairs...until someone
discovered the freight elevators. That
worked well until the Pinkerton caught
on and refused to let you get off once
you had gotten on. So, it was back to
the elevators just in time to hear a man
get on and proudly announce to a
group of strangers, "l'm Bob Abrams’

.wife's father!"

With the losers the ending wasn't
quite as happy.

Two supporters at Wilson
headquarters as the bad news comes
over the tube:

"You know they predict Carey to
win."

"Yeah, better luck next time."

"I wanted the death penalty
reinstated."

"Maybe Carey'll do it."

"Nah, he'll never do it."

“I'm gonna haffta buy a shotgun."

"Yeah, we're all gonna i haffta buy
shotguns."

And we, as ASP reporters planted in
the middle of these scenes to do or die
were part of the show, be it comedy or
tragedy. We tasted twine in the
Guv'nor Steak House at a, table next to
ABC correspondent, Melba Tolliver,
and with the sudden realization that we
were no longer in the Campus Center
cafeteria ,got into it.

We sat next to AP reporters and le.
them explain the "inverted pyramid"
method to us three times over. We told
ianitors that they could not sit at our
phones in the Windsor Room. We had
payed for them. We were reporters.

We walked into the room designated
"Press Only" at Clark headquarters
and frustrated by our inability to find
out anything, were comforted by cries
like, "it's impossible to get any
information. Do you know what's
going on? 1 don't know what's going
on. i think I’ll call the citydeskand 
what came over the AP machine'
They were the pros and they were
having the same problems.

Later we wrote in a hurry,
surrounded by coffee and cigarette
butts, in a frenzied attempt to make the
deadline. Someone said, "We're like
real journalists. We're slobs." (We
thought we were real journalists).

It was a hard act to shake.

"l don't want to go back to shcool.
This is too much fun."

"You'd get sick of it soon—all the
phoniness."

"I don't know..."

But, out on the street at 6:30 AM,
running to the subway and watching
the drunks wake up from their
makeshift beds in doorways of stores, it
was easy to know. The subway token
didn't fit in the slotand it was a bleary-
eyed search to find a turnstile that
wasn't broken. Thoughts of promises
made by former politicians in former
campaigns, promises to get drunks off
the streets and into homes, promises to
fix up public transportation, all came to
mind and blended with the
acceptance speeches of the night
before.

The television in the window was
showing oarly moming reruns of the
Commodore and Roosevelt speeches.
They all looked very stale.
