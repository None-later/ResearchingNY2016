_ From April 17, 1967 - April 18,

The United Farm Workers Union,

"AFL-CIO was the exclusive

bargaining agent for all Gallo
Winery, E & I agricultural
employees. With the signing of the
first contract, conditions drastically
changed. Wages increased,
bathroom facilities and fresh drink-
ing water were present in the fields,
child labor came to an end,
dangerous pesticides were closely
supervised, and there was es-
tablished a Union hiring hall with
the consequent elimination of the
hated labor contract system which
brutalized and humiliated workers.
The Hiring Hall established hiring
an the basis of seniority and gave
workers for the first time, job securi-
ty.

April, 1970

Gallo renewed this first contract for
an additional three years. The new
contract provided for increased
wages and additional benefits. The
Robert F. Kennedy plan gave.
workers their first medical in-
surance coverage. As Ranch Com-
mittees became more active,
workers became increasingly more
involded in matters related to the
Union.

GALLO VERSION

Aug. 7,1967

After verification of the signatures,
it was found that a majority of the
farm workers had signed cards say-
ing they wanted to be represented
by the UFW. Gallo thereupon
recognized the UFW.

Sept. 21,1967
Agreement with UFW signed to run?
to April 18,1970.

April 13,15,& 18, 1970
A second three-year contract was
negotiated and signed between
Gallo and the UFW for three years
expiring April 18, 1973.

March 22, 1973

According to the minutes of the
March 22nd meeting: Gallo pointed
out that UFW had not even
presented their list of proposed
changes, as required by the terms of
their 1970 contract. UFW agreed to
submit this list at the next meeting,
scheduled for March 29th. The
UFW requested an extension of
their 1970 contract, which was
denied.

March 28, 1973

Burciaga called Deatrick and
cancelled the meetings scheduled
for March 29th and March 30th.

May 18,1973

On receipt of Bob Gallo’s letter,
Cesar Chavez advised he did not
agree there was a contest between
two unions, and that there should
be an immediate election. Without
laws governing union election
procedures, and binding all parties
involved, the employer is
vulnerable to lawsuits and boycotts
by the losing union. We knew that
Gallo farm workers were being
pressured by the UFW to sign peti-
lion cards and the UFW could have
Presented these to us if they had a
majority.

not understand why the UFW was

Story appears in the Fresno,

under the headline “Chavez asks
for election by Gallo.”

RJ. Gallo telegrams Cesar Chavez:
“You misunderstood our previous
communications. The Teamsters do
not represent our workers . . . . We
can continue negotiations at any
time."

David Burciaga calls Deatrick to set
the next meeting.

Ranch Superintendent Bernardi
and Supervisor Landucci accom-
pany Teamsters into the fields.

During negotiations Deatrick is
pressed on why Gallo is refusing an
electionHe answers: "We have no
reason to believe that no one but
you represents the workers. An
election just delays things.”

June 7, 1973

Feliciano Urrutia who worked for
Gallo since 1958 is fired for his
membership and support of UFW.

June 26, 1973

Gallo distributes a letter to all
workers stating that the Teamsters
have given notice that they repre-
sent a majority, and that Gallo is
scheduling a meeting with them im-
mediately. Two strong Union
members, including one on the
Ranch Committee are fired for
protesting the letter.

July 3, 1973

A delegation of six Catholic priests
and sisters led by Sister Joyce
Higgins meet with HJGallo to urge
elections. He declines, stating it is
“too complicated, " but he does
agree to a card count of authoriza-
tion Cards.

July 6, 1973

David Burciaga gives the religious
group signed authorization cards
from J73 of the 222 Gallo workers
on the pay rollon April 18, when the
contract expired. Sister Joyce
Higgins telegrams R.J.Gallo asking
him to examine the proof. Gallo
refuses to answer her phone calls
and does not acknowledge the
telegram in spite of the earlier
ptct‘nlse to honor the Card Check.

Tennister Director James Smith an-
nounces that Gallo has recognized

June 20, 1973 _

What turned out to be the final
negotiation session took place. At
this meeting, Gallo pointed out that
the union still had not submitted its
economic proposals, and that in the
previous bleven (11) meetings, the
company had demonstrated con-
siderable flexibility in their position
on all resolved and unresolved
issues. Yet the union to date had
failed to indicate any flexibility in
their position on several key items,
including Hiring Hall and Union
Discipline, which Gallo wanted to
conform with N.L.R.A. re-
quirements.

June 25, 1973

A letter from the Western Con-
ference of Teamsters was delivered
to Gallo claiming that the Teamsters
represented the majority of Gallo
farm workers, and asking for a
meeting to prove this claim.

June 27, 1973

Before a meeting could be held to
verify or disprove the Teamsters'
claim, the UFW established a picket
line at the Gallo vineyards. Since
the UFW had been soliciting signed
cardsfrom Gallo farmworkers for at
least a month, it could have proven
llS majority status, if it really
represented a majority of Gallo
farm workers, by presenting its
signed cards to Gallo. It did not do
so.

July 6, 1973

After verifying signatures on the
petitions submitted by the
Teamsters against payroll records,
it was determined that a majority of
all Gallo farm workers (including
those who went on strike June 27th)
had requested that the Teamsters be
their collective bargaining agent.
The teamsters submitted proof of
majority preference; and the UFW
evidently had not been able to ob-
tain such proof. It was obvious that
neither union would agree to the
ground rules for an impartially
supervised election, or agree to
give up the fight if they lostthe elec-
tion. In the absence of any legal
mechanism to require both unions
to agree on an election procedure,
and to be bound by its result, Gallo
had to make the verification against
personnel and payroll records. As a
result,aletter was sentio Gallofarm
workers stating that Gallo would
recognize the Teamsters as the
bargaining agent for Gallo farm
workers and negotiations would
commence.

July 8, 9, & 10, 1973

Negotiations commenced the mor-
ning of July 8th, continued July 9th,
and an agreement was concluded
on July 10th. Included on the
Teamsters’ negotiating committee
were four Gallo farm workers
(formerly UFW members). The con-
tract was ratified by an overwhelm-
ing majority of the farm workers.

 

Act of 1935, a bill which outlined un-'
ion ﬁghts, excluded, agricultural
workers. The UFW cites grower
pressure and they're right.

However, the Wagner Act was
mdr‘cal; it changed the New Deal
legislation which the Supreme Court
said was unconstitutional so that it was
constitutional. But there was a great
deal of concern about the working
man, and the bill passed only because
it did exclude agricultural workers.
Many congressmen, especially from
the South, would vote "no"otherwise.

The yea rs went by, and by the end of
World War II, unions were a powerful

.force in the United States. Their power

was so great that businesses felt
threatened, and in 1948 Congress
passed the Taft-Hartley Act which out-
lawed certain "unfair" labor practices.
They included secondary boycotts and
strikes and boycotts based on jurisdic-
tional disputes.

The fa rmworkers never got organiz-
ed and thus didn't grow as the other
unions did. The Taft-Hartley Act
limited‘ unions after they were es-
tablished and powerful, but those limits
made it extremely difficult for the
farmwarkers to get organized. They
had always been ignored by the major
unions, since they were very difficult to
organize. For example, there can only
be one or two entrances to a factory.
Ptckets can easily block the entrance.
Farms can be reached in almost any
direction and at any point, This is a
problem the UFW often faced. They
would set up pickets in two or three
places, but scabs could still be brought
in at other places.

Chavez' UFW grew, due mostly to
their own efforts but their efforts would
have failed Without the large amount of
flllrlllCchtl and moral support they
received from the AFL-CIO.

The UFW forced elections, forced
growers to sign contracts, and lil-
creased pay. They found the growers
usn'ig scab labor, ignoring agreements
and the like. Their boycotts were often
effective In fighting the growers.

The boycotts had othereffects. Every
worker along the line from the fields to
the shelves were hit by the boycotts.
