The can; Tree was about a young boy'whohad his
, town apple'tr’ee. Ashegrew older heusedthe applesto sell
' and make money. cut down the branches to build himself

a home, took the trunk to build a boat and left only a
stump. It was not until years later that he truly ap~
preeiated the tree. He was an old man. and he used the

stamp to rest his tired body upon.

In The Dead Birdti group of young children playing
together, find a dead bird. ,They bury it and hold a
funeral for it. They then resume their play. They return
to the grave often and sing by it as a memorial. The story
shows the children'sii'trat encounter with death.

' The third story was probably the most appreciated by
the young audience. In Where the Wild Things Are. a

 

was a good

The cast rehearsed for about three weeks. I spoke to

‘ one of the members of the cast and he told me that he
preferred adult theatre. but it did not detract from the
performance. The actors seemed to relate well with their

parts.

The entire show was only about a half hour long but

most five year olds get restless after this amount of time
anyway. As I walked out I asked a few children what
they thought of the plays. One said he liked TV better but

' most were quite entertained. I hope that there is another
“Afternoon for Children” this year. College doesn't have
to be complicated all the time.

Last» Weekend's Lovers and Other
Strangers used only two of the‘
movie's four interrelated skits. and
didn’t tie them together, but let‘each

stand on its own. Joseph Bologna »

and Renee Taylor, who are
themselves married, wrote a funny
script that ultimately copped out in
the end. _ .

.Director Sharon' Swerdlofi‘s
production was excellent; she made
good use of the Arena area in both
scenes. The first, titled “Brenda and
Jerry,” was about a very well-read
pick-up who spends the entire even-
ing quoting from such authoritative
sources as Sex and the Single Girl
and sex and‘the Single Man before
throwing herself at the man. Brenda
was Mindy Bailin, and Jerry was
Scott Westover. Bailin was a
caricature of the Cosmopolitan
woman. She playedhard-to-getuntil
he started getting discouraged, then
said. “You‘llneverleam themeaning
of reciprocal giving—then take, I'll
give for both of us.“ She was totally
given up to the idea of being a sex
kitten, no matter what she spouted
about "love."

 

The play used thcdiffcrent exits oi'
the Arena well, and made good use
of some sound effects such as the
ﬂushing of a toilet. The acting was
stiff in the beginning. and loosened
up near the end when the two actors
ended up in Jerry‘s bed. grappling

frantically. , Bailin’s besi scene was
where she rubbed an imaginary
sticky icecream pop from her hands.

Johnny and Wilma

The second piaylet, titled "Johnny
and Wilma." was easily the stronger
of the two. The acting was much
more confident throughout. and
blocking was much more im-
aginative. It included the two actors
pacing around on top of their bed.
like two sumo wrestlers feeling each
other out. E_qual use was made of the
three pieces of furniture. and the ac-
tion was more spread out.

Wilma and Johnny weren't mak-
ing love much anymore, because
Johnny felt his male supremacy be-
ing threatened. The two ran through
enough insults and threats to give
Don Rickles material for a year. The
essential problem with the
characters was the man. Lcn
Scibilia. was not strong enough to
give in;and thcwoman. Holly Fitter.
was. It was less important to her to
force an issue than it was to him.
Giving in took more strength and
confidence than holding out.

The main problem with the two
plays was their superﬁciality. They
were funny but forgettable. cute but
tasteless in the end. The other fault
was that there was no connection
between the two. and neither was
really strong enough to stand on
their own.
