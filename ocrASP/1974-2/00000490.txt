Women-Is 

by Mlndy Altman

The living room was warm and
cozy and every inch of sitting
space—chairs and floor—was taken
up. The atmosphere was friendly as
the cross section of people who made

up the group—women and men’

from various walks of life—~chatted
quietly. waitin g for the guest speaker
to arrive.

Out in the kitchen Mu. Fraya Katz
was scurrying about. putting bottles
of ginger ale together on a tray. and
talking to different people about up-
coming events und plans.

Katz is one of the founders of
AWARE (Albany Women Aguinst
Rape).

The purpose of. this particular
meeting was so that group members

and other interested individual:
could learn about the legal aspect: of
rape. The guest spaker wanttorney
Mark Pellegrino of the Diltrict At-
torney‘s office who came to conduct
the evening’s “writkship” by presen-
tlng and explaining material about
rape law.

Beforcvthe workship got under
way. Katz discussed AWARE: how
it got started and where it was
heading. According to her. about I
year and a half ago. Katz and a
number of women of the Capital
District Women. formed a study
group on rape. The study group.
consisting of about ﬁfteen women.
soon dissolved. Katz wanted to con-

tinue doing something so that more ‘

people could be informed about

been attacked could be helped. She
began to look for interested people
to form a rape group. <. .

At the beginning of this semester.
her hopes were realized. Kntz gave I
speech in the Washington Park area
during Women's Day. and as a
result. wasable to get a numberofin-
terested people together. She
emphasized that these people were
different from others she had tried to
work_with: they cdhsisted of people
what were willing to form an
organization and make it work. and
not just take an easy out by joining
an existing group.

Out of this. AWARE was born. It
is made up of a cross section of peo-
ple including persons from Capital

Dintricl. Women.
