in a telephone interview Tuesdays
“Where you‘ve got unall operators,
you know they‘re not going to take a
chance on anyone getting hurt." '

Ofﬁcials said 2! state facilities der
pend on coal.

Although major utility companies
and many of the state's 55 coal-
dependent industries have coal
stockpiles. the state has no “set-'
aside” program in which a reserve
supply is doled out by the state.

Edwards said, that if the state is
able to buy from independent
miners, costs will be higher than they
have_been.

'The independents will take ad-
vantage and the price will go up." he
said. “We checked with one of the in-
dependent operators and they
quoted a price now of 820 above the
going rate for coal.” Edwards said
attempts were also being» made to
convince the U MW leadership to sell
stockpiles for emergency services.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the
New YorﬂPower Pool said that even
a lengthydrike would not affect the
state's electrical generating capabili-
ty.
“We don‘t envision any coal strike
to have any effect on the generation
.of electricity or the reliability of elec-
trical services." Bryan Gosling said.
He said only I2 percent ofthc state‘s
electrical generating capacity re-
quires coal as the primary energy
source. And he noted that inventory
coal supplies at most station sites
“are generally in excess of 80days.“

NOVEMBER 15, 1974

 ,ﬂ 

by Ira Zia-cued
Pulitzer Prize winner David

' Halberstam told an audience of 350
‘that the nation

g is‘ plagued by
governmental imbalance at the
Federal level and 'a lack of control of
its science and technology. The 40'
year old author of the best selling
study of political powerrin America,
The Best and the Brighlest, also
declared that the Democratic
landslide in last week‘s elections did
not amount to a" mandate.
Halbcrstam's appearance Monday
night was part of a busy schedule of .
programs sponsored by the Univer-
sity Speakers Forum and supported
by student tax revenues.

Dressed conservatively with a
light blue shirt. dark tie. and solid
navy blue jacket. the six footer who
ran track at Roosevelt High School
in Yonkers projected an image of
low key confidence. In an at-
mosphere shaped by extinguished
ballroom house lights and blazing
spotlights. the grcying Halbcrstam
spoke informally of “diffused”
Watcrgatcs. "imperial" prcsidencics
and "uncontrolled" technology.
Democratic Victory A Republican
' Punishment

Halbcrslam. educated at Harvard.
stated that the Democrats had failed
to bring a past record and future
program dealing with Watcrgateand
the economy to the public. “There
was no clear choice. nothing to ex-
hort the people to the polls." com-
mented the journalist. He believes
that an uninspired electorate merely
punished a law and order ad-
ministration for its lawlessness and

ineptneis in handling the economy.
Their punishment was not meant to
acclaim the Democrats. '
A Din Political Future

Projecting into the political
future, Halberstam forseesaworsen-
lng economy which will "thh” the
Democrstic majority in Congress
and aid is presidential‘bid by Gerald
Ford in I976.

The political commentator
remarked that we were lucky to have

Richard Nixon as President, for,

Nixon warned us of a great im-
balance of power. “We have created
a super presidency  a presidency
characterized by a lack of restraint.“
He maintained that a long bred
“myth of presidential omniscience“
has enabled the chief executive of the
U.S. to invoke "presidential
privilege" and hide the truth from
the public in the name of "national
security." In addition. he argued that
a Cold War against communism has
empowered several presidents to
ﬁght off domestic opponents. Con-
gress was unable to stop or question
the growth of the executive branch.
Nor was it expanding to meet the
needs imposed by a new and com-
plex technology. Only now is Con-
gress “modemizing.” according to
Halberstam.

As a journalist since I955,
Halbcrstam senses what he terms a
“moral dcsensilizing" in our
governmental processes which
makes it routine for a Hunt and a
Liddy to break into the opposition
party‘s national headquarters. Even
before Watergate. Halberstam
stated that such a mentalitv is to be

‘ Halberstam” attacked former
Defense Secretary Robert Mac- '

Namara as the “poet laureate of the ”

Ford Company.” He thundered that
those who were responsible for the
Southeast Asian War “have yet to be

accountable for what they did in'

Vietnam.“ ‘  'v -
A Third Party: The White House
He continued by claiming that the
erosion of the political system has
been accompanied'by the growth of
a “three party system: the
Democrats. the Republicans. and
the White House.“ The shift in the
delegation of power in the last 20 to

30 years has witnessed an usurpation ‘

of State Department functions by
the CIA. so more and more infor-
mation could be classified and kept
from the public. ‘

llalbcrstam asserted that by the
early I960‘s the C.l./\. had already
determined that it would take “seven
years and one million men to win in
Victnam...Had that information
been in the public domain. we
wouldn't have gone to war." The
veteran correspondent concluded.
“those who controlled the statistics.
controlled the war."

Were he to redo his book on the
Kennedy-Johnson years,
Halberstam said that he would
“make much more of Tonkin." the
military incident‘which in effect led
to a vote in Congress enabling Presi-
dent Johnson lo wage war without a
formal declaration. He said that the
secrecy behind the U.S. role in an—
tagonizing the event was to bcsymp-
tomntic of things to come.

Halbcrstatn does feel a sense of'

dashed hopes. He feels that Presi-
dent Johnson‘s "dream for a Great
Society and a small war" ended up a
“semi-Great Society and a scmi-
large war."
Executive Coverage

Criticiring the media. Halhcrstam
complained that “all science and
technology worked. . .for the Presi-
dent." He thinks that we must
“rendopt to our technology.“ as the
media has aided the inordinate
growth in power of the executive
branch. In fact. stated this writer for
several newspapers. it was only a

ticular paranoia. . .that made the
press look a great deal more
aggressive than it was."

Halberstam praised CBS cor-
respondent Dan Rather as a man
who assumed the mic of “the proxy
opposition" in a scheme where no
one countered the President on a 22
minute nightly newscast. Rather
had ﬁlled in for those who would
have permitted the President to
come to the screen unchallenged and
unexplained.

Television news was little more
than a "vehicle of the presidency."
charged Halbcrstam. In a state vs.
anti-slate situation. the Stale was
winning and the, media only oc-
casionally ended up on thcanti-statc
side. in raw time of news coverage
the executive obscured the two other
sharers of' federal power. Only when
the President made his annual State
of the Union Message did the
cameras turn to Capital Hill. Onc
network president referred to the ex-
ecutive in Washington as the "elec-
lronic presidency.“

Focusing More On Congress

Whereas the Fulbright Hearings
of I966 marked a “rear moment"
when critics of the executive branch
got equal time. congressional ex-

posure is now becoming more
prevalent. according to Halbcrstam.

The audience responded with
laughter and applause to

.Halberslam's use of former Presi-

dent Nixon's trip to China as an ex-
ample of the media‘s ovcrcoverage of
the executive. What made “news”
was a President viewing the Great
Wall and exclaiming to the Secretary
of State by his side. "It isa great wall.
isn‘t it?” The Secretary replied. “Yes.
Mr. President it is a great wall."
Halberstam stated that he was used
to such a rendering of the word
"news" for as a New York Times
Correspondent in Vietnam he and
his colleagues had labelled the late
afternoon official army "news" con-

ferences as “the ﬁve o‘clock follies.”
