,ugcliools. These programs, for the most part, were construction-oriented, deisgned to

“relieve, the over—crowding at many Universities and Colleges. Chancellor Boyer was
reported as having said that last year there was no way to keep students on campus in
the dormatories. while this year, due to the inﬂated cost of living off-campus. it is im-
possible to keep them away. I ; _

It is a wonder then that the Regents sees the necessity to cunail programs to relieve
the over-crowding and perhaps even improve academic services on some campuses.

' Yesterday, it was reported that SUNY enrollment climbed to 406,000 students of which
over 250,000 were full time equivalents. Thattotal is an increase from 384,000 last year.
I The boom years of the SUNY system may be over, but now certainly is not the time to
doom the hopes,.of students, faculty, and administrations who had looked to the

 programs as panaceas in the fight against the encroaching over-crowding.

The Regents have decreed that until the population decline catches up to the college
age population, studentsfor the next ﬁfteen years will have to suffer the inconvenience
now for the betterment of the future. Noble goals, but ill~timed. It is a pity to condemn
an essentially benevolent gesture on the part of the Regents, especially one that doesn't
have a built-in obsolecence factor, but the Regents had better give the thought of a
blanket freeze on expansion some serious reconsideration before imposing it on the
coming generations of students. '

Defeating the Purpose

In theera of Watergate it may be hard to pat ourselves on the back, but careful obser-
yation of other would indicate that we're far from the worst. We are fortunate. in a
sense. to have the United Nations on our shores so we can see the world’s “diplomats”
engaged in vicious polemics,ftercelyexpounding their various issues. while making an
all too futile effort at talking sense. Not that the U.N. is useless entirely, but its success
ratio leaves much to be desired.

A recent example of the common pointless U.N. rhetoric was the suspension of
South Africa from this session of the General Assembly. There is no doubt that South
Africa's system of apartheid is blatantly unfair, exploitative and disgusting. Under in-
tense. pressure from the entire world (and from blacks and whites within the country)
South .Africa has made some signiﬁcant if small steps towards ending their absurd
domestic policies.

But there is also no doubt that at least the ruling white minority is being ruled
democratically, and that many of the countries that pushed most strongly for South
Africa‘s suspension are simple totalitarian dictatorships, where no one but the coun-
try‘s leader and the rich elite class have power.

In the Security Council a few weeks ago, the United States, Britain and France
properly blockedthe complete expulsion of South Africa. Whatever the actual reason
for the three vetoes, they are in line with a rational view ofwhat the UN. is supposed to
represent: the powers that be. Countries that do not truly represent their people could
not be forced out of the U.N. simply because there are only a handful ofcountries that
can make that claim. Countries like Nigeria.the U.S. and ‘. ‘Pakistan might be exclud-
ed, but why stop there? U ganda's General Idi Amin has been accused of murdering im-
migrant Asians; surely he has seized their property and kicked thousands out of their
home of centuries. The Soviet Union imprisons with impunity, Spain continues to op-
press the Basques, Greece only recently has turned away from militarism, Iraq op-
presses the tribal Kurds and South Vietnam, well, much has already been written of
that catastrophe.

SouthAfrica deserves censure, and pressure, but as long as people are controlled
there, they should be in the U.N. Otherwise, we must start reviewingevery nation in the
international order.

Suspension or expulsion defeats the purpose it pretends to serve.

In Washington:

,The I974 Election Message

 

WASHINGTON — Of last week‘s mid-
term elections it could honestly be said that
never in the course of television history has so
much been made by so many of so little.

Why, to hear the network executives tell it,
the whole course of the ship was about to be
altered as never before by this one trip to the
pilot house.

of course, all that was baldcrdash of the
variety for which television executives have
become famous. They are your original
balderdashers, paralleled in American history
only by the 19th century travelling medicine
men.

The plain fact is that there was nothing un-
usual about the size or character of last
Tuesday's Democratic congressional gains.
The party which is lookirtg into rather than
out of the windows at I600 Pennsylvania
Avenue generally makes inroads in off-year
'electto_n§, and when that puny happens to be

lbree times i the size of its opposition to start
with.thoscinroads often are large.

Still, the times are bit strange. Here we are
the democracy of democracies, and we have ti
President who has not been elected, a vice-
prestdent-designate who is an appointee of an
appotntee, and a new congress for whom only
38 per cent of us even bothered to vote.

Even for an off-year election, a 38 per cent
’tprnout is low, by six-to-eight percentage
points, and that fact demonstrates as
emphatically as any the low state in which
Americans hold their political leaders in-
cumbents and contenders alike. .

Those who did bother to vote. however ex-
pressed a sentiment that was not so much tinti-
Republican as it was anti-incumbent. True a
lot of Republicans lost, but there were also
quite a few so-called “safe-district" Democrats
who lhll year were returned by unusually
narrow margins.

Moreover, remember that his
Republicans who did lose were frohlidiiirl'x
that are traditionally Democratic, and these

people were in office in the first place only
because of Richard Nixon's I972 JU-suttc
landslide.

Unfortunately for them, that landslide hlld

to Watergate and the economy.

If more evidence is needed, just look In

He could hear the sound of the pany as he
walked up the stairs. It came to him as a
muffled roar, and the vibrations rocked his
feet. The young man was really high, and the
sounds felt so good. He walked right past the
girl at the door, not paying the one dollar en-
trance fee. He was invisible.

Inside, the room was dark. There were few
lights on. and they were all gloomy blue. All
the faces were white, washed of color. People
were moving in jerky, broken movements, to
the music of the band. The student wandered
through the crowd towards the bar. brushing
past people he wasn‘t sure he knew. He wanted
to be by himself tonight. He grabbed a beer
and walked away, not listeningto the bearded
bartender who called after him to pay ﬁfty
cents. There was no way to get at him anyway.
The crowd had grown. and just walking from
one side to another was difficult. The floor was
slippery,and hemadchisway carefully through
tltc people. not wanting to spill his beer. It was
important that he get to a corner where he
could stand and watch the faces go by.

He reached the corner and leaned against
the hard wall. From where he was the crowd
scented to be a single, growing organism. It
pulsed here. and retreated there. The only
thing he could compare it to was the amoeba
Itc had once seen in a biology movie. Mindless,
ycl alive. The people there all looked alike to
him. They wore faded jeans. flower print
shirts. work shoes. and red bondannas creep-
ing out of their back pockets. He. too. fit this
description, although his shirt was a pale, blue
workshirt, with white bleach spots. All the
girls lutd the same hairdo: long ilnd straight,
with at part in the middle. The guys had dark
curly hair in imitation of Afros. So did ltc.

l'hc band had just finished a songand they
announced it ten minute break. He could see
the disappointed look on many male faces.
l'hcy were hoping the band would continuc so
tltcy wouldn‘t have to talk to the girls they
wcrc with. The young man smiled at that. He
didn‘t have that problem. He wasn‘t talkiogto
ttnyhody. yet he was beginning to wish
dil'l'crcntly.

Across the room someone scented to be
heading towards hint. 'I’ltc approaching per-
son ttllcrntttcly disappeared and appeared as
Itcntutlchis way through the crowd. When he
wars halfway across, the student could make
otIt who it was. It was on old roommate of his.
'I'hcy \vcrcn‘t roommates anymore because
they had ceased communicating. Wllill had
hccn it real l'ricndship one September had
become by the next May a bare tolerance. The
two had never talked about ii and rctttincd ll
slight acquaintance now that they lived apart.

He was about three quarters of the way
ttcross the room now. and tire student could
see the olhcr‘s eyes. They were lit up with acid.
he was sure. He llitd been wondering why his
old roommate was coming over. The room-
mate reached the student and stood there for a

second, wavering slightly on his feet. The stu-
dent looked him over. He had cut his hair and
was wearing it without a part. Herseemed too
tall. and then the student looked down and
saw the polished brown shoes with a two-inch
sole and heel. They were new. His jeans were
blue and faded, yet there were no patches on
them. He wore a tee shirt emblazoned with the
red tongue and lips of the Rolling Stones.
There were black smudges under his eyes. and
his prominent nose cast a shadow on the left
side of his face. He was squinting against the
bright light on his right.

"Howyadoin'. Man. I feel really incredible
tonight, ya know. We dropped at about three
this afternoon, and got off at five or so. it's
really good. I been wantin to do some for a
long time. and now that I'm finished with all
my tests. . ." His voice trailed off and he seem»
cd to be thinkingabout something very impor-
tant. “Ya know, this acid is really clearin
things up inside. Like. we never talked about
why we stopped bcirt friends. ldon't know. It
just happened. I think we were intotoo many
differcttt things. I mean the only thing we had
to talk about was music, and gettin high." He
was speaking very rapidly. The words tumbled
out of his moutlt like foam spilling over the
side of a glass of warm beer. “Hey man. well.
look, I'm gonna go back to where I was before.
I‘ll see ya.’l'akcit easy.“ He turned around and
began walking off to the right. the crowd for-
cing him to change his direction. The student
followed his progress with his eyes until he
could no longer be seen.

His beer ﬁnished, the student began walking
towards the front of the room. so he would tut

 

 

a better view of the band. They were the best
group around. and he liked to just stand near
them, watch. and listen.

Hegently pushed his way to the front' of the
room and stood in front of the band: It was
loudest right there and maybe it would be too
loud to think. He hoped so. Hedidn't want to
think of the things that bothered him. This
girl: that course. This graduate school; that
exam. He knew that his problems were the
problems of a privileged person; they were
luxurious problems. Most people in the world
had to worry about simply surviving.
Somehow that made his problems no less real
and important.

The music began. It was loud and the sound
tilled him up. He closed his eyes and let it ﬂoat
around in his mind. It washed him. cleansed
him. left him pure and new. Around him peo-
ple were lookingat his shut eyes, slightly sway-
ing body. and shook their heads. He felt
better. ready to enjoy himself. His mind had
been washed clean of troubles for the moment.
It was time to loosen up the body. It was time
to dance.

He opened his eyes and began scanning the
room for someone who looked like she was
ready to dance. On his right. ten feet away.
was a girl who was bouncing up and down in
time to the music, not moving from one spot.
She was tall, about ﬁve feet ten. Her brown
hair was shiny and curled under her chin.
framing her oval face. Her skin looked
smooth, and her large brown eyes smiled. Her
legs were long and her waist was small. The
blue and white striped shin she wore clung
tightly. She was beautiful. He walked over to

her. “Yes. I'd like todaneefsheanswered. 
voice was soft. . j >

They walked onto the dance floor, she
leading. and stood near the band. 'i like the
music to be loud.” the said. The band began
playing. and the dance floor came alive. He

watched her dance. instead. of looking

elsewhere, as the others did. She waagraeeiul
and relaxed: no motion was wasted.

The music ended, but they stood there
together in the middle of the room, neither one
saying anything. but enjoying the moment.
They exchanged looks when the music started
up again. and began to dance. Ten minutes of
bouncing. twisting, spinning and dancing
litter. the song ended. Both were warin and
tired. “Let's get a beer,” she said. She took his
hand and led him through the crowd. After
they bought their beers. they walked outside
and sat down in the cool grass. “My name is
Evelyn.“

"I'm Adam."

"What a clear sky tonight. I can‘t believe
how many stars there are. Look!" She grabbed
his arm and pointed to the northern part ofthe
sky.

"’I‘here‘s Orion. It‘s my constellation. I
always look for it wherever lam. I‘ve always
thought that we were linked together
somehow. When I can't find it I feel lost. Do
you have a special star?“

“No.”

“What year are you in?" She kept his arm.

“I‘m a senior."

“What are you going to do next year?"

"That's a really good question. I don‘t
know. Maybe I‘ll go to grad school. but I‘m
not crazy about that. [‘4 ME to -travel',
maybe just around the country and take pic-
tures. but I don‘t have the money for it."

“That sounds fabulous. I wish I could do
something like that. but I can‘t."

“Why not?”

“I have to stay in school. or my parents
want pay for me. They said if I drop out for
even one semester they won‘t pay for me
anymore."

“That doesn‘t sound too cool.“

A silence fell, and they both sat in their own
worlds for a few minutes when she suddenly
spoke up.

" Do you want to go back insideand dance?"
"Sure." he answered. and they began to stand
up. He was on his knees, and she pushed his
shoulders, knocking him on his back. He
started laughing and grabbed her arm, dragg-
ing ltcr down next to him. She fell over on her
side. and they faced each other. He looked at
her. brushed away the hair which had fallen

warm and open. They stayed like that for a
long time. She broke away, and laughing

began jogging towards the door. He sat up ~

slowly and, slightly stunned, got up to follow

her.

Ilttck inside they walked into the now empty
party. The band was winding down the even-
ing with a slow, mournful song: Adam and
Evelyn put their arms around each other. and
slowly started tracing circles, ﬁgure eights.
and spirals on the iloor. There was no onenear
them. On the side a photographer took pic-
tures of them silhouetted against the band.
They were the only people dancing.-

“'l‘lIat's it for us tonight. Thanks a lot," said
the band's guitarist after the song. The lights
on stage went off, and the rest of the room lit
up. They both squinted in the sudden
brightness.

“Let's go over to my roortt and get high," she
said as she grabbed his hand again. He follow-
ed her out, not saying anything, his mind in II
happy. lusty swirl. He wasn‘t sure wltut was
going on; he only knew lie was ltavinga great
time.

The night was warm. She pttt herdbund in his
and led the way. They reached a small foot-
bridge rtnd stopped. Underneath them ran a
small brook. It gurgledns it mount! the sound
soothed. She turned and put her arms around
his neck. liis arms closed behind her waist.
Their eyes locked, then closed slowly. Ileneth
his eyelids unnameablc colors jumpe'd.
