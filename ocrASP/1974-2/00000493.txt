PianomShows Outstanding”.

hy Myron Ii. Brazin

If you've ever spent an extended
period of time in Albany. say four
years or so. and have not been to the
Recital Hall. you have missed
something. It was the scene of two
outstanding piano recitals this week.
On Tuesday night. Andrew Rangell.
a graduate student at the .lulliard
School. performed Beethoven‘s
Sonata in Rb and lves‘ F irrr Sonora.
Findlay Cockrell performed
Beethoven‘s Tempest Sonata and
other works last Wednesday and
Thursday afternoons.

Rangell's professional career
began only last March with a debut
in New York City. Considering his
limited concert experience. he was
quite impressive. His interpretations
of both works were rather unique.
Rangell's strongest points were dur-
ing the ragtime passages of the Ives
picec. He also paid more attention to
dynamics and other nuances. He
related the Beethoven and Ives
pieces. a difficult task considering
their vast differences.

From a musical point of view
Rangcll seemed to crossblend the
two vastly different styles. It
appeared that hewas a bit abrupt on
the Beethoven and somewhat lyrical
on the Ives. Usually it is the other
way around. As such. the approach
is valid in that he seemed to be up-
dating the traditional approach to
Beethoven. In a sense. this concert
underlies the trend of young
musicians to treat modern music
with the same wholchcartcd ap-
proach as other music. rather than

isolate it. apologire lor it. or

otherwise be wary of it.

Findlay Cockrell concluded his
"Second Wednesday and Thursday
at 4:00 Concerts" series this season
with a serious analysis of Sonata
Allegro form in the pieces that he
played. This series is highly com-
mendable because of the listening
and learning experience involved.
This program will be repeated on
Saturday. on November 23. and on
Sunday. November 24.

record review



Great cities are usually associated
with great rivers. Ro me‘s river was of
course the Tiber. often called by the
Romans the tawny (ﬂovur) Tiber.
because of its muddy appearance...
That appearance is the same today.
And associated with' rivers are
bridges. This article is a biography-—
highlights only—of one of the
bridges which spanned. and still
spans. the Tiber.

Known in antiquity as the Ports
“bridge” Mulvius or Milvius, the
bridge has managed to retain in only
slightly altered form its original
name; it is in Italian the Pun/e Mulls.
The Romans normally named their
bridges. as well as many of their
roads. after the official who let the
contract for their construction.

This man was frequently a well
known public figure with an in-
teresting history of his own. Bill in

nothing is known of him. Though

modern Rirnini. This bridge is
reputed to be the second Roman
bridge. following the old wooden

bridge. However. it seems probable
that there were other earlier bridges.
particularly to the Tiber island. and
that the first version of the Mulvian
itself may have been of wood.

In any case, it musthayc been in
existence in or before 220 B.C.. for
that was the year of the construction
of the Via FIuminia. Through the
centuries the Mulvian bridge has un-

New Riders Get Serious

by Laura E. Coleman

Since their appearance last year at
SU NYA. the'New Riders ofthc I’ur-
ple Sage have released two albums.
The first was a live album. and in-
eluded their now ex-bass player.
Dave 'l‘orbert. 'I‘hcir newest album.
lirujo, is the first with Skip Battin.
their new bass player.

This album shows a mellower side
of the Riders. Since their rowdy
I’mmnm Red album. they seemed to
have calmed down and taken their
music more seriously.

The new songs of John Dawson
are evidence of this. This mellower
trend in his compositions first began
to show tip on I’anunm Red in “One
Too Many Stories" and “You
Should Ilavc Seen MeRunnin." It is

continued onBrujo in “Old Man
Noll." and “Parson Brown". The
former of these songs proves Daw-
son‘s seriousness not only about
music. but about lyrics. as he seems
to go deeper into a serious topic than
he did on previous albums.

But despite his turn to more
thoughtful style. he still has retained
his ability to write a fun song. “Ins-
tant Armadillo Blues" isagood row—
dy country song. Inaddition to the
entry lyrics. inserted are little com-
ments to add to the tone ofthc song.
“an armadill's kinda like an armored
car except he's got feet instead."

Other songs on the album are
taken from such writers as Bob
Dylan. N RI’S gives an excellent ren-
dition of “You Angel You" by corn-
hining the Riders‘ spirit and yet leav-
ing the subtle Dylan style unchang-
ed.

Other composers sampled on [im-
jo are Troy Seals combining his
talents with those of Will Jennings
and Don Goodman for

“Workingman‘s Woman.“ and
Robert Hunter ofthc Grateful Dead
collaborating with David Nelson of
NRPS on “Crooked Judge."

Another combination is that of
Skip Battin. their new bass player
and Kim Fowley. Together they
provide music that gives the magic to
this album. Two of the songs they
contribute. “Neon Rose.“ and “On
the Amazon." are purely fun songs.
and their other two on the album are
superior country songs. These two
songs. “Big Wheels." and “Singing
Cowboy." are perfectly suited to the
New Riders‘ style. Battin‘s com-
positions. in addition to his bass
playing add to the Riders total image
of a great country rock band.

This album almost makes the
heights reached by Panama Red and
their first. NIt’l’S.

In looking at thisnlbum. Ican see
that despite the loss of Dave Torbert.
the Riders have ptillcd together. and
with the help of Skip Battin. have
produced a superiorcountry record.

recounts that. when the official an-
nouncement of the Toman victory
over Hasdrubal. brother of Han-
nibal. was expected. eager crowds
thronged the road all the way from
Rome to the Mulvian bridge. When
Cicero. at that time one of the two
chief Roman magistrates. wanted to
set a trap for the Catilinarian con-
spirators. he chose this spot to locate
an ambush. which captured both an
agent of the conspirators with a
message for their absent leader. and
envoys of the Allobroges. a Gallic
tribe. carrying letters designed to stir
up a rcvoltamongthat people. In an
address to the Roman people.
delivered the next day. Cicero gaveu
vivid account of the action at the
bridge.

By far the most famous event
which occurred at the Mulvian
bridge was the one involving Con-
stantine. By defeating Mnxentius in
the battle of the Mulvian bridge.
Constantine became sole emperor of
Rome. Just before this battle he saw
a vision: the sign of the cross with the
words: In line .rigno l'l’ll’t’: “In this
sign you will conquer." Thereafter.
from religious or political motives.
or a combination of both. Constan-
tine not only stopped the
persecutionsofChristians but also in
many ways lent support to the
church.

The Mulvian bridge features in
modern military activities also. In
Ilt49. while Garibaldi was defending
the city. the northem arch was blown
up. During World War II tther-
man army retreated from Rome by
way of this bridge; the allied armies
with their heavy equipment follow-
ed. Al'ter all. the Poor Mulvias had

"served us the principal "doorway" to

Rotne for approximately 2000 years.
