, Exciting Rematch,

by Jason “1‘ he Flying Rook" Braun
The following game was played at
the meeting of the SUNYA chess
club last Saturday. even though it
ended peacefully, the opening was
very tricky and led to a complicated
position. White had built up it nice
space advantage by the |5th move
but missed the best continuation that
would have given him the win. After
that. black played strongly to split
the point. it was an enjoyable game
to play and analyze, though some of
the best moves were never played.

South‘s leap to 3 Clubs is a bit

proceeded as follows. I'be l'irsl two

the key play of the hand comes
now. South must play a spade from
dumnty and trump it with the three.
South now plays two more rounds of
diamonds and tlten gives up his los-
ing heart. .
