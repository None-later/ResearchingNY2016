but slightly srrbdu'ed. after the three
hour show. The length of the show
was not the only reason for our
relaxation. The mellowness of the
music was very important in creating
our mood. The music was veryjazzy,
and Mahavishnu-like at points. “Ex-
pressway To Your Heart,” the se-
‘ cond song, was the introduction to
the jazz liavbr of the night. it was
done instrumentaliy, and almost too
changed to recognize. The ﬁrst song
was more in accordance with the
wishes of the crowd. It was a Chuck
Berry tune, called “Let It Rock,"

from Garcia's most recent solo -

album. From the reaction of the
crowd it was evident that they were
hoping fora Grateful Dead dance

Either these people came expec-
ting a Grateful Dead concert.’ or
hoped that SauMeanarcia would
incorporate a few Dead songs in the
show. If this was the case they would
have been better off staying at home
and putting on Europe '72, because
they couldn't have been more mis-
taken. The only similarities between
the two bands are their tightness.
Garcia and Friends
played a combination of funkyjazz,
slowly paced Dylan, and rhythm &
blues. The essential part of their
music is that it is not classiﬁable.
When you have five competent
musicians with boundless musical
interests, is single concert could not
be expected to'present only one type
of music.

Garica's vocals always sent a rush
through the crowd, but they were ob-
viously secondary to the music. The
many instrumentals showed that.
Thiswas where the band (through no
fault of theirown) may have failed to

They exhibited the power of a

across as ‘a punch in the jaw. They
were a steady rainfall rather than a

to their effect were the two Bob

from Planet Waves. and were even
more relaxed than Dylan'siatest
style.'.“Going Going Gone," was in
the ﬁrst set, and “Tough Mama“ in
the second. both of which were one
and one-half hours long..
Saunders played three mean
keyboards: piano, organ, and syn-
thesizér. He was most at home on the
organ. which he played most of the
night. His runs were ﬁlled with high
chords and bigsmilcs, as he obvious-
ly enjoyed playing. Garcia played his
usual invent iveguitar, his notes ring-
ing clear from the excellent sound
system. He didn‘t play any wuh-wah

 

because that belonged to Martin"
Fierro who played reeds. Fierro is a_
sought after studio musician who is-

just getting onstage. For us it is hard
to dispel the thought of Garcia and
Saunders, but Fierro’s electric sax-
ophones and flute lured our interest.

Even good bass players and
'drummers rarely draw anyone‘s
attention, but it was evident that
John Kahn on bass, and Paul
Humphrey on drums were there for
more than just the beat. Garcia look-
ed towards both of them when begin-
ning jams. They were strre of where
he was going, giving the impression
they were more thanjust competent.

Lewis London will return to the
SUNYA stage tonight and Saturday
in the Campus Center Assembly
Hall. London‘s last appearance here
was with a band called the Bottichill
Boys. However, Lew struck out on
his own not too long ago, and now
has an act called Lewis London at a].
This group, consisting of Lew and
two backup men (on mandolin,
guitar, bass, ete.),-is a versatile one.
Their style ranges from Jazz a la
Django Reinhart to Country Swing
(acoustic music done in a jazz-type
style).

Lewis London‘s musicianship can
be summed up in one word: superb.
in addition to being able to play
practically any stringed instrument
with phenomenal talent. London is
also noted for his talent as a vocalist.
His repertoire includes many songs
by contemporary writers such as
Patti Siehel and Dave Bromberg.

 

 

Instead of standing on a highway, catching

you could be catching our car: Amtrak may not
be as cheap as hitching. But for the little
money you spend, you get a lot more in retum.

Nowhere else but on an Amtrak train do
you get so much room along the way.

We give you the biggest seat in travel. With
more space around it, too.

From our picture windows, we give you
the kind of close—up view of America you
can’t get from highways and cloudbanks.

You can get a different point of view,
too, from the people you meet
on the train. Since there are no seat belts
to hold you back on Amtrak.
you can roam the train from car to car.
Maybe grab something to drink '

The world famous Preservation
Hall Jazz Band will appear here in a
concert Saturday.

The band is on tour from its home
in legendary New Orleans where the
members of the group all took part
in the birth of our most American art
form.

Each of the members of the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band has
memories of the days when jazz.
“jass” as they spelled it at the turn of
the centurypwas taking form and
shape and becoming a separate kind
ofmusic. They were in the bands that
marched to and from the cemetery
for funerals, they were in thewagons
that drove up and down French
Quarter streets and battled it out
when two bands met at a corner.
They were on the river boats, in the
saloons and ‘sporting houses‘ and
dances. In fact, they were the people
who added their names to Freddy
Keppard. Buddy Bolden. Louis
Armstrong, King Olivur and Jelly
Roll Morton in the exciting history
of an American art form that grew
from many sources in the special
culture that was New Orleans.

These are the people who made
the history. But their vitality and
youthful drive is still apparent in the
singing, happy music of New
Orleans and a concert today is full of
the same spirit that madejazz the un-
inhibited music ofthe period around
the first world war.

People from all over the world
have made Preservation Hall at 736

They know the music best. and they

Out of thechoking smog of navy
metal rock, SUNYA presents a
clean. flowing breath of fresh air—
The Eleventh House. with Larry
Coryell, and Michael Urbaniak‘s
Fusion. tonight.

Urbaniak, a Polish violinist-
saxophonist, is backed by a very
competent group. and accompanied
by the brilliant Vocals of his wife,
Urszula Dudziak. His highly in-
novative music is neither pure jazz
nor pure rock, but is, as the name
suggests, is a fusion ofthe two. He’s
been rising extremely fast in the
States and is bound to be an ex-
cellent opening act for tonight‘s con-
cert.

The Eleventh House has been
bringing down concert houses all
overthecountry,and has beendraw-
ing rave reviews ever since they
began touring in April. The
Eleventh House consists of, on
drums, Alphonse Mouzon. power-
fully cxcellent. and late of Weather
Report. Danny Trifan on bass. isa
versatile musician, who formerly
played wrth Buzzy Linhart. Mike
Mandel, an absolute genius on
keyboard! and synthesizer, has been
playing intermittently with Coryell
for years, butnow, with the Eleventh
House, he is a permanent fixture.
Mike Lawrence plays tmmpet. ﬁll-
ing the void left by Randy Brecker
(who went to join Billy Cobham's

band after cutting the Eleventh

Michal Urbanialt's Fusion.

EleoenthHo‘use

House album) and adding newr' ’

dimensions of his own; and guitar,
Larry Coryell—yes. the Larry Cor-
yeli, the guitarist's guitarist.

Coryell is the main attraction of
the night. _‘ producer of a highly
ﬂammable mixture of the lucidity of
a jazzman, the conscientiousness of a
classical guitarist, and the high-
powered emotionalism of a rock
musician, all ignited by the spark of
spontaneity.

He has been very strongly in-
fluenced by Jimi Hendrix, and has
learned to incorporate the heavy tex-
tural effects of rock into his music,
resulting in the jazz/rock that is be-
ing called the "new music.“

Unlike early Coryell. however,
The Eleventh House is a group. and
Coryell's guitar is an integral part of
the music—not the virtuoso
backbone it was in previous groups.

“i am really concentrating more
on being part ofa total sound rather
than being a vituoso. The Eleventh
House is it. The name Larry Coryell
is really secondary to the totality of
it. Speaking from ego standpoint, I
certainly wouldn't mind if it were
dropped...lt would be nice if
everybody‘s names were listed at all
times. That would be more equitable
and more and more realistic," says
Coryell.

All the signs point towards agreat
concert, and perhaps after .o‘ilghi
they will be thought of as not Cor-
yell‘s band, but simply as the
Eleventh House.
