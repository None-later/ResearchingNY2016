Agricultural Districts:
Towards Comprehensive
Land-Use Planning

by Lawrence Pohl

One of the most pressing needs in New York
State and throughoutthe country is the need
for some sort of comprehensive land-use plan-v
ning. Many personsare unaware that land-use
planning is not necessarily a one-shot deal. In
fact. while'no ofﬁcial statewide plan exists. the
State has been accummulating several
regional studies and thus is incrementally ap-
proaching similargoals as any comprehensive
land-use program. Among these regional
commissions are the Hudson River Valley
Authcirity', the Adirondack Park Agency. the
Catskill Commission, the Tug Hill Commis-
sion and other regionally sponsored land-use
studies such as the Eastern-Ontario-St.
Lawrence report.

In addition to these regional commissions
there exists a state law encouraging the protec-
tion and preservation of rural farmlands. The
Agricultural Districts Law, theofﬁciat title for
this program, recognizes the important role
played by agriculture in the State. A majority
of urbanized New Yorkers fail to recognize
thatSpe-sixth of all of New York's land area

can be classiﬁed as prime agricultural. In I973
farmers produced SL3 billion worth of
products. Various urban pressures have put
tremendous strain on existing rural lands. to
the point where in I973 we had only 56,000
farms. while in I949 we had over 125.000. An

out of cultivation yearly.

By law, each agricultural district encom-
passes a minimum of 500 acres. Since New.
York's ﬁrst agricultural district was created in
May I97l. I35 additional districts have been
formed with another 35 under review. In total
land area the districts encompass ap-
proximately two million acres on over 6,000
farms — nearly two-fifths of New York‘s best
agricultural land.

The agricultural district approach is part of
this incremental crawl towards much needed
comprehensive land-use planning. For a free
informational booklet write to Hank Steb-
bins, NYS Dept. of Environmental Conserva-
tion, 50 WoIfRd. Rm. 414, Albany, New York

aware that the plot thins out around the letter
‘P'. And where Noah does bring up some in-
teresting subjects, I ﬁnd he just doesn‘t go deep
enough. To say that “sesquapadalianism is a
big word” just isn't enough for me.

A LBANIAN-ALBINO AMERICAN
HISTORY

3 CREDITS. Explores and analyzes the tragic
situation of the Albanian Albino and his
plight. Not a mere pigment of the imagination,
the troubles surrounding our most forgotten
minority are-in dire need of being brought'out
into the sunlight. But not for too long.

CREATIVE CALCULUS
4 CREDITS. It has long been argued that the
Mathematics Department has been stiﬂing
the creative spirit of the students. With this
new course, the department hopes to put an
end to the criticism. Beginning with the basics.
the student is invited to ﬁnd his own solutions
to classic math problems. Professor U. Clidian
explains. “We want to help the students grow.
“If a student feels that he does not want3 X 4
to equal I2, but instead wants it to equal I9, we
feel we should respect that point of view. The
class is in the Social Sciences Building and
meets from 2:00 to 3:00 two times a week.
making for a total of I3 class hours weekly. or
something like that.“

TERMPAPER PREPARATION

3 CREDITS. The course explores the ﬁner
particulars of term papers: where to buy them,
how to modify them to yourparticular assign-
ment, etc. Projects will include comparison of
different firms' products, and reports on term-
paper production. Tlte reports wiltbe verbal.

MEN'S LIBERATION

Amuch requested course, it will focus on the
often neglected contributions that males have
made to our civilization throughout history.
Projects will include interviews with male
truckdrivers, male lumberjacks, male jockeys,
etc. Professor Mathew Kismoh is enthusiastic
about the course: “It‘ll really open their eyes.
So few people really knowabout the actions of

'males throughout the centuries. For instance.

did you know that the light bulb was invented
by a man? So was the ﬁrst laser. It‘s amazing,
when you stop to think about it . . . “

THEORY OF THEORY THEORIZING

A required course here at SUNYA. It tries to
explain how a university can get by with
courses that are of absolutely no use to the
students. Attempts will be made to account for
many of the students who leave Albany un-v
able to function in the real world. A prere—
quisite for any SUNYA course, such as theory
of typewriting, theory of swimming, etc., the
course will require a lot of work. none of it of
any purpose in the real world.

APATHY WORKSHOP

Tests optional. Papers optional. Attendance
optional. Matter of fact, they may not hold the
course.

So, you see. registration doesn't have to be a
hassle. ltdocsn‘t have to hcdifﬁcult. In fact, it
doesn't even have to be. Drop out, get ajob,
and stop sponging off your parents, you no

Editor's Note: Due to an unintentional jux-
tapositioning of paragraphs in last week's
Castles Burning, part of it might not have
made sense. It was a typographical error. This
week, however, Ken has no excuse if it doesn‘t
make sense.
