by Les Zuelrennan

Albany State football has been
ranked seventh in the final Lambert
Bowl standings. Only three of the six
teams ahead of them have unbeaten
records.

The dream of a perfect season
began with successive wins over
Alfred and Hofstra. After victories
against Nichols and Carry. the illu-
sion was placed into the realm of
possibility.

Tomorrow at 1 pm. R.P.l. will be
the final obstacle for an Albany
State team that seeks perfection. The
game will be played at University
Field.

Last Saturday. the Danes easily
defeated Plattsburgh by the score of
49-8. Albany State was held to four-
teen points in the first half. but then
exploded in the final thirty minutes.

The Dane defense was outstan-
ding against Plattsburgh. The Car-
dinal running game was completely
dissolved. Albany's r pass defense
had a fine day with five intercep-
tions.

The Danes performance against
I’Iattsburgh is an important factorin
tomorrow‘s game with R.P.I. The
Engineers have a pass-oriented
offense that has been plagued all
season by frequent interceptions.

R.l’.l. used two quarterbacks
throughout the game situation.
Freshman Dave Coons started last
week against Trinity College. He
threw five interceptions. before be-
ing replaced by Senior Jon Nystrom.
The problem was not remedied by
Nystrom, as he threw two intercep-
tions as well.

Drive Coons is the best passer on
the R.l’.l. squad. If he is given
protection, he can hit his receivers
with consistency. However. he has

the tendency to throw the ball into a
crowd. if under pressure. This season
has found that most of Coon's losses
have foundtheir way into the hands
of the opposition.

Albany will try to put a strong
pass rush on Coons to force him to
put the ball up for grabs. The Dane
secondary will arrange their
coverage to be in position to pick up
the interception.

R.P.I. has a fine ﬂanker in Pete
Kettering. who leads the team in
receptions. He has good hands and
speed. but his biggest asset is his
ability to run evasive patterns.

The Engineer running attack is
centered upon half-back Aaron
Anzelc. His talent is overshadowed

,by an excellent offensive line than is
capable of opening holes in any op-
posing defensive line.

The R.I’.I. offensive line combina-
tion of Stcvc.Connors at guard and
Bill Kahl at tackle is highly respected
by Dane Coach Bob Ford. “Both
men are great blockers and have the
size and strength to execute their
assignments“. At center. Stoyan
Lokar is agood complement to Con-
ners and Kahl.

On defense, the Engineers are lead
by Captain Tom Russell at defensive
tackle. Russell is 5'I0". 230 pounds.
He is a very dedicated ballplayer
with all the necessary physicalskills.

The star of the R.l’.l. defense is
middle guard Mike Carbone. The
Dane scouts call him “super
aggressive with a great nose for the
football". R.P.I.‘s defense is the
strong-point of the squad. mainly
due to Crlrhone and Russell.

In the secondary. R.P.l. has two
fine athletes in Vince Ricciardi and
Ron Page. Iloth men are expected to
play wide receiver tomorrow as well

 

as defensive back. This is part of the
Engineer strategy to stress the pass-
ing game. Ricciardi and Pageare ex-
tremely fast and will try to break the
Dane zone along with Kettering at

ﬂanker.

Ricciardi is the best athlete on the
R.P.I. team. He leads the team in in-
terceptions with eight. He reads the
run exceptionally well and will not

give up the long puss. Playing both

offense and defense will hurt his

effectiveness.

The Engineers linebackers are
tough on defending the run but will
be having problems dropping back
to cover the pass. .The Danes will
utilize this factor to concentrate on
passes over the middle and in the
ﬂats.

The Dane game plan is to shut off
the running attack of RH and force
them to pass. Then the Albany
secondary can concentrate on pass
coverage formations. R.P.I. isaware
of the fact that their running game is
poor except for Anzelc. They are
keeping no secrets that they are go-
ing to throw the ball all day.

Tomorrow‘s game will mark the
last performance ofsevcn veterans of
the Albany State varsity program.
They are: Jim Holloway. Rudy
Vido. Mike Basia. Don Mion. Dom
l’agano. 'l'im Myers. and Teddy
Robinson. These seniors will be
given plenty of playing time
tomorrow by Coach Ford.

The Albany Strife offense under
the direction of John Ilertuzzi
should have little trouble tomorrow
with the R.P.I. defense. John is an
excellent play calleriind excels under
pressure.

llertuui can he expected to give
the ball to Tom Delllois a great deal
tomorrow. The Danes will be trying
to go against the strength of R. I’.l.—-
that being Mike Curbonc. If Car-
bouc is unable to liandfc Delilois in-
side. then llcrtuIJi will be ubleto mix
the short passes with the rtin. The
result being that the R.l‘.l. defense
will suffer and may prove incapable
of rccstablishling itself against the
Danes.

Harriers

A long. long season is finally
drawing to ri close for the Albany
State Cross-Country team. as they
concluded their dual riieet schedule
Tuesday afternoon here oti their
home coursc. It was a happy ending
for the barriers. too. as they linislicd
on a solid note. by soundly downing
Union College l5-4h.

The running looked good on
Tuesday, althouin Union was ex-
peclctl to offer little rcseisttuicc.
which they did. Despite cliilly.drimp
conditions. with wet grounds, the
varsity made it It clean sweep of the
first five places.

The big three. consisting of Vinny
Roda. Chris Burns and (.‘trrlo
Cherubino mrrde it in as a unit all
running the 5.0 mile course in
2mm. Ii‘ourth place was held down
by StJNYA's Ilriau Davis with ti
20:41 and fifth position was grabbed

The Dance In theft game against Brockport. Above: Albany's defense

Close With a Win

by Gary Furlong. 27:06.4. Union's [-
2 runners. Roy Wriudelniuicr and
Stan Wiskowski, came in tub and 7th
respectively at 27:42 rind 27:53.

One poiirt that should be meri-
tioircd is a word of thanks to the Uri-
ion Athletic |)epurtiiicut and the
cross-country coilcli. The meet with
Albany was originally scheduled for
the previous Tuesday. Due to a
change in the date of the Nationals.
Illiioll kindlyugreed to postpone our
meet. thus rillowuig the Albany
runners to rest.

Season Ends

With the completion of the dual
meet season, the l974 cross-country
team can look back with pride in the
new win record they set this full.
Albany finished with nuoutsiiiudillg
12--l slate in dtull competition.

Suid (Touch liob Munscy. “I'm
kinda tickled about that itdid give us
it new record in the urea of'dtlilluiect

wins. The chances are that we will
not really get twelve again."

The reason for this is in the lip-
coniingyearthe sclicdulcis beingcut
back a little by ConchMuiiscy. The
motivation behind this move is ilic
idea of trying to get a little more rest.
Ily cutting back on the number of
running dates. the possibility of iin
extra long season, such as this past
one. is eliminated. illid hopefully
bellcr pcrforrnnncc at each mcct will
develop.

“The teams we've dropped lire
kind of the automatic win variety."
mentioned Muriscy. “so the record
might not be its good bill I think it‘ll
be better for us."

l(' As

The last bridge the varsity iriiist
cross before they call it a season is
the l('AAAA (.‘liiirnpioirships on
Monday in Van (.‘ortliuid Park. New

Three and a half months ago a
perfect season was the goal set by
SUNYA football coach Bob Ford.
,Nine games later it became reality. as
’IAibtlny defeated R P] 37-7 Saturday
to complete a 9-0 season.

and jumped on one another. Their
goal was reached. and these men
were here to celebrate. The center of
attraction was their leader. Couch
Ford. doused with a bottle of chum—
pagne. The team had another reason
to celebrate. as fullback Tommy
Delllois reached the magic
thousand-yard mark on the first play
of the season.

The Dunes almost didn't have a
chance to celebrate. us they had a
great deal of trouble with RP].
Albany obviously had underrated
the Engineers. But Rl’l came to play
and with a couple of breaks could
have beaten the Danes.

cond half that saved the day. With

Finally an Albany drive from RPl‘s

successful, as Marvin Perry went

the Danes a I'I-O lead at halftime.

The third quarter is supposed to
be the Danes‘big scoring quarter but
RI’I dominated that quarter Satur-

the ball they scored, via a sixty-one

The Dancs came right back as they

Grievance Procedure Debated
By Arts And Sciences Council

by Stephen n‘lillullitﬂ

A grievance proccdurc which has
ficcn established for undergraduate
and graduate students in the College
of Arts and Sciences will he the sub-
|ccl of debate III the Arts aritl
Sciciiccs ('ouncil this week. The
Council will be discussing whether
or not to abolish the procedure.

Ilaliiiy Kupluii. a Council
member. indicated that few students
blue thus for made use of this scl‘v
\icc. possibly because they don't
rculi/c that it exists.

Kitpluli pointed tllll, “liven if it is
not used this sort of procedure

It‘s a good idea to let the professors
know that they can be kept in
check."

lhc motivation for debuting tfic
issue partially stems froui the ques-
tion of necessity.

Knplun also feels lillll within the
Council there is considerable belief
that this sort of action should be
tnkcli through an off-cullipus group.
"lhc luciilty titres not want to be
placed iii the position of judging
ilicri fellow workers." commented
Kupfnn.

Kiiplundocs not liclicvclliait this is
a noble solution. Ilc doesn‘t tliuik
that outside orguui/utroiis should
have to bc invohcd with such llii-
ivcrsity problems. In addition. he
fecls lliut it great many of the
problems could be taken curc of
better on a small scale rather than
having to "goiilf tiic way to tire trip."

According to an outline released
by the Arts ulid Scicnccs L'ouiicil tlic
procedure is designed to urd
students “who seek adjudication of a
gi'iciuncc-cluim rcgurdiug the
academic performance of teaching
luculty ill the College of Arts ulitl

If the occusititi arises where it stit-
dcnt has assessed the rlcudcrnic pet'-
f'or'iiiilncc of a faculty member as
reasonable grounds for grievance ac-
tion he should first discuss the issue
with the faculty member involved in
tip effort to come to II satisfactory
resolution of the problem.

If such action fails to alleviate the
problem. tlle riiritter can be taken up
with the department chairperson of
the faculty against whom the
grievance-claim is made.

Should the student feel that the
problem has still not been solved he
may petition the CAS Executive
Committee for ii (ir'icvrmcc Corri-
nlittec llcrrring iuid Finding.

the Grievance procedure entails

iiiuliy clauses and can be confusing

such as the Physics Society. Students
