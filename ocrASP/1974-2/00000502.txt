The Directory. will also include
background information on thedoc-

attended. where they are presently
working. and medical societies that-
they belongto. Doctors willbeasked
whether they are internists or general
practitioners. They will also be asked
to quote their fees. '

questionnaires by mail so that the
questionnaires can be veriﬁed over
the phone. Towards mid-December.
the final typing of the list will be
done. There are ll people on the
committee including Coordinator
Karen Sullivan and Co-Coordinator
Adrienne Zuckerberg.

SUMA‘s list will bedone in prose
style, unlike an earlier report done in
Queens, which was in columnar
form. SUNYA's report will probably
include a lot more information
because Albany has fewer doctors
than does Queens.

Similar studies are being done at -

RPI and in Saratoga.
