“And what rough beast its hour '

come round at last,
Slouches towards Manhattan to be
born?”

astardizing Yeats? Sure! But
B applicable to this weekend
since, from all over the
country thousands of rough beasts
slouched towards the Commodore
Hotel on 42nd Street and Lexington
Avenue in New York City to attend
"First Famous Monsters Convention."
Boys and girls of all ages, with faces

 

flushed and eyes glowing, waited on_

extended lines to participate in the
long-awaited event. They were in a
state of bliss. . . . the type of bliss
which can be brought about only by
being scared half to death.

Inside they were met by rough-hewn

make-up jobs and rubber masks and
capes. iAbOUl the plush decor of the
high-class hotel walked creatures
with square heads, hunchbacks, and
gouged eye-balls. On the walls hung
movie posters and stills of
Frankenstein, Wolf-man, The Creature
from the Black Lagoon, and other
famous fiends of
fright.
, The throng was
herded into the
hotel‘s Gra nd ‘
Ballroom, by un- "
believing atten- 1:
dants, where they 1_
anxiously awaited u
the arrival of their
Mentor, the man y'
who has made a
profession out of be-
ing a fan, Forrest l.
Ackerman.

Ackerman, 54, is
hardly represen-
tative of his profes-
sion. He is a conser-
vatively dressed, approachable,
friendly man with glasses, a thin
moustache and an extremely warm
disposition. The publication he edits,
Famous Monsters 0/ Filmland, has
graced the newsstands for 17 years.
Ackerman started it in 1957 when he
interested James Warren in putting out
a horror~science magazine, The
magazine blossomed into what today is
one of the most popular genre
publications in existence. FM caters to
pre-adolescent audiences and can be
recognized by its devotion to early
horror and sci—fi, and its
unpretentious editorial quality (the
magazine‘s puns are as horrible as its

apparently loving it. Receiving over
500 letters a month, ACkel'man reads
each one. Several yearsago he and his
wife compiled a list of those writing fan
letters and drove cross~country to visit
as many as possible.

. Moving out into the lobby, one could
see a number of exhibits which had
been set up. A show of original art work
from the covers of FM dating back to its
inception, a representative from the
Aurora Company demonstrating
creative ways to make a plastic model,
FM photographer, Walt Dougherty,
and a collection of photos showing the
well-known monsters he has worked
with. There was also a room featuring a
sale of Warren publications; FM and
the newer Creepy, Eerie, Vampire/la
and Spirit, along with masks, films
models, make-up and anything else a
young creature-freak could desire.

Then, of course, there were the
inevitable comic
sellers who haunt
every convention
whether it be for
Science Fiction,
Sta r Trek 0 r
whatever. Dozens of
tables displaying
h u n d r e d s o f
thousands of com-
ics, as well as movie
stills, memorabilia.
posters. One could
meander for hours,
watching the movie
. trailers flashing on
the wall, the original
Doc Savage pulps
(average price,
$25.00 each), under-the—table sales of
photos of famous actors and actresses
of the thirties and forties in poses that
would make Linda Lovelace blush.

Some hints; Spiderman #1, in mint
condition, is $40.00 Fantastic Four,
$70.00; Wonder Woman, $100.00;
though Superman #1 is suggested to
be retailed at $1,200.00, one of its few
owners turned down an offer of
$5,000.00 at the lastauction. Chances
are, if you need a particular comic or
magazine you can get ithere . . . if you
can pay the price.

I asked Mr. Ackerman what he
thought of it and he smiled and stated
that when he attended the first Science

 

Miniature :

Commodore

Fiction Convention (Chicago, 1939),
an original cover painting from one of
the pulps of the period would run for

$10.00; today it could easily go for

$100.00. "Today. it you want to see a
horror movie," he said, "you just turn
on the TV . . . Young people today just
don‘t understand what it was like to be
growing up in the twenties and thirties
when these great films were coming
out one ata time. If you were a fan, you
were just isolated.'_'

Back in the Ballroom, aseries of
lectures and shows were going on;
Barry Alan Richmond director of the
Grand Guignol Theatre in Paris was
giving away some trade secrets on
how to make theatrical murder and

for the audience,
etc), Sam Sherman,
producerof Brain of
Blood, _ The
Creature'sRevenge
and Frankenstein
versus Dracula, was
telling kids "how to
make a monster
movie for fun and
profit",and theWest
Ballroom was hav-
ing a trivia contest. 

Ackerman was in 6
the Main Ballroom
again giving a slide-show of his large
home in Hollywood, a converted
Spanish Mansion, which is now a
private museum filled with priceless
relics of the Fantasy Film World.
Among his possessions are one of the
actual animation dolls used to
represent King Kong, Bela Lugosi’s
original Dracula ring, and, one of his
favorites, a small Model of uUltima
Fulum Automaton“ (the Metropolis
lfUl)Olt‘iX, which was played by
Bridgette Helm in 1926.).

Why Monster's? Why Science
Fiction? Why concentrate such
enormous energy on a fare which
scours pure escapist and opheriierril?

"in the first sovon decades of filmic
history," replied [\okerrnriri, "about
20,000 fantasy films have been
made . . . I got turned on to fantasy (if

thoughts turn to playboy, marriage, to
careers. What do they think about in
the interim? MONSTERS, that’s whatl
The success of FM seems to bear this
out.

Back in the Ballroom, Phil Seuling,

the Convention‘s sponsor goes to the
podium and announces that there will
be a contest to see who can make the
ugliest face. Contestants charge up en
masse and follow Phil into the next
room. In the meantime, Verne
Langdon, famed Hollywood make-up
man comes up to the stage with
assistants and cosmetic cases: he is
going to turn three volunteers from the
audience into REAL MONSTERS.
Hands shoot up, the
fortunate are
chosen, then led to
the stage. They are
ecstatic.
Many of the con-
ventioneers have
travelled far to at-
tend the event and
they are well
provided for—the
/ Hotel has granted
special rates for
them and movies
are going to be
shown every night
from 6 pm. to 3 am.
The show will con-
tain such greats as
Phantom ol the Opera, Bride of
Frankenstein, The Mummy, Island of
Lost Souls and many, many more.

Ackerman is concerned about the

lack of seriousness in modern fantasy
films which seem to sacrifice plot and
character development to gore. "If I
had a choice of picking the bestyears
of fantasy, it would be sixteen years,
from 1923 to 1936 . . . with 1931 as a
banner year since that was the one we
got both Karloff and Lugosi." But a bit of
enthusiasm comes into his voice as he
considers the popular success of 200]:
A Space Odyssey; "NOT SINCE
Metropolis has one film gained such
religious fen/or and fanatic devotion."
He concluded with the hope of living
through anotherGolden Age: "1 would
like to see an increase in the quality of
lire science fiction film from now to
the '21rit century . ..
This can be done by keeping one eye
on the past and one eye on the future."
Grinning liendishly, he adds: “Maybe
it would be better if you had three is
intelligence, Imagination. and
integrity."
