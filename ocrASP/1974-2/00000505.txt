sailed through the sky in a ti:in silver,-
single-engined plane. Two beginner
jumpers (Spence Reggie, and Carol
Mangiero), a jumpmaster, and myself
were all kneeling'o'n the floor, and the
pilot satin the only seat. We all gazed in
aweout the window at the mountains
andiiyalleys painted with fall colors.
The reds and yellows shone against the
bright azure of the sky. Maybe it was
this dazzling array of beauty that
suppressed the nervousness people
jumping for the first time would be
expected to have. Thrills ran through

excitement and

.I proceeded by a series of
zanddiscussions to prepare

sans the jumpers as'towha't they
swerein r. The lesson given to our

' advanturous heroes on’the day of their

'lump' concerned the folding and
packing (alsocalled rigging) of the
chute.

. This? is a long, exhausting process

' which takes approximately 30 minutes

- (more ‘ or less, depending on

experience). It must be done slowly
and accurately and under the
supervision of a licenced rigger. Our
heroes and myself got several hours of
practice in this area since there were
so. many chutes to be folded. In one
case, the previous jumper had
apparently landed in a thistle patch,
and we had to pick hundreds of little
thistles out of the canape. In another
case, we spent 30 minutes untangling
snarled lines. One packer told us of a
case in which it took four hours to
untanglea severely tangled chute.

It is the standard policy for all
jumpers to pack their own chutes.
Reserve chutes can only be packed by
a licenced rigger, and are then sealed

' and dated. If they are not used,~they
can be‘passed on for up to six months.
They must be repacked afterthistime.

A carelessly packed main chute can
have several possible results. In some
cases the line rubs against the canape
as it is being pulled outof the pack. The
opening of a parachute takes
approximately three seconds. The
tremendous friction from this speed
can cause the line to burn small holes
in the canape. This results in a slightly
harder landing for the jumper,
however the holes should be repaired
immediately thereafter. Another“
possible fault is when one of the lines
crosses over the wrong side of the
chute causing it to form two smaller

canapes. This is commonly known as a

“Mae West” and results in a harder

landing.

and he'was happily ﬂoating through

For the most part, all went well with
our two‘heroes at this time. I got a good
look at“ Spence’s face just as he jumped
backwards and’as the chute opened
from my little observation window on
the plane. I'm sure that that expression
could never be repeated. It was a look
of ecstasy, probably mixed with a bit of
fear, but not as much as I would have
expected. Spence told me later that the
only time he actually experienced fear
was when the door was first opened.
Although he had been told that it was
windy, he did not expect this
tremendous pressure. He said that he
had trouble holding on to the strut, and
that at the point where he was
supposed to jump back, all he had to
do was let go, and he was thrown back.
He described the trip down as "very

knew what was happening". carol,
due to her excitement, jumped before
the jumpmaster gave the order, which
landed her a little bit off of the target.
The jumpmaster told me that she had
thought that she heard the order to
jump, but it was kind of hard to hear
due to the wind and the helmet. That is
why the jumpmaster slaps the jumper
on the thigh as well as makes thecall.
While sailing downward, the jumper
has a forward speed of about nine
m.p.h. This can be used for slowing
down when facing into the wind, and
speeding up, by sailing with the wind.
Steering is done with two steer lines
called "toggles". These lines are
attached to flaps in the Chute, and act
as ruders. lust before landing, the
jumper wishes to reduce his speed to a
minimum. This can be done by facing

drastic occurs, a reserve chute is worn
in the front of the body. It has a ripcord
which the jumper can pull causing it to
fall into his lap (a reserve chute has no
pilot chute). He must then throw it out
in front of him so that it catches the
wind and opens. There is also a
mechanism attached that sets off a
charge of gunpowder, opening the
reserve chute, if the jumper is traveling
rapidly and at a too low altitude.

I Beginner jumpers do not use
npoords on their main chutes. A heavy
piece 01 nylon rope called a "static
line is fastened at one end to the
chute, and to the plane at the other.
When the jumper jumps, the static line
automatically pulls the parachute out
of its pack and the wind causes it to
open. Beginners are given a dummy
ripcord which serves no purpose
besrdes getting the jumper into the
habit of pulling it. Those beginners
who make five successful jumps witha
static line and three consecutive
successful dummy ripchord pulls are
allowed to jump free-fall.

There were several safety
precautions taken before take-off in the
plane. Iumpers wear a full jumpsuit
and a helmet. They enter the plane in
the opposite order in which they plan
to embark. The jumpmaster sits next to
the door to assist each of the jumpers

Climbing over one another can result

the chute opening in the plane. If this

chute catches the wind and goes out of

the plane, it can drag the plane down.

This is also the reason why jumpers
can often be seen with their hands
covering the ripchord. ,

One of the questions that entered my
mind several timesduring the daywas,
“Why do SUNYA students jump in the
first place?” 1 base my conclusion on
some statistics given to-me by Ken
Ryan, one of the instnictors at the
airport. He told me that 90% of the
students who jump the first time will
never do it again. Of the remaining
10%, only 2% evertry the free-fall. This
indicates that many students seek a
sudden thrill, and the ability to say that
they have tried skydiving.

into the wind, to slow forward speed,
and by pulling both toggles
simultaneously the moment before
touchdown.

Not all landings are soft and in a
level field. The evening before 1 was
there, Debbie Shepard, another
SUNYA student, landed in a tree and
spent a half hour getting herself out.
Carol landed between some trees, and
Spence landed in the brush.
Occasionally, a jumper injures a leg or
ankle in the landing due to a hard
landing or from landing on extremely
uneven ground. There is a tradition
among the members of the club and
the trainers and airport personnel, that
the first time someone pulls thier
reserve, looses their ripcord, lands in a
tree or lake, or does anything else
unusual, that person buys a case of
beer for the group.

After observing Carol and Spence
land from the plane we went back to
the airport and ldrove to the jumpsite.
There was a truck there from the
airport where the chutes, helmets, and
jumpsuits were collected, and there

was an instructor with a megaphone,
instructing jumpers in their
landings. When I arrived, Carol was
already walking through the alfalfa
field towards the truck with her
parachute in hand, along with some
other people who had assisted her in
unhamesaing herself, and folding her
canape, the nylon part of the
parachute to prevent tangling of the
lines. Upon walking up a steep hill, 1
found Spence smiling. He had some
trouble getting the canape out of the
brush withoutdamaging it, but was just
about finished when I arrived. All in all,
Carol and Spence seemed to have
enjoyed their experience. Carol was a
bit scared ——her fall between the hees

Some people will try everything

who seriously appreciate the
opportunity and the challenge

skydivers.

Note: The SUNYA skydiving club, now
in it's third year, has just purchased
several of their own chutes at a very
reduced rate of $260 for each canape
and pack set. Thishas reduced the cost
of training and the first jump from $60
to $40, and has reduced the price of
each additional jump from $12 to $6.
