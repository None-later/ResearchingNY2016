he class of 1978 is not, as
T rumored, any smarter than-

qther recent SUNYA classes
when it comes to High School
averages and Regent's Scholarship
Examination 'scores. The current
freshpersons might, however, have

something over their predecessors in
their choices of major fields. They, in
accordance with a current trend
a mong college students, are going into
careeroriented fields with the hope
that this will increase chances for post-
graduate employment.

Prior to admission at SUNYA, the
class of '78 had to fulfill admission
standards that had not changed
appreciably over the past five years.
According to R. Thomas Flemming,
Assistant Director of Admissions, the
standards are set up by the group of
applicants on a competitive basis, and
the SUNYA policy is to accept “the best
students first." The mean average of
most accepted applicants has been
around 90% for the past few years, with
the minimum average being 85%-

sfudy. Acceptance is subject to the
recommendations of the department to
which the studentapplies. In 1973-74,
64 students were admitted under
'l'SAP; in 1974-75, 63 students were
admitted, comprising about 5% of the
class of 1978.

Once admitted, freshpersons are
asked to participate in one of a number
of orientation programs offered at
SUNYA during the summer prededing
matriculation. During these programs,
impressions are formed, interests
investigated, and frequently, future
objectives molded.

In comparison to previous classes at
SUNYA, the class of 1978 was found
by Gayle Knibloe and David Hurwitz,
associate coordinators of the 1974
Summer Orientation program, to be

 

interested in the sciences and
mathematics, a trend also observed
last year, featuring many biology
majors and students interested in
pursuing pie-med programs. Knibloe
also observed a great orientation
towards careers which included a
“real concern about what courses are
going to get (the students)a job." David
Shapiro, a 1974 orientation assistant
who also held the position in 1973,
agreed, saying "more students this
year seem to have an idea of academic
direction . . . (they are) more and more
worried about their own plans."
These observations were affirmed by
a census recently compiled by
Leonard Lapinski, Assistant Dean of
Universuy College. In the October 1,
1974 memorandum "University
College Census of Majors," Lapinski
found that "the greatest percentage of
Freshpersons are intending to majorin
the Biological Sciences, with 18.6% of
the current Freshpersons in this
category . . . the percentages have
increased significantly over the past
five years since the percentage in Fall

  
      
      

r

Also pointing towards the greater
careercrientation for incoming first-
year students is a significant increase
in the Business area. In the
memorandum, Lapinski found that
"five years ago, only 48% of the
incoming Freshmen were pursumg a
Business major, whereas the current
class has 11.0% potential majors."

Additionally the number of "open"
majors among first year students has
dropped drastically, from 47.2% in
196869 to a current figure of 15.7%
Lapinski notes that "many advisers
have indicated that more students
seem to be 'occupation' or
employable' interested and perhaps
«ire thinking earlier now of possible
majors."

They have entered on the same
merits of their predecessors yet the
class of 78 seems to have a more
defined sense of direction than the
previous SUNYAfreshpersonclasses.
Perhaps they are overambitious, or,
perhaps they are really the tirstclass to
open their eyes to the realities of life

A Death in .1... F...

e are all going to die. We may
w not like to talk or think about it,
but there is no avoiding it.

And when it happens, someone will be

faced with the third largest expense a'
family usually makes (ranking only
after the purchase of a house and a
car). People would not dream of
buying a house or a car without
making extensive price comparisons
and engaging in serious price
negotiations. Yet they arrange and pay
for a funeral that averages $1,000,
without the cost of burial or cremation,
in a matter of a few hours.

To determine just how the average
consumer goes about arranging a
funeral, NYPIRG researchers
telephoned 60 funeral homes, 20
cemeteries and fourcrematoria in New
York City and Nassau and Suffolk
counties, selected at random, and
requested price estimates for a simple
and modest funeral.

Survey

NYPIRG researchers telephoned a
total of 60 funeral homes in the five
boroughs of New York City and
Nassau and Suffolk Counties between
lanuary 10 and February 20, 1974.
The names were selected at random
from the yellow pages of the telephone
books and represent aproximately
6% of the firms listed. To maintain
uniformity, investigators used the
following approach in each call:

“Hello—l would like some
information regarding arranging a
funeral." Generally, the call was
switched to a salesperson or the
funeral director. "I am trying to
determine the costs of a funeral for a
friend whose husband has died. She
would like a very modest and Simple
funeral. The body is in a local hospital,
they have no grave and might
consider cremation. Could you give
me an idea of the minimum charges for
your services and burial and
cremation." At the end of the call, the
question, "Are there any extra charges
you haven't. told me about?" was
asked.

The researchers also telephoned 2O
cemeteries, four crematoria, and four
casket manufacturers, and used a
similar approach.

Results of Calls

Of the 60 funeral homes contacted,
15 (or 25%) refused absolutely to give
any price data, and six gave only the
price of the casket. Representatives of
these 21 all said, in effect, "We don't
give prices on the phone," some
adding reasons such as:

"Its a policy,”

"It is unfair to the family.”

"it‘s not ethical."

"I don‘t know what you mean by a
'funeral'.“

Another 17 had to be pressed to
provide cost estimates.

The writer, a trained researcher, had
to spend many hours studying the data
in order to make valid price
comparisons. ft is difficult to imagine

how the average consumer, with
limited time and often in an
emotionally vulnerable state, can
make an intelligent decision on such
an important and expensive matter as
arranging a funeral.

Costs of Caskets, Burials, and
Cremation:

The prices quoted in response to a
request for the cheapest casket ranged
from $70 to $385. Only two
representatives of funeral homes
quoted prices under $100, and ten
quoted prices at $250 or more. One
said, “the cheapest casket is $150, but
really wouldn't want it. For $300 and
up, it is presentable." Another stated, “I
can't give the price of the cheapest
casket, there are so many."

in an attempt to compare these
prices with wholesale costs, we
contacted several casket
manufacturers listed in the Manhattan
yellow pages. None would give any
price information, claiming that only
licensed funeral directors could be
given prices. However, a recent
television documentary presented on
WNBC TV on February 3, 1974,
illustrated "Death American Style" and
estimated the cost of building a
pinewood casket at $15.

‘ Cremation is simply the disposal of a
body by incineration. The body can be
cremated aftera funeral service, in lieu
of burial, or without a funeral service,
having been brought directly from
place of death to the crematory. (This is
known as “direct cremation") in either
case, arrangements must be made
through a licensed funeral director
who supervises arrangements and
files the necessary papers. The
crematory charge is generally $75 -
$100 plus the funeral director's
charge. The cost of cremation with
funeral service is the same as the cost
of funeral service with burial.

Fifteen of the 60 funeral directors
quoted prices for direct cremation at
$235 - $687. Only two were below
$300, and about 50 percent were in
the $400 - $500 range. One New York
City memorial society recommends to
its members five different funeral
homes which charge between $169
and $265 for direct cremation.

We made telephone calls to 20
cemeteries in order to determine costs
for burial. The approach was the same
in each case:

"Hello—l would like to know the cost
of the least expensive grave, charges
fro opening and closing of the grave,
perpetual care and purchase of

markers and headstone."

The ‘60 funeral home
representatives were also asked for
this same information, and 20 of them
gave burial cost, although only five
specified names of particular
cemeteries. All representatives of
cemeteries contacted were willing to
give prices on the telephone, and only
one said, "1 don't like to give
information on the phone—unreliable
people call."

The cost of purchasing and opening
and closing a grave ranged from $195
to $700. About 33 percent of the 32
which provided full data quoted prices
below $400, and 60 percent were in
the $400 - $600 range. In' several
cases, an additional $300 -$400 is
required for perpetual care of the
grave. Others state that perpetual care
is included in the purchase price.
Markers and headstones cannot be
purchased through cemeteries butare
estimated to cost $150 -“$200 for
bronze markers. 3

Memorial Societies

Memorial or funeral societies have
been organized in many areas to
provide aid in planning more dignified
and less expensive funeral or
memorial services. They do not
conduct funeral services, rather, they
provide information about such
alternatives to traditional funerals as
cremation and donation of one's body
to medical science aswell as providing
members with names of cooperating
funeral directors.

Recommendations

The last ten years have seen little
improvement in the funeral service
industry's attitude toward consumers.
The memorial societies provide a
realistic alternative, but the total
national membership on only 65 10,000
means that most people faced With the
need to arrange a funeral do not have
an advantageous bargaining position.
The riiost significant improvement has
come from a regulation passed in 1969
in New York State requiring funeral
directors to prOVide customers With an
itemized statement of costs.

NYPIRG recommends:

1) Inclusion of representatives of the
public on the Board of New York State
Funeral Directors Assomation,
Metropolitan Funeral Directors
Association, and United State Funeral
Directors Association.

2) Requiring all licensed funeral
directors to post cost estimates of
funeral services using
minimum/ maximum price ranges
where appropriate. These should
follow the present list required for
itemization of statements of cost, but
would be available to potential
customers before contracting for
services. Funeral directors should also
be required to give out such
information in response to telephone,
mail, and in person inquiries.

3) Requiring every funeral home to
make public its annual volume,
number at funerals per year, cost
materials, and profit figures.
