certainly deserved a hero's welcome,
as he was one of the outstanding
players on Albany's greatest football
team. .

It was a great season for Tommy.
He has certainly developed in his
two-year stay, after gaining 630
yards last year. Tommy got off to a
great start this year on his way to a
thousand yards. He was picked as
one of the ECAC players of the week
for four successive games. including
his big 213-yard performance
against Brockport in just two and a
half quarters of action.

DcBlois needed just over two hun-
dred yards in his last three games to
reach the thousand-yard mark. That

won. DeBIois would already broken
that mark. But Tommy never com-
plained. always adding that Ford
knew what was best. ‘
Against RPI in the final game
Saturday. DeBIois came up against a.
really tough defense. He peeked
away at his total with short scampcrs
throughout the game. Near the end
of the contest Tommy needed only
sixteen more yards to put him over
the top, but there was some confu-
sion on the sidelines: Nobody on tho

ﬁle. A pass went to Cleary for a

Finally an announcement was mede’ ‘

over the PA and Fordput his head
phones on and found out where
DeBIois stood. ’

“Tiny” Holkswey got the ball back

for Albany. when he intercepted a _

pass on RPI's ten yard line. Theplay
calls were simple; it was DcBlois up
the middle. On ﬁrst down he went up
the middle for a touchdown and he
needed only six more yards.
Tommy was fortunate that RPI
continued passing and missing their
receivers. as the clock moved over so
slowly. With 20 seconds left. Albany
took over on downs. The ball went to
DcBIois for three;but DcBIoisdidn‘t
have a good grip on the ball and he

' fumbled it away. “I thought it was

over. I had my chance and I blew it."

Storybook ending

But it wasn‘t over. as R Pl threw four
incomplete passes and the Danes
took over with only two seconds to
play. “I think the defense wanted it
as badly and they got the ball back
for me.” It was a storybook ending.
as Joe Rinaldo blew Mike Carbone
out and he opened up a big hole for
DcBIois. Tommy soampercd thir-
tccn yards up the middle and this
gave him a season ,total of |009
yards. “I was a lot more nervous
when there were 20 seconds left. it
really felt great afterWards."
