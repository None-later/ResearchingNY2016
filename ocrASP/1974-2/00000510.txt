Haber New Vice-Chairperson

by Brent Klgner

' Central Council decided Wednes-
day night to hold Fred Stokelin
responsible for $630 worth ofcarpet
installed last week in EOPSA‘s cam-
pus Center ofﬁce. to cancel EOP-
SA's order for drapes. and to un-
freezc EOPSA'S budget. EOPSA's
budget was frozen last Friday by the
Executive Branch since no SA of-
ficial had signed the voucher; this is
in accordance with Finance Policy.
Earlier in the evening. Seth Haber
was elected Vice-Chairperson to
replace Lew Fidler who moved to
Chairperson tipon Erie Klein‘s
resignation last week.

file annual question of EOI’SA‘s
(liqual Opportunity Program
Student‘s Association) autonomy
from Student Association was thrust
on Council live months early this
year as a result of a violation of SA
Finance l’olicy.

Finance Policy requires that
purchases by any SA-funded
organization must be approved by
either the President. Vice-President.
or Controller ofSA. Recently. [SOP—
SA ordered from Sears a $200 set of
drapes and $630 worth of wall-to-
wall carpeting. Signed only by EOl’-
SA President Fred Stokelin. the
purchase order for these expen-
ditures was presented to Sears and
the carpet was subsequently in-
stalled.

SA President l’at Curran and
Comptroller Jerry Albrect came to
Council Wednesday with a proposal
for the thawing of their budget.
Curran's motion included. in addi-
tion. provisions that SA disapprove
payment for the carpet and the
drapes.and that SA and EOPSA of-
licials meet to work out a new set of
budgeting guidelines. Each of the
four parts of the motion. which was
voted on ml .rerialmn (by section).
were passed.

As a result. EOl‘SA will be forced
to cancel the orderon the drapesand
Slokelin will be held personally
liable for payment on the carpet. It is
expected that EOl’SA will sponser
some sort of donation drive to help
Stokelin raise the $630.

EOl’SA contends that. since
Council is made up of“whitc. middle
class" students. it cannot understand
the needs of the primarily black
liOl’SA and thus has no right to
legislate on the group's internal af-
lair. Asa result. EOI’SA is one ofa
very small number of groups that
receive a lump-sum budget. The ex-
tension ol this kind of funding. BOP-
SA feels. is that all purchases should
be automatically approved by SA
since subjectivity is inherent in any
SAdecision.

Most of Central Council. on the
other hand. viewed that it is the duty
of the Controller to approve or dis-
approve all purchases by SA groups,
including EOPSA. When a purchase
is considered extravagant. it is SA's
responsibility to prevent it. explain-
ed some Council members.

Council was practically of one
mind in rejecting EOI’SA‘s claim
that the group should have full con-
trol over how it spends its money.

Only Jon Levenson. Candi
Mayer. Steve Meyer. Mike Sakoff
and Mark Waldman voted in favor
of having SA provide EOPSA with
the funds for the carpet.

Voting for disapproval of the
voucher were: Lew Barr. Andy

Bauman. Gary Bennett. Kirk Davis.
Maureen Demaio. Andy Dolan.
Lew Fidler. Andy Goldstein. Seth
Haber. Mark Hammer. Roberta
Harwitt. Dave Kenline. Sue Leboff.
Arthur Levine. Rick Meckler, Stu
Simon. Alan Spivak. and Ken Wax.
Linda Shore was the lone absten-
tion. .

Earlier in the evening. Seth Haber
was elected Vice-Chairperson of
Central Council. replacing Lew
Fidlcr who had becomeChairperson
upon Erie Klein's resignation last
week. Haber won on the eighth
ballot on a 17-0 decision over Ken
Was. l-‘ourothercandidates~— Gar-

plurality on the seven previous
ballots. was able to obtain the two-
thirds vote required for election.

was soundly defeated.

History Department's appeal of the
State Doctoral Council‘s recommen-
dation for the tenninution ofits doc-
toral program. It passed a bill es-

History ProfessorsRemain Quiet
Until Nyquist Decides PhD Fate

by Nancy Albaugh
History Department members are
remaining“ silenth about their il’hl)

program‘s "unacceptable" rating by i

the State Doctoral Council. Com-
missioner of Education Ewald Ny-'
quist still must make a decision on
whetheror notto keep thatprogram.

Department Chairman Joseph
Zacek said. “The main point.and we
in the department all feel pretty
deeply about this. is that we don‘t
want to prejudice this delicate final
stage of the process.“

The evaluation here is one part of
a State Education Department pro-
ject coordinated by Dr. Dorothy
Harrison that will evaluate all the
Phi) programs in both publicand
private institutions -— in an effort to
"cut out any weak programs" in the
state.

According to a recent New York
Times article. the State is “ordering
the termination" of Albany‘s
program. among others. because it is

of " 'inadequatc quality.‘ "

Zacek. who was appointed chair-
man to replace Kendall Birr. said.
“One thing about the article is that it
implies that the decision has already

been tnade. This is ‘not true.” The

evaluation process has gone through
a lower level committee called the
“History Program Evaluation Com~
mittee." ’l‘hat committee then
reported to the Doctoral Council.
"Another thing the article im—
plies." Zacek continued. "is that the
low rating was given because of the
quality of the program. This is un-
true. l'hc hasic charge was that the
depaiti t .t v 'o- too small. in
ntltnhct of lIL'idS. faculty and
students." l’hl)s are now offered in
American. Modern European. and
Latin American History.
Defending the “small. elite
program" rather than a larger one
for Albany. Zacek said. “That is only
one view oftlie profession — -that the
dcpanment should be large. I per-

sonally don't agree."

In an evaluation given to the
history PhD program in l97| by
what Zacck calls “a noted historian.
Shannon.“ it was recommended that
"we remain small and intensify in a
limited number of fields. We have
deliberately chosen to shape
ourselves into a small. selective in-
stitute rather lhana large program".

As well. the ﬁnancial crunch that
hit many universities in the late six-
tics limited the expansion of the
program. '

Another criticism of the State
Education‘s higher level committee
was that the department lacked
"tamous faculty." Zacck remains
proud of what he terms his "matur-‘
ing faculty.”

Zacek is optimistic about the
chances for the program's survival.
Nyquist. he says. “can read our retﬂ’
[about 25 pages long]to the evalua-
tion and will see we are worth keep-
ingalive asa I’h D program. In a cou-
ple of years. we would be a really
solid department. hcyond criticism."

Nyquist has reportedly already
reversed ratings of two history I’hD
programs w one at the University of
Rochester and the other at SUNY
llinghamton from the second level
probation category to the approved
category. Albany‘s program.
however. was rated in the third
category  unacceptable.

According to sources. Nyquist‘s
final decision will be announced iit
December sometime.

Department Remains Quiet

Until that time. members of the
history department are remaining
silent about the process. I‘We know
what‘s going on. We're not doing
anything more rigorous because we
don't want to rock anyone‘s boat. I
am confident that we can use quiet
means to help solve the problem."
explained Zaoek.

Vice President for Academic Af-
fairs Phillip Sirotltin has been equal-
ly quiet about thedecision. He seems
to feel that any publicity about the
ease might hurt students now in the
program andthose who already have
their degrees.
