Students Learn the Good-Life

CEDAR FALLS. IOWA—A '

pioneering program to introduce
wine and gourmet living to college
students has become a permanent
extracurricular feature after a pilot
project at the University of Northern
Iowa here. Organizers of the “Wine
‘n' Dine" program, the ﬁrst of its
kind in the nation. say it was in-
itiated to give students training in
social skills.

College Offers More Tmehe liars

Program originator Russell
Davis. an amateur chef and wine
lover, started Wine 'rt‘ Dine with the
blessing of other UNI ad-
ministrators. "Tight schedules and
limited opportunities often force
college students into drinking and
eating habits that they themselves
don‘t really like.“ Davis said in an-
nouncing the formal adoption of the
program at UNI. "I think it is the
responsibility of college administra-
tionland faculty to offer more ex-
periences than are available in
cafctcrias and local bars."

To provide those experiences.
Davis began inviting 34 studentsand
tottr to six special guests from the
University and tltc community-at-
Iargc each week to a candlelit seven-
coursc mcal accompanied by
California wines in a private dining
room of a UNI dining complex. The
program has been so successful that
it prompted the complete remodel-
ing of the two rooms used for the
dinners and other special events.

The six cpicurcan menus for
students and their guests inclttdc on-
trees such as craband shrimp stuffed
flounder. Szckcly (iulyas. and breast

of chicken on ham with cahmpignon

‘ sauce. The soup course may be a
,consomr’ne or tomato bisque, with

desserts ranging from Black Forest
tone to cherries flambe.

“If we are going to teach students
something about responsible drink-
ing.“ Davis said. “then I think the
best way is to introduce them to
good wine with good food. Wine is
the traditional beverage of modera-
tion. and of course. it's most en-
joyablcand appropriate when served
with food."

In a get-acquainted period before
the meal begins. Davis serves a
California wine punch or a hot spic-
ed wine drink. He selects California
wines to accompany the meals and
discusses the subtleties of each wine
with his student-guests. After the
meal. students remain in the dining
area for discussions over California
Sherry or Port.

California Wines More Popular

Davis said his decision to serve
only California wines is supporth
by research into the preferences of
young people. He citcs a nationwide
series of compa ratch “blind”
tastings of Culifontia wincs against
their forcigtt counterparts. In those
tastings, Davis points out. the 50,000
participatingyoung people preferred
California wincs six times out of
seven to foreign wincs costing at
least twice as much. Davis said the
tastings confirmed California'sabili- I
ty to offer the b'cs‘t'ln‘ wine vallltgj t

Reaction to the program has been
almost entirely favorable. Davis
reports. He said student response

was best summed up by a Cedar

Falls junior who told him. “It's;

perfect for our age group. We’ll be
running into formal situations more
often as we get into careers. A lot of
us were brought up in rural areas.
How else are we going to learn this
stuff!“

To help students prepare for the
Wine ‘n‘ Dine sessions. and for a

lifetime of gastronomic enjoyment. '

Davis give‘s the participants his own
copyrighted booklet on restaurant
etiquette and wine selection and ser-
vice. The title. “Lobster Utensils‘i'm

sets the pace for the light and jovial
approach that Davis sticks to
throughout the booklet.

(AP) The first day of a new as
designed to let students see what's in ‘

their school ﬁles brought lots of con-
fusion and little action. i
' The problems centered over a
provision of the law that seems to re-
quire colleges to let students and
their parents see the complete file: —
including things such as conﬁdential
recommendations and evaluations
that previously were kept secret.
Several university ofﬁcials said
they interpreted the law differently
and had no intention of disclosing
the confidential information. Other
educators predicted that the law —
which gives schools 45 days after a
request to produce a file — would be
changed before the question ever
comes up.

Daniel Steiner. general counsel at
Harvard. had said earlier that the
school was removing secret letters
from the files because of a “moral
obligation“ to respect the confiden-
tiality of documents written before
the law went into effect.

 

Sapir Promotes “A liya ”

by Sue Lebol‘f
Pinchas Sapir. chairman of the

Jewish Agency. is an energetic sep-

tuagenarian who until his recent
retirement from politicallifcwas one
of the most powerful members of
Israel's “Old Guard"—the aging
founders of the Israeli Labor Party.
Now. in approved Zionist fashion.
he wishes to devote the restofhis life

'to promoting “aliya”. immigration

to Israel. This mission brought him
to SUNYA last Thursday after-
noon. ,

The crowd of students awaiting
Sapir‘s appearance in the Campus
Center Ballroom could have been at
a synagogue youth group reunion.
Most of the girls were wearing chais.
everyone knew cvaryonc else. and
the subject of many ofthcmurmured
conversations was visiting Israel.
When Zvl Abbo. chairman of the
Judaic Studies Department and

Great Ski Deal

sponsor of Snpir‘s appearance. got
up on the rostrum and led the singing
of “Havenu Shalom Aleichem". a
Hebrew welcome song. everyone
seemed to know the words and tune.
Several community people from
Jewish organizations were in-
tcrspersed among the students.
Sapir affects the folksy. informal
manner characteristic of many
Israeli politicians including Golda
Meir and the late David Ben-
Gurion. When‘ Abbo announced
that students could only stay for a
half an hour, Sapir admonished him
for being “too official“; and told the

'group not to Worry about time.

“I think Israel‘s main problem is
aliya. Our strength is bringing in
pcople...We want to be more. We
have to be more." This was the core
of Sapir‘s message. For the Old
Guard. aliya has a spiritual

signiﬁcance. The word itselfdoes not.

translate literally as "immigration".
but as “going up“. Emigration from
.lsrael is given the pejorative term
“yerida”. or “going down". It was
Ben-Gurion who once shocked
many Americans by declaring that it
was the duty of every Jew to im-
migrate to Israel. While Sapir‘s
message was not as strongly worded.
it was clear that he valued American
youth above American money as a
necessary condition for Israel‘s sur-
vival.

' While Sapir referred to his own
arrival in what is now Israel in I929
as a “privilege”. it was apparent that
many; students in the audience view-
ed a Wit“ to Israel as right. One girl
asked what Israel could offer in the
way of a career in law or politics.
Another student suggested that
Israel subsidize the airfare for
anyone who goes to Israel to study.
The president of the Jewish
Students‘ Coalition asked whether
the Hebrew University would
modify its tri-mcster system for
American students on the semester
system who wished to spend a term
studying there.

An Israeli who is studying here
complained to Sapir that he wanted

.to return to Israel and had a job
I waiting for him. but that thtgovem-
ment had not yet found housing for
him. Sapir. with an unmistakeably
paternalistic air. reassured the
questioner that as long as he wanted
’ to return. a house would be found
. for him. When the Israeli reiterated
that he had tried and failed to get
housing, Sapir offered to intervene
upersonally if necessary. In this ex-
' change was capsulized the contrast
between the idealistic attitude with
lwhich ﬁrst-generation Israelis such
‘ as Sapir regard their country and the
pragmatic attitude common among
native-born. second generation
. Israelis.

Questions ranged beyong the sub~
ject of aliya. In response to aquery
about Arafat's speech at the UN
Sapir said that he was “shocked but
not surprised" that the guerrilla
leader was accorded a statesman’s
welcome. pointing out that Russia.
China and the Arab bloc now con-
trol a UN majority.

He voiced his opinion that Israel
ought not to annex the West Bank,
adding with a note of uncertainty
that he believed the majority of
Israelis feel as he does.

In accordance with Sapir's wish.
the meeting did exceed the half hour -
limit. At the end, heasked those who
‘ intended to live in Israel to raiseltheir

,hands. At least 20 hands went up
=causlng a broad smile to appear on
ithelace of the aging Zionist leader.
