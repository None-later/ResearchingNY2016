Child Care Agency

Balatmmtes

Adds the Family Touch

by Andrea Herding

The family living at 50 South
Main is a rowdy bunch. The porch’
door. minus the plate of glass
Charlie managed to put his hand
through last week. swings open and ‘
within ﬁve minutes the house if full
of activity. The kids are home from
the dentist and it's “energy release
time.” A couple of the boys light up
and relax while the stereo competes
with the sounds of wrestling,
laughter. and platformed shoes bop-
ping up the narrow stairways.

None of the kids bear even the
slightest resemblance to each other.
It's a different kind of family with a
formal title: Abba Beth Home Inc..a
child care agency. ""

The home can be described as a
residential treatment center for the
care and sheltering of abandoned,
delinquent. handicapped,
emotionally disturbed. and children
with special needs. all experiencing
difﬁcultiesralhome,in the communi-
ty. and in school. But the seven boys
living at Abba Beth have a dim con-
cept of the agency bit. It's their
home.

The boys in the program now
range from II to I8years. They were
placed there by either state agencies.
family court. or troubled families.

“What we're striving for. and it‘s a
real struggle sometimes. is to make
these children as close to a family as
possible. This means mother and
father ﬁgures and a lot of love and
caring," said Stan Haluska. co-
founder and now executive director
of Abba Beth.

Stan. 25. has been working with
child care agencies for seven years.
He was a counselor at Albany
Childrens Home when he met Steve
Lewanick who had dropped out of
SUNYA after his freshman year to
work with kids. They both felt that
there is an important need for the
family element which is lacking in es-
tablished childrens institutions. So.
they put their dreams under a title
and started Abba Beth in Octoberof
I973.

The philosophy behind Abba Beth
is simple. If you take kids with
problems out of their disruptive or
abnormal living situations and place
them in a regular home environment
with normal expectations. they will
progress and live up to those expec-
tations.-

The live-in staff are in their twen:
ties. Despite their age Jan Potenslti
and Paul Blaster come across as

pa rental figures and even the
tonghest adolescents in the bunch
listen to them. Beds are made. ﬂoors-
are sweptand the assigned chores are
completed to satisfaction or else
there's a lot of "discussion" at the
Wednesday night wipe session:

At Abba Beth these kids are given
the love. care and stability of struc-

tured family life. It is important that -

they know what to expect and what
is expected from them. Every night
there is something to do. School
nights everyone is in by 9:30 and in
bed by I l :00. Saturday night is fami-
Iy night. The boys decide where they
want to go. It can be a movie or free
bowling provided by this University.
as long as everybody goes.

Monday and Thursday are “out”
nights. Everybody's got to get out of
the house and into the community
for at least an hour. They've made
friends in the neighborhood and a
few of the boys have taken an in-
terest in the girls across the street.
The community has adjusted to
Abba Beth, Paul said their reception
“wasn‘t too bad.“ “They thought we
were all dopers but once they found
out what we were doing they calmed
down.“ he explained.

There‘s always someone on duty
with the kids. Jon is a SUNYA un-
dergraduate who started in the
program for Community Service.

She and Paul are co-directors of the
residential staff. The titles exist only
in hopes of expansion because right
now there is no one for them to
supervise.

Abba Beth needs volunteers.
“Anyone interested. we are asking
you tojoin our family. You‘llbe here
for the kids and they know it. That‘s
what is going to make it work——
people caring.“ In this house there is
room for two more residential
counselors. It involves twenty hours
a week in exchange for room and
board. Volunteers forjus‘t a few;
hours of one-to-one companionship ;
per week are also needed. Abba.
Bethers explained.

Money is tight. The staff is on
retroactive pay and the organization
is about four thousand dollars in the
hole. They pay the rent. eat, and
have furnished the house through
donations by individuals and church
groups. They are trying to get cer-
tiﬁcation as a state agency. which
would mean money. They want to
open more houses so there can be
more families like them.

WOAnniversaries

Members of the Baha'i Faith in Albany have two religious anniversaries on

. November 26 and November 28; both are related to 'Abdu'l-Btthtt, son or

Baha'u‘llah. Prophet-Founder of the Covenantnlt was on this day in mm
York City that ‘Abdu'hBaha, during his visit to America. announced to the
American Baha'i community that he was the center of his Father‘s
Covenant—theperson who Baha'u’llah promised would lead the Bahrt'is
after His death. '

November 28, the Ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha commemorates the death or
‘Abdu‘FBaha'on this date in l92l. ‘Abdu'l-Baha was the eldest son of
Baha‘u'llah (the “Glory of God”). He was born in Tehran, Persia (now Iran),
on May 23. 1844. His name means “Servant of the Glory,"

He shared persecution, exile and imprisonment with his Father. and
remained a prisoner in the Holy Land until I908. He was appointed by
Baha'u‘llah in his Will and Testament as the Center of His Covenant. to
whom all Baha'is must turn for instruction and guidance.

After release from prison. ‘Abdul-Baha undertook extensive teaching
tours in Egypt and Europe. and spent eight months in the United States in
I9l2. where he spoke in churches. synagogues. universities. and to
philosophic and scientiﬁc societies. His visits were given wide acclaim. and he
was honored by government ofﬁcials and community leaders throughout the
country. Hespoke inalmostevcry majorcity from coast to coast. i‘iL‘lliu) itllti
the cornerstone of the now world-famous Baha‘i House ol Worship in
Wilmette. Illinois on Chicago's North Shore.

‘Abdul-Baha is regarded as the Perfect Exemplar of
teachings, but not as a divinely inspired Prophet.

The Baha‘i Faith is an independent world religion that has spread to over
333 countries and territories. Baha'is see Baha'u’llah as the Bearer oi God's
Word for this age and the Promised One of all religions. The teachings oi the
Faith revolve around three basic principles: the oneness of God. the ottcncss
of religion. and the oneness of mankind. Informative discussions are ilL'it‘ at

by In.“ I. urm— t
With the passing of the record cc-

op bill on November 6, Central.’
' Council has suggested that the FSA

rid itself of the barbershop and open
up the space for a record co-op.
The Student Association's posi-
tion is that if a service is student
oriented and loses money it‘s all
right. but if a service is faculty
oriented and loses money that is un-

acceptable. The thinking behind I

such a policy is why should students
pay for a non profit service (such as
the barbershop ). used mostly by
faculty. Therefore. the SA believes
that the FSA should rid itself of the
barbershop in any case. and suggests
a record co-op as an alternative. If

not a record co-op something else, ‘

possibly an SA contact ofﬁce. with
services such as distribution of tax
cards. forms. and other functions.
The SA office would remain as is.
with ﬁle cabinets and records.

The idea of a record eo-op
originated a few years ago. At the
beginning of this semester David
Coyne appointed council-person
Andy Goldstein to research the
feasibility of such an operation.

Goldstein proceeded to call the
University of Buffalo. which
presently hasan operating record cos
op, to get information on dis-
tributors. the type of help (volunteer
or paid). and other factors involved
with its operation. The U. of Buffalo
has an inventory of $25.000worth of
records.

Goldstein then contacted a record
distributor in this area. the United
States Records Company. The com-
pany said the co-op could start with
a $I0.000 inventory (worth of
records) which may increase to $20.-
000.

: Rec-0 

The main problem faced: by

Goldstein war the question of space;
where to put the co-op? He ﬁrst went

‘to's'ee Alice Corbin. who manages

the space available in the Campus
Center. She said that there was no
space available. He then went to the
Performing Arts Center but was
again met with the answer of no
available space.

Sue Pierce, head of Residence.
said there was room on Dutch Quad.
Goldstein went to see Paul Doyle.
Dutch quad coordinator. Doyle said
the available room was presently be-
ing used for garbage collection. The
distributor,U.S. Records. said no to
the idea because of the security fac-
tor. It was out of the way for most
people. and the insurance would be
too high. The distributor preferred
the Academic podium because of its
accessibility.

Through communications with
other SA ofﬁcials. the idea of the
barbershop came up. The advan-
tages of the barbershop included its
location (in the Campus Center) and
its size (being large enough to house
a record shop). ‘

The barbershop is contracted by
FSA. It loses approximately $6,000
a year. Its customers are mostly
faculty.

The FSA proﬁts from the follow-
ing:

I. Food Contracts.

2. Pinball Machines—
approximtttely $15,000 a year.

3. Washing Machines—

approximutcly $3.000 to 534.0005’

year.
It loses money on the following:

1. Check Cashing—approximately

514.000 a year.

2. Bowling Alley—mapproximater

$3.000 to $4,000 a year.

 

 

Anytime. Go Groylmund.

The SA believes that since check
cashing in used by students and loses
money, and pinball is used by
students and makes money. they
balance out. The same with the
washing machines and the bowling
alley. But the barbershop caters
mostly to faculty and few students.
The money lost by the FSA is com-
pensated for by the students through
the food contracts. The FSA makes
the most money through food con-
tracts. The SA therefore believea the
barbershop should be abandoned
and suggested the record oo-op as an
alternative. As stated previously. the
SA doesn't mind if money is lost on
student oriented services. but it does
show concern when money is lost on
faculty oriented services paid for by
the students. Therefore. the

barbershop should be abandoned at
any cost.

has to go through Central Council
for funding. Approximately “0,000
for records and $2,000 for adver-
tising and other expenses will be
needed.

The distributor says that the sales
from a record eo-op could increase
as much as four times, up to $40,000
a year worth of business.

Before a filial decision can be

to those people who do use the

there are barbershops accessible to

In Room ISO in the Campus-
Center there are two ofﬁcials from 1
the Veterans' Administration who
are there to aid veterans on campus. _

They are there to answer any
questions on beneﬁts. educational or
otherwise. and to provide assistance
with problems a veteran may have.

toll-free number is just a general
answering service.

Fenton handles 25 to 30 veteransa
day and claims to be 85% to 90%
effective in solving their problems.
Tom feels that the V.A. encounters
problems due to the volume of Work
and a lack of sufﬁcient staff at deci-
sion making levels. resulting in a
constant backlog of work. As a
result. your initial contact in New
York is only able to write down your
problem and refer it. rather than
dealing with it immediately.

Volume 0f Vet Work Is High

The volume of work in New York
is high.They handle over one million
veterans who are receiving all types
of beneﬁts and their work force is
only 200 people. When the work
load gets great. after the ﬁrst of the
month. a response to even a simple
problem may take a long time. So
when one hasa problem he may have
a few thousand veterans in' line in
front of him. and it takes time to
process all of them.

Fenton said to those veterans
who Were given a special payment
due to a hold-up of a check that this
is called a “running award” cycle. If
the check were issued. for example.
on the 15th of the month, the next
would arrive on approximately the
same date. not on the Ist of the
month. To get this changed is quitc ‘
involved. so it would be worth it to
leave it alone says Fenton.

Fenton has encountered ll. few
veterans who haw been dissatisﬁed

" with his efforts, and admits to a few

 frustrations because problems aren't
{always solved as quickly ashe‘d like.
