extend itself on a long-term project that doesn't reap any immediate rewardsfor itself.
To help the millions of underdeveloped peoples who today wallow in poverty and face
imminent starvatit'm and death, the direction to turn is within.

In a number of colleges and churches across the nation, yesterday was honored as a

" Fast for a World Harvest Day, a day when concerned Americans refrained‘from eating
for 24 hours—both as a concrete and symbolic gesture to the starving people of the
world. Here at Albany, no such commemoration was held, due in the main to lack of
advance warning. The call to give up a day‘s meal is none the less strong, because the
world’s starvation hasn't ended by the actions of those yesterday.

lt will be immediately thought that one person giving _up food for a daywill not help
any one in India, or Bangladesh, since FSA will simply irecook the food for another
day. The point however is that for each pound of meat not consumed by Americans,
grain that would have been used to feed those animals would now be released to the
places where it is far more severely needed than here at home.

In addition, it is hoped by the planners of the nation-wide fast, that those fasting
would contribute that amount they would normally spend feeding themselves to the
agencies that have taken it upon themselves to lead the fight against starvation. This
would require that FSA bend the rule limiting fast days to one per semester and accept

‘ another one before the Thanksgiving recess. We would also request that they not
simply .give up one dollar for each person fasting, but an amount more closely
approximating the cost of the meals. No one can claim that a one day fast will balance
the world's food equation, but as in most other charitable gestures, it is a start.

Anyone wishing to contribute their day's savings to the effort may contact Oxfam
America. 302 Columbus Avenue, Boston, or Breadfor the World, 602 East Ninth
Street, New York.

Untangling Ma Bell

In what will inevitably be a landmark case, the Justice Department is going to court
to break up the A.T.&T. monopoly. The suit alleges that Bell Telephone systems,
through its ownership, whether in whole or in part of the manufacturing and
transmitting of long distance and local telephone“. service across the country is an

illegal monopoly. It further charges that the Bell system has used illegal practices to I

eliminate competition in all areas of the telecommunications field.
Taking on the monolith of Bell Tel is undoubtedly the most ambitious task that

Washington has ever attempted. The people have been abused by the cartel without.
recourse. The company has always been too large for effective control. Only by.

splitting up the huge conglomeratei can control of this vital public utility return to
effective governmental management.

Branches and Guns

Yasir Arafat, in his dramatic speech before the United Nations General Assembly
last week said that the Palestine Liberation Organization was not a band of terrorists,
but revolutionaries in the style of the American revolutionaries in the late l700's. They
are not murderers, but they carry the Olive Branch\ of peace and the gun of the
revolutionary.

Kiryat Shmonah, Maalot, and now Belt Shean. Palestinian commandoes burst into
residential apartment complexes and systematically murdered its inhabitants. These
are actsj of outright barbarism. “Terrorist” is too kind an epithet for fanatics who kill
without cause, withoutdistinction. Olive Branch? How long will the world delude itself

with respect to thisiPalestinian Murder lncprporated?

'Congress' Myth About Job Safety

Washington—For years Washington
politicians have believed the cruel myth that
having a safe place in which to work is not an
issue which much concerns most citizens, a
myth that each year casts the lives of some
14,000 Americans.

It was not until l97l that the government
established the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, an agency which from
its inception has been a center of bitter
controversy. Labor says it has not done
enough of the right things, business asserts it
has done far too many wrong things.

Both sides are right. At a time when the

agency might have been trying to do

something about the deaths of hundreds of
coal mine workers from black lungand related
diseases. it was focusing a good part of its
limited attention on trying to force even family
owned and run businesses to install separate
toilet facilities for male and female employees,
a luxury many of the owners didn‘t have even
at home.

So cynical was One former head of the
agency about its effectiveness that he
suggested that former President Nixon use
OSHA‘s laxness as a means to pry campaign
contributions from small businessmen: Either
pay up, or we‘ll sic the federal health and
safety people on you. Praise be to God, that
one never made it to the White House.

There is precious little else worthy of praise
to be found about the agency. The most
objective studies show that the same number
of workers die each year from job related
accidents and illnesses as before Congress
established the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration.

This yardstick is an accurate measure with
which to pinpoint the heart of the matter:
Ofﬁcial Washington continues to pay little
more than lip service to job safety.

However. a couple of recent developments
lead me to believe thepicture may be changing
ever so slowly. Metro construction workers,
building Washington's elaborate rapid transit

system, went on strike last week. Some 3,000 .

workers stayed off the job and shut down
subway construction. Their main complaint

was capsuled in one picket sip: “METRO ,

 Ron Hmdren 

WORKERS DEMAND AN END '10 ()N-
THE-JOB MURDER".

Twelve workers have died in the multi-
billion dollar project since its inception in
l969, .most if not all of them in accidents that
could and should have been prevented hud
theic superiors been more attentive to job
safety.

Concurrently, the nation‘s coal miners went
on strike in a walkout that will likely lust two
weeks even if an early agreement is renchcd.
Their main concern is safety. For years we
have known that it is almost impossible to
retire from a career in the coal mines and have
any realistic expectation of living much
beyond age 60 or 65. Years on inhaling coal
dust almost inevitably result in one or more
crippling lung diseases, collectively referred to
as black lung. ,

That is why companies pay miners as much
as 50 dollars a day. The work conditions .m-
such that they have to in order to keep pcoplc.
The question we haven‘t addressed is \thclhcr
a civilized nation Shauld permit corporttttotn
to buy the health of poor people for Stldollnn
a day, and then on toppf that to lcnic thcnt tit
retirement with a isodoiiilr-lI-lllttlllilPCINUH
that won‘t buy groceries. much lcss ptl)’ thc
doctor bills most of them have to short-l mil
just to stay alive.

The job of dealing with this question.nt1dtt
host of similar ones in a myriad of other
industries, belongs totheOccuputiontII Strict)
and Health Administration.

That agency has failed. It has failed ich‘tlllHL‘
the job is tough, and the cottgrcsslullill
pressure needed to get it done huhll'l
amounted to much more than a stream ot hot
air too weak to fill a toy balloon. _

Butjust let us go withoutcoul for a couple of
weeks. and just let congressmen continttc to
drive their limousines over the street bumps
and through the obstacle courses cretttcd by
metro construction, and We just might sec u
change in the Capitol Hill attitude. The and
part is that thousands of the rest of us could
suffer without heat, and thousands of otlmh
die from occupational hazards, in the loot!

SING-ER ARJUT NUCLEAR ARA/19
TA 77?EATY ON THE WEATHER

by Stew Bellus

Before reading a review, one should always
know the mood and personality of the author.
Let it suffice to say, that sending me to cover
the “Women‘s Film Festival" is comparable to
asking Lester Maddox to report on a meeting
of the NAACP.

l was expecting an avalanche of distortion,
prejudice, and Billy Graham-like crusades
against the male sex. What I got was a very
timid and superficial attempt at shaking the
apathetic.

To tltc ignorant. Women's Lib represents
dumb broads protesting against men because
they can‘t get any. and Helen Reddy singing a
httbblc gtttn song with inhecilic lyrics. It's a no
hru. no brains movement based on women's
scxuttl frustration.

Frustration actually is the key word, but it
has more to do with prevailing attitudes than
with the bed. According to a brochure that
accompanied the films, “All images
surrounding us a re images conceived and

' made by tnctt.“

Significantly, all the films were made by
women. The intent was to question mttlc and

female stcrcotypcs by showing how women r

perceive their world, and to open “It world of
female fantasy.“

Well, it wasn't quite that quite dynamic,
even though the evening did start ottt in
promising fashion. in the back corner of LC.
2, tcc-shirts with “Women l’otver“. and
culcndnrs for tltc “Liberated Woman‘s
Appointments“ were being sold for three
dollars ttpiccc.

For fifty cents one could purchase such
interestingly titled literature such as “Jesus
th5 A Feminist." “Violence and the
Masculine Mystiquc", and "Rape-The All-
American Crime.“

It was obvious halfway through the ﬁrst
film that the flicks wcrcn‘t equal to the
souvenirs. The three movies I viewed on
Friday night were all rttthcr simple. and
ignored any of the crucittl issues that women
face todtty such Its rttpc, job discrimination,
lllld second class stttttts tts citizens.

The first film. “Something Different.“ \vttstt
caricature-like tttlc of two women. Vern is tltc
model housewife: plagued by tI ncwpttper
reading. pipe somking. cheap S.().ll. of tI
husband: confined with tt brtIt who brcnks tltc
vacuum cleaner. knocks over plants. and
generally makes Dennis the Menace look like
at choir boy; bored with straightening up the
pictures on the living room will] and dusting
thc tmtntcl. Her only contact with thcoutsidc
world is her constant git/c out of the bcdgotn
window. prohibited Irotn venturing outside to
but it new th rd rohc.

lntcrspcrscd with this drudgery is livu, the
goal-oriented gymnast. Eva‘s work is
difficult; sometimes she is physically and
mentally abused by her couches. She
constantly whines about giving up: the work is
too httrtl and she‘s httd to give up too many
things shc has always wanted to do.

VcrtI and Eva are both imprisoned by their
lives, but with ottc huge difference: Eva has a
successful career to show for ltcr wearincss.
Vern will always have nothing.

Although the film had it somewhat
worthwhile ifsimple message, some parts were
so slttntcd that it was ttlmost silly. Somc
husbands do actually? love their wives.
Bringing up children is not always
synonomous to clntsingufterinfants us if they
were rodents. Many women have successful
careers, in spite of familial burdens.

livn is held up to the viewer as the career
woman. Just by coincidence of course, Evtt
accomplished the mundane act of capturing tl
gold medal in tough. world-wide competition,
and gains the adoration of thousands in the
arena and millions around the globe.

Perhaps the only redeeming message in the
film was a line flashed across the screen and
aimed at all women: "You see. you can really
do it if you try.“

Or can you? The second film, “Anything
You Want To lie." was a brief, outdated, and

not-so-satirical attempt at showing how male
society maps out every step of every woman‘s
existence.

Life for females is a constant comedown. «

Imaginative games are replaced with dolls.
Hopes for the hight school class presidency
change to class secretarial aspirations.

Intellectual pursuits shift towards domestic
training. Political Science texts are replaced
by cook books. Chemical experimentation
'turns into the concocting of baby formulas.

Women would like to be “elegant.
sophisticated,ttnd suave.“ continues the film.
Mttlc norms force them into being "simple.
sweet, and synputltctic.“ Females want to be
“scxutt l, sensual. and erotic.“ No, they must be
“reserved, cool. calm, captivating, and
culturcr

Women Shaket - pa” , _

'Women can't take anything seriously. .
Ithey’re silly. . .Women are always late. . .A
woman should serve her man. . .Women are
never content. . .etc."

If the movie had any effect at all, it was
probably as a detriment to the Women's Lib
Movement. A managerie of screaming,
laughing. mocking. and teasing painted an

absurd picture of the women‘s struggle.

The film depicted a raucous group of
fanatics whose only suggestion for saving the
World seemed to be denying the male sex until
they ended wars. This would seem to fan the
tire of male chauvinism rather than to drown
it. Women have far more intelligence than the
film gave them credit for.

l have no idea whether the ﬁlms shown on
the following two days were more valuable

the films be spectacular. The important thing
is that a weekend full! of movies, discussions.
and communal meals was devoted to a'nd
planned by women. Perhaps nettt time, the
movies themselves can elevate a“
“consciousness raising" weeketﬂ.  "_ _'

The film was made in l97l. It is hard to
believe that it was that recent. The general
notion of unjustiﬁed inferior status is onethat
should irk most women. Unfortunately, the.
lilm causes one to say. “That is true," rather-
than. “Let‘s do something about it!” i, 

The third and final film of theevening, “The
Girl‘s.“ was based on “Lysistrala.“a 2,000year
old Aristophanes play. The cliches and
attitudes seemed almost that ancient:
