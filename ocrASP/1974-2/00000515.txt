He touched her face and ran his
ﬁngers over her eyelids, nose. lips
and checks. She raised her head
slightly and opened hereyes. He bent
to kiss her neck. Around them the
night was alive. Cars passed by in the
distance; wind shook the trees.

“Let‘s go to my room." she

_ whispered. They left the bridge.

walking down the other side.

They slipped quietly into her
room. It was dark. but she didn't
turn the light on. They fell on her

. bed. not saying anything. laying in.

each other‘s arms.

“It feels so good just to lie here.
holding on to you.“

“You‘re right. I feel so safe. so at
peace with everything."

"I wish I could stay this way
forever.”

They curled closer together on the
narrow bed.

“This is all happening so suddenly.
I hope nothing goes wrong.“

“What could?"

“I don't know. it's just that such
nice things rarely happen to me.“

"Don't worry. Just hold onto me.
Please."

They squeezed each other tightly.
not wanting that moment to pass. If
it could only stay that way forever:
warm. soft. and trusting. They rested
there apart from the terrors the
world held. They snuggled together
for a long while, not awake. not
asleep. just ﬂoating in a limbo of
security. it was not to last.

The silence was broken by a
screeching of tires. and the dull thud
of metal on ﬂesh. They jumped up
together. not knowing what happen-
ed. Evelyn turned the lights on and
Adam opened'the' curtain. They
both looked out at the parking lot
behind the dorms. People were run-
ning to the front of the lot. Acarwas
stopped with its light on. engine run-
ning. and doors open. The crowd
had already grown too large for
them to see anything else.

“Do you want to run out there and
take a look?“ Adam said.

“No. There's nothing We can do.
and l'llget too upset. You don‘t want
to. do you?"

“No. I guess not." He closed the
curtains. and pulled the window
closed. Evelyn stood up and began
walking around the room.

“Come back and sit down here."
Adam said.

“I can't. ifcclbad. Everything was
so nice in here, It was quiet and
peaceful. I didn't even feel like I had
a body. I was weightless. somewhere
out in space. And now I'm right back
here in my stupid roominthis stupid
school."

“Don't get so upset. It's not worth

it. Can we get high?” ' I

“l‘gttess so. Wait a  Let me
get my pipe." . _

She withdrew a wooden pipe from

‘ her.dressttr. and began ﬁlling the

pipe. crushing the leaves into powder
as she sprinkled it in the bowl. He lit
a match for her and she took the ﬁrst
draw. The bowl glowed red. and the
tangy smell of the smoke began
ﬁltering through the room. He took
the brown pipe from her. and in-
haled deeply.

Adam sat back against the wall
and looked over her room. The walls
were institutionally white. but there
was little of them to be seen. One
wall was eOmpletely covered by an
Indian bedspread which was orange
and brown. with red and yellow pai-
sley creatures on it. The other wall
had a calendar opened to the wrong
month, some snapshots of Evelyn
and a few other people riding horses.
and a poster of Robert Redford.

“It belongs to my rommate.” she
answered before he asked. "I guess
he‘s cute. but I‘m not crazy about
him. He‘s an alright actor.“ Adam
turned his attention to the bed.
There were four stuffed animals: a
blue elephant. a surprised lookin

zebra. a lion with glasses. and a very»

sad looking bear. The bear looked
very old. He was missing one eye.
and his fur was rubbed off in most
places.

“What '5 his name?"

“Barry. I got him when i was

three. and he‘s never left me. I really,

love him."

“What happened to his eye."

“My brother ripped it offwhen we
had a ﬁght about ﬁve years ago. I
didn't talk to him for two months
afterwards.“

"Can I put on a record?"

"Sure." He found one and put it
on. Gordon Lightfoot‘s soft voice
entered the room. Evelyn turned off
the light.

"Let's try and get back to where we
were before.“ They slipped into each
other‘s arms again. both very com-
fortable. and slightly high. He kissed
her and site opened her mouth to
him. One thing followed another...

Much later she wriggled up arid
moved her mouth near his car. She
licked it and her tumed to face her. A
quick kiss.

"(i‘night.“

The sun stabde at him through

the open curtain. He brought up his
arm to cover his eyes. Evelyn stirred,
opened her eyes. smiled when she
saw him.‘ She tried to pry his arm
away from his face but he wouldn‘t
budge.

“Leame ’lone. I‘m blind.“

‘You‘ll be alright.“ she laughed.

Slowly he relented. and got up.

Thirty minutes later. feeling
almost human. the two got into her
ear. and drove to a greasy spoon
diner for breakfast. "Steaks" and
“Chops” altemately flashed on the
neon sign outside. Inside sat three
old men at the counter. each reading
different sections of a Sunday
tabloid. A huge woman in a shiny
pink sewing dress. with her hair in a
bun. and a gold front toothv took the
pencil from behind her ear and ap-
proached Adam and Evelyn as they
sat down in a booth.

They both ordered fried eggs over
easy. and sank deeply into the red
plastic seats.

“Let'ng to Sparkling Brook State
Park. We can walk alongthe clii'fsidc
trail. ldon‘t think too many people
will be there. We can talk. I really
don't know you very well. do I?"

“I guess not." lteanswertd. “Iiut I
don‘t know you either."

They finished their eggs. and left a
big tip for the waitress. She told
them to have a nice day as she
squeezed between the cash register
and the wall to ring up their bill.

As they drove to the Park. Adam
sat quietly. thinking about the past
twelve hours. He had just met this
girl. enjoyed a night in bed with her.
and now was riding with her to some

NOVEMBER 22. 1974

by Guy Frantic

This weekend. the third and final
film in the series of movies by Josef
von Stemberg and Marlene Dietrich
will be shown. Following previous
presentations of The Blue Ange/and
Shanghai Expressthis week‘s movie
is Dishonared. not among their best.
but a fascinating ﬁlm nonetheless.

The ﬁlm concerns a Mata Hari-
likc spy. played by Dietrich. who is
picked up from the gutter by an
Austrian government official and
given the job of getting military
secrets from the enemy during
World War i. Using her fantastic
pair of legs and asecretmusicalcodc

of her own device. spy X-27 is for u 7

time quite successful in uncovering
treasonous plots and vital informa-

Eugcno O'Nelli'c "its." will be' presented this weekend. It Is dlnctcd by

tion for her country. But during her
'fnisl assignment she falls in love with
a Russian spy. played by Victor
McLaglen. and this love brings
about her ﬁnal downfall.

Like the first two films in the
series. Dishonored bears the un:

mistakabie stamp of the von.

Stemberg-Dietrich team. but it is
not up to the artistic high standards
of the others. The Blue Angel has
more power to it as the sense of a
decadent society on the brink of
collapse is paralleled to the collapse
of the strict. moral school teacher.
Shanghai Express is most noted for
its brilliant cinematography (the
close—up shots ofDietrich in this ﬁlm
are some of the most beautiful
photographic achievements i have

ample abundance in Dishonored.

We had always thought that

many of its counterparts in England.

Perhaps the best dish of all was

Tilt: scallops (with Vegetable and

taste. and not up to the standard set
by the other dishes.

We ordered two side dishes. both
