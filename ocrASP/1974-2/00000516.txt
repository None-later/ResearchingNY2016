a Short Game .

by Jack Uppal

The only way to win a chess game
is to checkmate the opponents King.
Therefore it stands to ratson that. as
a rule of thumb, the quickest games
will be those which are decided by
devastating attacks on the king. It is
sometimes desirable to play a fast
game and end it quickly; in fact some
people (myself included) gain some
sadistic pleasure out of such games.

In order to institute an attack on
the opponents king. certain con-
ditions must be established; The
center should be locked (so that full
attention can be diverted to the side
of the board with the king. Lines of
attack should be established for at-
tacking the king (diagonals for
bishops. files for rooks. ctc.).
Furthcnnore. the attacker should
constantly be aware of possible
sacrifices that may yield a winning
attack.

Here is an example ofun attack on
the king:

As the usual heavy smoke ﬁlled
the dingy dorm room late one night
making the players oblivious to all
but the mesmerizingsounds of the
stcreo‘s tranquil harmony ﬁltering
through the dark and gloomy room,
each player's head. in turn. popped
to contribute a bid to the auction. As
more smoke ﬁlled the room and
mugs of beer were passed out. our
South player began fumbling with
his cards. gradually realiling what a
monster ofu hand he was sorting. He

of the others.

curt 7 Spades.

Ohio's hlcury red eyes and shiver-
ing lingers searched and fumbled for
an opening lettd. Al'tcr awhile. the 9

soiled plttyingtublc. shining through
the misty atmosphere of the room.
South‘s gale bccttmc fixed as North

he ﬁnished. our South dcclurcr

showers of jubilant glcc and ex-

hearts are now good!“ But. you sly
fox. how will you get transportation
back to the board?". was Obic‘s
quick and correct retort.

At this South‘s chin dropped as he
realized his over-surencss and super-
'iiClﬂi analysis had trapped him. as
there was no way to fulfill the con-
tract now.

Note. however, that withoutudia-
mond lead the best way to success is
to ruffthc third round of heartsafter
pulling trumps. then return via the
diamond Ace for a claim.

But with that pcsty lead the dia-

Notes—a) White had already decid-
ed that he was going to attack the

'king. so he positions his pieces to

point in that direction. b) It is
necessary for black to try for P-QIM
at some time. This move only
hinders this plan. Better may be 6.
