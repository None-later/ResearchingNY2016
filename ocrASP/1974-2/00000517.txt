all Jazz Band

by Spence Rama
and Matt Kaufman

‘ The Preservation-Hall Jazz Band
ﬁlled the CC Ballroom Saturday

night, concluding a great musical
Weekend. It seemed doubtful at ﬁrst
that eight old New Orleans jazzmen
would attiact a sizeablc crowd, but it
was a packed house, ﬁlled with both
students and adults old enough to
remember the jazz era.

Preservation Hall Jazz Band is a
catch-all name for several jazz bands
working out of The Preservation
Hall. The band that played here was
the Kid Thomas Valentine Band:
Kid Thomas Valentine on trumpet,
Emanuel Sayies on banjo, Joseph
Butler on bass, Charles Hamilton on
piano. Louis Nelson on trombone,
Paul Barnes on clarinet, Emanuel
Paul on saxophone and Alonzo
Stewart‘on drums.

They were all experts and in total
command of their music. They alter-
nated between slow and lively
numbers, and when they finished
their last number they had everyone
up and jumping to “When The
Saints Come Marching in.“

, Dill Jones opened the show with a
varied program on his piano, con-
sisting of jazz and ragtime. He also
provided. in between songs, a bit of
background on jazz, ragtime, and
the musicians of his time.

In lantiquity the Greeks had a

practice of furnishing thedead with a '

coin. fare to ensure that‘the boatman
Charon would ferry them across the
Styx, the river of Hades, to a place

. where their souls could test 
Pausanias. a, Greek travelleiI arid
geographer of the 2nd century )3 D2,
tells us that Charon firstr appeared
in literature'in the poem “Minyad”
(now lost) —

Then the boat on which embark the _ ,

dead. that the old Ferryman,
Charon. used to steer. . .
and that he was depicted by
i’olygnotus in his painting on the
walls of a building at Delphi in the
5th century B.C.Charon is frequent-
ly represented in Greek art. par-
ticularly on white lekythoi (oil jars),
funerary vases of the late 5th century
B.C. These vases commonly depict
funerary scenes, among them
Charon waiting in his boat for the
dead; at least one shows a woman
offering a coin to Charon.
Archaeological study has con-
firmed this practice—in Classical
and Roman burials, coins have been
found in the mouth or hand of the
dead person or loose in the grave. In
Roman and later periods symbolic
coins or "ghost money.“ represented
by gold foil with or. without coin im-

In Christian mm the pagan-7‘
custom survived side by side with'
Christian practice. Even in modern”
times the ﬁgure Charos or Charon-
tas. oursame Charon, is represented -
asa boatman (depicted, forexample, "
in Michelangelo's The Last Judge-
mam) and often as a personiﬁcation
of “Thanatos” (death itself) in Greek
folk poetry. lyrics, and funeral
songs. Even in the late I900‘samong *
Greeks of Asia Minor and the
Aegean islands, theGreek Orthodox
Church waged a long, futile war
against this practice. but in spite of
edicts forbidding it the custom- per-
sisted. To avoid directly disobeying
the Church the clever peasants devis- .
ed a way of satisfying both 'th'e'lir,
Christian and their superstitious
beliefs by means of a Christian sym-
bol, a little wax cross or piece of
pottery inscribed with across or with
the Christian monogram for “Jesus
Christ conquers." which was placed
on the lips of the dead and was even
called ‘navlon" or fare.
