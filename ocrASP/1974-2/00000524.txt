Whitney. originally from outside

The center is divided up into two
groups: children from eighteen

youngsters from three to six years of
age.according to Ms. Whitney. The
children are supervised by live

'We have the skills to do what we
believe will benefit the children.”
said Whitney. who holds a masters
degree in nursery duration. “We
just don't have the money." The
center. which receives no funds from
the state govemment. is supported
by parents‘ weekly payments.
Parents pay anywhere from $25 to
$40 depending on the size of their in-

Here Comes the Sun’sNew Role,
Solar Energy Hamessed For Heat

by Beverly Helm

One of the most plentiful and last
expensive sources of potential
energy is energy from the sun.
Although solar energy has the ad-
vantage of being non-polluting.
harnessing it is initially expensive.
But because of fuel shortages and
ever-increasing costs. solar energy
has been under investigation as an
alternative source of energy by
SIJNYA's Atmospheric Sciences
Research Center.

This center is involved in the
research and development of solar
energy systems that will make the
best use ol this important natural
resource. the sun. With cncrgy con-
servation uppermost in tltcir minds.
ASRC's investigators have amassed
data on solar energy.

mittee never received s inquest for
funds from the center. Director
Whitney said there was a “mix-up”
in the center's ﬁling for funds last
year.

The University pays the center‘s
monthly utility bill but'does not
cover the center‘s"maintenanee and
feeding expenses. The center spends
$50 a week on food for thirty
children. “We can only afford to let
our cook work two hours a day." the
director explained. “It takes two
hours just to chop the fresh
vegetables that go into our vegetable
soup.”

Despite insufﬁcient funds. the
staff at the center is committed to
feeding the children nutritional
foods. The center‘s eating program
has undergone a radicalchange since
last year. according to Ms. Whitney.
a vegetarian. "The childrens‘ diet
used to consist offrankfurtcrs.cann-
ed beans. and pink cakes with pink
sprinkles. This year we feed the
children only those foods We know
will help their bodies."

A typical lunch includes cheese.
potatoes and vegetables. Canned
foods and productscontaining white
sugar are not served to the children.

Parents do not object to the kinds
of foods their children are served.
Whitney noted. "Usually people are
sensitive about food but the majority
of parents are too busy to even ask
what their children are being scrv-
ed."

Many of the parents did not plan

for their children, she explained, 
“Because of their other obligation. 0
most of the parents spend little timi _

with their children. Some of (h:
youngsters remain at the center all
day from 7:30 to 5:30 and then have
babysitters care for them at night,“

To help bridge the gap between
parents and children. a parent collec-
tive operates at the day care center.
Each parent is required to make
some contribution. howctcr small.
to the center. Some parents build
toys for the children while others
belong to a weekend committee
responsible for buying groccrics.

Whitney plans to establish a
parcnts‘ effectiveness program next
semester. The program “‘1” concen-
trate on makin parents an arc oisuch
problems as child abuse. “We hop:
to get many parents froth the com-
munity involved in the program."
