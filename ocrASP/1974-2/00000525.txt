* . With app oxi, ter 24% of the nation‘s auto worker force laid off either
; temporarily or permanently, and with an 83 day backlog of unsold cars sitting useless
‘ in Detroit, the admission by the Ford Administration that we are ﬁrmly in the midst of
_ a “recession,” for all the value mere lip-service does. caine none too soon. Washington
has long been deluding itself as to the seriousness of America's economic situation, but
i the simple utterance of the word “recession,"lwithout some tough programs to combat
the problem ismerely a cosmetic to hide the ugly wound. Yet, the President feels that
the Administration‘s policy of voluntary controls by individuals is the best course to
follow. 7, The situation, is not serious enough to warrant a. change in policy.
Unfortunately, the politicians at the nation's capitol are too entranced with thehollow
' potver of their words. Apparently they believe that ad mittingthe word “recession” into
their vocabulary-is a dramatic move for which the people should be thankful.

The people cannot be thankful for the quadrupled prices of sugar, an increase due
almost exclusively to the greed of the sugar industry. Nor can they thank the
Government and the coal industry for a package that will raise the costs of coal 64%, a
cost that will undoubtedly be passed on to the consumers. In this case as well, the
largest single cause of the increase will be the greed of the striking miners. Because of
their actions, close to 400,000 workers in businesses entirely dependent on coal for
survival will be laid of f .T hdcycle of inﬂation and recession will continue relentlessly.
Without government intervention, the economy will deﬁnitely straighten itself out,
because as unemployment soars and less people can buy products at the exorbitant
prices, the prices will have to come down. That process would probably take years, and
would mimic the Depression in the severity of its ramifications.

Ford cannot simply ask Americans to voluntarily reduce their.consumption: if
Washington will not admit the seriousness of the problem, certainly Americanswill not
understand the need for the voluntary austerity. The measures proposed by the
President are in all the wrongareas, reductions inessential social services, such as Food
Stamps which would throw the poor into destitution. Faced with a critical choice of
spurring production and consumption to alleviate the recession but at the cost of
aggravating the inﬂation, or combatting inflation at the risk of Depression, the Federal
government should lead the nation in controlling wasteful spending through measures
such as heavy taxes on heavy cars, and tax breaks both to producer and consumer for
lighter more efficiently run cars. American dependence on burning oil must be reduced
drastically. and voluntary measures will not be sufficient to break the strangle-hold
which the oil producing countries haves on the Western world. Unemploymentnwhich
is expected to r‘each seven per cent by March will go far higher without immediate and
substantive measures from Washington.

Hitting the Ceiling

The much heralded “summit” conference between President Ford and Soviet
"Communist Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev was a ﬁne example of mutual self-serving
interest. Returning triumphantly from Vladivostok with what appeared to be a major
breakthrough in strategic arms limitation, Secretary of State Kissinger boasted that
what Nixon couldn‘t do in five years, Ford did in five months. Looking somewhat
more deeply into the arms agreement. a number of stunning realizations arise.

Primarily, the arms limitation is set at a capability which neither side has presently
reached. Moreover, the pact allows the Soviets unlimited opportunity to replace their

conventional warheads with multiple independentlytargeted re-entry vehicle (MlRV) -
warheads. In addition. it allows the United States to further increase its nuclear

stockpile by approximately 200 missiles. The President justiﬁed this ceiling by
asserting that without it, an all-out numbers race would have increased that total far
more than the new limits. Ford has opted instead for an all-out qualitative race instead
of a quantitative one. The difference is immaterial. The point is that more nuclear
warheads may be superﬂuous. At the most conservatiVe estimate, each side has the
capability of destroying each other ten times over.

With the President slicing $4.6 billion in social services in his new austerity drive, the
Vladivostok pact is not one we can look at as an example of progressive leadership in
the midst of economic confusion.

Dirty Tricks Contest Won at F.B.|.

WASHINGTON—Last week. in an
unprecedented move, the Justice Department
revealed that its own P.B.l. was enytged in a
widespread campaign of “dirty tricks“as early
as l956. '

| asked veteran Justice official Joe
“Magnetic Tape" Crowley why the
Department had chosen to wash its dirty linen
in public.

“Dirty lincnl'?“ Crowley shot back angrily.
“Nobody is washing any dirty linen. It's just
that our reputation was at stake."

“I can certainly see that," l responded
gingerly, “and you wanted to let people know
that you weren't going to tolerate illegal
wiretapping, character assassination, and
needless snooping into the private lives of
thousands of innocent citizens.“

“llaldcrduslt and wltippt'ttsnool'," Crowley
rctortcd impatiently. “Young man, I‘ve been
around here for 30 years, and we've forgotten
tnorc about dirty tricks than those
buntblcboobs who were over at the White
ouse will ever know. Yet, just look at till the
press they've gotten. lt's ttot fair, and we
wanted to set the record straighlonccttnd for
all on who the experts were. Why. we were
pulling off dirty tricks before some of those
clteruh checks were even born.”

"1 can see that you‘re pretty upset." I
ventured.
