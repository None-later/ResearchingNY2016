hanties, unpaved roads,
S hollows, tops, mines, mining
companies, Company stores,
Company houses, outhouses,
bathhouses . . . If you wanted to
describe a mining town you could
make an endless list ‘of superﬁcial
details, but to capture the sentiment,
humer, and pathos of life in a mining
town you would have to live in one or
have been born and raised in one or
talk to someone whose life has been
the mines and mining towns.

I've done all three. 1 was born and
raised in Maybeury, West Virginia,
surrounded by small mining towns
and coal miners.The miner's way of life
was the only life style I knew until lwas
six. As'for talking to someone who has
made the mine his life—most mining
towns harbor retired miners who,
having known no other way of life,
choose to spend their remaining years
near the mine which sustained them.
These pensioners will spend all day
talking about their past experiences in
the mine if someone is willing to listen.
Jim McGee is a retired miner who 1
have known all my life. This summer I
revisited West Virginia, and saw lim
again after 11 years.

Thorpe is a small mining town in
West Virginia. lt's typical of most small
mining towns, and it's the home of lim
McGee. Most residents will tell you if
you want to know what life in Thorpeis
like, you have to talk to fim McGee.

lim is in his early 70's. He is short,
black, and scarred with age. He's
missing two fingers off his left hand—
they were cutoff in a mining accident
when he was younger. When asked
about his stumps all Iim says is “you
don't take your living from the mine
without giving it a part of you in
return."

Jim's voice is hoarse. He has silicosis
for black lung), a disease common to
those who have spent their lives
breathing coal dust. You would think
that this would turn him against coal
mining, but it hasn't. He receives black
lung benefits, and will proudly show
you the rewards of such benefits—his
portable respirator, his oxygen mask,
and his hospital bed with push button
controls.

)im lives in a Company house
(owned by the mining company), a
ramshackle of a house built on the side
of a mountain. Company houses are
large, with five rooms, an Outhouse,
and a front porch. Mostare in dire need
of exterior repair. However, this
shabbiness does not always extend to
the interior. The interior of lim's house
is reflective of a middle class life style.
lim owns a new Kenmore washer and
dryer, a GE dishwasher, a Wurlitzer
piano, and a new gas water heater. All
were paid for with cash from his
pension and black lung checks. The
living room, done in rich hues of red
and gold, has wall to wall carpeting,
and conservative, well-made furniture.
The three upstairs bedrooms are
furnished suites, with portable black
and white televisions.

Jim is very protective of his
possessions; he keeps a cleaned and
loaded shotgun near at all times. Heis
a good shot which comes from years of

hunting and shooting snakes.

lim's house, like mosthouses built on
the side of a mountain, is easily
accessible by a steep, narrow,
unpaved road. A word of warning—
this road is about the width of a car, if
you go three inches to the right or left
you will either run into the side of the
mountain or fall off. The road is open to
two-way traffic, but you can only go
one—way at a time or risk a head on
collision. It is impossible to turn around
on it. Some drivers, in order to come
back down, navigate the road and its
sharp curves in reverse gear. Iim
informed me that the road is really safe.
It had been rebuiltduring the winter of
1972, after having been washed out by
a heavy rain. The new road is built on a
solid foundation of wom-out tires.

Although the road is structurally
sate, Jim told me, "you got to beware of
these folks drivin', they can be right
ornery at times." It is customary that
when two cars meet head on, the car
n'ea rest the top or bottom backs up and
lets the other pass. "But, sometimes,"
says lim, "some people so mean and
stubborn they'd rather sit there cussin'
and arguin' than move." When this
happens one driver usually gives in
after a while; if not, the nextcar to come
along settles the argument—two cars
going in the same direction have the
right of way over one car going in the
opposite direction.

The road also poses hidden dangers.

cemetery another car came from the
opposite direction, and he, since he.
was nearest the bottom, backed to let
the other car pass. The bride, frustrated
after coming so close to fulfilling her
mission, decided to spare their lives.

West Virginians are known for
saying "anyone who can drive in these
hills can drive anywhere in the world."

Unlike the big cities, a mining towni
has very few problems with its public
servants, expecially theDepartmentof
Sanitation. Every month the sanitation
truck rolls up in the middle of super to
clean out the outhouse and sprinkle it
with lime (outhouses are cleaned
periodically to prevent excessive
accumulations, and the spreading of
disease-carrying germs). A full toilet is
dangerous; a girl suffocated after
falling into one. During the summer a
visit by the sanitation truck can be
quite arduous since windows and
doors are usually open.

When I sawlim this summer, he was
thinking of installing a bathroom. lthas
since been installed, and in keeping
with country custom the bathroom is
reserved for special occasions, out-of-
town guests who are unaccustomed to
outhouses, slop jars, and hand filling,
round, metal tubs for bathing.

indebted to the store, but has paid off
his old debts. He prides himself on
paying for everything in cash, but out
of old habit he keeps a tab at the store,
choosing to charge his chewing
tobacco and snuff.

When Jim has a good chew he gets to
reminiscing about his past
experiences in the mine. He recalls
how every time he left the mine he'd
thank God for letting him go in on the
hoot owl (night shift), and walk out in
the morning. He remembers how he
and other miners would gather at the
bathhouse (due to the lack of
bathrooms miners bathe, in the
bathhouse located near the mine),
swap stories, and chew tobacco. His
memory is quite vivid. He remembers
the day that l was bom—he took my
mother to the hospital, and stopped to
kill a snake on the way (poisonous
snakes are common in West Virginia,
and West Virginians don't pass up a
chance to kill one. They can be driving
along a busy road, and will stop and
back up to kill a snake, and if the snake
still shows signsof life they will back up
and run over it again). Iim also
remembers his wedding day. When he
starts to remember the bad times he
grows quiet and solemn. He doesn't
like to talk about the mining accidents,
the deaths, the loss of limbs, the mine
closings, the layoffs, and the lean days.
They are personal; they belong to the
past and the mines.

Not every miner is fortunate enough
to come out of the mine missing only a
few fingers or toes. The mine has been
known to destroy a man spiritually as
well as physically. Even though Iim
doesn't say so I'm sure he thinks about
Roy Brown, a close friend of his, when
he thinks about the bad times. Roy was
forced to retire at the age of 38
following a mining accident. Unable to
support his 11 children, his family was
forced to go on welfare. Roy still
couldn‘t keep his family together; one
child died from the unsanitary
conditions, and his twin sons were put
up for adoption. He had to have part of
h is right foot amputated, and this on top
of everything else caused Boy to
become an alcoholic. One night Roy
set fire to his own home and his town.
He went to prison.

Mining towns don't offer much in the
way of entertainment or leisure
activities, so you create your own. Jim
likes to ride around town in his 1973
Buick Electra 225, which he keeps in a
shed built especially for it. However,
lim is unable to drive it because of the
silicosis so he pays someone to
chaufier him around. But, if youkdon’t
own a Buick, the most enjoyable
pasttime in a mining town is those long
atter-dinner-well-into-nithront-
poroh-chew~the~fat conversations with
your neighbors. One is easily soothed
to sleep by the murmuring sounds of
the night, the voice of the mountain, the
full of human voices, and the rocking
motions of the front porch swing.
