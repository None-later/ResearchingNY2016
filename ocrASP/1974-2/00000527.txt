' . _ began approximately forty-
five years ago. With recent discoveries
of sludge approaching the long Island
southem shore beaches, debate has
arisen over. the safety of its practice.

.The New York Bight is a 15,000
square mile area of water off long
Island and New Jersey. It extends from
Montauk Point on long Island to Cape
May, New Jersey, from the coastline to
the Continental Shelf. This area is of
enormous importance as a resource of
economic, environmental, sport and
commercial (fishing) value.

The Eight is also the ultimate
recipient of many of the wastes of the
metropolitan area. Included among
these industrial and municipal wastes

' is sludge.

Sludge is a brownish / black material
left over after various sewage-
treatment processes, a mixture of
human, animal, and industrial wastes.
The material, although it varies with
source [and treatment plant, is about
5% solid and 95% liquid. Nearly six
million cubic yards of sludge are
dumped into the New York Bight each
year. New York City accounts for
nearly 60% of the total volume, Nassau
and Westchester counties 7% and
New Jersey communities the
remaining 33%. The sludge disposal
site is only 12 miles from the long
Island shore.

When the sludge is dumped, the
mixture disperses; some of it is swept
towards shore by the ocean currents
and some sinks to the sea floor.

A great deal of controversy has
arisen over the dumping, and its effects

on the Bight and the Southern Shore
beaches.

In 1973, the debate over the safety of
dumping led the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) to create the Marine
EcoSystem Analysis (MESA) New York
Bight Project. The basic purpose of the

 

 

 

 

 

project was, to assess .the
environmental impact of the present.'

dumping practices. The objectives of
the project were to:

(1)Develop better understanding of
physical, chemical, and biological
processes of the Bight; (2)assess man's
impact on the Bight; and (3)improve
predictions of consequences of
present and proposed actions.

The Interstate Sanitation
Commission (ISC), a regional agency,
the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), (The EPA has responsibility for
managing and monitoring ocean
disposal in the Bight), and
independent researchers have done
studies of the Bight.

Marine Fisheries Service

reported that the dumping of
sludge into the Eight appeared to be
harming marine life by increasing the
rate of disease. Hazardous amounts of
bacteria and metals were found in the
tissues of fish.

In December, 1973 sludge oozed as
close as a half of a mile to shoreat
Atlantic Beach. The sludge has formed
a "dead sea” around the ocean
disposal site, where little or no life
existed. What was surprising about
finding the sludge only a half a mile
away from land was that in September
of 1973 itwas one mile away from land.
Deadly metals may have found their
way into the human food- chain
through seafood. Even if the sludge did
not reach the shore it could have
threatened swimmers if sludge
particles contained disease-carrying
micro-organisms.

This past June, an oceanographer
working on the NOAA MESA New
York Bight project found two large
patches of “a black ooze‘like material"
containing sludge off long BeachThe
sludge, which was a halfmile offshore,
extended intermittently for 3 miles.

I n June, 1972 the National

When asked how the deposit might
have come so close to shore, a N OAA
official replied that the currents of the
water might have carried the deposits
from the 12 mile disposal site.

‘ In July, sludge again was found to
have moved closer to long Island’s
southem shore. The distance of the
finding—a quarter of a mile. "By 1976,
the beaches of Atlantic Beach will be
unusable" said Dr. William Harris, a
marine geologist at Brooklyn College.
The deposited sludge was supposed to
have stayed in its designated disposal
area but ocean currents have pushed it
closer to shore.

he NOAA is doing the bulk of,

federal research on the

sludge problem and has
estimated that the sludge bed is about
3.5 miles off shore. This concurs with
Dr. Harris’ findings.

The NOAA has also established that
currents on the ocean floor flow
northward towards the beaches at least
six months of the year. It is possible that
the sludge has overflown the natural
cavity in the ocean floor at the dump
site and is moving towards long
Island.

During summer months more
sludge accumulates than is oxidized or
utilized by the ecosystem and the
sludge bed expands.

Chemical analysis of long Island
beach sand reveals part derived from
sludge.

Sludge which has drifted to within a
half mile of the beach was being held
in place in large underwater trenches.
The next step (after the trenches are
filled) could be sludge on the beaches.

Even if dumping is stopped it will not
make the sludge go away. In fact the
sludge will be out there for a good time
to come and may eventually wash
ashore anyway.

non-existence of
the EPA has failed

to let be known is that coliforms die
rapidly in saltwater. In sludge they are
protected from the salt water. When
they move towards shore they lose
their protective coating and die. This
does not mean that these same waters
are free from disease-causing
organisms which are almost
impossible to detect. So the value of
coliforms as an indicator of the
approaching sludge is very
questionable. The EPA has not tested
for viruses which Dr. Harris feels we
should be more concerned with.

The Marine Sciences Research
Group who conducted a study of the
sludge deposit site found that a large
area of sludge accumulation lies to the
west and north of the designated area.
Two reasons can be given for this
occurence; (1) dumping has
proceeded short of the designated
area, or (2) that currents transport the
property dumped sludge back to the
north and west. If alternative (1) is
correct, the EPA site may not be the
one that has been used for the past few
years, and the EPA has failed in its
duty to regulate dumping, and this
constitutes violations of its permits
granted to dumpers.

he EPA says that the leading
T edge of the sludge site is
located approximately 51/2 to
6 miles from the shore of long Island.
The Marine Sciences Research Group
investigation began in 1970. At that
time they indicate that the edge of the
dump site was approximately 9 miles
from shore. As of 1974, theGroup says
that it agrees with the EPA findings but
that the EPA forgot that the edge of the
site in 1970 was 9 miles from shore.
This means the sludge is moving at
nearly the rate of one mile per year. At
another part of the Bight, the sludge
was recorded at only 33/4 miles from
Atlantic Beach.

he offshore sludge dump site

poses an imminent danger to

the beaches of the south shore
of long Island. The Marine Sciences
Research Group recommends:

(1)That permits to dump sludge at
the site not be re-issued next February,
when the present permits expire.

(2)That sludge dump sites not be
transferred anywhere else.

(3)That land based alternatives to
ocean disposal of sludge begin
immediately.

(4)That sludge be used as landfill
as a short term alternative, and that
ultimately it must be used for
generating electricity, and nutrients
and fertilizer.

(5)That stoppingthe dumping will
not make the sludge go away. The
sludge will remain there and move to
shore. A type of vacuum cleaning
dredging operation be initiated to
clean up the sea floor which man has
produced over the past 45 years.

on Environmental Quality

submitted a report to the Presi-
dent entitled "Ocean Dumping: A
National Policy". It recommended that
"ocean dumping of all sludge be phas-
ed out and no new sources be allow-
ed." The federal government (the EPA)
designated last March 2 areas 70 miles
off the New Jersey-long Island
coastline as future sludge disposal
sites. The EPA is not seriously
searching for alternatives to ocean
dumping, but busying itself with
preparations for a new area of the
ocean to devastate. Whereas the
NOAA MESA New York Bight project
is studying the effects of sludge
desposits in the Eight, the EPA's policy
is a continuation of dumping with an
eventual phasing out of ocean disposal
by 1981. But by then it may betoolate.

I n October, 1970 the Council

If dumping does prove daneroustothe
beaches and public health then the

' EPA iu st moves the disposal site further

out to sea. This past March, the EPA
decided to move the disposal site from
its present 12 miles off shore to a site at
least 25 miles from the coast. The move
will take from 2 to 3 years. The NOAA's
position on dumping is that it should be
regarded as an interim measure and
that every effort should be made to
avoid long term use of the New York
Bight for disposal of sludge.

In the years ahead many critical
management decisions will have to be
made concerning the rational use and
protection of the New Yo'rk Bight.
Municipalities and state governments
would probably face increased costs if
something else had to be done with the
sludge, but this increased cost mustbe
faced. As one EPA official said, "...But it
is a complicated problem, as are all
environmental problems, because you
end up with a trade off regardless and
hopefully we're going to end up
making the right decision." Everyone
could and should help in making that
decision for it is you who will be using
those beaches and eating the fish from
those waters. You have a great deal of
powerwhen you act as one unit. Inform
your assemblyman, or representative
or the NOAA of your displeasure in
knowing that our waters are being
destroyed. Ask for some legislation
against ocean dumping of sludge. Let's
save what's left!

inafly, one EPA official replied

F when asked about what

federal officials would do if the

sludge turned out (in their eyes) to be

coming from the dump site: "We don't

know. We‘ve never faced the problem

before, so we don’t know what the

options are. Obviously, somebody
would have to do something."
