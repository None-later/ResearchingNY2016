America's nonsmoking majority ‘to'
some smoke-free air is increasingly

being protected by law.

In the past two years, several states
and at least a score of cities have
limited smoking in public places—for
health reasons, not fire safety. Similar

legislation is pending elsewhere.

 worked very well until the press
got a hold of it," the young woman, who
did not want her name published, said
during a telephone interview
Thursday.

“It was a big mess then. It was all
over the radio that it was a ‘Harrad-
type' experiment and that annoyed all
of us. The basic idea behind it was to
get people to learn about each other
and to meet new faces," she said.

Her reference was to The Hound -'
Experimentfa book and movie about
fictional college students who join an
experiment to shed sexual inhibitions.

On Wednesday, the students
announced thatl they were
"postponing" “Switch With Another
Person" after being informed that
college officials were ready to act
against them.

To take part in the experiment, it was
necessary that one's roommate also
take part, the freshman girl explained.

"Everyone who decided to do it had
to decide which roommate was going
to move out," she said.

Students who preferred a roommate
of the same sex or the opposite sex
were separated beforehand, she said.

"At the beginningrwe told them if
they were interested in being in this
just because they wanted someone of
the opposite sex, then we told them to-

get out because that's not what it's all
about,” she explained.

Arizona and Nebraska have since
banned smoking in elevators and

limited it to designated areas of'

hospitals, museums and concert halls.
Oregon prohibited smoking at public
meetings of state bodies. Connecticut
followed this year with a smoking ban
at all public meelings anywhere in the
state. , .

As of Nov. 1, a new section was
added to New York City's health code.
It banned smoking in elevators and
food stores. Dallas last month said no
smoking in nursing homes. Two
proposed anti-smoking measures are
on the agenda of the Los Angeles City
Council.

Anti-smoking proposals have been
rejected in Massachusetts, Ohio and
several other states. In fact, they have
been turned down more often than
adopted. In some cases, they have
been opposed by restaurant
associations and tobacco trade groups,
and sometimes they are simply
ignored.

Along with health consideration.
organizers said the no smoking drive is
being fueled by the increasing
awareness of non—smokers that they
are not a minority.

“Most people don't smoke and their
rights are being violated," said Dr.

According ‘ to the Public Health
Service’s National Clearinghouse for
Smoking and Health, about 40 per
cent of American‘rnen and 30 per cent
of American women srnoke. There are
about 52 million smokers in a
population of about 210 million.

Efforts to restrict. smoking have
varied. '

When Boyd's Coffee Co. banned
smoking in its Portland, Ore. plant, it
cost the company one employee and a
union grievance. The worker quit and
the grievance went to arbitration,
where the ban was upheld as long as
employees could smoke outside the
building.

Restaurants that designated special
tables for smokers have reported
mixed results; most said it was
satisfactory, but some noted a decline
in customers.

Anti-smoking advocates and other
observers said the new no-smoking
signs are generally effective, at least in
cutting down the haze.

Most of the new laws carry fines of
$10 to $25, but summonses are few
and arrests all but nonexistent.
Officials acknowledged that shortages
of police and other manpower make
enforcement impossible without
public cooperation. '

To defend their rights, anti—smoking
advocates said non-smokers should
pressure errant smokers by reminding
them of posted signs or well-known
regulations.

“if a law is on the books it should be
enforced, but if it isn't, the public
should enforce it," said Steve Klein,

director of a lawyers' group working on
a "nonsmoker's bill of rights" in Illinois.

one guy who wanted to room with a
guy and one girl who wanted a girl
roommate—said that it didn't matter
whether they roomed with someone of
the same or opposite sex," she said.

Students were matched up when
names were picked out of fishbowls.

The experiment ended Monday and
students were set to try the fishbowl
again and begin another week with
new roommates when college officials
stepped in. They warned that students
of the opposite sex caught
cohabitating would be prosecuted by
the College Judicial Board. The board
is composed of administrators, faculty,
staff and students.

"Any experiments involving
cohabitation are considered by the
college to be in violation of housing
regulations," the statement read in
part. "Failure on the part of any
students to comply with this order will
result in prosecution under the
College ludicial Board."

The students then "postponed" the
experiment which they said was
designed "to enhance community
spirit."

“The SWAP program is not related to
any kind of sexual experimentation," a
statement released Wednesday by the
students read.

One young man, who ended up
morning with another male, said it was

unfortunate that outsiders interpreted
the experiment as a sexual swap
program. "It's unfortunate that people
looked at the program that way....The
idea of sex was out of my mind."

Normally, males and females reside
in the same dormitories but are
segregated by wings or floors, or in
some cases by alternate rooms, a
college official said. Ithaca College has
a student population of about 4,000.

Many of the participating students
were reluctant to talk with reporters but
the freshman girl talked freely of her
experience.

What do you say to Ralph Nader?
There are slight pauses; everyone is
quiet, reflective, full of awe or simply
tired.

too see him, and when ldid lcouldn’t
think of anything intelligent to say.“

Nader is full of ideas. Does‘he know

"How does it feel to live in the most
corrupt state in the country?" he asked.

"Last month a citizen brought a suit
up against the CIA’s secret
involvement in Chile. The court said it
had no standing. Then who does?"
Nader had another cracker. Don
Ross talked about the probelms of
NYPlRG. ,

Nuclear power is out, according to

Nader. What about students now
training in nuclear physics? “I feel
sorry for the guys; they're being
misledThey've gone through six years
of training, and it’s all over." There’s no
more cider. It's getting late. "I've had
no sleep for two days, so lhave to get
alot tonight.” Nader gets up first and
walks to the door. There is movement
in the room, but no one is following
him. He waits, accepting the delay.

Four or five people are standing by

him. Now's' their chance. One student
looks both ways, then asks: "Would you
autograph this?" He holds out Nader's

Unsafe A! Any Speed. I

Nader refuses. 'Thanks for readin
them, though." He looks awkward still.
"Guess you've got a few days or weeks
off after all the speaking and work
you've done recently," one guy asks.
Nader may have been only a notch
more than six feet, but his stature was
doubled by the force of his personality.
He was looked up to even while he sat
and ate cheese and crackers.

"Are you kidding?" Nader never
smiled, but the facial expression with
this remark was hisequivilent. "Do you
know where l' m going this weekend?
Tomorrow l‘m flying to Chicago, from
there to Salt Lake City, then to Pheonix.
At 6 AM the next morning 1'“ be
coming off the plane in Dallas." He
averages four hours of sleep each
night. But Ralph Nader can't really
separate himself from his work. "1 think
we'll have a great PlHG In Utah. It'll be
UPlRG.” He smiles for the first time, at
that name.

As 2 AM nears, Nader and the
entourage leave the burlding, enter the
parking lot, and go their separate ways.
Nader leaves in a NYPIRG staffer’s
