ﬁ Stopping the Bullets

r'l'o the Editor:

I am wriling this letter to comment upon the

‘prescnialion’of the movie Targels, shown

'reccnIIy. For those of the readers who didn‘t
see the movie. it was about it day in the life of a
moss-murderer; it starred Boris Karloff and a
large selection of explicit dciuils. such :is ll
miin gelling shot in the head and so on. Now. I
wrote an article for this newspaper in which I
salirilcd the movies we have' on campus and
the people who show them. particularly the
movie Deep Throat. which was a hilarious
production. Since I have not as yet such any
rciiciion lo thiii iiriiclc, I assume Ihui the
article was taken in the spirit in which it was
written. I really didn't mean iolluriunybody's
feelings; I think the people who bring us ihc
movies do us it great service. I only wunicd in
reveal the comic llh‘pCCI of them. as I would in
every aspect of campus life. I think that we
need things to laugh zit in these times. and I
believe we can find them wherever wc look.

at metaphor. Mr. BcIIue. but itdoeen‘t quitefil
the picture. ' ’

What does surprise me is the fact that the
ASP. which should be concerned with fair
reporting. sent such an obviously biased
individ uni in tho ﬁrst place. Possibly following
his own beliefs. Mr. BcIIus first states what the
“ignorunl” view of Women‘s Lib is. (which is
something we all know too well). but never
modifies his statement with ii more "learned"
opinion. Maybe he doesn't have one? He
expected “an avalanche of distortion.
prejudice . . . against the male sex.” and
seemed disappointed when he didn‘t get it. He
feels ihiil cruciiil issues such as rape and job
discrimination were not dcult wiIh.

First of all. I would like to point out that
Mr. HclIus intended only the ﬁrst night of a
weekend of films. Secondly. had he piiid any

attention ill kill ll) the publicity llilll bruchurcs.

‘ It
solelyaa attest 
word. of pure terrorism:
the, thorny rather than to
militarily." " ‘

Countlees other enampluuol'  of

terror by the us. can he eeleillhrotfgllout our
history. But the question is. how can we. the
country that reduced Hiroeh‘imelo rubbleend
Dresden to ashes possibly refuse to allow
someone to speak on the grounds till we call
him a terrorist. 11th would appear to be
stunning hypocrisy. "hot/even: policy of not
allowing groups. whose policy is terror to
speak before the General Assembly of the
U.N. is to be adopted. then the U.S.. along
with the U.S.S.R.. France. Great Brilein.clc..
must resign immediately. Because the nuclear
diplomacy that is being practiced every single
day by Ihcse and other countries can only be
seen as a diplomacy of terror.

If we have learned nothing else in the past
several years. we must have learned from our
experience with The People‘s Republic of
Chinil that simply not recognizing ii group of
people will not make those people go away. I
Iruly believe that it is better to give the P.L.0.
ii forum and an opportunity to speak than to
force them to continue to spell out their
dcmainds with corpses.

Stating Their Case

To the SUNYA Community:

On Friday. November I5. I974. the
Educational Opportunities Program Student
Association (EOI’SA) was informed by the
SUNYA Student Association of a chiirgc of
violation of S.A. Finance Policy. Article I.
Section AZ. by our orgiiniuilionjjjisrcsullcd
in II I'rccrc on all funds to our group. the
disruption of operations and uclivilics. and ii
pussihlc Icgzil action being issued against one

IiOI’SA.

attempted the purchase of carpeting rind

authorization. We further suggested that
eulhorinlion be based on the legal nature of
the purdueemrid not left to ihc Controller's
discretion. Our appeal vies flatly denied.

FA

L111: purchase of carpets and drapes by an
S.A. organiution does not constitute an
illegal use of fursds. in accordance with present
S.A. Finance Policies. student tax laws. and
constitution. Nor. does such a purchase
violate existent University policies,
established by the Board of Trustee.

2. The Controller and President of S.A.
agreed that this was. in fact. it legal purchase.
However. they questioned the “spirit” of the
purchase. Thcirdcniel of approval isbescd on
this subjective interpretation and not on
existent policies.

Al the request of the President of S.A.
Central Council. (at the mcciingon November
20, I974) the Council decided to unfreeze
EOPSA‘s budget. However. the President of
EOI’SA was held personally responsible for
the cost of the carpet. in question. Council
gave no basis for this decision. other than the
violation previoust slnlcd.

FACTS

I. Central Council did not deal with the
issue with rcspcci to the Icgzil nature of the
purchase.

2. Several members ol‘CcntruI Council were
under the influcncc of inioxiwics. Ilccr. liquor
und ulhcr stimulants were Iibcrully passcd
:iroiind. ihruughuui Ihc mcciing.

When-us. ISOI’SA is respectful of ihc
piilicius csiiihlishcd by S.A. Central Council.
rind ihc Univuisiiy. we sincerely take issue ill

'Cuuncil‘s failure to iidminislcr fairness in this
siiuiiliun; particularly with respect in the
pussihlc remedial measures. which min be
taken against persons within our
org-.iniriition. We assert that.

A thrciis. Article I. Section A2. of S.A.
I-"nuince Policy has been violated. repeatedly.
with no recourse taken by S.A.. against those
responsible. iind

It thcl'cilS. the purchase of carpet by an
SA. organization is no! illegill. in accordance
wilh S.A. and University Policies. therefore.
EOI’SA should be allowed to make good on
its purchase and that our President should not
be held responsible for the payment.
