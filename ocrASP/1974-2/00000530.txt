depa aren't presented George
I Feydea'u‘s A Flea in Her Bar. The
production. a typical example of the
French Farce. was directed by Dr.
Albert Weiner and presented on
November 20-24. The show.
although quite good in spots, was
just a few levels above mediocre.
The plot of the play'is trite and
contrived, typical of the French
Farce. The production tried it‘s best
to fulﬁll the comic potentialof such a
plot. but, due to a variety of factors.
was unable to achieve it‘s goal.
Technically. the production was
'well conceived and executed. The.
Art-Nouveau image of the play was-
nicely represented in the sets design-
ed by Mr. Robert Donnelly. The
costumes. patterned upon the
drawings of Aubrey Beardsly, were a
fine complenientto the sets, employ-
ing enough exaggeration to un-
derscore the farcical elements of the
play. '
it is unfortunate that the other
aspects of the play did not achieve
the same level as that ofthe technical
aspects. For the most part. the per-
formances were extremely inconsis-
tent.
There were some very ﬁne perfor-
mances in "Flea." fortunately found

’ in the lead characters. E.B. Poppick.

in the dual role of Chandebisc and
l’oche. gave a fine performance. dis-
playing a marvelous upper—class
reserve slowly deteriorating into
hystcrics as the character of
Chandebise became more and more
involved in the dramatic conflict.
Even throughout his hysteria.
however. Mr. Poppick retained the
necessary amount of style and
elegance for one of his character’s
status. Poppick'sPoche. on the other
hand. was absolutely priceless in his
earthy naivete. Probably the most
memorable scenes in the play Were
those of the third act in which Pochc
enters'the Chandebise household.

Pamela Nyberg also gave a nice
performance as Raymonde’
Chandebise..Ms. Nybergpresented a
commanding figure on stage. and
was a pleasure to Watch as she glided
across the stage with the utmost ease
and grace. h

Thom Prager gave an enjoyable
performance in the role of Camille
Chandebise. His vitality and energy
added to the production and. along
with the two above mentioned at:-
tors. brought up the energy of the
show every time he appeared on
stage.

The secondary characters of the
show come nowhere near the perfor-
mances of the three leads. None of
the actors was able to maintain a de-
cent level in his performance. The
widely spaced bitsofburlesque in the
ﬁrst not were all performed with
relish. While the spaces between
dragged horribly. The second act
began on a nice level. which was not
sustained.

    
  
 

Richard Pollack. as Etienne. the
frazzled butler of the Chandebise
household. whined his way through
the role. trying so desperately to be
funny. and never succeeding.

Probably the biggest problem
with A Flea in Her Earwas the direc-
tion. Dr. Wcincr's strong attention
to small bits of slapstick paid offvcry
well. They were all nicely performed
and very funny. But no matter how
many pratfalls and double takes
Were thrown in. it was obvious that
Dr. Weiner completely neglected
whole sections of the play.espccialiy
portions of the second act. The
smooth. flowing hysteria so
necessary to this act and the one
following it was only found at
irregular intervals. It was also ap-
parent that the director bothered
very little with the lcsscr characters
in the show. and their scenes suffered
because of it.

A'common reason
integration of rock groups. a
phenomenon that appears to be so '
prevalent today. is the pressure of
the public. forcing the musicians into
it static and restricting role. An
audience that pays for a ticket to see
a group Wants—and deserves—to
see and hear their favoritenunibers’.
if a group decides to experiment in
new directions, they relinquish the
role that they themselves created.
and run the risk of falling out of

favor with their fans. (But "fan". it .

must be remembered, derives from
the Word fanatic, and still retains
the essence of closed mindedness.)

Last Sunday at the Palace. the
Kinks presented an attempt at a
solution. Devoting the first forty-
five minutes of their performance to
appeasing their fans with a catalogue
of hits. they Were then free to present
their i'heftl'oeui're. Preservation. a
morality play in two acts.

With the maturation of rock
music in the late 1960's. the creation
of thematic musical pieces emerged.
beginning with the Moody Blues'
Days of Future Passed, This led to
the development of rock operas like
"Jesus Christ Superstar“ and “Tom-
my." two of the most successful of
the genre. But not all turned out this
way; many times a group attempted
the enormous undertaking of a
theatrical rock concert and failed
miserably—«either the theatrics do
not have the sophistication that
audiences have come to expect in
such productions.or the musicaland
the visual simply do not mesh
properly.

The release of Prat-criterion Arts I
& II appeared to be just another
small event in the long history of the
Kinks, another competent. well-
produced album; or. viewed in ii
larger sense. another competent
well-produced concept package.
However. their stage presentation of
