ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

 
 

DECEMBER 6, 1974

 

 

by Vinny Red:

Although haircuts are experienj
cing some new growth in America
these days. the operations of
Albany‘s campus barber shopseem V
to be nearing a cutoff. A referendum
approved by a Faculty-Student
Association board ofdirectors com-
mittee on November 25th. barely
leaves the shop a blade of hope.

The referendum calls for the
barber shop to be closed by June 30.
I975. Student Association President
Pat Curran. rtlso vice-president on
the FSA boa rd. says that a food shop
now appears to be an almost certain
successor. “Any comments that We
heard frorii students are that it is a g
fantastic idea.“ says Curran.

The barber shop‘s one chtince for I
survival would occur ifthc plans fell
through. as did original plans fora
record co-op. “We can‘t overlap the
bookstore.“ states Curran of that
case. “they‘ve got a contract.“

A food shop does not face this
problem, however. and if it. or any
other alternative. is passed at FSA‘s
February or March meetings. the
fate of tire barber shop will be closed.

Daniel Gallo. manager of the
shop. along with Ted Morrell.
one of its two barber's. has riot given
up hope to keep the shop open. “I
talked to Mr. Zahm (FSA general
manager ii. Norbert Zahm).“ ex-
plained (intro. "and he gave its sortie
assurance that the situation did not
look too bad."

Zahm concurs that “i would like

to see the committee make ii trttly
fair decision as to how much the
shop is needed by the academic com-
munity.” r

Curran. however. feels that the
community should be narrowed
down to the students. whose on-
campus mandatory meal costs
provide most ofFSA‘s revenue. “it is
the students. therefore. that FSA
should basically be directed
towards." he states.

“The barber shop loses l0.000
dollars a year and does not benefit
students enough. it is true that
check-cashing. for instance. loses
even more. bttt it does benefit
students in my opinion. In propor-
tion. students do not use the shop
that much."

Zahm adds that the barbers have a
position of their own. "They sort of

consider the shop theirs." he ex-‘

plains. “and they are certainly going
to present air optimistic outlook for
the future.“

“We were really surprised when

-.vve rciid nbotit this last week. because

we a re not doing that bad at all." says
Danny (iiitto. “We told Mr. Zahni
that i thought the percentage of
students to faculty would be about
50-50. and look.“ he says pointing to
some figures pencil-scratched upon
yellow notebook paper.

The student-faculty ration rciid
07-48 two weeks ago. 5l-2‘) for
three days last week. The barber poll
for the first days oftliis week read 1‘)-
I4. favor students.

Even Curran exprerised some sur-
prise at the percentage. "But." he
added. “you have to realize the their
are H.000 students here and only
2500 faculty. The percentage does
not outweigh its loiises."

There are rather extenuating cir-
cumstances for their losses however.
The shop hits lost about $5800 in the
pitst year. but over $3500 of that
went toward taxes itnd pension
funds for FSA workers. which other
shops Would never have to pay.

Business has picked tip of litte In
.ltily. August. and September. the
shop lost only $500. including it
$243.60 loss on the Xerox copier
outside their door which they must
pay for.

In the last fotirweeks particularly.
business has averaged $500 per. as

come in here like us.” Gatto also
points out that the shop gives a
special $5.50 wash-cut-style to
students only.

Guys- Sensitive over Barbers

Curran maintains. however. that
“the shop has not won the con-
fidence of most of the students on
campus. Guys are now pretty seri-
sitive about whom otir biirbers are. l
have found ll barber here iit Albany
to do mine one in business for
himself. ttot just providing it ser-
vice."

Yet (ititto maintains he hits “the
best following here possible.“ and he
does not mind the extra expenses.
Although he and Morrell make only
$322 neck combined. he feels the

Future." he said that he felt it "too
early to he definitive about the kind

believes that "the least gov critnient is
