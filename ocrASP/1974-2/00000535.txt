creasing work load that each clean-
ing lady has been responsible for.
They claimed that. on account of a
job freeze, whenever a personnel
member retiresor is ﬁred. no one ﬁlls
the Void. Thus two women instead of
three may have to care for the same
amount of space.

We talked to a Mr. Alrutz. who is
in charge of maintenance personnel
for the entire University, and
questioned him about the job freeze.
He said that there wasn‘t any such
freeze. and that there hadn‘t been
one for at least three years.

“We need more equipment,” was
probably the most common remark
heard from the ladies. Many com-
plained that. due to a shortage of
vacuum cleaners they had to lug
their machines up the stairways in-
stead of keeping one on each ﬂoor.
This shortage of supplies and equip-
ment is caused by both the great
amount of bathroom and cleaning
supplies stolen each year. and a tight
budget which curtails any possible
purchases of needed items.

“Non-campus people steal90%of

the stuff.” said one maintenance
supervisor. Another maintenance
ofﬁcial deplored the theft and waste
of products by students: “It would be
appreciated if the students did not
take toilet paper and scatter it over
the trees."

Most cleaning ladies. who often

have children of their own. had a r

favorable attitude toward students.
They said that many students stop
and talk with them occasionally.and
that there are “very few” slobs
around to antagonize them. (One
lady assigned to the ‘4 plus 2‘ dorm
on Indian Quad. however. labeled
the student occupants as "pigs" and

It was apologetically explained that
Dr. Rosen had contracted a

Rosen (who has been married to the
doctor for 46 years) had prepared a
short presentation on'the adventures
of her and her husband's tiay'els.

ever since the I949 Chinese revolu-

job in bringing about human dignity
and pride to 800 million people who
had previously been treated poorly.
Extraordhary Gains

Rosen noted that the medical
gains that China has attained since
its I949 liberation have been “extra -
dinary.” The main goal of Chinese
medicine as practiced today. Rosen
stated. is the “prevention of disease."
This goal is being reached she ex-
plained, as a result of careful. an-
nual. medical examinations for com-
munc inhabitants. As an example
Rosen mentioned that. “venereal
disease once rampant has been
eliminated." Other medical
achievements listed by Rosen have
been the reduction of infant monoli-
ty by more than four percent. Rosen
noted that in China there is “no such
thing as a drug problem."

DECEMBER 6, 1974

University

by Falth Schottenfeld ‘

The University Senate. for the se-
cond time this semester opench dis-
cussion on the nine bills conceming-
tenure and promotion last Monday.
For the second time. the bills didn‘t
get anywhere.

The meeting of November 4
resulted in a motion by Senator
Leibowitz to amend a section of Bill
32. which concerns reversal of prior
recommendation. Discussion of this
amendment was encumbered
because Senator Lcibowitz was not
present at that meeting to interpret
her motion. and following several
comments, Dean Holstein moved to
table the bills.

“It is ridiculous." he said. “to
move ahead in this zombie-like
fashion. I say this with great hesita-
tion; these bills represent a lot of
work and there‘s a lot ofcontent," he
continued. "But I‘m very reluctant to
proceed at this point. My sentiments
are that we should not continue until
a sizable group within the body is
prepared to pursucthc contentofthe
bills and present positive‘

a rgu ments."

He was supported by Dean
Brown. who added. “When you do
not have the'person most awareof
the reasoning b’ehind- the amend-
ment. it is advisable to postpone dis- '
cussion.” He said. however. that it is

postponement need apply to all the

Senator lgoe. attempting to ex-
plain the Senate‘s apathetic attitude.
said. "People have heard about this
so many times. it‘s old but already."
Expressing the fnrstration felt by
many members. he added. “Some of
these bills go back as far as three
years: must we go over and over
them?"

Senator Waterman. who ended-
mccting by calling for a quorum.
said. “We are not discussing this
business today. folks."

The meeting was adjourned
following a motion to recess until the
following Monday, when the Senate
will probably vote on a bill regarding
the l976-I977 Academic Calendar.

LSA T and Average are Keys .
. For Admission to Law School

by Ellen Ecleteh

Applying to law school is a long
and arduous task. The increasingly
higher competition has made accep-
tances harder than ever. Thus while
the decision to attend law school
may be easy. getting in is not.

As you begin planning to apply to
law school the question of what kind
of undergraduate background you
should have arises. Exactly what
courses you should have are hard to
determine. Albany Law School
suggests that the prc-law student ac-

quire facility in the communication
of ideas. both orally and in writing.
But as far as one‘s undergraduate
major. according to John Welsh.
Dean of Admissions at Albany Law.
it is not all that important.

“The grade point average and the
LSAT are'going to be of primary
concern." said Dean Welsh. “Weare
very concerned next with
recommendations.“ he continued.
"These three things together with
our assessment of curriculum pur-
sued. number of pass/fail courses

and work experience all are con-
sidered in a student's acceptance."
explained Dean‘Welsh.

“When you begin to think about
selecting particular law schools. you
should know that it is easiest to ﬁnd
a job in the same geographical areas
as the law school attended.” said Dr.

Jerome Fink. Pre-Law advisor at

SUNY at Buffalo.

The next thing to consider iswhen
to apply. Filing of law school
applications should be done as early
as possible: Robert Gibson. Pre-
Law advisor at this University.
suggests that applications should be
completed by January lst espec'nlly
since most law schools generally
have rolling admissions.

The second most important thing
to consider for law school is the
LSAT. "You only plan to take the
LSAT once since law schoolsdcduct
for repreating the exam." explained
Gibson. Headvisesthattheexambe
taken in July before the senior year
or October of one‘s senior year. The
best preparation book for the law
boards. according toa survey in Buf-
falo by Dr. Fink. istheone bySimon '
and Schuster while the Cowlcs book
is generally considered useless. As.
far as guide books to law school Gib—
son suggeststhe Pro-Law Handbook
published by the Association of
American Law Schools and the Law
School Admissions Council.

“You‘ve got to demonstrate
academic competence because com-
petition is so keen," said Dean
Welsh. But Gibson explained that
the national grade inﬂation is the
reason for higher averages required
and not the number ofapplications.
He noted that there was not much
change in the number of students
applying to law school in the past
two years. “According to all reports
we have hit a plateau (in
upplications).“ Gibson claimed.

The reasons why some choose law
school are as varied as the students
themselves. While all plan to he
lawyers this does not necessarily
mean that they will practice law.
Some use it as a stepping stone for a
political career. “Being a lawyer
would be combining several lrilierests
l have." commented one El dent.
'Another felt that she would like to
work with juveniles. While a third
student expressed an interest in con-,
sumcr protection.

When asked whatadvicc he would
give a perspective law student. Gib-
son repl'tcd: "You can‘t decide the
chances of getting into law school
solely on the basis of scores and
averages. You never know what is
going to get your admission." Gib-
son felt that students were more
pessimistic than'they ought 'to be
about getting into law school. As a
student leaves his office Gibson
would offer one’la'st piece of advice. -'
.“Good Luck!"
