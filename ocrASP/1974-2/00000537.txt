‘ Central Council's passage of a bill to prohibit the housing of students in lounges
I to' discourage tripling in rooms was a step in the rightdireetion. Caging ten students in
' a room that was built for relaxation and addingan extra student to a small cubbyhole

violates the amount of personal space an individual requires.

Whilei we might have a reasonable and fair Administration, they drag their feet when
it comes to money. Student Association contends that “unofficial sources on the
residence staff" indicate that residency will rise to l20 %of capacity. Yet Director of

. Residence .lohn Welty called the ﬁgure a "rumor." explaining that'the school will only
* be at 101 % capacity. Whom are we to believe?

Should we accept the statistics of a ResidenceOfﬁce that was amazed and pleasantly
shocked at a well over l00 % residency this year? The University wants to guard itself
against being under-occupied; thus studentsmust be herded together like cattle. Since
the Administration generally downplays embarrassing statistics, Student

Association's l20 % statistic is probably more accurate.

In light of Albany's new housing law that limits the number of non-related people
living together to three. there will probably be more students living on-campus next
year. Many students will not'be able to make up the difference from their four, five. or

six man dwelling to a three person apartment.

Instead of having to rely on Vice-President for Management and Planning John
Hartley‘s complacent statement that the housing situation “will work itself out.‘
Administrators should take some steps to ensure that students will have acceptable

housing accommodations.

. . . In A Confrontation

When Stony Brook administrators saw an ad in the campus newspaper (The
Statesman) yesterday calling for a sit-in at their administration building they
probably remembered what they’ve been reading these past few years about student

apathy and the decline of activism». So they didn‘t put a string of policemen around the
building to stop the demonstration. and though they threatened arrests they haven‘t
made any.

Student Activism is a tool. developed by students across the nation during'the
l960's. It reached a high point during the spring of‘70 in reaction tothe horror ofKent

State and the blind madness of the Cambodialnvasion .Campuses since then have been

quiet. in some cases because some demands were met, in others because of frustration
and despair. or maybe because a new selfishness credo was sparked by the world‘s

, economic turn. But as events at Stony Brook make clear. students still use thistool in

protecting their rights.

During the “Spring Wars" of‘70, Colonial's flagroom was burnt out completely the
day of the Kent State killings. WindOWs were broken and the school year terminated
early. Since then Albany State students have used the activism tool rather intelligently.
In May ‘73 students expressed their disgust for the tenure system and the immoral,
egotistical. illegal and academically destructive actions ofthe former Dean of Arts and
Sciences l. Moyer Hunsbergcr. Pl RG (Public Interest Research Group) has also used
the tool in the past year.

The techniques of confrontation and peaceful obstruction have been somewhat
bypassed by quiet increases of student power at this University. But recently the trend
appears to be reversing. There are rumblings within SUNY Central about limiting
student representation on FSA boards to one-third: considering FSA‘s operations are
almost entirely student-related. our present fifty percent is low. Housing
administrators seem unconcerned about conditions here. students may lose their
academic voice. and the tenure system still pays little attention to student opinions. We
are part ofthe University. indeed we are the purpose ofthe University and we have the
right to a large voice in its decisions. We should be prepared to exercise our dormant
tool of demonstration again.

Oh Well, I Didn't Want It Anyway

 

WASHINGTON—«Eighteen years ago the
only presidential candidate ever to visit
Southern Pines. North Carolina laid himself
down on the living room floor in the home ofa
friend and — attired in sneakers. slacks. sport
shirt and v-neck sweater—allowed as how he
wasn‘t sure he wanted the presidency badly
enough.

He was it man who. by all accounts. sought
his own counsel. thought his own thoughts.
wrote his own speeches and spoke his own
words. The rigors of campaigning. he said.
simply didn‘t allow him enough time to be
alone. to think. to do justice to thecltallcnge.

‘ ‘ for I976 said publicly what Adlai
li. Stevenson. .lr. had said privately many
years before. and to just ahottt everybody's
astonishment withdrew frortt the presidential
race. Suid its aide to Sen. Walter F. Mondale
(l)—Minn.). I guess lie just “didn‘t \Vtttll to
spend the next two years living itt Holiday

Not to cast tispcrsions upon the Senator‘s
candor —certttinly two years slinviiig irt front
of Ilolidtty Inn mirrors is a peculiarly
tliscourugit‘tg prospch -thrcc other cqtittlly
persuasive reasons for his dropping out conic
to mind.

First. being the front runner iii the
upcoming 26-stute Dctttocrrttic primary circus
is tantamount to slicing your wrists and
jumping irtto shark-infested writers. More
than courting disaster. it is heating it soundly
iibotit the face and Itioirtli to get its attention.

iSccontl. even if there were it prayer of
surviving the sharks. Mondale docs itot litth
rind probably could Itot get enough money to
stay afloat throughout tltc rrttrrnthon. Nor. for

candidate. The Democrats simply haven‘t

the first time in 24 years.

And so. without spending any morc nights
iti Holiday Inns. the man who doesn't want the
presidency badly enough may still ltavc as
good a chance in l976as did Adlai Stevenson.
the man whodidn‘t want it tttall. in I952. It is
itot likely that that fact has escaped Mondalc‘s
attcntion entirely.

No ncthclcss. the Senator‘s stated reason for

just rid ourselves of a man who tltc facts show
wanted the presidency rtitrclt too badly. In his
slcud we have it man who didn‘t seek it til all
and who. so ftrr. hasn't ltown much indication
tlittt he knows what to no with it. And now \vc
httvc a man who says: Yes. it would be all right
to be president. but lgucss ljust don't want it
badly enough. Somehow. that‘s got it nice.
balanced ring to it. particularly iii view of the
fact that the man isnot ultogctltcr unqualified.

llut no sooncrhud Mondale pronounced his
decision than runny of my colleagues were
saying: Altnl 'l'lttit proves it: We‘re putting our
candidates through too ntuch physicnl and
mental abuse. rtttrking them run around for
two years before tltc elections.

Well. maybe. You‘vc,got to bcii little wacky

there‘s sortie merit to making them do it
together and in ftill ptrblic view rind for a long

Whether that means 26 state primtirics or
