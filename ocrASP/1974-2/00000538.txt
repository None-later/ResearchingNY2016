 Asch stmastide approaches some of you may

‘ perhaps think of the Roman festival which occurred in

December. the Saturnalia. in honor of the old Italic
vegetation god Saturn. Much of the merrymaking which

character. as well as a Roman poet. who should come to
mind. The legendary character is the Sibyl. a prophetic
priestess of Apollo. himself the god of prophecy. The
poet is Vergil. . '
'l'heorigin of the name Sibyl is not entirely certain. In
early times it seems to have been the name of an in-
dividual. and later became generalized with the meaning
“prophetic priestess."_ Legend recounts that once there
was only one Sibyl. who wandered from place to place.
In any case. there is solid evidence for an ancient belief in
the existence of several Sibyls. each associated with a

times.

different locality. The Christian author Laetantius '(4th

century AD.) lists ten Sibyls. telling something speciﬁc
about each one. and giving every indication lhatlhe
believed they had once existed. This list. as Lactantrgs
himself stutes. is taken from the writings of the Roman
scholar Vrirro. who lived long before the period of Lac-
tantius.

Thanks to Vergil the Sibyl who is reputed to have lived
at Cumae. a Greek colony in southern Italy. is the one
best known today. In his epic. the Aeneid. the hero
Aeneas. the ancestor of the Romans. visits the
Cumuean Sibyl to inquire about his destiny and that of
his descendants in Italy. It is. however. Vergil‘s Fourth
Et'loguo which is primarily responsible for the associa-
tion ofthe Sibyl and Christmas. In this Eclogtte Vergil
dcclrires that the era foretold in the prophecies of the
Sibyl is at hand and that a child is about to be born who
will bring peace to the world and confer great blessings
upon mankind. The identity ol‘tlie child. if Vergil was
thinking of ii real child. has never been satisfactorily
determined. But since the poem was written in the same
general period. the Aligustrin Age. iii which Jesus was
borti. the belief ﬂourished among Christians that Vergil
was predicting the birth ofthe Christ Child. Though this
interpretation has now been completely refuted. one can
hardly fail to be startled by the remarkable similarity
between the language of the Furtth Et'logtte and that of
parts of the prophecies of Isaiah.

lit the Middle Acs and the Renaissance the belief in
both Vergil and the Sibyl its prophets of the birth of
Christ was very strong. In a mediaeval Christmas play
entitled Prop/turtle "The I’rup/tt‘lr" Vcrgil and the Sibyl
appear among the prophets of the Old 'l‘estrtmctu who
foretold the coming of Christ. 0n the floor of the
cathedral of Sienn there are beautiful black and white
mosaics dcpiclittg various Sibyls. They would never
have been there had it not been for Vergil‘s Futtrt/t
lz‘t-lrtgttt'. Well known to many. especially to art
histoiinns and lovers of art. are the paintings of the
Sibyls by Michelangelo iii the Sistine Chapel.

To students of ancient religion.
literature. and mythology the Greek
god Dionysus. also known ll.
Bacchus and. to the Romans. as
Liber. poses many interesting,
questions. He has many of the
aspects of a fertility god. but really
represents all the unrestrained forces
of nature and of human passions.
His female attendants were the
Macnads or “frenzied ones." It is
generally believed that he was a late
addition to the Greek pantheon,
although this view has recently been
challenged. Euripides made him the
subject of the lust of his plays. the
Barr/me. which in the opinion of
sortie is also his most beautiful one.
Of the many myths which are told
about Dionysus the one about hil
birth is perhaps the strongest and
shall be retold here.

King of the Greek city of Thebes; he

“I thought last night was terrific. I

you werejust great. I mean. wellyou

She nodded silently. knowingthat
he had much more to say. She wasn‘t
sure what it was. btit she knew it was
not her turn to speak.

“This morning I stiirted thinking
about what we did. and on thcdrivc
here I thought about nextyeur.what
lwtint todo. That‘s been on my mind
iIII semester. rind it's really been
bothering me. l was thinking that
there was too much on my mind to
get involved with you." She sat up.
and her eyes widened.

“I think I‘ve also been afraid to
trust anybody. to open tip to them.

said. Ididn‘l letitﬁffcct me. It wasn‘t

talking to them I became very
cynical about what they had said."
He paused here. not sure if what he
was saying meant tinythingto her. or
if he was getting his point across.

"Hut you wercdiffereut. lfelt itthe

couldn‘t hack anything like that
then. and since then I‘ve been
avoiding anything like that.” Adam's
shoulders slumped. ‘it was like a
balloon deﬂating.

Evelyn saw his reaction and
hurried up what she had to say.

“No. Adam. Don‘t get upset.
Listen. I want to try something real
and deep again. And I want to do it
with you.“ He immediately sprung
up. and wrapped his arms around
her.

“Oh. Evelyn. That‘s fantastic. It
really is. It really is.

She bounced off the ground and
grabbed his hand. dragging him to
his feet. She was off and running
before he stood up. He run after her.
btit she had it headstart. and she rrtn
dnmn fast. A hundred yardslritcr. he
caught up with her.

“Hey.” Ire printed. slowly catching
his breath. "You sure ruti fast.“

“I was on tile girls‘ track team last

again. He pushed harder this titnc.
and .n by her with a wave of his
hand. She grilled her teeth and pur-

noticed she couldn‘t find hitn. Where

“Hello. How are you?“ he said
quietly. She spun around iii histtrtns.
and slipped hers around his neck.

“Kiss me." she said. Hecomplied.

They left the park as it was getting

He looked up. and before he saw

fall on the ground about ten feet
away. His arms were grabbed and
pinned behind him. Adam thought
quickly.and pushed back. slamming
