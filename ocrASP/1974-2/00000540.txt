Return to Forever

Like so manyja'zz-rock musicians.
Chick Corea has played on
numerous albums. as a contributing
musician (examples-wMiles Davis.
Larry ,Coryell.‘ and Herbie Mann).
Inevitably. Chick had to form his-
own band. to use as his own Vehicle
oi' musicalexprcssion; hence. Return
tti l-‘orevcr.

Led by Chick‘s keyboards. RTF is
tilled out by Al DiMeoltt on gtiitar »
(he replaces Bill Conners) , Lenny
White on drums. and StanlcyClarke
on bass. a founding member.

Return to Forever is tiiiiisiial in

drums and the guitar provide

tlie collaboitttinn ol' these two men.
and their interaction with the other
two members of the grniip. it is easy

to understand why they and the
group ltave won so ntany musical
awards.

The new album ll’lit-ri' Iltll't' l
ly‘noim You liq/ore is a comment on
the state of a rt ol‘tlieja'iz-rock music
scene today. Return to Forever is
playing the same style found on
many other contemporary. Miles
Davis inl'lueiiecd groups. The major
musical dil'l'eience since their last
album is. the replacement ol'
guitarist Bill Conners with Al

cmplil'ies this new style' of. bass -
player: he has done some of his best
work with Corea and RTF.

Climax Blues Band

l'he Climax Blues Band‘s new
album. Some o/'l)irt'i'limi. is led by,
the song. “Aiiiei‘ite, Sense of Direc-
tion“ it Iiicli is ll masterpiece. Alone.
this song is worth the price of the
album. it is last driving rock. with
excellent lead guitar work by Peter
llaycock.

()nee past this sting. (which will
take about an hour]. the rest oftlie
album contains sc\t.‘l‘ttl other points
oi interest. “Nogalcs". “Reaching
out" and ‘ltight Non" are all songs
that could be tlirouii together tinder
tlieheading "Country-Blues Rock."
but their appeal is inticli wider than
this uotild suggest.

Iliei'e is a certain audience that
has already been captured by the
limited iaiige ol grottps like the
/\lllllllll Brothers atid the (ii'atet'ul

extended thqnselve'iignd have
profited from it.

Genesis «

Not your ordinary. run-oi-the-
mill group. Genesis does not
produce your ordinary. run-of-the-

mill album. Continuing in their'

grand. unorthodox manner. their
newest release. The Lamb Lies
Down On Bram/tray is a testament
to a new high of art in music of a
limit now being given more and
more popular attention.

Yes. there‘s a' story here
somewhere. hidden along‘th‘eﬂcon-
voluted path of checri'uliihiantiy
carved out by Peter Gabriel. lead
singer & songwriter.

Musically. The Luiiih'Lies' Down
on Broadway is Genesis‘ most
satisfying album to date. There is a
definite continuity of instrumental
themes throughout all four sides of
the album. rendering the division
ittto songs more an arbitrary separa-
tion of lyric and melody ru'therthan
a hard and last boundary.

It is given life through thclvocals
and little of Peter Gabriel. the bass
and twelve stringol‘ Michiiel Ruther-
i‘ord.the keyboards of Tony Banks.
tlte giiita rs ol'Steve llackett. and the
percussion. Hiring and voicing of
Phil Collins. l'Iiere is also a slight
tinge of "liiiossil‘ieation" to the
albttiii Brian lino was bound to
pop in sooner or later,

In \iett ol' the large amount of
uriticii material included with the
album. built the liner notesand the
lyrics the mttsic almost seems to be
relegated to the background. simply

stands tip on itsown astt fine piece oi
