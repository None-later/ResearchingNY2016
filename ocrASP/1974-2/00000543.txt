TheSUNYA [student car pool effort. which
began the'Iast week of September. has

‘ performed poorly due to laelr of student

interest. 0f the roughly three thousand ear
owning commuters. only twenty-six‘filled
applications disphying an interest. In the face
of criticitm about the lack of student activism
these ﬁgures do nothing to deny the existence
of widespread student apathy.

From the twenty-six applications that were
ﬁlled two car pools were started involving a
total of six commuters. Seven other applicants
were in the process of forming pools but it is
not yet known whether they have begun
operating.

In many cases a students from one area
would fill out an application and no other
commuters from nearby would sigrl up. In
other instances there would be several
students from one area displaying an interest
but their time schedules were so different that
they couldn't conceivably car pool. It is for
these reasons that a large turnout was needed
for a successful car pooling program—
SUNYA commutersapparently had other
things on their minds.

Those commuters who did fill out
applications are to be thanked for their

' l1 r
concern. Unfortunately not all applicants
Were able to join pools. but th‘oTsewho did are
reaping the rewards of having to‘psy less at the
gas pumps. In addition,extra thanksare to be
given to , those several students who are
sacrificing a little convenience in order to
participate in a pool. If all commuters were
like those few, we would all be breathing is
little easier.

An Additional Comment: The
American
by Lawrence Pub!

The ad ministration's stubborn insistence on
a voluntary energy conservation program‘
highlightsa basic flaw in the American psyche,
mainly, theaverage American's ability to react
only in times of real. tangible crisis. Like the
proverbial ostrich, we hide our heads in the
sands of the current energy limbo between
crisis and catastrophe. From the Frog's
Mouth suggests we stop kidding ourselves—
wc either conserve now of face economic
consequences for greater in impact through
increased dependence on foriegn sources. We
have serious energy problems which need
strong federal programs—not a dependence
on the Ostrich-American.

They're aliens. you know. Sure, sure, there
was a big piece on it this month in Popular

Science. It'svstill on the stands. if you're,

interested. But in any event, it's a fact that.

‘ Finals are extra-terrestrial forces.

It‘ makes sense when you think about it.
Look at what they can do. Several times a
year. they systematically invade the minds of
the world's brightest and take over to the point
where there's little else to talk about. Every
year! And you never noticed it. Wake Up!

Amazing. There's not one person in high
position in this country today who has not

been occupied by the Finals. What did they

Finals do to these people during these weeks
their minds were replaced? _

The awesome power to be able to
completely jumble one's priorities,
supplanting yourself as Number One on the

"list‘J‘.".'“excuse me, the phone. . .

. . . That was my lawyer. He was just reading
this and he says that l have to tell the truth. So
here it is: I made up that whole Finals story.
Yeah. I know. I‘m sorry in led you on,.but I
wanted to make a point.

All this garbage of putting Finals ahead of
yourself is ridiculous. Really. I remember
back to eighth grade when I got really worried
for a few days over a test. which seemed the
most important thing in the world at the time.
It was on Homer‘s Oddessy. Now I look back.
and my concern was absurd.

And in tenth. The Red Badge of Courage.

Dear Mom and Dad.

I’m probany going to have to drop out of
school. In a way I kinda want to leave,
anyway. I‘m thinking of getting married.

I met __(Fill in name of a sterotypically

my __ (insert genital name here). and ._
(she/he) was getting a penicillin injection.
Said something about seeing Phyllis.

‘__.(bethrothed's name) is __
(Blk/Wht/ Lat/Eski) and I want you to know
that. It doesn't bother me one bit and I don't
think anyone at the synagogue will care. If it
makes you feel any better, _. (she/ helwill

We get along so well. and _ (she/he‘s)

I think _ (she‘s/ I‘m) pregnant.

Well, I have to run now. I‘m due at the
