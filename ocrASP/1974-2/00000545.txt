‘The preseason ‘rundo n has the

Orient Danes basicallyrset. It is a
talented squad with several excep-
tional individuals and the team is
backed by a strong bench. As it
appears now, however, Saturday's
opener'could be a great deal closer
then was expected. . .
lnju ries have struck the Danesand
struck them hard. It certainly seems
that that key factor ofdepth is going
to be playing an earlier role in the
squad's success than Coach Garcia
had expected. _

In the I58 lb. class. veteran Tom
Horn is out with an ankle sprain.
Coach Garcia expressed hope that
Tom would be back in action versus
Cortland, which is this Wednesday.
Garcia‘s most probable choice, as a
Saturday fill-in for Horn. is Rick
Robbins.

A second ankle sprain was suf-

fered by C(l-Cllpltllll Doug Bauer, -

who wrestles in the 167'Ib. class.
Bauer. who was being counted on to
Itold down this division, most likely
won‘t see action again until the
(iencseo match next Saturday.

In the I77 lb. weight classification
probable starter Rick Lawrence is
out with a neck sprain. A date for
Rick‘s rctum was questionable so
.lack Ambrosio will probably be
moved into his spot.

When asked why the sttddcn rash
of injuries. Coach (ia rcia felt that the
primary contributing factor was the
lack of sufficient heat in the wrestl-
ing room. Naturally without the

‘ 9 several other Albany grapplers that

defeated Dartmouth 33-6 and RPI‘
36-3 last year. another adverse cir-
cumsttincé forState to reckon with is

'the results of the Thanksgiving

recess. Coach Garcia revealed that
he may end up shiftingsome weights
due to the fact that some ofthe guys
came back a bit overweight and not
quite as sharp due to the layoff.

As it stands right now. the varsity
has just completed its wrestle-offs to
see who the definite starters will be
tomorrow. Garcia feels.evcn though .

 Several'starte’rs are lost, RPland
Dartmouth will still have to face

could present a healthy degree of dif-
ficulty (i.c. Mims. Vido. Mion etc.).
Looking past tomorrow‘s match.

Albany has two dual meets next

week against Cortland Wednesday
evening M7130 and an away match
against Geneseo on Saturday. Over
the holidays the team will be corn-
pcting in the M.|.T. Tournament in
Boston on Dec; 28.

Also. for those interested. a
wrestling clinic will be conducted by
the team prior to tomorrow‘s match
in the gym. starting at l2:30.

Wrestling Clinic

Wrestling has long been a popular
college sport. However. many peo-
ple have never been exposed to
wrestling and do not understand
what it is all about. To remedy this
situation. the Albany State wrestling
team will hold a wrestling clinic
tomorrow prior to their Rl’l/Dart-
mouth match to introduce everyone
to the sport.

The clinic will consist of all facets
of wrestling. Terminology will be ex-
plained. including how scoring
works. Studentswill be able to watch
the wrestling team demonstrate
holds. takedowns. reversals and
pins. 'the clinic will start at l2:30 in
the main gym. and the entire un-
iverstiy eomtnttnity is invited to
watch and Icam.
