Imprisonment Here and There

continued from page 7/1
and discovered that the place looked
just'us bad in the light as it did in the
dark. The room in which we spent
our time when weweren‘t in ourcells
(theday room) wasabout twenty feet
long eight feet wide. with a tableand
bench running the length of the bars.
This left about a three foot clearance
for walking. Now in Nassau, the
width was the same. but is was much
longer because you had only one
man in a cell. Imagine. this place was
half the size of a tier in Nassau and
held twice as many people.

Breakfast was brought in and it
consisted of one egg. a half strip of
bacon, a biscuit and a cup of black
coffee. lcouldn't even eat all of this
because Hound a long strand of hair
in the eggs. I couldn't take a shower
because the water ran in~a steady
drip. The ' place was completely
segregated and truthfully I don‘t
know why the Board of Health
didn't close it down.

Now the thing's that intrigued me
about this place was. as I said before.

no matter how far they had come.
you could only talk to them for ten
minutes through a glass in the wall
with a voice box under it. and this
was only on Saturday and Sunday.
Medical attention. you had to be
damn near dying to get. A typical
case. a guy who was in there with me
. had the clap. He had to complain for
seven days before he got to see a doc—
tor. Recreation. there was none. All

we had to do was sititround and look
at each other all day. With all this,
would you believe they charged me
three dollars a day for everyday I
stayed there? Well they did and it
had to be paid. Rather than continue
I‘ll just say that when I Went from
Nortlt Carolina to Alabama cori-
ditions went from very bad. to much
worse. So how can a prisoncrin New
York complain?

 

 

they letme keep my own clothesand »

money. and more of these could be
brought to you. In this jail we had
what we called a turnkey or a trustee.
This guy was a prisoner just like
everyone else. But! In the morning
you could give this guy money and
he would go outside of the jail to a
store and buy whatever you wanted
besides alcohol. Any time after this
yoii could call this guy and give him
money and he would go to the ven-
ding machines insidc thejail and buy
you sodas and potato chips. This guy
also had the keys to all the doors
which he was responsible for open-
ing and closing.

Genesis Litres:  on

by Spence RIgglo
and Matt Kaufman

From the one-shot. three mintite
melodies of the ﬁfties and sixties. to
the ninety minute. complex,
thematic “opera.” rock has been
slowly approaching a sort of musical
maturity. Now instead of simply
judging a song on its basic lyrical and
melodic content. there is the added
aesthetic value and satisfaction of
the conceptual relationships and
repetitivo themes that are found in a
concept album.

The Lamb Lies Down on
Broadway is Genesis‘ first fully
realized and wholly successful
attempt at a concept album. Unlike
other such works. wherein the intent
is to create either a certain feeling. a
state of mind. or Illi atmosphere.
lamb is an album with It plot. and is
presented by Genesis. as a story by
Peter Gabriel.

The stage is dark. Suddenly. il-
luminated by a single light. the
shadow of(iuhric| in long robe. thin

Street. sucked in Manhattan Island.
and the hero of the story. named

dcrground. lhis is his story. . . “

Thick clouds of smoke billow up
from the stage. its njcaned. 'l'-shirtcd

All based on a dream of Gabriel‘s.

another. The helpless hero is dragg-

sides of the album). But when
presented live. Lamb isdivided more
naturally into three parts.

The ﬁrst chapter serves as an in-
troduction. Highly dependent upon
lyrics. with a minimal amount of
jamming. the two major
characters—Rae! and his brother
John—are presented here as the
scene is set for action.

Throughout the show. scenery is
provided by three rear projection
screens upon which an imaginative
slide show appears. Photos of The
City, animation. drawings. and pain-
tings by Dali and Magritte are
employed in the creation of a
suitable atmosphere.

“ . . .this particular sequence of
events takes our hero to the
notorious streets of New York City.
which have been almost perfectly
reconstructed below the surface of
the ground. From this he moves to
recollections of his first amotirous
adventure. . .hc fails dismully to
arouse his partner. and is left
cuddling his very own prickly por-
cupine. He moves on to a thick.
carpeted corridor with kneeling peo-
ple obsessively moving to a chamber
with thirty-two doors. only one of
which will take them out . . 

It seems at this point llSlfCVtHl Mr.
(inbricl has lost track of the plot. No
matter though. for this portion of the
adventures of Rucl hold no really
significant information with regard
to the story. Part flashback. part
comic relief, and part confused sym-
Illolism. a lot of looscjumniing here is
held together with it lot of loose
lyrics.

Though it may be self-indulgent
digression. this section does prodttcc
two ol'thc bestsongs on thculbam#
“black in NYC" and “Carpet
Crawlers." The lead in to “Ilack in
N YC" is a single pulsating bass note
in four quarters, the beat of the

human heart, the rhythm of nature.
It’s abasic rhythm pattern for Lamb.
serving as a foundation for the many
unusual meters Genesis is known
for.

Onstage. Michael Rutherford
plays a rare twin-necked guitar. a six
string with a six string bass. which
means that Genesis lacks a full time
bassist. So they try to make up forit.
Rutherford plays bass pedals while
on rhythm guitar. but there are
moments when depth is sacrificed.

“A light approaches. a light of in-
creasing brightness. at which Rael is
overcome by fear. but he picks up a
stone and hurls it toward the center
of the light. There is a big crash, the
ceiling frills. and he's trapped in a
heap of rubble. This provides him
with theopportunity to meet his own
personal hero. His hero comes from

the same people who brought you

the Texas Chain Saw Massacre and
'I'hrcc-On-A-Mcathook; he‘s better

knownhdelth..." r
Racl's back on the‘track of the

story. and the lyrics tighten up along .

with the music. There is extensive
jamming here. something Genesis
does well. and Peter Gabriel puts
down the microphone for a while to
help out on ﬂute and percussion.
“. . .then Rael is sensually
assaulted by three half snake/half
women called Lamia—and I‘m
delighted to see we haven few in the
audience tonight—which he finishes
off by eating. This of course turns
him into an ugly. bumpy. lumpy.
stumpy. humpy species of humanity.
not totally dissimilar from our

There is also a greater reliance on
