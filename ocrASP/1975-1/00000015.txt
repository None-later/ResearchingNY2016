Big/Eye Syndrome Hurts FSA I  _ am.

by Andrea Henberg I

“Their eyes are bigger than their
stomachs and they‘re spoiled. Ifthey
don't get exactly what they want.
they throw it out.“ says Bob
’I'oussaint. student and 3 year
veteran of FSA,as hetackles the next
tray. Untouched knockwurst. two
halffull glasses of coke and a ﬁstful
of napkins get dumped into the
Somat disposal unit.

State Quad‘s lunch time disposal
crew is one man short this particular
Saturday. Waste is coming down the
conveyor belt faster than they can
dump it. Two hamburgers. 3 hot-
dogs. two untouched chocolate pud-
dings riding the same tray plus
seemingly countless numbers of dis-
carded buns and napkins arcthrown
away withing two minutes time.

“And believe me. that‘s nothing,“
says Bob. “Last night I threw away
plates of roast beef. There‘s nothcr-
ing wrong with that meat. Knowing
the world‘s food situation. it's hard
to understand this.“ Bob. who is
thinking of entering the priesthood.
is concerned with the apparent in-
difference ofSUNYA studentsto the
growing food crisis.

Iiob thinks that because students
are sitttated in an atmosphere of
abundance they caneasily have an at-
litttde which says “I paid for it
anyway. I have a right to take it and
if i don‘t want it I‘ll just throw it
out." He wisltes it were possible for
them to rcali/e that there are people
who must sun we on a mere bowl of
mush a day. He suggested a loud
consciousness day’ in which eaclt
slttdent would go 24 hours with a
bowl oi mttsit to sustain him.

Another I'SA employed student
said that when he asked students
w by they threw ottt untouched por-
tions they said they didn‘t know it

have necessitated certain waste
precautions. These include taking
sugar off the tables and having to ask
for cereal instead of taking it
yourself. “We want you to have as
much as you want. as long asyou eat
it.“ says Clough.

Although there is an improvement
over last year both Clough and
Tarullo also agree that there is still
unnecessary waste. Chef Tarullo

says that often students take a lot
more than they can ﬁnish the ﬁrst
time throught the line so as not to
face the inconvenience of having to
go up later.

“There is a state health law
prohibiting the return of anything.
even sealed packages of cereal. to the
main supply. after it has been taken."
explained Clough. “Once it is on the
belt. forget it!”

Birds, Bees, and Gorillas;
Machine Stumps Soviets

(ZNS) Fog and cold weather have dashed another attempt by zoo keepers

in Sacramento. Califomia. to turn two naive gorillas into lovers.

Su/ie and Chris have been in captivity since their births. zoo officials
explain. and don‘t know the first thing about sex or mating.

So the mo imported an educational film from Switrerland which
illustrated in living color the sex habits of gorilla tribes.

their plan to show hard core Ilics to the reluctant pair was foiled several
times when Chris and Suzie found the movie projector much more interesting
titan sex I'tlms. On a third attempt to arouse the gorillas. rain and fog shut
down the private screening once again.

(Z NS) American Soviet detente sometimes has its pitfalls. The Soviet
publication the [_ilt'l‘tli‘_l‘ (l'rl:t'llt' reports that Moscow business enterprises
have been stuck with a piece of expensive American machinery that no one

knows what to do with.

The Maﬁa Mystique. by Dwight
C. Smith. Jr.. will be published, of:
ﬁcially by Basic Books. New York.
on Thursday accompanied by a
number of extremely favorable ad-
vance reviews. Mr. Smith is Director
of Institutional Research at

SUNYA.
Writing in the The New York
Times. Christopher Lehmann-

Haupt described the work as a
“scholarly study of crime imagery in
20th Century ,America.” He comv
mentcd furt er. “But more impor-
tant than its persuaveness. Mr.
Smith's thesis seems useful. For. as
he argues. so long as we perceive
organized crime as an alien con-
spiracy. we are not going to get at its
real causes. So long as we imagine
exotic enemies in our midst. we are
almost bound to run the risks with
our legal system that produced
Watergate."

Francis AJ. lanni. Director.
Horace Mann-Lincoln lnstitutc.and
author of A Family Business and
Black Malia. wrote. “Mr. Smith‘s

' the Mafia mystique is for the best

    

description of the de
compendium and snslysis'of the
literature to date.” _ “

Among other tributes to the work -
is John Camett‘s: “An excellent!
book. based on solid empirical dots.
Greatly superior to the existing 5
literature on ethnicity and omniud
crime." Dr. Cammett is Provonsnd
Dean of Faculty at John .IayCollegs
of Criminal Justice.

Mr. Smith‘s book details the
development of the “MITI- Mysti-
que“ and explains how a peculiar
blend of hidden motives and sen-
sational reporting created the public
fascination with the idea ofa secret
criminal society. According to the
author. the hard-boiled novel, Con-
gressional committees. the press.
and the movies have contribulted to
the Maﬁa Image.

Mr. Smith joined SUNYA's ad-
ministrative staffin I966. and is also
a Visiting Associate Professor of
Police Scrence at John JayCollege.
