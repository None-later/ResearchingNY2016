ReadyOr Not,

Welcome to the second semester of the ASP s magazine section. Now
called ASPects/we hope the magazine will continue to serve you with
unusual, entertaining and informative articles of all styles and formats. We'll
always welcome contributions from students, faculty, or any other member
of the University community.

About the cover:

It is unfortunate that our main story. ‘ (Gay Like Me) 1 must be labeled
"anonymous", but it is necessary to protect the author in light of the
prevailing attitudes in our society. Today's cover illustrates what life may be
like for many homosexuals in a world abundant in prejudice. Maybe
someday there will be no reason to hide one’s true sexual feelings; it seems
that we are moving that way.

Toilet Talk

by Neil Kenduck
briskly walked down the
I corridor and swung open the
bathroom door only to find two
urinals that were both occupied. I
entered a toilet stall, closed the door
behind me, and commenced the
primordial process of urinary
excretion. - I, stood impatiently,
glancing at the walls surrounding me.
They were almost completely covered
with writing—pictures, limericks,
epigrams, and quotations. I began to
read some of the scribble; “If you voted
for Nixon, you can‘t shit here—your
asshole is in San Clemente." I started
to shake uncontrollany with laughter.
When I regained my composure, I
looked down and noticed that I had left
a sizeable yellow pool in the leftcorner
of the toilet stall. I nervously zipped my
fly and turned to the door. But before I
could reach for the latch, l collided
With a boldly inscribed message on the
door: "Our aim is to keep this
bathroom clean—your aim will help!"
That night I thought about the vast
display of graffiti. lt amazed and
puzzled me. What motivated people to
do this? Did the writings have any
significance, or were the walls merely
treated as one big adult coloring book?
[wanted answers to these questions. I
decided to scrap my original
communications project in favor of
researching bathroom graffiti.

Although bathroom graffiti was a far
cry from the celebrated pie—historic
cave drawings, it would be a hell of a
lot more interesting to research. Very
little material was written about the
subject, so I decided to use the
contents of the bathrooms on campus
as my major resource. I called a girl
friend and asked her if she would help
me with my research by covering the
toilet stalls in the women's bathrooms.
She laughed for a while and then
consented.

Within two weeks, my friend and I
had gathered enough samples for the
project. lspent several weeks studying
the collected data and I arrived at
some very interesting and revealing
observations. I realized what
motivated people to write in the toilet
stalls. Graffiti is an expression of inner
drives, needs, and impulses that are
not presented through formal avenues
of communication. What is written on
the walls would not appear in a
newspaper, on a radio, or in formal
conversation because of restrictive
cultural norms. The toilet stall affords
people a confidence of privacy and
security that no other public place can.

However, it is not just a matter of
seclusion that fosters graffiti. Few
people write on the walls of the toilets
in their own homes. l concluded that
graphical expression on the walls of
public toilet stalls is unique in that it is

meant to be both private and public at
the same time. Hiswritten contribution
will be on public display for all who
follow his occupancy of the toilet stall.

Because the toilet stall offers both
privacy and publicity, the writer can
communicate his ideas to society in
ways which would be considered
taboo by other forms of media.

Much of the content leaned toward
sexual perversion and vulgar
profanity. The women's toilet stalls
were no exception to this observation.
Although I found sexual obscenity

most prevalent, harsh racistgratfiti was
almost as widely displayed in the
men's stalls, (very little racist graffiti
was found in the women's
bathrooms—their forte was strictly
sexual perversion). Most of the racist
graffiti was anti—black in sentiment.

-A most interesting point is that little
racial friction appears outside of the
bathroom walls. Although the campus
does not have an air of complete racial
harmony, there seems to be a sense of
mutual respect between the students of
different races. There are barely any
When I
questioned several black and white
students about the existing racial
situation, their remarks were to the
effect that things "weren't good,
weren't bad, but cool." Obviously,
there is a sharp contradiction between
the exterior attitudes of the students
and the implications of the bathroom
graffiti.

Before last year's "Parents’
Weekend", at the university, the
janitors were ordered to wash off the
graffiti in the bathrooms. During that
time, I visited one supposedly clean
toilet stall and found "E.O.P. niggers
eat shit" written across the wall and
untouched by cleanser. Underneath
this statements, were several replies in
defense of black students which were
mostly washed over and barely
legible. This evidences the presence
of obstacles of communication in the
toilet stalls.

Like all graffiti, bathroom wall
writing is rarely viewed ascontaining
any serious messages. Graffiti tells us
how different we are from what we like
to think. When a wall exhibits signs of -
racism, people prefer to ignore them or
pass them off as nonsense because
they fear what they read. Graffitiin the
bathrooms offers the students, faCulty
and administration a picture of aracial,
conflict that is hidden from them. They
must be willing to accept this image
and deal with it accordingly.

I no longer laugh as loudly when
someone jokes about what they had
read in a toilet stall. My research has
enlightened me to many things that I
failed to realize before. .It anythingxl
have come to understand what Paul
Simon meantwhen be forewarned that

a subway wall..."
