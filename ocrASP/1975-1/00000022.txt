4939. I realize that by identifying myself by my
social serenity number I am supporting the
contention that we are deperaonalized by
machines at SUNYA. but then again. it is the
computer who rally knowa who I am.

I am 099404939, no doubt about it. Every
once in a while; I go down to the computer
center and puncha few keys, just to make sure.
It never fails. For two years here at SUNYA I
haven't altered one bit. I am always 099-40-
4939. It is very reauring.

0h. ldon't go around introducing myself by
my student ID. number. Quite the contrary.
Many people here know me by my given
name. Jason. Jason 1'. Albright, schmuck Pre-
Med student. However. there are quite a few
of you out there who will recognize me as
Steve Morgan. and an equally disturbing
number of you call me Keith Borglum.
Impossible you say? Not in this University and

when. without any"re"ason, a short burly lad
with blonde hair and brown mustache

like to work for President Nixon's Re-
Election. I repliedﬂhanks a lot" and turned to
leave to prevertt my saying something more

invitation to a free beer party after the

my own. Steve Morgan.

I really didn't expect anything to come of it.
On the following Saturday. I reported early at
Ike-Election HQ. lest I be seen by any of my
friends. To my dismay. a raging party was in
progress. a Republican party. Biting the
bullet. I dashed in hoping to reap some reward
for my commitment. Before I could curl my
ﬁngers around a glass. the funny lookingdude
from the campus center grabbed my drinking
arm. pulled me into a corner and started to
talk with me. He explained that he knew me
through our large, lecture center Political
Science class. but he didn’t know my name. I

_ again used my hastily contrived alias and my

friend started to introduce me to his friends.
calling me Steve Morgan.

It was amazing. In the brief span of that
Saturday afternoon. I was transformed from
Jason T. Albright. McGovern idealist, to
, teve ..Morgan. Nixon - reactionary. In

But that day. I wasn‘t me. lwas Steve Morgan

and besides. the size of classes and the
numbers of people on campuswere in my

favor. None of those people would ever ﬁnd '
V out that Steve Morgan didn't exist. and never

had. I secured close friendships with many of
the people I met that day and the relationships

' have restrained strong since.

Thai Who Is Keith Iorgluraf

My next venture began almost as innocently
as the tint. A fellow 'sufferer in my lecture
center Psych class asked my my name. I
hesitated a moment. remembering my
experience with the Nixon people and
immediately recognized that this presented a
whole new opportunity. This fellow had long
hair and a beard and I suspected that he
smoked MARIJUANA"! The name I gave
was Keith Borglum.

Later in the week. I spent an afternoon
helping my new friend with aterm paper at his
room. He asked me if I got high. and
practically leaping at the opportunity. I lied.

whipped out a joint and lit up. That was the
very first time I got stoned. With this and
several gatherings afterwards. I was

Steve Morgan also grew and made new
friends and found new ideals operating in a
politically oriented atmosphere and political
community. And. Jason Albright continued
on his original course. lstill muddle around as
a disenchanted pre-med student. Reality
escapes me most of the time. but then who
needs it. Most of my J.T. Albright friends
think I‘m abitwhacked out. If they only knew.

“All the World‘s A Stage...”

Am I a schizophrenic? Au Contraire. I
know exactly what I've been doing and I enjoy
it immensely. If I was schizo. I wouldn't be so
selective with the times l_choorre to flash my
alter egos. It goes without argument that my
multLpersonality could present some real
problems. so most of my friends recognize me
as good old JaSon T.

So all you people out there who complain of
having no identity. what is your problem? In
this huge mass of humanity I‘ve managed to
ﬁnd enough identity to last three lifetimes.
How can you do it? You can ﬁnd a way. the
possibilities are endless. My secret lies in the
fact that I try to spread myself out over several
quads. On Alumni. my home base. lam Jason
T. On Indian where all my activist friends are.
I‘m Steve Morgan. and on Dutch 1 am very
much active as Keith Borglum. I still have twu
quads and the commuters to use yet.

A Walter Mitty reality is'with'in your grasp.
If you feel lost. just go out there and be
someone. it doesn‘t matter who. If you don‘t
like it. you can always be somebody else. I
know. I've been there.

Lament
by N.S.

Sing 0 Muse of a man of laughter

. Who lies now fallen broken in spirit.
Eros. the wielder of gold and lead arrows
Pierced open his heart. then left him to waste.

Hope. daughter of Delusion. why do I seek thee'l
You burn out my stomach and torment my heart.
Let dreams be buried that are phantoms of no substance.
Why can't I willingly accept hateful Fate?

Foolish is the man who doesn't recognize his fate.
The gods shun most him with a stubborn will.
He builds up castles from the sands of futile dreams
‘l‘hen sees them crushed in ﬂoods of painful sorrow.
'l‘imc builds a safe in each man's spirit
It protects deepest feelings. hidden secrets from himself.
But life‘s circumstances may pick that fearful lock.
And you 0 starry eycs cracked open my guarded door.

That door is a dam holding back a restless river.

Dreadful torrents of emotion wait to ravage troubled spirits.
'l‘hc floods will follow the contours of your mind

And thoroughly wash out all other roads of thought.

0 great Sentiment it's you I must master
But my mind is veiled with visions of her.
Her eyes still sprinkle; I‘m helpless. cruel Fortune.
With her I was happy and the first time content

He's ll soul now doomed to a life of wttndcr
chcrlto know the joys of a tranquil spirit.
He will quest to conquer the secrets of nature
And seek a happiness that will never be near.
