One way of dealing with __the

squalor of this slum is drinking.

Most everyone drinks sake’, a clteap

band that he must stop drinking. He '
goes to his friend‘s house, and the
friend decides to talk to the man‘s
wife. Each man gets chummy with
his friend's wife. and. in the blink-of
an eye. the friends switch wives. The
local gossips enjoy seeing this switch,
but no one is terribly surprised or
offended.’The morals of these people
are different than cars. i suppose.

, The third. and perhaps the most
important way of dealing with the
miserable conditions of the slum is il-

film, Dodes'ka-dm. means “the

first plot we set: has to do with a

as the Buxtehutle Trio. Basically an

thrhouse. An interesting point was
that they never appear in the house
itself up‘to this point in time.

That night they both become ill.
They still discuss the house. The
house is now built, an ultra-modem
design. in a metallic rose-pink. with a
porch for the son to play on. The
father recovers from the illness. but
the little boy gets worse. Afraid to
take him to the doctor. the man
deludes himself int6 believing that
everything will be alright. He goes
off and returns with some broth. As
he heats it up. he talks of building a
swimming pool. He opens the door
of the abandoned automobile in
which they live. and the boy's inert
body falls out. The father and the old
wise man cremate the body and bury
it. The father then says “You see.
Kiri. you have your swimming pool
now.“ and suddenly he is standing
before a huge round pool. He is now
in his dream. and thedream becomes
his reality. Illusion is the only way he
can cope with his misery.

Dodes’ka-den is Kurosawa's ﬁrst
ﬁlm in color. and he uses color quite
effectively. In the “trolley“—man's
room. the walls are literally covered
with trolley cars in rainbow colors.
in the style of kindergarten pain-
tings: The ' paintings serve to
emphasize the dully-colorcd house
and the won more daily-colored
lives of the slum dwellers.

Akira Kurosawa must have lived
in the Tokyo slums at one tirne or
another to have been able to portray
this poverty with such a sympathetic
feeling. He is an artist. expressing his
feelings. using celluloid as a canvas.
to show how the deprived of Tokyo
manage to eke out any sort of ex-
istence for themselves.

Ads On. Records?

(ZNS) If you think there are
already too many commercials
around these days. get ready for ads
on the albums you by.

EXIT magazine in Cleveland
reports that reocrd makers are
studying the idea of printing com-
mercials on record jackets. The idea
is that ads could be printed on those
white jackets which serve its
wrappers for an album. and could he

the record ﬁeld. estimates that 20
million L'. I’.'s could net an extra $l.(i
million (dollars) with the extra ads

ltalian operatic style with such songs -

as “What'sthe Matter. Harry?” Ex-
cellent miming of actions such as be-
ing swallowed by a lion contributed
to the humor (the actors use no
props whatsoever).

After the fairy tale "Cinderella"

» was cleverly performed in the style of

six suggested playwrights successive-
ly (Shakespeare. O'Neill, Ibsen. Eu-
ripides etc.). came the f'msle of the
evening. a Rodgers and Hammers-
tein musical comedy about a
plumber. and earthquake and false

a dentist who falls in love with a lady
plumber. but is upset because one of
his patient's false teeth don‘t fit. the
happy ending comes when the
plumber uses her plunger to create
and earthquake'which makes the
patient‘s mouth slam shut around
the false teeth. Sounds wild? It was.
and the songs were amazingly clever.
abounding in puns such as “I‘m
flushed all over“. “You‘ve bridged
the gap—Let‘s take the plunge“ and
“You‘re a pal—I‘ll even do your root
canal.“

The Proposiliun‘s goal is to
entertain—and they certainly
succeed. They work within a semi-
I'ixed framework (their show will
usually include a musical. a foreign
lilm festival. aparody ofplaywrights
etc.). but the framework is free
enough to allow them to improvise
characters. situations. dialogue and
song incorporating audience
suggestions.

’; Improvisatory Group Presents

Audience With A Proposition

by Sharon Swerdloff _
lmprovisatory theatre is exciting
theatre; at company of five young
performers called The Proposition
proved this last Saturday night to a
full house at the Main Theatre. The
Praporin'on‘s format was conceived
of and directed by a man named
Allan Albert and this format.
coupled witlt the talents of the per-
formers. is a sure-ﬁre success. The
show has been running for several
years now in Boston and. up until a
year or two ago. at the Mercer Arts"
Center in New York City. ‘3‘
What makes this show so cxcitlng‘.’

Part of the answer lies in the fact that
it is spontaneous. created on the
spot. and employs the suggestions
given by the audience only a minute
before. II is the sheer delight of
watching your own suggestions
clcwrly and comically incorporated
into improvised mugs and skits that
makes this slum a special experience
for the audience And thcolher part
ol the dinner is that the members of
the company are imcntnc and \cr»

and and earthquake, They even set it
to music!

The members of this company are
Ray Baker. John Montcilh. Olga
llolub. Suzanne Rand and pianist
Allen Cohen. who improviscs the‘
music to accompany thcaction. Itis
difficult to convey the essence of
\that they do. since their material
ones Ils humor largely to the sport»
lancuy of its creation. but I will
attempt to describe how they took
nudicucc suggestions and im-
prmlscil situations around them.

I‘m the first improirsatron. Ray
asked the audience for an em-
barrassing moment and a Hummer
responded with “walking in on your
roommate while he's ‘tlsing' the
room." lhc format was that of a
lorcign film festival. and the scene
was enacted in French. British.
Japanese and Italian. The per—
formers are trained in the sounds
and gestures associated with these
countries. so their foreign gibberish
sounded amazineg real and their in-
tonaitons and expressions were ex-
tremely funny.

sketch employed

Latin Quotations,”

Catsllus to Wilson

 

Former Governor Malcom
Wilson has been fond of liberally
sprinkling his public speeches with
Latin quotations. It was. therefore,
not at all' inappropriate that the
Kn ic‘kcrhocker News. in its
November 6 edition. should employ
Latin phrases in reporting the
Govemor‘s loss at the polls. “Finis”
was one such phrase. and “ave atque
vale“ was another. “Ave atque vale"
means “hail and farewell“ and is the
simple but effective close ofa belov-
ed and famous Latin poem.Catullus
(84-54 B.C.) is the most personal of
Latin poets; in fact he has been called
“the master of self-revelation.“ In
this poem. however, he tells us not of
his stormy love affair with Lesbia.
but rather of his grief at the loss of a
brother. whose tomb he visited in
far-away Asia Minor:

 
 

l have traveled through many
countries and over many seas.

and now I come. brother. to these
sad rites.

I wish to give to you a parting gift;
and to speak in vain to yourﬁilnt

ashes.

Fate has robbed me of you. alas, =
poor brother, taken from me'

pointlessly.
And so—it‘s all that I can do—
accept these gifts.

offered sadly by ancient custom to

your shades.

Accept them—they are wet with a
brother's tears—.

_ and forever. brother. bail and
farewell.

“You swallow up all beautiful
things." Catullus says of death in
another poem, and he himself was
taken at the age of thirty.

 

The Propusi/iun created a great rapport with PAC audlancas.

audience suggestions of a place and a
first line: a ball park. and "Gosh.
these hamburgers stink!" and in-
volved a first meeting between John
and Suzanne. At various points. Ray
froze the action and asked the
audience to help continue the plot.

'For example. he asked. “Why is she
so aggressive?“ and the answer was
"Constipation." Suzanne told John
of her problem and then added. “Bui
I shouldn't be loading all my
troubles on you." This isjust one ex-
ample of the way the performers use
the suggestions to make on-the-spot
jokes and puns. which is why they
are so funny.

Combines Myths and Spies

The next improvisation was an
opera called The Hercules uf Seville
using the suggestions of adilemma.a
myth and a famous woman: what to
have for dinner. Hercules and Mata
Hari. To say that it was wildly funny
would be an understatement. The
complex plot involved a quarrel
between Hercules and Mrs. Her-

and Mata Hari. Hercules pulling off
