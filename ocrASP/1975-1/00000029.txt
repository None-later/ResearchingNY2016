Jack Hardy will play at the Freeze~Drled Coffeehouse thls weekend.

Coffeehouse

by Betty Stein

Jack Hardy, folksinger and
guitarist extraordinaire, will be
appearing at the Freeze-Dried
Coffeehouse in the Assembly Hall
tonight and tomorrow night.

Besides being an exeellent all-
around folksinger, Hardy is also an
extremely versatile topical song
writer. His songs are commentaries
on all aspects of life, ranging from
social position and corruption to
prejudice and injustice. not to men-
.tion the trials and tribulations of be-
ing a folksinger.

Not all of his material takessuch a
serious tone, however, as is evidenc-
ed by one of his compositions en-
titled Swing Song. This song was
written, he explains, “just in case l‘m
ever asked to sing on the Lawrence
Welk Show."

faculty‘s and the student's perfor-
mances, as they consistently remain-

as well as an integral part of the

Recapi‘tulatlon: Mozart's music,
universal "as “it is, attracted an
audience from all “walks of life".
Amazingly, his music, withoutex:
planation, can communicate a'wide
variety of emotions, moods and ex-
pressions. It is a tribute to the per-
formers that these “intangibles”,
which music provides in its own
special way, never ceased emanating
from the Recital'HaIl stage.
Cutlenza: Music. as all forms of
.“rcality”, is interpreted by the in-
dividual solely on his perspective of
the experience. . Persons having
different backgrounds in "classical"
music will not approach it on the
same level. The more one “knows‘”
aboui the music (e.g. era, biography,
harmonic motion, form, etc.) the
greater the perspective, and conse-
quently, the more rewarding the ex-

yaudienee had been offered the op-

' portunity to gain it fuller perspective

of Mann's music. By this we mean
that'so‘me explanatory notes includ-
ed in the’ program might have been
an invaluable aid to the laymen in
the audience. Although the music
conveyed those "intangibles"
without the aid of so-ctillcd
“program notes“. it appeared evi-
dent that the more educated listcncr
might have derived greater pleasure
from thefmusic than those with tin-
trained ears or minds.

No lesser authority than the dis-
tinguished British scholar C.M.
Bowra remarked that the ancient
Greeks valued nothing more highly
in their own traditions than freedom.
By “freedom” they would have
meant being free both front domestic
tyrants and from foreign oppressors.
In his Hi.\'l()l'ft',\' Herodotus. not an
Athenian, expressed the ideal of
freedom thus:

"The Athenians increased in
strength continually and proved
what a noble thing freedom is not
only in one respect but in all. Wltilc
they were governed by tyrants they
were no better iii war than any of
their neighbors. but when they were
freed of their tyrants they become by
far the best.“

The Grecks's victories over the
Persians, in spite of ovcm-helming
odds. at Marathon (490 B.(‘.).
Stiltiinis (480 ll.C.). and l’ltiiiicii (47‘)
ll (1) and even more the courageous
stand of Leonidasrind his small band
of lighters at 'l'hcrtnopylac (4:40
BC.) will always be beacons of
freedom. “The whole carlh is the
memorial of famous men.“ says
l’criclcs iii his Funeral Ortition.

Nevertheless it is ﬁtting that in
modern days a monument has been
erected at Themtopylae.

Under Roman rule the Greeks not
only maintained their identity but
passed much of their own culture on
to their conquerors. “Conquered

In l82l, after almost four ccn-

Marvel Rises from Dead

by Todd Allen

Stronger than Buck Rodgers,
faster than Flash Gordon. able to
leap over the carillon tower in a
single bound, Captain Marvel made
his dcbtit on campus last Friday
night. This semester, for the first
time ever on the SUNYA campus a
serial, “The Adventure of Captain
Marvel," will be shown in its original
weekly format.

In search of ways to broaden its
scope and provide tthUNYAcom-
munity with an alternative filmic ex-
perience. the International Film
'Group has turned to the serial. The
bulk of the sound serials were
produccd in the late 30's and 40‘s.
Long before tltc advent oftclcvision,
the serial provided a form of con—
tintiing weekly entertainment. Each
chaptcrof the serial would be shown
on it Saturday or Sunday afternoon,
prior to thc matinee feature. Cliff
hanging endings, excitement and
lots of action assured continued
attendance. Certainly many kids of
the day feared the threat of no serial

this week more than they feared be-
ing sent to bed without dinner.

Sound serials were produced from
the advent ofsotind film. up until the
mid 50's, when they died out, killed
by television. The bulk of the serials.
and most of the best serials. were
produced in a fiftccit year period
from 1935 to I950. Virtually every
movie company was involved in the
production ofscrials. but the Icttdcrs
in the field were Republic and Un~
iversal.

livery field of human endeavor
that could be in the slightest \vuy
adventurous or mysterious was
scriiilircd. The majority ol'lhc serials
were based on about five themes:
Westerns. African. super hero. crime
buster, and spaceincn. During this
time virtually all comic book and
pulp heroes and villains were
serialized. The lost includes Super-
man, Batman and Robin. Captain
America, Captain Man cl. Ilic
Green Hornet. the Phantom. the
Shadow. Mandrake tlic Magician.
Deadwood Dick. the Lone Ranger.

big oit G men and Canadian
Mounted Police. but also included
Spy Busters and “The King of the
Big l'op.“ ’I'heir stars included John
Wayne. Bela Lugosi. Tom Mix.
Blister Crabbe. Gene Autry. and
Iain 'I'ylcr.

The serial was very quickly for-
mttlari/cd . ’I'hcy' \\ crc all based upon
incredibly implausible plots and
over dramatic acting. But this is
what makes them so mtich lun. They
are packed with tidycnttirc. thrills.
excitement. and the best at the stunt
men. Impossible l'ciits such its Cap-
ltiin Marvel doing a hack lle to wipe
out tn o enemies abound. lhc acting
is oltcii incredibly poor and
melodramatic. yet they nc\cr fail to
capture ottr imagination and pull us
into the name. IE\ cry one of its. at
otic time or another has lclt the ttrge
to yell "I iiok out behind yoti !" to the
licio. Iliis also. is clitirtictcrtistic of
the serial.

lhc Criptian Miir\cl serial being
shown by I.I5.(i. is one of the best
serials c\cr made. lhc acting is
bcitci titan most. and ilic special
tillects are super. llic sequences of
Captain Mancl in ﬂight tire better
than most of the Superman se-
quences \yc'yc till seen. Comic book
fans should he warned. though. The
Captain Marth of the serial is not
the same one as the one of the
Mary cl Comics. Though he has the
strciigih of Hercules. wisdom of
Solomon. ctc.. hisorigin is different.
Also. like comic book heroes and the
seritili/cd Superman. this Captain
Marielhasnocompunctionsagainst
killing his enemies. In one scene, for
example. he turns a machine gun on
fleeing enemies. But, despite a few
minor character changes. he is still
Captain Marvel.
