Flavours ‘-(I'he uesu Who') It‘s
been many years sirice‘ The Guess
Who released ihe hits *These Eyes“
and f‘Ameriean Woman.“ Since that
r the they have experienced many

 personnel changes..the latest being
the addition of cit-James Gang
guitarist Don Troianb. From theex-
eetlent workhed‘oes onFlavours. it
'. seems as ifhe will bewell received by
"music afficionados.
Divoreing themselves from typical
 dance music. The Guess Who have.
. diversiﬁed their musical approach in

order to incorporate other styles.‘

The group has still retained the abili-
ty to produce hard driving songs—9

the A M-destined “Dancing Fool“ or ,

"Dirty“~but now they have ex-
panded and have embraced some
new sounds. "Loves Me Like A

Flavours is more than just a good

realize its tnusical potential. The

Bowie‘s. aside from the vocals. And
Bowie’s last two albums have been
crying out for Ronson‘s guitar. But
that‘s another story.“ " '

On his own compositions Ronson
takes on most of the'instruments:

clarinet. harmonica. There‘s no
brilliance here. but he does do sur-
prisingly well.

temporary musician in Europe.“ ' '

Urbaniak‘s European roots are in
evidence 'on pieces such as.
“Mazurka”. where he provides the
traditional Polish folk dance with a
jazz interpretation and instrumenta- . -.
tion. He’s chosen an excellent
rhythm section. and even though»
there have been some changes in the
line-up since the album was cut. sell-
out crowdsat Max's and the Bottom
Line confirm that the originality.
tightness. and magic of the album
have not been lost. '

The most remarkable and unique
aspect of Michal‘smusic is thcamaz-
ing voice of his wife. llrszula Dud-
/iak'. Willi no lyrics on the album.
she utilizes her voice as an instru-
ment. an ulna/ineg versatile instru-
ment. With the aid of a few elec-
tronic devices. she soars and slides
with the music. making .Il'l'rllA -
and l‘usion so much more than
simply another addition into the

lyrically. Suycr's songs are a ettt

Carole King. Laura Nyro. he wrote
for other artists before deciding to
sing his own material) filled with
more titan just rhetorical trash.
Credit for the musical side of the
album must go to David Courtney.

adds a little piano on sevci'al cuts.

Why. then. hasn‘t Leo Sayermade

singers on the music scene today.
l.co Sayer has shown the ability to
perform his songs well. as in the
songs “llells ot'St. Mary“ or “Just A
Boy“. Unfortunately. Leo has not
ftilly reached the level of consistency

essential to success. When he loses
control. Suyer‘s voice enters the
cacophonous realm of the ob-

gentle. flowing vocals. llc deﬁnitely
shows promise. Some day he‘ll have
a fantastic greatest hits album. but
until then. unless he learns to keep a
