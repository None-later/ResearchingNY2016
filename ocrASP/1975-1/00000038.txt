Criticism of the law has not justi'ksuddenly materialized. Dissatisfaction with the
‘ seemingly discriminatory nature of the law has been evident since its introduction two
years ago. Convicted murderers can find themselves out on parole after seven years.
while those. convicted of possession of hard narcotics often face mandatory life
sentences. The symbol of justice. blind and balanced.rings hollow in the light of this-
law. . t ‘ . ‘ .
The Governor's tentative step into revision of the Drug Law is welcome. to say the
least. Perhaps under his guidance and leadership. our representatives in the Capitol
will see to it that another year doesn‘t pass with the Law intact.

Follow The Bouncing Check ,

Judging from the latest action taken by the Faculty Student Association. the
economies of many students are in as bad a condition as that of the nation. Too many
students. it seems. are ﬁscally bankrupt. and are passing off their bad debts on FSA
through rubber checks. Asa retaliatory measure; FSA responded by eliminating all
second party checks from the dwindling list of negotiable items at the Check Cashing
Window. Now. no one will be able to cash a check from home unless it is made out to

FSA Check Cashing Service. not exactly a move likely to be taken by unkowingr

parents and other benefactors. Payroll checks thus become useless at the Windwo, and
everyone is inconvenienced because of the reaction by the FSA Board of Directors.
Worse still. due to the composition of the Board. a student had to vote in favor of the
service reduction for it to be passed.

'It can easily be argued that there are other solutions to’the problem. that we should
crack down on the students passing bad checks with heavier and heavier punitive
measures before we limit the service itself. Only thirteen percent of the bad checks
passed are personal second-pany checks. So why ban them completely? However.
Director Norbert Zahm points out that it isn‘t clear who should be notiﬁed when a
second-party check bounces: the person who makes out the check. or the person who
cashcs it. FSA can do little to that second party. especially if they are ....n- ‘ nts. In
essence. added punitive measures are oniyeffective when clear l’esponsibility for the
crime can be directed at a speciﬁc student. Thus. out with the second-party personal
checks. Now FSA will hit hard at the erring students; indeed. some may ﬁnd
themselves. in jail.

‘Even more than we deplore the inconvenience. we understand the position of a
viable FSA. FSA serves mostly students. and is governed (for the time being) more by
students than by any other group. Theft is generally a disgusting thing to do. but
somehow crime by students against fellow students is worse. It appears that our society
is geared towards this. and probably encourages it. but thatdoesn‘t mean we have to
tolerate it.

The Economic Titanic

Gerald Ford has sold out. Or rather. he has
abandoned a sinking ship. That ship is the
conservative ideology of a balanced budget.
By his action in publishinga federal spending
program which will have a gap of at least 52
billion dollars between what the government
receives in taxes and what it spends. the
President has admitted that the problems of
modern government have outgrown the rules
and strictures of balance so applicable ill the
past. Some people have really believed this for
sometime. but the point has been driven home
by the fact that the man who approved this
budget for debate in Congress was. while in
that arm of govemmentpa harsh critic of
Administration ﬁscal “irresponsibility”. His
vantage point is how different. and so
therefore. are his views.

President Ford was. while preparing the
budget. faced with some major problems. One
was built-in federal programs that cannot be
terminated. He addressed this difﬁculty by
asking for some rather large cuts in some. and
only small increases in others. He may find
tough going on this score. Oneexample of his
requests is a 5% increase in Social Security
benefits. at a time when inﬂation is ravaging
the aged at. a i2% yearly rate. This situation is
abhorrent to many in congr‘gs'. attd’especially
to the liberal Democrats.

_ Of course. the main reason for the site of the
deficit is the recession. Business is
contributing lets tax money because of
reduced net income. The situation is worsened
by the fact that a greater number of people are
out of worlt. thereby hardening the
government with more unemployment
payments. lt isthe President's assumptionthat
if we had a healthy economy. this part of the
deficit would resolve itself. He'll probably

correct.

But another implication of that statement it
perhaps not so correct. “In short." he said. “1|
the economy were operating at tile rate 01 :1
year ago...we would have balanced hudgt‘h
both this year and next." However. his
appraisal seems to be out of tune with reality.
For if the economy were operating at a solid.
stendyrate. the President and Congress would
not be in it state of mind where they would
encourage belt-tightening and budget cuts.
Programs would most likely be expanded. not
reduced. And we would probably still have it
deficit. eVen given the fact that a tr it cut would
not be granted to Americans.

A third difficulty was what to do about the
military. The problem was solved citsin
enough. The President asked for an increase of
IO billion dolhrain military spending. It seems
that theArmed Forces is the one area that may
never be cut in this time of constant
international danger. despite the domestic
situation,

So the basic format of the budget is one of
general belt-tightening. It is still the largest
budget in our history and the 52 billion dollar
deﬁcit will probably approach the 70 billion
dollar! Ford warns about if Congress does not
accept his cuts. It seems unlikely llltlt a lihcml
Congress will sit still for all the Presidential
requests. For liberal politicans often rctlcl to
hard times by increasing benefits, not holding
the line or reducing them.

And looking at the long-term future of
American budgets. it seems that lhc)’ W‘”
rarely. if ever. be balanced. There are loo
many inexorable forces working against llllli.
It seems that a major accomplishment lor
future Administrations and Congresses would
be to hold down the size of the deﬁcit».
