' he goodnews for the college

I“ grad seeking employment is

that this year’s job outlook will
only be a little worse than last year's.
"The bad news is that last year's
opportunitieswere the worst since
World War 11.

lust how bad the job market is
depends on two factors: your chosen
field and your expectations.

Most surveys agree that chemical,
mechanical and electrical engineers
(in that order) will have the least
trouble finding iobs in their field, and
that professionals in accounting, sales,
and computer systems remain in
demand by job recruiters.

All other areas, according to a
survey of 701 employment
organizations taken by the College
Placement Council (CFC), show
declines- in anticipated hiring:
Sciences, mathematics and other
technical openings are down 12%;
business is down 11%, other non—
technical openings are down three per
cent and unclassified jobs are down six
per cent. '

Hiring by state and federal
governments is, however, expected to
be about the same as lastyear. In its fall
newsletter the Civil Service
Commission said that last year more
than 12,000 liberal arts and other
"generalist" candidates were hired out
of a total 22,600 new jobs and that
hiring should increase'to 23,000 in
1975 although budget cutbacks could
reduce that number.

Women and minorities will continue
to have an employment edge in white
collar jobs, according to a 1974—45

national recruiting trend survey by
Michigan State University's placement
services. The MSU survey found that
the 220 businesses, industries,
governmental agencies and
educational institutions which
reponded will emphasize hiring of
women and minorities.

Elementary and secondary level
school teachers should again be
feeling the job pinch. last September
221,000 beginning teachers were
competing for only 118,000 jobs,
according to the New York Times.

Nevertheless. in the depths of
globmy predications, an occasional

encouraging report is heard. After

conducting a nationwide study of
white—collar job opportunities, Frank
S. Endicott concluded that "It's much
too soon for college seniors to assume
that there are not going to be any jobs
for them when they graduate."

His survey found that women with
bachelors degrees will find seven per
cent more openings this year than last,
and men with bachelors degrees will
find roughly one per cent more.

The placement director at the
University of Wisconsin agreed with
the Endicott report. "There are a lot
more jobsthan students think," he said.
"A good percentageol new graduates,
expecially liberal arts graduates, get
depressed by what they read and hear,
so they just back off...and don't even
sample the job market. Or they take
the first job that comes along and don't
push for what they should be looking
for."

Despite the fact that those with

graduate degrees are among the worst
affected group (17% fewer openings),

the job shortage may be driving
students into grad schools. Liberal arts
graduates have found the need for
more training or retraining to prepare
for areas in which there may be better
employment opportunities in the
future.

in light of the fact that a college
degree can't insure a graduate a white
collar job of his choice, educators have
taken another look at the purpose of
education.

Many counselors have advised
liberal arts majors to take a computer
science or accounting course A
University of Michigan survey
reported that 35 outol 42 business and
industrial companies said they would
be more willing to hire liberal arts
graduates who had at least some
business» related skills.

At the Association of American
Colleges annual meeting in
Washington, DC. educators debated
whether colleges should adjust their
curricula in order to insure

employable skills or whether the
traditional liberal arts program should
hold fast. '

"If we convinced him (the student) to
come to college to get a liberal
education and to learn, to think and
play with his head, we can graduate
film feeling satisfied," said Arthur
Stickgold, assistant professor of
sociology atCalifornia State University
at Los Angeles.

"ft is simply false advertising to
imply that a BA is a meal tickets-an
automatic entry into middle
management with unlimited career
opportunities,"

'l'errel Bell, US Commissioner of
Education, however, felt that the goal of
the liberal arts college must change.

"Today we in education must
recognize that it is our duty to provide
our students with salable skills. To
send young men and women into
today's world armed only with
Aristotle, Freud'and Hemrningway is
like sending a lamb into the lion's den."

‘r if I"

Phreaks '

by Neil Klotz (CPS) '
‘ ike a lot of blind students, Joe

I ' I 'Engressia found that the

' testpaper—textbook world of
higher education was designed for the
sighted. But Joe could do one thing
better than anyone else on his campus:
whistle at telephones.

foe could identify and whistle a pitch
of any frequency, a talent that enabled
him to reproduce the signals that
operators send over long distance
trunk lines. He could—~and did~call
anywhere in the world free.

Joe was one of the first of the modern
"phone phreaks"or, as the Bell system
has called them, "perpetrators of toll
fraud."

Years later a host of campus phone
phreaks with take credit card numbers
and electronic gadgets to replace loe's
natural gifts have provoked a lull -»~
scale counter—insurgency program
by phone company officials.

Across the country, Bell system
affiliates have launched ad
campaigns, speaking tours and media
blitzes with the common message it

you cheat Bell, you'll be caught.

"Ninety percent of our fraud begins
on campus," claimed a security
supervisor for the Chesapeake and
Potomac (C&P) Telephone Co. in West
Virginia who has been visiting schools
around the state to warn of toll fraud
penalties, At West Virginia University
in Morgantcwn alone, he said, 75
disputed calls are under investigation.

Meanwhile across the country a
Mountain Bell representative was
announcrng that 15 New Mexico State
University students had been
implicated in fraudulently charging
more than $6000 in long distance
calls. Mountain Bell dunned the
offenders to pay up instead of
prosecuting because "people might
say we're picking on college students."

But at Washington University in St.
Louis, students decided to investigate
Southwestern Bell's investigator. They
found that the phone agent was
monitoring long distance calls from
private phones in an effort to catch
phony credit card users.

When confronted, the agent refused
to say if he was randomly monitoring
all calls or using other kinds of taps
because it would give Violators "more
fuel."

it the (students) have done nothing
wrong they have nothing to fear," said
the agent. 'But if they are doing
something wrong, they had better be
scared. You never know how much we
know."

The crash antiulraud program has
had some effect. According to the
AT&'f' national office, the dollar loss
from phony creditca rd calls—the most
common type of fraudrehas dropped
from $225.15 million in 1973. The
company had no idea how much was
fining lost through electronic devices
which Simulate operator's signals.

Most of Bell's anti phreak publicity
has ernpliasrzed (1) the harsh penalties
for toll fraud and (2) mysterious,
sophisticated eletronic gadgets and
corriputers that make it Virtual suicide
to cheat the phone company.

l\t) one has disputed the first
Ittiriltnilloti. The federal "fraud by
wrre" thl (l'd US 1343) stipulates
Violrtltil‘S may be lined as much as
‘f; ftJOt) and ldllCCl up to five years.

in addition, individual state laws
deal wrth toll fraud in varying degrees
of severity. For instance, in Wyoming a
phoiiv: phreak can be fined as much as
‘iiltttl and jailed for 60 days, but in
Pennsylvania the same offense could
land him in prison for seven years With
a fine of $15,000. '

Fifteen states have also made it
illegal to publish information on how to
rip off the phone company, a law not
yet tested against the First Amendment
in federal court.

The Bell system itself may legally use
almost any method to catch
detrauders. Federal law does,

however, restrict random monitoring
of calls to "mechanical or service
quality checks."

Despite this, AT&T affiliates do
secretly monitor about 3.5 million
private phone calls a year, according
to the Wall Street Journal. On the
pretext of checking operator
efficiency, said the Journal, the world's
richest corporation can actually listen
in on any calls it wants to.

Not so, an AT&T security spokesman
told CPS. Phone company agents only
monitor calls when there is already
reason to believe fraud is being
committed, he said, but he declined to
say how else it gathered information
about defrauders. "That would be
giving you the key to the sale," he said.

Some of the "keys" were discovered
by toe "the Whistler" Engressia, who
was hired by an independent phone
company in Tennessee after his
college days. He found the
atmosphere "oppressive," however,
and now works as phone supervisor for
a correspondence school.

loe provided CPS with the following
rundown of the latest toll fraud
detection and prevention schemes:

Against phony credit cards:
Prevrous phone credit card codes
have been very simple. Almost before
the code was released each year one
operator or another leaked it to the
underground press. 50 Bell's only
delen se was to requireoperators to ask
credit card users a few simple
questions about their "firm" and hope
that would scare them off.

Either this year or next Bell plans to
introduce a complex code that only a
computer could decipher. The
operators would have to clear each
credit card call with the main
computer before letting ilgo through.

Against "blue boxes": Blue box
users must dial a toll free number with
an 800 area code or long distance
information (area code) 555—1212,
before boxing a 2600 Hz. tone. This
allows them to then bleep out any long
distance number they want.

Computers in many telephone
billing offices now call attention to
excessively long 800 or long distance
into calls. Next Bell puts a filter on a
suspected blue boxer’s line that

..

records every time a 2600 Hz. tone
occurs on the line.

Against "red boxes": Red boxes ‘

duplicate the electronic sounds coins
dropped in a pay phone produce. Bell
has begun training operators to listen
for take tones. in addition, when an
operator tries to manually collect or
return coins, a light will show if they're
present. Red box users are usually
caught when they have a "favorite"
phone booth.

Against "black boxes": Black
boxes, also known as "mules," lower
the electrical resistance on a phone
line to a point where phone company
billing equipment isn't triggered when
one receives a long distance call.

Most Bell central offices with an

Electroinc Switching System (ESS) can, .

detect voice currents on a line that is
not billing and cutoff an incoming call
to one's line if the computers don't
show he answered. If that happens
often, they check the phone.

Against loose lips: Big mouths
have been the death of most phone
phreaks. And when one is busted,
phone agents wrlf often capture his
notebook containing the numbers of
other ph reaks. 'I avoided detection for
so long because I kept everything in
my head," loe recalled.

Joe said he hasn't done any
ph'reaking for four years, partially
because he ,never really wanted to
injure the phone company.

"i was only doing it to learn enough
to get a Bell system job when I
graduated," he said. "But by the timel
did Bell considered me a security risk."
