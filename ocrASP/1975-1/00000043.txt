Senate. It is. the-Written document which
theoretically guides the conduct of the body as
a whole and of its individual members. _

The day, before, on January 13, the
Assembly, under Democratic control for the
first time in ten years. passed its own version of .
rules—reforms highly touted by consumer
interest groups. Political pundits cast their eye
toward the Republican Senate in anticipation
over the reforms that would result from the
Tuesday. January l4 meeting.

A few facts are crucial before one can fully
understand what was supposed to happen in
that chamber. Under the state constitution,
the Senate is chaired by I the-"Lieutenant

Governor. The internal organization of the,

Senate is run by the Temporary President of
the Senate, almost invariably the Majority

Leader. Krupsak is the Senate‘s President. ,.

Warren Anderson (R-Binghamton) is the
Temporary [President' and the Majority
Leader. Krupsak isa Déhtocrat; the Senate is
Republican. Krupsak isa woman; the men call
the-shots in the Senate. g» ,

A boat ride on theMediterroneon?

 

by Paul Pelagalll

l heard a rumor that the Star
Spangled Banner is going to be
replaced by Merle Haggard‘s “Okie
from Muskogee." This will never
happen because the majority of Con-
gress doesn't care for country music
and it takesa 2/3vote of both houses
to change our national anthem.

Even, though the chief legislative
body doesn't like country-western
music. a lot of other people do.
Thursday night at the Palace
Theater a crowd whose dedication to
country-western music was strong
enough for them to stretch their tight

budgets. got a healthy serving of
what they paid for with Linda
Ronstadt and Badge.

Badge is a local band “new to the
country scene." They have been
playing in country-westem bars
between here and Schenectady but
they hope to broaden the area they
cover. Their performance at the
Palace should assure them of many
bookings.

The members of the band are
Mike O'Leary (vocals. tenor guitar
and harmonica). Jimmy Barber
(vocals. bass). Kenny Gertz (vocals,
ovation acoustic guitar), John Cor-

 

  Vocalist Shines

rigan (dmms) and Rick Morse
(pedal-steel guitar). All have known
each other for years except for Ken-
ny who was introduced to Mike at
the Eighth Step Coffeehouse where
Mike was performing.

Their opening song was “Jam-
balaya." a bayou song which almost
stirred to life the lethargic crowd. l
was pleased to hear a few Hank
Williams‘ tunes, particularly “Your
Cheatin' Heart." Commander
Cody's “Down to Seeds and Stems
Again.“ Haggard's “Fightin‘ Side of
Me" and “Wabash Cannonball,“
written by AP. Carter. are some of
the standard country songs which
are part of Badge's repertoire. Mike
sang a really nice tune callcd
“Florida” which is part of an opera
he wrote.

Although they have linc voices
and harmonics, Badge has to rely on
them too much. lnstrumcntally
they‘re a little thin but Rick has
recently become acquainted with the

'difﬁcult pcdul-slccl guitar and his

development on it should give them
a fuller sound.

For quite a while now I‘ve loved
Linda Ronstadt's voice and l'vc

wanted to see her in concert. i had

high expectations but the moment
she opened her mouth i knew I
wasn't to be disappointed. Linda
doesn't move much and she only
plays acoustic guitar on a few songs

cot-mun - but her voice is enough to attract all

of your attention.

 

Ronstadt and band produced excellent harmonica.

After thc glaze over your eyes
clears up you notice her cute face.
particularly hcr largc eyes. Her shy,
subducd'on-stuge presence is perfect
for conveying the passionate songs
which she sings best. Many of her
songs were from the album “Don't
Cry Now." probably hcr bestalbum.
“Love Has No Pride," "Desparado"
and "Colorado" are all soft. tender
C&W numbers. Linda‘s voice was
impeccable and her treatment of the
songs was perfect. Along with these
she did numbers ranging from a
trucker's song called “Willin‘ " to
Martha and the Vandellas‘ “Heat
Wave."

Shining behind Linda was her
back-up band.Three of them switch-

ed off on piano. guitar’and pedal-
stcel. The bassist also played the
banjo and harmonica. Only the
drummer played a single instrument.
The high point of the night was
“Silver Threads and Golden
Needles." a fast country tune.
Featured on this song was double
pedal-steel guitar.

The only thing I can complain
about is that Linda was on for only
an hour. However. I was told by a
member of Badge that she was suf-
fering from stomach pains which
may account for the short set.
Despite the concert's lack ofquanti-
ty, the quality was good enough. sol
didn‘t care that my request for com-
plimentary tickets had been denied.
