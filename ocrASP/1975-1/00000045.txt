Engineers Leash

by Mike Pick-raid

Up against what probably was
their stiffest competition of the year,
the Albany State junior varsity
basketball team went down to their
second defeat of the campaign.
Saturday night.'at the hands of the
R.P.l. Engineers. 65-56 in front of a
disappointed home crowd.

The loss came right on the heels of
the Pups‘ 93-27 victory over Utica
earlier in theweelt.and left their log
at 8 wins-2 losses.

Varsity Coach “Doc” Sauers, who
has been keeping an eye on the Pups,
remarked that they have been play-
ing against relatively weaker teams
so far..but “now that they‘re up
against the strong teams, they'rcget-
ting a true test."

Probably the biggest single reason
for the loss was the Pups‘ shooting.
or rather. lack of it. A 9 for 35 first
half was matched by a l2/46 second
half of shooting for a horrendous
26% norm. The Engineers.
meanwhile. had no such problems as
they connected on 26 of 57 for a
respectable 46%.

The Pups did have their chances.
especially in the second half when
they came close a few times. But
every surge was thwarted by an
Engineer retaliation in the form of a
quick basket or two. The Pops led
only very early in the contest—the
last time at 9-7—-and after that. were
forced to play cstht-up basketball
the rentsinder of the evening.

Coach, Lewis started Greg John-

- son at guard in place of Steve Pass,
probably owing to Johnson‘s fine
play over the last few games. Ray
Gay. as usual, started at the other
guard slot with Verdejo, Walton.
and Brown up front.

Gay opened the scoring with a 20-
foot jumper from the key which was
answered by a Chris Esch driving
layup for a 2-2 tie. Two free throws
by Gay at 2:50 put the Pups up
before falling behind 5—4 a minute
later. The reason for the low score at
this point was due to the excellent
defensive play’of both squads as they
forced the opposition to work for
every shot in a patterned offense.
Neither team was able to fast break.

l'ups lead early

With l4 minutes left in the first
half. Gay found Verdejo underneath

" for a twisting layup totie the score at

7-7. Steve Pass. now in for Johnson,
then made a beautiful steal at mid-
court and converted the driving
layup for a 9-7 Albany lead; the last
time the Pups would be in the
driver‘s seat the rest of the game.

Ten consecutive points engineered
by the Engineers put R.P.l. on top to
stay as they opened up a l7-9advun-
tage. Mike Chapman. with two
offensive rebounds and buckets and
Bill .Chapman with a long-range
swish. did most of the damage as
R.P.l. seemed to be continually get-
ting position underneath.

Meanwhile. the Pups were having
their problems in the personal foul
department. Verdejo picked up;his

shoots ' lit-iii for only eight points.

The electrifying performance by
Johnson is saved for the climax of
the play. v I

‘ Rich Kapner was injured onstage
durin the first act. His part was
played by the understudy as he was
unable to continue.

Act Two began with little change
for the Danes. The opposing team
(named lthaca. presumably signiﬁ-
cant of Grecian tradition) builds a
64—44 lead with “:55 remaining on
the omnipotent score clock high
above the stage. '

The action is heightened at this
point as the home squad rallies for a
25-14 exchange in the span of eight
minutes. The Ithaca lead is nine
points with 3:25 left in the second
act. During the Dane spurt. there are
memorable performances by Kevin
Keane and Mike Suprunowicz. They
hit six and seven points respectively.

Sauers has effectively set the at-
mosphere for the remaining
moments. The audience however,
becomes restless (as does this un-
suspecting witness). The spectators

' came tonight to watch a comedy, not

a tragedy, the aura of doom lies over
the arena as the Greek opponents
check the Dane comeback. With
forty-two seconds remaining. the
score is 86-77, the Hellenic forces
safely ahead. It is now that Sauers
unleashes his trump card—Ed John-
son.

Ed Johnson is the star in Sauers'
cast for the premier performance of
this play. This is only Ed's second
year as part of Sauers‘ company but
he steals the show each time he is
called upon.

Sauers carefully unleashed his

Pups

third foul with about eight minutes
left in the half and saw limited play-
ing time as did Gay who was also
slapped with three before halftime.
An Eric Walton offensive rebound
and basket closed the gap to four at
l9-l5 and two Brown free throws cut
it to 24-2l a little later, before R.P.l.
scored seven of the last ten to lead
3l-24 at the half.

The second half opened with a
Johnson to Walton backdoor layup
to make it a ﬁve-point game. But a
succeeding 8-2 burst and the
Engineers led by l l with Lewis forc-
ed to call a time out to regroup his
team. He must have told them
something because the l’ups then hit
eight in a row! Verdejo hit two free
throws. Pass hit a 20-footer. Walton
connected on a tap-in. and Johnson
snared a layup and now the score
was 39-36 with |4'.2l remaining.

But that was the last gasp for
Lewis‘ hoopsters as R.P.l.. with
Doug Rykhus leading the way. went
on a 9-l spree and virtually iced the
game. With Verdejo fouling out at
10:20. and the l’ups' shooting ice
cold, the differential was too much
to overcome. Johnson gave the
crowd a little excitement down the
stretch as he popped acouple in from
outside but it was not enough this
time.

Rykhus finished as high scorer
with l6. while only Johnson with I2
(eight in the second half) and Walton
with it (seven in the second)hitdou-
ble ﬁgures for the Pups.

ﬁnale. Gary Trevitt hits a shot to Ibr-
ing the Danes to within seven with
thirty-four seconds left. A quick
travelling violation gives the ball
back to thevDanes.

Ed Johnson takes the ball and
drives past Achilles and Hector to
lay the ball safely into the basket. A
foul is added on and the Danes trail
86-82 with nineteen precious seconds
remaining. - ‘

Johnson. the protagonist, com-
mits a back courtfoul and the free
throws raise the Ithaca lead to six.
However. the ball is returned to
Johnson who hits a short jumper
with nine seconds left. New Sauers
can taunt his audience as he sees ﬁt.

lthaca is unable to ﬁnd an opening
on the inbounds pass so they call

time out with a scant five seconds left

on the clock .

Doc Sauers now gives the
audience a startling soliloquy in
which Ed Johnson asks everyone to
believe. lthaca's pass is thrown and a
whistle is blown. “Offensive foul
thirty-ﬁvebluc"is the call. This line
will becomca classic for theatergoers
everywhere.

The clock reads four seconds. the
players claiming it should be ﬁve
because of non-possession. in the
fracas, we see Mike Suprunowicz at
the foul line. Mike hits twa perfect
charity attempts to bring the score to
88-86. again only four seconds on the
clock.

Ithaca again has trouble with the
pass and is called for travelling with
three seconds remaining. The climax
of Sauers‘ instant classic script is
about to materialize.

The Danes line four warriors in
front of Kevin Keane who is assigned

the task of mobilizing the ﬁnal shot.
Keane ﬁnds an opening for the pass
and guides the ball to Ed Johnson.
The superstar stops at the foul-line.
jumps, and releases the ball with a
perfect arc toward the basket. The
ball slowly begins its descent as the
clock shows one second. The ball
goes through the basket, Johnson
leaps into the air, and the buzzer
sounds.

.The second act comes to a close
with the teams tied at 88-88. The
audience, that began to doubt this
outcome just minutes before. are ex-
uberant. They anxiously call for the
conclusion of the drama.

The epilogue begins as both teams
trade baskets. Then the star of the
performance leads a Dane surge of
twelve points. Who else but Ed
Johnson would have this part in the
play? Sauers has a superb talent in
Johnson and the script emphasizes
the young guard. '

The ﬁnal score in this story is ill-
94. Mike Suprunowicz tallied 26
followed by Johnson and Morphis
with 2|. and Trevitt with is.

Sauers‘ brought delight to the
audience that ventured to watch his

newest literary effort. Due to the

spontaneous nature of the story. it is
doubtful that Sauers will offer a
return showing. instead, he brings
another untried script to the gym on
Tuesday. The author tells us that it
involves his acting company in
search of conquest against a foe
named Geneseo. The performance
begins at 8:30. i recommend that you
get there early for a good seat. Doc
Sauers has proven himself a master
of entertainment. With Ed Johnson
in his cast he can never go wrong.

ports Funding  SA Questioned 

by Betty Stein

linrly last December. SASU
decided that Student Associrrtiortsol‘
the SUNY system should not con-
Iirtrrc to assume as rtutch of the
responsibility for funding inter-
collegiate athletics as tltcy bane nr
the past. According to lrn llirn-
brurnt. Student Association Vice-
President. it resolution was passed
urging all SUNY schools to
withdraw front the NCAA until an
exception is made to the rule which
requires that uthlctic advisory
boards be under institutional con-
trol.

"SU NY‘s position is unique“. said
Birnbnum. "in that tltcircompctitivc
athletics progrrrmstrrc furtdcd entire-
ly by student tax money." Birnbuum
continued, saying “our policy has
always been that control over money
raised by students should remain
with students."

Such it resolution. it prrt into
effect. would ntrrkc it neccsstrry for
tire llni\crsity to consider assuming
2r larger part of the financial brrrdcn
for intercollegiate athletics ii the
p rogrum were to be mrrintrrincd at its
present iL‘\t.'i.

Two-“try Proposition

i’lt)5lt’tli liduczrtion Director. Joe
(irrrcin, when asked how hc left
about Unitcrsity funding of athletics
as opposed to student funding.
replied; "l cult foresee no way for the
strrle to subsidi/e tltc program irt its
entirety. it just has to bc a two-way
proposition.“ Speaking in reference
to financial contributions that Stu-
dent Association has made to the
athletic program. Garcia said. “they
have been jost tremendous as far as
funding is concerned. and I feel

wc‘vc given them hack it darn good
investment." '

this issue of the extent to which
the student body should be expected
to lttnd competitive athletics was
uriscd in it different form by llrrvid
Coyrrc. At a recent Central Council
Meeting. Coync introduced it bill
that. hard it been passed. would have
lowered the food allowance for
ulhlctcs ort uwrry trips from eight
dollars to five dollars per day. [his
\tou id have put their food allowance
on par with that of other students
who make trips as representatives of
the school (i.e. SASU delegates). At
present. tltcy receive only five dollars
per day.

Coync claims that the bill. which
was defeated 8-!0-0. besides making
the situation more equitable. would
have involved it suvingsof$71l0ll per
year. In his estimation. its defeat is
but another reflection ol the “very
specific different treatment" uc-
corded ‘to athletes by the Central
Council.

Unique Relationship

l'lrc nature of what Coync refers
to us special treatment may be traced
to the unique relationship between
