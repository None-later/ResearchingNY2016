“I walked in and lwas'rll'ysh’ak-
g. I mean it; I was so nervous that

my palms were sweating and I could ,

hardly talk.”

This was how Tom Castellano. a
sophomore at S.U.N.Y. at Albany.
described his anxiety concerning his
ﬁrst interview for the position of
Resident Assistant on State Quad.
Castellano. like many of the ap-
proximately five hundred
sophomores and juniors competing
for the select “ILA.” post. blamed his
fears on the subjective interviews
which characterize the application
procedure.

This process. initialed afteraman-
datory campus-wide interest
meeting held each November for
prospective R.A.‘s. terminated the
following Srpirtg. In early March.
each applicant receives either a fat
letter. signifying acceptance. or athin
note of refusal. During the four in-
tervening months. the applicants.
the present R.A.‘s. and the Quad
Directors. undergo a rigorous series
of individual quad meetings and in-
terviews leading to the R.A. selec-
tion.

Besides receiving written
evaluations from his current R.A. as
well as from his Residence Hall
Director. each applicant must attend
three. hour-long individual inter-
views. The first. an attempted infor-
mal conversation between two
students and the applicant. is an
endeavor to get to know the can-
didate and discern hisideas.feelings.
and conception of the post. Follow-
ing this is an applicant-structured
interview. a meeting between a staff
director. a current R.A.. and the
applicant in which each candidate
chooses his preferred topic and set-
ting. Finally. a director and can-
didate meet for a gcneralevalualion
of the process and foradiscussion of
the student's chance of securing the
job.

By last week. only the initial inter-
views had been completed. but both
the applicants and the staff members
httd already developed and
crystallized their opinions of the
selection process. "lfyou have a bad
day or have a personality conflict
with an interviewer. you might spoil
your chances. lt's so arbitrary.“
Castellano complained. Nancy

However. a Ill-year-old Los

extension).

' sophomore candidate agreed. say-

ing; “No one can expect to know
whether you‘ll nuke a good ILA.
after talking to you for an hour.“

Current R.A.'s agreed with these
charges. “I hate interviewing because
I hate beingput into a position where
l have to evaluate people." admitted
David Taffet. a senior ILA. "I can
give my impressions of a person after
an hour. but I am never sure what
kind of R.A.‘s they would make.”
Bob Lew. ajunior who is a current
assistant. afﬁrmed this feeling of un-
certainty. ‘You are evaluating a per-
son in an hour‘s time who is going to
deal with [20 people within a year. It
is possible to completely snow a per-
son in an interview so how do lknow
what a person is really like. much less
whether they'd make a good KAI?"

Though complaints mirroring
these are profuse. hundreds of
students continue to undergo the
process in the hope they will obtain
the job. The post. designed as a
linkage between students and them!-
ministration. consists ofdealing with
student dormitory problems as well
as working with the professional
residence staff. These duties. often
tedious. clerical matters. entail long
hours manning a desk or ﬁlling out
forms. But both current R.A.‘s and
prospective ones still find the job at-
tractive and desirable.

Remuneration for R.A.‘s consists
ofa free single room in a dormitory
and free localphone service. A token
stipend is also frequently given but
this is never guaranteed. This salary.
far less than what a student would
receive for working similar hours at
a part-time job. is minimal. “The
R.A.'s are grossly underpaid." Judy
Condo. Quad Coordinator for State
Quad. affirmed. “But the job
remains quite popular."

Ms. Condo and Sally Borner. a
Resident Director. listcd several at-
tributes of the post. “Because of in-
flation. manystudents are paying for
school by themselves and they often
prefer having a free room to working
titan off-campusjob." Condo stated.
“And by me tirnca student isujunior
or a senior and is involved with
someone, they want a single where
they can entertain in private,"
Borner suggested.

Candidates agreed that the free.
single room was an important factor
in their applying for the RA. posi-

 

tion but they agreed that there were
other characteristics that were eq ual-
ly important. “lt‘sa big challenge. At
the end of the year. if i feel that I
made it a more pleasant stay and
people came up and told me that. I‘d
be really happy." Castellano ex-
plained. Bob Field (fictitious). a
sophomore applying for all R.A.
position on State Quad. hopes "to
get the satisfaction of moldingo restl-
ly close-knit group.“ Other citn-
didutes voiced similttr desires.

“There is a kind ofaura around an
R.A. You have a big name and know
a lot of people. lt‘sjust being part of
a team." Caslellano stated. Both
applicants and current R.A.‘s.aware
of this quality attached to the posi-
tion. commented on it. "You have an
opportunity to meet a lot of people
and get involved more than most
students can.“ David Taffet pointed
out. The candidates questioned
agreed that the popularity most
R:A.‘s seem to possess largely con-
tributed to their decisions to apply
for the post.

Despite the grueling interview
process. many sludenlsarc willing to
try to attain the R.A.job. Agreeing
that the interview procedure may be
unfair and students are often hired
who make poor R.A.‘s. Condo in-
sisted that. “The subjective interview
seems the most effective way. If this
was an administrative post. we could
give a quiz. or a test to see whether
you know all the rules. But it's not
and only through some informal
cnnta‘ct can we ascertain whether it
student can relate to people."

The disposal of his bill proposing a
decrease in food allowance for
athletes coincided almost exactly
with the ﬁling of a petition for his
removal from Council. This petition.
presented to Fidler by Coun-
cilmembers Gary Bennett and Gary
Cooke. both AAB representatives.
questioned his legal right to sit on
Council now that he is living off-
campus.

Coyne. who moved off campus
over intersession. resigned from
Council several weeks ago. pending
replacement. He feels that, legally
their position is justified. However.
what he does not feel is justiﬁed is the
fact that it took a political activity on
his part to arouse their interest in the
legality of his sitting on Council: ‘I
think they were right in removing
me. but I think thatthcir motivation
Wits wrong".

Coyne does not seem to enjoy a
harmonious relationship with those
members ochntralCouncilwho are
connected with AAB. Councilman
Lew Barr.afonnermemberofAAB,
expressed his feelings about Coyne
in this manner. “I‘ve been on Council
for three years, and Dave has almost
an obsession against athletics."

Barr called Coyne's bill
“unreasonable” and insisted instead
that the meal allottment for athletes
should be raised. The fact that this
would make the amount even more
disproportionate did not seem to be
a valid issue to Barr, who explained
that “it‘s a question of simple
physics. You can‘t run on an empty
tank. and athletes obviously burn up
it lot morelhan you and ldo in it nor-
mal day“.

Not everyone follows that same
line of reasoning. Finance Com-
mittee Chairperson Ken Wax. com-
menting on the same issue. said
“We‘re all students and we all eat the
same.” adding. “they're not special
people". In his view. five dollars per
day is sufficient for anyone. When
the question of increasing the
athletic food allowance was raised.
Wax scoffed. saying that our AAB
budget is already ridiculous com:
pared to other schools.

Someone who does share Barr's
overall view is AAB member Gary
Cooke. who said. referring to the

food allowances now given to other 7

students. “I'd like to see the allott-
ment remain the same.“ He added
that.in many instances. it is possible
for these students to eat in other
school‘s cafeterias. He did not.
however. feel that the eight dollars
now alloted to athletes was suf-
ficient. According to Cooke. “AAB
would rather see alhletes...cat good
meals".

Interestingly enough. Varsity
basketball coach Doc Saucrs and
Athletic Director Joe Garcia take a
somewhat different view. In their
opinion. food allottments for
athletes should be equal to that of
other students. Garcia maintains
that. “if the students are representing
the University. the dollar should be
equal". That is. provided that the
present allottment is raised.

More central than the caloric in-
take of athletes versus that of non-
athlctcs lie much more basic issues
concerning how much money the
Univeristy should expect students to
contribute to competitive athletics.

that the proportional amountofUn-

state. According to Bristow. “the
determination of how much state
funding is given to University
athletics is made in the context ofthe
total funds“. He noted that. ul-
timately. the decision lies in the hand
of the individual school and is made
according to how important inter-
collegiate athletics is to that par-
ticulut school. as opposed to how
much they are willing to cut back in
other areas.

However. school administration
officials are not the only ones faced
with dccisionsconccrning how much
revenue should be allotted to com-
petitive athletics. The student body
must also make such a decision;
