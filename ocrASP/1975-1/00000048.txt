‘ y :The job outlook for this year's
v‘eollege graduates. is “probably the

I worst since World War II.” says the
January 20.. l975'issae of 17:2
Chronicle of Higher Education. This
gloomy prediction was sounded at
the annual meeting of the Associa-
tion of American Colleges. and
echoed later in interviews with
SUNYA's administrators. The
general consensus among some
leading U.S. educators-is that in this
country‘s tight economic situa'tiont.
the minor'orseoond ﬁeld maybe the
key to finding a job after gradua-
tion.

Assistant Placement Directors
Gwen Simmons and Mary Ellen
Stewart of SUNYA's Placement 0f-
lice agreed with Terrel H. Bell. U.S.
Commissioner of Education. when
he said. “I feel that the college that
devotes itself totally and une-
quivocally to the libe'ral arts today is
just kidding itself...we in education
must recognize that it is our duty to
provide our students also with
salable skills.“

Both placement directors felt that.
with the exception of ﬁelds like
engineering. business education. ac-
cottnting. library education. and
nursing. “The job situation is very
blenk...it's as bad as I've seen it in re-
cent years." “Private companies."
added Ms. Simmons. “are looking
for very narrowly-trained people at
this time...seniors in computer
science. accounting...|n education.
the trend is toward more business-
related subjects like industrial arts
offered in high schools...there is a
return to interest in business and in-
dustrial arts (by students) because
they are seeing that going to college
does not guarantee them a job at the
end of the line."

Dr. Leonard Lapinski and Dr.
Rovert Gibson. University College.
SUNYA. pointed'. out that the
forecast forjobs in the medicaland
legal professions is only partially
sunny.

Mr. Gibson. Assistant Dean for
Social and Behavioral Sciences. said
that nouId-be lawyers must be will-
ing to gojob hunting. They may have
to start in a small firm in an un-
desirable location.

Note of Hope

l)r. Lapinski. Assistant Dean.
Mathematics. Science. ilnd Nursing
Programs. sounded a note of hope
for SUNYA students wishing to
enter medicine. Out of SUNYA‘s
l974 graduates. approximately 34
percent of the students who applied
to medical school were accepted.
This figure isabovc the nationulpro-

jection.

A 3.45 is the grade point average
needed for entrance to meding
sehool_aecording to Lapinski. who"
bases his statement on a national
mean. Individual schoolsmsydifl‘er.
Laplnski said that the scholastic
average needed to enter medical
school has increased over the years.
Now. some medical schools are put-
ting such restrictions as. “Don‘t app-
ly unless you have a minimun 3.45
grade point average." on applicants.
Students must have a 3.45 grade
point average before they are even
allowed to take admissions tests.

"Lately." says Lapinski. "some
students apply to both dental school
and medical school as well. Good
students have to be turned away just
because of numbers.“ (quotas) He
added that. “It‘s now a national
trend“ to rccniit more females into
medical schools. Being admitted to a
medical school. he notes. may de-
pend too on how previous SUNYA
graduates have fared at that school.
If many former SUNYA graduates
did poorly. the medical school may
be reluctant to accept future
graduates. _

The teaching profession. like
medicine and law. is becoming tnorc
difficult to enter. Dean for Student
Affairs. Neil C. Brown. who super-
vises that Placement Office. said that
SUNYA is "producing more
teachers than can be employed.
Sophomores should ' know. about
this—mot to quit teaching but to
develop alternative career choices.

Not only arejobs hard to come by
these days—rtests qualifying students
for jobs are too. Governor Hugh
Carey announced on Wednesday.
January 22. that the Professional
Careers Tests (administered to
students who have a Bachelor‘s
Degree) will not be given. According
to Ms. Stewart of SUNYA‘s l’lace-
ment Ofﬁce. 3.l0(l SUNYA seniors
were planning to take those exams.

_ What does the economic crunch
do to the grades of students? Accor-
ding to Dr. Brown. "There has been
an upswing in thcacadcmic averages
during the past three or four
semesters." Students are becoming
more competitive because they are
concerned about getting jobs or go-
ing on to graduate or professional
school when they leave SUNYA.

Uncertain Future
John Tucker. Personal Counselor
from the Counseling Ofﬁce. noticed
‘that students are becoming more
Itense because of an uncertain future.
Counselors are not dealing with
larger numbers of students. but
students are demonstrating greater
anxiety than ever before. Tucker
thinks that students feel pressured to
do well in their undergraduate work
because they realize their futurcjob
security will be tied to how well they
do in graduate or professional
school. and getting into graduate or
professional school depends on their
achievement at the undergraduate
level.

Just what can a student do besides
scream in desperate frustration? It
seems he must be willing to com-
promise. trusting in future content-
ment. instead ofworrying about im-
mediate fulfillment. ‘ .

Increasingly. women are vtcwmg
secretarialpOsitionsas interimjobs~
something they can do to earn
money while becoming educated for
another type of work.

Often. students can dredge up a
skill acquired earlier in their lives»~
even summer jobs provide an oppor-

 

tunity to begin something that may
develop into a career lateron in life.

Career opportunities exist abroad
also. There are many jobs in the
iields of education and social ser-
vices.

Dean Brown encourages students
to undertake “two track education.“
"For a good many liberal arts ma-
jors. the second field makes the
difference." he said. He encourages

second ﬁelds in urban planning or

government. for example. because
they will increase your chances of
cmployability.
Hem Sandwiches

A growing number of people who
lind themselves in the unemploy-
ment line. with theirham sandwiches
wrapped in their BA dcgrees.are tur-
ning back to community colleges to
obtain Associate’s Degrees in an
cmployable field. The community
college provides a more speciﬁc
focus fora student's talents. With a
BA plus two years at Community
College. or a second field studied
concurrently with the major. a
student‘s chances for employment
are measurably increased.

llrown advises against getting a_
BA and Master‘s in the same field.

His advice is to study a field which
stimulates you intellectually While
studying. something else that win
