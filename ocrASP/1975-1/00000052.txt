All this is not. to say that
Stackridge is simply an imitation of

Stackridge is not “simply” anything.

Dark Horse - George
Harrison Reeo rded and released
to coincide with Harrison‘g ygar and
‘9“; Dark Horse is an intriguing

album. The toll of hard labor is evi-

dent on the hoarse vocals
throughout the album. The music is
more personally oriented. removing
Harrison one step further from his
Battle-days. A promising note is
Harrison's development and use of
slide guitar. definitely his forte.
Though most of the songs are
centered around SRl KRSNA. this
does not hinder the level of perfor-
mance of the music. Well hidden on
the second side is a fairly quiet. sub-
dued piece called “Bye Bye. Love".
The song is performed by Eric Clap-
ton and George Harrison ulone.This
can lead to speculationmwhy
shouldn't Eric Clapton and George
Harrison unitc'.’ Many problems the
two have encountered on their past

Mellow Jazz Explores New Areas I

by Pete Lueldo

Jesus. what a weekend! The
arrival of winterweekend provided a
welcome change of pace to the usual
campus social scene. The regular
bars and movies were available of
course for those content with
traditional Albany weekends. For
many. the Colonial Quad Party
(with unlimited drinks for under a
buck) offered a relief from ac-
cum ulating schoolwork and an alter-
native to seeing “American Graffiti“
for theil'ifth or sixth time. Yet forthosc
with somewhat different interests.
the highlight ofthe weekend was the
free jazz concert held last Saturday
at 8 l’.M. in the Campus Center.

The Jimmy Heath quartet. perfor-
mirtg in a club type atmosphere. kept
theaudieneeofapproximatcly 250in
a mellow mood throughout it‘s three
hour pcrfomtance. The quartet con-
sislcd of Jack Gregg. bassist. Hal
Miller on drtrms. "Snake" on piano
and the ll'llllnr. Iim-ny lIu-ult utt sax
and flute.

“Cloak and Dagger“. and original
composition. started off the first set.
Technical problems plagued the
quartet during the opening moments
as feedback developed while the
lighting system Wits uncoordinated.
l'he enthusiastic audience took it all
in stride and was quickly rewarded
for its patience. In the highlight of
the set. another original named
"Gingerbread Boy" electrified the
ever increasing crowd. Afterwards.
both audience and band settled back
to itn evening of slow and easyjazz
accented throughout by the quartet's
own compositions. a few upbeat
numbers and imaginative solos.

The quartet. riding the wave of in-

creasing interest in jazz has per-
formed throughout the Capital Dis-
trict on its present tour. The group
like many rising recently in the jazz
field is younger while it's format is
looser. This style has endeared them
to a new brand of jazz fans. The
young crowd is tiring of many ofthe
mindless and exploitative hits pass-

The Gastronomical Bean Story

by Jack Heinz

Once upon a time. there lived a
man who had a maddening passion
for Baked Beans. He loved them. but
they always had a very embarrassing
and somewhat lively reaction upon
him. By and by. he met agirl and fell
in love. When it became apparent
that they would marry. hethought to
himself. “She is such a sweet and
gentle girl. she would never go for
this kind ofcarrying on." So he made
the supreme sacrifice and gave tip
hearts. (They were married shortly
thereafter.)

Some months later. his car broke
down on the way home from work
and. since they lived in the country.
he called his wifcand told hcrthnt he
would be home late because of his
misfortune. and that he would walk
home. On his way home. he passed a
small cafe and the odor of freshly
baked hearts was overwhelming.
Since he still had several miles to
walk. he figured that he would work
off arty ill effects of the hearts before
he got home, So he stopped at the
cafe. lletorc leaving he had eaten
three large portions of the baked
beans. .r\l| tltc way hotnc. he putt—
