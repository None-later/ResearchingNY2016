Through the Back Door

For months, the companion search committees. established to find a candidate to fill
the three year Arts and Science Deanvacancy'and to seleeta replacement for President
Benezet, have been engaged in their laborious. tedious processes. The President
announced his intentions to resign early last year. effective at the end of this semester,
while the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences has been vacant since the demise of
I. Moyer Hunsberger. When the senior class graduates in June. there will be no one left
inthis school who will have been here when Hunsberger exercised his full pOWer.

One man will always remember the way in which Hunsberger wielded‘his power. The
way the search committees‘ procedures are developing, Vice-President Philip Sirotkin
stands in the best position to win the presidency, if by no other means than through the
back door. .

When the search committee Dean of the Division of Behavioral Social Sciences
began looking fora new dean, Richard Kendallwas appointed as the acting Dean.“He
held that post for the past two years. When the committee handed in its classw no
recommendation." Philip Sirotkin skillfully put Kendall in the post permanently.
Amid strong dissent an equally strong-support. Kendall stealthed his .way to power
through the back door. That he might have been appointed legitimately is undeniable.
but he wasn‘t. .

if the Swrch Committtee for the Dean of Arts and Sciences reaches its ﬁndings and
hands in a positive report on someone. anyone. before its counterpart for the
Presidency, then Philip Sirotkin will become the next Presidentofthis University. By
stealth. through the back door. Very simply. no one will want to take the job as
Presidentzwhen the number three position on campus. and the number two academic
position (next to the Academic Vice-President) is a setjob for three ofthe five years the
Presidentireigns. .

Such a position for a president is untenable. It means he has little power to
effect academic reform because the A and S Dean will have been appotnted by
someone else. The only one who would be willing to put up with a situation such as this
would be the man who appointed the Dean originally. As it stands. that man will be the
present Academic Vice-President Philip Sirotkin. Thus. it is all too possilbe for the
Presidential Search Commiittee to delay. or hand in a "no recommendation" to the
President. and Sirotkin will. through the back door. take over. it is an unacceptable
scenerio.

Pro Status Quo

The recent report issued by the Office of Undergraduate Studies showing how
students have been taking courses without distribution requirements in enlightening.
Academic Affairs Dean Robert B. Morris correctly suggests it might have bearing on
our deﬁnition of liberal education at SUNYA.

The elimination of course requirements at SUNYA began in Fall. I970 and has
continued without much fuss or fanfare. ‘ I

What appears to be happening. according to the report. isan increase in the number
of courses an average student takes in his major and related ﬁelds.

in the class of 1974. music majors concentrated their course choices in their own
department morethan anyother group ofgraduating majors. The average music major
completed fifty-nine percent of his work within thedepartment. Art majors completed
forty-two percent. and Afro-American Studies majors forty-one percent. .

Most students in the Humanities and Social Sciences took very few courses in the
Natural Sciences and Mathematics. and the bulk ofthose who did were Economics and
Psychology majors. Natural Scicticc majors took more in the other direction. but yet
noi that large a percentage. This is no real surprise when you look at the major
requirements of the different departments. Major requtremcnis make sense. All-
collcge requirements don‘t. I

We can argue about the meaning of a liberal education for ten years and still not
rcallv know more than when we began. but the trust that we put in the hands of
individual students is a sign of our conﬁdence in thier independent pursuit of
knowledge. Some students will never care what courses they take. but care or not.'no
all-college requirements means a more worthwhile. realistic and meaningful education
for all SUNYA graduates.

So let's face it; our (irctit Society is cycball to

Though the country is encountering the

we will experience its counterpart next year in

But it could be much. much Worse. ()itr
