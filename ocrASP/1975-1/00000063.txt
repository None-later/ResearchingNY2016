nnuafly the public spends
Amillions of dollars on many
unreliable nutrition and diet
books. The authors of these books
have no sound nutrition background,
make theories based upon personal
prejudices, misinterpreted personal
. experiences and certain incidents,
stress and promote the use and sale of
certain proprietary organic foods such
as wheat germ, brewer's yeast,
bulghur, papaya juice, yogurt, rose
hips, bone meals, etc., calling them
superior, magic, capable of improving
health, remedies of certain diseases
and causing rapid weight loss. These
books lack supporting data, scientific
proof, and are not recommended and
substantiated by medical, biochemical
research and the Depa rtmentof Health
Division of Nutrition. They are
rnaccu rate, misleading, can cause diet
deficiency, malnutrition, make the
laymen put trust and faith in miracles,
believe in fads, fallacies and lead them

to adopt bad food practices.

Recently the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) made a rule
that would prohibit any false
advertisement saying that:

1. Organically grown foods are
superior and prevent or cure certain
diseases.

   Are   

2. Ordinary foods can not provide
adequate nutrients.

3. Insufficient diet is due to the soil in
which food is grown.

4. Prohibits any nutritional claims for
non-nutritive ingredients and their
combination with essential nutrients
(such as inositol, paraminobenzoic
acid, rufin and other flavonoids).

These unrecommended books and
modified diets interfere with the
advancement of nutrition and are a
threat to health. i

All over the world food prejudices,
superstitions, taboos, ignorance and
nutritional and religious customs and
traditions are one of the causes of
malnutrition. Even in theU.S.A.certain
food faddists advocate the use of
"organic food" and deny nutritious
value of scientific techniques in
preparing, processing or cooking
foods. These authors believe in the use
of foods grown on natural organically
fertilized soil and eat raw food as the
primitives. So according to them we
have to deny all scientific, advanced
techniques of agriculture, disregard
the use of fertilizers, antibiotics,
additives, enrichment of flour,
pasteurization, irradiation and
fortification of milk, condemn the use of
iodized salt, fluoridation of water and
forget all about sanitation and public
health.

Through the years many weight
reducing fads and fallacies ahve been
practiced such as:

Egg diet,

Green Vegetable diet.

Banana diet.

Three Day Prune diet,

All Meat diet,

High Fat diet.

Grapefruit diet,

High Protein diet, etc.,

These diets are self prescribed and
leave out important nutrients. Most
special foods are expensrve.
monotonous in taste, encourage bad
eating habits, pn'JVide food which are
high in circlesterol, cannot be
maintained for along time and are very
inadequate so that only ha rrri can
result it continued for long. Although
the list of such food fallacres is long
here are some examples;

FALLACY: Margarine has less
calories than buffer.

both margarine and butter is the same.

FALLACY:Weight Watcher's

family members should participate.

differences in age and physical
activity. Also it is not advisable that all

dried beans and dried peas. These
legumes are good and inexpensive
sources of protein, minerals and
vrtaniins.

FALLACY: White shelled eggs are

more nutritive than yellowshetfed

eggs.

nothing to do with its nutritive value
but it is due to the breed of the hen.

Carbohydrates are important because
they are good sources of energy, spare
proteins for tissue building and repair,
and also may be valuable sources of
Vitamins and minerals. The Food and
Nutrition Board, National Academy of
Sciences, National Research Council
recommends that a normal adult
person should get 100 gm. ol
carbohydrate daily.

carbonated beverage has 80 calories.

FALLACY: Water has calories and
you should avoid drinking.

COMMENT: Water has no calories
and it is very irnportanl to drink 68
glasses of water or other liquids daily.

There are many fallacies other than
mentioned above. Although many
crash diets promise rapid weight toss
out they are dangerous to the health by
producing anemias, increasing
cholesterol level of blood, and creating
protein, mineral and vitamin
deficiency.

It is very important to keep your
weight in the normal range by eating
three regular balanced meals daily
including the Four Basic Food Groups:

1. Milk Group

2. Meat Group

3. Bread and Cereal Group
4. Vegetable and Fruit Group

Choose foods which are enjoyed
and easily obtained. Sweets, fats and
Oils can be added for extra calories to
fit your caloric need. Participate in
some kind of moderate exercrse. Take
small servings and team to say "No" to
seconds. Avord food fads and be sure
the kind and choice of diet be
prescribed and supervised by your
pliysrcian and consulted by a qualified
nutritionist.

Good rrulrrtiori is the best way to
protect your health, weight control,
and provrde energy, fitness,
maintenance and pleasure.
