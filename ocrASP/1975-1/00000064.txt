ollege is college, or so the
saying goes. But, having seen
1 the inside and outside of two
colleges in an equal number of years, I
can safely say that the difference
between two schools is like the
difference between two countries. The
schools I am speaking of are, your
favorite concrete palace, SUNY
Albany, and that big Ivy League in the
sky, Cornell University. After spending
my freshman year at SUNYA, I
transferred to Cornell in order to
pursue my educational ambition.

My reasons for transferring were
purely academic During my year at
Albany I was in the Allen Center,
studying mainly the social sciences,
and by chance stumbled across an
environmental studies course which
interested me enough to make me

interests at heart I decided that the

They are all different colors, sizes, and
shapes, and as an extra added
attraction, most of them are not
connected together under one roof.
(This does present a problem when it
rains.) Needless to say, I spent my first
week here totally lost and wishing I
were back where the world grew in
squares and everything looked alike.

But the trauma passed when, after
much searching, I found my dorm and
eventually my room. Cornell housing
is much more generous with its space
than Albany is. You must remember
the room you had as a freshman,
bunkbeds and extra roommate
included. A room as big as that, maybe
bigger, is what I have all to myself. It's a
great place to study, if you're into that
kind of thing.

Otherwise, for their studying
pleasure, Cornell has provided its
students with six, yes six, different
libraries. (There are probably more

agriculture school at Cornell would be
the best place to get a “good
education" in environmental studies.
That being my main consideration at
the time, and assuming of course that
"college is college", I thought Cornell
would be nothing more than school in
a different place. I was dreadfully
mistaken.

The first thing that hitme was the size
of the place. Comell is BIG. There are
approximately one hundred separate
buildings on the campus proper, not
counting service buildings, athletic
buildings, fraternity houses, and
several little laboratories hidden out in
the woods, just to give you an idea. I
used to think it was a long walk from
Colonial Quad to the gym. Here,
people walk at least that far to get to
their first class.

However, there is a good side to this
abundance of space and structures.
No two buildings look exactly alike.

that I haven't found yet.) But even all
six can'tbeat the SUNYA library for the
centerofaction on a Wednesday night.

Academics at Cornell are of a
somewhat different type than those at
Albany. The N.Y.S. College of
Agriculture, one of the largest schools
within the university, is a landvgrant
college. That means research, and lots
of it. This results in Cornell being a
more scienceoriented university,‘
where Albany is more well-rounded in
itsdisciplines. [can remember hearing
many heated discussions in the
SUNYA dining halls concerning
corrupt politicians, the condition of the
country, the condition of man, man's
reasons for being, and just about any
othe humanistic issue.

At a Comell lunch table I hear
people talking about enzyme
concentrations, rate differentials, the
physiology of the turtle, why blood is
red, and how eightoutof ten pine trees

died after being exposed to
perfluorobutyltetrahydrafuran. I can‘ t
even say the word, let alone talk
about it at lunch. In cases
like this, I think scientific research is
going a bit too far.

Probably the most popularquestion I
have been asked is, "Do you think
Cornell is harder than Albany?" My
immediate response is, "Oh, god yes!",
but when I think about it, I really don't
know'.‘ The Cornell Ag School is
definitely harder than the Allen
Center, but I would imagine that the
bio majors at Albany go through just
about as much grief as the bio majors
at Cornell. The Allen Center wasn‘t a
free ride, as it appeared to some
people, but it did leave a lot more time
for living than the courses I’m taking
here.

In general I think there is more
pressure here, and I think Cornell is a
stricter school than Albany. The rules
and regulations regarding courses
and programs, drop—add, switching
courses, transfer credits, etc., are alot
tighter. And, although it is not much
bigger than Albany in student
population, it seems to be a lot more
impersonal in its dealings with the
students. As in any school there is
altogether too much red tape, but
Cornell must be worse than most.

As for the students themselves, they
are whatmakes Cornell the school that
it is, and as yet, Idon'tsee myself fitting
into the picture at all. Cornell, as
"anyone who is anyone" knows, is the
Ivy League. Now just what does that
mean? Well, there is a lot of strange-
lookrng plant life growing up the sides
of the buildings, but Ivy League is more
than that. And somehow, I don't think
I'll ever know what the "more" is. I
think it has somethingto dowith  . .my

an Ivy Leaguer to believe one, and
Comell has a lot of them.

The vast majority of Cornell students
are very serious about
their work. In contrast, the other
1% are only rather serious (the typical
Albany student). I fall into this
category, being only serious enough to
serve the purpose. When people get so
caught up in their work that they lose
their perspective, and their sonse of
priorities becomes distorted, they lose
touch with the real world. This has
resulted in a number humanoids
inhabiting this campus. Albany hasiis
hurnanoids, but Cornell seems to have
more than its share.

In the process of 'getting an
education, losing his or her
perspective, and generally losing his
or hermind, the typical Cornell student
usually ends up speaking a new
language, similar to English, but With it
little of the absentminded professor

becomes, in Cornelltan, “isn't it
conceivable that there is a possibility,
no matter now slight, but nevertheless
a definite, existing possibility of

sense of humor on yours. /

isstssippi began operating a
Mracially segregated system of
higher education, according
to a recent Justice Department
complaint, with the chartering of the
University of Mississippi way back in
1844. And even though a federal
court ordered black students admitted
to the state’s all white schools in 1962,
the Justice Department has charged
that Mississippi schools have
remained essentially segregated ever
since they first opened their doors.

But Mississippi does not stand alone
in perpetuating racial segregation in
higher education.

This February marks the second
anniversary ofa court order requiring
the Department of Health, Education,

nd Welfare (HEW) to press for
desegregation in ten state school
systems.

Furthermore, a recent report by the
Southern Education Foundation (SEF)
has expanded that number, and
charged that 19 states have separate
higher education systems for whites
and blacks.

Two of the original ten states,
Mississippi and Louisiana, are the
objects of suits filed by the lustice
Department designed to force
desegregation.

Eight other states‘Florida,
Arkansas, Georgia, Maryland, North
Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania,
and Virginia—shave filed
desegregation plans accepted by

 

HEW.

The lustice Department is
involved in a desegregation suit in the
eleventh state, Tennessee.

But in the eight additional states
listed by SEE—Alabama, Delaware,
Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, South
Carolina,Texasand WestVirgmia (no
official federal action in the form of
suits or HEWrmonriored
desegregation planning has occured.

The SEF report said the 19 states
operate schools where 2.6 million
students are enrolled.

While 50,000 students attended 35
black-only schools in the 19 states in
1954, the report said, whites comprise
5-10% of the 100,000 students now
enrolled in those colleges, The report
calculatedthat blacks currently make
up more than 5% of the 2.5 rriilfiorr
students attending formerly all white
schools.

Inch Toward
Desegregation 

According to the report, the gap
between the percentage of blacks in
the general population and the
percentage in public higher education
begins early—proportionately fewer
blacks than whites graduate from high
school. The gap then “grows
progressively wider," said the report.

While 15% of the 90 million people
in the 19 states are black, blacks
account for ten percent of the public
college students, four percent of the
undergraduate degree recipients, two

percent of the graduate and
professional school enrollment, and
less than one percent of the doctoral
dog tee recipients, the report said.

The SEE report further noted that
racial discrimination extends through
faculty and staff hiririgs and includes
unequal pay scales.

While blacks account for less than
two percent of the staff at some
predominantly white schools, whites
corrmionly make up 2050‘s of the
staffs of predominantly black schools.

Instructors at a formerly all-black
Arkansas school receive $2000 less
than instructors at the predoiiiinciiitly

white main campus, the report
charged. Assistant professors receive
$3500 less than their counterparts,
associate professors $5000 less, and
full professors $7000 less.

Composition of university governing
bodies is largely restricted by race, the
report claimed. Black participation
ranges from zero in Virginia,
Louisiana, and Alabama to the "high"
ratios of two out of 1 3 Maryland and six
out of 32 in North Carolina.

"Simple faimess—as well as respect
for the law—requires substantially
greater contribution from minorities in
these important planning and
decision-making roles," the report
said.

The lustice Department actions in
both the Mississippi and Louisiana
desegregation suits came at the
request of HEW, which was itself
prodded into action by a court suit.

In a classic civil—rights decision,
Adams vs. Richardson, a US District
Court judge ordered HEW in February
1973 to obtain desegregation plans for
the public higher education systems in
ten states.

That suit charged the federal
government with failure to implement
Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
which forbids discrimination on the
basis of race in federally assisted
programs.

Asa result, HEW asked for, received
and approved desegregation plans for
eight of the ten states.

Louisiana, the ninth state, refused to
life what HEW considered adequate
plans and instead, in December 1973,
filed a suitaccusing HEW of exceeding
federal guidelines in its desegregation
orders.

HEW then asked the lustice
Department to sue Louisiana, which it
did in March 1974, charging that the
state maintained “an unlawful dual

system of higher education based on
race" which tended to “deprive black
students attending state supported
schools and prospective black
students of equal protection of the laws
and equal educational opportunities."

The tenth state, Mississippi, filed
desegregation plans which HEW
termed "good" for its four-year
colleges, though inadequate for junior
colleges. In order to pressure
Mississippi into desegregating its
entire system, HEW recently asked the
lustice Department to join a 1970 suit
designed to desegregate’Mississippi's
two landgrant colleges with a suit
requiring desegregation of the entire
system.

In its action the lustice Department
asked the court to prohibit state
officials from continuing to operate a
racially segregated system of higher
education and to order them to
develop and implement a plan to
desegregate the system.

Some civil rights activists have
criticized the suit, saying the Ford
adminis'ration has purposely by-
passed the more forceful action of a
fund cut-off. Sources close to HEW,
however, have contended that since
the suit is primarily designed to force
action on the junior college level, a
fund cutoff would unfairly penalize
the state's senior colleges.

The Mississippi suit affects more
than 72,000 students enrolled in the
state's eight four-year colleges and
unrversrties, medical center and 16
junior colleges.
