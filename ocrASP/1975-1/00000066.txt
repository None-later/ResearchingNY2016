‘ From  Capitol:

Lights..-4Carn_era,
No Action

by David Lerner

New York l’osl columnist Carl Rowan.
writing about the decision by Boston
University students to cancel the speaking
engagement of Ronald Zeigler said that
notoriety sells. ‘.‘I could write a thousand
columns of unmatched genius.“ he wrote. but
“I‘d be more famous if I was arrested smoking
pot in the White House.”

The concept of the salability of notoriety
ties in directly with the advent of the television
candidate. That a candidate is a winner
regardless of his political appeal if he carries
well on television was a popular battle cry
which found its zenith in former President
Nixon‘s return to power in I968. Television
personalities. especially political leaders. are
supposed to gain instant notoriety. due
exclusively to the fact that the face appeared
on television. Undoubtedly. a man like Dan
Rather is as popular because he carries
powerfully across television. as he is because
of his journalistic talents.

Television per' ""ies are ,, to
attract a following. Once someone appears on
television people must expect that he will no
longer appear in the real world. and that if he
does. we had all better get a glimpse of the
human solar eclipse.

(iovcmor Carey made an unprecedented
appearance on the Albany State campus on
Friday. As he walked out of the Campus
Center Ballroom 'down the steps that
thousands of st'udc'r'r'ts have walked down. into
the Lobby 319d out thc‘doorathere should have
been the trir of tmre’ality about'the entire
incident. Television celebrities. especially the
u - nu- -

.s

Gaye or of ew York. simply do not walk

,' 1‘ do teps into .ihe Campus Center Lobby. .,
.lssed on'the notoriety theory. the usual

throng of students who frequent the Campus

Center at any given moment in the afternoon ‘

should have rushed to his side to see a living

celebrity. But they didn‘t.

There' were a‘ few currous Peeping-Toms
who walked over to ﬁnd out why there were'so
many jackets and ties on a university campus.
but there was no rush to see the Governor. The
press in fact. the people wearing all thejackets
and ties. looked sort of foolish jumping and
hopping around this short. overweight man
sweating TV make—up.

Hugh Carey is by now quite a notorious
figure. but to the students of Albany State. he
was a misﬁt on the campus. He didn‘t belong.
and as far as they were concerned. they were
not going to lend credibility to his visit by
swarming around him like a pack of rock and
roll groupies. On Friday. Hugh Carey did not
play in Peoria. and the theory of notoriety
began to go into its death throes.

There is certainly nothing mystical about
SUNYA students. nor are they especially
enlightened. but note that the last television
politician to gain an aura merely because ofhis
status was Richard Nixon.

What failed to happen on Friday in many
ways was far more dramatic than what did
happen. Carey. in his role as ceremonial chief
of state. addressed a no-stttdcnts-allowed
gathering of international trade leaders and
said nothing important. He spoke of leading

New York into a period of agricultural

aggr ' of a labor-intensive
economy. all the things which‘bring up bile in
a normal listener. Robert Laird. the
Govemor‘s press secretary. was sound asleep
through. rnost‘ol' the speech. The Governor
promised that one day New York would lead
the nation in something other than taxes. but
the group, of‘ economists gathered in the
Ballroom failed to see the humor.

Nothing much happened on this campus on
Friday. and that alone may spell the most
important advance in enlightened politics
since America returned a verdict~ofguilty on
the whole process.

Looking Into

the Crystal Ball

by Robert Mayer

A Republican President is forced to resign
his office . in disgrace. A Republican
Administration witnesses each month a steady
rise in unemployment. ,A Republican
President accepts calmly the news that a
majority of Americans have littlc.confidence
in his abilities to tackle the problems of
inflation and recession. A Republican party
suffers from low morale. diminishing funds.
and uncertainty as to its role in the future of
American politics. All thispoints to the logical
conclusioir that the Democrats will recapture
the big enchilada. But not so.

Senator Henry Jackson announced his
candidacy last week. his hair dyed. face lifted.
and immediately was hailed as the front
runner. Of course being the only announced
candidate furthers that image. Yet Jackson is
recognized by his party as the man to beat and
nothing could more accentuate the dilemma of
the Democratic Party.

Jackson with over a million dollars in his
campaign vault. an enormous campaign
machinery. and constant publicity has done
little. if anything. to wet the appetite of the
electorate. He is a drab looking politician.
who speaks in a monotone equalled by few.
and if he doesn‘t rise above his |4% high water
mark. he is very likely to be the Hubert
Humphrey of I976.

In addition. Jackson cannot shed his die-
hard hawkish image on Vietnam in time to
appease the lcft-uf—ccnter coalition that is sure
to dominate and control the ‘76 convention.

Still. the left-of—eenter candidates are faring
no better. Their problem can be attributed in
part to where they are coming from. mainly
Congress. Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana.

A TTEN TI ON SENIORS ! ﬁr

* senior week is coming!

Frank Church of Idaho. Muskie of Maine.
Congressman Udall of Arizona. are all part of
a Congress that a whopping 82% of the nation
holds more responsible for the country‘s ills
than their President. To make matters even
worse. Muskie rtcknowlegcd the obvious last
week when he said the the Presidential
sweepstakes has as many as twenty
contenders. Hardly an asset to the individual
that hopes to get the party nod.

In a normal year one could assume that a
first term Republican President would be a
sure bet for his party‘s nomination. But
normal years are more and more like relics of
the past. Ford was not nominated by the
convention norelected by the people. The only
things right now that bar an open struggle for
the Republican ticket are Nelson Rockefeller
and a deep tradition among Republicans to be
courteous to their president.-

With the economy sinking the way it is. it is
only months before the Republicans‘ search
for a candidate is officially sanctioned by
party stalwarts. If Ford‘s decision on amnesty
did not alienate right wing members of his
party. his 52 billion dollar dcbt sure did. It is
that right of center core that controls the
convention. . .
ooooooooo
Howard Baker has already said the

nomination is open. Elliot Richardson can get

a campaign moving in-fourwccks. andrRonald
Reagan only has to sneeze in the right
direction. A Baker-Richardson ticket in I976
would he a nightmare to Democrats.

With a huge proportion of the American
voters now identifyng themselves as
Independents. a third and even a fourth party
candidate appears more likely each day.
