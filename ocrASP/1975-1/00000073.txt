worthwhile) for work in the Student Association.

' lt ts no secret that many students receive stipends to supplement the time they ut
into their groups. Except for the top three elected leaders ofS.A.. no one receives mgre
than $560 for the entire year. Most receive less than $50 per semester, a token gratuit

at best. but nonetheless a sum greatly appreciated by those that put in the long hours i:
deserve it. It is also no secret that the members of Central Council do not receive
stipends. Then one possible reason for their irrational behavior is apparent' if the
cant have. then no one else can have either. Maturity was never a trademark ofCentrai

Council.

groups ﬁnd themselves next year with less committment and less participation. there i
only one place to focus the frustration, one place to put the blame. With Council‘

their elected leaders will most surely proliferate. We cannot blame them.

And Stealing From Peter

lhe. Board of Directors ofthc Faculty-Student Association will hear a proposal fora
board increase often percent when they meet this Tuesday. Maybe they will insist they
be given moreloptrons. maybe they‘ll ask that all losing FSA operations be cut or
pukith they‘ll jtlSl decide that Director Zahm knows best. sit back. and vote for ihe
11 e.

 

Realistically. anyone in Zahm‘s position would have no motive to search ottt l' '
to cut. especially cuts that would be inconvenient. Zahm is a very bus m'in p"mic?
would have to work doubly bard while looking for places to cut. Since he liti 'ht blL
to get the board increase and since whatever money is being wasted is serbvin is“ 
good purpose for someone it could seem far easier, and from the ad ntiriistrativ’;I 
ol View. more reasonable.to get money from the most convenient source: the studpcnls

   
  
  
  
 
  
   

. We realize that the board operation is most of the business. but a ten percent hike-is-
simply too muclt. It should he cut down as much as possible. and there are plenty of
losses to be eliminated.
