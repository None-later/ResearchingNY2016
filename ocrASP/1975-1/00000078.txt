The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) came
into existence in I834 asa division of the War
Department. At that time according to the
Bureau. Indians were deﬁned as sovereign
nations withwhom the government entered
intopeacc treaties and later enforced promises
to ceaseghostilities.

In l849. the Bureau was transferred to the
Department of the Interior. As a result. the
Bureau’s relationship wrth the Indian became
deﬁned in terms of the administration of
Indian land. the discharge of treaty
obligations and respect for that land. and the
implementation. of those duties owed a
militarily “conquered” people.

With ,the granting of U.S. citizenship in
I924. still another redefinition was affected.
Responsibilities were broadened to include
both the discharge of previous treaty
obligations and the administration of
programs created by Congress to give the.
“new citizens"proper training.

The BIA must be viewed as a system
extending into every dimension of Native
existence and in every element of Native
activity. The BIA is the government. the
banker. the teacher. social worker; it runs the
employment service. vocational and job
training office. and land development; it is the
patron of-thcarts. ambassador to and from the
outside world. also “guardian. protector“ and
spokesman. It deﬁnes who is Indian and re-
arranges tribal entities at will.

The Interior‘s other jurisdictions include the
Bureau of Mines. the National Park Service.
the Bureau of Commerical Fisheries, and the
Bureau of Land Management. The conﬂicts

 

‘ groups and theirefiiliations. Now howcen the

BlA‘be eervin i'theb‘e'stintereets of Native
People while existing in and perpetuating such
a framework? . ‘

Ironically. many Indian People tolerate
their present stagnant and unjust status in
their relationship with the Federal
Government because the BIA stands between
“legal” recognition and the dismissal of Native
People as a distinct racial and cultural entity.
The BIA continues to play the role of
assimilator through education. health services
and the granting of land use leases for large
corporations.

For example. in many BIA schools Indian
children are forbidden to use their native
languages. to wear their hair in the traditional
manner. or to assert their Indian heritage in
any way.

Recently. BIA hospitals and health care
centers were found sterilizing Native Women.
many times without their consent. because
they were “unfit to be mothers.” Doctors have
found it in their jurisdiction to play social
judge and decidewho is fit and who is not fit to
have babies. .

Native People. although they live on
designated land areas called reservations DO
NOT own that land and have little or no say
with regard to its use and future. The only
thing the BIA finds lndianscompctent enough
to do in land matters is the selling of it. The
BIA acts as a trustee for the Indian People.
deciding what is done with the land and to

whom exploratory permits are granted to:'

usually those other departments in the
Interior.

But it is the citizens of the United States
through their negligence and ignorance of
Native Affairs that allow this smothering to
continue. ‘which results many times in
violence. You needn't look across the seas to
find people oppressed by colonialism and
imperialism: it‘s happening right now in your
on backyard. Empty yourselves. Look. Listen.
Experience and let the New Day begin.

Last Friday night, an unidentified student
had the misfortune to fall through a patch of .
thin ice on the campus pond. The water.
luckily. was shallow and the student excaped
with only a case of “cold feet.“ The University
Police were not notified of the incident.
Somehow. however. the Campus Center
lnfonnation Desk was informed. This caused
the ice skating condition chart. there. to be‘
changed from satisfactory to “swimming
conditions.“ This was unfortunate. for had
more snow been cleared from the ice. ice
skating conditions would have been perfect
last week-end on the wellfrozcn areas of the
pond. The problem is not in our system of
communications. but in the pond itsclf.

Last week-end a fairly large number of
students did use the campus pond for various
recreational activities: ice skating. cross
country skiing and “traying.” as well as just
trudging around through the snow feeling
strange to be standing on water.

There are some dangers involved in this.
however. As our hapless Friday night
wanderer found. the pond does not freeze
uniformly. So. despite the recent sub-freezing
temperatures it is possible to “fall into" the
misfortune of wet feet. This danger can bc

 

ma Pond

eliminated , by knowing some of the
fundamental ecological factors affecting the
pond.

Most people have noticed that the
northwest "neck" of the pond never freezes -
cold as it may get. This is for three reasons.
One. drainage pipes carrying the salt from the
roads and parking lots empty there.
Consequently. the pond at that point has a
higher salt concentration than the rest (some
800 times greater). Salt water frcczcsat lower
temperatures. Second. this water is circulated
to the ponds north side and overﬂow drain
making these parts more resistant to freezing.
Third. underground streams enter the pond
along the northern and western banks. These
streams never freeze (due to an insulatory
effect of the ground) and upon entering the
pond serve to Weaken the ice around them.

As can be seen. to simply walk on the pond
at random (or worse. at night) is dangerous.
However. if the winter activities are confined
to the south and eastern areas of the pond.
which are shallow and fresh water. it is
comparatively safe. With normal Albany
weather. this part of the pond will remain
frozen far into March or April. By simply
using common scnscand precautions the pond
may be used to a much greater extent.
