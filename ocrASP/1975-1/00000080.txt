Women’s Sports

by Michael Phillips

On Tuesday night the SUNYA
women‘s basketball team suffered a
discouraging defeat to Russell Sage
on Sage‘s homo = court. with Sage
outscoring SUNYA 72-33. Russell
Sage took advantage of their
knowledge of their smaller home
courtby applying a full court player-
to-player press. Albany State was
hampered by the fact that acourtof
such dimensions prohibited the use
of their free-break offense. Albany
also suffered: fromlthc absence of
Dorothea Brown (due to the flu) and
'Cathy Dower (injured)._ ' Despite
these adversities. the SUNYA team
refused to throw in the towel. The
lopsided scoredid not reflect the true
nature of the contest as Albany shot
only 17% from the floor while

Imagine an order of
22.000 priests and brothers In
73 countries around the world. a
(That's a pretty big family.)

But that's what the
Saieslans of St. John Bosco i
are all about — a large family
of community-minded men
dedicated to the service of '
youth. (And no one gets lost.)

Russell Sage was hitting 28%. Beth
Sciurba lead Russell Sage with 25
points while Wendy (lath paced the
losers with IO points. Putting in it
strong effort under the boards for
Albany was Vicki Girko.

The women had their tips and
downs as the defense came up with
several steals and the offense showed
its ability to work together. but
bright spots were often overshad ow-
ed by an inability to convert the easy
basket or hit the open player.

The women are ho me Saturday. at

Can the Varsity Women's SiVim

maybe no. but they will try in their

In Italy In the 1800's a chance meeting between a poor
priest and a street urchin served to create a movement of such
success that it is still growing today. Don Bosco became the
priest who brought youth back from the streets — and
back to God.

He reasoned that a program of play. learn and pray would
make useful citizens of the world. He crowded out avll with
reason. religion and kindness in a (what was then unheard of)
atmosphere of family.

The Ideals of St.John Bosco are still with us today. His
