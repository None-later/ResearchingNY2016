The Albany State Great Danes varsity basketball team had its
hopes for the l974-75 SUNY Conference Crown dealt a severe blow
Tuesday. as the Red Dragons of Oneonta burned the Danes 66-51.
The loss drops the Danes‘ record to 10-7, 5-2 in Conference play.

Albany‘s NCAA and SUNY-
Crown hopes now rest in the hands
of the Buffalo State Bengals who
play undefeated top ranked
Brockport on February 25. The
Danes must win their last 4 SUNY
games (Potsdam tonight. Oswego
Tomorrow. at Plattsburgh Wednes—
day. and the big one versus
Brockport on February 22) to have
any hopes of winning the crown.

When asked to evaluate Buffalo
State‘s chances versus Brockport.
Sauers said. “I think they have as
good a. starting five as Brockport.
and possibly a slightly better bench.
After all. you just have to believe."

“Our objective against Oneonta
was to force their playmaker (guard)
Kevin Croutier (4 pts) out of the
game.“ said Albany varsity basket-
ball coach Doctor Richard Saucrs.
“When we succeeded in getting him
out of there in the second half. we
were able toclosc the gap'to 3 points.
but then Oneonta called time out
and reinserted him. After that.
thanks to our 20 some-odd turnovers
and poor play. they opened itup and
we were finished.“

The gamcopencd with a Jim Coon
(6 pts) basket for Oneonta. and con-
tinued with turnovers by both teams
(22 for Albany. [5 for Oneonta.)

Albany fell behind l9-8. midway

through the half. as Steve Blackmun V

led the Dragons with 6 points. (8 for
the game).

the Danes appeared to wake up.

before Onconta‘s Ralph'Christian

Christian and pulled off it perfect
give and go with Bob Audi (l0 pts).
then followed with a basket 20
seconds later to make it a 20- IB grime
with 3:26 to play.

Jack Dalton (20 pts.7 for 7 from
the field) hit two layups and John

open it up ugian. but the Danes
countered with two baskets by Gary

buzrcr to make it it 25-24 half.

Oneonta opened a 7 point lead
early in the second half. and
successfully held off several Albany
comeback attempts. largely thanks
to a successful full court press and

penetrable.

Pups Win

by Mike Piekarski

Amos Taylor‘s l5—foot jumper with two and a half minutes left in
the game. put the Albany junior varisty basketball team ahead to
stay. as they rallied in the second half and hung on to post a 64-58
victory Tuesday night over Oneonta on the Red Dragons' home
court. The win got the Pups back on the winning track after last
weekend‘s loss to the Siena j.v. and left the Bob Lewis-coached squad
with to victories in l3 outings this season.

Taylor pumped in his crucial l5-
footer from the left side to put
Albany ahead for the last time at 56-
55. less than a minute after Oneonta
had taken a three point lead withjust
over three minutes to play. Taylor
found his way into the spotlight
again when he was fouled with If
seconds to play with the Pops
leading by one. He calmly sank btitli
shots. fully aware that one miss
would give the Red Dragons rt
golden opportunity to win or tie the
game.

At 2 PM. today there will be

This meeting will follow Sunday's
stormy emergency session of SA‘s

solutcly wrong Currau‘s charge that
he had failed to make belt-tightcriirig
suggestions concerning FSA. “I‘ve
cut personnel down to the bone." he
said. Zahm praised the l‘SA‘s work
by comparing the "I391. increase in
hon rd since I967 with a I97‘Jirjump
in food costs“ during the saute
period. In referring to Mr. Dobcy.
Zrihm claimed that “we don‘t need

spcct the l‘SA.

According to a source close to
Zahm. the FSA Director is not tiri-
duly worried about having tlie$ IRS.-

would merely borrow money from
an outside bank. at a one-halfper—
cent increase in interest.

The bill affecting the student
members on the l'SA board aroused
those members and they attack SA
l’rcsidcrit l’ut Curran for first rcvcrrl-
ing the rcsigutrtioti scheme in
l‘ridrty's ASI’. without talking to
Board members beforehand. Stu-
dcril l.cw Burrol l-SA said. "l'rii not

whether Cotrricil has the legal right
to tire Board nicriibcrs.

('trrrrru admitted he had used had

tactics in Council; ‘I should have sat

for accepting too easily the figures of
FSA Director Norbet erhm who
supposedly favors a board increase.
Said Curran. “I say make all
operations of FSA profitable. not
just Quad food service . . . rt Board
increase would unfairly hit just Quad
residents.“ A committc of the Board
of Directors suggested. ti niong other
things. raising the charge on the un-
profitable check-cashing operation-
to 25c and upping l’ritroon Lounge

Much of the above controversy

students paying still more for their

A&S Dean Search Ending

by Im‘id Winzclberg

Search Committee members have
reported that the twenty-onc-month
old search for a ricw Arts and
Sciences Dean may soon bccndirig.

The search which began over a
year ago with the departure of
former Dean I. Moycr llttnsbergcr.
has been spearheaded by a com-
mittee of faculty and students ap-
pointed by Executive Vicc»l’rcsidcnt
of Academic Affairs l’liillip
Sirotkiii. The committee of seven-
teen. currently composcd of four
students and thirteen faculty
riicnibcrs. started witli close to 200
candidates for the position. have
now narrowed the selection to it
handful. Scerctary of tliccoiiiruiitcc
Robert McFarland rcvcalcd. "()n
the timetable that we luer projected.
it will lie about two weeks before iri-
vittitioris for the candidates to come
on campus will be given out. and the
names of these candidates can then
be made public".

Committee members have stated
scvertrl difficulties involved in the
search that can be attributed to its
slow progress. Cornrnitlcc Chairper-
son Richard O'Ncil explained that
his committee does not want to iti-

tet'fcrc with SUNYA‘s Presidential

caused somcdelay recently. In l973.

been several changes in the com-
mittee membership. another search

it "large student tornovcr" in

patience with the committee‘s

The former Dean ofthc College of
Arts and Sciences 1. Meyer
llunsbcrgcr. resigned in May of I973
amidst much controversy. The
former SUNYA administrator‘s
resignation had been called for by
both faculty‘and students during a
flurry ofactivity that included a sit-
in at President Benezct‘s office.

Hunsberger was alleged to have if-
legally openod othcr‘s mail while he
occupied the post of Dean of Arts
and Sciences at the University of
Massachusetts before coming to this
campus. Here at SUN‘
Ilunsbergcr was charged with injec-
ting personal bias when dealing with
various administrative decisions. in-
clirding witholding funds and in-
fluencing tenure and promotions.
Following his resignation.
llunsbergcr was ofl'c red and
accepted the position of Provost of
the University ofOklrrhoma at Nor-
Illilll.

Candidates for Hunsberger‘s
\ttttitlicy have been considered frotn
schools representing runny parts of
the country. 'l'licsc candidates were
reached in scvcrttl ways; personal
phone calls and letters to faculty
colleagues. general announcement
mailings to all members of the Un-

tisements in the Chronicle oj'HI'g/ier

Despite their problcriis. the corn-
mittce now seems to be movingmore
steadily. thouin remaining extreme-
ly selective. towurd landing a con-
didtttc for the post. Chairperson

mittee have been keeping in close

with him this week to get plans laid
out for concluding the search.
