(ZNS) Do you. remember Siiter

Sourirepthe singing nun in I964 ,

recorded the hit ‘Dominique“'l

It turns out that the tax people are I

after her. .

Belgian tax collectors have in-
itiated proceedings against Sister
Sourire‘s superior, claiming that the
singing nun failed to pay “ en the
smallest installment“ on h r taxes
due. The tax people claim the singing
nun owes them at least l0.000
pounds.

In the meantime. the convent has
refused to open its doors to the
collectors. It says that Sister Sourire
is no longer one of their charges-—
that she quit after recording her hit
record—~and that they don't know
where: she went.

Bugs Bunny
Really Talks

(ZNS) Two Canadian scientists
are out with a study which indicates
that animals may be able to com-
municate with each other through
radio telepathy.

Doctors Digu Del Blanco and
Cesar Eomero-Sierra of Queens Un-
iversity in Ontario report they ahve
found that some animals literally
broadcast microwave signals with
their brains. -

In studies on rabbits. the
researchers found that the animals
emit distinct signals which can be
picked up by conventional

microwave radio receivers.

Del Blanco _and Romero-Sierra
report finding that these signals vary
in size and strength depending on the
stress the animals feel. '

They suggest that when one
animal emits a strong stress signal.
it‘s possible for other similar animals
to receive it. The doctors say this
radio telepathy may explain why one
cat is sometimes able to recognize
when another cat in the vicinity is
frightened or stressed.evcn when the
two animals are unable to seeorhear
each other.

Nerve Gases

(ZNS)The Pentagon. in its new
budget submitted to Congress. is
asking for $l25 million next year so
that it can develop and expand its
nerve gas arsenal.

The Army is requesting the major
share of the money so it can build a
nerve gas production facility capable
of turning out what are called
“binary nerve gases.“

Binary gases are two gases which,
by themselves. are relatively
harmless. They become fatally toxic.
however. as soon as they are mixed.

The Navy and Air Force haveask-
ed for additional funding so that

they can build binary nerve as
bombs. '

The Pentagon claims it wants to
produce nerve gas weapons for
defensive purposes only—so that
they can be stockpiled and used only
in the event another nation uses
them ﬁrst. The US. currently
stockpiled some 50 million pounds
of other chemical munitions.

The Boogeyman;

(ZNS) A study of fear has found
that children are usually not afraid
of the Boogeyman and ghosts.

Instead. et cutest es. of
killers. dying and the atom bomb. A
team of researchers from Californ'u

tion that they asked second-through

Food Recycled as Campus Soil Enricher

by Beverly Helm

Last summer. Kathy Eastman and
Roger Rodiek were hired by
SUNYA‘s Plant Department to
begin a campus composting project.
In this process. food waste is taken
from the quad cafeterias and
brought to a composting site. where
it decomposes with the aid of
bacteria. Later. the soil nutrient
derived from the compost will be
used on Albany‘s campus as a soil
cnricher and to help stop erosion.

SOMATs. on the dock areas
behind the cafeterias. grind the food
wastes and mix them with water.
(The SO MAT. according to Peter
Haley of SUNYA‘s Food Service, is
a “variation of a home compactor.")
The ground material is then
deposited into a hopper. The
(irounds Department sends garbage
trucks to pick up the material to take
it to the Fuller Road composting
site. The site is behind the (irounds
Maintenance Facility owned by the
University.

Now the actual decomposition

process that will form compost takes
place. Bacteria and microorganisms
go to work on the ground foSd.
These organisms need oxygen and
water to live. The mixture must be
from 40 to 70 percent water to allow
the bacteria to break down the food.
and large amounts of oxygen must
be present.

Roger Rodick, part of SUNYA‘s
Environmental Studies Program at
SUNYA. explained why this aerobic
decomposition method is used.
(Aerobic simply means that the
bacteria require oxygen to live.) An
anaerobic process (not requiring ox-
ygen). says Rodiek. “produces foul
odors and is a much slower process.
'l'hclowcrtempcratures produced by
an anaerobic process are responsible
for the longer decomposition time.
The end result is a lower quality
product. The aerobic process is
much tnore efficient. It gives off
more heat. and the higher
temperatures support different kinds
of bacteria that are more efficient.“

The composting project has not

really changed the garbage disposal
methods of the quad cafeterias—
only the way garbage is picked up by
the Grounds Department. On some
runs. trucks take only SOMAT
material; on others. they pick up
paper. A5 paper is hard to break
down. none is included with the food
..wastes.

The campus composting program
is a result of a group called the En-
vironmental Decisions Commission.
This group is composed of ad-
ministrators. faculty. students. and
non-teaching professionals who
meet once every two weeksto discuss
environmental problems on Albany
State's campus. The personnel ofthc
Environmental Office have worked
together to clean up the campus
pond. install “silent policemen"
bumps on campus roadways. and
clean up campus waste through cont-
postingand utilization ofcompost as
fertilizer. The goal of the en-
vironmental people is to make
SUNYA a self-contained communi-
ty. us an example to the community
outside the University.
