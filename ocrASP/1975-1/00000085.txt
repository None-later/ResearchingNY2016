"convicted wings, 'J.’ bu. commenting; on the contemporary  rial nature of the
'. presidency. ' ' . . _ “ 3 " "

 

' Todr't he Faculty-Student A 'ociationvrneets and will probably decide on the size of
' the , I rd hike. Thatther‘e will be‘a hike isclear. and quitebasonable in light of the
economy. Despite the taste of institutional food, it is and will still be a good buy, and
our institution is not significantly better or worse than the average. 1 . 7

There‘s a lot of confusion about the hike and FSA in general. SA has voted to
withdraw their Sl80.000lloan to FSA if there is a hike, to have a “professional
attritinistrative consultant” study FSA, and to remove the student members if they vote
for thehike. FSA Director E. Norbert Zahm has said ina recent memo that “in orderto
cover increased expenses in most every category [in the contract meal part of the FSA
budget] and to. produce a very reasonable net income a ten percent increase is not
unreasonable." It has been pointed out that a corporation the size of F SA needs a net
income of a few percent to keep on the safe side of unexpected developments.

'SA proposes that the increase be cut by eliminating the Iossesthat some FSA
operations create. Less in the red than ever. eliminations could save FSA possibly a few
thousand dollars.

Some there can be no question about. The barbershop loses money, and there is no
excuse for that. A proﬁtable barbershop might be acceptable, but there are better uses
for that space. Among the suggestions are a head shop (surely proﬁtable), a liquor shop
(the same). a grocery store, a ticketron office. record co-op, or a fancy hair stylist. We
ﬁrmly believe that every singletone of these uses would serve more students and be
more proﬁtable than the barbershop. The Patroon Room loses money. and that
doesn‘t make sense. Administrators and faculty use it far more than students. and are
far more able thanstudents to bear the cost of price increases. Bowling can easily be
made prof itable. and the cafeteria could raise prices a few percentage points and still be
quite reasonable. ‘ V

None of these are going to make a huge difference to the board contracters since
they‘re still the backbone of FSA. but every little bit does help.

The Board of Directors must hold the line on an increase.

SA‘s threatened withdrawal is another matter. The one-half of one percent
difference between SA and an outside bank would mean about a thousand dollars to
FSA. As a weapon it is-pretty strong, and as such must be used carefully. The situation
with the board hike this year is not black-vand-white enough to merit the use of this
weapon. It is by no means clear that students would be exploited if there werea hike
over ﬁve percent; FSA's health, as trite as it may sound. is indeed in the interest of the
students.

...Curran's Rash

Student Association President Pat Curran has acted strongly in respone to the
threatened board hike. With Central Council, Vice President lra Birnbaum, and
Assistant Jay Miller, a host ofalternative proposalsand threats have come out ofS.A.,
all in an attempt to prevent what they saw as FSA “screwing” students. Theoretically.
this is admirable and is exactly what an honest. hard-working and imaginative
President should do.

But a few things went wrong on this issue. The threats against the student FSA
Board members were made without discussing the issue with them beforehand.
Nobody sat down with Director Norbert Zahm to hash it out thoroughly. In general.
decisions were hasty and rash. This has happened before with Curran. and has always
been our primary concern over his Presidency. it does not appear a continual problem
however, and it is believed he has executed his office responsibly. but it is hoped that
the students have seen the last of this sort of poorly planned behavior.

Errata

It was incorrectly reported in Friday's edition on page two that the Computer Center ended
the year with a surplus of over 51.000.000. The figure should have read $l00.000.

It was also incorrectly reported that there are “strict regulations against foreign students
working (tn-campus." it should have read “off-campus."On-cttmpus cmploymcttt does not ttced
tltc approval of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, while off-campus employment
does.

One Last Fix

Vietnam is in the rtch once again. it
continues to come back to create controversy.
This time, as previously. President Thieu
wants a “fix” in the form of300 million dollars
in additional aid. Just one more major aid
package we are told will pttt Vietnam on its
feet once and for all. Ofcourse that last shot of
aid is never finally injected because President
'l'hieu pcrsistsin weaning offthc U.S. ignored
iit this request, and perhaps to lend sotttc
objcctivity to it, is the fact that 1.3 hiiiiott
dollars in military aid for Vietnam is already
bttilt into President Ford‘s new budget for
ﬁscal 1976.

President l‘o rd scents willing to play 'l‘hicu‘s
