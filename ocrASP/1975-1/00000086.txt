—it makes life at the big university much more

bearable. Coming in from the cold Albany weather

into a room that’s warm and comfortable makes

living in the dorms more like home (it anything has

the properties to create such a deception).
Yet when the heat's oft or not working up to par, ’

the coldness of the campus sets in in a number of

ways. Many students complain, yet the reasons for

the inconveniences are known to few.The workings

of the SUNYA Power Plant are equally unknown. In

today's centerfold, we get a closer look at the place

where it all comes from.

A Survey of

' Thefts
on Campus

by the College Press Service
twas 2 am. when the woman
I walked down the hallway and
stood in front of her dorm
room. Odd—the door was aiar. She
pushed it open and stared at the
brightly lit room. Five minutes later she
assessed her losses at over $1000; her
stereo, radio and purse had all been
stolen.

Theft is the number. one crime on
college campuses, according to a
survey conducted last summer by the
lnsurance information lnstitute, which
studied crime statistics from 28 schools
across the country. The results of the
survey, however, were inconclusive,
since many crimes are not reported.
But generally, the following trends
were found:

Thefts are on the downswing.
According to the FBI there has been a
sharp decline over the last year in the
number of robberies, burglaries and
auto thefts on college campuses.

Smaller, more isolated colleges
seem to have less serious crime
problems: less theft, little violence and
less vandalism. Urban colleges, with

large student bodies, have the most
dilficulty. Apart from the exposure of
the urban colleges to "outsiders," no
attempt was made by the survey to
identify other factors leading to higher
crime rates on these campuses.

No matter what type of campus, the
most vulnerable area—and prime
crime target—is college dormitories,
where little effort is made by most
students to prevent larcenies. In fact,
one school reports that 90% of
larcenies in the dormitories occur
through open doors, and that forced
entries are rare.

"Students are their own worst
enemies," says campus policeman
Harvard
University. "l'hey neglect security
precautions, tail to question intruders
in dorms, prop open entrances that
should be kept locked, and-have a
lrustrating trust in the honesty of
others," says Hill.

Many students exhibit a reluctance
to report crimes. "In one recent case,"
observes the security director at an
Iowa school, "some students observed
a man carting stutl away from a dorm

llm t\ (5 -.

 

for two—and-ahalt hours before we
received a call." >

The nature of thefts varies
extensively. In some cases, there are
active student criminals. Art Holtorf,
:lireotor of safety for Washington State
Jniversity at Pullman, ended a crime
wave by apprehending one student
who stole over $30,000 in tape decks,
TVs and other items.

Campuses, as noted earlier, also act
as magnets for "outsiders" who steal
autos, bicycles and other easily
resaleable items. At the Clarmont
Colleges, CA, for instance, security
officers have found boys 13 or 14 years
old from the nearby town equipped
with bolt»cutters to snap locks on
bicycles.

At certain times during the semester
the crime rate is higher than usual.
New students are particularly
vulnerable to thefts betore they
become acclimated to their new
environment. They may bring
expensive stereo equipment, for
example, that would have been better
left at home, according to one campus
security officer. The number of crimes
also increases around holiday time,
especially Christmas.

Perhaps a prime lactor in the
decrease of thefts has been the recent
institution of effective crime programs.

At Ohio State University, for
instance, entering students are now
advised not to bring unnecessary,
expensive personal items to campus.

Sin City U'S'A'

Ann Arbor almost did it again.

A proposal to decriminalize
"victirnless crimes" like begging,
drunkeness and prostitution in Ann
Arbor, Ml was defeated by a narrow 6-
5 vote. All Republicans voted against
the measure and all Democrats and
Human Rights party members voted in
lavor.

"First the Human Rights-Democratic
coalition was responsible for Ann
Arbor becoming known as the dope
capital of the West (after passing an
ordinance providing for a maximum
$5 line for possession at marijuana),“
complained Republican lack
McCormick. "ll this passes, we'll
become known as Sin City, USA."

A publication, Operation Hipott, is

persuading students to lock doors.
Each dormitory has posted a sign, "A
ripoff is a Bummer," on which details of
thefts in the building are publicized.
Officials at that school think it has
encouraged more students to keep
their doors locked.

Most of the approximately 5000
bicycles at Sanford University, CA are
licensed by the campus police, and
bear both a decal and an identifying
"bug mark" through which they can be
traced back to the University it
recovered elsewhere. Bicycles are a
prime target at Stanlord——as many as
600 vanish each year there.

Several colleges have developed a
student marshal force, while others
have worked out night "escort"
services ‘lor students. The student
marshals, or watchmen as they are
sometimes called, function as the
"eyes and ears” ol campus police
forces. They are also asked to provide
auxiliary assistance at special events.
The elaborate student marshal system
at Syracuse University in upstate New
York, for instance, is credited with
holding down its crime rate.

Undergrad Law Degree

City College of New York (CCNY)
and New York Law School (NYLS)
have completed plans for the nation's
lirst undergraduate degree in law.

The program, which will combine
legal training with traditional
undergraduate studies, will take six
years to complete, one less than usual
for a law degree. Students in the
program at CCNY will be permitted to
enroll at the NYLS at the end of their
junior year.

The new Urban Legal Studies
Program will concentrate on
consumer law, landlord—tenant
relations, small business enterprises,
geriatric and medical law, criminal
justice and civil liberties.
