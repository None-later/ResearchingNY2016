e are all familiar with the

sometimes nauseating

architecture of SUNYA. The
outside of the Power Plant maintains
the same quality of white concrete that
encompasses the rest of this campus.
But the interior is a completely
different story:

The interior of the Power Plant is not
white. It is touched with various shades
of blue, gray, a little yellow, a bit of red,
aaid some black. it is also a very noisy
place. it is ex tremer hard to maintain a
conversation and not the least bit easy
to think there, either. The size of the
place is not overly impressive, but the
machinery it houses is. It is this
machinery that keeps SUNYA alive
and well through both winter and

summer.

Within the main building ol the
Power Plant are three boilers, one of
which is huge, the other two being

   
 

keeps the campus going throughout
the spring, summer, and autumn
months. When winter comes. the
remaining two boilers are put into
operation because of the increased
demand for heat and hot water.
What exactly do these boilers do?
Well, for one thing, they supply all
the heat and temperature regulated
water to the entire uptown campus.
The boilers heat the water in them to
about 400°at the rate of 67S tbs/hr. for
the big one and 400 lbs/hr. for the
smaller ones. This water is then
circulated to the podium and the
quads through the pipeline that can be
found inside the tunnels. There are lour
pumps in the power plant that move
the hot water out. These are rated at
150 horsepower, but they are never all
used at once.

Energy:

temperature of the hot water that is to
be used in the hot water faucets to
about 120”. This water is then sent to
the labs, kitchens, and bathrooms.
The water that is not decreased in
temperature is allowed to cool
somewhat as it runs through the pipes
to the radiators on campus. The heat
here is hot water heat. But it is dry heat
because the hot water is used to heat
the air which is then sent through the
radiator pipes to the classrooms,
dorms, offices, and lecture centers.
The power plant used gas and Oil to
tun tlS boileis. Natural gas is used most
ol the time, due to its being more
ellicientarid much less expens'ive. This
price comparison is meaningless until
you realize that it take566 gallons ol oil
to do the 1(le that 1000 cubic leet of
natural gas will do. The federal
government regulates the amount of
fossil fuels that ihe plant can Lise.

Did you ever walk along the
and sit down on one of
rectangular concrete mushroom-like
bench things that seem to serve no
useful purpose except to blow warm
air onto the back of your legs? Did you
ever wonder what they were and why
they were heating the outside world?

if you were to walk along in the
tunnels, you might find several
