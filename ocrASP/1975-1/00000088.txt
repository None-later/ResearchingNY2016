textbook, properly used, can
be invaluable b you in any
course. Itcan make the course

easier for you; it can add to the

knowledge you gain in the classroom -

as wellas prepare you for classroom
work; it can and should serve as a
permanent resource book for you' after
the course itself has been completed.
The following six steps have proved to
be successful in using textbooks, and
they can easily be applied to any
assignment.

1. Survey the entire book

2. Read for the main ideas

3. Question yourself as you read

4. Underlineand make margin notes

5. Use study guides

6. Review systematically

Before you read your textbook, make.

a brief survey of the author's method
and intention so you understand how
he has ordered his materials.

Read the preface carefully to
acquire a sense of the author's majdr

 

 

 

purpose in writing the' book, his
approach to the materials, and the
structure he is following.

Scan thetable of contents to grasp
the organization and scope of the book.
As you read particular chapters,
review the table of contents to remind
yourself of the larger context the
author has in mind.

Read the concluding chapter or
final paragraphs of the book. The
author will often stress and summarize
those major points that he has
demonstrated specifically in
individual chapters.

Glance at the book as a whole and
at the apparatus that supplements the
text: chapter headings and summaries,
reading suggestions, quizzes,
chronologies, discussion questions,
graphs, pictures and diagrams. In a
short time you will have a sense of the
author's overall techniques which will
help you read the book more
profitably.

Before you read a chapterin the text, ‘

survey the author's main ideas.
Read whatever headnotes or
summaries appear in the chapter.
They provide a clue to all of the main
concepts that the author is stressing,
and they serve as a handy outline.

Examine the headings and sub-
headings ot the chapter to gain a
sense of its main ideas, organization,
and direction. The arrangement of
these headings often will suggest
which topics are primary and which
are subordinate.

PAGE 6?

The author is trying to convey a
central concept in any given chapter
of his book, and you should concern
yourself with that concept rather than
worry excessively about details. By
concentrating on the main idea, you
will find that facts and supporting
evidence are much easier to
remember. Periodically ‘ask yourself
what the author is trying to say in a
particular section of a chapter.

Coordinate your class notes with
your reading. Good lectures or class
discussions should further illuminate
the perceptan you have derived from
your reading. Keep full, legible, and
accurate notes. Like your textbook,
lecture notes will serve as a basic part
of your knowledge in later years, and
you will find yourself returning to them
for guidance.

Read your assignment before the
class discussion. Not only will this
technique make cramming for
examinations unnecessary, but it will
also give you confidence in your own
ideas. If you wait until the professor
and other students discuss an
assignment before you read it, you will
lose faith in yourself as an independent
reader. Read the material regularly
and discuss it in class so that you are
constantly testing your ideas. Your
verbalization of reading material will
reinforce it in your mind.

Summarize whatever you have
read. After finishing a page, restate the
main ideas in your mind and then
glance back to see if you are correct.
Before closing your text, repeat the
major points of the material you have
read. See if you can jot down the
central ideas in the section you have
just completed. If you can, you will find
that most of the supporting details will
return to you rather easily. In addition,
when you resume your reading the
next day, your brief review will serve
as an encouragement to begin the next
assignment. By noting the major points
of your reading, you will find that your
preparation for an examination is a
relatively simple matter.

Mark your text freely and underline
key statements. Bracket key phrases
and put light check marks around
significant points. After you have read
a few paragraphs, return to your
markings and underline the phrases

    

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
 
 

   
  
 

     
  

    

   

 

   

 

  
 

    
  

and sentences that seem most
important to you. Be careful to select
only the main idea. If you underline
judiciously, you will have a clear idea
of the most important material you
have read when you review.

Writing in the margins can also
be helpful. Challenge the author
directly in the margins of the text. Ask
questions, disagree, modify
statements, rephrase concepts in your
own language. By actively engaging
the author's ideas, you will read more

 

alertly and you wrii rerneiiiuei mm.
you have read. -

Note taking .is an individual
matter and each student will have to
decide upon the best technique for
himself; but there is no question that to
make your teaming active and to
retain what you have read, you must
take notes. These notes will be very
useful at a later time, reminding you of
your immediate reaction to specific
passages in the textbook and reviving
information that you have forgotten.

A journal or reading log proves
useful. After you have read a section
or a chapter, record your thoughts so
that you will have a personal and

active encounter with the textbook.
You may want to keep an informal
reading log, jotting down perceptions
or expressing yourself creatively; you
may want to.be more formal and
syncpsize whole chapters in a brief
paragraph. In any event, the
transcription of your thoughts to paper
will be of great help in reviewing and
in writing subsequent essays or term
papers.

At university centersand institutions
throughout the United States, studies
are being conducted at a rapid pace
into various areas of psychic (psi)
phenomena:

1. Dr. Thelma Moss at the
Neuropsychiatric Institute at
U.C.L.A.—-the leading American
expert in the field of parapsychology—
along with her research partner,
Kendall Johnson, have been actively
engaged in photographing what they
firmly believe to be auras of energy
fields surrounding human beings,
plants, and all living organisms.

2. Dr. William Tiller of the Stanford
Research Institute (SR1), entering psi
research from the field of physics, has
exclaimed that mankind is on the
verge of opening up a "new realm of
physics more relevant than anything
that has been discovered since the
days of the Greeks.”

3. Edgar Mitchell, former US.
astronaut, has founded the Institute of
Noetic Sciences devoted to pSi
research after conducting telepathy
experiments and describing his "field
consciousness" experience aboard
Apollo 14.

4.ln hundreds of colleges; and
universities around the country,
students are learning how to control
involuntary bodily functions such (is

techniques.

that researchers in the field are
investigating. Basically, the field has
been divided into four major areas:

Telepathy communication of
thoughts from one person to
another.

Clairvoyance perception of events
and objects not involving any use of
the five senses, i.e. ESP.

Psychokenesis the mental ability to
move and shape objects.

Precognltlon foreknowledge of
events.

The first category focuses on the
princrple of mind over mind, the
second and third on mind over matter,
and the fourth on mind over time.
Operating from within such a broad
and highly controversml framework, it
is no wonder that prirapsychologists
have found itditficult to limit the scope
of their efforts wtheieby increasing the
jilrtuStbtllly of their results, as well as
roducmg the damaging image

associations of psychic researchers to
fraudulent healers and magicians.

actually witnessing, according to the
researchers, is a transfer of energy
from the healer to the injured person.
In another related development, both

Soviet and American
pa rapsychotogists have located
several hundred primary energy

centers which correspond with the
main Chinese acupuncture points.

The tremendous success of
biofeedback experiments—the
process by which one gains the ability
to control involuntary bodily functions
by means of monitoring physiological
data—has given credence to the
claims of transcendental meditators
and Eastern yogis. If one can learn to
control heart beat, blood pressure, and
body temperature with such ease,
parapsychologists are speculating as
to the limits of such mind over matter
techniques.

Already there has been convincing
evidence that migraine headaches
and other such psycho-physical
disorders can be eliminated with the
mental attitude. Moreover,

The most profound trend in
pririij'isychology has been the move
away from psychology and into the
realm of theoretical physics.
Investigations into psi phenomena
have rendered obsolete the rational
preconceptions of 19th century
science. first as the quantum theory
and relativity drastically altered
standard Newtonian physics,
theoretical parapsychology is
attempting to synthesize post-
liinsteinian physics with modern
advances in psychology.

Recent discoveries in the field of
sub-atomic physica have opened

 

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

enormous possibilities for the
parapsychologist. Many physicists
believe that the neutrino—a sub-
atomic particle that possesses no
magnetic field, no charge, no mass,
and which passes through the earth as
it it were not there——may actually
represent a particle from another
universe and time continuum. In '
analogous fashion, it has been
proposed by several leading scientists
that pure mental energy may have its
basis in some as yet undiscovered
“mindstuff” particles or "psychons."

V.A. Firsoft speculates that mind isa
"universal entity or interaction of the
so me order as electricity or
gravitation," composed of particles
that he has labeled "mindons."
Richard Feynman‘s theory that
posrtrons (positive electrons) are
actually electrons travelling backward
in time hosted to new perspectives on
time flow which may have dramatic
consequences for physics as well as
parapsychology. Andrian Dobbes, a
microphysicist, has suggested the
existence of "psitrons"—particles that
travel in another time dimension and
which react With no urons in the human
brain.

Thus modern physicists are
depicting a universe in which mind
and matter are related in ways never
before imagined. Also, time distortion
ill the subatomic level might explain
the psychic phenomenon of
piecognition. Dr. Helmut Schmidt
asserts that "psi energy exists and can
be tested in accordance to certain sub-
atomic principles."

Where is all this leading to? No one
:an be certain. But the general
consensus among psi researchers is
that man is on the verge of shattering
the basiic foundations of rriodern
scrence and is expanding his horizons
into n new frontier more incredible and
more fantastic than anything he has
ever dared todream of, In the words of
scientist-author Arthur Koestler,
modern SClt-thllStS are "Peeping Toms
til the keyhole of eternity."

When lid Mitchell was orbiting the
moon aboard Apollo 14, he
experienced what lit: later termed a
“hold connoioutint-iris" feelingﬂa
Utipltnrlu sensation, tl realization that
flltill was not living up to his full
potential, that the human mind
contained vast "untapped potential.”
Through the use of this newly-founded
mental technology, ltlrttl Will have the
capability and capacity to solve the
grave problems confronting him on
earth, to satisfy his innate intellectual
desires, and to enhance an
appreciation for his place in the

cosmos, thereby enriching the
universal spiritual dimension of his
existence. As physicist-philosopher Sir
James lean observed several decades
ago, “the universe begins to look more
and more like a great thought”~—a
thought that man may be on the
threshold of understanding.
