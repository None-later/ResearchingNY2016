Last winter. hundreds of students at the State

University crammed into a somber campus

center ballroom to witness the only known

pictorial record of the moment President John
F. Kennedy was shot. The audience sat at the
edges of their chairs. watching the ﬁlm of
President Kennedy slumping forward in the
a back seat of a convertible, his hands moving
toWard his neck. Suddenly, the President‘s
head is violently snapped backward. as the
upper part of his body is jolted from the seat.
Blood explodes from his face and skull
fragments scatter in the air. The audience
gasped with shock. Faint traces of sobbing
could,be heard. ‘ ‘
This so-called “Zapruder ﬁlm“,(an amateur

movie taken bya Dallasdress maker) has been.

presented on campuses nationwide by
lecturing conspiracy theory researchers. It is
one of the pieces of .. “ . among
many. refuting the Warren Commission
ﬁndings that the President was shot from the
rear by a lone demented assassin - Lee Harvey
Oswald. The movie clip was shown two weeks
ago at Boston University. where a group of
researchers from across the country met to
discuss the credibility of the Warren
Commission report. and especially to plan a

national political movement to reopen ofﬁcial“

Their timing couldnft have been better. The

political climate in America. People have
grown skeptical about the covert role that
government has played abroad and at home.

Another report explained how the F.B.l. had
secretly gathered and publicly distributed
information on the sex activities of the Warren

disclosures that these agencies have lost much
of the public‘s respect.

But how does all this relate to the
assassination of President Kennedy? The.
Warren Commission had established its

Zapruder ﬁlm. and other material evidence
collected by the researchers can prove that the
Commission was little more than a
sophisticated cover-up of the facts. What
discredits the report even more is the fact that
the actual investigations of the assassination
were not carried out by the members of the
Commission. This responsibility was given by

'the Commission to the C.I.A.. the F. 8.1.. the

Secret Service. the State Department. and
several military intelligence agencies. The
same organizations that are under such
intense scrutiny today provided the
investigative information. pieces of evidence
and witnesses for the report that was
published by the Warren Commission. How
much confidence. therefore. can we have in’its
ﬁndings?

.. ‘1 According to. the Gallup Poll, 78% of the
.‘ American people don't believe the Warren
' Commission. It seems that the Commission‘s

report has raised more questions that it has
answered. Why wasn‘t one word recorded by
the Dallas police department during their |2
hour interrogation of Lee Harvey Oswald?
Why have all the signiﬁcant medical
photographs taken during the operation and
autopsy of John Kennedy been exposed but
never developed; and why were they placed in
the unconditional custody of the Secret
Service? Within the three years following the
assassination. why had l8 material witnesses
died - sixteen. of unnatural and bizarre causes?
These are a few among the countless mysteries
that have blemished the Warren Commission
investigation.

The answers to these questions lie in the
researchers‘ evidence - not new evidence. but
old evidence that has been witheld from the
public since November 22. I963. The people of
America want tntth. Only the members of
Congress and thc SEnatc can render it by
reopening the investigation and clearing the
air of suspicion Such a proceding may reveal
another dimension of power that the
governmental “intrastructures” possess and
wield. The reputation of many Washington
notables would be jeopardized. It would be an
added burden on the conscience of the
President - Gerald Ford is among the
surviving members of the Warren
Commission. These consequences are
insignificant when_ compared, to the greater
truths that would be procured. The need to
know is evident. For the sake of our national
conscience and the honor of our government.
Congress must satisfy tltis‘nccd - now. more
than ever.

I Masculine nudity was an accepted

' tenure ‘of one: m from the

Archaic Ageon. probably under the
influence of athletics. By contrast.
feminine nudity does not appear un-
til the ﬁfth century B.C. and even
then is typically encountered in vase
painting and small~scale sculpture
rather than in large-scale sculpture.
When Praxiteles at Knidos about
350 B.C. created a completely un-
draped statue of Aphrodite he
shocked many of his contem-
poraries. Onlyin the Hellenistic Age,
under the aegis of Aphrodite.did the

the Crouching Aphrodite type,
which was first developed by the
sculptor Doidalsas of thethird cen-
tury B.C. and of which there are ex-
amples both in Rome and in New
York City. Here Aphrodite is
crouching down while arranging her
long hair. Her legs. torso. and head
are all turned in different directions.
thus inviting the viewer to move
around her and to View her from
different angles. She is lifelike. soft.
warm. and sensuous. One wonders if
the unknown artist. like the mythical

ly successful the shifting technique is
in rpcsenting contrasting situations.
This ﬁlm technique is also successful
in showing similarities as it dies with
a Protestant and Catholic family ex-
pressing their views from similar
homcsand family situations. The use
ofbuckground commentary also has
powerful impact in a similar way.

The film gives all sides their
chance to speak and in the case of
Northern Ireland. as in most
situations of reality. there is no black
and white. no clear-cut good and
bad. The sides are many and the
situation complex. Under the ob-
vious Protestant - Catholic conflict
there is a social and cconomicas well
as political conflict. Alter being
given all sides the viewer cannot help
sympathixing. to some extent. with

time. empathize with the oppressed

Fiery Encore

(ZNS) Sangthong Sisui. a

one way to deal with a rowdy
audience.

It all began when Sisai arrived two
hours late for a scheduled concert
last week. He tried tocxplain that his
lateness was caused by a car acci-
dent. but the audience wouldn‘t
listen. Instead. they began peppcring
the stage with debris and bottles.
when one container struck Sisal in
the head.

The folksinger suddenly pulled
out a pistol and ﬁred away at ran-
dom back into the audience. Three
people were wounded —and the
folksinger V was later jailed on
attempted murder charges.
