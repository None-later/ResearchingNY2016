Pups Keep on Rolling

by Mike Plekarski

Next victim! Maybe it jus seems
that the way the Albunyjunidrvarsi-
ty basketball team has been playing
recently - with their 35-49 victory
over Hanwick on Friday night and
their fill-69 rl‘r’umph ovcr Adiron-
dack C.C. the following night - that
anyone who playsthem at University
Gym is akin to a sacrificial lamb.

The two wins leave Bob Lewis‘
Pups with a 12-3 slate on the season
and a final o-l mark at home.

The llartwick contest was not
really a solid test for the lacals. liut
the first half was fairly evenly played
up until the last few minutes. Dave
Thomson. starting center in place of
Verdejo. opened the scoring with a
short jumper off an. offensive
rebound. just before it Steve ’ass
steal and driving layup.

But two foul shots and a ten foot
jumper by Hartwick's John Tobin
knotted the score at 6-6 a few
minutes later. Both ballclubs were
playing tenacioust on defenserrnd it
was tough to get a good shot off by
either tern. After the visitors‘took a
7-6 iertd at I4252. the lead changed
hands no less than eight times.
before Aubrey Brown took a nifty
pass from Amos 'l‘aylorant‘l snared a
layup and a succeeding free throw to
complete a big three point plrry fora
l7-l5 Pup advantage midway
through the half.

Asit turned out. that waste hr the
last time'tlre lead would change
hands the rest of the way! David
Claire snared a few Warrior buckets
[but they were offset when the Pups‘
ltob Luciano had the hot lutnd,con~
necting on a couple of 20-foot
swtthcs. With

the score 27-23,

Albany. the Pups came up with
seven in a row. partly due to tire
successful use of their zone at this
point. Gary Lull ended the skein
with a ten footer to cut it to 34—25
with a little over three minutes to
play. but that was the last gasp for
the Warriors.

" Thomson came right brick and
snared rt layup and the Pups were on
their way. A Verdejo layup. two Pass
drives and some minutes later the
Pups found themselves ahead 48-25
at the half; with I4 consecutive
points to close it out! From there. it
was just a matter of playing or t the
required 20 minutes of the second
half in accordance with college rules.

The Pups outscored the Warriors
in the second half 37 to 24. bttt it
didn't make much of a difference.
Claire ended up as the game's high
scorer with 18. while lirowu with l5
ttnd Pass with l4 paced Albany. llut
of greater importance to Coach
Lewis was the emergence of
Luciano. The 5‘7" guard played a
fine all-around game rtnd really took
charge of the offense when
necessary. in addition to picking up
some key buckets.

Tltc Adirondack affair was just a
bit trickier. Althotrgh Albany led
most of the game and by as rnttch as
25. the visitors never conceded rtnd
gave the Pups a little something to
sweat about. down the stretch. as
they seemed to gctcloserttnd closer.

Ed Mchrmott hit first on n layup
for a 24) Adirondack lead. before the
Pups snared the next eight on four
Thomson points plus a l’rtss jumper
and a Ray (lay steal and driving
score. The early pressure applied by
the locals wasgiving Adirondack lits

 

as they committed quite a fcw tur-
novers.

Lewis had everybody in the game
and everybody was contributing.
Thomson did quite a job trnder the
boards and also led Albany irt half-
time points with eight. ArnosTaylor
and Luciano took turns running the
offense and both performed ad-
mirably as they hit the open man
time and time again. The Pttps were
rtrnning very well. while rrt the same
tintc. clogging up tltc visitors‘ mid-
dle. forcing them to take the low
percentage outside shot.

Adirondack took up rrtuclt of the
clock in their offensive
munctrvcrings. but were lutving their
troubles getting on the boartl. trail-
ing 43-22 at intermission. 'l'hc Pups
shot a fine lit/.15 in the half for5|%
while Adirondack could snug only
a, 2n for 37%.

Till: l'trps shot slightly worse in the
second half as A.C.C. kept coming
back. McDermott uud lirian .Iones
were hot anti finally brought their
team to within hailing range aloft-57
with 4tl‘) left. lint (lrcg Johnson hit
a couple of jumpers. while lirown
was penetrating quite often for all
kinds of Iayttps and chipshots. That
proved to be the difference down the
stretch.

lirown and Johnson led the Pups
with l4 apiece. while Mchrmott
with 20 and Jones with l7 were the
Adirondack leaders. Thomson
played a litre game and tallied l2.
while (lay was the unsung hero. with
a superb seven assists and tltrec
steals on the night for the winners.

The Pups close out their season
with fottr road games. beginning

Thursday at R.l’.l. in a 7:30 ripoff,

 

r

t

contest with Buffalo State the
following Tuesday. Only Albanycan
overtake Brockport, because Albany
has already beaten Geneseo. and a
two way tie goes to thewinner of the
game between the teams involved.
Buffalo State is ineligible for the bid
because they have gone Div. ll . but
they can play spoilers. Oneonta was
eliminated ina Friday loss to Buffalo
State.
Brockport earlier last week. for their
third loss.

Should Albany beat Brockport.
bttt Buffalo State fail as spoilers, the
Danes might receive an at large bid.
but the NCAA generally frowns
upon bringing two SUNY schools

, into the toumamcnt. An ECAC bid
is probable. with the tournament
probably at Union College.

The season appeared to be over
thanks to Potsdam Friday. as
Albany left the court trailing40-29 at
the half. The Danes had fallen

game. closed it to l4—l3witlr l32091o

“We changed ourway of attacking

Albany varsity coach Doctor
Richard Saucrs, “and that was the
difference. Once we started

they could not keep up with us."

Oswego came to Albany with u l-
13 record. and the outcome of that
one was never in doubt. as Albany

minutes. and led 37-18 at the half.
Mike Suprunowicz scored 10 of his

SA Reacts

SA‘s Central Council voted
Wednesday night to censure and
remove from the FSA membership
board FSA Director Howie
Grossman. Lew Barr. and Jeff Sher-
man. The exact effect of the resolu-
tion is not clear but the ultimate
question of seting its members is up
to the other FSA Directors.

The membership board is ap-
proved by Council and in turn elects
the student FSA Directors.

Council members complained
that the student Directors were not
looking to save money for the
students. they were incompetent
because they did not properly
research the issue. they did not in-
lllillt.‘ ideas. they did not fight the
hike. and that those who voted
against the 7'/:‘% were not acting in
the best sttrdcrtt interests.

Snitl (it‘osstttttn later. “in their
(Council‘s) utrnds there are still
mysterious place to cut.“

The action rcl'lcctcd the iutcnt of
Council ill passing in an emergency
session Sunday night a bill calling
for the r etnotrtlol'any student Direc-
tor who totcd for a board increase.
SA l’rcstdcnt Pat Curran \ctoed the
bill. llrc \otc against Barr and
(irossman uas itt response to their
votes against a7‘/2'.'ir hike. (Sherman
voted in favor).

Council tncrnber Rick Mccklcr
(l )utclt) said that the members didn't
do enough rcscarclt. l'le poittted out
that when the subject of l’atroon
Room prices came up at the FSA
lioard meeting. Vice-President of
Mangctncnt and Planning. .lohn
llart ley (art administration tncrnber)
said “they‘re too high already“ and
no student member said a word.

Maurccn DcMaio flrtdian)
wondered at the Council meeting if
the members had done any research
either. “i have serious doubts." she
said. in reference to the hike. "about
how much research anyone on this
Cotrncil did into this matter.“
Mccklcr checked yesterday and
found significantly higher prices at
Howard Johnson‘s arid Lerner‘s
Sandwich Shop.
