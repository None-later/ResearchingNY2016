In an effort to inform students of I

their potential power ininﬂuencing
state legislators'. actions, the Albany
chapter of NYPIRG set up a table in
the Campus Center lobby this past
Wednesday and Thursday.

The New York Public Interest
Research Group, organized and
funded by students in college cam-
puses throughout New York State,
deals with such issues as pollution,
job discrimination, government
responsiveness and consumer
protection. NYPIRG members_
research the problems, raises public
support, draft proposals and form
lobbies to achieve their goals, aogore
ding to a pamphlet distributed by
NYPIRG.

The table was set up as a
“widespread campaign to dis-
seminate information on
legislators,“ said Arthur Malkin.
chairperson ofthe Albany chapterof
NYPIRG. The idea is to let students
know who their legislators are, and
how they voted on issues. Becoming
more aware and involved, they will
write letters to their legislators and
thereby affect his actions, headdcd.

It‘s up to the students as con-
stituents to have art input into what
his or her legislators do," noted
Malkin. Malkin feels that the
legislators are concerned with what
constituents want but they do not
receive enough feedback from thcnr.

According to Malkin. "Students
basically have social concerns and

(ZNS) Police departments Amuse T
the United Stateswill soon be able to
purchase the'latest in crowd control
weaponry—a bizarre new device
called “the laser."

The Christian Science Monitor
reports that the laser is a nine-inch-
long ﬂashlight which fires twin oneé
inch darts designed for crowd con-
trol, the laser reportedly can in-
capdcitate the leader of an unlawful
demonstration without inflicting
any permanent physical harm.

The Monitor says that the device.
designed by a California aerospace
firm, ﬁres the harpoon-like darts up
to Is feet, with each dart trailing a
fine wire.

The developers claim that the

to quickly incapacitate a subject'or.
after a few seconds. to produce un-
consciousness. The Monitor says
that the taser isjustoneof many new
Buck Rogers-like weapons soon to
be added to the “non-lethal“ arsenals
of domestic police forces.

(ZNS) A House subcommittee is
seriously studying the possibility of
requiring national identification to
be carried by every American citizen.

The issue of ID. cards was raised
before the House Immigration Sub-
committee this week by Acting U.S.
Attorney General. Laurence Silbcr—
man. The subcommittee has been
hearing testimony about the
problem caused by illegal aliens
entering the United States.

Silhcnnan and several other
witnesses testiﬁed that there is no
way that employers can tell whether
a new employee is a US. citizen or
an illegal alien. He suggested that
special Ll). cardsbc issued toall Un-
ited States‘ citizens as proof of
citizenship.

darts hook themselves in the intend-
ed target's clothing rather than
penetrating his or her skin. Once the
laser darts make contact, police then
administer very brief but shocking
50.000 volt pulses through the wires.

Several members of the subcom-
mittee objected to 'the LD. proposal,
claiming that universal ID. cards
are a threat to civil liberties and are

reminiscent of a police state.

However, Under-Secretary, of
Labor. Richard Schubert, disagreed.
Schubert stated that “the problem
(of illegal oliurs)is serious enough to
warrant extraordinary measures.“

Witnesses in favor of the ID. card
said that the proposal could beeasily
attached to a bill introduced recently
on illegal aliens by Congressman
Peter Rodino of New Jersey.

(ZNS) Political activist comedian
Dick Gregory has called on the
“Rockefeller Commission" to in-
vestigate C.I.A. involvement in the

Zapruder film. a home tnovic filmed

tion concluded itr l964that all shots
were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald.
