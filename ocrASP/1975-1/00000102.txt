by Pat Current

The 8% FSA board hike is probably hitting
most quad residents like a [lump bf FSA‘s
starchy scalloped pototoes—with a dull thud.

. It‘s’ a common phenomenon. One grows
accustomed to it before long.

The telephone company announces it‘s
_asking the Public Service Commission for a
rate increase: “Thad!” the governor says he
wants a lo: per gallon gas tax: “Thudl” Closer
to home. the state‘s recommendedbudget cuts
‘ SUNYA's personnel and» Iibmry funds:

‘ “Thudl” The city of Albany outlaws groups of
four or more students living in an apartment:

= “Thad!” The Chancellor wants a $50
dormitory room rent increase: “Thud!”

'It can be painful; it soon becomes numbing.
“What can Ido about it?) people sometimes
ask themselves. And sometimes the only
alternative seems to be getting “involved.”

An involved individual gets to see close up
why things are the way they are. However. she
or he likewise will see why things are going to
remain justasthey are-Operation: Dull Thud.

A good example is the case of the FSA
board bike. which was passed this week. Now.
the majority of students will sit in the dining
hall and crab about the lima beans or argue
with each otﬁsr over whose roast beef is
tougher. They’ligroan all the way back to their
rooms about having to pay even more money
for food like that. “They can't do thisto us!"

Consider that proclamation: "ﬂier" can't
do this to us.“ Who is “they?” Do “they” exist.
and where? Why don‘t we and "they" simply
sitdown some dayand hash things out'r‘They”
are always up to something. the dirty so-and-
so‘s.

When talking about FSA. "they" are the
members of the Board of Directors. along with
the general manager and officers of the
corporation.'l'hey"includc. by the way. some
of us.

Although board increases occur at this
school with greater regularity than even Ex-
Lax could promise. they are not automatic—-
not exactly. Boards of Directorsare supposed
to ensure that that doesn't happen. Boards of
Directors. variously known as committees.
councils. or more popularly. task forces. bring
them and us together face to face.

The problem is. it may be difficult to
distinguish after a while between them and us.
In fact. we hecumcthem. This would not be an
unhappy occurrenw. and many believe it
should be strived for. that is. becoming them.
W e should not draw the line between us. they
say (and usually it is “they” who make this
point). We should “communicate” and trust
one another. We should minimize dissonance
and maximize harmony (only they could talk
like that).

This situation is unfortunate. however.

i one who will speak for or. for

(we have“: ed to them and‘become them.

We' have‘thuddcred at the thought of conflict.

' even verbal debate. We have tried to be like

them. and, hope'to be liked by them. It is
important. this liking. -

Thus. we'must not question. If we question.
we must not argue. for if we argue we increase

' discord. hinder good communication, and

most seriously. we no longer seem to trust-

' them. They

n in a pointed in us. I

MeanWhile. net at 5the tints seam.

someone is still asking. “How thelhellean they
raise board 8%‘an‘d still feed usthis same . . .“
But the question does not reach the ears of

the members of the Board‘: they’ who confuse I

communication and capitulation. dissonance

and dissent. mistrust and healthy debate. It‘s

too simple. ’ »

by Grace Jordan

On January I. I970. former President
Nixon signed’ into law the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and
declared that. “the I970‘s absolutely must be
the years when America pays its debt to the
past by reclaiming the purity of its air. its
waters and our living environment. It is
literally now or never.”

The National Environmental Policy Act
can probably. at best. be regarded as your run-
of—thc-mill Joe Policy. Overworded and
vague. it is an excellent example of that
inevitable political trademark: use the greatest
amount of words to say as little as possible.
The bill itselfmakes no precise commitments.
instead it simply reiterates what has been said
a thousand times before.

Anyway. in conjunction with the
publication of this inane bill. the National
Environmental Protection Agency also
established a Council on Environmental
Quality. The CEO is supposed to study and
develop environmental programs. coordinate
Federal efforts in that direction and assist the
President in making environmental decisions.
An inspection of the Council's
accomplishments since its creation is less than

. encouraging.

About the only dcccnt thing that came out
of all these nicetics. was the idea of
Environmental Impact Statements. An
Environmental Impact Statement may consist
ofa few pages or a few hundred. and assesses
in detail the potential environmental
implications ofa proposed action. All Federal
agencies are required to prepare statements
for matters under their jurisdiction.

the Word

 

Essentially. each statement must include
information and techniwl data and a
discussion of the projects‘ impact on
ecological systems. Statements must also
mention unavoidable adverse environmental
effects and in analysis of the cumulative. long—
term results.

To me. the beauty of the impact statement
procedure is that itallows the publica limited
opportunity to participate in Federal
decisions. Draft statements must be made
public not less than ninety days before
commencement of the proposed action.
Interested people may disagree in writing with
any statement and many agencies provide for
public hearings. To date. half of all
environmental impact statements have been
concerned with roadbuilding and the
implementation of landsatping and bike
trails.

The fact that courts have upheld the right of
citizens to sue on environmental grounds is a
sign that at least somebody is listening. Talk
about the potential power of John Doe!

People working to help the environment is
the key to overcoming all the dirty air and
garbage and dead fish and maimed birds and
oil-covered beaches and filthy water. . 

Get involved. Join the ‘I’rotcct Your
Environment‘ group here at SUNYA. Or
better yet. get off campus and work with the
Environmental Planning Lobby of Albany
(l09 State Street. l2207). Write your legislator
and tell him how you feel. Write to the
Environmental Protection Agency
(Washington. DC. 20460) for information or
to voice your opinion. This is your
degenerating world. Do something about it.

A phone call. A simple,
ten-cent phone call for a cab
could save your friend’s life.

- .If your friend has been
drinking too much. he shouldn’t
be driving.

The automobile crash is
the number one cause of death
of people your age. And the
ironic thing is that the drunk
drivers responsible for killing
young people are most often
other young people.

Take a minute. Spend a
dime. Call a cab. That’s all. If
you can’t do that, drive him
yourself. Or let him sleep on
your couch.

be a_doctor or a cop.]ust a friend.
