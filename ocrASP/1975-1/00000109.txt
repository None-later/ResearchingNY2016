  students and FSA:

On this campus the Student Association has attpted toaet forcefully in an effort
to protect students from increased costs that seem to be attacking in every direction.
Board rates have just been upped eight per cent. Check-Cashing fees will go to twenty-
ﬁve cents per check this summer. a room hike is in the works. food costs in vending
machines and in the Campus Center eateries are increasing. and costs like traveling and
supplies haven't stopped going up in years. The new Albany housing ordinance could
empty student wallets also.

It‘s a frustrating position SA ﬁnds itself in. and it is impossible for them to ignore
these developments and still feel they are representing the students. Their efforts have
been essential in making it clear to the administration and FSA that the tandem voice
must be heard on each and every issue that effects them and that SA must be reckoned
with. _

0n the other hand. some SA moves have been overreactions.

The withdrawal of the FSA loan. 180.000dollars worth. was ofno real consequence.
lt's major efTect will be ﬁfteen thousand fetter dollars in the coffers ofSA. The interest
rate that FSA paid SA was 85': per cent. a half a per cent lower than u hat FSA would
get from a bank. This figure ﬂuctuated with the prime rate. but regardlessofthe outside
market it was a good deal for FSA because the) alwa} s nould save one-half percent.
For SA. it was also an excellent deal because the present Certiﬁcate olDeposit rate is
slighlt) ahm e 68: per cent. In ellct’t. h_\‘ cooperating the in o L‘ni\ersit_\' organizations
\\ ere saving money by heating the hanks out oi their cut. Regardless (if the changing
banking lituation. SA “ill not be able to get ahigher interest rate on their mone} than
the rate PSA “ould gitc them wtthout going into high-risk securities or bonds.

FSA Director L \orhert Zahm was disappointed. but not upset It hurts FSA is
little. but in some \tays takes aua) a ke} weapon that could be used to inﬂuence FSA
policy and thus is ti relic-l to Zahm. It hurts SA‘s image a little. because the act isoneol
emotion and not ol reason. It is "punishing" l-SA for not keeping Pl’lCr.‘ increasesdmx’ri.
especially board rates. and [or continuing to sustain operations like the barbershop
and the Patroon room that continue to lose mone}. But the MAC oi the u eapon is not in
keeping with the si/e of the problem.

The Wall

ln what is de\ elopingas the battle of nerves between the Student Association and the
Faculty Student Association. the two ma} ha\e inad\ertentl_\ stumbled across ll’tctmt‘
impasse that “ill cast the entire confrontation in the proper perspectne. in Central
Council‘s action to demand that FSA pay in full for the cost oi constructinga partition
in an ellort to gain a new appearance lot the Rathskellar. \w hatt- been presented \iith
the classic example of retaliation taken to its irrational conclusion.

Students ha\e been asked to pay somcS-‘lﬂOOlor the cost of tin partition itself. u‘mle
l-SA \tould pa) for the renovation and improt ements to add charm to the no“ lileless
student hangout. Council has in effect said that they have taken the hoard increase as a
personal insult and the latest action is to demonstrate that _\ou simpl} don't mess
around with Council.

The Wall in the Rathskellar has taken on dimensions lat greater than an} one either
lrom SA or FSA had imagined. The Wall has no“ become the stmhol of the conﬂict
“hich the board hike has created. and its s_\ mbolic qualitt ma) be far more important
than its material importance. What has unfortunate-l) been lost in this test oi mils is
that both the multi—million dollar corporationand the-elected olticcrs ol the Student
:‘tssouation sene lor the beneﬁt oi the students. lf the Wall ts not built. SA might
proudl} point to the space and say that they stared down the HA giant. \A'l’llit‘ the
Directors in the Commissar) can potnt across Perimeter Road and ma} that the}
refused to knuckle under to the upstart net-behind-the—ears students. but in tact both
still hate failed in the only dut_\ for which they erhl.

When: is the Wall. in the Rathskcllar'.’ Between SA and FSA" ()i final!) has thc wall
been placed between the students and the services the) haw paid lot and descte‘.’
