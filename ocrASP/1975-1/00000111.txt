n these days ol cultism,

l spiritual answers to the

world's problems are
commonplace. Enter the new answer:
a movement which simply teaches its
practitioners to relax. It’s called
Transcendental Meditation (TM).

For twenty minutes twice a day,
practitioners sit quietly, silently
repeating a personal mantra at less
than live syllables as they relax their
bodies and nervous systems and enter
a totally dillerent consciousness.

TM is practiced by an estimated hall
million Americans, who have learned
it through two organizations
established by lounder Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi. The Students
international Meditation Society
(SIMS) is charged with bringing the
experience to college campuses, while
the lntemational Meditation Society
thS) concentrates on working adults
and their lamilies.

Sle' has had particular success in
popularizing TM. A majority ol its users
are students, olteri attracted by huge
centertold ads in college newspapers.
Others attend one 01 the 30 colleges
and universities that have made TM
part oi their curriculum

The lrarriework lorTM is the Science
or Creative lntelligence (SCI), the basic
philosophy ot the Maharishi, who
believes that there IS an “inexhaustible
and tundarnerital source ol
intelligence, energy and happiness" in
every human. One ol the main
lunctions ot TM is to put the
practitioner in close contact with this
source.

TM improves "orderly thinking, skill
in action, creative progress and
satislaction," according to the
Maharishi, and as such isa "technique
tor progressive relinement ol the
nervous system” and a "procedure lor
contacting the lield ot creative
intelligence."

Learning How

Training in TM is simple but
expensive

lnstruction takes place in seven
steps. The tirst three are at no charge:
an introductory lecture, lollowed by a
preparatory talk and a private
interview with a teacher. Butalter that,
the dollars start adding up. For one
private session with a teacher and
three meetings on three consecutive
days lollowing the private session,
initiates pay $45 it they are students,
$75 it they are working adults and
$125 lor lamilies.

Teachers keep hall ol this lee lor
their services, pointing out that
teaching TM is usually their only
livelihood and that to become a
teacher they attended the Maharishi's
villa in Switzerland lor personal
instruction which costs at least $1000
plus travel expenses.

tn the private sessron a student
receives his mantra A-a word drawn
lrom the Vadic Hindu holy books-«and
b‘asic instruction in meditation. The
three sessions alterward are mainly to
check the student's progress. Alter that
the meditator is on his own but is
entitled to tree monthly checkups.

Learning What It Is

TM "is merely an exercise, not a

philosophy . . .We don't teach people

trow to act; we don't teach a style ol
thinking. . .'l'Mis notareligionorcult
and does not demand that a person
change his lilestyle, . , ll you have a
religion,TM will help you understand it
better," its teachers have insisted.

But while TM may be an exercise,
861 has its roots in Vadic Hinduism.
Practitioners however have claimed
that Vadic principles are "older than
any religion," and therelore aren't
religious in nature.

According to the Maharishi, TM has
been practiced by lndian people lor
over6,000years,butwasonly recently
introduced to other countries. ln 1955
the Maharishi gave up larming to
teach TM in lndra, and in 1959 he
decided, like rrrany gurus belore and
Since, that the time was ripe to come to
the US.

The Maharishi's lame spread when
the Beatles, the Beach Boys and a host
ol other luminaries llocked to his teet
inthe 1960's. Young Americans
emulated their rock heroes, and many
ol them lound TM to be a stabilizing,
caln‘iing intluence.

The value ot TM spread by word ol
mouth, and eventually, once TM had a
timi loothold in the US, the Maharishi
launched h is world plan to createa TM
teaching center torevery 1,000 people
alive onear‘ll'r.

Since then, more than 200 centers
have been established in the US alone,
and an estimated 10,000 people
discover TM each month/Through the

Casting Aspersions

There are ot course, some people
who don't picture TM as a cureall.

'"lt's a waste ol time," lohn Lennon
This said, and there are other TM
dropouts who lound it rust wasn't lor
them.

‘thn l rnedrtated I watched the
little star's one sees wrth eyes closed.

You get sort ot apathetic," observed
another. "You don't biirld up any
lHltStOli and you don't get excited
about anything." She said she quit
because she tell she was getting too
dependent on TM.

Psychologist Gary Schwartz ol
Harvard Unrversrty lound in a study he
conducted that TM practitioners didn't
tare as well as norrusers on tests ot
creative problem solving, although
they were better at adlib storytelling
Schwartz said that TM may spaWn
creative inspirations, but it does not
encourage the excitement and
sequential thinking that the expression
ol such ideas requires

Dr. Leon Otis ol Stanlord Research
institute in Calitornra concluded that
iust srtting quietly tor 40 minutes each
day worked as well asTM in reducing
anxrety in subjects he studied. He
concluded both methods worked well
tor tairty stable persons with sorrre
anxiety because the techniques
allowed them to “desensitize
themselves, at their own speed, to
certain personal problems."

But he warned that "an extremely
anxrous person" may liberate nothing
but probteins lrom his mind through
meditation, and noted that TM
dropouts tend to be persons who are
either too well adiusted or who have
problems too severe to respond to a
technique as "mild as TM.

Other critics have been concerned
about SCl's roots in Vadric princtples,
and the prospect that lederal grants
and government encouragement
amount to state support ot a religion.

‘ Mahrishi's theories are pure Hindu
theology and philosophy . . . (mind»
transcending thought, karma, and
experience to arrive at "pure being").
this religious theory 01 TM is evidently
played down . . . but vestiges at it
remain in the teaching process,"
(fltllllletl an article in The Humanist.
Hindu theology and ritual will have to
remain oil the school grounds,” it
concluded

in Newton, N l, a controversy erupted
when local church leaders opposed a
proposed TM course in the local high
school on the ground that the course
amounted to teaching Hinduism in the
public schools.

'l'M practitioners, ol course, have
denied that TM is a religion at all.

Joining the Mainstream

Despite the dissidents, TM has been
touted as the answer to drug abuse and
neurosrs, a method ol prison relorrn,
and the possible answer to a host ot
other problems.

The state legislatures ot Connecticut
and llltnois have passed resolutions
praising TM and asking their state
governments to cooperate in
spreading the Word,

The National lnstitute ol Mental
Health has provrded several leder‘al
research grants to persons studying
the implications and applications ol
'l'M. A number ol high schools have
added SCl and TM to their curricula,
and the lMS is in great demand to
appear lDtrlor'e corporate, crvrc and
other “establishment” groups.

With sut‘lr diverse support the ﬁnal
impact oi TM on US socrety may only
have begun to be tell.
