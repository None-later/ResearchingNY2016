tew years ago, ‘ DDT was
publicized as being not only a
‘ killer ol insects, but at tish,
birds and other animals all the way up
the tood chain. It was consequently
banned by the Environmental
Protection Agency, andthat seemed to

be the last we heard about it.

IoniMitchell wrote such lyrics as,
“Hey farmer Turner, put away your
DDT now." Well, DDT may have been
put away in this country, much to the
chagrin ot manutacturers ot this
substance, but our toreign triends are
yet to learn oi the ettects ot the
dangerous pesticide they are still

importing trom us.

This is not to say that we are no
longer using pesticides ourselves.
Until late this year, stronger and more
lethal insecticides, such as aldrin and
dieldrin replaced DDT, until it was
discovered that these too were
dangerous to “non-target" organisms.
including man.

Bearing this in mind, it may be
ditticult to understand why the

Department ot Agriculture and
chemical companies persist in
searching tor stronger chemicals,

when others are either banned or
become inetteciive.

During World War 11, pesticides,
such as DDT, were tirst thought to be
"savers oi mankind", as a means oi

combating typhus and other insect-
related diseases. Today, it is used by

‘man in his manipulation ot nature to

increase tood production by
protecting specialized crops trom
specitic insect populations. This well-
meant ettort to solve the tood problem
has actually backfired to create more
serious problems ot survival.

The Green Revolution created new
means ot supplying tood tor the
starving, but inadvertently caused an
imbalance in nature and an endless
dependence on pesticides. Single-
simplitied the

crop tarming has
ecosystem and lett single crops
detenseless trom their natural

enemies, and unprotected by nature's
built in checks, thus, the need for
pesticides. However, there will always
be a need tor stronger pesticides. as
the iiitesi insects become immune to_
the pestictdes being used.

What has been ignored until
recently is that the more lethal these
insecticides become to the intended
victim, the more lethal they are to the
rest oi natures.

The long-range ettects oi DDT
resrdues are iirst becoming visibleand
have been linked with the poisoning oi
iish and wildlite populations, as well as
being termed a "carcinogenic"
(cancer-causing agent) threat to
mankind. The problem does not end
with the mere banning ot DDT, as DDT
residues have been tounct in nearly
everything we eat, It is known to build
up iii the tatty tissue oi animals and
man.

DDT, as well as aldrin and dieldrin (a
chlorinated hydrocarbon termed as
aldrin breaks down, residues are also
iound in the airwe breath, thewater we
drink, and the truits and vegetables we
eat. According to a 1973 sampling by
the Food and Drug Administration,
dieldrin has been tourid in 96% ot
meat, tish and poultryThe EPA reports
that 99.5% oi the population have
dieldrin residues in their body tat, with
an average ot 0.3 parts per million.

What has government done to stop
the apparent misuse ot chemical
agents on the environment?

in 1971, EPA proposed the Federal

Environmental Pesticides Control Act, .

which placed restriction on the
"general use" ot pesticides and set
labeling and packaging standards by
the Federal government. It also stated
the "the National Academy ot
Sciences can be called upon by the
EPA tor opinions on relevant scientitic
issues."

Although this provision dealt with
other areasot pesticide misuse, it tailed
to make any bait on the exportation oi
DDT and other insecticides deemed
dangerous.

The Federal insecticide, l"ungicide
and Rodenticide Actot1972 regulated
the "use ot pesticides to protect man
and his environment" and extended
Federal pesticide regulations to
actions entirely within a single state. It
also dealt with the improvement 0t
pesticide registration procedures and
regulation oi pesticide disposal and
provided tor research on pesticides,
alternatives and monitor use, and
presence in the environment.

Tire most recent action taken by the
EPA was against the Shell Chemical
Company to halt the production oi
aldrin and dieldrin, in that they are
considered a "high cancer risk," While
this issue is still in debate, EPA
administrator, Russell Train reports
that dieldrin has been tottnd to hamper
reproduction in birds, cause birth
detects iii monkeys as well as tindirig
its way into animal teed. This
necessitates the destruction oi the
contaminated animals.

The Shell Company has been
granted a hearing on the ban, as they
plan tor their 1975 production 0t
aldrin. it is a battle oi Shell Chemical
and the U .S. Department oi
Agriculture against the EPA and the
Envrronmenlal Detense Fund, or an
escalation oi the war between man and
nature.

Another trick that Cirillo uses is to tire

Under 'l‘cumster contract the iirst 30 driys oi'

work is ll probationary period where \the' ‘

worker can get fired for any reason. After 30
days the fannworker can gettired for not
performing adequate work or for political
rcrisons. This keeps workers from obtaining
eligibility for the medical plan.

In the Tcamster contract at Gallo. workers '
