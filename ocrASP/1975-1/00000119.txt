Geisser joked about SUNYA‘s
need for a dean altogether. “You
seemed to have done allright so far.”
he said.

The responsibilities and power of
a SUNYA Arts and Sciences Dean
are not clear. The position is held “at
the pleasure of the President" and no
written job description reallyexists.

Geisser said that two courses a
semester fcr each professor is
reasonable. He also said that he per-
sonally did not like lecture-style
classes but that some departments
did. He also approved of ACT (Stu-
dent Association's Assessment of
courses and teachers). calling it a
kind of “consumer‘s information

Conference

present at the pressconference. One
question directed speciﬁcally at her
dealt with the appropriateness of
U niversity control of student activity
funds levied and payed by the
students. Moore justiﬁed the broad
discretion now in the hands of Un-
iversity Presidents by saying that.
“They must have ﬁnal authority
because they have the final respon-
sibility.“

Most student media represen-
tatives felt the press conference.
which lasted about an hour and ten
minutes. was too short. Many
questions remained unanswered.
Among them was. why. after two
months of what SASU President
Dan Kohane described asﬁampant
rumors" about a pending rent hike.
and predictions by the Chancellor
that “necessary revenue will not be
achievable if rent and board rates re-
main the same." the top ad-
ministrative officials are apparently
in the dark about the threatened in-
crease in room rates.

In the January 24 issue of the
ASP. SUNYA‘s Vice President of
Management and Planning John
Hartley was quoted as having said
that “signals have been for no in-
crease. Normally if something like
that is being planned we would have
heard." President Benezet‘s Assis-
tant Ted Jennings. contacted thcday
before the meeting. said that.
although he wouldn‘t be surprised if
a rent hike were implemented. any
talk of such a move is still “strictly
rumor."

ALL ABOARD! Next stop-—
wukzserto. GERMANY!

Each year hundreds of SUNY
students study abroad in over ninety
countries. Many more students
would consider it but hold several
misconceptigns. I

‘ Mlsunderstandhg

One misunderstanding is that \
knowledge of a foreign language is
necessary. It is not and over one
fourth of the programs require only
English. Another idea that is mis-
constmed is that students go
overseas only to study the language
of the country. This is false. There
are programs such as the study of
Tropical Biology in Jamaica which
requires only that a student speak
English. Other programs in English
located in Great Britain offer
theater. landscape architecture and
dance. There are programs in
Liberal Arts, Social Sciences,
Humanities, Natural Sciences and
even specializations such as
oceanography.

Fees vary from country to coun-
try. However, a student pays only
SUNY tuition. This means all
scholarship and aid is applicable.
Room. board and expenses are
usually paid to the foreign govern-
ment. In actuality. the cost of a
semester or year abroad is not much
more than a semester or year in
Albany. A student applying for the
SUNY exchange program with
Moscow will actually pay less than a
semester in Albany. This includes
the cost ofair fare. tuition. room and
board and expenses.

In some countries. programs are
not yet available due to the instabili-
ty of the foreign government. In

countries such as China. the United
States would like to extend 1
program. But, according to D,
Charles Colman, Director of him:
national Studies. “They (1h.
Chtnese) want. to see how on,
relations are going to develop. wet]
be there as soon as they want us“

According to Dr. Colman, a 5i“.
dent who wanted to compare Am.
bian and lsreali cultures. who
wanted to study in botlt countries
would have some difficulty. Due to
recent lterrorists attacks. Arabian
countries will not permit entry to
any person whose passport is
stamped with an Israeli visa
Therefore. the student would run
have to study one semester in :in
Arab country, then study one
semester in Israel.

By far with Albany students the
most popular program (54 studcnu
this year) is a one year study In
Madrid. This program requires Ill
least two years of college Ictcl
Spanish or the equivalent. and a sur-
vey course in Spanish literature. /\

but would have to study ill ilfl

Way to Cut Costs  u of m

In a time of economic need, the
College Board's 20-year-old national
Advanced Placement Program is be-
ing rediscovered by parents and
students as a "new" way to save some
money on college costs. A national
summary lately published by the
Board shows a four percent increase
in schools participating in the
program, an increase of ll per cent
in the number of students involved

and a jump of 12 per cent in the ,

number of examinations taken by
students.

Students who took Advanced
Placement Courses in high school
and who entered college this fall sav-
ed their pa rents an average of $400 in
higher education costs. according to
College Board estimates. Based on
this calculation, students in New
York saved about $5,346,400—
money which otherwise would have
been required of their parents, or
drawn from hard-pressed ﬁnancial-
aid and scholarship sources in the
state.

New York was the leading state in
‘the nation in APP participation in
1974, with more schools involved in
the program (54l). more Advanced
Placement candidates (13.366), Md
a higher number of candidates from
all states sending AP scores to
colleges in New York (7.739) than
were sent to any otl'r‘e‘rnstate.

Ill Arliiiilthrtlll

Participation by students was up
l3 per cent. from I l.864 in I973 and
the number of participating secon-
daryschoolsalso increased byfactor
of seven percent. from fill in I973.
0f the state‘s l37l high schools. 40
per cent are AP schools.

Harlan Hanson, AP Program Of-
ﬁcer for College Board, reckons
APP students saved as much as $24
million nationwide. Dr. Hansot said

'of the program's growth, “It may

seem ironic for aprogramthat has
been around for 20 years. but it
appears Advanced Placement is a
program whose time has come.
Students see itas a “new” way to save

on college costs; schools see APP as ,

a "new" way to upgrade the
curriculum and improve high school
teaching; and colleges find APP
gives them opportunities to offer
students credit for what they know.“

At present, APP is offered byonly
about l5 per cent of the high schools
in thccountry and slightly more than
l5 per cent of the 350.000 eligible
American students have access to
APP. according to Dr. Hanson. A
few stateshave more than 40 percent
of the high schools as APP par-
ticipants. In one school. lrondcquoit

Don Brady, Vice President and
General Manager of the cab ﬁrm.
placed theboundaries of Sand Creek

Metroland taxi has been giving'ﬂat
rates of $2.50 to the campus from
'Colonie Center Mall, said Brady.'.
“They‘re taking away our business
up in that area and we want it back.
We also feel that the students have
given the company a good deal of

business in the "past  we'd like, to

showsour appreciation for their
patronage." ', .. j j ' .’

The possibility of having a taxi
stand on the campus was introduced
by Brady. “If the University would
allow a taxi stand up there. I would
love to have it."‘Brady went on to
mention that it would be advan-
tageous to students and drivers alike.
It would eliminate the calling and
waiting besides giving drivers a cen-
tral location for pickups. “I would
like to see the University administra-
tion consider the idea.“

Since the companies merged on
February l4. Capitol City and

said Fineman.

When this reporter confronted

"If students experience any

straighten it out right aivay. They
