HYPNOTIC ASSASSIN

(ZNS) A tamer F.B.l. agent and
a Los Angeles private investigator
are out with a new report. chiming
that convicted assassin Sirhan
Sirhan w‘as “hypnotically
programmed" by others to ﬁre shots
at Senator Robert Kennedy.

The new study was presented to
the American Academy of Forensic
Sciences in Chicago last week by
former F.B.l. agent William Tamer
and investigator John Christian. The
two men claim that Sirhan was a
kind of “Manchurian candidate“
who had been hypnotically
programmed to fire shots at Senator
Kennedy while a second assassin ac-
tually ﬁred the fatal bullets from a
second gun.

The researchers quote material
gathered during Sirhan‘s I969 trail
after Sirhan was interviewed by Un-
iversity of California psychiatrist
Doctor Bernard Diamond. Doctor
Diamond found. when he placed
Sirhan in hypnotic tranccs. that
Sirhan had been repeatedly hyp-
notized before.

Turner and Christian suggest that
Sirhan was programmed to intercept
Kennedy in the pantry area of the
Ambassador Hotel and to create a
commotion by firing shots in the
Senator‘s direction. The two in-
vestigato rs argue that a second man.
an armed security guard also in the
pantry. then pulled his weapon dur-
ing the confusion and fired three
shots into Senator Kennedy at close
range.

(ZNS) The F.B.I.. in a recently
declassiﬁed report. says that there
has been a sudden increase in the
number of extortionists threatening
to explode atomic bombs in
American cities. '

Two F.B.l. officials reveal that in
I974. the F.B.l. quietly investigated
seven bomb threats involving alleged
atomic explosives.

None of the threats thus far have
turned out to be valid ones. the

bureau says: but the F.B.l. predicts
that the number of nuclear scares
will increase during the next few
years.

Nuclear experts have warned that
'terrorists could steal 200r morelbs
of plutonium and then could easily
manufacture a home-made bomb
capable of leveling the downtown
area gfan American city.

The Atomic Energy Commission
revealed last year that many hun-
dreds of pounds of plutonium are
“unaccounted for" at US. atomic
facilities. The Commission says.
however. that the material most
probably disappeared during nor-
mal chemical processes and that
there is no evidence that terrorists
have obtained any.

In India. however. police officials

report ’that hundreds of pounds of

processed uranium had been stolen
from nuclear plants and then sold by
smugglers on the international black
market. _

EXPENSIVE HENRY:

(ZNS) The monthly newsletter
Washington Watch reports that the
secret service spent 5800.000 to
protect Henry Kissinger in fiscal
I974.

The cost of guarding Kissinger.
however. has goneup like everything
else: it is estimated that security for
the Secretary of State during I975
will be as high as $1 million.

U.F.O. BOOKIES

(ZNS) The British Unidentified
Flying Object Research Organim-
tion ltas put its 700 “flying saucer“
watchers on special alert. predicting
that there will be sensational
sightings over England over the next
few months.

The UFO. organization is so
confident ofnew sightings that it has
released a set ofeight step-by—step in—
structions on what to do ifyou see a
U.F.O. The instructions tell
observers how to make sure their
eyes aren‘t playing tricks on them.
how to photograph flying space
ships and how to estimate how far
away they are.

One advisory report even predicts
what space people will look like. It
says that space creatures will
probably "be about 4-feet. six inches
to 5-fcet tall. with large heads and
eyes that seem to go part of the way
around their heads. They have no
observable lips. but a slit for a
mouth." The report adds: “It is not
clear whether they have necks or
legs.“

One British flying saucer huff has
placed a. lotiti-to-l odds bet with a
licensed bookie in London that "A
U.F.(). with an alien being front
another planet will land or crash on
the Earth before the end ofth year."

FAST anass ﬁtting

TON.

(ZNS) A Brookﬁeld, Illinois, zoo
is growing grass as fast as it can be
planted. and it isn’t the kind you
walk on.

Brookfield Zoo says it is produc-
ing 400 pounds of “Fast Grass” each
day as a cost-saving food supple-
ment for its animals.

As zoo Commissary Manager

. Dewey Garvey tells it. 20 pounds of
“Fast Grass" can be grown in a mere
seven days with only three poundsof
seed. Fast Grass. he says. grows

' about an inch is day. Garvey claims

the 100 is already saving more than
$5,000 a year in food bills simply by
growing its own stuff. -

Which zoo occupant eats the most
Fast Grass? Garvey reports that
Ziggy. the largest elephant in captivi-
ty. swills down at least 20 pounds of
the stuff a day. sprinkled liberally in
his daily 400 pound food rtion.

HUMPBACK BIRTH
CONTROL

(ZNS) An oceanographer who
studies the Humpback Whales sing-
ing habits says the massive creatures
are not serenading each other: In-
stead. he says. they are practicing

birth control.

Doctor Howard Winn reports he
has found that when a colony of
whales becomes overpopulated. the
group singing becomes too much.
The sound. he says. penetrates the
whale and upsets its reproductive
systems. This. Winn states. cuts
down the whale population con-
siderably.

CHARMER NO MONK
KILLER

(ZNS) An Austrian court has
found an 82-year-old snake charmer
innocent of murdering a Tibetan
monk 640 years ago.

The snake cha rmer had claimed he
had committed the crime in an
earlier life.

The court ruled that the statue of .

limitations had run out on the
murder. Besides that. the Austrain
court stated that it had no jurisdic-
tion overcrimes committed in Tibet.

That same court. however. ruled
that an assistant to the snake
charmer was guilty of extortion. The
assistant had collected and spent the
snake ehanner‘s life savings by
claiming he could use the money to
absolve the old man of the murder.

vasion plan. code named "Dhahran

producing nations by American
troops in the event a Mideast War

Option Four“ wasdrawn up by Pres-
dent Ford. Nelson Rockefeller.
Henry Kissinger. C.l.A. Director
William Colby and Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs ofStaffGeorge Brown.

to cut and then occupy the Ghawar
oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia. and for

pects to have 40.000 American
troops on the ground in the middle
