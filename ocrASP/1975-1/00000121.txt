V I  at the Brink

ln behavior strikingly reminiscent of the old Republican dominated Legislature, the
state government played eleventh hour brinksmanship with what many in government
felt to'be the basis of the state's solvency. On Tuesday afternoon, the New York State
Urban Development Corporation, a S l . 1 billion housing construction ﬁrm went broke
when it defaulted on Sl00 million in bond anticipation notesdue that day. At eleven
pm. Tuesday night. the state Assembly went into emergency session to construct a new

agency to pick up the pieces, and the debt, of the U.D.C.

Governor Carey then introduced his Project Finance Agency bill. realizing that
there had to be some action from the Legislative branch that night or the blame for the
fiscal collapse of the state. which he hinted was possible, would be squarely on its
shoulders. The Assembly answered the call. simply because they are Democratically
controlled, and it would appear absurd if a Republican Senate met at midnight to bail

out the Democratic Governor while the Assemblymen slept.

The Governor's P.F.A. bill was 36 pages long, more pages than

most
Assemblymen read all session, to say nothing of two hours. Playing classic majority
politics. Majority Leader Al Blumenthal kept his Democrats behind the doors of the
Democratic Caucus until he and Speaker Stanley Steingut were convinced that the
necessary 76 votes were ready. in the intervening hours between the bill‘s introduction
and the onset of the session. the debate was not about the merits of the bill. Indeed.

troducer'. was not aware when asked that this agency would commit the state to an ap-

propriation of $40 million a year over the next forty years.

The sad part of this U.D.C. story is not that the Assemblymen had to meet at mid-
night. nor that they were forced to pass a bill that no one had read. The shame of how
( arey handled this issue was that he allowed it to get to the point were nothing short of
heroic last—second action could save the state from a crippling ﬁnancial crisis: Months
ago. leaders in state government were aware of the critical condition 0fth U.D.C. It
should have been no surprise to Carey that the banks. a natural ally to former Gover~

nor Rockefeller. would not snap at a chance to be friendly with Carey.

'I he same bill which had to be rushed through the entire legislative process in less
than 24 hours could have been handled far more efficiently had the Governor brought
his package to the Legislature weeks ago. That way. ltowever. the Governor would not
have receiyed the headlines and publicity he got. nor would he have been considered
the hero of thcday‘ as he is now. it won‘t be too long. however. before more and more
people realize the implications of thc I’.F.A. bill. and regret the way in which they were

coralled.

Carey has behaved exactly the way Wilson and Rockefellerbehayed before him. His
last-minute actions wercdcsigned to goad the Legislature into rallying to his side on the
impulse ofdefending the state. a gut. emotional response that would have undoubtedly
been overshadowed had the time been available for the representatives to consider

what they were doing.

But the Governor allowed no time for thought. and it may be to his future-discredit

that he opted to go for the immediate glory.
