B and vs R

by Stephen Ladenheim

A Bishop and 2 connected passed
pawns vs. Rook gives great winning
chances to the first side. What usual-
ly happens is that the connected
pawns get rolling, subjecting the
defending Rook to a hopelessly
passive position.

In a game between David Chu and
this writer from last September‘s
New York State Championship.
White's connected passed pawns
proved too mobile to restrain.

Exchanges at move 10. left Black
with doubled and isolated Queen
pawns and gave White the initiative.
White‘s l4.P-N5 threatened to lock
in Black‘s King Bishop with 15.1’-
N6. The point of Chu‘s clever l4

Tricks and Trumps

by Henry Jacobson

0n defense. what is the best way to
try to defeat contracts? One way is
simply to try to count the distribu-
tion ofdeclarer‘s suits. This method
usually supplies answers as to what
suit to leadat a given point, which
suits to save if dcclarcr is running a
long suit. and so forth. Thc only
catch isthat it is personally annoying
to have to stop for a prolonged
period oftime just to reconstruct the 1
hidden hand. Moreover. it is a
further blow to be haunted by
suspicions that dcclarcr, or worse.
your own partner. would like you to
play any card at all,jtist to finish the
hand. llutasa dcfender.ii isyourjob
to find out the best way possible to
defeat the contract (assuming there
is a way). The few extra moments
spent to ponder will be well worth
the pain in thc longrun. l.ct‘slook at
a hand.

Contract: 4 Spadcs<Sottth
Opening Lead: Ace of Hearts

After South opens the bidding
with | Spade the final contract
becomes 4 Spades. The opening lead
is the Heart Ace,and Westcontinucs
that suit at trick two. which declarcr
rails. The Queen of Spades is led
from the closed hand. and you as
West. dttck. on general principles.
The Spade King is led next and you
win this trick. as partnershows out.

At this point many Wests would
cash the Ace of Clubs ﬁguring to
“take it while lean. since South‘s los-
ing clubs can be thrown off on the
diamonds." Closer analysis.
however, shows this to be false
reasoning.

11 we stop to count deelarcr‘s
hand. we find he had 5 Spades and I
Heart. For South to be ath to make
use of dummy‘s luscious diamonds.
he must hold Ace and at least
another. 11' South holds but two
diamonds then he would be left
holding 5 Clubs; therefore. only
three of them can be thrown on the
diamonds. That means, on the
diagrainmcd deal, that South is left
with two losing clubs: down one. in-
stcad o1 making. if West does not
cash his Club Ace.

11 South has three diamonds
originally land 5 Spades and |
Hull”) he would then have four
('luhs. And only two Clubs can be
thrown on thediamonds: down one.
again. il West does not get cold feet
aml cash his Ace.

All that w as required to dcfeat this
hand was for one member ofthe
defense to reconstruct Joclarer's
hand. which merely involves coun-

ting up to 13.
