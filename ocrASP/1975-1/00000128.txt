Recruiting Violations

by Alex Sachure

NEW YORK (AP) College
basketball recruiting is one ﬁeld in
which women are not looking for
equality with men. They'd just as
soon avoid the mistakes made by
their male counterparts, thank you.

With the recent introduction of
athletic ischolarshipsi for women. n
Pandora's box has been opened.onc
which many women's basketball of-
ﬁcials are very wary of as their sport
grows by leaps and bounds.

"Women are getting into
recruiting now. although it's not as
high pressured as the men." said

Lucille Kyvallos,thedynamiccoach
of Queen College's nationally promi-
nent women's basketball team. “But
when you have scholarships. there
might be pressure in future years.

“Women have to try and avoid the
mistakes made by men. Many
women didn‘t want to get into the
scholarship hag. We didn't want to
get in. butnow we're forced in—~and
we‘ve got to be careful."

Cathy Rush. coach of three-time
national champion Immaculate.
which defeated Queens 65-61 Satur-
day before nearly 12,000 at Madison

for caution.

“Where there are scholarships.
there is going to be recruiting going
on." Mrs. Rush said. “Without good
regulations. women‘s basketball
could fall prey to the men's
problems. But women have seen

‘ what happened tojthe men—that

could be thcbest thing going forus.”

While some schools give athletic
scholarships to women. Immaculate
and Queens do not. Immaculata is
14-2 this season. losing to William
Penn and Federal City. which also
don't give women athletic
scholarships.

Nonescholarshhs schools

Can the non-scholarship schools
continue to compete?

“I think we can.but it willbcmuch
harder," said Mrs. Rush. whose 88-6
record at Immaculata has earned
that tiny. 525-studcnt women‘s
school outside of Philadelphia the
reputation as the UCLA of women‘s
basketball.

Queens. a division of the City Un-
iversity of New York. has only
moderate tuition fees but no
scholarships.

“We do‘it‘lt'tﬁlurlmpcmtvhcl'ngs going
for us." Miss Kyvallos said. “We
have a highly developed women‘s
program and we have many schools
in the city from which to attract
players. So if someone from the city
wants to play women‘s basketball on
a nationally competitive level. she
can do that at Queens.

“llut with other schools giving
scholarships and all. I'm not sure for
how long we can compete.”

Cobanc. the team's coach. “the team
has a good chance of placing
anywhere from eighth through
eleventh place.“

The team ended its season by plac-
ing second in a four-way meet held
last weekend at Stony Brook. they
fell only to Brooklyn College who
managed to muster up 71% points
to Albany's 70.69. This was the
highest tcant score for the season and
many of the girls broke their in-
dividual records.

Cathy Capcrna did an excellent
job. placing ﬁrst in the vaulting com-
petition with a 7.66 (8.5 being the
highest). Julie Acton achieved a 7.2.
her highest all season. on the bars.
and Mary Ot'fring managed a third
place ﬁnish with a score of 0.25.

The team c'itdcd their autism 7-9
with wins over New I‘altz. Buffalo
State and Custlcton. Albany bome
to Cortland. Brockport. Ithaca and
C unisius. who overpowered the team
three times.

con/inner] from page sixteen

by David Thomson. while 12 fouls
were called. Ray Gay and Bob
Luciano hit three and two foul shots
respectively versus two for Lajeuncss
to make it a 66-55 ﬁnal.

Coach Lewis criticized his players'
second half performance “for a lack
of patience and poor shot selection."
Despite this, and an inability to con-
trol the opposing center. the Pops
improved their record to 14 winsand
4 losses (Marist is 10—5). The Pups
out-rebounded Marist. caused many
turnovers, and pressed effectively at
times. seemingly able to turn it on
when the situation warranted.

Aubrey Brown with 16. Ray Guy
with 14 (4 for 4 in the second half).
and David Thomson with 10 were
the top 3 scorers for Albany. La-
jeuness led all scorers with 22 and
McKee had 13 in a losing effort.
