" ' If so. then you know this can present -

a slight problem. You can either wait
in the hall, make a brief stop in the
library, or run over to the Campus
Center. But now you have a new
alternative-Abe brightly colored. all-

located in room 354 on the third

' can be obtained for the reasonable
price of IS cents each, two for 30
cents. and for-those of 'you who go
for donuts in a really big way (and
can ignore the battle of the bulge), IO
donuts for the incredibly low prieeof
SI.50. New there’s an offer that‘s
hard to refuse!

Both the donuts and coffee are
well liked by visitors who tend to
consume 5 dozen donuts a day.
which costs the Lounge about 35
dollars a week. Some of thesedonuts
are dunked in 90 cups of coffee; an
amount easily sipped around the 9
am. arrival. The “all new Lounge”
had its grand opening on February
I0th.

There are other features of the
Lounge besides refreshments. It has
been totally remodeled—a job that
volunteer faculty and students ac-
complished in three hours one Fri-
day afternoon. The new decor in-

ment, refreshment consumers have
been paying for the food through an
honesty system. if during any one
week extra money or a “proﬁt” is
found in the coffee box, the money
will be returned to the initial con-
tributors. According to Mike Kauf-
man the honesty system is working
with very few ripoffs. The Lounge
currently is a self-supporting. non-
proﬁt endeavor.

Mike Kaufman feels the Lounge'

was a “spontaneous idea." It began
“because many people in the
building felt there was a need for a
place for faculty and students to
come together and talk." It can
replace faculty—student hall talks as
well as give color and human life to
the vertical white walls of SUNYA.

The Lounge is a place where the
people on the second ﬂoor can get to
know people on the third floor.
Some even bring theirtlunch..Kauf-
man quickly added. “if we branch
out to hamburgers. I'll let you know
immediately.“

The Lounge still can be reserved
for faculty m'eetings and poetry
readings. but for the most part the
room is open. Right now the Lounge
is in need ofa name. Anyone with a
suggestion may give it to any com—
mittee member. Obscenities will not
be tolerated.

Mike Kaufman feels. “The big
question will be if it picks up again
next fail. if it does, then the Lounge
will be an ongoing thing—mot just
something for one semester.“

Doomsday Machines

Soaring

(ZNS) The Air Force reports
that the costs of the so-callcd
“Doomsday flight Machines" are
soaring out of sight.

The “Doomsday Flight
Machines“ are six specially-designed
Boeing 747 jumbo jets which are
assigned to fly the President of the
United States and his staff to safety
in the event of a nuclear war.

The heavily-shieldedplanes—now
under construction —will be packed
with automatic computers and the
most sophisticated radio equipment
in existence.

Under the Pentagon's nuclear war
contingency plan. the President. the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. 18 ranking military officers
and 59 key yspccimlsts‘ andﬂagdvisors

in the event ofa nuclear showdown.

The planes would then take off.

The Air Force reports. however.
that large cost-overruns are plaguing
the three-year old doomsday air-
plane project. The cost of the six
planes. the Air Force says. have
nearly doubled. soaring to $560
million (dollars). and even higher
costs are predicted.

The big 747‘s are being readied to
replace a ﬂeet of three 707's because
the jumbo jets will be roomier. and
more Pentagon and White House
staff officials will be able to climb
aboard.

However. Senator John Stcnnis.

Disrupt Radicals

(ZNS) A former undercover
operative for the F. B.l. has told The
New York Times that the Bureau
continued to use cointel-pro type
tncitcs until at least June of last
year—despite repeated Justice
Department assurances that the
program had been discontinued in
l97l.

“Cointel-pro“ was a l7-ycar effort
on the part ofthe F.B.l. to infiltrate.
disrupt and destroy so~called radical
organizations in the United States.
The existence of the programw
which reached its peak during the
Nixon administration—was con-
tirmcd last year by the Justice
Department following the filing ofa
civil suit.

The former operative. Joseph
Burton. told the Times that as late as

June of l974. he was involved in a
variety of activities aimed at
neutralizing so-callcd radical
political efforts. including the for-
mation of “Sham” revolutionary
groups. ,.

groups Burton said he formed for the
liurcau was a group called “The Red
Star Cadre.“ Burton said the F.B.l.
supplied him with everything from
operating funds to even T—shirts

Creatures Smelt

(ZNS) The Mutual U.F.O.
Network —-a “flying saucer“ research
group based in Quincy. Illinois:—
says that hundreds of 'residents in
Pennsylvania have reported
sighting—and even smelling——
strange creatures with glowing‘red

eyes.

Stan Gordon. a researcher with
the organization. says that the
creatures are described as hulking.
long-anned. with three-toed foot-
prints. and alwayswith glowing eyes.
Gordon suggests that the strange
creatures have been planted on the
earth for experimental reasons by
space beings.

Gordon says that in I973. there
Were ll8 such sightings reported by
245 eye witnesses. He says that most
of the sightings occurred in the
mountains of western Pennsylvania.
and that the descriptions turned in
by both children and adults were
“chillingly consistent.“

Gordon's theory is that galactic
cxplorcrs have deposited some kind
of experimental creatures which he
believes are "remotely controlled by
it radio signal similar to the way that
we track dolphins through the
water.“
