Bicycle Thieves Here

Vittorio DeSica, ltaly‘s great
movie director. actor, producer and
writer. whodied this past November
in Paris, will becommcmorated this
Wednesday night, March 5 by the
Italian-American Student Alliance
with the presentation of one of his
finest films “The Bicycle Thief."

Set in postwar Rome, "The Bicy-
cle Thief". tells the story of a poor
bill-posterwho has occasion to make
an urgent and desperate appeal to
the police. His bicycle. the last
valuable thing he owns, has been
stolen. Without it he will lose hisjob
and be deprived of the only way to
support his wife and child.

The police ofﬁcer is impassive.
“Rome is full of bicycles," he says.
“It would take every man on the
police force to search for a missing
one. This sort of thing is a nuisance.
it happens dozens of times every
day."

The poor man is dumbfounded.

“Did anyone witness the in-
cident?” the officerwearily inquires.

“People saw it, sure, but nobody
cared..."

That one line ontains the bitter es-
sence of the rueful and devastating
theme of this beautifully pure and
tender picture: People see. but
nobody cares.

DeSica's intent in “The Bicycle
Thief“ is to make us care, to view
with concern and compassion one
isolated instance of misfortune in a
troubled world. He wants to leave us
so attached to these small victims
that our eyes and hearts should be
forever more alert.

In making plans for this picture,
DeSica recognized that it could onl

be done with pictorial authority in
authentic settings and preferably
with a real-life cast. Finance was not
easy to come by. and for a brief time
DeSica was lured by an offer from
David 0. Sclznich to put up the
money for the film. Selznich‘s choice
for the Roman bill-poster was Cary
Grant. and DeSica. for all his
eagerness to get some money, could

Fonda was “not box office."
Negotiations were fortunately

Tomorrow night will be a special

play begins.

The setting of the play is in the
Great Smoky Mountains, a range of
mountains that lies in North
Carolina and Tennessee. The play
containsa great deal of the mountain
ﬂavor. The characters are mountain
folk—gossipy, lazy, wary of out-
siders and highly superstitious.
Scenes inclttdc a country square
dance. a general store, a church
revival meeting. and a place high up
on the mountain where witches live.
The play is a blending of these
Smoky Mountain elements with the
supernatural.

Dhrk of Ihc Moon was a
collaboration between Howard
Richardson and William Berncy.
The first draft was written by
Richardson in the early l940‘s as a
fulfillment for a graduate course in
theatre at the University of lowa. In
I944 it received its first production
outside of lowa U., in Mass. at the
Cambridge Summer Theatre. The
show was well received. and the next
year it went on to Broadway for an
extended run. It has had four
revivals on Broadway since then (a
fifth one is in fact planned for this
year, attd is now at the audition
phase of production).

Op'era'l'tas" new perh/a'ps gained
some sort of {foothold at SUNYA
with its extremely successful perfor-
mances of two comic operas this past
weekend, Hayden's La Camarina
and Johnson's Tire Four-Note
Opera, both “opera parodies." pok-
ing fun at the operatic form.

I found the Hayden piece quite
boring. Aside from the charming
music played beautifully by a
chamber orchestra,,eompletc with
harpsichord, the plot of the opera
was quite poor. The “ﬂow” was very
bumpy, events happening much too
quickly. Marjory Fuller was in very
ﬁne voice, but her stage presence was
less than i would have liked to have
seen. The cantarina. Anne Turner,
had an equally ﬁne voice, but she
had no real opportunity to show it
off until the end of the piece. Brad
Logan did not look orsound the part
of a lover. His movements were
much too stiff and uncomfortable-
looking. and he looked much too
young to be the cantarina's lover.
Abraham Mizrahi as the Maestro-
cum-love-r of the cantarina was
superb. His mugging, rantings and
ravings. abng with his lovely tenor
voice. gave the opera its real comic
glow. The period costumes for the
piece, and the wing-and-drop set, a
convention of the period, lent much
to the atmosphere, but not quite
enough to sustain my interest.,

On the other hand. i thought that
The Four-Nate Opera was absolute-
ly delightful. While the voices of the

students were not as strong as those

of the professionals, the students
should be commended for their
talents. This opera was doubIc-cast

'both casts perform. Each perfor-

mance had a slightlydifferent ﬂavor,
but on the whole l was very pleased
with this opera. The staging and
costumes were quite simple. but that
was enough the singers took over
from there. This opera made obvious
fun at duels, rivalry between singers.
mad scenes, love ducts, and all those
other conventions of opera that we
all know and love.

The voices were exceptionally
good. The Sopranos, Sandra
Ncuman and Debra Lipkowitz, had

different feelings for their part, es-

pecially evident during the Mad
Scene. Ncuman was a wild-eyed
Ophelia, tossing flowers this way
and that. while LipkOWii’l. was more
like a paranoiac let out of some
asylum. Very different but both
equally as effective. Different, too.
were their voices. Ncuman's voice is
light and airy, while Lipkowitz‘s is
dusky and lyric. lint again the per-
formances were equally fine.

Not so with the Tenor and
Baritone parts. The Tenors, Charles
Varadian and Michael (irill were
both good, but in different ways.
Grill has a very nice voice. but he is
not quite an actor. Varadian's voice
was not as good. but his acting was
beautiful his facial expressions were
priceless.

l.ce Bcbcrman and Robert
