._rebuilding yearyfo‘r St. Lawrence as
they lost three starters from last
' year's squad. But midway through
' this season. the Saints put it"‘a'll
together and won ten, straight
. ballgames. They have beaten some
of the better Division III schools. in-
cluding LeMoyne (winners over
Siena), Potsdam. Hobart. St. John’s
Fisher. Alfred and Ithaca. who gave
Albany all sorts of trouble.

“They are a good basketball
team.‘ said RPI coach Kallbaugh.
whose team beat the Saints earlierin
the year. "They are a little bigger
than Albany as they haveacouple of
forwards who-go 6‘ 5“....They are a
rugged bunch of kids."

The man to watch out for is guard
Jim Young. the team’s leading
scorer. He has been averaging twen-
ty points a game andhis'shooting has
been phenomenal. hitting 67 per cent
from the ﬁeld. The Danes will also
have to contend with the Saint‘s 6‘ 5"
center. Tony Ross. Ross has been
averaging eleven points a game. He
is a 60 per cent shooter from the ﬁeld
but most of his points come from in
close. -

At forward are 6‘ 5" Rob Lalonde.
the team's third leading scorer(l0.7)
and 6‘ 2" Mark Garrow (I0.3). The
other guard is 5‘ 7“ Don Watkins.

“We have no standouts on our
eluh.just five guys playing together."
said St. Lawrence Coach Paul
Evans. One of his team's strong
points is an excellent bench. Jim

, . “You have to make Brockport the
favoiitef‘said Albany State varsity
basketball coach Doctor Richard
Sauers. and such is the consensus of
the other three coaches involved in
the tournament. including
Brockport’s Mauro Panaggio. '

There are four good reasons for
seeding Brockport number one:

I. Their'record and seasonal play:
2I-3. including wins over Morgan
State. Maryland Eastern Shore. Buf-
falo State. and Oneonta. Their only
losses came at the hands oftop rank-
ed Division II CW. Post. NCAA’
Tournament-bound Hartwick and
Albany State. '

2. The home court advantage:
always’a key factor. particularly in
intercollegiate basketball where in-
timidation of officials by home
crowd fans is accepted. “The home
advantage. or actually. the crowd
compostition. can be worth as many
as I5 points.‘f saidlAI‘bany‘sﬂom

Morphishafter the Great Danes beat
Brockport in Albany 72-67.

3. The experience: Brockport has
been there before. winning this very
same tournament two yearsago.

Brockport lost to Albany State
with McTaw fouled out of the game;
Brockport edged Buffalo State to
win the SUNY Conference with Me-
Taw.who scored 24 and pulled down
I9 rebounds while blocking five
shots.

After McTaw the Golden Eagles
start Kevin "Bambi" Williams, a 6'8”

McTaw‘s brilliance versus Buffalo

Ihe Panaggio brothers. Dan (I7

guards. Neither played well against

offensively versus Buffalo State,

Can R.P.I. handle McTaw and

Fresh off a. big win over Williams
College (the only team to beat
Albany at Albany this year), the
Engineers will play a patient work-
ing game. and may give Brockport
plenty to cope with. Letterman
center Carey Dassatti at 6’6" can get
up there with McTaw. and might be
able to give Mc'l'aw some trouble.

they gotoff to a quick stari. winning
their first four games. In their open-
ing contest they beat Colgate at
Colgate for the first time in I8years.
RPI's 12-7 record is a littledeceiv-
ing as they have lost to some tough
opposition. Union has beaten them
twice. Albany beat RBI in the con-
solation round of the Capital Dis-
triet‘ tournament, 83-78. The
Engineer‘s four remaining losses
were to Division | Cornell.
Rochester. RIT and Brandeis
College. New England's top ranked
Division III school. RPI‘s other big
victories came against St. Lawrence
in overtime and Williams College.
Much of the Engineers attack is
dependent on senior co-captain
Carey DaSatti,‘ the team‘s 6‘6"
center. This will be especially true in
the Brockport game. He is a three
year starter. havingplayedgpttt’l‘s
NCAA team of two years ago. He
has averaged 1 L7 points a game and
provides much of the team‘s reboun-
ding. Carey will have the respon—

,the team's third leading scorer and
the team's playmaker and Bill

Susetka. the team‘s co-captain and
top defensive ballplayer. These men
will have to guard the Panaggio
brothers.

The team doesn‘t get much scoring ,

from its bench. Dave Subatka and
Ken Kubiak give the Engineers some
much,necded depth at theIforward
positions. The third guard is Dave
Mehalick.

RPI likes to use a deliberate
offense. always working for the good
shot. If the opportunity prevails.
they will fast break. The Engineers
like their opponents to play a man to
man defense. If they are ahead. RPI
will stall to force the opposition out
of the zone defense;

RPI has never played Brockport.
The Engineers are a smaller club
than the Eagles. The team is basing
its optimism on the ability of the
shorter Albany State team to beat
Brockport. When RI’I lost this year.
they were usually beaten in the mid-
dle. That is where Brockport's
strength lies. 'I'o beat the Eagles. RI’I
must try to Wear their opponents
down. They cannot afford to play
deliberate basketball. I’i'v/t' RI'I gets
a fast ticket to the consolation
round—LBrockport 90 Rl’l 64.

 Bid Rekindles Memorieso

'by Bruce Manhs.

The year was I969._The University
celebrated its l25th anniversary.
Janis Joplin I played the Gym.
Students were clamoring for a
change from their mandatory meal-
plan. The school, as a whole was
growing into the new uptown cam-
pus. For basketball historians. 1969
was the year Albany State recechd
its ﬁrst and until this year. its only
bid to compete in the NCAA basket-
ball tournament. .

One year before (1967—68), the l8-
4 Danes were denied a bid to that
same tournament. as the NCAA felt
that Albany‘s schedule was too easy.
Doc Sauers still believes that his ‘68
team was better than his NCAA
club.

Optimism reigned in the late fall of
I968 its the basketball season ap-
proached. mainly due to the return
of Rich Margison. the Dancs'
leading scorer from the previous
year and Scott Price. the team's
leading rebounder. The team was
basically a five man squad with Jack
Jordan. Jack Adams and Jack
Caverly rounding out the starting
ﬁve. The Danes were also optimistic
because they finally had a
hornecourt of their own. with the
opening of University (iym.

()nconta and like the ‘75 club. lost to
the Dragons. Albany returned home
and heat Stony Brook. 57-52. The
Danes then lost their next two out of
three on the road. before holiday
break.

llut the Danes caught ﬁre. win-

ning their next eleven games. They
camed the nickname. the cardiac
kids, as they continually pulled
games out in the closing seconds.
The streak started with a win over St.
Lawrence. Albany‘s opponent in the
ﬁrst round of this year‘s NCAA‘s.
Albany took the Capital District
Tournament. beating Sicns 59-58 in
the ﬁnals. Next it was a victory over
Merrimack College. 76-75.

Danes were 8-5. They beat
Hartwick. 77-76 in overtime. Albany
then played two of their most ex-
citing games. coming back to book.
First it was Brooklyn College. The
Danes were tied 6666 and BC had
the ball in the closing seconds. BC
turned the ball over. The Danes in-
bounded to Margison. whose

Mary'son and his shot bounded
around the fan and dropped as the
buzzer sounded. giving Albany its
eighth win in a row. Winsover Ithaca
and Hobart brought the ster to
eleven before arch rivaISiena ﬁnally
beat the Danes. But the Danes
rebounded. beating Southern Conn.
and Utica before reeeivingword that
they had been invited to the NCAA
tournament.

The cardiac kids celebrated their

bid by losing to New Paltz on
Albany's homecourt. This was the
Danes‘ first loss at University Gym.
as this club established the winning
tradition at home. Albany closed out
the regular season with a win over
Oswego. ‘
I But now it was on to the NCAA
tourna ment. hosted by LeMoyne at
Syracuse. The Danes were going to
play the pre-tourney favorite
Wagner College. while LeMoyne
met Montclair in thc nightcap Fri—
day. March ’I.

The Great Dane fans didn‘t listen
to the words of the experts. 'lhere
were bon fires and rallies startingon
the Sunday before and lasting
throughout the week. On Monday a
band enjoyed the support of up-
wards of Low students. as they
paraded from one quad to another.
ﬁnally ending up in front of the
Campus Center.

Ilut‘the rallies didn‘t help the
basketball train that Friday. as they
were crushed by Wagner I09-64,
putting them in the consolation
game the following evening against
LeMoyne. losers to Montclair St.

The Danes were embarrassed by
their loss to Wagner and they wanted
to prove that they werea better team
than they showed the night before.
But LcMoync took a lbpoint lead at
half time as Margison and Company
were held in check.

In the second half the Danes ﬁnal-
Iy put it all together. Margison. play-

with 30 seconds left they changed
their strategy. as they threw up a shot

boards for Albany and it was now
the Danes‘ turn to play for the ﬁnal
shot.

The clock showed under ten '
seconds when Margison got theball. " -
He tried a driving layup. but heendv-

Richie mlmly sunk the3tirsl. shot. en-,
suring Albany‘s victory. Typically
the cardiac kids closed out the
season with another one point vic-
tory. winning 71-70. The Danes had
800 fans in the stands for that game
and Doc Sauers publicly prochsimed
that the fan support was instnsmen-
tal in the upset victory.

For his effort that year. Margison
was voted ECAC Division II player
of the year. He had averaged 22.I
points for the yearand set numerous
Albany scoring records that still
stand today (most points in a
season-~530. most points in a

three year career at Albany and is
remembered as the greatest Albany
