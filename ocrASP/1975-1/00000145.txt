Bass Night. last Monday in the
PAC Recital Hall provided the
audience with a unique experience
into the structure. function and
sound of the double bass. The most
rarely heard solo instrument of the
orchestral ensemble was presented in
an almost comical, elaborate exhibi-
tion. David A. Cobb. teacher, com-
poser. and performer. inspired his
corps of both music majors and
younger students from the com-
munity in a diverse program sur-
veyingfully the limited range ofWorks
for the double bass. '

A number of factors contributed
to our impression: the difficulty of
attuning our, ears to the lower
register ofthe instrument; the formal
tux and tail attire of some per-
formers. combined with tbe casual
format of the evening; the inten-
tional comedy of some of the selec—
tions. The sensitivity of the instru-
ment was best exemplified in Cobb‘s
interpretation of Max Bruch's Kol
Midrei. His style was both smooth
and expressive. Other works. e.g.
“Jazt on Rye“ and P.D.Q. ‘Bach‘s
"0 round Rounds“ attested to
humorous aspect of the bass; and
“Boston Harbor“. a contemporary
work illustrated the atonal effects
which the instrument is capable of
producing. Another novel effect was
produced at the end ofthe pragram.
where 23 bassi ﬁlled the Recital Hall
stage in a series of works for bass
ensemble. two of which were com-
posed by Cobb himself.

It was obvious that the performers

Several years ago the late Professor Paul
l’ettit directed a highly successful productiont
of Aristophanes‘ Lysistrala on the stage of
Page Hall.

Area lovers of theater will have an
opportunity now to view another local
production of Aristophanes‘ ribald comedy.
I.,r.ri.\-Ira!a will be performed at the
Schenectady Civic Playhouse from March l5
through March 22.

Old Comedy
Lyxixlralu belongs to the genre of Old

C omedy, a most remarkable and most
interesting branch of Greek literature. What

. Lysistrata

Wm  A"

are the essential features of this genre?

1. Old Comedy was emphatically relevant to
its own day; it dealt boldly with burning
political. moral and intellectual problems.
Many of these same problemsare still debated
today. and thus Old Comedy has much
relevance even to the twentieth century.

2. Old Comedy was uproariously funny. but
always had a serious message beneath the
coarse humor.

3. Old Comedy was intensely personal and
never hesitated to ridicule leading political
and intellectual ﬁgures. such as Cleon,
Socrates. or Euripides.

4. Old Comedy was very risque. in some of
its themes. in many of its allusions, and in

much of its vocabulary. The actors were
grotesque masks and ,, j
which included much padding and. for the
male roles. a large leather phallus.

Aristophanes I Dove

We know preciously little about the life of
Aristophanes; even the dates of his birth and
death are not accurately known. He produced
his first play in 427 BC. Ofa total of40 plays
only 11 are extant. He lived in an age of almost
constant war and of much political
turbulence. The Peloponnesian War (431-404
B.C.). the Corinthian War (395)386 B.C.).
and the twu oligarchic revolutions of 4H B.C.

and 404 BC. all fell into his lifetime. He was
much 4 with immediate political
issues; he disliked the extreme democrats and
their hawkish foreignaand military policy.

Lysistram was performed in 4! I B.C., when
the situation in Athens wasdesperatc. it is one
of Aristophanes“ three peace plays. It is a
dream about peace. as preposterous and
ludicrous as it is fascinating and interesting:
the women of both Athens and Sparta.led by
Lysistrata (“Dissolver of Armies") engage in a
sex strike. i.e. they resolve to withold marital
privileges from their husbands until the latter
have concluded peace. If you would like to
know whether the plan worked go to see the
play.
