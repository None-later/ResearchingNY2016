Pups Could Provide Talent-fin"

by Miss PIekerdsi

“Overall, they accomplished more
than I expected when they first
assembled." And with that
statement—almost an
understatement—Coach Robert
Lewis summed up the season and
closed the books on the 1974-75
junior Varsity basketball squad; the
second best in Albany State history.

Finishing at l4.and Sand scttinga
record for consecutive wins by the
j.v.——I4 over a two year period—by
winning theirfirst five of the season,
Lewis‘ Pups certainly came up with a
successful campaign. But it was no
easy task.

For one thing. this year‘s team fuc-
ed a slightly tougher schcdulc than
last year‘s 17-3 squad. The Armyj.v.

was a new addition to the program
and with teams the likes of R.P.I..
Siena, and Albany Business College
to face, this year was to be no
cakewalk. R.P.l. gave the Pups the
most trouble in being the only team
to knock them olftwiccthis season.
Another factor which halted the
l’ups‘ run at the record was the un-
usually large degree of incxpericncc.
Of the 13 players on the team, only
six (less than 50%) were starters on
their high school teams. 'l‘hrcc others
played in school but didn‘t start and
the four remaining Pups never
played high school basketball at all!
Cnttch Lewis was pleased with this
fact in thc light of thc I’up‘s perfor-
mance and felt that it said “a lot for
the accomplishment of thc team.“

Carmcks Verdcjo. one of the four
who never played high school hoop.

No Comparison

Lewis declined to directly oom-
parc this year‘s team with last year's
record scltcrs.arguing that they were
two r' ' ', different teams with
two entirely different styles of play.
“Last year‘s team shot better." he
said. ’and played together better.”
And this year's club? “We ran more
and applied more pressure because
we didn‘t have a great shooting
team.” But that‘s as far as he cared to
pursue the issue. Maybe we'll never
know which scam was actually
better. To Coach Lewis. it only
mattcrs what happens next year
anyway. so why not wait till next
year's team comes along? It‘s all we
have to look forward to!
