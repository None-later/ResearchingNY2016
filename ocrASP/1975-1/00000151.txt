At approximately 7:05 this even-
ing. the Albany State basketball
team will take to the court to battle
the Saints of St. Lawrence Universi«
ty in the opening round‘of the
NCAA playoffs. For the Danes it,
could be the first of a possible five
pressure games on their way to the
Division lll National Cham--
pionship.

The team arrived in Brockport
yesterday and had a light practice in
the evening. “We find a good
workout.“ said Coach Sauers from
Brockport. “We are ready and the
team is sharp.“ Gary Trcvctt echoes
his coach's thoughts. "Wcare ready
to play."

The team saw part of St.
Lawrence‘s practice and Were im-
pressed with them. “We are well
prepared for this ballgame." said
Sauers “Physically we are filtl per
cent the best webavc been sincethc
start of the season."

Albany played in Brockport last
year but has never played in the
Eagles new gym. Some 3.000 fans
from all four universities are ex-
pected to pack the gym for tonight‘s
games.

The Danes 0-7 road record has led
many to discount Albany's chances
in the tournament. but not Doc

don‘t regard the St. Lawrence game
asa road game. it will be played on a
neutral court. We will ltave more
fans than St. Lawrence.“

St. Lawrence will be no pushover.
They bring the second best record
into the tournament. finishing the
season at l9-5. St. Lawrence also has

' “They are a good strong rebounding

Assistant Coach Don Jess and

Former Assistant Coach John Quat-

trocchi have scouted St. Lawrence for
Doc so the team should have a good
idea of what to expect. These two
coaches were particularly impressed
with the Saint‘s star guard. Jimmy
Young. Young will be the man
Albany must stop. if they are to beat
St. Lawrence. He averages in the
lower twenties and has tremendous
accttracy.

The Danes will also have to cort-
tend with (i'5" Tony Ross. Ross led
his conference in rebounding and
could be a big factor in tonight‘s
game. Albany has not yet decided
whether they will play a zone or usea
man-to-inan defense. If Doc goes

Albany is scoring slightly more
points per game than the Saittts
(Kilo-76.5). while the Danes are also
giving up ittorc points (74.9-68.0).
Albany will be at a slight height dis-
advantage. 'f‘hey will be giving away
a total of five inches across the front
line.

The Dane-St. Lawrence game
figures to be a great contest. as both
teams matchtip well. Albany will
have to be considered the favorite, as
most of the crowd will be rontittg for

the effort of the team. “They did a
real good job.“ he remarked and
pointed out that even though their
record was S-lfl-f. five oftbeir losses
were by less than three poirtts. He
also added that in every match.
Albany was forced to forfeit six to
twelve points. To make matters
worse. Albany had to jtigglc their
line-tip. putting people itt higher
weight classes to prevent more
ltit'lcils.

Another problem that was caused

the Danes. Also, they have a coach
who has been around 20 years and
has the best winning percentage of
any active coach in New York State.

f'hc only reason llrockport is

it‘s not going to be easy for
Albany to beat lirockport twice in a
row. especially on the Eagles home

The offices of Student Association
were occupied yesterday afternoon
by about 50 members of EOPSA in
order to protest a proposed budget
cut of $27.000 for l975-76. The black
ETWP had asked for 534.000.

The eight hour long sit-in began
about noon with a steady flow into
the SA office by representatives
from EOI’SA. A confrontation iii.
mospltcre was rcaclted around one
p.in. as the protesters who now filled
the room. demanded a discussion
with SA Comptroller .lerry
Albrecht. Albrecht attempted to
answer various questions pertaining
to SA finance policy but eventually
retreated undcra barrage ofheckling
and personal attack. it was later
reported that Albrecht had subse-
quently submitted his resignation
from the post to be effective March
2|. Dialogue ensued between Cen-
tral Counil Charperson Lew Fidler

and the visitors until SA President

Curranarrivcd.

With Cornin‘s arrival EOPSA
began to submit a series ofdemunds.
including restoration of the $312.50
budget. greater minority representa-
tion in SA and the retraction of a
statement made last Week by Currrm.
Curran agreed use what pwer he had
to satisfy each demand. After
Curran. who httd agreed with EDP-
SA in the first place. signed a state-
ment saying that he would proposca
budget of no less than 537.250 to

that his mind hrtd been chattgcd attd

support. ‘

Ira Bimbitum Vice Pruident SA.
was the only high ofﬁcial who refus-
ed to sign the statement. citing EOP-
SA‘s use of “pressure tactics.“ (Birn-
baum reported that EOPSA had
previously threatened him with an
iinpetichment drive. allegedly
because of his lack of cooperation
with their efforts).

a foam in which allconcemed could
