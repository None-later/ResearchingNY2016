laying in a democracy that's close to 200 years old sounds like an ideal
place‘f'or a free and independent person to make a home. In theory, one can
live a life With all the freedoms and "inalienable rights" associated with such
a country. ' ‘

Yet even today, there are civil rights issues that are not even close to being
resolved, and some of these issues have been around since the whole
democracy began. - '

Students are still treated like little boys and girls, women are still being
treated as women rather than human beings, and native American Indians
are still being treated like foreigners who have no claim to the land.

So maybe our country isn't such a fertile place for freedom after all, as the
articles on pages 4 & 5P seem to indicate.

About the cover:
. Protestors of the late sixties and early seventies who are no longer around
in such great numbers, but perhaps have good reason to be.

he Food Coupon section of

the Welfare Office in

downtown Albany is tucked
away in a remote comer of the first
floor, but it's still not too hard to find.
The place teems with the most unlikely
collection of people to assemble in one
place; old, humble-looking men and
women, young couples with several
scrawny children in tow, students who
somehow manage to disguise their
poverty with genuine leather boots
and animal skin coats, all here to see if
life can be made a little bit ea. 2'

courageous applicant who ventures:
into the confines of Food Stamp land
will be totally ignored by the hali-
dozen harried examiners and the
tyrannical secretary receptionist.
Eventually comes the realization that
one can sit there unnoticed for hours
unless a name is given to the secretary
and an application form is obtained.
Suddenly, some kind of process and
order begins to emerge from the
seeming chaos, and through the
cacaphonous din, remnants of English
dialogue can be discerned.

"Fill out the first two pages only. The
examiner will fill out the rest. Did you
ever receive Food Stamps before?"

"Marian, get the phone, please, not
the first two pages only."

"Good afternoon, Food Stamps. lust
a minute, l'll check. No, no, I'm sorry.
No, you're not entitled to any more.
NO! I've gone over your application,
and that's my decision." SLAM.

Within the next minute all the
phones are ringing again and all the
examiners are ignoring them.

"Robert Frost? ls Robert Frost here?
You're next.”

are giggling rather conspicuously.)

ang. Brnnnng. The phone seems
to be getting louder and more insistent.

Marian, a skinny, thin-tipped, bird-like
examiner, answers it again and the
noise level is down to a mullled roar.

An enormously obese woman with

teased up black hair and no make-up

leans her fleshy elbows on Marian's
desk, waiting tor her to finish the call.

"Now where were we. lerry, you get

here's what you'll be getting, a
hundred-twenty-two a month." The
woman seems relieved.

"Oh! Oh shit, that's better. I thought I
wasgonna hafta pay thafmuch. Whewl
Well, Marian, 1 hope ldon't hafta see
you again too soon. Ha, ha."

"Right, not until luly. Well, take care
of yourself."

Marian gets up from her desk as the
woman leaves, for the first timetooking

worn-out. She glances at the clock and '

shakes her head.

"Oh, no, she left all her stuff here,"
suddenly noticing the lat woman's
documents still lying on her desk.

"Who the hell cares." Jerry, the long-
haired shabbily—dressecl examiner
with the disgusted look on his lace
mutters and slouches by.

"No more applications alter ihree.
Can't you read the sign." The secretary
is addressing a young man who has
begun to clench and unclench his fists.

"But I've been here since before two
o'clock."

"Well, do I have your name and
application form?"

"No, I've got the fomi. Here."

"lt's after three, you'll have to come
back tomorrow. 1 can't take any more
applications today, It's after three."

"But what about all these other
people?"

They gave me their forms before

‘Forget it. O.K.? Forget it. lesusl" He
Walks out shaking his head.

. (intman? Mr. Redmond will see
you now. Sit here but you can't block
the aisle with those chairs."

Mr. Redmond is a distinguished,
benevolent-looking man. His
moustache" bristles at the army
sergeant-ofasecretary and he pulls
three chairs overto his side of the desk.

"Gutman, now let's see. Where's
your record. I'm sorry, I'll be with you
in a second."

He rummages through the files and
comes back empty-handed.

"No records. We'll have to start from
scratch. Do you have your proof of
registration? Rent receipt? Utilities
bill? Any other monthly expenses?
No? O.K., now let's see what your
income is."

He is deluged with letters, bills,
cancelled checks and other
documents and he begins to make his
computations. A Wise guy graduate
student who is still waiting is
determine-d to make his presence
known.

"Hey, it you've got twelve kids and
no income, how much can you get?"

Redmond remains unrulfled. "That
can't happen. You'd be on Public
Asststance, so you :1 have some
income."

The grad student cant leave well
enough alone. 'Ha, can you picture it.
Twelve kids in a supermarket with
tWelve thousand dollars worth of Food
Stamps. Ha, ha, ha.‘

Redmond finally loses his cool. "All
right now, cut it out Will you)" Stop
lutzing with the phone. At this point in
the day, l'iri in no mood for your
nonsense. All that crap about twelve
kids and no income. (Redmond is
turning purple now.) lust finish your
business and get out of here."

The student, grinning idiotically,

shrugs with "w hat-did-l-do-wrong—l'm-
only-trying»to-liven-things-up-a-little"
expression on his face. Redmond is
calming down and finishing his
computations. "Hmm, let's see, a
household of three, with your income,
you'll pay sixty-four dollars for one-
twenty-two every month."

“Sixty-tour?! Last semester we paid
thirty dollars for oneeighteen‘.“

"Are there any expenses you torgot
to tell me about? No? Has your income
changed" Well, I'll check it over, I'm
trying to give you the best deal I can. If
you had fixed bank accounts to report
instead of monthly Social Security
checks, you would probably be
entitled to more, but as itstands, this is
all you're entitled to." He looks
genuinely ruelul.

“No, we know you're not trying to
give us a hard time. ft's just that we
can't understand the discrepancy
between last semester and this
semester. Sixty-four dollars is more
than twice what we were paying.

Redmond looks totally exhausted.
"Marian, when you get a chance,

would you check my math?"

Marian nods and does a quick
check. "books right to me!"

'Well, girls, l'iii sorry, that's it." Once
again the phone interrupts. "Food
Stamps. Can 1 help you? Let me
check." He gets up, flips through some
envelopes on the secretary's desk and
retums with one of them.

"Yes, it's right here. What's your
address now? Oh, yes, well, ll you're
here by ten to tour, It'll be on my desk,
