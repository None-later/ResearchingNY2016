Case Closed

by Curt Koehler(CPS)
our months ago the Justice
Department closed its books
inconclusively on the Kent
State tragedy. Now the agency has
given up on another student
shooting— this time at Southern
University.

The Department, in concluding its
investigation into the fatal shootings of
two students at the predominately
black Louisiana school, said it could
not link specific individuals to specific
violations of federal civil rights laws.

“Sufficient evidence was not
presently available and could not be
developed," the law agency said, "to
determine whether any specific
individual had violated the federal
criminal civil rights statutes." I

The shootings occurred in
November 1972 following an abortive
meeting between students and
Southern President G. Leon Netterville
concerning governance at the
school-— then undergoing class
disruptions and boycotts~ and the
arrest of student leaders earlier that
same day. I

Much confusion has surrounded the
shooting of the two students, Denver
Smith and Leonard Brown.

While accounts of the tragedy
almost universally lack spectficdetails,
they agree on the following scenario.

 

State police and sheriff's deputies were
called by the Southern administration.
In an attempt to disperse students in
Netterville’s office and on the steps
leading to it, the law officers fired tear
gas. Students began to flee the area,
and Smith and Brown fell mortally

wounded from a shotgun blast.

Accounts also agree that the police
officers on the scene carried shotguns

and probably shot the students.

A Special Commission of Inquiry
formed by the Louisiana Attorney
General shortly after the shootings
found that "there was no justification in
law enforcement for them(Smith and

Brown) being shot.“

Yet neither local nor federal grand
iu ries returned indictments
conceming the shootings. The lustice

rights investigation— a type

investigation often pursued when

The l‘lt‘itionnl Student Association

cleCision and said, "If the lustice
Department weren‘t half-hearted
about their investigation they could
figure out who wus responsible" and
"could have eastly developed the

Green said that while Holliday
 violated the trustee's ruling, her refusal
 to honor that policy "did not amount to
i an effective attack on school

produced no adverse effects on the

Holliday praised the American

 would have been "unprofessional" of
 her to have followed the policy set
 down by the trustees. As a child

Wounded Knee Two Years Later...

lndians Sue for ‘90 Million

by Neil Klotz(CPS)
wo years to the day after the
T armed seige of Wounded
Knee began, lawyers for the
Indians involved have filed a $90
million suit against the US military
leaders who authorized and directed
the illegal use of federal troops during
the seige.

The illegal activity of the military first
came to light during the eight month
trial of American Indian Movement
(AIM) leaders conducted in St, Paul
last year.

Early last summer live of the ten
federal charges against AIM leaders
Dennis Banks and Russel Means were
d isrriissed when US District ludge Fred
Nichol ruled that US Army actiVity
during the Wounded Knee occupation
was in violation of the federal laws
i‘ei’tuiring that the President declare a

be used for domestic purposes. Nichol

The new suit by the Wounded Knee
Legal Defense/Offense Committee
cites the same federal law—m the Posse
Commitatus Act prohibiting the
military from enforcing civil law—— as
the basis for the $90 million action.

Among those named in the suit are
former presidential aide Gen.
Alexander Haig; Wayne Colburn,
head of the Special Operations Group
of the US Marshals Service; former
Atty. Gen. Richard Kleindienst, and
Gen. Volney Warner of the 82nd
Airborne Division who clandestinely
directed federal material and
manpower at Wounded Knee,

Meanwhile, on the Pine Ridge
Reservation where the Wounded Knee
confrontation began, more violence
has erupted which has caused the
American Indian Movement to
declare a "national emergency."
