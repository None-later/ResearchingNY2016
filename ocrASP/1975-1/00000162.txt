major lead role. and she handled this
difficult part with surprising case.
This young woman is someone to
watch for in the future: she perhaps
will be one of the university's new
stars.

Excellent. too. was Nelson

performance was at its peak during
the Church scene. He really un-
derstood and delivered his part with
conviction.

The comedy in this tragic story
was beautifully carried offby Louise

Costumes were not as good as I

Designer Daniel Flannery did some

his ideas were surprisingly clever.
Why we can‘t havea liglitingjob like

‘Indian’s’ Violence a Cold, Stark N.Y. Reality

by Hillary D. Kelbick

Entering the Lab Theatre this
weekend one was hit with the cold.
stark reality of a New York City
street. This being in direct contrast
with what was outside the tltctttre
only made the effect more
believable. The simple setting of a
telephone booth (with a genuine
public telephone). a bus stop pole.
and a sidewalk all contributed to
making the Experimental Theatre
production of lsracl Horovitz‘s play
“The Indian Wants the Bronx" ari-
rlfcctiveand relatively shocking per-

formttncc.

The play was directed by liurry

was able to see the sensitivity urt-

rcvercrtcc in r Murpli and his feelings

pressed by lltc actor.

The oventll lack ofinsight into the

actors.

The Indian (Steve ‘l'aubmaiil was
a stereotype vision of a passive

for the performance. He always kept

hours listening to the Indian
language iii the language lab to get a
realistic conception ofthc forciin ac—
cent.

The relationship between Joey
and Murplr wttrincd tip as the play
moved on. They both seemed stiff
arid unnatural in their stance at the
beginning and theirjumpiiig around
was zit first unbelievable; however as
the show continued. the con-
trivctlncss completely left their ac-
tions.

Sound and lighting effects added
to the feeling of New York City at
night. The occasional honking of a
ltorri and the sound ol'acarwhizling
by tnadc trite fch as if lie was viewing
something as it wasactually happen-
ing. Originally. there was 'supposed
to he street lamp pole lighting. but
the experimental theatre budget
didn‘t allow for that luxury.

The joking and horsing around
between the two delinquents turned
sour when it was replaced by the in-
tense and realistic violence. The
scene where .loey. who was always
Murph's subordinate. gained con-
trol and the uppcrhartd. was moving
and even the facial expressions and
movements ofthcactors contributed
to the realistic effect. .loc spinning
Murpli around in circles until the
latter became ill showed the inner-
most feelings ot‘ the more cowardly
taking control. if only for a little
while.

It was no surprise that policemen.
buses. or other passersby did not in-
terrupt the action on the stage. This
in itselfwas typical of late night New
York and further added to the play's
realism. The ﬁnal actions where the
Indian was brutally attacked was
shocking but also believable.

Not very many persons im-
mediately stirred from their seats.
Some were intensely moved.
Although many claimed intense dis-
like tor the play. the mere fact that it
affected and disturbed them is
enough of an indication that “The
Indian Wants the Bronx" was
successful in communicating its ma-
jor goal.
