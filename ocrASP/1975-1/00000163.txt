you go to see an art exhibition rival-

ing those found in manyof New

York's biggest art museums? if you

don‘t have an answer. you should
feel a It e ignorant. Right on cam-
pus. "in'the Fine Arts Building. is

V SUNYA‘s own art gallery.

‘ The Martha Jackson Gallery
Collection. presently on exhibit is
truly. representative of 'some of the
better works of art produced in the
last twently ﬁve years. The collection
is a potpourri of many art forms
from many lesser known artists. as
well as many works by some of the
greatest artists of our time.

No single artist dominates the ex-

. hibit. nor does a speciﬁc art form.
The collection is a mixture of sculp-
ture. oils. photographs. and mixed
media.

= Among the more interesting and
untraditiorfal pieces on exhibit are
the cast lucite sculptures by Dennis
Byng. These sculptures are square
pieces of lucite cast in many colors
and are sure to be the most popular
works in the exhibit. They serve as
excellent examples of the blending of
art and modern technology. and are
representative of the types or art be-
ing pursued by today‘s artists.

newer art fqrrnfsngs ._Cruz Diez‘s

Red Psalm Socialist Fantasy

by M.L. Posters” ' ' "

With good cinemagraphic effort.
“The Red Psalm” lures the viewer
into a rapturous talethat attempts to
depict the stntggie of an oppressed
people: it makes great demands on
the audience‘s ability to sustain a
fantasy. A fantasy whose im-
plications clearly extoli the values of
socialism.

0n Fridayand Saturday night. the
Performing Arts Center presented
“The Red Psalm". a ﬁlm mad in
Hungary with English sub-titles.
There was only a sparse turnout. but
those that attened were thouroughly
doused with the virtues of socialism.

Mikos Jancso directed this yarn
that takes us to the turn oftheTwen-
tieth Century. a time when the
Hungarian country-side lay in tur-
moil. A struggle in response to a
repressive government. The peasan-
try (working class) is tired of
bourgeoisie exploitation and proud~
ly proclaim their allegiance to the
new Socialist Workers‘ PARTY]

Throughout the ﬁlm the vieWer is
acquainted with customs and rituals
of the peasantry. and also given
more than subtle allusions to the
grandeur of socialism: tables of food
where people share. and by sharing
become one. one in purpose. united
in an apparentlyun-dying cause . It
reeks ofsocialism to the point where
you wonder about its intentions:
dramatic entertainment and pure
propoganda‘! Undoubtedly both.

True to the title's implication. the
peasantry or working class dances
and sings songs of freedom. of all
some day beneﬁtling from their toil.

‘_ Froaen Lake High in the
Wilderness.” It is merely a piece of
acrylic molded in the shape of gently
sloping mountains with a small rou-
nd piece of blue‘green glass in the
middle representing a lake surround-'
ed by snoweovered mountains. It is
a very simpleand beautiful work and
is'the eye catcher of the exhibit. r

Many more well known artists
also have works on exhibit among
them Calder. Fred Brooms and
Louise Nevelson. f‘Petite Araignee
Blanche” is a small black and white
mobile. and is highly representative
of Calder's unique ability to put
dynamic movement into art. Fred
Brooms. the satirist of the modern
art form has his work the
“Policewoman” on display. Anyone
who grew up in a city will have this
wooden sculpture remind them of
that big nice lady who used to take
you across the street.

If you have ever been to the
Museum of Modern Art in New
York. you should immediater
recognize Louise Nevelson's
modiﬁed version of “Skyehapel” on
exhibit here. It is a big narrow
wooden box ﬁlled with a complex
assortment of objects all painted
charcoal black.

Also on exhibit are some excellent
photographs by Tod Bryant. who
seems to capture the mood of the
Seventies along with some of the
vestiges of the Sixties in his works.

script. and with dialogue like: “A
socialist keeps an open mind and is
willing to debate. A reasonable
socialist is not destntctive.“ No one
can question his political
preferences.

 

 

‘ own 8  ‘iioo -

by Elizabeth Masearl

A centenary recital of the piano
music of Maurice Ravel, French im-
pressionist composer. was held on
March 7. l975'—exaetly one hun-
dred years after his birth. Six
pianists from the area. two of which
(Findlay Cockrell and Paula Ennis)
are faculty members of SUNYA‘s'
music department. performed a wide
selection of Ravel's music for the
piano. composed from the year Is”
to l9l7.

Held in Page Hall on the down-
town campus, the recital attracted a
good size audience from all facets of
the Albany area. As we congregated
to the “key side” of the concert hall.
the renowned Findlay Cockrell
opened the program with “Pavane
for a Dead Princess.“ a relatively
short. somber piece which is usually
performed in its transcribed form
(for orchestra).

Following this piece. Mr. Cockrell
gave: a short. informal speech about
the "Pavane." in addition to
emphasizing the two types of music
written by Ravel: Neoclassic and im-
pressionistic. From this point on. the
recital was conducted on an informal
basis.

Ms. Judith Esch. a Schenectady
resident. performed next. and quite
well. the beautiful "Jeun d‘Eau
(Water Games). a typically Im-
pressionistic. flowing piece. Ms.
Charlotte deBlois. another area resi-
dent. played two movements of the

With symbolic red banners. the
peasantry unites in attempts to sub-
vert capitalist monsters. It is indeed a
tale that makes a clear dichotomy:
you‘re either good or bad—no in
betweens; like a John Wayne movie,
you‘re with him or against him.

Neoclassic “Sonatine.” Both 
have studied piano seriously but are

.not active in the ﬁeld now. I felt the

uneasiness of both on stage as corn-
pared to Mr. Cockrell and Ms. En~
nis. who are in the habit of giving fre-
quent recitals and concerts. Cockrell
completed the Sonatine with its third
movement.

There were two intermissions to
this three hour recital At the ﬁrst.
Findlay. clearly playing the role of
Master of Ceremonies by now. pass-
ed around some piano scores of the
music performed during the course
of the evening. Also. with the use of
shrewd humor. he asked for con-
tributions to support the movement
of the piano from the floor to the
stage prior to the concert. His cam-
paign was successful.

*

in the second section of the
program. Paula Ennis performed
“Miroirs,” (Reflections) a group of
five impressionistic pieces, and
provided some background infor-
mation on them. As always. Ms. En-
nis. intensely involved in the music
herself. convinced the audience of
the images she presented and receiv-
ed a standing ovation for her
brilliant performance. Next on the
program. but not anticlimactic. was
"Gaspard de la Nuit.“ another great
impressionistic work. in three
movements played by Ms. Juana
Zayas-Fromageot. The Cuban
pianist portrayed. with excellent
technique. a great feel for theexpres-
sion of Ravel‘s contrasting images
and emotions. Overall. she gave an
impressive and magnificent perfor-
mance.

The recital, although well done in

‘total. wasa bit too long. A good

percentage of the audience left after

‘the second intermission. At this

point. Cockrell opened the third sec-
tion of the program with. “Minuet
on the name of HAYDN." short.
sweet. and complete with explana-
tion into the analysis of the theme.
Mr. William Jones. a faculty
member at Holy Name. presented
well. “Valses nobles et sentimen-

'tales." a series of waltzes in the style

of Schubert. yet retaining that con-
temporary French flavor. Com—
posed. yet quite musical. Mr. Jones‘
exhibition was professional.

as

Mr. Cockrell closed the program
with “Le Tombeau de couperin.“ in
six movements. This piece. full of
distince rhythmic patterns. was
written at thetirne ofthe First World
War. The diverse movements. as
Cockrell pointed out. are tributes to
the memory of several of Ravel‘s
friends. Once again. the pitmist‘s
superb technique shone. He sur-
prised the audience by playing a pre-
recorded version (By Cockrell
himself) oftheiastmovement.an ex-
tremely technically difficult piece.
Although Cockrell did not explain
his reason for taking this action. he
did apologize for using the scores.
during all of his performances. The
excuse given was that he had been
running around. organizing and
preparing this recital. and therefore
had little time to practice.

All right. Findlay Cockrell. we
rocognize you for your dedication.
and once again. we thank vou.
Maurice Ravel. we also thank you.

Queen Gives Mason Heart Attack

by Spencer Rants)
and Matt Kaufman

Sheer Heart Attack - Queen. after
having the honor (along with Mott
the Iioople) of being the ﬁrst rock
group to play Broadway. has follow—
ed up not with a live album. as did
Mott. but with their third studio
release. This is their most
professional. most satisfying. most
commercial effort to date. They're
still doing a lot of the same hard-
hitting. pile-driving rock. dressed up
by the characteristic vocal ex-
travaganlas of Freddie Mercury.
with just a few concessions that will.
hopefully. propel them in the direc-
tion of AM radio and the Top Ten.

Side one is the Queen of old. only
maturity is slowly creeping into their
work. Abrupt tempo changes. echo
and phasing effects are all employed
quite successfully and with quite in-
teresting results. The longer tnusiatl
excursions of the first two Queen
albums have been discarded (and let
us hope. only temporarily) for
shorter three minute melodies that
have a better chance at the hit
market.

the second side is a little disap-
pointing; they try to do something
with "In lhc Lap Of The Gods".
beginning and ending the side with
it. but it doesn't come off very well.
l'hcte‘s also an absolutely oh-
noxious song entitled "firing Hack

That Leroy Brown'that is. if such a

thing is possible. even more ot'anex-
ploitative piece of trash than all the
"Best Of“ Jim Croce albums that
have sprouted up since his death.

Sheer Ham Arradr may sound
like a very familiaralbum cvenwhen
played for the ﬁrst time; choruses.
leads. rhythms and efTects will all
seem vaguely like something you‘ve
already heard before. The simplcex-
planation is that Queen borrows
quite freely and liberally from other
groups and songs. the most alsin
recognizable bits being from the
Beatles and Bad Company.

Nothing wrong in that. though. its
been done by almost everyone from
Elton John to Alice Cooper. whose
deul's Out album is an almost
completely non-original composite
of other people‘s work. It‘sa sure way
of making the listener feel at 
with a new song. and ofcourse isjust
one more helping hand on theway to
creating a hit single.

Dave Mason - Dave Mason

Dave Mason spent several years
recording and touring after the
release of his hit solo album Alone-
‘l'agctlu'r. Since that time. Mason
produced a few repetitious records
repetitious in the scnsetlsathis songs
were very similar—sounding. to the
point where some were actual re-
rccordings of old tunes.

Net-er Left in I913. Mason began to
crlc more successful songs. ap-
proaching the quality of those on his
ﬁrst album. Dave Mason. his latest
effort. could be considered his best
album since Alone—Together. The
songs are deﬁnitely characteristic of
Dave Mason. but the “I‘ve heard this
song before“ feeling is not apparent.
0f the nine songm‘ﬁve are Mason
originals. dnh it‘littﬁévision of an
earlier song (“Every 'Woman"). and
three were written by others. The
Mason and Company version of
Dylan's‘AII Along the Watchtower“
is especially interest'ings- it presents
an excellent blend of the styles of
guitarists Dave Mason and Jim
Krueger. For several years this has
been one of Mason's favorite pieces
in concert. The song is performed in
a very hard style.a|most comparable
to Hendrix. The final song on the
album. 'You Can‘t Take It With
You“ is deﬁnitely a standout. As
with every song on the album. the
vocals (Mason) are superb and the
hand is tight.

An iriten'ie-wcr once asked Eric
Clapton about the possibilities of
playing with Dave Mason. Clapton
answered. "He should go out to
America. and do a tour in his own
name...until he‘s really got sulllt.‘
kind of recognition he dcscncs as a
solo artist." Alter scteral years of
working his balls ot'ftouring. Mason
has shown a definite consistency and
confidence in his music. On stage.
Mason glws off an aura of con-
lidcncc and expertise. of content-
ment with his nork: ultimately
presenting the audicncc with a
satisfying musical experience. You
