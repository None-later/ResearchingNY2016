attempt to establish a continuous,
recycling program on the SUNYA
campus. .

“Brewersare not the big, bad guys”

environmentalists, make us out to

' be." said Glenn Grift‘o. Albany area

manager for Miller Brewing Corn-
pany. “Canners‘and bottlersare run-
ning into tremendous resistance
from environmentalists who want

ideal solutions. We‘re trying to find"

feasible methods of cleaning up the
environment.“

While beverage containers ac-
count for only 20% of the total
volume of litter. less than 2% of this
waste is recycled. Instead. beverage
container waste goes into open
dumps. sanitary la ndlills. in-
cinerators and sewer systems. These
disposal methods create their own
environmental problems. Open
dumps breed. germs.‘ insects and
disease—carrying rodents as well as
pose fire harards. Landfills. even
when properly handled. can emit
methane gas as well as pollute the
underlying water.

“We're trying to find an alter-
native solution to disposing of can
and bottle litter through our recycl-
ing program.“ (iriffo said. The Pick-
Em-Up contest. which started in the
spring of I97] on the campuses of
Louisiana State University, Florida
University and the University of
Rhode Island. is an ecology drive iii-
tended to get campus groups to
collect beverage container litter for
recycling. The program is being run
by the Miller Reclamation Com-
pany. a subsidiary of the Miller
Brewing Company. Presently, full
year reclamation programs operate
on eighty college campuses
throughout the United States.

While onlyMillerproduets will be
counted in the contest, Miller Brew-
ing Company will collect all other

said. 4 V

The Pick-Em-up contest will
become a year-round recycling
program at the end of the contest
period, March |9th to May 7th.
Cans and bottles collected by cam-
pus groups will be picked up weekly
'by the local Millerdistributor. From
the campus, the beverage container
litter will be sent to Reynolds
Aluminum. Alcoa and various glass
manufacturers for recycling treat-
ment. v

“The program is not a drinking

contest but a serious ecology drive
intended to clean up the environ-
ment," said Griffo. “We‘re not look-
ing to fool the public. We‘re es-
tablishing a program that will
benefit the campus and the com-
munity as well as ourselves.“ he add-
ed.

“It‘s a compromise,“ agreed Rick
Sabilia. a SUNYA studentand cam-
pus represcntatiVe of the Miller
Reclamation program. “Big business
is trying to help out without strangl-
ing themselves. We‘re trying to com-
bine economic welfare and en-
vironmentul welfare."

Environmentalists‘ criticism of
waste-producing industries is often
unjustified according to Woody Eu-

marketing department of the
Milwaukee-based Miller Brewing
Company. “Our glass bottles have

Remember thore wonderful
days when there was time to
settle buck and enjoy a long,
peaceful loo/e at the world?

Come back to those days. You’ll
ﬁnd them at Ten Broeck Manor.
Here are apartments in the
country style. Serene simplicity
and warm textures all around
you. Sunlight stream: into your
lofted living room. And below
your window lies the Valley of
the Hudson.

Ten Broeck Manor was con-
ceived around a basic idea: One
of lifels greatest pleasures is to
relax and enjoy a beautiful view
from a quiet place that is your
own borne.

It’s like living in the country
with the city next door.

less energy and expense to have
bottles recycled than to make and
reuse aluminum cans, she said.

“It would bemore beneﬁcial in the
long run if students lobbied to get the
bottle bill passed.“ Jackson said.
The bottle bill, presently on file in
the New York State Assembly and
Senate. proposes mandatory
deposits on all beer and soft-drink
cans and bottles. The bill. if passed,
would require beverage companies
to use containers of uniform design
for reuse by more than one beverage

Jackson believes it is unrealistic to
expect students to save up a bag of
cans for future collection. Instead,
people will continue to pollttlc the
environment with these noti-
degradablc cans. she said. Salbiliii.
campus representative for the Miller
program, feels that strong student
and community involvement in the
recycling drive would cut down on
aluminum can litter. “The question
whether a can is bio-degradable
wouldn't bean issue ifpcoplepickcd

to meet the environmentalists hall
way. You have to start somewhere."

R00m_ Food Prices Lowest

by Susan Michael

One of the demands students have
presented to the F.S.A.. which is
responsible for all food service
(among other things) on campus, is
that prices at the I’atroon Room (on
the second floor of the Campus
Center) be raised to prices of com-
parable cstablishmcnts in thearea or
that services be reduced so that
l’atl'oon Room is able to break even
on its own. The prices given on the

following table are taken from the
menus of those establishments. The
table cannot say anything about ser-
vice or atmosphere. and although
the writer has never eaten at any of
them. the Patroon Room is a very
pleasant place and the service is sup-
posed to be quiet good. Lum‘s and
l’latt's l’lacc are on Wolf Road in
Albany. Lerner's and Howard John-

‘ son‘s are in theStuyvesant Shopping

Plaza on Fuller Road.

Chattering Chimpanzees

(ZNS) Planet of the Apes may be

'I‘wo baby chimpanzees. each
placed in the homes ol‘u deal" couple
and raised from birth alongside the
couple‘s own infants. are reported to
be learning sign language as quickly
as the human babies do.

According to two University of
Nevada Psychologists, Doctors
Allen and Beatrice Gardner, the two
chimps were each placed in the
homes of a deaf couple who coin-
municalcd with their babies only
through sign language.

The Gardners found that both the
human and chimpanzee infants
began making signs such as "come"
or "gimme" at the age of three
months, whereas most human babies
won't utter tht first word until they
are about one year old.

Jabbering Chimps

'l‘he Gardners report that after six
months, the baby chimps were
jabbcring away with their fingers at
the human infants much faster than
other chimps had learned to com-
municate in sign language with
humans before.
