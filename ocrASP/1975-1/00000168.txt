Tranquilli says. however, that Uncle
Sam hasn't a chance of getting the
back tax money.

The anti-war activist says she gave
all of her tax money away to poor

have it impounded by the Govem-

She repons she is now living on

Asked what she did in prison,
Tranquilli said. among other things,

V she had a high school course in

MANSLAUGHTER

(ZNS) A pedestrian in Scotland
was sentenced to jail this week on
charges that be literally frightened
another man to death.

The pedestrian. John Taylor.
pleaded guilty to charges of making
threatening behavior toward a 65—
year-old motorist Andrew Davis.

The incident occurred when
Taylor stepped out in front of
Davis‘s car last September and the
car came to a screeching halt, barely
missing Taylor.

Taylor apparently became enrag-
ed at this. He opened the car door.
dragged Davis out. struggled with
him and then tried to let the air out of
the car's tires.

Davis. shocked by what was
happening. suffered a heart attack
and died on the spot.

PELVIS’S PLANE

(ZNS) Elvis Presley is probably
regretting the day he got involved
with Robert Vesco.

it all started when Elvis made a
down payment on a lavish 707 jet
once owned by the fugitive financier.
The $l.5 million plane includes two
dance ﬂoors. a sauna bath and two
large privnic bedrooms.

The Pelvis was ready to claim the
jet when he received a worning from
one of Vesco‘s companies. The
Panama-based firm warned Elvis
that ifhc bought the plane. and then
landed anywhere outside the United
States. Vesco would have it seized.

This was enough for Elvis; he
quickly backed out of the deal.

This week, however, Elvis got
more bad news. He learned that the
American firm which claims to own
the jet. Fairchild General. has filed
suit against him. The suitclnims that
Elvis backed out of the deal too late.
and that he must now come through
with the money for the jet.

GENITALIA SCULPTOR

(ZNS) A New York artist. Doug
Johns. is probably one of the most
unique protrait specialists you‘ll ever
run across.

Johns specializes in turning out
exact but enlarged replicas of in-
dividualgenitalia.Johnsrcportsthat
nearly 200 men and women have
already posed for him, and that he
has cast perfect likenesses of their
organs. .

Johns is collecting the replicas for
a show he plans someday. He
rewards'each model with the ﬁrst
cast of his or her organ.

Johns says that after gazing
carefully utgenitalia foryears,he has
found that they are far more unique
than faces or even tingcrprints.

When a chest x-ray shows that you have a
potential killer like TB or cancer, it’s not a pretty
picture. But it's an important picture because it
can .help the doctor detect and catch the killer
in time.

When doctors are out to catch these poten-
tial killers. they want the sharpest. clearest x-ray
films they can get. And that's why people at
Kodak spend so many hours creating new and

Council Backs  toot  

by Brent Kluter ‘

With a rare display of unity. Cen-
tral Council voted Wednesday night
to uphold Pat Curran‘s veto of the
$35,650 EOPSA budget that had
been passed by Council in a
tumultuous session two nights.
before. Other action in the unusually
short. 75-minute meeting included
passage of a resolution of support
for the demands of CAUSE (a/k/a
the Student (1 .cvance Group) and
the granting of n supplemental ap-
propriation to le Cercle Francois. A
multisponsored bill calling for the
dissolution of the Student Associa-
tion government was withdrawn by
its introduccrs.

Art undcbatcd 26-l decision"
with faculty member Ralph Beislcr
casting the only negative vote——
demonstrated Council‘s endorse-
ment of Curran‘s strongly-worded
veto statement. The message. which
combined a written memorandum
with a short address. Couhcil
Chairperson Lew Fidler‘s opening
warning that Itarrassment would no
longer be tolerated at Council
meetings. “Monday night was tltc

last lilllt': the last time Central Coun-
cil will be ruilrondcd into a decision;
the last time Student Association
will yield to inflammatory ntoh
rule . . . “ began Curran's state-
ment. The SA President went on to
denounce intimidation through the
use of “personal insults“ and
“charges of racism“ as well as by
physical threat or action.

Curran‘s declarations "referwto
Monday‘s emergency Council
meeting. in which EOPSA members

barricaded the doors of the Campus
Center Assembly Hall, refusing exit
'to Councilmembers unless the E0?-
SA demands were met. By contrast.
Wednesday's meeting, which was
held in the Campus Center cafeteria
to accommodate an expected crowd
spectators. was unusually placid.

Council‘s approval of Curran‘s
veto has the effect of turning the
clock back to last Sunday. when
Budget Committee recommended
that the l975-7h EOI’SA allocation
bc $7000. some 530.000 less than re-
quested lt is expected that the EOP-
SA hudgctwillcome up forapproval
in April along with those ofthc other
SA groups.

The events of the past week have
had widespread effects within SA.
Half of Budge. Committee. in-
cluding chairperson Mark Golds-
tcin. have submitted resignationsand
several members of Central Council
reportedly may follow them. More
importantly. officers of SA and
EOI’SA have been persuaded to
schedtrlc a series of meetings among
themselves and members of faculty
and administration to work out the
differences between the two groups.
Optimism can be seen in EOI’SA
President Fred Stokelin‘s declara-
tion of cooperation from his group
and faith that problctns in thc
budgctting process can be solved
through interaction.

Due to the amount of time that
