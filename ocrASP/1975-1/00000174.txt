; Attempt

by Dave Gslletly

Oil politics aside, the US. Congress has not
lost its touch for international crisis
management. The latest casein point being the
call for the ouster of the Lon Nol government
in Cambodia. In a rare show of unity Senate
De mocratic, Leader Mike Mansfield
(Montana) was joined by Republican Leader
Hugh Scott (Pennsylvania) in calling for Lon
Nol‘s‘departure as the best hope for peace in
that troubled Southeast Asian nation.

Scott stressed that he was speaking only for
himself and not for the Administration who is
seeking an immediate $222 million emergency
appropriation to bail out the Cambodian
government until the start of the rainy season
in June. The Ford request has fallen short this
week as a compromise SI25 million was
reported out of a Senate subcommittee for
military aid.

The problem is that the government might
fall beforeany aid could get to it.And therein is
the complex rationale for granting aid in the
ﬁrst place. ’

Defense Secretary James Schlesinger is
keeping up his public relations campaign for
the Cambodians. being quoted early this week
saying such'encouragihg thing'sas “The fall of
Phnom Penh is not liirminent." though the
airport. the only lifeline for the capital. was
again closed by rocket ﬁre as late asTuesday.

The scenario ﬂoating around the balls of
Congress Iater goes something like this:

G rant aid to the faltering Lon Nol government ‘

spent. ss it is shady to late to save that
floundering nation. Thus, We get the best of
both worlds. we support an ally during a
period of severe difﬁculty and get the cash sent
over there back when Cambodia fallsi

Of course if this was asked of an American
ofﬁcial all you would get is a flat denial since
the~plan must be kept secret to work. If our
friends knew this would be only a futile
gesture. the whole plan would backfire. So the
pretense of a militarily viable Cambodian
defense has to be kept by all parties involved
for the next few weeks. ~ '

To the end of helping persuade the
Congress. Lon Nol has ﬁred his top general
and announced major cabinet changes. This
will only partly help however as the
Cambodian milifary. will no doubt retain its

corrupt image. The bulk of American relief I

shipments have gone to the army and not to
the majority of the starving populace. Those
who can pay the steep black market prices eat

. those who can‘t. don‘t. It‘s that simple.

The Senate has attempted to put some
strings on any continued aid, by passing a
resolution. without dissent. asking the Ford
administration to assure that half the rice
shipped to Cambodia be made available for
free. humanitarian distribution. '

The distribution resolution was sponsored
by Sen. Mark Hatﬁeld (R-Oregon) who was
praised by Mansﬁeld adding his feeling that
peace in Cambodia would be “a distant
mirage" if the Ford plan was passed.

So we can probably predict three things for
the next few weeks in the debate and final
action on the Cambodian crisis. First. the
Congress will take some action on a watered
down appropriation to aid Lon Nol (or a
possible new leader). This will try to satisfy all
partiits in Washington that We have taken care
of our obligations. Second. assisted or not
Phnom Penh will most likely fall by June with
unknown consequences for it's residents and
the rest of Southeast Asia. And third, the
people ofCumbodia will come up on the short
end ofthe stick becauseof U .8. foreign policy.

The events spanning the past few days involving the budget cut of EOPSA by the SA
Budget Committee have left bad feelings in the hearts and minds of a number of people.
Understandably. feelings cannot be eradicated overnight. However, a genuine effort to
work toward meaningful solutions may be a starting point. We of SA and EOPSA are.

We have recognized the inherent shortcomings within the present student government
system. These areas are: (l ) the budgetary process, and (2) lack of adequate representation
on Central Council. We view these as crucial to not only the evenfs leading up till now. but
also to the continuation of student-controlled activities here at SUNYA.

We of SA and EOPSA are committed to the restructuring of both our structures to
accommodate our varied needs and insure active participation of all sectors of the student

rational solutions to our present situation.

This past week. the bad news from the
Environmental Protection Agency was
postponementofyct another phase ofthe I970
Clean Air Act's auto emission levels. From
Washington. the head ofEPA, Russell Train.
actually called fora slowdown in the drive to
improve emission standards. With
Congressional authorization. EPA is granting
the automakers a one year extension to attain
the standards thatwereoriginnliy set for I975.
model cars. Thecxtra year covers 1977 its well.
giving automakers until I978 to improve the
emission controls present on cars noiv'! ‘

These long range plans for cleaning up the
automobile are somewhat in accord with
President Ford‘s proposal to place a freeze on
emission standards from I977 to I981.
Although both are weak. Ford‘s proposal
would at least bean improvement over ’I‘ruin‘s
because it requires a higher degree of
proficiency to be obtained before the freeze
takes affect. As of this writing the President
has instructed Train to announce the EPA
proposal. but has not yet approved it.

To reduce air pollution controls of any form
is to deal a tremendous setback to our
environment. In the automobile industry.
models and their parts are stocked for ten
years before being phased out. lfin this year of
I975. cars were being produced with faultless
emission control. it still would not be until
I984 that most cars on the road had them!
Obviously reducing emission standards in any
year is talking a huge step backward; one that
we can hardly afford.

But what is the rationale behind lil’A‘s
abrupt announcement?'l‘rttiu places the blame
on the catalytic converter. no anti-pollution
dcvicc his agency forced on the industry in
I973. Developed by (iencral Motors. a
catalytic converter is basically a bed of
ceramic beads with a catalyst (i.e.
platinum/pnlndium) through which the
exhaust posses. thus promoting the
conversion of carbon monoxide and
hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide-and water.

Suddenly. the word from EPA is that
catalytic converters on new cars may be doing
mo re harm than good because of thcsulphuric
ttcid produced during the process.

Tl‘tlln admitted just this past week. that
EPA has known about the problem since
February ‘73 but didn‘t consider it a serious
one! Ilut now that it is a "serious" problem
Train says that he docsn‘twish to increase the
use of converters in the future. thus the need
for less strigcnt emission levels. All this leads
me to wonder what the real reason is behind
relaxed auto emission standards.

The automobile industry. backbone of the ‘
American economy. suffered some severe
setbacks last year. Chrysler Corporation lost
$52 million and earnings at GM dropped by
60%. The profits at Ford likewise fell 60%,
compared with a dip of 84% at American
Motors. All in all. what a year!

Things are bad all over and obviously the
govemment is trying to help. but are we sure
this is the best answer‘IOncc again. I‘m afraid
wc‘rc left wondering: what will be the real
price and how long before we find out?
