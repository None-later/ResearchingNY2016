“So. what‘s going on at this cam-
pus'!“ asked Alfred Rollins. who yes-
tcrday becatiie the second Presiden-
tial candidate to make an appearanc
at SUNYA. under the protective
shroud of the Search Committee.
"What are llte issues?"

Dressed iii a maroon blazer attd
\il'ipcd shirt. with tan douhlckitit
pants and a matching tic. Rollins
leaned forward frequently as he
\[HlirC. his forehead wrinkling while
he responded to and posed
question during the early morning
meeting with students.

“1 would Iikcto be President it‘s
a lot of fun." ltc said jokingly. though
he insisted he is “not seeking“ the
job. rather lie is allowing himself to
he considered for it. Currently fix-
ccritive Vice President at llieUniversi-
ly of Vermont. Rollins expressed the
feeling that it is time for him to move
on; “it‘s an administrative cycle.
After a while you get tobccrtnc part
of tire problctii instead of the solit-
ttoii. l‘ve inert titerc as lotig as i
should." he said. adding. “1 do not
want to stay oit to the poitrt where l'll
be an cmharrassiiiciit.“

His voice is low and airy. llis dark
hair is sprinkled only lightly with
gray. a fact that would tend to belie
his 53 years if not for the flabby cltin
and receding hairline.

“The top priority is teaching“ said
Rollins. when asked what he feels the

main goals of a University Center
should be. “it‘s something everyone
in the University must do.“

At least partially explaining this
view may he th fact that Rollins has
spent most of his 26-year academic
jrccr as a teacher. For 15 years he
tatrglit History at SUNY New l’altz,
later moving on to Binghamton.
where he eventually became chair-
man of the History Department. In
1907 he left the SUNY s)” cm to
accept his position at the University
of Vcrntonl. which he describes as
being relatively small compared to
SUNYA.

Rollins outlined what ltc called
"two distiitct lines of communica-
tion."()iicistlicadministrativekitid.
and the other is the more informal
type. “i think a good deal of the
i’rcsidcnt‘s time should be spent
developing that other litre of com—
tnrinication.“ he said. emphasizing
tiic need for a sense of community.
“One of the biggest problems here is
that the University is catight up in it
great amount of bureaucratic
process.“ Rollins repeatedly ex-
pressed a desire to avoid “mass
production of students.“

Rollins feels that a Univct 'ty'
Center must serve local as well as
national needs. Accordingly. he
says. a university President should
spend 50'}; of his time on campus
and 5004' off. “though. iit one sense.

program that he thinks Will help
develop important ties to the local

"Faculty and students are iii-
ti'acted to a University for very sub-
tic reasons," said Rollins. A faculty
that brings nationitl atteittiort to a
