The 1975 Lacrosse season opens
for the Great Dames April 9 and
both coach Dave Armstrongand the
team are eagerly awaiting.

The team will be out to improve
upon last seasons mark with a year
of experience under their belt.
Although only 4-7 last year. “the
record is deceiving says Dane coach
Armstrong. Four of those games we
lost by one goal. In addition our
other losses were at the hands of the
top three teams in the ECAC Tour-
nament last year. namely Genesco.
RH". and Hartwick."

Armstrong. who played his
college Lacrosse for Ball State.
where he was captain all four years
while playing goalie. is very op-
timistic. With l9 returning veterans.
indeed he should be.

Starters back from last year in—
clude leading scorers Steve Schaus
and Pete Connor. Both Pete and
Steve will be at the midfield spot and
will most likely be joined by Arnie
\VillorDennis Walsh.Thcthingthat
Armstrong is most pleased about is
the number of peoplcavnilahle to fill
the midfield slot. Right now says
Armstrong. "I'd like to and I think

  
    

NCAA and NIT Champions.

“It's about time we got this natural
rivalry going.” said Sauers. “And
with state-wide radio and television
edverage a strong possibility, the
non-scholarship athletes of both
Conferences will get some much
needed,,publicity." I

“We hope to make this an annual
affair." said Tournament Director
David Halberstram. “Right now
there is very little in the way ofinter-
conference play or rivalry. and we
hope to change that in the nest few
years."

Robots. Koola selected

lid Robota of (icttcsco State is ex-
pected to lead the SUNY All Star
Player list. Albany State‘s lone
senior l’ete Koola was also among
those selected from the 22 SUNY
candidates.

Preview

I'll be able to rttn four lines of mid-
lieldcrs."

The attack shapes up in this
manner. Speedy sophomore Terry
llrndy from Holy Trinity High
School (l..l.) will play behind. The
second attack spot right now belongs
to freshman Danny Coggin. “Danny
is very quick and posses an excellent
shot." The third spot as ofnow is up
for grabs. Those in contention for
the position Larry Robinowicz.
Kevin Hilly. and Bob Williams. all
sophomores.

The defense. which Armstrong
considers the key to success. will be
anchored by junior dcl‘enscman liill
.Ionat. “Jonat. a big 6'3“ 200
pounder. is quick and has an ex-
ccllcnt stick. Because of this he will
cover the other teams' top scorer.“
Joe Mullen. who Armstrong refers
to as “big. mean and nasty.“ has the
second spot and both Dave Ahonen
and Kevin Murphy will battle for the
third and final spot.

In the nets Albany will have either
returning gotilic llob Wulkiewicy.
Kenny Alvcrson. a freshman from
New Hyde Park or Frank Villtinova.

A. M. I. A. Adopts New Policies

The Association of Men's lit-
tramural Athletics (A.M.l.A.)
Council recently adopted and for-
malized a set of policies involving
such matters as :cligibility. schedul-
ing of events. figltting penalties.
bond money. roster. etc.

“We felt that it was time to re-state
our many bylaws and rules.“ said
A.M.l.A. President David M. Colin.
"We have heard too many protests
and complaints regarding matters
which are stated at meetings. but
niis-understotnl. Now. everything
will be in writing. nnd the teant

 

   

  

representative at the meeting will be
required to sign a statement
acknowledging that lie/she has read
our policy and eligibility rule
sheets."

“We have experienced agreat deal
of trouble regarding postponement
of games." said Nolan Altman.
chairman of the A.M.l.A. Ad Hock
Committee on Rules and Policies.
"Our new policy statement makes it
clear that postponements must be
made at least 48 hours in advance of
the scheduled game. that the team
seeking the postponement must coit-

tact the other team involved and ob-'

thin that tcums‘ agreement. that the
postponing tennis must find two
teams to play in the timc~slol they
are vacating. and that all four in-
volved captains must individually
contact tltc A.M.l.A. Office at least
48 hours in advance of the scheduled
game to announce their agreement

to postpone.‘
Fighting Rule

“Unfortunately. we occasionally
face the problem of fights in
A.M.l.A. activities.“ sttid Mark
Wecltsler. eo-chairmttn of the ad hoc
committee. “In the past. the Council
has ncvcrhad a definite lighting rule.
Now. new rulesspecificttlly state that
any player who fights with another
player shall be suspended on the
spot. and must appear at the next

A.M.l.A. Council meeting. if it is a
first offense. his/her name must he
placed on the new fighting list. and
he/she may be suspended at the dis-
cretion of the Council. Second
offenders shall automatically be
suspended fora period to be deter-
mined by the Council. Once a name
is placed on the figlttinglist.it will re-
main tlterc for the remainder of the
ligliter‘s stay at the university."

“Anyone who fights with an
A.M.l.A. Official or Student Assis-
tant on duty shall immediately be
suspended. must appear at the next
Council meeting. and must be
suspended for a period to be deter-
mined hy the Council.“

” Matty people come to us in»
uniting about bond money." said
A.M.l.A. 'l rcnsuter Nat Snlnul.
“and now it is explained to tillon it
set policy lornt. llnsicnlly. A.M.l.A.
tesencs the right to collect liontl
ntoncy lot any events tltc Council
deems it necessary for. Such money
must ht: deposited in our SA ac—
count. lts purpose is to gunrnntcc
that tennis do not forfeit. as lortcits
cause scheduling problems and
usually ruilt leagues.

Currently. we are forced to keep
$2 oitt of every S lo we collect. as per
SA requirements in our budget."

signing rosters has been our major
