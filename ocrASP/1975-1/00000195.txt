Remember as children the building
blocks you loved? Do you remember the
Leggo sets? The even hopscotch boxes?
Do you remember the pleasure derived
from square game boards? Or when
Mommy neared the room?

Symmetry. At Concrete Gardens you
can return to the symmetry o/‘your youth.

Here are apartments you can share with
people your own age, in an environment
of beautiful sameness. Serene simplicity
of living space means a delightful sense of
organized beauty. Out your window you
can see angular sunlight and even
shadows.

It's like living in a Geometry textbook.

“Tired of Apothehy

To the Editor:

' Resenting all‘ the abuse that upthctic
dents receive on this campus. we ahve
rmed the Albany Apathy Slub.
The purpose of the club is to stand up for the
athetic student's rights here atSUNYA. It is

all too often that we are the brunt for ruthless

.attacks in the press. and we are repeatedly

blamed for the condition of the atmosphere of
the school. We're tired of this treatment!

When you think about it. it‘s kind of
incredible. Here at Albany. where we always
heat ltow the majority of students are
apathetic. there is not one cent of student tax
monies spent on apathetic programming. We
plan to change all that.

Students lorupathy will mayhave a meeting
in LC —7 next Tuesday at 7:30. Then again. we
may not. Idon‘t really care.

Stop It!

To the Editor:

I want to complain about all the
complaining that‘s going on. Why is everyone
complaining? It's so stupid to complain. and
Very annoying. People are cotnplaining about
their courses. about the food. about their girl
and boy kricnds. about their parents and
about stupid cttcrs to the Editor. This
complaining must stop! It‘s ridiculous to voice
your complaints. It just makes other people
mud. and gets you nowhere. last stop it.
cvcryonc. cut it out.

As Per Normal

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter to correct some
errors you had in your paper. ()ncc againsthc
ASP has shown sloppy. careless journalism
packaged under the guise ula newspaper. llus
hastardization of fact that appeared on page I
has got to he one of the worst.

Even before starting the article. the reader
should have been torewarnctl. The headline
feud "Room Rents Raised.“ What sort pl
heading is that for a story on 'l'clcthon ‘75!

The article itself was full of gross
inaccuracies and information not even related
to Telethon. Mr. llart's remarks on the
dormitory crowding were intercstin enough.
but Idon‘t think they were on the topic.

Reflexive

To the Editor:

I know this is strange. but I‘ve always
wanted to do this. 1 mean. its been a long-term
desire that has been very important to me.
Please understand.

The Editor.

Roughish

To the Editor:

I was strolling through the park one day. in
the very merry month of May. lwas taken by
surprise. by a pair of rougish eyes. as l was
strolling through the park one day!!!
