Honk-and :MacPhaiI at a Press

Conference

Remember I973. the “Year of the
Yankccs“? You know, Matty Alou.
Graig Nettle'and about of others
who helped trick the Last Vegas
oddsmakcrs into making the
Yankees the favorites in the East. Let
me take you back to those Yankees,
the team of clowns and excuses that
bit the proverbial boot and f inishcd
in fourth place.

Reporter ﬁlzsirs, by your recent
dealings for Matty Alan and Graig
Nettles, it would appear that you

have scrapped youryouth movement.

Would you care to comment?
Macl’hail: Well, let me make one
thingpcrfcctly clear: lam thcgcncral
manager, and the management of
the Yankees has always got the in-
terest of Yankee fans at heart.

Yes. we have scrapped the plan.
Honk: We have decided to trade the
future for now.

Reporter #2: Aren‘t you concerned
about your starting pitchers, cs-
pccially with the loss of Ron Gar-
dner? Didn‘t he keep you in the race
last year with his 8-3 second half‘.’
Mat-Phail.‘ Yes, he made a small con-
tribution. However, he made no
greater contribution than, say, for
instance: Fred Beene, Ron
Klimkowski. or Wade Blasingamc.
You see, we look at it this way: he
won enough games to balance out
their losses. thus, they all kept us in
the nice. You see, if Bccnc, Klim. or
Wade had won any games. we
probably would have won the pen-
nant. and than there wouldn't have
been any pennant racc. That would

- have defeated 'our five-turned seven

year plan, because instead of being a
contender. we would be a winner.
and Would have lied to our fans. and
then what would we do? So you see.
every Yankee made a contribution.

Now that we have sent Klim.
Wade, and Bccnc down to Syracuse.

we had to trade Gardner inordcr‘r)
balance the sheet. Otherwise. we
would bc plus 8 wins. and there
would be no race this ycar. and if
there was no rucc what would we do
for our ailing attcndnncc'.’

Hurt/r: We huvc as good a club as
anynnc clsc.

Reporter: Isn‘t Matty Alou a bit old
for your young nulluuk‘.’

- Mucl’hut‘l: Lct mc explain this
completely. Matty docs not really fit
in on the new Yttnkccs he isa good
hiltcr. kmth how to run the bases.
knows how to bunt. doesn‘t strike
out much. clc. Ahuwcvcr, his one
saving trait is his .300 ficlding
pcrccntagc.

You say that Matty istou old.but.
look at his brother, liclipc. Fclipc is
37. and as l’hil Riuuto always
reminds our fans. has a I7 year old
body. Sincc all thnsc pcnplc arc the
same. Matty at 34, must have a 13
year old body. As you know. at I]
the body is just beginning tomaturc.
Since most players play until they
are 40. we expect another 27 years of
playing mm him. '

How can you question a deal in
which we gained 27 years and 21.300
hitter for Gardner. :1 player who
merely balanccd tbc shccl. Besides.
(iardncr was a rcjcct from the minor
league club in Qtlccns.

Iluuk: It is time for uslo go out and
get it. The fans havc \vailcd long
enough.

Repur/t'r: M r. Macl’hai. what about
the 5 ycar plan'.’

MucI’hai/s 'lhnt's SIR it) you buy.
Lct mcl explain something about 5
qcar qVilns. First of all. cvcryunc
knows that 5 year plans arc a Cum-
munist invention and. as such.1lrc
dcsigncd tn undurminc the great
American pastime. As loyal
Yankees. and Amcricans, we cannot
tolerate this. licsidcs. and qccondly.
all live ycur plans are doomed IL)
failurc. Wc know.

Reporter: It has been rumored that
Matty Alou did not want to play for
the Yankees. Is this tru‘!

tltm-Phail: There is absolutely no
truth to this rumor. However. we did
have to send Felipe down there for
thrccdays to talk tohim. As you may
have gucsscd. when his brathcr told
him all about the benefits of being a
Yanch and playing in the Bronx. he
immediately agrccd to conic.
Besides. you know those people
stick together. and what bcttcrplacc
for one of them than in the Bronx.
Hun/r: l have il great relationship
with my players.
It’t'purlt'r.‘ What about the deal for
Charlie Spikes and Rusty Torres?
Haven‘t you been billing them as
future superstar? What if thllcs

The Ballad Of

It looked extremely dismal for the Ranger fans that day

And then when Park got caught up ice.

The blue seat fans all mutttcrcd that the scason‘d

Out on the ice was Egcrs hatching up the Rangers play.

And lincmnte Steven Vickers wished hc'd stayed in bed that day:
They tried their hand at forcchccking. but everyone could see.
Thcy sorely missed the I’olih I’rincc. the load named Stem-kow-ski.

But Stemmcr‘d Ich his purse at home. and could. not break his streak.
He had not thrown a singic check. for this. the fifth straight week,
So whilc the fans all manned and groancd, and Coach Francis

It started in the blue seats. and soon reached the lower tier;

It brought smiles to the Ranger fans and got Egch off the ice.

began to change,
Ilc quickly set up Fairbairn. and thcn lrvinc found the range:
And then when Gilbert scored a goal,

Amalingly. the Rangers, had come right back in In: game.

With just ten seconds left to play, and the face to Eddie‘s right.
Out on the ice came Stcmmcr‘s line. to try to tie that night;
And Stemmcr won that face-off, and dropped it back to Park.
