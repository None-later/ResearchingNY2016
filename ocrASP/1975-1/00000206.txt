The Albany Hyatt House is surprising isolated from the University
considering its proximity to the campus. Every day we quickly glance at it on
our way to and from school. trying to read the message of the day on its
billboard. Yet it seems thatnobody attempts to use its resources (except
perhaps for the infamous “waterbed suite”). We ﬁnally decided to cross the
Washington Avenue boundary in pursuitof culinary excitement. ,

There are two restaurants in the Hyatt House. “Hugo‘s Side Door” and the
"Coffee Shop.” Our pocketbooks determined that we opt for the latter. To
our surprise, the atmosphere was Quite pleasant. It is a peaceful room with
ﬂowers on every table and a relaxed atmosphere. Especially surprising was
the imaginative menu which was much more extensive than standard coffee
shop fare. A wide array of egg dishes are available. ranging from plain
omelettes to crepes. Sandwiches also range to the complex. including a
‘rancher‘s melt” ($2.95). a roast beef. turkey, and ham sandwich with bacon,
lettuce and tomato on grilled “cheese bread." Promising as the combination
sounded. it tpsted poor due in hrge part to the fatty. undercooked bacon. and
the paper thin bread which disintegrated in our hands. The accompanying
steak fries were bland and obviously frozen. The cole slaw. which seemed to
contain sour creamas well as mayonnaise. was creamy and reasonably good.

The hamburger variants were interesting. and include an “Old English"
burger ($2.95) which is essentially a hamburger with melted cheddar cheese
on english muffin. and the “SUNYA” burger ($2.65). a cheeseburger with
shredded lettuce and tomato on rye. We have not yet ﬁgured out the
signiﬁcance of the title.

The coffee shop offers a number of entrees. which includes use of its salad
bar. The selection of food at the salad barwas special. as it featured slices of
fresh honeydew melon garnished with lemon wedges. and a fruit salad
consisting of fresh strawberries. oranges. and pineapples. in addition to the
normal green salad. tomatoes. and breads. Unfortunately. the honeydew was
not completely ripe..but the coffee shop‘s attention to such amenities as fresh
melon in the winter, is noteworthy.

The entrees themselvesranged widely in price. but did include several in
the 54-6 range. We tried the broiled calves liver. smothered with onions and
Canadian bacon. The portion was generous. the liver was tender, but the
food lacked the little extra tastiness that elevates good food into excellent. it
also came with steak fries and a baked-apple which was totally lacking in
ﬂavor.

We ﬁnished‘our in with coffee (not bad) and cheesecake. We have an
admitted weakness for cheesecake. but almost left the piece half eaten. It was
bland. mushy. and overpoWered by a vile strawberry topping.

The Albany Hyatt House Coffee Shop is a pleasant restaurant in an
extremely convenient location. ltvis open until 10:00 at night. It does not
offer the best cuisine in Albany. but nonetheless. its attention to amenities
such as the salad bar. ﬂowers and service. and its imaginative menu make it
worthwhile to visit.

Nemesis. the goddess of retribu-
tion. arranged that Narcissus should
see his own face in a pool of wutcrut
tltc tom of Mt. Helicon; he became
obsessed with his own beauty and
fell deeply in love with his own
rcllcction. Unable to draw himself
away from the pool or to receive
satisfaction for his love. he pined
away and died. In pity. and in
recognition of his beauty. the gods
transformed him into the narcissus
ﬂower.

The psychologicul truth expressed
in this myth wus recognized by Sig-
mund Freud. who coined the term
nurclsslsm to refer to a psychological
condition in which there is It fixation
of sexual energy upon the self. Freud
believed that the child‘s sexual
energy should at first he focused on
the parents and then transferred to
others; but iI‘Ihc child is repulsed by
unloving parents. this energy cannot
be directed to others and so returns
to itself.

Presumany when Socrates said
"Know thyself." he was not thinking
of Narcissus.
