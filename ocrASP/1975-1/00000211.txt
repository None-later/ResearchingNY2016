Making your mark in business used to mean
carving a comfortable niche for yourselt and stay-
ing there. Promotion was simply a matter of time.
provided you could spend 20 years In the process.
But. today, business depends on technology. Tech-
nology that can't wait a moment If it's gorng to keep
pace with what’s happening. ' D _

That's why, at Kodak, our bastc reliance on scr-
entitic research makes the need for creative young
minds more demanding than ever. We must have
people with drive and ambition, impatient to put
what they've learned into practice. People who get
all the freedom and responsibility they can handle.
and tackle our problems with their ideas.

Which, we're happy to say. has helped 'many of
our scientists yield important discoveries. For.
example: i

The woman on the left has devised new and im-
proved photographlc materials tor specialized scr-
entifio applications in fields such as astronomy and
holography. The young man IS an expert on surface
analysis. His work in photoelectron spectroscopy

helps to identify unknown substances. The woman
on the right has a dual background in gas chroma-
tography and trace metal analysis. which she's ap-
plied to analyzing pollution in rivers and streams.

They came up with new problems while solving
some of our old ones. But they've uncovered some
promising answers. too. As they continue their re-
search. you may read about them again. The oldest
-isiust over 30.

Why do we give young men and women so
much room to test their ideas? Because good ideas

’ «:1 ,

often lead to better products. Which are good tor .

business. And we're in business to make a protlt.
But in furthering our own business interests. we
also further society's interests. Which makes good

sense.
Atter all. our business depends on society. So
we care what happens to it.
