The Albany Great Dane lacrosse
team continued their dominance
over OswegoVState with a powerful
l7-3 victory over the visiting Great
Lakers Wednesday in their season
opener. '

The ﬁfty or so people who braved
the cold to see the game saw Albany.
who has never lost to Oswego in
lacrosse. open the scoring in the first
quarter on goals by Steve Schaus
and Dan Goggin. After Oswego clos-
ed the gap to 2-I. .Iay Kinnka and
Pete Connor added goals to make it
4-I after one quarter. Terry Brady
picked up two ofhis six assists in this
q uartcras he fed midfielders Schnus
and Connor on their goals.

From that point on it was all

State. as both Ooggin and Brady
went to work. Brady from behind the
cage twice hit Goggin. who was
breaking in on the cage.-for scores.
Goggin later added another off a
nice pass from Schaus. Arnie Will
and Brady also hit the nets for State
as they built up a 9-I halftime lead.

The second half was much the

same as Albany continued to-

dominate. The Danes defense of Bill
Jonat. Dave Ahoncn. and Joe Mul-
len completely neutralized Oswego‘s
attack.

Meanwhile. the State offensive
rttacbinc kept right on rolling. ad-
ding two gottls in tltc third quarter
and then bombarding Oswcgo‘s
goalie Larry Troch for six more
scores in the fourth quarter. Brady

led the second half charge as he add-
ed two goals and two more assists.
He was joined by Dan Goggin who
bagged his fifth. Bob Williams who
scored twice. Craig Roberts. and
Steve Schaus and Pete Connor both
getting their} second goals of the
game.

Coach Armstrong was “pleased
with the way the kids played and
later commented that “it was some
way to start the season."

Indeed it was. Albany successfully
cleared the ball 50 percent of the
time. scored while beinga man up six
of nine times and did not give up a
goal on any of its nine man down
situations. The Danes controlled the
ground ball. scooping up 80 of I22
loose balls rind took I7 of 24

In addition. the play of goalies

Field Events Hold Key for Tracksters

State University at Albany‘s track
and field team will. according to
coach Hob Munscy. “Be dominated
by the field events to u lurgcrdegrec
than ever before."

With the loss of Ill solid scorers
from last year‘s III-0 squad. the
(lrcal Danes will be. "wanting in
tltosc events in which we have been
most formidable irt the past."
Munscy said.

The distance events ltavc been
decimated with the loss of Jim
Shrader. Vince Reda. Herb llasan.
and Rich Langford. Munscy will be
relying upon returning veterans
Carlo Cherubino. an All-American
in I974. and Chris llurns.
Cberubirto. ajuniur. will be used lor
the three and six mile events. while
soph Burns will run the mile and oc-
cttsionully the two nttd three mile
runs.

attained varsity status in I969. “that
freshman I‘rcd Kitzrow. sophomore

in the distance events.

“Another freshman." he cott-
tirrued. "who could help us is Ilrian
Davis. who has rttrt n 4:lll mile in
high school. but didn‘t show muclt in
the indoor season this winter. The in-
door. however. provided him more
of a speed workout than anything

"The 880 poses a question at this
time." Munsey noted. "because we‘re
not sure of the number of quality
people we have out at this time."
Tom Crowley. a junior. will be one

of the few veterans in the event. “He

was out a couple of years ago.“ the
coach stated. “and did a linejob for
us. If he urn whip the injury
problem. he could be heard from."

Concerning the 440 relays. he
feels. "our team could be a good one

freshman liob Colletti. wc‘ll definite-
Iy have a good rclrry group.“

In all of tltc track events the
biggest problem facing Munsey is
the lack ol'dcpth. with tltc exception
of the sprints. "We ltnve the people
here that we lack in the other run-
ning events." he said.

"We haven‘t got any 9.5 men in the

“We have a freshman. Mike
