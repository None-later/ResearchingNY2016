liver itear of art integrating

it‘s not an unbiased immigration of-
licial. Nor is it something they throw
into the cafeteria food.

(iiye up‘.’ It's just one of the many
instruments trsed iii the Atmospheric
Sciences Research Center weather
statiort at the top of Mohawk Tower.
()I' course!

You see. I had just happened to be
riding in the Mohawk Tower
elevator one day. for no particular"
reason otlter than to write a story.
When the elevator stopped. I walked
up another ﬂight of stairs trntil it
dawned on rtte that there were no
nto re stairs! llaving nowhere to go. i
decided to knock on the door.

'I he smiling. Itattdsomc face of a
brmvn-haircd young man sttddenly
appeared and hade the enter. | in-
trod u ccd mysell and my p rupose turd
learned that the t‘cd-sltirtcd. bitte-
ieart clad "keeper" wlto stood before
rue was Michael Landin (not the ae-.
tor). "I‘m a senior." he said. “and.
yes. the assistant to Mr. (Ray)
Falconer, He's in charge ofthis btttl
keep the place going; cltcekirtg the
data. changing the ink. and stttl‘flike
that.“

Before I could ﬁnd out wltat he
meartt by changing the ink. he began
his tour. The station itself takes up
all ol the 24th floor with the middle
portion blocked off becatrse ol' the
location ofthe elevators. One can see
everything for miles around just by
walking arottnd tlrgnroom.

"lhis is a condensation nuclei
counter." said Landin. pointing to
something that looked like a stereo
component complete witlt a ltose
that extended otttsidc. “It measures
the number of tiny particles In the

t

air. such as dust. and stuff like that.“
After describing its operation. he
showed mc’the graph paper where a
needle was oscillating. and said.
"Right now there are H.000 particles
per cubic centimeter in theair." lwas
understandably thunderstruck but
decided» against fainting. Then I
knew what the ink was for!

“Over here is a reﬂected light
monitor." he continued. "It can tell
yott what kinds of clouds are in the
air by tltcway the sun‘s light hits the
monitor." He described it in more
detail but I couldn't quite grasp the
physical properties of thecxplana-
tiort.

Anyway. he contintred the tour by
showing me the mercurial barometer
on the wall. (A baronteter. for you
uninformed. measures air pressure).
“A lot of people wouldn‘t think that
there is that much difference
between air pressure on the ground
and air pressure at the top of the
tower." he said. “But there is tip to
4. Itiths of an inch difference! That
would probably surprise sonte peo-
ple." (It didn‘t surprise me iii the
least!) “\Vhen weather shows on
television or radio talk of the
barometric pressure. they give it at
sea level so it wor . be confusing."

Then we eatne to the
rnierobarogt'aphIl‘hat is used to
record changes in pressure. “the
(initiator ol'air pressure is the impor-
tant thing. “this needle is rising.“ lie
said. pointing to it. "that ntcans a
high p rcssurc system isapproaching;

which meatts gootl weather. ll‘it goes

down. we may be in for a storm or
something. like that.“ “Now here."
ltc said. tttrrting toward the other
side of the wall. “is art integrating

it.) “ill is measures the mass concen-
