in Fort ’L‘auderdalef‘ through '

arrangements made by the Cooper
205 Travel Club. Bus reservations
cost 55 dollars round trip and room
accommodations ranged from 55 to
65 dollars according to the occupan-
cy number. Several students wound
up spending more money than they
had planned to due to a number of
unfortunate mishaps.

The trip got off to a slow start and

got progressively worse. The:

students returned from their vaca-
tion sun-tanned and slightly dis-
gruntled. Judy Lieb complained of
the buses arriving late to New York
City. Many students had arrived in
the city by 7 A.M. expecting to leave
by 7:30. There were no buses in sight
and when they did arrivethey did not
depart until 8:|5. Erwin Levin. who
was in charge of the bus
arrangements asserted that depar-
ture time was not scheduled until 8
A.M., contrary to what the students
believed. The students were follow-
ing the trip schedule solicited by the
Cooper 205 Travel Club, which had
the departure time listed as 7:30.
Complications thickened when it
was discovered that there were not
enough seats for two students on the
bus. According to Erwin Levin he
had contracted 3 buses. each having
47 open seats. Unfortunately one of
the bus drivers saw lit to bringalong
his wife and two kids and two other
bus drivers who were supposed to
have been flown to Fort Lauder-
dale for the return trip were also
aboard the bus. The two students
received half of their fare back and
they did not have to stand on the ret-

A Club later learned that the shuttleis '

driver hadrdied Or something as
equally obnoxious. The students had
to either walk the three miles to the
beach or'rely on public’transporta-
tion. Complaints were also-raised
that the Hotel ‘was not geared for
college students. as the students were
requested to keep the noise down to
a minimum after “:00.

The Cooper 205 Travel Club felt
that the hotel was an older.
moderate. first class hotel. just as
they had promised. Michael
Sirignano. who was in charge of the
hotel accommodations. stated that
he Would not use the hotel again. for
they had been cheated in regard to
the non-existent shuttle bus.

Despite the inconveniences of
public transportation and a lack of
night life nearby the hotel. everyone
managed to make their own good
time.

Unfortunately. on the return trip
to New York one ofthe buses broke
down and so two busloads of
students were delayed for about
seven hours. The biggest gripe here
was that although another bus came
to replace the broken one. the bus

drivers refused to use the hits as it

Would cost the company an extra 400
dollars. The students were nearing a
mutiny when the bus was ﬁnally
repaired. and they were forced to
travel the next four hours in 30
degree weather without any heat.

The members of the Cooper 205

Travel Club. Ernest Sprance. Erwin
Levin. Mike 'Sirignano and Tom
N.ystrom maintained that the events
were simply unforeseeablc mishaps
which they could have done nothing
to avoid. They had used thebuscom-
puny (Allstate Bus Company) before
on their Miami trip this Christmas
and had no problems at all. They
agreed that they would use this com-
pany again. probably for trips they
plan to run next semester. They
pointed out that although none of
them went on the Fort Lauderdalc
trip. they had paid representatives to
perform thesamc functions that they
had on the Miami trip.

Frank Jackman. who was on the
bus which did notbreak down on the
return trip. thought that the bus ride
was a very good deal. He would not
however use the travel club‘s accom-
modations again.

 

(ZNS) If there are intelligent creatures on other planets in the universe.
what do they look like? Are they green. jelly-like blobs? Do they resemble

giant insects?

Biologist Robert Bicri has written an article for American Scientist
magazine arguing that advanced. intelligent beings probably look very much

like carthlings.

Bieri says that extraterrestiuls will look like us because the pathways which

evolution follows are strictly limited.

Bieri argues that air-breathing land-roaming humanoids offer the best
solutions to deal with an earth-like environment. He states that intelligent
beings will probably have an anterior brain and closely associated sense
organs. a structure similar to the human head.

The biologist adds that the creatures will have pairs ofappenditges. such as

Bob O‘Brein gives his group fun-

ding philosophy: “The amount of

money you need to sucessfully carry
out your objectives and your
program. is the amount of money
that should be funded if possible.“
O‘Brein also favors ‘closer control"
on group funding.

Ken Wax advocates “a well done.
credible survey that would provide a
useful guide in how the students
want their money spent." Wax adds
that the “new SA government should
look into SA groups more closely.
There are a lot of groups that have
been well over-budgeted."

Dave Coyne stresses mass program-
ming as very important: “The
highest priority must be sufficient
funding for those groups serving the
largest number of students. it is
economically unadisttble to spend
large amounts of money on small
numbers of students."

Andy Buumun considers muss
programming and recreational fun—
ding iis the top priority for SA. He
also feels that SA should "cut the
