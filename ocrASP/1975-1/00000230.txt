Country Life - Roxy Music (Atlan-
tic)

Arriving in a plain green wrapper
so as not to corrupt the innocent is
the new Roxy Music album. Coun-
Iry 'Li/e. And the best thing about it
is that it‘s as interesting musically as
it is visually.

The end result of the efforts of
Bryan Ferry and company has
always been an extremely stylized
brand of rock. and as such com-

manded a small cult-like following.
When Eno left the group just before
the Slrunded album. it was a clear
case of one too many captains on
board ship. and the “ncw" Roxy.
with Ferry in full control. took a
slightly altered course. Roxy became
an instrument for Ferry and so grew
similar in form to his solo releases.
But instead of the highly stylized rc-
arrangemcnt of classics. Roxy
offered highly stylilcd originals.
crcatcd expressly by and for Ferry
and the group.

In this mt. Colouri- Life to

divitluel euteare able to stand on
their own without the added
support—or excuse. perhape—of
“oh. it‘s a Roxy album”. movitg
them from the common aesthetic.
judging them on their own stan-
dards.

For. even Roxy abandons its own
standards. Like the cars that are
designed to disintegrate as soon as
the newer models are on the road.
the manner in which each new Roxy
Music album drives those before it
into obsolescence is carefully
calculated. It isa back-wash insuring
that the audience remains alert and
the master of ceremonies remains
one step ahead of them. And that
step is the secret of Roxy‘s populari-
ty and staying power. Fcrrycxplains
it: “...musica|ly our main develop-
ment has been becoming more
genuine. There has been no hoax. It
could have gone incredibly

Cliehéd Circus

Circus - Argent (Epic)
Remember “Hold Your Head

Up“! Well drive it right back out of
your~rniad.‘~becaue Circus item
comes near itsArgent'a new release. a
concept enough“ a lighter feel
than that heavy-handed‘roclt single

they broke with about three years

ago. They have developed as
musicians since then and it shows:
there are some excellent instrumen-
tal peeragee on the album. notably
on the .title cut and on ‘fTrapeze‘. in,
fact. the whole record is heavily in-
strumental and this is its saving
grace.

The circus is a rich subject for an
album theme. and for a really fine
job check out Nektar‘s Down To
Eurlh. Argon. however. prefers to
concentrate on the circus as a
metaphor for life. and the result is
vague and clichcwiddcn.

The vocals work well on "Clown"
and “Trapclc” but “Circus”. the
opener. force-feeds the lyrics and
"H ighwirc“ is a direct steal of theme
and mood from Leon RUSSCII'S
“Tightrope”. To add to the effect.
Rod Argent‘s voicc gives a strained
perfomtance throughout. They're
trying too hard.

(1ch them credit. though. l'ornot
tmnsfonning Argent into a Top 40's
hit factory. Their aspirations are
higher than AM radio. Cirrus is
just—if you‘llailow the use of an old

friend's favorite expression the isun-
fortunately no longer with here at
SUNYA)--»(‘r’rr'u.t is just "an experi-
ment that failed."

has been bitten by the bug. hunte-
combed ‘to, the disease—he .har
becomega commercial property. It
seems li’erbieien't satisﬁed with “on-
ly" being one of the great names. in
modern jazz: he wants to be a
superstar. So he needs a hit single'
and a hit album and a successful
tour. -

two out of three isn't bad for a
start. Hit songs are created through
AM airplay. and thconly musicthtit
is really making it big today is pop
and soul. “Hi-jack". the single.
covers the latter. Dis-rur/rr'qm'. the
album. covers all the rest. from Paul
Williams to AWB to La Belle and
even two of licrbic‘s own com-
positions. It was the tour. though.
that was disheartening. Recently at
the Beacon theatre in Manhattan.
Herbie Mann played to it three
quarters empty house his just
reward for charging eight-fifty per
ticket.

No matter what he plays. though.
llcrbie Marni is still llcrbic Mann.
and unquestionably a master on the
ﬂute. His arrangements are impec-
cable. his choice of musicians ex-
cellent. But in the face of all his
previous work. in comparing “Hi-
jack“ to the classic “Memphis Un-
derground". Discotheque is adisap-
pointmcnt. Almost a betrayal.
