' decsters Win

by Jon Lafayette

it all came down to the last event
for the track team in Wednesday‘s
meet againstWilliams at the Univer-
sity field. A scoring mistake of two
points made the score seem even
closer than it was at the end.

Williams opened the meet by tak-
ing the 440 yard relay as a mistake
caused an Albany pass to go outside
the passing zone, disqualifying the
team. Rudy Vido put the shot49'l V2”
to make the score Williams 8.
Albany 6. Brian Davis won the mile
in 4:223. with Tom Ryan second in
4125.4 but the scorer only gave
Albany 6 points (points are awarded
5 for first place. 3 for second.and I '
for third in a dual meet) instead of
the eight they had won. making the
score Albany l2. Williams 9. This
error would notbenoticed untilafter
the meet with the two points missing
all through the running score until
the end.

Dave Cole took the l20 yard high
hurdles. but a mix-up between the
timers and the starters meant no time
was taken. Coach Bob Munsey
thought that “Cole's time was
probably excellent because the race
was very tight. about six inches at the
finish." Tom Pardini took the long
jump with a leap of20’7”with Hiram
Febles third. Jim Holloway then
took thediscus by throwingit l33’l”.

Brian Davis won the 880m 1159.6,
scoring a double (he also took the
mile) but again Albany would be
hurt in the sprints. Two Williams
runners. Dave Parker and Michael
Reed. beat Art Redford in the 440.
Joe Newsomeand Regan Miller beat
Albany‘s Alan Zube in tlie l00 yard
dash. and bob Ashley and (ilen
Harris of Williams went l-2 over
Roger Phillips in the 440 yard in-
termediate hurdles. State's Gary
Johnson finished second in the 220
which was won by William's New-
somc. and Bill Mayer and Pierre
Beuvoir captured second and third
in the pole vault. Albany still trailed
(they thought) by l2. 57 to 45.

Albany got tough. winning four of
the next five events. 'I'om Clettry

threw the javelin l74'6" and Perry
Hoeltzel threw it 159’2 to take 1-2 in
that event. Carlo Cheribino and
Chris Burns tied in the two mile.
erasing the Williams lead and put-
ting Albany up by 2 at 6i-59. Bob
Malone collected 5 big points by
winning the high jump at 6'0". with
Williams coming in second and
third. The lead was now 3 points
with only the mile and the triple
jump remaining.

Williams took the relay. gathering
all five points in that event to put
Albany in the hole,down by two. All
eyes were on the triple jump area
where State‘s Jim Pollard was first
followed by two Williams men with
one jump left. In that order,
everyone thought. Albany would
lose by one. Hiram Febles‘ lastjump
of 42'll" won the event to give
Albany five points. and with Jim
Pollard finishing second. the ﬁnal
score looked to be 74-69. No one
knew that the score was really tied
going into the triple jump so Febles
and Pollard really bore out despite
being under intense pressure.

Munsey Happy

Coach Bob Munsey said he was
“very happy. winning the closeones'
are great." Freshman Brian Davis.
who Won both the 880 and the mile
and Tom Ryan who finished second
in the mile both looked very good. as
did Dave Cole and Stu Finton in the
hurdles. lie was very happy to see
Bob Malone go 6' in the bighjump,
especially alter a foot injury which

bothered him all through the indoor
season. Jim Pollard and lliram
licbles were impressivcalso. Mttnsey
callittg I’ebles "a tougli little
competitor. He was glad to see Rudy
Vido and the weight men come
through. “Our field events outscored
our runners 4236 in this meet and
l40-l35 over the season. and
remember there are |0 truck events
and only seven field events.

The next meet. on Saturday will
see Oneonta. Oswego, and
Plattitburgh all come in and Coach
Munsey feels “it will take a
mountainous effort to win

end ofa 7-2 score just 24 hours after
their 6-5 squeaker over RPI.

The two-game split left Albany
with a 2-5 record this spring and a I-
l slate in the Capital District Con-
ference.

Okoniewski allowed only two bits
in his 8 and l/3 innings of work but
also yielded ten walks which proved

to be his downfall. The Danes. after .

previous day to pick up a win.

heading into the ninth inning of the
Siena contest.

But four Indian runs on four
walks put the game out of reach and
stalled any hopes the hosts had of
winning their first two C.D.C. games
of the year.

In all fairness to Okoniewski, it
must be noted that the righty senior
did not allow a hit from the second
innning on. “Rick threw a great
game between the second and ninth
innings,“ said Coach Bob
Burlingame. “A fabulous game!"
And even with the walks. “it was
anybody's game until the ninth."

Rick got off to at shaky start in the
first by walking Mark Frye with one
out and then giving up a run-scoring
double to Gary Holle. Holle stole
third and scored on an errantpickoff
throw by catcher Vic Giulianelli to
put the Danes down 2-0. Okoniewski
later walked two more batters in the
inning but escaped without further
damage.

Siena upped its advantage to 3-0
in the following frame when
Malcolm Kilmer singled. advanced
on two wild pitches. and scored on a
sac fly. Until theninth, theywere not
to seriously threatened again.

Fatal“ (Batman Loss  * .

State got on the scoreboard in

‘their half of the second when Jay

Milauskas reached second on a dou-
ble error by third baseman Fryc,and
scored on a wicked single down the
leftfield line by Mike Gamage.

The Danes. who incidentally out-
hit the winners by ans-4 margin, cut
the lead to one in the eighth when '
Paul Nelson tripled up the right-
ccntcralley and Interscorcd on an in-
field crror. '

Okoniewski was obviously ti red at
this point and after getting the
leadoffman in the ninth. walked the
next three batters before being
removed. Bob Kronenbcrgcr reliev-
ed aud on a 3-2 pitch to I-Iolle. gave
up the Danes‘ eleventh walk of the
game. forcing in the. fourth Sicnn
run.

Tom Paradise then delivered a
two run single forthc fifth and sixth
runs. while the final tally crossed us
the result of ti Kronenberger wild
pickoff attempt. But the Danes
refused to yield in their htilfas John
lrace. a late inning sub. and
pinchhitter Glenn Sowulskie.
delivered base hits with one out.
When Nelson was hit by a pitch to
load the bases with two outs. they
still had a chance. ButTom Blair was
robbed of a hit by firstvbascman
Holle who flipped to pitcher Mike
Ruane for the final ottt on a very
close play.

Ruane pitched a fine game. getting
his outs when most needed. Five of
his six strikeouts came with runners
on base,and with thedefense turning
three doubleplays behind him. he
was unbeatable.

Albany's thirdbaseman. Jim
Willoughby. turned in the best
defensive play of the game in the

sitaayﬂprti 18, 1975

ﬁfth. Holle smacked a vicious shot '
down the line which was labeled two-
bngger all the way. Willoughby dove
headfirst to his right. snared the ball
in his outstretched glove on a hop as
he hit the ground. scrambled to his
feet. and madea perfect throw tojust
nip the runner.
Willoughby Stars

But it was Willoughby‘s but which
was the key to the Danes‘ 6-5 win
over RPI on Monday. He lashed out
three singles and drove in two runs in
that contest to back up a fine initial
pitching effort by Sowalskic.

The Danes had scored single runs
in the second (on .leff Breglio‘s
squeeze hunt) and third (on
Willoughby's rbi single) to lead 2-0.
The Engineers then cut the gap to

aided by two big errors.

But RI’I again ctit the lead to one
by tallying four times of their own in
the sixth. Three singles. a walk. and
an error did the trick before
Sowalskic closed the door. "That
was the best fastball I‘ve had since
the summer league (of high school
days).“ said the righty.

Sowalskie Tires

Sowalskie tired in the seventh and
was replaced by Kroncnberger who
did a superb mop up job in picking
up his first save of the young season.
Nelson also lendcd a hand with a
fantastic diving catch in deep right
late in the game.

So. the Duties are off until Tucs-
day when they face Hartwick in a
home contest at 3:30. Blair is the
probable starter with John Dollard

‘ In a game that saw the Great
Danes lead by as many as three and
trail by as many as four. the Albany
lacrosse team dropped their first
game of the season I No to the very
tough Brockport team.

The Golden Eagles opened to
scoring in the first quarter as at-
tackman Ken Balslou scored on the

weren‘t taking advantage of their
man up opportunities. Twice in the

The Student Association of the
State UnivcrsitytSASU) held a con-
ference this past weekend at the
SUNY Agriculture and 'l'ecliuicul
School in Cllllltlll. New York. The
meeting was highlighted by the
demands of two affirmative action
caucuses. one of women and the
other by third world students.

At the sonic fittic SASU spott—
sored a Communications Coti-
fcrcnce that was attended by strident
newspaper and radio station people
from many SUNY schools
throughout the state.

The two caucuses presented it
policy statement that included
changes iii SASU's by-laws. They
read in purl:“Affirmative Action isu
positive pluti to implement ll policy
which actively opposes racism anti
sexism . . . \vc I'ccogtlilc that \vc
must ourselves make certain changes

iii our policies and in house
procedures and that this is the
elementary step in furthering a
program of Affirmative Action both
within the SUNY system and the
:socicly us a whole."

'l‘liough the affirmative action
proposals were at first discussed in
an atmosphere of tension and
parliamentary confusion. lhc SASU
delegate assembly did approve parts
of a substitute affirmative action
proposal writtcti by it group of peo-
ple including Linda Kitboolian. u
S U NY A representative. The
proposal requires that various
measures be taken to insure proper

tion iti SASU. ()thcr proposals will

NYPIRG Referendum
Decided By SA Ballot

by Daniel Gaines

A NYPIRG (New York Public Iti-
terest Research Group) referendum
will be on the ballot in next week's
SA elections that. if passed. would
provide foran increase in the student
tax fee ofonc dollar per scmcstcrtttid
an equal amount to be drawn from
elsewhere in the SA budget. to total
an estimated 536.000 Albany NYP-
IR 0 budget that would be
guaranteed for two years. This
assumes that the mandatory student
tax fee will be reapprovcd by the
students in u scpatntc referendum
next week.

Tobe binding the referendum will
need twenty pcrcctit of the students
eligible to vote. The only groups to
get more money this year than what
NYI’IRU will probably receive are
the intercollegiate sports board. the
AA It and Concert lloard.

Albany NYI’R l(i Chairperson
Arthur Malkiu said: “I‘m positive
that if It student understands PIRG
Iic will vote ‘ycs‘."

dcfculed last week fll SUNY

The student government lltcrc and

EOPSA’s Cultural
Phase VI Underway

by lietty Stein

Survival. l~'()PSA‘s sixth annual cultural events \vcck begun yesterday with
this llictuc as ll common denominator for its many events.
“We tliiuk this is significant. especially with some of the things that will be

happening this year . . .

and next year." said Freddie Stokclin. EOPSA

President. Stokclin was referring to the potentially serious implications of
recently-made gottch iti SUNYA‘s budget.

Cultural Phase VI. as it is officially culled. is expected to climax liridny
night with llll appearance by Angela Davis. Other events will include an a-
cuputtctut'e lecture and demonstration. slated for tonight; It Third World
media arts presentation, to be given tomorrow; and a talent show. set for

Wednesday.

The two concerts uitd Iluruutli Dance Company performance this

weekend are expected to draw ll racially mixed audience. “White people on.

campus know what's happening.“ explained Stokeliu. “We've been into 8.8.
King for u Iotig time; you all are just picking up on it."

Stokeliu expects 2.000 to 3.000 people to take part iii the week‘s activities.
Ilccited the fact that $1.000 worth of weekend utcnl tickets hadalrendy been
sold as an indication of this. Stokeliu culled FSA "great fans" of lllack Week
("that‘s what they usually call it“). asserting that. “Any other tiuic. we haven
hell of a hassle. 'l'liey‘rc very receptive to anything flint Clllthpl'Ofilttblc.“

"I‘d like to see cvcryweck ltlnck Week.“ said Stokeliti. who cltiims “We‘re
otin thought about when it comes around to llluck Week time." He stressed
the function ol‘the event as a means of increasing awareness: "The majority of
people onctunpus still don't know what EOPSA is.“ Stokelin hopes that this
can be changed: “We‘re always viewed as different iii a negative sense. but

we‘ve always viewed ourselves as different fit it positive sense."
