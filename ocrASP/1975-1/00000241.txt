I FSA To AAB To SA .
There has been some debate within Student Association in recent weeks about
whether ognot the “85,000 loan money returned to SA from FSA(Facufty-Stud¢nl
_ Asmciation) in February should be only used for intercollegiate sports by AM!
{Eirg (Athletic Advisory Board). The money originally came from the AAB surplus.
Over the past few yars Central Council has regularly approved giving $7.25 Out of
' each student‘s $32.00 semesterly tax fee to AAB, to be distributed among the various
sports programs by them. Besides saving Council the trouble of going through all the
details of the intercollegiate team budgets, the AAB permits SUNYA to meet the
 requirement of the NCAA that the teams be under institutional control because there

i are faculty and students on the AAB. Giving these non-students some control over
‘ student tax money has been traditionally thought of as a small price to pay for NCAA
membership.

Years ago AAB didn't use all the funds allocated to it by Council (it amounts to a
a; quarter of the SA budget) and so an AAB surplus has been built up. The money has
' been invested in various ways over the years, the bulk being loaned our to FSA a few
years ago and with favorable rates to both SA and FSA. In recent years. AAB has
needed to take some money out of the surplus to cover the rising costs of operating an

     

 

 

'  . s. intercollegiate spons program and from various special events.
A { Now that SA recalled the loan some have suggested that it would be morally wrong
if to spend the money on anything but AAB. They reason that since it comes from the
E _ g} AAB surplus and can help support AAB when they go into the red; thus it will he
‘3- ; '. unnecessary for AAB to ask for more money in future years. However. this is not :1
N moral issue. Obviously AAB was able to operate successfully and efficiently with less
2: ’ than theiralloitcd money in some years. Though they should not be penalized for being
 I efficient. there is no reason to cxcmpt AAB from the budget cutbacks and reanalyses of
35. ' the allocations received by other SA organizations. going on now in the wake of a
{1' depressed national economy and changing student priorities.
 _ 7 AAB has no .iloru/ right to that money. There should bea presumption in favor of
it} j permitting them to use it since it was originally allocated to them. But if Counctl
til   decides that the many moticy‘starvcd groups on campus havea greater need. and that
'05 ' students would be better served by reallocation. then by all means they should feel free
. to distribute thc money accordingly.
it. , A decision on the use of this money can be avoided by Council. its they often timid
 . challenging issues. ’l‘hcrc has been. however. increasing discussion in recent months
I ‘ about exactly what the one—quarter of SA‘s budget spent on intercollegiate sports is
if;  doing furthc sittdcntson ihiscampus compared to alltlie other places the moneycould
f} . ‘ go.
Li: ' ’lhc l'SA loan money adds a dimension to the issue that makes it imperativcthiit  WEPH. . . WE HAVE WPK TO D0.//
if both major branches of SA government carefully evaluate the pros and cons of our

intercollegiate athletics program.
