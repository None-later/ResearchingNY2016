,ypla ,trtrrg written, by Alice
. Children this weekend in the Arenrl

Theater; Unfortunately. ‘ publicity
for‘the show was virtually nil around
the campus and the theater was half
empty . during the performance I
viewed. Although the sparse crowds
tended to dampen my enthusiasm.
the play turned out to be not only
entertaining. but also an enlighten-

. ing experience.

- .The program read “in cooperation
with experimental theaterr"
however, much of that cooperation

' was lacking, according to members

of the all-black cast.

The plot action centered around
some black people attending a picnic
sponsored by their neighborhood
association. The characters
represented various black
stereotypic roles ranging from the
young. slightly arrogant, ﬂashily
dressed cavalier to the played out
grandfather ﬁgure who has long
since outlived his usefulness in this
life. There was also the young. light
skinned black woman, both the
organizer of the picnic as well as the
social worker type. The cast was
completed by two “neighborhood”
women as well asa third who played
the part of a preadolesccnt girl.

The old man, Joe, played by
James Adams-was always in the

The Albany Symphony Orchestra
concluded its l974-75 season with a
colorful program. The two Works,
Berlioz‘ Symphony Fantastique and
Benjamin Brittcn‘s Spring
Symphony, as different as they were,
were similar in that both were highly
imaginative orchestral showpieces.
the latter employing a full chorus.
Julius Hegyi. the "renowned" con-
ductor was, as usual. in ﬁne form;
hair and jacket tails ﬂowing, in
between the lavish curtain calls. To
the tune of the applause of his ap-
preciative audience and the flashing
lights above the maestro's head, the
season closed successfully. Berlioz'
piece was truly a meansto that end.

The "Fantastic" Symphony is in-
deed just that-a programmatic
symphony depicting an artist on a
bad opium trip as a result of an un-
happy love. She reappears in each
movement symbolized by an
awkward melody. molded and
cleverly disguised in the develop-
ment of each of the five sections.
Wherever our.scnsitivc artist ﬁnds
himself——in the country. at a hall,
etc.. she appears..The story ends as
he dreams he kills her and he himself
is condemned to the’scaffold withan
ultimate Witches“ Sabbath for his
burial.

symphony's performance of it was

way. The other characters shoved
him around and accused him of
stealing the wallet of the younger
ﬂashy L.V. Cr'aig (played by Michael
Barker). Their accusationswere bas-
ed solely on circumstantial, trivial
bits of evidence; yet I too was led to
believe he (Joe) stole the wallet. Even
the organizer who wanted everyone
to get along and believed in the
goodness of people was convinced
that Joe had stolen the wallet. She
tried not to let this on to him but her
efforts were useless. What did come
through was an attempt to shame
him into guiltily returning
something he hadn‘t taken at all. The
two characters interacted extremely
well with one another at this point
and one was left with a disturbing
sense of reality from this scene.

The quality of the acting in the
play was not very high. The actors
for the most part gave adequate if
not exceptional performances.~Mrs.
Beverly, one of the neighborhood
women (played by Stephanie
Stewart) had the potential to be
better but site started her perfor-
mance on such a high tense note that
she was leftwith nowhere to go as the
play progressed. Joe. the old man

was by no meant a heavy intellectual

after the show. this group feeling was
evident. as all the actors were friend-
ly and relaxed, unlike previous ex-
periences with most experimental
theater groups. _

String' was by no meansa first rate
theatrical success; yet it offered
something entirely different to the
audience. A chance to laugh and en-
joy oneself without fear of missing
the important themes of the play.
More than anything. it was a social
commentary on the relationships
between some ordinary people.

unable to understand most of the
texts which ranged fromg-lgtth cen-
tury to contemporary English. The
tragedy of this performance was the
fact that the text should be the
primary force of the work. the music
and orchestral colors, merely
supplements to the chorus. At times.
as a result of the poor diction. the
reverse was true. A copy of the text
was properly included in the
program but was impossible to read
in the dark theater. We Were
frustrated to no end and relieved at
the end of the piece.

the text itself. the awkward atonal

on all other counts. At certain

Snyder appeared on 'l‘hursday.
April I? and gave it reading which
was sponsored by the Chinese
Studies Club. lntcrspcrsed with his
reading he spoke of Chinese in-
flucnccs on his poetry.

As a child Snyder lived in the
Pacific Northwest. He remembers
being unable to define the beauty of
the distant mountain landscape!-
thc Cascades. He remembers seeing
Westcnt art depicting this landscape
and feeling unfulfilled. Yet upon sec-
ing Chinese landscape paintings he
rccogni/cd his mountains of the

He mentions ’l'u-Fu of the Tang

Snyder was also inﬂuenced by
Chinese poetic style. He spoke ofthe
five and seven character lincsand the
song-like quality of Chinese verse.
He was so intrigued with this style
that he took on' the translation of
Hun-Shun. Snyder describes Han-
Shan its the "type of fellow that
would hang out at logging camps to-
day.“ llan-Shan was a poor man. a
crazy character. He lived alone ill a
place called Cold Mountain (litm-
Sltrut). He wrote poems on bamboo.
wood. stones. and cliffs. More than
three-hundred of these have been
found. At the reading Snyder read
some of his translations of llan-
Slum‘s poetry. l’rtilcssrtr'Clttrrtg then

vironmentalist he speaks for nature:
he seeks to misc men’s consciousness
about their land and. the ways by
which men can stop acting like new-

become natives of Turtle Island. '

In Snyder‘s “Tomorrow‘s Song,“
he tells us that a day will come soon
