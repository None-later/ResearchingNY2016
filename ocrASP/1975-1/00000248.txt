for the dinner. and for the awards
and music that were to follow.
Attending Were several faculty

After dessert, Dr. Ward swore in
next year‘s ISA ofﬁcers: President
John Stapleton (Ireland); Vice Pres.
Wing Keong Chan (Singapore);
secretary Atsi Atsain (Ivory Coast);
and treasurer Bill Collins (US).
Current president Enerio later
awarded certiﬁcates of appreciation
to Mrs. Ruth Spruck, directt of

Westervelt, assistant Dean to

Frank G. Carrino. director of Inter-

The awards ceremony lasted only
a short time. The tables and chairs
were cleared away and the remainder
of the evening was devoted to music
and dancing. The students (most of
the faculty had retreated by this
time) were treated to the evening‘s
highlight, Ruby. They were ex-
ccllent, one of the best dance bands
We‘ve ever seen. and everyone took
advantage of the opportunity to
dance until exhaustion.

Put in terms of time. exhaustion
occurred at about tchVc tltirty. at
which point the blind left but many
people stayed on to finish tip the
coffee and beer. For the ISA. it was
just another in a long series ofycarly
successes. As for us. well. it was in-
teresting, unusualuntl we had a great

Electronic Collage

' “:Of Sound and Light

by Glenn Verdi

Franklin Morris, the head of the
electronic music lab at Syracuse Un~
iversity, visited the Performing Arts
Center here last Thursday afternoon
and brought with him six of his
videoart works. The works were
presented in another of the Music
Department's “Free Music Store"
afternoon concerts. Morris‘ works
were kincscope films accompanied
by electronic music.

Mr. Morris attempted to explain
the technical end of his artwork
before he showed the films. He said
each work was filmed with a camera
placed in front of it TN. monitor.
The camera ﬁlmed all the wildly
abstract images Morris was able to
put into the 'l'.V. monitor using his
special effects generator. Each film
was made in this way, live and an-
edited. Whatcvcr happened on the
T.V. monitor was filmed. Morris
controlled the progression ofthe im-
ages to some extent with it 'I‘.V.
studio control board.

Once a film was cotnplctcd be
either composed IIII electronic music
soundtrack for it or mixed voices
anti other sounds together to forth a
sound collage backdrop for his
abstract video work.

Stopping between each of the six
works on the program. Morris told
of tltc special characteristics of each
specific liltn. ()nc film was a collagc
of slide pictures of things like lltc
Manhattan 'skyline. a box of sttlliuc
crackct‘s and the American flag. The
slides were |Il.‘illtptl§t.'tl and coin-
hincd with some special cllccls to
produce a colorfully artful visual es-
pct'icncc. fltc sound accoiupunying
thc lilut was engrossing electronic
music produced in Morris‘ syn-
thcsi/cr lab.

Attotltcr fihn was a political satire
of sorts. I'honglt vcry ahstractly
produced untl filmed. the images of
cx~l’rcsident Nixon came across
well. The sound bcliitttl lltcfiltti was
It combination of Nixon speeches,

The remainder of the works
Morris screened for the fifty of' us
assembled in the PAC Recital Hall
were strikingly colorful collages of
rapidly changing visual images. Dur-
ing these four films I could conceit-
trate more on the soundtrack which I
found intcrestingund different. Mr.
Morris said that he had little or no
concern for any continuity between
the sound and the visual images;
however, the sound seemed to fit tltc
visual images very well. I believe the
overall continuity of the audio and
visual aspects of each work lay in
their similar avant-gurde natttrc.
Since botlt the sound and the images
were basically abstract. they fit each
other rather naturally.

()n the whole, Mr. Morris‘ works
were refreshingly inventive attd
tastefully synthesized. They were as
well organixcd asany edited abstract

Morris creates the works totttlly live.

field are making more commercially-

us that hc will cotttinuc making his

as the studio costs don‘t become

Mr. Morris‘ art is the art of the
new movement in electronically

entenuiningly different from the
traditional art and music we see and
hear duy-to-dny. The music depart-

by Mllte I’Ieltardtl

"To arms! To arms!” No, the red-
coats aren‘t coming, but the Great
Dane varsity baseball pitching staff
is. And coming on strong.

“All the pitchers looked good."
said leftﬁelder Mike Gamage. com-
menting on the way the all-righty
Dane pitching staff handled theVer-
mont bats in the two-game scrim-
mage held here on Friday. The ﬁnal
scores show Vermont with a I-0 win
in the ﬁrst game and a H tie in the
second. But in scrimmages. it's not
whether you win or lose, it‘s how you
play the game.

Coach Bob Burlingamc purposely
used all six of his pitchers in the two
seven-inning contests to keep the
arms well-oiled in anticipation ofthe
upcoming games with Hartwick and
Colgtttc.

.loltn Dollard started the opening
game and allowed only one run in his
five frames ofwork. Unfortunately,
his Vermont rivals did not allow any

stalled. But Dollard's pitching per-
formance was the encouraging news.

Dollard “looked sharp again."
said the coach. and conceded that
the strong sophomore Would open
today‘s game against Hartwiclt. “He
(Dollard) might even go Saturday if
he looks good out there on Tuesday
(today)."

Dollard is now coming off two
strong pitching performances in a
row. Besides his work on Friday, he
turned in a masterful ﬁve-hitter last
Saturday against Cortland in win-
ning 2-1. In that contest, he picked.
up eight strikeouts in seven innings,
while not allowinga hit over the final
three.

Burlingame. obvioust pleased.
said, “He looks the best (of the staff)
right now."

Relieving Dollard in that first
scrimmage game was relief ace Bob
K ronen bergcr. K rone pitched
scoreless ball over the final two
frames and continues to impress. His
only subpar effort of the season
came in last week‘s Siena tilt when he
contributed heavily to the Dane's 7-2
loss in the ninth.

Rick Okoniewski started in the se-

cond game of the Vermont scrim- .

magc and threw fairly well in his two
innings. His arm bothered him
slightly but it was understandable
because the hard—throwing righty
had pitched eight plus innings on
Tuesday.

Tom Blairalso pitched two frames
worth in that second pine and gave
up the only Vermont tally by walk-
ing in a run. Bhir is the number two
starter in Burlingame's mound'corps
right now. but may be in jeopardy
because of a bidding Glenn
Sowalskie.

Sowalsltie pitched two ﬁne in-
nings oanriday and looked good in
his only start last week in a winning
effort against RPI. “If Glenn comes
on, he can take Bhir‘s place." mused
Burlingame. Blair, incidentally. is a
converted inﬁelder from the fall
campaign. His forte is hitting and is
one of the Dane's “big three” hitters
along with Vie Giulianelli and Jay
Milauskas.

Possible Starter

If Sowalskie can produce,
Burlingame hopes that will free Blair
for full-time hitting duty. Sowalsltie
is also a possible starter in Satur-
day‘s home doubleheader and it
could be his big opportunity to take
over the number two job behind
Dollard.

.lim Willoughby saw limited ac-

tion in the Vermont scrimmage but
turned in a scoreless inning ofwork.
Willoughby is the "emergency"
pitcher.whcn not seeing third base
duty. 5“},
All in all. themséllimage showed
Albany‘s pitching staff is capable of
bigger and better things. Now We‘ll
just have to see how‘much better.
