Tommy’s Rebirtbf
.. See it......

Director Keri Russell has taken the Who‘s eight year old rock opera. Tommy. and beaten.
stretched. exaggerated, torn apart. and put it back together in his own cockeycd way.

The rcsultsarc cffectivcas entertainment on it large scale. although much ol'thc meaning ofthe
piece has been lost through the many changes and many years. When Tommy first appeared it
was taken as proof that rock could be rcspcctablc. undthe story ofti Messiah who brought the
truth packaged in ii pinball machine was part ofthc religious movement of many young people of
the late Sixties. Today there arc no grcttt movements. rind most oftbc young have sunken into
apathy. Since Tammy has only been made into a film. its old meaning is lost. and only the
sensory delights of ﬂashy cinema and hard hitting rock music are left.

Russell‘s very heavy handed tiltcmpt tit ti stttirc ol'Christianity includes crosses with pinballs
iitop thcm. rcbirths rind baptisms in thc occttn. it blccding Tommy purtcturcd by rtccdlc wounds.
and walks on writer. Apparently iifrtiid tlitit 'l‘u/ttmﬁr audicncc would not ctitch the subtle
imiigcry. Russell threw in everything ltc could find.

By the time of the Sally Simpson scene Tommy is a full-fledged Munich. wrapped up in his
own image. but much more in touch with reality than he was earlier. When the ydung Tommy
goes on the “Amazing Journey.“ he is retreating into his own fantasy world where he shdotI
down model airplanes with his'real father. a pilot in World War ll; ﬂies out into outer space. and
sees giant silver balls.

Other characters in the movie retreat into fantasy worlds. and there are so many surreal scenes.
