at each other and smiled—how
typical! Only she would start a icon-
cert this way.

Finally the curtain opened on a
scene on the Mississippi. with a
Black chorus singing “Old Man

With their catch, they ﬁnd a gigantic
clam shell. it opens and reveals—
Bette Midler. This was the Clemson
the Half Shell Revue, startingthe
Divine Miss M. The screams and
applause were deafeninganddrown-
ed out her first song. Her
background group, the Harlcttes,
were dressed in mermaid outﬁts. The
scene was complete.

ltwaslittlewondcrtomethenthat
she sold out all her shows, even to
her extended run. But who is Bette
Midlerand how did she get to where
she is today? The answer is: She was
born a Hawaiian Jewish Princess,
who played in suclt shows as
Cinderella It’evlitirletl, Salvation.
and Fiddler on the .It’ouf. all on
Broadway But Miss M‘s rise to
sttpcrstardom began in i97l, when
she began as a solo artist in New
York‘s Continental Baths. a guy bath
and discotheque, where rising talents
come to “show their wares.“ From
there she went to a Philharmonic
Hall concert, and finally to the

.‘ the last concertes'he ,did until now.
She played an unprecedented run in
the, Palaee,arid now is breaking her
previous '-record, .with all perfor~
manees completely sold out.

“You got a year off, and now you
are going to pay,” the said to her
audience. By the end, we paid, all
right. We were absolutely exhausted.
She-is infectious, we got her “bug,”
but wedidn'thaveMin M's stamina,

Divine Miss M".

and we were dead by the end of the
concert. She, though, had still
enough energy to go through a later
show (from Thursday to Sunday, she
does two shows a night!)

One has to admit that Bette
Midler gives her audience a show.
She plays to and for her audience.
Her jokes are alldigs at various peo-
ple, famous, infamous, orotherwise.
No one, not Nixon, Ford, Olivia
Newton-John, Barbra Streisand,
straights, gays, men or women are
safe from the barbs she throws.
“Sparking of sugar, take Olivia
Newton-John. The ﬁrst time I heard
of her, I thought she was a phar-
macetttical company.“ But i
digress....Her voice was not in top
shape. though. She sounded slightly
hoarse in the softer numbers. which
lent them a sort of lurid sexuality. In
her big, loud songs. site was prefec-
tion. llcr singing style laces songs
with sensuality and a definite sexual
flavor, not unlike the style of Tina
Turner. but tnore refined.

The ﬁnale for the first act is even
crazier. Bette is seen in a window ,
getting ready for bed. singing
“Wishing for the ()ne i Love.“ The
llarlettes tap to "Lullaby of

The opening of the second act was
breathtaking. The curtain rises to

A MosimAmazing ‘ I 

In antiquity, legends of miraculous conception, birth,
or childhood exploits readily attached themselves to the
records of those who as adults accomplished great deeds
or occupied high positions. This was certainly true of the
Greek hero Heracles. His mother Alcmena and her hus-
band Amphitryon, king ofTiryns. were living as exiles in
l'hcbes. While Amphitryon was away on a military cam-
paign Alcmcna‘s beauty was noticed by Zeus, who chose
her for the last ofhis mortal concubincs and desired to
tank c her the mother of a great hero. Assuming the form
of Amphitryon Zeus visited Alcmena and satisﬁed his
desire. That same night. or perhaps the following night,
the real Amphitryon returned from his campaign and
also slept with Alcmcna. Thus Alcmena conceived twin
boys by different fathers. '

"Heracles" means “glory of Hera.” but Hera was
H craclcs‘ implacable enemy. The jealous consort of Zeus
persecuted Heracles rclcntlcssly,cvcn before his birth. in

fact she tried to prevent the birth of the twins but was not

successful in this effort: Alcmena delivered the boys. and

they were named Heracles and lphicles. When the boys

were about eight months old. Hera placed two serpents
in their chamber one night. lphicles noticed them ﬁrst

and screamed. lleraclescalmly seized one serpent in each

hand and strangled them both, before Alcmena and

Amphitryon rushed into the chamber. Now it was

perfectly clear which boy was the son of Zeus and which ‘
the son of Amphitryon. 0f the many dragon slayers in

classical mythology (Zeus, Apollo, Jason) and in non-

classiail mythology (Siegfried, St. George). llcracles is

certainly the youngest.

The deeds of Heracles, both the fatnous Twelve
Labors and other exploits, have been represented in
countless works ofart. both ancient and later, The baby
Heracles strangling the serpents is seen in some coins
issued by the Greek city ofCroton in southern Italy, in a
licllenistic sculpture. and in a i’ompcian wallpainting.

Lena’s Cafe Swings
With Bluegrass Music

by George 'l'ohjy

The sign announcing "Frank
Wakefield and Friends“ wasn‘t the
cause of the sell-out crowd and
numerous reservation hassles last
Monday night at Saratoga‘s Cafe
Lena. The Friends had been
previously advertised as John Daw-
son, lead vocalist and songwriter,
and David Nelson. lead guitarist of
the New Riders of the Purple Sage.
They were such an integral part of
the billing that Lelia postponed the
show fora week toaccomodatethcir
recording schedules.

Marmaduke (John Dawson), the
crowd favorilcioi' the R idcrs. was the
obvious reason for the excitement at
Lena‘s boforc the show.

Frank Wakefield anti the Good
Old Boys took the stage con—
spieuousiy minus Marmaduke. Lena
said he was sick; Nelson said he was
“busydoingsontethinglikcwatching
television.“ The band however
quickly made the crowd forch Mar-
maduke with “Bluegrass
Breakdown“ showing off the ill-
dividual talents of Wakefield (man-
dolin). Nelson (acoustic guitar),
Tom Stcarnsibanjo), and a stand-up
bass player frotn Banjo Dan and the
Midnight l’ioughboys. With “Ashes
of Love" frotn limjo, Nelson proved
he was more titan just the other

Riders songs like "Crooked Judge."
"Dim Lights. Thick Smoke." "She‘s
No Angel.“ "Panama Red." “(ilcn~

Eyes." all of which he sang during
the three hour show. The country
background which Buddy Cage‘s
steel guitar provides for the Riders
was replaced by Stcarns excellent
banjo leads giving these songs a new
bluegrass style.
