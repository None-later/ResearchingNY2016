_' Huber - Karpav? Not Quite I  I

by Jason “The Flying Rook”llraun
Last month, the chess world was
very disappointed to learn of
Fischer's refusal to play Karpov for
the World Chess Title. However. so
as to not let chess people down on-
tirely. Brian Green. a l974 graduate
of SUNYA. and ldccided to play a
match. Though the quality of the
games will be slightly lower than a
Fischer-Karpov match. the fighting
spirit is there, as shown by the
following game. our first.

The opening was characterized by
White's ingenious piece sacriﬁce.
Black had the choice of keeping the
material to go into an inferior
endgame. (actually :i middlegante
without queens). Black‘s counterat-
tack resulted in a drawn position.
However. Wltitc used tip too much
time and his flag fell three moves
before the time control of 40 moves
in two hours.

Tricks and Trumps

Consider the action to take on the
following hands when it is your turn

to bid. In each case you are Souli.

As Sotitli. vulnerable, you hold:

What is your bid after:

Even though your hand is Worth
It) points plus l for distribution. a
Pass is the proper cull. Despite the
ﬁne texture of the heart suit. you
could end tip in trouble at the two
level. especially vulnerable. even it
partner shows tip with a decent
hand. if partner is kind enough to
have a hand such as:

'. Qxx

your Cottlmcl is slated to fail by iit
least one. very possibly two tricks;
this is assuming partner produces
these I l points. Of course. partner.
with the same number of points.
could have:

.xxx
0 Axx
o Kxx
O Axxx.

which is a much better hand. In this
case. 2 Hearts would iniike exactly;
btit then. there is not reason to
assume partner does have this
strength.

l’ui‘tncr‘s 4N'l' was not
liliiekwootl. the Aceaskiiigbid. This
type of bid is called a quantitative
misc iii No'l rump. it merely asksthe
original No’l'rtimp bidder to bid the
small no trump slam il'hc has the top
ol his bid. atid to Pass if not.

That is why ii is hard to see that
despite only to points. a Pass is not
the correct bid. Here it is important
to see the “trees to i' the forest." True.
there are only in pis.. but theyare a
"good" to pts. “Good” points here
consist of Aces and Kings. when
looking for slums, and such hands
should always be revuliied upward.

there is another. yet subtle.
reason lor raising to six no trump.
Since partner failed to inquire about
4 card majors. via the Stiiyniuii con—
vention. it is stile to tissuiiie he. too.
liiis none. 'liicrcfore,all his values
should be ill the minors. where yours
are too! o No 'l'rump is the winner if
partner‘s hand is something like:

agreed upon by the partnership. to

4N'l’ is quantitative: but in these two
cases 4N’l is definitely not
lilaiekwood. One final pointithe
quantitative 4N'l‘ bidder tisually has
IS-lti points.)

As South you hold:

l) void
C KJiU4

What is your opening bid‘.’

This hand is two shades short of a
demand hid. ie.; a strong-two. To
produce game of any kind. your
partner must be able to "fit" with
your hand. in other words it is very
likely that partner‘s points are
predominantly in diamonds 7- KQJ
(xx). ll'so, they will he uselessto you
unless he also has a few outside en-
tries. The best bid is l Spade.
