by Space Reggio
and Matt Kaufman
When Andy Warhol's Exploding

Plastic Inevitable hit New York, it.
was immediately hailed as the ul- V

timate in multi-media experience. a
psychedelic three ring circus. In the
center ring. of course, The Velvet
Underground. And at the center of
The Velvet Underground was Lou
Reed. '

As songwriter and vocalist. Reed
set the styleof the group—a brand of
decadent morbidity made
fashionable by Warhol in his artistic
and social endeavors. There were
songs like “Heroin” that earned him
the instant rejection of music critics
across the nation:

When I'm rushng on my run

And I feel just like Icsus' son...

When I put a spike into my vein

Then I'll tell you things aren't

quite the same ‘
But there are also cuts like “Sweet
Jane.” “Rock and Roll“ and “White
Light/White Heat“ that have
become rock classics, that show Lou
Reed as just another driving rocker
with some strange ideas about lyrics
and vol styles.

For a while there was a depres-
sion. a self-imposed exile after the
disintegration of the Velvcts. Then.
under the guidance. prodding and
production of David Bowie and
Mick Ronson. Lou Reed re—cmerged
with a hit single, “Walk on the Wild
Side,“ and a solo album,

 Cemeraatg

Transformer. Working once again at
full steam, he‘s released live albums
since then. Among them Berlin is
probably his best work. rc-
establishinghim asa creative force in
rock.

If his two live albums are any in-
dication, Reed gives a consistent
fast-moving show. He‘s assembled a
new group of musicians for his pre-

P-----

sent tour—Doug Yule. Bruce Yaw.
Martin-Fogel. MichaelSuchorsky—
and will be doing two shows here at
SUNYA on May 2, With String
Driven Thing. Watch the ASP for
details on ticket sales.

If the shock of moving from Felt
Forum to Campus Center Ballroom
isn't too great. we’re in for a good
show.

‘ "Diner Pro 'de" ‘Gate 
by Melte- Ceuet m
and Sandy Ellenbogm
The Gateway Diner. located on
Central Avenue at Colvin, is the
perfect example of what a diner
I should be. The long hours and fast
service make it comparable to a
truckstop. The friendly service is
of a neighborhood
luncheonette and the excellent food
and baked goods make it worth the
out of the way trek.
The comprehensive menu encom-

passes simple short order cooking as
well as traditional restaurant fare.
Since both arrive at your table in
short order, the full-ﬂedged meals
suffer from lack of attention.
Reef Special

Gateway features specials which
vary from day to day. The Old
Fashioned Beef Stew ($2.90) com-
bincs tasty. well cooked meat and
carrots with. unfortunately, canned
potatoes and string beans in gravy
which is also probably canned. The

stew is sewed with rolls, butter. and
a green salad drenched with bottled
dressing.

The fresh ham ($3.30) was lean.
tender, and pleasantly ﬂavored.
Both the ham and the gravy which
covered it. however. lacked distinc-
tion. The accompanying dressing
was poor. A watery blob of canned
spinach and a thimble full of
applesauce completed the dish.
along with a portion of excellent
home-fries.

The quality of the home-fries is
typical of the short order cooking.
An outstanding and novel prepara-
tion is French Toast made with two
slices of “challah”. a rich. braided
bread made with eggs (95¢). It is
served with butter and Kraft “Table
Syrup“. so named because it con-
tains absolutely no maple syrup. The
cost of French Toast is hiked to
$2.10 with_the addition of a small
bowl ofcanned blueberries: hardly a
worthwhile investment.

Eggs (90c for two eggs. any style)
are a good choice. especially when
combined with ham ($3.25). orstcak
(S4.65).The ham and eggs. for exam-
ple. in addition to two eggs and
toast. comes with the home-friesand
a generous portion of charcoal
broiled ham. whose smokey flavor
greatly enhances the dish.

Other items of note include three
cheese hlinttcs with sour cream
($2.|()). and a Reuben sandwich
(S2.l5) consisting of gilled corned
beef. saucrkrautuand swiss cheese on
rye bread. (iatctvay‘s \crsions of
both of these are quite good. though
not up to the Clai.. .r ofthcir French
Toast. A quarter pound charcoal

Popular Desserts]
Desserts are Gateway’s forte.
Their recipe for cheese cake (80c)

seems to vary, but the result is in- .

variably delicious. The first time we
tried it. it was sweetand grainy. most

recently it was moist. smooth. and'

‘crcamy. Their huge strawberry tart
(85c) is great if you love French
cream. Their cream is not overly
sweet and was covered by large. ripe.
luscious strawberries. A yery pop-

ular item is the mammoth chocolate :
chip cookie (35c). which is cakier _

than Frcihofer‘s. the localbarometcr
for evaluating chocolate chip
cookies.

Gateway serves a full line of
pastries. ice cream puddings and
other desserts. 'l'hc grape nut and the
bread custard puddings (Site) are
both interesting and surprisingly
good.

l‘hc (iatcway Diner is open until 2
A M on wccknights and 24 hours a
day on weekends. The atmosphere is
hustling yct comfortable. It isan ex-
cellent choice for late night snacks
and breakfasts.
