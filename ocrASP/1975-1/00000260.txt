Problems? “We have been plagued
by bad weather.“ Saucrs continued.
“We also suffer from the problem
that golf is the sport which involves
missing the roost classes. as our
meets last several hours and our
practices also take time and must be
completed during the afternoons.
Thus. we are lucky to have the some
5 gollcrs for any match. and have
been using many different players as
our number 0 in tire meets."

For the record

In previous matches. Albany has
dclcalcd Utica and Hamilton, while
losing twice to Sicna (the team
Sauct's cited as “among the best in
the NCAA‘s L'ollcgc Division") and

University Cb-plonib

The team‘s next outing is in Buf-
falo on Saturday for the University

Albany has always taken. "Our
chances look dismal. especially with
Rudy Vido not making the trip (he‘ll
be It the Patriots camp) and one of
our best long jumpers. Tom Purdini
is hurt. but we can still win it.”
