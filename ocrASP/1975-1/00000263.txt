Comic V. Heroes  Threatened by Untimely

Will the Shadow fade forever?
Has Superman met his match? is
Buffalo Bill headed forthe last roun-
dup'! Will Tarzan be forgotten; Nick
Carter. Calamity Jane, Deadwood
Dick. The Black Avenger and all
their kin be lost to future
generations? Such is the dolcful
prospect unless something is done——
and done quickly—to halt the forces
of destruction now at work.

Not only the dime-novel heroes of
the |89()‘s and the early l900's, but—
more ominously—most of the
comic-book and pulp-magazine
protagonists of the I920‘s through
the l940‘s are threatened with an un-
timely death.

‘which .Superman originally

appeared) recently sold for “.800.

collectors but hard to find, even at
premium prices. include Weird
Tales, The Shadow, Doc Savage.

Besides collectors. many serious
students of Americana are concern-
ed over the threatened dis-

appearance of these pop-culture
books. There is. forexample. now‘ an

Association with 1,500 members.

representing 1,000 schools and un-
iversities throughout the United
States and Canada. And a Center for
the study of Popular Culture has
recently been established at Bowling
Green University. Bowling Green.
Ohio.

A number of colleges now feature
courses in pop culture. Michigan

State University currently offers two
such courses, in which students are
expected to read and analyze pulps
like The Shadow. Doc Savage and
The Phantom Deter/Ive. The univer-
sity library. however. just doesn‘t
have enough texts to satisfy class
needs.

Concerned over the imminent ex-
tinction of this important segment of
American folk literature. Xerox
Corporation is mounting a rescue
operation through one of its
operatingcompanies. Xerox Univer-

sity Mieroﬁlm's. Located at Ann Ar-
bor. Michigan. XUM" he ‘ rld's

current periodicals. government
documents. newspapers and doc-
toral dissertations. as well as~more
than “0.000 out-of-print books of

The company right now is forging
