We might have grabbed you at a basketball game.
Or maybe in the library while you were studying.

It could be that one of your friends was in front of
our lenses when the shutter was pressed at a dance
sponsored by “Friends”. One way _or anotherawe
managed to get a lot of people’s pictures in this
year’s TORCH.

So when you get your yearbook on Monday, tear
into it Leaf through it like everyone else does to
see if you or your friends are in there. But after
that. sit down with the book. It’ll take about a half
hour to read from cover to cover.

Check out the end sheets, front and back (the ’re

.zznot the same). Then read it through. Check t e

photos on pages 82 and 83 (they’re not the same
either). ‘

TORCH 75 has attempted to capture and interpret
the past year at SUNYA. Check it out. It’s a

book to think about.

It may be the only book ever written about you.

The TORCH will be in selling on Monday, Mav 5 at
10:00 am. We’ll sel until we run out of books or
4:00 arrives.

With two tax cards (one from each semester) it’ll
cost one dollar. If you’ve lost one of your tax cards

Several decisions were made at
Wednesday's Central Council
meeting that will directly affect
students. One concerns the approval
of spending $675 for beer parties in
front of the Campus Center on sun-
ny days (8 days are included inthe
$675). This idea was first proposed
by Jon Martin and Lew Fidler.

Another bill. reducing the price of
the Torch. for students with both.
semesters' tax cards to $l.00 instead
of $l.50. was passed. l7-2-2. Note:
Seniors only will be allowed to

purchase a Torch on Monday.

Three hundred and ten dollars was
alloetted to cover the cost of charter-
ing and advertising for late weekend
night buses for the rest of the
semester.

The turnout for the elections so
far. has been “exceptionally good.“
according to Elections Com-
missioner Kelvin Dowd. There wasn
slight problem with running out of
ballots. but that has now been
alleviated.

In case you haven‘t heard. Com-
mander Cody. Batdorf and Rodney.

The New York Public Interest
Research Group. Inc. (NYPIRG)
recently urged the Senate Com-
mittee on Election Law to make a
commitment to working for the in-
stitution of total public financing of
state elections. Nancy Kramer.
NYPIRG staff attorney. told the
committee. at a hearing held in New
York City. that total public sub-
sidization of state campaigns is the
only solution to the campaign ﬁnan-
cing ills that have plagued New York
and other states. Afterdiscussing the
problems of the current system, she
said:

Any ststem that allows private
contributions has a major fun-
da mental drawback which no
amount of exquisitely careful draf-
ting or full and fairenforcemcnt can
overcome. It gives a greater say in
the electoral process to those who
have wealth or access to wealth.
And. in so doing it makes our public
officials beholden to those people
who have made it possible for them
to reach public office. Therefore. a
system based on private cori-
tributions is an inherrently unfair
system—~no matter how well-
dcsigncd and administered.

own public financing bill. Highlights
of the bill include:

Before drafting this bill.
NYI’IRG‘s legal staff evaluated the

cluded that it was ne‘cﬁo‘sstirIyto go

proposed. which. if. er‘ﬁi’cted could

explained.
