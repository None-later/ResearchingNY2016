This was Michal Urbaniak‘s Fu-
sion, presented by R.P.l. on Friday,
April 25, I975. Urbaniak‘s music is.
to say the least, unique. Some of his
intricate compositions are written
in such‘ off-beat meters as seven
beats per measure. Urban‘iak‘s

_ proficiency with the electric violin is

indeed impressive and adds ﬂavor to

drove the audience wild. At the end
of the number, Dudziak was
showered with thunderous applause
and shouts for more.

accented voice. Few listeners un-

“ Can't Beat the’ltﬂ - John Hammond

'John Hammond always seems to
be around. He shows up at the
Shaeffer Music Festival in New
York City every summer, playing his
dobro guitar and warming up a
Focus or Mahavishnu Orchestra
crowd. The people there try to turn
him off. but hejust sits thereblowing
his harp, stomping his foot. and
grabbing peoples' attention.

The second side of his new album,
Can't Beat The Kid. contains that
type of musiﬁsolo blues,with onlya
guitar. harp, and a foot for backup.
This sets John Hammond off from
other blues musicians. Almost all
other blues interpreters rely on elec~
tric guitars, loud instrumentation.
and female vocalists. Hammond
relies on the blues. With him. the
words stand out, and reach the
listener. In Robert Johnson‘s
“Terraplane Blues". he sings. “When
I mash down on your starter. your
sparkplugs will give me lire.“ He
keeps it really simple, but effective.

Whereas his guitar playing is effec-
tive, his harmonica is superb. It is the
most distinctive sound on the album,
especially on side one. where he has a
backup band—-bass. piano and
drums. “I Hate to See You Go,“ and
"Help Me." are memorable for their
hiinnonica breaks. They tremble and
wail, and plead for his woman to
stay.

The other songs on side one are
not memorable. Their arrangements
are uninteresting. the chorded guitar
riffs are boring, and his vocals seem
desultory. On the other hand, side
two‘s vocals are animated and ex-
pressive. Without the backup
musicians Hammond has to work
harder and the effort shows. His
“Statesboro Blues" is fast and jum-
py, original despite the many recor-
dings of it.

Hammond invites the listener in

The 70‘s may well be the age of
ethnic pride—witness sucn courses
at the university as “Italian Studies."
“Puerto Rican Studies,"and "Judaic
Studies," new additions . to the
curriculum of academia. And while
over-emphasis of one's culture can
be dangerous (if it leads to hostility
or a sense of false worth) and often
creates what Kurt Vonnegut calls a
granfaI/oon (a group of people who
merely think they have something in
common because of the accidents of
birth, time or place), it is
nevertheless fascinating and moving

use the term “pub” because it‘sabout
as close as you can come to one

because it has Guinness on tap, oran
overabundance of Gaelic blessings
