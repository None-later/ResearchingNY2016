After four games, my match with
Brian Green now stands at one win
each with two draws. There have
been many mistakes by both sides
but the games have been anything
but peaceful!

After the English Opening of the
second game, White had a nice lead
in development which resulted in the
win of a pawn. However, I made two
weak moves and material was once
again evened. Though Black tried to
complicate the position in White's
time pressu re, the ﬁnal position was
a drnw.

about his QB pawn so much. C)
Black spent 30 minutes on this move

in. But what else is there'l'.’ d) Lust
week I said there is no rush to cap-
turc weuk pawns! Much stronger
was 17. R-N I! which eventually con-
lrols the QN files while keeping the
QB pawn under fire. c) A pointless
move which leaves the knight un—
