In concert, the musical repertoire
of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of
Invention is seeminglylimitless; they
appear to’ have enough material to
perform for several weeks straight

without repetition. Their music
ranges from lyrical narrative to pure
instrumental. but when it entries to
college performances Zappa has'
always put aside his better known
pieces for more experimental
musical forms. as be illustrated Inst

week to a full house at the Palace.

Experimental is not necessarily
better. though. The show was
interesting—and "interesting" is

Gertrude Stein‘s single qualification r t  '

for determining whether or not
something is worthwhile—but the
concert could have been much
better. At times the music slipped
from free-form into slush. Sickness
was partially to blame; Zappa and
several members of the band
reportedly almost fell off the stage at
the end of the show.

Things started ol'fwith a free-form
jam. involving some strange
pulsating lighting effects. as a
manner of introduction for the
members of the band: Bruce Fowler
on trombone. Terry Vozio on
drums. George Duke on keyboards.
’I‘om Fowler on bass. Napoleon
Murphy Brock on lead vocals rind
saxcs‘. Denny thllcy on rhythm
guitar. Cupt. licelhcart on hair-
monica and vocals. and Frank Zap-
pa on lead guitar. vocals and low
grumblcs.

Throughout the rest of the con-

cert. the group continued in the same '—

fashion. relying on instrumentals

and solos rather than the more pop-
ular narrative. Playing only a hand-
ful of vouil numbers. the group then
vcnturcd off into morc'unorthodox
musical ground. a move that unfor-
tunately evoked complaints from
liitlny in the audience. and snorcs
from several others.

On lead guitar Zappa presented
himself as quite fluent. accurate and
intelligent. A recurring criticism of
Zappa's musicianship is that he
doesn't seem to be trying. and this
was the case at the Palace. Zappa.

could have been much better.

George Duke showed a great,

desire to “fiddle about" on
keyboards. at times successfully but
more often not. In comparison with
the many keyboardists who have
played with Zappa in the past. or
even in comparison with any ofthe
keyboard mcn performing in rock
right now. Duke does not emerge

favorable. .,

It was a big su rprisc to see Walley
on rhythm guitar. It‘s not often that
Zappa will even permit another
guitarist on stage. and for him to
throw a few leads (mainly slide) to
Wulley was even rarer.

Capt. Beetheart‘. who Joined the
tour after it had startcd. injected
some hdinofiinibfthc‘yl'angely un-
Zappa-likc seriousness of the show
with his spirited harmonica and his
energetic darlings about the stage.

l'hc music itself: while not what
most people think- was standard
Zappa lure. exuded am air that im-
mediately and definitely informed
the illltllchC that this was The
Mothers of Invention.

The main set was unusually
short also attributable to
sickness -»but the audience brought
them back on stage with a standing
ovation. and Zappa and the Mothers
kept them on their feet with an ex-
cellent rendition of "Willie the
l’imp“. one ol'Zappa‘s more popular
numbers. It looked like Zappa and
Co. had finally woken up. the con-
ccrt seemed like it was really ready to
move but after "Willie the l’imp"
they walked off stage and only the
return ol the house lights were able
to quiet the audience down.

All in zillan interesting experience.
but one that gave proof of Zuppu's
potential rather than of'his ability.
