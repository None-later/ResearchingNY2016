 University of '_ Massachusetts--
defeated Albany‘s tennis team for?
the'seeond year in a row as State loit
15-4 on Tuesday. The defeat ended.

 
 
 

Albany‘s'dual match winning streak
at ten.” ‘

Coach Bob Lewis called the two
teams “evenly competitive." The
close scores of ﬁve of the six-singles
matche's: support his statement.
Albany ill Joe Kestcnbaum lost to
Chris Post of Massachusettsb—i;6-2.
Freshman Mitch Sandler, Albany's

#2 singles player, lost to Bill Karolo- '

3, 7-6. Bob Diskin, Albany‘s #3, lost
to Barnaby Kulan in three sets, the
scores being 6-2. 3-6, 6-2.
Massachusetts‘s Marc Oullet
triumphed over #4 .Ion Weinberg 6-
4. 6-4 while Arthur Cloutier downed
irS Josh 'Connell l-fi. 6-2 6-4.
Albany‘s only singles win came as #6
Leo Stemlicht beat Kevin Gerrihan
of Massachusetts 6-0. 6-7, 6-].

. ‘ Lewis Unhappy

Coach Lewis seemed perturbed
aftenvards. "They weren't that much
better than we," he said, “but they
won the important points when they
had to. and we didn't." He added
that although his players haven‘t
changed since the fall season, their
patterns of play have. “We won the
big points in the fall. and so far we
haven‘t in the spring. I don‘t know
why."

Hopefully, Coach Lewis and his
team will find the answer by this
afternoon, when they play
I’Iattsburgh State here. Starting time
is 3 pm.

The junior varsity tennis team also
played Tuesday. and they defeated
Cableskill 6-3.

There are 289 athletes entered by the
ten teams in the l7eventsthatwill be
run, a very large number fora one-
day meet.

Last year's champion.Brockport,
will be led by senior Mark
Lineweaver, who is entered in twelve
events. His time in the hundred, 9.9,
ties Plattsburgh's Harold Horton for
the top speed in that event.

Cortland‘s Mike Lawry
checks in with the best time in the
220, 22.2, but is followed by two
Plattsburgh runners, GaryGillisand
Harold Horton, both of whom have
run 22.3‘5. Paul Kirchoff, also of
Cortland, has an impressive 49.0 in
the 440 leadingGillisof Plattsburgh.
Anthony Haslam of Piattsburgh
and Tom Painting of Buffalo are the
class in the 880. Fredonia is strong in
the discus with Fred Siegler (l60’5')
and .loel Villani (l43'8') pacing the
field. Long jumpers Barry Crawford
of Plattsburgh with ajump of22'l l"

Albany Coach Munsey feels the
competition in the mile arul three

runners Br‘nn Davis and Carlo

Cortland‘s Marvin Wilson are the
favorites in the three mile and
Wilson. Plattsburgh‘s Bruce Tongue
(who won both the mile and Ithe
three mile here two weeks ago)and
Buffalo‘s Tom Painting are favored
in the mile.

Albany's Roger Phillips and
David Cole are the fourth and ﬁfth
seeds in the 440 yard intermediate
hurdles, behind Ron Cameron of
Plattsburgh (who‘s time of 54.8 is in-
credible). Cortland‘s Kirchoff and
Oneonta's Pierce. Perry Hoeltzell's
throw of l76'l0" places him second
in the javclin behind Brockport‘s
amazing Lineweaver. Albany‘s
strongest events, though. are the l20
high gurdlcs and the shot put.

.lim Pollard, Stew Finton. and
Dave Cole are number one-three-

great strength there. In the shot put.
