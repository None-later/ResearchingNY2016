- ‘fHow‘ oes tobacco smoke affect
you'lTItte was the title of a question-
naire which was randomly circulated
to approximately l000 SUNYA
students last week. Surprisineg
enough, it was met with tolerance
and even enthusiasm, two emotions
which surveys rarely elicit. Out of the
thousand questionnaires dis-
tributed. 766 were returned.

legitimately answered, to the'

originators of the survey. The survey
was conducted by a group of six
students who had been workingon it
as a term long project for a group
communitions class.

The assignment was to research a
problem (preferably within the
realm of University life) and. from
collected data. draw a feasible solu-
'tion. This group chose to document
the need to eliminate public smoking
in specified areas on campuses in
New York State by determining to
what extent the health and well—
being of individuals is affected by
tobacco smoke which surrounds
them in classrooms and lecture
centers. They were advised by
various representatives from anti-
smoking organirations as to how to
conduct the project. A Mr. Svenson
from a local “rights for non-
smokers” group called "Ash." ad-
vised the student group to approach
the project from a health and safety
aspect. Mr. Svenson is alsoafliliatcd

with the Albany. Board of Health
and hopes to use the results of the
survey as part of his lobbying cam-
paign for a bill. now up in the State
Senate. restricting smoking in
various public places. The president
of “Gasp” (a Long Island based
group advocating the rights of non-
smokers) aided in the formulation of
survey questions. most of which in:
volved a direct line (yes. no
sometimes) kind ofanswerand were
keyed towards health detriment.
The results ofthe survey proved to
be informative and. on the whole.
rather interesting. Out of the 766
questionnaires returned. 63% were
non—smokers (this includes people
who have quit) and 37% were
smokers. Forboth smokersand non-
smokers. irritation of eyes was the
mostdisturbingand widely felt effect
of tobacco. Coughing was deemed.
by 75% of the non-smokers. as the
second evil. 589ml the smokers felt
that second place belonged to the
negative effects of tobacco on a cold.
The smallest percentage became ner-
vous and angry or rude to smokers.
The great majority of those who did
were non-smokers.The responsctoa

kind of tobacco (pipe. cigar.
cigarette) was the most irritation.

“’Wnbther campaign discrepancy

tion literature. According to sources
who asked not to be identiﬁed. stu-
dent funds and SA privileges were
used to xerox some campaign
material.

Besides these inconsistancics in
the election. candidates expressed
their concern overtbe ethics and per-

linisher in the presidential contest,
said that the campaign “would have

Runner-up Wax feclsthat “political
deals and haggling“ have no “place
in any elections. purlit-ularlr in stu-
dent government elections."

Vice Presidenbelcct Rick Meckler
stated: “Unfortunately. on a campus
this size. name recognition is often

enough to win. and if issues aren‘t
brought out (mudslinging to some)
that most well known candidates
prior to the election. Ken Wax and
Jon Levcnson would have won."
chenson asserts. "I was really dis-
appointed that the campaign got so

Hauman termed his budgeting

placing an emphasis on "starting

ing to try to steal itaway with an un-
fair election law. I congratulate him
and wish him the best."

were most irritated by cigarette
smoke.

Perhaps the most crucial points of
the survey were questions which
dealt with students” feelings about
restricting smoking in certain areas.
The majority of total respondents
did not want smoking completely
eliminated by 44% wanted it
restricted in some way. 53% of the
smokers would voice no objection to
restriction to a specific area in the
classroom or lecture center.
However, non-smokers do not seem
content with such a solution. Indeed.
65% would like to see smoking
eliminated within lecture centersand
classrooms. and would even like to
see all indoor smoking (i.c. campus
center. lectures. library. movies)
eliminated.

Whatever their expectations as to
the results ofthe first pan of the sur-
vey. the group expected the
"comments" section to yield the
most gratifying results. However.
they were rather disappointed at the
dearth ofideasput for remedyingthe
situation. The comments were. in
most cases. mundancly constructive.
though some were quite creative iit
terms of amusement. pungency and
absurdity. It was found. that thc
strongest antiamoking comments
came from former smokers.

One ambitious individual ven-
tured to convey his feelings through
a poetic effort;

Poor uld Fred

he smoked in [70!]

Ash es to Ashes!

T his piece was closed with an artistic
skull and crossboncs design. Others
from the non-smokers category
made seething references to the
"selfishness of smokers for th rcatcn-
trig the health of others."

However. one smoker stated:
“People who don't smoke should
always speak up.(prcferab|y polite-
ly). when annoyed by anothcr‘s
habitll“ A morcextremistand rather
perverse student had this to say:
"The right to smoke is a basic one to
mankind. The Ameriatn Indian,
(which you bureaucrats have all but
annihilated). smoked tobacco long
before the white mart arrived on
these shores. It was symbolic of
peace. If you Iive-ass.'honky. fatcat,
capitalists try to tell me not to
smoke. you can just forget about
peace."

Grievance Channels Listed
By the University Senate

by Randi B. Toler

Students who feel that they have
been unjustly graded by a professor
do have alternatives to turn to.
Grievance committces have always
been in existence in each of the
colleges of this University. but up to
now very few people have been
aware of this. The Undergraduate
Academic Council. one of the com-
mittccs formed by the University
Senate has started working to
change this predicament. Ira
Zimmerman. a member of the UAC.
hits sponsored a bill which called for
the schools to submit to the UAC the
name and address of the person to
whom a student may appcttl for a
change ol'rt grade. The U AC now has
the following list which they are
seeking to have published iit most of
the literature read by SUNYA

The subject of academicgrievance
committees was first brought up by
Mitch Kitsol‘f who proposed that the
Undergraduate Academic Council
set up a committee to hear student
grievances which would have the
power to change the grade ifthey felt
that the student‘s claim wasjustilied.
This proposal isnow being studied in
committee. In the mean time.

by David E. Romt'n .

Isaac Asimov began writing early. As he put it. “I
started reading science fiction when lwas nine. writing it
when l was eleven. Six years later it occurred to me to
write for money. and seven before I actually submitted

anything. It was another four months before I sold one.“
He got into an elite group known its First Fandom
because he had at letter published itt one of the sf pulps.
His first love Itusalwnys been sf. but he has expanded his
interests to include everything front hard science to
Shakespeare to the Bible. His itt least cursory knowledge
of almost everything. together with an ability to put his
thoughts in order quickly. has made ltim II very erudite
speaker.

It is partially because he speaks so well and so often
that I did not attend Itis speech Wednesday night. As
ntttclt as I like his writingnnd his speaking. I did not want
to frtcca large crowd fora lecture I probably have heard
most of before. and that I might hear more of litter. Un-
doubtedly it was interesting. but [didn‘t go. So this arti-
cle will not be on his speech. but on diverse personal
rcmcmbrnnccs.

The first time I ntct Isrtnc. IIS opposed tojust listening
to him. was Jan. 5. 1974. He was speaking at Orange
County Community College. located iit my home town
of Middletown. His conting then was slicer serendipity
because the very next day there was to be it convcittion in
NYC. Surely Isaac would g0. and I wanted to go. so
what further impetus did lnccd to risk Itiiit for a ridc'l He
gave his speech. which lived up to his usual informative
and witty standards. and tlteit went backstage. He talked
with adoring crowds. kissed several women. signed a few
autographs. and talked a little. I had cleverly left all my
Asimov books hontc and had absolutely itothing to talk
to Itim about. So I did what ldo best;hangingar0und.

Finally.th group broke up. As We walked to the cars I
stuck by Isaac. My gambit payed off when. about
halfway there. I discovered that everyone else but him
and me were engaged in conversation. Cashing in all my
chutzpalt ration coupons laskcd himfortt ride. I’olitcly,
he refused. I rcallydidn‘tcxpcct the ride. but it wasa nice
try.

Two days Iatcr.at the convention. IStI'ilC is once ttgain
speaking. Fttithfully. I am sitting three rows brick in the
center section. During the speech he rambles on about
his travelling. Hc rarely does any. and the last time he left
New York it was to Middletown. At tltc mention ofmy
home town I broke out irt large claps and boots of
recognition. lsuac looked around puulcd.
“Middletown'! Middletown‘.’ Someone here knows
Middletown‘!“ My hand shot up. As soon tIS Isaac saw
me an expression of utter disgust came over his face. as if
saying. "Oh no. not that brat again!“ Ever since then he
has remembered me. though I am ticvcr sure if he con-
nects my face to the incident.

Some of my friends have gone after Isaac with the
deliberate intention of leaving him speechless. He has
always managed to come tip with sortie sort of response,
but for the most part they succeeded.

At the I972 Lunrtcon. Ilcn Sitno exclaimed loudly.

,.._,

em... or . 

“Look. trim-s Isaac Asimov!“ Samuel Delatiey,.the_f_"

author behind Isaac. turned around and looked over his
shoulder to see who was being tallied about. Isaac chased
Ben out of the room. ' ‘ . s , _ ,3 "

Wendy Lindboe. former president of ASSFS'. is very
good at playing the naive. sweet young thing. Right after
Isaac had won the Hugo award for his novel. The Gods
’l‘ltemxe/vvs. she came up to him and said in a sugary
voice. “Oh. Dr. Asimov! I read your book. Are you ever
going to write another?“ He was flustcred. and merely
said. “You must be putting me on girlie.“

Isaac is known for his lecherous attitude. He likes to
kiss women. and makes no bones about it. I think his
fastest time was with RPl-studcnt Mary Martin. We
were at this year's Lurtacon. as was Isartc. Mary had been
wanting to meet himfor sometime because they lived in
tltc same town. Newton. Mitss..und never met there. At

Lurtrtcon. however. sltc sccmcd a bit reluctant. Isnid this '

was the perfect opportunity. grabbed her by the wrist.
and led Itcr to ltini. The sequence that followed Went too
first for me. I heard scraps of conversation such as. "I‘m
front Newton." "I used to live there.“ and the next thing I
knew she was fit his arms. getting kissed. Asimov ob-
vioust has the technique tvorkcd out perfectly. Incident-
Iy. Mary said she enjoyed the kiss.

A while ago the ASSFS planned to hold its own sfcon-
vcntion here on campus. It never came off. but in my
capacity as president Idid some ofthc preliminary work.
Getting it Guest of Honor (GoH) was the first on the
order of priorities. and to that end I sent a letter to
Harlan Ellison: "chould like to invite Isaac Asimov to
be Guest of Hottor but we feel his presence would make
the con too large. Would you be our GoH'r‘ Harlan
replied: "Much as I‘d love to come to your convention as
Guest of Honor. ltclping you to keep it small and sparse-
ly attended by my 'Honoruhlc I’rcscncc (its opposed to
Isaac's ttttendencc which would puff up your size) (and I
might mention that was a brilliant muster stroke of
diplomacy. telling a potential Guest of Honor he can‘t
draw flies). I‘ll have todcclinc the classy invitation. You
can‘t it I'lord me. I‘m sure the ‘number of other people un;
dcr corisidcrrttiott‘ will work cheaper...itrrd mighhlovcn
dritw lcssthitntt non-entity likcrnc. In short. Mr. Rottth
you have roughly its ntuch tact and classr—not immen-
tiott charm and grace r as an ax murderer suffering with
psycomotor epilepsy. Go away.“

So when Isaac was here last Wednesday. I brought it
up. Within a few sentences be interrupted. It seems
Harlan sent him a copy of my letter and his reply. He
described the letter he had sent to Marian about tItcinci:
dent. It wasn‘t tirttil later that I realized what Isaac had
done. He had taken HII'SIOI’)’.ZIII(I turned it ittto /Ii.\' story.
His ego is even larger than mine. which staggers the im-
rtgination.

Isaac Asimov is a very good. prolific writcrarid ti good
speaker. He is also a nice person. It is it great deal of fun
to listen to him. but it‘s almost as muclt fun listening to
stories about Itini. Do what Isitac docs and make some
up.
