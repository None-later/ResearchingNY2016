The Student Coalition for Educ-
ational and Cultural Freedom. com-
posed mainly of members ofFuerza
Latina. a Student Association-fund-
ed cultural group. staged a sit—in in
the SA office after Central Council's
final meeting ended enrlyThursdtiy.

Coalition members rnei after the
Council meeting when the Fuerza
Latina birdget was passed at $8.500
plus use of income and a rider on
Concert Board‘s budget insuring
tltcrn “at least one concert" to be ap-
proved by the Latin Group. A
spokesperson for Fuer‘m Latinnsnid
the purpose of thc Coalition's early—
morrtiiig rttcctirtg was to “evaluate
what conic down" in ithoiirtcilscs-
sion.

When the Council meeting ad-
iotirricd at about 2:00 um..Coiiliiioit
members rushed the SA office to
confront Council members on the
budget issue. The Coalition in-
di ‘iitcd that they were “discontent”
with Council's actions that night.

Several Council members

attempted to explain to the
protesters that Council had ad-
journed for the year and that
"nothing could bed one"about their
budget situation. Central Coun-
cilman David Coync urged other
Council members to “come to
Sutter‘s.“ while SA President-elect
Andy lkiuman agreed to talk with
the Fuerza Latina lender Tito
Melendez in the morning. “I'd love
to go ironic.“ remarked linuinan.
“and l‘m sure you all would too.”

Another Council member. Bob
O‘Brien. explained that the group
had gone twice before budget corn-
mittee and twice before Council.
O‘Brien added, “’l'hcrc’sno reason to
give them another hearing."

Following the dcpni‘tu rcol' all but
members of tltc coalition. the group
discussed tactics they would tinder-
take to furtltcr their cause. Mciitbers
were divided on whether or not to
stity the night. During a discussion
on the subject. friends were pltoited
to join the demonstration.

A depressed ML‘iClithI admitted
to the Coalition that he had "gool'cd“

 

during the presentation of their
argument to Council. A Coalitioncr
remarked. "Under pressure from
Central Council we compromised."

The demonstration continued
throughout iltc morning. Yesterday
afternoon a faction of the p rotestors
staged a brief rally in froitt of the
Campus Center similar to the one
held Wednesdayﬁfhe demonstrators
carried signs and chanted slogans
such as. “Support tltc Coalition.
we‘re supporting you' and “Cut the
birll. not the budget“ accompanied
by rhythmic clapping and Congas.

At yesterday‘s rally Melendez
commented. “'l‘hey‘rc afraid now.“
ridding that a two day sit~iii was
planned.

\ficr the Wednesday rally. n
iiicrtiiig of the coalition was ltcld in

strategies that might be used at that
evening‘s Central Council session.
