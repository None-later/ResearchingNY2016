The Peace Project of SUNYA,

NYPIRG and the Student GovErn-
men! of the Junior College of
Albany are sponsoring a sym-
posium, “on Energy Future: the
Nuclear Question“.
which will begin
tomorrow at to AM
in the lecture center
complex. Experts
(including industry persons)will ad-
dress various aspects of the question
in short prepared talks. A panel dis-
cussion. slide show and video tapes
will follow. .
' An extensive debate between
Ralph Nader and Norman
Rasmussen (Director of the
Rasmussen Reactor Safety Study)
will be shown on video tape.

A NYPIRG stuff laviyer will con-
duct a political workshop to discuss
pending legislation and means by
which people can become involved
in this important political process.

Analysis

Rate structures which provide
cheap electricity to large buyers
provide no incentive to industries to
use it efficiently, while residential
consumers subsidize the industrial
incflicicncy. Thee lcctrolytic produc-
tion ofttluminum for aluminum cans
(instead of‘thc recycling of retur-
nable bottles), for exam ple, results in
a tremendous waste ofencrgy, made
possible by the dirt—cheap rates that
aluminum companies rcceivc.

Promotion of all sorts of electric
devices and totally electric homes
has ensured rapid growth of residen-
tial consumption. The use of elec-
tricity for spaccand water heating is
an enormous waste of energy, sincc
conversion ofthctma lcncrgy to clcc-
tricity at the power plant and thc
rcconvcrsion ofclcctricity to heat in
the home has an efficiency of only
about 30% I

While the "energy crisis“ con-
trived by the oil com panics bus pass—
cd (with oil profits highcrthan cvcr),
tltc pattern of wild cncrgy consump-
tion and waste in our economy has
indeed plunged us into an energy
problem, although it is not one ofac-

tusl supply. Reliance on foreign oil .

supply, along with the general
economic malaise, has done serious
damage to the balanci‘ ofpa'yrnents
and economic position ofthe US. in
the world.

In light of this corporate powers

are now proposing as a solution that
the US. develop an “electric energy
economy", which itt addit'nn to in-
creasingthe power and proﬁts of the
electric utility companies, will waste
still more energy. Instead of oil, this
new economy will be fueled by coal
and that wonderful legtcy of the
artm race. nuclear power. '

Nuclear (fission) plants today '-

produce about 6% of the electric
power in the US. The scenario pro-
jected by the industry indicates that
electricity production will increase
its reliance on nuclear fission until
the tun ofthe centurywhcn itwillac—
count for around half of our
generating capacity. Nuclear fusion
or some other advanaad technology
will then begin to take over.

The prospect of a few hundred
nuclear power plants dotting the
country has alarmed many scientists
and environmentalists. The genera-
tion of electricity by nuclear ﬁssion
involves the use and production of
extremely toxic materials. the most
notable of which is plutonium,
which has a half-life of over 24,000
years and is one of the most potent
carcinogens known. These materials
mtist be contained from human or
environmental contact for many
thousands of years.

Critics of the industry have
qucstioncd the safety of the plants
themselves. as well as the reprocess-
ing and storage of wastes. The
credibility of thc govurttmcnt
r‘cgulatory agencies. safety of
workers in the industry, and the
ability of this extremely complex
technology (accom panicd by human
fallibility) to prevent rclcasc of toxic
materials into the cnvironm cnt. have
been challenged. The industry has
responded to the criticism with a
greatly stepped up public relations
campaign to encourage “public
acceptance“ of nuclear power.

The public has to accept a lot. The
“electric energy cconom y“ they are
being offered will become “a
plutonium economy." one in which
large quantities of this extremely
toxic material will be produced in

.“breeder' reactors“ (which will
‘probably'be much more dangerous

than‘ the reactors currerttly in use).
transported to reprocessing plants.
and then transported in purified
form to be reused as fuel.

There is presently not a single
operating'orprocessing plant in the
US. to handle wastes from nuclear
power plants. and about2300 tons of
waste are expected to accumulate
before one comes on line. A 6year.

$64 million engineering fiasco by the
General Electric Corporation gives
sorrtc indication if the technological
state of the proposed 'plutonium
economy.“ GE is considering scrap-
ping its entire MidWcst Fuel
Rccovcry Plant, which was original-
ly to have been completed in l970.
hccausc they simply have not been
able to make it work.lct alone work

Colleges

(CI’S) In order to  legal
pressures on college students, more
than [00 academic institutions have
begun programs offering low-cost
legal aid.

Such a program “allows students
to deal with it legal prohlcm witcn
tltcy have no knowlcdgc or rcsourccs
to pay an attorney.“ said Ohio st atc
rcp. Michael St inziano. who has in-
troduccd the latest legislation to
enable state colleges there to set up
their own independently-designed
lcgal service centers.

The University of Texas and the
Univcrstiy of Oregon were the first
institutions to form cxtcnsivc legal
aid programs. Counsclors at both
universities have said landlord-

Solar collectors can provide up to
