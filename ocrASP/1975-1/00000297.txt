vaders were made by the ally he was
relying on. A sense of betrayal ﬁlled
his heart and he wept and cursed.
Resistance crumbled . They took his
farmhouse and forced him and his
fantin out. There was another
powerful people who were at odds
with his supposed allies. Maybe they
would give him and his people help.
But no. they were liars like the other
ones and his farm would probably
end up belonging to them. No, he
would look somewhere else. Yet at
the moment there seemed to be
nothing else to do. He had been forc-
ed from his farm by invaders. heand
his brothers. and forced tolive in an
unproductive dustbowlwith nothing
to say about it. It wasthenhe realiz-

freedom and he and he and his
ancestor‘s abhorrence of violence
that he had been unprepared and
was in the present situation. Sudden-

other group wouldn‘t be such a bad

Aid for Handicapped
Students is Urged

The Rehabilitation Service.
located in the Student Life Office. is
currently recruiting volunteer and
salaried help for wheelchair students
as well as those with sight dis-
abilities.

There are currently about 80
physically handicapped students
attending SUNYA. Admissions pro-
jections show a marked increase in
the total number for next year. For
many of the wheelchair students. as
well as those with sight disabilities.
volunteer and salaried help from
fellow students is a basic necessity
enabling continued studies at tile
camptus. Without it. many of these
people will either not be able to con-
tinue as students here; or for new
students ad mittedl'or this sum mer or
next fall. beginning full-time atten-
dance will still not be possible.

Many wheelchair students living
on State Quad. if (in-campus
residents. dc pend on help with daily
living routines. This help may in-

clttde such necessities as dressing.
getting in and out of bed. bathing.
doing laundry. and doinglight rootn
cleaning. Generally. the needed
attendant is required to be a
suitemate of thmvheclchair student.
Presently assigned housing contract
assignments can .usually be changed
at this early date fo r a new attenda nt.
Those with sight disabilities fre-
quently need readers and notetakers.

'l‘hesejobs are frequently salaried
and can greatly aid the student who
is struggling to meet room, board
and tuition bills.

The Rehabilitation Service is try-
ing to bttild a roster of those non-
handieapped students who would be
willing to be contacted by a han-
dicapped student in need of help,
Help is very much in need for both
this summer session and next fall.
Those interested a run rged to contact
Alaync (hand of th" Rehabilitation
Service. as soon as possible. at 457-

thus feedrhis family. Maybe freedom
was not all that important. after all
his ancestors had becnwithoutit . .. .
The past school year has seen the
‘ outbreak and settlement (?)of many
areas of violence in the world. Over
thirty'years of war ended for Viet-
nam. ﬁve years of bloody civilwar in
Cambodia. and the‘winding down of
the fighting on Cyprus. Yet as these
struggles end foigt ,c time being,
others start up. H story repeats itself
time and again.\, ' 

In l57 l. 30.000'Tu‘rkish troopsun-
der Suliemnnn lV invaded the island
of Cyprus and after a brief seige,
took it over. The losses'were made
up and a permncnt garrison of30.—
000 troops. was stationed there.
FrogiﬂhcseﬁODOO and their wives
ha. prung the present Turkish pop-
ulation in Cyprus.“ '

There were several revolts oc-
cttrring afterwards; not of Turk
against Greek. bill of TURKISH
CYI’RIOT VS. 'I‘URK! It seems the
Turkish government in Turkey was
taxing ltcr own people in Cyprus as
well as t he Greek-Cypriotsintensive-
ly. The first revolt in Int“) under
Mck met Ogolou and the second un-
der the commandant of Kyrenia
Castle were both suppressed with

Ilood. After Ogolou‘s unsuccessful

ttentpt. Cyprus became the per-
onal property of the (i rand Vizier
and shortly after became a province
of the Turkish Empire.

In [878 began a new era in the
history of Cyprus. In the Treaty of
Berlin ofthat same year. Cyprus was
sold to the British for the sum of90.-
()00 pounds per annurn (roughly
3250.000 uninﬂated dollars). This
90.000 pounds (payment ended in
I9 [4) was actually paid by theSultan
back to the English and the French
as payments for a loan during the
Crimean War of l855-56.

ln l9l4. before the start of the
war. cyprth was anncXcd by Great
Britain and the Turkish Cypriots
were offered positions on the
Turkish mainland. they refused.

In I950 the guerilla warfare began
against the English which finally
culminated in the declaration of the
independence of Cyprus in I960.

August I974; Cyprus is again in-
vaded by forces of Turkey. These
40,000 troops were part ofa NATO
contingency force entirely tinned by
families for a more permanent
“visit.” The reason for the takeover is

 

 

 

given as being to protect theTurkish
minority on Cyprus. History calls
them liars.

What was the reason for the
Turkish conquest of the Byzantine
Empire in I453. onyprus in l57l.
and Rhodes in I578? Wasthe reason
that one and one-half million

Armenians were killed or massacred”?

in l9l5 and one million Greeks in
I922 becausethe Turks hate boththe
Armenians and the Greeks? No. of
course not. Their real reason is the
attempt to do what eve ry othercoun-

try of the world tries or has tried to
do in one form or another. That is
the consolidation and expansion of
power. Unfortunately they are using
the same methods used by the Euro-
pean co untriesduring the Reforma-
tion and the Renaissance.

Today Turkey. which has had a
military government since just
before the world war, now occupies
40%of Cyprus and is thrcateningthe
Greek islands of the dodocancsc su p-
poscdly for the oil content. So you
see nothing has really changed for
over five hundred years and over
four hundred for Cyprus.

The one country that can change
this situation is the U.S. Recently I
read something however. which put
a scare into me. On the way to
Taiwan for Chiang-kai-Shek‘s
funeral last month. the Vice-
l’resident (Rockefeller) was asked
about the cutoff of military aid to
Turkey. Rockefeller. as is President
Ford. is in favor of resuming aid to

you think about little green men or
green cheese for that matter. but as
Vice-President of the United States
I‘m very interested. I can assure you
that Greeks don't feel happy about
the killing or maiming of their
cousins. and although hated at the
end. the junta did an awful lot of
good for Greece as Greeks now are
beginning to realize.

Today in the world there are
countless cycles occurring like the
one in Cyprus. I think the U.S. has
the potter to end these bloody cycles
and I think many of the students at
the University will have a hand in
this. One thing is for sure. however.
the Turks have no right to he in
Cyprus and they never had. but peo-
ple are going to remain homeless or
ill a ruined state as long as the
Turkish soldiers are there or until
they are integrated into the society as
were the treeps of IhelSultan to begin
another cycle of bloodshed. and
another. and another.. . ..
