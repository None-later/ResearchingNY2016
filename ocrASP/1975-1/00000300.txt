they are more priviledged than any other. To the extent that the sit-in isp rotesting the

. . . A Cause for Rebellion

There is one solution to Student Association‘s ﬁnancial crunch that has been quietly
discussed in recent weeks. The AAB (Athletic Advisory Board) gets a quarter of the
available SA funds for use in intercollegiate athletics. and ifanothersource offunding
could be found for sports. or if cuts were made in those budgets, CentraICou ncil would
have far more money to work with.

The SUNY system is unique in that the state legislature refuses to pay for
intercollegiate sports. and there is a growing feeling among all students. athletes and
spectators alike, that it is unfair to make students pay for it.

Some people inSASU (Student Association ofthe State University)have suggested
that if every SUNY student government withdrew intercollegiate sports funding
enough pressure would be brought against the legislature by students. parents,
administrators,alumni.and people living near the schools that the legislature would
have no choice but to allocate funds for sports. The idea behind this is sound; no one
thinks students should pay for it at the expense ofso many other groups. The amount
needed. not more than a few million. is not Iargeina budgetthe size of New York’s.

It has been pointed out that the NCAA could conceivably never let at SUNY school
brick in after they all withdrew. That would be. for some. a disaster. The beneﬁts of
intercollegiate sports, especially the very popular ones. are well known. But. in spite of
those benefits. we no longer continue tospend twenty-ﬁve percentofourtax money on
sports because they simply do not provide anywhere near twenty-five percent ofthe
returns students get on their tax money. -

Maybe Student Association was once able to afford it. but with the pressure ofthe
economy and the needs of hundreds of SA groups. another source offundingmust be
found. Every effort must be made by SA. the administration. SASU.and the state to
take this burden offthe backs of student taxpayers. We can no longer bear it.

When the student unrest of the 1960's went
into its eclipse. mostpeoplcbclicvcd that there
would he no more of it for quite a while. So
far. that prediction has rtrn true to fortit. But
there have been some rumblings Iater which
perhaps indicate tltat a change is occurring.
There is no war to protest. the Kent State
killings have at the least. dimmed iit our
memories. artd there are no fallen leaders to
mourn. The CIA question docs not yet trigger
the sharp emotional uprisings needed to

So what problem would be large enougltto

problem that is at the base of so many
problem: money. In case you have not
noticed, we are still in the midst of a deep
recession

When this country falls into areccssion.two
things occur rather quickly: cuts in budgets
and decreases in financial aid. The aid
problem would appear to be more pressing.
For aid helps the poor and the middle class.
and they are hurt the most in a recession. The
combination of less aid and increased
irnemptoyment is frightening; it means that
many students will not be able to continue
their higher education. Students faced with
this disaster might become very angry and
vent their frustration by demonstrating.
