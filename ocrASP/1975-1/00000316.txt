 mintstrations' of the two higher

educational institutions. both
schools want to continue the experi-
ment. ,

Eleven students of the Moscow In-
stitute and their teacher. Igor
Poluyan recently _retumed to the
Soviet Union after four months in
the United States.

“Our chief aim was to getsome
practice in speaking and understan-
ding ‘Iiving‘ English.“ said Poluyan.
“It is a difﬁcult predicament for a
foreign student to ﬁnd himself in a
world where he has to speak English.
Our students did their best to adjust
their accents. which was not so easy.
because at our institute we teach
them Oxford English. In Albany.
various dialectsare used by students
and teachers. and in tltis sense our

students beneﬁted from their studies

of dialects."

“Before lutving for the United
States. I wondered whether I could
ever work as a translator." said
Yevgeny Kramarcnko. a student in
his fourthyearattheinstitute."lwas
not sure of myself. But after getting
some practice. I realized that I need
not have had so many doubts.“

“We lived in a dormitory among
American students. and our conver-
sations with them often lasted past
midnight." said Andrei Cherednik.
“This was no lessimportant than our
uthcmic studies. I am glad to have
had this opportunity to leam English
and student slang firsthand. Whenl
work as a translator. l willhave to be
able to understand every kind of
English. and not only the Oxford
kind."

“I wanted to know." said Alex-
ander Gordiyevsky. “what my
cohorts in the USA thought about.
and what thcystrove for. l was pleas-
ed to answer all their questions
about the Soviet Union. I have to say
that the students here know very lit-

realtzed that they got
most of th dens about its from the
Russian classicsLAxnton Chekhov,
Fyodor Dostoycvsky and Leo
Tolstoy. They hardly know any of
the presentday Soviet write...
Before our departure. one of the
teachers showed me a composition
by an American student who had
been studying with us. He wrote that
personal contact with Russian

. students had helped him to change

his stereotyped idea about the
USSR.“

“We constantly associated with
the Americans." said Sergei
Kamensky. “Since we Were the first
Soviet students in Albany. everyone
was pretty interested in us. We es-
tablished excellent relations with the
students of Albany. The Americans
were very friendly and sociable. We
weren‘t limited to meeting only
students and teachers. For instance.
my friend Andrei Cherednik and I
were introduced to a family who in-
vited us to their home on Long
Island for Thanksgiving Day. We
had a good time. wandered around
the deserted batches. admired the
scenery. and had a relaxing break
from our studies."

“We are indebted to Dr. Charles
Colman. Director of the Inter-
natiottal Students Program. who
spared no efforts to make ottr prac-
tical training a succesth spokesman
for the group said. “He drew up a
highly interesting cultural program
for us."

The Soviet students toured
Washington. DC. Buffalo. and
New York. They also took part in
conferences and delivered lectures
on the USSR at schools.

Students to Get New Viewpoint

by Patrick McGIynn

The ﬁrst copies of Vicnyminl 75-
76. the SUNYA student handbook
published annually by the Student
Association and distributed free to
the freshmen and incoming transfer
students. will be ready forthe third
Freshman Summer Planning Con-
ference Monday. July 7. The latest
edition of l’iwt'pninl is larger in page
size and. according to Editor-in-
Chief Bob Wong. is more effectively
organized and contains more infor-
mation than previous editions.

The handbook was not available
for the first two freshmen orienta-
tion meetings beta use ofunexpccted
difficulties that delayed printing and
binding. Freshmen who attcttded
conferences which ended before the
book was ready will receiVe their
copies in the mail before the Fall
semester begins.

l’it’tv/lullll75-7b measures eight
and one-half inches. or roughly the
size of such magazines as Naliunal
Lampoon and Modern
I’Itulugraphy. as opposed to the size
of past Viewpoints which had
dimensions ofsix by nine inches. the
size of the university‘s Un-

dergraduate Bulletins. The larger-
size format was adopted this year
because. according to Wong. the
larger page holds proportionately
more material than the smaller. and
the larger size is more suited to the
purpose ofa student handbook. “It‘s
easier to read. it‘s easier to hold
open. and the pages a re nicer to look
at." said Wong.

The larger book also allowed to
inclusion of a new feature ~a pull-
out-two-page spread of emergency
and service telephone numbers.
emergency procedures. and dialing
instntctions. The piece isdcsigncd to
be tacked or taped tothe wall next to
a suite‘s or room's telephone. for
both convicncc (in trying to lind a
commonly-called number) and
assistance in an emergency.

The new Virlt‘puiltl incorporates a
number of other original design
elements. originated by Wong and
Design Editor Donna Harris. The
book is clutrly divided into separate
sections. each containing material
on various aspects of living in and
around and going to school at
SUNYA. The telephone pullout is
contained in the “Help!” section.

A new TWIST

It was just a question of time: the
Mattel Toy Company is out with a
new female doll whose breasts grow
before your very eyes.

The new doll‘ called “Growing up
Skipper”. is equipped with a special
arm. All you have to do is give the
arm a twist and—presto—two
bumps appear in just the right
places.

Mattel says that "Growing up
Skipper“ helps teach children about
puberty. Next. perhaps. f‘Growing
up George“?

LESS WASTE

Rodale l’ress says that U.S. toilet
paper manufacturers could save at
least 300 million pounds of paper -
or 2.5 million trees—annually by
trimming toilet rolls one-half inch.

The conservations group reports
conductittg an experiment for one
tnortth with its own employees. trim-
ming one half-inch frotn the sides of
toilet rolls used by its workers.

Rodalc's says that unwitting
employees went through the satne
number of toilet rolls as before.
thereby using ll percent less paper.

The 2.5 tnillion trees saved,
Rodalc‘s says. would cover an area
four times the size of Washington.

LOCI-I NESS

A group of British firemen have
created a unique device in an effort
to lure the fabled Loch Ness monster
into public view.

.Firemcn from chfordshire have
constructed an artificial female
monster. 40 feet long—complete
with a mating callmto coax the real
monster from the deep.

The artificial monster‘s “very
soulfull mating wll" has been
provided by th liritish Broadcasting
Company‘s archives.

The phony monster will be
propelled through the Loch Ness
waters by a silent motor. piloted by
one of the firemen inside.

The group of firemen. when ask-
ed. admitted they have no solid
reason at all to believe the illusive
monster is. in fact. a male.

THE BETTER
'VIAY _

High Timesmagazineis out with a
report. recommending that pot
smokers store their stash inside at
least two buggies.

The magazine warns that light.
heat and oxygen will all take their
toll on the weed—slowly transfor-
ming potent marijuana into weaker
staff.

To preserve the potency of dope.
the magazine says. users should
wrap it tightly in a plastic bag. and
adds that inside two bags is even
more beneficial. High 7'iIm‘.\'s“tates
that the best way ofall to preserve
marijuana is to map it tightly inside
two baggies and then place it itt the
freezing compartment of the
refrigerator.

DOGS DO IT

The Upjohn Company claims to
have developed a pet food that
works as a birth control agent on
dogs.

The company says that two years
of tests on 200 beagles were 100 per-
cent effective. and that it will now
apply to the FDA. for approval to
market the food.

Oncdrawbacktothc new product.
l“.l).A. officials warn, is its potential
effectonltuma ns. Stud ics have found
that. because of high meat prices.
hundreds of thousands of pounds of
dog food are consumed by
Americans each year.

EAT A BUG

A University of Wisconsin en-
tomologist says his stidies indicate
that insects are the answer to the
world‘s food crisis.

Professor (icnc Del‘oliart reports
he hasfound that many insects ttrc
higher itt protein than are meats and
soy beans.

DeFoliart says. as an example.
that termites ltavc a higher protein
content than beef and that housef-
ly pupae are of higher nutritional

value than soybean oil meal.

The professor says that in one
sueessful experiment he fed manure
to housefly larvae. and then fed the
maggots to chickens. He stated that
the birds prospered and laid healthy.
high—quality eggs.

DeFoliart admits that the one
problem to using his solution for
food shortages is that most people
would lose theirappetites if served a
plate. say. of sauteed spiders. He
says he once tasted a bug ten years
ago~~a silkworm pupae—and that
the taste “wasn't very good".

' RATED X

A Washington. 'l).C. psychiatrist
has told the American Psychiatric
Association that tnuch oflhe appeal
of Walt Disney‘s characters comes
frotn underlying sexual imagery.

Doctor Michael lirody told the
A.l’.A. convention in Anaheim thttt
Walt Disney‘s comic pagesare filled
with subtle allusions to analand oral
sex. urges.

the doctor cited as one example
the character l’innochio. Doctor
lirody said that l’innochio‘s nose
getting longer was an obvious
parallel to a male erection: he added
that l’innochio was only able to
become a “real boy“ when he saved
himself and his step-father from
what the doctor culls "oral incor-
poration" by a whole.

The doctor sit id that examples of
Disney's "anal hang-ups" included
the “often kicked iii the butt .litniny
Cricket“ and the “exaggeratedly but-
tockcd Tinkerbell“. Doctor Iit'ody
announced his findings in Anaheim.
just a few blocks away from Dis-
neyland.

I out with new reports

women who are alcoho

children.

In one Boston University study of

82 births. nine oltheinfahtsbom had
mothers who were alcoholics. The
Boston research team found that

only one of the nine infants was con- .

sidered mentally normal.

Another study. this one by the Un-
iversity of Washington. concluded
that one third of’the babies born to
women with
problemsare bornwith high levels of
alcohol in their bloodstreams.Ac-
cording to Doctor Ann Streissguth.
of the University_of Washington‘s
Psychiatry Department. children
born with alcohol in their systems
are far more likeky to be retarded
than infants who are born sober.

And if this were not enough of a
problem. a Johns Hopkins Universi-
ty study Itas found that most preg-
nant women are also reluctant to tell
doctors about their drinking habits.

COFFEE

If you‘re a coffee addict. here's
sortie bad news for you. ~

Nu/urc magazine is out with a

report that coffee. il'taken with such ‘

foods as bacott and cheese. is likely
to cause cancer.

'l'wo scientists. Doctors lirian
Challis and Chris lktrlett. say that
coffee mixes in the stomach with
preservatives found in such foods as
cheese and pork products. The com-
binittiott of all of this. the two doc-
tors say. causes the formation of
cancer-causing agents known as
nitrosamines.

The doctors say that nitt'osamines
often form in the stomach. but that
they are passed out of the body
before they become harmful.
However. the doctors warn. when
coffee is taken with certain preserved
loods. the nitt'osamincs form so
rapidly that they can‘t be ejected
from the body quickly enough.
