Statistic

by Roxanne Reisch

A funny thing happens to your sanity when
you're looking for a job. You lose it. As
fortune would have it. I was suffering from
acute depression after four unsuccessful
interviews for employment as a newspaper
reporter. My ﬁngers had walked through the
name of almost every newspaper. magazine
and publishing company in the Manhattan
yellow pages and dialed countless. futile
phone calls.

I was lying in bed at the end of March
watching three sticks of Wrigley‘s Spearmint
gum dance across the TV screen when l
remembered the resume I had sent two weeks
ago. to Newrdqv. the Long Island newspaper.
I searched my pocketbook for the name of
Newsday'r managing editor—written on the
inside of a Juicy Fruit gum wrapper.

“David Hamilton. 516-294-3527," l said
aloud running into the kitchen towards the
telephone.

“What did you say Roxy." my mother asked
as she place halfa hagel into the toaster.

“Nothing Mom. I just have another
newspaper to call.“ She had seen my pre-
telephonc psych-up routine before. After
pacing the kitchen in my blue nightshirt. |
recited variations of my opening monologue.
“Hello.my nameis Roxanne Reisch. . ."“Hi
there Mr. Hamilton. I‘m a student at the State
University of New . . . “ “Sir. maybe you‘ve
received my resume. maybe you haven‘t.

it

maybe you hire college . . . v

"Idiale‘d'tlte' nuniber quickly. "Nersday, can
I help you?” 7 _ V '

"-Yes. my name is Roxanne Reisch and um,
um." I glanced at my mother shaking her head.
“I‘d like to speak to Mr. Hamilton about
possible. . ." 311.821. _ ,

“Mr. Hamilton's ofﬁce." an elderly
woman‘s voice answered.

“Yes, my name is Roxanne Reisch and I
sent a resume to your office two weeks ago."
My voice had dropped back dowu. to its
normal pitch. “I wonder if I can haVe an
interview with Mr. Hamilton.“ I heard the
sound of rustling papers for several minutes.

“Yes. Miss Reisch I found your resume. It
was on the bottom of the pile. How'about
tomorrow at eleven."

“That will be ﬁne.“ I said in my most
business-like voice.

“You know there are no jobs,“ the voice
said.

“That‘s fine.“ I said enthusiatically. “See
you tomorrow."

“How do you like that Mom. An interview
and I only said ‘um‘ twice."

“Lovely. where‘s Newsrlqv?"

I threw my arms back hitting the counter
and knocking over my glass oforangejuice. “I
forgot to ask.“

A t |0258 the following day. I sat. dressed in '

my Sunday best. in Mr. Hamilton‘s tiny.
cluttered office. Mr. Hamilton looked a
youthful thirty. with straight. long black hair
and a full beard. What I found interesting
about his appearance was the badly cracked
left lens of his glasses.

“Nice to meet you Miss Reisch,“ he said as I
tried to see past the cracked lens into both his
eyes. “I must admit I don‘t know where your
resume is. My secretaiy is out today.“

"'l'hat‘s OK.“ I answered. “I just happen to
have and extra one with me." I opened '
manila envelope and removed one of the IS
resumes I carried with me. After all. what can
you do with 'ltllt resumes?" For the same price.
Al"l‘ Publications offered me the choice of 20

or [00 resumes. After careful considérition, I

decided to take the Ill). I could always use
scrap paper. g » o k " _ ,

‘_‘Let me befrank with you Miss Reisch. We‘
consider ourselves to be a big'newspape’r, a
fine writer‘s paper. We don't hire college
graduates. We're looking‘for people with daily
newspaper experience. Why, we get close to 70
lettersa week from college students so you can
see your chances are very poor. And, like I
said. we don‘t bite college graduates."

Myrmind was racing ahead to a momentous
conclusion.

“Then why was I granted an interview."

“Well we do make exceptions."

"Good. maybe I‘m the exception.“ I said
leaning back in my chair and crossing my legs.

“A sense of humor. I like that." Mr.
Hamilton said. "Tell me. how have yourother
interviews gone?"

“Let me be frank (I was mocking him I

 . .you can’tget the opportunity for
experience because you don't have the
experience. "

 

warned myself). It‘s like Catch-22. You can‘t
get a reporting job unless you‘ve worked on a
daily basis for a newspaper and you can't get
the opportunity for experience because you
don‘t have the experience."

“ch. it is an interesting dilemna.“ Mr.
Hamilton said, smiling. "Well, Miss Reisch. I
like what I see. Hmm. Ofcourse. wcdon't hire
students straight out of college but I‘m going
to let you take this test and fill out an
application. Ofcourse. you don't have to take
the test if. . ."

“No. I‘ll take the test." I said eagerly. It‘s an
area in which I have lots of experience.“

“You'll have to write two news stories and
one feature article." Mr. Hamilton continued.
“Don‘t rush. You‘re not being timed.
However. if you're still here tomorrow
morning 1'“ know you‘re not cut out to he a
reporter.“

I unslrapped my watch and placed it on the
desk before me which immediately evoked a

calmed down and eyed the exit. The test read.
“#3. feature story. You invent the facts.” In
less than ﬁfteen minutes I had weaved the tale
of Mr. Mainstream. a prominent
brainsurgeon. who traded in his scapel for a

pair of cars as he embarked in a rowboat on a

never-to-retum trip to a deserted island. He
was traveling with his long time companion.

“Not bad. An hour and seven minutes.“
(Who‘s being timed I said to myself.)

“Let mebe f rank again Miss Reisch. Let's say

excellent. and we decide we might take a

your trial period couldn‘t possibly come up for
at least a year.“

I was contemplatinga quick dash to theexit
but Mr. Hamilton continued.

“I think I‘m going to do you a favor Miss
Reisch. I‘m not going to call you in for your
trial period until a position is available for
you. considering of course. that you did well
on this test."

“That‘s very kind of you. Well. thank you

“Well, Mr.

“Oh. Miss Reisch. keep that sense ofhumor.

“I think so too." I said assertively. Maybe
