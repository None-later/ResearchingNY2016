(CPS) A graduate student at
Syracuse University (NY). involved
in a morassof lawsuits. has en-
couraged students nationwide to
consider suing their universities if
school courses don't match up to the
catalog description.

Thomas White. graduate student
in philosophy, is suing Syracuse for
“breach of contract". claiming that
the philosophy department has (I)
ignored traditional philosophical
research in favor of "linguistic"
philosophy; (2) admitted students

‘ “Savs'Sue’Schwv'

without philosophy background
into the Ph.D program and (3)
duplicated courses taught in other
departments. White has asked for
damages of $3989—the cost of his
education.

For its part Syracuse has filed a
countersuit against White for SI 1.-
llo for defense costs. lost time of its
employees and punitive damages.

White has claimed that linguistic
(or “analytic“) philosophy demeans
traditional philosophical methods
by replacing fundamental

Bargaining Role
For Students

by Neil Klotz

Bruce Hanson was worried. The
Montana student lobbyist had just
spearheaded a successful legislative
drive to guarrantcc students in his
state a voice in faculty collective
bargaining. It was the first time
students had won that right.

Previously the consumers of
education had been left peeking
through cracks in the negotiation
room door as ltrbor (the faculty)and
management (the administration)
decided issues that would directly
affect tuition. class size and student
services. Students watched their role
in campus decision—making. hard-
won during the late 60's slowly
backed away. litnb by limb. on the
l’rocrustiair bargaining table.

The recent union contract
agreements effect on SUNYA‘s Un-
ivcrsily Senate is an example of un-
ion power.

The Monturit student bill had
started in reverse all that by
guaranteeing students not only
observer status. but the right to par-
ticipate in caucuses before. during
and after negotiations. So why
worry'.’

l-lnnson wasdistraughthecause he
had just found out thata bill likely to
pass Congress this year Would
overrule his legislation and put
faculty collective bargaining at
public universities under the control
of the National labor Relations
Board (NLRB).

Who‘s afraid of the NLRB? Just
about every student active in
bargaining. The NLRB has con-
sistently ruled that students even
laborers like graduate teaching
assistants and cafeteria workers
have no place at the table. They
should read their book sand shut up.
the Board has said in effect on
several occasions. "The NLRB will
not always side with students in any
way possible." Alan Shark. director
ol the Research l’rojecton Students
and Collective llargainirig told me.
"It‘s very conservative and very in-
d ustrially oriented."

And. quoth the NLRB. in the in-
dustrial university students are little
more than the rivets spat out to hold
together a faltering economy.

In all fairness. the Congressional
bill introduced by Rep. Frank
Thompson (D-NJ) wasn't meant to
screw students. It intends to grant
the l4 million local. stateand federal
employees in the US the same right
to organize and bargain that workers

Thompson has said he would like
HR77 to "jog" them into action.

Thompson‘s bill would supercede
all weaker state laws. Probably
about 40 of 50 states would go under
the NLRB. and studentsatpublic in-
stitutions in those states would lose
any chance for guaranteed input
bargaining. '

According to most observers.
chances for the bill's passage in this
session are excellent. Both the
American Federation of Teachers
and its powerful parent. the AFL-
CIO. have thrown their lobbying
clout behind it. And. mindful of the
millions of dollars from public
employee unions that helped elect
him. how can your average liberal
94th Congressman say no?

Fortunately. there‘s still at least ii
chance for students to turn things
around, When hearings on the bill
begin later this summer. special in—
trests will unroll a laundry list of
items they want exempted from the
federal bill. like state tenure laws.
retirement systems and so on. liut
despite political comment on the bill
from left and right. no one has men-
tioned its effects on students.
probably because their lobbying
muscle is rated at something below
non-existent. When laundry list time
comes. students are typically the
first to go dirty.

In Washington. the National Stri-
dent Lobby nnd National Student
Association. neither of which have
been particularly on top of the
bargaining scene. have remained
mum on the ’lltompson bill. llotli
groups are reportedly bogged down
with internal linancing problems.
but hopefully one of them will sur-
face in time for the hearings on the
bargaining hill. Considering that
H R77 could conceivably cut
students out of bargaining in all
public institutions. some sort of
protest letter. or even a note. would
be appropriate.

llruce lliinson. in the meantime.
has found out tliirt the federal bill
would probably override the Mori-
triira lriw wand with ittliegurirantced
student input he worked to get. "Ite-
iﬂg involved in the first bill. I don't
want to lose it." he told us. If
necessary. he said Ire would go to
Washington himself to plead the stu~
dent case.

If not lltinson. someone should
go. It would be ironic if students
were shut out just as they began to
realise what they‘re missing when
faculty and administration huddle

philosophical thought with
philologieal. analysis and threatens,
the survival ‘of philosophy as an
academic subject. Aside from
Syracuse. linguistic philosophy also
dominates philosophy departments
at Harvard'MlT. Tutti. and Boston
University. according to some
observers. .

White said he has been harassed
by the philosophydepartmentfor his
outspoken criticism and that he has
been subject to “vicious and brutal
verbal assults." manipulation of test
grades. cancellation of f‘uuincial aid
and denial of due process appeal

“You presentius with a difﬁcult

teach you anything. we must first
dispel your delusions of
philosophical grandeur. But you are
so arrogant in your ignorance that I
doubt whether this is possible."
White said that the letter could
constitute libel because it was

“published” on department
stationary and was hence not a per-
sonal letter.

White would also like to trees “bill

inform them of rights. obligations
and duties. In addition. White seeks
a “depoliticizing” of comprehensive
exams, possibly through the use of
outside evaluators. which could

SUMMER, 1975

A sea of purple jerseys surged off
the ﬁeld as the ﬁnal whistle blew.
The players rampaged through the
lockeroom to celebrate their un-
beaten season.

ﬂie l974 season for Albany State
marked the first perfect record by a
Capital District college in sixty
years.

The past campaign was only the
second year of varsity competition
for Albany. The football program
was constructed in I970. The growth
of Great Dane football is a
rcmarka ble story.

Football was started to answer a
student desire for gridiron competi-
tion. The Albany Athletic Advisory
Board set aside money for ten years
to properly fund a football program.

was hired as head footballcoach. His
job began without equipment.

Football History: Albany 

They had outside responsibilities
that hampered their field instruc-
tion. The assistants had masters
degrees to complete on top of re-
quired scouting and recruiting.
Coach Ford relied heavily on
volunteer help to fill the spaces left
by his skeleton stall.

In I970 Albany compiled a 24
record as a club team. That season
was curtailed by scheduling dif-
ficttlties'. Albany was unable to find
many teams to play on its level.

C oach Ford \ 'us pleased with this
first season. His desire was to
employ heavy recruiting over the
winter to accelerate the program. As
the scouts visited high schools that
winter they faced a dilemma: few
schools were aware that football ex-
isted at Albany State. The schools
were pessimistic about the stability
of the program. and consequently
the recruiting plan was set back.

In the second season the Danes
finished 4-4. They played teams with

The I972 season was an experi-
ment for Coach Ford. He stressed
the freshmen and sophomoreson the
field. He brought the wishbone
offense to his youngsters to find they
could handle the system. The result
was a 6-H record.

The next season was the first for
the Danes as a recognized NCAA
varsity team. The schedule ltitd
better competition than previous
years. The contests included Nichols
College. Curry College. and
