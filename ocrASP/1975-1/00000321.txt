Ap is part of the newly offered
Summer Theatre Production and
Management Course (Thr. 4l5 for
undergraduates of TM. 515.
graduate). a six credit, innovation
which Department Chairman and
company originator James symons
mysf'should offer the student a

  

 

‘ different kind of theatre experience“.

The group will consist of three
faculty directors. Dr. Symons. Dr.
Edward Golden and Mr. Eric Pop-
pick; four designers and technical
assistants, Robert .I. Donnelly.
Harry Feiner. Thorn Prager and
Michail Smith; and twenty-three
students who were chosen from a list
of over a hundred applicants. ‘

Unlike the group format of
previous years. which played by ear
for the most part. with a large com-
munity effort, this‘years crucmh/eis
the first to begin the summer season
with an established “company”. A
radical departure from the normal
school curriculutn. the compatty will
be a fulltimccndeavor. requiringthe
utmost work and creativity from
those involved. All acting and
technical work will be done by corn-
pany members (though occasionl
guest performers from the communi-
ty may appear) in an atmosphere as
close to a professional situation as
possible.

The new emphasis. however, is not
meant to be instituted to the detrc-
ment of the more educational goals

Says Dr. “Symons, "Since the credit
for this course will be based on ac-‘
tivity' and not on papers. classes. ex-
ams or text books— based on the
purely functional. practical
applications— it's necessary for us to
be sure that everyone in the course
really has significant work to do."

Erie Clapton—Sontag:

It was billed as “Eric Clapton-
Reggae Rock. with Carlos Sttnllnl".
on June 26 at Saratoga Performing
Arts Center. The music was anything
but reggae rock. The concertopened
with Carlos Santana’s set mixed with
old songs such as “Black Magic
Woman" and “Oye Como Va” in ad-
dition to newer songs such as “Time
Waits for No One“. Playing to an
enthusiastic crowd, Santana cap-
tivated the attention of the audience
something rarely accomplished by
back-up bands today. After com-
pleting his set of energized latin-rock
(spiced with a good amount of jazz)
the audience refused to allow San-
tana to go without doing an encore,

It's been nearly a year now since
Eric Clapton resumed touring.
Before then. Clapton had spent
several years screwing around and
procrastinating after the break-up of
Derek and the Dominoes in I97].
When 1th Eric Clapton Band did
begin t5 tour in Imid-l974. Clapton
was very unsure of himself. Many
times he would shy away from play-

with several of them havinga reggae
best (which has its roots in the music
of Jamaica). '

Performing to a capacity crowd at
SPAC. the group opened the so-
called reggae concert with a rocking
version of “Layla”. setting the
audience into a near manic state of
hysteria. The roar of the crowd was
deafening. to the extent tha'tClaptoit
himself was trying to quiet them
down. “...I can‘t even hear meself
think!“ In a vain effort to try and
pacify the audience.Yvonne Elliman
played a very mellow version of the
Blind Faith song “Can‘t Find My
Way Home".

The nearly two hour long set con-
sisted mainly of songs from the
Layla album such as “Tell the
Truth“. “Bell Bottom Blues,and the

tunes as “Let It Rain" and “Blues

“K'rioeki'rt‘ on Heav‘ n's Door”. M '
of the song were dominated by Clap-
ton on lead vo'esls and some of the
wallingest guitar leads since his days
with Cream and Derek and the
Dominoes. Employing speed. taste
and raw guts in his phying, Clapton
magniﬁcently displayed the qualities

 

that earned him the reference of

"Clapton is God".

For the last two songs of the even-
ing. Clapton was joined on stage by
Carlos Santana. To the delight of the
audience. they performed “Eyesight
to the Blind" (as it was done in the
movie Tommy) and closed with a
rocking version of "Why Does Love
Have To Be So‘ Sad". For twenty
minutes. Clapton and Santana
jammed. developing and trading off
leads among themselves. These
musicians showed a great amount of
maturity. style and talent. Instead of
trying to outdo the other with ﬂash
and gimmicks. they aimed at
providing the listener with quality.
literally playing their asses off. After
reaching such a frenzy. the audience
was left screaming for an encore and
that's how it ended. the empty stage
and the relentless cries for more. But
what else could be done? In short—
ol‘ slowhand is back and kicking.

The load that the new Repertory
Company is taking on may becxtcn-
sive for so short a period. but
hopefully it‘ will provide valuable
training to potential thespians and
"techies". “We did need to do more
ﬁrearm". said Dr. Symons. “Wcjust
weren‘t doing that many shows con-
sidering the facilities we haveand the
size of the department." Also. with
luck and hard work and talent. the
season will provide an entertaining
experience for community members.

“This should further boost the im-
age ofSUNYAasa University where
alot of theatre is done." explained
Dr. Symons in reference to thc ul-
timate goals of the new program.
“Most of the major theater schools
in the country have active summer
theatre programs. This is an impor-
tant consideration for those students
who are looking for schools to
attend...l feel that the facilitiesare so
excellent here that it‘s ourobligation
to utilize them as much as possible
and for them to sit quictallsummer
seems a shame...The idea of having
four theatres at our disposal. with
shops, air-conditioning and all the
rest is an incredible invitation to don
very active summer program."

University
