System Revamped For Handling Group Fun

by Patrick McGlynn

A new system of controls over the
handling of funds belonging to some
SUNYA student groups will go into
effect this fall. The new plan.
originally proposed by Student
Association (SA) Controller Sttt
Klein. will "lighten up the present
system of agency accounts.“ as
requested by Faculty-Student
Association (l‘SA) General
Manager Norbert Zalun.

Under the old system. certain
officers of groups with FSA-
administercd ttgcncy accounts could
withdraw funds from the accounts
with nonc of the cotnmon business
procedural checks required in most
SA financial operations. For
instance. neither second and third
signatures nor documentation ofthe
need of funds were necessary under
the old system. According to
mcmorundn from Klein to groups
with agency accounts. “unless sortie
tiglttcr controls were put on agency
accounts. [FSA] would refuse to
handle them after September I.
1975."

An agency account holds funds
derived frotn sources other than
mandatory student tax. as in the case
of class councils whosc funding
comes from class dues. Other groups
with agency accounts are Photo
Service. Viewpoint. EOPSA.
'l’clelhon. Tower East Cinema. ttnd
Quad lloards.

Class dues are collected by the
llursttr in cttclt student‘s semester
bill; funds for the other groups are
derived from various sources. The
money is deposited with FSA who.
in accordance with the SUNY Iioard
of 'l‘rustccs‘ guidelines. banks and

AUGUST 26. I975

holds the funds for use by the
groups.

A series of meetings early in the
summer between Klein. Zahm, and
Dean of Student Affairs Neil Brown
concluded that “Student
Association could provide those
controls without destroying“
financial and political independence
of the groups involved.

The new system for disbursing a
group's funds. as described by chitt.
will invoch a new voucher form to
be signed and filed by a group‘s
officer. then by an officer of SA.
According to Klein. “the [Student
Association] officer will make no
valucjudgementsonthccxpcnditurc
. . . His only concern will be to make
sure that the expenditure is made in
accordance with the group‘s
constitution. and that proper
documentation [for the expenditure]
exists.“ SA will then deliver the
signed voucher to FSA. which will
issue a check to the group.

According to Brown. the new
system provides "procedural
safeguards.“ Brown noted some past
instances of checks being issued “to
individuals—which is not good
business practice.“

In his memo to Brown. Klein
noted that the majority of agency
accounts belong to SA-recognized
groups. and SA “feels that . . . it is
our responsibility to insure that
these groups are 'L'
disbursing .of their funds." The
controls to be held by SA over the
agency accounts are in keeping with
the lioard's guidelines which.
according to Brown. say that
“students handle student money."

in the -

Brown noted that. in the case of
the classes who have graduated.
some "overdue housekeeping" ol'
accounts has been made. The fundl
of some classes have not been spent
and have remained in the class
account for several years after
graduation. Under Klein‘s proposal
a class‘ agency account will now
become "inactive" six months after
the class graduates. Money in
inactive accounts will be turned over
to citltcr the Alumni Association.
which will use the funds at the
discretion of the Alumni for
reunions. etc.; or to the university's
Short Term Emergency Loan Fund.
which provides interest-free loans to
students for any expense not
provided for in the normal college
budget.

The decision of where the class‘
inactive funds will go is to be made
by the Class Counselor. an elected
ofﬁcial. Some old class accounts.
which date back to the Class of I966.
have as little as one dollar. but some
contain large sums. as much as
Sl.600 (Class of I97I). So far.
according to Klein. most inactive
class agency accounts have gone to
the Alumni Association. A total of
eight dollars from two accounts has
govc to the loan fund.

Unlike'the “top 20". SUNYA has
no clear institutional identity. says
'Ficlds. Attributing this to its rapid
growth. Fields went on to say that
this could be remedied in part by
looking to local resources. such as
industry and private fundch as a
means of gradually building up

-strcngth. He also mentioned the

desirability of developing more of a
give-and-ta‘kc relationship with the
State: “If they dcpcnd on usfor the
research they need. tltcn a kind of
warmth is there.“

In spite of his enthusiasm for
making SUNYA a better place.
Fields does not yet Itttve any speciﬁc
plans forinnovntion. He did express.
however. a desire to spaWn some
type of program to replace the spirit
and thrust of inter-disciplinary
education that will disappear when
