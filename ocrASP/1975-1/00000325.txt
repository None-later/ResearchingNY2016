It could have happened to anyone. '
' How it is ponible-to'ﬁnd yourself
in front of Judicial Board, charged
on two counts of harrassing and.
disobeying your R.A. without doing
anything wrong? Can you do no
damage. yet be billed for helping to
render a suite uninhabitable? Just
ask Gary Aderman. ~

In a series of‘articles. the ASPwill
look at some of the problems faced
by on—campus residents in dealing
with their particular landlord. the
Ofﬁce of Residences. We shall
explore some representative cases of
students who have been ensnared in
the Housing bureaucracy and see
how they have managed (or have not
managed) to light their way through
this often overwhelminginstitution.

Gary Adcrman arrived at SUNYA
last January, a transfer from
Brooklyn College. Requesting
housing on Alumni Quad. he was
placed in 3021 Eastman Tower. Gary
saw little of hos room in he became.

.  A: easygoing'fellow, 
Gary was‘mueh‘ourprired toleim. | ‘ ‘

month after, the‘ close, of last
semester. that he was'being' billed
SIS as his share of a $40 charge for
paintings total of 5 wells in his
room and suite. The possibility of
such a billing never occurred to
Gary: in his bedroom. one wall.
perhaps. was smudged; in the
suiteroom. all walls had. been
covered with posters and could not
conceivably have been marked.
Moreover. in the one semester he
had lived there. Gary simply wasn‘t
around long enough to do the
damage he was accused of. In
response to a letter from Gary asking
Housing to explain the bill. Eastman
Tower director Beth Schnitman
stated that the room was in

uextremely poor condition“ and.

further. that by signing the housing
contract Gary had agreed to pay for
the damage whether he was

students-no open and honest.“

insisted that no further elaboration
was necessary. She added that the
question of whether or nothar'y bad
actually done the damage was “not
relevant."

Gary‘s letter to Housing was the
ﬁrst step in the appeals procedure.
Ironically, the next three steps also
involved letters to Housing.
Furthermore. Gary was never
informed that it was not possible to
register an appeal after the initial
one. Even had he known of this
opportunity. however. Gary would
not have availed himself of it. The
idea of having to appeal to the very
people who had billed him in the first
place struck Gary as futile and
ludicrous. What chance is there of
keeping your money when Housing
wants it and holds the absolute

As his last not before ending his

Center and several master's and doc-
toral programs. The decisions. effec-
tive September |. 1976. are expected

in Socioloty and the Master of Arts

The state-wide ﬁnancial squeeze is
the major cause of the cutbacks,

Academic Program Priorities. The
Proirities Committee reviewed every
program in the university. ﬁnding

were recommended for suspension
or termination. six at the doctoral
level. three at the master‘s and three
at the undergraduate levc|.The com-
mittee also suggested cutbacks in six
programs. additional resources for
five. and the establishment of two
new programs.

I believe this was called blackmail.“
writes Gary. "nowadays it‘s passed
off as efﬁcient management."

Gary looked elsewhere for aid.
Student Association has established
the position of Ombudsman to help
students having difficulties with
faculty and administration. There
have already been a number of
complaints about the billing process
reports .lon Levenson. last year‘s
Ombudsman. Meanwhile. S.A. Vice
President. Rick Meckler. has been
having problems of his own with
Housing. Billed $15 for “excessive
garbage.“ Mceklcr doubts that the
charge-reﬂects the actual cost of
cleaning his room and cannot believe

propriations for more faculty or

be. as Benezet noted. “moving in in-
creasingly competitive times within
continued constraint of resources."

Allen Center students and faculty
are very enthusiastic about their
program. “To say that the Allen
Center is too expensive is facetious.“
said Dr. Seth W. Spellman. tltL‘
program's director. “Any new
program will be expensive.“
Spellman pointed out that the
Center was improving every year.

in assessing the bill.

The SA. officers were receptive to
a request for help from Gary
Aderman. They have since dealt with
(iary‘s case and others like it in talks

- with Director of Residences. John

Welly. and others. In addition. S.A.
may help Gary in bringing a lawsuit
against the University in a state
court. (In another article. we will see
what happened to one student who
was billed by the Office of
Residences and brought the State to
court.) .
Meanwhile. Gary has been forced
to pay his bill. But with the
possibility of a refund still there.
S.A. President Andy liauman is
optimistic. “He definitely has a good

with costs going down. Un-
dergraduate Admissions Director
Rodney A. Hart. however. noted in a
memo to Benczct that “I can‘t help
but feel that part of their attrition
problem is due to the fact that some
of their admits are not really in-
terested in the Center. but view it as a
means for easy admission with
lrecdom to select another program
once on campus." Admits that the
tt'l'lt.“ lacked the quality of
traditional admits in terms of the
“usual objective criteria." that is
SAT's. averages. and so on.

One student in a regular program
said that a course she took at the
Center was “easily the most
stimulating. enjoyable and produc-
live courses 1 have taken here.“ “I
don‘t know.“ said one popular Allen
Center faculty member. “in a few
years someone will be saying: ‘what
we need is some innovative program
at Albany.‘ "

llcneret said that the Allen Center
retrenchment had “nothing to do
with not enough students. It was too
much need for professors
elsewhere."

Ilene/.et said he Was proud of the
responsible way the Priorities report
was treated by respondents from the
department. Deans. and committees
of the University Senate. Beaezet
said the report was "substantiated"
by the university“in different ways.“
