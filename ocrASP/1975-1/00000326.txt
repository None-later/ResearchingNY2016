Audit Threatens Mohawk

by David Winzelberg

Some of SUNYA‘s "get-away-
from-it-all" facilities (i.e. Mohawk
Campus and the Glen House at
Dippikill) could be disposed of by
the rctreats' owners, FSA.

This possibility was brought
about by a state audit report on the
ﬁnancial and operating practices of
thc Faculty—Student Associations in
the SUNY system. The audit.
compiled by State Controller Arthur
Levitt. places a major focus on the
similar recreation areas throughout
the State University system. Some of
these were operating several
thousand dollars in the red.

The audit report recommends
closing many SUNY recreational
facilities: “The FSA‘s, in their
decisions to purchase and create
recreation facilities for which there is
little need by students. have
burdened future students with the

accomodated in' the existing
university residences. '

Nearly all of the rooms are single

running at half hour intervals
between the hotel and the uptown
campus. The bus service will be
available between 7:30 am. and
11:30 p.m. on weekdays. with hourly
service on weekends.

Details are being worked out for
food service and students will have
choices including on-campus mean
contracts or meals at the hotel.
Milton Kayc. operator of the hotel
restaurant, said he hoped to be able
to provide food service to at least
some of the students as early as the
ﬁrst registration day. last Thursday.
He is planning to offer breakfastand
dinner service in the new restaurant.

high cost of maintaining the
facilities. In our opinion the FSA‘s
should liquidate their investments in
recreational facilities with low
student use."

SA President Andy llauman feels
that Mohawk should be given a “fair
chance." and recommends waitinga
year before taking any action against
the facility. Bauman believes that if
these facilities are publicized and
"sold" to students they will be more
financially sound in the future. He
adds. “I‘d hate to get rid ofanything
good.“

recreational areas are reported to
cost around $40,000 annually

future of SUNYA's recreation areas.
the audit report was. in the words of
FSA Director E. Norbert Zahm.
"highly complimentary“ of Albany‘s
FSA bookkeeping and
management. Zahm said that the
FSA here was “in danger of
bankruptcy three or four years ago.“
and boasted that the auditors
“seemed quite impressed" with the
progress. Bauman agreed that the
recovery was impressive. adding,
“They‘ve turned it around."

The audit report also
recommended disolving the holding

recommended that FSA work
something out with the university

stranded at the water’s edge. How
would you react? Recently. such an
incident . in Florida evoked a
grotesque response. ‘
According to an “MOM-“med
Associated Press report in late June,
a sick baby whale which washed up
onto Miami Beach was stabbed to
death bya mob. The mutilation, now

. being investigated by the Florida

State Marine: Patrol, was the ﬁrst of
its kind in the Florida area. Eight
baby whales found stranded on
Florida beaches during the past two
years have been left alone by
spectators and cared for by
veternarians at Ocean World or
Miami Seaqu'arium. the [Patrol
reports. Since the majority of the
earlier stranded animals have been
pygmy sperm whales. some experts
believe that the mutilated animal
may have been a kogia, a type of
pygmy sperm whale which resembles
a shark.

The true identity of the animal will
be difﬁcult to determine. since it was
towed out to sea by the MiamiBeach
Police Department before it could be
examined by a trained biologist.
Even more difficult may be
explaining the cause of the brutal
human reaction. The fact that
JAWS. a movie about a man—eating
shark. had been playing in thearea at
the time of the incident. has led some
to speculate that the well-publicized
ﬁlm may have been a factor in the

“Sun-

stranded animal. .

Regardless of the cause of this a

incident. another factwhich should.
become equally well-publicised is

that stranded marine mammals such '

as porpoises. dblphins. seals. and

whales are protected by the Marine
Mammal :Protection Act. This
federal law prohibits the removal of
any part of the body of one of these
animals if found either dead or alive.
Sightings of stranded marine
mammals should be reported
immediately to the nearest ofﬁce of
the U.S. Commerce Department's
National Marine Fisheries Service.
the state ﬁsh and game agency. local
police, the coast guard. or marine
patrol. Also recommended for
contacting are nearby aquariums or
universities. In Washington. D.C..
Dr. James Mead of the Smithsonian
Institution‘s Marine Mammal
Division is heading a marine
mammal salvage program to help
determine why these animals die
near or on Atlantic shores.

The next time a beach walk does
lead to a strande'd animal. there are
several identifying characteristics to
look for which distinguish sharks
from marine mammals. The size and
color of these creatures will vary
greatly. but a shark always will have
two ﬁns on its back—a large.
centrally located one plus a smaller
one near its tail. Dolphins.
porpoises. and whales. on the other
hand. will have either one dorsal ﬁn
or none. While marine mammals

mysteriously soon after entering the
