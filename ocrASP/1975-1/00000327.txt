has .labeled Groucho Marx a
“National Security Risk.”

Columnist Jack Anderson told the
annual convention of the American
Bar Association that he has obtained
an F.B.l. file on the 87-year-old
comedian.

According to Anderson,
Groucho's file was opened three
years ago and he was labeled a
security risk by the bureau after he
was quoted in an underground
newspaper as saying he would
welcome Richard Nixon‘s

When asked about the file,
Groucho said:”l deny everything
because I lie about everything."He
paused, and then added: “And
everything i deny is a lie“-

years have been predicting that the
world will end in 1975, are beginning
to back down on that prophesy.
With just six months left before the
world is supposed to end, a Jehova‘s
Witness convention in Toronto was
told last week that the prediction has

The religious group had
calculated that I975 would bring an
end to the earth because they believe
that Adam was created 4026 years
before Christ. Believers stty the Bible
predicts that the world will be
destroyed exactly 6000 years after
Adam. which works (tul to he lht'
