The Old RaiIWa 

by reign Wikon '

More than anything else in our
history. the railroads opened up the
US. crisscrossing the country and
carrying a wave of frontiersmen into
the American heartland. The imlact
of the iron horse can be measured by
the stature of the characters that
folklore identiﬁes with those who
laid the rails and commanded the
engines. John Henry, a great hulk of
a man, swung his way through the
frontier laying rail one step ahead of
the trains. Casey Jones, who rode to
his death in a train crash, rides on in

add the “rails to trails” movement is
emerging on the nation's conscience.
It inevitably will grow as more lines
are abandoned while popular
interest in biking surges and auto
pollution and fuel consumption
stimulate searches for
transportation alternatives.

The Environmental Protection
Agency reported last December that
in 1972 alone, bike sales shot up 65
per cent, and during a two-year

survey indicates there an.  “ll!!- i 2

.Bccausc they already are cut
through cities and countryside. and
sloped at a grade suitable for biking
and hiking, abandoned railway
rights-of-way are natural corridors
for leading hikers and bikers into
sections of the country otherwise
inaccessible to them. This spring, the
Citizen's Advisory Committee on

bed already have been convened to
trails. The choicest rights-of-way for
conversion are the newly abando
ones, which are still, clear from
overgrowth and obstruction. unlike
others which have laid unused for

years. But the conversion process is '
not an easy one. The interstate

song as a symbol of the American
commitment to the railroads.

If the train charged forward
boldly in American life and
imagination a century ago. modern
headlines of railway closures and
companies tottering on the brink of
bankruptcy tell a different story
about the railway‘s future. At its
peak in 1916. the railroad covered
the country with more than 250,000
lines of rail bed. Today. 55.000 miles
of those lines have been abandoned
and thousands of additional ones
face a similar fate as the country
is too late.

The rail lines abandoned in the
battle among the train, car and
airplane for a chunk of American
transportation need not reccd
unused into oblivion. The rail beds
built by John Henry and his fellow
workers are good for more thanjust
trains. Citizens across the country

cent of all bicycles in the US are sold
to adults; six years ago it was only 12
per cent. With 40 per cent of all
urban work trips less than four miles
long, cities are looking to increased
biking as one means of reducing
gasoline consumption and urban air
pollution. For example, the City of
Denver. Colorado, plans to use
which it hopes will reduce auto
emissions by one percent this year.

One of the major obstacles to the
continued surge in biking, EPA
notes in its December-I974 report

“Bicycle Transportation." is the,

shortage of bikcways. “With several
exceptions." EPA says, ."the
majority of ‘bikc routes‘ in the
United States today consists of little
more than signs which guide
bicyclists along their routes and
warn motorists of their presence." A

Envirnomental Quality, which
reports to the President, issued
“From Rails to Trails." a
comprehensive report on the
recreational opportunites of
abandoned railroad routes, the steps
citizens should follow to take
advantage of those opportunites,
and the legal and ﬁnancial pitfalls
that should be avioded.

Thanks to the work of private
citizens, trails from rails have been
set up in several states. The Advisory
Committe cites the 35-mile illinois
Prairie Path, the 2 and 'A-mile
Cargill Long Park running through
Longview. Texas, the 32-mile Eiroy
Sparta State Trail in Wisconsin, and
Washington's lI-mile Burke-
Gilman Park as prime examples.
Most recently, the Western
Maryland Railway turned over 60

Commerce Commission must
approve all abandonments by the
railways. and it can have a say about
what priority should be given to the
sale _of the rights-of-way for public
use.

Working out the title transfer can
be a legally complicated process,
since in many cases the railways only
have an easement on the land of a
private owner. and that may not be
clearly recorded. Acquisition of the

' land can be a costly proposition, and

in some ways this is the biggest
obstacle to citizen efforts.

According to studies by the Citizen‘s
Advisory Committee, acquisition
costs for some existing trails have
ranged from as low as $375 per mile
to $122,000. Location. ownership.
