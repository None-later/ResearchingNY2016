“Our chief aim Was to get some
practice 'in speaking and
understanding ‘iiving' English," said
Poluysn. "it is a difficult

predicament for a foreign student to .

ﬁnd himself in a' world where he has
to speak Engiish.0ur students did

'their best to adjust their accents.

which was not so easy, because at
our institute we teach them Oxfor
English. In Albany. various dialects
are used by students and teachers.
and in this sense our students

benefited from their studies of

dialects."

“Before leaving for the United
States. l wondered whether i could
ever work as a translator." said
Yevcgcny Kramarenko. a student in
his fourth yearat the institute. “i was
not sure of myself. But after getting
some practice. i realized that I need
not have had so many doubts."

pleased to answer all their questions
about the Soviet Union. lhave to say
that the students here know very
little about our present life in the

Soviet Union. After glancing_

through a few literature course
booklists. i realized that they got
most of their ideas about us from the
Russian classics—Anton Chekhov.
Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Leo
Tolstoy. They hardly know any of
the present-day Soviet writers.
Before our departure. one of the
teachers showed me a composition
by an American student Who had
been studying with us. He wrote that
personal- contact with Russian
students had helped him to change
his stereotyped idea about the
USSR."

“We constantly associated with
the Americans." said Sergei
Kamensky. “Since we were the first

Soviet students in Albany. everyone ‘

was pretty interested in us. We
established excellent relations with
the students of Albany. The
Americans were very friendly and
sociable. We weren‘t limited to
meeting only students and teachers.

“We are indebted to Dr. Charles
