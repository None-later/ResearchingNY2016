Ass Index of Possibilities

by John Christ
Ari Index of Possibilities: Energy
sud Power by “The Catalogue."

Pantheon Press. New York.

(CPS) It‘s always nice to rcad a
book that you can feel comfortable
calling unique when you've ﬁnished
with it. Whatever else may be said of
it. An Index ofPassibi/ilies: Energy
and Power is certainly that.

But it‘s uniqueness is hard to
deﬁne: an encyclopedia. but not
complex or dry; a cultural/ scientific
journalistic endeavor. but not that
limited: an experience. hiit not the
cliche that word brings to mind.
Most simply. it is it collection of ur-
ticles about a wide range of topics

grouped under the general hcuding‘

of “energy and power.“

The book isdivided into scvcn ma-
jor sections. beginning with
“Universe” and traveling inward to
more basic and integral lcvcls
“Earth,” "World." "Body." "Mind."
"God" and “Fundamentals.” Under
each heading a mass ofdigestablc in-
formation is broken down into
coherent and readable parts.

For instance. “Universe” articles
deal with the major cosmological
theories and discoveries in
astronomy. "World" deals with the
history and immediacy of man's use
of energy. “God” explores some of
the main ways man relates to his tin-
ivcrse.

Index covers hundreds of

 
 
  
 
  
 

   

 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

  

 

   

 

 

 

  
  

seemingly unrelated ideas and con—
cepts that many people are exploring
for themselves today: ESP. psy-
chology. the biosphere. life
energies.drcums. drugs. kirlian
photography. gurus. ccstacy. cosmic
influences. relativity and so on.

All of these are presented in a for-
mat similar to the Whole Earth
('umloquc. illustrations. particular-
ly those by Peter ii“ and John
Faust. make the book interesting to
look at its well us read.

The structure of Imlcxullows one
to read it all at oncc.ut mndom. or
topically through use of extensive
cross-reference. in fact. the authors
claim that there iIlL' 842 possible
ways to use the book,

Im/i't' was produced by u collcc-
tivc oi'cight people in London called
“The Catalogue." who claim that.
"thc book wtll ililH.‘ to be its own
definition."

Read from co\ci' to cmcr. an tili-
dci’lying mcssugc becomes clcur:
mun isin tlic midst ofau explosion of
knowledge about it“ facets ofhis cx-
lxtcttcc. iiit,‘ book brings the render
up to tittlcon sonic ol‘thc littcst infor-
mation and points the way towards
how this information can be in-
tcgiutcd into tin overall concept of
where the human race of the planet
Earth is at.

Another insight into the authors"
purpose may lie in aquotc lodged in
the table of contents: “it might turn.
out that exploring the fur-out spaces
of human consciousness is the fastest
way to social transformation.“

Unfortunately. this visionary un-

 

dcrtuking has an inherent problem:

 

it won‘t be long before it‘s out of
date. Alrciidy. almost il year has
passed since the authors completed
the actual writing. the ensuing time
being spent on the mechanics of
publisltiug._

What will last. fortunately. is its
cntcrtuinmcnt value and deliberately
thought-provoking stiinccs toward
what it surveys. These two aspects.
as well its the sheer breadth of its
coverage. should make it a popular
book.

lz'rit'rgi' tllltl I’Ull’t’r is supposedly
the first of live lmluxcs. if the
authors can accomplish that goal
with dexterity of this first install-
ment. they will have really done
