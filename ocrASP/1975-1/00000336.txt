L " A' letics (AMIA), and the Women's

' r'a‘rnurai and REcreation
Association (WIRA). ‘

‘Bmh groups offer co-ed as well as
restricted activities. and are under
the advisement of Dennis Elkin,
Campus Center 356.

:Each is governed by a student
council which makes all decisions
regarding eligibility. rules.
schedules. and any other aspects of
their respective programs. Election
to these councils is a' three-step
process: completion of a written
application, interview with members
of the council. and election to ofﬁce
by current council members.

All student tax-payers are
automatically eligible to participate
in intramural activities, which
include team sports (football. soccer.
volleyball. floor hockey. basketball.
etc.) and individual competition

I (tennis. ping   

kicking. billiards. etc.). I

Any group of students may form a
team for a given sport. it is then the
duty of a member of that team. who
shall act as captain. to attend the
publicized c‘aptains‘ meetings for
that sport. As captain. he/she is
completely responsible for that
team.

Both programs collect bond
money in most team sports. which is
incorporated into the groups‘
budgets by Student Association. and
which is due at the captains
meetings. Bond money is $10. and is
forfeited if the team incurs two
forfeits during the season. Two
dollars ($2)are kept by the group for
purchase of awards. so a forfeit-free
season results in an $8 return.

lntramurals also offers an
opportunity for interested students
to earn money as ofﬁcials of many
sports. with salaries ranging from
$1.50 to $3.00 a game. depending on
the sport involved. degree of
