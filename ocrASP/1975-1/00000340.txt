SEPTEMBER 5, 1975

     
 
 

 

 

 

 

by Lois Goldsteln

Work is under way for the
scheduled completion in November
I975 of the new Alumni House and
Conference Center, to be situated off
Perimeter Road between the Securi-
ty Building and the physical plant.
According to Mr. John Hartley,
Vice President of Business, this pro-
ject, which was started during the
Spring of I975. will serve both the
university and the larger community
in general. The building will be used
primarily forboth studentandalum-
ni conferences.

Containing four conference
rooms. one large |ounge,a library. a
Rathskcllcr, Office of the Alumni
Association. the Office of Alumni
Affairs and a solar laboratory. the
total cost of this project will be ap-
proximately $250,000. The ftinding
for the Alumni House and Con-
ference Center is coming from
several sources (these being money
raised from the Alumni Association
itself and money from other con-
tributors). The Atmospheric Science
Center has donated a portion of the
$200000 it was allocated by the
State Legislature, along with an
equal sum given by the Niagara

Mohawk Power Corporation for the '

experimental solar energy‘section of ,-

the structure. , -
The need for this building aro

from the crowded conditions which ‘ I

presently exist. The most unique
item of this structure is the ex-
perimental solar roof which will
con his the building to be both heated
and cooled by solar energy. For-
tunately. there have been no
problems to date. except for a few
mirror delays due to the solar energy
unit.

Dr. Lewis Wclch. Vice President
of the University state that the
architecture is to be different from
that ofthe rest ofSUNYA‘scampus.
because of the engagement of a new
architect and the employment of a
new design. The exterior is to have
natural wooden-siding. but the
Alumni House and Conference
Center is far enough from the other
buildings so as to avoid any conflicts
in style.

At present, the roof is being add-
ed, and preparations are being made
for an evaluation by the Public Ser-
vice Commission and the At-
mospheric Science Center. which
will soon ensue.

Speaking casually on his back porch.
Saindon reiterated in his own words
the paper‘s purpose which, in part,
formally reads, “To give voice to the
everyday concerns of the ordinary

citizens, the minorities, the un-

mentioned that he‘d rather consider
the paper “a member ofthe loyal op-
position" rather than just another
alternative newspaper. “l'd like to
see a populace flavor“ he added.
When asked about the political
orientation of the paper he noted
that one “can't really place a par-
ticular label on the paper" but he
followed by admitting it is“obvious-
ly a left of center paper“. Saindon
was quick to add however, “we‘re
open to everybody . . . we do en-
courage different points of view."
In comparing The New (‘ilizcn to
"Q

  

   

the now defunct War/lingual Park
Spiril (A‘lbany‘s alternative
newspaper). Saindon ‘saw some
similarities and some differences.
“We‘re startingon the same fina ncial
base as the Spirit. btrt we don't want
to play the same rolc~~-wc want to
appeal to a larger group.“ The 25
year old Saindon believes that the
Spirit fell on too narrow a political
ltne. Thus, becatisc it appealed to
those with a radical student orienta-
tion. its base of support fell as the
