by Marie Iueclfem

I‘m a chick. ldon‘t feel like a chick. but l'm
referredto as one. A chick: a cute fluffy baby
chicken kids cuddle on Easter; a baby bird so
dumb it'd follow a vacuum cleaner if that's the
first moving thing it saw upon hatching.

But there‘s some consolation: I won't be a
chick forever. l'll grow up to be a hen. Feeling
cooped-up i can go to henparties and cackle
with m friends. If my chanticleerwon‘t let me
go. I‘ll enpeck him till he leaves the roost with
the rest of my brood. and l‘lldie a lonely old
biddy. Sounds great.

Oh. you say l’mexaggerating from nothing.
that "chick" is an inoffensive slang expression
commonly used by “hip” men and women
alike—that it‘s a term long divorced from the
baby chicken. Well. a chick is a chick is a
chick. Call me feather-brained. but I can't
separate the word from its original referent.
How can one expect to be taken seriously if
one identifies with. or is identified with an

I adorable but mindless fuzzy thing good for

petting but not much else'lToday many young
women are trying to be taken seriously:
women are trying to change their dumb
breeder image.

Images are hard tochange. They're not con~
crete. but are abstractions that exist in
people's minds. abstractions that are usually
expressed with and evoked by words.
Words...“A rose by any other name would
smell as sweet.” Not so. A word‘s connotative
meaning transcends its denotative meaning. A
chick by any other name  would be a
different entity. One could refer to a 2l-year—
old neighbor as the chick next door. the lady
next door. the broad next door. the woman
next door. This nei hbor could be a Negro. a
nigger. a colored la y. Black woman. You can
change the image by changing the language.

You might say. what‘s the use of changing
the language when it's the attitudes of the peo-
ple ustng the language that need to be
changed? Well. the relationship between
language and cultural attitudes. the use
another chicken metaphor. is like that
between the chicken and the egg. Cultural iii-
titudes shape language; language shapes

cultural attitudes.

The bias in our culture against women has
shaped the language. Many words reflect
women‘s lower prestige. Patron and matron.
Middle English for father and mother, are
used today as: patron...ofihearts; matron...of
a jail or restroom. Govemor...of a state;
governess...of children. Major...in an army;
majoretie...in a drum-corps. The attitude that
women are sexual objects has also colored
words that were originally parallel: a master is
one who rules; a mistress is one who is kept.
Sir...a title of respect; madam...manager of a
brothel. Call-boy...summons actors to the
stage; call-girl...is summoned to bed. .

The word “chick” was shaped by and is
symptom of cultural attitudes. By
perpetuating the stereotype. by putting young
women in their place in a "cool" and subtle
way. the use of the word “chick” shapes
cultural attitudes as well.

I know I feel left out when my psych book
refers to “the chikl...hc." “the student...he."
“the teacher...he." Don‘t “she‘s” count for
anything?And often words such as “man” and
"mankind." which are supposed to be in-
elusive. sound veryexclusive. “Givea kidajob
and help mold a man." readsu subway poster.

Erich Fromm writes that man‘s “Vital in-
terests" are “life. food.access to females." etc.
if “our man in Algiers" asks “the man on the
street" who “the best man for the job” is. the
answer will probably be "a man ofthe people."
or “the working man's friend." A woman is t|
possibility no one considers.

Language is both a symptom and a cause of
cultural attitudes against women.’ Language
can be part of a cure. When a professor uses
“he/she" instead of the continual “he.” i feel
good. I feel included: 1 figure in the scheme of
things. If one finds "he/ she“ too awkward. one
can always change the word to the plural. such
as “students...they." instead of saying “the
best man for the job.“ one could say “the best
person;“ instead of a l2-man jury. u 12-
mcmber one. it‘s worth the effort to
acknowledge the existence of the other half of
the population. And instead ofsaying “chick.”
try saying “woman.”

A Most Considerable
Dilemma

With the beginning of a new nciidcniic ycn r

higher education linds ilscll in a considerable
dilemma. On the one hand we have the social
ideal which developed through the course of
tlic I‘ltitls: not just the linuncinlly caipublc. but
all should have the opportunity to dcvclop
through education. At the same iinic we hit“:
the economic rculit ics ol'lhc niid-l‘ﬂtls which
tlIClttit.‘ austerity. Minority students. for exam-
ple. who may lllt\t.‘ had their first taste of
higher education now fitid themselves in the
position ot losing that opportunity. Wiili ccr-
ltIun collcgc monies running sctircc financial
and programs will inevitably become primc
cttndidntcs for budget belt-tightening. This. in
conjunction with higher costs for university
ices. will lend to it throw-brick to previous
dtiys college for the clitc. collcgc only for
those who can afford it. lnit democratic socic—
ty such as ours this type of regression cannot
thlttlL'rillcd. To be it democracy means to
offer cqutti opportunity for all. not some. All
in our society should have the opportunity to
rise above their station through mental and
moral development. which is precisely what
education is.
_ lo understand the dilemma that education
finds itself in today we need only to look at our
own school. Whereas other issues in ilie nch
seem abstract and distant at times this is one
that hits right at home. One need only refer to
the letter received in the mail last month from
the Dean for Student Affairs. "We have faced
and resolved a major budget crisis which
resulted in a net reduction of the campus
operating budget by some $2 million.“ In the
area of higher education what does this mean
for SUNYA in particular?

Due to higheriind highercosis in the private
sector of education more students have come
to schools in the public sector. such as the
State University system. in hopes of receiving
a good education at a lower cost. At our

programs. In addition. the teacher-student
ratio will continue to increase it clear
designation of a drop in cducntionttl quality.

Some of the answer to this problem in
education is u hilltlllct‘ between private
educational institutions and public
educational institutions. Though hiirdcr
economic times are upon us this does not
mean applicants have to stampede out of
private schools to public systems like
S.U.N.Y. One remedy lies in subsidizing
students to private institutions with some of
ilic funds used previously for expansion of
public education. Some contend that this
would he more efficient and would enable the
filling of already existing but underused
private facilities. Henry Paley. head of the
Commission on Independent Colleges and
Universitiesurgues that the low tuitions charg-
ed by stiitc schools are illusory bargains. ar-
tificially lowered by subsidy and ultimately
paid for by the taxpayer. So part of the solu-
tion is not so much new money for higher
education. but rather redistribution of money
already available.

A Row Deal

Congress‘s recent cut—off of arm shipments to Turkey is a exa mpleof good intentions
gone wrong.

Although Turkey‘s intervention in Cy rus last year surely makes them appear to be
the aggressors. seen from their point 0 view. they were saving Cyprus from a junta
controlled from Greece and thereby protecting the integrity of the original Cyprus
accord oi the sixties. Greece started the crisis by supporting the coup that ousted
Mnrkios. and then its government fell as Turkey came in to counterthe Greek Cypriot
mchment. Greece owes its new democratic government to Turkey.

The reason Congress cited for halting Turkey‘s military supplies was their use
outside of Turkey‘s borders. But by that standard. lsrael too should not receive
armaments. Pressures from the Greek-American lobby isgenerally held responsible
for this inconsistiincy: both Turkey and lethl were acting outside their borders in a
defensive Ithiloll.

lurkcy is not an angelic country. ofcourse. But it 5 use to the United States. NATO
and. for that matter. Israel. has been underestimated. Electronic observation stations
kccp careful truck of what the Soviet Union is bringing into the Mediterranean Sea
through the Bosporus and what they are shipping to the Arab countries. Without
'l'urkcy‘s cooperation. the US. would have difficulty informing lsrael about Arab
military strength. I '

'I'iirkcy‘s political system is closer to democracy than most and the country has been
a loyal American nlly. It is surprising they have tolerated oui abuses this long. such as
when we decided they were the major licroin criminal in the world though they only
grow two percent of the world‘s poppy crop. '

Some of the principles espoused by those on Capitol Hill iisjiistil'icntion forihc urnis
cut-off ni'c lnudublc. but we continue to supply aggressive and dictatorial governments
throughout the world and thus are applying those principles inconsistniitly. ’l'urkcv
cannot licip but to fch singlcd-oiit unfairly. and their rcscntmﬁit will hurt the United
States and. indccd. the entire Western world.

Be Compassionate

Walk Softly

With the arrival of tlic l5.()t)() SUNYA students for the fall semester. the podium

maintenance of u happy. licrilthy podium concrete foundation.

The new l‘iclds administration should direct full and complete analysis to the
possibility of setting up a review panel to study illld Cthitlttlc possible aid to the hard
pressed concrete floor and should issue its report forthwith to the University Senate.
Only in this way can full University participation be felt by all concerned elements of
