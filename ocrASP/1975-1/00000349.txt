State Gotttedm is Icio‘udy with, a

chance of sunshine breaking through
later on inthe season. Coming off a
dismal season of 8 wins and ‘flames.
the Dane‘s coach Dick Sauers said.
“I'm hoping to ﬁnd‘ some new talent
at this year‘s tryouts.“ which are
scheduled for Sept. l3 and I4.
The team‘s two most ac-
complished players. Terry Heath
and Frank Prete. have graduated.
and only three lettennenwill -be
returning: senior Kevin Freed.
junior Jamie Kaufman. and

isophomore Johnny McCoy.

_ A great deal of pressure will be
placed on ‘ these three players if
Sa‘uers comes up empty handed at
the tryouts. .

Snuers. who always emphasizes
teamwork. looks for men who are
willing to pull together and help one
anotherio'ut whenever possible. "In
the long run. a happy and looseteatn
is sure to be superior to a group of
uptight individuals who are only out
for themselves.“ said Saucrs.

This year‘s lirst match will be the

ment Sep During the short golf

continued from page/il'lem
Silverman battle for the starting spot
at second base.

Mark Constantine will be behind.
the plate. backed by Charlie Scheld
and Mike Melzer.

The big question mark. as

Iiurlingame readily adtnits. is the.

pitching staff. Alter veteran John
Dollard. and spot appearances by
Blair and Willoughby. senior Bob
Kronenberger is the only familiar
face. Last year Kroncnbergerwas
the ntunber one reliever. posting one
win and two saves in very limited ac-
tion. but was "very inconsistent.“

Behind the vets are three
freshmen: Pa ttl l)il.ello. Bob Cooke.
and the team‘s lone lefthander.
Roger l’lanticr. “unknown quan-
tities because of lack ol‘experience.“
according to lturlingatne.

“We are not all that polished going
into tomorrow‘s games." conceded
Iiurlingame. "and I just don‘t know
if we‘ll be ready. Certainly. the fact
that the games were scheduled on the
.lcn‘ish llolidays does not help

either. as several of the ballplaycrs
will not be able to play.“

"We‘ve got to be ready by the
Potsdam doubleheader next Satur-
day." Burlingame continued.
“Because after we go to Potsdam. we
host a doubleheader with Oneonta.
and then travel to I’lattsburgh for
two .morc. Those are conference
gatnes. and if we hope to better last
years‘ 9-5 record (good for third
place). we've got our work cttt out'
for us."

ANALYSIS: It will take a lot of
hard work and some luck for the
Danes to repeat their 9-5 perfor-
mance of last year. let alone ap-
proach the I973 Conference Chum-
pionship team‘s marks.

Pitching the Key

Indeed. the key is. the pitching.
You've got to have the horses to be in
the race. and one has to wonder if the
arms will emerge.

One concltules that the (treat
Danes will not he participants iii the
World Series this year. bttt. then
again. they can‘t anyway.

for low enough scores to place them
in theyall-important E.C.A.C. tour-
nament. in lute October.

Back in I963. when Peggy
Mann initiated the Women‘s tennis
team. three girls came to try out.
Now. twelve years later. some 60
enthusiasts flooded the courts and
waited to show their talents.

Tennis is the only women‘s fall
semester interscbolastic sport at
Albany State. Through the years. as
the number of participants has in-
creased so has the quality of play.
with undefeated seasons from l96ll-
I972. v
While last year proved to be
something of a disap-
pointmenl.Coaeh. Mann is op-
timistic about the chances of an im-
provement over last years' 5-5 mark.

Varsity captain Louise Civitt. a
four year veteran. heads the list of
talented returnees. which also in-
clttdes Eastern Collegiate Cbarnpion
Fran Schulberg.

According to Coach Mann. a
talented freshman crop. led by .lane
Maloy. promises to make the season
interesting and successful.

“We have no traditional or great
rival." said Coach Manrt. “We get
out best competition from several
private schools. among them Vassar
and Skidmorc Colleges.“

The annual highlight is the
Eastern Collegiate Championship.
slated for October 3 and 4 in New

’alt7.. with Albany allowed two.

singles and two doubles teams ifthe
players qualify.

The team opens itsscasonut home

Great Danes: What Will They Do For An Encore?

After a 9-0 season. featuring the
nation’s number one rushing

Harriers Face Tough Schedule

by .Ion Lafayette

The Albany State Cross Country
team and Coach Bob Mtlnscy are
training for what Munscy called.
“The toughest schedule any learn in
the school will face.“

“There are no real cream puffs on
the schedule this yea r.“ commented
Munsey. after a practice in which the
barriers ran up and down hills for
tnore than two hours. the equivalent
of l7 miles.

Munsey was itnpressed by the
qulaity ol'the runners trying out this
year.

“No one was falling behind. and
the freshmen were keeping up with
the varsity men." said Munsey.
“Some of these freshmen will be
needed to offset the loss of Vinnie
Reda. who placed fifteenth in the
nationals last year."

Carlo Cherubino. the barriers lone
senior. is back after a sub-standard

The defense suffered tbs loss of

defensive end Rudi Vido. the first
Albany football player to sign a
professional football contract (with
the New England l’atriots).but Ford
is more than optimistic here.

"Our defense may be stronger

than last year." said the man who
created Albany football some ﬁve
years ago. “Sure. we‘ll miss Vido
arid the others. httt we've had a
successlul year. in recruiting

players are waiting to step iii and do

ANALYSIS: lhe Danes should be
tougher than last yutr. and barring
injuries to key personnel. will be
capable of beating arty of their op-
ponents. despite the much improved
schedule. lhe Alfred and lthaca
games are the keys. as they are an
