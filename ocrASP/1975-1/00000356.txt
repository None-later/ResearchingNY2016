Torch For All i f

To the Editor: I ' -

- I was a December I974 graduate of the Un-
iversity. and was listed in the graduation
ceremony program and have my picturein the
present yearbook. However. being a
December graduate and no longer on the
SUNYA campus or in close proximity. l was
unable to purchase a yearbook.

I am disappointed in the manner in which
the distribution of yearbooks irt handled. Ifeel
that a letter should be sent to eachn'December
graduate asking them to sign itand return it to
the TORCH office with the proper amount if
they wist to purchase a yearbook. I realize this
is an expense. however. Idid receivea letter in-
forming me about the senior week activities.

' To the Editor:'

So - why was I not informed about the dates
the yearbook would be on sale. and how I
could purchase one?

I would appreciate a copy of the'yearbook.
Please tell me the cost of the book for an in-
dividual with a first semester tax card. If there
are no onger any books available. I feel the
December graduates should be polled. Then.
enough yearbooks shouki he ordered to satisfy
the December gruduates‘ demand.

We Remember

To the Editor:

Several months ago. Governor James
Rhodes. various officials. and the National
Guardsmen involved in the shootings at Kent
State were found innocent of any wrongdoing.
The inevitable question was: Who is guilty?
Who is guilty'.’

It is bad enough that our system of justice
cannot punish those guilty ofthc crimes com-
mitted at Kent State. but last week we found
that it doesn‘t even have the conscience to
compensate the families who have suffered for
their grief and injury.

To those who have waited and believed for
live long years: We can remember. We can
remember.

We will.

enrolled in the linear algebra course offered
here at SUNYA and am spending the
customary week or week and a half reviewing

Ordinarily I would notbe bothered by a
week wasted in a course. howover this is not
the ﬁrst time I have reviewed vectors. The first
was in high school math. next was in high
school physics. next was calculus here at
SUN YA where if! am not mistaken we went
over that material twice. Next was I’hysics

; Last spring. the Student Association funded
two weekl'of free beer on the podium. ltwent
over well. with most people having a pretty
good time. The major drawback was that it
was done right around ﬁnals time. a period
which ranges from fairly hectic to moderately
crazy.

Wouldn't it be better to have such a prty
week now. at the beginning of theschool year.
while we‘re all still “happy to be back“ and
before the Albany bliz'zards hit?

I thought so. and introduced Bill 75-76] I2
to Central Council. the SA legislative branch
which would have set up “M dtM Week." It
would have meant a week of free Miller(Mon-
day. Wednesday. and Friday) and'Michelob
(Tuesday and Thursday) for twa hours per
day. Initial preparatory arrangements were
made which included the use of two taps to
prevent a repition of last year's lines. Butthe
Council. in its infinite wisdom. defeated the'
bill. I don't see why.

The beginning of the year. while SA can still

afford it. and the the opportunity to meet with
both old and new friends can lead to a whole

A Conversation Piece

 

 

by Harvey Kojan

 

Those of you who are new SUNYA students
have probably arrived on campus with sontc
pre-conccivcd ideas and expectations about
university life However. if one of them is that
you wil be enlightened and entertained by
your fellow students and faculty members.
forget it. We veterans of Albany campus life
know better. flat until recently.wc could never
quite figure out why. Finally. through cxtcn-
sivc research and analysis (plus a couple of
bowls on the side) everything became clear.
And although certain segments of the univer-
sity have tried to quash our findings. we have
pcrscrvcrcd.

Question: Why is almost everyone on this
campus familiar. uninteresting. and dow-
nright horing‘!

Answer: Because everyone says the same cx-
ucl things.

Yes. it's shocking btrt true. When you come
right down to it. yott. your friends. your ac-
uurtintences. and everyone else associated with
SUNYA say the same things and have the
satire raps in the same situation year in and
year ottt.

llalderdush. you say‘.’ Well. we have the
documented evidence to prove our
allegations. Last year we began conducting a
large and comprehensive research project. It
lasted from August 26. I974 to May 26. I975.

l'housands of conversations were randomly
taped. edited. compiled. and processed. The
results: students and faculty are basically
limited to six areas of discussion: sex. drugs.
food. grades and courses. weather. and
vacations (sounds like Jctipardy“und when
you hear this sound. the round..."). Not less
than 92.7% of all the interactions we studied
concerned one of these topics (and the other
7.3% were disregarded and unintelligible.
mindless babbling).

liulldinky. you rcply'.’l suggest you conduct

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

your own little experiment. Carry a tape
recorder around all day and hold it in your
l'riends' laces (they‘ll love you for it). firing it
back to your suite or apartment. listen to it.
and you‘ll hear the same lines repeated over
and over. Such as:

"flow was your summer vacation?0

“What did you get last semester?"

“ I his food sucks.“

“Mun. check ottl that piece over there!"

" II cy. let‘s get drunk. stoned wasted.
plastcrcdmtc!"

“Shit. it’s wirttcr already?!"

‘I'his veal is so damn greasy. younccdlllo
napkins to dry it out!"

"What‘s your major?"

Although those six were the major topics.
close contenders were MUSIC (if I hear one
more word about Springsteen) and SI'OR'I S
(" l'hc Yunkces/ Mctsi‘Jcts,’ (iiants/ Rangers
SllCKl“).

Seriously. when Wits the last time you heard
a discussion on politics. violence. and dis-
corttcnt‘.’ Or perhaps a conversation concer-
ning the Middle East. “0510113 school
problems. or New York City's filttlllClill crisis
(how many people still think the only Ilig Mac
ill the world has two all bccf patties...‘.’)‘l
Maybe even tt cerebral talk on religious ex-
istential philosophy (do you ascribe to the
Ilubcriun or Unamunittn point of view'l).
chcrl

Luckily. for most of you. these few
importnut~to-collcgc-sludcnls-httt-
insignilicunt-in-tltc-wltolc-scheme-of-tlungs
topics will interest you enough to keep you
from art early death. lustcud. you‘ll merely
slttgtltllc like the rest of as. Then. when your
four years eontc to a close. you can enter it
wltole new spectrum of conversation: "What
the hell it") I going to do NOW?!“

Well. there's always drugs. sex...

A Wry FSA. ..

SUNYA‘s system of providing student services is economically advantageous. buta

detriment to its original purpose. Faculty-Student Association (FSA) is a non-proﬁt
corportttion. but a corporation never-the-less. FSA is now efficient and financially
sound but serving the university is distinctly a second priortiy to its own ﬁnancial
health.

Last year‘s mud McCarthy-like attack on everything related to FSA on the part of

some members of Student Association was essentially a reaction to the fact that FSA's
largest constituency. students. had neither complete control nor were the primary
interest of FSA. Whether this is a worse situation than the alternatives is a subject fora
night-long barroom debate. but within the context‘of the present system students

should continue to increase their input and power in FSA affairs.

FSA is dealing with students on gut issues: eating. pinball. barbershops. laundry and

so on. This year will bring some issue or another into public scrutiny. and hopefully
student inﬂuence in FSA will increase as a result. assuming student leaders properly '
reflect the wishes of those they represent. ‘

. . . With Ham and Cheese

For example. the Rathskellcr snack bar no longer serves sandwiches. though heros.
hamburgers and hot dogs are still available. The reason FSA has done this is. on the
surface. sensible: They want to clitninatc duplication between the (‘amptts Ccntcr
Cafeteria and the Snack liar. Now. if you want a sandwich at lunchtime you go to the
cafeteria. and if yott want a hamburger you got to the Snack liar. There is. however. a
problernwltctr the cafeteria is closed. Students wanting night-time snacks cart no
longer have sandwiches anywhere on campus. Dinner possibilities are limited also.

What to do‘! FSA could have sandwiches at the Snack llar when the cafeteria is
closed. But there is an opportunity hwcrc to revive one old Student Association idea.
'I he Sandwich 'I'ruck.

If some vehicle \vcnt frotn quad to quad during the evening making sandwiches.
students would get their sandwiches brick and an added convenience too.

llut the present situation. while not critical isannoying. Only at SllNY Albany is it
impossible to haw a ham and swiss on rye at 9:00 pm.
