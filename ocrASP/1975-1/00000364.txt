The Classical Porn

The emperor Augustus. although married three
times. had only one child, adaughtcr named Julia. He
loved his daughicr dearly and raised her strictly. but
when she reached adulthood shc engaged in much
liccntious conduct. Augustussuffered not only personal
grief and disappointment but also political
embarrassment. especially since he had taken on the
role ofa moral reformer. We can, however. sympathize
with Julia more readily than with her father. who was a
cold politician and in his personal life no saint. In fact.
Augustus abused his daughter from the day of herbirth
to the day of her death.
In 39 BC. Augustus married Scribonia; it was the
second marriage for him and the third for her. A year
later. licensing her of a “contrary temper.” he divorced
her on the very day on which she gave birth to his
daughter Julia. He then married Livia. who atl9 was
already the mother of two sons by a previous marriage.
As .Iulia grow old enough to understand she must have
felt littlc affection for her stepmother.

At the age of I4 Julia. a beautiful. spirited. and
intelligent girl. was married to her own cousin
Marcellus. a sickly boy of l7. We may be sure that

general practice in ancient Rome to marry girls offal a
young age in marriages ofconvcnicnoc. Marcellus died
two years later. much lamented by Augustus; he and
Julia had no children.

In 2! BC. the cmpcror arranged anothcr political
marriage for his daughter. this time to Agrippa. his loyal
supporter and a unpapr statesman and general. Julia
then was l7. Agrippa about 42. To make this match
possible Agrippa was required to divorce his present
wife. Julia bore him ﬁve children. all of whom were to

Julia‘s own inclinations wen: not consulted; it was a _

themselves. At the same time she had extramarital
affairs. Agrippu suffered in silence and died in l2 B.C.

In It B.C. Juliawasmarried to Livia’s son. Augustus' _

stepson. Tiberius. Like the ﬁrst two marriages'this
marriage was part of Augustus‘ efforts toarrangc for his
successor. Tiberius. too. was made to give up his present
wife. to whom he was deeply devoted. Julia bore
Tiberius a son who was to die in infancy. Julia and

Tiberius were ill-suited to each other. and the marriage _

came to a disastrous cnd. Julia gave herself to ,
adulterous pleusurcs. the humiliated Tiberius withdrew. '
in 6 EC. in voluntary cxilc to Rhodes.and Julia castall
caution and shame to the winds.

In 2 EC. Augustus had exhausted his patience. He
banished Julia to the inhospitable island of Pandatcria.
off Naples. She was accompanied in exile by hermother
Scribonia; mother and daughter both had been cruelly
dealt with. each in her own way. Augustuscvcn ordered
that no one was to approach .luliu without his cxprcss
permission and that she was to be denied ordinary
comforts. such aswinc for hcrtahle. "Tiberius interccdcd
with Augustus on behalfof his estranged wife. but the
emperor said that tire and water would mix sooncrthan
she would return to Rome. Nevertheless after five yea rs
her place of exile was changed to Rhcgium in Calabria.
a slightly more agreeable place.

In 8 AD. onc ofJulia‘s and Agrippa‘s five children. a
daughter also named J ulia. was found guilty ofadultcry
and banished.

Augustus died on August I9. l4 AD. and Julia»
before the end of the year. She suffered her ﬁnal
disgrace in deathzhcr fatherhad left ordch dcnying hcr
burial in the family mausoleum in Rome.

I caught the last45 minutes ofthc
Miss America I’agcant on Saturday
night. Being the Bicentcnnialshow.
the least Iicrt Parks could have done
was wear a red. white. and blue
tnupcc. No way. Even having the
judges sport baihingsuits witha map
ofthc U.S.A. would havcaddcd a bit
of class. Instead. thc same banal
music.chorcography. and comments
were all that was broadcast.

Audio visual excitement was left
to thc commercials.which of course
