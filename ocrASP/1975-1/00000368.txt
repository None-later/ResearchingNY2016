prominently the issues raised by the new pa-

tent agreement faculty. staff and students.

throughout the SUNY system are being re-

. quired to sign under threat of possible sanc-

tion.
Research Foundation Counsel Cairo is
guoted in your columns of as saying that the

agreement covers only discoveries that are

novel andysignifieant. but he should reread it.
The agreement deﬁnes discovery as including
“... any art. nrachine. manufacture. design. or

. composition of matter or any new and useful

improvement thereof. or any variety of
plant...” and. says further. that “any and all
such discoveries“...shall be...faithfully and
promptly reported to the [Research] Founda-
tion. The Research Foundation then deter-
mines whether and when to allow disclosure.
Meanwhile. the professorand his students are
held to month of secrecy which is without
limit in time.

Experts in each field taught at this Universi-
ty are able to distinguish the novel and signiﬁ-
cant from the routineand trivial. but under the
terms of the agreement this is decided by the
Research Foundation. not by us. We yield up
the results of our work and then fall silent until
told we may speak.

Counsel Cairo tells us that this is aimed at
people outside the University. which i take in-
cludes the community groups. the Albany
Medical Center and other hospitals. and the‘
very people whose taxes support our work.
Research Foundation policy would deny them
the fruits of our knowledgeand scholarship in
order to milk a littly profit from the sweat of
our labors. This contradicts the Board of
Trustees Policy which says “... the purpose
of University research is to seek new
knowledge for the general benefit and not to
make inventions for profit.” and is the an-
tithesis of the message of our own Com~
munity/ University Day.

Cairo says that many professors “...either
have a very bad attitude toward the [Research]
Foundation or... hate us”. is it any wonder?

To the Editor -

Each year 99 out ofa hundred students pay
SA 33 dollars. Any recognized group can app-
ly for funding with the approval of Central
Council. For the most part the funds are well
spent and this year they proved to be well
rcgulatcd.Still inequities exist.

There are many groups that are more than
just “fun” groups. they are a necceslty to the
university community. The yearbook and the
student handbook‘aretwo such groups. These
groups do riot have personal contact with the
heads of SA as does NYPIRG. instead they
are merely doing their job.

Recently tighter control measures have
beeninstitutedby the controller for the sake of
accounting. This is very good politics. Central
Council adds riders to budgets yet very rarely
consults the groups that they affect. '

These trends of SA wanting to centralizethe
power in the executive branch is good for
order but not good for the groups who merely
want to do their thing.

What I suggest is forSA to conduct anover-
view of what groupsare essential and then run
those groups themselves. or at very least im-
prove communication between existing ones.
instead of groups listening to SA‘s mandates
SA shouldlseek out the groups and listen. It is
the groups that make SA what it is.

To the Editor:

We are writing this letter in regard to Mr.
Levcnson's plea for his bill (75-76/12) which
proposes to set up a week of free Miller and
Michelob with S.A. funds. In the light of S.A.
budget cuts we find this bill untimely. il-
lconceived and frivolous. We sincerly believe
that S.A. funds can be spent more productive-

A?

Although we recognize the need for in-
creased social interaction on this campus. it is
our belief that in thistimc oflimited resources.
the benefits ol'such a proposalare outweighed
by the cost. Funds can and should be spent in
other ways.

Sincerely.

Gotham Goes Broke

 

 

by Anthony P. Bianchinl

Money; power; prestige; influence; a store
of value; a means of facilitating commerce in
complex economies; boon to the avaricious
and the bane of saints—it‘s been called by all
these. Indeed. it is through its exchange that
we secure the niceties we require—roof. food.
education. the wine. whiskey and weed. Decry
it though we many. l‘ve yet to ﬁnd the
merchant who will trade me his bottle of gin
for two hours of my labor—itdoes appear that
this commodity will be with us for a time. It is
only fitting. in deference to its enduring
nature. that we learn to utilize it to obtain the
most satisfaction and freedom from want that
it is capable of providing.

Oddly enough. while we use it daily in our
pecuniary dealings. it appears that those who
use it most understand it least. Conversely.

those of us who have the least of it realize its
value more than those guardians of the public
welfare who squander it as though it were a
resource sans ﬁnitude.

All of which brings me to the point of this
piece - Gotham‘s reputation is tarnished - the
kitty is empty - the banks say no and the tax-
payer is waiting to sign for his unemployment
check.

With our hindsight it would have been pru-
dent for our great City of New York to heed
the Bard‘s exhortation and forsake the
borrowing against tomorrow‘s revenues.

But we can‘t rewrite the past—all we can do
is draw our lessons from it. So Mr. Mayor.

forget the haunting of Sisyphus. take heart -

and recall the words of our great President
who remarked “Prosperity is just around the
.corner.“

Step Down Henry

Henry Kissinger. although he is not the
cause for what has happened in lndin or l’or-
lugal this summer. is the primnry man respon-
sible for the way the U.S. reacts to such inter-
national events. As the Secretary of State he
has been and still is the chief l‘ormulutor of
American foreign policy and the direction it
takes.

For all the greatness and brilliance he has
displayed. though. Henry's time has come.
The time has come for Henry to pack up and
head back to Harvard. Time for Henry to
write his memoirs.

lint isn't he the pcncemnker. the only man
capable of bringing together so many diverse
forces'.’ The recent Sinai accord has restored
his prc:ligc and the world has once again pinc-
cd him on a pedestal. Why should he rcsign‘.’
Beneath this moral facade of penccmnkcr is
the more pervasch cha meter of the Secretary
of State Kissinger thc immornl and ex-
pcdieut man. We have to maintuin dctcntc
with the Russians at all costs. ncvcr speaking
out for human principles. As lndin burned.
and moved from democracy to dictatorship
lhis summer we sat by watching without rais-
mB our voices. As a nu tion aren‘t we capable of
crying out when people's rights around the
world are threatened?

We seem to speak out for rights only when
they fall within our sphere ofinfluencc. 0n the
l4th ofAugust inu speech before the Southern
Commodity Producers Conference in Bir-
mingham. Alabama. Secretary Kissinger
made the following statement in reference to
P°rlul£al2 "The United States welcomed the
Pertuguese revolution . . . We sympathize
With those moderate elements who seek to
build Portugal by democratic means. We will
°PP05e and speak out against the efforts of a
minority (the communists) that appears to be
subverting the revolution for its own pur-
Poses. The Portugese people should know that
we and all the democratic countries of the

' _v‘ Druid 'l‘roegc

  

West are deeply cont. ‘ncd about their future
and stnnd ready to hpr a democratic Por-
lugnl."

Very strong nords. but liberty and human
rights for thc norld‘s people are not a par-
ticular allow. How can he speak up for the
I’ortugcsc )ct ignore the oppression cx«
pcricnccd by people behind the Iron Curtain
and ulso \\ illness the signing of the East-West
Security Pact \\lllL‘ll formally acknowledges
R ussin‘s oppresst grip ovcr linstcrn Europe.

Perhaps the problem is that we suffer these
days lrom political leaders without ideals.
\rithout drcnms. l'heir interest is limited to the
immediate. their \ ision to power. At thccnd of
the Second World Wn r American lenders saw
thcinsclws on a moral crusade of sorts. After
crushing the Nit/i cvil we saw fit to try and
push back Russian communism. Truman and
others pushed lor “democratic. free elections"
in the lilllhllll States, In 1945 we now prepared
to base our policies on higher principles.

e

In I975 Henry Kissinger cnrcs less about
human rights and decency titan he does about
power and short-term political objectives. I-le
sustains the right-wing governments of such
countries as Chile and South Korea. despite
their brutal character. because he thinks them
useful to his policy. And he does not want to
let anything get in the way of his doing
business with Leonid Brezhnev. Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn was not accorded an invitation
to the White House this summer. There was
evident concern in not wanting to "embarrass"
the Soviet Union by such an action.

if we still believe.aswedid in the l960‘sthat
the United States is the leader of the Free
World then we must be prepared to speak out
nnd give hope to llll those people ofthe world
who are not free. if Secretary Kissinger is not
prepared to go beyond his own interests then
one can only say this: step down Henryand let
someone else take your place.

President Fields has told the faculty u...- belies decided thermostats; position.

Moyer ,Hunsberger resigned amidst controversy two, and one’h'alf years ago. The

college has been able to operate without a dean for that period, and thus Fields’action A

appears quite reasonable. , ‘ _
During these years the deans of the three divisions inthe arts and sciences college ~
have reported directly to Executive Vice President and Vice President for 

Affairs Phillip Sirotkin. They are Ruth A. Schmidt of Humanities. Richard Kendall of v .

Social and Behavioral Sciences. grid Vincent F. Cowling of Sciences and Mathematics];
None of the university‘s schools. such as Education. Business. or Nursing. have“
divisions. They have a small enough number of departments and programs to’pernsit ‘

each chairman to report directly to the school dean. who then reports to Sirotkin. ' '

if Fields does not reconsider eliminating the arts and sciences dean. then a new '
structure is required. SUN YA may be large enough tojoin other schools in the'country
in separating those divisions into schools. lf adopted here. there would'bea school or
college for each present division. If continued cooperation between them in such a
separation is not threatened. it could be a viable alternative to the present system.

Within the structure now in existence. the elimination of the college dean requiresa
revamping of many policies and a reevaluation of present decision-making processes.
After all. SUNYA grunts collegedegrees and has college councils. and there are college
programs. Who runs a college without a dean? Will there be some unified voice or
representative for the college? Should there be a rotating “chairperson” of an arts and
sciences governing “committee”? How are college-wide policies enforced?

it is probably possible to create a system to deal with these and other questions. A
decision eliminating the artsand sciences dean changes the meaning and thus the role
of the college. and President Fields should define those changes.

. . .There Will Be Changes

There are other implications of the college dean‘s elimination-."Vice President
Sirotkin has direct control of the college in this temporary situation. and the division
deans have had a somewhat increased responsibility. This structure should not be
institutionalized. The academic vice president should not be involved in the workings
of the separate divisions primarily because he couldn't have time to do both that and
the rest of his duties well. and the division deans should be reevaluated since they were
not appointed to assume responsibility on a university-wide level.

For example. both division deans Richard Kendall (Behavioral and Social Sciences)
and Ruth Schmidt (H umanities) are uninterested in student opinions on and concerns
for academic matters. Kendall will honestly admit that among the purposes of a
university. he regards both research and socialization as being signiﬁcantly more
important than leaching.

Surely President Fields must take a close look at all three division deans. evaluating
their philosophies and attitudes towards all aspects of education. before permitting
them to be institutionalized in positions to which they were never appointed. Though
each has dealt with Sirotkin for a long time (Kendall was actually confirmed when
there was no college dean) there is a distinct difference between the temporary and
permanent situations. Permanence will change the power structure while before there
were only adaptations to a particular power void.

lnstit utionulizution of the present structure without reevaluation and
reorganization could also threaten the integrity of many decision-makingprocesses.

’l‘cnurc cases. for example. go through a college-level council which normally would
make recommendntions to the the college dean. That dean had a say in tenure cases.
which was considered by the president in some proportion to the opinions of the
various other levels in the tenure process. l’rcscntly that council‘s recommendation is
made directly to Sirotkin. who plays the role of both collcgc dean and vice president.
Docs this menu the academic vice president‘s opinion. when fowarded to President
Fields. will be heavily weighted with the authority of both himself and the college dean?
Or should the college council or division deans have increased power? in the temporary
situation of recent years. the arts and sciences dean‘s authority has moved up the ladder
to Sirotkin.

if Fields indeed wants a more powerful academic and executive vice president. he
should say so. Otherwise tenure and policy-determining processes need reform.
