A meeting for all people wishing

The WIRA soccer league. con-
sisting of two teams. will be a best of

ed from Rudy.“
‘ The other end spot is between
Murphy and Thompson.

"Right now they are both battling
for the spot and we'll just have to
wait for time to tell." explained
Ford. ,

The tackle positions will be

handled by Villanova and
Holloway. - 7 . -

“Frank was our number one man
last year and we expect nothing but
the best'from him, and Tiny canto to
camp weighing thirty pounds less
than last year, and can run the forty
'in 4. 95 seconds -“ said Ford.
That's as fast as Bertuzzi. In addition
he has been a trememdous morale
factor."

The linebackers appear to be set
with Ken Schoen. returning to his
spot and Curt Bonnet fighting off all
kinds of competition to earn his.

“Ken is very aggressive in addition
to being strong. quick. and tough,"
commented Ford.

Bennet has looked realgood in the
scrimmages and has fought off the
challenge of senior Brad Kchlen beck
and sophmore Gary Fousek, accor-
ding to Ford.

Four time captain Arnie Will. is

returning to his familiar spot at cor-

_ nerbaek. and will be joined by junior

Harry McDonald.

McDonald was a starter last year
but got hurt and was neVer able to
reclaim his starting berth.

The defensive secondary' will be
handled by Ray Gay. Billy Brown
and Skip Scurry.

According to Ford “they all have
excellent speed and the necessary ex-
perience to he a competent secon-
dary."

In addition, Scurry‘s eight in-
terceptions ranked him second in
division iii in that department.
AnalysiSIWell there you have it.
Even though the Danes lost live
starters to graduation the defense
still looks tough. and it will have to
he with the type of schedule the

Danes face this year.

As coach Ford said.“they will be
tested early —~ in the first two games
of the season."

Dane defense smears another would-be ground gainer In last year's action.'l'he dotanaa
is going to have its work cut out against a tough Altred squad.

 

by Kat Kurt:

Have you recently passed the ﬁeld
between Indian and Dutch Quads
and noticed thirty guys running'
around kicking an’overinflated foot-
ball and tackling each other?

They are not confusing football
and soccer, but are playing rugby.

fall with a thirty-six player roster.
and the team had a fairly successful

Booters’ Quadrangular Saturday

Williams colleges at I pm.

“This will be if very important test
for us.“ said Schieffelin. “as all of
these teams are strong. and play an
aggressive. physical game. the type
that we had trouble handling last
season."

St. Lawrence particpated in hst
years‘ ECAC 'I‘oumament at Union
College. and is highly rated by most
of the New York Division III
coaches.

coming team“ according to
Schieffelin. “and beat Keane State
twice last year. “while Williams is
“one of the hustlingest and best
coached teams we play."

In an article on these pages in the

reported to have been "hired" by the
SUNYA .ludo Club. Daleffio was
not Irircd. bill is merely helping out
as an assistant coachand assistant
instructor with the club and received
absolutely no compensation. accor-
ding lo cltrb member Andy Ross.

“Statements which suggest that
Daleffio is receiving compensation
from the club might be interpreted as
Daleffio giving up his amateur
status," said Ross. “Daleffio is an

amateur and is merely helping us out _

as a favor.“

Ross was mistakenly called the

stead of Carol I'Iatchcr. the real

maiden‘season. A reguhr schedule
was planned for the following spr-
ing. The'team split six games. and
was invited to the Capital District
Spring Rugby Tournament.

The unheralded Albany State
team was placed into the “B” divi-
sion of the tourney, and pulled off a
major upset by taking the chem-
pionship. As Coach Rappauo said,
“We surprised a lot of people with
‘out victory in the Schaeffer Tourna-
merit. but the biggest surprise was
our 25-3 victory in'the finalsover the
Schenectady Reds. who had
dominated play and won the tourney
the year before.”

A rugby game opens when the ball
is kicked off from the fifty yard line
of a 110 yard field. The object ofthe
game is to carry the ball over your
opponents goal line. After
touchdowns. a two point kick is
attempted through the uprights.
After receiving the kickoff. the ftf-
teen man team will run the ball up‘
freid until the ball carrier is tackled.
If the bail goes out of bounds on a
play. ‘touch“ is allied. When this
happens. the teams line up in two
rows perpendicular to the sidelines.
’I'Ite "hooker" will then roll the ball
between the two teams. and the light
for possession is on.

Once a man is tackled with the
ball. the scrum is formed. The
“serummen” (linemen) of each side
will from a huddle. and without the
use of hands. must kick the ball back
through the "ruck" to the serum-
hack. When he picksthe ball up. the
scrum breaks up.and every player is
an eligible receiverofa lateral pass as
the team move's downfieid. No
forward passes are allowed.

There are two forty minrrte
periods and a two minute half-time.
If a player is injured. he cannot be
relieved by a substitute. He has two,
minutes to recover. orhe has to leave

@ 

the field. arr-ear- itclttde a referee
and two mam. "

.After the genre, the two teams get
together and have the traditime
post game party. Sometimes it ialna'
local “pub”. but if outdoors. it is
more a picnic affair. ' '

“It's the only sport I know of _
where a great emphasis '- placed on
comradeship". said Rappeuo. It’u
great feeling to go out drin king alter
a rough game and sing the
traditional. perverse rugby songs
with all the guys of both teams.“

The schedule which Albany faces
this year will be tough aceordingto
Rappazzo.

“After this season, we'll know
where we stand. and whether we an
play with the tough competition
we'll face." We believe we have a
good team with several good players.
Wences Rodrigues is our best scmm-
man. and we have some ﬁnd looking
scrumbaclts in Chris Brown. Bob
Goldberg. Pete Rizzo. and Joe Mc-
Carthy.“

Everyone is welcome to the party
after the game. and we hope a large
crowd shows up for our games.
because all athletes like ,to play in
front of a crowd." Rappauo eon-
eluded.

Rugby games are played on the
football practice fields Saturday
afternoons at one o'clock. The first
home game is Sept. 20th. a "grudge"
match against the team "founders".
the Albany Knickerbockers.
