Siena Clouts Danes, 7 -2

by Mike Piekarskl

Freshman Dave Smith powered a
two-run homer and doubled in the
go-ahcad run and teammate Kevin
Nevins spun a three hitter leading
Sicna to a 7-2 victory over the Great
Dane varsity baseball team at Un-
iversity Field. Wednesday.

With the gameticd 2-2 in the sixth.
Smith lined a one-hop shot off the
leftficld fence to drive in Gary Hello
from second with what proved to be
the winning run.

The loss left Albany at 0-2 on the

season with all ofthe State Universi-
ty of New York Athletic Conference
games yet to be played.

Siena struck first in the second in-
ning. After Dane starter John
Dollard—pitching on two days‘
rests—had retired the Indians l-2-3 in
the first. Tom Paradise led off the
visiting second with a base hit up the
middle. Smith then sluggcd a 2—1
pitch over the leftficld fence. to the
right of the 330-foot marker. to put
the Indians into a quick 2-0 lead.

Dollard appeared a bit shaken and

cluding a Fulton-Montgomery
penalty kick saved by Albany‘s
goalie, Henry Obwuld.

“Our team play was generally
good." said Bootcrs' coach Bill
Schicffclin. “but we still have to
make some changes and im-
provemcnts.

Considering we were doinga lotof
experimenting at different positions,
things went fairly well.”

According to Schleffelin. the
visitors provad to be stronger than
expected.

    

"We knew they had a good. solid
squad. but they \vere stronger. more
poised and disciplined than ottr
reports had led us to believe." ex-
plained Schicffelin. “All of us were
really impressed with them."

As for the Bootcrs. Sch ieffelin was
particularly pleased with the perfor-
mance of Aguilar.

“That kid's a winner and a
hustler." said Schicllelin. “He has
the sense for the net and goals that
we needed last year. He's already
shown us a lot. and if his perfor-
mances remain at their present level.
be will probably start."

Schieffelin alsoisuid the defense

ty. and most coaches agree it will
take a very poised and well disciplin-
ed team to win there.

The Saxons are coached by a
legend in his owntime. Alex Yunich.
Yunich sports a career mark of I75-
94-I l. ranks fourth among win-
ningest coaches in college football
today.

Last year the Saxons limited their
opponents to 7.3 points a game and
only l53.6 yards a game total
offense. Of equal importance. the
Saxons lost only two players to
graduation.

The stars are All-East defensive
end John Van Guru and left
linebacker John Peterson. VanGura
is very quick and strong. and Ford
calls him their bestdcfensive player.
Peterson at 6 feet one inch, 205
pounds is a very smartteam leader.

Alfred plays out of a basic 5-3
defense with multiple adjustments.
The key for Albany is quickly
reading the different tipoffs given by
the defense.

Danes‘ coach Bob Ford believes
this is 80 per cent of the battle.

“Our quarterbacks tnust be ready
to receive and alive the ball very

 

to. In addition. they throw the foot-
ball well.“

Alfred‘s ground game will rest on
the shoulders of seniors Tim O'Neill
and Frank Yorio. Yorio. the
fttllback. is a strong. powerful
runner. and. while not exceptionally
fast. is a deceptive and effective
runner. according to Ford.

Greg Thomas. the Saxons out-
standing wide receiver. has been
shifted to quarterback. and there are
some questions as to whether he has
enough experience running the
offense. Ford. expects a “very. very
difficult game. but one which the
Danes certainly are capable of win-
ning.“

Analysis:Albany must take it to
Alfred early and set the pace. The
crowd and atmosphere at Alfred are
factors which must be ignored by the
team on the field. or the Danes will
fall, as have so many others.

The key will be defense. Can
Albany run through Alfred. and can
Albany out-defense the top defense
in the nation? The question is better
left to the men in the purple. gold.
and white on Saturday than to
speculation now.

Ithaca: The Big One

by Nathan Salem
and Craig Bell

The chant. “We‘re number one"
may become a reality Saturday.
September 20. when the Albany
State Great Danes host the Ithuat
Bombers in what Danes'Coach Bob
Ford calls. “the biggest game in
Albany Strttc history.“

Never before has the number one
learn iii any NCAA Divisioncome to
Albany. or evctr met a Gran Danes
squad. but tomorrow. number one
ranked lthuctr plays number six
ranked Albany State at I pm.

Last week the Ditties faced l974's
top Division III defense at Alfred
and were winners by a l9-l3 score.
but Ithaca and Alfred are Worlds
apart. according to several coaches
who‘ve seen both squads.

"Their offense is awesome." says
Ford. Last yettrthe Ilornhcrsuvemg-
ed 40.3 points a game, rind they
rolled right over St. Lawrence in
their season opener last week. 20-6.

The Ilonrbers copped the 1974
Lambert Trophy. the symbol of
supremacy in the East. and were
number two III the nation behind
Iowa Central State.

The Bombers. like Stutc.ureu tri-
ple option offense. but they operate

out of the "I" formation.

Quarterback Jerry Boycs. a 6 foot
2 inch I90 pound senior. ran for 158
yards and three touchdowns last
week and is extremely capable of
running the offense. In addition he
has a strong arm.

According to Ford. his split end.
Ilill Bryant. is an excellent_
reeeiver."Hc has great bands to go
along with his blaring speed." said
Ford.

Like to Run

The running game will be handled
by ltalfbtrcks Dave l’itzer and Bill
Carney and fullback Alan Howell.

“Ithaca likes to run inside with
power and just blow you right out of
tlterc.“ explained Ford.

“Our job will be to continuously
give them different looks on the cor-
ner and stop Boyes from tuming up-
field." We have got to ma kc them go
to the lllf and then see what happens.

“If we ltold them to twenty points
we have II fighting chance."

“On defense we ﬁgure Ithaca to try
to chntain. try to squeeze us in and
try to out slug us."

“Tltegoperate out of the basic pro
4-3 defense and they do have pro
size." said Ford. “We will be giving
away an average of thirty pounds a

comment fromthe Arts and Science
faculty to determine how he should
organize their college.

As President Fields sees it. there
are three alternatives to the problem
of structuring the A Jr S College:

The ﬁrst choice. according to
Fields. would be to “leave things no
they are now. but strengthen thr
three divisions within the college.“
The three divisions are Behavioral
and Social Sciences. Humanities.
and Science and Mathematics.

Secondly, Fields says he couH
“organize the A & SCoIIege so that it
conforms to the demands of a
college. which would include the in-
troduction of curriculum re-
quirements." At thistimeitwould be
necessary to appoint a dean to the
college. “The way the College of
Arts and Sciences is set up now.“
says Fields. “it just doesn't hold

together as a college in the
traditional sense of the word."

The third alternative. as he sees it.
would be to “make colleges out of
each of the three divisions. at which
time the division heads would be
come deans of their own college.“

President-Fields says the reasons
he originally announced that he
would not appoint a dean to the A &
S College are that "the cost is high.
and the benefits are not clear. There
is no real college. excepton paper.“

The A & S College has been
without a dean for more than two
years. The last Dean was I. Moyer
Hunsberger who resigned in May of -
I973. Since that time, the division
heads have worked directly with
Vice President Phillip Sirotkin in
deciding academic policy.

Sirotkin says that at this time he

 
 
  
   
    
  

 
  
   
    
 
  
 

 
 
    
   
 
  
   
   
 
 
  
 
    
   
    
   

    
    
 
 
 
 

 
 
  
  
   
 

Dean of Soclal and Behavlorat Seleneee lllchard Kendall.

doesn't want an A & S Dean. “The

President‘s decision was a sound
one.” said Sirotkin. "and I will con-
cur with it.“ He feels that the posi-
tion of A CL S Dean is superﬂuous.
and says he has been operating very
well without one for the past two
years.Ricbard Kendall. head of the
Division of Behavioral and Social
Sciences. echoes Sirotkin‘s sen-
timents. “The relationship between
the Vice President and the Division
heads has been very satisfactory.“
says Kendall.

Has the A St 5 Dean been missed
by the faculty? “Yes and no." says
Kendall. “some have. some haven‘t.
President Fields' inquiries should
determine how the faculty feels and
what should be done. That‘s the
main item of business now—to
define the A 8L S College and decide
what to do with it.“

As yet. Fieldshas not formally in-
itiated the process of polling the
faculty. Exactly how he will do this

has not been disclosed.

Should the President organize the
A a S College so that it meets his
criteria for a bona fide college. a
dean will have to be chosen to
preside over the college. The Search
Committee for the Artsand Sciences
has already recommended a dean to
Sirotkin. selected from the can-
didates that the Committee has in-
terviewed for the position.

Because of Fields‘ decision not to
appoint a dean. the mndidate
selected by the Search Committee
has not been informed of their
choice. Sirotkin declined to reveal
who was picked for the job because
he feels it might “reﬂect badly on the
other candidates.“

The three candidates were:
Seymour Geisser. Director of the
School of Statistics at the University
of Minnesota; George H. Stein.
professor of history at SUNY
llinghamton; Ivo Lederer. professor
of history at Stanford University.

 

Albeny'e Great Danes face tbelr grealeel oh

man on the line so ourjobisdelinitc-
ly cut out for its.“

“They‘ll probably try to stop
DeBIois. contain Griffin and
Sowalskie. and make Bertuui run."
“I think you‘ll see us go to the air
more just to keep them honest."

According to Ford. the key to
Ithaca‘s defense is their middle
linebacker Ron DiMurtino. “who is
their spiritual leader and loves to
hit.“

Defense tackle Larry 'Czamccki.
the Bombers co-captain who missed
last Week's game against St.
Lawrence. will be back. At'o foot]
inches and 250 pounds. Coacle

IIutterl'ield considers him a definite
pro prospect. and Ford considers
him their best lineman.

Analysis: In a nutshell this is what
the whole I975 Great Dane football
season is all about.

If the Danes beat Ithaca. chances
are good that the Lambert Trophy
might find its way to Albany State.
In addition. the Danes could find
themselves in the Stagg Bowl game
vying for the national Cham-
pionship.

Couch Ford just sums it up
perfectly: "What a challenge to be
playing the number one team in the
nation."

allenge when they play Ilbace'e Bombere tomorrow.
