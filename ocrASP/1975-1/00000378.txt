Saturday: Country Stomping Bluegrass

by Alan D. Abbey

There still are some groups play-
ing lively danceand swing music that
aren't named Disco Tex and the Sex-
O-Lettes.Theyaretheeountry-rock-
hillbilly-bluegrass groups that today
form a distinct subculture on the
rock scene. and this Saturday at 8:30
Sier'ia College will present two of the
best of the genre. the Nitty Gritty
Dirt Band and the Chris Hillrnari
Band.

The opener is the recently formed
Chris Hillman Band. lts namesake
has impeccable country rock eredcn-
tials. Originally with the Byrds. he
one of the founding members of the
Flying Burrito Brothers. one of the
pioneer groups of country rock.
When the Burritos broke up a few
years ago (they reformed recently
with two original and a passel of new
members) Hillrnan went into the ill-
fated return of the Byrds.

Imported Jazz

For several years now. it's been
either: “Frank Zappa and the
Mothers of Invention. featuring
Jean-Luc l’onty". or “llrin/ri'
(Wu/curl. by lilton John. featuring
Jean-Lire l’onty“. or even
“Mahavishnu Orchestra. featuring
Jean-Lite l’onty.“ By the spring ol
[975. Jean-Lite l’onty decided it was
time for a change. lltoirglit quickly
turned intoaelion. and the violin vir-
tuoso from Home decided to split
from the sttecesslul Malnnishnu
Orchestra and do a record and tour
on his own.

His music isa combination oi ia/l
and electric rock. which is leatiircd
on his new solo album. U/tu/i l/lt’

The album features l’ati'ice Rushen

drums. and Ray Parker and Don
Sawyer on guitar.

They have something to offcryou.
"They." are Gil«Seott Heron with
Brian Jackson rind the Midnight
Band. Their offering is singular. a
unique combination of
revolutionary poetry with music that
inspires a mood. One never loses the
poetry in the music or the music in
the words because the Midnight
Band plays poetry.

Music is the medium through
which they are able to reach the
masses and they do so rather
poignantly. The product cannot be
likened to other bands or poets who
have tried to accomplish that which
only (iii-Scott Heron and his band

' have successfully ma naged—an ar-
tistic synthesis. The Midnight Band
will perform for your listening
pleasure on September l9tlt at the
Palace Theatre.

been a success. Since his ﬁnal years ‘_, ’

of high school he has reached status

in New York City as a fine blackj
revolutionary poet. but seeking to,

reach more people has led Heron
into musical pursuits which he has
likewise accomplished with the com-
petent assistance of Brian Jackson
and the hand.

Heron is a talented and creative
spirit. so put aside any fears you
might have that his music suffers or
is lacking. His message is put forth
with a mellow combination of per-
cussion. bass. keyboards. and ﬂute.
You will seldom hear their musical
poetry on the radio. not because it is
unworthy. but because the stations
are afraid to play it—it is not
footstomping or ﬁnger snapping
mtrsie. For those whoattcnd thecon-
eert. it will he a revolutionary ex-
perience. if you accept the “offer-
ing."
