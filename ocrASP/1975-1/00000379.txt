Judith—Judy Collne (Electra)
Will Judy Collins become the Bar-

. bra Streisand!~ of folk music? One

_' might be tempted to think so after
listening to her latest effort. Judilh.
It is a commercial, slick album that is

old-style Judy Collins the folk-singer
with a guitar. But the answer to that
question is deﬁnitely not.

Collins has grown, rather slowly,
to" be a wonderfully unique per-.
former. Judith is a marvelous blend
of old and new, original and styledl
songs that have a1 been stamped with
Collins‘ personal mark of excellence. 1

“Why do I think l'm dying
sometimes ‘in my dreams/l see
myself a child . . ./Searching for
myself/Searching for my life . . .“On
Judith. Collins has achieved a new
level of depth and maturity in her
original pieces. Her lyrics are more
poetic than mere words for a song,
and they could easily stand alone
with the grace and beauty of her
delicate imagery. At her most
thought provoking and elusive
("Houses") she is reminiscent ol'Joni
Mitchell. Her beg original song.

the sky."

Her choice - of songs to recreate is
quite wide, and serves as a showcase
of the versatility of her lyrical. ex-
pressive voice. They range from the
Stones‘ “Salt of the Earth." to the
hauntingly lovely “Send in the
Clowns" (from the Broadway
musical A Little Night Music); and
from the Depression tune “Brother
Can You Spare a Dime" to the new-
clmic "City of New Oriana.” She

Other than that small complaint, the

Judith is a magnificent album. Ina

She is trying new things. and she
succeeds beautifully. She is the
“Singing bird/(With ntinboWs on

I’ure Desmond-Paul Desmond
((111)

Since the end of World War 11,
Paul Desmond has been immutany
associated with the Dave Brubeck
Quartet. For over two decades. Des-
mond played alto-sax for the quartet
and wrote the group's most famous
piece, "Take Five".

'I'oday though, Paul Desmond is
on his own. it's been that way for
over seven yeats- and in that time
he has only done some session work.
primarily with guitarist Jim Hall.

shows herself to bejust as competent
in one style as in another. She was
able to make the transition from the
sixties‘ folksinger to the diversified
sound of the seventies withoutlosing
popularity. or quality.
Unfortunately. in her growth. she
has been leaving behind some
elements that once were staples in
her performance. She has cut down
her playing of the guitar to an ab-

ing her piano-playing, which is o '

they ﬁt her voice. the main instru- _

 

  
  
  
  
 
  
   
   
 
  
 
  
 
     
 

 

Through the pcrnitent coaxing of
Hall. Desmond returned to doing
public performances. It was during
September of last year that he played
his ﬁrst show on his own at a Town-
to nightclub. He was accompanied
by Ron Carter on bass, Connie Kay
on drums and a Canadian session
guitarist. Ed Bickert. .

The end result of those shows is
the recent release ot'a solo album by
Paul Desmond. entitled Pure Des-
rmmrl. The title is quite descreptive
of Desmond‘s pluying~~ a clean.
even. pure sound. The eight selec-
tions chosen for the album include
jar]. standards such as Colcl’ortcr‘s
“Everything I Love“ and Duke
lillington‘s "Warm Valley“.

The performances by the
musicians is cohesive with a strong
interplay between the guitarand the
saxophone. llickcrt‘s playing is ex-
cellent.

“Ed llickcrt is one of the most

CIJI’BTC .

Bickert justifies any such com-
pliments with this opening solo on J.
Kern/J. Mercer‘s “I‘m Old Fashion-
ed”; his tone and fluency in the guitar
are superb. As with the old Bruberk
Quartet. Desmond enters into a
form of conversation. this time with
a guitar rather than a piano. This in-
terplay betWeen the sax and piano
was one Vol' the strengths of the
Quartet ] Ed Bickcrt has managed to
re-open this form of musical com-
munication with Pauchsmond.

Throughout the remaining songs,
the two aitn at maintaining this rap-

port. as in their interpretation of,
l)jungo Rhcinhardt‘s “Nuagcs”. and '

C.Wi|liams “Squeeze Me".

An important facet of the success
of the album is the strong work of
