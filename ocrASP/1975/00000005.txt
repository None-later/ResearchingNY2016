escrrbe  outloov .f 'New ‘ork b _. k. Governor Cdrey’s
' message it no _ ate's economy is in for
e.-The-Governorjerivi its a $1 billion deficit for

, warned all New Yorkers that they should expect higher
aid for the coming year in an effort to avert the impending

mpaigti‘ that there'w’oiild be noincreases in state taxes,
re ‘ re none scheduled. Ho‘weverﬁue to sharp cuts in state
m pro erty‘tax rates are'expected to soar. Leading the list of
e tax increases .is education. . ._ ,

Th h ate.university system has already lived for a year on what was termed a T‘no-

 growth budget." SUN Y.Albany effectively scrapped all plans for podium extensions,
" and new facilities. SUNY College at Old Westbury was denied their request to initiate
1 new programs in the social sciences. ' ‘

Despite the “no-growth budget". SUNY overspent by $4.25 million. money which
Carey was forced to pay from his deﬁciency budget. thereby further reducing the state's

’ chance for-reaching a balanced budget next year.

School 'aid will be redaced. and the only place where the slack can be taken up is at
the local level, which means higher property taxes. One Nassau community expects the
rate to increase by 38.8%. The squeeze on the localities will probably be more than they
can bear. New York City. despite its A rating for solvency. faces over a $l25 million
deﬁcit this year. and a greater one next year.

The Legislature wants no part of a budget bill that would cause the property tax back
home to soar; it simply isn‘t politicallyexpedient . Thequestion that remains is how the
legislature will balance the books without causingsufferingat the local level. They have
ﬂatly stated that they will not accept an increase in the gas tax. and will not tolerate
higher property taxes. The Legislature will be of little use in the months ahead if only
because the Senate is Republican controlled and is chaired by a female Democratic
Lieutenant Governor. The political shenanigans that will dominate the Legislature‘s
session will leave little time for tackling the pressing issues of our state.

Carey seems to pin his hopes on an upturn in the nations's economy, assuming that
when the country gets going. New York will get going along with it. The waiting game
may be a long one. and in the meantime. Albany and Washington will be playing a
zerossum game where Ford tries to stimulate the nation‘s economy. while Carey tries to
depress his cum.

With the message clear that New York is stuck for the duration, it would be wise for
education leaders to dig in for the long haul and to count on a dwindling source of
revenue and a diminishing enrollment of students. We have to play Carey's hand and
hope he doesn‘t make tracks for Washington in I976. However. reaction from the
Capitol is equally clear: Carey will have to come up with a more workable proposal
than simply shifting the entire burden onto the shoulders of the fragile localities.

. . . and the State of Education

in politics. the name of the game is patience. State conservatives can now smile with
smug satisfaction because the conservatively packed Board of Regents has issued one
of the most regressive and short-sighted policy statements in its jaded history. The
conservatives bided their time. and slowly. they turned the Board of Regents from a
group of educator-administrators to a gaggle of political ﬁunkies.

Encouraged by a number of upstate State Senators. most notably Richard
Schcrmerhorn of Newburgh. the Regents announced that except for New York City
and Long Island. no school district need integrate their school systems, despite orders
to the contrary by Education Commissioner Ewald Nyquist. The Regents apparently
reached this decision without Nyquist. who now faces the alternatives of either
continuing to press for integration. or knucklingunderto political pressure. ifNyquisl
persists. then the Regents are free to ﬁre him. a move which New York‘s conservatives
would greatly appreciate. lfhe succumbs to the pressure from the senators. he will have
effectively relinquished his post anyway.

We strongly support Commissioner Nyquist in his ﬁght against the arcane Board of
Regents. When the Board begins taking orders from senators who obviously have no
strength in the ﬁeld of education. all of the state‘s citizens suffer. It would be the
bittcrcst of ironies if New York State. long considered the leader in progressive
education. now took the lead in enforcing archaic. regressive and racist policies.

in Washington:

Student Loans Threatened

 

WASHINGTON - A recent study has
concluded that more and more young people
are defaulting on their federally guaranteed

student loans. and that report has provided .

new and potent ammunition to congressmen.
senators and White House aides who want an
excuse to disembowcl the program. More than
half a million students have obtained college
educations with the help of these loans.

The study projects that the government will
likely lose some $20 million annually in
defaulted notes. about one half of one percent
of the total amount guaranteed, and about
half the cost ofa single CSA transport aircraft.

The problem is that those who are
strangling abdominrtlly are the ones who are
asked. or forced. to be the lirst to take in still
another notch. Thus it is that Social Security
and medicare and medicaid recipients.
students. and others living on slim. fixed
incomes are the ﬁrst to be asked to sacrifice
still more.

And that brings us back to the recipients of
guaranteed student loans. The four volume
study (which. incidentally, cost the Ofﬁce of
Education 980,000) found what most
educators already knew: that the recipients of
these loans tend to be students from families in
middle and lower income brackets, and are
people who for the most part would not
receive formal education beyond high school
were it not for this program.

Richard L. Tombaugh. executive secretary
of the National Association of Student
Financial Aid Administrators fears that
“some banks will be more careful now in
making loans to the kinds of students who
could default.“ Federal ofﬁcials are already
suggesting higher loan standards, and similar

> “solutions” will come from state ofﬁcials you

may be sure.
The result: those who need help the most
could become those to whom help is denied.
A careful reading of the “80,000 study.
however. suggests a different course. The

 

 
 

by Ron Hendren. ..
study shows that defaults for students
attending public and private schools
(let-reared about threefold between I968 and
I972. while claims from so-called
“proprietary” schools increased a whopping
700 per cent in this same period. This latter
category includes trade schools. secretarial
schools. management training schools. and a
host of other generally small institutions.

Could it be that many of these schools are
l'Iy-by-night operations. the kind which otren
are advertised on matchbook covers. the some
slick operations which hilked so many
veterans in an attempt to siphon ol't' (Ll.
beneﬁts? Could the high default role be
because these schools often ask students to
sign a full contract before the recipient has it
chance to spend a semester determining
whether the institution is able to further his or
her career?

This is one of the points raised to me
recently by Robert M. Pickett. legislative
director of the National Student Lobby. But
l’ickett goes furhtcr. "Because it is generally
the poorer students who default. it is generally
the larger loans which the government gets
stuck with ,“ Pickett says. “i don‘t believe that
any student, however poor, should be put in
the position of hocking himself up to his neck
to meet educational expenses. Before a
student should be allowed to borrow more
than $l000 ayear. we should be certain that all
other sources—part-time work opportunities
and the like—are exhausted."

The outcome of the legislative battle that is
sure to ensue over the future of the guaranteed
student loan program will hinge on how
effectively these arguments are made, for the
program though successful is by no means a
sacred cow immune to congressional
slaughter. It it dies. as that expensive study
made clear. there are quite literally hundreds
of thousands of young Americans who will
never have the chance to get beyond hill“-
school in pursuit of formal education.

“Faith is when you believe something that
you know ain‘t true." —the schoolboy
“Our belief in truth itself. for instance, that
there is a truth. and that our minds and it are
made for each other—what is it but a

passionate afﬁrmation of desire. in which our,

social system backs us up?"

“The tragically earnest meaning of your life, is
quite lied out of you, hya world sunk in lies."
v’l‘homas Carlyle. Frederick the Gran!

On December 22. M. lied. It was his first
free lie. that is to say. it was absolutely
unnecessary. He told it precisely because he
could apprehend nojustification for it all. His
lie had been simply a response to a seemingly
innocent question. the answer to which he
knew perfectly well. But the lie just conic to
liirtr. He was. in a manner of speaking.
inspired. The correct answur had been “Yes”
but M. had quite simply said. “No.”

The lie had gone unchallenged. no doubt
unnoticed. It had nothing of the dangerous
hovering about it, nothing to callattcntion to
itself; it had not been outrc or even very
interesting. M. was. after all. just beginning.

   

. Faith

His initiation into the mysteries was a pleasant
experience but the pleasure had sifted through
him in a few hours after the telling. notduring
the act itself.

He told his second and third lies the next
day. Whereas the second had been deliberately
experimental. the third had been slightly
compulsive. It had been a.ridiculous response
to a naive question of some importance but he
had framed it in a tone demanding its serious
reception. It was accepted without the
slightest suspicion. Elation swept over him at a
chance taken and won. but he felt it slight pang
at not having raised the stakes.

When he left his ofﬁce that evening he was
eager for his next opportunity. He even
considered victimiling a friend over the
telephone but he was ableto wait until the next
day.

His next dozen duplicities confirmed his
calling and consolidated his confidence in his
capabilities. His friends became much closer
to him when he dispensed an occasional
ﬂattering remark based on a foundation of
quicksand. One of his business associates. L..
patted M. on the back. took him aside and
spilled all his secrets. M.‘s acquaintances
found him entertaining and called on him

 

frequently. His social obligations soared.
Invitations to parties. receptions. soireea and
fashionable seances piled on his desk. each
opening the door to a dozen or more victims
who'begged him for comfort. He comforted
them. He consoled themasa Zuni witehdoctor
might console a Methodist missionary by
abdicating his welmnshuuung. his entire myth
being in submission to the doublecrosaed
scapegoat. They invited M. back.

He soon indulged in reinforcing lies. lies
intended to shore up a previous lie. They
proliferated. Several attractive young wives
acted notionny possessive toward him. One
made overt overtures. M. lied to her
ﬂagrantly. She purred.

His lies beca me moreand more complex. By
the end of January he found himself prey to
gnawing doubts: Will anyone ﬁnd me out?
Have l slipped up'! A sudden attack oftcrtiary
paranoia kept him bedridden to all social
invitations for nearly a week. He was in over
his neck. He resolved to maintain a certain
consistency at all costs.

On February I. M. purchased a large lined
ledger. headed every other page with the name
of someone to whom he had lied and recorded
those prevarications he could recall. He soon
commanded a good degree of order over an
already complicated netwark of duplicity. A
few days later. he announced his recuperation
and accepted his social obligations. quickly
becoming the sine qua mm of all the local
social functions. l’eople tested him
infrequently but they were always satisﬁed.
Latent suspicions dissolved to dustballs

began to rely on him. ﬁnding his lies gave their

lives cohesion. even glimpses of mea’
