Tricks and Tramps

by Henry Jacobson

Do you find yourself frequently
taking finesses that fail. resulting in
not making your contract? If so. then
perhaps you are either taking too
many ﬁnesses. or just not the right
ones. for instance. in today‘s hand.
declarer has a choice of two finesses,
one of which he must refuse. the
other he must take. Before looking
ahead to the solution, do you ﬁnesse
on West's opening lead of the two of

spades. ie..play low from dummy.or ,

pop the King?

On the surface. the questiOn might
seem trivial. However. there is a very
logical reason for refusing the finesse
and playing the King. '

Looking at all four hands we can

see dcclarer has a fatal weakness. ‘

That is. if East ever gains the lead. he
will lead a club through. if he is on
his toes. and you and your contract
will suffer agonizing defeat.
(Agonizing. only because the hand
can and should be madc.)Therefore.
we must. at all costs. kccp East out of
the lead. in other words. if we play
low from dummy on the first round.
there are two cards. the Ace and
Queen. which will gain East the lead.
The play of the King. on the other
hand. gives East the lead only if he
has one of those cards. specifically.
the Ace.

After the King holds, the rest is
easy: finesse diamonds until the
King appears. if despite your ﬁne
play on the first trick East never-the-
lcss produces the Ace. you must
hope he holds the Ace of clubs and
King ofdiamonds as well.

For those players with E.S.P.who
can guess the location ofnny card at
will. the lesson in today‘s hand is of
little value to you. For us lesser
players who do not have that unique
ability. 1 have the following piece of
advice: Only take iincsscs which
work.
