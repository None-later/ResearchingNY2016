of sinisty step, addressed for the Gay Nineties and a Sherlock Holmes
hat at a switch hi, all oontriired by a dance troupe that announces its
corporate status mitt title can make an audience very suspicious.

   
 

When Eledroniellody Arts Incorporated, an Albany based non-profit

‘mmy of dancers and musicians, performd “Parachute to a Weather

Balloon”‘on January 20 there was a way for them to tramcend this suspicion

‘ and use their gimtnicltery, gadgetry and talent as a bridge to the audience and
to human feeling. ' ‘

’ Sometimes it happened.

In “Parachute” the first of three compositions, all choreoyaphed by
SU NYA dance instrudor, Maude Baum. children,in riightshirts fresh off the
line. ran to make a communal bed from what started out as a parachute but
became many other things as the evening progressed.

The third selection, “Weather Balloon" evolved intoaformal ball. Dancers
coupled off with other dancers aswell as with other balloons in a mimickry of
the social arts. Lovers, enveloped in each others arm shook their hips in
afﬁrmation of their ability to “get it on” while those on the dance floor
remained unimpressed. A wallflower picked at her dress until she was swept
off her feet by a substantial mass of gas and rescued from the embarrassment

of it all.

    
   
 

Too often. however, the dancing was distant. It was beautiful and
imaginative. but still somewhat cold and menacing.

It was partially due to the overabundance of extemals: the parachute. the
balloons, the balloons pushed out at the wrong time. the band costumes. the
English Dance Hall singer who came in as an “Interruption”, the washtubs,
the clothesline and the nightshirts. Some were essential to the art of the
production. Too many weren't.

And partially it was a result of situations over which Electronic Body Arts
Incorporated had no control. The Main Theatre of SUNYA‘s Performing
Arts Center was half empty because of bad timing’and [lack of publicity. It
was a subzeroevening; one thatdomandcd a certain closeness which was not
evident onstage.

But largely the mistrust came from the way the production lent itself to
over-analysis. The audience tried too hard to save itself from beingduped.

“The sound is really bad. 0b.. maybe it‘s supposed to sound like a crystal

ball. Like Auntie Em to Dorothy in the wicked witch‘s castle."

“I don't know. I'm too worried about why the band is popping out of the

orchestra pit.“‘
“Is it supposed to be a dream’l'“
“I don't know."
“Is that balloon supposed to be floating in the audience?"
"Yes. . .I mean no.“

’Does that mean something?"

"I don‘t know.”

‘You don't know!“

Jail is jail. Truel All jails serve the
same purpose. However, techniques
vary greatly, especially when you
compare jails in the north to jails in
the south. I have had the privilege
and the bad luck to experience both.
In this particular case. let's compare
the treatment of prisoners awaiting
court action.

Prisoners awaiting court action in
New York State have it good. That
is. good compared to the some
prisoners in North Carolina or
Alabumii. thn a prisoner in New
York enters a county jail to await
court action. he starts out being
stripped of it“ his clothes.
(Theoretically these tire kept for him
until he is released. lwent to Rikers

Island once, which is New York
City's biggest center of correction.
When lwent in. lhad somewhere in
the area of one hundred dollars
worth of clothes. The day l was
released, the only thing left in my
box was my underwear and my
shoes.) After his clothes are taken he
is given a shower and then given
another set of'clothcs which may or
may not fit properly. along with it set
of sheets and ti blanket and a towel.
Now in Nassau County. after the
shower and issuing process, a
prisoner is taken to :1 tier that is es-
pecittlly for the new arrivals. Here he
spends his first twenty-three hours
locked in ll cell during which time he
is examined by a doctor. After this
first day the going gets a little easier
for him.

If the prisoner is a felony offender.
he is transferred to the new building.
This building is equipped with elec-
tric gates. windows that nobody can
see into from the outside and which
don‘t open. The - temperature
remains at sixty-five degrees all year
round. They have radios, but you
can only listen to the station they put
on. They have televisions that you
can watch only lifter the last meal on
weekdays and after the second meal
on weekends. In the summer time.
you go to the yard twice a week and
in the winter time you have indoor
recreation twice a week. On either of
these occasions you can obtain

' books from the library. All the rest

of the time you spend on the tier
playing cards. But iiftcrthe first two
weeks. youget (I little tired ofplaying
curds. Then all you can do is look at
each other and be happy.

Now the food is pretty good. I
only found it couple of'worms in the
spinach one time. So ovcrtill. lhc
food is pretty good. The only thing
is. you eat breakfast zit five-thirty
a.m.. lunclizit ten-thirty. and the last
meal comes at four~thirty in the
afternoon. So if you just Ctlmt: in off
the streets and you haven‘t got your
money straight yet. or you‘re one of
those guys that nobody comes in sec
(and there tire a lot of those kind of
guys in jail). you have to go from
four-thirty in the aftcmoon to five-
thirty in the morning without
anything lo out. A guy can get pretty
hungry before he locksin tll tcn p.m.

Now busiiicsswisc, the jtiil is
amazing. There are more loan sharks
in Nassau County Jail than thcrcairc

in the towns that surround it.'Say
you just came man the streets and“
you get to‘the new building on a
Monday. Out of luck! They fill out
their buy slips on Sunday. and get
the merchandise on Thursday. That
means you have to pull ten of those
long four p.m.s to live-thirty a.m.s
with no commissary. This is where
the loan shark comes in. There are
usually one or twin on every tier.
This guy will give you its many packs
ofsmokcs. coffee cakes or ringdings
as you wont. The only thing is you
have to pay him back two or three
for every one you borrow. So ifyou
borrowed thrcc packs of smokes.
that meant you owed him ninc. If
you fztilcd to pay on the first time you
went to commissary. the amount
doubled to eighteen. Failure to pay
this could result in your being
seriously hurt. Even so. they had
nlcntv of customers.

So I don‘t guess this jail was too
bad. lmcan outside ofthc fact that if
you were not a physical brute. you
stood tl pretty good chance ol‘gcttinj,y
a little abused. and the way they
made you get it haircut and ii shave.
even if you were only going to be
there a few days (they didn't huvc
professional harbors either). things
nin pretty smoothly. You got a
clothing change once a week. linen
change once a week. it movie once :1
week and shower every night if you
wanted one. So how could a prisoner
complain?

Misdemeanor offenders got the
slime treatment as the felony
offenders with two exceptions. the
gates on their tiers were not electric
and they stayed open until lock-in
time. and they ate in the mess hall
where the stilt and pcppcrwns. In the
new building the gates opcncd before
and after every meal and stayed open
approximately five minutes. Now if

My ﬁrst arrest in the south was in

They didn‘t lilkc my clothes or my

"section" which is what lcalled it. It
smelled terrible and looked even
worse. IN THE DARK! One of the
gzitcs within this section opened and

beds in this cell and it was at the most
