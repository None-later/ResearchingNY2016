People Sto‘rt Pollution

by Grace Jordan
All types of people. Doctors and lawyers.
Vice presidents. professors and store
managers. Mothers and fathers. cops and cab

We pollute by burning leaves. by driving
untuncd cars, by lettering. by wasting,

electricity. by dumping garbage into the ,

things we can do to light it. The first is to
