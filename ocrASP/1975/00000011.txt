IpNUARY 24, 1975

 

'by Bruce Mush

The Albany State Swimming team
traveled to Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
over intercession totrain for the
latter half of thescason. It was slight-
ly reminiscent of Gulliver in the
Land of the Giants. Stacked against
big jock farmboys from the South
and midwest, the Danes looked like
they might as well pack up and go
home. Fortunately, the eight days
down in the sun were spent working
out, and not in competition. Swim-
ming against those larger and faster
swimmers was a source of inspira-
tion rather than discouragement.

After going their own ways for a
few days the team returned to
Albany a week early for six days of
lwo-a-day workouts. This brings us
up to the present. All ofthe rigorous
conditioningduringintercession will
be put to the test to marrow, as com-
petition resumes with a meet against
Bridgcwutcr. at 2:00 pm. in thc Un-
iversity pool.

The l-3 record from ﬁrst semester
does not seem promising, but onc
must remember that this is not lhc
same team that was being beaten
back in December. Couch While
uppcars to be having a good deal of
success in encouraging improve-
ment. There also is a spirit of com—
rudcry which seems to positively
enhance enjoyment of and,
therefore. success in this sometimes
tedious sport.

Freshman Dave Rubin is showing
a lot of promise in the middlc and
long distance freestyle. His capacity
to push himself in workouts. us well
as his ﬂexibility and feel ofthc wutcr.
iiich mndc him it top contundcr in
New York State.

Dave‘s older brother, Mitch. is
another bright spot for the mom.
Mitch hits ulrcildy mudc notional
qualifying time in the gruelling 200
yard butterﬂy and should be It con-
sistent winner in that stroke.

Dun Dudlcy. last season‘s high
scorer. should continue his slrcccss
this year. Hc is the [cums most \‘cr-
stitilc swimmer, but cxcclls in lhc
ZOO-yard brctistrokc und the zoo-
ylird individual medley.

Rick Mnsom is lhc lciiln's liIstcsl
sprintcr ilnd bitckstrokcr.itlld will bc

Summer, Refreshed  I»

a key man in those events and as
anchor in the relays. I

With the exception of injuries to
sprinters Mike Volpc and Steve
Bookbinder, the team is in top con-
dition. Coach White hopes that in-
dividual times will drop at the
Bridgewatcr meet. Whether or not
these times will be enough for a win
remains to be seen.

The swimmers are among the best
conditioned athletes in the school. It
can be enjoyable to watch races that
are well executed. Come to the meet
and participate in the experience. It
might be fun.
