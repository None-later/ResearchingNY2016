last/Tuesday to face-Williams-
. college. The Danes hadn't played s
5 Vanity contest at home since

' “Cuban 'tat’e Netball-titan

  

December l4, when they handed

Buffalo a Ill-94 defeat.

It seemed. likely that the home
court advantage would be an incen-
tiVe for the 6-4 Danes. However,

‘. Williams College dominated the
, boards throughout the game and

Albany was faced with their ﬁfth loss
in the last eight attempts.
The Dane slide began at the

' Capital District Tournament held

December 27th and 28th at Siena.
Albany was humiliated initially by
the home Indians l04-80. The Danes
had trouble in the consolation game
against R.P.l. but managed to es~
cape with a 83-78 triumph. The Dane
problems in the tournament were an
absence of offensive rebounding and
poor defensive pressure.

Albany allowed Siena and R.P.l.
to establish offensive movement.
thereby ﬁnding the good shot. The
Danes were not balancing their
offense by slowing down and work-
ing for their baskets. The team was
sloppy and forced many poor shots.
The Dane rebounding statistics
reflect the won-loss record to date.

Albany traveled west to face
Hamilton. Buffalo State. and
Fredonia. Coach Sauers wanted his

players to slow their play and con-7

ting on junior Tom Morphis to con- _
tribute some badly needed reboun-
ding help. '

Hamilton College took advantage
of the ﬁustered Danes with good
shooting and a tight defense. Albany
left with a 95-80 defeat and an unsure
coach. Sauers found that his players
were guilty of the same mistakes as
before. The defense was awful and
the squad was forcing poor shots
without rebound position.

The game at Buffalo State was a
welcome change; the Danes showed
what they could achieve with a
slower offense. They used excellent
movement to clear the high percen-
tage shots. The result was a 88-78

victory. This gave the Danes a 4-0
SUNYAC record and a possible turn
around from the previous three
games.

On January 13th. Albany faced
Fredonia State. The Blue Devils are
annual national leaders in team
defense. Doc Sauers knew that
Fredonia was supposed to be having
a “rebuilding season“ but he con-
sidered the Danes an underdog for
this contest.

Albanysuffered with poor shaming
(29%) and couldn‘t move the i‘
ball into the Fredonia zone. The
Danes were unable to pressure the
deliberate Blue Devil offensive
strategy. Fredonia took only good
shots and' were patient until they
cleared theshootjpg lanes..

Doc Sauers commented that the
Dane defensehas been improving
with the games against Buffalo State
and Fredonia. He feels it was unfor-
tunate that his squad had such cold
shooting hands against Fredonia..
The ﬁnal score of 63-48 indicated
that both teams stressed defense.
The Fredonia squad was a more
patient offensive unit than Albany.
The Danes relied on low percentage
shots without moving the ball
around the perimeter. .
Williams College is the latest in-
dication of the Dane weaknesses.
The 75-7] loss 'was due to poor
rebounding and a bad selection of '
shots. Gary Trevitt went 5-H and
was unable to function as a ﬂoor

leader. The only reason that the
Danes were so close was the high ac-
curacy of their shots. However. the
shots being taken were a poor
percentage variety.

The Danes cannot rely on outside
shooting to win ballgames unless
they consistently hit55-60% of their
attempts. The team rebounding
needs work. Perhaps Tom Morphis
can still add the needed board help.
The bulk of the change must be with
Pete Koola at center. and the two
guard positions. Thebackcourt must
take better shots by penetrating to
the basket. The Dane opponents are
capitalizing on defense by grabbing
rebounds before the Albany player
can move into position.

Albany must slow down their
offense and allow the front line to es-
tablish a position under the basket.
This means eliminating the fast
break until the team becomes dis-
ciplined to play as a unit, not as ﬁve
separate entities.

The Danes host Southern Con-
necticut tomorrow evening at 8230.
They must control the reboundingin
order to win. This is a crucial test for
the Danes. They have to gain con-
ﬁdence in themselves as a cohesive
team. The schedule ahead features
important SUNYAC teams in search
of a conference championship. The
Danes cannot remain as they ureand
expect to compete with the likes of
Potsdam. Brockport. and Onconta.

Pups Outclass Williams

by Mike Piekarskl

Avenging their only loss of the
season to Morrisville last weekend,
the Albany junior varsity basketball
team reeled off the ﬁrst ten points of
the game on their way to an easy 84-
60 clobbering of Williams College
this past Tuesday.

Steve Pass‘ l7 points led all
scorers as he hit from all over the
court. Aubrey Brown tallied I6. The
Pups arenOWsporting a 6-l slate and
have anygpp'o’rtunity to post the best
won- ost record ever in their history.

Carmelo Verdejo. who missed the
season-opener at New Paltz. started
at center in Coach Lewis‘ line.-up,
with Eric Walton and Brown at the
forwards, and Pass and Ray Gay at
the guards. 0n the opening tip-off,
Williams controlled the ball. but a
Pass stealand layup opened the scar-
ing. Gay‘s two layups.a shortjumper
by Pass, and a Gay-to-Verdcjo
backdoor play put the Pups up by
ten before Williams could even catch
its breath.

The lead was chopped to 13-8 a
few minutes later but that was to be
the closest the losers would come.
Gay then popped in a short jumper
and Albany was offand ﬁyingagain.
Williams was continually hindered
by the sloppy passing of their guards.
resulting in quite a few Albany
steals.

With the score 19-10 and the ﬁrst
period only half over. Williams

decided to use a zone-defense in an
attempt to stall Albany's penetra-

tion. It seemed to be successful for a .

time as the Pups were not getting off
the good shot; but Williams was not

exactly tearing up the court eitheru

Both teams began to get careless in
the last few minutes of the half
before the Pups scored five points in
a row. to open up a fifteen point lead.
Williams last glimmer of hope came
when Brian Harrison hit ajumper at
the buzzer. making the halftime
» score 38-25.  '

On the opening tipoff of the se—
cond half. Verdejo slapped the ball
to Pass who made an excellent driv-
ing layup. and was fouled in the
process. His 3-point play, which up-
ped the lead to 4l-25, seemed to take
all the starch out of Williams and left

no doubt as to who the victor of this.

contest would be. Albany was
penetrating at will. getting three and
four shots at the basket, and kept ad-
ding to its lead. Two Brown offen-
sive rebounds and baskets, a Walton
free throw. and a Verdejo layup offa
Guy pass upped the margin to 22
points. A nine point burst
highlighted by two Walton jump
shots and three point play by Brown
gave the Pups their largest advan-
tage of the day at 63-34.

From there it wasjust a matter of
what the ﬁnal score would be. End to

picking up ll points. Brown added
to his team-leading rebounding total
by picking up 14 more. Albany out-
rebounded Williams by a 5840
margin which Coach Lewis called
the Pups “best rebounding effort of
the year.“

After Albany‘s opening day win at
New Paltz. the Pups won their next
tfour games in a row before bowing to
Morrisville A&T. The four victories
included: Anny. 89-70; Albany
Business College, l07-9l; Hartwick.
9l-73: and Mohawk Valley, 67-62.

Lewis cited the Pups‘ triumph
over the Army J.V. as the “big win"

' ’"thus far, as Albany trailed by ll

ointsat the halfhcfore coming back
strong in the second halfto win going
away.

The coach. however. was not as
happy with the win over Albany
Business College. “We scored well
but our defense was poor.“ said
Lewis. The Hartwick game saw a
slight improvement in the Pups‘ all-
around play. Lewis picked the
Mohawk victory as the Pups best
performance. “ltwas our best played
game of the semester.“ he said. “We
ran our offense and our defense
played well.“
