' l‘l’h’e Buckley File

The principle behind the Buckley amendment is quite solid; all it really does is apply
the Freedom of informationiAct to education. Students will now have the choice as to
whether or not they will have “open” ﬁles. or “confidential” ones. The original bill,
unamended. would have permitted students to see recommendations and references
that. when written. were expected to be closed to the student forever. it would have
been ‘ unfair to the professors who wrote them to permit students to seel the
recommendations. and claims of “student rights“ in this regard are little more than
disguised curiousity. ’ _

One wonders. after looking through the bill in detail. whether the new law Will make
any difference to most students. Since many professors will insist that their
recommendations be conﬁdential and many students will “close” their files With a
blanket waiver of rights, the “open” recommendations will be few in number. it should
then be pointed out that many references are no surprise in the ﬁrst place. so we are left
with only a slight change in what students know about the ﬁles. I

But there is more to the bill than this. For the first time, there is an assertion that
students have rights over what is contained in their records. They will know,without a
shadow of doubt. who is getting to see their ﬁles since they will have to. release them in
writing each and every time they are sent out. The minor inconvenience this might
cause is nothing compared to the importance of knowing who knows about you.

The loopholes in the bill are disturbing. lfgovcrnment officials want to use them in
evaluating schools. they may. it is worded vaguely enough to thrill even the most
experienced politician. "Evaluation" can mean downright anything. But this is nothing
new. indeed our system counts on new interpretations of old laws for change.

Students seeing their records report one or two things of some interest. but overall
nothing exciting. They cannot view recommendations and the like but can see
transcripts. correspondences already received. and all sorts of little formsthcy‘ve filled
out and material relating to their application (if someone wrote something to the
school without telling you. it would be there).

All in all. a good bill, but nothing to scream and shout about.

Padded Payrolls

Talk ofa tuition increase has spread completely across the SUNY system. There is
now little doubt that SUNY central. along with the Board of Trustees. has been
planning a tuition hike to further drain the students in an effort to balance their own
inflated budgets. Members from within the Board confirm plans are in the works fora
hike. though no one will confirm whether the increase will take the form of a board.
room or tuition raise. Further confirmation comes from Lieutenant Governor‘s office.
which is a somber warningthat Governor Carey may abandon his campaign pledge not
to increase tuitions.

That there is a discrepancy between the money the state gives to SUNY and the
money that SU'NY Central shells out for the indiVidual campuses is not in doubt. The
solution. however. is not as quickly apparent.

it has always been the policy of the Board to raise the rates to cover the debts. but no
one has apparently bothered to seek another way to ﬁnd‘ an answer. The costs of
running theSUNY system are absurdly high. Estimates range that from 34%10 44% of
the education budget goes to the administrative bureaucracy while some 36% goes to
such educational ends as teaching or library services. in all but the most conservative
estimates. this places more money in the hands of adminstrators. Deans. Secretaries
and stenographcrs than in the classrooms.

This unneccesary waste of valuable education dollars is the true cause ofthc budget
gap. SUNY Central alone employs a staff of 600. When new facilities are completed
with a capacity for l200 employees. therewillsuddenly bca need for l200cmployccs.

The solution to the money shortage is in cutting the enormous fat from the middle
management level. An investigation launched from the Governor's office into the
purpose and justification for the enormous administrative tangle will doubtless reveal
the useless paperwork and the pointless desk-jockeying. whose only goal is in the
perpetuation of the bureaucracy. Herein lies the path toward sparing the students a
$400"cost-of padding“ increase.

Changing the Grading System

Now that everyone has received his
transcript. for better or worse. it seems a good
time to examine the system by which otir \vork
is evaluated. To me, it is a flawed grading
policy. without enough precision and
spccii ‘ity to be equitable.

it seems that with little or no increase in the
work done by teachers. we could employ a
system that is as accurate and fair as any
system can be expected to be.

First we should examine the present system.
its highest grade is 4.0, which signifies "A"
work. immediately a flaw arisc There is no
allowance for different types of “A” work.
After all. there iirc five possible letter grades:
A.|l.C.l). or ii. lint there are only four number
ranges: 0.0-1.0. Iii-2.0. 2.0-3.0. 3.0-4.0. And
there is equal unfairness in the other grade
ranges. We have all bencfittcd and or suffered
by the fact that tltc highest "ll" Work is
represented by the same number as the lowest
possible “ii” work.

It might be argticd that cvcryonc's luck
balances ottt. that we get the same number of
good breaks as bad. bitt why leave that to
chance? There are it few steps that could be
taken to alleviate the inequities throughout
the present system.

Vliirst. scrap the 4.0 system and replace it
With a 5.0 system. That would assign each
grade it ntimbci range between 0.0 tinti 5.0.
Now “A” work is not represented by it single
number. 4.0. but by ii range. 4.0-5.0. This
pattern will hold throughout the settle of
gritdcs. "it" work is in the range. 3.0-4.0 “C”
work is from 2.0-3.0. "I)"work iii frotn Lil-2 0
and “ii” work is from 0.0-1.0. . n

Of course there are some problems. lnii i
