enjoyment . in college lies in
I. your ability is use time wisely.
lnorder to have fun while getting the
most out of these years, you need to
establish a pattern ofgood study habits
v and skills. Such habits and skills will
help you get the necessary work done
as the months and years go by, and you
will handle exams with a minimum of
stress and a maximum of achievement.
Authorities in education generally
agree that successful preparation for
an examination starts in the beginning
of each term. Two overall steps are
suggested:

1. Make a term study plan

2. Use good review techniques

At the beginning of each term
develop a daily schedule that allows
time for class preparation, study,
review, recreation, eating and
sleeping. Your ability to adhere to the
plan willbe a measure of your success.

A ‘ study area, conducive to
learning, is important. Make sure it
has good light and all the tools you will
need.

Study and reviewdifferfrom each
other. As they are equally important.
allocate time for both in your daily
schedule. Study refers to learning
new material for the first time. Review
is critical because it strengthens the
retention of this new knowledge.

Forgetting takes place most
rapidly immediately alterlearning.
Review and recall, therefore, is more
effective .soon..after.~ study.4_ Following
each class go over the main points for
10 to 15 minutes to reinforce them in
your memory. This makes reviewing
for exams latera quicker, simpler task.

Don’t overtax your memory or
stamina. Research shows that most
people can absorb and retain just so
much knowledge at one time. It's
important to learn day by day, week by
week. But each period of study
scheduled into your work plan should
be no longer than 1 or 11/2 hours,
followed by some kind of recreation,
meal or other activity.

Take legible class and study
notes. Mark the margins and
underline your textbooks throughout
the term and you will be able to review
for weekly quizzes or final exams with a
minimum of strain.

Student .
Efficiency

If you have applied yourself during
the term, then preparing for exams is
largely a question of review. The time
needed is not as extensive as some
students think—provided you have
been working consistently. Review for
weekly quizzes should take no more
than 15 minutes, a mid—term hour
exam 2 or 3 hours, -and a final
examination 5 to 8 hours.

Your preparation for a ﬁnal
should be carefully scheduled into
the' two weeks prior to exam day.
Organize a schedule that does not
interfere with your regular study for
on—rgoing classes. Beware of racing
your motor. Make sure you still allow
time for rest ,and relaxation with no
longer than 1 or 11/: hours of review at
one time. Your mind needs breaks.

Plan your review systematically
and consistently. Go from main idea
to main idea, using the textbook
chapter headings or your instructor's
term outline as a guide. Go from
chapter notes to chapter notes or from
class notes to class notes, recalling the
important headings and ideas in each.
If certain points are difficult for you to
remember, THEN reread the textbook.
Otherwise stick with your notes. Don't
plan to learn something for the first
time.

Making summary notes is often
helpful, depending on the amount of
the material to be reviewed. In 4 to 8
pages you can outline the main points

 

of your detailed class and text chapter
notes. Headings with indented
numbered points under them make
relationships more obvious. This
procedure will also help reinforce the
major ideas and important details.

Summary notes can also serve as
a self—test toward the end of your
preparation for exams. Put a sheet
over each page and slowly uncover
the first heading—~see if you can
remember the main points underit. As
you go, ask yourself what, when etc.

Try to predict the exam questions.

Be alert throughout the term to the
emphasis instructors put on certain
topics, aspects or ideas. They often
give clues to points that are important
or particularly need review.

Ask your professor what he
recommends for pre—examination
work. Use his commentsas a guide but
don't try to outguess him.

Group reviewing can be helpful.
But__it shouldn't take the place of
working“ on your own. Limit

is'cu‘ssions of significant points and
possibé"test questions to 30 or 45
minutes, with no more than 4 or 5
people. ,

Avoid cramming. If you have
followed a regular schedule of study
and review, you should not have to
cram the last day. Remember,
forgetting takes place more rapidly
right after learning. If you do have to
cram, be selective. Don't attempt an
exhaustive review.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

JANUARY 28, 1975

4an.......... ~'_. _._ ..__— ‘

I’ll'gtve you $60  an
‘A’ in RCO 265. . .

by Ed Pierson (CPS)

 

ome exam time, most students
C throw away idealistic notions

of learning and bear down on
the real business of school: grades.

An economics professor at Denver
University capitalized on this
competitive syndrome by injecting
some free market theory into his class
last quarter. He sold grades to the
highest bidder.

Professor Mike Rock raked in almost
$2000 in a grade auction where the
average "A" went for $85, "B" for $55
and "C" for 5535.

Nearly 90% of the students present
in the class participated in the auction
of grades rightup until the day after the
bidding when the professor revealed
that it was a hoax.

ln a recent interview, Rock said, “In

retrospect, 1 wish 1 hadn't donehitk
ressing'

precisely because it was so debK
to see how easy it is to manipulate
students." "

'The bizarre tale unfolded like this:

One day last quarter the economics
professor walked into class and said:
"Look, you people have won . , . I'm
going to sell grades. Grades wtll go to
the highest bidder. If you people are so
happy with the market process, why
don'fwe just let the marketdictate who

" . The Great
" Grade
Auction

gets what."
Rock told the class he would sell a

is .....¢o . Jaws 2:22;: a. U . m... . . 

One other shrewd business student, ,
noting that a number at students were,

absent from the auction, bought up all
of the C's1 and D's. He planned'to
advertise them in 'the campus
newspaper and sell them at a profit.

While he didn’t advertise, the
student did spend fifteen minutes in
class the day after the auction trying to
sell the grades at a 300% profit.

After paying $86 in cash for an A,
another student asked Rock, "Do you
think you’re going to get another
teaching job in this country? You're
going to be blackballed from every
university in the country."

Students in the class were so
convinced that Rock was serious that
many stopped studying for the final
exam and others tore up their papers.

On the last day of class, Rock
explained that he had not been
serious. "How could you be so absurd
as to believe you could get away with
something like this?" he asked them.

When asked why he believed Rock,
one student answered, "Look. you're
an authority figure and as an authority

certain number of A's, B's, C's and D's, agure we take what you say at face

that payment was due within three
days, and that those who didn't want to
buy grades had the option of taking a
"withdrawn passing" (WP) grade.

An impartial auctioneer, another
faculty member was brought in by
Rock as he told students that he himself
could not "in good conscience" sell the
grades. The auctioneer stood up in
front of the class and began, "Whatare
the bids for an A?" The first bid was
‘MS, The bidding went on and the
grades were all sold.

Several members of the class
objected to the selling of grades and
proceeded to go to the department
(fllrlli‘mdn, dean of the busmess school
and acting dean of student life.

Some objected to the proposed
grading system mainly because ll was
not 111 the original contract of the class
Others said that it was blackmail to pay
for the class twrce,

One busrness major who consulted
a lawyer, said that he was not opposed
to the selling of grades as long us if was

student initiated," but was opposed to
the fact that Hock told them they had to
[my grades, That was "coercion he

said

 

value,"

Another member of class, after
hearing if was all a hoax, tried to keep
Rock to his contract and force the
money on him. "We made a contract
yesterday," he argued. "Here's my
$80. I want my A!"

Rock noted that no one attempted to
obtain a WP in the class, that ultimately
the money made no difference in the
grading, and all the money was

rammed! 'On'ly"“$86 in caslruwas‘

actually collected. The icinamder was
in the form of notes.

"It's so easy to convrnce students of
almost any thing," said Rock. "My God,
If that's education, then the
educational sy stem is more messed up
thy .i I thought If was.”

Explaining his reasons for intitiating '

the scheme, Hock said, "For nine
weeks I attempted to engage the
students In a LflrllLJQLlL-E which most of
them refused to be engaged lit."

l writifo have thought everything 1
(lid for those nine weeks would have
led them to believe that I'd be the last
person in the world to sell them
grades."
