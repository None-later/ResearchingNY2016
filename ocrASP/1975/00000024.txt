Band is not the new sound of the ’

i seventies. Neither is it the hope and

‘ salvation of American Music. What '
they are is a hilarious mixture of
song. dance. “a lot of laughs and
twice as many jokes."

1' The SSWB is seven guys from
Mother Albany—rhythm 'guitar,_
banjo. percussion. string bass} elec-
tric Violin. electric guitar. and elec-

. tric bass—who get up there on the
' stage and enjoy themselves. They are
all excellent musicians.'even though
they don't place a lot of emphasis on
their music. ~

Their major stock in trade is
parody. Attacks were launched on
everything xfrom country/western.

bluegrass version of ELP‘s "Oh.
What A Lucky Man He Was“?)and
soul. to Lawrence Welk. the Big
Bands and the classics (“La Merde:
Prelude to the Afternoon of a
Horse“). They did a great job on
Beethoven: a syncopated. clockwork
version of the “Ode to Joy" portion
of his “Ninth Breakdown“ that look-
ed just like a window display in
F.A.0. Schwartz.

All thiswa's interspersed with'_ L

jokes, puns and some acting—all
terrible. but all the more funny for

it—-and the audience, despite their.

groans. loved every minute of it.

Down south. audiences til the Bot-'

tom Line and My Father‘s Place are
busy being amazed by a bright rising
group: Hello People. It may sound
more like a greeting than the name of
a group. but they are four ofthc ntost
entertaining musicians to be seen in
quite a while.

Their act employs greasepaint,
pantomime and acapella renditions
of several fifties tunes as comic in-
terludes,while their music takes care
of tile rest.

On stage. Hello People handle
themselves well. possessing the abili-
ty to create almost spontaneous rap~
port with their audience. They have a
light. original sound. due in part to
their producer: Todd Rundgren.

But credit must also go to the ex-
perience and versatility of the
members themselves. They‘ve been
around for nine years and were never
very successful. Now. though. with

Warhol’s ‘Dracula’ A Biting It

ll» ' in t r

by CS. Sentlno ,.

“The blood 'ofthcsc whores is kill-
ing me!“ complains Count Dracula.

Count Dracula has met with hard
times. He‘s losing weight. His skin
turns paler by the day. His greying
hair requires a touch-up job in the
morning. You see. the vampiric
nobleman is addicted to virgin
blood—he‘s got a but on his back. if
you will—and he‘s finding fully in-
tact young females an increasingly
scarce commodity these days. It‘s
cold turkey forthe Count.and unless
he sinks his teeth into “virgin meal“
before a fortnight. it's the end ofthc
line.

At least that‘s the way it is in Andy
Warhol‘s “Blood for Dracula
(publicized as simply “Dracula"). the
sequel to his “Frankenstein.” written
and directed by Warhol‘s recently
surfaced protege Paul Morrissey.

Following closely on the heels of
its predecessor, “Dracula” is another

The DcFioris offer the Count any
one of their four virtuous daughle'rs.
There's just one little catch.
though—two of the girls have
already found their thrill with the
hired hand. a brute named Mario
(.Ioe Dallcsandro) whose studied
machismo. Brooklyn slang. and
Marxist leanings provide the film‘s
most readily accessible humor.

Obviously. Dracula samples the
two imperfect girls first (to com-
plicate matters) not realizing what
he's getting himselfinto. The result is
expected he can‘t keep down ex-
perienced blood. That still leaves
two virgins for the frustrated vam-

game and is doing his du mnedcsl to
disqualify the ﬁnalists.

Morrisscy has a somewhat
muddled message to deliver here!
he's using Dracula‘s plight as an
awkward metaphor for the collapse

Thcactingand dialogue iii the filth
are remarkably atrocious. There are
some very. very futtny lines that are
delivered with such contrived gravity
that laughter may seem an
afterthought. The gore is stylized to
the point of absurdity so the Ioppittg
off of an arm or leg is reduced to
slapstick. All of this is quite
intentionnlwa deliberate aim at
mediocrity.

The film’s only unplanned flaw is
that Morrisscy can't decide whether
he merely wants to point otll the
failingsofthc horror film or make us
laughl at them. too. But this is a
minor fault—«the film remains a
reasonably entertaining romp attd a

_ In the WM ytird freestyle
freshman Dave Rubin placed ﬁrst
with a new school record of “100.0.
This broke Len Van Ryn's old record
by a full seven seconds. Ken Weber
placed third in this event.

Rubin and Bridgewatcr‘s Bat-
tistini had an exciting dual for ﬁrst
place. Rubin managed to stay ahead
for the entire 40 laps of the race. But
around the 30 lap mark. Battistini
closed the gap and was a mere
shoulder length behind. Rubin seem-
ed to turn on an extra reserve of
energy and pulled away to ﬁnish the
race seven seconds ahead of But-
tistini.

Ben Siebccker swam next in the
200 yard f rccstylc and placed second.
Ben also came through in the ﬁnal
stretch to pull ahead in the last two
laps and beat the third place man by
half a body length.

Rick Masom swam a hard 50 yard
freestyle. with a time of 23.5. only to
miss ﬁrst place by .2 of a second.

In the 200 yard individual medley

Dave Rubin and Battistini once .

again competed closely for the se-
cond place. This time Battistini
managed to edge out Rubin by a
shoulder length. '

Artie Rosenberg placed ﬁrst in
both the one meter and three meter
diving events. The lack of divers has
in the past been a sore spot for
Albany swim teams. Rosenberg’s
success broke that tradition and con-
tributed to the moral and the point
total of the team. In the three meter
dive Rosenberg failed to complete
one of the ﬁve required dives. yet
managed to outdive Bridgewater in
the four remaining dives to compen-
sate for the failed dive.

In the 200 yard butterfly Mitch
Rubin cruised to an easy victory.
with the nutrest Bridgewater com-
petitor ﬁfteen seconds behind.

Ken Weber placed third in the loo
yard freestyle with a time of 52.4.

Rick Masom swam a strong race.
leading thcentire way to place ﬁrst in
the 200 yard backstroke. Dart
Dudley passed a Bridgewater
swimmer in the last two laps to take
third.

Dave Rubin once again placed
ﬁrst in the 500 yard freestyle. beating
challenger Battistini by a substantial

ll second margin. Ben Siebecker
placed third.

Albany swept the 200 yard

placing first and breaking his own
personal record with a time of2.28.4.

The grapplers participated in a

Women Drop Opener

Albany State‘s women's varsity
haskblbull team suffered a season
opening setback as they lost to Os—
wego State 7 l -34 Saturday at the vic-
tor‘s court.

Although the offense was unable
to penetrate well. a strong defense
enabled Albany to stay within strik-
ing range throughout the ﬁrst half.
After the half-time break. however.
Albany's defense faltered and 0s-
wego quickly pulled the game out of
reach with some surprisingly- nc-
curate hitting from the outside.

During the opening half. Albany
had difﬁculty stopping Oswcgo's
Jouunc Murphy. the game's leading
scorer with l7 points. Coach Bar-
bara Palm changer! Albany‘s defense
in an effort to get more height (in the
form ofVicki Girko) into the middle
to stop the towering Murphy. But
this left the defense prey to the
penetrating drives of ‘Vicki, Pope.
who had it fine second half to ﬁnish
the game with I4 points forOswego.

Coach Palm is considering some
new defensive changes to help her
team compensate for tits lack of
freight. One of these changes might
well be a 2-3 lone defense which she
hopes to try out this week in practice.

Coecaptuin Wendy Oath had a
litre game for Albany. providingthe
bulk of the scoring with l4 points.
She and Vita Uaviaprovided mostzof s.
the-hustle. but were unable to get the i"
offense moving.Davis"had 7 pointt‘

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

and Girko had 6.but more can beex-
pected from them once the offense
starts working effectively.

Probably a major factor in the loss
was the relative inexperience of
Albany's young team. composed of3
freshmen. 7 sophmores. and Ijunior
transfer student. As Albany had no
scrimmages. this was the ﬁrst time
these women have played together
against an opposing team. [tie in this
game situation that they must learnt
to adapt their style of play to the
foreign strategies of another team.
With the tough schedule they have (3
or 4 gamcsa week) allowingthem lit-
tle time for practice. most of the
problems will have to be ironed out
in actual game situations.

Coach Palm is stressing the im-
portance of driving to the hoop and
outpositioning the taller opponents
for rebounds. She is hopeful that the
team will be able to incorporate
more of these skills into it: plan for
this week's home games.

Albany will also have to work for
the better shot as they hit on only
23% of the shots from the lie“
Saturday. while Oswego hit «wot
their shots. Albany had the advert.
rage on the free throw line. however,
hitting nearly 33% of their foul shots
to 20% of the opponent's.
