Saturday‘s IDS-85 Albany victory
"over Southern Connecticut: In the
rentalning minutes of the contest it

v was the State substitutes that won‘

the applause of the crowd.

D‘oc' Sauers removed his starting
ﬁve with fourminutes remaining and
Albany ahead 9l-65. In the’course of
the action. 5' l0" Mel Brown had the
entire gym on their feet cheering his
acrobatics. The “Mel Brown Show"
featured three consecutive baskets in
a distinguished style.

Brown began his antics after being
charged with a palming violation at
midcourt. He stood up. silently ex-
ploded. and cautiously bounced the
ball to the referee. Then he took his
revenge.

The Owls‘ Ray White hit a lay-up
and the inbound pass came to
Brown. He dribbled a la Marques
Haynes complete with a series of
bounces while lying on his back. Mel
then took off downcourt. stopped at
the foul-line and swished a jumper
through the cords.

Following a missed shot by the
Owls. Brown got the ball. and again
he raced the length of the court (this
time with conservative dribbling
techniques). The University Gym
audience was electrified with the
driving shot. Mel capped off the se-
quence by stealing the ensuing in-
bound pass at mideourt. racing ,to
the basket and hitting the layup.

The late minute heroics by Brown
overshadowed the excellent in-
dividual performance by Ed John-
son. The sophomore guard shot an

incredible 12-13 and ﬁnished with 28'
points. Asa team. Albany amassed.
44 field goals. only four short of a

g recent contests. The Danes were fac-

ing a tough zone defense and were
forcing their shots from long range.
The much taller Connecticut squad
was moving on offense and ﬁnding
their forwards underneath for an
easy layup.

The Owls led l3-l2 with l3z3b
remaining in the first half when Doc
Suuers called time—out to change his
strategy.

Taller Owls

The taller Owl forwards were tak-
ing advantage of the Danes both
offensively and defensively. Sauers
decided to replace Gary Trevitt with.
Tom Morphis to hpr rebound.

Morphis was the key to this vic-
tory as he played flawless basketball
in the following four minutes. In this
period the Danes held the Owls
scoreless as they scored seventeen
points to attain a 2943 lead. The
Owls couldn‘t regain their style of
play as the rest ol‘thegamcappcarcd

Albany‘s largest lead in the contest
came in the second half with an 85—53
advantage.

favor of the man-to-man. defense.

frustration. They couldn't cope .with

Tom' Morphis was superb on
defense. blocking shots and grab-
bing rebounds. He and Pete Kooll
did everything possible to intimidate
the larger Owl forwards. On offense.
Morphis went 3-4 with 'seven points.
Koola had 5-8 for rw'e'i'v‘e’.’

The most important statistic was
the turnover ratio as Southern Con-
necticut muffed 27 to only l7 by
Albany. Most of the Dane turnovers
came in the final four minutes as the
substitutes played sloppily.

The Dane starters Bob Audi and
Mike Suprunowicz added excellent
performances. Audi was noticeable
as he hustled on defense. The corner-
man shot 5-7 for the evening with
twelve points. Suprunowicz was all
over the court. challenging the op-
ponents. He shot 7-l2 atid ﬁnished
next to high scorer Ed Johnson with
sixteen points.

Rich Kapner concluded the game
with twelve points and was a strong
point on defense. He grabbed loose
rebounds and acted as a floor leader
when GuryTrevittwas on the bench.

Although 'l'revitt did not score. he

played one of his finest games this .

season. He took only five shots but
he passed off to his teammates for
easy layup's as he controlled the ball.

Subs‘ Kevin Keane and Dave
Lanahan contributed four and six
points respectively. Their play was
steady and the extra game time wasa
welcome chance to prove their abili-

basketball squad saw their lead slip
to three points late in the second half

Pops had quite a scare in the second
half and were fortunate to emerge
with another victory.

Trude Baskets

The Colleginns scored first on a
Dave llullornn hoop before Steve
Puss found Verdcjo underneath for a
2-2 tie. Brown then hit a luyup and a
short jumper for a four point Dane
lead before both teams began
trading baskets. AllC went ahead 8-

Brown pumped another one in forn
one point advantage. The lead
changed hands six more times after

it looked like it would be quite a
dogfight. as the Pups lead by a slim

Staff, Library Cut In

by Daniel Gaines

Eighteen positions. including five
faculty. would be eliminated at
SUNYA if the Legislature passes
Govemor l-lugh Carey‘s proposed
budget. released yesterday.

SUNYA‘s proposed budget in-
crease of Sl.47b.t)l)l) represents
mostly mandated increases minus
about a lutlf—million dollars in cuts.
'l‘uition and llonrd increases seem
unlikely.

Reductions include: Faculty and
staf f t | 32.000). lower library acquisi.
tion rate 062.000). and the ex-
pected elimination of the Solar
Energy Project ($l92.tlt)0). a one-
yenr allocation. according to SASU.

Compared to other parts of the
State‘s budget. Carey‘s proposal for
SUNY is relatively generous.

SUNY Central announced last
spring that SUNYA would have a
Ito-growth budget. Cu rcy‘s budget is

consistant with that attitude.
providing for increases in faculty
and students at the other University
Centers but not SUNYA.

Vice-President for Management
and Planning. John Hartley. said he
was “very disappointed" but in-
dicated that thc allotments for
Albany were not unexpected.

One bright spot in thc proposed
budget is that it would give Albany
the lowest faculty-student ratio

Committee and Governor
May Ease Pot Penalties

by lidward Moscr

Campus heads may llll\'C some
pleasure in two current political
happenings. both of which have to
do with the possible elimination or
watering down of criminal penalties
for the use of marijuana.

First. the New York State
Assembly Committee on Codes
plans to hold open hearings to dis-
cuss the tough anti-drug laws passed
in [973 underthe guidnnccofformer
(iovernor Rockfeller. The Coin-
mittce is a sort of watchdog on
legislation; from time to time it
reviews the effectiveness of laws
erutctcd in the past.

Secondly. Governor Hugh Carey
said Wednesdayhc was considering
the casing of penalties for marijuana
usage.

Witnesses at the Codes Coin-
mittee hearings can be expected to
raise many questions as to the
R ockclcllcr lcgislution‘s effect on the
criminal justice system itself. 'l’akc.

for example. the plea bargaining
aspect of the present law. Those
brotlglit up on drug abuse charges
u re severely limited as to the extent
in which they and their lawyers can
bargain for more lenient sentences.
The result. some claim. has been that
:ullegcd abusers stay in court to the
bitter end of their trials. and thus
flood the court system with extra
cases. Many also object to the
emphasis on a single class ofcrimes:
they fear that the unusually heavy
penalties slapped on drug offenders
distort the justice system.

The drug law‘s influence on socie-
ty as a whole will also be studied.
Committee witnesses will try to find
out if harsher sentences deter drug-
related crimes. and it the enforce-
ment of the law has been effective
enough in increasing the number of
arrests of drug pushcrs during the
last year.

It would also be interesting to
know whether the number of drug

addicts isdecreasingund whether the
present law scares away those who
might provide information on illegal
narcotics deals.

In addition. there‘s little doubt
that some committee members
themselves will propose abolishing
penalties for the possession and use
of tnnrijuantt. The NY. Timur
reported Wednesday that Governor
llugh Carey was "considering the
rcmoval of criminal penalties for
possession ol'small amounts of mari-

Ijunna.“ The Governor scented to in-

dicate that two panels be had ap-

WSUA Forced Off the Air;
Equipment Breakdown Blamed

by “mid \‘l’inlclherg

lltc campus iutlio Slilllt)“ WSUA.
lclt the air last Friday due to
malfunctioning. equipment.

fire station has been broadcasting
with dated equipment needing frc~
quent rcpair for some time. Eric
Goldstcin. who has been with
WSUA fora year nnda ltalf(bccom-
ing Acting Station Manager just a
few days ago). said: “Our
transmitters are aged. it's difficult to
keep them on the air." (ioldstcin
feels that repairs will be made soon
and that the station will resume
broadcasting in “ten days to two
weeks".

The problems of the station stem
from the cost of the repairs needed
on each transmitter in order to
restore a good signal to all five
quads. l’at Mctilynn. (ioldstein‘r.
predecessor as Station Manager. ex-
plains that the transmitters are
“highly complex equip rnent" requir-
ing experienced engineers to repair
them properly; however. the cost of
hiring professional maintenance for

the equipment is prohibitive.
Mc(ilynn explained: “The cost for
getting the fivc transmitters working
\\llll a good signal would probably
exceed that station‘s present budget."

McCulynn. retired Station
Mnnngcras ofthis week believes that
the station could alleviate many of
its problems under a different
system. He favors the addition of “a
near full-time faculty advisor with
station experience or a professional
station manager" to help the existing
strident staff.

Although each year there is an
abundance of volunteers for WS UA,
a kind of apathy seems to have
developed among some of the
station‘s staff as well as its audience.
l he apathy is largely a result of the
station‘s failure so far to land their
clusch l-'M license. .locl Ifcld. the
station‘s Program Dircctot‘.bclieves
that “the chances are much im-
l‘tt'tHL't " to get the license. WSUA is
considering hiring Educational l‘M
Associates. a firm which aids radio
stations in getting their l: M licenses.

last year the sttntc firm helped the
station at Union College go FM.

Since leaving the air last week.
there have been questions raised
concerning the future of the station.
Student Association Vice-President
Irn Birnbaum said. “CcntralCouncil
should use careful consideration
before continuing the operation of
the station. It seems to me that many
people in this University don‘t care
about the station. one way or the
other." Some Central Council
proposals are to move WSUA off-
campus. operate the station on a
reduced budget or to form a com-
mittee to run it.

Sonic station workers claim there
has been administrative foot dragg-
ing in regard to the l" M license. They'
say that their FM application is
slow-moving because it has been tied
up in bureaucratic red tape. and
should be given the full attention it
deserves.

Nevertheless. current station
srntters are ntcetingthis week to all
the injured station back togethsr.
