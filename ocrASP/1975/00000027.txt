The furnishings hi the rec cettter as

damage. I ' '

The center will also include
numerous board games featuring
such notables as 'I’addle-Pong",
“Air Hockey", bingo, chess, and

and “Twister” games will also be
available, added Miss Frandina.

In addition to providing the IQ
residents with a place to relax and
unwind, Committee Chairperson
Shark said the center would “give
people a chance to meet new peo-
ple," which he feels is an important
part of the total University ex-
perience. He went on to say, “The
center is run by the IQ Recreation
Committee and by volunteers. But I

Asked if Henwsys would now be
unavailable for parties which it
hosted last year. Board President
Meyer said, “We probably will have
fewer large-scale parties there. but
since the equipment is movable, the
possibilities still, exist.”

The Recreation Committee wish-
ed ro thank all those people who
came down last Saturday to help
clean Henwsys up. Shark had par-
ticularly kind words for Miss Fran-
dina of whom he said, “Her extreme
enthusiasm and valuable assistance
in this endeavor made the whole
thing possible!”

The idea for a recreation area is
credited to Meyer, but the idea for
student useof Henwsys is not new.
Three years ago, the residents of “4-
plus-Z“ (Oneida and Onondaga)
came up with the notion of usingit us
a place where they could go to relax
instead of going off-campus. EVcn-

After heavy losses of approximately

JANUARY 31, 1975

Started in mo as Crisis 5300.;

Middle Earth is SUNY at Albany‘s
hotlinc (at people ‘with problems.
From its humble beginnings in a
closet of thc CampusCenter trying
to help students who were ex-
perimenting with drugs, Middle
Earth. funded by the New York
State Drug Abuse Control Commis-
sion, has grown intola vital part of
this University.

Middle Earth now has two ofﬁces

' on Dutch Quad. The switchboard

and walk-in centcrare housed in Ten
Eyck I07. Administrative ofﬁccsand
counseling rooms are in I02
Schuyler Hall.

When it ﬁrst began. Crisis 5300
co nccntratcd its efforts on answering
qucstions on drug use.'As people
become more knowledgeable about
drugs and as it grew Middle Earth
was able to divcrsify its services.
Middle Earth operators now deal
with relationship problems.
loneliness. suicide cases. and give in-
formation on pregnancy. They also
do pill identiﬁcation and many other
things.

The frequency and distribution of
calls varies but relationship.
problcmsare prevalent on weekends.
During the week there are more calls
from pcoplc'sccking information.

Middle Earth phones are
answered by undergraduate

rieno

voluntee rs. The M

operators are a diverse group of"

" about forty _students.}1";here is no
such thing as the‘typical volunteer.
They all. want to help their. fellow

students and all 'haVe certain,

qualities such as openness and the
ability to empathize with. others.
Applicants are screened by a com-.
mittcc and those chosen undergo a
' training program before they are
allowed to answer phones. The ﬁrst
stage of training is a weekend held at
the beginning of each semester. The
training is designed to bring up and
reﬁne those qualities which’the per-

son ttlready has and to build up their ‘

sclf-confidcncc. It also teaches
volunteers to ~ rccognizc those
problems that they cannot handle as
non-professionals and how to refer
these callers to others.

Now volunteers now learn the
ropes by sitting shifts with ex-
perienced operators. Even after they
become full operators volunteers at-
tcnd monthly clinics and are subject
to rc-cvaluation at any time. This is
done in order to insure that Middle
Earth is always doing the best
possible job.

Volunteers are also kept informed
of activities within Middle Earth by
an internal newsletter known as
"Zappcnings."

In addition to the switchboard

Middle Earth has counseling and

it...

someone with a

I , ‘components.v.r I ‘
The counseling component con
sists; ofhninctcen volunteer

counselors who are gruduateU ”

students in Clinical Psychology;

' Counseling. Social Work. and other

related fields. These 4 counselorst do
short term face-to-face counselingof '
people referred to them by the

‘ switchboard.

All counseling done by Middle
Earth is non-judgmental and all
decisions are left up to the caller. .
Barbara Hoffman. the director of
Middle Earth. stressed that thermal
important things about Middle
Earth are the speed at which things

.are done and the importance that is

placed on the individual student and
his problem.

Anything will be dropped to help
problem.
Counselors are available at all iimcs.
When a person is referred to u Mid-
dlc Earth counselor the initial con-
tact is made within twenty-four
hours.

When Middle Earth refers
someone to an outside agency or per-
son they will check to be certain that
the needed services are rendered
properly and promptly.

Beyond its function as a counsel-
ing center. Middle Earth is trying to
compile a "crush" list ofplaccs whcrc
pcoplc who are passing through can
stay for the night. '

Things that GOT‘Buzz _ g I
Throughout the Night,

by Judy Stelnberg

Suddenlt- amidst the murmur of
sleep. a harsh noise drills Ihrough Ihe
skull and prnclrules the brain. Its
ruggt'd edge, driving Ihrouglt a
dream, spins in expanding circle:
causing an explosion of onc's ﬂm-
Iasy. Abrupt/y awokr' , one realizes
it is 4 a.In.: Iha fire alarm is per-
.sislcntlt- buzzing. Anoilter/hlrcﬂre
alarm has been pulled. It's" been the
fourth one [his truck.

On-campus residents are often
forccd to leave the comfort of thcir
beds in response to thc whimsiculac-
tion ofu fcw prankstcrs. Each quad
is scheduled for two ﬁrc drills per
semester. usually occurring between
8:00 pm. and “:00 pm. False fire
alarms, bowcvcr. add greatly to this
number. .

Director of Security. James
Williams, noted an increase in the
occurrence of fttlsc olurnts itt I974.
Ninety fulsc fire alarms were
reported in I974 while in l9731hcrc
were 74.

I'Iott'cvcr iilt.‘ apprehension of
offenders is stilllimitcd. In l974only
three people were urrcstcd. ’l'wo
students were tried in (ittildcrland
I’olicc Court I‘orpttllingu false alarm
in Indian Quad on March i, I974.
Iiccottsc they were Illlthzl' 2| and Ititd
no prior rccord oi ilrl’Chl, their case
was "adjourned in conictttplation of
dismissal." This gave them six
months to cxltibit good behavior;
their record could then be wiped
clean.

, ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

The other apprehended student
had pulled an alarm in AlumniQuad
on September II. I974. Albany
police arrestcd him, the decision on
his case is still pending.

According to Lieutenant Ralph
Miller of the University Police, the
judicial system is ineffective in
dctcrring the incidence of false
alarms because of the limited
punitive quality of its decisions. To
curb the increasing number of false
atlannsDircctorWilliams suggests
application of peer pressure. liesaid
students should seek out the culprits
and cxhort them to refrain from
their serious jokc. '

The increase in false alarms has
ch Security ofﬁcials to consider
possible prcvcntitivc actions. At one
titnc Inst ycur in AlumniQuad.thcrc
were one or two false alarms daily.
Associate Director of Security. Karl
Schttrl, considered the possiblity of.
painting the pull boxes with a
fluorescent paint whcilt leaves a
dctcctuhlc powdcr on the hands of
the culprit. The hands of each resi-
dcnt would be checked under ultra-
vioch light as he rc-cntcrcd the
building after its evacuation and
subsequent scorch. This plan has not
bucn intplcmcntcd: Scltrtrl hopes it
will never be.

Witch a fire alarm is pullcd in the
uptown campus a signal is sent tothc
powcr plant. reporting the incidence
and location of a tire. I’owcr per- '
sonncl notify tltc University Police
who then dispatch a car to the ap-
propriate building. The entire
building is evacuated whilc security '
policc comb the rooms to locate a
possible fire. In event of a fire, the
Albttny Fire Department is sum-
moncd. If tht: the is located in Indian
Quad, doc to its location. the
McKnowuvillc Volunteer
Deportmcnt is also called. An
Albany Fire department station
sends about half its force uptown.
arriving in nearly four minutes.

The ﬁre alarms in the downtown
campus ring directly in an Albany
Fire Dept. sttttiou. ﬁre fighters race
to the designated building to deter- .
mine the existence of a ﬁre and if
necessary proceed with its ex.
tinguisltmenl.
