sixteen.'Rockefeller years. If‘ cuts havelto be made, and it appears they must. the

Administration must look within itself to trim the excess. The place for reductions is
not only in student services. and not only in ﬁring more qualiﬁed teachers through the
denial of tenure. The place for the reductions is not only through adding to class size or
increasing teachers’ class loads. The place to reduce the waste is also within the
Administration.

" Students alone cannot bear the load of an increase in board or room rates, no more
than the average homeowner could absorb the costs of higher property taxes. The
Governor understood this when he modiﬁed his ten cent gas tax hike. and SUNY
Central should be aware of this as well. A reduction in the quality ofhigher education is
not the sole answer to deal with the serious problems that the SUNY system faces
though it may be the most expedient, ,

It would be unfair and unwise for Central Administration to expect students and
faculty to shoulder the burden without a similar sacriﬁce on its part. A tuition. room or
board hike now would show poor judgment by SUNY’s leaders.

Not Our War

Like a recurring nightmare. the spectre of Vietnam has reared its ugly head in this
country again. Two years after America breathed a unanimous sigh of belated relief
with the signing of the Vietnam peace accord. President Ford has asked the Congress
for an appropriation totalling nearly a half a billion dollars in military aid to the
besetged- Theiu government. Almost as if history were repeating itself to the most
minute detail, the Ford request brings with it the promise that there will be no others

' that we will not be dragged into the conflict. but that we must aid our allies undert
_ attack from the Communist North.

There could be no more odious action taken than for Ford‘s request to be granted.
Slowly. like slipping in quicksand. the United States will ﬁnd itself in precisely the same
position we were in twenty years ago. when President Eisenhower started us on our
path to international disgrace.

We have already supplied the South with $150 billion in the most advanced military
death machines the Pentagon could devise. Saigon has what is reputed to be the fourth
largest air force in the world. By now. Americans should know only too well that the
South Vietnameseare simply incapable of fighting their own war. that initial American
aid will have to be followed by more and more aid. then with troops. then with
bombers. and we will be embroiled in a conflict that 200 million citizens said we would
never be involved with again.

How long can a foreign country prop up a military government when its own
military. the only citizens even remotely loyal to it. won't defend their own homes? It's a
cry heard too many times before: it is not thejob of the United States to bolster regimes
that make no pretense of being democratic. ’

We have supported Diem. the innumerable failures after him. Ky and ﬁnally Theiu.
The old cold warrior chants for “containment” will fall on deaf ears now. ears beaten
into numbness by the tragic deaths of 50.000 men in the rice paddies of Asia.

it's not our war anymore.

Bell Company Maintains
' Large Wire Tapping Force

 

WASHINGTON—Who can legally tap
your telephone without a court order? A.) the
F.B.l.. B.) your wife or husband. C.) the
telephone company. D.) the Pope. E.)
nobody.

Answer: C.) the telephone company.

Under a little-known provision of the
federal statutes. the Bell Telephone Co. can
tap your line. and they don‘t have to say boo
about it to anybody. The only condition: they
must suspect that you are perpetmting fraud
against Mu Bell. and that translates into using
electronic devices to make free phone calls.

But a Houston grand jury. investigating
charges that Bell employees helped local
police make illegal wiretaps. forced A’f&'l' to
reveal-that no fewer than 665 of Ma Bell's

themselves to answer to. and whose judgment
on whom to tap. when and for how long is
absolute and final.

Indeed. by the company‘s own reckoning.
this earphone armada costs far more to equip
and maintain than the total amount ilcll loses
in revenue from long distance clicuting. ill

year each. to be sure not an outrageous figure
for career veterans. Bell would be spending
more on security sulariesalonc than it is losing
from fraud. Not exactly a sound business
practice. especially in light of thc fitct that Mu
Bell. just like the rest of us. has the option oI
picking up the phone and calling the police
when she thinks someoncis stealinglrmnlicr

So what is this security army doing? it‘s at
question the Justice Department needs to ask.

Cmuifeta. in the meantime. should inch

As you ride on the Thruway from
New York to Albany. if you look to.
your right near exit 213. youwillsee,
a squat. but long building. it is as
brown and drab as the surrounding
fields.'A closer examination will
reveal bars on the windows and the
building‘s title chiseled over the en-
trance: Coxsackie State Vocational
Institution.

Early in September l entered this
edifice. more commonly referred to
as the Coxsackie Correctional
Facility. for the ﬁrst of my twelve
visits as a tutor. Two other tutors
and myself were met by the short. cx-
uberant man who had convinced us
to work at Coxsackie. .Ierry Ducie is
the head of Volunteer Services.ajob
which is understandably difﬁcult.
thn he told us that only four
remained of the almost one dozen
students who had signed up totutor.
l was thinkingabout making it three.

Fifth Grade Leveh

Walking through the halls. it
didn‘t take an exceptionally obser-
vant person to realize that the inmate
population was predominantly
black (approximate ﬁgures are 70%
black. 20% white. l0% Puerto
Rican). To make matters worse. l
was informed that the journalism
course I intended to teach would not
be possible. l'd be working in the
Learning Lub with inmates who per-
form under a fifth grade level iii
reading and math. Why hadn‘t i
signed up to bc a big brother at the
LaSulle Academy for Boys instead?

The Lcuming Lab utilizes cassette
tapes and slide projectors to teach.
My function was to interrupt an in-
mate and try to aid him in the lear-
ning process. Fortunately the in-
matcs iii Coxsackie range in age
from |6~A21 so lwouldn‘t be dealing

59

with men embittered by years of
frustration.
Remember Violatee

My initial efforts to teach were far
from successful but at least [wasn't
ignored or outwardly resented.
What is most memorable about that
day is a conVersation i had with a
prisoner who acted as an aide to the
teacher in charge of the lab. Speak-
ing to him was easier than com-
municating with the other inmates in
the room. since he had a complete
high school education and was
currently taking college courses.

Violence is the word to remember.
he told me when l questioned him
about prison life. The biggest and
st rongcst are usually at the top in the
hierarchy of the inmate population.
if you are intelligent you can be in
the upper class as well. He con-
sidered himself at the top since
nobody was going to get anything
over on him. He believedvthe only
friend he had was himself. By un-
derstanding this and acting accor-
dingly. you may get by in prison.

Coxsackie has a little over 600 in-
mates so sooner or later you‘ll have
eaten with. played with. spoken to
and showered with most of the pop-
ulation. Since these young men may
not touch a woman for years.
homosexual sex does manifest itself.
in the course of my conversation I
was told that if you don‘t watch out
for the next guy you might end up
sleeping with him. Mr. Ducic insists
this cannot be true. lalso doubt the
validity ofthe inmate‘s assertion but
on ensuing weeks i heard of
prisoners making wine and ac-
quiring marijuana. so the single cell
system may not be foolproof.

lly my second week at Coxsackie I
realized that some inmates actually
wanted to speak with me. They

 

spoke freely about almrut anything.

A muscular inmate from Brooklyn
and i spent a while discussing parts
of our home borough. This guy
would be my “homy' if I were a
fellow prisoner. “Homies.” or in-

mates from the same city or town are '

usually friends. He had plenty of
homies since most of Coxsackie‘s
population is from New York City.
However. friends in prison are never
very close.

i told him that I used to take the 

LL train to work in Maspeth.which
is on the Brooklyn-Queens border
near where he lived. The LL train
was-the reason why he was in prison.
He held up a token booth at an LL
station. His accomplice. a younger
male. was apprehended and con-
vinced to implicate him. This story
was told with no signs of ,bittemess.
Great pride was taken in the fact that
he was never caught in the act. He
has resolved never to use an ac-
complice again.
Baby-Sitting Operation

By my third week of tutoring. i
had had enough of tapping inmates
on the shoulder and yelling at their
headphoncd visages. "Do you need
any help?“ i talked the Director of
Educational Facilities into letting
me assist an English teacher who
taught High School Equivalency
and Regents classes. Through him
and through my own observations it
became clear to me that Coxsackie
was a big baby‘sitting operation. it‘s
a numbers game.whcrc as longas in-
matesare not in their cells butarc ac-
counted for. everything is all right.
Most inmates don‘t care to learn. so
the teachers have to spend most of
their time keeping them in line. At a
prison things are very different from
a regular school since a prisoner
doesn't care about threats meant to

.x.

instill discipline. ,
From the fourth week on. lfeltas
comfortable as i could feel in a

prison. I felt as if lhsd been totally:

autmilisted into the situation when l

, was busy. As soon as I hsdarnornent

to think about where I was. lbecsme

a bit self-conscious. as if i was an in- "

truder. Meanwhile. my ability to get
ideas across to inmates was ini-
proving. Even though i was an
English tutor. sometimes I was asked
to teach math. After spending an
hour helping one guy add two-digit
numbers I was left with a‘ feeling of
satisfaction. It didn‘t matter that he
had blamed me for all his

- mathematical errors: he was able to

do some addition when he left me.
No More Aecompllees

After it became evident to me that
i wasn‘t going to teach much. con-
versations with inmates became im-
portant. The fact that I was a
volunteer was known to them and it
made it difference in the way they
reacted towards me. Inmates that I
saw every week said that they looked
forward to my visits. Having them
say it was good rapping with me was
a hell of a lot more rewarding than
showing them where to place com-
mas in a sentence.

A friendship was begun in the
Learning Lab when I helped an in-
mate. who was once a resident of
Troy. ﬁgure out coordinates on a
line. Later on i discovered he had
been takinga test. We both moved to
High School Equivalency classes at
about the same time. Each week our
discussions became more personal.
First he spoke about the poorly
planned robbery which he didn‘t get
away with. Hs was paroled. ac-
quiring ajob and a girlfriend while
back in Troy. A second robbery with
an identical result followed. Very

him that he was having I '

tolerating prison life so'>I 
this was a false hope he hadforesd
himsele to -‘ believe. While he
demonstrated a true talent for im-,
personations and an honest belief

‘ that a show business career is possi

ble for him. he didn't try to create a; ;
direction in life for himself and allow
himself to act out his life in an un- ‘
thinking. instinctual manner. This
genuinely friendly young man will
probably compile a long poiee
record interspersed with larceny
convictions since hejust goes back to
his old ways without trying to effect

a change.

This man is not unlike many con-*-
victs in that he returned to unlawful
activities upon being released from
prison. The return rate for parolees
is over 60% and this figure does not
include parolees arrested in another
state.

Can't Hack Prkon

Although i had a number of ex-
periences at Coxsackie which will
always evoke a good feeling when I
think of them.my overallimpression
is dampened by the fact that these
men are no older than lam and some
are no more of a criminal than you
and your fellow students. i thought
of this on my last day there. feeling
that l was leaving friends behind
who needed to speak to me. And
then as the last class ended. the little
guy who often bugged out. either
ranting and raving or going into a
trance. fell out and couldn‘t be rous-
ed. He was barely aware ofanything
as he was carried out by two guards.
He's still tlicrc.and‘so are the rest of
them who can‘t hack prison. but the
rehabilitation process goes on.
