reopens the bidding and with his
partner‘s encouragement end up in a
fine game contract. Now for the
goodies! West's opening lead is the
Queen of diamonds which is taken
by South'sKing. The Ace of hearts is
cashed. all following. Now is as
good it time as any to play spades. so
let's do so. West follows smoothly
and calmly when South playstt small
spade. What do you do?

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Jack loses to the Spade Queen we
cannot be entirely ccrtaiti its to the
location of the lien rt Queen. The last
case when (4) the play of the Jack
Iorces the Ace, teti tricks obviously
conic rolling in. So we see that the
play of the King always either wins
or givesa lteipfulelue as to the subse-
quent play. The Jack. however.
althouin may sometimes turn'oiit
well. is actually an inferior line.
