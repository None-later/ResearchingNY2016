v" For years and’years‘. Native People have sat I
,and listened to speeches by non-Indians that

gave wonderful accounts of how good the

~ country is now that it is developed. We have

listened to people tell us that we must forget
everything Nati‘Ve, as it is impossible for
’indians’to maintain their way of . life in a
modern civilized world.

responsibility.

The ultimate irony is that the white man
must drop his money-hungry civiliration and
return to a tribal-type society if he is to
survive.

1 “tom Where'th‘ey all came._ ,

On an environmental level weare faced with
such a'good .iit'eright" now, and although the
consequences of continuing our extravagant
ways are becoming apparent. we are. and with
good reason. horriﬁed by those modern day
Jeremiahs forecasting our demise and begging
(or demandingdependingon their styles) for a
"Return to Nature“ movement. In many cases
the “Return to Nature“ conce tion has
become synonomous with therehvironment
movement. For instance. in advertising the.
two are misused as one to sell everything from ,
granola (". . .the natural way to start the
morning“)to petroleum i“. . .after all. nature is
what Exx'on's all about“).

uddllng Ideas

The fact that many here at the univeristy
seem‘ to have muddled two basically different
ideas is disturbing. They are different in that
the environmental movement must be
feasibly. practically and scientiﬁcally
oriented. whereas the “Return to Nature"
clique seems to have turned to a nostalgic,
naive. and in some ways mystical approach to
the ecological problems we face. That many
respected and well meaning persons have
diverted their energies to the, latter is harmful:

Assuming. as I do not, that wecould enact a
I80", turn back to nature, how happy would
webe after the novelty of it allhad worn thin?
Undoubtably. we would lind:how"ma'ny of

those terribly “unnatural” sins't've had held as

sybarites’.‘ can not be'done without_—,—for even
agriculture is unnatural. Fromithe moment
our neanderthaiic forefathers found that the

» leftover grain from the wintercouldbe planted

where he wanted it, he had committed that
ﬁrst sin of “unnaturality.”

He was now, in effect, trying to steer his own
course: taking his fate into his own hands.
(“The fault. dear Brutus, is not in our stars but
in ourselves.’.') And deep down our simian
precursor knew there was something
extraordinary about the concept of adding a
rudder to his ship‘in time, because coinciding

'with this so unnatural a step came the birth of

religion. and a god to keep his hip afloat as
gramps made a bee-line for MacDonald‘s-
iand. Indeed. we would find Mother Nature
suckling us with sour milk and the bee. still
hoarding his honey. . I

Alas. returning to paradise is not the
answer. I believe the environmentalists‘ course
to be the same juggling act as any profession.
He must work toward ecological stability but
in so doing he must look ahead, not behind—
to a past which is tempting solely because he
know. it not.
