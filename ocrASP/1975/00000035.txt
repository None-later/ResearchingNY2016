went on to shoot 9 for l4 from the
ﬁeld. and 4 for 5 from the line.

Albany‘s varsity head coach Doc-

tor Richard Sauers praised the 6’l"
guard: “Ed is a much improved
ballplayer since last year. He has
better body control, is more dis~
ciplined. and presents every oppo-
nent with a serious 20-point scoring
threat.“ , .

Sauers also cited the play of

Suprunowicz. who has been averag-

ing over 16 points per game. as well

as that of Koola. who reached a

career high l8. _

However. Sauers was not satisfied
with the Danes‘ defense. "Utica was
beating consistently inside." said
Sauers. “and you cannot allow that
type of weakness to remain. It is par-
tially a discipline problem. as well as
a matter of finding the right com-
binations. I thought we were on the
right track after the win over S.C.
itos~sst but..." '

The Dancs‘ original game plan
called for a fast-movinggamc.a run-
ning offense balanced by a pressing
defense. in hopes of taking advan-
tage of the all freshmen Pioneers'
lack of experience. The plan did not
work. as Utica opened'up a 4-0 lead.
and stayed right with the Danes for

most of the game. thanks to the
shooting of Calvin Wilson (22
points). Gordon Taylor ( I 8). and Bill
Alibrandi (l6). .
' “I watched Utica play in the .
Fredonia Tournament a couple of
weeks ago,“ said Sauers. “and
Wilson and Taylor did not impress
me. As for Alibrandi. well. hedid not
even play in that one.“ (Further in-
vestigation revealed that Alibrandi
had joined the team just priortothat
Tournament.)

With 6:17 left in the first half. and
Albany leading 32-24. the two teams
embarked upon a six tninute basket
swapping contest. before Audi and
Gary Trevett (9 points) hit con-
secutive baskets to give the Danes a
48-38 halftime lead.

The Danes shot 24/32 (57%) and

.Faculty-Student Association
manager E. Norbert Zahm may ask
the Board of Directors-for a board

increase for next year because of

soaring food prices.

“Expenses are going up and up
and up all thetime. and it‘s knocking
the hell out of us.“ said Zahm. “I per-
sonally don‘t think we can make it
another year at this rate.“headded.

Last year FSA had a tiet income of
$345000. this year our income will
be about 559.000 Zahm explained.
“We can‘t be a six million dollar
business and only make 550.000—
that‘s much too much tieartitc line.“

Student Association Vice-
President lru llrinbaum said
ltowever. “We‘re still tnakiitg money
on food wnow all we ltave to do is to
eliminate things that lose money."
liirnbaum is one of the six student
members on FSA‘s twelve-man
Board of Directors. liirnbnum is op-
possed to a board hike.

Howie (irossnm. another stttdent
member on the Board is tnore sym-
pathetic to an increase. “FSA has to
be financially healthy. lfit turns out
their costs have gone up and they‘re
going into the red thcit there should
be a board hike." he said.

“The cost of food isbiting into our
net income.“ said Zahm. For exam-
ple. sugar is up 32l% over last year.
the FSA general manager explained.
"Last year a hundred pound bagcost
twelve do liars. this year it costs ﬁfty-
l'our dollars. We use one hundred
hundred-pound bags a month.“

Compared to last year. jello is up
2l2%. coke syrup is up 121%. and
spaghetti is up l30% said Zahm. The
price of some meats held reasonably
even with the prices of last year. lte

' .lnotcd. However. that‘s “still high.“

Another major increase that
necessitates a board ltike is the ten-
ccnt tttinimum wage boost. Zahm
explained. “We must pay $40,000
more a year just to pay for student
help. he noted.

"FSA should have a minimal
amount of tttoney in reserve.“
(irossman explained. “There were a
lot of mistakes in the past and we
must bear the burden."

"It's in otir interests to have a
strong FSA.“ Grossman noted. “On

the other hand." Birnbaum
countered. “we don‘t want FSA to
take advantage of the inflationary
period to build up." However.
Grossman remarked that "you need
a surplus to run a six million dollar
business so that you don‘t have to go
to the banksif, for example. a cooker
breaks down."

'“FSA is financially sound." said
Zahm. “We're healthy. We still have
things to pay off—we‘ll be totally
healthy when we pay off all our
loans.“ he added.

“The one big outstanding loan is
“80.000 front Student Associa-
tion." lie noted. Zaltm' added that
there is “a lot of pressure to keep
prices and net income down. which
would take us longer to pay offour
loans."

dations will be followed by the non—

Some 2M Party Cheeks i '-‘_ 
Banned From" FSA Cashing ‘  _;

by Daniel Gaines

Starting February fourth. FSA‘s
Check Cashing operation will no
longer accept second pttrty personal
checks, i.e.. personal checks made
out by someone other than the per-
son cashing the check.

Also on thatdntc l’SA will begin

charging teit dollars per check that "
’J'iills in the “Accoutit Closed“. "No

Account.“ or "Stop Payment"
categories. Anyone found guilty
after referral to the Student Judicial
Cotirt will lose cheek-cashing
privileges until December list of the
following year.

The new policies. adopted by the
FSA Board of Directors at their
meetittg last Wednesday. are iit

response to the increasing nttmber of '

bad clteeks being passed to FSA.
The number of bad checks iit
. December. I974 was itp twenty—six
pcrcetit eyer December. I973. The
dolliir amount was up |9%.
‘Students receiving checks from
home will be especially in-
convenienced by the new policies;
they will ltave to get their own ac-
counts or ltavc their parents send
certified checks or money orders. “i
don‘t like the stringent measures
anymore titan itnyone else." said

FSA Director Norbert Zahm. “but a
sircable minority have chosen to rip-
off cheek-cashing.“

Only personal second party
checks are involved. so bank; FSA.
State. Company. SA and other sev
cond party checks will still be
honored.

Cases will be referred to the Stu- .
detit Judicial Court for review and
possible transmittal to the ap-
propriate police agency. which will
usually be the Albany District At;
to rncy‘s office.

Comparable procedures are being
designed which will apply to faculty
and staff.

Check Cashing has traditionally
been one of the "losers" of the FSA
operations. having lost $0.000 last‘
year. Every category of bad checks
ltas increased in number; Accounts
Closed went up 33|% from
December. I972 to December. I974.

Zahm has suggested to the FSA
Board of Directors (there are six
students on the Board) that the fee be
raised from f iftecn cents per check to
twenty-ﬁve. Thiswould not solve the
theft problem. but would put the
troublesome operation in the black.
The additional ten cents would have
meant more than “5.000 last year.

 

 

More Course Concentration Found j

by Deborah C. Sharp

Because of the elimination of
specific course requirements.
SUNYA students majoring in the
Social “ ' and l' ' ‘
ltuve chosen to take more courses in
their major and related fields accor-
ding to a reportcompleted by the Of-
ﬁce of Undergraduate Studies.

increased specialization leads to
the dilemma of deﬁning a liberally
educated person. who istrnditionai-
ly thought of as being well-rounded
with background in ii wide range of
study.

The report is a study of aeadetnic
credit earned by the SUNYA
graduates of May l974.und includes
855 students who’begim as freshmen
here in Sept. 1970, the year speciﬁc
course requirements to fulfill a
“minimum liberal arts" requirement
were eliminated by the University
Senate. .

“it is'the first evidence we have on

the behavior of students with almost

complete freedom in the selection of
courses." stated Robert Morris.
dean of Academic Affairs.

The study reveals a severe lack of
courses taken in the Natural
Sciences and Math areas for
students in'the Humanities and'
Social Sciences. Students with a ma-

jor in the Social Sciences took only
tow courses in the Math/Selene:
area (on the average). However. the
majority of this Math/Science work
was -- ,‘ ‘ " by Economics and
Psychology majors who took fouror
ﬁve courses per person. as compared
to Poll Sci and History majors who
averaged one course and one-half
course per person. respectively.
Humanities majors took one
Math/Science course per person (on
the average).

ltt eontrttst. the greatest spreitd in
course distribution of study
appeared among majors ill the
Natural Sciences and Mathematics.

The report also noted what it
termed a “disproportionate amount
of credit" earned in the major
department. Music majors com-
pleted 59% of their work within their
ntajor. Art majors 42%. Afro~
American studies majors 4l%. and
Nursing majors 43%. This compares
with astronomy and Poli Sci ntajors.
who completed l8% and 28%.
respectively.

Prior to fitll 1970. students had to
take certain courses to fulﬁll the
“minimum liberal arts“ requiretnent
for either a BA or BS degree. The
purpose of speciﬁc requirements
were. explained Dean Morris. to in-

lmw SUNYA

sure a “distribution of knowledge
over the three major areas of man's
knowledge: the Humanities. Social
Sciences. Natural Sciences and
Mathematics." Among those
courses previously required were 12 _
credits in the Natural Science/ Math
area.

Although the report states
“limited adjustments by
departments appear to be called
for.“ Dean Morris stated that the
report contains “no specific
rceotnmendations of what changes
need to take place." but points out
speciﬁc matters that in his judge-
inetit call for “careful attention by
the faculty.“ He expressed hope fora
cooperative effort. nitd use of the
“collective wisdom of student. facul-
ty. and the available information on
.issues as brand as: What this campus
means by n liberally educated per-
son.“

A full copy of the report has beat ‘
forwarded to the Undergraduate ' 4‘
Academic Council. which establish
ed degree requirements. In addition
the council received hismemo Midi“
