ln theki'n'idst of the budget crunch, organized athletics is taking it ﬁrmly on the chin.

In San Fl‘fnclscoi-the city’s board of education has abandoned intramural and in-
terscholastic sports in an effort to achieve a precarious balance of its funds. As is ap-
parent from the outburst following that decision, it is not a popular one. Mayor Alioto
has ‘promued to find the funds toreiiistate the athletic programs. while high school
students thretiten a general boycott of classes if the funds are not found.

The situation withirespect to intercollegiate athletics in New York State is complex
and Albany State reflects that complexity in its own’con'fusing style. While Central
Council defeated a proposalthat would effectively reduce'funding to the enormous

pantie, by at "
—Rob'eri' MK intruder.

Athletic Advisory Board. tthe group which officially controls varsity sports on thie .

campus), a SASU resolution has called on all SUNY campuses to reduce its level of
funding to varsity t‘ports, and to withdraw from the NCAA until that national
organization permits SUNY to put its athletics under student control. Presently,
NCAA mics require that the University control athletics, while student tax pays the
overwhelming share of varsity sports funds.‘ r

The AAB has gone unquestioned for years, and the attempt by Council members like
Dave Coyne to put the AAB under wary student scrutiny is long overdue. The vitality
of varsity sports to a university community, especially to one as large as Albany's
however. is yet more important than the need to bring the giant under some sort of
restriction. Certainly the SASU answer to cutback or drop out of the NCAA solves
nothing. A pull-out removes all the remaining options which SUNY might have. and
thus we lose all force in bargaining for our goal. Cutting back on athletics merely skins
the issue and delays an inevitable conﬂict between those who feel the university is solely
for academics and those who associate sports with emotions such as school spirit and
self motivation. '

Organized athletics, both on the intramural and intercollegiate levels, are far too
important to the smooth running of a college campus to allow it to suffer an ill-
conceived plan to return it to the control of the students who pay for it.

Playing With Numbers

Faculty-Student Association is a multi-million dollar corporation and as such is a
bit complicated for a group of students, professors, and administrators to analyze. Yet.
this is exactly what such a group, the FSA Board of Directors. is going to have to do.
FSA Director E. Norbert Zahm is in the unique position of being the only person to
have the training and capacity to understanda six million dollar corporation budget.

Of course there are auditors. and the Directors are not a bunch of bumbling idiots.
But the point is that theyimay not know the right questions to ask Zahm. and no matter
how well-meaning Zahm is he can‘t think of everything. ’

Everyone knows that food prices are up. and it does indeed seem reasonable that
FSA could be in trouble because ofthem. How much ofa Board increase should there
be? Sugar has gone up 32l% in the past year but we assume Zahm won‘t suggest
students pay $1000 a semester for a full board plan. Some foods prices go down. but a
decrease in board rates appears unthinkable.

We suggest that we make as much money as possible from the other operations of
FSA. and keep the board rise to a minimum. We‘ve heard figures as high as ten percent.
and we know that‘s much too high. The Board of Directors would be missing the point
of our University: higher public education that is accessible to all income brackets.

Errata

It was incorrectly reported in last Tuesday's edition that the new FSA check cashing policy
would ban payroll checks from the items negotiable at the window. The new policy willonly ban
second party personal checks, not state. FSA, or company payroll checks. In addition, the
policy begins on February fourteenth. rather than on the fourth as was originally reported.

Behavior Modification Flourishes

WASH lNGTON—Those who saw Stanley
Kubrick‘s Clockwork Orange will not soon
forget the climactic scene of that brilliant,
violent movie portrayal of the future.

The "hero." gang leader and repeated rapist.
has had his behavior modiﬁed by a new
government program. He is led on stage in
front of leading government officials—they
want to see how well their money has been
spent. Then it young girl comes out and
removes her clothes. He rushes to her. his
thoughts obvious. But then the behavior
modiﬁcation takes over. His face contorts
with pain and nausea. his body portrays
extreme agony. The attack stops. the girl
leaves, and the “hero” returns to his normal.
healthy. happy self.

Was this merely a far-out. ﬁctional account
of how some l984 society may solve its crime
problems? Perhaps.

, But in lowa. under it study financed by the

federal government. the drug apormorphine
has been used as punishment for prisoners
guilty of minor offenses such as smoking.
Apormorphine causes uncontrollable
vomiting.

ln Califomiii. state mental hospitals have
discouraged assaults and suicide by using
ancetine. a drug which causes respiratory
seizure and muscular paralysis. Anectine is
derived from curare. the South American
arrow-tip poison. Dr. Arthur Nugent.
administrator of an ttnectine program,
describes its effects as “sensations of
suffocation and drowning as though on the
brink of death." Dr. Nugent recently told a
San Francisco Chronicle interviewer, “I
wouldn't have one treatment myself for the
world...(hut) I'm at it loss as to why
everybody's upset over this."

In use throughout our nation's state and
federal prisons is the drug proxlixin. ER.
Squibb, manufacturer of proxllxin. lists its
possible side effects as “nausea. loss of
appetite. headache, constipation, blurred

vision. glaucoma. bladder paralysi..

impotency. liver damage. hypertension sevct L'
enough to cause fatal cardiac arrest. and
cerebral edema."

These and hundreds of other govcrtimcutr
inspired behavior modification programs
have come to light with the recent publication
of a three-year study by the Senate .llldlcliil)
Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights.

in the preface, Subcommittee Chairman
Sen. Sam .l. Ervin. Jr. (D-N.C.) warns “thch
is a real question whether the government
should be involved at all in programs lltttl
potentially pose substantial threats to our
basic freedoms...The question becomes more
acute when these programs are conducted. as
they are today. in the absence of sittrt
controls.“

The programs to which Ervin refers tire not
limited to the Clockwork Orange varicti
Many provoke images of Nazi Germany and
Aldous Huxley‘s Brave‘New World, An lll- W
program for treatment of youthful thug
offenders prompted a high school guidance
counselor to report that participants “seem to
be living in n robot-like atmosphere. they
won‘t speak to anyoneoutside of their own
group... (and they) seem to have it" informing
system...they run in to use the telephone daily.
to report against each other..."

Senator Ervin‘s report makes no specitic
recommendations. it has been forwarded to
the National Commission for the Protection
of Human Subjects of Biomedical and
Behavioral Experimentation. The
Commission has authority merely to "study"

abuses of subjects‘ constitutional rights.
Neither it nor Congress apparently plans tltly
action in the foreseeable future. Thus. thcrc
seems little likelihood of it change in Ervin's
assessment that “...the federal government...is
suing ahead with behavior modification
Projects. including psychosurgcry. without it
review structure fully adequate to protect the
constitutional rights of the subjects..."

the“ rustic charm
of vermont skiing

by Lu Shapiro

Wailsfield is a small ski village located in
Vermont. nestled in avast snow bowl within it
ten mile radius of three skiing areas:
Sugarbush. Mad River Glen. and Glen Elen.
From the endless branching Waitsficld roads.
one can catch a glimpse of the skiing terrain
which is sheltered by the overflowing forest.
Stiittll shoppiiigttrcas. restaurants. lodges. and
pubs. as well as a host of night entertainment
contribute ltl the superbly comfortable rustic
atmosphere. The cabin which my grotip of
friends and I occupied provided everything
imaginable for our convenience. that is. when
certain members ol' the grotip could find their
way back.

A group ol thirteen struck ottt iii four
separate curs fol the hills of Vermont. in early
January. \vhct'c picturesque mixes of forest
and strctuiis and acres ol downhill skiing l'illl

spine-tingling. lot we were all titiitcunxious to
hit the slopes. liticli group was given a map
upon departure from the Albany tlrcil. which

relieved us of ours after having traversed the
same low roads along the Vermont hills it half
do/eii limcs. for the turns indicated on the
map were directing us to the wrong side of the
road. A Mr. Fine was responsible partially for
the directions. yct ttpon our arrival at the
cabin. we found that he had already been
dismembered by other group travellers.

We were most honored dtiriiig this snow
vacation to have in our midst. tt personage of
infamous stature. it Duke. The Duke‘s real
was unusqu in that he constantly fell asleep iii
the car and never failed to give the wrong
directions. U poii awakening one time frotn aii
hour snoo/c and having been asked which way
tltc driver should titrn. he tiustcrely replied.
“Left.” Of course. the party was to become
hopelessly lost. Also among the entourage of
skiers were three rotiglt speaking. “osfidious”
characters. known as lhc Dakotas. who
enjoyed a hearty game of blood poker. and
were moved to moments of tituidity at the
telling of bedtime stories. The majority of the
people in the group were beginning skiers.

ycttrs of experience.

arrival. it buddy and I went fora brisk walk

posing an isolated charm. lwas still reflecting
upon the crystal clear sky of the night before
while we were loading our gear the next
morning. in the hope of reaching Glen Elett
early enough to enjoy it full day of skiing.

Upon our arrival at the ski area. the
beginners“ ltill became a plethora of virgins on
the slopes. All beginning skiers have the
inborn fear offttlliiig down the ski slopes.so it
is natural for them to lean in toward the
mountain. This movement places the skicr‘s
weight on the tipliill ski. enabling the-skier to
maintain a line across the hill without
sidcslipping doivn the slope. This is a fairly
comfortable approach. btit it becomes it little
tricky when it comes time to navigate it turn
without cruising on oitc's face. it is necessary
to use the uphill ski to hold the Iiiicits tltcskicr
is going into the turn. for he or she must
prepare to push off with the downhill ski iti
order to start the weight transfer and edge
change which is it necessity for each turn.
Therefore. the weight is always transferred on
the downhill ski when tingling into it turn. for

acceleration and direction.

I was in the habit of coming down slopes
straight. without making many turns and
gaining an iticrcdihletttnount ol speed, lspcnt
most of my time perfecting turns on the novice
slope. for this is not only a dangerous habit:
(the skier does not have at great amount of
control over himself). it is also quite it sloppy
practice. So this was the 'on to develop ti
little skill. The warm-up exercises which I had
doiie for the previous months. which ranged
from sit-ups. stretching movements. and
bending. served to develop my ﬂexibility and
loosened my muscles. This is beneficial for
another reason. for it can lessen the severity of
an injury if onc does occur.

Snow cuts are those monster pieces of
machincry that all skiers must coiitctid with.
though beginners have the most difficulty
getting out of its plodding path. These cats
groom the slopes after snow has fallen or
artificial snow has been made. Moguls. by the
way. are bumps iii the snow caused by skiers
turning in the same place. Jean-Claude told
me that these bumps are also tnade front old
skiers who were plowed over by the giant snow
rcdeemer. the snow cat.

'I he poet Robcn Frost once said. “Some say
the earth will end in firetsome say in ice.....“
After skiing at Glen Elen. i feel that the latter
will probably be true. for the landscape was
etched by flowing ice in certain places.
sometimes encouraging onc‘s skis to work
independently of the skier. But snow or ice. i
felt myselfgliding across a wondrous glittering
space. The only sound I heard was that of my
skis and poles.

At the end of an exhilarating day of
propelling ourselves down the slopes and
turning our skis iii the valleys between'thc
moguls, tittcmpting to maintain its track while
carving in the bumps. we rcturned to the

ensuch was not only a game of the ancient
"twister." which was complicated when the
spinncr made the additions of various areas of
the body. but also a word game utilizing the
Words: ZOOM . SCHWARTZ. Fl(il.lANO
and SPLIV lCl'l. the hitterbcing accompanied
by a raised elbow when a player said the wrong
responding word. I remember tlitit it was
impossible to "zoom" :1 “schwurtz.” but that a
"room" could follow iii most discs. Then came
the big poker game. Jean-Claude supplied the
chips while one tilthe Dakotas. Wets. shuffled
the cards and dealt ‘em around the table. Each
player maintained his own. but as the hours
passed on. there was ii detectable intense
attempt on the part of each player to lead the
hands. Due to the analytical subtlety ofa few
players during the course of the evening. men
steadily sifted from the game. intermittently
the Duke improvised with raw jokes and
perverted beliaviorisms. He was soon to be
one of the final two players in the big game.
which he brought ton conclusion by quipping,
“Let's quit. cause we‘lljust be taking from each
other. and i want to go to sleep." Thus. the
Duke came out ahead with over six bills. and
Jean-Claude with at least two. piltherating
with a head embossed with scotch. During
other moments. we played card games. ping-
pong. manual field hockey. battleships. its well
as it great deal of pocket pool.

Jciin-Cliiudc was worth his twelve years of
experience. I watched him as he took off and
absorbed the irregular terriiin by allowing his
body to compress on the crest or top of a
butitp. Then. he would extend his legs through
the full line to curve a turn with good ski-snow
coiitiict. A less expert skier. such as myself.
might practice these extension turns the first
few tinieswith different results. At first. loften

a woodland gladc of spruce and ntirrow
winding trails. Afterwards. I found that
whenever I was going too fast. I coinmundcd
my skis to effectuate ti series of turns.

Three days later we left the hills of Vermont.
Twelve of us retunied to Albany. where the
Duke took tip soineone‘s suggestion and set
otit for Troy to open up a charm school for
perverts. I had experienced a strange aching
silence when the cabin was empty. for the
spool of a few exciting wintry days stretching
endlessly ahead. had wound up its ribbon and
suddenly disappeared.

My skiing had deﬁnitely improved. and on
the trip back. I imagined that lwas still on the
slopes. There isa lonelincssthat keens through
one‘s mind. for when you are standing along
the pine bordered slopes or upon the stranded
summit of a hill. you can experience the
powerfulness of the environmental beauty
around you. and you can kindle a reaching
beyond the limits of experience. You learn to
respond to the shock of high speed mogul
skiing. as you become a soaring thrust of
freedom in such an authentic atmosphere of
wind and powdery snow. for you can actually
momentarily interrupt the horizon with your
presence.
