The ancient Greeks often placed their sanctuaries and temples in Iocatione'
of spectacular scenic beauty. The sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi. the Temple‘

of Aphaea'on Aegina. and the Temple of Poseidon at Cape Sunium will serve
as examples. The latter stands on a rocky promontory I97 feet above the sea,

not only in the literature of ancient Greece itself but also in that of 18th and
I9th century England. . ‘_

William Falconer. is native of Edinburgh. was both a poet and a sailor. He , _

survived shipwreck twice. once in 1760 in the British Channel. and once in
I762 at CapeColon na. bywhich name Cape Sunium was then known. 0n the
latter occasion he was one of only three survivors. In I769 Falconer lost hll
life when his ship sank on a voyage to East India. Just before his last voyage
he published his famous Marine Dictionary. His literaryoutput also includes

a number of poems. the most i portant of which is “The Shipwreck." It is the,

length of a small epic and has been called bysome“oncofthc finest poems in
the English language." We are indebted for it directly to the tragedy of the
poet‘s second shipwreck at Cape Sunium. Understandany Falconer;
describes Sunium not as beautiful but as sinister and threatening:

Music Appreciation  

L" _

by Myron E. Bruin

Many people who consider
becoming involved with “classical”
music feel handicapped in that their
cttpaeity for musicis limited by an in-
ability to hear. commonly called
tone deafness. Actually tone
deafness is quite rare. and can be
determined by a simple test. If you
can recognize a familiar tune. you
tire no! tone deaf. It‘s as simple as
that. and the truth is that most peo-
ple are not tone deaf. In fact. mostly
everyone can begin to appreciate
music if they only give it a chance.

To truly appreciate music. both
listening and understanding are in-
volved. Listening. however. is not a
passive process. it is in fact an active
one. Not only is it important to
rccognin: melodies. but also it is im—
portant to understand how they are
used to make a given piece into a
musical whole. In his book Il’lml Io
I.i.\‘lt'n For in Music. composer
Aaron Copland talks oftltree planes
of listening to music. namely the
Sensuous. the Expressive. and the
Musical planes.

’l'lte Sensuous Plane, says Mr.
Copland. refers to the sound appeal
of music. or more simply. the sheer
pleasure of tire music alone. Some
examples of music on the sensuous

nlune would l1t!‘.,!‘i'tt4linu whit" u
.‘,..uto Is on. music to work by. or

music to think by. While taking in

music this way is not actually listen-'

ing. the sensuous plane remains a
prtmordal element in music ap-
preciation.

Beyond the sound appeal of
music. there is a message in tnusic.
and the search for tis meaning is
listening on the Expressive Plane. “Is
there meaning in music'!.“ asks Mr.
Copland. “Yes. Cttnyou state in so
many words? No.“ In fact very often
music takes on different meanings at
different times or means different
things to different people. But there
are some who claim that there are
only musical meanings in most
pieces. A good dculol‘music. namely
programatic music. deals with a
single extra-musical concept or idea.
However. a majority of symphonic
music is not simply that way.

the third. and highest plane of
listening is tltc musical plane. l‘his
deals with tltc intellectual understan—
ding. of music in terms of the notes
themselves and their Imtnipulation
by the composer into a work of art.
Most people usually recogui/c
melody and sometimes recognize

rhythm. liew. however. recognize

harmony-tone color. ()rntm-i :.....
 ...,rn m the music they hear.

Similarly. lyrics in choral music are
all too often ignored.

Appreciating music entails un-
derstanding it. for anybody capable
of recognizing a theme can ap-
preciate music. The intelligent
listener must be prepared to increase
his or her awareness of the material
and what happens to it. Allow
yourself to hear melodies. harmonics
and tone colors in a more conscious
fashion and follow the line of the
composer‘s thought. Listen actively.
Develop a deeper understanding by
being a more conscious and aware
listener. not by just listening. but by
listening for something.

Bad Sound Hurt Bromberg

by Bob Lent and Joe Kraut

David Bromberg’s performance at
Union College last Saturday night
lacked its characteristic excitement
and festive atmosphere. and the
blame must be leveled primarily at
the faulty sound system.

Probably due to some combina-
tion of the'poormix and his lcssthan
ecstatic mood. Bromherg decided to
include in the show an excess of soft
ballads and old-time blues numbers
(since their performance required
less dependenuu on tho emul‘ '“'""

-..,-....__gn these were cxpctty per-

formed and well-received by the
audience. an essential element itt arty
Bromberg concert is his rocking.

comedy songs. The latter were sorely
missed Saturday night. When such
traditional Bromberg' crowd-
pleascrs as “Sharon” and “Kansas
City" did make their appearance. it
wasn't the same.

Almost from the outset. it was ap-
parent that something was wrong.
After the popular and infrequently-
pcrl'ormed “The Hold-Up."
Iiromberg acknowledged cries from
the audience that his voice could not
be heard. “I was born with this." he
uwuruhtu. “Speak to the sound
rnalt." It was unfortunate that the
sound mix prevented Brombcrg
frotn really letting loose. since he‘s
one of those charismatic performers
who really seems to communicate his
enthusiasm to the audience (and
perhaps what tnost put a damper on
the cvcuingwas that Brombcrg didn't
seem to be enjoying himself). Even
his acoustic guitar seetncd defiant.
causing hitn frequent tuning hassles.
“I swear it wasin tune when Ibought
it." he noted.

When Bromberg didn‘t have to
worry about the voice tnicrophoncs.
his versatile group performed its
usual block-busting instrumentals.
ranging from bluegrass to Dix-
ieland. liromberg‘s backup groups
are notable for their in-
terchangeability. and this one was a
potpourri of past chronics. What
usually remains constant. however.
is their muscial excellence. Here was
little room for disappointment.

The abbreviated brass and wind
section of Billy Novick and Peter
Ecklund really shone (although
Novick did tend to be somewahtofa
ham). and the bass and drums were
better than adequate. as usual. What
was somewhat disappointing.
however. was the fact that the two
line fiddle players couldn’t be heard
through much of the set.

In evidence throughout the per-
formance were, Bromberg's
‘0»...mmranc musical proficiency
and versatility. He never ceases to
awe audiences with his lightening
quick guitar licks and incredibly in~
ventivc runs. and appears almost
equally competent on mandolin. ﬁd-
dle. and dobro. In fact. hisdobro lick
on one of the instrumentals was so
good that it would‘ve been difﬁcult
to find a Nashville picker to
challenge him. H is “flat picking" was
technically superb during the even-
ing and relatively free from the mis-
takes that Bromberg's critics claim
frequently flaws his playing.

Despite the fact that this was
definitely not one of Bromberg's
better shows. he certainly gave the
audience their money‘s worth.

One of the brighter notes of the
evening was the warm-up group.
“The Buffalo Gals." an ensemble of
female bluegrassers from Syracuse.
Their harmonies were soaring and
beautiful. and although they may
have suffered. on the whole. from a
lack of better-than-average
musicianship and experience before
larger-than-col'fechouse-size
audiences. they do happen to possess
one of the best banjo-pickers around
(“Bottle Hill Boys" and “Country
Granola" beware). She was good
enough. in fact. to be called up by
Bromberg to pick on a few of his
numbers. and she refused to be out-
classed. It was a refreshing surprise
to hear female performers of
bluegrass—a traditionally male-
dominated area of American music.
