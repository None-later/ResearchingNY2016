I Since the coming of the first white invaders

 from across the seas. more than 400 treaties
and agreements have been made between

"in/Independent Indians of All Tribes and the

r U.S. ~govemment. The passing of the years

 have taught us that the white man has broken

';and abused every one in the name of your

YILI'reedom and democracy. Treaties are Sacred

. agreements made between sovereign nations

} and are upheld by the constitution. Do those
documents that supposedly bind this nation's
spirit mean so little?

 ' Many treaties guarantee Native People
their land for as long as the grass shall grow
and the rivers flow. These treaties are .rIi/l
legally binding and the people of this nation

v have the obligation as citizens to uphold their
integrity.

I The question of sovereignty is of prime
importance in understanding the

O contemporary Native situation. Indians are

not Americans living on American soil. We
are of our own nations and of our own lands.
This is the most difficult thing for most people
to accept. Why can‘t you? In I924 your
government passed a law making all Native
People citizens of this nation. whether they
wanted to beor not. Forthosc who sought this
status it was a noblcgesture. but for those who
did not. a cruel imposition. There is a
provision in_ItIhe charter ofthc United Nations
forbidding 61w nation from depriving the
nationality of another and stifling its self-
determination and self-realivation. Your
nation's relationship with the Indian Tribes is
probably the most blatant case of colonialism
in the world today.

Al'tcrcouniless numbers of frustrating years

Native People are'taking violent measure in a
tinal attempt to resecure what morally and
legally is rightfully ours. as provided for us by
the Creator. We 'are called “militant Indians"
and “criminal dissidents“ by the government
and media because we are ﬁghting for what is
ours and arciprmeeting our homelands and
Loved Ones. Why not call us patriots? Yet you
call men like Washington and Sherman
patriots. for defending a land they butchered
and stole for. They lied and you swear by
it.....the mockingbird sings it. its all that she
knows.....

No man hits the right to set a price on land
and sell it.0ur Motherisnot to bedividcd and
parccled by imaginary lines and fenced iit. We
do not respect these separations. She is here
for all of us to share in and enjoy. Through his
greed and arrogatiec the white mitn has
succeeded in destroying many of our Holy
Places and our Brothers and Sisters of all
kinds.

I’ rices are affixed according to political and
economic potential. with no regard for the
spirituality of the land. These people sell their
own Mother for money. that beautiful green
money SSSSSSSS. They are rich.the people are
starving and the Earth is dying. And this yoti
allow. 'I'ry eating your money when you‘re
hungry or using it to \ 'arm you‘in winter. You
can‘t even come to terms with the artificiality
you‘ve created and continue to perpetuate. as
the best attd only way. And the band plays on.

In this concrete place there are not spirit
seekers

Rapid City. South Dali'olu. June 9, I 972.-

As late afternoon drew to a close. ominous
Warnings began appearing. advising the
people of Rapid City of a possible flood. The
rain started to fall and fall and fall and fall.
Near midnight. the surging Rapid Creek River
pushed away Canyon Lake Dam and washed
into the city. sweeping up people. cars. trees
and houses. The gushing \vatcr ripped up
eighty blocks of pavement. covered 20%of the
city in mud. snapped power lines and shut off
the gas supply.

Whole families were lost. Some people
managed to scramble onto roofs or into little
boats. liut others were less ablcand less lucky.
One hundred million dollars later. insiirattee
adjusters and state officials pondered the
situation. It was a tragic occurrence. but after
all. what could be done? A ﬂood is. ofcoursc.
ati “act of God."

liut was it'.’ It appears that this “act of God“
may have received a big push from salt crystals
injected into clouds in the vicinity of Rapid
City earlier that afternoon. “l'rojecl Cloud
Catcher.“ a weather modification experiment
undertaken by the Institute of Atmospheric
Sciences at tthouth Dakota School of Mines
set the stage. Available information indicates
that on June 9. seeding caused unusually
heavy rain and that these clouds were
carried 'sliil raining-over t\vo watersheds
which in turn fed them with more moisture.
Confronted by opposing weather forces. tltesc

clouds poured water into and around Rapid
City for the next six hours!

The implications are obvious. The infinite
variables involved in weather modification
make it a field where the utmost precaution
must be taken to prevent disaster. Slide rule
calculations fail to realize thata raining cloud
is not a “thing.” but a process.

Weather modification is an idea which has
grown with leaps and bounds in recent years.
The original rationale behind the concept was
to increase the amount of moisture in given
geographic locations. ultimately bcncl'iiting
farmers through improved crops. better
grilling and other related aspects. Ilut how
advantageous is 2040",? more rain when the
natural topography of a region is not
adequately designed for storing or distributing
the sudden growth‘.’

Cloud seeding is an idea which works on
paper tnorc successlully than it does in the air.
As the Interior continues to play in it‘s Lab in
the sky. what excuse is offered for the damage
and loss of life inctirrcd in situations such as
Rapid City"!

The danger involved in experimenting with
titc heather was unwittingly hinted at by Dr.
I’icrrc St. Antand. chairperson tor the Board
of Inquiry which investigated thccatastrophc
of Rapid City. St. Atnand is quoted as saying.
"You can go ahead and work on them (clouds)
all the time a nd not really have anygrcat cause
for concern. bill you still have to adopt the
same precautions that you'd use when you‘re
playing with a rattlesnake.“
