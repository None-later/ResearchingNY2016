SEX CRITICS

The son of the late Congressman,
Hale Boggs. says that the F.B.l.
secretly gathered and disseminated
information on the sex activities of
critics of the investigation of the
assassination of President John
Kennedy.

Hale Hoggs was a member ofthe
Warrcn Commission. which in—
vestigated the J.F.K. assassination
eleven years ago.

His son. Thomas. states that his
father was given information on
Warren Commission critics by the
F.ll.l. in order to damage their
credibility.

'l'homas Boggs further states that
his father was encotrrugcd by the
l".ll.l. to release personal informa-
tion and compromising photos of
the critics in an effort to stifle
criticism of the Warren Commission
Report.

The younger Hoggs says his father
regarded the l".ll.|.'s actions as
“(icstapo tactics."

'lhe F.ll.l. has confirmed that it
gathered information on Warren
Commission critics. The Bureau
states. however. that it does not
know ifthis information.or material
was disseminated publicly.

BEAN_cH:eks
ToeuAus

For the past thirty years. Dr.
William Bean has been involved in a
curious occupation.

Bean. a Galveston.Tcxas, physi-
cian. reports he has been carefully
measuring the growth of his left
thumbnail.

Bean notes that his thumbnail
grows more slowly when he‘s sick.
and as he gets older:

 

“Call lbur FTD
Extra Touch Florin" sac

 

Send the ‘FTD
ioveByndIé‘fof
‘VaIentefW

own Prices’

 

u

i am also found out. over the past I

three" decades. that his toenails grow
l't'tsterthenjhis fmgemaits.

And iri'case you‘re still interested
in Dr. Bean‘s numerical data. Bean
reports it takesbetween a hundred to
I50 days for a nail to grow from its
cuticle to its tip. l

The best thing about his research.
Hean says. is the cost: it doesn‘t re-
quire a federal grant.

TOBACCO SPITS 900

An Oregon State student has cam-
cd $|00 by drinking ll ounces of
chewing tobacco spit deposited by
his friend.

Sophomore Tim Lee agreed to
swallow a Vspittle full of the “chew
brew" for $|00 on a dare from his
friend. John Heller. Lee and Heller
were returning from a gambling trip
to Reno. Nevada. where Lee had
been a loser and Heller a winner.

Heller says he decided to give his
friend a chance to win back some
money; so he proposed the event
with one stipulation~that Lee must
not throw up for at least an hour
afterdowningthe contentsofthespi-
tooit.

Despite prodding and teasing
from 25 onlookers. Lee lasted the
hour and even felt ﬁne the next day.
Heller said later: “He almost threw
up two or three times. and I tried to
psyche him into doing it. liutaftera
while, I figured he deserved the
money."

T.V. CONTROL

The White House says it has
scrapped a controversial plan that
would have required all television
sets in America to have special
emergency equipment whiclt could
be switched on rcruotely by the
Government.

Under the (iotcrurneut‘s
“Emergency Warning System"
proposal. every T.V. set in America
cottld have been turned on instant-
taneously at the conunaud of the
White House.

However. the White llottse office
of l'clccomntunications says it has
decided to abandon the plan because
it sounded like something otlt ot
(icorge ()rwcll's I984.

fires orients: 

The United States is ofﬁcially in
the throes ofa recession. at least this
is the report from New York City
garbage specialists.

According to the Department of
Sanitation there—for the ﬁrst time
in IS years—the volume of garbage
in New York City has declined.

At the beginning of I974, 3|.000
tons of garbage were reportedly
collected each day. In recent weeks.
however. the daily garbage has
dropped drastically to 29.000 tons.

NUCLEAR HASH

A former Army code specialist
reports that he and other G.|.‘s
stationed overseas regularly smoked
hash while working with U.S.
nuclear weapons at bases in Ger-
many.

In an interview with the
ll’ur/iingmn Slur-News. Donald
Meyer states that dozens of people
he served with who handled nuclear
weapons smoked harsh to escape
from boredom.

Meyer estimates that 95 pcrcentof
the 74th Artillery's 225 Member
Missile Detachment used hash dur-
ing the 29 months he was there.

Meyers says he smoked the drug
not only around nuclear materials.
but also when he was working with
classified military documents.

tion in the same category as such
hard drugs as heroin.

MANURE MEANS

converting animal manure into
uscable energy?

Well. the Environmental Protec-
tiort Agency has turned all those
theories into fact.

The Enviroanrotection
Agency reports that the nturul Gas
Pipeline Company of America has
agreed to purchase 640 million cubic
feet of methane gas from the
Calil‘oric Recovery Process of
Oklahoma.
