two such solo spots. with keyboard
man Mileho Leviev and bassist Alex
Bhke each taking a turn in the
spotlight. They were aided
throughout the remainder of the
concert by the four other members of
the group: Randy ‘Brecker on elec-
tronically augmented trumpet;
Michael Breckcr on woodwinds'.
John Seofteld on guitar; and Glenn
Ferris on trombone.

Cobham gave SUNYA another
taste of the fast. loud. jazz/rock

Cobham‘s variety is a more abstract
form of music. concentrating less on
traditional song-melody concept.
moving away from employing the
drum. bass and brass as a rhythm

a group of seven lead instruments.

There were some prpblems with
the sound system. A lot of undesired
feedback was coming through. one
possible reason why the concert was
so short. The group only played an
hour and a half with no encore——

though it was obvious the audience
wanted one. Another sound
problem. at least for the audience.

A much better concert could have

admission price and the late hour of
the concert. it doesn‘t seem too ex-
treme to ask for a little more than
just ninety-live minutes of Cobham.
An opening act could also provide

offer a point of comparison.
Zeppelin may not need a warm-up

(ZNS) Gene Roddenberry. the
creator of the T.V. series “Star
Trek." says that negotiations are un-
derway to make a full-length movie
version of the popular show.

The movie. says Roddenberry.
will feature the original "Star Trek“
cast. including William Shatncr in
the role of Captain Kirk and
Leonard Nimoy as Officer Spock
from Vulcan.

Roddcnherry told Sunrise
magazine that if the movie version is
successful. “Star Trek" might return
to television again—this time with
two orthree specials per season.each
two-hours long.

Roddcnbcrry‘s theory on evolu-
tion is that since the dawn ofciviliut—
tion. societies have undergone
repeated collapses and rebuildings.
He suggests that the society “Star
Trek“ portrays may therefore not be
the result of an orderly and un—
interrupted continuation of the 20th
century culture.

Roddenberry submits that it may
be part of society‘s natural processes
to crumble and be reborn.

Before any apocalypse.
Roddenberry suggests. a civilization
becomes “Unglued.” with pockets of
humans surviving the particular
holocaust and eventually construc-
ting a new society. In this light. he
states. humanity has infinite oppor-
tunities to achieve a higher
evolutionary plane~onc
Roddenberry forsees as an in-
telligent species embracing the prac-
tical ability to love.

Trek Revival?

Walt Disney productions filed suit
in court last week to stop the use of
the Mickey Mouse Club song in the
soundtrack of a movie depicting an
orgy.

Lawyers for Disney Productions
complained that the familiar
“Mickey Mouse March“ was used as
background music in a scene of "The
Life and Times ofa Happy Hooker.“

The suit stated. in part. that the
orgy scene constituted “substantial
and irreparable injury. loss and
damage to ownership rights.“ The
lawyers also pointed out three of the
four participants in the orgy were
wearing Mousekcteer ears.

Disney Productionsis seeking a
preliminary injunction against
showing the film and punitive
damages for copy right infringe-
ment.

Wilson Exhibit at Art Gallery

by William Grimes

The new William Wilson exhibit
which will be on the gallery floor of
the SUNYA Art Gallery until
February I6th, includes some very
good paintings. Most viewers will. I
believe. find it an intriguing and
provocative show. Twelve of the
fourteen canvasscs constitute a series
which Wilson calls “Cover-Up“ or
“Overlay” themes. these all done in
I974; the two paintings outside the
series were done in I973.

"()verwhelm" is one of thcpaint-
ings in the series I find particularly
impressive. The canvas is sharply
divided into upper and lower areas:
the Upper presents a stratified rock
escarpment (the kind common along
the Helderberg ridge). richly
developed. full of movement of light
and shadow and subtle color
pattcnts. Delicate ferns emerge from
serrated rock. The details create it
pleasing choreography.

"‘l'orn Skier Overlay.“ another
member of the series. has a number
ofsimilarities ofconccpluulconlcnt.
tltough the two are in form very
different.

Across the gallery the f'Ech
Knieval I’ostcr Overlay" seems on
first impression to be a close compa—
nion piece ibut ﬁrst impression in
this case is rather deceptive. From an

art achievement standpoint this may
be the most outstanding painting in
the show: artistically fascinating.
perhaps repulsive. but humanly dis-
turbing. The ambiencc of machismu
is sharply delineated in a synchroniz-
ed multiplicity of ways. The painting
consists of an "overlay poster" in
brilliant primary colors“taped over“
abuse painting depicting two figures
in sexual activity whose form and ac-
tion are quite fully given. though
only the outercdges are left revealed
by the covering poster. 0n the
overlay a dare-devil “easy rider“ in
dramatic swashbuckling garb. is
curooming his powerful motor cycle
in fast thrusting movement from left
to right of the painting a line of

thrust that corresponds with what in
the background painting would be a
sexual thrust into the woman. But in
the background painting there is a
counterpoint thrust in the opposite
direction generated by a posturcthitt

impression of it synchrony of sexual
acts.

The paintings I have discussed,

developed and aesthetically
successful of this Wilson series.

All roads lead to Rome. and

much is common knowledge. It is

however. hillsites invited settlement.
especially if they offered it good
supply of water. as Amman did.

In Old Testament diiys Amman
was called Rabbiih or Rabbiith Arn-

Jerusalem the city escaped destruc-

In Hellenistic times the city was
renamed Philadelphia by Ptolemy

Egypt. It continued to be known by
this niime under Roman rule. Herod
ttf.lut.ltlt.‘tl included the city in hisdo-
main. Later yet it was the sear of a
Christian bishopric.

Archaeological evidence of the
long and vuricd history of the cityis
