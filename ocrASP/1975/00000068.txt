State IWIll‘lmtng team mighthave its
that winning season in its six year
history. The mermen defeated Os-
wego on Saturday by a score of 59-
.52. to bring the overall record to a
solid 44.

Albany placed first in 9 out of it
swimming events. and broke a
number of school and personal
records. deﬁnite signs of improve-
ment for a teamthat is sharpening up
and preparing for the University
Center championships on February
22.

The swimmers took command at
the start of the meet by winning the
Medley relay with the team of
Siebeekcr. Seidenberg. Mitch
Rubin. and Mike Volpe. This was
the first meet Volpe wasablc to swim
since he punctured his car drum a
few weeks ago. Nevertheless. the
"Don" as his teammates call him.
was able to come through with a
strong swim as anchor for the relay.
The win and Volpe‘s performance
gave Albany the momentum right
from the start.

Dave Rubin dazzled the fans and
the swimmers witlr his performance
in the next two races. He was to
attempt and win “the double“. oneof
the more difficult feats irr swimming
competition. The “double” consists
of first swimming the 40 lap l0ll0
yard freestyle. the longest and
perhaps most gruelling races in
swimming. Then in the very next
nice. one has to swim the 8 lap 200
yard frecstyle'.a race comparable to
the 440 in track. in that it is slightly
too long to sprint all otrt the entire
way, yet it is too short to relax into a
distance pace.

Rubin was two minutes ahead of
the nearest competitor in the I000.



He swam a smooth. consistent. and

comfortable race..making sure he
did not lose;'and taking care that he
did not overtire himself for the 200.
Even with the relaxed pace Dave still
ﬁnished the race in ll:00.777. only
two seconds off the school record he
set at Potsdam last week. When ask-
ed about the race Dave replied that
he. “didn‘t feel it untilthe34th lap."

With a short two minute rest
between the races. Dave stepped up
on the blocks to swim the 200. The
assistant Coach asked him to feel his
pulse. It was racing away at l40beats
per minute. In the initial part of the ,
race Dave looked as though he was
barely holding on. Swimmingin lane
5. he stayed at the shoulders of' the
swimmers in lanes 3 rind 4 for the
ﬁrst six laps of the race. In the last
two laps he seemed to reach for some
hidden reserve of energy as he pulled
away from the ﬁeld. winning the race
with a time of l:55.253. anew school
record. After this point. both Dave
and the rest of the team Were riding
high.

'l'wo races later Dan Dudley and
Ben Siebecker swam exciting races
for .‘a sweep in the 200 yd. individual'
Medley. Dudley was way ahead of
the ﬁeld with a linrc of 2:! L3. It
appears that Dan is beginning to
come around. after being somewhat
sluggish in the last few meets.
Sicbecker swam a great race. pulling
ahead of the ()swego swimmer in the
final two laps of the race to place sc-
corrd with a time of 2: [5.4. This was
Ilen‘s personal best by 3 scco lids. and
places Jinn in the top field of
ntcdleyists ill the coming University
Center Championships.

Albany thought they would be
without a diver because Art
Rosenberg was out with the flu.

In the 200 yard butterfly Mitch
Rubin swam a good race to place
ﬁrst with a time of 2:l3.2. Mitch
entered the race tired from the
Medley relay, and the low yard
freestyle. yet' still managed to go
neck and neck with Oswego‘s ace
swimmer. Van DaBogart and to pull
it out for the win in the last lap. It
appears that Mitch Rubin is back in

Women

by Mike PIekarskl

Maybe it just seems as if the
Women's Varsity Basketball team is
on a roller coaster... First up. then
down; up. then down. For instance.
after clobbering SUNY Conference
rival New l’altz 70-38 at University
Gym Thursday night. they went
right up to Colgate and were beaten
56-39 two days later to leave their
record at an unimpressivc 2 and 5 on
the season.

Road Blues

At home so far the women are 2
and l.whileon the road they have no
victories in four attempts.

Thursday night's game wasahnost
a replay of the Binghamton contest
as Albaliy cl old do no wrong. while
their opponent could not seem to
locate the basket. Vita Davis put on
an outstanding performance for
Albalry as she came up with 25
points to lead all scorers. while pull-
ing down an incredible 25 rebounds!

l'hc 'Darrcttcs seemed to be
pcnetrrrting early and well lit the first
half. while New ’altz was having no
such luck“. settling for the outside
shot which was not falling with any
great consistency. Ilul for the first
few minutes. both squads were hav-
ing their scoring woes.

Davis scored first for Albany via a
frcethrow.bcfore New I’altz grabbed
the lead on a Janet Caterina layup.
The lead then switched hands three
times. before Wendy (iath‘s l7-
footer put Albany ahead to stay at 5-
4 with ltr:42 remaining.

The women never lost the lead
from there on. although they were
tied twicc. A Davis laylip offa Vicki

the touch'aiid-coming in *just one . _
. tenth of a second ahead ofthe second

place finisher. and lthrce tenths
ahead of third place. After this cVent.
Oswego's hopes of winning were
completely subdued.

In the 200 yard backstroke Rick
Masom swam way rthead of the ﬁeld
for the ﬁrst place. Dan Dudley plac-
ed second. also Well ahead of the
nearest competitor.

Dave Rubin came through once
again to break a school record and
win the 500yard freestyle witha time
of 5:l3.092.

The breastroke duo of Seidenberg
and Dudley swept the honors with

Split

driving hoop. a Sue Winthrop offen-
sive rebound and bucket. plus two
more Davis baskets and it was now
15—4 with l223tl to go. Albany was
able to fast break successfully as
Davis and Girko were rebotlnding
very well. limiting New l’altz to only
one shot at the basket.

But it was not to be a runaway.
just yet. With Caterina and Sue Irish
finding the range for New I’altz. the
visitors came storming back and tied
the score at I9-l9 on a Marilyn
Benton jumper at 6:02. Both learns
traded buckets and with the score
knotted at 2|. Albany exploded for
I l consecutive points to virtually ice
the game. Davis and Dower were
primarily responsible for the surge as
their hustling defense produced
basket after basket via some pretty
steals.

The halftime state showed the
frosts ahead by a 34-25 margin with
Vita Davis leading all scorers with
l4. Sue Winthrop added six to the
Albany total. while Caterina and
Ileaton led New l’altl. also with six
tallies.

In the second half. Albany played
very fine tcarrr basketball with
everyone contributing in some way
to the winning cause. The hosts just
kept piling it on and pulling away;
building up a 50-32 lead at the
hallway mark as they coasted to the
victory.

With Russell Clarke spoiling
every comeback attempt by the
Albany junior varsity basketball
team on his way to an incredible Jo-
poirlt night.and his Sierra teammates
jirst slrootilrg the eyes otit of the
basket down the stretch. the llob
l.ewis~lcd l’ups suffered their third
setback of the season lilo-93 Saturv
day night in front of a packed house
at the Sierra auditorium.

Almost overshadowed by Clarke‘s
pcrforrnauce was the one-man battle
waged by Albany‘s Carmelo Verde-
jo. who snared a team and personal
season-high total of 35 points in a
vain attempt to strap the Indians‘
seven-game winning streak.

The victory left the Sierra squad
with ll winsasopposcd to only one
loss (including ii in a row) and
dropped the I‘ups‘ record to 9 and 3
with seven to play.

For a while Saturday night. it-
looked like the Albany State basket-
ball team. was going to pull off the
area upset of the year. The Great

evenly for the ﬁrst twenty minutes.
But in the second half. Albany ran
out of miracles and Siena rolled to a
72-57 victory.

4500 fans packed Siena‘snew ﬁeld -

Albany State. fans. Potter Club was
there with their traditional “EEP
thinks Sicna Sticks" banncrand they
"led the pro Albany chants.

'l'he Danes were sparkling in the
ﬁrst half. as they played solid text-
book basketball. Ed Johnson and
Bob Audi got the offense moving in
the early going. They scored lb of
Albany‘s first I9 points. as the Danes
look a l9—l0 lead. Twice Johnson
was able to steal the ball and go in for
uncontested layups. Albany was hit-
ting tlrc open man and that was
usrrally Audi. When those two
cooled off. I'etc Koola took control
of the offense. hiitirrg three straight
baskets, two after offensive
rebotrnds.

Albany was equally tough on
defense. as its tenacious zoncdcfense
prevented Siena from penetrating
and forced the Indians to shoot from
the outside. The Danes were boxing
out well under the boards and allow-
ed the taller Siena squad only one
shot at the brisket.

took the lead for the ﬁrst time. More
importantly. Holle was able to get
Koola into foul trouble. The Danes
offense started to slow down as they
missed some easy shots.

Johnson put the Danes back in
front btit two Rich Smith fnirl shots
tied the game again. Albany played
for the last shot of the half but the
Danes couldn‘t convert and had to
settle for a 33-33 halftime score.

During the first half. one fan
screamed out “Sierra. I thought you
were supposed to be good.“ And that
was exactly what they were in the sc-
cond half. as they played a complete-
ly different hallgamc. The main
difference was Siena‘s ace guard.
Steve Walters. He had l2 points in
.lhe first I I minutes ofthe half. as he
completely destroyed the Danes.

Walters missed the ﬁrst Sicna-

that this was a replay of Walters‘

mance. when he single-handedly
beat the Danes.

this left Walters open in the corner

Albany didn't help itself in the se-
cond half. Morphis picked up two
quick fouls and he was on the bench
with four personals. Koola had to be
careful as he was playing with three
fouls. The Danes‘ offense in this half
came to a standstill. Albany could
not penetrate and ended up taking
poor outside shots. Often these shots
missed the basket.’l'he team also had
the tendency to play one-un-one
L I A.— II

The biggest problem for Albany
was its lack of rebounding in this
half. as Sicna completely dominated
the boards. The Indians were getting
two or three shots at the basket
before convertiingﬂolle and Smith
were just too much for the Danes.
This all showed on the scoreboard.
as Sierra outscored the Danes 23—9
from the start of the half.

The Danes tried desparately to get
back into the game. Btrt there was
nobody there who could imitate the
Byron Miller heroics of a year ago.
Johnson and Supronowitz were
completely ofl'target as Sicna widen-
cd its lead to I9 points. before star-
ting a slowdown.,A couple of late
buckets by Gary 'lrevett closed the
gap to I5 at the buzzer.

Walters led both teams in scoring.
as he chipped in 25 points. I9 coming
in the all important second half.
Smith and Hollc combiner! for 33
rebounds as Siean outrebounded
Albany. 5I-32.

For the Danes. it was not one of
their better performances. Johnson
was lrigh man with I8 points but was
ineffective in the second half. Koola
played one oflris better games ofthe
year. but he was hampered by foul
trouble. Trevctt. the Danes best brill
handler and Supninowitz. one ofthe
Danes best shooters. both lrad
mediocre performances. Trevctt was
held scoreless till the closingminutcs
and had six turnovers. Supronowitz
shot only l7% from the ﬁeld and
turned the ball over five times.

Loss Doesn‘t Hurt

Albany must put the Sierra grime
into its proper perspective. The
Danes lost to a team which has l7

the sonic number as UCLA.
Emotionally it was a key game but it
doesn‘t hurt the Danes‘ conference
chances.

The big game is really tonight as
Albany travels to Onconta for a
crucial SUNY Conference game.
Two years ago the Danes had their
poorest perl'onnance ofthe season at
Onconta where they scored only 36
points. A loss tonight would
probably eliminate the Danes' con-
ference hopes. A victory tonight
makes the February 22 home game
against Brockport ever more impor-
tant.

Onconta has the same starting
lineup as lrrst year. They are a smart
team that plays very well defensively.
