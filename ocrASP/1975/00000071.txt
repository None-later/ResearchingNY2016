FEBRUARY 14, 1975

 

There is one course that nobody
fails. lt hasbeen offered on hundreds
of college campuses for ten or twelve
years and has been taught to nearly
600,000 people in the United States.
Students who take the course report
that it spontaneously improves their
performance in all their other
courses.

They say that their grades go up.
that their enjoyment of learning in-
creases, and that because they learn
more easily they have more timeand

are more able to enjoy productive
socisl relationships.

The course involves only silt or
seven meetings, esch lasting about
one and one-half hours. and
everyone gets a passing grade.

The reason nobody falls the
course is that it teaches you what is
said to be a completely simple. ef-
fortless, and natural procedure to
contact “pure awareness" at the
“source of thought" and develop
your "full mental potential."

Because it is a nature! procedure.

Class of ’78 Elections Voided by Court

by Peg Mol‘fett

Election results for the Class of
‘78. polled in December. have been
declared void due to illegal ballots
and unfair campaign practices. The
Student Association Supreme Court
mad its decision on February Il,in
Campus center 375.

Petitions for a hearing were
presented by Hans Jansson and
Richard Vllccurro. freshmen
representatives. and Richard
Greenberg, election commissioner.

Possible ballot box stuffing was
the key issue in (‘Irccnbcrg’s suit. He
began an investigation when inllc-

 

commi sioncrs Robert O'Connor of
Colonitll Qultd, 11nd Mllrk Kornfcin
of Indian Qultd. about one hour
after the election results had been
declared ofl'lcizll. Both quads htld
fcwcr voters on the sign in sheets as
opposed to the ilclulli ballot box
count.

According to Greenberg, “No
charge of illegal ballots can be sub-
stantiated without completely 11c-
lurlltc sign-in sheets.“ On Indian
Qulld the cxncl number of missing
sign in voters is unknown but
reportedly itcould be as high also full
day of voters. Colonial Quad claim-
cd approximately 107 sign in voters
(it could be off by it count of 5) but
lllld t1 bllllot count of 171. These in-
llccurncics were considered too
strong to support the declared elec-
tion results.

Hans Jansson and Richard Vac-
carro filed a suit protesting unfair
and illegal campaign practices con-
ducted by Marc Benecke,class presi-
dent. Thcy cited incidents where
their own campaign posters were
covered by Benecke‘s and claimed he
repeatedly entered the. room oc-

invalid for that day—resulting in a
one day extension.

The new election is scheduled ten-
tatively for March 4th, 5th and 6th
on all quads, in the Campus Center
and Alumni Quad. to coincide with
Central Council and University
Senate Elections;- According to the

 

cupicd by the election --
during the ballot counting, even
though he had been told to leave.
Benecke. at the time, failed to
recognize this as a serious request.
The fresh representatives
recommended declaring Marc
Ilenecke ineligible for another elec-
tion.

The Supreme Court censured such
unethical campaign practicesbut did
not feel the violations were severe
enough to eliminate Benccke‘s future
election participation.

Patti Naslilloff, chiefjustice. com-
mented on the election its :1 whole
llnd the court‘s decisions by saying,
“If it was done by accident people
will be more careful; if it was on
purpose—we hope they will learn."

All the major parties involved in
these suits felt the hearing was fair
and were content with the actions
tllkcn.

This particular freshmen election
has It history of inaccuracies. During
the original clcction one name was
removed from the ballot due to ll
misunderstanding on the payment of
dues. The nllmc was returned to the
ballot and the election was declared

is extremely plesssnt. Mediators
claim that they forget they're
breathing. In fact. scientific
researchers have messured whet
does happen to the body during
meditation.

Oxygen consumption drops about
twice as much as at any pointduring
sleep. cardiac output is reduced as is
blood lactate (a chemical linked to
anxiety neurosis). and galvanic skin
resistance dramatically increases—
all of which adds up to a relaxed in-
dividual.

Meditators say that the benefits of
this relaxation to aperson‘s daily life
include such things as increased in-
telligence and Iesming ability. faster
and more accurate solving of
problems. improved academic per-
formance (higher grades), decreased
anxiety. increased inner control and
emotional stability, decreased
blood pressure, improved health.
faster reactions. and improved
athletic performance.

Stipend Reform
Before Council

The big issue before Council
Wednesday was that of “Stipend

Mccklcr. Ed Clll‘cy, Mark Hummer,

bill failed at first, was reintroduced.
and was then ruled lls “pnsséd” by
Chilimllln Lewis Fldicl', ll-il-O. But,
Fidlcr realized after the mcctingthut
because this bill conllicts with an old
policy, it needs it 2/3 vote to pass.
Therefore FidiL‘l‘ilIlSllSkcd SA Presi-
dent l’ntrick Currlln to veto the bill
to compensate for thc crror. Currlln
indictttcd he will do so. The finding
of the study presented in the bill, is
that sulllry docs not motivate people
into SA, so cuts in most stipends
were recommended. Aclldcmic
credit (although not llutomlltic) was

suggested :15 ll viable alternative to
money. Jobs requiring special skills
(such tls the engineer of WSU A and
the Controller) will maintain a
relatively high stipend. The com-
mittee felt that their policy would

The lectures are very informative
