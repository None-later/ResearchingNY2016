. trig the most unique. It is located in
southern Jordan. the Biblical Edom.
From the seventh century B.C. the
area was inhabited by the
Nabataeans. a nomadic tribe of
Arabs. By the second century B.C.
they had taken on a settled way of
life and established a capital of
Petra. from where they controlled
the caravan trade. They resisted
attempts at conquest by theSeleueid
kings of Syria and by Pompey the
Great. Only in too A.D. did they
ﬁnally succumb to Roman power.
Petra continued to ﬂourish forabout
two-hundred more years until it
began a slow decline. All knowledge
of Petra was lost to the Western
world from about I200 to l8l2.
when it was rediscovered by an ex-
plorer named Burckhurdt.

l’etra is a natural. mountain for-
tress. All but one ofits buildings are
cut out of the natural sandstone.
which is generally dark red in color
but offers occasional strands of
white and brown. ‘ l’etra can be
reached only by a narrow. high. and
tortuous cleft two kilometers long
and called tlte Silt.

o horseback.’ begins to wonder

’ . ,‘whether he 'wlll ever emerge from the

gor steep walls of which are

, towering high above hint. he catches

his ﬁist glimpse of a most interesting
building. or rather facade-cut out of
the living, rock. The facade is two

- stories high and features columns of

the Corinthian order. The second
story and the prediment are broken
by a central kiosk which is crowned
by an am. This urn is badly battered
by riﬂe shots because tradition holds
that it contains a treasure of gold.
This same tradition has named the
building the Treasury. It actually
was a temple or tomb. or both. and
dates from the second century AD.
Behind the imposing facade is adis-
appointineg simple interior.

A visit to Petra. difficult to
manage these days‘. is an unforget-
table experience. Petra is not old
stones but living rock ol'unsurpasscd
beauty.

IFG is showing The King of
Hearts this weekend. The King of
Hearts is not a film filled with sex.
violence. supernatural mysteries. or
heavy messages. Hence. it has never
received any great deal of notoriety
or fanfare. Yet. the film keeps com-
ing back to places that it has been to
before and is shown again and again.
Why? Because The Kingq/‘Ht'ttrts

is a very special film. It isu poignant
portrayal of what happens when the
inmates ofan insane asylum oncday
find the locks opened. What makes
this situation particularly interesting
is that not only are the inmates‘able
to leave the asylum. but that the
town where the asylum is located
has. for that day. been deserted by its
inhabitants. The inmates therefore
have the run of the toWn—its
buildings. its shops. and its clothing
stores-~and thus are able to act out
all the fantasies and delusions which
they could only live inside their

minds in the asylum.

Against the actions of the inmates
in the town is the background of the
War which is being fought outside
ttnd which is ' ‘ ' ..
to destroy the serenity of the town
and level the town to the ground.
The war is World War One. The
town is a village in France which the
(iermans occupy. but under the
pressure of British attack decide to
abandon. lIOchcr. before leaving
the town. they mine it. the mines be-
ing timed to explode when the ,
llritish occupy the town.

Alan Bates is excellent in this film.
He portrays Corporal l’umpcrnick.
the British soldier who. being a
language expert (therefore knowing
how to speak French). is mistakenly
sent into the town to dc-activatc the
mines. instead ofthe other Corporal
l’utnpernick. who is the explosives
specialist. As Cpl. Pumpernick. he
infiltrates the town in an attempt to
find the mines. only to find himself
facing the town full of inmates. who

To date. he has one album. en-
titled Alterttatc Plan B, to his credit.
It includes twelve of his original I'lllll

by Spencer Reggie and Matt Kauf- contains ﬁve cuts.and includeswmk

Donald (sax). Mel Collins(sax).and
David Cross (violin). as well as
remaining members Robert Fripp
(guitars). .lohn thtton (bass) and
Bill Bruford (drums and per-
cussives). The ﬁrst track is the title
cut. “Red.” a fast moving. neuro-
Jttu/rock piece. This isl'ollowed by
a mttch slower. harmonious number
called “Fallen Angel." Between these
two cuts. the listener travels to op—
posite extremes. In a a sense. King
Crimson is a “schizoid group.“
producing a wide range of varying
songs. lotense musical tension. up-
parcnt in the tone and execution of
the group‘s songs. was one of the
main internal forces leading to the
break-up of the group.

The last song. “Starless.” was
written earlier during the recording
of their previous album. Sifll‘lt'.\'.\'(llltl

piece they have ever recorded.
“Starless” is an excellent blcttd oftltc
styles and abilities of the musicians
of Crimson. and an excellent choice
for the closing song of their ﬁnal
album.

those who have only enjoyed one

two songs on each Moodics album;
for all those disc jockeys who could
never before play a song like “Ques-
tion" without fear of running into

“How Is It (We Are Here)"; and for i

all those who. through purely
altruistic motives. wish to buy it and
provide the members ofthe Moody

Illues with some pocket cash until ' 
they are able to get back on theirfect r  ‘

again.
To their credit. though. the album

wasn‘t a quick overnight affair.:

Many of the songs are remixed~
evident rigltt from the first cut.
“Question.” The original version has
a blaring ltorn section aiding the
rapid strumming of the guitar at the
start of the sting. whereas in the se-
cond version the horns have been
mixed out. leaving the guitar to
stand alone. Not at all an improve-

tncut. but interesting. There is also a V

nevcr-bcl'ore-released track. “Simple
Game." So even if yott are such a
Moodics freak that you still have a
horn ottt copy of (in Nun". there is a
reason for you to btty the album.
The reasons for tire actual break-
up Ilti\\'t:\ er. are ttot all that clear.
Like King Crimson. there were in-
dividual differences and personal
tensions. but audience expectations
also plttycd a large part in tltc deci-
sion to disband. lhc Moody lilucs
IltILI become an image and the in-
di\idu:tl members felt either that
they didn‘t want to or weren't able to
lttllill that image. Whether this in-
dtcatcs a sinccrc desire to create
something llt.‘\\ as individuals
