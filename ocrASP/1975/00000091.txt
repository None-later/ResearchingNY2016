_ Huis. Clog  

by Roger J. Moran .

Thanks to the joint effort 0
Alliance Francaise and the French
Department. last Thursday evening
saw a performance. in French. of
Jean-Paul Sartre's Huis 0/0: (No
Exit). ‘

The Recital Hall proved an ap-
propriately small and intimate set-
ting for this play. which is based
more on dialogue than on action.

As a vehicle for the transmission ’

of Sartre's existentialism. Huis Clo:
concerns itself with the presentation
of ideas in a straightforward and
convincing fashion.and this through
the medium of words; Action.
though present. is secondary. The
characters torture one another not
'with the rack. but with the spoken
word.

The problems that face the direc-
tor of such an essentially verbal play
are difficult to overcome. Bernard
Uzan (who directed this production
in addition to playing the role of
Garcin) acknowledged this fact in a
general discussion held after the per-
formance. He personally would have
preferred a play that lends itself
more to the visual. but pointed out
that his choice of this piece had to be
based in part on economy. since his
is a low-budget company. With only
four actors. Huis Clos was a good
choice in that respect.

Visually Successful

On the whole. Mr. Uzan was
successful in keeping the play in-
teresting. visually. In particular. the

nominees-so ruaprus .r'q papury

 

 

motif of actors pacing backyand
forth in small areas at various times
was an effective device for marking
transitions.

' The attention given to visual
effects was at its most evident in the
opening sequence which preceded
the text of the play itself. At this
point. the three main actors came
onstage and suffered their deaths
before being judged and sent down
through the nine circles of Hell. all
the while accompanied by projee~
tions of Gustave Dore‘s engravings
of the same. While this sequence was
attention riveting in and of itself. one
could not help but feel that it was out
of step with the rest of the play in
terms of its mood. Granted that the
end of the sequence.where the three

actors chase one another in what‘

might quite appropriately be called a
vicious circle. providesa link to the
rest of the play; one cannot.
however. deny that this sequence
came across as bombastic when
compared to the subtle verbal in-
terplay that is the medium ofSartre.
The contrast was so extreme that it
seemed a case of the director having
to have his fun before getting down
to the business at hand: the text.

More Sound Effects

Aside from the opening sequence.
sound effects were used only twice
during the play. The ringing of a bell
for service was written into the script
by Sartre. The other. the playing of
dance music as Estelle secs hcrcarth-
ly lover in the arms of another

woman. seemed to put undue
emphasis on this sequence thereby
undermining the importance of
analogous scenes of the other
characters. Special effects should
have been used for all or none.

All four actors were well up to
their tasks in terms of vocal and
facial expression.Garein (Mr. Umn)
was by far the most versatiléiirlih’d'y
movement.and contrasted with Ines
whose posture was unvarying and
distracting.

Scrlpt Adapted

Certain liberties were taken with
the original text: certain formulas of
polite speech were done away with.
strong epithets were substituted for
weak ones. certain “impossible" (ac-
cording to Uzan) lines were changed.
Uznn acknowledged and defended
this. saying that a play of ideas. such
as this. ages quickly and must be
changed with the times so that it
won't seem outdated to the audience.
It was a statement that provoked
thought und'causcd reflection in the
audience. many of whom Were not in
agreement.

For foreign language students.
attending a play in the original
language is valuable from two stand-
points: first it reminds them that
what thcyarc studying is not only to
be found frozen in print. but alive
and walking as well; secondly. it can
provide a source of discussion.
reflection. and even controversy. all
of which are vital to the study of
literature.

_.;arrison is Dark Horse

try Jonathan Cunber

This album is really strange. Es-
sentially. it's irt two parts. One is
about Harrison‘s estrangedwife and
the other‘ is about his religious
beliefs.

The middle three cuts of side one,
which constitute the first part, are
pretty bad. There are lines like:

‘You may think about a lady
Cause yourself a minor war
And your life won't be so easy

nnyrnorc‘

And:
‘He feels so alone
With no love of his own
So sad. so bad. so sad.sobad'

While I‘m sure this wusa vcrydil~
licult period in Harrison's life the
music is so dull I lind it hard to get
very interested in it.

In the next cut. llnrrison tries to
be cute. I-lcdocsa version ofthc old
bubble-gummer ‘llyc Byc Love."
with added lyrics referring to his
wife. None of it works though: it‘s
embarrassingly poor. Iivcn the liver-
ly Iirothers did the song better.

The lost song inspricd h)
Harrison‘s ex was fairly good. You
might hch heard of it. It's called
“Irtylrt.”

Surprisingly. thc other purl ol the
album is much. much better. Whilc
the ﬁrst prrrt is dull. lhc second is
refreshing. (By ‘rcl'rcshing‘ I don‘t
mean the childish 'nonserrsc of songs
like ‘Oh-Bla-Di'. but mllrer the sort

of optimistic spirit of a song like
‘Ilerc Comes the Sun.‘) This is best
shown in ‘Ding Dong- Ding Dong.‘

The rest' of the songs are just as
good. and Harrison‘s singing is
better than ever. Though in the past
he's always sounded bored with his:
material. now he actually shows
some enthusiasm.

Harrison musz cxccllctll use of
his session rncn. Listen to thc lhrtcs
on "Dark Horse." l'lcrc. like on Truf-
l‘ic‘s “John Barleycorn" and
Marshall luckcr's “Take the
Highway." the effective use of the
lime lIlanHC5 the song tremendous—
ly.

'lum Scull and the l..A. Express
are on much of the album. and
wherever the) urcprcscnt thcy grcul-
ly cnhuncc thc material. If you‘ve
heard Joni \1richcll's new version of
“\Vorrkstock." you‘ll know how
much llrc) can ,rdd to a song.

My only t'olnplilllll with this part
ol the ulhnrn rs rrs lyrics. We get such
prolountl philosophical insights. us.

“Yesterday. 'l'orluy was
lomorron, And tomorrow. today
“Ill be ycstr~nl;r\ " Very dccp.

( onr'rrrls I‘oor

|l _\'orr'\cbccn loan) ol Harrison‘s
rcccnr concern. you might bc sur-
prised lhul llll\.lll1llllllht)l unyquulr-
l_\. Al the conccrls, Ilurrrsonprcuch~
cd to his nrrdrcncc. and This |ust
.tllcrrnlctl them. He became dis-
gostud \\ rrlr them. us they new with
hon.

For instance. at Madison Square
Garden he said. “If you only cared
about Krishna as much as you
thought about your reefer." And
whcn he song “My Sweet Lord.” he
changed the lyrics to "I really want to
see you Lord. but it takes so long cs—
pccially when your audicncc is half
asleep and stoned out ofthcir minds,
my Lord.“

l’robuhly [nest of the problem is
caused by Harrison‘s audience in~
sisting hc rnuintiun his old licatlc
rolc. l'hcproblem ofan audience not
letting it performer make the changes
he wants to is an old one. Remember
Dylun getting booed off stage when
he first went clcctric'!

In any arse. this album is far
sucrior to its prcdcccssor. “Living in
thc Mulcrirrl World." Like Jot:
(‘ockcr. llt'rrison has succeeded in
putting out it good album after some
terrible concerts. I just hope people
can arcccpt this for what this is. and
not cxpcct to hear the licrrtlcs.

Window My Heart m

I would I were but glass

So you would see my heart

For if I were but glass

you would see how
truly beautiful
I hold you

4. Many other smaller issues. ‘ ‘

ttngulur. always keeping in the spirit
of the unpredictable character of the
music. Such versatility is the
hallmark of modern dance. The
Albany audience. unaccustomed to
such cultural diversity as modern
dance gave Miss Frankela warm and
sincch reception.

The second half of the program
featured Beethoven's .Third
.S'I'nrphony. “Iiroica.” The orchestra
fell short in translating the boldness
and grandeur that this work -so
deserves. Dcspite the technically
good playing by the strings and
woodwinds. the lack of generous

' support by the brass duringclimactic

moments made for a somewhat bor-
ing performance. Conductor Julius
Ilcgyi apparently aimed to bring our
the lyrical aspects of the piece rather
than make it into a showpiece as
many other conductors do.

Author Louise Cuyler relates that
at the first performance of the
"Enrica" one critic thought it a
“tremendously expanded. daring
and wild fantasia“; but Czerny. a
major pianist of the day. recalled
that at the first performance an

auditor from the gallery called. “I‘ll .
give another Kroutzcr if the thing
will stop." Another friction which in-
cludcd Beethoven‘s special coteric of
friends and many cognosccnti of the
day. held that this was the “true style
of high—class music"~ and their opi-
nion has. ofcourse. turned out to be
a prophe‘tic o'nc. Thcla‘Eroicu“ an-
nounced in vchemcnt tones that the
day of music as an cxnllcd art that
approached a religion had come.
“Music.” says Cuyler. “has never
been the same since then."
SUNYA support of the Albany
Symphony has been quite extensive
this year. I am quite surprised at the
number of students and faculty
members that I meet or even
rccognizc during intermission. licing
one of the nrain cultural attractions
off campus. it is fortunate that seats
are available at student prices. Two
concerts remain in this yca r‘s season.
The next one. on March l5. will
feature a newly commissioned work
by noted composer Robert l’arris.
The final concert on April l9 will
feature SUNYA‘s own chorus. Both
of these are well worth yonr while.
