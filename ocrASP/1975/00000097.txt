 

,lnwh’at can only be viewed as a defeat for conservativeariti-busing force's-in-New‘ ‘

Yor' thestate‘s Board or Regents retreated from their January 22 busing statement
whichflatly repudiatedthe concept of busing to achieve racial intergration in the
public schools.  the time, the release was seen as a' rebuke to Education
Commissioner Ewald Nyquist', whose staff was pressing five upstate school districts to
integrate through forced busing. ' >

State conservatives such as Senator Richard Schermerhorn of Newburgh, hailed the
January statement as a return to sanity, and segregation. Yesterday's statement is

equally impressive, and demonstrates that the Regents have not decided to return to.

the daysbefore the United States Supreme Court decided in favor of integration in the
landmark case in 1954. If the January decision smacked of Plessy v. Ferguson. the
infamous “separate but equal” doctrine, yesterday’s Regents” policy returned to Brown
v. Board of Education, integrate "with all due speed."

The decision must also be viewed as a personal victory for Nyquist. He alone
successfully stared down the Board. his employers, and demanded from them an
explanation of their earlier decision. That presented the Board an opportunity to
gracefully back away from the previous decision, while still asserting that busing alone
is not thepanacea to cure racial imbalance. While conservatives clamored for Nyquist‘s
outer, the Board reaffirmed its belief in the commissioner and in the principal of racial
integration.

The ferVor with which conservatives jumped on the anti-Nyquist bandwagon
magnifies the shock they must have felt at the Board’s decision. Believing they had a
Board as misguided and regressive as themselves, the hurt must have been doubly deep
yesterday. It is only too deserved. The Boards‘s action represents a sensibly middle of
the road policy in a field where no solution can possibly satisfy a significant number of
citizens. That they recognized the need for the Chancellor to continue his pressure on
the upstate districts which had been forced to abandon only a month ago is a positive
and encouraging step. We welcome the return to sanity.

Hanging the Hangers

Following a four hour act of bravado and pasted-on machisino. tch cw YorkStatc
Assembly gave first passage to the Equal Rights Amendment. the bill to legally end
discrimination against women in any way, shape, or form. On hand at the festivities
were scores of men and women with a simple slogan: 'l'he_l3_l3_A Will l~langUs. It was
their contention that granting women "equal rights"W0llld in the! further subjugate
them and destroy the fabric of American society. Indeed. it was felt that the "rights"
were neither wanted. nor appreciated. '

There are six Assemblywomen this year. and the vote. l28-l5, indicates that the
members are far more enlightened than theirconstituents give them credit for being. In
fact, the woman who was given the honor of introducing the legislation, Mrs. Estelle
Diggs. knew far less about the ramifications of the ERA than most of her male
colleagues.

The anti-ERA lobbying. though intense. was obviously far short of its goal. Though
there were four times as many opponents to the bill this year than last. (six last year).
eighty Asscmblymcn co-sponsored the bill which made the outcome a foregone
conclusion before the four hour verbal gymnastics. Opposition within the Assembly
itself ranged from many of the “Hang Us“ propositions, to some more basic “women
belong on a pedestal“ thinking. Whether mcrely paying lip service to equality. or
because of deep-seated feelings to give women an equal footing in society, dozens of
Assemblymcn rose to praise ERA. and the concept which initiated it.

According to the state constitution. the Legislature must pass a constitutional
amendment in two successive sessions before putting it to a referendum before the
voters iii November. The Senate must still pass the measure and the “Hang Us“ forces
are ckpcctcd to be out en masse. They will be no match, however, for the pro-ERA
forces. which have tltc backing of the mass of public opinion. and a compelling
argument.

If for no other reason than the people have the right to determine for themselves if
they will have ERA in New York, the amendment deserves passage. Equality should
not be it policitilly dangerous word, nor a bargaining tool for lobbyists. ltstime has

Albany TV

by Richard Nordwlnd ,

Tell me folksydocs it say something about
the state of my menta health that, after
watching Albany TV str ight. from 8:30 am.
to 5:30 p.m.. l‘m practically panting in
anticipation. waiting for Mike Douglas‘ next
guest, the "hilarious George Gohel?" In what
condition is my brain. that I start jotting off a
fan letter to Bill Cullen, perennial guest
panelist on “To Tell TheTruth." because I like
his new hair style. (Ported to the left, with a
htilf cup of Wesson oil on top.)

One entire day of Albany T.V. responsible
for this breakdown. If you‘ve ever inhaled
nitrous oxide straight for 31hours,jumpcd off

stuff is easy to imagine. lt wasn‘tsimple Ibet.
to obtain the fuzzicst reprint of “Hogan‘s
Heroes” in the world. and how many garbage
heaps did they have to go through to find “The
New Beat the Clock“ show? The appeal is to
the “typical viewer." and from their program
selection, here is the picture that emerges of
the normal Albany TV watcher: From 2 to 3
years old. no nervous system, any three of the
live sense organs missing.

Before it all starts to jumble into one
depressing lump. let‘s divide the day‘s
programming into sections. so in case you are
suicidal, you can pick the liouroftlie day most
conducive to scllklestrtiction. Here it goes:

 

 

 

 

a 30 foot diving board iitto a pool with no
wtitcr. you conic close to the feeling.
Numbness. Vegetable-like. Comatose.

Forgive me lord. my NY. City snobbery. l
kitow Albany TV must be no worse than a
thousand other places in the U.S. (Nome.
Alaska for instance. or Kanab. Utah). But
somehow this idea persists that if Marshall
McLuhan would have coiiic froin Albany. he
would have never studied the effects of TV on
the average vicwcr. No man could watch Dick
wood. and the “Action News Team" for too
long. without hearing titty tinkling hells in his
head,

()f course the networks supply it majority of
the dopincss. from the charm of raw greed on
displin iii "Let‘s Make it Deal." to the realistic
portrayal til medical services iii America. on
“Marcus Wclby." llttinks to art I".('.C. ruling
however, the networks must now turn over it)
their local affiliates. at least 7 hours of titiic for
their own programming. Rest assured all three
Albany stations. WAST (ABC), WTEN
(CBS). WRU B (NBC) have diig deep to
present you with the finest in adult fare. At a
cost of tens of dollars to themselves.

Where these stations have dug for all this

 

The Morning: Flor and Games.

If you wake up at 8:30 and turn on the TV,
don't be lit red into it false sense ofsecurity. On
W RUB tltc Today show is on, on WAST. AM
Aitterica, and on WTEN Captain Kangaroo,
all of which demonstrate more intellectual
achievement than any other network show.
(Personally. I think Mr, (irecn Jeans makes a
lot more sense than Eric Severtiid, an.1 he‘s a
lot less pompous too.)

At 9 am. you bcgiii to sense the nature of
the .  “Dialing for Dollars.“ is on
against “The David Allen Show." both
lctituring hours oI snappy phone calls to half-
dcad listeners. Sample conversation:

David Allcti: All right Madam, pick it
number | to I3 for one of the lucky keys.

Women tit ltomc: [4.

David Allen: No. Numbers l to l].

Woman picks number. which is wrong.
David Allen says that he is sorry.

Woman: 'l'hat mean I don‘t win iiotliiii. i
don't win nothin‘.’

And air and on. Both shows iirc a thrill, but
"Dialing for Dollars“ has it studio audience,
who do fine imitations of Ionibics.

At ten the grime shows start, featuring tl

.barrage of screaming women. insidious

announcers. and chauvinistic commercials
implying that housewives will have
liystercctomies if they don’t get the dirt from
their husband‘s laundry. Taken asa whole. the
game shows are a more vicious indictment of
the American ethic than any hit of
propaganda our enemies could devise. Asked
one announcer of a middle aged women,
moved to lunacy by the thoughtofSZOOO.“Do
you really want to win'!“ “AAAghl” she
screamed. This, lguthercd. means yes. Best in
the morning: “The Today Show.“ a line

mixture of news and entertainment. Lou-est of

Ilic LUlt‘.’ "Gambit." which forces each

contestant to clap like a seal. every time they

win more than five bucks.
T/ir' Afll'l'llOOIlJ Stu/s and Sl'IlIlltl/ll.

Even in the grimncss ol'al'tcrnoon 'I‘V. let its
look for the silver lining. 'l'lic “Newlywed
Game" is no longer on tlicriir. So much for the
good news.

The soap operas begirt tit ll230 and for the
true addict. willing to switch stations, these
"daytime dramas" cart be seen for four
straight hours. "Like sand through an hour
glass. so are the Days of our Lives.“ is the
introduction to one of the shows, and believe
me. if you watch ctiorigli soap operas your life
will begin to seem like a piece of dirt. You
think you have troublcs'! A woman on one of
thc serials just had an abortion. her husband
ran away two years ago. she‘s iii hive with an
alcoholic lawyer,and hcr kid‘s a scliixoid. For
comic relief. her father llild a heart attack last
week.

A number ol'assumptions are made by soap
operas. One: Life is grim. Even jokes on Soap
Operas arc grim. Two: Things are bad. but
they are due to get worse. Three: Life is a series
of drnntatic crescendos, interspersed with ads
for floor polish and diapers. Four: The world

" rifiday, tits... at. 1915

a WASTeland

is populated by long suffering women.
ruggedly handsomemen, and cute children.
with an occasional light skinned black, thrown
in for variety.

After the soups are over. the local stations
get a chance to show some creative
programming. WTEN goes back to game
shows, in case the three hours in the morning
didn‘t satiate your competitive urge. WRGB
has Dinah Shore at 3 and Mike Douglas at
4:30.(but don't fret “Another World“ fans.
that popular soap opera will be back in the
afternoon lineup by next week.) And best of _
all. WAST gives you. “The Monsters“, “The
Lucy Show“. and “Bonanza.”

What a lineup. huh'.’ imagine a scene like
this: a dreary winter night around 5:30. and
you turn on the tribe. First you see Merv
(ii'illin talking to the iiotcd authority. Dr.
.loycc Brothers (The fact that this woman has
it doctorate should make its all a little humble
ahoiit otircductition.)You turn. thcrc‘s Mike
Douglas singing one ofthi. 400 songs he makes
sound just like one another. Finally. it dusty
rcpriul ol "Bonitn/a". usually with 3 or 4
minritc holes iit it where the plot “its supposed
to hc.

Moments like these sum up somehow
cici'vtliing l have loved about Albany for the
past four years.
lira: in l/lt' (l/It‘l'llllltll.’ The [2 noon news on
\Vlttilt is the best information broadcast in
the area. (iotid coitihinritloii of local and
nationer cvciits.

[fallout of tho IJm'rr'I: You choose. I'm sick.
77W Iii-wring:('l'lrtiiiktiod). lt's All Over Now.

We‘ll start ol'l'withii big supposition: you've
managed to make it through the evening news
with at least part ofyoui' iiiiud intact. From 7
to if things rerilly start getting intense.

At 7:30 every weekday night. WRGB
presents it variety of very cirtc animal shows.
all with very cute titles: "Animal World".
"Animal Land“. "Animal Kingdom"; get the
idca‘.’ Al'tcrwutching the show for two nights. I,
began to have a terrific desire to poison my
neighbor's kittens.

these are the best of the after dintier treats
brought to you by Albany TV. More grime
shows; you just can‘t seem to get enough. can
you? Some nighttime versions of daytime
slioWs. “Hollywood Squares“ or
"(‘onccntnition“. sortie all-time favorites. ‘To
lcll the truth". and some that defy human
description. “The New Beat the Clock."

Ali. here‘s the rub! All these classics of
inodcrit culture on at one time. what are we to
do'.’ My trdvicc1stick with the oldest favorite of
all. “Truth or Consequences“. brought to you
by WAS'I' (who also bring you Jerry Miller
with the News. onc litilfhotir before. so ifthcy
cvcry reconvene the Nuremberg Trials.
WAS’l' will have two things to explain.)

A great spiritual calm descends upon me,
watching this show. There is something
eternal about Bob Barker and his cmbalmed
face. and that same studio audience of fat
inidwestcrn women. all drooling, cross-eyed
kids. all laughing hysterically at the beginning
of the show. [)0 they know something we
doii‘t'! Perhaps Bob Barker is an evil genius
who planstotakeovcr America by destroying
the ntitions's brain cells. one by one. You got
me. Bob. I surrender. Now can 1 get in the
studio audience?

Prime time is next. and one look at what the
national networks thing is entertaining helps
justify the inertia of Albany TV. My mind.
once an object capable of reason. is now the
consistency of ti soft-boiled egg. I am
whimpering in my seat.and dcmrindingto scea
Priest to hear confession. 1 am not Catholic.

Any plan 1 bird of recuperating with late
night TV is a lost hope in Albany. WTEN
picks up all the movies used when the NY.
Yankees iirc rained out. WRGB has Johnny
Carson, and WAST finishes off with an ll
year old re-iun of “The Saint" (One hour of
watching Roger Moore not should finish you
off for good.)

That‘s it. one full day of Albany TV. I
watched for an entire day. arid am alive to talk
about it. And as soon as my eyes focus and
this awful shaking stopsd‘m goingto do it again.
