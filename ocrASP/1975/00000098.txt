Free Music Stores have become
an institution here in the past couple
of years. Much deserving of atten-
tion by the SUNYA community at
large. these concerts feature both
new and recent works by local and
well known composers. On Tuesday
evening. the Free Music Store
featttred a program of “Electro~
Acoustic Systems.“ Three electronic
compositions which dealt with
various tonal possibilities were per-
formed.

“Fontana Mix / Fccd" was a piece
by .lohn Cage which Max Neuhaus
adapted for performance purposes.
Cagc's origitial version consisted
simply of a series of ntttnhers with
which the performer was left to do
anything he wished. In this version
the numbers served as a program for
variotts volume levels whose output
was directed into four vibrating
mechanisms placed on tympani.

As Kyle Kennan was at the elec-
tronic controls. Russell Leblich dis-
played what he calls “Kinetic Light
Sculpture." A laser beam was
directed at a fresncl screen whose im-
age was constantly transformed by
the manipulation of plexiglass
plates. Also included in this display
was artfully coiled tubing. also plex-
tglass. which was suspended and
rotating slowly. When the laser
beam was directed at this object. a
myriad of moving images was
produced.

By the end of this work. it became
obvious that there were a number of
people who have never been to such
a concert. They felt uneasy about tlte
whole thing. Nice melodies and con-
ventional instruments were absent at
this concert. Instead. these per-
l'o-mcrs dealt with a more fun-
damental aspect of music. sound
itself. Some people looked at each
other in bewildemtent. For lack of
anything better to say they asked
cacti other if what they just ex-

perienced was good or bad. Music
such as this. both primitive and ad;
vaneed at the same time deﬁes such
basic evaluation. '

It is important in concerts like this
one to understand the sound element
that is being explored and then get a
basic idea about how the performer
is realizing the composer's intent.
Listening. in itself. to this music is
not the sole etid as it can be in more
traditional music.

The second work on the program.
"Confessions." was also experimen-
tal in nature. although composer
Kyle Kennan did not regard it as
such. remarking that he already
knew the outcome. For the naive
listeners. however. the intent was to
explore the resonances of a bass
drttm. Mr. Kennan struck the drain
on the skin l‘irst.on the cylinder next.
and finally produced a sound by rub-
bing the surface of the skin. These
three sounds were alternately
recorded on tape and replayed
through the drtttn redttcing them
into a single high pitched resonance
frequency. Melodically. this sound is
not very pleasing. although it does
have its own inherent palatibility by
virtue of its uniqueness.

Using techniques sttctt as this.
musicians are discoveringacoustical
qualities of their instruments as well
tts the rooms they perform ill. Mr.
Keenan felt that by performing in
this way. he is accomplishing his
general goal of art. “Art.” lte said.

“lets people know that they are
alive.“

In what began as an idea of
presenting a reverse electronic
process. David Tudor‘s work. “Rain
Forest." highlighted the program.
Normally. complex waves ttre fed
through speakers resulting in a single
endpoint of sound. In this work. the
reverse happened. Commonplacc
objects such asa lawn sprinkler. auto
spring. bell jar. sink. wooden door.
and so forth became an orchestra of
loudspeakers freely hanging about
the room. TrttnstCers fixed to these
objects were controlled by six per-
formers who selcctcd and controlled
a variety of tape inputs_which caused
the objects to sound.

Listeners were ittvited to walk
freely through the room to inspect
the sound objects more closely. For
the audience this piece was an adven-
ture in hearing. Oncusually does not
consider the sound possibilities of
such objects. The pcrl'onnanee was
all the tnore exciting considering the
involycmcnt of the audience. Too
many listenersarc conditioned to the
kind oi music in which they merely
sit back and let it happen. Not so in
this piece. The audience par-
ticipated. and for the most part. en-
joyed it.

Featuring

Earlier in the tour.‘Iead guitarist
Jimmy Page sustained a ﬁnger in-
jury. restricting his performance of
several songs. For years he was a
studio musician. then lead guitarist
with the Yardbirds. and eventual
founder of Led Zeppelin. Page is the
instrumental focus ofthe group. but
oti stage he shares the spotlight with
lyricist and vocalist Robert Plant.
the showman and ham of the group.
At one point. late in the show.a bra
was flung on the stage. and was
promptly picked-up by Plant and
slang over his shoulder.

The release of Led ,Zeppelin‘s first
album earned them high standings
among the FM rock audience; their
second record. especially the single
“Whole Lotta Love." delivered
Zeppelin to the AM masses. Their
next thrccalbumsall proved to be. in
time. equally successful.

The key to their success iti concert
lies with their willingness to stcpinto
their image. While other groups shy
away from performing old hits.
/.eppelin is concerned not with
producing the newest possible show.
but the best possible show. They
selected songs from each album. in-
eluding three from the new release.
I’/ll'.\ft'tll Grill/iii. In particular. two
ot the nttmbcrs were the real

highlights of the show: “No
Quarter.“me Houses of the Highly.
and from the new album.
“Cashmere.”

“No Quarter" was lengthened into
a vehicle for the keyboard talents of
John Paul Jones. providing some
very mellow. eerie sounds as green
bursts of light encircled him.
"Cashmere" begins slowly. then
opens up into a hard driving chorus.
enhanced by rhythmically changing
ﬂoodlights. The end result is an ex-
otic. semi-mystical piece.

No Zeppelin concert would be
complete without “Moby Dick.“ and
a twenty minute drum solo. Bonham
begins his solo with sticks. but later
discards them for use of his hands.
What he lacks in originality and in-
ventiveness he more' than makes up
for in sheer energy. Although some
took this opportunity to walk out to
the lobby and take a break.
Bonham‘s pounding drums and
llashing lights managed to bring
them back. Within minutes.
Ilonham manages to distort. dctune.
and phase the sound of his kettle
drums r-echoing the rythyms
through the various speaker
eolutnns.

Because of Page's finger injury.
