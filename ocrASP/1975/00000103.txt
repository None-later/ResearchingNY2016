You’re
humiliate.
llnw you can
help them.

They've got a long way to

go. In a world that isn't easy.

But with someone's help,

they'll make It. What they need

is a friend. Someone to act as

confident and guide. Perhaps.

t could be you as a Saleslan

Priest or Brother.

The Seleslans of St. John

Bosco were founded in 1859 to

serve youth, Unlike other orders whose apostolate has changed

with varying conditions, the Saleslans always have been — and

will be, youth oriented. Today we're helping to prepare young-

sters for the world that awaits them tomorrow. Not an easy

task but one which we welcome.

And how do we go about it? By following the precepts of

our founder, Don Bosco. To crowd out evil with reason. religion

and kindness with a method of play, learn and pray. We're

trying to build better communities by helping to create better men.
As a Salesian, you are guaranteed the chance to help

he young in a wide range of endeavor . . .as guidance counsel-

ors, technical and academic teachers, as coaches, "

psychologists... in boys clubs. summer camps . . . as mission-

erlos. And you are given the kind of training you need to

achieve your aims. 

The Saleslan family Is a large one (we are the third largest

order) but a warm one. A community with an enthusiastic family

feeling where not only our talents are shared but our short-

comings, loo. If you feel as we do. that service to youth can be

n important mission in your life. we welcome your interest.
