. Explaining thehome-court ad-
vantage in basketball is, of course.

‘ simple enough. The litany of reasons

has been chanted for years until
every visiting coach—and they all
visit sooner or later—can relate them
at the drop of a game: I) visiting
teams are subjected to the abuse of
Cro-Magnon fans in tiny. cramped.
dim gyms; 2) the officials are all
“homers.” and 3) the home team uses
all theilittle tricks. like cutting off the
heat in the guest locker room. . to
make the visitors miserable. How
can any coach be expected to win on
the road with conditions like this
prevailing? How indeed?

Well. the truth is—taking those
difﬁculties in order—that huge.
clean field houses are springing-up
like Levittowns to replace the band-
box gyms; today‘s officials travel
well out of their own Zip Code zones
and are chosen largely by neutral
commissioners. not the coaches;
and. ﬁnally, conference and NCAA
ethics committees have all but erased
home-gamesmanship. So. the home-
court advantage is a myth—right?

Wrong. This year over 70% of
college basketball games have been
won by the home team. The advan-

tage .is as signiﬁcant as it has ever
been. more so in certain areas.

Kansas. which made the ﬁnal four
in last year's NCAA tourney. has
won all its home games and lost six
on the roof. Wichita State has won
all its Missouri Valley games at
home and lost all the others. All four
Syracuse and three Holy Cross
losses were road games. The “misery
on the road blues" have become so
infectuous that it now seems as
though anytime you win on the road
it's an upset. ~

According to Jimmie (The Greek)
Snyder, who studies the “baskets”
from his command post in Las
Vegas. every college team isworth at
least live additional points when it
plays at home; when the home team
-is UCLA. Marquette. Syracuse.
Providence or Indiana. the edge
moves into double figures. Basket-
ball teams remain good for
everything at home. but abrorrd
good for; nothing.

All over thecountry. college teams
are getting better and better and.
with a few exceptions. are ap-
proaching parity. Since any two
teams are likely to be extremely
even. those factors that produce a
home—court advantage will usually

Swimmers Split

"Sometimes you win and
sometimes you lose” and with
Albany State‘s Women's Swim
Team it is possible to do both at the
some time. In the Valentine‘s Day
home dual meet. Albany glided into
first place uglinst Russell Sage with
a winning score of 68 to 62. Unfor-
tunately the some meet showed
Potsdam dunking SUNYA with it
score totaling 84 to 47.

’l'rudy Cornwell. Nancy Kollri.
‘l‘raey HepWorth and Kathy
Maloncy opened the meet with a 400
yard medley relay carrying a time of
5.03. 2. This placed them l‘irstugninst
Sugc. which may have helped the
mermaids psyche Sugc out. but the
same time put Albany in second
place to Potsdam.

’l‘rucy Hepworth took first place
against both teams in the l00 yttrd
individual medley with an un—
touchable time of l.l0.3. Potsdam
claimed second and third place
finishing the race in l.l().7. and
[.190 respectively. 'I'racy repeated
in the l00 yard freestyle winning
with a time of |.03.5.

Kathy Muloncy gave it sirniliiir
race in the 50ynrd butterfly. leaving
Sage and Potsdam behind with a
time of 3|.b. Kathy made another
triumph in the [00 yard butterﬂy
clocking in at l.|0.9.

Not to be outdone by swimmers.

Peggy Redinbtiugh gave total vic- ll

torics for Albany State against all

other divers in the 3 meter and l
meter board competitions.

Debbie Bellush came in third and
'frudy Cornell finished fourth in the
200 yard freestyle ruce. Trudy went
on to take second place in the 50 yard
backstroke event. This placement
was a loss to Potsdam hut was-also a
win over Sage. Trudy repented this
plncement in the I00 yurd
backstroke.

Jane Brisson had an off day its she
finished fourth ,in the 50 yard
backstroke but recovered somewhat
to help support the relay tctim of
llellush. Brissom. Woolis. und Bette
Smith which came in third place in
the 200 yard freestyle.

Nancy Kolln swam the 200 yard
individual medley in 2.582. placing
her in second position to Sage but

determine the outcome of the game.
For example. how can'a team like
Duke University. the last place team
in the ACC. beat a, team like North
Carolina on‘ its home court, then
travel down to Chapel H ill and come
away 30 point losers? But this prac-
tice isn't limited to the ACC. Six or
seven years agovcoaches could look
down their schedule at the start of
the season and pick half a dozen
games they could count on winning.
Now, teamsdon‘t geta single "look",
particularly on the road. Today if
each team plays its average game, the
home team usually will win. Coaches
understand this. The public does
not. Case in point: people were
shocked when Albany State
manhandled Buffalo by l7 points at
home after U.B. had lost to powerful
Canisius by only orie. But coaches
know that the Danes have a good,
sound tema capable of beating
anyone-— especially at home.
Another new factor. replacing
some of those that are disappearing.
is the growing popularity of full-
court pressing defenses. These
defenses. almost always an integral
part of a team‘s offense as well. rare-
ly function as efficiently on foreign.
courts as they do at home. Forjust
one thing. the home crowd. alert to
its team's style. adds the irritation of
wild screams to the rattling effect of
the press itself on the visitors. Rour-
ing home fans willcount in unison us
the visitors bring the ball upcourt. to
make sure they are not allowed more
than l0 seconds to get past thccentcr
line. On the road. however. the
pressing team gets a different kind of

 

"Mluml‘lmmeIII-Iw

pressure from the crowd. 0n. the,
road you simply' don‘t play as
agressive a defense as you do at
home. Many ‘times, violations are
called because the home rooters
pointed them out to the ofﬁcials—
like hacking or blocking. Somebody
will yell about a visiting player.
“Watch Jones, he‘s always shoving,“
and the official finds himself looking
for shoving. The zone press is an in-
timidating kind of defense that re-
quires aggression. lt loses its effec-
tiveness if Jones is reticent, and if
early fouls are colled on him—to his
surprise—his aggressiveness is curb-
edﬁUCLA. using its famous full
court press. has not lost a home
game in four years. Against Notre
Dame in South Bend UCLA has lost
twice in successive years. and in both
games the press was used only
sporadically and was ineffective.
Nothe Dame may have been the
better team in any case. but the fact

remains UCLA did not play the
some kind of grime it plays at home. .
Few pressing teams do.

If “homer” officiating no longer
contributes to the home edge. most
coaches still feel that the crowd docs
exert some inﬂuence. though they
always make sure to use the word
"subconsciously" in expressing this
opinion. Look at it from the officiul‘s
point of view. It is one of life‘s
sutisfactions to feel that you are do-
ingu good job. If u crowd boos you
(the official) consistently you may
get the idea that you urcn‘t doing
a good job and subconsciously you
may try to please that crowd.

7do not add much fun to plane. train

or bus trips— just ask Sicnu couch
Bill Kirsch about Western Penn-
sylvsnia weather. in addition, no
basketball playerbelieves that public
carriers realize the existence of legs.
Neither do motel beds. Many
coaches get‘ psyched. “Gee. We just
can‘t win at Siena." they‘ll say. And
THAT is the real reason people D0
lose at Siena.

So what's thepoint ofall this'ISuf-
free it to say. based on the records
this piece has offered (and there are
certainly similar statistics from
Maine to Califomia.)thehome town
advantage is real and it is strong.
Though the crowds may be im-
proving in their behavior— the hot
pennies. paperclipsand dead fish are
rarities today— no codesof behavior
are likely to inhibit the emotional
outpouring that basketball inspires.
As long as basketball is so quick and
precise n sport.as long asdrumsplny
and pretty cheerleaders cheer in the
visiting coach‘s car. there is going to
be a home—court advantage. The en-
couraging thing is that now. more
and more. this advantage springs
from natural causes and is not
manufactured. the wziy it used to
hc~— when it was strictly a disadvan-
tage to the game.

(Er/ilor's note) Albany State is ll-l
tit ho me, 5-6 on the road. The Dunes‘
lone loss at home came at the hands
of Williums College by it 75-71 score.

The records of other local schools
ulso tend to bear out the home ud-
vuntuge. as seen in the cuseol'Sicnu‘s
recent smashing of it highly rated
Cunisuis tcnmnt theAlumni Center.
