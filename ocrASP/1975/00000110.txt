No different than beyond

The Campus
Job Shortage

by Rosemary Pugliese

ising unemployment is an all
R too unfortunate part of college

life, just as it is beyond the
campus borders. Donald Bielecki,
assistant director of the Campus
Center, and Kathleen Beeckel,
employment coordinator of the
Financial Aid Office, both admit to
fewer job opportunities on campus,
with a dimmer employment picture for
the future. Both place much of the
blame on Gov. Carey's recent freeze
on state jobs. '

Many students have been coming to
his office looking for work, said
Bielecki, but “becauseof the freeze, we
can't hire any more students assistants
in this office." Bielecki is responsible
for students assigned to the Campus
Center Information Desk, and to run
the audio-visual equipment for various
clubs and departments. At the
moment, he has 15 work-study
students under his responsibility.
While the work-study program is
federally funded, other student
worke rs are paid out of a state budget,
called the Temporary Service Budget.
He estimated there are 45 students
now on this payroll,

The University getsa certain amount
of money to create jobs, he said. But
this money has now been frozen. Not
only can't Bielecki hire additional
students, but he must work with the
number he now has. Seven

opportunities have opened in his-

department since last semester, but he
cannot fill them.

This hasn't stopped students from
coming to him. Bielecki said "at least
one every day" comes to the office.
"We have so many applications, the
office is no longeraccepting them." He
pointed to a larger folder on his desk.
"There's got to be at least 150
applications here for about 45 jobs."

Students whose forms are in the folder
will have a long wait. Bielecki will use
these applications to fill any job
openings next semester, but decisions
won't be made until at least April. He
advised students not to have much
hope. The chances of a job are very
slim. He added, "For this semester, the
odds are against them .. .probably 99.9
to one."

Transfers and freshmen probably
have the worst chance of all. New
people don't have as good a chance,
Bielecki explained. "New kids are
really in trouble." Students already
holding jobs stand the best chance of
being rehired, he said.

Bielecki said departments and clubs
are hiring "probably fewer" students
than last semester. "It it wasn't-for this
freew, there'd at least be as many
positions as last semester, or maybe
more."

Ms. Beeckel, who is in charge of
student employment, explained that
the work-study program is federally
funded, so it is not directly affected by
Gov. Carey's freeze. "We had our fund
allocation and that hasn'tchanged, the
freeze hasn't affected that," she said.
But, she continued, "while our money
hasn't been frozen, it has been totally
committed" since the start of the school
year. These funds are not available for
the hiring of extra help in other
departments, despite a need in some
'places for more workers.

. Although there are now
approximately 500 students in the
work—study program according to Ms.
Beeckel, there are many more
applications thanthereare jobs. There
are  . .say, twice as many applications
for jobs as we could fill," said Ms.
Beeckel. '

ul think the trend is to an increase in
work—study applications," she
continued. "Students would prefer,

working rather than borrowing,
because of the overall economy. Some
students have difficulty getting
summer employment. The jobs just
aren't there and the employer is
paying the least that he can." She
added, "I think for the next year in the
terms of the job market for students, it
looks rough. Students will be coming
back with less money in their pockets."

The sagging economy has affected
more than the students' jobs. Ms.
Beeckel said, uObviously the parents
getting laid off, obviously the rising
costs have hit families and affected
their ability to assist the students." She
_ added, "We do get quite a lot of that."
Students come in to the office
“frustrated mostly. Uh. . . frustrated
because things have tightened up
everywhere and there otten doesn't
seem to be a place to get relief. We're
getting busier every year as students

try to make ends meet and try to
continue," she said. Students come in
just to talk. A common cry is "Just a
job!" she said.

Ms. Beeckel doesn't feel qualified to
say what the dropout rate is due to
ifinancial difficulties, but she said softly,
'-"How about all those that we don't
see?"

However, Ms. Beeckel optimistically
pointed out that the work-study
program is not the only way to finance
an education, and encouraged
students to come in to the office to
discuss alternatives. "U sually there's a
way of trying to put something

unmm'“

- helm
together, and it may or may not include
work-study," she added.

As Ms. Beeckel and a secretary
fielded questions from the students
constantly flowing into the office,
others gathered around the large off-
campus employment board outside
the Financial Aid office. But, as Ms.
Beeckel admits, most jobs offer low
wages, mostly $2 or less per hour.

Some students are lucky enough to
have campus jobs. One girl, a Resident
Assistant, explained that she sought
the job out of financial need as well as a
personal desire to be an EA. "It was
both. It had to be both," she said. Her
father recently suffered asevere pay
cut. “He couldn't afford to send me to
school. I had to have a job and work-
study just didn't pay enough."

Another :student, working in the
library, owes her job indirectly to work-
study. She was in the program last

0
. -

year, but is now working under the
Temporary Service budget as a
student assistant. She could continue
at SUNYA if she lost her present job,
she said. "But I'd have to take out
another loan. 1 have two out now," she
explained.

Students still have hopes of finding
employment. Signs in the library
direct students to a desk piled high
with blank application forms. Although
the forms are put on file for now,
according to an office secretary, at
least applications are still being
accepted. ‘
