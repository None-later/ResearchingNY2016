T the old kind of raunchy and

beautiful cotton candy.

lcamival has long paged on
and with it has gone the ageless gypsy
woman, who stares with Dietrich eyes
as she discdvers the secrets in the lines
of your palm and promises love, lame
and fortune so passionately you almost
believe her.

The modem-day fortune teller
marries a roofer, has kids and retreats
to a two-story white house in Colonie,
with a driveway, a front porch, color
television, imitation crystal and red
and pink artiﬁcial roses.

She learns a little astrology, takes it
easy on predictions and becomes a
“reader and advisor" to the many who
can't or don't go to psychiatrists.

When you ask what happenedto the
promises of love, fame and fortune, she
replies, “I only read the past and the
present. The future liesinyour hands."

Despite the drugstore “Come In—
We're OPEleign on her front door,
when a visitor arrives, Anne Cooper
peers past the curtains of her red-
carpeted living room and stares
through the intruder with dark, full-
blooded Cherokee eyes.

She glides around a half opened
door with a suspicious face that could
be twenty, but is much older. Holding
on to her, as she speaks, is a little girl
with red lipstick smeared all over the
same dark penetrating face.

"Oh, what university? What's that?
Right here? Oh really. . .Ididn'tknow
that . . . What paper? I never heard of
that one. What you going to write? Like
the other guy? He wasn't very good."

For someone who's supposed to
know, she asks a lot of questions.

She then sits down cross-legged on
the living room floor looking ever-so-
mystical next I) her "Homes Beautiful"
coffee table. Her long dress falls
around a frail body, but only after she
wipes her mouth on the skirt.

“1 only do character readings and
the cards."

"Tarot cards?"

She nods. “I could not read ordinary
cards if you gave them to me."

“How do you do it?"

"It's a gift, sweetheart. lt's agilt from
my mother and my mother's mother.
Some people go for training, but it

doesn't work. I. hear about these
students who go for training to read the
cards. It doesn't work."
"When did you realise you could?"
"I was brought up on a reservation in
Tulsa. My mother did it. 1 can't even

remember when. It just came to me.

I've been all over."

"Where?"

“Ah . . . i can't remember."

She looks very tired, but continues.

“I have two . . . no, three children.
My little girl is doing it now, too."

‘The character readings?"

Yes, you tell what a ‘person is like
from reading his features."

“is there a way to tell?"

"No. It's a gift. It comes to me."

The whole time she is staring at you
as though you were.a television set.
You begin to worry, but then realize
that it has a lot to do with the
“Hollywood Squares" game show she
is watching in the next room.

Next to the color television, looking
at it, not you, she says,

“I used to read the stars' cards."
Which stars? “I don't remember."

Even if it's true that memory has little
to do with reading and advising, the
modemday fortune teller has to be
careful not to forget clients who have
been waiting patiently until
"Hollywood Squares is over."

Her son, tall, dark and handsome
enough to makeyou sure she conjured
him up, comes in, playing the
prototypical angry business manager
and says,

“You‘ve got people waiting!"

She starts to walk up towards the
bedrooms, to the reading room and she
says to you,

"You'll be back, sweetheart. You'll
be back."

You quickly ask for a reading and
plead poverty since her son has just
informed you they cost $5 apiece with
card readings going for $10.

“1 can't do it now, sweetheart. I'm too
nervous. Come back next week, show
me what you write and then lwill do it
for you. But, don't write bad things
because these kids call me up and use
profane language. There's always a
rotten banana in the bunch."

"l don't know if I can come back

"Oh you'll be back, sweetheart. I
know you'll be back."

remotely smelling of the supernatural.

From behind her curtains, V Mrs.
Anne watches you and the friend you
brought along.

She is smiling when she comes to the
door and asks,

“Did you have a good week "

"l smashed up my car."

“I told you to be careful."

You don't remember that.

Leaving your friend in the hall with a
dubious look on his face, she leads you

upstairs, past a room with a large

unmade double bed and into the
reading room. It is small, dressed in
yellow and white organza and adorned
with pictures and statues of Christ—an
ironic touch considering 12th century
gypsies invented Tarot cards because
they were afraid the Church was
inventing too many spirits of its own.

You sit down across from her and
ask,

"Do you mind if I take notes?"
“You can't. lt'sagainst the religion. Bad
luck. A woman came in here and she
wanted to use a tape recorder. I told
her no. It's against the religion.”

"What religion?"

"Catholic."

"Oh...

She then pulls one of her
metamorphoses, usually brought on
by some very practiced stares, grabs
your wrists tightly, asks you to
concentrate and then scolds you for
not doing it quite well enough.

“Now sweetheart you have so much
going on in that mind of yours."

How can you help it when she just
told you that your lewish mother is
Italian and Roman Catholic. And now
she's playing that "‘correctme" game

again.

It goes like this:

"You once wanted to be something
when you were younger, but now you
want to be something else. Correctme.
Correctme.

“You have a kind face. Correctme.
Correctme.

wThere are a few special people in
your life. Correctme. Correctme.

uYou are going to succeed.
Correctme. Correctme."

And it doesn't take psychic powers
to figure out that the statements apply
to you, Gerald Ford and a host of
others. There's nothing for anyone to
correct and.Mrs. Anne wins every

ime.

Suddenly she grabs your wrists
tighter than she has ever done before
and you get ready for a big one.

She looks hard and says,

"Something is wrong surrounding
your mother. Not your mother herself,
sweetheart, but someone surrounding
her. Your mother doesn't have a large
family, but your father does,"

(That's a correctrno that can be, but
you wouldn't stop her now for a r
personal session with leanne Dixon.)

She continues,

"is anybody divorced in your

_ tritium-hard",  _

""“Well then here must  some

“Only through marriage."

“But that's terrible. Too close, too
close . . . so-o-oo unhealthy ’

“What?. . .OH'. ‘. .Waitl"

You start to ex lainthat all your first
cousins are ceiginly not married to
each other and that what you meant
was. . .

But before you can finish she gives
you a love pat and says she's done.

"Sweetheart, I have a 12:30

reading." -

And like a half hour with the dentist,
it's all over. ‘ '

On the way down you say,

“My friend, he's a writer, too."

“Yeah, I could tell."

"But how?"

"It's a gift sweetheart. It's a gift."

Not interested in following you and
Mrs. Anne upstairs, your friend sits in
the hallway until he is interrupted by
one of Mrs. Anne's “two-no-three"
children named "Kathy—no-lulie”. She
is five and demonstrates that fact to him
by holding up all five fingers on her
right hand. She makes it very clear she
will not go to school until nextyear and
that it suits her just fine that way.

In addition to reading and advising
she enjoysdrawing the same picture of
a sunI over and over again and then
asking you to tell her what it is.

Unlike her mother, Julie only reads
palms, does not have Clients waiting for
12:30 readings and usually hastime to
give it to you straight. She is obviOusly
unconcerned about the mental and
emotional state of your friend, which is
not very stable at the moment. She
looks at his palm and says,

“DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
LINE MEANS?"

“No, what is it?"

- "Wel»l-l-l . . . that‘s your enemy
line."

Your friend, who spends the greater
part of his life offending people, sits up
straight to listen in real good.

“If a line is in front of your enemy
line, then your enemies are in front of
you. lf it is behind, then your enemies
are behind you. Yours are following

u.

And then, in that way children have
of spewmg forth the mysteries of the
world as though they were used pieces
of bubblegum, she states,

"Your enemies are people or
characters in your own mind."

Most analysts would stop at that, but
not lulte.

"You are going on a long trip. Your
enemies are following you on this trip."

You come down with Mrs. Anne just
in time to save your friend from further
mental anguish. Amid wishes and
encouragements the two of you drive
away with your enemies and illicit
relatives behind you.

In your mind is a parting

conversation you had with lulie.

She told you,
"God lets us all read. He says we

"You mean, I can read, too?"
"Yea~a-a—a-h-h—h~h~h."

FEBRUARY 25, 1975

'  prus After

y Paul Koines
yprus, before the recent war
which completely devastated
that country, was one of the
osl beautiful and prosperous areas of
e eastern Mediterranean. Cyprus,
ith a Greek heritage that goes back
to the 12fh century B.C., has a
opulation of 660,000 of which
35,000 are Greek and 125,000 are
urkish. As a result, although the
onomic and political opportunities
r both fractions are equal, the Greek-
‘ypriotes have much of the better jobs
nd a 70% representation in the
ovemment. Exports include wine,
lives, cheese, tobacco, various citrus
utts, shoes, clothing, vegetables,
rain, and some minerals. Although
xports were less than imports (about
32 million and $43 million in 1973), a
tgorous and extremely important
urist trade made up the difference.
Unfortunately, post-war Cyprus
resents a much different picture. The
recrous tourist industry is destroyed
nd two-thirds of the hotels used to
ccomodafe the now nonexistent
urists have been captured by the
urkish army or destroyed. Five to six
ousand civilians and members of the
yprus National Guard are dead and
I to 4,000 are misstng.Thismeans that
‘—-5‘Vo ol the entire Greek population
5 either dead or missing, not to
ention the thousands that are
ounded. Over 250.0000! a fantastic
‘8"/ool the surviving Greek population
re' homeless and about 200,000
ccupy refugee camps. As for the once
ecure economy, it is nonexrstent
ompletely destroyed. We think we
aveunemployment! Eighty percent of
he work force is unemployed as
ompared to a fantastic pre-war figure
f 02%!
The northernmost 40% of the island
is occupied by 40,000 troops from the
ountry of Turkey. This is in direct
iolation of the treaty of Lasounne of
1923 which stated that "Turkey will
ave nothing to do with Cyprus from
this day forward." The 40% occupied
lo the Turks just happens to contain all

.0 the tobacco fields, the drinking

ater source for the capital of Nicosm,
0% of the best farmland and industry,
irtually all of the mines, and the chief

r

ports of the island nation which
recently was ranked eleventh in the
world in the number of merchant
vessels and ninth in the number of
lreighters.

Of the countless thousands of Greek
Cypriotes who had owned farms or
worked at the factories, most have
been killed or driven off. In a plan
initiated by the Turkish army, the
Turkish-Cypriotes, many of whom
were poor peasants, have occupied
the well-worked farms, homes, and
factories of the former owners. Also
you can be sure that the 40,000
Turkish soldiers don't sleep on the bare
ground. Of the remaining Turkish
population of l20,000,nearly 110,000
new live in the 40% northern area. As
for the state and condition of any
Greeks left in the area, this IS
unknown. The Turkish army has
blocked off the zone to Greeks, the
UN, and all foreign news services.
Thus in effect, the area is completely
isolated from the rest of Cyprus.

Recently, on February 13, 1975, the
leaders of the Turkish-Cypriote
fraction announced the formation of a
separate Turkish state from the 40%
occupied territory. The day before on
February thh, Makartos, Prestdent
and leader of the nation of Cyprus,
proposed a system of cantonization
With many segregated Turkish
communities scattered throughout the
island. In this manner, the two factions
would not be completely isolated and
an exchange of goods and ideas could
take place. The proposal was quickly
rejected.

The reason for the formation of the
new state is supposedly that the issue is
ureconcrlable especially with the
rejection of the Greek-Cypriote
proposalol local segregation. Actually,
why shouldn't the Turkish-Cypriotes
agree to a new state? For years they
have occupied a somewhat lower
economic and socral scale. Now they
can control a large area of land with
excellent resources and economic
opportunities and no competitors. The
StltldllOll at present is empty lhtS~— the
Turkish minority which comprises
18% of the population now owns 40%
of the land, 80% of the natural
resources, and Virtually all of the island

ports. Thus 82% of the population has
what is left— basically mountains and
vineyards. Thanks to Turkey, it is now
the Greek Cypriotes who are the
minority. Alter interviewing many
Greek-Cypriotes the general
consensus seems to be this, “The
problem that has arisen is not with the
Turkish-Cypriotes, but with the Turks."

Back in August 1974, while Turkey
was at the conference table, her US.
tax-equipped militarily supplied army
was involved in a major drive that
would eventually engulf 40% of the
island. Opposition to this well—trained
army of 40,000 was a group of 10,000
Cyprus National Guardsman with
ancient weapons dating from World
Wars is ll. Some of the men have had
to use hunting weapons clue to the fact
that there aren't enough to go around.
Even though the Turks were repulsed
three times from the beaches, once the
tanks came, the movrtable happened
and the Greeks lost ground. Against
tanks and the latest NATO jets, part—
time soldiers were using rifles and
pistols of 30 lo 60 years ago. Records
will show that only when the 40% had
been wrestled from Cy priol control did
Turkey cease its main drive. Major
effors since then have been to hold the
conquered area and to keep the
Greeks out.

ft is only natural for the Greeks to
resent the countryresponsibleTurkey
has long been regarded as an enemy
by these people. After all Turkey
initiated several attempts to invade the
island in 1960, 1964, and 1967. These
attempts were thwarted only by the
action of the United States Sixth Fleet.
Therefore the attack by Turkey was
not entirely unexpected. Also
Turkey owned Cyprus from 1571 to
1878, it is a definite military
dictatorship, and Turkey's population
is filling up its land area. By the year
2000,theTurkswillnumberaround70
liltlllOlt- double the present
population.

There is another country, disliked
almostasmuch as'l‘urkey- the United
States.

But wait a minute, the US. an

has in many other serious situations.
Surely Turkey has no right in Cyprus.

The main reason the US. does not
want to get involved is that Turkey is
our ally and an important buffer
against the Soviet Union; and we don't
want to risk offending them.
Conclusion: The Cypriotes will get no
help from the U.S.Thus, there are only
two alternatives the Greek-Cypriotes
have.

One is to accede to the Turkish
demands and settle 82‘Voof the people
into 6070 of the worst land. This I don't
think the Greek-Cypriotes will do.
They are a proud people and have
worked the farms for countless

79 Ce}
generations'l‘hey wrll either light or
enng rate because they have nothing to
lose.

The only other altemattve is to seek
aid front another superpower— the
Sovret Union. ln a radio broadcast of
February 15, President Makartos
stated that he would not yield to
Turkish demands and threatened to
seek aid from the USSR. if no major
western country would help.

ln conclusron: The present crisis has
been gomg on for about seven months
and remains a sorespot which could
prompt Greece and Turkey mtoall-out
