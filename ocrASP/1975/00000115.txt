decadesthe cultural side of Ireland
has been played down to such an ex-
tent as to be close to nonexistent in
the minds of outsiders. ‘ 1

The Irish Cultural Relations
Committee has been trying to bring
out another, lesser known aspect of
its country——ART. It is not through
the ancient paintings and sculptures
traditionally displayed in‘museums
that Ireland wants to become
known, but through its current .
phase of Modern Art.

The Albany Institute of History
and Art is the fourth stop on a 1974-
l976 tour of l I US. cities by an ex-
hibition called Irish Directions of the
70's. Originating in the Ulster
Museum in Belfast. this show dis-
plays 38 works by I8 artists from
both the North and South of Ireland.

These artists are young (most un-
der 40 years old). They have seen
hate and destruction tearing their
country to shrcads. and it seems to
have had a great effect on both the
style and tone of their art.

The forms contrast each other.

(ZNS) A Chicago researcher has
told an American College' 'of Car-
diology Conference that marijuana
might be useful in treating heart at-
tack victims.

Doctor Charles Kanakis of the
Abraham Lincoln School of
Medicine said he has found that
marijuana apparently caused the
heart to expel more blood with each
beat.

Doctor Kanakis says that if his
ﬁndings are accurate. it would mean
that pot could be administered to
combat the effects of a heart attack.
He said that persons who suffer
heart attacks need increased blood
flow, and that the active ingredients
in marijuana seem to do just that.

The doctor warned. however. that
while pot may be good for heart at-
tack victirns. it would probably be
dangerous to persons suffering from
coronary heart disease.

(ZNS) The American Medical
Association is out with a warning
that women who smoke cigarettes
should not take the pill.

The current edition of the Journal
of the American Medical Associa-

tion says that researchers have found
that women who both smoke and
take oral contraceptives significantly

Among countless battles of an-
tiquity'the battle of Marathon is
without question. one, of the most
signiﬁcant ones. There. in 490 B.C..
the'Athe’nians under Miltiades rou-

ted the invading Persians and thus

saved the day not only for Athens

but for all of Greece. Persian victory

at that battle would have radically

altered the whole course of future

European history. One of the par-

ticipants on the Athenian side was

the tragic poet Acschylus. When he

died .14 years later at Gcln in Sicily

his epitaph recorded not his victories
in the tragic-competitions but his
participation in the battle of
Marathon:

“Under this monument lies
Aeschylus the Athenian. son of Eu-
phorion. He died at fertile Gain. "the
famous grove of Marathon could tell
of his hruvcry.and so could the long-
hnircd Persians.“

Most people have heard that alter
the battle one of the Athenians run
all the way from Marathon to
Athens. a distance of about twunty
miles. announced the victory to his
fellow citizens. and collapsed dead.
Hence comes our word murullrun to

describe a long-distance race or
some other contest that requirea
great endurance of the participants.
(But such coinages as telethon or.
even worse. Isululhon make little
sense.) Curiously enough ancient
athletic events. such as the Olympic
Games. did not include marathon
races. Even the story of the original
Marathon runner is found only in
sources of the 2nd century A.D..
while Herodotus. thchistorian ofthe
l’crsian Wars. does not mention it.
Marathon is still Worth a visit.
When Lord Byron visited it about
the year llilll. \vhcn (ircccc was still
under Turkish rule. he was inspired
to pen these lines:
The mountains
Marathon

And Marathon lookson the sea;

And musing there an hourulone.
ldrcamcd that (ircccc might still

be free:

For standing on the l’crsiuns'
