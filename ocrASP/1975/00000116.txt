- The Albany Sta
 second in the University Center I
Championships on Saturday, in .
what was-the most exciting meet of
the season. Albany and the universi-
ty of Buffalo dominated. exchanging ‘ ’ L
the triad throughout the meet.

The ﬁnal score was Buffalo-III. '
Albany-lot. Stony Brook-66. and »
Binghamton-AO. Albany had five
ﬁrst places to Buffalo‘s four, but the
m'ennen were unable to compensate
for lack of depth in the backstroke .
and an unfortunate disqualiﬁcationf
in the l meter diving event.

The swimmers were mentally psy-
ched and physically ready for this
meet. the first of the championship
season.
records were consistently broken by
most of the swimmers on the team.

The highlight for Albany came at
the end of the meet when Rick

Masom wasawarded the “Most Out-
standing Swimmer“ trophy along
with Buffalo's T. Brenner. Corning
close to hisbest times in three events.
Masom placed first in the two
freestyle sprint events. and then led
the 400 yard freestyle relay team to
victory.
3 In the 50 yard freestyle he took
“1 command ofthe'rac‘eright from the
start and finished three quarters of a
body length ahead of the field. A
' considerable margin for such a short
| z“ race. In the I00 a snappy third turn
put him ahead of Buffalo‘s star
swimmer for the first place. His
defeat of the same swimmer in the
first leg of the 400 yard freestyle relay
.. . seemed to inspire the rest ofthe relay
 . to their winning performance. The
fact that the award was given to an
Albany and a Buffalo‘ swimmer
- -I seemed to reflect the even level of
performance between the two teams.

The overall quality performance
began with the first race. the medley
relay.
backstroke leg. improving upon his
personal best by two seconds.
Seidcnbcrg swam the breastroke leg.
He was unable to catch Stony Brook
and Buffalo swimmers. who had
gotten a large lead from their strong
backstrokcrs. Mitch Rubin wasable
to catch the Stony Brook team with It

that he had set. After securinga one

The next race was the 50 yard
freestyle in which Albany wasable to
place three swimmers. Masom took
the first. Mike,VoIpe placed fourth.
and freshman Mark .Iaffe swam his
personal best time to pull an upset
for fifth place.

In the 200 yard Individualmedlcy
Dun Dudley and Ben Sicbccker both
turned in strong performances to
place 2nd and 3rd respectively.

Art Rosenberg would have taken
fourth in the l meter diving if it
wasn‘t fora technicality. Two of his
dives were discounted. thus pulling
him down to eighth place.

Mitch Rubin was in good form in
the 200 yard butterﬂy. placing sc-
cond with a timeof2:l2.0. tying his
personal best and putting him only
two tenthsofa second away from the
longest standing school record.
