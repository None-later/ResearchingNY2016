nineteenth century architect Henry '

._ icha‘rdson. Through a walking
tour sponsored by the museum last
Friday. the works of this architect
were closely examined. _

Richardson must represent an
area of major interest to many
Albany area citizens as more than 50
people could not beaccommodated
in this tour which only had space for
I40 perso_ns._ .He was the designer of
twii of the city's most important
buildings. the State Capitol and City
Hall. -

'The tour began with an inspection
of these blueprints and sketches.
Asidglrom viewing the evolution of
the design of the Capitol. the Trinity
Church; which according to many
critics was Richardson’s greatest
achievement. was on display. The
church. built in Cambridge with its
elaborate Spanish Romanesque
details is shown in various stages of
its development. The original plans
of the Richardson concept for a
railroad station are also on View.
Many of these stations still adorn the
Albany-Boston area. According to
Jahn Mesick. the tour guide and
architect from the Albany area. these
railroad stations were the inspiration
for Frank Lloyd Wright‘s develop-
ment of “prairie architecture."

‘ it. ill. Richardson, an'Ameriean

citizen, returned from an extended

tvlsit to France at the, close ofg'the .

Civil War. :He saw muehjeonfiision
in architecture and felt that it was his
mission to bring order out of the ex-
isting chaos. He copied the
Romanesque period of architecture
(9004100 AD.) and his buildings all
shared Spanish- and Southern
French detail. Richardson used the
principle of great arches which he

' claimed dccla red to the people “enter

me here.“ ,

The architect was a staunc
believer that any building he design-
ed should take its shape from the ac-
tivity that went on inside. He said he
would undertake’any assignment
from that of a chicken coop to a
cathedral. His creations were
not nearly thatdiverse. ranging from
small private residences to criminal
prisons.

dards the Capitol building and City
Hall are by no means innovative. at
the time they were built they

An idea constantly recurring in
Richardson‘s work was a sense of
catering to the insides of a building.

design of the outside structures. ‘

Leaving the institute. the tour led
the participants to a luncheon
specially prepared at the recent
LegislativeOff ice Building. The effect
of this building is of bleu cheese. as
the major material used in construc-
tion was marble. its sleek
appearance made an extreme con-
trast with Richardson's Capitol
building viewed in the distance.

Lunch was perhaps the most in-
teresting and unusual part of the
walking tour. Most of the par-
ticipants were middle-aged women.

end. Mcsick commented not on
Richardson but on our own “belov-
ed" campus. He reacted negatively
to the architectural design stating"
that it (the design) was a sad com-
mentary on what parents and es-
pecially politicians expected of
education.

As the entourage slowly crept
towards the Capitol building after
the luncheon l was well on the way
to establishing good public relations
with several of the women museum
members. They went so far asto en-
courage mc to purchase my own
membership to the institute. By this
time. they had a better impressionist
a SUNYA student and some of the
initial stuffiness i had
observed in their attitudes had
vanished.

Armed with insight gained from
the morning's look a Richardson's
blueprints and drawings of the
Capitol several observations could
be made. if one looked closely at the
building the changc invarchitectural
styles could be detected. Richardson
and Leopold Eidlitz. another
architect. took over the Capital‘s
construction after the resignation of
the first architect. Fuller. They com-
promised with the half CtlllSll‘tlciL‘d

ed Romanesque features to the
building. The lower three iloors are

whih- the fourth floor represents a
transitional compromise and the
fifth is mainly of Romanesque

Richardson was the designer 01 the

or "Million dollar" staircase which
has four sidcson every level. The in-

teriors of the Capitol are overly or- .

nate. heavily decorated and conjure
up the image of a mausoleum.

The project of building the
Capitol as Richardson and Eidlitz
designed it took thirty years and ex-
penses were six times over the
amount alloted it in its original
budget. The two architects originally

building but they were overruled by
those who claimed the structure

Self-Directed Tour

A privileged visit to the Lieute-
nant Governor‘s quarters was
granted as a part of the walking tour.
Here one could examine closely a
clock that Richardson designed. It
was the most impressive piece of
work in the Capitol. being the only
thing not overdone and
overembcllished.

City Hall is not as maudlin and

overdone as the Capitol building.
The budget for it had been even
tighter and in designing this struc-
ture, Richardson was unable to
devote as much eff or to the internal
design.

The walking tour of II. H.
Richardson‘s Albany was an in-
teresting experience but one that
anybody can virtually duplicate for
himself. The Capitol building olfers
its own tours all the little and the
pamphlets they hand out are llltthiY

most unusual and entertaining purl
of the day was meeting some ol the
Albany citizenry. It is almost tul-
mirable to see the devotion that they
feel for their area. Their main
message was repeated again and
again. Albany does have history and

,Up until a few weeks ago, Santa
Fe Swing" was an unheard of term
everywhere except between Albu-
querque and Denver. Now. after a
record breakingconcert at Skidmore
College. a smashing weekend at
Caffe Lena in Saratoga. a
triumphant and highly praised per-
formance at Northeastern Universi-
ty in Boston. and an up-and-coming
weekend engagetnent at SUNYA‘s
own Freeze-Dried Coffeehouse. it is

indeed‘an understatementto say that
“Santa Fe Swing" has become pop-

ularly accepted as a unique and ex-

citing musical contribution.

This new sound. and its
perpetrators. a foursome collectively
known as Don Armstrong's Siver
Lining. are taking the East by storm.
They make their Albany premiere at
the Freeze-Dried Coffeehouse
tonight and tomorrow night in

Roxy Music Macks Everything

bySpencer Reggie and Matt Kauf-
nun

Roxy Music is decadent. That‘s
one critieiun that has often been
levelled at Bryan ferry's group. but in
the wake of the Velvet Underground
and Lou Reed—especially his Berlin

palbum. a deﬁnitive statement on
decadence if one ever existed. “Roxy
is decadent” just doesn‘t hold up.
British art/rock maybe. but does
that really mean anything‘!
lncongruity is the key word to
Roxy‘s success. If they must be link-
ed with art. Ferry might be called the
chc' Magritte of music. Objects
and aspects of rock that normally
have no business with each other
come together in Roxy Musicas they
do in Magritte. and it‘s all a part of
the process of mocking everything
they do. (Even their album covers
are parodies of the supposedly
provocative covers of Muzak
bands.)

They‘re strong imaginative well—
executed rock. but Roxy‘s bite is in
its lyrics. Ferry sings words that
usually do not mean much of
anything yet he manages. through

phrasing. tone and his strangely
affected voice. to lend ovenones to
the song that do not seem to derive
from the song itself.

In performance. as they

demonstrated last Friday at the.

Academy. Roxy augments their
music with more of the some visual-
ly. Five musicians walk onstage. pick
up their instruments and begin to
play. Nothing unusual in that. Then
a man dressed in adark conservative
business suit and short slick hair
wanders in from the back of the
stage. snapping his ﬁngers and dan-
cing awkwardly to the music. What
the hell is Howard Stein doing out
there? But he walks over to a
microphone and out comes the un-
mistakable voice of Bryan Ferry. He
ﬁnished the concert in this fashion.
his clothing and stage actions as
stiltcd and affected and unnatural as

. his voice.

They played a sizeable portion of
their new release. Country Life.
along with several songs from each
of their three previous albums“

Roxy is good. Eddie Jobson.
Andy Mackay. Paul Thompson

an excellent musical foundation.
There are more than enough good
bands. though. What makes Roxy
Music stand out is the new outlooks.
the new interpretations they bringto
their music and to rock in general—
.10 matter how foolish or ridiculous
people may think them. Take it alias
a gimmick. take it as art/rock or
decadence. it doesn‘t really matteral
long as you don't take it too serious-

ly.

Babe Ruth opened Roxy‘s show;
their billing as “British Musical
Wizards“ turned out to be almost as
big a joke tts their performance. But
what can you expect from a group
with a white body-suited female
singer who aims for Janis Joplin and
lands somewhere in the vicinity of
iuri Quatro‘! They were partially
