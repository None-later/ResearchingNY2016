i Practical Lessons

Most of the SA officials at SUC- Brockport have resigned. They built up enormous
gasoline bills on thier own cars and on their student government‘s (880, or Brockport
Student Government) two vans. One ofﬁcial used the 350 credit card for a five
hundred dollar engine overhaul. Other discrepencies were discovered also and the
entire case has been turned over to the New York State -Police Bureau of Criminal
investigation.

Corruption is not foreign to SUNYA. Last year’s Director of the Campus Center
was indicted for finding ways for money to enter his pockets in amounts that have been
estimated at a twenty thousand dollar minimum. A head cashier oVer at FSA was able
to funnel money into his pocket earlier this year in the same manner. The university.
like all other institutions in America, has no reliable wayto avoid this because some
corruption (often referred to euphemistieally as “benefits“) is expected.

What has happened at Brockport has some practical lessons to teach us. Elected
student officials cannot be trusted,just as most other bureaucrats and officials cannot
be. and if students want to protect their yearly sixty-fourdollars in tax payments they‘ll
haveito institute strict guidelinesforthe use of that money. Here at Albanya number of
sophisticated ﬁnancial procedures have been instituted in recent years for efficiency
and to prevent misuse. These procedures did not stop some of last year‘s SA officials
from obtaining free tickets. free meals (charged to SA). and making other questionable
expenditures of SA money. This year's SA President Pat Curran is the antithesis of
corruption, and regularly refuses even the most trivial form of graft. But Pat Currans
I are few and far between. which is the point.

Price of Success

Events at the State University College at Brockport are reminders that students are
no exception to the pervasive current of corruption in American society. Watergate.
rather than eliminating unethical practices in business and government. may haVc
simply institutionalized them. if it goes on at the highest levels of the federal
government. how could it ever surprise its at any other level.

Solutions are being tried. but they are analagous to draining a swamp by drinking
the water: You become heavy, feel crummy.get sick.and then it rains and you're back
where you started. For every white collar criminalbrought to trial. there are thousands
who continue not only without being caught. but without seeing themselves as being
guilty. it would be much easier to list those skimming offthctop than those who aren't
taking graft simply because it would be a real project to find an honest person.

Kenneth B. Clark of CUNY said in the New York Times recently that American
society has accepted dishonesty as the price of success. and that “when dishonesty
appears to work. it is difficult to argue persuasively for honesty" Corruption is so
prevalent in the United States that it may indeed be useless toargucagainst it. The only
solution. assuming we want one. would be a complete revolution. a revolution that
might not include violence but probably would.

Pan American airlines could very quickly
go from the rcd to the black if they would only

Kissinger has recently returned from yet
another trip to the M iddlc Fast. This tour was
considered to be one of a fact-finding nature.
sccing first litittd where the President of ligypt
and the Prime Minister of lsrttcl stand on a
second stage disengagement agreement.

Egypt. at this stage. is looking for more
concessions from the Israelis iii the Sinai
Peninsula: rclinquishmcnt of the strategic
Mitla and (iidi passesnts well asabtindonment
of the Abti Rliutlcis oil wells in the southwest
Sinai. which afford isl‘llL‘l ti large margin of
petroleum self-sufficiency.

What is Israel looking for? Among other
things they are seeking. an tigrccmcntof non-
bclligcrency between the two states an. and
rights of passage through the revitalized Suez
Canal. lsracl‘s commercitil'future rests to a
large extent with the second issue. it would
mean alot to an already hurting Israeli
economy if goods bound for their country
could move through the canal instetid of
having to take it much longer route. The
Secretary of State is prepared to return this
Friday for another round of serious
negotiations hcthcn the two nations.

At this juncture President Sadat can very
seriously be considered the key linchpin in the
intricate framework of a Middle East peace
He is it major determinant of where the chips
Wlll fall. He can lean in favor ol'tlicAmericitnis
and he cttn'lcan in favor of peace. each of
which have u potentially more optimistic
outcome than it he tilts the other way.

Sadat hits said that “the Russians can give
you arms. but only the United States can give
you a solution." He knows that the Soviets
