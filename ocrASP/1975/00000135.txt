III which a dry tickla'cllaugao into blatant reality

I Ind clips at your aoiar plexuar A fourth attempt at quitting

by Nancy Gray
don't remember when I
 decided that 13 years was the
age to start, but somehow I
must have made thatdecision because
on my 13th birthday, I fit my first
aigarette feeling fully justified that I
had waited the prescribed time. All we
ever heard bad about cigarettes back
then in the 50's was that they stunted
your growth. No one, of course,
believed it, all of us having uncles who
smoked towering over six feet. We felt
they just told us that because they
didn't want us to grow up. We knew
they preferred us as children because
we we're easier to control. Back then,
and in a lot of ways now also, we
equaled adulthood with smoking and
that's precisely the reason we started.

It was also very important to be good
at smoking and to achieve at least a
pack a day. We all practiced in front of
mirrors. We nevergot the tip wet (filters
were rare then), never held it in the
middle of our mouths, always to one
side. lgot so good I could hold it in my
mouth while talking, squinting my eye
so the smoke wouldn't irritate. By the
time I reached a pack aday (hard to do
when one has to spend live hours in
school where no smoking is allowed),
my parents had lost any authority over
me. After all, I reasoned, who are they
to tell me. We are all adults now, we all
smoke. It is my conclusion that no
matter what people say, most of them
started smoking to achieve adult status
and that's the pity of it. Now we've
teamed if can cause cancer, heart
disease, emphysema and who knows
what else. That's a whole lot more than
we bargained for when all we wanted
to do was grow up.

This is my lourth attempt to quit
smoking. l think I'll make it this time.
For one thing, I can't remember how
long it's been since lguit. (tn the past, I
used to know to the hour.) I have since
concluded that counting the days is a
mistake. In order to succeed, I've
decided I must understand that it is
irrelevant how long it's been. Ican only

stop smoking once. I can pause, rest,
cut down many times, but only stop
once. If I am counting the days, then
quitting is a continuous thing, not
something already accomplished. lf 1
have truly stopped smoking and

' someone offers me a cigarette, l'd say

"No thanks, Idon't smoke." Otherwise
l'd say, "Not now, maybe later."

Two years ago in Colorado I had
bronchitis. It was a month of that most
horrible of throat things, the
unreachable dry tickle. I couldn't do
two cigarettes a day without coughing
till my eyes feared. When I was finally
well, I tried to quit the third time. My
husband and l decided to try the
buddy system developed by
Alcoholics Anonymous. Working
together, we "paused" for about six
weeks. Then he had to go out of town
on a job for three months. That took
care of that for both of us.

Now some people say you can't half-
way it. I don't agree. l think it must be
harder for someone who does two
packs a day to quit than someone who
does two or three packs a week. l am
convinced one can work out a
program of gradual withdrawal so that
when one takes the final plunge, it's not
so severe. I am reinforced in this belief
by an interview l saw of Katharine
Hepbum in which she related how she
quit smoking by cutting down day by
day. It was a deliberate, diSCipliried
effort on her part and it worked.

After the Colorado failure, I never
quite reached a pack a day. l noticed
(and l'm sure all you smokers out there
know the feeling) that if I did over a
pack a day, my throat would burn and l
would wake up the following morning
feeling like my fat mother was sitting
on my chest. Now who wants to feel like
that for an eye-opener? To what
purpose~you can't even get high on
the stuff.

I decided to cut down little by little.
Every day, l'd add 15 minutes or more
to the time lwaited for my first cigarette
of the morning. I would not allow
myself more than one smoke per
hour.ln just three or four months I got
down to three or four packs a week.
Hours would go by without even a
craving. I remained at that level for
over a year. Now even the Cancer
Society would be happy With that. lwas
pretty satisfied with it myself, but not
my husband. He had quit by himself
some months before and like some
reformed crusader, he badgered. My
daughter badgered. "l mind if you
smoke/she'd nag.

Oh, l heard all the arguments . . . . all
the latest statistics from the cancer and
heart people. They would appeal to my
intelligence, my sense of logic, rriy love
for them, anything they could rise. lt
was getting more and more difficult
standing my ground knowing full well]
was wrong. Moreover, and what l
couldn'tadmit to them, my throat never
really stopped hurting since that timel
was sick in Colorado. t dared not tell

them that it was always sore, that 1 was
beginning to be afraid myself. A throat
is not supposed to hurt constantly, I
know that for sure.

1 think of myself as practical, logical
and realistic. "What," I would ask
myself, 'do I get from smoking? It
doesn't speed me up, slow me down or
improve my appetite. (1 am CtUlle
skinny and always working on gaining
weight.) It doesn't bring me down or
even get me high as a kite. The worst
chemical on the whole drug scene has
a better record on that score. Yet, I
would think about quitting and a cold,
deadly feeling would emerge right
around the area of my solar plexus. I'm
sure you know it; a tighttistgrabbing at
you, forcing you to back down.

Until recently, l believed that if I
could figure out the reason for that
feeling of fear, the psychological basis
for my smoking would become clear
and l would thereby be cured. I still
don't have the answer to that one. My
throat couldn't wait. l knew the time
had come to stop now and if 1 had time
later, l could ponder on the whys of it.
Anyway, l had to admit to myself the
only probable reason I was a smoker is
l started at l3 to be a grown—up. lam
iiiurndated With proof of my adulthood
now, responsrbilities, motherhood, etc.
l truly don't need cigarettes to assure
myself that I am no longer a child.

Now ldo not smoke. I need two hours
less sleep per night and wake up as
refreshed as ldid when l was a kid. I
hop out of bed ready to go even after
staying up late the night before. They
say things taste and smell better, l'm
not really sure. I do know that l have
more energy than I've had in years and
that's the part l like best.

[am asking every smoker who has
nevertri'ed to quit, who has neverspent
a few days Without a cigarette since he
or she started smoking, to try it. If
you've been smoking a year or twenty
years Without a break, try it. I am not
asking you to quit, only to try to go
without it for a few days. Feel the
withdrawal symptoms, (they're
lmPOSSlble tOdescribe).Notice how the
desire for a cigarette creeps up on you
when you least expect it. lritroduce
yourself to the fist clutching at your
solar plexus. Then, after the few days
have passed, light one up.

Remember the first crgurotle you
ever smoked? You probably got dizzy

Alcoholism on the  day

by John Ghrist

ith a downturn in the use of
drugs like LSD,
amphetamines and even

marijuana, many young people across
the nation have returned to another'
drug that was number one all along:
alcohol.

And what's more, many of them are
getting farther into the liquid drug than
they ever did with other drugs. The
result is a serious and growing
problem of young alcoholics.

Last month, the university launched
a task force on alcohol education to
develop an educational package
about the dmg for use on campus. One
of the first in the country, thegrouphas
found that most alcohol educational
material is aimed at older drinkers.

‘ health centers are often ill-equipped to

EVOLUTION OF A DRUNK
According to treatment experts,
there are two stages in the
development of alcoholism. The first is
psychological: a preoccupation with
liquor, a personality change, gulping
or doubling drinks and an increase in
tolerance. The second, physical stage -
occurs when the disease has
progressed over a period of time.
Symptoms can include blackouts,
ulcers and liver or kidney damage.
For those who suspect they may be
slipping into an alcohol problem, the
National lnstitute on Alcohol Abuse
itlt<'l Alcoholism hasa ten question test;
1) Do you think and talk about
drinking often? '2.) Do you drink more
than you used to? 3) Do you sometimes
gulp drinks? 4) Do you often take a
drink to help you relax? 5) Do you
drink whim you itl't’ alone? 6) Do you

inemberswho attend regularly, but the
liotline has received many tithtt’teS
from people worried about the amount
of alcohol they are consuming.

Finally, the university has stopped
requmng that its remdent assistants
report for disciplinary action any
student drinking in the dormitories.

Rather than turning in friends who
were engaged in a very common
actrvrty, many RAs took no action at all.
Now, discrplinay action takes a back
seat to counselling and RAs are
empowered to take certain personal
actions if they feel someone is over-
usirig alcohol.

At UCLA, a program has been
established called Student Health
Advocates. The student advocates are
trained to deal Will'i minor health
problems. They do counselling,
dispense aspirin and cough medicine,
rill(l encourage those Wllll alcohol
