A Rich Man’
‘ Justice

by Paul Warkow
and Howard Wittlin
' here are advantages to our
' school being located in the
' state's capital. One is theCourt
of Appeals, the highest court in the
land. TheCourtof Appeals is in session
for two weeks each year. This year it
was open from Monday, February 10th
to Friday, February 21 st, each day from
two to six in the afternoon.

On Monday February 10th I took the
bus down to Draper and then walked
down Washington Avenue to the court
house. It is located across the street
from the State Legislature and in
between the two buildings is a statue of
General Schuyler. The court house isa
large white dome building with old
Greek columns in front.

I entered through the revolving
doors and was stopped by a guard.
Guard: Where are you going?

Myself: Just to listen in on the court
proceedings. Aren't visitors allowed?
Guard: Not like that. You can't go in
like that There is a dress code. You
must wear a tie and a jacket.

Myself: A tie and a jacket. You gottabe
kidding.

Before I knew it I was standing in
front of the court's head clerk, Mr.
Stennard.

Stennard: I'm sorry butwe have a dress
code here. I tied my scarf into a tie.

Myself: How's that?
Stennard: I'm sorry it won’t do. You'll
have to wear a jacket, a tie—and dress
pants. No dungarees or workshoes.

Ithink [gave him a good dirty look.
Stennard: I'm sorry. It's not of my
choice. The dress code is vigorously
enforced by Chief Justice Britel.
Myself: Can l see the code?
Stennard: I don't believe it's written
down.
Myself: Well if it isn't written down it
doesn't exist.

But it was too bad for me; I was
barred entrance.

How fair is this? I happen neither to
own a tie ora pairof dress pants. A rich

.man’s justice—everyone has to wear
ties and suits? Are the courts reserved ’

only for the rich? A tie! Sometimes

even Judd on ‘Judd for the Defense'
didn't wear a tie.

Now who decides proper dress. The
judge? lf Justice Britel wore leotards
like Superman, would we all have to

 

 

 

' unsuccessfully

dress in leotards? I wonder if I came
dressed like George Washington if I'd
be bared entrance. Don‘t worry, Ionly
wondered, I never came that way.

On Wednesday, February 12th I
tried againFThis time I borrowed a tie
and wore a sweater that had buttons
down the middle, as a jacket.

I was allowed entrance. What I found
was not as impressive as I expected.
There was one medium sized room (55
256), everything was in intricately
carved wood: the ceiling, the floor, the
desks and chairs. The walls were lined
with paint portraits of past judges. The
seven judges sat in frontof the lawyer's
desks. In the back was forty chairs for
visitors. The only people there were the
seven judges and the lawyers whdhad
approachedthe plea desk. I was the
only visitor.

Judge Britel sat in the middle, calling
the cases and doing most of the
questioning. At the far left sat Judge
Fuchsberg who ran unsuccessfully
against Justice Britel two years age.
The only one not wearing glasses was
Judge Wachtler from Nassau County.
For those who were in Professor
lohnpoll's Political Science 101 last
term, in the movie Wachtler was the
Machiavaltean schemer who ran
against Eugene
Nickerson for Nassau County
Executive in 1967.

Most of the pleas by the lawyers
were dry and unemotional, the
language was very technical. Only
one lawyer showed any humaness.
Looking upat the end of his plea at the
seven dry faces he apologized for

 

“YOU‘RE tN FOR MURDER? FUNNV, I’M IN FOR REFtJStNGTO!”

 

 

 

 

 

being emotional; “it was just that I'm so
sincere in my cause.’ The judge
laughed and Britel said, "Never put
veracity and sincerity at issue.” Give
the judge a cookie.

There was one interesting case. This
involved the system of assessing land
in New York. Instead of assessing land
by its full value, it is assessed at its
fractional value. The plaintiff in this
case argued two points: 1) The
assessors gave the value using
fractional assessment. This caused the
man to pay excess taxes. 2) The
fractional system is unfair and
impractical because it is hard to
determine the fractional value of land
and different states use different
fractions, so you need special
conversion charts. The court might
decide that you must assess land at its
full value.The only question is, how do
you determine full value?

Because the Court of Appeals does
not involve a jury and the questioning
of witnesses, it is not as exciting as a
trial court. Yet it is still a worthwhile
experience. All the more reason since
it's only in session two weeks
throughout the whole year. I believe it
would n't be the worst idea to go down
to the Court of Appeals at least once
during one of your four years at
Albany.

And wear a lie,

consumption. We feel sorry for the
cook who gets spasms in his arm when
he attempts to season the food. On the
other hand, when the food is bland, we
cannot even find any salt to spice it up.

Now it in utility sauce time. Com'eon,
you know what utility sauce is. Itcan be _
disguised as many different things. ,
Utility sauce is the gravy on the beef, 
chicken, fish, lamb, pork, and probably: ‘ '
spaghetti. The color and consistency
can be varied by the addition of flour- ’
and dye. Thin utility sauce is soup and ;

jello, while thick utility sauce doubles  I

as gravy and pudding. Utility sauce is
almost always overseasoned enough .
to ulcerate lb strongest of stomachs. '

What we are trying to say, is that the I
food is damn poor. How can F.S.A.
justify an eight percent increase in the -
cost of board when they 'cannot
provide adequate board now. This
increase will not increase the quality of
the food, just keep at its present level.
Any increase in the cost of board
should be preceded by an increase in
quality. We think that most students
would be willing to pay a fifteen
percent increase if the food would take
on a more appetizing quality.

In conclusion, due to the
aforementioned conditions, "Ptomaine
Tavern" was voted the most feared
place to be at mealtime, by the humble
Colonial Quad inhabitants.

Last week an article appeared in the
ASP explaining how the organic
wastes from the quads are processed
on Fuller Road. The compost is then
used as a soil enricheron campus. This
is an attempt to stop erosion.

So, what it comes down to is quite
bétStC. Either wayv‘we lose. If we keep
throwmg out tons of food, the prices
Will probably rise. If we are careful not
to waste anything the university will be
washed away.
