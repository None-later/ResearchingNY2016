The Albany State Great Dane
basketball team closed out their
in unconvincing
form, as they defeated a vastly in-

‘ ‘ferior Stony Brook team. 82-70.

Saturday evening.

‘ For the Danes it was their second
poor'performance since receiving
their NCAA bid. Like the Marist
game, Albany just could not get
"psyched" for the contest. With a bid
in their pocket plus. the fact that
Stony Brook was 2-2l . the team was

ing under .500 ball on the road (6-7).

Judging from the Brockport~ game.
Albany can take the heat. Their en—
tire season was on the line and the
Danes responded withl fury. The
team exhibited great poise. refusing
to fold. even when Albany fell
behind late in the contest.

To be able to win the tournament,
thought. Albany must perform like
they 'did against Brockport and Buf-
falo State. it is going to takea com-
plete team effort. Much of the
pressure will fall on the Dunes‘
forwards. Albany's biggest man is
Tom Morphis who goes 6'5”. St.
Lawrence has two men that have
that height. while Broekport and
RN have centers who are taller.
Because the Danes have the smnllest
team in‘ the tourtinment. Kooltt.
Morphis. Audi and Keane will have
to work extremely hard under the
boards. boxing out their opponents.
