by rite Aurelius Pie-3
The legislature rushed approval

Wednesday of a $90 'million ap-V'

propriation to keep construction go~
ing at Urban Development Corp.
sites across the state for the next two
months.

The bill was designed to give the
state time to ﬁnd private sources of
capital to complete UDC‘s housing
and commercial construction
program on a longterm basis. And
some legisbstors expressed the hope
privately that the appropriation
would serve as the “gesture of good
faith" some major banks have said
they wanted before getting involved
again with UDC constntction.

The legislation guaranteed at least
a temporary lull in the UDC crisis
which has transﬁxed state govern-
ment since last fall. when ll major
“clearing house” banks served notice
that they considered the UDC a risky
investmentand would no longerhelp
market its bonds unless changes
were made.

The Senate approved the ap-
propriation 39-l9 Wednesday after—

noon, following up on favorable
Assembly action at Mo am. of a
"3334 vote. '

V The scenario was a virtual repeat
of the action one week ago. when the
two houses pushed through a bill
creating a new Project Finance
Agency. Gov. Carey proposed the
new agency as a vehicle to handle
UDC’s future borrowing. which the
banks would ﬁnd a more attractive
investment than the UDC itself.

The UDC defaulted on Sl35
million in loans last week, and was
stripped of virtually all of its cash
resources late Friday afternoon
when banks seized money in UDC
accounts to hold against those loans.
The banks have agreed not to make
any such seizures in the future
without giving at least ﬁve days‘
notice. and therefore the $90 million
will be channeled directly to con-
struction.

Without funds, construction at
U DC project sites would have ended
this week —a step U DC officials had
said would probably lead to massive
vandalism the theft at the sites.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

MARCH 7, 1975

 

by Edward Maser

The building of an Alumni House
is currently taking place in a clearing
on Perimeter Road near Dutch
Quad. Expected to be finished this
summer. the Alumni House will
feature a unique solar heating
system. .

An outgrowth of the environmen-
tal and energy conservation
movements. the heating system is
designed to handle both summerand
winter conditions.

in cold weather, the sun‘s rays will
be trapped in plate glass “solar
collectors“, filled with water and
located on an especially long roof.
This water. when heated, will travel
into a number of giant storage tanks
within the building. A pump will‘
remove the heat from the water and
transfer it into the ventilation
system.

Coolhtg Tower

During the hot months. water
from the tanks will be run into a
cooling tower during the early part
of the day. Later. the cooled liquid
could be used in the Alumni House's
air conditioning system.

One might ask what would
happen in the event of a long cold
spell. since the heat pump can only
use waterwarrncr than forty degrees.
The problem would be solved by a
back-up system of metal coils
located in the tanks and heated elec-
trically.

 

 

Even the placement of trees has
been considered in planning the
heating process. The Alumni House
will be surrounded by deciduous ‘
trees. the shadeof which will help to
cool the building in the summer.
Such trees lose their leaves in winter.
and so the building will receive the
full benefit of the sun‘s warmth at a
time when it will need it the most.

‘ln addition. evergreen trees. which
never shed. will be so placed as to
block the prevailing winter winds
from assaulting the House.

The cost of construction is es-
timated at 8175.000. a sum already
raised by alumni contributions. The
solar heating component will cost an
additional 560.000. The campus At-
mospheric Science Center will use
state funds to cover about a third of
this. and the Niagara Mohawk
Power Corporation will makeup the
rest. The Corporation wants to find
out how the cost of solar heating
compares with more conventional
methods.

Although the primary purpose of
an Alumni House is to serve alumni
interests. the building will also
provide conference space for all Un-
iversity functions.

The Alumni House was to be built
near lndian Quad. but fears that
construction there would pollute the
campus lake. coupled with the ad-
vantage of extra Dutch Quad park-
ing. caused the shift. ‘

 

Finals Issue Remains
Unresolved in Senate

do the best in cramming and staying
awake all night.“

Birnbaum stressed that it is not a
question of students wanting to get
out of school a few days earlier.
rather finals represent the culmina-
tion of an entire semester‘s work.
'l‘ltcrcforc. the scheduling should be
such that students can do as well as
they‘re capable of doing. “not for
some teachers who are worried
about a few of their students missing
a couple of classes in the last Week of
school." He said if students do miss
classes they know they will be at a
disadvantage. but it‘s their own cs-

ponsibility to either make up the
work or suffer from missing it.

As for the student who raised the
question the bill seeks to rectify.
Senate member Kcu Wax (student)
doubts if one student represents the
will of every student.

The issue will not hcagain discuss-
ed until the next University Senate
meeting which will be in Aprilaftcr
vacation. Mcanwhilc Ira llirubaum
asks any student who Would prefer
to take all five ﬁnals in one week" to
let him know. Attd Dr. Tompkins

PIRG Launches Lobbying Effort

by Linda Fried
Albany PIRG. the SUNYA
branch ofa istatewidc organization

instituted by Ralph Nader in 1971.

held a monthly general interest
meeting last Monday. During this
meeting, committee Chairpersons
summarized current projects and
outlined future goals and plans.
.Most recently initiated is the
Albany Legislative Program. design-
cd to organize a massive school lob-
bying effort. This will be pyramidal
in structure. The person in charge
can contact various sub-leaders. who
will instruct their group members as
to which issues to write lettersabout.
and to whom they should write.
When a legislator is bombarded
with hundreds of letters, he will un-
doubtedly bc spurred to action.
Moreover. should one thousand
people in each of the twelve NYP-
lRG schools involve themselves. the
power of sheer numbers would have
a staggering effect. Politicians. con-
cerned as they are with reelection.
are greatly influenced by public opi-
nion.
General Awareness
Another function of this project is
a general awareness program to
fa miliari/e students with their
legislators. A student fills out a form
at the i’lRG desk in thc campus
center. and volunteers find the infor-

mation for that district. if the stu-
dent wishes. he may also have a
profile pamphlet for his district
ordered. This pamphlet contains a
briefbiography ofthelegislatorsand
their summarized voting records.
l’lRG is also doingn study of the
Albany taxi service. Students have
been analyzing the laws and working
out ambiguities. Once solid
definitions are made. they will be
brought to the City Council of
Albany in an effort to put an end to
discrepencies in taxi fares.
Food Prices Studied

Supermarket prices are also
presently under investigation. Many
stores in the Albany area received
extensions from the Unit Pricing
Law. exempting them for varying
periods oftimc. PIRG members are
surveying the stores to find the
degree to which the law is being
followed. what items are listed. and
iftltcy have been done correctly. The
committee plans to work out
guidelines for caforccmcnt of the
law. Supplementing this. a study of
gas and food prices found in the urcri
will be released to the public at a
later date.

The cquitahilily of the Albany
Property Tax is being researched by
still another committee. This pro-
ject. fashioned after one undertaken
in Troy. will be a comparison ofthe

market value of homes sold in
Albany last year with their assessed
value. In addition. PIRG will collect
data on the percentage and wonh of
tax exempt property in Albany. A
new project that will also help con-
sumers to get fair housing deals has
recently been started. Working with
the United Tenants of Albany and
the Albany Students‘ Co-op. PRO
is publishing a Complaint Guide of
student housing rights.

One committee is preparing a
guide to free legal services in Albany.
This guide. modeled after one done
by a PIRG group in New York City.
will supply the names of various
organirations. how they can be
reached. and what services they
provide. in addition. Albany PIRG
will take part in the nationwide
Nader effort researching nuclear
power plants. Filmsand information
will be presented on the subject.
along with a teach-in sometime in
April. Featured will be speakers
both for and against the issue.

The prescription drug industry is
also under l’lRG scrutiny. I’rescnt
laws require that there may be no
substitution fortlic brand uamcdrug
prescribed by a doctor. regardless of
the fact that thc same drug by a
different name may be more inex-
pcnsivc. It is hoped that this and
other laws may be repealed.
