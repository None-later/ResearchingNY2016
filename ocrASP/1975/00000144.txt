 WSUA FM?

 

 

Though there has been no enormous change in the forniat, style, orcontentof the SA
funded on-campus radio station ,WSUA, this semester has seen a vast increase in close
scrutiny of and concern about it.

There is nothing new about the complaints. The signal is still carried by wire to
transmitters only on the five quads which means WSUA is a “carrier current“ station.
As such it is easily inﬂuenced by other electrical currents, flourescent lamps, and the
like. Because 'of this there is a buzz in many places which varies in pitch and intensity
but surely interferes with listening. especially on lndian Quad where the buzz is
continuous and rather loud in some rooms. (Thus, their new slogan: “WSUA . . . it
keeps you listening in spite of the buzzj‘) Therelare problems with the transmitters, one
oneachof the We quads, that are old and sometimes break down. Parts of the campus

can never receive WSUA. The station was off the air for over a week earlier in the -

semester due to malfunctioning transmitters. And of course WSUA is not stereo, often
an essential requirement for the sophisticated American music lover.

And there are complaints about music, programming,and announcers but when the
mechanical problems are ignored these complaints are nothing unusual for any radio
station anywhere in the country.

SA's Central Council has a committee. chaired by Rick Meckler of Dutch Quad,
that is looking into WSUA. They are waiting for results of a poll that has been
conducted through thisnewspaper. results that will at least give the committee an idea
of how much the station is being listened to and the reasons why it is not listened to
more. They will then send some kindof recommendations to Central Council which
might suggest simply waiting for the station to go FM, cutting its budget. or,
conceivably, eliminating it altogether.
5 The discussion going on around the campus and in the WSU A committee should be
seen in context, however. It is not a simple case of a $20,000 budget being used to make
only two hundred people happy (surely a conservative estimate). An FM station on this
campus. especially if it is stereo FM, has amazing possibilities for student
involvement, entertainment and education. It could reach thousands of Albany
residents. and all SUNYA students. And weakening the present station is precisely the
thing to do if one wants to keep it from going FM.

Some judgements will have to be made. A large monetary investment has already
gone into the station. many students are receiving invaluable experience by working
for it, some students are enjoying listening to it, and some kind of investment will be
necessary if there istobe any hope for going FM. At the same time these advantages and
the possibility, of FM must be weighed against the continued expense of student tax
money to keep the stationgoing at the present Ievel.which might not be worth doing
very long.

The key issue in determining all this is the lengthof time that it will take for the station
to get an FM liscence. And the answer is unknown. For the WSUA staff, or the FCC,
or Mr. Squatriglia, the Assistant to the Dean of Student Affairs who is advising the
station, or. FM Associates, a company recently employed by WSUA which specializes
in helping campus radio stations go FM, it is impossible to predict when the
application will be processed. The Federal Communications Commission is not
consistent in its behavior in these matters, and asking for a firm date from WSUA is
simply unfair.

But Central Council will still have to make a decision even ifthat decision is to wait-
and-see. It is hoped that they will consider all the facts and all the possibilities, and that
they will come to an intelligent conclusion.

Errata

In an editorial Tuesday it was said that the former Director of the Campus Center
was indicted. This was incorrect; it was the former Assistant Director Thomas
Wilhelm who has been indicted.

War on Crime Grinding Down

 

Richard M. Nixon‘s War on Crime. much
like his predecessor‘s War on Poverty. has‘
failed to stand the test of time.

Both wars had similar strategies: drown the
enemy in money. Each had a clear—cut
purpose. Johnson sought to please
Democratic liberals. while Nixon went after
Middle America. Only the rhetoric was
different, with Nixon appealing to our fears
rather than our hopes.

'l‘hc Nixon domestic war machine in the late
l960's and early 1970‘s developed
characteristics which would have been comic
Were the stakes not so high. As they did during
the war on poverty. state and local
governments soon realized thttt {aidcpthlcss.
brciidthlcss treasure chest of federal funds was
ltI their disposal, in this case to “ﬁghterimc”.

For several years it Wits deemed political
bari-kari to question the wisdom of this
funding. No politician from Bcllti Abzug to
Ronald Reagan wanted to bc“softon crime".

But now. there have been twa little-noticed
indications that the War on Crime. at least as
we have known it, may be coming to anend.

CrIme agencies like the Law Enforcement'
Assistance Administration will suffer overall'
budget cuts of up to l2 per cent in the Ford
proposal.

The second indication comes from a
Government Accounting Office report on the
$30 million Justice Department Pilot Cities
Program (reminiscent of L.B..|.'s ModelCitics
Program). Started in l970und designed to last
live years. the Pilot Cities Program pumped
money into eight cities in an effort to develop
new ‘und more effective crime-ﬁghting
techniques. The 0A0 study found that

nothing useful ever emerged. prompting
Justice to phase out the program curly. lctitttig

Perhaps we are maturing to the conclusion
that social ills are not conquered by liyc-ycttr
blitzkrieg attacks or cured by illlhiliji'
conceived, massive injections of l'edcriil tundi.

In fact. they are never completely
conquered or cured at all. but we lllc lciirtttttg
that they ‘can be minimized through
enlightened policies and responsible hpt‘lltilng

The telephone jangled three sharp bursts. He woke up and fumbled for the receiver.

"Hello, Bill? Constance. Did I wake you?"

He drew a deep breath. rubbing his eyes. "Ah. well—yer and no. "

"Bill, are you all right?"

"Yeah. I'm ﬁne, Connie." He wondered why he wasn‘t in the bedroom.

" You sound terrible. You haven't run out of pills, have you?"

“I'm ﬁne. Connie. Just a bit drowsy," he said, clearing a place on the kitchen table for his
elbows.

" Why don't you come over Ionighl. I’m having some friends from the ofﬁce. We'll all get

"Bye."

"Bye."

Funny. her voice sounded like it was canned. Like his father’s this morning when Bill had
called him at home and got the answering service. Trying to converse with a recording.

He walked to the bathroom and gitrglcd a shot of Listerinc. He put an empty pill bottle in his
pocket and turned into the kitchen. The refrigerator was empty. He Went into the living room
and opened a window. The sky was overcast. seeping a pale gray illumniation over the city. A

stripped for winter. yet there were no leaves on the sidewalk or in the street. A mailman crossed
the street and climbed the stoop ofthe apartment. Bill stepped into a pair oflotIfers, snatched the
car keys from the table and walked downstairs.

One piece of juttk mail. He tore open the envelope as he walked to the car. A business reply

2. How much sleep do you really need?

3. How does Buekminstcr Fuller manage on 4 hours of sleep a day?
4. Is sleep simply another mode of consciousness?

5. Can you make slccp work for you?

Bill fclt mildly annoyed, as if a familiar travelling salesman had burst into hisapartmcnt without
knocking. The smudgy sky darkened. He stuffed the advertisement in the ashtray and drove
downtown. He found a parking space by the police station and crossed the street to the
drugstore.

Walt was at the cash register behind a pile of pain relievers. “Fill this for me. will ya. Walt?“
The druggist caught the empty bottle in mid-air. They'd been drinking buddies before Walt's
marriage.

“How are you feeling. Bill?“

“OK. I guess.“ Hc examined a carton of aspirin on the counter.

“You're eating quite a lot of this stuff these days.“

“It‘s not dangerous. is it?“

“In moderation. my boy. in moderation. We‘re not as youngas we used to bc.Thc straight and

Bill put the aspirin box back in place. “I‘m going to grab something to eat next door.“

“OK, I‘ll bring the refill ovcr; we‘re closing at live."

"Thanks."

Fat Mary‘s Diner was shabby on the outside and greasy on the inside. Sergeant Riordan was
nursing a cup of coffee at the counter. Bill sat beside him. "How‘s it going, Sarge?"

“Billy Summers “long time no see-«how the hell are ya'l" The policeman shook Bill‘s hand
with enough gusto to convince him they had something in common.

“No bad.“ -/ -

“How‘s the old man?" Riordan was the golf partner-bf‘Bill's father.

“OK.” Bill fidgcted with a pack of Pall Malls. “Cigarette?”

“Not for me. That stufl‘s poison.“

"80‘s that coffee."

“Naw. naw...birds of a different color. a totally different color.“ Fat Mary wobbled over.

“Give me a hamburger. French fries...tInd a salad."

“Anything to drink'!"

“Yeah A-l‘ll have a beer.“

Riordan pushed an ashtray toward him. "So what‘s a young strapper like you doing on a
Saturday night?“

“Going to a party.“

“You lucky sonuvabitch you. I wish I was wearing your shoes."

Fat Mary plunked a beer bottle and glass on the counter. “You stuck in that uniform all

EYup -gotta protect the citizens. We don‘t take Saturday nights off." Walt walked in with the
Ritalin. Bill paid him two dollars as the hamburg wasvdelivered.

‘Got to run, Bill—I‘ll see you.“

“OK. Walt." He rinsed down a capsule with a slug of beer.

“What's that stuff!" Riordan asked.

“My medicine." ' ' i '

“Poison. Taking pills at your age—what the hell's the world coming to?“ Riordan dratned his
cup and put on his cap. "Well, I‘ve got to get back to work. Say hello to your father for me and

spectacl rs resting on a nose as sharp as a can opener. beedy black eyes set under m brows, '

held out a Watchtower at arm's length as if it weree "No Trespuslng" sign. The old men seemed
as surprised as Bill and squinted for agcloser look. ‘Why. Praise the Lord! You're just theman
