West led his King of Hearts, and

stopped to do it little figuring. His
partner‘s opening bid and subse-
quent lead shows a iiolding of seven
hearts hcltded by the missinghonors.

Since South hits no honor cards in
either hctlrts or diamonds. his \‘ttlttcs
must lie in spades and clubs. and
should have it“ the missing Iiiin
cards to justify his bid.
