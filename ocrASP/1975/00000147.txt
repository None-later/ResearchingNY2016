apin’sMutti Media Musical,

by Matt Knut‘mnn'andSpenee high

A new and different form of
musical has opened this week at the
Ethel Barrymore Theatre. in New
York called The Night 'l'httt Mat/c
America Famous. The mttlti-media-
musical (as it is called) is a collage of
songs. written by Harry Chapin. and
visual displays of lights.
choreography. slides. and scenery.
The show's objective is to present to
theaudiencea view of the past fifteen
years of U.S.4 history.

This nouveau style of theatre has
cotne under a great amount of flack
from many theatre critics. In an
attempt to add new I ifc to Broadway.
Chapin‘s endeavors have been termed
egotistie. money grubbing. and jtrsl
plain foolishwa waste of time.
money. and energy. Unfortunately.
many of these descriptions are based
on hearsay. or narrow-mindedness.
they do not envelope the notion that
the motives behind The Night 'I'lrttt

Mat/c America Famous could be
well-intentioncd.

The musical. is a collection of
overtly-eight songs. fourteen in each
ol'the two acts. The songs themselves
refer to unions aspects of life in the
U.S.. as seen by (‘hapitL A standout
is the song "Battleground Bummer."

acting. coordinated use of lighting.
slides. and video cameras projecting
the actors on a screen. The success of
the show depends on the interaction
of these various forms of media—
hence the title “mttlti-mcdia
musical“.

Many of the liroadvay critics
deplore this new format for a
musical. They argue that the show
lacks a plot. or that it's too commer-
cial. the show has been attacked on

its informality and it's lack of-

liroadway pomp and preten-
tiotrsness. ()ne critic said that it
provided Harry :1 chance to involve
his whole family in a Broadway
production (his two brothers and his
father a re in the orchestra).
lit‘crybody seems to be overlooking
the loci that the show is simple. fun.
emotional. personal. witty. and just
plain entertaining. For the Theatre
