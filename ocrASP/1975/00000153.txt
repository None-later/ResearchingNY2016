Commuters

by Mle Pick-Ill

Commute v. 3: (to travel back and
forth regularly) - com-mut-er n. Just
a word to some of us. But to others~
l0.625 on this campus to be exact—
it's a way of life.

Commuters are like
other students. They
get drunk sometimes.
go to movies. and

some even attend classesl But their
lives are still different from those of
an on-campus student. And maybe
we should all be aware of these
differences. Let’s start with the
problems ﬁrst.

For openers. there is the matter of
representation in govemment.There
is only one commuter on the
Supreme Court and only one on the
Budget Committee at last count.
Mike Sakoff. a Central Council
commuter representative. pointed to
the fact and commented. “Mr. [Pat]
Curran's executive branch is mostly
on-campus students. It‘s not propor—
tionate at all!"

Sakoff also feels that the com-
mutcr‘s problems are not being ade-
quately heeded. “Central Council is
insensitive to the needs of the com—
muter." he said. Which brings back
echoes of the old reference to com-
muters: Thc Forgotten People.
Sometimes it just seems that on-
campus people do forch the
members of the traveling communi-
ty. How often are they considered in
student affairs?

[But the blame may lie on all of us.
“The off-campus student is being
screwed by the student body." con—
tinued Sakoff. He cited the Quad
card as a case in point. When a com-
muter buys one for use on a par~
ticular quad. it can be used for event
participation. but carries no voting
rights: in other words it is “taxation
without representation.” Further-
more. "cach on-campus student has
his own quad to fall back on whereas

an off-campus student doesn't "

The poll was conducted from‘a
random sampling of I40 Albany
State students. eighty of whom were
contacted. The rest either had no
phone number registered with the
university. were simply away. or not
available over the survey period. Un-
fortunately. the poll had a deadline
because its WSUA questions were
needed by a Central Council com-
mittee. The ASP plans more polls in
the future with larger and thus more
reliable sample sizes.

The WSUA questions were asked
only of on-campus students. and
showed that while most students do
not listen. their reasons for not
listening more are due to the recep-
tive quality (the $011") and the fact
that they like listening to many
stations rather than because they
don't like the music or announcers
on WSUA.

Find Problems & Pleasure in Off-Campus Life

concluded.

But that's only one big problem
Another is transportation. lt'sa fact
that a commuter with a car—besides
 usual problems of gas and earlier
rising—must face the added burden
of parking in the back of the Dutch
and State Quad parking lots. The
choicer locations are reserved for the
resident students; meaning the com

muters have much farther to walk to '

reach the podium. In the winter. I've
been told. that'sa “long. cold walk.“

0n the other hand. the commuter
who takes the SUNY buses is also a

victim of fate. The last bus leaves the '

uptown campus at l2z40 each night.
forcing the apartment dweller to fit
his schedule around it—or find
another way of getting home. At
night. that may be a difficulty.
Now we come to entertainment.
As you know. most of the student-
sponsored events are held on cam-
pus. Which musns most of the com—
muters are going to miss them. In
fact. the off-campus student must
make an extra effort and usually
must plan well in advance for these
events if they wish to attend them.
But on the other hand. some aren‘t
even aware of what goes on. Tom

Lichodolik. a junior SUNYA com-
muter. speaks for many of his
colleagues when he says. ‘We [the
commuters] don't l‘md out about
most of the events until after they're
over." Just by livingoff campus, he
continues. “we miss out on a lot of
things."

Other disadvantages of the
“traveling student” include food and
friendships. The commuter must buy
his own food. cook it. and (you won't
believe this)WASH HIS OWN DIS-
HES! Really! Whenwas the lasttime
you've done that! ‘ i

But more seriously. there is the
very real problem ofmaking friends.
With off-campus living. people are
much more difﬁcult to Iind because
an obvious effort must be made to
look around. 0n mmpus there

is hardly that problem: most of the
time, you can't get away from friend-
ly people even if you wanted to!

Ken Wax, Central Council

biggest off-campus fan of all. Ken
explained that although he does
have problems. he would not trade
his apartmmt for all the dorms in
China—or SUNYA for that matter.
You get to eat “good food [what‘s
that] and can eat whenever you
wantihe said.

There is also the prospect of get-
ting true privacy in an apartment. If
it gets noisy in thearca. “all you have
to do is shut your door." Another
commuter. Patricia Sweeny. echoes
that feeling of privacy; “It‘s so much
quieter.“ she said.

The Center For Pcli’cyStudies—a
Washington. DC. think tank—has
launched an extensive new study
into the assassination of President
Kennedy to determine if the U.S.
government covered-up a con-
spiracy to kill J.F.K.

The Center has created what it
calls the “Commission on Domestic
Intelligence and the Electoral
Process“; it consists of intelligence
community experts. former F.B.l.
special agents; former C.I.A.
technicians; photo-analysts; at-
torneys; and scholars.

The ﬁrst assignment of the new
task force is to secure all of the
evidence in the John Kennedy
assassination—much of it still
classified ——to determine whetherthe
F.B.l.. the C.I.A.. or other federal
police agencies participated in an
assassination cover-up.

The task force. itself. is being
headed up by attorney Mark Lane—
one of the first critics to attack the
government‘s verdict that Lee
Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing
President Kennedy.

Morton Halperin. the former
Assistant Secretary of Defense and
assistant to Henry Kissinger. madca
formal demand last week under the
“Freedom of Information Act" that
numerous government reports—still
classified as Scorch—be turned over
to the new commission.

Halperin has requested that secret
C.l.A. reports on Oswald and
ballistics testson bullets recovered at
the scene of the .I.F.K. slaying the
submitted to the task force.

The American Civil Liberties Un-
ion has stated it will assist the task
force in bringing any legal suits
necessary to force the government to
release classified assassination
cvidcnce.

LEERY LEARY

If there was ever any doubt about
the reports that Timothy Leary is
cooperating with federal
prosecutors. they were cleared up
last week when Leary madca phone
call to his old dricnd. Jaakov (Ya—
kof) Kohn.

Kohn. the editor of New York's
Soho Weekly News reports he was
questioned recently by the F.B.l.
about his own knowledge of Leary‘s
I971 prison escape. Kohn says he
was asked specifically about possible
involvement of the Weather un-
derground in Lcary'scscapc in [970.

Kohn says that after he refused to
answer the F.II.I.‘s questions. he
rcccivcd a telephone call from Leary.

  
 

ne-eurnv‘oems'o

Thousands of U.S. draft resisters .

who have become naturalized
citizens of other countries are being
denied re-entry into the United
States.

According to the American Civil
Liberties Union. at least 50 former
U .S. citizens who left the country to
avoid the draft have been told in the
past few weeks that they may not
enter the U.S. under any cir-
cumstances.

The A.C.L.U. says that in most
cases. the men who are being refused
permission to enter the country have
never been charged with a crime.

A spokesperson for the Immigra-
tion and Naturalization Service ad-
mitted its border agents had a policy
of turning draft resisters away. The
spokesperson stated that if a former

citizen‘s motives for changing his
citizenship were not acceptable to
immigration ofﬁcials. border agents
could legally deny the person the
right to re-enter the U.S.
GIRLS EXORCISED
The Roman Catholic Church in
Philadelphia has severed all lieswith
the Girl Scouts there because ofa sex
education program which teaches

 

the scouts. among other things.
about birth control.

The Archdiocese in Philadelphia
reported last week that its 8000
Catholic Girl Scouts would not be
able to meet on church premises
after July lst.

The r‘hurch is reportedly horrified
by the Girl Scout merit badge
program called “To Be A Woman.“
The program calls for frank dis—
cussions on cotttraccption.abortion
rape and the female anatomy.

The church said it was switching
over to Camp Fire Girl programs.
which include what the church calls

who was calling from an undisclosed wmcxl."
location in federal custody in 
Calil‘omia.

In the phone conversation which
was tape recorded. Leary tells Kohn
to cooperate with thc I".Il.l. Leary
explains that he has been
cooperating. saying he now believes
that all cover-ups must end and that
no one should keep secrets from
others.

Kohn says that despite Leary's
plea. he has decided against answer-

NIGHT onlvmc

Motorists in France are now able
to take a drug which helps them see
in the dark.

The new drug. called “nyctalux”.
was devoloped specially for drivers
who have trouble adjusting to the
problems of night driving.

Doctor Marc Chodkeiwicz. one of
the developers of the pill. says the
drug does not necessarily improve
overall night vision so that people
can see in the dark. He says that it
speeds up the ability of the eye to
make out figures in thedark after the
eye has been temporarily blinded by
being exposed to a bright light such
as a headlight.

Tests on the drug. Doctor
Chodkiewicz says. ind icatc that peo-
ple who take it regain their night vi-
sion I5 percent fastcrthan thosewho
have not.

DIAL-A-WITCH

You‘ve heard of Dial-A-Prayer or

Leek has started a daily phone line

she hopes soon to expand into a
nationwide operation.

Allyou haveto do isdial the magic
number. and you hear your
horoscope for the day and—
sometimesr—a national prediction
for the week.

Witch Sybilsays she hopes to have
Dial-A-Witch lines in most
American cities in the near future.

Note: The Dial-A-Witchnumber
in St. Louis is (3l4) 962-0099; Sybil

(305) 724-9777.

AVOID BEEF LIVER

Women in their first three months
of pregnancy should avoid eating
beef liver because it may contain
potentially dangerous levels of
DES.

This advice comes from the Direc-
tor of the National Cancer Institute.
Doctor Frank Rauschcr. at the same
time the U.S. government is moving
once again to approve the controver-
sial drug as a “morning after“ con-
traccptivc.

D.E.S. has been linked with
numerous cases of fatal cervical
canccr occurring in the daughters of
women who used the drug during
early pregnancies. It is now also used
as a cattle fattcncr in the U.S. despite
the fact that more than twenty coun-
tries around the world have banned
the drug as an additive in livestock
feed.

Use of I).E.S. as a "morning after“
pill has been approved by the
Federal Drug Administration and
will go into effect this Friday (March

7th).
POT KILLERS

A secret government research pro-
jch at the Univcrsity of California at

W

 

Berkeley has developed a fungus

.7

which attacks and kills marijuana
plants while leaving all other plants
unharmed. 7
High Titties magazine reports that
the government project was carried
out by Doctor Arthur Mrﬂain. a
specialist in plant pathology. Doctor

 

McCain claims to have already

isolated the pot-killing fungus—a
type known scientifically as
“fusarium orisporan.“

Doctor McCain explains that
fungi cart be found that will kill
almost any kind of specific plant#
but he concentrated on an anti-
ntarijuann fungus because he “knew
the government could be interested"
in it.

One would think that “anti-pot“
research would be particularly un-
popular in Berkeley. but the doctor
says he‘s encountered no problems.
He explains: “I try to keep my

visibilit low.“

LEAD POISONING

Kalph Nader's health
research group says that canned milk
and canned fruit juices continue to
expose millions of American babies
to possible lead poisoning.

In a letter to the Food and Drug
Administration this Week. the health
group cited four government studies
which found potentially dangerous
levels of lead in canned milk and
fruit juices. Most of the lead results
from soldered seams in the cans. the
Nader group says.

High levels of lead can produce
brain damage. illnesses and even
death in infants—
