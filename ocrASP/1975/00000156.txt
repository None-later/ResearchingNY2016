Somewhere, behind the cries of “racism”, the tension, the intimidation. the raised
voices and the emotional speeches. are the essential issues of funding EOPSA (Equal
Opportunity Program Student Association). Asevents in the Campus Center last night
have‘proved. these issues are not really discussed, nor is it likely that .they ever have
been or. now. ever will be.

By closing the Asitembly Hall and not permitting entrance or exit without a vote on
their budget. EOPSA acted in complete violation of themost fundamental rights of free
speech and democratic action. These mass action tactics on the part of black EOPSA
students can only be aimed at pressuring SA to ignore the procedures that have been
carefully set up to handle just the funding disagreements that were in evidence last
night. And to deny that they were intimatating Council by temporarily imprisoning
them is pure nonsense.

When ﬁfty black students decided to occupy the Student Association office yester-
day afternoon they were applying pressure on SA leaders for an immediate reversal of
the stance on their budget that was taken by the Executive Branch Budget Committee
the night before. The committee recommended a thirty thousand dollar slash in the
EOPSA budget request of about thirty-seven thousand dollars. Central Council
Chairperson Lew Fidler called last night's Council meeting where it was decided. in the
presence of fifty to one hundred EOPSA students. to budget EOPSA at a ﬁgure close
to their original request.

The Budget Committee's vote was based on what they thought EOPSA is: a black
student group. They felt it should be funded asa black group rather than asa campus-
wide programming group. Their decision. an immense philosophical one that may not
be in their charge as a committee. was based on some information that they have learn-
ed since to be misleading. One budget committee memberwas stunned to hear Speaker
‘s Forum Chairperson Sandra Bodner say that the EOPSA people would get people at
the University who would otherwise not not get here. “She never told us that." he said.

But regardless of the wisdom of their decision. what justification is there for cir-
cumventing the budgeting process? After all. Budget Committee is simply an advisory
committee to the SA President. and Pat Curran happens to be in favor of funding
EOPSA at the level they want to be funded. He could simply change the EOPSA
budget to his liking before Council ever would look at it.

There are two official and one unofficial reason for this circumvention. which has
resulted in the resignation of half the committee.Fidler said that he didn‘t wattt to see
SA waste its time in the coming weeks hassling with student'groups when there are far
more important lights to be had with the administration. FSA. and other
organizations that deal with student rights. It has also been argued that such a major
policy change that would indeed represent the end of EOPSA as it has been known
dcscrves immediate attention. without even waiting two days for the next regular
Council meetingIl‘he unofficial reason isthat Council met because it was scared not to.

To the extent that fear was involved in the decision to hold a Council meeting last
night it is a very unfortunate sign of weakness in SA. When students came to takeover
Yale University President Kingman Brewster’s office a few years ago. he showed them
where the cigars were and left. They eventually got tired of
sitting in; it got them publicity and in the following weeks their demands were discussed
in a far more rational manner. Maybe SA could have done something similar.

Nexts year’s EOPSA is very similar tolast year‘s.and while that may have been what
should have happened at some later time anyway. the speed and atmosphere of the
EOPSA funding that occurred last night is not something one can point to with pride.

Errata

in a Tom Darcy cartoon that ran on this page recently. there was a reference to the
Dale Ca rnegic course and used its corporate logo. Mr. Darcy informed us that the use
of the logo and the cartoon was not attthorizcd by the Dale Carnegie organization. The
‘apology‘ was worked out by Ncwsday lawyers to the satisfaction ofthc Dale Carnegie
Corporation.

ERA: The Redundant
27th Amendenl

The proposed twenty-seventh amendment
is now only four states short ofthc thirty—eight
needed for ratification: "liquality of rights
under the law shall ttot he dctticd or abridged
by the United States on account of sex."

Americans. perhaps tnorc than any other
society. have a penchant for equality. We view
inequality its tantamount to injustice. It means
that not all are contpctittg on the same level.
and if nothing else. we in this cottntry like to
believe that competitive 'airncss exists for all.
Since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of
[964 social equality and opportunity for
blacks and women has become of: great
importance to Americans.

The Equal Rights Amendment sets for itself
a fine ideal to achieve in the pursuit of
equality. However. tltc fttll implementation of
the fourteenth amendment supplants any need
for the ERA. The fourteenth amendment
reads: “No state shall make or enforce any law
which shall abridge the privileges or
immttnitics of citizens of the United States;
nor deny to any pcrson...cqual protection
under the law." The message tltc twcnty-
seventh amendment hopes to convey is
already clearly present within thc fourteenth
amendment of lttoll. in addition the
fourteenth amendment provides that:
"Congress shall have the power to
cnforcc...the provisions of this article."

The fourteenth amendment possesses for us
today the power to enforce the type of

legislation egalitarinns are looking for in the
fight against discrimituttion. In proper
perspective. tltc equal rights issue brought up
by this new amendment is quite superfluous.

Al the time that hcarings for equal rights for
men and women Were held in l97l tWo
proposals were made. ()nc proposal was made
for a constitutional amendment. The second

 

 

 

proposal was for it bill which would fall short

carry out the fourteenth amendment in
eliminating sexual inequality in to!“
cdttcation. and general opportunttteu. lht
liRA itt comparison to the Women‘s l qtmlm
Act is at best general. and ambiguous

At the congressional hearings on equal
rights Senator Sam lirvin submitted tltt
following testimony: "The equal protection

rights and responsibilities turn upon
scx...l{esorting to an amendment to the
Constitution to effect llti'-. purpose (to ttclttcu‘
sexual equality) is about as wise as using an

To amend means to correct the
