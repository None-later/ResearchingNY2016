wonders which awaited me there.
Before my dazzled eyes sparkled a
cornucopia of exotic fruits, rare meats

aback to see seine arch-fiend dashing
desperately towards me with a grimy
pile of crackers in his dirty little hands.
Naturally, I was repulsed by his foul,
gasping breath, his slavering,
incoherent mumbles and his wild,
dishevelled attire. But more than this, I
was appalled, disgusted, horrified—as
any champion of Truth, Freedom and
Justice in this, land of brotherhood
would be—by the ignorant, loathsome,
diseased moral code of one who dared
steal from The Kitchen! Yet, I felt a

t's been another one of
I "those days." How do they
happen, and why do they
happen?

There is just so much time one can
delve into this matter without going
insane. All I plan on doing is to recount
the events that actually took place
today. However, bear in mind that this
is one of the best "wrong days" that I've
ever experienced because nothing
was traumatic or tragic.

Ah yes, it was a bad start. this
morning. The alarm clock went off.
That stupid machine had no right to
work! Who in their rightmind wants to
get up on a rainy Monday morning? I
contemplated several possibilities
while I was in my semi-conscious
morning state. I could either get out of
bed and get ready for class,
immediately go back to sleep, or run
around the Quad doing my Annette
Funicello imitation.

I immediately did away with the
latter alternative, because I can't even
do an imitation of myself, lol alone that
non-entity of a mouseketeer.

me, sheathed that weak chink in my
armor, made me a man. Now 1 can
remain passively at my meal while the
amassed weapons of several armies of
Kitchen Marines bear down upon a
lone victim, attempting to escape with
a store of illicit bagels beneath his shirt.
Now I can close‘ myears to the screams
for mercyemitted by the victims of the,
pitiless Cafeteria Secret Service. I can
even watch without compunction or
emotion as the Kitchen Guards drag
away my suitemates and my best
friends, caught red-handed with a
lowly box of Sugar Smacks or a pat of
butter. For, I ask you, is it possible for
men of virtue and reason to associate
with thieves and rogues of such low
degree? I should say not! It is rather the
duty of every red-blooded American,
for it is through the elimination of these
degenerates that we purity and
preserve our freedom. ‘
Recently, however, it has come to my
attention that insidious outside
agitators are tomenting rebellion
againstour loyal and admirable F.S.A.
Why, this very morning, as I went
through my daily indoctrination
procedures before breakfast, I was
shocked to hear discontented
mumbling in the shadows behind me.
Only yesterday afternoon several of
my associates of the Young Men's
Junior Communist Elimination Society

I quickly decided not to go to class
because it required the impossibly
trying task of crawling out of bed.
Before I went to the glorious condition
of unconsciousness, l notified my
roommate as to my diligent and logical
decision to sleep away the day.

I then immediately hit into my
second problem. Why did ldeserve a
responsible roommate who not allow
me to go back to sleep? Who
masterminded this intricate plot that
forces me to go to school? I must get to
the bottom of this. Why couldn't I have
a normal roommate who encouraged
laziness, irresponsibility and non-
performance? I just know that she was
hired by my parents. My very own
roommate! A traitor! A Benedict
Arnold! How could she?

In the middle of this melodramatic
revelation, my roommate's voice
interrupted, and before I know it, some
mysterious and all-powerful force had
gotten me to my feet. Of course, my
head and hands were on the floor too,
but at least I was out of bed. I
miraculously got my clothes on
correctly, and I stumbled to my classes.

(YMICES) brought the rising curve or
cafeteria thefts to my attention; and
rumors have been passing through the
grapevine of the state—wide 'kitchen
coup' by secret guerilla armies within
the F.S.A.

Oh, ye of little faith! Things have
come to a pretty pass when the future
heirs of this noble Republic can bearto
entertain the thought of such black
treachery against the guardians of our
digestive systems and the American
Way!

Oh, lknow things have been getting
rough lately. The economy is plunging, .
prices are scaring, the Board of Health
is imposing strict regulations upon our
struggling leaders, and even Sunday
dinner isn't quite the fete it used to be.

But think, comrades! Use your minds

for once, instead of your bellies! Fill
those pockets with statistics of the
starving rriultitudes of Outer Mongolia,
not with trifles such as bread and
doughnuts! Rise up against the
dictatorship of the body, not the
benevolence of our faithful leaders!
Which would you rather face—an
empty stomach or the pitiless minions
of Cafeteria Marines? Which would
you rathertreasure in the twilight years,
of your life—the damning evidence of
crumbs in your pockets or the smiling
face of the Kitchen Sentry as you walk
up the stairs to the living world, empty-

l appeal to you. my fellow dwellers in
the land of plenty! Surrender your
dirty, ill-begotten hoards and return to
the virtuous hands of your brothers!

ookt Up in the air! It' s a bird,

L no, it’s a plane. Why, it seems

to be a frightened little boy
olding on to his seat with all the
ravery of the cowardly lion.
Pilot Carey Friedman, SUNYA
tudent, got clearance from Page
irport in Albany. We taxied on the
nway, (that's aerospace jargon for
tarling ou‘r engines), and awaited
errnission for take-off. The Tower was
uick to respond.

Friedman had already finished the
re-trial check. He explained that a
ilol doesn't want to have water in the

aler in the gas tanks. You need full
ower for take-offs." Friedman spun

wo movies, they would have about
en guys tuming them." I had always

ought the turning the propellers was
for effect— to have all these jealous
guys give the brave pilot a royal send-
off on his mission to bomb Berlin.

While taxiing, Friedman found out
from ground control what radio
frequency to use. "Winds are out of the
east. . .On backside of low pressure,"
the toy radio growled.

The "plane bucks a little on the lake-
ofl but don't let that bother you any,"
Friedman said nonchalanlly.

and pay attention to the road so we
don't crash," I screeched.

As the plane continued to rise in
altitude, my hands became more
tense. Friedman kept rambling, but I
sat transfixed.

said. "You know you can't go flying

earlier in the week. Seven full days
were wasted because of either too

explained. "Why did today have to be

Romantic and morbid illusions of me
reading tomorrow's daily to find my
baby picture lambasted all over page

“Look I'm just sitting here not doing a
thing," my sedate pilot announced. "I
know," lnervously thought,"that's the
problem— this thing is flying itself.
And in the meantime I'm giving myself

Frieman let me command the plane.

A plane is steered by the joint
movement of a w

"Doctor Spock, calling Captain Kirk.

what's the problem?" Spock anxiously
counters; "You're steering us into the

With that fantasy finished, I returned

lessons for twenty-two dollars an hour,
circles over the SUNYA campus, down
to the South Mall, and returned.

Back on the safe terresterial earth
Friedman asked receptionist. “What's
new in the flying world of Page."
"Nothing," she answered.

"Page is one of the top fifteen airports
in the United States," he said. "You just
don't need giant complexes unless
you're in large metropolitan areas."
"When you fly against the wind it's all
physics and vectors— or you do it by
the seat of your pants, so to speak,"
Friedman remarked. "Planes always
land into the wind," he added.

"Female students seem to'do better
than males— males don't listen
enough. They try to do their own
thing," Friedman said. "It‘s better to sit
and listen."

On the ground Friedman tried to ‘
dispel my flying fears. "Air travel is
more than ten times as safe as cars," he
noted. In the US. alone, 50,000 die
each year from autos while in the world
only 5,000 die from airplane crashes.’
And that includes the military," he
added.

"Flying in a small light plane is safer
than flying in a big jet because if the
engine goes you can glide pretty far in
small planes," he said. My Erica long
fears were greatly diminished, but 1
thing the fact that we were on the
ground had something to do with it.

"Most pilots are killed when they
don't pro-trial Check their airplanes,
check how rriuch gas they have, or fly
in bad weather conditions," the pilot
noted.

Our plane, N4024U, has returned to
its dug-out niche, surrounded by
moleholes of snow.

I left Page in contemplation of the
great American novel I would soon

write.
