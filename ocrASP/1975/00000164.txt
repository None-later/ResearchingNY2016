' ﬂare the NCAA Regional tour-

mm at Vnrocltport. all four
 involved thought the tour-
nlimt was pretty well balanced.
my also felt any team was capable
“twinning. As things turned out.
there wasn't one close ball game. The
itiinmest margin of Victory was the
mic, 83-70 triumph over RF] in
the opening round of the playoffs.
The Danes got blown out tw1ce.
whitest. Lawrence got blitzed 1n the
finals. .
The championship game could
have been a good game if St.
Lawrence’s center.~ Tony Ross was
100%, Rossplayed a whale of a game
again]! Albany. as he helped the
Saints dominate the offensrve
boards. He injured his ankle toward
the end of the Albany game and he
was in obvious pain versus
Brockport. Also theSaintswcre mis-
sing their top playmakcr. Dan
Watkins for much of the game
because of foul trouble. He killed the
Danes with his hot shooting and
when he did play against Brockpon.
he got his team's offense moving.

For Albany. the two tournament
games were reminiscent of the
Danes‘ performance in the opening
contest of the 1969 tournament. In
that game Albany suffered its worse
loss ever when they were beaten by
Wagner 109-61. The following day
the Syracuse papers had stories
stating that Albany went out and
beat hometown LeMoync 71-70 in
the consolation/game. proving the
newspapers wrong. Unfortunately.
the 1975 Danes never got their
chance to show that they can play
good basketball.

Mike Suprunowicz was the
Danes‘ high scorer for the tourna-
merit. as he averaged 15 points per
ball game. He had 22 points against
RPI. Ed Johnson had a big game
against St. Lawrence. scoring 22
points but he was held in check
against RPI, scoring only five
points. It was the first time all year
that Eddie did not reach double
ﬁgures. Forward Bob Audi had it
poorfournamcnt. averaging 5.5 for
thetwo games. Hewas held scoreless
in the crucial second half versus St.
Lawrence. Pete Koola played two of
his better games during the tourna-
ment. He was the Danes lending
rebounder in both games as he clos-
ed out his Albany State career.

Albany State students Would cer-
tainly be jealous if they would sec
Brockporl‘s athletic facilities. They
have a tremendous sports complex
that houses the basketball arena. a
beautiful hockey rink, many other
basketball courts and a big pool.

Brockport ccrtainlydcservcd to be
champions as they played two solid

games. They are a very strong team
andcould wellgo on to become Divi-
sion 111 national champions. Kevin
Williams was the tournament MVP
as the big center averaged 20.5 for
both games. including a tournament
high 27 points against RPI. He was
devastating from underneath. The
Panaggio brothers also made the all-
tournament team as they both had
two very good nights. They provided
much of Brockport‘s offense. Pops
McTaw failed to make the all-
tournament team as he had an off
night against RI’I because of foul
trouble. He did come back to score
22 points against St. Lawrence.

Jimmy Young of St. Lawrence
and Mike McDoneIiofRi’l rounded
out the all-tournament tctim. Both
players had a big hand in defeating
Albany. Young had 26 points
against the Danes whilc McDoncll
had 17 points and If) rebounds.

The Panaggio family was out in
full force to root Dun Mikc. couch
