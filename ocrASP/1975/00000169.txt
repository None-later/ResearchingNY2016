The ieoent controversy surrounding EOPSA and SA has been concentrated on the '

issues of procedures and tactics. There is far more to the issue than that, however; The
key to the entire situation is whether or not EOPS A deserves to be funded. And there is
vlittler‘doubt that it does. ‘

a. The principle of there being a group programming black cultural events is based on
the assumption that the existing mechanisms for programming are not able to serve the
black students‘ needs. This is not to say that blacks do not see movies put on by Albany
State Cinema (they do) or are never seenyat Dutch Quad parties (they are). but simply
that there 'are' certain kinds of cultural events that are important to the members of
EQPSAV and simply " not that important to the people running. these and other
organizations. To force EOPSA to baggie with Concert Board in order to convince
them to put on one group or the other would be to ignore basic differences in cultural
orientation

Thére is not enough communication between blacks and whites at this University to
make it likely that whitescontrollingprogramming will understand what is needed by
the black student body here. If there was continuous communication there would never
have been an EOPSA. That the Executive Branch Budget Committee would suggest a
cut f rom $37,000 to $7.000 with so little discussion is indicative of a paucity of contact
between the two groups. That decision deserved far more discussion and thought than

it received. And it is hoped that they would realize after proper investigation. that a cut
of that magnitude was completely unwarranted.

It is no surprise that EOPSA doesn't trust SA when that kind of unthinking action is
taken. It indicates the inherent weakness in the budget system itself that was debated
by SA President Pat Curran and EOPSA President Fred Stokelin in their joint
statement on page l0 today.

The imprisoning of Central Council Monday is completely inexcusable but it is an
effect. not a cause. '

The details of funding E0 PSA. the exact amount funded and the degree of spending
freedom allowed the group. are other issues that are subsidiary to the basic issue of
funding them. The funding itself has been questioned because it appearsinefficientto
have two diff erentgroupspursuing speakers, two different groups organizing concerts.
and other overlapping when it could be avoided by eliminating most of EOPSA. But
this outlook ignores the lack of communication. and icommunicationi essential before
that kind of “efficiency” would make sense. -

To Save. by Destroying

Politicians were never known for their reasoning powers, but recent statements
from the Ford administration seem to indicate ‘things may be worse than originally
thought.

In an effort to avert a Cambodian “bloodbath” when the insurgents takeoverin the
neat future, Ford has proposed we try to extend the present American-financed
bloodbath going on there. Though one might think that the greatest concern in Ford‘s
mind is to save lives, in. truth be is proposing that thousandsmorcdie and thousands
more suffer. and at our tax-payer‘sexpense.

Spending money for: armaments and talking about being humanitarian is quite
absurd; saving Cambodia by sending guns and bullets is analogous to helping your
friend get home faster by pushing him out a window. It is encouraging to note the
stance House Democrats have taken against aid to Cambodia. It is hoped that if there
is aid it will be in the form of food or other non-military assistance.

Errata

Louis Welch was mistakenly referred to as VicewPrcsident for Research in Tuesday's
issue. He is Vice-President for Univesity Affairs. Also. the column From tthapiIoI:
called “Pressed for Time“ was written by David Lerner.

Thousands Excluded
From Clemency Program

 

Some 7.500 Americans in Canada. together
with smaller numbers in other countries of
Europe and Asia. may be excluded from
participating in the President's amnesty
program by the US. Immigration and
Naturalization Service (lNS).

These men are primarily Vietnam war
rcsistcrs who have been in their host countries
loitg enough to have bccomc naturalized
citizcns (iii the citscofCaniidii. five years). and
who are deemed by INS to be alien “who have
dcpiirtcd from or who have remained outside
the United States to avoid or evade triiiiiingor
service iii the armcd forces.“

The President's clemency program
specifically excludes from participation
persons whose situation fits that quote. which
is from it section of the immigration and
nationality Ittw iii the United States Code (ti
U.S.C. Hill (it) (22)),

Atid although the law and case history tll‘c
ha/y. leaving plctity of room to help
thousands of these young titcti who might
otherwise piirticipiitc in thc clemency
program. the INS liiis so far stcndfastlyrefuscd
to bend.

Moreover. many of these men have never
been charged with cvttding the draft or
anything else. and in many instances. where
charges have been brought. crises have been
dismissed or dropped.

.To'cap the dance. INS has created it
situation in which the burden ofprooffulls not
upon the government but upon the 7.500. That
is. the assumption thiit thcsc Americans left
to avoid thcdraft.iind if that isn‘t the case then
it's up to the person who left to prove it.

If that doesn‘t sound to you like the way
courts are supposed to operate. there's ll
reason for it: note that these decisions are
mitdc tidministnttivcly. not judicially. The
only effective recourse is appeal to a panel of
administratch liiw judges. a sort of quasi-

The American Civil Liberties Union has
bccit working behind the scenes to littd .t \\.l\
to permit thousands of young Alllcllt‘illh in
this situation to participate in the Clclllt'llt\

Everyone Always Liked Groucho Best '

by Steve Ganz

“Certainly l”know the names of
the three Marx Brothers. They‘re
Groucho. Hirpo, and Chico;“ or
“Oh yeah. you must mean Groucho.
Chico and Harpo.“ lnvuriably. the
mention of the Marx Brothers illicits
Groucho‘s name numero uno. Har-
po and Chico file behind as if to be
subordinate members of the trio. I
contend. on the contrary. that Har-
po is. by farand away, the most com-
plex. sensitive and creative oftill the

others.

Webster defines institutioiiitlism
as “an emphasis on organization (its
in religion) at the expense of other
factors.“ It iswcll recognized that the
Marx Brothers thrive at destroying
these institutions. whctcr they be

laughter dies. we are left with a feel-
ing of emptiness. Harpo. on the
other hand. takes us a great step
further. In addition to being it great
comedian and a subtle satirist. he
attempts to redefine life by
emphasizing the "other factors“
alluded to in the definition above.
He strives for an underlying purity
and innocence devoid of society‘sin-
stitutions. and as I will show. often
attempts to or scend reality com-
pletely. Hence. he constructs a uni-
que perspective of reality.

On the surface. Harpo redefines
life by attacking three of society‘s
most acknowledged institutions;
namely our dress code. means of
connnunication and eating hiiits. As
far as dress goes. his clownish attire
might well be a form of cotintcreon-
formity but I tend to think lie truly
feels comfortable in his outfit. He
has ito need for the "stuffy" dress
code society often enforces. At
times. he blatantly satirizcs it to be
both funny and to make a point. c.g.
the entrance of The Professor iii
Animal Crackers. Hurpo appears
cloaked in a black ciipcnnd carrying
it cutie. only to be wearing lln
.-“ittitllticll'W~ th.

4 u I; “ﬁtter iotion "action
speaks louder tliiiit words.“ he is the

embodiment of ear perfect com-
munication. His book. whistle. facial
expressions and bodily contortions
express a complete vocabulary of
“words” as well as uninhibited
feelings. not always permitted in our
“cmotionally-stmctured' society.
Groucho and Chico continuously
mock our language. (n.b. the famous
“Why a Duck“ scene where puns are
landed left and right) but never truly
communicate as sensitively as Hiir-
po does.

Music. considered to be a signifi-
cant transmitter of feelings is an in-
tegral part of his character. Often
used in conjunction with ex-
traniusical objectives. c.g. love.
satire. the instrument is yet another
vehicle used for enhanced human
understanding.

Hiler goes even so far its to
destroy the "fallacy" ofour requiring
three balanced mcitls daily. He
replaces it with his itotioit of it well
balttccd dict: incltiding. a button
from tbejackct of it page boy for an
appetizer. a tclcphonc swallchd
with tlic tiid of ll bottle of ink its an
cntrcc and ii beverage. and ii crisp
[lower for dc‘ en (The Cocoiiniits).

Whilc sutii'izing our oftimcs
peculiar drcss.‘ltinguitgc and eating
hiibits(hzimburgcrs and french fries 7

times it week). he replaces it with his
own version. There is no institution
that l-lnrpo docsii‘t have it “better
way“ for. including our dairestonc-
lovc.

llurpo rcstructurcs otir concep-
tioti of love for his is like no otic
clscs. It is unlike (iroiicho's satirical
though i'ccblcatlenipt at lovemaking
(ii.b. (ironcho‘s countless scenes

"misdirected". as it is not for the love
til it woman. The weak attempt of
l’cnclopc in the Coconnuts to seduce
llitrpo with her hiiiiturc is shunned
by lillrpt). for his is truly lllflllllillcd
with a horse. He sings to otic in
lloi'scfctithcrs (outing of its outs its
wcll): sleeps with one. preferring it
over it yoting girl (Duck Soup); ititd
produces it picttirc of ii horse when
asked if he was ever in love. It is his
contention that the questioner is iii-
dccd tltc dcviiint as he laughs at his
rcsoiisc (Animal Crackers). His love
was truly genuine.

Miiybe he found the lovc of ii
woman to "be oftimcs fttll of
hypocrisy. iiccdlcss anxiety. ctc.'.’
This is probably the c ' '. however.
infrequent moments c where he
displays it love for a ‘i'ctil“ girl. I‘m
itot referring to his mad dashing
across the set lor the illusch blond.
Riitlicr along tltc lines of his sincere
rendition of “Everyone Says 1 Love
You" on the harp for Connie Billlcy
outside of her bedroom window
(The Coctinuts). Once again. Harpo
finds satisfying alternatives to
society‘s institutions; Groucho and
Chico offer none.

littl'ptl goes much further thiiiijust
supplyinganswcrs to society's ills. At
times. ltc creates a totally new reality
for himself. transcending his own ex—
istcncc by being botli timclcssititd in-
animate. (oii the verge of immortali-
ty). He leaves his poor "mortal"
brothers flll‘ behind. It sounds like
surrealism us he “scachcs for it new
reality beneath tltc conscious mind
in drcitni states or in bizznrc acts of
fate.“ llitrpo himself says. “Most
people hiivcii consciotis and a sub-
coitciotis. Not inc l have it sub-
conscious and ll sub-subconscious."
(Quotations front Groom. C/tim.
liar/m rim! Sometimes Zap/m. by
Joe Adamson). Minty examples
come to mind; the incredible broken

mirror scene in Duck Soup where be
virtually becomes (iroucho‘s double

where he desperately tries to hold

firms l‘illt‘po‘s‘ desire to destroy

tions dominated audience.

Otir society has defined for us the
proper role to play at each phase of
our lives tllld in each situation we
find ourselves in. One who does not
play the assigned role could very well
hc considered abnormal. lly Harpo‘s
definition. though. he‘s not com-
mitted to play the rolcofa Stowaway
or of anyone else for that matter.
Rolcpiaying is it society construct.
an artificial one. llitrpo. with facili—
ty. plays iill roles equally well accor-
ding to the situation he finds himself
in.

Each itiovic illustrates fill of these
qualities and much more. Harpo was
an incredible comedian and I
suspect. and equally remarkable
buntiin hciiig. Certainly the world of
llitrpo Marx on the screen is one of
anarchy; however. he does offer
alternatives to our coping with reali-
ty. They are for the taking. Go to the
ll“(i films of the Marx Brothers this
weekend. and focus on Htirpo. And
when someone approaches you and
says. “Hey. did you see the Marx
llrothers iltis weekend‘l“. you‘ll res-
pond with. “Sure. you must mean.
llitrpo. Chico and Groucho.“
