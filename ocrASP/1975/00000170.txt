The lrlshiRovcrs are so different ‘

from any other! contemporary
musical gioup that an entirely uni-
que set of standards must be
employed when judging them. Their
audience is not just teen-age and
college people; instead it ranges

through every age group.Thcy do not'

specialize in rock music. but in Irish
ballads and drinking songs. usually
ﬁlled‘with rich humor. Their reper-
toirejs of the sing-along‘nature. and
indeed much of their appeal rests
uponaudience participation. They
do not glitter. they do not flash. they
are not loud. What theydo have isan
intimate. friendly appeal, which
their admirers expect and receive in
abundance.
I Played to 600

The Rovers were in concert this
past Sunday night at the Palace
Theater in Albany. They played to a
good sized crowd of about 600. who
ranged in age from toddlers to great

classical forum-

grandmothers. These people gave I
the Rovers a warm reception as they .

ran onstage.
The Rovers have been together a
long time. and not just as a'group,

although this year they did celebrate

their tenth anniversary together. In
fact. it‘s almost a family act. The

'group leader is Will Miller. who

plays guitar. mandolin and har-
monica. his brother George. also on
guitar. and their cousin Joe. who was
on bass. The lead singer, Jimmy
Ferguson and accordianist Wilcil

McDowell liVed near‘ the Miller

family in Northern Ireland. and all
live grew up together. which has
created a strong cohesiveness that
still exists. They li'now each other‘s
movements. habits and peculiarities.
and their timing as they work
together. both on song and conver-
sation with the audience. is quite ex-
traordinary.

The entire two hour set was of a
consistent quality." their usual

procedure being a song. followed by
a bit of conversation with the
audience. The latter usually con-.
sisted of jokesand humorous stories.
discussions of the virtues of liquor.
and introductions to songs the group
felt wereof particular importance of
interest. The songs. as i‘e said. were
usually ballads of either lost love or
humorous events in the life of the
average Irishman. And. of course.
the sense of Ireland was ever present.
from the songs themselves to the
heavy brogue evident in every voice
in the group.

Before the first song had ended.
their particular appeal was clearly
evident as many in the audience were
clapping in time with the music and
tapping their feet. all of which was
encouraged by the Rovers. The
audience seemed to truly enjoy this.
and complied with even greater for—

Freud Analyzes Classical Art

The intellectual interests of Sigmund Freud were not
by any means limited to psychoanalysis. in which he
pioneered. but rather ranged widely over many fields of
inquiry. Time, in its issue of January 6. I975. rcportcd
Freud‘s experimentation with cocaine. in which he
hoped to find a miracle drug. During the months of
November through January it most remarkable exhibi-
tion at the Jewish Museum in New York City focused
attention on another relatively unknown facet of Freud‘s
life: his serious interest in archaeology and his collection
of antiquities.

Vienna

The exhibition featured two kinds of things. First.
there were photographs of the apartment and office
which Freud maintained for almost half a century at
Berggnssc I9 in Vienna. These photographs were taken
by Edmund Engclmnn. who now lives on Long Island. in
I938. shortly before Freud Icft Vienna for London. They
show how Freud‘s antiquities filled his cabinets. shelves.
tables. and desk. 'l'hcnk thcrc were twelve ancient art
objects once owned by Freud and lent to the museum by
his daughter Anna. who still lives in London. In time

these objects ranged from the second millenium B.C.E.
to the second century C.E.: ancient Near Eastern. Egyp-
tian. Greek. Etruscan. and Roman art wcrc represented.
Among the objects was one o fwhich Frcudtwascspccial-
Iy food. it small .Ianus-hcadcd bronrc iigurcspszinerva '
and Silcnus. all

' Frcud frequently visited archaeological sites in Italy.
especially Pompeii. When he visited the United Statesin
l909 he made it a point to see the Ccsnola collection of
antiquities in New York City‘s Metropolitan Museum of
An. In Paris one of the most important attractions to
hint was the Egyptian obelisk in the I’lucc dc Ia Con-
corde. Freud‘s library contained many books on
archaeology. “I have read more archaeology than psy-
chology.“ he once wrote Iothc author Stefan Ztveig. He
felt that archaeology provided insights into psychology.
His interests were “intcrdisciplinnry“ long before that
word had been invented.

Finally. since most pcoplt: are familiar with the Frcu~
diun concept of the Oedipus complex. it might be men-
tioned that Freud‘s office contained a copy of Ingrc‘s pai-
nting. “Oedipus and the Sphinx."

on their singing ability. It was this in-

in a playground. followed abruptly
by chilling 'visions of children in
Belfast playing with guns amidst
barriers and barbed wire. and older
youths taunting British soldiers and
tossing home-made bonbs at tanks
as they rolled through the city
streets. Although the song did slip
into sticky sentimentality. the effect
was quite sobering.

In summation. I would say that
the concert was a great success. The
Rovers. for all their down.home in-

seems so distant as to be in another
place; more often than not. you‘re
watching an audience watching Tull.
or an episode of In Concert that con-
sists of long shots and sweeping pan-
orama of the concert hall.

Tull‘s sound system proved to be
ineffective. at high altitudes. in-
creasing the uncomfortable feeling
of having just paid $7.50 for a ticket
and not even being there.

Strangely.an eight o’clock concert
was beginning at live minutes to
eight. Carmen opened the show.
playing .to a three quarters empty
house. but when they exited. encore-
less. after forty minutes. the Garden
was packed. They played fast. engag-
ing Spanish tinged rock. complete
with castenets and flamenco dancing
on an electrically amplified dance
floor. They were excellent. but once
again just could not handle the
tremendous size of the Garden. It
would have been a more interesting
set if they had waited for more of the
audience to ﬁnd their seats. and
perhaps even played a little longer——
though both these drawbacks were
simply indications of the tight pre-
programmed format of the evening‘s
presentation.

The Who. Zeppelin. the Stones.
E LP. Tu ll-thcse are the
“stipergroups” of today. and each
one of them would have no trouble
selling out a few shows at the Gar-
den. but can any of them really play
to such a Iargcand distant audience?
Many of the special effects and
pyrotechnics of 'l'ull‘s cxtravaganra
were lost on a sizeable portion ofthe
audience.

The show itself was quite a well
organircd. polished presentation.

Neither Thick AsA Brick nor A Pax-
u'tm Play dominated us they had in
he past. Instead. Tull performed
thout fifteen or twenty minutes of

_ each of these albums. filling in htc

rest of their short. ninety minute set
with six of the ten songs on War
Child. six also from Aqualung. and
one or two from Living in [/10 Far!

“Ill did some interesting things

with the actual performing area of

the stage; two platforms were built

out in front. one on either side of the
stage. onto which guitarist Martin
Barre and bassistJelfrey Hammond-

out and play. There was also a long
balcony set up above and behind the
stage. allowing Anderson even more
room to dash about. and providing
the means for his grand entrance at

The antics of Ian Anderson are a
main attraction. the center ring of
this mad three ring circus called
Jethro Tull. He's allover the stage at
once. jumping. waving. swinging his
Ilute in wide circles about his head.
Dressed in a long greatcoat. high
boots and a large codpicce Anderson
is the focal point of the group on

Tull. running the group with an iron
fist. controlling the flow and direc-
tion of the music with a turn of his
hand or a twist of his amt. Un-
disputedly the captain. he runsu very
tight ship. everything carefully
planned coordinated and

But that's notull there is to this cir-

most of the performance. leaving to
