‘. Thia‘isa’nicestory,ibecausepeople
who work for Telethon arenice 

pie. ltwould also be a very big story '

if it mentioned all the people, who
through their efforts and donations,
help to make the show a very special
success. . '

But this is just a nice little story,
and so it is about seniors Stu Bellus,
Mike Klein. and Dave Ardarn who
entertained during the small hours of
Saturday morning. '

Someoneonce said that, forenter-
tainers, a little talent can be a
dangerous thing. It might get them
to thinking that they are better than
they are, which can be sad. But in
Telethon. it is a lot of little talent
which makes such a big importance
to the kids of Wildwood.

Stu, Mike, and Dave have a little
talent, but only a little. They each
play guitar and sing, and they would
sound very good playing for a party
in your living room. On stage in a
large ballroom, however, they are
not so impressive. They know it.

Yet they performed because
Telethon needs a lot of good people
who can ﬁll in the spaces between the
good performers. And besides, even
the bad performers see the dollars
grow larger on thedonation board at
the side of the stage. They see it in-
crease as they play, and they ﬁnd
their pride in that.

The three ascended ttrthe stage for
the ﬁrst time at 2:55 am. They were
not, to say the least, ostentatious in
manner. All wore blue jeans and
work boots,‘with only Dave appear-
ing a little showy in a navy blue
sweater-vest over his light cotten
shirt. Stu and Mike stuck to basic
ﬂannel.

Their performance. at ﬁrst was
not outstanding to anylargerldegree
than their clothes. “Tin Town" was
done with tempo variations never
employed by Seals and Crofts.
“Comin‘ into Los Angeles" was
better. however, and the remaining
audience of about [00 showed it in
their response.

Leaving the stage, Mike, who is
thin, medium height with dark,
shoulder-length hair and a mustache
off the album cover of “Sergeant
Pepper's“, was the first to ask his
friends, “What'd ya think?”

Stu. the same size as Mike, and
with red center-parted hair quickly
replied, “We‘ve been better." Then

adding, "The ﬁrst song wasn't suited
for such a big room. You'd think
we'd know after three years of doing
this not to try quiet songs."

After getting backstage to the
Fireside Lounge, Dave, tall with
dark, styled hair, a baby face and
blue eyes, admitted “i kept forget-
ting the words.“

Stu: “I know. I kept looking at
you for cues and all i saw waslb'la
ble bla bla' coming out of your
mouth."

Mike: “Yeah, but ya know, this is
still the most fun I've had in three
years."

Stu: “The first year we were pop-
ping Rolaids. Now I sweat, but ljust

before going on." .
’ Dave: "The audience seemed to
respond well.” ‘

Stu: “They really did. Then again,

‘ all I used to play were Jewish oldage
homes where the people dribbled,
singing along with ‘Hava Nagila’.”

Dave left to go out into the
audience, but Mike and Stu Were go-
ing orragain at 3:30, so they remain-
ed in the lounge. This time they
would play with some friends who
needed vocal and guitar help. “Their
guitar player retired to become a
jockey up at Saratoga,” said Stu.

When the timearrived, only about
60 remained in the audience. barely
enough for pie-throwing collections,-
which had been gathering in hun-
dreds of dollars a few hours before.

Stu and Mike were to sit on the
edge of the stage for the two
numbers. Three singers and a
pianist—Stu's friend. Ira—were
placed behind them.

“We only got one mike. Stu," said
Mike, before going on. “We're going
to have to look at each other."

Stu: “We don‘t know the chords so
we haveto look at each other. But we
might not be able to hear lra where
we are.”

Mike: “We might be better off.
Besides, i like it better off the stage.
We're not as exposed.“

The selections, “You're l6” and
“Day by Day", were sung by the

group's regulars, while Stu and Mike ,

offered sporadic accompaniment.
Once again, the boys trod off
backstage.
Stu: “I couldn't even hear. It was
like playing in a phone booth."
Mike: “What was the tempo? l was

watching your hand and couldn’t get
the tempo."

Stu: “That‘s because I stopped
playing. I was trying to ﬁgure out
how I‘d sing it. All I'd hear waslra
tinkering a lot."

Back in the lounge, Dave awaited
them with a smile on his face. “Hey

guys. good news," he said. “your '

mikes went off half-way through."
The next time they played would
be 7:30 a.m. so the three went back
:into the audience. They werejoincd
there by some friends and Slu’s

girlfriend Cathy. 'Can I ask you if
‘Tin Town' was supposed to last that
long, Stu?," she asked.

“We did every verse once. lthink,"
he replied.

"Oh." she hesitated, “but it seemed
so much longerthan it usually does.“

Up onstage, three guitarists were
doing a professional job on a couple
of Beatle's numbers. “That‘s Hector
on the left and John Simpson in the
middle," noted Mike. “They‘re
number one and two on the
coffeehouse circuit. I don‘t knowthc

other guy. but he sounds great, too."

"Those guys hear all the bar-
monies when they play,“ Stu added.
“We run into the harmonies once in it
while by accident."

Hours passed. and most of the
other entertainers went home to her!
late. The donation board, which
earlier had gained hundreds by the
hour. began to move by tens and
ﬁnally by ones. The three friends
remained, however. and at 5:30.
Mike even ctr-hosted for rtn hour
wrth apartment-mate Gary Pollack.

Retarded Remain in Background of Festivities

by Paul Pelagalll

The Eighth Annual Telethon for
the Wiklwood School for mentally
disabled children was a great
success. The sum of “5,000 which
was raised will deﬁnitely be ap-
preciated by the Wildwood School.
At the same time, a good part of the
student population and the com-
munity enjoyed themselves as
students and faculty performed and
were creamed by pics.

This all raisesone importantques-
tion: How many people were aware
who their donations help? Many of
the M.C.‘s spoke of how the school
helps developmentally handicapped
children. The information sheet that
each pair of M.C.‘s received referred
to the children as brain unjured and
autistic. However, these are phrases
which it is believed the public would
rather not hear. Too depressing,

So Telethon goes on and money is
raised while we all have a good time.
Yet some [ people bid at the auctions
as if it were a place to try to get a

good deal. A $20 gift certificate was
sold for less than $l0. lfthe bidders
were out for a bargain why didn't
they offer at least SIS. lf bought for
its full price, the purchaser doesn't
lose anything because he has to buy
groceries eventually.

Another gift certiﬁcate, for the
Lady Madonna Boutique, was sold
for $2: it was worth SID. I suppose
not too many of the people in the
audience were pregnant, but it could
be used as a present for a friend.

flat the whole point is that the-
Telethon is for a good cause and too
few people realize it. This ignorance
on the part of those who attend thc
festivities is due to the burying ofthe
fact that the children who will
benefit by the proceeds are mentally
ill. Some cart be referred to as rcttrrd-
cd. but retardation is a word that is

taboo.

Perhaps if the mental and physical
handicaps of these. children were
spoken of rind shown to the audience
the party atmosphere of Telethon

wouldn't be the dominant feeling
which pervades the ballroom. It
might be somewhat depressing to
have one of the severely retarded
children on stage but it might also
motivate a few people to part with
their money more readily. it may
even make someone realize that
brain damaged children are real peo-
ple. if one has not been exposed to
mental and physical abnormalities

will leave the weaker of us with a
queasy feeling.

pretty white so there's a lot that‘t un~

Telethon is a wonderful thing to
have and everyone who is involved itt
it in any way should he cott-
gratulated. Still, it seems that iti
some ways the whole thing misses
the point.

Raising funds for the Wildwootl
School is the major goal of"l‘clcr|itrn.
Maybe sometime in the fur'turc our:
of the purposcsof'l'clethon will bc to
make the community and the fin-
ivcrsity aware of the fact that brunt
damaged and autistic children
aren't the monstrous atrocities th.tt
we make them out to be.

The discussion session had ended.
Instantly professors and other in-
tellegentsia flocked to speaker,
Noam Chomsky as eager students
might towards an admired teacher.

Noam Chomsky, a controversial
personality in both the study of
language, and in New Left politics
addressed excited audiences at a dis-
cussion and lecture this past Mon-
dtiy. Chomsky is known for his
revolutionized theory of linguistics
which proposes an innate capacity
for the knowlch of language. As a
New Leftist Chomsky has written
numerous books, some exposing
government tactics and propaganda.
He has also participated zirdcntly in
the Vietnam anti-war protest.

“Language is basically an organ of
the body.“ stated Chomsky in
describing the genetic basis for the
knowledge of language. The
evidence for this theory, he noted.
was that all languages exhibit the
same fundamental qualities. He cor-
responded his theory to the study of
heredity whcrc scientist knew that
there was some controlling factor so
they labeled it a gene. In a similar
sense, Chomsky feels that there is an
inborn knowledge of language and
he terms it "competence." “It is ccr—
ttiin that some rules are learned.“
noted Chomsky, but “Most of it is
prcprogrtimmcd."

Chomsky also stated, “There is no
such thing as a theory of learning."

He feels that there cannot be one
generalized theory to account for the
diverse areas of man‘s knowledge or
competence. ‘

Dressed conservatively in a cor-
duoroy sportsjacket, grey slacksand
Wallabces, Chomsky addressed his
audience in a relaxed and unpreten-
tious tone. Commenting on the issue
of freedom of the press. Chomsky
smiled as he often did throughout
the discussion, and said, restrictions
on publication result from an in-
tcllcgcntsia who control the press.
He also noted what he described as
an “ideological bias of the press,“
citing that the press takes for granted
that the state will use repression
against dissent. Therefore. he added,
little is printed about such abuses by
the government its the FBI disrup-
tion of the leftist peace movsmcnt.

He then referred to the secret
bombing ofCanibodia, stating “The
press and Congress decided to make
it it sccrct bombing. . .they kncw
everything from the beginning but
chose to censor it.“0ncc it was,as he
termed it, “open season on Nixon“,
then everything was revealed.

At the discussion session, the
topics jumped periodically from
ligiiistics to politics and then to
linguistics again. Chomsky denied
the scientific nature ofSkinncr's ap-
proach to psychology. According to
Chomsky. Skinner feels it is
"illegitimate to discuss internal
states.“ th science is the studyof in-
ternal states, he noted.

President Ford's conditional
amnest was discussed in an interka
between this reporter and Chomsky.
Chomsky believes that there is no
need for amnesty for deserters and
daft evaders for they were only doing
what they thought was right.
However, he noted, “There should
be amnesty for the Kissingcrs."

In regard to change in America,
Chomsky said that in order for
change to occur, the imperialistic
nature of the U.S. would have to be
altered. In addition. hcr felt that the
responsibility for change should not
rest upon students who. holding lln
uncertain titid insecure position in
