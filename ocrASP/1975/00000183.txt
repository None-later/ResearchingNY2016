go into making a very dramatic ac-

daring and successful in part because
of the orchestration of various

effective "and so» was the power
generated at the monsterous climac-
tic moments.

Pianist Andrew Wolf closed the
program with Brahms‘ Piano Con-
certo No. 2. He is a young and
energetic performer. as exciting to
watch as he is to hear. Wolf’s concen-
tration is total while he is playing. He
puts a great deal of effort into each
note and phrase. What comes out is
thoroughly musical and thoroughly
enjoyable.

The role of the orchestra in the
Brahms piece is more extensive than
one finds in most concerti. Again the
orchestra handled their part quite
professionally.

The Albany Symphony is always
growing and concerts like the on:
this weekend are a good indication
of this. Along with the orchestra. the
audience must also grow. both in size
and awareness. During the intermis-
sion, there were a number of
negative comments about the Parris
piece. These did not come from in-'
dividuals who were making a.
musical judgement, but rather in-'
dividuals who were making an.
usthetic judgement simply because
they did not 'know any better.
Another possibility is that they
automatically turn off to modern
music regardless of how good it is.
The Albany Symphony is slowly
and quietly making its way to the
top. It is a great challenge each step
of the way. lfthis weekend is any in-
dication. they are well ontheir way.

She had before sought the end
but you could not call her coward.
Though she'd been to bedlam.
and part way back.

you could not call her crazy
(unless uncovering perfect visions

She had. you see, achieved the interface

at which life kisses death

and with all her poet‘s courage
peered into that hole.

that gaping invitation

more seductive than a lover.

The only architect of her dreams
she arose to still her voice.

No return from this.

This was not like laryngitis.

All things do relum

from bone to dust . . . . .

If you. just for a moment
considered Berryman‘s world.

Do not hypocrite freedom:
one‘s life is

to blow the candle out.

and Berryman‘s life. you see.

he saw the darkness

and resided in its palm.

would be lunacy—

M ” the In; A dvertising

“Mythl in advertising? suggests perhaps most readily that advertisers
exaggerate or distort the quality of their services of products. To readers or
this column the phrase will suggest also the frequent commercial “I; or
themes and names from classical mythology.

The automobile business provides several examples. The Ford Motor Co.
Probably named a line of cars after Mercury because the name implies speed.
Atlas. who bears the vault of heaven on his shoulders, is a symbol of strength.

i and undoubtedly Atlas tires and batteries are supposed to be especially

mung, King Midas had "the golden touch," and mufﬂers and other parts

installed by the Midas Shops are golden in color. In the Buick line of cars

there has always been Electra, and now there is an Apollo; the reason for the
choice of these two names is less apparent. The Volkswagen people several
months ago had a television commercial in which the gods of Mt. Olympus
admire Volkwagon cars, of course, and in which Hermes, using his caduceus
like magic wand, transforms a sumplc Beetle into a fancy Love-Bug.

Hermes, or Mercury, also was chosen for the trademark of the Florisvs
Transworld Delivery, and again the customer is to be impressed by speed.
Argus was a hundred-eyed monster who never closed all of his eyes at is same
time, and now We have Argus cameras. Hercules. representing strength. is a
good name for a company which produces powder and explosives. Neptune
for outboard motors is not surprising. and neither is Vulcan for boilers and
steers. 0n the other hand one wonders why the ﬁgure of Atlas was adopted
by the European Health Spas. Would not Aphrodite of Hygeia have been
more appropriate?

Mythological names are popular in the publishing business. There are
publishing ﬁrms or book series by the following names: Apollo, Ares. Argo.
Argonaut, Argus. Ariadne. Athena. Aurora, Helios, Hermes. Jupiter.
Mercury, Minerva. Odyssey. Prometheus. Tiresias, and Zeus. Periodicals.
especially in the ﬁeld of literature. are apt to use mythological names: Apollo.
Arethusa. Athena. Dioniso. lo. Hermes. Phoebus. Phoenix. Poseidon. and
Sibyl.

Sometimes names are chosen. it seems. at random. for their place in an
alphabetical listing. or for their sound, rather than for a specific association
with the product. An amazing variety of products are being marketed under
such names as Ajax. Phoenix. or Zephyr. There are Argonaut ﬂoor tiles and
Hercules shoe laces. Latin names seem to be more attractive than their Greek

equivalents.

of the principles of the Baha‘i Faith.

The story took place at a Unity
Day Picnic. a day designated for the
purpose of kindling an atmosphere
of love. altruism and friendship. No
such thing occurred. Instead. com-
plaints against the misuse of power.
materialism. revolution. rejudice
and deception permeated every type
of activity that took place. Teh solu-
tion at hand was to forget it all and
party.

The heroine of the story. a
character named Sarah. wasatypical
ol' the crowd. She was unable to
relate to the prevailing atmosphere
of gaiety. and her ambivalent at-
titude was utilized as a means to ex-
pose the life and writings of
Buhu‘U‘lltth. The Founder of the
Baha‘i Faith.

it is important to point out that
not all of the members of the Crystal
'l'hcnlrc are Btiha‘is. We happened to
speak to two who were. One oflhem,
an architect with a Catholic
background. expressed the opinion
that most of the Baha‘i priciplcs were

similar to Judeo-Christian Ethics.
He emphasized the belief in a abasic
education for all children. equality
of sexes. the need to abolish ex-
tremes in economic status and the
idea of unity via diversity. The
Baha‘is. in addition. have no
priesthood. have high moral stan-
dards. and believe that Baha‘U’llah
is the most recent manifesliation of a
siglc (i-d. In addition. it was stated
that Baha‘i Faith will succeed its pur-
pose when everyone is a Baha'i and
thinks along "the same spiritqu
lines." There will be no disharmony
in leadership. and everyone will
agree on all decisions When con-
l'roned with dilemma as to how
everyone could be the same and yet
unique simultaneously. we received
it mlhcranbiguous reply: “It will be.“

Unity Day Picnic

Undoubtedly. the Baha'is attest to
some very Utopian ideals. but in a
world ﬁlled with chaos and corrup-
tion. that attiludc cannot be con-
demned. The question that must be
posed is: con il work?
