An Interview with
ACT Coordinator
David Abramoff

by D. Gaines

ASP: What is the philosophy
behind ACT?

ABRAMOI’F: The fundamental
philosophy is to use ACT to help
make SUNYA a better aritl more
respotiisve school. ACT ac-
complisltcs this by providing useful
information to our univerity‘s three
major groups: students. faculty, and
atlministnttion. We want to avoid
ACT becoming it scandal sheet. We
do not edit our results. We have
great confidence that anyone who
sits down with an ACT. reads the
forward and explanation of our
evaluation system. and spends some
time witlrit. and leania tremendous
amount of information. the infor-
mation AC'l’ provides can help all
three groups improve teaching quali-

l .

/lSI’: lit \vlittt waywill ACT improve
teaching quality“.l

ABR/tMOFF: This cart he ac—
complished in many ways. One is by
allowing students to choose courses
with more information than just the
teacher's name and what time the
class meets. Over a period of time
this will allow students to itidicate by
enrollment statistics that they will
not settle for poor teaching quality,
Over a series of ACT‘s there should
he an indication of which type of
cotrrscaprofessorperforms best in. I
am referring to the fact that teacher \
excel in particular fields: some
teachers are best in small courses.
others are best iii large lL'L'llll'L'
classes. Some teachers are best or iii—
tro level courses \vhile tilltcts .rt
speciali/cd courses. the particular
combinations between courses and
faculty that work best cart be seen |r_\
using r\(“| in conjunction with all
past editions. to take a course “Hit
the wrong teacher not only doesn't
rriake sense bill is an educational
waste.

Another way AC'l‘ liclps. is allott-
ittg the faculty to see themselves and
their fellow faculty members in the
eyes of their students. the book
should be thought of as a construc-
tive evaluation of particular
weaknesses and strongpoirits within
any particular course or professor.

The third way is that it helps the
University deal directly with the
professors. Hopefully. incompetent
teachers will be required to improve
ASP: How‘s the issue with the ad-

 

ministrators‘!

AIlR/frlIUI-‘I’: The administration
attitude has been \ery liclpftil. I
think they were surprised about how
quickly we got off the ground and
that we had so much success with
faculty response. since faculty par-
ticipation is only voluntary. l'hcad-
ministration supports AC’I‘ and
would like to see it continue and
grow. It rccogrii/es It's importance to

ABRA MOFF: Published teacher
evaluations have long been 
beneﬁcially at other schools. such as
the Ivy league schools. Our ACT
began last year. when I met with the
then Student Association President
Steve Gerber. and told him that I felt
the students here were hurting badly
by irot havinga published evaluation
book. He agreed and helped me to
obtain funding frorn the Student
Association for what was to become
ACT. The style ofthe book is unique
to Albany. the computer system.
written by two computer science
students Mark (irccnbcrgatrd Steve
Pollack. allows its to print 20.000
different responses quickly and ac-
cttratcly.

.AtSI’: So Mark and Steve set tip the
program. How does it work‘!

Departments that used ACT ex-

weeks before prc-registration.
.IISI’: You mentioned that some
departments used ACT exclusively;
what are tltesc departments?
Alf/MrlHH-‘I’: Four departments
replaced their evaluation form with
ours; Philosophy. Math. Computer
Science, and Biology. At least eiyit
other departments helped its witlt

didn't cooperate. this \i. try students

reasons particular professors are riot

.tSI’: How did you distribute the
first book?

’l/fRJJIU/rl‘i.‘ Wt: charged 25: to
student taxpayers and 75: to tion-
taitpayers. and gtnc professors ad-
ministrators and ACI volunteers a
free copy. The pholosophy behind
the free copy was to build a positive
AC|'-Faculty relationship for the
future. We'd like the faculty and ad-
ministration to use ACT and Learn
from it. It is a student service to the
rest of the campus.

ASP: How many students do you
have on the staff!

AIIRA MOH‘: We have a core staff
of 8 or 9 people who do a vast
percentage of the work. In addition
to them we get help fromsome ofthe
academic clrbs, such as Hebrew
Club. Chinese Club. Delta Sigma Pi
the Business fratcmityand Beta Beta
Beta the Biology organization. Also.
of course. we have the help ofaboul
ISO other students working to see
AC'I continue and improve.

ABRA MUFF: ACT is a young
publication and although I am
satisﬁed with our progress I realize
there are still weaknesses. As Imcn-
tinned before we would like. where
necessary. to try to supplement our
questionnaire. which has. incidental—
ly. been strongly supported around
the campus. with four questionsthat
may better key into the speciﬁc
dcpa nment. Also where ACT is used
departmentally. we plan to have a
page for written comments for the
department to file and return a copy
of the comments after the end ofthe
semester to the respective professors.
Another problem is that for many
users AC‘I‘ does not have all the
classes and instructors they want in-
formation about. I feel confident
that for this semester. if we can con-
tintte to attract volunteers. we will be
able tti evaluate all classes with the
exception of the 30—40 teacher
relusals. Remember that we only
evaluate undergraduate classes and
that approximately l5"; ofthe faculv
I) does not return each year.

AC is method of publication is a bit
difficult to understand. and we
rcali/c that statistics caritiot provide
a total picture. However. there are
many corriplexities involved in corti-
pilirrg 20.000 different answer sheets
containing 20 ansucrs apiece. We
felt it important to providethc exact
breakdown (how tnany A's. ll‘s etc.)
of responses on eaclt of the 20
questions. As we continue to work
out our kinks we plan on someday
providing more information in
ACT. Some idtxts we're working
with include the professor‘s descrip-
tion of his evaluated class. an up-
dated description of how next
semester‘s course will be taught as to
objectives. grading policy. and text-
boods. a statement from department
chairmen about department
offerings. and student‘s written com-
ments about the class and evaluated
professor.

xlSl’: Where can students go if
they'd like to help ACT?

pus Centcr It] right near the en-
trance to the pool room. and our
