that a Boston» man has suddenly

begun to grow bright green hair on ‘

_ his head, but that no one can explain
why. .

Doctors Lewis Holmes and'

Lowell Goldsmith. working outIof
the Massachusetts General Hospital,

say the green hair has been cropping '

up in various shades all over the
Scalp of a Sl-year-old-rnan. -

.The doctors state they subjected

the man's hairs to every known

' microscopic and chemical test in an

effort to discover the cause of the

bizarre hair coloring. They report;

however. they can ﬁnd no reason

why the man's hair would tum stich
an odd color. but that the green hair

is “really uite striking."

The “Committee to End Pay
Toilets in America” has won another
significant victory.

The national organiration which
mils itself “CEPTIA”. reports that
pay stalls in the state of lowa have
been "liberated."

it happened when the [own House

of Representatives voted this week.
80 to Is. to outlaw all pay toilets in
public places in Iowa. The puyjohns
were banned despite the fact that
pay-toilet-makers passed out
pamphlets to lawmakers which
quoted |00 satisﬁed customers.

CEPTIA claims that pay stallsnrc
“degrading” and are sexist as well. It
charges that pay toilets are unfair to
women because men are never sub-
jected to “pay urinals."

CEPTlA. which boasts 1600
members nationwide. estimates
there are 50.000 pay toilets in the
U.S. grossing an incredible $30
million a year.

Soxorclst

The Brazil Hera/Ll is out with a
strange report about a showing of
the movie “The Exorcist“ in Rio de
Janiero.

During a recent screening of the
flint at the La l’ampu Theatre. one of
thevscencs was interrupted by a large
brown rat that scurried across the
stage. The intrusion entirely dis-
tracted the audience's attention. and
when usherette Yuma Gomez
appeared on stage with a mop to at-
tack the rat. the audience chanted,
"Take them off. Take them off."

The newspaper said the usherette
did not realize the audience wanted
her and the rat off-stage. instead.
when she finished clubbing the rat.
she proceeded to oblige the crowd by
taking off her clothes. and dancing
naked in front of the screen.

The theatre was soon cleared by
armed guards. The Herald quotes
Go‘ptez as saying afterwards: “As the
shouting continued after i got the
rat. I thought the audience was call-

‘ Sealed Homes

A lawyer for a Canadian lead
smelting company has come up with
a novel solution to industrial air
pollution. .

Attorney lan Outerbridge
suggests that tall city apartment
towers should be built absolutely air

, tight so that polluted air outside can-

not get inside the building. What‘s
more. says Outerbridge. modern
apartments should not have
balconies on them since balconies
would simply encourage people to
step outside into foul air.

Outerbridge offered his
suggestions while representing
Toronto refiners and smelters
limited during air pollution hearings
in Toronto.

The attorney said that sealed-in
buildings could be provided with air
through special filtering systems.
Earlier in the hearings. Outerbridge
also suggested that children who live
near lead smelting plants have high
levels of lead in their blood because
they might have been eating paint.

Free S

Thc government may be giving
seeds away this spring.

A bill providing three packets of
free seeds to each American family
was squelched by the House Ap-
propriations Committee last year.
However. Pacific News Service
reports that this year. with the price
of seeds up 25 percent. Congress may
just pass the “free seed law."

The seed give-away is not a new
idea. For almost a century. between
l839 and 1923. the U.S. government
gave free seeds to citizens who asked
for them. The need may be large:

Prison Phone Phrooks

“Phone Phreaks" are now
operating inside California's
prisons.

The Los-Angeles Sheriff‘s Depart-
ment reports that three prisoners in
the maximum facility at Wayside
Honor Rancho have been busted on
charges of making long-distance
calls using counterfeit credit card

' numbers.

The three inmates are accused of
using a prison pay phone to run up
about $600 in phone bills charged to
other person’s credit cards. One of
the inmated charged all his calls to
the Chino Municipal Court. Prison
officials report that adozcn other in-
mates are suspects in the Phone

Phreak ring. mic. .. .

In the meantime. the Sheriff‘s
Department says that prisoners have
been abusing their pay phone
privileges in other ways. Deputies
say that one inmate used the phone
to telephone Washington and to talk
to Supreme Court Justice William
0. Douglas personally.

Another inmate. the Department
reports. was using the prison phone
to talk to friends on the outside to
plan robberies. That inmate even-
tually got a wrong number and end-
ed up calling a police lieutenant by
mistake: Sheriffs say that was the
end of the robbe scheme.

Golf Ball iio Hooker

'l‘wo Califomiu inventors may
have revolutionized golf. They claim
to have designed a golf ball that will
neither hook nor slice.

Physicist Fred Holmstrom and
chemist Daniel Nepelu. both of San
Jose. have redesigned the golfball by
removing somc ofdimples on its stir-

I

face. They have also distributed its,

weight a bit differently, but they say _

their new ball meets every strict re-

quirement of the United States Golf '

Association.

Their tests, they say, show that the
ball travels about as far as the stan-
dard golf ball. yet reduces hooksand
slices by 80per cent.'l‘hcy call their
invention the "Happy N'on-
Hooker.“

Paw Reading

You’ve all heard about palm
reading.

Well. a London mystic reports she
can predict the futures of pet cats
and dogs by practicing “paw
reading."

Magenta Wise of Brighton says
she established her “Animal Clair-
voyant Consultancy" when she
noticed that an animal's paw
revealed just as much about their
futures as human hands do about
people.

Wise reports that a broad paw
generally means the animal is ex-
trovcrtcd. while a pinched paw is a

 that the dog or cat is lip-tight

and inhibited. 

Bootleg Homework

A San Diego disk jockey has
become a smash success overnight
by bootlegging—not beer. records or
drugs—but "homework".

Each weeknight, students from
about 20 high schools in the San
Diego area can tune in to DOB and
hear disc jockey Larry (The Cruiser)
Himmel answer some of their
homework assignments. Himmel

says lte has about 45 student “cun-
tncts“ from various high schools who
supply him with answers to
hochork problems. He then
broadcasts the “homework” over the
air. in between cuts ol~ rock and roll
music.
