Telethon hasonce- again reached‘a successful close and once again it is due to the
hard work and generosity of the students and members of the administration. The
money raised 'forvthe Wildwood Schoolwill enablemore handicappedchildrento reach
theirgreatest potential asindividuals. Anyone present during the-24 hours could feel the
love and gratitude of the children and parents for our attempts to help.

This statement is directed toward the faculty: In a university communityofthissize it

is both surprising and abhorent that Telethon received a total lack of support from .

them. Except for those few'professors who agreed to take a pie in the face for the sake
of hihrity,there wasn‘t one faculty member present'during the 24 hours. ‘

At thispointin the development of our university, it is important that we achieve a
sense of.unity. The students and the faculty are not two alien and divided factions nor
should they be. We have tied onceagain',and we have failed. if the faculty is unable to
respond to the students in the name of charity. thenthereare few avenues left open to us.
The onus for action now lies with the faculty.

Times and Places

Last‘Monday sign-up began for special “quiet” residence balls on campus. The
dorms are Pierce Hall downtown. and ﬂoors‘ 6through 21 in Stuyvesant Tower. These
dorms will house next year, if there is any interest in them, students who are
academically oriented and who want a quiet studious atmosphere.

All this sounds well and good, but there are some issues involvedthat need
clarification.

College is more than a place to study, read books, and take exams. The essence of
college life is learning, but it's learning more than what's written in books. lt‘s learning
to interact with other people, it’s learning about yourself, it's learning to be a person.
That may take staying up all night drinking, or partying, and running through the halls

screaming, now and then. The people will live in these quiet dorms will he depriving

themselves of many of the experiences that make up the total college experience.
Of course there are students who are involved in their studies, but there are times

and places at this University where schoolwork can beuursued without distractions.
The proposal for quiet dorms envision town hall meetings to establish policy, and

enforcement of guidelines set on the “academic atmosphere.“ Punishment for

breaking these rules could lead to expulsion from those dorms. Although that is a "

remote possibility, the implications are disturbing.

Kick and Humor

Humor is a difficult thing to understand. The reasons one person has for laughing
might make someone else cry, or have no effect at all. Most humor is based on someone
else‘smisfortune, like when someone jumps off a building into a truekfull of bananas or
when a prisoners gun which was made gut of soap begins to wash hishands. Today‘s
K ick-Irt- The-ASP, an early celebration of April Fool‘s Day, has some of that humor in
ll.

Satireandsubtle inconsistency are considered a more sophisticated kind of humor.
This is when a situation is presented that is close to reality but has some bizarre or
absurd twists. A version of these kinds ofjokes is thejokcs one thinks is real, when, for
example, one‘s brother comes in to say that school is canceled or what happened when
Orson Wells put on his radio show War of the Worlds about forty years ago.

A more controversial form but probath more wide-spread than any of these is
“dirty” humor. that is, jokes about sex, excretion, death and other subjects usually
found disgusting. Obscnity is especially provcative because it has been in conflict with
the FirstAmendmcntfor years. While it us disturbing to many people, obsenityis also
very funny to others. Some l'tnd obsentiy the only subject worth laughing about.

Yet, the only reason we laugh at obscenity is because its so shocking to some people.
We laugh in shock or to cover embarrassment. There are elements of misfortune in this
humor. like on the Kick Preview page, but the key element of its success is its shock
value.

Today‘s Kick has all kinds of humor in it. and few enjoy all kinds of humor. Some
will be offended. some bored, some pleased, and some hysterical, but. in any case, we
hope you enjoy today‘s Kick insert.

Of Pterosours and SST's

 

Last week it was reported that scientists in
West Texas discovered the skeletal remains of
the largest ﬂying creature ever known .

Dubbed the Texas ptcrosaur (ptcron, wing;
sauros, lizard), the creature livcd more than 60
million years ago and had a wing span of5l
feet~-—Iargcr than the F-4 jet ﬁghter plane.
Scientists think it may have fed on dead
dinosaurs, an idea suggested by its long neck
enabling pterosaur to probe large carcasses.

The story made me think ofa'future report,
likely to be read in newspapers of the day
millions of ycars from now. It will probably
go like this:

Scientists dredging Long Island Sound
today discovered the remains of what is
thought to he the largest ﬂying object in
earth's history. The letters SST, dimmed but
discernible, appeared on the object's trunk,
and experts tentatively suggest they may stand
for Supersonic Transport, a kind of
enormous, unwieldy ﬂying objcclthoughtto
have been the pet project of a small but
powerful and stubborn group ofearly human
beings.

“Indications are the object only flew a few
times," said Nobel Prize winner Thor Aviar,
director of the World Anthropological
Society. “We know from ancient records
found in an important capital city of that era
that efforts to produce the SST brought near
economic ruin to what was then known as
Western Civilization.

“And we can tell from the object's stomach
that it would have consumed energy at an
enormous rate. The world was hit by a

y Ron "entire" ,
ravaging fuel crisis at about this period the)
used gasoline at the timer—so it was hit-l}
impossible for these early human». to htft'p
these objects off the ground forany lungthol
time."

Scientists in Europe, however, dipuml thn
theory late today. They claim to have lound
ancient newspaper accounts in an .tt'cn
thought to have been called Paris at tln- tour
which reveal that an SS'I' called t'om-oxdt-
received permission to land in many countt to.
including, in the late l900's,a nllllttll L'ilIIL'tI IIlL'
United States.

Aviar alsopointcobut that it' only one oi tltc
things had flown even a few times ll would
have permanently damaged lIlL‘ uttpL‘l
atmosphere in ways that would he \‘lxlI‘lIct'lt-‘ll
today. There are no such indications. hu \dld

Apor Bttnchir. vice chaircnrthling ot UN
World Historical lnstiturc, supported AHAHK
thesis, bttt added that he doubted the itllt‘lL‘lll
fuel crisis or noise pollution had much to do
with the SST's grounding. “lly all accounts.
humans at that time had no understanding oi
conservation and little appreciation ot min."
llanchir said. "If they had the tccltnttlog) |“
make it, they would haVe ﬂown it, unless II”) in
one of those rare occasions when it it“
exceptionally advanced humans may haw
been able to stand firm enough to prohlhtI lh“
object's production.

Thus it is thought that this may prove to M
the first recorded instance of early human
beings acting responsibly toward IIIL'”
environment. "If so, the SST find is historIL'.
indeed," Banchir said.

Gem
of the
Mediterranean

To the Edltor:

I would like to openly commend Paul
Koine‘s article in the ASP of Feb. 25, I915,
entitled “Cyprus After War.” While offering
us a complete and truthful overview of the
Cyprus situation, he remained unbiased and
withheld his emotions; and this is very difﬁcult
for a Greek to do.

Being currently involved with the
movement active in seeking to gain a fair
settlement in Cyprus, which is based in New
York City, I have been appalled by the stand
taken by Ford and Kissinger in the name of the
American people. The State Department and
C.l.A. collaborators not only planned and
engineered the invasion of Cyprus by Turkish
troops armed with sophisticated U.S.
weapons, but presently persist in their support
of the invading barbarians by refusing to
convince them to come to terms with the
Greek Cypriote majority at the conference
table. Meanwhile, 250,000 refugees wait,
homeless, for some sign of relief towards their
innocent suffering. One could go on and on
about this culpable U.S. Administration, but
knowing that one day these murderers will be
brought to justice by decent and democratic
citizens, our present time could be better
spent.

It is imperative that all freedom-loving
students at Albany State write their legislators
requesting the continuation ofthe embargo on
arms to Turkey, and that immediate relief
measures be taken to alleviate some of the
immense burdens of the Cypriote nation and
people. Our congress has indeed shown some
sense of ltumanity and benevolence in their
actions to date on the Cyprus issue, and it is
important to remind them that Cyprus will
never be forgotten by Americans, and that she
will oncday riscagain to resumehcr role as the
gem of the Mediterranean,

Classroom Ethics

To the Editor:

Friday, March 7, Eugene McCarthy spoke
to our class, American Studies 1009. during
the regularly scheduled class time l:l0-2:00
pm. The class had been informed that
McCarthy would speak on “Hctly Friedan‘s

On Ma'rdr‘l. McCarthy appeared before
our class and‘proceeded to give a campaign
speech mpporting his announced candidacy
for President is 21976. He elarlystatedln his
opening comments that he did not intend to

speak on the Friedan topic. although Dr. J.G. . .

Barker-Benl'teld, who ‘had arranged to have
him come, had made it appear that this was
what he had agreed to speak on. McCarthy
said that he had not agreed to this topic and
had not come to SUNYA to speak on this
topic.

We wish to protest our class beingused as a
platform for political campaigning. We
understand that Eugene McCarthy received a
large fee—which was paid out of University
funds—to deliver his political campaign
speech to our class. We object to University
funds being used to support one candidate
unless all other candidates are similarly
supported.

Moreover. we question if , Eugene
McCarthy was the appropriate speaker to
bring in‘to speak to the class on sex role
identity. He has hardly distinguished himself
as a scholar in this area, while there are many
other women“ and men who have, who it
seems would have been much more
appropriate choices. We cannot help but think
that he was brought to the University under
the pretext ofspcaking to ourclass for the sake
of offering him politirml support inthe form of
money and publicity. This objective is strongly
suggested in that the publicity poster that were
printed up by the American Studies
Program regarding his talk to our class
identified him as: “Eugene J. McCarthy,
Independent Candidate for President in
l976."

We think that this matter should bo of
serious conccm to the University in view of its
requirement to remain non-partisan at all
times. I V.’

Faculty Faulted

To the Editor:

On behalf of Ernie Sprancc and myself, I
would like to take this opportunity to thank
the students and ad ministration for their help
andl‘mancialsuppotj in making Telethon '75 a
fabulous success. I hope that they are already
aware of our deep and sincere gratitude.

I would also like to take this opportunity to
express my discouragement. disillusionment
and dissatisfaction with the members of the
faculty. Once again it has been made evident
that notonlyare they ignorant of any student
related functions but that they choose to
remain so.

A lcw months ago, Telethon sent a letter to
the chairman of cacti academic department on

From the Frog's Mouth

 

by Gene Carragee

The underlying health of any nation can be
determined by the state of its communications
and transit systems. The onset of the energy
crisis has seriously endangered that pillar of
American transportation, the automobile.
Large scale transport of freight by trucks has
become less and less proﬁtable; and we all
have seen the steady increase of public bus
fares. Air transit has the built-in restriction of

very high fuel cost pcr.wcight "WWWAL.

maximum capacity air travel is much less
efficient. fuel-wise, than the automobile.

It has become increasingly apparent that the
nation needs a new type of transit system. The
system should provide quick transportation
for both freight and passengers over long
distances; it should have a small land usage
area (the American landscape has seen enough
four lane highways). Finally, and most
importantly it should have a high fuel
efficiency. As it turns out, this "new" form of
transportation is older than the automobile
and much older than the airplane: it is the
railroad.

If his possible to disconnect the theory of
rail travel from it's old image: that of a
disastcrously mismanaged institution that
until recently has been disappearing from the
American landscape, it can be seen that
railroads offer a far more practical and
economical system of transportation than can
be offered by the automobile.

The central problem facing the railroads is
the large amounts of capital that is necessary
to expand and update its services. For so many
years it seemed certain the railroads were

doomed to fall before the almighty “American
Frankenstein“ from Detroit. Railroad
investors were rightfully wary of investing in a
lost cause. Asa result the lines fell into a pitiful
state of disrepair. and the systems potential
efficiency has been lost to rotting rails and
antiquated cars.

Environmental groups have, since I972,
lobbied vigorously for the rcappropriation of
funds from the highway trust fund to mass

.transitf’uses. In l97l, the semi-public

“National Railroad Passenger Company."
Amtrak, was created by Congress. Despite the
fears of commercial bus companies. most of
the passengers were drawn from their cars
rather than buses. Government subsidy of the
railroads. especially Amtrak, at least for a few
years, is a necessity. Until the efﬁciency of the
service is built to its potential, railroads are
not“ likely to bc a very lucrative operation;
however, it is imperative that America begin
to redevelop its railroads ifit does not want to
bc choked to death by automobiles and
highways.

As alluded to before. efﬁcient transit is a
key toprosperity. Ancient Rome‘s grandeur
has to a large extent been attributed to an
amazingly comprehensive syustem of
skillfully built roadways. Caesar was able to
travel with his legions eight hundred miles in
eight days! Roads were built efﬁciently, and
more importantly, they were built to last -two
thousand years if necessary. In the United
States. too much interest is given to immediate
profit frrom our endeavors. Railroads will not
be immediately proﬁtable; however, by most
accounts they are the long range answer.
