Orleans. a band of four brilliantly
talented musicians; has just released
their third album. This new one is
titled:“Let There Be Music“ is on
Elektra/Asylum Records.

When I listened to the album the
ﬁrst time I was'impressed with the
beautiful four-part harmony they
sang throughout the album. But.
many bands can sound really tight
on records and actually be mediocre
musicians; so I originally grouped
Orleans with what I call the “studio
bands,“ or bands which sound good
after ﬁfty takes in the studio. butjust
can't put it together in concert. BUT.
this thought could not be farther
from the truth! (as one thousand
people will attest to who witnessed
the Orleans explosion at Union
College Chapel last month). this
band is as tight and impressive in
concert as they are on all their
albums!

They literally electrified the crowd
there for three hours. And that elec-
tricity is also present in similar quan-

tity on the new album. From start to -

ﬁnish this album is full of four
beautifully blending. well-arranged
voices backed up by a sound which
varies from easy-listening soft rock
to reggae to funky"'dbubIe-lead
guitars. 

As you progress through the.

album you hear examples of funky
dance stuff; some lyrical love' songs
(which show off thc‘bcautiful four
part voice arrangements) and some

genuinely good easy-listening laid-
back roclt.~Also. there‘s a reggae
tune on the album but in my opinion
this is‘ not the best example of their
facility for the Jamacian music.
since their other albums contain
much better reggae tunes; however,
in general the music types are varied
just enough to hold your interest all
the way through the album. The
songs don‘t bore you by all sounding
the same. yet the different styles are
not so diverse as to leave you feeling
like you just listened to a Battle of
the Bands or a Greatest Songs of the
Century album.

The rhythm section (Wells Kelly
on drums. Lance Hoppcn on bass) is
as tight as any popular band I have
heard. They are comfortable in all of
the various styles of music on the
album.

The solo instruments (JohnHall,
Guitar and Larry Hoppen on piano.
organ. guitar, synthesizer,
clavinette. trumpet. and you-name-
it) are equally as tasteful. Hall clam-
ed his trade in the best schoolroom.
the recording studio. You’ll find Hall
and Kelly on a wide variety of
albums including ones by Bonnie
Raitt and Seals and Crofts. Hall
produced one of Bonnie Raitt‘s
albums and he's also written some
tunes done by Janis Joplin and most
recently. Rufus. The other front-
man. Larry Happen-j is”thc"bastl'

“A Woman Under the Influence."
John Cassavetes‘ new ﬁlm. though
energetic. well-acted. and impressive
in its subject matter. is a disappoin-
ting. unsatisfying and lopsided ex-
cercise in a film style that can be ade-
quately termed “pseudo-
documentary."

What Cassavclcs has attempted
with “A Woman Under the In-
fluence“ is a sensitive portrayal of a
woman. Mabel (Gena Rowlttnds)
who is suffering from an increasingly

. serious mental disorder (apparently

a schizophrenia of sorts) and the dif-
ficulties her well-meaning but
emotional and simple-minded hus-
band Nick (Peter Fulk) has dealing
with her. "Woman" has a few things
going for it. most ofall the incredibly
charged performances of Falk.

Folk-Rock Magic in Ballroom

by Naomi Friedlander

At certain. rare concerts occurs a
striking. almost magical moment
when audience and performers
merge. each entertaining each other.
This occurred Sunday nigltt. when
AItcc Two-Step and Livingston
Taylor. lock-rock and country
musicians. performed in the Campus
Center Ballroom. I‘rom the begin—
ning. the audience and performers
had reached out gropingly. hoping
to grasp and take on each other's
desires and capabilities. And then.
after fumbling. trying. failing. and
trying again. both listeners and
entertainers came together. in-
terweaving the production of the
music and its absorption.

Aztec Two-Step. comprised of
Neal Shulman and Rex liowler.
played first. beginning with one of
their most popular love songs. “Kill-
ing Me." From this. the group mov-
cd to newer material. songs like
“There Will Always Be a Faster
Gun" and “Ilumpty Dumpty and
Cinderella." The audience. though
largely unacquainted with these
songs. rcactcd warmly to Aztcc’l'wo-
Step‘s witty. humorous comments
and the flowing. rich style that
characteri/cs the group. The
musicians. who both play acoustic
guitar. are perfectly in tune voatlly
and created swec.hurmoniousduets.

The Ballroom. packed with a full
house of 750 people. rcspondcd
enthusiastically to Aztec ’I'wo-Stcp‘s
performance. And the group was

equally fcrvid. returning to play
three cncorcs. including "Prisoner"
and “The Persecution and Restora-
tion of Dean Moriarty."

“Loved 'cm. great. you must ex-
press our general thanks to the
ttudicncc. You must write in tbcarti-
cle how fantastic they were." Fowler
said after the concert. Iioth he and
Shulman. happy about the concert.
were optimistic about their future
concerts and album. Discussing
when the album will be released.
Shulman said. “I don‘t even want to
say when. Just that it will beout. We
accentuate the positive because it
will be out." The group. which has
been touring all winter. begin work—
ing in Boston in |97l and released
their album in I972. Since thcn.thcy
have played all over the East Coast
and hope that the second record will
bring about a major. cross-country
tour.

Livingston Taylor was equally
enthusiastic about the concert. “I
like Albany very much. ldon't know
tnuch about Albany but I like the
school very much. A beautiful con-
cert and a beautifulztudicnce—~they
were really great.“ Taylor. accom-

Taylor closed with two cncorcs.

in his vibrant quality his apprecia-
tion of the audience‘s warm. glowing
responses.

overwhelniing—Eiwe get ' the feeling
that Cassavetes had something Very
potent here that went very wrong

K somewhere along the‘line.

It is some time into the ﬁlm that
we begin to realize that Mabel is
more than a slightly eccentric subur-
ban housewife. Mabel has sent her

. three kids away with her mother so

she can have some time alone with
her husband. a construction worker
who is almost always seen in a frater-
nity jacket and beach hat—-
affectations that are not nearly as in-
congruous as the woman he has
married.

Nick. who has promised Mabel
this "date" for weeks. is unable to
make it home because of an
emergency cull—u broken water
main—that needs immediate atten-
tion. Mabel ends hcr chainsmoking
and pacing vigil for Nick and goes to
a local bar where she llllOWs herself
to be picked up. seemingly without
the slightest motivation. Nick.
though he is chauvinistic and un—
aware ol her problems (“She can
cook. sew. washuso what‘s the
problem'l"). does love her in his own
simple way. We begin to wonder
what exactly is the problem with
Mabel. But Cassavclcs' technique
(he wrote the script) of letting the
story unfold itself iii a strictly
chronological fashion. with little
regard for (or misjudgemcnt of)
what is importantund what istrivial.

significance of long and tedious
scenes to be revealed. Cttssttvetcs

scenes wholly unnecessary or in ned
of serious revision.

Mabcl‘s problems are made pain-
fully obvious when hc comes home
the next moming with ten orso ofhis
construction buddies (Mabcl's lovcr
has lied) and she cooks them all u
spaghetti breakfast. In addition to
accepting Nick‘s fellow workers into

decides to have her committed. She
spends six months in an institution
but returns not much forthe better.
Cussavctcs appears to have a
number of directions in which he
wanted the ﬁlm to go. but none of

them are developed to the point,
where we could identify one as the“,
theme with any sort of critical:
assurodncss. As a message aboutthe.
way we treat madness in our society...

the ﬁlm is weak because Nick. whose
relationship with Mabel is Ihe only
developed one. can hardly represent
society within the context ofthe ﬁlm.
Society‘s other elements are evident
in the ﬁlm. yet are never really ex-
plored. The doctor who commits
her. Nick‘s mother. and Mabcl‘s
parents are only alottcd token
positions in the ﬁlm. Asa study of
Nick and Mabel it is weak because
Mnbcl. as half the marriage. is vir-
tually inopcrtttivea she can‘t react to
Nick. And it fails as a study ofNick
because. as the title of the film
suggests. much of the film‘s light is
thrown on Mabel's dilcmma.

What we are left are a number of
sketchy bits and pieces. any one of
wltich. cxpttndcd. would have
resulted in al'powcr‘l'ul exploration of
at not so uncommon problem. Still.
“A Woman Under the Influence"
does have a few things to its advan-
tage. for instancc the depiction of
the phenomenon we all know so
well. “the awkward moment.“ Nick's
continued inability to say or do the
right thing at the right time often
makes one squinn in his seat with

ample of this is when Nick invites a
few doIen people to his house for
Mubel‘s homecoming from the
hospital. but tells thctn it's better if
they go home. As they are leaving.
Mabel is just arriving. But these in-
frequent moments can‘t save the film
from being much more than a well-
inlcntioned litilure—Cassnvctcs has

Barbieri’s Spicy Precise Jazz

by Spence Raggio and Matt Kauf-
man

Modern disciplined jam. spiced
with Latin rhythms this is the
music of Argentine suxaphonist
(into Burbicri. Just recently at The
Bottom Line. liarbieri performed to
a friendly. politely subdued audience
(a pleasant change from the bar-
barous hordes of the Garden and the
Academy) with a confidence and
precision about his music that is
noticeably absent in too many of
today‘s rock musicians.

There was little verbal contact
between llarbieri and his audience.
The band walked onto the stage and.
immediately after the introduction.

energy directly into the music. Sub-

tle and unassuming. the music flows
about you and takesover your senses
almost before you realise it. Barbicri

everything on a smooth level but
with that undercurrent of tension
that makes listening to the band en-
joyablc.

Although each member of the
band was given the opportunity to
solo. it's u case of the whole being
much stronger than the sum of the
parts. The rhythm section remained
a rhythm section. never breaking the
mood or balance of a compostition.
never intruding in upon the front
line.

ccutcd. He managed to achieve a'
piercing tone that interfered with.
rather than complimented. the other
musicians: it was too sharp. it con-
trasted too strongly. Gradually.
though. he began to grow more com-
forlablc on stage. sliding more easily
into the music.

Iiarbicri himself is excellent on the
sax. and has many aesthetically
sound musical ideas. No mass-
appeal artist. Barbieri is well suited
to the tub scene. wherehcapparcntly
already enjoys a large measure of
popularity.

The warm-up group was Billie
I’urdic‘s band. live musicians who
seemed to bcold friends to thccrowd
at The Iiottom Linc. Forced due to
sickness to play without their
guitarist. they carried on quite well.
The high point of their set Iwus‘ a
Stevie Wonder song during which
Ihtrbieri‘s tubu player and AWB's
new drummcrjoined l’urdicon stage
to help out. They were a last minute
replacement for Michal Urbaniak's
l-‘usion. who reportedly was forced
to cut his engagement short due to
drummer problems. but they left
after about an hour to loud warm
applause from the audience.
