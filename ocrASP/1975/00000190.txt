St. Petersburg, Flc.,(AP) If he had
been a more ruthless man, Joe Gar-
agiola might have dug a spike into
one of Jackie Robinson‘s outstrcch-

history.

Instead, he bowed to discretion
and shattered his right shoulder in a

thudding crash that changed the life
of Lloe Garagioia.

"‘That accident 'didn't exactly
knock me out of baseball, but it

"Teams ‘have repeatedly mis-
interpreted our rules which require
that every. participant sign the
medical-team roster form PRIOR to
participating in any A.M.I.A. event.
Failure to do so results in forfeiture
ofthat event by the incligiblc player‘s
team, and possible suspension of the
violator(s)."

“Teams may add pluycrs to their
rosters up till thcir third games." All-
man said, “But no one can play until
they have signed the team-roster.
Another new rule opens rosters to

transfers at mid-year for the first
three weeks of the semester. but no
person who was in school during the
previous semester may sign without
first appealing to the Council. This
rule is designed to prevent so-callcd

“Our medical regulations have not
