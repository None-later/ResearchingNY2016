The Circle Game

The disgusting manner in which three dogs were executed on the podium last week
deserves special note. How about A ﬂat? And that's another thing. The beer is much to
flat in the Rathskeller. And sometimes it‘s green, for some ungodly reason. And what
about god anyway? Has he reallybecn forgotten? An elephant never forgets you know
and so maybe we really should vote Republican more oftenjust so we remember whosd
in office. Just think: A Democratic office where nobody remembers anything. it would
be innovative. since they would constatly have to come up with new ideas. Constant
Comment is something that happens when you drink tea. and it is quite absurd. Tea
and crumpets taste good with constant comment. though it gets boring sometimes like
Central Council meetings, University Senate meetings. FSA Bored of Directors
meetings, and most other meetings. Why are meetings horing’.’ Because.

But we are off on a tangent. which is not the point. Or the square drawn from that
pomt tangent to a circle. The Circle Game is an excellent lyric from a Joni Mitchell
song. Joni lives with David Geffen, who used to go out with Sony and Cher. Cheap TV"
You bet. Those SONY people can really do it. Which brings us to Jerry Rubin who
isnt very interesting now that the sixties are over. so let's keep on going to Reiuben'
sandwhiches, which are excellent at the Patroon Room Restaurant. At least that is
what Central Council Chairperson Lew Firiler says, and we can say with reason and
support that a department chairman in this University ordered one for lunch on
Monday.

What‘do you associate with Monday? Blues? Red is preferable in most cases. Surely
anything is better than concrete white, after a few years here. Then again. when else
would you get to live in such a weird place, that anyone who visits considers weird but
gligesrdents don‘t appear to agree. 0h! Heres one appearing to agree at the Swan
Furthermore, it's very tiring to go on and on readingthrough something that never
seems to get anywhere. Here we are. though. at anywhere. We were actually here all the
time, but you wouldn't have believed us at first. Which brings us to the Wizard 0/07
which was too long ago to remember so we'll keep on going right on to Racing-Ca;
szre, which really has nothing to do at all with Harriet though lwould indeed enjo a
piece of Baby Ruth, an excellent candy. Babe Ruth wasa baseball player but we douybt
that. It has something to do with the adrenalin. or at least sweating throiigh a hundred
exams before finding out we don‘t really want to be a doctor after all. A horrible
experience.

Which is nothing new, if you've read this far.

No more would they roam,
