Ilia ﬁnal Blue!

by Stephen Ladenhelm and Art
Tamarltln .

A hot controversy has been raging
for a number of years iit the State
University of New York at Albany:
over scholastic cotnpitition between
Biology Majors and Accounting
Majors. regarding who \t'ottldfonic
otit on top.‘ The question was finally
resolved by the logical.
intellectually~dcteniiining game ol
chess. .

The game was conveniently
played last week in the University
library. Colors were determined by
who was carrying the most pencils.
The Biology major edged the Ac-
counting major 20 to is. HO\\t.\Ll.
the judges ruled that ill pcrlcctly
sharpened pencils were better talin
20 chewed. blunt ones and awarded
white to the Accounting major.

The game began:

While Elm/t

At this point. the Biology major
t'ttlttlttt‘lllctl that it was about time
that his opponent develop her
Bishops saying: "They are not very
well posted where they are.“ Visiny
pissed. Miss Accounting ventured
with 2.N-Q2and the game continued
2.l'-K4; 3.Pxi’. N-NS: 4.P<KR3.
Suddenly. Mr. Boilogy found it
necessary to excuse himself stating
"You'll haw to pardon me, Miss Ac-
counting niajorcttc. but 1‘“ be back
as soon as humanly possible." Coti-
t'iised. she replied. “Did you make
your movie yet?“ lmpaticntly. he
answered sharply. "Where the hell
do you think I‘m going; to make my
move." ‘

the final move came. unlor-
tunatclv. as a blow to Miss Accoun-
ting. it‘was 4.N-Kb!l and seeing (or
not seeing) 5.i’xN.QpR5ch:b.P«N3.
Qxi’ is mate. she resigned.
