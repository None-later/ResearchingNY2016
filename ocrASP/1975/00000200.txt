(CPS)At campuses across the
country, the organizing skill and fer-
vor once expended in the anti-war,
civil rights and environmental
movements have been aimed at a
new cause: Food Day. April I7.
1975.

“The whole idea of Food Day is to
involve people who are interested in
nutrition, poverty. world food shor-
tages. the weakness of our national
food policies, grain storage and
agribusiness," said Dr. Michael
Jacobson, co-director of the Center
forScicncc in the Public lttterestand
originator of Food Day.

Jacobson said the idea came to
him when a high school girl asked
what she could do about world food
crisis. “Organize a teach-in.".laeob-
son recommended. which started
him think about Earth Day. a otte-
day conseiousness-raising about the
environment in l97l. Why not a
Food Day. he thought.

“There will be lots of high school.
college and even grammar school
kids who will lcam to organize ac-
tivities." lte said, “which is what
Earth Day did for thousands of peo-
ple. and many of those people have
become permanent activists.“

For those who question the need
for a day of concern about food.
Jacobson and his cohorts at CSI’I
unleash a barrage ol' acts about the
American way of eating inluding:

The U.S. military bttdgct is ()0
times greater than the budget for
overseas economic ais. In fact. dur-

B-MWL

APRIL 11, 1975

Student  ‘

ing a l4-hour period, the Defense
Department spends more than the
entire budget of the United Nations
food program. '

The ad budget of GeneralFoods is
almost three times bigger than the
budget of the Food Bureau of the
Food and Drug Administration.

The American meat-based diet
deprives the world of l8 million tons
of cereal protein. an amount almost
equal to the world‘s protein deficien-
cy.
Only about 40% of Americans
eligible for food stamps currently
receive them.

40 million Americans are'
overweight and almost half die of
heart disease. largely because they
consume on the average of mo
pounds of sugar a year.

Wheat-Roots Organizing

Among tltc groups that are
targeting efforts for April 17 is
Oxfam-America. which has ad-
vocated that Americans “plant a
seed for change." then send the the
equiva lent cost of seeds and plants to
Oxt'am to help fanners in developing
countries grow the food they need.

In addition. the newly-formed
Center for Food and Population
Studies of the U .S. NationalStudcnt
Association has written all student
body presidents urging them to start
ltungcr action projects. The Center
has said it also wants to seriIc as a
“conduit between campuses and es-
tablished food and population

 

groups.“'

Meanwhile. the most ambitious

localorgan izing so far has occured‘at
the University of’Michigan, Ann Ar-

y bpr where a sirgyday conference on
.food was held? March was to call 

attention to Food Day. Speakers in-
cluded Ralph Nader. Michael

Jacobson. Harvard nutritionist Jean .

Mayer and Francis Moore Lappe.
author of Diet for a Small Planet.

The conference closed with a
“Vegeta-ball." in which all guests
were asked to dress as any non-meat
food item.

m. Other schools have also jumped
oh the t'oodwagon to plan a myriad
of workshops, film. lectures.
hearings, teach-ins and fasts around
the time of Food Day. These include
Yale. Dartmouth.Cornell. Harvard.
Tufts, Fordham. the University of
Connecticut. the University of
Maryland. the University of Miami
and the University of Chicago.

Rules For Food Radicals

As a start. CSl’l has urged
prospective campus food activists to:

Find out how much fertilizer your
univcrisity'uses to keep its lawns
green and request that such a
wasteful use fo the critically-needed
resource be halted.

Request that at least half the selec-
tions in vending machines on cam-
pus conta in wholesome snack foods-
l'ruit. fruit juice. yogurt and unsalted
nuts and seedsinstcad ofjunk foods.

Junk It Campaign Assails

Terrible Ten Foods

(Cl’S)»ln conjunction with
national Food Day. April l7. the
Center for Science in the Public In-
terest has announced a “Junk It!"
campaign against the “terrible ten“
foods.

“These foods epitomim
everything that is wrong with the
American food supply.“ said the
Center‘s Food Dtty l’rojcct director
Dr. Miclutcl Jacobson. “Many of
thctn are high in sugar or fat and
contribute to our major health
problems: tooth decay. obesity.
bowel cancer and heart disease.

“Most of the foods are made by
giant corporations that have driven
smaller companies ottt of business
and now control the market. Many
of these giant contpanilcs have been
accused by the gotcrnment ol'pricc-
fixing and other monopolistic prac-
tices.“

The Center unveiled the "Terrible
Ten" as:
