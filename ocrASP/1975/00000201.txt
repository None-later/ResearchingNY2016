Ed Commissioner Nyquist
Pushing Integration Plans

by Steven P. Rosenfeld

ALBANY, NY. (AP) State
Education Commissioner Ewald
Nyquist continued to hedge Thurs-
day on whether a fall target date will
be met for imposing state-ordered
integration plans in ﬁve upstate
school districts.

Nyquist said he is sure that plans
to end segregation would be im-
plcmentcd by the start of the new
school year in at least some of the
districts involved- which include
Buffalo. Newburgh. Utica, Mount
Vernon and Lackawanna.

He told a news conference that
because the state Board of Regents
has adopted an integration policy
which dc-cmphttzises the use of bus-
ing to end segregation. his staff has
been meeting with school officials to
discuss “possibilities other titan
sheer busing."

'l'he contmissioncfs staff has
visited or is visiting four of the five
districts. Nyquist said.

The comments come in response
to questions by reporters at ti news
conference called to discuss expan-
ding educational opportunities for
the handicapped.

dcsegrcgate in September.".Nyquist
declared. He said he was still op-
timistic that the state could meet the .
target date for all ﬁve districts, but
added that it was virtually impossi-
ble to bea pessimist and hold the job
of overseeing all public and private
schools in the state.

The highly controversial disputes
over integration. which go back to
years. havebecn stalled in the courts.
the legislature and most recently by
shifts in policy by the Board of
Regents- which sets policy for Ny-
quist to carry out.

Since last October. the Regents
have changed the policy on integra-
tion. dc-emphasizing the use ot'bus-
ing in liivorofother tools for ending
segregation.

“it remains to be seen what par-
ticular means of integrating schools
suits in prticular community.“ Ny-
.lllist said. He told reporters he is
"confident" that some busing will be
necessary in districtswhich have
"severe concentrations“ of blacks
and whites in different areas.

Lust January. about It) weeks
after the first policy change on in-
tegration. Nyquist issued orders for
the live districts to show cause why
the stale-ordered integration plans

The commissioner said he will no
longer issue show cause orders to all
five districts at the same time. but
will procedd on a district-by-district
basis as soon as possible.

The show cause orders did not
direct specific busing in any district.
but said busing “may well be
desirable."

Singled out for the most extensive
crijigism in the January show cause
orders were‘Buffalo and Newburgh.

As an example of current con-
ditions. of the 28 elementary schools
for kindergarten through eighth
grade in Buffalo. 20 are
predominantly white. the Education
Department said.

The Education Department said
the district established attendance
zones for newly constructed schools
“which have resulted in those
schools being substantially
segregated. although attendance
lones could have been established in
such a way that the student bodies
would have been integrated.“

Nyquist has charged the Buffalo
Board of Education with purposely
fostering segregation to deny equali-
l)’ "l educational opportunity to
many children on the basis of race.

The Newburgh schools were first
directed to integrate by September
of was.

Nyquist‘s order to school officials
in Newburgh noted steps have been
taken to reduce racial isolation. but
that currently, minority enrollment
varies from 3 per cent in oncelemen-
tary school to nearly [00 per cent in
another.

“WAtanner/chiefirivestigatorfoﬂhe ,

state Correctionﬁcornmission uid.
Thursday that a Commission iri-
quiry into conditions at the troubled
Dutchess County Jail wasdropped a
year ago after the intervention of the
county sheriff.

R. Robert Byers. who was ﬁred
last month as head of the com-
mission's special investigations unit.
said the probe “was discontinued in
the living room of Sheriff Lawrence
Quinlan‘s home on April 17.1974.”

Since his dismissal. .Byers has
publicly criticized many of the Com-
mission‘s activities. accusing his
superiors of blocking efforts to con-
duct full investigations of poor jail
conditions throughout the state. The
commission is responsible for in-
specting both the state and localjail
systems.

He told a reporter Thursday that
he is “cooperating fully" with state
Sen. Ralph Marino. R-Nassau.
chairman of the Senate Crime and
Corrections Committee. which will
conduct hearings laterthis month on
the operations and structure of the
Correction Commission.

The Dutehess County Jail. in
l’oughkeepsie. was the site last
month of two suicides. two other
suicide attempts and a brief but
destructive intnate melee.

During the March violence. com-
mission Administrator Morton Van
l-loescn described conditions at the
jail us "intolerable." Thc Commis-
sion has ordered the eotlnty to
appear at a hearing next month to
show cause why the facility should
not be closed.

ministration.

Byers also criticized the Com-
mission's operations generally; say-
ing that he was “concerned” about
conditions at other local jails in the
state as well.

They also said commission per-
sonnel were assigned to spy on Bur-
ton Schoenbach, a former commis-
sion member and frequent critic of
the agency. And they said the vice
