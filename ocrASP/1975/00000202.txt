Vietnam, an issue most people had removed from their consciousness and hoped
never would return, filled the recent break with its reminder of what insantty in
government can’do. The Vietnam War, technically a “police action.“ may soon come to
an end and there are very few who regret it.

A unified communist Vietnam is no disaster for America, and Would mean a more
peaceful world. Totalitarian regimes like Hanio’s are by no means desireable, but they
are no less so than Thieu's South Vietnamese government. Our defense of his control in
hope [of someday there being a democratic government was a waste of resources. As
e‘verttsare showing. South Vietnam does not have the confidence of its people, its army,
or its governmental personnel. Hanoi may not have more of their confidence. but the
political structure that the Viet Cong built up in areas under their control have been far
more‘ personal. responsive and effective than the corrupt and inefﬁcient South
Vietnamese bureaucracy. Both Saigon and Hanoiare interested in power, but Saigon
has shown it is also very interested in making its officials very rich while not being
overly concerned with the welfare of most of the people. With the immense aid the
United States has given South Vietnam over the years it is inconceivable that the
Vietnamese people living in the South could have been unable to organize themselves
fairly and to respect their government unless they truly did not care about what
government there was. Aster years of non-stop war. it is quite understandable that the
primary goal of the Vietnamese, Americans, and the World is to stop the sufferingand
killing that has been so overwhelming as to make issues of freedom and polrtrcs
thouroughly irrelevant.

Students on this campus and throughout the nation devoted time and energy to end
the senseless American war in Vietnam. Years later. the final results of the efforts are
with us.

A New President

..._., a

SUNYA is in an uncertain mood: the school is at crossroads in its history. There is a
great deal of self-reflection in progress. PhD programs are being evaluated. the
legislature has slashed the budget. the dangers of the “greatness syndrome“ are
threatening. and the downturn in the economy has put a blanket ofdepression over the
entire American education system. In the wake of these serious issues. We are going to
have a new President.

Dr. Emmett B. Fields, a high-level administrator from the University of Houston.
will undoubably take over President Louis T. Benezet‘s position inJuly. in many ways
the changeover in the school‘s administration can be called a breath of fresh air. Fields
is different from Benezet. judging from his contact with the university community
when he was here recently, and may providejust the ﬁrmness of direction the school
need s. Fields sacrifices little of Benezet’s openness fora willingness to propose. direct.
and push the UniVersity in a positive direction. Obviously there will always be
disagreements with his decisions and policy. but Fields has the ability to obtairt frorn
the university community confidence in his judgement and enthusiasm for
development of SUNYA.

Fields is familiar with all the sides to the issues in America higher education today
yet understands even more the dangers of fence sitting and procrastination. More than
anything else SUNYA needs confidence in itself. Fields can help the school gain that
confidence.

The Press: A Vulnerable Target

by Ron llendren

’aul Leand ri is dead. Jaap van Wcsel never
made it into Saudi Arabia. Ahmed Baha
liddin got demoted. And Max .lnkobson has
angered a strperpoucr.

lhcsc men are not famous. citltcr in
America or ottt. llttt tltcy are part of a
powctlul force on the world sccnc.

l.cttndri has a l‘renclt journalist. killed
mysteriously alter being questioned recently
by the Sotttlt Vietnamese police. Van Wcscl is
a Dutch ioumulist denied entrance into Saudi
Arabia hccnusc hc is.lc\\‘ish. liddin was editor
of xi] .-lltt'um. perhaps the most important
daily newspaper to Cairo. Jakobsott lives irt
l‘inland where he runs a news service.

What happened to these men is pa t l.ng
pattern that is slowly emerging outﬁt. lie

unease and lack of lirrn leadership.

It is not unusual during such periods that

nations turn to violence. Arrtericatt

and the list of examples seems almost
interminable: the Soviet invasion of

I Leaders who use lorcc nlrnost always fear
journalists. ‘l'ltat is understandable. A free
press. working like it should. exposes
corruption and hypocrisy. arms a popttltrce
wrth facts. and raises hard questions. Like
most cliches. the one about the pert arid the

And if you examinealrnostutry trouble spot

On a cliff-ledge
of a hollow cavern

on the steep side of a cmg
i met her.

She told me she was

a priestess. .

I identiﬁed myself.

She then addressed me
Comrade. sister

and bid me welcome

to the dark side of life.

We entered the cavern

“Sister. you have now entered

you may not leave through

tltc same portal

from whence you came.“

"You didn't tell me that!" l shricked.
My whole being know only fear

I spun around.

the opening to the cavern

was as coal black

as the tunnel ahead.

She was the only thing I could see

I didn‘t understand

there was no light

yet she was constantly illuminated.
llcr skin tight. black. sequined gown
glittcrcd. at times even blinding tne.

“Come sister, she said. we must get

on with o'urjourney."

She didn‘t here me say

“No. nojoumey please."

She took my hand

and with a deﬁnite tug

led me on.

Asweuwent further

I. as I knew myself.

disappwred. I knew only trepidation.

I ﬁnally found words to utter.

“I can go no further."

She stopped abruptly

and with a cold

deadly

eye to eye stare

asked me. ifl wanted to

return to the crag.

and climb;

slowly. treacherously.

the sharp rock tearing my llesh again.

I could feel no more dolor.
Suddenly. I felt nothing.

' it no longer mattered.

I raced ahutd of her.

She caught me. grabbed my hand.
embraced me.

“You are tmly here!“. she exclaimed.
“Comrade! Sister!

Welcome. Welcome

to the dark side of life." .

We beeameJ ‘ends.
sharing experrfenccs on our journey.
lt felt‘so gopd to have a friend again.
Climbingjhe crag. l was alone.
and though the cavern was black.

I had a comrade. a sister.

“Now that you are truly here.

I must initiate you.

I am the priestess Vitas.

of these caverns.

You will leam

my ceretnonies.

the complex rituals.

the rites of passage."

I loved it.

Never had I known such acceptance.
With my sister.

I cloyingly continued.

our journey

through the buvcrn. down

the dark side of life.

One day. I could see light.

far. very far in the distance.

We ran quickly on. hand in hand.
Just before the mouth of the cavern.
she bolted suddenly still.

. becoming still

I was" thrown asunder. 0 i
stumbling forward. 

just outside the cavern.

Hands outstretched. l exclaimed.
“Sister come!“

Then I quickly retracted.

my palms now closed

’ I‘m in light.

Do I want hcr'.’ Need her‘.’

llut before I could decide

She started laughing. hideously.
“A re you so naive as to thing.
that you are my only sister?“

I stood silent.

“Many find me eatoptric.

‘I'hesc cavents arc catacombcd.

to the dark side of life.
You‘re free. in light.

We‘ve no need for one-another anymore.

or at least

for now." 5".“
