0X Roche; Strawbgsmﬁes _, .~ ,_ 

by Spence Ragglo
and Matt Kaufman

Theater owners are quickly dis-
covering that they can no longerpre-
sent movies and plays at current
prices and still expect long runs and
packed houses. For many it has
become an even more desperate
situation~simply expecting to re-
main in business leaves them on un-
certain ground. It is basically forthis
reason that more and more theaters
are turning to rock.

The music business is booming;
record salcsare up. and even though
ticket sales are not as high as they
once were. a rock concert will still
pull in more peoplc-——and ata higher
price per ticket than a movie or play.

So we have Harry Chapin at the
Ethel Barrymore. Liza Minclli and
Belle Midlcr at the Winter Garden,
Moll and Queen playing the Uris.
Bowie and Sly at Radio City and of
course the Academy of Music. Now,
taking a cue from Howard Stein's
successful Academy of Music, the
Beacon theater on Broadway and
74th and the Calderone in
llempstcad. L.I.. have both un-
dcrgone structural and acoustical
renovations. becoming full time con-
cert halls.

One of the first shows booked at
the Calderone was John Entwistle's
Ox. Bassist for the Who, Entwistle
has been the most consistent solo
performer in the group, releasing
three albums with his old group
Rigor Mortis and a fourth. Mad
Dog. with his new group, Ox. At a
Who concert Entwistle is thcgroup‘s

anchor. motionless except for his
ﬁngers which fly across the strings
with casual accuracy. He is the mme
with 0x. though he now has avisual-
ly more subdued group to work with.
Drummer Graham Deakin and
Tony Ashton on keyboard comprise
the bands rhythm section. leaving
lintwistIe—who also does vocals—
and guitarist Deacon out front.0x is
all young musicians. a far cry from
the professionals Entwistle is ac-
customed to Working with. yet they
do a fine job. Deacon was excellent.
even on songs like “Boris The
Spider“ and “My Wife“ where there
is an almost automatic tendency to
compare him with Townshend.

0x is straight rock ‘n‘ roll. no gim-
micks. no flash, but laced with the
morbid sense of humor of John
lintwistle. They chose their set
carefully. concentrating mainly on
Smut/r l’uur I'leurlAgeinsI The Wall
and Mad Dog. delivering a fast mov-
ing. \chI-paccdw though short-
performance.

The Calderonc fonnerly offered
films and still looks like a movie
house. The floor seats cover a deep
narrow area rather than a shallow
wide one. and the balcony is set too
deeply into the back of the theater.
But it is still a one ofa kind place on
Long Island and as such is long over-
due.

The Beacon, however, falls into
the Academy mold. It's a large old
theater, over decorated architecture
and all. The acousticsarebetterthan
those in the Academy and this.along
with its Broadway location. may

help Ron Delsener to become the -

Howard Stein of uptown New York.
Strawbs. recently played the

I Beacon. along with the premiere US

performance of the Pretty Things.
The Pretty Things have been receiv-
ing a lot of recognition lately. since
being signed. along with Bad Com-
pany. on Led Zeppelin‘s new Swan
Song label. They‘ve been a major
rock band in England since the early
sixties; their albums have been
critical successes but were never
readily available in the states until
their latest. Silk Torpedo.

In spite of their big build up. the
Pretty Things were a disappoint-
ment. Their stage presence is ob-
noxious; they came on like raucous
rockers and it didn‘t go over at all
with the Strawbs crowd. Musically
they were mediocre at best. insisting
on long extended jams that did
nothing but drag. and even digging
out the old audience participation
routine. “Freakin' at the Beacon!"'.".’

Strawbs were amazing. An ex-
cellent sound system, beautiful
lighting. great music—what else is
there? The present version of
Strawbs consists ofDavc Cousins on
acoustic guitar and vocals. Dave
Lambert on electric guitar and
vocals, Cahs Cronk on bass. John
Howkcn on keyboards and Rod
Coombcs on drums. Cousins has the
reputation of running Strawbs with
an unmerciful hand. tossing per-
sonnel in and out of the group at a
moments notice. The current
members have been together over

recent New Vortt concert.

Hudson and Ford decided to go
solo—major losses, true. but
Strawbs reemcrged better than ever
with New and Heroine. their most
consistently pleasing release.
Thegroup now focuses. more than
ever before. on the vocals and song
writing talents of Cousins. Lambert
does do some vocals and shares the
front spotlight with Cousins, but
there is no question as to whose
group it is. They steered clearoftheir
earlier albums and presented tight
versions of most of their best songs.

of the staff of WRGB covered the

give up his or her career. Second.
Fanny constantly mulls over her
feelings for Nick and. when he re-
cntcrs the picture. she is torn
between that love and her feelings
for Billy. When she finally realizes
how phony Nick is. it is too late—-
Billy has fallen in love with his starin
the Aquacade. So she ends up with
no one.

I was disappointed on several
counts by this film. The story line isa
complete Hollywoodization of the
original story. This is especially evi-
dent during the segment where Nick
asks Fanny to come back to him. In
the movie. Fanny is still married to
Billy. but Nick appears several times
and then asks Fanny to reconsider
him. She walks out on him and flies
to see BilIy.She finds him in thearms
of another woman and a divorce
soon follows. But in Norman
Katm‘s biography. The Fabulous

many even more striking than the
original studio cuts.

After Strawbs most recent refor-
mation. they travelled the road of the
unknown group. hitting all the small
clubs and backing up larger bands.
Now. with more Academy-Beacon-
Calderone type places springing up.
there is an alternative for those
bands not large enough for an arena
and not intimate enough for a club.
And something for all those who
think that they are big enough foran
arena. 

Lady’

Funny. the Brice-Rose divorce takes
place in I938 and Nick's proposition
occurs in l950. l2 years later.
Moreover. Nick appears only once
after his divorce from Fanny. Nick
had little to do with Fanny‘sdivorcc
from Billy. Anotherdiscrcpancy was
the ending. In the movie. Billy
returns to ask Fanny to work once
more with him. to stage a come-
back. This. according to Katov's
book. never occurs. Funny Lady is
more of a vehicle for the talents of
Barbara Streisand than a life story of
one of the funniestand most talented
women of this century. But the real
story would probably be quite bor-
ing and this film is one of the most

entertaining films I‘ve ever seen.
The second disappointment were
the songs. There were few songs in
the film that were sung by the
original l-‘anny. in contrast to mev
