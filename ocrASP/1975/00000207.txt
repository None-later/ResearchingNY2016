couldn‘t help the chills that went up and down
my spine when Streisand sang this number.
The songs that really thrilled me were “How
Lucky Can You Get."and the ultra—funny skit
“Blind Date."

The last disappointment was the use of Ben
Vercen. This marvelous singer and dancer is
giver only one big number and is never seen
again. What a waste of talent.

The good points of the picture make up for
its bad points. The big good point is, of course.
Barbara Streisand. Streisand isat her best and
brightest in a musical. and here she is. Her por-
trayal of this talented woman is quite real
(perhaps because her life is somewhat of a
parallel to that of Fanny). Her voice is. as,
always, chilling in its versatility. She can go

“Let's Hear It For Me.“ Her comic timing is
perfect. ‘

James Caan gave a very good performance
of Billy Rose. He is put at a disadvantage
because I) Streisand tends to overshadow her
co-stars. and 2) Caan looks nothing like Billy
Rose (5 foot. 3 inches. and dumpy). It is in-
teresting to note that Dustin Hoffman and Al
Pacino Were beingconsidcrcd for the part. and
James Cairn got it. But Caan did an admirable
job in his own right. His poignant marriage
proposal to Funny was utterly charming. As a
singer. he has a surprisingly decent voice.

Filming this whole production was James
Wong Howe. who did an excellent job. The
cinematography was carefully and critically
done. with some great special camera work.

The costumes. by Ray Aghnyan and Bob
Muckic. were mind-boggling. Each scene had
a different costume. Especially cffcctivc was
the “Great Day" costume. all black chiffon.
big butterfly sleeves. and buglc beads. These
dcsigncrs'ttscd their talents to the utmost and
came up with some really exciting creations.

This film is u must-sec for those who love
