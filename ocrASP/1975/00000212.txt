"If we lose one more conference
game, we‘ll beout of the race. and we
really have to win all five
[SUNYAC] games this spring to
stand a chance.“

And IltuI. is the lowdown of the
Great Dane varsity baseball hopes
for spring ‘75. straight from the
coach, Bob Burlingame.

Burlingamc‘s crew has just return-
ed from a southem trip in whielt they
played five games with some im-
pressive ballcltths. including two ex-
hibition games. They lost them all.

However. Iiurlingame is not let-
ting it worry him. "The teams were

' way ahead of us." he explained.

“They all had played about ten or
more games already.“ One squad
that defeated the Danes twice. High
Point College. has produced
“something like l9 players that have
signed pro contracts in the last nine
years." according to the coach.

The pitching did not fare very
well. but Burliagame was “fairly
pleased with thchitting.“ In the three
non-exhibititm contests the Danes
lost. they scored 4. 7. and 7 runs.
respectively.

Most of the power was generated
frotn the number 3. 4. and 5 men in
the batting order; 'l'om Blair, senior
captain Vic Giulianclli. and .lay
Milausktts. Blair went 5 for It).
(iiuliunelli went a for It) with two
homers. and Milttuskus garnered (i
hits in l21rips.a|so with two homers.

lhose three “really ripped the
hall“and should hethe“higthrep" in
the hiltng department when the
season starts for real.

“I was fairly pleased with what I

 

 

sent [down South] but we've still got
to shore up our pitching and
defense." said the coach. .

Speaking of pitching. that chore
will be handled primarily by Blair
(who can play second. third. or short '
when not pitching) and sophomore
John Dollard. Together. the
righthanded tandem combined for
all of the Danes‘ wins in the 6-l0 fall
campaign and a I_.75 ERA in con-
ference play.

Ilut after that duo. the rest of the
staff suffers from an acute disease
called incxpcriencitis. Sophomore
Glenn Sowalskie is a possible starter
and although the relief corps is well
stocked with Jim Willoughby (who
also 'plays third). senior Rick
Oltoniewski. and junior Bob
Kronenbcrger. none has seen much
varsity action.

()konieWski has been praised by
Burlingume as “the hardest thrower
on the staff.“ and Kroncnherger
"looked the best“ of the relievers on
the recent swing and may be the
number one fireman. So it‘s not all
that bad.

As far as a lineup is concerned.
llurlingante will probably start
(iuilianelli at catcher. Jeff Breglio at
first. Mark Fuchs at second. Juy
Miluuska; at short. when Blair is
pitching. and Willoughby at third.

the outfield will probably see Mike
(iamage in left. leadoffbatterCurios
()liveras in center. and Paul Nelsen in
right. Al l‘argionc is fighting foran
outfield berth and .lohn trace and
Mark Constantine will he iaiield
reserves. ii a I

But as with all the positions. who
starts "depends on who produces."

ours
humiliate.

is still “wide open.“

The season is scheduled to open
today with the Danes taking on con-
ference Ieader Fredonia at home.
Fredonia as l5 points underthe
new SUNYAC rules.which give two
points for a win and minus one point
for a loss. Albany is tied with Cor-
tland for second in the standings. as
each has nine points; Albany on the
basis of a 6-3 fall conference mark
and Cortland on the basis of a S-I
slate.

"We‘re pointing for them
[Fredonia]." said Burlingame.
Tomorrow. the Danes will be tested
even fu rther as they play a
doubleheader with Cortland.

The Danes will face their Captial
District foes—R.P.i.. Siena. and
Union —twice each and all three are
going to be tough. .

Tough Schedule

Besides the SU NYAC and Capital
District contests. the Danes will be
pitted against Hurtwick. Colgate.
and New Haven in the remaindcroi'
their schedule. Colgate is an NCAA
Division I school and New Haven
finished third in the nation in the re-
cent NCAA baseball finals. “Our
work is really cutout for us. playing
those teams. We‘ll have no
breathers." ‘says the coach.

All in all.‘it‘s going to be rough for
the battnen. Don‘t expect any pen-

nanislil'lying over the baseball field
this year. With the loss of seven
starters from last year‘s squad.
Iiurlingamc conceded. "This is kind
gal; a rebuilding yetir' for us.“ I sup-
pose ilieorily'questit'in is: How good
it tltttson is he'.’
