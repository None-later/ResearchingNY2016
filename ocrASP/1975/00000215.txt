which they learn how to meditate.

student one that may bespclt E yegrre

and Eedla. These mantras were told
to the ASP by former meditators.

Transcendental Meditation is, ac.
cordingto the International Medita-
tion Society, an effective and prac-
tical technique forselfdeveloprnem.
It is being spread throuyiout the
Western world by the Marharishi
Mahesh Yogi.1he numberof people
knowing how to meditate continues
to increase. but the dropout rate
afterwards is not known.

The secret learning ceremony is
the fourth step after two introduc-
tory lecturesand a quick personal im
tcn‘lew where the student must sign
the promise not to reveal the details
of the ceremony. At that time the
course fee is pail. SI25 for adults.
$65 for college students. still less for
younger peopb. The ceremony is
over within fifteen minutes.Thestu-

Then he dips the flowers in some li-
quid and shakes it on the rice. Next
the teacher kneels. indiralingto the
student that he should also. Ap-
parently this is when the mantra
comes to the teacher, a skill learned
under the Marharishi. and soon the
teacher begins to chant it. The stu«
dent is asked to join in and the
teacher then slowly lowers the
volume of the chant. with the stu-
dent. until neither are saying
anything. The teacher tells the stu-
dent to close his eyes and continue
chantingit "in hishd." The student
is meditating. and after a while is
told to open his eyes. The teacher
will ask some questions about it. like
“was it paceful’f‘ which are close to

There are group meetings for the
next few days where problems are
aired and discussed and method is
explained furtherand in moredetail.
For example, the release of stress as
bubbles coming to the surface oflhe
mind and popping.

A meditation group has received
recognition from Student Associa-
tion. and indeed there are many
practitioners at SUNYA. SIMS-
IMS claims that anyone can learn
and successfully practice TM. but
many meditators disagree. Some
people h'ave likened TM to the soma
drug that kept the people satisfied in
spite of their oppression in Hartley's
Brave New World. Others. including
businessmen, politicians and
housewives, say that TM has im-

proved their lives a great dwl, in— _

creasing their efficiency. raising
grades. endingabusivedrug use. and
generally increasing life satisfaction.

I ﬁnd it virtually impossible to
separate philosophy from teaching
techniques. personality
characteristics. and the particular
disctpline that is involved. A
teacher‘s main responsibility is to
impart knowledge and to stimulate
intellectual growth.

The most important ingredient is
to create a classroom atmosphere
that gives the student the desire [0

formal atmosphcre. yet controlled.

The teacher should convey to the
student that he wants questions. The

As an undergraduate instructor

within. the School of Business. my
major teaching techniques are to
crte an atmosphere ofinteraction
in the chssmom. to give my students
an extensive set of lecture notes. and
to spend as much time as possible
with students in scheduled review
sessions and during ofﬁce hours.
There isnothing unusualabout these
methods. I feel the main reason I
have been sucessful is because ofthc
added contact time I have with my
students.
