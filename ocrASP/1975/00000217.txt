Students have long clamored for input in the tenure process, and here they have been -

more successful than in most universities. But student votes on tenure committees
were negotiated out of existence last fall when the contract with the American
Association of Professors (AAP) included a clause banning student votes. The union
demand (and the State‘s agreement to it) bypassed not only Student Association but
also SUNYA‘s governance system, the University Senate. The union also bypassed the
Senate‘s position on parking privileges after that body had discussed, analyzed and
debated for months to come to that decision.

Tenure review. however. suffers without sufficient student input. An appointment or
tenure renewal based soley on research, publication. and faculty relationships will fail
to properlyjudge candidates. Research and publication are important, especially at a
university, and a professor in an unneeded specialty or who is so different from others
in the department as to cause serious problems with the program would primarily be
judged in these areas by other faculty. But teaching is also an important part of the
university‘s purpose. and no faculty member can evaluate a teacher‘s performance like
students can.

Some claim that students who receive good grades will like a professor, and students
who receive poor grades will not. To the extent that one believes that students are not
able to view teachingobjectively. this claim has some merit. But is it any different to say
that a professor who plays tennis with the candidate will like him and that one who
resented his good looks won't? To say that faculty are significantly more tnatiire in
their judgement than students is. alas, a difficult position to support.

Though a few departments at SUNYA are still not convinced. student evaluations
present faculty with invaluable assistance in making tenure and renctval decisions. The
Student Association‘s Ai‘s‘cstslnem of Courses and Teachers (ACT). and the
departmental evaluations have the ability to channel the full import of student
evaluations to the decision making levels of appointment anCWiliSttlnd‘lCllUl'C. lfACT
can develop to a point where it can satisfy all departments tvith objective and or
subjective (written) cvaluatiorts it can be an invaluable tool to students and to other
faculty and administrators as well. It is already serving all parts of the university
community with valuable information.

Students should sit on tenre committees too because there is such a difference in
perspective between faculty and students that detailed opinions from the other side of
the classroom are essential tojudgc how well the professor teaches and how much his
published material and research is reﬂected inzwhatthestudents are gaining from that
professor. There are many students qualified to discussindetaila professors‘ teaching
ability and their presence on the committee permits other faculty to investigate other
qualites (like advisement capabilities or openness) more thoroughly.

Dr. Emmett Fields. SUNYA‘s next President. said he wasin favor of student input
and against students voting on tenure cases. but he felt overall that it was a peer
evaluation. Tenure is a peer evaluation but to be a fair evaluation, it needs extensive
student input and to insure that fairness. students shouldbe able to vote on tenure
committees.

Smiling In the Sun

All weekend it locker/warm. but winds leftover from March pushed the wind-chilled

temperature to a wintery level. Then. yesterday. the ideal became the real and students

took part in the yearly ritual of spring. Now. in spite of upcoming finals and the
uncertainties of summer. we can warm ourselves and smile in the sun.

Focus

The End of the American Century

One thing which differentiates man fromall
otherrinimalsishisribility to question both the
meaning of his existence anti the purpose
behind his actions. When faced with a tragic
turn of events which negate all our previous
efforts we seem to ask one fundamental
ititesti it: "What was it all for?" More
specifically iii the spring of I975: “What was
our commitment in Vietnam all for?“

With iltc virtual collapse of a viirble. tron-
comrnunisl South Vietnam it seems as if most
Americans genuinely feel that otir
involvement over there was for naught. Fifty-
six thousand American lives. SIStl billioit in
American money. ten years ofnirtronal debate
arid energy all irtvairt. \Vlto. back iit 1965 or
[970. would believe that the only saving gritcc
alter sending one million men to Southeast
Asia would he an airlift of Vietnamese
orphans?

liut all those mistakes arid misdeeds which
have come to be known as “Vietnam” are past
history. After the long nigltl of Watergate the
one thing this country docs not need now is
another period of division. polarization. and
recriniinatinn over a sensitive political issue.
The task of this country now is to heal its
wounds and look toward the future. No
amourtt of effort will ever change the events of
the past,

One thing should he remembered: fifty-six
thousand melt made the greatest sacrifice itity
one country could ever ask of it person~tlte
giving oflife on the battlefield. 'l'ltat shame we
feel from the mt‘ttniitgicssttcs‘s of Vietnam
comes not from our soldiers who fought but
rather from tho5c men who chartered our
course there: Robert McNamara. Wiilt
ltostow. McGeorge lluritly. Maxwell Taylor
and others. No sliiune should he felt by any
individual who served his country with butter.

Above all else. to paraphrase President,
