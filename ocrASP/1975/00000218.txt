 

While Brian’ 5 away, vacationing in Europe, pinching asses along
the Champs Elysees, we're here working on ASPECTS for him.

There's no single theme to this issue but we feel that these stories
are appropriate at this time. The article on the I.F.K. assassination is Photo Credits
the result of a great deal of research on the part of the author. The
project was slated to be published in theWashingtonParkSpirit,
but this unfortunately, is no longer with us. We are proud to be able
to present it to you in its entirety. We'll be with you for the remainder
of the semester, having left the Arts Section in extremely capable

hands.

The Children Always§glffest9i§9f  w   w- The Children AIWays Suffer Most

As a child, your most traumatic experience may have been the first three days
of Kindergarenpr the timeyou had the Chicken pox in July. ln Vietnam, children
just old enough for school have known death and destruction their whole lives, as
have their parents. An entire generation has never known peace, and

   a o experienced only war and suffering.
Will this go on for many more years, orwill it come to an end in the near future?
if it does end will it bring an end to the suffering of the people?
