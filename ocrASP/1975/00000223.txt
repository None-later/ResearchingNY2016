. Bob Carson had never felt as out
' of place asjhedid that moment,
gazing through'the‘window of his
coed-dorm room. ‘The new multi-
million dollar college complex of
which he-was ,now a part seemed

huge and remote. True. he'had lived .

in Brooklyn. apart of the largest city
in the UnitedVStates.and wasused to
big places. But it wasn‘t really the
bigness that got to him. Just what
was it? _
' A barely audible "tap-tap" at the
' door made Bob jump. Boy, he was
upset. It was probably Tom. from
down the hall. He said he might stop
by befor'e going to dinner. As he
opened the door his mouth nearly
fell to the floor. There. standing in
front of him. was a« girl. Half
expecting her to say something like,
“Oh. excuse me. Wrong room.“. he
was again stunned as she smiled and
' in a tone as soft and airy as her tap-
tap said. “Hi!”

In spite of his agitated state. Bob
managed to "blurt' out a hello and
smile back. What was going on. he
wondered. Did he know her? Why
was she here?

“I was wondering if my roommate
and I could keep some things in your
refrigerator. that is if you have room.
They ran out of them before we
could get one. and: now we have

3' 1.x

 

some food thdt will spoil if we don‘t

get it cold. I saw you carry yours in
this morning. and thought maybe
you‘dlet us.“ '

Bob suddenly understood.
Somebody wanted something from
him again. it seemed the only time
people ever paid attention to him
was when they wanted something.
He had had enough of thatat home.
Why couldn't things be different
here? He felt the urge to tell this
intruder off and slam the door shut.
but his training prevailed ashe heard
himself say. “Why not? We‘ve got
plenty of room."

She smiled again and he wondered
how he could have ever wanted to
yell at her. She turned and
disappeared down the hall. callingas
she went. "I‘ll be back with it right
away." V

Before he knew it. they were
sitting side-by-side having milk and
cake and had been talking for hours.
Dinner was long since over. but Bob
hadn't noticed until he glanced at the
clock on his desk. She seemed to
notice the time simultaneously. for a
few seconds laterthe room was again
empty. 'save for the onc.lonely boy
and a whispered promise to return.

“Maybe she was different.“ he
mused. Afterall. he hadn't met that
many people since arriving two
weeks ago. Maybe he waswrongand

things weredifferenthere. He’d lit in
after all. '

That next Thursday they went to a
sorority party together. Bob was
amazed at how many friends she
had. and could scarcely keep up with
all the names. At first he was thrilled
at'each new introduction. But later
into the night he felt out of place, not
knowing where to turn or what to
say. More than a few times she had
to bail Bob out. and on leaving he
was very depressed. Bob shrugged it
off. though. and after he said good
night he Was back in a good mood.
Or so he thought.

That night he lay in bed. awake
and restless. Why was he so
comfortable when he was with her
alone. yet ina crowd orby himselfhe
was panicky and nerve-wracked? He
finally fell off to sleep.

They began to date every
weekend. He thought of her
constantly. She was his refuge.
something to relate to. She made his
world liveable. He thought she felt
the same. One day in the beginning
ofthc second semester. he found out
differently.

He was retuming to hisdorm.The
warm and beautiful day added a
special sparkle to his mood. Last
night. he had decided to ask hertogo
steady. It would be almost a
formality. he thought to himself.

Just to make it official. He was even
skipping his class so he could
surprise her.

He scurried up the steps and
entering his room fumbled at the
wrappings. The ring shone and
transfonned the golden—yellow beam
of sunlight into an airy and soft-
white glow. It reminded him of her
smile.

He had never surprised Diane like
this before. They had always agreed
beforehand when they Would see
each other. This would be just the
right time to break the pattern. He
knew she‘d be in wshehad a paper to
write.

As he walked softly up to thedoor.
he hea rd laughing. Probably Diane‘s
roommate was back from class early.
But the one voice did sound too
deep. He knocked and the voices
stopped. He knocked again harder.
but no anSWer. As he was turning to
go away. the door clicked and Diane
stuck her head out. She gulped. and
broke a smile. The smile was not the
soft one that liob had come loadore.
He spoke first. “Uh. l'li.“. not really
knowing what to say. She explained
that she had been showering. and
was sorry she hadn't been able to
answer the door right away. Bob
nodded and when she didn't ask him
in. said he‘d see her later. As he
walked back to the room. he tried to
piece together what had happened.
That night he did not see her in
fact. he avoided the dorm
completely.

The next afternoon she came

lips acted sad. "is something
wrong?“

“You know what‘s wrong. Why
did you take so long to answer
yesterday? Why didn‘t you let me
in?"

Her face fell when she realized she
had been caught. She could use him
no longer. “it took you longcnough.
if you don‘t like it. go to..." She
stunned out as she finished her
sentence.

Alone in his room. Hob felt that
empty feeling return. He finally
knew what caused it. People were all
the same. 'lhey always look and
never gave. blow he understood that
he felt out of place because he um
different. But that wasn‘t the
problem. You got used to being
different. lint when you couldn‘t
recognize the different people as
such. when your best friends turned
out to be the most hostile. you lost
faith in yourself. That feeling of not
knowing up from down got to you.

knowing if you belonged anywhere.
The telephone rang.

“l'lello. Bob. This is Susan. from
math class. Could you help me with
my homework? I‘m completely lost.“

Fora moment lioh thought back
to Diane and that first meeting long
ago. Another person wanted
something.

"Sure. ls seven-thirty 0.K.'!“

“'l'hul's line. I‘ll come over to your
room then.“ Before site hung up she
added. “And thanks. Bob.“

“Anytime.” he replied.

Maybe it was worth it after all.
