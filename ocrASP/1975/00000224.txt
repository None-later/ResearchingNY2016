"On the other hand-you can't

Nelson said in a production he

Vie Giulienelli's two-out, two-
strike base hit to rightﬁeld in the
bottom of the sixth inning. drove
home the runs that gave the Albany
Great Danes a crucial 2-I victory
over Cortland in the second game of
their home doubleheader Saturday.
keeping alive their slim hopes for the
SUNYAC title.

After dropping the ﬁrst game of
the twin bill 5-3. the Danes faced
possible elimination from con-
ference contention in the second
contest. as they trailed l—O after ﬁve
and a half innings.

But with one down in the home
sixth, Carlos Oliveras bunted his
way on and was sacrificed to second.
.lohn lracc then legged out an inﬁeld
hit. putting mnnerson ﬁrst and third
with two outs.

With a two-strike count on

lined one into right just under the
outstretched glove of diving right-
ficlder. Art Cotugno. Oliveras
scored easily and as lracc was

also manager). Bob Burlingame.

who took the hurried relay up the
first base line. giving the Danes the
lead.

Ironically. Giulianelli‘s blast was
the only outﬁeld hit surrendered by
Cortland pitcher Garth 'l‘yrnesort
and it cost him the game. When
Albany’s John Dollard mowed
down Cortland in the seventh to
preserve his complete game victory.
it kept the Danes still mathematical-
ly alive in the SUNYAC race.
Fredonia still leads the pack with
'Albany and Cortland in a second
place tie.

“We have four losses now." said
Burlingame. "and even if we win all

three (of the remaining conference
games) we‘ll just have to wait and see
how the other team do. It's gonna
be tough!"

Tough is the only way to describe
the Danes‘ first-game loss. After the
hosts had taken a 3-2 lead in the
third. Albany starter Torn Blair saw
Cortland tie the game as a result of
an error and win the game as the
result of his own wildness.

Cortland scored ﬁrst. reaching
Blair for two second inning tallies
after one out. Bill [210 doubled off
third baseman Willoughby‘s glove
and after a sac bunt moved him to
third. scored on Cotugno‘s single up
the middle. Blair then committed a
fatal balk. Cotugno then scored

Blair’s two wild pitches with the run
that proved to be the winner.

Cortland added an insurance
marker in the next inning on a walk.
stolen base. a Blair wild throw on a
pickofl‘ attempt. and another wild
pitch. The Danes. meanwhile. could
muster no attack whatsoever as they
managed only‘one hit in the last four
innings.

The second game was a continua-
tion of the Danes' hitting woes. In
fact. Cortland's Tymeson allowed
only one hit until the fatal sixth-a
bunt single by Mark Constantine in
the third. But Albany‘s Dollard was
pitching a ﬁne game himself. Adou-
bio and rbi single in the second prov-
ed to be his only bad inning. After

from second on .lon Cooley's wind- '

blown double down the right ﬁeld
line.

Cortland‘s starter and winner Bill
Bartlett was having much better luck
with his move to first as hepicked no
less than three Danes off the bag-in
the first four innings.

And his pitching wasn‘t bad
either. In going the distance. he
whiffcd six Danes. while walking
only two and experiencing one bad
inning.

Willoughby led off with a triple
down the right field line and was still
there when Mike (iamage drew a
