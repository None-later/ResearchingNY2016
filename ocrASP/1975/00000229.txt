Last month the state legislature cut the already meager SUNY budget proposed by
Governor Carey by seven and one-half million dollars. The Albany campus was hit
harder than the other university centers. a cut 155% greater than Binghamton. 153%
greater than Stony Brook and l03% greater than Buffalo. That Albany was singled-out
when it is improving in quality at least as fast, if not faster, than the other centers is
unbelievable.

Four hundred students have written letters to their state Senators and Assemblymen
about the general S UNY cuts and those speciﬁc to this campus. SA has set up tables on
the quads and in front of the Campus Center to make it easier for students to write.
They tell the students the issues involved and inform them, ifthey don‘t know, who
their representitives are.

The cuts to A lbany‘s budget. ifenacted will be destructive not only to the educational
quality of the institution, but also to the principles of publicly—supported education.
We hope all students will write to their elected state representatives and urge them to
restore the budget cuts.

Sitting On the Carpet

In the middle of last semester. EOPSA President Fred Siokelin signed his name toa
voucher. and gave it to Sears Department Store in payment for a carpet that presently
covers the floor of the EOPSA office. Central Council voted at that time not to pay for
the carpet. partly because Stokelin‘s signature wasn‘t enough for the voucher to be
legal (it also needed SA and Univcrsityapproval)and partlybecausc the purchase itself
was considered a rather extravagant (5600) use of student tax money.

That was last semester. This semester SA President l’at Curran and Central Council
members Andy Bauman (Commuters) and Maureen DeMaio (lndian) brought the
issue back to Council because it appeared that Sears would tear up the carpet and: or
sue Stokclin. EOI’SA. or Student Association. Not that these were newdevelopmcnts.
sincc anyone could have forsccn these possibilities six months ago. What changed was
their attitude about Council's position on the matter. They are concerned that SA's
credit rating it ill sulfcr. they are concerned that the carpet will be torn up by Sears. and
they arc concerned that SA might lose a costly legal suit.

Alter hours ot debate Chairperson Lcw Fidler spoke on the issue. attacking Curran
for bringing it back when there was no pending suit and no chungcin any facts since the
last Council \‘otc. Council was convinced: the meeting rapidly ended.

'I he logic of l‘idlcr‘s position is so persuasive that it is strange that Council discussed
it for so long. and stranger still that it was brought to them.

More puuling. is the fact that Curran and the others didn‘t approach the issue of
w licthcr or not SA was rig/11 and Sears was wrong. David Coyne (Commuters) pointed
out that the voucher was clearly illegal. and Sears should not have accepted it in
payment. That didn‘t seem relevant to Curran.

But it is.

. FSA Priorities

In February the Faculty Student Association Board of Directors voted to form a
priorities committee. A committee like that put together a report in March. l97l
suggesting a philosophical direction for FSA in addition to reviewing financing
possibilities. The l97l report included whatthey considered two key questionsthat the
FSA Board must constantly answer: “ls the activity or service ofbenefit tothe students
and faculty?" and “ls the activity properly one to be supponed by FSA rather than
some other agency?“

The committee has yet to meet. for various reasons but mainly because the FSA
Itoard has been busy dealing with Student Association on issues like the board hike.
l’atroon Room. Barbershop. and membership seating. But it is these very issues that
make the priorities committee needed; it is obvious that FSA is due for another self-
cvaluation. It has improved its financial position in recent years but some have argued
that ibishas not necessarily been desireable, at least in the manner it has been achieved.

The FSA Board of Directors should put top priority on getting that committee into
operation.

Foreign Policy Reassessment

 

 

SillleCd for three decades beneath the
American military umbrella. the European
community now wants reassurance that the
fast-moving tragedy in Southeast Asia will not
precipitate a wholesale American withdrawal
from world affairs. The British government. in
tact. has rcquestcd that a regularly-scheduled
NA'IO l'oreign Ministersmccting next month
he turned into a full-fledged summit
conference. The reason: to receive guarantees
that Atncrica will honor its NATO
commitments. .

About the satnc time that the British request
was cahlcd to Washington. one of England's
most influential journals The Iz't'o/iimti'il
published aii editorial voicing fears about
what the American people would learn frotii
their disappointments in Indochina. The
editorial is interesting mostly for its errors.

The lz'i-onmntsl noted that thc United States
is now "tempted by gcncruli/cd despair about
its foreign policy" and that this temptation
"iiiust be rcsistcd." l'liccditors corrcctlycallcd
its a “ntttlcd and divided country."

llicy also expressed the hope that
Americans will ctitinue to pursue “a policy
dcsigncd to support those countrics where the
ideas of liberal and pluralist politics have
taken root. or where tlit: conditions exist in
which they might take root.“

ltiit tlic liconontist their goes on to make
two false assumptions. l‘lrsl. it declares
"There has been it largcclciticnt of ideology in
American policy tor the past 30 yucars.
because the emergence ol Soviet power after
l945 brought the issue of ideology into the
center of world politics, 'lhc United States
could have duckcd tltc issue. but only by
retiring within its own frontiers. . ."

False. We had another alternative. We
cuiild have defined our ideology differently.

Atticrica's post-war ideology was, us
defined by The Iz'i'o/iu/tii'it: anti-
communism. In the name of anti-cotnttiuniSitt
