A'SUt'e/Preview/I

' 4 A ttacking Madly!

by Jason “The Flying Rook”Brirun

As any chessplayer can tell you.
the worst possible feeling comes
from losing it won game. And where
can we take out our frustrations. by
throwing the pieces across the room.
(actually. I once hit my opponent
with my pen after running out of
time in a it easy winning position).
However. the best way isjust by kill-
ing your next opponent over the
chessboard. The following game was
played in the 4th round of last
November's Atlantic Open and I was
really pissed off at losing my
previous game. So I played for a
kingside attack from the beginning.
one of the only times l have ever
done this.
