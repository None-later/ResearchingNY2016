with many bands in the past ten years. heroin

Eric Clapton has come out with his second
album within the year, 01min Every Crowd.

ton in mellowing out the listener. There are
onlya few really upbeat tracks,and the slower.
quieter music predominates, as it did on 461
Ocean Boulevard, showing Clapton‘s new-
found quietness, and relaxation. All the
original compositions are measured and quiet.
'l‘wo spirituals open up side olle. “We‘ve
Been Told (Jesus Coming Soon).“ features
Clapton with some sparkling dobl‘o. and
Yvonne Elliman with excellent high soprano
vocals. It is a toe tripping song with a good
feeling in the music. a sharp contrast to the
words, which tell of tile collapse ol'sociely and
the arrival of Jesus. “Swing l.o\v Sweet
Chariot" is done ill a funky. original way with
a sweet, whispered harmony vocal of lilllmtln.
Carl Radle‘s bass, excellent throughout tlte
album, was exceptionally powertul and clear

The tendency on 46/ Ocean Boulevard
towards spare, short guitar runs is repeated
here. but each one is well worth the wait. On

sharp, clear. and brand new. He is not replay-
lng old music. One of the best parts of this
album is its freshness. it is new and creative:

Clapton is making music as good as he‘s ever

made. ‘ '
He‘s much more interested in the interplay
of several instnlments and voices'than in his
earlier music. There are two female vocalists,
and they are heard as often as the keyboards
and second guitar.

“Till: Sky is Crying" is an Elmore James
sollg and Clapton‘s voice sounds very blue in
the style of the great black blues singers when
he sings:

“The sky is crying.

look at the tears rolling dowll the street...

My baby left me this morning.

“Pretty Blue Eyes“ has a cha-el'la sound and
Beetle-like harmonies making it one of the

a {most irttedre‘rtiu songs on the album. Whereas

‘-the. Beatles would have thrown extras into the
vocals. Clapton fills the space with excellent
guitar, some of which was played with George
Terry.

The guitar is spare on all these songs. as are

' his vocals. Clapton cuts off his words very:‘
quickly. and sings very softly, seemingly afraid I}

of overpowering any, other- member of the
group. Hedoesn't want to step on any feet and
as he said when he was in Derek and the
Dominoes, he is just a member of the band,
Mostly, that is. Clapton definitely stands
outwhis guitar isjust too good to bury.

Building up tension and excitement at the
end of a song isa trademark ofgood music, no
matter how mellow, and the best exhibition of
that is on the last two songs of this album.
"High" and "Opposites." Clapton makes you
wait so long for the guitar soloes on these
songs that your fingers start to itell. btlt do
they shine!
