there was this time lreshman year,

tli'ilt' real, than all the years ol study,
pressure, marks, acceptance,
retraction, that came iii-between.

lt's an mipossrble question to
answer, like when my relatives ask me
how school is and lsay, "line", because
there is nothing else to say. You would
think t could come up with a better
answer alter tour years. (“‘Well, Uncle
Bob, school is exactly three parts

 

studying to two parts partying, to one
part each drinking and dope, except
when it's nice out then. . ."), but i can't.
The question still startles me.

l-low is so hoot? School, the place you
have been tor tour years. Yes, now I
remember.

Once in a very great while, it all
meant something.

Sophomore year, in a class in
Western Civilization, I had a teacher
who taught history as a great dialectic
between torces ot reason and disorder,
and made you teel the contlict like a
tug ot wargoing on inside. Ora critical
writing class with a teacher who
looked on your work as an extension of
your own intellect, not hers. The
writing itsell, even when it was tor the
ASP, and you sweated blood over each
line, only to have people come over to
you in the campus center and say, "1
liked your article. l only read ball, but it
swirled very cute." Please, please,
anything but cute. Still, it was worth it.

On one paper I wrote tor that critical

So we butld ourselves a small
enclave with a close group ot lriends,
dig in, and hope the world doesn't get
to us too much.

It must have worked in my case, tor
very little outside ever really attected
me. Somewhere in the past tour years
Vietnam was tought over and lost, a
President was removed trorn ottice,
and l got a 3.4 "grade point average,"
but 1 knew nothing about it. What I

accumulation ct knowledge,
preparation tor a career, turned out to
be an extended joke—a giant shaggy
dog story without a punchline.

I suppose 1 should teel silly and

don't apologize tor it either.

Still. 1 expected more, and the lack oi

statement to make alter tour years 0t

map,” my high school pre-college
adviser said to me, "so choose your
paths wisely in college." 1 must have
made a wrong turn along the line, or
been detoured, because my paths lead
back to the same place they started

Sitting around my a thl‘llttt‘ttl the
other night, talking With SJ bellus, the
once and tutu re Att'y at Law, we were
once again puzzling out our tuture,
trying to be seriousfl'hat tacade broke
down in a hurry. "You have a very
weird name,Stew," lmentioned to him.
"It has no connections with any thing. 1
think its religious." We said his namea
dozen times quickly, then Stew made
up a song about his name, entitled,
“Stew Bellus”, which was very catchy.
Pretty soon we were shouting it down
the block, and lwas laughing so hard,l
swear, 1 could hardly move.
