Very Little Time Left

and sadly in each other's arms.

'l’hey both knew they weren't the tirst
people ever separated, and that
millions ol people on earth were much
worse oll. 'l'hose lacts didn't console. it
just hurt so much.

by Alan D. Abbey
hey had very little time tell
I together. He had to go.
Somewhere. it didn't really
matter. . . .

She kept on worrying out loud about
"alter". He didn't worry out loud but bit
his lingers ott silently. it hadn't started
out this way, and neither at them had
loreseen they would get so close. lt just
happened.

One day they linished a project they
had been working on together. When it
was completed they just stood there
and looked at it. He linally realized
what that meant. Her large brown eyes
glowed wetty, and he pretended he
was looking tor something in his
pocket. When his eyes stopped
burning he looked up at heragain. She
was standing in the corner ol the room,
lacing the wall. He went over to her, put
his hands on her shoulders, but she
shrugged him oil with a shudder she
tell through her entire body.

"l'his is one part, one level ol our
relationship that‘s already over. i mean
we'll never be able to woik on this
together again," she said, her taco stilt
turned into the dark corrim‘ot the walls.
He just stood there, hands on her
shoulders, and bent to kiss; heron the
side at her neck.

Later that day they weretn her

apartment, lying quietly on her bed.
The only sound in the room was her
clock. it was a large windup Baby Ben,
with a round lace, which glowed pink
in the gray darkness. Each tick
sounded like a tootstep, as it someone
were Closing in, coming to take him
away. They reached out tor each other

and both spoke at the same time.

"You're so important to me."

“i love you."

They both laughed.

“Stepping on my lines again, huh?"

But it was a mirthless laugh, and it
died quickly.

"instead ol just sitting heremoping,
let's do something."

"Alright."

The trail up the mountain was not
very steep, but they took their time
anyway. The mountains around them
rose up quickly and strongly, their
rounded, snow-covered tops gleaming
like golden domes as the sun rellecled
ott them.0n their righta brook gurgled

like a happy baby, and the trees rang
with the songs ol the birds 0t spring.

Her hand gripped his tightly as they
strode their way up the incline. The
ground under their teet was sott and
dark. it was the moist, tecund earth of
the time ot spring.'l'ime was bringinga
new beginning to the lorest, but to
them time was a thielgiving them a
short time together, and then taking it
away, running past them too quickly to
be caught. They wanted to tight lime,
bend it to their wills, butthey knew that
was impossible.

“the less we sleep, the more time We
have together," she had said late one
night, while they were lying warmly

As the sun sank behind the
mountain in a burstol lire they headed
back down the trail. He glanced at his
watch—it had stopped sometime
during the day.

"What time is it?” he asked.

"Why its , .my watch has stopped
too."

'l'heir laughter echoed through the
mountain valley as they ran, hand in
hand to the waiting car.

ntlation, deﬂation, why, what
1 this country needs is tlationt"
Samuel Jason Lyman, a.k.a.
Betting Sam, is a sell-proclaimed
philosopher, wealthy, unemployed 78-
yearpld who spends his Mondays
through Saturdays swapping stories
and placing wagers with the boys at
Schenectady's Oil Track Betting

Parlor.

On Sundays, Sam rests.

"l'he Lord didn't make me a time-
clock pusher,"says Sam, “1 never
worked cause 1 never liked work. Too
many bosses and rules and
backaches, that’s all work is. Besides, i
don’t need no income, never did. i
make my money here, saler and more
tun this way. And Uncle Sam don't
know nothing about me."

it Betting Sa‘m appears to be loose on
logic, you better check with his
accountant before you accuse him of
speaking with forked tongue about his
consistent and rewarding success
playing the horses.

Fact is Sam Lyman is the most
respected handicapper on the Central
Avenue premisis. lit". Hutton would
marvel at the attention the old man
receives on his way to the mutual
booth.

"l tigure i made about $15,0(JU or
$20,000 last year, never belting more
than $50 at a time, " Sam says, ldon't
claim to be no prophet or no lOl'ltliie-
letter. 1 just tollow my hunches, live
clean and don't eat no meat on
lridays.“

belore you stop Cheating on your
wrle and invite Ch’irley the 'l'una to
dinner at the end 01 each week, let
Betting Sam tell you a tew more
palpable items which might also have
something to do with his success.

"livery morning lget up at 7 and eat
breaktast while looking at my Hacing
Form, my Armstrong, my 'l‘rackman,
my Mirror, and my 'l'out Sheet."

Alter interrupting Sam here to
wonder it all those dailies were "lood
tor good thought,” he raised his
walking-cane in salute and began

laughing Violently.

'l hat sounds like something my tirst
wrto Would say. Whata lady. You know,
i married Clara on a Saturday night.
that attui'noon i made $120 betting on
a horse named Death Sentence. the
horse that imished second was My
Hi‘lrlt»: Clara."

Anyway, Sam Lyman works harder
at liis trade than most horseplayers,
ospocially ones his age.

1 spt-énd my mornings going over
my «rharts, looking tor that one nag to
set my day right. I take out a lew
minutes to walk my hound, Sham, and
to watch Jeopardy on 'l'V. l neverlose.l

 

 

always bet everything 1 got in Final
Jeopardy. it's more exciting that way."

By12245 Sam is sitting in his tavorite
green beach chair, stroking his snow-
white beard, in his beat~upllanne| shirt
with the button missing, his "Shelter
Bay Country Club” straw hat
supporting him on top and his
plattorm, orthopedic shoes on bottom.
By 12t5 he lights up his tamous El
Producto and leans back to enjoy the
company that gathers in the cramped
betting area.

"No doubt about it, l'm the king
around here," he says with no talse
pride, "And why not. 1 can hit60ut ot9

races easily, every day. l was the one
who predicted Cordero would burn
Aqueduct up last week."

A check ot leading jockeys at the
New York track shows Angel Cordero
with 22 wins in 45 mounts, an
incredible teat.

"i like Angel, l like the way he seems
to know when to ask a horse to run. 1
used to watch Angel in the paddock.
to say, "Hey, Angel, mi amigo, wrn-o
this one-o por tavor," and Angel'd just
laugh and say, "Anything tor you,
5am,"

Betting Sam doesn't make it to the
track anymore. His worsening leg
condition—he calls it, "My
handicapper's handicap"—restricts
him to his short walk With Sham as his
only exorbise.

"People see me on the streets with
my cane and they think, Look at that
old man, living on social security and
memories.‘ Well, when i come here
(Uillti) i make it my busniess to scollat
those young wliippersnappers when l
tlasli my Winning ticketsaround. 'l'hen
they risk, they old man, whose gonna
Win the next race, and l tell em, See
that booth down the hall Willi the :itqlt
that says, lNl‘UHMA‘l'lON, qo ask
theni' ”

A quick Wit has always been a
tmdotnark in Betting Samscharacler.

About tips and lixes he says, “'l‘here
ain t no Stitili thing as a sure bet, I only
tip my harbor and a boat race is a
contest tor outboards on the Hudson."

llow long will he keep betting? He
laughs. “Has Hank Aaron retired lrom
baseball, Fred Astaire lrom pictures or
Hobert Moses tioin building cities?"

And how does Sam Lyman see
himselt titling into this world ot ours?
"l'in the guy who shows everybody
that you don't have to be young or
good-looking or have legs that work or
a job you like or a nice lamtly or be
very smart to enjoy this lite. lust do
what you like to do and you'll be
happy. Like me."
