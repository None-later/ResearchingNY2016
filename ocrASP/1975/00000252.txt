dent needs to establish a rapport
with the administrators in order to
get things accomplished. She feels
that she has established such a rap-
port with many of the administrators
by realizing that “there is a human
being there“ even though he has cer-
tain' administrative duties to per-
form.

Salant stated, “The president and
the vice-president are worlds apart.“
Salant sees improved com-
munications between the two top ex-
ecutive positions as instrumental in
SA‘s future success as a governing
body. Salant added. ‘lt‘s between
Mr. Levenson and Mr. Meckler and
I feel I can work very easily with
eitherone of them. I've had extensive
discussions with them already.”

Wax stressed the idea that
members of student government
shouldn't “hassle over internal af-
fairs.“ Wax indicated that he would
establish a more “informal tone“ in
student government. “I do things a
bit differently," he explained. "I
would put more reliance in the peo«
ple l delegate responsibility to. This
way. more things get done. the
students are served better and
receive more attention.“

O‘Brien feels that the presidency
should be more “open.” “People like
to be able to get a hold of the presi-
dent." he commented. “I‘m the only
candidate who is living on campus.
The president should make sure that
he knows what‘s going on in the
groups. Communication is the im-
portant thing.”

Bauman was also concerned with
the communicative struggles which
hamper SA‘s efficiency. “My main
job as president would beto open the
lines of communication within SA to

'the administration. the Faculty-
' Student Association, EOPSA. and

other groups in SA.“ Bauman
further stated that he would strive
for a “tight feeling within SA that we
are f riends." He feels that this would
encompass a full time devotion to
problems as “friends. not political
adversaries."

Mecklersummed up SA's troubles
this year as problems of “com-
munication and organization." “No
one was really getting together on
issues." he commented. “What we
had was a lot of politicians running
around playing politics, but little
work getting done.“ Meckler feels
that there is a need to get together
more with the student groups.

While realizing that the vice-
president must be responsive to the
needs of the students. Meckler was
quick to point out that there are cer-
tain limitations to this respon-
siveness. according to his way of
thinking. “You get to know parts of
issues that students don‘t know
about. In representing the student
interest you have a certain respon-
sibility to say what the average stu-
dent wants. On some issucsyou have
to go above that. but you are still
responsible for justifying your
decisions to the students."

Levenson feels that SA needs
more feedback from the student
body. He believes that the present
student government is not respon-
sivc enough to the students‘ needs.
chenson thinks that he can make
the vice-p residency work to increase
communications between students
and government. “AsOmbudsman.”
he explained. “I‘ve learned a lot
about how SA works and how the

school works. The vice-president‘s
job is to work with the groups and

Of the eight presidentialand vice-

chose to criticize their opponents.
Those who chose not to were Kim
Kreiger. Nathan Salant. Bob
O'Brien. Ken Wax. and Jon Leven-

them referred to such tactics as
"mudslinging" and “a cheap way to

' Andy Bnuman felt it was his
responsibility to criticize his op~

will?"

In reference to Ken Wax, Bauman
thoughtfully remarked. “l have to

PRESIDENTIAL SHAFT-

New York‘s Village Voice
newspaper reports that future Un-
ited States Presidents may be given a
big shaft.

The Voicesaysthata Washington.
D.C.. contractor is designing a new
method of protecting the President
in the event of a nuclear attack. The
design under study is reportedly a

6000-foot elevator shaft that would
carry the chiefexccutive morethan a
mile below the earth‘s surface in six
minutes‘ time.

The present plan to cope with a
nuclear emergency is to rush the
President through a series oftunnels
and rapid exit facilities to Andrews
Air Force Base. Once there. the
President would climb aboard a so-
cullcd “doomsday flight machine"~—
tl jet equipped with sophisticated
radar equipment and military coni-
mand facilities. He would then be
flown out to the stratosphere to con-
duct the US. side of the war.

The Voice says that the shaft is be-
ing proposed because military
strategists fear the President might
not have enough time to get aboard
an airplane before the-first bombs
hit Washington.

As it result. strategists are cott-

sidering the construction of the
bOOO-foot-dccp shaft directly under
the White House that would enable
the President of the U.S. to survivca
direct bombing hit at 1600 Penn“
sylvanitt Avenue.
One problem. the Voice says. is that
the shaft will require the President to
descend at the rate of [000 feet per
minute. The Newspaper reports that.
at that speed. the President may
reach the bottom in such a dizzy
state ltc will be unable to make
coherent decisions about the proper
military response.

Haven’t you
enough to '
worry about?

Then why not eliminate at
least one needless worry
—your family‘s security? I
can help you with a com-
mon sense protection pro~

BOUNCING BEARS

The builders of the Alaskan
pipeline complain that wild animals
are becoming a nuisance if not a ma-
jor problem to construction
workers. '

A project supervisor. Vern Davis.
reports that at some camps. fuel oil is
stored outdoors in large rubber
bladders that hold up to 50.000
gallons.

These tanks are now being fenced
in. Davis says. because bears have
discovered the tanks made great
trampolines. Davis says that the
bears began showing up every mor-
nittg to bounce and tumbleon them.

CHAVEZ FOLLOWED

The secretary-general of the
World Conference Trade Unions has
charged that representatives frorn
the American Teamsters Union
followed Cesar Chavezofthc United
Farm Workers Union around Eu-
rope during Clittvcz‘s recent tour.

Chavez was in England to
organize support there for the
U.F.W.‘s boycott of California
grapes and lettuce.

Jean Bruck. the secretary-general
of the Brussels-based labor con-
federation. says that 'I'ctmistcrs of-
ficials made specific threats against
the Swedish Trade Union Con-
federation.

Bruck states that thc‘ 'l'c'ar'h‘slcrs H

representatives warned that support
of the U.F.W. boycott in Sweden
could result in the Teamsters block-
ing the exportofallVolvo curstothc
United States.

Bruck says that despite the
reported threats. the Swedish Con-
federation which has voted to sup-
port Chnvez‘s boycott "does not
seem to have been intimidated.“

The World Confederation of
Labor which Bruck coordinates is
composed of labor affiliates in more
than 25 countries in Europe and
Latin America.

NUCLEAR POWER BAN

In what may be a significant vic-
tory for environmentalists. The
Powerful Australian Metal Workers
Union has announced it will ban all
uranium mining and nuclear power
development throughout Australia.

The Amalgamated Metal
Workers Union said it was taking the
unitsqu ll‘lcilSlIl'L' because the nuclear
power industry has been unable to
prove that using nuclear energy is

The union stated that it.had not
seen any evidence that handling
uranium was safe. saying that “on
the basis of evidence available now
the uranium should be left in the

ground." The union also stated it ob- ,

jected to a facts of information on
how radioactive wastes can be safely
stored. ‘-

Thc powerful union would have
been the one responsible for mining
and processing all uranium for the
nuclear industry in Australia. If an-
nounced. instead. that members
would begin working with the
Australian Conservation Founda-
tion to publicize the hazards of

rape trrid are horrified.“ He says tlrttt
these callerer re counseled. and some
are referred to professional

Met/.ger says that "Men Organiz-
ed Against Rape“ offers advice to
men because the belief that a man‘s
wife or girlfriend is his personal
property leads many men to seek
revenge
