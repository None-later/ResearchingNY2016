PRO-NIXON RECORD

Wamer Brothers Records has
decided to test Richard Nixon's
appeal by marketing a pro-Nixon
record on a national scale.

The company has just purchased
the rights to a 45-record cut by a
Tennessee optician named Stephen
Adams. The record consists of
Adams talking about the greatness
of Richard Nixon, with a chorus of
his friends and patients following
along in the background to the tune
of the “Battle Hymn of the
Republic." played on the steel guitar.

The record which has been played
on the air in Chattanooga has
created a sensation there. One radio
station there was forced to set aside
an hour for phone calls in order to
clear the phone. litres. many of them
happy. but others outraged.

N E RC
MISREPRESENTED

A University of Florida professor
is out with the report that Nero did
not fiddle while Rome burned.

Doctor Gareth Schmcling says
that. first of all. fiddles had not even
been invented in Nero‘s time. In ad-
dition. the professor says. Nero was
not even in Rome when the fire
broke out but was. instead. 50
miles away. ‘lnthcr than fiddle.
Professor Schmeling adds. Nero
rushed back to the city in order to aid
the victims.

Schnicling claims that Nero is one
at the most maligned figures in
history. and blames his poor
historical image on “a bad press.“

Haven’t you 
enough to 
worry about? 

Then why not eliminate at
least one needless worry
—your family's security? i
can help you with a com-
mon sense protection pro-
gram that gives you the life
insurance protection you
need and can afford now,

monthly check for years
and years,

More and more thoughttul

The professor says that Nero
received a bad press because most of
the available records about the
Roman emperor were maintained by
Christians: Christians. he explains.
simply did not like Nero.

ANOTHER COVER-UP?

Former CIA executive assistant
Victor Marchetti is suggesting there
was a high—level government cover-
up | l years ago to conceal the fact
that President Kennedy was the vic-
tim of an assassination conspiracy.

Marchetti, a highly-placed ﬁgure
in the CIA for l4 years, says he now
suspects that elements within the
government were involved in the
JFK assassination. Marchetti
resigned from the agency in I969.

The former CIA official reports in
the current edition of Truemugazine
that he attended a series of briefings
at CIA headquarters when a New
Orleans investigation into the
assassination was discussed.

He says that top CIA officials-—»
including the then-director Richard
lielmsr were deeply concerned
about the probe into .IFK‘s death be-
ing headed by New Orleans District
Attorney .lim Garrison. Garrison
was charging that two men MDavid
l'crrie and Clay Shawﬁehad plotted
with Lee Harvey Oswald and others
to assassinate President Kennedy.

Marchetti reports that the CIA
was worried that the public would
learn about secret connections
between the‘agency and both Shaw

and Ferric. Marchettisuys thatagen-~

cy officials would talk about the
probe “in half sentences“ while he
was in the room. He says when the
assassination was discussed. they
would add: “We‘ll talk about it later
’(in private)."

Marchetti states: “The more I
have teamed. the more concerned I
have become that the government
was involved in thcassassination of
President John F. Kennedy."

WAKEMAN ON ICE

A&M Records is confinning
reports that Rick Wakeman is put-
ting together a rock version of the
King Arthur legend—eon ice.

Wakeman‘s ice capadc show will
reportedly have him playing the part
of Merlin the magician. with the en-
tire production set to Rick's music.
"'lhc Myths and Legends of King

Arthur and the Knights of the‘Rou-

nd Table.”

Plans call for a cast ofat least I50
ice skaters. A&M claims that
Wakeman has even located horses
that can skate.

HARMFUL HAIR DYES

A University of California
biochemist is out with a report that
possibly links hairdyes to cancerand
birth defects.

Doctor Bruce Amcs. a researcher
with the National Academy of
Sciences. reports testing I69 hair
dyes used commonly by at least 20
million Americans.

Amcs states that at least I500fthe
hair dyes were found to have
chemicals which caused genetic
mutation in bacteria samples they
were tested on. According to the
doctor. the same chemicals which
cause genes in bacteria to mutate
also have a high probability of calls-
ing cancer in humans.

Ames is recommending that large
scale tests be conducted to determine
whether 20 million Americans who
dye their hair are risking the
possibility of developing cancer or
passing birth defects on to their
children.

OLYMPIC SPIES

Former CIA agent Phillip Agec
has charged that one of the fronts
used by the agency is the Olympic
Games Organizing Committee.

Agce says that while he was an
agent in Mexico in I968. he worked
with the Olympic Committee to
recruit foreign athletes as potential
spies. He adds that the committee
also monitored the activities of
various foreign officials.

Agec says that following the I968
Olympic games in Mexico City. he
checked CIA tiles and found that the
agency‘s practice of using the Olym-
pic Comrnittcc dated back until at

Class of '75!

FUTURE LEISURE LIFE
The U .8. Forest Service has polled
experts in Biology. the environment.
and population dynamics to predict .
what leisure activity and outdoor life
will consist of through the next 75

Here's what the Forest Service is
now predicting:

-By I985. the number of people
pcmiitted to use ‘wildcrness areas"
will be restricted. and the govern—
ment will pay private landowners to
open up their land to recreation.

-By 1990. public outdoor areas
will be paved with ‘wcar-rcsistant"
footpaths and lined with electronic
guide systems and fences. Overnight
camping will be limited only to those
with reservations.

SEX SURVEY

relations with their students.

In the survey. 350 questionnaires
were circulated to teaching assistants
and professors. and IS percent of
these were filled out and returned.
Twenty percent of those responding
admitted to having sexual relations
with their students.

NO TAXES,

The township of Skippack. Penn- I

sylvania. has discovered a novel way
to get rid of the property tax:

Thanks to a bit federal revenue
sharing check. the township has
done away with the tax. The federal
government has been pumping in
sileable revenue sharing payments
to Skippack after ﬁnding that nearly
one-third of the local residents have
annual incomes below the poverty
level.

It turnsout.that most ofthose suf-
fering from poverty in Skippack
happen to the the l500 inmates ofthc
state prison there.

Since the government counts the
inmates in its census suerys. the
township receives the extra money.
The prisoners. as usual. lose out:
they don‘t get a dime from the
revenue sharing check.

ANKA’S OBSESSION

The target of criticism from the
woman‘s movement over his song
“You‘re Having My Baby" says he‘s
about to write an even more con-
troversial tune.

Anka says he‘s been so upset by
the outcry against his song that he's
“seriously considering" writing a
strong anti-abortion number. The
name of ltis new tune. it he writes it.
will be “You‘re Killing My Baby“.
Anka says.

Anka says that the abortion song
will be sung to the tune of "You‘re
Having My Baby“.
