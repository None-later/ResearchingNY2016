VALBANY STUDENT PRESS * * EXECUTIVE RACES FOR 1975-1976 * 7k APRIL 29, I975

 

I. ,  . - ~ - n \ Thioueollod us i

During the next four days students on this campus are going to decide who wig . . ‘ ' ' ‘
distributeand manage their tax money, who will represent them to the school and , unmme'
Community, and who will be responsible for sensing what they need and what could
endanger them. It is not the kind of election that electrifies the soul. but judging from
past turn-outs this election will be about as important to SUNYA students as the
national elections are to the country. Though apathy is still the major characteristic at
college campuses. Albany has among the most active and powerful student bodies in
the nation.‘A lot of power goes into the hands of those who will be elected this week.
Insure that they represent you. Vote.

Ken Wax For President

In years past Student Association has increased its internal efficiency and extemai
reputation. Pat Curran has used both these qualities for action and innovation. Much
ofthis year‘s activism was misdirected, but there is a growing sense of student power on
this campus that needs direction. Next year‘s SA president must have the good
judgement to decide when and where student power is sensibly used and where it is
useless. Ken Wax hits this good judgement.

Wax is intelligent. confident. and able to communicate with both students arid
administrators. He understands what moves people. how to persuade, and the right
times to act.

The summer months are particularly important because SUNYA will have a new
president. Dr. Emmett 8. Fields from the University of Houston. whose trust in
stttdertt government will depend almost entirely on the first impression he receives of '
responsible student leaders. Unlike any other candidate. Wax can present a clear-
thinking and consistant line of reasoning. Wax will carefully establish his position.
using his understanding of what is sensible artd will adhere to it. No administration. no
community. and no student group will respect a president who is unclear about his own
opinions and who cannot quickly see the essential poirti of art issue. Wax as president
would be the antithesis of this.

He Itas the ttcadernic background irt business and the practical experiences of
chairing Central Council‘s most important committee. Finance Committee. Wax
would represent students well because he is a real student. in contact with the daily
lives of students artd not limited to seeing the world through the eyes of .2 Slur-em
Association. t

Ken Wax can be open artd accessablc. firm. silent, or vocal. as the occasion demands.
The Albany Student Press endorses hint for the SA presidency.

Rick Meckler For Vice President

in the space of a few short months. Rick Meckler has proven his devotion to
students‘ rights and deep cornmittment to making SUNYA a better place at which to .

get an education.

Down the Peking Rood

 

Two weeks ago Gerald Ford annouttccd
that he would be going to China this coming
fail. The presidency is certainly liberalizing
the fomicr Houscntinority lcadcrflihough it
may be odd fora conservative like Ford to
want to plan such a trip. it‘s a politically
logical move. With conservatives and
Republicans in his camp he must now prove
himself to more liberal factions if ltc hopes to
broaden his base and win the I976
presidential election. A visit to the People's
Republic is one way of aehievirtg this goal.

But above itnd beyond President Ford‘s
own personal political motives. his grip is
reassuring front a national perspective. For
once we're doing something rigltt in the
realm of foreign policy. After twenty—six
years we scent ready to sever diplomatic ties
with Taiwan in favor of formal links with
mainland China » this perhaps coining iii the
fall when President Ford visits Peking.

One benefit of otir retrewed rciatiorts with
mainland China is the fact that this country
is finally willing to develop and strengthen
art international relationship on the basis of
existing world realities. without trying to
alter those realities to fit otir scheme of
thinking. Ich can develop links between all
the peoples of the world. cvcrt those people
we disagree with. we might just find the
billions of dollars spent on armaments to be
wholly unnecessary. Weapons used to kill.
not so ritticit other human beings. but rather
agents of foreign cultures. We find it
necessary to kill thcrrt because foreign
cultures threaten our national ego. How can
any people no! live with American cirititral
idciils‘.’

()ite reality which we must realile is that it
nation cannot impose its own form of
government. oti anyone else. There are
definite cultural differences between

by David Troeger .

different countries artd governments
sornctlting we should have now learned from
our experience in Indochina. A realization ol
this fact ntigltt well explain our shilt front
'I‘aipai to Peking. Instead ol an rilool
ignorance of tire largest nation in the world
we seem ready to coexist with the
Communist Chinese. :1 sign that the US
possibly no longer lives with the delusion ot
forcing itsclfon the rest of the world. Allct' a
quarter cetttttry our national mentality
hopefully is now taking the higher road oi
intcmational maturity.

International rrraturity among nations is
the ability to live with those whom you hate
differences with. it is a most infantile
attitude to believe that the whoicworld must
have tltc same outlook as you r be it that the
wltoieworid be white or that the whole world
be non-communist. 'l'hat isjust riot the on)
things are. it is rtot dealing with actualiircs.

Alter Indochina we should be able to see
that military force very much represents an
act of nationalarrogance. 0n the otltcr hand
politicril cooperation and bargaining ttct as
the alternative tools to be used irt an age oi
coexistence. In such it" age. we have the
ability to establish. in Richard Nixon's
words. “a structure of peace." an age trt
which continiuttcnt through agrcciitcnt. and
understanding throtiglt friendship will
thwart arty attempts at hostilities.

I'ltotigli American foreign [ItiIiL‘) has
lately experienced setbacks on many fronts.
we at least scent willing to continue on a
positive course with tltc world‘s two othcl
superpowers: the People's Republic of L'hllu|
aitd ilrc Soviet Uiiiott. l‘irst President I‘ttlti
meets with Leonid lire/ltrrcv III Russia and
now he plans it trip to China; a heartening
situation irt light of the iitthroglio we'tc been
“wine lnlciy in most every corner of the
world.
