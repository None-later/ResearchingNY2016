Is there a difference between one
candidate and the next? Will one
candidate bring us the Beatles in
concert. free. itnd another build a
subway between Alumni Quad and
the Campus Center? Not very likely.
The SA President does not make
policy. The SA Presidetit does not
even cast a vote on how your tax
ittotiey is spertt. 'l‘hrit is the job of
Central Cotiiicil. So when eart-
didates for SA President or Vice-
President makeprornisesol' financial
revision they oitly tell you tltat they
do itot kitow vvltat thejob eitiiiils or
tltcy tire tryiitg to fool tlte voters with
promises tltey carttiot keep.
Positions on the "issues" a re. iii that
respect. relativer meaningless. 'I'Itc
only real issttc is whether or not a
candidate will do the job.

Ilowevcr. the voters cannot he ex-
pected to take a candidate‘s word as
to whether or nothe/shcwill do the
job. the only way to be stire is to
check the record. In my past years iii
the Student Association I have serv-
ed iii numerous positions ranging

. from SASU Coordinator to Central
Council member. In every one of
these positions I have worked l‘ortbe
students to the best of ray ability. I
have never resigned from one posi-
tiott in order to seek another.

While on Central Council. I Iiave
been one of the most active members
introducing bills that became policy.
ranging from the Rathskcller to the
reorganization of SASU here at
SUNYA. When the N.Y.S.
LegislatUre cut SUNYA‘s budget. I
organized a letter writing campaign
to gain support fora restoration of
the original appropriation. At
various times throughout my years
here I‘ve fought on the students'
behalfwitb the Administration. the
ISA. Central Council. iind the
N.Y.S. Legislature.

I support and urge the passage of
both the NYI’IRU and tlte niatt-
datory tax relerendtitns on the
ballot. NYI’IRU is an idealistic
group with rcalistic tactiCs. 'Ihey
conlronl issties in the public's in-
lercst arid back it up with hard work.

the question of mandatory tax is
also facing the students iii this elec-
tion. 'Ihe concept of a mandatory
tax is essential torall ol us. Without
it. we lose lttnds to sttpport concerts.
movies. AM IA. ASP. and
cvcrytlting else the Student A ssocia-
tion now sponsors. II it is voted on
by the students and distributed by
their representatives. it s a
justit'iableand necessary practice.

In Central Cotincil anil oit budget
comtttittce l Itavc always been it
strong advocate ol student oricittcd
programs such as AMIA. inter-
collegiate sports. NYI'IRU. I-ive
Quad Ambttlancc Service.and Quail
Boards.

Surrounded by campaign
rhetoric. the student votcr has only

one sure placcto itiru. lo the record.
Look at all the candidates' records
and then decide.

First ofall. let me state that lam it
very serious candidate for the office
of SA President. I feel that a carn-
piiigit should Iiave its lighthearted
moments as well as its more serious
ones. Having served in the last tvvo
executive branches. | Itavc been ex—
posed to a lot of the strengths uml
weaknesses inherent in a student
government. I cart deal with crises
saticly asa result of tltiscoristani ex-
postire to them. I know from ex-
perience that the excctrtivc branclt
must be strongand tightly knit. btit
also itittst work closely with the roost
powerful braitclt ol' sttrdctit
government Central Council. l
have prepared amendments to the
Constitution which. I feel. can steer
its towards this goal.

Different lactions aitd iittcrcst
groups need tribe better represented.
I believe strongly in self-
dctemiiniition. local rate. and deceit-
tralization in the budgetary process.
‘I his would lead toward a more
representative budget with activities
improving as a direct result.

During my time iii the executive
branch. I have become fantiliarwitlt
many administrators and their func-
tions. lean deal with them very effec-
tively without beingtotally won over
to their way of thinking. I‘ve learned
through many mistakes when to
question and criticize. liilso want as
muclt student input as possible.
given the bad taste students seem to
Itavc for SA. I hope to improve its
visibility and change its image
through a face till.

I think next year is going to be the
toughest year faced by this school in
many. many years. The only way to
overcome the physical and spiritual
dcprcssiott we‘re all bound to feel is
by offering a wide variety of good
initss prograntming to help its forget
our troubles. if only tor a short
period ot'iimeﬁl'hebasicdil'l'ercnecs.
prejudices. and suspicioits we all feel
towards one another will still be
tltere btrt maybe. in this iirnc of
crisis. we can try to help each other.

My campaign is an attentpt to

As SA president. I will dedicate
myself to making the office an

I am calling for a student-

By running for Student Associa-
tion President I wish to tnakethe stu-
dent government morc open and
responsive to the students. While I
Wits working for Pat Curran this year
I found that tnorc and more he was
becoming isolated from the students.
People came to the office with
questions arid Icl't without the
answers to their questions. I would
like to establish a rttore opcit arid
cl'l'ective administration. one that
answers questions and gives people
confidence in student government‘s
ability to help and represent them. I
would \\‘illtl to establish ol'lice ltoiirs
lttt’ S.i\.at niglttdnring tltcwcek iiitd
to be around the ollicc dtirirtg the
day. llte people I ltave working [or
S.A. next ycarwill be tltosevvlto wislt
to help students.

Next year I will be the only can-
didiiie who will livcon campus. lwill
adopt the policy that my door will
always be open to anyone with a
problem. Living on campus has its
advantages. It makes the President
accessible to the large amount of
students who live on campus and
also to commuters and those who
live on the downtown campus. I lecl
that by living on campus I will be ex-
periencing the same problems and
trustrations as the on-utmpus
students.

I feel that the president should
make sure that every student gets Itis
lair share out ol'bis mandatory.tax.
To achieve this objective I plan to
review the budget that Central
Council passes and recommend
revisions to assure each student his
fair share. Some groups have been
favored too long. others have been
short-changed even though they
serve a large amount of the student
body efficiently. ’art of the
.‘I hit funding of groups is the
IICLLSSII)’ ol' the money to fund them.
'Iherclorc I urge every student to
vote yes on the niattdatory tax
referendum. One group wltose futi-
ding is 'scntial to students arid cott-
stiriters is NYI’IRG. l Itopc that
every sitidcitt will vote yes on the
NYI’IR(i question.

By way ol introduction. my name
is Clary Bennett and Iain runnmgt'or
'l SASU;SIIIUL‘III Assembly
Delegate position. My campaign
slogan "Bennett lot You itt
S.A.S.U. expresses my deep desire
to represent you in S.A.S.U. I
believe deeply itt S.A.S.U.‘s poten-
tial to obtain pcrmattcnt victories for
the 150.000 State University of New
York students.

Since coitting to Albany State. I
ltave been actively involved in
SASU Sttident Assembly. Last tall I
attended tltc Iircdonia SASU Cort—
l’erencc as a representative/ observer
lrom Central Council. I’ltis spring I
attended tltc SASU legislative con-
t’ercncc at the State Capitol arid lob-
bycd against the Albany State
budget cuts. I also worked on the re-
ccrtt legislative letter writing citin-
paign.

SASU-lobbying arid services is it
great idea. lit the last lew years

' I has gained the respect ol tltc
.\.\ .S. legislature as a lobbying
organi/ation. lltit its scrv ice areas
are still weak. becatise til it lack ol
adcqtiatc promotion. I feel that I
could do art ellcctive job coor—
dinating arid promoting SASU ser-
vices oit this campus. I lccl that a
ilclcgatc‘s duty goes beyond atten-
ding coiiletcitces oit sttidcnts‘
money. lbclievc that activedelcgate
eotilcrenees atttl
will be the key to
Itiiliiic ot

oit this campus

SASU.

I lcel that my record ot ptisi iii-
volvcnteiit in various areas of Sitt-

provides evidence of the dedicatiort
that I would prov idc iisyour full tititc

(wrth In)

In the two years that I ltavebccit iii
Albatty. I have itivolv ed mysell with
the Strident Association. I have
become lamiliar with just about
every aspect of student lite on this
caitiptis through my participation in
Central Couitcil. University Senate.
Student Affairs Council. iiivd
through my other personal cx-
pcriertccs.

SASU prov ides ritarty serv icesartd
functions tor Albany and I believe
these scr\ iccs should be ritiide more
readily available to the students.
But. it is also my lecliiig that the
ittititt role ol SASU next vear will be
to build a strongcrawiii'cnessattiong
tltc university comittunity. that
students are art important part ot
tltis school iittd tltcrelore should
have air important role tn dccidiitg
the policies that cllect this universi-
ty‘. As htttttitit beings. we have this
iigltt ot deciding how we should lead
our lives.

sincerity. that l aiti wtlltiig iiitd

ttitivc to SASI‘.

I'm l.ittilit Kabooltiin iiitd I am
seeking rc-election as our campus ‘
representative to SASU and the Stu-
dent Assembly. lhis year. its it
delegate. I was elected by ilte
delegate body to the executive com-
ittittce ol botlt orgiitti/ations. and I
served as the chairperson ot thc‘comn
iniinications and the by-lavvs and in-
corporation cotnittiltees I helped
organize the demonstration against
the threatened room rcnt hike
proposed by the Chancellor to the
Board ol | rttstccs. I have also been
involved with cllorts towards all'tr-
ntiitivc action lor‘ strident
govcrnmertts iiitd for SA SU.

My three rttajor areas ol concern
are Itiglt quality public educational
the lowest cost tor tltc greatest
ittimber ol people. Ihc budget cttts
our school is lacing iltreaten to lovvei
the quality ol our education by rais-
ittg the ratio ol the number of
students per liiciilty member. and by
eliminating all growth lrom our
programs. lltcsc ctttsmay also mean
an increase iit our lees which may
prevent stiidcitts from attending
college. We are also avva re that there
is instittitioitiilt/ed prejudice against
rnirtority iiitd women students itt ad—
missions procedures and financial
aid.

llte niiijoi' responsibility of the
representative is to voice the con-
certts ol SUNY students to the
Chancellor. tltc Legislature. and the
Board ol l'tirstees. this year I have
attempted to do iliisiutd lhiive seen
our eatnpus remobilize to take u
stand on these vital issues and show
the strength of our numbers.
