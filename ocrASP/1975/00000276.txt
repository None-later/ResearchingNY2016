Extended Weekend §  Servic

by Sunn Michael

Off-campus students and those
living on Alumni Quad ofteh feel,
not without cause, that the bus
schedule imposes an unfair curfew.
After a substantial amount of work
the Off-Campus Student Life Com-
mittee of Central Council has
arranged with the Capital District
Transit Authority to run additional
buses on Friday and Saturday nights
for the rest of the semester.

the original bill requested $270
from SA Operating to subsidize the
service. 'I‘axpaying riders wottldhavc
been charged 25c and non-tax
payers would be chargcd40c. There
was also an appropriation ol'S40 to

at your campus

advertise the new service.

The bill was amended to eliminate
the charge for taxpayers. If the de-
mand for these late night buses
makes itselfapparetit, thereisagood
possibility that the administration
will ntn late buses beginning next
semester. This was told to Stu
Simon. who has been instrumental.
itt setting up the late night bttses. by
Frank Kopl‘. the Director of Plant
Administration. The buses will stop
at tltc circle and at Partridge and
Western only.

buses that will run on May 3. 4, It).

The Off-Campus Student Com-
mittee requests students to
remember that this service will be
continued only if it is patronized.

The rationale for the new bus
schedule is to alleviate the
“Cinderella curfew“ that has long
hampered students living down-
town. With the new schedule in
effect. off-campus studcttts and
Alumni Quad residents will not be
required to leave on-campus movies
and other functions early in order to
catch a bus downtown.

By the same, token students living
uptown will be able to stay down-
town until the later hours without
being stranded.

The bill was largely a product of
Central Cottttcil member Gary
Bennett's efforts. Bennett created
and tabulated a survey on Alttmtti
Quad last March. “The results ot~
that survey showed that there would
be justification [for late bttscsl."

posed by ltighly advanced
civili/ations in space.

The maga/ine. in its May issue,
says that liarth scientists with their
newly-developed radio telescopes
ttow have the ability to aim their im-

‘ strunients toward nearby stars and

possibly to listen in on other in-
telligent beings communicating with
each other. r

the .\ational Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA)
recenth proposed a Sltl billion
(dollar) project dubbed “I’rojcct
Cyclops“that would employ an array
of radio telescopes to earcsdrop on
the stars around us.

NASA figures indicate that with
Sit) billion (dollars). we could
systematically attenth to detect in-
telligent signals from a tttillion near-
by stars over a period of 30 years.

'I‘here's one catch. however: the
magazine says that its very possible
that advattccd civilizations don‘t
want us to know they’re out there.
xts/runolirr says that it ex-
traterrestial beings are. in tact.
responsible for the thousands of
tJ.I-.(). sightings over the past 30
years. there‘s a good chance they are
deliberately hiding their existence
trout us.

It is suggested that this is one
reason he time not yet been able to
detect intelligent radio signals beatn-
ed Irom other civilizations in space-
bccausc we are the victims ofa rodio
blackout.
