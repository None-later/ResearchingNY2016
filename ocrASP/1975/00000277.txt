Time To Come in From The Cold

 

A quick survey of some 30 representative
American newspapers reveals that all but two
support a normalization of trade and
diplontatic relations with Ctiba. Public
opinion polls show that a majority of the
American people wrinta warming up towards
our 90-mileaway neighbor. And more
politicians seem to be tracking to Cuba for
pictures with Fidel Castrothan are lining up to
prise with Gerald Ford.

What seems to be taking place. is a
fundamental shift in the popular attitude
toward our little island neighbor.

It all happened very quickly. In fact. Cuba‘s
disappearance front the list of controversial
political issues here iii the United States took
place faster than the collapse of the South
Vietnamese army and almost as fast as the
Secretary of State‘s fall frotn grace.

And that is why. in light of the present low
state of his prestige. Kissinger‘s ambivalent
attitude toward Cuba is puzzling. Everybody
except him seems to have seen the grail. So far
he remaitis aloof and Hamlet-like. postponing
a decision on what to do about Cuba.

Perhaps recent failures have made him gutt-
shy. At this writing. step by step diplomacy in
the Middle East Itas been abandoned. the
governments of South Vietnam and
Cambodia hriVe fallen. Portugal is Iurching

leftward. Cyprus remains divided. Greece.

lives under a repressive dictatorship. and
Thailand wants U.S. troops to leave.

Cuba could provide Kissingerwith the coup
he needs to re-group his forces. but instead the
Secretary has taken the low road to more
criticism. America‘s silence at the November
meeting of the Organization of Americiin
States last year resulted in a continuation of

Great To Be Gay

by Ira Philip Shabronsky

My name islra. I‘ve passed you many times
in hallways, iii the dinirtg hall. at the
bookstore. anottytttotisly. I‘ve spoken with
you. been in yourclasses. and perhaps smoked
with yott. I look like ttny“riormal" human
behtg. Basically. I am nodifferentthanany of
yoti. llttt there is one small difference.l am
homosexual. This in itself means that lam an
outlaw because. itt case you weren‘t aware.
there is a Iatv on the books against this sort of
thing. Yet it's Ittnny. btit I don‘t feel like a
lawhrenker. I feel proud to finally be myself,
after sup rcssirtg my homosexuality for over 8
years.

It \vasa difficult period [or rnewhen I finally
"camcout." hiit I‘m glad Idid. "Coming out.“
Ill my mind. ntctttts ad milling to yourself your
sexual preference arid living your life as u
Itottiosexual. When I came out.just less than
one year ago. almost nobody knew about it.
lltis was because: I) I was afraid of the
reactions l would get from my straight friends.
and Z) l wanted my new friends (especially my
stittemutes. witlt whom I'd ttcvcr lived before)
to get to know tticusn person belot‘c gettiltglti
krtow me as a guy person. liven tip until this
settlcslct'. sortie people did not know ltvas guy.
little by little. I became more confident iii
myself. and now all my friends know. Nothing
has really changed. We all still feel the salite
toward caclt other. except that llccl cvert more
love and respect toward them for their
acceptance of a “new me.“ a person quite
differcrtt than when I came here some 2%
years ago. Arid I suppose that this is the case
for many gay people.

lliere are muny like ttie. lti lttct. latest
reports indicate that somewhere around l0%
of the population is homosexual. K inscy states
that. by the time they are lit. 37‘lbof the males
in the llrtited States will have had a
homosexual experience. There have been
many historical ligures about whom
speculation has been tttatlc of their sexual
preference. According to Nocl l. (iardc‘s book
Jorutrlimr IU (fit/v: ’I'lru llUIlltl.\'t'.\'lltll rrt
//l.\ttil'i'. some of these people were:
Acschylits. Socrates. Alexander the Great.
Julius Caesar, Sappho. Leonardo da Vinci.
Mtcliaelartgelo,Sltakcspearc,Molicre. George
Washington. Ileethoven,“Wild Bill“ Hickok.

lchaikowsky, Oscar Wilde. and a host of

others. So I‘m in good company. I suppose.

In the present society. gay people are not
readily accepted as human beings. We are
jcered at. abused. hurt. and persecuted. But

because of an incidetit involving gays rind
police in a raid of ti gay bar in Greenwich
Village. the Stonewall. in .ltittc I969. the guys
of New York saw that something Iiitd in be
done to organize themselves to light for their
rights and the rights of all other minorities.
Thus was the Cary Activist Alliance forntcd.
This group was the basis for the many (itiy
Alliance groups formed all over the cottntry.

SU NYA‘s own (irty Alliance group first met
iii the Fall of I970. The group ltas evolved
until. at this time. we are one of the more
active guy groups on college campuses iri New
York State. We have sponsored dances.
weekends. trips. and other successful events.
titty Alliance i. I socialgtoitp.whetc we have
informal discussions on many subjects»
itieism. prejudice. women‘s liberation. men‘s
liberation to make its all aware ofthe world
itt which we live. We Itnve had sensitivity
sessions to become tnore understanding of
ousclves and thus toward each other. This is
ttec sorry it we are to work as a unit. We are a
political group. willing to Itclp other
minorities. as well as ourselves. gain dignity

projects for the benefit of the university
community. In these ways. we are able to get
to know ourselves and to educate the public to
what (iay Alliance is and does. that we are not
just a bunch of "freaks" who have affairs with
people of their same sex.

Love is a complex thing. and we are
prevented frornloving each other. Because of
the present consentual sodomy law. two aditlts
can be arrested for any sex act other than
"missionary“-style coitus. Oral and anal sex
are forbidden. This affects heterosexuals as
well as homosexuals. According to a recent
newspaper article. a married r \uple is now in
jail for at least 5 years for Itavntg oral sex. It
seems that their child saw them by accident.

next-door neighbors. who called the police.
The police arrived and asked the couple to sign

usually doesn‘t get prosecuted. This time.

bedroom. This incident shows that “Big
Brother“ is watching. btit few people are aware
of this law and its effects. It affectsall. but gays
are singled out as the law‘s primary offenders.
Luckily. there is action being taken to repeal
this law. Unluckily. it is taking too long.
There a re a great many myths that seem to

to disspell once and for all.' ,_

The list goes on and on. All these myths are

when we were built. The people fitting these
stereotypes are "homosexual". and one must
be careful ofthes people. because they might
attack us in the night. or molest our children.
or other such sick things. But then. the Irish
are drunks. Poles are stupid. Italians are
greasy. Blacks steal. .Icws pinch pennies, and
women have inferior mental
capabilities . . . . don't they?

Why am I telling you all this'.’ Because on
Friday, May 9. I975. the SUNYA Gay
Alliance is sponsoring “It‘s Great to be Gay
Day“. a day-long group of events. Tentativcly
slated for this dayare: A display in the library.
an all-day table iii Campus Center with
literature and information about gay life-style,
:1 Lesbian poetess. Janet Cooper. who willgive
a poetry reading and lecture. a workshop on
the legal aspects of homosexuality. ti pane]
diseussion and question-answer period by
some of the members of the Albany gay
community and in the evening. a dance. A
schedule offintilized events willbe published
at a later date.

These events are geared to the general
public—this means YOU—because we know
who we are, and we want you to become more
familiar with us and with what Gay Alliance
does in the community. All are extended a
warm Welcome to join us on this day. Help
make “It‘s Great to be Gay Day" a really great
day. You have nothing to lose but your
stereotypes.
