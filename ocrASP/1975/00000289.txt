'_ Don't Barr the Students

The SUNYA faculty will be taking their annual vote Wednesday as to whether or not
students will partieipatelin the University Senate. Although student representation on
policy and advisory bodies has been institutionalized in some areas. there is a
possibility that the faculty may throw students off the Senate.

Admittedly student attendance at Senate meetings this year has been poor. but it is
no different from the faculty attendence record. Some students are accused of being
destructive or unduly involved with parliamentary procedure. but no one in the
University Senate is exempt from these accusations.

' The basis for student removal does not involve any difﬁculties with their day-to-day
Involvement in Senate affairs. but is philopphical in nature. Student presence on the
Senate is objected to by some in principle. Some faculty members believe that students
have no business on a university governing body. There are faculty members at this
school who are capable of presenting eloquent speeches defendingthat point of view.

But whatever their arguments. the entire university would suffer without students on
the Senate. Students come and go through college and thus have no positions to
protect and few ﬁnancial ties with the school. Their prespective, obviously biased in
other ways. increases the objectivity ofthe Senate. Students have made it clear in recent
years. and universities have generally agreed that their participation in running the
institution is essential to its health. responsiveness and growth.

Teaching is the cornerstone ofa university‘s existence; with research alone it is no
different than acorporation'slaboratory. Teaching is for students. but more than that.
teaching provides the structure for an exchange of ideas that are contributing to the
society as a whole. Student opinion is invaluable in judging faculty because they alone
can constantly evaluate semester after semester whether or not a professor is
t'llllllllllllit'alfllg. Student opinion in deciding policy is essential when it concerns them.
as it always does.

We are all well past the days when student's weredenied a say in their own education.
Universities can better serve all their purposes when students are helping to govern
them. it is essential that faculty members realize the value of students on the Senate and
that they come to the meeting tomorrow and vote to keep students on the Senate.

A New Beginning

SUNYA's student body showed once again last week that they are among the most
politically aware in the country. More than a third of those eligible to vote in the SA
elections did so. a percentage that compares favorably with other schools.

By voting to fund NYPIRG by a five-to-one margin the position of students on the
importance of citizen awareness was made clear. Students here have decided that they
want their own watchdog over the workings of government and business,
understanding that the existing checks and balances are simply not enough.

Mandatory student tax passed by a margin approaching that of the NYPIRG
referendum. Though there was little publicity about the issue. the vote was
overwhelming enough to show the students‘ position was quite definite. ideally,
mandatory tax would be unnecessary. but years of experience have shown that social
and recreational programs are most successful when there is a mandatory tax.

The vote totals of both SA President-elect Andy Bauman and Vice President-elect
Rick Mcckler were sufficient to make student opinion on the candidates clear. Ken
Wax‘s withdrawal from the presidential run-off race was indeed “decent.” as Bauman
put it. A run-off vote would have been a waste at best; the student‘s preference was
clear.

. There is always a hope ofa vibrant SA at this time ofyear. and with the support of an
inVolVed student body the Batiman-Meckier administration could avoid the mistakes
and go beyond the successes of previous SA administrations.

Humanizing the Presidency

Gerald Ford has appeared so frequently on
television and in print and interviews recently
that it appears to sotne as ifhe is trying to sell
his policies on personality alone. like tin
athlete selling razor blades or shaving cream.
Cynicism aside. though. Gerald Ford tnny
very well be doing the institution of the
Presidency, trttd the country itself. an
invaluable service. Witcther his tcnrirc lusts six
years or only two he should be rcrnctnbcrcd its
the man who rc-humanizcd the Presidency. if
for no other reirson tlnin becairsc he is so
thoroughly human. lie plnys golf. tennis. goes
swimming and exercises every morning. The
most athletic thing Richard Nixon ever did
was to wait-Ii a football game. Ford is very
loose and opcrt. whereas Richard Nixon came
across as an ice-cube cotnplctely tititiblc to
unwind ttllti he himself.

in the waning days of the Nixon rcgitnc
Nixon‘s men continually reiterated the line
that the President was the Presidency.
Obviously this isn‘t true. Richard Nixon is no
longer tiround nnd the institution of the
Presidency continues to exist. Oddly enough
though. they didn‘t miss the mark by much.
the President tttny not be the Presidency. but
to sortie extent the Presidency is the tuition.
When the President goes abroad he is the
United States. representing all 2|0 rrtillion
people. If the President makes it diplomatic
lilrtndcr it is itot only it personal
embarrassment. bitt it cotild be it mistake
which 4 inevitably injures relations
internationally.

lo if certain extent. tlierclorc. the
personality of the President affects niid

Nixon resigned iriid the truth of Watergate

CA‘xing Peace

To the Editor:

On Wednesday night..Aprii 30. Central
Council. due to the urging of Lew Fidlcr and
another council member cut the Peace Project
budget from $425 to absolutely nothing. The
reason for their decision is incomprehensible

' to me. Lew Fidier said. in cffcct. that lie can‘t

see why Central Council should give ntottcy to
a group so that they can htind out their
propaganda. He also said that he can‘t see how
5425 would bring peace in the world. The
other reason given for our not deserving
funding came its a response to Mike Sakoff‘s
remark thntcutting Peace Project will do great
wonders for student apathy. The response

is no room for Scuba Club on the budget)and .
can‘t give a group like Peace Project 3425
which is a 8225 cut from last year. lwould like

to thank lra Bimbaum and Mike Sakoff for
their Vocal support at the meeting.

Finally. i feel that this problem of priorities
is not just a problem of Peace Project. but irlso
of many othcrcumpus groups who try to make
this university a place for critical analysis of
thought. values. and practices instead of just
an institution of unrellective cultural
perpetuation. For cxample. Fucrza Latintt
proposed a budget of $3|.950 which was crtt
by Budget Comruittec to $l8.50(l. Centrtrl
Council then ctit the new bridget to the
inadequate level of $8500. This letter should
not be taken as resttlting from any personal
enmity on my part bttt more to point out that
our cducatiomtl system should not be
considch apn rt frotrt the rest of our society -—
somctliingwhich botlt our student leadersnnd
national leaders can't quite understand.

.loseph Kraut
Peace Project Treasurer

from a Council member whose name ldo not \

know was that Peace Project wnsn grortptltat
did indeed induce apathy. All tltcy do is dress
up. paint tiicirl‘aces. sit iii tigcrcngcs. and look
iisapittheticns possible. This member also said
that the Vietnam War is over and tltcrc is now
pcacc iii the world. it seems flint this member
has no idea about what is going on outside of
SUNY at Albany. Also. to think that sitting in
a tiger cage was done to indttcc apathy showsn
total inability of this tncmbcr to understand it
group of people‘s desire to communicate an
idea.

’10 Lew l'idlcr's accusation tltnt all l’cncc
Project does is f'omcnt propaganda. i would
like to elucidate for hint and others our
purpose. As far as ottr propngnttiln. we get
much of oitr information from the State
Department and non-political groups. When
we show films trbout the nuclear ciicrgy
controversy. and when we hand out literature
about where ottr tax ritoncy goes. amnesty.
and political prisoners. we are try ing to bring
an awareness to the student hodon real issues
that affect real people. We are not trying to
rccrtiit people to ndvaitcc a particular political
potttt of view. What we are trying to do is
stimulate interest itt nrtd iiicrctrscawareness of
how it for of the world's major problems are
mtcrrclatcd. and necessarily rcinrcd to our
political structure and cultural practices. We
do this iti order that we. as “responsible
citi/cns“ can indeed tict responsibly when
lacing our contemporary problems. At every
event we have sponsored. we have encouraged
lrec discussion of ideas. Pcticc Projcct as a
group does not have a specific political point
til view. We. as individuals. arc constantly
reflecting on and changing ottr own values.
When we work with other campus groups tic.

Holding the Line

in the Editor:

I thought it wottld bc ofintcrcst to notify the
student hotly that they will be seeing less
conccrts and speakers next year. The Concert
lionrd brtdgct has arbitrarily been cut S9000
illlti Speakers l‘ttl‘lllll will have $7900 less to
spulld titctt it did this year.

(inc wonders where SA President Pitt
t'urinn decides to hold the line on the budget
iltltl wliy he decides to institute increases or
cuts, ()nc also wonders witctltcr Mr. Curran
isn't being bittidcd by his association with
l'lRti. flow can Mr. Curran justify it $10000
bridch tor PlRti an increase of $8774. Only
ltnll of the 532.000 PlRti btrdgct is coming
from the referendum. 'lhc rest is front your
nctnity lcc. Ihis makes tltc total increase for
PlRti 3624.774.

One has to laugh whctt in one breath Mr.
Curran snys mass programming is his top
priority bitt at the same time limits the budgets
of two of the few groups who provide any
services or programs the students enjoy. Lets
hope tltnt before Central Council approves the
final budget. it adds money to the programs
students want to see.

To the Editor: . : r -

Student Association's sponsored late night
weekend has is finally here. It took months of
effort by Central Council members from
Alumni Quad and Central Council‘s
Committee of Of‘l'Campus Student Life to get
the buses rolling.

This new late night weekend service will run
on Fridays and Saturdays until May l7. The
bus will follow the normal SUNYA Shuttle
route arid will go dowrt Washington Ave. to
Lark St. and tltcn follow a circuit up Madison
nround Washington Park irnd back to the
regular SUN YA route on Western Ave.
Contrary to what the ASP article on May 2
said. this bus will stop anywhere along the
rotitc. The last bus leaves the circle at 3:30.
Starting this week. the bus will leave the circle
every half-hour starting ill I :00 am. and from
l’rirtridgc- Westernon the quarter hour.

Unless students are willing to give some
time working with SA. neither this badly
wanted service our the planned bits to Colonic
will be around next sctttcs '. l)on‘t forget
niiyoite without their tax cttt‘d arid Ll). will be

Counting the Votes

To the Editor:

I‘m writing in answer to M r. Kiiil‘s letter of
Mary 2. which critici/cd the way the SA
elections were being rriii. He cited State Quad
as an instance where he scented to find
incompetence and inaccuuicy. Mr. Kail.
you‘ve got it lot to learn.

All in all. ti total of45‘) working hours were
put in by a special election staff (not to
mention the extra strain pill on the regular SA
staff). A total of 22.000 ballots had to be run-
off. some 500-800 sorted r'iii'ii Iiiglil til I/lt‘
t'lt't‘lft‘ll. and some 2200 iiiiiiiii't/ Ill'ft’t' on

the temporary ballot shortage. to stubborn

candidates who, refused to follow

electioneering rules. Most of the'worlrers were ,'

new to the SA process. still learning what goes
where. and they did an outstanding job
handling countless problems. . _

The paper ballots Mr. *Kail complained
about are dictated by the election bill passed
by Council. therefore it is a mystery to me why
he hassled pollsitters about it. Races for some
twenty elective offices had to be run in four
days. a monumental task fora staffofany size.

A very successful and well run election was the '

result. More students voted in this election
than in most previous elections. and in an age
of apathy that‘s quite an accomplishment.

In closing. l‘d just like to say’that lam sick
and tired of people who hassle SA when they
have no idea of what goes on. if people like
Mr. Knil want to really getdown to findingout
how hard it is to run things around here (since
front his letterit is obvious that he has no idea
of the problems we encounter) I suggest they
get themselves a job at SA and find out first
hand. If Mr. Kailthinks that the elections were
rttn incornpctently. maybe he'cnn do a better
job. if so. I invite him to come down and get
himself on SA position. Perhaps he'd like to
start with mine.
