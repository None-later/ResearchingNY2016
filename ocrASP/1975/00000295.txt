nhtt‘vv‘w‘A.4z .__ . . . . ..

by Unda Fried

For two years there has been a
marked discrepancy between the
amount of available space in the dor-
mitories. and the numberofstudcnts
to fill it. The problem eas solved by
squeezing in additional beds. thus
forcing four students to live‘ in a
room only comfortable for two.
Next year holds no promise of
change.

.loltn Welty. the head of on-
cainpiis housing. said in regard to
tire issue. “At present.it‘s very dif-
ficult to make a specific statement."
Nonetheless. Ite did nteet on Friday.
May 2. withth StudentAssociation
and the Committee on Residence to
discuss what steps will be taken.
should overcrowding again be the
case.

According to Lew Fidler. Central
Council Chairman. at that meeting
\Vclty reported there will be one
hundred to three hundred more
students than there is roottt for. He
added to this that sonte hope lies iii
the increase in cancellations over
previous years.

Fidler also had a list of eleven
alternatives presented by Welty at
Friday‘s meeting. The ﬁrst was to
move tlte residence staff out.
resulting itt forty—five more spaces at
a cost of approximately $3,000.00.
In the straw poll that followed. this
alternative was wa only received. A
second proposal which rcecited a
very cold response. was the conver-
sioit of the tower penthouscs.
producing forty-two spaces it
around $7000.00. l‘cclings were also
very itegatiw at the suggestion of
adding aioont on each even ﬂoor of
the towers. sixty add itionalspaces at
a cost iii the neighborhood of$42.-
000.00.

.fifth on the list. would increase

availahe rooming capacity by sixty-
nine. but the cost in services would
approach $45,000.00. Welty‘s sixth
tentative idea was to convert foor
lounges on Indian Quad to sixty!
four living spaces at a minimal cost.
Students were strongly opposed to
this. The seventh. perhaps most ex-
pensive proposal, was that of con-
verti ng all four man suites on Dutch
and Colonial Quads to live man
suites. equal in size to thosepresent-
ly on State Quad. The I00 bedspaces
would probably cost over $150.-
000.00.
No Freshmen Tripled

Alternative number cigltt would
be tripling for those who requested
it. Freshmen. itot being fully aware
of the implications. would not be
tripled. and no one would be
quadrupled. The remaining three
suggestions were not heavily con-
sidered. The S A added a twelfth
proposal to Welty's list. that of
reeonvcrting the Lower floors of
Mohawk tower to donnitory rooms.
The ofﬁces currently oceupyingthat
space would he moved to the
lounges.

S A President I’at Curran. Vice-
I’rcsident Ira Birn haunt. and Fidler
ittitiatcd a discussion ahottt the Utt-
iversity‘s policy. Their contention
was that it is wrong to allow dorm
capacity to grow in the way that is is.
Fidler poiitted out."|'lte number

Will students be forced to llve In overcrowded room lllte the one above next year?

Tenant Unions Work for Students

(CPS) Water pipesabout to burst.
missing windows.ito hot water. no
refrigerator. no stove. What six Un-
iversity of Michigan stttdents found
when they moved ittto their new
house last fall ch tltcin to one deci-
sion: no ntorc rent.

Sis montlts later. after a stormy
eight-hour court session. their rent
strike was vindieatcdﬁl‘heir landlord
had not tnade promised repairs. the
judge ruled. so the students were not
liable for any rent. In fact. he said.
they were ctititlcd to a rebate on the
one month‘s rcittl they already paid.

Caught iii a housing squce/c.
many students across the country
Ilil\t.' begun to baiid together.
through reitt strikes and tenants utt-
ions. to figltl for tltc same rights
other consumers have had for years.

I'enants uitions have especially
found l'irm ground for growth iit
high concentration student areas like
Madison. WI; Ann Arbor MI: New
Brunswick NJ: Cambridge. M A;
Minneapolis MN; Eugene OR and
Columbus. OH. 'IIie rise ol these
groups over the past lite years has
pointed tip the unique problems of
student tenants and gitcn birtlt to a
number of strategies Ior evening tip
the sides iit ii landlord-tciuinl
slitgl‘cst.

In many large college towns. the
lirst housing problem students lace
is: no housing

for instance. the llnuetsity ol
\Viseoitsin-Madisoit ripped down it
urge antouiig ol housing without
replacing it. according to .loliii
Illoom ol the Madison l'cnants lln—
ion. At the same tinic.tlte llIIIlL‘I'SIIy

Itas increased its student population
and loosened requirements about
living oit campus -forcinga housing
shortage.

The result. iIt Madison arid otltcr

college towns. has been rapid
development without ntuclt
foresight,

“lintire neighborhoods have been
changed because of the glitt tilt the
market." said Bloom.'l.and|ords do
cosmetic remodeling on houses and
rent them to larger groups ol people.
In one central area a Ioning relaxa-
tion has all owed hotels oit ottc side ol
the street with high rises on the
other. and still huddled iit between
them all are so itic frame houses."

Ironically. commented Ilrian
Robbins of the National Housing
and Fconontic Development Law
l’rojcct. large scale remodeling ol
rtiit dow II areas near a urtiversity will
often piit rent otit of reach for the
students the housing was supposed
to scr\c.

with higher reitt. but also with

“I nitial reforms are no panacea for
tenants. they‘re just the foundation.“
said Robbins of the National Hous-
ing law Project. “U nitl more ad-
vanced reforms are passed. you're
still going to get iitto trouble with
time-consuming attd expensive
suits."

Student tenants who want to win
more rights. said Robbins. should
work for t Itc passage of the Uniform
Residential landlord attd ‘l'enaut
Act (USD'I'A). an ontnibuspiecc of
model legislation that. antongotlter
things. prohibits retaliaton evic-
iioits and guarantees tenants the
right to it habitable place to live.
