Un tenured Teac”

by Michael Sena

The books in Hans Bergman's of-
fice; leaves of Grass. the Norton
Anthology of American Literature
containing Melville. Hawthorne.
and Poe, selected works by Mark
Twain. and poetry by Daniel
Berrigan. will soon be gone. The
reserved. easy-going English
professor who wasdenied tenure last
year will be teaching at George
Mason University in Fairfax,
Virginia when school reopens.

Originally. Bergman was ap-

 

proved for tenure by the English
department by a vote of about47-5.
but was denied tenure at the next
level whichis a committee headed by
Ruth Schmidt. Dean of the
Humanities. According to Bergman
the reason he was denied tenure was
an insufficient number of
publications. While there were
avenues of appeal open to Bergman.
he did not want to fight— like Curt
Smith or Carolyn Waterman. “I
wasn‘t interested in going through
the Orrt Smith battle——- the Dean of

to medical services. in turn, the in-
ternational students reciprocate
through offering interpreting ser-
vices and participating in the
Speakers‘ Bureau. a service to com-
munity agencies which provides the
community with foreign students to
address variotrs groups. etc.

Exactly who are the intemational
students? in all probability, the
avcrachUNYA student knows little
about them. Contrary to popular
belief. only 25% (45 of 200) live in
Saylcs international House. 80% of
the internationals an: graduatc
students; 20% undergrads.

Dr. Paul J. Ward. lntemational
Students Advisor combines his cf-
forts and talents with thoscofthc ln-
ternational Center's Mrs.Smith. Dr.
Ward is responsible for the personal
welfare and problcnrs of each stu-
dent in addition to working with the
Center and its orientation and ho mc
hospitality programs. He and the In-
ternational Student office give the
students broader contact with the

United Statesthrough lieldtrips.etc.

Many innovations have stemmed
from the international Student of-
ficc. The International Students
Association. (funded by SA) was
found in 1964 to join American and
foreign culturesas a vehicle forallto
learn more. They still hold cultural
trips and provide Amerierms taking
part in International Program with
more informaiton. l.S.A. includes
both off-campus rind Suylcs people
in its activities. Since itsfounding. its
contact with the SUNYA communi-
ty has lcssencd.

Probably the greatest achieve-
ment of the International Students
Office was the founding of an inter-
national dorm. Ruth Spruck. dorm
director of Saylcs. fought for the
dorm until its opening in I972. She
feels that it is a necessity for inter-
national students. Sayles. for both
Americans and foreign students. is a
day-to-day interchange of cultures
and warmth as well as an opportuni-
ty to establish friendships which
foreign students Would not have

 

er Takes,

Hurmnities had a good case aminst
me.” said Bergman. ‘That kind of
battle would take another yearout of
my life and therear'e’rnore important
things to worry about. Now I'm not
sorry about leaving% we (his wife
and himl’wo‘uld prob ’ny have hft in
any case because she; s finishing her
Ph.D— well that‘s an easy
rationalization." '

From the outset-' Bergman had
been docile and accepting about his
tenure denial. "I might iavcdonethc

otherwise. and which the average
SUNYA student isoften too hesitant
or 'too busy“ to offer.

Sayles holds many activities which
Ruth Spruck claims are not suf-
ficiently publicized. Although
isolated because of geographic loca-
tion on Alumni Qrad. the three-
year-old international house is a
great move for the identity and
problems of the foreigners. The inr-
agc is now fomrcd but it does not
have cnougit impact upon the
SUNYA community and uptown
life. Dr. Ward feels that if an entire
dorm uptown were set aside as an
“International House." awareness
would increase from cndously.

.larms E. Briggs. Director ofthc

Office of international Visitor
Programs in Washington says. “Wc
cart all learn to appreciatcborh corri-
rnon valucs and differing pcrspcc-
lives. The result is a growing
worldwide community of
knowlcdgablc leaders. sensitive to
the realities of intcrdcpcndcncc...a
contribution to world peace."

the evidenceiwhe laid. -a may be '

through great effort but ldon’t feel
any great bitterness— that‘s not to
say I was happy about it. it's over a
year ag'o. I'm thinking about how
nice it will be to live in Washington.
1'“ miss a lot of students.“

‘lt‘s' very important for the

English Department to encourage'

quality publication. The department
is not a strong publishing depart-
ment." he said. “Somewhere in me I
believe that professors should be
teachers and schoh rs.“ ’

“While Bergman doesn‘t have the
quantity of publications. he has the
quality.“ said Nancy Miller. a former
student. “He discovered theoriginai
source for Melville‘sTheConﬂdence
Man and spoke before the
prestigious Melville Society." she
added. He has been a popular
professor with students.

While Bergman has never wanted
to create waves. he was critical ofthc
English [l-partmcnt for not asser-
ting itself. "The department would
have more power ifthcy felt they had
more power." Concerning tenure
and term renewals(thcgrantingofa

.ncw contract to professors when

their old one expires) he said that if
the English dcpartrrrcrrt would make
a decision. vrith good reasonsbchind
it to back them up. and argue for it.
they would havc rnorc say in tenure
and tcrm renewal decisions. “in the
past they have made decisions
without enough thought.“

“There has been a power vacuum
in the English Department that
Dean Schmidt has filled.“ said
Bergman. “Schmidt shouldn‘t have
the power over the department that
she docs brrt given the conditions she

has been unwilling to melt"

decisions concerning tenure.

term renewals." ‘ ,
Bergmn explained that there

'have been some decisions'that»_

Schmidt has trade that he‘hel liked

' less than his own. Though he didn't

want to‘elaborate he offered English
professor Jerry Paris as an example.
Dean Schmidt did not renew Paris‘
contract. “There‘s much to be ad-
mired in Jerry Paris.“ Bergman aid.

' “Schmidt thinks blindly about term

renewals tint have resulted in several
bad decisiom."

When asked if the English Depart-
ment has been intimidated by out-
side ad ministrators such as Schmidt.
Bergnstn said. “Yes. the question is.
is there good reason? The reason I
was hesitant about an interviewis
that i didn‘t want to sound like I'm
running down the department.
Basically I think it‘s a good depart-
ment. I'm a little leery about what
this story is going to look like-— but
what do i care.“ Bergman said as he'
smiled.

As the semester nears its conclu-
sion. Bergman is looking ahead to
teaching at George Mason. “I‘m
thinking so much forward now. in-
stead of backward. l‘m excited and
happy about going to this new place
with its active. involved. exciting
pcoplc. I‘ll miss particularpeoplr: 
students even though some of
thcrn are gone already. I‘ll miss the
department. But i won't miss the
school hccausc l havelitticscnseofit
as a place. I hope I’ve made an irr-
tcllcctual difference to students
there's solittlc I can do to make the m
all better people."
