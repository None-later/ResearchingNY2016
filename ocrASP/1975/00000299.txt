canine cousins, 

There's the old saying. “Old
soldiers never die, they just fade
away". .

Well, apparently old members of
Congress don‘t even fade away—at
least not from Washington. A survey
by the New York. Tine: of the 103
Congress poeple who were defeated
in last year‘s elections has found
about half of them still work in
Washington.

The survey found that many of
them are lobbyists who are hired by
private interests to act as public
relations go-betweens on Capitol
Hill; others are attomeys; and still
others have used their congressional
contacts to open up successful
private businesses in the nation‘s
capitol.

KILLER BEES

Scientists at the University of
California have designed a computer
program in an effort to track so-
called “killer bees“ moving'
northward through South America
toward the United-States.

The potentially deadly st 'arms be-
ing monitored are known as “hybrid
al‘ricaniLed bees."

Berkeley - entomologist Doctor
Howell Daly says that the bees first
became a problem after they were
imported to Brazil in l95(v.'l'he bees,
known for their ferocity and
aggressiveness. escaped from their
insect compounds and have since
literally taken over Brazil. Today,
there are no traditional European
honey bees left in Brazil.

The africanized bees are reported
to have attacked people and
livestock. A recent report from a
small town north of Sao Paolog,
Brazil. states that a swarm of the

.fcrocious insects attacked lithe

village, hospitalizing I7 people.
There are a number of accounts

- that ihc insects have fatally stung

their victins. The New York Times
recently referred to them‘as “man
killersJ'

,The latest report. according to
Doctor Daly. is that the bees are
moving northward at the mic of200
miles per year. He says they are
reported to have crossed the

Amazon River and to have entered ’

French Guiana.

Doctor Daly says that telling an
african bee from a norrnalhoney bee
by sight is virtually impossible. As a
result. university scientists have
perfected a computer program that
can be used to identify the bees and
keep track of their progress.

ISSUE BLUES

liob Dylan says that one reason
he‘s not writing as many songs these
days is that the 1970‘s are “too con-
fusing.“

liob. who was interviewed on the
Mary Travers radio show. says that
the issues were much clearer in the
l960‘s, and it was easier for him to
turn out message songs.

Dylan'says of the l970‘s:“lt‘s hard
to find a frontier.“ He says that it‘s
almost impossible now to “make
stini'kind of art from out of these
big'situations tha are happening in
the world, From say to day. they're
just rolling oveiijtoo fast...”

POWER PARKS

Now that opposition to nuclear
power plants is mounting, the power
industryis promoting the concept of

. building huge new “power parks."

In Pennsylvania. utility com-
panies there are suggesting that
locations of up to-40,000 acres
should be set aside to house live to
ten nuclear plants and five to ten
coal-fired plants-«all in the same
location.

The utilities have announced [0
possible sites for these power parks.
saying that it might be better to put
20 plants together rather tlta a scatter
them singly through the state.

In the state ofNew York.(icncral
Electric vice president Arthur
Iiuechc has suggcstcd that power
parks could he built on the St.
Laurence River. Iiuechc says that
plants would then discharge tlicir
hot waste water directly in the 5'
Lawrence and pre vent the river from
frec/ing in the wintertimc.
