There is a temporary postpon-
ment ofthe remainderofthe Braun-
Green match due to a large pile of
unfinished work on my desk. With
finals coming up shortly. it will he
very difﬁcult to get any chess playing
in. The following game is our fourth
and latest effort. It is a symmetrical
English opening with neither side
putting out any rcalenergy to win.
However, I do have some im-

‘ provemcnts for white which will be

played in our sixth match game.

Opening Lead: 10 Hearts

When this hand came up our
South declarer studied dummy and
reﬂected on West‘s opening ll) of

went the Ace. and the first hurdle
was overcome successfully.

South‘s next thought \\as‘ to enter
his hand with the spade Ace to
attempt the diamond finesse. And
again. he correctly concluded that
this play could never be correct.
Analy/ing this ltIther. it means that
ii Fast has the King of diamonds.
then why fincssc'.’ If West has the
King more than once guarded. the
lincsse will indeed succeed. but
diamonds can no longer be set tip. t It
is important to realiIe that without
five diamond tricks the hand can not
be made; it is only when we get
greedy and try for the ovcrtricks t hat
our game is' sacril'iced- never a sound
policy in rubber bridge.) The right
play at triek twu. as South sth it. is
to play the Ace and another dia-
mond. letting East win his King.

Fast's best (if he has one) return
is a club. which is linessed.and won
by West. West‘s club return is won
by South. Nowthe fun starts; on the
last diamond ﬁrst must make a
crucial discard from this holding:

A spade discard gives South a couple
of free spade tricks, The heart King.
it discarded, gives up a trick im-
mediately. And a club discard per-
mits South to plin another heart; but
now. East has no way of ruiching his
partner for those club winners.

So by playing safe from the begin-
ning South not only brought in his
nine tricks. but thsilbiClOﬂCgtillﬂlc
the overtrick.
