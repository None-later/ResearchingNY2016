She's 5’5", friendly. outgoing. and
personable. and what's more, she‘s
one ofthe 10 in the world. Who'lJo
Anne Haterkorn. co-eaptaiii of the
Albany State Varsity Cheerleaders.

“We are not out there for the hell
of it", said Haferkorn. Cheerleading
requires a lot of time in practice.and
in resolving problems which come
up. such as transportation to certain
events. encouraging involvement of
the students regarding athletics as
spectators. developing new routines,

s

and resolving personal conﬂicts
within the group. Our squad had no
coach to guide or help us this year;
next year. Doctor Edith Cobanc will
be our official coach ."

“l was not a cheerleader in high
school". said Haferkom.‘biit when I
came here. i did not want to get lost
in the crowd. This is a big school.
and for me, checrleading was my
way of getting involved."

“Not many people have a sense of
school spirit here. but some people
do care. and those aretlie people we

 

are out there to lead and entertain.
We are also active in other ways. as
we attempt to promote interest in
Albany State sports.“

There are l0 varsity cheerleaders
at SUNYA. the survivors of tryout
test following 4 practice sessions.
The tryout includes: an individual
cheer; approach technique: three
jumps; and a group cheer taught in
the practice sessions.

“We should have at least l5
cheerleaders on the varsity. and an
equal number on thej .v. at a school
this size“. said Ilaferkoni. “but with
the poor funding we have for
ttthletics...what can you expect?“

When asked about guys as
cheerleaders. Hafcrkom answered.
“I think its a great idea. and you see
them at lots of large and small
schools across the nation. It would
make things even more fun.and add
an extra degree of socialiling that is
often missing.“

Her only regret: “I only wish l
could be out there again next year.
especially with the coming of a
coach. but my courses are too
demanding. I am a iiictlical
technology major.and I just won't
have the ti me.“
