Cold on The Shoulder—Gordon
Lightfoot ‘

The only predictable thing about
Gordon Lightfoot is his un-
predicatability. He has proven this
repeatedly, releasing albums of
radically different quality again and
again. With his newest release,CoId
on the Shoulder.Lighfoot has
proven this theory once more. Ad-
mittedly, it would be very hard to
follow such a beautiful, artistically
balanced album as Sundown. and it
really is unfair to compare, but com-
parisons are unavoidable. The most
obvious difference is evcness of
material and production. Cold on
the Shoulder suffers from a lack of
the rich full sound that Sum/mm
possessed. The most obvious
difference is eveness of material and
production ofthe rich fullsourrd that
Sundown posscscd. The material
chosen is good individually, but put
together on the album the songs for
the most part don‘t flow, and they
weaken each other through their in-
consistency.

The quality of the songs
themselves ﬂuctuates, from the ex-
cellent title song to the trite “Now
and Then", such lines as "We were
only playing like two children who
had strryed away from school/{Two of
us could not he wrong/I'lcuvcn
knows who keeps the golden
rtrlc..."'l'he ﬁrst single from the
album is “Rainy Day I’coplc“,n nice
song, but just that. Whether it is
lacking in melody, lyric' r in both.
it comes under the chi rfication of
“Background Music“ in the pc-
jomtivc sense. The rt lbum‘s other low
point is one of the songs he does on
the piano, “Fine as Fine Can lie", a
song written for his daughter, which
is perhaps the only saving grace it
has. It suffers from an uneven
balance between the melody and the
lyrics, as does the other piano piece,
“Bells of the Evening.“This last song
is better, though, bemuse most of the
lyrics are beautiful.“l'm caught by
the rninstrel's misfortune/of being
forever displaced..."

Taken individually. most of the
songs are strong and of good and
even excellent quality. “The Soul Is
the Rock", “Cherokee licud“,
"A'I‘ree Too Weak to Stand". urtd
“Bend in the Water“ are among
those. The one factor, then, in lltc
failure of the album to stand Its a
balanced whole is the production.
Nick DcCaro‘s. over-orchestmtion is
at fault here, its well its Lenny
Waronkcr‘s production. He did too

.little with the song “Cold on the

Shoulder", leaving us with a thin
skeleton of a track (are the echoes
deliberate, and what do they rncttn'll.
and he did too much with “’Iltc Soul
Is the Rock", almost swallowing the
sound of the expert acoustic guitar
work in the spine ofthe song, over-
Powrrring Lightfoot‘s voice when: it
should stand alone and overpower
us. Wuronker also ruined any
chances “Now and Then" had as a
ﬂood song. by playing up its pop-
MOR faullyaspccts and not paying
enough attention to its folk-

Lightfoot roots, which would have
madethe songinto something entire-
ly more listenable than the prime
candidate for Muzak that it isnow.

The production, however, isn’t
totally bad. Lightfoot's voice hasn‘t
sounded this smooth and ﬂowing
since “Summer Sideof Life“,oreven
“If You Could Read My Mind." And
where the guitar work is able to be
heard, it is cxcellent,although that is
not so much due to the producer as
to the perfonners.Lightfoot's back-
up team of Red Shea and Terry
Clements on lead guitar and Rick
Haynes and John Stockfish on bass
have been consistently excellent
through the years. And Lightfoot
himself. of course, plays a beautiful
rhythm guitar, and handles theoand
I2-strings with an case that just
seems next to breathing for him.

Taking into consideration the
ruggedness ofthe production, “Cold
on the Shoulder“ can still stand as
an important step in the growth of
Lightfoot as an artist. The self-
uwurencss and sligltt edge of
bitterness of “'A Tree Too Weak To
Stand" is a far cry, and a better
onc.from thc sugary "Beautiful."
And considering Lightfool‘s
remarkable ability to prodrrce
albums of the highest quality after
ones that are not so good, the next
one should be a gem.

Newcomer
Nancy Nevins

by Betty Stein

Nancy Nevins—~-Nancy Nevins
(RCA)

Once in a great while there sur-
faces a rare, take-notice talent that
combines a sort of funky, free-
spiritcd sound with all ofthe control.
subtlety. and timingthat comes from
being born with that musical sixth
sense most of us can only wish we
had. Unfortunately, Nancy Nevins
is not one of those people. At times
site comes close, but close is a long
way from being there. Her first
solo effort, appropriately cntitlcd
Nam-y Nevins. makes it painfully ob-
vious that it is just that—her first
one. The fact that she wrote the
music and lyrics for all brrt one cut is
laudable. The lyrics are sometimes
fun. sometimes sensitive, if straight-
forward. And the music provides a
buckrlrop that is tI(lL‘t|l.lIllC* nothing
more. nothing less. But her perfor-
mnncc of that material often lacks
the control one comes locxpcct from
u seasoned performer.

This is where the funk and free
spirit come in. Nevins has plenty of
both, but to the point ofcxccss. In an
apparent effort to project no image
that is out~going, uninhibited rind
ol'f-thc-wnll. she takes things a little
too for and ends up coming offrnore
like u neophytic recording artist try-
ing to piece together an image.

In “liaroqucn Heart," for in-
stance, the subler of her interpreta-
tion is matched only by the sledge-
hammcr subtlety of the lyrics:

When your world/kills tt/mr!

xlml you have it fltll'tltlltt'll hear!

Just gel .rlunt'tl. just get high

.lrIsI gt'l .l‘ltIIIl’tf Io [mar fl by.

Of course, every song need not be

soul-scorching masterpiece. but
combine the above lyrics with u
scratchy vocal rendition that is laced
with various shouts and growls and
you get an end product that is more
annoying than entertaining.

This is not to say that Nevins has
no rcdccming qunlitics. On such
tunes as “We Could Always Say it
wars Rrrinin' Outside" and "Just Like
a little Iioy" she manages to slow
down long enough to expose us to II
huskily expressive voice that can put
across the meaning ofn song witlrotrl
resorting to forced extremes.

It is, in fact. this rough and husky
voice. partially the result of a near-
fntnl trccidcnt six ycn rs ago which left
her with one vocul chord paralyzed
and the other nickcd.tlurt could crisi-
ly become her vehicle to being that
run.- find she does not quite fit the
description of. For it is not it luck of
talent she suffers from, but rather ll
luck of musical maturity with which
to use it.

This album represents one of
several recently released on a new
label which featuresotherjazzartists
such as Count Basic and guitarist
Joe Pass. This album does not con-
tain any new pieces, and only three
of the seven songs were written by
Dizzy. Along with Gillespie. the
album features Joe Pass, Ray BrOWn
on bass, and Mickey Roker on
drums.

Dizzy gained fame and recogni-
tion during the early and mid I940‘s
playing with The Earl Hines Band,
and later with Charlie Bird and his
own bands. It wasduring these years

Discotheque—Herbie Mann (Atlan-
tic)

Whrrt happens when you trike
good songs and give them to great
musicians? They become great
songs. and that‘s just what occurs on
this album.

Side one is filled with good nrusic
to hustle rind bump by. The first song
is Herbie Mann‘s contribution to
commercial radio. his current hit
“Iii—Jack“. In case you haven‘t heard
it. it‘s n funky tune which Herbie
Mann mcllows out with his little. It
sets the mood of the album.

“Hi—Jack“ is followed by some
shoot-cm up funk. the popular
AWIi‘s “Pick Up the Pieces“. Except
this time, the musicianship that‘s
lacking in the original is more than
mrtdc up for. Herbie rind his corn-
pn by of fine musicians in kc this song
to places its never been before. It‘s
filled with great pcrcussionand some
Iltrwlcss solo work by Mr. Mann‘s
flute. There's even some good syn-
thesizer work on it by Pat Rebillot.
But what's better is that you can
dance to it as easily as the or iginal. It
gives me comfort to hear dance
music played like this.

Side one continues strongly with

It was in this “Bop Era that the.
piece “Be Bop (Diz'zy's Fingers)"svas

‘ ‘ written. The song has become ‘syn- '

onomous with that era and its
author, Dizzy Gillespie. It is a true
tribute to Joe Pass‘ guitar playing
that he is able to keep up with the
demonic pace set in the song.

In contrast to the pyrotechnics of
“Be Bop“, Gillespie and Company
have taken Irving Berlin‘s “Russian
Lullaby", torisinally
written in I923 ‘.. to a % waltzl,
tempo, changed it to a standarddl4

tempo, and speeded it up to a pace ' i

comparable to “Be Bop”. It is these
two songs that prove to be the
highlights of the album due to the
sheer virtuosity with which they are
performed. ,

The rhythm section of Brown and
Rokcr proves to be ofdurable quali-
ty. keeping a solid backing behind
Dizzy‘s trumpet and Joe‘s Icad's—
ncvcr overpowering, but noticeably
"there.

The remaining five pieces. two by
Gillespie and three other jazz stan-
dards, bccomc merely further cx-
rrmplcs of the abilities of these men.
Though many of the pieces were
written years ago. thcir presen-
tations on the album are timeless in
nature. and classic in performance.
Mrrny artists can create a solid
album with new material, but to
produce a new album with old
material in such a way that it sounds
as if it had just been written is rare.

chance on this and the followingcut.
where his innovative chops show he
can handle rind rrxc along with the
best ol'rhem. "Mediterranean" is the
last song and isti funky conglomera-
tion of good percussion and solo
work by keyboard flute and guitar.

Side two offers some soulful cuts
like Otis Redding‘s “I Can‘t Turn
You Loose“ and the Paul
Williams/Roger Nichols hit “I
Won‘t Last A Day Without You",
On the latter cut it‘s till Herbie

drawn out but srrvcd by the guitar of
Bob Mrtrm. His guitar Iicksarc clean
and refreshing.

Herbie Mann churns out some
more good music with his last two
cats, “Iiirds of Beauty“ by Stevie
Wonder and “Guava Jelly (rub it on
my belly)". Again his flute
dominates in a distinct style all his
own.

With this album Herbie Mann
satisﬁes a wide spectrum of record
buyers. 'I‘hosc ofyou who like dance
records will be just as pleased as
those interested in good
