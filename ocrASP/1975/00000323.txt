Freedom to discuss research may
be jeopardized by a new SUNY
Research Foundation patent waiver
agreement now being distributed.
SUNYA Chemistry Professor J .l'
Zuckermun calls it a “gag rule" and is
spearheading an effort to rescind it.

SUNY Research Foundation at-
torney Joesph Cairo. hOWever. says
the new form merely simpliﬁes the
process by which professors agree to
protect the patent rights of their
research sponsor.

Zuckerman plans to present a
resolution condemning the agree-
ment form at this afternoon‘s

sunya faculty meeting.

The form was drafted by the
Foundation and includes a memo
which states that agencies of the
federal government require that all
researchers sign such an agreement.

Zuckerntan describes it in another
way: “It‘s scandalous. an outrage!
it‘s a gag rule — there isn‘t a univcr~
sity that operates under a rule like
this. The enforcement of [the agree-
ment] would make a professor ship
at this university Worth about five
cents."

Although there are several points
he takes issue with, Zuckcrman‘s
grievance deals mainly with a single
clause. This clause states that a
professor working under the agree-
ment “will not disclose any informa.
tion. knowledge or data relating to
such discoveries or inventions to

others, without the written approval

of the Foundation. until such timeaa'

a patent application. . .has been filed
or it has been determined by the
Foundation that no such application
is warranted.“

Zuekcrman. who has extensive ex-
perience in both industrial and
academic research. claims that this
clause would prevent him from diln
cussing much of his work with
students and colleagues. “Halfofmy
fun is makingthesethings and halfof

my fun is telling everybody about 'I, ,

says Zuckerman, “and that‘s why I
work for SUNY “

Cairo. however. says that the
agreement only prevents disclosun
of inventions or discoveries that III
“novel and significant". not every
new things tail is produced in the
lab. According to Cairo. a professot
should be able to distinguish
between the two. An expert. he says.
“is going to know when he's come up
with something significant." He
went on to say that most inventions
are not patented. anyway. Only three
or four patents have actually been
applied for in the past year. says
Cairo.

Cairo asserts that the patent
waiver agreement aims at preventing
a researcher from describing the
details of an invention to those who
would stand to gain by applying fora
patent before the research sponosr.
“We‘re aiming at disclosure with

Chem Prof Condemns Patent Policy {evision

Chemistry Protasaor J.J. Zuekarrnan elalma that a new patent waiver and release form
now being distributed by the SUNY Research Foundation would put a “gag rule" on un-

pecially those in private cor-
porations." says Cairo.

Cairo emphasized that the agree-
ment does not prevent publication of
research results. as long as the
publication includes a reference to
the fact that patent rights are reserv-
ed. “If a researcher can throw
anything into the public domain. by
default. the sponsor would have lost
the patent right.“

“l‘ve been shocked to see how
many professors. ..either have a very

lvaralty raaaarehara.

bud attitude toward the Foundation ‘

or. . . hate us." says Cairo. “We're a
non-proﬁt organization. We don‘t
maintain piles of gold in the base-
ment.“

In spite of Cairo's reassurances,
Chairman of the Chemistry Depart-

'ment Antony Saturno, issued a

memo advising that all faculty
members here withold their
signatures until certain clariﬁcations
have been received. This was
prompted by the contention of

Zuckerman and other concerned
faculty members that the “will not
disclose" clause is in conﬂict with
SUNY Board of Trustee policy. This
policy provides that all faculty
members “may without limitation
discuss [their] own subject.” It may
also conﬂict with a Trustee Resolu-
tion which states that “any research.
. .programs. . .shall be unrestricted
as to the dissemination publicity of
the conduct. progress. and results of
such research.”
