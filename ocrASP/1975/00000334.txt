Art Gallery

The University Art Gallery in the
Fine Arts building has opened its
doors with a retrospective exhibition
containing the works of Garo
Antresian and Clinton Adams.
These distinguished artist-teachers
have played prominent roles in the
development of lithography in the
United States. The exhibition
contains a representative cross-
section of the artists‘ work from I950
to the present. »

Together their work offers an
exciting record of the progress of
lithography as it is reﬂected in the
work of these two masters of the
medium. This exhibit will be at the
gallery from now until September
28.

Concurrently. a. week long
exhibition of the recent work of our
own faculty members will be on
display. Older and newer members
of the Art Faculty will be presenting
works in many media including
sculpture. painting. printmaking.
photography; and ceramics. This
week long exhibition as well as the
lithography exhibit may be seen
‘du'ring the gallery‘s regular hours:
Monday through Friday 9 to 5. and
Saturday and Sunday I to 5.

Always Heard ltshould lie”and the
artist—Carly Simon.‘ Bitt’she isn't
shy or quiet anymore.

Carly's new album.Playfng
Possum. is witness tothat fact. It has
a [boldness and brasainesa never
before appearing'in Carly's work

and yet it retains that characteristic ‘

richness in her vocab that makes
anything she sings easy listening.

.From the fastipaced hit“Attitude

Dancing” to the smoothly rippling
"Waterfall" to the soft tender “lsook
Me in the Eyes". Carly's golden voice
rises above her talented back-up and
seeps into the ear. surging and swell-
ing with new-foundemotlon. In the
wistful ‘Sons of Summer" Carly
proves her vocal mettle by movineg
deliveringthreezparthannuny witha
solo piano accompaniment.

The most outstanding number on
the album is the rollicking. jazzed-up
“ More and More". which
collaborates the auspicious high-
caliber talents of Ringo Starr and
Klaus Voorman. with Dr. John giv-
ing an impressive honky-tonk per-
formance on piano. The album is in-
deed star-studded; also contributing
their abilities are Rita Coolidge.
Carole King and. of course James
Taylor. 'More and More" may be a
sign of things to come in Carly's
music. for she has greatly improved
the quicker vocal style introduced in
her rendition of “Night Owl" on No
Secrets.

However. all is not roses with
Playing Possum. Some of the songs
seem repititious and slip into a non-
descript mediocrity. The two open-
ing cuts are slow-moving and fail to
impress. with melodies that escape

' ‘ Lillilﬂl‘ikalﬂlulﬂﬂ”

Mo uvmo

 

the memory. Likewise. the title cut is
a disappointment. a balhd that
strives too hard to lyrically achieve
more than it actually does. Yet Carly
seems quite at home with her new
daring style. and whether or not
these drawbacks can be overlooked
is left up to the individual listener.

Carly Simon has freed herself'

from the melancholia and dis-
illusionment dominating former

albums. Perhaps it is her content-
ment at home which causes her to
write:

Sim! around the ﬂoor in a new at-
ttrutle.

Any attitude is the proper at-
tirade.

Don't be afraid to change your at-
titude.

Free up your .rpirit with a new at-
titude!

Whether it's to celebrate the end of

of partying or just a late dinner.
twenty-four hour restaurants are
needed by college students.

Albany is not a large city. but
there are enough twenty-four hour
places within easy access from the
two SUNYA campuses to provident
least a nominal amount of choice.

Everyone has been to Dunkin'
Donuts. right outside the Western

pus. lt is possible to walk there and
also to Steak and Eggs Kitchen.
further down Western. Neither of
these places are particularly good.
and they have no atmosphere. but
they are reasonably priced and the

food is edible.

Within walking distance of the
downtown dorms is Dandee Donuts.
located on Madison between 0n-
tario and Quail. and is no differeent
from any other donut place. A better
choice is Jerry‘s. right next door to
Dandee‘s. lt's a clean. well-lighted
place. the food is good and the prices
are about what you would expect.
It‘s also just about the only place in
Albany where you can get your
hands on a good bagel.

A car opens up the twenty-four
hour eating door. The best place is
Denny's. a ten minute ride on Wolf
Road. The food is excellent. as-

Pink Panther 5 -
No Flawless Gem

by Kevin Thomas .

Most moviegoers agree it is rare that a sequel be as funny. dramatic or
enchanting as its predecessor. Whilc lllnkc Edwards‘ “Pink Panther" with
Peter Sellout was neither dramatic nor enchanting. it was funny. and so is
“I'hc Return of the Pink Panther“.

Many "sequels" IIIc cash-in efforts by a studio whcrcin VII riousacsthetic or
qualitative aspects of the first filIn become victims of short-s'nhtcd
cconomi/crs or undcr-cslimtttcrs of the American public. Somehow. the
l’lIIII/lt'l‘ series has few enough aesthetic and cinematic fine quulilics that they
how not been lost from thelirslIIquIrunccol'thc ptInIhcrthroughitslntest.

Which is not to any "Return" is not funny: iudccd. it is. but its humor is not
bcsI dcscribcd as of line cinematic quality. Sellers and Blake have put
Iogcthcrn \cry good blcnd ol‘slnpstick and vaudeville comedy.complctc with
running jokcs‘. sight gags and it few (but not tooInttnylobviousone-liners.

llu: Pink Panther is “the world‘s largest and m at vulunblcdinmond". It is
stolen lrom its place of rest in :I Middle [East museum. l’ctchcllcrs continues
lhschttructcr of Inspector CloIIscIIII ol' the French Surctc. the butnhling but
very luck gl'IttltII'nII' who had something to do with the recovery ol‘thc stone
when it \\‘:|h stolen the last time (in The Pink I’llIlI/lt‘l'). Very good

(iron! l’lumlom. who stole it the lust time. but apparentlynot this Iitnc.nnd
by Herbert l.t)lll as Chief Inspector Drcyfuss. Clouscttu's exasperated
superior.

In places The lft‘llli‘ll “fl/11' Pink Panther slows. but the pace is picked up
quickly. with aI mum to fast-moving action. In some points the plot twists
too mucan nd ll ppcII Is not to have been cared for much during screenwriting.
the IthI of the diamond in lhc very beginning seems to be uIrricd off too
easily. almost ignoring some of'tlic carefully described security precautions.
(Like how does the thief keep the alarm in the weight-sensitive pedestal from
going off?) llul the humor of the whole picture makes up for these holes.

The title cartoon of the pink panther anti his pursucr is here again. and
quite amusing even in its cnmco Itppcttranccttl the end. Henry Mancini isnlso
buck. doing his now-classic theme music and the background score.

All in all. RI'IIII'II of the Pink Pulllllt‘l‘ is II worthwhile evening's
entertainment. especially for I’IIuthcr. Sellers. and (.‘louscnu inns.
