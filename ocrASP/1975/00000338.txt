AAB Surplus Frozen Pending Investigation

Athletics Director Joe Garcia sees no need t

budgeting of intercollegiate athletics
here at SUNYA. Its budget ofnearly
$l50.000 represents about 25 cents
of every student tax dollar. Its
membership reflects institutional
control: six studentsand seven facul-
ty members or adtninistrators.

Coyne. who presented the budget~
freezing motion in lieu of an earlier

proposal which Would have effec- .

tively abolish AA B. says the present
situation is inconsistent with SUNY
Board of Trustees guidelines. Accor-
ding to Coyne. these guidelines state
tltat there will be “student control of
student money.“ Coyne also points
ottt that the NCAA. of which
SUNYA is a member. requires iii-
stitutioual control of all athletic
boards. This apparent conflict isone

or any changes in AAB's special relationship with

of the issues being dealt with by the
ad hoc committee.

Committee member Nathan
Snlant discounted the possibility of
resolving this conﬂict by having a
student majority on AA B. “We can't
do that because of the NCAA
regulations." said Salant. Instead. he
says. the ad hoe omtnittee is con-
sidering the formation of“a standing
committee to review all AAB expen-
ditures  which is all Council's in-
terested in. in reality." According to
Salttnt. “It‘s probably. iii the end.
what‘s going to happen.“

"I don‘t tltiitk l‘d care for it.“ said
director of Athletics .loc (iarcia.
when asked what his reaction would
be to such a committee. He asserted
that the Athletics Board "thoroughly
discusses policy" and that students
were in the majority dtiring, last
year's budget voting anyway. Accor-
ding to (iarcia. the idea of such a
laisoti comtnittcc has not yet been
formally presented to him. “I‘d like
to know more about it." he said.
“Maybe it might be the best thing in
the world I don't know."

Currently. Cottncil votes on the
athletic budget in one lump sum~ it
can either approve it or reject it.’|‘his
is unlike other groups. whose
budgets can be amended by Cottticil
before such a decision is made. “We

should be able to go over the [AAB]
budget line by line." says SA Con-
troller Stu Klein. who chairs the ad
hoc committee. Klein feels that this
would be one way of increasing stu-
dent control over AAB.

Garcia feels that it Would be un-
reasonable. “If they want that much
student control. what . . .do they
need an athletics director for?" says
(iiircia. “They [AAB members]
represent the student body very fair-
|_v. We do not hitve people with
vested interests." In addition. Garcia
leels that such a procedure as Klein
described “would be very time-
consuming."

What may scent like a student-

that simple. says Coync: “No issue is
L‘\L‘l' ctcnly di\ided students on
one side. faculty on the other." In
this case. Coyne fccls. it‘s "just a
philosophical question of whether
there should be student control of
student money."

Coync praised the efficiency of
AAB and denied that he has any
kind of personal vendetta against the
athletics program. “I am. iii spite of
what you may hear. tijock at heart."
said Coync. "I probably go to more
games than 98 per cent of the
students ltcrc. ljust don't like to see
money thrown away."-

Rathskeller Wall to be Built Despite Delays

by Cynthia llacinli

Almost a year after it‘s incipicncy.
the idea of building a full-length li-
qttor bar with a wall dividing the
Campus Center Rathskcllcr has
become a reality. Delivery ol'the bar.
which is being assembled in New
York City. is scheduled for next
week and construction of the parti«
tion will begin as soon as the bar is
installed. According to FSA direc-
tor. E. Norbert Zahm.thccntire pro-
jcct should be completed in about a
month and the “pub" ready to open
for student use at that time.

The partition is to be built along
the width ol'the Rathskcller.and will
mark ol'l'ahout one-third ofthetotal
room. The actual wall is to be two
thirds o" tltc hciglil of the room atid
will share the brick pattern of the
Rathskeller columns. While func-
tionitig to separate the pub from the
rest ol the Rathskcller. the wall will
be constructed so as to allow fora
tree “on ol drillers lroni the
Rnthskcllcr Main to the pub section.

(when the ciitiic Campus Center is
locked up). has proved more difficult
and as 01' yet has not been solved.

Also in embryonic stages are ideas

as to what sort of entertainment
would be desirable and appropriate
for the pub. So far suggestions have
ranged from rock groups and folk
guitarists. to jam. combos and com-
edians. While much ofthe entertain-
ment will probably be provided by
professionals. studcttt etttertainers
who wish to gain exposure, will be
welcome to perform.

Feelings about the outcome of the
pub. from those closely involved
with the project. are generally
favorable. Andy Bauman. Student
Association President.whose efforts
to attain the pub became a major
part of the political platform upon
which he was elected. had this to say:
"it's going to be fantastic! l'm hop-
ing that tltc pub will fill what I think
is a real void in campus life.“

Basically Optimistic

IV'SA Director E. Norbert Zahm.
while harboring a basically op~
timistic attitttdc about the bar‘s be-
ing built. has “rcsenations” about
the building ofthc pa rtition. He feels
that sectioning part of the
Rathskellcr as a bar area. may prove
scll-dclcatiug. especially if it is un-
able to accommodate large crowds.
i\tltith‘t' issue which might make
/ahm hesitant about the wall is the
luct that a similar wall. which was
built as piirtol'thc Campus Center in
NM. was torn down by student re-
quest about No years later. Neil
lirowu. Dean of Student Affairs.

said that the main reason for student'

discontent was because tltcrc was a
strong spirit of cliquishness within
the confines of the wall.

l'o most individuals the sitbjcct of
the Ralhskcller is novel aitd
sometimes even interesting.
However those who have brought
the plans from infancy to actuality
have experienced the tediousness in-
herent to arty such scheme. The pro-

ject scents to have had an overabun-
dance of setbacks. dtie to a great deal
of bureaucratic red tape and a
general lack of communication
amongst the involved parties.

The idea for the pub evolved and
took shape in the fomi of a bill.
dated October 30. l974.prcscntcd to
Central Council by Andy Bauman.
calling for the renovation of the
Rathskellcr into a “college bar" type
facility. After several meetings it was
decided that the financing cost of
converting the entire Rathskellcr
were too high. FSA endorsed and
tigiéd to finance a permanent full-
length bar in the Rathskeller. Since
the renovation of the Rathskeller
was impossible. sectioning off an
area for the bar seemed to he the next
best idea. The problem there was to
find funding for the construction of
the wall. After much haggling with
different groups in order to obtain

the “noun the FSA Board of

Constructlon of the long

Directors agreed in March. to
finance the building of the wall.

It is at this point that the facts
become sketchy and answers to why.
when ttitd where fail to coincide with
each other. I'hc pub. which was stip-
posed to be cotiiplctcd over the spr-
ing recess. Wits evidently held up by
red tape policies. The next comple-

.tiou date was set for the summer of

1975 and at the end of June. the
Lewis Equipment Company was
contracted to construct and install
the bar. Tilt: Physical Plant was
originally responsible for the
hiiilding of the bar and wall.
liowevcr. water damage to the
downtown campus made it
necessary for them to devote i: great
deal of time to repairs, making it im-
possible for them to undertake the
entire project singlchandcdly.

The Lewis Equipment Company
in turn. entlisted the Alpine Coni-
pany (which belongs to SA Vice

«r

l’rcsidcnt Rick Mccklcr's father). to
help fabricate the bar. Some un-
known obstacle furthered the delay
and it wasactually onc ' kago that
the Lewis Company received the OK
to begin construction. from the FSA
and passed the word onto the Alpine
Company.
Questions Remain

l'hcrc are still questions which re-
main unanswercd and "facts" which
remain questionable. The work on
the bar has begun through and by all
indieationswill proceed according to
plan. Why it took such an exor-
bitantly lengthy amount of time to
initiate the action. cannot be deter-
mined from scanty and contradic-
tory facts. This statement was made
by one university official when asked
about the numerous postponements
of tire project. “1 don‘t want to be a
part of that controversy. I don't feel
anxious euought to get uptight
about it."
