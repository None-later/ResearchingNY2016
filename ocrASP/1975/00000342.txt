Currently appearing in the University
Art Gallery are two exhibitions. The se-
cond floor is dominated by a one-man
retrospective exhibition featuring the
work of Care Antresian from l950-to the
present. The first floor is occupied by a
collection ofcurrent artistic achievements
produced by members ofthe Art Depart-
ment faculty. Included are works in
tnetal. plastic and porcelain sculpture.
photographs. lithographs. intaglio prints
and water and oil paintings.

Gare Antresian is an lithographer of
surprising ability who presently enjoys
eminent standing in the art world. His
prints are characterized by an‘ inventive
approach to form and color. Largely self-
taught. he was introduced to the medium
while a student at the Arsenal Technical
High School in Indianapolis in I939.
During W.W.II he enlisted in the Coast
Guard and served timeasa combat artist
in the South Pacific. He returned to prin-
ting in I946 after a short bout with com-
mercial art and has been going strong ever
since.

The show contains numerous examples

of his diverse virtuosity. “Milkweed
Pods" is a monochromatic primitive in
black much reminiscent of Reault. Other
prints frotn the 50‘s are seemingly ex-
perimental attempts at reproducing
representational objects in freeform. He
departs from objects in the 60‘s
but continues to experiment. His work
becomes abstract in a world of topsy-
tnrvy violence (characteristic of those
years) and symbolism. In “I’Iate VIII
l‘rom Suitt: Tokens“ (I961). his wild but
controlled Lise of red and black evokes
feelings of fear and distnay which he
further exploits in “Gems” (I963). The
soul is relaxed once again in simpler
pieces as “New Mexico" and “Arcs”.

I905 proves to be a year in which he has
undergone a profound transformation.
Whereas all his fortner work i.
cltaructeri/cd by a very free-moving, noti-
tlelinealcd almost hysterical approach.
his later work has taken an about face.
The live color lithograph “Ojc” marks the
advent of a completely new and
refreshing style. llis experimentation has
matured into a linear and technical
oeuvre. It is exciting . colorful and
diverse.

Ills later work does not draw the bitter
emotions noted earlier. Instead. through
controlled lines and an uncanny sense of
color combination. he has amassed It
collection the strength of which lies in its
ability to arouse vibrant visual pleasure.
For instance: "Untitled" (I972). a mul-

ticolor print with blends. Here is a startl-
ing red ground crossed with varying sized
rods of glowing blended colors.

This is a good example of his in-
novative posture and mastery of color
which have canted for him not only the
praise ofhis peers. but surely a permanent
place in the history of modern American
Art. At present he is a member of the
faculty of the Dept.ofArt ofthe Universi-
ty of New Mexico at Albuquerque.

The faculty show on the first floor is a
collection representative of the abilities of
our exalted mentors. ranging from the ex-
ceptional to the unprofessional.

Mr. Callner. the new department head.
presents oils and watercolor com-
positions which are characterized by a
lack of depth (the eye travels no further
than the surface ofthe panel)and askilled
handling of color in subdued tints and
hues. “Parade to Heaven or Hell“showsa
preoccupation with ﬂoating figures
engaged in no particularactivity, reminis-
cent of William Blake. Hisinventions and
mutations of almost mythological origin
are peaceful. yet demure as opposed to
the true monsters of Breugbel and Besch.
"Promenade" is another example of a
piece whose content detracts from the
lively treatment ofsubducd hues. The pai-
nting consists of four nudes traversing a
terraced walk in a mix of beads and
pearls. Suspended above their heads is a

huge bristly pig whose legs become one
with the heads of these beauties; a truly
empty idea. The saving grace of the piece
is again Callners‘ familiarity with tinted.
pastel-like color schemes.

Bob Cartmell. graphics. has produced
two masterful pieces of color intuglio.
“Peppermint Tree“ and “Chrystal Beach“
are deluged with cooland warm colors in-
terspersed among stark black movements
and at once incite confusion and peace.
These are remarkably balanced com-
positions and truly pleasing to the senses.
They are examples of a mature style. His
interest in carnivals and roller coasters is.
as always strongly apparent. A view of
these two works alone are worth a trip to
the gallery.

Ilowever. disappointment is near at
hand. Next to those are two tnore intuglio
prints which in fact are not intuglio at all.
They appear to be photo-offset prints of
as yet unknOWn origin. lntaglio is iden—
tified by raised and depressed portions of
paper within graphic print (etching
or collograph). "Big I at Luna“ and
"Dogfight" are flat compared to the
aforementioned color prints. It isa pollu-
tion of the gallery. Imagine walkinginto

Donald Mechen, Director of the
gallery. continues to present delightfully
humorous watercolors, the
titles of which havea ﬂavor all their own.

been described as the “Father of' Junk
Sculpture“ and is nationally known for
his pieces of junk. On view are rusty
pieces of metal. One hangs on the wall
while the other is mounted on apedcstal
The pedestal and the wall are frankly
better viewing than the junk.

Melanie Walker. photography,
presents photographic-collage work
which are trite pieces and tend to exploit a
simple meager idea. .

Marc Greenwold. painting, is
represented by one large work.
“Spanish Bedroom". which depicts an un-
likely collection of people lingeringabout
a bedroom. On first sight one is impressed
with its monumental size and its blatant
anti-social nudity. Nudity is not ofand by
itself anti-social. when done with mean-
ing and taste. Here it is meaningless and
tasteless. There are also numerous
technical flaws. He works largely from
photographs. hence his work takes on a
photographic aspect: the lines are strict
and uncompromising. the figures appear
as if they were just pasted on. and upon
close examination numerous pencilled
guide lines are noticeable which he never
bothered to erase nor even cover with one
coat of paint.

After viewing the same subject matter
for ten years. one comes to the conclusion

the Louvre and seeing a magazine

Iy framed and tacked tothe wall. Leonar-
do would turn in his grave.

The illustrations themselves are Dada-
ist in nature in that they try to destroy art
and be art at the same time. He has done
his students and himselfa great disservice
by signing his name to these
abominations. The finest form of
teaching is throuin example. and this is
poor indeed.

better all the time. His ability to create
depth in his pietu res is unequalled in the
department. Not only does he penetrate
the surface of the canvas. but he projects

that Thom O‘Connor knows how to draw
faces. and that‘s all. But at least he does it
well. Thom is an expert lithographer.
though perhaps he could learn a thing or

two from Mr. Antresian and do
something different for a change.

All in all Mr. Mechen has organized
two fine shows well worth viewing. Gare
Antrcsia ns’ lithogm phs may be seen from
now until September 28. Gallery hours
are Monday through Friday 9 to S. and
Saturday and Sunday I to 5.

outwardly from it as well. His
technique is to paint simple objects.
such as wrapping paper or cardboard
taped to a background. Then he trans-
forms the background intoa landscape
or a sky ofazure and cloud. This gives the
objects a whole new and exciting

aura. They look real enough to touch. For
