v. Saturday night at the Campus
Center Ballroom marked the start of
a new tour for Jack DeJohnettc
group called Directions. The group
was formed in January ofthis year.
but saw its beginnings nearly three
years ago with a jam in New Jersey
that included bassist Miroslav
Viious. Jack DcJohnette and
guitarist John Abercrombic.

Sincc that time l)c.iohnelte and
Abercrombic have done a lot of
playing together with Dave Holland.
licnnic Maupin. and .Ian Hummer.
During a short break in touring over
the summer. the group replaced
bassist l‘ctcr Warren with Mike
Richmond. a common friend of
.lolm Abcrcrombic and saxophonist
Alcx Foster.

For most of the three hour show.
lhc group relied heavily on material
Irom their new (and only) album.
('usiiiii- Chic/roll. though the group
opcncd the concert with the lillc cut
l'rom .iohn Abcrcroinbic‘s new solo
album. Thin-liars The title aptly

amorphous. loosc.sccni ingly endless

it wasn‘t until the second time.
“Untitled Reggae Number 1“. that
the group realized how poor the
Campus Center sound-system was
(and which all groups playing there
must use). The piece is a fairly
melodic one. involving strong suit.
lines. Unfortunately. every time
Foster played through the PA mikes.
thewholc system overloaded and
distorted.’i‘o compensate for this
technical problem. he played
through his own amp when possible.

Different ' fractions” .*

2 With all these problems considered.

Foster proved to be an admirable
combatant to the sound system.
overcoming the problem and still
playing excellently.

The group closed out the first set
with. two tunes. one by Steve
Swallow. bass player with the Gary
liurton (iroup. called “Eiderdown”
(which appears on Fannie Chicken)
and another tune from 'I’iim'lm's in-
volving just l)c.iohncttc on piano
‘and Abcrcromht‘c on guitar. entitled
".3 .ovc Song". it was becoming quite

obviousthough. that the musicians
were getting “pissed-oil“ due to the
PA system .

"the second set opened with Jack
Deiohnettc playing sixophone
along with Alex Foster. The second
involved more. and lengthier solos
by the tour musicians. The final
number. “The Last Chance Stomp“.
involved scycrul soios.each one aim-
ed nl showing a different cm in jazz
history (such as lie—hop. Swing.
Rock-jazz. cte.). The piece is a good
onc. btit marred by the frustration

vindictive on his drums.
. Aside from the sound

'Johnette. who became very loiidand '

item dif-

cornfortabie. or at ease in the Com-
pus Center. as compared to such

laces as the Bottom, Line in New
cork. For the music that the Igroup
played. a blend of lie-bop. toe .and
nutnt-garde 'an. the audience was
rcceptiveun amiable.

Just as there was a strain on the
musicians. there wusulso one on the
uudicnce. Sitting in rows may be
standard for rock concerts but is not
too pleasant a situation for a group
accustomed to playing clubs
throughout the world.
