New Student Affairs Dean Seeks to
Familiarize Students with Services

by Joan Ellsworth

Sue l’ierce. new Acting Assistant
Dean ftir Student Affairs.’and other
student resource organizations are
trying to “get a better handle on stu-
dent needs." In a new experimental
program. these grottps are attemp-

, ting to reach the new and off-armpits

student through a drop-in centerand
newsletter.
Pierce explains that one of the

problems encountered by studentsat
SUNYA is “not knowing ttbout the
services at the university.“ Now.
special informational meetings on
the quads and a new student drop-in
center will extend orientation ser-
vices.

As part of a coordinated effort
which began last spring. personnel
from the Student Affairs Office. Un-
iversity College. Counseling Center.

dent Activitics arid other ctunpus
groups will be available at the
meetings and drop-in center to
answer student questions and help
with problems The center is
scheduled to meet every Tuesday
and Wednesday from I 1 :l5 to |:30 in
the Campus Center l’atroon
Lounge.

l’iercc explains that the present
experimental programs have grown
out of an increased awareness by
campus resource offices that they
“were not sensitive enough to the
needs of specific groups."

Off-campus students at SUNYA
have special needs different from
resident students. A new bi-rnontltly
strident rtcwsletterwillattempt to in-
crease tltcsc students‘ awareness of
both on arid off ctitnpits intorittation
and service facilities.

The Strident Affairs Office
currently serves as a resource center
for information on many on~uimptis
facilities. bitt ultimately the office
would aim to provide more informa-
tiort on off—campus services.
Students may now use the Office of
St tidciit Affairs to air particttlar ad-
ministrative problems they may be
having or find out where they cart go

Supervisor of Maintenance in the

1 Campus Center Frank Hoban says

that although he secs ""0 "3111
problem" with the new $l08.000 key
system. he does not think that It is
helping to prevent crime as it was in-
tended to do. The system was in-
stalled iii all of the buildings on the
academic podium in December.
l‘)74.

I'Ioban says that a considerable
amount of the burglaries take place
dtrririg the day when all ol‘the doors
are unlocked anyway. Of the Citin-
pus Center he said. "This is the
student‘s building. Anytlting that
happens here is for the betterment of
the students...lrt the other buildings
they just don't pay that muclt atten-
tion." Ilc elaborated by saying that
when a studctit is seen carrying a
typewriter. lor exatnply. it is often
assumed that he has permission to
take it. It is very easy tojust walk out
with something. I

[lie plan was origittally thought
necessary because of the easy
dttplication of the old keys. It had
becortie impossible to determine
how many keys were ottt arid who
had tltctn. Director of the Campus
Center Alice Corbin estimates that
there were approximately 250
master keys out for that building
alone. It was the potential for
robbery that led to the developntent
of the new key project.

That potential is cut considerably
dtic to the difficulty in the duplica-
tion ol‘lhe new keys. Any rcgularkey
can he cut in several localstores. But
the new keys. with a special cut. re-
quire extra machinery even for a
locksmith. Forthis reason. it is much
easier to keep track of the numberof
keys and to control their duplica-
tion. However. no material evidence
could be produced to show that a
decrease in burglaries ltasoccurred.

Mr. Ilobart agrees that it is more
difficult to reproduce the keys. but
also statesthat many oftlte robberies
are caused by carelessness. and not
by entry with a key. Things are takett
when doors are left itnloekcd or
when they are left on desks. These
are "people problems“ having
nothing to do with the keys.

Several other factors combine to
make the system ritorc “secure.”
Some of these factors. however. also
present problems.

One of the major problems is 1|th

SEPTEMBER 9, 1975

 

by Brent Klgner
A student seeking justice within
the state's labyrinthine bureaucracy
may find his plight similar to that of
the ill-fitted K.inKafktrt's“'l'rial“.0ne
such student was Daniel Sachs. who
painted his room in

News the fall of I973. Along
with his roommate.
M'lym Sachs was billed $30

the following summer
and. returning in August to find
himself barred from his bedroom.
decided to pay the bill.

Meanwhile Sachs had appealed to
Housing on the grounds that he had
not damaged the room rather he
ltad improved it by making it more
“liveable”. The appeal was denied by
Onondaga l-Iall Director 'l‘bornas
Daley “since painting the walls.
regardless of its aesthetic value.
alters the condition of the rootn
which must be defined its damage."
Daley claimed that the Housing cott-
tract gave ltirntltc right “as landlord"
to tlcliite what damage was dottc.

Cortviticcd that further appeals
within the University system would
prove ltttilc. Sachs headed for
Albany Small Claims Court. Nor-
ritally. a tenant with a grievance catt
pay $3.20. file a srtit against his
landlord aitd settle tltc case on his
own iii a small. infornuil hearing. ,
llttt Siiclts' landlord was tltc State
Iiniicrsity til New York the case

 

 

 

was thrown out of court.

A case two decades ago. State Un-

iversity v. Syracuse University..es-
tablished the University as an in-
stmmentality of the State and
brought it under the State's umbrella
ol‘sovereignimmunity. This doctrine
renders the State immune from any
lawsuit except when it specifically
waives its privilege. Upon being
notified of Sachs‘ disc. Deputy
Assistant Attorney General Artltur
’atanc wrote to Judge Wlialen of
Albany City Court asking for dis-
missal on the grounds that the Court
lacked jurisdiction. The motion was
granted.

Theoretically. thcrc retnained one
final litre of attack. The State may
give a claimant permission tti sue it.
bttt any stich suit must he brottgltt itt
tlte Court of Claims. a formal. full-
scalc state court. As legal fees alone
would hate outweighed any possible
heltclit front a suit iii the Court of
Claims. Sachs ribartdorted the idea.

In it last cl'l'ot‘t. Sachs appealed to
Attorney (ieneral I.clkowit7. for
help. He based his plea on a letter
l.cl'kowil/ ltad writtcrt to SUNY
Chancellor Ernest Beyer five months
earlier forbidding the university
lroitt levying Iincsor ltoldittg records
for \iolations ol campus cotidttct
regulations. While tltc university
could collect rcmuncrtitiott for ad~
ntiitsttathc or other costs. neither

 

Housing, Injustice- ‘  ~  in 

written law nor legal precedent
iiuthori/es the university. either ex-
plicilly or itnplicitly. to levy pertalties
for rule violations. Only if painting a
room constituted real damage arid
necessitated rcpuirs cottld a student
be billed lor it. At the time of his
letter to l.elkowit/ nearly a year
alter the original billing Saclis'
roottt had not hectt repainted.

Sachs notes that sineethe prohibi-
tioti against the use of paint is
entered in the liottsing contract
separately train the damage clauses.
cannot be construed r'v mucus
tlatnagc. According to Residence
Director .loltit \Velty. whcrtevcr a
student pttittls his walls without per-
ntissioth is necc.. ty to sand and
repaint tlietit.

 

l’atane. responding to Sachs‘
letter to l.ctko\\it/. did riot address
the damage question. Instead. he ex-
plained that. as counsel tothe Sttite.
it would he improper for the At-
torney General to intct'cedc on
belinll o! a claimant against the
State. l’ritanc sllggeslt‘d that Sachs
"trike lllr' matter up with the unher-
sity." I'l'ltsllttlt‘tla Sachs ga\e rtp.

After an explanatory commentary
by Chairperson David Coyne. the
Council urtrmitnously accepted his
“Revised Committee Structure" bill
(757(i-l2). As the tattoo suggests the
bill dealt prinitirily with a partial
reorganization of the Council‘s coin-
iiiittec system. Specifically it
elitnirtatcd the On and Off Campus
Student Life Cotntnittee along with

Accordittg Io Coytie the reasons
for the changes were that certain
aspects of the old structure were
divisive and that the new one would
eliminate this by rivtiidirtg situations
where with sintilaraimstlikc the old

As important as tlieactual content
of the bill was the omission ol'a sce-
tiori from the origirtal proposal
which would ltave disbtrttdcd the
Athletic Advisory lloartltAAlli and
possibly jeopardired the university's
'rttcntbcrsltip itt theNCAA. Saying
that he didn't want to “rant anything
down the Council‘s throat"

Chairperson Coyne temporarily
abandoned his direct atlrtckstrgainst
the AM! arid the present system of
funding intercollegiate sports.

In other action the Council took a
step towards making each qutid'x
Food Committee more t'esponsivetrr
tltc students. lly a vote of In to | it
approved a bill (757o—ll)proposed In
.lay Miller (Dutch) which
recommends that a representative in

students three times a month for

each committee to publicirc
themselves arid their activities so as
to lneilitate ttttdcrstanding ol them
