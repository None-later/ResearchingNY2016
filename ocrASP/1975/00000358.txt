In Palesinian eyes. Israel is no
longer a tough. purehairted pioneer
nation. As the press exposes finan-
cial scandals and Government cor-
ruption in high places. the un-
precedented rate of inﬂation (more
than 40 per cent a year) provokes
strikes. demonstrations. and riots
among the underprivileged. especial-
ly Jews of Eastern European origin.
Signs of the recession have surfaced
in various branches of the economy,
with unemployment. already at
about the 20,000 mark and threaten-
ing to increase.

movement. too. Immigration declin-
ed 42 per cent last year from l973

German trade unions did not. like
their Hritisli equivalents. see their.
role as one of opposition to the
Government or to the represen-
latich of capital in a free enterprise
economy.

\Vorker's‘ participation in
management is seen also means to in-
tegrate themselves more closely. to
accept a greater responsibility for the
whole economy. They would always
be t , ' ' ', loyal to the State and
its oflicial organizations. however.
Despite external appearances West
(icrmair trade unions are more
powerful than their British.
American. French. or lialian
colleague. their strength lies in the
extraordinary discipline and loyalty
oi their 7.4rnillion member's. People
often merlook the lact that the many
strikes in Britain and ltaly are a sign
ol the weakness and not the strength
ol their trade unions.
