Springfield. So‘uthem Connecticut. ‘

Norwich, .and Albrlght," says Ford.
“and that makes our schedule as
tough as that of any other NCAA
Division III school." '

In addition, the Danes will meet
the Ithaca Bombers. last years‘
Lambert Trophy winner‘s (number I
in small college football) at Albany.
September 20 at l p.m., for the ﬁrst
meeting between the two teams.

Albany in only the second year of
a varsity schedule. led the nation in
rushing with an average of 36l.6
yards a game. Number four in total
offense, the Danes averaged 482.4
yards a game and 40.8 points. good
for number three in the country.

The entire backﬁeld. the main
thrust of Albany's triple option
offense. is returning.

Quarterback John Bertuzzi. who
Coach Ford calls “very ea pablc and
art intense leader". is back at the
helm, directing the Dane offense.

Bertuzzi completed 42 per cent of
his passes last year for4l2 yards and
seven touchdowns. In addition. he
scampered for 299 yards in sixty-six
carries.

Behind Bertuzzi is junior Dave
Altonen.

“It is a pity Dave is here the same
time .Iohn is.“ says Ford.“Dave
would be a starter at any other
school. Unfortunately for Irirrr. .lohn
was here first and knows the system
better.“

The fullback slot belongs to
Albany‘s first l00fl-ynrds gained
runner. l'otn Delllois. who totaled
1006 yards last year.

According to Foul. DeBlois has
not fully recovered frdm a toe injury

suffered the day b‘efdre training"
camp opened. “but when he‘does, he .

willbe awesome. He is up to 225
pounds and still runs the 40-yard
dash in 4.7 seconds.“
Behind DeBlois is Roy Fillbrook.
who Ford is extremely pleased with.
“ He's another big one with speed.“
says Ford, “but right now he‘s

. recovering from a hamstring pull."

The halfback position is well
stocked with both of last years‘
regulars. Orin Griffin and Glenn
Sowulskie.

Sowalskie was second on the
stiuad in rushing, totalling 644 yards

in 70 carries for a 9.2 average. and

led the team in scoring with seven
touchdowns.

“Griff” ran for 620 yards. and was
second in receptions with four, good
for fifty six yards.

Both have excellent speed and are
good blockers according to Ford.

Sophomores Tim Ridgeway and
Dave DuPre, both of whom saw
limited varsity action last year. are
the backups.

“The split end job fight now
appears to be a dead heat." accor-
ding to Ford. as Bob llaxter. Jim

‘l’ollard. and Don Whitcly battle for

the starting spot.“

“Bob blocks well. runs a very dis-
ciplined pattern. arid has good
hands.“ l-‘ord continued. "I guess he
has a very slight edge.“

“But Pollard and Whiter Irave
been putting on some pressure. You
can see how much they want to play.

and Whiter caught for I43 yards
last year.”

If there is one giant hole in the
Danes? offense. it’s at the tight end
position. Tom Clear-y, last years
starterﬂleftra gaping hole-when he
left Albany.

“He was one of the greatest
athletes ever to attend State."
lamented Ford. “and hisabsence will
hurt.“

This brings us to the most impor-
tant positions, and according to
most coaches. least recognized: the
offensive linemen.

“The center and tackle spots are
set, but the guard positions are up
for grabs.“ says Ford.

“Andy Lee will be back at center.
flanked by Dom Roncome and Ty
Curran at the tackles. Both Lee and
Roncome will be giving away
pounds. but we‘ve won before with
them. and they will stay.

As for our guards. we've got four
possibilities: Bruce Court. Gary
Manilenko. John Russell.and Steve
Abra moviclr fighting it out."

The kicking game will once again
rest on the foot of socccrstylc booter
Al Martin. who tallied 44 extra
points and 3 field goals last year. irr-
cluding a 47 yarder. and who will
also Irarrdlc kickoffs.

Veteran Mike Mann (averaged 37
yards) and newcomer lid Sellers will
split the duties as punters.

“let‘s face if. things will be
tougher than last year." sums up
l-‘ord. “but we have a hetterclnb than
last year. and we \\ ill be there. We‘ll
be strong.“
