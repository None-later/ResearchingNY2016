Last year. the team won its first

Suspect Still at Large

by Stephen Dzinanka
and David Winzelberg

Approximately $|.000 was robb-
ed Tuesday from a student run bus
service in tire Campus Center lobby.
University Police reported.

According to Assistant Director
of Security Joint chigltarr the
suspect approached the ticketselling
table of Campus Happenings. Inc. at
approximately 2:30 pm. and threw a
hot cup of coffee in the face of the
lone seller. chighan stated that the
suspect then grabbed a cardboard
box containing about $700 in cash
and $300 in checks and lied out of
the building onto the podium.

“All I heard was change falling on
the floor." rccountcd a jewelry ven-
dor. "it ltappcncd so fast. There was
a lot of people around. "

chighan indicated that people at
adjacent tables saw the suspect.
“There were at least two witnesses
who saw the guy." said chighan.
He explained that two or three
eyewitnesses aided a police artist in
drawing the composite sketch ofthe
man.

Director of Albany Operations
for the bus firm. Howie Krinick. said
that the suspect apparently waited
until the ticket line had vanished
before he approached the table.
“Nobody had the brains to pick up a
phone and call Security. “ complain-
ed Krinick. "The ticket seller had to
call them by himselfaftcr wiping the
coffee out of his eyes." Krinick add-
cd that the seller was “stunne " but
uninjured.

Krinick maintained that his con-
cern for the loss of the money is
secondary. “People's apathy upset
me the most."

Krinick lays part ofthc blame for
the incident on Student Association.

“SA should have notified us about
the Campus Center safe so we could
deposit money periodically . . . l
didn‘t ask them. but they should
have realized that there was a lot of
money involved."

I don‘t think it's ottr fault for not
letting him (Krinick) know FSA had
rt safe. “ commented SA President
Andy liauman. Bauman explained
that FSA generally does not let
groups use their Campus Center safe
for fear of mixing monies. However
according to Concert Board member
Roger Herbert. their group does fre-
qucntly deposit money with FSA to
prevent a build-up of cash while sell-
ing tickets.

chighan speculated. that  . .

. . he (the suspect) probably stayed

on campus because we responded

pretty quickly.“ He added that “ ...

we don‘t have the personnel to

cover all of the roadways leading out
of the campus.“

University Police Investigator
Gary O‘Connor disclosed that the
stolen checks were recovered
Wednesday by campus security.
Although he could not elaborate.
O'Connor revealed. "We managed
to develop several leads that look
productive.“ The investigator add-
ed. “Wc ltavc fingerprints."

Campus Happenings. Inc. isa stu-
dent owncd and operated holiday
bits service. They have been selling
tickets to SUNYA students on-
campus for four years.

“We will prosecute to the fullest
extent to put the guy away." said
Krinick. The part owncraddcd that
the company is not insured for the
loss. "/

The suspect is described as a black
male. age 20. height S'ti“-5‘l(l". and
slender.

Student Services Budget Cut

by Sue Emerson

Neil Brown. Dean of Student Af-
fairs. certainly would not havcasked
for the budget cuts in student ser-
vice which totalcd $300,000.
However. he does feel that “not all
of the changes (brought about by the
cuts) are bad.“

Dean Brown is responsible for
such areas as counseling. financial
aids. student health service. place-
ment. student life. and many more.
All of these services are funded in
whole or in part by the student scr-
viccs budget.

in an attempt to deal with such a
sizcahlc cut in theallocations for stu-
dent services. Dean Brown was forc-
ed to abolish a number of positions
upon their becoming vacant. Gone
a re fotrr clerical positions as well as
one position each in residence. place-
ment. the Dean of Sttrdcrrts Office.
and financial aids. Also abolished
were one professional position (ad-
visor) irr tltc Office of Student Life.
otrc associate darn in the Dean of
Students Office. 2 physicians in the
Student Health Service. and the
salary of one physician for the
summer of 197a Not only were these
positions vacated by late spring or
early summer and then subsequently
abolished. btrt II more positions
which became vacant between
January and August could not be
refilled trrrtil just recently due to the
late passage of the supplemental
budget. according to Dean Brown.
For the last four or live months.thc
Division of Student Affairs has been
understaffed. rind money has been
tight. According to Dean llrown. it
luts been necessary forthc remaining
stuff to take on more responsibility
and for resources to be redeploycd
and reallocated.

How then can Dean Brown say
that "not all of thecha ngcs are bad?"
Says Brown. "l‘m very proud of the
members of the Student Affairs
Division .. . We haven'tspcnta lot
of time sitting around complaining
about the budget cuts . . . I think

there's been a spirit of‘we‘regoing to
conquer it!" Dean Brown feels that
the staff of the Student Affairs Divi-
sion has responded well to the ad-
ditional responsibility and initiative
that have rcccntly come its way.
The necessity for “tightening its
belt“ ltas forced the Division of Stu-
dent Affairs to stop and critically ex-
amine its many programs and ser—
vices. Not that Dean Brown feels
that too many services are
provided—--on the contrary. he feels
that there are more areas of student
interest and concern which require
examination and possible expan-
sion. Oncsuch area iscarccrcounscl-
ing. But too often. in Dean Brown‘s

Affairs is engaged in an ad-
ministrative self-study of its various
departments.

Not all of the changes due to the
budget cats have been beneficial.
however. Dean Brown feels that
even with the budget cuts the Divi-
sion of Student Affairs is goingto be
able to provide urlcqualc service this
year. When risked if that meant that
Student Affairs was not adversely
affected by the budget cuts Dean
Brown rcplicd. "I‘d like to provide
excel/cur service.“ And while he feels
that the increase in creativity. cf-
licictrey. and responsibility has been

longer necessary or relevant are not

The cut in the allocations for stu-
dent services has meant a close and
careful exa mination of student needs
in an attempt to discover more cf-
ticient and innovative ways of
providing for these needs. Dean
llrown feels that internal lines of
communication have been shortened
and efﬁciency has been increased.

nion that any additional budget cuts
cotrld result in the watering down or
complete curtailment ofsome essen-
tial student services.

It would seem then that Dean.
Brown is not looking at the world
through “rose—colored glasses". but
rather is attempting to deal with the
“reality” of fiscal shortages in the
most efﬁcient. innovative. and con-
structive way possible. Dean Brown
would like the Division of Student
Affairs to be known as an “ofﬁce
dedicated to student services."
