MORE BUGGING

Newsweek magazineand The New
York Times are both reporting that
the supersccret National Security
Agency (the NSA) is’ employing
“0rwellian4like computers“ to
monitor virtually every message sent
overseas—to and from the United
States.

According to both publications.
N SA listening-posts are intercepting
not only all civilian overseas phone
calls. but every telegram. telex and
radio message as well.

Nett'sweck reports that NSA‘s
worldwide computer network is
programmed to recognize so-called
“trigger words.“ The magazine says
that when any overseas message con-
tains such words as "agent" or
“heroin'_‘. NSA tape recorders
automatically record and then ﬁle
that "suspicious" message.

The New York Times adds that
other trigger words include "oil".
"Saudi" and even "Mideast." The
newspaper says that every corporate
message transmitted abroad is
carefully scanned for these trigger
words and phrases.

According to Newsweek, “the
NSA is so sccrctivc that it almost
makes the CIA look like an open
book. Even its 'chartcrh-National
Security Council directive number
6 is classified supersecrct.“

The NSA is said to operate on a
$1.2 billion a year budget—about
twice as large as the ClA's. It is so
sccrclivc that its director. General
Lew Allen. has appeared before
Congress only once in the NSA‘s 23-

  
 

year history. General'Allen wai silt-g

ed at the time if his agency regularly‘
intercepted civilian overseas phone
calls: The General replied that it was
against the law for him to answer
that question. ’

 

SEXWASHED UP

A British Scientist is warning that
too many showers may ruin your sex
life.

Doctor Barry Kcvcrnc. a Cam-
bridge University lecturer. reports
that bathing or taking showers
bcforc engaging in sex may clean up
the body too much.

Doctor Kcvcrnc explains that the
part of the brain which controls scx
activity is stimulated directly by the
natural body odors which soap and
water wash away.

The doctor warns that washing
before engaging in sex-rot cvcn
smelling pcrfu mc -- can interfere
with or even prevent sexual perfor-
mance altogether.

If you think there are law and
order problems in your town. then
consider the case of Connellsville.
Pennsylvania.

Seven of Connellsville‘s 23 police
officers. including the police chief.
have been arrested on charges of
burglary. robbery. assault and ar-
son. Thc seven cops plus five
civilians have been charged with up
to 400 separate crimes; and the
Grand Jury says that even more in-
dictments are expected.

Even though the indicted cops
have been dismissed from thelforcc.
what's left of the Connellsville
department complains that morale is
low. A police department sergeant
says that even children are teasing
remaining ofﬁcers.

The sergeant adds: “People just
don‘t trust us anymore. I mean they
don‘t sayanything to us outright. but
you can tell. For example. nobody
calls us anymore to watch their
houses when they go on vacation.
