Grad Student Aid May Be Cut

possibility of their loans being

Financial Aids. Donald Whitlock.

niittctl its fluids and as a result
graduate students and first time
borrowers may become the first to

fice has not yet finished computing
the loans available. Director
Whitloek expects thc statistics to be

However he stated that there may be
a “few lcft hanging." '

Whitlock feels that more students

previous yuirs dtie to the poor job
market this summer.

I \ ci_\ graduate student whose spr-

ing semester loan will be withdrawn

Wliitlock expects to rely heavily on
the work-study program and the
guaranteed loan.

The disadvantage to the New
York State Higher Education Cor-
poration is that the loan is given at a
7V:% interest rate as opposed to the
3% interest rate of the NDSL.

There is a third alternative to the
N081. which Whitlock strongly
urges students to try. The Basic
[Educational Opportunity Grant is
generally available to students
whose family income is no greater
than $ |4.000 This year 765 students at
SUNYA are receiving the grant with
anavcragc ol'$l()00 per student. The
grant may he awarded in any
amounts up to $l300. The grant is

sophomores and juniors. Seniors
may apply to the IJEOG starting
next year. as the program is being
phased in one you at a time.
Applications for the BEOG may be
picked up at the Office of Financial
Aids.

Wliitlock does not feel that any
student will be forced to drop out of
school because of theeutbacks

mare. “When I confronted the
authorities with that. I was told.
“Don‘t worry. there will be someone
here to protect you." She was irate.

Commissioner of Education
Ewald B. Nyquist today ampliﬁed
the proposal he made last week that
the New York City Board of Higher
Education impose tuition charges on
all students attending City Universi-
ty beginning with Spring I976
semester. The Commissioner‘s
recommendation was attacked by
some Board members who claim it
could cause a strain on students
from low income families.

In a letter to Board r

 Propos

Alfred A. 'Giaidino. the Com-
missioner pointed out that theexaet
opposite would be true if his
recommendation were put into
effect. The increased State and
Federal aid which would be
available to most students if tuition
were charged would more thsnoffset
the additional cost to students from
low and middle income families

In his personal lastweek.‘Nyquist
had called for a yearly tuitionof $650

for“ L and r and

$800 a year for juniors and seniors.
which is the same as charged by State
University.

Nyquist cites ﬁgures just compiled
by the Education Department which
show that if this tuition is charged.55
percent of the CU NY un-
de rgraduates who come from
families with gross incomes of SI [.000
or less a year would not be required
to pay any portion of the tuition out
of their own pockets. In fact. he
says. most Would very likely have aid

changes were introduced. These in-
clude the writing up of committee
reports and the distributing of them
between meetings so that time will
not be wasted by the reading aloud
of these reports. Also suggested was
a limit on the length of speeches.
in the future. members of the
Senate will be required to specify
what interest they have in the

     

 

passage ofa bill that they are propos-
ing. New procedure will also forbid
the making of amendments that are
contrary to the intent oftlie original

in excess of tuition to meet other
costs of attending CUNY.

_Nyquist says the Department
analysis demonstrates that the'only
students who would be required to
pay the full tuition charge out-of-
poeket are students who come from
fa milies with adjusted net taxable in-
come over $20.000a year. This is the
equivalent of a gross income in ex-
cess of 525.000 a year for a family of
five with one child in college, the
Commissioner explained. “No more
than l5 percent of the New York
City residents who are full-time un-
dergraduates at City University are
in its group.“

Under the State’s Tuition
A 3W- .v Program. CU NY now
rectvcs only half a million dollars a
year. because only students who are
charged tuition ofat least $200 are
eligible for tuition assistance. If the
University charged tttition at the
State University rate. the Com:
missioncr explained. it could bring
in alsmost $25 million in TAI’
funds for the Spring I976 semester
alone.

ln addition to the Tuition

Assistance Program. students from
families with net taxable income of
about $8.000 or less a year (gross iii-

come of about 811.0%) would be
eligible for various sources of aid
from the Federal government, the
Commissioner says. “Thus. almost
two out of every three full-time un-
dergraduates from families with net
taxable income of $6.000 or less
(gross income,of about Sll.000)
would have their entire tuition
covered by State and Federal aid and
would not 'pay any tuition out-of-
pocket.“ saidihe Commissioner.

The Commissioner goes on to
point out that freshmen and
sophomores from these families
Would receive more aid than thecost'
of tuition. so they would have
amounts varying from SIBB to SI.-
200 a semester after tuition to help
def ray other costs of attending
CUNY. Juniors and seniors in a
similar situation, would have
between $93 and Sl.l00 more,aid
than needed for tuition.

Students from families with net
taxable income between $6.000‘and
58.000 a yea r (gross income ofabout
St |.l)00 to $I3.000) would pay less
than $l50 tuition per semester out—
(if-pocket in their freshman and
sophomore years. and between $140
and $250 per semester in theirjunior
and senior years. he says.
