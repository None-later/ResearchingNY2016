Classes Collect, Distribute Dues

by Frank Castle

Did you ever wonder exactly how
your class dues are spent? . Is
somebody hoardingthe money for a
vacationin Rioor foran illicit affair'.’

Discussions with Bob O'Connor,
senior class president,
and Mark Benecke.
sophomore class
president. proved the
above speculations
false. The class dues. which are
collected by the Bursar‘s office and
deposited with the Faculty—Student
Association (FSA), are spent by the
respective classes on a variety of
functions.

Senior week activities and class

News

Analysis

parties are the biggest spenders but

also included are picnics, movies.
and miscellanea like class T-shirts.
This year, O'Connorsaid. “We also
may give help with finding jobs to
the graduating seniors."

The money thateach class rccieves
duringtheyeardoesnotarrivein one
lump sum. It comes from the Bur-
sar‘s ofﬁce as student bills are
processed. Bills are processed
throughout the entire semester.

It is difficult to determine how

many students will pay the optional
class dues. Therefore. according to
O‘Connor, “the individual class
council has no way tltat they can
budget it [the money]. they canjust
estimate front prcr inn )cttrs.

Out of the Illttt r‘ amount of
money. which O'Connor says can
vary front 53.000 to $6,000, the
various class activities are funded.
He estimates that from $2,500 to $3.-
000 is saved yearly by each class for
their senior week. Each class varies
in size. meaning that larger classes
lutve more money at their disposal.
O'Connor stresses that, “we are try-
ing for quality rather than quantity.
but we are still trying to do as much
as we can."

Bencckc’s attitude towards class
spending slightly differs from that of
O‘Connor's. It seems that the
sophomore class is a large one and
has a high percentage ofdues-paying
students —- about 80 per cent.
Benecke fuels that their purpose is to
cater not only to that particular
class. but also to the university asa
whole. Commenting on the lack of
social life here on campus Benecke

stated, “We feel that since we have
the funds We should spend it on all
the students."

Decisions on class spending are
made by the class council. This body.
which varies in number from class to
class, meets at regularly scheduled
intervals. O'Connor alluded to the
fact that these bodies often have
lintitcd manpower.

llenccke points out that, “the
whole philosophy of class govern-
ment is ttot only a social one. It
should he a channel where pcoplccx-
press themselves and should not be
devoid ofpolitics.“ Healso defended
the integrity oftlte council. “We have
a very open class council. and have
taken many precautions to avoid the
abuse of power." said Benecke. “The
president has noveto power and isa
regular voting member.“

As was previously reported in the
ASP. there have been instances in
the past where classes have had large
sums of money left over after they
graduate. Commenting on this,
llcneckc said,“Throughout the years
there htts been a consen'ativc
philosophy on spending.“

I "Feministtr‘rroaps Hold
' Fourth Rally in Albany

by Adrienne Rlblnowltl

The fourth annual Women’s Day
was held herein Albany on Sunday.
August 7. The day‘s program began
at l2:00 in Washington Park. Ap-
proximately 25 tables were set up in
the park representing a wide spec-
trum of interests including such
groups as: The League of Women
Voters, Albany Women Against
Rape (A WARE). Tri-City Women‘s
Center. Forum of Women in New
York State Government, Speak-Out
(a feminist journal), National
Organization of Women (NOW),
Women‘s Political Caucus and
Planned Parenthood.

The program in the park consisted
of several speakers. music by a
women‘s band called Medusa
Muzic. poetry readings. workshops
in self-defense. women in education
and bicycle repair. Among the
speakers present were Theresa Cook
and Rezsin Adams. who are ruttnittg
in the Democratic primaries for
county executive attd county
legislator respectively. At 6:00 put a
covered dish dinner was scheduled itt
the l‘lfSl Presbyterian Cltttrclt on
Lark Street, to he followed by a
dance at 8200 put in the YWCA.

Relocation Discussed

Several items were emphasized
during the day. one of which was the
relocation. at the YWCA. of tthri-
City Women‘s Center. It is hoped
titat the new center which also
houses NOW. AWARE, capital

 

District women, Marxist-Feminist
Study Group. and Speak-Out. wi1|
serve as a central home for women‘s
activities. The center wants to con.
duct discussion groups, speakers,
Workshops, and feminist performers
in the arts. The center hopes to en.
courage all organizations with a
feminist orientation to make use of
their facilities.

The need for women to become in-
volved in politics and government
was also stressed. Women were urg-
ed to exercise their poweras voters,
especially concerning the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA). which
will be on the ballot in New York
State this November. and to support
the increasing number of Romeo
presently in government or running
for office.

by Ed Moler

Recently I talked to a number of
people who graduated this spring
from SUNYA under either the
Masters orBachclors programs. The
interviews were nothing liken ‘socio-

economic study of the

Ne" participants‘; as a
social studies

Fawn professor might term

it. but were more like
an informal chat.

Naturally, in light of the recession,
most talked at length about looking
for work. What they said backed
today‘s popular image of the pen-
niless college graduate wearing out
his shoes searching for a job.

“I wrote 31 letters asking for inter-
views,“ said Ken Klane. a Business
major graduate. "I got 21 replies. 25

    

 

 

of which Were negative. So I went to

2 interview, and l acceptance." -..

Most stressed are importance of
the impression these interviews
made on the employer. “A resume is
not enough,” said a graduate of
Social Welfare, currently a social
worker. “They test to see if you can
handle questions quickly, if you can
handlcpeople  you reallyhaveto
sell yourself."

One unemployed English teacher,
formerly of SUNYA.had a bitterat-
titudc toward the job market. “The
way to get any job is to know
somebody . . . Quality is involved,
of course, but there are so many
qualified people and so few jobs.“

The same person was angry at
what she said was the prejudice she
had observed as a teacher. which the

mid prevented blacks and women
. from getting good jobs II only “a few
are allowed into graduate school.”

One person now it differently. ny-
ing that a young teacher friend was
denied tenure tomake room for
minority teachers so that alleged
“quotas are fulﬁlled." His friend
moved to Texas, where he landed a
job.
This brings up the question of
where these grad uates look for work.
Many felt the New York State area
was a bad place for a young person
on the up and up.-

Bill Brina. a veteran who just
received his Masters. said of New
York City,"Hey man. I wasin Viet-
nam. One war is enough. I could live
there.“ Others joked of New York‘s
budget crisis. or of the teachers’
strikes in both New York and the
Tri-City area. Laura Petrochko.
with a Masters degree in Russian.
said “the Albany job market is very
bad. unless you want a government
job. As for myself. I‘m thinking of
Boston or Washington.“

Bill Brina said of the state
economy:“lt‘s already done here, the
economy is developed . . . it might
take me 30 years to become a deputy
commissioner (of environment)
here; it might take only l0 years in
the Southwest.“

Despite what tltc above may in-
dicatc. many found work easily. and
for obvious reasons. Sandra
McGurrin, although holding ‘only‘ a
Bachelor in music, is director of a
choir in Nassau. N.Y. The catch is
she‘s ltad the job since she was l6.
and has the credentials of being first
in her class to back up her ex-
pcriertce. ul was nominated to Phi
Beta Kappa. but I wasn‘taccepted. I
'think perhaps because I'm a music
person, they (the electors) thought I
was a little strange,“ she said joking-
Iy.

“Ono's netne tends to get IOIl in the
shuffle of papers (applications. i.c.).
You must penonallyputprcuureon

SUNYA Praised

Besidesjobs. the grad: were asked
about their feelings toward SUNYA
in general. Most were grateful for the
fine education Albany State had
given them, and the opportunities
that have ensued. ‘Albany‘s a good
school‘ and ‘lt‘s highly respected'

were common refrains. 

 
  

 
     

however. put down the social aspect
of the schoolli: » -‘
' crew spoke ll length on this
subject:“l'm from a small town, I

to make friends It SUNYA than'dt I '
my other college. The people It
SUNYA are a little more reroute;

Council Caps Out

by Daniel O‘Connell

During a tempestuous meeting
replete with deletable explctives and
a pounding gavel. the CentralCoun-
cil on September tenth passed and
then voted down bill 7576-17 which
would have set aside a separate seat
on the Council for students now liv-
ing at the Hotel Wellington.

U nfair Classiﬁcation

The sponsor of the bill,Grcg
Lessnc (State),said he proposed it
because he felt that classifying the
Wellington students as commuters
for election purposes, as they are
now. migltt lead to unfair represen<
ttttion for one of the constituencies
involved. Lessnc said that if no one
frotn the Wellington was elected it
would be doubtful that that group
with its unique needs attd problems
would be adequately represented by
someone who doesn‘t live there. On
tltc other hand. he poitttcd out, if the
people at the hotel organized
themselves they could conceivably
capture all six commuter seats and
so leave tltc true commuting students
with a weakened voice in the Coun-
cil. lie concluded his bill would pre-
vent citlter of these occurances by

giving the over 200 students living at
the Wellington their own seat.

Councilperson Lessne‘s argument
proved effective and the bill passed
by a vote of I2-5~0'. however,thc vic-
tory was short lived. Soon after the
vote was taken debate was reopened
when Roger Herbert (Commuter)
complained that he had not been.
given a chance to express his opi-
nion. As the discussion progressed
more and more questions were rais-
cd pertaining to the bill's con-
stitutionality and the basic theory of
representation. When a second vote
was taken the resultwasalmost com-
pletely reversed from the first as the
bill was defeated 6-1 M.

In other action the Council voted
to charge SI admission to non-tux
card holders at the Albany-Ithaca
football game that will he played
September twentieth. The proﬁts
will be used for future capital expen-
diturcs requested by the Athletic Ad-
visury Iloard and approved by the
Council.

The meeting itself was often unru-
ly and several times required
Chairperson David Coync to calm
down the more excited members.
