SMOKE IT DON'T OH I If

A land mrk marijuana easel is un~
erway; in Alaska that could very
well determine. how the federal
government will deal with states
which decriminalizc pot.

The Alaskan legislature and
supreme court have both repealed all
state laws which treat marijuana »
possession with criminal penalties.

Last month, however, the police
revealed that an undentiﬁed Juneau
resident was apprehended for
allegedly growing seven small mari-
juana plants. The cultivation of pot
is legal under Alaskan state law ——
but cultivation is a violation of
federal law.

As a result. the plants have been
over to the Federal Drug Enforce-
ment Agency which says it has
forwarded them for further tests to
its San Francisco laboratories.

Federal officialsin Alaska say that
if the material turns out to be mari-
juana. the U.S. Attorney in Ahska
may decide to prosecute the offender
under federal lawa since there are no
longer state laws outlawing the
offense.

The federal decision is expected to
have repercussions in Oregon.
California. Colorado. Maine. and
Ohio —--— stated which have already
acted to dccriminalize marijuana

A Chicago man-who claims to have

» had recurring nightmares that all his

money would be taken away from
him is having his nightmares come
true.

According to Boston‘s Real

_Paper. it all started when 43-year-old
Robert Friedman was stopped by a
policeman for panhandling in
Chicago. Friedman assured the of-
ficer that he really didn't need the
money and promptly opened a suit-
case to show the policeman 524.187

 

in cash. Friedman reportedly carried
the suitcase with him at all times
because he feared someone would
take away all of his money.

Someone did. Friedman was
brought before a judge. who heard
the story and committed him to a
psychiatric hospital against Fried-
man‘s will. Friedman was ordered to
pay court costs. lawyer‘s fees and
psychiatric testing costs. as Well as
$60 a day in hospital fees.

Friedman‘s lawyers report that
this has cost $l200l) so far. and that
unless they can convince authorities
to set Friedman free. his total life
savings will be eaten up in another
six months.

DEVILS WORK

Colorado Senator Floyd Haskell
has called on the F.B.l. to investigate
the growing number of cattle
mutilations which have occured in at
least l0 western states.

Haskell says he met with F.B.l. of-
ﬁcials in Denver last week in an
attempt to have them enterthe case.

Haskell states that the bizarre
killings have occurred in Colorado
and at least nine other states. He
says:"in virtually all the cases. the
left car. left eye. rectum and sex
organ of each animal have been cut
away. lilood has been drained from
the carcasses and no blood has been
found around the carcasses."

The senator also says he believes
that who ever is behind the
mutiltttions is using helicopters to
land in the middle of fields before
butchering the animals.

Investigators speculate that some
sort of satanist or devil-worshipping
cult is behing the hundreds of ritual
slayings reported in the Midwest and
the West.

An earlier federal investigation
into the killings was abruptly halted
by the US. Treasury Department
for no apparent reason last spring.
The For! Star-Tl'lcgramreportcd at
the time that the investigation was
dropped shortly after the home of
the agent heading up the investiga-
tion was smeared with blood—wan
action interpreted as some kind of
occult warning.

Cellar Door productions. ' the‘

promoters who handle many, big
name rock acts, say that some of the
big name stars write nearly impossi-
ble clauses into their performance
contracts. '

Take Elton John. for example:
when Elton is schelduled to do a
show. his contract requires that the
promoters see to it that a hot sit-
down meal for a least 20 persons is
served back stage. featuring a full
menu drawn up personally by Elton.
Eltonalso requests large bags of taco
chips and a quart of guacamoloteight
bottles of french and gennan cham-
paign. with the brand and years ab-
solutely speciﬁed; fresh vegetables
and fruit for 20; and a case of
Heineken beer.

The Grateful Dead are no easier to
please: they usually demand (and
get) 60 quarts of milk: six cases of
Heineken‘s beer: and steak. lobster
and vegetarian mealsto feed upto 30
people.

The Average White Band isa little
easier: Their only request is “no fried
chicken.“ John Mayall. meanwhile.
asks for nothing else: Mayall always

 

requests fried chicken. particularly
from Kentucky Fried Chicken.

Cellar Door reports it did turn
down one request from an uniden-
tified big name rock group that ab-
solutely demanded six limousines.
That demand was vetoed. Cellar
Door says. because the group has
only ﬁve members——
