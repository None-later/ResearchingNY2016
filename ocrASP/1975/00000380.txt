A Void to the Wise

To the Editor:

It rarely happens that lbccomc so offended.
so outraged. so inﬂamed to the very linits of
my being. that lam compelled to get out of my
chair. Such an occasion actually'arose a few
days ago. the details of which I shall now
recount.

l was in the process of rollingu fewjointsof
some new dope using the latest issue of the
ASP as a working surface. as is my practice.
Doing so. my gaze wandered mindlessly over
the page before meand eventually came to rest
up on a article by Harvey Kojan entitled.
“Conversation Piece." Perhaps it was the
novelty ofcomprehensionpr a nascent panicle
of curiosity which drove me to read on.
Neverthlcss. my brief affair with the written
word. which I embarked upon armed with
only the best of intentions was rewarded not
with instruction and entertainment. but in-
stead horror andgcvulsion.

Mr. Kojan as you may know posits six basic
areas of conversationamongthe inhabitants of
this veneral institution: sex. drugs. food.
grades. weathemind vacations. Hcfurthcrim-
bucs these subjects with the properties of
boredom and familiarity. and concludes his
diatribe with a cynical admonition promising

com. I speak for all of us when Ianswer him
with an unequivocal “So what!". I defy you
Harvey Kojan to respond convincingly to any

of the followint questions and display to me .

the folly of my ways.

 

Why should i either seek or desire to learn
anything not recompensed with credit towards
my graduation. or read anything not assigned
me by some professor? (And none of that
“Joy” of knowledge stuff. Please!) Why
should I be inspired within the framework of
the university when even -my teachers are
seldom educated beyond the rigid confines of
their own ﬁelds? Why should lengage in any
productive eridcavor when even the most
evanescent glow of creativity is summarily
doomed to extinction by my good ol' buddies
and pals? And finally. why should i not be a
willing pawn of the credos and conventions of
an arbitrary age. swaying with the titles of
fashion and bowing to the desultory dictates
of a misguided majority when clearly the
alternative spells hardship (Surely you jest?).
self examination (Not for mel). ultimate
failure (I'm no martyr.) and perhaps. should
conditions grow absolutlcy intolerable. “rank
outs“ (Oh dread)? Or so lam told.

Therefore it is with small regret that lsur-

could use some excitementl“

Upon our arrival. we were stopped at the
door and our l.D.‘s were checked presumably
for age. After my friends’ l.D.‘s were ap-
proved. they paid the admission fee and began
ed and l was detainedfor some very vague and
absurd reason. Obviously lknow it couldn‘t
have been age. because my date of birth
appeared on my out~of-state |.D. along with
my photo and social security number. Later I
was told by one of the managers to present
some New York identification. [responded by
card. 1 was told to step aside and wait. as the
other patrons passed through. This was very
annoying as well as cmbarassing. The
manager was very obnoxious and said that I
wouldn‘t be admitted that night.

It is my opinion that l was discriminated
against very unfairly and unjustly. Mainly.
because I am an out-of—statc resident. and
maybe because of my race. sincehe gave me no
reason to believe otherwise.

I feel very strongly that the manager that
night definitely owes meanapology for his un-
just and rude behavior. He also owes my
friends an apology for hesitating to return our
money after this incident.

I am new to New York state and Albany
and when lleave. lwilltqll of "‘0 unfor-
tunate, incident I encountered here.

have all been used at SUNYA to express student opinion.

The arguements against student participation in tenure decisions are silly; the vital
interest faculty and administrators must take in job security and conditions in their
department color their judgment. and students without vested interests add significant
perspective at least to the kind of teaching it professor is doing.

But students have been denied a vote on tenure cases. lftheir voice is heard during
the various stages of the tenure process and if that voice carries weight. a vote is not es-
sential. But some departments at SUNYA make little use of the teaching evaluation
material they have and. more importantly. do not attempt to it .prove it.

President Fields will have some difficult tenure decisions this year — nothing un-
usual. His task is doubly hard because the faculty is no longer increasing in numbers
and thus the ranks ofthose tenured cannot grow. A healthy univéir‘sity must attract and
keep quality professors and this involves constant pruning of thc" touching staff. Fields
understands the situation here. He has pointed out that relative to the academicquality
of students here. the faculty is deficient. He has given high priority to bringing the
faculty up to it level more appropriate for SUNYA‘s student body. In doing so. we hope
Dr. Fields will not underestimate the importance of good teaching.

On Borrowed Time

Whether New York City is to blame for its own crisis because of mismanagement
and overly generous spending. or the banks are at fault for pushing interest rates
beyond what the risk would justify over the years. the city is in trouble. And with the
State‘s new plan. the state and the banks may be in trouble too.

it is essential that the new seven-mun board controlling New York City‘s finances
succeed in straightening them out. If they fail. the State will have simply delayed
default at a tremendous cost.

The banks are trying to sell the various bonds. but most will remain with them. The
major risk-takers under the new uid plan will be the banks and the state. whose funds
are being tapped for loans. including the state's employee pension funds. The state is
indeed taking a chance. since default is still likely in December. The probability that the
city will at least be credit—worthy by then is low.

Default means the Federal Reserve Board would have to shore up the city bunks.
resulting in inflationary. nationwide increases in interest rates. The State would be in
some trouble. though the MAC-proposed plan passed earlier this week includes setting
tip a legal process to handle del'uult. expected to protect the stiitctis much its possible.

The city‘s last chance runs from now until December. lfit cun bundle the money llow
by then. it may be safe. Otherwise. huge amounts of money will have been wasted on
obtaining it few extra months.
