‘3 Beds
Back ‘
In Mohawk

by Andy [human

The Wellington, a recently foreclosed hotel
located downtown. is filled with students who
were rejected for on campus housing. Why are
we forced into such a desparate plan? Is there
any other alternative? A review of the situa-
tion is necessary.

After two years of servere overcrowding,
Albany State is starting the semester with
less of this overpopulation in the dorms.

The Housing office, however, succeeded in
that goal by merely denying requests to about
400 students for on campus accomodations.
Half were thrown into a decaying hotel
located thirty minutes from campus, while the
other half were simply tthn. At the same
time Mohawk Tower. at stnicturc designed to
house 400 students, remains devoid of any.

This is heralded asa victory by well meaning
administrators. A victory for whom? The
faculty members currently working in the
tower? Certainly not the students. the logical
heirs to any dormitory.

The choice for occupancy of the Tower is
hctwccn faculty mcmbcrs and students tmorc
specifically. incoming freshmen and translcr
students). It should be obvious which ol the
two deserves priority.

Faculty members use the spttcc for what
amounts to a few hours a day. For the
students, it would be their home. Most
students do not own cars for personal
transportation. while most faculty do. Most of
the social. recreational and cultural services
provided on cam pusarc provided and needed
by the students, not by the faculty. Students
cannot leave. nor can they travel to campus
after the buses stop at midnight. The faculty
are not usually here after 8 pm.

SEPTEMBER 19, 1975

I do ttot mean to downplay the importance

of the faculty or their needs, but those needs.

must not be met at the disproportionate ex-
pense of the students.

There is space for 438 beds in the Tower. 'ln-'

cludingthe necessary staff rooms, this number
almost equals the current demand for ad-
ditional on campus housing. 'But what about
those faculty members now residing in
Mohawk? '

The displaced faculty members could either
be doubled up in the single ofﬁces on the
Academic Podium (doubling faculty can‘t be
that bad, after all. students are tripled) or else
they could be relocated at the Draper and
downtown campuses where space is opening
up from the retrenchment of the Allen Center
and Milne School programs.

The final irony ofthis whole situation isthat
the current set-up is costing SUNYA over
$l37.000 in required rent paid to the New
York State Dormitory Authority. This figure
is achieved by multiplying the room rate of
$650 per year by the 438 bed spaces occupied
by the ofﬁces. Then divide that figure in half.
The reason it‘s divided in halfis because of an
arrangement SUNYA has with the Dorm
Authority (a separate issue).

()ncc students mchd into the Tower. their
rcnts would cover this cost while the alter-
nntitc of doubling faculty or moving them to
Drapcr nould bc rcnt free. This windfall of
 l J7.tl(ltlcou|d lhcu bc used to restore many of
the Inculty or student service lines iIt
SllNYA‘s hudch that we thought we were
fnrccd to cut.

So besides being logical and ct hically fair to
students. it is clcnrly economical to house
students rather than faculty in the Mohawk
l'owcr. So why isn‘t it being (lonc‘l'l'his qucs-
tion must be answered. and answered soon!

“Do you flaunt your homosexuality?“

“Well. if by ‘ilaunting it.‘ you mean do I
make public statements about my sexuality,
yes, I do ﬂaunt it. and until lean feel free to
walk down the street holding hands with my
lover, until I can join in conversations about
spouses and lovers and not change the pro-
noun, I will eontinueto. as you say'flaunt it.‘ "

—l'rom a conversation at a Gay Alliance
meeting.
The irony of the above dialogue is that in
reality. ﬂaunling it is in the mind of the
beholder. Usually. gays who are accused of
Haunting it are displaying their sexuality less
overtly than straights. Our behavior merely
stimulates more response in the viewer and to
avoid dealing with those feelings. the viewer
passes judgement (and the buck) back to the
gay person. And so, if we hold dances or show
affection in any public way, we are accused of
Haunting it. When these activities are per-
formed by heterosexual couples. how many
are judged as flnunting their sexuality.

gaudy. ostentatious. conspicuous. impudent
or defiant display. as brazen women“ (we
won‘t commcnt on the brazenly sexist exam-
ple.) We“. really there ain't no such animal.as
Haunting it. because all those descriptive ud-
jectivcs (ostentatious. gaudy. etc.) are
subjective rvnlue judgements that say a lot
more about the judgcr than the judgee. Ac-
tually. the accusation that a gay is Haunting
her; his gnyness says a lot about the personal
discomfort of the observer. And there is a lot
of that discomfort out there (and among us.
too.)
In short. guys are “different.” But our
behavior stands out. not because of what we
