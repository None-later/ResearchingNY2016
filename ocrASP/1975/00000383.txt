: Despite losing. Coach Bob
Munsey felt that his Cross-country
team's performance against a very
strong Boston State team was
“satisfying.” v _

f‘We ran into a real good team
(Boston State's coach Bill Squires
felt it was'the, best team he‘d ever
had) with the potential to really blow

[is out. but we hung in and kept it
tight." said Munscy.

One of the bright spots for Albany
was the performance of freshman

Keith Benman who was named the

Albany runner of the meet. Benman

ﬁnished sixth and his time of 26
minutes. 3| seconds was the 18th
best _by a Albany runner on the
Dane's ﬁve-mile course.‘

“Bermun did an outstanding job
for a freshman in his ﬁrst five-mile
meet." said Munsey. “He passed four
guys on hills and was surrounded by
the opposition most of the race. He
will definitely be heard from in the
fuure.“ -

Captains Carlo Cherubino and
Chris Burns both looked very strong
taking second and third places.
Cherubino's time of 25:30 was the
22nd best ever run on the Albany
course and Munsey said that
Cherubino and Burns are “looking
better than ever.“

Boston State‘s Mark Duggin. a
two-mile N.C..A.A. steeplechase
champion. ﬁnished ﬁrst with the
twenty-first best time ever run here.
25:29.8. Cherubino and Burns got
second and third. but two Boston
runners came in ahead of Brian
Davis and Kevin Burnett to make
the score 25 for Boston Stateand 32
for Albany.

Munsey said he felt “kind ofproud
of tire guys. they‘re in the usual leg-
weary state front running hard in
practice but the next day they come
back with more springintheirstep."

Bring on Coast Guard

The team is looking forward to
Saturday‘s meet against the Coast
Guard where they will try to even
their record. According to Munsey
they plan to run a controlled race.

The ﬁve striking National Foot-
ball League teams agreed Thursday
to return to work and thus ended, at
least temporarily, the threat that this
weekend's lSreguldr-seasonopeners
would not be played.

The latest uproar to strike the
NFL was ended following a
marathon til-hour negotiating ses~
sion and a ﬁve-hour meeting with the
New England Patriots. Randy
Vataha. Patriots‘ player represen-
tative. emerged from a long session
Thursday in Foxboro. Mass.. to say
that federal mediator WJ. Usery Jr.
had convinced the club which started
the walkout to play this Sunday and
await a contract offer from manage-
ment on Monday.

The union revealed it had signed a
two-week no‘strike pledge with
management. but there remained a
threat from the Patriots that they
would strike again on Monday if
they don‘t like management's new
proposal. The other four striking
clubs »-thc New York Jets. New
York Giants. Washington Redskins
and Detroit Lions-——resumcd prac-
tice Thursday.

As the team readies for Saturday

"I can‘t say enough about the
quality performance Pepe Aguilar

The Albany Great Dane football
team survived a last minute scare
and went on to defeat the Alfred
Saxons l9-l3 Saturday at Alfred

Ranked number six in the nation.
the Danes have now won thirteen
games in a row. and go up against
number one Ithaca Saturday at l
pm.

The Danes scored first. and look~

ed as if they might blow the game
open easily. Alfred received the
opening kickoff. but the Albany
defense held tiglit.and the Danesob-

“We are ready to open our regular
season at Rl’l Saturday morning. at
10:30." said Albany State varsity
soccer coach iiill Schieffclin after his
llooters rtin their exhibition season
record to 6-1 by sweeping a
triangular with Ulster (Hi) and
Orange (3-0). Tuesday.

“i believe we are substantially
tthettd of where we were at when we
opened last year's dissappointing
campaign.“ Schiel'felin continued.
“Our defense is stronger than ever.
our offense has shown some im-
provement. and we've been
dominating play.“

The llooters' lone loss came Sutur-
dtiy versus St. Lawrence. by a 14)
score during the anttunl
Quadrangulur.

“We outsltot them ll-l." said
Schieffclin. “but just did not get a

break. lltcir goal was tint the best.

got burned.“

has a real tough personality and we
stiffened.“

The Danes came out fired up

opened the scoring by going 23 yards
for the score.

The next time the Danes had the
ball halfback Glen Sowaiskie turned
the corner on the left side and
rambled 40 yards fora touchdown.
The Danes missed the conversion
but had what seemed to be a safe
lead. l9-ll).

Alfred added a field goal early in
the fourth quarter and those two
missed conversions “began to grow
on us“. according to Ford. but
Albany seemed to be ill control of
things.

Then a funny thing happened.
Alfred was forced to puttt with less
than five minutes to play and it
appeared Albany would be ttble to
rtitt the clock out once it gairted
possession. .. Btitan Albany player
committed a clippirtg penalty before
the Danes hud possessionof the ball
so Alfred retained pos -ssion.

Once again the Dartes‘ defense
stiffened and the offense took over.
but Albany was ttiiable to mow the
ball and was forced to punt.
