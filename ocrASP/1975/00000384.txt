Pres Candidate Harris Advocates

Diffusion of Power in Government

by Ed Maser

Last Saturday Presidential can-
didate Fred Harris gavea speech in
downtown Albany‘s Channcy Hail.
In an attempt to raise support forltis
hid in next year‘s New York
Democratic primary campaign. the
‘Populist‘ former senator from
Oklahoma told some seventy
enthusiastic onlookers where he
thought Americashould beheading.

Harris said his candidacy is based
on two tnain principles; first. that
“people are smart enough to govern
themselves.“ Harris attacked
America‘s support for undemocratic
dictators and the resttlting loss of
respect for the U.S. abroad. “After
World War II everyone (in the
World) wanted to be like us. lt‘sjust
not like that anymore." He com-
pared the U.S. of today to Mettcr-
nich‘s nineteenth century Austria.
which supported the conservatch
world stattrs quo. and then he linked
abuse of power overseas to corrup—
tion at home: “ll' you fccl...you cart
do anything yott please about
national sccttrity outside your own
shares. then it becomes easy to do
the samc here in this country."

The candidate's second principle
calls for a “wid csprcad diffusion of
political and economic power."
Harris listed a number of concrete
economic measures he‘d support to
accomplish this goal'l'lreseinclude:

I) strict enforcement of anti-trust
laws.

2) “a graduated income tax. not
graduated tax loopholes.“

J) a further tax ctrt of someSlS
billion.

4) creation of a public corporation
("like the 'l'VA.“) to develop oil and
gas reserves.

5) a lirnitrrtiorr on the prodtrction
of cars to only those getting over
twenty mile per gallon of gas.

Most of these ideas, frtr frorn
radical. come out of precedents or
existing concepts. Harris admitted
as much when he said. “We need
only put into practice wlurt we say we
believe in.“

The former senator came down
hard on the idea that "sortie artist be
randomly unemployed so that prices
will fall." Instead of fighting infla-

tion by ltrying people off, said
Harris. a massive jobs program
should be started to provide work.

(Tire inflation resulting frornsuch an ,

increase in the work force. went
Hartis' arguman would be trflsatit
by competitively induced price cuts
caused by Harr'is‘enforccmcnt ofthe
anti-trust IaWs.) 'l'he Oklahoman
added that he believes much ol'Ncw
York City‘s current woes stem from
increased unemployment. which
means less city tax revenue (and
more welfare costs) at a time when
prices are skyrocketing.

Harris thinks that his unique
brand of populism willavoid George
McGovern's alienation in l972 ofthe
working class “Wallace people."
George Wallace and his followers
have no love for the present ad-
ministration. went Harris. for it is
they-who “are overtaxcd by govern—
tnent. laid offin large numbers...
got their boys killed in Vietnam.
“The Wallacitcs are shortcltangctl 0
their image.“ stated llarris. "'l‘lrt-y‘rc
called rascist antl jingoist. although
it is the ruling elite who are really
(like that)..."

Fielding questions truth the
audiencc. Harris humournusly pttt
down sortie so~called myths of
American politics. He termed as
“just so much talk.“ the image at the
Democratic Party tearing itself to
pieces every four years. “We (The
Democrats) haven't gone past the se-
cond ballot at a convention in thirty
years." He also joked about the
‘(ircat Mentioner.‘ Supposedly for
art unknown to be considered
seriously for the Presidency,
‘ncwspaper items must appear such
as 'l"rcd Harris has been prominent-
ly mentioned among the possible
utrtdidatcs for President next
year."

Fred Harris‘ political strategy
seems very much akin to that of
(ieorgc Mc(iovcrn‘s in I972. Fortltc
past few months he‘s toured the
country. speaking to youngish.
liberal audiences of the type who are
likely to volunteer to work actively

in grass-roots campaign,

organi/ations. Such people would be
invaluable in the innumerable
primaries which Harris plans to

enter.

One young ‘reformcr‘. after the
meeting had broken up. expressed
fears that upon his nomination.
Harris will leap. Mcf‘rgvaern-likc
towards the "political ccnter. hr-
terestingly. what Harris said about
the CIA may give backing to that
misgiving. “Dismantle it.“ said
Harris upon being questioned about
what he‘d do about the intelligence
agctrcy. That was quite a radical
sounding statement. which he fumed
ltoWever by suggesting that the
various functions of the CIA be
merely transferred to other areas
(“you might switch the electronic
surveillance to the Defense Depart-
ment". c.g.l. Thus llarris may be
suspected of sounding more liberal
than he actually is. perhaps in order
to attract that activist support we
mentioned above.

doberman If

by My Stein ‘

After a month of letter-writing.
fact-finding. telephoning and'
waiting. chemistry professor Jerald
Zuckerman is still in the dark as to
whether or not his grievance against
the SUNY Research Foundation is
being seriously considered.

Zuckcrman has raised several
questions about the legality ofa new
patent waivcrand relcaseform being
circulated by the Foundation. The
form was release at the beginning of
August and was described by its
creators as a simpler. less
bureaucratic version of past release
forms.

The Foundation. in order to in-
sure the protection of patent rights
for research sponsors. requires that
some sort of formal patent agree-
ment he signed by all individuals
working under grants within the
SUNY system.

But Zuckerman claims the new
agreement goes too far. lie says it

_thrcatens his academic freedom and

has been unsuccessfully seeking
clarification of certain significant
phrases in it for the past month.

“I‘m tired of this and I wish it
would go away,“ said Zuckcrman.
sitting in his office amongst a pile of
forms. letters and documents.
“Maybe they wish I would go away

. and think lwill." be continued.
referring to the Research Founda-
tion. “If they do, they‘re making a
mistake."

Zuckcrntan‘s grievance deals
mainly with the section that compels
all those who sign the form not to
“disclose any information
rclatingto. . .diseovcries or inven-
(ions to others. without the written
approval of tire Foundation." Ac-
cording to Zuckennan. this conflicts
with the SUNY lloard of Trustees
policy which guartrntccs
“unrestricted . . . dissemination

. of the conduct. progress. and

I I ver Research-Grievance
¥ On SUNY’S Patent 

  
   

One person whoico tin
Zuckerman's interpretation of the
agreement is Steven Ney. attorney
for the American Associationof Un7
ivcrsity Professors. He outlinesh'
own reading ofthe form inn letter
Zuckerman dated August 28.

According to Ney. “a plausible
reading ofthelanguagc. . . is that it
appears to require a faculty member
to refrain from disclosing to all~
‘others‘ any information relating toa
discovery unless he has notiﬁed the

. approval ofthe Research Faith-
dation." ,

Ncy suggests thata clariﬁcation be
made of the language in the agree-
them since. in its present form. it
“may constitute an infringement
upon protected areas of academic
conduct."

President Intervenes

President Fields intervened per-
sonally in the matter just hours
belorc Zuckerrnun was to ltave
presented a resolution condemning
the agreement til the first full faculty
meeting of the year on August 26.
Zttckerman agreed not to present the
resolution. with the understanding
that Fields would discuss the subject
with the SUNY Central Administra-
tion while he pursued the formal
grievance procedure otrtlincd by the

Foundation.

Since then. Zuckernran has been
trying to get a formal hearing with
Foundation4)irector Mort (irant.
In accordance with the grievance
guidelines. Zuckcrman wrotca letter
to (irant on August 29 requesting
this hearing. So far. (irant has not
responded. even though the
guidelines require that an answer be
given within five days.

“is he going to follow his own
procedure?“ asde Zuckerman. “id
like to know.“ Phone calls to Grant
were reicrrcd to his lawyer. who
could not he reached for comment.
