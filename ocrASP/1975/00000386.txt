Dr. Welly and hisstaff. He feelsthat
progress has been made but that
“more needs to bedone in thisarea.”
As far as the situation at the
Wellington is oonmmed (an exam-
ple of the results of overcrowding)
Dr. Welly is of the opinion that
“everything seernsto be going pretty
smoothly.” He has been down there
at least once a week since the
semester began. and he feels that

many ofthc problems, which wcrca

result of the short period of time in

which the Wellington and the un-

iversity had to prepare for the inﬂux

Other areas of interest for Dr.
Welty and his staffincludc spaking

handling more serious student
problem such as roommate eon-
llicts and other types of “crisis”
situations. In dling with such
problems, the residence staff

Illegal Research Paper f .
Sales Under Dispute}

by Doug HOI'Wlll
Among the rows of colorful
magazine advertisements that line
many classroom walls. SUNYA
students are finding Minute
Rt'l‘t'tll't'lt coupons thttt. with two
3 dollttrs.wittbuythcm

News the “latest catalog of
over 4.000 quality
Analysis research studies."

Minute Research of
Chicago. Illinois is only one ofmuny
nntionul outfits which together make
millions each year selling research
papers.

By law. Minute Research is
operating illegally on the SUNYA
campus. Section ZIJB of the State
Education law reads in part:

“No person shall sell or ol‘ferﬂtr
sale to any person enrolled in a un-
iversity. college. treat/wiry, schoo/or
other educational institution within
the state ol'Netv York any assistance
(with the exception of wpvrightcd
tt'orks) in theprepuruu'on, research
or writing ofa dissertation. thesis.
term paper. essay. report or other
written assignment intended/or rub-
ntt‘ssion to such educational institu-
tion in fulﬁllment of the re—
qtlll‘t‘mt’nlJ for a degree, diploma,
certificate or come ul'study.”

Violation of this law is considered
a class B misdemeanor punishable
by u maximum fine offch hundred
dollars and three months in jail. In
addition. anyone connected with the
advertising or salcolrcsearch papers
can be indicted on charges of con-
spiracy.

The state law. which was passed
.lttly t. 1972. explicitly buns the sale
of research papers but no mention is

made concerning the purchase of
such papers. Therefore. a student
may utilize the services of research
pupcr firms without fear of legal
retaliation. In fact. the l975-I976
Student Guidelines for SUNYA an-
ticipates that research papers might
be used as a source ofrefcrcnce. Sec-
tion 2 of the Student Guidelines
prohibits the "use of purchased
research service reports without ap-
propriate source notations.“ Thus._
according to the Student Guidelines
research papers are considered it
legitimate source of information as
would be true foruny library bookas
long as they are properly credited.
Even though the use ofpurchascd
research papers as a source is allow-
cd by the- University. faculty
members and students alike have
voiced their displeasure concerning
the issue. David Redding. a teacher
in the English Department. thinks
that using a purchased research
paper is "dishonest." Continuing
Redding said. “I deplore the process
particularly in courses with an
emphasis on writing  itdcfeats the
purpose of the course. The whole
thing is so damn self-defeating.“
Rich Pautz. a senior majoring in
English and Sociology. had similar
feelings. When asked ifhc would use
a purchased research paper as a
source Pautz replied. “Deﬁnitely
not. I like doing my own papers 
first of all it‘s honest.“ l’autz added
that if he were to use a purchased
paper he “Wouldn‘t leum anything
from it.“
English Department Chainnttn
Walter Knotts expressed much the
same sentiment. Knotts believesthat

  
 

 

 

  

   

   
  

 

 

 

   
  

by using it purchttscd research paper
a “student doesn't lea m n nything ex-
cept how to hike it. The point is thttt
in classes there is development of
research techniques."

Joseph Zttcck. History Depart-
ment Chairman. felt otherwise.
Although Zucck believes that using a
term paper is “not a healthy way to
gain an education“ he added. “I‘m
not sure thcrc‘sunything wrongwith
it. its long as it‘s one of many
sources.“ Some students who were
questioned also felt thttt purchased
research papers should be con-
sidered a legitimate source of infor-
mation.

Jeffrey Herman. another English
Department faculty member said
that if a student of his used it
purchased research paper tts‘n source
and footnoted it. he “probably
would n't consider it plagurism.“ Ber-
man added however. “I‘d want to
compare his paper to the bought
project.“ Herman thinks that
purchased papers are too high temp-
tation. “most people who use bought

projects exploit them.“

SA Execs Meet With Fields:
Mohawk Move 

by Daniel O’Connell

At last Wednesday‘s Central
Council meeting three top members
of the S.A.cxecutive branch voiced
various levels of disillusionment
with University President Emmett
Fields in reaction to I discuuion
held with himjust prior to the Coun-
cil‘s session.

The conversation with Fields
reportedly centered on the present
use of ports of Mohawk Tower for
faculty offices in the face of a critical
shortttge of oncatmpus housing. This
practice ttccording to S.A. l’rcsidcnl
Andy Bttumun. "is costing SUNYA
SUB.th out of our budget ettch
year" and setting back the Dor-
mitory Authority by an equal
amount. Supposedly this is because
students would have been charged
approximately twice as mttch for us-
ing that space than the present price
ttlg of the rooms as offices.

llnuman said he feared Fields was
"condescending towards students." a
notion which was reiterated by S.A.
Controller Stu Klien and Vice Presi-
dent Richnrd Meckler.

Specifically. Klien said that Fields
“didn‘t tnke students seriously“
while Mcckler was a little more
blunt.

A detailed account of the discus-
sion was given to the Council in an
executive session front which the
press was barred.

Dealing with other topics. the
Council passed a bill introduced by
Dave chrin (Commuter) and
Larry Schwartz (Indian) “strongly
rccotnmcnding“ the issuance of a
card to Wellington students giving
them priority on buses going to the

Hotel. Also pttsscd wasa hillputting
the office of student member of the
University Council on the ballot for
mun‘nuurl on page .\‘l.\'
