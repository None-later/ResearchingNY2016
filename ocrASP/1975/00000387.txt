acrimonious debate. reversed the

Nevertheless. ambivalent a"-
titudes towards the Wellington
students continue to cloud the pic-
ture. 'lhe Wellington Hotel isowned
by the City 01 Albany. which also
pays the RAs who staflthe building.

refuses to comtdcr the hotel a dorm.

and money it would otherwise

receive.

In part because of that. the Cen-
tral Council earlier this year
allocated 51.000 to the Wellington
for social activities. and Co) nt: ad-
milstheCouncilwas”discriminating
between the Wellington and other
commuters" by that act. Both the
(‘ouncil and the University ad-
ministration hatc spent money on
bus service toand from the hotel. set:
ting it further apart.

The status of Wellington students
is likely to remain in limbo for some
time. An unwanted child brought on
by the housing crunch. it is not likely
to become a permanent 'arrange-
ment. But. for students housed there
this fall. here is little consolation.

Wellington students cannot help
but be aware of the appeal by their
slate. There are ten posters
(including one on the ceiling) up in
the one four by ﬁve elevator that
students ride up in. There are posters
in the stairwells. more in the COP
riders. and there will be leaflets un-
der each door before the elections
are over.

A random survcy of hotel-
dwellers supports Minsky’s conten-
tion that the Wellingtontumoutwill

be large. And. without exception.
those surveyed said they‘d vote a
straight ticket for a slate that says it
will devote itself to their particular
needs.

University regards as central prin-
ciples. So fur the city's Board of
Higher Education has resisted state
and municipal pressure to cutdown
on the number of new students and
impose tuition at a rate likely to
mulch the State University's 5650 to
$850 tinnuttl tuition. The Board‘s ac-
tion htts been supported by students
nnd fttculty glikc.

However. CUNY must now ub-
sorb a massive budget cut of $87
million. with it" udditionul cut rang-
ing from 532 to $64 million possible.
nccording to CUNY spokespersons.
Though the open ttdmission and free
tuition policies have sutyivcd so far.
L‘UNY is pnying ll crippling pricc.

expenses. But some of thc 225.000

On another. the cutecr placement

students. Their tuition will jump
from $45 to $75 per credit. "Com-
pulsory fees. which everyone pays.
will be raised by 50%. Camputjohr

students into the city‘s already
shrunken job market.
Complicating CUNY's predict»-

ment is the mulching fund system by i

which the University receives a
dollttr from the suite for every dollur
of city funding for four yeur arm'-
puses. The less money the city can
give to the University.the less money
the state gives. So New York City's
linuncinl crisis dries up an outside
source of University funding aswell.

The principle of ljrcc tuition has
been defended by CUNY Chancellor
Robert Kibbcc llnd others who  it
offers at colicgc cductttion to those
lettst :lhic to afford it. About one
third of the student body. according
to Kibhec. come from families with
unnunl incomes of less than 57500.
