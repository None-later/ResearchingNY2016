' Concern-o

To the Idler:

In recent months the idea of “university
community responsibility" has been a recurr-
ing theme in university affairs. The students of
this school have accepted this concept in the
past as a necessary facet of university life. It is
now time to re-assess that acceptance.

Three years ago. Mohawk Tower became
offices for the faculty. “The faculty are over-
crowded." cried the administration, “the
students as part of theiruniversity community
must give it up for dorm use.“ At the time
fewer students wanted to live on campus, and
the move seemed to be a wise one.

Now the situation is more complex. The
rent on my converted four bedroom apart-
ment is going to go to $340 a month plus
utilities. Students are living in a dilapidated
hotel downtown, if they were lucky enough to
find that. The community can no longer hold
the student population. nor do they even want
them (i.e. new housing ordinances) Where is
the community. responsibility on this campus?
The administration and faculty must makethe
same massive effort to relocate office space
that student affairs made to ﬁnd housing.
There must be adequate living conditions for
students if our education is to be effective for
now. Mohawk must be returned as dorms.

It would appear that while constituent
groups are present on the campus (faculty. ad-
ministration. students, alumni) the concept.
of working together is merely a myth. For
through it all this university was built to
provide students an education. and when we
fail in that .responsibility it is only the student
who loses.

Israeli Truth?

To the Editor:

Concerning the lead item in “International
Reporting" in the September 9 issue of the
A SP. it‘s very clear that Mr. Eric Rouleau of
LeMonde is very‘ misinformed on Middle
Eastern affairs. There are several points that
need corrections.

From the very first paragraph. when Mr.
Rouleau charges that it is especially Jews of
eastern European origin who are the under-
privileged and that they havc'been striking,
demonstrating and rioting. it is quite clear that
he hasn‘t the faintest idea of what constitutes
Israeli society.

» Pan-.-

e ‘ 
yof Sephardic" ews) .v

‘- demonstrations occurred over threeyea‘rs ago

and since then the Israeli government has in-

- stituted a varietyof programs to meet and deal

with the problems of the Sephardic communi-
ty. Prominent among these programs is the
neighborhood} community center _where
residents of that neighborhood, in addition to
recreational facilities. are provided with social
services such as day-care. courses for young
mothers in child-rearing. tutorial help. study
'facilities. libraries. cultural programming and
many other services depending on the needs of
the neighborhood residents. When Mr. Rou-
leau speaks of “strikes. demonstrations. and
rioting" he is overstating a situation which oc-
curred over three years ago.

l was in Israel this past summer and saw
those community centers. I also spoke with
both Ashkenazic and Sephardic Israelis. and I
wish to emphasize to all that despite problems
such as inﬂation and high allocations for
defense, the Israeli people are asdetermined as
ever to preserve their land and live ina Jewish
country with their own self-determination.
The high inflation that has hit_lsrael is a result
of growing pains. Don‘t lose sight of the fact
that Israel is only 27 years old and despite the
fact that Israel has had a miraculous growth
rate. problems such as inflation are bound to
accompany it. Roulea u forgetsthut inflation is
a world-wide (France included) problem.

Rouleau mentions “political prisoners“ in
Gaza. I assume that Roulcau. through his
twisted lcftest thinking. believes the Gala
Arabs are “politiatl prisoners“ of Israel. But
are they really? These are the people who left
their homes after their “leaders” told them to
leave until the Israelis were wiped out and then
they could return. in short time. to their

homes. When the Arabs did not succeed in

“pushing the Jews into the sea" squalid camps
were set up by the Arabs. Meanwhile. Israel
was absorbing over 700.000 Jews who had
been expelled by the Arab governments of
Iraq. Iran. Egypt. Syria and Morocco and in-
tergrated them into Israeli society. No such ef-
fort wus made by Arab governments for those
people who left Israel because of their own
propaganda. Rather. they have been used by
Arab governments-as “political prisoners" or
rather “pawns” in sowing propaganda and
hatred towards Israel.

I'm happy to hear that the Palestinian
Arabs are finally realizing that the Jewish
State of Israel is hereto stay and now are look-
ing forward of a “compromise settlement.“
This could have occurred 27 years ago by
accepting partition. It's unfortunate that so
much blood shed had to be spilled and
bitterness developed before common sense
prevailed.

Liberation to‘Feminism:

A Conscious Effort

by Ellen Deutsehman
and Dianne Plehe
Remember this famous song of the mid-
sixties?
Where have all the young girls gone?
They've token husbands everyone .. .
When will they ever learn?
Now people can ask:
Where have all those ‘libbcrs‘ gone?
'I'hcy've gone to graveyards everyone!
Women's Liberation is dead! Along with
. Jimmy Hoffa. Jimi Hendrix. and maybe
Howard Hughes. Women‘s Lib has kicked the
bucket. Do you remember the last time you
could pick up a popular magazine or a Hearst
paper and see flashy storiesand picturesabout
those fanatical women‘s Iibbers who were
ﬂying in the air with their broomsticks
between their legs and feeling so free and
female because their legs were all hairy. their
faces unpainted. and their tits so loosely
unconstrained?

Well folks. it‘s become much more than
that. While you were laughing. most women
were crying. And now our tears have iced into
anger that is at the base ofourmovement. The
SUNYA Women‘s Liberation Group is now
the Feminist Alliance. a name which carriesa
completely different connotation. Now
"liberation" for most of us means struggle. and
in order to struggle we must rise above the
media images that try to have people laugh us
off.

"Feminists" have a certain frightening
power that “women's libbers" never did or
ever will have. We have the will and strength to
stand up to the overwhelming sexism that
pervades our campus. and we have enough
guts to do something about it. The Feminist
Alliance is creating an on-campus faction of
the AWARE (Albany Women Against Rape)
group. and they are continuing their
newsletter. Athena. One of the major long-
term goals that the feminists on this campus
have is to create solidarity among all warden—-
our sisters. In attemptingto reach this goal we
are forming consciousness raising groups
Within the Feminist Alliance and even in some
dormitories on campus. These CR groups are
vital for arousing awareness'in all women.
And now we have it little story to tell . . .

Melissa lives in one of the dorms at
SUNYA. One day she saw a sign on the
bulletin board asking women in the dorm to
cull Jean about forming a consciousness
raising group. Melissa decided to try to get
involved since nothing on campus interested

 

she could get together with other women to
hear what they had to say.
The first meeting was the next night and
Melissa decided to attend. When she walked
‘ into the room she heard somegirl complaining
about the men on campus:
' "They treat us like children, incapable of
participating in sports with them. not
' intelligent enough to become doctors or
lawyers, and they ridicule us when we make
political comments about the government."
Another girl spoke up. saying. 'We‘re not
‘true women' until we‘ve had our first but and

always have to be bound to a man to be
considered as a real woman or an adult!"

Someone else said. "My boyfriend heard
about these meetings and told methat iflwcnt
he‘d never speak to me again. I told him to
fuck himself! I don't need a guy to direct my
education. His problem is that hedoesn‘t want
my mind to expand.doesn‘t want me to think
for myself. if that‘s the way some guys are
going to be. let them go pick up some 'dumh
broad‘ and leave us alone."

“But wait!" someone said. “You as a woman
have to respect all other women even if they
irritate you by flirting with every guy they
meet. If we go around culling other women
‘dumb broads‘. then the guys we know will
figure it‘s all right to use that term to slant
other women. We have to be careful and very
considerate of other women if we want that
consideration and respect for ourselves. All
women have a common bond. and we should
always remember that."

Finally Melissa spoke up. “You‘re all
confusing me to no end by your comments
Don't you like your boyfriends? I think men
are great. and we should respect them. We
have to prepare ourselves to live in a world
with men so they will appreciate us. I try to be
understanding of my boyfriend because I
don‘t want him to ‘brcak up‘ with me. Jesus, I
take the pill because I don't want Stuart to
have In 80 through the messand expense ofan
abortion with me. Can‘t you understand the
feeling of men?"

Jean vehemently broke in with. “You sure
have a lot to learn! These sessionsare directed
especially at women like you. Don‘t you
consider your own feelings if you get
pregnant? You're the one who would have to
go through all the messy shitl Do you even
know if your boyfriend would help you out
with the money. let alone the emotionally
painful experience in the hospital? You have
to stand up and be your own woman. You‘re
not a piece of'meut that's bought and sold in
the market. I‘m not telling you to reject men.
but how can you forgive them for not
understanding you? You end up having to do
the understanding forboth ofyou. Stand up to
the facts. Melissa. Being u ‘liberatcd woman‘
just doesn‘t make sense anymore. You have to
be aware of what‘s happening in our culture
and help to change what's socially acceptable
because it‘s damaging to Women. Don't let
them fake you out. If you figure out what‘s
behind the whole processofsocializution, it‘su
reul ‘trip‘. Don't expect so much of everyone
else. You have to leurn to do things for
yourself."

And that's exactly it. The women's
movement is now at u point where. as Jean put
it. women haVe got round are doingthings for
themselves because we realize there‘s no one
out there to do them for us.

Instead of a feminist movement built
around the insigniﬁcant things the media
plays upon. we are building and reinforcing
our strength, moving in all directionsmthut
means politics. the arts. media. sexuality. jobs
and careers-03 Women and for women.

Is Bussing the Answer?

For all its good points, the New York Times
occasionally finds ilsclf following an unswcr-
ving political ideology when it should show
some moderation.

In an editorial on September l2 entitled
“Obeying the Luw“thcy stated. “It is possible
to hope dcspitc remaining problems that
Boston and Louisville are now on. their
way...us pluceswhcrc the initially hittcr pills of
court—ordered busing and desegregation huvc
ultimately bccumc accepted as ordinary
elements of daily life.“

How can busing ever become an “ordinary
element of daily life" when it is inherently so
disruptive. involving as it docs pulling
children out of their neighborhoods anti l‘or-
Cing them to go to some lo rcign pu rt of town to
receive an education?

Let‘s remember one thing -cductttion is still
the primary issue and concern. That is why
busing wu: sturtcd in the first plucc. Under-
privilcgcd students.prirmtrilyblucks. were not
getting educational opportunities equal to
those of thc predominnntly white sector.
'l‘hcrcforc. why not bus thosc in run-down, old
inner city facilities to the better. outlying
fncilitcs'!

While that sounds all fillt'tlntl well. the child
involved both loscsn sense ofidcnlity with his
own neighborhood or community and
simultaneously gums feelings of jealousy
llIid/Ol‘ inferiority towards the new school in
which he is placed.

If improving education is the real gonl.
wouldn‘t it: be better off taking the money
used for’iltjoth busing and the police and
Nuliomtl'Ciuurd to oversee the process. and
putting it towards improving disodvuntngcd
schools? This way. u bcttcrctlucution could be
achieved while allowing the child. while or
black. to muintuin a feeling of belonging to the
neighborhood he lives in.

It would be myopic to any that the only
rutionule.behind busing was strictly for thc
idcttl of equalized opportunities. The other

interest in rucittl integration. or equalized
numbers. This also soundsgood in theory. but
to some extent it points up ourpussion for set:-
ing society as groups of numbers rather than
being made up ofindividuuls. lfwc saw society
as being composed of individuuls. we would
see the black in the underprivileged schoolus
equal to the white in the more advantaged
school. And the some amount ofmoncy would
bc spent on each child;nol because one child is
black or one is white. but because of the fact
that they are all children seeking it proper
education.

Is everything stutcd thus fur a euphemism
for u doctrine of “scpumtc. but cquul"? No.
cvcrything stated thus for is related to prescr-
\'ntion of the neighborhood school. and that is
not necessarily at scgrcgutionist‘s euphemism
for maintaining racist policies.

The advantage of neighborhood schools is
lhttl it maintains a sense ol‘hclonging to it com-
munity.” children in the ncighborhood go to it
local school. parents will focus their concern
thcrc. It is the mic plncc. besides perhaps it
church. which attracts widespread community
involvement. From n sociological pcrspcctivc.
if children are busscd miles away for school. it
coltcsivc clcmcnt of u n individunl‘s communi-
ty will be destroyed.

Another uspccttu the neighborhth schools
concept is that it allows a child to maintain
pridc in himself without developing. its stated
bcfm'c. jealousy and hostility tqfvards others.

As long as busing is the llIW oflhc land by
court order. it shall have to be enforced
bccuusc of the simple fact that it is low. llusing
is only of superficial significance; superficial in
the sense Ihut it appears to be of good on the
surface while its more pervasive worth
remains in question.

 

 

Rush Register 0 V K

Three groups who in the past have competed jealously and questioned each other's
motives are now cooperating in a campaign to register youngiirtiters‘. ' '

NYPIRG (New York Public Interest Research Group). SASU (Student‘Association
of the State University) and various campus Student Associations including the one at
SUNYA are working to help voters register by early October. New York residentsover
18 who have not yet registered will not be able to vote in the ‘76printaries if they do not
register on October 4th or October 6th. These are the last days polling places will be
open for registration. '

NYPIRG is manning tables this week around campus where students can pick up a
publication on registration, absentee registration forms, and where they can ask
questions about the bureaucratic election law. ‘ '

The United States has a very low voter turnout compared to other democracies.
Considering its role in establishing democratic principles, the lack of citizen
participation in government is appalling. Very few students vote. and considering the
quality of leadership this country has had recently it is imperative that t ey stop
trusting those who do vote.

The primaries for the 1976 elections will determine the country‘s choice for thai
November. Every student who is of age should got to those NYPIRG tables. It’s a
responsibility.

Lobbying Saves

It is very fortunate for college students throughout the nation that Congress has been
able to override President Ford‘s veto ofthe $7.9 billion education appropriations bill.
It is only the second time this session that a Ford veto was not sustained. out of ten
which he has submitted. Some of the funds in the bill will be used this year to support
federal programs including. for example. work-study.

Thanks should go to hundreds of educational groups. including the SUNY-wide
student group SASU (Student Association of the State University for a. long and
effective lobbying job. The National Education Association and the American
Federation of Teachers mounted massive campaigns that caused the White House to
forgo an attempt to save the Ford veto. Whilethcbillwus politically popular. the heavy
lobbying wus csscnlinl to its passage in the present form.

For Serious Voters

Central Council. the legislative branch of Student Association. will be reaching its
full complement us it result of elections today. While other positions are at stake.
Councrl positions alone are open on every linng area and involve more candidates.

Council's power is economic. A half-million in student tax dollars are under their
control. Willlc most groups operate independently. decisions Council makes about
new grou s and occasional rccvultlutions of old ones has some measurable effect on
strident lti.

But few care. It is. indeed. abnormal for Americans to cnrcubout ourgovernment or
how it opcrutcs. Apparently. every interest group has some representativessomeWhere
crazy enough to waste their time working on that interest. When one advocate has
enough and quits another ﬁlls the place. So maybe there is no reason to care.

For serious voters. it should be noted that it is not clear what makes a good
Councilperson. since there have been too few models over the years to go by. It is
probably it bad idea to vote on issues; instead. if'through direct or indirect contact a
candidate seems to have good judgement and evokes in you a sense of trust. vote for
him.
