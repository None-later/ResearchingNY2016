Pro a junior and have been a resident of

State Quad for the past three years. One of my
reasons for remitting on the Quad was that i
felt it Was one .of the more mature, more
.responsible Quads. During the previous twu
years. destruction and vandalism on the Quad
was minimal enough to be tolerable.But lfind
the destruction on the Quad unbearable and
infuriating to the point where I feel lhave to
'write something that _I hope will help curb this
mounting abuse .

More times than not. living in the tower re-
quires long waits for the elevator. The bulletin
board across from the elevator provides
something to browse over while waiting in
boredom for the elevator to arrive. It is ap-
parent to any observer that much work goes
into making the board bearable to look at.
Already in these first three weeks of the
semester the board has been stripped three
times by some peabrained rowdies who then
delight in strewing the remains all over the
tower lobby. After each time. the tower staff
has conscienciously made repairs.

This purposeless destruction should be
enough to anger any student. but not only
have these high school mentalities deprived
tower residents of the bulletin board, they
have also managed to make the elevator waits
longer and. ‘on some occasions. eternal.

monumental feat was the removal of the three
pictures in the U-Loungewhieh had helped
brighten up the dreary area. Two of the pic-
tures were prt the wall. while the other
was cutout. lesying‘ls bare. Wooden skeleton.
This is the limit. Mindless; destruction of
somethingi’that beneﬁts the whole quad,
something that was enjoyable to look at as
well as probably being very valuable. being
destroyed for destruction’s sake is abhorrable
and intolerable.

What can be done? l'm sure that the normal
people of State Quad outnumber 'these im-
beciles overwhelmingly. With these odds.
therejs no reason why the residents of State
shouldn't be capable of stopping this asinine
vandalism.

What can we do? First. as students. we can
use the all-powerful weapon of peer pressure.
Let our fellow students know our disgust. Let
ourselves get angry and emotional and put on
a good display, especially on dinner lines and
in crowded lobbies. Perhaps a few remarks
will fall on the ears of the perpretrators.
Anyone with the mentality capable of this
kind of destruction should be easily suscepti-
ble to your peer pressure. This surely should
have some effect.

There is also another thing you can do. if
you witness the destruction - Telll Telll Tell!
Why should we let a few assholes victimize the
whole Quad? Use that dialing finger of yours
and call Security 457-7616 or the State Quad
Director on duty 457-788].

With only three weeks of the semester gone.
and destruction and vandalism mounting.
what prospects do State Quad residents have
for the future? It‘s up to you. Do something!

For a long time student have been living in
Albany/without leaming what went on around
them. Regardless of thereason for movingoff
campus. students seem to lose their awareness
of the surroundings once they do move off:
The University hasn't been much help in im-
proving the situation and the students are the
'ones to suffer.

p We‘d like to give all students, especially
ones living off campus. insight into the Albany
community. Where to get health services out-
side of the infirmary, when and how to use the
Small Claims Court, where to find a small
market that imports many European and
Australian‘beers- we‘ll try to cover these and
other topics. including foodstamps. legal aid.
entertainment. housing. and eateries.

While a column like this can cover many
subjects. it can't go into too much detail. There
is an organization that does go into great
detail on these topics and also offers a wide
variety of services to students. This group it-
callcd the Off Campus Association.

The Off Campus Association. headed by
codircctors- Andy Goldstein and Sandy Voit.
is undertaking manyprojects to aid the com-
muter. They're seeking to widen the buslineto
make it accessible to more students. obtain
lockers for commuter storage and make a stu—
dent population/dcnsity map supplemented
with a goods and services map.

Combined with the Office of Student Life.
DC A is sponsoring information sessions. The
purpose of these sessions is to bringin people
from community agencies who can answer
questions and give advice. The ﬁrst of these
sessions is this Wednesday. September 24. at
7:00 in the Waterbury Hall lounge. There will
be a representative of the foodstamps

I program. This is the chance to ﬁnd out if you

can save money by qualifying for assistance.
Planned Parenthood. legal aid. medicaid are
among the groups scheduled for future
senions. I ‘

OCA is correlating information for an ASP
insert. These inserts will hopefully ‘cover the
subjects we've mentioned and more.They can
be puttogether to fonnan off campus manual.
The OCA ofﬁce is located off the pinball room
next to check cashing. (The pinball machines
are scheduled to be moved above the cafeteria
and their former home is to become a lounge
where OCA will hang its information board.)

The Office of Student Life.also out to help
off campus brethren. is printing a monthly
bulletin called the Off Campus Community
Newsletter to be distributed the third week of
every month. The newsletter will be detailing
movies, speakers. concerts and other off cam-
pus events in calendar form. There will also be
section dedicated to specific items (ﬁrst issue
covers the Albany area thrift bakeries).

We feel it is important for students to know
what is being done for them. Much of what
we'll write about is geared towards the com-
muter but that doesn‘t mean that on compus
people can't take advantage of the informa-
tion. Until now. no full scale program has cx-
isted to deal with life off campus. Ap-
proximately 50% of the total enrollemnt of
full-time students live off campus. Problems
that affect a major part of the University can
no longer be overlooked.

We hope we've added to old interests and
sparked new ones. if you would like to work
with the Off Campus Association. please call
Andy Goldstcin (434-4878) or drop by the
OCA office.

‘ Palace Theater . . -
' Double Feature

by Betty Stein
A torn ticket stub:
Melissa
Manchester
8L Special Guest
Orleans
Palace Theatre
That‘s how the billing went. but last Thursday
night‘s show was enough to make anyone
suspect misprint.

Melissa Manchester grabs the audience.

Orleans. with their own custom blend of
ballads. blues. rock and reggae. pulled the
audience onto their feet twice that night. Then
on came Manchester like a cotton candy
dream doll. sweet and strong.dancing.
delighting and delivering what everyone
wanted to hear. '

Maybe a combination like this should con-
sider splitting. Competition can kill - but then
again. it doesn‘t have to.

Manchester grabs her audience. She knows
how to control a mass of people who already

like her inthe ﬁrst place. Now admittedly. that ~

doesn‘t sound too difficult. but not everyone
can do it with the same hardsofl. sweetseduc-
tive expertise that Manchester can.

A full house might intimidate some people.
but Manchester. either because she couldn't
see for the spotlights. or because she knows
her trade (I suspect the latter). kept the
audience in her grip. There were a few uncom-
fortable moments whcrl she seemed to be try-
ing a little too hard. shaking her hands and
kicking up her heels just a bit
overcnthusitlslically. but it was a forgiving
crowd - all was forgotten.

Eycs rivctcd on hers - hers on them; deep.
raspy nlking voicc - strong. emotional sing-
ing: rousing rcvivtll song - sticky. sweetscn-
timental melody. She led them where she
wanted. and they followed.

“it‘s lhc old ones. they‘re just like good old
friends.“ she said drcalnily. introducing a
song. and everyone got nostalgic withhcr. She
took n sent at the grand piano and sang “Call
me easy." She knew the crowd Would melt.
and they did. “I‘m a sucker for happy en-
dings.“ she walled. and they believed her. The

Orleans established themselves as close am" with the audience.

introduction to “Midnight Blue“ brought that
comforting wave of applause. that sigh of
recognition. and she was satisfied.

“Then you mean like they both really know
what the audience is into. You know‘.’ Like
Melissa and ()rlcnns can both relate with the
audience."

Close. but not quite.

From the first chord. Orleans established
themselves nsollics. friends to hctrustcd. Lead
guitarist .lohn Hall will probably go down in
history as the only person ever correctly
quoted as saying. "This is the ﬁrst time we‘ve
playcd in Albany. and it‘s about time . . . You
people are outta sight.” well it works for
Jackie Gleason.

lint a hand that doesn't try to make dry. wit-
ty statements about Albany can't be all had. A
band that can overlook ccnnin Albanian
idiosynchrtlsics - a bearded young man with
red shirt and faded gold vest danced earnestly

at backstage left. occasionally pausing towave
at his friends: one misguided soul lit a match at
the end of the set and held the ﬂame up high
(very moving) - must be a band that draw in-
ncr strength from some unknown source.
Tunes like “'l‘ongue-ticd“ and “Please Be
'l'hcre."‘hoth from their first album. showed
off the on-tllrget harmonies that have become
it sort of trademark for them. The title cut
from theirlatestalbum.“LetThele Be Music."
gave John Hall and tarry Hoppen. both
seasoned studio musician's, achance to display
their more-than-respectable talents on guitar.
Unfortunately. familiarity can become
riltnllism. Such was the case with their new
lop-40 hit. “Dance With Me.“ Described by
"llll as "one of those little records you can buy
with the big llolc.“it was the low point of their
performance. Harmonics tcctcrcd and ex-
press-ions blanked. but luckily AM songs tend
to be short. and this one was no exception.
