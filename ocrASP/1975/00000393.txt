Gymnastics. unlike most team
sports. is geared towards the in-
dividqu as well as the team as a
whole. According to Cobane. a
member has the challenge and

satisfaction of individual competi- I

lion and also the security thata team
sport has to offer.

“They spot each other and assist
each other which gives the girls a
great deal of team feeling,“ said
Cobane.’“You also see your own im-
provement much more than in any
other team sport."

For a very fast and deadly shoot-

ing method, set up the ball with
the shooter in backswing position. Then,
by positioning the ball along the foot of
the shooter as shown, you can ﬁre in any
direction with only one wrist movement.

® Pass back occasionally and shoot
quickly from the middle line. This
surprises your opponent(s) and makes
more of the goal visible.

© Practice bank shots from the mid-
die and halfback positions using
the shooting method described in # 1. This

is an unbelievably

The Albany State junior varsity

soccer team evened its record at H
With a 3-l win over ‘R Pl Friday.

Steve Harwook put the Pups on
the scoreboard five minutes into the
contest. when he rammed home a
lead-feed from Raffi Dekassian. Six
minutes later. halfback Dan Austin
scored what proved to be the win-
ning goal off an Engineers fullback.

Doug Runkel‘s 25 yarder into the
upper right comer completed the
scoring mid-way through the period.
as the Pups outshot their hosts. I2-4.

“After building that lead we
played defense and held on to it."
said Coach Evan Congress. “Our
half hacks started playingadefensive
game. and their lone goal came on a
penalty-kick."

“We played better than we ever
have this year," Congress continued.
“Our fullbacks were outstanding.
and our halfbacks played verywell.“

Mark Dalton and Eric Jackson both

Coach Bob Munsey said he was
content with the team's perfor-
mance. “We expected to win so this
was really no surprise.“ said
Mutisey. “We tried to run a con-
trolled race and we did it. We had
two groups but there were only two
ofour guys inthe first. We were hop-
ing to get three. maybe four. in
there.“

Munscy praised co-captains
Cherubino and Bums who he felt
helped each other out and did their
jobs. ‘
“They were only pressed for the
first two miles,“ said Munsey. “and
from then on they just had to chuck
that Coast Guard man. which they
did.“

Munsey was also impressed by the
performance of Brian Davis. “Davis
looked terrible for two miles but
then he really got going and passed
Benman, who I thought wouldn‘t be
caught.“

One thing Munsey was concerned
with was the gap between the first
group (ﬁrst and second) and the se-
