Debate continues over SA‘s recent
proposal that Mohawk Tower be
converted from an office facility into
a dormitory. Administration of-
ficittls have raised questions concer-
ning the feasibility of such it move
and are now doing extensive
research into the mutter.

Part of the debate centers around
the deadline for re-allocation of the
$07,000 that accordingto SA Presi-
dent Andy Bnuman. would be freed
by the conversion of Mohawk from
an office to a dormitory facility.

David Coyne. Central Council
Chairperson. explained: “What
we‘re working on now is... how muclt
time we have before the decision has
to be made.

SA executives are concerned thut
the administration might ltlkC too
long reseurching the move. thereby
missing the deadline for bttdget
changes. If they itpprovc it later. the
conversion will have to wait until the

Bauman mentioned the possibility
of recommending to the State
Legislature that the 937.000 be cut
from the SUNYA budgetas an un-
necessary expense. using this threat
to quicker action by the administra-
tion. Such ll budget cut would force
the conversion of Mohawk Tower
into a domt.

Dean for Student Affairs Neil
llrown noted that the discussion has
already left campus (Vltl ASP and
Tower Tribune): “Many people in
state government httve uccess to the
information that there's tt question
being raised.“

Brown pointed out that more in-
formtttion is needed before tr deci-
sion to convert Mohawk is made. He
expressed concern thut SA is looking
at the Mohttwk Tower solution in
“splendid isolation" of other factors
influencing the housing problem.

would house. ‘

Also in questipn is the amount
Bauman indicated Would be added
to S'UN YA's budget. “I don't yet line
up with those numbers... I think I
spotted some weaknesses.“ Dean
Brown commented . adding: ‘fl'm not
saying he (Bauman) is wrong."

Another problem involved in the
decision to convert Mohawk to I
form is whether students actually
want ttnotheron-cttmpus facility. SA
executives seem to feel there is an im-
mediate need for such on-campus
housing. citing complaints of in:
convenience from students living at
the Wellington.

Housing Director John Welty
however noted that many students
httve expressed interest in rcmttining
iii the Wellington. and some uptown
students are asking to be pttt there
next semester.

Welty feels that. by the second
semester. ttnyone dissatisﬁed with
living at Wellington will be uble to
move uptown.

Dcttn Brown explained his at-
titttdc toward the problem:“l‘d feel

don‘t want to live there.“ One alter-
native he did suggest was pre-
fabricated housing ucross the street
from the campus.

Progress on tltc decision to con-
vert Mohawk is now dependent on
gathering the infonnution needed to
evaluate feasibility of the conver-
sion. Housing Director Welty will be
receiving it five-year projection of
cnrolltnent by next Week.und Presi—

dent Ficlds‘ is to be briefed todin by
Dean Brown and John Hartley. Vice
President of Managementand Plan-
ning. «

Dean Brown indicated that. until
the administration receiveslwhat it
considers sufﬁcient information. it
will not make a decision on the
Mohttwk tower conversion. When
thut time comes. President Fields ‘
will have final say in the matter.

CUNY Students Protest Tuition

by Sue Emerson

(iovcrnor Corey will not call it
special session of the legislature in
order to review the City University
of new York‘s (CUNY) request that
the state give the university at” the
money which it was originally
tilloutted under the mulching funds
formulu. according to Carey‘s Depu-
tyl’ressSecretziry llowa rd Clttrk. says
Clark. “We cannot. without further
endangering sttttc finances. cull it
specittl session for City university.“

lly law. the state is required to
mtttch operating expenses with the
four-your CUNY institutions dollar
for dollar. Two-year CU NY in-
stitutions receive mulching suite
funds tottiling‘ill‘ynoftheir operating
expert. s.) In response to massive
city cutbacks in C UNY's bridged. the
state has reduced its allocations llC-
cordingly.

ClJNY'S fuculty. students. and
administration tll‘c calling on the
suite to restore t hcsc funds. at student
and litcully sponsored rally held
September It) in front of the gover-
nor's New York office drew to ex-
tituttted 1.000 to 6.000 people. Since
the existing lth would have to be
clutngcd in order to pcrtuit the state
to provide more than dollar-for-
dollttr matching funds. City Univer-
sity Student Scuttle spokesperson
Richard Rothhurd admits that one
of the purposes of last week's rully
was to convince Governor Ctt rey “to

put the fttll weight of his office
behind it tnovc to have some type of
emergency or perhaps long-range
legislation enacted.“ Rothburd feels
that the rally was successful in aler-
ting Carey to CUNY's fisz dilem-
mtt.

But according to Deputy Press
Secretary Clark. “We have said that
we can really do no more for New
York City." And he adds that “the
city hits to decide for itself.‘ how to
handle these problems.

One way of handling its shortage
of funds would be for CUNY to
accept Commissioner Nyquist‘s re-
cent proposal that the City Universi-
ty of New York begin to churgc tui-
tion. tlll alternative which the univer-
sity hats lltuly rejected to this date.

According to Deputy Com-
missioner of Education Dr.
Hollander. charging tuition seems to
be the least "painful" alternative
ttvniluble to CUNY if it wishes to
maintain open ttcccss‘ to students and
fl program of reasonable quality.
Reiteratng Nyquist‘s claim that
those students whoeonnot ttffordto
pay tttition would probably be eligi-
hlc for various forms of financial
assistance such as the Tuition
Assistance Program (TAP) rtndor
the Federal lktsic Opportunity
(irttnts. Hollander wcntontosuy that
having those students who can tif-
ford to pity tuition do so “seems to be
ll morul thing to do." According to

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Hollander. the next move in regards
to Nyquist‘s proposal rests with the
C ity‘s Board of Higher Education.

Board chuirmun Alfred A. Gior-
dino replied to Nyquist‘s proposalin
it letter dated September 17. “Per-
sonttlly." Giurdino stated. "I do not
share your suggestion that the prin-
ciple of free tuition should lightly be
cast aside at it time_ofstrcss without a
careful review of all other remedies
to meet the current fiscal problems."
(iittrdino concludes that “the most
appropriate and equitable alter-
native open to the university is
receipt of the monies from the static
ttlrctldy appropriated.“

According to Mr. Abertlt. Ex-
ecutive Assistant to the Board of
Higher Education. uThe Board is not
going to institute tuition. Hopefully,
we‘re going to try to get funding by
the state."

City University Student Senate
Chairperson .lay Hershenson con-
firmed tliut representatives of his
group have been meeting with per-
sons in the governor‘s office.
Hershcnson indicated that the
governor's office has been sym-
pathetic but noncommital. “They
didn't say yes. and they didn‘t no.
and they didn‘t say maybe.“ he
remarked. Members ofthe Universi-
ty Student Senate are preparing to
meet with Commissioner Nyquist
some time next week. “I want to ex-
pose alot of the myths they have
created in terms of tuition."
Hershenson said. An emergency
meeting ofthe Senate has been called
for Sunday in part to beginrlac-
tivating the machinery for u
university-wide strike should one
seem necessary. -

Hershcnson wishes to cmphasiu
that the university is not asking for
additional money but for money
which has already been allocated by
the state. He does not feel that the
state should lose itspbligotion to the
city just because the city in in a ﬁnest
crisis. “We’re talking about literally
tt catast rophc." llershertson said told
in summing up the problem.
