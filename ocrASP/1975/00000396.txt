FutilEiunination Policy. This meeting also failures! excellent attendance
whi is rare‘for the University Senate.

 Fields addressed himself to the State of the Senate. Comparing himself
to systems engineer. Fields compared the Senate to machine with a low rate
of efﬁciency. He attributed this in part to the Senate‘slimited powers and the
lowlpriority that Senate meetings and business have in the minds of some
Senators. ﬁelds does not feeL however, that the Senate is useless or beyond
repair. He made the following'suggestions as to ways lhat the Senate could
increase its efﬁciency.

Dr. Fields recommended that less time nc- nt discussing the senate
itself. He also felt that greater respect for of councils would cut
down on duplication of effort. Dr. Fields asserted that in discussion of items
such as the meaning ofa liberal arts degree. the Senate was over rmching its
jurisdiction. His statement that such things should beleft to the facultyofthe
College of And and Sciences. is interesting in light of the shadow of doubt
Fields" decision not to appoint a Dean of Arts and Sciences has placed the
future of that college.

President Fields suggested that the Senate consider setting tip a council to
decide on issues of minor importance. The council “uuit; he l'.’ ponsiblc in
the Senate and if it ruled on any issues the Senate as a whole felt it cf: of major
importance the Senate could overrule the council.

Fields then stated what he felt to be his obligations to the .>.nalc. He said
that he felt that he must be candid with the Senate and expressed the hope
that he and the Senate never ﬁnd cause to disagree. However in case of
disagreetmnt Fields said that he would promptly report to the Senate the
reasons for his disagreements. Dr. Fields ﬁnal proposal was that the Senate
formulate some sort of rctrench mcnt policy so that the atllioc nature of this

summer's decisions need not be repeated.

The fin ision of Undergraduate Final Examination Policy (Bill l97475-08)
was ﬁrst introduced by the Undergraduate Academic Council in February
l975. Action on it last scmestcrwasdclayed byextcnsivedebuteand lack ofa
quorum. Its major points provide that ﬁnal exams be restricted to that week
at the end of each semester set aside for that purpose. that tests in the last
week of classes he announced well in advance and that two reading days be
taken out ofthc ﬁfteenth weck ofclass. The Bill would still allow for spectal
treatment of individuul(cmphasis in the originallcases. After some debate on
more or less minor issues the bill passed wsily. It will now be referred to
President Fields and ifhe approves it will go into effect as soon as possible
but no later than Fall term I976".

BLACK MARKET

The'New York Times teportsthttt
the nation‘s newest crime wave can
be found not in the streets. butdown
on the farm. '

The Times reports that the
pesticide shortage of last year has
created a serious black market in

' pesticides. Pesticides. herbicides and

insecticides. thenewspaper says, are
being stolen in record quantities and
bootlegged for two or three times
their retail prices.

Investigators looking into the
theft rings say that the chemicals.
which are used in growing cotton.
soybeans. corn and other products
have become almost as valuable as
precious metals and much easier to
steal.

Investigators say that a thief can
walk into a barn and walk out witha
five gallon (an of the pesticide
Trcflan in each hand. With just this
haul. the Times says. a thief can

collect as much as $ I 25 on the black
murkct for it.

The Timur says that the pesticide
shortage has utuscd some farmers
laced with losing thicr crops to pay
any price. Somc Mississippi Delta
farmers. the newspaper says. report
paying as much as $l75 for it ﬁve
gallon can of 'l‘rcﬁan during last
year‘s shortage. Before the pesticide

The newspaper says that a grand .

vestigating the activities of some of"

the Miésiiisippi Delta's most promi-
nent families for the possible traf-
ﬁcking of stolen pesticides.
According to investigators work-
ing on the case. there is a strong in-
dication that indictments against
members ofthese fa miliesand others
are imminent. the Times reports.

WINE AND DINE

People who drink wine with their
meals may not only be giving their
taste buds a treat. but their whole
body as well.

According to a University of
California study. you get more food
value out of meals if you wash them
down with wine.

troduced a bill to reduce the so-

called “eoinmemorative legislation" '

She reports that commemorative

Schroeder has found that there
were 500 commemorative bills in the
92nd Congress; 600 of them in the
93rd Congress; and ISO in the first
two months of the 94th.

The Congresswoman calculates
that such bills cost taxpayers at least
$50.000 each session just to be
printed up—a figure that does not
include other costs. such as staff
