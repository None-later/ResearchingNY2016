. For the past several years. the
number of bicycle thefts on campus
has remained at a steady level of ap-‘
proximately 65 annually. However,
in the past two weeks, at least eight
bicycles have been stolen. Most of
these were appropriated from the
area around Draper Hall on the
Downtown Campus. For this
reason. Security has recommended
that the available bike racks in that
area be moved toamorevisiblesite.
The great majority of those bikes
stolen were of the newer European
and l0-speed variety. Unfortunately,
the recovery rate in these cases is ex-
tremely low for two reasons. One

reason behind the lack of recoveries '

is because most of these thefts are
performed by male high school
students from the surrounding com-
munity. After taking the bikes, they
are not usually seen again.The other

her bicycle with eeurity. This free
process consists of simply coin?
pleting a data card with the oWner's
name; "address, Social Security
number and a description of the
bike. In return. the student's Social
Security number is engraved onto
the bicycle. This is done as a form of

‘ identification. since most people do

not remember their bicycle’s serial
number.

John 'Henighan of Security
believes that the number of arrests
made have increased.although exact
figures are unavailable. He at-
tributes this to both “being in the
right place at the right time” and in-
creased alertness on the part of
passers—by.

Lock Your Bike!

Despite the peak times for bike
thefts obviously being the warmer
months such as April, May and

Most .locked bikes on the
Academic Podium were chained to
the railing rather than the available
bike racks located near the library
and the Campus Center. The majori-
ty of students interviewed did not
have their bikes registered with
Security either. Some. including
those who have been students at
Albany State for several years.
professed to be completely ignorant
of the process. Students who felt that

unable themselves to ﬁnd other
solutions.

September. it is still recommended
that all bikes always be locked up
securely (preferably with stainless
steel, ultra-high security locks which

cause behind this adverse
phenomenont lies within the
students themselves.

f recdom. They believe that a person should be free to spend the fruit .of his/ her labor to his own
