Spirit of ’76

by Bill Castle

Spirit is back. after a two year
absence. with a new record company
and a new sound. Though much
more reserved than previousalbums.
thisalbutn docscontain Spirit‘s tnost
notable asset. originality.

Spirit of '76 also marks the return
of guitar playing. electronic wirard.
Randy California. who left Spirit
shortly after the release of their
TIt't‘lVl’ Drctttns of Doctor _Sar-
dtmit-ux album. Along with Randy
California are original Spirit
tncmbcr Ed Cassidy on dmms. and
newcomer Barry Keene on bass.
California. who had been converter!
to electric guitar by close friend Jimi
Hendrix returns to acoustic fora
large portion of this album.
Although Califomia often goes
overboard with his ttsc of electronic
gimmicks. as provcn on the cuts
“Jack Ilond“ and “Tampa Jam".his
sound effects do play an important
part in the rest of the album.

This album contains scvcntccn
original tuncs written mostly by
('alilornia. which arc. for the most
part. \cry good. The significance of
this album. though. is not the
originals but the remarkable ver-
sions of tuncs written by others.

Ihc high point ol'this album isan
cxccllcnt version of Dylan‘s “Likc a
Rolling Stone". The way Spirit
adapts this song is truly a work of
a rt. They add new life and power to a
tttnc which in its original fonn. is
already a classic. Spirit‘s version of
“The Star Spangled Iianncr" is cn«
joyahlc and almost as unbclievablc
as their version of Dylan‘s “The
limes lhcy Are a (‘hangin"intcr-
mixed with “America The
licautilul“.

Pink Floyd
Returns from
Dark Side of the Moon

by Matt Kaufman
Wish You Wae'Hm-Pinlt Floyd (CBS)

The hand isjustfantastic. that is really what I think. Oh. by the way. which
one is I'inki‘

llark. what album from yon Abbey Road Studios? Is it a new album by
Yoko ()no‘s pct ily'.’ No. Is it anew album by Ringo Starr. Yes. Yes? No. No!
It‘s not even the Masked Marauders, part II. Instead it‘s the masters of
cosmic rock. Pink Floyd. Who. you say?

Two years ago Pink Floyd released Dark Side of the Moon and their hit
singlc “Money”. Since that time. an eager public has been waiting for a new
album. and waiting. and waiting. and wai- Finally, by the start oftbis year.
Pink Floyd returned to the recording studios. and by June had enough
material for a tour and an album.

()n that tottr. the group opened their shows with three long songs from the
tltcn unrclcascd album: "Raving and Drooling". “Gotta Bc Crazy" and
“Shine On You ('rary Diamond". These three songs were received by mixed
reactions from tltc audience and music critics. 'lltcy were good. but if the
whole album was like these songs. success would be difficult.

Within the interval of time between those spring concerts and the album‘s
release. l’ink l‘loyd again rcturncd to.thc studio. There. they added tltc
linishing touches to \\ but could bcthcir most successful album. both musical-
ly and commercially. The album. entitled Wish You Were Here wcnt gold
almost instantaneously. with nine hundred thousand copies distributed by
the day ol rclcasc.

Not only does Wish '01: Were "t’rt' equal Dark Side of the Moon in

The album is cut so that each side is one continuous song. It represents a
synthesis of old Pink Floyd music. as on Utntnagummu.und the new Floyd
that starth with More and reached maturity on Dark Side of the Moon.

Thc oldcr I-‘loyd involved experimentation with echo and rcvcrb units.
producing so-callcd "spacey" sounds. The music was interesting. but tended
to get boring at times. When the group startcd to do movie soundtracks. their
songs became tnorc structured musically and more interesting lyrically. Un-
fortunately. the success of Dark Side oftht' Moon lay in the relative absence
of the spacey instrumentals.

Side two opens with what could become the group's next AM hit. Likr
“Money.” this song. ‘Have a Cigar." has a strange rhythm which defies thr
listener to tap his feet to it. '

The album is full of symbolism. from the lyrics and music to the cot/er and
record sleeve design. Both contain pictures on each side of the four nature?
elements: Earth. Air. Water. and Fire. ‘ ‘

Wish You Were Here is deﬁnitely the best Pink Floyd album todate. Th:
group has followed up a smash hit with a bigger one: the wait wa~
