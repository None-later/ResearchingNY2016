  angina Mun-i.

0f the Greek god Dionysus. also
known as Bacchus or, to the
Romans. as Liber. many people
know that he was the god of wine.
and some people know that he was
also the god of the theater. Actually
his function was far more com-
prehensivc: he represents and em-
bodies the fertility of humans.
animals. and plants. as well as the
unrestrained and destructive forces
of nature. In his train there were
satyrs and frenzied women; and the
former scent to have spent most of
their titne chasing the latter. or so it
would seem from numerous Greek
vase paintings.

The frenzied women in Dionysue’
train are called Maenads, which
means In rage. I() b('./'I‘t'll:l'£'ll. la b!
marl. ’l‘lte maenads‘ worship of the

performed here on October 3i) the

Raging macnads are a frequent
theme in Greek and Roman art. hnth
sculpture and painting. We know
from literary sources that in the
[north century li.('. the (ireck sculp<
tor Scopas created a ma rblc ligurc of
a maenad fiercely ragingand tearing

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

W
by Lon ‘Levln

To kick off a new season. Frank
Cannon (the detective known for his
girth played by William Conrad)and
Barnaby Jones (the detective known
for his age played by Buddy Ebsen)
teamed up to prevent a mat-
tinational corporation from seizing
control of the world‘s power
resources. The funny thing is. they
succeeded.

in between Cannon stufﬁng his
face and Jones taking his Geritol
they managed to prevent a takeover
that in “real” life the United States
couldn‘t thwart (assuming it did
want to). Maybethat says something
about Cannon and Jones? Maybe
that says something about the Un-
ited States government? Non-
etheless. when the ratings come out.
Cannon and Barlmhr Jones will
have a nice rating position.

The trick of having guest.

appearances of familiar T.V.
characters on other shows is a com-
mon one. Last year the ratings of
Rhoda went up every time Mary
Tyler Moore came to visit her friend
in “fun city“. Owen Marshall and
Marcus Welhy teamed upon one oe-
casion to increase their audience.
These show also tend to have the
highest budgets.

The reason for the la rgcraudiencc

tubal we feel we are getting “two for .

'the price of one”. But are we?"

Potentially. it wouldfb‘e enter-
taining to see the} interaction
between two familiarand interesting
characters. However. on T.V.. they
are rare. Most main protagonists
are. at the most, two dimensional.
The-end result usually remindsmeol'
the time I took two Colorform sets.
one was Popeye and the other was
M rs. Cooky‘s Kitchen. and put them
together.

Perhaps the networks should ex:
pand this idea of guest appearances
and conglomenttion shows. One ex-
citing show would have Hawaii Five-
O‘s Communist arch—villian Wo Fat
trying to sell books of Chairman
Mao‘s writings to John-Boy of the
lt’alronx. Joh n-Boy eventually
becomes a militant revolutionary
but gets caught when Mannix sees
him trying to convert a room full of
penny loafers to the Maoist persua-
sion. John-Boy is then brought to
Marcus Wclby who performs a
radical lobotomy on him. John-Boy
then runs for senator and wins.

Personally. i would like to see a
series in which Owen Marshall.
Anthony Pctrocelli. Perry Mason
and Kate McShane defend the
network‘staste and creativity.

Stay tuned next week.
