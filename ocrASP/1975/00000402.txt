Of course. cat lovers will dispute
this statement—for them Tonto is
the star of the movie; but if you don't
get your thrillst‘rom cats, the rest of
the cast is excellent,also. Besides Art

'Carney, the cast includes Ellen .

Burstyn as Shirley, Larry Hagman

as Eddie.- and Geraldine Fitzgerald V

as Josie. an old flame of Harry's.

And watch for Joshua Mostel '

(Zero‘s son) as Harry‘s freaky grand-
son. and Chief Dan George as the In-
dian in jail.

Mazursky, who produced,
directed. and co-authored (with Josh
Greenﬁeld) “Harry and Tonto." has
blended comedy and drama effec-
tively. The film has a certain warmth

and compassion, but doesn't get too
sentimental. Mazursky addresses the
problems older people have in our
society. although he makes his
character too robust and indepen-
dent to feel the helplessness many of
the aged do experience. What he
gives us instead is the story ofa man
who wants to enjoy life. no matter

Pei-forming tonight and
tomorrow ‘night at the
,‘Fre‘eze-Driedt Coffeehouse are
Deseret String Band. who
hail all the way from Salt Lake City,
Utah, doing -"old timey music".

The band plays early Western str-
ing music, traditional Irish tunes,
southern fiddle music. and early
bluegrass. bringng a style of music
seen only brieﬂy before at the
Coffeehouse during Buffalo Gals
bluegrass performance earlier this
semester. The ﬂavor of this music is
strongly tradional, marked hopeful-
ly by good musicianship on many
varied instruments.

Deseret
Jardine—ﬁddle. french harp. vocals;
Hal Cannon—concertina, man-
dolin. banjo-mando. guitar, pump
organ, vocals; Leonard Crimson-
banjo. bo-d rum. vocals; Skip
German-— ﬁddle. mandolin. guitar.
vocals; and Rich McClure-guitar
and dobro.

 

' is comprised of Mark.

Although "old. timey music“ has a
strong folloWing here in the Albany
area. Deseret‘s main following is in
Utah, and bordering areas. They
recently returned from atour of Eu-
rope. and have two albums cut,
“Utah Trail" and “Land 'of Milk and
Honey." They have performed as
warm-up group for Taj Mahal, Nitty
Gritty Dirt Band.yand Leo Kottke.
Again most of their playing has
been in the West Coast area. at the

San Diego Folk Festival,and Great
'American Weekend in Spokane.

On the whole. Deseret String
Band will provide some music this
weekend not common to many peo-
ple, and a l'avorite of some. it‘s
different. and lively. and a little
change from country and folk.
