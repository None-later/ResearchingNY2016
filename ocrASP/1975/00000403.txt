unnoticed

To the Most

Recently in Roswell, New Mexico, a
' reporter typed up the Declaration of In- '
dependence as a “petition”. She stopped [00
persons, out of which 36 signed- It was
recognized by only four peoplel ‘

The reporter was called a Communist and
told by two men that “documents such as this
called for tearing down our form of govern-‘
ment and would start riots and result in
protest meetings." One of them threatened to
call the police.

There is something terribly wrong with an
educational system thatbreeds so much con-
forntity to the status quo’and'produces people
who can't even abide the noble revolutionary
Declaration of Independence.

I was handing‘out Soc'IIist Labor Party
leaﬂets and a man‘insisted to methat Nelson
Rockefeller is a Socialist. What a joke!

This is to remind readers that the ofﬁcial

On the Tuesday, September 9 broadcast of
“All Things Considered” the British Home
Secretary was interviewed conceming the
current situation in Ireland. He made a
number of statements reflecting the British
political line, which were accepted and
presented by the American interviewer as be-
ing the objective truth. These political lies
must be corrected.

Sit Fein; its defense amt, the Irish
Republican Army; and its American support
organizatiot't', the Irish Republican Clubs of
the Unite. States and Canada, fully support
the cease-lire agreed to by the Ofﬁcial I.R.A.
in I972 and which exists to this day.

Burning the

Castle . . .

To the Editor:

lam writing this from the viewpoint of adis-
gusted female. I believe in freedom of the
press. but I do think that a college newspaper
should take into consideration the variety of
students reading it. I am referring to Ken
Wax's Castles Burning column. If Mr. Wax's
intent is to totally gross out the female popula-
tion at SU NYA then I must commend him on
ajob well done. However, ifCastles Burning is
supposed to be humorous then Ken has missed
the boat.

I have previously found Mr. Wax to be an
intelligent and funny person andlookcdfoward
to reading his column. Obviously the summer
sun affected him in a way that he can no longer
mix sex and humor tastefully.

I realize that he could respond to this by tell-
ing me not to read his column, but of course
this would be a ridiculous answer since I
couldn't possibly know how bad the column is
until I read it.

I would hope that Mr. Wax thinks about
this before writing his next column, because as
of now Castles Burning is deﬁnitely burnt!

Regarding last Friday's Castles Burning
column entitled “Same Sex". has the ASPever
considered having an abortion and freeing
themselves of one Ken Wax?

" Censure "P

To the Elites: v

At the .Septtanber l0 Council. meeting. I
brought up some food from the Rathskeller.
Having not eaten the entire day, [expected to
fully enjoy my cheeseburger, cheese doodles,
pretzel (which. incidentally. was' hot and
soft—quite a treat for an FSA pretzel) and one
beer. '
' But I was wrong. For, upon attacking my

supper, I was informed by Council Chairper- .

son Dave Coyne that I had an illegal stimulant
in the room. According to Bill 7475—ll3
“alcohol, and other depressants or stimulants
as well as contraband [is] prohibited in the
Central Cou'ncil chambers...”. Kind of
nebulous, yes? Does that include hot pants (a
stimulant), or textbooks (a depressant)?

The Chair then ordered me to remove my
beer. Now, I'm not an alcoholic, and I wasn't
drunk or rowdy. I was merely sipping a beer
with my dinner. For this heinous crime. Cen-
tral Council 'Wasled, almost an hour of
valuable time (about 20% of the meeting)
debating my censure. And censured I was.

Censure is a slap on the wrist—“naughty,
naughty, Jon" ——which means nothing in itself.
But it does indicate the Council’s priorities—
dissipating itself on restrictive, stupid rules
which are more repressive titan many of .the
school Administration's regulations.

During the following week‘s meeting, an of-

 

suy-Iﬂd . . . .
. kind enoudt to bring a healthy number of

pretzels and severel'pitehers of beer. Within

‘ ‘ d Council reps were
drinkingi _ . imately four feet
away from where I had been the Week before.-
In fact. many of those enjoying the beer‘had

.had more than _'I drank the previous week.

Well. I was understandably pissed off about
this hypocrisy. ’ ' '

Anyway, I had spotted two members com-

mitting no-no's. One was drinking coffee
(which contains caffeine. a stimulant) and
another was smoking a cigarette (and nicotine
is, as you know, a stimulant)—therefore I
moved to censure these two. Now, Idon’t real-
ly give a shit whether someone smokes or
drinks coffee at the meetings—but the fact
was, they had violated the letter of the
Iaw......they broke the same rule I had.
' . They had done so with the same amount of
malice (none), evil consequences (rione), and
inebriation (none) that I had. Nevertheless, 'I
felt that their censure might help show how
ridiculous the rule was. The result.....the mo-
tion to censure failed f or lack of ti second. Not
one other rep (including those who had drank
beer earlier on) felt that breaking the rule was
bad this week.

Selective enforcement? Bias? Inequality?
Yes.....but then. nobody's ever accused Coun-
cil of being consistant. Actually, they are, to
an amazing degree, consistently inconsistent.

The problem is that this group of people
control a half-million dollars of mandatory
student tax money. Off which each student
contributes (is forced to pay)“: bucksayear.

The light of democracy, right?

Bridging the Gap

A generation gap between the “not quite
30‘s" and the "just over 20's?" Nay, you reply;
yes. say I. The burden beneath which we could
not falter was to man and woman the ram-
parts. to wage the war of non-violence in the
streets, armed with naught but open hearts
and hands full of roses placing the stemmed
blossoms into the muzzles of the M-l6‘s.

Ironic. how a college generation conceived
and born at the end ofthc last great holocaust,
perhaps in the womb when Fermi’s sun burst
over Hiroshima, should tremble at the words
of the Bhagavad Gita:

I am became death,
the shutter of worlds;
waiting that hour that ripens to their
doom.

But it was real—oh so painfully real!

No sacriﬁce was too great. no tear-gassing
too caustic. no club too blunt to stem the
ﬂood-tide of conscience flowing onto the
sterile sands of battle. To be sure it was de

rigueur to some. but to many it was a spon- r

taneous AT-ONE-MENT for the sins of a
govemmcnt gone mad—an outpouring of
burning tears forourconscriptcd brother gone
to war—an apprehension that the house of
state dividing against itself was about to fall.

Downstairs

There has been much yelling and screaming
lately about secrecy in government. Most
recently this attack has focused on the C.l.A.
and the Army for the research that they con-
ducted with LSD and other hallucinogcns. It
has taken more than twenty years for this pur-
licular research to come to the public‘s atten-
tion. it is fortunate for thccontinucd existence
of the republic that people in increasingly
large numbers are finally making angry noises:
it is unfortunate that most people do no
recognize the underlying cause of this un-
tcnnblc government secrecy.

The problem lies with the inability of
politicians to see themselves for what they
really are: public servants. Politicians are
forever having trouble with the same basic
question of who lives upstairs and who lives
downstairs. There are. ofcoursc, exceptions to
every rule. Truman considered the move from
the White House back to Independence a
promotion. a view I seriously doubt Nixon
look when he moved back to San Clemente
and reneged on his promise to give itawuy. If
politicians could see straight. and recognize
the fact that public servant means exactly
what it says, they would ﬁnally be forced to
give up the completely illogical defense for
secrecy that has served so many governments
to well: embarrassment.

No one would stand fora butler who refuses
‘0 “Plain why hedidn'tanswer the door when
he was supposed to on the grounds that such
an answer would embarrass him. Yet. our

More rcccully. Nixon‘s luwycrs nrgucd. re
the disposition of “It tttpcs. that they not be
made available [or commercial release on tho
grounds that such rclcusc might result in ex-

prioritics with rcspccl to the public's right to
know any small pllrl ol'just what their servants
are up to. The obvious answer is that the ser-
vants should not be permitted to do unything
that is embarrassing, unlcssthcy chooscto live
with the consequences. The shield behind
which these servants wish to hide is illogical
and therefore dcscrvcs no place in American
or any other kind of politics.

A politician works for his constituency in a
way that bears no basic distinction from any
other type of employer-employee relationship.
Since he works in their interest, his actions are
the subject of whatever scnttiny they deem
necessary. The politician who a people hire to
carry out their government business for them
should never allow himself to become con-
fused. Thc people live upstairs, the politicians
live downstairs.

Mr. Nixon deserves everyone's con-
gratulations for being allowed to move back
upstairs well ahead of the usual servant s
schedule. Let it be it reminder to future ser—
vants. that the people are still in control, even
if it doesn't always look that way.

The annual clean-up for Community-University Day is, by this time. all finished.
Tomorrow come the parents and community to the school, and they‘ll go home
thinking that SUNYA is exciting, active and architecturally beautiful.

If they come back next month. however. they‘ll see the university in a more realistic
state and be disappointed. Things will be active. but not like on C-U day. Some
tiourcsccnt lights will be out and most walls will exhibit some din. it will still be
exciting but Wally Balloon won‘t be talking to children on the pOdium. Instead.
possibly, a student will ﬁnally grasp Descartes in a corner of the library.

President Fields has cited university involvement in the community also goal of his
administration. Community—University Day can be an important part ofencouraging
bcttcr relationships. True involvement. however, is continuous and honest. The
university should be kept in good condition at all times, and for the most part it is. But
no one is fooled by the paintjobs and cleaning that goes on before C-U day.So no one is
impressed. '

Whoever ordered the well-timed refurbishing has missed the point of community
involvement. The time spent on that work would better be spent on long-tents
investments that would bring SUNYA and the community closer together.

The subtle hypocrisy of C-U day is a common topic within the university, and that
discussion will produce for more damage to our school than the improved whitewash
image will add respect. The credibility of thead ministration is at stake. If they continue
to create an artificial environment for C-U day, they will continue to encounter on
campus gross apathy and cynicism towards the concept of community involvement.
The adminstration must become honest with the community before there can be trust
between SUNYA and Albany County. Only then will the rest of the university have
good reason to believe the administration is sincere about.‘ increased contact between
the school and the local area.
