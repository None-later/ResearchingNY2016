by Marla laultem h

To shave. or not to shave— that is the ques-
tion. Whether 'tis nobler in a woman's mind to
suffer the slings and arrows of an outrageous
razor. or to bear legs that resemble her Uncle
Frank’s. is a topic l pursued in the Campus
Center ladies‘ room Wednesday morning.

I didn't beat around the bush.‘“Do you
shave your legs and why?" I asked women as
they reached for a towel. put on mascara.
waited in line for a john. ’

Laurie. looking in the mirroras she brushed
her dark hair. replied: "Sometimes. Inwinter I
don‘t. in summer ldo. It depends. I hate to. I
really do. But i get pestered by the people I'm
going out with. Sometimes I‘m strong and say
‘tough shit.‘ "

While there's social pressure against hairy
legs. there‘s some pressure forthem. too. With
a time-out in our conversation to relieve
herself, Patricia responded. “I went three
years without shaving. I started shaving this
summer—l decided it was more important for
me to feel comfortable; I was uncomfortable
with hair on my legs. I feel no more pressure
about it as a feminist issue."

The question proved a hairy one to some.
With a blush and a giggle. Jane confessed. “I
don‘t shave my legs. Now everyone in the
bathroom knows!“ Laurie interjected"'You‘re
as red as l was!“ to a friend's reply. “I don't like
the look of hairy legs.“

Some were emphatic on that point:

have th ir I

. ,Wlt, ‘renrn ean‘d‘ale rattan. ‘
anti-shavers were emphatic. too:

i

“if men don‘t shave their legs. I don‘t see
why I have to)“. _

“I think it's stupid.” '

“I don‘t~seewhy l should;ldon‘taaa kind of
protest.” Only' one non-shaver liked her baby
legs for their hair: “It's warmer. than light
hair—I like the way,  looks.” None thought
like the Europeans that hairy legs are sexy.
though one thought of the Europeans: “In Eu-
rope. I think the standards are
changing...before. only the prostitutes shaved
their legs." ‘ '

None of the leg shavers sounded like
prostitutes. but some-sounded like potential
werewolves:

“I‘m very. very hairy.”

“I look like a birch tree if I don‘t shave my
legs; I‘m covered with hair...l can braid it
around February.”

One non-shaver solved her hairy dilemna a
la Watergate—by a cover-up: “I wear pants
99.9% of the time; when I wear shorts. lwear
kneesocks. Depilatories never work on me.
and with a razor I take off more skin than
hair.“ I

Depilatory—“an agent used for removrng
hair. wool. or bristles." A razor l soon learned.
as did everyone else in the ladies‘ room. is not
the only depilatory:

“I use wax; it lasts a month and works
terrific."

“My friends and I tried it——wc were going
berserk. How do you get it on?"

“With a wooden spatula. You melt the wax
in a pan «it‘s very hot...When it starts solidify-
ing. you put it on in strips. If you wrap it
around your leg it'a murder. Then you peel it
oi'f—-it‘s reusable! 'I first had it done in a
beauty parlor abroad—~l‘m Chilean; it's very
expensive. All the women there do it...it‘s not
something you can‘t bear...“

“Does it pull out the hair follicle?"

“That's the theory...“ Anotherjoins the con-
versation: "I went to somebody and had ‘a

Now you can legally get in a fight
and not get hurt. The sport is called
fencing. and there is a Fencing Socie-
tv at Albany State. .

"The Society isopcn to allwhoarc
interested. both male and female.“
said Roger Herbert. treasurer of
Fencing Club. “I would like to make
an appeal to all those who have
taken fencing in gym to join the
society. If you were interested

The society is funded by Student

Herbert. the money is very much
