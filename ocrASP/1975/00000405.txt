Albany outshot Oswcgu. III-l5.

“Wc turned in another good per-

coach. “Selca did a fine job. as did
Arango who was playing his lirst

Schiel'fclin also praised haltbacks
Simon Curanovic and John Roland.

“(‘uranovicdid a heck oI'ajob out

Schicfl'clin. "and Rolando appears
to have regained his form of two
years ago. Rolando is our
playmakcr."

“I was particularly pleased with
the job Ilcnry ()bwald did in the
goal." continttcd Schicffclin. "l-lc
handlcd the hall chI in the pouring
rain and stopped two ouc-on-goal
situations."

Anotltcr pcrlortncr of note was
l’cpc Aguilar. who filled in at ccntcr
fullback for tltc injured Ricardo
Rosc.

“Aguilar is not a fancy player."
