Sports Sexism, Evident D

by Marla Abrams

According to Kathy Maloncy.
Athletics Advisory Board (AAB)
Chairperson. “Title IX is being
adhered to by the AAB.although the
author of the bill did not wish it used
in the manner that the Federal
government enforces it.“

Title IX of the Education
Amendments of I9724states that “no
person may be subjected to dis-
crimination based on sex in any
scholastic, intercollegiate. clubor in-
tramural athletics offered by a
recipient of federal education aid."

Dave Coync. Central Council
Chairperson. feels that the
“vugucncss of Title IX " allows for
misinterpretation of the law and
possible discrimination. For exam-
ple. he states that students who excel
in football “are admitted under the
Special Students Admissions
Program. but this really onlyapplics
to males." He also says that "the
overall increase in men‘s athletic
budget from 19744975 was ap-
proximately to percent as compared
to .(1 percent for women.“

According to Athletics Director
.loc Garcia. “It is impossible to com-
plll‘t‘ lhc women‘s budget to the
men‘s due to differences in the
number of teams and participation.
“Presently. there are clcvcn mcn‘s
varsity tennis and nincjunior varsity
tcnms. while the women have six var-
sity teams and one junior varsity
team." Mr. Garcia cites the I975
budget as about Sl49.558. with
$|24.I68 for men's sports and $25.-

adds that “a lot of thc tnoncy in thc
men‘s budget is also applicable to
women‘s sports.“

Gurcin explains that “when illlc
AM) was formed around I952. the
people involved in the board were a
far-sighted group who tried to
develop a co-cducational athletic
program. They set up criteria for for-
ming teams which apply equally to
both sexes."

“The AAB docs not deny any
sport to conic undcr AAll."says Ms.
Miiloncy. who is also at mctnhcr of
thc womcn‘s swim team. “After thrcc
years. a sports club can petition to

become a varsity or junior varsity
team. It doesn‘t work on n male of
female basis.“

Several members of the AAB who
were interviewed agree that the “lan
of women s participation" is the
motion for what may be considered
"unequal" funding of men‘s and
women‘s sports,

Lcslic Hour.womcn's coordinator
on the AMI states that “we are
following thc guidelines ofTitIc IX.
htit wc criii‘t do anything unless the
students come and ask forthc sport.“
Knthy Maloncy believes that part of

due to “apathy of the student body

New York City Loses Use  Pension Aid;
Default 0n Municipal Debts Draws Near

ALBANY.N.Y.(AP)Thcmrindutod
use of public-cmploycc pension
funds to stave off default by New
York City was ruled un-
constitutional Monday by the state‘s
highest court. ruisingthcdangcrthat
the city could collapse in a matter of
weeks. The 6-! decision by the Court
of Appeals struck down legislation
requiring the use of $725 million in
pension funds as part of a $2.3
billion cnzcrgcncy financing plan to
kccp the city from default through
November.

The decision did not ban the usc of
the funds if static Comptroller
Arthur Levitt and other trustees of
the pension monicsdccidc voluntari-
ly. in their discretion. to use them.
But it said the legislature could not
require them to do so. And Levitt
previouth had balked at investing
pension money in borrowings ofthc
city or Municipal Assistance Corp.
without such a legislative mandate.

If the pension funds are not used.
the rest of the ﬁnancing plan will
provide only enough funds to stave
off default through mid or late Oc-
tober. according to estimates by
MAC.

The court ruling also may in-
directly threaten other parts of the
plan. particularly the efforts of the
state to borrow on behalf of the
city.Thc court’s interpretation of the
state's constitution of the state's con-
stitution is ﬁnal and cannot be
appealed.

Gov. Hugh Carey issued {1 icrsc
statement declaring that tlic court
ruling “has clearly complicated our
problem“ But he pledged to “review
ll“ possible alternatives and proceed
with thcjobofsaving New York City
from default.“

The state Civil Scrvicc Employccs
Association and the Police Con-
ference of New York had brotight
suit arguing that the legislation
\‘lOlllICd the constitutional guarantee
that the pension rights of public
cmplycs not be impaired. Their suit
was aimed directly only tit the $125
million dcsignulcd from ilicir
mcmhcrs‘ pension funds. but the
court threw out the entire suction.
which inundated $600 million in
other investments.

Chief Judge Cliurlcs Brcilcl. in the
majority opinion. ncknowlcgcd the
“obvioust compelling illld urgcnt
stringency with which the city and
state are faced.“

But the court held that to strip the
state comptroller “of his personal
responsibility and commitment to
his oath of office. is to remove a
safeguard integral to the scheme of
maintaining the security of the
sources of benefits for over a half
century." “The legislature is
powerless in the face of the con-
stitutional non-impainn cnt clause to
mandate that he (the comptroller)
mindlessly invest in whatever
securities they direct. good. in-
different. or bad." Brcitelcontinued.

chitt dircctly controls only the
state cmploycs‘ rctircmcnt ftind and
a statewide lund for retired
policemen and firemen. which were
tapped fora total of $|25 million.

Ollicr pcnsion funds-r including
the New York City cmploycs‘.
police. fire. lcuchcrs' and statewide
tcaclicrs‘ pension funds- are con-
trolled by others. and could con-
ccivnbly be persuaded to invest
voluntarily in IllL‘ city‘s borrowings.

Under the (‘ourl of Appctils riil-
ing. they could mic-st not only the
$600 million inundated by law. but
enough to make up tlic$|25 million
under Levitt‘s control if he rcfiiscs to
use it. However. some Ciircy iiidcs
expressed lt‘ill‘ tliht thczidvcrsc psy—
chological impact of thc rtiliiig
would itot only make the lrustccsof
those other pcnsion funds reluctant
to make voluntary use of their
monies. but also mu kc it harder for
the state to borrow the $750 million
it is raising us It dirch contribution to
thc bail-out puckugc.

Moreover. some other prirtsof the
$2.3 billion bailout package. in-
cluding up to $436 million in bank
funds. were supposed to have been
contingent on the entire package go-
ing forward intact. and officials
were concerned those parts of the
plan could now fall apart.

State Supreme Court Justice A.
Franklin Mahoncy of Albany had
ruch last week that the investment
of the Sl25 million was not un-

towards women‘s sports.“ She adds
that the “calibcr of competition is
different." '

Ms. Hoar fccls that the problem
also stems from “a lack of adcquatc
covcntgc in the ASP.“ This attitude
is shared by Ellen Dcutschmiin. a
member of the Coalition for
Educational and Cultural Frccdom.
She feels that “if women were made
ilWilfc of the sports aivailablc. this
would increase participation."

Dich Coync bclicvcs (hill the
NCAA's interpretation of Title IX.
us well its AAII's prcscnt funding
policy “reinforces the way men and
women are SOClulllcd to feel about

esp-ite: .Athletic'Law ‘

women's sports.”‘I-I‘e'saystliat more
money for women's athletics would
“generate a greater degree of par-
ticipation)? V x ' ‘ ., V' "

Ms. Maloney. however. states that
“men‘s athletics funds should notbc
cut to increase the women‘s budget
since the smaller number of women
participants would not justify totally
cqual funding.“ She adds that
"H.E.W. reviewed AAB‘s policyand
felt that it fully conformed to the es-
tablished guidelines of Title IX."

Use Excess Money

Ms. Deutschmiin feels that. its ii
solution to the problem ofudditional
funding for women. "Central Coun-
cil should take thc money they an-
ticipate to be in cxccssrit the end of
the term to providc for it women's
sports program. if the women so
desire. instead of spending that
money on beer. Otherwise. this
money should be available to
minority groups such as Feminist
Allitincc. FIICFIII Latino and EDP-
SA."

Nonetheless. Ms. Miiloncy and
Mr. (inhiii fch that women‘s pur-
ticiprttion is increasing in sports.
“Women are presently developing
intramural programs in soccer. as
well its flog football." says Garcia.
“Co-cductitioniil volleyball and
cross-country arc in the process of
petitioning for a club." according to
Ms. lloiir.

Kiitliy Mnloncy adds that “two
women's teams have increased their
schedules. wliilc contests have in-
creased on the women's swim team.“

by the high court with only ludgc
Lowrcncc Cookc dissenting. Cooke
wrote that “there is no basis for the
finding of the majority that the dis-
cretion ofthc comptroller.as trustee.
is a beneﬁt within the contemplation
of the constitution."
" Brcitel acknowledged that the
non-impairment clause of the con-
stitution applied “literally” only to
the maintenance of f inaneiai beneﬁts
of the pension systems. But he
argued that the constitutional provi- .
sion also implied a protection of the
sources of the beneﬁts. and thus for-
