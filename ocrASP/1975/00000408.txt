consisting solely of faculty members.
Senator David Lemer. a senior.
feels that the faculty who voted
against students did so mostly out of
ignorance. He felt it to be a case of
emotionalism versus logic. “It did n't
surprise me that it was close.“ he
said.
Lerner saw part of the problem in
the students being spoiled. “They
have nothing to fight for.“ He seem-
ed critical of Student Association‘s
feeling that a sit-in would have been
detrimental to thestudents‘position.
Lerner sees a grim future for the
students‘ position on the Senate.
The major arguments presented
by the anti-student faculty iticludcd
objection to the student‘s power to
vote on ltis,’ her own degree rc-
quiremcnts. complaints about the
trivial nattirc of the subject matter
presented by the » students at
meetings. a nd the point that students
have their own governing body. Cen-
tral Council. devoted to student cort-
cerns. which the faculty has no such
body.
Malcolm Sherman. a professor in
the Math department. last year's
E chairperson of the Educational
'I’olicies Committee. rind presently a
Senator. is felt by many to be the
most outspoken faculty member
against studcm membership. l-le
complains of a "polarization" of
issues into anti or pro-student. as
well as cooperation and organiza-
lioti of the students before meetings
resulting in a type of student
solidarity He also feels that many
students approach the Senate as
"politicians" who “want to make a
record." ‘Not that lbclievetlrar only
faculty can run it properly.“ be said.
“’I'hcrc is just too big a gulf of age
and interest." He feels that the facul-
ty won‘t be frank in the pressure: of
students. He riicnlioried also the
“irresponsibility of many student

senators.“ and calls this a “natural
consequence of youth."

Coyne called Sherman's attitude a
"mockery". He pointed out that
students attended Senate meeings
even before they received the right to
actively participate (in I969). and
that faculty members managed to be
frank then. He also mentioned that
faculty members seeking tenure need
to build up "records" as well as
students.

Coyne also disagrees with the
point that students polarizc issues
saying that the only such issue that
he knows of is the question of stu-
dent participation in the Senate.and
that lie knows of many occasions
when tlrerc has been ohviousstudent
disscnsion on issues.

Coyne agrees with many faculty
members who say that last year‘s
Senate was relatively ineffective but
attributes this greatly to Sherman‘s
refusal “to deal with students on the
Senate as equals. making it difficult
for the Senate to function.“ “He is
fighting a one man. full—time battle
to dump students." Coyne said. “and
l lirrve no respect for him." “He
carries ri torch everywhere. and
won‘t accept his loss and try to work
together with students." '

Many university community
members. both sttrdcritsand faculty.
support the idea ofa faculty forum in
addition to the Senate comprised
only of teaching faculty for the sole
purpose of discussing faculty related
and academic issues. S.A. President
Andy Baumaii pointed oirt iir his
speech to the faculty at the August 26
meeting. that all issues in a university
co trimunily a fleet all members of the
community itt some way. and
therefore each facet should share in
tire decision making of the corn-
mrinity. the University Senate.

university—wide issues to he trrkcrr

Professor Richard Kendall. Dean
of the School of Social and
Behavioral Sciences. though not in
favor of eliminating students from
the Senate. does not feel that
students should have the power to
vote on academic issues. calling it ii
“conflict of interests“. He therefore
feels that such questions should be
turrted overto the teaching faculty of
each individual college in the Un-
iversity. While noting the ineffec-
tiveness of the Senate in past years.
Ire added. “I don‘t believe that the
deficiencies of the Senate are
because of student invol\enient.". He

David Coyne noted. in response to
Kendall‘s proposal. that all students

accepted. and therefore nei eraetual-
ly legislate their own degree re-

do. Kendall feels that slrrdcrits are
