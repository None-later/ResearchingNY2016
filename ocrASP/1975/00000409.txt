 tober ID. 1974, the Vietnam Era
’ Readjustment Act of I974 was pass-

ed? by Congress. increasing the
monthly educational assistance
allowance by 22.7% for all eligible
veterans. The maximum entitlement
was extended from 36 to 45 months
for undergraduates. This extension
cannot be used forgraduatewmk. A
single veteran who qualiﬁes as a full
time student is eligible to receive
benefits up to ten years after
severance.

Ed Tillistrand. one of the co-
directors of the Veterans Informa-
tion Center. feels that many of the
veterans on campus are unaware of
the benefits offered to them by the
federal government. His primary
concern is helping to implement a
work-study program that all full—
time student veteransarc eligible for.
This program is sponsored by the
Veterans Administration (V.A.).

Tillistrand feels that “it‘s a very
ﬂexible program in that you can
work out your assignment with your
supervisor." He stressed that the vet
can work varying hours depending
on his agreement with his supervisor.

CThe ﬁnancial aids office assigns

campus. These incliide’ the'lilirary,

‘ the veterans representative office. or

the ’V'eterans‘llnfoimation centers

Under this program the veteran is;

eligible to work up to 250 hours a

year for which he would receive

5625,

Many veterans are hesitant when
dealing with the V.A. Tillistrand
feels that although in the past the
VA. has had a reputation of
bureaucratic foul-ups, .f‘the situation
has changed. Overthe last yearand a
half our relations with the V.A. have
improved |00%. due to structural
changes within the V.A. itself. The

biggest improvement has been the'

assignment of VA. representatives
on campus.“ He feels this has put the
student veteran on a more per-
sonalized relationship with the V.A..
rather than phone or mail contact
which was the original procedure.
These V.A. representatives were
originally located i  Campus
Center but have since lwcn moved to
room IS} in the Administration
Building.

Tillistrand stresses that the role of
the Veterans Information Center is
to distribute information. Presently.
according to 'l'illistrand they have
been unable to locate all eligible
veterans on campus. He says this is
because of the “unavailability of a
complete mailing list'with the ad-
dresses of student veterans qualified
for V.A. benefits on campus.“
Tillistrand states that this is due to
the fact that the school's computers
aren't programmed to give a list of,
these veterans. The Veterans Infor-

mation Center is waiting for this to

,be done. Tillistrand says. “I don't]

have any qualms with the university.
It‘s' just a technical foul-up that I
hope will be shortly overcome."
The track record for the Veterans
lnforrnation Center is a very good

one. A year and a halt'ago there was .

only one student vet on campus us-
ing the Work-study program.
Although Tillistrand says that he
can‘t quote an actual ﬁgure. he es-
timates that this amount has. in-
creased overa hundredhold. He feels

that, ‘slnce we‘ve gotten a working
relationship between the university
and our office, we have managed to
provide pleat of work-study oppor.
tunities for veterans.“ He also adds
that. “there are still many Oppor.
tunities available."

 

Veterans, where are you? Located In Draper Hall, the Veterans lnlormatlon Center has had
difficulties contacting all eligible vets on campus.

Food  Mall   _ 

by Anthony Schmltz

A change in food stamp eligibility
requirements scheduled to take
effect in many states this fall may cut
thousands of students from the food
rolls, according to
Agriculture Department officials.

An eligibility revision made early
last year will bar students from mid-
die and upper-class households from
the food stamp program. New
Agriculture Department regulations
require that students whose parents
claim them as income tax
dependents be dropped from the
program unless their pa rents are also
receiving food stamps.

The ban applies to students more
than [8 years old who attend any
post-secondary institution and get
more than half oftheir income from
a household with too much money to
qualify for food stamps.

Accurate figures on how many
students will be eliminated by the
change in regulations are un-
available. according to department

ofﬁcials. but some non-govem‘m'ent
studies have .shown that “runny
thousands“ of students receive food

'stamps. ofﬁcials added.

Although the eleigibility change
was sent to county and state ad-
ministrators in February.difﬁculties
in implementing the changes have
forced many states to postpone any
policychanges until this fall. depart-
ment ofﬁcials said.

Food stamp program ad-
ministrators felt a crack-down was
needed. according to Bob Welch. a
food program supervisor. because
“so many peoplcclaimcd that college
students were abusing the program.
There was so much bad publicity
about students that we wanted to do
something to assure people that the
needy are the people being served by
the food stamp program."

Welch said the change was “one
way of squelching the idea some peo-
ple had that food stamps were being
abused.“

This year‘s change in eligibility is

Ambulance Retired at Last

Five Quad Volunteer Ambulance
Service will finally be able to retire
its old. white 1960 ambulance that
many of you have seen at athletic
events and around the campus. Last
Friday Five Quad finalized the
purchase of a I968 Cadillac am-
bulance in excellent condition.

The replacement was made
necessary by the large repairs that
would have been needed to keep the
I960 ambulance running. Even with
the repair work that vehicle would
still be poor as a regularly used
emergency vehicle. 

l‘he purchase of the l968 am—
bulance was from Slopcr-Willen
Community Ambulaneel in Wap-
pingers Falls. NY. ’l'heir offer was

very generous as the ambulance
could easily have sold for $2.300.
Five Quad was given a price of$l.-
300. Several ambulances had been
investigated and since thisone was in
such good condition and at such a
low price Five Quad accepted. and
purchased the ambulance with its
own funds.
Almost Ready

Within four weeks thisumbulancc
should be ready to enter service as
Five Quad‘s second ambulance. It
will cover sports events. provide
back-up for multiple-injury calls.
serve as back-up when the other am-
bulance is down for repairs. and
assist with the many training courses
offered by Five Quad.

Students who aren‘t claimed by

anyone with an adjusted tnonthly in-

justments are made to account for
medical costs. rent. child care and
other expenses.

The bill is scheduled for hearings

Council Rejects Proposal
For Ra tingAdministrators

by Daniel O'Connell

At last Wednesday‘s Central
Council meeting opposition lead by
Rich Greenbcrg (Colonial) forced
withdrawal from potential use of an
“Administrator Evaluation Form“.

The form asked SA personnel
and others who have meeting with
administrators their reactions regar-
dingthc encounters. Afterwards. the
forms would have been used as
background information for persons
going into a meeting with any par—
ticulur administrator for the first
time. Various members charged such
a system of file keeping was in fact
reminiscent of CIA. FBI and
Watergate tactics.

Also at the meeting. SA President
Andy Bauman announced the
resignation from the Supreme Court
by ASP Editor in Chief Daniel
(iaines. The resignation sprung from
question being raised asto a possible
conflict of interest created by his
holding both jobs. Gainesdenied the
conflict but gave other reasons for
his leaving the court.

(iaines also wamcd the President
to beware of rumored attempts of
Council Chairperson David Coyne
to stack the court “with unti-AAB
people so cases would bcdccidedin
his own philosophical direction over
the next few months“. Coync stated
flatly that these rumors were false.
