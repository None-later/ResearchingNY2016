SEARCHING THE SEAS
' The UnitedStates government has
quietly been'conducting a series of

tests to determine the feasibility of:

establishing a major “nucleardump”
three miles under« the ocean off the
coast of Hawaii.

The Honolulu Star-Bulletin

reports that government scientists.
while admitting the tests are being
carried out "q uictly", insists there is
nothing “secret” about them.

The government is frantically
looking fora method fordisposal of

“5,400 feet below the surface. The
problem with nuclear wastes is that
they remain toxic to all forms of life
for up to 250.000 years—a period of
time 25 times longer than, all of
recorded human history.

Critics of the undersea dumping
proposal warn that small leaks could
occur hundredsoreven thousands of
years from-today. and that theescap-
ing radiation would pollute sea life,
the base of the human food chain.

FORD DOWN ON DOPE

President Ford—in his firstpublic
statement on the marijun no question
since becoming president—sayshe is
opposed to the decriminalization of
marijuana.

The President was asked during ii
press conference this week if he
favored the removal of criminal
penalties against persons who smoke
pot in private.

Ford replied: "I do not believe we
have sufficient evidence at the pre-
sent time to wa rrantany recommen-
dation in that regard.“Thc President
added that. because he found “no
consensus" of opinion about the
effects of pot smoking. he remains
opposed to the dccriniinulinition of
grass.

DESTROYED
The New York Times reports that
J. Edgar Hoovermay have personal-

delivered by Lee Harvey Oswald to

the FBI just l0diiysbclorc President

According to the Timer. Oswald
hand-delivered a letter to lltc Dallas

that he intended to "blow tip" the
Dallas police department.

The newspaper quotes current
Hll sourccsas disclosing that on the
weekend following the assassina-

ordered the Dallas office to destroy
the letter. According to the Times. its

Hosty. later told the commission
that Oswald had neverdemonstrated
any propensity toward violence.

In addition. it is not made clear
why the FBI took no action against
Oswald iii the time over his reported
threat. It would seem to be a depar-
ture from normal FBI policy to per-
mit a self-avowed Marxist. who had
recently returned from the Soviet
Union. to walk into the Bureau‘s
headquarters and hand-deliver a
letter threatening to dynamite the
local police department.

The FBI indicated to the Warren
Commission that it had complete
knowledge of Oswald’s work and
home address in the weeks preceding
the assassination.

It is also not clear why Oswald
would make threats against the
Dallas police. The Dallas police

MUSICAL WEAPONS

Paciﬁc News Service reports that
the Pentagon has covered up an in-
vestigation into charges that US.
nuclear warheads in South Korea
may have been dangerously mis-
handled. and perhaps even lost.

Paciﬁc News writer Guy Gibson.
iii a copywrited story for The Dallas
Iconoclast. has released a copy of a
letter which triggered the Pentagon's
investigation two years ago. The
letter was written by Wisconsin Con-
gressman Les Aspin.

Aspin's letter quotes sources as
saying that at least three army of-
ﬁcers discovered that there were
serious inventory discrepancies
regarding nuclear warheads being

' held at math security areas in '

South res... _

According to Aspin, the dir-
crepancies, in some cases, involved
nuclear warheads listed on inventory
sheets which could not be located.

Aspin told ‘the Pentagon [hm
when a high-level defense depart.
ment ofﬁcial visited Korea from
Washington, array ofﬁcers in Korea
conspired to hide the discrepancies.

According to Aspin, nuclear
bombs were literally moved around
at night sothat the inventory records
appeared to match the number of
warheads in stock.

that the Senate Select Committceon

Internal
Affairs

by Arthur Bedford

It has been repeatedly stated and reaffirmed
by Education Opportunity Program Student
Association officers and members. past and
present. that EOPSA represents all minority
students on campus; meaning Afro-American
students. Caribbean students (West Indian
students). Spanish-speaking students (e.g.
Latin-American students) and other minority
students. This “idea of representation" is in
fact a myth. EOI’SA may be opened to all
minority students to become members. but it
does not represent all minority students.

The time has come to shed some light on the
facts concerning the relationship between
EOPSA and Caribbean students. We are all
well aware ofthc hassles that went on between
SA and EOI’SA during' the ‘75 Spring

0

I' .
‘ approached by some; bbean students with

the idea of a Caribbean: Club and they
proposed that it beréc‘ogii‘iped as a subgroup

"or corss. funded and controlled by that

organization. Mr. Stokelin's reply to this
proposal was to the etTeet that. we (meaning
EOPSA) plan for “home” first and then think
of “away” later. This clearly meant that there
was no consideration for Caribbean students
on campus. by this organization that was sup-
posed to represent all minority students.

A look at the ofﬁcersand members of E0?-
SA.pae.t and present. will reveal that there has
been and are few minority students other than
“Afro-American" students in participation.
lts‘ subgroups. Black Gold. etc. are populated
if not totally. then primarily by Afro-
American students. And EOPSA's biggest ac-
tivity. Black Week. should in fact be called
“Afro—American Entertainment Week“. since
there is no representation of African. Carib-
bean. or Latin—American cultures.

At the time of the planning of last year's
Black Week‘s activities the idea was put forth
by the Haitian students to give a performance
portraying their culture. This idea was turned
down.

How can there then be participation by
Caribbean students in an organization where
there is not consideration for them and where
there is 'no encouragement given them? For
these reasons. most Caribbean students take
the view that they will not tread where they are
left out and forgotten.

This piece is not intended to create “bad
feelings" betwoen EOPSA and Caribben
students or any other minority students but

rather it is intended to improve the
relationship between the two. and to bring
about an awareness to the concerns of Carib-
bean students. and to create a better un-
derstanding in the future. It is hoped that there
be closer ties and greater cooperation. now
and iii the future. amongst all minority
students and that we work together to achieve

 

our goals.

Treatment
by Arthur lltdalgo' ‘

With the inception of every freshmen year
actions that were new the pre‘ceed‘lig yearturn
old and those that wereold become passe. This
is evident in the following areas: thedrift. or in
other words. the unfortunate ‘self-chosen

' segregation“ of blacks and whites; the rising

freshmen disaffection with an age-old school
policy that accepts more students than can be
adequately accommodated; and. a practice
that l have no way of knowing whether it new
or not. the "Tough luck!” syndrome faced by
the Educational Opportunity Program
students.

EOP is an extremely worthwhile and
necessary educational program for students
wlv- wouldn't have otherwise entered the state
university system. Students enrolled in the
program are in it because they don't have the
high average required by regular admission
standards and/ or the ﬁnancial resources to af-
ford them a university education. However.
they have special talents and personal
characteristics to offer to the university. In a
sense. t hey are in the university to add a special
aura to it and to make ita fuller. well-rounded

. institution of learning.

An act that should draw attention to the
plight of the EOP students is the “cold treat-
ment“ they received in relation to their hous-
ing contracts (and other freshmen info).

When EOP students arrived registration
week. it was a minor miracle that they found
thems-"ves rooming with other EOP students.
(That ..iis true. at least. downtown; where

‘ most EOP students were placed in triple oc-
cupancy. no less.)

When an EOP student tried to inquireinthe
Housing ofﬁce as to the mason why he had not
been placed with his requested roommate (a
regular admissions student). the ﬁrst thing
that was asked of him was when had he mailed

or indirectlyi _ .
these lncidenta.(To

’received such ‘ivﬂ , _
thattliere was not ing that they

ln.more down-to-eattli language they

freshmen material late. Afterall.theofflcesof I
housing. ﬁnancial aid. etc..don't have any
moral obligation to EOI’ students to see to it
that they are we'll-informed and comfortable
in their future “home'.0r do they? They
better. or else we‘re in serious trouble. 1

Such arrogance and enmity on the part of
the administration is especially not requisite
so early in one‘s collegeeareer. And to be prac-
tically told that if one is an EOP student you
have to take things as they come in sad thing.
especially if it‘s true.

My main concern is the way that the ad-.
ministration “takes dire“ of these students.
Educational Opportunity Program students
are no different from any other students on
this campus. Their objective is to continue
their education and have a decent chance to
get a satisfactory job on the social scale that
bettering themselves. It is hard to accomplish
this when one is. literally. thrown around.

The school administration may do this
"juggling" unintertionally. but the fact of the
matter is that it is happening. It should end
before EOP students go in the same direction
as some regularly admitted students. That is.
dropping out of school at the end of one and a
half days on campus. as a result of their dis-
contentment with the way things are handled
by the school.

More than that. EOP sutdents should be
treated as individuals and given the human
courtesy that cverybodyso deserves. They and
no one else on campus merits it “Get lost. kid.
You bother me!"
