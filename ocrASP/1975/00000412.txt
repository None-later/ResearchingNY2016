- -To the "bar:

' Last week. in order to advertise a social
function, the members of Zenger hall placed a
large banner in the Colonial cafeteria. The
banner displayed, along with all pertinent
data. a slogan whereby members of the female
sex who chose of their own volition. to remain
at the hall the entire night through would be
entitled to a small monetary compensation for
their thoughtfulness. To be exact. the slogan
read. “Rebate: Any woman who spends the
night gets one dollar ' back."

It appears that certain members of the
cafeteria staff looked on such aproposal with
great disdain. The announcement was remov-
ed and a cloth used to cover the slogan.

I ﬁnd this a deplorable act which could very
well pave the way to severe setbacks in our
freedom of speech. Perhaps you do not con-
sider it so serious. but consider the conse-
quences. That banner was protecting our

" rights — even our right to say insigniﬁcant
things like "pine cone". I mean as long as it
isn't prohibited to say “cunt”. l‘m sure' it won't
be illegal to say “cake”. In fact. [would go' so
far as to make it a law by which all public
buildings would be required to houses banner
with the word P‘ciocksucker“ prominently dis-
played in l2 inch block letters.

Perhaps you think lam pressings point too
far. but as soon as one little miniscule right is
abused and goes undefended. then a little
larger right is abused until the NYS Depart-
ment of Education places the novels Breakfast
of Champions and The Winter of Our Discon-
tent on its list of books not to be purchased by
public high school libraries. '

After all. aren't we here to learn. toexplore.
to widen our experience. and to have a fine
time in the process? Isn‘t education the cor-
nerstone of freedom? lsn't knowledge of the
alternatives the only way to act responsibly?
For such actions to take root here would be far
greater than disastrous. Freedom is too hard
won. and too easily lost. Let us never forget
what Lenny Bruce said. “You (society) need
your dcgenerntcs!“

The Other Side

of the Moon

To the Editor:

The September 9 issue of the ASP con-
tained an article on the Unification Church en-
titled: "Exploring 0n the Darker Side of the
Moon" by David Winzelbcrg. As a graduate
student who met and joined this movement
about ten months ago. and subsequently
represented CARP on the SUNYA campus
that spring. lnm well aware of thccontroversy
surrounding both the Church and CARP. Out
of consideration for CAR P members on cam-
pus. as well as those who expressed support
for us. I feel compelled to make some reply to
this article.

Despite the fact that CARP is for the mo-
ment not recognised by the Student Associa-
tion. I can see no excuse for theASP toviolute
its responsibility for objectivity and fairness
by featuring this collection of untrue and un-
founded statemetits asa legitimateand factual

the time to’do some basic. respond, V
ing of facts with Churdr/ofl‘iehls. Had this ef-
fort been made. you would have easily found
the facts to be quite different than wltat
appearediin the article.
The article is most seriously damagingin the
author's allegation that Rev. Moon “has been
married four times"and "served a three month
jail sentence for conducting group sex
orgies...” This is absolutely untrue. The facts
are that Rev. Moon wasimprisoned on a draft
law technicality and hiscritics later added the
charge of conducting sex orgies. The charge
was subsequentlydropped for laclt of evidence
after a thorough government investintion.

I As to' the allegation of being married four
times. Rev. Moon has been married ﬁfteen
years to his second wife. He was divorced by
his ﬁrst wife mainly for the amount of time
Church activities demanded of him. Rumors

  
 

 
 
  

concerning sexual misconduct and multiple
marriages originated more than twenty years
ago in Korea. through the efforts of a minority
of hostile opponents because of Rev. Moon's
popularity.

it is interesting to note that in support of
Rev. Moon. |00 Korean professors issued a
proclu motion stating in part: “it is regrettable
that a small minority of Koreans have misin-
formedly or maliciously slandered the Un-
iﬁcation Church....Reportedly. such slander
also has been spread in America. misleading
the honest public of this fron-
tierslnnd.....Thcse charges are truly senseless
and are to be lamented." (New York Times.

l2/ l3/74)

The few out of context passages quoted in
the ASP came from freely translated cxtcm-
pornncous talks by Rev. Moon. These tnlks
deal primarily with specific religious concems-
God's work in history. lovc. spiritual growth.
etc. Yet. none of the quotes given presented
tiny of these aspects.

In.thc article it is stated that the Church
employs "brainwashing" tactics and tries to
suprcss the thought processes ofits members.
This is not only absurd. but an unsubstan-
tiated allegation. The Unification Church has
it message. and this message has been able to
inspire and motivate people to lead an active
and purposeful life. This message is being
taught by experienced members through
dialogues. lectures and group discussion-
stundard educational procedures.

It is claimed that members are constantly
exposed to lectures and to Rev. Moon‘s
writings which tends to “mind manipulation“.
One has to ask if it is possible to learn
something new without studying it. Does “ex-
posure” to lectures and an author‘s writings
constitute “mind manipulation"? DO ex-
pressions ofinterest and excitement in having
a new and comprehensive frame of reference
presented to you automatically make you a
“psychological slnvc"?

A more realistic viewpoint is that pcopleurc
joining this movement because they see it as
something positive. creative and valuable for
themselves nnd for the world. They stay
because their ideals are being concretely
realised in a practical step-by-step way
through their own hard work. giving them the
joy of nccomplishment and a sense of growth
and purpose.

Accusations of brainwashing stem almost
entirely from members who had been
physically kidnapped and forcibly imprisoned
while undergoing highly questionable tactics
to change their thinking. For example. one
member who refttscd to submit to
“depragramming” offers a view of this
process: “About charges that the church
“brainwashed” her. Christen Auscnhaus said.
“the only brainwasing that took place was

‘ ' j-tio'
. do withother groups thqt have strong Satanic V
leanings...” (Dundee- Sun. Omaha.  .

11/22/73) ' . a. .
Dan Burke who lad at. ed several
workshops. although not a member, had this
to say about deprognmming: “Nobody at
Barrytown (workshop location) ever held me
in a room by force fora marathon propaganda
session the way Patrick does when he’s hired
by parents. It scares me to think that Pqtriek's
methods are viewed as being socially, accep-
table." (Knickerbocker News. May. I975)

Besides this misrepresentation of the
“depragramming” experience in the article.
many other statements made or quoted about
the Church are totally untrue and derogatory.
For example. the statement that Church
members “are threatened with dath...if they

Castles Burning
My T.V. Game Show

 

 

 

bv Kat Wax

_ Gameshows mean big dollars to television networks. and they've proliferated to the point
where almost every conceivable game idea is already on the tube. This presents a problem to
network executives who are hungry for more of these low-budget. high-profit shows. and word
has trickled through the broadcast business grapevine thatSl0.000 awaits anyonewho comes up
with a really new idea for a game show. So. l've taken a stab.

As I see it, the inherent weakness found in all the current shows is that they're boring. Sure.
there are screaming audiences applauding household n'ppliances and money hungry contestants
shrieking for prizes. but there‘s no real excitement. You know someone is going to leave the
studio a few thousand dollars richer than they cntcred.you knowthe emcee will have a sparkling
smile and impeccable manners and you know someone will win that new car. Game showsare all
happiness and smiles.

Let‘s meet the contestants. First there's the returning champ. Having won yesterday. she's
come back for a second, big try today. and we'll be getting another twenty second glimpse of her
existence. (this one perhaps even more revealing than yesterdays where we learned her kids‘
names.)

“Welcome back Jenn! Yesterday Jean won S————. and she‘s back today to increase that
amount. rightJean?‘ (Jean nods dumbly and mutters somethingin theaffirmative. but the mike‘s
not on.) With interest as genuine as his smile. the emcee continues.

"Yesterday you told us that you like to knit. .lean. Tell usa little more about that . .  And
Jean tells him that she likes to knit scarves. Or maybe she makes beaded ﬂowers. Or she likes to
bake. As long as its boring. Because they'rculways boring. Just once I‘d likcto hear. "Wcll.Jcnn.
it says here that your mother is an alcoholic. Just how much can the ol'lush down inn dtty. .lcutt‘l“
But no. you'll never see that on any show that‘s on TV now.

Which is where my show would pick up.

“Say. Jean. the curd here says that your husband was arrested a few years back and churgcd
with bestiality. Tell the viewers a little about that swan . . ." If Jean wantsn chance to win my
show's money. she'll have to give a little . . .

My emcee will not be the stunning. nice—guy type you've come to expect. Nosirree. my emcee
will be grubby. obnoxious. and definitely threatening. l'm tired of these guys who always keep
their manners. .le'an and Tom have lot: and 94 points respectively. and Sue is sitting there in front
of 20 million people with 9 measer points. And shejust blew her latest try . . .“Gee l‘m sorry.
Sue. but the answer is Washing/on. George Washington was the ﬁrst president. But maybe you‘ll
blicuk your unlucky streak with this one . . ." and the show moves right along. Not so on my
s ow.

“And Sue got to her buzrer ﬁrst. what's your answer? Columbus? Jcez. Sue. you are u stupid
one. ain't ya‘? thw. I'd be mortiﬁed if I was you. kid. half the nation knowsyou‘readuncc.
Columbus. Wow. you qualify for the idiot award. Tell me. Sue did you cheat on the contestant
qualifying test? Huh. didja? C'mon. you can tell me . . ."

And lastly. no more of this something for nothing set-up. There‘s simply not enough pressure
Ln liltc tube today. for if worst comes to worst. a eontestant‘ll leavethe show with no winnings. Big

cu .

It'll be different on m'show. Sure. you‘ll still be able to win an all expense paid trip around the
world. but you may lose the deed to your house. Or your car. And on the night-time version.
lucky contestants may haVe a chance to win 525.000. But if they blow it. they will have to giVe up
their ﬁrst born to slavery.

Now. are you going to tell me that you'd rather watch Beat-The-Clock?

i Fields.

Saturday‘s inauguration of SUNYA President Emmett'B. Fields reminds the A.

university that he has been on campus less than three months. It is still tooearly to
detect in what direction Fields will move the school. but it is clearthat he has taken time
to understand this university. In his remarks before the Senate. the community and in
private meetings he has shown the ﬁrmness that had been lacking here for the _past ﬁve
years. .

Of course. his position must reﬂect political as well as ad ministration inﬂuences. At

times he is deciding emotional and complicated issues, between segments of the '

university community. and- until he knows the proper action he must avoid
committments. At these times. he speaks arou‘nd issues and cannot always reveal-his
opinions. It is important that he prevent alienation or demoralization on campus.

Fields will encounter issues throughout the year. and some decisions may be tough.
The university should remember that an evaluation of SUNYA's president should not
rest on his actions in any one particular issue. An overview is essential and. as yet. is
impossible. '

Mohawk Tower,

Recently Student Association officials have approached the administration and
asked that Indian Quad‘s Mohawk Towcr be returned to dormitory status. It now
houses the offices of faculty members in Economics and Sociology. among others.
Fields. Vice President for Management and Planning .lohn Hartley and Dean of
Student Affairs Ncil Brown agreed to study such a proposal.

It would be difficult to makeu ﬁnal decision on the use of Mohawk Tower before the
October deadline for submission ofS UNYA‘s 1976-77 budget to SU NY Central. But if
projections ofstudent housing needs can be made in ti me. they should be. Fields should
make every effort to ﬁnd out ifthc conversion of Mohnwk Tower will still make sense
years hence. and ifit does make sense such it change must be reflcctcdjn the l976-77
budget. ‘ ‘

Hopefully the offices now in Mohawk 'l'owcr cant be moved without causing serious
faculty crowding. Draper Hull should have extra space next semester with the demise
of the Milne school and the James E. Allen Collegiate Center.

Mohawk was designed for students. and the direction of the ccono my does suggest
that student demand for dormitory space will hold up over the next few ycttrs. A
demand presently exists to fill Mohnwk Towcr. and a speedy transition will serve the
grctttcst number of Students.

And SA 

Student Association l’rcsidcnt Andy littumun. Vicc l’rcsid’ciil Rick Mccklcrund
Controller Sttt chin have shown a surprising nuiyity about administration politics
with their actions on the Mohawk Tower issue. Converting Mohnwk Tower back to
dormitory space is not it new idcu. but they have presented it to thcudministrttt ion only
weeks before S U N YA is required to submit its l976-77 budgct to SU NY Cent fit I. They
wanted at Mohawk conversion reflected in that budget. At a meeting SUNYA
l’rcsidcnt Fields agreed to look at the space priorities in Mohawk. Yet. the SA
executive brunch rclttrncd to SA‘S Central Council to stty that Fields is iltlli-SllldCltl.
Apparently Fields would have had to convert Mohawk Tower todorms thc dtty after
their meeting to satisfy the SA officials. Considering that SA could lttl\’L‘ broughttltis
proposal months ago and that Fields has done us much as could be c.\ pcctcd so fat r. the
comments the three student officials made to Council a bout Fields on this issue were
quite rush.

l)o Msst's. liuumun. Mccklcr and Klein want to embarrass Fields in his maiden
momh‘.’ ls littumttn dcspurutely looking fornn issue with which to make his mark on
this cn mpus'?

Surcly it doesn‘t make sense for Bttumttn to put his relations with the new
tulministrntion at stake so quickly. it is a disservice to all students to rail against the
ndminislmtion on Mohawk. thereby raising unwarranted sympathy for Fields and
ttntipttthy towards students.

SA‘s Central Council should be aware that the ncgtttivc impression of Fields they
may have received from the SA exec branch is unfounded. Fields is still a new
president. and it real perspective on him is months away.
