badly sprained ankle." said
Schieffelin. "Arthur Bedford has.
played an outstanding center
fullback'in Rose‘s place. (Bedford
would normally start at the right
fullback position)“

Schieffelin also said Obwald is in
the best shapehe has been in since his
freshman year.

“Henry has ﬁnally gotten off to
the kind of start We have always
hoped for.“ said Schieffelin. “His
timing isatmid-season form. and he
has made several outstanding saves.
although he has not faced a powerful
offense as of yet."

Overall. the team hasimprovcd its
teamwork and attitude miles beyond
that of last year.

“Ourpasswork is becoming very

efficient. almost automatic.” said

'Schieffelin. "fake Ruanb’a second
goal for example. Selca had the ball

and: drop-passed ' it, 'knowing‘ that
' Ruano _would_ be there. He never

looked. net/er' signaled Chepe in any
Way. and Chepe was ready for the
ball. That't the mark of a solid

7 team.”

However. Schieffelin struck a
cautioning note when he reminded
several fans that the team has yet to
face a strong opponent.

“Cortland will be the first test."
explained Schieffelin. “They are 4-0
in the conference. and while they
have not scored many goals, they are
as physically tough asany team we‘ll
see. and area fine defensive club. If
we get past that one. we face Oneon—
ta. Keene State. and Hamilton at
home starting the following
weekend. Then. everyone will really
know what we have."
