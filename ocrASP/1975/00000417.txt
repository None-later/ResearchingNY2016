FSA Is Still
In The Blue

by Stephen Dzlnanlts '

Turning away from prior periods
of ﬁnancial insecurity. SUNYA‘s
Faculty-Student Association (FSA)
is in the black for the second straight
year. according to FSA General
Manager E. Norbert Zahm.

Zahnt‘s annual report to the
membership. which will be dis-
tributed to the FSA Board of Direc-
tors at their meeting today. states
that FSA‘s net income from
operations for the fiscal year ending
June 30. i975 was $230.3”.

“It's tight." said Zahm. “but it‘s
reasonable.“ He indented that the
tttattcr was “subject to opinion“
depending on your definition of a
non-profit organiuition.

The report makes note of the fact
that “the years l972 and l973
produCed a total net loss of 5542.020
while the years I974 attd I975 show-
ed a $575,417 net income."

“We're getting adjusted," remark-
ed Zahm. “we're not going broke.“

Fewer Expenses

Zahm explained that the $230,318
figure reflects the deduction of cor-
porate and program expenses. These
expenses include programs such as
the Glen House. Mohawk Campus.
and the Student Loan Fund. The ac-
tual overall net operatingincomefor
the year was $305,268.

Zahm attributed the corporation‘s
recent success mostly to cutbacks on
expenses. “We became extremely
cost conscious." said Zahm. “We‘ve
let a lot of people go.“ Zahm added
that there was “not that much new
business.“ but that there had been
some “moderate price increases."

Last February FSA Board of
Directors voted an eight percent
board hike which they felt was need-
ed to keep them financially above
water. Subsequently. Central Coun-
cil withdrew a loan from FSA of
about $180,000 in protest of the
board hike. At that time Zahm war
not sure that FSA could endure
without eventually going “back to
the bank to borrow some of that
S | 80,000 again." Zahm stated that as
it turned out. he never had to. FSA
was able to pay off the loan without
financial assistance.

in the report the General Manager
otttlined the goal‘of FSA "to have
major functions support themselves
and ttot have any one support to an
extraordinary degree any other."

Cost Consciousness: FSA director E. Norbert Zahm attributes a large
part at FSA‘s recent iinanclsl success to expense cuts he has made.

Zahm said that in previous years tltc
food service (particularly meal cott-
tracts) supplied the income
necessary to cover losses in other
l’SA operations.

The overall net operating income.
according to Zahm’s report. “was
composed of 43.7% funds from food
service. 36.2% from investment and
other [Income from the stile of
property and interest on in-
vestments]. and 20.I% from aux-
iliary services [includes the
bookstore and vending(less soda)]."

“We really don‘t have a losing
unit.“ commented Zahm. .

Meal Money

The report shows that FSA netted
a total of$ l85.026incomefrom meal
contracts. the downtown Husted
cash cafeteria. the added Indian
Quad cash cafeteria and the soda
vending business (operated by food

- service).

Zahm was especially pleased with
the success of the soda vending
business. “i don't know what you
kids are doing with all that soda." he
remarked. “They [students] must be
washing their cars with it or
something.“

Zahm stressed that the $|85.026
invome is not such a big chunk of a
four million dollar operation. “it‘s

. hard to convince st udentsthat $l80.-
000 is ttot a lot of money." he added.

A wide range of managerial
criticism was leveled at SUNYA in
an audit report made public on Sept.
It: by the State Depanment of Audit
and Control. The audit reviewed
events from 1968 through May 3|.
I974. '

A major concern of the nttdit was
the average of ll.65 contact hours.
hours of direct faculty-student cott-
tzict in the classroom. tattgltt by
Albany faculty for the Fall. I973
semester. This was the lowest of tire
fottr SUNY university centers.
Presently the University lacks tiny
formal faculty workload standards.
The dcparttttcttt Chairpersons deter-
mine teaching workloads based on
typc of class. class size. and
obligatiotts of t he teachers to student
counseling, research. etc.

Administration Reacts To
State Department’s Audit

by Stephen Dormer
Calling the criticisms made in a
recently released State Department
audit of SUNYA "helpful." John
Hartley. Vice President of Manage-
ment and Planning. and Philip
Sirotkin. Vice President of
Aeadentic Affairs. said that the Un-
iversity will try to utilize several of
the report‘s recommendations.
However. both adtninistrators
feel that the report‘s criticism is not
an indication that SUNYA has been
grossly mismanaged.
' Standards Needed
One of the issues dealt with in the
audit report was the University‘s
lack of formal faculty workload
standards and tltc faculty‘s weekly
“contact.” or classroom hour
average of “.65, lowest ofthe four
university centers. Sirotkin
thinks this problem ltas been over-
simplified. The “contact hours" are
only one pan of a teacher's
workload. but it is the part that
sometimes is over-emphasized. For
example. a l973 study ofthe Biology
and Sociology departments here in-
dicated ait avorage of 55 hours per
week spend by tltc faculty in ac-
tivities related to. but outside of. the

SUNYA Police Increase Ticketing

by David Wlnzelberg

The University Police. working
overtime. served 689 parking tickets
on September 22. 'l‘lteticketing biill.
according to Assistant Director of
Security John Henighan. is part ofa
crackdown on the many vehicle
violators on campus.

Henighan said that usually two of-
liccrs are assigned to give out tickets
which amount to about 250 daily.
However in the one 24 hour period,
four additional officers worked an
extra four hours each in order to
reach the unusually large number of
Windshields.

Henighan reported that the over-
time pay for the period amounted to
approximately SISO. He pointed out
that “if you look at it economically"
the extra pay was a “good invest-
ment."

iiettigltatt stated that a large part
of the problem is the number of
vehicles that remain unregistered
with tltc University Police. l-ie es-
timated that “40% of tltc cars aren‘t
registered." Henigltan explained
that frequent violators can get towed
away adding that the towing charges
start at $20 "plus more for extras."

For refusing to pay a line. student
ticket scofilaws can be stopped front
registering and can be kept from
graduating. Faculty fine dodgers get
the penalties automatically taken
out of their cltecks.

Student Marion Kravitz found
her car victintiled by the ticketing
deluge that Monday, while parked in
the middle of the State Quad parking
lot. She said that she “looked for
signs but didn‘t see any“ when she
parked her car. Kravitz is appealing

 

the violation claiming that “certain
rows (iii the lot) don‘t even have any
signs.” A University Police map of
tltc State Quad lot shows tnost park.
ing signs itt place bttt also reveals
tltrcc areas witcre the signs are miss-
ing.

Kravitz‘s case is not uncommon.
ltt I974. l.2l7 appeals were ﬁled
yielding 822successf ul attempts. The
Appeals lioard is appointed by the
University Council and consists ofa
faculty member. a civil service
worker and a student.

Henighan asserted. "I will keep
people overj ust to enforce parking.“
He added that tlteticketing seigc will
continue for at least "a couple of
weeks" to encourage vehicle registra-
tion. while enforcing the law. He
said. in this way. "we are putting an
emphasis on the parking problem."

  

classroom.

The University still lacks formal
standards for teacher workload. but
Sirotkin ittdicatcd that it was an
extremely difficult matter to
legislate. even departmentally. The
University continues to use as its
guidelines in dealing with workloads
a general policy statement issued by
the Educational Policies Council of
the University Senate in l972.

The audit report discovered that
ill the 1973 Fall semester. classrooms
attd lecture trails were only used two~
thirds and laboratories two-fifths of
the available hours. Sirotkin
suggested that these statistics might
be due to the fact that the hours
between l0 um. and 2 pm. are the
most popular clttss hours. Many
departments therefore try to
schedule as few classes as possible
outside ofthose hours. knowingthat
many students shy away from early
and/or evening classes.

The audit reported that the Un-
iversity was plagued by a huge
backlog of uttcollccted student hills.
Hartley revealed that the school
ltas made sttbstatttial progress in
diminishing that backlog. As of
June. 1974.studenlsowcdtlteschotl
over two million dollars. and LS
million of that was overone semester
old. Presently. only $939,000 ofthat
two million is tutcollectcd. and
3710.000 of that has already been
forwarded to the attorney general
for collection. As of June. I975.$i.3
million was owed by students. a
sharp $800.000 redttction front the
backlog of o yea r earlier.

According to Hartley. the
backlog is deceptiver large. Since a
st udcttt can defer part of his bill has-
ed on student aid and loan
programs, the University must
sometimes wait over a yearto collect
truth the state and federal agencies
which provide this aid.

Strict directives have been issued
to rectify several practices criticized
by the auditors. especially the split-
ordering. which was uncovered in 14
instances. according to Hartley.
Split-ordering is the practice of split-
ting one purchase into several orders
to circumvent competitive bidding
requirements and give preference to

~ department. Then‘ the University

could utilize these standards byre-
quiring“department chairpersons to
submit justification for faculty
assigned a wot kload of lessthan the
standard“ for the department.

Through the Fall. i973 semester.
the University used classrooms an
average of 3 | .6 hours a week. lecture
halls 3|.8 hours a week. and
laboratories [9.7 hours a Week. The
report compared these averages with
the 50 hours available each week
dttrittg the day for scheduling
classes. The comparison revealed
that classrooms and lecture halls are
ttscd only about two-thirds and
laboratories about two-fifths of the
available 50 hours.

le'ttrthcrmorc. classroom seats
were used 22.5 hours a week and Ice-
ture hall seats lb.i hottrsa week. The
utiliration standard for both
classrooms attd lecture balls is 24
hours a week. showing tltc classroom
rate to he signigicantly below its
standard. In terms of student oc-
cupancy. tltc rcport showed that
one-fourth of classroom seats and
one-third of lecture ltall seats
remained unoccuppied during class
periods itt those rooms.

The report suggested that the Un-
iversity try to schedule itt classrooms
some of the smaller courses now
tattght in lecture halls. It might then
be possible to shutdown one or more
of the lecture halls and save their
maintenance costs.

Law Violation

The audit revealed that the Un-
iversity had violated state law by the
“split-ordering“ of purchases in i4
instances between l970 and [974.
This is the practice of splitting one
purchase into several orders to cir-
eomvent competitive bidding re-
quirements ttnd give preference to a
particular sales firm. Apparently no
legal action has been taken. but the
University has agreed to disdain
from this practice in the future.

As of June 30. I974. University
records showed that students owed
$2.l H.343. all but $504. “)9 ofwhieh
was due for semesters prior to the
Spring. I974 semester. The official
policy of the State University‘s Cen-
tral Council is that students must
resolve their accounts either by pay—
ment or deferral based on
acknowledged student aid
programs. “'l'ltcrci'orc." says the
report, “there should ltavc been no
delinquent accounts.“ However. the
report states that lit many delinquent
accounts. paymcttt ltad been
deferred on the basis of unrecogniz-
ed student aid and authentic
