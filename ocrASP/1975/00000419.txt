Representation

' by Edward Moser

Malcom Sherman is a math
professor who believes: -. students
should be denied representation on
the University Senate. He has much
to say on why he feels this should be
so.

Sherman thinks the Senate's stu-
dent membership prevents the facul-
ty repr'esentationrfrom having any
meaningful say in Senate ‘affairs.
Says Sherman. “The presence of
students inhibits the faculty from
speaking its own mind . . . they're
(the profs) afraid of bad student
reaction . . .“

“ .  The students in the Senate
are politicians who want to build a
record‘for their constituencies, so
that they can run for other offices."
Thus. feels Sherman, students bring
up issues not really meant forSenate
consideration. He compared student
Senators seeking more school
holidays andu-dagofbonorre-

sasu President Bob «Kim:

quirernentt to “union leadtit‘s trying ,
to‘g'et’pay relies.” The suntrelfect of I
these student efforts. feels Sherman.
is that the “faculty is prejtented from
dealing with issues of academic con-
cern." ‘ -

Sherman says that. unlike student
Senate reps. who often congregate
together and make plans at SA and
Central Council. faculty members of
the Senate seldom see each other
outside of their organization‘s
meetings. Claims Sherman. “They
don't have the time to deal with the
nitty-gritty part -of issues except
within the Senate itself . . if the
faculty are to have a sufﬁcient role
(in University government). they
must work within is structured.
ongoing organization.“

Sherman is also upset that the
“faculty Senate members have little
influence on how votes turn out.“
Sherman says the administration

NYPIRG Makes {Plans for

by Judy Jaeger

The New York Public Interest
Research Group (NYI’IRG) held its
fall conference in Syracuse this
weekend. where students from eight
colleges throughout the state dis-
cussed plans for the coming
semester.

The colleges represented included
SUNYA. SUNY at Buffalo. SUNY
at Stony Brook. SUNY at Bingham-
ton. 5th at New Paltz. Queens
College. Syracuse University. and
Colgate University.

Topics discussed included the

ERA. Nuclcnr power.thc banning of

non-rcturnnblc bottles, the

Educations Testing Service (ETS),
marijuana rcforrn. campus voter
registration drives. utility rate
rcform.- and various consumer
protection issues.

Students and staff members of
NYi’lRG began arriving late on Fri-
day. and were provided with lux-
urious accommodations on the floor
of the girls' gym.

The conference was held in the
University‘s oldest building. when:
everyone met at 8:30 on Saturday
morning for coffee and donuts.

Business began with a general
meeting where Donald Ross. a
former employee of Ralph Nader

often split over an issue“. and this‘
division forfeits a good part of its
voting punch. . _

Also. Sherman dislikes the fact
that students help determine policy
(the Senate has little real power. but
the administration often follows its
advice) on issues where there is sup-
posedly a conflict of interest. As ex-
amples of this he cited Senatediscus-
sion of 'gra'de inflation‘ and degree
requirements. two issues of student
concem.

As an answer to these problems.
Sherman wants the faculty.which he
said must each year approve the
Senate‘s by laws to prohibit student
Senate membership. Students could
still serve on Senate committees. ac-
co'r‘d'lng t‘o Sherman's plan.

Sherman feels his proposal is only
fair. He poses the question. “How
would students feel ifthcadministra-

SASU Meets

by Randi B. Toler

The Student Association of the
State University of New York
(SASU) met last \\'cckcnd at the

SASl.I delegates. radio and press

Sherman is confident his ideas will
win out. He says that a year ago.
when the question of student
membership was brought up in the

that S U N Y is going to raise the room
rates. Warren replied. "ldon‘t think
they‘d have the nerve to raise the
room rates upstate when the city
schools have no tuition.“

Warren was rclcctaut to talk
about the budget. particularly when
pressed on the issue ofthc refurbish-
ment of the I) and H ffice
Buildings which will house new of—
fices for SUNY executives. Wurrcn
turned the tables around and
questioned the students. The Vice

and renowned. group. “A citizen ac—

he said. “to see wore the most

Richard Sokolow. a student from
SUNY Buffalo then spoke on
NYI’lRG‘s role on campus. He
noted the large amount of intellec-
tual energy on college campuses and
felt that NYPlRG'sjobistofunnel it
to practical use. “You go through

twelve years of school to learn to

teaches you how to do."

With these words of wisdom and
encouragement. students attended

Multiple Interests

SASU President Bob Kirkpatrick

lloard of 'l'rustccs and soon after -
attcnded his first board meeting. At
the media conference. Warren
playfully \vnrucd Kirkpatrick that lie
wottl now have to concern himself
with' c interests of both the board
and the students. Upon Warren's
departure. Kirkpatrick stated to the
reporters “If I become convinced
that sludcnfs do not care if there isa
$ltltlor $200 raise in tuitionthen I'm .
in the wrong position.“ .

Russ (iugino. Administrative
Assistant to the Vice Chancellor for
University Affairs. also spoke to the
media representatives. He stressed {
that his office is always willing to 5

student press conferences to be eld

Gugino told the reporters that. 1
