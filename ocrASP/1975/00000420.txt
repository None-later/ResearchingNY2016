Aspin reports that the Air Force has '7
_ just spend $65 million for bomb
V shelters for its new tactical aircraft. ‘

but that two of the new planes are

too big to fit into the shelters.

' seaming isn't can?

The new F-IS is reportedlyat least
eight inches too tall for the new
bomb shelters, while the A-lO is
several feet too wide.

Aspin says the Pentagon plans to
correct the situation by modifying
existing shelters or building new
ones.

The new bomb shelter plans. the
Congressman says. are expected to
cost American taxpayers another
$64 million. Says A’prin: “Taxpayers
need a shelter of their own from Air
Force ‘bombs' like this."

which surfaced during the Watergate
investigation in I973. -

Robert Reisner. a campaign assis-

that he had been instrumental in
stopping G. Gordon Liddy from kill-
ing Anderson.

As Reisner tells it. he encountered
Liddy in the hall of CREEP head-
quarters as Liddy was leaving theol-
ﬁce of Jeb Stewart Magmder.
Reisner says that Liddy announced
“I've just been ordered to kill’Jack
Anderson."

Reisner says he ran into

Middle Earth Stays

by Amy S. Cohen
Ever find yourself half way
between Albany and The University
of Miami during Christmas vacation
on yt or way to visit your best bud-
dy? Somewhere in the middle of
Georgia your eyes are
News closing, and your feet
are dragging and you
Feature just keep wishing you
had someplace to stop
for the night. Middle Earth, on on
campus consoling service. has set up
a program for people in this areathat
lind themselves in the same predica-
mcnt. Hill Vitous. a fourth year doc-
toral candidate in clinical psy-
chology who counsels for Middle
Earth. said that the program was in-
stituted for “normal, middle class
folk who are just passing through."
About 20-25 people have
volunteered their services. but Mid-
dlc Earth is looking for additional
interested students so as not to in-
convenience the same people too
often. All that is required from the

students who sign up is an extra bed.
a sleeping bag. or even just a floor.
Basically all that is needed is a roof
and a dry ground.

'I’hc system is not without itsl‘nults
and the people in charge ol'it arc tak-
ing precautions with the people they
agree to put up. Someone front Mid-
dlc Ea rlh must see anyone who asks
for a place to stay. No one will be
placed over the phone. The ncttt step
is a screening process whereby train-
ed counselors. usually graduate
students who have had some prac-
tical experience in addition to their
schooling, just rap with the people
who come in. They form an overall
impression. Sometimes thcyjust ask
people to stick around the Middle
Earth ofﬁce until thcycomc down.
but more often they don‘t have to
and they find a place for them. The
basic rule of operation is.“Don't
crash somebody you wouldn‘t crash
in your own house.“

Middle Earth has been trying to
remain in touch with the community

“Organizations (such as APRO)
should be watched because of their
potentially great influence on mass

from a mere referral and counseling

Students expressed an interest in
