_ OCTOBER 3, 1975

 

 

by Lon Levin .

There are many major television
ratings. Some are pro-industry and
some are ttccurntc. The two major
ones are the Neilson, which quizzes
1200 people each week on what they
watch and the ARB (American
Research Bureau) which asks 75.000
people which show they are viewing
each week.

The networks tind working with
the ratings system a relatively easy
task. Unfortunately they can not rely
on people to send in their views on
shows so. in turn. they go out to us.
The networks encourage this type of
behavior. They don‘t want responsi-
ble interested citizens telling thctn
what to do. With every letter. they
listen and worry but still do not act
on it. So the public gets frustrutcd
and stops writing.

The attitude of “don't call us. we'll
call you." holds for the national
networks. This is because they have
no license to lose. Only the i11-
dividual stations get licenses. They
have to listen because ifenouglt peo-
ple do not want them on thcttir. their
license can be revoked. If the FCC
gets enough legitimate complaints.
the station may not be around
anymore.

Now. this brings us to the matter
of what we can do. Below urea list of
the programming director's ad-
dresses for the SUNYA area.

Well-Preserved Grandeur.

 

The grandeur of ancient Rome

was by no means limited to the
Eternal City itself: rather it was
reﬂected in countless outposts of
Roman civilimtion from North
America to Britain and from Spain

to the Near East. During the Roman
period there were three great centers
of urban life in the Near East:
Palmyra in Syria. Petra in southern
Jordan (see the ASI’ of February l4.
I975). and .lcrush in northern

Jordon. Each of the three is unique
in'its own way. Jcrash. Gerusa in
antiquity. is the most typical and
best preschcd example ofa Roman
provincial town in the Near East. It
is located in a well-watered valley in
the Biblical land of Gilead. lt fell
under Roman rul in 63 ll.C. when
Pompey incorporated the entire
Palestine~Syritt area into the Roman
Empire.

Jerash ﬂourished in the security of
the great Pax Rmmma. Building
projects of the first century AD.
ipcluded the city walls. temples to
Zeus and Artemis. among others.
baths. theaters. and a splendid
forum: the latter isabsolutely unique
in architectural history by its
peculiar oval shape. In the second
century AD. the temples to Zeus
and Artemis were torn down and
rebuilt on a grander scale. the streets
were widened. a numphacum was
added. and a triumphal arch was
erected to commemorate a visit by
the emperor Hadrian. Local stone
was .supplemented by marble
imported from Asia Minor and by
granite imported form the Aswan
area of Egypt. Even in its ruinous
state Jerash suggests the level of
comfort once enjoyed by its
residents.

The decline of Jerash began in the
third century and continued through
the Christian era although the city
was the seat of a bishop and
numerous churches were built. The
decline of the city picked up speed
after the Moslcm conquest inabout
636 and after several ca rthquakes in
the eighth century. From the l3th to
the trim century the site was
unoccupied — a fortunate
circumstance from the
archaeologist‘s point of view.

.lcrash was rediscovered in l806,
morethan half buried in rubble and
sand. Many columns at Jerash show
by their coloration how farthey were
buried and othersttre still more than
half hidder’t from view. In "178 the
Turkish government established 9
village hercand settled it mostly with
Circassians. Circasliana. a unall
ethnic group. had been persecuted in
Czarist Russia because of their
Modem faith and were being
resettled by the Turks. A vilitor to
Jerastt in lti9| =deecribed how the
Circauiant leveled column after
