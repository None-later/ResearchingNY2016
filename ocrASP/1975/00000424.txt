“The National lampoon Show”
opens With the six cast members
(four males and two females) doing
an energetic songand dance number,
the message of which goes like this:
ﬁWe don‘t give 'a shit about you.
we're inithis for the money; we don't
give a shit about whether you're hav-
ing a good time, cause we are.” And
it shows. The show his great disap-
pointment.

The Lampoon show. which played
at Troy‘s Proctor Theater last week
and which will be making its way to
this campus November 7. is their se-
eortd stage show since the Lampoon

boom three years ago that
quadrupled sales. The Poonies have
recently extended their octopus-like
tentacles into records, films. radio.
posters. and special issues. proving
that there are a hell of a lot more
things to laugh about than we
thought. Even without Nixon.

The Lampoon people. though
never paragons of good taste. have
always been intelligent. clever, and
full of insight. Tlte Lampoon show,
however. is just plain vulger. The
show consts of about two dozen
skits. sketches, bits. and songs that
occasionally make us laugh but rare-
ly make us think. The program notes

 technical compounds like “mother-

The show usesm lot of funny

favorites as “cunt.” “shit.” “asshole.”
“prick.” “tits,” “dildo,” and more

guaranteed to effect waves of
laughter at their mere utterance.
Oddly enough. even though the
show‘s material is unrelenting in ite ‘

sneaking to the library to look up all
those words in the big dictionary.
Make no mistake—the show's
vocabulary isn‘t offensive~—juet
tedious.

In all fairness. thcrcare acouple of
good bits in the show, the best one
being a song by Watergate convicts

Dean, who. wielding golf clubs and

pagne and wait two days for laundry
in their low-security prison. But the
good bits are outnumbered twelve to
one by the sludge. "The National
Lampoon Show“ simply lacks the
bite, the vigor, and ther integrity of
the magazine. or, better still, “Lem-
mings.” their last show that was a

extremely witty and well-written and

hardly worth the price of admission.

' e Weekend caught

inhabited’ ski lodge between

teen or so people who had oneaim—
tranquility. And 'it was. incredibly
fulfilled throughout the day we have
been. here.

We arrived early in the morning
with the sunrise. The azure sky
enveloped us and dispelled the
fcoldness one feels at dawn. Our
dwelling exuded a kind of warmth;
helping‘ to bridge the gap between
the cold dunkness ofthe city and the
mystery of the forest. We immediate-
ly experienced a communion with
nature; not overwhelming brtt com-
forting. And it ﬁlled us with
calmness. All 0qu became friends, if
only for this brief experience.

The lodge. located on the slope of
a mountain. is surrounded by similar
dwellings. All blend amazingly well
into the foliage and the sense ofcom-
munityisevident.Themountain.ap-
proximately 2.000 feet high,. is a
steep precipice which is now affected
by the changing hues of the dying
leaves. The colors; reds. yellows and
golds frame the mountainside and
We feel a strange appreciation of
nature like few of us have ever felt
before.

The foliage is breathtaking as we

waves of nature creep over us..The
intense yet relaxod fatigue which we

All our daily stnrggles seem dis-
tant and we feel little except the
satisfaction which we have attained
through our physical exertion. Our
emotipns lose the complexity they
have acquired in tbecity and welind
contentment in the simple things.
The twilight and early evening also
take on this demeanor. Sitting
around a large table. we satiate our
ravenous appetites in a large feast of

’ spaghetti, with all the trappings. All
else seems so trivial compared to the
enjoyment we derive from this
secluded setting. The fire crackles in

the lodge and the entire mountain
setting. But the memories we will
have of this beautiful weekend in

Vermont will be a part of us for it

long time.

experience somehow makes it all'

Emmanuolle:  

by Jeanne Salewltz . g

This weekend Tower East is
presenting “Emmannuelle.” a
French film and Tower East‘s first
X-nited ﬁlm of the year.

If you‘re expecting an evening of
torrid love scenes from “Emman-
nuclle." don‘t bother seeing it. if
you‘re looking for strictly physical
stimulation. don‘t see “Emman-
nucllc.“ Don‘t let the X-rating tltrow
you: “limmannuellc” is a delicately
constructed piece. beautiful to look
at and aesthetically pleasing to the
senses.

"Emmanmrclle" isthe story ofthat
title character‘s journey from the in-
nocence and pretentiousncss of
girlhood to the soreness and self-
awareness of womanhood. A young
wife thrust into her husband‘s rather
sensuous circle of friends. limman—
nuelle is forced to decide whether to
retain ltcr own sketchy ideals and re-
main estrnngcd from the group or to
open herself to the seemingly banal
inﬂuences of that group.

She chooses the latter: in effect.
she is throwing offthe societal sanc-
tirnony of forced virginal purity. The
experiences that follow. including an
introduction to masturbation. anal

intercourse. and an involved lesbian
affair, make up the bulk of the'plot
and Emmannuelle‘s eventual
metamorphosis. Sylvia Kristel, a
luscious wide-eyed Wa if. is fresh and
lovely as E-mmannueile. although
her carnal scenes are by far her most
vibrant ones. i

The film‘s director. Just Jaeckin.
has created some marvelously
beautiful effects thr'ough the use of
soft-focus lenses and ﬂuid camera
movement. The results are muted.
almost translucent scenesand a gen-
tlc flowing from shot to shot.
creating an expressionistic dream-
world effect. Augmenting the serr-
sual beauty of the visuals is an ab-
solutcly exquisite musical score.
written by Pierre Bachclct. The
magical combination of .lacckin‘s
camera work and the smooth sound-
track is enough to entrance arty
viewer.

“limmannucllc” is sensual. rather
thanjust sexual. While it is noll'anti-
ly entertainment. it does have an at r-
listic style and sophistication not
found in most pornographic ﬁlms.
“limmannuellc” is tltc thinking
moviegoer's pomography: it is
aesthetic. intelligent and artistic.
