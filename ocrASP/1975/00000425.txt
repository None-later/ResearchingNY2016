they have given up some ,of the
a freedom‘of, expression that was an‘
important factor in the excellence of

orchestrated pop style. Second Step
is too slick. too overproduced for the
space in time that Altcc Two-Step is
in now. They might grow into that
musical level‘of swelling strings and
horns, but at the moment it is just

aromas usual Roi Fowkria the
dominaht writer. and; he proves
himself again and again to be ex-.
tremer talented and in washout of
the language and the rude. He has a
sense of humor that constantly
shows. from the never-neverhntl of
“Humpty Dumpty" to the rather
eccentric Indy love of “Faster Gun"—
“Now you ask me if she lovesmeand
you know I never lie/ She'll tease me

 
   

and she‘ll roan sue. thijse holds

OftII othersongs, two tint stand
out are 'lt's Going On Saturday"
(they opened their recent concert in
Albany with this song), and ‘ Hey
LittJe' Mann." These are both. up-
tempo, Iiveiy songs that ranain in
your' head and you find yourself
humming them long afterwards.

cause it takes time to grow ... Well

.you can do what you want] No it's

not like.Vermont in New York / But ‘
if you value your life/ Carry a gun '

and a knife and a fork . . .“

Second Step isjust that. A second
step for the team of Rex Fowler and
Neal Shulman. A very welcome and
musically rewarding step, both for
them and for theiraudience. Perhaps
they will win some of the commercial
popularity that they seem to want.
Hopefully they will not forget their
old audience in the rush. Only their
third step will tell.
