Living With the

Second Amendment

‘ ' L, Gordon Karp

President Ford has made it clear that he in-
tends to keep right on mingling. Dialogue with
the American people our first unelected presi-
dent contends. is of the utmost importance in
ottr society. The man has been shot at twice in
three weeks. So we have a problem. The issue

is not how to catalogue all the nuts who live in.

the ﬁfty states, or what the Secret Service can
do about them. The issue is. as it always has
been. gun control.

Granted. there is some truth to the
overworked phrase: guns don't kill people.
people do. But people with guns kill people a
lot more easily than people without guns.
Should something be done to control the
number of illegally possessed handguns in the
United States? You bet. And it would protect
you and me just as much as .lerry Ford. Not
that I expect a half hour of network coverage
when someone takes a shot at me. but I do
want help. Let‘s put an end to the kind of
entertainment that the Saturday night special
has made the longest running hit in the history
of American Street Theatre.

And now to the conservativesand free liber-
tarians l hear breathing'down my neck. Yes. I
believe in the Bill of Rights and ldon‘t want to
Ice them voided by acts ofCongress. Like it or
“oh you. me and the second amendment can
all be healthy at the same time. Just tO be clear.
here's the second amendment. in its entirety: A
well regulated militia. being necessary to the
mnrity of afree state. the right of the people
I0 keep and bear arms. shat/net be infringed.
. Note the intent of the amendment and then
3'“ anyone: which well regulated militia W88

f- sofa Jane Moore associated with? To play

t

with semantics in a far more substantttvc
sense. regulation is not a synonym for prohibi-
tion. There are many types of regulations
which do not infringe upon your right to
possess the good being regulated. The
Massachusetts Bartlcy-Fox act. for instance.
applies only to illegallyowncd handguns being
carried outside the owner's home.

We have delegated to various agencies of
the several levels of government the very
desirable end of protecting us from the
capricious and dangerous acts of others. Gun
control is merely a necessary and appropriate
means of achieving that end. it violates none
of the rights secured to use in the ﬁrst ten
amendments.

Imagine a contemporary constitutional
convention at which all levels of government
would undoubtably have delegates. An
amendment like the followingwould probably
result: Elliot‘ent personal transportation. be-
ing necessary to the p rosperity of a free state,
the right of people to own and operate
automobiles. shall not be infringed.

Would such an amendment prohibit the
government from registering automobiles to
prevent trafficking in stolen cars and to make
it possible to apprehend drivers who leave the
scene of an accident? Surely not. And so It
should go with registering or in some other
manner regulating handguns.

The Bartley-Fox Bill should serve as an ex-
ample not only to the states. but to the federal
government as well. There are ways to control
the number of illegally possessed handguns In
America that will peacefully coexist with the
second amendment.

 

A bill is presently on its wayto Student Association's Central Council that would set L
WSUA‘s budget for next semester at a 'bare minimum. Though the conversion of
WSUA from an on-campus carrier current station to l0-watt FM stereo is univenally
acclaimed to be desirable. it seems that fulﬁllment of that goal has become secondary
to debate about the present budget. -'

That debate stems from WSUA's lack of credibility. It is understandable that
students ﬁnd it difﬁcult to believe that WSUA will go FM when station managers have
been-"ﬁlling SA for ﬁve years that they would “soon” go FM. However. the FM
application had never left the station until this past summer. The present delays within
the university are not unexpected; with some pressure the application should beat the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in a few weeks. Assuming the FCC
approves. WSUA will be FM within a year. So now is the time for WSUA. SA. the
students and the rest of the university to work their utmost to obtain for WSUA the
new status.

Instead. it appears that SA and WSUA have taken adversary roles. Student
Association's executive branch worked out a"shoestring“rbudget for WSUA‘s spring
semester slicing more than a third of their fall appropriation. and there was talk about a
zero budget. Some WSUA officials reported that the sports department was asked to
support the contention that they were the only part of WSUA worth funding. WSUA
threatened to withdraw their FM application iftoo manycuts were made. And so on.

Threats to Withdraw the FM applicationfor any reason represent a lack of sincere
interest in the students. Waving a sword at the radio station's budget is the wrong
attitude for the SA exec branch. Instead. both WSUA and SA must take a greater
interest in the higher goal. serving students. This may have already started. since
WSUA and the SA exec branch have begun talks to work out next semester‘s funding.

WSUA would probably be willing to cut about twenty per cent of their fall
appropriation for the spring semester. and the Central Council will probably vote a
figure near that. That appropriation would be made with the expectation that the FM
application will be approved, a reasonable conclusion. if. however. WSUA cannot go
FM, the station should be disbanded.

WSUA‘s inadequacies are inherent. not the result of bad staff or programming. The
station is. in its present state. limited to less than half the student body since it
broadcasts on-campus only. Its reception is poor because it is carrier current. and not
stereo. Though the station itself has improved so that it is comparable to any stationin
the region. its listenership will always be low. Sports. news and the most innovative
special programs will not make up for the lack ofa music listening base. WSUA AM
costs too much in money. time and space for the service it provides. Without PM it still

may be possible to retain the training function for future professionals. but it is nOt
worth keeping up the quad transmitters for that.

Indeed, it isn‘t sensible to make any thousand-dollar repairs on the AM equipment
this spring. if there is a major breakdown. the station should limp its way to FM. Of
course. it is more important to go FM than to save money. so if there would be
complications from the FCC about grantinga FM license toa non-functioning station,
care should be taken to keep the station operating.

Student pressure and impatience with WSUA was expressed last spring from Rick
Meckler‘s special Central Council committee. Meckler. now SA Vice President.
"scared" the station into gettingits application out. Now that the station has started the
application process, however. efforts should be directed primarily to further it.

PM is on its way. and if it isn’t. WSUA is on the way out.
