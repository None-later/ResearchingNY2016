Chavez forgotten?

To the Editor:

What could be a greater display ofapathy
than the number of students who attended the
recent meeting that was held in the CC ﬁreside

'fireside lounge forall students interested in the
plight of the farmworkers in this country? A
total of six students showed up to show their
concern for a group of people who have been
harassed and discriminated against for years.
Where were the rest of the concerned students?
Were they too busy to attend the meeting?
Surely they could have spared one hour of
their time to help the people who pick the
grapes and lettuce we eatand whom to this day
remain grossly underpaid with too few
beneﬁts.

An hour-long movie describing the U.F.W.
(United Farm Workers). their leader Cesar
Chavez, and their goals will be shown soon on
campus. Let‘s hope more people show up for it
than did for the discussion.

this past weekend certainly was a bright spot
for the Albany university community. One
simple question I ask? Why was not one word
mentioned in Tuesday's Albany Student Press
concerning this past weekend?

The ASP is a publication responsive to and
responsible to the people of this school. Cer-
tainly a small space on some page could have
been reserved to give the students of this un-

Wong Wronged

To the Editor:

This is the story of a little guy getting it from
the big guy.

I‘m the little guy. Bob Wong. Editor-in;
Chief of the student handbook: Viewpoinl 75-
76. This year I changed the book into
somethingl felt is more informative. readable
and impressive in style. I accomplished this

' despite beginning with no staff at all and no of»

fices to keep the huge amount of materials re-
quired to publish a book. Somehow I put
together a very dedicated com petentstaff. and
working in Iransia thru finals and part of the
summer we completed our task. A
Throughout all of this work. none of my
staff received any compensation fortheirtime
and hard work. When it came to compose the

book. the summer was here and I had two op- .

tions. Either compose the book professionally
at twenty dollars a page or use the ASPcom~
position services. As the ASP was faster.
cheaper and of equal if not better quality than
a pro‘s the choice was obvious.

However there is a catch.. . Composition
workers are students and students tend to go
home for the summer. I managed to persuade
some ofthese skilled workers to remain paying
them as we have done in the past two dollars
an hour.

This is where the big guy, our Student
Association. starts to pressure the little guy.
SA refuscdto allow Vlewpot’ntto pay the com-
position workers for their time. Only after
some debate did they agree with us. But they
refused to pay for my composition services.
And this point they have been most finnon.

at "your Student Association” as l have yet to

What it comes down to is this. I have receiv-

cooperation of SA. To do so would require

another superlative effort on my part.‘

something that looks totally unattractive due
to the demeaning way SA is handling the af-
fair. At thistime there is no staff. editor or per-

technical experience to put together another

entering SUNY-Albany who will be hurt.
there is a strong possibility that there will not
beanother Viewpoint next year.

Unorganized Football

To the Editor:

We. the members of “Vinnies.” feel that
the Women‘s Intramural Recreational
Association is very inefficiently organized in
conjunction with women‘s flag football.

The rules were not presented in a clear
manner to the teams or to the officials. This
was evident when officials were forced to con-
sult the rule book too much. and when of-
ﬁcials were not sure which official was sup-
posed to call certain penalties. Thc WIRA has
been negligent in assuring the teams that
referees would be at each game. A game
should not be scheduled without scheduling

‘ arch actor . .
Ila football gamésare called off due to lack of
elite all? » ' ‘ ‘

 The one and only, “fielle is not always ade- 7

quater prepared for flag'fo‘otball games. For

example. on Sunday. September 28. agame

~ was scheduled for, .30 p.m.'The field was still

lined for field hockey; The ofﬁcials were not .
aware that the field was not properly prepared
for the game. This alone is inexcusable!

The goal markers for women's flag football

' have consisted of swoatshirts and jackets ob-

tained from the members of the teams that are
playing. The men have bright orange cones to
mark their goal lines. We feel that the women's
teams should also have some type of bright

' markers to differentiate the goal lines.

Whereas in men's flag football. the teams
received a full, page of penaliiesand the severi-
ty of each. we women have no such list. All we
were told was that we shouldn‘t woi'ry about
most of them. Since the beginning of our
games. we have been called for a number of
different offenses. most of which we were

" given 5 yards for. We feel that it is unfair that

we don‘t know'what exactly will be culled as a
penalty. and how severe it will be. We. too.
should have received a list for us and our of-
ﬁcials to follow instead of leaving it up to the
discretion of the official as to whether rou-
ghing should be called in a girls‘ game.

We Would also like to protest one rule. This
is the “whistle rule“ which says that when the
ball is hiked. no onecun move until the whistle
is blown. 'i'hcorcticully. thc whistle is blown us
the quarterback receives the ball. In practivc.
the whistle is often slow. which hurts the cf-
l'icicncy of the offensive terms.

We feel that there has been unsportsman-
like conduct on the pa rt of all teams. A great
deal of this has bccncnuscd by confusion and
ignorance. This could be resolved by increased
organization and cooperation from the
WIRA. the officials. and all the women in the
womcns‘lllag football league.
