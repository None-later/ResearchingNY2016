Ting“ ' “ A . ‘
Daneicoaeb Bob Ford readily ad-
its that Albany is a superior
ballclub but adds “we can‘t afford a
week'of non-growth."

“We got away with alot of mis-

’ » takes lastiWeek‘ the kind which we
won‘t be able to get away with when.

we come up against the tougher op-
ponents on our schedule."

RIT meanwhile has been having
its problems. They lost their season
opener to Hobart college and were
destroyed last week by St. Lawrence
College. 56-0.

Young Team

The Tigers are basically a young
team with u lot of freshmen and
sophomores in the starting lineup,
according to Ford. Since they are so
young, Ford expects them to im-
prove with the season.

Their offense revolves around the
right arm of quarterback l’aul
Adamo.

Adamo connected on lb of 35
passes last week for i62 yards and is
the second leading passer in Division
III of the NCAA. He averages 17
completions a game.

His favorite target is split end Al
Lentz. Lentz burned St. Lawrence
last week for eight catches [for 74
yards and is the leading pass receiver
in Division ill with l8 receptions.

Ford‘s scouting reports back up
what Rl'l‘s previous scores seem to
indicate: their running game is not
very sound (last week they managed
minus one yard rushing forthc entire
game).

“Their backs are small and only

 

very basic. Their blocking is not con~

sistent, reducing the effectiveness of
their running game. but they do give ,
the quarterback excellent pass

protection."

“We'll give them different looks in
the defensive secondary, and double
and triple Lentr. if we have to“, said
Ford. Adamo has a quick release
and is tough to get to, but we‘ll mix
up our defensive alignments and
hope to gel to him on occasion.“

0n offense the Danes will be try-
ing to eliminate foolish penaltiesand
striving for consistency. offensively.

Albany finally got the big offen-
sive machine rolling as they churned
out 549 total yards last week against
Brockport.

Orin Griffin. who led the ground
game with 235 yards gained in only
one half of play, was named ECAC
Division ill co-playcr of the week.

Once again Albany will try to es-
tablish the inside power game.

Ford‘s Philosophy

“Once they respect us inside it
opens it up for us to get outside",
said Ford. “The inside game will be
in the hands of Tom DcBlois ifhe is
physically able. DcBlois is going to
see the doctor and if he feels that the
week off will help his toe that much.
then he won‘t play“.

Either Bill Rugglcs or Mike
Mirabello could be in Delilois‘ spot
eomc Saturday.

if the Danes have a prohlcnl that
needs to be solved, it is the halfback
spot left vacant by the injured (ilenn
Sowalskic.'|'irn Ridgcway did a fine
job last week but has been sick all

performer, is not available and Roy

Otherwise the offense: is in good

ends Bob Baxter, Don Whitley; and

Ford is conﬁdent that the offense

will have no problem moving the ball ,.

against RIT either inside. outside, or
through the air.

Defensiver injuries may hurt the
Danes, at both tacltle spots.

Jim “’l‘iny“ Holloway is nursinga
severely sprained ankle and will miss
the game. Frank Villanova is doubt-
ful as he is still bothered by a nagging
shoulder injury.

Art Joiner and Jose Vido will be
called on to plug the holes left bythe
injuries. ’

Analysis: This is an important
game for the Danes. After Satur-
day‘s game, the Danes have a week
off. Then it‘s off to New Haven to
tangle with Southern Connecticut
before coming home to clash with
Norwich and Albright.

Albany must eliminate the
penalties and mistakes which have
characterized the season so far.

in short, Albany most consistently
play the superior football they have
shown only flashes of so far.

The game begins at l:30 and will
be broadcast live over wsun—mo
on the AM dial.

Hoop Tryouts

'l'ryouts for the varsity andjunior
varsity basketball teams are
scheduled to begin October IS in
