The Albany State varsity soccer
team faces its lint major challenge of
the young season whenthey meet the
Cortland Red Dragons-under the
lights at 7:30 p.m. in Cortland. in a
game to be broadcast live over
WSUA-MO AM.

Albany is ranked 3-0. ninthin the
State. 1-0 in State University of New
York Athletic Conference play.
while Cortland is number eight. 4-0,
3-0 in the Conference. .

Last year the teams playedto a 0-0
tie in Albany. and according to
Danes' Coach Bill Schieffelin. this
year's meeting of the “undefeated”
promises to be another well-played.
physical contest.

“They have a very consistent
team." said Schieffelin. The most im-
portant comment I can offer is that
Cortland has not played poorly .
against a good team during the past
few seasonsi"

Last year the Red Dragons were
undefeated in SUNYAC play. in-
ciuding an upset, 2-0. win over
Brockport. More importantly, one
loss was enough to drop Albany into
third place in the Conference last

year. beltind Oneonta and Cortland. .

“They have not given up more

than two goals in one game in the
past two seasons,” Schieffelin said.
“Balancing that is that they are es-
sentially. a low-scoring club.”
" The Red Dragons visited RPI last
week. and went home, l-0. winners
thanks to a defensive mistake by the
'Eny'neers. Albany downed RPll
in their season opener two ':

ago.

“Don‘t interpret ‘that to mean
more than a win." said Schieffelin.
"For some stranp reason. Cortland
has always had trouble with RPI.

Albany's tdask emban- reaclsal for mortise”.

J Ninth-Ranked Boaters Face

The old idea that we won, 670. and
Cortland won. l-0. so we should beat
Cortland, 5-0. is absolutely
ridiculous."

The Boaters have not played un-
der the lights before, and Schieffelin
hopes that this will not be a serious
disadvantage.

“We‘ll get therewell in advance of
the game. and we‘ll head out to the
ﬁeld early so we can pick out the
poorly lighted areas," explained
Schieffelin. “I am more concerned
with the home ﬁeld advantage than'
the time of ti.. game.”

Cortland Solid

According to Schieffelin. Cor-
tland is a team of solid players who
match-up well with Albany. The
lone standout is Jim Jordan. a
member or the l974 All New York
State soccer team.

“This is a very big game for both
clubs.“ said Schieffelin. “We are
ranked ninth in the state. they are
number eight. Both of us are un~
defeated in the Conference, and last
year. one loss was enough to drop us
down to a tie for third place behind
Cortland a‘nd Brockport." -

The Boaters will go with Henry
Obwald in the net. and a front line of

Chepe Ruano. Matty Denora.
Frank Selca. and Pasquale Petric-
cione.

“We have the momentum as far as
the scoring end of it is cornered."
said Schieffelin. “We've scored lfl
goals in 3 games. and allowed one, so
offensively I believe we have an'
edge."

The defensive alignment depends

' very much on the ankle of center

fullback Ricard Rose who has been
sidelined by a bad sprain forthe past
two games. .

Albany Has Momentum .

Analysis: Albany has the momen-
tum and has been scoring regularly.
While Cortland‘s defense may
temper the Danes‘ attack. Albany
should still find the net at leasttwo
or three times.

DefensiVely. the Danes match up
at least even with Red Dragons. so
one goal may be enough for a win.

In any case, this is the ﬁrst must
game in a season of six big games.

jeopardy. .

building the conﬁdence and momen-

On Friday afternoon the un-

of the Faculty Student Association

and pushed through several by-law

this was authored by undergraduate

rationale that students. especially

Library Survey Shows Book Losses

by Elizabeth Freedman

The alarmingly high rate of books
stolen. lost. or otherwise missing
from the SUNYA library has caused
a great amount of concern on the
part of University faculty members
and personnel.

In a recent survey to determine the
percentage of books missing from
the library collection in the last
academic year (74-75). two groups of
books were randomly chosen as
samplings. Both groups contained

l.000 volumes each. One group, con:

taining books of over two years old.

had about 7% missing. or unaccoun-
table f'or. The other set. which in-
cluded newer books (under two
years old) had about I0% of" its
collection gone. The books missing
were presumably still in the library's
possession. but had not beenchurg-
ed out to anyone on circulation.
Although the survey is far from
foolproof as an indication for the
percentage of books missing from
theentire library collection. and only
hypothetical conclusions can be
drawn from the results, it does reveal
that a high rate of loss is a very real

tltcy could retain a dc t'ttclo student
majority and still comply with the
letter of t be low. An example ol‘such
it plan was unveiled by Coyne at the
ntccting. Basically it would have in-
creased the studentreprcsentationon
the Membership Board by four while
appointing an equal number of Un-
ivcrsity Council Members. By doing
this a fifty-fifty split between
students and non-students would
technically be maintained but in fact
with many ol'thcsc Council members
living for from Albany it would be

doubtful that they could attend the
bulk of the meetings. This is signifi-
cunt bccnusc the absence of one of
them in the face of perfect student
attendance would give the students it
working majority.

Also. the rule which stated that t he
University's Vice President for
Management and Planning should
automatically be the President of
FSA was altered so as to make it ll

position clcctablc by the Board of

Directors. This change opens up the

general

presented on both sides-the, 

debate had become'pe‘riphe r tothe
major issue of st udent control and so

. this measure passed by the same 14—

l2 vote. , .

'l‘hat consensus was not complete-
ly impossible can be seen in the
support received by a
recommendation that the FSA
chttngc its name us ot'Januttry first to
University Auxiliary Services
(UAS). This was adopted because
oftltc confusion of FSA with other
groups on campus .whosc initials

Although both sides SilW through

politicttl realities of what was
happening no angry words were ex-
cltttttgcd. The faculty and od-

SA Makes Restrictions 0n Solicitations
After Charging Paper With Harassment

by Betty Stein

Claiming il-ﬂi they were “harass-
ing students“ on the podium. Stu-
dent Association Vice President
Rick Mccklcr revoked the solicita-
tion pcrtnit of several Socialist
newspaper huwkcrs on September
24. Although the pcrmit was re-
issucd within a matter of hours. the
incident has raised important
questions about thecxtcut of control
SA—or anyonc~~ *has overthc public
sale of newspapers.

"I gave them four warnings.“ said
Mccklcr. who claims he received
several complaints from students
about the “hard-sell" tactics used by
groups such as the Young Socialist
Alliance to sell their newspapers.

Meckler subsequently told the
hawkcrs they could not approach
students individually. Instead.
Mccklcr said they would be allowed
to stand outside and hold up the

and prominent problem on campus.
it is rapidly becoming a central issue
and an area of major concern for the
library and the authorities.

The problem is by no means uni-
que to our library. Other libraries
with similar troubles of missing
books by theft or other means. have
attempted to control the rapid deple-
tion, of their resources through
mechanical methods and modern
technology. State University of New
York at Fanningdalc. has specially
treated their books in a way that

newspapers. shouting whatever
slogans they wanted.

American Civil Liberties Union
attorney (irctu Powers howcvcrsuys
that SA is oversteppingits bounds in
making such it restriction. “The Stu-
dcnt Association doesn‘t have and
can't have anyjurisdiction on this.“
said Powers. speaking on behalf of
tile Socialist groups.

"lftltcy actually harass somebody.
then you can arrest them." she said.
"otherwise. they can‘t be restricted."

SA President Andy llauman
defended the conditions laid ottt by
Mccklcr. "it‘s not interfering with
the right of free speech." Silitl
Bauman. “We're not stoppingtltem
from selling anything they want."

Bauman feels that the hawkers
were the ones overstepping their
bounds. “They were ttccosting or
harassing the students.“ he said.
"'l'bcrc‘s no need to go upto [them].“

According to Powers. a similar
case came up in Albany about six
months ago. in this instance. several
people selling Socialist newspapers
til the corner of State and Pearl were
arrested on charges of harassment
and not having a vendor‘s license.

The judge ruled itt favor of the
hawkcrs. He held that license laws
are not applicable to political
literature. since its purpose is to get
out ideas. not make money.

SA lawyer Sandy Rosenblum feels
this is a different situation. “The
State University campus is not the
streets of New York." said
Roscnblum. who claims the issue is
one of accessibility.

"What's effective here is tocall out
what they have to offer or walk
around.“ he said. asserting that

studentsnrc use to purcltttstngtltings
ill the tables in the ('zttttptts ('cntct'
lobby. and don't like being directly
approached.

"i don‘t think anyone has the right
to interfere with another person‘s
privacy or passage across at public
place." said Roscnblum. “This is
something they [SA] should do with
all CllSCS. ttot just the Socialists." he
added. cmphusiring that SA has no
axe to grind with the Socialist
groups in particular.

Powers called this restriction un-
reasonable. "People don‘t have to
stand still and talk to them if they
don't want to." said Powers. "lfpeo-
pic don‘t want them doittgthis. they
won‘t buy their newspapers."

According to Powers. no college

can claim the right to make such

restrictions by saying that it is not a
public place. Courts have upheld the
right of an individual to freedom of
speech in all areas generally open to
the public. even on private cam-
puses. This would include. for exam-
ple. the podium and Campus Center
lobby. but not such areas as the dor-
mitories.
