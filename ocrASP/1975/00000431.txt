Some notes on the proceedings:
One would have to strive to un-
cover any tangible results of the
weekend’s conference. The event. in-

' tended mainly as a showcase for the

candidates and their ideas; was one

-in a series of regional conferences

that are being provided so that un-
committed Democrats ean inspect
the candidates and begin to make up
their minds whil the committed

‘ attempt to introduce The Man with

the Presidential Timbre.
Homogeneity was the name of the
game here. As most of the par-
ticipants were of identical mold -
New Democratic Coalition ex-
McGovcrnites -- each candidate
made an effort to hew to the stan-
dard liberal line. As a result. sub-
stamch ideological differences in
their verbiage were narrow to the
point of" invisibility.
internal Warfare

The internal warfare that so
typifies Democratic politics was ab-
sent here. It appears that the Udall-
hackers and the Harris-supporters
have not yet realized that the
McGovern banner no longer unites
them. Members ofthe various camps
still mingled to reminisce about the
Spring of‘~'72. It seems it will be a
while before it dawns on the NDCers
that the candidates‘ interests are in-
imical.

to another. All manner of Democrat

enjoying a spot of Almaden financed

the possibility of the kind of political

Studenmgr App“

by Sue Emerson

Amid mounting concern over
New York City‘s ﬁscal crisis. the
“Save Our City Committee" formed
by Assemblyman Joseph F. LisaiD-
Queens) and Mrs. Louis Armstrong.
widow of the famed musician. or-
ficially opened its campaign in New
York last Friday.

According to David Weprin,
SUNYA student and public college
coordinator for the committee, “We
want to show the ‘big cats' that New
Yorkers themselves are interested in
saving New York City."

Weprin conﬁrms that the com-
mittee will conduct a drive aimed at
having state residents indicate a
willingness to purchase Municipal
Assistance Corporation (MAC)
bonds in denominations of $50 and
$100. Presently the bonds are
available only in amounts of $1,000
or larger. If enough interest is
shown, according to Weprin, thisin-
formation will be taken directly to
"Big MAC" in the hopes of speeding
up their decision to issue the bonds
in smaller denominations.

Weprin describes the most impor-
tant function of the “Save Our City
Committee" as the development of a
show of support for New York City;
the money is of secondary impor-
tance in his opinion.

As an explanation for the claim
that the fate of the state rests with the
fate of the city Weprin says, “It's all a
question of confidence." Weprin

feels that ii the city should default.
no one will purchase state bonds of
any type. Some of these state bonds
help subsidize construction at State
University campuses. An example is
the HFA bonds supporting the con-
struction of the Amherst Campus at
Buffalo. "The New York City crisis
directly affects State University
students." says Weprin.

Weprin plans to distribute
petitions among college students as
'Well as sending a letter to the editors

of all State University newspapers. .

Weprin emphasizes that the college
drive especially will focus on a show
of support since” he believes that
college students are not ready to
purchase MAC bonds. Became the
bonds are not issued in the smaller
denominations. signing a petition
will merely indicate a willingness to
purchase them if and when they
become available. Plans for mailing
a letter to parents of SUN Y students
is also under consideration.
Directly relating to the matter of
default. Weprinsays.“| don‘t believe
New York City is going to default.
It's not ready to default." But if that
should happen. MAC bond holders
will be paid before city employees. in
the opinion of the legal counsel to
MAC. Weprin feels that if everyone
in the state would buy a MAC bond.
“there‘s no question in my mind that
New York City would be saved."

of Governor Carey‘s support of the

city. Weprin commented. “At this
point. I think he's doing all he can."
Although there was a “time when he
wasn‘t doing his utmost." according
to Weprin. he "now realizes there's
an urgent need."

Weprin believes thatthe default of .

New York City is “not going to be
the end ofthe world.“ but that it will
adversely affect the city. the state.
and other large cities throughout the
United States. Weprin feels that all
state residents should realize a moral
commitment to the city.

Another local college student,
Jonathan E. Portnoy of Union

College in Schenectady. will handle .

the petition drive for the state’s
private colleges and universities.
Both Weprin and Portnoy have serv-

The International Film Group.
better known as I.F.G.. was started
back in I954 by Dr. Arthur Lennig
who teaches film here. The purpose
of'thegroupisto bringtothecampus
the kind of films that Albany State
Cinema and Tower East avoid-little
films for the “special interest" ﬁlm-
goer.

Dwindling Attendance

But apparently less and less people
are being drawn to I.F.G. bythese
films. "I Was a Fugitive from a
Chain Gang.“ the I930 gangster
classic. shown last semester. at-
tracted a mere handful of people. In
fact. most of the films shown by
I.F.G. last semester were commer-

cial disasters except for “King of
Hearts." which drew four capacity ‘
crowds. Randy Gold. manager for
I.F.G.. accounts for the “King's”
popularity: “It‘s a fairy tale with a
pseudo-heavy message. so people
use it as an acceptable substitute for
first-run films. It's simply a winner.”
Naturally “King of Hearts“ will be
on the menu for the fall of l975. "We
have to make up the money we lose
on everything else we _show

.somehow.“ says Randy.

l.F.G.'s failure with little known I
films has prompted more than just
booking “King of Hearts” agair A
quick check oftheirfall line-upshow
a considerable turn of events.
