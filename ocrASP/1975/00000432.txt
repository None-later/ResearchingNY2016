- Several passengers

who boarded bus 45'

at Draper Hall last Tuesday willingly
expressed their views concerning the
no smoking policy.

“I think it's fantastic" asserted
graduate student Peter Pollak, ad-
ding, “and I think it should be en-
forced too." Pollak. like other
regular bus riders. are concerned
that the no smoking rule is f rcquent-
l y violated.

Fred Childs. also a graduate stu-
dent, rides the buses two or three
times a day. Cl‘ilds respects the no

mitted that there were problem with
the no smoking policy. “I'm sure that
here are bus drivers that are smok-
ing" said'Kopf.. adding“! know this
is setting a bad example.” Kopt'
noted that hehasnolegal authority to
forbid his drivers from smoking, but
he added. “I will say to my drivers
‘don‘t-be the ﬁrst to light up’.” '

Kopt mentioned that ever since

the no smoking policy was im-

plemented last year (as a result of a
Central Council bill 7475-24 -
Cancerous Buses) there has been "a
problem with policing it. . .people
tell us they'll do what they darn well
please.”

Citing problems of maintaining a
tight schedule. Kopt' believes it is on-
reasonable to expect a bus driver to
stop and tell a smoker to leave the
bus. In addition Kopf thinks a
driver “doesn't want to start any in-
cidents.” Kopf, who recognizesthat
smoking can be “pretty aggravating
in conﬁned areas," readily admitted.

of enforcing state “no no lag"

law inthe neatluture.‘ A: of July r. 7‘

l975 State SenateArtieie IJ-E has
been in effect. The law reads in part.
“It shall be unlawful for any person
to smoke tobacco in any.public
means of mast transportation."
Oddly, it has not yet been established
whether the law is applicable to the
SUNYA buses.
OtIIelal lupusdbllty

The New York State Department
of Transportation is officially
responsible for making such
decisions and presently it appears
that little thought has been given to
the matter. Audrey Sternberg,
counsel to the Department of
Transportation. when asked
whether the law applies to the
SUNYA buses simply answered, “I
don‘t know.“ Sternberg said thatin

President Andy Bauman aniWered
“through peer pressure:' 
remarked that it‘s not fair to expat:

the bus drivers to enforce the policy.

“he's supposed to drive a hint Aer
cording to liauman. most problems
of smoking on'the bus can be resolv-
ed by a mild complaint. .

For sophmore Philip Donnoio, a
SUN YA bus rider. polite complaints
are usually effective “in stilling a
smoker. “Sometimes I can tolerate
it." Donnolo said, “but when it
becomes bothersome.” he added
laughingly, “I take the 'law into my
own hands."

both of which should attract a fairly

which Randy doesn‘t expect anyone
to show up for. “Sure we’ll lose
money on this one, but somebody
here wanted to see it. so we hooked
it. Tower East or Albany State
Cinema are like G.M. compared to
us. We can take risks because we
don't have the kind of money that
other organizations have tied up in
