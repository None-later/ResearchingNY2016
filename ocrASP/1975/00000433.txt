In. an interview published inﬂte
Berkeley Barb last June. Moore
stated that she had been assigned by

. the F.B.l. to make contact with
radical groups. The FBI. has since
conceded that Moore was an infor-
mant until last June. adding that she
occasionallysupplied information to
the bureau as recently as last week.

Moore‘s last known address in
San Francisco wasa house previous-
ly rented by a couple who had ad-
mitted to having acquaintances in
the Symbionese Liberation (Anny.

« However. perhaps the strangest ele-
ment of all is the report from Larry
ﬁnsky. the news director of station-
K.P.F.A. in Berkely. Bensky. who
had interviewed Moore several
weeks ago. says he received a call
from her last week informing him of
Patty Hearst's arrest. The strange
thing about the incident. Bensky
says, is that he received the call just
prior to the actual time the F.B.l.-
reportedly arrested Patty.

LEFTIST ACTIVITIES
‘ SABOTAGED
A former undercover informer for
the Chicago Police Department has
testiﬁed in court that he was paid
SiOO a week by U.S. Army ln-
‘tclligence to violently disrupt leftist
political activities in the l960‘s.
The admitted informer, Thomas
Steward. states that he fronted for
both the Chicago police and for us.
Army lntelligcnce by working with a
private rightwing organization
known as the “Legion of J'ustice."
Stewart says that members of thc
legion were instructed by police and
military ofﬁcials to break into leftist
political organizations, to steal from
and destroy their ﬁlesand to rough
up members of these organizations if
necessary.

his group used these gas bombs
against Soviet and Chinese
theatrical groups to disrupt their
public performances in the Chicago
area. ‘ .

Stewart says that members of the -

legion ivere also given clubs and
mace, and that the weapons were
used to "hospitalize" members of a
Socialist‘ group which legion
members were told 'to attack.

Stewart told his story in court in
an attempt to overturn a conviction
for burglarizlng a church and
threatening the priests. He stated
that he had been assigned by his
police and military superiors to
burglarize the church. but had been
promised complete immunity from
prosecution for any violence that oc~
cured.

Aftcrapproximately ninety days
of research and deliberation. former
SU N Y A President Benezet's
Priorities Committee made several
suggestions concerning the Psy-
chology Department. One of the ma-
jor points made by the committee
was that the department be given
three years to upgrade faculty.
graduate student and program quali-
ty. An increased allocation of
resources was not included however.

Last semester. a group was created
under the authority of President
Benezet to recommend priorities for
the future of SUNYA‘s academic
programs. Commencing their work
on January 24. l975. this Select
Committee on Academic Priorities
assessed the quality ofthe programs
made recommendations and com-
pleted its final report by May is.
I975.

The sentiments oflast year‘s chair-
man. Richard C. 'l'ecvan. tothisﬁrst
part of the evaluation was summed
up by his written remark, “It would
seem that the new chairman is being
asked to make bricks without
straw.“ The new chairman, Gordon
(1'. Gallup Jr.. also finds this aspect
ofthe report to be a contradiction in
itself. Without additional resources.
it is felt that no great reforms can be
made. Remaining optimistic despite
the Psychology department's failure
to place in the nation‘s top ten. Mr.
(inllup feels that with adequate sup-
port. his department‘s attainment of
prominence will be possible in afew
years.

[his financial issue seems to be
one ofthe strongest bones of conten-
tion bet ween the Psychology depart-
ment and the Select Committee. The
Division of Social and Behavioral
Sciences (of which the psychology
department is a part). is the most
poorly funded of all those on the
Albany campus. The handicap of
heavy enrollments is augmented to
the problems of inadequate budget.
being understaffed and under-
cquipped. The psychology
department‘s doctoral program is
one of the biggest in the College of
Arts and Sciences as well.

'l'hcrct'orc.in response to this and
other statements. the Psychology
Department. led by Mr. ’l‘ccvttn.
prepared a memorandum to Presi-
dent Benczci requesting an oppor-
tunitytomcct with any representative
who could explain certain facets of

PSYCh: 

the appraisal. According ‘to Mr.
Gallup. this request was never
honored. . ’ .

Secondly. the committee chose to
comment upon the five new faculty
members (including the chairman).
suggesting that these positions be
filled only after the thorough use of
procedures exercising “the very
highest academic standards". The
new chairman was also expected to
improve both efﬁciency and morale
within the Psychology department.
As a third portion ofthis recommen~
dation. the committee counseled the
department to admit fewer graduate
students. with high standards being
called for once again. This denotes

poor past judgement on the
department‘s behalf in engaging new
employees. This new implication is
later reversed by a subsequent state-
ment. Praising some members ofthe
junior faculty for displaying promis-
ing behavior. By complimenting
these people. it is insinuated that the
department has indeed been adher-
ing to high standards in their hiring
practices forthe past several years at
least.

As to the other comments. Mr.
Gallup says that since his arrival. he
has felt that there is nothing wrong
with departmental morale and that
there is obviously a high efficiency
levcl presently existing (considering
all of the adverse factors with which
they must content).

l'he Select Committee also ad-
vised that all non-productive faculty
members should be assigned to
undergraduate teaching This would
ullcgcdly free the morc productive
members to conduct research and
aid the graduate students.“ That
which is understood by the term
"non-productive faculty“ is am-
biguous. Perhaps that is why this
specific point was not responded to
in lust year‘smemo. However.tuking
“non-productiie factulty" to mean
those members not actively involved
in research. instruction. etc. and/or
those who are least capable. compe-
tent and enthusiastic. Mr. (iallup‘s
reply is “Since when did undcr-
graduates become second class
citizens. . . at SUNYAT'

The department was also in-
structed to place special emphasis on
thoscarcas in which it is relatively

well-qualified; these supposedly be-
ing the areas of botlt social and
clinical psychology. There is an in-
consistency here though, because a

cot concluded that more

general experimental. This external ~
report . of three years ago. the' '

Solomon Report. was” com
missioned bythe University and con-
sisted of a review of SUNYA‘s psy-
chology deparment by three
nationally recognized psychologists.
Another complaint of the com-
mittee was geared to the question of
insularin in the psychology depart-
ment. According to Mr. Tecvan‘s
memo. there is some interchange
benveen the department and the
Biology department. School of
Business. Albany Medical School.
cc. Mr. Gallup also added to this
already impressive list. participation
in the Capital District Psychiatric
Center and the possibility of having
a joint PhD. in Child Psychology
with the Education Department.
Some of these liasons have been in
operation since the Solomon
Report. Besides all that. students
from this department areulso said to
take many more courses from out-
side the department andthedivision.

Former President lonesot appointed the Academic
Constitutes which suggested ehongoofntho psychology doparhnont. ’

than those from most other
departments.

Perhaps the prime targe of the
department's defensive response is
the Committee‘s comments about
their graduate students. This
criticism seems to be nearly un-
f'orgivcttblc in the eyes ofthe depart-
ment. Because so many more
applications are received by the psy-
chology department‘s doctoral
program than any other in the Ans

and Science's. it is felt that students
who are accepted here are from
among the school’s best.

In an attempt to explain the ap-
parent contradictions between the
evaluation and the depurtmenal
beliefs. the commitlcc has been said
to have ignored certain information
urtd to be guilty of pro-judging the
department based on thetinding ol‘a
previous report. However. this point
has yet to be substantiated.

Tribune Voice of Administration

view of campus occurcnccs.
Originally a two page publication.

four pages.

Accordingto Nathalie Lampmtm.
Editor of the Tribune. the paper is
concerned only with campus
happenings. Priority is given to the
reporting of acts of official bodies
(i.c. Faculty Student Association.
University Senate and Central
Council) and to curriculum
decisions. All reporting is factual

and there is little. if any. room for
opinion.

Work on tltc ‘I‘rilmmr begins on
Mondays. when the staff assembles
and discusses probable articles for
the nest issue. "Thursday is the
deadline for all stories. On Monday.
6.000 copies of the Tribune are cir-
culatcdthroughoutthc campus. Last
year. 38 issues were published.

An average issue of the Tribune
includes news. sports. a complete
schedule at campus events called
"Campus Clipboard". a column cn-
titled “Round the Campus“. and
Faculty information (i.e.
publications and grants).

Small Staff

Because their staff is small. news
coverage is limited. Most of the in-
formation is given to the Tribune
rather than sought out.

Since the Tribune is funded by the
administration. it sometimes reflects
the administration's point of view.
says Lampman. Potentially
slanderous remarks are not printed.
Ron Jacobs. graduate assistant for

the department and reporter for the
’I'ri/rtmt' sees this scllLintposcd cen-
sorship as u mcttns of “doing things
with taste."

Lampmttn admits that thc
'I'rilttrm' is if conservatitc paper in
terms oftoue. make-up. and writing
style. She does feel that its ﬂight“
news stories and its clarity enable the
reader to quickly pick out the es-
scncc of a story.

readily welcomes l‘i\ili publications.
