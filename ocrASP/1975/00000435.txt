grave injustice to the rights of every SUNYA
student came to the attention of Central
v Council. As a Central Council member my
. right'to assess a Student Association matter
was repressed. This duly elected council blind-
ly voteng-J-B to ignore an urgently pressing
matter before this council. .

0n the afternoon of Sept. 24. the Albany

Coalition Against Racism's solicitation
privileges were revoked by SA Vice-President
Rick Meckler. ACAR. at that time. wastrying
to sell an ideological newspaper the Workers

Vanguard. The tone or ideology of this
newspaper are unimportant; what is impor-
tant is that the constitutional right of free press
was violated by Student Association. They
were then told by Meckler and three armed
security police to cease the sale of their
newspaper. A short time later their
solicitations permit was revoked.

The revocation of this permit clearly con-
stitutes a violation of this group's rights; yet
more importantly the rights of every student
were trampled on. There is a prescribed
procedure for the revocation of a solicitation
permit and it states. “Solicitations approval
may be revoked by the President or the
President‘s designee upon the receipt of a
reasonable written complaintfs)”.

There was in fact no written complaint at
the time. Did Meckler act on his own volition?
If in fact ACAR violated the solicitation
policy is not an issue. what is at issue is that
Vice~President Meckler. who should at all
times uphold SA regulations. ﬂagrantly pur-
sued a course of action in violation of one he
was bound to pursue. Is this to become the
precendent? Will this occur again and again?
Are we the students going to acquiese to this
abuse?

As a commuter representative of Central
Council it is my duty to investigate any
violaton of student's rights by the Administra-
tion. It is. however. every member‘s obligation
and every student‘s duty to insure fair in-
vestigation of Student Association abuse. I
was prevented from doing this at the Council
meeting in question and I sincerely hope this
incident will never occur again.

On Registering

A Complaint

To the Editor:

I for one would like to complain about the
quality of the complaint letters which arecon-
stantly being printed! Why must the same
bland complaints constantly be reprinted. (i.e.
Ken Wax‘s pile. or rather column.) It gets
down right boring. From now oncomplaints
should only be accepted if theyareimpnrtant
and unusual. For instance. instead of thecons-
tant run-of-the-milhouse complaint about
F. S. A. now costing you a quarter to get your
check cashed. I would be interested in reading
a letter complaining why it's only a quarter.
Why can't they charge us 40c or better yet 50c?
Let's get to the bottom of thial

Another complaint which I haven't read
much about in the ASP since Fall of l973 is

'this: Why must “The Circle" be between
Colonial and State Quads? It seems totally on-
' fair to Indian and Dutch to keep it there your
after year. Getting back to Ken Wax. orrsther

Mohawk: Take It

It's Yours

To the Editor:

Concerning the proposals to reconvert the
Mohawk Tower to a dormitory facility. there
is a perspective to debate that I have not yet
seen aired. The matter seems to be approached
as though the faculty and students who
currently use the facility are comfortable and
prepared to resist student claimstooccupancy
rights.

As a member of the faculty of the School of
Criminal Justice. l have been moved from
Pierce Hall to the Library Annex and ﬁnally
to that vertical monstrosity. Mohawk Tower.
which I would gladly return to student oc-
cupancy. Try working or teaching(we do hold
some classes there) to the sounds of blaring
rock and roll and football practice; try keeping
your research materials dry when the walls
leak with every rain; try working in the
summer with the tower‘s unbearable heat but
unable to open the windows lest you and your
material be splattered against the wall; try go-
ing up and down twenty floors on elevators
that are often out of commission or move at a
snail‘s pace at best; try conducting a research
oriented graduate program where our
students have little or no space to work or
simply relate to each other; try working in a
building so poorly constructed that you can
hear the person next door changetheir mind.

The building simply does not work as an
academic facility. and I will lodge no protest
over a fourth move in six years. Obviously.
there are questions concerning where we move
and what academic accoutrcments move with
us. but this is not the occasion to raise these
matters.

In closing. I note only that since SA appears
to pitch its arguments on an economic basis. I
wonder if it will be willing to guarantee a cer-
tain level of occupancy so that our ﬁnancially
squeezed state is not further impaired. I would
suggest that the stronger argument is that the
current mix of living and working space is un-
tenable and that the students‘ claimtocampus
proximity is stronger than the claim of
graduate school occupancy. especially since
graduate schools (or at least ours) are fairly
autonomous and not closely integrated with
the rest of the campus.

I trust it is clear that I speak for myself here
and that I realize there are competingcquities
and claims. lsay onlythat I am reluctant. not a
recalcitrant. occupant of Mohawk Tower.

by Ken Wax

It‘s getting around the middle ol'the semester. test-time. and I‘m getting morcthan a little sick
of hearing the complainers tell me how tough they‘ve got it here at college. The need to study
permeates all conversations. and many are reduced to nervous wrecks by “important” tests.

Just how important are those “important” exams anyway?

Remember Regent Exams in high school? The worrying started towards the end of April. and
snowballed until the end of June. at which time we were sure our right to continue living would
depend on our Regents mark. Then came college. and we looked back and saw the tests‘ true
place in this universe. as a tiny lump of turd. At the time they certainly had the aura of all
importance. but through the wisdom of hindsight. its clear they weren't. See where I‘m leading?

And now in college. no matter how all-importantthe teacher would like you to believe his tests
arc.thetruth is that they toourenothing but yet another tiny lump of turd. At best. they measure
how well you can regurgitatc bits of information that will uttdoubtedly be forgotten by next year
(Who out there still remembers. from eighth grade. the principle exports of Paraguay?) And at
worst. they test your ability to contort your thinkings to conform to the teacher‘s.

And grades have lost their magic. No longer does a college education mean assured jobs. You
can ask my friend Frank. whojust graduated from Duke University's Graduate School. about
that. He‘s working as ajanitor in Eisenhower Park. The world has learned that the statistics of
academia lie. saying nothing about that person's ability to think on their own. The degrec'means

nothing.

The point? Spend your college years solely on academics. and you waste the most formative
years of your life. Relatively unencumbered by rcalworldresponsibilitics. college affords you the
opportunity to spend a few years learning about yourself and how you ﬁt into the world around
you. Those are the real lessons of college. and if your spend these years worryingly worshipping
Icstbooks and bell curves. you‘re doing yourself the ultimate injustice.

The onlything lestsmcasure is whether or not you‘ll succumb to their artificial pressures. And
whenever you opt against doing something you want to do on the grounds of “I have sourwo
much work to do". you‘re succumbing. There is this incredible world of uniqueness and
magniﬁcent beauty all around you. but the veil of next Thursday‘s Economics test is blotting it
out. Because you'reallowing it to. There are adventures awaiting you. adventures which will be
your college memories twenty years from now. but you‘re spending Saturday in the library.

Try to look at things as you will live years from now. and enjoy life instead of complaining
about it. Every little occumnce is an education in itself. both making you aware of yet another
facet of this thing called life. and testing your ability to adapt to it. Sure. failures are inevitable.
but without them our successes would have no meaning. Problems cross our paths only to make
us appreciate when they‘re not there. so conquer them. don‘t dwell upon ‘cm.

And next time you're convinced that you've really got it rough. hop a bus to Albany Medical
Center Hospital. Take a walkthroughaward. pasta guy your age who has just been told he’ll
be crippled from the waist down for the rest of his life. Look at a nineteen year old girl who has
lost her tight because of a car accident. Watch a man weep uncontrollably as he watches his wife
die from a stroke. Then think about how tough you've got it.

It's reallyqulte an incredible place this planet earth. Filled with unlimited beauty. boundless
grandeur. and plenty of people. each .one as complex and interesting as ourselves. But
unlortunately. we don‘t stay here too long. As the earth measures its time. we are here but a split
second. countable to a single lick of flame inthelife of a barnlire. Now how can you find the time

to be miserable?

Death: A Legal Definition

35W:  . . ..
In St. Clare‘s Hospital in Denvillc, N.J.,

   

' twenty-one year old Karen Ann Quinlan lies

languishing between life and death. She has
been in a coma since April 15 and a
mechanical respirator that sustains her
breathing is all that keeps her alive today.
Having already suffered brain damage hcr
adoptive parents want Karen to be permitted
to die with “grace and dignity." But the young
woman‘sdoctors refuse to let her die and the
respirator continues to function. Subsequent-
ly. Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Quinlan have turned
to Judge Robert Muir. Jr. of New Jersey
Superior Court. They have asked him to
authorize the disconnection of the respirator.
Of course Karen's doctors don‘t wish her to
suffer anymore than her parents do. The point
is. though. that the ,doctor who "pulls the
plug“ is undoubtedly afraid of being charged
‘with a criminal violation, since an affirmative
act of euthanasia - the taking of the life of
someone who is hopelessly sick or injured for
Ireasons of mercy - constitutes homicide. The
major issue before this court hearing on Oc-
tober 20th will be whether the withdrawal of
extraordinary life-sustaining procedures
should be treated in the same manner as eu-
thanasia.
' Upon investigation one begins to feel that
there is a definite distinction betwem cu-

, thanasia and the withdrawal of extraordinary

life-sustaining devices. The former implies
death of those people who are no longer
capable of performing a viable socinl function
because of their incapacity - be it because one

less demanding. The Council 'on Educational Policy of the University Senate is 
debating thoae requirements. termed “distribution requirements". and Presidents
Fields is interesed in reinstituting them.

The requirements were eliminated partly because it was felt that the students
themselves can best decide their own education. and partly because ofits effect on
comparative enrollment. (Some departments gained students. some last.)

Students pay to attend, and should have the freedom to choose what caurses they
take. Indeed, this has become a reason for choosing SUNYA. since intelligent and'
responsible students are attracted to a school where they can designdtheir own learning
experience. Some students have not been affected since they must take formerly
required courses tofulﬁll their major or satisfy post-graduate work and others would
want to fulfill those requirements anyway.

Yet there are those students with regrets. Students should seriously corsidertakinga
language because it may be useful; one can take pride as a college-educated adult
knowing the purposes of mitachondria. the League of Nations and demand curves.
These years at a university are the last chance most students will have to expand their
knowledge. ’

Distributioh requirements should not be reinstated, except possibly in a minor form ;
mandating only that a few credits be taken outside the student‘s major. Students are ' .
responsible enough to control their own education. though it is reasonable to mandate 3
that there be a major. 3‘

The Senate‘s Educational Policies Council (EPC)‘shouId recognize that a varied ‘ ' 
course distribution leads to a liberal education and that it should be encouraged,.but r i
the EPC should not recommend that there again be requirements.

    
   
   
   
   
  
   
  
  
     
   
  

 

 

 

 

Untimely Death

The death this weekend of Ray Glass. Legislative. Director of SASU (Student
Association of the State University) is a severe blow to SASU, all SUNYstudents and
the entire educational community in the state. His contribution tostudent causes while
lobbying for SASU is undeniable.

Ray was hit last week by a car driven by a drunken driver. and this serves as still
another shocking reminder that driving while intoxicated can do incredible damage.
We mourn Ray‘s passing. and offer condolences to his family and friends;

a mind that is in complete touch with reality. A
mind that still acts as a force for inspiration
and still maintains aspirations.

Any person whose mind is intact - even
though he be on in years. or physically in-
capacitated. or facing imminent death - is still
fully human and should be treated with subsc-
qucnl dignity and respect. To rcmovethnt per-
son from society through euthanasia would
truly be an act of homicide.

The Quinlan case though is different and
goes beyond euthanasia. Her life continues
through extraordinary means; her existence is
now no better than that of an animal. That is
when the “pl ug“ should “be pulled“. when peo-
ple are functioning purely as organ systems
due to some cquipntenl that is hooked up to
them.

Under the traditional test of death. lifcdocs
not end so long as breathing continues and the
heart beats. A few states, though- but not New
Jersey where Karen lives - have adopted the
definition that brain death. or the loss of
organized brain waves. is thclcgal end oflifc.

The latter seems a more valid criteria for
determining the point at which the continua-
tion of human existence is futile and
worthless. The greatest of pains has to be the
pain the Quinlttns are now experiencing.
watching their daughter the as an animal.

Euthanasia can either be looked at nsnsub-
jectivc decision by the patient to commit
suicide or as an act of mltrder bylhe physician
who shuts off In life supporting machine. It is
understood that in cancer patient or elderly
person may wish to quietly leave this world.
Ilut as a policy ofthe state it leaves itself open
to indiscriminate extinction of those who are
infirm. The ethics of euthanasia fall in gray
area.

For Karen Ann Quinlan on the other hand.
the situation is to such an extreme that the
decision to let herdie goes well beyond the am
bivalenco of euthanasia.
