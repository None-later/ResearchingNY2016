The game opened slowly. Each

broke the ice with six minutes left in

During the halftime break Pups‘
’ Coach Evan Congress complained
about the general play of his team.
“You guys aren't passing good out
there." said Congress. “The passes
are either too short or too long. RPI
is beating you to the ball. The half-
backs aren‘t anticipating the passes.
You‘ve got to keep your passes quick
and sharp."

(Soccer overtime consists of two

The Pups scored at 6: ID of thefirst
overtime period when Jim Best, an
RPI fullback. headed the ball into
the net while attempting to clear it.
The rules of soccer award the man
closest to the ball with a goal; in this
case Doug Payne.

The Pups continued to apply
pressure on Decker. and Stu Hubbs
converted during a scramble in front
of the Engineers net at 8:45 of the
first overtime. adding an unassisted
insurance goal.

The second overtime was
dominated by a relaxed Albany
squad. Congress began substituting
frequently to keep fresh troops on
the field as much as possible.

After the game Congress said the
star was Ciocio. “Ciocio‘s tying goal
early in the second half sparked as
and lifted us to-victory." said Con<
gress.

He also said. a total team effort
was the “root of the victory."

This game coupled with last

One obstacle remains. ' It-
represents the difference between a
good year and a great one for the .
Albany State Tennis Team. The
squad. winners of all five fall
matches and coming off' a superb
showing at the Eastern College
Athletic Conference championships
(ECAC's) now look towards the
SUNY Athletic Conference cheni-
pionships. easily the year‘s biggest
challenge.

Until now, it’s all been quizzes.
The SUNYAC‘s are the final ex-
amination.

The Team has virtually demolish-
ed their competition. A recap of the
season shows Oswego napalmed 9-0:
Oneonta overwhelmed 6-3; RPI
eliminated 84; and Plattsburgh
pounded 9-0. This past Saturday.
Cortland became victim number
five. falling 9-0. Before the
SUNYAC‘s. a rescheduled match
against New Paltz will be played on
Thursday at 2:00 pm. on the Indian
Quad Courts.

lineups—they wind up the top six
and send them out.

AAB Approves
Women’s 3-Miler

by Patricia Murphy
The addition of a women‘s 3-mile
race to the Albany Invitational

.Cross-Country Run was un-

animously approved by the Athletic
Advisory Board Sept. 26.

Albany State is the second four
year school in the northeast to in-
stitute a high level cross-country race
for college women in aninvitational.
according to meet director Keith
Munsey. He feels this addition is
long overdue in light of current
world-wide and national interest in
women's sports activities of all sorts.

According to the proposal sub-
mitted by Coach Munsey. participa-
tion by women has been allowed in
the past. However. only one or two
of approximately 300 athletes in the
typical invitational have been
women. Ellen Turkot. an individual
from Plattsburgh State who was one
of the women who ran in the men‘s

trace. favored the institution of a
separate Women‘s race.

It is probable that women from
Albany State will be ineligible for

cording to Munsey and Coach Bar-

Palm's Proposal

Palm has drawn up a proposal
calling for the institution of a

though individuals interested in
cross country are in the process of
petitioning for club status. this
proposal has not yet been submitted

to the Athletic Advisory Board for:

The Ninth Annual Cross-Country

Albany State on October 25. The
women‘s race will be the first of the
four races. and will commence at

International

Soccer

It wasn‘t exactly the Olympics.
there was no World Cup awarded.
but it was a lot of fun forthe players
and spectators who were part of the
International Soccer Game held at
Washington Park this past Sunday
afternoon. -

With representatives from several
language clubs. the international
spirit was evident by team cries
heard in different tongues. One team
consisted of Russian club members.
eight Soviet exchange studens. and

French department representative
Dr. Douglas Alexander. the chair-
man.

Opposing them were students ‘of
Fuerza Latina. the Italian-American
Student Alliance. and several faculty
members from the Italian departs
ment.

The many spectators present. with
multi-lingual cheers. supported their
favorite team while enjoying a well-
played game.

Perhaps the most unusual player
was a German representative with
four paws. a wagging tail. and men.
elusive inerest in the soccer ball.
Although everyone found him very
amusing. once the Shepherd wasotf
the field. the action really started.
