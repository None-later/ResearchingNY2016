Two patrol positionl were dropped

by the University Police to make

room for two additional Investigators.

Campus Police To Expand
Investigative Department

by Perry Silver

The University Police are hiring
two additional investigators. Oncis
expected to be working within two
weeks. and the other will start it cou-
pic of weeks after that.

This is a rcorguniultion and not an
expansion of the University police
force. us two patrol positions were
dropped to make room for the new
investigators. This will double tho
sizc ofthc investigation department,
which is presently comprised of two
full-time officers.

The primary function of the cam-
pus investigators is to follow up on
any criminal activity which would
normally require investigation by
police. “We‘re ll service-oriented
organization,“ cxpluincd Gary
O‘Connor. one of the present in-
vcsiigtttors. “Wc try and help
students protect and recover their
property.“ There is it lot of property
to try to recover. as 390.000 worth

was stolen last year alone. About
$70,000 of this was from students
and professors, while the rest
belonged to the state.

“ We hopc the added investigators
will enable us to do n more thorough
job of following up on campus
crimes," said Jim Williams. head of
the! University Police. “especially
with the rush of burglaries we've had
down on Alumni Quudjust this pllst
month alone."

The campus investigators arc on it
call schedule where they are
available for duty at all times. Aside
from investigating robberies, they
also speak at orientation on crimc
prcvcntion, coordinate security for
controversial speakers, and register
bicycles. The morn notable incident
recently involving the campus in-
vestigators occurred ill April, when
they arrested a man on Indian Quad
who hrtd committed ll series of arm-
cd robberies thcrc.

- WThe proponed amendment reads

as follows: .
Equality of rights under the law

shall not be denied or abridged by

the State of New York or any sub-

V division thereof on account of sell.

“(high there has been legislation
toward equality for women. theﬁnal
decision is left up to the interpreta-
tion of the courts. As a result. the
burden of proof of discrimination is
on the plaintiff in each individual
case. For this reason, supporters of
equal rights for women decided to
draft a constitutional ammendmcnt.

New York State is one of the 34
states that has ratified the federal
ERA. Thrccfourths ofthcstatcstiili)
must ratify ll constitutional
nmmcndmcnt within seven years in
order for it to pass. The ammcnd-
mcnt does not then go into effect un-
til two years following passage by the
strttcs . 1975 is the fourth year f orthc
ERA. so if till the states ratify it. it
may be as late its 198] before it
becomes effective.

Ifthc New York State ERA passes
this November, it will go into effect
on January l. 1976. Thus. sup-
porters ofthc ERA in New York lire
trying to speed up the effects ofthc
ummcndmcnt in the State. The con-
tent of the State and Federal
llmmcndmcnts is the same.

One of the main factors that is
traditionally taken into account by
the, courts in interpreting
ammendmcnts to the Constitution is
the intent of Congress. A report by
the Senate Judiciary Committee
attempts to spell out this intcnt.

Many of the rumors that have
spread concerning the effects of thc
ERA arc clarified in this report. For
