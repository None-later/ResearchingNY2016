Funny how things just sort of happen.

I mean not that anyone cares.

But that someone actually dares

To go so far as to accept what's understood
And secs everything in light of what should
Happen to place.

I've run this race. I thought I could break the pace.

Picking at straWS like Bible guffaws . . . ) 
Still. what's this action I smell this pol
And popcorn popping that an ancient go!
In a dime store -

Porno ﬂicks behind the house.

Rubbers at the door,

And a somber Strauss

For fucking und carousing -

It's quite elite

To riddle the landlady

While she‘s sucking Pete.

All it goes and it throes
.\nd it whispers on toes
But tomorrow you‘ll think
It was a bargain on clothes.

And maybe all things better left unsaid

Was a way one: of labelling the dead.

But you don‘t forget the part that was fun-

The other guy thinks your heart is a pump lump sum.

So why not turn it around and around again.
Catch all the trite phrases

Of a time and then

Burn 'cm in the bright hnzcs

Of 3 yesterday when

You would have been the way I thought of you
And I might have seen a dream come true.

One in 3. 3 in one.

and all as if generated by the sun.

Do they know the damage they‘ve done?
Has the fight ended or onlyjust begun? ; 

Who are they. what are they? Where do they belong?
Your guess. like mine. will never be wrong.

Who is it, what is it? Does it fit for you?

It applies universally. so yes for you too!

One is wise. yet the weakest of 3.

for one can‘t play and especially with me.
But the strength one has is eternally deep.
the struggle for one is (extremely steep

 

Two is the strongest of the 3.

but although two tries. two can’t capture me.
Two is the warmest. and even quite hot.

but as for wanting two. right now I do not. '

Now 3 of 3 has the greatest power.

Not 3's strength. no. 3‘; only a ﬂower.

But 3 command: my my will '

drawing a caterpillar requires some skill.

3 also hold my evcry'thought,

for 3 I‘d do anything though love cen't be bought. 

So u 3 hum me. I but one,

and in the meantime with two I have fun.
But fun-it no substitute for real love.

ask 3 or one. or the spirits from above.

If I fail to win 3 as one failed with toe.
with two I'll be one, and then I'll be free.
