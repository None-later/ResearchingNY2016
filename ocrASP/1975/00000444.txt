Benjamin Franklin said, “Wine is constant
proof that God loves us and loves to see us
hatter“

Unfortunately. some people aren‘t happy
with wine unless they can reduce its
appreciation to arguments akin tothe number
of angels that Can be accommodated on the
head of a pin.

To be sure. the glories of the grape are
many. The last thing we need. however. is
another self-proclaimed pundit swirling a
glass and talking about the Gay-Lussac
equation while claimingto perceive Gregorian
chants and the Rites of Dionysiusinthe wine.

Just as one need not be a botanist to

appreciates rose or a_meteorologlat to delight
in a sunset, you need not be an enologist to
enjoya glassol' wine. " ' . ‘_

It may be that wine snobs exist because
table wine. the kind of wine that increases the
pleasure ol‘ food (and hence the most
important category from an aesthetic
standpoint). is relatively ncwto America. For
tl long time. the pleasures at table winL have
been taken for granted by American l'ii‘milics
with strong Europciin heritages and by the
upper class. But until relatively recently. only
a minority of wines shipped in America were
ttthlc wines. Only in l9o9did tithlc wi tics mttkc
tip the majority of shipments. Sincc then. the
category has grown steadily both absolutely

intention correct t

es
procedures. And the wines themselves had '

natnes.- I .

Fortunately. the consumer hits discovered?

that enjoyment' ol‘ tithlc' wine is ’* not
complicated. In the tittit‘kctplith. it' it wincis
priced right. looks good. smells" good. and
tastes good. that is sufficient cause to bttyit.

What some wine drinkers liiit'cn‘t fcilll‘lt'tl is
that st riii ght-l‘orward st tiiidtirds ol‘ what looks.
