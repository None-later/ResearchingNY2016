'Al the beginning of the movie. there are. in-
deed. the plot possibilities of tracingthe “title
character's journey from the innocenoeand
pretentiousness of girlhood...“ ; however. the
director. Just Jaecltin, performs it cinematic

, and artistic coitus interruptus when he spills

all, his seeds of good plot and characterization
to achieve his primary goal of producing a
pleasing X-rated picture. So you see. in effect.
.the character" Emmanuelle is not “throwing off.
the societal sanctimony of forced virginal
purity": but rather. the actress Sylvia Kristal is
participating in a purely commercial venture.
Nothing more.

The flimsy plot that does emerge is
destroyed liy the director‘s apparent belief in:

the myth that the intensity ofthe climax (with .

which the movie unsatisfyineg ends) is ex-
clusively dependent upon the length. and not
the quality.“of 'the rising action. Thus the
movie rambles on for a boringeternity with its
generous portion of forceful. forced. and
l'orceless sex. Though the desecration of plot
would be enough. “Emmanuclle” is sure to
render itself totally impotent when it commits
the flaw of its kind- that of pretentiouslytak-
ing itself seriously. Thus. at theend. theviewer
must receive senior-citizen-stud Mario‘s ser-
men and the underrated benefits of group sex.
Although it was not “aesthetically pleas-
ing“. I did enjoy “Emmanuelle”. at times fin-
ding it phallically pleasing; though reading
Jeanne Saicwitt‘s‘ review beforehand almost

ruined a relatively decent porno llick.

Textbook Unreality

To the Editor:

After reading Ken Wax‘s column in the
Tuesday ASP. (Sooooo Much Studying... I
found myself compelled to elaborate on the
subject a little more. llind manyofmy friends
and acquaintances fitting intothe category of
those who are deathly afraid of getting bad
grades. therefore spending much of their time
with their faces buried in a textbook. If that is
all you people want out life then fine. Who am
I to sway your thinking? If youthink that is go-
ing to get you ajob and produce a successful
life. then fine. Keep on believing it.

On the other hand. take a moment aside and
think of your older friends who have already ‘
graduated from college. is that formula on
page 284 of their 500 level math course bring-
ing in the bucks and feeding them and their
families? I seriously doubt it. '

From my rather limited experience in the
"business" world (and c‘mon.that‘s what we‘re
all gettingthosc degrees for). l have foundthat .
no matter what type of work is involved. it re!
quiresmuch more knowledge about 'howpcoi'
ple (including yourselves) itct' and react. in. _‘

' different situations in order to succeed. l feel.
that this cannot be gained from limiting -'

yourself to a text-book; You have to "ex:

experiences. (Part _of this philosophy was

. . . And Overtime

To the Editor

A recent ASPhad a front pagestoryexpluin-
ing how Campus Securityis working overtime
to give out tickets to people who haven‘t
bought parking stickers. And according to
Assistant Security Director Joltn chighun.
the overtime pay is a “good investment". I‘m
sorry I don't share his glee overthe profitabili-
ty of the venture.

Every person with a car is supposed to
cough up“ four dollars for a registration
sticker. And if you don‘t. well. you get atickct
for live dollars. I‘d just like somebody to
tell me why.

What am I getting for my dollarsothcrthana
little sticker that costs seven cents to print up?
What services does my money avail to me?
Absolutely none. So why four dollars? Why
not one dollar? Why not twenty“! And where

   

SUNYA students because if- you don‘t goto‘

  
 
      

wtell us that the parking ticket overtime duty

will continue.,“to put emphasis onthe parking
problem." There is no parking problem. The
‘problem‘ is that people are refusing to pay
four . dollars. to Security for absolutely
nothing. ,

Lost Setter

To the Editor

While in an Arboretum near Locust Valley.
Long Island (Nassau County) a beautiful
setter. young. thin. came up to us. We played
with him and noticed that his or her two tags
had the University ofAlbany &then a number
printed. The dog came with us to the
gatekeeper. 'I'hc young man said “no. it wasn‘t
a lost dog. he comes here all'thc time."

When We camehomc. we thought that is
could be a lost dog since no one keeps a
current dog tag on a dog that isn‘t the correct
county tug.

Has anyone at your University lost a young
setter in the last few months? ll'so. wcsaw him
at Bailey Arboretum. Bayvillc Road at Fucks
Lane. Luttingtown. |..l.. N.Y. Lattingtown is
near Locust Valley. lhtilcy Arboretum isn‘t

' shown on maps bttt once you get to Lut-

tingtown people can direct yott.

Pro ‘Programming’

Neill Cohen‘s article in the ASl’ofScpt. 30
raises an interesting question relating to stu-
dent government. It concerned .lay Miller's
bill to put the Quad boardsout of business. I
don‘t feel that this is a desirable end. Around
here. we need all the “progrtunming” Wt: can
get. i
The bill would prohibit the granting ofdis-
counts to memberships card holders. The
effect of this for event-oriented groups is to
end membership cardsaltogct her. No one is to
give a group money ifthey can‘t get a rct urn on
their investment. The result is to deprive all
such groups of their only indcpcndcnt source
of capital. and to make all their events depen-
dant on their S.A. allocation. Eachquadllicn
loses the ability to program according to the
wants and needs ofthcir residents. These peo-
plc can no longer voluntarily provide capital
for any reason they wish. is this something
Council should do? You bet your soon isn't.

Let's look at Miller‘s arguments (loose use
ofthc-term) for his bill. First $66 is enough to
pay. ll‘that‘s the way youfccl. fine. don‘t buy a
quad card.

It is descritninatory to spend funds raised in

and they ncvcr will. Renders both your op-

Miller wouldn‘t hate introduced it. It does.

his name in the xlSl’( and his picture, too.).

around here. llut to do this . Jayis insuringthc
demise of a good pcrccntngc ol'the program-
ming of many of this cutnpus‘ student

How much damage should We have to‘ suffer
(in terms of even less patties. movies. etc.) in
order to boost .lay Miller's ego? i can impose
my own opinion only so far. lleuvetheanswer
to that question to you.

Editor's Note: The bill in question was

WSUA‘s budget for next semester, is still unknown. 'At Wednesday night's Central
Council meetingthe matter was returned to Finance Committee because there wane

feeling that the budget was not yet understood and had been railroaded thr'ough.Th‘e ‘ '

controversy surrounding the station is confusing. but the proper actions are clear. 

WSU A's FM application is out after years of misleading the students and student.
Association about its status. SA has recently submitted' a $2400 budget for next
semester compared to more than twice that this semester. The station received $23,000
last year. '

The SA executive branch should withdraw their budget proposal. It is none of their
business to propose a WSUA budget unless it is getting near December and the FM
application would be jeapordizcd without one. They should forget WSUA until the
station itself comes for its second semester budget. That would be more courteous.
reasonable and follows normal SA procedure. When WSUA‘s proposal reaches
Finance Committee. then SA should step in and make its feelings known. In any case.
Finance Committee should not consider the present budget. Wait until the semester
goes on a little bit; give WSUA a better chance tojudgethe udvertisingand engineering
situations. It is possible that the FCC will make a decision on WSUA-FM before the
end of the semester.

Although it is a little early to start heralding this issue. there is a need forexplanation
since the issue is in the public eye. The correct attitude towards next semester’s budget
could be called “essential for FM". That would mean cutting out all expenses which
Would not be essential forthe station to become FM. Therefore. any expense that could
be delayed should be delayed.

The used car analogy has become popular to explain the situation with the station’s
A M transmitters. lfthcy break down and are not repaired. they cannot be sold. lfthey

students more money than ifthey break down once and are fixed once. in other words.

that can be made should be. ‘ ‘

Any other cuts that won‘t affect a successful transition to FM should be made.
WSUA is not providing asignil‘icantservice as an AM carrier current station. exocpt
possibly for its sports coverage. It's budget request for next semester should reﬂect
their recognition of that fact. ‘
