Not so Happily Ever After

by Dianne Hebe
and Ellen Deutschman

In all areas of our sexist culture we are bom-
barded with the many different images of the
“second sex.“ The ,essence of “True
Womanhood? may be the sleek. foxy Black
Velvet model. Marilyn Monroe. Cher. Lois
Lane. Jackie Onassis, Cinderella. Doris Day
or perhaps the Virgin Mary. In contrast to the
images of men (usually either a good guy in
white or a heinous villain in black). female im-
ages are more confusing. On the one hand
there is the “fallen woman”, temptress or
whore. and on the other. the virgin goddess.
And in contrast to both of these, there is the

'juxtaposition of the happy homemaker.

mother and wife with the formidable
castrating bitch ﬁgure. Howey/er paradoxical
these images may appear. one theme
dominates—that of subservience and overall
inferiorin to men.

Children grow upto accept certainfantasies

and fairy tales which seem to reinforce these.

unhealthy images. Prince Charming sweeps

Snow White and Sleeping Beauty off their‘

respective feet and Cinderella is rewarded with
him for her humility and degradation. This is
the stuff that little girls are nurtured on along
_ with Barbie dolls and Suzy Homemaker
ovens. , '
There are two important children‘s ex-
emplars that transcend the fairy tale heros and
cartoon characters. but these. unfortunately
for girls. happen to be male. Santa Claus, that

jovial, paternal old man in red brings little‘

girls rag-dolls and little boys racing cars,
teaching them at an early age to accept
traditional social roles. Children are taught to
pray‘ to God the Father every night to bless
their dear souls and to send them onto heaven
when they have to die.

We recognize that fantasy and belief in the
supernatural is very important to thejuvenile
mind, but we are also aware of a tragic lack of
really positive female "providers" to compli-
me nt the missions of the Good Lord and Saint

Nick. Some children believe in fairy god-,

heroines to look up to and role models to

follow. But we wonder where this search can .

lead. To our mothers, certain female
professors. professional women. women ar'~
tists or musicians? We dare anyone to point
out a woman who is known for herintellectual
merits and who is admired for just that. We
maintain that she justdoesn't exist at this time
in that capacity. Perhaps the reason for this
lies partially in Vivian Gornick‘s description
of women in her essay Woman at Outsider:

Gay studies programs have already been
organized at» schools such as Barnard.

_ .-Rutgers. Kent State, University of Nebraska. .
' California State at Sacramento and Long

, Beach, NYU and others. Next semester, the

- French Department and the Conparative and

World Literature Department at SUNYA will
jointly offer a course entitled The »
Homosexua/ imagination in Uteru-
rure. 'We, spoke with Dr. Jack
Richtman, coordinator of the course, about
the appeal and f more of guy studies programs.
Q: Professor Richtman, you have recently
been elected National Co-Coordinator of Gay
Studies by the Modern Language Associa-
tion. What are gay studies aside from just the
study of homosexual literature?

‘ A: Many colleges and universities in the Un-
ited States have instituted gay studies
programs. As they exist today, they are either
cipline such as sociology/anthropology.-
language/Iiterature. or treated as an inter-
disciplinary study, depending mostly on the
professors involved and the requirements of
the students. In short, gay, studies grow out of
any and all disciplines. because this is an area
which has been too often ignored, when not
completely misrepresented and mis-
;understood.

Q: In what ﬁelds do you see speciﬁc and im-
mediate needs for gay studies?

.A: Several areas cry out for thorough. in-
‘vestigation. The history of gay liberation with
roots'in England, Germany and America in
the l9th century and even back to the French
‘ Revolution is one. Lesbian historyand its long
.heritage of ‘ feminist ant-establishment nt
movements which reach back as far as the
.f'emale natural healers, often known as
witches, in the middle ages; and the history of
ihomophobic orthodoxies. from the medieval
church right down to post-Freudian psy-
chology are others. These are urgent topics.
Q: You said that homosexuality has been mis-

 

‘ represented and misunderstood too long:
' How. in literature, for example. is this true?

A: Our education‘of censorship. silence and
prejudice in regard to homosexual love has
deprived a signiﬁcant number of citizens of
their rightful ‘ literary heritage and has
perpetuated-bias. ridicule and hatred. The
only portrayal of the homosexual life-style
that results is a composite counterfeit of the
syphilitic, debauched Perdoner in Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales. the limp-wristcd f'ops of
restoration drama. and the satanic pcderastsl
of‘the I890‘s. in other words. a satirical grotes-
que- .

Q: Then there is a homosexual tradition in
literature which has been suppressed?
AzThere is in fact a well~deﬁned homosexual
literary tradition with its own motifs, con-
cerns. influences and schools, running from
Plato‘s Phaedrut- to Mary Renault‘s ’I'lte
Charla/ear, from Strata's Mousa I’oidika to
Thomas Mann‘s Death in Venice. from Walter
l’atcr‘s Studies in the Renaissance to Yukio
Mishimu's Forbidden Colors. from the ItIy/ls
of 'l‘hcocritus to the lyrics of Rod MeKucn.
The love story of Abe/(1rd and Heloise is in-
teresting enough. but the medieval love story
of Ausonius and Paulinus is equally poignant
and deserves at least a nod in its direction. This
quite honorable literary tradition has been
almost conspiratorially hidden from view by
our critics. publishers and teachers. Our
failure to disseminate this knowledge. because
of a falso sense of propriety. has resulted in

numerous distortions.
Q: With regard to the course CWL 333/ FR

499 being offered next semester. to whom is it
being aimed and whom will it beneﬁt?

A: Anyone interested in literature.

Q: Ifthis course is successful. arethere plansto
enlarge the gay studies program here at
SUNYA‘.’ _

A: I see this as only a beggining. Given the in-
terest already expressed on our campus and
the areas such as those touched on above
which cry out for investigation. gay studies in
general can only expand.

 

made use of me. I am only a " a
myths. I am an existential stand-in. The idea
ofme is real—the temprress, the goddess. the
child. the mother—but I am not real.

The images of women our society has
created are false. The reason women have had
to look so long and hard for female cultural
heroines they can emulate is because a real,
“true woman" is not allowed to exist in our
culture as we know it. As women come to
realise this. they may have to create their own
heroines within a radically different social and
cultural atmosphere. This is indeed being done
now to a limited degree and there haveemerg-
ed several women leaders or heroines on asub<
cultural level that may eventuallyseepintothe
mainstream at some time in the future.

But to this date we have not found a hell ofa
lot of them.

and accordingto varsity Coach Bob
Munscy. Colgate will be tough.

“They have the same team as last

year at Colgate. 27-30. and haveint—
proved." said Munscy.

(‘onch lioh Munscy feels it‘s time
to start to put everything together.

"I don‘t think we're rcallythis bad.
Inn we have not been running \chI at
all.“ said Munsey. “Mentally. we
can‘t get over the shock that we‘re

getting ottr rails heat. We‘re ttot‘used'

lo tltttt."

Mnnscy also believes one of the
liqs to the team‘s disappointing per-
lormttnce this year is the loss of
lctterman Steve Arthur.

“Arthur not going out this year
rcnlly lutrt us,“ moaned Munscy.
"He would have been tlpihcl‘cttliclld
of licntnatt and would have givett as
three strong guys. As a matter of
fuel. with him. we‘d have probably
gone into last Saturday‘s meet un-
dclcnted."

Last Saturday. the team went up
to Williams College fora triangular.
Incl udtng University of Vermont. ex-
pcctillg to hcill the host anti have
problems with the Universityof Vet‘-
moot.

“We Went ttftcr the wrong team.“
said Munsey. “Our man stayed with
Vermont runners who broke out car—
ly and set It blistering pilot: for the
first mile of the race in 4:40. Nine
men were bunched up in the front
alter the mile as runners got into the
golf course. Here several of our guys
began dropping back and Williams'
tncn began moving up. On the se-
cond ll/g mile loop ol'the golfcourse,
Williams moved up their 3. 4. 5 men
and took the meet."

Carlo (.‘lterttbino. who led almost
the whole way. was outsprinted in
the last 200 yards and was beaten by
Williams“ Brian Kolb. Kolb‘stime of
25:03 and Cherubino's time of 25:13
were the second and third fastest
times on Williatns‘ track.

Chris Burns finished a close third
(25:l3) as Albany beat Vermont 26-
29. Williams beat both Albany and
Vermont by identical scores of 25-
33.

Cherubino's win against Vermont
gave him II for his career and ties
him for third on the all-time Albany
State wins list behind Tom Robin-
son (20) and Joseph Keating (l5).
and ties him with Dennis Hackett.

A lack of a solid passingattaelt has ,

also hurt the Danes. Albany has

completed an anemic 27% of its

admits he could do as well.

On the‘defensive side. the Danes
have looked good. They have yielded
54 points in four games with 33 com-
