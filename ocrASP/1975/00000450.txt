lacrosse, , ‘s not a varsity sport in
the'l'alllf said Bataglia. "Tlteteam
has lost few players from last year's
lvartity team and should be tough.”

Thirty players compromise the fall ‘
team, and accordingto Bataglia. the

purpose of fall lacrosse is for the
players to improve skills. do some
running, and keep in shape. “I think
we'll win all the games left on our
schedule”, said Bataglia.

According 'to Bataglia. fall

lacrosse has had a few pleasant sur-
prises. ‘ ‘ ‘
“ ndy Slotnik has been doing
most of the goaltending. and he is
vastly improved over last spring,"
said Bataglia. “Bill Small. a new-
comer. is a deﬁnite contender for a
position on the varsity."

During practices, the team con-
centrates on drills.

“We work on clearing, the fast
break. and man up situations." ex-
plained Bataglia. “Clearing is mov- .
ing the ball out of your zone, and aI
last break resembles a breakaway in
hockey. Man up situations are,
again. similar as in hockey. because a
team must play Shorthanded when
penalized.
