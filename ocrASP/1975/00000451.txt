Danes Not Up to Par;
Injuries a Problem

by Craig Bell - ‘

The Albany Great Danes football
team ﬁnds itself with a week off and
maybe that is just what they need,
before resuming next week with a
tough game against Southern Con-
necticut. v

Albany. although owning a J-l
record, has not played up to its
potential thus far and as Dane coach
Bob Ford said “is not a good football
team yet.”

Yet is the key word. The Danes on
offense have virtuallythe same unit
as last year with the exception of
graduated guard Mike Basia and
tight end 'l‘om cleary. However, the
way they have been playing. it would
seem that they are a first year unit.

Some of the problems’ean belinlt-
ed to injuries that have plagued the
Danes all year. As a result State
hasn't been able to string together
one consistent offensive unit.

, Both linemen 'l' y Curran and Bob
,Sheuehenko, who suffered off
season, knee injuries. have been slow

to recuperate and have been

and has been sorely missed as a
runner and blocker.

‘l‘he tight end situation is the
problem that vexcs Ford the most.
Albany has employed three tight
ends, Pat O'Neil. liob I’aeglow. and
Iiob llaxter.

"Thus far it has been a flip of the
coin." said Ford. "l‘acgiow is the
better line blocker but Baxter. last

year's split end, is the better pass,

receiver and down-field blocker."
For the sake of establishing some
consistency. the job belongs to lies.
ter for now. accordingto Ford. Thu
leaves the split end spot 'to Jim
Pollard and Don Whitely.
“Both have been doing an ex-

Bill Schieffelin. “Our passwork was
very good. and we played intelligent-

Yr . , ' ,
Sehieffelin was not pleased with .

the team's second half play.

“We lost theis'hutout because of a
defensive: mix-up." explained
Schieffelin.“0ur play was not .good
in the secondi ‘ half, but that's
probably because we were ahead. 5-
0. and our players just let up."

'Selca scored Albany‘s lone second .

period goal 28 minutes in. five
minutes after Dave Eckwall broke
the shutout. -
“Overall, I cannot complain too
loudly.“ said Schieffelin. “We got
out of the game with no major in-
juries. and it was a good warm-up for
the big Keane State game this Satur-
day. at l p.m.“ '
t‘lt was also a satisfying win
because Binghamton barely beat
them last week. 2- l. at Binghamton."
Keane State is 5-2. and among
those teams receiving votes in the
national polls which do not differen-
tiate between Division I, [Land Ill
terms. ' -

" “ We expect a very tough. physical.

and well-skilled team," said
Schicflelin. “last year they were

Keane State is one ofthc
best soccer schools in the area. As
Sehiel‘felin says. they are very tough

number eight in the State rankings.

This should be the best soccer

and will serve as an excellent preview

of the One-onto game Wednesday. A
win will probably place Albany
among the top 20 ' 'h )015 in the nu-
tion. and the top. in the state.

Fun support is a key, asillustraled

Indians Scalp Batmen, 10-7

“It makes you mad when you
score that many runs and lose."

coach. Bob Burlingame. after
watching his Danes bow to Siena.
Iii-7. at the Indians‘ home ﬁeld
Wednesday.

But it was more than just being
outscored. It was the six Albany
errors that were primarin responsi-
ble for the Danes' downfall. “Did we
have that asaay’l". asked

Burlingame.

They did. In fact. eight ofthe ten
Siena runs were unearned. Ironical-
ly. the Danes displayed some
remarkableﬁelding plays carlyinthe

game that cut off two Indian rallies. ‘

In the home first. the hosts had
grabbed a 1-0 lead off Dane starter
Bob Kronenbcrger and had runners
on first and second with none out.
Tom Paradise then smacked what
appeared to be a run-scoring single
through the left side. More

Dave Smith then smashed a wick-
ed shot to left which Cooke spearcd
in the air, before firing to third to
double off the runner there. The
bang-bang play seemed to take
something out of the Indians and
they did no further scoring that
frame

In the next inning. with Bill
Donnelly on first, Ray Miller lineda
single to left. When leftl'iclder John
lrace seemed to havetrouble picking
the ball up, Donnelly took off for
third. lruccthen recovered and made
a perfect throw to Jim Willoughhy to
cut him down and kill yet another
rally.

But the roof fell in in the third.
when the lndians tallied four times
off Kronenberger with the aid of
three Dune miscues. to take a com
munding 5-0 lead. Paradise had the
only hit of the inning, when be

Albany. meanwhile. was a ‘ hav-

the first three innings without allow-
ing the Danes a bit, before he run
into trouble in the fourth.

Jeff Silverman started it off by
drawing a walk on a 3-2 pitch. When
Willoughhy and Jeff Breglio per‘
formed similarly (also on f nil-count
pitches). the Danes had a legitimate
threat. lrace then capitalized on the
opportunity by slamming a shot
through the hole in left for the first
Dane hit and also their first run as
Silverman crossed. A.succeeding
