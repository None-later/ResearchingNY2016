I Feature:

by Madeline Gutman

i would seem that any com-

pany that could adopt an

emblem like Price
Choppers—Miss Libertyona coin, her
head split open with an axe (Price
Chopper, get it?)~should be able to
discourage shoppers trom un-
necessary contact with rthe store
security torce. What methods they
must employ when conironting
shopliiters! With their emblem
embedded lirmty in mind, i imagined
axewielding apemen stalking the
aisles hunting tor the last-lingered
crooks, so it was with considerable
trepidation that Stephanie and I re-
quested an interview with security per-
sonnel at the Madison Avenue store.

A Great Transformation

"Joe Valek, lront oilice," barked the
store manager. Two men strode down
the aisle, looking grim and prepared
tor an arrest. One was white, the other
black, both were young, well-built and
utterly intimidating.

“Joe, would you like to talk to these
two girls?"

The white man glared at us with in»
tense, piercing green eyes, his
moustache bristling as he nodded
slightly. Clarence was a bit less lear-
some, but he, too, nodded curily and
said nothing. "This is Madeline Gut—
man and Stephanie Abrams. They
would like to interview you tor a story.

didn't have enough money, l'm out ot
work". Meanwhile, they're stealing
cigarettes or cosmetics! it you're steal-
ing ‘cause you're hungry, that's one
thing—we've even had cases where a
store manager would pay tor iood tor
someone who was really unable to buy
enough iood to eat—but when you're
hungry you don't need cosmetics.
Yeah, the problem's getting very bad
in tact, there's going to be a sym-
posium on shoplitting at the Hyatt
House in a couple oi weeks, to talk
about it."

"J oe, what do you do with the people
you catch shoplitting alter you bring
them up here?"

"First oi all, let me explain
something. A lot oi people don't know
what kind oi crime shoptitting is. We
got some kids who don't even know it's
a crime at all. Well, lecture them. We
could give a kid a criminal record that
would keep him out oi law school and
out ot a lot ot other prolessions. We
usually try to avoid prosecuting
whenever possible, and we almost
never do tor a lirst ottense.“

Joe went on to explain the depart-
ment set-up,"Wecall it Loss Prevention
rather than Security. We're trying to
personalize the department and get rid
ol the cop image. We have a couple ol
guys on the tloor or the catwatks—did
you notice the small windows above
the meat department? 'l'here’s a
catwalk behind them. We have people
sit there to watch the aisles. Also, we
just put in that doubte-deckeroilicein

 

 

 

 

 

the manager. This remark precipitated
one ol the greatest human translor-
mations in recorded history. Joe's tight-
ly set jaw slackened, the eyes soltened,
even twinkled a bit, his lists unclench-
ed and he smiled. Clarence let out a
short breath, took his hands lrom his
pockets and grinned.

"Sure," said Joe. "Come up tothe ol—
lice.“

Located above the meat department,
the security oilice is about the size at a
walk-in closet, ideal tor interrogations
Since there is no way to avoid eye con
tact Without staring at yourleet. Joe sat
perched on his desk, while Clarence
stood leaning against the door.

"l'm Joe Valek, l‘m the district Loss
Prevention Manager and this is
Clarence Uallou, the store Loss
Prevention Manager. You girls are
trom State, huh. We've been waiting tor
someone to come lrom the University.
Students are a big problem here," said
Joe.

"that‘s what we were wondering.
Has the shoplilting problem gotten

worse recently, with all the economic
dilticulties everyone’s having how's"

"()h yea h, delinitely. But the thing is,

we get these people in here, and they
give us all kinds ol excuses like, "i

loe ottered us each a cigarette, and lit
one tor himsetl.

"How do you go about apprehen-
ding a suspect?”

"Well, you can stop someone in the
store it you've got reason to suspect
that he's not going to pay lorsomething
he's picked up, but that's a pretty
dangerous practice, so we usually wait
until he's checked out. You can be
pretty sure though , that it a guys got a
steak shoved down his pants, ora razor
in his armpit, that he's not planning to
pay tor it."

I l was still Intrigued With the catwalk
idea. I kept thinking ot a Cinema down
in the sewers ol lstanbul watching the
bad guys, while theinnocenl go about
their business unaware ot the silent
vigil below. it seemed very dramatic

Would it be possible tor us to work
with you tor a day on the catwalks'i’“
My own question startled me as much
as their response.

"Sure. How about Friday? About
noon'."

ing open on the toddler seat in her cart
and a package oi cheese was propped
up next to it. "Cmon lady, steal it
already. Cmon, put it in the bag. Let's
go." said Clarencein a hoarse whisper.
From our vantage point, we could see
the top oi her handkerchieted head
and the contents ot her shopping cart.
"Watch her," said Clarence. "Watch
what she does with the cheese. Hight
into the bag. Hey Joe, spot this one?"

Joe, Steph, and Hon Stone, another
security agent, were huddled at
another wmdow along the catwalk.
"Yeahj said Joe, "is Hatph down
there?

'Yeah, i think he sees her."
