,' ‘ does a divorced, middle-
 Rorneo tind [unwell be-
.ing married to a gtassyeyed
woman by the l'ustice’yot the Peace in
Painted Post, New York? Just ask my
lather.

We Americans love marriage, but
we hate it. Statistics show that.
although we have one at the highest
divorce rates in the wortd, we are also
one at the most marrying nations
around in tact divorcees marry oll
even taster than those who have been
single all of their lives What is this, a
case at mass ambivalence toward the
institution ol marriage, or an indication
that Americans are as crazy as the rest
ol theworld thinksthey are? Again, ask
my lather, Fred, who two months a"

became a part ol those statistics.

Although it might seem logica.

assume that it‘s easier the second time
around, Fred’s case is one that would
tend to belie «that assumption. ln tact,
alter a two-yearengagement tilled with
countless snatus, setbacks and second
thoughts, he is more likely to insist that
the second time is much tougher

 

Take, tor instance, the time when he
and histianoeeloan lirst began check-
ing into getting a marriage license
Although they had been talking about
marriage tor about a year, that's all
they had done—talk about it. When
Joan, who had been putting this ott tor
as long as possible, ﬁnally got up the
courage to ask her doctor about get-
ting a blood test, he exploded

"What do you want to get married
lor'." he asked her, horriﬁed

From there, he launched into a tirade
about the evils ot marriage. His advice,
much to Fred's chagrin, was to torget
such notions Instead he suggested
that she "live with the guy." He knew
lots ot couples, he said, who had lived
together quite happilyand then ruined
neir bliss by tying the knot. "'l'his," he
named Joan sternly, 'could easily
zappen to you"

As it that weren’t enough, any
remaining vestiges of hope my lather
entertained were destroyed shortly
therealter, along with his honeymoon
plans.

We hadreservations tor aCaribbean
cruise that December," he said, "but

the boat we were supposed to go on got
put in dry dock."

The travel agency then gaveits bilk-
ed passengers the option ol takingthe
same cruise, but on a British or llallan
boat.

"1 picked the British one," says Fred,
"but then that one was signed out tor a
special educational tour."

By that time, Fred had had it: "‘l'hey
ottered the choice ol a third cruise, but
1 said 'no.’ Besides, loan was thinking
about the Bermuda Triangle by then."

Almost one year later, Fred andloan
are no longer in the single minority. A
weekend tripto the Finger Lakes . . . an
impromptu ceremony . . . winery tours

had linally done it, espectally loan.

' lhat weekend we went away 1 tell
likel was ruining her whole lite," says
l‘red, "She went into deep depression."

Despite this, Fred claims he enjoyed
the whirlwind weekend. But how does
it leel to go on a honeymoon at age 49?

Well,” explains Fred, .1 let my hair
grow a little bit and 1 got these racing
glasses, so 1 lelt more like 35]

Painted Past

Still, Fred sees himsell as more ol a
homebody than a swinger. "I‘m not the
type ol person that likes livrng alone,
he said.

At one point, loan had him question-
ing this sell image. Repeatedly, she
told Fred he would probably never get
married because he liked his treedoni
too much. He soon began to wonder it
this might be true.

"But." he said, "I realized. . .
Joan who was unsure."

Since her divorce a lew years ago.
Joan had successluily managed a
house and two teenage kids on her
own.

1 think she just hated givmg up her
treedom, says Fred, But l don t think
she regrets getting married.

All around, the black cat sky is bath-
ed in ribbons ol light. Grey-brown rec-
tangles loorn, glowing in the dark. lt is
the panorama at a toyland; a giant size
board game. Only the rumble ol the
moving cars and the rotating colors ol
the street lights give hints ol lite.

From the rear at 136 State Street, one

The Wellington Hotel. Set in downtown
Albany, in the rnidsl ol the Slate
buildings and the new mall, the
students enjoy both dormitory lite and

"No way!" exclaimed Hita Makela, a
junior transter lrom Hockland Corn-
munity College, when asked it she
would like to move to an uptown dorm.
"‘We know when we have it better.
Sure, it would be convenient but they
would have to move this whole
building over there." She explained
that at the Wellington, she had a
private room, her own bath, and the
combined advantages ol privacy and
hall livrng. "ll anybody is going by, I
can call them in aridl have my privacy,
too,‘ she said.

Here we do not have the psy-
chological barrier at a suite door," said
l‘red Lille, one ol the H.A.’s in the
Wellington. There is better interaction
between an H.A. and the section
because ol the hall system ol rooms. the
deed, walking through the halls, one
could see that most at the room doors
were lell open and many students
wandered lrom one room to the next.

My lirst reaction was guarded op-
liniisrn,’ said Husso. As with many ol
the lranslers who live in the hotel, he
was skeptical about a living situation in
which he would be isolated lrom came
pus lite. "But you start out With 200
lriends which is great lor translers who
come here not knowrng anyone. l like it
here much more and would delinilely
stay another year."

Husso and Smith listed somehol the
advantages ol the Wellington dorm
and they were easily seen. "I have the
meal plan here and the lood is very,
very good," said Husso. the load, an
alternative to FSA cooking, is supplied
by Kaye's caterers. Only dinner is
served and there is a choice ol deli-
lype lood tor lood cooked outside ol the
hotel and brought in. However, the
Wellington kitchen IS being
remodelled and lood will soon be
cooked on the premises.

Guier Knibloe, another Wellington
HA, explained that approximately
one-third ol the students eat uptown,
onelhird are on the Wellington dinner
plan, and onelhlrd are on no meal
plan al all. She added that because at
its central location, sludenls never
have trouble tinding places to eat.

Bob Levrn, Hesidenl Director ol the
dorm, explained an added advantage
ol the Wellington lood service. The
Wellington restaurant will soon be
open to the public and a larger menu
will be ollered. Students on the plan
will have meal tickets valued at $2.70.

Phone service is another major
ditlerence lrom uptown lite. At the
Wellington, each student has a phone
in his room but can only receive in-
comingcallswhichgothroughlhelob-
by switchboard. 'l'o make calls, the stu-
denl must go down to the lobby and
use the pay phones there. To accom-
modate lor this, the Wellington
residents usually have their lriends
call them. "You lind out who your
lriends really are," joked Levin. 'l'here

has been a suggestion ol installation ot‘

a central phone in each hall, bul no
plans have been made yet. The phone
service has caused lew problems as
the hotel provides 24—hour message
service, said Knibloe.

"We have the best ol two worlds,”
said Levin and all the students l talked
to agreed. Lille commented on "the
loyalty in the building. When we are
Wrilllltg tor a bus, we wait together."
hven the bus rides are enjoyable, the
students agreed. they give extra time
tor relaxation and socializing.

All the students questioned com-
iiienled on the parties held in the
Wellington. 'lhe parties are initiated
by the kids and we've been having
about one a week," said Lille Starting
With one keg, the Wellington has also
had b’dsli'partles and parties with two
or more kegs. Last week, they held a
Wine and cheese party and about lilly
uptown students came to it. "They like
it oll the quads,“ Levin said, Smith
agreed With this: "Kids uptown like to
come down here. lt gives them a
chance to get away, too." Signs in the
elevator advertise the upcoming "First
Annual Wellington Fesl' which lhree
ol the resrdenls are planning.

Overall, negative comments are
minimal. l‘l‘ullt the large private rooms
