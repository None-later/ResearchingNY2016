This is the story ot a once-popular,
now crumbling and condemned hotel
in downtown Albany.

Built in 1867, the Kenmore Hotel
was a lavish live—story, 175 room
building situated on North Pearl and
Columbia streets. 'l'oday it is lavish no
more. The marbled steps that once
upon a time carried you up, into, and
through two revolving doors revealing
the rich Victorian decor ot the lobby,
now transport you into its dark, damp
soiled remains. 'l‘ime has taken its toll,
over a centuries worth.

"Back in the twenties this was the
social place to come", explains Hebert
Murphy, grandson oi the original
owner. "Poweriul people irom the state
legislator; like Senator Uunnagin (a
powertul republican oi the era,‘stayed
here on their trips tothe capitol." 'l'hese

The Palace last It! a 

by William Hughes

‘l'here are really two grand ladies oi
the corner ot North Pearl and Clinton.
One, is the theater, and the other is the
attractive grandmother who oversees
the operation ot the hugh showplace.
She stands majestic, towering over
North Pearl Street, the last survivor ot a
noble tamily which included the
Strand, the Laland and the Playhouse.
She is thetri-city area's only remaining
grand showhouse. She is truly a
palace.

W hen the Palace 'l‘heater was open-
ed on October 23, l93l, it wasthethird
largest theater in the world. Originally
owned underthe auspices oi the HKO
group, the Palace began her days as a
vaudeville house. Nearly 3,700 peo-
ple in white ties and tails and evening
gowns llocked to hear Mayor'l'hatcher
and Lt. Governor Lehman speak in the
street, there were mobile units carry-
inq gigantic spotlights which made the
corner oi Clinton and North Pearl as
light as day. There were also sound
trucks which carried the voices ot the
orators to the thousands oi every day
tolks who were unable to gain en-
trance to the theater tor it’s gala open-
ing.

the interior ot the theater was
described by the newspapers oi the
day in the words oi it's designer John
thereon, “The Palace is Austrian Baro-
que, the classic name lor beauty and
warmth". The theater was designed ior
comtort, aesthetic loveliness and
acoustic periection.

today the Palace is essentially the
same as it was when Ann Harding's
tealure "Devotion" launched that
premiere season. the entrance ioyer
has the same gilded cornices and ceil-
ing, though much oi the gild has been
replaced with a more practical creme
paint. A minstrel and two Greek busts
stare down on the patrons as they pass
through the glass doorstntothelobby.

the lobby is enormous with real
crystal chandeliers and a number oi
historic murals painted by two
budapest artists, Andrew Karely and
Jules Aarel. hach mural took the bud-

ding Michelangelos eight weeks to
complete. The walls are a pearl tex-
tured creme color with gilded trim,
'l'wo ornate stairways lead upstairs to
the balcony and the Greek columns.
The steps are oi blood red marble and
covered by plush blue carpets. Much
oi the lobby turniture is made oi the
same marble and gold. From the
wrought iron railings, the comings and
goings oi the people tar below in the
lobby can be observed. From this van—
tage point, socialites and gossip
columnists could monitor the creme oi
Albany society as they tliited here and
there on their way inside to the velvet
seats.

the "house" itsell is still enormous,
seating 2,795. A $250,000.00 renova-
tion in 1960 decreased seating capacil
ty trom 3,695 while increasing leg
room .noticeably. “the balcony
stretches two thirds oi the way to the
stage and there isn't one bad seat. An
oval shaped skyscrpe is still over the
52 toot long stage. Cupids and more
rococo trim give the dome ceiling the
appearance of the drawing room oi
Buckingham Palace. Another
chandelier oi Scandinavian crystal
twinkles nearly six stories above the
tloor.

besides the enumerable works oi art,
the theater also had many technical in-
novations, several oi which are still
tunctioning today. 'l'he orchestra pit
still rises and is very popular with per-
iormers today. On opening night in
1931, Hay 'l'urner sat at the world's
largest organ. The "Mighty Wurlitizer”
is gone today, but the swivel platiorm it
rested on is still in existence,

the thousands oi lights are con-
trolled by a 1931 General Electric
electron tube board about the size oi a
telephone switchboard which replac.
ed banks upon banks oi the
traditional rheostats. the electron
board was designed by AL. Bailley
ot Schenectady tor the Palace.

the ventilation system, also ot

original design, consists oi an air
cleaner and reirigeration unit which
completely replaces every cubic toot
oi air in the Palace every ten minutes.

“the same system has operated without
major detect since the theater opened
it's doors. A new heating system was
added in the sixties.

For tour decades the Palace was
owned by St Fabian. Mr. Fabian was a
entrepreneur who also owned the
Leland and several other deluxe
theaters in Schenectady, Troy, New
York City and various sites in Penn-
sylvania. Oi the other nine theaters
which composed r'abian's tri-city em—
pire, only the Palace stands today.

During the sixties, the urban core oi
Albany began to deteriorate and this
marked the end oi the once bustling
downtown theater district. Crowds
began to thin as the crime rate climber
in Arbor Hill.As the Leland met the
wrecking ball, as the Strand was
replaced with a parking lot, the Palace
began to show cheap, violent and ex-
ploitation tilms in a dire ellor! to boost
box ottice attendence. By 1969,
houses were seldom lull and the
Palace became a congregating spot

tor young toughs. Racial tensions Were,

high. On February 2, a movie called
"Uptight" was shown which dealt with
street riots and police brutality. Aiter
the tealure, there was an outbreak ot
violence which led to the death oi
seventeen year old David Hisgen.
Soon alter that untorlunate episode, a
$650,000.00 law suit was tiled agianst
Fabian interests. On September 6,
1969 the Palace announced it was
closing it's doors.

Less than twenty—tour hours later,
Mayor Corning announced the city oi
Albany had purchased the theater at
the unbelievable price 0t $90,000.00
ior use as a civic auditorium. it would
also serve as a home tor the Albany
Symphony Orchestra and ior com-
munity concerts. Mayor Corning ap-
pornted Mrs, hveylyn Knolls as
manager.

Mrs. Knolls says that the operation oi
the theater is a time consuming but
very salislying job. She commented
that perhaps the toughest job at the
Palace was making sure that the mar—
quee was correct. A recent Kung l"u
movre was billed as "Maritial Arts

 

Revealed".

Mrs. Knolls termed the theater “A
lovely old lady who must befpreserved,
because there will soon come a day
when there will be no more like
her".besides the number oi deluxe
theaters which have tallen ‘vtctim, to
the wrecking ball in Albany Syracuse
and Schenectady have also torn down
their grand houses to make room tor
urban renewal. Mrs. Knoll tell that
Mayor Corning showed tremdous in-
sight in purchasing the theater as it is a
member ot an endanged species and
may be the only one olthedying breed
leit outside oi New York City. She said
that the upkeep oi the theater was a
constant job due to it’s age.

'l'he man who oversees most ot the
work done at the Palace is Bob
O'Grady, a SUNYA theater arts major.
blob is in charge oi the upkeeping oi
the grand old lady. He and his live man
crew must continually sweep, vacumn,
mop and primpthe old gal up. He said
tollowing each concert, it take almost
three hundred man-hours to put the
theater in order. The theater also
is a non-proﬁt making organization
and oiten barely breaks even oi parlor-
mances. He said that the $75000 ren-
tal tee barely covers the costs oi the
people employed by the theater. the
labor costs, however, and upkeep are
considerably cheaper than the
purchase oi a new. multi-million dollar
center which cities like Syracuse had
to shell-out tor. _

"We're really just interested in let-
ting the community have a good time",
says Bob. "Our only objection is
against people bringing in beverages
in bottles and cans". Bob and several
otl duly Albany policeman comprise
the security stall whose main job is to
prevent injuries to theaters patrons.

Aarron Mch‘lroy is another
employee oi the Palace. He is one ot a
number ot Human Hesources Per-
sonnel who have been working this
past summer at the Palace painting
and returnishing. "They don't build
them like this any more" says Aarron
leaning on his mop, looking out over
Albany's palatial theater.
