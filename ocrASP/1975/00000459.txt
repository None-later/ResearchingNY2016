by The College Press Service
he latest‘ victims‘ at anti-
T discrimination laws may be
women's studies departments
which were begun in the past tew
years to combat the male bias oi
traditional university curriculums.

The Women’s Studies College at the
State University oi New YorktSUN Y) at
bultalo was advised last month that
their live all-women courses must be
discontinued or they will “simply be
barred" trom the University course
otterings in January, 1976.

The courses, which teature enroll-
ment "tor women only," violate the
Department oi Health, Education and
Weltare Title IX guidelines and'the
New York State Human Rights Law, ac-
cording to SUNY Counsel and Ex-
ecutive Vice President Albert Somit.

'l‘he 'l'itle 1X regulations, which took.

ettect July 2i, prohibit discrimination

in any educational institution which'

receives iederal tunds.

but the Women's Studies College at
SUNY is not accepting the ruling
without a tight. "We are not discon-
tinuing women's studies classes," a
department coordinator claimed.
“'l‘hat’s what the administration would
like to think."

Spokeswomen tor the women's
college teeI that the discrimination
against men serves a legitimate
educational purpose. "‘l'he selective
use at all women's classes is tun-
damental to our educational growth; it
is the unique element ot our program,
and the toundation ot our strong,
national impact on the development ot
other women's studies programs," a
Women's Studies College newsletter

 I Backfire on Women

claimed.

Women's Studies College members
ieel that their program is a " vital attir-
mative action program tor women," ac-
cording to their newsletter. Women's
College members also accused the
University at being "incredibly lax in
developing and entorcing an attir-

mative action program tor women. it is”

obvious," they stated, "that the ad-
mistration is misusing legislation
designed to protect and advance the
educational opportunities torlwomen
in order to threaten the lite ol a
program on this campus committed to
those very goals."

Not For Women Only

A spokeswoman tor the Women's
Studies College said that SUN Y at But-
talo is not the only women's depart-
ment which otters courses “tor women
only," but administrators at other un-
iversity women's departments agreed
that the practice ot keeping men out ot
classes was both illegal and sell—
deteating.

"ldon‘t think it would be consistent
with the philosophy we have here," a

spokeswoman tor the women‘s studies
department at Kansas University said.
"We think educating men is a basic
part oi people being able to change the
whole social situation."

"Men aren’t really encouraged to
take classes in our department," a
taculty member oi the women’ 5 studies
department at Sacramento State Un-
iversity said. “The classes are set up tor
women, with a teminist perspective.
they just don't attract that many men.

 

 

The administration is misusing legislation designed to
protect and enhance the educational opportunities for
women in order to threaten the life ofa program on this
campus committed to those very goals.

but it would be discriminatory to ex-
clude them altogether."

One argument in tavor ot all—women
courses is that women would teel more
treedom to speak out about their
shared problems without men in the
classroom. Women's studies taculty
members sympathized with this teel-
ing but most tell those problems should
be attacked outside the Classroom. "it's
usetul tor consciousness-raising
groups but not necessarily in class,"
the Kansas University spokeswoman
added.

Other women's studies departments
have tound it unnecessary to consider
ottering all-women classes. "It's dis-
criminatory and we couldn't have
done it here," Judy Wanhala, an ad-
ministrative associate at the University
ot Minnesota women's studies depart-
ment said. "but a lot ot courses end up
being all women anyway. I taught a
course last summer tor 30 people and
there were no men in it at all."
