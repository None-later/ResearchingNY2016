The Lot

by Sharon Denise Williams
' he listened as she saw the
5 children running and playing
. in the empty lot. They darted
between the broken glass, laughing
and screaming happily. The lot was
surrounded by tour large buildings
that kept it lrom the view oi the street. in
tact, the only way to the lot is through
the alley between the two buildings.
Many ol the people who live in the
building throw their garbage trom the
windows into the lot so besides the
wood, glass, and pieces ot metal, there
are pieces ol paper, garbage bags and
loodl all over the place, making it a
perlect home tor rats, roaches and
other stray animals, such as dogs, cats
and people who haven't a home to live
in or lood to eat.

First Only A Few

Ever since the older kids look over
the playground down the block, all the
younger kids come to the lot. First
there were only one or two, but now
there are a lot more. From her titth lloor
window she could look down and see
the whole lot, and everyday she hears
them playing.

She looks down and watches a little
girl that reminded her oi hersell when
'she was young. The little girl walked

big pieces ot wood. She stopped to pick
up a broken doll, when a tamin ol rats
came out lrom under a pile ot wood.
The largest rat stopped and showed his
teeth as the other ratstled to salety. The
girl screamed and ran. A boy that was
near by, chased the rat until it dis-
appeared under another pile ol gar-
bage. His lriends cheered him and
then went back to playing.

Alter playing hide and seek through
the broken down cars that someone lett
there, they started to play a game at
war. The boys broke up into teams and

the girls sat on the side and cheered

them on. First pebbles llew lrom side to

One boy got up to throw a rock and

broken glass and wood with nails stick-

silence, and then a high blood curdl-
ing scream came trom the boy. He was
titted up by one at the older boys in the
group. Blood poured lrom all over his
body. His blood vessels and hunks ol

A Gruesome Sight

Some ol his lriends ran and got an
older boy. The older boy looked at the
younger boy and tightened up his lace
at the gruesome sight. He looked
again, turned and ran tor help.

The younger boy howled with pain
as he called tor his mother. His young
playmates watched in terror, tor they
had never seen anything as terrible as
this. Someone in the crowd that had

She was veryupset, speaking last, so
that .no one could understand her, and
crying. "it seems to me that she's scar-
ing the boy even more," the girl said to
hersell.

'l'he ambulance took about torty-tive
minutes to get there, and while they
were coming, the boy cried in paid as
the people just stood around watching
him. When they got there, they titted
him into the ambulance, taking his
mother with him and drove away. The
people now started to walk away, talk-
ing about what had happened. Soon
the lot was empty.

She stayed inthe window tor awhile,
then got tired, and started to go in,
when she saw a movement in the lot. A
little boy who had been out there
earlier, had returned. He was walking
around slowly, picking up pieces ot
broken concrete and throwing them at
the buildings. He then lound a piece ol
wood and took some old rusty nails
lrom a larger piece ct wood and
hammered them together. Then he
took a piece ot paper and stuck it on the
nail. He took his homemade sailboat
and placed it in a puddle ot muddy
water, pushing it with his linger.

She looked at this and wondered it
she would ever get out ot this place,
with its rats and roaches, killings and
raping, and empty lots, likethe oneshe
was looking at. She wondered it her
child would be that little boy when he
got to be ten, eleven, or twelve? She
looked at all this with a passionate hate.
to bring someone into a placetikethis,
without being able to leave and live
somewhere else, and give it a better
lile, was it lair? She looked down at her
swollen stomach and leared tor the lite
ol her unborn child.

New England
Parting

by Mabel Pruden
he sumac in the swamp was
T crimson again, orange
bittersweet vines wove their
way up sturdy trees. Apples and plums
in neat baskets beckoned trom road-
side stands. 'l'he llame ol tail was bur-
ning over the wooded hills again as
she drove upthe autumn road, carelul»
ly keeping her thoughts centered on
her driving and away lrom her destina-
tion. The countryside looked much as it
had three years ago. Only then she
had been driving the other way.

She parked the car in tront ot the two
story house that looked vaguely
angular, sprawling this way andthat as
it designed by some giant child who
had become angry with his block
buildings; who in sudden temper had
tlung them away, to leave them on this
earth carpet.

She paused a moment on the sagg»
ing stoop in the UCtober sunlight, ab-
sorbing the warmth, listening to the
trilling ot the tall insects. i wonder it
they know ol their sure death She
thought. is this theirtinai cry, or do they
even know that these are their last
days. Perhaps it's just the angle ol the
light that changes the tempo ol their

song.

Abruptly she turned the door knob,
and as she entered the dimness ot the
kitchen, she saw his sisterin the rocker.

“Well, you've come back", shesaid.

Later with the sister gone, alone with
Saul, she wondered why she had
come back. She looked down at him,
lying detenseless in the double bed,
and tell a taint revulsion. How remote
she lelt trom Saul's lile. How remote
she had always tell. She went back out
into the kitchen to clear away her plate
and lork, washing them slowly in the
agate sink.

the room had an odor ot neglect.
there was a decaying plant in a pot on
the Windowsill over the sink, the lloor
was sticky, and the tablecloth was
stained and taded, rotting in places as

it something wet had stayed on it too
long. She sat in the rocker tor a ino-
ment, letting her shoulders sag.

Saul called trom the bedroom and
she went in with his medicine. She
propped him up with pillows and he
swallowed the evil smeltingtluid. then
she made his bed comtortable,
straightening the sheets, turning the
pillows; there were low words between
them to bridge t he gap ol several years.

cluttered night stand.

"l'll be on the couch it you need me
in the night," she said.

She lay down putting an atghan over
her, but it was long belore she tell
asleep. Once in the night she awaken—
ed abruptly, tense and listening, but
she heard nothing except the night

the insect calls were silent. 1'“ call his
sister in the morning she thought, and
tell her that i can't possibly stay here.

When morning came she propped
Saul with pillows again so she could
teed him his cereal, and the ritual ot
their days together began.

She cleaned the kitchen, carelutly
treeing her mind ol any thoughts as
she worked, absorbed only in the
rhythm ot carrying soapy water, ol
washing and hanging curtains, scrub-
bi ng the sink. '1 he black phone on the
wall rung once, insistently, but she did
not answer its repeated summons.
Later someone knocked at the tront
door and she stopped, silently lrozen
on her knees until she was sure
whoever it was had gone away.

An End, and a Beginning

in rebruai'y, toward the end, the grip
ol winter loosened a little. Occasional-
ly the snow would turn to rain, and the
ice would sotten into slush. But she
could still see no promise ol spring in
the trees, no new buds, no sap singing
up into the branches— no release lrom
