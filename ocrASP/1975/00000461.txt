But Words

Will Never
Harm Me

by Ken Wax
eah, they know how to handle
Y scum like you," muttered the
cop who was pushing me
down the hallway deep inside Police
Headquarters. 1 would have snapped
back at him, but my mouth was taped
shut.

the incident that had me being
pushed into Police Semantic Division
started about live days ago, at a bar
wherel was drinking with a lady triend
ot mine. But to tully understand it We
have to go back to last summer.

1 took this sell detense course. Ver-
bal ‘sell detense. lt was taught at the 'Y’
by a small ,Uriental speech teacher,
lasted eight weeks, and cost torty
dollars. Money well spent.

For, quite a tew timest've had to deal
with ruttians who have started up with
me, and with verbal selt detense; t've
been able to decimate them quickly,
easily and without getting my clothes
mussed up. Bltective and etticient, its
helped me out ot several light spots,
and there were never any com-
plications. Until last weekend, that is.

Ast said betore, t was at this bar, and
a tetlow, actually he was more like a
Neanderthal man, eyebrow ridge and
all, started with me. He made a remark
ot desire to the woman 1 was with,
suggesting she "dump that creep”
(audaciously reterring to me) and at-
tach herselt to the man-ape. 1, ct
course, intervened in the intercourse,
and this missing link gets riled.

"Well, l'm gonna punch yourlace in,
punk," he growled. t decided to pre-
empt his attack, and planting my teet
shoulder length apart, let go with the
tirst ot an upcoming barrage.

Your mother never loved you," t
calmly thrust. He was stunned, in a
daze, a stupor. t toyed with him.

Your taste in clothing is poor, very
poor." the delivery was superb, the
condescending tone, matched the
pointed glare particularly well, and the
intlection, Well, it 1 do say so mysett,
was magnilicent. the Simian bent over
and tell to the tloor. this was the potnt
where l should have stopped.

But tor whatever reason. I suspect
the drinks were responsible, l decided
to have a tittletun. tn retrospect t know
it was wrong, but at the time . . . well,l
guess there is no excuse. . .

lctearedmythroat,andtoud enough

torthe whole place to hear. . ."Um, your
girltriend is taking orgasm." He
screamed out and contorted his body
in a spasmodic cringe. l was sipping a
glass ot water, preparing tor another
smash, when the door burst open and
two cops came in. Man-ape pulls
himsett up on one knee and says to the
cops

A Hit ln Ego

“this guy verbally assaulted me. Hit
me in the guilt and egothreetimes," he
moans. Une ot the cops, the shorter
one, bends down close to his head, and
asks it the hood it he wants to press
charges. He says he does. 1 explode:

"Utticer, thisis ridiculous! Why, this-.
. My outcry is cut oil by a pistol press~
ed to my temple.

“Any verbal projectiles trom you,"
he says slowly, like in the movies, "and
1 ll blow you away.” 1 thought ot intor-
ming him ot the maternally based guilt
inspiration ot his crude threat, but dis-
missed it as ill advised. t sat quietly
white the other cop called head-
quarters ("trauma on Bleeker and
2nd") to tind out what to do.

"they say to tape his mouth, we got
an ambulance coming torthisone," he
gestured towards man-ape. He was still
on the ttoor, rocking back and lorth, go-
ing "She couldn’t have been taking,
she couldn't've. . .

screeching, you could hearthe burn ot
the tires as the ambulance came to an
abrupt stop in tront ot the place. the
two attendants raced out ot the cab and
ran around to the back, which they
opened up with mindboggling speed.

Uut onto the Sidewalk they wheeled
a plush couch, and a goateed psy’

towards the police car. ‘You think
you re a tough man, donchaf"

screamed/yelled/taunted the short
one.
“Mtlrbmg smlnrg!" l hollered
through the tape.

And that how 1 tound myselt in
Semantics division, a small room,
bare save three chairs, two detectives,
a desk and an exposed lightbutb. A
cop had dragged me down the Police
Station halls, and into this room. He
threw me in a chair, spoke with the
detectives tor about a minute, then tell.

the rougher ot the two detectives
sauntered over to my chairandteaned
in close. "Well, it looks like we have a
real big talker here, doesn't it'?", he
grilled into my lace, a little spittte ot
saliva landing near my eye. “Yep,” he
assured himselt loudly, “a real tough
talker," and he turned away trom me.
I'd have let him have it right then and
there, but my mouth was still taped
shut. A truly helpless teeling.

"Hey, tough guy!" he started in
again, pulling a chair up so he sat two
inches away, ‘ Where the hell did you
get those shoes? Did ya lose a bet or are
you pledging a trat? Huh, punk'r’" he
chortted.

"And that shirt. . .Jeez, buddy that's
pretty nice. Do they make it your
tuckin‘ size? bh .r'" And heturned away,
in exagerated disgust, and told his
partner that he was going to get my tile.

"Hey, Sphincter, l'm going to get his
tile," he said.

No sooner does the door shut when
this other guy, Whose been silent until
now, comes over and otters me a
cigarette. tntroduces himselt as Joe, in
a real mellow tone. Ahah, 1 say to
myselt, the oldest trick in the book is
coming up.

"Listen buddy," Joe begins, "1 really
ought to warn you about Steve trelerr-
ing to the other detective). He's one
mean guy. And he was an HUD major
in college. Knows Socratic logic. A
black belt in it. He wasiust toying with

"Mel Ah, this is only a job to me. 1

problem at harvest time," he says, “last
year a cold spell in the midwest ruined
the corn crop; the country lost billions
ot dollars in tood." Bernard points out
that this was only because ot a teW
degrees. "Maybe you could create
large areas ot clouds to keep the heat
'in'  Bernard speculates that some li-
quid could be developed that would be
added to jet planeluets and then would
act as a nucleating agent when releas-
ed as exhaust. 'l‘his might keep the
cloud cover tor those dangerous
months.

Bernard has a controversial theory
about the cause ot lightning that is
catching on. lntroduced in 1955 while
he was working tor Arthur D. Little and
Co. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Ber-
nard's theory suggests that the electric
charge in clouds was caused by air
motions lilting trom the ground
positively charged cloud particles and
thus pushing negatively charged ones
down. The general beliet has been that
gravity is a tactor in the separation ot
positive and negative charges Within
the cloud.

Most scientists believe tornadoes are
caused by heat; Bernard thinks they
are electrically driven. Among his
evidence are nighttime pictures ot tor~
nadoes revealing that they emit light.
Bernard has an undergraduate, David
Keller, who is tinishing work on wind
velocities ot tornadoes. Keller is tin-
ding new evidence to support the
theory by tiring bits ot straw into
ditterent woods in various conditions.
the velocities necessary to imitate the
ettect on trees and buildings caused by
tornadoes are unexplainable with
traditional theories. Bernard believes
that electricity could be responSibte tor

that power.
Bernard builds up enormous phone
bills each spring, the tornadoes

season, to speak to eyewitnesses about
what they saw. His tornadotheory is no
longer ignored, though tor some years
it was.

the tornado pictures are lined up
opposite Bernard's desk so that he sits
with his back to them. On his tell are
the windows, one ol which displays a
Fresnel lens that makes it posstble to
view State Quadrangle on the extreme

right and the Administration Circle on
the extremelett even trom the middle
ot the room. "Counters tunnel vision,"
comments Bernard. He doesn't like the
WindoWs at SUNYA, nor the architec-
ture as a Whole.

"lt's inexcusable to have such ghast-
ty acoustics, such angles and heat loss.
ln a tire heavy people could never get
through these Windows. A triend ot
mine was reminded [by SUN YAJ ot a
tinal project in a school ot architecture

. .staying up all night to complete it."
One ot Bernard's tire sons is an
architect. "He‘d be glad to show them
where to place the charges around
here."

Bernard lives close by, in
Guilderland. He usually rides a "big
old Schwin" with tat tires to school.
though he broke a hip while riding two
years ago, Bernard points out that the
bike is sale since "you can run over a
drain Without tailing in."

His brother Kurt may have tallen into
a trap when he came to speak to
SUN YA's graduating class a lew years
ago. though the novelist Vonnegut
has, according to Bernard, "sworn a
lew times never to speak," he came up
alter tormer SUNYA President Louis ll
Benezet asked Bernard to discuss the
possibility with Kurt.

Bernard likes his brother's books.
And his intluence on Kurt is unv
mistakable.

ice-9', tor example. "l'm kind at con-
tused about that," says Bernard, ex~

Electric, where they told him "we en-
courage originality" and let him work
on what he pleased.

At a suggestion trom Bernard, Kurt
was recruited into General Electric's
public relations department. His ex-
perience in Schenectady is retlected
in his early book PlayerlJlano, a novel
about a one-company town that breaks
down.

Kurt then lett to treelance. "He cut
loose trom a steady job with a wile and
child," says Bernard. "it was
precarious. . . butt was sure he could
take care at himselt.”

And he did. Kurt had all kinds ot
work betore any ot his writing became
popular enough to support him. He
sold cars, wrote tor Sports Illustrated,
and spent time at an advertising agen-
cy. the junior Vonnegutthen emerged
over the past ten years as a leader in
popularized underground literature.

He Rigs Up Earphones

though without a training as intense
as Bernard's (at the Massachusetts In-
stitute ot 'l'echnologY), Kurt majored at
Cornell in Chemistry. lt was Bernard,
however, who tirst introduced

technology to Kurt when they were
children.

't rigged up some earphones lrom
my radio—rare in those days—to give
him tKurlJ something to do while in
bed," says Bernard.

"ll seemed to

 

cheer him up. But later he complained
that the radio wouldn‘t work; while
playing with some scissors he had cut
the leads oil the earphones and they
were almost impossible to tixl l was
turious, Wild. Mother thought it was
really tunny. But it turned out that he
had cut the sheets and pillow cases at
the same time."

Bernard says that Kurt was
humorous. "My sister Alice and l were
ademanding audience. . .hejokedat
dinner a lot." Not always wasthetamily
amused. Kurt and Alice tought and
Bernard remembers that "it was one ot
my mother's chores at one time to take
gum out ot Kurt's mouth alter he went
to bed—he got it ott telephone polls
during the day."

ramin lite included the arts. "Kurt
and Alice sang rustic country ballads,"
recalls Bernard, "andthey painted and
drew very well.

ln Welcome to the Monkey House,
Kurt writes: "My sister smoked too
much. Mytather smokedtoo much. My
mother smoked too much. l smoke too
much. My brother used to smoke too
much, and then he gave it up, Which
wasa miracle onthe orderot theloaves
and tishes."

But good work is no miracle.

Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. is writing out west.

Bernard Vonnegut is researching at
SUNYA. "New Science is questions
without answers,” says Bernard.

“So it goes," writes Kurt.

 

plaiiiing that Kurt‘s inspiration tor the
super-hard tictional ice tound in his
tirst bestseller Cal's Cradle was related
to the work Bernard was doing at
General btectric. He and other
researchers discussed their dis-
coveries and lantasies with Kurt, who
