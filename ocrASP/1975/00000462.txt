The Singer as Sexy Chameleon

M tongue like cotton candy,
which, once gone trom the
mouth, must be taken and taken again.
Melissa. Her curly black mane lrames
an enigmatic lace: her persistently
pouting mouth and breathless voice
reveal a knowing, worldly soul, only to
be betrayed by theintensity ol her dark
brown eyes which, even in the cold
tluorescence ol her dressing room,
echo her admittedly contused psyche,
searching tor lullillment, tor organiza-
tion.

"l'm terribly disorganized," she said.
‘1 always learned mostly trom doing,
but I never liked to be told what to do.
You sutler, because you don't get dis-
cipline.

"Discipline is an amazing thing,
because you see what your goal is, and
you see what it takes to go alter it. it’s a
tremendous gilt, to be able to lind the
balance between discipline and ac-
tion. When it’s all action, then it’s all
very emotional, and you're hungry tor
a little bit ol logic."

Organization, discipline, logic. Her
words evoke a sense ol lormality, ot
regimentation. Clearly not the image
she presents on stage. Saucy and sexy,
sultry and sensuous, she sings to her
audience, pleads, cajoles, and at once
the crowd belongs to her. She leeds on
their excitement and their applause,
taking trom them while giving them
what they had come tor. a taste ot her
heady, moody diversity ol perlor-
mance,

' l'here s a cast ol a thousand
characters in this body. l'rn really kind
)1 chameleon-like, because the thing
that changes is the music, giving me a
kind ot emotional charge. It's not that
l'm acting, 'or lying, just reacting to the
energy ol the music.

When the music gets really hully, it
gets me going. it's really a tremendous
sense ot power  not really 'tough,’
though: you'd be morelikely totind me

uberance, vitality and sensuality when perlorming.

sitting in lront ot the TV thanin an alley
somewhere."

Maybe you wouldn‘t run into
Melissa Manchesterin a dark alley, but
you probably wouldn't lind her
watching television either since her
single, "Midnight blue" became atop
40's hit. Unless she was watching
herselt 

"t‘ve been on ‘l'V alot more(sincethe
hit). 1 did 'Don Kirschner’s Hock Con-
cert, the 'Mike Douglas Show,‘ the
Dinah Shore Show.’ " On the talk
shows, she said, ” You lose spontaneity,
You're playing to an audience ol lilty
shopping bags. it you start to get crazy,

they ask you, ‘ls something the matter,’

dear? " Her preterred medium is the
stage, her act livened with theatrical
antics.

"Vampy, campy, reminiscient ol
Bette Midler (with whom she once
sang), she has incorporated into her
pertormance more and more
’raunchiness" overthe past tour years.
"My hulliness is part ot my maturation
process, i suppose. it's the yin and the
yang ot becoming hullier and wanting
to dance more and wanting to sing
more. People tell me, 'You mess

around so much in live peitormances
and you can't capture that on recordfl
don‘t know about that, it's just the en:
vironment ol live pertormances, that
element ot live is there."

the intensity ot a live pertormance is
a lorm ol communication, and her
message is tound in her songs, which
she writes alone or with Carole Sager,
Vini Pocia (her producer) or David
Wollert (her guitarist). the sentiment,
she claims, is always her own.

Sensory, Sensual Music

"Musm is such a personal thing, all
my music is personal. that vehicle tor
communication is such a purely sen-
sory thing, it's logical thatit's ultimately
asensory, sensual thing. it leels good to
soar, or to slide, it leels so good to sing
words sometimes. You ultimately want
to communicate an idea. It's really
hard to be simple, but through the
ages, the ideas that have moved
anybody have been simple, that's what
Paul Simon taught me."

Paul Simon, Stevte Wonder, Sly
Stone, Joni Mitchell, Donny Hathaway,
tor all ol these she says she has a

learn more. "

 

 

"special place in (her) heart." the in-
tluences and inspirations that she has
had are credited not only to her con~
temporaries, but tothose ot another era
as well. "‘l'he list is endless. l was ex-
posed to so many dillerent types ol
music and pertormers, opera~my
lather was with the Met opera
orchestrawsymphonic music, to jazz to
rock to Aretha Franklin to Streisand, to
Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, 'l'ony
Bennett, Lilla Fitzgerald, Leoiityne
Price, and those are just the singers.
then there's the novelists, and the
playwrights, it's just really endless."

bndless background, but lew have
endless careers. Her luture goals are
manitold, ‘l dream. t'd liketo be able to
reach people. to like to write
children's stories, study music. I have
to learn, more."

l've learned alot. You have to. l've
grown in terms 0t learning how to
pack, getting up very early, going to
bed very late, the very makeup ol my
personality has changed, You just try
to get better at what you do. Your
values change. things that you value
are becoming more valuable because
at demands 01 time. You value privacy
that much more, being lett alonejust to
think."

lime and privacy are scarce corri-
modities to Melissa Manchester, who is
now at work on her lourth album. but
tier greatest lrustration is not so much
personal as ll is prolessional, her dis~
satislaction With the treatment ol rock
mUSlC as a legitimatelacet ol the musuc

critics at today have replaced the Hed-
da Hoppers and Louella Parsons ot
yesterday. Why shouldn't contem-

about as classrcal muSic? it's a Vital
lorce in our culture."

And no better a personitication ot a

ol Melissa Manchester, the lireball
woman-child with the cotton candy
name.

More than a Quad Party

by Edward Rader
here couldn't have been more
I than a dozen people in the
Eighth Step when we walked
in, and it was a Saturday night. My lirst
thought was that this may not be the
place to be on a Saturday night in
Albany. 'l'here were a lew couples, and
older couple with a boy ol about
eleven, two young women and a cou»
ple ot older than students men who
where there by themselves. Hmm.
More doubts, the place itselt was a
small, not quite linished basement
stocked with maybe ten, twelve tables,
a lew loose chairs in rows, and an old
sota on either side. We were enter~
tained by two young men with guitars
ol whom 1 had never heard.

i stayed tor all three shows, it would
be dilticult to think ol a more relaxing
atmosphere in which to hear good
music and i plan on going back there
soon.

The Eighth Step Collee House,
located downstairs lrom the First
Preybeterian Church on Willett St, is a
tar cry lrom quad parties, happy hours,
and wall to wall concerts, it's a placeto
go to take it easy. You can sip collee or
sample a variety to lind an audience

made up of local residents as well as
students trom the dillerent colleges in
the Albany area. Nobodythereis likely
to ask you what quad you live on.

'l'here‘s live music 'l'uesdaythrough
Saturday night. ‘l‘hursday nights alter-
nate between Open Night, when
anyone with an instrument and the
nerve can take a crack at the stage,
and Hootenanny Night, which is tor
those who are into jamming. Monday
nights are set aside tor chess, cards,
and various kinds ol discussion.

On the weekends there are
protessional acts, usually culled lrom
the ranks ol either the Picking orSing-
iiig Gathering Circuit or the Chelsea
Circuit, both ol which help circulate
country and lolk actsto collee houses
and cates inthe Northeast. it all the acts
are anywhere as good as the onel saw,
then thebighth Stepmust have some ol
the best musrc in tcwn.

We were entertaned by Dick ber-

Despite all it has going tor it the
highth Step is havrng serious
problems. According to manager John
Koethen, the Freeze Dried Collee

biggest problem is that the tLighth Stop,
