he number ot plays involving
T the moon which have been
pertormed on campus this
year will soon be joined by another.

Joining Dark 0! the Moon and,

Moonchildren is The Ettect ot Gam-
ma Rays on Man-in-theMoon
Marigolds, which will be put on lrom
October 22 through the 25th.

the play, produced by James
Leonard ol the SUNYA theatre depart
ment, has already called rehearsals.
Just how much work is put into the
production belorehand ls apparent
trorn seeing the practices.

l’erlormers in one night's rehearsal
show up in the Studio theatre belore '/
pm. As producer Leonard gives direc-
tions to stage manager Sheila
Harrington, the cast got ready. Joyce
t'arra, as one daughter, 'l'illle, sits on the
edge ot the stage, pulling on her white
anktets. the socks and her long skirt
resemble a parochial school unilorm.
'lhe two other girls on stage, Handy
Kaplan in her bright blue bathrobe as
Beatrice (or betiy the Loon, as she's
called in the play) and Deborah
beecherl as Huth, check through their
props and steps, according to
Leonard's directions

"ls this real honey?" asks Joyce.

 

 

Rehearsing actors work on character truth in the PAC Studio Theater, as
preparations for “The Effect ol Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds"

‘lhat's real honey, real Golden
blossom,“ answers Leonard. Joyce
runs up and down the take staircase on
the side ot the stage. "'l'hese stairs are
so nice-so secure." but tall,
brownhalred Deborah comments,
"this banlster is too low tor me."
Finally, the rehearsal ol Act 1 begins.
the silence is overpowering, as Joyce
gets into her Character. Leonard
whispers, "We' re working on personal
truth, character truth."

As Joyce goes through her lirst
speech, 1 look over the stage. "the set-
up has evolved a great deal trom the
picture ot it in the ASP 5 lew weeks
ago. Where there were tolding chairs,
there are now two old, worn, reddish-
brown stutted chairs. One still has the
tag on it, as it the tamin in the play
lorgot to remove it. 'l'here is now a take
doorway to the tell, and the staircase.
An old, scratched, woodentable, anda
dirty white sink have been added, too.
Ladders in the back ot the stage imply
that the set isn't quite completed. the

1 whole eltect is ol a tacky, but kept~up

apartment.

"take it back," Sheila yells, asa line
is lorgotten. As Handy goes back tor
her line, the cord ot the phone she is us—
ing tangles and the phone crashes to
the ttoor. Leonard later decides to
move the phone tor the actual perlor-
mances. Hulls happen, but they are
lew and tar between.

t'inally, Nanny enters, played by
Jerusha Kaminski. She is the last
character to enter the lirst Act. She
shuttles across the stage with her
walker, her arms straining, seeming
not io notice anything. the walker and
her teet almost torm a musical accom-

“ You/eel youjust have to be there, whether you have a

1/ 0° fever or what. "

tle touches have been added tothe set,
like the school books on the table, in-
cluding one at those black and white
marble-cover notebooks no grammar
school student used to be without.
"Uooh, it‘s starting to look like a real
apartment," says Joyce.

'l'alk turns to costumes. Handy has
seen the hat tor one ol her scenes. "the
hat was very, very stylish, real tacky
4U's—llke that would make it almost
'/U’s." Deborah comes out on stage
now, pulling on her socks. "My mother
si sending my saddleshoes in the
mall," she says. She will use them lor
the play. I ‘

the next big topic is the bra Deborah
wears in a scene later in the play. "it's
kind ot tunny and bunchy," she com-
plains. Handy agrees, calling it a "bat—
tle bra."

Handy expains how she teetstoward
the play. "You teel you just have to be
there, whether you have a 110” lever
or what," she says, throwing hersetl
against the wall in a mock death scene.
'lt’s kind ol convoluted," she con-
tinues. 'You really should take Care at
yoursell." She adds, a player can study
lines at home,"  butalottakes place

the characters ot Nanny and
beatrlce do not get along. When, in a tit
ol anger, beatrice throwsa pile ol laun-
dry over the bannister, a towel lands,

plop on Jerusha's head. She
manages to keep down a grin. lt is an
acctdent, but the lnCident certainly tits
in With what beatrice would like to do
to Nanny.

As the rehearsal breaks up, the
players relax on the stage. Sheila
bnngs out a thermos ot hot cider. "Isn't
this a nice tainlly picture?" Joyce says,
as mother and "daughter collapse on
the sold. "be sure you're leellng, be
loose," Leonard advises them. "Settle,
settle, settle."

things do seem more settled the
next nigtil at rehearsal. the set has
changed in just a day. the staircase is
painted, the backdrop, something like

 

large lence, has been expanded. Lit-

home."

the play may deserve the players
dedication to it, Since it was long in
planning. "ll usually takes us one
whole year," Leonard explains, to
choose the season schedule. the
theatre department gets input trom the
student theatre council, he says. Gam-
ma Rays was chosen partly because
lew plays otter strong women's roles.
this play, Leonard says,"  gives us
a chance to have an all temale cast." tt
Wlll balance the all male cast at
Waiting tor Godot, which starts oil the
season."

Despite all the work put into it, the
play will soon be over. but one
reminder may be around tor a while.
the play calls tor a rabbit, which
Leonard got lrom a rabbit larm. "We’re
sort ot babysitting," Leonard says,
when asked who’s taking care ot it
now. When Gamma Rays is over,
someone wlll end up with a souvenir.
